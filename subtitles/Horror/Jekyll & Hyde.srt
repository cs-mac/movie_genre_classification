<i>Episode 14</i>

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,480
<i>[Robin]</i>

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,260
<i>- Robin.
- Hi, Doctor Yoon.</i>

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,700
<i>- I'm here.
- Okay.</i>

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,450
Can I come up right now?

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,030
<i>Yes, come on up.</i>

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,590
Okay.

9
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,260
As of today, balloons are
strictly forbidden.

10
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,040
<i>The marble.</i>

11
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,540
<i>There was a marble.</i>

12
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,630
Robin has figured it out.

13
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,790
<i>Lee Soo Hyun is...</i>

14
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,440
<i>Doctor Yoon Tae Joo.</i>

15
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,860
How about doing it like this?

16
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,950
You said that you're not very
susceptible to hypnotism, right?

17
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,630
Is it really Doctor Yoon Tae Joo?

18
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,050
He just pressed the doorbell.

19
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,390
- Robin?
- Yes.

20
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,410
<i>Is it you?</i>

21
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,950
<i>Are you Lee Soo Hyun?</i>

22
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,090
Come on in.

23
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,560
Have a seat.
Would you like a cup of tea?

24
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,080
Yes, please.

25
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,030
You're saying that you remember
Goo Seo Jin's memory of the kidnapping?

26
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:28,460
Yes, I only remembered parts of it before,
but I remember pretty much everything now.

27
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,790
Doctor Kang told me something before.

28
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:40,620
That I was created by Seo Jin because of
the trauma he received from being kidnapped.

29
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,120
Which means that his kidnapping
was how I got my beginning.

30
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,930
But Seo Jin rarely ever talked about
what happened to him.

31
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,510
Because he and I have spent
all these years as enemies.

32
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,590
Then what you're remembering now is
something that you had no recollection of?

33
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,290
Yes.

34
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,620
From what I've been able to tell

35
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:07,030
he hasn't been able to completely forget
the trauma of what's happened

36
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,030
and still retains some of those
memories.

37
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,960
- Yes, but what does that mean?
- It means...

38
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,390
when he was taken back to the warehouse
and had to relive his kidnapping incident

39
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,040
all his old memories came
rushing back to him...

40
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,440
and it seems that he wasn't
quite able to handle that.

41
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:28,050
So that's why he passed those
memories onto me...

42
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,350
Yes, that's right.

43
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,000
He's gone back into hiding.

44
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,110
I'm not sure... if those memories
are even worth hiding from.

45
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,640
- Excuse me?
- Ah...

46
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,640
Granted, it's different for
Seo Jin and I.

47
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:51,340
Since I have no way of knowing how these
memories are perceived from Seo Jin's end.

48
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,340
What is it that you've remembered?

49
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,360
That's...

50
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:02,050
It's a bit of a mess.

51
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,830
Parts of the memories are very clear,
but other parts are very fuzzy.

52
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,440
Okay, then let's get them
all out in the open.

53
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,790
Let's see if we can get you to remember
everything that happened that day.

54
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:20,040
The reason why you came to be...
and why Goo Seo Jin has disappeared.

55
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,680
<i>Hypnosis?</i>

56
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,840
He's suggesting hypnosis.

57
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,770
Okay, he's going to start the hypnosis.

58
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,640
Shall we get started?

59
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,330
I need you to focus.

60
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,640
I'm going to count to three.

61
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,780
One.

62
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,530
Two.

63
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,290
Three.

64
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,660
Robin?

65
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,340
You don't think he's
really hypnotized, do you?

66
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,950
December 25, 1992.

67
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,960
It's Christmas Day.

68
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,940
You are at Wonderland Park.

69
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,290
- What are you doing right now?
- I'm standing around.

70
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,830
- Where?
- In front of the Ghost House.

71
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,730
- Shall we go inside?
- No.

72
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,930
- Why not?
- I'm waiting.

73
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,150
- Waiting for whom?
- A friend.

74
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,880
- Why?
- Because he told me to come.

75
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:44,040
- To the Ghost House?
- He's there.

76
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,120
- Your friend is there?
- Yes.

77
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,450
- I'm going inside.
- Okay.

78
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,440
Go on in.

79
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:57,610
- And you'll soon be kidnapped, right?
- I'm being dragged away.

80
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,430
Are you sure he's not
really hypnotized?

81
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:10,280
- You're being dragged away?
- Yes.

82
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,880
- With your friend?
- Yes.

83
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,230
- Together?
- Yes.

84
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,390
No, that's not right.

85
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:32,220
Seo Jin was dragged off first, and
Soo Hyun grabs onto the kidnapper.

86
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:36,370
Soo Hyun asks the kidnapper
why he's dragging Seo Jin away.

87
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:43,450
Soo Hyun continues to cling onto the kidnapper
even after being shoved and kicked away.

88
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,700
<i>'Mister, please don't do this
to Seo Jin!'</i>

89
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,140
That's where things start to differ.

90
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,710
Between your memories...

91
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,900
and my memories.

92
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,190
Don't you agree?

93
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,240
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>

94
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,220
You're wondering how I
know all this?

95
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,370
<i>That's because...</i>

96
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,000
That's because...

97
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,530
<i>- You are...
- I'm...</i>

98
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,240
I'm your friend...

99
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,190
Lee Soo Hyun.

100
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,820
I had my doubts...

101
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,110
but how can this actually be true?

102
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,450
We've got him!
Get in there!

103
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,360
Ha Na, stay here where it's safe.

104
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,610
I've been wanting to meet with you.

105
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,600
I wanted to resolve everything.

106
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,860
All the resentment and rage that
I've been tormented by all these years...

107
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,880
But the thing that angers me
the most...

108
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,920
is that even though I've so desperately...

109
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:09,440
been waiting for this
exact moment all my life...

110
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:14,660
Why is it that I'm having to speak to
Robin, whom you're hiding behind...

111
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,970
instead of saying this
to your face directly?

112
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,420
Soo Hyun.

113
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,970
Lee Soo Hyun.

114
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,550
Goo Seo Jin?

115
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,400
Come quickly!

116
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,980
We're heading up right now,
so block all access to the elevator!

117
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,960
The police have the outside surrounded.

118
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,460
They just heard our whole conversation,
and they also know that you're Lee Soo Hyun.

119
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,100
Shut up.

120
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,330
It isn't going to end like this.

121
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:37,190
It's the police!
Open up!

122
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,520
<i>Lee Soo Hyun, open the door!</i>

123
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,340
<i>Lee Soo Hyun, open the door!</i>

124
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,620
Lee Soo Hyun, open the door!

125
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,810
It's all over now.
Just accept it.

126
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,950
This could be our last chance to talk.

127
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:05,830
The first and the last time...
that we'll get to talk face-to-face.

128
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,130
Lee Soo Hyun, open the door!

129
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,970
I think we're going to have to
break through the door.

130
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,340
- Call 119 for backup.
- Yes, sir.

131
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,710
- Call 119 immediately.
- Lee Soo Hyun, open the door!

132
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,610
First, I'd like to apologize.

133
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,770
I sincerely apologize.

134
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,360
For what I did to you

135
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,720
and for all the years that I've lived my
life without remembering the past.

136
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,340
Apologize?

137
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,540
This is your idea of a sincere apology?

138
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,990
Apologizing to you wasn't
my only purpose for coming here.

139
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,000
Then you're waiting for me
to apologize back?

140
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,410
- I have nothing to apologize to you for.
- No.

141
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,450
- I came to resolve something.
- Solve what?

142
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:46,240
The young kids you and I once used to be
after having been hurt and left abandoned.

143
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:51,040
And our lives that got
destroyed after that incident.

144
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,450
But in order for that to happen,
we both need to know...

145
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,710
the real truth behind
what happened that day.

146
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,390
What happened?

147
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,590
Why did it turn off?

148
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,150
Director Goo?
Director Goo!

149
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:21,060
- Is 119 on their way?
- Yes, they're on their way right now.

150
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,920
- So you really didn't know?
- Know what?

151
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,350
You didn't call me
out there on purpose, right?

152
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:30,810
- You weren't in on it too, right?
- In on what?

153
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,810
Your father.

154
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:36,090
You didn't know that your father
was the kidnapper's co-conspirator?

155
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,980
Don't make me laugh.

156
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,420
- That never happened.
- Are you sure?

157
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,310
No, it didn't!
Stop trying to make up stories.

158
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:46,310
You're actually implying that
my father was the culprit?

159
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:49,310
- I'm saying that we were victimized.
- Victimized?

160
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,490
Victims?

161
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,290
Who gave you the right to
call yourself a victim?

162
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,030
You ran away that day, and
you haven't lost anything in your life

163
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,530
so how can you be the victim?

164
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:04,220
Because none of us wanted
that to happen!

165
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,990
You and I both... experienced something
that neither one of us wanted to.

166
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,410
So...

167
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:14,540
you're saying that my father is responsible
for everything that happened?

168
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,420
No.

169
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,150
My father has never abandoned me.

170
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:24,360
The only person that abandoned us...
was your father.

171
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,020
<i>Open the door!</i>

172
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,660
<i>Lee Soo Hyun, open the door!</i>

173
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:35,890
- So what is it that you want?
- We were just little kids.

174
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,990
Just two little kids who were abandoned
by none other than our own fathers.

175
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,120
No, that's not true.

176
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,140
- Not me.
- It's okay to admit it.

177
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,720
Even if you admit it and accept it...

178
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,580
both of us ultimately survived
in the end.

179
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,330
No matter how difficult it was,
and torturous it may have been...

180
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,990
isn't the fact that we're both still alive
what really matters?

181
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,900
And more importantly, the
lives we both still have left to live.

182
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,800
What a joke.

183
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,940
I'm sure you just need an excuse
to carry on with your life.

184
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,240
There's no evidence to prove
that my father did any of those things.

185
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,170
You're just going off of
what you think you remember.

186
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:13,320
And for me to trust any
of those memories in your head?

187
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:17,140
You are just too untrustworthy.

188
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,790
All you did was manipulate
the memories in your head.

189
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,760
So that you can just run away again.

190
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:32,240
To be honest, there are times
when I still doubt myself.

191
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,330
Because just like you said, I
wonder if I'm just fabricating something

192
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,830
in my head for me to hide behind again.

193
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,220
Because I've spent my whole life
blaming and doubting myself.

194
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,750
That's why I want to verify it
beyond the shadow of a doubt.

195
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,150
Give me the answer that I seek.
You weren't in on it?

196
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:50,790
- And you really don't remember?
- No, I don't remember.

197
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,790
That is my honest answer.

198
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,370
<i>This is your final warning!
Open the door!</i>

199
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,890
<i>Lee Soo Hyun!</i>

200
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,740
I think the time for our
face-to-face conversation is over.

201
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,430
Doctor Kang is here.

202
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,000
Go find her.

203
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,290
Doctor Kang... is here?

204
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:29,380
- Is 119 not here yet?
- What's the status on 119?

205
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,290
- They've just arrived in the lobby.
- Tell them to hurry and get up here!

206
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,180
Doctor Kang.

207
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,590
Get him!

208
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,630
Lee Soo Hyun!

209
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,060
He's headed down the emergency
stairwell. Block him!

210
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,570
Stop right there!

211
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,560
Lee Soo Hyun!

212
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,280
He got on the elevator from the
fifth floor, and he's headed down.

213
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,140
He's still in the building.

214
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,680
Freeze!

215
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,840
Slowly get down on the ground,
and place your hands on your head.

216
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,830
<i>You're all familiar
with this song, aren't you?</i>

217
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,900
You're all...

218
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,880
familiar with this song, aren't you?

219
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,820
Keep up the good work.

220
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,230
Wait... what are you even
saying right now?

221
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,280
How could you have lost him!

222
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:23,150
- It was the song.
- The song?

223
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:26,740
- What song?
- The song he used during our hypnotherapy.

224
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,080
He must've used the song
to hypnotize us in some way.

225
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,120
He's right, we couldn't even
move a muscle.

226
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:55,020
Director Goo!

227
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,320
Doctor Kang.

228
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,300
Are you okay?
Are you hurt anywhere?

229
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,640
Why did you turn off the wire?
You promised you wouldn't do that.

230
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,190
What if something happened to you?

231
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:44,450
- Oh my, I guess love knows no bounds.
- How did it go?

232
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,050
Um...

233
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,200
He got away.

234
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:51,290
We're canvassing all surrounding areas

235
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:55,780
and now that we know who the culprit is,
we're going to send out an APB...

236
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,820
- We're focusing everything...
- Doctor Yoon Tae Joo is Lee Soo Hyun?

237
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,880
Seo Jin, I really am sorry about this.
Wow...

238
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,640
I should've picked up on it since I'm better
at noticing things than most people.

239
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,510
The truth is,
I had a gut feeling about the guy.

240
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:15,930
Anyway, I'm so relieved to hear
that Doctor Kang is still alive and well.

241
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,200
It's all my fault.

242
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,260
I jumped the gun too early.

243
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:27,780
When I found out that Doctor Yoon Tae Joo
was really Lee Soo Hyun

244
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:33,520
I thought that the mere fact
that both of you were still alive

245
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,660
was enough to forgive each other
and mend your relationship.

246
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:39,420
But you didn't know about the piece
of memory that I had forgotten.

247
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:44,430
Lee Soo Hyun is in the exact
same boat.

248
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:48,890
He's selectively erased any parts of his
memory that he couldn't bear to accept.

249
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:54,220
As it is with anyone, the greatest pain
you feel are those that you allow to fester.

250
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:00,160
What you've done is turned that pain
into self-blame

251
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:04,000
and Lee Soo Hyun turned it into
feelings of rage and revenge.

252
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:10,090
As for the matter of Soo Hyun's father,
I haven't been able to verify it yet.

253
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:14,600
Soo Hyun vehemently denied it,
and I'm only going off of my memories.

254
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:19,370
- But what if it turns out to be the truth?
- Then it'll become very dangerous.

255
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:25,110
For him to admit and accept the truth now...

256
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,520
He's already gone too far for that.

257
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,910
Even though his start
may have been accidental

258
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:34,660
he's still a criminal now,
and his life is already ruined.

259
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,210
- He now has nothing else left to lose.
- No.

260
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:41,180
There is still one thing left.

261
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:47,660
He still has one weapon left
that he can use to attack you.

262
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,560
You have to stop him from that.

263
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:55,270
Come in.

264
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,700
I was told that you need to
get your blood pressure tested.

265
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:11,470
- Are you Jang Ha Na?
- Yes.

266
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:15,150
I know I must've caused you
a great deal of trouble lately.

267
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,150
- Thank you for everything.
- No, not at all.

268
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:21,140
If anything, I'm just
grateful that you're safe.

269
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:28,070
And I'm even more grateful that
you've remained by Seo Jin's side.

270
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:38,300
- Doctor Kang has been found?
- Yes!

271
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,860
Director Goo, Robin, and Ha Na have
pieced together all the clues

272
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,710
and they came up with the plan
to solve everything!

273
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:46,550
They've even figured out that
Doctor Yoon is the real Lee Soo Hyun.

274
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,930
What? Yoon Tae Joo?
Doctor Kang's pupil?

275
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,540
Yes, the police have issued
a nationwide arrest warrant for him.

276
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:56,340
His face has been known everywhere,
and there's nowhere for him to escape to.

277
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,680
- I'm sure he'll soon be captured.
- And also...

278
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,880
- Director Goo hadn't disappeared.
- What?

279
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,130
What does that mean?
He tricked us?

280
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:08,440
Yes, that's what it means.
I actually feel pretty disappointed.

281
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,870
But don't you remember
what Doctor Minsky told us?

282
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:15,860
That Director Goo's disappearance
was the most important sign.

283
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,980
Yes, he did say that.

284
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:22,650
He said the danger would've been if he
continued to keep disappearing like that

285
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:26,580
but since he never actually disappeared,
there's no real threat of any danger.

286
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,560
I'm begging you, Chairman Goo.

287
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,360
Your constant desire to send him overseas,
and locking him up in a hospital...

288
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:35,460
Please stop saying things like that.

289
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:41,690
Secretary Kwon,
you really are starting to sound...

290
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,060
Director Goo.

291
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,570
Even though it was only for
a short moment...

292
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:59,030
I think I'm actually
able to understand you now.

293
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:06,690
I've been putting my trust and
faith into Doctor Yoon all this time...

294
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,890
but the moment that I realized
that he really is Lee Soo Hyun...

295
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,550
I felt like I couldn't trust anyone
anymore.

296
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:20,950
I felt so stupid and pathetic for
all the things that I had believed in...

297
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:25,420
and it made me feel like I'm clueless
when it comes to knowing who people are.

298
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:28,900
But in your case...

299
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:33,310
it was your father, and
the closest friend that you had.

300
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,020
And to know that
it was your friend's father...

301
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,960
Had I been in your shoes

302
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,140
I don't know if I would've been
able to survive like you had.

303
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:49,170
You've done... really well for yourself.

304
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:06,230
Why aren't you saying anything?

305
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:13,630
Having someone in the room with me
while I left Robin a message...

306
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,570
I never would've even imagined it.

307
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,340
I finally met with Lee Soo Hyun.

308
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:36,080
And we were also fortunate enough
to safely rescue Doctor Kang.

309
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,240
Even though we weren't
able to capture Lee Soo Hyun

310
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,210
now that we know who he is,
we should soon be able to capture him.

311
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:44,200
Thank you.
I sincerely mean that.

312
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:49,100
Even though we only
accomplished half the goal

313
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,550
we still wouldn't have been
able to do it without your help.

314
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,080
But there's one thing
that I'm still unhappy about.

315
00:26:55,730 --> 00:27:00,450
And that's the fact that this is the only
way for the two of us to face each other.

316
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:17,060
<i>The marble.
There was a marble.</i>

317
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:21,380
<i>I think I know who Lee Soo Hyun is.</i>

318
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:25,600
<i>Lee Soo Hyun is Doctor Yoon Tae Joo.</i>

319
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,940
Was it really difficult?

320
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:57,050
What is it?

321
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,800
What are you dreaming about?

322
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:46,640
<i>Your father was
the kidnapper's co-conspirator.</i>

323
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,780
<i>We were just little kids that were abandoned
by none other than our own fathers.</i>

324
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,730
No, that's not true.

325
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:56,010
<i>You both experienced a living nightmare
that's tough to handle.</i>

326
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:58,320
<i>Do you think Seo Jin was the only one
who wanted to forget?</i>

327
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,780
<i>I'm different.</i>

328
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:03,110
<i>I'm different from Goo Seo Jin.</i>

329
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,130
<i>That can't be true.</i>

330
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,990
<i>[A nationwide APB issued for
kidnapper, Lee Soo Hyun.]</i>

331
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,620
<i>The culprit responsible for the kidnapping
of Doctor Kang Hee Ae</i>

332
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,360
<i>and for the kidnapping of
Wonder Group's Goo Seo Jin</i>

333
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,090
<i>has been identified as Lee Soo Hyun.</i>

334
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:27,140
So the police haven't caught him yet,
and he's on the run?

335
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:31,000
Yes, it sounds like it. What if
he threatens my sweeties again?

336
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:35,440
<i>The phone you are trying to reach
has been turned off...</i>

337
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:39,630
Robin, it's me.
Can you please call Woo Jung?

338
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:43,740
She's very worried about you, and
it worries me to see Woo Jung so worried.

339
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:47,080
So please make sure to
call her back, okay?

340
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,050
Isn't that what you were
going to do yourself?

341
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:55,170
- Yeah, but why...
- Why do you think?

342
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,800
I'm trying to stake my claims.

343
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:02,920
His real name is Lee Soo Hyun,
and he's 33 years in age.

344
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,580
He's a US citizen, and there
aren't any records of his adoption.

345
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,760
He's just listed as the son of Yoon Sung Mi,
a Korean-American immigrant.

346
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,950
Then the reason why we couldn't find anything
on him was because he's a US citizen?

347
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,350
Yes, that's correct.

348
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:18,820
During Doctor Kang Hee Ae's tenure
at Johns Hopkins Hospital back in 2011

349
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:22,280
they worked together in
the research program for two years.

350
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:26,270
It's estimated that's when he started to
formulate his revenge plans on Lee Soo Hyun

351
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,720
and it was with that purpose in mind
that he intentionally approached Doctor Kang.

352
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:34,740
He came to Korea with Doctor Kang
in 2013 when she made her return

353
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:40,840
and he secured his position at
Hankyeol Hospital as its resident professor.

354
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,990
After confiscating Lee Soo Hyun's computer
and having searched through it

355
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:50,100
it's been noted that he ran a search on
Goo Seo Jin on a daily basis.

356
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,860
As you can also see, all the key search words
are also related to Goo Seo Jin.

357
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:56,850
- So he carefully premeditated his plans?
- Yes, that's correct.

358
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:59,040
What else have you identified?

359
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,530
There are actually two office spaces
that are listed under his name

360
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:05,230
so we're searching nearby
both those places.

361
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,870
But we haven't been able to
locate him yet.

362
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:10,790
Something odd that we've noticed
upon checking through his call logs

363
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,340
is that he doesn't have any friends.

364
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,770
He doesn't have any friends,
or anyone else that he keeps in contact with.

365
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,130
The only people that he's been

366
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,000
in recent contact with are Goo Seo Jin,
Jang Ha Na, and Ahn Sung Goon.

367
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,220
With only those three on the call list,
the rest is pretty obvious.

368
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,650
Thus, with our current bit of information,
we can only rely on the tips that comes in.

369
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:27,170
First, we must secure the safety of
Goo Seo Jin, and Jang Ha Na's surroundings

370
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,500
- and the kidnapper...
- Jung Man Shik.

371
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,170
Yeah, and he's at
Taeyang hospital, correct?

372
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:33,600
Call and alert the hospital.

373
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,220
The chances are pretty high that
he'll be targeting there next.

374
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:45,150
Yes, sir.

375
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,100
Yes.

376
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,710
Yes, I understand.

377
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,520
What was that all about?

378
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,350
Lee Soo Hyun, the guy on
the wanted list...

379
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:58,130
I guess he may be targeting the hospital,
so they want us to stay alert.

380
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:44,710
- He needs to be taken for his CAT scan.
- Okay, hang on.

381
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,360
Can you please lower
your face mask?

382
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,780
I said, I need you to lower
your face mask.

383
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:20,300
What's taking so long in there?

384
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,150
Here he comes.

385
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,770
We had to give him some sedatives due
to an adverse effect that he had to the dye.

386
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:37,170
- Leave him to get some rest.
- Yes, I understand.

387
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,610
During the life I've led
since the kidnapping...

388
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:16,090
I've really endured a lot.

389
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,680
But...

390
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:25,990
I didn't think that I'd be able to
endure ever having to see you again...

391
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:29,720
So I tried to make an effort
to never see you again.

392
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,590
I was simply...

393
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:37,550
going to let you rot away
for the rest of your life in prison...

394
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:43,680
for the crime of murder that you're not
aware of as a price for your sins.

395
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,630
But I don't think that's going
to be enough.

396
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:53,030
That's not enough of a price
for your sins.

397
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,700
What?

398
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:02,900
They're sure that it was Jung Man Shik
that went in for the scan

399
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,580
but it was the scan technician
who came back out.

400
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:07,120
It seems Lee Soo Hyun was hiding
in the scan room.

401
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,980
That's why I made the phone call
for them to keep a close eye on him!

402
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,960
They couldn't recognize that it was
a different person

403
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,930
just because of some bandages
on his face?

404
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,870
What if he used hypnosis on them?

405
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:18,200
If he hypnotized them
like he did to us the other night

406
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,650
then they would've been
rendered helpless.

407
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:23,210
That was that post-hypnotic response
or whatever that he did to us.

408
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,600
Don't you remember?

409
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,950
'You're all familiar
with this song, aren't you?'

410
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,690
Was that a universal hypnosis
signal or what?

411
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:33,210
Every single person is susceptible to it!

412
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:36,260
Then... we've just been had again?

413
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:45,070
At this point, doesn't it seem right
that we submit our letter of resignation?

414
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:51,250
But I'm going to maintain my position,
and I vow to capture him with my own hands.

415
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,750
Lee Soo Hyun...
kidnapped Jung Man Shik?

416
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,220
I'm sure it was because he wanted to
verify the story I told him.

417
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:06,650
Yes, he's completely obsessed with you.

418
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:08,660
Now that he's got Jung Man Shik

419
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:11,950
we have no way of predicting
what he'll do next.

420
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:17,480
Which makes me want to tighten the level
of security for you and Jang Ha Na even more.

421
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:20,380
- How would you like to proceed with that?
- No, it's okay.

422
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,200
We've already got a
tight security system in place.

423
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:26,380
Yes, I figured you would already
with your amount of money and power.

424
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,750
But the one I'm really worried about
is Jang Ha Na.

425
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,550
- Where is Jang Ha Na staying right now?
- At my house.

426
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,300
I see... What?

427
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,050
I'm saying, we're living together.

428
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:40,860
Ah... I forgot that you two
had a budding relationship.

429
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,650
Yes, I see.

430
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:44,940
We'll take care of things on our end,
so no need to worry about us.

431
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:47,540
We just won't
step foot out of the house.

432
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,140
Yes.

433
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,140
Yes, I understand.

434
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,480
Are you still asleep?

435
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,860
Are you... not feeling well?

436
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:45,480
I need you to go out to get some
porridge and hot beverages.

437
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:51,040
- Why? Is Ha Na ill?
- She has a fever.

438
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,800
I have all the medication here,
so go out and get some food.

439
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,580
Yes, sir.

440
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,360
You're awake.

441
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:51,480
Are you feeling really sick?
Should I call for a doctor?

442
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:55,380
No, it's okay.
It's just a little exhaustion.

443
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:57,700
Just stay down.

444
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,470
Your temperature isn't too high.

445
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,230
What was it that the doctor
told you?

446
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,640
Keep the body warm
once all the sweat dries off...

447
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:47,020
I've got the warm barley tea
right here...

448
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:57,460
Keep that held in your hands.

449
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,590
I'm sorry.

450
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:10,400
I'm sure you were feeling
just as nervous as I was last night

451
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,460
and I didn't even think about
how it may have affected you.

452
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:18,740
And top of it all... I'm sure you must've
felt quite shocked about Doctor Yoon.

453
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:25,550
I was wrong.
I should've taken care of you better.

454
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:35,930
Eun Chang?
I'm actually glad you called.

455
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:39,430
Starting today, Leader Jang won't be
coming into work for a while.

456
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:44,910
- Yes, it's because of the culprit.
- Hand me the phone.

457
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:50,080
Manage by yourselves at work, and call
Secretary Kwon if you have any problems.

458
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:51,760
Carry on.

459
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:54,350
Director Goo.

460
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:00,170
You can't go into work for a while.
I'm being serious.

461
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:02,370
- Why not?
- Because Lee Soo Hyun....

462
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:06,190
just kidnapped our kidnapper.

463
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:10,660
I've got the house under tight security,
so just stay inside.

464
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,600
There's no need for you to worry.

465
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,360
Get some rest.

466
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:20,760
This is the first time I've taken
any time off in years.

467
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:22,850
And like I said...

468
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:25,600
I want to do the things that
my heart has been wanting to do.

469
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,910
Let's take our time...
and do them all together.

470
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:35,260
By any chance...

471
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:39,540
last night...

472
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:51,650
No, never mind.

473
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:23,400
11:50 PM...

474
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,990
7:40 AM...

475
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:34,220
Almost eight hours...

476
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:45,040
No, I did the right thing.

477
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,720
What I did was right.

478
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,060
Ha Na is sick.

479
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:00,760
Were you not aware that
she's sick?

480
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:04,080
If you had known about it,
then you definitely should've told me.

481
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,570
You know that, don't you?

482
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:08,600
She's sick?

483
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:18,830
- Robin?
- Ha Na!

484
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:23,290
Are you sick?

485
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:26,210
Have you taken any medicine,
or eaten anything?

486
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:30,240
I took some medicine earlier, and had
the porridge Director Goo brought me.

487
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,010
Figures Goo Seo Jin would do this.

488
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:38,320
Just stay in bed, and I'll be right back.

489
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,580
Young Chan, it's me.
Can you go grocery shopping for me?

490
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:58,820
I need beef, abalone, a bottle of red wine...
and all sorts of fresh fruit.

491
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:01,360
Yes, like strawberries.

492
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,580
Okay, thanks.

493
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,880
Robin?

494
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:21,930
What are you doing?

495
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:26,670
Did you see the message that Director Goo
had left for you yesterday?

496
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,820
Rule number one.

497
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:32,820
While you're with me, any mention of Seo Jin,
Goo Seo Jin, Director Goo, or the Director...

498
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:35,430
will not be allowed.

499
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:36,570
Rule number two.

500
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:39,710
The next 12 hours belongs to
me, and me only.

501
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:42,560
I know it's night, but either sleep less,
or take a nap during the day.

502
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,710
I want all your attention during my hours.

503
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:47,020
What else?

504
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:50,440
Don't laugh.
That's rule number three.

505
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:54,070
I still don't agree with what you said.

506
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:57,630
So don't think that
you can just glaze over the issue.

507
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:02,850
Because I'm going to wait
until I get the answer.

508
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:14,970
I'm sorry for having
fallen asleep on you last night.

509
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,410
I know that you came to me last night.

510
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:25,500
And thanks to you, I slept really well.

511
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,500
Then why are you sick?
It upsets me that you're sick.

512
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:34,490
Don't you think it's actually odd
that I haven't even been sick once?

513
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:37,170
Ever since I've been back in Korea

514
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:40,550
I don't think there's been a single
peaceful and uneventful day.

515
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:43,160
I almost died several different times

516
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:48,470
and every one of those times, you
appeared out of nowhere and saved me.

517
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:51,920
So why don't we...

518
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:00,910
both get some rest?

519
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,450
Come with me.

520
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:20,510
- Did you spray something on?
- Huh?

521
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:25,620
- Why do you ask?
- Because you smell like roses.

522
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,470
It's okay.

523
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:10,180
So go on and tell me.

524
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:16,110
My father...
what happened that day...

525
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:18,750
Did you conspire the
kidnapping together?

526
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:21,290
<i>What did you just say?
Say it again.</i>

527
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:24,400
<i>What? Who did you
say was your co-conspirator?</i>

528
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,120
<i>My father is not that
type of a person.</i>

529
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,020
<i>He passed away while
he was on his way to come save me.</i>

530
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:31,060
<i>He's not someone who'd do
such a thing with an asshole like you!</i>

531
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,840
It's okay.

532
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:38,560
I just want the truth.

533
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,070
- No.
- What?

534
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:46,500
- I said, it's not true.
- What's not true?

535
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:56,880
You have to choose your
answer wisely.

536
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,180
Your life isn't the only thing
that's hanging on the line anymore.

537
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,550
I'm being honest, it's not true.

538
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:08,890
Tell me exactly what it is
that you're saying isn't true.

539
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:12,080
- What happened back then...
- Tell me what you're referring to!

540
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,730
I'm saying...

541
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:17,230
that we didn't conspire together.

542
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:23,990
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

543
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:30,400
My father...

544
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:34,560
- had nothing to do with it?
- That's right.

545
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,330
My father...

546
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,330
- wasn't your co-conspirator?
- That's right!

547
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:41,090
My father...

548
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:45,100
- wasn't in on any of it?
- That's right.

549
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,160
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

550
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,050
- Are you sure!
- Yes!

551
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:10,660
That asshole!

552
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:14,660
- A tip?
- He bought medical supplies at a pharmacy.

553
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:16,770
Detectives Kim and Detective Lee
went out to investigate the tip.

554
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:18,800
- To where?
- Gangdong District.

555
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,020
Cotton gauze, and senefol,
which is an antiseptic.

556
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,430
He also bought compression bandages,
and other dressings.

557
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:29,270
- Seeing those purchases...
- It's to treat injuries.

558
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:31,700
- It must be for Jung Man Shik.
- It would seem so.

559
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:34,890
Then it must mean that
he hasn't killed Jung Man Shik.

560
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:38,660
According to Goo Seo Jin,
Lee Soo Hyun is trying to verify something.

561
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:41,190
But what is it that he's trying to verify?

562
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:46,560
- By any chance, was it this guy?
- Yes, this is him.

563
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,030
- This was the guy.
- Are you sure?

564
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:52,030
- Yes, I'm positive.
- Great, thank you.

565
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:06,230
There's no need to be scared.
It's not time for you to die yet.

566
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:11,800
We have...

567
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:15,100
a great deal of things
we've yet to do.

568
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:20,090
- The express bus terminal?
- Yes.

569
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:24,110
He bought a laptop from a express
bus terminal in Sangdo earlier this morning.

570
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:29,540
- The use of his credit card was alerted.
- He's openly using his own credit cards?

571
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:32,550
These are Lee Soo Hyun's known
whereabouts for the past two days.

572
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:36,560
He was spotted at a pharmacy
in Kangdong two days ago.

573
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:39,560
Then he was spotted at an
express bus terminal the next morning.

574
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,250
Then at a convenience store in Ahnsung.

575
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:44,570
Next, at a gas station in Iksan.

576
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:45,950
Then at a restaurant in Daegu.

577
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:51,470
And finally, we traced him at a
convenience store in Busan this morning.

578
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:56,460
As you can see, the path shows
that he's traveling southward.

579
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:59,330
We've been able to trace his path
by his use of his personal credit cards.

580
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:02,930
But I'm sure that he's aware we'd be
able to trace his whereabouts like that.

581
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:04,110
Don't you think that's strange?

582
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:06,160
And why do you think
he's continuing to travel south?

583
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,540
I doubt that he even
has any connections down there.

584
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:11,700
Detective Jang, head down to Busan.
We've already requested for local backup.

585
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:12,890
We'll just have to wait and see.

586
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,440
- Busan?
- Yes.

587
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,980
His last whereabouts were
traced down to Busan.

588
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:22,510
- Can you think of why?
- No, not at all.

589
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,160
- What is all this?
- What do you mean?

590
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,930
- My fridge is filled to the brim.
- Ah, that?

591
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:34,480
Robin asked me to go
grocery shopping for him.

592
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,870
- Why?
- He's actually a pretty good cook.

593
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:41,770
It seems he cooked a huge feast for Ha Na
when he found out that she was feeling ill.

594
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:50,370
Yes, Chairman Goo.
I'm headed over to the house right now.

595
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:54,140
Yes, Director Goo seems to be holding up
much better than we had expected.

596
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:56,820
I'll call you back and
let you know how he's doing.

597
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:11,160
What was that?

598
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:34,310
<i>Let's have dinner.</i>

599
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,600
Have a seat.

600
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:14,020
You're not going to sit down?

601
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,960
Is this... what I think it is?

602
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:28,510
Are you doing this
because of what Robin did?

603
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:31,450
No, it's not like that.

604
00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:34,170
I just thought we could have
dinner together.

605
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:47,530
Secretary Kwon is heading in.

606
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:53,850
You said you felt like
you were dreaming, right?

607
00:55:54,110 --> 00:55:57,950
When you had first
found out about my illness.

608
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:02,320
It's like a dream to me, too.

00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:09,280
The times that I spent with you as Robin
are like dreams that I'm unable to remember.

610
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,750
But you remember those times.

611
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:16,340
You remember the events in my dreams
that I'm unable to remember.

612
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:20,530
I want to remember them with you.

613
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:25,800
- How?
- I want you to tell me about them.

614
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:30,340
The things I say to you
when I'm Robin...

615
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:33,980
and how it is that
I make you laugh and smile.

616
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:36,570
And also, how it is...

617
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:39,890
that I show my love for you.

618
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:03,450
The power must've gone out.

619
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:07,070
Don't worry, it'll be back on soon.

620
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:34,910
You and I...

621
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:38,210
we still have some truths
left to uncover.
