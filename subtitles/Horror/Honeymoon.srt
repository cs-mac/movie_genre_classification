1
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:22,622
I guess I'm
the first one to do this.

2
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,623
Well, I'm not really sure
what I'm supposed to say.

3
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:27,527
I'm now a wife.

4
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:31,030
Okay,
wedding video.

5
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,202
Let me introduce you
to our delicious food.

6
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:39,071
We got veggie korma,

7
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:40,072
lamb curry, samosas.

8
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:43,582
Oh, I am sitting
inside a tent of sorts,

9
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:47,747
because it is inside a tent

10
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:49,268
similar to this one
where you proposed.

11
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:52,718
For our first date,

12
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,787
Bea chose an Indian restaurant,

13
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:58,057
you know, one of
those little places
on Sixth Street

14
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,494
with the colored lights
and the fiber-optic lamps.

15
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:04,597
Yum, except that
halfway through the meal,

16
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:06,832
I start feeling
my stomach gurgle

17
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:09,368
in this horrible
food-poisoning-type way,

18
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,470
and I didn't even
have time to lie to her.

19
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:14,006
I spend 20 minutes
in the dirty
restaurant toilet

20
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:16,842
and the rest of the night
on Bea's bathroom floor,

21
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:19,478
because I couldn't make it
to the subway,

22
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:20,479
let alone Brooklyn.

23
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,647
Well, we'd been planning

24
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:23,482
on going camping upstate
for weeks,

25
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:24,603
but, as you know,
I got sick,

26
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,255
so we couldn't go.

27
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,324
I thought you were upset,

28
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:34,393
because you were
acting really weird,

29
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:36,034
but then you... you built,
like, this tent

30
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:41,267
over our bed out of blankets,

31
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,602
and we made s'mores
on the stove,

32
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,805
and then inside the fort
on our bed,

33
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:47,686
you said, "Bea, this was
supposed to be romantic

34
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,391
"and under the stars,
not sheets,

35
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:57,416
"but you make me the happiest.

36
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,885
Will you marry me?"

37
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:02,655
And now we're married.

38
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:06,525
So this, this is our,
"Fuck you, Indian food."

39
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,199
You tried to keep us apart,

40
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,269
but fuck you.

41
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,571
We win.

42
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:21,941
So we didn't get
a regular wedding cake.

43
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:25,378
We decided on something
that was special
for us instead.

44
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,313
Mm-hmm, special

45
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:28,914
and cheap.
What?

46
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:29,995
No,
I think some people

47
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,752
are annoyed by no cake.

48
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:34,654
Who cares?

49
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,288
It's our wedding,

50
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,690
huh?

51
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,025
Before, I was alone,

52
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,029
but now I'm not.

53
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:55,741
I love you,
honeybee.

54
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:12,324
Whew.

55
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,697
It's not fancy.

56
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:21,200
Is it okay?

57
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,902
Do you like it?

58
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,375
Here's what I see...

59
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,110
<i>ot the city,</i>

60
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:32,545
woods.

61
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,780
Mm-hmm. I just want
it to be perfect.

62
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,382
And I just want to be with you.

63
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,917
Blehh!

64
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:39,685
All right, come on.

65
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:43,222
So this is the famous
family cottage.

66
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,838
Mm.
Wait, wait, wait.

67
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,773
What? What? What? What?
Not so fast, okay?

68
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:02,541
First,
the grand tour.

69
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,977
So this is the living room.

70
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:05,978
Watch your step.

71
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,514
You may notice a slight tilt.

72
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,316
Uh-huh. This is
definitely unsafe.

73
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:11,851
Oh, yeah?
Well, you're unsafe.

74
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:13,786
You're unsafe.
You're unsafe.

75
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:15,187
Here we have a TV
and VCR from 1991.

76
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,393
Uh-huh.

77
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,662
Well, I mean,
who needs cell service

78
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,931
or Internet
when you can keep busy

79
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,212
watching your favorite VHS tape?

80
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:33,539
Over here,
we have the kitchen,

81
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,343
complete with, yes,
a radioactive microwave

82
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:40,779
and an oven that probably
still uses hot coals.

83
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,748
You may be noticing a theme.

84
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:43,749
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

85
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,218
I want to have sex with you.

86
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,653
Bzz. Change is bad.

87
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,290
Looks like a sign.

88
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,359
No, looks like bad wiring.

89
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,660
Yeah.

90
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:55,861
This is the bear room.

91
00:04:58,198 --> 00:04:59,532
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

92
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,233
Very good.
Yeah.

93
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,501
And, uh...

94
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,970
why is it called the bear room?

95
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,005
No.

96
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,441
This is the bathroom.

97
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,277
It's green,

98
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:13,712
very green.

99
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,247
This is, uh...

100
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:18,417
This is where
you almost drowned
playing submarine.

101
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:19,985
Yeah.

102
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,020
Huh.
Yeah.

103
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:22,555
You're my favorite.

104
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:49,081
Which one is ours?

105
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,784
Mm, next door.

106
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,054
The woods room...
Right.

107
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:57,356
Because it has windows

108
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,658
facing...

109
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,293
the woods.

110
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,729
It's dark and scary out there.

111
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,467
It's dark and scary in here.

112
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:42,835
What's with the ducks?

113
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:46,505
Ah, they're fake and hollow,
empty inside.

114
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:49,108
I used to hide things
in 'em with I was little.

115
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,109
Oh?

116
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,443
Yeah.

117
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,345
What are you hiding under here?

118
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,946
My very superspecial
honeymoon nightgown.

119
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:02,922
I love you, honeybee.

120
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,761
Mm, bzz.

121
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:42,461
Hmm.

122
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,763
Sorry.

123
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:45,798
Sorry.

124
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,766
You are pretty creepo.

125
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,536
I was done sleeping.

126
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,171
Look what I found.

127
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,307
Mm.

128
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:03,582
"Dear ducks,

129
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,718
"my name is
Mallard P. Quack.

130
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:08,554
"I am not a real duck.
Stay away.

131
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,956
Quack, quack..."

132
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:14,193
Honk, quack, quack,
quack, honk.

133
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,529
Did we get milk?

134
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:20,933
You put it in here, right?

135
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:22,534
Yeah, no,
it's in the fridge.

136
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:24,870
Now, then... Hey.

137
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,338
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

138
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,706
Hey, wife...

139
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,708
Oh, how gracious
of you, husband.

140
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,977
Mwah.

141
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:34,713
After last night,
you deserve to relax.

142
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:35,714
Mm-hmm.

143
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:38,250
Rest your womb.

144
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,719
What, my womb?

145
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,221
Yeah.

146
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:43,622
Why did you say that?

147
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,792
I don't know.
I don't know. I'm...

148
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,961
I didn't mean anything.

149
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,763
I'm gonna make the pancakes now.

150
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,568
It's just...
What?

151
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,404
Well, I don't know.

152
00:08:58,405 --> 00:08:59,905
Just say it. What?

153
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:00,986
Do you want to have a baby?

154
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,376
Heh. No. What?

155
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,513
No. I don't know
why I said, "Womb."

156
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:09,681
I was...
I was just teasing

157
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:10,762
about how hard
I fucked you.

158
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,852
Okay?

159
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:18,123
Okay.

160
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:32,938
What is it?

161
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,408
I don't know.

162
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:40,045
Okay. Cool.

163
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,581
Wait. I don't know if I'm
ready to have a baby.

164
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,983
I don't know if I'm
ready to have a baby.

165
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,344
We're gonna have
breakfast together

166
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:49,721
every day for the rest
of our lives.

167
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,425
I know. I know.
Hmm.

168
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,861
Which means
we got plenty of time

169
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:58,022
to talk about
your womb and other
married-people things.

170
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,599
Right now,

171
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:04,736
I think we should just
be on our honeymoon.

172
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:05,737
Right?

173
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,339
Right.

174
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,373
Okay.

175
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:10,576
Mm.

176
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:12,177
Pancakes.
♪ Pancakes ♪

177
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,785
You ready?

178
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,720
This thing's massive.

179
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:22,855
Where'd it come from?

180
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:23,889
My dad.

181
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,657
Heh.

182
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:28,861
I didn't realize he
was that kind of hunter.

183
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:30,963
Well, what kind
of hunter is that?

184
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,524
The kind that kills
giant fucking bears.

185
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,200
You ever killed anything?

186
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:39,371
Mm...

187
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:40,506
rats.

188
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:43,208
Yeah, murder by trap
doesn't count.

189
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,576
I mean with your bare hands.

190
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,345
Oh, with my bare hands?

191
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:48,213
Yeah.
Um...

192
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,581
have you?

193
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:52,417
No. No.

194
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,987
I mean, just fish.

195
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,889
Mm, I guess a few frogs.

196
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,056
What?

197
00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,591
Oh, when I was little.

198
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:02,194
We'd use 'em as bait,
like little, mini baby ones.

199
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,096
Oh, right. Mm-hmm.
The little baby ones.

200
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:05,797
Yeah, baby ones.
Is that normal?

201
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:07,966
Oh, they scream
when you cast them.

202
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,368
Oh, my God.

203
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:10,536
Who are you?

204
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:11,904
Eee!

205
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:13,105
Aah!

206
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,071
Come on.

207
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,522
What?

208
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:06,358
What, should we
grab your water wings,
too, Pauly Poo?

209
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:07,759
I'm really not embarrassed

210
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,562
by wanting
a little extra security
on the water.

211
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,598
Here.

212
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:55,674
You tied it,
right?

213
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:57,376
Tied what?
The anchor.

214
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,077
You tied the rope
before you dropped it?

215
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,013
Didn't you just tell me
to drop it in?

216
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,249
You're good at that.

217
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,622
12 years of Girl Scouts.

218
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,290
Last one
in the water's
a rotten egg.

219
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,259
What are you talking about?

220
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,260
Well, if you're afraid,

221
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,664
you can just stay
in the boat like a baby.

222
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,105
I'm not afraid
of the lake.

223
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:22,234
Fine.

224
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:24,336
Hmm.

225
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:25,804
Take off your shirt.

226
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:26,872
All right.

227
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:33,945
No. No, this...

228
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,714
Heh. No.

229
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:37,315
Why not? Come on.
No.

230
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,851
Ah, I'm sorry.
I seem to remember
someone saying,

231
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,953
"Oh, and it's gonna
be just before summer,

232
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:44,690
"so we're totally
gonna have the whole lake
to ourselves,

233
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:46,725
and there'll be
no one around..."

234
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:48,126
Yeah.
And, uh, oh, shit,

235
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,862
yep. No one around.

236
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:52,431
Hello!

237
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:54,433
Yeah, looks like
no one's around.

238
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,902
Yeah, well,
I-I'll take this
under consideration.

239
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:58,637
Okay?

240
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:00,005
What?

241
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,074
Oh, it's so cold.

242
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,575
It's freezing.
Freezing?

243
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,177
I thought
something had snapped...

244
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,145
"Oh, my goodness!"

245
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,780
"Oh, my goodness"?

246
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,584
Oh, my God,
did your womb get cold?

247
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,453
Heh. No,

248
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:17,222
but it did freeze
my big, giant...

249
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:18,523
balls.

250
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,025
No, Paul.

251
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,326
No.
Oh, no.

252
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:22,794
No, no, no.
Oh, no.

253
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,129
No, Paul. No, no.
1...

254
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,331
No, no, no!
2...

255
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,332
3!

256
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,207
Mm.

257
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,176
I really
wanted to go
swimming with you.

258
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,977
I really wanted to go
skinny-dipping with you.

259
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,794
I'm hungry.

260
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:30,428
Oh, weird.

261
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,631
I feel kind of full.

262
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:33,632
You're a dirty girl.

263
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:37,769
You are a dirty girl

264
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,440
who deserves...

265
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,976
to be punished.

266
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:47,813
Paul.
Paul, stop.

267
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:48,914
Stop.

268
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:00,892
This it?

269
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,360
Catchy name.

270
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:05,030
Yeah.
Their specialty is food.

271
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,998
Last one there is a rotten egg.

272
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,870
Fuck.

273
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:20,312
They even open?

274
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,948
They should be.

275
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,589
We're closed.

276
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,825
W-We're closed!

277
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:38,096
Yeah, okay, buddy.
We got it.

278
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:39,531
We're leaving.

279
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,102
Trixie?

280
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,838
Trixie, it's me.

281
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,442
Heh.

282
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:51,443
It's Will.

283
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:54,279
Holy...

284
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:56,748
Will.

285
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:02,053
My God, I haven't
seen you in forever.

286
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,255
Wow.
Uh, yeah.

287
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:04,256
Will.

288
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:07,225
God, you look...

289
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:10,695
<i>Merci. Merci.</i>

290
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,097
This is my... Paul,

291
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,401
my husband Paul.
Hey.

292
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,442
I've been building up
the maple beans
here for years.

293
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,541
When did you start working here?

294
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,244
Uh, actually,
it's my wife,

295
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:29,447
uh, Annie's family's place.

296
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:30,849
Annie's family owns it.

297
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,985
Ah. That's great.

298
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,487
Heh.
Yeah.

299
00:17:37,488 --> 00:17:39,222
Sorry about that before.

300
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:41,860
Mm.

301
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:43,762
Everything's broken around here.

302
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:48,033
Still wearing
this old thing, huh?

303
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:51,036
Oh, yeah, despite
Annie's best efforts.

304
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:54,506
She'll have to pry it
off my cold, dead head.

305
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:58,547
Oh, Will used to be
a great hockey player.

306
00:17:58,644 --> 00:17:59,611
Hey, still am.

307
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:01,252
That's the one with
the ice skates, right?

308
00:18:06,516 --> 00:18:09,556
Well, uh, let me see
if I can rustle us up
some grub.

309
00:18:10,855 --> 00:18:12,089
Annie.

310
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,224
You should leave.

311
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,494
They're leaving.

312
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:23,718
Annie's not feeling so well.

313
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:26,436
Not quite yourself today,
are you, Annie?

314
00:18:29,572 --> 00:18:30,673
Well, let me
go grab those beans,

315
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:34,797
maybe some cheese curds
for old time's sake.

316
00:18:36,114 --> 00:18:39,554
Can't believe you're here.

317
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,157
There's that smile.

318
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:13,418
Your husband is waking up early

319
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:14,986
to catch his wifey
a delicious dinner.

320
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:18,123
Hmm.

321
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,125
Really?

322
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,363
You're not even
gonna question that?

323
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:26,898
No, I... That sounds great.

324
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,301
I was just thinking.

325
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:33,805
About...

326
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:36,274
I don't know.

327
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,477
Nothing.

328
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,280
Your ex-lover.

329
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:43,815
He wa...

330
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:45,376
He was a summer friend
when I was a kid.

331
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:48,286
Heh.

332
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:49,521
Oh, really?

333
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,156
Trixie...

334
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:52,557
a friend?

335
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,933
That woman was just so...

336
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,702
Wait. Are you calling
his wife, "that woman"?

337
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,205
What? She seemed
completely out of it,

338
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,573
like not normal.

339
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,975
Yeah, probably
because that woman
has had enough

340
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:14,345
of the "I can
kill a bear with
my bare hands" bullshit.

341
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:15,814
Well, he's just
a little intense.

342
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:18,716
Yeah, a little intense,
like a fucking maniac.

343
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,718
Hey, in the five minutes
we were there,

344
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,087
he smashed a lamp...

345
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:23,955
Yeah, well, he's not
like that. I know him.

346
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:26,958
And put his wife's arm
in a vise grip.

347
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:30,462
She obviously
did something awful.

348
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:31,930
Are you defending him?

349
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:33,298
Do you miss him?

350
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:36,167
What, just 'cause
he's a little more
alpha than you?

351
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,236
You love him.

352
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,238
Well, I can't help it.

353
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,399
His tiny, sexy,
13-year-old...

354
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:55,787
I'm not like him.

355
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,389
You're not like her.

356
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:04,329
We aren't like them.

357
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,330
I know.

358
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,399
We're the best.

359
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:41,499
Mm.

360
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:44,335
Mm.

361
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,137
Get it.

362
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:52,377
Mm.

363
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,447
Mm.

364
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:01,986
Mm.

365
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:12,063
I'm gonna catch you
a giant fish...

366
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:15,466
with my bare hands.

367
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,100
Shit.

368
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,268
My alarm went off early.

369
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:29,107
The power
must have gone out.

370
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,913
Bea?

371
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:42,020
Are you peeing?

372
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:47,058
Are you ignoring me?

373
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,031
Bea?

374
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:57,735
This isn't funny.

375
00:23:58,504 --> 00:24:00,104
Come on.

376
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:14,852
Fine.

377
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:15,853
Keep hiding.

378
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:18,656
I'm going back to sleep.

379
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:56,027
Bea?

380
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:19,884
Bea?!

381
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:31,195
Bea?

382
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,574
Bea?!

383
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:58,389
Please!

384
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:03,494
This isn't funny!

385
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:06,431
Come on!

386
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,216
Bea?

387
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:38,629
Bea!

388
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:48,372
Bea!

389
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,192
Bea?

390
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:48,666
You okay?

391
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,235
Yeah.

392
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:52,970
What happened?

393
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:56,841
Nothing.
I don't know.

394
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,009
What happened?
Nothing.

395
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,744
I'm okay.

396
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:02,046
Your skin is... is so cold.
I'm fine. I'm okay.

397
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:04,515
You... You feel so...
I'm fine.

398
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,350
I'm fine.

399
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,871
Where's your...
Where's your nightgown?

400
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:10,447
Where's your...
Where's your, uh...

401
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:13,758
Paul, stop.
Come here.

402
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:15,159
Um...
Paul, come here.

403
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,761
I couldn't find you.

404
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:17,795
Come here.
Please come here.

405
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:18,829
Please come here.
Come here.

406
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,830
Okay.

407
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:22,400
Honey, look.

408
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:24,735
I mean,
I'm just cold. Shh.

409
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:26,270
Okay.

410
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:27,705
Okay.

411
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,007
You're okay.

412
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,375
We're okay.
I'm so sorry.

413
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,910
Why? No.
I'm so sorry.

414
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,812
I didn't mean
to scare you. I...

415
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:36,514
I didn't.

416
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:38,482
Um...

417
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:41,252
you... you must
have been, uh...

418
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:43,120
I must be sleepwalking.

419
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:44,622
Sleepwalking. Okay.

420
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:45,890
Mm-hmm.

421
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:47,825
Yeah.

422
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:50,061
Okay. Um...

423
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:54,165
It's okay.

424
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,601
I thought...

425
00:28:58,003 --> 00:29:00,204
I thought... I thought
something bad had...

426
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:13,484
I'm fine.

427
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,191
How's my little zombie face
this morning?

428
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:59,563
I'm serious.

429
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:00,598
I'm fine.

430
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,199
Hmm?
Mm.

431
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,634
What you making?

432
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:05,870
French toast.

433
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:07,271
Oh, good.

434
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:10,474
Obviously not as good
as my pancakes,
but good.

435
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,275
Heh.

436
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:13,844
What's that smell?

437
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:15,746
Whoa.

438
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:16,847
These... These
are burning.

439
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:18,315
What?

440
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,017
This bread isn't battered.

441
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:22,119
What are you talking about?

442
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,487
You forgot to batter the bread.

443
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,756
No, I didn't. It...
Yes, you did.

444
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:27,925
That's the whole point
of... of French toast.

445
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:29,260
You... You batter the bread.

446
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:31,362
All right, you okay here?

447
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:35,566
Yeah. No, I'm f...

448
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:38,102
I'm just feeling a little funny.

449
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:39,103
That's all.

450
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,005
Funny? Like how?

451
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,506
I don't know.

452
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,608
We should go into town.
No, no, I'm fine.

453
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:46,777
Gotta be, like, a doctor
or something or...
No, don't be crazy.

454
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:48,312
We've spent hundreds
of nights together,

455
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:49,814
and you've never
been a sleepwalker.

456
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:51,215
I'm just tired.

457
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:53,884
You've never forgotten
how to make French toast.

458
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:55,553
I promise.

459
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:57,555
I promise.

460
00:30:57,556 --> 00:30:58,689
Mm.

461
00:31:01,827 --> 00:31:03,561
Okay.

462
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:07,264
So...

463
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:09,667
bit of milk.

464
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:10,868
That's an egg.

465
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:13,404
Shut up.

466
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:14,405
Now for the cinnamon...

467
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,674
Okay, I got it.
I got it.

468
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:17,675
Okay.
Got it.

469
00:31:17,676 --> 00:31:19,043
Well, I made the coffee.

470
00:31:20,946 --> 00:31:21,979
Oh.

471
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,748
Well, I thought today, maybe,

472
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:26,584
if you're up for it,
we could go out onto the...

473
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:27,585
What is it?

474
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:28,986
What is it?

475
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:04,121
What are you doing?

476
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:06,423
Look at this fatty one.

477
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:12,396
Oh. Oh.

478
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:15,399
This big, fatty one
is gonna be our dinner.

479
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:18,335
Why aren't you laughing?

480
00:32:19,805 --> 00:32:21,405
I don't know.

481
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:24,408
You want to go back?

482
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:27,578
No. No.

483
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:39,089
Thought you would
find that funny,

484
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,357
as a frog killer.

485
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,494
Hey.

486
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:45,863
Froggy Krueger.

487
00:32:45,864 --> 00:32:47,731
Yo.

488
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,744
Let's go swimming.

489
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:02,413
Heh.

490
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:03,414
That's funny.

491
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:04,515
You're funny.

492
00:33:04,516 --> 00:33:06,717
Last one in's a rotten egg!

493
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:30,107
How's it going?

494
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,010
How's it going with you?

495
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:37,948
Did you rinse off all
the creepy-crawlies?

496
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:48,225
Why'd you do that?

497
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:50,227
You knew the water was cold.

498
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:52,563
I don't know.

499
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:53,664
I thought it'd be funny.

500
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:15,686
I'm sorry.

501
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:17,855
What's going on with you?

502
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:19,456
I'm tired.

503
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:21,926
The drive, the wedding,

504
00:34:21,927 --> 00:34:25,262
stress of everything
is catching up to me.

505
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:27,064
The wedding?

506
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,466
Oh, I... No,
I was just saying...

507
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:31,468
You wanted to get married.

508
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:34,171
Yeah. Yes. Yes.

509
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:35,673
That's all I want.

510
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:37,741
I just want to make you happy.

511
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,276
You do.

512
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:40,978
I promise.

513
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:01,498
Paul.

514
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:06,403
Paul.

515
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:07,771
Paul.
What's this?

516
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,907
What?
What are these?

517
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:11,408
What is this?

518
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:12,509
Bea.

519
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,944
Jesus.
They're mosquito bites.

520
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,413
I know what a fucking
mosquito bite looks like.

521
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:17,494
W-Way to get me
in the mood.

522
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:19,883
Okay.

523
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:21,986
Okay, I just...

524
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:29,560
Do you think something
maybe bit you

525
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:30,928
when you were sleepwalking?

526
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:33,330
Yeah. Yeah, no,
I think you're right.

527
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:34,598
I think something bit me.

528
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:37,368
You do?
Yes, mosquitoes.

529
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:38,435
Don't get upset.
I'm worried.

530
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:39,670
I'm tired, okay?

531
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:41,872
I think I'm just
gonna go take a sleep.

532
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:42,740
What?

533
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:44,908
I'm just gonna go take a nap.

534
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:00,310
Bea.

535
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:08,986
I think... Oh, I...

536
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,728
I kind of have a headache.

537
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,925
Oh, I feel like we should...

538
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,928
I feel like
we should get
a good night's sleep.

539
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:22,132
I'm just not really in the mood.

540
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:26,303
Oh, I don't know.
I took some Advil,

541
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,940
but this hea...

542
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:31,208
I don't know.

543
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:35,179
I don't know.
I took some Tylenol,

544
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,460
but this headache won't go away.

545
00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:39,216
I can't help it.

546
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:43,020
My tummy hurts.

547
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:47,337
My stomach just feels icky.

548
00:38:50,195 --> 00:38:51,195
Icky.

549
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:54,364
Icky.

550
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:07,277
Hey there.

551
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:08,278
Hey.

552
00:40:23,388 --> 00:40:25,055
Trade you.

553
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,294
Two of a kind.

554
00:40:30,295 --> 00:40:31,929
Some people
might call it a pair.

555
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:41,772
Hmm. Small straight.

556
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:42,973
I'll take that as my Chance.

557
00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:46,343
You're my chance.

558
00:40:53,251 --> 00:40:54,251
I want to kiss you.

559
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:57,220
I want to kiss you.

560
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,590
You're gonna kill me.

561
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:29,453
Mm.

562
00:41:30,455 --> 00:41:32,489
What? What is it?

563
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,492
Oh, I kind of have a headache.

564
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,094
Oh, I took some Tylenol,

565
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:39,296
but this headache won't go away.

566
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:49,072
Are you mad?

567
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:50,107
No.

568
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:55,312
No.

569
00:42:00,752 --> 00:42:02,319
Are you trying
to not have sex with me?

570
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:06,723
What?

571
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:10,060
Are you avoiding
sleeping with me?

572
00:42:10,061 --> 00:42:11,395
You're acting crazy.

573
00:42:11,396 --> 00:42:12,462
I'm your husband.

574
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:14,898
And I'm your wife.

575
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:16,466
We talk to each other.

576
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:17,467
I know that.

577
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:18,735
You can tell me if...

578
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:19,736
My head hurts.

579
00:42:20,438 --> 00:42:22,873
Did something happen
in the woods?

580
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:26,543
I was sleepwalking.

581
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:29,713
You feel distant.

582
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,616
Y-You feel
different.

583
00:42:34,986 --> 00:42:36,586
You feel distracted.

584
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:55,472
Bea.

585
00:42:55,473 --> 00:42:57,074
Bea.

586
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:59,076
I want to make you happy.

587
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:06,383
Put on your nightgown.

588
00:43:06,384 --> 00:43:07,664
What? What are
you talking about?

589
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:10,333
Your special
honeymoon nightgown.

590
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:14,858
Why?

591
00:43:14,859 --> 00:43:16,827
I want to see it on you.

592
00:43:16,828 --> 00:43:18,361
Come on. Put it on.

593
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:19,362
No.

594
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:20,363
Why not?

595
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:22,966
Are you really
doing this right now?

596
00:43:25,236 --> 00:43:26,303
It looks sexy.

597
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:29,773
No, I can't.

598
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:31,041
Why not?

599
00:43:31,042 --> 00:43:32,442
I put it away.

600
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:35,812
It's put away
with my dirty laundry.

601
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:38,014
It's in the box,
the clothes bo...

602
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:39,983
the suitcase.
It's in the suitcase.

603
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:42,519
It's in the suitcase
with my dirty laundry.

604
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:48,558
What, do you really
want me to go get it?

605
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,698
No.

606
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:16,213
Where'd you go?

607
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:20,116
I was getting a drink.

608
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:33,029
Are you staying there?

609
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,364
Where's your glass?

610
00:48:27,138 --> 00:48:28,772
What are you doing?

611
00:48:28,773 --> 00:48:29,773
Went outside.

612
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:32,108
You can't do that.

613
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:33,309
We're in the middle of nowhere.

614
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:34,244
You don't know what's out there.

615
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:35,311
Someone was out there.

616
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:37,747
What are you talking about?

617
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:41,384
Looking in our windows,
playing some
little game,

618
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:42,952
shining some
high-beam flashlight

619
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:44,120
in your face while you sleep.

620
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:46,656
No.
Yes.

621
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:48,158
Yes.

622
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:50,693
I took a walk
in the woods earlier.

623
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:53,430
What does that have
to do with anything?

624
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:55,265
Where you were sleepwalking.

625
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:57,400
Why would you go ba...

626
00:48:57,401 --> 00:48:58,401
Why are you lying to me?

627
00:49:01,372 --> 00:49:03,773
I was sleepwalking.

628
00:49:05,376 --> 00:49:06,976
I'm confused.

629
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:09,345
I found footprints.

630
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:11,147
It was muddy.

631
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:12,348
They weren't ours.

632
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:14,284
I know someone was
in the woods with you,

633
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:17,220
and I know someone
was just outside,
looking in our windows.

634
00:49:17,221 --> 00:49:18,221
No.

635
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:20,924
This is me standing here.

636
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:24,961
Okay? It's me.

637
00:49:26,664 --> 00:49:27,831
I love you.

638
00:49:29,567 --> 00:49:31,234
I love you so much,

639
00:49:33,504 --> 00:49:34,824
but I... I need you
to talk to me.

640
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,874
Did you meet him?

641
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:42,545
What?

642
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,582
Who?

643
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:46,883
Will.

644
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:49,452
What?

645
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:51,020
I just want to know
what happened.

646
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:52,388
I just want you to tell me...

647
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:54,157
What do you want me to tell you?

648
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:55,992
I get it.
Maybe he wanted to meet,

649
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:59,062
and y-you just thought,
you know, like... like,
you were kids again.

650
00:50:00,264 --> 00:50:02,232
Please, I know
it's not your fault.

651
00:50:02,233 --> 00:50:03,867
I saw him yelling at his wife.

652
00:50:03,868 --> 00:50:05,835
I saw the way he looked at you.

653
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,437
You don't know what
you're talking about.

654
00:50:07,438 --> 00:50:08,872
Did he do something to you?

655
00:50:08,873 --> 00:50:09,672
Stop it.

656
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:10,907
Did he hurt you?
Stop it.

657
00:50:10,908 --> 00:50:11,908
I'm worried.

658
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:12,909
You're acting crazy.

659
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:14,110
Why are you doing this?

660
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:15,245
Because I want to protect you.

661
00:50:15,246 --> 00:50:16,246
It wasn't Will!

662
00:50:16,247 --> 00:50:17,547
Okay?! You have to stop!

663
00:50:17,548 --> 00:50:19,282
He was looking in our windows!

664
00:50:19,283 --> 00:50:21,417
You probably saw a boat
or the moon.

665
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:23,653
It wasn't the fucking moon!

666
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:29,993
You have to stop.

667
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:37,133
You're ruining this.

668
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:40,069
You're ruining
our time together.

669
00:52:22,706 --> 00:52:24,741
Morning.

670
00:52:24,742 --> 00:52:25,908
Morning.

671
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:27,977
What are you doing?

672
00:52:30,047 --> 00:52:32,482
What is this?

673
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:35,785
Nothing.

674
00:52:41,225 --> 00:52:42,265
Doesn't look like nothing.

675
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:49,365
What are you doing?

676
00:52:50,801 --> 00:52:53,002
Nothing.

677
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,003
You want some help?

678
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:58,641
No, I got it.

679
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:26,302
Why do you do that?

680
00:53:27,271 --> 00:53:29,005
I don't know.

681
00:53:30,674 --> 00:53:33,042
They're just ants.

682
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:36,479
How are the bug bites?

683
00:53:38,015 --> 00:53:40,049
Fine.

684
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,150
Better.

685
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:42,151
They don't look better.

686
00:53:43,454 --> 00:53:45,088
They look worse.

687
00:53:45,089 --> 00:53:47,123
Not really like bug bites
at all, in fact.

688
00:53:50,127 --> 00:53:51,394
I was just trying to be nice.

689
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:48,785
Hi.

690
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:50,887
Hi.

691
00:55:14,912 --> 00:55:18,648
They can live for up
to five minutes underwater.

692
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:43,940
I want to leave.

693
00:55:43,941 --> 00:55:45,074
What are you talking about?

694
00:55:45,976 --> 00:55:48,477
I want us to leave,

695
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:52,774
for us to get out of here
and go back to the city.

696
00:55:53,884 --> 00:55:54,884
We're on our honeymoon.

697
00:55:56,053 --> 00:55:59,088
Why would you say that?
Why would you say that?

698
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:00,556
Nothing's feeling right
out here.

699
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:02,658
Everything feels different.

700
00:56:09,433 --> 00:56:10,967
I don't want to fight.

701
00:56:10,968 --> 00:56:13,202
I don't want to fight
with you. I just...

702
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:16,439
Last night was horrible.
Today was horrible.

703
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,609
I don't want to sleep
without you ever again.

704
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:21,344
I don't want to either.

705
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,350
I need you.

706
00:56:27,351 --> 00:56:29,685
I miss you.

707
00:56:29,686 --> 00:56:31,120
Miss you.

708
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:48,604
Paul.

709
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,378
I'm fine.

710
00:57:01,051 --> 00:57:04,253
This is a lot of blood.
This isn't normal.

711
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:05,421
We need a doctor.

712
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,857
I'm not going
to the doctor
for my period.

713
00:57:07,858 --> 00:57:09,592
That's not what this is.

714
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:11,694
It's not?
No.

715
00:57:11,695 --> 00:57:14,830
I sat there while you
marked the calendar

716
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:16,332
and counted the days

717
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:19,535
so we didn't have
to deal with it now.

718
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:21,437
Enough of this.

719
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,639
O-Of what? Of me?

720
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,641
Y-You've got bruises
on your thighs.

721
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:27,122
You're bleeding.
Why are you bleeding?

722
00:57:28,478 --> 00:57:30,546
We're not staying here.

723
00:57:31,848 --> 00:57:33,582
Paul, please calm down,
okay?

724
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:34,784
Pack... Pack your bags.

725
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:37,119
When I come back,
we're leaving, okay?

726
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,654
We're gonna get you help.

727
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:40,156
Where are you going?

728
00:57:40,157 --> 00:57:42,491
I can't help you
if I don't know
what happened.

729
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:45,661
Okay?

730
00:57:47,097 --> 00:57:49,265
If you won't tell me,

731
00:57:49,266 --> 00:57:51,033
I'll ask him.

732
00:57:51,034 --> 00:57:52,268
Paul.

733
00:57:52,269 --> 00:57:54,003
Paul!

734
00:57:54,004 --> 00:57:55,004
Paul!

735
00:58:08,452 --> 00:58:10,412
Excuse me. Hi.
I was... I was here
the other night.

736
00:58:12,556 --> 00:58:13,789
My wife knows your husband.

737
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:15,491
I-I'm sorry.

738
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:16,892
Are you okay?

739
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:18,361
Let me help you.

740
00:58:18,362 --> 00:58:19,996
My name is Annie.

741
00:58:21,365 --> 00:58:22,365
Right. I-I'm Paul.

742
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:24,900
My husband is Will.

743
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:27,770
Yeah. I-Is he around?

744
00:58:27,771 --> 00:58:28,771
Can you get him for me?

745
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:31,707
Will's not here.

746
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:35,511
Where is he?

747
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:37,847
He's hiding.

748
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:47,376
What happened...
happened to your legs?

749
00:58:48,825 --> 00:58:50,385
How did you
get those marks
on your legs?

750
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,096
Did he do this to you?

751
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:55,931
You should stay away from us.

752
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:57,733
I can help you.

753
00:58:57,734 --> 00:58:59,068
We're not safe.

754
00:58:59,069 --> 00:59:03,105
We will hurt you.

755
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:06,202
Hello.

756
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:13,209
Hello?

757
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:21,664
Paul.

758
01:03:21,665 --> 01:03:23,399
Paul.

759
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,501
Paul.

760
01:03:25,502 --> 01:03:26,902
Paul. Paul,
what are you do...

761
01:03:29,572 --> 01:03:30,572
What the...

762
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:33,642
What the fuck is going on?

763
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:36,011
Mm.

764
01:03:36,012 --> 01:03:37,980
Who are you?

765
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:38,981
What? Paul...

766
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:41,050
Who are you?

767
01:03:41,051 --> 01:03:42,885
What are you talking about?

768
01:03:42,886 --> 01:03:44,753
Answer me.

769
01:03:44,754 --> 01:03:45,821
Please.

770
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:46,822
Who are you?

771
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:49,024
Who are...
Bea.

772
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,261
My name is Bea.

773
01:03:52,262 --> 01:03:53,796
Okay?
You know that.

774
01:03:53,797 --> 01:03:55,297
Who am I?

775
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:56,732
What?
You're the...

776
01:03:56,733 --> 01:03:58,233
Who am I?

777
01:03:58,234 --> 01:03:59,568
My husband.

778
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:02,338
You are my husband.

779
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:04,440
What's my name?

780
01:04:04,441 --> 01:04:06,842
Go on.
You just said it.

781
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,181
My husband is Paul.

782
01:04:15,719 --> 01:04:16,785
Go on.

783
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:18,754
My home is New York.

784
01:04:18,755 --> 01:04:20,089
I live in Brooklyn.

785
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:23,359
448 Kent Street,
Apartment 3B.

786
01:04:27,497 --> 01:04:28,777
My birthday is January 25, 1987.

787
01:04:32,769 --> 01:04:34,370
My favorite color is blue.

788
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,474
I'm allergic
to hazelnuts.
"Hazelnuts.

789
01:04:38,475 --> 01:04:39,775
"I don't like..."
I don't like...

790
01:04:39,776 --> 01:04:41,610
"the taste of ketchup."
the taste of ketchup.

791
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:43,746
Why are you writing
these things?

792
01:04:43,747 --> 01:04:45,147
These aren't things
you memorize.

793
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:49,818
This is you.

794
01:04:49,819 --> 01:04:51,620
This is Bea.

795
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:53,155
Why are you writing
these things?

796
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:57,593
I don't know.
I don't know.

797
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:00,396
Talked to Will's wife.

798
01:05:02,432 --> 01:05:04,400
What?
It's the same thing as this,

799
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:05,961
the same thing as this,
page after page.

800
01:05:08,338 --> 01:05:09,605
"My name is Annie.

801
01:05:09,606 --> 01:05:12,441
My husband is Will.
This is my home."

802
01:05:12,442 --> 01:05:14,710
Why are you writing
these things?

803
01:05:14,711 --> 01:05:16,145
Please. Please.

804
01:05:16,146 --> 01:05:18,580
Why are you doing the same thing

805
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,582
as a woman you barely know?

806
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,317
Please. Please, stop.
Why do you have...

807
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:24,086
Why do you have
the same marks...

808
01:05:24,087 --> 01:05:25,487
Stop. Stop.
On your legs?

809
01:05:25,488 --> 01:05:26,955
Stop it.
I just... Stop it.

810
01:05:26,956 --> 01:05:29,076
Why are you both waking up
in the middle of the night?

811
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:31,226
Who's out there?

812
01:05:33,863 --> 01:05:35,230
Who is shining the light?

813
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,431
Why did you
go back there? Why?

814
01:05:38,902 --> 01:05:40,002
It wasn't Will.

815
01:05:40,003 --> 01:05:41,203
There was blood on Will's hat.

816
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:44,439
There was blood on Will's hat.

817
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:49,278
Yeah.

818
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:50,946
What happened to him?

819
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:52,147
What did she do to him?

820
01:05:52,148 --> 01:05:53,949
Stop it.

821
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,751
What are you gonna do to me?

822
01:05:55,752 --> 01:05:56,819
I want to protect you.

823
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:11,500
Where are the car keys?

824
01:06:12,268 --> 01:06:14,970
Where...

825
01:06:16,606 --> 01:06:18,974
Where did you put the key?

826
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:35,290
Where are the keys?!

827
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:38,327
Open up.

828
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:42,464
Open up.

829
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:49,404
Open up, Bea!

830
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,351
Bea.

831
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,053
Go back to the bedroom.
Bea, honeybee.

832
01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:07,356
You have to to back
to the bedroom.
What are you doing?

833
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:08,657
Go back to the bedroom.
You're bleeding.

834
01:07:08,658 --> 01:07:10,325
Listen to me.
What are you doing?

835
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:12,327
Listen. Please don't
do this to me now.
You're bleeding.

836
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:13,562
Go back to the bedroom!

837
01:07:13,563 --> 01:07:15,163
Why are you yelling?!
Okay. Okay.

838
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:16,632
We'll go back together.

839
01:07:16,633 --> 01:07:18,267
What are you talking about?
We'll go back together.

840
01:07:18,268 --> 01:07:19,535
Stop it! Stop it!
Go back to the bedroom.

841
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:20,903
Stop saying that!

842
01:07:20,904 --> 01:07:22,871
Tell me what's going on!
I don't want to.

843
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:25,173
I don't want to.
Tell me what's going on!

844
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:26,642
Talk to me!

845
01:07:26,643 --> 01:07:27,676
Stop!

846
01:07:27,677 --> 01:07:28,477
Bea!

847
01:07:28,478 --> 01:07:29,611
Please come here.

848
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:31,313
Get up!
Please come here.

849
01:07:31,314 --> 01:07:32,814
Tell me what's going on!

850
01:07:34,684 --> 01:07:36,051
Tell me what's going on.

851
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:37,819
Tell me what's going on.

852
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:41,790
Tell me what's going on.

853
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:42,624
Why are you...

854
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:44,560
Why are you hurting yourself?

855
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:45,594
You're scaring me.

856
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:48,931
I love you.

857
01:07:50,033 --> 01:07:51,066
I love you,
honeybee.

858
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:54,536
I love you,
honeybee.

859
01:07:56,639 --> 01:07:58,106
I love you,
honeybee.

860
01:07:58,107 --> 01:07:59,207
What do you say?

861
01:07:59,208 --> 01:08:00,842
Answer me.

862
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:03,512
I say that, and then
what do you say?

863
01:08:03,513 --> 01:08:05,981
We don't remember.

864
01:08:05,982 --> 01:08:07,115
We don't remember.

865
01:08:07,116 --> 01:08:08,450
Why are you saying that?

866
01:08:08,451 --> 01:08:09,952
We don't remember what to say.

867
01:08:09,953 --> 01:08:12,354
Why are you saying that?
What are you
talking about?

868
01:08:12,355 --> 01:08:13,455
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

869
01:08:13,456 --> 01:08:14,456
What are you talking about?

870
01:08:14,457 --> 01:08:15,991
I'm sorry.

871
01:08:15,992 --> 01:08:18,860
No! No!
Oh, fuck.

872
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:20,295
No. Paul!

873
01:08:20,296 --> 01:08:21,897
Paul, no!

874
01:08:21,898 --> 01:08:23,699
Oh, Paul!

875
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,300
What are you doing?
What are you...

876
01:08:25,301 --> 01:08:26,468
Stop.
Talk to me!

877
01:08:26,469 --> 01:08:27,636
Stop it!
Talk to me!

878
01:08:27,637 --> 01:08:28,637
Stop it!

879
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:31,607
Don't...
What are you...

880
01:08:34,344 --> 01:08:35,277
Bea!

881
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:37,779
No! No.

882
01:08:40,350 --> 01:08:42,284
No!
Untie me!

883
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:43,852
What are you doing?

884
01:08:43,853 --> 01:08:44,886
Let me go!

885
01:08:46,556 --> 01:08:47,889
Stop it.

886
01:08:49,325 --> 01:08:51,093
Stop. What are you doing?

887
01:08:51,094 --> 01:08:52,494
Hold... Stop it!
Stop it!

888
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:54,062
Stop it.
Paul!

889
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:01,870
Paul! Stop!

890
01:09:08,711 --> 01:09:09,978
Oh, God.

891
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:22,124
I don't know...

892
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:23,525
I don't know
what's happening
to you.

893
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:28,063
I just want things to be normal.

894
01:09:30,433 --> 01:09:33,035
I just want us to be us.

895
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:40,575
I just want us to be us.

896
01:09:57,827 --> 01:10:00,696
Why... Why aren't
you crying?

897
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,500
My wife cries.

898
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:12,060
Then if I cry,
will you let me go?

899
01:10:13,176 --> 01:10:15,477
My wife doesn't act like this.

900
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:20,315
She tells me everything.

901
01:10:22,285 --> 01:10:25,253
She tells me the truth.

902
01:10:36,466 --> 01:10:38,533
Where is my wife?

903
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:48,410
I need her.

904
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:51,613
It's me.

905
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:54,349
I need her back.

906
01:10:59,789 --> 01:11:01,123
Wait.

907
01:11:12,335 --> 01:11:14,770
I am your wife.

908
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:17,272
How do I know that?

909
01:11:22,912 --> 01:11:25,781
How do you not know that?

910
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:41,282
Where did we go
on our first date?

911
01:11:42,899 --> 01:11:43,965
I can't.

912
01:11:45,368 --> 01:11:46,501
Please.

913
01:11:46,502 --> 01:11:47,769
I... I don't...

914
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:49,404
Why not?
Why can't you
remember this?

915
01:11:49,405 --> 01:11:50,939
I don't know.

916
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:53,108
I don't know.
I don't know.

917
01:11:53,109 --> 01:11:55,944
We ate it, we... we had it
at the wedding.

918
01:11:55,945 --> 01:11:57,345
We ate it, we had it
at the wedding.

919
01:12:00,116 --> 01:12:01,683
Four days ago.

920
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:04,586
I'm sorry.

921
01:12:04,587 --> 01:12:05,587
I don't know.

922
01:12:06,255 --> 01:12:08,456
How did I ask you to marry me?

923
01:12:14,697 --> 01:12:16,331
Where did I propose?

924
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,099
Huh?

925
01:12:22,538 --> 01:12:25,106
Where did I propose?

926
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:31,813
Camping.

927
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:32,981
Tell me.

928
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:35,951
We went camping.

929
01:12:37,153 --> 01:12:39,287
We made s'mores.

930
01:12:41,924 --> 01:12:44,826
Oh, and there were
so many stars.

931
01:12:44,827 --> 01:12:46,862
We snuggled into our tent,

932
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:49,130
and you said to me...
you said,

933
01:12:49,131 --> 01:12:52,367
"You make me the happiest.
Will you marry me?"

934
01:12:53,302 --> 01:12:55,770
That's right, right?

935
01:12:58,341 --> 01:12:59,741
Am I right?

936
01:13:01,277 --> 01:13:03,778
But I... I remember.

937
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:05,780
It was so quiet and cold,

938
01:13:05,781 --> 01:13:07,883
and there were so many stars.

939
01:13:07,884 --> 01:13:08,884
No.

940
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:09,918
No.
That's what happened.

941
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,255
No.

942
01:13:13,256 --> 01:13:16,091
You were sick.

943
01:13:16,092 --> 01:13:17,359
No.

944
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:18,627
We were on our bed.

945
01:13:18,628 --> 01:13:19,895
I remember a tent.

946
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:21,763
I made a tent on our bed.

947
01:13:21,764 --> 01:13:22,924
No, I... I remember
the stars.

948
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:25,834
What happened to Bea?

949
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:31,172
No, Paul, I knew...
I know it was on our bed.

950
01:13:31,173 --> 01:13:32,240
Where is she?

951
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,576
Okay, Paul, please,
I knew that's how...

952
01:13:34,577 --> 01:13:36,745
Where is Bea?
It's me.

953
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:37,846
Where is my wife?

954
01:13:37,847 --> 01:13:39,514
Stop saying that.

955
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:41,016
Stop saying that.

956
01:13:41,017 --> 01:13:42,317
What has happened?

957
01:13:43,786 --> 01:13:46,521
You look like her,
but you're not her.

958
01:13:46,522 --> 01:13:48,490
Please. I just forgot.

959
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:56,264
You have her toes.

960
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:58,333
You have her toes.

961
01:14:10,212 --> 01:14:11,479
You have her knees.

962
01:14:18,487 --> 01:14:19,754
You have her thighs.

963
01:14:20,756 --> 01:14:22,457
It's me.

964
01:14:26,362 --> 01:14:28,196
You smell the same.

965
01:14:36,505 --> 01:14:38,873
You taste the same.

966
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:47,148
But you're different.
You're different.

967
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:49,484
No.

968
01:14:54,924 --> 01:14:55,924
How does this feel?

969
01:14:57,259 --> 01:14:59,027
What does this feel like to you?

970
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:03,898
It's me.

971
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:06,267
Please.

972
01:15:22,551 --> 01:15:24,119
Please, help me.

973
01:15:25,388 --> 01:15:27,322
Help me.

974
01:15:28,324 --> 01:15:29,657
Take it out, please.

975
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,360
Take it out.

976
01:15:52,782 --> 01:15:53,782
Don't stop. Don't stop.

977
01:15:56,318 --> 01:15:57,819
Don't stop.

978
01:16:12,368 --> 01:16:14,669
Paul, please.

979
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:16,871
Please.

980
01:16:26,782 --> 01:16:27,782
What is this?

981
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:31,086
Eh, what is this?

982
01:16:32,721 --> 01:16:33,888
I couldn't tell you.

983
01:16:33,889 --> 01:16:35,924
I couldn't.

984
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:37,826
What is this?
I'm sorry.

985
01:16:37,827 --> 01:16:38,827
Oh, fuck.

986
01:16:38,828 --> 01:16:39,894
Paul.
Oh, fuck.

987
01:16:39,895 --> 01:16:41,696
That's it.
Paul.

988
01:16:41,697 --> 01:16:43,531
This is...
Paul!

989
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,469
What is...

990
01:16:53,776 --> 01:16:56,611
Something bad happened to me.

991
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:07,555
Something bad
happened to me
in the woods.

992
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:10,925
There was a light.

993
01:17:13,162 --> 01:17:14,996
I couldn't see, but...

994
01:17:17,566 --> 01:17:19,100
I could only see their dark,

995
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:22,930
the outlines of their bodies,

996
01:17:25,608 --> 01:17:26,608
their dark bodies.

997
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:29,911
They went inside me.

998
01:17:35,718 --> 01:17:38,052
And then they left, but...

999
01:17:38,053 --> 01:17:39,173
I couldn't see them anymore,

1000
01:17:40,756 --> 01:17:41,956
but I could still feel them...

1001
01:17:43,559 --> 01:17:44,592
inside.

1002
01:17:47,796 --> 01:17:49,864
I, uh...

1003
01:17:49,865 --> 01:17:52,400
I can still feel them inside.

1004
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:55,737
They're with me,

1005
01:17:57,606 --> 01:18:00,141
and I know what they know,

1006
01:18:00,142 --> 01:18:03,044
and I know what they want,

1007
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:04,779
and I know what I'm
supposed to do.

1008
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:08,416
I don't understand
what you mean.

1009
01:18:10,219 --> 01:18:11,953
I... I wanted to tell you.

1010
01:18:11,954 --> 01:18:14,222
I wanted, but...

1011
01:18:14,223 --> 01:18:15,223
I'm not allowed.

1012
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:18,126
I knew it was happening,

1013
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:21,663
and there was
nothing I could do,

1014
01:18:21,664 --> 01:18:23,198
but I just wanted time.

1015
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:24,519
I just wanted
these last few days.

1016
01:18:27,636 --> 01:18:28,903
What are you saying?

1017
01:18:28,904 --> 01:18:30,024
I just wanted our honeymoon.

1018
01:18:30,739 --> 01:18:33,441
My body is here,
but I'm leaving.

1019
01:18:36,779 --> 01:18:39,214
They're taking everything.

1020
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:40,335
They're...
they're taking me.

1021
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:43,117
Bea. They're taking Bea.

1022
01:18:47,656 --> 01:18:48,990
No, they're not.

1023
01:18:48,991 --> 01:18:51,025
We need to get help.

1024
01:18:51,026 --> 01:18:52,026
No. No.
We need to leave.

1025
01:18:52,027 --> 01:18:53,461
Where did you put the keys?

1026
01:18:53,462 --> 01:18:55,463
No. No, you can't leave.
Where are the keys?

1027
01:18:55,464 --> 01:18:57,131
Where are the keys?
You don't understand.

1028
01:18:57,132 --> 01:18:58,399
Where are the keys?
Okay, you don't understand.

1029
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,168
Where are the keys?
You can't leave.

1030
01:19:00,169 --> 01:19:02,270
Where did you put the keys?
Paul, you can't leave.

1031
01:19:02,271 --> 01:19:03,805
Where did you put the keys?
You can't leave.

1032
01:19:03,806 --> 01:19:05,640
You are sick. We need to leave.
We can't leave.

1033
01:19:05,641 --> 01:19:06,608
We need to go.
No. No.

1034
01:19:06,609 --> 01:19:08,977
No, no, no, no.
No, I remember now.

1035
01:19:08,978 --> 01:19:10,378
I remember.
I couldn't before,

1036
01:19:10,379 --> 01:19:13,348
but now I remember.
We went for Indian food.

1037
01:19:13,349 --> 01:19:15,683
That was our first date.
We're okay.

1038
01:19:15,684 --> 01:19:16,884
We're okay.
Stop.

1039
01:19:16,885 --> 01:19:18,286
We're not, okay?

1040
01:19:18,287 --> 01:19:20,521
No.
This is not okay.

1041
01:19:20,522 --> 01:19:22,156
No. Look, we can...

1042
01:19:22,157 --> 01:19:24,892
We can watch.
We can watch on the video.

1043
01:19:24,893 --> 01:19:26,094
We can watch it on the video.

1044
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:27,328
We have to fix this.

1045
01:19:27,329 --> 01:19:29,631
We can watch it on the video.

1046
01:19:29,632 --> 01:19:30,498
We can watch it.

1047
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:32,033
I just want to make things okay.

1048
01:19:32,034 --> 01:19:33,534
No, you can't.
Why not?

1049
01:19:33,535 --> 01:19:35,737
It'll be all right.
And please just
stay with me.

1050
01:19:35,738 --> 01:19:37,171
Just stay with me.
What? No.

1051
01:19:37,172 --> 01:19:39,540
I just want
to be with you.
I want to be with you.

1052
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:41,209
We can't stay here
with you like this.

1053
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:42,210
No. No.
I'm leaving.

1054
01:19:42,211 --> 01:19:43,578
I'm getting help.

1055
01:19:43,579 --> 01:19:45,780
You can't.
You can't.
No, you can't.

1056
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:46,781
No, we know.

1057
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:48,116
You know what we told you.

1058
01:19:50,085 --> 01:19:51,085
We don't need you.

1059
01:19:53,222 --> 01:19:55,556
You don't have any more time.

1060
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:01,296
They're gonna get rid of you.

1061
01:20:07,169 --> 01:20:08,369
They're...

1062
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:09,704
No, I have to hide you.

1063
01:20:11,707 --> 01:20:13,508
I have to hide you.

1064
01:20:13,509 --> 01:20:15,143
I have to hide you
where we won't find you.

1065
01:20:15,144 --> 01:20:16,544
We have to go.

1066
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:18,025
I'm not gonna let
anything bad happen.

1067
01:20:20,115 --> 01:20:23,151
Nothing bad is gonna happen.

1068
01:21:06,962 --> 01:21:07,962
What are we doing?

1069
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:11,165
What are we doing out here?

1070
01:21:12,768 --> 01:21:15,436
I'm saving you.

1071
01:21:15,437 --> 01:21:16,771
No, I don't need...

1072
01:21:16,772 --> 01:21:17,672
Mm-hmm.

1073
01:21:17,673 --> 01:21:20,541
We need to go back
to the cottage.

1074
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:22,343
Mm-mm.

1075
01:21:22,344 --> 01:21:23,911
What are we doing?

1076
01:21:23,912 --> 01:21:25,346
We need to...

1077
01:21:31,854 --> 01:21:33,521
We need to...

1078
01:21:33,522 --> 01:21:35,089
Untie me.

1079
01:21:36,925 --> 01:21:37,992
Untie me!

1080
01:21:39,094 --> 01:21:41,195
I'm gonna hide you

1081
01:21:41,196 --> 01:21:42,196
under the water.

1082
01:21:42,965 --> 01:21:45,099
They can't reach you there.

1083
01:21:46,602 --> 01:21:48,302
They won't find you.

1084
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:51,406
No, no, no, no.

1085
01:21:51,407 --> 01:21:52,507
Yes.
No, you can't.

1086
01:21:52,508 --> 01:21:55,009
No, I can't hide in the water.

1087
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:56,244
I can't breathe under the water.

1088
01:21:56,245 --> 01:21:57,245
No, you don't understand.

1089
01:21:57,246 --> 01:21:58,880
You're confused.

1090
01:21:58,881 --> 01:22:00,214
No. No, no, no, no.

1091
01:22:00,215 --> 01:22:01,549
No, you have to.
You're confused.

1092
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:03,251
I can't... I can't hide
in the water.

1093
01:22:03,252 --> 01:22:04,519
No, I have to hide you.
Stop it.

1094
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,220
This isn't hiding!
Shh!

1095
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:07,455
You have to hide.
This isn't hiding!

1096
01:22:07,456 --> 01:22:08,456
This isn't hiding!

1097
01:22:08,457 --> 01:22:09,657
Stop it!
Have to!

1098
01:22:09,658 --> 01:22:11,626
No, Bea! Stop it!

1099
01:22:11,627 --> 01:22:12,627
Stop it! No!

1100
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:43,991
For our first date,
Bea chose an Indian restaurant,

1101
01:22:43,992 --> 01:22:45,993
you know, one of
those little places
on Sixth Street

1102
01:22:45,994 --> 01:22:49,497
with the colored lights
and the fiber-optic lamps.

1103
01:22:49,498 --> 01:22:52,667
Yum, except that
halfway through the meal,

1104
01:22:52,668 --> 01:22:54,735
I start feeling
my stomach gurgle

1105
01:22:54,736 --> 01:22:57,705
in a horrible
food-poisoning-type way,

1106
01:22:57,706 --> 01:23:00,975
and I didn't even
have time to lie to her.

1107
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:03,496
I spend 20 minutes
in the dirty restaurant
toilet and the rest...

1108
01:23:05,614 --> 01:23:07,849
of the night
on Bea's bathroom floor,

1109
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:10,518
because I couldn't make it
to the subway,

1110
01:23:10,519 --> 01:23:12,086
let alone Brooklyn.

1111
01:23:14,289 --> 01:23:16,324
So this is our,
"Fuck you, Indian food."

1112
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:18,159
You tried to keep us apart,

1113
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:19,160
but fuck you.

1114
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:22,830
We win.

1115
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,200
So we didn't get
a regular wedding cake.

1116
01:23:26,201 --> 01:23:29,003
We decided on something
that was special
for us instead.

1117
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:30,972
Mm-hmm, special

1118
01:23:30,973 --> 01:23:31,973
and cheap.

1119
01:23:31,974 --> 01:23:33,541
What?

1120
01:23:33,542 --> 01:23:37,445
No, I think some people
are annoyed by no cake.

1121
01:23:40,949 --> 01:23:43,284
Who cares?

1122
01:23:43,285 --> 01:23:45,186
It's our wedding,

1123
01:23:57,966 --> 01:24:00,334
I love you,
honeybee.

1124
01:24:17,085 --> 01:24:20,021
Before, I was alone,

1125
01:24:20,022 --> 01:24:21,856
but now I'm not.
