00:02:59,793 --> 00:03:04,897
I said the similarity
between a Mexican and a Cuban.

4
00:03:04,932 --> 00:03:06,632
I don't know.

5
00:03:06,834 --> 00:03:10,836
I thought I knew before,
but now I don't know.

6
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:14,540
Harder you hit 'em,
the more English
you get out of 'em.

Oh, yeah.

Okay, let's go back
to the line.

15
00:03:33,327 --> 00:03:34,710
We have Lonnie from El Centro.

16
00:03:34,745 --> 00:03:36,345
Hey, Lonnie,
what can I do you for?

17
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:37,647
Lonnie: Hey there,
you know I got them

18
00:03:37,681 --> 00:03:38,898

all over my property.

(Belches)
'Cause it's cheap.

25
00:03:53,346 --> 00:03:55,715
Makes it himself
in his own damn shed.

26
00:03:55,749 --> 00:03:58,434
And it's like
a gazillion proof.

27
00:03:58,468 --> 00:04:02,454
And it tastes like
pb and j sandwich, see?

28
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:04,356
It stinks like shit.

(Sniffs)

30
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,845
Well, maybe you should
take a hit off it, Connie.

31
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,631
It'd loosen you up.

32
00:04:14,884 --> 00:04:18,955
How much looser
y'all want me? Huh?

33
00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:22,591
Is that loose?
Knock it off, Keith!

34
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:26,429
Besides, I don't think Buck
feels much like sharin'.
Ain't that right?

35
00:04:26,463 --> 00:04:29,532
That depends.
Depends on what?

36
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:31,768
What Sharon looks like.

Could you pull over?

41
00:04:38,408 --> 00:04:40,543
I need to use
the little ladies room.

42
00:04:40,577 --> 00:04:43,846
Why? You gotta drop off
the browns at the super bowl?

43
00:04:43,881 --> 00:04:45,865
(Laughs)

44
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:47,833

What's the most

50
00:06:02,793 --> 00:06:05,795
you ever lost on a coin toss?

51
00:06:08,398 --> 00:06:10,365
I said...

52
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,901

You never said nothin' to me

You don't have
to repay me, min-ah.

This guy could come back.

00:44:22,807 --> 00:44:24,240
No big deal.

336
00:44:24,476 --> 00:44:25,842
And have you had
anything to drink tonight?

337
00:44:25,876 --> 00:44:27,111
No, no, not at all.

338
00:44:27,145 --> 00:44:29,813
(Banging)

339
00:44:29,847 --> 00:44:31,047
What was that?

340
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:34,250
Why don't you pop
the trunk for me, sir.

341
00:44:34,486 --> 00:44:35,802
You know, officer, I don't
think it's any big deal.

342
00:44:35,836 --> 00:44:37,237
Just pop the trunk, please.

343
00:44:38,873 --> 00:44:40,140
(Pops trunk)

344
00:45:20,481 --> 00:45:23,933
You're good to go.
Just try to keep your eyes
on the road, all right, sir?

345
00:45:23,968 --> 00:45:25,369
Thank you.

346
00:46:19,023 --> 00:46:22,092
(Puts in park)

347
00:48:35,242 --> 00:48:37,260
(Gasps)

348
00:48:39,864 --> 00:48:42,031
(Muffled screaming)

349
00:48:46,354 --> 00:48:49,071
(Thud)

350
00:48:50,674 --> 00:48:55,111
¶ Some fellows look
and find the sunshine ¶

351
00:48:55,145 --> 00:48:59,982
¶ I always look
and find the rain ¶

352
00:49:00,017 --> 00:49:02,552
(Laughter)

353
00:49:27,445 --> 00:49:30,146
Man: My little brother...

354
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:33,450
Nothin'
I wouldn't do for him...

355
00:49:33,484 --> 00:49:35,786
Or sacrifice
I wouldn't make.

356
00:49:41,592 --> 00:49:43,159
Hey, em, will you get my back?

357
00:49:43,193 --> 00:49:44,594
Yeah, give me a second.

358
00:49:48,632 --> 00:49:50,517
Goal!

359
00:49:51,452 --> 00:49:53,353
Go in there and get it, man.

360
00:49:59,293 --> 00:50:01,327
Can't let you base
too long, okay, babe?

361
00:50:01,362 --> 00:50:03,729
Need to get little man
back home before mom
calls missing persons.

362
00:50:18,312 --> 00:50:20,580
Here you go.

363
00:50:20,614 --> 00:50:23,333
Lower.

364
00:50:23,367 --> 00:50:25,168
Slow.

365
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:47,790
Hey there.

366
00:50:47,824 --> 00:50:49,275
(Crying)

367
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:52,612
Hey there.

368
00:50:52,646 --> 00:50:55,532
(Crying)

369
00:50:57,802 --> 00:51:01,103
Hey. Are you okay in there?

370
00:51:01,138 --> 00:51:03,506
(Crying continues)

371
00:51:08,346 --> 00:51:11,314
Help me.
Please make him go away.

372
00:51:11,349 --> 00:51:12,849
(Growls)

373
00:51:12,883 --> 00:51:14,851
Oh.

374
00:51:14,885 --> 00:51:17,420
I'm just looking for my ball.

375
00:51:17,455 --> 00:51:20,623
(Crying continues)

376
00:51:20,658 --> 00:51:22,158
(Growls)

377
00:51:27,831 --> 00:51:30,283
(Gasps)

378
00:51:30,317 --> 00:51:32,602
What are you doing under here?

379
00:51:32,637 --> 00:51:34,387
I heard a baby crying.

380
00:51:35,506 --> 00:51:38,274
There's no babies
under here, man.

381
00:51:38,308 --> 00:51:40,176
No?
No. Come on.

382
00:51:48,168 --> 00:51:50,620
Hey, hey, em.

383
00:51:50,654 --> 00:51:53,707
What's crackin'?

384
00:51:53,741 --> 00:51:55,357
Hey, we're on time, right?

385
00:51:55,593 --> 00:51:57,343
No. Shop's closed.

386
00:51:57,377 --> 00:52:01,598
Baby, it's a saturday night.

387
00:52:01,632 --> 00:52:03,299
Please?

388
00:52:07,772 --> 00:52:12,341
This is the last time, okay?
I got hours for business, too.

389
00:52:12,375 --> 00:52:14,243
Okay, I promise.

390
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,180
Thank you.

391
00:52:18,215 --> 00:52:19,849
Thanks.

392
00:52:21,602 --> 00:52:23,436
A check?

393
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:25,305
Are you for real?
What the fuck's wrong
with you, bitches?

394
00:52:25,339 --> 00:52:27,773
Come on, Emmett.
It's from my trust account.

395
00:52:27,808 --> 00:52:30,793
It's golden.
Emmett...

396
00:52:30,827 --> 00:52:32,612
Get out the way.
You're blockin' my car.

397
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:36,616
Asshole.
What a dick.

398
00:52:46,928 --> 00:52:49,395
(Starts engine)

399
00:53:01,808 --> 00:53:03,409
Hey, guys.

400
00:53:04,578 --> 00:53:07,546
(Speaking Spanish)

401
00:53:07,581 --> 00:53:09,548
Hey, Emmett, thanks
for those clippers tickets,
man. My kids had a blast.

402
00:53:09,583 --> 00:53:10,716
No problem.

403
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:17,790
Hey, mom.
Hey.

404
00:53:17,824 --> 00:53:20,460
Can you hand me
that tape, Kelly?
Sure.

405
00:53:21,462 --> 00:53:22,695
Thanks.

406
00:53:22,729 --> 00:53:24,064
What time's
the party start tomorrow?

407
00:53:24,098 --> 00:53:25,681
11:00.

408
00:53:25,716 --> 00:53:28,451
Could use your help
wrangling the hooligans.

409
00:53:29,804 --> 00:53:31,471
Bang on my door, find out.

410
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:34,774
I ain't beggin', Emmett.

411
00:53:34,808 --> 00:53:36,392
But I sure could
use your help.

412
00:53:36,426 --> 00:53:37,861
It's saturday night, ma.

413
00:53:44,368 --> 00:53:45,535
Count me in.

414
00:54:30,964 --> 00:54:32,314
(Knock on door)

415
00:54:32,349 --> 00:54:34,316
Mom: Emmett, wake up.
I need your help now.

416
00:54:34,351 --> 00:54:36,786
Oh, shit.

417
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:39,706
Look, I'm sorry.
I ended up oversleep--
Forget sorry.

418
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:42,007
One of Andy's friends, Kade,
is missing from the party.

419
00:54:42,042 --> 00:54:44,110
We think he walked out
of the backyard.

420
00:54:44,144 --> 00:54:46,429
Everybody's searching
the neighborhood
and we're going, too.

421
00:54:46,463 --> 00:54:47,980
Okay, let me get dressed.
I'll go, too.

422
00:54:48,149 --> 00:54:49,965
You let me down.

423
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,051
I needed you,
and you let me down.

424
00:54:52,085 --> 00:54:53,519
I'm sorry.

425
00:54:53,553 --> 00:54:55,387
Look, just pay the clown, okay?

426
00:54:55,422 --> 00:54:56,989
He's gathering his stuff up
in the kitchen.

427
00:54:57,024 --> 00:54:59,459
You think you can do that?

428
00:54:59,493 --> 00:55:00,893
Yeah.

429
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:23,015
Yo. Hey, man. What the fuck
you doin' in my fridge?

430
00:55:25,886 --> 00:55:27,553
Close my fridge, man.

431
00:55:31,658 --> 00:55:32,775
What the fuck?!

432
00:55:32,809 --> 00:55:35,094
I said shut the fridge!

433
00:55:35,129 --> 00:55:37,980
You want the money?
Close the fridge
and get out my house.

434
00:55:40,684 --> 00:55:42,551
Yeah, it's a balloon.

435
00:55:45,139 --> 00:55:46,805
Okay, fucko.
That's it, you're out.

436
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:50,843
Get out my house.
Get out! Out! Out!

437
00:55:52,579 --> 00:55:54,464
(Grunting)

438
00:55:56,833 --> 00:56:00,737
(Grunts) Get out!

439
00:56:02,856 --> 00:56:04,573
Emmett, watch out!

440
00:56:04,608 --> 00:56:06,876
(Groans)

441
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:08,544
(Gasps)

442
00:56:08,578 --> 00:56:12,481
(Grunting)

443
00:56:16,787 --> 00:56:18,771
Kelly: Help! Someone!

444
00:56:18,806 --> 00:56:19,889
(Growls)

445
00:56:19,924 --> 00:56:21,607
(Screams)

446
00:56:21,642 --> 00:56:22,942
Kelly: Stop!
(Grunts)

447
00:56:22,976 --> 00:56:24,660
Kelly: Leave him alone!

448
00:56:24,695 --> 00:56:25,929
Ow!

449
00:56:26,897 --> 00:56:28,114
Oh, shit!

450
00:56:28,148 --> 00:56:29,615
That fucker bit me!

451
00:56:29,649 --> 00:56:32,902
Baby, Emmett...
Emmett, are you okay?

452
00:56:32,937 --> 00:56:35,004
Are you okay?

453
00:56:35,206 --> 00:56:38,908
(Horns honking)

454
00:56:40,911 --> 00:56:43,096
I can't believe
you got bit by a clown.

455
00:56:45,883 --> 00:56:49,752
(Groans)

456
00:56:49,786 --> 00:56:52,488
This is disgusting.

457
00:56:52,523 --> 00:56:54,657
I hope he's not sick.

458
00:56:55,659 --> 00:56:56,892
Sick like how?

459
00:56:56,927 --> 00:56:59,529
Emmett, a clown bit you.

460
00:56:59,563 --> 00:57:01,231
That doesn't happen every day.

461
00:57:01,265 --> 00:57:03,015
Who knows what germs
he's carrying,

462
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:04,784
Diseases he's got.

463
00:57:04,818 --> 00:57:06,769
It's just plain wrong.

464
00:57:06,803 --> 00:57:10,572
It's okay, em.
I'll take care of you.

465
00:57:45,042 --> 00:57:49,194
(Groaning)

466
00:57:50,697 --> 00:57:52,097
Oh, shit.

467
00:57:55,535 --> 00:57:57,903
You don't look so good.

468
00:57:57,937 --> 00:58:02,674
I'm fine.
I'm just kinda hungry.

469
00:58:10,217 --> 00:58:12,918
Animal cracker?

470
00:58:12,952 --> 00:58:14,686
What am I, four?

471
00:58:16,273 --> 00:58:18,007
Yo, Emmett, hey.
What up?

472
00:58:18,042 --> 00:58:20,593
(Indistinct)

473
00:58:20,627 --> 00:58:24,863
Oh, look at that.
Yeah.

474
00:58:24,898 --> 00:58:26,232
Oh, man.

475
00:58:28,268 --> 00:58:29,719
Both: Whoa!

476
00:58:29,753 --> 00:58:34,156
(Laughs) Dude,
that was fucking epic!

477
00:58:35,792 --> 00:58:37,693
(Groaning)

478
00:58:37,728 --> 00:58:38,894
Kelly.

479
00:58:39,129 --> 00:58:40,913
How's he doing?

480
00:58:40,947 --> 00:58:44,684
Okay.
He's just a little--

481
00:58:44,718 --> 00:58:48,220
I'm fine, ma.
Andy asleep?

482
00:58:48,254 --> 00:58:52,191
Yes, took forever. That boy's
been a mess ever since
Kade up and walked off.

483
00:58:52,225 --> 00:58:53,959
Can't have me worrying
about you, too.

484
00:58:53,993 --> 00:58:56,095
Nah, I'm fine.

485
00:58:56,129 --> 00:58:58,564
Kelly tried to poison me
with some nasty ass cookies
is all.

486
00:58:58,598 --> 00:59:00,616
The detectives
wanna talk to you.

487
00:59:00,651 --> 00:59:03,102
I told them you were sleeping,
but they said they need it
for their report.

488
00:59:03,136 --> 00:59:06,005
Okay. No problem.
I'll be right there.
Let me put some clothes on.

489
00:59:08,842 --> 00:59:09,875
(Door shuts)

490
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:12,778
(Gurgling)

491
00:59:12,813 --> 00:59:14,981
(Groans)

492
00:59:15,015 --> 00:59:16,182
Are you okay?

493
00:59:16,216 --> 00:59:17,650
(Groans)

494
00:59:24,891 --> 00:59:27,793
I wish I wasn't sleeping.
Maybe I would have seen
the kid walk off.

495
00:59:27,827 --> 00:59:31,280
Did both of you know
everyone at the party?

496
00:59:31,515 --> 00:59:33,298
Yes.
Except that clown.

497
00:59:33,333 --> 00:59:36,952
A clown?
What clown?

498
00:59:37,221 --> 00:59:38,937
It was the clown
that bit me.

499
00:59:38,972 --> 00:59:40,973
He was raiding
through our fridge,
so I kicked him out.

500
00:59:42,059 --> 00:59:43,959
You got bit by a clown?

501
00:59:44,194 --> 00:59:47,797
Yeah, I know, right?
It's crazy. Right on my leg.

502
00:59:47,831 --> 00:59:50,900
Funny, I never heard
of a clown biting before.

503
00:59:50,934 --> 00:59:54,403
Yeah, there was that one
back in '88 at the marina.

504
00:59:54,437 --> 00:59:57,706
Oh, no, no, no,
that wasn't a clown,
that was a mime.

505
00:59:57,741 --> 00:59:59,708
No, it was a clown.

506
00:59:59,743 --> 01:00:01,710
Oh, no, no, Ray,
that was a mime.

507
01:00:01,745 --> 01:00:04,247
That was a mime
as sure as I'm sitting here.

508
01:00:04,281 --> 01:00:07,032
I know a clown
when I see one, Sam.

509
01:00:07,067 --> 01:00:10,035
Yeah, well, you didn't
see one at the Marina
because it was a god damn mime.

510
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:13,138
It was a god damn clown, okay?
Look, let's just agree
to disagree. How about that?

511
01:00:13,173 --> 01:00:15,641
Okay, sure, fine,
'cause you're wrong.

512
01:00:15,676 --> 01:00:18,077
I am not wrong!
You're wrong!
No, you're wrong!

513
01:00:18,111 --> 01:00:20,713
I know the difference
between a god damn clown
and a mime, okay?

514
01:00:20,747 --> 01:00:25,351
Okay, okay, okay!
Anyway, it was a clown.
He bit me. He ran off.

515
01:00:25,519 --> 01:00:29,705
He was very suspicious.
You find the clown,
you find the kid.

516
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:30,973
I'm sure of it.

517
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:36,094
What's the clown's name?

518
01:00:36,129 --> 01:00:38,164
I don't know.
He didn't speak.

519
01:00:39,666 --> 01:00:42,435
Oh, well, then possibly
it was just a mime then.

520
01:00:42,469 --> 01:00:44,920
Okay, the clown's name
was fucko, okay?

521
01:00:44,954 --> 01:00:47,156
Fuck, fucko the clown,
and he bit Emmett.

522
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:50,842
A clown--
Not a mime, a clown.
Write that down.

523
01:01:01,721 --> 01:01:03,956
Fucko.

524
01:01:03,991 --> 01:01:05,691
Strange name.

525
01:01:05,725 --> 01:01:08,928
Hmm. I've never heard
of a clown named fucko.

526
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,834
Can you tell us anything else
about this clown?

527
01:01:15,869 --> 01:01:17,503
What was his act?

528
01:01:19,956 --> 01:01:22,408
(Horns honking)

529
01:01:37,357 --> 01:01:39,692
What the hell?

530
01:01:43,546 --> 01:01:45,698
(Footsteps, heavy breathing)

531
01:02:47,093 --> 01:02:48,261
(Gasps)

532
01:03:15,188 --> 01:03:17,473
You would never hurt me,
would you, Emmett?

533
01:03:17,507 --> 01:03:22,144
Never, Andy.
I love you.

534
01:03:22,178 --> 01:03:25,314
You're my little brother.
I'll always protect you.

535
01:03:25,348 --> 01:03:27,182
Then why am I so afraid of you?

536
01:03:29,085 --> 01:03:30,536
(Screams)

537
01:03:30,570 --> 01:03:32,405
(Gasps)

538
01:04:29,379 --> 01:04:32,181
Jeez.

539
01:04:32,215 --> 01:04:34,450
Emmett my face.

540
01:04:34,484 --> 01:04:37,486
My skin was changing.

541
01:04:39,672 --> 01:04:41,273
Oh.

542
01:04:58,975 --> 01:05:01,277
(Groaning)

543
01:05:07,067 --> 01:05:08,867
Fuck!

544
01:05:10,236 --> 01:05:15,308
(Whimpering)

545
01:05:28,355 --> 01:05:30,171
(Ball bouncing)

546
01:05:38,147 --> 01:05:41,367
The urge to feed was strong.

547
01:05:41,401 --> 01:05:43,369
I wanted him--

548
01:05:43,403 --> 01:05:45,004
Andy.

549
01:05:50,276 --> 01:05:52,244
I had to get away.

550
01:05:52,278 --> 01:05:55,330
You've gotta get some sleep.
That was a long shift.

551
01:05:55,565 --> 01:05:59,551
I just wanted to stop by
and see how everyone was doing
before I crashed.

552
01:05:59,585 --> 01:06:01,353
I'm sorry I blew up last night.

553
01:06:01,387 --> 01:06:03,205
Oh, that's okay.

554
01:06:03,239 --> 01:06:04,606
I'm worried about Emmett.

555
01:06:04,641 --> 01:06:06,525
He'll be fine.

556
01:06:18,321 --> 01:06:19,521
What?

557
01:06:22,575 --> 01:06:24,576
What is going on?

558
01:06:28,432 --> 01:06:30,599
Come on!

559
01:06:32,352 --> 01:06:33,519
(Grunts)

560
01:06:53,807 --> 01:06:55,807
Mom's gotta have a long sleeve.

561
01:06:55,842 --> 01:07:00,262
You've been working too hard.
And you know Emmett
can be a handful.

562
01:07:08,638 --> 01:07:10,723
I don't know, Frances.

563
01:07:10,757 --> 01:07:14,460
He's been acting
really strange lately...

564
01:07:14,494 --> 01:07:16,395
Ever since that clown bit him.

565
01:07:23,636 --> 01:07:26,638
If I didn't leave fast...

566
01:07:26,672 --> 01:07:28,774
I'm afraid of what
I would've done.

567
01:07:28,808 --> 01:07:31,043
What did the doctor say?
Good luck with that.

568
01:07:31,077 --> 01:07:33,512
Emmett is not
gonna see a doctor.

569
01:07:33,546 --> 01:07:36,381
(Door opens)

570
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:48,293
(Phone beeps)

571
01:07:48,328 --> 01:07:50,211
It's from Emmett.

572
01:07:52,265 --> 01:07:54,766
"Trouble. Gotta find that clown.
Call you later."

573
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:57,336
What does that mean?

574
01:07:57,370 --> 01:07:59,171
He's gone. He went
to go look for the clown.

575
01:07:59,205 --> 01:08:00,822
Maybe he didn't
know you were here.

576
01:08:00,857 --> 01:08:06,195
No, you don't understand.
Something is wrong with him.

577
01:08:09,532 --> 01:08:11,349
(Siren wails)

578
01:08:14,553 --> 01:08:16,554
(Helicopter whirring)

579
01:09:00,249 --> 01:09:04,736
I had to hide my face...

580
01:09:04,771 --> 01:09:06,872
Hide what I was becoming.

581
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:13,478
I couldn't let anyone
see me like this.

582
01:09:31,764 --> 01:09:35,466
I would live my life
in the shadows...

583
01:09:35,501 --> 01:09:39,738
Silently walking...

584
01:09:39,772 --> 01:09:42,925
Prowling for the innocence...

585
01:09:42,959 --> 01:09:44,693
To consume.

586
01:09:54,537 --> 01:09:57,239
I never felt a hunger
like this before.

587
01:09:57,273 --> 01:09:58,874
(Grunting)

588
01:11:04,491 --> 01:11:06,492
(Footsteps, heavy breathing)

589
01:11:56,910 --> 01:11:58,911
(Crying)

590
01:12:24,537 --> 01:12:28,523
Something deep inside me...

591
01:12:28,558 --> 01:12:30,826
Fighting the inevitable.

592
01:13:03,876 --> 01:13:04,959
(Grunts)

593
01:13:09,598 --> 01:13:11,833
My mouth...

594
01:13:11,867 --> 01:13:15,703
Sealed shut as if my own body
hates what it's becoming.

595
01:13:17,957 --> 01:13:19,741
(Grunting)

596
01:13:23,479 --> 01:13:27,616
(Groaning)

597
01:13:35,157 --> 01:13:38,793
(Continues groaning)

598
01:13:42,064 --> 01:13:43,165
(Screams)

599
01:13:44,767 --> 01:13:47,602
What the hell am I?

600
01:13:47,636 --> 01:13:49,504
(Gurgling)

601
01:14:10,776 --> 01:14:13,145
(Phone rings, beeps)

602
01:14:13,179 --> 01:14:14,779
Emmett: Kelly.

603
01:14:14,813 --> 01:14:16,882
Oh, my god.
Emmett, where are you?

604
01:14:16,916 --> 01:14:18,116
Let me come and get you.

605
01:14:18,150 --> 01:14:19,985
Please don't.

606
01:14:20,019 --> 01:14:23,755
Whatever trouble you're in,
I'll help you.

607
01:14:23,789 --> 01:14:28,193
It's my fault.
I have to find the clown.

608
01:14:28,361 --> 01:14:33,582
Forget the clown, Emmett.
Just come home.

609
01:14:35,951 --> 01:14:38,120
I have to tell you something.

610
01:14:38,154 --> 01:14:40,855
Tell Andy...

611
01:14:40,890 --> 01:14:42,223
I'll never hurt him.

612
01:14:42,258 --> 01:14:44,059
(Click)

613
01:14:44,093 --> 01:14:46,027
(Beeps)

614
01:14:51,301 --> 01:14:53,085
(Crying)

615
01:15:30,873 --> 01:15:33,608
Emmett, please come home.

616
01:17:13,176 --> 01:17:17,362
Man: Pull his shoes off!
Come on, get his shoes off!

617
01:17:17,396 --> 01:17:20,215
I can't! They're stuck!
His feet are too big!

618
01:17:20,249 --> 01:17:23,251
(Grunting)

619
01:17:26,255 --> 01:17:30,075
(Growling)

620
01:17:30,109 --> 01:17:34,379
(Screaming)

621
01:17:40,987 --> 01:17:42,453
Feed me.

622
01:17:42,488 --> 01:17:47,092
Feed my urge.

623
01:17:47,126 --> 01:17:50,361
Once I tasted it,
I wanted more.

624
01:17:50,395 --> 01:17:52,831
I needed more.

625
01:17:52,865 --> 01:17:54,265
(Doorbell rings)

626
01:18:03,091 --> 01:18:04,426
Who sent this?

627
01:18:09,464 --> 01:18:10,982
"He's mine now."

628
01:18:11,016 --> 01:18:14,136
Where's Andy?
Sleeping!

629
01:18:14,170 --> 01:18:15,220
Andy!

630
01:18:20,292 --> 01:18:23,145
(Both gasp)

631
01:18:23,179 --> 01:18:25,363
My baby!

632
01:18:31,387 --> 01:18:35,206
Where are you
taking me, Emmett?

633
01:18:35,241 --> 01:18:38,376
I'm scared, Emmett.

634
01:18:38,410 --> 01:18:40,461
(Phone rings)
Franks.

635
01:18:40,496 --> 01:18:42,330
Man: Detective,
we've got a child abduction

636
01:18:42,364 --> 01:18:44,065
on the corner
of Ringling and Vargas.

637
01:18:44,099 --> 01:18:46,867
We're on our way.

638
01:18:47,853 --> 01:18:49,521
(Tires screech)

639
01:19:32,882 --> 01:19:37,135
What are we doing here, Emmett?
I just wanna go home now.

640
01:19:39,588 --> 01:19:41,155
(Laughs)

641
01:19:41,190 --> 01:19:42,823
You're not Emmett!

642
01:19:45,995 --> 01:19:48,363
Run, Andy! Run home!

643
01:19:54,537 --> 01:19:58,005
(Groaning)

644
01:20:01,327 --> 01:20:08,032
(Groaning)

645
01:20:08,066 --> 01:20:13,855
(Panting)

646
01:20:13,889 --> 01:20:18,192
(Groaning)

647
01:20:35,928 --> 01:20:39,046
Thank you, sir.
May I have another?

648
01:20:44,904 --> 01:20:46,170
(Grunts)

649
01:20:55,414 --> 01:20:57,181
(Growling)

650
01:20:57,215 --> 01:20:59,150
(Gasps)

651
01:20:59,184 --> 01:21:02,354
(Continues growling)

652
01:21:08,393 --> 01:21:11,462
Andy...

653
01:21:11,496 --> 01:21:13,264
Uh...

654
01:21:14,367 --> 01:21:16,901
I'm sorry, Andy.

655
01:21:26,078 --> 01:21:30,231
I didn't mean
for you to see that.

656
01:21:30,265 --> 01:21:32,583
You'd never hurt me like that,
would you, Emmett?

657
01:21:32,617 --> 01:21:36,154
Oh, no. No, Andy.

658
01:21:37,790 --> 01:21:39,323
I would never let that happen.

659
01:21:39,592 --> 01:21:42,160
Not to you.

660
01:21:42,194 --> 01:21:44,312
I would die first, Andy...

661
01:21:44,346 --> 01:21:46,648
Before I'd...

662
01:21:46,682 --> 01:21:48,650
Before I'd...

663
01:21:51,186 --> 01:21:54,556
Let myself hurt you.

664
01:21:54,590 --> 01:21:57,442
Then why am I so afraid of you?

665
01:22:00,512 --> 01:22:03,498
Run Andy! Run home, Andy!

666
01:22:03,532 --> 01:22:06,133
I'll never let myself hurt you!

667
01:22:11,407 --> 01:22:13,408
I'd die first, Andy.

668
01:22:19,014 --> 01:22:21,015
I'd die first, Andy.

669
01:22:32,193 --> 01:22:34,078
(Children chattering)

670
01:22:47,592 --> 01:22:50,511
(Growls)

671
01:23:00,155 --> 01:23:03,007
(Sniffs)

672
01:23:07,446 --> 01:23:11,048
(Growls)

673
01:23:33,489 --> 01:23:35,006
(Tires screech)

674
01:23:37,242 --> 01:23:38,709
(Brakes squeal)

675
01:23:38,744 --> 01:23:40,344
My brother Andy...

676
01:23:42,097 --> 01:23:43,397
Hands up, clowny!

677
01:23:44,766 --> 01:23:47,268
Nothing I wouldn't do for him.

678
01:23:49,638 --> 01:23:56,377
(Groaning)

679
01:23:59,481 --> 01:24:02,366
(Gurgling)

680
01:24:03,586 --> 01:24:06,387
(Panting)

681
01:24:06,421 --> 01:24:08,238
What the hell you do that for?

682
01:24:10,192 --> 01:24:11,459
Bang.

683
01:24:13,862 --> 01:24:16,681
(Laughs)

684
01:24:29,695 --> 01:24:32,363
Boy 1: There she is.
Hey, lady, can we see your baby?

685
01:24:32,398 --> 01:24:34,332
Boy 2: Look at the size
of his feet!

686
01:24:34,366 --> 01:24:35,866
(Horn honks)

687
01:24:58,173 --> 01:25:03,144
Woman: l.A. Is a long way
from the parish.

688
01:25:03,178 --> 01:25:06,413
And I sure as hell never
expected to find true love

689
01:25:06,448 --> 01:25:08,449
In a city like this.

690
01:25:21,597 --> 01:25:23,831
But I did.

691
01:25:23,865 --> 01:25:25,866
And it was beautiful.

692
01:25:29,605 --> 01:25:31,606
He was beautiful.

693
01:25:34,343 --> 01:25:36,344
We were made for each other.

694
01:25:40,349 --> 01:25:41,749
We fit.

695
01:25:44,353 --> 01:25:45,886
He told me that.

696
01:25:48,357 --> 01:25:52,326
We had some days.
We did.

697
01:25:52,361 --> 01:25:55,896
And I loved that man
with every ounce of my being.

698
01:26:03,905 --> 01:26:07,341
The first few months
after we were married

699
01:26:07,376 --> 01:26:09,510
were the happiest days
of my life.

700
01:26:11,647 --> 01:26:14,382
We couldn't get enough
of each other.

701
01:26:26,495 --> 01:26:28,813
I felt the power of his love.

702
01:26:28,847 --> 01:26:32,700
And my heart was full
to bursting.

703
01:26:34,937 --> 01:26:37,471
I dreamed of someone like him.

704
01:26:39,742 --> 01:26:43,544
But never thought he existed.

705
01:26:44,663 --> 01:26:46,797
Just a little girl's dream.

706
01:26:52,404 --> 01:26:54,372
Back in New Orleans,
my Gran Pere

707
01:26:54,406 --> 01:26:57,275
was known around the parish
as a protector.

708
01:26:58,544 --> 01:27:01,245
He watched over folks,

709
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:03,281
watched over me.

710
01:27:06,818 --> 01:27:09,520
Some may call him
a conjurer,

711
01:27:09,555 --> 01:27:13,558
as he knew the ways
of the old ones.

712
01:27:13,592 --> 01:27:17,695
Some say my Gran Pere
could cast some spells.

713
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:26,487
He blew what they called
the goofer dust on me
back then...

714
01:27:26,521 --> 01:27:31,359
And gave me some
in a little vial
that I wear today.

715
01:27:31,393 --> 01:27:35,063
He said it was the dirt
my dead kin were buried in,

716
01:27:35,097 --> 01:27:37,415
said that his mojo
would protect me

717
01:27:37,449 --> 01:27:40,851
when he weren't on this side
of the grass no more,

718
01:27:40,885 --> 01:27:44,038
when the dirt reclaimed him.

719
01:27:44,072 --> 01:27:47,508
I never told anyone
what it was.

720
01:27:47,542 --> 01:27:49,643
My gift from Gran Pere.

721
01:27:53,482 --> 01:27:56,717
I can't cry now
or shed no more tears.

722
01:27:56,751 --> 01:27:58,719
But after a while,

723
01:27:58,753 --> 01:28:01,622
that man started
treating me differently.

724
01:28:03,408 --> 01:28:05,008
Badly.

725
01:28:08,797 --> 01:28:11,649
A man's not supposed
to lay hands on his woman

726
01:28:11,683 --> 01:28:13,917
Unless they lovin' hands.

727
01:28:16,354 --> 01:28:20,457
I'd wish it was
like it was before.

728
01:28:20,491 --> 01:28:23,077
But I knew there were others.

729
01:28:23,111 --> 01:28:24,962
A woman knows.

730
01:28:27,049 --> 01:28:28,682
Our Gran Pere always said

731
01:28:28,951 --> 01:28:31,602
his granddaughter
deserved to be loved.

732
01:28:31,636 --> 01:28:36,924
And if I ever had
that love in my heart...

733
01:28:36,959 --> 01:28:40,811
It would never die.

734
01:28:46,384 --> 01:28:48,618
I knew he was a player.

735
01:28:48,653 --> 01:28:51,655
I just thought
he was done playin'.

736
01:28:51,857 --> 01:28:56,710
I told him that I couldn't
stand for no more cheatin'.

737
01:28:56,744 --> 01:28:59,914
I told him
I deserved better.

738
01:28:59,948 --> 01:29:01,866
He didn't like that.

739
01:29:08,123 --> 01:29:10,508
He was my man.

740
01:29:10,542 --> 01:29:12,209
And I loved him...

741
01:29:16,081 --> 01:29:20,918
Even if he did
that bad thing to me.

742
01:29:20,952 --> 01:29:25,923
(Choking)

743
01:29:30,863 --> 01:29:33,113
And I have that love
in my heart.

744
01:29:45,043 --> 01:29:47,778
And just like
my Gran Pere promised...

745
01:29:54,002 --> 01:29:55,769
That love...

746
01:29:59,073 --> 01:30:01,008
Would never...

747
01:30:01,042 --> 01:30:03,110
Die.

748
01:30:10,034 --> 01:30:12,887
Like it or not...

749
01:30:12,921 --> 01:30:16,657
We would spend eternity...

750
01:30:16,691 --> 01:30:17,792
Together.

751
01:30:18,894 --> 01:30:20,895
(Breathing heavily)

752
01:30:29,037 --> 01:30:30,504
(Growls)

753
01:30:49,791 --> 01:30:51,792
