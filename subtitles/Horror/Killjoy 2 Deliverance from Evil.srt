1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,517
-ARMY OF DARKNESS-

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,517
Director's cut

3
00:00:32,255 --> 00:00:35,884
My name is Ash,
and I am a slave.

4
00:00:36,092 --> 00:00:38,887
- Aah !

5
00:00:39,095 --> 00:00:41,723
Close as I can figure it,
the year is 1300 A.D.,

6
00:00:41,931 --> 00:00:44,350
and I'm being
dragged to my death.

7
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,187
It wasn't always
like this.

8
00:00:47,395 --> 00:00:51,107
I had
a real life once.

9
00:00:51,608 --> 00:00:53,526
A job.

10
00:00:53,735 --> 00:00:58,489
Ash to price check four.

11
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,075
Um, hardware, aisle 12.

12
00:01:01,284 --> 00:01:03,244
Shop smart.
Shop S-mart.

13
00:01:03,453 --> 00:01:08,124
I had a wonderful
girlfriend, Linda.

14
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:14,255
Together, we drove to
a small cabin in the mountains.

15
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,761
It seems an archaeologist
had come to this remote place...

16
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:22,764
to translate and study
his latest find,

17
00:01:22,972 --> 00:01:26,100
"Necronomicon Ex Mortis,"

18
00:01:26,309 --> 00:01:30,229
"The Book of the Dead."

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,900
Bound in human flesh
and inked in blood,

20
00:01:34,108 --> 00:01:38,446
this ancient Sumerian text
contained bizarre burial rites,

21
00:01:38,654 --> 00:01:43,701
funerary incantations
and demon resurrection passages.

22
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,829
It was never meant
for the world of the living.

23
00:01:47,038 --> 00:01:52,168
The book awoke
something dark in the woods.

24
00:01:57,631 --> 00:01:59,633
It took Linda.

25
00:01:59,842 --> 00:02:02,678
- And then it came for me.

26
00:02:02,887 --> 00:02:05,848
It got into my hand
and it went bad.

27
00:02:06,056 --> 00:02:08,476
So I lopped it off
at the wrist.

28
00:02:14,732 --> 00:02:17,359
But that didn't stop it.
It came back.

29
00:02:17,568 --> 00:02:21,155
- Big time.

30
00:02:21,363 --> 00:02:23,824
Ah !

31
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:27,578
Aah !

32
00:02:36,712 --> 00:02:40,007
My God !

33
00:02:40,215 --> 00:02:42,050
How do you stop it ?

34
00:03:38,773 --> 00:03:40,859
- Surround the stranger !

35
00:03:43,945 --> 00:03:46,698
All right,
you men, fall in !

36
00:03:51,286 --> 00:03:53,580
All o' ya, keep a pace !

37
00:03:53,788 --> 00:03:56,833
Where in the hell--

38
00:04:03,756 --> 00:04:05,800
Stand fast, hellhound !

39
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:09,304
No, no.
Easy now, chief.

40
00:04:09,512 --> 00:04:11,264
Uh, I don't know
how I got here,

41
00:04:11,472 --> 00:04:15,768
- and, uh, uh, I'm not
looking for any trouble.

42
00:04:18,146 --> 00:04:22,233
What a piece of armor this is !

43
00:04:22,483 --> 00:04:24,902
- Wise man !
- Fall back ! Come on, all you men.

44
00:04:25,111 --> 00:04:28,489
Back on your horses.
Come on !

45
00:04:29,198 --> 00:04:32,910
My lord, I believe he is the one
written of in the Necronomicon.

46
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:35,413
He who's prophesied to fall
from the heavens...

47
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:38,416
and deliver us from
the terrors of the Deadites.

48
00:04:38,624 --> 00:04:40,209
What, that buffoon ?

49
00:04:40,418 --> 00:04:42,753
Likely...

50
00:04:42,962 --> 00:04:44,797
he's one
of Henry's men !

51
00:04:45,006 --> 00:04:48,926
- Kneel, rapscallions !

52
00:04:49,093 --> 00:04:51,804
I say
to the pit with him !

53
00:04:52,013 --> 00:04:55,975
You shall soon
learn the horrors of the pit.

54
00:04:56,183 --> 00:04:59,520
- To the pit !
- You miserable bast--

55
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:04,775
- Get him !
- Get off of me !

56
00:05:05,401 --> 00:05:08,195
- Let me go !
- Chain him !

57
00:05:10,865 --> 00:05:12,825
Ah, you're gonna have
a little bit of wee fun, mate.

58
00:05:15,202 --> 00:05:18,789
To the castle !

59
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,960
Pick up your feet !
Stop draggin' your feet !

60
00:05:23,168 --> 00:05:25,296
Come on !
Move along !

61
00:05:25,504 --> 00:05:27,464
Come on, now.

62
00:05:27,673 --> 00:05:30,509
Come on, pick it up.
Have a taste of this !

63
00:05:37,766 --> 00:05:40,728
You men got something
to look forward to...

64
00:05:40,936 --> 00:05:44,440
when you get back to the castle.

65
00:05:44,648 --> 00:05:46,442
Lord Arthur approaches !

66
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,528
Raise the portcullis !

67
00:05:49,736 --> 00:05:55,868
Lord Arthur !
Lord Arthur approaches !

68
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,707
That's lovely, isn't it ?
Move it in.

69
00:06:01,915 --> 00:06:05,669
Move it,
you worthless--

70
00:06:05,877 --> 00:06:09,381
- Get on !

71
00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:27,482
Move it up, boys.
God save the king !

72
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:30,443
God save the king.
We love him !
73
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:44,032
Arthur !
He's back !

74
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:48,870
Lord Arthur, where is my brother ?
Did he not ride with you ?

75
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:51,039
Aye,
and fought valiantly.

76
00:06:51,248 --> 00:06:54,626
But last night he fell in battle
to Duke Henry's men.

77
00:06:54,835 --> 00:06:56,878
I'm sorry, Sheila.

78
00:06:57,087 --> 00:06:58,755
Come on.

79
00:06:58,964 --> 00:07:02,217
You cretin !
Ah, stop it, you bastard !

80
00:07:04,428 --> 00:07:06,388
You barbarian !

81
00:07:06,596 --> 00:07:09,433
- Oh, no ! Stop it ! Stop it !

82
00:07:09,641 --> 00:07:11,810
Get outta here,
you little brat !

83
00:07:15,647 --> 00:07:19,693
Foul thing !
A pox on you, brute !

84
00:07:19,901 --> 00:07:22,821
Thou art a murderer !
A black murderer !

85
00:07:28,034 --> 00:07:29,953
My brother's death
shall be avenged !

86
00:07:44,717 --> 00:07:48,346
Company, halt !

87
00:07:50,515 --> 00:07:54,102
Get that yoke off 'im !

88
00:07:54,811 --> 00:07:57,438
Kill them !

89
00:07:57,647 --> 00:07:59,524
Put them into the pit !

90
00:08:06,447 --> 00:08:10,576
You, sir,
are not one of my vassals.

91
00:08:10,785 --> 00:08:12,996
Who are you ?

92
00:08:13,204 --> 00:08:15,957
Who wants to know ?

93
00:08:16,165 --> 00:08:18,126
I am Henry the Red,

94
00:08:18,334 --> 00:08:22,672
Duke of Shael, Lord of the Northlands
and leader of its peoples.

95
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,801
Well, hello,
Mr. Fancy Pants.

96
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:29,846
I got news for you, pal. You ain't
leadin' but two things right now--

97
00:08:30,054 --> 00:08:32,890
Jack and shit,
and Jack left town.

98
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:34,225
Shut your bleedin' hole !

99
00:08:34,433 --> 00:08:35,810
Shut your bleedin' hole !

100
00:08:36,018 --> 00:08:39,605
Gentlemen, Lord Arthur !

101
00:08:45,987 --> 00:08:49,448
There is an evil
awakened in this land,

102
00:08:49,657 --> 00:08:53,202
and while my people fight
for their very souls against it,

103
00:08:53,411 --> 00:08:56,205
you, Henry the Red,
wage war on us !

104
00:08:56,414 --> 00:09:00,418
Charlatan !
Aah !

105
00:09:00,626 --> 00:09:03,337
It was you who first turned
your swords on us !

106
00:09:03,546 --> 00:09:06,423
And this evil has befouled
my people as well !

107
00:09:06,632 --> 00:09:09,426
Your people are no better
than the foul corruption...

108
00:09:09,635 --> 00:09:11,554
that lies in the bowels of that pit.

109
00:09:11,762 --> 00:09:14,515
Right, you're no better.

110
00:09:14,723 --> 00:09:17,059
May God
have mercy upon your souls.

111
00:09:31,198 --> 00:09:36,537
God's name !
What hell-spawned thing lurks there ?

112
00:09:40,457 --> 00:09:44,086
Into the pit with those
bloodthirsty sons of 'hores !

113
00:09:44,294 --> 00:09:48,507
No ! No !

114
00:09:48,632 --> 00:09:51,552
No, no ! Aah !

115
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:22,415
Oh ! Heavenly God !

116
00:10:24,334 --> 00:10:26,378
He's escaping !

117
00:10:26,586 --> 00:10:30,257
- Hold to !
- Hold him !

118
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,497
- Who's next ?
- It's him. Aye, he trembles !

119
00:11:02,705 --> 00:11:06,042
They don't look
so clever now, do they ?

120
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:10,588
He's frightened !
He's frightened white !

121
00:11:10,797 --> 00:11:12,966
Whoa ! Whoa !

122
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:15,927
Wait a minute. Hold it.

123
00:11:16,135 --> 00:11:20,515
W-Wait a minute.
You gotta understand, man.

124
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:23,184
I never even saw
these assholes before.

125
00:11:23,393 --> 00:11:25,353
- Get him in there !
- He trembles !

126
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:27,480
He's begging !

127
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:30,149
- What are you waitin' for ?
- Henry !

128
00:11:30,358 --> 00:11:32,193
You gotta tell him
you don't know me.

129
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:36,614
We never met.
Tell him.

130
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:41,369
I do not think
he'll listen, lad.

131
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:42,703
Look.

132
00:11:42,912 --> 00:11:47,667
I'm tellin' you,
you got the wrong guy.

133
00:11:56,258 --> 00:12:00,346
I'm tellin' you,
you got the wrong guy.

134
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:04,141
Uh, wh-whoa.

135
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,685
- Aah !

136
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:59,863
How do you like the pit ?
Isn't the pit wonderful ?

137
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,087
- Hai-ya !

138
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:19,216
- Why, you--

139
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,968
Ha !

140
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:24,012
Spikes.

141
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:28,683
Hey ! He says, "Spikes."
Give him spikes !

142
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:45,450
Make way !
Strange one !

143
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,171
- Strange one !

144
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:03,551
Yaaah !

145
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,639
Yes !

146
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,571
Damn you.
Damn you !

147
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:52,201
You know,
your shoelace is untied.

148
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,254
All right.

149
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,174
Who wants some ?

150
00:16:07,382 --> 00:16:10,844
Who's next, huh ?

151
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,929
How 'bout it ?

152
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,515
Who wants some, huh ?

153
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:19,603
Who wants
to have a little ?

154
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:27,902
You.
You want some more ?

155
00:16:28,277 --> 00:16:31,405
Huh ?

156
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:35,159
You want a little ?

157
00:16:35,743 --> 00:16:38,454
Do ya ? Do ya ?
Do ya want some more?

158
00:16:38,662 --> 00:16:42,833
Huh ? Huh ?

159
00:16:55,179 --> 00:16:59,767
Now get on those horses
and get outta here.

160
00:17:01,852 --> 00:17:05,022
Let 'em go !

161
00:17:28,126 --> 00:17:30,879
- Halt !

162
00:17:31,087 --> 00:17:34,341
Thank you, generous hosts !

163
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:37,969
Sword boy !

164
00:17:44,267 --> 00:17:49,355
For that arrogance,
I shall see you dead.

165
00:17:58,615 --> 00:18:00,533
Yeah.

166
00:18:00,742 --> 00:18:04,579
All right, you primitive screwheads,
listen up.

167
00:18:04,787 --> 00:18:06,956
See this ?

168
00:18:07,165 --> 00:18:11,836
- This is my boom stick !

169
00:18:12,045 --> 00:18:14,380
It's a 12-gauge,
double-barreled Remington.

170
00:18:14,589 --> 00:18:16,466
S-mart's
top of the line.

171
00:18:16,674 --> 00:18:19,594
You can find this in
the sporting goods department.

172
00:18:19,802 --> 00:18:23,097
That's right. This sweet baby
was made in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

173
00:18:23,306 --> 00:18:26,601
Retails for about $109.95.

174
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:31,522
It's got a walnut stock,
cobalt blue steel and a hair trigger.

175
00:18:31,731 --> 00:18:35,026
That's right, shop smart.

176
00:18:35,234 --> 00:18:38,279
Shop S-mart.
You got that ?

177
00:18:38,487 --> 00:18:40,281
- Yes, sir. Right.
- Yes, sir.

178
00:18:40,489 --> 00:18:42,491
Now I swear,

179
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,786
the next one
of you primates...

180
00:18:45,995 --> 00:18:49,665
even touches me--

181
00:19:16,358 --> 00:19:21,447
Now, let's talk about
how I get back home.

182
00:19:53,935 --> 00:19:56,479
I prithee to forgive me,
m'lord.

183
00:19:56,688 --> 00:19:59,357
I believed thee
one of Henry's men.

184
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:03,570
First you wanna kill me,
now you wanna kiss me.

185
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:06,156
Blow.

186
00:20:08,616 --> 00:20:11,745
So what's the deal ?
Can you send me back or not ?

187
00:20:11,953 --> 00:20:14,497
Only the Necronomicon
has the power.

188
00:20:14,706 --> 00:20:16,833
An unholy book
which we also require.

189
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:20,628
Within its pages are passages
that can send you back to your time.

190
00:20:20,837 --> 00:20:24,632
Only you, The Promised One,
can quest for it.

191
00:20:24,841 --> 00:20:28,094
I don't want your book.
I don't want your bullshit.

192
00:20:28,303 --> 00:20:33,516
Just send me back to my own time.
Pronto, today, chop--

193
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,485
- You shall die !

194
00:20:50,825 --> 00:20:54,412
You shall never obtain
the Necronomicon !

195
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,916
We shall feast
upon your souls !

196
00:21:02,086 --> 00:21:05,881
Oh !

197
00:21:19,937 --> 00:21:24,066
- It's a trick. Get an axe.

198
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:32,283
- Guards, stop it !

199
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,952
- Catch the witch !
- Death to the witch !

200
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:37,079
Have some porridge !

201
00:21:37,288 --> 00:21:40,457
Ah, my eyes ! I'm blind !
Oh, God, I'm blind !

202
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,503
No, don't !

203
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:51,844
Yo, she-bitch.

204
00:21:52,052 --> 00:21:54,805
- Let's go.

205
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:56,598
Ya-hoo !

206
00:21:56,807 --> 00:21:58,976
Hee-ya !

207
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:02,604
- Hee-ya !

208
00:22:16,326 --> 00:22:18,579
If the Necronomicon fell into
the hands of the Deadites,

209
00:22:18,787 --> 00:22:21,456
all mankind will be consumed
by this evil.

210
00:22:21,665 --> 00:22:25,377
Now will thou
quest for the book ?

211
00:22:37,848 --> 00:22:41,435
That one.

212
00:23:00,036 --> 00:23:02,956
Hee-ya !

213
00:23:06,334 --> 00:23:09,713
Groovy.

214
00:23:21,015 --> 00:23:24,269
What's the matter ?
You raised in a barn ? Shut the door.

215
00:23:24,477 --> 00:23:29,691
Probably was raised in a barn
with all the other primitives.

216
00:23:37,031 --> 00:23:41,494
The wise men say that
thou art The Promised One.

217
00:23:43,538 --> 00:23:47,125
'Tis said that thou wilt journey
for the book to help us,

218
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:49,585
and that thou wilt lead
our people against the evil.

219
00:23:49,794 --> 00:23:55,133
The only reason I'm going
to get the book is to get home.

220
00:23:59,387 --> 00:24:01,764
I believe that thou wilt be
leaving in the morning.

221
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:04,016
Don't touch that, please.
Your primitive intellect...

222
00:24:04,225 --> 00:24:06,102
wouldn't understand
alloys and compositions...

223
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:11,148
and things with
molecular structures in the--

224
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:14,819
What are you
doin' here anyway ?

225
00:24:15,027 --> 00:24:17,530
I wanted to say
that all of my--

226
00:24:17,738 --> 00:24:20,074
all of my hopes and
prayers go with you,

227
00:24:20,282 --> 00:24:23,119
and I made this
for thee.

228
00:24:23,327 --> 00:24:26,747
Good, I could use
a horse blanket.

229
00:24:48,018 --> 00:24:51,563
Gimme some sugar, baby.

230
00:25:54,863 --> 00:25:59,451
Hyah ! Come on, boy !

231
00:25:59,827 --> 00:26:03,205
Hyah !

232
00:26:08,585 --> 00:26:12,589
Hyah !

233
00:26:19,012 --> 00:26:21,181
- Steady now. Whoa.

234
00:26:26,061 --> 00:26:28,522
What ? What is it ?

235
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:31,316
This path will lead you
to an unholy place.

236
00:26:31,525 --> 00:26:36,822
A cemetery. There,
the Necronomicon awaits.

237
00:26:38,782 --> 00:26:42,869
When thou retrievest the book from
its cradle, you must recite the words,

238
00:26:43,078 --> 00:26:45,872
"Klaatu barada nikto."

239
00:26:46,081 --> 00:26:49,668
Klaatu barada nikto.
Okay.

240
00:26:49,876 --> 00:26:51,878
Well, repeat them.

241
00:26:52,087 --> 00:26:55,340
- Klaatu barada nikto.
- Again !

242
00:26:55,549 --> 00:26:58,885
I got it, I got it !
I know your damn words, all right ?

243
00:26:59,094 --> 00:27:01,596
Now you get this straight,
the both of you.

244
00:27:01,805 --> 00:27:04,683
If I get that book,
you send me back.

245
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:07,185
After that,
I'm history. Hyah !

246
00:28:08,767 --> 00:28:10,644
What is it, boy ?

247
00:28:23,865 --> 00:28:26,743
Hyah ! Come on !

248
00:28:34,376 --> 00:28:37,337
Hyah ! Come on !

249
00:28:42,342 --> 00:28:45,261
Aah ! Come on !

250
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:48,598
Come on, you !

251
00:32:19,409 --> 00:32:23,497
Hey, let's scare
this guy good ! Come on.

252
00:32:24,998 --> 00:32:27,000
Ramming speed !

253
00:32:31,505 --> 00:32:34,883
Ooh !

254
00:32:35,091 --> 00:32:37,886
Ready, aim, fire !

255
00:32:38,094 --> 00:32:40,764
- Ooh !
- Get away !

256
00:32:40,972 --> 00:32:42,891
Whoa !

257
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:45,060
- Oh, God ! Oh, no !
- Oh--

258
00:33:00,268 --> 00:33:03,480
- Oh !
- You lousy little--

259
00:33:03,688 --> 00:33:05,774
Oh, no !

260
00:33:05,982 --> 00:33:07,567
Ooh, no ! Oh, my !

261
00:33:07,776 --> 00:33:10,070
Uh, ooh, aah !

262
00:33:10,278 --> 00:33:13,990
- Lift up !
- Oh, ooh-hoo-ha !

263
00:33:14,199 --> 00:33:18,244
- Ooh, aah !

264
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,708
Aah-ha-ha !

265
00:33:29,672 --> 00:33:32,926
Heh heh heh-heh--
Whoa !

266
00:34:57,259 --> 00:34:59,345
## London Bridge
is falling down #

267
00:34:59,553 --> 00:35:02,431
# Falling down #

268
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,434
# Falling down #

269
00:35:05,643 --> 00:35:08,354
- # My fair lady ## Ha !

270
00:35:12,691 --> 00:35:18,947
Ooh !

271
00:35:19,865 --> 00:35:21,700
Is he up ?
How is he ?

272
00:35:21,909 --> 00:35:25,454
Hey,
he's gettin' up.

273
00:35:29,166 --> 00:35:34,421
Hmm,
what a horrible nightmare.

274
00:35:34,796 --> 00:35:38,926
Wait a minute.
Oh, God !

275
00:35:39,134 --> 00:35:41,011
I can't move !

276
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:46,850
Aah !

277
00:35:47,684 --> 00:35:50,228
- And go !
- Open wide.

278
00:35:56,437 --> 00:36:02,818
Geronimo !

279
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:05,029
- Hooray !
- Hooray !

280
00:36:26,552 --> 00:36:28,888
- Ah !

281
00:36:29,096 --> 00:36:33,351
Okay, little fella.
How about some hot chocolate, huh ?

282
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:46,822
How'd you like
the taste of that, huh ?

283
00:36:47,031 --> 00:36:48,949
How'd you like the ta--

284
00:36:52,828 --> 00:36:55,414
Aah, uh, ugh, oh !

285
00:36:55,623 --> 00:36:59,335
Ah ! Oh !

286
00:36:59,501 --> 00:37:03,505
Let me out !

287
00:37:05,633 --> 00:37:09,386
Oh, dear God,
it's growing bigger !

288
00:37:43,444 --> 00:37:47,781
Ooh, ooh, I'm blind.
I'm blind. Bleh.

289
00:37:51,452 --> 00:37:54,747
Yip, yip, yah !

290
00:37:54,955 --> 00:38:00,419
Oh, hey ! Where are you takin' me ?
Uh, oh, ooh !

291
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:21,469
What are you ?

292
00:38:21,677 --> 00:38:23,971
Are you me ?

293
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:38,600
I'm bad Ash,
and you're good Ash.

294
00:38:38,808 --> 00:38:40,643
You're goody
little two-shoes.

295
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:44,856
## You're goody little two-shoes
goody little two-shoes #

296
00:38:45,064 --> 00:38:47,650
# Little goody two-shoes
Little goody two-shoes #

297
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:52,530
# Little goody two-shoes
Little goody two-shoes
Little goody two-shoes #

298
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:56,242
- Ow !

299
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,786
# Little goody two-shoes ##

300
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:06,377
Aah !

301
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:15,970
Good, bad.
I'm the guy with the gun.

302
00:40:30,738 --> 00:40:36,368
That'll teach you.
Yeah, that'll teach you.

303
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,580
You shall never retrieve
the Necronomicon !

304
00:40:39,788 --> 00:40:42,875
You'll die in the graveyard
before you get it !

305
00:40:43,083 --> 00:40:47,713
- What's that you got on your face ?
- Huh ?

306
00:40:47,921 --> 00:40:51,633
I'll come back for you !

307
00:40:57,014 --> 00:41:01,727
- Hyah !

308
00:41:01,894 --> 00:41:05,397
Come on, boy !

309
00:41:12,654 --> 00:41:16,408
Hyah !

310
00:42:46,014 --> 00:42:49,600
Three books ?

311
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,814
Wait a minute.
Hold it.

312
00:42:55,023 --> 00:42:59,527
Nobody said anything
about three books.

313
00:42:59,736 --> 00:43:01,529
L-Like what
am I supposed to do ?

314
00:43:11,738 --> 00:43:18,286
Take one book,
or all books, or, or what ?

315
00:43:18,953 --> 00:43:21,998
Well.

316
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:24,721
Whoa. Wrong book.

317
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,298
Ow !

318
00:45:13,804 --> 00:45:15,639
Aah ! Ooh !

319
00:45:25,148 --> 00:45:27,901
Ooh ! Ooh, you !

320
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:31,822
I'll get back to you.

321
00:45:32,197 --> 00:45:33,031
Well...

322
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,324
Well...

323
00:45:34,533 --> 00:45:37,953
seems fairly obvious.

324
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:46,169
Ooh, wait a minute. The words.
All right, all right, all right.

325
00:45:46,378 --> 00:45:49,798
Say the words.

326
00:45:52,008 --> 00:45:55,178
Klaatu... barada...

327
00:45:55,387 --> 00:45:58,932
Iu--

328
00:46:03,436 --> 00:46:05,272
necktie.

329
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,525
Nectar, n-- nickel.

330
00:46:08,733 --> 00:46:11,319
Noodle.
It's an "N" word.

331
00:46:11,528 --> 00:46:15,615
It's definitely
an "N" word.

332
00:46:16,449 --> 00:46:20,203
It's definitely
an "N" word.

333
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:35,176
Klaatu barada n--

334
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:54,028
Okay, then.
That's it.

335
00:47:03,705 --> 00:47:06,207
Hey. Wait a minute.

336
00:47:06,416 --> 00:47:10,545
Everything's cool.
I said the words. I did !

337
00:47:10,753 --> 00:47:16,384
- Oh ! Oh ! No, wait ! Oh !

338
00:47:27,973 --> 00:47:32,310
You people, seek cover !
To the parapet !

339
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:34,437
Seek your children !

340
00:47:34,646 --> 00:47:38,108
- Steady the horses !

341
00:47:38,316 --> 00:47:41,903
Something's wrong.
Something's amiss.

342
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:17,814
Where'd you go ?
Where'd you g--

343
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:43,464
Oh, oh, aah !

344
00:48:45,675 --> 00:48:47,635
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

345
00:48:50,596 --> 00:48:55,976
Ow ! I'll crush ya !
I'll mash ya into paste, you bony cre--

346
00:49:15,996 --> 00:49:19,416
- Hyah !

347
00:49:32,251 --> 00:49:35,671
I'm through being their garbage boy.
I did my part.

348
00:49:35,879 --> 00:49:39,508
Now I want back,
like in the deal. Hyah !

349
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,138
I... live...

350
00:49:56,995 --> 00:49:58,979
again.

351
00:50:09,196 --> 00:50:13,037
There ! The Promised One !
The Promised One's returned !

352
00:50:13,249 --> 00:50:17,977
Raise the portcullis !

353
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:25,322
Welcome home !
We're saved !

354
00:50:26,555 --> 00:50:30,755
- The Necronomicon !
- Truly he is The Promised One !

355
00:50:30,974 --> 00:50:33,555
- He's brought the Necronomicon !
- How are ya ?

356
00:50:33,773 --> 00:50:36,880
- He's brought the book !
- Yeah, great, great.

357
00:50:37,098 --> 00:50:39,068
- Good boy !
- Get the fuck outta my face !

358
00:50:45,848 --> 00:50:51,010
The Necronomicon, quickly.
Did you bring the Necronomicon ?

359
00:50:51,142 --> 00:50:55,299
- Yeah, it's, it's just that--
- Just what ?

360
00:50:55,342 --> 00:50:59,236
Nothin'.
Here.

361
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:07,549
Now send me back.
Like in the deal.

362
00:51:07,768 --> 00:51:12,843
When you removed the Necronomicon from
the cradle, did you speak the words ?

363
00:51:13,061 --> 00:51:15,862
- Yeah, basically.
- Did you speak the exact words ?

364
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,793
Look, maybe I didn't say every
single, little tiny syllable,

365
00:51:19,011 --> 00:51:22,074
- no, but basically I said 'em, yeah.
- Dung-eating fool !

366
00:51:22,294 --> 00:51:26,099
Thou hast doomed us all !
When thou misspoke the words,

367
00:51:26,318 --> 00:51:28,331
the army
of the dead awoke !

368
00:51:28,549 --> 00:51:30,868
Now, whoa, whoa,
right there, spinach chin.

369
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:34,324
You said you could clean this mess up
once you got that book.

370
00:51:34,543 --> 00:51:38,175
You said there was a passage that could
get rid of this thing and send me back.

371
00:51:38,392 --> 00:51:40,886
It's true, the book still possesses
the power to send you back,

372
00:51:41,106 --> 00:51:42,987
but to us
it is useless !

373
00:51:43,205 --> 00:51:45,787
The evil has a terrible hunger
for the Necronomicon,

374
00:51:46,005 --> 00:51:48,937
and it will come here
to get it.

375
00:51:49,155 --> 00:51:51,824
We had a deal.

376
00:51:52,043 --> 00:51:54,887
You wanted the damn book,
I got it for ya.

377
00:51:55,106 --> 00:51:57,162
I did my part,
now you send me back.

378
00:51:57,381 --> 00:52:00,050
Very well.
As we are men of our word,

379
00:52:00,268 --> 00:52:04,293
we shall honor
our bargain.

380
00:52:04,513 --> 00:52:08,581
The wise men shall return you
to your own time.

381
00:52:08,799 --> 00:52:10,638
Yeah ?

382
00:52:10,855 --> 00:52:13,131
- I thought he was the one.
- Yeah, right.

383
00:52:13,350 --> 00:52:15,319
'Cause that
was the deal.

384
00:52:15,537 --> 00:52:17,987
So when do you think
we can...

385
00:52:18,206 --> 00:52:21,138
start with all
the thing and the--

386
00:52:21,355 --> 00:52:23,282
He's nothin'
but a traitor, he is !

387
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,382
When do you
think we can start...

388
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:29,187
with all the, uh,
ceremony and, uh--

389
00:52:31,407 --> 00:52:33,331
Agh ! Wretched excuse
for a man !

390
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:38,537
The wise men were fools
to trust in you.

391
00:52:38,757 --> 00:52:40,638
I knew he couldn't be trusted.

392
00:52:40,856 --> 00:52:43,657
We put our trust in him.

393
00:52:43,874 --> 00:52:46,763
I still believe
that thou wilt help us.

394
00:52:46,981 --> 00:52:52,670
Oh, Sheila,
don't you get it ? It's over.

395
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:56,826
I didn't have
what it took.

396
00:52:57,131 --> 00:53:00,851
So long.

397
00:53:03,169 --> 00:53:05,050
But what of the things
that we've shared ?

398
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:15,813
What of all the sweet words
that you spoke in private ?

399
00:53:16,032 --> 00:53:18,612
Aw, well--

400
00:53:18,832 --> 00:53:23,032
Well, that's just what we call
"pillow talk," baby. That's all.

401
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:26,838
It was more than that.

402
00:53:27,188 --> 00:53:29,813
I still have faith
in thee.

403
00:53:30,032 --> 00:53:35,369
I still believe that thou
wilt stay and save us. I--

404
00:53:39,307 --> 00:53:43,244
Coward !

405
00:53:44,251 --> 00:53:46,307
- Look there ! A demon !

406
00:54:03,632 --> 00:54:06,783
Ash ! Help me !

407
00:54:07,001 --> 00:54:09,627
Sheila !

408
00:54:13,476 --> 00:54:17,152
Yaaah !

409
00:54:21,002 --> 00:54:25,683
- Shoot the bloody thing !
- Hold your arms ! You'll hit the girl !

410
00:54:29,363 --> 00:54:33,126
Uh, me sword !

411
00:54:33,258 --> 00:54:36,058
Yaaah !

412
00:54:36,277 --> 00:54:37,939
Damn you !

413
00:54:56,444 --> 00:55:01,270
Dig, damn you !
Dig faster !

414
00:55:01,483 --> 00:55:04,559
I shall command every
worm-infested son-of-a-bitch...

415
00:55:04,771 --> 00:55:06,608
- that ever died in battle !
- Thank you, sir !

416
00:55:06,822 --> 00:55:08,915
- You there, handsomely now.
- Aye, my liege.

417
00:55:09,128 --> 00:55:11,606
We shall storm their castle
and get my book !

418
00:55:11,818 --> 00:55:16,174
Hoist,
you damnable varlets !

419
00:55:18,993 --> 00:55:22,709
Welcome back
to the land of the living.

420
00:55:22,921 --> 00:55:26,594
Now pick up a shovel
and get digging !

421
00:55:26,809 --> 00:55:32,019
- Bring on the wench !

422
00:55:42,268 --> 00:55:47,564
- Gimme some sugar, baby.

423
00:55:47,564 --> 00:55:50,169
Well.

424
00:55:50,382 --> 00:55:54,866
Now, ain't you
a sweet little thing ?

425
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,556
Don't touch me,
you foul thing !

426
00:56:04,771 --> 00:56:06,992
Come on.

427
00:56:07,205 --> 00:56:11,006
That's it.

428
00:56:20,501 --> 00:56:24,643
We got plans for you, girly-girl.
Move !

429
00:56:25,198 --> 00:56:29,127
Have you lost your bones,
you decomposed gobs ? Get thee hence !

430
00:56:38,396 --> 00:56:41,896
A scout approaches !

431
00:56:47,065 --> 00:56:50,097
- Whoa !
- Hey, get his horse.

432
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:52,147
Arise.

433
00:56:52,359 --> 00:56:54,238
My lord, an army of the dead
gather in the wilderness.

434
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:56,758
- They approach the castle.
- How far from here?

435
00:56:56,973 --> 00:56:58,338
But two days' ride.

436
00:56:58,552 --> 00:57:00,474
These winged ones
are only the first of them.

437
00:57:00,688 --> 00:57:02,567
Perhaps we should leave
as soon as possible.

438
00:57:02,781 --> 00:57:04,616
- We could be safe in the mountains.
- Yes, the mountains.

439
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:07,264
- We must flee !
- It is written. It has been foretold.

440
00:57:07,478 --> 00:57:09,699
- They'll take our souls.
They'll swallow our souls.
- I'm afraid !

441
00:57:09,911 --> 00:57:13,115
- I don't want to die !

442
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:17,771
That's it.
Go ahead and run.

443
00:57:17,983 --> 00:57:20,845
Run home
and cry to mama !

444
00:57:21,059 --> 00:57:26,482
Me ?
I'm through runnin' !

445
00:57:27,124 --> 00:57:30,411
I say we stay here
and fight it out.

446
00:57:30,625 --> 00:57:35,152
Are all men from
the future loudmouthed braggarts ?

447
00:57:35,365 --> 00:57:40,319
Nope. Just me, baby.
Just me.

448
00:57:40,533 --> 00:57:44,974
How will we fight an army of the dead
at our castle walls ?

449
00:57:45,188 --> 00:57:47,920
How will you fight that ?
More words ?

450
00:57:48,135 --> 00:57:49,971
Most of our people
have already fled.

451
00:57:50,184 --> 00:57:52,832
We are but 60 men.

452
00:57:53,045 --> 00:57:58,085
Then we'll get Henry the Red
and his men to fight with us.

453
00:57:59,323 --> 00:58:05,345
Now... who's with me ?

454
00:58:17,712 --> 00:58:21,343
I'll stand by ya.

455
00:58:21,812 --> 00:58:24,119
You can count on my steel.

456
00:58:24,331 --> 00:58:26,212
I'll offer up my courage.

457
00:58:26,423 --> 00:58:30,054
- Me sword's by his side.
- I'm with you !

458
00:58:30,268 --> 00:58:32,788
- I'll bend my bow to your will, sir.
- And mine !

459
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,357
We'll stay !

460
00:58:37,571 --> 00:58:40,646
Hail ! Hail !
Hail ! Hail !

461
00:58:40,859 --> 00:58:47,820
Hail ! Hail ! Hail !

462
00:58:55,636 --> 00:58:57,557
Well, my dear,

463
00:58:57,771 --> 00:59:01,956
say hello to the boys.

464
00:59:05,201 --> 00:59:10,669
- There's a sight for sore bones.

465
00:59:13,445 --> 00:59:15,878
I may be bad,

466
00:59:16,092 --> 00:59:19,467
but I feel... good.

467
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:22,371
- Who rules ?
- To you, my lord.

468
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:24,462
You, sir. To the castle.

469
00:59:24,676 --> 00:59:28,264
The castle !

470
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:30,954
Hurry up now.

471
00:59:31,168 --> 00:59:33,601
The castle ! Let's push.

472
00:59:33,816 --> 00:59:38,299
Heave-ho.
Good. Yeah.

473
01:00:37,705 --> 01:00:39,669
Ha ! Hoo !

474
01:00:39,883 --> 01:00:41,718
Hai-ya !

475
01:00:41,933 --> 01:00:45,220
Ha ! Hoo ! Hai-ya !

476
01:00:45,435 --> 01:00:48,936
Yeah !

477
01:01:39,192 --> 01:01:42,658
They're coming !
The Deadites approach !

478
01:02:16,931 --> 01:02:20,560
There's so damn
many of 'em.

479
01:02:22,183 --> 01:02:24,190
-

480
01:02:24,404 --> 01:02:29,529
-

481
01:02:32,817 --> 01:02:34,695
-

482
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:37,429
-

483
01:03:15,508 --> 01:03:19,566
Battle stations ! All right, get those
rocks up, mister, on the double !

484
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:26,185
Ready the catapults !
By God, let's give 'em what for.

485
01:03:33,830 --> 01:03:35,667
And halt !

486
01:03:35,879 --> 01:03:41,048
- Company, halt !
- Company, halt !

487
01:03:46,941 --> 01:03:49,803
I'll rip his balls off.

488
01:04:23,156 --> 01:04:27,640
-

489
01:04:27,939 --> 01:04:29,946
-

490
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:15,978
My lord, we are positioned
on both fronts.

491
01:05:16,192 --> 01:05:19,609
Fine, fine, fine.
Where are they keeping my book ?

492
01:05:19,821 --> 01:05:22,683
There, my lord,
beyond the wall.

493
01:05:22,897 --> 01:05:26,186
The parapet. That would be
the most likely place.

494
01:05:34,399 --> 01:05:38,884
Right. Bring me forth
into that castle !

495
01:05:39,096 --> 01:05:41,958
- Forward !
- Forward !

496
01:05:42,172 --> 01:05:47,083
Cry havoc and let loose
the dogs of war !

497
01:05:47,296 --> 01:05:49,944
To the castle !

498
01:05:50,158 --> 01:05:53,702
Fly, mate ! Fly !

499
01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:58,315
Death to the mortals !

500
01:06:00,596 --> 01:06:02,748
Arrows.

501
01:06:21,962 --> 01:06:25,677
Torch boy !

502
01:07:00,356 --> 01:07:03,259
Steady.

503
01:07:08,769 --> 01:07:12,441
Fire !

504
01:07:13,552 --> 01:07:18,762
- Advance, you beasts, advance !

505
01:07:26,193 --> 01:07:30,421
Oh ! Oh !

506
01:07:31,873 --> 01:07:36,186
Yeah, baby !

507
01:07:49,646 --> 01:07:53,787
- All right !

508
01:08:14,002 --> 01:08:18,358
Sire, there's a second division
approaching from the south.

509
01:08:18,571 --> 01:08:23,141
Ram the gate !

510
01:08:25,916 --> 01:08:27,455
Catapults.

511
01:08:27,667 --> 01:08:29,846
Catapults out !

512
01:08:38,216 --> 01:08:40,607
Yeah !

513
01:08:51,821 --> 01:08:55,836
Fire !

514
01:08:59,508 --> 01:09:02,369
Look there !

515
01:09:06,342 --> 01:09:09,374
Yeah !

516
01:09:09,587 --> 01:09:13,004
- Seek cover !
- Watch out !

517
01:09:13,217 --> 01:09:16,846
- Make way !

518
01:09:25,901 --> 01:09:27,780
Oh !

519
01:09:27,994 --> 01:09:30,684
Oh, you miserable
bags of bones !

520
01:09:30,898 --> 01:09:33,801
Pick yourselves up
and sally fo...

521
01:09:36,065 --> 01:09:38,072
Sally for--

522
01:09:38,286 --> 01:09:41,831
Sally forth.

523
01:09:44,137 --> 01:09:46,698
Come on,
you miserable wretches.

524
01:09:46,913 --> 01:09:49,475
Lower.

525
01:09:49,688 --> 01:09:53,960
Heave !

526
01:09:57,718 --> 01:10:01,433
Forward !

527
01:10:01,646 --> 01:10:06,002
Buttress the door, now !

528
01:10:15,184 --> 01:10:19,370
Hold fast !

529
01:10:21,334 --> 01:10:23,982
- Back !
- Stone these creatures !

530
01:10:24,195 --> 01:10:28,039
Damn you !

531
01:10:28,978 --> 01:10:31,029
Ooh, that's gotta hurt.

532
01:10:31,242 --> 01:10:33,720
Go, you creatures !
Arrows !

533
01:10:33,932 --> 01:10:37,434
Load !
Fire !

534
01:10:40,081 --> 01:10:43,499
- Heave ! Put your...

535
01:10:43,713 --> 01:10:46,916
backbones into it.

536
01:11:18,128 --> 01:11:20,435
We've broken through !
The castle is ours !

537
01:11:25,987 --> 01:11:30,685
Kill the mortals !

538
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:36,578
- Get it achieved and fast !

539
01:11:50,373 --> 01:11:54,514
Their ranks are broken !
Have at them !

540
01:11:54,813 --> 01:11:59,938
Ha ! Hoo ! Hai-ya !
Ha ! Hoo ! Hai-ya !

541
01:12:20,362 --> 01:12:23,437
Pull back !
Man the parapet !

542
01:12:23,651 --> 01:12:25,487
Protect the book.

543
01:12:25,701 --> 01:12:29,544
God save us all.

544
01:12:43,088 --> 01:12:46,206
Say hello
to the 21st century. Yeah !

545
01:12:59,274 --> 01:13:02,605
Come on !
I got plenty for everybody !

546
01:13:02,819 --> 01:13:04,997
Look out !

547
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:08,071
- Whoo !

548
01:13:10,848 --> 01:13:14,905
- Bye-bye.

549
01:13:15,503 --> 01:13:19,262
It's the one in the cart we want !
Get him !

550
01:13:19,475 --> 01:13:24,001
- Yaaah !

551
01:13:29,895 --> 01:13:31,689
Yaaaaah !

552
01:13:54,152 --> 01:13:57,142
Sheila ?

553
01:14:41,032 --> 01:14:43,807
- We've secured the courtyard, my lord.

554
01:14:44,022 --> 01:14:47,523
Excellent.

555
01:14:59,139 --> 01:15:02,685
Ooh ! Hey ! Look out !

556
01:15:37,364 --> 01:15:40,397
- Hey, you're mine, sweetie.

557
01:15:40,611 --> 01:15:44,112
Get off of her !

558
01:15:46,846 --> 01:15:48,682
Gotcha !

559
01:15:48,895 --> 01:15:52,355
Damn you !

560
01:15:58,978 --> 01:16:02,053
- My lord.
- Stay with the book.

561
01:16:02,265 --> 01:16:06,623
The book's where we are.

568
01:16:23,390 --> 01:16:25,524
Oops !

569
01:16:25,738 --> 01:16:27,093
Hello !

571
01:16:37,524 --> 01:16:40,283
The book is mine.

572
01:16:53,312 --> 01:16:54,490
I'll cut your gizzard out.

573
01:16:55,703 --> 01:16:57,205
- Hey, where'd he go ?

574
01:17:05,557 --> 01:17:08,462
Come to papa.

575
01:17:08,675 --> 01:17:12,263
Get him !

576
01:17:41,587 --> 01:17:43,534
Oh, you crazy bitch,
get off of me !

577
01:17:48,748 --> 01:17:52,249
Ha !

578
01:17:55,026 --> 01:17:58,528
Right.

579
01:18:03,268 --> 01:18:06,129
You found me beautiful once.

580
01:18:06,344 --> 01:18:09,632
Honey, you got real ugly.

581
01:18:27,013 --> 01:18:30,514
There we are.

582
01:18:37,178 --> 01:18:39,910
So you wanna
play rough, eh ?

583
01:18:40,125 --> 01:18:44,266
Okay.

584
01:18:44,908 --> 01:18:49,818
Oh.

585
01:18:50,374 --> 01:18:54,943
All right, all right.

586
01:18:55,755 --> 01:19:00,195
Prepare to die !

587
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:20,887
You're going down !

588
01:19:21,101 --> 01:19:25,116
- I'm goin' up.
- I'm comin' for ya.

589
01:19:41,759 --> 01:19:46,244
Come on !

590
01:19:58,629 --> 01:20:00,551
- Oops. Excuse me.
- Come on.

591
01:20:00,763 --> 01:20:03,753
All right !

592
01:20:03,968 --> 01:20:09,264
You're pissin' me off,
you ugly son of a bitch !

593
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:31,256
I'll spoil
those good looks.

594
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:35,185
Back-stabber !

595
01:20:44,705 --> 01:20:48,165
Hold still !

596
01:20:58,413 --> 01:21:00,934
Tallyho !

597
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:11,101
- We can't hold the battlements!

598
01:21:11,314 --> 01:21:14,304
We will hold !
We must protect the book !

599
01:21:43,074 --> 01:21:44,953
I got a bone
to pick with you.

600
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:49,265
Come on.

601
01:21:54,091 --> 01:21:57,680
Slice that gizzard open.

602
01:22:12,968 --> 01:22:16,896
Now you're mine.

603
01:22:17,366 --> 01:22:21,851
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

604
01:23:06,712 --> 01:23:10,855
At last, the book.

605
01:23:14,742 --> 01:23:17,006
I possess the Necronomicon.

606
01:23:17,219 --> 01:23:20,807
I've crushed your pathetic army.
Now I'll have my vengeance.

607
01:24:03,019 --> 01:24:06,736
Buckle up, bonehead,
'cause you're goin' for a ride.

608
01:24:06,948 --> 01:24:10,749
Huh ?

609
01:24:22,023 --> 01:24:26,850
Victory's ours !

610
01:24:25,404 --> 01:24:31,042
- Retreat ! Retreat !
- Let's get the hell out of here !

611
01:24:48,452 --> 01:24:50,289
- Oh.
- Tricky ones, they are.

612
01:24:50,502 --> 01:24:52,766
If it's a fight you want--

613
01:24:52,979 --> 01:24:58,019
Watch 'em, lads.
They're an untrust worthy lot.

614
01:25:48,399 --> 01:25:50,277
Move yourself, lad !

615
01:25:50,491 --> 01:25:52,540
- Your hand, man. Godspeed !
- Hey, Henry. Yeah, nice goin'.

616
01:25:52,754 --> 01:25:54,590
- My lady.
- Arthur.

617
01:25:54,804 --> 01:25:57,964
- Well won, my friend.
- We've won the day.

618
01:25:58,178 --> 01:26:01,808
- Yeah !
- Yeah !

619
01:26:05,012 --> 01:26:10,691
We're brothers
and a new kingdom shall be born !

620
01:26:12,185 --> 01:26:15,345
The book tells us that each drop
allows a man to sleep for a century

621
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:19,787
swallow six drops

622
01:26:20,001 --> 01:26:24,399
though will awake in your own time.

624
01:27:00,871 --> 01:27:04,373
Hyah !

625
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Six drops.

626
01:30:33,437 --> 01:30:36,000
I slept too long.
