1
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:35,180
Take them into the forest now.

2
00:02:01,372 --> 00:02:03,416
You stay here.

3
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,460
I'll be back soon.

4
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:08,546
- Wait!
- No!

5
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:10,340
I said, stay here!

6
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:18,890
Father! Wait!

7
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:22,620
Help us! Please!

8
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:24,184
Hello! Is anybody there?

9
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:47,705
Eat!

10
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,126
- Eat!

11
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:02,553
Eat!

12
00:05:04,681 --> 00:05:06,057
Eat!

13
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:13,231
This oven's not hot enough!

14
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:14,357
More wood!

15
00:05:43,428 --> 00:05:44,595
What?

16
00:06:09,287 --> 00:06:11,372
Is it hot enough for you now, bitch?

17
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:20,214
<i>My sister and I
never saw our parents again.</i>

18
00:06:21,174 --> 00:06:23,259
<i>It was just the two of us.</i>

19
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:26,804
<i>But we learned a couple of things
while trapped in that house.</i>

20
00:06:27,972 --> 00:06:31,142
<i>One: Never walk into a house
made of candy.</i>

21
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:37,523
<i>And two: If you're gonna kill a witch,</i>

22
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:38,900
<i>set her ass on fire.</i>

23
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:09,050
Fresh milk! Fresh milk

24
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:13,387
for the children!
Keep your children healthy! Fresh milk!

25
00:09:14,764 --> 00:09:17,600
After weeks of living in fear,

26
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:22,688
we have finally caught the one
responsible for all this terror!

27
00:09:22,772 --> 00:09:27,443
For crimes against
the city and people of Augsburg,

28
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:33,866
and for consorting with
the spawn of Satan,

29
00:09:35,243 --> 00:09:39,789
I hereby accuse this woman

30
00:09:40,957 --> 00:09:44,418
of the craft of witchery!

31
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:47,380
Burn her! Burn her!

32
00:09:49,257 --> 00:09:50,591
Behold

33
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:53,552
the eyes of the demon.

34
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:57,223
Go to hell.

35
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:06,983
Order!

36
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:08,484
Order!

37
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:13,739
Berringer,

38
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:16,534
this is still my town.

39
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:20,663
Listen to me.

40
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:24,500
As your mayor, I know only too well

41
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:29,046
that many of you
have lost precious loved ones to this

42
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:33,009
witch plague,
but we can't just burn this woman.

43
00:10:33,092 --> 00:10:35,136
We first need evidence.

44
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:36,429
We can't just have...

45
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:39,724
You know a witch when you see one!

46
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:43,894
They ride at night
and they make pacts with the devil!

47
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:48,524
This woman will burn!

48
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:51,068
Burn her! Burn her!

49
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:02,038
Let the girl go
or I'm gonna blow your sheriff's brains

50
00:11:02,121 --> 00:11:04,248
all over these fucking hillbillies.

51
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:08,169
Move. Go on.

52
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:10,671
Let her go. Go over there.

53
00:11:10,755 --> 00:11:11,797
Check her.

54
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:15,092
What's your name?

55
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,595
What's your name?

56
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:20,389
- Mina.
- Don't worry.

57
00:11:20,765 --> 00:11:24,435
When a woman truly deals in witchcraft,
she cannot hide it.

58
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:29,315
A nasty rot sets in. It shows in her teeth,

59
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:31,067
in her skin and her eyes.

60
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:34,278
This is not a witch. This woman's clean.

61
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:40,409
I'm sure your sheriff was only trying
to protect you good people.

62
00:11:40,493 --> 00:11:42,828
But your mayor has done
a very smart thing.

63
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:45,915
He hired us.

64
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:48,042
My name is Gretel,

65
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,336
and this is my brother, Hansel.

66
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:53,756
We know that many
of your children have gone missing.

67
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,218
But killing an innocent woman
will not bring them back.

68
00:11:57,301 --> 00:11:59,387
Go home! We don't want you here!

69
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,971
We don't want more evil in Augsburg!

70
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:04,225
Well, evil is upon you,
whether you like it or not.

71
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:07,353
Now if your children are still alive,

72
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:11,982
we will find them.
But if anyone harms this woman,

73
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:15,236
you're gonna have me to deal with.

74
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:17,238
Now go home!

75
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:19,156
Go!

76
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:30,751
I guess you're free to go.

77
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:33,462
Thank you,

78
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:36,674
Hansel.

79
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:39,176
You're welcome.

80
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:43,889
What the hell do you think
you're doing? Huh?

81
00:12:43,973 --> 00:12:47,601
That woman is a suspect in my custody.
You can't just come here...

82
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:51,021
Any man with half a brain
could see that she was not a witch.

83
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:52,731
Now listen, Sheriff.

84
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:54,608
Hansel and Gretel
have been brought here...

85
00:12:54,692 --> 00:12:56,694
You better listen!

86
00:12:57,862 --> 00:13:01,240
I'm not going to have this bitch
and her scoundrel of a brother

87
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:03,242
coming into my town,

88
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:07,204
telling me what to do.

89
00:13:13,878 --> 00:13:15,713
Don't!

90
00:13:16,297 --> 00:13:17,798
Just don't.

91
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:25,598
Come on. Let's get you started.

92
00:13:26,724 --> 00:13:30,269
<i>There's been reports of
a strange cottage in the north forest.</i>

93
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,314
<i>Locals won't go near the place.</i>

94
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:37,234
<i>A good place to start the investigation.</i>

95
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,751
Move!

96
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:39,898
Gretel!

97
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:03,130
She looks angry.

98
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:05,716
Yeah.

99
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:08,469
A face like that, I'd be angry, too.

100
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:12,640
- Would you shut up?

101
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:16,018
<i>That witch we found
was a dead end, Mayor.</i>

102
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:17,770
<i>No trace of any kids. I'm sorry.</i>

103
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:19,688
But we found this.

104
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:24,693
That is called the Blood Moon, Mayor.

105
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:26,945
An eclipse of the moon.

106
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:30,115
It happens once in a generation
and is a night most holy to witches.

107
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:32,201
Oh, my God.

108
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,911
When?

109
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:36,914
According to this,
three nights from now.

110
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:39,458
There's no doubt in my mind
that all this is connected.

111
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,502
Children being taken in these numbers

112
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:43,629
from the roads and fields
so close to town.

113
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:47,424
A witch does not come out
in the open like that.

114
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:48,967
Not unless she has to.

115
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:54,431
Witch activity
has been increasing lately.

116
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:57,518
More sightings,
animal slaughter, Sabbaths.

117
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:00,104
It seems the coming of the Blood Moon

118
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:03,440
is dragging every damned witch
from their dark hiding place.

119
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:06,443
So,

120
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:08,529
it seems like a good thing

121
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:10,572
that you brought us here,
doesn't it, Mayor?

122
00:17:11,824 --> 00:17:13,075
Half your money now.

123
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:17,287
The rest when the children
are brought back alive.

124
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:20,541
Oh, there he is, right on time.

125
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:23,460
This is Jackson.
He knows these woods inside and out.

126
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:25,963
And he'll take you to where
the last sightings were.

127
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:28,549
Yeah. We can be there in a few hours.

128
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:31,301
Not at night. It's too dangerous.

129
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:32,553
We'll leave in the morning.

130
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:34,638
Yeah, she's right.
It's much too dangerous.

131
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:39,059
So, any place
we can get a drink in this hellhole?

132
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:46,692
Shut up!

133
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:49,862
The last one
they took was a boy.

134
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:54,158
Less than two days ago,
so the scent is still fresh.

135
00:17:55,534 --> 00:18:00,497
100 shilling for every child
you return alive.

136
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:02,541
You better be fast

137
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,086
before our mayor's witch hunters

138
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,380
rob this town blind.

139
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:10,174
You leave tonight.

140
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:15,429
In witch country at night?

141
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:16,680
You must be out of your mind.

142
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,489
Not until you finish the job.

143
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:38,994
Thank you, Wolfgang.

144
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,204
I'm telling you,

145
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:24,748
we should put the fire out.

146
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:26,113
We're hunting witches,

147
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:29,837
not bears. And we have to eat.

148
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,823
Such beautiful creatures.

149
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:02,744
Are they yours?

150
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:05,289
Yes, ma'am.

151
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:09,334
Why have you come here?

152
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:13,964
To the dark of the forest?

153
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:17,384
A child was taken, ma'am.

154
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:22,431
We're here to find him
and take him back.

155
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:26,435
There are no children here.

156
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:31,231
Here...

157
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:34,401
There's only death!

158
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:37,738
- Witch!

159
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:39,781
Fools!

160
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:49,833
This is my land!

161
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:00,427
How dare you?

162
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:19,029
Please?

163
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:20,864
Hmm...

164
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:23,116
Please, God... No.

165
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,744
There's no use in praying, my friend.

166
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:32,042
Even your God knows better
than to come here.

167
00:21:52,688 --> 00:21:55,315
So we got this witch
on the ground, right?

168
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:59,069
And her eyes, they start rolling back
in her head. They're glowing red.

169
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:01,279
She's trying to put
a Soul Searcher spell on me, you see.

170
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:03,865
So I slap her and rip out her tongue.

171
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:08,829
And she starts pissing, starts pissing
everywhere, right?

172
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:11,331
But a witch's piss,
it's the worst, you see,

173
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:14,626
because it actually burns the ground.
It's like acid.

174
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:19,214
Although, in small doses,
it does cure poison ivy, insect bites.

175
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:21,258
I'm getting way off the subject, aren't I?

176
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:23,969
I've got to get back to my friends.

177
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:30,934
What are you looking at?

178
00:22:31,435 --> 00:22:34,187
There have been
abductions here and here,

179
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:35,605
on both sides of the river.

180
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:37,649
And on this last one,

181
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:40,027
we believe a troll was involved.

182
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,320
- A troll?
- Trolls are extra.

183
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:46,033
Hey, so what's wrong with the girls
in this place, huh?

184
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:47,367
I mean, correct me if I'm wrong,

185
00:22:47,451 --> 00:22:49,786
but aren't bar wenches
supposed to be easy?

186
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:52,956
- It's really unusual.
- Yes, it is unusual.

187
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:54,082
Look at this one.

188
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,626
A father and three children attacked.

189
00:22:57,294 --> 00:22:59,755
One child was taken,
but she didn't touch the other two.

190
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:01,548
- Uh-oh.
- That's weird.

191
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:02,716
That's so weird.

192
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,594
- It is strange. It is strange, okay!
- Yeah, yeah.

193
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:07,387
Then again,
we hunt witches for a living.

194
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:08,555
What's normal, really?

195
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:11,558
Excuse me. Hansel and Gretel?

196
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:13,477
Oh, my God, I can't believe you're here.

197
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,395
I'm Ben. Benjamin Walser.

198
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:18,065
I am really quite a fan of your work.

199
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:19,232
That's great.

200
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:21,068
It's nice to meet you, Benjamin.

201
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:22,778
Listen, if it's not too much trouble,

202
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:24,571
- would you please sign...
- Oh, no...

203
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:26,406
Okay.

204
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,991
- Oh, my.

205
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:30,577
Yeah, that's from when you
found the Fox Witch of Antwerp

206
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,787
- and sank her in the moat.
- Oh!

207
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:34,748
And this one's from the
Secret Witch Ring of Belsen.

208
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:37,667
When they tried to put a gate to
hell under the courthouse.

209
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:40,432
I mean, you guys, you certainly
taught those witches a thing or two.

210
00:23:40,504 --> 00:23:41,588
Wow.

211
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:44,591
- This is amazing.
- And, uh, weird.

212
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:46,426
- A little creepy.
- Yeah...

213
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,095
You really keep all this stuff.

214
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:49,179
All right, well...

215
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:51,890
I just have so many questions.
Do you mind?

216
00:23:51,973 --> 00:23:53,517
- You know, we have...
- Oh, no, no.

217
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,268
- You go ahead.
- All right, um...

218
00:23:56,895 --> 00:23:59,981
Okay. Um, how do you best kill a witch?

219
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:01,149
Hansel?

220
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:05,278
Uh, cutting off their heads tends to work.

221
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:06,613
Ripping out their hearts.

222
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:08,490
And skinning them is also nice.

223
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:10,534
Yeah, but burning is the best way.

224
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:12,536
'Cause that's the only way to be safe.

225
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:15,205
- Burning, yeah, of course.
- Burn them all.

226
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:18,041
Oh, is it true that
witches can't harm you?

227
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:21,795
Well, no, that is horseshit, son.

228
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:23,547
Their magic doesn't work on us.

229
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:26,258
And they haven't killed us, yet.

230
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:27,702
Oh, do you think that's because of

231
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:30,053
the witch that you burned
when you were children?

232
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:32,472
I guess that's how
it all started for you guys.

233
00:24:32,556 --> 00:24:34,766
I mean, is that how
you became witch hunters?

234
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:35,976
How did you get your guns?

235
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:37,310
- How did you get your weapons?
- Okay, okay.

236
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:40,272
There's lots of things to do.
You're a really nice kid,

237
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:42,482
but we have a town under attack.

238
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,530
She killed them!

239
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:52,993
She killed them all.

240
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:55,412
Who killed what?

241
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:57,164
The witch!

242
00:24:58,165 --> 00:25:00,208
She killed the trackers. All of them.

243
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:03,795
She gave me a message.

244
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:06,298
For you all.

245
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:29,738
The Curse of Hunger
for Crawling Things.

246
00:25:33,617 --> 00:25:35,202
I fucking hate that one.

247
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:37,787
That was awesome.

248
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:56,473
The witch hunters are near,
I can smell their stench.

249
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:58,642
Your plan's working.

250
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:01,311
Did you bring the preparations?

251
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:02,979
Of course, Muriel.

252
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:06,441
Oiled frogs,
fattened on possum maggots.

253
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:08,485
And Carpathian nightshade,

254
00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:10,695
deadly to the touch, most rare.

255
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:12,489
And, Muriel,

256
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:18,161
we brought something to test it with.

257
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:16,553
Open your mouth.

258
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:18,930
Open!

259
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,895
Swallow, little pig!

260
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:29,816
He's ready.

261
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:56,426
It's working.

262
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:07,020
It's not even warm.

263
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:10,065
Muriel, this could change everything.

264
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:13,610
It will change everything.

265
00:28:14,277 --> 00:28:17,781
We will be invincible.

266
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:19,366
Ow, Ow! Take it out.

267
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:22,285
Take it out! Take it out!

268
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:26,873
It's of no use if it doesn't last.

269
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:28,583
I can make it last.

270
00:28:31,294 --> 00:28:33,421
Forever.

271
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,325
Where are we going?

272
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:04,661
We're almost there.

273
00:29:14,003 --> 00:29:15,422
Hey.

274
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:17,507
Hey.

275
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:20,176
I just had this really weird dream.

276
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:23,263
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

277
00:29:23,346 --> 00:29:24,472
About what?

278
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:31,104
I think it was about our mother.

279
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:34,858
We don't talk about that.

280
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,445
Go to sleep.

281
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:14,397
What do you think? Boy, girl?

282
00:30:14,856 --> 00:30:17,442
Okay. Here you go. I'll take this.

283
00:30:22,697 --> 00:30:24,491
A little small for you, maybe.

284
00:30:25,074 --> 00:30:26,784
Oh, hello.

285
00:30:27,368 --> 00:30:29,370
Uh, no, this, this is...

286
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:31,539
This is not for me.

287
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:35,752
Um, so, how goes the witch hunting?

288
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:38,505
It's good. Witch hunting's good.

289
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,677
It's strange being
among these people.

290
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:45,803
Yeah?

291
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:48,681
If you hadn't come,
they'd have burned me alive.

292
00:30:49,724 --> 00:30:51,559
Yeah, well, I probably
would have let them,

293
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:53,603
but I'm old-fashioned that way.

294
00:30:53,728 --> 00:30:56,731
My sister, however,
requires a little bit more evidence

295
00:30:56,814 --> 00:30:58,191
before someone gets roasted.

296
00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:03,363
Have you ever come across a witch

297
00:31:03,446 --> 00:31:04,606
that you didn't want to kill?

298
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:06,032
No, never.

299
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,868
The only good witch is a dead witch.

300
00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:14,958
- Can you hold this?
- Mmm-hmm.

301
00:31:22,966 --> 00:31:24,133
Are you all right?

302
00:31:24,467 --> 00:31:25,635
Yeah.

303
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:30,848
When I was a kid,

304
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:34,060
a witch made me eat
so much candy, I got sick.

305
00:31:35,186 --> 00:31:38,856
Something happened to me.
I have to take this injection

306
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:41,526
every few hours or else I die.

307
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:44,821
You have the sugar sickness.

308
00:31:47,198 --> 00:31:50,076
I actually know a thing or two about it
if you ever need any help...

309
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,828
It's all right.

310
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:53,621
- So...
- I'm fine.

311
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:03,339
It was good seeing you.

312
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:04,507
Yeah.

313
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:06,676
You're very handsome.

314
00:32:07,385 --> 00:32:09,470
And no man in this town
will walk with me.

315
00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:13,349
And you have

316
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,143
my pumpkin.

317
00:32:19,355 --> 00:32:21,274
I... I have to go.

318
00:32:22,191 --> 00:32:23,359
- See you.
- Mmm-hmm.

319
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:41,669
It'll all be perfect.

320
00:32:41,753 --> 00:32:45,798
Daddy! Daddy,
please help me! I'm lost!

321
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:51,095
Daddy, please!

322
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:57,393
Please help me! I'm lost!

323
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:02,940
Daddy, I'm scared!
I'm alone in the woods!

324
00:33:03,608 --> 00:33:05,943
I can help you, little boy.

325
00:33:06,444 --> 00:33:07,987
Sweet little boy.

326
00:33:08,613 --> 00:33:09,853
- Please help me!

327
00:33:10,615 --> 00:33:12,575
Daddy! I'm scared!

328
00:33:12,742 --> 00:33:14,577
I'm alone in the woods!

329
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:19,290
<i>Please help...</i>

330
00:33:26,255 --> 00:33:27,965
You move, you die.

331
00:33:30,468 --> 00:33:31,719
Get her wand.

332
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:36,159
Will you stop that?

333
00:35:13,738 --> 00:35:15,239
Ooh.

334
00:35:15,364 --> 00:35:16,949
I like your toys.

335
00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:22,497
They have brought
a live witch into my office!

336
00:35:22,622 --> 00:35:26,375
They need to interrogate her.
That's all there is to it. Now...

337
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:30,546
Good night, Sheriff.

338
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,772
Hey, wake up.

339
00:35:49,482 --> 00:35:50,733
What is she doing?

340
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,694
I have no idea.

341
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:12,255
I see them.

342
00:36:13,172 --> 00:36:14,549
Is she there?

343
00:36:15,216 --> 00:36:16,926
That Gretel bitch?

344
00:36:17,844 --> 00:36:21,180
Oh, yes, under the moon,

345
00:36:21,514 --> 00:36:23,099
over the sheriff,

346
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:25,226
in the town.

347
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,031
There she is.

348
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:41,951
Good morning, sunshine.

349
00:36:42,076 --> 00:36:44,871
You tell us what we want
and this might not end up

350
00:36:44,954 --> 00:36:46,706
being the most painful night of your life.

351
00:36:46,789 --> 00:36:48,269
Why don't you two go fuck yourselves?

352
00:36:49,584 --> 00:36:52,086
No, no, better, fuck each other.

353
00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:57,216
These witches, they never learn.

354
00:37:04,932 --> 00:37:06,309
Let's try this again.

355
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:10,479
Where are the children? Why so many?

356
00:37:11,397 --> 00:37:12,398
Where are the children?

357
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:14,609
The blood of the twelve moons

358
00:37:14,692 --> 00:37:16,944
will soon be collected.

359
00:37:18,821 --> 00:37:20,156
And after that,

360
00:37:20,615 --> 00:37:23,951
only one object remains.

361
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,371
Why don't you just burn her?

362
00:37:27,872 --> 00:37:29,790
We're wasting our time. She's useless.

363
00:37:29,874 --> 00:37:32,501
Twelve moons. Twelve...

364
00:37:32,627 --> 00:37:34,045
Twelve, twelve...

365
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:36,464
How many children
have been taken so far?

366
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:38,591
I don't know, ten or eleven.

367
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:40,509
The files. We need to count them.

368
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:49,477
- It's eleven.
- Eleven. Twelve moons.

369
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,312
They need one more child.
One more child.

370
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:52,897
Look, there's
gotta be some sort of pattern.

371
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,273
- Look for their age...
- Yeah.

372
00:37:54,357 --> 00:37:55,733
...hair color, genders, something.

373
00:37:55,816 --> 00:37:58,194
- I've got five girls.
- Six boys.

374
00:37:58,903 --> 00:38:00,029
You need another girl?

375
00:38:00,738 --> 00:38:02,178
"Twelve moons," what does that mean?

376
00:38:02,198 --> 00:38:03,866
It's a month. It's a month.

377
00:38:05,868 --> 00:38:07,828
There's no April. April is missing.
It's April.

378
00:38:07,954 --> 00:38:09,580
They need a girl born in April.

379
00:38:11,707 --> 00:38:13,125
You are too late.

380
00:38:22,593 --> 00:38:23,636
- Go!
- Yes!

381
00:38:26,055 --> 00:38:29,141
Sheriff, birth records of Augsburg.
Do you have them here?

382
00:38:29,225 --> 00:38:33,771
It is there. Strictly for the law
of this town, not for

383
00:38:33,854 --> 00:38:35,648
filthy bounty hunters like yourself.

384
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:36,774
Come on.

385
00:38:37,817 --> 00:38:39,068
There can't be that many.

386
00:38:42,405 --> 00:38:43,406
Ah!

387
00:38:44,532 --> 00:38:45,700
- Anything?
- I only got one!

388
00:38:45,783 --> 00:38:47,618
Little girl, six years old, born April 8th.

389
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:50,464
- She's the only one I could find.
- You go.

390
00:38:51,372 --> 00:38:52,456
This girl, do you know her?

391
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,458
Yes, I know her. Mary Behlmer.

392
00:38:54,542 --> 00:38:57,003
Where does she live?
Sheriff, she's in danger!

393
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:08,014
Fire! Fire!

394
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:12,268
Time is up. Tell me where she lives.

395
00:39:26,032 --> 00:39:27,283
Over here!

396
00:39:34,832 --> 00:39:37,043
- Mama!
- Shh!

397
00:39:42,465 --> 00:39:44,133
Stop! Stop right there!

398
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:49,638
Oh, no! No, no. Oh, no.

399
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:51,599
No, Lucas! Lucas.

400
00:39:53,476 --> 00:39:54,643
No!

401
00:39:59,398 --> 00:40:01,442
Damn you!

402
00:40:02,068 --> 00:40:05,154
Too late, already damned.

403
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,993
Take her back!

404
00:40:20,002 --> 00:40:21,420
To the Well!

405
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,588
Over here!

406
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:25,633
We need more help!

407
00:40:33,516 --> 00:40:36,018
Now whatever happens,
I want you to stay cool.

408
00:40:36,894 --> 00:40:39,772
- Follow my lead. Okay?
- Got it.

409
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:41,565
Are you a good shot?

410
00:40:41,649 --> 00:40:42,983
No.

411
00:40:43,067 --> 00:40:44,527
Not really.

412
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:48,030
That's why I use a shotgun.

413
00:41:01,127 --> 00:41:02,294
Gretel,

414
00:41:02,837 --> 00:41:04,505
the famous witch hunter.

415
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,550
Finally we meet.

416
00:41:07,967 --> 00:41:09,093
Who are you?

417
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,801
I see you got my invitation.

418
00:41:14,515 --> 00:41:17,309
Say your name
or I'll pin you to the fucking wall.

419
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:19,228
I go by many names,

420
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:23,899
none of which
you're worthy of pronouncing.

421
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:30,364
Oh, my God.

422
00:41:49,758 --> 00:41:51,051
Help! Help!

423
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:53,846
Please!

424
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:56,348
Hey!

425
00:42:06,817 --> 00:42:07,943
Fuck you!

426
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:11,363
Help!

427
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:16,869
Feisty bitch.

428
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:17,471
Shit.

429
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:34,321
Don't worry.
I'm not going to kill you.

430
00:43:34,947 --> 00:43:36,198
Not now.

431
00:43:37,032 --> 00:43:38,575
And not like this.

432
00:43:40,911 --> 00:43:42,621
You

433
00:43:42,705 --> 00:43:44,540
have something I need.

434
00:43:45,666 --> 00:43:48,335
The last ingredient.

435
00:44:13,068 --> 00:44:16,905
Ugh! Humans have such ghastly taste.

436
00:44:27,291 --> 00:44:29,335
I think this place...

437
00:44:33,797 --> 00:44:35,632
...could use a bit

438
00:44:40,429 --> 00:44:42,097
of color.

439
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:02,659
Shit!

440
00:45:11,585 --> 00:45:12,961
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

441
00:45:18,967 --> 00:45:22,179
Yes. No, people. Please be calm.

442
00:45:22,471 --> 00:45:24,431
Yeah, one at a time.

443
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:32,981
Look what his witch hunters
have brought to Augsburg.

444
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:38,362
Seven people burnt to death in the fire.

445
00:45:38,987 --> 00:45:43,492
And another young, innocent child taken

446
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:47,162
because of those witch hunters.

447
00:45:48,539 --> 00:45:49,540
No.

448
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:52,876
Because of you.

449
00:45:55,504 --> 00:45:58,090
I say bring them all to justice.

450
00:45:58,173 --> 00:45:59,425
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

451
00:45:59,508 --> 00:46:01,510
No! No!

452
00:46:03,053 --> 00:46:06,223
The witch hunters are not the ones
to blame for this.

453
00:46:08,183 --> 00:46:09,685
This is madness.

454
00:46:10,561 --> 00:46:11,562
People,

455
00:46:12,813 --> 00:46:14,773
hasn't enough blood been shed?

456
00:46:25,993 --> 00:46:27,119
No, no...

457
00:46:27,202 --> 00:46:28,620
Not enough, Mayor.

458
00:46:30,581 --> 00:46:31,748
Not yet.

459
00:47:05,908 --> 00:47:06,950
Ah!

460
00:47:09,161 --> 00:47:10,601
- Good morning.
- What are you doing?

461
00:47:10,662 --> 00:47:14,249
You were covered in filth, so I was just

462
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:16,293
cleaning.

463
00:47:28,263 --> 00:47:29,848
What happened?

464
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:31,600
Um...

465
00:47:32,518 --> 00:47:34,186
Well, the witches took a young girl,

466
00:47:34,269 --> 00:47:36,772
and a lot of people died in the fires.

467
00:47:37,189 --> 00:47:39,399
And now the Sheriff,
he's blaming you and your brother

468
00:47:39,483 --> 00:47:40,859
for what happened last night.

469
00:47:41,527 --> 00:47:43,362
Augsburg's not really
safe for you anymore.

470
00:47:43,445 --> 00:47:44,863
And my brother?

471
00:47:44,947 --> 00:47:46,281
Last time I saw him,
he was fighting one of them

472
00:47:46,365 --> 00:47:48,617
on her broom, flying out of town.

473
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:56,708
Right.

474
00:47:58,627 --> 00:47:59,962
Wow.

475
00:48:00,629 --> 00:48:02,548
Where did you get all this stuff?

476
00:48:02,673 --> 00:48:04,007
Um...

477
00:48:04,132 --> 00:48:05,467
From everywhere.

478
00:48:06,051 --> 00:48:08,845
I actually plan to be a witch hunter,
too, when I get older.

479
00:48:08,929 --> 00:48:09,972
Like you guys.

480
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:12,683
This isn't the life we chose, Ben.

481
00:48:17,646 --> 00:48:19,815
I was wondering about that story

482
00:48:20,816 --> 00:48:22,985
about your parents leaving you.

483
00:48:23,485 --> 00:48:24,987
Is all that true?

484
00:48:25,654 --> 00:48:26,697
Yep.

485
00:48:29,616 --> 00:48:30,784
Why?

486
00:48:32,786 --> 00:48:34,121
I don't know.

487
00:48:34,788 --> 00:48:36,456
That's what they did.

488
00:48:41,628 --> 00:48:44,631
Um, I'm sorry.
Do you want some porridge?

489
00:48:45,632 --> 00:48:46,967
Ah! Sure.

490
00:48:57,144 --> 00:49:01,315
Not too hot, not too cold, but just right.

491
00:49:09,865 --> 00:49:11,199
So last night,

492
00:49:11,325 --> 00:49:13,910
who was she,
the witch who attacked us?

493
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,121
I don't know.

494
00:49:16,204 --> 00:49:20,208
She looked normal
at first, but then she changed her face.

495
00:49:21,126 --> 00:49:23,726
- I thought only Grand...
- Grand Witches have that ability, yeah.

496
00:49:31,053 --> 00:49:33,138
Who is this?

497
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:41,188
She lived outside of town
a long time ago.

498
00:49:43,273 --> 00:49:46,026
<i>She was accused of witchcraft,
but she never confessed.</i>

499
00:49:47,027 --> 00:49:48,820
We just burned her anyway.

500
00:49:49,488 --> 00:49:50,572
You're safe.

501
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,658
You'll be safe.

502
00:49:57,162 --> 00:49:58,747
I have to find my brother.

503
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:02,751
Hansel!

504
00:50:03,752 --> 00:50:04,836
Hey!

505
00:50:04,961 --> 00:50:06,588
Hansel! Are you all right?

506
00:50:09,966 --> 00:50:11,635
Oh, shit.

507
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:15,764
The witch hunting is going well, I see.

508
00:50:16,264 --> 00:50:17,432
Yeah.

509
00:50:20,102 --> 00:50:21,603
Hey, say, can you...

510
00:50:22,646 --> 00:50:25,357
Can you tell me
which way is back to town?

511
00:50:26,274 --> 00:50:27,275
That way.

512
00:50:29,194 --> 00:50:30,362
That way.

513
00:50:31,697 --> 00:50:32,823
Okay.

514
00:50:33,198 --> 00:50:34,366
Thank you!

515
00:50:35,534 --> 00:50:37,411
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

516
00:50:39,037 --> 00:50:41,790
- You need some help?
- No, I'm fine.

517
00:50:42,124 --> 00:50:43,792
I'm fine. Thank you.

518
00:50:44,918 --> 00:50:47,170
Okay. I'll see you later.

519
00:50:47,546 --> 00:50:49,047
Motherfucker!

520
00:50:54,136 --> 00:50:55,470
Are you okay?

521
00:50:55,637 --> 00:50:57,139
Hi. Help me.

522
00:51:05,981 --> 00:51:07,691
Hansel!

523
00:51:12,988 --> 00:51:14,656
Hansel!

524
00:51:17,075 --> 00:51:18,368
Hansel!

525
00:52:05,457 --> 00:52:06,458
Come here.

526
00:52:12,881 --> 00:52:15,008
Oh, she's a wild one, eh?

527
00:52:16,218 --> 00:52:17,552
What do you think you're doing?

528
00:52:17,928 --> 00:52:21,515
You're under arrest
for the burning of Augsburg

529
00:52:21,807 --> 00:52:24,684
and for bringing
the witch plague to our streets.

530
00:52:24,768 --> 00:52:27,979
Listen, you idiot! The witches are
planning something big!

531
00:52:28,063 --> 00:52:30,315
I need to find my brother
and save your shitty little...

532
00:52:30,398 --> 00:52:31,650
Shut up.

533
00:52:32,984 --> 00:52:34,236
This time,

534
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:38,907
I do the talking. You do the bleeding.

535
00:52:46,248 --> 00:52:47,374
Are you done yet?

536
00:52:47,749 --> 00:52:49,543
I've got to get to my sister.

537
00:52:50,377 --> 00:52:52,087
This may take a while.

538
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:57,592
But if we don't clean it,
you'll get the fever.

539
00:52:57,926 --> 00:52:59,845
Fever?

540
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:04,266
You've really taken a beating,
haven't you?

541
00:53:05,767 --> 00:53:08,854
I think the real damage
was to my dignity,

542
00:53:09,688 --> 00:53:12,023
which I left somewhere
in that tree back there.

543
00:53:21,283 --> 00:53:23,410
It's probably gonna be easier
if you just get in.

544
00:53:25,203 --> 00:53:26,830
Oh, no, no. No, I can't.

545
00:53:27,122 --> 00:53:28,498
The water is healing.

546
00:53:29,374 --> 00:53:31,793
Yeah, I don't swim well.

547
00:53:32,377 --> 00:53:34,296
Then I'll go in with you.

548
00:53:37,549 --> 00:53:39,217
Oh, okay.

549
00:53:48,059 --> 00:53:49,477
Oh, boy.

550
00:53:59,279 --> 00:54:01,656
So, it's healing waters, did you say?

551
00:54:03,325 --> 00:54:05,327
I have a passion.

552
00:54:06,494 --> 00:54:08,663
Horses, just love them.

553
00:54:09,289 --> 00:54:10,790
Beautiful creatures, huh?

554
00:54:12,709 --> 00:54:16,755
When you break any kind of a horse,

555
00:54:16,838 --> 00:54:19,466
you have to be hard on them
from the beginning.

556
00:54:19,549 --> 00:54:21,676
Show them who's boss.

557
00:54:22,385 --> 00:54:25,388
Or else, they will never learn.

558
00:54:27,515 --> 00:54:29,851
At first, they will hate you.

559
00:54:31,061 --> 00:54:33,313
But once their spirit is broken,

560
00:54:35,649 --> 00:54:38,026
they will do anything you want.

561
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,367
Oh!

562
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:46,493
Bitch!

563
00:55:00,924 --> 00:55:04,052
Hey, boss, maybe we should
take her back to town now.

564
00:55:05,387 --> 00:55:08,181
I'm not finished breaking her yet!

565
00:55:11,643 --> 00:55:13,895
You're making this too easy.

566
00:55:21,695 --> 00:55:22,696
I got it.

567
00:55:27,242 --> 00:55:31,079
You know, the last time
I was in waters like this,

568
00:55:31,788 --> 00:55:34,833
I came across
a formidable Serpent Witch.

569
00:55:35,625 --> 00:55:37,544
She mostly looked like a toad

570
00:55:37,627 --> 00:55:38,948
but she could breathe underwater,

571
00:55:39,087 --> 00:55:41,589
which made her difficult to track.

572
00:55:44,092 --> 00:55:45,552
- She was deadly.
- Shh.

573
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,555
You talk too much.

574
00:56:02,277 --> 00:56:04,446
You're pathetic.

575
00:56:06,448 --> 00:56:07,907
She has guts.

576
00:56:08,616 --> 00:56:11,036
Ooh! I like that.

577
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:12,245
Aah!

578
00:56:12,454 --> 00:56:15,373
That's going to make me enjoy this
even more.

579
00:56:15,957 --> 00:56:16,958
No!

580
00:56:17,042 --> 00:56:18,877
Well, boys, you can have her,

581
00:56:20,378 --> 00:56:21,379
after I'm done...

582
00:56:21,463 --> 00:56:23,548
No! No!

583
00:56:23,631 --> 00:56:25,175
...If there's anything left.

584
00:56:34,684 --> 00:56:35,685
What

585
00:56:36,978 --> 00:56:37,979
the hell?

586
00:56:46,362 --> 00:56:47,363
No!

587
00:57:46,464 --> 00:57:47,841
Following this road,
you should be able to

588
00:57:47,924 --> 00:57:50,301
make it back to Augsburg by nightfall.

589
00:57:50,718 --> 00:57:51,886
Yeah.

590
00:57:52,971 --> 00:57:54,305
I hope so.

591
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:57,142
When you find your sister,

592
00:57:57,225 --> 00:57:59,227
could you come back to see me again?

593
00:58:01,437 --> 00:58:03,273
Yes, of course.

594
00:58:38,433 --> 00:58:39,434
Drink.

595
00:58:40,268 --> 00:58:41,269
No.

596
00:58:43,771 --> 00:58:45,899
Drink!

597
00:59:22,477 --> 00:59:24,479
Why did you save me?

598
00:59:27,273 --> 00:59:28,358
Trolls

599
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:31,402
serve witches.

600
00:59:38,326 --> 00:59:39,661
Hey, wait.

601
00:59:41,037 --> 00:59:42,747
Wait!

602
00:59:48,294 --> 00:59:49,629
What's your name?

603
00:59:51,965 --> 00:59:53,967
Edward.

604
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:58,763
Edward, wait!

605
00:59:59,722 --> 01:00:01,015
Where am I?

606
01:01:17,592 --> 01:01:18,926
Hansel?

607
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:20,136
Gretel?

608
01:01:20,219 --> 01:01:21,220
Where have you been?

609
01:01:21,304 --> 01:01:23,097
- Where have you been?

610
01:01:30,688 --> 01:01:31,856
- Hi.
- Hi.

611
01:01:31,939 --> 01:01:33,274
Hey, what happened to your face?

612
01:01:34,859 --> 01:01:36,361
Gretel?

613
01:01:36,444 --> 01:01:37,528
- Who did this to you?
- I'm okay.

614
01:01:37,612 --> 01:01:38,613
Who did this to you?

615
01:01:38,738 --> 01:01:39,739
I'm okay.

616
01:01:41,783 --> 01:01:43,451
Honey, I'm sorry.

617
01:01:44,619 --> 01:01:46,120
I'm sorry.

618
01:01:51,959 --> 01:01:53,294
- You okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

619
01:01:53,795 --> 01:01:55,129
I'm okay.

620
01:02:00,885 --> 01:02:01,803
Where are we?

621
01:02:03,304 --> 01:02:04,555
I don't know.

622
01:02:04,639 --> 01:02:05,681
Oh!

623
01:02:07,558 --> 01:02:08,601
You okay?

624
01:02:08,684 --> 01:02:10,436
Did you have to land on me?

625
01:02:14,315 --> 01:02:15,983
What is this place?

626
01:02:29,831 --> 01:02:31,958
This isn't a regular witch's lair.

627
01:02:32,041 --> 01:02:33,167
No.

628
01:02:34,919 --> 01:02:37,255
Let's get the hell out of here.

629
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:49,934
Hey, sis?

630
01:02:52,270 --> 01:02:53,950
I think you're gonna
want to come see this.

631
01:03:04,949 --> 01:03:07,452
I think this is our old house.

632
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,955
And this is our old room.

633
01:03:13,291 --> 01:03:14,750
Here. Look.

634
01:03:15,543 --> 01:03:16,878
There's your bed.

635
01:03:17,795 --> 01:03:18,880
Right?

636
01:03:19,922 --> 01:03:21,007
Ah!

637
01:03:23,217 --> 01:03:24,510
Remember this?

638
01:03:30,475 --> 01:03:31,976
I think that's you.

639
01:03:32,643 --> 01:03:35,313
And some sort of vicious badger.

640
01:03:41,152 --> 01:03:42,820
Old beds.

641
01:03:51,996 --> 01:03:53,331
Hansel.

642
01:03:56,167 --> 01:03:59,170
You ever wonder
what happened to our parents?

643
01:04:06,302 --> 01:04:08,471
We don't talk about that, Gretel.

644
01:04:08,596 --> 01:04:10,306
We made a promise, you know that.

645
01:04:10,515 --> 01:04:12,850
Why do you think
the witches' spells don't work on us?

646
01:04:12,934 --> 01:04:13,893
Leave it alone.

647
01:04:13,976 --> 01:04:15,561
- This is our house.
- Yeah?

648
01:04:15,645 --> 01:04:17,146
This is where we grew up!

649
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:19,273
And what does that look like to you?

650
01:04:19,482 --> 01:04:22,068
I don't know, Gretel.
We grew up over a witch's lair.

651
01:04:22,151 --> 01:04:23,194
So what? So we're cursed?

652
01:04:23,277 --> 01:04:25,238
No. I think that our mother was...

653
01:04:27,698 --> 01:04:32,620
I see you finally found your way
home after all these years.

654
01:04:33,287 --> 01:04:35,122
Mmm. How very sweet.

655
01:04:46,175 --> 01:04:48,177
I remember this house.

656
01:04:48,678 --> 01:04:50,680
The house of Adrianna,

657
01:04:51,514 --> 01:04:53,766
the Great White Witch.

658
01:04:55,851 --> 01:04:58,563
Your whore of a mother.

659
01:05:02,817 --> 01:05:05,278
Let me tell you a little story.

660
01:05:11,033 --> 01:05:15,204
Once upon a time,
near a shitty little town,

661
01:05:16,205 --> 01:05:21,002
there was a farmer who fell
in love with a white witch.

662
01:05:21,711 --> 01:05:24,380
<i>And with their two beautiful children,</i>

663
01:05:24,714 --> 01:05:27,216
<i>oh, they were so happy.</i>

664
01:05:28,718 --> 01:05:31,220
<i>But not for long.</i>

665
01:05:33,556 --> 01:05:37,059
<i>During a Blood Moon, there is a potion</i>

666
01:05:37,393 --> 01:05:40,229
<i>that will make you immune to fire.</i>

667
01:05:41,188 --> 01:05:43,566
<i>The key to the potion</i>

668
01:05:43,649 --> 01:05:47,987
<i>is the heart of a Grand White Witch.</i>

669
01:05:49,071 --> 01:05:52,992
<i>But your mother,
the most powerful white witch,</i>

670
01:05:53,075 --> 01:05:55,077
<i>was too strong for us.</i>

671
01:05:55,745 --> 01:05:58,080
<i>So it had to be you, Gretel.</i>

672
01:05:58,414 --> 01:06:01,709
<i>It had to be your heart.</i>

673
01:06:02,627 --> 01:06:06,714
<i>As the Blood Moon approached,
I sent out a little rumor</i>

674
01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:09,634
<i>to the people of Augsburg.</i>

675
01:06:10,343 --> 01:06:12,511
<i>And when she knew they were coming,</i>

676
01:06:12,928 --> 01:06:15,681
<i>she had your father take you
into the forest to hide you.</i>

677
01:06:15,765 --> 01:06:17,767
Father! Wait!

678
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:19,268
Don't let her get away!

679
01:06:19,352 --> 01:06:21,020
<i>She didn't know what
they would do to her,</i>

680
01:06:21,103 --> 01:06:23,439
<i>but she was too proud to run.</i>

681
01:06:23,773 --> 01:06:27,735
<i>And a white witch would never use her
magic against humans.</i>

682
01:06:29,403 --> 01:06:31,447
<i>When your father came back for her...</i>

683
01:06:32,657 --> 01:06:33,658
No!

684
01:06:33,741 --> 01:06:35,534
<i>...they hanged him.</i>

685
01:06:35,618 --> 01:06:37,787
- Run him up!
- No!

686
01:06:39,622 --> 01:06:41,957
<i>...right in front</i>

687
01:06:42,583 --> 01:06:46,253
<i>of your mother's burning flesh!</i>

688
01:06:53,844 --> 01:06:55,346
<i>Adrianna was gone.</i>

689
01:06:57,348 --> 01:06:59,600
<i>But so was your heart.</i>

690
01:07:01,268 --> 01:07:03,938
<i>And the Blood Moon passed.</i>

691
01:07:04,855 --> 01:07:06,190
The end.

692
01:07:06,941 --> 01:07:09,819
It's a beautiful story, don't you think?

693
01:07:10,945 --> 01:07:13,614
They died to save you.

694
01:07:15,991 --> 01:07:17,201
And all your life,

695
01:07:17,326 --> 01:07:19,453
how you've hated them.

696
01:07:19,787 --> 01:07:21,539
Tomorrow

697
01:07:21,622 --> 01:07:25,042
sisters from all dark corners of the land

698
01:07:25,251 --> 01:07:28,003
will join me in the light
of the Blood Moon

699
01:07:28,295 --> 01:07:30,798
for the greatest Sabbath of all.

700
01:07:31,799 --> 01:07:33,634
The only thing left

701
01:07:34,593 --> 01:07:36,929
is the everlasting power

702
01:07:37,304 --> 01:07:38,973
of the heart

703
01:07:39,390 --> 01:07:41,642
of a Grand White Witch.

704
01:07:41,726 --> 01:07:42,893
You know, you talk too much.

705
01:07:53,654 --> 01:07:56,073
Bad move, witch hunter.

706
01:08:01,829 --> 01:08:03,497
Hansel!

707
01:08:13,007 --> 01:08:15,509
Drink it. It will help the pain.

708
01:08:18,679 --> 01:08:19,847
Mina?

709
01:08:26,353 --> 01:08:27,938
What did you do?

710
01:08:28,022 --> 01:08:29,523
Mina?

711
01:08:36,572 --> 01:08:37,907
You're a witch?

712
01:08:38,115 --> 01:08:40,367
There are good witches in the world.

713
01:08:40,534 --> 01:08:42,620
- Not many, but some.
- You stay back.

714
01:08:42,787 --> 01:08:44,205
I'm a witch, but I won't hurt you.

715
01:08:44,371 --> 01:08:46,582
I checked you. You were...
You were clean.

716
01:08:46,665 --> 01:08:48,834
Yeah, but only the dark witches
bear the signs.

717
01:08:48,918 --> 01:08:51,420
Dark witches?
What are you talking about?

718
01:08:51,545 --> 01:08:52,546
Think about it,

719
01:08:52,671 --> 01:08:55,674
if their spells don't work on you,
why would mine?

720
01:08:56,592 --> 01:08:58,260
I'm not like them, Hansel.

721
01:09:02,556 --> 01:09:04,892
Gretel. Shit.

722
01:09:06,393 --> 01:09:09,063
- Where are you going?
- They have my sister.

723
01:09:09,146 --> 01:09:10,815
Who has your sister?

724
01:09:10,898 --> 01:09:12,900
Witches have my sister. They...

725
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:14,819
- Where?
- They said something

726
01:09:15,277 --> 01:09:18,405
about a ritual or a gathering.
I don't know.

727
01:09:18,572 --> 01:09:21,784
There's a place deep in the forest,
nearby the mountains.

728
01:09:22,076 --> 01:09:25,246
A place dark witches use
for their Sabbath.

729
01:09:25,371 --> 01:09:26,497
Where is it?

730
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:27,581
Hansel, I...

731
01:09:27,706 --> 01:09:29,124
Mina, how do I get there?

732
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:30,960
If there is a Sabbath,
there will be many witches.

733
01:09:31,043 --> 01:09:33,879
They'll be too powerful.
They'll kill you, Hansel.

734
01:09:34,588 --> 01:09:36,090
I don't have time for this.

735
01:09:36,173 --> 01:09:39,677
No, listen, Hansel,
I found something here, in this cave.

736
01:09:40,261 --> 01:09:44,098
Something very powerful.
Something that could help us.

737
01:09:44,765 --> 01:09:47,518
The <i>Abramelin Grimoire!</i> It exists!

738
01:09:47,601 --> 01:09:49,601
This is the book
of protection against black magic.

739
01:09:51,021 --> 01:09:53,524
I can't believe this.
Where did you find it?

740
01:09:53,607 --> 01:09:55,276
Don't ask, kid.

741
01:09:55,401 --> 01:09:56,694
If this thing does what it says,

742
01:09:56,777 --> 01:09:58,529
it will allow us
to penetrate their protection.

743
01:09:58,612 --> 01:09:59,655
Oh, yeah?

744
01:09:59,822 --> 01:10:02,491
Their wands won't
protect them anymore.

745
01:10:02,658 --> 01:10:03,659
We just need something to bless.

746
01:10:03,826 --> 01:10:06,161
Okay, let's start with this.

747
01:10:30,769 --> 01:10:32,980
I hope this works.

748
01:10:36,692 --> 01:10:37,985
All right.

749
01:10:42,281 --> 01:10:43,532
You ever shoot a gun?

750
01:10:44,783 --> 01:10:47,286
Well, I did win the county fair

751
01:10:48,287 --> 01:10:49,747
three times.

752
01:10:51,457 --> 01:10:53,792
All right. In that case...

753
01:10:58,130 --> 01:11:00,007
Don't touch the gun.

754
01:11:16,815 --> 01:11:17,816
Edward.

755
01:11:19,318 --> 01:11:20,986
What are you doing here?

756
01:11:23,197 --> 01:11:24,698
What's going on?

757
01:11:28,661 --> 01:11:30,329
Muriel.

758
01:11:37,002 --> 01:11:38,379
Edward,

759
01:11:39,546 --> 01:11:40,714
I need your help.

760
01:11:45,678 --> 01:11:47,346
Please, Edward.

761
01:11:50,557 --> 01:11:54,478
Hey! You filthy oaf!

762
01:11:54,561 --> 01:11:57,064
Get the children. We're moving out.

763
01:12:02,027 --> 01:12:04,697
It's time.

764
01:12:15,082 --> 01:12:16,083
Okay, are we good?

765
01:12:16,959 --> 01:12:18,127
Yes.

766
01:12:29,263 --> 01:12:32,850
Well, as far as you go, kid.

767
01:12:33,767 --> 01:12:36,603
But, I will leave you with this.

768
01:12:38,772 --> 01:12:40,441
- Wow!
- Find a place to hide.

769
01:12:40,566 --> 01:12:41,692
Shoot anything that moves.

770
01:12:43,277 --> 01:12:44,611
Good luck.

771
01:13:05,966 --> 01:13:07,301
Shut up!

772
01:13:13,307 --> 01:13:14,308
Oh!

773
01:13:30,324 --> 01:13:31,700
After tonight,

774
01:13:32,493 --> 01:13:35,829
no sister will be burned on their pyres!

775
01:13:37,915 --> 01:13:41,126
No sister will be ashes on the ground!

776
01:13:41,335 --> 01:13:43,337
I want your brains!

777
01:13:44,213 --> 01:13:45,214
And now,

778
01:13:46,507 --> 01:13:49,218
now we feast!

779
01:13:49,384 --> 01:13:51,678
- That's a lot of witches.

780
01:13:52,638 --> 01:13:53,639
Okay.

781
01:13:54,181 --> 01:13:56,225
I'm gonna go down
around the other side.

782
01:13:56,725 --> 01:13:59,394
Push them into the middle,
get them away from the kids.

783
01:13:59,853 --> 01:14:02,564
Now, when you see my signal,
you unleash hell.

784
01:14:02,648 --> 01:14:03,774
Wish me luck.

785
01:14:03,857 --> 01:14:05,442
Wait. Wait. What's the signal?

786
01:14:05,526 --> 01:14:09,696
It'll be me blowing one of these
bitches' heads off.

787
01:14:15,702 --> 01:14:17,121
Yes.

788
01:14:18,455 --> 01:14:21,333
The hour has come!

789
01:14:22,543 --> 01:14:25,546
The Blood Moon arrives!

790
01:14:25,712 --> 01:14:31,343
The Grand White Witch dies!

791
01:14:37,683 --> 01:14:42,104
Excuse me! Excuse me, ladies. Hi.

792
01:14:43,647 --> 01:14:47,151
It seems as if I've lost my invitation
to your little dinner party here.

793
01:14:47,276 --> 01:14:48,569
I apologize.

794
01:14:48,694 --> 01:14:51,697
But don't worry.
I didn't come empty-handed.

795
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:54,825
Sisters!

796
01:14:56,160 --> 01:15:01,123
Allow me to introduce you
to the famous witch hunter Hansel.

797
01:15:02,207 --> 01:15:07,296
Personally responsible for the deaths
of over 600.

798
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:12,092
Listen to me carefully!

799
01:15:12,634 --> 01:15:16,138
If you let my sister
and the children go now,

800
01:15:16,638 --> 01:15:20,142
I'll consider not killing
each and every one of you.

801
01:15:26,648 --> 01:15:27,649
Enough with this.

802
01:15:30,694 --> 01:15:32,404
- Take his fucking head off.
- Yes.

803
01:15:42,289 --> 01:15:43,707
Please work.

804
01:16:34,633 --> 01:16:38,512
We have to hurry. You get the children.
I'll get her heart!

805
01:16:38,595 --> 01:16:39,930
Now, move!

806
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:58,282
Fucking...

807
01:17:09,876 --> 01:17:10,877
Eat it!

808
01:17:20,887 --> 01:17:22,306
Walk!

809
01:17:22,389 --> 01:17:23,557
Move it!

810
01:17:29,396 --> 01:17:30,397
Come on!

811
01:17:30,897 --> 01:17:31,982
Gretel!

812
01:17:32,065 --> 01:17:33,191
Ohh!

813
01:17:37,529 --> 01:17:38,739
Edward.

814
01:17:39,156 --> 01:17:40,157
Gretel!

815
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:43,493
I'm okay! Go get the children!

816
01:17:45,037 --> 01:17:46,121
Stay still!

817
01:17:49,166 --> 01:17:51,335
Get off of me!

818
01:18:11,188 --> 01:18:12,356
No!

819
01:18:25,243 --> 01:18:26,578
Thank you!

820
01:18:55,273 --> 01:18:56,608
- Shit!
- Too late.

821
01:19:05,909 --> 01:19:07,077
Gretel!

822
01:19:36,356 --> 01:19:37,691
Thank you.

823
01:19:42,028 --> 01:19:43,530
You okay?

824
01:19:43,613 --> 01:19:45,031
Muriel's still alive.

825
01:19:45,157 --> 01:19:46,741
I'm not done.

826
01:19:46,825 --> 01:19:48,493
Ah, Gretel, Mina. Mina, Gretel.

827
01:19:48,577 --> 01:19:50,579
- Hey.
- I need that.

828
01:19:50,662 --> 01:19:52,263
- Okay.
- She flew off that way.

829
01:19:55,542 --> 01:19:57,169
Well, where are you going?

830
01:19:57,252 --> 01:19:58,462
I have to help Edward!

831
01:19:58,628 --> 01:20:01,882
Edward. Who the fuck's Edward?

832
01:20:57,938 --> 01:21:00,106
- Ah! Hell, yeah!
- Ben!

833
01:21:01,650 --> 01:21:03,276
Hansel! Hansel!

834
01:21:03,485 --> 01:21:05,570
I did it! I shot her! Muriel.

835
01:21:05,654 --> 01:21:08,657
- Where?
- Uh, I shot her down, over there.

836
01:21:08,782 --> 01:21:09,950
Good job.

837
01:21:17,290 --> 01:21:18,792
She's close.

838
01:21:30,136 --> 01:21:31,555
Edward?

839
01:22:15,098 --> 01:22:17,392
Oh, you can't be serious.

840
01:22:30,947 --> 01:22:32,449
Is this...

841
01:22:32,866 --> 01:22:34,451
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

842
01:22:35,368 --> 01:22:36,369
Wow.

843
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:40,624
Whatever you do,
don't eat the fucking candy.

844
01:22:52,552 --> 01:22:54,721
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
Stop right there,

845
01:22:54,888 --> 01:22:56,890
or the little boy dies.

846
01:22:58,141 --> 01:23:01,144
I thought it would
be fitting for us to end up here,

847
01:23:01,478 --> 01:23:03,063
where it all began.

848
01:23:03,647 --> 01:23:06,107
Kind of lost its charm a little, huh?

849
01:23:06,733 --> 01:23:07,901
Drop it.

850
01:23:13,573 --> 01:23:14,574
Good boy.

851
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:17,160
Don't worry, kid.

852
01:23:18,995 --> 01:23:20,235
I'm not gonna let her hurt you.

853
01:23:20,246 --> 01:23:21,247
Oh, really?

854
01:23:22,165 --> 01:23:23,416
Really.

855
01:23:33,677 --> 01:23:35,345
The end is near,

856
01:23:36,262 --> 01:23:37,472
witch hunter.

857
01:23:39,516 --> 01:23:44,396
I wish I could say
it would be painless, but that

858
01:23:45,230 --> 01:23:47,190
would be a lie.

859
01:23:54,489 --> 01:23:55,573
Get away from him.

860
01:23:57,075 --> 01:23:59,327
Always funny seeing
a white witch with a wand.

861
01:24:01,287 --> 01:24:04,207
What are you going to do?
Hit me with your love spell?

862
01:24:08,086 --> 01:24:09,587
Not bad.

863
01:24:15,593 --> 01:24:19,097
Sacrificing yourself to save a human.

864
01:24:19,764 --> 01:24:21,015
Pathetic.

865
01:24:26,604 --> 01:24:28,356
No!

866
01:24:34,696 --> 01:24:36,281
Mina. Hey.

867
01:24:36,823 --> 01:24:38,032
Come here.

868
01:24:41,953 --> 01:24:43,288
Hansel.

869
01:24:47,083 --> 01:24:48,084
Hansel.

870
01:24:48,835 --> 01:24:50,336
I tried to stop her.

871
01:24:50,587 --> 01:24:52,797
You did. You did good.

872
01:24:54,257 --> 01:24:55,759
You did good.

873
01:25:01,264 --> 01:25:04,017
I want you to do something for me.

874
01:25:05,643 --> 01:25:06,978
Anything.

875
01:25:11,566 --> 01:25:14,027
Kill the fucking bitch.

876
01:25:41,638 --> 01:25:43,890
You got to be fucking kidding me.

877
01:26:49,205 --> 01:26:50,915
Oh, please.

878
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:52,333
Please?

879
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:54,043
Please, stop.

880
01:26:55,587 --> 01:26:56,921
Please.

881
01:26:57,046 --> 01:26:58,089
Yeah, nice try.

882
01:28:03,363 --> 01:28:05,156
I fucking hate you.

883
01:28:05,823 --> 01:28:09,410
You know, you look like shit.

884
01:28:09,494 --> 01:28:10,495
You know that?

885
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:13,581
- So do you.

886
01:28:37,605 --> 01:28:38,773
Finish her already.

887
01:29:06,259 --> 01:29:08,886
<i>Revenge doesn't
change the past.</i>

888
01:29:13,057 --> 01:29:15,101
<i>It won't bring our parents back.</i>

889
01:29:15,435 --> 01:29:17,395
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah.

890
01:29:17,812 --> 01:29:19,480
- Glad to hear it.
- Ow!

891
01:29:20,148 --> 01:29:21,709
<i>But it sure as hell feels good.</i>

892
01:29:25,319 --> 01:29:27,739
<i>My sister and I know the truth.</i>

893
01:29:29,574 --> 01:29:31,576
<i>We know who we are now.</i>

894
01:29:33,453 --> 01:29:34,871
<i>And so do they.</i>

895
01:29:37,373 --> 01:29:39,208
<i>They know our story,</i>

896
01:29:39,959 --> 01:29:41,461
<i>our powers,</i>

897
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:43,463
<i>what we can do.</i>

898
01:29:45,715 --> 01:29:47,383
<i>And they should fear us.</i>

899
01:29:50,636 --> 01:29:51,679
<i>All of us.</i>

900
01:29:52,055 --> 01:29:53,973
We should be getting close now.

901
01:29:54,098 --> 01:29:56,559
And so after this next one,
we've got three more to go.

902
01:29:56,684 --> 01:30:00,146
Three? You said three more
three witches ago.

903
01:30:00,229 --> 01:30:02,607
Come on, you always say,
more witches, more money, right?

904
01:30:02,732 --> 01:30:04,567
Yeah, but you ain't getting any of it.

905
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:06,027
Unless you want to pull the cart.

906
01:30:08,196 --> 01:30:09,655
Right, big guy?

907
01:30:09,822 --> 01:30:11,022
I told you he'd come in handy.

908
01:30:12,742 --> 01:30:15,078
<i>There are good witches
in the world.</i>

909
01:30:15,745 --> 01:30:17,413
<i>We know that now.</i>

910
01:30:18,247 --> 01:30:21,834
<i>But for the ones practicing
the black arts, beware.</i>

911
01:30:21,918 --> 01:30:23,628
<i>We're coming for you.</i>

912
01:30:24,337 --> 01:30:27,173
<i>No matter where you are, we'll find you.</i>

913
01:30:28,841 --> 01:30:30,593
<i>And dead or alive,</i>

914
01:30:31,677 --> 01:30:33,054
<i>we'll take you down.</i>

915
01:30:33,179 --> 01:30:35,848
Edward, want to knock?

916
01:30:35,849 --> 01:30:37,699
My girl.

917
01:30:37,725 --> 01:30:39,769
<i>Dead.</i>

918
01:31:05,002 --> 01:31:08,381
I hate to break it to you,
but it's not gonna be an open casket.
