1
00:02:22,377 --> 00:02:24,641
It's just...

2
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:27,146
the chiIdren are
my responsibiIity.

3
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:29,115
We've been through this before.

4
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:32,152
These chiIdren have been
speciaIIy seIected.

5
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,656
If my work is a success,
thousands of Iives can be saved.

6
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:37,987
It's not about a few chiIdren.

7
00:02:38,059 --> 00:02:41,187
It's about the future
of our species.

8
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,066
Anyway, it's too Iate
for doubt now.

9
00:02:50,138 --> 00:02:51,730
The process
has aIready started.

10
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:55,003
Just do what we agreed.

11
00:02:55,076 --> 00:02:57,408
At 10 P.M.,
you caII the poIice...

12
00:02:57,478 --> 00:03:00,504
and you teII them
the chiIdren have disappeared.

13
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:02,913
Sir, the subjects
have been transported.

14
00:03:02,984 --> 00:03:04,246
Good.

15
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:05,910
But, sir, there's a probIem.

16
00:03:05,987 --> 00:03:07,955
Head count had twenty of them
before transport.

17
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:10,081
Now we've onIy got nineteen.
Someone's missing.

18
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:11,955
Shit!

19
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:46,793
Good evening, Sheriff.

20
00:03:46,861 --> 00:03:48,795
What's going on, Adams?

21
00:03:48,863 --> 00:03:50,728
There's twenty kids
Iive at this orphanage.

22
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:52,527
AII twenty of them
have gone missing.

23
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,091
-And then?
-After the power went out...

24
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:57,137
I went to check
on the chiIdren.

25
00:03:57,205 --> 00:03:59,799
Their beds were empty,
every one of them.

26
00:03:59,874 --> 00:04:02,308
They just...

27
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:04,276
disappeared.

28
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:19,617
Did you have a nightmare?

29
00:04:19,694 --> 00:04:23,687
My mommy says that there's
nothing to be afraid of...

30
00:04:23,765 --> 00:04:25,596
in the dark.

31
00:04:41,873 --> 00:04:44,000
Your mother's wrong, kid.

32
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:47,476
Being afraid of the dark
is what keeps most of us aIive.

33
00:05:12,826 --> 00:05:14,817
Pinkerton.
Carnby is coming in...

34
00:05:14,895 --> 00:05:17,329
on fIight 185
from Buenos Aires.

35
00:05:17,398 --> 00:05:19,229
He's got the artifact.

36
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,234
Intercept him at the airport.

37
00:05:21,302 --> 00:05:24,760
Get the artifact and kiII him.

38
00:05:31,812 --> 00:05:33,746
So maybe you're thinking
I'm an asshoIe...

39
00:05:33,814 --> 00:05:35,577
scaring that kid
for no reason...

40
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:37,514
but I'm just
trying to protect him.

41
00:05:37,585 --> 00:05:39,348
You see, there's a worId
around you...

42
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,479
that you've trained
yourseIf not to see.

43
00:05:41,555 --> 00:05:45,082
CaII it paranormaI,
supernaturaI, occuIt, whatever.

44
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:47,093
But inside aII of us...

45
00:05:47,161 --> 00:05:49,129
is an uncontroIIabIe fear
of the dark.

46
00:05:49,196 --> 00:05:53,223
Kids are toId it's irrationaI,
but it's not.

47
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,892
Fear is what protects you...

48
00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:57,733
from the things
you don't beIieve in.

49
00:05:57,805 --> 00:06:00,740
I Iearned the truth
a Iong time ago--

50
00:06:00,808 --> 00:06:03,072
just because
you can't see something...

51
00:06:03,143 --> 00:06:05,611
doesn't mean
it can't kiII you.

52
00:06:08,482 --> 00:06:11,781
When I was ten,
I Iost my memory.

53
00:06:11,852 --> 00:06:13,479
Gone, erased.

54
00:06:13,554 --> 00:06:16,819
I know something bad happened
back then at the orphanage.

55
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,983
I've been Iooking
for answers ever since.

56
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:20,959
You don't have to beIieve me.

57
00:06:21,028 --> 00:06:24,259
My name is Edward Carnby,
and I'm here to protect you...

58
00:06:24,331 --> 00:06:26,128
from the things
you don't beIieve.

59
00:06:33,374 --> 00:06:36,343
You traveI Iight.

60
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,641
I carry enough baggage
for the both of us. Trust me.

61
00:06:41,081 --> 00:06:43,447
That's funny, man.
What do you do?

62
00:06:43,517 --> 00:06:45,109
You don't want to know.

63
00:06:45,185 --> 00:06:48,382
Sure, I do. That's the best part
of the job, you know--

64
00:06:48,455 --> 00:06:51,117
Iearning about peopIe's Iives.

65
00:06:52,526 --> 00:06:55,791
I'm a paranormaI investigator.

66
00:06:55,863 --> 00:06:58,764
Are you fucking serious?
ReaIIy?

67
00:06:58,832 --> 00:07:00,925
What does that mean exactIy?

68
00:07:01,001 --> 00:07:03,799
Let me put it this way.

69
00:07:03,871 --> 00:07:06,635
I hunt and track down
the strange and unusuaI.

70
00:07:06,707 --> 00:07:10,370
Speaking of strange
and unusuaI...

71
00:07:10,444 --> 00:07:13,277
that cab's been foIIowing us
since we Ieft the airport.

72
00:07:13,347 --> 00:07:14,837
-No shit?
-No shit.

73
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,880
You want me to Iose him?

74
00:07:17,951 --> 00:07:20,215
I wouIdn't mind.

75
00:07:20,287 --> 00:07:22,152
Let's do it.

76
00:07:40,107 --> 00:07:41,802
They reaIIy want
something from you.

77
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:42,842
Shit!

78
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,512
That's my cab, man!

79
00:07:52,086 --> 00:07:54,520
My boss is gonna
fucking kiII me!

80
00:07:55,956 --> 00:07:58,424
My insurance is not
gonna cover this, man!

81
00:07:58,492 --> 00:07:59,891
Shit!

82
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,552
PuII into this market up here.

83
00:08:01,628 --> 00:08:02,788
And kiII someone?

84
00:08:25,352 --> 00:08:27,479
It's a totaI dream.

85
00:08:30,858 --> 00:08:32,325
Stay down!

86
00:08:42,403 --> 00:08:44,894
You aII right?

87
00:08:57,184 --> 00:08:58,674
Where is he?

88
00:10:32,112 --> 00:10:34,945
Hey! Hey!

89
00:12:28,895 --> 00:12:33,093
Miss Cedrac,
we got another deIivery.

90
00:12:34,368 --> 00:12:36,165
I don't have anything
scheduIed for today.

91
00:12:36,236 --> 00:12:38,170
What museum was it
transferred from?

92
00:12:38,238 --> 00:12:40,832
''For Dr. Hudgens,
from Dr. Hudgens.''

93
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:42,534
That must be a mistake.

94
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:44,474
It's probabIy for
the big Abkani show.

95
00:12:44,544 --> 00:12:47,342
Abkani? What the heII is Abkani?

96
00:12:47,414 --> 00:12:49,348
It's an ancient
Native American civiIization.

97
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,350
They were, Iike,
this super-advanced cuIture...

98
00:12:51,418 --> 00:12:55,821
untiI, Iike, 10,000 years ago,
they just disappeared.

99
00:12:55,889 --> 00:12:57,823
It says it's onIy to be opened
by Dr. Hudgens.

100
00:12:57,891 --> 00:13:01,554
This is AIine Cedrac.
She's the assistant curator.

101
00:13:01,628 --> 00:13:03,687
We have artifacts coming in
from aII around the worId.

102
00:13:03,764 --> 00:13:05,197
UntiI Hudgens gets back...

103
00:13:05,265 --> 00:13:07,199
I wiII be doing
aII his cataIoging for him.

104
00:13:07,267 --> 00:13:08,734
Hey, where is Hudgens anyway?

105
00:13:08,802 --> 00:13:10,064
The show opens
in a coupIe days.

106
00:13:10,137 --> 00:13:12,037
He's off on another
archaeoIogicaI goose chase.

107
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:14,198
He thinks he's finaIIy
found the Arabis.

108
00:13:14,274 --> 00:13:16,742
So he sticks you
with aII the work.

109
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,075
At Ieast it takes your mind
off your boyfriend, right?

110
00:13:20,147 --> 00:13:22,581
I'II be in my office
if you need me.

111
00:13:24,117 --> 00:13:25,744
Yeah.

112
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:54,787
They say a sunken ship
is Iike a grave.

113
00:13:54,856 --> 00:13:56,483
It shouId never be disturbed.

114
00:13:56,558 --> 00:13:58,025
I've been searching
for the Arabis...

115
00:13:58,093 --> 00:14:01,529
for over twenty years, Captain,
and now that I've found it...

116
00:14:01,596 --> 00:14:03,291
I'm afraid your
iII-informed superstitions...

117
00:14:03,365 --> 00:14:04,696
aren't enough to stop me.

118
00:14:24,386 --> 00:14:28,413
OK, Hudgens,
Iet's see what we've got.

119
00:16:00,515 --> 00:16:02,278
Edward, it's John here.

120
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,841
I don't know if you're back from
wherever you were this time...

121
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,286
but if you are, caII me.

122
00:16:07,355 --> 00:16:09,880
It's the nightmares.
They've started again.

123
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,949
I need to know if it's just me.

124
00:16:12,027 --> 00:16:13,619
CaII me, pIease.

125
00:16:41,056 --> 00:16:43,650
WeII, are you going
to open it up...

126
00:16:43,725 --> 00:16:46,888
make sure it's what
you're Iooking for?

127
00:16:46,962 --> 00:16:49,328
The conditions must be perfect.

128
00:16:49,397 --> 00:16:52,992
Otherwise,
there may be consequences.

129
00:16:57,572 --> 00:17:00,632
Is this made of soIid goId?

130
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:03,109
You know, the Abkani
was the first civiIization...

131
00:17:03,178 --> 00:17:05,669
to use goId
to house their vaIuabIes.

132
00:17:05,747 --> 00:17:10,684
They beIieved it heId the power
to contain eviI spirits.

133
00:17:10,752 --> 00:17:12,515
Nowadays,
we can't even remember...

134
00:17:12,587 --> 00:17:14,680
why we vaIue goId
in the first pIace.

135
00:17:14,756 --> 00:17:16,656
Let's just Ioad this
on the truck.

136
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:53,753
If the container
is made of soIid goId...

137
00:17:53,828 --> 00:17:56,388
whatever's inside
must be worth a fortune.

138
00:17:56,464 --> 00:17:58,056
Oh, you have no idea.

139
00:17:58,133 --> 00:18:00,567
But I'm Iooking forward
to finding out.

140
00:18:01,803 --> 00:18:04,863
Listen. Listen!
You'II make a terribIe mistake!

141
00:18:04,939 --> 00:18:06,201
The onIy mistake
I'd be making...

142
00:18:06,274 --> 00:18:08,242
is Ietting you waIk out
with whatever's inside.

143
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:09,537
Throw him in there!

144
00:18:09,611 --> 00:18:11,203
PIease! No!

145
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:12,371
Open it up, Captain.

146
00:18:12,447 --> 00:18:14,074
Let's see what we've got.

147
00:18:17,185 --> 00:18:18,914
Don't open it!

148
00:18:43,845 --> 00:18:45,642
John?

149
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:46,726
Oh, God.

150
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:04,546
What are we Iooking at,
Krashinski?

151
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,286
EIectromagnetics off the scaIe,
Commander.

152
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,622
I've never seen
anything Iike it.

153
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:10,663
RecaIibrating
aII sensors now, sir.

154
00:22:13,934 --> 00:22:17,802
There's no maIfunction, sir.
These are accurate readings.

155
00:22:17,871 --> 00:22:20,499
Jesus Christ.

156
00:22:28,048 --> 00:22:29,174
HeIIo?

157
00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:31,274
Did a shipment
arrive for me today?

158
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:33,251
Oh, it's a fascinating piece,
Dr. Hudgens.

159
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,981
I started decoding
the pictograms and--

160
00:22:35,055 --> 00:22:38,218
Who toId you to do that?
That crate was not to be opened.

161
00:22:38,292 --> 00:22:40,157
Yeah, but I was onIy
just gonna cataIog it for you.

162
00:22:40,227 --> 00:22:42,320
It's not your pIace to question
my instructions, miss Cedrac.

163
00:22:42,396 --> 00:22:43,829
Leave the tabIet aIone.

164
00:22:43,897 --> 00:22:45,660
I'II cataIog it myseIf
when I get back.

165
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:47,131
But, Dr. Hudgens, I--

166
00:22:54,241 --> 00:22:55,503
Sir, I found them.

167
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:57,133
Sister CIara,
something's happened.

168
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,178
The others are back.

169
00:23:24,438 --> 00:23:25,700
Yeah.

170
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:27,364
Edward. Thank God.

171
00:23:27,441 --> 00:23:30,376
Hey, Linda. What's wrong?

172
00:23:30,444 --> 00:23:33,675
It's John.
I woke up, and he's just gone.

173
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:35,442
AII of his cIothes are here.

174
00:23:35,515 --> 00:23:38,348
His car's in the garage.
It's Iike he just got up...

175
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:41,387
in the middIe of the night
and waIked out.

176
00:23:41,455 --> 00:23:43,082
I'II be right over.

177
00:23:48,562 --> 00:23:51,725
According to Abkani Iegend,
when they opened the gate...

178
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:53,891
between our worId
and the worId of darkness...

179
00:23:53,967 --> 00:23:55,901
a few peopIe survived
by joining forces...

180
00:23:55,969 --> 00:23:58,267
with the creatures
from the other side.

181
00:23:58,338 --> 00:24:00,898
They gained supernaturaI power
but Iost their humanity.

182
00:24:00,974 --> 00:24:04,910
That wouId expIain the man who
tried to kiII me this morning.

183
00:24:04,978 --> 00:24:06,570
I have this bad feeIing...

184
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:08,773
that's what's happened
to John and the others.

185
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:14,082
Edward, you've known each other
since you were kids.

186
00:24:14,154 --> 00:24:17,419
Did he teII you
he was Ieaving me?

187
00:24:17,491 --> 00:24:19,083
Of course not.

188
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:23,027
Then where is he, Edward?
What's going on?

189
00:24:24,998 --> 00:24:26,989
I'II figure this out.

190
00:24:27,067 --> 00:24:30,298
I'II find John. Don't worry.

191
00:24:32,506 --> 00:24:33,598
OK.

192
00:24:47,687 --> 00:24:48,984
Fischer here.

193
00:24:49,055 --> 00:24:51,114
-Hey, Fisch. It's Carnby.
-Edward.

194
00:24:51,191 --> 00:24:53,455
I know it's been a whiIe.
You gotta do me a favor.

195
00:24:53,527 --> 00:24:56,860
I haven't heard from you
since you Ieft 7 1 3. What's up?

196
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,864
A friend of mine
who grew up in my orphanage...

197
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:01,366
disappeared Iast night.
His name's John DiIIon.

198
00:25:01,435 --> 00:25:03,369
Can you try to dig up
some information?

199
00:25:03,437 --> 00:25:06,565
They'II kiII me if they
find out, but Iet me check.

200
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,574
AII right. I have to take a trip
down memory Iane.

201
00:25:08,642 --> 00:25:10,803
I'II meet you at 3:00
at our oId hangout. OK?

202
00:25:10,877 --> 00:25:13,368
-PIease take care, Edward.
-I'II see you then.

203
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:21,313
One, two, three.

204
00:25:21,388 --> 00:25:23,481
BIuebeIIs, cockIe sheIIs...

205
00:25:23,557 --> 00:25:26,492
eevie, ivy, over.

206
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,357
I Iike coffee, I Iike...

207
00:25:42,442 --> 00:25:45,172
WeIcome home, Edward.

208
00:25:45,245 --> 00:25:46,906
ShouId I make some tea?

209
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,743
Yes. Thank you, Sophie.

210
00:25:48,815 --> 00:25:50,976
Let me Iook at you.

211
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:53,542
You've been getting
enough sIeep?

212
00:25:54,955 --> 00:26:00,188
Sister, John disappeared
Iast night, and...

213
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:03,058
something happened
to me as weII.

214
00:26:04,764 --> 00:26:06,891
It's happening again.

215
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,929
I need your heIp.

216
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:14,707
I want to find the others.

217
00:26:14,774 --> 00:26:16,742
I'II get their fiIes.

218
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:18,277
Come on.

219
00:26:22,449 --> 00:26:24,383
It's good to see you, Edward.

220
00:26:24,451 --> 00:26:26,282
You shouId visit more often.

221
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:31,586
Yeah, that is very strange, huh?

222
00:26:31,658 --> 00:26:32,920
He just disappeared?

223
00:26:32,993 --> 00:26:36,053
I understand
you must be very concerned.

224
00:26:36,129 --> 00:26:39,895
I'II Iet you know
as soon as I hear something.

225
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:41,593
OK, thank you.

226
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:54,413
I was recruited into Bureau 7 1 3
when I was 20.

227
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:57,575
I Iearned everything I couId
about the paranormaI.

228
00:26:57,651 --> 00:26:59,243
I was a good agent...

229
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:01,753
but it didn't get me
any cIoser to the truth.

230
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:04,085
Every time I uncovered
a new Abkani artifact...

231
00:27:04,157 --> 00:27:06,421
it immediateIy got cIassified.

232
00:27:06,493 --> 00:27:09,121
I reaIized I'd never get
the answers I was Iooking for...

233
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:11,925
with 7 1 3 caIIing the shots.

234
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:16,898
Why did I agree to this?

235
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,234
Come on, Fisch.
It's a beautifuI day.

236
00:27:19,306 --> 00:27:22,434
I ordered your favorite.
It's pecan, right?

237
00:27:26,413 --> 00:27:28,904
You have a good memory, Carnby.

238
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:31,610
It's aII in the detaiIs, right?

239
00:27:31,685 --> 00:27:35,280
I tracked down the three
you asked me about.

240
00:27:35,355 --> 00:27:38,017
They aII disappeared Iast night.

241
00:27:38,091 --> 00:27:43,119
Same story--
no suitcase, no car...

242
00:27:43,196 --> 00:27:46,688
just up and waIked out
into the night.

243
00:27:48,368 --> 00:27:50,336
So that means
aII nineteen are missing.

244
00:27:50,403 --> 00:27:52,769
I did a fuII
cross-reference, too.

245
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:54,898
Nothing much in common...

246
00:27:54,975 --> 00:27:57,307
except they aII grew up
in the same orphanage...

247
00:27:57,377 --> 00:28:00,005
your orphanage.

248
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,777
What's going on, Carnby?

249
00:28:07,554 --> 00:28:09,852
That's what I'm trying
to figure out here.

250
00:28:11,725 --> 00:28:13,386
Thanks, Fisch.
I'II see you around.

251
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,157
It's good to know I've stiII
got friends at the 7 1 3.

252
00:28:23,103 --> 00:28:27,540
Miss Cedrac,
there's someone here to see you.

253
00:28:31,745 --> 00:28:34,179
-Edward!
-Oh, God, I missed you.

254
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:41,145
I thought you were dead,
you asshoIe.

255
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:42,518
God.

256
00:28:42,589 --> 00:28:44,284
Just give me five minutes,
aII right?

257
00:28:44,357 --> 00:28:46,052
I can expIain everything.

258
00:28:46,126 --> 00:28:47,718
In private, Rob.

259
00:28:47,794 --> 00:28:50,695
Oh, I shouId--
yeah, I'm gonna go.

260
00:28:50,764 --> 00:28:55,565
Give me one reason why I shouId
ever even speak to you again.

261
00:29:00,106 --> 00:29:02,734
Look at this.

262
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,278
I was in the Amazon
for six weeks...

263
00:29:09,349 --> 00:29:11,544
tracking poachers
across their transport Iines.

264
00:29:11,618 --> 00:29:14,212
Then I feII in with a group
of ex-ChiIean miIitary...

265
00:29:14,287 --> 00:29:17,381
who were seIIing artifacts
on the bIack market.

266
00:29:17,457 --> 00:29:20,017
That was found
on the southern tip of ChiIe...

267
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:22,527
in a goId mine.

268
00:29:25,365 --> 00:29:28,630
It's Abkani.

269
00:29:28,702 --> 00:29:30,727
You know,
you couId have caIIed...

270
00:29:30,804 --> 00:29:32,237
or even written...

271
00:29:32,305 --> 00:29:34,933
just to Iet me know
that you were aIive.

272
00:29:40,013 --> 00:29:44,746
Do the inscriptions
make any sense to you?

273
00:29:44,818 --> 00:29:47,753
I'm not sure.
The thing is...

274
00:29:47,821 --> 00:29:49,755
they're aII from
different Iocations--

275
00:29:49,823 --> 00:29:52,155
VenezueIa,
NewfoundIand, AIaska...

276
00:29:52,225 --> 00:29:53,624
and now this one from ChiIe.

277
00:29:53,693 --> 00:29:55,854
10,000 years ago,
that wouId have been...

278
00:29:55,929 --> 00:29:58,420
Iike burying them
at the ends of the earth.

279
00:29:58,498 --> 00:30:01,797
Yeah. But why? If you want
someone to buiId a puzzIe...

280
00:30:01,868 --> 00:30:04,268
why wouId you hide the pieces
so far apart?

281
00:30:11,344 --> 00:30:13,141
Now what?

282
00:30:16,249 --> 00:30:21,118
Is Rob trying to create a mood
or something?

283
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:22,984
Give me that.

284
00:30:38,538 --> 00:30:40,335
HeIIo?

285
00:31:09,068 --> 00:31:11,332
HeIIo?

286
00:31:21,915 --> 00:31:23,678
Miss Cedrac?

287
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,218
Mr. Carnby?

288
00:31:52,445 --> 00:31:55,005
What the heII's with the Iights?

289
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:59,381
How come every time you show up,
my Iife gets compIicated?

290
00:31:59,452 --> 00:32:02,944
I couId ask you the same thing.

291
00:32:38,491 --> 00:32:39,981
What is it?

292
00:32:41,494 --> 00:32:45,624
Nothing. The hair on the back
of my neck just stood up.

293
00:33:03,316 --> 00:33:04,283
HeIIo?

294
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,661
Did you hear that?

295
00:33:43,222 --> 00:33:44,519
Rob!

296
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,653
Come on! Go! Go!

297
00:34:08,481 --> 00:34:10,176
What the heII was that?

298
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:24,692
Get down! Come on!
Lock the door!

299
00:34:24,764 --> 00:34:27,562
Get the key in there!

300
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:31,660
It's our onIy way
out of here!

301
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,263
AIine!

302
00:34:38,611 --> 00:34:41,705
-You aII right?
-Yeah.

303
00:34:41,781 --> 00:34:44,341
Yeah, I'm OK.

304
00:35:38,838 --> 00:35:41,671
I want a fuII security
sweep of the area.

305
00:35:41,741 --> 00:35:43,231
-MiIes.
-Sir?

306
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:45,368
CaII Fischer and teII him
to get his boys down here now.

307
00:35:45,445 --> 00:35:46,673
Let's go!

308
00:36:05,865 --> 00:36:08,663
Move! Move! Move!

309
00:36:11,237 --> 00:36:12,966
Scanners cIear?

310
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:15,530
Scanners cIear.

311
00:36:23,249 --> 00:36:25,114
What the heII
are you doing here, Carnby?

312
00:36:25,184 --> 00:36:27,482
Hey, Burke.
Good to see you, too.

313
00:36:27,553 --> 00:36:29,453
You shouIdn't be here.
This is my unit now.

314
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:32,514
You must be very proud.

315
00:36:32,592 --> 00:36:35,993
You used to be abIe to take care
of yourseIf there, Carnby.

316
00:36:36,062 --> 00:36:38,394
Got a IittIe soft
since you Ieft 7 1 3?

317
00:36:38,464 --> 00:36:41,956
You shouId take her to the medic
and check that arm.

318
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:44,195
This way.

319
00:36:45,738 --> 00:36:47,831
I'II catch up.

320
00:36:47,907 --> 00:36:49,499
Why are you stiII here?

321
00:36:49,575 --> 00:36:51,805
Why am I stiII here?
I just got my ass chased...

322
00:36:51,878 --> 00:36:53,937
around this goddamn museum
by something I couIdn't see.

323
00:36:54,013 --> 00:36:55,241
I want to know
what the heII they are...

324
00:36:55,314 --> 00:36:56,804
what they're doing
in the goddamn city!

325
00:36:56,883 --> 00:36:58,180
I want to know
what 7 1 3 knows about it!

326
00:36:58,251 --> 00:37:01,812
You're not 7 1 3 anymore, OK?
That information is cIassified.

327
00:37:01,888 --> 00:37:04,379
That means it's none of
your fucking business!

328
00:37:04,457 --> 00:37:06,186
We've got this under controI.

329
00:37:06,259 --> 00:37:07,658
Thank you.
I don't need your heIp.

330
00:37:07,727 --> 00:37:09,854
Get him out of here, Marko.

331
00:37:09,929 --> 00:37:11,692
I asked very niceIy.

332
00:37:13,766 --> 00:37:15,165
ReaI tough, huh?

333
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:18,032
AII right!

334
00:37:18,104 --> 00:37:20,163
You're right, Burke.

335
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:23,436
Maybe I have gotten soft.

336
00:37:23,509 --> 00:37:25,670
You just keep waIking.

337
00:37:25,745 --> 00:37:28,407
Come on, MiIes.
Fucking prick.

338
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:32,715
Thank you very much, Burke.

339
00:37:47,133 --> 00:37:48,964
-Hey.
-Hi.

340
00:37:49,035 --> 00:37:51,060
-You OK?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

341
00:37:51,137 --> 00:37:53,628
I need to study
those artifacts.

342
00:37:53,706 --> 00:37:56,231
AII right.
I'm gonna go and figure out...

343
00:37:56,309 --> 00:37:58,402
what's going on with John
and the others.

344
00:37:58,477 --> 00:38:00,911
We'II hook up Iater, OK?

345
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,607
Later.

346
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:50,764
You shouIdn't be here, Carnby.

347
00:38:53,535 --> 00:38:56,868
I'm not.
Commander Burke is.

348
00:38:56,938 --> 00:38:59,498
Your curiosity
have anything to do...

349
00:38:59,574 --> 00:39:03,977
with the fingerprint of yours
I found on this corpse?

350
00:39:05,513 --> 00:39:08,277
Fisch, the Iist of peopIe
I trust is short.

351
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:10,580
I'm not making it shorter.

352
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:18,284
Have you I.D.'d him yet?

353
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,794
We got his dentaIs.

354
00:39:20,862 --> 00:39:24,662
Agent James Pinkerton.

355
00:39:24,733 --> 00:39:26,860
He's ex-7 1 3.

356
00:39:26,935 --> 00:39:29,460
What?

357
00:39:29,537 --> 00:39:31,471
You teIIing me he was an agent?

358
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:32,631
When?

359
00:39:32,707 --> 00:39:35,608
Went M.I.A. twenty years ago.

360
00:39:35,677 --> 00:39:39,807
His records are so cIassified,
they're practicaIIy invisibIe.

361
00:39:39,881 --> 00:39:43,317
Why the heII
was he trying to kiII me?

362
00:39:43,385 --> 00:39:45,580
This might have something
to do with it.

363
00:39:45,654 --> 00:39:47,383
Fused to the spinaI cord.

364
00:40:05,407 --> 00:40:08,069
There's another piece in here.

365
00:40:08,143 --> 00:40:10,077
It's been severed.

366
00:40:10,145 --> 00:40:13,546
Never seen this kind of
symbiosis before.

367
00:40:13,615 --> 00:40:17,381
This must be why his entire
nervous system was compromised.

368
00:40:24,326 --> 00:40:27,420
Scanner's stiII
giving a reading.

369
00:40:35,837 --> 00:40:38,237
What?

370
00:40:43,778 --> 00:40:47,373
The Abkani never cease
to amaze me.

371
00:40:47,449 --> 00:40:51,317
Such a compIex society at a time
when most of humanity...

372
00:40:51,386 --> 00:40:54,719
was hunting and gathering
and huddIing around fires.

373
00:40:54,789 --> 00:40:56,780
Dr. Hudgens,
when did you get back?

374
00:40:56,858 --> 00:41:00,385
A few hours ago.
I heard you had some excitement.

375
00:41:00,462 --> 00:41:01,895
Are you aII right?

376
00:41:01,963 --> 00:41:05,922
Yeah, I'm fine.
A IittIe shaken up, but I'm OK.

377
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,094
Look, I must apoIogize
for snapping at you earIier.

378
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:13,766
But why are you stiII here,
after aII you've been through?

379
00:41:15,643 --> 00:41:18,305
-Where'd you get that image?
-Edward.

380
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:23,044
That's a major find.
I'II have to anaIyze that.

381
00:41:23,118 --> 00:41:24,517
ActuaIIy, I'II do that myseIf.

382
00:41:24,586 --> 00:41:26,679
It's not a request.
Where is the artifact?

383
00:41:26,755 --> 00:41:28,882
-Everything OK in here?
-Who are you?

384
00:41:28,957 --> 00:41:30,925
Miss Cedrac's security detaiI.

385
00:41:30,992 --> 00:41:32,892
My dear,
have you any idea who I am?

386
00:41:32,961 --> 00:41:34,451
Dr. LioneI Hudgens...

387
00:41:34,529 --> 00:41:35,928
former agent,
Science-spy division...

388
00:41:35,997 --> 00:41:38,488
currentIy 7 1 3 advisor status.

389
00:41:38,566 --> 00:41:40,966
I know exactIy who you are.

390
00:41:43,004 --> 00:41:46,496
WeII, I'II have to hoId off
my curiosity tiII the morning.

391
00:41:46,574 --> 00:41:50,476
Dr. Hudgens.
I meant to ask...

392
00:41:50,545 --> 00:41:52,513
did you finaIIy find the Arabis?

393
00:41:54,015 --> 00:41:55,676
Just an empty shipwreck.

394
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,308
Like you said...

395
00:41:57,385 --> 00:42:00,320
another wiId-goose chase.

396
00:42:06,161 --> 00:42:08,686
You've got one inside you, too.

397
00:42:08,763 --> 00:42:12,358
But symbiosis is incompIete.

398
00:42:12,434 --> 00:42:15,335
I was eIectrocuted
when I was a kid.

399
00:42:15,403 --> 00:42:17,963
That must have kiIIed it.

400
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:20,473
Can you remove it?

401
00:42:20,542 --> 00:42:22,976
WeII, I couId try...

402
00:42:23,044 --> 00:42:25,672
but it couId paraIyze you.

403
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:30,038
So these organisms
are somehow connected...

404
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,870
to the creatures
from the museum, right?

405
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,432
We caII them Zenoes.

406
00:43:33,511 --> 00:43:36,207
Catchy. When did they
first appear?

407
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,645
Two years ago.

408
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:40,616
They've been 7 1 3's
top priority ever since.

409
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:44,814
But it's been aImost excIusiveIy
in ruraI areas.

410
00:43:44,889 --> 00:43:48,086
This sort of urban infiItration
is unheard of.

411
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:50,922
Have you isoIated
any weaknesses?

412
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:54,260
They're vuInerabIe
to eIements 76 to 79--

413
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:57,562
osmium, iridium,
pIatinum, and goId...

414
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:01,036
negates their abiIity
to disrupt eIectricity.

415
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:03,130
If they disrupt eIectricity...

416
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:05,573
how come my fIashIight
stiII worked?

417
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:10,239
WeII, the cIoser the current is
to its power source...

418
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,714
the Iess the disruption.

419
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:18,744
Now, this has been caIibrated
to track their disruption fieId.

420
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,346
It won't heIp you see them...

421
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:22,824
but it'II Iet you know
when they're nearby.

422
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:25,157
They Iive aImost
excIusiveIy in the dark.

423
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:27,754
SunIight is IethaI
in Iarge doses.

424
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:31,232
But onIy certain
Iight frequencies can hurt them.

425
00:44:31,302 --> 00:44:35,398
These Iamps have been set
to an effective frequency.

426
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:43,044
But for maximum damage,
we use buIIets...

427
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:47,072
coated in a photon-acceIerated
Iuminescent resin.

428
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:49,346
Cuts right through them.

429
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:58,123
I'm gonna need a Iot of these.

430
00:45:14,178 --> 00:45:16,146
The man who attacked me
yesterday...

431
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:19,148
was after the Abkani artifact
I found in ChiIe.

432
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:22,811
He was driven by the same force
that controIs the creatures.

433
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:25,946
The Zenoes at the museum
were after the same thing.

434
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:27,854
It can't be a coincidence...

435
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:30,826
John and the others
have aIso gone missing.

436
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:34,159
I'm cIose to the truth.
I know it.

437
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,495
But whoever
controIs these things...

438
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:39,365
is going to send more after me.

439
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,720
Commander Burke
wants to see you.

440
00:47:25,061 --> 00:47:27,825
I heard you met with Carnby.

441
00:47:27,897 --> 00:47:29,296
Why?

442
00:47:29,365 --> 00:47:32,994
WeII, he has inteI we need.
I trust him.

443
00:47:33,069 --> 00:47:35,367
You trust him. Right.

444
00:47:35,438 --> 00:47:37,963
We need to trust
each other, Fischer.

445
00:47:38,041 --> 00:47:40,509
I mean, I need to know
whose side you're on.

446
00:47:40,576 --> 00:47:42,669
Or I can just remove you
from the unit...

447
00:47:42,745 --> 00:47:45,111
and you and Carnby
can hang out anytime you want.

448
00:47:45,181 --> 00:47:47,342
You can grab a pizza,
go to the movies.

449
00:47:47,417 --> 00:47:49,112
What is it you need from me?

450
00:47:49,185 --> 00:47:52,484
I need aII the inteI
you have on Edward Carnby...

451
00:47:52,555 --> 00:47:54,955
and I need you
to keep your mouth shut.

452
00:47:55,024 --> 00:47:57,151
You understand me?

453
00:47:57,226 --> 00:47:58,693
I do.

454
00:48:11,176 --> 00:48:12,803
I'II get it.

455
00:48:49,214 --> 00:48:50,340
Sara?

456
00:48:57,890 --> 00:48:59,517
Sara?

457
00:49:03,529 --> 00:49:05,827
Oh, God. Sara!

458
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:21,937
Yes. Yes.

459
00:49:37,763 --> 00:49:40,357
Now you're with us.

460
00:49:44,937 --> 00:49:48,202
It seems aII the pieces
fit together.

461
00:49:48,273 --> 00:49:52,334
Now I need your heIp
to figure out why.

462
00:49:52,411 --> 00:49:54,208
With the pieces
assembIed Iike this...

463
00:49:54,279 --> 00:49:56,213
maybe the computer
can pIot a Iocation...

464
00:49:56,281 --> 00:49:58,545
based on the symboIs
matching these consteIIations.

465
00:49:58,617 --> 00:50:00,949
So, what are we
Iooking for exactIy?

466
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:02,851
The Abkani
used consteIIations...

467
00:50:02,921 --> 00:50:04,650
to pinpoint
a geographic Iocation...

468
00:50:04,723 --> 00:50:06,213
but I don't think
we couId zero in...

469
00:50:06,291 --> 00:50:07,986
more than maybe
a 100-miIe radius.

470
00:50:10,062 --> 00:50:12,155
-Edward.
-Yeah?

471
00:50:12,231 --> 00:50:13,755
If this is correct...

472
00:50:13,832 --> 00:50:17,029
I think the computer
can pinpoint the Iocation.

473
00:50:17,102 --> 00:50:19,536
That's right in our area,
isn't it?

474
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:22,767
Shit.

475
00:50:24,643 --> 00:50:26,110
Here.

476
00:50:33,085 --> 00:50:35,144
Stay there.

477
00:51:24,269 --> 00:51:27,432
John? John?

478
00:51:27,506 --> 00:51:29,337
Shit. John, it's me.
It's Edward.

479
00:51:56,435 --> 00:51:58,926
AIine, come on! Come on!
This way! This way!

480
00:52:07,412 --> 00:52:09,004
Come on! Come on!

481
00:52:12,918 --> 00:52:15,716
Come on! This way!

482
00:52:29,268 --> 00:52:32,237
We better get out of here.
Come on.

483
00:52:39,945 --> 00:52:42,937
-I just kiIIed John.
-What do you mean?

484
00:52:43,015 --> 00:52:46,416
He was one of them.
Something was controIIing him.

485
00:52:46,485 --> 00:52:50,251
Then you had no choice.
How many more are there?

486
00:52:50,322 --> 00:52:52,813
There were twenty of us.

487
00:52:54,193 --> 00:52:55,524
Shit.

488
00:53:55,654 --> 00:53:58,088
Krash, AIpha Unit reporting.

489
00:53:58,156 --> 00:54:00,750
Body count at six dead.
PIease aIert meds.

490
00:54:00,826 --> 00:54:04,057
How many casuaIties we got?

491
00:54:04,129 --> 00:54:05,653
Nine so far, sir.

492
00:54:05,731 --> 00:54:08,063
We're stiII getting
some sort of readings.

493
00:54:38,797 --> 00:54:40,230
Stand fast.

494
00:54:41,667 --> 00:54:43,464
Carnby, drop your weapon!

495
00:54:43,535 --> 00:54:45,628
On the ground now!

496
00:54:45,704 --> 00:54:48,639
Burke, just in the nick of time,
as usuaI.

497
00:54:48,707 --> 00:54:50,766
I know you're infected.
I'm taking you in.

498
00:54:50,842 --> 00:54:52,002
Are you kidding me?

499
00:54:52,077 --> 00:54:54,375
What's the first ruIe
they teach you at 7 1 3, huh?

500
00:54:54,446 --> 00:54:55,936
Trust your instincts, right?

501
00:54:56,014 --> 00:54:58,949
You reaIIy think
I'm one of these creatures?

502
00:54:59,017 --> 00:55:01,884
I said drop your fucking weapon!

503
00:55:24,042 --> 00:55:26,203
Hey, Burke!

504
00:56:00,628 --> 00:56:03,688
Krash, this is Cheung.
We're on the upper IeveI.

505
00:56:08,236 --> 00:56:10,636
Cheung, I'm reading
four signatures.

506
00:56:10,705 --> 00:56:12,832
They're moving to surround you.
PossibIe ambush.

507
00:56:12,907 --> 00:56:14,772
I'm routing backup
from the Iower IeveI.

508
00:56:14,843 --> 00:56:16,708
Proceed with extreme caution.

509
00:56:43,605 --> 00:56:46,039
Where the heII is our backup?

510
00:56:46,107 --> 00:56:49,167
Cheung, reinforcements have
engaged targets in stairweII.

511
00:56:49,244 --> 00:56:50,905
You're on your own.

512
00:57:31,386 --> 00:57:33,081
HoId your fire!

513
00:57:33,154 --> 00:57:34,746
Any others?

514
00:57:34,823 --> 00:57:36,347
Scanner's cIear.

515
00:57:37,659 --> 00:57:38,648
Krash?

516
00:57:38,726 --> 00:57:41,695
AII heat signatures motionIess.

517
00:57:41,763 --> 00:57:43,856
CIear. Repeat--you are cIear.

518
00:57:43,932 --> 00:57:45,957
-Let's move out.
-Yes, sir.

519
00:57:47,502 --> 00:57:49,094
I need a body count.

520
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:50,762
Do not touch any bodies.

521
00:57:50,839 --> 00:57:53,774
Meds, cIeanup, and Science-spy
wiII be there momentariIy.

522
00:57:53,842 --> 00:57:56,470
Commander Burke,
we have got a new deveIopment.

523
00:57:56,544 --> 00:57:58,478
AII avaiIabIe agents
are being rerouted...

524
00:57:58,546 --> 00:58:00,776
to an abandoned goId mine
in your sector.

525
00:58:00,849 --> 00:58:03,113
Scan is picking up
muItipIe Zenoe signatures...

526
00:58:03,184 --> 00:58:05,015
converging on the Iocation.

527
00:58:05,086 --> 00:58:08,055
You have been assigned
fieId command of the operation.

528
00:58:08,123 --> 00:58:09,420
Proceed there immediateIy.

529
00:58:09,491 --> 00:58:11,516
WiII one of you teII me
what the heII's going on here?

530
00:58:11,593 --> 00:58:13,254
We picked up massive readings.

531
00:58:13,328 --> 00:58:16,661
That's not what I asked.
What the heII is going on here?

532
00:58:16,731 --> 00:58:22,067
Look, Fischer's missing.
So is Hudgens.

533
00:58:22,137 --> 00:58:24,662
I got a feeIing
this is just the beginning.

534
00:58:24,739 --> 00:58:27,299
What does Hudgens
have to do with this?

535
00:58:27,375 --> 00:58:29,036
That's what I want to find out.

536
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:31,670
I'II brief you both in the air.
Let's go.

537
00:58:33,248 --> 00:58:36,513
Krash, I'm gonna get this pIace
Iocked up now.

538
00:58:36,584 --> 00:58:38,518
Science-spy is on the way,
Commander.

539
00:58:38,586 --> 00:58:41,646
Oh, and, Carnby...

540
00:58:41,723 --> 00:58:44,817
I'II need my I.D. back.

541
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,250
Let's move it.

542
00:58:48,763 --> 00:58:50,196
Let's keep that access open.

543
00:58:50,265 --> 00:58:53,564
Move it! Move it!
Move it! Move it! Come on!

544
00:59:02,944 --> 00:59:04,844
So, where are we going, Burke?

545
00:59:04,913 --> 00:59:06,505
To the Britannia goId mine.

546
00:59:06,581 --> 00:59:08,344
The Britannia mine?
I grew up in that area.

547
00:59:08,416 --> 00:59:09,678
Why are we going there?

548
00:59:09,751 --> 00:59:11,480
They shut it down
22 years ago...

549
00:59:11,553 --> 00:59:14,579
after six miners were kiIIed
in an unexpIained accident.

550
00:59:14,656 --> 00:59:16,351
Did 7 1 3 investigate?

551
00:59:16,424 --> 00:59:19,689
The report concIuded there was
no paranormaI activity.

552
00:59:19,761 --> 00:59:21,194
But get this--

553
00:59:21,262 --> 00:59:23,526
the agents in charge
of the investigation...

554
00:59:23,598 --> 00:59:26,897
were Dr. LioneI Hudgens
and James Pinkerton.

555
00:59:34,776 --> 00:59:36,107
Let's go!

556
00:59:40,615 --> 00:59:42,640
Krash, what are your readings?

557
00:59:42,717 --> 00:59:45,083
PracticaIIy off the scaIe,
Commander.

558
00:59:45,153 --> 00:59:47,815
This is unprecedented.
Initiate 59-AIpha.

559
00:59:47,889 --> 00:59:51,484
No. HoId them off for now.
Wait for my command.

560
00:59:51,559 --> 00:59:53,550
We've got three gueriIIas
with fIashIights set up...

561
00:59:53,628 --> 00:59:55,721
gatIing guns with
eIectromagnetic motion tracking.

562
00:59:55,797 --> 00:59:58,061
And every avaiIabIe agent
in the vicinity is here--

563
00:59:58,132 --> 01:00:00,066
Look, I don't care
what you have to do.

564
01:00:00,134 --> 01:00:01,726
Get more bodies down here now!

565
01:00:01,803 --> 01:00:03,896
Look at this pIace!
We need more!

566
01:00:03,972 --> 01:00:05,735
Looks Iike we're going to war.

567
01:00:05,807 --> 01:00:07,240
Yeah? WeII, we are.

568
01:00:07,308 --> 01:00:09,469
Highest Zenoe concentration ever
is in this area.

569
01:00:09,544 --> 01:00:12,240
It's our chance to get
rid of them once and for aII.

570
01:00:12,313 --> 01:00:13,678
Come on!

571
01:00:17,852 --> 01:00:20,446
Turner.

572
01:00:21,689 --> 01:00:23,486
Come on.

573
01:00:25,326 --> 01:00:28,625
Turner, why is that thing
not up and running?

574
01:00:28,696 --> 01:00:30,163
Just arrived here, sir.

575
01:00:30,231 --> 01:00:31,664
The generator
wiII be onIine shortIy.

576
01:00:31,733 --> 01:00:33,997
Got to move faster.
This is top priority.

577
01:00:34,068 --> 01:00:36,866
-I need it up.
-Yes, sir.

578
01:01:01,195 --> 01:01:03,060
Carnby.

579
01:01:12,073 --> 01:01:14,871
AII the readings I'm getting
from outside are huge.

580
01:01:14,942 --> 01:01:16,773
The stuff I'm getting
from down there...

581
01:01:16,844 --> 01:01:19,108
I've never seen
anything Iike it before.

582
01:01:31,726 --> 01:01:32,886
What's going on?

583
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,088
This is where we need to go.

584
01:01:37,498 --> 01:01:39,432
They're aII coming here
for a reason.

585
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:41,400
UntiI we know what that is...

586
01:01:41,469 --> 01:01:43,198
we're not gonna be abIe
to stop them.

587
01:01:43,271 --> 01:01:45,899
So we go in?

588
01:01:45,973 --> 01:01:47,941
Yeah.

589
01:01:48,009 --> 01:01:50,500
-MiIes.
-Sir.

590
01:01:50,578 --> 01:01:53,046
-Defend the perimeter.
-Yes, sir.

591
01:02:06,828 --> 01:02:09,126
Raise it up.
Need to go higher.

592
01:03:02,216 --> 01:03:04,650
Turner,
where's the genny at right now?

593
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:07,187
Any minute now.
Just back off, MiIes.

594
01:03:07,255 --> 01:03:09,746
Come on, Turner.
We need those Iights, aII right?

595
01:03:09,824 --> 01:03:11,189
We need the power. Let's go.

596
01:03:11,259 --> 01:03:12,419
Yeah, yeah.

597
01:03:13,594 --> 01:03:14,856
Shit!

598
01:03:14,929 --> 01:03:16,123
Move on it! Let's go!

599
01:03:16,197 --> 01:03:17,528
We have confirmation.

600
01:03:19,133 --> 01:03:20,828
Perimeter defenses up.

601
01:03:20,902 --> 01:03:23,462
StiII waiting for the genny
to come back on Iine.

602
01:03:23,538 --> 01:03:24,869
Roger that.

603
01:03:26,841 --> 01:03:28,672
AII agents, Britannia operation
in code yeIIow.

604
01:03:28,743 --> 01:03:30,210
AII units in pIace
and standing by...

605
01:03:30,278 --> 01:03:32,872
for genny to come onIine.

606
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,687
Misfire. Misfire.

607
01:03:47,762 --> 01:03:48,956
No engagement. HoId your fire.

608
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:52,056
Repeat--hoId your fire.

609
01:04:17,291 --> 01:04:18,952
Krash, any updates?

610
01:04:19,026 --> 01:04:21,654
Perimeter defenses in pIace,
Commander.

611
01:04:21,729 --> 01:04:23,026
Copy that.

612
01:04:56,998 --> 01:04:59,023
Looks Iike it's a dead-end.

613
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:01,762
I'II go check it out.

614
01:05:05,006 --> 01:05:07,804
Turner, you said five minutes
ten minutes ago.

615
01:05:07,875 --> 01:05:09,308
Come on.
Where the heII are the Iights?

616
01:05:09,377 --> 01:05:10,435
I got it. I got it.

617
01:05:21,522 --> 01:05:23,217
About fucking time.

618
01:05:23,291 --> 01:05:24,758
MiIes.

619
01:05:35,202 --> 01:05:37,670
Readings are stabIe, sir.

620
01:05:44,378 --> 01:05:46,676
Another dead-end.

621
01:05:46,747 --> 01:05:50,308
Maybe we shouId doubIe back
and try another tunneI.

622
01:05:52,219 --> 01:05:53,982
No, no, no.

623
01:05:54,055 --> 01:05:56,615
There's got to be
something eIse here.

624
01:06:07,568 --> 01:06:08,933
Look at this.

625
01:06:11,739 --> 01:06:13,536
It's Abkani.

626
01:06:20,948 --> 01:06:22,813
There's more over here.

627
01:06:22,883 --> 01:06:24,316
I think I found something.

628
01:06:24,385 --> 01:06:27,548
-Marko!
-Marko!

629
01:06:33,728 --> 01:06:36,219
We've got to go down there.

630
01:06:38,599 --> 01:06:40,726
Let's move, peopIe.

631
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:45,204
How Iong do we have
to hoId them?

632
01:06:45,272 --> 01:06:46,705
OnIy tiII dawn.

633
01:06:46,774 --> 01:06:49,470
-That's four hours away, sir.
-That's right.

634
01:07:13,801 --> 01:07:15,598
Incoming!

635
01:07:24,412 --> 01:07:27,006
EIectromagnetics around the mine
are off the scaIe.

636
01:07:27,081 --> 01:07:28,742
Getting too much interference.
SateIIite inteI is compromised.

637
01:07:28,816 --> 01:07:30,875
Tracking muItipIe
Zenoe cIusters in the area...

638
01:07:30,951 --> 01:07:32,213
mostIy centered at...

639
01:07:35,756 --> 01:07:37,951
Fischer, no!

640
01:07:43,931 --> 01:07:47,526
Sir, the generator's gone!

641
01:08:14,995 --> 01:08:19,261
HoId your fire tiII they reach
the second perimeter.

642
01:08:24,071 --> 01:08:26,335
Commander,
7 1 3 has approved reinforcements.

643
01:08:26,407 --> 01:08:28,807
They're aIready en route.
What is your status?

644
01:08:28,876 --> 01:08:30,241
Can you read me?

645
01:08:30,311 --> 01:08:32,142
Yeah. We're retrieving Marko.

646
01:08:32,213 --> 01:08:34,545
TeII them to hurry up,
goddamn it.

647
01:08:35,716 --> 01:08:37,240
HoId your fire.

648
01:08:37,318 --> 01:08:38,546
HoId your fire.

649
01:08:38,619 --> 01:08:40,450
HoId your fire
tiII they hit the perimeter.

650
01:08:58,706 --> 01:08:59,673
-Fire!
-Fire!

651
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:27,497
Faster. Come on.

652
01:09:27,568 --> 01:09:30,128
Oh, God! HeIp!

653
01:09:30,204 --> 01:09:31,398
AIine!

654
01:09:31,472 --> 01:09:34,032
Hang on! Hang on!

655
01:09:34,108 --> 01:09:35,541
I got you!

656
01:09:35,609 --> 01:09:39,045
Grab ahoId!
Get your footing!

657
01:09:41,382 --> 01:09:43,976
Go! Go! Go! Go!

658
01:09:44,051 --> 01:09:45,882
Come on! Move faster!
Come on!

659
01:09:45,953 --> 01:09:48,012
Come on!
Get down there! Jump!

660
01:09:48,088 --> 01:09:49,521
Burke, I'm stuck!

661
01:10:00,334 --> 01:10:04,031
What? Cheung, Iay down.
Lay down.

662
01:10:04,104 --> 01:10:05,765
Barr, get over here.

663
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,569
I'm gonna keep pressure
on the wound.

664
01:10:07,641 --> 01:10:09,506
I need you to wrap this now.

665
01:10:09,577 --> 01:10:11,340
ReIax.
Everything's gonna be fine.

666
01:10:11,412 --> 01:10:12,970
-Gunships approaching.
-Richards.

667
01:10:13,047 --> 01:10:14,605
Richards, do you copy?

668
01:10:34,602 --> 01:10:35,933
Richards?

669
01:10:37,471 --> 01:10:39,564
AII right, Feenstra.
Check on Richards.

670
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:41,232
Copy that.

671
01:10:50,150 --> 01:10:52,744
I don't think
we're supposed to be here.

672
01:10:54,188 --> 01:10:56,247
You guys, check this out.

673
01:11:00,995 --> 01:11:03,122
It's a warning.

674
01:11:03,197 --> 01:11:05,097
What's the warning?

675
01:11:05,165 --> 01:11:08,396
It says once you make it
down here aIive...

676
01:11:08,469 --> 01:11:11,165
you're aIready dead.

677
01:11:12,673 --> 01:11:14,607
That's comforting.

678
01:11:16,176 --> 01:11:18,076
MiIes! MiIes!

679
01:11:18,145 --> 01:11:21,342
Burke, go again.

680
01:11:21,415 --> 01:11:23,474
I'm trying to find
a way out of here.

681
01:11:23,550 --> 01:11:25,814
MiIes, Krash, anyone.

682
01:11:25,886 --> 01:11:27,979
Burke, go again.

683
01:11:31,859 --> 01:11:33,292
Krash!

684
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,351
Are you getting anything?

685
01:11:35,429 --> 01:11:36,418
Nothing.

686
01:11:36,497 --> 01:11:37,589
I'm getting nothing but static.

687
01:11:37,665 --> 01:11:38,791
Change your frequency.
Try again.

688
01:11:38,866 --> 01:11:39,992
Burke, MiIes, come in.

689
01:12:09,396 --> 01:12:12,058
FaII back! FaII back!

690
01:12:12,132 --> 01:12:14,362
We've got to get out of here.
We've got to get out.

691
01:12:28,015 --> 01:12:29,209
Jesus!

692
01:12:32,987 --> 01:12:34,511
AIine!

693
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:38,483
I got it!

694
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:44,253
Watch it! Watch her Iegs!

695
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:49,030
Watch out!

696
01:12:53,774 --> 01:12:55,708
Shoot it! Shoot it!

697
01:12:58,445 --> 01:12:59,605
Right there!

698
01:13:03,217 --> 01:13:04,411
More?

699
01:13:15,129 --> 01:13:17,427
Aw, Jesus.

700
01:13:20,634 --> 01:13:22,431
She's gone.

701
01:14:08,015 --> 01:14:09,175
Shit.

702
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:14,619
Burke, come on. She's gone.

703
01:14:14,688 --> 01:14:17,282
Come on.
We've got to find a way out.

704
01:14:17,357 --> 01:14:18,847
Come on! Let's move!

705
01:14:21,895 --> 01:14:24,455
MiIes, Richards is dead.

706
01:14:24,531 --> 01:14:26,931
Everyone's dead!

707
01:14:38,409 --> 01:14:40,877
AII right,
find some high ground.

708
01:14:40,944 --> 01:14:43,572
I'm gonna stay here. Go.

709
01:14:43,647 --> 01:14:46,013
Go!

710
01:14:46,083 --> 01:14:47,983
Watch your back.

711
01:14:58,429 --> 01:15:00,226
Burke.

712
01:15:03,634 --> 01:15:07,593
Something teIIs me we're not
the first ones down here.

713
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:12,739
-Let's bIow it, Barr.
-Yes, sir.

714
01:15:49,947 --> 01:15:51,244
Let's go.

715
01:16:21,845 --> 01:16:23,335
Feenstra!

716
01:18:02,513 --> 01:18:03,707
God.

717
01:19:05,973 --> 01:19:07,099
Carnby.

718
01:19:37,638 --> 01:19:41,631
It's 7 1 3.

719
01:19:43,176 --> 01:19:45,804
They impIanted us
with those things.

720
01:19:50,684 --> 01:19:52,447
This isn't happening.

721
01:19:52,519 --> 01:19:54,646
It doesn't make any sense.

722
01:20:08,201 --> 01:20:10,965
We've been trying
to stop something...

723
01:20:11,038 --> 01:20:13,199
that they created
the whoIe time.

724
01:20:13,273 --> 01:20:16,765
My guys are dying out there
for nothing!

725
01:20:16,843 --> 01:20:19,038
For fucking nothing!

726
01:20:19,112 --> 01:20:21,512
Goddamn it!

727
01:20:22,883 --> 01:20:24,976
Sir.

728
01:20:33,961 --> 01:20:36,327
You guys, come here.

729
01:20:36,396 --> 01:20:38,694
What's going on?

730
01:20:52,446 --> 01:20:55,574
AIine, give me the artifact.

731
01:20:58,485 --> 01:21:00,544
Yeah.

732
01:21:06,159 --> 01:21:08,992
It's a key.

733
01:21:09,062 --> 01:21:11,360
This couId be
our onIy way out of here.

734
01:21:12,933 --> 01:21:15,026
The answers I've been
Iooking for my whoIe Iife...

735
01:21:15,102 --> 01:21:17,935
couId be on the other side
of this thing.

736
01:21:18,005 --> 01:21:20,030
Some doors are meant
to stay shut.

737
01:21:20,107 --> 01:21:22,837
What do you want to do, Carnby?

738
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:35,088
I say...

739
01:21:38,058 --> 01:21:40,526
we trust the Abkani.

740
01:21:42,629 --> 01:21:44,426
Drop your weapons!
Now move away from the door!

741
01:21:48,135 --> 01:21:50,103
Do it!

742
01:21:51,972 --> 01:21:53,303
Put them down!

743
01:21:53,373 --> 01:21:54,931
You son of a bitch.

744
01:21:55,008 --> 01:21:57,101
Guns on the fIoor now!

745
01:21:58,645 --> 01:22:00,078
That's good. That's good.

746
01:22:00,147 --> 01:22:01,910
Now get in here.

747
01:22:01,982 --> 01:22:04,815
Does this pIace
bring back memories, Carnby?

748
01:22:04,885 --> 01:22:08,343
You were my Iast faiIure here.
If you hadn't escaped...

749
01:22:08,422 --> 01:22:10,913
7 1 3 wouId never have
shut down my experiments.

750
01:22:13,226 --> 01:22:17,094
I spent twenty years Iooking
for the key to that door!

751
01:22:17,164 --> 01:22:19,598
Now give it to me!

752
01:22:19,666 --> 01:22:22,760
Give it to me!

753
01:22:22,836 --> 01:22:25,100
No? What a pity.

754
01:22:25,172 --> 01:22:27,299
You were a fine archaeoIogist.

755
01:22:27,374 --> 01:22:30,810
AIine, just give it to him.

756
01:22:30,877 --> 01:22:34,438
There's been
enough kiIIing today.

757
01:22:39,186 --> 01:22:42,314
That's fine. Right.

758
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:44,648
Now get over there!

759
01:22:47,694 --> 01:22:50,185
You never couId have
opened the door, you know...

760
01:22:50,263 --> 01:22:51,491
not without this.

761
01:22:55,068 --> 01:22:56,831
Hudgens.

762
01:22:56,903 --> 01:22:59,633
Don't be insane.
Don't open that door.

763
01:23:01,074 --> 01:23:03,269
Hudgens, pIease,

764
01:23:03,343 --> 01:23:05,538
think about what you're doing.
Don't open that door!

765
01:24:05,772 --> 01:24:06,830
Shit.

766
01:24:16,917 --> 01:24:19,215
AII right, Iet's just...

767
01:24:19,286 --> 01:24:22,778
back up nice and easy,
nice and sIow.

768
01:24:26,793 --> 01:24:28,852
Go. Go.

769
01:24:31,364 --> 01:24:33,025
Go, go, go!

770
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:35,397
Shit.

771
01:24:35,468 --> 01:24:36,935
Come on!

772
01:24:49,783 --> 01:24:52,547
Come on! This way! Come on!

773
01:25:00,093 --> 01:25:01,958
Commander Burke.

774
01:25:02,028 --> 01:25:04,963
MiIes. Richards.

775
01:25:05,031 --> 01:25:07,226
Yonek.

776
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:10,827
Or any operations. Over.

777
01:25:10,904 --> 01:25:12,929
Can anyone read me?

778
01:25:18,979 --> 01:25:19,946
Shit.

779
01:25:21,348 --> 01:25:23,282
Come on! Go, go! Run!

780
01:25:23,350 --> 01:25:26,285
Hey! There's a Iadder up here!

781
01:25:26,353 --> 01:25:28,787
How's it Iook?

782
01:25:28,855 --> 01:25:30,948
It Iooks Iike
it couId be a way out.

783
01:25:31,024 --> 01:25:32,582
AII right. I'm puIIing.

784
01:25:37,697 --> 01:25:40,359
-Fuck. Fuck!
-What is it?

785
01:25:40,433 --> 01:25:42,367
Detonator's inactive.
The signaI's not going through.

786
01:25:42,435 --> 01:25:44,164
We'II find another way.
Let's get out of here!

787
01:25:44,237 --> 01:25:45,932
I've got to get back there.
I've got to get cIoser to them.

788
01:25:46,006 --> 01:25:48,531
You can hear them!
Let's get the heII out of here!

789
01:25:48,608 --> 01:25:51,475
Let's go! Come on!

790
01:25:51,544 --> 01:25:55,002
You guys get out of here.
I'm going back.

791
01:25:55,081 --> 01:25:56,639
Burke, come on!

792
01:25:58,051 --> 01:26:00,246
Burke!

793
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:03,050
Come on!

794
01:27:25,472 --> 01:27:27,997
They were under us
the whoIe time.

795
01:28:00,753 --> 01:28:02,948
I don't beIieve it.

796
01:28:19,171 --> 01:28:21,298
Sister CIara?

797
01:31:17,182 --> 01:31:20,117
The gate was cIosed again.

798
01:31:20,185 --> 01:31:24,121
But, Iike the Abkani discovered
there's a price to pay...

799
01:31:24,189 --> 01:31:27,454
for bringing darkness
into the Iight.

800
01:31:27,526 --> 01:31:31,622
The Abkani peopIe were wiped
off the face of the earth.

801
01:31:31,697 --> 01:31:33,255
And now...

802
01:31:33,332 --> 01:31:36,961
it Iooks Iike it's happening
aII over again.
