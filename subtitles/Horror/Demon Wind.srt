00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:15,343
J1 are you washed in the
blood of the lamb?

2
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,723
J1 are you washed in the blood

3
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:26,980
j1 in the soul-cleansing
blood of the lamb?

4
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:31,651
J1 are your garments spotless?

5
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,821
J1 are they white as snow?

6
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:39,117
<i>41 are you washed 'm the
'mood oi the lamb'?</i>

7
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:45,498
J1 have you been to Jesus
for the cleansing power?

8
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:51,254
<i>41 are you washed 'm the
'mood oi the lamb'?</i>

9
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:57,051
J1 are you fully trusting
in his grace this hour?

10
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:02,724
<i>41 are you washed 'm the
'mood oi the lamb'?</i>

11
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:08,605
J1 are you washed in the blood

12
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:14,569
j1 in the soul-cleansing
blood of the lamb?

13
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,282
J1 are your garments spotless?

14
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,368
J1 are they white as snow?

15
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:26,665
<i>41 are you washed 'm the
'mood oi the lamb'?</i>

16
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:33,213
J1 are you walking daily
by the savior's side?

17
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,927
<i>41 are you washed 'm the
'mood oi the lamb'?</i>

18
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:44,682
J1 do you rest each
moment in the crucified?

19
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:50,355
<i>41 are you washed 'm the
'mood oi the lamb'?</i>

20
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:56,319
J1 are you washed in the blood

21
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:02,242
j1 in the soul-cleansing
blood of the lamb?

22
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,955
J1 are your garments spotless?

23
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:10,250
J1 are they white as snow?

24
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:17,715
- Wind.

25
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,509
Wind!

26
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,762
- Regina!

27
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,016
Spells can't keep us out.

28
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,394
The spells can't keep us out.

29
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:36,609
- George!

30
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,027
George, help me!

31
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,742
Oh, thank god it's you.

32
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,243
My spells can't keep them out now.

33
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:47,787
They're getting stronger.

34
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:52,959
Did you bring the daggers
and the diary?

35
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:00,841
George?

36
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:10,769
Stop it.

37
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,853
Please, stop it, George.

38
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:14,063
Oh!

39
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,335
Please, stop it, George.

40
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:44,677
No!

41
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,053
No!

42
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:58,983
Remember?

43
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,944
If the crystal breaks it's
the end of both of us.

44
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:08,993
- And now, my pig, you die!

45
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,580
- No.

46
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:13,664
No!

47
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,000
Stop!

48
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,250
Please!

49
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,797
- I can't stand this anymore.

50
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,465
Cory, would you talk to me?

51
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,758
- About what?

52
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,260
- About anything, about
what you're thinking.

53
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,762
- I'm just thinking about driving.

54
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,017
- How much farther is
your grandparents' farm?

55
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:16,394
- I don't know.

56
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,022
I think not far.

57
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,233
- Cory, what was
your dad like?

58
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:37,915
<i>- Cow-</i>

59
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:41,627
- dad.

60
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,256
- Well, what was
it like when you saw him?

61
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,092
- He was just an old drunk.

62
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,051
Stranger.

63
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,182
- You know, it's funny.

64
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:56,142
- What is?

65
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,769
- I really wanted you to
find your dad.

66
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,272
I thought it would help
you undo the knot you have

67
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,440
yourself tied in.

68
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,442
Now I'm sorry you ever
laid eyes on him.

69
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:05,860
- What's that supposed to mean?

70
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,112
- It means that in the past 48
hours you've not looked to me

71
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,947
in the face once.

72
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,032
In fact, since you found your
father, you've completely

73
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,493
and totally cut me out of your life

74
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,662
and I'd just like to know why.

75
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,289
- I brought you with me.

76
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:19,749
- Yeah.

77
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:20,958
But for what?

78
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,085
You've not even spoken
10 words with me

79
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,088
since we started up
here this morning.

80
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,416
So?

81
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,963
- It's just that since...

82
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:53,425
It's since I saw my old
man there's uh...

83
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,554
It's been this voice inside
my head like a loud speaker

84
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,348
telling me to get to that farm.

85
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:19,785
I've been here before.

86
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,620
- What?

87
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:21,829
- In a dream.

88
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,082
- Welcome home, Cory.

89
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,023
<i>- Cow-</i>

90
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,316
Cory, are you all right?

91
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,734
- Yeah.

92
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,444
Yeah, I'm okay.

93
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:36,737
- You just seemed
to go somewhere else.

94
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,281
- Well, I'm fine now, really.

95
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,451
- How are you, folks?

96
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,328
What can I do for you?

97
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,330
- How do we get to the
Carter place from here?

98
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:29,415
- You can't.

99
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,417
There's no such place.

100
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,878
- This map says it's
right near here.

101
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:35,671
- That map is wrong.

102
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,926
Now, unless you want some gas,
why don't you just move on?!

103
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:01,489
- Cory, maybe he's right.

104
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,865
The map could be wrong.

105
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,658
Let's just go home.

106
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:05,618
- No.

107
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,291
This is the place of the dream.

108
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:16,003
The farm is near, I can feel it.

109
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,120
Hello!

110
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:55,459
Anybody here?

111
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:01,799
Hello!

112
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:19,858
- Hey, harman!

113
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:31,370
- A moon for the misbegotten.

114
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,788
- Oh, please!

115
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,249
Cory, I just want you to lighten up.

116
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,215
- Bathroom's out back.

117
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,674
- Oh, no, I wasn't--

118
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,509
- can we get something to drink?

119
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:58,438
- We have beer, coke,
water and goat's milk.

120
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,525
- Coke, please.

121
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:01,483
- Same.

122
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,408
Thank you.

123
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,326
Has anyone else been in here today?

124
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,371
- Old man deavers a week ago.

125
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,540
And Mrs. Wilson came by with
the little Linda last week.

126
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,876
Are you little Linda's friends?

127
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,046
Did you meet her when
she went away to school?

128
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,799
I don't think little Linda
really went away to school.

129
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,094
I think maybe little
Linda got into trouble

130
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,138
and they sent her away.

131
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,349
Did you meet little Linda at school?

132
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,643
- No, we don't know little Linda.

133
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,520
Uh, can you tell us how far
the Carter farm is from here?

134
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,030
- I've never heard of it.

135
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,455
- That's got to be Dell's Jeep.

136
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:57,289
- Good.

137
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,999
I wanna get moving.

138
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,090
- Elaine.

139
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:08,134
- Hi, Dell.

140
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,262
Dell!

141
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:17,309
- Well, now, don't you
look good enough to eat?

142
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,518
Cow, my man!

143
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:22,523
" Ow!

144
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:23,566
Hi, Dell.

145
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,734
How was the drive?

146
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:25,567
- Sucked!

147
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,737
But you know how women are:
We passed that last mall,

148
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,529
Terri panicked, and we had to stop.

149
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,866
- I just got to get some
outdoor clothes.

150
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,494
- And you, you do look
good enough to eat.

151
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,670
That is why I keep her around.

152
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,756
- Bonnie, babe!
- Hi!

153
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:48,673
- How are you?

154
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,092
- I'm fine.

155
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,135
- You look
simply marvelous.

156
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:53,012
- Oh, and you look
absolutely divine.

157
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:53,971
- Oh, thank you, thank you.

158
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:01,020
- Bizarre greeting
rituals of the subculture.

159
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,027
Good afternoon, Mr. harman.

160
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,696
- Jack, man, I'm glad to see you.

161
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,781
- Well, your message sounded urgent.

162
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,449
So, here we are.

163
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:15,701
- Thanks for coming.

164
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:16,785
I mean that.

165
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:17,869
- I know.

166
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,206
- Well if you two homos can keep
your hands out of each other

167
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,166
for a second, let's
get something to drink.

168
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,251
- Maybe Cory can tell us why
we are here in the sticks.

169
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,471
- Anybody want a beer?

170
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:36,972
- No, thanks.

171
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,140
- No, we're fine.

172
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,224
- I'm fine.

173
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,726
- What is it, just a no week?

174
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,561
- Not for me.

175
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,479
- That's why I keep her around.

176
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,531
- His thing is about this big.

177
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,159
- What's so funny?

178
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:58,952
What is it?!

179
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:00,371
- Nothing, Dell.

180
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:01,747
- No, what is it?

181
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,999
- It's just a little thing,
Dell, it's not worth mentioning.

182
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,625
- You're right.

183
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,419
- So, Cory, uh...

184
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,087
Why did you bring us up here?

185
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:10,381
- I found my father.

186
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:11,590
- Is he okay?

187
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:13,884
- No, uh...

188
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:17,847
He slit his wrists the
day after I saw him.

189
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,849
- You didn't tell me that.

190
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:21,766
- I know.

191
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,062
I just couldn't.

192
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:28,566
Four days after he was born, uh...

193
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,736
His family disappeared
from a farm near here.

194
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,238
- Where was you dad when
that happened?

195
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:36,448
- He was in an
Incubator in a hospital

196
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,576
and if he hadn't of been there he'd
of been gone too.

197
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,411
- Did anyone ever find his family?

198
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,498
- No, but right after I was
born, he came up here

199
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,458
to find out what happened.

200
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:48,460
And he never came home.

201
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,462
I think something bizarre has
been going on at that farm

202
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,922
for a long time.

203
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,884
I'm gonna find out what.

204
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,177
I need your help.

205
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,137
- Count me in.

206
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:01,223
- Me too.

207
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,703
- Let me give you some advice, son.

208
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:26,165
Take your friends and go home now.

209
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,125
- We've got business at that farm.

210
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,002
It belongs to me now.

211
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,796
- You do not own that property.

212
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:33,839
- Oh, yeah?

213
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,509
Then who's the owner
of that land, old man?

214
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:38,552
You, maybe?

215
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:48,062
- The dead.

216
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,608
- You know, you not only
got an attitude problem,

217
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,818
you're also out of your fucking mind!

218
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:58,530
- You got to learn to
respect the elders, boy,

219
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,657
before one of them hurts you.

220
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,118
- Now just hold on a minute here,
Mr.

221
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,120
We don't want any trouble.

222
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:05,954
Do we, Dell?

223
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,497
- No, no, no, no, no, no trouble.

224
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:11,543
- Then all of you, get in them cars

225
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,461
and go back where you came from.

226
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,975
- What is it, harcourt?

227
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,102
What are you trying to hide?

228
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:33,023
- I saw what happened
to the Carter family.

229
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,233
It was the drought of 29.

230
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,070
A hot dry wind blew that summer.

231
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,658
The cattle and the crops
were burning to a crisp.

232
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,204
The smell of death hung in the air.

233
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,540
It happened on a Sunday.

234
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:56,213
All the families were in
church, except the Carters.

235
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,508
And they never missed church,

236
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:04,805
so that evening I went up to
see if they were all right.

237
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:10,269
And...God help me, I saw them...

238
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:12,479
I saw--

239
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,189
- saw what, what did you see?

240
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,191
- Blood everywhere!

241
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,401
Black blood on the walls!

242
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:23,698
Figures in the dark,
laughing, coming at me.

243
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:26,076
And I screamed, then I ran.

244
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,290
And I never told a soul.

245
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,172
Til now.

246
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,020
Hell, it ain't even loaded.

247
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:57,274
Please, boy, don't go up there.

248
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,192
- I have to.

249
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:01,653
- I know.

250
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:05,449
Well, you just follow
that road to...

251
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,575
Till it ends.

252
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:09,786
- Thanks.

253
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,792
It's alright.

254
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,168
It's alright.

255
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,930
- Good afternoon, ladies
and gentlemen.

256
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:32,101
Welcome to the wonderful
world of magic.

257
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,478
Today we will take you to the
land of illusion and fantasy,

258
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:37,981
where the common place is fantastic

259
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,942
and the fantastic is common place.

260
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,529
- I didn't know your former
boy was gonna be here.

261
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:45,656
- Well, neither did I.

262
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,306
- A Princess should
always have flowers.

263
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:38,375
- Skinny little chicken shit!

264
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,335
I'll shove that karate
crap up your ass!

265
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,087
- Be my guest.

266
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,423
- Gentlemen, easy now.

267
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,260
Easy now, don't hurt the rabbit.

268
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:57,394
- Dell, Dell, Dell, Dell, cool out.

269
00:23:58,479 --> 00:23:59,855
I asked these guys to
come and help me, okay?

270
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:01,440
This I don't need.

271
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:02,607
- I have to agree with him.

272
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,318
We don't need the fist
of fury demonstration,

273
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:05,569
you know what I mean?

274
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:06,528
Hi, Cory.

275
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,029
- Hi, Stacy.

276
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:09,948
I didn't think you guys
were gonna make it.

277
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:10,782
- What?

278
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,910
And miss the chance to
play a grand resrot like this?

279
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,828
To bring magic and wonder
to the hinder lands?

280
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,832
The hangout with the
beautiful people?

281
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:22,169
My man, there just isn't
any other place to be.

282
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,673
Besides, you needed us to be here,
so...

283
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,175
Voilé.

284
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,177
Here we are.

285
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:31,011
- Glad to have you.

286
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:32,054
- So, uh...

287
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:35,182
What exactly is the nature
of this little expedition,

288
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:36,350
if I may ask?

289
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:39,228
- Follow me up the road
aways and I'll show you.

290
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,895
Dell, are you still coming?

291
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,940
- Yeah, yeah, we're in.

292
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:45,192
- What about you?

293
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:46,068
- I don't know why or where,

294
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,195
but I wouldn't miss it for anything.

295
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:50,197
- All right, let's get going.

296
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:03,502
- Next time, you little faggot,
I'll drop you like a bad habit.

297
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,050
- Shazam!

298
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,438
- Son of a bitchin' idiots!

299
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,697
- Still onboard?

300
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,199
- All the way, captain.

301
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:38,912
- You're making a bad mistake, boy.

302
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:42,415
- Maybe so, but it's mine to make.

303
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:18,201
- Damned fools!

304
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,755
- What are you going to
expect to find up here?

305
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,719
- I need to have some
answers about who I am.

306
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:22,825
- Jeez!

307
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,764
What do you think happened here?

308
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,935
- I wonder who it is?

309
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,897
- Stay away from it!

310
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:54,107
Don't touch it!

311
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,066
Please.

312
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:48,662
- What is it, Bonnie?

313
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:49,496
What's wrong?

314
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,497
- That!

315
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,251
- It's my dad's older brother.

316
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,629
- How do you know that?

317
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,005
- I just know, that's all.

318
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,468
- Here's the answer to
the mystery right here.

319
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:47,929
Somebody, somebody
arranged one or two here,

320
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,348
tortured whoever is in that
cross and set fire the house.

321
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,227
They must have died in the fire.

322
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,158
- I don't know what happened
here, but you can sure tell

323
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:11,369
death walked through this place.

324
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:51,868
- Cory?

325
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:55,872
Cow-

326
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,500
cow-

327
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:10,553
- I'm going inside.

328
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:11,762
- Cory, wait.

329
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,724
There's something really wrong here.

330
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,434
I think we should go.

331
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:17,935
- Bonnie's right, Cory,
i feel it too.

332
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,521
Don't go in there.

333
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:21,231
- I have to see what's
through that door.

334
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:23,066
You guys can wait out here.

335
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,275
- Hey, catch.

336
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:24,707
- "To Regina, with all my love."

337
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,729
It's my grandmother.

338
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,317
- "Nunc protestas, satane vivet."

339
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:04,394
- Get out!

340
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:05,353
Get out!

341
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:17,740
- Cory!

342
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,004
- What the hell is going on here,
harman?!

343
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:33,131
- I don't know, I don't know!

344
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:34,382
But what was that Bonnie read?!

345
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:35,216
What did it say?!

346
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,135
- It was Latin, it says,
"now Satan shall walk."

347
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,388
- This baby will do the
trick against whatever moves.

348
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:41,931
- I don't care what it is,
i say we get out of here now

349
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,099
before the sun goes down.

350
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:44,016
- Do what you want.

351
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:45,226
Whatever is here killed
my grandparents.

352
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,353
I wanna find out why.

353
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:56,571
- Let's get the hell out of here,
come on!

354
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,459
- My battery is dead.

355
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:10,835
- So it's mine.

356
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,048
- We have to get out of here now!

357
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:16,883
- She's right.

358
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:18,343
This place is possessed.

359
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:19,719
- Be serious.

360
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:22,722
I tell you, what we witnessed
here is hallucination.

361
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:24,849
- Come on, Jack, what happened
in that house was real.

362
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,058
Saw it with your own eyes.

363
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:27,602
- Well, then I don't
believe my own eyes.

364
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:30,021
Things like this simply
don't happen.

365
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:33,066
- Jack, there is something
here, something evil.

366
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:33,942
- Evil?

367
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:34,775
Evil, where?

368
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,194
- There.

369
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,530
It's been waiting all this time.

370
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:40,031
- Waiting for what?

371
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,658
- For us, for us to come here.

372
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:44,535
Promise me something.

373
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:45,828
- Anything-

374
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,997
- if we die, don't bury me here.

375
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:50,917
- You're not going to die,
Bonnie.

376
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:51,918
- Promise me.

377
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:54,295
- Okay, I promise, but
nothing is going to happen.

378
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:55,838
I won't let it.

379
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:57,632
- Let's get her out of here.

380
00:36:57,966 --> 00:36:58,967
- Okay, let's grab what we can carry

381
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,592
and walk back to the station.

382
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,555
- Man, look how fast that fog is
rolling in.

383
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,619
- I think we're in trouble.

384
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:10,746
- I think you're right.

385
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:13,457
- I've never seen a fog like this.

386
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,251
- It's not the same forest.

387
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:16,335
- Of course it is.

388
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,170
- Yeah, an I'm the pope.

389
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:22,008
The same power that was in
that house is doing this.

390
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:23,551
- Look, it's coming back!

391
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,691
Where the hell are we now?!

392
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,276
- God, it's cold!

393
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,570
- Oh, no, here it comes again!

394
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:02,006
Oh, god!

395
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:05,801
- Oh, no!

396
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:07,970
- Son of a bitch!

397
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:20,733
- Dell, stop!

398
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:30,159
- Hey, where do you
come from, little girl?

399
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,207
- Dell, are you all right?

400
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:39,418
- You can't leave.

401
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,170
- No!

402
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:45,841
- You are mine.

403
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:02,608
- You...

404
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:04,401
Lied.

405
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:17,206
- Now what do we do, harman?!

406
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,333
- Well, whatever is here
isn't gonna let us go.

407
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:20,417
- Then no shit, Sherlock!

408
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,044
Do you have any other
hot news for us?!

409
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,712
- Yeah, the sun is gonna
be down in a few minutes.

410
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:26,758
We got two choices: The cars
or the house for the night.

411
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:27,966
I think we'll be safer in the house.

412
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:30,469
- But something in there
just tried to kill us!

413
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:31,261
- I don't think so.

414
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,889
I think whatever it is is
only trying to warn us away.

415
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,057
- And how the
hell do you know that?!

416
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:36,433
- I don't!

417
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:37,435
It's just a feeling I have.

418
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,520
- Well, that's just great, pal,
it's because of your feelings

419
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,939
what got us into this shit
hole in the first place!

420
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,108
- I'm going back inside.

421
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:59,707
- Well, I'm not sleeping out
here with you and no buick.

422
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:01,959
- Lead on, mcduff.

423
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:04,003
- You're crazy.

424
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:05,212
All of you, you're all crazy!

425
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:15,973
- We have to talk.

426
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,309
- Chuck, there's nothing
left for us to talk about.

427
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:19,769
- Come on, Terri, i
can see it in your eyes

428
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:20,603
back at the cafe.

429
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:21,979
- Chuck, you're mistaken,
I'm Dell's now.

430
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,647
I'm gonna stay with him.

431
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,441
- Terri, I love you.

432
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:28,945
- Chuck, it's too late for that.

433
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:30,654
Dell needs me.

434
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:32,115
You don't.

435
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:33,657
Life is just a game to you.

436
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:34,492
It's not to me.

437
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,577
I need somebody who's
serious about me.

438
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:37,620
Dell is.

439
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:52,093
- We could fight if you want to.

440
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,971
But we don't have anything
to fight about.

441
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,686
- Well, let's go inside then.

442
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:03,813
- Good idea.

443
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:01,787
- I think it's gonna be okay.

444
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,582
Let's clean up.

445
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:45,122
- Cory.

446
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,128
- Grandmother?

447
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:17,173
"Being the diary of Regina Carter,

448
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:18,965
"born June 8th 1889.

449
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:40,362
"L conjure thee, oh delos,
protect this my child

450
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:42,907
"from the evil touch.

451
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,534
"Rise now and approach me."

452
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:52,458
Christ!

453
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:53,834
Are you trying to give me
a heart attack?!

454
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,836
- I could ask you the same thing.

455
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:57,546
Oh, god!

456
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:00,674
I made you some food.

457
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:09,391
- Some weekend, huh?

458
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:10,767
- Yeah.

459
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:12,603
Really know how to show
a girl a good time.

460
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:16,357
- I know it may not seem like
it, but I'm glad you're here.

461
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:18,943
- Oh, I'm glad to hear you say it.

462
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:20,486
- I found my grandmother's diary.

463
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:21,445
<i>~</i> oh!

464
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,004
- "It is dusk.

465
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:41,048
"L know tonight I will die.

466
00:46:42,008 --> 00:46:45,302
"Even the spells grandmother
taught me can't save us now."

467
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:46,136
<i>'</i> Spells?

468
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,095
- Yeah.

469
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:50,891
"L know that someday you
might come to face the evil

470
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,851
"that comes for me.

471
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,311
"In the bottom drawer of the vanity

472
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:55,812
"you will find two daggers

473
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:58,566
"which are part of the
sacred set of seven.

00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,317
"The other five have been lost.

475
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:01,860
"It is written that with all seven

476
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:03,820
"you can kill the son of Satan.

477
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,115
"I pray these two might help you."

478
00:47:58,209 --> 00:47:59,543
I found something.

479
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,754
This farm was built by
my great-grandfather.

480
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,216
He and a group of settlers
followed a preacher named Anders

481
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,592
to this valley.

482
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:11,055
But when they arrived,
Anders began preaching

483
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:13,974
about the false god of the Bible...

484
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,310
And the true god he had found here.

485
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:17,978
- He was a Satan worshiper?

486
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,105
- Yeah.

487
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:24,151
Trying to raise the devil.

488
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:27,696
Then three little girls disappeared.

489
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,865
The searchers found them...

490
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:33,160
What was left of them in an
altar behind Anders' place.

491
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:36,538
- He was a real sick pup.

492
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:39,374
- There was a big fight.

493
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:41,543
Anders and all of his
followers were burned to death

494
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,086
in his house.

495
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:44,797
- That sounds fair.

496
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:48,759
- I hope they cooked slow.

497
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:52,221
- After that, everything was
okay until the summer of 1929.

498
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,391
That was the year my
father was born.

499
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:58,226
"June 8th.

500
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,980
"Mrs. James just had triplets.

501
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:04,274
"They were killed right
after the birth.

502
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:06,986
"None of the babies was even human."

503
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:08,820
- All the children were the same.

504
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,365
Except for Cory's dad.

505
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:13,283
- What was so special about him?

506
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:16,370
- I have no idea.

507
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:19,415
But the last entry reads,

508
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,628
"everyone is dead
except George and I.

509
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,254
"It's all hopeless.

510
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:28,549
"L can hear them rising
out in the barn.

511
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:29,758
"It's the..."

512
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:34,512
And that's what
happened to my family.

513
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:36,723
- Now we're in the
middle of all this.

514
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,747
- Will the meat puppets from
hell show tonight?

515
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:03,333
- My son, if they do,
we'll just have to go out

516
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,877
and kick some supernatural ass.

517
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:07,379
- Charles, my man.

518
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:09,214
I like your attitude.

519
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:10,840
Very American, very...

520
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:12,509
John Wayne.

521
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,678
- Very what choice do we have?

522
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:16,638
- It's a good point.

523
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:20,141
- Man, I just wish we had some
hand grenades or something.

524
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:22,603
- I'd rather have a
tahitian vacation.

525
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:24,896
- Not Tahiti.

526
00:50:25,231 --> 00:50:25,940
- Why not?

527
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,525
- Voodoo, man, they do
voodoo in Tahiti.

528
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:30,735
- Let's say Chicago.

529
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:34,239
- Vegas.

530
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:36,700
We know nothing spiritual lives
in Vegas.

531
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,076
- Good point.

532
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,285
Vegas, it is.

00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:41,329

00:50:56,637 --> 00:50:58,680
Come out and play with me.

539
00:51:03,936 --> 00:51:04,686
Chuck!

540
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:07,105
Stacy!

541
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:10,275
Come out.

542
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:13,486
- Demon.

543
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,324
- Stacy!

544
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:24,164
- Hey, Cory, guess what we just saw!

545
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:25,499
Cory?

546
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:26,625
Hey, harman.

547
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,545
Hey, Jack, wake up!

548
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,465
- I guess it only wants us.

549
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,843
- Here I am.

550
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:39,513
- Let's go.

551
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:45,894
- Why not?

552
00:52:19,345 --> 00:52:21,764
They're playing our song.

553
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:22,889
- Alright.

554
00:52:24,016 --> 00:52:24,933
Let's dance.

555
00:52:58,592 --> 00:52:59,509
- Over here.

556
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:04,223
I have something for you.

557
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:18,111
Surprise!

558
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,949
- Eat this!

559
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:27,245
Oh, man, I think we're in trouble.

560
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:29,372
- I think you're right.

561
00:54:13,709 --> 00:54:15,168
I think we might just
get out of this.

562
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:16,544
- You doubt it?

563
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:23,844
Hey, Chuck.

564
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:25,304
- What, maestro?

565
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,099
- Presto.

566
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:31,935
Eh.

567
00:55:22,528 --> 00:55:23,695
- I made it.

568
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:24,779
I made it!

569
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:25,738
Fuck yqu!

570
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:28,908
- Surprise!

571
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:32,203
- What happened?

572
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:33,413
What was that?!

573
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:34,456
- It came from outside.

574
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:36,458
- Where are Chuck and Stacy?!

575
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:40,086
- Stacy!

576
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:42,422
Chuck!

577
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:49,387
Oh, no!

578
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:50,304
<i>'</i> My god!

579
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:52,640
Oh, no!

580
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:54,684
No!

581
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:56,352
No!

582
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:11,201
- Terri, look, we got
to keep our act together,

583
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:13,078
and we're gonna get out of this alive.

584
00:56:13,412 --> 00:56:14,204
- Didn't you see the blood?

585
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:17,415
- Hey, trust me, I'll
get us out of this, okay?

586
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:19,542
- Okay-

587
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,839
- Dell, we're gonna
check the backroom.

588
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:25,798
- Yeah.

589
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:40,939
- Why didn't you tell the
others about the daggers

590
00:56:41,273 --> 00:56:42,565
and the spells in the diary?

591
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:43,942
- Tell them what?

592
00:56:44,276 --> 00:56:46,027
That my grandmother was a witch?

593
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:49,030
She used spells to protect
her son and this house?

594
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,159
Dell's half crazy and
Jack's a basket case.

595
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:54,952
One more thing and
either of them could lose it.

596
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:57,747
- Maybe those spells could help us.

597
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:00,792
- They didn't helped her much,
did they?

598
00:57:14,473 --> 00:57:15,765
Keep this with you.

599
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:17,809
It may be some protection.

600
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:20,812
- You don't think we can beat it,
do you?

601
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:23,774
- I'm sorry I got you into this.

602
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:27,235
- Don't even think that,
Cory, I got me into this.

603
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:29,696
I'm here because I love you.

604
00:57:31,323 --> 00:57:33,033
- How did I get so lucky.

605
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:34,784
- Magic.

606
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,047
- Honey, you're alright,
it was only a dream.

607
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:30,924
You're alright now.

608
00:58:32,384 --> 00:58:33,426
- It's not big deal, Dell.

609
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:36,805
- God, I wish I was home right now.

610
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:37,639
- Quiet!

611
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:40,975
That's a car!

612
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:48,733
- It's Willy and reena!

613
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:53,321
- Don't shut it off.

614
00:58:54,156 --> 00:58:55,282
Don't shut it off!

615
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:57,325
Don't shut it off!

616
00:58:58,785 --> 00:58:59,869
Don't shut it off!

617
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:01,370
Don't shut it off!

618
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:03,539
Don't shut it off!

619
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:04,791
Don't shut it off!

620
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:09,587
- What did you say?

621
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:13,508
- I said, "don't shut it off."

622
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:14,467
- Why not?

623
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:23,392
- But what we did wrong?

624
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:25,979
We just got here.

625
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:42,245
- Get back inside.

626
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:04,726
- Hey, cow-

627
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:09,731
look, pal, Terri and I aren't
gonna spend another night

628
01:00:10,065 --> 01:00:11,232
in this damned house.

629
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:12,692
Now we're going through
that front door

630
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:14,318
and we're going for help.

631
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:17,071
- Dell, are you sure you
wanna do that?

632
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:19,573
- Yeah, I'm sure, sure
as I'm about anything.

633
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:25,789
Are you positive
you wanna come with me?

634
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:29,793
- Like I told you before,
honey, wherever you go, I go.

635
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:32,962
- That's why I keep her with me.

636
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,012
- You may need this.

637
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:44,015
- Thanks, Cory.

638
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:46,434
Let's get out of here.

639
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:06,662
- I don't think they're
gonna make it.

640
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,165
- I don't think so, either.

641
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,126
Better get back to work.

642
01:01:26,725 --> 01:01:27,559
Jack.

643
01:01:27,893 --> 01:01:28,393
- Yeah.

644
01:01:28,727 --> 01:01:29,227
- I'll be back in a minute.

645
01:01:29,561 --> 01:01:30,353
- Alright.

646
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:57,213
- Grandmother?

647
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:03,636
Grandmother?

648
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,352
Is it you in the house, isn't it?

649
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:24,782
Grandmother?

650
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:29,079
What are the demons afraid of?

651
01:02:30,038 --> 01:02:30,913
Grandmother?

652
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:35,459
Grandmother?

653
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:36,920
- Cow-

654
01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:42,091
- this house is as secure
as it can get.

655
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:43,926
- So what do we do now?

656
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:45,095
- I guess we wait.

657
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:45,970
- N-

658
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:47,096
- what do you mean?

659
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:49,265
- Well, I say we attack it.

660
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:53,019
Now, Bonnie mentioned she
felt something from the barn.

661
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:53,978
- Jack's right.

662
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:55,730
My grandmother mentioned the barn.

663
01:02:56,064 --> 01:02:57,982
Maybe there's a door with
the leads into the barn.

664
01:02:58,316 --> 01:02:59,734
The same way that leads
into this house.

665
01:03:00,068 --> 01:03:02,195
- And if that's the
center of this force,

666
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:05,240
we got to find some way
to destroy it.

667
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:06,699
- Now you're talking.

668
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:08,117
How about you, guys?

669
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:10,870
- Sure that beats waiting.

670
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:12,497
- I don't wanna go, but
if we have to,

671
01:03:12,831 --> 01:03:13,748
let's get it over with.

672
01:03:14,082 --> 01:03:15,041
- I'll get the flashlights.

673
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:16,417
- I'll get the shotgun.

674
01:03:29,264 --> 01:03:30,014
- Oh, no!

675
01:03:31,099 --> 01:03:31,849
- Shit!

676
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:46,363
Terri?

677
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:48,407
Terri!

678
01:03:49,868 --> 01:03:52,370
Terri, where the hell are you?!

679
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:59,293
- Can't you hear it?

680
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:00,419
- Hear what?

681
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:02,546
- Death!

682
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:20,356
- But I loved you.

683
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,653
- I loved you too.

684
01:04:53,765 --> 01:04:54,807
- What was that?

685
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:57,184
- It wasn't human, that's for sure.

686
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:00,479
- Look.

687
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:09,780
- Come on.

688
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:10,359
- What is that?

689
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:18,033
- It's an altar to the devil.

690
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:20,161
- God, it's horrible.

691
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:24,748
- But there's something
kind of beautiful about it.

692
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:33,007
No, it really is beautiful.

693
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:44,727
Help, get it off me!

694
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:51,942
Help me!

695
01:07:52,277 --> 01:07:52,902
Help me!

696
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:12,755
- Run, Willy!

697
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:26,352
- It's just us.

698
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:28,145
The gruesome twosome

699
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:33,192
- Dell looked enough to eat.

700
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:41,450
- But you're dead.

701
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:43,911
- You can't kill what's
already dead.

702
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:55,298
- Stay right there or I'll
have to blow you in two.

703
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:56,883
- That thing won't work in here.

704
01:08:57,216 --> 01:08:59,676
This is the house of the damned.

705
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:10,688
- Cory!

706
01:09:11,022 --> 01:09:11,605
Help me!

707
01:09:16,027 --> 01:09:16,652
- Leave!

708
01:09:18,905 --> 01:09:20,239
Oh, you don't like this, huh?

709
01:09:38,341 --> 01:09:40,176
- God, where's Willy?

710
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:41,177
- He must still be in the barn!

711
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:42,136
- Shit!

712
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:45,055
- Forgot something?

713
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:46,474
- Ah!

714
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:49,727
- Isn't he cute?

715
01:09:53,064 --> 01:09:54,899
- Cory, don't use the dagger!

716
01:10:11,499 --> 01:10:12,875
- You killed me.

717
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,933
- You all will scream in
the hell tonight!

718
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:31,477
- All of you, ha!

719
01:10:57,712 --> 01:10:58,629
- Get ready!

720
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,822
Now what's happening, harman?

721
01:11:25,156 --> 01:11:26,448
- Don't you see?!

722
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:27,283
Ha!

723
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:29,368
Grandmother's old spell still works!

724
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:30,577
They can't reach us!

725
01:11:30,912 --> 01:11:31,621
- Are you sure?

726
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:32,746
- Yeah!

727
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:35,833
Eat it, scumbags!

728
01:11:36,167 --> 01:11:37,459
- Come and get us!

729
01:12:20,127 --> 01:12:22,212
- Cory, now what happened?

730
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:23,672
- Shit!

731
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:26,174
The demons must have
broken the spell!

732
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:31,430
- Here, take this.

733
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:33,682
I'm gonna check the back rooms.

734
01:12:34,392 --> 01:12:35,351
- Jack.

735
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:36,644
- Yeah?

736
01:12:36,978 --> 01:12:37,979
- Watch yourself.

737
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:39,563
- Good luck to you too.

738
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:24,941
- So friend, we meet again.

739
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:05,149
- Where did they go?

740
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:07,317
- I don't know.

741
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:10,695
Maybe they're still
afraid of the house.

742
01:14:25,753 --> 01:14:26,962
- Jack!

743
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:29,298
Jack, I'm coming for you!

744
01:14:59,662 --> 01:15:00,120
- Get back!

745
01:15:00,454 --> 01:15:00,954
- No!

746
01:15:01,288 --> 01:15:01,788
No!

747
01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:02,832
Let me out!

748
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:35,030
Jack!

749
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:37,366
Jack, it's Bonnie.

750
01:15:38,325 --> 01:15:39,576
Please, help me.

751
01:15:40,828 --> 01:15:41,578
- Bonnie?

752
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:43,914
Bonnie!

753
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:44,873
- Help me!

754
01:15:46,834 --> 01:15:47,584
- Bonnie?

755
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:50,963
- Please, help me, Jack!

756
01:15:51,297 --> 01:15:51,922
Jack!

757
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:54,467
Please, Jack!

758
01:15:56,052 --> 01:15:57,511
- Bonnie!

759
01:15:57,845 --> 01:15:58,470
- Help me!

760
01:16:00,931 --> 01:16:01,681
Jack!

761
01:16:03,601 --> 01:16:04,351
Jack!

762
01:16:08,147 --> 01:16:08,772
<i>'</i> God!

763
01:16:14,695 --> 01:16:16,488
This can't be happening.

764
01:16:31,879 --> 01:16:34,047
- Check Stacy's bag for more ammo.

765
01:16:45,142 --> 01:16:45,767
Hurry!

766
01:17:04,703 --> 01:17:06,079
- There's no way we can
keep them out!

767
01:17:06,413 --> 01:17:08,415
- Take the diary and
tell Jack to get in here.

768
01:17:32,231 --> 01:17:32,981
- Jack?

769
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:52,292
- Elaine.

770
01:17:54,879 --> 01:17:55,796
It's Jackie.

771
01:17:58,048 --> 01:17:59,632
- Oh, no, Jack!

772
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:00,592
Not you.

773
01:18:01,802 --> 01:18:03,220
- It doesn't hurt.

774
01:18:05,764 --> 01:18:07,849
- Jack, we can fight this.

775
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:09,643
- Don't fight.

776
01:18:09,977 --> 01:18:11,603
I'll make it so sweet.

777
01:18:19,987 --> 01:18:22,864
You'll give the father
much pleasure.

778
01:18:31,081 --> 01:18:32,332
- Goodbye, Jack.

779
01:19:09,995 --> 01:19:10,787
- You alright?

780
01:19:11,121 --> 01:19:12,413
- It's Jack.

781
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:17,043
He turned into one of those
things, I used the last dagger.

782
01:19:17,378 --> 01:19:18,879
I saw his soul.

783
01:19:19,213 --> 01:19:19,713
- It's okay.

784
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:20,964
You did him a favor.

785
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:22,257
You saved him.

786
01:19:39,483 --> 01:19:40,692
- Ah!

787
01:19:44,363 --> 01:19:45,739
- Kill them.

788
01:19:54,123 --> 01:19:55,666
- I'm sorry.

789
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:56,875
- I'm not.

790
01:20:02,381 --> 01:20:04,424
- I have arrived, my children.

791
01:20:04,758 --> 01:20:05,550
Gather now.

792
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:06,926
Come, my sheep.

793
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:11,723
I am come to take you.

794
01:20:12,725 --> 01:20:14,601
Yes, you, the faithful.

795
01:20:14,935 --> 01:20:16,811
Tonight reap your reward.

796
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:23,735
The wait is finally over.

797
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:24,694
Come now.

798
01:20:25,863 --> 01:20:28,198
Now shall your suffering end.

799
01:20:36,457 --> 01:20:38,041
Our time is at hand.

800
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:52,139
Gather now for the time has come.

801
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:59,604
I bring you greetings from
the shallow father.

802
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,782
Yes, my children, come unto me.

803
01:21:13,911 --> 01:21:17,331
So, my children, at last
have we gathered.

804
01:21:18,957 --> 01:21:23,044
And after all these years
shall we complete the cycle.

805
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:27,633
- Father, take us.

806
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:31,845
- All fought for him.

807
01:21:32,179 --> 01:21:32,888
All love him.

808
01:21:35,349 --> 01:21:39,436
- Tonight shall we open the
door for our beloved father.

809
01:21:42,147 --> 01:21:43,314
Yeah, my flock.

810
01:21:46,193 --> 01:21:47,235
Come.

811
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:48,444
Come unto me.

812
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:04,461
- No!

813
01:22:04,795 --> 01:22:06,004
No!

814
01:22:06,338 --> 01:22:07,797
No, please, help me!

815
01:22:08,799 --> 01:22:09,549
- Bonnie!

816
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:11,217
- Oh, god, help me.

817
01:22:11,552 --> 01:22:12,135
No!

818
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:16,139
- No!

819
01:22:16,473 --> 01:22:16,973
Stop!

820
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:17,932
Bonnie!

821
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:25,774
- No!

822
01:22:27,234 --> 01:22:28,735
- Cory, help her!

823
01:22:34,992 --> 01:22:36,159
- There's nothing we can do for her.

824
01:22:36,493 --> 01:22:37,494
- No!

825
01:22:48,088 --> 01:22:51,800
- Now thou souls, i
come for thee!

826
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:53,551
- The book!

827
01:22:53,886 --> 01:22:54,511
The book!

828
01:22:54,845 --> 01:22:55,804
We've got to try it!

829
01:22:56,138 --> 01:22:57,681
Draw a circle with the
chalk, go!

830
01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:04,938
- Father of darkness,
i, your son, have arrived.

831
01:23:06,231 --> 01:23:10,151
I have waited long for
this night Cory harman.

832
01:23:14,072 --> 01:23:18,159
After all these centuries,
now this world will be mine.

833
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:22,873
This is a hell of a time to
say it, but...

834
01:23:23,207 --> 01:23:24,082
- I love you.

835
01:23:25,792 --> 01:23:27,126
- I love you too.

836
01:23:29,713 --> 01:23:31,005
- Oh thou, white light,

837
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:33,342
oh, spirits of goodness and peace,

838
01:23:33,675 --> 01:23:36,260
oh, earth mother who
watches over us...

839
01:23:38,096 --> 01:23:39,889
We of this humble flesh,
born of thee...

840
01:23:40,766 --> 01:23:41,975
We who breathe thy breath,

841
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:48,440
- if thee find us worthy,
we beg of you,

842
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:50,233
join us now to thee.

843
01:24:06,542 --> 01:24:08,210
- Am I not beautiful?

844
01:24:14,424 --> 01:24:15,758
- Thy will be done.

845
01:24:27,854 --> 01:24:31,941
- So, the old witch, she
possessed the great secrets.

846
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:34,360
- Yes.

847
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:37,280
- They did her no good.

848
01:24:37,614 --> 01:24:39,907
I took her husband and her head.

849
01:24:41,326 --> 01:24:43,119
- And now you're gonna pay for that.

850
01:24:52,045 --> 01:24:55,089
- I will teach you agony
before you die.

851
01:25:14,693 --> 01:25:16,653
You were always so weak.

852
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:28,164
- Please, god!

853
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:32,335
- The power of your god
is nothing, little man.

854
01:25:32,669 --> 01:25:35,129
I am come to rule this world.

855
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:37,132
You are the last of your line.

856
01:25:37,466 --> 01:25:40,760
The death of your soul will ensure
the gift of mine.

857
01:25:42,596 --> 01:25:44,139
Die, child little man.

858
01:26:12,334 --> 01:26:13,335
- Oh, he's coming around.

859
01:26:13,669 --> 01:26:14,461
Thank god, Cory.

860
01:26:14,795 --> 01:26:15,629
I can't find your pulse.

861
01:26:15,962 --> 01:26:17,338
I thought you were...

862
01:26:18,715 --> 01:26:21,718
- Man, you gave us quite
a scare there for a while.

863
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:23,428
You were like somewhere else.

864
01:26:23,762 --> 01:26:25,680
Cory, are you alright?

865
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:27,015
- Yeah.

866
01:26:27,349 --> 01:26:28,808
Just a little woozy.

867
01:26:31,436 --> 01:26:32,478
Where am I?

868
01:26:32,813 --> 01:26:34,022
- We're at your
grandparents' farm, remember?

869
01:26:34,356 --> 01:26:35,565
We drove up here.

870
01:26:41,863 --> 01:26:43,197
- What happened to me?

871
01:26:43,532 --> 01:26:45,825
- We walked in the front
door, looked around

872
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:47,577
and you just went out like a light.

873
01:26:47,911 --> 01:26:48,786
- Man, you hit the floor so hard,

874
01:26:49,121 --> 01:26:51,915
it was like you had
belted by Mike Tyson.

875
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:54,459
- Jack!

876
01:26:54,793 --> 01:26:56,211
Jack, you're alright!

877
01:26:56,545 --> 01:26:57,671
You're all alive!

878
01:26:58,004 --> 01:26:59,338
- Of course we're all alive.

879
01:26:59,673 --> 01:27:01,132
- Just like real life.

880
01:27:01,466 --> 01:27:03,342
- You were just dreaming.

881
01:27:05,554 --> 01:27:06,263
" Qopsi

882
01:27:07,681 --> 01:27:08,390
- surprise!

883
01:27:21,278 --> 01:27:22,028
- Cory!

884
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:24,030
Cory!

885
01:27:26,324 --> 01:27:27,074
Help me!

886
01:27:39,755 --> 01:27:41,465
- And now my pig-

887
01:27:41,798 --> 01:27:44,342
taste the flesh you loved so well.

888
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:48,638
- Cory, I'm sorry.

889
01:27:50,682 --> 01:27:51,516
I love you.

890
01:27:52,476 --> 01:27:53,810
- I love you too.

891
01:28:11,369 --> 01:28:12,620
If she's dead...

892
01:28:16,917 --> 01:28:17,542
Dad?!

893
01:28:18,627 --> 01:28:20,712
- I always loved you, Cory.

894
01:28:21,046 --> 01:28:21,880
- No, dad.

895
01:28:22,214 --> 01:28:22,839
Don't!

896
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:37,395
Stop it!

897
01:28:37,729 --> 01:28:38,354
Stop it!

898
01:28:48,114 --> 01:28:49,198
It won't work.

899
01:28:50,784 --> 01:28:52,535
I'm not afraid of you.

900
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:55,872
You're the one who's terrified.

901
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:02,295
- I fear nothing from you.

902
01:29:03,129 --> 01:29:04,505
- Another lie.

903
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:07,467
You're terrified of us
because we're alive.

904
01:29:07,801 --> 01:29:08,593
We can feel.

905
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:11,429
You're only a shadow.

906
01:29:11,763 --> 01:29:14,849
You hide behind your cheap magic
tricks because you're dead.

907
01:29:16,643 --> 01:29:18,144
God changed you into a snake

908
01:29:18,478 --> 01:29:21,189
and a chicken shit at the same time.

909
01:29:21,523 --> 01:29:23,775
- I don't need magic to
take your soul.

910
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:38,540
And when you die, I will
have your woman.

911
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:43,374
She will make me fine sons, and
how she will beg for death.

912
01:29:57,684 --> 01:29:58,434
<i>- Cow-</i>

913
01:30:01,354 --> 01:30:02,104
cow-

914
01:30:16,536 --> 01:30:17,161
- get the diary.

915
01:30:17,495 --> 01:30:18,954
Read the last spell.

916
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:24,168
Do it now!

917
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:29,090
- We call upon the power of light.

918
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:31,175
Drive this evil in upon itself.

919
01:30:31,509 --> 01:30:33,385
Set it back into the
darkness from where it came.

920
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:35,263
We call on thee god of light.

921
01:30:35,597 --> 01:30:38,600
Burn this abomination. Cleanse it
from thy blessed earth.

922
01:30:38,934 --> 01:30:39,476
- No!

923
01:30:39,809 --> 01:30:40,601
- They will be done.

924
01:30:40,936 --> 01:30:41,937
- No!

925
01:32:17,699 --> 01:32:19,867
- Cory, you're human again.

926
01:32:22,287 --> 01:32:23,705
Is it over?

927
01:32:24,039 --> 01:32:25,331
Is it really over?

928
01:33:38,947 --> 01:33:39,697
Hello?

929
01:33:40,824 --> 01:33:41,574
Hello!

930
01:33:43,159 --> 01:33:44,326
Harriet?

931
01:33:44,661 --> 01:33:47,288
- Elaine, is that you?

932
01:33:47,622 --> 01:33:49,248
Oh, I'm so glad you came.

933
01:33:49,582 --> 01:33:50,082
My uncle, he was--

934
01:33:50,416 --> 01:33:51,750
- I know.

935
01:33:52,085 --> 01:33:53,544
- Elaine, come here.

936
01:33:56,756 --> 01:33:59,508
I have a surprise for you.

937
01:33:59,843 --> 01:34:01,094
- That's okay.

938
01:34:01,427 --> 01:34:03,804
We have a surprise for you too.
