1
00:00:02,598 --> 00:00:04,681
<i>The year is 2048.</i>

2
00:00:04,714 --> 00:00:08,588
<i>Evolving technologies
can no longer be regulated.</i>

3
00:00:08,621 --> 00:00:13,094
<i>Dangerous advancements forever
alter the criminal landscape.</i>

4
00:00:13,127 --> 00:00:15,632
<i>Police are not prepared.</i>

5
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:18,906
<i>Law enforcement combats
this corruption</i>

6
00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:20,908
<i>with a new line of defense.</i>

7
00:00:22,551 --> 00:00:25,118
<i>But not all are created equal.</i>

8
00:00:27,153 --> 00:00:30,058
<i>The idea behind the DRNs
was to be as human as possible.</i>

9
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:33,595
<i>They were based on a program
called Synthetic Soul.</i>

10
00:00:33,628 --> 00:00:34,995
<i>That's one of the crazy ones.</i>

11
00:00:35,036 --> 00:00:36,669
- I'll lead you in?
- Let's go.

12
00:00:36,702 --> 00:00:40,244
<i>Now all cops...
human and manmade together...</i>

13
00:00:40,277 --> 00:00:43,581
<i>take on the battle
to watch over us all.</i>

15
00:01:07,175 --> 00:01:09,348
Charge at capacity.

16
00:02:03,947 --> 00:02:06,019
Hey.

17
00:02:06,052 --> 00:02:07,387
Hey, James.

18
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,224
- Morning, Mr. Navarro.
- How you doing?

19
00:02:12,768 --> 00:02:14,397
Miss Miller.

20
00:02:14,538 --> 00:02:16,240
Oh. James.

21
00:02:16,273 --> 00:02:17,966
Left your key in
the lock again.

22
00:02:17,967 --> 00:02:19,440
Thank you.

23
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:21,443
I swear my memory gets
worse every day.

24
00:02:21,444 --> 00:02:23,300
I told you, I can have
maintenance come in

25
00:02:23,301 --> 00:02:25,433
and switch those out for
bio locks if you'd like.

26
00:02:25,619 --> 00:02:28,790
That's all right, I prefer
the old-fashioned way.

27
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,064
I'm funny, I guess.

28
00:02:30,097 --> 00:02:32,769
No, no, no, I like that.

29
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:37,007
Uh, this came to the
security desk for you.

30
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,971
Oh, thank you.

31
00:02:38,012 --> 00:02:39,909
I got to get back to the desk.

32
00:02:40,447 --> 00:02:41,886
See you.

33
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,039
Hi, can I help you?

34
00:02:56,908 --> 00:02:58,311
What's your name?

35
00:02:58,544 --> 00:03:00,112
James.

36
00:03:03,754 --> 00:03:05,889
Let's go.

37
00:03:47,008 --> 00:03:48,786
<i>You know what I
love best about you?</i>

38
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:49,947
<i>Your punctuality.</i>

39
00:03:49,988 --> 00:03:51,727
<i>What's that supposed to mean?</i>

40
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,559
You're late and the car
smells like olive oil.

41
00:03:54,592 --> 00:03:58,295
Hold this... and this.

42
00:03:59,737 --> 00:04:01,599
What am I doing here?

43
00:04:01,632 --> 00:04:03,399
You're heating my coffee.

44
00:04:05,808 --> 00:04:07,904
Hey!

45
00:04:07,945 --> 00:04:08,945
I like it hot.

46
00:04:08,978 --> 00:04:12,620
It's best between 155
and 175 degrees.

47
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:14,684
Most people prefer it at 175.

48
00:04:14,717 --> 00:04:18,992
You like it at 165,
and that's what it is.

49
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:20,296
You know how I like my coffee?

50
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:22,698
Yes, I, unlike you,
pay attention to details,

51
00:04:22,731 --> 00:04:24,338
like what time it is
and what time

52
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:26,405
you're supposed to pick up
your partner for shift.

53
00:04:26,438 --> 00:04:27,773
Oh, I pay attention to details,

54
00:04:27,806 --> 00:04:30,310
like you just put your
finger in my coffee.

55
00:04:30,343 --> 00:04:32,178
If you'd like, I could
put it somewhere else.

56
00:04:32,211 --> 00:04:33,046
Wa-Wa-Wait, go back.

57
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,880
- To where?
- To when I didn't have a partner

58
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:36,583
and I could drive
to work in peace.

59
00:04:36,616 --> 00:04:39,151
I know you took my advice

60
00:04:39,191 --> 00:04:41,087
and used olive oil
on your leg, John,

61
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,527
and it works.

62
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,527
You're just too stubborn

63
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,274
to say thank you,
but you're welcome.

64
00:04:45,275 --> 00:04:47,116
I ate a salad...
a Greek salad.

65
00:04:47,132 --> 00:04:48,236
At 10:00 a.m.?

66
00:04:48,269 --> 00:04:50,408
Boy, you're some detective.

67
00:04:50,441 --> 00:04:51,543
Finally.
Now you're talking.

68
00:04:51,576 --> 00:04:53,278
<i>13 RAY. Possible 31.</i>

69
00:04:53,311 --> 00:04:54,278
<i>Homicide.</i>

70
00:04:54,311 --> 00:04:57,446
<i>Body discovered
at 4500 Crescent Ave.</i>

71
00:04:57,479 --> 00:04:58,584
That's three blocks away.

72
00:04:58,617 --> 00:05:00,815
All right, let's go to work.

73
00:05:13,093 --> 00:05:15,532
How long you been here?

74
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,331
We just got here.

75
00:05:17,364 --> 00:05:19,130
There were no witnesses
to the shooting.

76
00:05:19,163 --> 00:05:21,770
The incident happened
within the last 20 minutes.

77
00:05:21,804 --> 00:05:23,138
Who found him?

78
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:25,674
These two, and we've
cordoned off the area.

79
00:05:26,307 --> 00:05:27,704
They killed the cameras.

80
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,403
I think I can still access
the archived footage.

81
00:05:36,871 --> 00:05:39,638
John...

82
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:53,279
They went up to the 25th floor.

83
00:05:56,688 --> 00:05:58,616
They shut down the elevator.

84
00:05:58,657 --> 00:06:00,827
Transmit that security
footage to Maldonado,

85
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,859
so we can try and
I.D. these guys.

86
00:06:06,268 --> 00:06:08,803
Officer Harrison,
call for backup

87
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:10,570
and begin evacuation protocols.

88
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:11,866
- Yes, sir.
- And be careful.

89
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:13,803
Perps are still
in the building.

90
00:06:13,836 --> 00:06:15,370
You got it.

91
00:06:23,013 --> 00:06:25,085
What's the plan?

92
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:28,786
I got no idea...

93
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:32,389
but we got 25 floors
to figure it out.

94
00:06:36,201 --> 00:06:38,673
<i>Hand over the phone.</i>

95
00:06:38,706 --> 00:06:40,241
<i>Shut your mouth.</i>

96
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:41,537
<i>Hand it over.</i>

97
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,306
<i>Stop talking.</i>

98
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:45,978
<i>Please don't hurt me.</i>

99
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:48,282
<i>Let me see
it... hey, hey.</i>

100
00:06:48,315 --> 00:06:49,249
<i>I told you,</i>

101
00:06:49,282 --> 00:06:50,382
<i>you sit down.</i>

102
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:14,882
Hello.

103
00:07:16,314 --> 00:07:18,519
What's your name?

104
00:07:22,656 --> 00:07:26,358
Oh, you, you don't know
how to answer that, do you?

105
00:07:29,191 --> 00:07:32,770
You're afraid if you answer,
you'll get hurt, huh?

106
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:39,608
Well... the only way
around that is...

107
00:07:39,641 --> 00:07:41,906
that you answer honestly.

108
00:07:44,043 --> 00:07:47,976
It's always the best policy.

109
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:52,015
Jenna.

110
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:01,824
Why don't you come
and join me, Jenna?

111
00:08:07,542 --> 00:08:09,507
Yo.

112
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,005
We can start now.

113
00:08:11,046 --> 00:08:12,711
Cops are still in the lobby.

114
00:08:12,744 --> 00:08:14,144
Well, that's their fault.

115
00:08:14,184 --> 00:08:16,448
It's time to get
their attention.

116
00:08:28,757 --> 00:08:30,460
Out of the way, out of the way.

117
00:08:30,493 --> 00:08:33,195
Stay down.

118
00:08:51,713 --> 00:08:53,649
Police.
Keep moving.

119
00:08:53,682 --> 00:08:55,081
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

120
00:08:55,114 --> 00:08:56,849
- What's going on? - Sir, we
need you to keep moving,

121
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,488
continuing out of the building.

122
00:08:58,489 --> 00:09:00,441
- Go down the stairwell.
- What's going on out there?

123
00:09:00,442 --> 00:09:02,692
- Out of the building, please.
- Take the rest of the day off.

124
00:09:02,716 --> 00:09:05,387
Move to the stairs,
exit the back of the building.

125
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:07,860
What's the update, Stahl?

126
00:09:07,893 --> 00:09:09,365
It's the Sanderson building
downtown.

127
00:09:09,398 --> 00:09:11,796
John's on the second floor
ascending.

128
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:13,163
Ascending?

129
00:09:13,196 --> 00:09:14,164
John!

130
00:09:14,197 --> 00:09:15,364
<i>What's your status?</i>

131
00:09:15,397 --> 00:09:17,971
Dorian says the building
is still structurally sound.

132
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:18,971
There's damage to the

133
00:09:19,004 --> 00:09:20,802
<i>third and fourth
emergency exits.</i>

134
00:09:20,835 --> 00:09:23,472
<i>The southeast stairwell
is also blocked.</i>

135
00:09:23,505 --> 00:09:25,145
Emergency personnel
are getting people out

136
00:09:25,177 --> 00:09:26,809
by the second story.

137
00:09:26,842 --> 00:09:30,012
John, do not ascend.
Negative.

138
00:09:30,013 --> 00:09:32,496
<i>Continue directing employees
to the second floor</i>

139
00:09:32,497 --> 00:09:33,342
<i>and go there yourself</i>

140
00:09:33,343 --> 00:09:34,611
until we know
what we're dealing with here.

141
00:09:34,612 --> 00:09:36,032
<i>I know what we're dealing with.</i>

142
00:09:36,074 --> 00:09:37,414
<i>The assailants
are still in the building.</i>

143
00:09:37,415 --> 00:09:38,620
<i>We're going after them.</i>

144
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:40,092
<i>Buy me some time.</i>

145
00:09:40,617 --> 00:09:42,080
You should initiate
the protocol.

146
00:09:42,113 --> 00:09:44,848
Jam all comm signals coming
in and out of the building,

147
00:09:44,888 --> 00:09:46,416
cut their communication,

148
00:09:46,457 --> 00:09:47,857
<i>and get me some backup.</i>

149
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,123
John, if we jam

150
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:51,258
the signal, comms won't
make it out of the building.

151
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:54,160
<i>We won't be able to communicate.</i>

152
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:56,497
Leave the building now.

153
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,802
<i>There's... I can't...</i>

154
00:09:57,835 --> 00:09:58,971
What... do...

155
00:09:59,004 --> 00:10:00,540
<i>Do you...</i>

156
00:10:00,573 --> 00:10:02,876
Christmas.

157
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:04,908
Did you just hang up
on Captain Maldonado?

158
00:10:04,941 --> 00:10:06,645
Yeah, boring
conversation anyway.

159
00:10:06,678 --> 00:10:09,151
I just love that you wear
your insubordination

160
00:10:09,184 --> 00:10:11,182
like it's a virtue.

161
00:10:11,215 --> 00:10:12,853
Did we evacuate the perimeter?

162
00:10:12,886 --> 00:10:15,357
Per protocol,
three-block radius.

163
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,926
Yeah, this is Paul.

164
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:21,999
Lock down communications.

165
00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:24,898
Initiate the jam.

166
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:27,475
Sequence initiated.

167
00:10:33,378 --> 00:10:34,744
<i>Okay, signal active.</i>

168
00:10:34,777 --> 00:10:36,207
<i>Switching to internal comms.</i>

169
00:10:36,248 --> 00:10:38,744
They jammed us.

170
00:10:38,785 --> 00:10:41,519
All external communications
are blocked.

171
00:10:41,552 --> 00:10:45,221
Law enforcement is nothing
if not predictable.

172
00:10:45,254 --> 00:10:47,254
Alpha team, take the north side.

173
00:10:47,287 --> 00:10:49,127
<i>Bravo team, take the rooftop.</i>

174
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,862
<i>Hold your fire until instructed.</i>

175
00:10:53,927 --> 00:10:56,029
Clear.

176
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,712
Any more thoughts on that plan?

177
00:11:07,745 --> 00:11:09,545
We're running out
of floors, John.

178
00:11:09,578 --> 00:11:11,879
Well, I thought backup
would be here by now.

179
00:11:11,912 --> 00:11:14,245
Guess we just keep moving up.

180
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:15,717
Maybe there's another option.

181
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,885
The entire air system

182
00:11:16,918 --> 00:11:18,549
is interconnected.

183
00:11:18,582 --> 00:11:20,822
We just have to make it
to the 23rd floor.

184
00:11:20,855 --> 00:11:23,251
There's an access door
to the air system there that'll

185
00:11:23,292 --> 00:11:25,659
- take us up to where these guys are.
- See?

186
00:11:25,692 --> 00:11:28,628
Told you we'd
come up with a plan.

187
00:11:30,695 --> 00:11:32,566
Hey.

188
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:33,966
What's with the disco face?

189
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:35,766
Got something to tell me?

190
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,703
Since the signals
are now being jammed,

191
00:11:37,744 --> 00:11:40,311
every emergency call
being placed in this building

192
00:11:40,344 --> 00:11:42,973
is bouncing back to me
because they can't get out.

193
00:11:43,014 --> 00:11:46,610
Answer the calls.
We might get some information.

194
00:11:46,643 --> 00:11:48,010
Hello?

195
00:12:00,801 --> 00:12:02,738
What are you doing?

196
00:12:02,771 --> 00:12:04,538
In the Portuguese culture,
it is proven

197
00:12:04,571 --> 00:12:06,842
that people find
a woman's voice more soothing

198
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,612
in moments of crisis.

199
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:09,812
Hello?

200
00:12:09,845 --> 00:12:11,148
Hello.

201
00:12:11,182 --> 00:12:13,116
I'm Detective John Kennex.

202
00:12:13,148 --> 00:12:16,114
I'm an automated police officer
with a very difficult personality.

203
00:12:16,147 --> 00:12:17,682
911?

204
00:12:17,715 --> 00:12:19,155
Please remain calm.

205
00:12:19,188 --> 00:12:20,787
I'm-I'm trapped with a gunman.

206
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,418
Please help.

207
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:24,657
Everything's all right.
Just take a breath.

208
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,889
What is your name?

209
00:12:25,922 --> 00:12:27,958
It's Paige.

210
00:12:27,991 --> 00:12:29,455
Hi, Paige.

211
00:12:30,561 --> 00:12:32,128
What can you tell me
about the gunmen?

212
00:12:32,162 --> 00:12:33,561
<i>I don't know.</i>

213
00:12:33,602 --> 00:12:37,230
They have my sister...

214
00:12:37,263 --> 00:12:38,669
and others.

215
00:12:38,702 --> 00:12:39,901
<i>Listen, Paige,</i>

216
00:12:39,934 --> 00:12:41,102
I'm in the building.

217
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,135
I need to ask you
a few questions,

218
00:12:43,176 --> 00:12:45,544
but first I need to know...
are you safe?

219
00:12:45,577 --> 00:12:48,145
<i>Are you out of harm's way?</i>

220
00:12:48,177 --> 00:12:49,480
I think so.

221
00:12:49,513 --> 00:12:51,712
- For now.
- Okay, listen to me.

222
00:12:51,752 --> 00:12:53,887
Where are you?
What floor are you on?

223
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,814
I'm on the 25th floor.

224
00:12:55,855 --> 00:12:59,022
I'm in the utility closet.

225
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,223
Next face.

226
00:13:03,264 --> 00:13:05,694
You, on your knees.

227
00:13:05,727 --> 00:13:07,164
On your knees!

228
00:13:07,197 --> 00:13:08,531
Oh, no, no!

229
00:13:08,564 --> 00:13:09,994
Oh, God.

230
00:13:13,395 --> 00:13:15,234
<i>Paige?</i>

231
00:13:15,267 --> 00:13:17,402
Paige, what's happening?

232
00:13:17,435 --> 00:13:19,338
They've shot him.

233
00:13:19,371 --> 00:13:22,073
<i>Lou is dead.</i>

234
00:13:30,652 --> 00:13:33,083
Hey, dogface. Water.

235
00:13:39,093 --> 00:13:40,923
<i>We got a body!</i>

236
00:13:52,306 --> 00:13:54,137
<i>Keep those people back!</i>

237
00:13:54,171 --> 00:13:57,875
Those bastards.
What do they want?

238
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:02,215
<i>Detective Paul,
initiate hostage protocol.</i>

239
00:14:02,248 --> 00:14:05,680
Send them the comm.
Send them the comm!

240
00:14:11,295 --> 00:14:13,576
Get that drone in the air.
We've got to start negotiating.

241
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:25,877
<i>Comm's here.</i>

242
00:14:37,592 --> 00:14:39,062
What's your name?

243
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:40,429
Captain Maldonado.

244
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,091
And you are?

245
00:14:42,124 --> 00:14:43,993
<i>Well, I'd tell you,
but I don't want</i>

246
00:14:44,026 --> 00:14:45,495
<i>to nullify your efforts.</i>

247
00:14:45,528 --> 00:14:48,060
Now that we have
your attention...

248
00:14:48,093 --> 00:14:51,025
we have some demands.

249
00:14:52,288 --> 00:14:54,021
<i>Paige, can you
hold the phone up</i>

250
00:14:54,053 --> 00:14:56,059
<i>so I can hear what's going on?</i>

251
00:14:56,092 --> 00:14:59,490
<i>I really hate to throw
out any more hostages.</i>

252
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:01,393
Let's get down
to brass tacks, huh?

253
00:15:01,426 --> 00:15:02,733
What do you want?

254
00:15:02,761 --> 00:15:03,928
<i>First,</i>

255
00:15:03,961 --> 00:15:06,800
get your snipers off the roof,
and tell those men

256
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,001
you have assembled out front
to stand down,

257
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:11,138
<i>and keep them away
from the building,</i>

258
00:15:11,171 --> 00:15:14,874
<i>or hostages will continue
to fall from the sky.</i>

259
00:15:18,979 --> 00:15:22,389
Tell Detective Paul
to have his men stand down.

260
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:25,420
<i>Bravo team, stand down.</i>

261
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:31,367
All clear.

262
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,232
Done.

263
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,401
<i>What else?</i>

264
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,399
We'd like three v-tols
on the roof

265
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,037
<i>standing by, clear airspace
from here to the border,</i>

266
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,572
<i>and finally, I'd like</i>

267
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:43,804
one fission igniter
delivered to me, please.

268
00:15:43,837 --> 00:15:46,710
That's military-grade
technology.

269
00:15:46,743 --> 00:15:48,414
I don't have that authority.

270
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,412
Well, then I suggest
you contact someone who does.

271
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:57,854
<i>Facial recognition identified.</i>

272
00:16:05,405 --> 00:16:07,468
Now, you listen to me, Lucas,

273
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,804
<i>if you want me
to cooperate with you,</i>

274
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:11,908
<i>I need you to cooperate with me.</i>

275
00:16:11,941 --> 00:16:14,477
How many hostages do you have?

276
00:16:14,518 --> 00:16:18,353
More than enough
to end your career

277
00:16:18,386 --> 00:16:20,088
if they die.

278
00:16:20,121 --> 00:16:22,256
<i>You have 43 minutes.</i>

279
00:16:23,627 --> 00:16:26,731
Set the timer for 43 minutes,
and get me Rudy Lom.

280
00:16:30,571 --> 00:16:32,402
Hello?

281
00:16:32,435 --> 00:16:33,835
<i>Are you there?</i>

282
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,371
Right here, Paige.

283
00:16:35,404 --> 00:16:37,212
Is anyone coming?

284
00:16:37,245 --> 00:16:38,276
You just hang tight.

285
00:16:38,309 --> 00:16:40,213
We're gonna be with
you real soon.

286
00:16:40,246 --> 00:16:42,088
Did you hear the phone call?

287
00:16:42,121 --> 00:16:43,921
Yeah, I did. Thank you.

288
00:16:43,954 --> 00:16:46,493
Just hold on a second.
I'll be right back.

289
00:16:47,294 --> 00:16:50,733
Is a fission igniter
as bad as I think it is?

290
00:16:50,766 --> 00:16:53,470
It's a trigger mechanism
for a large explosive device.

291
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,070
Megaton level.

292
00:16:55,103 --> 00:16:57,237
Megaton.

293
00:16:58,277 --> 00:17:00,074
Paige, you there?

294
00:17:00,107 --> 00:17:04,071
Can you tell me how many
hostages they've got up there?

295
00:17:04,104 --> 00:17:06,144
25 or so.

296
00:17:06,177 --> 00:17:08,113
At least in this room.

297
00:17:08,146 --> 00:17:10,114
It's hard for me to see.

298
00:17:10,147 --> 00:17:11,714
<i>You're doing great, Paige.</i>

299
00:17:11,755 --> 00:17:13,186
How's your sister?

300
00:17:13,219 --> 00:17:15,256
This is all my fault.

301
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:18,318
She wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for me.

302
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:20,556
She's visiting from out of town.

303
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:22,091
She just stopped by

304
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,220
to have lunch...

305
00:17:24,261 --> 00:17:26,758
and now she's all alone.

306
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,599
Paige, can you tell me
how many gunmen there are?

307
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:33,533
People keep coming and going;
I don't know.

308
00:17:33,566 --> 00:17:36,701
Five... six, at least.

309
00:17:36,741 --> 00:17:39,203
But there were more.

310
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,942
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

311
00:17:42,983 --> 00:17:45,783
I'm so scared.

312
00:17:47,584 --> 00:17:49,689
Paige, you ever
been ice fishing?

313
00:17:51,724 --> 00:17:52,796
No.

314
00:17:52,829 --> 00:17:54,564
<i>When I was 11 years old,</i>

315
00:17:54,597 --> 00:17:58,364
my dad took me ice fishing
to Lake McFarland.

316
00:17:58,397 --> 00:18:01,572
<i>We were coming back,
and all of a sudden</i>

317
00:18:01,605 --> 00:18:05,408
<i>the ice cracked,
and I went right under.</i>

318
00:18:05,449 --> 00:18:08,147
I couldn't see,
I couldn't breathe.

319
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:11,281
I thought I was gonna die.

320
00:18:11,322 --> 00:18:14,689
<i>The water was so cold, it was
like thousands of needles</i>

321
00:18:14,722 --> 00:18:17,194
<i>stinging every part of my body.</i>

322
00:18:17,227 --> 00:18:19,794
And then my dad jumped in,

323
00:18:19,827 --> 00:18:23,296
and he grabbed me and started
dragging me back to shore.

324
00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:26,296
Are you trying to
put her to sleep?

325
00:18:26,337 --> 00:18:29,399
<i>And even though we were
still in a lot of danger,</i>

326
00:18:29,432 --> 00:18:31,040
<i>I felt safe.</i>

327
00:18:31,073 --> 00:18:32,474
<i>I felt like...</i>

328
00:18:32,507 --> 00:18:34,842
everything was gonna be okay,

329
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,977
because I wasn't alone.

330
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,247
<i>Paige...</i>

331
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,478
you're not alone.

332
00:18:41,511 --> 00:18:43,246
I'm with you.

333
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:46,413
<i>Everything is gonna be okay.</i>

334
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,486
Do you believe me?

335
00:18:51,392 --> 00:18:53,657
Yeah, I do.

336
00:18:53,698 --> 00:18:55,730
<i>All right, good girl.</i>

337
00:18:55,763 --> 00:18:57,865
You just hang in there.

338
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:05,579
Yeah. Paul.

339
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:07,609
<i>Any sign of Kennex and Dorian?</i>

340
00:19:07,642 --> 00:19:08,808
Uh, nothing so far.

341
00:19:08,841 --> 00:19:10,806
<i>Keep your men back,
but I want drones</i>

342
00:19:10,847 --> 00:19:12,647
and spotters
on every window and exit.

343
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,545
I want to know
what's happening with my men.

344
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:15,882
Yeah, you got it, Captain.

345
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,720
There's no way
I can get a fission igniter.

346
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:27,397
What if there was a way
to give them what they wanted

347
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,637
and stall them at the same time?

348
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:30,901
What have you got?

349
00:19:30,934 --> 00:19:32,572
I could build a replica.

350
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:34,708
What if they can spot a fake?

351
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:37,577
I can make one
that will pass a scan.

352
00:19:37,618 --> 00:19:40,313
If they test it out
or try and use it immediately,

353
00:19:40,354 --> 00:19:41,849
then we're out of luck.

354
00:19:41,882 --> 00:19:43,649
That's risk we'll have to take.

355
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:44,785
Let's get started.

356
00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:47,656
- Captain?
- Yep?

357
00:19:47,689 --> 00:19:50,328
Lucas Vincent... he's
a high-level operative

358
00:19:50,361 --> 00:19:52,424
in the Holy Reclamation Army,

359
00:19:52,465 --> 00:19:54,105
a decentralized network
of terrorist cells

360
00:19:54,131 --> 00:19:57,035
with anti-Western bias
and a history of hostage taking,

361
00:19:57,068 --> 00:19:58,938
none of them ending well.

362
00:19:58,971 --> 00:20:01,272
Last August they took over
an embassy near Tokyo.

363
00:20:01,305 --> 00:20:03,735
Same MO...
they enter with force,

364
00:20:03,776 --> 00:20:05,903
drew the attention of the media
and law enforcement

365
00:20:05,944 --> 00:20:08,279
using human hostages as
collateral for their demands.

366
00:20:08,312 --> 00:20:10,143
- What happened?
- They facilitated

367
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:12,110
the release of several
of their comrades.

368
00:20:12,143 --> 00:20:15,241
Once they got what they wanted,
they released the hostages.

369
00:20:15,274 --> 00:20:17,648
But they're not afraid
to take lives...

370
00:20:17,681 --> 00:20:19,145
including their own.

371
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:26,537
You know, everyone
trips on stairs,

372
00:20:26,554 --> 00:20:30,764
and it's calculated to occur
in one in every 2,222 occasions.

373
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:32,534
That's very interesting.

374
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:34,836
- You know what would be interesting, John?
- What?

375
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:37,634
If you told me that
ice fishing story again.

376
00:20:51,672 --> 00:20:55,208
If you want to get in shape, we can
run the O-course every weekend.

377
00:20:55,241 --> 00:20:56,945
O-can we?

378
00:21:07,561 --> 00:21:09,825
Let's split up.

379
00:22:31,842 --> 00:22:34,608
Dorian, you okay?

380
00:22:34,641 --> 00:22:37,040
<i>John, get over here.</i>

381
00:22:49,222 --> 00:22:51,657
Floor's clear.

382
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:54,286
You okay?

383
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:56,286
You took one to the head.

384
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:59,423
Yeah, ricochet.

385
00:22:59,464 --> 00:23:01,789
Whatcha got?

386
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:02,957
I'm not sure.

387
00:23:02,997 --> 00:23:04,395
But there's writing on it.

388
00:23:04,428 --> 00:23:05,364
"Start."

389
00:23:05,397 --> 00:23:08,068
- Start?
- Start.

390
00:23:09,468 --> 00:23:11,401
You I.D.'d him?

391
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,937
His name is Michael Demerais.

392
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:20,103
He's a member of
the Holy Reclamation Army.

393
00:23:20,136 --> 00:23:21,974
So they're behind this.

394
00:23:24,109 --> 00:23:26,372
Maybe not.

395
00:23:32,783 --> 00:23:35,452
It's a facemaker.

396
00:23:39,622 --> 00:23:41,491
So who's this guy?

397
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,398
His name is Gregor Stone.

398
00:23:45,431 --> 00:23:47,233
He has a few priors
for armed robbery.

399
00:23:47,266 --> 00:23:48,602
Why would they
impersonate members

400
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,678
of a radical organization?

401
00:23:50,711 --> 00:23:53,612
What's wrong?

402
00:23:53,645 --> 00:23:57,178
My dynamic voltage scaling
has been damaged by the bullet.

403
00:23:57,211 --> 00:23:59,713
You want to say that
a little less complicated?

404
00:23:59,747 --> 00:24:02,552
I won't be able to walk
in five minutes.

405
00:24:09,518 --> 00:24:11,215
Where are our v-tols?

406
00:24:11,748 --> 00:24:13,419
I'm working on it.

407
00:24:19,021 --> 00:24:21,854
Based on the frequency
at which these transmit...

408
00:24:21,887 --> 00:24:24,626
I detect seven facemakers
in the building.

409
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:26,797
If they hide their identities,

410
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,628
why not just wear a mask?

411
00:24:28,661 --> 00:24:30,931
Why pretend to be
something else?

412
00:24:30,964 --> 00:24:33,365
That's a good question.

413
00:24:41,373 --> 00:24:43,444
All right.

414
00:24:43,477 --> 00:24:45,307
Let's try and fix you.

415
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,744
How does it look?

416
00:24:50,777 --> 00:24:53,183
Yeah, it's, uh, totally fine.

417
00:24:53,216 --> 00:24:54,479
You can hardly see it.

418
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,854
Okay.

419
00:24:55,887 --> 00:24:57,354
So, what do I do?

420
00:24:57,388 --> 00:24:59,886
All right, there's a
magenta colored tendon.

421
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,591
I need you to cut it.

422
00:25:03,255 --> 00:25:05,154
All right, is...
is that thing clean?

423
00:25:05,188 --> 00:25:06,658
Of course it is.

424
00:25:06,691 --> 00:25:08,458
Are you sure?

425
00:25:08,491 --> 00:25:09,996
Positive.

426
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:13,499
Damn it.

427
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,368
- I said magenta.
- It was magenta.

428
00:25:15,369 --> 00:25:17,399
- I said magenta. That was lavender.
- The hell's magenta?

429
00:25:17,403 --> 00:25:18,968
There's 50 shades
of purple in there.

430
00:25:18,969 --> 00:25:20,998
I'm telling you,
that was the lavender one.

431
00:25:21,211 --> 00:25:22,928
- No, no. Okay, wait a minute.
- What?

432
00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:24,660
- What are you doing with that?
- Gotta cut the wire.

433
00:25:24,662 --> 00:25:26,062
That's not going
inside of my head.

434
00:25:26,063 --> 00:25:27,835
- I'm your partner, trust me.
- If Rudy were here,

435
00:25:27,853 --> 00:25:29,964
he'd have a really big issue
with you right now.

436
00:25:29,965 --> 00:25:31,645
- John...
- Look, it could always be worse.

437
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,770
- John, the statistics...
- You're going to be fine.

438
00:25:36,762 --> 00:25:38,740
Dorian?

439
00:25:51,521 --> 00:25:54,992
Please stop looking at me
like that.

440
00:25:55,025 --> 00:25:56,593
You have five minutes to deliver

441
00:25:56,626 --> 00:25:58,396
the decoy fission device.

442
00:25:58,429 --> 00:26:01,734
I'm working as fast as I can.

443
00:26:02,974 --> 00:26:05,110
Four minutes, 45 seconds.

444
00:26:05,143 --> 00:26:08,849
You can't put a clock
on perfection.

445
00:26:08,882 --> 00:26:10,545
Clearly someone was rushing

446
00:26:10,586 --> 00:26:13,080
when they designed
your manners chip.

447
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:21,661
<i>John, are you there?</i>

448
00:26:21,694 --> 00:26:24,167
I can hear you, Paige.

449
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,736
They've moved.

450
00:26:25,769 --> 00:26:27,872
They keep going
to a corner window...

451
00:26:27,905 --> 00:26:29,712
<i>doing something.</i>

452
00:26:29,745 --> 00:26:31,176
<i>What are they doing?</i>

453
00:26:31,209 --> 00:26:33,711
I don't know.

454
00:26:35,615 --> 00:26:39,321
My sister... she's crying.

455
00:26:39,354 --> 00:26:41,988
And one of the guards,
he keeps looking at her.

456
00:26:42,029 --> 00:26:46,198
Look, I promise I'll get
to you soon, Paige.

457
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:48,430
What's your sister's name?

458
00:26:48,471 --> 00:26:49,903
Jenna.

459
00:26:49,936 --> 00:26:51,240
Jenna?

460
00:26:51,273 --> 00:26:53,209
Her middle name's Gertrude.

461
00:26:53,243 --> 00:26:55,074
Ooh, that's rough.

462
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:57,113
<i>What's yours?</i>

463
00:26:57,146 --> 00:26:59,880
Oh, no. No, no,
we're not doing that.

464
00:26:59,913 --> 00:27:02,480
<i>Come on, tell me.</i>

465
00:27:05,819 --> 00:27:09,565
All right, but you better not
tell anyone, okay?

466
00:27:09,598 --> 00:27:11,692
Police orders.

467
00:27:13,101 --> 00:27:14,932
It's Reginald.

468
00:27:14,965 --> 00:27:17,373
My dad was a big Elton John fan.

469
00:27:17,406 --> 00:27:18,974
Who?

470
00:27:19,007 --> 00:27:20,239
Elton John.

471
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:21,639
He's an old-time singer.

472
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,976
Apparently, his real name
was Reginald.

473
00:27:26,586 --> 00:27:27,682
You okay?

474
00:27:27,723 --> 00:27:30,721
<i>Huh?</i>

475
00:27:30,754 --> 00:27:31,888
Gross.

476
00:27:31,921 --> 00:27:33,224
But good.

477
00:27:33,257 --> 00:27:35,194
<i>Something's happening.</i>

478
00:27:35,495 --> 00:27:37,259
<i>Get over here and help.</i>

479
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,899
One of the gunmen,

480
00:27:39,932 --> 00:27:41,336
he's hurt.

481
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:42,501
Who shot you?

482
00:27:42,502 --> 00:27:44,776
There are two men
in the building.

483
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:46,114
Cops?

484
00:27:46,148 --> 00:27:47,685
I don't know.

485
00:27:47,718 --> 00:27:49,823
Where's Gregor?

486
00:27:49,856 --> 00:27:51,159
We got separated.

487
00:27:51,192 --> 00:27:52,528
Do you want us to look for him?

488
00:27:52,533 --> 00:27:53,934
No.

489
00:27:54,195 --> 00:27:56,837
Put more men on the stairwell.
No one gets up on this floor.

490
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:59,334
Go. You, go.

491
00:27:59,671 --> 00:28:02,512
John, they know
you're in the building.

492
00:28:02,545 --> 00:28:06,575
<i>They sent a couple guys with
giant guns to guard the stairs.</i>

493
00:28:07,846 --> 00:28:09,148
Even if you do get up here,

494
00:28:09,181 --> 00:28:11,444
<i>how are you gonna get in?</i>

495
00:28:11,485 --> 00:28:12,481
Trust me, Paige.

496
00:28:12,514 --> 00:28:15,085
We'll find a way to get to you.

497
00:28:18,862 --> 00:28:21,322
<i>I'm disappointed in
you, Captain Maldonado.</i>

498
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,326
I thought we were getting along
so well.

499
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,496
I don't know what
you're talking about.

500
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,434
I said no cops.

501
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,775
I pulled my men back.

502
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,969
The only people I have there
are conducting the evacuation,

503
00:28:32,972 --> 00:28:34,910
outside the building.

504
00:28:34,943 --> 00:28:37,210
Then how do you explain
the two cops

505
00:28:37,243 --> 00:28:39,944
my men just killed downstairs?

506
00:28:41,146 --> 00:28:43,357
He's bluffing.

507
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:45,663
I don't know what men
you killed,

508
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:47,563
<i>but they weren't mine.</i>

509
00:28:48,896 --> 00:28:50,298
<i>We made a deal.</i>

510
00:28:50,331 --> 00:28:53,167
I get you what you want,
no one else dies.

511
00:29:00,775 --> 00:29:03,273
<i>When do I get
my fission ignitor?</i>

512
00:29:05,349 --> 00:29:07,750
It's on its way,
ten minutes or less.

513
00:29:07,883 --> 00:29:09,552
<i>Great. Every minute longer</i>

514
00:29:09,585 --> 00:29:12,621
is another body you'll be
scraping off the pavement.

515
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:29,000
Keep your mouth shut.

516
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,638
<i>John?</i>

517
00:29:36,533 --> 00:29:38,330
<i>I'm going out there.</i>

518
00:29:38,369 --> 00:29:40,230
I can't leave Jenna alone.

519
00:29:41,564 --> 00:29:43,166
<i>Paige, that's a bad idea.</i>

520
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:44,501
I have to.

521
00:29:44,634 --> 00:29:46,368
<i>We're a few floors away.</i>

522
00:29:46,401 --> 00:29:48,032
She needs me.

523
00:29:48,465 --> 00:29:51,072
<i>I need her.</i>

524
00:29:51,105 --> 00:29:54,485
If we're gonna die...

525
00:29:54,904 --> 00:29:57,910
...I want to be with her.

526
00:29:57,943 --> 00:30:02,080
<i>She's my sister.</i>

527
00:30:03,186 --> 00:30:05,518
Now is my only chance
to blend in

528
00:30:05,551 --> 00:30:06,551
without anyone seeing me.

529
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:08,250
Paige, just stay where you are.

530
00:30:08,283 --> 00:30:09,454
I'll leave my phone open.

531
00:30:09,487 --> 00:30:10,958
You'll be able to hear
what's going on.

532
00:30:10,991 --> 00:30:12,425
Paige, it's too risky.

533
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:14,324
Listen to me, just stay put.

534
00:30:14,357 --> 00:30:16,122
I have to. I have to.

535
00:30:16,155 --> 00:30:17,221
Paige, please,

536
00:30:17,254 --> 00:30:19,859
just listen to me. Paige.

537
00:30:19,892 --> 00:30:22,901
<i>Paige, are you there? Paige?</i>

538
00:30:42,512 --> 00:30:44,647
<i>I think I can do that.</i>

539
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,150
I'm here.

540
00:30:48,183 --> 00:30:50,684
It'll be okay.

541
00:30:54,773 --> 00:30:56,036
<i>Detective Paul?</i>

542
00:30:56,069 --> 00:30:57,936
Copy. The ignitor
is ready for delivery.

543
00:30:57,969 --> 00:30:59,168
Come on.

544
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:01,240
Come on, come on, speed it up.

545
00:31:03,126 --> 00:31:04,493
It's good to go, sir.

546
00:31:04,534 --> 00:31:06,334
Okay, waiting on your order.

547
00:31:07,239 --> 00:31:09,135
Send it.

548
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:11,006
Let's get her up.

549
00:31:36,257 --> 00:31:38,994
Excuse me.

550
00:31:39,027 --> 00:31:40,867
I have to go to the bathroom.

551
00:31:44,635 --> 00:31:47,704
You're not going to make me
pee on the floor, are you?

552
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,704
You've got 30 seconds.

553
00:31:50,737 --> 00:31:53,674
<i>Hey, boss...</i>

554
00:31:53,715 --> 00:31:55,547
<i>we're getting another delivery.</i>

555
00:32:06,764 --> 00:32:08,929
<i>The drone's coming.</i>

556
00:32:30,781 --> 00:32:32,421
We had an agreement, Lucas.

557
00:32:32,454 --> 00:32:34,390
We've operated
in good faith here.

558
00:32:34,423 --> 00:32:36,462
<i>I believe in honoring a deal.</i>

559
00:32:36,495 --> 00:32:38,630
<i>Stand by.</i>

560
00:32:38,663 --> 00:32:42,262
I'll let you know how we're
gonna release the hostages.

561
00:32:45,168 --> 00:32:46,870
Let's hope they buy it.

562
00:32:46,903 --> 00:32:49,373
Send the message
to the other crew now.

563
00:32:50,438 --> 00:32:51,973
They should be ready.

564
00:32:52,006 --> 00:32:53,772
It's time to wind this up.

565
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,340
What other crew?

566
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,243
Maybe there are more of them
in the building.

567
00:32:58,277 --> 00:33:00,579
- Maybe they're outside the building.
- But the jammer's

568
00:33:00,612 --> 00:33:02,011
still on.
If they have people outside,

569
00:33:02,052 --> 00:33:03,851
they wouldn't be able
to talk to each other.

570
00:33:03,884 --> 00:33:07,251
Unless they were talking
some other way.

571
00:33:15,629 --> 00:33:17,761
"Start."

572
00:33:27,615 --> 00:33:28,910
They must be using it

573
00:33:28,943 --> 00:33:30,677
as some sort
of point-to-point communication

574
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31,844
with someone in proximity

575
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:34,684
- of the building.
- Paige said the man in charge...

576
00:33:34,717 --> 00:33:36,516
kept going to the window.

577
00:33:48,229 --> 00:33:49,701
I didn't think
they'd come through.

578
00:33:49,734 --> 00:33:52,569
What if there's
a tracking device?

579
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,305
We're not taking it anyway.

580
00:33:54,338 --> 00:33:56,944
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

581
00:34:00,248 --> 00:34:02,945
He doesn't want the tech.
That doesn't make sense.

582
00:34:04,453 --> 00:34:06,957
Why take hostages and negotiate
for tech you don't want?

583
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,694
Maybe it's a diversion.

584
00:34:08,727 --> 00:34:11,566
Yeah, but for what?

585
00:34:13,464 --> 00:34:15,305
Are there any targets

586
00:34:15,338 --> 00:34:17,403
of value
in the adjacent buildings?

587
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,749
The only target of any value is

588
00:34:22,782 --> 00:34:25,919
a precious metal weigh station
specializing in palladium.

589
00:34:27,689 --> 00:34:28,959
It's a heist.

590
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:31,927
Palladium. That would make
all this worthwhile.

591
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,415
Wrap it up.

592
00:34:51,448 --> 00:34:52,912
We're out of here in ten.

593
00:35:06,768 --> 00:35:09,304
Hang in there, Daniel.

594
00:35:09,337 --> 00:35:10,776
When this is over,

595
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:12,808
we'll all be on
a beach somewhere,

596
00:35:12,841 --> 00:35:14,546
you'll be as good as new.

597
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:17,081
I need a doctor.

598
00:35:17,114 --> 00:35:19,249
Soon.

599
00:35:30,472 --> 00:35:31,967
What's that beeping?

600
00:35:33,103 --> 00:35:35,699
You and the guys pick
three hostages.

601
00:35:35,739 --> 00:35:37,465
Why?

602
00:35:37,506 --> 00:35:40,171
We may need insurance.

603
00:35:40,212 --> 00:35:41,580
Let's pack it up.

604
00:35:41,613 --> 00:35:44,247
John, they've activated
a light bomb.

605
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,813
They're gonna kill
the hostages.

606
00:35:51,417 --> 00:35:52,486
What are you doing?

607
00:35:52,504 --> 00:35:54,079
Sticking to the plan.
We're going up.

608
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,201
John, they know we're here.

609
00:35:55,216 --> 00:35:56,719
They're expecting us
to come up the stairs.

610
00:35:56,752 --> 00:35:58,886
We won't make it
to the 25th floor alive.

611
00:35:58,886 --> 00:36:00,283
You heard him.

612
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,568
We have no choice.

613
00:36:01,568 --> 00:36:03,779
I don't have a choice.

614
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:06,863
People's lives are in jeopardy.

615
00:36:06,896 --> 00:36:09,168
Dorian, you've been shot.
Your head's

616
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:11,873
full of bubble gum.
You can't do this alone.

617
00:36:11,906 --> 00:36:13,072
I have to.

618
00:36:13,105 --> 00:36:14,872
Then I'm coming with you.

619
00:36:14,905 --> 00:36:16,074
You can't.

620
00:36:17,147 --> 00:36:20,115
I'm designed to do this, John.

621
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,223
It's time.

622
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:57,887
Jenna...

623
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,559
why don't you come with me.

624
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,728
No, no, no.
Don't you touch her.

625
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,266
Don't you touch her. Take me!

626
00:37:03,299 --> 00:37:05,035
Let her go! I will shoot you!

627
00:37:05,068 --> 00:37:06,972
No, no!
Take me! No, leave her!

628
00:37:07,005 --> 00:37:09,069
Take me! Please! Me!

629
00:37:14,349 --> 00:37:15,612
Police! Get down!

630
00:37:37,729 --> 00:37:39,169
What's your name?

631
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:44,244
I've never killed a man
I didn't know.

632
00:37:45,479 --> 00:37:47,445
But then again...

633
00:37:47,478 --> 00:37:49,609
you're not a man.

634
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:52,110
Are you?

635
00:37:53,911 --> 00:37:56,480
Nice of you to show up, Gregor.

636
00:37:56,521 --> 00:37:57,888
Where the hell have you been?

637
00:37:57,921 --> 00:38:00,887
We thought you were dead.

638
00:38:11,563 --> 00:38:13,030
Maldonado?

639
00:38:13,063 --> 00:38:13,666
John?

640
00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:15,302
<i>The hostages are secure.</i>

641
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:16,901
<i>The whole thing
is a palladium heist.</i>

642
00:38:16,934 --> 00:38:18,005
Shut it off... now!

643
00:38:18,038 --> 00:38:20,069
<i>They got us to block
the alarm system.</i>

644
00:38:20,102 --> 00:38:22,237
<i>Turn the jammer off!</i>

645
00:38:22,706 --> 00:38:24,909
Detective Paul,
turn off the jammer now!

646
00:38:24,942 --> 00:38:26,710
Shut it off.

647
00:38:37,888 --> 00:38:38,823
Let's go.

648
00:38:57,274 --> 00:38:59,577
Thank you.

649
00:39:06,747 --> 00:39:08,787
John?

650
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,124
You must be Paige.

651
00:39:19,132 --> 00:39:20,626
Thank you.

652
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:22,299
No. Thank you.

653
00:39:22,332 --> 00:39:23,838
You were very brave.

654
00:39:23,871 --> 00:39:26,039
You helped save a
lot of lives today.

655
00:39:26,904 --> 00:39:29,079
Where's your partner?

656
00:39:29,112 --> 00:39:31,744
Oh, he's, uh...

657
00:39:31,778 --> 00:39:35,484
he's getting patched up.

658
00:39:36,927 --> 00:39:38,894
John, this is my sister.

659
00:39:38,927 --> 00:39:40,662
This is Jenna.

660
00:39:40,695 --> 00:39:42,766
Jenna, it's a
pleasure to meet you.

661
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:44,366
I've heard a lot about you.

662
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:12,732
I'm glad you're okay.

663
00:40:12,765 --> 00:40:14,383
Thanks.

664
00:40:14,466 --> 00:40:17,040
I've got some
intel on the perps.

665
00:40:17,074 --> 00:40:19,440
Guy behind it all
was Gerald Leighton.

666
00:40:19,474 --> 00:40:21,006
We linked him and his men

667
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:23,572
to four high-value robberies
in the last two years.

668
00:40:23,605 --> 00:40:26,445
Using police jamming protocol
to initiate a palladium heist.

669
00:40:26,478 --> 00:40:28,427
Pretty elaborate
for a bunch of thieves.

670
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:29,996
It's going
to be a paperwork nightmare.

671
00:40:30,183 --> 00:40:32,151
And I thought you had come
down here to thank me.

672
00:40:32,184 --> 00:40:33,887
For what? Doing your job?

673
00:40:33,921 --> 00:40:35,824
Just for the record,

674
00:40:35,857 --> 00:40:38,329
I did tell you to get out
of the building, right?

675
00:40:38,362 --> 00:40:42,229
I swear, all I heard was static.

676
00:40:42,262 --> 00:40:46,000
Oi! I've got a bone to pick
with you, Detective.

677
00:40:46,033 --> 00:40:47,472
Chewing gum? Really?

678
00:40:47,505 --> 00:40:49,199
Would you fix a race car
with chewing gum?

679
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,733
Uh, yeah, if it was busted,
and I need to win a race.

680
00:40:52,071 --> 00:40:54,372
He'll need extensive
diagnostics.

681
00:40:54,405 --> 00:40:56,608
Ah, that can wait.

682
00:40:56,649 --> 00:40:59,848
Come on, let's go
get some noodles.

683
00:41:00,882 --> 00:41:02,217
You are aware that I don't eat.

684
00:41:02,649 --> 00:41:04,887
Perfect. I'm buying. Let's roll.

685
00:41:10,527 --> 00:41:13,426
Well, I'll just wait here,
shall I?

686
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:23,714
Thank you for what
you did back there.

687
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:27,453
Don't mention it.

688
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:33,061
Besides, no one messes
with my coffee warmer.

689
00:41:38,169 --> 00:41:40,842
Hey, John, you know
that story you told Paige,

690
00:41:40,875 --> 00:41:43,439
when you fell through the ice
as a kid?

691
00:41:45,774 --> 00:41:47,974
When that gun
was pointed at my head,

692
00:41:48,015 --> 00:41:50,111
I felt something similar.

693
00:41:53,248 --> 00:41:55,689
I-I didn't want to die.

694
00:41:58,093 --> 00:42:01,064
I know it's not the same
with me, but...

695
00:42:01,105 --> 00:42:03,232
Hey, dead is dead.

696
00:42:06,538 --> 00:42:08,508
Yeah.

697
00:42:08,549 --> 00:42:11,213
I suppose so.

698
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:18,963
Why don't you chuck
some music on?
