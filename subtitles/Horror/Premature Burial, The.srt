1
00:00:53,748 --> 00:00:57,040
All right, so here's how you can
tell, in order of weirdness,

2
00:00:57,082 --> 00:00:59,039
that this is a dream.

3
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,540
First off, I'm having sex.

4
00:01:02,582 --> 00:01:06,331
Second, I'm on a heart-shaped
bed with red rubber sheets.

5
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:07,956
Nice.

6
00:01:07,957 --> 00:01:09,081
Are those beakers?

7
00:01:09,082 --> 00:01:10,331
Yep, I'm in my chemistry class.

8
00:01:10,332 --> 00:01:12,581
That's third.

9
00:01:12,582 --> 00:01:14,997
And this woman is just perfect.

10
00:01:14,998 --> 00:01:16,373
I mean, look at her.

11
00:01:16,415 --> 00:01:20,747
Those eyes... Those lips...

12
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:23,289
Those three tits.

13
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:27,540
I would tell you the fifth,
but this is about the time where I --

14
00:01:31,998 --> 00:01:37,747
<i> I'm bit part player in the story of my life <i>

15
00:01:37,748 --> 00:01:44,247
<i> and I can't wake up, but I just won't sleep at night <i>

16
00:01:44,248 --> 00:01:47,747
<i> but maybe I'm alive and maybe I'm dead <i>

17
00:01:47,748 --> 00:01:50,997
<i> the things you say went around my head <i>

18
00:01:50,998 --> 00:01:56,414
<i> empty words that sound like shit to me <i>

19
00:01:56,415 --> 00:01:59,122
<i> turn around, round, round, round, round, round <i>

20
00:01:59,123 --> 00:02:01,997
<i> turn it around <i>

21
00:02:01,998 --> 00:02:05,373
<i> turn around, round, round, round, round, round <i>

22
00:02:09,415 --> 00:02:13,540
just... throw the sheets
in the laundry, hon.

23
00:02:26,748 --> 00:02:28,081
It's okay.

24
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:29,540
She's in the laundry room.

25
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:30,747
Sit down.

26
00:02:30,748 --> 00:02:33,207
I should probably be going to school, so...

27
00:02:33,248 --> 00:02:35,040
We both know how important

28
00:02:35,082 --> 00:02:36,164
today's interview is.

29
00:02:36,165 --> 00:02:37,747
Dad, I really don't need

30
00:02:37,748 --> 00:02:39,247
another pep talk.

31
00:02:39,249 --> 00:02:43,706
When you were benched in little league
and your team played with 8 players,

32
00:02:43,707 --> 00:02:45,039
I said nothing.

33
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,622
When you were bullied by Sally Levinson...

34
00:02:48,623 --> 00:02:49,997
I said nothing.

35
00:02:49,998 --> 00:02:51,414
When you lost the class

36
00:02:51,415 --> 00:02:53,206
presidency to a raccoon...

37
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:55,789
He was the school mascot.

38
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:56,873
...I said nothing.

39
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,039
But this is too important to me

40
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,039
to just sit idly by and say nothing.

41
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,664
So, come on. Please.

42
00:03:04,665 --> 00:03:06,415
Okay. Fine.

43
00:03:08,707 --> 00:03:12,331
I want you to wear this during the interview.

44
00:03:12,332 --> 00:03:13,747
This is my old headband from

45
00:03:13,748 --> 00:03:16,039
when I rowed crew at Georgetown.

46
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:21,373
But... I don't row crew.

47
00:03:21,415 --> 00:03:24,372
Oh, God. This smells
like crotch.

48
00:03:24,373 --> 00:03:27,873
That's the smell of a champion.

49
00:03:27,915 --> 00:03:31,207
Today you have a huge opportunity.

50
00:03:31,248 --> 00:03:34,164
Today you'll make me proud.

51
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:36,956
It would save me time if I would

52
00:03:36,957 --> 00:03:38,497
just put down newspaper on

53
00:03:38,498 --> 00:03:40,707
his... Bed.

54
00:03:47,248 --> 00:03:50,997
<i> I was supposed to do great things <i>

55
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:54,081
<i> I know the road was long <i>

56
00:03:54,082 --> 00:03:57,664
<i> but I wasn't raised to shoot for fame <i>

57
00:03:57,665 --> 00:04:00,539
<i> I had the safety on <i>

58
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:07,247
<i> ooh, ooh, ooh <i>

59
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:11,247
<i> I cut my ties, I sold my rings <i>

60
00:04:11,248 --> 00:04:13,956
<i> I wanted none of this <i>

61
00:04:13,957 --> 00:04:17,664
<i> if you start from scratch, you have to sing <i>

62
00:04:17,665 --> 00:04:19,289
<i> just for the fun of it <i>

63
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,081
cute dress!

64
00:04:20,082 --> 00:04:21,622
Hello, Lisa.

65
00:04:21,623 --> 00:04:24,790
Why is he near us?

66
00:04:26,957 --> 00:04:28,206
Have a good day at school.

67
00:04:28,207 --> 00:04:29,664
Rob!

68
00:04:29,665 --> 00:04:32,039
Yo, Rob!

69
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,373
Ah!

70
00:04:33,415 --> 00:04:34,665
Oh.

71
00:04:39,498 --> 00:04:40,414
Hey, are you okay?

72
00:04:40,415 --> 00:04:41,956
Shh.

73
00:04:41,957 --> 00:04:43,581
So, I'm about to blow my load

74
00:04:43,582 --> 00:04:44,956
when Lisa says, "wait."

75
00:04:44,957 --> 00:04:47,372
She then stands up, gets dressed,

76
00:04:47,373 --> 00:04:49,039
turns to me and says,

77
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,914
"okay.

78
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,372
Come now."

79
00:04:51,373 --> 00:04:53,622
And boom.

80
00:04:53,623 --> 00:04:54,540
I came.

81
00:04:54,582 --> 00:04:56,664
How does a high school chick

82
00:04:56,665 --> 00:04:58,039
learn mind control like that?

83
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,622
Maybe some sort of magnet school
for the sexually advanced?

84
00:05:01,623 --> 00:05:03,122
You're gonna love sex.

85
00:05:03,123 --> 00:05:04,581
It's like jerking off with the

86
00:05:04,582 --> 00:05:05,997
best sock on the planet.

87
00:05:05,998 --> 00:05:07,372
Wait.

88
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:10,039
What? Why are you dressed like Ellen Degeneres?

89
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,622
I have my interview today.

90
00:05:12,623 --> 00:05:14,207
I'm not dressed like Ellen.

91
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:16,122
So, what are you gonna do if you don't get in?

92
00:05:16,123 --> 00:05:18,207
Hey. No. Shut up, okay?

93
00:05:18,248 --> 00:05:19,164
I have to get in.

94
00:05:19,165 --> 00:05:20,582
Don't jinx me.

95
00:05:21,165 --> 00:05:22,164
So I'll kill a chicken.

96
00:05:22,165 --> 00:05:24,207
Relax.

97
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,414
Hey, man. You want to
come over tonight?

98
00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:32,747
I'm playing "Grand Theft Auto" online
with that kid from the Balkans.

99
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:34,997
You know, he sent me
this fucked-up YouTube clip.

100
00:05:34,998 --> 00:05:36,581
Some MMA guy got punched in the

101
00:05:36,582 --> 00:05:39,539
nuts so hard he shit himself and came.

102
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,039
Wow, uh, as much as I'd love to see that,

103
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,747
Gabrielle and I are
watching the spelling bee tonight.

104
00:05:43,748 --> 00:05:45,081
Hi, guys.

105
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:49,997
The dork super bowl? No, dude, it's, like, trembling
kids, terrified of disappointing their watching parents.

106
00:05:49,998 --> 00:05:51,081
I mean, it's like watching

107
00:05:51,082 --> 00:05:52,039
televised child abuse.

108
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,247
It's fucking awesome.

109
00:05:53,248 --> 00:05:54,956
They don't get punched, but they do shit themselves.

110
00:05:54,957 --> 00:05:55,914
Huh.

111
00:05:55,915 --> 00:05:57,581
And a good morning to you both.

112
00:05:57,582 --> 00:05:58,414
Hey, Gabs.

113
00:05:58,415 --> 00:05:59,164
Thanks.

114
00:05:59,165 --> 00:06:00,039
Arthur.

115
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,831
What time you flying out, Artie?

116
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:05,540
Funny, Stanley. Too bad the special Olympics
doesn't have a comedy competition.

117
00:06:05,582 --> 00:06:08,706
So, Rob, Gabrielle told me your
Georgetown interview is today.

118
00:06:08,707 --> 00:06:09,872
Uh, yeah.

119
00:06:09,873 --> 00:06:10,873
I'm a little nervous.

120
00:06:10,915 --> 00:06:12,581
Want me to put in a good word?

121
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:16,540
They've been on my jock about going there
full ride since I was in middle school.

122
00:06:16,582 --> 00:06:18,622
Really? Since middle school?

123
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,581
It's a lot of pressure
for a 7-year-old.

124
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:22,747
Good morning.

125
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:23,956
Morning, Mr. Hughes.

126
00:06:23,957 --> 00:06:26,164
Arthur, I thought you were going to be here early.

127
00:06:26,165 --> 00:06:29,456
Excuse me for a second.

128
00:06:29,457 --> 00:06:32,206
Get off my scrotum, Mr. Hughes.
I have your lesson plan, but

129
00:06:32,207 --> 00:06:34,747
what I don't have is my money.

130
00:06:34,748 --> 00:06:35,747
It's in my classroom.

131
00:06:35,748 --> 00:06:37,540
Then let's go.

132
00:06:37,582 --> 00:06:39,540
I'm sorry, guys. I have
to handle this.

133
00:06:39,582 --> 00:06:43,248
And, Rob, feel free to drop my name in the interview.

134
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,997
I can't believe your pre-pub
neighbor sells homework to teachers.

135
00:06:47,998 --> 00:06:49,456
Yeah, and how is he so confident?

136
00:06:49,457 --> 00:06:52,247
He has one eyebrow and it's thicker
than Sam Elliott's mustache.

137
00:06:52,248 --> 00:06:53,873
Aw, he can't help the
eyebrow. He's Armenian.

138
00:06:53,915 --> 00:06:58,039
Poor kid? No, you should mow that thing.
It's embarrassing.

139
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,081
Says the guy who has been
not-so-subtly adjusting his cup.

140
00:07:02,082 --> 00:07:03,039
It's an athletic supporter.

141
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:06,997
It rides up sometimes.
In his defense, Gabrielle, a little discomfort is far better

142
00:07:06,998 --> 00:07:09,456
than getting kicked in he balls every day for a semester.

143
00:07:09,457 --> 00:07:12,789
That happened in the 9th
grade. It hasn't happened since.

144
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,622
It's not something one just forgets, Gabrielle.

145
00:07:14,623 --> 00:07:17,331
The 9th grade was my ballocaust.

146
00:07:17,332 --> 00:07:20,748
Never again.

147
00:07:22,915 --> 00:07:24,456
I got beer for tonight.
You excited?

148
00:07:24,457 --> 00:07:25,540
Oh, sweet. How?

149
00:07:25,582 --> 00:07:27,622
Just threw it in the cart at the shop 'n save.

150
00:07:27,624 --> 00:07:32,247
My mom thought my dad put it in and my dad
thought he put it in, so it worked out perfectly.

151
00:07:32,248 --> 00:07:35,373
Hey, so, it is your last chance to change your bet,

152
00:07:35,415 --> 00:07:36,539
unless you really think that

153
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,122
Mona Panchal will take it all.

154
00:07:38,123 --> 00:07:39,372
Um, some stats --

155
00:07:39,373 --> 00:07:40,247
all right.

156
00:07:40,248 --> 00:07:41,664
She is a 13-year-old

157
00:07:41,665 --> 00:07:44,997
up-and-comer from Kansas via Mumbai with a nervous twitch.

158
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:48,206
She placed 12th 2 years ago, 5th last year.
This is her year.

159
00:07:48,207 --> 00:07:51,039
Also, it is too late to change your bets
because the first round has started.

160
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,164
I'm just really excited for
Pongsaklek Wonjongkam to win at the UNCH

161
00:07:54,915 --> 00:07:57,081
Right. Is Pongsaklek
a boy or a girl?

162
00:07:57,082 --> 00:07:57,831
Yeah, I have no idea.

163
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:02,789
Exactly. But if it can spell its own name,
it can spell anything.

164
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,039
So, I was thinking we could drink every time somebody asks

165
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,706
for alternate pronunciations.

166
00:08:07,707 --> 00:08:12,122
Or -- or every time someone asks for alternate
pronunciations, we could cut ourselves.

167
00:08:12,123 --> 00:08:16,456
Yeah, sure.

168
00:08:16,457 --> 00:08:20,206
Yo, Rob! Y--

169
00:08:20,207 --> 00:08:22,122
hey! Are you kidding me?

170
00:08:22,123 --> 00:08:23,372
You're volleyball players.

171
00:08:23,373 --> 00:08:26,497
You don't get to pick on people.

172
00:08:26,498 --> 00:08:28,707
Set me.

173
00:08:28,748 --> 00:08:29,997
No!

174
00:08:29,998 --> 00:08:31,540
Ooh! Damn.

175
00:08:36,373 --> 00:08:37,873
It's piss.

176
00:08:37,915 --> 00:08:41,122
Those assholes pissed on me.

177
00:08:41,124 --> 00:08:44,039
Okay. Well, that'll dry by the interview.

178
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,581
Yeah, but he smells like a urinal cake.

179
00:08:45,582 --> 00:08:48,039
I do. I do smell like
a urinal cake.

180
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,456
Okay, guys, I have my test
next period. I got to go. Um...

181
00:08:51,457 --> 00:08:53,540
Stanley, go to the lost and found,
get Rob a new pair of pants.

182
00:08:53,582 --> 00:08:56,081
I won't let you down, buddy. Watch out! Pants emergency!

183
00:08:56,082 --> 00:08:57,873
Stay calm.

184
00:08:57,915 --> 00:08:59,497
All right? Take a deep breath.

185
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:01,707
Keep the recruiter's face away from your junk.

186
00:09:02,665 --> 00:09:04,039
And it's gonna be great.

187
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,997
Okay?

188
00:09:04,998 --> 00:09:06,372
Thanks, Gabs.

189
00:09:06,373 --> 00:09:07,622
Just text me with bee updates, okay?

190
00:09:07,623 --> 00:09:08,707
I will.

191
00:09:15,998 --> 00:09:17,122
Okay, these aren't ideal,

192
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:19,957
but they didn't have a lot to choose from.

193
00:09:23,165 --> 00:09:24,707
Are these even men's pants?

194
00:09:24,748 --> 00:09:26,372
Try 'em on. Maybe you'll
look fabulous.

195
00:09:26,373 --> 00:09:27,664
I feel like I'm gonna be sick.

196
00:09:27,665 --> 00:09:30,206
Hey, you know I have a test next period, right?

197
00:09:30,207 --> 00:09:31,747
Shh.

198
00:09:31,748 --> 00:09:34,956
Are all the people you
tutor this self-absorbed?

199
00:09:34,957 --> 00:09:37,372
Hey, Artie. Can you
help this student, please?

200
00:09:37,373 --> 00:09:38,622
Rob's falling apart.

201
00:09:38,623 --> 00:09:41,164
I know you have a learning
disability, Stanley, but can you

202
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:43,997
grasp the fact that I'm already working with someone?

203
00:09:43,998 --> 00:09:46,540
How many people know about your
arrangement with Mr. Hughes?

204
00:09:46,582 --> 00:09:48,039
And I'm presuming there are others.

205
00:09:49,498 --> 00:09:51,622
Don't shout that witch language at me!

206
00:09:51,623 --> 00:09:54,039
I'll burn you at the stake.

207
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,372
Move.

208
00:09:55,373 --> 00:09:57,207
Go.

209
00:10:00,707 --> 00:10:04,039
I know what would help.
Okay, take a deep breath.

210
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,956
Okay. I am.

211
00:10:04,957 --> 00:10:07,664
Good. Now go to
the bathroom, hit a

212
00:10:07,665 --> 00:10:11,039
stall, and rub one out to that.

213
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,414
It's a scientific fact that your blood
pressure drops after you orgasm.

214
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:18,540
It's like your balls are shooting yoga through your veins.

215
00:10:18,582 --> 00:10:21,206
Oh, no. Is she coming
over here? Yep.

216
00:10:21,207 --> 00:10:25,247
She is. Shit. Please
stop talking now.

217
00:10:25,248 --> 00:10:26,872
Hi, Rob.

218
00:10:26,873 --> 00:10:29,664
Hey, Angela.

219
00:10:29,665 --> 00:10:30,873
Um, good morning.

220
00:10:30,915 --> 00:10:33,914
Excuse me, Angela. I have
to update my Wikipedia page.

221
00:10:33,915 --> 00:10:35,247
Okay.

222
00:10:35,248 --> 00:10:37,997
So, Rob, um, I know our tutoring
session isn't supposed to be

223
00:10:37,998 --> 00:10:40,664
until Thursday, but I was kind
of hoping we could schedule,

224
00:10:40,665 --> 00:10:43,456
like, an emergency session.

225
00:10:43,457 --> 00:10:45,081
Miss Marconi moved the test up.

226
00:10:45,082 --> 00:10:47,414
She's getting a mammogram tomorrow, so...

227
00:10:47,415 --> 00:10:48,707
Did you say mammogram?

228
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,331
Yeah, how'd you make it sound so hot?

229
00:10:51,332 --> 00:10:54,289
I was thinking that we could study tonight at my house.

230
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:58,372
Tonight? Um, actually,
I don't think I can.

231
00:10:58,373 --> 00:10:59,456
Oh, boo. Really?

232
00:10:59,457 --> 00:11:00,707
No. Not really.

233
00:11:00,748 --> 00:11:03,872
Well, yeah. Uh, it's just, um...

234
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:06,372
I kind of have plans I can't change, so...

235
00:11:06,373 --> 00:11:07,664
Do you?

236
00:11:07,665 --> 00:11:09,164
Yes. I do,

237
00:11:09,165 --> 00:11:11,289
have plans.

238
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:14,207
Maybe, uh, you can study with Arthur instead?

239
00:11:21,373 --> 00:11:23,497
Oh, you're serious?

240
00:11:23,498 --> 00:11:25,372
That's okay. I'll just --

241
00:11:25,373 --> 00:11:26,706
I'll just fail it.

242
00:11:26,707 --> 00:11:28,372
No, Angela, don't worry.

243
00:11:28,373 --> 00:11:31,956
Rob will reassess his schedule and
get back to you A.S.A.F'ing.P.

244
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:37,331
Thanks. By the way, Rob, that coat
makes you look so professorial.

245
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:49,914
She wants to fuck you.

246
00:11:49,915 --> 00:11:52,289
Her nickname is "after school special" for a reason.

247
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:55,289
Freshman year, she cured Mike Dolan's stutter.
I know.

248
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,206
Her pussy inspired
"the king's speech."

249
00:11:57,207 --> 00:11:59,247
I just can't just bail on Gabs, you know?

250
00:11:59,248 --> 00:12:01,707
I mean, we watch the spelling bee every year.
It's our thing.

251
00:12:01,748 --> 00:12:04,581
You've been borderline stalking
Angela as long as we've been friends.

252
00:12:04,582 --> 00:12:05,872
We've been friends since we were 5.

253
00:12:05,873 --> 00:12:05,873


254
00:12:05,874 --> 00:12:07,747
Not exactly.
You took time to grow on me.

255
00:12:07,748 --> 00:12:09,414
I didn't consider you a friend until 6 and a half.

256
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:12,039
Wait, seriously?
Look, Angela has sex with grown men.

257
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,831
She hasn't slept with a high-school
student since elementary school.

258
00:12:14,832 --> 00:12:16,372
She's making an exception for you.

259
00:12:16,373 --> 00:12:17,707
This is too much pressure for me today.

260
00:12:17,748 --> 00:12:18,956
Okay, well, let me ask you this.

261
00:12:18,957 --> 00:12:20,414
Has she ever invited you over to her house before?

262
00:12:20,415 --> 00:12:22,707
No, and stop, okay? Please.

263
00:12:22,748 --> 00:12:25,914
Because I am panicking, and
I cannot shit these gym shorts.

264
00:12:25,915 --> 00:12:28,414
Ew.
Did he really just say that?

265
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:31,622
The poem tells of a talking raven's mysterious visit to a

266
00:12:31,623 --> 00:12:36,539
distraught lover, tracing's he
man's slow fall into madness.

267
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,372
I'll start reading and then we'll go
around the room counterclockwise.

268
00:12:40,374 --> 00:12:44,997
Okay.
As I recite the poem, look for the repetition of the word

269
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:47,039
"nevermore."

270
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,956
"Once upon a midnight dreary,

271
00:12:48,957 --> 00:12:51,539
while I pondered weak and weary,

272
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,747
over many a quaint and curious

273
00:12:53,748 --> 00:12:55,414
volume of forgotten lore"...

274
00:12:55,415 --> 00:12:58,122
You know, I looked at last year's yearbook, and her tits

275
00:12:58,123 --> 00:12:59,956
were not that big.

276
00:12:59,957 --> 00:13:02,747
There has definitely been a cosmetic enhancement.

277
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,247
At least two of them.

278
00:13:04,248 --> 00:13:05,872
Definitely.

279
00:13:05,873 --> 00:13:09,706
When I die, I want to come back
as her top button, you know?

280
00:13:09,707 --> 00:13:11,039
Yeah.

281
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,289
Or a guy who's fucking her.

282
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,206
That'd be cool.

283
00:13:13,207 --> 00:13:16,581
That would be cool.

284
00:13:16,582 --> 00:13:18,206
Dude, come on.

285
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:21,456
I have something to add.

286
00:13:24,748 --> 00:13:27,747
I need Rob Crabbe to the main office.

287
00:13:27,748 --> 00:13:29,872
Rob.

288
00:13:38,832 --> 00:13:40,997
Is that supposed to be the Georgetown mascot?

289
00:13:40,998 --> 00:13:43,372
'Cause you know it's a bulldog.

290
00:13:43,373 --> 00:13:45,123
I can't draw bulldogs.

291
00:13:47,373 --> 00:13:49,206
..."the silken sad uncertain

292
00:13:49,207 --> 00:13:51,039
rustling of each purple curtain

293
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,707
filled me with fantastic terrors

294
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:56,372
never felt before."

295
00:13:56,373 --> 00:13:59,622
Didn't Stanley go to the lost and found?

296
00:13:59,623 --> 00:14:01,456
They only had Capri pants.

297
00:14:01,457 --> 00:14:03,706
Mm-hmm.

298
00:14:03,707 --> 00:14:04,789
Are you my escort?

299
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,706
At your service.

300
00:14:08,623 --> 00:14:09,747
Oh, I have bad news for you.

301
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:14,622
What? Pongsaklek Wonjongkam, who is
a boy, by the way, misspelled

302
00:14:14,623 --> 00:14:16,997
"endoradiosonde" in the second preliminary round.

303
00:14:16,998 --> 00:14:17,790
Are you serious?

304
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,039
Shit. I did not see
either of those coming.

305
00:14:24,623 --> 00:14:27,039
Well...

306
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,539
Here we are.

307
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,497
You're gonna nail
it. I know it.

308
00:14:30,498 --> 00:14:31,289
You think?

309
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,539
Yes.

310
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,497
I mean, who can resist those legs?

311
00:14:45,248 --> 00:14:46,289
Rob Crabbe?

312
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:50,206
Yes. Jack Roth, Georgetown admissions.
Good to meet you.

313
00:14:50,207 --> 00:14:52,414
Please take a seat.

314
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,914
Uh, before we begin, allow me

315
00:14:54,915 --> 00:14:57,664
to apologize for the shorts.

316
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:02,873
Some of my classmates thought
it might be amusing if uhh --

317
00:15:02,915 --> 00:15:04,956
bullies.

318
00:15:04,957 --> 00:15:06,789
What was their weapon of choice?

319
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:10,206
A piss-filled water gun.
Direct hit.

320
00:15:10,207 --> 00:15:12,081
Say no more. I'll pretend
they're pants.

321
00:15:13,623 --> 00:15:16,039
Look, everything I've read about you is great, so I'm

322
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,706
really here just to put a face with the name.

323
00:15:18,707 --> 00:15:22,165
Are those your notes?

324
00:15:22,873 --> 00:15:26,873
Give them to me.

325
00:15:26,915 --> 00:15:29,539
You don't need notes.

326
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,039
Just be yourself.

327
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,706
And it's okay if you don't know who that is yet.

328
00:15:33,707 --> 00:15:37,122
That's what college is for --
to figure out who you are.

329
00:15:37,123 --> 00:15:38,706
Right? Not what somebody else

330
00:15:38,707 --> 00:15:43,039
wants you to be, but who you...

331
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,247
Really...

332
00:15:45,248 --> 00:15:47,831
Are.

333
00:15:47,832 --> 00:15:49,873
Just answer the questions honestly.

334
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:51,206
You're gonna do fine, all right?

335
00:15:51,207 --> 00:15:52,872
Okay.

336
00:15:52,873 --> 00:15:56,456
I see that your parents both

337
00:15:56,457 --> 00:15:58,539
graduated from Georgetown.

338
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,956
Yeah. Both my mom and dad.

339
00:16:00,957 --> 00:16:02,706
They met there, actually.

340
00:16:02,707 --> 00:16:04,622
Uh, some kids grow up hearing

341
00:16:04,623 --> 00:16:06,997
about Oz or wonderland.

342
00:16:06,998 --> 00:16:08,706
All my fairy tales took place in

343
00:16:08,707 --> 00:16:10,622
the mythical land of Georgetown.

344
00:16:20,998 --> 00:16:21,747
I'm sorry.

345
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,539
I met my wife...

346
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,581
At Georgetown, too.

347
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,414
But then...

348
00:16:33,415 --> 00:16:35,123
Lupus.

349
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,789
I'm sorry.

350
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:45,039
It feels like it happened yesterday.
It was 10 months ago.

351
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,372
I'm just having a moment, okay?

352
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:48,081
Yeah, no.

353
00:16:48,082 --> 00:16:49,247
Please, take your time.

354
00:16:49,248 --> 00:16:50,581
No, no, no.
Let's do this.

355
00:16:50,582 --> 00:16:51,372
Let's do this.

356
00:17:01,582 --> 00:17:04,997
You know who the biggest bully

357
00:17:04,998 --> 00:17:07,040
is?

358
00:17:07,373 --> 00:17:08,872
Lupus?

359
00:17:08,873 --> 00:17:09,997
No!

360
00:17:09,998 --> 00:17:11,997
It's life!

361
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:13,872
Life is the biggest bully of them all.

362
00:17:13,873 --> 00:17:15,122
They'll shoot you with a

363
00:17:15,123 --> 00:17:17,706
piss-filled water pistol
again and again and again.

364
00:17:17,707 --> 00:17:20,747
You got to just get up, carry on.

365
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,372
Smell like piss.

366
00:17:23,373 --> 00:17:25,206
Life is the biggest fucking

367
00:17:25,207 --> 00:17:26,540
bully of them all.

368
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,372
I am sorry.

369
00:17:31,873 --> 00:17:33,372
Whoa!

370
00:17:33,373 --> 00:17:34,289
Detour.

371
00:17:35,832 --> 00:17:37,622
Oh, look it here.

372
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:40,206
It says that you were, uh, part

373
00:17:40,207 --> 00:17:42,164
of the student-to-student

374
00:17:42,165 --> 00:17:44,915
tutoring initiative.

375
00:17:48,207 --> 00:17:50,707
Mr. Roth?

376
00:17:51,832 --> 00:17:55,372
My wife was my tutor.

377
00:17:55,373 --> 00:17:56,706
That is how we met.

378
00:17:56,707 --> 00:17:57,706
Oh, God.

379
00:17:57,707 --> 00:18:00,372
That's how we met.

380
00:18:00,373 --> 00:18:03,039
And now she's gone.

381
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,831
Um...

382
00:18:06,832 --> 00:18:10,290
I have my dad's headband, so...

383
00:18:11,748 --> 00:18:12,706
Thank you.

384
00:18:14,957 --> 00:18:16,040
Oh.

385
00:18:24,707 --> 00:18:26,164
How'd it go?

386
00:18:26,165 --> 00:18:27,997
He cried.

387
00:18:27,998 --> 00:18:29,581
Somehow I reminded him of the

388
00:18:29,582 --> 00:18:33,539
greatest loss of his life.

389
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,956
There goes Georgetown.

390
00:18:34,957 --> 00:18:36,456
It's not the end of the world.

391
00:18:36,457 --> 00:18:38,289
It's just your dad talking.
There are other schools.

392
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,997
Imagine for one second that
you had any goals whatsoever,

393
00:18:40,998 --> 00:18:42,706
and then imagine if they didn't happen.

394
00:18:42,707 --> 00:18:45,122
This is exactly why I don't have goals.

395
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:47,081
Look, you can still get into Georgetown.

396
00:18:47,082 --> 00:18:48,789
And if you can't, focus on one

397
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,206
thing you can still get into --

398
00:18:50,207 --> 00:18:51,789
Angela.

399
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,622
You're insane.

400
00:18:52,623 --> 00:18:54,664
She doesn't want to --

401
00:18:54,665 --> 00:18:57,747
you could become a beautiful non-virgin butterfly.

402
00:18:57,748 --> 00:19:00,498
Let Angela's crotch be your cocoon.

403
00:19:03,248 --> 00:19:04,706
Hey. Angela.

404
00:19:04,707 --> 00:19:05,997
Rob.

405
00:19:05,998 --> 00:19:07,122
Nice shorts.

406
00:19:07,123 --> 00:19:08,331
Uh, thanks.

407
00:19:08,332 --> 00:19:09,706
Uh, long story.

408
00:19:09,707 --> 00:19:11,206
But, um...

409
00:19:11,207 --> 00:19:12,622
I can tutor you tonight.

410
00:19:12,623 --> 00:19:13,372
Really?

411
00:19:13,373 --> 00:19:14,622
Yeah.

412
00:19:14,623 --> 00:19:16,039
Oh, Rob you're such a life saver.

413
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,164
Oh, I can help you out with your test, but Miss Marconi is

414
00:19:19,165 --> 00:19:22,665
on her own with her... Mammogram.

415
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,414
Hey. I've been looking
all over for you.

416
00:19:27,415 --> 00:19:31,039
Hey, how was your, uh...

417
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,747
Really?

418
00:19:31,748 --> 00:19:32,956
Uh, yeah.

419
00:19:32,957 --> 00:19:34,289
I, um...

420
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,622
I pulled a Wonjongkam.

421
00:19:35,623 --> 00:19:37,289
No. What happened.

422
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,706
I'd rather not relive it.

423
00:19:40,207 --> 00:19:42,664
Hey, so, listen, um...

424
00:19:42,665 --> 00:19:45,331
I don't think I can make it tonight.

425
00:19:45,332 --> 00:19:47,539
I, uh, I'm just not feeling up to it.

426
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,372
You sure? Might cheer you up.

427
00:19:49,373 --> 00:19:52,372
Yeah, you know, another time.

428
00:19:52,373 --> 00:19:53,540
Um...

429
00:19:54,248 --> 00:19:55,539
It's just my future's in doubt.

430
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,623
Yeah. Yeah, no, that's okay.

431
00:20:02,748 --> 00:20:04,206
I don't know why you feel so bad.

432
00:20:04,207 --> 00:20:06,456
Because I just lied to Gabs.

433
00:20:06,457 --> 00:20:07,581
I feel awful.

434
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:09,122
Good. We can use that.

435
00:20:09,123 --> 00:20:10,081
What?

436
00:20:10,082 --> 00:20:11,039
Well, guilt is a blessing.

437
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,664
It'll make you last longer.

438
00:20:12,665 --> 00:20:13,622
You can only go 4 minutes

439
00:20:13,623 --> 00:20:14,997
when it's just you and the tissues.

440
00:20:14,998 --> 00:20:17,622
Yeah, and I'm feeling plenty of guilt then, too.

441
00:20:17,623 --> 00:20:20,539
Well, we'll need something stronger.

442
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:23,039
Remember when I accidentally exposed my baldy?

443
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,247
Ugh. Yeah.

444
00:20:24,248 --> 00:20:26,122
It looked like my grandpa's elbow.

445
00:20:26,123 --> 00:20:27,789
Yeah, use that.

446
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,289
That'll ruin things for a little while.

447
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:31,082
That's good.

448
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,997
You know what you should do?

449
00:20:34,998 --> 00:20:37,247
Buy the magnums, too.

450
00:20:37,248 --> 00:20:40,539
Then use the regular-sized
condom, but leave behind the

451
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,831
Magnum wrapper.

452
00:20:41,832 --> 00:20:43,164
What's that gonna do?

453
00:20:43,165 --> 00:20:46,956
Besides make her feel like she has a giant vagina.

454
00:20:46,957 --> 00:20:49,206
Um, I'll have the trojan ecstasy

455
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:51,290
ultra-ribbed, please.

456
00:20:55,998 --> 00:20:58,539
<i> Whoo, whoo, whoo-ooh <i>

pussy?

470
00:21:43,665 --> 00:21:44,956
Excuse me?

471
00:21:44,957 --> 00:21:47,997
Are you here for pussy?

472
00:21:47,998 --> 00:21:49,997
I'm Angela's tutor.

473
00:21:49,998 --> 00:21:51,539
Is she home?

474
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,873
I don't know.

475
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,039
Mind if I check?

476
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,498
Do as you wish.

477
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,372
Hey.

478
00:22:01,373 --> 00:22:02,456
Hey.

479
00:22:02,457 --> 00:22:04,872
Uzi, you know you can smoke inside.

480
00:22:04,873 --> 00:22:07,372
Uh, no thank you.

481
00:22:07,373 --> 00:22:09,039
Uzi's from Israel.
He's staying with us

482
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,206
for the rest of the school year, so...

483
00:22:11,207 --> 00:22:12,122
Cool.

484
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:15,039
When it's this quiet back home...

485
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,082
A cafe explodes.

486
00:22:20,748 --> 00:22:21,497
Come on in.

487
00:22:21,498 --> 00:22:23,415
Okay.

488
00:22:25,998 --> 00:22:27,998
Ka-boom.

489
00:22:34,665 --> 00:22:36,372
Uh... So...

490
00:22:36,373 --> 00:22:38,706
Quadratic equations.

491
00:22:38,707 --> 00:22:40,372
Believe me, it is a lot more

492
00:22:40,373 --> 00:22:42,372
exciting than it sounds.

493
00:22:42,373 --> 00:22:44,247
What are you doing?

494
00:22:44,248 --> 00:22:45,914
Sit on the bed.

495
00:22:45,915 --> 00:22:46,956
Oh, yeah.

496
00:22:46,957 --> 00:22:48,997
Uh, right.

497
00:22:48,998 --> 00:22:51,331
Of course.

498
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,206
So, would you like some wine?

499
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,497
It's white zinfandel.

500
00:22:56,498 --> 00:22:58,039
It's my mom's favorite.

501
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,331
It's absolutely delish.

502
00:22:59,332 --> 00:23:00,456
No thanks.

503
00:23:00,457 --> 00:23:03,206
Math pairs better with a robust red.

504
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,581
Is your mom home?

505
00:23:06,582 --> 00:23:08,372
No, she works at night.

506
00:23:08,373 --> 00:23:10,456
It's just me and uzi.

507
00:23:13,165 --> 00:23:13,997
Oh, my God!

508
00:23:13,998 --> 00:23:15,247
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry!

509
00:23:15,248 --> 00:23:16,664
Don't worry about it.

510
00:23:22,373 --> 00:23:24,039
So, uh...

511
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,039
What -- what exactly is your

512
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,706
test on tomorrow?

513
00:23:29,707 --> 00:23:31,289
Can I confess something to you?

514
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:32,414
You don't have a dead wife or

515
00:23:32,415 --> 00:23:33,372
anything, do you?

516
00:23:33,373 --> 00:23:35,706
'Cause I can't take that again today.

517
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:38,414
No.

518
00:23:38,415 --> 00:23:40,872
I don't really have a test tomorrow.

519
00:23:40,873 --> 00:23:41,872
You don't?

520
00:23:41,873 --> 00:23:43,331
No

521
00:23:43,332 --> 00:23:46,497
I just really like studying with you.

522
00:23:46,498 --> 00:23:48,331
I really like studying with you, too.

523
00:23:48,332 --> 00:23:49,539
Your grades are really improving.

524
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:53,872
Yeah. The studying sessions are, like, the highlight of my week.

525
00:23:53,873 --> 00:23:55,039
They are?

526
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,206
Yeah.

527
00:23:57,207 --> 00:23:58,456
When I'm with you, I don't know.

528
00:23:58,457 --> 00:24:01,122
You don't treat me like everyone else.

529
00:24:01,123 --> 00:24:03,539
I just feel... I don't know.

530
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,664
Safe.

531
00:24:05,665 --> 00:24:10,207
I was captain of the safety patrol team in 8th grade.

532
00:24:19,123 --> 00:24:19,997
Wait.

533
00:24:19,998 --> 00:24:22,497
Maybe we should --

534
00:24:22,498 --> 00:24:25,539
oh, that -- that is nice.

535
00:24:31,415 --> 00:24:33,039
Just... Throw the sheets in

536
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,123
the laundry, hon.

537
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,998
What the f--

538
00:24:49,248 --> 00:24:49,997
It's okay.

539
00:24:49,998 --> 00:24:51,539
She's in the laundry room.

540
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,081
Sit down.

541
00:24:54,957 --> 00:24:57,790
We both know how important today's interview is.

542
00:25:00,998 --> 00:25:02,331
Rob?

543
00:25:02,332 --> 00:25:05,539
The interview is today?

544
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:09,039
Don't "f" with me, Robert.

545
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,414
When you were benched in little

546
00:25:10,415 --> 00:25:14,456
league and your team played with
8 players, I said nothing.

547
00:25:14,457 --> 00:25:18,289
When you were bullied by Sally Levinson, I said nothing.

548
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:23,539
When you lost the class presidency
to a raccoon, huh, I said nothing.

549
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:28,498
But this interview is far too important
for me to sit idly by and say nothing.

550
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,414
I want you to wear this during the interview.

551
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:40,040
The headband. This is my old headband from
when I rowed crew at Georgetown.

552
00:25:43,832 --> 00:25:46,997
Today's the day you make me proud.

553
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,664
It would save me time if I would

554
00:25:49,665 --> 00:25:51,164
just put down newspaper on

555
00:25:51,165 --> 00:25:54,707
his... Bed.

556
00:26:00,207 --> 00:26:01,664
Rob!

557
00:26:01,665 --> 00:26:03,414
Yo, Rob!

558
00:26:03,415 --> 00:26:05,207
Ah!

559
00:26:11,373 --> 00:26:14,914
So, I'm about to blow my
load when she says, "wait."

560
00:26:14,915 --> 00:26:17,956
She then stands up, gets dressed, and leaves.

561
00:26:17,957 --> 00:26:20,039
But before she goes, she turns to me

562
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,206
and says, "okay. Come now."

563
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:26,707
And boom. I came.

564
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,123
What the fuck are you doing?

565
00:26:40,915 --> 00:26:44,706
Why are you dressed like Ellen Degeneres?

566
00:26:49,623 --> 00:26:52,122
No, he sent me this
fucked-up YouTube clip.

567
00:26:52,123 --> 00:26:53,414
Some MMA guy got punched in the

568
00:26:53,415 --> 00:26:56,206
nuts so hard he shit himself and came.

569
00:26:56,207 --> 00:26:58,497
Hey, you pissed at me or something?

570
00:26:58,499 --> 00:27:02,081
What? No. I'm just... Really out of it.

571
00:27:02,082 --> 00:27:03,747
I don't think I slept so good.

572
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:05,706
I was having a crazy dream.

573
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,706
And a good morning to you both.

574
00:27:07,707 --> 00:27:10,247
Hey, Gabs. Arthur.

575
00:27:10,248 --> 00:27:11,039
What time are you flying out, Artie?

576
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:15,539
Funny, Stanley. Too bad the special Olympics
doesn't have a comedy competition.

577
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,039
So, Rob, Gabrielle told me your

578
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:22,289
Georgetown interview is today?

579
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:25,289
Does anyone know the warning signs of a stroke?

580
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,164
Good morning.

581
00:27:26,165 --> 00:27:27,456
Hi, Mr. Hughes.

582
00:27:27,457 --> 00:27:29,872
Arthur, I thought you were gonna be here early.

583
00:27:29,873 --> 00:27:32,332
Excuse me for a second.

584
00:27:33,915 --> 00:27:35,997
You know, I kind of feel bad for him.

585
00:27:35,999 --> 00:27:38,914
Why?
Probably because he has one eyebrow.

586
00:27:38,915 --> 00:27:39,664
And it's thicker than...

587
00:27:39,665 --> 00:27:41,539
Sam Elliott's mustache.

588
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:45,331
So, I was thinking every time they ask for alternate

589
00:27:45,332 --> 00:27:46,956
pronunciations, we could drink.

590
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:52,956
Rob! Yo, Rob!

591
00:27:52,957 --> 00:27:54,497
Hey!

592
00:27:54,498 --> 00:27:55,331
Are you kidding me?

593
00:27:55,332 --> 00:27:56,414
You're volleyball players.

594
00:27:56,415 --> 00:27:57,706
You don't get to pick on people.

595
00:27:57,707 --> 00:27:58,664
Set me.

596
00:27:58,665 --> 00:27:59,664
Oh!

597
00:27:59,665 --> 00:28:01,247
Ooh! Damn!

598
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,539
It's piss.

599
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,247
Okay, um...

600
00:28:07,248 --> 00:28:09,247
Well, that'll dry by the interview, right?

601
00:28:09,248 --> 00:28:11,039
Yeah, but he smells like a urinal cake.

602
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,081
I have my test next period, so I got to go.

603
00:28:13,082 --> 00:28:14,206
Um...

604
00:28:14,207 --> 00:28:15,581
Stanley, go to
the lost and found --

605
00:28:15,582 --> 00:28:16,539
no, it's fine.

606
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,747
I'll just wear the shorts in my

607
00:28:17,748 --> 00:28:18,789
gym locker.

608
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:21,581
Really? You sure?

609
00:28:21,582 --> 00:28:22,872
Stay calm.

610
00:28:22,873 --> 00:28:24,122
Take a deep breath.

611
00:28:24,123 --> 00:28:26,207
No, seriously. I'm good.

612
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,164
This was the dream.

613
00:28:37,707 --> 00:28:39,206
You dreamed about today?

614
00:28:39,207 --> 00:28:40,414
Yeah.

615
00:28:40,415 --> 00:28:42,539
Lisa's telling you to come.

616
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,956
The piss gun.

617
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:47,372
And Angela Yearwood wants to

618
00:28:47,373 --> 00:28:49,081
have sex with me.

619
00:28:49,082 --> 00:28:49,872
Bullshit.

620
00:28:49,873 --> 00:28:53,247
Hey. I have a test next period.

621
00:28:53,248 --> 00:28:55,414
Are all the people you
tutor this self-absorbed?

622
00:28:55,415 --> 00:28:56,747
Hi, Rob.

623
00:28:56,748 --> 00:28:58,997
So, I know our tutoring session
wasn't supposed to be until

624
00:28:58,998 --> 00:29:00,622
Thursday, but I was kind of,

625
00:29:00,623 --> 00:29:03,039
like, hoping that we could schedule an emergency session.

626
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,206
Miss Marconi moved the test up.

627
00:29:05,207 --> 00:29:07,039
She's getting a mammogram tomorrow.

628
00:29:11,373 --> 00:29:12,956
Mammogram.

629
00:29:15,415 --> 00:29:17,747
How could you even focus on your interview right now?

630
00:29:17,748 --> 00:29:18,706
In the dream, I bombed it.

631
00:29:18,708 --> 00:29:22,664
Who cares?
Angela will make everything in the world right again.

632
00:29:25,748 --> 00:29:28,706
I need Rob Crabbe to the main office.

633
00:29:28,708 --> 00:29:33,040
Rob.
You know, I bombed the Angela thing, too.

634
00:29:40,498 --> 00:29:41,706
That's right.

635
00:29:41,707 --> 00:29:43,497
What?

636
00:29:43,498 --> 00:29:47,457
Nothing.

637
00:29:48,082 --> 00:29:50,039
Are you ready?

638
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,289
Do I look ready?

639
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,372
The outfit weirdly works for you.

640
00:29:53,373 --> 00:29:55,289
No, it doesn't.

641
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:57,956
Nope. Not at all.

642
00:29:57,957 --> 00:29:59,372
Oh, I have bad news for you.

643
00:29:59,373 --> 00:30:03,831
Yeah, Pongsaklek Wonjongkam
misspelled "endoradiosonde."

644
00:30:03,832 --> 00:30:06,164
My wife was my tutor. That's how we met.

645
00:30:06,165 --> 00:30:07,997
Oh, God. Jesus.

646
00:30:09,457 --> 00:30:11,998
She's gone.

647
00:30:13,957 --> 00:30:17,414
So?

648
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:20,122
Don't shut me out!

649
00:30:20,123 --> 00:30:21,331
Hey, Rob!

650
00:30:22,707 --> 00:30:23,414
Are you okay?

651
00:30:23,416 --> 00:30:27,372
Yeah. Why?
I just thought you'd be more excited to come over tonight.

652
00:30:27,374 --> 00:30:29,372
That's all.
You know, if you have other plans.

653
00:30:29,374 --> 00:30:32,664
You know what? I can tutor you tonight, so...

654
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:34,706
You're a life saver!

655
00:30:45,748 --> 00:30:48,831
Um... Help me? I'm sick.

656
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,706
What's wrong?

657
00:30:49,707 --> 00:30:51,039
I have no idea.

658
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:55,706
I'm having deja vu or, like, a
psychotic episode, and I really

659
00:30:55,707 --> 00:30:58,206
need your help because I'm falling apart.

660
00:30:58,207 --> 00:30:59,414
Okay.

661
00:30:59,415 --> 00:31:01,997
Put this under your tongue.

662
00:31:03,998 --> 00:31:06,415
That's your timer, Neal.

663
00:31:10,957 --> 00:31:12,164
No fever, Neal.

664
00:31:12,165 --> 00:31:14,456
You're not sick, honey.

665
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:16,123
You can go back to class.

666
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,039
Yeah, you know what?
I'll just figure it out.

667
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,539
Feel better, Neal.

668
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:31,372
There's never a bad time to get
an std from Angela Yearwood.

669
00:31:31,373 --> 00:31:34,706
Even if she gave you a fatal one, your
doctor would still high-five you.

670
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:39,206
Shit. I never canceled
with Gabs.

671
00:31:39,207 --> 00:31:39,997
Who cares?

672
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:41,539
Angela's about to deflower you.

673
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:44,207
Please smile.

674
00:31:45,332 --> 00:31:50,206
Could I have the trojan
ecstasy ultra-ribbed, please?

675
00:31:50,207 --> 00:31:54,414
<i> Whoo, whoo, whoo-ooh-ooh <i>

676
00:31:54,415 --> 00:31:57,081
<i> I love you <i>

677
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:58,497
<i> you do, too <i>

678
00:31:58,498 --> 00:32:00,081
oh, shit. This is where -- aah!

679
00:32:03,748 --> 00:32:06,414
Are you here for pussy?

680
00:32:06,415 --> 00:32:07,206
Hey.

681
00:32:11,248 --> 00:32:15,622
Can I confess something to you?

682
00:32:15,623 --> 00:32:18,081
I don't really have a test tomorrow.

683
00:32:18,082 --> 00:32:19,957
I know.

684
00:32:27,082 --> 00:32:28,081
Oh, no.

685
00:32:36,457 --> 00:32:38,081
Just... Throw the sheets in

686
00:32:38,082 --> 00:32:40,039
the LA--

687
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,039
today's the day you make me proud.

688
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,539
Rob! Ah!

689
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,122
She's getting a mammogram tomorrow.

690
00:32:47,124 --> 00:32:49,539
Nevermore. I have some more bad news for you.

691
00:32:56,248 --> 00:32:58,207
Not this time.

692
00:33:06,498 --> 00:33:07,289
Pussy?

693
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:09,706
Can I confess something to you?

694
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:19,956
Just... Throw the sheets
in the laundry, hon.

695
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:23,622
What the fuck is happening?!

696
00:33:23,623 --> 00:33:25,247
Is everything okay?

697
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,456
Yeah! Yeah.

698
00:33:27,457 --> 00:33:30,414
I'll just -- I'll throw
the sheets in the laundry.

699
00:33:37,373 --> 00:33:38,706
Do you want this to end?

700
00:33:38,707 --> 00:33:42,372
'Cause I think you're
getting a pretty good deal here.

701
00:33:42,373 --> 00:33:45,289
We're having sex. The least you
can do is hold my hand in school.

702
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:49,497
Look, the whole reason that this works is because I get to

703
00:33:49,498 --> 00:33:51,997
practice for when I meet the right guy in college, okay?

704
00:33:51,998 --> 00:33:54,456
'Cause as far as anyone who really matters is concerned,

705
00:33:54,457 --> 00:33:56,872
you don't exist.

706
00:33:58,457 --> 00:34:00,497
The hell are you doing here?

707
00:34:00,498 --> 00:34:02,456
I have something I need to tell you.

708
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,206
There is only one explanation.

709
00:34:04,207 --> 00:34:06,706
Your virginity is driving you insane.

710
00:34:06,707 --> 00:34:09,539
It's like one of those videos we saw
in Ms. Depanorizzi's health class.

711
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,706
You know, how little

712
00:34:10,707 --> 00:34:12,747
Timmy went berserk because he masturbated too much.

713
00:34:12,748 --> 00:34:18,039
No, I know. It's just --
I swear this all feels too real.

714
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,956
Way too real.

715
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:21,206
Sounds like a delusional disorder.

716
00:34:21,207 --> 00:34:22,956
Unlike hallucinations, your

717
00:34:22,957 --> 00:34:26,039
actual belief in these events is clearly pathological.

718
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,039
An antipsychotic will help

719
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,247
reduce your dopamine levels.

720
00:34:28,248 --> 00:34:30,040
You'll be fine.

721
00:34:31,998 --> 00:34:33,081
My dad's a psychiatrist.

722
00:34:33,082 --> 00:34:34,414
I know what will help.

723
00:34:34,415 --> 00:34:36,039
What?

724
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:36,747
A threesome.

725
00:34:36,748 --> 00:34:37,581
With me?

726
00:34:37,582 --> 00:34:38,539
Yeah. With you.

727
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,289
It's a win-win-win.

728
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:44,206
Look, you get some pre-college practice, Rob
has sex and is no longer driven mad by his

729
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:48,372
virginal status, and I bust a
nut before 8:00 in the morning.

730
00:34:48,373 --> 00:34:49,539
What do you say?

731
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:53,206
Yeah, but what actually happens in a threesome?

732
00:34:53,207 --> 00:34:54,581
Does that mean that you and I --

733
00:34:54,582 --> 00:34:57,122
mnh-mnh, Rob, you and
I will not be having sex.

734
00:34:57,123 --> 00:34:59,331
We'd be boning Lisa.

735
00:34:59,332 --> 00:35:00,539
At the same time?

736
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,372
It all depends.

737
00:35:01,373 --> 00:35:02,664
There are different methods.

738
00:35:02,665 --> 00:35:04,622
You know, we could take turns --

739
00:35:04,623 --> 00:35:05,664
okay.

740
00:35:05,665 --> 00:35:06,956
Okay.
Do you really think that I would

741
00:35:06,957 --> 00:35:09,789
have a threesome with the two of you?

742
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:10,456
Maybe.

743
00:35:10,457 --> 00:35:11,164
Okay, look.

744
00:35:11,165 --> 00:35:13,039
Threesomes are... Special.

745
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,539
They're specifically reserved

746
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:17,289
for when I find the man that I'm going to marry.

747
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:19,581
And then a friend of his choice, of course.

748
00:35:19,582 --> 00:35:24,456
You know, that's how you make marriages work.

749
00:35:24,457 --> 00:35:27,664
Oh, and, Stanley, you can come now.

750
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,206
You too, Rob.

751
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:40,956
Just... Throw the sheets in

752
00:35:40,957 --> 00:35:43,040
the laundry, hon.

753
00:35:47,998 --> 00:35:50,456
He's a young man!

754
00:35:50,457 --> 00:35:52,914
Are you kidding me with this?!

755
00:35:52,915 --> 00:35:55,581
It's like he's regressing right before our eyes!

756
00:35:55,582 --> 00:35:56,706
He has a big day, probably

757
00:35:56,707 --> 00:35:58,247
just needed to relieve some tension.

758
00:35:58,248 --> 00:36:00,581
That was a lot of tension!

759
00:36:00,582 --> 00:36:02,997
Our son is turning into this pervert!

760
00:36:02,998 --> 00:36:04,997
When I was that age, I could fill a bucket.

761
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:07,747
Yeah? Well, sweetie,
you can still fill a bucket.

762
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:09,372
It's just a little squirt.

763
00:36:09,373 --> 00:36:11,831
A little squirt?!

764
00:36:11,832 --> 00:36:14,997
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

765
00:36:14,998 --> 00:36:17,539
So, I went to Angela's house

766
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:20,997
one, two, three times, and then

767
00:36:20,998 --> 00:36:23,331
I went and saw Stanley and Lisa.

768
00:36:23,332 --> 00:36:25,747
And then we almost had a threesome.

769
00:36:25,748 --> 00:36:27,582
And then...

770
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:42,164
Is that a 48-inch --

771
00:36:42,165 --> 00:36:44,040
sure is.

772
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,248
I'm gonna do my own laundry from now on.

773
00:36:59,707 --> 00:37:01,206
Hey!

774
00:37:01,207 --> 00:37:02,497
Hey!

775
00:37:02,498 --> 00:37:03,706
Gabs!

776
00:37:03,707 --> 00:37:05,414
Gabrielle, stop!

777
00:37:05,415 --> 00:37:06,998
Gabrielle!

778
00:37:09,457 --> 00:37:11,872
Rob? Are you okay?
You look insane.

779
00:37:11,873 --> 00:37:12,706
Did you see Gabrielle?

780
00:37:12,707 --> 00:37:14,331
Yeah. She went inside.

781
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:16,497
Dude, I called your phone like a thousand times.

782
00:37:16,498 --> 00:37:18,206
The most amazing thing happened to me this morning.

783
00:37:18,207 --> 00:37:21,747
I know. Lisa's totally become
a master at jizzekinesis!

784
00:37:21,748 --> 00:37:24,082
Jizzekinesis!

785
00:37:25,665 --> 00:37:27,415
Gabs!

786
00:37:28,457 --> 00:37:29,706
Gabs! Hey!

787
00:37:29,707 --> 00:37:31,039
Gabs!

788
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,706
That's what you're wearing to your interview?

789
00:37:32,707 --> 00:37:33,539
Huh?

790
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,997
Oh, no, no, no, no.

791
00:37:34,998 --> 00:37:36,206
Hey, um, I need to talk to you.

792
00:37:36,207 --> 00:37:37,039
It's really important.

793
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,872
Sure. Are you okay?

794
00:37:37,873 --> 00:37:38,581
Not really.

795
00:37:38,582 --> 00:37:41,289
Let's go somewhere maybe and --

796
00:37:42,623 --> 00:37:43,372
Oh, yeah!

797
00:37:43,373 --> 00:37:44,497
You think that's funny?!

798
00:37:44,498 --> 00:37:45,747
You think that's funny?!

799
00:37:45,748 --> 00:37:47,039
Whoa!

800
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,873
Chill out!

801
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,872
That wasn't yours to touch.

802
00:37:53,873 --> 00:37:54,997
Rob, I think we should go now.

803
00:37:54,998 --> 00:37:57,497
Yeah, you should really listen to your girlfriend.

804
00:37:57,498 --> 00:37:59,372
You guys are taller and

805
00:37:59,373 --> 00:38:00,706
you're better looking, but

806
00:38:00,707 --> 00:38:02,206
that's not enough, is it?

807
00:38:02,207 --> 00:38:04,331
I mean, why do you pick on guys like me?

808
00:38:04,332 --> 00:38:05,164
You know what I think?

809
00:38:05,165 --> 00:38:06,747
I think you're gay and you don't

810
00:38:06,748 --> 00:38:09,664
know how to handle it, so you pick on me because, inside,

811
00:38:09,665 --> 00:38:12,789
society picks on you.

812
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,956
That's not cool.

813
00:38:14,957 --> 00:38:16,706
Tommy's gay.
Oh, you are?

814
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:19,206
Yeah, it's not that big of a deal.

815
00:38:19,207 --> 00:38:20,997
The guys are super supportive.

816
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:21,789
Oh, that's so nice.

817
00:38:21,791 --> 00:38:25,539
Yeah, I guess it would have been worse
if you guys played a real sport, right?

818
00:38:27,707 --> 00:38:29,331
That came out wrong.

819
00:38:29,332 --> 00:38:30,122
Gabs, I got to go.

820
00:38:30,123 --> 00:38:31,957
Probably for the best.

821
00:38:32,873 --> 00:38:34,707
Get him!

822
00:38:37,373 --> 00:38:41,040
Aaaaaah!

823
00:38:45,373 --> 00:38:46,331
Oh, Rob! Can you --

824
00:38:46,332 --> 00:38:48,373
no!

825
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:04,622
Where is he?

826
00:39:04,623 --> 00:39:08,206
Try that one.

827
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,164
Oh, shit!

828
00:39:12,165 --> 00:39:12,872
Oh, no.

829
00:39:12,873 --> 00:39:13,706
No, no, no, no, no.

830
00:39:13,707 --> 00:39:14,456
Come on!

831
00:39:14,457 --> 00:39:15,664
Get it open!

832
00:39:15,665 --> 00:39:17,457
It's stuck! It's stuck!

833
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:37,998
One, two, three!

834
00:39:47,748 --> 00:39:50,498
Would you guys just stop banging for like 2 seconds?

835
00:39:56,373 --> 00:39:58,372
Ugh! He's whacking!

836
00:40:04,623 --> 00:40:08,164
Just... Throw the sheets
in the laundry, hon.

837
00:40:14,373 --> 00:40:17,039
Nothing happened.

838
00:40:18,123 --> 00:40:19,206
Mm.

839
00:40:19,207 --> 00:40:20,372
Good morning.

840
00:40:20,373 --> 00:40:21,706
Sit down. I want to talk to you.

841
00:40:21,707 --> 00:40:23,539
Dad...

842
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:26,706
Why is it so important to you that I go to Georgetown?

843
00:40:26,707 --> 00:40:28,706
Well, I guess because that's

844
00:40:28,707 --> 00:40:31,706
where I met your mother and my life really began.

845
00:40:31,707 --> 00:40:33,081
And you want that for me?

846
00:40:33,082 --> 00:40:35,164
Yes, of course.

847
00:40:35,165 --> 00:40:38,581
Well, what if I don't need Georgetown to get that?

848
00:40:38,582 --> 00:40:40,497
You don't want to go to Georgetown?

849
00:40:41,623 --> 00:40:43,831
No, I'm -- I'm just kidding.

850
00:40:43,832 --> 00:40:46,789
No, I just -- I don't need
a pep talk, that's all.

851
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:47,539
I got this.

852
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:53,206
You know, why don't you just focus on
planning your trip to parents' weekend.

853
00:40:53,207 --> 00:40:55,372
Okay.

854
00:40:55,373 --> 00:40:57,247
All right.

855
00:40:57,248 --> 00:41:00,540
Have a good day.

856
00:41:02,498 --> 00:41:07,206
I proved the existence of a sex jedi and
you're just speechless and smiling.

857
00:41:07,207 --> 00:41:09,539
Do you think about anything besides sex?

858
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,997
Yeah. I think about
a lot of stuff.

859
00:41:11,998 --> 00:41:14,539
Like why we're still reliant on foreign oil.

860
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,247
What I'd look like with a ponytail.

861
00:41:16,248 --> 00:41:17,414
You know?

862
00:41:17,415 --> 00:41:19,456
Why the sudden up tick in peanut allergies?

863
00:41:19,457 --> 00:41:20,539
You know, there are other

864
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,372
things in this world besides sex.

865
00:41:22,373 --> 00:41:24,706
Other things to see or do in this world.

866
00:41:24,707 --> 00:41:26,872
In this school, even.

867
00:41:26,873 --> 00:41:28,914
What the hell are you talking about?

868
00:41:28,915 --> 00:41:32,122
I'm talking about living a life without repercussions.

869
00:41:32,123 --> 00:41:32,831
Hi, guys.

870
00:41:32,833 --> 00:41:36,456
Hey, Gabs.
Hey, didn't your cousin get admitted to South oaks?

871
00:41:36,457 --> 00:41:39,372
Yeah. He had a psychotic break and
burned down his neighbor's shed.

872
00:41:39,373 --> 00:41:40,539
Thank you for bringing that up.

873
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,914
Uh-huh. We need to get Rob

874
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:46,414
Admitted there stat. He's fucking lost it you know,
I just woke up this morning, and long story short, I

875
00:41:46,415 --> 00:41:48,206
feel like I can do anything.

876
00:41:48,207 --> 00:41:50,289
Okay. Can we talk about
that on the way to class?

877
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:51,706
Yeah, let's go. I need
to make a poo.

878
00:41:51,707 --> 00:41:53,706
Yeah, you guys go.

879
00:41:53,707 --> 00:41:56,165
I don't really feel like walking.

880
00:41:59,373 --> 00:42:00,872
Yeah, you're right.
He's acting weird.

881
00:42:00,873 --> 00:42:02,081
Yeah. He's like the
douchey lama.

882
00:42:11,415 --> 00:42:13,331
Stop that golf cart!

883
00:42:14,373 --> 00:42:15,997
Show me your hall pass.

884
00:42:15,998 --> 00:42:18,956
Is there a hall pass for golf carts?

885
00:42:18,957 --> 00:42:20,622
I'm gonna have to write you up.

886
00:42:20,623 --> 00:42:22,206
You poor soul.

887
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:24,206
You don't know the power that you possess.

888
00:42:24,207 --> 00:42:27,414
I mean, you get beaten up every day, and for what?

889
00:42:27,415 --> 00:42:29,206
A line on a college resume

890
00:42:29,207 --> 00:42:31,622
I mean, what if instead of
writing people up, you used your

891
00:42:31,623 --> 00:42:34,039
position to your advantage, got something out of it.

892
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:38,747
Like, tell me that you won't write
me up if I give you the golf cart.

893
00:42:38,748 --> 00:42:39,914
You would do that?

894
00:42:39,915 --> 00:42:40,706
Maybe.

895
00:42:40,707 --> 00:42:43,414
Or... Excuse me, miss?

896
00:42:43,415 --> 00:42:45,372
Do you have a hall pass?

897
00:42:45,373 --> 00:42:47,039
Shit.

898
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,247
No.

899
00:42:48,248 --> 00:42:50,164
Ah, I'm not sure what we can do.

900
00:42:50,165 --> 00:42:53,956
You see, my friend here is a
hall monitor, and it is his job

901
00:42:53,957 --> 00:42:57,289
to write up students who roam the halls
without the necessary paperwork.

902
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:58,456
Please don't write me up.

903
00:42:58,457 --> 00:43:01,039
I'll get suspended if I get written up again.

904
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,872
Will you French kiss him?

905
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,206
Okay.

906
00:43:06,207 --> 00:43:07,164
But he can't tell anyone.

907
00:43:07,165 --> 00:43:08,206
Deal.

908
00:43:08,207 --> 00:43:11,039
But give him something to remember.

909
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,956
This is what you're doing with your day?

910
00:43:18,957 --> 00:43:21,622
Yeah, totally.

911
00:43:21,623 --> 00:43:23,372
Check this out.

912
00:43:23,373 --> 00:43:24,497
Where'd you get that?

913
00:43:24,498 --> 00:43:26,039
You know that creepy janitor?

914
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,956
It turns out he's not a pedophile.

915
00:43:27,957 --> 00:43:29,247
He's just a drug dealer.

916
00:43:29,248 --> 00:43:29,914
Huh.

917
00:43:29,915 --> 00:43:32,040
Hop in.

918
00:43:39,873 --> 00:43:41,372
Should we be out here?

919
00:43:42,457 --> 00:43:44,206
Nope.

920
00:43:44,207 --> 00:43:45,622
But that's what makes it fun?

921
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:46,414
Yep.

922
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:47,872
Mm-hmm.

923
00:43:47,873 --> 00:43:48,872
And if we get caught?

924
00:43:49,748 --> 00:43:51,789
Don't worry about it.

925
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:53,372
Just trust me.

926
00:43:53,373 --> 00:43:56,122
It's like that time that you
told me to tell my gym teacher I

927
00:43:56,123 --> 00:43:59,664
couldn't run the mile because of my menstrual cramps.

928
00:43:59,665 --> 00:44:00,414
Did I do it?

929
00:44:00,416 --> 00:44:02,997
Yep. Mr. Zizek still
calls you "tampon."

930
00:44:06,123 --> 00:44:07,456
I didn't say I'm not smoking with you.

931
00:44:07,457 --> 00:44:08,706
Come on.

932
00:44:08,707 --> 00:44:09,706
Light that thing up.

933
00:44:09,707 --> 00:44:11,622
Let us see if it is really a gateway drug.

934
00:44:11,623 --> 00:44:13,873
Oh. It is.

935
00:44:16,373 --> 00:44:17,997
A gateway to awesome.

936
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,039
Oh, thank you.

937
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:33,331
Hey, you, um, would you like to

938
00:44:33,332 --> 00:44:36,122
hear something that I've never told anyone ever?

939
00:44:36,123 --> 00:44:37,372
Yes.

940
00:44:37,373 --> 00:44:38,706
Freshman year, I thought that

941
00:44:38,707 --> 00:44:41,581
parent/teacher night meant that
Mrs. Wiley was going to be

942
00:44:41,582 --> 00:44:43,414
staying at my house for a night

943
00:44:43,415 --> 00:44:46,039
while my parents went away.

944
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:48,539
You would have to bomb your

945
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:50,497
house to get rid of the stench of her perfume.

946
00:44:50,498 --> 00:44:51,706
Oh, God.

947
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,372
How did we become friends?

948
00:45:05,373 --> 00:45:06,039
You don't remember?

949
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,372
No, it's not that I don't

950
00:45:07,373 --> 00:45:09,956
remember, it's just...

951
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:13,456
It feels like you've always been here.

952
00:45:13,457 --> 00:45:15,456
Sorry.

953
00:45:15,457 --> 00:45:18,831
Weed must make me uncomfortably deep.

954
00:45:18,832 --> 00:45:20,372
Uh-huh.

955
00:45:20,373 --> 00:45:23,081
Um... I was in the third grade

956
00:45:23,082 --> 00:45:25,664
and I was the new girl, the

957
00:45:25,665 --> 00:45:27,706
giant, 5'3" new girl.

958
00:45:27,707 --> 00:45:29,997
And you were the only one who

959
00:45:29,998 --> 00:45:31,247
didn't laugh at me.

960
00:45:31,248 --> 00:45:33,747
I was too scared to laugh.

961
00:45:33,748 --> 00:45:34,747
You were enormous.

962
00:45:43,082 --> 00:45:45,207
Oh.

963
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:51,789
Hey.

964
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:52,872
No matter where we end up next

965
00:45:52,873 --> 00:45:55,956
year, we have to watch the spelling bee together.

966
00:45:55,957 --> 00:45:59,039
Of course we will.

967
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,622
I'm really sorry that I blew you off this time.

968
00:46:02,623 --> 00:46:04,539
I'll never do it again.

969
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:08,372
When did you blow me off?

970
00:46:08,373 --> 00:46:13,039
I meant -- I meant to say I
would never blow you off.

971
00:46:14,998 --> 00:46:16,372
Sorry.

972
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:19,206
This stuff must really be killing brain cells.

973
00:46:21,373 --> 00:46:22,997
It's nice to get out like

974
00:46:22,998 --> 00:46:24,206
this once in awhile.

975
00:46:24,207 --> 00:46:25,206
You know?

976
00:46:25,207 --> 00:46:26,706
Get out of class, live a little.

977
00:46:26,707 --> 00:46:27,747
Yeah.

978
00:46:27,748 --> 00:46:28,706
We should have done something

979
00:46:28,707 --> 00:46:29,540
like this sooner.

980
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:32,039
I always wanted to.

981
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,872
Mm-hmm.

982
00:46:33,873 --> 00:46:36,206
You know what?

983
00:46:36,207 --> 00:46:37,622
Come on.

984
00:46:37,623 --> 00:46:39,039
Where are we going?

985
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:43,956
There's something else I've always wanted to do.

986
00:46:48,707 --> 00:46:49,789
Here.

987
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:51,164
It's pretty good, but kind of

988
00:46:51,165 --> 00:46:54,040
illegal.

989
00:47:05,873 --> 00:47:08,706
Oh, God.

990
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:14,331
Hold on!

991
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:15,914
Oh, hi, Mr. Hughes.

992
00:47:15,915 --> 00:47:18,039
Rob, this is the teachers' lounge.

993
00:47:18,041 --> 00:47:23,122
Yeah, I know. Um, hey, you wouldn't happen to have
a match or anything, would you?

994
00:47:23,123 --> 00:47:24,622
No? All right. Cool.

995
00:47:24,623 --> 00:47:26,622
Well, um, I should probably get going.

996
00:47:26,623 --> 00:47:28,331
But you should probably flush

997
00:47:28,332 --> 00:47:30,373
again, just in case.

998
00:47:43,373 --> 00:47:44,622
What was it like in there?

999
00:47:44,623 --> 00:47:46,039
It was very comfortable.

1000
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,872
There was a great selection of reading material.

1001
00:47:47,873 --> 00:47:49,707
Hm.

1002
00:48:00,207 --> 00:48:01,207
I fucking love doughnuts.

1003
00:48:05,373 --> 00:48:08,081
You know, all I'm saying is
that you have an inner strength

1004
00:48:08,082 --> 00:48:09,706
that one day I hope to have.

1005
00:48:09,707 --> 00:48:10,372
Thank you.

1006
00:48:10,373 --> 00:48:13,372
Shh. Hey. Don't thank me.

1007
00:48:13,373 --> 00:48:15,539
Okay? Because I am not
important right now.

1008
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:19,248
My interview? That
is not important.

1009
00:48:21,915 --> 00:48:24,206
I'm never gonna forget you.

1010
00:48:24,207 --> 00:48:26,040
I know.

1011
00:48:36,165 --> 00:48:37,497
Whoa!

1012
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:39,539
Hey!

1013
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:40,622
Whoo!

1014
00:48:40,623 --> 00:48:42,206
What the fuck was that?

1015
00:48:42,207 --> 00:48:44,581
Two men. Connecting.

1016
00:48:44,582 --> 00:48:45,581
Okay, cut the shit.

1017
00:48:45,582 --> 00:48:46,747
What is up with you today?

1018
00:48:46,748 --> 00:48:47,997
Gabs and I are worried.

1019
00:48:47,998 --> 00:48:48,706
I'm not worried.

1020
00:48:48,707 --> 00:48:49,872
Dude, I've told you.

1021
00:48:49,873 --> 00:48:50,997
You don't get it.

1022
00:48:50,998 --> 00:48:52,081
When did you tell me?

1023
00:48:52,082 --> 00:48:53,706
Three this mornings ago.

1024
00:48:53,707 --> 00:48:54,872
It's okay, okay?

1025
00:48:54,873 --> 00:48:57,706
Because I didn't really get it, either, but I do now.

1026
00:48:57,707 --> 00:49:00,207
Today is a gift.

1027
00:49:01,582 --> 00:49:02,331
Come on.

1028
00:49:02,332 --> 00:49:04,622
I just got an idea.

1029
00:49:04,623 --> 00:49:06,039
Okay, so, as I told you guys

1030
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,581
yesterday, tomorrow's quiz will

1031
00:49:07,582 --> 00:49:10,497
be on chapters 5 through 7, and

1032
00:49:10,498 --> 00:49:12,206
what you want to look --

1033
00:49:12,208 --> 00:49:16,497
Mr. Crabbe, your class
was two periods ago.

1034
00:49:16,498 --> 00:49:17,289
You missed it.

1035
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:19,372
I know. I was taking a shit.

1036
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,957
Excuse me?

1037
00:49:24,248 --> 00:49:25,372
Oh, my God.

1038
00:49:25,373 --> 00:49:26,872
What's he doing?

1039
00:49:26,873 --> 00:49:28,664
They're very firm, Stanley.

1040
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:30,164
Like, spongy.

1041
00:49:30,165 --> 00:49:32,957
Does that mean they're fake?

1042
00:49:33,873 --> 00:49:34,956
Oh, my God!

1043
00:49:34,957 --> 00:49:35,706
Thank you.

1044
00:49:35,707 --> 00:49:36,831
Sweet.

1045
00:49:36,832 --> 00:49:38,081
I think I smoked too much weed.

1046
00:49:38,082 --> 00:49:39,622
Did he just feel up
Ms. Hartnett?

1047
00:49:39,623 --> 00:49:41,039
Mm-hmm. I think she
called the cops.

1048
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,082
It was worth it.

1049
00:49:49,373 --> 00:49:51,498
Are these seats taken, Sally?

1050
00:49:59,082 --> 00:50:03,706
It has been a long time.

1051
00:50:03,707 --> 00:50:05,581
Whoa!

1052
00:50:05,582 --> 00:50:07,122
That was for the 4th grade!

1053
00:50:07,123 --> 00:50:10,372
Right?

1054
00:50:13,457 --> 00:50:15,497
Oh, shit.

1055
00:50:23,665 --> 00:50:25,997
Aaaah!

1056
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,164
Save yourself, Rob!

1057
00:50:37,165 --> 00:50:39,206
Grab her tit!

1058
00:50:39,207 --> 00:50:40,081
I'm grabbing her tit!

1059
00:50:40,082 --> 00:50:40,789
Aah!

1060
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:41,997
I'm grabbing your tit!

1061
00:50:41,998 --> 00:50:44,831
Squeeze it till milk comes out!

1062
00:50:44,832 --> 00:50:46,081
I'm sorry!

1063
00:50:46,082 --> 00:50:48,123
I'm sorry!

1064
00:50:50,332 --> 00:50:51,372
I'm sorry, Sally.

1065
00:50:51,373 --> 00:50:52,873
I'm a big fan.

1066
00:50:54,415 --> 00:50:55,289
Aah!

1067
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,372
Aaah!

1068
00:50:59,040 --> 00:50:59,872
That's got to hurt.

1069
00:50:59,873 --> 00:51:02,164
Aah!

1070
00:51:02,165 --> 00:51:03,998
Sally!

1071
00:51:09,082 --> 00:51:11,415
Aaah!

1072
00:51:23,373 --> 00:51:25,457
Have a seat, Rob.

1073
00:51:30,707 --> 00:51:32,622
I don't know what to say.

1074
00:51:32,623 --> 00:51:34,706
You're one of my favorite students.

1075
00:51:34,707 --> 00:51:35,914
Really?

1076
00:51:35,915 --> 00:51:37,497
We've barely met.

1077
00:51:37,498 --> 00:51:39,456
Yeah, exactly.

1078
00:51:39,457 --> 00:51:42,039
I love the students I don't have to meet.

1079
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:46,206
Meeting you guys is the worst part of my job.

1080
00:51:46,207 --> 00:51:47,331
Do you mind if I eat?

1081
00:51:47,332 --> 00:51:48,622
It's gonna be awhile before the

1082
00:51:48,623 --> 00:51:49,997
cops get here.

1083
00:51:49,998 --> 00:51:50,997
The cops?

1084
00:51:50,998 --> 00:51:52,997
Yes. The cops.

1085
00:51:52,998 --> 00:51:54,206
Geez.

1086
00:51:54,207 --> 00:51:56,206
You grabbed Ms.
Hartnett's breasts.

1087
00:51:56,207 --> 00:51:58,039
That's sexual assault.

1088
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,039
I mean, don't flatter yourself.

1089
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,331
They're also coming for some
moron bus driver who was toking

1090
00:52:02,332 --> 00:52:07,082
it up in one of the parked vehicles,
but you're the main focus.

1091
00:52:13,873 --> 00:52:15,747
So...

1092
00:52:15,748 --> 00:52:16,872
I don't mean to be flippant

1093
00:52:16,873 --> 00:52:20,081
about your situation, but

1094
00:52:20,082 --> 00:52:22,956
in an overcrowded public school like
this, if one of you students

1095
00:52:22,957 --> 00:52:22,957


1096
00:52:22,958 --> 00:52:30,747
wants to flush your future down the crapper and
I get to expel you, I am not losing my appetite over that.

1097
00:52:30,748 --> 00:52:31,956
Shit.

1098
00:52:31,957 --> 00:52:33,665
Fuck.

1099
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:38,956
All right, let's run down the hit list.

1100
00:52:38,957 --> 00:52:41,581
You molested a teacher.

1101
00:52:41,582 --> 00:52:47,581
You sexually harassed a female freshman
student and a male hall monitor.

1102
00:52:47,582 --> 00:52:50,206
And then --
This is funny.

1103
00:52:50,207 --> 00:52:52,747
You got in a fight with a girl and you lost.

1104
00:52:52,748 --> 00:52:55,789
She curb-stomped my
genitals. With her shoes.

1105
00:52:55,790 --> 00:52:56,539
Mm-hmm.

1106
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:59,997
Then I called your mom.
Your mom and dad are on their way, by the way.

1107
00:52:59,998 --> 00:53:02,456
And she said that she caught
you masturbating this morning.

1108
00:53:02,457 --> 00:53:03,289
It was a wet dream.

1109
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:05,039
I wasn't masturbating.

1110
00:53:05,041 --> 00:53:11,872
Whatever. Seems like to me you're going for a
varsity letter in sexual deviancy.

1111
00:53:11,873 --> 00:53:12,747
Can I go to the bathroom?

1112
00:53:12,748 --> 00:53:15,247
Yeah, in your pants.

1113
00:53:15,248 --> 00:53:17,165
'Cause you're not leaving this office.

1114
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,956
All right.

1115
00:53:19,957 --> 00:53:22,415
Let's take a look.

1116
00:53:23,082 --> 00:53:24,539
I can't figure out what would

1117
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:30,831
make a boy like you snap. I mean,
up to this point, no missteps.

1118
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:34,997
What would make a boy like you do what you did?

1119
00:53:34,998 --> 00:53:36,706
I mean, it's a big question.

1120
00:53:36,707 --> 00:53:38,956
Is society at fault?

1121
00:53:38,957 --> 00:53:41,372
Probably.

1122
00:53:41,373 --> 00:53:43,164
Have you got bad wiring?

1123
00:53:43,165 --> 00:53:45,790
Were you not hugged enough as a kid?

1124
00:53:46,998 --> 00:53:49,206
Rob, Rob, Robbie.

1125
00:53:49,207 --> 00:53:50,706
I mean, what is it?

1126
00:53:50,707 --> 00:53:54,039
You take Paxil or something?

1127
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:58,622
Maybe it's your home life.

1128
00:53:58,623 --> 00:54:00,539
I don't know.

1129
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:02,539
Maybe you have horrible parents.

1130
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:05,122
But here is the hard truth that

1131
00:54:05,123 --> 00:54:09,081
America is not prepared to admit.

1132
00:54:09,082 --> 00:54:14,039
We're all just... Filthy animals.

1133
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:16,664
And to expect us to play by the

1134
00:54:16,665 --> 00:54:19,289
prude rules --

1135
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:22,373
that's ri-goddamn-diculous.

1136
00:54:23,207 --> 00:54:24,122
I mean, what you did to

1137
00:54:24,123 --> 00:54:26,498
Ms. Hartnett...

1138
00:54:28,123 --> 00:54:32,457
We were all thinking about it.

1139
00:54:33,373 --> 00:54:34,622
As long as you don't sell crack

1140
00:54:34,624 --> 00:54:40,081
or burn the campus down, I really don't care if you
play a little ass-grab, but...

1141
00:54:40,082 --> 00:54:43,372
I mean, hell, if I had the budget, I would build us a

1142
00:54:43,373 --> 00:54:44,997
windowless room where you

1143
00:54:44,998 --> 00:54:46,747
perverts could just go in there

1144
00:54:46,748 --> 00:54:50,789
and poke and grab all day long.

1145
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:53,331
And I'd make it all out of cement, you know, so you could

1146
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:56,165
hose down all the... Fluids.

1147
00:54:57,123 --> 00:54:59,457
Come on!

1148
00:55:00,248 --> 00:55:02,331
Is that semen?

1149
00:55:02,332 --> 00:55:05,540
It's just a little Mayo.

1150
00:55:06,457 --> 00:55:08,789
My daughter made me that sandwich!

1151
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:12,456
That's a special sandwich, you little pervert!

1152
00:55:12,457 --> 00:55:13,206
Ohh!

1153
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:14,747
Cops are here.

1154
00:55:14,748 --> 00:55:17,289
Yeah, I know.

1155
00:55:17,290 --> 00:55:18,539
Dude, you got to get me out of here.

1156
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:20,623
Come on.

1157
00:55:23,998 --> 00:55:27,289
Uh, you do know that you're in the
girls' locker room, don't you?

1158
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:30,707
Tell that to your Adam's apple.

1159
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:35,706
Uh, sorry.

1160
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:36,956
Hide here until it's safe to leave.

1161
00:55:36,957 --> 00:55:37,706
What?

1162
00:55:37,707 --> 00:55:39,623
Don't go anywhere.

1163
00:55:49,457 --> 00:55:51,789
Come on!

1164
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:54,082
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1165
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:00,706
Are you talking to me?

1166
00:56:00,707 --> 00:56:05,956
No. I was yelling at my dick because it won't get hard.

1167
00:56:05,957 --> 00:56:07,956
There's a guy in there.
I think he's...

1168
00:56:07,957 --> 00:56:09,039
Molesting himself?

1169
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:13,040
It sure sounds like it.
Do you want to watch?

1170
00:56:15,498 --> 00:56:18,039
Hey, man. What the
fuck are you doing?

1171
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,747
I really need to jerk off, but it's not working, and I

1172
00:56:20,748 --> 00:56:22,372
think I might have broken it.

1173
00:56:22,373 --> 00:56:23,997
Wait. Why do you
need to jerk off?

1174
00:56:23,998 --> 00:56:25,706
Dude, I really don't have time to explain right now.

1175
00:56:25,707 --> 00:56:29,998
Just help me or get the fuck away.

1176
00:56:37,373 --> 00:56:39,872
You want to fuck Mistah?

1177
00:56:39,873 --> 00:56:43,539
I'll fuck you first one free.
I'll give you all my holes.

1178
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:45,914
Even brown one.

1179
00:56:45,915 --> 00:56:46,956
Stanley?

1180
00:56:46,957 --> 00:56:48,664
Yeah?

1181
00:56:48,665 --> 00:56:50,039
What the fuck are you doing?

1182
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,331
I'm trying to help.

1183
00:56:51,332 --> 00:56:54,039
I went Asian. Asian seems
right, you know?

1184
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:57,706
Put your egg roll in my sticky bun!

1185
00:56:57,707 --> 00:57:01,331
Ooh, we do fucky-fucky!
Fucky now!

1186
00:57:01,332 --> 00:57:02,997
Let's do fucky-fucky!

1187
00:57:02,998 --> 00:57:04,039
Shut the hell up.

1188
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,539
You shut the hell up!

1189
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:07,206
Stanley, come on.
Stop, man.

1190
00:57:07,207 --> 00:57:08,331
I really need to focus.

1191
00:57:08,332 --> 00:57:10,081
Oh, no. Do me!

1192
00:57:10,082 --> 00:57:12,539
Do me doggie style, then we eat dog!

1193
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:13,956
Woof!

1194
00:57:13,957 --> 00:57:15,747
Come on, man. Please stop.
You're ruining it.

1195
00:57:15,748 --> 00:57:19,372
No, you stop, Mr. America.
Choke me.

1196
00:57:19,373 --> 00:57:20,706
Choke me!

1197
00:57:20,707 --> 00:57:22,039
Choke me!

1198
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,331
You fuck her from the front, "G."

1199
00:57:24,332 --> 00:57:26,206
I'mma fuck her from the back.

1200
00:57:26,207 --> 00:57:27,456
Yeah.

1201
00:57:27,457 --> 00:57:29,539
What the hell is that?

1202
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:31,372
It's the only other voice I can do.

1203
00:57:34,957 --> 00:57:40,123
I'm gonna go find the cops. Maybe getting
raped in jail is gonna do the trick.

1204
00:57:45,873 --> 00:57:47,039
Oh, no.

1205
00:57:56,707 --> 00:58:00,248
Just... Throw the sheets in
the laundry, hon.

1206
00:58:02,415 --> 00:58:05,497
You got to be fucking kidding me!

1207
00:58:05,498 --> 00:58:06,664
What was that, Robert?!

1208
00:58:06,665 --> 00:58:09,039
You got to be fucking kidding me!

1209
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,164
Look at yourself!

1210
00:58:11,165 --> 00:58:13,372
I'm sorry, mom.

1211
00:58:13,373 --> 00:58:17,372
I can't believe this is my fucking life.

1212
00:58:17,373 --> 00:58:21,540
Aaaaaaaaaah!

1213
00:58:24,207 --> 00:58:26,039
You're not gonna lock your bike up?

1214
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,872
Hey, guys.

1215
00:58:28,873 --> 00:58:29,622
What time are you flying out, Artie?

1216
00:58:29,624 --> 00:58:34,456
Funny, Stanley. Too bad the special Olympics
doesn't have a comedy competition.

1217
00:58:34,457 --> 00:58:37,372
So, Rob, Gabrielle told me
your Georgetown interview is --

1218
00:58:37,373 --> 00:58:38,497
today.

1219
00:58:38,498 --> 00:58:40,997
And no, I don't want to drop your name.

1220
00:58:40,998 --> 00:58:43,122
I mean, I could, but, you know,

1221
00:58:43,123 --> 00:58:44,914
I'd rather not be associated with you.

1222
00:58:44,915 --> 00:58:46,997
Rob. What's wrong?

1223
00:58:46,998 --> 00:58:48,539
It's not the interview.

1224
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:50,331
You want to talk about it?

1225
00:58:50,332 --> 00:58:52,372
I'm good.

1226
00:58:52,373 --> 00:58:53,664
Well, it's bee day, right?

1227
00:58:53,665 --> 00:58:56,456
Yeah, about that.
I have to cancel.

1228
00:58:56,457 --> 00:58:58,039
Really? Just like that?

1229
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:00,123
Yes, just like that.

1230
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:04,497
Hey!

1231
00:59:04,498 --> 00:59:06,372
Aw!

1232
00:59:06,373 --> 00:59:09,539
I don't know what's going on here, but
promise me you'll turn the darkness off for

1233
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:10,747
your interview.

1234
00:59:10,749 --> 00:59:12,997
Why? 'Cause you've worked your ass off for it.

1235
00:59:12,998 --> 00:59:14,997
And I need to know you're not gonna throw it away.

1236
00:59:14,998 --> 00:59:16,706
If I have to do the interview with you, I will.

1237
00:59:16,707 --> 00:59:19,831
Stop fucking around,
man. I'm not --

1238
00:59:19,832 --> 00:59:21,289
I'm not in a good place right now.

1239
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:26,039
I'm not fucking around. You're my best friend.
I'd do anything for you.

1240
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:26,872
Do you mean that?

1241
00:59:26,873 --> 00:59:28,540
Yeah. I mean that.

1242
00:59:29,707 --> 00:59:31,997
I mean, 'cause you've never really told me that before.

1243
00:59:31,998 --> 00:59:35,831
Well, I never knew I had to.

1244
00:59:35,832 --> 00:59:37,539
I don't know, you're just --

1245
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:40,581
you're always so vulgar, you know?

1246
00:59:40,582 --> 00:59:42,122
I bury my emotions. It's a
defense mechanism.

1247
00:59:47,123 --> 00:59:48,206
I'm gonna hug you now.

1248
00:59:48,207 --> 00:59:51,790
I know.

1249
00:59:52,832 --> 00:59:54,664
Hey, guys.

1250
00:59:54,665 --> 00:59:55,331
Oh.

1251
00:59:55,332 --> 00:59:56,081
Hi, Angela.

1252
00:59:56,082 --> 00:59:58,414
Hey... Angela. How are you?

1253
00:59:58,415 --> 01:00:00,539
Why are you guys hugging?

1254
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:03,747
It's 2013, Angela. Men
hug now, you know?

1255
01:00:03,748 --> 01:00:05,872
Deal with it.

1256
01:00:05,873 --> 01:00:10,122
So, Rob. Um, I was gonna come find
you later, but since you're here, I

1257
01:00:10,123 --> 01:00:13,289
know our tutoring session isn't technically
supposed to be until Thursday, but --

1258
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:16,956
tonight. Um... Yeah. Sure.

1259
01:00:16,957 --> 01:00:22,039
Great. And could we do it at my house?

1260
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,372
If we have to.

1261
01:00:23,373 --> 01:00:26,206
Perfect. Come over
around 7:00.

1262
01:00:26,207 --> 01:00:27,206
Great.

1263
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:29,748
Nice hoodie.

1264
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,747
Tracing the man's slow fall into madness.

1265
01:00:33,748 --> 01:00:38,331
I'll start reading and then we'll go
around the room counterclockwise.

1266
01:00:38,332 --> 01:00:40,747
Okay, let's get started.

1267
01:00:40,748 --> 01:00:44,247
Mr. Crabbe, would you mind taking
your seat so we can begin?

1268
01:00:44,248 --> 01:00:48,039
Oh, no, if it's okay, I'm
just -- I'm gonna stand.

1269
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,082
No, it's not okay.

1270
01:00:59,165 --> 01:01:01,497
I need Rob Crabbe to the main office.

1271
01:01:01,498 --> 01:01:05,498
Oh, wow. Aren't you
glad I took my seat?

1272
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:11,872
As I recite the poem out loud, listen for the repetition

1273
01:01:11,873 --> 01:01:13,956
of the word "nevermore."

1274
01:01:13,957 --> 01:01:15,956
Gabs?

1275
01:01:15,957 --> 01:01:16,706
Huh.

1276
01:01:16,707 --> 01:01:18,372
..."while I pondered weak and

1277
01:01:18,373 --> 01:01:20,706
weary, over many a quaint and

1278
01:01:20,707 --> 01:01:22,706
curious volume of forgotten

1279
01:01:22,707 --> 01:01:24,373
lore"...

1280
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:27,456
Mr. Crabbe, good to
meet you, young man.

1281
01:01:27,458 --> 01:01:34,372
How's your day going? Not gonna lie.
Today has been a never-ending cluster fuck.

1282
01:01:34,373 --> 01:01:37,206
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

1283
01:01:37,207 --> 01:01:42,956
But as I've learned, in the light of some
recent difficult events, each day is a gift.

1284
01:01:42,957 --> 01:01:45,957
Yeah, it is a gift you can't return.

1285
01:01:48,998 --> 01:01:52,539
You have a very impressive application.

1286
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:56,789
Everything on there was designed
to solicit that exact response.

1287
01:01:56,791 --> 01:02:00,331
What? I have lived to get into this school.

1288
01:02:00,332 --> 01:02:04,372
You know I even have a set of perfectly scripted
responses to virtually every question that

1289
01:02:04,373 --> 01:02:06,206
you could ever ask?

1290
01:02:06,207 --> 01:02:10,497
Hell, at one point, I was so nervous
I might have even over-performed.

1291
01:02:10,498 --> 01:02:11,706
But not now.

1292
01:02:11,707 --> 01:02:13,372
Why? Why not now?

1293
01:02:13,373 --> 01:02:16,206
Oh, I could tell you, but you'd never believe me.

1294
01:02:16,207 --> 01:02:20,539
Is it the pressure? Because I can tell
you, you're a lock for our school.

1295
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:22,122
Is it a girl?

1296
01:02:22,123 --> 01:02:23,039
Is it a girl?

1297
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,997
I can tell you, there's gonna be others.

1298
01:02:24,998 --> 01:02:29,372
There will, and when the
right one... Presents herself...

1299
01:02:29,374 --> 01:02:33,956
She will... Oh, God.
I was really hoping you wouldn't cry this time.

1300
01:02:33,957 --> 01:02:34,706
What?

1301
01:02:34,708 --> 01:02:42,081
Nothing. Here's the problem. There are certain things
that I thought I wanted, like getting

1302
01:02:42,082 --> 01:02:45,372
in to Georgetown or fucking Angela Yearwood, but then I

1303
01:02:45,373 --> 01:02:48,247
realized I don't actually want any of those things.

1304
01:02:48,248 --> 01:02:49,247
Uh...

1305
01:02:49,248 --> 01:02:51,164
Other people just want them for me.

1306
01:02:51,165 --> 01:02:53,206
Having sex is nothing you should take lightly.

1307
01:02:53,208 --> 01:02:56,706
I know that.
I've had, like, seven orgasms so far today.

1308
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:01,207
Holy shit.

1309
01:03:03,957 --> 01:03:06,622
How'd it go?

1310
01:03:06,623 --> 01:03:07,956
Look on the bright side.

1311
01:03:07,957 --> 01:03:10,872
Tonight you get to have sex with Angela Yearwood.

1312
01:03:10,873 --> 01:03:12,372
No.

1313
01:03:12,373 --> 01:03:14,415
The worst part is I don't.

1314
01:03:23,207 --> 01:03:25,039
Hey. I thought
you had to cancel.

1315
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:28,414
Can I come in?
I'm not good.

1316
01:03:28,415 --> 01:03:34,372
And I don't even get to actually have sex.
I just orgasm prematurely and

1317
01:03:34,373 --> 01:03:37,289
then I wake up back in my room.

1318
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:43,414
And then my mom comes in to find
me sitting on a massive wet spot.

1319
01:03:43,415 --> 01:03:44,997
Do you believe me?

1320
01:03:44,998 --> 01:03:47,956
Only the part about you waking up in
a massive wet spot every morning.

1321
01:03:47,957 --> 01:03:51,956
Gabs, I know that this sounds
fucking crazy, but I'm serious.

1322
01:03:51,957 --> 01:03:54,081
Mmkay, what am I gonna say now?

1323
01:03:54,082 --> 01:03:57,372
I don't know. I --
I haven't done this part yet.

1324
01:03:57,373 --> 01:03:59,206
Oh, okay, so every day is not the same.

1325
01:03:59,207 --> 01:04:00,997
You can do different things.

1326
01:04:00,998 --> 01:04:06,122
Yes, yes, but... inevitably,
I have an orgasm.

1327
01:04:06,123 --> 01:04:09,206
Okay. All right. That's... Great.

1328
01:04:09,207 --> 01:04:10,997
You got to believe me.

1329
01:04:10,998 --> 01:04:14,997
I don't, but, uh, I'm worried about you now, so...

1330
01:04:14,998 --> 01:04:16,747
Walk me through this
never-ending day?

1331
01:04:16,748 --> 01:04:17,706
Okay, um...

1332
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:19,789
Well, I wake up...

1333
01:04:19,790 --> 01:04:21,206
Just... Throw the sheets in --

1334
01:04:21,207 --> 01:04:22,289
smell of a champ--

1335
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:23,039
Rob!

1336
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:23,997
Hi, guys.

1337
01:04:23,998 --> 01:04:24,706
A mammogram.

1338
01:04:24,707 --> 01:04:25,372
Nevermore.

1339
01:04:26,123 --> 01:04:26,831
Pongsaklek Wonjongkam.

1340
01:04:27,623 --> 01:04:28,372
No.

1341
01:04:28,373 --> 01:04:30,372
Can I confess something to you?

1342
01:04:30,373 --> 01:04:31,081
Ka-boom.

1343
01:04:31,998 --> 01:04:34,039
And that's all you can think of?

1344
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:36,997
Well, one time Sally Levinson

1345
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:41,914
kicked an orgasm out of me, but those are the constants.

1346
01:04:41,915 --> 01:04:44,539
Right.

1347
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:47,622
Look, it's, uh, it's getting
late and I have a test tomorrow.

1348
01:04:47,623 --> 01:04:50,039
Gabs, come on, okay? Please?

1349
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:51,706
Please help me.

1350
01:04:51,707 --> 01:04:54,289
Look, if you're just gonna live this day
over again, you got to tell me earlier.

1351
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:55,914
Like, third period.

1352
01:04:55,915 --> 01:04:57,706
And have you not believe me again?

1353
01:04:57,708 --> 01:05:03,122
Thanks. Okay, look. Just, if you
want me to believe you...

1354
01:05:03,123 --> 01:05:04,539
When you tell me your story,

1355
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:07,164
just mention the Abraham Lincoln

1356
01:05:07,165 --> 01:05:10,706
sex fantasy and I will believe you.

1357
01:05:10,707 --> 01:05:13,706
Ew. You have an Abraham
Lincoln sex fantasy?

1358
01:05:13,707 --> 01:05:17,039
I had a dream where he...

1359
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:20,039
Emancipated my g-spot.

1360
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:22,664
It was unforgettable.

1361
01:05:22,665 --> 01:05:23,539
Oh, my God.

1362
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:24,997
Okay, do you want my help or not?

1363
01:05:24,998 --> 01:05:27,581
Just forget it.

1364
01:05:27,582 --> 01:05:30,997
We do have one other option.

1365
01:05:30,998 --> 01:05:34,414
We can talk to the smartest person I know.

1366
01:05:34,415 --> 01:05:36,206
You've come to me for help.

1367
01:05:36,207 --> 01:05:38,997
Pardon me while I savor this moment.

1368
01:05:38,998 --> 01:05:40,539
Told you this was a bad idea.

1369
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:41,706
Just wait.

1370
01:05:41,707 --> 01:05:43,581
Arthur, we really need your help.

1371
01:05:43,582 --> 01:05:47,289
While I applaud your decision to discuss the
matter with me, I have little experience with

1372
01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:49,497
mental illness.

1373
01:05:49,498 --> 01:05:50,998
Also, he's a dick.

1374
01:06:14,373 --> 01:06:19,456
I'm sorry, guys, but my mom says you
have to leave before my Nana sees you.

1375
01:06:19,457 --> 01:06:21,206
Why? What's up with your Nana?

1376
01:06:25,248 --> 01:06:27,039
Mama, no!

1377
01:06:27,707 --> 01:06:30,997
Aah! Mama!

1378
01:06:30,998 --> 01:06:33,747
What the fuck?!

1379
01:06:33,748 --> 01:06:37,039
Mama! Mama!

1380
01:06:49,415 --> 01:06:51,039
Mama?

1381
01:06:52,623 --> 01:06:54,456
Is she dead?

1382
01:06:54,457 --> 01:06:55,581
Aah!

1383
01:06:58,457 --> 01:07:00,414
Oh, no!

1384
01:07:00,415 --> 01:07:02,539
Oh, no! Get her off of me!

1385
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:04,664
Get her off of me!

1386
01:07:09,748 --> 01:07:11,539
Get her off!

1387
01:07:11,540 --> 01:07:13,539
Get... Her... Off.

1388
01:07:23,707 --> 01:07:25,372
Jadoogar.

1389
01:07:27,707 --> 01:07:28,414
Where are you going?

1390
01:07:28,415 --> 01:07:29,206
School.

1391
01:07:29,207 --> 01:07:29,956
Not like that.

1392
01:07:29,957 --> 01:07:32,373
It's okay. It get a do-over.

1393
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:37,956
Hey, Arthur.

1394
01:07:37,957 --> 01:07:39,164
Oh, hey, Rob. I got
beer for tonight.

1395
01:07:39,165 --> 01:07:40,581
I need to talk to you.

1396
01:07:40,582 --> 01:07:42,039
I'm pretty busy.

1397
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:42,914
Are you okay?

1398
01:07:42,915 --> 01:07:44,206
No. I'm not okay.

1399
01:07:44,207 --> 01:07:47,039
I'm stuck in the same day, and
it's a fucking hell that you

1400
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:49,372
can't even fathom, and it just keeps happening.

1401
01:07:49,373 --> 01:07:52,622
I wake up, life kicks the shit
out of me, and then I have an

1402
01:07:52,623 --> 01:07:57,456
orgasm, and then I live the same day all over
again, and I know that that sounds crazy, but it's

1403
01:07:57,457 --> 01:08:00,664
true, and I think that this little
fucker can explain it to me.

1404
01:08:00,665 --> 01:08:02,997
Wow, I've never seen a midlife crisis before.

1405
01:08:02,998 --> 01:08:04,164
He's 17.

1406
01:08:04,165 --> 01:08:07,622
I always saw him going young.
Drugs or a plane crash.

1407
01:08:07,623 --> 01:08:09,247
Anyway, hope it works out, Rob.

1408
01:08:09,248 --> 01:08:10,039
Whoa, whoa, okay.

1409
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:10,747
Watch it.

1410
01:08:10,748 --> 01:08:12,289
These fibers are delicate.

1411
01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:14,039
All right, so, he's, like, 5.

1412
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:14,706
Hey, no!

1413
01:08:14,708 --> 01:08:18,872
Hey! Get back here! Get back
here, you little shit!

1414
01:08:18,873 --> 01:08:20,581
Arthur!

1415
01:08:20,582 --> 01:08:22,665
Arthur!

1416
01:08:27,248 --> 01:08:29,373
Oh, no. Oh.

1417
01:08:47,415 --> 01:08:52,997
He's in there. I'll give you
2 minutes, but make it rough on him.

1418
01:08:52,998 --> 01:08:56,582
I'm talking "slamming balls on the toilet seat" rough.

1419
01:09:05,165 --> 01:09:07,414
Hey, whoa, whoa. Uh,
maintenance. Keep it moving.

1420
01:09:07,415 --> 01:09:08,497
But it's an emergency.

1421
01:09:08,498 --> 01:09:10,457
I'll fucking kill you.

1422
01:09:15,748 --> 01:09:18,539
Please stop!
Someone just pooped in here! I can smell it!

1423
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:20,081
What does a "jadoogar" mean?

1424
01:09:20,082 --> 01:09:23,331
Wait, what?

1425
01:09:23,332 --> 01:09:25,206
What does "jadoogar" mean?!

1426
01:09:25,207 --> 01:09:26,539
"Curse"! I think
it means "curse"!

1427
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:27,331
What kind of curse?!

1428
01:09:27,332 --> 01:09:30,122
Like a jinx!

1429
01:09:30,123 --> 01:09:31,331
How do I get rid of one?!

1430
01:09:31,332 --> 01:09:32,331
How should I know?!

1431
01:09:32,332 --> 01:09:33,664
Because your grandma put it on me!

1432
01:09:33,665 --> 01:09:36,206
That's crazy! My Nana
doesn't even know who you are!

1433
01:09:36,207 --> 01:09:38,539
Your Nana put a fucking jadoogar on me!

1434
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:45,289
No! No way! Please don't dunk me again.
I can feel sores opening up on my lips and in my mouth.

1435
01:09:51,665 --> 01:09:53,206
Here.

1436
01:09:56,457 --> 01:10:00,165
If I had a knife, I'd stab you in the fucking throat.

1437
01:10:07,722 --> 01:10:09,289
- Have you checked your voicemail?
- Are you okay?

1438
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:10,914
- You're acting kind of weird.
- The most amazing thing...

1439
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:11,914
I'm cursed.

1440
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:17,164
What do you mean, you're cursed? That first-generation
asshole just told me that I'm cursed and that this fucking shit-storm of

1441
01:10:17,165 --> 01:10:18,206
a day is just going to keep repeating.

1442
01:10:18,208 --> 01:10:21,747
That's ridiculous. You know what's ridiculous?
Is wanting to have sexual intercourse with

1443
01:10:21,748 --> 01:10:22,789
Abraham Lincoln.

1444
01:10:22,791 --> 01:10:27,039
How do you know about that? Because I've
been through every nook and cranny today has to offer.

1445
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:29,997
You told me to say it, at
9:00 tonight yesterday.

1446
01:10:29,998 --> 01:10:32,122
And then I blew a load on Arthur's mom's ample chest, and

1447
01:10:32,123 --> 01:10:33,539
then I woke up back where I started.

1448
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:34,581
Whatever, dude. Listen,
this morning --

1449
01:10:34,582 --> 01:10:38,164
Lisa's a jizz jedi. Nobody
cares right now.

1450
01:10:38,165 --> 01:10:39,789
Not like a curse is such a big deal.

1451
01:10:39,790 --> 01:10:41,622
Well, if it's not, then solve it for me.

1452
01:10:41,623 --> 01:10:43,372
Okay, it's pretty simple.

1453
01:10:43,373 --> 01:10:46,372
A curse is the universe trying to
make you right a cosmic wrong.

1454
01:10:46,373 --> 01:10:48,497
You have to figure out what
made the curse start and fix it.

1455
01:10:48,498 --> 01:10:49,497
And how do you know that?

1456
01:10:49,498 --> 01:10:51,539
Duh -- the curse of the bambino.

1457
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:54,414
By some sort of divine intervention, the Boston Red Sox

1458
01:10:54,415 --> 01:10:57,706
got babe Ruth, and they traded him to the Yankees.

1459
01:10:57,707 --> 01:10:59,747
To break the curse, they had to beat the yanks.

1460
01:10:59,748 --> 01:11:02,206
It took them over 80 fucking years, but they fixed it.

1461
01:11:02,207 --> 01:11:03,581
The universe is a cruel bitch.

1462
01:11:03,582 --> 01:11:04,956
You know, Stanley, you can

1463
01:11:04,957 --> 01:11:07,414
always say, "I don't know" every once in awhile.

1464
01:11:07,415 --> 01:11:10,206
You don't always have to bullshit every
time there's a pause in the conversation.

1465
01:11:10,207 --> 01:11:14,997
Oh, well, if you have a better idea, why are
you still stuck in the same fucking day?

1466
01:11:14,998 --> 01:11:18,081
Curses are bullshit.
Now say sorry and go conquer

1467
01:11:18,082 --> 01:11:20,039
that which has been unconquerable.

1468
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:20,956
Angela.

1469
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:23,206
I got to go.

1470
01:11:23,207 --> 01:11:24,122
Hey!

1471
01:11:24,123 --> 01:11:26,747
Dude, I'm still waiting for the apology.

1472
01:11:26,748 --> 01:11:29,122
Kids, tomorrow I'm going to be out with a substitute and

1473
01:11:29,123 --> 01:11:32,581
the next day I'm gonna have a big story
to tell you all about my mammogram.

1474
01:11:32,582 --> 01:11:33,539
Uh, Miss Marconi.

1475
01:11:33,541 --> 01:11:36,997
Rob? Angela's wanted down at the main office.

1476
01:11:36,998 --> 01:11:38,872
Do you have a pass?

1477
01:11:38,873 --> 01:11:39,706
No.

1478
01:11:39,707 --> 01:11:41,706
Then she can't go with you.

1479
01:11:41,707 --> 01:11:43,206
Uh, fine.

1480
01:11:43,207 --> 01:11:50,331
Angela, tonight. I am coming over and not for tutoring.

1481
01:11:50,332 --> 01:11:51,497
Rob.

1482
01:11:51,498 --> 01:11:53,122
What?

1483
01:11:53,123 --> 01:11:54,664
Spelling bee.

1484
01:11:54,665 --> 01:11:58,247
Seriously? Spelling bee?

1485
01:11:58,248 --> 01:12:00,039
You okay with that?

1486
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:01,956
Sure.

1487
01:12:01,957 --> 01:12:04,248
You may continue your class now.

1488
01:12:08,582 --> 01:12:12,540
Okay, I need you to tell me everything
you know about pleasing a woman.

1489
01:12:18,248 --> 01:12:20,039
Jesus.

1490
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:24,289
He's like the bill belichick of lady parts.

1491
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:25,956
Promise me you won't watch.

1492
01:12:25,957 --> 01:12:28,040
I can make no such promises.

1493
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:44,082
Aw, motherfucker!

1494
01:12:47,123 --> 01:12:48,706
What made you do this?

1495
01:12:48,707 --> 01:12:53,539
You know, I wanted to for, like, the longest time, and it

1496
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:56,372
felt like you were finally
starting to notice me, you know?

1497
01:12:56,373 --> 01:13:01,039
Like, maybe the universe wanted this to happen.

1498
01:13:07,623 --> 01:13:10,956
This is really nice. Usually
I'm with older guys, so...

1499
01:13:10,957 --> 01:13:14,206
Yeah, well, I am more romance, less body hair, so...

1500
01:13:19,373 --> 01:13:21,289
You know what could be really fun?

1501
01:13:21,290 --> 01:13:23,622
If we stopped studying altogether and just did this.

1502
01:13:23,623 --> 01:13:26,206
Okay.

1503
01:13:26,207 --> 01:13:28,039
That way, I mean, you just have to, like, hook me up with

1504
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:30,539
cheat sheets and write my papers for me.

1505
01:13:31,665 --> 01:13:34,206
But I tutor you.

1506
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:36,747
Yeah, but isn't this better?

1507
01:13:36,748 --> 01:13:39,789
I mean, we can fun during our
study sessions, and then you can

1508
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:41,289
go home and do my work after.

1509
01:13:45,999 --> 01:13:52,539
Okay, but... You don't ever
have to act cool around me.

1510
01:13:52,541 --> 01:13:58,206
What? I thought that's why you like me,
that and I make you feel safe.

1511
01:13:58,873 --> 01:13:59,831
I never said that.

1512
01:14:04,207 --> 01:14:09,706
You are right. Um...
Look, Angela, you are obviously

1513
01:14:09,707 --> 01:14:12,914
very, very hot, but, you know what?

1514
01:14:12,915 --> 01:14:14,372
This never works out.

1515
01:14:14,373 --> 01:14:19,539
I mean, I have tried to have sex with
you like 6 times, and I'm done.

1516
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:23,581
I mean, I don't know where I'm supposed
to be, but it is definitely not here.

1517
01:14:23,582 --> 01:14:25,581
And I'm sorry --
white zinfandel?

1518
01:14:25,582 --> 01:14:27,414
What are you? Like, 45?

1519
01:14:27,415 --> 01:14:29,789
Okay, then you can get the fuck out of here.

1520
01:14:29,790 --> 01:14:32,707
Will do.

1521
01:14:34,832 --> 01:14:38,790
Dick.
White zin's delish.

1522
01:14:40,707 --> 01:14:41,539
That was quick.

1523
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:42,706
Go fuck yourself.

1524
01:14:54,165 --> 01:14:56,997
I talked to my buddies in admissions.

1525
01:14:56,998 --> 01:14:59,372
You don't think I would have found
out that you blew off the interview?

1526
01:14:59,374 --> 01:15:03,747
How'd you even find me? I went to
Gabrielle's to tear you away from the spelling bee.

1527
01:15:03,748 --> 01:15:08,122
She told me you went over to
"what's-her-slut's" -- her words.

1528
01:15:08,123 --> 01:15:12,039
Dad, it has been a really long day.

1529
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:12,706
Oh.

1530
01:15:12,707 --> 01:15:16,206
It's not over yet. Here.

1531
01:15:16,207 --> 01:15:18,040
Put this on.

1532
01:15:30,415 --> 01:15:32,497
There he is.

1533
01:15:32,498 --> 01:15:37,582
Oh, Jesus. Okay.
Get your game face on.

1534
01:15:39,873 --> 01:15:42,289
Jack Roth?

1535
01:15:42,290 --> 01:15:43,706
Yeah?

1536
01:15:43,707 --> 01:15:47,747
I'm Jim Crabbe. This is
my son, Rob.

1537
01:15:47,748 --> 01:15:51,372
We talked on the phone before.

1538
01:15:51,373 --> 01:15:53,039
Right.

1539
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,665
Right.

1540
01:15:55,207 --> 01:15:56,997
Have a seat.

1541
01:15:56,998 --> 01:15:59,039
Great.

1542
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,956
Thanks for seeing us before you left town.

1543
01:16:00,957 --> 01:16:04,039
Jim, could you go get us some scotch?

1544
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:07,122
Couple scotches?
Service here is shit.

1545
01:16:07,123 --> 01:16:08,456
Oh, sure. Okay.

1546
01:16:08,457 --> 01:16:09,956
Um... What'll you have?

1547
01:16:09,957 --> 01:16:16,789
Dewar's on the rocks with a twist.
Make it a double.

1548
01:16:19,707 --> 01:16:22,289
Your dad really wants you to go to Georgetown.

1549
01:16:22,290 --> 01:16:23,540
Yeah.

1550
01:16:25,290 --> 01:16:26,707
Do you?

1551
01:16:29,665 --> 01:16:31,872
What's going through your mind right now?

1552
01:16:31,873 --> 01:16:36,040
Just that I can't wait for this day to be over.

1553
01:16:37,332 --> 01:16:41,582
You and me both.

1554
01:16:42,707 --> 01:16:47,206
My cat shits outside of the box.

1555
01:16:47,207 --> 01:16:52,664
Not down the hall or in the basement or
in my bed, just right outside of the box.

1556
01:16:52,665 --> 01:16:54,706
It's a big "fuck you."

1557
01:16:54,707 --> 01:16:56,664
Yeah, what's up with that?

1558
01:16:56,665 --> 01:17:01,373
My wife passed away a few months ago.

1559
01:17:02,582 --> 01:17:07,040
And the cat really loved her.

1560
01:17:08,873 --> 01:17:13,456
He wishes I had died instead of her.
That's what he's saying.

1561
01:17:13,457 --> 01:17:20,039
Have you considered that maybe...
Your cat's just an asshole?

1562
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:23,206
He is an asshole.

1563
01:17:23,207 --> 01:17:24,957
Thank you.

1564
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:28,706
There we go.

1565
01:17:28,707 --> 01:17:33,539
Jim, I was just asking your son why he wants
to go to Georgetown, but I would like to

1566
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:38,122
hear it from you. Why do you want him to go to Georgetown?

1567
01:17:38,123 --> 01:17:42,956
Well, my going there was the
transformative experience of my life.

1568
01:17:42,957 --> 01:17:47,456
And you just assume that what was best
for you is also the best for him?

1569
01:17:47,457 --> 01:17:49,706
Let me put it this way.

1570
01:17:49,707 --> 01:17:53,747
I had a choice. It was either
Georgetown or Yale.

1571
01:17:53,748 --> 01:17:57,331
Why did you choose Georgetown?

1572
01:17:57,332 --> 01:18:01,372
I actually -- I didn't
choose it.

1573
01:18:01,373 --> 01:18:03,873
Georgetown gave me a scholarship.

1574
01:18:05,540 --> 01:18:11,372
Sometimes the universe has a way of helping
when you're about to make a mistake.

1575
01:18:11,373 --> 01:18:13,122
You're on fire tonight.

1576
01:18:13,124 --> 01:18:15,956
Let's get some more drinks.
Yeah. I'll get them. I'll get them.

1577
01:18:15,957 --> 01:18:19,622
Okay.

1578
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:24,581
Is it French?

1579
01:18:24,582 --> 01:18:26,122
Yes.

1580
01:18:26,123 --> 01:18:28,039
Can I have the definition, please?

1581
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:31,372
"To determine or
appoint beforehand."

1582
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:33,414
Can you use it in a sentence, please?

1583
01:18:33,415 --> 01:18:36,372
It is debated whether the events of our lives are

1584
01:18:36,373 --> 01:18:39,957
foreordained or the product of our own brain."

1585
01:18:43,957 --> 01:18:46,289
I don't want to go to Georgetown.

1586
01:18:46,290 --> 01:18:47,039
But all --

1587
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:49,831
don't... React.

1588
01:18:49,832 --> 01:18:51,372
Just feel.

1589
01:18:51,373 --> 01:18:52,372
Maybe I want to go. Maybe not.

1590
01:18:52,374 --> 01:18:55,622
It doesn't matter.
I'll go to a good school no matter what, but...

1591
01:18:55,623 --> 01:19:01,122
The only thing I know right now
is that I really like Gabrielle.

1592
01:19:01,123 --> 01:19:04,706
Like, a lot, and, uh...

1593
01:19:04,707 --> 01:19:09,372
Every time today plays out, I fuck it up.

1594
01:19:09,373 --> 01:19:11,206
And I'm not gonna let it happen again.

1595
01:19:11,207 --> 01:19:13,122
Gabrielle is my Georgetown.

1596
01:19:13,123 --> 01:19:16,997
I have no idea what that means, but I support you.

1597
01:19:19,207 --> 01:19:21,914
It's gonna be okay.

1598
01:19:21,915 --> 01:19:24,164
Can I have my headband back?

1599
01:19:24,165 --> 01:19:26,207
Yeah.

1600
01:19:34,998 --> 01:19:36,706
Looks better on you.

1601
01:19:36,707 --> 01:19:38,247
Thanks, Jack.

1602
01:19:38,248 --> 01:19:40,164
Let's go get that fucking girl!

1603
01:19:40,165 --> 01:19:41,247
Okeydoke.

1604
01:19:41,248 --> 01:19:43,332
Yeah.

1605
01:19:52,748 --> 01:19:55,457
Get in!

1606
01:19:57,123 --> 01:19:58,664
Can you drive?

1607
01:19:58,665 --> 01:19:59,456
Sure.

1608
01:19:59,458 --> 01:20:04,206
Okay. Why don't we get some fries, too?

1609
01:20:04,207 --> 01:20:05,997
Okay, so what do I do?

1610
01:20:05,998 --> 01:20:07,206
Well, it's too late to knock.

1611
01:20:07,207 --> 01:20:10,040
Which one is her window?

1612
01:20:11,790 --> 01:20:13,247
The light's still flickering.

1613
01:20:13,248 --> 01:20:14,706
Okay.

1614
01:20:14,707 --> 01:20:16,582
Yes!

1615
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:21,372
During your darkest time, why was there only one set of

1616
01:20:21,373 --> 01:20:23,998
footprints in the sand?

1617
01:20:24,873 --> 01:20:29,706
What? Because I
carried you, brother.

1618
01:20:29,707 --> 01:20:32,332
Get over here.

1619
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:35,957
What are we doing?

1620
01:20:36,873 --> 01:20:39,748
You're gonna need a boost.

1621
01:20:48,998 --> 01:20:49,956
What are you doing?

1622
01:20:49,957 --> 01:20:51,581
I need to talk to you.

1623
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:55,497
I didn't have sex with Angela.

1624
01:20:57,373 --> 01:20:58,289
N-o...

1625
01:20:58,291 --> 01:21:03,497
Did you hear me?
Yeah. You didn't bang the school slut. What a hero.

1626
01:21:03,498 --> 01:21:05,206
Get the fuck out of my room.

1627
01:21:05,207 --> 01:21:06,997
Gabs, come on.

1628
01:21:07,748 --> 01:21:10,540
Stop it, okay?

1629
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:16,539
Really?

1630
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:20,039
I'll buy you a new one.
Just... Listen, okay?

1631
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:23,289
When I woke up this morning,
I expected to be here tonight.

1632
01:21:23,290 --> 01:21:29,664
I mean, I couldn't imagine a scenario where I
wouldn't have been, but I lost sight of that.

1633
01:21:29,665 --> 01:21:33,081
But I'm here now, curse or no curse.

1634
01:21:33,082 --> 01:21:34,372
Rob!

1635
01:21:34,373 --> 01:21:36,289
How's it going up there?

1636
01:21:36,290 --> 01:21:37,747
Who's that?

1637
01:21:37,748 --> 01:21:39,956
That is my Georgetown interviewer.

1638
01:21:39,957 --> 01:21:44,373
Rob, how's it going?!
With the girl?!

1639
01:21:46,165 --> 01:21:47,206
What are they doing here?

1640
01:21:47,207 --> 01:21:49,206
We had a drink at the hotel.
Shit got deep.

1641
01:21:49,207 --> 01:21:50,997
Just listen, okay?

1642
01:21:50,998 --> 01:21:53,956
I thought that I had feelings for Angela.

1643
01:21:53,957 --> 01:21:55,039
Rob, leave.

1644
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:56,206
Well, just let me finish.
Angela isn't --

1645
01:21:56,207 --> 01:21:58,289
ugh! This isn't about Angela!

1646
01:21:58,290 --> 01:22:01,997
Just... Get out.

1647
01:22:01,998 --> 01:22:04,165
I'm not going anywhere.

1648
01:22:06,998 --> 01:22:09,706
Okay. Fine.

1649
01:22:09,707 --> 01:22:13,122
I can end this. I just
have to finish you off.

1650
01:22:13,123 --> 01:22:15,247
Then you're out of my room and you're back in yours.

1651
01:22:15,248 --> 01:22:15,956
Okay?

1652
01:22:15,957 --> 01:22:16,706
What?

1653
01:22:16,707 --> 01:22:17,372
Let's go. Come on.

1654
01:22:17,373 --> 01:22:18,414
Whoa! Don't... Do that.

1655
01:22:18,415 --> 01:22:19,581
Hey, whoa!
Hold on!

1656
01:22:19,582 --> 01:22:20,539
It'll be over really fast.

1657
01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:21,664
Gabs, seriously, stop!

1658
01:22:21,665 --> 01:22:22,789
Don't touch me!

1659
01:22:22,790 --> 01:22:24,039
'Cause that's not hurtful.

1660
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:26,539
Well, if you would just --
Gabrielle, what are you doing?!

1661
01:22:26,540 --> 01:22:28,039
Take off your pants so I can be alone!

1662
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:29,206
Gabrielle!

1663
01:22:29,207 --> 01:22:30,706
Oh, shit.

1664
01:22:30,707 --> 01:22:32,122
Hi, dad.

1665
01:22:32,123 --> 01:22:35,456
Oh, thank God, sir.

1666
01:22:35,457 --> 01:22:39,539
Please don't leave, because
your daughter --

1667
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:44,164
She was trying to take advantage
of me, and, uh... I just want to

1668
01:22:44,165 --> 01:22:49,706
assure you that I do not wish to do
anything physical with or to her.

1669
01:22:49,707 --> 01:22:52,872
Right now.

1670
01:22:52,873 --> 01:22:57,956
I'd feel a lot better about this if
you put your shirt back on... Dear.

1671
01:22:57,957 --> 01:23:00,456
Yeah. Sure. Here you go.

1672
01:23:02,665 --> 01:23:08,497
So... look, I'll leave, if that's what you want, but...

1673
01:23:08,498 --> 01:23:13,997
I just want to say, um...
I don't know what I'd do without you.

1674
01:23:13,998 --> 01:23:18,206
I mean, you're, like, the only way
that I can get through the day.

1675
01:23:18,207 --> 01:23:21,707
Every night before I go to sleep,
I check to see if you texted me.

1676
01:23:23,582 --> 01:23:26,997
I mean, you were the one who told me to
stop wearing white socks with black pants.

1677
01:23:26,998 --> 01:23:28,539
It's not a good look.

1678
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:32,289
You give me raisins in third period
so my blood sugar doesn't go low.

1679
01:23:32,290 --> 01:23:34,664
You don't eat properly.

1680
01:23:34,665 --> 01:23:36,872
You download hall and oates songs onto my phone.

1681
01:23:36,873 --> 01:23:38,872
That started as a joke, but now I like them.

1682
01:23:38,873 --> 01:23:40,372
Me too.

1683
01:23:40,373 --> 01:23:42,790
I love H&O.

1684
01:23:44,332 --> 01:23:49,622
Look, today has been terrible, Gabrielle,
each version of it, but it's been

1685
01:23:49,623 --> 01:23:54,956
worth it because today's the day I
finally realized how much I like you.

1686
01:23:54,957 --> 01:23:59,539
And now all I want to do is just sit...
Several feet away from

1687
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:02,956
you and watch the spelling bee.

1688
01:24:02,957 --> 01:24:06,497
But I obviously ruined all that, so...

1689
01:24:06,498 --> 01:24:12,707
I'm just going to leave the way I
came in and hope I get another shot.

1690
01:24:26,123 --> 01:24:27,206
Oh, shit.

1691
01:24:27,207 --> 01:24:32,039
So, um... you're at that age.

1692
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:34,747
You're gonna start having feelings.

1693
01:24:34,748 --> 01:24:36,664
Dad, I'd really be more comfortable
talking to mom about this.

1694
01:24:36,665 --> 01:24:38,039
Great. She'll be home later.

1695
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:40,414
Okay.

1696
01:24:40,415 --> 01:24:42,039
Okay, just go -- go
ahead and jump.

1697
01:24:42,041 --> 01:24:45,914
Just count to three and do it.
Yeah, but you're gonna want to tuck and roll when you hit.

1698
01:24:45,915 --> 01:24:49,289
Go for a break, not a sprain.
Heals faster.

1699
01:24:49,290 --> 01:24:53,997
That's reassuring.
Okay, three...

1700
01:24:53,998 --> 01:24:56,414
Two...

1701
01:24:56,415 --> 01:24:59,622
You want to watch the rest of the spelling bee?

1702
01:24:59,623 --> 01:25:01,914
Yeah.

1703
01:25:01,915 --> 01:25:03,664
Can you help me up now, please?

1704
01:25:03,665 --> 01:25:05,456
Yeah. Yes. I can.

1705
01:25:05,457 --> 01:25:06,539
Thank you.

1706
01:25:07,623 --> 01:25:09,706
What did I tell you?

1707
01:25:11,415 --> 01:25:13,081
Love is alive!

1708
01:25:17,748 --> 01:25:19,873
Use it in a sentence?

1709
01:25:29,415 --> 01:25:31,539
This one looks young.

1710
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:34,039
Yeah, yeah. It's his
first bee, so...

1711
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:35,956
Is the language of origin French?

1712
01:25:35,957 --> 01:25:37,956
Origin. That is a great stall.

1713
01:25:37,957 --> 01:25:40,539
Don't spell it till you know it.

1714
01:25:40,540 --> 01:25:43,456
Oh, no. He's imploding.

1715
01:25:43,457 --> 01:25:44,164
Can you hear me?

1716
01:25:44,165 --> 01:25:45,789
Oh, God. I can't watch.

1717
01:25:45,790 --> 01:25:46,997
Oh, don't be such a
pussy. Come on.

1718
01:25:46,998 --> 01:25:48,539
Mnh-mnh. Nope. I'm not
gonna watch it.

1719
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:50,414
Come on! Don't be s--
oh, wow!

1720
01:25:50,415 --> 01:25:52,956
No, okay, you know what?
That's really bad.

1721
01:25:52,957 --> 01:25:55,039
Unfortunately, you've gone

1722
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:56,747
over your allotted time.

1723
01:25:56,748 --> 01:25:58,873
You must leave the stage.

1724
01:26:00,707 --> 01:26:04,207
Does anyone know where his mother is?

1725
01:26:07,165 --> 01:26:10,539
I've liked you since we first met.

1726
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:11,539
When I had my lisp?

1727
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:12,622
Yes.

1728
01:26:14,707 --> 01:26:18,497
I was gonna tell you tonight,
and then I was hoping that the

1729
01:26:18,498 --> 01:26:22,372
beer would help and not make me burp.

1730
01:26:26,207 --> 01:26:29,207
I was always hoping we'd be each other's firsts.

1731
01:26:31,123 --> 01:26:32,748
Me too.

1732
01:26:42,957 --> 01:26:44,706
What do you think's going on in there?

1733
01:26:44,707 --> 01:26:49,581
I think... it feels
kind of weird.

1734
01:26:49,582 --> 01:26:52,957
Shush. Do you hear that?

1735
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:55,581
This feels awkward.

1736
01:26:55,582 --> 01:26:59,207
I feel -- I feel unusually
comfortable.

1737
01:27:02,332 --> 01:27:03,997
Okay.

1738
01:27:05,373 --> 01:27:06,706
Should we?

1739
01:27:06,707 --> 01:27:08,081
Yes.

1740
01:27:08,082 --> 01:27:11,081
I mean, like, now?

1741
01:27:11,082 --> 01:27:13,539
Okay, but you should know I
haven't had the best luck with --

1742
01:27:13,540 --> 01:27:17,623
Rob, just try and relax.

1743
01:27:18,207 --> 01:27:20,331
Oh. Oh, no. Oh, God.

1744
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:24,206
I -- I'm sorry. I'm --

1745
01:27:39,832 --> 01:27:44,872
Rob? What happened?

1746
01:27:44,873 --> 01:27:48,165
I mean, besides the obvious.

1747
01:27:49,623 --> 01:27:53,207
I'm not in my bed.

1748
01:27:53,790 --> 01:27:56,540
I'm in your bed.

1749
01:27:57,123 --> 01:28:00,206
And my mom's not here.

1750
01:28:00,207 --> 01:28:02,206
Do you need raisins?

1751
01:28:02,207 --> 01:28:07,872
No. I don't need anything.

1752
01:28:07,873 --> 01:28:11,540
I am right where I'm supposed to be.

1753
01:28:14,415 --> 01:28:15,622
You know what?

1754
01:28:15,623 --> 01:28:17,247
What?

1755
01:28:17,248 --> 01:28:19,331
We should have done something like this sooner.

1756
01:28:20,207 --> 01:28:22,372
I've always wanted to.

1757
01:28:25,207 --> 01:28:26,915
Let's try it again.

1758
01:28:34,373 --> 01:28:35,539
That is a wrap!

1759
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:37,706
We have a champion!

1760
01:28:37,707 --> 01:28:39,248
Yay!

1761
01:28:41,998 --> 01:28:44,331
<i> Take me to your best friend's house <i>

1762
01:28:44,332 --> 01:28:46,456
<i> goin' 'round this roundabout <i>

01:28:46,457 --> 01:28:50,747

1765

1766
01:28:54,915 --> 01:28:59,331

1767

<i> don't take me tongue tied <i>

1768
01:29:04,707 --> 01:29:08,456
so, why do you want to go to Georgetown?

1769
01:29:08,457 --> 01:29:10,039
George who?

1770
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:12,206
Smart. Beautiful.

1771
01:29:12,207 --> 01:29:14,831
You're exactly what Georgetown needs.

1772
01:29:14,832 --> 01:29:16,081
Are you married?

1773
01:29:16,082 --> 01:29:17,497
No. Not anymore.

1774
01:29:18,957 --> 01:29:20,247
My wife is dead.

1775
01:29:22,748 --> 01:29:24,664
<i> Normally we're making out <i>

1776
01:29:24,665 --> 01:29:28,539
<i> oh, yeah <i>

1777
01:29:28,540 --> 01:29:31,039
<i> oh, take me to your best friend's house <i>

1778
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:34,331
she curb-stomped my genitals.
With her shoes.

1779
01:29:34,332 --> 01:29:35,997
You should have punched her in the pussy.

1780
01:29:37,998 --> 01:29:39,539
Harder!

1781
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:41,956
Do it!

1782
01:29:41,957 --> 01:29:44,456
Give her a tit bruise!

1783
01:29:44,457 --> 01:29:46,331
Give her a tit bruise!

1784
01:29:46,332 --> 01:29:50,372
Squeeze her tit until milk comes out!

1785
01:29:50,373 --> 01:29:51,706
Hi, daddy.

1786
01:29:51,707 --> 01:29:53,039
Fucking --

1787
01:29:53,832 --> 01:29:55,664
No, I can do this.

1788
01:29:55,665 --> 01:29:57,206
Hi, daddy.

1789
01:29:57,207 --> 01:29:59,247
Welcome to my pu pu platter.

1790
01:30:00,457 --> 01:30:01,164
Fuck.

1791
01:30:01,165 --> 01:30:03,289
I'll do anything. Anything.

1792
01:30:03,290 --> 01:30:04,706
Put my finger in my butt and

1793
01:30:04,707 --> 01:30:05,706
make me pump it.

1794
01:30:05,707 --> 01:30:07,331
I help you jerk off.

1795
01:30:07,332 --> 01:30:08,706
I make you explode.

1796
01:30:08,707 --> 01:30:11,039
Do me doggie style and then

1797
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,372
we can eat dog.

1798
01:30:13,998 --> 01:30:15,456
I've had, like, 7 orgasms

1799
01:30:15,457 --> 01:30:17,831
so far today.

1800
01:30:17,832 --> 01:30:19,957
7?

1801
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:22,914
That's 3 more than me.

1802
01:30:22,915 --> 01:30:25,497
7?

1803
01:30:25,498 --> 01:30:27,372
You have to come to Georgetown.

1804
01:30:27,373 --> 01:30:30,497
You can make a lot of money,

1805
01:30:30,498 --> 01:30:31,206
young man.

1806
01:30:31,207 --> 01:30:33,206
That is so -- wow.

1807
01:30:33,873 --> 01:30:34,581
Is that selling it?

1808
01:30:43,373 --> 01:30:47,081
