2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,680
It's an assassination.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,190
Representative Kwon Young Choon
has disappeared.

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,140
Kidnapping
Representative Kwon Young Choon...

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,490
and killing the entire North Korean party.

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,950
This is terrorism
devised by the South Koreans!

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,380
I'll give you exactly
24 hours from now.

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,880
We don't have much time.
Where are you?

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,030
I followed the location of a cellphone
belonging to a smuggler.

10
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,580
- Yoo Gun.
- Put your gun down.

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,440
It's me, Soo Yun.

12
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,830
He didn't recognize me.

13
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,490
But it still doesn't change
the fact that he shot you.

14
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:48,050
If we run into him again,
I'll shoot him first.

15
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,160
The nuclear war in the Korean Peninsula...

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,340
Would you like to start a third world war?

17
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,930
Everyone knows that
your memory has returned.

18
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,310
Your name is Jung Yoo Gun.

19
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,300
The man who was captured
in the air-handling unit room CCTV...

20
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:18,680
and the man who shot you...

21
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,180
Was it Jung Yoo Gun?

22
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,000
Why the hell did you hide that fact?

23
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,030
<i>Episode 11</i>

24
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,470
Rie.

25
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,310
I told you not to get caught...

26
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,710
I told you to run away.

27
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,780
No!

28
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,570
It's nothing personal.

29
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,310
Get him out of my sight.

30
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,330
<i>What're you waiting for?</i>

31
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,760
Jung Yoo Gun!

32
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,320
<i>Take the shot.</i>

33
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,540
I'll make sure Yoo Joong Won
keeps quiet.

34
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,960
Until we know more,
let's keep this fact between us.

35
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,650
<i>Jung Yoo Gun.
Try to remember me.</i>

36
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,760
<i>- Jung Yoo Gun.
- What're you waiting for?</i>

37
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:42,890
<i>- Jung Yoo Gun!
- Take the shot.</i>

38
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,100
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

39
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,440
If I didn't do this...

40
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,880
you'd have just let it go without
letting anyone know about it.

41
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,440
What good is it to confuse the Team
about an unconfirmed situation?

42
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,590
I'm doing this after
I've finished investigating.

43
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,090
This voice recorded file...

44
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,280
we analyzed it in detail but there was
no tampering or editing of any kind.

45
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,630
Jung Yoo Gun...

46
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,970
He's neither your subordinate
nor an NSS agent anymore.

47
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,280
He's now just a terrorist
and an assassin.

48
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:37,840
As you've all heard,
no matter what the reason is...

49
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,720
Jung Yoo Gun is now an IRIS operative
and the assassin who killed Park Chul Young.

50
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:48,630
Who knows...
what he's been doing while he was gone.

51
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:55,310
I understand Team Leader Ji
encountered IRIS operatives in Busan.

52
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:58,260
Was Jung Yoo Gun there among them?

53
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,950
- If you don't answer now...
- Yes.

54
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,710
Team Leader Jung Yoo Gun...
I saw him there.

55
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,640
But he didn't seem to
recognize me at all.

56
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,880
So what is it that you want to say?

57
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,880
Yoo Gun. It's me.

58
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,220
It's me, Soo Yun.

59
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,170
Don't you recognize me?

60
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,140
I'm saying that...

61
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,790
he might have lost his memory
due his gunshot wound.

62
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,000
Yes, that could be.

63
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,880
With a sudden loss of memory,
it could cause a change in personality.

64
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,590
- Section Chief Oh.
- Yes.

65
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,610
Didn't you say Jung Yoo Gun
was mostly likely dead?

66
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,180
Ah... well... the situation...

67
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:12,400
From this moment on,
whoever assists Jung Yoo Gun in secret...

68
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,830
that person will be considered a part of the
terrorist ring and be investigated.

69
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:27,570
And... Jung Yoo Gun disappeared in the
middle of the Baek San transport mission.

70
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:31,890
You're going to have to take
the responsibility for that.

71
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,670
Did he really shoot you?

72
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,820
Team Leader Jung did?

73
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,150
Let's talk about this later.

74
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,240
Later when?

75
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,690
If it was really Team Leader Jung
who shot Team Leader Ji...

76
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,580
and he's the one who killed
Park Chul Young...

77
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,000
this is a serious matter.

78
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,450
I can't believe it.

79
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,280
How could this be?

80
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,810
This isn't a matter of whether
it could or couldn't be.

81
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,320
Even if he was being used...

82
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,970
it doesn't change the fact that
he's a murderer and a terrorist.

83
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,700
They were using him because
he lost his memory.

84
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,320
He didn't recognize me at all.

85
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,830
It's not just anyone but
it's Team Leader Jung.

86
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,240
Don't talk so lightly about him.

87
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,270
Hey, look at this!

88
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,950
<i>I'm sure you know who this is.</i>

89
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,840
<i>These are our terms.</i>

90
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,020
<i>It's simple.</i>

91
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:07,730
<i>Give us Baek San and
we'll hand over Jung Yoo Gun.</i>

92
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,740
<i>We pick the time and location.</i>

93
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:19,740
<i>If you accept our offer, IRIS will cease
all terrorist attacks on the Korean Peninsula.</i>

94
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,260
<i>But if you choose not to...</i>

95
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:29,340
<i>Jung Yoo Gun will be delivered
back to you in a body bag.</i>

96
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:36,410
<i>And we will unleash a reign of terror...
one you cannot possibly imagine.</i>

97
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,790
<i>You have one day to decide.</i>

98
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,250
<i>I'm a man of my word.</i>

99
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,140
Section Chief.

100
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,800
When did you receive that video file?

101
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,420
Just a moment ago.

102
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,890
I tried to trace back the origin
but I failed.

103
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,400
Did you send it to the Deputy Director?

104
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,980
The Director and the Deputy Director...
I sent it to them all.

105
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,000
What do you think?

106
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:51,950
Do you think your friends will
give up Baek San to save you?

107
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:00,450
Perhaps they'll ignore the one
who shot their colleague?

108
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,190
Ji Soo Yun.

109
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,580
That's the name of
the person you shot.

110
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:22,910
She pursued me with you in Hungary.
She was one of your closest colleagues.

111
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,400
Perhaps you two were lovers?

112
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,390
Yesterday's friend became
today's enemy.

113
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,780
I wonder what will happen tomorrow.

114
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,420
I don't know what
you want from Baek San...

115
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:05,550
but the NSS will never
trade Baek San for me.

116
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,740
I don't think so either.

117
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:14,550
Unless they're stupid, why would they try
to rescue someone who's betrayed the NSS?

118
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:22,630
But it doesn't matter to me whether
they'll trade Baek San for you or not.

119
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,280
He remembers everything.

120
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,840
In that case...
we should kill him at the exchange.

121
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,230
Are you worried about
keeping him alive?

122
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,690
I've watched him for almost
a year now.

123
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,870
If he wants to get back at us...

124
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,880
I know what he's capable of.

125
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,950
You do not want
Jung Yoo Gun as your enemy.

126
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,810
My son came to visit his mother
and brought a big present.

127
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,330
- I'm not going to eat her.
- Bring all of them to me.

128
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,160
I'm going to ask you from the beginning.

129
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,080
I'm not going to lose those
who are precious to me anymore.

130
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:43,150
There is one thing I'm sure of.

131
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,850
If someone died by my hands...

132
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,130
that was absolutely necessary
for this country.

133
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,380
Show this video to Yoo Joong Won also.

134
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,400
If he wants to meet,
find a place for us to meet outside.

135
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:22,180
Act like we're cooperating with
them in finding Representative Kwon.

136
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:28,520
I'm sure Yoo Joong Won will be against
trading Baek San and Team Leader Jung.

137
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,400
The one Yoo Joong Won really
wants is probably Baek San.

138
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,990
I'm also against it.

139
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,180
Considering what happened so far...

140
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,990
there's no doubt Team Leader Jung was involved
in the assassination of the North Korean party.

141
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:45,300
He's a subject we need to arrest
and interrogate.

142
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,500
We don't want to exchange someone
as important as Baek San with him.

143
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,910
Wasn't the one who shot
you, Team Leader Jung?

144
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:59,210
If that's true, that means
he's our enemy now.

145
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:02,680
And he's very dangerous
as our enemy.

146
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,140
You'd better be careful.

147
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,610
But he's their hostage now.
How do you explain that?

148
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,680
We'll know soon enough.

149
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,850
<i>You have one day to decide.</i>

150
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,650
Would you be able to
connect me to Mr. Black?

151
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,310
There is no way to get in touch
with him from our end.

152
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,230
It might be possible through Japan.

153
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,530
Fine. I'll be waiting.

154
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,030
I sent the list of information
we need to get from the NSS.

155
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,760
I've confirmed it.

156
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:42,750
If we want to find out
what Choi Min got out of Baek San...

157
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:46,380
we may have to extract all of the
top classified information from the NSS.

158
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,630
Even if it takes time,
we must do it.

159
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:52,600
Also find the exact location.

160
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,920
Okay.

161
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,520
Are you sure it was
really Team Leader Jung?

162
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
I confirmed it with my own eyes.

163
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,260
But it appeared there was
some kind of problem.

164
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,620
He didn't even seem
to know who he was.

165
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:16,220
You shouldn't call a terrorist
'Team Leader Jung' now.

166
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,410
For a little while...

167
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,910
he must've had an issue
with his memory.

168
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,200
Team Leader Ji.

169
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,030
Getting worked up isn't
going to help the situation.

170
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,790
He kidnapped
Representative Kwon Young Choon.

171
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,650
And killed the entire North Korean party.

172
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,380
To exchange Baek San with someone
like that doesn't make any sense.

173
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,280
What if the North starts to fuss
again about launching a missile or...

174
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,010
That won't happen.

175
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,610
I'm speaking as the one
with full authority.

176
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:56,970
I'm all for exchanging
Baek San for Jung Yoo Gun.

177
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,280
I don't understand.

178
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:06,180
Assassinating your own representatives
and willing to go to war with us...

179
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,090
yet, you're willing to rescue
that terrorist?

180
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:13,110
We're not rescuing but...
extraditing the culprit.

181
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,530
We need to get him and
find out who's behind this.

182
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,960
Also we need to confirm whether
Representative Kwon is alive.

183
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:25,090
But we can't hand over
Baek San no matter what.

184
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,160
Why not?

185
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:34,380
I thought you got everything
out of Baek San already?

186
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:02,370
Bluffing... so you were
completely full of it.

187
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:06,460
Since you didn't get anything
out of Baek San...

188
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,670
you can't hand him over
to them, just yet.

189
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:14,240
Even if Jung Yoo Gun
comes back in a body bag.

190
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:39,380
The reason why IRIS is after Baek San.

191
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,830
Why is that?

192
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,380
Deputy Director.

193
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,590
As Yoo Joong Won said...

194
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:53,310
in order to make him stop launching
the missile, I tricked him a little.

195
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:00,190
Do you want to see Team Leader Jung
come back alive?

196
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:05,680
Then find out a way to rescue
Yoo Gun without giving up Baek San.

197
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,130
Otherwise there'll be no other
way to rescue him.

198
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,930
Let me see you for a second.

199
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,080
This is Ui Sang Chul's address
that you asked for.

200
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,610
You found it?

201
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:52,780
It was difficult.

202
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:56,160
His information was completely protected
as if in a witness protection program.

203
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,090
- Thank you.
- Sure.

204
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,040
- Did everything go okay?
- No.

205
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,440
Then what do we do now?

206
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,390
There isn't much time left.

207
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,780
Since they want something from us...

208
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:13,220
they won't harm Team Leader Jung
that easily, I hope.

209
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:18,550
I should be the one consoling but...

210
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,580
you seem much more optimistic.

211
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,170
It must be something very important.

212
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,450
Please go ahead and tell me.

213
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,290
We need further confirmation but...

214
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:40,620
Baek San revealed to me
what he's been hiding.

215
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,580
What was it?

216
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,840
There are five nuclear weapons which were
completed during the 4th administration.

217
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,720
This is no joke.

218
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:59,160
We do need to look into this further,
but he didn't seem like he was lying.

219
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:03,430
Are you saying that there are five nuclear
weapons hidden somewhere in this country?

220
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,630
Yes.

221
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,610
It appears the terrorists were
continuously attacking us...

222
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:12,550
in order to get that
information from Baek San.

223
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,960
Who else knows about this?

224
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,980
Up until this point, you, me and...

225
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,890
Yoo Joong Won are the
only ones who know about this.

226
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,530
Who are you?

227
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:20,640
By any chance...
do you live here?

228
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:24,270
Since you ask me plainly showing
that you are an investigator...

229
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,310
even if I do, I want to say no.

230
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,210
Exactly which agency are you from?

231
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,260
I'm Ji Soo Yun from the NSS.

232
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,650
Why is the NSS looking for me?

233
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:12,370
Do you recognize them?

234
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:18,170
It's been a long time.

235
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,840
Of course, I recognize them.

236
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,390
This is Yoo Sang Joon.

237
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:28,810
Is it true that Baek San
killed Yoo Sang Joon?

238
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,750
Where did you get this picture?

239
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,820
I got it from this woman
in the picture.

240
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,900
What about Sang Joon?

241
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,210
How many times do I have to tell you?

242
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:55,200
Your child's father
Yoo Sang Joon is dead.

243
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,510
You've done a lot of investigation.

244
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,810
But you put the first button in wrong.

245
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,300
Why are you trying to reveal this
now after all this time?

246
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:11,250
I hope you understand that
I can't tell you the details.

247
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,470
It's just that...

248
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,850
Her son, Jung Yoo Gun, disappeared...

249
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:20,100
in the midst of investigating
the secret behind his family.

250
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,810
Are you Yoo Gun's lover?

251
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,470
Please tell me.

252
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:32,910
Who killed Yoo Sang Joon?

253
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,150
Baek San killed this guy.

254
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,810
That's correct.

255
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,400
I told him to.

256
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,870
But his name isn't Yoo Sang Joon.

257
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,950
His name is Kim Jung Yong.

258
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:52,600
He was a CIA spy hiding in the
Central Intelligence Service.

259
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,850
I couldn't be sure but...

260
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:02,770
Ji Young and Baek San, they
probably think each other is dead.

261
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:08,020
Their era had shattered their fate.

262
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,690
A few years ago...

263
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:15,990
I wouldn't have talked about this
even if I were to get beaten to death.

264
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:23,010
There's something bad
growing inside my body.

265
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,110
They say I only have
several months to live.

266
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,830
That's why I'm telling you everything.

267
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,110
Who cares now.

268
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:35,130
Once I die, that'll be the end of it.

269
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,670
Then... who is Yoo Sang Joon?

270
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,590
This is him right here.

271
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,240
But isn't that...

272
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:51,000
Baek San?

273
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:56,560
Yoo Sang Joon changed his
identity to Baek San.

274
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:03,530
Jung Soo Min changed
her identity to Jung Ji Young.

275
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:09,600
At the time, that's what I did
for their protection.

276
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:17,780
Go tell Jung Ji Young and Baek San...

277
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:20,890
that I am sorry.

278
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,150
And tell that to the son also.

279
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:36,910
Jung Yoo Gun.
So he was alive.

280
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,420
It's good to hear that he's alive but...

281
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:45,570
I don't want to go along with
that kind of hostage exchange deal.

282
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:47,660
I feel the same way.

283
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:50,130
We don't want to
negotiate with the terrorists.

284
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,080
But instead...

285
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,990
you'll have to keep
the promise you made last time.

286
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:00,540
I informed the President about
the nuclear arms.

287
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,810
If we can go alone...

288
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:06,990
you promised to help me confirm
the existence of the nuclear arms.

289
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,920
I'll set a date soon.

290
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,880
I'll be waiting.

291
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,230
Enjoy.

292
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:30,750
Thank you.

293
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,190
Captain, do you think
they'll agree to the exchange?

294
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,980
We have to make that happen.

295
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,400
Yes, Captain.

296
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,350
How is it going there?

297
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,260
I'm sending it simultaneously
as I'm downloading it.

298
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:23,350
It's all of the NSS's top
classified information.

299
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:29,890
If Choi Min has recorded the
information from Baek San somewhere...

300
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:32,050
it'll probably be in the
top classified file.

301
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,870
The duration of download is?

302
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,080
It'll be finished in two hours.

303
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,300
What about the team?

304
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,840
They're already on standby.

305
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,510
Good work.
I'll be in touch again.

306
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,050
The server condition seems
a little weird.

307
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,400
Why?

308
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:18,980
I think someone's accessing
the server from the outside.

309
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,300
Since when?

310
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,690
I'll find out.

311
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,600
It's already accessed the classified files.

312
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:33,510
- Notify the Team Leader.
- Got it.

313
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:20,630
What's going on?

314
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,430
Someone has accessed our main server.

315
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:23,630
Block the access, now.

316
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,020
If you do that, we can't retrieve
whatever information downloaded so far.

317
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,610
We can reversely infect
their file with a virus.

318
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,140
A reverse hacking?

319
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,600
It's little dangerous...

320
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,720
but if we want to destroy what
they have, that's the only way.

321
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:38,330
It's too dangerous.

322
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:41,160
If you fail, you know
what will happen, right?

323
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:44,170
We won't fail.
We just need five minutes.

324
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:53,060
Have you found out who he is?

325
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,150
Yes.

326
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,470
Do you still want me to...

327
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:06,100
Yes, I want you to continue to
keep this a secret.

328
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,670
We did it.

329
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,370
Okay, block the download.

330
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,740
The installation is complete.

331
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,810
Wait a minute.

332
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:57,030
- I found the location.
- Where is it?

333
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:58,580
It's the next building.

334
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,650
I think the hacker directly connected
to us through a cable line.

335
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:02,860
Mi Jin, send field agents to the
communication room in the next building.

336
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:03,870
Yes.

337
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:54,720
<i>If you give us Baek San,
we hand over Jung Yoo Gun to you. </i>

338
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,350
I heard it from the Deputy Director.

339
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:04,690
So IRIS indeed wants to trade
me and Jung Yoo Gun.

340
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:09,450
The Deputy Director and the NSS
are against the exchange...

341
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:15,120
but if you agree to it,
I'll try to do what I can.

342
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,740
Why... should I agree to it?

343
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,800
Because...

344
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:29,270
Then... who is Yoo Sang Joon?

345
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,230
This is him right here.

346
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,410
But isn't that...

347
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,260
Baek San?

348
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,590
Yoo Sang Joon changed
his identity to Baek San.

349
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:46,480
Jung Soo Min... changed
her identity to Jung Ji Young.

350
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:49,020
I don't want to believe it but...

351
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:58,310
it's because Jung Yoo Gun's
father is... you.

352
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:04,830
What are you... talking about?

353
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:08,740
Baek San and Yoo Sang Joon...

354
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:14,240
I know that they are the same person.

355
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,750
You said that Ui Sang Chul is still alive.

356
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,570
Did you go see him?

357
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:25,310
Yes.

358
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:29,640
Did you hear anything else
from him?

359
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,130
You mean about Jung Soo Min?

360
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:37,950
Is she still alive?

361
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:40,850
Yes, she's still alive.

362
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:46,550
Once everything is finished,
I'll arrange for you to meet her.

363
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:53,980
Tell me everything you heard
from Ui Sang Chul.

364
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:57,550
Then I'll agree to your deal.

365
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:59,570
But I do have a condition.

366
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:05,820
Let me plan the exchange mission.

367
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,670
I was like you before.

368
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:27,610
It's really strange.

369
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:32,740
You have this unusual power
to make me talk about things...

370
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:35,540
that I've never talked about
with anyone until now.

371
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:45,670
What?

372
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:48,570
Are you sure they didn't
get anything out of us?

373
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:50,710
Okay.

374
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:56,650
Ji Soo Yun.

375
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:57,950
Yes, Deputy Director.

376
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,710
How did you convince Baek San?

377
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:07,920
By any chance, did you offer him
a deal that I don't know about?

378
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,330
There is nothing like that.

379
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:15,240
If this exchange mission fails...

380
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:19,930
you and I both will be camping
out in an interrogation room.

381
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,680
I'll definitely make
the mission successful.

382
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:30,550
Fine. Tell Team Leader Oh about
the time and place for the exchange.

383
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:33,140
Reply to where the video
was sent from.

384
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:35,050
Start the operation as planned.

385
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:39,230
Yes, I understand.

386
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:51,660
Yoo Gun doesn't know that Baek San
and Yoo Sang Joon are the same person.

387
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:54,740
He seems to think that Baek San
is the one who killed his father.

388
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,230
You must have something to say to me.

389
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:07,400
Your life is also...

390
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:09,960
pretty pathetic.

391
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:13,700
It's twisted as much as it could be.

392
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,520
You're just like me.

393
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:22,790
No.

394
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,840
I'm different than you.

395
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:33,870
I didn't get used knowing
that I was being used.

396
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:43,190
I was used by you people while
my memory was compromised.

397
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:47,900
Your mind is completely intact...

398
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:51,310
and yet, you're still getting used by the
one you should be taking revenge against.

399
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:56,040
What are you talking about?

400
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,320
If you're talking rubbish,
I'm going to kill you.

401
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:05,440
You seem like you didn't know.

402
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:15,970
When I handed you over
to Park Chul Young...

403
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,660
someone tried to kill you.

404
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:23,850
I wonder who ordered to
have you killed?

405
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:30,760
I'm sure it was Rey.

406
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,830
We met because we needed each other.

407
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:36,840
And will use each other
as long as we need one another.

408
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:41,230
That's good that you knew.

409
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:45,200
But it's a little odd.

410
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:51,630
You joined IRIS in order to take
revenge against the North Korean military.

411
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:53,550
But now...

412
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:57,700
you've allied yourself with the North Korean
military hard-liners involved in terrorism.

413
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,350
Kim Yun Hwa.

414
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:06,840
I wonder what made you
change your mind?

415
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,310
Keep your mouth shut.

416
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:38,850
Don't you remember why
I joined IRIS?

417
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:41,840
Yeah, and you got your
revenge in Hungary.

418
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:44,610
It's not over.

419
00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:46,190
It's only the beginning.

420
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,210
There is nothing I can do.

421
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:50,320
It's Mr. Black's orders.

422
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:54,680
I don't care.

423
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:02,390
Calm down.

424
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:39,770
The NSS has decided
to trade Baek San for you.

425
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,210
You must be wondering...

426
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,830
why do we want him so bad?

427
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:55,800
Why go through all the trouble?

428
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:01,010
Well, since you'll be dead soon...

429
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:04,200
I'll let you in on a little secret.

430
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:09,150
Hidden beneath Seoul are
five nuclear weapons.

431
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:12,970
And Baek San is the one
who hid them.

432
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,670
And once we get a hold of them...

433
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:19,070
we're going to detonate one
in Pyongyang.

434
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:20,710
And the other one...

435
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,420
Seoul.

436
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,080
Hey, Rey.

437
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,900
Listen to me.

438
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:37,520
You cannot do it because...

439
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:43,040
I'm going to kill you with
my own hands.

440
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,690
We'll see about that.

441
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:03,760
Two here and the
two additional snipers there.

442
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,250
Below the point, we'll have two
special scuba divers on standby.

443
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:09,980
As soon as we exchange Baek San
with Team Leader Jung...

444
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:12,030
Baek San will immediately
jump into the ocean.

445
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:15,650
At the same time, the snipers and
the operation team will start the shooting.

446
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,490
We'll then begin arresting the culprits.

447
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,810
After Baek San jumps into the ocean?

448
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:22,850
The scuba divers on standby underwater
will assist him to point X.

449
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:25,360
The mission plan doesn't
sound so bad but...

450
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:30,390
I heard Baek San devised the plan.

451
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:32,060
Yes.

452
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:34,420
I'm against it.

453
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:37,950
We still don't know what
Baek San has in store for us.

454
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:41,250
If the mission fails,
who's going to take the responsibility?

455
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:42,650
I will.

456
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:47,480
Everyone in this room probably knows
Baek San has no intention of rejoining IRIS.

457
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:51,380
If he did, he wouldn't have
surrendered to us in the first place.

458
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:54,810
I'm certain that he still wants
to be under our protection.

459
00:51:55,640 --> 00:52:00,570
Since you are so confident...
we'll trust you this time.

460
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:02,810
But if the mission goes wrong...

461
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:05,230
you'll definitely have to
bear the consequences.

462
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:09,120
Have Yoo Joong Won
come to the exchange as well.

463
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:11,490
So that he can't say anything later.

464
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,110
Understood.

465
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:24,970
You're still up.

466
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:27,930
I can't sleep.

467
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,770
How about some wine?

468
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,130
You read my mind.

469
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:45,430
I'm sorry, Rey.

470
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,360
I was being too sensitive.

471
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,650
It's okay.
It happens.

472
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:48,860
When I handed you over to
Park Chul Young in Hungary...

473
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:52,630
someone tried to kill you.

474
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:56,610
I wonder who ordered to
have you killed?

475
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:00,930
You won't hear anything from me.

476
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:04,030
And...

477
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:22,710
those who ally with the
People's Republic are all my enemies.

478
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:06,150
Are you crazy?

479
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,730
What the hell are you doing?

480
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,230
Rey! Rey!

481
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:05,480
Sir! Are you okay, Sir?

482
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:12,180
- Don't let her get away.
- Yes, sir.

483
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,340
Get ready.

484
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:52,940
Yes, Sir.

485
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:57,240
Get ready.

486
00:58:02,970 --> 00:58:05,600
Captain Yoo Joong Won has
arrived at the guest point.

487
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:24,510
SP1 ready.

488
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,880
At 11:23 am,
the sniper set up was complete.

489
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,710
The target will approach from 11 o'clock.

490
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:32,260
What about the rescue divers?

491
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,920
After inspecting for
any underwater hazards...

492
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,410
they've been on standby
for about an hour.

493
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:36,460
Okay.

494
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:41,950
Are you ready?

495
01:00:42,590 --> 01:00:46,040
The question is...
are you ready?

496
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:49,850
We'll make the exchange at
12 o'clock sharp.

497
01:00:53,970 --> 01:00:57,140
It's 30 seconds before 12.

Were you able to find a trace
of Baek San?

500
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:07,920
I'm sorry. We'll try to
find him as soon as possible.

501
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:10,500
When did your memory return?

502
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:14,570
Was it before or after you shot Soo Yun?

503
01:02:15,010 --> 01:02:18,000
Thank you for coming back.

504
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,090
The Chairman of the National
Defense Commission has

505
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:22,970
ordered our immediate
return to the Republic.

506
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:24,730
We have to rush our operation.

507
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:26,570
Find out more about this woman.

508
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:29,840
We're discovered.

509
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:32,770
What the hell is your deal?

510
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:36,930
I'm going to kill whoever allies
with the North Korean hard-liners.

511
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:38,030
Let's take revenge together.

512
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:41,910
Yoo Joong Won and
IRIS have another plan.

513
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:43,660
We'll need to find Baek San
as soon as possible.

514
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:46,780
If Yoo Joong Won finds Baek San
before us...

515
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:49,650
something unimaginable could happen.

516
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:51,980
Mr. Black will try to form a
new group of operatives.

517
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:53,620
Help me get in touch with him.

518
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:59,030
Move in the shadows and find
Baek San and Yoo Joong Won.
