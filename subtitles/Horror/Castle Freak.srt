1
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,589
Giorgio.

2
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,549
Why do you roll so quickly?

3
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,750
I don't roll so quickly that that.

4
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,628
Is it again far?

5
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,153
No, watch,

6
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,471
"Castello "Orsino di.

7
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,949
Like what does he/it look?

8
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,473
He/it is on a hill,
as in a fairy tale.

9
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,752
No, he/it is cold,
you are going to catch a cold.

10
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,194
When I received your letter,

11
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,317
I believed in a swindle.

12
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,230
Forgiveness?

13
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,037
I have difficulty believing
that I inherit a castle.

14
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,754
That way, lady, miss.

15
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,159
What, mom, is there?

16
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,992
Nothing, but make attention
where you walk.

17
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,516
This part has been constructed
700 years ago.

18
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,314
Welcome in the Castle Reilly,
ladies.

19
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,072
He/it is cold, mom.

20
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,432
Are the rooms ready?

21
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,397
Of course. Follow me.

22
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,079
How John can be him related
of a duchess?

23
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,674
I called on a deprived detective

24
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,400
and one recovered you, M. Reilly.

25
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,438
You are the son of fire
the duchess's s.ur,

26
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,955
the last of the Orsini lineage.

27
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,157
Dad, I believe
that he/it says that you are duke!

28
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,552
Yes, your father
is the heir legitimizes the title,

29
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,474
of the castle and all goods
that this one contains.

30
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,199
I fear that the family
lost his/her/its fortune

31
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,634
during the war.

32
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,113
There is not any money therefore.

33
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,670
M. giannetti.

34
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,949
In how long can liquidate one

35
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,189
goods of the domain?

36
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,509
Do you want to sell?

37
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,428
Yes, all. As soon as possible.

38
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,517
How much is the domain worth?

39
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,193
Difficult to say,

40
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,319
only the duchess lived
the castle, these last 40 years.

41
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,398
The Americans are there.

42
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,793
Here is my s.ur Agnese.
She/it will make the kitchen and the household.

43
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,077
Hello, I am called John Reilly.
Here is my wife Susan

44
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,468
and my daughter Rebecca.

45
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,389
Your room is there
and the one of your daughter nearby.

46
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,629
Your mother and you

47
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,357
are the "signora"
and the "signorina" of the "Castello."

48
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,078
I am the housekeeper.

49
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,436
One has work
if you want to sell,

50
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,638
he/it is going to be necessary us
a list of goods.

51
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,550
- An inventory?
- Precisely.

52
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,798
I must speak of it
to realtors.

53
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,035
Sorry, I spin.

54
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,990
Do you sleep to the castle, Agnese?

55
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,357
Yes, I have a room
close to the kitchen.

56
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,679
You will be able to prepare
another room?

57
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,072
Do you wait for someone?

58
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,673
It is for my husband.

59
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,595
I will prepare another room.

60
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,912
To the menu tonight,
it is spaghettis bolognaises.

61
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,075
It is perfected, thank you very much.

62
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,237
You remain a short time
to the castello?

63
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,995
Do you sell and do you leave?

64
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,110
Soon?

65
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,271
When all will be adjusted.

66
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,633
It is well.

67
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,349
You sell and you leave.

68
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,509
Soon.

69
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,235
Who is it?

70
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,750
It is I.

71
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,799
What do you want?

72
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,276
It is our first night here,
I told to me

73
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,473
that one could start again to zero.

74
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,758
I was going to lie down,
I took my soporific.

75
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,913
I am going to wake you up,
Beautiful to the sleeping wood.

76
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,838
You are so beautiful...

77
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,028
John, please...

78
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,156
I, Suzie, miss you.

79
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,596
I miss you so!

80
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,755
Stop!

81
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,514
For God's love,
that makes 9 months that I didn't drink!

82
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,875
You were adorable,
I should forgive you.

83
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,759
I would like indeed
but I don't arrive there!

84
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,798
Then, why did you come here?

85
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,639
She/it sleeps nearby!

86
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,874
Excuse me.

87
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,192
Good, I am going to lie down.

88
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,437
One should stop and should wait.

89
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,317
I told your mother
that I will bring you back

90
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,708
home to dine.

91
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,313
One is already late.

92
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,273
Does that go, behind, JJ?

93
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,430
Yes.

94
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,711
- Sit you!
- I have it.

95
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,792
Sit you, I tell you!

96
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,916
Dad!

97
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,350
Becky?

98
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,869
JJ?

99
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,749
JJ?

100
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,470
Do I can you to help?

101
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,995
No-thank you, I am I just coupe.

102
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,753
In full night?

103
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,593
I fell
while looking for the toilets.

104
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,674
You were awake
by something?

105
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,632
Why, that is your case?

106
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,794
The old people sleep little.

107
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,560
- You also, you heard it?
- What?

108
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,678
The moan.
As a child who cries.

109
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,389
My brother...

110
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,437
he/it didn't tell you

111
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,716
history?

112
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,678
Thank you, I don't drink.

113
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:00,757
Which?

114
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,950
The duchess had a son.

115
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,873
Giorgio.

116
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,358
The "beautiful child."

117
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,717
Why didn't he/it inherit?

118
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,156
He/it died

119
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,714
at the age of 5 years.

120
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,757
5 years? Of what did he/it die?

121
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,159
No one knows.

122
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,192
The duchess's husband...

123
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,753
she/it had married an American
during the war,

124
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,749
he/it abandoned them,
her and the small boy.

125
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,359
A short time after,
Giorgio was buried.

126
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,110
Then, the duchess dismissed
everybody

127
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,677
and lived alone.

128
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,438
She/it didn't leave the castle

129
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,956
during 42 years!

130
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,917
Until his/her/its death.

131
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,150
To lose a child makes if pain...

132
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,192
And one feels guilty.

133
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,279
When the American left it,

134
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,354
the duchess became "pazza."..
Madwoman.

135
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,992
People of the city say
that she/it took vengeance

136
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,878
while killing the child.

137
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,038
Lord...
it was also his/her/its child.

138
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,756
It is contrary to the nature,
contrary to God.

139
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,791
Why do you tell me all that?

140
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,918
People of the city also say

141
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,672
that the night,
when the streets are desolate,

142
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,759
one hears Giorgio... he/it cries.

143
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,833
A child who cries...

144
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,353
They say

145
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,952
that the castle is haunted.

146
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,993
The book is green.

147
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,313
The lake is blue.

148
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,358
The flower is red.

149
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,916
My love, does that go? What is there?

150
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,230
That goes. I assure you.

151
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,432
What is it as flowers?

152
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,711
I don't know, I picked them
around the castle.

153
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,595
Ladies, I am going to begin
the inventory of the treasure.

154
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,796
You accompany me
for a small visit?

155
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,635
It is not recommended.

156
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,712
One remains to this floor.
Go, one goes there.

157
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,832
Hold. Pay attention.

158
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,833
Doesn't worry you for me,
one is going to have fun.

159
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,429
What?

160
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,875
A room filled of toys...

161
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,111
It is a nursery, I believe.

162
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,348
Approach, Beck.

163
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,835
What is it?

164
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,712
A horse... a rocking horse!

165
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,277
What?

166
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,399
Let's sit ourselves on this bed. There.

167
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,151
During that time,
I look for the treasure.

168
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,113
One would say that someone lived here.

169
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,795
If you were duchess,

170
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,509
where is that
what you would hide your jewelry?

171
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,394
I don't know.

172
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,028
Under the bed?

173
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,909
Why not...

174
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,312
One can always watch.

175
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,749
Is he/it there?

176
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,788
No, my love.

177
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,958
There is not anything. Just...

178
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,469
of the oldies.

179
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,118
Let's continue to look for.

180
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,198
Don't get along like a scratching?

181
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,234
Beck, one second.
I look at some things.

182
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,509
Hello, pussycat.

183
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,994
Where are you, pussycat?

184
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,315
Do you go where?

185
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,235
What do you want?

186
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,755
Where do you go, nasty cat?

187
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,154
That is sufficient, one goes back up, now.

188
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,630
Wait!

189
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,668
What is there below of so important?

190
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,196
Leave me! Go see elsewhere!

191
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,035
My God...

192
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,277
It is necessary that I come out of here.

193
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,197
A someone there?

194
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,676
Is it you, imbecile of cat?

195
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,434
Is there someone?

196
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,759
Come there, pussycat!

197
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,278
Come there, pussycat.

198
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,238
Pussycat, come, I leave.

199
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,113
I am there, dad!

200
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,639
Dad, I arrive!

201
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,559
Where did you have passed?
I heard your father to call you!

202
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,630
There is someone here!

203
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,313
What? What happened?

204
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,836
I opened a door
and I followed the cat below.

205
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,639
Are you silly or what?
You could have wounded yourself!

206
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,869
In fact, me...

207
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,519
But you are wounded.

208
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,190
Just a cut. It is anything.

209
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,556
- Where did you have passed?
- She/it got injured because of you.

210
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,678
What did you make?
She/it was with me.

211
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,875
What excuse do you have this time?

212
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,393
One is not going to kick it!

213
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,232
Can you supervise it, no?

214
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,391
Listen! There is someone here!

215
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,150
Rebecca, promise me
of more to make that ever.

216
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,754
To walk me
as someone normal?

217
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,312
If you want to visit the castle
or the city,

218
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,675
say-the-I and I will accompany you.

219
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,352
Mom, it is my handicap!

220
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,031
It is my challenge,
I must manage all alone.

221
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,316
And you manage well.
Excuse me.

222
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,153
- You don't have any friends here...
- A friend would believe me!

223
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,390
Listen to me,
there is someone here.

224
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,471
Enough spoken of that.
Go,

225
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,437
put your glasses, one is going to eat lunch.

226
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,430
My love, I want that you know
that I am your friend

227
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,115
and that I will always be there
for you.

228
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,716
Only, you make yourself the ideas

229
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,031
because you would like to have
a friend here.

230
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,670
Is there a cat here, Agnese?

231
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,549
No, but Gabriela
adored the cats.

232
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,598
Gabriela... was it the duchess?

233
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,394
Did you know it?

234
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:03,792
Yes, I was domestic
when she/it was teenage.

235
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,154
How was she/it?

236
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,836
She/it had everything that she/it wanted.
Otherwise...

237
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,550
Was she/it pretty?

238
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,154
She/it was beautiful.

239
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,110
What?

240
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,914
As you. But eat,
you are too thin.

241
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,436
It is true,
she/it has an appetite of bird.

242
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,756
The Americans
don't eat enough.

243
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,196
To share one meal,
does that weld a family, no?

244
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,918
This mirror broke itself!

245
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,400
It is the bouquet.
7 years of misfortune besides!

246
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,158
The setting was warped.

247
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,756
These things are so old.

248
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,038
Maybe a gap of temperature
sudden...

249
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,350
Or someone else to the castle!

250
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,315
Who is there?

251
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,875
Who are you?

252
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,354
I know that you are there!

253
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,828
There is someone!

254
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,558
- What happens?
- A nightmare?

255
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,792
There was someone,
I am sure of it.

256
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,394
Calm you, I believe you.
I am going to look for.

257
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,039
Dad, pay attention.

258
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,111
Don't worry. I arrive.

259
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,550
Calm you, my love. I am there.

260
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,673
JJ?

261
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,558
My small boy...

262
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,673
Your daughter heard something
this night

263
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,037
and felt a presence in the cellar,

264
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,515
is it well that?

265
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,910
But you didn't see anybody,
if I understand well?

266
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,190
No but I heard some tears.

267
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,428
You heard to cry
Signora Reilly?

268
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,669
No.

269
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,069
What did he/it say?

270
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,995
That the doors are closed and that him
a traces of break-in there.

271
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,631
No one of the outside
didn't enter in the castle.

272
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,796
But you won't be sure of it
if you don't search.

273
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,996
There are more than 150 pieces
to the Orsini castle.

274
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,757
One cannot make any research
with so few proofs.

275
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,628
My daughter affirms to have heard
something.

276
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,559
It is surely the case.

277
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,790
There are a lot of noises
in a castle, especially the night.

278
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,077
Everybody believes that I invent.

279
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,436
No, I believe
that you didn't understand.

280
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,319
It is you that don't understand!

281
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,155
One waits for you
that you searched the castle!

282
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,797
And that say yourselves the mirror?

283
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,833
How you are you injured
to the hand?

284
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:26,358
Do you think about me?
Why would I break my mirror?

285
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,595
What you saw
disturb you maybe.

286
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,234
John, she/it slept little
the last night.

287
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,834
As us.
I have something to show you.

288
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:42,750
What therefore?

289
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,195
Come, it is necessary that you see that.

290
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,669
Here, Susan.

291
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,751
It is bizarre, she/it disappeared.

292
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,394
There was a boy's photo
who looked like JJ.

293
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,397
I assure you, the double of JJ!
She/it was there.

294
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,719
Who is "Giorgio?"

295
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,031
The duchess's son.
He/it died to 5 years.

296
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,918
John, stop. It is not funny!

297
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,469
When I saw the photo last night,

298
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,516
I thought that it was JJ.

299
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,758
- Of what do you speak?
- I felt the presence of JJ.

300
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,835
Me also, I sometimes feel it.

301
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,277
It is not about that,
he/it was really there.

302
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,233
I know, it is for that
that I wanted that the police searches

303
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,277
and find something.

304
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,596
He/it died.

305
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,599
JJ died.

306
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,076
I know.

307
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,916
Stop!
You are not anymore a child!

308
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,230
He/it died, I was of it,
but listens,

309
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,868
his/her/its soul, his/her/its ghost was there!

310
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,792
Agnese says that the castle is haunted.

311
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,192
No, it is your conscience. You deny
the reality without giving you account of it.

312
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,270
It is different, there.

313
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,790
No, not of everything!
It is never your mistake!

314
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,155
You were alcoholic
because of your father

315
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,914
and turned of the faculty because
politically incorrect.

316
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,911
- And there, you use JJ.
- No!

317
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,957
If! It is not the ghost of JJ,

318
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,633
it is you, John!

319
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:34,078
It is you that drove
while being drunk!

320
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,519
You returned blind Becky
and killed our son!

321
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,716
And do you now, punish myself?

322
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,868
Yes, God didn't make it.

323
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,515
He/it let you pull of it to you
without a scrape.

324
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,118
What do you want that I make?

325
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,755
I would have preferred that it is I!

326
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,353
Me also.

327
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,597
The international language...

328
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,473
No, sorry, I don't smoke.

329
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,673
Do I can you to offer a glass?

330
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,316
Give what she/it wants to the lady.

331
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,553
Did you hear?

332
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,589
The same thing.

333
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,199
That is that that you...

334
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,559
I am distressed, Joe.

335
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:35,113
He/it tries to tell you
that he/it closes the bar.

336
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,629
Hold therefore...

337
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,156
He/it closes it for me, yes!

338
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,472
You should go back at home.

339
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,558
That goes, I understood.

340
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,632
I leave,
I caused enough like that problems.

341
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,597
Hold, for your pain, Joe.

342
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,399
It is for her,
give him what she/it wants.

343
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,310
What?

344
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,035
Do I have to you a glass of wine, no?

345
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:21,433
I know a small friendly place

346
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,637
open all night long.

347
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,435
Excellent!

348
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,430
Silence!

349
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,151
The noise circulates quickly, here.

350
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,436
It is not about being disturbed.

351
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,991
What ruffian you make...

352
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,034
If he/it pleases you,

353
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,193
it is necessary that you leave.

354
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,479
I am distressed.

355
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,509
No, indeed...

356
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,678
it was very well but...

357
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:04,839
It is necessary that you leave.

358
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:09,669
What?

359
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,354
I am beast...

360
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:26,956
Take them.

361
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,235
Take them!

362
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,469
M. the policeman.

363
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:33,832
It is you that I come to see.
Alone together.

364
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,678
You will see me me also.

365
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,589
What do you want?

366
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,357
Help us to recover
Sylvana Lucci.

367
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:43,430
Who?

368
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,876
She/it didn't go back
at home yesterday.

369
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,438
I am not informed of anything.

370
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,956
The last time that one saw it,

371
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,957
she/it went to the castle with you.

372
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,039
She/it is not here.

373
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,837
No one saw it again
since last night.

374
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,028
She/it is not here.

375
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,239
Can I throw a .il?

376
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,750
You refused yesterday.

377
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,116
It is you that refuse,
now.

378
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:17,949
Some what it is bothersome?

379
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,190
It is just to bore me.

380
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,348
Sylvana Lucci has a small child.

381
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,835
In other words,
a mother disappeared.

382
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:27,796
Am I suspected?

383
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,155
Has a crime been committed?

384
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,311
No. Useless to search, therefore.

385
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:34,791
Then, come to the station
to answer some questions.

386
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,315
Not before having spoken
to my lawyer.

387
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,592
Did you bring a woman here?

388
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:45,909
I was alone.

389
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,513
You were drunk!

390
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:14,718
Who are you?

391
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,435
What do you want?

392
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,593
Free me!
I am a friend of the police officers.

393
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:33,317
To the help!

394
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:04,468
Free me. I have a child.

395
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:40,954
Please!

396
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:53,873
You don't listen to me!

397
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,395
I listen to you
but I don't agree.

398
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:58,630
If he/it always drinks,
he/it needs us!

399
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,279
I am tired, Becky.

400
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,675
I am so tired...

401
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:08,235
If one remains together,
one of us will finish mad.

402
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:14,075
If that happened
as you say it,

403
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,912
there is not any proof against you.

404
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:17,559
Anything didn't happen other.

405
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:20,109
Then, they will recover Mrs. Lucci

406
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:24,432
or they will find an explanation
and you will be cleared.

407
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:32,318
You know of course this lady
is the police officer's mistress.

408
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:33,317
What?

409
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,479
It is a prostitute,
she/it had to hit itself/themselves the whole city.

410
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:38,314
Me including.

411
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:42,071
But the other men
didn't make him a child.

412
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:44,799
Is the child of him?

413
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:49,198
Ille denies
but everybody knows it.

414
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,678
A charming small boy.

415
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:54,795
One cannot prove anything
against you.

416
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:36,313
It was my s.ur,
she/it found the bag of Sylvana.

417
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,559
His/her/its purse, I want to say.

418
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:39,914
She/it will have forgotten it.

419
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,269
A woman doesn't forget
his/her/its purse.

420
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:47,838
I fear that they stop you,
now.

421
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:48,796
What?

422
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:51,788
It is ridiculous! I didn't make anything!

423
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:54,708
If the police finds the bag...

424
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:00,869
What is one going to make?

425
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:05,914
I am your lawyer, I believe you.
It is not a proof.

426
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,073
And then, why would say it one
to the police officers?

427
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,470
I swear you
that I don't have him anything makes.

428
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:13,079
We agree.

429
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:15,072
Agnese will give me the bag.

430
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:18,471
I will keep it
until one recovers Mrs. Lucci.

431
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:25,033
He/it remains to speak money only,
now.

432
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,513
I don't understand...

433
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,233
Since your business complicates itself,

434
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:36,035
I must increase my fees.

435
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:38,390
It is the blackmail!

436
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:41,795
Species of illegitimate child.

437
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:47,315
He/it is time
that you know the truth.

438
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:48,879
Of what do you speak?

439
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:52,191
I speak of the first woman
of your father.

440
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,154
What scandal...

441
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:57,792
The duchess of Orsino
who marries an American soldier!

442
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:00,469
The duchess?

443
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:03,029
Yes, they got married
and had a child.

444
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:08,150
Then, your father had enough
and ran away

445
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,710
with his/her/its young s.ur in America.

446
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:14,949
My parents
never spoke to me of it.

447
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,633
Why would they have made it?

448
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,788
The duchess could not divorce,
she/it is the nobility.

449
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:26,279
The marriage between your father
and his/her/its s.ur is therefore illegitimate.

450
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:32,712
Your father was never married
to your mother!

451
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:34,672
It is you, Giovanni,

452
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,114
the illegitimate child.

453
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:07,998
Beloved, go up by car.

454
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:11,196
- I must say goodbye.
- No, go up!

455
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,676
- Do you go where?
- One leaves.

456
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:17,149
Listen to me, they are going to stop me.

457
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:18,196
Why?

458
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:20,510
They didn't always recover
this girl.

459
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:23,956
You brought a prostitute at home!
And Betty was there.

460
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:26,475
If you leave,
I will seem guilty!

461
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,471
I should have left 2 years ago.

462
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:30,835
If he/it pleases you...

463
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:32,437
I implore of it to you.

464
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:35,910
You give the whip for
that one whips you, I am not able to anything there.

465
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:39,716
The whip?

466
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,518
Why did she/it have a whip?

467
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:47,990
I know what happened!

468
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:49,679
And I can prove it!

469
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,029
Goodbye, dad!

470
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,794
To soon, my love,
I promise you it!

471
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:07,671
I am grieved, Mrs. Reilly,

472
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:11,833
but we must take
your husband to the police.

473
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:14,994
I am sure
that he/it will be able to explain itself.

474
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:16,639
One must search the castle.

475
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:20,110
Make your work,
my daughter and I return to Rome.

476
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:24,193
You should remain to Orsino
to answer some questions.

477
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:26,078
One ignores everything of this history!

478
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:30,791
We must interrogate you.
But first, your spouse.

479
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:55,717
Thank you for your cooperation.

480
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:58,155
You keep us
against our will.

481
01:08:58,320 --> 01:08:59,548
Where is Agnese?

482
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:01,668
I don't know anything of it.

483
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:05,673
One wanted to greet it
but one didn't find it.

484
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,913
Where is the staircase?

485
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,556
Someone must remain with my daughter.

486
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,550
It is a policeman,
he/it is going to remain with you.

487
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:27,878
What, mom, happens?

488
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:46,995
What do you play?

489
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:50,755
Rebecca is right,
there is someone in this castle.

490
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:54,036
God forgives to you.

491
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:00,994
And has.

492
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:03,118
Nothing that of the stones!

493
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:04,915
He/it is not there!

494
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:06,593
- Who?
- Giorgio Of Orsino!

495
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:08,957
He/it has never been buried!

496
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:10,639
He/it is living!

497
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:14,632
Don't you therefore understand?
He/it is in this castle!

498
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:16,590
Where is my s.ur?

499
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:19,069
I ignore it.
He/it removed it maybe!

500
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:20,639
Follow us, M. Reilly.

501
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,872
What? A small minute.
Listen to me!

502
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:27,715
Go to the floor,
in the duchess's room.

503
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:31,873
She/it has a whip! For what to make?
On whom did she/it use it?

504
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:35,793
Think!
She/it didn't let enter no one.

505
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:39,111
And who was there since the departure?
His/her/its son!

506
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:42,274
He/it didn't die!
She/it hid it!

507
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,916
She/it made her/its scapegoat of it

508
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:47,310
to take vengeance of his/her/its husband
who left!

509
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,435
Very intelligent.

510
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:52,474
It is he that broke the mirror,
who approached Rebecca!

511
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:55,672
Believe me, it is necessary
that you searched the castle!

512
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,355
My God!

513
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,713
I stop you, M. Reilly.

514
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:25,030
What?

515
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:27,755
It is not I.
Why would I have fact that?

516
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:31,836
Everything that you say
will be able to be kept against you.

517
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,594
It is not I, I swear it!
Help me!

518
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,752
Please, help me.
I am innocent!

519
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:02,356
Grimaldi and Benedetti
will spend the night here.

520
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:06,514
You will go by the police
tomorrow with your daughter.

521
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:10,519
Sensible. Thank you.

522
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:13,029
Is that going to go?

523
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:32,478
Can one have water?

524
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:32,349
Find me someone
who speaks English!

525
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:52,238
M. the policeman,
are you willing to listen to me?

526
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:54,958
Do you answer my questions?

527
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:59,238
Sensible but take my family
far from this castle!

528
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:02,115
Why?

529
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:06,150
There is a maniac over there,
they are in danger!

530
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:09,591
And that is this "maniac",
Giorgio Of Orsino?

531
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:13,594
You saw this empty coffin.
Why bury it if he/it is empty?

532
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,637
It was 40 years ago.

533
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:19,317
It is yesterday that interests me.
Why murder Sylvana?

534
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:22,074
I kill me to tell it to you
since in a little while,

535
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:24,310
I didn't kill it!
It is he!

536
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:38,268
That is sufficient with your histories.

537
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:41,073
Say me the truth.

538
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:57,953
One asked for water. Acqua.
Does she/it arrive?

539
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,513
I go there.

540
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,314
She/it arrives, my love.

541
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,278
One is going to take itself/themselves of it, my love.

542
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,676
One will go back soon home.

543
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:47,748
You believe
what that is dad the murderer?

544
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:52,554
Yes, you believe it.

545
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:55,359
You believe that he/it killed JJ.

546
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,675
You must like JJ more than me.

547
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:02,599
Why do you say that?

548
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:05,355
You hate yourselves
since he/it died.

549
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:07,229
My love...

550
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,511
One likes you all two,

551
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:13,478
do you know it, no?

552
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:14,391
Yes.

553
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:18,713
And whatever it occurs,
your father needs our prayers.

554
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:20,989
Pray then with me.

555
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:29,118
Celestial father,

556
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:31,789
if he/it pleases you, watch over us,

557
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:35,191
protect us
in this period of unrest.

558
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:38,598
And help my mother
to forgive to my father.

559
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:40,835
God,

560
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:44,712
make that our family
is united again.

561
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:57,716
Will one inform tomorrow morning, okay?

562
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:00,711
Here is that my migraines come back.

563
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:02,831
I have your medicines.

564
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:08,439
I thought
that anything would be more ever normal.

565
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:12,274
Where is this water?

566
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:13,710
Do you listen to me?

567
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:16,398
Yes, my love, I listen to you.

568
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,678
I put some to me
that it is more normal,

569
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:21,309
I don't like the normal.

570
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:24,635
No, indeed!

571
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:26,999
Now, I put some to me

572
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:30,232
of all these silly things,
the car,

573
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:32,268
the dance of year end...

574
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:51,471
When I will have a boyfriend,

575
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,229
it will necessarily be someone of good

576
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:57,514
since he/it will put himself/itself of it
that I am blind.

577
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:01,389
I will judge to what he/it is indeed,
not to his/her/its appearance.

578
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,479
It will be the love,

579
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,033
the big love.

580
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:17,519
It is you!

581
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:10,959
If he/it pleases you,

582
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:13,628
I answered
to all your questions

583
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:15,958
and now,

584
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:19,635
take my daughter and my wife
far from this castle!

585
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:22,357
One doesn't give orders, here.

586
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:26,439
And you will answer our questions
as one waits for it of you.

587
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:31,236
Now, say me
why you killed Sylvana.

588
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,311
I didn't kill it,
I kissed it!

589
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:22,115
Why do you make me that?

590
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:27,074
What do you want?

591
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:38,870
Please, leave me!

592
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:41,999
The police is there,
she/it is going to stop you!

593
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:07,910
Stop!

594
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:10,356
Free it!

595
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:15,270
Free it!

596
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:17,635
Take me!

597
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,836
Go, take me!

598
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:28,716
Save you, mom!

599
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,916
Mom, he/it is there, he/it arrives!

600
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:20,797
Giorgio!

601
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:46,874
Forgive me.

602
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:50,194
I am distressed.

603
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:53,118
I like you.

604
01:30:58,200 --> 01:30:58,996
I like you.
