1
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,447
It's hormonal.

2
00:00:39,448 --> 00:00:44,786
I mean, I don't usually fall
back on.. It's women's issues.

3
00:00:44,787 --> 00:00:48,252
But child-proofed how?
Gates and stuff?

4
00:00:48,253 --> 00:00:49,647
Dude, she did the drawers.

5
00:00:49,648 --> 00:00:51,966
We don't even know if this
whole fertility thing's gonna work..

6
00:00:51,967 --> 00:00:54,834
she's screwed in these little jobbies
where you can't even open the drawers.

7
00:00:54,835 --> 00:00:55,732
At all?

8
00:00:55,733 --> 00:00:58,865
No. They open an inch,
then you gotta dig your finger in.

9
00:00:58,866 --> 00:01:01,192
- It's a nightmare.
-I guess sooner or later..

10
00:01:01,193 --> 00:01:03,673
Yeah, a lot later.
She did the upper cabinets.

11
00:01:03,674 --> 00:01:07,659
Kid will be 30 before he can
reach them, assuming we have a kid.

12
00:01:09,808 --> 00:01:12,067
It is natural for
her to feel protective.

13
00:01:12,068 --> 00:01:14,484
Don't even.. You have women's issues.

14
00:01:14,485 --> 00:01:17,367
Please. You of all people.

15
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,966
Oh, come on. It's a jinx.

16
00:01:18,967 --> 00:01:22,335
It guarantees that
we won't get pregnant.

17
00:01:22,336 --> 00:01:25,376
And it takes me about 20
minutes to get a fucking beer.

18
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:26,733
Guys. Guys!

19
00:01:26,734 --> 00:01:27,997
Stockholm went south.

20
00:01:27,998 --> 00:01:31,117
Seriously?
I thought they were looking good.

21
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:32,220
What cracked?

22
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:35,337
I haven't seen the footage.
Word's just going around

23
00:01:35,338 --> 00:01:37,444
Well, that's never
been a stable scenario.

24
00:01:37,445 --> 00:01:39,529
Everyone knows you can't trust Swedes.

25
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,265
That means there's just Japan.
Japan and us.

26
00:01:42,266 --> 00:01:44,032
It's not the first time
it's come down to that.

27
00:01:44,033 --> 00:01:45,877
Japan has a perfect record.

28
00:01:45,878 --> 00:01:47,364
We're number two. We try harder.

29
00:01:47,365 --> 00:01:48,946
If we fail, then..

30
00:01:48,947 --> 00:01:50,700
Please. We haven't
had a glitch since '98.

31
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:52,136
We know what we're doing, Lin.

32
00:01:52,137 --> 00:01:54,627
Or we have it written down..
somewhere.

33
00:01:54,628 --> 00:01:56,427
You guys better not
be messing around in there.

34
00:01:56,428 --> 00:01:59,731
Does this mean you're not in
the betting pool this year? Big money.

35
00:01:59,732 --> 00:02:02,835
I'm just saying, it's a key scenario.

36
00:02:02,836 --> 00:02:04,416
No, I hear what you're saying.

37
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:07,630
In '98, it was the chem
department's fault, right?

38
00:02:07,631 --> 00:02:11,049
Where do you work, again?
Wait. It's coming back to me, now.

39
00:02:12,395 --> 00:02:15,637
It's gonna be a long weekend
if everyone's that puckered up.

40
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:18,472
You wanna come over Monday night?

41
00:02:18,473 --> 00:02:22,184
I'm gonna pick up some power drills.
Liberate my cabinets.

42
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:25,016
Are you even listening to me?

43
00:03:11,265 --> 00:03:12,582
Professor fuckwad.

44
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,489
Why haven't you stuck that asshole's
picture on the dartboard yet?

45
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,567
It's not that simple
Oh, my God!

46
00:03:18,568 --> 00:03:21,234
Your hair. It's blonde.
- Very fabulous, no?

47
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:24,070
I can't believe you did it.
-But very fabulous, right?

48
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:27,830
Hurry up with the "very fabulous."
I'm getting insecure about it now.

49
00:03:27,831 --> 00:03:30,575
No, it looks awesome.
Curt's gonna lose it.

50
00:03:30,576 --> 00:03:33,535
Curt's gonna thank me.
And so will you..

51
00:03:33,536 --> 00:03:35,496
while we're burning this picture.

52
00:03:35,497 --> 00:03:36,682
Not ready.

53
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:39,504
Seriously, this isn't his fault.

54
00:03:39,505 --> 00:03:41,854
What's not his fault?

55
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:45,289
Fucking his student or
breaking up with her by email?

56
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,256
I knew what I was getting into.

57
00:03:47,257 --> 00:03:47,968
Oh, please.

58
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:49,783
You know what you're
getting into this weekend?

59
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,967
This.

60
00:03:52,968 --> 00:03:55,744
And if Holden's as
cute as Curt says he is..

61
00:03:55,745 --> 00:03:57,432
possibly getting out of it.

62
00:03:57,433 --> 00:03:59,652
That is the last thing that I want.

63
00:03:59,653 --> 00:04:02,291
If you treat this like a setup,
I'm gonna have no fun at all.

64
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:03,437
I'm not pushing..

65
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:05,779
but we're packing this!

66
00:04:07,186 --> 00:04:09,774
Which means we definitely
won't have room for..

67
00:04:09,775 --> 00:04:11,387
What if I get bored?

68
00:04:11,388 --> 00:04:12,772
These will help?

69
00:04:12,773 --> 00:04:17,135
Soviet Economic Structures?
Aftermath of the..

70
00:04:17,136 --> 00:04:21,218
No! We have a lake and a keg.

71
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,998
No more learning!
-Think fast.

72
00:04:22,999 --> 00:04:24,613
Faster than that.

73
00:04:24,614 --> 00:04:28,941
Sorry. Sorry. Move along.

74
00:04:28,942 --> 00:04:31,756
Nice!
-Is that Holden?

75
00:04:31,757 --> 00:04:34,562
We'll be right down.
He just transferred from State.

76
00:04:34,563 --> 00:04:37,268
Best hands on the team.
He's a sweet guy.

77
00:04:37,269 --> 00:04:38,780
And he's good with his hands.

78
00:04:38,781 --> 00:04:41,327
I'm kinda seeing this girl..

79
00:04:41,328 --> 00:04:43,749
but you're way blonder than she is.

80
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,561
But I was thinking, you know, maybe..
What is this?

81
00:04:47,562 --> 00:04:49,841
What.. this?
What are you doing with these?

82
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,290
Okay, I get it. I'll leave the books.

83
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,548
No, who gave you these?
Who taught you about these?

84
00:04:53,549 --> 00:04:55,419
I learned it from you, okay?

85
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,748
I learned it from watching you!

86
00:04:57,749 --> 00:05:03,145
Seriously, Professor Bennett, he
covers this whole book in his lectures.

87
00:05:04,077 --> 00:05:07,209
You should read this.

88
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,711
Gurovsky. Now this is way
more interesting.

89
00:05:09,712 --> 00:05:11,438
Also, Bennett doesn't
know it by heart..

90
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:13,107
so he'll think you're insightful.

91
00:05:13,108 --> 00:05:16,026
And you have no pants.

92
00:05:16,027 --> 00:05:18,270
Oh, shit!

93
00:05:23,307 --> 00:05:25,253
- That pretty much it?
-Fucking better be.

94
00:05:25,254 --> 00:05:28,117
You know, Jules,
it's a weekend, not an evacuation.

95
00:05:28,118 --> 00:05:31,382
Trust me when I say there
is nothing in those cases..

96
00:05:31,383 --> 00:05:32,724
you won't be glad I brought.

97
00:05:32,725 --> 00:05:34,658
I'm shutting' right up.

98
00:05:36,588 --> 00:05:40,456
Oh, my God.

99
00:05:44,312 --> 00:05:45,411
Marty!

100
00:05:48,241 --> 00:05:50,009
Fuck is wrong with you, bro?

101
00:05:52,871 --> 00:05:57,673
People in this town drive
in a very counterintuitive manner.

102
00:05:58,596 --> 00:06:00,464
That's what I have to say.

103
00:06:00,465 --> 00:06:02,868
Do you wanna spend
the weekend in jail?

104
00:06:02,869 --> 00:06:05,213
We'd all like to check
out my cousin's country home.

105
00:06:05,214 --> 00:06:06,838
Honey, that's not okay.

106
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,442
Statistical fact..

107
00:06:08,443 --> 00:06:12,563
Cops will never pull over
a man with a huge bong in his car.

108
00:06:12,564 --> 00:06:13,175
Why?

109
00:06:13,176 --> 00:06:17,139
They fear this man.
They know he sees further than they..

110
00:06:18,687 --> 00:06:21,792
and he will bind them
with ancient logics.

111
00:06:23,343 --> 00:06:24,970
Have you gone gray?

112
00:06:24,971 --> 00:06:27,318
You're not bringing
that thing in the Rambler.

113
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,622
What?

114
00:06:28,623 --> 00:06:31,653
A giant bong in your father's van?

115
00:06:33,503 --> 00:06:34,774
What are you, stoned?

116
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,641
Hey, man.

117
00:06:39,682 --> 00:06:42,673
Dana, you fetching minx!

118
00:06:42,674 --> 00:06:44,304
You have any food?

119
00:06:46,177 --> 00:06:47,451
Everybody ready?
- Yeah!

120
00:06:47,452 --> 00:06:50,724
Yeah?
- Okay, I'm ready!

121
00:06:50,725 --> 00:06:53,121
Let's get this show on the road!

122
00:07:11,903 --> 00:07:13,814
Nest is empty. We're right on time.

123
00:07:17,298 --> 00:07:18,492
I hope this is the right road.

124
00:07:18,493 --> 00:07:20,924
It doesn't even show up on the GPS.

125
00:07:20,925 --> 00:07:22,961
It is unworthy of global positioning.

126
00:07:22,962 --> 00:07:26,871
That's the whole point.
Get off the grid, right?

127
00:07:26,872 --> 00:07:29,215
No cell phone reception..

128
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:31,505
no traffic cameras.

129
00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:35,239
Go someplace for one goddamn
weekend where they can't..

130
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,835
globally position my ass, man.

131
00:07:37,836 --> 00:07:40,321
This is the whole issue.

132
00:07:40,322 --> 00:07:42,080
Is society crumbling, Marty?

133
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:44,744
No. Society is binding. Right?

134
00:07:44,745 --> 00:07:48,034
It's filling in the
cracks with concrete.

135
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:52,633
Everything's filed or
recorded or blogged, right?

136
00:07:52,634 --> 00:07:56,048
Chips in our kids' heads
so they won't get lost.

137
00:07:56,049 --> 00:07:58,209
Society needs to crumble.

138
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:01,131
We're all just too
chicken-shit to let it.

139
00:08:01,132 --> 00:08:02,822
I've missed your rants.

140
00:08:02,823 --> 00:08:05,999
You will come to see things my way.

141
00:08:11,685 --> 00:08:12,928
Identification, please.

142
00:08:15,926 --> 00:08:17,281
Mr. Sitterson.

143
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:19,374
Mr. Hadley.
- Thank you.

144
00:08:19,452 --> 00:08:21,529
What's your name?
- Daniel Truman, sir.

145
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,844
This isn't the military.
You can drop the "sir".

146
00:08:23,845 --> 00:08:27,601
But Sitterson does
like to be called "ma'am."

147
00:08:27,602 --> 00:08:30,248
Or "honey toes."
- He'll also answer to "honey toes."

148
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:31,518
You clear on what's
gonna be happening here?

149
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,012
I've been prepped. Extensively.

150
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:36,152
Did they tell you that being prepped
is not the same as being prepared?

151
00:08:36,153 --> 00:08:38,751
They told me.
I'll hold my post, Mr. Hadley.

152
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:39,502
Good man.

153
00:08:40,865 --> 00:08:42,931
Okay. System's online.

154
00:08:42,932 --> 00:08:46,712
Acquiring target.
Let's see what we got.

155
00:09:22,924 --> 00:09:25,037
I'm thinking this thing
doesn't take credit cards.

156
00:09:26,219 --> 00:09:28,873
I don't think it knows about money.

157
00:09:29,847 --> 00:09:31,277
I think it's barter gas.

158
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,802
Hello?

159
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:03,951
Hey, Holden.

160
00:10:06,903 --> 00:10:08,993
Holden!
- I don't think there's gonna be..

161
00:10:09,074 --> 00:10:11,390
You come here uninvited?
- Fuck!

162
00:10:17,257 --> 00:10:18,978
Sign says "closed."

163
00:10:18,979 --> 00:10:21,688
Yeah, we were looking to buy some gas.

164
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:24,062
Does this pump work?

165
00:10:24,063 --> 00:10:25,666
If you know how to work it.

166
00:10:26,944 --> 00:10:29,090
We also wanted to get directions.

167
00:10:29,091 --> 00:10:31,323
We're looking for.. What's it called?

168
00:10:31,324 --> 00:10:33,898
Tillerman Road.
Do you know if it's this way?

169
00:10:35,858 --> 00:10:40,384
Tillerman Road takes
you up the hill, there.

170
00:10:40,385 --> 00:10:42,426
Dead-ends at the old Buckner place.

171
00:10:42,427 --> 00:10:44,459
My cousin bought a house up there.

172
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,586
You go through a mountain tunnel,
there's a lake.

173
00:10:46,587 --> 00:10:48,891
- Would that be the..
- Buckner place.

174
00:10:48,892 --> 00:10:52,054
Always someone looking
to sell that plot.

175
00:10:52,055 --> 00:10:53,944
You knew the original owners.

176
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:56,434
Yeah, not the first.

177
00:10:57,196 --> 00:11:01,258
I seen plenty come and go.
Hell, I been here since the war.

178
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:03,803
- Which war?
- You know damn well which war!

179
00:11:03,804 --> 00:11:09,509
Would that have been with
the blue and some in gray?

180
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:13,912
Brother, perhaps,
fighting against brother in that war?

181
00:11:13,913 --> 00:11:15,005
You sassing me, boy?

182
00:11:15,006 --> 00:11:16,632
You were rude to my friend.

183
00:11:16,633 --> 00:11:19,324
That whore?

184
00:11:19,325 --> 00:11:22,839
What'd you say?
-I think we got enough gas.

185
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,089
You got enough to get you there.

186
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,099
Getting back..

187
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,120
that's your concern.

188
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,034
Well, good luck with
your business, sir.

189
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:47,129
I know the railroad's coming
through here any day, now.

190
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,130
That's gonna be big.

191
00:11:48,131 --> 00:11:51,543
Streets paved with actual street.

192
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,653
Fucker.

193
00:13:10,421 --> 00:13:11,639
This must be it.

194
00:13:25,351 --> 00:13:28,135
Oh, my God. It's.. beautiful.

195
00:13:29,361 --> 00:13:32,634
One spider and I'm
sleeping in the Rambler.

196
00:13:32,635 --> 00:13:34,173
I mean it.

197
00:13:34,174 --> 00:13:36,819
Come on. Give me a hand.

198
00:14:33,445 --> 00:14:35,458
This is awesome.

199
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:36,979
It is kind of cool.

200
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,271
You gonna kill us a raccoon to eat?

201
00:14:39,272 --> 00:14:40,908
I will use its skin to make a cap.

202
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,721
Everybody get your suits on. In
10 minutes, we're heading to the lake.

203
00:14:45,764 --> 00:14:46,200
Yeah.

204
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,260
I was not informed there
would be calisthenics.

205
00:15:07,633 --> 00:15:09,122
Yeah, I don't think so.

206
00:15:18,552 --> 00:15:20,001
Whoa.

207
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,840
No way.

208
00:15:44,703 --> 00:15:45,752
Ah, shit.

209
00:15:50,385 --> 00:15:51,599
This is happening.

210
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:02,651
Hold up!

211
00:16:05,655 --> 00:16:07,775
You've gotta be fucking kidding me.

212
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,374
That's just creepy.

213
00:16:09,651 --> 00:16:11,459
It was pioneer days.

214
00:16:12,183 --> 00:16:14,327
People had to make their
own interrogation rooms.

215
00:16:15,185 --> 00:16:16,366
Who did your cousin
buy this place from?

216
00:16:16,838 --> 00:16:18,775
We should check the rest of the rooms,
make sure this is the only one.

217
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,232
'Cause you know Marty wants
to watch us pounding away.

218
00:16:21,905 --> 00:16:23,934
I didn't even like hearing that.

219
00:16:29,368 --> 00:16:31,149
How about we switch?

220
00:16:33,142 --> 00:16:33,799
Not that I'd..

221
00:16:34,062 --> 00:16:37,446
I mean, I'd put the picture back but you
might feel better if we switched rooms?

222
00:16:38,596 --> 00:16:39,420
I really would.

223
00:16:42,555 --> 00:16:45,383
Thanks. For being decent.

224
00:16:45,693 --> 00:16:46,453
It's the least I could do..

225
00:16:46,758 --> 00:16:49,098
since Curt and Jules
sold you to me for marriage.

226
00:16:50,449 --> 00:16:51,484
They're not subtle.

227
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:54,402
Well, I'll just be flattered
and keep it to myself.

228
00:16:54,561 --> 00:16:56,866
Yeah, I'm not looking for..

229
00:16:57,006 --> 00:16:59,250
But, I'm still grateful
that you're not a creep.

230
00:16:59,388 --> 00:17:01,904
Hey, let's not jump
to any conclusions there.

231
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:04,535
I had kind of an internal
debate about showing you the mirror.

232
00:17:04,684 --> 00:17:07,368
Shouting on both sides.
Blood was spilled.

233
00:17:07,534 --> 00:17:09,372
So, you're bleeding internally?

234
00:17:09,484 --> 00:17:10,925
Pretty bad.

235
00:17:11,015 --> 00:17:15,187
Well, Jules is pre-med.
You should probably talk to her.

236
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:19,039
Okay.

237
00:17:46,457 --> 00:17:47,553
Wow.

238
00:18:03,139 --> 00:18:10,205
Yeah, I don't think so.

239
00:18:39,413 --> 00:18:40,573
Places everyone.

240
00:18:42,033 --> 00:18:43,097
We are live.

241
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,432
Engineering, we got a room change.

242
00:18:44,511 --> 00:18:47,019
Polk is now in two, McCrea is in four.

243
00:18:47,171 --> 00:18:50,554
Operations, do you copy?
We need a scenario adjustment.

244
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:51,945
Miss Lin.

245
00:18:53,621 --> 00:18:57,953
We've got the blood work
back on Louden. Her levels are good.

246
00:18:58,218 --> 00:19:00,382
But we're recommending
a fifty-milligram bump..

247
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,310
of Rhohyptase to increase libido.

248
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,962
- Sold. - Do we pipe it in,
or do you wanna do it orally?

249
00:19:05,115 --> 00:19:07,598
Ask me that again, only slower.

250
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,570
You're a pig.

251
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:11,434
Guess how we're
slowing down cognition.

252
00:19:11,604 --> 00:19:12,352
I don't know.

253
00:19:12,398 --> 00:19:15,716
The hair dye.

254
00:19:15,917 --> 00:19:17,572
Dumb blonde. Very artistic.

255
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:21,825
Works its way into the blood,
through the scalp. Very gradual.

256
00:19:22,076 --> 00:19:25,195
Chem department keeps their end up.

257
00:19:25,383 --> 00:19:27,004
I'll see it when I believe it.

258
00:19:27,102 --> 00:19:28,621
Control?
- Yeah, go ahead.

259
00:19:28,714 --> 00:19:30,887
I have the harbinger on line two.

260
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:34,217
Oh, Christ. Can you take a message?

261
00:19:34,412 --> 00:19:37,918
I don't think so. He's really pushy.

262
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,912
To be honest,
he's kind of freaking me out.

263
00:19:42,053 --> 00:19:43,708
Okay. Put him on.

264
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:47,307
Mordecai, baby, what's happening?
How's the weather up top?

265
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,664
The lambs have passed through the gate.
They are come to the killing floor.

266
00:19:51,915 --> 00:19:54,063
Well, you're doing
a great job out there.

267
00:19:54,195 --> 00:19:57,279
By the numbers, man.
You got us started off just right.

268
00:19:57,465 --> 00:19:59,090
So, we'll talk to you later, okay?

269
00:19:59,186 --> 00:20:02,430
Their blind eyes see nothing
of the horrors to come.

270
00:20:02,627 --> 00:20:04,572
Their ears are stopped.

271
00:20:04,693 --> 00:20:06,743
They are the gods' fools.

272
00:20:06,868 --> 00:20:09,916
Well, that's.. how it works.

273
00:20:10,101 --> 00:20:13,826
Cleanse them. Cleanse the
world of their ignorance and sin.

274
00:20:14,053 --> 00:20:16,495
Bathe them in the crimson of..

275
00:20:16,644 --> 00:20:18,718
Am I on speakerphone?

276
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:22,063
No. Absolutely not.

277
00:20:22,258 --> 00:20:24,129
Speakerphone, no.
No, I wouldn't do that.

278
00:20:24,242 --> 00:20:26,245
Yes, I am. I can hear the echo.

279
00:20:26,366 --> 00:20:29,727
Oh, my God. You're right.
Hang on one second, I'll take you off.

280
00:20:29,932 --> 00:20:32,610
That's rude.
I don't know who's in the room.

281
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:35,587
Fine. There. You're off.

282
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:36,844
Thank you.

283
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:39,003
Don't take this lightly, boy.

284
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:41,765
It wasn't all by your numbers.

285
00:20:41,925 --> 00:20:46,364
The fool nearly derailed
the invocation with his insolence.

286
00:20:46,632 --> 00:20:49,241
The ancient ones see everything.

287
00:20:49,396 --> 00:20:50,824
And they will not be..

288
00:20:50,911 --> 00:20:53,455
I'm still on speakerphone, aren't I?

289
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:57,586
Oh, my God. Mordecai.

290
00:20:57,825 --> 00:21:00,433
I can't believe it. I did it again!

291
00:21:00,589 --> 00:21:01,764
Mordy?

292
00:21:01,836 --> 00:21:04,439
What happens next?

293
00:21:12,802 --> 00:21:13,790
Oh! That's cold!

294
00:21:15,342 --> 00:21:18,143
How cold? Is it worth it?

295
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,802
Come on, Jules. Life is risk.

296
00:21:20,954 --> 00:21:24,010
Yeah, I might just risk
lying out in the sun for a while.

297
00:21:24,195 --> 00:21:25,407
Boo.

298
00:21:25,481 --> 00:21:27,442
Hey, what is that?
- What?

299
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,915
In the lake, right there.

300
00:21:28,998 --> 00:21:30,914
Oh, come on. - No you guys,
I'm serious. Right there.

301
00:21:31,032 --> 00:21:33,692
There! There!
God, looks just like my girlfriend!

302
00:21:36,523 --> 00:21:37,685
Oh, my God!

303
00:21:37,757 --> 00:21:39,370
There's something else in the lake!

304
00:21:39,471 --> 00:21:43,930
It's a gorgeous man!
- I'm gonna kill you!

305
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,514
Don't kill the gorgeous man!
We're endangered!

306
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,960
All right. Last chance.

307
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:59,665
It's post time. Dig deep, people.
Betting windows are closing. Okay.

308
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:00,778
Okay, who's still out?

309
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:05,037
Let's see. We got engineering,
we got R & D, and we got electrical.

310
00:22:05,293 --> 00:22:06,756
Did you see who they picked?

311
00:22:06,844 --> 00:22:08,136
They're practically
giving their money away.

312
00:22:08,213 --> 00:22:10,135
You should talk, Aquaman.

313
00:22:10,253 --> 00:22:12,383
What do you mean?
- Ah, nothing.

314
00:22:13,802 --> 00:22:14,750
Okay, all right.

315
00:22:14,806 --> 00:22:17,050
I'm not even sure
we have one of these.

316
00:22:17,189 --> 00:22:18,390
Zoology swears we do.

317
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:21,368
They'd know. Okay. All right, people.

318
00:22:21,544 --> 00:22:22,631
Hey, what do you got?

319
00:22:22,698 --> 00:22:24,840
No, they've already been picked.

320
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,714
What? No. Who took them?

321
00:22:26,822 --> 00:22:27,777
Maintenance.

322
00:22:27,835 --> 00:22:29,711
Maintenance?
They pick the same thing every year.

323
00:22:29,827 --> 00:22:30,831
What do you want from me?

324
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:32,408
If they were creative,
they wouldn't be in maintenance.

325
00:22:32,499 --> 00:22:34,503
You're gonna have to split
this if you win. You wanna switch?

326
00:22:34,624 --> 00:22:39,053
I don't know, I don't know.
What do you think?

327
00:22:39,323 --> 00:22:42,143
More than anything,
I just want this moment to end.

328
00:22:46,187 --> 00:22:47,824
Not betting?

329
00:22:47,925 --> 00:22:49,153
Not for me. Thanks.

330
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,448
Seems a little harsh, doesn't it?

331
00:22:52,562 --> 00:22:54,945
It's just people letting off steam.

332
00:22:57,037 --> 00:23:00,043
This job isn't easy,
however those clowns may behave.

333
00:23:00,226 --> 00:23:04,427
Does the director.
Do they know about this downstairs?

334
00:23:04,682 --> 00:23:05,977
The director doesn't
care about this stuff.

335
00:23:06,056 --> 00:23:07,732
As long as everything
goes smoothly upstairs..

336
00:23:07,837 --> 00:23:09,669
as long as the kids
do as they're told.

337
00:23:09,781 --> 00:23:11,084
But then it's fixed.

338
00:23:11,165 --> 00:23:12,777
No, no, no.

339
00:23:12,874 --> 00:23:15,941
How can you wager on this
when you control the outcome?

340
00:23:16,127 --> 00:23:18,741
No, we just get 'em in the cellar.
They take it from there.

341
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:20,974
No, they have to make the
choice of their own free will.

342
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,891
Otherwise the system doesn't work.

343
00:23:22,999 --> 00:23:24,849
It's like the harbinger.

344
00:23:24,961 --> 00:23:29,395
It's this creepy old fuck, practically
wears a sign, "You will die."

345
00:23:29,663 --> 00:23:31,559
Why do we put him there? The system.

346
00:23:31,673 --> 00:23:34,049
They have to choose to ignore him..

347
00:23:34,194 --> 00:23:36,408
and they have to choose
what happens in the cellar.

348
00:23:36,544 --> 00:23:38,433
Yeah, we rig the game
as much as we need to..

349
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:40,596
but in the end,
they don't transgress..

350
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,946
hey can't be punished.

351
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,504
So what's it gonna be, Truman?
You in? Window's closing.

352
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,575
I'm fine.

353
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:52,772
Okay.

354
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,290
That's it, gang!

355
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:55,881
The board is locked!

356
00:23:55,973 --> 00:23:58,224
Oh, let's get this party started!

357
00:23:58,361 --> 00:24:00,715
Let's get this party started!

358
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,154
There you go.

359
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,110
Okay, my turn.

360
00:24:15,226 --> 00:24:16,313
Jules.

361
00:24:19,102 --> 00:24:21,038
Truth or dare?

362
00:24:21,156 --> 00:24:22,278
Let's go dare.

363
00:24:22,621 --> 00:24:23,609
All right.

364
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:27,353
I dare you to make out with..

365
00:24:27,577 --> 00:24:29,371
Please say "Dana," please say "Dana."

366
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:31,147
That moose, over there.

367
00:24:32,817 --> 00:24:34,258
Marty..

368
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:36,941
have you ever seen a moose before?

369
00:24:38,801 --> 00:24:41,233
Whatever that mysterious beast is.

370
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,860
That's a wolf.

371
00:24:44,347 --> 00:24:46,915
I'm living in a womb of reefer,
leave me alone.

372
00:24:48,284 --> 00:24:49,104
Jules..

373
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,874
I dare you to make out with that wolf.

374
00:24:53,193 --> 00:24:54,233
No problem.

375
00:25:19,403 --> 00:25:20,497
Who?

376
00:25:20,563 --> 00:25:22,423
Me?

377
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:25,102
Well, yes, I am new in town.

378
00:25:25,228 --> 00:25:27,130
How did you know?

379
00:25:27,248 --> 00:25:31,258
Oh, my God.
That is so sweet of you to say.

380
00:25:31,501 --> 00:25:33,351
I just colored it, in fact.

381
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:34,787
No, no, no.

382
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:37,128
There's no need to huff and puff.

383
00:25:37,264 --> 00:25:40,278
I'll let you come in.

384
00:26:14,562 --> 00:26:16,936
Thank you.

385
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:21,689
Yeah.

386
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:30,122
Now,...

387
00:26:30,235 --> 00:26:31,226
Dana.

388
00:26:31,287 --> 00:26:32,211
Truth.

389
00:26:32,269 --> 00:26:34,953
What's that supposed to mean?

390
00:26:35,118 --> 00:26:36,569
I'm just skipping ahead.

391
00:26:36,658 --> 00:26:38,655
You're gonna say dare.

392
00:26:38,776 --> 00:26:40,431
She's gonna dare you to
do something you don't like..

393
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:44,548
and then you'll puss out and
say that you wanted truth all along.

394
00:26:44,792 --> 00:26:46,270
Really?

395
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,412
Okay, Jules.

396
00:26:49,517 --> 00:26:51,277
Dare.

397
00:26:52,782 --> 00:26:53,604
What the hell was that?

398
00:26:54,885 --> 00:26:55,658
It's the cellar door.

399
00:26:56,746 --> 00:26:58,709
The wind must've blown it open.

400
00:26:59,693 --> 00:27:01,650
That makes what kinda sense?

401
00:27:01,769 --> 00:27:03,407
What do you think is down there?

402
00:27:07,746 --> 00:27:09,280
Why don't we find out?

403
00:27:11,878 --> 00:27:12,945
Dana.

404
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:15,691
I dare you.

405
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,354
How long do I have to stay down here?

406
00:27:34,518 --> 00:27:36,595
Oh, you know, just 'til morning.

407
00:28:12,112 --> 00:28:12,986
Dana.

408
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:16,164
You okay?

409
00:28:16,306 --> 00:28:17,661
Yeah.

410
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:22,143
Sorry, I just scared myself.

411
00:28:22,253 --> 00:28:24,520
Well, you called for help.
That voids the dare.

412
00:28:24,658 --> 00:28:26,294
Take your top off.

413
00:28:26,395 --> 00:28:27,782
What?

414
00:28:27,866 --> 00:28:29,589
I don't make up the rules.

415
00:28:31,408 --> 00:28:33,062
Oh, my God.

416
00:28:35,994 --> 00:28:38,130
Look at all this.

417
00:28:40,763 --> 00:28:43,273
Guys..

418
00:28:43,428 --> 00:28:47,941
I'm not sure it's
awesome to be down here.

419
00:28:48,213 --> 00:28:50,092
Guys?

420
00:28:50,206 --> 00:28:54,900
Dude, seriously,
your cousin is into some weird shit.

421
00:28:55,183 --> 00:28:57,771
I'm pretty sure this ain't his.

422
00:28:57,927 --> 00:29:01,631
Maybe it was the people
who put in that mirror thing.

423
00:29:06,835 --> 00:29:08,017
Some of this stuff looks really old.

424
00:29:08,087 --> 00:29:09,927
It's beautiful.

425
00:29:14,643 --> 00:29:16,534
Maybe we should go back upstairs.

426
00:29:20,267 --> 00:29:23,169
I dare you all to go upstairs.

427
00:30:17,684 --> 00:30:18,489
Guys?

428
00:30:20,301 --> 00:30:21,658
Guys, listen to this.

429
00:30:21,743 --> 00:30:24,149
"April fourth.

430
00:30:24,295 --> 00:30:28,311
"Father was cross with me
and said I lacked the true faith.

431
00:30:28,555 --> 00:30:31,347
"I wish I could prove my devotion..

432
00:30:31,518 --> 00:30:33,925
"as Judah and Matthew
proved on those travelers."

433
00:30:34,073 --> 00:30:34,995
What is that?

434
00:30:35,053 --> 00:30:41,072
Diary of Anna Patience Buckner, 1903.

435
00:30:41,437 --> 00:30:44,805
"Mama screamed most of the night.

436
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,487
"I prayed that she might find faith..

437
00:30:47,636 --> 00:30:50,389
"but she only stopped
when Papa cut her belly..

438
00:30:50,556 --> 00:30:51,967
"and stuffed the coals in.

439
00:30:52,053 --> 00:30:54,323
"Judah told me in my dream..

440
00:30:54,462 --> 00:30:58,396
"that Matthew took him to the
black room, so I know he is killed.

441
00:30:58,633 --> 00:31:03,493
"I want to understand the
glory of the pain like Matthew..

442
00:31:03,787 --> 00:31:09,699
"but cutting the flesh makes
him have a husband's bulge..

443
00:31:10,058 --> 00:31:11,816
"and I do not get like that."

444
00:31:11,923 --> 00:31:14,382
- Jesus. Can we not?
- No. Go on.

445
00:31:14,532 --> 00:31:15,808
- Why?
-I want to know.

446
00:31:15,884 --> 00:31:17,409
"I have found it..

447
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:21,760
"in the oldest books,
the way of saving our family.

448
00:31:22,018 --> 00:31:24,718
"My good arm is hacked up..

449
00:31:24,881 --> 00:31:27,915
"and et,
so I hope this will be readable.

450
00:31:28,099 --> 00:31:32,479
"That a believer will come
and speak this to our spirits.

451
00:31:32,744 --> 00:31:36,426
"Then we will be restored
and the great pain will return."

452
00:31:36,648 --> 00:31:40,828
And then there's something in Latin.

453
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,447
Okay, I'm drawing a line
in the fucking sand, here.

454
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,028
Do not read the Latin.

455
00:31:48,893 --> 00:31:50,016
What the fuck?

456
00:31:50,086 --> 00:31:53,010
- Dolor..
- No, no.

457
00:31:53,188 --> 00:31:55,389
- Stop being a fucking baby.
- Curt!

458
00:31:55,521 --> 00:31:56,380
It's a diary.

459
00:31:56,433 --> 00:31:58,330
It doesn't even mean anything.

460
00:31:58,444 --> 00:32:02,044
- Dana!
- "Dolor supervivo caro.

461
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:06,693
"Dolor sublimis caro.

462
00:32:06,962 --> 00:32:11,323
"Dolor ignio annivos."

463
00:32:42,463 --> 00:32:43,596
We have a winner!

464
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:45,977
It's the Buckners,
ladies and gentlemen!

465
00:32:46,118 --> 00:32:48,547
The Buckners pull a 'W'.

466
00:32:48,694 --> 00:32:54,771
All right. That means that
congratulations go to Maintenance!

467
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,727
Who share the pot
with Ronald the intern.

468
00:32:58,944 --> 00:32:59,772
Yeah!

469
00:32:59,822 --> 00:33:01,710
That's not fair. I had zombies, too.

470
00:33:01,824 --> 00:33:03,787
Yes, you did. You had zombies.

471
00:33:03,906 --> 00:33:07,136
But this is
"Zombie Redneck Torture Family," see?

472
00:33:07,331 --> 00:33:09,156
They're entirely separate species.

473
00:33:09,267 --> 00:33:11,925
Like the difference between
an elephant and an elephant seal.

474
00:33:12,086 --> 00:33:14,619
There's always next year.

475
00:33:15,568 --> 00:33:18,041
They're like something
from a nightmare.

476
00:33:18,192 --> 00:33:22,064
No. They're something
nightmares are from.

477
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:26,260
Everything in our stable
is remnant of the old world..

You get used to it.

00:33:37,293 --> 00:33:38,441
Should you?

483
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:50,084
Oh, man. I'm sorry.

484
00:33:50,182 --> 00:33:52,182
- He had the conch in his hands.
- I know.

485
00:33:52,303 --> 00:33:54,221
A couple more minutes,
who knows what might've happened?

486
00:33:54,337 --> 00:33:57,404
I am never gonna see a merman. Ever.

487
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,798
Dude, be thankful.

488
00:33:58,872 --> 00:34:00,367
Those things are terrifying.

489
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,788
And the cleanup on
them is a nightmare.

490
00:34:02,932 --> 00:34:07,380
So, the Buckners.

491
00:34:07,649 --> 00:34:11,233
Yeah, well, they may be zombified,
pain-worshipping, backwoods idiots..

492
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:14,764
But they're our zombified,
pain-worshipping, backwoods idiots.

493
00:34:14,966 --> 00:34:17,037
With a hundred percent clearance rate.

494
00:34:17,163 --> 00:34:18,788
True. So should we call Japan?

495
00:34:20,013 --> 00:34:21,707
Tell them to take the
rest of the weekend off?

496
00:34:21,811 --> 00:34:24,583
Yeah, right. They're Japanese.
What are they gonna do? Relax?

497
00:34:24,752 --> 00:34:27,128
I'd just like to see them
fall on their asses, for once.

498
00:34:27,272 --> 00:34:28,240
Oh, God, don't even joke.

499
00:34:28,303 --> 00:34:30,041
Every other branch has air-balled.

500
00:34:30,146 --> 00:34:34,028
We need the Japanese crew to get it
done. There's too much riding on this.

501
00:35:16,277 --> 00:35:17,547
Fuck, yeah, baby.

502
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,938
This is so classy.

503
00:35:20,016 --> 00:35:22,163
Come on, like you wouldn't
want a piece of that.

504
00:35:22,293 --> 00:35:25,557
Can we not talk about people
in pieces any more tonight?

505
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:29,482
Are you feeling lonely, Marty?

506
00:35:32,038 --> 00:35:35,274
Marty and I were sweeties
in our freshman hall.

507
00:35:35,472 --> 00:35:37,631
We made out once.

508
00:35:39,111 --> 00:35:40,702
I never did buy that ring.

509
00:35:40,798 --> 00:35:42,588
But we're still..

510
00:35:44,918 --> 00:35:46,248
close.

511
00:35:51,413 --> 00:35:53,326
I have a theory about all this.

512
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,260
That's our cue to bail.

513
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:58,989
Tommy Chong here has a theory.
Come on, baby.

514
00:35:59,209 --> 00:36:02,695
Don't worry,
you can tell it to Egghead, here..

515
00:36:02,906 --> 00:36:04,965
if he's not too busy
devirginizing Dana.

516
00:36:05,089 --> 00:36:07,964
Jules, do you wanna go lie down?

517
00:36:08,137 --> 00:36:11,574
That's exactly the point.
Come on. Mush. Mush.

518
00:36:11,783 --> 00:36:12,772
Don't push me around.

519
00:36:12,833 --> 00:36:14,166
Not around, baby. Straight line.

520
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,701
You seriously believe
nothing weird is going on?

521
00:36:40,179 --> 00:36:41,138
Conspiracy?

522
00:36:42,277 --> 00:36:44,017
The way everybody's acting.

523
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:47,288
Why is Jules suddenly a celebu-tard?

524
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:51,795
And since when does Curt
pull this alpha-male bullshit?

525
00:36:52,056 --> 00:36:55,074
I mean, he's a sociology major.

526
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:57,301
He's on full academic scholarship..

527
00:36:57,426 --> 00:37:00,076
and now he's calling
his friend an egghead?

528
00:37:00,237 --> 00:37:01,901
Curt's just drunk.

529
00:37:02,003 --> 00:37:04,139
I've seen Curt drunk.

530
00:37:05,367 --> 00:37:06,995
Jules, too.

531
00:37:07,094 --> 00:37:09,102
Well, then, maybe it's something else.

532
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,182
You're not seeing
what you don't wanna see.

533
00:37:16,547 --> 00:37:18,293
Puppeteers.

534
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,458
Puppeteers?

535
00:37:20,583 --> 00:37:21,687
Pop-Tarts?

536
00:37:21,754 --> 00:37:23,110
Did you say you have Pop-Tarts?

537
00:37:23,192 --> 00:37:26,786
Marty, I love you,
but you're really high.

538
00:37:28,395 --> 00:37:32,473
We are not who we are.

539
00:37:36,151 --> 00:37:39,318
I'm gonna go read
a book with pictures.

540
00:37:39,509 --> 00:37:43,584
Thank you.
- "The pain outlives the flesh.

541
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:47,744
"The flesh returns.. "
or "has a meeting place."

542
00:37:47,983 --> 00:37:49,059
What is that?

543
00:37:49,127 --> 00:37:51,880
The Latin that you
read in the basement.

544
00:37:52,046 --> 00:37:52,760
You speak Latin?

545
00:37:52,805 --> 00:37:56,751
Not well. Not since tenth grade.

546
00:37:56,991 --> 00:37:59,331
Weird how it all comes back.

547
00:37:59,474 --> 00:38:01,915
Well, it's a weird kind of night.

548
00:38:03,496 --> 00:38:04,880
I'm sorry about tonight.

549
00:38:04,962 --> 00:38:06,559
Everybody..

550
00:38:06,657 --> 00:38:10,384
Do I lose points if I tell
you I'm having a pretty nice time?

551
00:38:10,611 --> 00:38:15,349
No. You can tell me that.

552
00:38:21,515 --> 00:38:23,385
What are you running away for?

553
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,141
Don't spill on me!

554
00:38:32,247 --> 00:38:33,687
Did I get a little beer on your shirt?

555
00:38:36,662 --> 00:38:37,981
I guess it'll have to come off, huh?

556
00:38:39,577 --> 00:38:41,648
Not here.

557
00:38:43,368 --> 00:38:44,220
Baby, come on.

558
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:46,146
We're all alone.

559
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:57,864
I'm chilly.

560
00:38:59,317 --> 00:39:02,910
Okay, guys. That's it.
Let's go. We've got a job to do.

561
00:39:03,127 --> 00:39:05,870
Your basic human needs disgust me.
Get out of here.

562
00:39:06,036 --> 00:39:08,292
- Do we have temperature
control in this sector? - On it.

563
00:39:11,913 --> 00:39:16,091
Engaging pheromone mists.

564
00:39:43,008 --> 00:39:44,497
It's so dark.

565
00:39:44,586 --> 00:39:45,931
Take me inside?

566
00:39:46,012 --> 00:39:47,565
Come on. This is why we came here.

567
00:39:47,658 --> 00:39:51,172
It's romantic.

568
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:12,645
Okay, baby. Let's see some boobies.

569
00:40:12,903 --> 00:40:14,649
Show us the goods.

570
00:40:16,428 --> 00:40:18,436
Does it really matter if we see her..

571
00:40:18,557 --> 00:40:19,525
We're not the only ones watching, kid.

572
00:40:19,587 --> 00:40:21,676
Gotta keep the customer satisfied.

573
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:25,915
You understand what's at stake, here?

574
00:41:09,755 --> 00:41:10,757
Score.

575
00:41:43,606 --> 00:41:44,789
Jules!

576
00:43:01,475 --> 00:43:03,372
This we offer in humility and fear.

577
00:43:04,725 --> 00:43:07,137
For the blessed peace
of your eternal slumber.

578
00:43:07,282 --> 00:43:09,371
As it ever was.

579
00:43:09,499 --> 00:43:10,553
As it ever was.

580
00:44:01,422 --> 00:44:05,276
Nemo, man, you gotta wake up.
Your shit is topsy-turvy.

581
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:10,330
I'm gonna go for a walk.

582
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:13,708
Okay. I swear to fucking God,
somebody is talking.

583
00:44:19,163 --> 00:44:21,502
Or I'm pretty sure someone is.

584
00:44:21,644 --> 00:44:24,464
I'm gonna go for a walk.

585
00:44:24,635 --> 00:44:26,297
Enough!

586
00:44:26,399 --> 00:44:28,179
What are you saying?

587
00:44:28,286 --> 00:44:30,578
What do you want?

588
00:44:32,513 --> 00:44:35,163
You think I'm a puppet, huh?

589
00:44:35,323 --> 00:44:37,806
You think I'm a puppet.
Gonna do a little..

590
00:44:37,958 --> 00:44:40,508
fucking puppet dance!

591
00:44:40,663 --> 00:44:43,555
I'm the boss of my own brain,
so give it up.

592
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:49,506
I'm gonna go for a walk.

593
00:45:01,273 --> 00:45:02,175
I don't wanna..

594
00:45:02,231 --> 00:45:03,760
I mean, I've never..

595
00:45:03,854 --> 00:45:07,382
I don't mean "never"..

596
00:45:07,596 --> 00:45:08,440
Hey.

597
00:45:08,493 --> 00:45:10,565
Nothing you don't want.

598
00:45:15,032 --> 00:45:16,974
He's got a husband bulge.

599
00:45:35,873 --> 00:45:37,483
I thought there'd be stars.

600
00:45:42,244 --> 00:45:43,798
We are abandoned.

601
00:46:10,644 --> 00:46:12,020
- Fuck!
- Fucking run!

602
00:46:12,106 --> 00:46:12,992
Curt!

603
00:46:14,979 --> 00:46:15,991
Dead bitch!

604
00:46:20,428 --> 00:46:22,082
Jesus, what happened?

605
00:46:22,384 --> 00:46:23,094
The fuck!

606
00:46:23,138 --> 00:46:24,483
Curt, what the fuck?

607
00:46:24,565 --> 00:46:25,644
Where are you hurt?

608
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:27,022
Is all of this from you?

609
00:46:27,104 --> 00:46:28,986
It's okay! Curt, you're okay!

610
00:46:29,313 --> 00:46:30,367
Where's Jules?

611
00:46:32,071 --> 00:46:34,945
She's gone.

612
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:38,673
We've gotta get out of here.

613
00:46:38,817 --> 00:46:41,303
No. No.

614
00:46:41,454 --> 00:46:42,341
Dana, don't open that..

615
00:46:42,396 --> 00:46:43,800
I'm not leaving here without Jules.

616
00:46:43,886 --> 00:46:45,428
That dead girl's out there!

617
00:47:09,019 --> 00:47:10,064
Dana, come on!

618
00:47:15,005 --> 00:47:15,891
What is that thing?

619
00:47:15,945 --> 00:47:17,039
Fuck!

620
00:47:17,107 --> 00:47:18,386
I don't know,
but there's more of them.

621
00:47:18,463 --> 00:47:19,436
More of them?

622
00:47:19,496 --> 00:47:21,180
I saw a young girl.

623
00:47:21,282 --> 00:47:22,952
All zombied like him..

624
00:47:23,053 --> 00:47:24,961
but she was missing an arm.

625
00:47:25,076 --> 00:47:28,561
Oh, my God. Patience.

626
00:47:28,771 --> 00:47:30,570
The diary.

627
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:33,139
- We gotta lock this place down.
-He's right.

628
00:47:33,289 --> 00:47:36,294
We'll go room by room.
Barricade every window and door.

629
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:40,124
We gotta play it safe. No matter what
happens, we have to stay together.

630
00:47:40,347 --> 00:47:42,944
Fuck!

631
00:47:43,102 --> 00:47:44,031
Calm down.

632
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:46,237
Watch the master work.

633
00:47:57,227 --> 00:47:58,494
This isn't right.

634
00:47:58,574 --> 00:48:00,176
What? What's the matter?

635
00:48:00,275 --> 00:48:03,696
This isn't right. We should split up.

636
00:48:03,904 --> 00:48:06,672
We can cover more ground that way.

637
00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:08,238
Yeah.

638
00:48:09,793 --> 00:48:11,213
Yeah. Good idea.

639
00:48:12,293 --> 00:48:13,602
Really?

640
00:48:15,884 --> 00:48:17,241
All right,
you guys, get in your rooms.

641
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:22,513
Lock them in.

642
00:48:28,783 --> 00:48:31,285
What the fuck?

643
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:45,548
What the..?

644
00:48:54,232 --> 00:48:56,027
What the fuck?

645
00:48:56,137 --> 00:48:57,686
That's not good.

646
00:48:57,782 --> 00:48:59,632
Out of the way. Out of the way.
Out of the way.

647
00:48:59,745 --> 00:49:02,711
Chem department,
I need 500 CCs of Thorazine..

648
00:49:02,891 --> 00:49:04,128
pumped into room three.

649
00:49:04,202 --> 00:49:05,218
No, no, no.

650
00:49:05,281 --> 00:49:06,318
Stand by, Chem.

651
00:49:06,381 --> 00:49:09,465
Judah Buckner to the rescue.

652
00:49:13,136 --> 00:49:14,192
What the fuck?

653
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:18,914
Fuck! What the fuck?

654
00:49:22,871 --> 00:49:24,718
Oh, my God.

655
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:28,745
I'm on a reality TV show.

656
00:49:32,067 --> 00:49:35,446
My parents are gonna
think I'm such a burnout.

657
00:50:22,906 --> 00:50:26,853
Help me! Help me!

658
00:50:53,158 --> 00:50:55,046
Must be getting excited downstairs.

659
00:50:55,623 --> 00:50:57,129
Greatest show on Earth.

660
00:51:15,053 --> 00:51:16,021
Somebody help!

661
00:51:18,402 --> 00:51:19,912
Come on!

662
00:51:30,209 --> 00:51:31,657
Use the bed!
- Come on! Come on!

663
00:51:47,102 --> 00:51:49,334
It's empty.
- Go.

664
00:51:52,099 --> 00:51:53,551
Curt?
- Unlock the door.

665
00:51:53,608 --> 00:51:55,708
I can't. Get down to the basement.

666
00:52:14,141 --> 00:52:15,383
This is the black room.

667
00:52:15,458 --> 00:52:17,049
Nice.

668
00:52:20,254 --> 00:52:21,234
From the diary.

669
00:52:23,363 --> 00:52:25,158
This is where he killed them.

670
00:52:27,943 --> 00:52:29,205
This is where he kills us.

671
00:52:29,283 --> 00:52:31,226
No way. No.

672
00:52:31,343 --> 00:52:32,941
He's not gonna kill us

673
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:35,020
We just gotta find a door.

674
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:36,663
Okay?

675
00:52:40,346 --> 00:52:41,991
Let's just check the walls, okay?

676
00:52:43,271 --> 00:52:44,579
Curt?

677
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:46,454
I mean, there's gotta be..

678
00:53:03,218 --> 00:53:04,786
You like pain?

679
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:10,398
How's that work for you?

680
00:53:34,129 --> 00:53:35,839
These fucking zombies.

681
00:53:35,942 --> 00:53:37,237
Remember when you could
just throw a girl in a volcano?

682
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:38,732
How old do you think I am?

683
00:53:47,606 --> 00:53:49,194
Let's move! Come on! Come on! Go!

684
00:54:02,359 --> 00:54:03,167
What about Marty?

685
00:54:03,933 --> 00:54:04,697
They got him.

686
00:54:41,237 --> 00:54:43,492
The devil is defeated.

687
00:54:43,628 --> 00:54:46,929
Now Kiko's spirit will
live in the happy frog!

688
00:54:56,275 --> 00:54:57,338
Fuck you!

689
00:54:57,401 --> 00:55:01,152
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

690
00:55:03,543 --> 00:55:05,131
- You seeing this?
- Perfect record, huh?

691
00:55:05,542 --> 00:55:07,823
The Japan crew should've
had this in the bag. They fucked us.

692
00:55:08,303 --> 00:55:09,466
How hard is it to kill nine-year-olds?

693
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:11,757
Zero fatality. Total wash.

694
00:55:12,734 --> 00:55:16,168
You want good product,
you gotta buy American.

695
00:55:16,377 --> 00:55:18,515
Any word from downstairs?

696
00:55:18,646 --> 00:55:21,189
Downstairs doesn't care about Japan.
The director trusts us.

697
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:23,151
You just sweat the chem, Lin.

698
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:25,958
While these morons are singing
What a Friend We Have in Shinto..

699
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:28,066
we are bringing the pain.

700
00:55:28,185 --> 00:55:30,375
Yeah, and what the fuck's
up with this guy's pot, anyway?

701
00:55:30,507 --> 00:55:33,268
He's supposed to be drooling
and instead he almost makes us?

702
00:55:33,436 --> 00:55:34,764
We treated the shit out of it.

703
00:55:34,845 --> 00:55:36,933
Okay, we've got the Rambler
heading toward the tunnel.

704
00:55:37,061 --> 00:55:38,826
The fool's toast anyway.

705
00:55:38,932 --> 00:55:41,709
And so are we if you
don't get this under control.

706
00:55:41,877 --> 00:55:44,503
Shit.
- What? "Shit" why?

707
00:55:44,661 --> 00:55:45,737
Gotta go. Work to do.

708
00:55:45,803 --> 00:55:47,903
You guys are humanity's last hope.
If the ancients rise..

709
00:55:48,031 --> 00:55:50,691
There's no cave-in.
- What?

710
00:55:50,853 --> 00:55:52,241
The fucking tunnel's open!

711
00:55:52,326 --> 00:55:54,986
- Control to Demolition.
- We're dark on the whole sector.

712
00:55:55,462 --> 00:55:56,386
Try to bypass it.

713
00:55:56,424 --> 00:55:58,334
- What the fuck do you think I'm doing?
-Open the door.

714
00:56:08,919 --> 00:56:10,742
Look out!
Get out of the way! Make a hole!

715
00:56:16,312 --> 00:56:17,525
What the fuck's going on?
- We don't know.

716
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:18,991
Electrical said there
was a glitch up top.

717
00:56:19,047 --> 00:56:21,717
That tunnel should've blown hours ago.
-We didn't get the order.

718
00:56:35,643 --> 00:56:36,663
Hadley, what is going on?

719
00:56:37,309 --> 00:56:39,153
Hadley?

720
00:56:39,264 --> 00:56:41,502
Why hasn't the tunnel blown?

721
00:57:32,861 --> 00:57:36,077
No, no. No fucking way!

722
00:57:38,658 --> 00:57:40,402
Can't believe this, man.
This ain't happening.

723
00:57:40,507 --> 00:57:44,087
It's right there.

724
00:57:44,304 --> 00:57:46,655
All right.
We got any climbing gear? Ropes?

725
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:48,876
Yeah. In my fucking dorm room.

726
00:57:49,004 --> 00:57:50,548
We can't go back.

727
00:57:50,644 --> 00:57:52,410
There's no way across.

728
00:57:52,517 --> 00:57:54,035
What're we gonna do? Jump?

729
00:57:54,126 --> 00:57:56,044
Dude.

730
00:57:57,365 --> 00:57:58,656
What?

731
00:58:05,285 --> 00:58:06,447
Curt, are you sure about this?

732
00:58:06,518 --> 00:58:07,732
I've done bigger jumps than this.

733
00:58:07,807 --> 00:58:09,140
You've got a smooth run..

734
00:58:09,221 --> 00:58:11,417
and maybe a five foot
differential on the other side.

735
00:58:11,549 --> 00:58:13,325
But you've gotta give it everything.

736
00:58:13,432 --> 00:58:15,314
Curt.

737
00:58:18,807 --> 00:58:20,313
Look, you guys,
you stay in the Rambler.

738
00:58:20,404 --> 00:58:21,609
I'll get help.

739
00:58:21,683 --> 00:58:24,749
If I wipe out,
I'll fucking limp for help.

740
00:58:24,935 --> 00:58:26,991
But I'm coming back here.

741
00:58:27,116 --> 00:58:30,234
I'm coming back with
cops and choppers..

742
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:33,704
and large fucking guns,
and those things are gonna pay.

743
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:37,123
For Jules.

744
00:58:45,493 --> 00:58:47,547
Don't hold back.

745
00:58:47,674 --> 00:58:50,537
Never do.

746
00:59:15,955 --> 00:59:17,507
No!

747
00:59:19,551 --> 00:59:20,575
Curt!

748
00:59:20,941 --> 00:59:21,795
Oh, God!

749
00:59:27,175 --> 00:59:32,601
He hit something.
There's nothing. What'd he hit?

750
00:59:35,173 --> 00:59:36,294
Puppeteers.

751
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:40,171
Marty was right.

752
00:59:40,312 --> 00:59:42,064
Get in the van.

753
00:59:44,712 --> 00:59:45,628
Dana.

754
00:59:49,983 --> 00:59:52,901
Marty was right.

755
01:00:12,118 --> 01:00:13,301
You're going back.

756
01:00:13,372 --> 01:00:14,994
I'm going through.

757
01:00:15,091 --> 01:00:18,419
And we'll just drive.
There's gotta be another road.

758
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:20,109
Another way out of here.
-It won't work.

759
01:00:21,925 --> 01:00:25,518
Something will happen.
It will collapse, it will wash away.

760
01:00:25,737 --> 01:00:27,524
Then we just leave
the roads altogether.

761
01:00:27,632 --> 01:00:32,330
Drive as far as we can into the
forest and we go on foot from there.

762
01:00:34,189 --> 01:00:36,170
You're missing the point.

763
01:00:36,289 --> 01:00:40,673
Please, do not go nuts on me,
okay, Dana? You're all I've got, now.

764
01:00:44,667 --> 01:00:46,274
I'm okay.

765
01:00:46,372 --> 01:00:48,144
Good, okay, 'cause I need you calm.

766
01:00:48,254 --> 01:00:49,198
Okay, no matter what happens,
we gotta stay..

767
01:01:49,559 --> 01:01:51,420
Goddamn, that was close!

768
01:01:51,535 --> 01:01:53,233
Yeah, photo-fucking-finish.

769
01:01:53,337 --> 01:01:54,547
I don't understand.

770
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:56,266
You're celebrating?

771
01:01:56,367 --> 01:01:59,157
They're celebrating. I'm drinking.

772
01:01:59,326 --> 01:02:01,014
But she's still alive.

773
01:02:01,118 --> 01:02:01,886
How can the ritual be complete?

774
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,769
The virgin's death is optional,
as long as it's last.

775
01:02:05,592 --> 01:02:07,852
Main thing is that she suffers.

776
01:02:07,941 --> 01:02:09,418
That she did.

777
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:13,411
It's so strange.

778
01:02:15,016 --> 01:02:16,761
I'm actually rooting for this girl.

779
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:18,914
She's got so much heart.

780
01:02:19,038 --> 01:02:22,589
And you think of
all the pain and the..

781
01:02:22,803 --> 01:02:27,263
Tequila is my lady! My lady!

782
01:02:27,532 --> 01:02:30,051
Come on in, guys!
Come on in. You're welcome.

783
01:02:30,203 --> 01:02:33,576
Tequila!
From darkness, there is light!

784
01:03:41,086 --> 01:03:42,820
I wish that I could do what you do.

785
01:03:42,927 --> 01:03:45,035
Oh, my God.
-Yeah, it's masterful.

786
01:03:45,165 --> 01:03:48,447
I don't know.
Tonight was solid. I don't know.

787
01:03:48,648 --> 01:03:51,510
Are you kidding? Classic denouement.
When the van hits the lake..

788
01:03:51,685 --> 01:03:52,505
I screamed.

789
01:03:52,555 --> 01:03:54,959
And the water rushing in,
and the zombies..

790
01:03:55,105 --> 01:03:57,453
just think it would've
been cooler with a merman.

791
01:03:57,597 --> 01:04:00,022
Do you know if we get
the overtime bonus on this one?

792
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:02,532
Accounting's over there. Ask them.

793
01:04:02,674 --> 01:04:05,067
I don't need to.
I already know the answer.

794
01:04:05,212 --> 01:04:06,177
I'm an intern.

795
01:04:06,235 --> 01:04:10,646
So I don't qualify for OT.

796
01:04:10,914 --> 01:04:13,010
It's funny that you like the ballet..

797
01:04:13,136 --> 01:04:17,535
because I happen to have
two tickets to your favorite..

798
01:04:19,971 --> 01:04:21,626
You knuckleheads.

799
01:04:21,727 --> 01:04:23,883
You almost gave me a
heart attack with that tunnel.

800
01:04:24,015 --> 01:04:26,585
Like I said, it wasn't our fault.
We didn't get the order.

801
01:04:26,741 --> 01:04:28,811
I'm just giving you a hard time.

802
01:04:28,937 --> 01:04:31,965
Come on. Give us a hug.

803
01:04:32,148 --> 01:04:34,196
No, seriously. That wasn't our fault.

804
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:36,954
There was a glitch.
Power re-route from upstairs.

805
01:04:38,514 --> 01:04:40,597
What do you mean, upstairs?

806
01:04:51,905 --> 01:04:55,009
Turn the fucking music off.

807
01:05:10,069 --> 01:05:11,058
Hello?

808
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:14,013
That's impossible. Everything
was done within the guidelines.

809
01:05:14,189 --> 01:05:15,747
The virgin's the only one..

810
01:05:15,843 --> 01:05:19,061
No. I am not doubting you.

811
01:05:22,569 --> 01:05:23,540
Which one?

812
01:06:05,738 --> 01:06:07,228
Marty.
-Hi.

813
01:06:13,812 --> 01:06:15,022
Dana, come on.

814
01:06:40,668 --> 01:06:41,940
Marty. Wait.

815
01:06:42,018 --> 01:06:43,346
We're going in the grave?

816
01:06:44,806 --> 01:06:47,670
Dana, come on!

817
01:07:04,066 --> 01:07:05,225
What is this place?

818
01:07:08,670 --> 01:07:14,218
Yeah. I had to dismember
that guy with a trowel.

819
01:07:16,638 --> 01:07:17,846
What have you been up to?

820
01:07:23,676 --> 01:07:25,588
Nobody else, huh?

821
01:07:31,985 --> 01:07:33,605
Yeah, I figured.

822
01:07:35,256 --> 01:07:37,222
You figured everything.

823
01:07:37,341 --> 01:07:38,954
Oh, not at all.

824
01:07:39,054 --> 01:07:42,343
But, I do know some stuff.

825
01:07:42,544 --> 01:07:44,082
As in..

826
01:07:48,611 --> 01:07:51,222
It's an elevator.

827
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:55,311
Somebody sent those dead
fucks up here to get us.

828
01:07:55,549 --> 01:08:00,537
Now, there's no controls inside, but
there's maintenance overrides in there.

829
01:08:00,839 --> 01:08:03,211
And I think I can get it to go down.

830
01:08:04,615 --> 01:08:06,206
Do we wanna go down?

831
01:08:09,034 --> 01:08:10,715
Where else are we gonna go?

832
01:08:14,209 --> 01:08:17,821
Come on. Get in.

833
01:08:30,781 --> 01:08:31,357
Come on!

834
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:32,641
Fucking zombie arm.

835
01:10:43,021 --> 01:10:44,285
We chose.

836
01:10:44,911 --> 01:10:47,007
What? What?

837
01:10:57,806 --> 01:11:03,128
All that shit we were playing with.

838
01:11:03,450 --> 01:11:05,438
They made us choose.

839
01:11:06,845 --> 01:11:09,611
They made us choose how we die.

840
01:11:48,295 --> 01:11:50,351
We saw them go down the access drop.
They have to be in one of these.

841
01:11:51,183 --> 01:11:52,537
Internal security can..

842
01:11:52,619 --> 01:11:55,894
I don't care if it's not protocol.
Are you fucking high?

843
01:11:56,093 --> 01:11:57,303
It's the fool! Do not touch the girl.

844
01:11:57,375 --> 01:11:59,714
If he outlives her,
this whole thing goes to hell.

845
01:12:00,568 --> 01:12:01,220
Take him out first.

846
01:12:01,247 --> 01:12:03,462
Cleanup says the prep team
missed one of the kid's stashes.

847
01:12:03,906 --> 01:12:06,481
Whatever he's been smoking's
been immunizing him to all our shit.

848
01:12:06,922 --> 01:12:08,237
How does that help us right now? What?

849
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:11,052
No, if you have a confirmed kill,
take her out, too.

850
01:12:11,162 --> 01:12:12,111
There.

851
01:12:13,298 --> 01:12:15,000
3606.

852
01:12:15,545 --> 01:12:16,492
Gotcha.

853
01:12:17,627 --> 01:12:18,958
Bring 'em down.

854
01:12:37,377 --> 01:12:39,526
Step out of the elevator!
Step out of the elevator!

855
01:12:39,612 --> 01:12:42,102
Why are you trying to kill us?
- Step out! Just the girl!

856
01:12:42,199 --> 01:12:43,848
- What?
-Just me?

857
01:12:43,912 --> 01:12:44,871
Do it!

858
01:12:55,894 --> 01:12:57,435
Good work, zombie arm.

859
01:13:22,962 --> 01:13:24,134
You shouldn't be here.

860
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:28,376
This should've gone differently.

861
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:31,363
Ended more quickly.

862
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:35,515
I can only imagine
your pain and confusion.

863
01:13:35,761 --> 01:13:37,410
But know this.

864
01:13:37,509 --> 01:13:41,584
What's happening to you
is part of something bigger.

865
01:13:41,832 --> 01:13:44,171
Something older than anything known.

866
01:13:44,312 --> 01:13:48,292
You've seen horrible things.

867
01:13:48,533 --> 01:13:51,208
An army of nightmare creatures.

868
01:13:51,370 --> 01:13:54,525
But they are nothing
compared to what came before.

869
01:13:54,716 --> 01:13:56,928
What lies below.

870
01:13:58,586 --> 01:14:02,316
It's our task to placate
the ancient ones.

871
01:14:03,992 --> 01:14:06,583
As it's yours to
be offered up to them.

872
01:14:08,198 --> 01:14:09,457
Forgive us.

873
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:11,529
And let us get it over with.

874
01:14:11,652 --> 01:14:14,797
Come on. Go in that room.

875
01:14:37,073 --> 01:14:38,805
Army of nightmares, huh?

876
01:14:48,270 --> 01:14:49,660
Let's get this party started.

877
01:14:51,625 --> 01:14:52,470
Hold fire!

878
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:08,335
Oh, shit.

879
01:15:24,017 --> 01:15:25,926
Go! Go! Go!

880
01:16:38,702 --> 01:16:40,353
Lead officer Truman
to security command.

881
01:16:40,455 --> 01:16:44,457
Requesting immediate reinforcements.
Code black. I repeat, code black.

882
01:16:44,701 --> 01:16:46,386
Where the fuck are you guys?

883
01:16:46,487 --> 01:16:49,985
Sector 12, down. Sector 8, down.

884
01:16:50,198 --> 01:16:51,934
Sector 3, down. Jesus Christ!

885
01:16:52,333 --> 01:16:54,168
Why aren't the defenses working?
Where's the fucking gas?

886
01:16:54,525 --> 01:16:56,767
Something chewed through the
connections in the utility shaft.

887
01:16:56,970 --> 01:16:58,876
Something which?
- Something scary!

888
01:17:31,991 --> 01:17:33,925
The north exit is blocked.
You can't go there.

889
01:17:57,767 --> 01:17:59,211
Go, go, go!

890
01:18:50,001 --> 01:18:51,601
Fuck! We're running out of time!

891
01:18:51,853 --> 01:18:53,262
It's on lockdown,
I'm trying to bypass.

892
01:19:07,262 --> 01:19:08,250
Hadley!

893
01:19:39,277 --> 01:19:41,546
Oh, come on!

894
01:20:21,931 --> 01:20:23,045
It's you.

895
01:20:25,752 --> 01:20:31,231
No, no, no. Please, please.

896
01:20:35,546 --> 01:20:37,164
Kill him.

897
01:20:45,792 --> 01:20:46,834
Okay, Dana, come on.

898
01:20:46,898 --> 01:20:48,306
Dana.

899
01:20:51,479 --> 01:20:53,825
Here. It's easier with this.

900
01:21:58,408 --> 01:22:00,080
Look at these.

901
01:22:02,913 --> 01:22:04,897
Five of them.

902
01:22:05,018 --> 01:22:06,776
What are they?

903
01:22:09,762 --> 01:22:10,987
Us.

904
01:22:11,061 --> 01:22:13,526
I should have seen it like you did.

905
01:22:15,509 --> 01:22:17,794
This is part of a ritual.

906
01:22:17,931 --> 01:22:20,690
A ritual sacrifice?

907
01:22:23,096 --> 01:22:24,175
Great.

908
01:22:24,241 --> 01:22:29,981
You tie someone to a stone, get a
fancy dagger and a bunch of robes.

909
01:22:30,325 --> 01:22:32,645
Is that that complicated?
- No.

910
01:22:32,784 --> 01:22:34,061
It's simple.

911
01:22:34,137 --> 01:22:36,697
They don't just want to see us killed.

912
01:22:39,728 --> 01:22:41,484
They want to see us punished.

913
01:22:42,951 --> 01:22:44,219
Punished for what?

914
01:22:44,298 --> 01:22:46,632
For being young.

915
01:22:52,555 --> 01:22:55,430
It's different in every culture.

916
01:22:55,604 --> 01:22:57,898
And it has changed over the years..

917
01:22:58,037 --> 01:23:00,912
but it has always required youth.

918
01:23:01,086 --> 01:23:04,225
There must be at least five.

919
01:23:05,629 --> 01:23:07,303
The whore.

920
01:23:07,404 --> 01:23:09,037
She's corrupted.

921
01:23:09,136 --> 01:23:10,684
She dies first.

922
01:23:10,779 --> 01:23:13,589
The athlete.

923
01:23:13,758 --> 01:23:16,777
The scholar.

924
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:19,813
The fool.

925
01:23:19,919 --> 01:23:23,182
All suffer and die at the hands of..

926
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:25,718
whatever horror they have raised..

927
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:29,494
leaving the last, to live or die..

928
01:23:29,715 --> 01:23:31,993
.. as fate decides.

929
01:23:34,327 --> 01:23:35,807
The virgin.

930
01:23:37,418 --> 01:23:38,848
Me?

931
01:23:38,936 --> 01:23:40,875
Virgin?

932
01:23:40,993 --> 01:23:43,263
We work with what we have.

933
01:23:43,401 --> 01:23:46,046
But what if you don't pull it off?

934
01:23:46,205 --> 01:23:47,097
They rise.

935
01:23:47,150 --> 01:23:48,181
Who does?

936
01:23:49,559 --> 01:23:51,493
What's beneath us?

937
01:23:51,611 --> 01:23:52,959
The ancient ones.

938
01:23:53,042 --> 01:23:55,431
The gods that used to rule the Earth.

939
01:23:55,577 --> 01:23:59,527
As long as they accept
our sacrifice, they remain below.

940
01:23:59,768 --> 01:24:02,536
But the other rituals have all failed.

941
01:24:04,577 --> 01:24:06,845
The sun is coming up in eight minutes.

942
01:24:07,812 --> 01:24:11,002
If you live to see it,
the world will end.

943
01:24:11,196 --> 01:24:13,519
Maybe that's the way it should be.

944
01:24:13,661 --> 01:24:16,867
If you've got to kill all
my friends to survive..

945
01:24:17,064 --> 01:24:19,045
maybe it's time for a change.

946
01:24:19,167 --> 01:24:21,053
We're not talking about change.

947
01:24:21,168 --> 01:24:26,002
We're talking about the agonizing death
of every human soul on the planet.

948
01:24:26,293 --> 01:24:27,939
Including you.

949
01:24:28,039 --> 01:24:29,793
You can die with them..

950
01:24:31,786 --> 01:24:34,137
or you can die for them.

951
01:24:36,813 --> 01:24:39,319
Gosh, they're both so enticing.

952
01:24:57,676 --> 01:25:00,411
The whole world, Marty.

953
01:25:00,579 --> 01:25:02,627
Is in your hands, Dana.

954
01:25:02,751 --> 01:25:05,309
There is no other way.

955
01:25:05,464 --> 01:25:08,151
You have to be strong.

956
01:25:08,314 --> 01:25:10,745
Yeah, Dana..

957
01:25:12,226 --> 01:25:13,860
you feeling strong?

958
01:25:16,652 --> 01:25:18,396
I'm sorry.

959
01:25:21,963 --> 01:25:22,930
So am I.

960
01:26:06,645 --> 01:26:07,853
Marty..

961
01:26:13,146 --> 01:26:14,466
Marty!

962
01:27:07,748 --> 01:27:09,847
Hey.

963
01:27:13,204 --> 01:27:14,888
You know..

964
01:27:18,724 --> 01:27:20,873
I don't think Curt even has a cousin.

965
01:27:28,433 --> 01:27:30,372
How are you?

966
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:35,787
Going away.

967
01:27:40,543 --> 01:27:41,907
I'm sorry.

968
01:27:43,922 --> 01:27:45,958
I'm so sorry I almost shot you.

969
01:27:46,081 --> 01:27:49,169
I probably wouldn't have.

970
01:27:49,354 --> 01:27:51,029
Hey, no. No.

971
01:27:53,815 --> 01:27:54,858
I totally get it.

972
01:28:07,704 --> 01:28:12,029
I'm sorry I let you get attacked by
a werewolf and then ended the world.

973
01:28:13,836 --> 01:28:14,617
No.

974
01:28:16,118 --> 01:28:17,838
Hey, you were right.

975
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:21,070
Humanity..

976
01:28:27,924 --> 01:28:30,888
It's time to give
someone else a chance.

977
01:28:43,392 --> 01:28:45,502
Giant evil gods.

978
01:28:50,962 --> 01:28:53,649
I wish I could've seen them.

979
01:28:53,812 --> 01:28:55,187
I know.

980
01:28:57,604 --> 01:29:00,490
That would have been a fun weekend.

981
01:29:00,664 --> 01:29:35,933
