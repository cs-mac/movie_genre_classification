1
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,059
Indecipherable yelling

2
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,120
Dick.

3
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,520
How long was I out for?

4
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,499
Just about two days.

5
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:55,860
Do try to take better care of yourself…
Pennyworth.

6
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,320
Good ole Alfred.

7
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,440
So I guess...

8
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,720
Thanks.

9
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,669
It wasn’t me.

10
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,720
What do you mean it wasn’t you, I saw you?

11
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,120
I’ve been on league business for the past
several weeks. Barbara found you on your balcony.

12
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,820
So you’re saying I have a guardian
angel who knows where I live?

13
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,171
Super.

14
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,420
How’s your wound?

15
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,780
Fine. What’s this supposed to be, Bruce?

16
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,290
An open hand.

17
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,920
It’s… a long trip from the watchtower.

18
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,400
When were you going to
tell me about Barbara?

19
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,660
We had to convince the Joker
that she was dead.

20
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,980
But after? Well, Afterward she
had her own reasons.

21
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,920
You didn’t have to lie to me.

22
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,641
No, I didn’t. But I kept her secret because
that’s what Barbara wanted.

23
00:03:05,641 --> 00:03:07,641
Imagine being where she was.

24
00:03:07,642 --> 00:03:10,842
 As far as she was concerned,
she did die that night.

25
00:03:10,843 --> 00:03:13,143
I gave her time to find herself.

26
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:18,650
You seriously think that justifies
what you two did?!

27
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,110
I can and have made mistakes before.

28
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,740
Is that was Jason is? Just a mistake?

29
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,440
When Jason died I almost hung it up.

30
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:37,239
I was wrong, to try and
replace you so soon.

31
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:43,470
The truth is, you were right to
leave and I was upset.

32
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,739
You asking me to forgive you?

33
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:48,660
I don’t expect that. But I’m not going
to be around forever.

34
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,660
We both know Batman can’t die.

35
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,800
Batman won’t. But Bruce Wayne will.

36
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:59,801
 When It comes, someones going to
have to take up the mantle.

37
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,220
There’s only one person I trust
to do that.

38
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,610
I got my ass kicked the other night.

39
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,300
You made a mistake.

40
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,670
I can barely stand on my own let alone...

41
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:11,070
You rushed in head first without
knowing your enemy.

42
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,670
You have a secret weapon, Dick.

43
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:20,510
Use it. You’re a detective.
It’s who we are...

44
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,229
It’s what we do.

45
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,260
You’re going to be way better at this life
than I ever was.

46
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:37,080
Justice league. This is Superman. We’ve got
a league-wide alert. Departure in 15 minutes.

47
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,879
I can’t stay.

48
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,120
I can’t do this alone.

49
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,220
You can. You’re my son.

50
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,220
Now grab your gear
and be a detective.

51
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,320
Have you seriously been
their the entire time?!

52
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,080
Short answer?

53
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,760
Yes.

54
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,740
Grab my gear and be a detective?

55
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,480
What?

56
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,320
I remember he was wearing
dog tags the other night.

57
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,920
"Accessing archived Footage”

58
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,660
Dick, he could have killed you.

59
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,200
I screwed up. Got cocky.

60
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,200
Won’t happen again.

61
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,480
Oracle, Isolate text.

62
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:53,840
Slade wilson? Oracle, cross-reference the
name “Slade Wilson” with all American...

63
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:57,050
military personnel from the last 40 years.

64
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:08,800
- Barbara look I shouldn’t have...
- Dick I’m sorry, I...

65
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,600
“Match found”

66
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,680
S.H.A.D.E.? Never heard of them?

67
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,860
I have.

68
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,740
This is a high level encryption. This is
going to take at least an hour for us...

69
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,240
Got it.

70
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,759
What? You think I spent the last three
years crying in a closet somewhere?

71
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,960
Apparently not...

72
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,220
S.H.A.D.E. Super Human Advanced
Defense Endeavor.

73
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:42,120
They were the militaries first response to
meta-humans. They wanted to form their own

74
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:47,460
meta-army. This is some high level stuff.

75
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:54,039
Slade Wilson. Highly decorated from a young
age? So Deathstroke was an army Vet.

76
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,740
Not just a veteran. S.H.A.D.E. recruited
him for a meta-enhanced soldier project.

77
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,270
Codenamed: Team Seven.

78
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,960
They injected him full of drugs to increase
his brain performance.

79
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,900
Dramatically improved his reflexes,
pumped him full of steroids.

80
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,560
Our government built Deathstroke.

81
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,740
And then lost control of him.

82
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,139
Team Seven’s Administrators.

83
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,180
These are the guys who built Deathstroke.

84
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,840
Looks like after S.H.A.D.E. fell apart most of these
guys left the military and set up shop in Bludhaven.

85
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,940
He’s been killing off his past.

86
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,140
And there’s only one man left alive.

87
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,500
Are you going out?

88
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,280
Barbara, Mayor Redhorn is the last man left
on that list. If we don’t stop Deathstroke

89
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,990
now… we may not get another chance.

90
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:46,650
You’re not exactly in the best shape?

91
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,140
It’s who we are.. it’s what we do, right?

92
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,191
Fine but I’ll be with you the entire time.

93
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,330
Oh, so I guess I’m calling you
Oracle for the night?

94
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,300
Yeah, I actually kind of like that.

95
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,160
I don’t care if they’re going to be upset. You
have to clear my appearances. All of them.

96
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,760
We’ve had this meeting with LexCorp on the books for months.

97
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,240
Airport, Step on it.

98
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:20,800
Is the plane ready? Who’s name did you book
the reservation under? Relax?!

99
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:27,840
You have no idea who you’re dealing with here!
You need to have eyes in the back of your head.

100
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,240
Hey, we just passed our exit!

101
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,909
Yeah, we had to go ahead and make a coupleof
changes in your itinerary Mr. Mayor. Sorry about that.

102
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,960
Would you kindly take your cellphone and toss
it out the window?

103
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,440
Thank you.

104
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,000
Got a trace on Redhorns phone! Looks like
he’s on his way out of town.

105
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,080
That’s my cue.

106
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,560
Be careful.

107
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,280
Never.
