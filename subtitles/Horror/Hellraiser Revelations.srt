00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,311
- [man 1] Did you bring the beers?
- [man 2] Yes.

4
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,475
Can you get a shot of downtown LA
before we... say good bye to it forever?

5
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:52,716
[man 2] Bye, LA!

6
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:55,812
[man 1 ] The plan is to get,
to get your dick wet.

7
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,413
All right?

8
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,617
- Is that OK with you?
- Fuck yeah.

9
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:01,023
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

10
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:03,722
I swear I won't tell your mother.

11
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,765
Or... or Emma.

12
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,026
[man 2] Don't tell her.

13
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,434
- [man 1] I'll never say a word.
- Should we... Should we...

14
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:12,869
...divulge all of it or not.

15
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:16,841
All of the times that
I've picked your drunk ass up.

16
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:21,472
All of the times when
you've been looking for...

17
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:24,381
- ...a little bit of...
- For a rubber? Yeah?

18
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,282
[both laugh]

19
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:27,944
[man 2] You always gotta
get back to my sister.

20
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:30,512
Don't, don't fuck with me.
Are we rolling?

21
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,082
This is gonna be an epic journey.
My name is Nico Bradley

22
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,390
and this is my best friend,
Steven Craven.

23
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:39,023
We're about to get laid.
Multiple times over.

24
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,566
[Steven] At Disneyland?

25
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:44,069
You can get laid at Disneyland.
But we're not going to Disneyland.

26
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:45,764
And when were you gonna tell me this?

27
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,034
[Nico] I was gonna,
I was gonna tell you at the border.

28
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,338
At... the Mexican border?!

29
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,208
- Yo! Yes! Yes!
- No way.

30
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,543
- Donkey show in Tijuana!
- What?

31
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,311
- Tijuana! Yeah!
- No.

32
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:00,784
- Yo!
- Bullshit. That shit's all fake.

33
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,653
Truth or urban legend?

34
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:05,486
Urban legend, all the way.

35
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:07,617
No. It's the truth, baby.

36
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:10,254
All right, I say we hit
the main drag in Tijuana,

37
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,493
and we bang the first bow-legged hooker
we can find.

38
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:15,557
- Screw that. I wanna get wasted.
- Oh!

39
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,468
Do you hear that, Mrs. Craven?
Steven wants to get wasted.

40
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:21,268
Dude, stop it. That's not cool.
Not cool.

41
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,933
- It's OK. It's OK.
- Turn it off.

42
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:25,510
- Little Stevie's gonna get wasted.
- No.

43
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:29,708
It's OK, Mommy dearest, we're gonna
get his knob gobbled before midnight.

44
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:31,511
[Steven] Be cool. Turn it off.

45
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:32,608
[Nico] Fuck, dude!

46
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:34,915
The fucking car, man,
it's been jacked!

47
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,388
I don't believe this!
I don't fucking believe this!

48
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:38,446
Look at this shit!

49
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:41,221
Why don't we get the fuck outta here?

50
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:43,421
Turn the fucking camera off, dude.

51
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:57,634
[Nico] Hey, Steven...

52
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:02,579
- I think I got it.
- Show me.

53
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,980
[bell tolling]

54
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,420
- [distant boom]
- [Steven] What was that?

55
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,331
It's Mexico, bro.
Tons of churches.

56
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,458
[rumbling]

57
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,195
No, that's not the churches.

58
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:25,731
Whoa.

59
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:28,730
What the fuck is going on?

60
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,633
[Nico] Who the fuck are you
and what do you want?!

61
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,645
[Pinhead] The box.

62
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,204
Take it, it's yours.
Just get the fuck outta here.

63
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,147
- No.
- [Steven] Nico!

64
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,415
[Pinhead] You opened it.
Summoned us.

65
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:44,149
- And we came.
- Came for what?! Who the fuck are you?!

66
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,385
- [Pinhead] We came for you, Nico.
- [panting]

00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,893
We are the light in the darkness,

68

and paths to higher sensation.

69
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:55,059
Guardians of ultimate experience.

70
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:58,069
- And now you will come with us.
- What?

71
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,537
What? No, no, no!
I'm not going anywhere! No!

72
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,733
Go on, get outta here.

73
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,743
- Help me, man, help!
- [screaming]

74
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,185
I thought so.
That's Steven's.

75
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,189
It's nothing.

76
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,417
You know, you keep saying that,

77
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:21,119
but this is the third time
I found you looking at it.

78
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:23,458
- Can I see?
- It's nothing.

79
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,353
Whatever.

80
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,726
Dad said to come get you.

81
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,360
- He just buzzed the Bradleys in.
- I'll be right there.

82
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,345
Ha-ha!

83
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,410
[indistinct chatter]

84
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:56,855
- [man] Hey, where's your mom, sweetie?
- She's, uh... in Steven's room.

85
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,896
- Hey!
- Hi.

86
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,331
How's Sarah doing?

87
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,426
Oh, you know,
she has some days better than others.

88
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,994
She's not exactly her old self, but...

89
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,569
- Go on, Ross.
- Why don't I open a bottle, huh?

90
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,134
- Yeah.
- Great idea.

91
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:19,250
[man] Mmm-mm. You've really
outdone yourself, Ross.

92
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,843
Excellent, excellent meal.

93
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,012
Thank you.

94
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:24,249
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

95
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,655
Cheers, honey.

96
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:32,989
So, more wine?

97
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,465
Sure.

98
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,699
Do you have to ask?

99
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:40,830
- Nice try.
- Come on, Dad.

100
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,875
Can't a girl live a little?

101
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,777
We all know where that got our boys.

102
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,836
- Peter, not now.
- What?

103
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,882
We talked about this.

104
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,883
[woman] You know, I don't really get it.

105
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:55,284
You guys, you sit around,
you have your gourmet meals,

106
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,550
and you pretend
like there's nothing wrong.

107
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:00,091
But you never talk about
Steven and Nico.

108
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:03,061
- Emma!
- [man] She's right.

109
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:06,531
We've always avoided the subject.

110
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,034
Now's not the time.

111
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,627
Why don't we ever talk about them?

112
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,070
- Emma, please.
- [Emma] "Please" what, Dad?

113
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,732
Please forget that I had a brother?

114
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:19,039
Please forget that my boyfriend
disappeared with him?

115
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,039
You know what? I wanna talk about it
and I wanna talk about it now.

116
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,244
- [man] Me too.
- Good!

117
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,015
I mean, you hired a Pl, right?

118
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,680
And, well, what did he find?

119
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:35,694
Why is Mom always in Steven's room?
Like what is on that video camera?

120
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:36,786
Shut up!

121
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,386
Shut up!

122
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:41,900
[man] Excellent work, Emma.

123
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,334
- Maybe you should go to your room.
- [Emma] I'm not a child.

124
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,099
[man] Then why do you behave like one?

125
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,697
An adult would've shown some sympathy
and kindness towards your mother

126
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:51,209
instead of worrying about herself
the whole time.

127
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:54,769
Save the shrink talk
for your clients, Dad.

128
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,112
Fucking assholes.

129

This just in.

There is no better buzz
than a tequila buzz.

- That is true. In all of Mexico.

- Tijuana!

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,625
[Steven] I do some more shots here.
They don't want that in there.

136
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,892
- Shots!
- [Nico] Shots!

137

- Viva la Tijuana!
- Viva la Mexico!

159
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,361
[Nico] OK, here we go.

160
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,301
[Nico] Oh, yeah.

161
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,699
- Thumbs up.
- [Steven] That is gross.

162
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:02,502
- Like a champ. Like a pro.
- That is awful.

163
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,543
That's what I'm talking about.

164
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,134
I think she likes being videotaped.

165
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,305
I think she does.
Do you like being videotaped?

166
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,643
You wanna be videotaped?

167
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,878
- Do you like being videotaped?
- No, we're not going to do that.

168
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,476
- Why not?
- 'Cause you won't be there.

169
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,112
I'm not gonna do that
with you around.

170
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:17,177
[laughs]

171
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,889
[banging]

172
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,052
[Steven] Nico?

173
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:24,993
Nico?

174
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,591
- [panting]
- What the fuck, man?!

175
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,295
That's my girlfriend, dude!

176
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,465
Fuck you, dude.

177
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:36,074
You always do this to me, Nico.

178
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,838
[muttering]

179
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:39,900
Fuck.

180
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,647
Oh, fuck.
[coughs]

181
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:44,910
Got it almost there.

182
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,975
[panting]

183
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,842
Oh, my God.

184
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,910
[Steven] Oh, shit.

185
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:25,452
- Get up, Stevie.
- How much did I drink?

186
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:28,982
Get the fuck up. Come on, come on,
come on. I wanna go. Let's go.

187
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:31,427
- Where's the chick?
- Doesn't matter.

188
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,055
Was she like totally into you?

189
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:37,596
Oh, shit. She was a hooker.

190
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,161
[chuckling] Fucking puta.

191
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,833
Come on, I wanna get some breakfast,
let's go. Let's go! [snaps fingers]

192
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,468
How much did she cost you, dude?

193
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:51,606
- Oh, shit! Oh, she's still here!
- [Nico shouts]

194
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:55,576
[Steven] Gotta get my lame ass up.

195
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,249
Yeah. Come on, OK, let's go.

196
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:01,053
Come on, let's get out the door.
Right now.

197
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:02,651
[Steven] OK!

198
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,496
Is she OK?

199
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,965
Hey?

200
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:16,940
What did you do?

201
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,005
What the fuck did you do?!

202
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,571
I didn't do anything.
It was a total accident, OK?!

203
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:26,914
Accident? You guys were fucking.
She's fucking dead!

204
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,284
- How is that an accident?
- I don't know, OK?!

205
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,119
I don't know what happened, she hit
her head or something. I don't know!

206
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,056
I was drunk. So were you.

207
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,990
We gotta tell the cops, dude.

208
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,964
What, are you fucking crazy, man?!

209
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,227
You know what they do
to gringos in Mexico?

210
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,997
- You said it was an accident.
- That's not what it looks like.

211
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,733
You wanna spend the rest of your life
in a Mexican prison, that's fine with me

212
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:48,899
but I don't want to!

213
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,601
I didn't have
anything to do with this.

214
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:52,303
Really? That's not what it looks like.

215
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,812
Check the video.
You're an accomplice now, motherfucker.

216
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,077
- I didn't do anything, Nico!
- You picked her up.

217
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:01,551
You filmed us fucking. How do you think
that's gonna look in a jury?

218
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:04,215
If they even have
juries in Mexico. Fuck!

219
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,424
- Take this...
- What're you doing?

220
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,962
I'm deleting this.

221
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,554
You're not fucking deleting shit.

222
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:14,360
We've gotta delete that!

223
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:16,427
No.

224
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,130
Not destroying it
keeps us on the same team.

225
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:24,966
Dude, I would never do anything.

226
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:30,140
I would never do anything like that,
Nico. Come on.

227
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:51,902
[Ross] You know,
maybe she's right. Emma.

228
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:56,203
- Maybe we should all talk about it.
- What is there to discuss?

229
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:00,876
You talked to the police. Someone
killed them. They were murdered.

230
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,881
- Well, we don't know that for sure.
- Watch the damn video.

231
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:07,077
Guys, guys... Iook Ross is right.

232
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,849
Who knows what that video means.

233
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:13,915
- The cops couldn't even figure it out.
- Could we... not talk about it, please?

234
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,052
Could we just remember them
the way they were?

235
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,858
Not the way they were killed?

236
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:21,058
Did Nico give any indication
that he was gonna leave?

237
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:25,629
He never...
he never really talked about it.

238
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,434
He'd just started dating Emma.

239
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:31,442
He was happy. I mean...

240
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:34,569
And then he just sort of...

241
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:37,772
Went cold?

242
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,462
I just don't understand why he left.

243
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,035
He had everything.

244
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:04,504
A great family... Shit, he had
the whole fucking world on a string.

245
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,240
Why would he just run off?

246
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:11,477
Why?

247
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,445
[sniffs, moans]

248
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:22,853
I mean, did Emma say something to him,
or did she break up with him?

249
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,502
Oh, Emma, I didn't mean to suggest...

250
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:41,773
Good job, honey. Outstanding.

251
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:44,673
It was just a question.

252
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,463
[Nico] Who the fuck are you
and what do you want?!

253
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:04,695
[Pinhead] The box.

254
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,169
You opened it.

255
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,867
Summoned us. And we came.

256
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,454
[screaming]

257
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,264
[Emma screams]

258
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:37,394
Guys, it's Steven!

259
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:43,567
- Dad, Dad!
- Peter, give me a hand!

260
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,402
- Emma?
- Yeah?

261
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:46,739
- Go call 911.
- OK.

262
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:50,771
Oh, God! Steven, where's Nico?!

263
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:52,510
Is he out there?

264
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:54,675
Nico?

265
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:01,925
Are you out here? Nico?

266
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,955
I don't think he's hurt.

267
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,262
Come on, bro.

268
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,830
I don't think this is his blood.

269
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,601
- Are they on the way?
- No, phone's not working, line's dead.

270
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:18,938
Shit.

271
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:21,674
- Try my cell?
- [man] No signal.

272
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:23,510
That's why we keep a landline.

273
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,846
- [woman] Neighbors, maybe?
- Four miles.

274
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:29,046
- I'm gonna have to drive him.
- Let's use my car. I'll get it started.

275
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,596
It's all right, Steven.
Save your energy.

276
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,964
[grunting, sputtering]

277
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:46,562
Don't... Iet them... find me.

278
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,607
I won't go back.

279
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,872
- I can't go back.
- Steven, it's OK. You're safe now.

280
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,709
- You're safe now.
- Where's my son?!

281
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,715
Where is he? Is he with you?

282
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,775
Emma...

283
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:09,326
They're gone. The cars are gone.

284
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:10,623
Shit.

285
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,022
Emma, go get me some blankets.

286
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,033
- OK.
- I'll go with you.

287
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:17,659
What's wrong with him?

288
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,230
Exhaustion, dehydration.

289
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,740
We just gotta keep him stabilized.

290
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:27,938
Keep him warm.
Get some fluids into him.

291
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,085
- What the hell is happening here, man?
- I don't know.

292
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:40,615
But whoever Steven is afraid of has
now taken out the phone and the cars.

293
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,592
He's probably out there right now.

294
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:48,292
All right... All right, look.

295
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,892
He said something about not,
not going back.

296
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,561
Not going back where?

297
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,272
I mean, do you think
he's been kidnapped?

298
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:59,799
We're not gonna find any answers
from Steven until he recovers.

299
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,904
Let him rest,
we can ask him questions in the morning.

300
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:05,883
What? Fuck that, man,
I want some answers now!

301
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,351
- Steven! Talk to me!
- [woman] Stop it!

302
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,389
Would you all calm
the fuck down right now?!

303
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:12,583
[woman sobs]

304
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:14,421
- All right.
- Calm.

305
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,260
- Easy.
- I'm sorry.

306
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:21,225
It's OK.

307
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:25,466
If that was Nico and Steven
was still missing, I'd be upset too.

308
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:30,130
But... we're all on our own now.

309
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:33,576
So we just have to stay calm
and take care of Steven.

310
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:34,839
- All right?
- All right.

311
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:37,905
I'll make a run to the highway in the
morning. It's too dangerous in the dark.

312
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,951
You really think someone's out there?

313
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,248
Do you have a gun?

314
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,922
- Yeah.
- What?

315
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,918
All right, I'm gonna get the gun,
you guys check the windows and doors.

316
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:53,521
[man] OK, good idea.

317
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:44,811
How we doing?

318
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,339
Uh...

319
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:50,218
Good. All the doors
and windows are locked.

320
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,655
So what're you planning
on doing with that anyway?

321
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,282
I'll do whatever I have to.

322
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,156
Hell, I'll shoot anyone
who comes close.

323
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,490
- You're drunk, Peter.
- So what?

324
00:19:57,563 --> 00:20:00,123
So I don't want any accidents happening.

325
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,794
All right, fine. But if it comes down
to it, you'd better not hesitate.

326
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,137
How is he?

327
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,675
Out cold.

328
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:13,233
Let him sleep.
It's the best thing for him now.

329
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:16,337
Strong pulse.

330
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:25,182
- You OK?
- No, not really.

331
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,225
He's back, Sarah.

332
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:35,763
I'm sorry about earlier.

333
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,529
No, you don't have to apologize.

334
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,807
I can't believe he's here.

335
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,668
Neither can l.

336
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,915
And he just turns up
after all this time.

337
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:06,661
Birth... is pain.

338
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:11,860
- Each nail...
- [man grunting in pain]

339
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:15,839
...each new square of flesh...

340
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:21,436
...wrenches you further from the fleshy
existence you knew before.

341
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:26,007
- [screams]
- Mmm...

342
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,426
[exhales]

343
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,335
What you got there, Em?

344
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:47,329
Puzzle box.

345
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:48,873
Where did you get that?

346
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,602
You know where I got it.

347
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:54,737
You've been in the bag?

348
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:58,874
Wait a minute. Is that the thing
Nico was playing with in the video?

349
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,748
Yeah, it is. Why do you have it?

350
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:04,312
You guys never told us you...
that was found in their bags.

351
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:09,224
It opens. If I could just...
figure it out.

352
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:14,890
[rumbling]

353
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:18,296
It's an earthquake.
Everyone just stay calm.

354
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,860
[frightened chatter]

355
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:22,462
[Emma] Oh, my God!

356
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:25,806
Dad... what's happening?

357
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,884
- What the...
- What the hell is going on?!

358
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:43,024
- [Emma] Oh, no.
- [hammering]

359
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,108
Ross... why?

360
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,200
It is almost time.

361
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:05,080
- I'm scared. I don't understand.
- [Emma] Oh, God. Oh, my God.

362
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,378
[glass breaks]

363
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,179
[Emma] What was that?

364
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:12,951
Oh, my gosh, I'm scared.

365
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,253
Where's Steven?

366
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:19,123
Oh, where is he?
Steven?!

367
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:20,755
- Steven!
- Hey, hey, hey!

368
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,026
- Where did he go?
- Hey, hey.

369
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,260
- Calm down.
- But where is he?!

370
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:26,498
Everything's gonna be fine.
Come on, we'll find him.

371
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,766
OK, I'll go this way.

372
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:35,477
Steven?

373
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:40,545
[Ross] He's here. He's outside.

374
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:54,694
Why is he just standing there?

375
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:58,831
Steven?

376
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,642
Steven?

377
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,413
They're coming.

378
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:14,343
The ones that creepy bastard...

379
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:17,445
...that vagrant, called the Cenobites.

380
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,285
What vagrant?

381
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,893
Who are the Cenobites?

382
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:27,796
He said they could take the pain away.

383
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,102
He said they would
show us something different.

384
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,772
Something better.

385
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,708
Something beyond the limits.

386
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:04,825
Good times.

387
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,401
You got a better idea?

388
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,978
Yeah, I do.
How about anything?

389
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:21,545
What if they find our fingerprints?

390
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,521
When do you think
that shithole was last cleaned?

391
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:30,116
Trust me. Thing's got prints
dating back to the last ice age.

392
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:33,831
Besides, life's cheap down here.

393
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:37,027
There's probably something
like 100 killings a week.

394
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:39,093
She's already just a number.

395
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,437
A statistic.

396
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,506
Whoa, we're not looking
for any new friends, amigo.

397
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,073
Comprende?

398
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:56,814
It seems to me you could
use a friend right now.

399
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,286
- You think?
- Well...

400
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,158
A rat hole like this...

401
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:07,858
...a couple of preppies...

402
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:12,803
...reeking of... [sniffs]
privilege.

403
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,900
Tells me you... need a way out.

404
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:21,339
- Or a way in.
- Sir, whatever it is you're selling,

405
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,745
no thank you.

406
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,287
What's that?

407
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:37,658
Experience.

408
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:41,596
Yeah, well, we've had
enough of that for this trip.

409
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:43,725
Hold on. Experience?

410
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:47,932
Oh, it's a form of ultimate arousal.

411
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:49,439
[Nico] What, like sex?

412
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:53,769
No, it's better than that.
It's better than sex.

413
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:56,746
- Better than sex?
- Sex has limits.

414
00:26:58,617 --> 00:26:59,606
So does killing.

415
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,751
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

416
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:09,152
This will take you beyond the limits.

417
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:13,596
To places you can't
even begin to imagine.

418
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:16,725
- Sensual pain.
- Hold on.

419
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:20,259
Pain? What, like bondage and shit?

420
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:21,828
Let me ask you something.

421
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:27,636
How can we experience ultimate pleasure,

422
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:30,340
without experiencing ultimate pain?

423
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:33,407
How can we taste the truly sweet,

424
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,248
without a little bit of the sour?

425
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,254
Wow, man, that's some beautiful poetry,

426
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,222
but if you don't mind,
we're gonna get out of here.

427
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,781
[man] Death is a finality.

428
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:46,930
There's no beauty in that...
as you both know.

429
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,592
All right, listen,
I don't know where this is going...

430
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,535
How many people
have you known who've...

431
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:55,539
...come close to death and survived?

432
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:59,839
Every day for them is the best day ever.

433
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:03,107
Every sensation a symphony.

434
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,976
That's what this does.

435
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,386
That's what they offer.

436
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:12,787
Who?

437
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,188
The Cenobites.

438
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:17,786
The what?

439
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:21,662
Angels... prayers...

440
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:25,335
...conductors...

441
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:27,837
...surgeons, and more.

442
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,816
The box...

443
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:46,715
...how does it work?

444
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:51,558
Open it... and you'll find out.

445
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:54,087
How much do you want for it?

446
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:58,058
Oh, it's not for sale.

447
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:00,933
It's yours already, Nico.

448
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,735
It always was.

449
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:08,040
You see, they've been
watching you, Nico.

450
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,564
Would you put that away?

451
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:33,467
Put it away!

452
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,673
That homeless fuck
really creeped me out.

453
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:38,265
It's just a puzzle.

454
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:41,938
The prize is probably
two free passes to the donkey show.

455
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:44,345
OK, haven't you done
enough shit for one trip?

456
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,315
In a word? No.

457
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:49,080
All right, well I have.
I'm calling my parents in the morning

458
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:51,418
and they're gonna wire me
enough money so I can get home.

459
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:55,050
- You would.
- What is that supposed to mean?

460
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,424
Exactly what you think it means.
You're weak.

461
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:58,655
You always were.

462
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,961
You let your parents cut your balls off
at every single turn.

463
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:04,160
And you just sit there
and you take it.

464
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:06,100
- Screw you.
- Truth hurts, Steve-o.

465
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,708
- Hey!
- What? You suck at puzzles anyways.

466
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,937
It's not a skill thing.

467
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,376
- Yeah? How do you know?
- I just do.

468
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:19,673
Besides, the dude gave it to me.

469
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:21,810
You wanna be helpful,
go get the camera.

470
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:24,582
No. I'm not shooting another thing.

471
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,090
- What if something whack happens?
- I don't give a shit!

472
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,353
Well I do, so get the fucking camera!

473
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:42,831
Hey, Steven...

474
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:46,769
- I think I got it.
- Show me.

475
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:54,174
[bell tolling]

476
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,844
[distant boom]

477
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:01,585
What was that?

478
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:05,762
It's Mexico, dude,
there's churches everywhere.

479
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,058
[rumbling]

480
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:10,327
No, that's not the churches.

481
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:12,829
Oh...

482
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,938
What the fuck is going on?

483
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:18,903
[Nico] Who the fuck are you
and what do you want?!

484
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:20,569
[Pinhead] The box.

485
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:23,512
Take it, it's yours.
Just get the fuck outta here.

486
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:25,412
- No.
- Nico!

487
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:28,680
You opened it.
Summoned us.

488
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:31,415
- And we came.
- Came for what?! Who the fuck are you?!

489
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:32,751
We came for you, Nico.

490
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:34,655
No, no, no!
I'm not going anywhere. No!

491
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:35,988
Go on, get outta here.

492
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,029
[Pinhead] This is not a matter
for negotiation.

493
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:40,621
Steven!

494
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:42,894
[screaming]

495
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,866
Steven!

496
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:51,266
Where's Nico?
Did he come back?

497
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:54,175
- I don't know.
- What do you mean "you don't know"?

498
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:57,214
Everything's gonna be OK, sweetheart.

499
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:58,715
You just need a little time.

500
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:02,115
Did he try to escape with you, too?

501
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:03,620
Did you help him?

502
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:06,020
Please tell me where my son is.

503
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:13,055
He... he didn't want to come back.

504
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:15,122
He wanted to stay.

505
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:24,668
Where are you going?

506
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:28,943
You have $100 on you?

507
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:33,483
- Yeah.
- Do you wanna go home with me?

508
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:38,187
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

509
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,731
[breathing heavily]

510
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:53,828
[Nico] Kill her, Steven.

511
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,059
I need blood.

512
00:33:58,169 --> 00:33:59,158
Help me.

513
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,398
- [grunting]
- Stop!

514
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:03,633
[Nico] Help me, Steven.

515
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,767
It's the only way. Kill her!

516
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,606
Get the fuck off!

517
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,041
[whimpers]

518
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:16,450
[shouts]

519
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:21,848
[panting]

520
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:38,902
Steven! Her blood brought me back.

521
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:43,246
Bring me more.

522
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:55,618
They're coming.

523
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:57,251
"They"?

524
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:59,853
The Cenobites.

525
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:02,592
They don't like to lose souls.

526
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,258
What do they want?

527
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:16,305
They want to experience your flesh.

528
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:19,873
[all gasping, grunting]

529
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,475
Peter, help me.

530
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,278
OK.

531
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,944
So, Cenobite, it says here:

532
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:58,079
"A member of a religious group
living together

533
00:35:58,189 --> 00:35:59,884
in a monastic community."

534
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:02,984
- What?
- Cenobite, it's the word Steven said.

535
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,255
I'd never heard it before,
so I looked it up.

536
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,728
A monastic community.

537
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:17,866
Do you think it's an antique?

538
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:20,633
Maybe they stole it?

539
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:22,140
[panting, whimpering]

540
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:25,572
[screaming]

541
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,081
No!

542
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:45,494
Pain and pleasure.

543
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:48,835
Indivisible.

544
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:57,747
- Dad?!
- It's all right, Steven.

545
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:00,040
It's all right.

546
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:05,314
- Why did you wander outside?
- Outside?

547
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,380
You were outside, honey.

548
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:09,420
I was?

549
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:11,688
How are you feeling?

550
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:13,457
Better.

551
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:16,762
- Hungry.
- Some soup, maybe?

552
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:19,235
Please.

553
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,473
Let's get you back into bed.

554
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:29,712
You OK, son?

555
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,482
These people are bad?

556
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,823
- And the box?
- Where is it?

557
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:43,451
We have it. What is it?

558
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:49,359
- A key.
- To what?

559
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:54,801
I'm not sure.

560
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:57,340
Well, then why do you want it so badly?

561
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:02,136
I don't know.

562
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,204
- Dad?
- It's OK.

563
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,773
We're gonna take care of this.

564
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:10,116
And you'll help me?
Promise you'll help me.

565
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:12,212
- Swear it.
- I swear.

566
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,657
We're gonna get through this. Whatever
you need we're gonna take care of.

567
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:19,923
We're just glad to have you home.

568
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:22,727
- It's good to be home.
- Yeah.

569
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,893
Now you rest, OK?

570
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,732
I'll go get you some food.

571
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:39,440
- I give up.
- You're trying too hard.

572
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:43,785
- You're trying too hard.
- Really?

573
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:50,225
It's like it wants to open,

574
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:53,460
but you have to want it as well.

575
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,863
If you try to force it...

576
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:00,531
...then nothing happens.

577
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:04,767
You have to just let go.

578
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:11,537
[breathing heavily]

579
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:23,623
You have to desire it.

580
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:31,159
Emma.

581
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,434
Take this to your brother.

582
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:38,799
You don't need that.

583
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:26,220
- You're stealing my soup?
- Shit.

584
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,552
You're awake.

585
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:36,499
Don't go.

586
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:38,528
Stay with me.

587
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,264
- Steven?
- Uh-huh?

588
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,702
Why did you go?

589
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,845
I just couldn't stay here anymore.

590
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:54,510
- Why?
- Lots of reasons.

591
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,978
- Was I one of them?
- Not at all.

592
00:40:58,088 --> 00:41:01,353
There were things happening here
that I couldn't tell you about.

593
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:05,328
It all got to be too much.
I had to leave.

594
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:07,727
- And Nico?
- Same.

595
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:10,961
But he never stopped thinking about you.

596
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:14,903
- Neither did l.
- I missed you both so much.

597
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,803
I'm sorry, Emma.

598
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:23,403
Where'd you go?

599
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,449
Everywhere.

600
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:27,279
I've done nothing.

601
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:30,611
There's a whole world out there, Emma.

602
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:34,585
A whole world of experiences.

603
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:40,357
You just have to...
reach out and touch them.

604
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:48,035
Well, you went to all those places,
but you never bought me anything.

605
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:50,403
- But I did.
- Really?

606
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:54,777
The box. I got that for you.

607
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,369
Seriously?

608
00:41:57,781 --> 00:42:00,909
I love that thing. It's so cool.

609
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:05,081
When I touch it, l... I feel...

610
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,450
I know.

611
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:10,085
Is it a puzzle?

612
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:13,957
It's more like the answer.

613
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,090
I don't understand.

614
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:18,366
You will.

615
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:28,774
I can't drink any more of this.

616
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:32,181
Wanna finish it?

617
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,048
Sure.

618
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:46,392
What?

619
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:49,022
- You've got...
- Oh.

620
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:52,993
Let me get it.

621
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,609
You've grown up so much.

622
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:16,393
You're so... beautiful.

623
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:22,589
I missed you so much.

624
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:24,293
I missed you too.

625
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:32,798
[Emma] Oh.

626
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:14,214
[gasping]

627
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:21,821
[woman] It's just a box.

628
00:44:21,892 --> 00:44:24,884
[Ross] Maybe. But it seems to be
important to a lot of people.

629
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:29,031
There's something that's
just not right about it.

630
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:33,596
Look, are you really sure
someone's out there?

631
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,367
Maybe Steven did all this.
The phone, the car...

632
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,237
- Why would he do that?
- I don't know.

633
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:41,141
But something's not right here.
None of this adds up.

634
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:43,406
And we're just sitting here waiting.

635
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,414
I say we get out there and take a look.
Check things out.

636
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:50,475
Peter...

637
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:56,357
Ross, what do you think?

638
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:01,253
It can't do any harm.

639
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:08,267
[sets glass down]

640
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,648
Is anybody out here?

641
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:22,049
- What the hell is going on here?
- Let's just take a look around.

642
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,817
This is fucked up.

643
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:43,667
There's no one out here.

644
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:48,339
I guess you're right.
Must've been Steven.

645
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:50,746
Sorry, man.

646
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:52,906
Let's get back inside.

647
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:56,009
I'll make a run for the highway,
see if I can flag someone down.

648
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:06,290
[rustling]

649
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:08,725
What?

650
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,238
Who's there?

651
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:20,170
Look, this is private property.
What do you want?

652
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:24,377
All right, I've had enough of this shit.
Give me the gun.

653
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:29,509
Hey, what the hell's
your problem, asshole? Huh?

654
00:46:29,586 --> 00:46:32,646
You come around fucking with people,
doing God knows what to their kids?

655
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:34,486
This is private property, jerk-off,

656
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:37,550
that means that legally I can blow
the shit out of you right now

657
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,220
and ask questions later.

658
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,760
Are you deaf, asshole?!

659
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:43,624
[cocks gun]

660
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:45,766
Who the fuck are you?

661
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,230
He's here...

662
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:53,073
...the one who escaped.

663
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:55,405
Where's my son?

664
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:58,346
They will have him again.

665
00:46:58,448 --> 00:47:01,008
It is an inevitability.

666
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:02,211
Yeah?

667
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:06,845
[gasps]

668
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:08,617
What was that?

669
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:13,263
- Ross!
- Get back inside!

670
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:16,458
- Jesus.
- [man] Well, fuck you!

671
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:20,102
Anyone else out there? Huh?

672
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,695
- Any other motherfuckers? Come on!
- Peter!

673
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:26,834
Get back inside, I said!
Close the door!

674
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:28,605
[screaming]

675
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:31,336
Peter!

676
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:33,776
Peter!

677
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:37,410
[groaning]

678
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:44,226
[woman] Somebody tell me
what's going on!

679
00:47:44,928 --> 00:47:47,590
- Shh...
- [Peter grunting]

680
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:58,033
- Jesus.
- [woman groans]

681
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:03,278
Come on. Let's get you inside.

682
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:05,212
You're gonna be OK.

683
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:07,546
- Oh, my God!
- Sarah, Sarah!

684
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:09,552
- Oh, my God.
- Get me some towels.

685
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,884
- [Sarah] What happened to him?
- [women scream]

686
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:15,817
- Oh, my God!
- Get me some towels!

687
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,656
Come on, Peter.

688
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:20,754
- Oh, God.
- Peter!

689
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:22,856
No!

690
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:25,561
- Help him, help him!
- I'm trying!

691
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:28,730
- No!
- What the hell happened to him?!

692
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:31,205
- I can't hear him.
- [woman] Oh, God!

693
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:33,766
They're... they're coming.

694
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:37,837
- They're coming.
- Oh, come on, Peter.

695
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,577
I love you!
Stay with me!

696
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:43,882
No, Peter, no! No!

697
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:46,422
No! [sobbing]

698
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:49,856
No!

699
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:55,556
Sarah, take Katie to the living room.

700
00:48:57,134 --> 00:48:59,568
- No!
- Emma, go with them.

701
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:02,138
- Go with them!
- [Katie] No!

702
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:07,503
[Katie continues screaming]

703
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:17,314
[Katie sobs]

704
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:23,553
Jesus Christ.

705
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,597
Hey, Mom.

706
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:36,772
Here, give me the gun, son.

707
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:38,265
Hm?

708
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,771
Be careful, Steven, it's loaded.

709
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:44,202
Oh.

710
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:46,277
- [grunting]
- [Emma screams]

711
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:51,912
I'm guessing you're all
a little confused right now.

712
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:56,824
- What the fuck is wrong with you?!
- Shut the fuck up, little girl!

713
00:49:56,893 --> 00:49:59,418
- The grown-ups are talking.
- Why are you doing this?

714
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:06,229
Because I hate this shithole,

715
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:07,770
nowhere town.

716
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:12,363
We both hated it. That's why we left.

717
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:16,708
We simply had to get the fuck out
of this bullshit Generica.

718
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:20,712
We wanted something else.

719
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:22,679
Anything else.

720
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:27,213
Anything besides the reality
of the same job,

721
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:28,917
fucking the same women,

722
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:32,120
eating the same fucking food
day in and day out

723
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:33,560
for the next 50 years.

724
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:36,326
It doesn't have to be that way, Steven.

725
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:44,832
You'll understand
when you have your own children.

726
00:50:44,908 --> 00:50:47,775
Children. Why?

727
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:52,407
So they can end up
as fucked up as me?

728
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:57,111
I'm miserable.
I'm depressed. I'm unfulfilled.

729
00:50:57,187 --> 00:51:01,180
So I'll bring in another life into this
world and see if that entertains me.

730
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:03,123
Good plan!

731
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:05,593
How did that work out for you?

732
00:51:05,662 --> 00:51:07,789
- [grunting in pain]
- [women gasping]

733
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:10,993
Not so good.

734
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:18,098
I don't understand.

735
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:20,575
This isn't you, Steven.

736
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:22,407
This isn't you talking.

737
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:29,580
That's the first sensible thing
I've heard you say all night.

738
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:38,492
[foreign language]

739
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:42,725
- How much?
- [foreign language]

740
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:44,391
How much?

741
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:45,225
[chuckling]

742
00:52:56,573 --> 00:52:59,167
[chuckles, coughs]

743
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:05,206
[gasping, crying]

744
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:25,362
Do it!

745
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:28,296
No.

746
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:34,167
- No, I can't.
- Don't be weak.

747
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:36,405
- Kill her!
- She has a baby, Nico!

748
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:39,004
You wanna kill her?
Do it yourself!

749
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:41,209
I'm not doing this
for you anymore, Nico!

750
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:45,316
You're pathetic.
Get out of here.

751
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:51,685
- [baby crying]
- [woman whimpering]

752
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:52,853
- [cracking]
- [woman grunts]

753
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:59,332
[baby continues crying]

754
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,253
- [cracking]
- [crying stops]

755
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,725
I can't do this anymore.

756
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:38,373
We've come so far.

757
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:41,671
The world will open up for us.

758
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:46,347
I've seen things barely imagined.

759
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:51,886
- Crossed the Rubicon.
- What's left for me here?

760
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:56,358
One more time.
Bring me a man so I can take his skin.

761
00:54:56,426 --> 00:55:00,226
And then I promise,
it will all be over. I promise!

762
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,355
No, l... No.

763
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:04,833
I can't do this.

764
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:09,364
I'm done.

765
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:14,107
You won't do it?

766
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:17,171
You won't do it for your best friend?

767
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:19,408
After everything that
we've been through.

768
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:21,006
After everything that we've done.

769
00:55:27,924 --> 00:55:30,984
I've given you the shirt off my back.

770
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:40,167
- No!
- [grunts]

771
00:55:49,279 --> 00:55:52,009
It's not the shirt off your back
that I want.

772
00:55:57,787 --> 00:55:59,880
[sobbing]

773
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:02,819
What's the matter, Mother?

774
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:11,023
Don't you recognize
your dear, precious boy?

775
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:15,768
What have you done with my son?

776
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:18,600
I haven't done anything.

777
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:22,234
Is he alive?

778
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:26,976
Oh, Steven's alive.
In a way.

779
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:31,585
But those... boyish good looks
that I now possess...

780
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:36,289
...they're all gone, I'm afraid.

781
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:41,830
[Sarah] You stole his skin?

782
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,295
[Nico] He wasn't using it.

783
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:51,735
Nico.

784
00:56:51,808 --> 00:56:53,366
Not so fast, Mother.

785
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:57,436
- Sit down and shut up!
- [gasping, crying]

786
00:57:03,486 --> 00:57:06,546
I don't know why you're spilling tears

787
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:08,818
for Father dearest, there,

788
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:13,090
when your true love
lies bleeding to death.

789
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:17,526
What are you talking about?

790
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:21,668
I'm talking about you

791
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:24,332
fucking Stevie's dad.

792
00:57:27,343 --> 00:57:28,708
I know.

793
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,573
We both know.

794
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:37,310
Hell, it was one of the reasons
we decided to fly the fucking coop.

795
00:57:37,387 --> 00:57:41,050
If this is an example of the perfect,

796
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:44,093
all-American family unit in action,

797
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,594
then count me the fuck out.

798
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:49,394
Is this true?

799
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:54,736
Oh, you're one to play high and mighty.

800
00:57:58,074 --> 00:58:01,942
Aww... Little Emma...

801
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,011
[crying]

802
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:07,276
...you know you're a naughty girl, Emma.

803
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:11,814
Making out with your own brother.

804
00:58:11,888 --> 00:58:13,150
Yeah.

805
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:18,887
Emma! Give me the box.

806
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:20,623
I don't have it!

807
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:24,089
It's here.

808
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,725
I can feel it.

809
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:28,131
Tell you what.

810
00:58:28,204 --> 00:58:31,298
I'll give you 30 seconds

811
00:58:31,374 --> 00:58:33,535
to go get it...

812
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:36,078
...or I'll shoot your mommy in the face.

813
00:58:39,315 --> 00:58:40,543
- Go!
- [shrieks]

814
00:58:45,488 --> 00:58:46,546
[sighs]

815
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:52,927
Mr. Craven?

816
00:58:55,398 --> 00:58:57,127
How about an apology?

817
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,531
For what?

818
00:58:58,635 --> 00:59:02,969
For fucking my mother
and ruining both of our families.

819
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:08,042
I'm sorry.

820
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,980
- Thank you.
- No!

821
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:15,548
Not you, you little shit.

822
00:59:15,618 --> 00:59:17,347
Sarah.

823
00:59:21,424 --> 00:59:22,482
Oh.

824
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:28,021
Sorry that you were fucking around on
her or sorry you just got caught?

825
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:31,757
You know what? I don't care.

826
00:59:31,834 --> 00:59:36,134
I'm not sorry
that I fucked your little daughter.

827
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:40,970
That I was the first one
inside little Emma.

828
00:59:42,445 --> 00:59:46,347
That mine was the first cock

829
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:49,078
she ever sucked.

830
00:59:54,057 --> 00:59:56,355
I didn't even like her that much.

831
00:59:58,161 --> 00:59:59,458
[Sarah] Nico...

832
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:02,455
...where's Steven?

833
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:05,501
Where's my son?

834
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:13,406
[Steven, weakly] Nico.

835
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:18,539
Nico, please. [whimpers]

836
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:33,758
Nico, you're home now.

837
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:36,321
Why are you doing this to us?

838
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:39,425
[sobbing] It doesn't matter anymore,
you're home.

839
01:00:39,502 --> 01:00:41,436
It's not that simple, Mother.

840
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:46,201
But why? Why are you like this?

841
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:55,681
Now... give me the box.

842
01:00:55,752 --> 01:00:58,983
- Why do you need it?
- Hand the fucking thing over!

843
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:02,989
What are you gonna do with it?

844
01:01:04,227 --> 01:01:07,060
Attempt to save what's left of my soul.

845
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:11,663
If only that spineless brother of yours

846
01:01:11,734 --> 01:01:14,726
had helped me the fuck out of this mess!

847
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:19,668
I've been on the run
from them ever since.

848
01:01:19,742 --> 01:01:22,836
An eternity of torture

849
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:25,005
isn't exactly what I have in mind.

850
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:27,174
I like to taste,

851
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,218
I like to feel,

852
01:01:29,285 --> 01:01:34,086
I love to fuck.

853
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:40,358
And I'm not exactly ready to see any one
of those avenues of pleasure

854
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:42,364
cut off to me just yet.

855
01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:46,764
I need the box to call them.

856
01:01:48,304 --> 01:01:50,204
I'm thinking I can swing a trade.

857
01:01:52,975 --> 01:01:55,842
You mean all of us for you?

858
01:01:59,816 --> 01:02:01,545
Oh, no. No.

859
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:04,844
Just you, sweetie.

860
01:02:05,988 --> 01:02:07,387
Yeah.

861
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:09,787
Fresh...

862
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,160
...innocent.

863
01:02:13,696 --> 01:02:16,597
They're going to love you.

864
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:21,664
- [grunts]
- [screams]

865
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:24,366
Not so fucking innocent, am l?!

866
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:27,534
[screams]

867
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:35,974
Now open the fucking box!

868
01:03:06,149 --> 01:03:08,140
- [rattling]
- [woman whimpers]

869
01:03:14,557 --> 01:03:16,548
[rumbling]

870
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:22,991
Here we go.

871
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:25,056
[whimpering]

872
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:36,505
[Emma] Oh, my God!

873
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:58,492
[Emma] No.

874
01:03:58,601 --> 01:04:03,061
[Pinhead] You have a darkness
that rivals my own, Nico.

875
01:04:03,105 --> 01:04:08,805
It will be a very special pleasure
to rip you apart.

876
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:17,809
Hang on, hang on.

877
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,148
She opened the box, the girl!

878
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:29,096
Steven? Steven, is that you?

879
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:33,128
Steven?

880
01:04:34,403 --> 01:04:37,372
Human names, human memories,

881
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:41,467
they have no place, nor meaning,
in our existence.

882
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:46,571
- [screaming]
- Leave her alone!

883
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:50,448
Unless you want to taste her blood,

884
01:04:50,987 --> 01:04:53,785
feel her freshly razored flesh
against you,

885
01:04:53,856 --> 01:04:55,983
you'll sit in silence.

886
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:58,925
We have no desire for you.

887
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:05,723
He made her open the box.

888
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:10,870
[screaming]

889
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:21,681
- [crying]
- [sobbing]

890
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:43,168
Now, you will come with us.

891
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:47,039
No. No, no! I... I called you here.

892
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:49,077
I called you to trade her for me.

893
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:53,171
Trade?

894
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:55,539
No.

895
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:01,714
Shit.

896
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:06,757
Oh, God!

897
01:06:06,829 --> 01:06:09,696
Oh, my God!
[screaming]

898
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,863
Oh, God!

899
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:16,900
No! No!

900
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:20,932
This trinket of sensation you feel now
will be a delight

901
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:26,209
compared to the onslaught of agony
that awaits at our hands.

902
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:30,410
These banal beings have nothing.

903
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:33,488
Desire has abandoned them all.

904
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:40,024
Except for her. The dark seed that grew
within you now germinates within her.

905
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:47,765
The time will come when her
own twisted desires will ripen.

906
01:06:49,372 --> 01:06:51,738
Then she will call to us on her own.

907
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:55,669
[gasps, sobs]

908
01:06:57,079 --> 01:06:58,706
[Pinhead] Bring him.

909
01:07:10,393 --> 01:07:13,487
No one gets to kill you but me,
you little fuck.

910
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,697
Thank you.

911
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:24,672
Fool.

912
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:27,834
We had all we desired.

913
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:30,344
Our appetite was sated.

914
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:32,938
And the eternity of suffering

915
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:35,381
he would've experienced at our hands,

916
01:07:35,451 --> 01:07:39,217
would've been more vengeance for you
then you can possibly imagine.

917
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:42,746
But your actions have denied us.

918
01:07:43,292 --> 01:07:46,625
Denied us that exquisite joy.

919
01:07:46,695 --> 01:07:49,289
Now there is a deficit of flesh.

920
01:07:51,033 --> 01:07:52,933
Debt is outstanding.

921
01:07:53,969 --> 01:07:56,130
And we seek payment.

922
01:07:57,306 --> 01:08:00,002
No. No, please take me.

923
01:08:00,109 --> 01:08:01,599
No.

924
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:06,345
What few moments you have remaining

925
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:08,383
will be spent in the agony...

926
01:08:08,451 --> 01:08:10,851
- Please.
- ...that the indulgence

927
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,445
of your own foolish vanity

928
01:08:13,522 --> 01:08:15,786
has cursed your wife

929
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:19,988
to unparalleled terrors
at the hands of others.

930
01:08:21,664 --> 01:08:23,427
[screaming]
[Ross] No, Sarah! Not my wife!

931
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,224
No!

932
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:29,101
No! No!

933
01:08:30,172 --> 01:08:31,969
[crying]

934
01:08:37,146 --> 01:08:40,604
Even that which is born of the flesh...

935
01:08:40,683 --> 01:08:43,811
...is still just flesh.

936
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:46,480
Then no flesh shall be spared.

937
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:51,857
[screaming]

938
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:57,190
- [groans]
- [continues sobbing]

939
01:09:01,003 --> 01:09:02,800
I'm so sorry.

940
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:09,003
When this existence
ceases to fulfill,

941
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:13,009
we will be waiting.

942
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:25,117
I love you.

943
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:31,130
[sobbing] I love you so much!
