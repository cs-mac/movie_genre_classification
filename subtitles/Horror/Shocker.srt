1
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,090
Police are sure only of the following:

2
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,651
He is male and savagely powerful.

3
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:10,299
In almost all cases he has battered his way
to his victims through locked doors,

4
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,327
and he is so intelligent he has managed not
only to allude police for these 9 months,

5
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,996
but escape identification of any kind.

6
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,898
And now it has happened again.

7
00:02:19,998 --> 00:02:23,377
In the early hours of this morning,
the killer struck once more.

8
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:28,507
Again killing an entire family,
again escaping without being seen.

9
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,675
And this city’s descent into frustration

10
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:33,597
- and terror deepens.
- Jonathan?

11
00:02:33,697 --> 00:02:36,600
Schneider caught five touchdowns
against Dallas last night.

12
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,798
What are you watching this crud for?
Where's my Coke?

13
00:02:39,955 --> 00:02:43,274
I haven't had a good night's sleep
in over a month because of that creep.

14
00:02:43,374 --> 00:02:46,577
If you don't like the news, Doreen,
change the channel.

15
00:02:47,294 --> 00:02:49,822
I hope you don't play football
like you live your life.

16
00:02:49,922 --> 00:02:50,990
- Hey, Jon.
- Get a job, Carson.

17
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,253
Go. Hut!

18
00:02:57,888 --> 00:02:59,228
Go, go, go!

19
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,921
I'm very good.

20
00:03:01,058 --> 00:03:02,090
Way to go, Jonathan.

21
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:10,884
Keep looking at the girls, Romeo.

22
00:03:10,984 --> 00:03:13,595
- You're making me look good.
- It was a lucky shot, Rhino.

23
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:17,457
What the hell has happened
to your concentration, Jonathan?

24
00:03:17,658 --> 00:03:19,793
Are you staying in training, or what?

25
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:23,380
Or are you sneaking out at night?

26
00:03:23,747 --> 00:03:25,823
Training, Coach, I swear to God.

27
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:28,778
You know, you could be
one for the record books, Jonathan.

28
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:31,831
You come up the hard way,
you got great talent...

29
00:03:32,172 --> 00:03:34,157
but I don't know if you got greatness.

30
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:38,369
In order for you to be great, you gotta be
able to concentrate your will to greatness...

31
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:39,996
or when you look the other way...

32
00:03:40,096 --> 00:03:42,944
someone's gonna come up
and help cream your ass!

33
00:03:43,726 --> 00:03:47,985
Like that poor young lady sitting over there
in the stands with no shirt on.

34
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:50,381
You see? That's what I'm talking about.

35
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:52,342
It won't happen again, Coach. I promise.

36
00:03:52,442 --> 00:03:54,428
Now get the hell on back to the huddle.

37
00:03:54,528 --> 00:03:56,555
Get back to the huddle, let's move it!

38
00:03:56,655 --> 00:03:58,557
Looks like you've been
up all night screwing, boy.

39
00:03:58,657 --> 00:04:00,642
No, man. I haven't been able
to sleep, that's all.

40
00:04:00,742 --> 00:04:03,143
You get more ass than a toilet seat.
Don't lie to your man Rhino.

41
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:07,255
Just do me a favour. Shut up and fix
your laces before you kill yourself.

42
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:10,658
All right!

43
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:13,661
Go. Come on!

44
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:26,052
Sorry, Rhino.
Where there's a will there's a way.

45
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:31,350
Are you okay?

46
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:39,685
- Instant karma.
- Karma? I got hit by a karma?

47
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,643
That's more like it, Jonathan.
That's concentration.

48
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:47,461
That's using your will and your head.

49
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:52,158
Oh, you look like shit, incidentally.
Come on, get up.

50
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,485
Take it in for the rest of the day.

51
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,248
Attack from the rear. Let's go.

52
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:57,823
You okay?

53
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:58,990
No problem.

54
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,629
All right. You guys, back to the huddle.

55
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,539
You could have a mild concussion.
Do you wanna see the doctor?

56
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,025
No, I'm okay, Pac Man. I'm all right.

57
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,487
Oh, God.

58
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,090
Christ.

59
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,384
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah.

60
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,996
- Are you sure you're okay?
- I'm all right. Go ahead. Seriously.

61
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,955
Are you sure you're okay?

62
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:30,997
- Do I know you?
- Alison. Alison Clement?

63
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,240
I sit next to you in chemistry.

64
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,753
We've been going out
on and off for a year.

65
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:41,059
You once told me
you wanted me to bear your children.

66
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,216
- Did you?
- Did I what?

67
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,663
Did you bear my children?
I mean, maybe we...

68
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:50,214
We haven't had children yet.
We haven't even slept together.

69
00:05:50,432 --> 00:05:53,695
That's good.
I wanna be respected as a person first.

70
00:05:54,186 --> 00:05:55,218
That's good.

71
00:05:56,271 --> 00:05:58,183
Come on, I'll walk you home.

72
00:06:02,527 --> 00:06:05,481
- Straight to bed with you.
- Now we're talking.

73
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,334
You're crazy, you know that?

74
00:06:13,872 --> 00:06:15,035
What?

75
00:06:18,126 --> 00:06:19,632
Something...

76
00:06:30,972 --> 00:06:32,727
Jonathan, where are we?

77
00:06:33,266 --> 00:06:36,932
I was raised on this street.
My family still lives here.

78
00:06:39,105 --> 00:06:41,074
That's their house right there.

79
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:44,905
Who's working on the TV at this hour?

80
00:06:55,497 --> 00:06:57,999
Alison, I don't think you should...

81
00:07:30,572 --> 00:07:31,783
Bobby?

82
00:07:37,538 --> 00:07:40,551
No!

83
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,666
Jonathan, help us!

84
00:07:47,213 --> 00:07:48,935
You get away from her.

85
00:07:49,508 --> 00:07:51,727
What are you doing here, dipshit?

86
00:07:52,636 --> 00:07:55,164
- Do you wanna watch?
- Jonathan, do something!

87
00:07:55,264 --> 00:07:57,766
Shut up, bitch! Do you wanna watch?

88
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:01,013
Watch this.

89
00:08:01,604 --> 00:08:03,739
- Get him out of here!
- Diane!

90
00:08:03,856 --> 00:08:04,947
Come on!

91
00:08:07,317 --> 00:08:08,907
No!

92
00:08:10,153 --> 00:08:11,814
Jonathan, are you okay?

93
00:08:11,946 --> 00:08:14,475
Where am I? What happened?

94
00:08:14,575 --> 00:08:17,587
Remember, you ran into the goal post?
You whacked your head.

95
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:22,536
- What are you doing here?
- I stayed. I was worried about you.

96
00:08:23,874 --> 00:08:26,829
Are you sure you're okay?
You seem different.

97
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:29,539
Something's different.

98
00:08:37,681 --> 00:08:38,712
Hello.

99
00:08:40,016 --> 00:08:42,021
Hello, Lt. Parker. Hold on.

100
00:08:44,436 --> 00:08:46,157
It's your father.

101
00:08:51,485 --> 00:08:52,613
Don.

102
00:08:56,907 --> 00:08:59,043
Don, is the family all right?

103
00:09:03,456 --> 00:09:04,702
Jonathan?

104
00:09:07,042 --> 00:09:07,151
Okay, I'm gonna need
another ambulance here.

105
00:09:07,251 --> 00:09:08,652
Okay, I'm gonna need
another ambulance here.

106
00:09:08,752 --> 00:09:10,543
It's gonna be okay.

107
00:09:22,766 --> 00:09:25,233
You don't wanna go in there. I mean it.

108
00:09:26,311 --> 00:09:29,840
Jonathan, hold off. Don't.
Just listen to your dad.

109
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,091
Bobby?

110
00:09:31,191 --> 00:09:33,718
Hey, guys, come on, let's go.
Let's make this snappy.

111
00:09:33,818 --> 00:09:35,693
Sally and Mum?

112
00:09:37,447 --> 00:09:41,908
They're all gone. I tried to tell you,
there's nothing you can do here.

113
00:09:42,202 --> 00:09:45,156
Hey, get that reporter out of there.
Get her out.

114
00:09:54,005 --> 00:09:56,081
Come on, we got a gurney coming in.

115
00:10:00,219 --> 00:10:04,916
Donnie, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
She was the best.

116
00:10:05,016 --> 00:10:08,044
- Lt. Parker?
- I knew this was gonna happen.

117
00:10:08,144 --> 00:10:11,548
Lt. Parker, with the killer now murdering
your own family, will this intensify...

118
00:10:11,648 --> 00:10:14,424
...phantom-like devastator of families
struck again late last night.

119
00:10:14,524 --> 00:10:17,512
This time, killing the wife
and two foster children...

120
00:10:17,612 --> 00:10:20,472
of the detective
leading the search for the killer.

121
00:10:20,572 --> 00:10:23,309
Local college football star
Jonathan Parker, seen here...

122
00:10:23,409 --> 00:10:26,187
was also a foster child
raised by the couple.

123
00:10:26,287 --> 00:10:29,704
After being found beaten and near death
when he was just 7 years old.

124
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:36,049
For a while this rainy afternoon, the city
took time to mourn its latest loss...

125
00:10:36,296 --> 00:10:39,449
as the close friends of Lt. Donald
Parker and Jonathan Parker...

126
00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:42,504
gathered with them
to lay their loved ones to rest.

127
00:10:44,096 --> 00:10:48,166
As yet, Parker and his police have still
not so much as identified the killer...

128
00:10:48,266 --> 00:10:52,170
who has claimed seven families to date.
Almost 30 souls.

129
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,988
And left an entire city afraid to sleep.

130
00:10:55,232 --> 00:10:57,901
Who is this man? What motivates him?

131
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,570
And more importantly...

132
00:11:00,237 --> 00:11:02,242
Oh, God! Change the channel.

133
00:11:08,286 --> 00:11:11,039
Can't go anywhere without hearing
about the son of a bitch.

134
00:11:13,124 --> 00:11:15,129
Hi, Jonathan. What'll you have?

135
00:11:15,251 --> 00:11:18,514
- Jack Daniel's on the rocks.
- I'll have a Coke, please.

136
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:24,630
- I guess you're wondering why I called you?
- Yeah, I guess I am.

137
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,802
I dreamt of the murders, Don.
Just the way they happened.

138
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,693
Things like this happen,
people get bad dreams.

139
00:11:36,648 --> 00:11:38,591
I've had a few of my own lately.

140
00:11:38,691 --> 00:11:41,538
Don, no, I dreamt of it
the night it happened.

141
00:11:41,777 --> 00:11:43,438
Before you called me.

142
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:46,705
I saw what happened in the house.

143
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:50,447
You don't know
what happened in that house.

144
00:11:50,995 --> 00:11:52,536
You don't wanna know.

145
00:11:52,871 --> 00:11:55,091
Bobby was killed in the living room.

146
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,418
The flashlight was laying
right next to him.

147
00:11:59,044 --> 00:12:01,583
The fingers on his right hand
were broken.

148
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:06,313
These three.

149
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:11,229
Diane and Sally
got it up in Sally's room.

150
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,558
- What is this shit?
- That's how it was, isn't it?

151
00:12:16,478 --> 00:12:18,797
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

152
00:12:18,897 --> 00:12:20,440
This is so crazy.

153
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:24,910
I knew it was more than a dream, Don.
It was so real.

154
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,110
I could smell the blood.

155
00:12:30,408 --> 00:12:32,817
I know what this guy looks like.

156
00:12:33,912 --> 00:12:36,072
I even know he has a limp.

157
00:12:39,834 --> 00:12:43,666
Because I'm your father doesn't mean
I have to listen to this crap.

158
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:49,911
Don, just hold on a second.

159
00:12:50,011 --> 00:12:53,890
Hey, what the hell's with you?
Are you on drugs, or what?

160
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,483
Did you find tracks of a van
in front of the house?

161
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,481
How'd you know that?

162
00:13:04,775 --> 00:13:09,605
I saw it, Don. I saw him. I saw his van.

163
00:13:13,617 --> 00:13:15,408
I saw his name on the van.

164
00:13:16,746 --> 00:13:19,249
I bet I can take you to where he works.

165
00:13:20,207 --> 00:13:21,567
You tell me, I'll check it out.

166
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,487
No, I'm in on this. I'm there.
That way or no way.

167
00:13:24,587 --> 00:13:26,322
That's against procedure, you know it.

168
00:13:26,422 --> 00:13:30,052
Yeah. Well, fuck procedure, Don.
Do you want this guy or not?

169
00:13:52,072 --> 00:13:54,057
I didn't even know this place was here.

170
00:13:54,157 --> 00:13:57,444
- This is it.
- This is it?

171
00:13:57,577 --> 00:14:00,081
- Mike, come here.
- I can feel him.

172
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:06,590
- This is screwball beyond belief.
- It's just like the dream.

173
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,806
- You two go around back.
- Okay.

174
00:14:10,006 --> 00:14:13,293
- What's all the lights inside?
- Televisions.

175
00:14:13,844 --> 00:14:15,255
Look at them all.

176
00:14:17,054 --> 00:14:20,041
Look, if I get a chance, we'll come back
when the place is open. Okay?

177
00:14:20,141 --> 00:14:21,612
He's in there.

178
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:25,255
Break it.

179
00:14:25,355 --> 00:14:27,965
Now, wait a minute.
We don't have a warrant.

180
00:14:28,065 --> 00:14:31,636
- This is breaking and entering, you know.
- The place has already been broken into.

181
00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:34,488
We're investigating
an apparent burglary here.

182
00:14:34,655 --> 00:14:37,159
Right. You're right.

183
00:14:39,076 --> 00:14:41,461
This is all because he had a dream?

184
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:05,942
- Thought you said he was here.
- I thought he was.

185
00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:11,122
Keep dreaming, Lieutenant.

186
00:16:55,794 --> 00:16:56,921
Dan';?

187
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:07,099
- Wasn't one of your guys just here?
- How the hell should I know?

188
00:17:13,186 --> 00:17:14,277
Sarge?

189
00:17:17,149 --> 00:17:18,240
Sarge?

190
00:17:20,985 --> 00:17:22,456
He was just there.

191
00:17:23,446 --> 00:17:24,691
Jesus Christ.

192
00:17:27,908 --> 00:17:29,321
Call for backup.

193
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:32,424
Call for backup!

194
00:17:52,474 --> 00:17:54,710
Parker gonna keep us here all night,
or what?

195
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,135
Really. I could use a cold one.

196
00:18:02,901 --> 00:18:03,933
Judas.

197
00:18:04,194 --> 00:18:07,611
You scared the crap out of me, Sarge.
Did you find anything?

198
00:19:29,903 --> 00:19:32,822
- I can find him again.
- You stay out of this!

199
00:19:33,199 --> 00:19:35,488
This is my business, police business!

200
00:19:35,743 --> 00:19:37,770
And this fucker just killed
four of my men!

201
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:40,105
You think you can mess
with a guy like that?

202
00:19:40,205 --> 00:19:43,301
You get the hell home
and let me deal with this!

203
00:19:54,469 --> 00:19:55,661
Good morning, Maryville.

204
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,831
Although the sun
has finally come out today...

205
00:19:57,931 --> 00:20:01,134
it doesn't help for a city
afraid to unlock its windows.

206
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:04,420
Last night, a man thought to be
the long sought after slasher...

207
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,341
was surrounded by police, only to escape
in a burst of new killings...

208
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:11,970
that left four officers dead
and a police department in shock.

209
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:15,682
His name is Horace Pinker.
A virtual phantom until yesterday...

210
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:20,019
he was described for this police drawing
through a most unusual means.

211
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:21,603
According to the police report...

212
00:20:21,703 --> 00:20:26,276
Jonathan Parker, foster son of Maryville
Police Department's Lt. Donald Parker...

213
00:20:26,376 --> 00:20:28,236
dreamed of the killer.

214
00:20:28,336 --> 00:20:29,778
A junior at Mid Western Tech,
Jonathan...

215
00:20:29,878 --> 00:20:33,073
apparently was able to find Pinker's name
in a local phone book...

216
00:20:33,173 --> 00:20:36,410
after recalling it from a dream he had
the night of the murders.

217
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,852
Now, strange as it...

218
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:09,918
Twenty.

219
00:21:24,725 --> 00:21:26,101
Jonathan?

220
00:21:29,896 --> 00:21:32,435
Aren't you forgetting
your 9:00 practise?

221
00:21:33,816 --> 00:21:36,735
No. I'm going.

222
00:21:38,404 --> 00:21:39,686
I'm going.

223
00:21:41,491 --> 00:21:45,406
- Where the hell's my philosophy book?
- Under your jacket.

224
00:21:50,584 --> 00:21:51,860
Are you okay?

225
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,910
Yeah, I'm good.
I'm just worried about this exam.

226
00:21:56,422 --> 00:21:59,117
Your dad's gonna catch him
now that he knows who he is.

227
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:01,471
He's never seen him, Alison.

228
00:22:03,721 --> 00:22:05,477
Only I have.

229
00:22:10,644 --> 00:22:12,435
I almost forgot.

230
00:22:15,942 --> 00:22:17,603
Happy birthday.

231
00:22:20,613 --> 00:22:24,789
Jonathan, in the middle of all this
I can't believe you'd even remember.

232
00:22:30,706 --> 00:22:32,296
It's beautiful.

233
00:22:43,135 --> 00:22:45,045
Thanks for sticking around.

234
00:22:51,185 --> 00:22:52,845
You'll be late.

235
00:22:54,271 --> 00:22:58,102
- Are you okay?
- I'm happy.

236
00:22:59,525 --> 00:23:01,928
Go. I'll see you at practise.

237
00:23:02,028 --> 00:23:03,440
- Bye.
- Bye.

238
00:23:07,575 --> 00:23:10,423
Jonathan Parker, I love you so much.

239
00:23:34,393 --> 00:23:36,778
...suggest a man with shaven head.

240
00:23:38,272 --> 00:23:40,341
The storm continues
to remain in the area.

241
00:23:40,441 --> 00:23:43,219
Last night, pouring three inches of rain
in outlying districts...

242
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:45,388
accompanied by high winds.

243
00:23:45,488 --> 00:23:48,932
In local news, Maryville': college
football hero, Jonathan Parker...

244
00:23:49,032 --> 00:23:50,976
has pledged to play
in Saturday's game...

245
00:23:51,076 --> 00:23:54,189
despite his harrowing brush last night
with the Maryville Slasher...

246
00:23:54,289 --> 00:23:56,357
now known by name as Horace Pinker.

247
00:23:56,457 --> 00:24:00,027
A man who apparently, from evidence
uncovered in a hidden room in his shop...

248
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:02,738
practiced black magic
and animal sacrifice.

249
00:24:02,838 --> 00:24:07,159
Police Lt. Donald Parker described the place
as a "Hell hole filled with evil instruments...

250
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:10,142
"strange symbols,
and hundreds of mummified cats."

251
00:24:13,223 --> 00:24:15,666
He apparently struck again
early this morning...

252
00:24:15,766 --> 00:24:17,712
killing a family of live in their sleep.

253
00:24:17,812 --> 00:24:21,215
In this, the latest work of what is thought,
because of distinctive patterns...

254
00:24:21,315 --> 00:24:24,731
police refuse to make public,
to be the Family Slasher.

255
00:24:28,904 --> 00:24:32,393
Although Pinker was thought to have
escaped a police dragnet and left the city...

256
00:24:32,493 --> 00:24:35,838
recent evidence suggests
he has mysteriously doubled back...

257
00:25:05,232 --> 00:25:07,143
Please, God, keep him safe.

258
00:25:31,926 --> 00:25:34,162
All right! That's more like it. Okay.

259
00:25:34,262 --> 00:25:35,637
Take five!

260
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,948
- You guys seen Alison?
- No.

261
00:25:44,396 --> 00:25:45,867
Hey, Jonathan.

262
00:25:47,941 --> 00:25:49,104
Come here.

263
00:25:49,401 --> 00:25:52,118
- You better go home, son.
- Why's that?

264
00:25:53,613 --> 00:25:55,404
You better go home.

265
00:26:09,546 --> 00:26:11,072
Jonathan.

266
00:26:11,172 --> 00:26:12,834
Who let him in here?

267
00:26:14,342 --> 00:26:16,477
Jonathan, you don't wanna go in there.

268
00:26:18,137 --> 00:26:22,088
- Go outside and see if you can find his dad.
- Somebody go get him!

269
00:26:44,538 --> 00:26:45,880
Right this way. In there, sir.

270
00:26:49,376 --> 00:26:52,010
Come on. You don't want to see this.

271
00:26:56,258 --> 00:26:58,285
What the hell
did you let him in there for?

272
00:26:58,385 --> 00:26:59,548
For Christ's sake!

273
00:27:22,576 --> 00:27:23,952
Poor baby.

274
00:27:28,832 --> 00:27:30,706
I'll love you forever.

275
00:27:42,469 --> 00:27:45,139
...when our Lord takes us all
to be with Him.

276
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:50,180
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit.

277
00:27:50,771 --> 00:27:51,933
Amen.

278
00:27:52,605 --> 00:27:56,401
And now, may Alison Clement
rest in peace.

279
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:38,446
Do you know what to do?

280
00:28:38,609 --> 00:28:41,646
Yeah. I think you're tripping
but I know what to do.

281
00:28:41,862 --> 00:28:45,148
Good. Fasten your seat belt.

282
00:29:12,975 --> 00:29:15,480
- Don't leave me hanging.
- Son of a bitch!

283
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:17,220
No!

284
00:29:24,153 --> 00:29:25,624
No!

285
00:29:28,992 --> 00:29:31,910
- No, help us!
- Pinker!

286
00:29:32,078 --> 00:29:33,738
How you doing, Horace?

287
00:29:35,497 --> 00:29:38,346
Why don't you let her go?
Come take me on!

288
00:29:42,421 --> 00:29:44,830
You wanna play, you little piss-ant?

289
00:29:45,633 --> 00:29:47,673
For God's sake, do something!

290
00:29:51,138 --> 00:29:53,677
Do you wanna play in this game, boy?

291
00:29:54,683 --> 00:29:55,846
Rhino?

292
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:00,822
- Rhino?
- Rhino.

293
00:30:03,358 --> 00:30:04,949
You got it, asshole!

294
00:30:05,111 --> 00:30:06,273
Rhino!

295
00:30:07,612 --> 00:30:09,522
Yo, yo!

296
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:17,241
- Shit!
- I do it right?

297
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:20,881
You did it perfect, Rhino. Perfect.

298
00:30:21,626 --> 00:30:24,722
Maddalena and Wagner.

299
00:30:55,368 --> 00:30:58,465
Yeah. This looks like the place.
I think.

300
00:30:58,829 --> 00:31:01,546
You swear this ain't a put on, right?

301
00:31:07,964 --> 00:31:09,573
All right. Hold it. Don't move.

302
00:31:09,673 --> 00:31:11,086
You heard what he said.

303
00:31:14,052 --> 00:31:15,713
- Lieutenant?
- Yeah?

304
00:31:21,769 --> 00:31:23,087
Evening, Jonny.

305
00:31:23,187 --> 00:31:26,638
- What are you doing here?
- My job. What are you doing here?

306
00:31:27,941 --> 00:31:31,074
- It's coming from upstairs.
- Keep these two guys here!

307
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:33,646
- Back it up, boys.
- Let's go, move it!

308
00:31:34,281 --> 00:31:35,527
No!

309
00:31:45,709 --> 00:31:47,430
Freeze!

310
00:31:48,545 --> 00:31:51,084
You bastard. I'll blow your head off.

311
00:31:51,298 --> 00:31:54,810
Go ahead! Take your best shot!
She won't mind!

312
00:31:57,012 --> 00:32:00,144
I see you had to bring Daddy along, huh?

313
00:32:01,099 --> 00:32:04,645
Hey, you boys hungry down there?
You hungry?

314
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,187
Well, eat this!

315
00:32:09,941 --> 00:32:11,566
- Jonathan!
- Come on.

316
00:32:29,168 --> 00:32:30,199
No!

317
00:32:36,967 --> 00:32:38,723
- There he is.
- Yeah.

318
00:32:39,261 --> 00:32:41,789
All right, back down.
Cover the other building.

319
00:32:41,889 --> 00:32:42,921
All right, let's go.

320
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:53,100
Jonathan, forget it, man.

321
00:32:56,821 --> 00:32:58,232
Oh, Jesus!

322
00:33:37,152 --> 00:33:38,362
Come on!

323
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:55,319
Drop it!

324
00:33:55,419 --> 00:33:59,122
Drop it! God damn it, I mean it!
On the ground!

325
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:05,204
- Cuff him and get him out of here.
- Go ahead, man, shoot me.

326
00:34:05,304 --> 00:34:08,934
And by the way, boy,
she died real hard, you know?

327
00:34:10,227 --> 00:34:11,733
Your girlfriend?

328
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:15,471
I'll see you dead, you son of a bitch!

329
00:34:15,689 --> 00:34:18,050
You like killing, too, squirt?
It's in the blood.

330
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:21,636
- You and me, we're killers.
- You'll die, you motherfucker!

331
00:34:21,736 --> 00:34:24,656
I'll see you die! You fucker!

332
00:34:26,867 --> 00:34:29,371
You're breaking my fucking heart!

333
00:34:31,871 --> 00:34:36,048
Easy now. You want him gone,
let the State do it for you.

334
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,679
He'll fry for sure. He's history.

335
00:34:39,588 --> 00:34:42,601
I wanna be there.

336
00:34:43,675 --> 00:34:47,626
- What?
- If they give him the chair, I wanna be there.

337
00:34:48,556 --> 00:34:50,145
Don't be crazy.

338
00:34:51,933 --> 00:34:54,508
It's over. Now let it go.

339
00:34:55,311 --> 00:34:59,452
I wanna see him die, Don.
I've earned it. I wanna see him die.

340
00:35:03,445 --> 00:35:05,664
Yeah, maybe we've both earned it.

341
00:35:06,823 --> 00:35:08,614
I'll get box seats.

342
00:36:49,548 --> 00:36:51,056
Where is he?

343
00:36:52,385 --> 00:36:54,639
Choking on his last meal, I hope.

344
00:36:56,889 --> 00:37:01,084
Do you know what his last wish was?
TV set in his cell. Can you believe that?

345
00:37:01,184 --> 00:37:02,836
He must like his soaps?

346
00:37:02,936 --> 00:37:05,096
All right, my son, it's time to...

347
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:09,105
Pinker!

348
00:37:12,821 --> 00:37:15,611
You all right? Stay away from the bars!

349
00:37:15,908 --> 00:37:17,000
Get up!

350
00:37:17,493 --> 00:37:20,411
Come on, give it to me!

351
00:37:23,332 --> 00:37:25,550
You got it, baby.

352
00:37:39,514 --> 00:37:41,354
Get those cables off him.

353
00:37:44,102 --> 00:37:46,713
What the hell was that in the air?
Did you see it?

354
00:37:46,813 --> 00:37:50,395
Smoke, I guess.
Must have fried his fucking brains.

355
00:37:51,609 --> 00:37:52,737
Asshole.

356
00:37:53,863 --> 00:37:54,972
Put him down here.

357
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,447
God damn this!

358
00:37:57,491 --> 00:37:59,495
God damn this blasphemy!

359
00:38:05,332 --> 00:38:06,692
You better do mouth-to-mouth.

360
00:38:06,792 --> 00:38:08,985
My ass. You do mouth-to-mouth.
This guy's an animal.

361
00:38:09,085 --> 00:38:12,238
The Warden hears we let him zap himself,
we're gonna get our asses canned.

362
00:38:12,338 --> 00:38:14,308
- No way.
- Shit!

363
00:38:31,858 --> 00:38:34,242
Open up!

364
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:42,039
Finger-licking good.

365
00:38:44,161 --> 00:38:45,632
Fucking animal!

366
00:38:52,252 --> 00:38:53,794
Shut the fuck up!

367
00:38:54,128 --> 00:38:56,704
Get those men down to the infirmary!

368
00:38:58,383 --> 00:39:00,045
Is the fucker alive?

369
00:39:02,887 --> 00:39:04,395
I don't know.

370
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:10,903
Well, I'm fine, boys. Just fine.

371
00:39:12,314 --> 00:39:14,319
Let's get on with the killing.

372
00:39:18,111 --> 00:39:19,832
Okay, pretty boy.

373
00:39:21,489 --> 00:39:24,242
You come to look death in the face,
school boy?

374
00:39:25,202 --> 00:39:26,412
Strap him in.

375
00:39:32,876 --> 00:39:35,130
It isn't right. It just isn't right.

376
00:39:35,462 --> 00:39:37,822
They're treating him
like some kind of animal.

377
00:39:37,922 --> 00:39:40,556
Why give animals such a bad rap?

378
00:39:41,175 --> 00:39:43,202
Would you like to pray with me, my son?

379
00:39:43,302 --> 00:39:47,728
I'm no son of yours. Go pray
with your choir boys, you little pederast!

380
00:40:07,367 --> 00:40:08,436
Ladies and gentlemen.

381
00:40:08,536 --> 00:40:10,980
As warden of this facility,
I'm directed by the State...

382
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:15,067
to request that you all bear witness
to the execution of Horace Pinker...

383
00:40:15,167 --> 00:40:17,955
in accordance with the laws
of this great state.

384
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:21,516
In most cases, this is a duty
that I'd rather not be mine.

385
00:40:22,091 --> 00:40:24,879
However, today,
I feel justice is being served.

386
00:40:28,388 --> 00:40:32,718
- Does the prisoner have any final words?
- Yeah, as a matter of fact, I do.

387
00:40:35,771 --> 00:40:39,188
Your pitiful little memory's
wiped it all out, hasn't it?

388
00:40:39,942 --> 00:40:42,018
I used to beat you good, boy.

389
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:45,472
I was beating you good when
your mama tried to stop me with a gun.

390
00:40:45,572 --> 00:40:48,040
You shut your mouth, you fuck!

391
00:40:48,158 --> 00:40:51,610
The witness will sit down
and remain silent.

392
00:40:55,581 --> 00:41:00,042
- The prisoner has a right to speak.
- That's right.

393
00:41:01,421 --> 00:41:05,659
I was beating you real good when
your mama tried to stop me with that gun...

394
00:41:05,759 --> 00:41:09,021
that she brought into our happy home.

395
00:41:12,224 --> 00:41:15,640
You saw me kill her.
Don't you remember how she screamed?

396
00:41:16,811 --> 00:41:20,214
And how clever you were
grabbing that gun...

397
00:41:20,314 --> 00:41:24,574
and shooting me right through
the fucking knee, you little peckerhead!

398
00:41:26,487 --> 00:41:28,890
Such a big gun...

399
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:32,869
just blasting away at your daddy
with murder in your eyes.

400
00:41:36,372 --> 00:41:38,341
Like father like son?

401
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:48,993
What are you waiting for, dickhead?

402
00:41:49,093 --> 00:41:52,724
You wanna fry me?
Then do it, you fucking insect!

403
00:41:56,683 --> 00:41:58,273
You heard the man.

404
00:42:03,316 --> 00:42:06,696
The chair is armed.
Repeat: The chair is armed.

405
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,114
The inner chamber is now sealed.

406
00:42:28,548 --> 00:42:29,580
Get the lights!

407
00:42:35,096 --> 00:42:36,507
Oh, my God.

408
00:42:40,769 --> 00:42:42,049
Shit.

409
00:42:47,108 --> 00:42:49,683
Get in there, Doctor, and check him out.

410
00:43:17,054 --> 00:43:18,145
God damn it!

411
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:35,667
All right, everybody. Keep your seats.
The guard will show you out.

412
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:38,935
Lieutenant, the executioner's fried.

413
00:43:39,035 --> 00:43:41,394
- Get me a backup and get your ass back!
- You got it.

414
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:43,563
- Go, Pastori!
- I'm right behind you, Lieutenant.

415
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:46,131
I need backup in the chamber! Now!

416
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:48,067
The guy's had it.

417
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:51,372
- Help me. Get me to a hospital.
- All right, she's alive.

418
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,033
- Sergeant!
- Yeah?

419
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:56,243
Call the ambulance.

420
00:43:56,343 --> 00:43:58,536
I can't.
It's already gone with two of our guys.

421
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,414
Get me a car
and get this doctor to a hospital!

422
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:04,460
- Yeah, hold it down here.
- All cell blocks sealed.

423
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,169
UP here!

424
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:08,429
Come on, move it, move it!
Check that corridor.

425
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:11,007
He's not in here. He's gone!

426
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:13,740
Seal the cell block off! Hurry! Move!

427
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:17,107
He couldn't have gone far
after taking a hit like that.

428
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:22,864
Lock down all units.

429
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,864
Forget what he said, Jonathan.

430
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,912
Was it true?

431
00:44:32,669 --> 00:44:37,379
It's been in the papers you're a foster kid.
He's messing with your mind, that's all.

432
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:38,962
Forget it.

433
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:56,194
Jon, relax. He's not going anywhere.

434
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:59,647
They'll find him. Are you all right?

435
00:45:13,167 --> 00:45:14,758
Oh, Christ!

436
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:41,316
Jesus! That chair really kicks ass.

437
00:45:42,989 --> 00:45:45,623
Yo, get that car in here!

438
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,855
I've got her. I'll get her in.

439
00:45:50,955 --> 00:45:54,538
Leave me alone. I'm fine.
I just need to lie down.

440
00:45:55,751 --> 00:45:57,413
Get her in. Let's go!

441
00:46:01,299 --> 00:46:02,908
What the hell's with her?
I didn't touch her.

442
00:46:03,008 --> 00:46:04,952
What do you expect?
She just got knocked on her ass.

443
00:46:05,052 --> 00:46:06,677
Open up!

444
00:46:26,114 --> 00:46:28,225
How's she doing? Is she gonna make it?

445
00:46:28,325 --> 00:46:31,956
- Yeah. She looks good. Sleeping like a baby.
- Great.

446
00:46:34,498 --> 00:46:38,709
- What the hell are you doing?
- Just feel like a little head, sport.

447
00:46:39,836 --> 00:46:41,117
Let go of him!

448
00:47:06,487 --> 00:47:09,975
What the hell do you mean,
"Where's the doctor?" She's in there.

449
00:47:10,075 --> 00:47:12,578
You got an asbestos ass. Go take a look!

450
00:47:13,703 --> 00:47:16,147
Hey, what are you doing?

451
00:47:16,247 --> 00:47:18,157
What are you, crazy?

452
00:47:18,332 --> 00:47:21,653
Listen. How come you're so interested
in the doctor all of a sudden?

453
00:47:21,753 --> 00:47:24,656
Pinker is dead, Jon.
Go home, get drunk or something.

454
00:47:24,756 --> 00:47:27,533
- I don't think he's dead.
- What are you, crazy?

455
00:47:27,633 --> 00:47:29,618
Yeah, all right.
I know it sounds crazy...

456
00:47:29,718 --> 00:47:34,393
but when I saw that body back there,
I didn't feel anything like I used to. Nothing.

457
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,584
It wasn't him any more. He wasn't there.

458
00:47:36,684 --> 00:47:39,504
That's right! It's nothing but
a bunch of fried meat. And good riddance!

459
00:47:39,604 --> 00:47:42,881
It's just too bad he took
so many people with him, that's all!

460
00:47:42,981 --> 00:47:45,734
Lieutenant? Lieutenant, over here!

461
00:47:46,652 --> 00:47:49,535
- Come on.
- Keep on it, keep it on there!

462
00:47:52,199 --> 00:47:54,643
- He must have been thrown clear.
- Oh, thank God.

463
00:47:54,743 --> 00:47:56,228
- He's lucky.
- Is he gonna make it?

464
00:47:56,328 --> 00:47:59,606
- Yeah, I think so.
- All right, Pastori, hang in there.

465
00:47:59,706 --> 00:48:03,194
Now, we're gonna get you help.
You're gonna be all right, you hear me?

466
00:48:03,294 --> 00:48:04,570
Hang in there now.

467
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:06,488
- Watch his arm.
- Get him back first.

468
00:48:06,588 --> 00:48:08,740
Okay, get that mask on. Let's go.

469
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,917
Hey, what are you doing?
That's one of my guys.

470
00:48:11,051 --> 00:48:14,162
Watch that bump, push hard.

471
00:48:14,262 --> 00:48:16,801
You go home!
This is enough of this shit!

472
00:48:18,058 --> 00:48:22,068
You gotta trust me, I know something!
You ask him!

473
00:48:22,228 --> 00:48:25,776
You ask him. What happened
to the doctor? Go ask him!

474
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,868
You ask him!

475
00:48:31,403 --> 00:48:33,871
What the hell's with that kid, anyway?

476
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:44,130
- You've gotta stop him, Jonathan.
- My God.

477
00:49:44,601 --> 00:49:47,389
Alison, he's gone. He's dead.

478
00:49:48,521 --> 00:49:50,396
He's learning how to move.

479
00:49:51,441 --> 00:49:55,321
He's gonna be uncatchable soon.
It'll be slaughter.

480
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:58,109
Alison, he's gone. I stopped him.

481
00:49:59,281 --> 00:50:01,156
No, he's not.

482
00:50:01,283 --> 00:50:04,072
He's on the move. You've gotta stop him.

483
00:50:05,246 --> 00:50:10,051
Remember our love. Use this.

484
00:50:10,293 --> 00:50:12,987
It'll drive him out. Keep him away.

485
00:50:13,087 --> 00:50:16,101
Alison, please go back. Just go back.

486
00:50:16,466 --> 00:50:19,598
Hold me. I'm so cold, Jonathan.

487
00:50:20,302 --> 00:50:24,347
- Hold me.
- Stop, Alison. You gotta stop!

488
00:50:26,475 --> 00:50:27,888
Alison!

489
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:28,342
If you're here to see the house,
go next door to the landlord's.

490
00:52:30,054 --> 00:52:31,776
Jonathan, police.

491
00:52:34,643 --> 00:52:39,780
Jonathan, your father, Lt. Parker,
wants to see you down at the station.

492
00:52:40,315 --> 00:52:41,905
I got a car out here.

493
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:45,887
Jonathan?

494
00:52:45,987 --> 00:52:49,368
This is Jonathan. I'm not home.
Leave a message at the beep.

495
00:52:50,617 --> 00:52:52,352
Jon, this is your dad.

496
00:52:52,452 --> 00:52:53,978
Jonathan, you hear me?

497
00:52:54,078 --> 00:52:58,149
I thought I'd call and tell you,
Pastori, my cop...

498
00:52:58,249 --> 00:53:00,658
that survived the car wreck yesterday?

499
00:53:01,044 --> 00:53:03,071
Well, he's disappeared
from the hospital.

500
00:53:03,171 --> 00:53:06,240
I wondered if you knew
anything about it.

501
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:07,451
Jon?

502
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:09,661
Jon, you there?

503
00:53:09,761 --> 00:53:11,386
Open up!

504
00:53:19,687 --> 00:53:20,850
Pastori?

505
00:53:30,906 --> 00:53:33,755
If you won't open up, I will!

506
00:53:37,037 --> 00:53:38,199
Jesus!

507
00:53:49,716 --> 00:53:51,792
Hold it right there, Jonathan!

508
00:54:03,272 --> 00:54:05,507
Why don't you just calm down and...

509
00:54:05,607 --> 00:54:06,698
Jesus!

510
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:29,213
What's your problem, Pastori?

511
00:54:29,588 --> 00:54:32,258
You shut your fucking face, shithead!

512
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:35,505
Get down on the ground! Now!

513
00:54:36,179 --> 00:54:37,211
Pinker?

514
00:54:39,057 --> 00:54:43,695
- And let you shoot me like a dog?
- Then eat this, asshole!

515
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:11,927
Running out of gas, Pinker?

516
00:55:12,464 --> 00:55:14,849
You should've picked a better body,
you gimp.

517
00:55:48,834 --> 00:55:53,579
Jonathan, help me, please.

518
00:55:55,089 --> 00:55:56,122
Pastori?

519
00:55:57,550 --> 00:55:59,424
How did I get out of the hospital?

520
00:56:03,056 --> 00:56:06,069
Jesus, help me.

521
00:56:12,189 --> 00:56:13,851
Feeling yourself, Pastori?

522
00:56:18,904 --> 00:56:20,411
Hey, man, is he all right?

523
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:25,250
Yeah, he's all right.
He's a little under the weather.

524
00:56:36,171 --> 00:56:38,806
- Oh, mother.
- Come here, kid.

525
00:56:40,843 --> 00:56:42,314
I didn't do anything.

526
00:56:47,391 --> 00:56:48,601
Got you.

527
00:57:40,026 --> 00:57:41,307
Sorry, mister.

528
00:57:41,778 --> 00:57:44,305
It's all right, sweetie,
you just banged my funny bone.

529
00:57:44,405 --> 00:57:46,933
You ought to try being a little
more careful with that thing.

530
00:57:47,033 --> 00:57:49,322
I will. Sorry. Bye.

531
00:58:03,382 --> 00:58:04,415
Excuse me, sir.

532
00:58:05,426 --> 00:58:08,214
Have you seen a little girl, blonde,
on a bicycle?

533
00:58:10,222 --> 00:58:11,373
Sorry.

534
00:58:11,473 --> 00:58:14,855
No, I saw her.
She was up by that light pole up there.

535
00:58:15,268 --> 00:58:18,401
Well, thank you. Amanda!

536
00:58:21,733 --> 00:58:26,692
Help me. Please help me.

537
00:58:52,221 --> 00:58:54,631
Come on, you fucker! Move!

538
00:59:09,197 --> 00:59:10,360
Christ.

539
00:59:36,223 --> 00:59:38,762
Come here, you little... Come here!

540
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:44,142
Come here!

541
00:59:47,609 --> 00:59:49,365
Get away from my daughter!

542
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:51,103
Pinker?

543
00:59:51,279 --> 00:59:54,182
I'm gonna rip your lungs out,
you son of a bitch!

544
00:59:54,282 --> 00:59:56,787
Get away from her!

545
01:00:00,372 --> 01:00:02,163
What the hell are you doing?

546
01:00:05,710 --> 01:00:06,872
Amanda!

547
01:00:09,089 --> 01:00:10,335
Amanda!

548
01:00:12,092 --> 01:00:13,563
Stop, Mandy!

549
01:00:18,931 --> 01:00:19,965
Come here.

550
01:00:22,519 --> 01:00:25,023
Get out of her, Pinker.
Get out of her, you bastard!

551
01:00:31,902 --> 01:00:34,751
Mandy.

552
01:00:43,163 --> 01:00:46,830
God.

553
01:01:06,102 --> 01:01:07,894
Is this creep bugging you, ma'am?

554
01:01:10,482 --> 01:01:11,610
No!

555
01:01:26,749 --> 01:01:30,889
- No!
- Eat your heart out, sucker.

556
01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:44,720
How do you like this body, Jonathan?

557
01:01:59,322 --> 01:02:00,699
I don't get it.

558
01:02:00,866 --> 01:02:02,851
Are you saying
that Pinker is alive somehow?

559
01:02:02,951 --> 01:02:06,312
And he just jumps in and out of people
like a goddamn crab or something?

560
01:02:06,412 --> 01:02:09,757
I know it sounds crazy,
but that's exactly what he's doing.

561
01:02:09,873 --> 01:02:13,779
Maybe he's using electricity or something
because of the way he died, I don't know.

562
01:02:13,879 --> 01:02:17,959
All I do know is that
I saw him do it five times today.

563
01:02:18,174 --> 01:02:21,786
- Let's go just grab the fucker then.
- And break his neck.

564
01:02:21,886 --> 01:02:25,123
- I'd love to break his neck.
- You can't do it that directly, Rhino...

565
01:02:25,223 --> 01:02:28,604
or you'd be killing whoever it is
that he's inside of, that's the whole point.

566
01:02:28,726 --> 01:02:31,420
Then, why don't you just do
like you said you did with this cop?

567
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,797
I mean, you can outrun anybody
Pinker gets into...

568
01:02:33,897 --> 01:02:37,066
and then, when they're out of energy
Pinker's just forced out.

569
01:02:37,693 --> 01:02:41,013
- Then we'll break his neck.
- It doesn't work that way, Coach.

570
01:02:41,113 --> 01:02:45,100
You don't force him out of the body until
he's used up the life of the body he's in.

571
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:48,238
We can't go killing people
just to get Pinker out, you know.

572
01:02:49,246 --> 01:02:53,197
But there is something we can use,
to get him out before he kills the body.

573
01:02:53,834 --> 01:02:56,528
Well, what is it?
I mean, I'll get you 10 of them.

574
01:02:56,628 --> 01:02:59,974
There's only one of them.
It's in the bottom of the lake.

575
01:03:00,841 --> 01:03:02,348
The bottom of the lake?

576
01:03:02,677 --> 01:03:05,704
I know pretty much where it is.
I think we can find it.

577
01:03:05,804 --> 01:03:08,651
I have a diving mask
in my closet at home.

578
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:14,108
I just need you to go and get it, Coach.
I can't go back to that house.

579
01:03:18,066 --> 01:03:20,735
All right, I'll go get your mask.

580
01:03:21,486 --> 01:03:24,653
- Meet me at the lake in half an hour.
- I'll go with you.

581
01:03:25,490 --> 01:03:28,836
I'll get you some fresh clothes
and something to eat, too.

582
01:03:31,663 --> 01:03:33,703
- You guys be careful.
- You be careful.

583
01:03:33,998 --> 01:03:35,908
I'm not letting you out of my sight.

584
01:03:59,356 --> 01:04:00,827
Where the hell is he?

585
01:04:08,282 --> 01:04:11,768
Coach isn't coming. He's out laughing it up
with Pac Man somewhere right now.

586
01:04:11,868 --> 01:04:13,895
No way Coach'd jerk you around.

587
01:04:13,995 --> 01:04:17,358
He's an hour and 15 minutes late, Rhino,
an hour and 15.

588
01:04:17,458 --> 01:04:19,119
Does that sound like Cooper to you?

589
01:04:19,251 --> 01:04:21,903
I mean, for all I know
the cops are all over my place.

590
01:04:22,003 --> 01:04:25,385
God knows, enough people saw me
running from Pastori.

591
01:04:26,424 --> 01:04:29,495
Pinker's gonna start killing
again tonight if I don't stop him.

592
01:04:29,595 --> 01:04:32,164
I can feel it.
I gotta get that thing, Rhino.

593
01:04:32,264 --> 01:04:35,217
- I just gotta get it.
- Jon, wait.

594
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:39,266
Man, what are you doing?
Jon, wait, hold it. Okay.

595
01:04:40,815 --> 01:04:43,258
All right, maybe if I go look.
Tell me what it is.

596
01:04:43,358 --> 01:04:47,119
But you can't see a thing in here,
Rhino, without a mask. No one can.

597
01:04:47,445 --> 01:04:50,826
- I gotta go back to my place.
- What are you doing?

598
01:04:51,908 --> 01:04:53,534
I gotta go back to the house.

599
01:04:54,202 --> 01:04:56,187
You gotta go?
What the hell you talking about?

600
01:04:56,287 --> 01:04:58,773
- We gotta go. I'm with you on this.
- Get lost, no deal.

601
01:04:58,873 --> 01:05:01,067
Fuck you, you need a friend.
That's Rhino, that's the deal.

602
01:05:01,167 --> 01:05:02,293
What are you, God?

603
01:05:05,130 --> 01:05:07,532
You know what I could do to you
if I wanted to, right?

604
01:05:07,632 --> 01:05:12,057
But that ain't what I'm about.
What about you? What you about?

605
01:05:13,470 --> 01:05:15,380
You're not my friend on this, Rhino.

606
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:25,281
Look, I already got one person
I love killed, I'm not gonna do that again.

607
01:05:26,525 --> 01:05:28,031
I gotta do this by myself.

608
01:05:28,987 --> 01:05:31,395
You wanna be my friend, leave me be.

609
01:07:08,918 --> 01:07:10,129
Alison?

610
01:07:14,422 --> 01:07:15,455
Coach.

611
01:07:15,632 --> 01:07:18,978
Good evening, Jonathan. Alone now?

612
01:07:20,388 --> 01:07:21,514
What are you doing?

613
01:07:21,805 --> 01:07:26,385
If someone ever gets in your way, Jonathan,
you gotta run right through them.

614
01:07:26,977 --> 01:07:28,697
Understand what I'm saying?

615
01:07:31,356 --> 01:07:36,434
Remember what I told you?
I'm gonna rip your lungs out, Jonathan!

616
01:07:38,071 --> 01:07:40,147
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

617
01:08:09,728 --> 01:08:12,088
Coach, please, not you!

618
01:08:12,188 --> 01:08:14,572
Coach Cooper's bye-bye, asshole.

619
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:19,979
And the closet, don't look.
I made a mess on the floor.

620
01:08:49,308 --> 01:08:51,348
God, no more!

621
01:08:53,103 --> 01:08:58,026
Pac Man liked you too much, Jonathan.
He wouldn't let me in.

622
01:08:58,275 --> 01:09:02,429
That's a no-no. Time to die, sweetie!

623
01:09:02,529 --> 01:09:04,368
Don't even think about it, Pinker.

624
01:09:08,493 --> 01:09:12,954
Cooper, for your own sake, fight him.

625
01:09:13,624 --> 01:09:15,783
Don't let him take your soul.

626
01:09:16,918 --> 01:09:18,259
It's like you say, Coach!

627
01:09:18,711 --> 01:09:22,591
Coach, it's like you say,
I know you're in there!

628
01:09:23,382 --> 01:09:25,602
Everything is a matter of will.

629
01:09:27,929 --> 01:09:31,559
Will him out.

630
01:09:34,769 --> 01:09:39,314
Jonathan, he's too strong.
I can't will him out.

631
01:09:39,815 --> 01:09:41,026
Yes, you can.

632
01:09:44,528 --> 01:09:48,740
I can eat this wimp's will power
for breakfast, Jon-bo!

633
01:09:49,576 --> 01:09:50,702
No.

634
01:09:53,162 --> 01:09:57,232
I want to tell you, Jonathan,
to get this bastard!

635
01:09:57,332 --> 01:10:01,034
- Coach.
- No!

636
01:10:02,463 --> 01:10:05,096
No, Coach! No!

637
01:10:23,525 --> 01:10:27,156
No!

638
01:10:33,243 --> 01:10:37,982
Get out of my way, bitch. I need a body.

639
01:10:38,082 --> 01:10:40,621
Go back to hell
where you belong, Pinker.

640
01:11:19,955 --> 01:11:23,752
Jonathan. Jon.

641
01:11:29,674 --> 01:11:30,765
Jonathan.

642
01:11:32,926 --> 01:11:36,130
I have something
very important to tell you.

643
01:11:36,888 --> 01:11:39,023
Listen very carefully.

644
01:11:43,562 --> 01:11:44,903
Wait a minute.

645
01:11:47,774 --> 01:11:49,565
There's a little power.

646
01:11:55,782 --> 01:11:57,858
- Why not?
- Jonathan?

647
01:12:03,707 --> 01:12:07,658
I think I can.

648
01:12:13,466 --> 01:12:14,499
Damn!

649
01:12:20,432 --> 01:12:21,974
Contact!

650
01:12:23,018 --> 01:12:25,153
Jon, what's going on in there?

651
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:33,069
Jonathan, open up.

652
01:12:37,824 --> 01:12:38,855
Jonathan.

653
01:12:49,501 --> 01:12:51,826
It smells like
the goddamn electric chair in here.

654
01:13:01,805 --> 01:13:02,897
Don.

655
01:13:33,254 --> 01:13:34,534
- Hold it!
- Oh, jeez, you scared...

656
01:13:37,466 --> 01:13:41,167
- What the hell's going on around here?
- It's been a bad day, Don.

657
01:13:42,511 --> 01:13:43,759
You'd never believe me.

658
01:13:44,556 --> 01:13:47,250
It may interest you to know
there's an APB out on you.

659
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:50,388
Half a dozen people witnessed Pastori
chasing you in the park.

660
01:13:51,395 --> 01:13:52,772
He's dead now, too.

661
01:13:53,397 --> 01:13:56,685
Yeah, well, what the hell was Pastori
doing out of the hospital...

662
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,571
wearing his uniform?

663
01:13:59,821 --> 01:14:01,103
What have you been up to?

664
01:14:03,324 --> 01:14:07,275
I wanted Pinker dead so bad,
when I got my wish...

665
01:14:08,037 --> 01:14:09,450
it just made him stronger.

666
01:14:11,374 --> 01:14:12,785
You think I killed that cop.

667
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:15,903
You're talking crazy enough,
that's for sure.

668
01:14:16,003 --> 01:14:18,258
If you did,
you must've scared him to death.

669
01:14:18,588 --> 01:14:19,680
What do you mean?

670
01:14:20,967 --> 01:14:24,976
I mean, there wasn't a mark on him.
He was just dead.

671
01:14:38,233 --> 01:14:39,858
You're family a long time, Jonathan.

672
01:14:41,779 --> 01:14:43,320
Been through a lot of tough times.

673
01:14:44,447 --> 01:14:47,865
I saw you turn a screwed up childhood
into straight A's.

674
01:14:48,869 --> 01:14:52,132
Football scholarship.
I've been proud to be your father.

675
01:14:54,124 --> 01:14:56,663
I can't see you a killer.

676
01:14:59,796 --> 01:15:01,671
Besides, Pastori's body was just a...

677
01:15:04,050 --> 01:15:06,720
- A husk, just like...
- Just like Pinker's.

678
01:15:14,602 --> 01:15:15,944
Shit.

679
01:15:44,465 --> 01:15:46,434
Is that how you knew
about Bobby's fingers?

680
01:15:49,137 --> 01:15:50,228
I gotta take you in, kid.

681
01:15:52,306 --> 01:15:53,777
Don't do that, Don.

682
01:16:03,150 --> 01:16:05,260
Called for backup
when I heard the fighting in here.

683
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,393
What do you want?

684
01:16:07,237 --> 01:16:09,314
- Read him his rights.
- Yes, sir.

685
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:12,780
Jonathan, you're under arrest.

686
01:16:14,161 --> 01:16:15,822
"You have the right to remain silent.

687
01:16:16,955 --> 01:16:18,941
"Give up the right to remain silent...

688
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:21,401
"anything you say
can and will be used against you."

689
01:16:21,501 --> 01:16:22,533
Shit!

690
01:16:23,169 --> 01:16:25,246
What is it with the electricity
around here?

691
01:16:28,008 --> 01:16:31,519
- Put him in my car, I'll take him back myself.
- Yes, sir.

692
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:38,929
"You have the right to have
an attorney present during questioning.

693
01:16:40,312 --> 01:16:42,172
"If you so desire
and cannot afford one...

694
01:16:42,272 --> 01:16:43,923
"one will be appointed to you
without charge."

695
01:16:44,023 --> 01:16:46,063
Do you understand these rights
as I've read them to you?

696
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:49,119
Sure as shit can't tell
a book by its cover, huh, boys?

697
01:16:57,495 --> 01:17:00,248
All right, boys, wrap it up.
I got something to do here.

698
01:17:03,585 --> 01:17:05,910
- Check that car.
- Yes, sir.

699
01:17:06,129 --> 01:17:09,391
- Hey, Smitty, you got a key for this thing?
- Yeah, inside.

700
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:23,462
No. Shit!

701
01:17:23,562 --> 01:17:27,074
Move. Come on, Jon, get on your feet.
Let's move! Move, boy.

702
01:17:27,191 --> 01:17:29,267
Come on. Go! Explain later, go!

703
01:17:31,403 --> 01:17:33,123
Jesus!

704
01:17:36,659 --> 01:17:38,019
- Freeze!
- Shit!

705
01:17:38,119 --> 01:17:39,151
Get him!

706
01:17:39,328 --> 01:17:43,338
No, I'll get him! This one's mine!

707
01:18:16,406 --> 01:18:19,502
Don! Can't we just talk about this?

708
01:18:21,244 --> 01:18:22,276
Guess not.

709
01:18:32,713 --> 01:18:37,542
- Don, you gotta fight him.
- Eat shit and die, you little fuck.

710
01:18:38,469 --> 01:18:39,501
That's nice.

711
01:19:26,057 --> 01:19:27,647
Dead end, asshole.

712
01:19:43,492 --> 01:19:44,583
Motherfucker.

713
01:19:49,330 --> 01:19:52,842
Hey, kid, eat this.

714
01:20:15,314 --> 01:20:16,347
Come on.

715
01:20:25,574 --> 01:20:27,330
Where you gonna go now?

716
01:20:41,757 --> 01:20:45,536
Don, you gotta fight him.
You can't let him do this to you.

717
01:20:45,636 --> 01:20:48,455
You gotta get him out!
Don't let him do this, Donnie!

718
01:20:48,555 --> 01:20:53,300
Don't let him do this!
You gotta stop it! Stop him!

719
01:21:04,821 --> 01:21:05,983
What's going on?

720
01:21:08,199 --> 01:21:10,205
Don, are you there?

721
01:21:10,911 --> 01:21:13,663
- Talk to me.
- Oh, God.

722
01:21:14,872 --> 01:21:16,498
Jonathan, I'm so sorry.

723
01:21:18,542 --> 01:21:19,575
I'm so sorry.

724
01:21:38,396 --> 01:21:39,985
My heart. I...

725
01:21:52,034 --> 01:21:53,576
Jonathan, help me!

726
01:22:04,338 --> 01:22:09,048
All right, asshole, I'm nationwide now.

727
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:38,126
Donnie, give me your hand.

728
01:22:38,246 --> 01:22:39,907
Donnie, give me your hand!

729
01:22:48,339 --> 01:22:50,973
I got you. Okay.

730
01:23:05,272 --> 01:23:07,562
Donnie, I never even knew
you had a bad heart.

731
01:23:08,734 --> 01:23:09,766
I don't.

732
01:23:13,114 --> 01:23:17,623
I knew that. You knew that...

733
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:21,116
but Pinker didn't.

734
01:23:27,545 --> 01:23:30,697
With the arrest of Jonathan Parker
who was increasingly implicated...

735
01:23:30,797 --> 01:23:34,159
in the copy-cat murders following
the electrocution of Horace Pinker...

736
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:35,849
the horrors seemed to be over.

737
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:38,914
But last night, while Jonathan Parker
was in the city jail...

738
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:41,249
the copy-cat murderer struck again...

739
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:44,586
killing an entire Maryville family
and leaving a grizzly threat...

740
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:49,231
to Jonathan Parker scrawled on the wall,
signing the name Horace Pinker.

741
01:23:49,609 --> 01:23:53,274
Police are further baffled
because there were no signs of forced entry.

742
01:23:53,445 --> 01:23:58,249
The family apparently awake and
watching TV at the time the killer struck.

743
01:23:58,533 --> 01:24:01,488
Meanwhile, Jonathan Parker
has been released by authorities...

744
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:05,457
following the testimony of his father,
Police Lt. Donald Parker.

745
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:09,277
Indeed, police lab reports confirm
that the deaths of Coach Sydney Cooper...

746
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:12,225
and Student Assistant Coach
Roy "Pac Man" Stewart...

747
01:24:12,338 --> 01:24:14,914
now appear to be
the results of a murder-suicide.

748
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:18,876
Coach didn't do it, you guys,
neither did Pac Man.

749
01:24:19,971 --> 01:24:21,134
You still up for this?

750
01:24:28,271 --> 01:24:31,439
- We're friends, right?
- Yeah, we're friends.

751
01:24:33,818 --> 01:24:35,728
- And we're a team, right?
- Right!

752
01:24:37,321 --> 01:24:39,457
So we'll do what you ask us to do.

753
01:24:40,659 --> 01:24:44,455
Just make sure you do it exactly
at midnight. Give me enough time, okay?

754
01:24:44,954 --> 01:24:46,045
Right.

755
01:24:46,831 --> 01:24:49,120
- All right, let's go!
- All right. Come on. Let's do it.

756
01:25:08,518 --> 01:25:10,677
Come on, 17 minutes and counting.

757
01:25:11,187 --> 01:25:13,673
- This is crazy.
- Sometimes crazy is what it takes.

758
01:25:13,773 --> 01:25:17,120
Shut up and get in there. Let's go.

759
01:25:23,033 --> 01:25:24,065
Come on.

760
01:25:35,337 --> 01:25:36,446
- You all set?
- Yeah.

761
01:25:36,546 --> 01:25:37,638
Let's go.

762
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:47,253
The stuff's all set up and ready,
just like you asked for.

763
01:25:51,936 --> 01:25:53,562
Okay, let me get this straight.

764
01:25:54,064 --> 01:25:56,883
You want me to go on the air live
at five minutes to midnight...

765
01:25:56,983 --> 01:25:59,760
and if I do, you guarantee
you'll deliver the guy...

766
01:25:59,860 --> 01:26:02,150
responsible for the copy-cat killings
last night?

767
01:26:02,529 --> 01:26:03,562
That's right.

768
01:26:07,202 --> 01:26:11,745
- Don't make a fool out of me, live.
- I'm gonna make you a network anchorman.

769
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:14,630
You're ready for that, aren't you?

770
01:26:18,463 --> 01:26:19,590
Where're you going?

771
01:26:20,214 --> 01:26:22,659
I'm gonna go get the killer for you,
bring him right here.

772
01:26:22,759 --> 01:26:25,285
All you have to do is make sure
this camera's on...

773
01:26:25,385 --> 01:26:27,454
feeding the station by five to midnight.

774
01:26:27,554 --> 01:26:30,058
No way I'm doing what you tell me,
with you not here.

775
01:26:30,766 --> 01:26:31,798
Really?

776
01:26:31,934 --> 01:26:35,636
Well, we'll just let the other networks
get the story first, I don't care.

777
01:26:39,942 --> 01:26:42,102
- Do you want us to pack back up?
- No, leave it.

778
01:26:44,947 --> 01:26:46,857
I have a feeling this kid's for real.

779
01:26:50,118 --> 01:26:51,874
I wish Pac Man were here for this.

780
01:26:54,498 --> 01:26:55,530
A maze.

781
01:26:59,044 --> 01:27:00,206
There it is.

782
01:27:04,215 --> 01:27:06,006
The central unit should be in there.

783
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:13,943
- Too bad it's locked. Let's get out of here.
- Pick it.

784
01:27:14,350 --> 01:27:16,569
- That's a felony.
- No, that's a lock, pick it.

785
01:27:24,985 --> 01:27:26,232
Come on.

786
01:29:04,292 --> 01:29:09,120
Please!

787
01:29:10,632 --> 01:29:11,758
Jonathan.

788
01:29:23,478 --> 01:29:24,818
Jonathan.

789
01:29:49,836 --> 01:29:53,716
The red-crested nuthatch is one of
the largest arboreals found in the British...

790
01:30:24,871 --> 01:30:28,775
- Don't be afraid, Jonathan.
- You're not alive, Alison.

791
01:30:28,875 --> 01:30:30,121
So? I'm here.

792
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:05,405
All right.

793
01:31:10,499 --> 01:31:11,661
That's it.

794
01:31:14,170 --> 01:31:16,305
- Give me the crowbar.
- Crowbar.

795
01:31:16,797 --> 01:31:18,767
- Mask.
- Mask.

796
01:31:21,843 --> 01:31:24,560
All right, move it. Get back.

797
01:31:43,114 --> 01:31:44,147
Jonathan.

798
01:31:46,910 --> 01:31:50,326
Jonathan, stop sleeping.

799
01:31:51,165 --> 01:31:53,952
- Please.
- Wake up, Jonathan.

800
01:31:55,126 --> 01:31:58,673
- Don't let him catch you sleeping.
- Watch your ass, boy.

801
01:31:59,589 --> 01:32:00,965
Don't get caught napping.

802
01:32:01,632 --> 01:32:04,828
I don't wanna go through with this.
Why should I go back?

803
01:32:04,928 --> 01:32:07,253
Why should I be away from you
in that madness?

804
01:32:07,764 --> 01:32:09,769
You've got to, Jonathan, or you'll die.

805
01:32:10,266 --> 01:32:13,611
Then I die. I don't ever wanna
be away from you again.

806
01:32:14,645 --> 01:32:17,659
You'll never be apart
from me again, ever.

807
01:32:21,860 --> 01:32:25,490
$5,000, praise the Lord, for a total...

808
01:32:25,655 --> 01:32:30,794
a grand total of $1,542,000.79...

809
01:32:31,621 --> 01:32:34,857
But glory be, we hear you, Lord.

810
01:32:34,957 --> 01:32:38,966
The Lord wants more.
We still need more cash for Christ.

811
01:32:39,419 --> 01:32:42,115
Let it rain,
let it rain dollars for Christ.

812
01:32:42,215 --> 01:32:45,251
More.

813
01:32:45,467 --> 01:32:49,477
And the beast shall rise out of the pit
and walk among the world...

814
01:32:49,888 --> 01:32:53,685
and great will be the devastation
and desolation.

815
01:32:54,226 --> 01:32:58,366
And I tell you woe to the man
who is without the Lord.

816
01:32:58,814 --> 01:33:01,317
And woe to the man
and woe to the woman...

817
01:33:01,691 --> 01:33:04,953
who has not given generously
to this ministry.

818
01:33:05,362 --> 01:33:08,648
Who has not dug deep and sent cash...

819
01:33:08,990 --> 01:33:13,728
or check to this anti-beast brigade...

820
01:33:13,828 --> 01:33:17,874
of true believers
who are girding now for battle.

821
01:33:18,083 --> 01:33:21,998
I beg you, send your dollars
to Jesus now!

822
01:33:24,714 --> 01:33:28,059
Beware! Beware of the beast!

823
01:33:28,509 --> 01:33:31,144
He's among you! Prepare!

824
01:33:31,388 --> 01:33:35,564
Check your perimeter!

825
01:33:55,870 --> 01:33:56,902
Die!

826
01:34:13,095 --> 01:34:16,013
This Barcalounger's gonna
kick your ass, boy.

827
01:34:29,902 --> 01:34:32,537
It's hard to outrun
Reddy Kilowatt, asshole.

828
01:34:45,419 --> 01:34:49,823
In the last 80 years alone, over 125 million
people have been killed...

829
01:34:49,923 --> 01:34:52,200
in warfare between civilized nations.

830
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:55,645
This total is the equivalent
of murdering the entire population...

831
01:35:06,981 --> 01:35:10,113
Come on, boy,
let's take a ride in my Voltswagen.

832
01:35:43,933 --> 01:35:47,565
Alison, if you're in me,
give me the power to do this.

833
01:36:05,037 --> 01:36:06,070
Bastard!

834
01:36:10,334 --> 01:36:11,676
Who the hell's that guy?

835
01:36:12,337 --> 01:36:13,962
Take cover!

836
01:36:14,547 --> 01:36:17,015
Do as your father asks.
Roll up the window.

837
01:36:18,050 --> 01:36:21,162
Hey, Beaver!

838
01:36:21,262 --> 01:36:23,517
Well, it's all out in the open now.

839
01:36:35,233 --> 01:36:38,581
So we still have no word
from our reporter at the home of Lt. Parker.

840
01:36:38,696 --> 01:36:42,391
However, incredibly, we have begun
to receive unconfirmed reports...

841
01:36:42,491 --> 01:36:45,811
of unexplained appearances
of Jonathan Parker...

842
01:36:45,911 --> 01:36:49,791
and a man who looks very much like
executed mass murderer Horace Pinker...

843
01:36:50,166 --> 01:36:53,695
- fighting at least what appears to be...
- Kick his ass!

844
01:36:53,795 --> 01:36:57,306
...the programming of several local stations
during the last several minutes.

845
01:37:01,302 --> 01:37:02,464
And that's the way it is.

846
01:37:04,971 --> 01:37:06,064
Did you get that?

847
01:37:10,769 --> 01:37:13,308
My kind of town!

848
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:14,513
Move it out.

849
01:37:23,281 --> 01:37:26,069
- Come here, you shit!
- Dial 911!

850
01:37:59,150 --> 01:38:00,739
We got any cheese spread?

851
01:38:03,029 --> 01:38:04,998
Now wait a minute, that's my drink.

852
01:38:07,199 --> 01:38:10,019
- Honey.
- Do we have any cheese spread, or what?

853
01:38:10,119 --> 01:38:12,396
Come on!

854
01:38:12,496 --> 01:38:13,837
Get him, honey.

855
01:38:19,087 --> 01:38:20,557
Now watch out.

856
01:38:22,548 --> 01:38:23,579
Now wait a minute.

857
01:38:25,050 --> 01:38:28,752
I've heard of audience participation shows,
but this is ridiculous.

858
01:38:29,013 --> 01:38:30,080
Give me that!

859
01:38:30,180 --> 01:38:31,213
You can't take that.

860
01:38:32,474 --> 01:38:34,479
He's taking our remote.

861
01:38:38,021 --> 01:38:39,054
Sweet Jesus!

862
01:38:45,612 --> 01:38:46,645
Shut up!

863
01:38:48,782 --> 01:38:49,808
Come here.

864
01:38:49,908 --> 01:38:51,913
Brother, are you all right?

865
01:38:56,122 --> 01:38:57,155
Get up, you shit!

866
01:39:12,097 --> 01:39:14,765
Holy shit! It's him! Horace Pinker.

867
01:39:22,231 --> 01:39:24,450
What are you staring at?
Get the camera on him!

868
01:39:30,114 --> 01:39:33,247
A special bulletin?
I'll give you a show!

869
01:39:34,577 --> 01:39:35,669
Let's get out of here!

870
01:39:46,339 --> 01:39:49,091
I killed your mama
and your little sister here.

871
01:39:49,967 --> 01:39:53,799
Right about there.
I'll do you here, too.

872
01:39:57,558 --> 01:39:59,527
Say your prayers, squirt.

873
01:40:00,227 --> 01:40:02,980
I'm gonna do you real slow.

874
01:40:15,992 --> 01:40:19,030
Hey, what the fuck?

875
01:40:27,004 --> 01:40:28,035
It's show time.

876
01:40:35,095 --> 01:40:37,314
What the hell are you doing?

877
01:40:37,681 --> 01:40:42,224
You bought into TV, Pinker,
now you're bound by its rules.

878
01:40:44,312 --> 01:40:47,444
I'm gonna show you something.
Remember Bobby, my little brother?

879
01:40:50,609 --> 01:40:54,240
My mother? My baby sister?

880
01:40:58,827 --> 01:41:01,780
Let's try and remember
all the other families, Horace.

881
01:41:01,912 --> 01:41:06,990
Fathers, mothers,
sleeping defenceless in their beds.

882
01:41:08,670 --> 01:41:13,000
Try. Try to remember the pain. No?

883
01:41:13,924 --> 01:41:17,507
Then get up on the bed. Up!

884
01:41:17,678 --> 01:41:21,131
- God damn you little bastard... Stop it!
- Just freeze.

885
01:41:22,392 --> 01:41:25,179
- That's good.
- And what the fuck?

886
01:41:27,562 --> 01:41:29,852
I just showed you
what you can never remember.

887
01:41:30,232 --> 01:41:32,635
What it feels like to victimized.

888
01:41:32,735 --> 01:41:35,309
Give me a violin, why don't you?

889
01:41:36,113 --> 01:41:39,494
At the mercy of some guy's hate. Weapon?

890
01:41:41,159 --> 01:41:45,455
- Doesn't feel so good, does it?
- Go ahead, do it.

891
01:41:46,373 --> 01:41:49,042
You know you wanna do it.
Go ahead, you little pussy, do it.

892
01:41:54,005 --> 01:41:57,518
- It's not my style.
- It is your style.

893
01:41:57,843 --> 01:42:00,762
You're a chip off the old block,
like it or not.

894
01:42:00,887 --> 01:42:02,872
No good, Pinker,
Alison told me the secret.

895
01:42:02,972 --> 01:42:05,689
Maybe you were my father,
but you know who my father is now?

896
01:42:06,184 --> 01:42:09,295
Know who's responsible for me?
Me, no one else.

897
01:42:09,395 --> 01:42:12,148
I get down from here
and you're dog meat.

898
01:42:12,315 --> 01:42:16,574
Three minutes to midnight, Pinker.
Rhino blows the Maryville Power Station...

899
01:42:16,861 --> 01:42:17,970
we'll see who's dog meat.

900
01:42:18,070 --> 01:42:20,848
Town power goes, TV goes...

901
01:42:20,948 --> 01:42:23,962
and anybody in this TV room's
gonna go right with it.

902
01:42:24,619 --> 01:42:28,166
Anybody who gets out first
might just survive.

903
01:42:28,872 --> 01:42:31,506
Wait a minute,
it was three minutes before.

904
01:42:31,792 --> 01:42:36,622
Your watch has taken a licking.
And I don't think it's ticking no more.

905
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:41,660
Rhino, no!

906
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:42,793
One, two...

907
01:42:54,314 --> 01:42:56,853
You should've killed me
when you had the chance, prick.

908
01:43:06,868 --> 01:43:09,621
Shit. It's working!

909
01:43:22,967 --> 01:43:24,000
Shit!

910
01:43:39,818 --> 01:43:42,701
- It's sign off time.
- No!

911
01:44:07,303 --> 01:44:09,972
No!

912
01:44:35,330 --> 01:44:39,590
You bastard, come back in here.
Come back in here, you shit!

913
01:44:39,793 --> 01:44:44,183
Don't ever turn the TV on, boy,
I'll be there. I'll be there waiting for you.

914
01:44:44,298 --> 01:44:46,826
I'll look over your shoulder,
you little bastard.

915
01:44:46,926 --> 01:44:52,135
Come back in here! Come back!

916
01:45:00,646 --> 01:45:02,902
Bob, you got any lights in your place?

917
01:45:03,233 --> 01:45:04,953
Looks like the power's out all over.

918
01:45:05,903 --> 01:45:07,907
- Beautiful.
- Look at that sky.

919
01:45:08,404 --> 01:45:10,279
- Look at that.
- Isn't it beautiful?

920
01:45:12,617 --> 01:45:14,338
Jon, I just saw you on the tube.

921
01:45:14,744 --> 01:45:17,758
- Was that real?
- Yeah, it was real enough.

922
01:45:20,750 --> 01:45:21,817
Howard?

923
01:45:21,917 --> 01:45:23,792
Wow, what a storm that was.

924
01:45:25,129 --> 01:45:26,600
And look at that sky.

925
01:45:30,718 --> 01:45:32,557
Are you there, you see those stars?

926
01:45:33,012 --> 01:45:36,428
- Absolutely beautiful.
- It sure is.
