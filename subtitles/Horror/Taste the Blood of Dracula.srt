2
00:00:50,362 --> 00:00:53,456
What a way to travel, eh? Barbaric.

3
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,400
Horseless carriage, thas the way.

4
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:01,428
I've seen them myself, you know.
Paris, London.

5
00:01:02,441 --> 00:01:05,968
London. Thas where my business is,
buying and selling.

6
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:11,075
The fact is, I got these
on my last stop here. Karlsburg.

7
00:01:13,452 --> 00:01:15,079
Pretty, isn't it?

8
00:01:16,755 --> 00:01:19,656
Six crowns it cost in Karlsburg.

9
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:22,959
I can let you have one for three.

10
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,626
Two crowns, then. I can't go any lower.

11
00:01:30,936 --> 00:01:32,198
Oh, well.

12
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:34,165
Give.

13
00:01:36,908 --> 00:01:38,671
- Sorry.
- Give me.

14
00:01:39,277 --> 00:01:41,268
I should do as he says.

15
00:01:43,949 --> 00:01:45,246
One crown, then?

16
00:01:45,651 --> 00:01:46,675
No!

17
00:03:17,809 --> 00:03:18,798
God.

18
00:03:20,378 --> 00:03:22,346
Oh, my God.

19
00:05:32,577 --> 00:05:34,169
Dracula's blood.

20
00:06:11,082 --> 00:06:13,482
Where is that girl? Alice!

21
00:06:14,352 --> 00:06:17,150
- Yes, Father.
- All right, dear?

22
00:06:25,997 --> 00:06:28,227
Is a brisk morning, Father.

23
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,857
Indeed, Jeremy.

24
00:06:32,938 --> 00:06:36,374
Isn't Alice's hat pretty, Mother?
Is a pretty color, don't you think?

25
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:37,965
Come along now.

26
00:06:39,811 --> 00:06:41,642
- Mr. Hargood.
- Thank you, Vicar.

27
00:06:41,713 --> 00:06:45,274
- This was a very nice sermon.
- Did you think so? I hadn't planned it.

28
00:06:48,053 --> 00:06:50,112
Mr. Secker, good day.

29
00:06:51,489 --> 00:06:53,787
- Excellent service.
- Mr. Paxton.

30
00:06:57,996 --> 00:06:59,588
- Hello.
- Hello.

31
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,930
- The Allens are having a party on Friday.
- I know, and I haven't been invited.

32
00:07:05,003 --> 00:07:06,368
You will be.

33
00:07:13,244 --> 00:07:14,677
When shall I see you?

34
00:07:19,784 --> 00:07:21,251
I don't know.

35
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:19,000
You will stay here, Alice.

36
00:08:21,246 --> 00:08:24,682
You will apologize to your mother and I
for your behavior.

37
00:08:24,749 --> 00:08:27,912
- Thank you. You may go.
- For what behavior?

38
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,353
You will apologize,
then go up to your room and stay there.

39
00:08:31,423 --> 00:08:33,584
- Do you understand?
- No, I don't understand...

40
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:36,126
You know perfectly well
what I'm talking about.

41
00:08:36,227 --> 00:08:37,819
Mother, I don't understand...

42
00:08:37,896 --> 00:08:41,093
You were smiling and flirting
with that young man.

43
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:43,196
But that was Paul, Father.

44
00:08:43,268 --> 00:08:46,567
I don't care. He is still a young man
and you are a young woman.

45
00:08:46,704 --> 00:08:48,934
A sexually mature young woman.

46
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,803
I will not have you displaying yourself
in that provocative manner.

47
00:08:53,978 --> 00:08:56,139
Is because it was Paul, isn't it?

48
00:08:56,214 --> 00:08:59,274
You've never liked him,
but he can't help that.

49
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:01,851
But you can help behaving like a harlot.

50
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,445
- Papa!
- A harlot in Goïs house!

51
00:09:04,622 --> 00:09:05,884
Oh, my God.

52
00:09:05,957 --> 00:09:08,391
Blasphemy will only make it worse.

53
00:09:17,268 --> 00:09:20,169
Is only natural in a young girl, William.

54
00:09:27,612 --> 00:09:30,046
Lunch will soon be ready, William.

55
00:09:31,249 --> 00:09:33,479
You may send hers up on a tray.

56
00:09:33,918 --> 00:09:35,681
And her supper, too.

57
00:09:36,554 --> 00:09:39,921
- Yes, dear.
- I shall not, of course, be in to supper.

58
00:09:41,092 --> 00:09:44,391
But I asked Cook to bake a ham
the way you like it.

59
00:09:45,797 --> 00:09:49,096
I am never in to supper
the last Sunday in the month.

60
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,292
- Surely you know that by now.
- Yes, of course.

61
00:09:53,538 --> 00:09:56,507
- Your charity work in the East End.
- Exactly.

62
00:10:09,988 --> 00:10:12,889
Don't judge your father too harshly,
my dear.

63
00:10:14,058 --> 00:10:16,049
I know just how you feel.

64
00:10:17,462 --> 00:10:19,020
Do you, Mother?

65
00:10:19,664 --> 00:10:21,894
Well, of course I do, darling.

66
00:10:24,169 --> 00:10:26,694
I was young like you once, you know.

67
00:10:27,372 --> 00:10:30,830
Young and excited by the prospect
of my life before me.

68
00:10:31,276 --> 00:10:32,834
Until you met him.

69
00:10:34,245 --> 00:10:37,908
He crushed you, didn't he?
He crushed the life right out of you.

70
00:10:37,982 --> 00:10:40,109
You mustn't say such things.

71
00:10:40,451 --> 00:10:42,783
Well, he's not going to do it to me.

72
00:10:43,254 --> 00:10:46,553
- You're upset.
- With good reason.

73
00:10:47,725 --> 00:10:50,125
Mother, why does he hate Paul so?

74
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:53,919
I've honestly no idea. No idea at all.

75
00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:58,692
- Is it something to do with Paul's father?
- Mr. Paxton?

76
00:10:59,938 --> 00:11:03,533
I don't see how it can be.
They scarcely know one another.

77
00:11:21,492 --> 00:11:23,517
Bit late tonight, Hargood.

78
00:11:23,795 --> 00:11:26,025
I am exactly on time, Paxton.

79
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,205
Exactly on time as usual, gentlemen.

80
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:17,509
I thought we were a little late, Secker.

81
00:12:25,857 --> 00:12:27,791
Hot potatoes.

82
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,662
Sir!

83
00:13:03,428 --> 00:13:06,056
- This way, gentlemen.
- We know the way.

84
00:13:11,869 --> 00:13:13,837
Well, what have we here?

85
00:13:16,808 --> 00:13:19,743
Veronica, you look delightful.
Nice to see you again.

86
00:13:19,811 --> 00:13:22,712
Such a pleasure
to see you again, gentlemen.

87
00:13:22,914 --> 00:13:25,781
Punctual to the minute, as always.

88
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,910
I have your usual room ready for you,
of course.

89
00:13:28,986 --> 00:13:31,477
I hope the entertainment
isn't too usual, Felix.

90
00:13:31,556 --> 00:13:35,890
No, I've selected something
most diverting for you gentlemen tonight.

91
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,121
I'm sure it will amuse you.

92
00:13:38,196 --> 00:13:40,289
I've been getting a bit bored with it.

93
00:13:40,365 --> 00:13:43,391
You won't be bored tonight,
I can assure you of that.

94
00:13:43,468 --> 00:13:45,561
I think is best if you leave it all to me...

95
00:13:45,636 --> 00:13:49,902
because I know the girls who are
really clean, if you get my meaning.

96
00:13:49,974 --> 00:13:53,501
Some of the girls sent to me,
they've no idea.

97
00:13:53,578 --> 00:13:56,206
Straight into a hot bath they go,
and do they scream!

98
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,578
They don't want to be seen
without their clothes on.

99
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:01,379
I told them there's no point being shy
in a place like this.

100
00:14:01,452 --> 00:14:03,352
Here we are, gentlemen.

101
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:10,586
Everything is ready, as you see.

102
00:14:10,661 --> 00:14:14,495
Here, let me take that for you. Thank you.

103
00:14:19,337 --> 00:14:23,933
Thas right. You can't be too careful,
can you? Thank you.

104
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:28,838
Here, let me.

105
00:14:30,248 --> 00:14:32,443
- Well done.
- Thank you, Felix.

106
00:14:33,217 --> 00:14:35,913
- Sir, there.
- Thank you.

107
00:14:37,255 --> 00:14:41,316
Gentlemen, may I be permitted to say,
"To your health"?

108
00:14:41,426 --> 00:14:45,522
And now, if you will excuse me,
I'll just go and...

109
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,454
Well, you know.

110
00:14:49,367 --> 00:14:51,335
- Paxton?
- Yes, all right.

111
00:14:53,604 --> 00:14:55,765
- Secker?
- I don't think so.

112
00:15:01,412 --> 00:15:03,471
- Gentlemen.
- To your health.

113
00:15:05,683 --> 00:15:07,913
Ready when you are, gentlemen.

114
00:15:28,372 --> 00:15:29,896
Oh, my goodness.

115
00:16:33,604 --> 00:16:36,869
Why don't you stop pushing your way
in here and upsetting everyone?

116
00:16:36,941 --> 00:16:38,340
You're not wanted here.

117
00:16:38,409 --> 00:16:42,004
For Goïs sake, will you please go away
and stay away?

118
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,603
Do you hear me?

119
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,910
- Oh, darling.
- Sorry.

120
00:16:49,787 --> 00:16:52,085
No, not in here. I do beg your pardon.

121
00:16:57,828 --> 00:16:58,817
No!

122
00:17:01,566 --> 00:17:03,090
You can't go...

123
00:17:05,903 --> 00:17:08,929
You are not going in there.
Don't you dare try to go in there.

124
00:17:09,006 --> 00:17:11,839
They're some of my best gentlemen
in there.

125
00:17:12,577 --> 00:17:14,067
Bravo!

126
00:17:19,283 --> 00:17:20,841
Now, look here.

127
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:24,213
- Yes?
- You can't come in here.

128
00:17:24,288 --> 00:17:25,653
But I have.

129
00:17:30,795 --> 00:17:32,353
Who's going to pay?

130
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:36,560
My girls aren't free for any Tom, Dick,
or Harry, you know.

131
00:17:44,508 --> 00:17:45,998
Good heavens.

132
00:17:47,178 --> 00:17:48,805
Impudent young puppy.

133
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:53,048
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
I can't begin to tell you.

134
00:17:53,351 --> 00:17:56,320
Yes. Well, get rid of these girls.

135
00:17:56,387 --> 00:18:00,687
No, Mr. Hargood,
I've got another lovely girl for you.

136
00:18:00,758 --> 00:18:04,285
- Get rid of them.
- Yes, of course. Come now, girls.

137
00:18:05,129 --> 00:18:07,029
Thas a girl. Thas it.

138
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:10,898
Who is he?

139
00:18:11,002 --> 00:18:13,368
An impudent rascal, thas what.

140
00:18:13,938 --> 00:18:15,496
Yes, who is he?

141
00:18:15,573 --> 00:18:19,100
He's young Courtley. Lord Courtley, sir.

142
00:18:20,344 --> 00:18:21,811
You must remember.

143
00:18:21,912 --> 00:18:24,574
His father disowned him
several years ago...

144
00:18:24,915 --> 00:18:26,883
cut him off without a shilling.

145
00:18:27,118 --> 00:18:31,145
Found him celebrating black mass
in the family chapel.

146
00:18:32,423 --> 00:18:34,391
Very nasty, it was.

147
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:39,853
- So thas young Courtley.
- Yes, terrible scandal it was.

148
00:18:40,297 --> 00:18:42,857
How does he live? Does he work?

149
00:18:42,933 --> 00:18:45,231
Him? Never a stroke.

150
00:18:45,569 --> 00:18:48,629
- Then how?
- They keep him.

151
00:18:49,874 --> 00:18:51,364
What, the girls pay him?

152
00:18:51,442 --> 00:18:55,173
Yes, they're fascinated by him.
He's the very devil himself.

153
00:18:55,613 --> 00:18:58,810
If I were religious,
I would say he was possessed.

154
00:19:01,419 --> 00:19:03,319
Possessed of the devil.

155
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,231
Young man.

156
00:19:19,036 --> 00:19:22,836
If you're serving a writ, my friend,
please don't waste my time...

157
00:19:22,907 --> 00:19:24,932
or yours, for that matter.

158
00:19:25,209 --> 00:19:26,733
Lord Courtley.

159
00:19:30,748 --> 00:19:31,976
Do I know you?

160
00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:35,852
Of course, I took your woman from you.

161
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,185
If is to be swords or pistols,
I have neither.

162
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:43,049
My friends and I
would like to take you to supper.

163
00:19:43,127 --> 00:19:45,357
- Why?
- We want to talk to you.

164
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:47,522
- About?
- Over supper.

165
00:19:49,734 --> 00:19:51,065
Very well.

166
00:19:59,677 --> 00:20:02,077
- Driver...
- The Café Royal, driver.

167
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,643
Is the only place.

168
00:20:20,998 --> 00:20:23,398
- May I come in, dear?
- Yes, Mother.

169
00:20:27,271 --> 00:20:30,035
- All ready for bed, dear?
- Just getting ready.

170
00:20:34,612 --> 00:20:38,275
- You've hardly eaten a thing, dear.
- I wasn't hungry.

171
00:20:43,387 --> 00:20:44,649
Mother.

172
00:20:46,023 --> 00:20:47,820
I'm so sorry for you.

173
00:20:48,826 --> 00:20:52,956
- Because I didn't eat my supper?
- You know it isn't that.

174
00:20:54,832 --> 00:20:56,561
I know it isn't, Mother.

175
00:20:57,501 --> 00:20:59,128
Don't worry, please.

176
00:21:06,477 --> 00:21:08,240
Good night, darling.

177
00:21:08,846 --> 00:21:10,575
Good night, Mother.

178
00:21:26,697 --> 00:21:28,995
Then let me explain it for you.

179
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,101
You and your two friends here
have formed a little society...

180
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:38,005
with the objects of enjoying
the more unusual aspects of this life.

181
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:39,899
Is that right?

182
00:21:40,444 --> 00:21:41,775
That is quite right.

183
00:21:41,846 --> 00:21:45,748
At the same time,
keeping up a fagade of respectability...

184
00:21:45,816 --> 00:21:48,808
in front of your families
and local community.

185
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,710
Is that right?

186
00:21:51,922 --> 00:21:54,117
- Well, I hardly...
- I wouldn't put it like that.

187
00:21:54,191 --> 00:21:58,685
And having tried everything that
your narrow imaginations can suggest...

188
00:21:59,029 --> 00:22:02,157
you're bored to death with it all, right?

189
00:22:03,801 --> 00:22:06,531
And now you want someone...

190
00:22:06,604 --> 00:22:10,005
with infinitely greater experience
than yourselves...

191
00:22:10,074 --> 00:22:12,907
to suggest alternatives?

192
00:22:13,277 --> 00:22:17,407
- Thas it exactly.
- Just how far are you willing to go?

193
00:22:18,649 --> 00:22:22,779
For instance, would you be willing
to sell your souls to the devil?

194
00:22:26,357 --> 00:22:28,325
What exactly do you mean?

195
00:22:28,392 --> 00:22:30,417
I mean exactly what I say:

196
00:22:30,861 --> 00:22:33,227
Sell your souls to the devil.

197
00:22:36,033 --> 00:22:38,763
- I don't know.
- Then we're wasting time.

198
00:22:38,903 --> 00:22:42,634
If one thought that one's experience
might be extended...

199
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,732
It would be extended to infinity.

200
00:22:47,678 --> 00:22:49,578
What would we have to do?

201
00:22:49,647 --> 00:22:53,413
- First you will need money.
- Yes, I thought as much.

202
00:22:53,484 --> 00:22:58,046
No, not for me. To buy something
that we shall need for the ceremony.

203
00:22:59,456 --> 00:23:02,448
- What is it we have to buy?
- And how much?

204
00:23:04,561 --> 00:23:06,153
I will show you.

205
00:23:19,643 --> 00:23:21,577
Who else did you expect?

206
00:23:21,645 --> 00:23:24,136
Don't be silly.
Wait a moment and I'll come down.

207
00:23:24,214 --> 00:23:26,239
If you don't, I'm coming up.

208
00:23:26,317 --> 00:23:27,716
Don't you dare.

209
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:48,998
- Come on, monkey.
- You'll wake them up.

210
00:24:00,484 --> 00:24:02,884
- Alice, nothing but good news.
- What?

211
00:24:02,953 --> 00:24:06,389
My uncle Harry will lend me the money.
I can go into business on my own.

212
00:24:06,457 --> 00:24:10,894
So, my darling, there's absolutely nothing
to stop us getting away.

213
00:24:12,196 --> 00:24:15,324
So when is it to be?
This week? Tomorrow?

214
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:17,527
Really.

215
00:24:19,203 --> 00:24:21,034
You don't mean that, do you?

216
00:24:21,105 --> 00:24:23,096
- Mean it?
- About tomorrow?

217
00:24:24,108 --> 00:24:25,769
Whas to stop us?

218
00:24:28,712 --> 00:24:31,112
Well, I can't just leave them.

219
00:24:32,483 --> 00:24:34,451
- Not like that.
- Why not?

220
00:24:35,285 --> 00:24:37,776
You've told me often enough
how he treats you...

221
00:24:37,855 --> 00:24:41,291
how you long to get away. He'll never
agree to let us meet any other way.

222
00:24:41,358 --> 00:24:44,452
- But my mother...
- She married him, didn't she?

223
00:24:44,528 --> 00:24:46,428
She chose to be his wife.

224
00:24:46,497 --> 00:24:48,294
She's also my mother.

225
00:24:48,365 --> 00:24:50,799
I can't just run away and leave her.

226
00:24:52,202 --> 00:24:53,362
I see.

227
00:24:55,305 --> 00:24:58,763
So it was all just talk,
about our going away.

228
00:24:59,977 --> 00:25:02,810
No, it wasn't just all talk, Paul.

229
00:25:04,048 --> 00:25:06,016
I love you, really I do.

230
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:09,346
I've said I want to marry you and I do.

231
00:25:09,653 --> 00:25:12,554
I want it more than anything in this world.

232
00:25:12,623 --> 00:25:14,921
And if it was anything else...

233
00:25:18,095 --> 00:25:21,394
If I left her, Paul, I think she'd die.

234
00:25:23,167 --> 00:25:25,260
So what are we going to do?

235
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:29,070
I don't know.

236
00:25:30,541 --> 00:25:33,840
Paul, never stop loving me. Never.

237
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,378
Where are you, Weller?

238
00:25:45,389 --> 00:25:46,856
Who wants me?

239
00:25:48,959 --> 00:25:50,483
Is you, is it?

240
00:25:50,828 --> 00:25:53,422
Come on out, you old fool.
We've business to discuss.

241
00:25:53,497 --> 00:25:55,658
What sort of business
can you have with me?

242
00:25:55,732 --> 00:25:57,597
I want to buy, Weller.

243
00:25:58,268 --> 00:26:00,498
You? Buy?

244
00:26:03,006 --> 00:26:05,372
- Buy what?
- You know what.

245
00:26:07,177 --> 00:26:08,576
Is not for sale.

246
00:26:09,813 --> 00:26:12,646
- You'll sell anything for money.
- Money? What money?

247
00:26:12,716 --> 00:26:15,276
Would you please tell us
what this is all about?

248
00:26:15,352 --> 00:26:17,820
- Quite.
- You say the price, Weller.

249
00:26:18,088 --> 00:26:20,556
- More than you can afford.
- Granted.

250
00:26:21,859 --> 00:26:24,589
But is these gentlemen who are buying.

251
00:26:24,795 --> 00:26:27,229
- Whas that?
- Buying what exactly?

252
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,665
Is it true?

253
00:26:34,204 --> 00:26:36,263
- You want to buy?
- Possibly...

254
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:39,571
if we knew what it was
we're supposed to be buying.

255
00:26:40,511 --> 00:26:42,274
- Don't you know?
- No.

256
00:26:43,981 --> 00:26:45,642
Show them, Weller.

257
00:28:00,657 --> 00:28:02,022
The master.

258
00:28:10,968 --> 00:28:12,902
Courtley, what is all this about?

259
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:16,736
- A concentration of evil, my dear sirs.
- A what?

260
00:28:16,807 --> 00:28:20,174
These pieces belong
to the most evil man of all time:

261
00:28:21,778 --> 00:28:23,268
Count Dracula.

262
00:28:28,552 --> 00:28:31,385
You'll know that I tell the truth
when I so describe him:

263
00:28:31,455 --> 00:28:33,923
His cloak, his signet ring...

264
00:28:35,092 --> 00:28:36,491
his clasp.

265
00:28:41,798 --> 00:28:43,959
- And his blood.
- His blood?

266
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:48,501
His blood.

267
00:28:49,706 --> 00:28:52,174
But is just powder.

268
00:28:54,511 --> 00:28:57,071
Thas right, gentlemen. Is only powder.

269
00:28:57,147 --> 00:28:58,136
No!

270
00:28:58,548 --> 00:29:02,245
These relics will enable us
to perform the ceremonies I spoke about.

271
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:05,220
- I'm asking you to buy them.
- Just on your word?

272
00:29:05,289 --> 00:29:07,189
Just on my word!

273
00:29:07,991 --> 00:29:09,151
I see.

274
00:29:11,895 --> 00:29:13,556
What is the price?

275
00:29:16,767 --> 00:29:18,667
1,000 guineas.

276
00:29:19,469 --> 00:29:22,336
- What?
- You'll never regret it, I swear.

277
00:29:23,707 --> 00:29:26,073
I swear in his name.

278
00:29:35,619 --> 00:29:36,677
For all we know...

279
00:29:36,753 --> 00:29:39,722
Do I take it that you do not want
to remain in the circle?

280
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:40,984
No.

281
00:29:42,459 --> 00:29:43,790
Very well.

282
00:29:44,761 --> 00:29:46,251
We'll pay the price.

283
00:29:46,463 --> 00:29:49,626
You will be repaid a thousand times.

284
00:29:50,634 --> 00:29:53,364
And may the devil take good care of you.

285
00:31:10,447 --> 00:31:11,937
Is this way.

286
00:32:09,105 --> 00:32:10,504
There it is.

287
00:33:17,307 --> 00:33:20,504
- My God, I don't like this.
- Do you want to leave?

288
00:33:21,211 --> 00:33:23,406
- No, of course not.
- Then keep quiet.

289
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:28,618
- Whas that?
- Keep quiet.

290
00:33:31,888 --> 00:33:33,480
There's someone there.

291
00:33:36,593 --> 00:33:38,254
There's something there.

292
00:33:40,163 --> 00:33:41,892
Of course I'm here.

293
00:33:43,733 --> 00:33:46,133
Did you not expect me to be here?

294
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:50,763
- That was a damned fool thing to do.
- Possibly, but it amused me.

295
00:33:51,207 --> 00:33:53,471
- You have the casket?
- Yes.

296
00:33:53,777 --> 00:33:56,712
Les not waste any more time.
Bring it here.

297
00:34:04,854 --> 00:34:06,116
On there.

298
00:34:52,135 --> 00:34:55,070
The goblets! You brought them?

299
00:34:55,772 --> 00:34:57,433
Yes, they're here.

300
00:35:16,393 --> 00:35:17,655
Good.

301
00:35:57,967 --> 00:35:59,332
Hark, ye...

302
00:36:00,737 --> 00:36:02,830
O ye timeless ones...

303
00:36:03,707 --> 00:36:07,734
ye elementals of the earth, and of the air...

304
00:36:08,111 --> 00:36:10,909
and of fire, and of water.

305
00:36:11,181 --> 00:36:16,118
In the most august dread
of the supreme Prince of Darkness...

306
00:36:17,987 --> 00:36:21,582
and of his archangels
and angels of darkness...

307
00:36:22,358 --> 00:36:23,950
and his legions...

308
00:36:24,728 --> 00:36:28,789
draw near and do my bidding, I command!

309
00:39:19,569 --> 00:39:21,764
Now will you believe?

310
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,571
Now drink.

311
00:39:30,513 --> 00:39:32,947
Did you not hear me? I said drink.

312
00:39:33,683 --> 00:39:35,548
Drink! Do you hear me?

313
00:39:37,287 --> 00:39:39,255
Don't insult the master!

314
00:39:39,923 --> 00:39:42,391
- I can't.
- Drink, damn you!

315
00:39:46,596 --> 00:39:47,654
You!

316
00:39:48,564 --> 00:39:49,724
Drink!

317
00:39:58,107 --> 00:39:59,699
You fools.

318
00:40:00,109 --> 00:40:03,101
You pathetic, spineless fools.

319
00:40:03,446 --> 00:40:07,576
You drink then! You drink it!
You drink the filth!

320
00:40:40,183 --> 00:40:41,912
Help me!

321
00:41:11,781 --> 00:41:13,112
He's dead.

322
00:42:32,762 --> 00:42:35,424
- What do you want?
- William, what is it?

323
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,534
Now listen carefully.

324
00:42:40,636 --> 00:42:43,104
I was at home here all evening,
do you understand?

325
00:42:43,172 --> 00:42:45,766
- At home here?
- Yes, here.

326
00:42:47,076 --> 00:42:49,806
- Can't you understand that?
- Yes, but...

327
00:42:50,446 --> 00:42:51,811
If anybody asks.

328
00:42:51,914 --> 00:42:54,212
- But who could ask?
- Anybody!

329
00:42:55,051 --> 00:42:57,281
- Do you understand?
- Yes, dear.

330
00:42:58,688 --> 00:42:59,780
Good.

331
00:43:07,463 --> 00:43:09,590
- Where's Alice?
- In her room.

332
00:43:10,766 --> 00:43:13,234
You'd better tell her to do the same.

333
00:43:13,302 --> 00:43:15,702
Yes, I'll tell her,
but she's a headstrong girl.

334
00:43:15,771 --> 00:43:17,796
I'll tell her myself then!

335
00:43:19,142 --> 00:43:21,269
You'll tell me what, Father?

336
00:43:21,611 --> 00:43:24,239
Listen, Alice. Now listen carefully.

337
00:43:24,814 --> 00:43:28,181
I was at home here all evening.
Do you understand me?

338
00:43:31,254 --> 00:43:33,916
- Yes, I understand.
- Good.

339
00:43:34,857 --> 00:43:36,586
Now go back to bed.

340
00:43:38,261 --> 00:43:39,285
Both of you.

341
00:43:39,362 --> 00:43:41,091
- Are you sure...
- Go!

342
00:43:51,874 --> 00:43:55,435
- Won't you tell me whas wrong?
- No! Never.

343
00:43:56,212 --> 00:43:57,372
Never.

344
00:45:08,451 --> 00:45:10,919
They have destroyed my servant.

345
00:45:13,222 --> 00:45:15,520
They will be destroyed.

346
00:45:23,966 --> 00:45:25,365
- Come on, Jeremy!
- Come on, Lucy!

347
00:45:25,434 --> 00:45:27,561
Come through on the inside! Thas it.

348
00:45:27,637 --> 00:45:29,662
- Come on, Jeremy!
- Come on, Lucy!

349
00:45:29,739 --> 00:45:31,604
Come through on the inside.

350
00:45:31,674 --> 00:45:33,869
I won! Jeremy let me win.

351
00:45:34,176 --> 00:45:37,612
- No, is not true. I didn't.
- Yes, you did, but I don't care.

352
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,705
I'd rather cheat and win,
than not win at all.

353
00:45:39,782 --> 00:45:42,342
- There, isn't that honest of me?
- Very.

354
00:45:42,818 --> 00:45:45,548
Well, isn't anybody going to notice?

355
00:45:45,688 --> 00:45:48,680
- Notice? What? Where?
- No, look.

356
00:45:49,525 --> 00:45:51,152
Your ring.

357
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:54,058
Isn't it beautiful? Jeremy gave it to me.

358
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:56,958
- We're engaged.
- Does your father know?

359
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,067
No, of course not.

360
00:45:59,135 --> 00:46:02,730
- You can't talk to him these days.
- Father's not very well, anyway.

361
00:46:02,805 --> 00:46:05,296
- I am sorry.
- Come on, les go home.

362
00:46:05,374 --> 00:46:07,968
Alice has seen my ring,
and she is green with envy.

363
00:46:08,044 --> 00:46:09,841
Thas all I came out for.

364
00:46:14,216 --> 00:46:15,615
I'll race you home.

365
00:46:15,685 --> 00:46:18,677
Alice, what are you wearing
to the Allens' party on Friday?

366
00:46:19,155 --> 00:46:20,884
My primrose, I think.

367
00:46:20,956 --> 00:46:22,821
Good, that won't clash with my blue.

368
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:26,754
- Jeremy, what are you wearing?
- My pink, I think.

369
00:46:26,829 --> 00:46:29,525
Ripping! It won't clash with my yellow.

370
00:46:30,166 --> 00:46:32,600
Are you ready? Good. Go.

371
00:46:32,735 --> 00:46:34,930
We'll see you both on Friday.

372
00:46:45,114 --> 00:46:48,572
I'm sorry about your father, Paul.
Is it serious?

373
00:46:49,385 --> 00:46:50,852
Nobody knows.

374
00:46:51,354 --> 00:46:54,016
He came home the other night,
went straight to bed...

375
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:55,819
and he hasn't moved since.

376
00:46:56,058 --> 00:46:58,788
He won't see a doctor,
he won't see anyone.

377
00:46:59,161 --> 00:47:02,153
My father's been acting
rather strangely, too.

378
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:04,689
He's been drinking heavily.

379
00:47:04,767 --> 00:47:07,531
And that makes it even worse
for your mother.

380
00:47:08,738 --> 00:47:10,137
And for us.

381
00:47:12,208 --> 00:47:15,473
I'm sorry, Paul.
Whas wrong with everybody?

382
00:48:13,135 --> 00:48:14,796
Mother, have you...

383
00:48:16,906 --> 00:48:19,602
I'm sorry, I thought Mother was in here.
Excuse me.

384
00:48:19,675 --> 00:48:21,165
Just a minute.

385
00:48:27,783 --> 00:48:30,616
I see from your dress
you intend going out.

386
00:48:30,986 --> 00:48:33,420
Yes, Father, to the Allens' party.

387
00:48:33,622 --> 00:48:35,590
I wasn't told about this.

388
00:48:35,658 --> 00:48:37,683
I woulïve told you, only...

389
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:39,191
Only what?

390
00:48:41,931 --> 00:48:45,230
You haven't been very approachable lately,
have you?

391
00:48:45,734 --> 00:48:48,134
I mean, you haven't been quite yourself.

392
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:51,671
You think I've been drinking too much,
is that what you mean?

393
00:48:52,875 --> 00:48:55,571
- Is that it? Is that what you mean?
- Yes.

394
00:48:56,479 --> 00:48:57,776
Yes, Father.

395
00:48:58,581 --> 00:48:59,741
I see.

396
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,652
Who is taking you to this party?

397
00:49:07,823 --> 00:49:10,018
- Paul.
- I forbid it.

398
00:49:13,863 --> 00:49:17,128
- I forbid it. Go and get those things off.
- But...

399
00:49:59,441 --> 00:50:01,136
Good evening, Mr. Paxton.

400
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:05,011
My daughter will not be coming
to the party. So you can go.

401
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,878
- May I ask why not, sir?
- No, you may not.

402
00:50:09,151 --> 00:50:11,984
- Is she ill?
- No, she's perfectly well, thank you.

403
00:50:12,121 --> 00:50:15,579
It is just my wish
that she should not go out this evening.

404
00:50:16,692 --> 00:50:18,023
Excuse me.

405
00:50:25,401 --> 00:50:28,700
May I ask you one more question?
I think I have the right.

406
00:50:28,771 --> 00:50:32,400
Why do you hate me?
What is it I've done to offend you?

407
00:50:32,975 --> 00:50:36,103
You don't have to do anything
to offend me, young man.

408
00:50:36,178 --> 00:50:37,440
Drive on!

409
00:51:10,813 --> 00:51:12,906
Coming to the party, Alice?

410
00:51:13,015 --> 00:51:15,483
I can't. Father won't let me.

411
00:51:16,085 --> 00:51:19,851
I said, are you coming to the party, Alice?

412
00:51:21,724 --> 00:51:23,282
Just give me a moment.

413
00:51:53,789 --> 00:51:57,555
As to the place where it happened,
I have been making discreet inquiries...

414
00:51:57,626 --> 00:52:01,153
and have ascertained, as far as I am able,
that no one ever goes there.

415
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:05,223
So, short of one or all of us
returning there...

416
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:06,324
No.

417
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:11,137
No, I must confess
I should not relish such a journey myself.

418
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,470
Short of us going
and seeing for ourselves...

419
00:52:13,542 --> 00:52:17,308
I think we can safely assume
that the body will remain where it is...

420
00:52:17,646 --> 00:52:20,672
until either it rots,
or is discovered by some tramp...

421
00:52:20,849 --> 00:52:23,283
who is unlikely to give the alarm.

422
00:52:26,188 --> 00:52:28,156
What you're saying is...

423
00:52:28,957 --> 00:52:30,948
it looks like we've got away with it.

424
00:52:31,026 --> 00:52:34,052
As you say,
it looks as though we've got away with it.

425
00:52:34,196 --> 00:52:36,494
All that remains is for us to establish...

426
00:52:36,565 --> 00:52:39,295
that none of us were away
from our homes that evening.

427
00:52:39,368 --> 00:52:42,235
I understand it is
what the police call an alibi.

428
00:52:43,138 --> 00:52:44,605
That is quite right.

429
00:52:45,074 --> 00:52:48,009
- Well, if there is nothing else...
- No.

430
00:52:48,077 --> 00:52:51,205
Then I shall declare that,
not only is this meeting closed...

431
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,373
but that it never occurred.

432
00:52:53,582 --> 00:52:54,674
Good.

433
00:53:05,894 --> 00:53:08,362
- You'd better keep an eye on him.
- An eye?

434
00:53:08,664 --> 00:53:11,758
Yes, on his drinking.
It might loosen his tongue.

435
00:53:12,134 --> 00:53:13,396
I'll try.

436
00:53:49,605 --> 00:53:51,732
I did enjoy the party, Paul.

437
00:53:58,514 --> 00:54:00,243
I must go in, Paul.

438
00:54:12,761 --> 00:54:15,161
- Good night, darling.
- I love you.

439
00:54:34,917 --> 00:54:36,111
Father.

440
00:54:39,521 --> 00:54:41,284
I went to the party.

441
00:54:54,303 --> 00:54:56,931
With Paul. Father, I love him.

442
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,401
- I know it was wrong of me.
- Yes.

443
00:55:01,577 --> 00:55:03,374
It was wrong of you.

444
00:55:03,645 --> 00:55:06,546
- I'm sorry, Father.
- And you're going to be punished for it.

445
00:55:06,615 --> 00:55:10,073
- Father, I've said I'm sorry.
- I'm going to punish you.

446
00:55:13,121 --> 00:55:15,248
I'm going to whip you, Alice.

447
00:55:15,591 --> 00:55:17,115
Don't touch me.

448
00:55:18,293 --> 00:55:20,659
Whip you, Alice.

449
00:55:21,096 --> 00:55:24,429
- Please don't touch me.
- And I haven't beaten you...

450
00:55:26,201 --> 00:55:28,396
since you were a little girl...

451
00:55:28,971 --> 00:55:30,302
have I, Alice?

452
00:55:31,206 --> 00:55:32,537
Let me go!

453
00:55:35,644 --> 00:55:38,374
If you touch me, Father,
I'll never forgive you.

454
00:56:00,135 --> 00:56:01,534
Paul, is...

455
00:56:10,445 --> 00:56:11,844
Who are you?

456
00:56:14,149 --> 00:56:15,844
How do you know my name?

457
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,291
Come here.

458
00:58:08,697 --> 00:58:10,460
Damn you, come here!

459
00:58:15,337 --> 00:58:17,862
Alice, you're going to be whipped.

460
00:58:18,607 --> 00:58:21,371
Whipped, do you hear me? Whipped.

461
00:58:26,648 --> 00:58:27,740
Now.

462
00:58:27,816 --> 00:58:29,374
Whipped, do you hear me?

463
00:58:54,676 --> 00:58:56,701
The first.

464
00:58:59,114 --> 00:59:00,741
Is nasty, that.

465
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:04,681
Very nasty. Is nasty, Evans.
Get it cleared up, will you?

466
00:59:04,753 --> 00:59:05,742
Yes, sir.

467
00:59:22,104 --> 00:59:23,264
Hello.

468
00:59:23,872 --> 00:59:28,002
I just came to see the lady of the house,
sir, about him out there.

469
00:59:28,410 --> 00:59:32,403
Mrs. Hargood is suffering from shock.
I'm Paul Paxton. My sister's with her.

470
00:59:32,481 --> 00:59:35,006
Perhaps I'd better come back
some other time, sir.

471
00:59:35,083 --> 00:59:37,643
We can't do very much
for him out there, can we?

472
00:59:37,719 --> 00:59:39,744
Except take him out of the flower beds.

473
00:59:39,821 --> 00:59:42,187
But what about his daughter,
Alice Hargood?

474
00:59:42,257 --> 00:59:44,350
She been done in, too, sir?

475
00:59:44,626 --> 00:59:46,890
God knows, but she's missing.

476
00:59:47,596 --> 00:59:49,689
- Only missing.
- Only?

477
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,264
Yes, since last night.

478
00:59:54,769 --> 00:59:57,237
- Is she a young girl, sir?
- Yes.

479
00:59:57,706 --> 01:00:00,072
- Trouble in the home?
- Yes.

480
01:00:00,642 --> 01:00:03,475
Familiar story, sir.
I won't keep you any longer.

481
01:00:03,545 --> 01:00:05,979
But what are you going to do about her?

482
01:00:06,047 --> 01:00:07,912
What do you want me to do about her?

483
01:00:07,983 --> 01:00:11,146
Issue a description. Send her picture
to all your police stations.

484
01:00:11,219 --> 01:00:15,383
My dear sir, if we were to do that with
every young girl that runs from home...

485
01:00:15,457 --> 01:00:17,220
we wouldn't have time for anything else.

486
01:00:17,292 --> 01:00:21,626
- She has not run away.
- How do you know that, sir?

487
01:00:22,631 --> 01:00:26,931
- I just know it!
- I see, sir. You just know it.

488
01:00:27,068 --> 01:00:30,629
I'm sure you have other things
to attend to, like me, sir.

489
01:00:30,705 --> 01:00:34,232
- So if you'll excuse me.
- Look, is a raw morning.

490
01:00:34,342 --> 01:00:38,369
I'm sure Mrs. Hargood wouldn't want you
to leave without a little refreshment.

491
01:00:38,747 --> 01:00:41,716
I won't while I'm on duty, sir.
Good morning.

492
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:44,546
Evans, you got that mess cleared up
outside there yet?

493
01:00:49,758 --> 01:00:53,558
"We beseech thee, O Father,
to raise us from the death of sin...

494
01:00:53,662 --> 01:00:57,655
"unto the life of righteousness,
that when we shall depart this life...

495
01:00:57,732 --> 01:01:01,725
"we may rest in him,
as our hope is this our brother doth...

496
01:01:01,903 --> 01:01:04,895
"and that at the general resurrection
in the last day...

497
01:01:04,973 --> 01:01:09,603
"we may be found acceptable in thy sight
and receive that blessing...

498
01:01:09,678 --> 01:01:12,579
"which thy well-beloved Son
shall then pronounce...

499
01:01:12,647 --> 01:01:14,672
"to all that love and fear thee...

500
01:01:14,749 --> 01:01:19,152
"through Jesus Christ
our mediator and redeemer. Amen.

501
01:01:20,622 --> 01:01:25,025
"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
and the love of God...

502
01:01:25,293 --> 01:01:30,196
"and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost,
be with us all evermore.

503
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:32,393
"Amen."

504
01:01:44,346 --> 01:01:47,076
- I'll see Mrs. Hargood home.
- All right.

505
01:02:08,737 --> 01:02:11,103
Why are you here?
Why are you dressed like that?

506
01:02:11,172 --> 01:02:12,400
I can't tell you now.

507
01:02:12,474 --> 01:02:15,272
Come to my house tonight.
I'll tell you everything then.

508
01:02:15,343 --> 01:02:17,470
- In the garden.
- Why the garden?

509
01:02:20,815 --> 01:02:24,012
I can't explain now, my dear,
but do come, please.

510
01:02:24,286 --> 01:02:27,187
- Yes, all right.
- And not a word to anybody, not to a soul.

511
01:02:27,289 --> 01:02:28,483
Promise?

512
01:02:30,592 --> 01:02:33,459
- All right, I promise.
- Thank you, Lucy.

513
01:02:44,439 --> 01:02:46,373
- Sorry, Jeremy.
- Come on.

514
01:02:46,541 --> 01:02:49,203
- Hope they haven't left us behind.
- We can always walk.

515
01:02:51,413 --> 01:02:54,974
I'm afraid the mistress isn't well enough
to see anyone at the moment, sir.

516
01:02:55,050 --> 01:02:59,077
- What name shall I say called?
- My name's Secker. Here's my card.

517
01:02:59,454 --> 01:03:03,413
- I'll call again. Good evening.
- Good evening, Mr. Secker.

518
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:07,094
Betty, I'm just going.

519
01:03:07,329 --> 01:03:10,389
If anything should happen, you know...

520
01:03:11,466 --> 01:03:14,663
- let me know at once, will you?
- Very good, sir.

521
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:22,437
- I'm Paul Paxton, sir.
- Yes, I know.

522
01:03:23,378 --> 01:03:27,280
- Is a terrible business.
- Yes. Did you know Mr. Hargood well?

523
01:03:27,949 --> 01:03:29,314
We had met.

524
01:03:30,018 --> 01:03:32,179
Did you know
that his daughter had disappeared?

525
01:03:32,253 --> 01:03:34,517
- I had heard. Is there any news?
- Nothing.

526
01:03:34,589 --> 01:03:37,353
- The police?
- They're worse than useless.

527
01:03:37,926 --> 01:03:41,828
I go to the station at least four times
every day to ask if they've any news.

528
01:03:41,896 --> 01:03:44,057
They've told me
not to bother them anymore.

529
01:03:44,132 --> 01:03:47,693
As far as you know, they are not
carrying out any proper investigation?

530
01:03:47,802 --> 01:03:51,101
As far as I know,
they are doing absolutely nothing.

531
01:03:52,941 --> 01:03:55,171
Someone's got to do something.

532
01:03:58,213 --> 01:03:59,737
I love Alice...

533
01:04:00,548 --> 01:04:05,485
and to know that she's somewhere in need
of help, and nobody doing anything to...

534
01:04:06,388 --> 01:04:09,357
Be careful, Paul. Don't do anything...

535
01:04:10,625 --> 01:04:12,354
that you may be sorry for.

536
01:04:12,427 --> 01:04:15,658
I couldn't be any sorrier than I am now,
Mr. Secker.

537
01:04:16,664 --> 01:04:17,995
Good night, sir.

538
01:04:57,739 --> 01:04:59,536
I'm over here, Lucy.

539
01:05:01,443 --> 01:05:03,138
- Where?
- Over here.

540
01:05:07,081 --> 01:05:08,708
You must be frozen.

541
01:05:08,783 --> 01:05:10,808
- Why are you dressed like that?
- Secret.

542
01:05:10,885 --> 01:05:13,683
- But I don't understand.
- You will. Follow me.

543
01:05:13,788 --> 01:05:16,154
- But why?
- Come along.

544
01:05:29,704 --> 01:05:32,172
- Alice, what is all this?
- Come on.

545
01:05:38,346 --> 01:05:40,246
Whose carriage is this?

546
01:05:41,349 --> 01:05:43,874
Alice, you haven't eloped, have you?

547
01:05:49,991 --> 01:05:51,049
No!

548
01:05:53,428 --> 01:05:55,521
Please!

549
01:06:01,836 --> 01:06:03,098
Stop it!

550
01:06:10,545 --> 01:06:12,604
Alice, tell him to stop!

551
01:06:19,954 --> 01:06:22,616
Really, what do you think that...

552
01:06:26,127 --> 01:06:28,493
Come on, Lucy.

553
01:06:28,563 --> 01:06:30,622
Where are we going, Alice?

554
01:06:46,014 --> 01:06:47,914
- Come on.
- Where are we?

555
01:06:48,616 --> 01:06:52,074
- Come on, Lucy.
- Where are we going?

556
01:07:25,019 --> 01:07:28,386
- Alice, why are we here?
- I want you to meet someone.

557
01:07:29,557 --> 01:07:32,048
Is it your lover? Where is he?

558
01:08:04,425 --> 01:08:06,120
Alice, I'm afraid.

559
01:08:12,166 --> 01:08:14,896
- You're hurting me.
- Do as he tells you.

560
01:09:14,195 --> 01:09:17,289
I know I shouldn't have come here,
but I had to.

561
01:09:17,732 --> 01:09:20,030
- You see, I know.
- Know what?

562
01:09:21,969 --> 01:09:24,995
First Hargood, then his girl...

563
01:09:26,007 --> 01:09:28,532
then Lucy. Gone!

564
01:09:29,110 --> 01:09:31,078
Is him. Is Courtley.

565
01:09:32,613 --> 01:09:35,673
- Pull yourself together.
- Don't you see? It must be.

566
01:09:36,150 --> 01:09:39,415
He's come back to punish us
for what we did to him.

567
01:09:40,822 --> 01:09:42,813
- Don't you see?
- Drink it.

568
01:09:46,027 --> 01:09:48,860
- What are we going to do?
- Make sure.

569
01:09:49,197 --> 01:09:52,132
- What?
- I can't believe it, but we'll make sure.

570
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:53,258
How?

571
01:09:53,367 --> 01:09:56,803
By finding out
if the body of Courtley is still there.

572
01:09:57,405 --> 01:09:58,429
I can't.

573
01:09:58,506 --> 01:10:01,441
You can and will. Now!

574
01:10:54,996 --> 01:10:58,193
- Well, it would seem that you were right.
- My God.

575
01:11:01,469 --> 01:11:04,529
Unless, of course,
someone has hidden the body.

576
01:11:05,339 --> 01:11:06,670
Hidden it?

577
01:11:07,742 --> 01:11:10,336
But who? What for?

578
01:11:11,212 --> 01:11:13,612
I only offer it as a possibility.

579
01:11:14,115 --> 01:11:16,310
I think, however, we should make sure.

580
01:11:40,975 --> 01:11:42,909
This has been disturbed.

581
01:11:43,845 --> 01:11:45,107
Help me.

582
01:11:56,424 --> 01:11:57,686
Come on.

583
01:12:05,266 --> 01:12:06,460
My God.

584
01:12:07,435 --> 01:12:10,495
Is Lucy. She's dead.

585
01:12:10,771 --> 01:12:13,262
No, she's not dead.

586
01:12:14,242 --> 01:12:15,607
What do you mean?

587
01:12:16,210 --> 01:12:18,440
She's neither dead nor alive.

588
01:12:21,182 --> 01:12:23,446
Look at the marks on her neck.

589
01:12:23,818 --> 01:12:27,117
Marks? I don't understand.

590
01:12:35,496 --> 01:12:38,556
Paxton, listen to me!
The marks on her neck...

591
01:12:38,633 --> 01:12:40,225
She's a vampire!

592
01:12:42,970 --> 01:12:44,699
I don't understand.

593
01:12:45,406 --> 01:12:46,805
Oh, my God.

594
01:12:48,109 --> 01:12:52,068
- What can we do?
- I believe there is a way to release her.

595
01:12:53,447 --> 01:12:54,846
Release her?

596
01:12:56,117 --> 01:12:59,575
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

597
01:13:03,090 --> 01:13:05,820
Drive a wooden stake through her heart.

598
01:13:05,893 --> 01:13:08,361
Only then will she be free to die.

599
01:13:08,629 --> 01:13:09,960
If not...

600
01:13:10,765 --> 01:13:14,098
she will live out
her nightmare existence forever...

601
01:13:15,603 --> 01:13:19,562
wandering about in the night,
living off the blood of animals...

602
01:13:21,442 --> 01:13:24,172
and of human beings like herself.

603
01:13:25,413 --> 01:13:26,471
No.

604
01:13:30,651 --> 01:13:33,176
The decision is yours, as her father.

605
01:13:34,055 --> 01:13:35,886
I can't!

606
01:13:38,392 --> 01:13:42,192
I will do it, then.
You go away from here until I call you.

607
01:13:42,797 --> 01:13:46,358
- And when you return, she'll be at peace.
- No, I'll stay.

608
01:14:04,518 --> 01:14:06,042
Get out of here!

609
01:14:06,787 --> 01:14:09,255
Get out of here.
Leave us alone, do you hear?

610
01:14:13,527 --> 01:14:15,722
I'll shoot you again if you don't get out.

611
01:14:15,796 --> 01:14:17,889
- Paxton...
- Get out!

612
01:15:49,590 --> 01:15:50,682
Now.

613
01:16:05,206 --> 01:16:06,935
Help me!

614
01:16:25,059 --> 01:16:26,993
The second.

615
01:18:44,298 --> 01:18:46,095
Mrs. Hargood, ma'am.

616
01:18:48,736 --> 01:18:51,364
- Yes, Betty?
- Mr. Paul is here, ma'am.

617
01:18:55,109 --> 01:18:57,805
- Ask him to come in, Betty.
- Yes, ma'am.

618
01:19:09,156 --> 01:19:10,919
Will you go in, sir?

619
01:19:25,572 --> 01:19:27,904
- Mrs. Hargood?
- Nothing?

620
01:19:30,644 --> 01:19:33,340
We've searched everywhere, Jeremy and I.

621
01:19:33,814 --> 01:19:36,942
Every field for miles around, every ditch.

622
01:19:38,152 --> 01:19:40,950
Is that where you expect to find her, Paul?

623
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:42,886
You think she's dead.

624
01:19:47,461 --> 01:19:49,895
Why has this happened to us, Paul?

625
01:19:50,998 --> 01:19:54,195
- What have we ever done?
- God knows, Mrs. Hargood.

626
01:19:57,504 --> 01:19:58,994
Does he, Paul?

627
01:20:15,923 --> 01:20:17,117
Father?

628
01:20:22,463 --> 01:20:23,862
Lucy, what...

629
01:20:30,371 --> 01:20:32,999
- Where have you been?
- Kiss me, Jeremy.

630
01:20:33,674 --> 01:20:36,939
- Lucy, my love.
- Kiss me, my darling.

631
01:20:38,979 --> 01:20:40,207
Oh, God!

632
01:21:05,272 --> 01:21:08,799
Jeremy, thank God is you.
For a moment, I thought it was...

633
01:21:09,042 --> 01:21:11,704
There's something
that you must do for me immediately.

634
01:21:11,779 --> 01:21:16,182
This letter's got to go to young Paxton,
to Paul, you know. I want you to...

635
01:21:21,555 --> 01:21:22,783
Not you.

636
01:21:56,657 --> 01:21:58,056
The third.

637
01:22:00,494 --> 01:22:02,428
Master...

638
01:22:03,564 --> 01:22:05,054
did I do well?

639
01:22:05,365 --> 01:22:06,992
Did I please you?

640
01:22:07,668 --> 01:22:08,760
Wait.

641
01:22:12,172 --> 01:22:13,366
Please.

642
01:22:14,408 --> 01:22:16,569
Please wait. Please.

643
01:22:56,950 --> 01:23:00,613
As it was addressed to you, sir,
I thought you might like to have it.

644
01:23:00,721 --> 01:23:04,179
I opened it because I thought
it might throw some light on all this.

645
01:23:04,258 --> 01:23:08,024
- And did it?
- Ramblings of a lunatic, sir. You'll see.

646
01:23:08,395 --> 01:23:11,660
He goes on here
about vampires and suchlike.

647
01:23:12,599 --> 01:23:15,227
You couldn't have a clearer case, sir.

648
01:23:15,903 --> 01:23:17,598
Son hates his father...

649
01:23:17,671 --> 01:23:21,471
he's hot-blooded, they quarrel,
and the son loses his temper.

650
01:23:21,975 --> 01:23:24,068
Quite straightforward, sir.

651
01:23:24,578 --> 01:23:29,208
However, we've got him locked up
safe and sound.

652
01:23:30,584 --> 01:23:33,747
But Jeremy did not hate his father.
He was one of the most even...

653
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:38,655
- lf you've come here to obstruct justice...
- I came here because you sent for me.

654
01:23:39,293 --> 01:23:42,956
Here's your letter, sir.
I shan't need to see you anymore.

655
01:23:44,298 --> 01:23:47,529
- And don't go touching that, will you, sir?
- No.

656
01:24:11,358 --> 01:24:12,552
Master.

657
01:24:38,118 --> 01:24:41,019
You have the courage to do
what has to be done...

658
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:43,215
and above all...

659
01:24:44,157 --> 01:24:48,218
your love for Alice will act as
your strength and your protection.

660
01:24:49,296 --> 01:24:51,264
And you must believe me.

661
01:24:51,698 --> 01:24:54,565
You must arm yourself
with knowledge, Paul.

662
01:24:55,268 --> 01:24:59,261
And so you will see that, while there is
little hope for your dear sister...

663
01:24:59,339 --> 01:25:01,239
Alice may have escaped.

664
01:25:01,608 --> 01:25:04,634
Find her, Paul,
and find her before nightfall.

665
01:25:05,479 --> 01:25:08,312
Only then will you know the truth.

666
01:25:09,516 --> 01:25:12,349
We know that she is under his influence...

667
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:16,587
but she may not yet be his sister in blood.

668
01:25:17,190 --> 01:25:18,418
Not yet.

669
01:25:18,925 --> 01:25:22,258
So find her, Paul. Find her!

670
01:25:23,697 --> 01:25:25,961
Find her before it is too late.

671
01:30:35,775 --> 01:30:36,799
Take it away.

672
01:30:36,876 --> 01:30:38,969
You must give it to me,
or we will punish you.

673
01:30:39,045 --> 01:30:42,378
You're free, Alice.
Free to choose good or evil.

674
01:30:42,449 --> 01:30:45,418
You're not one of them yet.
You're free to choose.

675
01:30:45,485 --> 01:30:49,421
- I must do as he says. He's my master.
- He's not!

676
01:30:58,765 --> 01:31:02,223
Did I do well, master?
Take me with you, master.

677
01:31:02,435 --> 01:31:04,630
I have no further use for you.

678
01:31:37,504 --> 01:31:40,905
Run, Alice!
Run as fast as you can away from here.

679
01:31:40,974 --> 01:31:44,671
Not without you, Paul.
Please, you must come, too. He'll kill us!

680
01:31:45,945 --> 01:31:47,572
- Please.
- I can't go.

681
01:31:47,647 --> 01:31:49,342
Please, Paul.

682
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:55,779
Please run. Do as I say!

683
01:35:16,222 --> 01:35:17,587
English

684
01:35:18,305 --> 01:35:24,184
