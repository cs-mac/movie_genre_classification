1
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,112
Turning to our home scene in New York:

2
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:13,282
The US dollar moved
in a range of only 10 to 20 points.

3
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,954
The mayor was dumb.

4
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:22,583
And the council stood as if
they were changed into blocks of wood.

5
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,256
Give me your towel.

6
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:32,843
I want to see what's underneath.
Come on, let me see that.

7
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,554
Learn a thing or two.
I need this towel. I want it.

8
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:39,558
I have to dry my hair. I have
to dry my fingernails. Give me this towel.

9
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:44,021
Hell of a time for a vacation.

10
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:47,316
A hell of a time is right.

11
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,153
Your dad snaps his fingers
and you jump like a jack-in-the-box.

12
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,948
He calls on one day and the next day
you're off to Vermont.

13
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:57,326
It's the only time he can get away.

14
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,995
And he likes it there.

15
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,872
And I like it there.

16
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:19,765
Who's been shelling the kitchen?
What's going on here? Maneuvers?

17
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,309
No, I'm looking for the prize.

18
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:24,686
The prize is in the bottom of the box.

19
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:26,688
Can I take it with me?

20
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:29,191
It's not the prize, it's the flakes all over.

21
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,361
All right, let's go.
Your mother's going to yell at us.

22
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,113
No fair.

23
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,783
You're breaking my heart.

24
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:39,701
Hang on a minute.

25
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,872
Here it is. What have we got here?

26
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,502
It's a double over-and-under
space flyer upside-down flotsam.

27
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:51,880
How about a kiss for your old dad?

28
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:54,216
I love you, Daddy.

29
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,095
I love you, too.

30
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:05,561
"... the world of traffic",
we have a few problems...

31
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:07,396
Peter, how about the carpet?

32
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,900
It's not the Golden Fleece, you know.

33
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,445
"... as well", "yes",
we could expect more trouble...

34
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,907
You could take the weekend.

35
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,827
We sang this song already, didn't we?

36
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,871
Okay, I won't press it.

37
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:27,791
- Don't sit around driving yourself crazy.
- Let me tell you about crazy.

38
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:31,962
If Eliot gives me this, it can mean a senior
vice-presidency, maybe next year...

39
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:36,049
a seat on the board, not to mention
another $25,000 per annum...

40
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:39,094
which means a lot of things,
like the mortgage on this dump.

41
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,431
- Daddy offered us the mortgage.
- "Daddy offered."

42
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:47,186
Your daddy's very sweet, but he didn't
pay for this place. He didn't pick it out.

43
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:52,149
We found it, paid for it, renovated it
and we pay off the mortgage ourselves.

44
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,237
Besides which, if I get this...

45
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:00,991
maybe I'll buy you your own
damn ski resort. What do you think?

46
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,161
I think you'll get it.

47
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,788
I better, because if I don't get it...

48
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:10,751
next month the world will see us
pitching pennies in Guatemala.

49
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,339
It'd be fun with you in Guatemala.

50
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,008
Peter, be careful.

51
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,515
I'll call you tonight.

52
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:28,435
Call before midnight.
I turn into a pumpkin.

53
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,395
- A beautiful pumpkin.
- You're biased.

54
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,688
You're right. I am.

55
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:35,067
All right, champ, keep it under 70.
Take care of your mom.

56
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,819
- Have fun.
- I love you.

57
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,092
- A little Mozart in the morning?
- Good morning, Mr. Hughes.

58
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,907
- Hi, Karen.
- Good morning.

59
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,243
- Pyramid Industries.
- It's too early for word association.

60
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:10,579
You take a shot for that?

61
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,957
I'll bite. Pyramid Industries
is Arab money in whiteface.

62
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:17,836
They're trying to cop
this country's grain belt. What's it to you?

63
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,173
Riverton's given Pyramid to me.
I sent Janis to pick up the files.

64
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:22,424
Is that all right?

65
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:28,972
Pyramid Industries
was Capstan International.

66
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:31,308
Here's the rest of it.

67
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,186
- Thanks.
- Good morning.

68
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,647
Why so cheerful?

69
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,691
I ran into James Hall on my way in.

70
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,986
I wouldn't let him walk behind me
unless I had a rear-view mirror.

71
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,698
Why did Riverton give him the Pyramid
Industries merger? That was mine!

72
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,034
Don't sweat it. Rumors are flying...

73
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,496
Riverton's going to give that
re-organization assignment to somebody.

74
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,540
And all bets are in your favor.

75
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:56,667
All this intrigue.

76
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:00,170
This isn't a trust company,
it's the court of Louis XIV.

77
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:11,265
You were having a lot of fun
with Pyramid Industries, weren't you?

78
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:14,518
Yeah, I was.
Mergers like Pyramid are my strong suit.

79
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,896
I don't know a damn thing
about reorganizing bank branches.

80
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:23,193
- But if Eliot gives you this"..."
- I know. The sky's the limit.

81
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,529
It's 9:00.

82
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,493
How do you stay ahead of everything?

83
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:35,205
I've seen what happens
if I don't stay two paces ahead of you.

84
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,542
- Pretty blouse.
- Thanks.

85
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:42,212
- You've got a thread hanging there.
- Only you'd notice.

86
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,298
Details, darling, details.

87
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,768
Know how I'd go about revamping
the Commercial American branches?

88
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:59,354
A volley of mortar fire
followed by a flamethrower.

89
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,231
- Excellent.
- Good morning.

90
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:07,029
It's a little restless in there. I wanted
to speak to you before we get started.

91
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:09,323
Keep Thursday night open.

92
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,993
A dinner party for the L.A.
branch managers. Nothing elaborate.

93
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:16,914
Besides, I want to see your pretty wife,
whom I haven't seen in ages.

94
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,001
Meg's with her dad in Vermont.
But let us not stand on ceremony.

95
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:25,339
Why in the name of Joe did you pitch
that Pyramid thing to James Hall?

96
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,925
I was flying with that grain deal.

97
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,762
I need a hands-on guy, Bart...

98
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,682
to handle the reorganization of all
the branch offices of this trust company.

99
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:38,769
Somebody with new ideas,
not old ones with a face-lift.

100
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,688
- This is the topic of the day.
- The topic is over.

101
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:44,399
I need a package
for the board meeting in two weeks.

102
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:46,568
- In two weeks?
- Can you do it?

103
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:51,532
- I'll have to shift things.
- Which is why I gave Pyramid to Hall.

104
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,867
Lorrie can handle
whatever else you've got.

105
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:56,954
I'll give it a shot.

106
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,957
It's yours. 'Cause you know
what's riding on it.

107
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,206
Shit!

108
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:39,473
Oh, Lord, I don't need this.
I really don't need this.

109
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:14,466
"I appreciate this. I couldn"'"t get"
my plumber for another 10 days.

110
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,052
- "Can you believe that?"
- "You should"'"ve called me first."

111
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:20,889
Everybody calls you, relies on you.
You got your own building next door.

112
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:25,185
Look at this. It's what I told you. See this?

113
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:28,480
Smell it. That's dishwashing stuff.
I told you that before.

114
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:31,483
- It's not the sink?
- It's the dishwasher, like I said.

115
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:33,944
My wife had this thing
overhauled a month ago.

116
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,280
Don't worry about nothing.
It's not the motor.

117
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,657
Here, I got the problem. Look at this.

118
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:43,662
- You see that? That's your drain hose.
- Wait.

119
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,959
- You ready for that?
- What could cause that?

120
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:53,505
What causes that is extreme heat
from the machine here, and the casing"..."

121
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:56,675
- Just, "bang"?
- Bang! General wear and tear, too.

122
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,011
Did you see any mice?

123
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:01,346
Mice? No, I got no mice here.

124
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:05,601
If you had, you'd see them because
it'd take an army of mice to do that.

125
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:06,935
Maybe it's a rat.

126
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:11,982
A rat? No, there's no mice here.
There's no rat in this house.

127
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,359
There's no rat in this house?

128
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:19,865
What are you trying to say?
I need an exterminator?

129
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:24,536
That's for old ladies and people
who don't want their hands dirty.

130
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,332
- You have a problem with that?
- I got no problem getting my hands dirty.

131
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,626
I renovated this house
from the bottom up.

132
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,212
Very nice.

133
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:37,508
It'd be horrible if an exterminator came
and unrenovated it from bottom up...

134
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:42,095
tore out your cabinetry. Took this out.
That's what they do. They wreck the place.

135
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:46,183
No. Wait a minute. Nobody's tearing out
nothing. You mind, by the way?

136
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,644
What? I'm sorry.

137
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:54,816
- You did beautiful work over here.
- You got any other ideas?

138
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:56,652
You got any traps?

139
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:59,404
I got some left over from
when I rebuilt the basement.

140
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:01,823
You should put them out.

141
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:03,825
A rat could eat through this?

142
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:06,411
You're kidding, right?
You ever see a rat's teeth?

143
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,872
A rat could eat through electrical wiring.

144
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:12,918
- I'll put down some traps.
- You know what the trouble with traps is?

145
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:16,839
You got yourself an intelligent rat,
he'll snatch the food from the trap...

146
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:19,716
eat it and run around here
creating general havoc.

147
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,760
I should think he'd be happier in the Bronx.

148
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:27,099
I tell you, a rat could be happy anywhere.

149
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,937
Let me ask you something.
Is this real tile?

150
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:35,774
- It's beautiful.
- I'm glad you like it.

151
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:37,776
This is beautiful.

152
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:40,529
Good morning, Eliot.

153
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:53,584
Back in the office, Junior.

154
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:11,101
Hi, honey. So did you get it?

155
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:15,105
I knew you would. I'm so proud of you.

156
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:18,483
The bad news is he only gave me
two weeks for the whole package.

157
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,487
Peter, could you calm down?

158
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:24,364
Two weeks?

159
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:27,117
I think he's putting me
under the gun on purpose.

160
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:33,457
I know, but Hall and his cronies
are waiting for me to fall on my ass.

161
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:37,503
So they're lvy League.
That doesn't guarantee everything in life.

162
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:40,506
Eliot worked his way up just like you.

163
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:42,883
I know, but it's a tough package.

164
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:45,469
Working harder
doesn't guarantee anything either.

165
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:48,347
Bart, you'll pull it off. I know you will.

166
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:53,435
Peter's giving Daddy a cardiac arrest.
I'll call you later.

167
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:54,686
I love you.

168
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,271
I love you, too.

169
00:14:57,773 --> 00:14:58,815
He got it!

170
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:00,984
Los Angeles branch.

171
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,695
Speak the King's English.
What're you saying?

172
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:05,239
The review, the meeting.

173
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,115
You all right? You look tired.

174
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,577
It's a boring story.
What's this dork's name again?

175
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:12,871
- Thompson. Los Angeles.
- Right.

176
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:39,273
- Anything interesting there?
- Any luck with the traps?

177
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:40,899
I'll soon find out.

178
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:37,456
Rats, my butt.

179
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:09,821
Good Lord!

180
00:17:17,496 --> 00:17:18,664
What's this?

181
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:24,169
You see that? Super Rat did that.

182
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:26,255
You gonna nail him with this?

183
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:31,093
Who gave you this? Your grandma?
These are antiquated traps.

184
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:34,137
- You got to get proper traps.
- There must be a better way.

185
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:37,766
There's only five ways:
You trap them, you poison them...

186
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:41,520
you knock them on the head,
you gas them, or you shoot them.

187
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:45,524
But you got to remember one thing:
a rat is a survivor.

188
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:47,359
The best there is.

189
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:49,528
- Know where I learned that?
- Where?

190
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,489
- In the army. Were you in the army?
- No.

191
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:54,449
I was. At Enewetak Island.

192
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:57,244
You never heard of that?

193
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:59,538
It's the atomic test site. I was there.

194
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:02,833
The huge blast.
A couple of seconds, everything was dead.

195
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:07,546
Insects, reptiles, frigging amoeba,
plant life. They all croaked.

196
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:12,217
Except for the rats. They survived.
And they multiplied tenfold.

197
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:15,304
So get rid of grandma's souvenir.

198
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:21,226
See that little dog with that lady?
That's Mrs. Dinovi, apartment 305.

199
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,562
Look at those legs.
Best legs in the building.

200
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:25,272
She cut herself shaving again.

201
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:27,566
You know what's the matter with you?

202
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:29,735
You don't realize you're spending...

203
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:32,070
twenty percent of your time
thinking about him.

204
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:36,658
But he's spending 100 percent of his time
figuring out ways to outsmart you.

205
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:39,912
'Cause he's a rat.
He's got nothing better to do.

206
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:42,414
You want a pear?

207
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:01,058
Tell Lorrie I need the rest
of the Los Angeles demographics...

208
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,936
- and I'm taking an early lunch.
- "Certainly", "Mr. Hughes."

209
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:30,462
Oh, no.

210
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:01,702
Hi, guys.

211
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:05,247
Got any idea where I should put this trap?

212
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:08,625
What? Okay.

213
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:34,568
Watch and weep, you furry fucker.

214
00:23:16,897 --> 00:23:17,898
Your tie.

215
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:32,704
I'm expecting him,
but he isn't back from lunch yet.

216
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:37,584
Just a sec. It's your wife.

217
00:23:37,668 --> 00:23:39,211
I'll call her later.

218
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:50,514
Just to remind you
that you have Eliot's dinner...

219
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:52,599
with the L.A. bank manager at 8:00.

220
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:55,727
Mr. Thompson.
Eliot wants you to be there, too.

221
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:59,731
I know, Bart. You told me yesterday.
Don't forget to call Meg.

222
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:04,444
This is:
"Seattle Revamping Procedure, 61 and 76."

223
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:07,281
It never ends, does it?

224
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:18,458
Thank you.

225
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:20,794
Lost your olive, Bart?

226
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:22,379
Excellent.

227
00:24:22,588 --> 00:24:25,132
Drink up.
You really picked yourself up a prize.

228
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:29,636
What are your plans?
What are you going to do?

229
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:33,098
I'm going to bring in the Orientals.

230
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:38,145
That's how I'll start, bring in the Orientals.
They're great profit people.

231
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,481
You know what I mean?

232
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:47,029
He's Eliot's wastebasket.
Gets all the shit jobs.

233
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:50,741
- Could I have a Scotch?
- You'd sell your kids for the break he got.

234
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:53,619
I don't need an incentive for that,
just an offer.

235
00:24:53,702 --> 00:24:54,870
I'll have a Scotch, too.

236
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:56,830
The point is that Bart...

237
00:24:56,914 --> 00:25:00,918
in his generosity, would like me to think
that he lets me win at tennis.

238
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,170
Right, sport?

239
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,346
- I'm sorry.
- A little distracted?

240
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:15,057
Just picking through the bones. Eliot.

241
00:25:20,771 --> 00:25:24,149
- Enjoying your stay in New York?
- I'm always happy to be here.

242
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:29,488
You did good work with
the Pyramid people on that grain deal.

243
00:25:31,073 --> 00:25:34,868
Did you know that over one-fifth
of all the grain on this planet...

244
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:36,537
is destroyed by rats?

245
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:40,707
That's more than
drought, flood, or even insects destroy.

246
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:42,709
- Did you know that?
- No, I didn't.

247
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:46,880
That's over 5 billion pounds of food
alone in this country.

248
00:25:47,923 --> 00:25:50,467
Can you imagine how many mouths
that would feed?

249
00:25:51,385 --> 00:25:55,264
Not to mention the possible fiscal loss
it must mean to a company like this?

250
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:57,933
- No, I can't.
- Yes, it's extraordinary.

251
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:01,770
In the 14th century,
the rat carried the bubonic plague flea...

252
00:26:01,854 --> 00:26:05,107
that killed every one out of three people
from India to Iceland.

253
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:10,070
It's true. Can you believe that?
The most horrible catastrophe in history.

254
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:14,658
Over one-third of the entire population
of the civilized world destroyed by rats.

255
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:16,910
Not bombs, not guns, but rats.

256
00:26:17,578 --> 00:26:21,915
Your average rat can wriggle
through a hole no bigger than a quarter...

257
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:24,960
swim half a mile
and tread water for three days.

258
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:27,921
They can eat through lead and concrete...

259
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:31,675
with teeth that are like chisels
that exert an unbelievable...

260
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:35,012
24,000 pounds per square inch per tooth.

261
00:26:36,305 --> 00:26:40,309
They can survive being flushed down
a toilet and enter by the same route.

262
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:43,770
They can fall five stories down
to the ground and run off unharmed.

263
00:26:43,854 --> 00:26:48,400
And two rats will give you
20 million rats in less than three years.

264
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:52,779
They say there are as many rats
on this planet now as people.

265
00:26:57,284 --> 00:26:59,453
In this country,
we kill them to get rid of them.

266
00:26:59,536 --> 00:27:03,790
In some countries, like the Philippines,
they kill them because they have to.

267
00:27:03,957 --> 00:27:05,125
To eat them.

268
00:27:05,626 --> 00:27:07,461
Because that's all there is.

269
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:09,087
Stringy chicken.

270
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:12,883
That's what they say it tastes like.

271
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:17,429
And in some country, I don't know
which one, they serve it as a delicacy...

272
00:27:17,846 --> 00:27:21,350
like chocolate-covered bees... or caviar.

273
00:27:24,144 --> 00:27:26,146
A filthy rat on fine china.

274
00:27:27,189 --> 00:27:29,733
There's no accounting for taste, is there?

275
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:34,112
And in some places in Asia and India,
they actually venerate them.

276
00:27:35,656 --> 00:27:37,074
They worship them.

277
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:39,243
Can you imagine that?

278
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,704
Priests set out bowls of honey and milk...

279
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:46,375
to pamper some animal
whose only contribution...

280
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:48,544
is famine, sickness, and death.

281
00:27:49,878 --> 00:27:51,046
Vermin.

282
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:55,008
It's incredible.

283
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:25,098
"This is the Bug Man. We"'"re out on a call",
but please leave a message.

284
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:30,020
Yes, this is Bart Hughes.
My number is 488-8990.

285
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:33,315
You were recommended to me
by a city councilman.

286
00:29:33,732 --> 00:29:37,069
I'd appreciate it if you'd get back to me
as soon as possible.

287
00:29:37,486 --> 00:29:38,570
Thank you.

288
00:29:40,239 --> 00:29:42,533
When traps don't work,
get an exterminator.

289
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:45,536
I called 10 exterminators.
They don't even call back.

290
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:48,830
They're overbooked.
This city is an open sewer.

291
00:29:49,081 --> 00:29:51,166
The rats are waiting to take over.

292
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:54,586
Interesting thing about rats.
They never stop chewing.

293
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:57,297
They got to grind those teeth
'cause they keep growing.

294
00:29:57,381 --> 00:29:58,715
- I know.
- That's a fact.

295
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,677
They can chew through lead,
concrete, anything.

296
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,472
- I hope it isn't a female.
- Why?

297
00:30:05,973 --> 00:30:07,724
They're twice as vicious.

298
00:30:15,816 --> 00:30:17,985
Here we go. Poisons.

299
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,028
We got two main kinds.

300
00:30:20,654 --> 00:30:22,447
This one thins the blood.

301
00:30:22,865 --> 00:30:25,367
- This one works with water.
- What's the difference?

302
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,703
That'll turn him
into a walking hemorrhage.

303
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:31,206
Wait a minute. I don't want him
to bleed all over my furniture.

304
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:35,586
- How about the water torture?
- Steer clear of him for this one.

305
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:38,797
It'll give him a powerful thirst.
He'll run for water.

306
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:42,384
Keep your toilets closed,
and no water around.

307
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:45,971
He'll aim straight for the sewer
and drink until he bursts.

308
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:47,931
- Pop like a balloon.
- Really?

309
00:30:48,223 --> 00:30:50,392
You watch out. Steer clear of him.

310
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:54,146
You get in his way
and he'll go right through you.

311
00:33:16,205 --> 00:33:17,331
Keep it up.

312
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:21,001
I've got friends in Jersey.

313
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:55,953
All right. That's it!

314
00:33:57,913 --> 00:33:59,373
You son of a bitch!

315
00:34:14,304 --> 00:34:16,598
You're going to kill somebody one day!

316
00:34:17,641 --> 00:34:20,102
I still got the rat. And not only that.

317
00:34:20,185 --> 00:34:23,897
I go into my bathroom in the night,
it comes right out of the toilet at me.

318
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:26,817
For crying out loud! You hear that?
Right out of the toilet!

319
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:31,029
I put out enough poison to kill
the Lower East Side of Manhattan...

320
00:34:31,113 --> 00:34:34,116
and not one nibble! Do you hear that?

321
00:34:35,325 --> 00:34:37,286
Came out of the toilet at you?

322
00:34:37,452 --> 00:34:40,622
Want to know why?
Rats like to go for your private parts.

323
00:34:40,831 --> 00:34:44,293
They like the soft parts of your body.
Your blue eyes.

324
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:47,629
A rat will go through your eyes,
then eat your brain.

325
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:50,632
They're smart. They love eyes and"..."

326
00:34:50,924 --> 00:34:52,634
Great, I'll get contacts.

327
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:55,554
Rats may be smart,
but a guy could be smarter.

328
00:34:55,637 --> 00:34:58,891
You come here, I'll talk to you.
We'll figure something out.

329
00:34:59,016 --> 00:35:01,310
- You read about the subway rats?
- No.

330
00:35:02,603 --> 00:35:06,481
Between 125th Street and Grand Central,
there are armies of rats.

331
00:35:06,565 --> 00:35:09,067
It was in the "Daily News" today.
Six people got bit.

332
00:35:09,151 --> 00:35:10,736
- Six people?
- Six people, man.

333
00:35:10,819 --> 00:35:12,738
- On the subway?
- On the subway.

334
00:35:12,988 --> 00:35:14,615
You're doing something wrong.

335
00:35:14,698 --> 00:35:17,993
Obviously. I put the traps
in the same place. It's always a bust.

336
00:35:18,076 --> 00:35:19,703
What kind of bait did you use?

337
00:35:20,037 --> 00:35:22,331
The sharpest cheddar cheese I could find.

338
00:35:23,332 --> 00:35:25,000
- Lamb chops.
- Lamb chops?

339
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:26,710
- Like dinner.
- That's stupid.

340
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:30,005
- I'm sorry. Should I use Béarnaise?
- Use raw bacon.

341
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:34,009
And switch poisons.
He's probably used to what you're using.

342
00:35:34,092 --> 00:35:36,094
Don't forget the rubber gloves.

343
00:35:36,303 --> 00:35:37,846
What rubber gloves?

344
00:35:38,305 --> 00:35:41,642
- The rubber gloves I told you about.
- You said nothing about them.

345
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:44,269
I definitely mentioned them.
That's very important.

346
00:35:44,353 --> 00:35:47,189
Rats pick up on the human smell,
and that's it, game over.

347
00:35:47,272 --> 00:35:50,609
- lf you won't listen, why am I telling you?
- Fine. Rubber gloves.

348
00:35:51,068 --> 00:35:53,028
Checked the boiler room yet?

349
00:35:54,196 --> 00:35:56,490
I didn't think of it.
I put a trap in the basement.

350
00:35:56,573 --> 00:35:58,367
Haven't been in the boiler room.

351
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,577
My guess is you're gonna find him there.

352
00:36:02,204 --> 00:36:04,873
This is a copy, I need the original.
He's got it.

353
00:36:04,957 --> 00:36:08,377
Keep your pants on. He'll be here now.
I'll have it on your desk today.

354
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,421
I can't do anything about Pyramid
without his signature.

355
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,508
Here he comes now. It's only 9:10.

356
00:36:15,884 --> 00:36:20,138
Hall needs your signature on
the Pyramid power of attorney right away.

357
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:23,433
Quite an excitable boy.

358
00:36:28,647 --> 00:36:30,274
Good day so far, Bart?

359
00:36:41,243 --> 00:36:42,578
Can we all play?

360
00:36:46,665 --> 00:36:50,085
You said nothing about rubber gloves,
you boneheaded fart.

361
00:36:50,169 --> 00:36:53,088
Are you hands soft and nice?
Yes, they are.

362
00:37:00,053 --> 00:37:01,096
Got you!

363
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:08,557
That's real groovy.

364
00:39:10,392 --> 00:39:12,394
I bet that's how you did it.

365
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:49,765
So it's a female.

366
00:40:41,149 --> 00:40:42,776
Think he's going to make it?

367
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:45,654
I always thought he could handle pressure.

368
00:40:46,405 --> 00:40:48,657
Now we can see what he's really made of.

369
00:40:51,076 --> 00:40:52,953
Great game last night.

370
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:56,164
- It was shutout, wasn't it?
- Yeah, I think so.

371
00:40:57,124 --> 00:40:59,001
What do you guys know about hockey?

372
00:41:02,754 --> 00:41:04,089
- Did you see the game?
- No.

373
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:08,468
I read your preliminary memo.

374
00:41:09,511 --> 00:41:13,599
A little unorthodox, to say the least,
but interesting if you can amplify on it.

375
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:16,518
You see, essentially what we're doing...

376
00:41:16,602 --> 00:41:20,230
is closing down bank branches
in retired minority areas.

377
00:41:20,314 --> 00:41:22,649
Yet those people are paying back loans...

378
00:41:22,733 --> 00:41:25,485
faster than some doctors and lawyers
we have lunch with.

379
00:41:26,069 --> 00:41:29,072
You son of a gun.
You're going to stir things up. I like that.

380
00:41:29,156 --> 00:41:31,033
Give it to me in black and white.

381
00:41:32,034 --> 00:41:35,662
But I don't know if you're going to survive
to see your own show.

382
00:41:36,121 --> 00:41:37,956
Are you pacing yourself?

383
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:40,709
It's not as bad as it looks.

384
00:41:42,503 --> 00:41:45,088
I've got some things
that I'm having to deal with.

385
00:41:45,923 --> 00:41:48,759
Something with Meg?
Never mind, it's none of my business.

386
00:41:49,635 --> 00:41:50,886
Just settle it.

387
00:41:51,345 --> 00:41:54,056
I need all your attention.
I don't think I've got it.

388
00:41:54,806 --> 00:41:56,975
I might have to put someone in the wings.

389
00:41:57,392 --> 00:41:58,852
James Hall?

390
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:02,981
I'm still behind you, Bart.

391
00:42:04,233 --> 00:42:06,735
Pacing, that's the key.

392
00:42:10,155 --> 00:42:12,241
Settle whatever's bothering you, kiddo.

393
00:42:32,302 --> 00:42:34,346
Wait here, she'll be right out.

394
00:42:34,429 --> 00:42:36,723
This stuff is a mess.

395
00:42:36,807 --> 00:42:38,559
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

396
00:42:38,684 --> 00:42:41,019
You were going to give me the L.A. stuff.

397
00:42:41,353 --> 00:42:43,021
I must be out of my mind.

398
00:42:43,647 --> 00:42:45,232
Right, come on in.

399
00:42:46,108 --> 00:42:48,235
You'll proofread this stuff tonight...

400
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:50,529
and photostat it tomorrow
before the meeting.

401
00:42:50,612 --> 00:42:52,406
- No problem.
- Great.

402
00:42:56,118 --> 00:42:58,996
Finally I get to see
this gorgeous home of yours.

403
00:42:59,955 --> 00:43:03,208
I'm sorry it's not very clean.
The housekeeper's out of town.

404
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:08,130
Janis told me about this article
in "Architectural Digest..."

405
00:43:08,213 --> 00:43:11,550
about renovated brownstones.
I was thinking maybe you'd be interested.

406
00:43:13,844 --> 00:43:15,888
The third floor's still a mess.

407
00:43:15,971 --> 00:43:18,223
It's very Edgar Allan Poe up there.

408
00:43:18,307 --> 00:43:20,976
It's where the cockroaches
have their birthday parties.

409
00:43:24,438 --> 00:43:26,148
What a floor!

410
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:30,652
This wood must have taken you forever
to strip down.

411
00:43:30,986 --> 00:43:35,449
I did all this by hand myself.
Not one machine touched this floor.

412
00:43:36,742 --> 00:43:39,411
It's gorgeous. And so much room.

413
00:43:42,581 --> 00:43:44,124
Beautiful things.

414
00:43:46,335 --> 00:43:48,837
Your wife must be very happy here.

415
00:43:51,006 --> 00:43:53,467
I don't know.
You should talk to her about that.

416
00:43:56,261 --> 00:43:59,473
Sometimes I think she thinks
she's running second to this place.

417
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,982
What's happening with you?

418
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:16,240
My son, Pete, he's the best.

419
00:44:19,034 --> 00:44:20,911
You don't know him, do you?

420
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,040
He's a killer.

421
00:44:28,335 --> 00:44:29,711
All is not easy.

422
00:44:35,926 --> 00:44:38,720
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry or anything.

423
00:44:56,655 --> 00:44:58,031
What was that?

424
00:44:59,408 --> 00:45:00,826
House sounds.

425
00:45:05,414 --> 00:45:07,791
Come on, I'll walk you to your cab.

426
00:45:22,764 --> 00:45:24,016
There you go.

427
00:45:29,813 --> 00:45:31,273
I'll see you tomorrow.

428
00:45:43,368 --> 00:45:45,037
Here, kitty.

429
00:45:46,038 --> 00:45:49,583
Come here.
Want a job, puddy cat? That's right.

430
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,382
We'll put you to work.
Would you like that?

431
00:45:59,176 --> 00:46:02,638
Where did you get this sweet face?
What have we got in here?

432
00:46:02,721 --> 00:46:04,014
A saucer.

433
00:46:05,307 --> 00:46:08,143
Over here.
Would you like some old ketchup to eat?

434
00:46:08,227 --> 00:46:11,647
Would you like a lime? No? Okay.

435
00:46:12,022 --> 00:46:15,025
How about a cucumber or a banana?
What's in here?

436
00:46:15,734 --> 00:46:17,611
See what we've got in here.

437
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:21,156
Did you know
that I was king of all the pretties?

438
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:25,661
Good, two-week-old oysters.
Want some of those?

439
00:46:28,497 --> 00:46:30,415
I used to have a puddy like you.

440
00:46:30,499 --> 00:46:33,043
But my wife sneezes,
so I can't have one anymore.

441
00:46:40,133 --> 00:46:43,136
Here, you want some rope?
It's top of the line.

442
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:46,390
I don't need rope.
What other kind of lights do you have?

443
00:46:46,473 --> 00:46:48,183
Lights. No hammers.

444
00:46:48,433 --> 00:46:51,436
I got a great light here.
They use this in coal mines.

445
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,398
- It's great. It leaves your hands free.
- How does it work?

446
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:56,483
Put it on your head like this.

447
00:46:56,567 --> 00:46:58,986
You need a hat. Put this on your belt.

448
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:15,794
- I'll take this.
- You need scissors to cut through stuff?

449
00:47:15,878 --> 00:47:19,256
- Those are great gloves. You'll need them.
- No, I don't need scissors.

450
00:47:20,841 --> 00:47:24,094
No, I don't need tennis balls.
I'll just take this.

451
00:47:24,261 --> 00:47:26,430
- You need a gas mask...
- I just need this!

452
00:47:26,513 --> 00:47:29,057
- Just get this!
- Okay, I got it for you.

453
00:48:27,115 --> 00:48:31,286
Now, listen. The major dilemma here...

454
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:34,831
is that this town ain't big enough
for the both of us.

455
00:48:34,915 --> 00:48:38,460
I've been around.
I've been to college. I've been there.

456
00:48:38,877 --> 00:48:41,338
I've tried dope. I've tried these things.

457
00:48:41,421 --> 00:48:43,715
I want you to know
who you're dealing with.

458
00:53:16,697 --> 00:53:17,990
Come on.

459
00:53:42,306 --> 00:53:43,932
You son of a bitch!

460
00:54:42,366 --> 00:54:46,036
You don't understand. This isn't
some ordinary rat I'm dealing with.

461
00:54:46,328 --> 00:54:47,621
It killed my"..."

462
00:54:48,247 --> 00:54:49,581
It killed my cat.

463
00:54:52,876 --> 00:54:54,503
That's very kind of you.

464
00:54:54,586 --> 00:54:57,923
I'll put the house key
under the second step...

465
00:54:58,006 --> 00:54:59,591
in front of the main door.

466
00:55:00,133 --> 00:55:02,553
When you come in,
there's a library to your left.

467
00:55:02,636 --> 00:55:06,014
The check will be under the stereo cover,
on top of the platter.

468
00:55:06,849 --> 00:55:08,141
Thank you very much.

469
00:55:35,043 --> 00:55:36,044
You okay?

470
00:55:42,426 --> 00:55:44,636
Hello? Hi, honey.

471
00:55:46,471 --> 00:55:49,224
Come home, baby. I need you.

472
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:52,227
It's only a few more days.
Can't you live without me?

473
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:53,604
How's Peter?

474
00:55:53,937 --> 00:55:56,607
Fine. He's right here.
He's dying to talk to you.

475
00:55:57,107 --> 00:55:58,192
Hold on.

476
00:55:58,525 --> 00:56:00,402
Peter, it's your daddy.

477
00:56:01,737 --> 00:56:03,864
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, pal.

478
00:56:03,947 --> 00:56:06,241
You having fun
with Grandma and Granddad?

479
00:56:06,325 --> 00:56:08,035
Yeah, come on over, Daddy.

480
00:56:09,912 --> 00:56:12,247
Peter? Hello, Peter?

481
00:56:35,854 --> 00:56:37,940
Darling, I'm home!

482
00:56:46,073 --> 00:56:47,491
But you're not.

483
00:57:33,871 --> 00:57:36,582
- "Modern exterminators."
- This is Hughes!

484
00:57:36,665 --> 00:57:41,211
You came into my house, took my money,
and this thing is still...

485
00:57:41,295 --> 00:57:43,797
"Hold it"! "What money", "you son of a bitch?"

486
00:57:43,881 --> 00:57:46,508
I wasted an hour coming uptown
"for your bullshit check"!

487
00:57:46,592 --> 00:57:48,218
"No money", "no job"!

488
00:58:13,911 --> 00:58:15,287
Liberace, huh?

489
00:58:32,387 --> 00:58:33,805
That's good.

490
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:39,102
That's funny.

491
00:58:41,146 --> 00:58:44,024
Okay, I quit for tonight.

492
00:59:20,394 --> 00:59:23,105
In my bed!

493
00:59:23,355 --> 00:59:25,691
You want a war, I'll give you a war!

494
00:59:25,774 --> 00:59:29,319
And don't tell me I didn't hit you.
I hit you! I did.

495
00:59:48,255 --> 00:59:50,215
"We"'"ll show him what a man can do..."

496
01:02:18,822 --> 01:02:20,240
Go away.

497
01:02:23,202 --> 01:02:25,662
What is it? What's going on?

498
01:02:27,206 --> 01:02:28,540
There was some guy...

499
01:02:28,624 --> 01:02:32,461
an exterminator, trying to reach you.
He called you all kinds of names.

500
01:02:44,181 --> 01:02:45,641
Can I help you?

501
01:02:46,517 --> 01:02:48,018
It's time for you to go.

502
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:19,466
There just ain't enough
hours in the day, Betty.

503
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:07,806
I wondered when you'd get around to that.

504
01:04:09,016 --> 01:04:10,601
That's all right.

505
01:04:14,605 --> 01:04:16,106
I'm ready for you.

506
01:05:07,407 --> 01:05:08,742
Motherfucker!

507
01:06:27,196 --> 01:06:28,614
Thank you, Tom.

508
01:06:43,837 --> 01:06:46,131
Don't let the staff see you like this.

509
01:06:46,215 --> 01:06:50,469
Something's happening at home,
and I'm going to take care of it now.

510
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:54,056
You'll get that report
when I'm finished with it.

511
01:06:54,139 --> 01:06:55,766
It's a matter of priorities.

512
01:06:55,849 --> 01:06:59,937
And if you want to give it to James Hall,
that's your choice.

513
01:07:00,854 --> 01:07:02,731
If you want to stick with me"..."

514
01:07:04,274 --> 01:07:06,610
That's the long and short of it.

515
01:07:11,323 --> 01:07:13,408
Don't let the staff see you like this.

516
01:07:29,341 --> 01:07:31,301
I understand, but"..."

517
01:07:33,136 --> 01:07:37,224
Could you just say her husband called,
and ask her to call me back?

518
01:07:38,642 --> 01:07:39,977
Yes, thank you.

519
01:08:10,174 --> 01:08:11,425
Amazing.

520
01:08:12,509 --> 01:08:14,928
I hope you fried your ass, you tart.

521
01:08:38,285 --> 01:08:41,330
I don't know"..." Where is it?

522
01:08:49,713 --> 01:08:51,715
Did you move it, or what?

523
01:10:50,334 --> 01:10:52,377
Hi, honey, we're home.

524
01:11:08,685 --> 01:11:11,271
I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

525
01:11:13,232 --> 01:11:15,025
I don't know anymore.

526
01:11:20,531 --> 01:11:22,241
Where have you been?

527
01:12:46,867 --> 01:12:49,494
Operator, there must be some mistake.

528
01:12:50,037 --> 01:12:51,997
Can we try again, please?

529
01:12:58,295 --> 01:13:00,339
Could you try one more time?

530
01:13:20,526 --> 01:13:22,027
Thank you, operator.

531
01:14:27,217 --> 01:14:30,596
I've been trying to call Bart.
Something's wrong with his phone.

532
01:14:30,721 --> 01:14:33,849
- lf it's about his Chicago file...
- It is.

533
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:37,102
There's been a little change
in our timetable.

534
01:14:37,186 --> 01:14:41,398
The Board meeting has been postponed.
Chicago and Detroit can't make it.

535
01:14:41,815 --> 01:14:43,775
I'm pushing it back two weeks.

536
01:14:44,359 --> 01:14:46,945
I'm sure Bart can use the extra time.

537
01:14:47,112 --> 01:14:48,614
I'm sure he can.

538
01:14:49,781 --> 01:14:51,283
Thanks, Eliot.

539
01:15:26,693 --> 01:15:28,237
Bart, can you hear me?

540
01:15:30,781 --> 01:15:33,116
Bart, are you there? Can you hear me?

541
01:15:33,825 --> 01:15:37,538
Listen to me. Everything's gonna be okay.

542
01:15:37,621 --> 01:15:40,040
Eliot's given us another two weeks!

543
01:15:42,835 --> 01:15:45,504
Leave us alone!

544
01:20:15,065 --> 01:20:16,733
Come on down!

545
01:24:30,195 --> 01:24:31,572
Good!

546
01:25:39,890 --> 01:25:41,683
Honey, what are you wearing?

547
01:25:42,643 --> 01:25:43,936
You're all wet.

548
01:25:49,024 --> 01:25:50,692
Look at you. You're soaking wet!

549
01:25:50,776 --> 01:25:53,070
- Who is this?
- I missed you, Daddy.

550
01:25:54,738 --> 01:25:56,573
- Let me rub your beard.
- Rub my beard.

551
01:25:56,657 --> 01:25:58,367
- You'll catch cold.
- Who's my best pal?

552
01:25:58,450 --> 01:26:00,035
- I am.
- That's right.

553
01:26:02,204 --> 01:26:03,497
Missed you.

554
01:26:04,414 --> 01:26:06,792
- The luggage.
- Fuck the luggage.

555
01:26:15,843 --> 01:26:20,264
- Oh, my God! What happened here?
- I had a party.
