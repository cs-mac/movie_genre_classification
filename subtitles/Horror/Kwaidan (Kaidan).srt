17
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,276
<i>In old Kyoto there was</i>
<i>a young samurai</i>

18
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,149
<i>who had been reduced to poverty</i>
<i>by the ruin of his lord</i>.

19
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,669
<i>He decided to leave his home</i>

20
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,593
<i>and take service with the</i>
<i>governor of a distant province</i>.

21
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,869
Goodbye.

22
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,271
Stay well. I can't live here
with you. I have a future.

23
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,754
For men, advancement is the
most important.

24
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,829
I can't give it up
just because of you.

25
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,234
I can't bury my future here.

26
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,672
Must you leave Kyoto?

27
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,589
I'll work harder than before.
I'll weave day and night.

28
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,716
I'll slave for a better living.

29
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,276
If I lose this chance,
I'll be finished.

30
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,639
Don't try to stop me. The new
post will bring me fortune.

31
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,680
If you can remarry a man
of some distinction,

32
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,512
you'll have fortune too.

33
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,359
There's nothing more to say.

34
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,076
I've had enough of poverty!

35
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,238
You're going to leave
early in the morning.

36
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,711
So you better go to bed now.

37
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,512
Take her to the bridal chamber.

38
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,557
My daughter is finally married.

39
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,871
I feel relieved now.

40
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,077
I'm glad to have you
in my family.

41
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,193
Thank you.

42
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,070
He knows his obligation.
He'll serve her well.

43
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,230
Please, take care of my daughter.

44
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,790
Yes.

45
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,558
<i>The samurai could not understand</i>
<i>the value of love</i>.

46
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,832
<i>He divorced his good wife</i>

47
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,751
<i>and married the daughter of</i>
<i>a noted family to gain position</i>.

48
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,877
<i>And he took her</i>
<i>to his new post</i>.

49
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,753
<i>It was the thoughtlessness</i>
<i>of youth</i>

50
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,036
<i>and the experience of desire</i>.

51
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,994
<i>His second marriage did not</i>
<i>prove a happy one</i>.

52
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,510
<i>His new wife was selfish</i>
<i>and callous</i>.

53
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,595
<i>He soon found every cause to</i>
<i>recall with regret his Kyoto days</i>.

54
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,754
<i>Then he discovered he still loved</i>
<i>his first wife</i> - 

55
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,597
<i>loved her more than he could</i>
<i>ever love his second</i>.

56
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,915
<i>And he began to realise</i>
<i>how unfair</i>

57
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,190
<i>and how ungrateful</i>
<i>he had been</i>.

58
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,276
<i>Memories of a woman</i>
<i>he had wronged</i> - 

59
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,954
<i>her gentle speech,</i>

60
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,835
<i>her smile,</i>

61
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,557
<i>her pretty dainty ways,</i>

62
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,235
<i>her impeccable patience</i>...

63
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,990
...<i>continuously haunted him</i>.

64
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,629
I quit!

65
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,798
The same old game!

66
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,872
I'm tired of it!

67
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,949
Girls, you're dismissed.

68
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,591
You better go to bed now.

69
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,956
Your husband is still reading.

70
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,990
How ungrateful you are!

71
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,152
You've gained position because of
my family's social prestige.

72
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,032
You only used me.

73
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,638
You're always cherishing your
old memories.

74
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,159
You're walking out on me!

75
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,236
The dew won't help.

76
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,595
Please, go to your bedroom

77
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,558
and nurse her ladyship.

78
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,870
Nurse her? That's your duty.

79
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,073
Don't say that.

80
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,393
She may return to her parents
tomorrow if she wants to.

81
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,316
I can't stand seeing her
dissatisfied look any more.

82
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,668
Tell her so.

83
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,511
After all, I was young
and thoughtless.

84
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,190
I'll find my ex-wife
whom I deserted

85
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,674
and make amends
for my sinful act.

86
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,357
<i>The years went by</i>.

87
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,350
<i>And his official term expired</i>.

88
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,155
<i>It was September 10th when he</i>
<i>reached the street of Kyoto</i>

89
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,918
<i>where his first wife</i>
<i>used to live</i>.

90
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,832
<i>It was midnight and the city was</i>
<i>as silent as a cemetery</i>.

91
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,197
When did you come back to Kyoto?

92
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:08,715
Now. Just now.

93
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:19,397
How did you find your way to me,
through all those black rooms?

94
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,033
Stay seated.

95
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,349
Don't bother.

96
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,149
I'll get supper.

97
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,713
I don't want it.

98
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,552
You haven't changed a bit.

99
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,031
You look just like you did before.

100
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,039
Your face that I couldn't
forget for a moment...

101
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,031
and your voice that was
so dear to me!

102
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,708
Forgive me.

103
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:01,712
I was cruel. I was a fool.

104
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,996
I deserve your hatred.

105
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,359
Until the day my official
term expired,

106
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,908
how I longed to come back to you!

107
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,160
How deeply I regretted
my selfishness!

108
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,558
How wretched I was without you!

109
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,272
How I loathed myself
for divorcing you!

110
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,675
How long I've hoped and planned
to make amends!

111
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,836
As soon as I became free.

112
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,829
I wanted to come back to Kyoto
and find you.

113
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,394
I hurried here in the dark.

114
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,279
It's very kind of you

115
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,390
thinking about me so much.

116
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,639
Forgive me.

117
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,639
Please forgive me.

118
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,557
I was such a fool!

119
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,551
Don't reproach yourself.

120
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,996
It's wrong to allow yourself
to suffer on my account.

121
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:24,432
I always felt that I wasn't
worthy of being your wife.

122
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,989
Don't...

123
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,672
I knew that, but I couldn't help
trying to be near you.

124
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,114
Anyway, it was very cruel of me
to have divorced you.

125
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:41,029
It was because of poverty.

126
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:51,191
While you lived with me,
you were always kind.

127
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,552
Why should I think ill of you?

128
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,712
I prayed for your good fortune
every day and night.

129
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,878
I'll make amends.

130
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,472
Forget it.
You came a long way home.

131
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,308
What greater happiness
than to see you again...

132
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:41,156
even if only for a moment?

133
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,037
Only for a moment!

134
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,996
Make it the length of
seven lifetimes!

135
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,559
Unless you forbid it,

136
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,277
I'll live with you always...
always!

137
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,999
Nothing shall ever
separate us again.

138
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:18,633
Your fragrant hair!
It's the same as before.

139
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,719
The same glossy hair...

140
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,758
dark eyes...

141
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,592
Iovely nose...

142
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,433
soft cheeks...

143
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,914
and...

144
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:36,678
I've forgotten my sorrow.

145
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,590
Many things have happened
in Kyoto since you went away.

146
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,639
I imagine so.

147
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,155
I can't tell you everything
in a night.

148
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:03,719
Soon it'll be dawn.

149
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,709
Yes. This room is very dear to me.

150
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,359
It was our bridal chamber.

151
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,920
We spent several nights here.

152
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,233
I don't want to sleep now.

153
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:44,195
I want to talk of the past and the
present and the future with you

154
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,313
and feel as happy as I am now.

155
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,269
I also feel as if
this were a dream.

156
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,155
I don't want to sleep
for a moment

157
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,433
so I can keep you forever.

158
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:29,792
THE WOMAN OF THE SNOW

159
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,997
<i>In a village of Musashi Province</i>

160
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,749
<i>there lived two woodcutters:</i>
<i>Mosaku and Minokichi</i>.

161
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,838
<i>Mosaku was an old man</i>

00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:53,917
<i>and Minokichi, his apprentice,</i>
<i>was a boy of eighteen</i>.

163
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,113
<i>Everyday, they went to a forest</i>
<i>a few miles away</i>

164
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,873
<i>from the village</i>.

165
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,596
<i>One cold day, a great snowstorm</i>
<i>overtook them on their way home</i>.

166
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:36,195
<i>The boatman had left his boat</i>
<i>on the other side of the river</i>.

167
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,833
<i>It was no day for swimming</i>.

168
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:45,670
I intended to treat you like
the other man.

169
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:52,435
But I couldn't help feeling pity
for you

170
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,948
because you're so young.

171
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,959
You're a handsome boy.

172
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,717
I will not hurt you now.

173
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:22,954
But if you ever tell anybody -
even your own mother

174
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,637
about what you've seen tonight,
I'll know it.

175
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:31,588
And then I'll kill you.

176
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:42,350
Remember that.

177
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,473
Understand?

178
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,555
I'll be going now.

179
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:25,318
We sell wood for a living.

180
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:35,957
You can't work for some time,
not before spring.

181
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:42,109
The terrible cold night
made you ill.

182
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,275
Eat the porridge.

183
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:57,113
Take care of yourself, son.

184
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,794
Or you'll be frozen

185
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:05,030
and dead like that old Mosaku

186
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,274
whose blood was all gone.

187
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,435
If this happens to you again,

188
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,469
you won't survive.

189
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,992
Are you listening?

190
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:33,632
You've said nothing
about that night.

191
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,433
<i>A year passed</i>.

192
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,876
<i>As soon as he got well,</i>
<i>he resumed working</i>.

193
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:13,040
<i>Every morning, he went</i>
<i>to the forest alone</i>

194
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,235
<i>and returned with bundles</i>
<i>of wood after sunset</i>.

195
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,672
Where are you going
in the evening?

196
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,035
Edo.

197
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:44,909
Now?

198
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,350
Yes.

199
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,391
I lost my parents.

200
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:07,269
My relatives in Edo might help me
find work as a servant.

201
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:10,035
Brothers?

202
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,589
None?

203
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,470
You'd need connections

204
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:25,274
to find work in Edo.

205
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,389
Is it so hard to get work

206
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:31,990
when you don't know anyone?

207
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:36,111
You could get married...

208
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,115
With you?

209
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,554
Come!

210
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,034
That's my house.

211
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,313
Why don't you take a rest?

212
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,357
There's nobody you have to mind.

213
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:15,476
But...

214
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:21,232
Only my mother and I live there.
Come!

215
00:57:54,080 --> 00:58:00,110
Your name is Yuki?
I see, I see.

216
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:12,037
Going to Edo alone

217
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:17,358
sounds very dangerous.

218
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:25,916
People are not always kind.

219
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:31,910
Young girls must be careful

220
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:38,635
not to be bothered by bad men.

221
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:57,990
Come eat while it's hot.

222
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,956
<i>And Yuki bore him</i>
<i>three children,</i>

223
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,356
<i>handsome and very fair of skin</i>.

224
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,951
<i>She acquired a fame for being a</i>
<i>good wife among the villagers</i>.

225
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,789
Take a moment to reflect
on Grandma's grave.

226
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:17,514
Show her you've grown up.

227
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,952
Give her your flowers.

228
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:46,077
It seems she never gets old.

229
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,679
Really.

230
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:52,477
She's as young today as on the day
she first came into the village.

231
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,837
She's a wonder.

232
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,352
Were you at the grave?

233
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:06,912
Yes. It's my mother-in-law's
memorial day.

234
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,389
That's good.

235
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:13,153
She must be pleased to see her
nice grandchildren

236
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,357
praying for her.

237
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:16,908
She's happy.

238
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:20,757
She died praising
her son's wife.

239
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:24,917
It's not very common.

240
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:26,475
No.

241
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,551
Usually, a mother-in-law talks ill
of her son's wife.

242
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,155
No matter how good the wife is.

243
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:32,389
That's not true.

244
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,918
Thanks to you, I'm happy.

245
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:41,273
What a happy couple,
you and your husband!

246
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,472
He must be happy.

247
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:47,952
He has such a good and beautiful
woman for a wife.

248
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,355
Naturally.

249
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:00,030
What a young wife!

250
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:03,109
Most peasant women age early

251
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:06,511
after having three children.

252
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:09,076
She still looks like a girl.

253
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,199
She's a wonder.

254
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,838
Put them on.

255
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:54,759
Is it too small?

256
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:58,354
And the children's?

257
01:04:58,520 --> 01:04:59,748
I made them.

258
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:17,749
How nice! All ready... the sandals
for the holiday season!

259
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,990
If the thongs are too tight,
I'll fix them.

260
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:22,919
Now try them on.

261
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,275
Yes.

262
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:32,273
How beautiful!
Why the red thongs?

263
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,199
You're still young.

264
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:36,237
I'm a mother of three children.

265
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,357
Red is still your colour.

266
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,157
Your feet look beautiful.

267
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:06,512
It fits well.

268
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:10,078
Not too tight, not too lose.

269
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,950
It's exactly my size.

270
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:17,117
Your sandals look beautiful
and sturdy

271
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:21,393
so people come to you
for special orders.

272
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:25,120
This pair is exceedingly good.

273
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:29,154
I made them so that
they'll match your kimono.

274
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,475
As if I were going away
on a journey!

275
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:41,275
I can't buy you a new kimono,
so at least you have sandals.

276
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:49,359
With your sandals and my kimono

277
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:52,508
our children will have
a wonderful holiday.

278
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:55,919
How is it going?

279
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:00,155
A few more stitches.

280
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:10,830
Why are you watching me
so intently?

281
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:24,031
I just remembered
that night ten years ago.

282
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:29,114
It's strange to recall it now
after so many years.

283
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,960
You're sewing with the light
on your face

284
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:34,713
and I'm looking up at you
like this.

285
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,070
That's why I remembered
that night...

286
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,393
What night?

287
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:48,273
A strange thing happened
that night.

288
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:51,800
I can remember it well as if it
happened yesterday.

289
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:59,238
I was eighteen then. I never
told anybody about that night.

290
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:03,756
I'm not sure it was real
or a dream.

291
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:11,351
It was the night that old Mosaku
was frozen dead

292
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:14,154
as if his blood were all gone.

293
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:22,836
I saw with my own eyes a woman
who was bending over him.

294
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:30,437
And she was blowing her breath
like a white smoke upon him.

295
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:35,152
Then he became stiff and
couldn't move.

296
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:41,714
That woman stooped over me, too.

297
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,877
And I got almost numb.

298
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:48,878
Then,

299
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:52,793
the eyes of the horrible woman

300
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:59,190
looked very, very beautiful.

301
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:01,870
She was so beautiful

302
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:06,635
and white like you.

303
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,273
Yes!

304
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:15,393
You looked exactly like her
just now.

305
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,431
That's why I remembered.

306
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:27,390
Once the memory haunted me
day and night.

307
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,909
I became sick after that.

308
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:42,877
I tell you, it was when I spent

309
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,748
the terrible snowstormy night
in the ferryman's hut.

310
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:49,635
I saw very clearly the weird
woman who killed old Mosaku.

311
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:58,356
I've never seen in my life
a woman as beautiful and white

312
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:00,556
as her except you.

313
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:05,434
Of course, she's not a human
being and I was afraid of her.

314
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:11,679
She was the Woman of the Snow
who was hungry for warm blood...

315
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:15,200
...or a dream.

316
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:16,030
...or a dream.

317
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:22,513
Not a dream.

318
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:46,948
I...

319
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,592
It was me.

320
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,273
Me!

321
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,078
Me!

322
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:12,034
It was Yuki.

323
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:21,159
You promised that night you'd
never tell anybody.

324
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:25,559
You finally broke the promise.

325
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:31,313
It was a pledge for life
for both of us.

326
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:36,993
I told you if you broke it,
I would kill you.

327
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:10,271
You betrayed me!

328
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:20,793
Ah, if it were not for those
children asleep there

329
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:27,068
I would kill you this moment!

330
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:51,196
From now on

331
01:14:54,040 --> 01:15:00,479
you'd better take good care
of those children.

332
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:52,998
If they have any reason to
complain about you

333
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:58,594
I'll treat you as you deserve!

334
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:13,631
Intermission

335
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:58,872
HOICHI, THE EARLESS

336
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:27,353
The time had come.

337
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:33,198
It was dawn on March 24th

338
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:38,156
in Year 1 of the Genryaku era (1185)

339
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:43,193
The armies of the Genji
and Heiké clans were determined

340
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:47,632
to fight one last time at Dan-no-ura,
off Kyushu

341
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:56,558
in the Shimonoséki Strait.

342
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:17,919
Procurator Kanzo from Kumano

343
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:23,029
had hoisted the Kongo-Doji flag

344
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:31,631
and placed on the frontline

345
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:37,358
the boats belonging to Kawanano Michinobu,
inhabitant of the Province of Lyo.

346
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:43,915
He'd decided to side with the Genji

347
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:54,038
with his warriors, on board
two hundred ships.

347
01:22:01,678 --> 01:22:07,708
The Genji and their allies thus
created a mighty navy

348
01:22:09,358 --> 01:22:13,556
comprising of three thousand warships

349
01:22:15,238 --> 01:22:19,470
with the aim of encircling the Haiké navy.

350
01:22:20,478 --> 01:22:26,474
The Genji an Heiké couldn't wait
for the hostilities to start.

351
01:22:28,238 --> 01:22:33,187
Both armies flung themseves at each other.

352
01:22:33,938 --> 01:22:37,495
It is a well-known fact that the Genji army
had been put under the high command

353
01:22:38,578 --> 01:22:48,575
of General Yoshitsuné from Genji.

354
01:22:55,538 --> 01:22:58,257
<i>At Dan-no-ura of</i>
<i>Shimonoseki Channel</i>

355
01:22:59,378 --> 01:23:03,929
<i>the last battle was fought between</i>
<i>the Genji and the Heike clans</i>.

356
01:23:06,578 --> 01:23:12,574
<i>The Heike were defeated in many</i>
<i>battles and escaped to the west</i>.

357
01:23:13,738 --> 01:23:18,448
<i>And here, the clan perished</i>
<i>with the infant emperor</i>.

358
01:24:32,778 --> 01:24:47,728
<i>Notonokami Noritsune knew</i>
<i>this was his last day</i>.

359
01:24:48,898 --> 01:24:55,246
<i>The Genji samurai</i>
<i>were no match for him</i>.

360
01:24:55,498 --> 01:25:02,131
<i>He wanted to cross swords with</i>
<i>Yoshitsune, the Genji commander</i>.

361
01:25:02,698 --> 01:25:10,730
<i>"Come on, Yoshitsune!"he called</i>.

362
01:27:14,738 --> 01:27:22,816
<i>The high waves prevented them</i>
<i>from landing the shore</i>.

363
01:27:23,218 --> 01:27:30,329
<i>And the Genji ships blocked the</i>
<i>one possible escape to the sea</i>.

364
01:27:30,698 --> 01:27:35,214
<i>They waited with arrows</i>
<i>in their bows</i>.

365
01:27:35,618 --> 01:27:40,817
<i>The crew were all dead</i>

366
01:27:41,378 --> 01:27:46,611
<i>and the Heike ships had</i>
<i>no where to go</i>.

367
01:27:46,978 --> 01:27:58,697
<i>Some sank, some went adrift</i>.

368
01:27:59,578 --> 01:28:16,929
<i>The long contest between</i>
<i>the two samurai clans</i>

369
01:28:17,578 --> 01:28:22,333
<i>was reaching its end</i>.

370
01:28:54,938 --> 01:29:12,528
<i>Lady Nii saw the end</i>
<i>of the battle</i>.

371
01:29:14,858 --> 01:29:22,856
<i>She held the infant emperor</i>
<i>in her arms</i>.

372
01:29:23,658 --> 01:29:38,926
<i>"Woman though I am, I won't let</i>
<i>my enemy kill me</i>.

373
01:29:40,058 --> 01:29:51,492
<i>I'll escort His Majesty</i>
<i>to the next world</i>.

374
01:29:51,698 --> 01:29:57,648
<i>If you have loyalty, follow me."</i>

375
01:31:11,978 --> 01:31:15,288
<i>have been haunted for</i>
<i>seven hundred years</i>.

376
01:31:16,618 --> 01:31:20,247
<i>Thousands of strange crabs</i>

377
01:31:22,458 --> 01:31:25,689
<i>called Heike crabs</i>

378
01:31:25,938 --> 01:31:27,815
<i>which have human faces</i>

379
01:31:28,418 --> 01:31:32,047
<i>on their backs are found there</i>.

380
01:31:36,658 --> 01:31:38,694
<i>After Amidaji temple was built</i>
<i>at Akamagahara</i>

381
01:31:38,938 --> 01:31:41,133
<i>to console the dead</i>
<i>samurai's souls</i>

382
01:31:47,658 --> 01:31:50,775
<i>many strange things took place</i>.

383
01:32:11,898 --> 01:32:13,126
Hoichi!

384
01:32:16,938 --> 01:32:18,257
Hoichi!

385
01:32:29,618 --> 01:32:31,529
Here you are.

386
01:32:31,898 --> 01:32:34,128
Be careful not to fall
into the well, Hoichi.

387
01:32:34,298 --> 01:32:35,128
Yes.

388
01:32:35,738 --> 01:32:38,298
The Priest wants you to take care
while we're away.


389
01:32:38,778 --> 01:32:40,818
We're going to perform a service
at the house

390
01:32:40,853 --> 01:32:42,536
of a dead parishioner.

391
01:32:42,778 --> 01:32:43,608
Yes.

392
01:32:44,698 --> 01:32:45,972
There's a piece of watermelon
for you in the kitchen.

393
01:32:46,218 --> 01:32:47,617
Eat it while it's cold.

394
01:32:48,098 --> 01:32:49,451
Yes. Thank you.

395
01:32:50,018 --> 01:32:51,292
All right.

396
01:33:03,938 --> 01:33:06,247
I told him to take care.

397
01:33:07,258 --> 01:33:09,533
He's new here. I'm afraid.

398
01:33:10,058 --> 01:33:11,855
I think he'll be all right.

399
01:35:09,298 --> 01:35:10,208
Who is it?

400
01:35:27,698 --> 01:35:30,451
Are you back, Priest?

401
01:36:13,978 --> 01:36:18,335
No one would visit here
at this hour of night.

402
01:36:20,858 --> 01:36:22,132
Maybe I only imagined
I heard a sound.

403
01:36:50,538 --> 01:36:51,687
Hoichi!

404
01:37:08,898 --> 01:37:09,967
Hoichi!

405
01:37:12,138 --> 01:37:13,935
Who's calling?

406
01:37:19,538 --> 01:37:21,210
I'm blind.

407
01:37:21,498 --> 01:37:23,773
I've not been living here long.

408
01:37:25,298 --> 01:37:29,450
I thought somebody was in the
garden, but I was not sure.

409
01:37:30,378 --> 01:37:31,891
Pardon me.

410
01:37:32,338 --> 01:37:33,691
Forgive me.

411
01:37:40,098 --> 01:37:41,577
Nothing to fear.

412
01:37:43,578 --> 01:37:45,808
I'm stopping near this temple

413
01:37:46,978 --> 01:37:50,573
and have been sent here
with a message.

414
01:37:53,378 --> 01:37:56,370
My present lord, a person of
exceedingly high rank

415
01:37:56,938 --> 01:38:01,216
is now staying at Akamagahara
with his numerous attendants.

416
01:38:01,738 --> 01:38:04,969
He wanted to view a scene
of the battle of Dan-no-ura

417
01:38:05,218 --> 01:38:06,697
so we went there today.

418
01:38:10,978 --> 01:38:14,653
Now, my lord heard of your skill
in reciting

419
01:38:14,858 --> 01:38:17,008
the story of the battle.

420
01:38:17,578 --> 01:38:20,695
They say you even surpass
your teacher.

421
01:38:21,098 --> 01:38:23,692
So he desires to hear
your performance.

422
01:38:24,538 --> 01:38:29,566
Take your biwa and come with me
to our house at once.

423
01:38:31,138 --> 01:38:33,732
It's very kind of him.

424
01:38:36,538 --> 01:38:38,768
But I'm afraid I'm not
good enough.

425
01:38:39,418 --> 01:38:43,775
You wouldn't disobey his
commands, would you?

426
01:38:49,098 --> 01:38:52,886
I believe your lord is a very
noble person.

427
01:38:53,258 --> 01:38:56,807
Yes. Usually you couldn't be
in his presence.

428
01:38:58,138 --> 01:38:59,651
It's good fortune.

429
01:39:26,578 --> 01:39:28,057
Open the gate!

430
01:40:22,618 --> 01:40:24,529
Someone in there!

431
01:40:25,458 --> 01:40:27,130
I've brought Hoichi!

432
01:40:56,898 --> 01:40:58,251
Take your shoes off now.

433
01:42:02,738 --> 01:42:04,217
Another dead one?

434
01:42:04,738 --> 01:42:06,296
The tide washed him back

435
01:42:16,098 --> 01:42:18,054
Another ghost ship?

436
01:42:18,338 --> 01:42:20,408
I saw wills o' the wisp last night.

437
01:42:34,978 --> 01:42:36,013
Yasaku!

438
01:42:36,978 --> 01:42:38,127
Good morning.

439
01:42:47,538 --> 01:42:48,687
Hoichi?

440
01:42:49,058 --> 01:42:50,616
He isn't in.

441
01:42:51,298 --> 01:42:52,492
Not back yet?

442
01:42:52,738 --> 01:42:53,693
No.

443
01:42:54,098 --> 01:42:58,694
Is it true that none of you knew
when he left last night?

444
01:42:59,018 --> 01:43:03,933
Yes. I thought
he had gone to bed.

445
01:43:27,298 --> 01:43:29,414
Another ship sank last night.

446
01:43:29,818 --> 01:43:30,698
Whose?

447
01:43:30,733 --> 01:43:32,609
Gon-emon's. He went out fishing.

448
01:43:32,818 --> 01:43:35,286
His family came here
to request a service.

449
01:43:36,178 --> 01:43:37,293
Is that so?

450
01:43:37,378 --> 01:43:38,936
I told the Priest.

451
01:43:39,258 --> 01:43:43,012
I see. I'm very sorry.

452
01:43:44,138 --> 01:43:46,698
Does a ghost ship really exist?

453
01:43:46,978 --> 01:43:48,377
It seems so.

454
01:43:48,938 --> 01:43:51,850
I haven't seen it. I wonder if it
really exists. Don't you, Donkai?

455
01:43:52,298 --> 01:43:56,371
It exists only for those
who believe it does.

456
01:43:57,738 --> 01:43:59,888
You make me confused again.

457
01:44:00,138 --> 01:44:01,491
I really believe it.

458
01:44:01,978 --> 01:44:03,258
Don't fool me.

459
01:44:03,293 --> 01:44:05,692
I'm serious. You always...

460
01:44:05,938 --> 01:44:07,212
I'm serious, too.

461
01:44:07,578 --> 01:44:09,136
Is Hoichi back?

462
01:44:09,378 --> 01:44:11,972
Yes. Are you going out?

463
01:44:14,898 --> 01:44:16,650
How is he?

464
01:44:17,458 --> 01:44:20,097
It seems he's sleeping
in his room.

465
01:44:20,378 --> 01:44:22,334
What? When did he...?

466
01:44:23,258 --> 01:44:24,896
None of us knows when
he came back.

467
01:44:25,938 --> 01:44:27,007
I see.

468
01:44:32,338 --> 01:44:34,533
He must have had
a pleasant night.

469
01:44:34,898 --> 01:44:36,968
I told him to take care
of the house.

470
01:44:37,458 --> 01:44:39,050
What an untrustworthy fellow!

471
01:44:39,658 --> 01:44:44,015
Well, I must get ready
for a service for Gon-emon.

472
01:44:44,818 --> 01:44:46,934
We'll have another wake tonight.

473
01:44:48,898 --> 01:44:50,729
It'll be hot today.

474
01:45:54,498 --> 01:45:58,332
How I was scared! You're sitting
in the dark like that.

475
01:45:58,978 --> 01:46:00,411
I wondered who it was.

476
01:46:01,658 --> 01:46:03,057
What's the matter?

477
01:46:03,538 --> 01:46:05,176
"What's the matter?"

478
01:46:05,578 --> 01:46:10,129
Everybody's out. Matsuzo went
home today, so I'm alone.

479
01:46:10,378 --> 01:46:12,448
And I thought you were asleep.

480
01:46:12,658 --> 01:46:14,455
I took you for a ghost.

481
01:46:15,098 --> 01:46:17,453
Oh, I got soaking wet.

482
01:46:18,618 --> 01:46:20,176
I'm so sorry.

483
01:46:20,898 --> 01:46:24,288
That's all right. You didn't
eat your breakfast yet.

484
01:46:26,938 --> 01:46:29,736
Where on earth were you
last night?

485
01:46:31,858 --> 01:46:36,932
Your breakfast is ready here.
It hasn't gone bad.

486
01:46:37,178 --> 01:46:38,293
Now eat it.

487
01:46:39,578 --> 01:46:42,092
The boiled eggplants for supper
are there too.

488
01:46:42,458 --> 01:46:43,857
Thank you.

489
01:46:54,978 --> 01:46:59,608
Donkai and the Priest were very
anxious about you.

490
01:47:00,618 --> 01:47:03,894
Where did you go and what
did you do?

491
01:47:04,098 --> 01:47:06,054
Were they that anxious?

492
01:47:06,298 --> 01:47:08,812
You should have known that.
"That anxious"?

493
01:47:09,778 --> 01:47:13,054
You're too young to stay out
all night, aren't you?

494
01:47:13,738 --> 01:47:17,048
So you have a girl now,
is that it?

495
01:47:17,578 --> 01:47:19,375
Of course not.

496
01:47:20,338 --> 01:47:23,171
I went out because I remembered
some business I had to attend.

497
01:47:24,018 --> 01:47:25,167
Really?

498
01:47:27,338 --> 01:47:31,092
Your girl must be blind too.

499
01:47:31,298 --> 01:47:38,374
So you make love groping for
each other like this.

500
01:48:21,338 --> 01:48:22,532
Hoichi!

501
01:48:25,458 --> 01:48:28,973
It's the time we promised.
I've come to take you.

502
01:48:29,298 --> 01:48:30,048
Yes, sir.

503
01:48:33,258 --> 01:48:34,976
You didn't tell anybody?

504
01:48:36,258 --> 01:48:38,294
No, I didn't.

505
01:48:45,898 --> 01:48:47,695
Don't say a word about it.

506
01:48:48,458 --> 01:48:50,733
I understand.

507
01:50:31,498 --> 01:50:32,931
This is very good.

508
01:50:35,898 --> 01:50:40,096
These rice cakes and wine
are all I brought from home.

509
01:50:41,458 --> 01:50:44,336
Give some to Hoichi.

510
01:50:45,298 --> 01:50:46,697
He'll get up soon.

511
01:50:47,578 --> 01:50:50,615
He'll be hungry
when the sun sets.

512
01:50:51,818 --> 01:50:55,254
Oh? What does he do
during the day?

513
01:50:56,978 --> 01:50:58,934
He sleeps like a dead man.

514
01:50:59,218 --> 01:51:01,129
He's very pale.

515
01:51:02,618 --> 01:51:04,938
It's because of the shining
green leaves.

516
01:51:04,673 --> 01:51:05,514
No.

517
01:51:06,918 --> 01:51:08,510
And...

518
01:51:47,238 --> 01:51:48,876
Who's there?

519
01:51:55,318 --> 01:51:57,115
Oh, it's you, Yasaku.

520
01:52:00,758 --> 01:52:02,077
Oh, Matsuzo!

521
01:52:03,078 --> 01:52:04,875
When did you come back?

522
01:52:06,598 --> 01:52:10,796
You were asleep when I came
back so I didn't wake you.

523
01:52:11,558 --> 01:52:13,628
I'm afraid you're sick.

524
01:52:14,078 --> 01:52:14,988
No.

525
01:52:16,358 --> 01:52:20,988
It's this hot climate,
that's all. I'm all right.

526
01:52:39,558 --> 01:52:41,116
Well,

527
01:52:42,118 --> 01:52:46,238
I've been thinking
I must ask you

528
01:52:46,273 --> 01:52:50,117
where you go every night.

529
01:52:50,958 --> 01:52:56,669
Why do you stay out nights, eh?

530
01:52:58,158 --> 01:53:03,027
Tell me the reason why
you leave the temple

531
01:53:04,518 --> 01:53:11,196
every night at so late an hour.

532
01:53:11,678 --> 01:53:16,433
What do you do while you're
away from the temple?

533
01:53:17,798 --> 01:53:21,507
Everybody is suspicious of you.

534
01:53:21,758 --> 01:53:26,786
But I've told them
we could trust you.

535
01:53:28,398 --> 01:53:34,428
At any rate, to go out blind
and alone is dangerous.

536
01:53:35,078 --> 01:53:39,549
I could have had Matsuzo or
Yasaku accompany you.

537
01:53:40,538 --> 01:53:44,736
Where have you been going?

538
01:53:45,418 --> 01:53:47,773
Won't you tell me?

539
01:53:50,738 --> 01:53:52,296
Forgive me.

540
01:53:52,698 --> 01:53:55,087
It's nothing serious.

541
01:53:56,018 --> 01:53:58,737
I remembered some business
I had to do.

542
01:53:59,778 --> 01:54:04,374
So I went out late at night.
I'll be careful from now on.

543
01:54:04,618 --> 01:54:06,290
What is it?

544
01:54:07,378 --> 01:54:09,209
Nothing really.

545
01:54:11,258 --> 01:54:15,615
I'm sorry I worried you.

546
01:54:16,058 --> 01:54:17,286
I see.

547
01:54:53,818 --> 01:54:56,207
Priest!
Priest!

548
01:54:59,218 --> 01:55:02,767
<i>Priest!
Priest!</i>

549
01:55:06,898 --> 01:55:08,411
Yasaku, what happened?

550
01:55:08,818 --> 01:55:09,614
Hoichi...

551
01:55:09,898 --> 01:55:11,297
What's the matter with him?

552
01:55:11,738 --> 01:55:13,456
He went out again just now.

553
01:55:13,818 --> 01:55:19,176
Went out? What are you waiting
for? Follow him immediately!

554
01:55:19,618 --> 01:55:24,328
Go with Matsuzo.
Don't let him find you. Hurry!

555
01:55:33,418 --> 01:55:35,056
Take this. Hurry!

556
01:55:35,218 --> 01:55:36,333
And Matsuzo?

557
01:55:36,578 --> 01:55:38,250
Come on, hurry!

558
01:55:38,498 --> 01:55:39,567
I can't light it.

559
01:55:39,738 --> 01:55:41,217
Better get blind. Then you
wouldn't need light.

560
01:55:41,498 --> 01:55:43,614
- Hurry!
- You go first.

561
01:55:46,498 --> 01:55:47,055
But it's dark.

562
01:55:47,298 --> 01:55:49,414
Of course. Night is never bright.

563
01:55:52,898 --> 01:55:53,967
The thunders!

564
01:55:54,178 --> 01:55:58,057
Never mind! Go now!
Matsuzo!

565
01:56:31,498 --> 01:56:32,533
Yasaku!

566
01:56:32,858 --> 01:56:33,813
Matsuzo!

567
01:56:40,338 --> 01:56:42,772
What are you waiting for?
Go and get him!

568
01:56:52,858 --> 01:56:54,769
Where'd he go?

569
01:56:55,578 --> 01:56:56,806
Over there?

570
01:56:57,098 --> 01:56:59,134
He can't be very far.

571
01:56:59,418 --> 01:57:01,409
Go that way.

572
01:57:03,538 --> 01:57:05,017
Run!

573
01:58:03,538 --> 01:58:04,971
Yasaku!

574
01:58:12,738 --> 01:58:15,377
Yasaku, you must
come with me!

575
01:58:33,418 --> 01:58:34,407
Matsuzo!

576
01:59:36,618 --> 01:59:39,769
His Majesty wants you to be
at home.

577
01:59:40,418 --> 01:59:41,407
Yes, Your Majesty.

578
01:59:44,018 --> 01:59:46,691
You play the biwa beautifully.

579
01:59:48,498 --> 01:59:49,977
And you recite the long
story of Heike

580
01:59:50,218 --> 01:59:53,176
that consists of one hundred
songs every night.

581
01:59:53,418 --> 01:59:56,728
His Majesty is highly pleased.

582
01:59:59,098 --> 02:00:01,931
We're very glad too.

583
02:00:04,858 --> 02:00:07,053
Thank you very much.

584
02:00:07,978 --> 02:00:09,934
As I told you

585
02:00:10,578 --> 02:00:15,094
there are nineteen secret songs
and five secret poems

586
02:00:15,298 --> 02:00:18,847
besides the main story.

587
02:00:21,538 --> 02:00:23,927
It takes many nights to
perform all of them.

588
02:00:24,178 --> 02:00:26,897
I'd like to chant the part
you like most tonight.

589
02:00:32,458 --> 02:00:33,811
He is right.

590
02:00:35,138 --> 02:00:37,015
The battle of Dan-no-ura.

591
02:00:37,898 --> 02:00:41,652
That is the most moving part
of the story.

592
02:00:43,138 --> 02:00:47,131
The chant of the last battle.

593
02:00:47,618 --> 02:00:50,371
Of Dan-no-ura.

594
02:00:57,538 --> 02:01:02,612
Then, Hoichi, chant the battle
of Dan-no-ura.

595
02:01:04,338 --> 02:01:05,453
Certainly.

596
02:03:07,058 --> 02:03:10,448
Let's go home, Matsuzo.

597
02:03:11,578 --> 02:03:12,931
It's terrible.

598
02:03:13,658 --> 02:03:16,297
That kid makes us suffer.

599
02:03:17,258 --> 02:03:18,896
It's unfair.

600
02:03:37,218 --> 02:03:44,852
<i>They shot arrows at each other</i>
<i>for a time</i>

601
02:03:46,098 --> 02:03:50,376
<i>Then the Genji ships moved in</i>
<i>the rapid current</i>

602
02:03:50,658 --> 02:03:58,690
<i>and sailed into the middle of</i>
<i>the Heike ships</i>
603
02:04:32,258 --> 02:04:38,891
<i>The ships of both clans</i>
<i>crossed one another</i>

604
02:04:39,218 --> 02:04:49,498
<i>and covered the surface</i>
<i>of the channel</i>

605
02:04:49,533 --> 02:04:54,413
<i>like dead leaves carpet</i>
<i>the waves of a river</i>

606
02:05:17,658 --> 02:05:33,894
...And then
General Tomomori proclaimed

607
02:05:35,058 --> 02:05:41,247
in front of his assembled soldiers:

608
02:05:42,178 --> 02:05:48,014
Depends upon this battle.

609
02:05:48,938 --> 02:05:54,012
There should be no regrets in life.

610
02:05:56,938 --> 02:06:02,649
Fight like the good men you are!

611
02:06:03,578 --> 02:06:07,537
Think of nothing else!"

612
02:06:08,258 --> 02:06:14,493
"The fate of the Heiké clan

613
02:06:17,018 --> 02:06:27,337
Shouted General Tomomori repeatedly.

614
02:07:50,538 --> 02:08:06,216
<i>"A born emperor you may be",</i>
<i>said Lady Nii,</i>

615
02:08:08,658 --> 02:08:17,817
<i>"your day is done."</i>

616
02:08:20,858 --> 02:08:32,372
<i>The heavens will welcome you,</i>

617
02:08:35,298 --> 02:08:42,807
<i>call the holy name of Buddha</i>

618
02:08:44,338 --> 02:08:55,852
<i>There is a capital beneath the waves</i>
<i>and there you will be crowned</i>

619
02:08:56,058 --> 02:08:59,130
<i>Hoichi!
Hoichi!</i>

620
02:09:08,418 --> 02:09:10,773
<i>Hoichi!</i>

621
02:09:33,938 --> 02:09:42,334
<i>Holding the infant emperor</i>
<i>in her arms</i>

622
02:09:43,098 --> 02:09:51,813
<i>she throws herself into</i>
<i>the deep sea</i>

623
02:09:52,058 --> 02:09:53,377
<i>Hoichi!</i>

624
02:09:53,858 --> 02:09:55,007
<i>Hoichi!</i>

625
02:10:13,098 --> 02:10:14,008
Hoichi!

626
02:10:14,138 --> 02:10:15,856
What are you doing?

627
02:10:16,098 --> 02:10:17,895
Don't interrupt me before
this distinguished assembly!

628
02:10:18,138 --> 02:10:18,888
What are you saying?

629
02:10:19,138 --> 02:10:20,253
You must be mad.

630
02:10:20,498 --> 02:10:21,692
You're bewitched!

631
02:10:22,058 --> 02:10:22,774
Let's go home!

632
02:10:23,138 --> 02:10:26,335
You'll be dead if you stay here.

633
02:10:27,458 --> 02:10:28,329
Let's go.

634
02:10:28,378 --> 02:10:29,857
You'll be punished
if you interfere.

635
02:10:30,098 --> 02:10:31,577
Let go of me!

636
02:10:32,018 --> 02:10:33,690
Listen to us. Come home!

637
02:10:35,138 --> 02:10:36,093
Let go of me!

638
02:10:38,858 --> 02:10:39,654
Leave me alone.

639
02:10:39,898 --> 02:10:41,934
Come home! It's the Priest's order!

640
02:10:44,218 --> 02:10:45,492
Let go of me!

641
02:10:45,738 --> 02:10:46,887
Are you mad?

642
02:10:48,298 --> 02:10:49,208
Let me go!

643
02:11:59,178 --> 02:12:03,808
Why didn't you tell me
this sooner?

644
02:12:05,178 --> 02:12:06,133
Poor boy!

645
02:12:08,898 --> 02:12:13,050
You're now in great danger.

646
02:12:16,338 --> 02:12:18,977
They must have wanted you
because

647
02:12:19,338 --> 02:12:21,613
you have wonderful skills
in music.

648
02:12:22,178 --> 02:12:25,488
You've not been visiting
a house

649
02:12:25,898 --> 02:12:27,729
but a cemetery.

650
02:12:29,778 --> 02:12:33,532
That place is the home
of the spirits

651
02:12:33,778 --> 02:12:35,530
of the Heike samurai.

652
02:12:36,178 --> 02:12:40,171
You've been passing your nights
among tombs.

653
02:12:42,298 --> 02:12:47,895
By this time you must be
aware of that. Understand?

654
02:12:49,458 --> 02:12:53,576
You were sitting before the tomb
of Emperor Antoku last night.

655
02:12:57,298 --> 02:13:03,328
It has all been a vast illusion

656
02:13:04,818 --> 02:13:08,094
except for the calling
of the dead.

657
02:13:08,498 --> 02:13:11,968
Then, it was the spirit of the
dead that came here?

658
02:13:12,218 --> 02:13:17,451
Yes. It was in fact that the
spirit of the dead came.

659
02:13:19,178 --> 02:13:26,732
You have put yourself in
their power.

660
02:13:28,658 --> 02:13:32,571
If you obey them again,

661
02:13:34,098 --> 02:13:37,170
they'll tear you in pieces.

662
02:13:39,658 --> 02:13:45,528
But in any event they'd have
destroyed you sooner or later.

663
02:13:48,298 --> 02:13:53,088
Will the spirit come again
tonight?

664
02:16:34,618 --> 02:16:35,733
Tonight,

665
02:16:36,618 --> 02:16:38,734
as soon as we go away

666
02:16:39,258 --> 02:16:42,728
you must seat yourself
outside and wait.

667
02:16:43,898 --> 02:16:47,607
Then the spirit will call you.

668
02:16:51,098 --> 02:16:56,536
But, whatever may happen,
do not answer.

669
02:16:57,938 --> 02:16:59,212
I understand.

670
02:16:59,378 --> 02:17:01,255
And do not move.

671
02:17:01,578 --> 02:17:03,216
I understand.

672
02:17:03,618 --> 02:17:07,452
Say nothing and sit still

673
02:17:08,778 --> 02:17:11,895
as if meditating.

674
02:17:12,938 --> 02:17:13,768
Yes.

675
02:17:14,298 --> 02:17:15,617
Understood?

676
02:17:17,738 --> 02:17:21,731
Should you move a muscle
or utter a cry,

677
02:17:22,018 --> 02:17:25,374
you will be torn to pieces.

678
02:17:26,298 --> 02:17:30,052
To get rid of the spirits,
you must stay calm

679
02:17:30,338 --> 02:17:33,489
and never call for help.

680
02:17:33,778 --> 02:17:38,090
Even if you call out,
no-one will be able to help you.

681
02:17:38,378 --> 02:17:41,575
You mustn't speak.
Alright?

682
02:17:42,858 --> 02:17:43,768
Yes

683
02:17:44,658 --> 02:17:46,694
If you follow this advice,

684
02:17:46,978 --> 02:17:49,731
there may be hope for you.

685
02:17:52,098 --> 02:17:55,215
I won't move. I won't cry.

686
02:17:56,098 --> 02:17:57,213
Understand?

687
02:17:58,978 --> 02:18:01,651
Whatever may happen?

688
02:18:02,898 --> 02:18:03,853
I won't.

689
02:18:04,818 --> 02:18:08,493
Donkai, you've written
the holy text upon his body?

690
02:18:10,018 --> 02:18:14,648
On his entire body,
from head to toe.

691
02:18:16,298 --> 02:18:17,413
Good.

692
02:19:06,818 --> 02:19:09,457
Help me, Buddha!

693
02:19:47,138 --> 02:19:48,287
Hoichi!

694
02:19:52,618 --> 02:19:53,846
Hoichi!

695
02:20:06,178 --> 02:20:07,975
Hoichi!

696
02:20:15,058 --> 02:20:18,289
No answer? That won't do!

697
02:20:18,938 --> 02:20:22,817
I must see where the fellow is.

698
02:20:58,018 --> 02:21:00,976
Here is the biwa.

699
02:21:08,578 --> 02:21:11,475
But of the biwa player I see...
only two ears!

700
02:21:11,476 --> 02:21:15,097
That explains why
he didn't answer.

701
02:21:25,618 --> 02:21:28,212
He had no mouth to answer with.

702
02:21:28,658 --> 02:21:30,728
There is nothing left of him
but his ears.

703
02:21:34,258 --> 02:21:37,694
This is very strange.

704
02:21:39,018 --> 02:21:40,531
I will take those ears
to my lord

705
02:21:42,058 --> 02:21:46,290
to prove his commands
have been obeyed

706
02:21:46,898 --> 02:21:52,498
as much as it's possible.

707
02:21:52,533 --> 02:21:54,773
It's blood!

708
02:23:29,498 --> 02:23:30,248
Priest!

709
02:23:33,938 --> 02:23:35,007
ウォルマート骨髄！

710
02:23:42,218 --> 02:23:43,856
It leads to the rear gate.

711
02:23:52,738 --> 02:23:53,648
Hoichi!

712
02:23:56,018 --> 02:23:57,337
Hoichi!

713
02:24:00,058 --> 02:24:01,537
Are you there?

714
02:24:02,098 --> 02:24:03,736
Hoichi!

715
02:24:22,978 --> 02:24:25,094
My goodness!

716
02:24:28,778 --> 02:24:29,130
Hurry, clean it!

717
02:24:29,418 --> 02:24:29,895
Yes.

718
02:24:31,818 --> 02:24:33,649
What happened to Hoichi?

719
02:24:37,578 --> 02:24:39,216
His ears were torn off.

720
02:24:39,498 --> 02:24:40,487
What?

721
02:24:40,978 --> 02:24:42,047
His ears?

722
02:25:00,418 --> 02:25:01,851
But why the ears?

723
02:25:02,898 --> 02:25:04,536
Both of them torn off?

724
02:25:04,738 --> 02:25:06,774
- Donkai!
- Yes.

725
02:25:09,458 --> 02:25:11,767
Does the ghost like ears?

726
02:25:15,498 --> 02:25:17,056
He should eat the ears of a
dried cuttlefish instead.

727
02:25:20,938 --> 02:25:23,930
It's our fault.

728
02:25:24,618 --> 02:25:27,178
I thought I wrote everywhere
on his body.

729
02:25:27,818 --> 02:25:31,254
We forgot to write the holy text
on his ears.

730
02:25:31,698 --> 02:25:32,926
I'm sorry.

731
02:25:33,698 --> 02:25:39,489
It's too late.
Ears don't grow again.

732
02:25:43,858 --> 02:25:49,376
It was wrong of me not to make
sure you had done it.

733
02:25:50,218 --> 02:25:52,493
It's my grievous fault.

734
02:25:53,178 --> 02:25:56,488
I never imagined it would
take his ears away.

735
02:25:57,178 --> 02:26:00,090
Well, it can't be helped now.

736
02:26:00,898 --> 02:26:03,731
We can only try to heal
his wounds.

737
02:26:04,138 --> 02:26:05,048
Yes.

738
02:26:07,898 --> 02:26:09,297
But cheer up.

739
02:26:11,498 --> 02:26:16,333
The danger is now over. His ears
were a trade off for his life.

740
02:26:17,338 --> 02:26:20,614
Then, we won't see
those visitors again?

741
02:26:22,258 --> 02:26:24,134
They'll come no more.

742
02:26:35,658 --> 02:26:42,609
We wish to hear the famous
Hoichi-the-Earless play the biwa.

743
02:26:44,498 --> 02:26:48,855
My lord heard of the
strange story.

744
02:26:49,298 --> 02:26:51,573
He will pay Hoichi generously.

745
02:26:51,778 --> 02:26:55,930
By his order, I've come
to take him with me.

746
02:27:13,958 --> 02:27:15,789
- He's here again.
- What?

747
02:27:16,238 --> 02:27:17,671
With attendants!

748
02:28:01,118 --> 02:28:03,473
A noblewoman came also
with her attendants.

749
02:28:03,838 --> 02:28:06,477
I can't tell if they're real.

750
02:28:06,838 --> 02:28:08,908
Maybe the ghost is among them.

751
02:28:12,038 --> 02:28:17,590
Hoichi. You'd better refuse them.
You have so many offers.

752
02:28:20,918 --> 02:28:22,033
No.

753
02:28:22,798 --> 02:28:24,151
I'll play the biwa

754
02:28:26,678 --> 02:28:28,475
as long as I live.

755
02:28:39,078 --> 02:28:44,198
I'll play to console
those sorrowful spirits

756
02:28:45,598 --> 02:28:48,158
and make them rest in peace.

757
02:30:06,998 --> 02:30:13,915
<i>Many noble persons came to the</i>
<i>temple with large gifts of money</i>

758
02:30:14,798 --> 02:30:17,915
<i>so that Hoichi-the-Earless</i>
<i>became a wealthy man</i>

759
02:31:02,078 --> 02:31:04,717
The Year 1900.

760
02:31:07,558 --> 02:31:11,517
<i>Now, in old Japanese books,</i>

761
02:31:11,798 --> 02:31:14,073

<i>Why were they left unfinished?</i>

764
02:31:25,038 --> 02:31:28,314

02:31:29,718 --> 02:31:33,313
<i>Perhaps he had a quarrel</i>

775

777
02:36:33,958 --> 02:36:35,755
You're on duty tonight.

778
02:36:37,958 --> 02:36:40,472
I'll relieve you in the morning.

779
02:36:40,718 --> 02:36:41,434
Yes.

780
02:38:31,518 --> 02:38:36,034
I'm Shikibu Heinai.
I met you today for the first time.

781
02:38:41,958 --> 02:38:45,268
You don't seem to recognise me.

782
02:39:23,198 --> 02:39:25,029
I don't recognise you.

783
02:39:25,598 --> 02:39:30,991
Will you tell me how you gained
entrance to this house?

784
02:39:33,118 --> 02:39:36,428
Ah, you <i>don't</i> recognise me!

785
02:39:36,878 --> 02:39:38,436
No, I don't.

786
02:39:38,838 --> 02:39:42,387
This house is strictly guarded
at all times.

787
02:39:43,158 --> 02:39:45,433
No one can enter unannounced.

788
02:39:47,038 --> 02:39:50,553
I don't understand why you
don't recognise me.

789
02:39:52,758 --> 02:39:55,591
This morning you dared
to wound me!

790
02:41:31,598 --> 02:41:33,350
Intruder!

791
02:41:38,198 --> 02:41:40,314
Come out, everybody!

792
02:41:44,958 --> 02:41:46,277
There's an intruder in the house!

793
02:42:21,358 --> 02:42:29,868
Kannai. No stranger was seen
entering or leaving the house.

794
02:42:30,518 --> 02:42:31,633
But I saw him.

795
02:42:31,918 --> 02:42:36,150
No one in his house has ever heard
of "Shikibu Heinai".

796
02:42:36,478 --> 02:42:37,752
Anyway I thrust him.

797
02:42:38,118 --> 02:42:38,755
To death?

798
02:42:38,998 --> 02:42:40,556
Strangely, no.

799
02:42:41,918 --> 02:42:44,557
We can't even find
a stain of blood.

800
02:42:44,998 --> 02:42:46,113
Kannai!

801
02:42:46,918 --> 02:42:50,433
Well, it sounds strange, but he
went through the wall soundlessly

802
02:42:51,838 --> 02:42:53,066
Through the wall?

803
02:42:54,238 --> 02:42:56,229
Do you mean he vanished
into the wall?

804
02:42:56,838 --> 02:42:57,554
Yes.

805
02:42:58,638 --> 02:42:59,514
Soundlessly?

806
02:42:59,758 --> 02:43:00,747
Yes.

807
02:43:02,718 --> 02:43:05,312
That explains why
we couldn't find him.

808
02:43:06,478 --> 02:43:08,275
After all, he vanished
into the wall.

809
02:43:11,878 --> 02:43:14,028
You're tired,
so you had a nightmare.

810
02:43:15,198 --> 02:43:16,836
No. I'm sure I saw him.

811
02:43:17,318 --> 02:43:18,910
Men! Men!

812
02:43:21,718 --> 02:43:24,630
Men! Where did the intruder go?

813
02:43:24,958 --> 02:43:26,186
Don't you know?

814
02:43:26,718 --> 02:43:28,515
He runs fast!

815
02:44:12,078 --> 02:44:15,434
Will you go to bed, Brother?

816
02:44:16,958 --> 02:44:18,755
It's late.

817
02:44:22,158 --> 02:44:23,989
Umm. How are Mother and Father?

818
02:44:24,958 --> 02:44:26,949
They're asleep now.

819
02:44:31,278 --> 02:44:34,509
Will you tell the servant
to bring wine?

820
02:44:38,718 --> 02:44:41,278
Are you still worried
about last night?

821
02:44:42,318 --> 02:44:45,913
No. I'm off duty tonight.

822
02:44:46,118 --> 02:44:48,109
I want to sleep well.

823
02:45:05,798 --> 02:45:08,471
Sir...

824
02:45:22,638 --> 02:45:24,196
What is it?

825
02:45:24,438 --> 02:45:27,236
We have guests, sir.

826
02:45:27,478 --> 02:45:28,149
What?

827
02:45:30,438 --> 02:45:31,268
Who?

828
02:45:31,798 --> 02:45:32,628
Where?

829
02:45:32,878 --> 02:45:34,072
At the front.

830
02:45:35,718 --> 02:45:37,037
At this hour of night?

831
02:45:39,438 --> 02:45:40,718
What do they want?

832
02:45:40,753 --> 02:45:46,031
Well, a little conversation
with you, sir.

833
02:45:47,558 --> 02:45:49,788
Didn't they give their names?

834
02:45:50,358 --> 02:45:53,668
No. There are three of them.

835
02:46:44,598 --> 02:46:46,554
I'm Kannai.

836
02:46:51,158 --> 02:46:53,513
I'm Matsuoka Bungo.

837
02:46:54,718 --> 02:46:56,549
I'm Dobashi Kyuzo.

838
02:46:58,438 --> 02:47:00,793
I'm Okamura Heiroku.

839
02:47:01,518 --> 02:47:04,078
We're retainers of
Shikibu Heinai.

840
02:47:04,238 --> 02:47:06,593
Shikibu... Heinai!

841
02:47:07,398 --> 02:47:08,114
Yes.

842
02:47:10,078 --> 02:47:12,467
When our master visited you
last night

843
02:47:12,958 --> 02:47:15,267
you struck him with a sword.

844
02:47:16,198 --> 02:47:17,995
He was hurt badly

845
02:47:18,198 --> 02:47:21,508
and went to a hot spring
to tend to his wound.

846
02:47:22,078 --> 02:47:23,636
I sympathise.

847
02:47:25,958 --> 02:47:29,997
But on the 16th day of the
next month he will return.

848
02:47:30,838 --> 02:47:34,592
And he will then repay you
for the injury done to him...

849
02:51:22,078 --> 02:51:23,067
<i>"And</i>...<i>"</i>

850
02:51:25,518 --> 02:51:28,430
<i>Here the old narrative</i>
<i>breaks off</i>.

851
02:51:52,358 --> 02:51:54,508
Well, I didn't see him go out.

852
02:52:18,318 --> 02:52:21,116
He has been writing all day.

853
02:52:21,198 --> 02:52:23,075
I made him hurry.

854
02:52:23,798 --> 02:52:25,197
I'm the publisher.

855
02:52:25,838 --> 02:52:31,390
Oh. I never thought he went out.

856
02:52:31,878 --> 02:52:32,833
Well...

857
02:52:33,918 --> 02:52:36,591
I just dropped in to say
New Year's greetings to him.

858
02:52:36,838 --> 02:52:38,351
- Why don't you come in and wait?
- I will.

859
02:53:06,878 --> 02:53:10,427
<i>I can imagine several
possible endings.</i>

860
02:53:12,158 --> 02:53:15,548
<i>But none of them would
satisfy your imagination.</i>

861
02:53:17,438 --> 02:53:20,555
<i>I prefer to let you attempt
to decide for yourself</i>

862
02:53:21,198 --> 02:53:25,953
<i>the probable consequence
of swallowing a soul.</i>

863
02:53:28,398 --> 02:53:30,832
<i>The man who swallowed a soul...</i>

864
02:55:07,022 --> 02:55:16,022
