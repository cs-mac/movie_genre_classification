{9688}{9798}SORRY, DOCTOR, BUT I'LL WAGER THIS|BOY HAS A TEMPERATURE OF AT LEAST 104.
{9798}{9866}HOW MUCH WOULD YOU|LIKE TO WAGER?
{9866}{9974}HOW ABOUT A WOOL SWEATER? IT GETS|COLD SITTING HERE NAKED ALL THE TIME.
{9974}{10022}IT'S A BET.
{10118}{10187}OH, I'M AFRAID|YOU'RE MISTAKEN.
{10188}{10284}103.2. WOULD YOU LIKE TO LOOK AT IT?
{10292}{10354}IT'S NOT NECESSARY, DOCTOR.|I TRUST YOU.
{10402}{10486}WELL, RICHIE, PIN'S RIGHT|ABOUT ONE THING. IT'S THE FLU.
{10487}{10570}I JUST WANNA DO A LITTLE BLOOD|TEST, SO YOU COME WITH ME.

{10864}{10936}HI, PIN.|HI, PIN.
{11020}{11080}I'M SORRY YOU|DIDN'T WIN THE BET.
{11092}{11198}MAYBE IF YOU JUST ASKED FATHER FOR|SOME CLOTHES, HE'D GIVE SOME TO YOU.
{11206}{11290}IF I WORE CLOTHES, THEN NO ONE|COULD SEE INSIDE ME,
{11302}{11350}AND I WOULDN'T BE ANY GOOD|FOR TEACHING ANYMORE.
{11362}{11470}WELL, COULDN'T YOU TAKE|THEM OFF WHEN YOU HAD TO?
{11470}{11578}I COULDN'T DO IT MYSELF, AND IT WOULD|BE TOO MUCH EXTRA WORK FOR THE DOCTOR.
{11674}{11746}WELL, I COULD COME BY|AND DO IT FOR YOU.
{11747}{11813}YOU HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL.
{11814}{11874}ANYWAY, WE SHOULDN'T BE HAVING|THIS CONVERSATION.
{11886}{11986}YOU KNOW THE DOCTOR DOESN'T LIKE ME|TALKING TO ANYONE WHEN HE'S NOT HERE.
{11998}{12070}WE WON'T TELL HIM.
{12108}{12192}YOU GO OUT TO THE WAITING|ROOM NOW. PIN IS TIRED.
{12204}{12240}BYE, PIN.
{12372}{12466}I'M AFRAID THE BOY HAS|A FEW ROWS ON HIS LEFT LUNG.
{12466}{12532}ARE YOU CONCERNED|ABOUT PNEUMONIA?
{12532}{12597}IT'S CROSSED MY MIND.

{13666}{13726}DO YOU THINK I HAVE NOTHING BETTER|TO DO WITH MY TIME THAN CLEAN UP...
{13736}{13784}AFTER YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS?|I'LL CLEAN IT UP.
{13796}{13844}NEVER MIND.
{13892}{13964}IT'S THAT NEW FRIEND|OF YOURS. THE ALLISON BOY.
{14000}{14094}HE LOOKS DIRTY|AND, UH, DISEASED.
{14106}{14178}I DON'T WANT YOU BRINGING HIM|IN THIS HOUSE AGAIN.
{14179}{14250}WHY DON'T YOU JUST|STERILIZE HIM AT THE DOOR?
{14262}{14310}YOU MADE ME DO THAT, LEON.
{14420}{14502}Y- YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TALKED|TO ME THAT WAY, LEON!
{15030}{15113}THINK FAST!|GEEZ, LEON. WAKE UP.
{15114}{15197}WE'RE HAVING A GAME|AT SCHOOL. WANNA PLAY?
{15198}{15260}HE CAN'T PLAY. HE'LL GET|ALL DIRTY. RIGHT, LEON?
{15264}{15323}WHAT DO YOU SAY?
{15324}{15420}WHAT A SPAZ.|LET'S GO TO SCHOOL.
{17182}{17230}HELLO, PIN.
{17410}{17482}I KNOW THE DOCTOR DOESN'T LIKE ME|TALKING TO YOU WHEN HE'S NOT HERE.
{17494}{17553}COULDN'T I DO IT|JUST THIS ONCE?
{17554}{17626}I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER FRIENDS|TO TALK TO EXCEPT YOU...
{17638}{17734}AND URSULA- BUT SHE'S A GIRL,|SO IT'S NOT THE SAME.
{17734}{17781}YOU GO HOME, MARY.|I'LL LOCK UP.
{17782}{17840}I LEFT A MESS IN THE LAB.|DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
{17841}{17888}I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.
{20466}{20561}NOW, THOSE ARE|HEALTHY LUNGS.
{20562}{20670}ONE IS FROM YOUR MOTHER AND ME,|AND ONE IS FROM PIN.
{20682}{20750}- WHICH ONE'S FROM PIN?|- THE ONE WITH THE BLUE PAPER.
{20762}{20798}LET'S SEE WHAT PIN|GOT YOU.
{21504}{21588}THIS IS JUST THE KIND OF PRESENT|I'D EXPECT FROM PIN.
{21600}{21668}GOSH! WOULD YOU|LOOK AT THIS?
{21668}{21728}DO YOU THINK I'LL EVER|LOOK LIKE THIS?
{21729}{21776}IF YOU GET CAUGHT|WITH THAT-
{21777}{21824}I WON'T.
{21860}{21920}DO YOU THINK MOTHER|LOOKS LIKE THIS?
{21944}{22004}WHERE'D YOU GET THAT THING,|ANYWAY?
{22004}{22076}MARCIA BATEMAN. SHE FOUND|IT IN HER BROTHER'S CLOSET.
{22077}{22125}YOU MEAN SHE STOLE IT.
{22126}{22172}SHE'LL PUT IT BACK.
{22244}{22316}YOU KNOW MARCIA'S ALREADY|GROWING BREASTS?
{22322}{22430}THOSE AREN'T BREASTS.|THAT'S FAT. MARCIA'S A PIG.
{22431}{22490}SHE HAPPENS TO BE|MY FRIEND.
{22491}{22538}YOUR FRIEND'S A PIG.
{22622}{22718}YOU KNOW WHAT I WISH?
{22742}{22802}I WISH PIN COULD COME HERE|AND LIVE WITH US.
{22803}{22862}FATHER WOULDN'T LET HIM.|HE'S AN OFFICE DUMMY-
{22874}{22970}DON'T YOU EVER|CALL HIM THAT!
{23024}{23090}HE'S A STUPID DUMMY!
{23090}{23150}WHAT ARE YOU DOING|IN THIS ROOM?
{23222}{23282}WHAT IS THAT?
{23546}{23617}YOU'RE BOTH REACHING AN AGE|WHERE CHANGES WILL OCCUR...
{23630}{23678}IN YOUR ATTITUDE|TOWARDS THE OPPOSITE SEX.
{23684}{23754}THE REASON IS TO PREPARE YOU|TO BE MOTHERS AND FATHERS.
{23755}{23856}IF YOU DIDN'T BECOME MOTHERS AND|FATHERS THERE WOULDN'T BE BABIES,
{23856}{23903}AND THE HUMAN RACE|WOULD DISAPPEAR.
{23904}{23990}NATURE CAN'T ALLOW THAT.|SO SHE EQUIPS EACH OF US...
{23990}{24072}WITH A BIOLOGICAL NEED TO JOIN|TOGETHER AND CREATE NEW LIFE.
{24084}{24189}AND THAT IS WHY, JUST AS PEOPLE GET|THIRSTY FOR WATER, THEY GET THIRSTY FOR SEX.
{24240}{24300}DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS|BEFORE I CONTINUE?
{24346}{24394}DOES EVERY SINGLE PERSON|HAVE A NEED?
{24398}{24514}IF THEY'RE NORMAL, THEY DO.|ANY MORE QUESTIONS?
{24562}{24644}ALL RIGHT. LET'S BEGIN WITH|THE MALE SEXUAL APPARATUS.
{24645}{24708}LEON, TAKE THE TOWEL|OFF MY LAP.
{24758}{24828}LEON! DO IT!
{24829}{24898}I'LL DO IT.
{25156}{25216}HOW DID YOU LIKE|PIN'S LECTURE?
{25216}{25300}OH, MARCIA BATEMAN ALREADY|TOLD ME ALL THAT STUFF.
{25301}{25348}BUT NOT ABOUT THE NEED.
{25396}{25468}DO YOU THINK MOTHER AND FATHER|EVER HAVE THE NEED?
{25469}{25528}THEY MUST.|WE'RE HERE, AREN'T WE?
{25540}{25600}IT'S SO HARD|TO PICTURE.
{25600}{25696}I'LL BET YOU BEFORE THEY DO IT, MOTHER|WASHES HIS PENIS WITH SPIC & SPAN.
{25792}{25828}DO YOU EVER HAVE|THE NEED, LEON?
{25840}{25912}NO. I'M NOT OLD ENOUGH.
{25948}{25996}I CAN'T WAIT|TO BE OLD ENOUGH.
{26020}{26080}I THINK I'M REALLY|GONNA LIKE IT.
{26214}{26262}COMIN' THROUGH.
{27100}{27147}COOL IT.
{27148}{27208}WHAT DO YOU NEED IT|NOW FOR?
{27208}{27267}WHAT DO YOU NEED IT FOR|NOW?
{27268}{27388}HOW YOU DOIN', LEON?|YOU CAN GET IT LATER.
{27540}{27594}GUYS, WAIT FOR ME.
{27790}{27850}? I KNOW?
{27862}{27934}? I GOT A BETTER IDEA?
{27942}{28014}? I SHOULD'VE LISTENED|TO MY MOTHER?
{28015}{28086}? I SHOULD'VE KEPT|MY HEART AWAY?
{28122}{28170}? WELL, ARE YOU HAPPY?
{28194}{28242}? YES, I REALLY THINK SO?
{28278}{28350}? WE'RE IN A LOT OF DANGER?|MARCIA.
{28351}{28422}- HI, LEON.|- HAVE YOU SEEN URSULA?
{28422}{28494}WELL, LAST TIME I SAW HER, SHE|WAS DANCING WITH EDDIE MORRIS.
{28506}{28602}- ? LET'S GO?|- LEON, YOU WANNA DANCE?
{28614}{28662}? WE ARE?
{28662}{28758}? ON THE RUN?
{28770}{28830}DO YOU THINK I SHOULD SLEEP|WITH HIM? YOU HAVE TO DO IT.
{28831}{28878}OH, I DON'T KNOW.
{29490}{29538}NO!|JESUS CHRIST!
{29634}{29670}LEON! NO!
{29670}{29754}SON OF A BITCH!|I'LL KILL YOU!
{29838}{29910}I'LL KILL HIM!
{29934}{30000}STOP IT!
{30001}{30066}KILL HIM!
{30258}{30318}HOW MANY GUYS|YOU BEEN SCREWIN'?
{30378}{30426}HOW MANY? THE WHOLE|GODDAMN FOOTBALL TEAM?
{30486}{30534}HOW MANY?
{30599}{30684}I'LL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW,
{30684}{30744}I DON'T WANT A SISTER|WHO'S A TRAMP.
{30806}{30854}IF YOU EVER...
{30890}{30962}DO IT AGAIN, YOU CAN|FORGET I'M YOUR BROTHER.
{32700}{32760}HI.|HI.
{32904}{32976}THIS CALCULUS|IS JUST KILLING ME.
{33240}{33296}I THINK I'M PREGNANT.
{33368}{33428}IT'S BEEN NEARLY TWO MONTHS|SINCE MY LAST PERIOD.
{33560}{33608}YOU PROMISED ME YOU WOULDN'T|DO IT ANYMORE.
{33609}{33656}I HAVEN'T.
{33668}{33740}LEON, COUNT THE WEEKS. IT'S|FROM BEFORE THE PROMISE.
{33836}{33908}WHAT AM I GONNA DO?|TELL FATHER.
{33968}{34088}NO, I CAN'T. YOU HAVE TO. YOU HAVE TO|FIND OUT FOR SURE IF YOU'RE PREGNANT.
{34089}{34172}I COULD GO TO|SOMEBODY ELSE.
{34172}{34220}THERE'S ONLY SIX DOCTORS|IN THE WHOLE TOWN.
{34220}{34304}YOU'RE 15 YEARS OLD. YOU THINK|THEY'RE NOT GONNA CALL YOUR FATHER?
{34364}{34424}I CAN'T, LEON.|HE'D HATE ME.
{34532}{34604}IF YOU'RE PREGNANT, HE'S GONNA|FIND OUT ANYWAY. YOU CAN'T HIDE IT.
{34724}{34808}I'LL WAIT. I MEAN,|MAYBE I'LL GET IT.
{34808}{34868}AND MAYBE YOU'LL WAIT TOO LONG AND|YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO HAVE AN ABORTION.
{34869}{34928}DO YOU WANT A BABY|AT YOUR AGE?
{35444}{35498}LET'S TALK TO PIN.
{35546}{35666}LEON. I'M COMING TO YOU WITH THE BIGGEST PROBLEM|IN MY WHOLE LIFE, AND YOU WANT ADVICE FROM-
{35674}{35770}FROM WHAT?|WHAT?
{35818}{35890}LEON, HE WON'T TALK TO US.
{35938}{35998}YOU KNOW THAT HE WON'T TALK|TO US IF FATHER'S NOT THERE.
{36010}{36069}THAT'S BECAUSE HE'S LOYAL.
{36070}{36130}HE KNOWS FATHER DOESN'T LIKE US|TALKING TO HIM.
{36138}{36198}WHY GO TO HIM|IF HE WON'T TALK?
{36336}{36384}THIS IS DIFFERENT.
{36396}{36516}A REALLY IMPORTANT DECISION HAS TO BE MADE|HERE. I CAN'T BELIEVE HE WON'T HELP US.
{36746}{36794}LEAVE THE LIGHTS.
{36950}{36998}HI, PIN.
{37106}{37154}URSULA.
{37203}{37252}HELLO, PIN.
{37360}{37432}I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL|ABOUT FATHER'S RULES,
{37432}{37502}AND I ADMIRE YOU|FOR BEING SO LOYAL.
{37552}{37612}BUT URSULA HAS A DECISION|TO MAKE.
{37670}{37766}SHE THINKS SHE'S PREGNANT. I|THINK SHE SHOULD TELL THE DOCTOR.
{37766}{37838}SHE'S AFRAID.|SHE WANTS TO WAIT.
{37884}{37956}SHE'LL DO WHATEVER|YOU TELL HER TO DO, PIN.
{37979}{38046}PLEASE.|PLEASE HELP HER.
{38094}{38160}IT'S NO USE, LEON.
{38222}{38282}LEON, LET'S GO HOME.|NO!
{38402}{38452}I KNOW HE'LL HELP US.
{38476}{38572}I'M GOING.|DON'T GO.
{38578}{38646}LEON IS RIGHT.
{38697}{38777}THE DOCTOR IS|A TRULY SCIENTIFIC MAN.
{38778}{38862}I DON'T THINK MORALITY|WILL AFFECT HIS ATTITUDE.
{38874}{38958}YOU MADE A MISTAKE|AND IT MUST BE RECTIFIED.
{39186}{39269}PLEASE EXCUSE HER, PIN.|SHE'S REALLY UPSET.
{39270}{39352}I UNDERSTAND. I REALLY|APPRECIATE YOUR ADVICE.
{39353}{39500}ANYTIME. YOU AND I HAVE A|GREAT DEAL TO TALK ABOUT.
{39620}{39716}I TOLD YOU HE'D HELP US. I KNEW IF IT WAS|REALLY IMPORTANT, THAT HE'D TALK TO US.
{39740}{39786}WHEN DID YOU LEARN|HOW TO DO THAT?
{39810}{39930}DO WHAT? GOD.|IT WAS INCREDIBLE.
{39930}{40026}TO STAND THERE AND HAVE HIM|TELL ME HE WANTS TO TALK TO ME.
{40050}{40098}TO ME.
{40110}{40158}WHAT'S THE MATTER?
{40194}{40290}NO EDUCATION LIKE|THE REAL THING. EH, PIN?
{40374}{40494}AFTER ALL THE TIME YOU TOOK|EXPLAINING SEX TO THEM,
{40495}{40578}GIVING THEM A BETTER START|THAN I HAD,
{40614}{40662}WHERE DOES IT GET ME?
{40686}{40734}SUNDAY IN THE OFFICE.
{40806}{40866}OKAY, URSULA.|ON THE TABLE.
{41172}{41232}AREN'T YOU GOING|TO OBSERVE, LEON?
{41304}{41352}NO, SIR.

{41472}{41544}AND LEON, AS FAR AS|YOUR MOTHER'S CONCERNED,

{43436}{43555}I DON'T APPRECIATE DISOBEDIENCE.|WHY CAN'T I GO TO BUTLER COLLEGE?
{43560}{43638}BECAUSE I WANT YOU|TO GET OUT OF THIS TOWN.
{43639}{43716}I LIKE IT HERE.|THAT'S WHY YOU SHOULD GO.
{43717}{43764}IT'S STIFLING.
{43812}{43872}COULDN'T I WAIT TILL|THE SPRING SEMESTER? NO.

{45076}{45135}IF YOU GO BACK NOW|WE'LL BE LATE.
{45136}{45228}I CAN'T GIVE THE SPEECH IF I DON'T|HAVE THE CASE HISTORIES WITH ME.
{46122}{46196}I DON'T THINK THE DOCTOR|KNOWS ENOUGH ABOUT THE COLLEGE.
{46208}{46268}HE DOESN'T LIKE ANYTHING|THAT'S SECOND-RATE.
{46400}{46495}BUT I'LL MISS YOU.|I'LL MISS YOU.
{46496}{46567}BUT YOU HAVE TO THINK|ABOUT YOUR FUTURE.
{46568}{46627}I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'LL DO|WITH MY FUTURE.
{46628}{46733}WHATEVER YOU DO, YOU NEED TO GET|THE BEST EDUCATION YOU CAN GET.
{46734}{46838}THAT'S WHAT FATHER SAYS.|HAS HE BEEN TALKING TO YOU?

{53380}{53427}VERY SORRY.
{53428}{53524}IT WON'T TAKE MORE THAN A WEEK TO|SUBLET MY APARTMENT AND GET BACK HERE.
{53524}{53583}THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY,|AUNT DOROTHY. WE'LL BE FINE.
{53584}{53655}FATHER LEFT US A BIG ESTATE. I'M|NOT TALKING ABOUT MONEY, LEON.
{53656}{53740}I'M NOT GONNA LET MY SISTER'S LITTLE|GIRL GROW UP WITHOUT A WOMAN AROUND.

{55982}{56030}YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE?
{56114}{56162}THIS PLASTIC.
{56388}{56484}AND TOMORROW WE CAN HAVE CHICKEN.|AND THEN THERE'S RIBS AND BURGERS.
{56496}{56544}WE NEVER HAVE TO COOK AGAIN.
{56616}{56664}I ALWAYS WANTED TO LEARN|HOW TO COOK,
{56676}{56736}BUT SHE SAID I WOULD MAKE|TOO MUCH OF A MESS.
{56880}{56928}WHAT?
{56974}{57044}CAN WE CLEAN UP|BEFORE WE GO TO BED?
{58562}{58622}SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
{58706}{58778}LEON! YOU CAN'T DO THIS!
{58784}{58820}I THINK WE SHOULD|DISCUSS THIS OUTSIDE.
{58832}{58878}FATHER DID NOT WANT HIM|IN THE HOUSE! OUTSIDE!
{58926}{58973}I DON'T HAVE TO BE REMINDED|ABOUT FATHER'S ATTITUDE,
{58974}{59034}AND I THINK IT'S RUDE OF YOU|TO BRING IT UP IN FRONT OF PIN.
{59046}{59093}FATHER'S DEAD.
{59094}{59166}WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN|TO PIN IF I DIDN'T BRING HIM HOME?
{59166}{59238}HE'D PROBABLY BE LOCKED|IN SOME CLOSET OR KILLED.
{59274}{59333}HE'S FAMILY-
{59334}{59454}MORE THAN ANY STUPID AUNT DOROTHY|- AND I WANT HIM HERE.
{59454}{59538}AUNT DOROTHY'S GONNA HAVE A FIT|WHEN SHE SEES HIM.
{59704}{59752}SHE WON'T SEE HIM.
{59788}{59836}I'LL PUT HIM IN THE ATTIC.|I'LL KEEP THE DOOR LOCKED.
{59884}{59955}BESIDES,
{59956}{60016}I DON'T THINK AUNT DOROTHY WILL|BE STAYING WITH US FOR VERY LONG.
{60028}{60075}WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
{60076}{60135}DO YOU WANT HER HERE?
{60136}{60196}PEOPLE DON'T STAY IN A PLACE|THEY'RE NOT WANTED.
{60208}{60316}IT MIGHT TAKE HER A LITTLE WHILE TO FEEL|THE VIBRATIONS, BUT I THINK SHE WILL.
{60412}{60508}DON'T WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING.|HAVEN'T I ALWAYS TAKEN CARE OF YOU?
{60544}{60602}YES.
{60603}{60650}AND I ALWAYS WILL.
{60698}{60746}GOOD NIGHT.
{60878}{60986}SORRY, PIN. THAT'S ALL|RIGHT, LEON. I UNDERSTAND.
{62276}{62372}LEON, WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL|THE COVERS ON THE FURNITURE?
{62372}{62467}I TOOK THEM OFF. I HOPE|YOU DIDN'T THROW THEM AWAY.
{62468}{62576}I STORED THEM. GOOD. THIS|IS VERY EXPENSIVE FURNITURE.
{62576}{62636}WE DON'T WANT|IT RUINED.
{62779}{62857}YOU KNOW HOW SHE IS.|SO MUCH LIKE HER SISTER.
{62858}{62960}THEY WERE MADE FROM THE SAME MOLD. SHE'LL|HAVE THIS HOUSE SHIPSHAPE IN NO TIME.
{62960}{63062}FIRST THE PLASTIC COVERS WILL GO BACK.|THEN THE FIREPLACE WILL BE SEALED SHUT.
{63062}{63155}IT WILL BE JUST LIKE OLD TIMES.
{63238}{63322}I WASN'T ABLE TO FIND|ALL THE PLASTIC COVERS.
{63334}{63370}DO YOU KNOW|WHERE THEY ARE?
{63382}{63418}THEY'RE IN THE ATTIC.
{63430}{63490}OH, I LOOKED UP THERE,|BUT THE DOOR WAS LOCKED.
{63490}{63538}SOMEBODY LOST THE KEY.
{63550}{63622}OH, WELL. I'LL JUST CALL|THE LOCKSMITH IN THE MORNING.
{63718}{63789}DON'T YOU LIKE YOUR|DINNER, LEON? MM. YEAH.
{63790}{63862}I'M SURE IT'S NOT AS GOOD|AS YOUR MOTHER USED TO MAKE.

{64334}{64405}AH, THAT'S WONDERFUL.
{64406}{64466}YOU NEVER TOLD ME|ABOUT THAT.
{64478}{64524}IT JUST HAPPENED.
{64532}{64614}WHAT DO YOU NEED A JOB FOR?|YOU HAVE PLENTY OF MONEY.
{64615}{64686}WELL, A GOOD JOB IS WORTH|MORE THAN MONEY, LEON.
{64687}{64745}IT'S GOOD|FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH.
{64746}{64818}YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH|YOUR MENTAL HEALTH, URSULA?
{64846}{64906}I JUST WANNA DO IT.|OKAY?
{64956}{65028}ARE YOU FINISHED?|JUST WITH DINNER.
{65220}{65328}SHE IS TAKING OVER|THE HOUSE.
{65329}{65399}SHE'S CHANGING URSULA.
{65400}{65472}SHE NEVER KEPT THINGS|FROM YOU BEFORE.
{65473}{65544}YOU NEVER HAD SECRETS|FROM EACH OTHER.
{65568}{65652}YOU'D BETTER|DO SOMETHING, LEON.
{65653}{65700}NOW.
{65794}{65878}HI. PIN'S SUGGESTION. HE|FEELS I WAS RUDE TO YOU.
{65926}{65985}YOU WERE RUDE|TO AUNT DOROTHY.
{65986}{66058}WELL, SHE'S GONE TO BED.|I'LL APOLOGIZE IN THE MORNING.
{66058}{66106}FRIENDS?
{66130}{66190}OH. CHOCOLATE'S FOR YOU.

{69547}{69614}BUT JUDGING FROM THE MEDICATION|ON HER NIGHT TABLE,
{69626}{69673}SHE HAD A BAD TICKER.
{69674}{69733}I'M SORRY YOU KIDS|HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS.
{69734}{69816}YOU TELL LEON IF HE STILL FEELS|SICK TOMORROW TO CALL ME.

{73422}{73482}A POET.|WHAT DO YOU THINK?
{73518}{73610}THAT'S FINE. WELL, YOU DON'T|SOUND SO EXCITED ABOUT IT.
{73670}{73718}DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM|WITH IT?

{74570}{74637}AND FOR YOU TO TREAT HIM|THE WAY YOU JUST DID!
{74638}{74709}THE WAY YOU HAVE SINCE HE|CAME HERE IS GODDAMN CRUEL!
{74710}{74818}I WANT YOU TO GO DOWNSTAIRS|RIGHT NOW AND APOLOGIZE TO HIM.
{74826}{74922}NOW! NO! I AM NOT GOING|TO APOLOGIZE TO ANY STUPID-
{74923}{74962}SHUT UP!
{75330}{75377}THERE ARE THREE OF US|IN THIS HOUSE NOW.

{79020}{79099}I THINK SO.|WHAT DOES HE LOOK LIKE?
{79100}{79172}HE'S GOT LIGHT BROWN HAIR|AND HAZEL EYES.
{79183}{79250}HE'S KIND OF|ATHLETIC LOOKING.
{79250}{79316}A JOCK.|HE PLAYED BASKETBALL.
{79351}{79411}WHY DO YOU ASK?
{79412}{79471}HE GOES TO|BUTLER COLLEGE NOW.
{79471}{79543}HE'S BEEN TO THE LIBRARY|THREE TIMES THIS WEEK.
{79543}{79628}I THINK HE'S LESS INTERESTED|IN THE BOOKS THAN HE IS IN ME.
{79748}{79795}DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU?
{79796}{79868}YOU'VE TURNED INTO|A BEAUTIFUL GIRL.
{79868}{79916}YOU'RE PREJUDICED.

{81971}{82080}THE REASON I CALLED EARLIER IS BECAUSE|STAN HAS INVITED ME OUT FOR DINNER.

{85883}{85943}IT'S JUST MIDNIGHT.|THAT'S HARDLY EARLY.
{85945}{85993}I WAS HAVING|SUCH A GOOD TIME.
{85993}{86089}HE'S SO SENSITIVE. HE'S TAKING PHYS|ED, BUT HE'S INTERESTED IN TRAVELING,
{86090}{86150}AND HE'S EVEN STUDYING|FOREIGN LANGUAGES ON HIS OWN.
{86150}{86198}I THINK YOU TWO COULD BE|REALLY GOOD FRIENDS.
{86204}{86273}I TOLD HIM ABOUT YOUR POETRY.|HE'S REAL INTERESTED.
{86274}{86346}MY POETRY'S PRIVATE. AND ANY GUY|WHO KEEPS A GIRL OUT THIS LATE...
{86347}{86415}WHEN SHE HAS TO WORK IN THE|MORNING IS HARDLY SENSITIVE.
{86524}{86589}LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
{86602}{86698}I LIKE HIM, AND I'M|GOING OUT WITH HIM AGAIN.
{87008}{87083}SINCE MY PARENTS DIED, I'VE BEEN BUSY|WITH THE HOUSE AND THE FINANCES...

{90906}{90941}IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN PIN.
{90954}{91013}WHO'S PIN?
{91013}{91097}HE'S A FRIEND|WHO'S STAYING WITH US.

{98886}{98951}I DON'T EVEN KNOW THIS GUY,|AND I SHOULD, SO-
{98951}{99035}SO I WANT YOU TO INVITE HIM|OVER TO THE HOUSE FOR DINNER.

{99360}{99432}I THOUGHT WE COULD HAVE SOME DRINKS,|I'LL MAKE COQ AU VIN, WILD RICE.
{99444}{99492}DOESN'T THAT SOUND|LIKE A GREAT EVENING?

{104546}{104617}HE GETS REALLY P.O.'D. HE GRABS|THIS KID, AND HE NAILS HIM.
{104617}{104713}THE FUNNY THING IS, WE WIN THE|CHAMPIONSHIP, AND HE LOSES HIS JOB.
{104845}{104904}LEON, YOU'RE NOT EATING.
{104905}{104987}I LOST MY APPETITE.
{104988}{105084}THAT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THOSE|OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS WITH CHEFS.

{105204}{105300}YOU KNOW, YOU COULD PROBABLY BECOME|ONE OF THOSE, UH, CORDON BLEUCHEFS.

{105576}{105612}OH, YES, LEON, PLEASE.
{105624}{105684}YOU REALLY HAVE|TO HEAR IT. IT'S WONDERFUL.

{106126}{106233}IS OUT TO GAIN IMMORTALITY, UM,
{106233}{106304}BY CREATING AS MUCH|PROGENY AS HE CAN.
{106400}{106447}SORRY.
{106448}{106556}HE'LL MAKE LOVE TO ANY WOMAN|IN HOPES OF IMPREGNATING HER.
{106557}{106664}AT THIS POINT HE'S FATHERED,|UH, 173 CHILDREN.
{106675}{106747}QUITE A POTENT GUY.
{106903}{107023}UM, IN THESE LINES, HE'S|CONTEMPLATING RAPE FOR THE FIRST TIME.
{107094}{107178}"CLOSER SHE CAME TO HIM, MOVING,|IT SEEMED, IN SILENT MOTION.
{107190}{107273}"HIS HEART BEAT STEADILY|WITHIN THE CAVERNS OF HIS BOSOM,
{107274}{107394}"DRIVING HOT BLOOD THICK DOWN,|DOWN INTO THE DEPTHS OF HIS LOINS.
{107395}{107502}"HE LUNGED FROM THE DEEPEST|DARKEST PASSIONS IN US ALL.
{107503}{107598}"SHE TURNED WITHOUT A SOUND|AND FACED HIM.
{107599}{107663}"HE STOPPED ABRUPTLY.
{107664}{107760}"IT WAS AS IF A KNIFE HAD|PERFORMED AN INSTANT CASTRATION.
{107761}{107855}HE WAS LOOKING|INTO THE EYES OF HIS SISTER."
{108101}{108161}DO YOU REALIZE THAT|OUTSIDE OF YOU AND URSULA,
{108161}{108257}HE'S THE FIRST PERSON TO HEAR MY|POETRY AND HE GENUINELY LIKED IT?
{108258}{108353}BE CAREFUL. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A|TENDENCY TOWARD BLIND OPTIMISM.
{108353}{108473}I'D LOVE TO SIT AND ARGUE, PIN. BUT I'D LIKE|TO GET DOWNSTAIRS, IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU.
{108584}{108668}HE NEEDS PSYCHIATRIC HELP.|I CAN'T DO THAT.
{108669}{108727}YOU HAVE TO.
{108728}{108818}HE REALLY BELIEVES THAT|THAT THING IS A PERSON.
{108819}{108908}DOESN'T HE REALIZE|HE'S USING VENTRILOQUISM?
{108909}{108979}HE'S NOT HURTING ANYONE.
{108980}{109063}HE CAN JUST GO ON LIVING HERE|AND WRITING HIS POETRY.
{109064}{109197}HIS POETRY IS SICK. HE'S|TALKING ABOUT RAPING HIS SISTER.
{109198}{109291}IT'S JUST A POEM.|IS IT?
{109351}{109435}WOULD YOU LIKE|ANOTHER DRINK, STAN?

{109819}{109879}GOOD NIGHT.
{110202}{110259}DO YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW|WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
{110283}{110393}I'VE READ EVERY PSYCHIATRIC|TEXT IN THE LIBRARY.
{110394}{110465}LEON IS A PARANOID|SCHIZOPHRENIC.
{110501}{110585}NO ONE IS EVER|GONNA CURE HIM OF THAT.
{110633}{110717}BUT HE'S MY BROTHER,

{126954}{127002}WHY DIDN'T HE CALL ME|AT THE LIBRARY?
{127005}{127080}PERHAPS YOU HAD ALREADY LEFT.
{127782}{127829}DID HE SAY HE'D CALL BACK?
