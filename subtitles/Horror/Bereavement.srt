1
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:41,124
( wind whistling )

2
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,836
( birds calling )

3
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:56,515
( door creaks )

4
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,621
Hey, he's right here.

5
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:49,813
Woman:
l've only read about it.

6
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:52,149
l know it's extremely rare.

7
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,194
So he can't feel

8
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,279
or touch?

9
00:03:57,321 --> 00:04:01,325
No, he responds
to normal touch and pressure.

10
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:05,204
His body just can't recognize
sensations of pain.

11
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,332
ClPA is a very
dangerous condition.

12
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:11,335
He could bite his own tongue off
and not even realize it.

13
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,379
He could break a bone
and keep on playing.

14
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,466
Even hot foods have to be checked
before he eats them.

15
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:18,675
Of course.

16
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,149
He has to be checked hourly
for cuts and bruises,

17
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:37,736
and not just his arms and legs,
but his whole body,

18
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,404
even inside his mouth.

19
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,573
This is very important.

20
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,493
Martin can't tell
when something hurts.

21
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:46,495
Hi there.

22
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:49,206
l bought this new bike
for my nephew's birthday,

23
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:51,500
but he doesn't like the color.

24
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,627
Can you believe that?

25
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:55,754
l was gonna just throw it out

26
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,923
when l saw you and l thought,

27
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:00,384
''There's a kid who'd probably love
a new bike.''

28
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,803
Am l right?

29
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:05,722
lt's right in my truck.
Want to take a look?

30
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,771
Do you like red?

31
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:16,733
lt's difficult and exhausting.

32
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,236
l've been through
two aides already.

33
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:21,280
You don't have to worry,
Mrs. Bristol.

34
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,866
Whatever you need, l'm here.

35
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,327
Would you like to meet him now?

36
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:30,205
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

37
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,924
Mrs. Bristol:
Oh God.

38
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,427
Martin!

39
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,722
Martin!

40
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:49,725
( distant dog barking )

41
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,450
( rain pattering )

42
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,745
( thunder crashing )

43
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,156
( man grunting )

44
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:05,008
( woman sobbing )

45
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,483
Don't be afraid.

46
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:24,403
lt doesn't have any feelings.

47
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,493
( woman gasps, sobbing )

48
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,707
lt doesn't hurt, see?

49
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,175
( woman screams )

50
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,185
( woman screaming )

51
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:09,239
( continues screaming )
No!

52
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:11,074
lt'll be over soon.

53
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,454
( woman screaming )

54
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:22,461
- ( woman screaming )
- ( thunder rumbling )

55
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,675
( thunder crashing )

56
00:08:59,623 --> 00:08:59,790
( birds chirping )

57
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,000
( birds chirping )

58
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:13,512
( music playing on radio )

59
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:04,021
lt's good to see you.

60
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:09,359
How are you holding up?

61
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,695
Okay.

62
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:16,658
You know, you were here
once before.

63
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,454
You were about that big.

64
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,498
Remember?

65
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,500
Not really.

66
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,254
So that's everything?

67
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:32,508
Yeah.

68
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,551
Okay.

69
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:58,450
# lf l could see #

70
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:02,579
# Beyond this moment #

71
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:08,085
# l'd hope to see you #

72
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:11,213
# Looking... #

73
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,801
How long do l have to
give up my room?

74
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:18,679
Well, just until your father finishes
remodeling the den.

75
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,430
l'll be in college.

76
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,767
They're here!

77
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:26,937
Now remember,
calm and compassionate.

78
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:28,772
No, Wen-- Wendy.

79
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,072
Hi.

80
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:39,533
She's an only child.

81
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:41,743
- Hi!
- Hi.

82
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,495
- Do you like mice?
- No.

83
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:45,664
- How about snakes?
- No.

84
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:48,292
l can do a cartwheel.
Want to see?

85
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,461
Oh, Allison, look at you.

86
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,547
- Oh.
- ( Wendy chattering )

87
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:55,465
Mom, get out of the way.

88
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:57,968
You didn't tell me
how pretty she is.

89
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,720
My side of the family.

90
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,847
- You must be starving.
- Not really.

91
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:03,473
Come on, Randy.

92
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:06,226
This dog is always
under my feet.

93
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:08,270
Come on in.

94
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:11,398
- Hey, Dad, need some help?
- Yeah, l could use a hand.

95
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,650
Mom, Dad needs some help.

96
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:18,655
Do you really get up at 4:00
every morning?

97
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:20,616
When l'm in training, yeah.

98
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,326
Can't you use a treadmill?

99
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,036
Dad's got one.
He hangs his shirts on it.

100
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,746
Wendy.

101
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,706
Allison:
l run distance.

102
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:31,001
This is my room,

103
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:33,295
or was my room.

104
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:37,508
Now you'll be sleeping here just until
Jonathan finishes remodeling the den.

105
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:39,510
You didn't have to do that.

106
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:42,638
( squeaking )

107
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,682
Whiskers, how did you get out of there?

108
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:47,684
You naughty little boy.

109
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,520
We'll be having supper
in just a few minutes.

110
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:53,106
lf you need anything,
just give a shout.

111
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:56,860
This is your home too now.

112
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:08,914
She's really taking it hard.

113
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:12,251
Well, what do you expect?

114
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:16,046
Her whole life's been turned
upside down overnight.

115
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:21,051
( music playing over radio )

116
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:24,346
Hey, Melissa,
are you leaving already?

117
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:26,348
Yeah.

118
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,644
Hey, can you cover
my shift tomorrow?

119
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:32,396
l have exams.

120
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:34,898
l know. l have to take Jesse
to the doctor again.

121
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,401
How about Danielle?

122
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:39,945
l asked her already.

123
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:42,739
Yeah, okay.

124
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,741
- Thank you, sweetie.
- No problem.

125
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,945
( honks horn )

126
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:30,579
Hey, you're blocking my car.

( Melissa crying )
No. No, wait, please.

00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,078
No no, please.

134
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,122
What are you doing?

135
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:57,207
Are you crazy?

136
00:15:57,249 --> 00:15:59,168
No. Ow. Ow.

Help.

Woman: lt's no use.

147
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:49,111
Who's there?

148
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:54,533
Hello?

149
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:56,743
We're gonna die down here.

150
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:58,787
No.

151
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:02,291
No, we're gonna get out of here.

152
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:04,501
What day is it?

153

- Are you all right?
- l think so.

165
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:42,432
They wouldn't brake for the pope
on this road.

Yeah, l see that.

Your-- your arm is bleeding.

168

You want to come inside?
You can wash up.

lt's nothing.

170
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:50,274
Oh shit.

171
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:53,068
- Are you sure you're all right?
- Yeah, it's just my leg.

172
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,903
You want me to give you
a ride home?

173
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:57,573
No, it's okay, really.

174
00:19:57,614 --> 00:20:00,242
lt's not a big deal,
just a couple miles up the street.

175
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:02,494
How do you know?

176
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:04,246
Small town.

177
00:20:04,288 --> 00:20:06,081
Come on.
What are neighbors for?

178
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:08,792
A few miles?
That's hardly neighbors.

179
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:10,961
Around here that's
a next-door neighbor.

180
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:14,756
Okay, sure.

181
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:16,675
All right, l'll be right back.

182
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:22,931
Ow.

183
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:35,402
Uh, l think l'm just gonna walk.

184
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:36,695
Are you afraid?

185
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:38,447
l'm not afraid.

186
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:40,991
Great.

187
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:43,076
Then get on.

188
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:49,166
What's your name?

189
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,793
- Allison.
- William.

190
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:53,545
Slow down.

191
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:55,714
l've never been on one
of these things before.

192
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:59,218
After my accident the doctor said
l'd never ride again.

193
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,471
l'm kidding.

194
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,807
So where are you from?

195
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:07,976
Chicago.

196
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:10,270
l was there once.

197
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:12,731
What brings you to this armpit?

198
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:15,234
l came to live with my uncle.

199
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:18,904
A problem with the parents?

200
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:20,989
Family issues?

201
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:23,367
Yeah.

202
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:25,494
You too, huh?

203
00:21:25,536 --> 00:21:27,955
What kind of problems?

204
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:32,543
They're dead.

205
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,046
Shit, l'm sorry.

206
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:38,131
Yeah.

207
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:40,175
Me too.

208
00:21:55,232 --> 00:21:57,359
Thanks for the ride.

209
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,280
Keep it.

210
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:03,407
You need it.

211
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:21,300
Man on radio: Still no leads
in the disappearance

212
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:23,343
of college student Melissa Barnes
who was last seen

213
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:25,971
leaving her place of employment
at the Charcoal Diner...

214
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:28,348
Hey, how was your run?

215
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,392
lnteresting.

216
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,522
( thunder rumbling, crashing )

217
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:48,368
Woman:
Melissa, l-- l think

218
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,746
my hand is coming loose.

219
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:51,914
( door opens )

220
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:58,504
He's coming.
Don't make a sound.

221
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:01,089
We're gonna get out of here.

222
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,644
Man: When steer are led
to slaughter,

223
00:23:13,685 --> 00:23:17,314
they smell the stench
of fear and blood

224
00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:19,233
and they panic.

225
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:26,240
Sometimes we'd have to saw off
their hind legs

226
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:29,284
so they couldn't run.

227
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:37,292
No.

228
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:39,336
No, please.

229
00:23:41,797 --> 00:23:43,173
Woman: No.

230
00:23:43,215 --> 00:23:45,843
No. Oh God!

231
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:49,137
- ( knife tears flesh )
- ( woman screaming )

232
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:51,557
Man:
Hold her still.

233
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:53,600
( woman continues screaming )

234
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:56,186
Man:
Get back here.

235
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:58,647
( woman continues screaming )

236
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:06,864
( panting )

237
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:13,829
lt's okay.

238
00:24:13,871 --> 00:24:15,998
Everything's under control.

239
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:19,209
Looks like l got here
just in time.

240
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:28,302
( screaming )

241
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:34,892
When something outlasts
its usefulness,

242
00:24:34,892 --> 00:24:37,269
it gets discarded.

243
00:24:44,943 --> 00:24:46,278
( lock clicks )

244
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:00,250
( thunder crashing )

245
00:25:07,633 --> 00:25:10,052
( hissing )

246
00:25:29,947 --> 00:25:32,324
Still here?

247
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:44,795
( distant train horn blaring )

248
00:25:47,923 --> 00:25:50,300
- See you later.
- Yeah.

249
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:52,010
- Bye.
- Bye.

250
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:53,929
( clicks tongue )

251
00:25:53,971 --> 00:25:55,931
Are you sure you're all right?

252
00:25:55,973 --> 00:25:58,809
Yeah, gotta get it over with
sooner or later.

253
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:01,186
She'll be fine.

254
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,657
Nervous?

255
00:26:13,657 --> 00:26:15,742
You think they'll have
a decent track team?

256
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:18,954
Don't get your hopes up.

257
00:26:18,996 --> 00:26:20,747
No chance of that.

258
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:32,885
What is that place?

259
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:35,721
That's the Sutter plant.
lt's been closed for years.

260
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:38,390
l saw someone there yesterday
while l was jogging--

261
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:40,309
a boy.

262
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,186
A boy?

263
00:26:42,227 --> 00:26:44,146
Yeah, l thought so.

264
00:26:44,188 --> 00:26:46,523
Probably just some kids
vandalizing the place.

265
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:48,192
l kind of wish
you'd stay away from there

266
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:50,903
and jog on the main road.

267
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:52,946
Yeah, and get hit by a truck.

268
00:26:52,988 --> 00:26:55,741
Graham's a pack rat.
That place should be condemned.

269
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:57,784
Someone lives there?

270
00:26:57,826 --> 00:26:59,828
Yeah, he stays mostly
to himself.

271
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,955
You know him?

272
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:04,291
We're about the same age.

273
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:06,960
He never went to school.

274
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:10,005
His dad made him work at that place
day and night.

275
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:14,676
lt was a meat-packing plant

276
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:18,347
till they couldn't afford
to upgrade the equipment to code.

277
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:21,892
l'll tell you one thing:
l don't miss the smell.

278
00:27:35,781 --> 00:27:37,783
l'll pick you up at 2:30.

279
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:14,653
Silence is a sound

280
00:28:14,695 --> 00:28:17,531
of no fear...

281
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:23,078
no pain...

282
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:28,292
the sound of peace.

283
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,210
( grunts )

284
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:55,402
l envy your serenity.

285
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:05,037
The path to redemption

286
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:08,248
begins with forgiveness--

287
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:10,709
absolution.

288
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:15,172
You're my witness.

289
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,792
What did l tell you?

290
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:53,836
l told you don't touch,
didn't l?

291
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:59,174
William:
Yeah, the bolts are stripped.

292
00:29:59,216 --> 00:30:01,552
Cashier:
$17.50.

293
00:30:03,345 --> 00:30:06,306
- Can l owe you the 50 cents?
- Yeah, right.

294
00:30:06,348 --> 00:30:07,891
William:
Thanks, Eddie.

295
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:20,028
Jonathan, how's that
extension coming?

296
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,780
lt's going really good.

297
00:30:21,822 --> 00:30:23,323
( engine starts )

298
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:26,160
You know you've got
drywall nails here?

299
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:27,411
Hmm?

300
00:30:27,411 --> 00:30:29,496
Oh shit.

301
00:30:29,538 --> 00:30:32,624
Just cheerleading.
Unless you can kick a field goal.

302
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:34,209
That's it?

303
00:30:34,251 --> 00:30:37,254
There isn't much of a demand
for girls' sports in this area.

304
00:30:37,296 --> 00:30:39,882
Our cheerleading squad
did win Best Routine

305
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:42,259
in the state final last year.

306
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:47,764
( sighs )

307
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:49,600
( girls cheering )

308
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:51,351
Come on! Whoo-hoo!

309
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:53,604
Yeah!

310
00:30:54,688 --> 00:30:56,356
Girl: Ready?

311
00:30:56,398 --> 00:30:59,067
( girls chanting )
Let's shake it. Let's shout it.

312
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:01,361
PHS!

313
00:31:01,403 --> 00:31:04,072
Let's shake it.
Let's shout it.

314
00:31:04,114 --> 00:31:06,366
PHS!

315
00:31:06,408 --> 00:31:08,785
Let's shake it.
Let's shout it.

316
00:32:17,229 --> 00:32:19,439
Aren't you scared of that falling
and crushing you?

317
00:32:26,697 --> 00:32:28,782
How's your leg?

318
00:32:28,824 --> 00:32:32,202
Oh, it's better.

319
00:32:33,245 --> 00:32:37,124
So this is what you do--

320
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:39,501
fix cars?

321
00:32:39,543 --> 00:32:41,712
Guidance counselor told me
my aptitude tests said

322
00:32:41,753 --> 00:32:45,549
either medical school
or auto mechanic.

323
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:47,926
l can't stand the sight of blood, so...

324
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:54,683
Okay, well,
l don't want to bother you, so...

325
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,105
Hey.

326
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,109
Yeah?

327
00:33:04,151 --> 00:33:06,236
Are you busy later?

328
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:09,072
Um, l was gonna go home
and stare at the ceiling

329
00:33:09,072 --> 00:33:11,575
until l fell asleep. Why?

330
00:33:11,617 --> 00:33:13,327
Well, l was--

331
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:15,496
l was wondering if maybe
you wanted to--

332
00:33:15,537 --> 00:33:18,832
Man: Billy!

333
00:33:18,874 --> 00:33:21,418
Excuse me.

334
00:33:22,794 --> 00:33:24,796
- Billy!
- Dad?

335
00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:27,090
ln here.

336
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:29,468
- Christ.
- God.

337
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:32,721
l dropped the fucking remote.

338
00:33:32,763 --> 00:33:34,181
Be careful.

339
00:33:34,223 --> 00:33:36,058
- Ow, Jesus!
- Sorry, Dad.

340
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:37,935
- Oh man.
- You're dead weight.

341
00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:40,312
Yeah, well, l'm not dead yet.

342
00:33:40,354 --> 00:33:42,773
- Oh.
- Can l help?

343
00:33:42,814 --> 00:33:45,442
- Father: Just-- just lift me up.
- Yeah, just hold his chair.

344
00:33:45,484 --> 00:33:47,319
- Okay.
- Come on, just put me back on my chair.

345
00:33:47,361 --> 00:33:49,738
( grunts )
You got it.

346
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:53,951
- Allison: Here.
- ( both men grunt )

347
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:56,161
- Allison: Okay.
- You could have hurt yourself.

348
00:33:56,203 --> 00:33:58,205
What do you mean,
could have?

349
00:33:58,247 --> 00:34:00,999
( groans )

350
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:02,876
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

351
00:34:02,918 --> 00:34:06,129
Um, Dad, this is Allison.

352
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:08,590
Allison, this is my dad.

353
00:34:08,632 --> 00:34:10,259
- Allison: Hi.
- She's from Chicago.

354
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,552
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

355
00:34:11,593 --> 00:34:13,220
- From Chicago?
- Yeah.

356
00:34:13,262 --> 00:34:15,597
l hate Chicago.

357
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:21,061
- Hey, at least you're not gay, right?
- Dad.

358
00:34:21,103 --> 00:34:24,189
You know, he spends most of the time
alone in his room,

359
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:27,526
- doing who knows what.
- Yeah, you should talk.

360
00:34:27,568 --> 00:34:29,570
Yeah, but it's about the only thing
l've got left.

361
00:34:29,611 --> 00:34:31,864
Um, l should probably go.

362
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:33,448
William:
No, stay.

363
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:35,242
No, it's getting late.
l really have to get home.

364
00:34:35,284 --> 00:34:37,286
William:
He's not normally like this.

365
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:39,288
He's usually much worse.

366
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:42,207
Well, maybe you should give him
the helmet.

367
00:34:42,249 --> 00:34:43,625
Bye.

368
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:46,712
( door opens, closes )

369
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:49,047
What the hell
is the matter with you?

370
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:51,008
Can't she take a joke?

371
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,384
Hey, come on.

372
00:34:52,426 --> 00:34:54,678
Hey, toss me my cigarettes.

373
00:34:57,723 --> 00:35:00,893
Hey, what--?
Now what am l supposed to do?

374
00:35:56,323 --> 00:35:58,534
( scrubbing )

375
00:35:59,827 --> 00:36:01,870
What's your name?

376
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,166
Hello?

377
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:09,211
Can you answer me, please?

378
00:36:10,546 --> 00:36:12,923
Graham:
lf they have no feelings,

379
00:36:12,965 --> 00:36:15,425
they can't know fear.

380
00:36:21,557 --> 00:36:24,184
But if they can't know fear...

381
00:36:26,395 --> 00:36:28,981
why do they run?

382
00:36:29,022 --> 00:36:30,649
Let me go.

383
00:36:32,651 --> 00:36:33,819
All clean?

384
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,781
Come here.

385
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:57,426
What are you doing?

386
00:37:04,057 --> 00:37:06,059
Give me your arm.

387
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,979
Don't.

388
00:37:09,021 --> 00:37:11,565
Run!

389
00:37:11,607 --> 00:37:13,775
He doesn't understand.
Can't you see?

390
00:37:13,817 --> 00:37:17,196
Stop it. Stop it!

391
00:37:20,491 --> 00:37:22,451
His conscience is unburdened.

392
00:37:22,493 --> 00:37:24,119
You're crazy!

393
00:37:24,161 --> 00:37:26,163
ls yours?

394
00:37:26,205 --> 00:37:28,624
Let me go!
You're fucking crazy!

395
00:37:28,665 --> 00:37:31,084
Let me go!

396
00:37:35,005 --> 00:37:36,548
Oh God.

397
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:50,812
Where were you?

398
00:37:50,854 --> 00:37:52,731
Um, l'm sorry.

399
00:37:52,773 --> 00:37:54,608
You're sorry?

400
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,485
Jonathan.

401
00:37:56,527 --> 00:37:58,153
l thought we said 2:30.

402
00:37:58,195 --> 00:37:59,613
l left early.

403
00:37:59,655 --> 00:38:01,532
We were beginning to worry.

404
00:38:01,573 --> 00:38:04,243
Well, l said l'm sorry.

405
00:38:04,284 --> 00:38:06,912
Let's not make it a habit.

406
00:38:06,954 --> 00:38:09,081
- Okay?
- Okay.

407
00:38:10,249 --> 00:38:12,668
You've been to Paris?

408
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:14,086
Yeah, a few times.

409
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:16,380
Wow, you've been to so many
cool places.

410
00:38:16,421 --> 00:38:19,508
Yeah, my dad used to turn
all of his business trips

411
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,927
into family vacations.

412
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:24,805
He was great like that.

413
00:38:24,847 --> 00:38:26,682
l've never been anywhere.

414
00:38:26,723 --> 00:38:30,060
Well, maybe someday you can go
to Chicago with me.

415
00:38:30,102 --> 00:38:33,146
- Tomorrow?
- No.

416
00:38:33,188 --> 00:38:34,481
( knocks on door )

417
00:38:35,858 --> 00:38:38,443
Hi guys. Wendy.

418
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:40,696
Can l borrow your camera?

419
00:38:40,737 --> 00:38:42,698
Yeah, there's a few
more pictures left.

420
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:45,033
You can finish the roll
if you want.

421
00:38:45,075 --> 00:38:47,786
- ( camera shutter clicks )
- Dad, can we go to France?

422
00:38:47,828 --> 00:38:49,830
Sure. l'll cash in
some stock options.

423
00:38:49,872 --> 00:38:51,373
See what l mean?

424
00:38:51,415 --> 00:38:53,834
How about Pittsburgh, huh?

425
00:38:54,835 --> 00:38:57,171
Wendy: How much longer
do l have to give up my room?

426
00:38:57,212 --> 00:38:58,881
Jonathan:
Not much longer.

427
00:38:58,922 --> 00:39:02,050
Wendy: Don't you think
Whiskers needs a bigger cage?

428
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:04,386
Jonathan:
l think that cage is just fine.

429
00:39:04,428 --> 00:39:06,638
Do you think
Allison's happy here?

430
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,640
l hope so.

431
00:39:08,682 --> 00:39:11,810
l don't think she likes me.

432
00:39:11,852 --> 00:39:15,022
How could somebody
not like you?

433
00:39:15,063 --> 00:39:17,316
- l know, right?
- Right.

434
00:39:17,357 --> 00:39:18,859
( chuckles )

435
00:39:18,901 --> 00:39:20,903
You know, l'm-- l-- l--

436
00:39:20,944 --> 00:39:22,905
l'm feeling--
feeling something.

437
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:25,908
l'm feeling a little--
l'm feeling a little hungry.

438
00:39:25,949 --> 00:39:27,117
( Wendy giggling )
Oh no.

439
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:30,329
- l need a pillow sandwich.
- ( squeals, giggling )

440
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,915
( imitates chewing )

441
00:39:47,012 --> 00:39:49,014
Hello.

442
00:39:50,641 --> 00:39:51,975
Can you talk?

443
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:55,979
l can help you.

444
00:39:57,022 --> 00:40:00,818
You've just got to help me
get loose first.

445
00:40:07,533 --> 00:40:09,326
Please.

446
00:40:09,326 --> 00:40:11,036
Help me.

447
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:48,323
l've done everything
you've asked me.

448
00:40:56,206 --> 00:40:58,333
You could make it stop.

449
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:03,881
( heart beating )

450
00:41:03,922 --> 00:41:05,966
( whimpering )

451
00:41:29,156 --> 00:41:31,783
( screams )

452
00:41:31,825 --> 00:41:34,328
God damn it!

453
00:41:45,422 --> 00:41:47,758
( whimpering )

454
00:41:51,845 --> 00:41:53,931
( screaming )

455
00:42:44,064 --> 00:42:46,775
( Melissa screaming )

456
00:42:57,202 --> 00:42:59,163
( flesh rips )

457
00:43:21,643 --> 00:43:23,312
( continues screaming )

458
00:43:48,795 --> 00:43:50,797
( continues screaming )

459
00:44:09,066 --> 00:44:11,485
Now they can't trust you.

460
00:44:12,903 --> 00:44:15,489
You're gonna have to
make it up to them somehow.

461
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:19,326
They take advantage

462
00:44:19,368 --> 00:44:22,454
of vulnerability
and weakness.

463
00:44:22,496 --> 00:44:24,623
Bury it.

464
00:44:33,173 --> 00:44:35,592
The furnace needs scrubbing.

465
00:44:56,697 --> 00:44:58,991
Graham:
You caused all this.

466
00:45:50,542 --> 00:45:51,752
Be good, sweetie.

467
00:45:51,793 --> 00:45:53,462
l will.

468
00:46:00,385 --> 00:46:01,845
Whiskers, no.

469
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:06,600
Theories on our
emotional development

470
00:46:06,642 --> 00:46:08,894
are divided into
two schools of thought--

471
00:46:08,936 --> 00:46:11,188
whether we're products
of genetics

472
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:14,024
predisposed to exhibit
certain behavioral patterns,

473
00:46:14,024 --> 00:46:15,901
or products
of our environment.

474
00:46:15,943 --> 00:46:18,570
Evolutionary biologists believe

475
00:46:18,612 --> 00:46:20,614
that our inherited genes

476
00:46:20,656 --> 00:46:22,908
are what determine
development.

477
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:25,828
Opponents argue
that our individuality

478
00:46:25,869 --> 00:46:28,789
is directly influenced
by the patterns of behavior

479
00:46:28,831 --> 00:46:31,834
that we see and hear
every day.

480
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:33,836
ln other words,

481
00:46:33,877 --> 00:46:35,879
a child raised
in a loving environment

482
00:46:35,921 --> 00:46:39,007
will respond to the world
in a much different way

483
00:46:39,049 --> 00:46:42,135
than a child raised in fear
or taught to hate.

484
00:46:42,177 --> 00:46:46,014
Our children are in essence
mirror images of ourselves--

485
00:46:46,056 --> 00:46:48,600
our beliefs, our ideologies,

486
00:46:48,642 --> 00:46:51,061
our conscience--

487
00:46:51,061 --> 00:46:53,897
ground control to Major Tom--

488
00:46:53,897 --> 00:46:55,899
which brings us
to psychotherapy--

489
00:46:55,941 --> 00:46:59,027
the psychoanalytic theory
of personality.

490
00:46:59,069 --> 00:47:01,613
This will be on the test, people.

491
00:47:43,113 --> 00:47:44,948
Hey, need a ride?

492
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:46,492
Uh, l don't know.

493
00:47:46,533 --> 00:47:47,951
Come on, get in.

494
00:47:47,951 --> 00:47:50,454
Take a break.
Have some fun.

495
00:47:55,501 --> 00:47:57,252
Are you starting
your own pharmacy?

496
00:47:57,294 --> 00:47:59,338
l get headaches.

497
00:47:59,379 --> 00:48:01,131
l can't stay out late.

498
00:48:01,173 --> 00:48:03,967
Don't worry.
l'll have you back by Monday.

499
00:48:03,967 --> 00:48:06,136
Yeah, l restored it piece by piece.

500
00:48:06,178 --> 00:48:08,764
l thought about opening my own
body shop one day, but...

501
00:48:08,805 --> 00:48:11,266
Why don't you?

502
00:48:11,308 --> 00:48:14,937
Um, well, my dad--
he's not so good on his own.

503
00:48:14,978 --> 00:48:17,564
So how far do you run anyway?

504
00:48:17,606 --> 00:48:20,901
Five, six miles.

505
00:48:20,943 --> 00:48:23,445
l would have a heart attack.

506
00:48:23,487 --> 00:48:24,613
Yeah.

507
00:48:24,655 --> 00:48:26,532
These will give you
a heart attack.

508
00:48:28,367 --> 00:48:30,869
l guess you never eat
junk like this, huh?

509
00:48:30,911 --> 00:48:33,622
l'm not in training right now.

510
00:48:33,664 --> 00:48:35,457
Yeah, me neither.

511
00:48:36,834 --> 00:48:38,919
( insects chirping )

512
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:52,474
( engine starts )

513
00:48:54,268 --> 00:48:57,521
So do you have any
brothers or sisters?

514
00:48:57,563 --> 00:48:59,940
Just me and my dad.

515
00:48:59,982 --> 00:49:02,025
My mom died
a couple of years ago--

516
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:04,319
pneumonia.

517
00:49:04,361 --> 00:49:06,738
Has he always been, um--?

518
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:09,283
Yeah, he used to work
construction.

519
00:49:09,324 --> 00:49:12,661
He lost the use of his legs
in an accident

520
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:15,122
in Chicago, actually.

521
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,128
My father always wanted a boy.

522
00:49:23,213 --> 00:49:26,550
He was a track star

523
00:49:26,592 --> 00:49:31,471
and just missed qualifying
for the Olympics in '76.

524
00:49:31,513 --> 00:49:35,475
He tried to correct
that failure through me.

525
00:49:38,228 --> 00:49:40,189
They were driving home
from dinner

526
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:43,066
just a mile from the house and...

527
00:49:47,404 --> 00:49:49,490
an SUV blew a stop sign.

528
00:49:51,867 --> 00:49:54,036
lt's funny

529
00:49:54,077 --> 00:49:57,748
how everything can change
in an instant.

530
00:49:57,789 --> 00:49:59,791
A stranger can come along

531
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:04,129
and in the blink of an eye just

532
00:50:04,171 --> 00:50:07,633
destroy everything.

533
00:50:07,674 --> 00:50:10,636
So you came to live
with your uncle?

534
00:50:13,096 --> 00:50:16,183
l have a grandmother

535
00:50:16,225 --> 00:50:20,395
who lives in New York,
but she's agoraphobic,

536
00:50:20,437 --> 00:50:22,940
a real freak show, so...

537
00:50:24,483 --> 00:50:26,360
it was her or my uncle.

538
00:50:26,401 --> 00:50:29,363
l bet you wish
you went to New York now, huh?

539
00:50:32,616 --> 00:50:34,618
l hate New York.

540
00:50:52,636 --> 00:50:54,680
( truck approaching )

541
00:51:33,343 --> 00:51:35,345
Out of the car, Allison.

542
00:51:35,387 --> 00:51:37,431
- What?
- You heard me.

543
00:51:37,472 --> 00:51:40,726
- l'm not going anywhere.
- Yeah, back off, man.

544
00:51:40,767 --> 00:51:43,437
You shut your mouth!
Come on.

545
00:51:43,479 --> 00:51:46,899
- What are you doing?
- l'm taking you home.

546
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:48,150
Allison.

547
00:51:50,444 --> 00:51:53,447
Your mother and father worked hard
so you could be somebody.

548
00:51:53,489 --> 00:51:56,909
l'm not gonna let you derail that
by hanging out with that trailer trash.

549
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:58,952
You don't even know him.

550
00:51:58,994 --> 00:52:01,914
l know that kid better than you
ever will. lf your father was here--

551
00:52:01,955 --> 00:52:04,374
Look, sports, college--
that whole thing--

552
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:06,502
that was my father's dream,
not mine.

553
00:52:06,543 --> 00:52:08,504
l never wanted any of it.

554
00:52:08,545 --> 00:52:11,048
Well, what do you want? Do you want
to live in the back of a truck?

555
00:52:11,048 --> 00:52:12,591
Do you want to collect welfare?

556
00:52:12,633 --> 00:52:14,635
You think
l wanted to come here?

557
00:52:14,676 --> 00:52:17,721
You think l wanted
to come and live with you?

558
00:52:25,395 --> 00:52:27,773
My brother and l
made a promise

559
00:52:27,815 --> 00:52:30,234
a long time ago:

560
00:52:30,234 --> 00:52:33,195
Should something happen
to either of us,

561
00:52:33,237 --> 00:52:35,572
we'd be there
for each other's kids.

562
00:52:37,783 --> 00:52:41,745
lt's not one you ever expect
to have to keep,

563
00:52:41,787 --> 00:52:45,332
and l'm not going back
on my word,

564
00:52:45,374 --> 00:52:48,335
but it's your life.

565
00:52:48,377 --> 00:52:50,671
You want to try it out
on your own,

566
00:52:50,712 --> 00:52:53,048
go ahead.

567
00:52:55,342 --> 00:52:56,844
You want me to get out?

568
00:52:56,885 --> 00:52:59,388
l want you to make a choice.

569
00:53:06,562 --> 00:53:10,524
Okay, well, we'll do things
my way for a while,

570
00:53:10,566 --> 00:53:14,194
just as long as we understand
each other.

571
00:53:14,236 --> 00:53:16,238
( sniffling )

572
00:53:26,165 --> 00:53:28,584
( door squeaks )

573
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:45,809
( sobbing )

574
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,784
Woman: Oh no.

575
00:54:11,752 --> 00:54:14,796
No.

576
00:54:14,838 --> 00:54:18,509
l haven't done anything.
l haven't done anything.

577
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:20,636
Please.

578
00:54:20,677 --> 00:54:23,096
Graham:
Like l showed you.

579
00:54:23,138 --> 00:54:25,849
Woman:
Why are you doing this?

580
00:54:25,891 --> 00:54:28,977
How frightening
when it's our own flesh.

581
00:54:29,019 --> 00:54:31,396
Woman: No!

582
00:54:31,438 --> 00:54:32,981
No, stop.

583
00:54:33,023 --> 00:54:34,399
Graham:
Hold her still.

584
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:37,027
Woman: No.

585
00:54:37,069 --> 00:54:38,821
- Graham: Do it!
- Please, please.

586
00:54:40,155 --> 00:54:42,032
- l don't think your heart's in this.
- No. No.

587
00:54:42,074 --> 00:54:44,159
( screaming )

588
00:54:48,455 --> 00:54:50,624
( woman continues screaming )

589
00:54:59,216 --> 00:55:02,553
( Martin gasping, coughing )

590
00:55:09,434 --> 00:55:13,313
Come on.
Come on.

591
00:55:13,355 --> 00:55:15,732
l'm not afraid
of you anymore.

592
00:55:15,774 --> 00:55:18,193
This is my house.

593
00:55:18,235 --> 00:55:20,612
l'm not gonna be like you--
condemned.

594
00:55:20,654 --> 00:55:23,198
l'm fixing what you broke!

595
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:26,201
Go back to hell
where your bed is made.

596
00:55:26,243 --> 00:55:28,912
This is my house!

597
00:55:45,053 --> 00:55:47,055
( panting )

598
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,407
( panting )

599
00:56:12,706 --> 00:56:14,875
( hammer pounding )

600
00:56:20,631 --> 00:56:23,258
- My dad trusted me.
- Jonathan will too.

601
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,636
You just have to
give him a chance.

602
00:56:25,677 --> 00:56:28,013
Besides, it's not you
he doesn't trust.

603
00:56:28,055 --> 00:56:29,765
l can take care of myself.

604
00:56:29,806 --> 00:56:31,642
l know you can.

605
00:56:31,683 --> 00:56:33,852
He's just trying
to look out for you.

606
00:56:33,894 --> 00:56:36,021
Please.

607
00:56:37,397 --> 00:56:38,565
( sighs )

608
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:43,904
What's he got
against William anyway?

609
00:56:43,946 --> 00:56:47,658
Oh, we've known Billy
since he was this high.

610
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:51,078
He's had to deal with more
than his share of problems.

611
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:53,121
That's not his fault.

612
00:56:53,163 --> 00:56:56,375
l mean, l think it's wonderful
how he takes care of his father,

613
00:56:56,416 --> 00:56:59,670
especially after what happened
to his mother.

614
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:02,965
Well, she did that to herself.

615
00:57:03,006 --> 00:57:05,342
You can't give yourself
pneumonia.

616
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:09,346
She didn't die of pneumonia.

617
00:57:09,346 --> 00:57:13,976
Billy's mother--
she killed herself.

618
00:57:14,017 --> 00:57:16,687
What?

619
00:57:16,728 --> 00:57:20,357
Hung herself in the garage.

620
00:57:24,611 --> 00:57:27,656
Billy was the one
who found her.

621
00:57:27,698 --> 00:57:30,576
lt was really hard on him.

622
00:57:30,617 --> 00:57:33,579
The doctors put him
on all sorts of medication.

623
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:36,915
He's gotten in a lot of trouble
around town.

624
00:57:36,957 --> 00:57:40,210
l think Jonathan's just afraid
he's a little unstable.

625
00:57:40,252 --> 00:57:42,921
And his father-- well--

626
00:57:42,963 --> 00:57:44,464
Where are you going?

627
00:57:44,506 --> 00:57:46,633
l need to sort things out
in my head.

628
00:57:48,635 --> 00:57:50,637
Hey, Allison,
you want to play a game?

629
00:57:50,679 --> 00:57:52,681
Maybe later, okay?

630
00:57:52,723 --> 00:57:55,184
Where are you going?

631
00:58:31,094 --> 00:58:32,262
Hello?

632
00:58:36,808 --> 00:58:39,019
No, wait.

633
00:59:36,493 --> 00:59:38,495
( flies buzzing )

634
00:59:59,266 --> 01:00:01,310
Hello?

635
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:23,081
Hey, are you okay?

636
01:00:24,124 --> 01:00:26,126
Wait.

637
01:00:52,486 --> 01:00:54,988
Are you okay?

638
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,283
Are you in trouble?

639
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:16,552
What are you doing down here?

640
01:01:25,644 --> 01:01:27,521
Are you in here?

641
01:01:50,252 --> 01:01:52,546
( quietly )
Oh my God.

642
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:41,011
Martin.

643
01:03:01,865 --> 01:03:03,909
( rattling )

644
01:03:57,921 --> 01:03:59,631
Where are you?

645
01:04:02,801 --> 01:04:04,553
( Allison gasps )

646
01:04:04,595 --> 01:04:05,971
Wait. Come back.

647
01:04:19,485 --> 01:04:21,862
l'm not going to hurt you.

648
01:04:21,904 --> 01:04:23,530
l want to help you.

649
01:04:27,534 --> 01:04:29,203
ls your name Martin?

650
01:04:30,662 --> 01:04:32,873
Here, come with me.

651
01:04:32,915 --> 01:04:36,502
You can't stay here.
lt's not safe.

652
01:04:36,543 --> 01:04:38,712
What's wrong?

653
01:04:38,754 --> 01:04:41,840
You don't have to be afraid.

654
01:04:41,882 --> 01:04:43,884
You can trust me.

655
01:04:43,926 --> 01:04:45,802
You shouldn't be down here.

656
01:04:45,802 --> 01:04:49,890
( Allison screaming )
No! No!

657
01:04:49,932 --> 01:04:53,018
No! No! No!

658
01:04:54,019 --> 01:04:56,438
( panting )

659
01:05:03,779 --> 01:05:06,573
Good work.

660
01:05:12,496 --> 01:05:14,832
- l'm sure she's fine.
- How?

661
01:05:14,832 --> 01:05:17,251
She's just blowing off
some steam.

662
01:05:17,292 --> 01:05:20,003
No 17-year-old wants to be told
what to do.

663
01:05:25,092 --> 01:05:26,635
Not yet.

664
01:05:26,677 --> 01:05:29,847
l don't have any brothers or sisters
'cause Dad's lazy.

665
01:05:29,888 --> 01:05:32,850
And now he's
chased her away too.

666
01:05:32,850 --> 01:05:34,852
Way to go, Dad.

667
01:05:56,498 --> 01:05:58,667
( rat squeaking )

668

( screaming )

669
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:04,381
( screaming continues )

670
01:06:21,023 --> 01:06:23,442
( distant train horn blowing )

671
01:06:31,575 --> 01:06:33,160
She never came home
last night.

672
01:06:33,202 --> 01:06:36,121
l know.

673
01:06:36,163 --> 01:06:37,331
Where are you going?

674
01:06:37,372 --> 01:06:40,209
l'm gonna go find her.

675
01:06:45,255 --> 01:06:47,007
l need to speak to Allison.

676
01:06:47,049 --> 01:06:48,425
She's not here.

677
01:06:48,425 --> 01:06:50,636
lt's important.

678
01:06:50,677 --> 01:06:53,680
- She isn't here, Billy.
- We thought she was with you.

679
01:06:53,722 --> 01:06:56,099
No. She's been gone all night?

680
01:06:56,141 --> 01:06:57,643
Since yesterday.

681
01:06:57,684 --> 01:06:59,603
This is your goddamn fault.

682
01:06:59,645 --> 01:07:02,606
- Stop. Jonathan.
- Stay the hell away from her.

683
01:07:02,648 --> 01:07:03,816
- Jonathan.
- Don't push me.

684
01:07:03,857 --> 01:07:06,068
- Jonathan.
- You're no good.

685
01:07:06,109 --> 01:07:07,986
You're just like your old man--

686
01:07:08,028 --> 01:07:09,738
good for nothing.

687
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:12,366
lt's okay.

688
01:07:12,407 --> 01:07:15,035
Stay away from my niece!

689
01:07:15,077 --> 01:07:17,496
Come on.
Are you all right?

690
01:08:26,565 --> 01:08:28,901
( Allison whimpering )

691
01:08:41,205 --> 01:08:43,582
Please.

692
01:08:45,125 --> 01:08:47,503
lf they have no feelings,

693
01:08:47,544 --> 01:08:49,963
they can't know fear.

694
01:08:52,007 --> 01:08:54,801
But if they can't know fear...

695
01:08:54,843 --> 01:08:57,221
( Allison panting )

696
01:08:57,221 --> 01:08:59,640
then why do they run?

697
01:09:13,737 --> 01:09:16,073
Anybody home?

698
01:09:20,994 --> 01:09:22,538
Please don't.

699
01:09:28,627 --> 01:09:30,045
Sutter!

( muffled screams )

707
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:12,629
Who's there?

708
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:15,757
lt's Jonathan Miller.

709
01:10:15,799 --> 01:10:17,718
l'm looking for my niece.

710
01:10:17,759 --> 01:10:20,262
She didn't come home
last night.

711
01:10:20,304 --> 01:10:22,431
l've been looking
all over for her.

712
01:10:22,473 --> 01:10:24,850
l thought she might have wandered
over here. Have you seen her?

713
01:10:24,892 --> 01:10:26,643
No.

714
01:10:28,395 --> 01:10:33,317
Listen, do you have a young boy
living over here?

715
01:10:33,358 --> 01:10:36,320
She said she saw a boy
running around over here.

716
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,280
Just get off my property.

717
01:10:40,324 --> 01:10:41,825
You mind if l come in
a moment?

718
01:10:41,867 --> 01:10:43,118
l'm busy.

719
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:45,162
Just a moment.

720
01:10:46,205 --> 01:10:48,415
Just a second.

721
01:10:50,083 --> 01:10:52,085
Uncle J!

722
01:10:52,127 --> 01:10:54,171
Allison?

723
01:11:16,693 --> 01:11:19,321
Uncle J!

724
01:11:24,117 --> 01:11:26,119
What did you do?

725
01:11:26,161 --> 01:11:28,664
You girls, you--

726
01:11:28,705 --> 01:11:31,458
you never can keep
your mouths shut.

727

735
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,457

Leave me alone!

736

738
01:13:30,410 --> 01:13:32,454
William: Hello?

739
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:37,751
Allison?

740
01:13:37,793 --> 01:13:40,170
Mr. Miller?

741
01:13:45,592 --> 01:13:47,803

Allison?

746
01:14:44,067 --> 01:14:45,861
( screaming )

747
01:14:56,413 --> 01:14:59,166
Oh my God. Martin!

754
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:27,569

l can't hear you.

758
01:15:57,432 --> 01:15:59,935
William, open the door.

759
01:15:59,977 --> 01:16:02,646

760
01:16:12,364 --> 01:16:13,907
William:

761
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:17,536

l don't care.

774
01:18:01,598 --> 01:18:03,934
Let them find out.

775
01:18:29,710 --> 01:18:31,962

You leave him alone.

He hasn't done anything.

780

No. No, l need him.

781
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:53,025
Who-- who-- who's gonna
help me clean up?

782
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:57,154
You know l can't stand it.

783
01:18:57,196 --> 01:18:59,990
No no no

01:19:00,032 --> 01:19:03,452
Shut up. Shut up!

785
01:19:03,494 --> 01:19:05,287
God!

786
01:19:05,329 --> 01:19:07,164
You're no better than he was!

787
01:19:41,198 --> 01:19:43,826
You promised me.

788

l did everything you said.

789
01:19:48,914 --> 01:19:52,209
( screams )

( sobbing )

791
01:20:07,307 --> 01:20:09,643
You win.

792
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:24,616
You're wrong.

793
01:20:24,658 --> 01:20:26,952
He wouldn't dare.

794
01:20:57,065 --> 01:20:59,943
Don't look at me like that.

795
01:20:59,985 --> 01:21:01,820
You don't ask why.

796
01:21:01,862 --> 01:21:04,573
You just do.

797
01:21:04,615 --> 01:21:06,909
That's just the way it is.

798
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:13,290
You think you owe me,

799
01:21:13,332 --> 01:21:17,419
think maybe l should grow eyes
in the back of my head?

800
01:21:17,461 --> 01:21:20,088
They abandoned you.

801
01:21:22,382 --> 01:21:24,802
What would you be
without me?

802
01:21:27,596 --> 01:21:29,598
You feel guilty or something?

803
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:33,101
Don't feel guilty.

804
01:21:33,143 --> 01:21:36,104
A child shouldn't feel guilty
about nothing.

805
01:21:45,197 --> 01:21:47,658
You--

806
01:21:47,699 --> 01:21:51,036
you don't feel anything, do you--

807
01:21:51,078 --> 01:21:53,747
guilt, pain, regret--

808
01:21:53,789 --> 01:21:57,876
nothing? Do you?

809
01:21:57,918 --> 01:22:01,171
Who are you to judge me?

810
01:22:14,852 --> 01:22:17,229
You have no soul to redeem.

811
01:22:19,398 --> 01:22:21,483
Do you?

812
01:22:30,617 --> 01:22:32,995
Don't try anything funny
while l'm gone.

813
01:22:33,036 --> 01:22:35,414
They're watching.

814
01:23:56,328 --> 01:23:58,372
( grunting )

815
01:24:17,808 --> 01:24:19,768
( panting )

816
01:24:47,671 --> 01:24:49,631
Oh my God.

817
01:24:49,673 --> 01:24:51,758
What did he do to you?

818
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:54,470
Come on. l'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

819
01:24:54,511 --> 01:24:55,804
l'm sorry.

820
01:25:10,027 --> 01:25:12,029
Are you okay?

821
01:25:13,405 --> 01:25:15,407
Come on.

822
01:25:17,242 --> 01:25:20,162
Come on. lt's okay.
Trust me, okay?

823
01:25:31,965 --> 01:25:35,010
Come on, l can't carry you.

824
01:25:36,595 --> 01:25:39,348
ls this what you're scared of?

825
01:25:39,389 --> 01:25:43,018
This thing?

826
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:46,939
You see? lt's nothing.

827
01:25:59,076 --> 01:26:01,036
When are they coming home?

828
01:26:01,078 --> 01:26:02,579
Soon.

829
01:26:17,302 --> 01:26:19,471
( panting, grunting )

830
01:26:44,121 --> 01:26:46,456
( knocks on door )

831
01:26:46,498 --> 01:26:48,000
Finally.

832
01:27:01,138 --> 01:27:03,432
Yes?

833
01:27:04,433 --> 01:27:07,102
- ( screams )
- Wendy, run.

834
01:27:07,144 --> 01:27:09,938
Mommy!
( screaming )

835
01:27:12,691 --> 01:27:14,401
Mommy.

836

837

840
01:27:38,133 --> 01:27:40,135

why they run...

921
01:36:38,715 --> 01:36:40,926
that even a dumb animal

922

knows when it's been betrayed.

923

Do you feel betrayed?

No.

925

That's why you didn't run.
