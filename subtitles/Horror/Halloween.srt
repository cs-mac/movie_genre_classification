Michael loves animals. He--

141
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:13,814
Why would he do this?

142
00:07:13,882 --> 00:07:19,377
Mrs. Myers, typically the thrill of hurting
or causing pain to smaller creatures,

143
00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:21,889
it's often an early warning sign.

144
00:07:21,957 --> 00:07:23,515
Early warning sign for what?

145
00:07:26,161 --> 00:07:28,356
For much deeper and bigger problems.

146
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,762
[Mrs. Myers] What do you mean problems?

but what does--

151
00:07:42,144 --> 00:07:43,873
what does evaluating him--
what does that mean?

152
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:48,042
[Loomis] Obviously, he's a very deranged
young mind that can do this to his pets.

Well, actually black isn't a color, is it?

It's the absence of color.

01:01:55,911 --> 01:01:57,742
I don't know.
It's kind of bumming me out.

805
01:02:00,215 --> 01:02:03,150
Fuck, dude, who put
all the empties back in here?

806
01:02:04,486 --> 01:02:05,817
You don't think that, do you?

807
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:07,150
Lynda, I don't think you're a slut.

808
01:02:07,222 --> 01:02:08,655
Come on, that's ridiculous.

809
01:02:08,724 --> 01:02:11,352
I don't give a shit what Annie thinks anyway.

810
01:02:11,426 --> 01:02:12,552
But I care what you think.

811
01:02:13,061 --> 01:02:14,688
Aww!

812
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:31,268
Fuck!

813
01:02:32,814 --> 01:02:34,281
What-- What the f--

814
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:20,551
Jesus, Bob, could you move
your pokey ass a little slower?

815
01:03:20,629 --> 01:03:21,960
Well, could you?

816
01:03:26,868 --> 01:03:28,267
Well, that's cute.

817
01:03:29,671 --> 01:03:32,504
See anything you like?

818
01:03:40,849 --> 01:03:42,510
Okay, enough.

819
01:03:42,584 --> 01:03:44,017
Joke's over.

820
01:03:44,086 --> 01:03:45,713
Beer, please.

821
01:03:50,525 --> 01:03:53,858
Hey, Casper the Friendly Asshole Ghost,
hand me my beer.

822
01:03:56,331 --> 01:03:58,458
Well, fucking hand it over, dip-shit.

823
01:04:01,436 --> 01:04:04,269
Why do you have to become
such a fucking jerk every time we do it?

824
01:04:04,339 --> 01:04:07,103
You think you'd be grateful
that I let you touch me with that thing.

825
01:04:07,175 --> 01:04:08,540
And anyway, you're not a zero.

826
01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:11,078
You're a fucking minus 5 or something.

827
01:04:11,146 --> 01:04:12,408
Whatever.

828
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:14,039
What'd you do to this beer?

829
01:04:51,791 --> 01:04:54,191
What about this big one here?
That looks perfect.

830
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:55,784
- You mean, like, this one here?
- Yeah, that one.

831
01:04:55,862 --> 01:04:58,763
- Yes, yes, that's lovely.
- .22 Smith & Wesson.

832
01:04:58,832 --> 01:05:00,663
- That's good.
- Yeah.

833
01:05:00,734 --> 01:05:02,827
That's okay if you want to just piss it off.

834
01:05:02,902 --> 01:05:06,633
If you want to blow its fucking head off...

835
01:05:06,706 --> 01:05:08,003
this is what you want.

836
01:05:08,074 --> 01:05:09,939
.357 Magnum.

837
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:12,376
Wolff mainspring, polygonal rifling.

838
01:05:12,445 --> 01:05:13,912
Beautiful, beautiful.
Poly what?

839
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:16,710
- Muzzle velocity of 1,450 feet per second.
- Great, just wrap it up.

840
01:05:16,783 --> 01:05:18,114
- That's fine.
- Okay, okay.

841
01:05:18,184 --> 01:05:19,776
- Take it easy.
- Thank you. Yes.

842
01:05:19,853 --> 01:05:20,945
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

843
01:05:21,021 --> 01:05:22,511
If you could just wrap it up,
that'd be great.

844
01:05:22,589 --> 01:05:24,079
- Thank you.
- What are we hunting?

845
01:05:24,157 --> 01:05:28,218
- Girls, you look so beautiful.
- Little princesses.

846
01:05:28,294 --> 01:05:29,283
- Trick or treat.
- Here you go.

847
01:05:29,362 --> 01:05:30,386
- Thank you.
- Here's some candy.

848
01:05:30,463 --> 01:05:32,761
- Oh, Happy Halloween.
- You, too.

849
01:05:32,832 --> 01:05:35,494
- Bye, you guys.
- Thank you. Bye.

850
01:05:37,070 --> 01:05:38,867
So cute.

851
01:05:38,938 --> 01:05:41,532
I cannot believe you're graduating this year.

852
01:05:41,608 --> 01:05:44,338
I remember when you used
to run around looking like that.

853
01:05:44,411 --> 01:05:46,345
Mom, I was never a princess.

854
01:05:46,413 --> 01:05:48,677
Last thing I was at their age
was dead Little Red Riding Hood.

855
01:05:48,748 --> 01:05:50,045
You were this beautiful ballerina--

856
01:05:50,116 --> 01:05:52,880
No, you bought me the blood
and you gave me the cuts.

857
01:05:52,952 --> 01:05:54,317
"My costume's too tight."

858
01:05:54,387 --> 01:05:55,979
- You don't remember that?
- I never wore a tutu.

859
01:05:56,056 --> 01:05:57,785
You getting many kids?

860
01:05:57,857 --> 01:06:00,724
Only two so far.

861
01:06:00,794 --> 01:06:03,228
Listen...

862
01:06:03,296 --> 01:06:04,285
be careful tonight.

863
01:06:04,364 --> 01:06:05,353
I know.

864
01:06:05,432 --> 01:06:07,632
A lot of nut cases come out on Halloween.

865
01:06:07,708 --> 01:06:09,635
Dad, I'm just going to be babysitting.

866
01:06:09,710 --> 01:06:11,202
- What's the worst thing I could do?
- All right, okay.

867
01:06:11,279 --> 01:06:12,774
- I'm just saying.
- Nice.

868
01:06:12,847 --> 01:06:13,871
- All right.
- Sorry.

869
01:06:13,948 --> 01:06:15,506
- Aah!
- Mom, st--

870
01:06:19,787 --> 01:06:21,516
Hi, Mr. And Mrs. Strode!

871
01:06:21,589 --> 01:06:22,715
- Hey, Annie.
- Hey.

872
01:06:22,790 --> 01:06:23,848
How's your dad?

873
01:06:23,925 --> 01:06:26,519
Oh, you know, same as always.

874
01:06:26,594 --> 01:06:28,789
- You know what that means?
- Mm-hmm.

875
01:06:30,465 --> 01:06:31,932
Yeah. Love you guys!

876
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,332
- Love you, too!
- Bye-bye!

877
01:06:34,402 --> 01:06:35,664
Gonna give me some lovin'?

878
01:06:35,737 --> 01:06:40,037
I'll give you some lovin' later, but first
you're going to talk about the vacation.

879
01:06:40,108 --> 01:06:43,475
I'm going to go build a fire.

880
01:06:43,544 --> 01:06:45,239
Vacation.

881
01:06:45,313 --> 01:06:47,781
I hate vacation. Let's stay home.

882
01:07:20,148 --> 01:07:21,445
Aaahhh!

883
01:07:48,409 --> 01:07:50,400
No! No!

884
01:07:50,478 --> 01:07:53,743
You leave my baby alone, you--

885
01:08:07,161 --> 01:08:08,856
[crack]

886
01:08:10,381 --> 01:08:12,849
- Laurie?
- What?

887
01:08:12,817 --> 01:08:14,751
Is the Boogey Man real?

888
01:08:14,819 --> 01:08:17,117
Why are you so obsessed
with the Boogey Man, Tommy?

889
01:08:17,188 --> 01:08:20,487
- Well, I hear things at school.
- Like what?

890
01:08:20,558 --> 01:08:23,288
Well, I heard that on Halloween night,

891
01:08:23,361 --> 01:08:26,819
the Boogey Man sneaks out
and attacks kids who don't believe.

892
01:08:28,666 --> 01:08:30,691
You know what, Tommy?

893
01:08:30,768 --> 01:08:32,736
It is true.

894
01:08:32,804 --> 01:08:35,466
He likes to eat little boys like you.

895
01:08:37,542 --> 01:08:39,134
Oh, my God!
The Boogey Man's here!

896
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:40,905
We're going to die!

897
01:08:40,979 --> 01:08:42,310
[Telephone rings]

898
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:43,938
Hold that thought.

899
01:08:44,015 --> 01:08:46,210
That's not appropriate
babysitter behavior, Laurie.

900
01:08:46,284 --> 01:08:47,512
Hello?

901
01:08:48,219 --> 01:08:49,652
<i>[Laurie]
Shut up.</i>

902
01:08:49,721 --> 01:08:52,554
<i>- My parents will hear about this one.
- Yo, it's me. Hey.</i>

903
01:08:52,624 --> 01:08:54,922
So the Wallaces are finally out of my face.

904
01:08:54,993 --> 01:08:56,585
I just talked to Paul.
He's on his way over.

905
01:08:56,661 --> 01:09:02,156
So I'm finishing making the Queen of Sheba
her popcorn, and then I will be over.

906
01:09:02,233 --> 01:09:05,361
I have some fun and exciting news for you,
so I'll see you in a few minutes.

907
01:09:05,436 --> 01:09:06,869
Okay, bye.

908
01:09:08,606 --> 01:09:10,938
- Guess what, Tommy.
- What?

909
01:09:11,009 --> 01:09:13,500
Lindsey Wallace is coming over.

910
01:09:13,578 --> 01:09:15,603
What? She can't come over here!

911
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:18,478
- What if the guys see her?
- So?

912
01:09:18,549 --> 01:09:20,016
One, she's a girl.

913
01:09:20,084 --> 01:09:22,211
Two, she's not a boy.

914
01:09:22,287 --> 01:09:23,948
And three, she smells like you.

915
01:09:24,022 --> 01:09:27,423
This is going to be a long night.

916
01:09:27,492 --> 01:09:28,823
For the both of us.

917
01:09:51,057 --> 01:09:53,855
Lindsey... get your coat on.

918
01:09:53,927 --> 01:09:55,861
We're going to go over
and see Tommy Doyal.

919
01:09:55,929 --> 01:09:57,692
Okay.

920
01:10:05,171 --> 01:10:08,106
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

921
01:10:08,174 --> 01:10:10,506
Yeah, exactly.
I said get your coat on.

922
01:10:10,577 --> 01:10:14,638
We're going over to your late-night lover
Tommy Doyal's house.

923
01:10:14,714 --> 01:10:15,840
No, you didn't.

924
01:10:15,915 --> 01:10:17,177
Yes, I did.

925
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:19,241
No, you didn't.

926
01:10:19,319 --> 01:10:23,756
Don, I'm sorry if I don't
sound too concerned,

927
01:10:23,823 --> 01:10:27,919
but a dead coyote and a missing headstone
doesn't prove anything.

928
01:10:27,994 --> 01:10:29,018
Well, I think you're wrong, Sheriff.

929
01:10:29,095 --> 01:10:31,791
I think it does prove
that he's here in Haddonfield.

930
01:10:31,865 --> 01:10:34,425
It was a Halloween prank.

931
01:10:34,501 --> 01:10:36,799
Kids pull shit like that all the time.

932
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:38,394
The stone will be returned tomorrow.

933
01:10:38,471 --> 01:10:40,530
And besides, it weighs over half a ton.

934
01:10:40,607 --> 01:10:43,075
That's my point exactly.

935
01:10:43,142 --> 01:10:47,078
So you're saying that one man picked it up
and walked away with it?

936
01:10:47,146 --> 01:10:48,272
Yes.

937
01:10:48,348 --> 01:10:51,044
Doc, I may have been born,
but I wasn't born yesterday.

938
01:10:51,117 --> 01:10:54,382
I'm sorry, Sheriff,
but please listen to me.

939
01:10:54,454 --> 01:10:56,684
This may be a matter of life and death.

940
01:10:56,756 --> 01:10:59,884
All right, I'll tell you what I'll do.

941
01:10:59,959 --> 01:11:01,756
You come by my office tomorrow--

942
01:11:01,828 --> 01:11:04,262
Tomorrow is too late.

943
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:06,594
Evil is here.

944
01:11:06,666 --> 01:11:08,497
It's walking amongst us.

945
01:11:08,568 --> 01:11:11,560
Doc, it sounds to me like
you're talking about the Antichrist.

946
01:11:11,638 --> 01:11:14,198
Well, perhaps I am.

947
01:11:14,274 --> 01:11:15,263
Smell my feet

948
01:11:15,341 --> 01:11:17,002
Give me something good to eat

949
01:11:17,076 --> 01:11:18,873
If you don't, I don't care

950
01:11:18,945 --> 01:11:20,879
I'll pull down Annie's underwear

951
01:11:20,947 --> 01:11:24,075
I can't believe you're making me
haul this thing all the way over there.

952
01:11:24,150 --> 01:11:27,586
I can't believe you think
I'm not going to tell.

953
01:11:28,688 --> 01:11:31,521
Gonna share some popcorn
with your little boyfriend?

954
01:11:31,591 --> 01:11:33,456
No, I'm not.

955
01:11:33,526 --> 01:11:35,050
You know you are.

956
01:11:35,128 --> 01:11:37,790
You know you're going
to share something with Paul.

957
01:11:37,864 --> 01:11:40,059
You know how annoying you are?

958
01:11:40,133 --> 01:11:41,998
How?

959
01:11:42,068 --> 01:11:44,127
Trick or treat, smell my feet.

960
01:11:44,203 --> 01:11:45,932
Give me something good to eat

961
01:11:46,005 --> 01:11:48,997
- If you don't, I don't care--
- I swear to God, Lindsey.
