00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,959
- Don't you look at television?
BOTTOMLY: Can't. It hurts my eyes.

307
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,511
Do you know I actually see that
electronic beam scanning the tube?

308
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,752
- What about the stranglings?
- They keep happening.

309
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,229
Of course, compulsive homicide,
inner-motivated.

310
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,709
- You only catch them by fluke.
- Not good enough.

311
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,509
Fortunately, you have four police
departments to absorb public criticism.

312
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,911
- Commonwealth can stay out of it.
- I don't intend for that.

313
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,718
There's an absolutely urgent need
to coordinate the investigations.

314
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,473
We've got to do it.

315
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,632
But what part do you want me to play
in this, Ed?

316
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,915
I want you to coordinate the
investigations for the commonwealth.

317
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,638
Set up a Strangler Bureau.

318
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,478
No.

319
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,471
This is not a favor I'm asking...

320
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,871
...and the budget hasn't any money
to pay you for it, but...

321
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,953
...I'm putting it to you as I see it:
public service.

322
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,156
BOTTOMLY:
I teach law. I write about law.

323
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,596
My practice has almost disappeared
while I've been working with you.

324
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,309
That's my public service.
I'm not even remotely qualified for this.

325
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,597
You have one of the best minds I know.
You're highly respected.

326
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,110
You're a uniquely competent
administrator.

327
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,874
In spite of that scholarly pose,
you're tough enough.

328
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,395
Forgetting all that,
I'm against it on principle.

329
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,791
- You want the stranglings to go on?
- That's not fair.

330
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,394
I don't want to throw out the baby
with the bath.

331
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,916
The more centralized police authority
becomes, the less I like it.

332
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,435
- Spoken like a scholar.
- Which is what I hope I am.

333
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,397
God sits on your shoulder, doesn't he?

334
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,196
That's a regional and ethnic disability
I inherit from my ancestors.

335
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,598
Well, shall we have some more tea?

336
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,636
BETTY: It's so cold outside.
CONNIE: It sure is.

337
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,395
BETTY: My hands are frozen.
I can hardly move my fingers.

338
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,198
CONNIE:
I just hope it doesn't snow again.

339
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,237
I hope not either.
Ruin the weekend.

340
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,073
That'll probably be ruined anyway.

341
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,435
I can't reach my keys.
Are yours handy?

342
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,955
Yes, I have them
in my pocket someplace.

343
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,315
Boy, these packages are heavy.

344
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,870
She's got it double-locked again.

345
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,838
She must have stepped out
to get the steak.

346
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,831
That butcher likes her.

347
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,275
I can understand
while she's in the house...

348
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,874
...but when she goes
for the mail or the garbage?

349
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,952
He's only interested
in old ladies anyway.

350
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,712
NEWSCASTER:
The Strangler's seventh victim...

351
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:39,671
...Liza Gordon, was young,
unlike the others, who were old...

352
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:45,470
...Negro, unlike the others,
who were white...

353
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,273
...and living with two other girls...

354
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,070
...unlike the others, who lived alone.

355
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,278
From now on,
no woman in greater Boston...

356
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,197
...regardless of who she is
or how she lives, can feel secure.

357
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,393
Let's go to the statehouse,
where Mr. John Bottomly...

358
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,313
...head of the newly-created
Strangler Bureau...

359
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,959
...is setting up headquarters.

360
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,954
Mr. Bottomly?
How are you, sir?

361
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,031
Hello there, Mr. Dreier.

362
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,829
Mr. Bottomly, at this early stage
of the investigation...

363
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,150
...what will your first steps be?

364
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,710
Yes. Our first job is to copy the files
of each of the homicides...

365
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,031
...in each of the police departments
involved...

366
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,033
...Boston, Cambridge, Lynn,
Lawrence and Salem...

367
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,397
...and reconstruct them in master files
in these books here.

368
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,959
NEWSCASTER:
I see.

369
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,279
Mr. Bottomly...

370
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,831
Mr. Bottomly, is there any significance
to the fact...

371
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,639
...that half of that bulletin board
is empty?

372
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,351
A medical psychiatric board is
one of three divisions of this operation.

373
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,592
I've talked informally with its members.

374
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,072
And they feel chances are these killings
will continue until we find our man.

375
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,515
There's talk of finding
these demented people...

376
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,592
...and treating them before they
get to the point of killing.

377
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,231
- Now, do you have an opinion on that?
- A lot of talk is exactly what it is.

378
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,234
What more can you expect from
a society that itself spends 44%...

379
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,550
...of its tax dollar on killing?

380
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,838
- Anything else?
- Yes. Why did you take this on?

381
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,158
I was ordered to by my employer,
the attorney general.

382
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,676
NEWSCASTER: Ordered to, Mr. Bottomly?
- Don't you find that credible?

383
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,157
If you say so.

384
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,878
I'll amend it.

385
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,759
He challenged me
and I was sucked in.

386
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,559
NEWSCASTER: Thank you very much.
- Right.

387
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,635
Elsewhere in the nation on this day...

388
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,434
Miss Ridgeway owns the house
and rents rooms. Yankee family.

389
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,115
She lives with a lady, Alice Oakville.
They're married to each other.

390
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,875
The pigeon is a tenant named
Terence Huntley. He's a faggot.

391
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,519
I can't wait.

392
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,750
Good morning.
I'm Det. DiNatale.

393
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,115
Detective, I'm simply delighted
to meet you.

394
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,918
And this is Sgt. McAfee.

395
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,117
And this is my good friend,
Miss Oakville.

396
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,350
I'm not going to tell you anything first.

397
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,990
I want this to have the same effect
it had on me.

398
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,673
Alice, what did I say to you
the day Mr. Huntley hung that painting?

399
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,874
You said, "Alice, look at that.

400
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,110
You mark my words.

401
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,511
The next woman he strangles
is going to be a Negress."

402
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,070
That was the day before Liza Gordon
was strangled.

403
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,471
Did you have any reason to be suspicious
of Mr. Huntley previously?

404
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,112
Alice, tell the detective about seeing
Mr. Huntley on Gainsborough Street...

405
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,510
...where Mrs. Hodak lived.

406
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,631
I met him on Gainsborough Street...

407
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,633
...just three days before Mrs. Hodak
was strangled.

408
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:30,316
He was just staring into store windows
at those junk shops.

409
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,350
Isn't he an antique dealer?

410
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,272
What's that got to do with it?

411
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,194
Do all antique dealers
collect books like this?

412
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,511
The Collected Works
of the Marquis de Sade.

413
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:46,389
This and four others
about Thuggees.

414
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,993
I'm sure you understand
the significance of that.

415
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,478
Absolutely.

416
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,915
What's a Thuggee
and who is de Sade?

417
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:06,715
Thuggees are a sect of Indian ritual
murderers who strangle their victims.

418
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,589
The word "sadism"
comes from the Marquis de Sade.

419
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:15,151
All Terence Huntley is interested in
is strangling and torture.

420
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,232
[MUSIC PLAYING]

421
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,315
I've seen some put-ons,
but that one's carrying it too far.

422
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,633
She's coming this way.

423
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,830
- Are you Terence Huntley?
- I am.

424
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,719
John Bottomly. We've been
having trouble contacting you.

425
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,475
- I heard you were trying to reach me.
- The Bottomly in the Strangler Bureau?

426
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,993
That's right.

427
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,237
Terry, you hound. You've been
hiding your lamp under a blanket.

428
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,389
Bushel.

429
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,676
This is Cedric Ewing, Harold Robin.

430
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,479
- Very happy to meet you, Mr. Bottomly.
- How are you?

431
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,757
And very impressed.

432
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,912
Excuse us, we have a date
with a gunnery sergeant.

433
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,510
Why didn't you answer my calls?

434
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,875
I didn't know who you were
until just now.

435
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,508
I never answer calls
unless I know the people.

436
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,113
Why not?

437
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,837
Because I'm too vulnerable.

438
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,877
If you're rich and gay...

439
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:30,158
...people continually harass
and blackmail you.

440
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,957
BOTTOMLY: Have you any idea
why I want to talk to you?

441
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,116
Whenever there are unsolved sex crimes,
the police crack down on us.

442
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,633
I think it's ridiculous.

443
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,349
Be that as it may, we have an informant
who insists you're the Strangler.

444
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,268
Oh, my God. Miss Ridgeway.

445
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,193
Do you protect stoolies
even in this exotic atmosphere?

446
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,556
Every suspect
has to be checked out.

447
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,393
I thought you'd prefer me
to a detective.

448
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,676
The old school tie.

449
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,038
Or is it that you're really
a little curious about us?

450
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,031
Let's say I'm slumming.

451
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,158
I didn't think that you'd make a remark
like that.

452
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,950
I was rude. I'm sorry.

453
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,756
I believe you are.

454
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,117
What did you want to ask me?

455
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,797
Have you any business
on Gainsborough Street?

456
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,468

that 2600 police have come up with...

Rich and eccentric.

Look, I'd read the entrails of a crow
on the statehouse steps...

...if I thought we'd come up with
one lousy little clue.

622
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,758
This Mr. Chiari
has a cottage in Rockport...

623
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:16,469
...and Bobbie Eden was in Rockport
the night before she was killed.

- Absolutely.

"I prayed for a sign that I was right
in accusing Mr. Chiari...

...and last night it came.

628

I woke up, and a blue ball of fire
was flying through my room...

...writing the name Chiari
on the ceiling."

This came in yesterday
from a Catholic nursing school.

They got it from
a Eugene T. O'Rourke.

00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:46,233
"My reason for writing
is to say that I'm a bachelor...

if you could suggest a nurse...

as much as I'd like her...

that might lead to the altar."

- Very sad.

shoe store for groping a customer.

His landlady says he sleeps on
bed springs without a mattress.

Just the springs?

642

Some order of French Trappist monks

...threw him out for acting like a nut...

washing in the toilet, that kind of thing.

01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,919

and was in jail.

- Of course.

not help send him to the electric chair.

without legal risk to Albert?

You can't.

that anything I get out of him...

it was deceitfully exacted from Albert.

Oh, yeah, I like the feeling.
It's all right.

It's just scary. It's...

to confession when I was a kid.

I'd be walking toward the box,
feeling great...

1248
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:18,034
...because I was gonna tell the Father
what I did...

1249

01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:36,555
I could see it coming out of my head,
kind of floating out of the box.

1254

Then it'd be gone,
and I couldn't talk to him.

Will it make me feel better?

Do you promise
it'll make me feel better?

Of course it will.

BOTTOMLY:
What popped into your head?

1385
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:08,150
For a second, I...

1386
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:11,676
Well, not... No, no, not really me.
I mean, it was...

1387
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:14,716
Oh, it was...

1388
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:21,758
It was someone inside of me, wanted...
Didn't want her there.

1389
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:23,353
But...

1390
01:41:25,640 --> 01:41:30,395
Not me. Not... Not...
I mean, not me. I love Irmgard.

1391
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:35,510
BOTTOMLY: And you saw this other
person, this other you, going for her?

1392
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:39,874
- You told the doctor about this?
- No.

1393
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:41,473
BOTTOMLY:
You cut them off, don't you?

1394
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:43,995
Well, I don't... I don't know if I do.

1395
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:48,032
I try to. It...

1396
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:51,710
It, uh...

1397
01:41:54,160 --> 01:41:58,631
These things keep popping in and out
of my head, you know.

1398
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:01,476
They don't make sense.

1399
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:07,836
BOTTOMLY: Albert, do you remember
what you did New Year's Eve?

1400
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:10,511
New Year's Day?

1401
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:18,556
Yeah, I watched the Rose Bowl parade
with the kids.

1402
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:20,631
Then we had dinner around 2:00.

1403
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:22,518
We usually...

1404
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:26,357
...eat early on a holiday.

1405
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:29,473
BOTTOMLY: Remember what you did
the day after New Year's Day?

1406
01:42:29,640 --> 01:42:30,755
- I worked.
BOTTOMLY: Where?

1407
01:42:30,920 --> 01:42:32,831
On Charles Street. A furnace job.

1408
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:37,198
BOTTOMLY: What time did you quit?
- Oh, about 3:30 or so.

1409
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:38,713
What did you do then?

1410
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:40,479
Uh...

1411
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:41,909
Then I went home.

1412
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:49,436
- No?
- You sure you went home?

1413
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:53,553
But...

1414
01:42:55,320 --> 01:42:57,914
I don't know, man. I don't know.

1415
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:01,117
I don't know what's...
I don't know what's happening to me.

1416
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:05,034
BOTTOMLY: These things you see
that pop into your head...

1417
01:43:05,200 --> 01:43:07,395
...now is the time
to make sense out of them.

1418
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:10,791
DESALVO: I know, but what if...?
BOTTOMLY: You didn't go home.

1419
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:13,114
DESALVO:
Okay.

1420
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:14,879
If you say so.

1421
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:18,874
BOTTOMLY: What did you see
the other day when you felt sick in here?

1422
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:22,711
- I can't.
BOTTOMLY: You want to know?

1423
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,632
You want to feel better?

1424
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:27,349
Face it. What did you see?

1425
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:30,878
Uh...

1426
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:35,709
Mailboxes.

1427
01:43:35,880 --> 01:43:37,233
BOTTOMLY: Yours?
- No.

1428
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:39,038
BOTTOMLY:
What else?

1429
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:43,193
- A dark hall.
BOTTOMLY: What else?

1430
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:45,233
- I can't.
BOTTOMLY: Come on!

1431
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:46,549
I can't.

1432
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:54,269
- A woman's breasts.
BOTTOMLY: Whose?

1433
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:57,872
- I don't know. I can't see her face.
BOTTOMLY: What was she doing?

1434
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:03,034
Her blouse came off in my hand.

1435
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:08,399
BOTTOMLY: Albert, now.
Now is the time, Albert. Go back.

1436
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:13,513
You left the furnace job.
Now what do you do? Think.

1437
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:15,512
Reach out.

1438
01:44:17,240 --> 01:44:21,233
No, I can't. Nothing. No.

1439
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:25,156
BOTTOMLY: You don't want it to come.
- No.

1440
01:44:26,680 --> 01:44:29,035
- I'm trying.
BOTTOMLY: No, you're not. Face it.

1441
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:32,158
Where are you?
What did you do after you left the job?

1442
01:44:32,680 --> 01:44:36,275
Come on. Look at it.
Have some guts for once.

1443
01:45:08,440 --> 01:45:10,271
I'm, uh...

1444
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:14,749
- I'm going down the street.
BOTTOMLY: What?

1445
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:21,835
In a car, I'm going down the street.

1446
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,319
BOTTOMLY:
Where are you going?

1447
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:28,879
Anywhere. I just...

1448
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:31,994
...find a place to park the car.

1449
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:37,912
Right. I parked the car...

1450
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:52,150
...and walked to the house
that was there.

1451
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:12,270
Miss McLean? Oh, Miss Williams.
I'm a plumber.

1452
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:16,399
The landlord sent me over
to check a leak in the walls.

1453
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:20,438
Well, I don't know
if I'll be back tomorrow.

1454
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:22,556
Well, okay. Right.

1455
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:26,390
Oh, fine. Great.

1456
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:45,438
Oh, yeah. I can see the leak.

Turn around and give me your hands.
