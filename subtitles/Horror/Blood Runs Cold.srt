1
00:02:13,826 --> 00:02:14,873
<i>Hello?</i>

2
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,578
<i>Hi, Winona. This is James.
How're you holding up?</i>

3
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:20,225
<i>Yeah, I'm still on the road.</i>

4
00:02:20,275 --> 00:02:21,796
<i>I've got a rough weather here</i>

5
00:02:21,797 --> 00:02:23,242
<i>but I'm fine now.</i>

6
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:24,514
<i>What about you?</i>

7
00:02:24,515 --> 00:02:26,522
<i>Well, I'm good, thank you.</i>

8
00:02:26,523 --> 00:02:29,000
<i>Hope you get there soon.
You'll love to make the bargain.</i>

9
00:02:29,523 --> 00:02:31,561
<i>But I wanted to check if you're still up for
the interview tommorow?</i>

10
00:02:31,562 --> 00:02:34,116
Look, I've been thinking and I...

11
00:02:34,117 --> 00:02:35,940
I want you to cancel it for me.

12
00:02:35,941 --> 00:02:36,861
<i>Come on, Winona.</i>

13
00:02:36,862 --> 00:02:39,506
<i>It'll will only take an hour.
It'll be fun</i>

14
00:02:39,507 --> 00:02:40,953
No, you listen to me now!

15
00:02:40,954 --> 00:02:42,698
You rent me a house and...

16
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:44,793
I'm going to stay there for two weeks.

17
00:02:44,794 --> 00:02:46,646
After that...

18
00:02:46,647 --> 00:02:48,196
You can schedule me on anything you want.

19
00:02:48,197 --> 00:02:49,472
<i>I know Winona but...</i>

20
00:02:49,473 --> 00:02:51,137
<i>I'll always help you when you get here.</i>

21
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:53,296
I'm going to hang up now.

22
00:02:53,297 --> 00:02:55,225
<i>- Talk to you later.
- Wait just one second Winona...</i>

23
00:02:55,226 --> 00:02:57,426
Bye!

24
00:03:23,976 --> 00:03:26,101
<i>The calculated route contains one or
more unsurfaced roads.</i>

25
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:28,671
<i>Perform a U-turn when possible.</i>

26
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,359
And how am I supposed to get in
without a key?

27
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:55,453
Hello?

28
00:04:56,585 --> 00:04:58,785
Anybody?

29
00:04:59,524 --> 00:05:01,724
No?

30
00:05:17,552 --> 00:05:19,752
Cheap bastard.

31
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,200
Hello?

32
00:09:16,691 --> 00:09:18,891
Hello? Anyone?

33
00:11:43,048 --> 00:11:44,800
Hi there. What can I get you?

34
00:11:44,801 --> 00:11:45,957
Umm, white wine. Thanks!

35
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,714
Alright, anything to eat?

36
00:11:47,715 --> 00:11:49,979
No.

37
00:11:56,056 --> 00:11:58,256
Here you go.

38
00:12:10,051 --> 00:12:12,541
I was just sitting there in my office, right...

39
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:14,635
and this ugly fucker comes in.

40
00:12:14,636 --> 00:12:16,733
You know, with an attitude.

41
00:12:16,734 --> 00:12:18,786
And he starts telling me, you know, like...

42
00:12:18,787 --> 00:12:22,842
" I'm going to hold you personally responsible
for the damage to my car "

43
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:25,228
You know, a caveman.

44
00:12:25,773 --> 00:12:28,260
And you know I try to be diplomatic...

45
00:12:28,261 --> 00:12:30,503
...and tell him that's not really how it works.

46
00:12:31,555 --> 00:12:34,558
And I start telling him about our policy.

47
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:36,760
And he says..." You know you can take that policy..."

48
00:12:36,761 --> 00:12:38,812
"...and shove it up your ass."

49
00:12:38,813 --> 00:12:41,448
You know, pissed off as hell.

50
00:12:41,498 --> 00:12:43,732
- You know what I tell him?
- No, what did you say man?

51
00:12:43,733 --> 00:12:46,501
I said " That's a fucking excellent idea man! "

52
00:12:46,502 --> 00:12:50,166
So I jump up on the table,
I pull my pants down...

53
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:52,000
...and I held up all the papers
 like a holy scroll...

54
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:54,201
...and I said " Shove it up there! "

55
00:12:54,235 --> 00:12:56,218
" Come on big guy, you can do it! "

56
00:12:56,219 --> 00:12:58,402
You fucking didn't do that man...

57
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,186
I swear to God I did.

58
00:13:00,187 --> 00:13:01,970
No, he did not.

59
00:13:01,971 --> 00:13:03,029
You never believe me. I did.

60
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,890
Don't they fire you for saying that?

61
00:13:06,505 --> 00:13:09,257
That's not the point, Liz.

62
00:13:09,506 --> 00:13:11,633
Anyway, so...

63
00:13:11,634 --> 00:13:14,874
This guy flips off and he leaves.

64
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,467
You know the sad thing?

65
00:13:17,468 --> 00:13:22,021
That was the best moment
that I've ever had on that shitty job.

66
00:13:22,022 --> 00:13:23,574
I know, man.

67
00:13:23,575 --> 00:13:26,078
It sucks to be an ass kisser.

68
00:13:26,128 --> 00:13:27,679
All the time.

69
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,132
It does, but I mean you know...

70
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:33,137
Your best memories from the job
is not supposed to be some kind of...

71
00:13:33,138 --> 00:13:34,990
Hey Rick!

72
00:13:34,991 --> 00:13:38,231
Isn't that your ex-girlfriend?

73
00:13:39,058 --> 00:13:41,619
You know... who left you for a job.
What was her name?

74
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,820
Veronica?

75
00:13:44,793 --> 00:13:46,853
- It's Winona.
- Right...

76
00:13:46,854 --> 00:13:48,816
Yeah, Winona.

77
00:13:48,817 --> 00:13:51,017
You should go to her.

78
00:13:59,685 --> 00:14:02,642
He's going to put in some smooth moves!

79
00:14:02,643 --> 00:14:04,601
You should try that sometime.

80
00:14:04,602 --> 00:14:07,222
- Oh, what?
- What do you mean what?

81
00:14:07,223 --> 00:14:09,273
Oh, come on. You're pissed at me again
I can see that.

82
00:14:09,274 --> 00:14:11,285
- Yeah.
- What did I do?

83
00:14:11,286 --> 00:14:12,907
What did you do?

84
00:14:12,908 --> 00:14:14,919
You know what you did.

85
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,281
Oh, you think I flipped you off?

86
00:14:17,282 --> 00:14:19,042
Umm, yeah, you kind of did.

87
00:14:19,043 --> 00:14:21,243
Okay. I'm sorry.

88
00:14:21,305 --> 00:14:23,316
Please don't leave me!

89
00:14:23,317 --> 00:14:25,328
Take me back!

90
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:27,340
I promise to...

91
00:14:27,341 --> 00:14:29,351
improve.

92
00:14:29,352 --> 00:14:31,552
Come here, come on!

93
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,386
Hey, Winona!

94
00:14:35,387 --> 00:14:37,398
Hi! Rick!

95
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:41,421
- I didn't expect to see you here.
- I'm glad to see you again!

96
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:45,726
So, what are you doing here, you know
how are things going?

97
00:14:45,776 --> 00:14:47,765
I'm doing okay.

98
00:14:47,766 --> 00:14:50,892
so you're still working with your dad?

99
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:54,890
Yep. Still working with my dad...

100
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:58,163
Hey, I've read an interview with you in a magazine.

101
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:00,998
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah. It was...

102
00:15:01,048 --> 00:15:03,431
Oh, which one was it?

103
00:15:04,147 --> 00:15:06,261
Anyway I don't remember but...

104
00:15:06,262 --> 00:15:08,318
There was a great picture of you in it.

105
00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:10,519
Thanks.

106
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:13,143
So, do you want to drink or something?

107
00:15:13,144 --> 00:15:15,377
Yeah, sure.

108
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:25,102
I'm really happy to be able to work with
what I always wanted to do, you know?

109
00:15:25,103 --> 00:15:27,783
and I have a lot of people supporting me....

110
00:15:27,784 --> 00:15:29,997
even if sometimes...

111
00:15:29,998 --> 00:15:31,197
Well...

112
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:34,028
...you can't be too much.

113
00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:36,491
But let's not talk about me no more.

114
00:15:36,492 --> 00:15:37,750
What about you?

115
00:15:37,751 --> 00:15:38,507
Me?

116
00:15:38,508 --> 00:15:41,988
Yeah. There must've been some girls
since we were together...

117
00:15:41,989 --> 00:15:43,953
- Nah.
- Come on!

118
00:15:43,954 --> 00:15:47,087
No, I don't know about that.
You know how it is in this town.

119
00:15:47,088 --> 00:15:50,423
- Yeah, I know.
- Everybody knows everybody.

120
00:15:51,727 --> 00:15:53,628
It's just...

121
00:15:53,629 --> 00:15:58,009
You were always this great guy
taking care of everyone...

122
00:16:03,369 --> 00:16:05,569
to be honest...

123
00:16:07,224 --> 00:16:09,551
I really missed you.

124
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,752
Yeah? You have?

125
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:14,382
I'm here with Carl...

126
00:16:14,383 --> 00:16:17,528
...and his girlfriend Liz.
They're sitting over there.

127
00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:21,015
- I haven't seen him before.
- No.

128
00:16:21,016 --> 00:16:24,670
I've known him for a while
thru my dad's work.

129
00:16:24,671 --> 00:16:26,722
Big fucking udders, yeah big udders!

130
00:16:26,723 --> 00:16:29,963
Spring milk over everyone, you know...

131
00:16:30,729 --> 00:16:32,830
Carl seems like a real gentleman

132
00:16:32,831 --> 00:16:36,790
Yeah, I think he's like a dream.

133
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,545
So, how long are you planning to stay?

134
00:16:42,595 --> 00:16:45,455
- Hey man, you haven't introduced us yet.
- I'm sorry.

135
00:16:45,499 --> 00:16:48,402
- This is...
- Carl, Rick's best friend.
- Hi. Winona, nice to meet you.

136
00:16:48,403 --> 00:16:52,158
- and his girlfriend...
- Winona.
- Liz.

137
00:16:54,211 --> 00:16:57,063
So maybe we should leave
'cause this place sucks ass.

138
00:16:57,064 --> 00:17:00,344
- Where do you want to go, man?
- I don't know. Anywhere, man.
I don't give a shit.

139
00:17:00,345 --> 00:17:03,173
Well, I really don't know if there's anything open.

140
00:17:03,174 --> 00:17:05,475
Let's go to the party.

141
00:17:05,476 --> 00:17:06,629
Where the fuck do we go?

142
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,131
Do you have to swear all the time, Carl?

143
00:17:08,132 --> 00:17:09,882
Fuck you.

144
00:17:09,883 --> 00:17:11,634
I can call Tim and see what he's up to.

145
00:17:11,635 --> 00:17:13,486
No, don't call Tim.
He's boring as fuck.

146
00:17:13,487 --> 00:17:15,687
We can always go to my place

147
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,291
if you guys want to see a creepy old house.

148
00:17:18,292 --> 00:17:19,245
Are you kidding?

149
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,373
Fuck yeah, we do.
Rick, for real?

150
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,500
Yeah, it's really creepy.

151
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:27,306
- Okay. Awesome!
- Are you really sure about that?

152
00:17:27,356 --> 00:17:28,533
Oh, don't be such a drag.
Come on, it'll be fun.

153
00:17:28,534 --> 00:17:31,010
You know, we don't want to get
in your way and stuff.

154
00:17:31,011 --> 00:17:32,338
No. It'll be great!

155
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:34,566
Besides, I could use some company.

156
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:36,617
Yeah, you don't want to be alone
in that scary house.

157
00:17:36,618 --> 00:17:39,071
No, it is lonely, you can tell.

158
00:17:39,072 --> 00:17:41,123
Come on, seriously, let's go!

159
00:17:41,124 --> 00:17:43,324
Let's fucking leave.

160
00:17:58,901 --> 00:18:01,591
My manager rented me a place
to get away for a while.

161
00:18:01,592 --> 00:18:03,732
He said it'd be a good idea to

162
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:06,063
go back for a couple of weeks
to where I grew up.

163
00:18:07,013 --> 00:18:08,864
I don't remember being here before.

164
00:18:08,865 --> 00:18:11,717
Wait till you see the house!

165
00:18:11,718 --> 00:18:15,338
- It's so old and creepy and it's still in town.
- For real?

166
00:18:16,449 --> 00:18:19,025
Yeah, I was really surprised when I saw it.

167
00:18:19,026 --> 00:18:20,830
It's weird than most places.

168
00:18:20,831 --> 00:18:23,482
It can't be that bad if you have
the whole house to yourself.

169
00:18:23,483 --> 00:18:25,683
We'll see.

170
00:18:45,968 --> 00:18:48,819
Well, here we are.

171
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:52,220
This is nice and warm.

172
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:55,878
Wow, what a place!

173
00:18:57,278 --> 00:19:01,233
- Can you help me with some things in the kitchen?
- Yeah, sure.

174
00:19:01,234 --> 00:19:06,089
- Guys, make yourselves feel comfortable.
- Certainly, we'll try!

175
00:19:19,411 --> 00:19:23,981
- Liz, is this song okay?
- Yeah, sure.

176
00:19:24,615 --> 00:19:26,566
What a fucking house!

177
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:29,473
Look at this old stuff.

178
00:19:29,523 --> 00:19:32,425
Can you imagine living out here?

179
00:19:32,426 --> 00:19:36,182
Well, I can imagine making sex with you.

180
00:19:36,232 --> 00:19:38,884
- You're so funny!
- Yeah, I know. I'm fucking funny!

181
00:19:38,934 --> 00:19:41,134
Give me a kiss.

182
00:19:42,479 --> 00:19:46,044
So, what are you supposed to do out here?

183
00:19:46,045 --> 00:19:49,095
Didn't you hate the winter?

184
00:19:50,476 --> 00:19:54,191
Well, I know it sounds strange but
the house makes me relax when I'm here.

185
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,809
And I really need this.

186
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:59,263
Things have been a bit too much lately.

187
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:01,565
I'm thinking about moving away from here.

188
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:02,716
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

189
00:20:02,717 --> 00:20:04,168
What about your dad?

190
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:05,524
Is he going to be alright by himself?

191
00:20:05,525 --> 00:20:07,651
My dad?

192
00:20:07,652 --> 00:20:11,652
My dad is talking about retirement and

193
00:20:12,084 --> 00:20:15,436
I should move on as well, you know.

194
00:20:15,486 --> 00:20:17,341
I've got some friends in France

195
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:20,202
that want me to work with them.

196
00:20:20,245 --> 00:20:22,445
Really?

197
00:20:22,697 --> 00:20:26,887
Since when did you want to go to France?

198
00:21:22,528 --> 00:21:24,728
Thank you!

199
00:21:29,385 --> 00:21:31,487
Beers!

200
00:21:31,488 --> 00:21:33,390
- My God!
- No, save it.

201
00:21:33,391 --> 00:21:35,941
I thought I heard something strange there.
Was that you, Carl?

202
00:21:35,942 --> 00:21:38,395
You can't be in everything?

203
00:21:38,396 --> 00:21:41,251
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

204
00:21:47,709 --> 00:21:49,760
<i>- You know...</i>

205
00:21:49,761 --> 00:21:53,476
<i>- This place reminds me of your...
- Yeah, this is the best.</i>

206
00:22:05,836 --> 00:22:09,740
And the cop pulled me away and
I realized that I had a flat tire.

207
00:22:09,741 --> 00:22:12,293
<i>and I didn't have my spare tire with me 'cause...</i>

208
00:22:12,294 --> 00:22:15,059
- I'm going out for a little.
- Okay.

209
00:22:18,352 --> 00:22:21,592
<i>So anyways, it was freaking cold
and I had about six miles till...</i>

210
00:22:24,061 --> 00:22:26,111
I don't remember this.

211
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:29,116
Oh, Carl, it's getting pretty late and...

212
00:22:29,117 --> 00:22:33,711
I don't want to be boring but we should call and get a cab.

213
00:22:33,712 --> 00:22:35,651
You guys can crash here.

214
00:22:35,652 --> 00:22:37,442
<i>If you want.</i>

215
00:22:37,443 --> 00:22:40,503
<i>- Really?
- I have an extra bedroom upstairs.</i>

216
00:22:40,504 --> 00:22:43,314
Really? Awesome! Thank you.

217
00:22:43,315 --> 00:22:47,543
- Sweet.
- An extra bedroom. Did you hear that?

218
00:22:47,593 --> 00:22:52,047
I wonder what I could possibly
do to you up there.

219
00:23:07,229 --> 00:23:09,429
<i>Exactly!</i>

220
00:23:21,754 --> 00:23:23,676
Rick!

221
00:23:23,677 --> 00:23:27,772
- I need to talk to you.
- Yeah, coming.

222
00:23:33,707 --> 00:23:35,907
- Hey man.
- What's up buddy?

223
00:23:35,978 --> 00:23:40,208
So, Winona told us we could stay for the night.

224
00:23:40,209 --> 00:23:42,089
It makes me wonder...

225
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:44,086
...what are you going to do about it?

226
00:23:44,087 --> 00:23:47,680
Is that really such a good idea?
You know, you staying here?

227
00:23:47,681 --> 00:23:49,774
You've been together with her before, man.

228
00:23:49,775 --> 00:23:51,671
It shouldn't be too hard for you, man.

229
00:23:51,672 --> 00:23:53,418
Yeah, but... that was different, man.

230
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:54,566
Different how?

231
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:56,363
Did you tell her about the apartment?

232
00:23:56,364 --> 00:23:58,536
No!

233
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:03,403
It's different now, right?
You know, she broke up with me and...

234
00:24:03,404 --> 00:24:05,596
Let's just leave that behind, alright?

235
00:24:05,597 --> 00:24:09,401
Rick, the knight in shining fucking armor...

236
00:24:09,402 --> 00:24:10,804
Listen to me.

237
00:24:10,805 --> 00:24:13,607
Fuck France and all that shit.

238
00:24:13,608 --> 00:24:15,612
You are here now.

239
00:24:15,613 --> 00:24:18,415
The way I see it you really got a shot.

240
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:21,417
Don't ask me how man
but that's the way it seems.

241
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:24,173
The way I see it you've got three options.

242
00:24:24,174 --> 00:24:27,728
One... you can just lie on the couch
and masturbate.

243
00:24:27,729 --> 00:24:30,981
Or two... you can try and actually
get together with her again.

244
00:24:30,982 --> 00:24:35,387
Because it seems to me
she would actually like that.

245
00:24:36,137 --> 00:24:38,540
Well you know there's the third option
where you can join me and Liz ...

246
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:40,644
for a threesome.

247
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:41,497
You and Liz?

248
00:24:41,498 --> 00:24:44,738
Why not? We're open minded man!

249
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:48,205
- We all play sometimes.
- Do you?

250
00:24:48,255 --> 00:24:49,857
Well... yeah.

251
00:24:49,858 --> 00:24:51,509
We don't need to get into that.

252
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,511
The point is...

253
00:24:53,512 --> 00:24:55,615
Honestly, with Winona. Talk to her.

254
00:24:55,616 --> 00:24:56,969
I think you got a shot.

255
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,471
Take it.

256
00:25:04,277 --> 00:25:06,579
Good night, Rick.

257
00:25:13,882 --> 00:25:15,617
Rick.

258
00:25:15,618 --> 00:25:19,234
Whatever you may think about me...

259
00:25:19,235 --> 00:25:22,626
I'm glad that we ran into each other again.

260
00:25:22,627 --> 00:25:24,552
Yeah, me too.

261
00:25:24,553 --> 00:25:25,786
Look, uh...

262
00:25:25,787 --> 00:25:27,420
I'll sleep on the couch.

263
00:25:27,421 --> 00:25:29,621
Okay.

264
00:25:30,255 --> 00:25:32,756
But if you feel like it...

265
00:25:32,806 --> 00:25:35,307
you know where to find me.

266
00:25:35,357 --> 00:25:36,590
Good night, Richard.

267
00:25:36,591 --> 00:25:38,791
Good night.

268
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,334
How can it get so fucking cold?

269
00:31:38,925 --> 00:31:41,125
What the fuck.

270
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,168
What the fuck.

271
00:32:44,237 --> 00:32:45,237
Rick?

272
00:32:47,858 --> 00:32:49,158
Is that you?

273
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,950
Whatever...

274
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:19,778
What!

275
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:06,491
Carl?

276
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,846
Where are you?

277
00:35:25,721 --> 00:35:28,073
Carl, is that you?

278
00:35:31,078 --> 00:35:32,732
Hey come on...

279
00:35:32,733 --> 00:35:35,593
Stop fooling around. It's not funny.

280
00:35:38,988 --> 00:35:41,188
Carl?

281
00:36:13,121 --> 00:36:15,523
Rick! Winona!

282
00:36:29,436 --> 00:36:31,637
Come on, you motherfucker!

283
00:38:36,309 --> 00:38:38,561
Come on, buddy. Where are you?

284
00:44:47,087 --> 00:44:49,901
<i>Hope you like the house. Call me when you can,</i>

285
00:44:49,951 --> 00:44:52,857
<i>people have been asking about you
need to discuss things. Best - J</i>

286
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:34,192
Rick?

287
00:48:37,076 --> 00:48:39,276
Is that you?

288
00:50:33,136 --> 00:50:35,405
<i>I'm outside your house, just wanted
to drop off some stuff</i>

289
00:50:35,406 --> 00:50:38,931
<i>but I don't see your car anywhere,
where are you? - J</i>

290
00:57:27,943 --> 00:57:30,653
<i>Hi, this is Winona. Leave me a message
and I'll call you back.</i>

291
00:57:52,549 --> 00:57:55,353
<i>Hi Winona I have tried calling you many times,</i>

292
00:57:55,354 --> 00:57:56,853
<i>starting to get worried.</i>

293
00:57:56,854 --> 00:57:59,329
<i>Please call me back when you see this.
Best  - J</i>

294
01:02:18,412 --> 01:02:20,464
<i>- Did you find her?
- I was just down at the house.</i>

295
01:02:20,465 --> 01:02:23,114
<i>- Any call?
- No, I'm sure she's fine.</i>

296
01:02:23,115 --> 01:02:25,769
<i>- Did you talk to her?
- She just wants to be left alone.</i>

297
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:27,973
<i>- Yeah, if you say so...
- Listen...</i>

298
01:02:27,974 --> 01:02:29,924
I'm on the way back to the office.

299
01:02:29,925 --> 01:02:32,379
and we can...

300
01:02:32,429 --> 01:02:34,081
Hey, wait a second.

301
01:02:34,082 --> 01:02:36,562
<i>I'm gonna have to call you back.</i>

302
01:03:28,704 --> 01:03:30,904
Winona.

303
01:03:39,321 --> 01:03:41,521
Put it down!
