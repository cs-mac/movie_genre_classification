1
00:00:50,025 --> 00:00:51,332
- Hello?
- It's me.

2
00:00:51,497 --> 00:00:54,286
Oh, am I bothering you?
Francesco?

3
00:00:54,296 --> 00:00:57,625
No, don't worry, I had to get
out of the shower some time.

4
00:00:57,635 --> 00:00:59,294
Hold on a minute, Franco...

5
00:01:20,034 --> 00:01:21,493
You were saying, Franco?

6
00:01:21,612 --> 00:01:25,121
No, no, nothing. Just
calling to see how you doing.

7
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:27,330
You know how things are...

8
00:01:31,917 --> 00:01:33,457
...life goes on.

9
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:07,869
Gnaghi!

10
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:39,365
I've been shouting at
you for hours. Gnaghi!

11
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,265
He's Ghigini, the surveyor.

12
00:02:58,684 --> 00:03:01,183
- 12th row, 3rd grave, right?
- Gna.

13
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,866
Grave three.

14
00:03:17,535 --> 00:03:18,915
Here we go.

15
00:03:19,624 --> 00:03:21,543
I know you've heard this before,

16
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:22,963
but this time,

17
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,172
my dear Ghigini,

18
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,460
it is forever.

19
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,169
Rest in peace!

20
00:03:32,798 --> 00:03:34,467
Oh, my back...

21
00:03:43,643 --> 00:03:45,062
What a waste of good marble.

22
00:03:45,312 --> 00:03:46,650
Never looks right when you fix it.

23
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,740
All this fancy packaging.

24
00:03:48,779 --> 00:03:51,568
I don' know why they don't
just cover the graves with dirt.

25
00:04:41,793 --> 00:04:44,422
The gun! I forgot the fucking gun!

26
00:04:44,922 --> 00:04:47,881
- Ea...t!
- Gnaghi,

27
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,139
give me the spade! Gnaghi!

28
00:04:50,219 --> 00:04:51,928
give me the fucking spade!

29
00:05:03,902 --> 00:05:05,282
There we go.

30
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,119
You handle the rest Gnaghi.

31
00:05:11,948 --> 00:05:14,997
My name is Francesco Dellamorte.

32
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:16,536
Weird name, isn't it?

33
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,006
Francis Of Death.

34
00:05:18,295 --> 00:05:20,583
Saint Francis Of Death.

35
00:05:20,924 --> 00:05:23,003
I often thought of having it changed.

36
00:05:23,092 --> 00:05:26,131
Andrea Dellamorte would
be nicer, for example.

37
00:05:26,341 --> 00:05:29,051
I'm the watchman of
the Buffalora cemetery,

38
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,678
I don't know how the epidemic started,

39
00:05:31,768 --> 00:05:35,307
All I know is that some people,
on the 7th night after their death

40
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:37,186
come back to life.

41
00:05:37,276 --> 00:05:39,695
I call them "Returners",

42
00:05:40,195 --> 00:05:43,653
but frankly I can't understand
why they're so anxious to return.

43
00:05:43,782 --> 00:05:46,031
The only way to get rid
of them once and for all,

44
00:05:46,152 --> 00:05:47,951
is to split their heads open.

45
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,368
A spade will do it, but a
Dum-Dum bullet is best.

46
00:05:51,658 --> 00:05:53,538
Come and have a glass of wine.

47
00:05:56,587 --> 00:06:00,755
Is this the beginning of an invasion?
Does it happen in all cemeteries,

48
00:06:00,964 --> 00:06:03,672
or is Buffalora just an exception?

49
00:06:03,883 --> 00:06:07,551
Who knows? And in the end, who cares?

50
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:10,350
I'm just doing my job.

51
00:06:18,065 --> 00:06:21,404
Good morning engineer.
How are you doing today?

52
00:06:21,444 --> 00:06:23,823
Fine, Miss Chiaromondo. And you?

53
00:06:23,902 --> 00:06:25,782
The cemetery is open, isn't it?

54
00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:27,871
For you, any time.

55
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,328
Hello cutie. Here...

56
00:06:32,998 --> 00:06:34,747
How are you?

57
00:06:34,797 --> 00:06:38,176
He's happy. He likes
it when the sun shines.

58
00:06:44,262 --> 00:06:46,101
I'm not an engineer...

59
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,809
...and you are no cutie.

60
00:06:58,866 --> 00:07:02,284
Poor Gnaghi, on his ID card it reads:

61
00:07:02,324 --> 00:07:05,282
"Distinctive physical marks: all".

62
00:07:07,711 --> 00:07:09,870
He has a real passion for dead leaves,

63
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,789
can't stand it when the
wind blows them away...

64
00:07:14,377 --> 00:07:15,836
Oh well,

65
00:07:15,877 --> 00:07:19,385
we all do what we can
not to think about life.

66
00:08:34,258 --> 00:08:37,596
The most beautiful living
woman I have ever seen!

67
00:08:39,975 --> 00:08:41,974
Will I see her again?

68
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:14,428
I just came to water the flowers
on your poor father's grave.

69
00:09:16,808 --> 00:09:18,685
Husband.

70
00:09:23,274 --> 00:09:24,943
How long has he been dead?

71
00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:29,111
Two weeks.

72
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,200
- Thank goodness.
- What?

73
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:35,038
- I mean, I'm very sorry.
- Have you no respect for pain?

74
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,707
Well, you know how these
things are... You see:

75
00:09:37,117 --> 00:09:40,584
- in time, pain heals.
- It's not healing a bit.

76
00:09:45,382 --> 00:09:47,132
He was wonderful,

77
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,800
he was a wonderful lover, incredible,

78
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,549
tireless.

79
00:09:54,558 --> 00:09:56,847
He was fantastic!

80
00:10:26,052 --> 00:10:27,421
I messed it all up,

81
00:10:27,512 --> 00:10:28,971
I've lost her.

82
00:10:30,011 --> 00:10:32,179
Will I see her again?

83
00:10:42,104 --> 00:10:43,363
Hey, Franco!

84
00:10:48,361 --> 00:10:50,571
Franco is the only living person

85
00:10:50,621 --> 00:10:53,448
who even calls me. Now and
then I stop by his office

86
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:55,957
to remind myself what he looks like.

87
00:10:56,037 --> 00:10:58,296
You can't live on memories alone.

88
00:11:04,553 --> 00:11:06,382
It's for you. Sign as usual.

89
00:11:09,721 --> 00:11:12,889
- Have you got a pen?
- No.

90
00:11:12,979 --> 00:11:14,978
Hold on a sec, here we are.

91
00:11:20,276 --> 00:11:22,025
Have you had any visits last nights?

92
00:11:22,155 --> 00:11:23,733
A couple, yes.

93
00:11:26,322 --> 00:11:29,661
All this extra work! It's
much if the pay me any more.

94
00:11:29,871 --> 00:11:31,411
Tell the Mayor...

95
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,997
Oh, tell the Mayor then what?
They'd close the cemetery.

96
00:11:34,998 --> 00:11:36,957
Good-bye job and
good-bye house!

97
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:39,336
Come on, who do you
think would believe you?

98
00:11:39,426 --> 00:11:41,425
Listen, I don't care if
you don't believe me Franco,

99
00:11:41,506 --> 00:11:43,215
you're not the one who pays me!

100
00:11:43,265 --> 00:11:44,673
I believe you,

101
00:11:44,883 --> 00:11:47,093
I believe you, and you're right...

102
00:11:47,182 --> 00:11:49,061
- At least have him pay the overtime.
- Good.

103
00:11:49,181 --> 00:11:50,521
Well, let's go to the Mayor, then!

104
00:11:50,851 --> 00:11:52,191
It's not that easy.

105
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,108
First you have to fill out an M3 form,

106
00:11:55,187 --> 00:11:58,026
report with an M3 form...

107
00:11:58,107 --> 00:11:59,616
Forms...

108
00:12:00,446 --> 00:12:02,695
I could speed things up there for you...

109
00:12:03,034 --> 00:12:05,032
It's easier just to shoot them.

110
00:12:07,531 --> 00:12:09,791
One M3 form!

111
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,540
Going to get our willies wet tonight?

112
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,379
Some of us, yeah.

113
00:12:16,797 --> 00:12:19,386
Hell, at a certain point
in life, you realize

114
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:21,885
you know more dead people than living.

115
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:36,388
Sorry about the other day, I was
a bit crass. I didn't mean to be.

116
00:13:36,468 --> 00:13:38,757
My name's Francesco Dellamorte.

117
00:13:40,556 --> 00:13:42,394
You know, this is the
only job I could get

118
00:13:42,475 --> 00:13:45,014
even with a degree in biology.

119
00:13:47,233 --> 00:13:49,901
Anyway we all end up here
sooner or later, don't we?

120
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,569
I've got a great little
house... Want to see it?

121
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:57,737
I don't live alone, I've
got a helper, Gnaghi.

122
00:13:57,827 --> 00:14:00,035
He's a real conversationist!

123
00:14:02,534 --> 00:14:05,664
The cemetery's small, but
it's got a marvelous ossuary!

124
00:14:09,421 --> 00:14:11,091
An ossuary...

125
00:14:24,934 --> 00:14:27,772
I have never seen anything so...

126
00:14:27,863 --> 00:14:29,771
exciting!

127
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:31,031
Neither have I.

128
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:05,653
It's like in my dreams!

129
00:15:05,814 --> 00:15:07,733
This is my dream.

130
00:15:09,822 --> 00:15:12,200
I couldn't ask for anything more.

131
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,030
Me neither.

132
00:15:18,328 --> 00:15:22,205
You know, you've got
a real nice ossuary.

133
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:23,874
Thanks.

134
00:15:25,753 --> 00:15:28,463
You will allow me to return, won't you?

135
00:15:29,922 --> 00:15:32,510
You will allow me to kiss
you just once, won't you?

136
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:33,760
No.

137
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:35,978
Not like this.

138
00:15:42,944 --> 00:15:44,854
Like this.

139
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,228
I must be faithful to
the memory of my husband!

140
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:20,737
I can't. I can't!

141
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:24,774
It's not my fault... It's this place.

142
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:29,492
I feel strange tremors.

143
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:30,911
It's not the cold...

144
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:32,161
I'm not afraid...

145
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:36,168
This place wants me to...
It's forcing me to...

146
00:16:38,417 --> 00:16:39,167
I don't want to!

147
00:16:41,466 --> 00:16:43,136
I don't want to!

148
00:16:45,844 --> 00:16:48,552
I can't! I can't!

149
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,279
Don't be afraid, it's just ignis fatuus.

150
00:19:40,408 --> 00:19:41,666
Why here?

151
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,795
Why on your poor husband's grave?

152
00:19:45,415 --> 00:19:47,504
I've never kept anything from him...

153
00:19:47,624 --> 00:19:50,213
We trusted each other implicitly.

154
00:19:51,381 --> 00:19:53,261
He would have liked to know.

155
00:19:55,139 --> 00:19:58,059
Well, if that's the case...

156
00:20:07,194 --> 00:20:08,563
All these lights!

157
00:20:08,773 --> 00:20:10,232
Let them watch.

158
00:20:10,653 --> 00:20:13,991
What's better than watching
two lovers making love, hey?

159
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:19,328
Just to have a bit of privacy.

160
00:20:30,253 --> 00:20:33,800
Sorry, but the lady wants stars only.

161
00:22:04,526 --> 00:22:08,364
It's never been like
this before, with anybody.

162
00:22:08,613 --> 00:22:09,953
Only you.

163
00:22:10,243 --> 00:22:12,332
No one will ever make us part.

164
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:19,338
Gnaghi! The gun!

165
00:22:21,217 --> 00:22:22,047
I can explain! Listen to me,

166
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,056
you've always been so understanding!

167
00:22:25,516 --> 00:22:27,133
That's life!

168
00:22:48,823 --> 00:22:50,412
It's nothing my love,

169
00:22:50,533 --> 00:22:51,952
you're fine.

170
00:22:54,501 --> 00:22:55,631
Great,

171
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,290
just when I don't need it anymore.

172
00:22:57,999 --> 00:23:01,257
Well don't just stand there!
Go call doctor Vercesi!

173
00:23:02,427 --> 00:23:04,925
Go on, get the doctor!

174
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:07,514
Go on! Move!

175
00:23:08,134 --> 00:23:09,933
Nothing can separate us.

176
00:23:10,012 --> 00:23:12,432
I swear, nothing.

177
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:22,867
Nothing will separate us, will it?

178
00:23:23,446 --> 00:23:25,866
Nothing, my love. Nothing.

179
00:23:29,293 --> 00:23:32,122
Not even death?

180
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:34,001
Not even death.

181
00:24:11,122 --> 00:24:15,421
Dellamorte, are you
in there? Dellamorte!

182
00:24:28,774 --> 00:24:30,733
Jesus! You scared me to death!

183
00:24:30,854 --> 00:24:32,612
Were you looking for
me, Chief Straniero?

184
00:24:32,692 --> 00:24:35,320
Yes, Dr. Vercesi called.
What happened last night?

185
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:37,700
Well you know. Why are
you asking me? She's dead.

186
00:24:37,819 --> 00:24:38,869
I know she's dead,

187
00:24:38,949 --> 00:24:40,528
but how did that happen?

188
00:24:41,787 --> 00:24:43,116
Her husband.

189
00:24:43,456 --> 00:24:46,165
Sure! He came back from
the dead, he raped her,

190
00:24:46,295 --> 00:24:47,835
then bit her to death.
Is that what he did?

191
00:24:47,955 --> 00:24:49,504
No, he didn't rape her.

192
00:24:49,714 --> 00:24:52,212
Oh, you always crack me up, you know!

193
00:24:52,292 --> 00:24:54,301
Dr. Vercesi, are you spying on us?

194
00:24:54,381 --> 00:24:56,050
No, I dropped this certificate.

195
00:24:56,131 --> 00:24:59,309
Her heart stopped from fear, it
wasn't the bite that killed her.

196
00:24:59,389 --> 00:25:03,477
She died while making...
well you know... doing it.

197
00:25:04,306 --> 00:25:06,186
You know what that means, my boy?

198
00:25:06,315 --> 00:25:08,685
I'll have to look somewhere else
for the creep who killed her!

199
00:25:08,894 --> 00:25:11,193
- You are no longer a suspect.
- Why not?

200
00:25:11,483 --> 00:25:13,991
Well, you know what I mean.

201
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:15,990
Look, don't make me say it!

202
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,238
Go on, you can say it. I
don't mind, I'm impotent!

203
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:22,457
Don't use that word! A young
man like you, at your age...

204
00:25:22,498 --> 00:25:23,287
Did she have any relatives?

205
00:25:23,496 --> 00:25:25,795
No, no relatives, no friends.

206
00:25:28,165 --> 00:25:30,094
Well, I have to say that...

207
00:25:30,924 --> 00:25:32,173
Shit! This is definitely not my style!

208
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:38,599
- Can I keep her here?
- If you pay for the funeral, of course

209
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,389
you can do whatever
the hell you want with her.

210
00:25:40,598 --> 00:25:42,768
- Does that wrap it up, then?
- Yeah, except for a killer on the loose.

211
00:25:42,897 --> 00:25:44,855
Care to join me for a cup of tea?

212
00:25:46,235 --> 00:25:48,854
The weather's changing at last!

213
00:26:08,964 --> 00:26:11,133
I can't forgive myself
for having lied to you:

214
00:26:12,223 --> 00:26:14,591
I don't have a degree in biology,

215
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,810
I didn't even finish high school.

216
00:26:21,808 --> 00:26:25,027
I haven't read more than
two books in my whole life:

217
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:27,945
one,

218
00:26:28,904 --> 00:26:30,654
never finished,

219
00:26:32,743 --> 00:26:35,031
and the other is the phone book.

220
00:26:55,261 --> 00:26:57,430
I don't want her to become a Returner.

221
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,189
I don't want to see her again.

222
00:27:26,546 --> 00:27:27,885
No!

223
00:27:28,304 --> 00:27:30,094
Yes, my love!

224
00:27:31,473 --> 00:27:32,723
No, don't make me do it!

225
00:27:33,012 --> 00:27:35,311
But if you do it so well... so well!

226
00:27:36,981 --> 00:27:38,020
Not to you!

227
00:27:38,729 --> 00:27:40,938
It will be better with
me than with the others!

228
00:28:29,325 --> 00:28:30,283
Gna!

229
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,970
You do it!

230
00:28:41,838 --> 00:28:45,387
Well go on! If you finish
fast I'll buy you an ice-cream.

231
00:28:45,426 --> 00:28:46,556
Gna!

232
00:28:56,441 --> 00:28:58,320
- Here comes the Unforgiven.
- Who?

233
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,069
The Tombstone Mayor.

234
00:29:00,819 --> 00:29:04,577
The man whose dick's so
small he pees with tweezers.

235
00:29:07,826 --> 00:29:09,585
He could become a
woman. That'd solve it!

236
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:12,712
They are sewing them
back on in the States now.

237
00:29:13,002 --> 00:29:15,211
Yeah, they can stitch it right on,
if you've got one to start with.

238
00:29:15,501 --> 00:29:17,170
Forget it, I started that rumour.

239
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,260
The more they laugh, the
further away they seem.

240
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,758
You can never be too different, Gnaghi.

241
00:29:23,347 --> 00:29:24,927
Maybe you can.

242
00:29:25,016 --> 00:29:26,766
Engineer!

243
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:31,894
Engineer, engineer, come! Have a seat!

244
00:29:32,023 --> 00:29:35,111
Well well well, what a surprise!

245
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:38,990
Yes! It's a miracle
seeing you here, engineer!

246
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:41,699
It's a miracle seeing
you here, Mr. Mayor.

247
00:29:42,029 --> 00:29:46,286
So, how are things down at
our cemetery? How are things?

248
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,955
Well how do you think things are?

249
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:49,295
Population's shrinking.

250
00:29:49,415 --> 00:29:52,464
You're lucky, my dear engineer!

251
00:29:52,543 --> 00:29:55,800
You just can't imagine how
things are at the Town Hall.

252
00:29:55,801 --> 00:29:57,631
Now that the elections are upon us,

253
00:29:57,881 --> 00:30:00,470
it is chaos, right, inspector?

254
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:03,597
Yeah, it's a thrill for all,
nobody wants to lose their job.

255
00:30:03,637 --> 00:30:05,477
I was hoping for a New Deal...

256
00:30:05,557 --> 00:30:07,895
Daddy, what's this?

257
00:30:07,976 --> 00:30:10,565
This is my assistant Gnaghi.

258
00:30:16,112 --> 00:30:17,361
He's sweet!

259
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:19,320
Will you buy him, daddy?

260
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:24,157
That's great, it even knows how to cry!

261
00:30:24,327 --> 00:30:25,997
Gnaghi, don't stay so close to her.

262
00:30:26,126 --> 00:30:27,916
Could you move over, darling?

263
00:30:28,006 --> 00:30:29,875
Would you tell your
daughter to move over please?

264
00:30:29,915 --> 00:30:31,005
Yes of course.

265
00:30:31,124 --> 00:30:32,794
Sometimes Gnaghi gets a little bit excited...

266
00:30:32,923 --> 00:30:35,172
Oh, I'm sure he's
charming. Now, where was I?

267
00:30:41,349 --> 00:30:43,768
What's he doing? Dancing?

268
00:30:43,939 --> 00:30:46,356
No, no, he's just about to...

269
00:30:50,105 --> 00:30:51,864
What the hell are you doing Valentina?

270
00:30:52,114 --> 00:30:54,192
He threw up on me, Claudio!

271
00:30:54,193 --> 00:30:55,611
Oh, a new fact!

272
00:30:55,951 --> 00:30:57,620
Would you like to go for a ride?

273
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:00,329
I knew you'd understand!

274
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:02,409
Take off!

275
00:31:07,546 --> 00:31:09,924
By the way, one of these days

276
00:31:10,045 --> 00:31:12,004
I have to talk to you
about the cemetery.

277
00:31:12,844 --> 00:31:17,641
The youth of today...
They're so... emotional.

278
00:31:25,897 --> 00:31:27,646
Come on, Gnaghi! Get in, for God's sake!

279
00:31:27,736 --> 00:31:30,064
Don't do this, just get in the car!

280
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:33,153
It's not the end of the world,
It didn't even bother her!

281
00:31:33,284 --> 00:31:35,783
She understood it was just a
demonstration of your affection.

282
00:31:35,912 --> 00:31:39,750
Anyway, it's not the first time
you threw up over a woman, is it?

283
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:44,838
Come on, Gnaghi, get in!

284
00:31:46,757 --> 00:31:49,425
Look, first love doesn't count.

285
00:31:49,545 --> 00:31:51,634
It's last love that counts!

286
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:02,269
Nobody came today.

287
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:04,148
I was a bit bored,

288
00:32:04,358 --> 00:32:07,776
not even the admiral...
he's just disappeared!

289
00:32:07,866 --> 00:32:10,615
Let's hope tomorrow, okay?

290
00:32:10,694 --> 00:32:13,204
Yeah, come again and stay a while.

291
00:32:13,323 --> 00:32:17,912
Oh, he was such a
distinguished man, the admiral!

292
00:32:17,951 --> 00:32:21,379
Always used to bring me, always,

293
00:32:21,459 --> 00:32:24,588
a touch of Sambuca.

294
00:32:57,421 --> 00:32:59,500
Oh, come on Gnaghi!

295
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,589
You'll get over, you'll see!

296
00:33:04,758 --> 00:33:06,507
Time passes,

297
00:33:06,547 --> 00:33:08,176
nothing seems the same...

298
00:33:12,264 --> 00:33:14,103
It just gets worse.

299
00:33:14,853 --> 00:33:17,432
God, is it ever difficult
trying to make you feel better!

300
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:23,608
What were you doing with the Mayor's
daughter anyway? She's only a child!

301
00:33:24,448 --> 00:33:25,488
Gna!

302
00:33:27,987 --> 00:33:31,325
Oh yeah, that's not true,
you are not a child, Gnaghi.

303
00:33:31,454 --> 00:33:34,793
You're a year older than I am. Anyway...

304
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:37,372
One day,

305
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:39,461
you'll settle down with some...

306
00:33:39,881 --> 00:33:42,049
poor creature like yourself.

307
00:33:45,718 --> 00:33:47,467
In the meanwhile, why do you care?

308
00:33:47,806 --> 00:33:50,726
They all end up here
sooner or later, Gnaghi.

309
00:33:51,344 --> 00:33:53,564
Often sooner than later.

310
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:57,612
Faster, open it up!

311
00:33:59,691 --> 00:34:02,069
- If daddy could see us now!
- He'd kill me!

312
00:34:04,568 --> 00:34:05,827
Claudio!

313
00:34:05,947 --> 00:34:07,827
- Off we go!
- Go!

314
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:14,583
Go! Go!

315
00:34:15,542 --> 00:34:16,792
Go!

316
00:34:26,177 --> 00:34:28,596
- Hang on!
- Eat our dust!

317
00:34:45,577 --> 00:34:47,247
Four motorcycles racing...

318
00:34:47,457 --> 00:34:48,786
The Mayor's daughter is on one of them.

319
00:34:49,126 --> 00:34:50,875
Her head was sliced right off.

320
00:34:50,996 --> 00:34:52,665
They had to sew it back on the body.

321
00:34:52,795 --> 00:34:55,882
The bikes crashed into
a bus loaded with scouts

322
00:34:56,002 --> 00:34:59,050
on their way back from
a church-sponsored rally.

323
00:34:59,051 --> 00:35:00,880
Slaughter of the innocents!

324
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,969
And they were all so young.

325
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:07,267
They felt their life was ahead of them,
but in fact they were already passing by.

326
00:35:07,476 --> 00:35:09,146
Well, you've got your hands full!

327
00:35:09,186 --> 00:35:10,896
Oh, more than you know!

328
00:35:11,315 --> 00:35:14,064
Gnaghi, we're going to
need a lot of bullets.

Claudio! Take me with you!

334
00:35:35,423 --> 00:35:38,132
Don't leave me all alone, Claudio!

335
00:35:38,172 --> 00:35:40,091
Take me with you, my love!

336
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,430
Nasty tart!

337
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,348
My son wasn't with you!

338
00:35:45,439 --> 00:35:47,606
He was promised to the Mayor's daughter!

339
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:50,236
- But he loved me!
- Liar!

340
00:35:50,355 --> 00:35:52,854
He was mine, he loved me!

341
00:35:53,154 --> 00:35:56,282
- Only me!
- Have you no respect for a mother's pain?

342
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:58,781
We're born to die,

343
00:35:59,281 --> 00:36:01,370
born merely to die.

344
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:03,289
Do you remember?

345
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,829
Just yesterday,

346
00:36:04,959 --> 00:36:07,455
she was alive, happy.

347
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,296
Do you remember?

348
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:12,335
Dear Gnaghi even threw up on her,

349
00:36:12,465 --> 00:36:14,424
and she took it so well!

350
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,762
And now, she's gone...

351
00:36:17,881 --> 00:36:20,800
and right on the eve of the elections!

352
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:23,310
I better get the pickaxe and shovel.

353
00:36:23,889 --> 00:36:27,477
Pumpkin, how could you do this to me?

354
00:36:59,181 --> 00:37:01,269
Is it true as they say, that the
dead come back to life here at night?

355
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:02,600
Tell me the truth!

356
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:03,939
Hey! Who told you that?

357
00:37:04,149 --> 00:37:07,108
Is it true or not? Is it true or not?

358
00:37:07,277 --> 00:37:08,566
What if it is?

359
00:37:08,776 --> 00:37:11,365
I've got to see Claudio again!

360
00:37:11,445 --> 00:37:13,864
I have to know whether
he loved me or her!

361
00:37:13,944 --> 00:37:15,863
If I hear anything, I'll let you know.

362
00:37:16,913 --> 00:37:18,662
No, wait...

363
00:37:19,201 --> 00:37:21,460
Go away! I haven't got
time for the living!

364
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,670
Gnaghi?

365
00:38:47,927 --> 00:38:49,057
Gnaghi!

366
00:38:49,597 --> 00:38:52,595
Gnaghi, they came back
sooner than we thought!

367
00:38:53,554 --> 00:38:55,314
Gnaghi wake up!

368
00:39:14,914 --> 00:39:16,293
Gnaghi, watch out!

369
00:40:20,322 --> 00:40:21,151
Gnaghi,

370
00:40:21,651 --> 00:40:24,989
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

371
00:40:34,794 --> 00:40:36,673
Well, that's it, time's up and

372
00:40:36,793 --> 00:40:40,262
I want you upstairs and
ready in five minutes! Okay?

373
00:41:53,255 --> 00:41:55,004
Oh no, what's she doing here?

374
00:42:08,358 --> 00:42:09,527
Visiting hours are over!

375
00:42:09,687 --> 00:42:11,905
No one is going to
take me away from him!

376
00:42:15,654 --> 00:42:16,994
Quick, get the fuck over here! Quick!

377
00:42:18,033 --> 00:42:20,032
No, Claudio!

378
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:05,589
Claudio, take me with
you! Don't leave me!

379
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,088
Stupid cow!

380
00:43:11,966 --> 00:43:13,305
Come on!

381
00:43:18,353 --> 00:43:20,522
Wait! Wait!

382
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,189
Claudio please, take me with you!

383
00:43:27,399 --> 00:43:30,238
Tell me you only love me!

384
00:43:31,367 --> 00:43:32,946
Please...

385
00:43:49,298 --> 00:43:50,638
Claudio!

386
00:43:52,727 --> 00:43:55,344
You only love me, right?

387
00:44:20,922 --> 00:44:24,340
Damn! It always shoots to
the right when it's cold.

388
00:44:46,529 --> 00:44:47,778
Gnaghi!

389
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:30,577
No, please don't! He's only eating me!

390
00:45:31,077 --> 00:45:31,917
Move aside.

391
00:45:32,416 --> 00:45:35,755
Mind your business! I shall
be eaten by whoever I please!

392
00:45:35,836 --> 00:45:38,593
This is my business. They pay me for it.

393
00:45:52,016 --> 00:45:53,527
The living dead

394
00:45:53,686 --> 00:45:56,945
and the dying living are all the same.

395
00:45:56,985 --> 00:45:59,443
Cut from the same cloth.

396
00:45:59,943 --> 00:46:03,282
But disposing of dead
people is a public service,

397
00:46:03,361 --> 00:46:05,781
whereas you're in all sorts of trouble

398
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:09,038
if you kill someone
while they're still alive.

399
00:46:19,552 --> 00:46:20,723
Wait!

400
00:46:38,324 --> 00:46:40,532
This way they'll be together forever.

401
00:46:47,749 --> 00:46:49,497
I'm sentimental.

402
00:47:10,149 --> 00:47:11,936
Patience, Gnaghi.

403
00:47:12,027 --> 00:47:14,526
In love, it's the waiting
that's the best part.

404
00:47:15,985 --> 00:47:18,195
You have to learn how to wait.

405
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:39,834
- What's your name again?
- Gna!

406
00:48:39,953 --> 00:48:41,702
Gnaghi.

407
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:48,799
I'm Valentina.

408
00:48:49,638 --> 00:48:51,928
Haven't I seen you before?

409
00:48:53,387 --> 00:48:56,515
Oh yeah. Now I remember.

410
00:48:56,644 --> 00:48:59,014
You threw up on me. How sweet!

411
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:09,649
But I like shy boys.

412
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:12,658
And you never say no to a kiss.

413
00:49:12,737 --> 00:49:13,827
Take advantage.

414
00:49:14,666 --> 00:49:17,914
I'm certainly in no position
to refuse. Besides,

415
00:49:18,334 --> 00:49:19,754
I don't think I'd refuse anyway.

416
00:50:33,168 --> 00:50:34,746
False alarm!

417
00:50:35,917 --> 00:50:37,754
It was only a cat.

418
00:50:46,341 --> 00:50:49,348
No use you trying
to help me, little thing!

419
00:50:49,848 --> 00:50:52,268
If I can't do it, imagine you...

420
00:50:52,687 --> 00:50:55,396
Putting this skull together,

421
00:50:55,936 --> 00:50:58,854
is one of the most difficult
things in the world.

422
00:51:33,897 --> 00:51:36,275
You know, you really are
disgusting when you eat, Gnaghi.

423
00:51:39,376 --> 00:51:43,963
Yes, you're right. I suppose it all does
get mixed up in the stomach, in the end.

424
00:51:47,522 --> 00:51:48,861
What is it?

425
00:52:27,652 --> 00:52:29,401
That wasn't a cat!

426
00:54:14,768 --> 00:54:17,018
We can't!..I'm alive,

427
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:20,696
and you are dead.

428
00:54:21,445 --> 00:54:24,114
I'm not prejudiced, my love.

429
00:55:49,332 --> 00:55:51,131
I killed her!

430
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,129
Gna!

431
00:55:58,638 --> 00:56:00,387
I killed her!

432
00:56:08,733 --> 00:56:10,192
I killed her.

433
00:56:10,901 --> 00:56:15,068
The first time, when her husband
bit her, she wasn't really dead.

434
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:17,488
When she woke up, and I
shot her, she was alive.

435
00:56:18,828 --> 00:56:20,327
I killed her.

436
00:56:21,166 --> 00:56:23,954
I killed the only woman I ever loved.

437
00:56:24,164 --> 00:56:26,333
I shot her with my eyes closed,

438
00:56:26,453 --> 00:56:28,252
didn't aim for the head.

439
00:56:28,423 --> 00:56:30,342
That's why she came back.

440
00:56:30,841 --> 00:56:33,010
God, what an idiot!

441
00:56:34,089 --> 00:56:36,348
Now, I'm infected too.

442
00:56:36,598 --> 00:56:39,177
Will I be a Returner when I die?

443
00:56:40,097 --> 00:56:42,596
Who knows if Gnaghi...

444
00:56:42,855 --> 00:56:46,064
No, poor Gnaghi, he'd
never have the guts

445
00:56:46,103 --> 00:56:48,152
to crush my skull with a shovel.

446
00:56:50,232 --> 00:56:54,111
I'm not dead, you idiot!
A bite can't kill you!

447
00:56:59,706 --> 00:57:02,126
Good morning, engineer!

448
00:57:02,745 --> 00:57:05,124
Miss Chiaromondo, I'm not an engineer.

449
00:57:05,253 --> 00:57:08,463
Are you, or are you not
the watchman of the cemetery?

450
00:57:08,542 --> 00:57:10,132
Well, of course I am.

451
00:57:10,251 --> 00:57:13,390
You are therefore an engineer. By the way,

452
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:18,597
which of these do you think
would be better on my tombstone?

453
00:57:24,025 --> 00:57:25,394
Both.

454
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:29,732
I like the opinion of
a handsome young man.

455
00:57:29,822 --> 00:57:31,741
Good-bye, engineer.

456
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:40,167
- Gna!
- Good morning, cutie.

457
00:57:57,178 --> 00:57:59,187
But that's the phone book.

458
00:57:59,357 --> 00:58:01,026
Are you crazy?

459
00:58:01,437 --> 00:58:03,945
That is my favourite reading!

460
00:58:05,945 --> 00:58:07,943
Gnaghi, just because
we've got the new ones

461
00:58:08,033 --> 00:58:11,991
doesn't mean to say we have to throw the
old ones away. These books are classics!

462
00:58:17,209 --> 00:58:18,538
Gnaghi!

463
00:58:18,667 --> 00:58:20,127
Gna!

464
00:58:48,153 --> 00:58:51,072
Stop killing the dead.

465
00:58:51,411 --> 00:58:53,081
They're mine.

466
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:56,499
If you don't want the
dead coming back to life...

467
00:58:56,829 --> 00:58:59,956
why don't you just kill the living,

468
00:59:00,167 --> 00:59:01,336
shoot them in the head?

469
00:59:01,836 --> 00:59:04,135
Are you listening to me?

470
00:59:20,686 --> 00:59:22,776
- Hello?
- Greetings from the Tomb oft the Town Hall.

471
00:59:22,906 --> 00:59:24,575
- Franco! How are you?
- Bored.

472
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:26,444
Am I disturbing you?

473
00:59:26,654 --> 00:59:28,204
No, you never disturb me.

474
00:59:28,454 --> 00:59:31,041
Just called to talk about the scandal.

475
00:59:31,121 --> 00:59:33,201
- Gnaghi, the door!
- All that crap.

476
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:34,370
What did you say?

477
00:59:36,879 --> 00:59:38,549
What the hell was that?

478
00:59:38,758 --> 00:59:39,798
Nothing, I'm...

479
00:59:39,878 --> 00:59:41,256
- ...just working.
- What?

480
00:59:41,466 --> 00:59:44,295
You know, daily grind.
Nothing but the daily grind.

481
00:59:44,305 --> 00:59:46,884
You're telling me! Sometimes,
I feel like shooting myself.

482
00:59:49,063 --> 00:59:50,852
How's everything in your life?

483
00:59:50,971 --> 00:59:53,061
How are dear Mara and Cinzia?

484
00:59:55,979 --> 00:59:59,198
You know, sometimes I wonder
if they really exist, Franco.

485
01:00:03,365 --> 01:00:06,704
I mean, you do have a wife
and a daughter, don't you?

486
01:00:11,501 --> 01:00:16,709
I only ask 'cause... sometimes
I think you've made it all up.

487
01:00:24,765 --> 01:00:27,354
Franco, you do make me laugh!

488
01:00:32,021 --> 01:00:33,940
You'll get out one day.

489
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:38,708
Buffalora will be
nothing but a bad, bad memory.

490
01:00:38,958 --> 01:00:41,966
Yeah, or maybe not, if
only I could get unstuck...

491
01:00:42,047 --> 01:00:44,675
I feel like a fly on fly paper.

492
01:00:45,304 --> 01:00:47,053
You'll see, Franco...

493
01:00:49,262 --> 01:00:53,560
Mara is going to get tired of you,

494
01:00:54,809 --> 01:00:57,729
and Cinzia will grow up to hate you.

495
01:00:57,819 --> 01:00:59,697
Then you'll be free.

496
01:01:00,947 --> 01:01:04,285
Free to see what the rest
of the world looks like.

497
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:08,453
What do you think the rest
of the world looks like?

498
01:01:09,413 --> 01:01:11,252
- The rest of the world?
- Uh-uh.

499
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:17,509
Who knows if the rest of
the world even exists...

500
01:01:29,932 --> 01:01:30,853
Look who it is!

501
01:01:31,182 --> 01:01:32,522
Hey, Dellamorte, come here!

502
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:19,577
At times, I get ahead of my work.

503
01:02:20,488 --> 01:02:22,076
Work!

504
01:02:30,922 --> 01:02:32,501
Dellamorte!

505
01:02:36,339 --> 01:02:38,258
Dellamorte!

506
01:02:40,007 --> 01:02:41,597
Gnaghi!

507
01:02:49,403 --> 01:02:51,611
Francesco Dellamorte?

508
01:02:51,692 --> 01:02:55,240
Where were you between
11 and 12:30 last night?

509
01:02:55,531 --> 01:02:57,030
In bed.

510
01:02:57,738 --> 01:02:59,618
Any witnesses?

511
01:03:04,705 --> 01:03:08,713
I was talking to my friend Franco
on the telephone and I fell asleep.

512
01:03:09,003 --> 01:03:10,463
Why, what happened?

513
01:03:10,542 --> 01:03:13,381
Some fucking maniac
killed 7 people in town.

514
01:03:19,018 --> 01:03:20,808
More work.

515
01:03:21,387 --> 01:03:24,645
Well, you got to go to jail,
unless you have an alibi!

516
01:03:24,726 --> 01:03:26,225
Why me?

517
01:03:26,395 --> 01:03:30,903
Because your car was seen driving
around the streets last night, that's why.

518
01:03:32,072 --> 01:03:34,661
That's impossible, no one
can drive that wreck apart from me.

519
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:37,660
Actually, I don't think it was you.

520
01:03:37,779 --> 01:03:39,868
I think it was your assistant.

521
01:03:40,498 --> 01:03:42,916
Gnaghi can't even roller-skate!

522
01:03:43,086 --> 01:03:45,006
Neither can I, so what?

523
01:03:45,415 --> 01:03:47,795
I want to question him immediately.

524
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:00,727
God, the weather's gone bad.

525
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:13,861
Please,

526
01:04:14,491 --> 01:04:15,620
let me talk to him first.

527
01:04:15,741 --> 01:04:18,789
Just tell him to come
right out, will you?

528
01:04:23,796 --> 01:04:27,714
Don't you ever clean that
place? Jesus Christ, it stinks!

529
01:04:29,384 --> 01:04:33,891
♪ When all is sad, when you're
alone, it feels so bad.

530
01:04:33,931 --> 01:04:40,229
♪ You wait again for love to start,
to feel the beating of the heart. ♪

531
01:04:52,322 --> 01:04:54,410
Gnaghi!

532
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:57,330
Gnaghi, I had a terrible dream last night,

533
01:04:57,459 --> 01:05:00,588
I dreamt I went to town
and killed 7 real people.

534
01:05:00,798 --> 01:05:03,006
Hi, remember me?

535
01:05:03,417 --> 01:05:06,505
Dellamorte, you've
got important visitors!

536
01:05:12,051 --> 01:05:14,971
You'll understand, engineer, after this massacre,

537
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:16,640
the voters are furious with me.

538
01:05:17,899 --> 01:05:20,188
They've been voting
for you for 15 years.

539
01:05:20,398 --> 01:05:22,696
If I don't find this maniac, Straniero,

540
01:05:22,776 --> 01:05:24,856
there won't be a sixteenth.

541
01:05:26,775 --> 01:05:28,863
What's your daughter got to do with it?

542
01:05:28,864 --> 01:05:30,954
Now that the whole town is in mourning,

543
01:05:31,033 --> 01:05:34,371
I want to show them
that I'm grieving as well.

544
01:05:34,581 --> 01:05:37,210
I'll have some pictures
taken of the body

545
01:05:37,289 --> 01:05:40,128
and put a blow-up on
my election posters.

546
01:05:40,418 --> 01:05:42,297
And underneath, something like:

547
01:05:42,627 --> 01:05:45,425
"if you've had a death in the family,

548
01:05:45,715 --> 01:05:49,593
vote for someone who suffers like you."

549
01:05:49,633 --> 01:05:51,143
What do you think?

550
01:05:51,392 --> 01:05:54,181
Well, you know, it's a thought!

551
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,689
Or: "Vote

552
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:59,188
for a man who has lost

553
01:05:59,399 --> 01:06:02,658
all other happiness."

554
01:06:10,993 --> 01:06:13,162
Ready to shoot?

555
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:20,339
So what do I do? Take
one from the neck down?

556
01:06:20,589 --> 01:06:22,138
Engineer?

557
01:06:22,427 --> 01:06:24,426
What's the meaning of this?

558
01:06:26,095 --> 01:06:27,845
Daddy!

559
01:06:28,094 --> 01:06:29,644
Daddy kin!

560
01:06:29,854 --> 01:06:30,893
Did you hear that?

561
01:06:31,103 --> 01:06:32,983
I don't know. It depends...

562
01:06:33,102 --> 01:06:34,941
Daddy pie!

563
01:06:35,350 --> 01:06:37,359
Daddy pooh!

564
01:06:37,690 --> 01:06:39,239
Valentina!

565
01:06:39,529 --> 01:06:41,198
Pumpkin!

566
01:06:45,206 --> 01:06:46,864
The plot thickens!

567
01:06:46,955 --> 01:06:49,534
Pumpkin, where are you?

568
01:06:50,624 --> 01:06:52,373
Where are you?

569
01:06:54,252 --> 01:06:56,210
Your Daddy's here!

570
01:06:57,170 --> 01:06:58,719
Where are you?

571
01:06:58,969 --> 01:07:01,548
Stop blabbering and come on in!

572
01:07:06,475 --> 01:07:08,015
Coming.

573
01:07:12,732 --> 01:07:14,822
Here I am, little one.

574
01:07:17,609 --> 01:07:19,279
Jesus, it stinks in here!

575
01:07:19,489 --> 01:07:20,528
It's my fault, daddy!

576
01:07:22,618 --> 01:07:24,577
Oh my God, Valentina!

577
01:07:24,996 --> 01:07:27,204
What are you doing on TV?

578
01:07:27,244 --> 01:07:29,493
I'm rotting fast, Daddy!

579
01:07:29,584 --> 01:07:32,213
You, stuttering monster,

580
01:07:32,332 --> 01:07:34,292
you're the one who hurt my little girl!

581
01:07:34,501 --> 01:07:36,381
No, he loves me!

582
01:07:36,591 --> 01:07:38,169
Step aside!

583
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:39,848
I command you, as your Mayor!

584
01:07:39,928 --> 01:07:42,768
With your consent, I'd
like to marry Gnaghi.

585
01:07:44,436 --> 01:07:46,395
- This horrible thing?
- Gna!

586
01:07:47,016 --> 01:07:49,314
I'm not such a great
catch either, Daddy.

587
01:07:49,604 --> 01:07:52,522
Not as long, dear, as I've
got a breath in my body!

588
01:07:53,062 --> 01:07:56,191
Alright. We'll fix that right away!

589
01:08:11,423 --> 01:08:14,052
Help me, engineer!

590
01:08:14,131 --> 01:08:16,221
I'm not an engineer!

591
01:08:33,112 --> 01:08:34,652
I'm sorry Gnaghi,

592
01:08:35,071 --> 01:08:36,991
she really was beginning to...

593
01:08:37,070 --> 01:08:39,489
go off a bit on that, wasn't she?

594
01:08:46,166 --> 01:08:47,415
He's dead?

595
01:08:54,672 --> 01:08:55,841
He's dead.

596
01:08:56,181 --> 01:08:58,260
Who took a bite out of his neck?

597
01:08:58,350 --> 01:08:59,929
Well, not me or Gnaghi,

598
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:01,898
Take a mould of our teeth.

599
01:09:02,188 --> 01:09:03,557
You'll see they won't match.

600
01:09:03,766 --> 01:09:04,606
And who did it?

601
01:09:04,806 --> 01:09:08,026
Oh, relax Straniero. This won't be
your first unsolved case, will it?

602
01:09:09,614 --> 01:09:10,863
Hold it!

603
01:09:17,531 --> 01:09:19,200
Oh, come on, Gnaghi...

604
01:09:19,699 --> 01:09:23,037
The world's full of girls like
that, and they've got bodies, too.

605
01:09:25,876 --> 01:09:27,335
By the way,

606
01:09:27,626 --> 01:09:30,384
do you know what my
mother's maiden name was?

607
01:09:31,633 --> 01:09:33,722
You'd never believe it if I told you.

608
01:09:34,432 --> 01:09:37,140
She was called Dellamore.

609
01:09:37,221 --> 01:09:39,310
Dellamore.

610
01:09:40,389 --> 01:09:42,477
That means "love"...

611
01:09:43,817 --> 01:09:47,906
You're not the only person in the
world who's lost a lover, Gnaghi.

612
01:10:03,627 --> 01:10:05,007
Get down!

613
01:10:06,006 --> 01:10:07,796
What do you think? Get down from there!

614
01:10:07,925 --> 01:10:10,095
Forget it, engineer!

615
01:10:10,714 --> 01:10:12,383
Go home!

616
01:10:12,513 --> 01:10:14,052
You're supposed to be
setting a good example,

617
01:10:14,262 --> 01:10:16,680
now will you get back to
your coffin immediately!

618
01:10:16,771 --> 01:10:18,770
You can't stop me,

619
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:21,359
you owe your job to me.

620
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:24,697
- Remember?
- Get down or I'll shoot.

621
01:10:24,776 --> 01:10:26,356
You can't.

622
01:10:26,566 --> 01:10:28,775
I'm the Mayor!

623
01:10:29,075 --> 01:10:30,614
Ex!

624
01:10:48,385 --> 01:10:50,764
- Mr. Dellamorte?
- What?

625
01:10:50,884 --> 01:10:52,843
I'm Civardi, the new Mayor.

626
01:10:53,803 --> 01:10:55,471
Why the barbed wire?

627
01:10:55,641 --> 01:10:57,141
Do they climb in at night?

628
01:10:57,310 --> 01:10:59,730
No, they climb out, sometimes.

629
01:11:00,649 --> 01:11:02,318
Would you mind coming down?

630
01:11:03,148 --> 01:11:06,196
You reported an epidemic
which affects the dead.

631
01:11:06,905 --> 01:11:08,995
You claim they come to life

632
01:11:09,075 --> 01:11:11,324
within seven days of burial.

633
01:11:11,624 --> 01:11:16,211
- It says so, right here.
- An M3 report.

634
01:11:16,831 --> 01:11:18,420
- Didn’t you fill it out?
- No.

635
01:11:18,710 --> 01:11:21,209
Oh, splendid.

636
01:11:21,339 --> 01:11:24,257
So you'll provide us with a denial.

637
01:11:26,636 --> 01:11:28,515
Just sign here.

638
01:11:29,345 --> 01:11:31,104
Franco must have sent it.

639
01:11:31,224 --> 01:11:32,893
What a nice thought.

640
01:11:34,773 --> 01:11:36,650
Nothing happened.

641
01:11:37,690 --> 01:11:39,270
Nothing ever happens.

642
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:42,198
If the press got hold
of something like this,

643
01:11:42,279 --> 01:11:44,987
not only would Buffalora
be a laughing stock,

644
01:11:45,118 --> 01:11:47,695
but you'd lose your job.

645
01:11:48,745 --> 01:11:50,824
My personal secretary.

646
01:11:50,874 --> 01:11:53,123
- Mr. Dellamorte.
- A pleasure.

647
01:11:53,333 --> 01:11:54,873
A real pleasure, Mr. Dellamorte.

648
01:11:55,003 --> 01:11:56,382
Thank you.

649
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:59,170
You and I are going
to get along just fine.

650
01:11:59,710 --> 01:12:00,419
Good-bye.

651
01:12:10,015 --> 01:12:10,974
Your name!

652
01:12:11,564 --> 01:12:13,563
I didn't get your name...

653
01:12:29,075 --> 01:12:31,294
Will I see her again?

654
01:12:43,258 --> 01:12:45,057
Hi!

655
01:12:49,105 --> 01:12:50,685
I'm sorry.

656
01:12:52,144 --> 01:12:54,022
I didn't mean to frighten you, Miss.

657
01:12:55,483 --> 01:12:57,782
I was expecting someone else.

658
01:12:58,531 --> 01:13:01,739
Miss! Miss!

659
01:13:15,382 --> 01:13:17,301
Ever since I got to Buffalora,

660
01:13:17,382 --> 01:13:20,089
strange things have
been happening to me.

661
01:13:20,589 --> 01:13:22,808
It's as if I've been here before.

662
01:13:23,219 --> 01:13:24,887
And that grave...

663
01:13:25,228 --> 01:13:29,146
And you, Mr. Dellamorte, it's as if

664
01:13:29,226 --> 01:13:31,234
I've known you forever.

665
01:13:32,193 --> 01:13:34,613
As if I've loved you forever!

666
01:13:38,241 --> 01:13:39,571
You love me, too?

667
01:13:41,449 --> 01:13:42,498
Why?

668
01:13:42,619 --> 01:13:44,578
Who else is there?

669
01:13:48,046 --> 01:13:49,795
I love you as well.

670
01:13:50,964 --> 01:13:52,214
I love you.

671
01:13:57,841 --> 01:14:00,140
I've heard what they
say about you in town.

672
01:14:00,551 --> 01:14:02,428
Is it true that you don't...

673
01:14:02,509 --> 01:14:05,358
I mean, that you can't...

674
01:14:05,437 --> 01:14:07,776
No, you don't wanna
believe town gossip.

675
01:14:07,857 --> 01:14:11,105
Because I can only love an impotent man.

676
01:14:13,613 --> 01:14:16,112
Yeah, it's true. It's true.

677
01:14:16,202 --> 01:14:17,531
I like men...

678
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:23,078
but their manhood terrifies me.

679
01:14:24,118 --> 01:14:27,126
I can't stand the thought
of them having a...

680
01:14:27,547 --> 01:14:30,585
I mean... you understand?

681
01:14:32,544 --> 01:14:34,553
It's a sort of phobia I have.

682
01:14:35,093 --> 01:14:38,801
I don't have one, I don't
have anything at all.

683
01:14:39,551 --> 01:14:40,600
Will you marry me?

684
01:15:12,175 --> 01:15:14,093
I'm getting married!

685
01:15:14,173 --> 01:15:15,092
Gna!

686
01:15:16,682 --> 01:15:18,141
I'm really getting married!

687
01:15:18,351 --> 01:15:19,681
Don't pretend you
didn't hear everything.

688
01:15:19,931 --> 01:15:21,350
Gna!

689
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:23,149
Yeah? Why not?

690
01:15:23,270 --> 01:15:24,688
Go ahead, explain...

691
01:15:27,446 --> 01:15:29,405
God gracious...

692
01:15:29,526 --> 01:15:30,655
What are you saying?

693
01:15:30,785 --> 01:15:32,115
You heard me!

694
01:15:32,534 --> 01:15:34,074
My dear boy,

695
01:15:34,413 --> 01:15:38,701
you must be very run down.
I'm going to give you some pills.

696
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:43,049
Dr Vercesi, I'm serious.

697
01:15:43,799 --> 01:15:46,217
Look, I'm not going to be
intimidated in my own surgery.

698
01:15:46,377 --> 01:15:47,546
That waiting room there

699
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:50,256
is full of people with good,
honest diseases.

700
01:15:50,385 --> 01:15:51,305
I'll pay you...

701
01:15:53,724 --> 01:15:55,054
Yes I know, but...

702
01:15:56,812 --> 01:15:59,021
How can I? I mean,
everybody knows that...

703
01:15:59,561 --> 01:16:00,810
you haven't got one.

704
01:16:13,824 --> 01:16:18,501
I see. You have got one.

705
01:16:18,581 --> 01:16:22,500
When would you like me
to relieve you of your...

706
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,878
- ...problem?
- Now.

707
01:16:47,197 --> 01:16:49,486
What are you waiting
for? Get on with it!

708
01:17:02,419 --> 01:17:03,879
Now what?

709
01:17:11,185 --> 01:17:13,054
I told you I don't want an anesthetic.

710
01:17:13,144 --> 01:17:14,184
It's not an anesthetic.

711
01:17:14,394 --> 01:17:15,774
What is it, then?

712
01:17:16,603 --> 01:17:20,231
One shot of this, it'll be
as if you've never had one.

713
01:17:20,571 --> 01:17:22,449
It lasts for over a month.

714
01:17:22,989 --> 01:17:25,778
Look... please don't
make me cut it away.

715
01:17:25,908 --> 01:17:28,197
Today I'm just not up to it.

716
01:17:29,955 --> 01:17:31,835
What are you doing, turning over?

717
01:17:31,915 --> 01:17:33,494
I have to give you
the shot in the front.

718
01:17:33,834 --> 01:17:34,834
Front where?

719
01:17:35,664 --> 01:17:39,341
Hold still, I'll just make a puncture.

720
01:18:07,617 --> 01:18:09,707
That fucking butcher

721
01:18:09,996 --> 01:18:13,124
has given me some kind of infection.

722
01:18:14,374 --> 01:18:15,713
Gnaghi!

723
01:18:16,542 --> 01:18:19,302
I'm hovering between life and death.

724
01:18:19,341 --> 01:18:20,551
Gna!

725
01:18:21,470 --> 01:18:22,929
Yeah, you're right.

726
01:18:23,009 --> 01:18:25,218
I suppose I'm used to this condition.

727
01:18:28,767 --> 01:18:32,645
That's her. Don't let her
in. Tell her I'm not here.

728
01:18:32,734 --> 01:18:34,944
I don't want her to see me like this.

729
01:18:42,829 --> 01:18:44,908
- I must see Mr. Dellamorte.
- Gna!

730
01:18:45,039 --> 01:18:48,787
Please, I've got to speak
to him, is he in there?

731
01:18:50,666 --> 01:18:53,174
I'd give my life to be dead.

732
01:18:56,922 --> 01:18:58,472
Gnaghi!

733
01:18:58,592 --> 01:19:00,341
It doesn't hurt anymore.

734
01:19:00,761 --> 01:19:02,549
I think I'm better.

735
01:19:05,768 --> 01:19:06,938
Gna!

736
01:19:07,557 --> 01:19:08,897
When did t happen?

737
01:19:14,563 --> 01:19:16,113
She was our nicest client.

738
01:19:16,862 --> 01:19:18,952
The best always die first.

739
01:19:19,032 --> 01:19:20,201
Gna!

740
01:19:39,891 --> 01:19:42,890
Where have you been?
I thought I'd go mad.

741
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:45,398
If you only knew what happened to me.

742
01:19:45,519 --> 01:19:47,318
If you only knew what happened to me...

743
01:19:48,437 --> 01:19:50,606
I must talk to you.

744
01:19:54,193 --> 01:19:56,073
We'll always be together.

745
01:19:56,283 --> 01:19:58,162
Yes, my love, yes.

746
01:20:01,241 --> 01:20:03,749
I don't know how to say this, but

747
01:20:03,870 --> 01:20:06,588
- the Mayor raped me.
- No!

748
01:20:06,628 --> 01:20:09,586
Wait! I liked it.

749
01:20:09,676 --> 01:20:11,176
Not the violence, no.

750
01:20:11,466 --> 01:20:14,424
But after that, we did it again nicely,

751
01:20:14,425 --> 01:20:17,342
so that I'd forgive him.

752
01:20:18,053 --> 01:20:21,311
It was wonderful, do you understand?

753
01:20:21,390 --> 01:20:25,978
That means I'm cured. I
don't have a phobia anymore.

754
01:20:27,108 --> 01:20:29,317
I can't marry you, now.

755
01:20:31,735 --> 01:20:33,695
I'm going to marry him.

756
01:20:34,615 --> 01:20:37,032
That doesn't mean
anything though, I mean,

757
01:20:37,362 --> 01:20:40,661
nothing's changed
between us, I still love you.

758
01:20:41,121 --> 01:20:42,460
You know that.

759
01:20:43,210 --> 01:20:47,548
I just love you in a different
way, but you're important to me.

760
01:20:48,297 --> 01:20:52,056
He knows, I mean, about you and me.

761
01:20:52,596 --> 01:20:54,055
He's a wonderful man,

762
01:20:54,135 --> 01:20:56,223
he said he's happy we can be friends.

763
01:20:56,263 --> 01:20:58,392
We can still see each other.

764
01:20:58,722 --> 01:21:00,601
Nothing's changed.

765
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:03,610
Everything's just as it was.

766
01:21:05,899 --> 01:21:07,277
Everything.

767
01:21:26,879 --> 01:21:30,636
You look for Death in the clear night,

768
01:21:31,676 --> 01:21:34,185
you tell her you still love her,

769
01:21:34,894 --> 01:21:37,184
that you are her slave,

770
01:21:38,023 --> 01:21:40,231
that she's still your queen.

771
01:21:40,441 --> 01:21:42,521
Death, Death,

772
01:21:43,570 --> 01:21:45,649
Death, the whore.

773
01:21:57,953 --> 01:22:00,251
No, I'd only do it for the fear

774
01:22:01,081 --> 01:22:03,380
and I'd come back

775
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:06,509
just to experience the same fear again.

776
01:22:07,469 --> 01:22:09,137
To be afraid,

777
01:22:09,846 --> 01:22:12,425
always to be afraid.

778
01:22:20,481 --> 01:22:21,651
Hi!

779
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:26,659
Is that white VW outside yours?

780
01:22:29,327 --> 01:22:30,996
We're on foot.

781
01:22:31,406 --> 01:22:33,625
Could you give us a lift?

782
01:22:34,245 --> 01:22:35,584
It's not very far.

783
01:22:37,254 --> 01:22:39,043
Go on!

784
01:22:40,841 --> 01:22:41,961
I'm Magda.

785
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:47,099
And this is Laura.

786
01:22:54,684 --> 01:22:56,233
How far is it?

787
01:23:02,491 --> 01:23:05,199
This is where we live,
with another girlfriend.

788
01:23:13,795 --> 01:23:16,584
Do you want to come up for a drink?

789
01:23:17,294 --> 01:23:20,962
Come on, you're not afraid
of two college girls, are you?

790
01:23:24,849 --> 01:23:29,228
Make a wish. I grant wishes.

791
01:23:31,187 --> 01:23:33,265
I want you to fall in love with me.

792
01:23:39,323 --> 01:23:41,742
But I'm already in love with you.

793
01:23:42,031 --> 01:23:43,990
Haven't you noticed?

794
01:23:50,457 --> 01:23:52,545
It's cold in here.

795
01:23:55,794 --> 01:23:58,423
If you'd like to wash,
there's a sink there.

796
01:24:14,694 --> 01:24:17,273
I didn't mean your face, silly!

797
01:24:18,193 --> 01:24:20,822
I don't know whether I can do it.

798
01:24:20,952 --> 01:24:23,031
I've been taking some medication...

799
01:24:34,794 --> 01:24:37,513
I don't think your
medication is working!

800
01:24:52,816 --> 01:24:54,406
Do you love me?

801
01:24:56,694 --> 01:24:57,943
Yes,

802
01:24:58,243 --> 01:25:00,322
if you stay all night.

803
01:25:02,121 --> 01:25:04,201
All my life, too.

804
01:25:09,627 --> 01:25:12,837
- Come on!
- Let's rest a bit.

805
01:25:12,926 --> 01:25:14,636
- Why?
- You've come three times already.

806
01:25:14,846 --> 01:25:17,344
Twice. The third one was faked.

807
01:25:26,518 --> 01:25:28,688
She's sleeping, she's
been studying all day.

808
01:25:28,938 --> 01:25:31,027
she's got an exam tomorrow morning.

809
01:25:31,316 --> 01:25:34,446
I just wanted to get some wine.

810
01:25:34,486 --> 01:25:35,905
Sit down.

811
01:25:36,324 --> 01:25:37,863
I'll get you some.

812
01:25:54,255 --> 01:25:57,593
Did Laura tell you you can pay me?

813
01:25:58,223 --> 01:25:58,972
Pay you?

814
01:25:58,973 --> 01:26:01,272
School’s expensive, my friend.

815
01:26:03,021 --> 01:26:03,941
I have to pay you?

816
01:26:04,561 --> 01:26:06,150
We don't have a scholarship, you know.

817
01:26:08,028 --> 01:26:10,647
Besides, it's only 100,000 lira.

818
01:26:12,617 --> 01:26:14,495
She told me she loved me...

819
01:26:15,865 --> 01:26:17,953
That's 150,000.

820
01:26:18,452 --> 01:26:20,122
She wants me to stay the night.

821
01:26:20,752 --> 01:26:22,712
200,000.

822
01:26:23,171 --> 01:26:24,580
Is a cheque all right?

823
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:26,799
It's money, isn't it?

824
01:26:28,378 --> 01:26:30,258
Hurry, darling.

825
01:26:30,467 --> 01:26:32,636
I'm cold.

826
01:26:32,926 --> 01:26:35,015
Come and warm me up.

827
01:26:37,015 --> 01:26:39,853
I need your warmth.

828
01:26:40,772 --> 01:26:42,852
Warm me up.

829
01:26:43,561 --> 01:26:45,270
Coming, love.

830
01:26:50,027 --> 01:26:51,697
Now you'll be warm forever.

831
01:27:20,312 --> 01:27:22,482
This time I'm really through with love.

832
01:27:44,671 --> 01:27:48,009
I bet you'd like to know where I was
between 1 and 3 last night, wouldn't you?

833
01:27:48,099 --> 01:27:49,598
I know, I know.

834
01:27:49,929 --> 01:27:52,096
Here we are. Have no fear,

835
01:27:52,177 --> 01:27:53,766
I won't tell anybody about this cheque,

836
01:27:53,896 --> 01:27:55,765
this is the reason I came here.

837
01:27:56,065 --> 01:27:58,434
We're both worldly men, aren't we?

838
01:27:59,943 --> 01:28:02,441
- But this could be proof against...
- Proof against whom?

839
01:28:02,522 --> 01:28:04,610
We've already arrested
the guilty party.

840
01:28:04,690 --> 01:28:06,490
After setting fire to the apartment,

841
01:28:06,620 --> 01:28:08,579
he went home, killed
his wife and daughter,

842
01:28:08,699 --> 01:28:13,366
then turned himself in. He's at
the hospital, the psychiatric ward.

843
01:28:15,035 --> 01:28:17,754
Somebody's stolen my crimes!

844
01:28:29,559 --> 01:28:30,558
Sir?

845
01:28:31,518 --> 01:28:33,806
Excuse me, this section
is closed to the public.

846
01:28:33,895 --> 01:28:35,145
I've come to see the killer.

847
01:28:35,275 --> 01:28:37,774
But you can't go in
there. He's in a coma.

848
01:28:37,984 --> 01:28:39,854
He drank a whole bottle of iodine.

849
01:28:40,063 --> 01:28:42,153
I have to take his measurements.

850
01:28:44,651 --> 01:28:46,320
Franco!

851
01:28:51,118 --> 01:28:54,585
You looked a lot better the last
time we talked on the phone.

852
01:29:21,283 --> 01:29:22,402
Thief!

853
01:29:24,370 --> 01:29:26,160
You're a thief...

854
01:29:27,619 --> 01:29:31,706
You may have killed your wife and
daughter, OK, I'll give you that,

855
01:29:31,707 --> 01:29:33,797
but it was me who knocked
off the three girls.

856
01:29:33,877 --> 01:29:36,464
What are you doing stealing my murders?

857
01:29:36,585 --> 01:29:38,754
What kind of fucking
friend do you think you are?

858
01:29:40,134 --> 01:29:42,552
Especially as you thought
you were doing me a favour.

859
01:29:42,633 --> 01:29:44,432
Put that out immediately!

860
01:29:44,511 --> 01:29:45,640
- Smoking is not allowed in here!
- Shut up!

861
01:29:51,058 --> 01:29:53,566
He's in a coma. He doesn't even notice.

862
01:29:53,647 --> 01:29:55,236
Shit.

863
01:29:56,195 --> 01:29:57,734
What'd you say?

864
01:30:06,499 --> 01:30:09,248
Everything's shit.

865
01:30:09,329 --> 01:30:12,587
The only thing that's not shitty...

866
01:30:13,627 --> 01:30:15,506
is sleep.

867
01:30:15,586 --> 01:30:16,925
What are you doing on the floor, sister?

868
01:30:17,175 --> 01:30:18,174
She's praying.

869
01:30:18,594 --> 01:30:20,183
Friend of yours?

870
01:30:20,383 --> 01:30:24,062
Look, he hasn't got any relatives
and the coma he's in is irreversible.

871
01:30:24,141 --> 01:30:25,391
Give me a signature

872
01:30:25,681 --> 01:30:28,309
- and I'll pull the plug now.
- Fuck off!

873
01:30:43,741 --> 01:30:46,671
Here we go. Put it back in there.

874
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:49,459
I won't let you die

875
01:30:49,999 --> 01:30:52,298
until you give me an explanation.

876
01:30:53,337 --> 01:30:55,216
Why did you steal my murders?

877
01:30:58,224 --> 01:31:01,393
Don't you think anything
I do counts? Huh?

878
01:31:01,473 --> 01:31:03,062
Oh, my God! What happened?

879
01:31:03,352 --> 01:31:06,811
They killed each other. It
was a settling of scores.

880
01:31:07,730 --> 01:31:09,069
Don't you believe me?

881
01:31:09,318 --> 01:31:10,648
- No!
- Tough.

882
01:31:16,196 --> 01:31:17,825
So bad...

883
01:31:21,993 --> 01:31:23,582
So,

884
01:31:24,002 --> 01:31:27,250
is that all you have any need
to say to your only friend?

885
01:31:31,417 --> 01:31:33,177
Who are you?

886
01:31:33,597 --> 01:31:35,676
I don't know you.

887
01:31:35,886 --> 01:31:38,185
I don't know who you are.

888
01:31:38,385 --> 01:31:39,763
Go away.

889
01:31:41,103 --> 01:31:43,602
Go away!

890
01:31:59,454 --> 01:32:00,493
Dellamorte, wait.

891
01:32:01,043 --> 01:32:04,122
For God's sake, wait! There's
another maniac on the loose.

892
01:32:04,251 --> 01:32:06,131
He's on the 4th floor killing people.

893
01:32:06,341 --> 01:32:09,049
He already shot three.
You got a gun!

894
01:32:09,380 --> 01:32:11,338
That's good. Now you can defend yourself.

895
01:32:11,547 --> 01:32:14,806
Hey, take my advice and get
the hell out of here quick!

896
01:32:16,766 --> 01:32:18,145
Straniero!

897
01:32:18,305 --> 01:32:19,815
It was me!

898
01:33:13,907 --> 01:33:15,576
You and I are both the same.

899
01:33:17,875 --> 01:33:20,294
We kill out of indifference,

900
01:33:21,294 --> 01:33:23,381
out of love sometimes,

901
01:33:26,630 --> 01:33:28,719
but never out of hate.

902
01:33:34,976 --> 01:33:37,565
Now I don't know who's dead or alive.

903
01:33:38,814 --> 01:33:40,194
I'm sick of killing.

904
01:33:43,322 --> 01:33:46,320
So I'm leaving the game, brother.

905
01:33:47,820 --> 01:33:50,749
Dellamorte Dellamore

906
01:33:50,829 --> 01:33:53,118
bids you farewell

907
01:33:53,667 --> 01:33:55,915
and is on his way.

908
01:33:56,455 --> 01:33:58,255
Where to?

909
01:34:03,133 --> 01:34:05,511
Better get out of here.

910
01:34:05,841 --> 01:34:08,260
Even the statue's talking.

911
01:34:10,220 --> 01:34:12,728
Where do you think you're going?

912
01:34:12,769 --> 01:34:15,356
if you haven't yet
understood the difference

913
01:34:15,436 --> 01:34:18,145
between life and me.

914
01:34:31,498 --> 01:34:33,878
Gnaghi, you're not bringing that!

915
01:34:38,794 --> 01:34:41,633
That coffin is not coming with us!

916
01:35:18,005 --> 01:35:20,594
Yeah, I missed that one. Don't
worry, I'll get the next one.

917
01:35:21,014 --> 01:35:24,472
Oh calm down. I know
every bump on this road.

918
01:35:26,681 --> 01:35:28,350
There's one!

919
01:35:31,768 --> 01:35:33,108
Look!

920
01:35:35,607 --> 01:35:38,025
I'd never been this far.

921
01:35:39,904 --> 01:35:41,863
We made it, Gnaghi!

922
01:35:46,371 --> 01:35:48,660
Who could have imagined this?

923
01:35:48,790 --> 01:35:51,708
Wider than all the streets
of Buffalora put together.

924
01:35:52,208 --> 01:35:55,547
- It never seems to end!
- Gna!

925
01:35:57,296 --> 01:35:59,095
Hang on, Gnaghi.

926
01:35:59,804 --> 01:36:02,303
Past this tunnel is
the rest of the world.

927
01:36:12,229 --> 01:36:14,657
What do you think the rest of
the world looks like, Gnaghi?

928
01:36:15,368 --> 01:36:16,906
Can you imagine it?

929
01:36:22,164 --> 01:36:25,372
You're right. It's beyond imagination.

930
01:37:18,476 --> 01:37:20,315
I should have known it.

931
01:37:23,143 --> 01:37:25,232
The rest of the world doesn't exist.

932
01:37:36,576 --> 01:37:37,656
Gnaghi!

933
01:37:39,075 --> 01:37:41,495
Gnaghi, you weren't
hit that hard. Come on.

934
01:37:41,585 --> 01:37:43,793
Come on, I'll take you
to the car. Come on,

935
01:37:43,833 --> 01:37:45,332
Come on! Why are you going on
like this? You've just got cut.

936
01:37:45,592 --> 01:37:47,671
Come on man, get up,
I'll take you to the car!

937
01:37:47,841 --> 01:37:50,050
Come on! Come on, get up!

938
01:37:50,590 --> 01:37:52,838
What? What?

939
01:37:52,968 --> 01:37:54,217
Gnaghi!

940
01:37:57,766 --> 01:37:58,806
Gnaghi!

941
01:38:00,185 --> 01:38:04,233
Don't leave me alone
now. Gnaghi! Gnaghi!

942
01:38:07,361 --> 01:38:09,241
Oh God!

943
01:38:09,781 --> 01:38:10,610
Death,

944
01:38:11,030 --> 01:38:14,118
death, death comes sweeping down,

945
01:38:14,787 --> 01:38:17,576
filthy death the leering clown,

946
01:38:17,626 --> 01:38:20,505
death on wings, death by surprise,

947
01:38:20,625 --> 01:38:23,123
veiling evil from worldly eyes,

948
01:38:23,124 --> 01:38:24,792
death that's born

949
01:38:24,882 --> 01:38:27,381
as life succumbs, while death and love

950
01:38:27,461 --> 01:38:29,880
two kindred drums, beat the time

951
01:38:29,971 --> 01:38:31,759
till Judgement Day,

952
01:38:31,970 --> 01:38:33,019
an actor

953
01:38:33,058 --> 01:38:34,387
in a Passion Play,

954
01:38:34,478 --> 01:38:36,227
without beginning, without end,

955
01:38:37,056 --> 01:38:38,855
evermore.

956
01:38:39,066 --> 01:38:40,645
Amen.

957
01:39:05,841 --> 01:39:08,590
You're my best friend.

958
01:39:11,389 --> 01:39:14,099
I didn't even realise it.

959
01:40:04,784 --> 01:40:06,573
Could you take me home?

960
01:40:06,662 --> 01:40:08,241
Please.

961
01:40:12,289 --> 01:40:13,668
Gna.
