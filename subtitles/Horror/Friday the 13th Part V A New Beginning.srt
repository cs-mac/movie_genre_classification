CRYSTAL LAKE CAMPS

4
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,497
Come here. Come on now.

5
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:27,793
You are the last.

6
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,504
Killed all the others.

7
00:01:31,088 --> 00:01:33,965
It will be easier for you
of which was for Jason.

8
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:36,134
Why are you doing this?

9
00:01:36,343 --> 00:01:39,429
You must be punished
so did with it.

10
00:01:40,555 --> 00:01:44,984
You left him drowning.
Jason was my son.

11
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:52,516
No, no please.

12
00:01:52,692 --> 00:01:54,945
Should be taking care of him.

13
00:01:57,447 --> 00:01:59,157
It will be punished!

14
00:02:40,073 --> 00:02:41,616
Jason ...

15
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,995
... my special boy.

16
00:02:49,499 --> 00:02:51,542
They should be punished, Jason.

17
00:02:51,553 --> 00:02:54,921
So did you,
and that made me.

18
00:02:58,258 --> 00:03:00,093
Kill the Mother.

19
00:03:13,106 --> 00:03:15,691
CRYSTAL LAKE
THIS

20
00:03:19,905 --> 00:03:21,323
Really!
Careful ...

21
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,284
... with the lions of the mountains.
Has many here!

22
00:03:24,534 --> 00:03:26,995
Lions--the mountains?
--Yes, we have to make a bonfire ...

23
00:03:27,162 --> 00:03:28,997
... because they are afraid of fire.
--Shut up. You are talking nonsense.

24
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,508
Richie is talking crap!
Richie is talking crap!

25
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:34,127
--I am not talking nonsense.
--Are you too!

26
00:03:34,336 --> 00:03:37,005
Okay, you will see
when a show there ...

27
00:03:37,172 --> 00:03:39,633
--Beware!
--Nice try ...

28
00:03:40,675 --> 00:03:42,803
I am not concerned with
be eaten by mosquitoes.

29
00:03:43,261 --> 00:03:45,639
I want you to give us
tapas in the ass before eating?

30
00:03:45,806 --> 00:03:48,308
--Oh, yeah? Like this?
--I love.

31
00:03:49,684 --> 00:03:51,978
Whitney, where are you now?

32
00:03:52,145 --> 00:03:54,731
--Here.
--Really?

33
00:03:55,315 --> 00:03:56,691
Here, the same thing.

34
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:01,654
--Hey! You are reading right?
--I!

35
00:04:01,988 --> 00:04:04,157
--Come on, guys. Here.
--Where are we going?

36
00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:07,202
--This is heavy, and is heat.
--Where are we?

37
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,569
Man, we screwed.

38
00:04:15,578 --> 00:04:18,046
--No we are not.
--We are, yes.

39
00:04:18,255 --> 00:04:20,215
Not everything is
No GPS, Richie.

40
00:04:20,382 --> 00:04:22,509
Had a sign that we
less than a mile ...

41
00:04:22,551 --> 00:04:24,886
... then we
close. I think.

42
00:04:25,053 --> 00:04:26,513
You think?

43
00:04:26,763 --> 00:04:29,891
You do not know how to use it, it is
almost night. You know where it is or not?

44
00:04:30,142 --> 00:04:32,018
Look, I planted
shit, Richie. Okay?

45
00:04:32,602 --> 00:04:34,022
I had this track
a source of second hand.

46
00:04:34,026 --> 00:04:35,922
We must be close,
gives up to smell it.

47
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:38,975
Look, let's camp here.
Tomorrow morning ...

48
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:41,194
... you and I,
we get the grass ...

49
00:04:41,236 --> 00:04:44,489
... We 're gonna get the maximum possible,
and put in the truck.

50
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:46,700
E--back before breakfast.
--Hey, guys!

51
00:04:46,825 --> 00:04:48,493
And nobody needs to know.

52
00:04:49,327 --> 00:04:52,122
Nor need that has a
perfect place and clean here.

53
00:04:52,414 --> 00:04:55,750
Perfect! Camp here. Hey!

54
00:04:56,418 --> 00:04:58,837
You know how much money we earn
selling this herb?

55
00:04:59,004 --> 00:05:00,338
Fuck you money!

56
00:05:01,015 --> 00:05:04,468
So, I listen. Relax ...
--I am relaxed, you know why?

57
00:05:04,718 --> 00:05:07,220
Because I will be rich, and knows
what are the rich? Relax.

58
00:05:07,304 --> 00:05:08,722
You have to relax.

59
00:05:09,181 --> 00:05:10,849
I need to relax?
You need.

60
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:23,861
Hey, guys! Staff.

61
00:05:24,321 --> 00:05:26,656
I found some huts
old there ...

62
00:05:26,698 --> 00:05:28,200
... must be that
old camp.

63
00:05:28,909 --> 00:05:30,410
Who wants to look?

64
00:05:30,994 --> 00:05:33,246
Only we make it?

65
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,750
No more shit European, yes
drink is a true American.

66
00:05:38,376 --> 00:05:40,962
Know that the camp was
closed for more than 20 years.

67
00:05:42,297 --> 00:05:45,092
A woman was
completely crazy.

68
00:05:45,175 --> 00:05:48,678
Killed all advisers and
blamed for the son to have drowned.

69
00:05:49,054 --> 00:05:52,431
He was deformed, or
retarded, or something ...

70
00:05:54,086 --> 00:05:56,331
Mom was mad.

71
00:05:56,686 --> 00:05:58,731
Apparently, there was
a survivor.

72
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:03,944
One girl cut the head
this woman with an ax.

73
00:06:04,361 --> 00:06:06,863
--E is still worse ...
--Of course I cut.

74
00:06:07,739 --> 00:06:10,492
His son, Jason ...

75
00:06:12,994 --> 00:06:14,830
... again.

76
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,709
He was there.

77
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,380
He saw his mother
be decapitated.

78
00:06:25,215 --> 00:06:27,342
A friend of mine who
camped here ...

79
00:06:27,926 --> 00:06:31,096
Camped yes! He said that the police
Jason asked about this ...

80
00:06:32,597 --> 00:06:34,557
You know?

81
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:37,227
Do not believe in me, as always.
--I do not believe in me.

82
00:06:37,602 --> 00:06:39,314
But I am sure that this story ...

83
00:06:39,322 --> 00:06:41,314
happens in a place called
Camp Crystal Lake.

84
00:06:42,274 --> 00:06:44,818
You know how many lakes should
have the name of Crystal Lake?

85
00:06:45,152 --> 00:06:47,487
It's the same thing with drinks,
for example, water.

86
00:06:47,654 --> 00:06:50,991
Go to the supermarket, every bottle
Crystal water is something.

87
00:06:52,117 --> 00:06:53,535
--Aquafin.
--Okay.

88
00:06:53,744 --> 00:06:57,539
Could have happened anywhere.
Just to scare children.

89
00:06:58,081 --> 00:07:00,792
--Moreover, the beer is treating you well?
--Better than you.

90
00:07:01,081 --> 00:07:03,292
You can drink it.
Its the one, my.

91
00:07:03,295 --> 00:07:04,562
Four will not
can piss right.

92
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:07,174
--Know that this happens to me.
--This is what you think.

93
00:07:11,011 --> 00:07:12,554
Can I talk to you?

94
00:07:15,807 --> 00:07:18,310
--You marshmallow in my knee.
--Where are you going?

95
00:07:18,314 --> 00:07:20,520
--Give a quickie.
--Really?

96
00:07:20,854 --> 00:07:23,605
Hey, Mike!
USA condom.

97
00:07:25,254 --> 00:07:26,905
Size Extra--Small.

98
00:07:27,944 --> 00:07:30,530
Sometimes we have to do things
crazy to survive.

99
00:07:30,739 --> 00:07:34,534
If we were dying of hunger,
and you were dead.

100
00:07:35,327 --> 00:07:36,661
I eat your leg.

101
00:07:37,037 --> 00:07:38,955
--What love.
--Thanks.

102
00:07:39,206 --> 00:07:41,633
Why eat my leg?
I can teach you to fish.

103
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:45,128
Vai--fish!
--Not as fish.

104
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,963
It was not what you told me.

105
00:07:56,833 --> 00:08:00,477
Look, I
stay here long.

106
00:08:01,353 --> 00:08:03,563
The history of
Wade you scared?

107
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,193
Please, I just ...

108
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,193
I feel good here.

109
00:08:12,406 --> 00:08:14,366
So far from my mother.

110
00:08:14,658 --> 00:08:17,494
His mother who asked me to get it
town for a few days.

111
00:08:18,286 --> 00:08:20,580
--Really?
--It.

112
00:08:21,915 --> 00:08:24,709
She is in good hands
have a nurse there.

113
00:08:27,838 --> 00:08:29,214
Come on ...

114
00:08:29,464 --> 00:08:31,800
... make sex,
with her boyfriend.

115
00:08:32,134 --> 00:08:34,052
Those tendinhas
of shit ...

116
00:08:36,134 --> 00:08:39,052
We can do food.
Take a walk in the woods.

117
00:08:39,134 --> 00:08:42,052
And then we came back
to another.

118
00:08:52,362 --> 00:08:54,364
I am an idiot.

119
00:08:54,698 --> 00:08:55,866
Richie!

120
00:08:57,451 --> 00:08:59,161
The data from event
are not hitting.

121
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,664
--Dude, that shit.
--Yeah.

122
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,002
You know what?

123
00:09:07,627 --> 00:09:08,795
What?

124
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:12,966
We are less than half
miles away.

125
00:09:13,717 --> 00:09:15,051
Shut up!

126
00:09:16,887 --> 00:09:18,472
You know what I
leaves happy, Richie?

127
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:22,225
Global position systems,
antennas and mobile phones with GPS ...

128
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,730
NASA's technology
in the palm of your hand.

129
00:09:28,648 --> 00:09:32,319
All this connected mandingo
signs pro space. Signs!

130
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:36,719
The satellite to handle, and he turns around
you say: "Thank you, GPS ...

131
00:09:36,748 --> 00:09:40,519
I now send you a sign! "
And all this in the palm of your hand.

132
00:09:40,554 --> 00:09:44,041
Technology, man,
is unbelievable.

133
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:47,941
Wade, get out man. Speech
those for other nonsense.

134
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:50,003
Actually have something
better to do?

135
00:09:55,175 --> 00:09:57,427
So, Richard, my friend ...
I am leaving out.

136
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,763
--Do it, man.
--I do.

137
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:03,016
"May the Force be with you."

138
00:11:04,453 --> 00:11:06,329
Fuck! Yes!

139
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:21,094
I love you ...

140
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,889
... you and you.

141
00:11:25,265 --> 00:11:26,475
And you too.

142
00:11:26,975 --> 00:11:28,518
My God.

143
00:11:33,315 --> 00:11:34,900
What the fuck ...?

144
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:37,903
Wait! No! No!

145
00:11:41,406 --> 00:11:43,700
CRYSTAL LAKE CAMPS
Should be the camp that Wade said.

146
00:11:47,913 --> 00:11:50,623
Come--out.
--No, I am not related.

147
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:54,376
Come on. Come on.

148
00:12:09,851 --> 00:12:11,478
Wow, look at that.

149
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,152
Mike, where are you going?

150
00:12:19,403 --> 00:12:20,946
--Come on inside.
--No.

151
00:12:20,987 --> 00:12:23,240
--Where is your sense of adventure?
--What is.

152
00:12:24,408 --> 00:12:26,326
--Are you afraid?
--No.

153
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,546
I bet you have things
ways here.

154
00:12:43,468 --> 00:12:45,011
Mike, do not go there.

155
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,972
And if you have someone living here?

156
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,849
There is nobody living here.

157
00:12:52,144 --> 00:12:53,687
You hungry?

158
00:13:10,954 --> 00:13:13,206
Wow, looks like this
shit is old.

159
00:13:16,126 --> 00:13:18,837
It is as if it had been dragged
of another century to come.

160
00:13:35,604 --> 00:13:37,147
Look at this.

161
00:14:01,004 --> 00:14:02,839
Hey, it looks like you.

162
00:14:06,885 --> 00:14:09,137
--It does not!
--It seems so.

163
00:14:09,638 --> 00:14:11,389
It is legal, could keep it.

164
00:14:30,742 --> 00:14:32,411
It seems the fourth
of a child.

165
00:14:42,546 --> 00:14:45,340
The boy's story
not called Jason?

166
00:14:46,216 --> 00:14:48,135
I want to leave now.

167
00:14:48,593 --> 00:14:50,303
--Oh, what is?
--Please.

168
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,722
--You like?
--Yes, wait for me.

169
00:14:53,932 --> 00:14:55,851
--I think I will ...
--No, we at the same time.

170
00:14:56,726 --> 00:14:58,353
We like that.

171
00:14:59,604 --> 00:15:01,606
Stop! Shit, I heard something.

172
00:15:02,524 --> 00:15:04,109
Hey, I'm serious.

173
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,487
--What?
--I think Wade is looking at us.

174
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,701
Fuck, let the freak look.

175
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,162
Okay?

176
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:19,916
Wade ...

177
00:15:20,584 --> 00:15:23,670
Dude, you're out there in
looking, that is not cool!

178
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:26,423
Come on, man!

179
00:15:30,302 --> 00:15:31,803
I think I did.

180
00:15:34,302 --> 00:15:36,803
--Wait!
--Oh, my God.

181
00:15:52,074 --> 00:15:53,658
Wade!

182
00:15:54,326 --> 00:15:56,036
I'll kill you!

183
00:16:02,834 --> 00:16:03,877
Okay.

184
00:16:04,544 --> 00:16:06,338
--Okay?
--All right.

185
00:16:06,588 --> 00:16:08,924
No, tell him
leave us alone.

186
00:16:11,593 --> 00:16:14,179
I will not leave it outside
with an erection.

187
00:16:15,013 --> 00:16:17,349
Will not achieve anything
if you do not.

188
00:16:19,351 --> 00:16:21,436
Do not move! Okay?

189
00:16:49,351 --> 00:16:50,436
Richie?

190
00:17:00,976 --> 00:17:03,311
Richie, stop it.

191
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:13,918
Wade!

192
00:17:14,948 --> 00:17:19,118
If you jump to any tree, I
beat you in the face, as you notice.

193
00:17:21,413 --> 00:17:24,541
Come on, man. I have to
to go back to my tent.

194
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:29,421
Holy shit.

195
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:34,509
Damn,
found the grass.

196
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:51,909
Wade? Wade!

197
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:06,909
Wade? Wade!

198
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:17,909
Amanda!

199
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,405
Whitney, you have to see it.

200
00:19:18,613 --> 00:19:20,449
Mike ... come on.

201
00:19:20,741 --> 00:19:22,284
No, really.
You must see this.

202
00:19:22,576 --> 00:19:24,286
Someone was here.

203
00:19:35,297 --> 00:19:36,798
What is that?

204
00:19:37,257 --> 00:19:38,842
Something in there.

205
00:19:39,551 --> 00:19:41,344
Looks like a type of dog.

206
00:19:42,471 --> 00:19:43,805
Are you crazy?

207
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:52,272
Oh, my God!

208
00:19:57,277 --> 00:19:58,904
Is there anything out there.

209
00:20:03,777 --> 00:20:04,904
Let's see.

210
00:20:32,229 --> 00:20:33,647
Get off the floor!

211
00:21:12,477 --> 00:21:13,603
Run!

212
00:21:13,937 --> 00:21:15,855
Run, Whitney!

213
00:21:38,754 --> 00:21:40,255
Oh, God.

214
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:08,908
Whitney, help me!
Whitney, please help me!

215
00:22:22,506 --> 00:22:24,174
Crap.

216
00:22:46,987 --> 00:22:50,700
FRIDAY 13

217
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,375
After 6 Weeks

218
00:23:18,562 --> 00:23:21,898
Oh, my God. A baby
have more space in the womb.

219
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,320
Hey, Lawrence,
that such an aid?

220
00:23:28,655 --> 00:23:32,659
Not handle well, man. The only black
fill the tank for you? Damn.

221
00:23:34,661 --> 00:23:35,996
Sure. Hey, Nolan.

222
00:23:36,496 --> 00:23:38,165
How about you buy me?

223
00:23:38,874 --> 00:23:41,334
Yeah, man. Hey, if you want
also give a quickie.

224
00:23:41,793 --> 00:23:44,795
Okay, well ...
We left for later.

225
00:23:49,593 --> 00:23:52,971
Hey, man! I have a
hearted.

226
00:23:57,093 --> 00:24:01,571
Thank you. It is a gift,
indeed, but ...

227
00:24:01,855 --> 00:24:05,067
Look, I'm looking for my sister,
is missing for 1 month and a half.

228
00:24:06,651 --> 00:24:09,321
Why all this?
Do you think sex is?

229
00:24:10,489 --> 00:24:13,825
I am taking this pile
and not have to fill me ...

230
00:24:14,201 --> 00:24:16,369
And this is not for sex.

231
00:24:16,661 --> 00:24:19,247
--And what are they?
--For an experiment.

232
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:23,376
Okay, but I will not
pay for this shit.

233
00:24:24,211 --> 00:24:26,922
Mind if I put a
notice in the window or something?

234
00:24:27,547 --> 00:24:29,674
I heard, very sad.

235
00:24:30,258 --> 00:24:33,553
I would fill
the store with it ...

236
00:24:34,054 --> 00:24:36,014
but the owner who
dictates the rules.

237
00:24:36,348 --> 00:24:38,058
He is a true ...

238
00:24:42,396 --> 00:24:45,857
He is here? Can I talk to him,
he can understand the situation.

239
00:24:46,608 --> 00:24:51,195
Hey, go buy something? Already
here a long time, so ...

240
00:24:53,698 --> 00:24:54,866
Sure, okay.

241
00:24:56,535 --> 00:24:58,787
So are 2 water
and gasoline.

242
00:24:59,663 --> 00:25:01,331
2 water and gasoline.

243
00:25:01,706 --> 00:25:03,208
I must be an idiot.

244
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,296
All right, brother?

245
00:25:08,797 --> 00:25:10,215
Yeah, okay. Thank you.

246
00:25:10,424 --> 00:25:11,800
But I am not your brother.

247
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:15,178
Will not longer be my friend
after that, leaving me?

248
00:25:15,637 --> 00:25:18,481
--Let him, Trent.
--I? This guy is an idiot.

249
00:25:18,515 --> 00:25:20,851
Yeah, I am that I am
being an idiot.

250
00:25:21,893 --> 00:25:23,812
Lord, thank you
in any way.

251
00:25:24,855 --> 00:25:26,273
Sorry.

252
00:25:28,191 --> 00:25:29,443
Thank you.

253
00:25:37,701 --> 00:25:39,286
Fasten your seat belts!

254
00:25:41,701 --> 00:25:43,286
DISAPPEARANCE
Has anyone seen WHITNEY?

255
00:25:55,719 --> 00:25:58,346
WELCOME TO CRYSTAL LAKE

256
00:26:22,037 --> 00:26:23,580
Welcome back, Clay.

257
00:26:24,706 --> 00:26:26,917
Good morning, officer Bracke.

258
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,461
Son, I know you think
we are not on your side ...

259
00:26:29,544 --> 00:26:32,922
and that we are a shower
the police provincial imbeciles.

260
00:26:34,341 --> 00:26:36,802
But I did everything that
could in this case ...

261
00:26:37,052 --> 00:26:40,347
3 did dozens of interviews
and searches for his sister on the spot.

262
00:26:41,098 --> 00:26:45,029
You know how many thousands of people
disappear each year?

263
00:26:45,051 --> 00:26:46,944
Included in that state.

264
00:26:47,229 --> 00:26:48,647
But there was no
no evidence ...

265
00:26:48,814 --> 00:26:50,200
that something has happened to Whitney
Miller ...

266
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,086
or the other boys in Crystal Lake.

267
00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:54,911
Has no car, witnesses ...

268
00:26:56,821 --> 00:26:57,823
nothing.

269
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:02,285
One of the boys was
her boyfriend, right?

270
00:27:03,953 --> 00:27:04,963
Sure.

271
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:09,959
Well, probably
resolved traveling together.

272
00:27:10,999 --> 00:27:13,696
My mother just died
of cancer, I told you?

273
00:27:14,797 --> 00:27:16,841
--No, sir.
Well, he died.

274
00:27:17,592 --> 00:27:22,520
He was ill for a long time,
Whitney and her care.

275
00:27:22,555 --> 00:27:23,807
Every day.

276
00:27:25,275 --> 00:27:27,561
And then my sister did not
appears for the funeral.

277
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:33,900
If you knew my sister,
it would not be possible.

278
00:27:36,361 --> 00:27:38,529
She is not here, son.

279
00:27:38,993 --> 00:27:43,159
Look in other places, as
doing the other families.

280
00:28:02,721 --> 00:28:03,764
Cool.

281
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,140
Crap.

282
00:28:12,064 --> 00:28:13,690
Man to the ground!

283
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,942
Someone is getting
sign here?

284
00:28:16,193 --> 00:28:17,652
Are you kidding?

285
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,238
I have a business
treat this week--end.

286
00:28:20,255 --> 00:28:21,489
What business?

287
00:28:21,514 --> 00:28:23,200
Music, see discography.

288
00:28:23,533 --> 00:28:26,327
Really? Which kind? Rap?

289
00:28:27,287 --> 00:28:29,305
Why is that
be racist ...

290
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:31,041
look, I
label. Okay?

291
00:28:32,141 --> 00:28:34,302
For I am not black
I hear Green Day?

292
00:28:34,961 --> 00:28:38,172
All right, I was stupid.
So what kind of music?

293
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:39,899
Rap.

294
00:28:45,764 --> 00:28:47,099
Here it is.

295
00:28:47,933 --> 00:28:49,309
Oh, my God.

296
00:28:49,601 --> 00:28:54,062
Okay, guys. Has 2 bedrooms
up there, 1 down here ...

297
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:55,523
Someone goes to sleep on the couch.

298
00:28:58,818 --> 00:29:00,903
This is a scary pussy.

299
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,822
It is a cat of the mountains
the first that my father killed.

300
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:06,951
It seems that nothing here has
value, but in fact has.

301
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,331
--Is larger than our room.
--Hey, get the feet of the table, please.

302
00:29:15,252 --> 00:29:17,586
So, to feel at home.

303
00:29:20,257 --> 00:29:23,384
--What do you do first?
--What do you want?

304
00:29:26,138 --> 00:29:29,223
Well, I brought my brinquedinho.
I think that breaking a branch.

305
00:29:35,063 --> 00:29:36,314
Lucy ...

306
00:29:36,565 --> 00:29:39,440
the baby is his?
--No, you're cheating me.

307
00:29:39,443 --> 00:29:42,236
--No.
--I saw a bald other day!

308
00:29:42,443 --> 00:29:44,236
A bald!

309
00:30:14,468 --> 00:30:15,720
Hello?

310
00:30:17,968 --> 00:30:18,920
Hello?

311
00:30:46,968 --> 00:30:48,720
I just wanted to ask you ...

312
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,767
I ask you ...
was a person?

313
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:56,228
My sister ...

314
00:30:57,229 --> 00:30:59,940
came camping here
with some friends.

315
00:31:00,273 --> 00:31:02,650
E is missing.

316
00:31:04,419 --> 00:31:07,321
She is not missing,
is dead.

317
00:31:07,989 --> 00:31:09,032
What?

318
00:31:09,241 --> 00:31:12,869
Who disappears here,
disappears forever.

319
00:31:13,494 --> 00:31:15,705
The outsiders come here
and do not know where to go ...

320
00:31:15,722 --> 00:31:16,995
get into trouble.

321
00:31:17,082 --> 00:31:19,543
Do not let him be at peace.

322
00:31:19,582 --> 00:31:22,043
So he does.

323
00:31:22,253 --> 00:31:22,971
Who?

324
00:31:26,466 --> 00:31:28,593
Who? Madam, please, who?

325
00:31:39,062 --> 00:31:41,647
I can not stop
to take it.

326
00:31:50,991 --> 00:31:52,451
Yes!

327
00:31:54,494 --> 00:31:57,413
Guys, watch out
the floor, please, is new ...

328
00:31:59,057 --> 00:32:01,292
This is a game
you play in the street.

329
00:32:09,885 --> 00:32:11,344
Hey, this is a legal place.

330
00:32:11,553 --> 00:32:14,014
Want to take a spin
to do an exercise?

331
00:32:14,264 --> 00:32:18,017
It would be nice, but not
I leave them alone.

332
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,645
What are you talking about?

333
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:24,191
Have you seen what they are
doing there?

334
00:32:24,983 --> 00:32:27,902
They are crazy.
Of rotten drunk.

335
00:32:29,946 --> 00:32:31,782
What do you think you gonna do?

336
00:32:32,949 --> 00:32:35,326
--Stealing the head of the deer?
--They could.

337
00:32:35,744 --> 00:32:38,914
How will they do to escape it
we are all in the same car?

338
00:32:39,372 --> 00:32:40,832
Well, I exercise?

339
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:46,337
Why learn something nice but
missing someone you practice with me.

340
00:32:47,214 --> 00:32:49,757
Ah, love that. What love.

341
00:32:52,719 --> 00:32:55,596
--I take a walk, do you want?
--Whether it?

342
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,006
--Of course I do.
--I know.

343
00:32:57,514 --> 00:32:58,916
Brings me a beer?

344
00:33:30,841 --> 00:33:32,467
Excuse me.

345
00:33:47,107 --> 00:33:48,567
Sorry.

346
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,695
Jesus Christ.

347
00:33:52,696 --> 00:33:54,406
Lucky to be full ...

348
00:33:54,656 --> 00:33:58,576
I, therefore, you cut
as a salami, kid.

349
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:03,623
Okay, did not want to distract him, only
I wanted a little of your attention.

350
00:34:03,874 --> 00:34:05,959
This is the property of
Mr Garret ...

351
00:34:06,084 --> 00:34:09,254
is lucky to have not
filled his ass with bullets.

352
00:34:10,005 --> 00:34:13,007
Someone was stealing
things of the Lord Garret.

353
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,944
Look, I just came here to
ask you something, right?

354
00:34:16,136 --> 00:34:19,213
Looking for that girl,
perhaps has seen.

355
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,115
Is missing
more than a month.

356
00:34:21,724 --> 00:34:23,185
I have seen, man.

357
00:34:24,561 --> 00:34:26,812
--But not seen.
--Thanks.

358
00:34:27,522 --> 00:34:29,440
--Take care.
--You too.

359
00:34:30,984 --> 00:34:32,860
Hey! Hey, hey! I forgot.

360
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:34,846
Want to buy a
bit of grass?

361
00:34:34,863 --> 00:34:39,825
Really! I am full of shit
growing in my planting. Want?

362
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:41,887
No, thanks.

363
00:34:41,995 --> 00:34:43,830
Are you sure, man?
I have a lot ...

364
00:34:44,956 --> 00:34:48,000
Are you sure? Vai lose good.

365
00:34:48,518 --> 00:34:50,419
You fucked up now, boy.

366
00:34:50,837 --> 00:34:53,856
Skip right. Idiot.

367
00:34:54,132 --> 00:34:56,843
Just relax. Okay?

368
00:34:59,304 --> 00:35:03,808
If you are not comfortable with
them here, that called?

369
00:35:04,592 --> 00:35:06,761
To admire his house?

370
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:09,647
No, to have a
good week--end.

371
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:14,151
Hey, guys, want to go see
other side of the lake with us?

372
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:18,698
You know that ...

373
00:35:19,366 --> 00:35:24,084
no, all is well,
is already getting late.

374
00:35:24,287 --> 00:35:26,164
It is, get my truck.

375
00:35:27,832 --> 00:35:30,793
I trust you.
Do me a favor ...

376
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,330
take the petrol and
filling the boat ...

377
00:35:32,337 --> 00:35:36,673
is the south side, go the way
of land and turn right.

378
00:35:36,883 --> 00:35:39,540
After ... why not
type everything in the browser?

379
00:35:40,052 --> 00:35:40,929
Technology!

380
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,681
Have fun, bye.

381
00:35:46,684 --> 00:35:48,144
Do not take my boat ...

382
00:35:48,161 --> 00:35:50,646
I am the only one who knows
ran it. Okay?

383
00:35:51,122 --> 00:35:52,423
The orders, Captain.

384
00:35:52,822 --> 00:35:54,023
That's right.

385
00:35:58,613 --> 00:36:01,975
At the time he said:
"Do not take my boat ...

386
00:36:01,983 --> 00:36:03,910
that was a guarantee
that I pegaria.

387
00:36:03,919 --> 00:36:05,920
Even acting as
a sociopath ...

388
00:36:05,971 --> 00:36:09,790
I can say that I found
that ... exciting.

389
00:36:15,088 --> 00:36:18,799
Hello, sorry to bother but
I'm looking for my sister.

390
00:36:19,942 --> 00:36:20,910
Oi.

391
00:36:23,371 --> 00:36:25,848
--No luck?
--No, nothing yet.

392
00:36:27,017 --> 00:36:31,310
--I?
--Yes ... bright.

393
00:36:31,854 --> 00:36:33,898
She is beautiful.

394
00:36:35,733 --> 00:36:36,859
Thank you.

395
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,529
Want to get a little
and have a drink?

396
00:36:42,699 --> 00:36:44,909
I think her boyfriend
would not love.

397
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,303
Do not worry about it,
he will be fine.

398
00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:51,999
Here is an American junkie
looking for food.

399
00:36:59,424 --> 00:37:01,801
It will be interesting.

400
00:37:03,011 --> 00:37:06,180
Hey, Trent, remember ...

401
00:37:07,181 --> 00:37:08,558
Clay.

402
00:37:09,893 --> 00:37:12,445
Yes, of course,
remember the Clay.

403
00:37:12,487 --> 00:37:14,355
Why is he
in my home?

404
00:37:15,565 --> 00:37:17,984
--Hey, rookie, beer?
--No.

405
00:37:18,443 --> 00:37:21,404
He has to go, has
things to solve, right?

406
00:37:22,113 --> 00:37:23,531
Sure.

407
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,010
Look, if you have
hunger, we can ...

408
00:37:27,096 --> 00:37:29,540
Sure. Hey, Clay ...

409
00:37:29,946 --> 00:37:33,540
it is obviously
trying to be nice, but ...

410
00:37:33,547 --> 00:37:36,252
can not stay here, no offense,
but this is a private party ...

411
00:37:36,261 --> 00:37:38,379
and I do not know you.
--No, I do not know.

412
00:37:38,963 --> 00:37:40,723
Funny,
I just say that.

413
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,092
A few seconds ago
I do not know you.

414
00:37:43,426 --> 00:37:46,804
If I were you, would soon
before I irritate ...

415
00:37:47,013 --> 00:37:48,723
--Oh, yeah?
--It.

416
00:37:49,307 --> 00:37:51,935
--What happens?
--Calm down, Trent, right?

417
00:37:52,477 --> 00:37:54,187
So come on, I will follow.

418
00:37:56,522 --> 00:37:59,400
Jenna, what is? Where are you?

419
00:38:07,075 --> 00:38:08,409
Sorry about that.

420
00:38:08,826 --> 00:38:10,954
All right.
The house is his.

421
00:38:11,621 --> 00:38:12,872
Where is your car?

422
00:38:13,164 --> 00:38:15,792
I have no car,
but I have ...

423
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,418
Cool!

424
00:38:18,002 --> 00:38:19,420
This thing runs?

425
00:38:19,837 --> 00:38:21,214
Yes, it did.

426
00:38:21,965 --> 00:38:24,050
So where is it now?

427
00:38:24,342 --> 00:38:27,845
Well, I was not yet on the other side
the lake, then I take a look.

428
00:38:28,137 --> 00:38:30,640
--Want company?
--I would love the company.

429
00:39:04,332 --> 00:39:05,801
This shit heavy, huh?

430
00:39:20,732 --> 00:39:22,901
Damn, that's it.

431
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,778
Bitch.

432
00:39:30,825 --> 00:39:32,660
Oh, Daddy is going to
a lambidinha.

433
00:39:35,955 --> 00:39:37,540
Like that, bitch?

434
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:39,709
You know I like.

435
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,257
What the hell was that?

436
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,557
Must be someone trying to
steal my grass up there.

437
00:40:20,862 --> 00:40:21,924
Crap.

438
00:40:58,162 --> 00:41:01,124
Jinai, are you, honey?

439
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,837
It's a time, Jinai.

440
00:41:06,379 --> 00:41:08,339
Remember the night
particular we have?

441
00:41:09,173 --> 00:41:11,301
When you get
my virginity.

442
00:41:11,676 --> 00:41:16,680
So sexy, more tightly than
never. I will eat you both ...

443
00:41:17,765 --> 00:41:19,017
What the fuck ...?

444
00:41:30,361 --> 00:41:33,072
Motherfucker, that
fuck it was true!

445
00:42:22,455 --> 00:42:24,707
I do not know, really think
should take the boat?

446
00:42:25,416 --> 00:42:27,043
--I know.
--What?

447
00:42:27,335 --> 00:42:31,214
Always talk much, but in the end
it's just a scared little girl.

448
00:42:31,673 --> 00:42:33,966
Oh, yeah? Okay, then.

449
00:42:34,425 --> 00:42:37,178
Want to see what really
is there? Then go.

450
00:42:37,425 --> 00:42:39,178
Sure. Go!

451
00:42:42,577 --> 00:42:45,979
So you and your sister
were very close.

452
00:42:46,187 --> 00:42:48,690
Yeah, we were very close when
young, but then we separate.

453
00:42:49,148 --> 00:42:52,777
I left the house with 17 years
and it was with my mother ...

454
00:42:54,028 --> 00:42:55,530
I think it was something that
I had to do.

455
00:42:56,531 --> 00:42:58,408
I know there, it always
was responsible.

456
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:03,663
So when was the last
time you talked?

457
00:43:04,497 --> 00:43:07,625
There are 6 months.
We fight, actually ...

458
00:43:08,835 --> 00:43:11,212
she called me and said
I wanted to see me.

459
00:43:11,546 --> 00:43:14,340
That had me and I
never appeared.

460
00:43:14,757 --> 00:43:16,009
Excuse me.

461
00:43:19,345 --> 00:43:20,763
What is this?

462
00:43:21,097 --> 00:43:22,432
It's a GPS.

463
00:43:38,448 --> 00:43:39,449
Okay, you ready?

464
00:43:39,616 --> 00:43:40,992
Okay, come on!

465
00:43:47,332 --> 00:43:48,583
Damn!

466
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,019
Tag. Get one.

467
00:44:09,504 --> 00:44:11,606
Likes balls
in your hand, right?

468
00:44:11,731 --> 00:44:13,774
What? Whats up That?

469
00:44:13,781 --> 00:44:15,174
--Seem good, no?
--That.

470
00:44:15,776 --> 00:44:16,736
Play!

471
00:44:21,532 --> 00:44:22,408
Fuck you.

472
00:44:22,412 --> 00:44:25,161
Vai you. Vai take
a shot in tennis.

473
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:27,247
--You baby, baby.
--Really?

474
00:44:27,275 --> 00:44:30,582
--Yes.
--You missed it. During all game.

475
00:44:30,667 --> 00:44:32,252
Come on, baby.
Drink, drink, drink.

476
00:44:33,667 --> 00:44:37,252
Drink in tennis!
Drink in tennis!

477
00:44:40,343 --> 00:44:43,096
I will not drink in your shoes,
you nor USA socks.

478
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:45,056
Are the rules,
baby in tennis.

479
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:47,908
My house, my rules,
I will not drink that shit.

480
00:44:47,929 --> 00:44:49,635
--Right.
--Oh, no.

481
00:44:50,644 --> 00:44:52,814
--Want to taste?
--No.

482
00:44:52,824 --> 00:44:54,214
--I?
--Yes.

483
00:44:54,482 --> 00:44:57,025
Feygeles the world!

484
00:44:59,153 --> 00:45:00,446
Gross.

485
00:45:30,153 --> 00:45:31,446
Here!

486
00:45:39,777 --> 00:45:41,195
What are you doing? Care!

487
00:46:23,196 --> 00:46:24,781
Stay away from me.

488
00:46:25,198 --> 00:46:26,574
Oh, my God!

489
00:46:29,702 --> 00:46:31,496
Help!

490
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:51,659
Let's take a look at this
hut, then came back.

491
00:48:56,599 --> 00:48:58,351
You should
call the police.

492
00:48:58,601 --> 00:49:01,271
I called the police, already
gave up looking.

493
00:49:01,437 --> 00:49:02,897
Everyone, except me.

494
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,066
So should
seek more, because ...

495
00:49:06,859 --> 00:49:09,236
--Okay?
--I am well, I'm fine.

496
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,655
--Are you sure?
--I.

497
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:17,370
We outta here.

498
00:49:32,218 --> 00:49:34,345
I hope that battery.

499
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:41,060
It is better to hide.

500
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:23,288
Where did he go?

501
00:51:30,211 --> 00:51:31,546
My God, we must go.

502
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:34,299
I have to follow it.

503
00:51:34,465 --> 00:51:36,968
He has a corpse with him.
Come on tell my friends.

504
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,255
--Okay?
--Yes.

505
00:52:14,797 --> 00:52:16,090
What is this?

506
00:52:19,552 --> 00:52:21,429
Help!

507
00:52:25,099 --> 00:52:26,226
--Come on.
--Yes.

508
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:29,020
Me!

509
00:54:07,368 --> 00:54:09,162
Clay.

510
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:23,301
Crap.

511
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:47,325
Go!

512
00:55:03,299 --> 00:55:04,759
Crap.

513
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,863
Please do not hurt me.

514
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,746
All right.

515
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:39,878
Jason, all is well.

516
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:54,642
--Here.
--Right.

517
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:31,179
In my next life ...

518
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:33,806
want to ...

519
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:37,227
a button on the pocket
back of her pants.

520
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,897
Vai there and talk to her.

521
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:42,649
You kidding?

522
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:45,985
I have more chances to eat
a penguin than eat it.

523
00:56:53,958 --> 00:56:55,985
Let's leave it stronger.

524
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:09,509
A toast to the problems
with parents and with stalker ...

525
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:13,680
we are all a
great and happy cliché.

526
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:15,265
What the fuck is that?

527
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:17,559
Please try not
burn my house.

528
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:22,355
Forgotten as
drink it?

529
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,485
Put on the lips ...

530
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,488
blow ...

531
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,658
and suck.

532
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:36,369
You do this?

533
00:57:43,419 --> 00:57:46,421
Fuck, man! Just
break the chair of my father!

534
00:57:46,438 --> 00:57:48,923
A hell of my lip!
--Fuck her lip.

535
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,842
This is a family inheritance.

536
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,970
--Oh, sorry.
--Damn!

537
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:56,723
You know, I can fix!
I just need some tools.

538
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:00,018
--He can fix.
Better--go to the shed ...

539
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:02,770
the building of tools,
is down there.

540
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:05,648
Yeah, okay.
Trent, sorry man.

541
00:58:05,755 --> 00:58:07,648
Will not disappoint.

542
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:10,278
Call me Magic Hand
because I masturbate a lot.

543
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:12,614
Grab a flashlight, moron.

544
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:18,828
Sure it will fix.

545
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:20,997
Let's finish this.

546
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:30,590
It was an ugly chair
you stick it.

547
00:58:31,507 --> 00:58:34,427
Hello, my name is Trent, and my dad I
gave that chair as a child.

548
00:58:45,325 --> 00:58:46,827
Hello everyone.

549
00:58:48,325 --> 00:58:49,827
Yes!

550
00:58:57,825 --> 00:58:59,827
You are even rich!

551
00:59:01,198 --> 00:59:02,625
Fucking hell.

552
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:06,125
The poor call it home.
Jesus Christ.

553
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:16,344
You never USA this shit.

554
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,764
Asshole of shit.
You ski ...

555
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,858
Bottled in Scotland.

556
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:35,822
Seems to have that money.

557
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:43,204
I knew you had a reason
to be your friend, Trent.

558
00:59:49,827 --> 00:59:53,204
Fuck! I am the Chris
Wilss that shit.

559
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,758
Guard me, fool!

560
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,855
Your breasts are too.

561
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:11,858
You know how to make a
girl feel special.

562
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:13,443
I know it.

563
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:39,260
Come on, baby. What
have for me? Shows.

564
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:44,222
Catalog of costumes for bath?
What kind of catalog.

565
01:00:49,588 --> 01:00:51,689
This should serve.

566
01:00:55,736 --> 01:00:58,780
As end
a perfect day.

567
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:13,419
I killed the fright!

568
01:01:13,545 --> 01:01:16,714
Where is everyone? It has a face
outside carrying a corpse.

569
01:01:16,965 --> 01:01:18,341
Jenna, Where is the phone?

570
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:19,968
I do not know. Up there?

571
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:21,761
They are taking me
because I'm stoned?

572
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:24,055
This is not legal,
because I quit smoking, right?

573
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:25,557
Where is the phone?

574
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:31,828
Hi, I report a murder.
My name is Clay Miller.

575
01:01:31,887 --> 01:01:34,732
Yes, I am in a
home in Crystal Lake.

576
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:36,484
Fast!

577
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:39,696
They are
sending someone.

578
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:41,447
--Police?
--Yes.

579
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:44,324
--Where are the others?
--I do not know. I was here all day.

580
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:47,453
Nolan went to Chelsea and
the lake, or something.

581
01:01:47,745 --> 01:01:50,164
E--Trent and Bree?
--Are in the room.

582
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:59,172
His nipples, fuck,
are so succulent.

583
01:02:02,398 --> 01:02:04,500
Everything in you is
perfect, baby.

584
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:16,900
Trent, Bree?
Are there?

585
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,574
Shut up!

586
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:26,868
Get out there!

587
01:02:30,975 --> 01:02:32,268
Ignore.

588
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,003
You have a guy out there!

589
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,601
Yeah, Trent.
I will teach you ...

590
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:56,437
you will learn!
I'll show you now ...

591
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:00,568
Jesus!

592
01:03:09,953 --> 01:03:12,163
This is a sport
of men ...

593
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:16,000
Curved like my penis.

594
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:23,383
An exchange, two laps
to the right ...

595
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:25,301
back to the middle e. ..

596
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:55,331
God, you gave me
susto a bitch, brother.

597
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,295
You are looking for that?

598
01:04:01,062 --> 01:04:03,548
Because ... complete
your fantasy.

599
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:35,848
Yeah, baby.

600
01:05:36,224 --> 01:05:37,934
That was ...

601
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:39,978
... great.

602
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,149
At the top of the list.

603
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:53,741
--Who shut the lights?
Chewie, is still out there.

604
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,996
The phone is dead.
Do you have a cell phone, Jenna?

605
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:00,039
--No signal has.
--What the fuck you doing here?

606
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:02,584
--Give out of here, man!
--Easy.

607
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:04,085
--He just wants to help.
--And you ...

608
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:06,588
left with this
subject for 8 hours ...

609
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,464
throughout the forest?

610
01:06:08,774 --> 01:06:11,853
You know? Why
the two do not give out?

611
01:06:11,874 --> 01:06:13,553
Listen, you idiot.
We have a bigger problem.

612
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:17,724
You crazy? Have a killer out there
and was he who cut the lights.

613
01:06:17,824 --> 01:06:20,894
Trent does not understand?
Chelsea Nolan and not returned.

614
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,313
Lawrence, what are you doing?

615
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,732
My friend is still there
outside, I get it.

616
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:28,735
No, it looks expensive. Do not go
out there, please.

617
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:32,270
I told you that I am fast,
nobody can get me.

618
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,324
You always amaze.

619
01:07:02,185 --> 01:07:03,895
Chewie!

620
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:22,539
Chewie, is there?

621
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:55,613
Chewie is in here?

622
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:58,718
Damn!

623
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:09,812
Let go!

624
01:09:15,777 --> 01:09:17,403
Here, son of a bitch!

625
01:09:42,971 --> 01:09:45,807
This is bullshit, it
normal light missing here.

626
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:49,310
Guys, help me!

627
01:09:53,398 --> 01:09:56,441
Me!
Please help me!

628
01:09:57,694 --> 01:09:59,821
--Lawrence!
--You can not go outside.

629
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:01,739
--We have to help him.
--We can not!

630
01:10:01,906 --> 01:10:04,659
He is using his friend as
bait. He wants us to leave.

631
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:06,244
You do not know that.

632
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:08,371
Jesus, where are the police?

633
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:12,959
We have to help him.

634
01:10:18,423 --> 01:10:19,966
Somebody help me!

635
01:10:20,267 --> 01:10:22,218
Oh, my God. Please!

636
01:10:24,846 --> 01:10:26,514
Someone must do something!

637
01:10:36,858 --> 01:10:38,776
Shut up! Shut up!

638
01:10:56,377 --> 01:10:59,963
Everything will be fine, the
police is coming.

639
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:05,053
What are you doing?

640
01:11:20,068 --> 01:11:22,053
Trent!

641
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:55,038
Jenna?

642
01:14:02,605 --> 01:14:03,856
Police!

643
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:05,692
Thank God.

644
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:10,446
Police, open!

645
01:14:14,576 --> 01:14:17,911
--Shit!
--No! My God!

646
01:14:25,253 --> 01:14:27,462
--Close the door.
--Okay.

647
01:14:27,753 --> 01:14:28,726
Crap.

648
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:31,759
--What are you doing? He is in the house?
--He killed the cop.

649
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:35,096
Damn, you have a gun?
Come now!

650
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:40,351
What are you doing?

651
01:14:41,379 --> 01:14:42,756
Give me the gun!

652
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:44,856
Is anybody there.

653
01:14:47,979 --> 01:14:49,356
Take a look.

654
01:15:05,293 --> 01:15:06,669
Bree is dead.
He killed Bree!

655
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:23,811
Come on.

656
01:15:30,109 --> 01:15:31,569
Where are the keys?

657
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:37,742
Relief, has a
police hurt!

658
01:15:37,951 --> 01:15:39,452
My keys are gone.
Where are my keys?

659
01:15:39,661 --> 01:15:41,538
Hey, Jenna! Fuck this guy,
let's get out of here!

660
01:15:47,661 --> 01:15:50,538
Come on! Hurry!

661
01:16:17,782 --> 01:16:19,409
Where is the fucking gun?

662
01:16:28,376 --> 01:16:29,919
Damn!

663
01:17:57,507 --> 01:17:59,092
He was coming here.

664
01:17:59,842 --> 01:18:01,510
--Come on.
--Okay.

665
01:18:58,818 --> 01:19:00,695
Help!

666
01:19:02,697 --> 01:19:04,991
--What was that?
--God.

667
01:19:08,513 --> 01:19:12,289
Me! Help me.

668
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:22,944
Here.

669
01:20:42,589 --> 01:20:44,507
--Clay?
--Whitney.

670
01:20:44,541 --> 01:20:47,759
--Oh, my God, Clay.
--All right, all right. I am here.

671
01:20:49,841 --> 01:20:54,259
--Okay? Okay?
--Yes.

672
01:20:58,479 --> 01:21:00,106
Just get out.

673
01:21:01,065 --> 01:21:03,526
--Come on, it will come.
--Break it.

674
01:21:04,402 --> 01:21:05,820
Just drop it. Break it.

675
01:21:11,242 --> 01:21:12,660
Stretch your hands.

676
01:21:17,081 --> 01:21:18,833
We must leave, go.

677
01:21:18,851 --> 01:21:21,502
--We gotta go.
--Just do it!

678
01:21:25,251 --> 01:21:26,502
Oh, God.

679
01:21:36,517 --> 01:21:38,311
I can see he is coming.

680
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:40,146
We gotta go.

681
01:21:42,106 --> 01:21:43,441
Come on, hurry!

682
01:21:45,526 --> 01:21:46,861
Come on.

683
01:22:17,642 --> 01:22:19,060
Has no exit.

684
01:22:19,352 --> 01:22:20,770
What do we do?

685
01:22:23,398 --> 01:22:24,732
Hurry.

686
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:33,950
Come on. We can go there.

687
01:22:34,951 --> 01:22:36,202
Follow me!

688
01:22:38,555 --> 01:22:41,124
Stay calm.
Give me your hand, Jenna, come on.

689
01:22:52,051 --> 01:22:54,345
No, fuck! No!

690
01:23:11,087 --> 01:23:13,114
This may be an exit.

691
01:23:25,027 --> 01:23:26,878
Quick, come on.

692
01:23:34,027 --> 01:23:35,678
Come on.

693
01:23:35,687 --> 01:23:37,889
--Damn! You are stuck.
--Come on!

694
01:23:49,234 --> 01:23:51,860
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand!

695
01:23:53,524 --> 01:23:56,550
Sure. One, two ...

696
01:23:57,659 --> 01:23:59,077
Run, run!

697
01:24:00,954 --> 01:24:02,914
Clay! Stop!

698
01:24:04,554 --> 01:24:05,914
No!

699
01:24:56,885 --> 01:24:58,219
Fuck you!

700
01:25:15,528 --> 01:25:17,821
Whitney. Whitney!

701
01:25:20,428 --> 01:25:21,521
Come on.

702
01:25:25,580 --> 01:25:28,523
Fast. Go!

703
01:25:45,975 --> 01:25:47,310
Hide.

704
01:27:46,512 --> 01:27:47,889
Jason.

705
01:28:01,027 --> 01:28:02,779
All right.

706
01:28:04,906 --> 01:28:06,658
You can stop now.

707
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:09,160
All right.

708
01:29:22,275 --> 01:29:23,985
Jason.

709
01:29:25,111 --> 01:29:26,654
Say "hi" to mommy.

710
01:29:28,448 --> 01:29:30,033
In hell!

711
01:31:02,623 --> 01:31:07,621
