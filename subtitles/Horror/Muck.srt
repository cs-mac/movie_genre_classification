- Fuck, Mia, just chill out.

18
00:01:26,838 --> 00:01:30,466
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
Get this stick out of my fucking dick.

19
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:32,719
Ow.

- oh, my god.
- Oh, careful, careful.

23
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:44,939
Fuck.

My fucking hero.
( Grunts )

25
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,861
Just anywhere,
Noah, that's fucking great.

26
00:01:50,028 --> 00:01:52,363
- Are you all right?
- No.

27
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,282
- Ah, fuck. My knee.
- It's going to be all right, bro.

28
00:01:54,449 --> 00:01:56,284
- We're going to get you fixed up.
- Fuck.

29
00:01:56,451 --> 00:01:58,328
- Woman: Noah?
- Noah: Kylie?

30
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:01,122
Noah. Oh, my god.

31
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:03,791
Oh, my god.

32
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,251
Don't...

33
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:08,796
- Jesus.
- Billy.

34
00:02:12,258 --> 00:02:14,135
Just leave it.

35
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:17,180
Jesus. Fuck. Ew.

36
00:02:17,347 --> 00:02:21,601
(Coughs) Oh, my god.

37
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:24,520
- And?
- Do you see yourself?

38
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:28,024
Oh, I'm sorry. Do you see
a fucking gap around here, Kylie?

39
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:29,567
I don't care if your boyfriend
can see my ass.

40
00:02:29,734 --> 00:02:32,070
I'm covered in shit
and Ava and Tyler are fucking dead.

41
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:35,198
- We don't know Ava's dead, okay?
- Well, Tyler is dead.

42
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:38,409
Yeah, Tyler's real dead
and it wasn't fucking pretty.

43
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:41,579
Look at me. Look at us.
What the fuck was that?!

44
00:02:41,746 --> 00:02:43,831
I don't know.

45
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:46,584
Whatever it is, it's nothing
that's supposed to be real.

46
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:48,002
It definitely wasn't in the brochure.

47
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:50,004
Can we please get away from this place?
Why are we stopping?

48
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:51,214
Guys, I lost my phone.
Does anyone have theirs?

49
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:52,965
No, I don't have
a fucking phone, Noah.

50
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:55,009
I don't have my wallet.
I don't have my keys, all right?

51
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:57,011
I got a fucked-up knee
and I got a bunch of internal bleeding.

52
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:59,514
- You're bleeding everywhere.
- All right, so it's not so internal.

53
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:01,182
( Groans ) Shit.

54
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:03,685
We need to get Mia inside
before she freezes.

55
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:04,894
No, I'm fine. Thanks.

56
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:07,105
I need a warm shower
and a really strong drink.

57
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:09,023
Oh, that sounds lovely.
Let's do that. I like that plan.

58
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,775
No. Drinking will thin your blood.

59
00:03:10,942 --> 00:03:12,068
Oh, thank you.
That's a wonderful fact.

60
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:14,195
Noah, please tell your girlfriend
she's not my fucking doctor.

61
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:15,988
- Or even a doctor.
- Yet.

62
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:17,448
Billy, I don't want to be
your priest, either.

63
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:19,283
- Touché. Okay.
- Guys, can you just come over here

64
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,244
and help pick Billy up
so we can get into the house?

65
00:03:21,411 --> 00:03:23,037
Careful, careful.

66
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:25,957
- ( Billy grunts ) Lift.
- Des, come on.

67
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:28,084
- Fuck.
- Do you think there's booze in there?

68
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:30,336
Yeah, there's got to be.
There's nothing else to do out here.

69
00:03:30,503 --> 00:03:32,755
We can get Mia and Billy inside,
but then we need to go find Ava.

70
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:34,382
Okay, just fucking...

71
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:36,217
you can't go back out there, Kylie.

72
00:03:36,384 --> 00:03:38,052
Let's just be clear...
we're breaking in, right?

73
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,721
- Yeah.
- Awesome.

74
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,557
Mia, we can't leave Ava
out there all alone.

75
00:03:42,724 --> 00:03:45,005
- I don't think she's doing so hot.
- You don't know that.

76
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:47,437
Look, you guys, we just need to get safe
and warm so we can figure this out.

77
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:49,188
- We can't just leave her.
- She's dead!

78
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:50,565
We all saw it.

79
00:03:50,732 --> 00:03:52,233
Going back out there
and getting yourself killed

80
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,920
isn't going to
fucking change anything.

81
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:56,070
- How can you say that?
- Look at me. Look at us.

82
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:58,030
- Look at Billy.
- I don't know what...

83
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:00,158
- shut up!
- Just shut up!

84
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:03,578
We can't do anything about Ava.

85
00:04:03,745 --> 00:04:04,787
We need to find someone to help us

86
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:06,289
or get us the fuck
out of here, all right?

87
00:04:06,456 --> 00:04:09,000
- Des, that's not doing shit...
- Please, just call someone.

88
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:11,836
- You can't go out there...
- We don't have a fucking phone!

89
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:15,047
- Please, can you call...
- We don't have a phone.

90
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:17,592
- She's not a nobel laureate.
- Okay, okay.

91
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,595
Fine. Let's just get inside.

92
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:24,348
Billy:
Ah, shit.

93
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:29,729
It doesn't look like
anyone's in there to help us.

94
00:04:29,854 --> 00:04:31,564
Great, right out of the frying pan.

95
00:04:31,731 --> 00:04:34,484
Cool, so fire's still to come.

96
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,778
At least we'll be warm.

97
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:43,785

00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:23,165
Baby, you're my hero.
Let's have sex.

162
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:24,625
Sorry, dude.

163
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:26,085
You probably don't have
enough blood left in you

164
00:10:26,252 --> 00:10:28,170
to fill that big dick of yours.

165
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:32,299
How sad is it that I'm going to die
wishing I had a smaller dick?

166
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,468
No man should die wishing that.
That's sick.

167
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:36,470
Well, if we make it out of here,
you can chop some of it off.

168
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,222
I'd rather die.

169
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:41,267
- Can you guys be serious for once?
- I'm sorry, okay?

170
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:43,644
But look at me.
I'm trying to keep my spirits up.

171
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:45,980
There's no phone.

172
00:10:46,147 --> 00:10:47,690
Whiskey and vodka,
but no phone.

173
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:50,192
- Which did you look for first?
- Lick my clit.

174
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:52,153
- Cute.
- Oh, that's right.

175
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,322
We already played that game.

176
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:58,200
Keep talking. I need as many
reasons to live as I can get.

177
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:00,687
Anyway, if there's no phone,
I'm going to go get some help.

178
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:01,996
I want to go with you.

179
00:11:02,163 --> 00:11:05,666
Babe, I need you to stay here
so you can fix Billy up

180
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,210
- and make sure Mia's all right.
- I'm fine.

181
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:10,546
No, you're not fine.
But you will be.

182
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:12,089
Oh, god. Maybe not. Fuck.

183
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:13,757
Babe, I don't like it here.

184
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:16,218
I'm gonna second that, too.

185
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:18,179
This trip has been
a total bust so far, bud.

186
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,680
- Okay, well, I'm sorry.
- Lynchburg, Tennessee.

187
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:21,648
That's where I wanted to go.
Should have gone.

188
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:24,351
Gone to the Jack Daniel's distillery,
had a cocktail.

189
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,518
Lynchburg lemonade
at the Jack Daniel's distillery.

190
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,771
Maybe a fucking novelty item,
a t-shirt that says

191
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:29,539
"I had lemonade
in lynchburg, Tennessee."

192
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:32,484
That's what I wanted to do. I would have
been happy with a fucking bottle opener.

193
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:34,528
Instead, I'm in fucking Cape Cod.

194
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:37,656
Walking through the fucking marsh.

195
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:40,951
I hate fish and chips.

196
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:44,413
Yeah, um... yeah, you know
lynchburg, Tennessee, is a dry county?

197
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,541
Thank you, Noah.

198
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,269
You're right.
That would have been lame.

199
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:50,961
This has been much better.

200
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:53,380
I'll make sure I pencil it in
next time, Princess.

201
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,216
Yeah. Just pencil that in.

202
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:58,552
Seriously, babe,
we're still stuck in this empty house

203
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,262
with no phone in the middle
of fucking nowhere.

204
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:02,765
- With god knows what out there.
- Billy, you're going to be fine.

205
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:05,559
You've got half-naked hot chicks
and apparently booze.

206
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:08,020
Exactly, huh?

207
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:09,563
This is a fucking horror movie.

208
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,608
There are five...
way too many of us left.

209
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:15,861
Des is going to get it first.
She's fucking hot.

210
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:18,280
Respectfully,
I want to disrespect that ass,

211
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:21,033
but I got to do it quick
'cause she's a fucking goner.

212
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,244
I'm fucking hurt, so I'm next.

213
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,162
Shit.

214
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:28,791
And, you, fucking han solo over here,
you're going off for help.

215
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,752
You're not coming back, boss.
Textbook, dude.

216
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,170
- You're a goner.
- You done?

217
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:36,924
No, I'm not.
Mia... Mia, she's beautiful.

218
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:39,426
She's fucking annoying
when she's freaked out.

219
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,679
- She's going to get offed pretty quick.
- Shut up, Billy.

220
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:46,350
And then there's you, Kylie.

221
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:50,062
She's sweet.
She's a little sassy, a little bitchy.

222
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:54,024
She's the girlfriend.
She's moderately dressed.

223
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:56,472
That means she's a little more classy
than everybody else.

224
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:58,112
Which means you know
you're not going to see your tits.

225
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:00,656
- It's in your fucking contract.
- Shut up, Billy.

226
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:06,495
This doesn't feel good.

227
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:08,414
Noah, we're like robbers.

228
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,749
We just broke into this house.
What if the police come?

229
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,796
Babe, I hope the police come,
but unfortunately,

230
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,586
I don't think
we're gonna get that lucky.

231
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:17,047
I don't even think there's anyone
around here that would call the police.

232
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:20,843
- Babe.
- No, babe, let's get in the house.

233
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,845
- Come on, Billy.
- Fucking...

234
00:13:23,012 --> 00:13:26,307
- here we go.
- Oh, god.

235
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:35,899
Billy: Slow, slow,
slow, slow, slow, slow.

236
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:38,610
Shit. Slow down.

237
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:40,321
Just... fucking hold on.

238
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,156
( Billy grunting )

239
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:46,660
All right. Ahh.

240
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:49,955
- Yeah.
- You all right, man?

241
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:53,625
Oh, no. Fuck me.
Oh, that hurts.

242
00:13:57,588 --> 00:14:00,466
Fire.

243
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,393
All right, guys, I'm going to go
get some help, okay?

244
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,395
- Billy: Yeah.
- Noah.

245
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:14,938
Babe.

246
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:22,988
God, you guys suck face a lot.

247
00:14:27,076 --> 00:14:30,037
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

248
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:32,539
Can you guys find someone
to pick us up besides the cops?

249
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,307
We're breaking and entering
and drinking.

250
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,418
Then stop drinking.

251
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:38,128
Who cares?
Let's just get out of here.

252
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:40,175
No. Hey, I got to agree
with Barbie on this one.

253
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:43,384
All right, I'd rather call
some real cops from home

254
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,302
than deal with some fucking
hick sheriff coming out here.

255
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,429
Fuck, you know, you guys
watch too many movies.

256
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:49,848
You know what?
I'll go find a phone and call troit

257
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:52,059
while he's still on the cape, okay?

258
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:54,895
Be careful.

259
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:57,606
Careful's my middle name.

260
00:14:57,773 --> 00:15:00,442
Yeah, no, it's Oliver.

261
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:01,610
Fag.

262
00:15:04,113 --> 00:15:05,114
Okay.

263
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,074
Just hurry up. Vémonos.
Come on.

264
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:12,454
Drink.
I need to put alcohol in my skull.

265
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:14,957
And a new leg.
Oh, my knee.

266
00:15:15,124 --> 00:15:17,459
We'll try to find you something
for your wounds.

267
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:20,879
Great, I'll just...
I'm going to stay right here.

268
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:22,965
- I'll make you a drink.
- Don't.

269
00:15:23,132 --> 00:15:24,550
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

270
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:27,177
If I'm dying,
I'm not dying fucking sober, okay?

271
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:29,847
(Laughs)
Hell, yeah. Words to live by.

272
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:32,057
- Or maybe not.
- Just make a whiskey, all right?

273
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:33,851
No O.J.

274
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:38,915
- There's no ice.
- I don't give a fuck.

275
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:40,149
Just give me the bottle.

276
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:43,944
- ( Giggles ) This bottle?
- Yes, please, Desiree.

277
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:45,446
- That bottle.
- This one?

278
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:46,947
I don't give a shit.
Just give me the fucking bottle.

279
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:49,116
- ( Giggles )
- Do that again.

280
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:52,119
No. Maybe if they knight you.

281
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:01,545
I got to get this filth off me.
There's got to be a shower upstairs.

282
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,883
Mia, do you want to come
get cleaned with me?

283
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:07,301
No, I want to stay under the blanket.

284
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:10,304
- Mia, are you sure about that, babe?
- I'm sure.

285
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:14,141
'Kay, 'cause I'd climb up those fucking
stairs with my teeth to see that naked.

286
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:16,935
Poor Billy. I know you're
just dying to see me naked.

287
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:20,397
Yeah. Given my situation here,
that's real fucking funny.

288
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:22,816
Great. There's no first aid
in the bathroom.

289
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:25,319
- Convenient.
- Yeah.

290
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:28,489
I'm gonna just see if there's anything
useful in the basement.

291
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,408
You should try to
put something else on.

292
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:32,993
Fuck off, cunt.

293
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,329
- Billy: Ohh.
- Classy.

294
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:36,872
No, she's not.

295
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:39,291
I try.

296
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:02,481
( Door creaks )

297
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:10,697
- ( Light switch clicking )
- Shit.

298
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:36,223
( Door creaks )

299
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:50,571
( Sighs )

300
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:57,786
( Exhales )

301
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:02,749
Oh, fuck it.

302
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:29,985
Ew.

303
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,614
(Water running )

304
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:42,956
Do not go in the basement,
go find a nice, big-ass fucking knife

305
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:45,626
and sit your fine ass down
right here next to me

306
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,169
and we'll wait for prince charming
to come back, huh?

307
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:50,172
Yeah, that's a great line.
Ls that how you get all the ladies?

308
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:52,633
No, no. That's...

309
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,968
- yeah, that's my big cock, yeah.
- Gross.

310
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:57,387
( laughs, grunts)

311
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:59,640
No, but seriously,
you're going to go downstairs,

312
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,933
you're going to see a mouse
or see a fucking rat...

313

- Mm-mm.
- ...You're going to scream,

314
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,479
and given my situation,
I can't go down there and save the day.

I appreciate that,
but I'm not afraid of spiders or rats.

I'll be fine.

- I'm okay.

Hey. You cold?

319

of having a boyfriend

327

- You're not wearing green.

- That's not your boyfriend.
- Where is he anyway?

335
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:18,922
- He's around here somewhere.
- Well, I hope he's wearing green.

- Dibs.
- Dibs.

341
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:50,745

to show up today,

a hot guy waltzes in,

it's like, "oh, take off your dress.
Get naked in the bathroom."

354

Get a fucking phone, call troit.

I can't believe
you're making me do this.

- Aren't you rude.

- And something strong.

00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,651
- Who was that?
- My cousin Noah.

474
00:32:23,818 --> 00:32:25,778
He wants me to pick him up
in west craven.

475
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:27,363
- Now?
- Mm-hmm.

476
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,131
Troit, that's in the middle of the cape.

477
00:32:29,282 --> 00:32:30,867
Yup. You wanna come?

478
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:33,327
I guess.

479
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:35,329
When do I say no to you?

480
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:37,457
- Every time I tell you...
- Shut up.

481
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:39,584
Well, you asked.

482
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,962
Did I hear we need to pick up
five people?

483
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:45,006
How are we all going to fit?

484
00:32:45,173 --> 00:32:47,633
Well, you could sit on my lap.
Take a ride on my lap.

485
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,886
- It'll be fun.
- Shit.

486
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:53,139
Then I might be sitting on
little-miss-local-nosebleed's face.

487
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:54,807
Oh, nice.

488
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:56,642
I don't think she'd like that.

489
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:59,395
Uh, I think she might.

490
00:32:59,562 --> 00:33:01,814
Such a pig.
I hate you.

491
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:04,692
Hey, just because your religion
doesn't like pork

492
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:06,652
or they're against it
or whatever,

493
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:08,279
it doesn't mean I can't
fantasize about you.

494
00:33:08,446 --> 00:33:09,822
Shut up, troit.

495
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:11,657
And I'm not Muslim, I'm hindu.

496
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:12,992
And you know that.
I know you know that.

497
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:15,161
Shh. Hey, hey, no.
It's okay.

498
00:33:15,328 --> 00:33:17,955
You're a terrorist
and you hate Christmas

499
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:19,707
and you want to steal
my 40 virgins,

500
00:33:19,874 --> 00:33:23,252
but, Chandi, I support you
and your crazy beliefs.

501
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:25,338
I do not know why
I hang out with you.

502
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:29,091
Yes, you do.
Besides, I make you laugh.

503
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:30,676
No.

504
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:34,680
Well, yes.

505
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:37,391
But that's not enough.
You're an idiot.

506
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:41,062
And you kind of
want to bang me.

507
00:33:41,229 --> 00:33:42,522
- No.
- It's cool.

508
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:44,524
- No, I do not.
- Really, it's cool.

509
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,526
I kind of want to bang you, too.

510
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:49,403
You're drunk.

511
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:53,616
Drunk is not an excuse
for being right, baby.

512
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:56,702
Who was I named for?

513
00:33:59,664 --> 00:34:01,707
Your grandmother.

514
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:05,545
- On what side?
- Your mother's.

515
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:08,714
- How many times have I been arrested?
- Five, you criminal.

516
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:11,467
All dismissed, though.

517
00:34:11,634 --> 00:34:13,636
Bet your sweet ass.

518
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,772

west craven now is such a good idea?

- I mean...
- I know what you mean.

571
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:58,068
- Just put it on my tab.
- That's not what I meant.

You don't even have a tab.

797
01:03:31,517 --> 01:03:34,353
- Damn it! Start!
- Oh, my god!

798
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,314
Shit.

799
01:03:40,568 --> 01:03:43,112
Do something!

800
01:03:59,462 --> 01:04:02,590
Fucking hell!
Get off my car, you assholes!

801
01:04:04,759 --> 01:04:06,635
God damn it!

802
01:04:09,347 --> 01:04:11,849
You donkey fucking bastard.

803
01:04:12,975 --> 01:04:15,019
- Get the fuck off!
- ( Screaming continues )

804
01:04:16,687 --> 01:04:18,689
You fucking cock smoker!

805
01:04:18,856 --> 01:04:20,691
Son of a whore!

806
01:04:29,533 --> 01:04:31,202
Get off of me!
( Screaming )

807
01:04:34,914 --> 01:04:37,416
Oh, my god!

808
01:04:37,583 --> 01:04:39,043
Whoa.

809
01:04:41,504 --> 01:04:43,464
You fucking fuckwads!

810
01:04:49,345 --> 01:04:51,222
Get them off of me!

811
01:04:54,767 --> 01:04:57,478
There's fucks who rape the girls,

812
01:04:57,645 --> 01:04:58,938
but I don't get down that way.

813
01:04:59,105 --> 01:05:01,732
Davidson troit, just shut up
or I'm going to kill you.

814
01:05:05,319 --> 01:05:08,447
Well, you'll have to
take a number on that one.

815
01:05:11,409 --> 01:05:13,035
Fuck you, hillbilly.

816
01:05:13,202 --> 01:05:15,788
- ( Yelling )
- Holy shit.

817
01:05:19,458 --> 01:05:21,669
(Grunting )

818
01:05:31,887 --> 01:05:33,139
Hey.

819
01:05:35,015 --> 01:05:36,809
Yeah, you better run,
you fucks!

820
01:05:36,976 --> 01:05:38,894
Chandi:
What the fuck was that?!

821
01:05:39,061 --> 01:05:41,272
You'll have to narrow
that question down.

822
01:05:41,439 --> 01:05:44,275
Oh... how...

823
01:05:44,442 --> 01:05:46,277
what the fuck happened
to your car?!

824
01:05:47,778 --> 01:05:49,822
Oh, fuck.

825
01:05:49,989 --> 01:05:52,116
Oh, shit.

826
01:05:53,117 --> 01:05:54,452
Oh, my god.

827
01:05:54,618 --> 01:05:56,787
Is she...

828
01:05:56,954 --> 01:05:58,456
Mm-hmm.

829
01:05:58,622 --> 01:06:00,207
Oh, god.

830
01:06:00,374 --> 01:06:03,294
- Are you sure?
- Pretty sure.

831
01:06:04,753 --> 01:06:06,547
Are you okay?

832
01:06:06,714 --> 01:06:08,174
Yeah, I'm fine.

833
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:10,718
She's not.

834
01:06:10,885 --> 01:06:12,636
And neither is my car.

835
01:06:12,803 --> 01:06:14,889
- Oh, god.
- Jesus fucking Christ.

836
01:06:15,055 --> 01:06:17,683
- ( Gagging )
- Chandi: We have to go.

837
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:20,102
- We're gonna make it, okay?
- Yeah.

838
01:06:20,269 --> 01:06:22,146
Yeah, you're right.
I'm sorry.

839
01:06:24,064 --> 01:06:25,858
Lose those heels.

840
01:06:26,025 --> 01:06:27,776
We're gonna have to run
the rest of the way.

841
01:06:27,943 --> 01:06:30,362
- It's not much further.
- I'm not running anywhere.

842
01:06:30,529 --> 01:06:33,032
Apparently my cousin
needs more than a ride.

843
01:06:33,199 --> 01:06:34,658
There are things out there

844
01:06:34,825 --> 01:06:36,702
and something flipped
your piece-of-shit car.

845
01:06:36,869 --> 01:06:38,954
I am fucking freaking out.

846
01:06:39,121 --> 01:06:41,290
I... I need clothes.

847
01:06:41,457 --> 01:06:43,375
We need help and the police.

848
01:06:43,542 --> 01:06:46,086
And that poor girl is dead.

849
01:06:46,253 --> 01:06:48,464
Troit:
It's okay. It's going to be okay.

850
01:06:48,631 --> 01:06:51,509
- How can you say that?
- Nothing is going to happen to you.

851
01:06:51,675 --> 01:06:53,636
- Not on my watch. Promise.
- Those things...

852
01:06:53,802 --> 01:06:55,846
What were those things?

853
01:06:56,013 --> 01:06:58,432
Well, at least we know
those crazy Hicks can bleed.

854
01:06:59,642 --> 01:07:03,687
I'm more concerned with whatever
the fuck's out there that scared them.

855
01:07:03,854 --> 01:07:06,482
Did you hear that pitchfork land
after you threw it?

856
01:07:06,649 --> 01:07:08,651
Exactly.

857
01:07:10,361 --> 01:07:11,862
All right, now move that ass.

858
01:07:12,029 --> 01:07:14,114
Let's go.

859
01:07:14,281 --> 01:07:16,116
Just because your date
got crushed by a car

860
01:07:16,283 --> 01:07:18,118
doesn't mean you can
smack my ass.

861
01:07:18,285 --> 01:07:21,372
Hey, I just saved it.
I can smack it whenever I want.

862
01:07:21,539 --> 01:07:23,666
I hate when you make sense.

863
01:07:23,832 --> 01:07:25,376
( Smooches )

864
01:07:25,543 --> 01:07:27,253
Let's go.

865
01:07:44,562 --> 01:07:46,814
Chandi, that's Noah.
Let's go.

866
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,993
Oh, shit.

867
01:08:00,661 --> 01:08:02,580
Whoa.

868
01:08:02,746 --> 01:08:04,832
Oh, my god.

869
01:08:05,916 --> 01:08:08,252
Jesus, cuz,
is that your girlfriend?

870
01:08:08,419 --> 01:08:10,087
Yeah.

871
01:08:10,254 --> 01:08:12,423
What were you going to do,
rescue us by piggyback?

872
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:15,301
No, I had a car up until
about 15 minutes ago.

873
01:08:15,467 --> 01:08:16,677
If you didn't drive
that piece of shit,

874
01:08:16,844 --> 01:08:18,429
it probably wouldn't break down
all the time.

875
01:08:18,596 --> 01:08:22,349
Hey, firstly, you didn't tell me
this was a fucking rescue mission, Noah.

876
01:08:22,516 --> 01:08:25,019
- And secondly, it didn't break down.
- Would you have come?

877
01:08:25,185 --> 01:08:27,021
Yeah.
Yeah, I would have come.

878
01:08:27,187 --> 01:08:29,523
But, dude, I would have
grabbed a knife or a gun,

879
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:31,317
a bow and arrow,
a fucking sharp stick.

880
01:08:31,483 --> 01:08:33,360
- Something!
- Want me to guess, troit?

881
01:08:33,527 --> 01:08:35,279
What the fuck happened
to your car, huh?

882
01:08:35,446 --> 01:08:37,281
Probably the same thing
that happened to her.

883
01:08:37,448 --> 01:08:39,700
Do you think
this is a fucking joke?!

884
01:08:39,867 --> 01:08:41,747
No, I don't think this is
a fucking joke at all!

885
01:08:41,785 --> 01:08:44,246
You could have told me that I was
walking into a fucking nightmare, Noah!

886
01:08:44,413 --> 01:08:45,789
I would have jerked off first!

887
01:08:45,956 --> 01:08:49,001
I'm... I'm sorry, okay?

888
01:08:49,168 --> 01:08:52,046
But it wasn't this bad
when I called you!

889
01:08:52,212 --> 01:08:55,132
Kylie wasn't dead when I left.

890
01:08:55,299 --> 01:08:57,134
Chandi:
This isn't happening.

891
01:08:57,301 --> 01:09:00,304
Is anyone else here?

892
01:09:00,471 --> 01:09:01,680
Besides the creepers.

893
01:09:01,847 --> 01:09:03,641
My friends were...

894
01:09:03,807 --> 01:09:06,810
there's fucking blood everywhere!

895
01:09:12,983 --> 01:09:14,526
Look, cuz, I mean...

896
01:09:14,693 --> 01:09:18,405
hey, if it makes you
feel any better,

897
01:09:18,572 --> 01:09:21,742
my car got tossed onto the hot chick
I was hoping to bang tonight.

898
01:09:21,909 --> 01:09:24,036
No, it doesn't
make me feel any better.

899
01:09:24,203 --> 01:09:25,996
I fucking loved her.

900
01:09:26,163 --> 01:09:28,666
I was gonna marry her.
She was gonna be a doctor.

901
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:30,918
She was beautiful.

902
01:09:31,085 --> 01:09:33,671
And now she's
under a fucking curtain.

903
01:09:34,713 --> 01:09:36,131
- Well...
- You should never try and help.

904
01:09:36,298 --> 01:09:38,967
Oh, really? I'll remember that
the next time a fucking creeper

905
01:09:39,134 --> 01:09:40,469
is trying to rape you
with a pitchfork, Chandi.

906
01:09:40,636 --> 01:09:42,513
Grow up.

907
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:46,392
- I'm so sorry.
- ( Sobbing )

908
01:09:46,558 --> 01:09:48,185
I'm sorry.

909
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:52,356
I... I don't know what to do.

910
01:09:52,523 --> 01:09:55,025
We need to get the hell out of here.
That's what we need to do.

911
01:09:55,192 --> 01:09:58,278
- Shut up, Davidson.
- What, you want to stay here?

912
01:09:58,445 --> 01:10:00,030
I hate it when he makes sense,
but he's right.

913
01:10:00,197 --> 01:10:03,450
- Yeah.
- Do any of you guys have a phone?

914
01:10:04,618 --> 01:10:06,829
He left it in the car.

915
01:10:06,995 --> 01:10:08,831
- God.
- For fuck's sake.

916
01:10:08,997 --> 01:10:11,375
I should have called the police.

917
01:10:11,542 --> 01:10:13,252
Yeah.
Yeah, you should have, Noah.

918
01:10:13,419 --> 01:10:15,504
Anybody but fucking me.

919
01:10:15,671 --> 01:10:17,631
Fuck.

920
01:10:17,798 --> 01:10:19,216
- Oh, shit.
- God.

921
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:26,849
You know, your car
was a piece of shit anyway.

922
01:10:28,392 --> 01:10:30,936
Yes, it was.

923
01:10:35,649 --> 01:10:37,985
You think insurance
covers creepers?

924
01:10:38,152 --> 01:10:41,196
Shit, you think
I had insurance, man?

925
01:10:41,363 --> 01:10:42,906
Of course not.

926
01:10:43,073 --> 01:10:46,744
Ahem. I'm happy to see
the family back together,

927
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:48,954
but I don't think they're the ones
that flipped your car.

928
01:10:49,121 --> 01:10:51,282
I don't know what happened
to your car, but there is...

929
01:10:51,373 --> 01:10:53,292
there's something in the marsh.

930
01:10:53,459 --> 01:10:55,878
Well, I'm pretty sure
I killed one of them back there

931
01:10:56,044 --> 01:10:58,088
and my car might have a killed
a couple of them.

932
01:11:00,007 --> 01:11:03,177
- Where are your shoes?
- Troit: That's your question?

933
01:11:03,343 --> 01:11:05,679
After all this,
her fucking shoes?

934
01:11:08,766 --> 01:11:11,018
Hi. I'm Chandi.

935
01:11:11,185 --> 01:11:13,812
Noah. I'm troit's cousin.

936
01:11:13,979 --> 01:11:16,315
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Really?

937
01:11:16,482 --> 01:11:18,942
Hey, why don't you guys
run and get a coffee?

938
01:11:19,109 --> 01:11:22,112
While you're at it, get me
a triple latte and a fucking shotgun.

939
01:11:22,279 --> 01:11:24,406
While you two stay out here
and get better acquainted,

940
01:11:24,573 --> 01:11:28,035
I'm gonna go inside
and find something to kill things with.

941
01:11:28,202 --> 01:11:29,620
Jesus!

942
01:11:29,787 --> 01:11:31,914
Sorry about that.

943
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,124
We should probably go help him.

944
01:11:52,226 --> 01:11:54,728
- Troit, what were you doing?
- Pissing.

945
01:11:54,895 --> 01:11:56,615
Troit, how can you piss
at a time like this?

946
01:11:59,942 --> 01:12:01,610
Holy fuck.

947
01:12:01,777 --> 01:12:04,238
I guess you can't call this
a living room anymore.

948
01:12:04,404 --> 01:12:06,698
Yeah, we should
just burn this place.

949
01:12:06,865 --> 01:12:09,326
Find me a match.

950
01:12:14,998 --> 01:12:16,500
Hey, put that down.

951
01:12:17,918 --> 01:12:19,670
- ( Scoffs )
- Oh, come on.

952
01:12:19,837 --> 01:12:22,339
Don't look at me like
I'm some kind of shitty vampire.

953
01:12:22,506 --> 01:12:24,842
There wasn't any...

954
01:12:25,008 --> 01:12:27,344
much blood in the whiskey.

955
01:12:27,511 --> 01:12:30,222
There are no words for you.

956
01:12:30,389 --> 01:12:32,224
- I don't need you drunk.
- I was drunk when you called me.

957
01:12:32,391 --> 01:12:33,952
He actually holds his liquor
quite well.

958
01:12:34,101 --> 01:12:35,936
Respect.
You see that?

959
01:12:36,103 --> 01:12:37,187
- ( Door bangs)
- ( Woman screams )

960
01:12:37,354 --> 01:12:39,064
- Jesus.
- Oh, fuck. Mia.

961
01:12:39,231 --> 01:12:42,359
Holy shit. You okay?

962
01:12:42,526 --> 01:12:45,529
It's not just the marsh.
There's something else out there.

963
01:12:46,864 --> 01:12:49,533
- People.
- Mia, what are you talking about?

964
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:51,952
- They don't like the marsh.
- Mia, what are you talking about?

965
01:12:52,119 --> 01:12:53,370
They don't go into the marsh.

966
01:12:55,664 --> 01:12:58,184
- They don't like the marsh.
- Mia, you're not making any sense.

967
01:12:58,208 --> 01:12:59,710
- I think they're afraid of the marsh.
- Where's Billy?

968
01:12:59,877 --> 01:13:02,045
Where's Billy? Mia?

969
01:13:04,256 --> 01:13:06,383
Mia, where's... where's Billy, Mia?

970
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:09,094
Come on, Noah.
You know where Billy is.

971
01:13:10,846 --> 01:13:13,223
- Or isn't.
- Fuck.

972
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:14,766
What... what are we gonna do?

973
01:13:14,933 --> 01:13:17,019
We're not safe in here.
We're not safe out there.

974
01:13:17,185 --> 01:13:19,813
- They're gonna kill us.
- Mia, they're not gonna kill us, okay?

975
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:22,065
Listen to me.
We're going to get out of here, okay?

976
01:13:22,232 --> 01:13:23,442
We're gonna to make it out of this.

977
01:13:23,609 --> 01:13:26,486
What? Shit's bad enough, dude,
don't fucking jinx us.

978
01:13:26,653 --> 01:13:28,447
- Jinx us?
- ( Screams )

979
01:13:28,614 --> 01:13:30,908
- Troit.
- No, there's fucking crazy

980
01:13:31,074 --> 01:13:34,286
albino rapists
running around outside.

981
01:13:34,453 --> 01:13:37,414
There's something else in the marsh
which is apparently worse.

982
01:13:37,581 --> 01:13:39,374
And we're stuck in this bloody house.

983
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:42,377
Literally bloody
with no phone, no weapons.

984
01:13:42,544 --> 01:13:44,212
And you know damn well
that as soon as you say,

985
01:13:44,379 --> 01:13:46,465
"everything's fine,"
we're fucked.

986
01:13:47,591 --> 01:13:48,800
All right, we're fucked.

987
01:13:48,967 --> 01:13:51,553
Hey, troit, you're right.
We're fucked.

988
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,430
Do you feel better?

989
01:13:53,597 --> 01:13:56,808
- Surprisingly, yeah.
- Not helping.

990
01:13:56,975 --> 01:13:59,186
Seriously,
do you have any sort of plan?

991
01:13:59,353 --> 01:14:01,146
- We should start by...
- ( Howling )

992
01:14:01,313 --> 01:14:04,024
- Troit!
- ( Screaming )

993
01:14:04,191 --> 01:14:07,277
- ( Glass shattering )
- Shit! don't let the beast in the door!

994
01:14:09,863 --> 01:14:11,531
They're coming for me!

995
01:14:11,698 --> 01:14:13,367
I wouldn't. Ah!

996
01:14:16,370 --> 01:14:18,830
- Mia: I killed one.
- Just lock the front door, all right?

997
01:14:18,997 --> 01:14:20,040
Chandi:
The fucking window is smashed.

998
01:14:20,207 --> 01:14:22,501
Well, it's not gonna hurt
to lock the front door.

999
01:14:22,668 --> 01:14:25,629
- ( Scoffs )
- Shit.

1000
01:14:27,798 --> 01:14:30,467
I don't want to die.
I know they're coming after me.

1001
01:14:30,634 --> 01:14:32,678
It's broken.

1002
01:14:32,844 --> 01:14:34,429
What the fuck did these people
cut their steak with?

1003
01:14:34,596 --> 01:14:36,473
Do something!

1004
01:14:37,557 --> 01:14:41,353
- Troit: We are doing something.
- Do something else!

1005
01:14:44,648 --> 01:14:45,691
I don't want to die.

1006
01:14:50,654 --> 01:14:52,864
( Crashes )

1007
01:14:53,031 --> 01:14:54,533
What the fuck?

1008
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:56,868
- ( Grunts )
- Stop it.

1009
01:14:58,704 --> 01:15:01,081
- What?
- Get us out of here.

1010
01:15:01,248 --> 01:15:03,208
- ( Screaming )
- Son of a bitch.

1011

Noah: Troit!

1013
01:15:37,909 --> 01:15:40,746
Don't worry about the dude
in the basement.

1014
01:15:40,912 --> 01:15:45,042
We're super... fucked.
( Grunts, choking )

1015
01:15:54,676 --> 01:15:57,345
- No! Troit!
- Let it go.

1016
01:16:01,933 --> 01:16:04,895
Shh. Get down.

1017
01:16:05,062 --> 01:16:06,480
(Coughing )

1018
01:16:29,836 --> 01:16:31,963
Okay, who's the cowboy?

1019
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:33,298
(Grunting )

1020
01:16:37,427 --> 01:16:39,346
You're the cowboy, huh?

1021
01:16:56,488 --> 01:16:59,116
I fucking hate you guys!

1022
01:17:01,368 --> 01:17:04,788
Which one of you fucks
flipped my car, huh?

1023
01:17:04,955 --> 01:17:06,623
God damn it.

1024
01:17:14,089 --> 01:17:16,424
Oh, no.

1025
01:17:19,886 --> 01:17:22,597
You do not go crushing hot chicks...

1026
01:17:22,764 --> 01:17:24,850
( Grunts )
...With cars.

1027
01:17:25,016 --> 01:17:28,186
Especially not my hot chick...

1028
01:17:28,353 --> 01:17:32,023
( Grunts )
...With my fucking car.

1029
01:17:32,190 --> 01:17:34,276
You fucking fuck.

1030
01:17:34,442 --> 01:17:35,902
Shit.

1031
01:17:49,875 --> 01:17:51,877
I like this shovel.

1032
01:17:55,881 --> 01:17:58,175
I don't know what kind of hell
you go to, creeper,

1033
01:17:58,341 --> 01:18:00,461
but I'm going to fuck you in the head
with this shovel

1034
01:18:00,510 --> 01:18:01,845
until I send you there.

1035
01:18:02,012 --> 01:18:03,722
I know that.

1036
01:18:17,736 --> 01:18:19,112
End of the road, fucker.

1037
01:18:20,322 --> 01:18:21,364
(Grunts)

1038
01:18:32,292 --> 01:18:34,002
(Grunts)

1039
01:18:34,169 --> 01:18:35,629
Fucking mud.

1040
01:18:35,795 --> 01:18:37,756
Fucking noose.

1041
01:18:37,923 --> 01:18:39,925
You're gonna pay
for this shirt, creeper.

1042
01:18:40,091 --> 01:18:41,509
You can't just buy one either.

1043
01:18:41,676 --> 01:18:43,428
I had it made!

1044

( Music playing )

1045
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:19,983
- Do you think it's gone?
- Yeah, I do.

1046
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:21,860
Listen, you need to go
get some help.

1047
01:20:22,027 --> 01:20:23,320
I'm going to go around back
and get troit.

1048
01:20:23,486 --> 01:20:24,863
- No, no. I'm going with you.
- No. Listen to me.

1049
01:20:25,030 --> 01:20:27,615
- Just go and get...
- Don't leave me. don't leave me.

1050
01:20:27,782 --> 01:20:30,493
Shovel!

1051
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:33,288
The next thing that creeps

1052
01:20:33,455 --> 01:20:35,915
or crawls even near me...

1053
01:20:37,542 --> 01:20:39,377
Shovel to the fucking face.

1054

( Body thuds )

1055
01:20:48,011 --> 01:20:50,513
- Eat your heart out, Barry bonds.
- Jesus.

1056
01:20:58,730 --> 01:21:00,531
What the fuck are you doing, man?
She's naked.

1057
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:03,735
Don't worry.
She's not doing anything for me.

Shit.

1060
01:21:10,241 --> 01:21:11,743
- ( Chandi screams )
- Time to go.

1061
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:14,621
Wait! What the... wait!

1062
01:21:14,788 --> 01:21:16,915
- Wait!
- Chandi: Wait.

1063
01:21:18,375 --> 01:21:20,460
Troit, where do you think
you're going?

1064
01:21:20,627 --> 01:21:22,796
- The marsh.
- No, you haven't been in there.

1065
01:21:22,962 --> 01:21:25,090
Dude, it's our only chance.
Come on.

1066
01:21:28,343 --> 01:21:30,345
- What are we doing?
- We're doing it.

1067
01:21:30,512 --> 01:21:32,847
We're going to get killed in the marsh.
I'm not going back in there.

1068
01:21:33,014 --> 01:21:35,266
Yes, you are.
We all are because they won't.

1069
01:21:35,433 --> 01:21:37,352
Look, that was that chick's theory.
I'm going with it.

1070
01:21:37,519 --> 01:21:39,879
- We don't know that.
- Damn it, Noah. We don't have time...

1071
01:21:39,938 --> 01:21:40,939
- listen to me.
- No, you listen to me!

1072
01:21:41,106 --> 01:21:42,524
How many went into the marsh
in the first place?

1073
01:21:42,690 --> 01:21:43,900
- Seven.
- Seven. And how many came out?

1074
01:21:44,067 --> 01:21:45,068
- Five.
- Five.

1075
01:21:45,235 --> 01:21:46,611
So five of you went into that house
and you're all that's left?

1076
01:21:46,778 --> 01:21:48,863
- Yes, but...
- It's not hard math, Noah.

1077
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:51,699
We've got better odds in the marsh
than we do with the creepers.

1078
01:21:51,866 --> 01:21:54,577
Okay, okay. I'm ready.

1079

I was hoping for a better idea.

- November 11th, 1991.

- Trick question.

But we're fucking lost
and this stupid marsh is getting deeper.

a real married couple.

Aw.

really good head.

a vacation home here,

but the trees are quite lovely.

Shut up.

You can get DVDs in caves now.

- I haven't seen it.
- Oh, dude, you should totally get it.

1127
01:25:03,766 --> 01:25:06,269
I got it in college,
got me laid so many times.

1128
01:25:06,436 --> 01:25:08,688
- How's that?
- Did you woo freshmen sluts

with your Westley impression?

1130

Or fight off R.O.U.S.S
in the cafeteria?

I thought you said
you haven't seen it.

1134
01:25:20,283 --> 01:25:23,328
Look, all I know is
if I busted out a quote at a party,

1135
01:25:23,494 --> 01:25:26,039
some drunk chick would always
come up to me and be like,

1136

( high-pitched )
"Oh, my god. I love that movie.

I haven't seen it in, like, forever."

1138
01:25:29,792 --> 01:25:33,713
And I'd be like, "oh, my god.
I have it on DVD in my dorm room."

1139
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:35,340
And she'd be like,
"we should totally watch it."

1140
01:25:35,506 --> 01:25:38,384
Dude, it was so easy.
It was like stealing pussy from a baby.

1141
01:25:38,551 --> 01:25:40,178
You disgust me.

1142

Come on,
you totally would've watched it.

said they come in here.

Ah, damn it.
You're worse than them.
