Not a replica,
but the real thing.

00:27:00,479 --> 00:27:02,640
and your son will end up
in a foster home.

328
00:27:06,819 --> 00:27:10,277
I understand why you would use
such a threat...

329
00:27:10,322 --> 00:27:12,290
but you try to take him
away from me...

330
00:27:12,324 --> 00:27:13,791
I swear to you...

331
00:27:19,031 --> 00:27:20,623
I haven't seen him for years.

332
00:27:25,371 --> 00:27:26,531
[Sighs]

333
00:27:36,348 --> 00:27:37,815
SEAN: This reeks of you.

334
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,909
It's got your signature
all over it.

335
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:45,218
DIETRICH: Maybe, but you
ain't got nothin' on me...

336
00:27:45,257 --> 00:27:46,724
and you know it.

337
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:50,718
Maybe so, but I can keep you
within city limits...

338
00:27:50,763 --> 00:27:52,253
or I can talk
to your sister again.

339
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:54,458
She's right outside.

340
00:27:56,268 --> 00:27:58,896
Only this time I'll be nice.

341
00:27:59,938 --> 00:28:00,870
Hey, Sean...

342
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:03,801
how's your dead son?

343
00:28:08,514 --> 00:28:10,482
Aah!

344
00:28:13,152 --> 00:28:14,517
I don't know any--

345
00:28:14,553 --> 00:28:18,387
OK. Something about the 18th,
but that's all I know.

346
00:28:26,832 --> 00:28:31,201
TITO: Great. So we got a date.
Where the hell's the damn bomb?

347
00:28:31,236 --> 00:28:33,033
Only Pollux Troy'll know that.

348
00:28:33,072 --> 00:28:34,869
It's your call, Sean.

349
00:28:34,907 --> 00:28:37,671
SEAN:
Does Lazarro know your plan?

350
00:28:37,709 --> 00:28:40,007
HOLLIS: No.
This is a black bag operation.

351
00:28:40,045 --> 00:28:41,979
Strictly off the books.

352
00:28:42,014 --> 00:28:45,279
You can't tell Lazarro,
and you can't tell your wife.

353
00:28:47,853 --> 00:28:50,014
Oh, God.

354
00:28:50,055 --> 00:28:52,023
What are you asking me to do?

355
00:28:52,057 --> 00:28:53,524
OK, let's see.

356
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:57,620
You're asking me
to break the law...

357
00:28:57,663 --> 00:28:59,927
risk my neck...

358
00:28:59,965 --> 00:29:02,365
and you're asking me
to put in the dark...

359
00:29:02,401 --> 00:29:07,168
all the people
that love me and trust me.

360
00:29:16,815 --> 00:29:18,180
I'll do it.

361
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:28,181
[Dog barking]

362
00:29:59,856 --> 00:30:01,016
EVE: Sean.

363
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,025
Sorry I woke you.

364
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,927
I'm glad it's you
that woke me...

365
00:30:07,998 --> 00:30:09,761
and not a phone call...

366
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:11,528
telling me
you won't be coming home.

367
00:30:12,669 --> 00:30:16,002
But that's a fear
I can finally let go of, huh?

368
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:29,517
It's all right, Sean. It's OK.

369
00:30:32,389 --> 00:30:34,823
I keep...

370
00:30:34,858 --> 00:30:36,883
I keep wanting to move this...

371
00:30:36,927 --> 00:30:40,226
over here, you know?

372
00:30:40,263 --> 00:30:45,360
If it had only been an inch
to the left...

373
00:30:45,402 --> 00:30:46,494
Mikey'd be alive.

374
00:30:47,904 --> 00:30:49,769
And you wouldn't be.

375
00:30:51,841 --> 00:30:55,971
Sean, things will get better
now that you're home.

376
00:30:56,012 --> 00:30:58,480
The scar won't move,
but it will heal if you let it.

377
00:31:00,183 --> 00:31:04,051
Everything will be better.
He's out of our lives.

378
00:31:15,031 --> 00:31:18,660
Eve, if I told you
that I realized that...

379
00:31:18,702 --> 00:31:20,670
that this thing
won't fully end...

380
00:31:23,873 --> 00:31:26,433
until I did one last thing...

381
00:31:27,444 --> 00:31:29,469
Eve, something vital.

382
00:31:32,249 --> 00:31:34,046
OK, I know.

383
00:31:34,084 --> 00:31:36,109
You're going back
on assignment again.

384
00:31:38,121 --> 00:31:39,713
Just one last time.

385
00:31:41,391 --> 00:31:43,256
Come on, Eve.

386
00:31:48,131 --> 00:31:50,565
"I'm not going anywhere."
That's what you told me.

387
00:31:52,068 --> 00:31:54,536
Oh!

388
00:31:59,576 --> 00:32:00,975
You don't need me
to tell you what to do.

389
00:32:01,011 --> 00:32:03,002
You never have, so go.

390
00:32:04,447 --> 00:32:05,607
But go now.

391
00:32:32,876 --> 00:32:34,844
Sean, I'm changing my mind.

392
00:32:34,878 --> 00:32:36,846
This is a suicide mission.

393
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,314
SEAN: Yeah, I know. I know.

394
00:32:41,384 --> 00:32:44,353
Well, you know,
maybe this doctor...

395
00:32:44,387 --> 00:32:49,324
if he can do even half
of what he says he can do...

396
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:51,850
maybe it'll work. I don't know.

397
00:32:51,895 --> 00:32:54,864
I become Castor Troy,
be in control.

398
00:32:54,898 --> 00:32:57,025
TITO:
That's the part that scares me.

399
00:33:03,006 --> 00:33:05,941
Doctor, I have something...

400
00:33:07,577 --> 00:33:09,772
I have a scar that...

401
00:33:09,813 --> 00:33:14,807
If you can put this back after--
after all this is over.

402
00:33:14,851 --> 00:33:17,251
It's important to me.
It's like a reminder.

403
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:18,754
MALCOLM: Sure.

404
00:33:23,526 --> 00:33:26,256
MALCOLM: Tito, please,
hold this for me.

405
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,025
Please.

406
00:33:31,101 --> 00:33:32,329
OK, let's go.

407
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,640
Oh, God.

408
00:35:48,705 --> 00:35:51,333
TITO: Oh, my God.

409
00:37:01,644 --> 00:37:05,307
TITO: Are you OK?
Come on. Talk to me.

410
00:37:14,991 --> 00:37:17,687
Fuck you! Fuck you!

411
00:37:17,727 --> 00:37:19,126
-Fuck you!
-Sean!

412
00:37:19,162 --> 00:37:20,993
Fuck you!

413
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,056
Sean, sit down.
Sit down. Sit down.

414
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,226
Sean!

415
00:37:25,268 --> 00:37:26,394
Sean!

416
00:37:26,436 --> 00:37:27,562
Archer!

417
00:37:27,604 --> 00:37:29,367
You're Sean Archer!

418
00:37:29,405 --> 00:37:31,373
Sean Archer.

419
00:37:31,407 --> 00:37:32,965
Sean Archer.

420
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:41,615
When this is over...

421
00:37:41,651 --> 00:37:44,882
I want you to take this face...

422
00:37:44,921 --> 00:37:46,479
and burn it.

423
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,486
I still sound like me.

424
00:37:54,697 --> 00:37:56,824
MALCOLM: I've implanted
a microchip on your larynx.

425
00:37:56,866 --> 00:37:58,834
It's fantastic,
but you better be careful.

426
00:37:58,868 --> 00:38:00,301
Pressure, sharp blow...

427
00:38:00,336 --> 00:38:02,270
even a violent sneeze
could dislodge it.

428
00:38:02,305 --> 00:38:03,863
Just repeat what you hear.

429
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:07,774
CASTOR: Peach.
I can eat a peach for hours.

430
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:11,371
SEAN: Peach.
I can eat a peach for hours.

431
00:38:12,649 --> 00:38:13,911
There's a scratchy tickle.

432
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,076
Mm-hmm.

433
00:38:15,118 --> 00:38:19,111
Peach.
I can eat a peach for hours.

434
00:38:21,157 --> 00:38:24,684
Peach.
I can eat a peach for hours.

435
00:38:29,332 --> 00:38:30,799
Once again.

436
00:38:30,833 --> 00:38:33,859
Peach.
I can eat a peach for hours.

437
00:38:35,405 --> 00:38:36,531
Perfect.

438
00:38:36,572 --> 00:38:39,541
HOLLIS: Now, Sean,
six days until the 18th.

439
00:38:39,575 --> 00:38:42,408
The clock's ticking,
and so's the bomb.

440
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,639
SEAN: Yeah.

441
00:38:59,393 --> 00:39:02,055
TITO: You've got two days
to get Pollux to talk.

442
00:39:02,096 --> 00:39:05,930
Either way, Miller comes in
and pulls you out.

443
00:39:05,966 --> 00:39:07,126
You got me?

444
00:39:11,138 --> 00:39:12,469
What's the matter?

445
00:39:12,506 --> 00:39:13,734
SEAN: Face itches.

446
00:39:17,678 --> 00:39:18,906
You all right?

447
00:39:18,946 --> 00:39:20,470
Come on. Let's go.

448
00:39:24,251 --> 00:39:27,084
Archer's going to be pissed when
he comes back and finds out.

449
00:39:27,121 --> 00:39:29,282
WANDA: The guy is knee-deep
in Georgia swamp.

450
00:40:22,509 --> 00:40:25,706
GUARD: You are now the property
of Erewhon prison...

451
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,712
a citizen of nowhere.

452
00:40:28,749 --> 00:40:32,344
The Geneva Convention
is void here.

453
00:40:32,386 --> 00:40:35,583
Amnesty lnternational
doesn't know we exist.

454
00:40:35,622 --> 00:40:38,318
When I say your ass
belongs to me...

455
00:40:39,326 --> 00:40:41,021
I mean exactly that.

456
00:40:51,538 --> 00:40:54,405
This entire prison's
one big magnetic field.

457
00:40:54,441 --> 00:40:56,671
The boots tell us where you are.

458
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:59,178
Six-twenty-one to population.

459
00:42:18,492 --> 00:42:20,357
HICKS: Hey, hey, hey.
What's the matter, pal?

460
00:42:20,394 --> 00:42:23,022
Don't you remember
the little people?

461
00:42:24,364 --> 00:42:26,855
-Burke Hicks.
-Oh, yeah.

462
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,960
I busted...

463
00:42:30,003 --> 00:42:32,301
believe Sean Archer
busted you...

464
00:42:32,339 --> 00:42:33,931
for stalking
the U.N. Secretary General.

465
00:42:33,974 --> 00:42:37,501
No. Archer framed me.
I had nothing to do with that.

466
00:42:37,544 --> 00:42:40,035
Word was you got wasted.

467
00:42:48,222 --> 00:42:50,622
You want to see what wasted
looks like, little man?

468
00:42:50,657 --> 00:42:54,593
INMATES: Ooh!

469
00:42:55,562 --> 00:42:56,722
Pollux.

470
00:43:20,287 --> 00:43:21,481
GUARD: Out of the way!

471
00:43:21,522 --> 00:43:23,490
SECOND GUARD: Central, there's
a disturbance in the population.

472
00:43:23,524 --> 00:43:24,650
Go to lockdown.

473
00:43:24,691 --> 00:43:25,851
Hold that lockdown.

474
00:43:45,879 --> 00:43:48,040
DUBOV: Come on, you pussy!

475
00:43:53,453 --> 00:43:55,284
SEAN: Watch your fuckin' mouth.

476
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:58,248
Watch your fuckin' mouth!

477
00:44:09,603 --> 00:44:11,093
'Cause I'm Castor Troy!

478
00:44:11,138 --> 00:44:13,003
Yeah!

479
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,871
I'm Castor Troy!

480
00:44:14,908 --> 00:44:16,375
INMATES: Whoo! Yay!

481
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:18,037
Whoo!

482
00:44:18,078 --> 00:44:20,672
I'm Castor Troy!

483
00:44:21,682 --> 00:44:23,547
Yeah!

484
00:44:23,584 --> 00:44:24,642
Whoo!

485
00:44:28,021 --> 00:44:29,420
Yeah!

486
00:44:32,226 --> 00:44:33,818
Whoo!

487
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,760
Aah!

488
00:44:35,796 --> 00:44:37,787
Aah!

489
00:44:37,831 --> 00:44:40,595

I don't think you heard me,

When all else fails,

Fresh?
Let me tell you my fresh tactic.

Everything to do with this case
goes through me, understood?

-Hmm.
-Good!

Thanks.

-Look good?
-Mm-hmm.

Seeing that face on you
makes me afraid...

my tiramisu
might come back up.

This nose, this hair.

First, I need you to confess
to the location of the bomb.

What about our $10 million?

01:00:42,654 --> 01:00:46,385
What about when I become
a hero for defusing the bomb?

715
01:00:46,425 --> 01:00:48,985
What's that worth? Know that.

where an FBI agent
became a city savior.

just one second before
it was set to blow.

within a mile of the scene.

giving him a message.

1469
02:09:43,872 --> 02:09:46,204
Die!

1470
02:10:04,259 --> 02:10:06,352
CASTOR: [Singing] Ready...

1471
02:10:06,395 --> 02:10:10,263
Ready for the big ride...

1472
02:10:10,299 --> 02:10:12,096
Baby.

1473
02:10:12,134 --> 02:10:13,726
[Sirens]

1474
02:10:17,727 --> 02:10:19,327
Off of Pico in the middle
of the street.

1475
02:10:27,383 --> 02:10:29,044
BUZZ: You OK, Archer?

1476
02:10:33,756 --> 02:10:35,849
What did you call me?

1477
02:10:35,891 --> 02:10:37,552
He called you Archer, sir.

1478
02:10:51,373 --> 02:10:52,840
EVE: Sean.

1479
02:10:52,875 --> 02:10:55,469
They're bringing in their top
surgical team from D.C.

1480
02:10:55,511 --> 02:10:56,842
You're going to be OK.

1481
02:11:27,676 --> 02:11:29,610
[Siren]

1482
02:11:42,691 --> 02:11:46,889
DOCTOR: When you wake up,
everything will be restored...

1483
02:11:46,929 --> 02:11:48,191
just the way it was.

1484
02:11:50,299 --> 02:11:51,994
My scar.

1485
02:11:53,268 --> 02:11:55,566
The one near my heart?

1486
02:11:55,604 --> 02:11:57,970
This old bullet wound...

1487
02:11:58,006 --> 02:12:00,668
I won't need it anymore.

1488
02:12:00,709 --> 02:12:01,903
DOCTOR: OK.

1489
02:13:00,135 --> 02:13:01,432
Dad?

1490
02:13:14,650 --> 02:13:16,743
Dad?

1491
02:13:18,186 --> 02:13:19,949
I'm sorry I shot you.

1492
02:13:28,764 --> 02:13:31,426
I've got something
to ask both of you.

1493
02:13:42,978 --> 02:13:45,572
This is Adam.

1494
02:13:46,648 --> 02:13:48,775
And he needs a place to live.

1495
02:13:51,019 --> 02:13:52,281
JAMIE: Hi.

1496
02:13:52,321 --> 02:13:54,289
My name's Jamie.

1497
02:13:55,591 --> 02:13:57,286
I'm Adam.

1498
02:13:59,061 --> 02:14:01,495
SEAN: Why don't you show Adam
his new room?

1499
02:14:01,530 --> 02:14:03,054
JAMIE: Come on.

1500
02:14:05,133 --> 02:14:06,964
EVE: OK.

1501
02:15:02,187 --> 02:15:03,677
INXS: [Singing]
You shot your mouth off...

1502
02:15:03,722 --> 02:15:06,657
Iike a kid who's scared
to have a heart.

1503
02:15:06,692 --> 02:15:08,683
Losing grip
of what really matters...

1504
02:15:08,727 --> 02:15:10,786
'cause you don't know
where to start.

1505
02:15:10,829 --> 02:15:12,729
You wake up in the morning...

1506
02:15:12,764 --> 02:15:14,857
with a starfuck for a friend.

1507
02:15:14,900 --> 02:15:16,959
The things you do
are so in tune...

1508
02:15:17,002 --> 02:15:19,129
with what you're gonna hate.

1509
02:15:19,171 --> 02:15:21,332
What's giving you
the will to live?

1510
02:15:21,373 --> 02:15:23,136
Is it looking for revenge?

1511
02:15:23,175 --> 02:15:25,507
The only life
that you've got left...

1512
02:15:25,544 --> 02:15:27,478
is hiding from the pain.

1513
02:15:27,512 --> 02:15:29,707
What must have happened
to your soul...

1514
02:15:29,748 --> 02:15:31,545
is skinning you alive.

1515
02:15:31,583 --> 02:15:33,847
The thing
you fear the most is love...

1516
02:15:33,885 --> 02:15:39,118
and that's buried deep inside.

1517
02:15:39,157 --> 02:15:40,556
Yeah.

1518
02:15:40,592 --> 02:15:43,652
So deep inside.

1519
02:15:43,695 --> 02:15:47,961
Don't lose your head.

1520
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:51,834
'Cause I can't do the time.

1521
02:15:51,870 --> 02:15:56,364
Don't lose your head.

1522
02:15:56,408 --> 02:16:00,538
Or can you pay the price?

1523
02:16:00,579 --> 02:16:03,047
The heart you're building
out of rock...

1524
02:16:03,081 --> 02:16:05,015
is turning into sand.

1525
02:16:05,050 --> 02:16:07,245
'Cause you never
took the time to think...

1526
02:16:07,285 --> 02:16:08,912
what it means to be a man.

1527
02:16:08,954 --> 02:16:11,081
You act like you got
the answer...

1528
02:16:11,123 --> 02:16:13,216
when the question's
never asked.

1529
02:16:13,258 --> 02:16:15,488
I've been to where
you're coming from...

1530
02:16:15,527 --> 02:16:17,518
but the postcards
weren't so bad.

1531
02:16:17,562 --> 02:16:19,621
The knife I carry's
been sharpened...

1532
02:16:19,664 --> 02:16:21,655
on the mouths
that won't keep shut.

1533
02:16:21,700 --> 02:16:23,668
I'll stab at you
in the darkness...

1534
02:16:23,702 --> 02:16:25,932
'cause I'm trying
to shed some light.

1535
02:16:25,971 --> 02:16:27,836
Your point of view's
so meaningless...

1536
02:16:27,873 --> 02:16:30,068
if you ever had one at all.

1537
02:16:30,108 --> 02:16:36,013
All you seem to care about
is who's gonna take the fall.

1538
02:16:37,182 --> 02:16:40,481
Who's gonna take
the fall for you?

1539
02:16:42,187 --> 02:16:45,987
Don't lose your head.

1540
02:16:46,024 --> 02:16:50,051
I can't do the time for you.

1541
02:16:50,629 --> 02:16:55,089
Don't lose your head.

1542
02:16:55,133 --> 02:16:58,500
Can you pay the price?

1543
02:17:23,595 --> 02:17:25,028
Yeah.

1544
02:17:25,831 --> 02:17:27,321
Mama.

1545
02:17:32,204 --> 02:17:36,231
Don't lose your head.

1546
02:17:36,274 --> 02:17:40,608
'Cause I can't do the time.

1547
02:17:40,645 --> 02:17:45,082
Don't lose your head.

1548
02:17:45,117 --> 02:17:48,814
Can you pay the price?

1549
02:17:48,854 --> 02:17:53,450
Don't lose your head.

1550
02:17:53,492 --> 02:17:56,359
'Cause I can't do the time.

1551
02:17:57,529 --> 02:18:01,363
Don't lose your head.

1552
02:18:01,399 --> 02:18:05,495
Can you pay the price?

1553
02:18:05,537 --> 02:18:10,065
Don't lose your head.

1554
02:18:10,108 --> 02:18:12,838
You can't do the time.

1555
02:18:13,912 --> 02:18:18,713
No, don't lose your head.

1556
02:18:18,750 --> 02:18:24,382
You cannot pay the price.

1557
02:18:24,422 --> 02:18:30,986
If you can't pay the price.

1558
02:18:31,029 --> 02:18:34,829
Don't lose your head.

1559
02:18:34,866 --> 02:18:38,131
You know I can't do the time.

1560
02:18:38,170 --> 02:18:41,105
You ain't worth it to me.

1561
02:18:41,139 --> 02:18:44,631
You ain't worth it to me.

1562
02:18:45,532 --> 02:20:44,632
