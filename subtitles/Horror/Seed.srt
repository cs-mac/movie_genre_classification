ALL THAT IT EXISTS
Is it worth TO DESTRUCTION

2
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,300
SEED

2

STATE LAW:
A prisoner,...

00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,033
must be set free.

7
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,700
That you have done well.

8
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,700
I-I can not believe what I just saw.
This is my last time.

9
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:25,033
I do not ...
- I wrote many letters to all of your complaints.

10
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,300
You get an entirely new job.
I promise you.

11
00:04:31,033 --> 00:04:33,871
That you have done well.
You did your job.

12
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,400
Right, I ... I did my work.

13
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,233
He is!

14
00:05:20,633 --> 00:05:21,500
You see him?

15
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,990
He is!
It is the serial killer.

16
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,800
Do you hear what I say?
Stop the bus!

17
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,100
Everyone, from the bus, now!

18
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,000
Stop! Listen.
He is.

19
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,400
Do you not?

20
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,300
Can anybody hear me? It is him,
you see him?

21
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,000
You see not about who I am?

22
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,600
What are you doing?

23
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,233
What are you doing?
... No!

24
00:06:29,233 --> 00:06:31,000
Do not.

25
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,200
Stop the bus!

26
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,000
Give me ...

27
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,600
Stop the bus!

28
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,033
Give the baby to me!

29
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,633
Come on, give the baby!

30
00:06:49,633 --> 00:06:51,700
My God!

Worst SERIAL KILLER
EVER IN THE U.S.

34
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:33,500
MAX IS THE SEED
SUFFERTON killer.

35
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,000
SEED WILL executed
BE BY ELECTRIC CHAIR

36
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
SEED'S TERRORIST
1973-1979

37
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,800
DETECTIEVE Matt Bishop
HERO BY JUDGMENT OF SEED

38
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,300
We have post, boss.
- Hopefully the right.

39
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,700
Yet not as far as I know.

40
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I do not know how many letters I wrote.

41
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,700
And how many calls I have committed.
Nothing.

42
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,600
No approval
the new electric chair.

43
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,600
We have him next week, boss.

44
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,300
I know. It must happen with the old.

45
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,000
Fantastic.

46
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'll let him know.

47
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,300
Any last wishes, Seed?

48
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,233
Want a priest speak?

49
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,100
Some meal?

50
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:04,700
What is this?
- I do not know.

51
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,100
Are you sure this is our prisoner?
- Yes, most certainly.

52
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,300
Why would a guy who masses
people killed,

53
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,300
important to find rats?

54
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,233
He tries to tell us something.

55
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,033
It succeeds at anything.

56
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,500
It looks like someone's pet.

57
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,500
Damn.

58
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,400
Sick bastard.

59
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,500
My God, you know that there
a missing child in the street 14.

60
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,700
Damn.

61
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,000
This is some sick joke.

62
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,500
PROOF

63
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,500
My God.

64
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,700
What are you saying?

65
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,500
What does this mean?

66
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,033
You're right.
This street is not indicated.

67
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:12,600
Never mind.
I hunt a lot in this neighborhood.

68
00:15:13,233 --> 00:15:15,000
I know this area well.

69
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,100
Are you a little tense?

70
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,633
Is it?
- Yes.

71
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,633
Gwen Dennis Road.
Here it is.

72
00:15:59,633 --> 00:16:00,700
Please.

73
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,300
She took her good toegetakeld.

74
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,633
They should have fought back.
- Is it really?

75
00:16:04,633 --> 00:16:06,133
When it was classified?

76
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,633
The dates are met.

77
00:16:12,633 --> 00:16:14,300
<i> Please! </ i></i>

78
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,233
<i> Let me go! </ i></i>

79
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,200
<i> Come in here to bother you
hell can murder! </ i></i>

80
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,200
<i> Let me go! </ i></i>

81
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,800
<i> Please! </ i></i>

82
00:16:55,633 --> 00:16:57,700
If you still have that
ten dollars that you need me?

83
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,500
I have ten dollars.

84
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,700
We should all put together $ 50
for those who begin this bastard.

85
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:18,300
It's so damn dark here,
this upcoming me.

86
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,033
How many houses are here?

87
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:29,033
The moon is almost there, then there is some light.
- If it is not raining.

88
00:17:31,033 --> 00:17:32,000
Understood.

89
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,500
What is that?

90
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,200
God, that's disgusting.

91
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,300
Jesus.

92
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,000
Look at her.

93
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,700
ONGOING LOS SERIAL KILLER?
POLICE IS DIFFERENT TIMES

94
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,033
Murderer succeeds TOE AGAIN

95
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,500
What do you think about Bishop?

96
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,033
We had it to Ward should leave.

97
00:18:48,033 --> 00:18:51,100
I would not want to be Ward
with Bishop drive.

98
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,300
He lost control a bit.

99
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,500
He does not talk a lot, eh?

100
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,100
It's like I said ...

101
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,100
We talked to Ward should leave.
He is closely involved.

102
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,433
Best a tense atmosphere.

103
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,400
Let us hope that this track is real.

104
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,500
Okay, guys, be careful.
We do not want heroes.

105
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,500
We want him down.

106
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,000
Flynn and Jeffrey,
you occupy the area.

107
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,100
Ward?
- Sir?

108
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,800
You got the point.
- Got it.

109
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,633
Forward!

110
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,300
Search the floor.
Find the basement.

111
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,300
I inspect the top.

112
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,400
What is that?

113
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,800
Herpak yourself, Ward.

114
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,200
Damn!

115
00:24:49,433 --> 00:24:51,600
Come on, where are you?

116
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,100
Damn!

118
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,200
Simpson?

119
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,633
Damn!

120
00:28:59,633 --> 00:29:00,633
Damn, Jeffrey.

121
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Flynn!

122
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,000
Damn it, Jesus.

123
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Come out of the car!

124
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,233
Forward!

125
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,500
Come out!

126
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,200
Get up!

127
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,300
Forward.
Get up!

128
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,500
Get up!

129
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,300
Come on!

130
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,100
I can murder you on the spot!

131
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,100
<i> I can murder you on the spot! </ i></i>

132
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,200
Seed, this is your big day.

133
00:32:26,866 --> 00:32:28,300
We go a day without geet equivalent of them.

134
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,500
You will be someone's bitch tonight.
Come on, get right!

135
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,100
Something to remind us.

136
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,033
I am even enjoying this.

137
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,100
Security!

138
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,400
CHILD LIVES ON ACCIDENT VURIG

139
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:52,400
JONGEN LUCK TO SURVIVAL
OF FIRE

140
00:33:58,633 --> 00:34:04,800
Help me!

141
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,400
DIRECTOR OF PRISON SUFFERTON

142
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,500
Execute

143
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,400
Got something to say?

144
00:35:45,033 --> 00:35:48,400
Would you excuse not to
the families of the victims?

145
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,000
Okay, listen ...

146
00:36:13,233 --> 00:36:16,033
we should postpone this execution.
And you know that.

147
00:36:16,033 --> 00:36:21,200
This chair can not.
We have standards here, I have standards.

148
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,500
Calm down.
- Remember the last time?

149
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,500
It was the fourth July!
- Calm down!

150
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,633
We execute him tonight.

151
00:36:30,033 --> 00:36:31,200
Tonight!

152
00:36:32,033 --> 00:36:34,800
You said last time was the last time.

153
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,500
You promised it.

154
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,700
Do your job.
- Do my work.

155
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,100
Do my damn job.

156
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,700
External signs are present.


157
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,500
Heartbeat present.

158
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,000
It is over.

159
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,100
We wish you a
horrible sight saving.

160
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,700
And you ask to leave the area.

161
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,800
Thank you for your arrival.

162
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,000
He is dead, eh?

163
00:41:36,033 --> 00:41:37,000
Of course.

164
00:41:44,233 --> 00:41:46,700
We are three failures,
we have a problem.

165
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:50,633
We are not more than three attempts allowed.
- Can you assure me ...

166
00:41:51,313 --> 00:41:53,600
damn that my position is protected here?

167
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:59,400
That means that we get him to
the hospital should bring.

168
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,600
And he continues to live as a freak, blind
and fried brains.

169

You buried him alive, man.

And everyone knows that!

175
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:42,600
Just remember, ...

176
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,633
that karma is a bitch.

177
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,500
And I can not wait until
it takes you to graze.

178
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,400
Seed?

179
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,733
Please.

180
00:49:05,733 --> 00:49:07,800
Lots of butter.

Can I have something for you, honey?

182
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,700
Look at what we?

183
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
A movie about vampires.

184
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,300
But ...

185
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,700
it's boring.

186
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:42,900
That is regrettable.

187
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,033
I go to my room, I think.

188
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,200

Why not?

194
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,433
A nightmare.

195
00:57:56,833 --> 00:57:58,200
About what?

196
00:58:01,633 --> 00:58:04,700
Well, Em, guests
which I work together ...

197
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:10,600
did a very bad thing.
And I stopped them, while I could.

198
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,500
What have they done?

199
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,500
They took the law into their own hands.

200
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:28,500
And now we are criminals.

201
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:31,400
And you?

202
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:37,900

Have you caught it?

205
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,433
No, I woke up.

206
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:55,800
Well.

207
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,500
Want to hear something funny?

208
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:05,900
I had a dream ...

209
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,500
I ate a giant marshmallow.

210
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:12,400
And when I woke up,
was there on my pillow geknabbeld.

211
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,100
Have you dreamed of something else?

212
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,233
I had a dream where ...

213
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,233
you die.

214
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:41,633
Baby.

215
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,100
Nobody comes in here ...

216
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:18,200

What do you want, Davis?

226
01:02:49,433 --> 01:02:52,400
I want you to do this correctly.

227
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,300
If these murders continue to occur,

228
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:56,233
will the public know that it is Seed,

229
01:02:56,233 --> 01:02:58,433
and the department will address.

230
01:02:58,433 --> 01:03:00,600
We had never been so may bury him.

231
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:03,000
Okay, we had him alive
may be buried.

232
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Then you had him in the forehead should shoot,

233
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,100
and to ensure that
he remained underground.

234
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:12,300
But you did not. So you must find him
and murder him.

235
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:16,400
And I want you begraafd him,
so he never comes back.

236
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,100
That bastard has five good agents murdered.

237
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:22,100
Your best friends ...
- Five good cops, my agents.

238
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:25,233
But he was unarmed, unprotected ...

239
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:29,700
I had to kill him?
- That I had done.

240
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:34,233
Do not worry about the right to do so.

241
01:03:34,233 --> 01:03:36,100
Just that you're a cop.

242
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,000
I will make sure.

Whatever he says, do we.

Listen ...

292
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:26,200
I could shoot a bullet through you,
but I did not, remember?

293
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:27,300
Come on, man.

<i> He wants you to suicide.
- What? </ I></i>

297
01:18:39,133 --> 01:18:41,600
He wants you to shoot yourself.

298
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,700
Do not!

299
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:48,500
He killed us.
- No, come here.

300
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:50,800
Take the gun and shoot me down himself.

301
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:53,500
That is the deal.
But do not touch it.

302
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:55,700
Seed, they had nothing ...

303

You need to come here and murder me.

308
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:13,000
They have nothing ...
They have done nothing wrong.

309

Please, come here.

310
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:16,233
Come here to kill me!
