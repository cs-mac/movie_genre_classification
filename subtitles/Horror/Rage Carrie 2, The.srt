{10948}{11006}Was the dog in the house last night?

{11173}{11241}l only let him in this morning.
{11279}{11323}There´s no juice.
{11325}{11379}We´re out of a lot of things.
{11381}{11476}l heard dog noises last night|when l was trying to sleep.
{11478}{11539}Walter was not in the house last night.
{11541}{11592}That voice!
{11594}{11657}As long as you´re under this roof...
{11659}{11765}you´ll respect us as your parents|and treat us like that.
{11767}{11813}Sorry.
{11850}{11952}Take it easy, Boyd.|She might not be with us much longer.
{11954}{12036}Your mom´s making progress, right?

{12270}{12319}May l be excused?
{12482}{12525}Well, hello.
{12527}{12582}Oh, she speaks.
{12619}{12693}Her mouth opens, and sounds come out.
{12695}{12802}She didn´t call all weekend.|l figured her voice was gone.
{12804}{12886}What´s wrong?|Foster dad being a pain again?
{12888}{12931}Yeah.
{12973}{13065}Why are you so weirdly happy?

{15246}{15325}how many points do l get|if l do that chick over there?
{15327}{15397}The fat one? Six.
{15399}{15490}No, bro, l did her last week and you|only gave me five. And she´s not fat.
{15492}{15586}Yeah, but l figure if he´s got the balls|to go in after you, you dirty shit...
{15588}{15646}l´m giving him an extra point.
{15710}{15826}- Hey, guys.|- Oh, Jesse, that Tracy girl.
{15828}{15899}You gotta get all over that girl, man.
{15901}{15944}Serious, bro.

{16013}{16077}She got an ass stamped B.P., baby!
{16079}{16141}Bulldog property.
{16241}{16307}Can you develop these at work for me?
{16559}{16641}- Total coyote date.|- That´s harsh, bro.
{16643}{16686}lt´s the truth.
{16688}{16767}- What´s a coyote date?|- You don´t know?
{16769}{16873}That´s when you wake up in the morning,|some ugly chick sleeping on your arm...
{16875}{16962}and you´d rather gnaw it off|than have to wake her up.
{17040}{17106}God, woman, you come prepared.
{17159}{17217}Tell me who the special someone is.
{17219}{17301}All will be revealed in due time.
{17857}{17957}""Romeo and Juliet,"" a tale...
{17959}{18094}of star-crossed lovers, pulled apart|by their families, society...
{18096}{18204}and, some might say, by fate.
{18206}{18361}Why is it that we are so moved by love|that ends with separation?
{18363}{18406}What say?
{18434}{18477}Anyone.
{18514}{18560}Anyone!
{18759}{18821}l don´t know that l believe in it.
{18823}{18881}Believe in what?
{18905}{18948}Love.
{18950}{19114}Well, then you´ve got bigger problems|than passing this class.
{19116}{19209}- Who would love her?|- Yes, Arnold.
{19211}{19323}""Love is 15 seconds|of squishing noises.""
{19325}{19389}Unquote. Johnny Rotten.|Know what l´m saying?
{19391}{19473}Dork. Kill that kid.
{19475}{19537}Do you think all love stories|are tragedies?
{19564}{19624}Unless they die at the same time...
{19626}{19746}all lovers are eventually separated|by death, right?
{19799}{19923}Then ""Romeo and Juliet"" isn´t a tragedy.|They could only be together in death.
{19925}{20031}Yes! Very good!
{20056}{20135}A foul cynic, most cliche.
{20137}{20292}- A true romantic. How refreshing!|- Yeah.

{20999}{21074}Oh, hello there.

{28279}{28343}One of our students died today.
{28387}{28506}We will observe at exactly 1:00 p.m.|a moment of silence.
{28670}{28728}- Lisa Parker may be gone.|- Hand me the score book.

{28838}{28933}She will not be forgotten|by her fellow students.
{28935}{28998}She will not be forgotten|by her teachers...
{29026}{29104}or by her school.
{29636}{29709}Her parents are going to want|all this.
{29937}{29988}Oh, my.
{29990}{30048}That girl Lisa, right?

{30339}{30483}You guys thought she was shit, right?|Mark.
{30485}{30548}Don´t look at me like this. You guys|said it. You thought she was shit.
{30550}{30593}What did you do?
{30595}{30657}Nothing. l didn´t do anything.
{30721}{30863}lt´s just Lisa was acting all happy,|you know, like we were going steady.
{30865}{30957}And l had to break the news to her|that she was just a pump.
{30959}{31013}You know, a nut.
{31015}{31086}She didn´t mean anything to me.
{31153}{31233}l guess she couldn´t handle it.
{31278}{31358}ls that your brilliant attempt|to fix it?
{31405}{31466}That´s good.
{31468}{31589}You need all the points you can get.|l don´t know why you´re erasing them.
{31591}{31649}That´s cold, man.
{31725}{31844}On Friday we have the Kings University|scout coming to the game.
{31883}{31944}lf all this gets out--|Sex and suicide.
{31975}{32067}Come on, man. Catholic schools|frown on that shit.
{32125}{32216}lf l don´t get into a good school,|my dad´s gonna kill me.
{32247}{32308}But nobody´s gonna find out about this.
{32410}{32472}Lisa took a picture of us last night.
{32528}{32606}What if her parents ask questions?
{32608}{32666}That´s a problem.

{35156}{35231}- Yeah.|- Rachel, listen. That Lisa girl?
{35233}{35356}She had these pictures that have|what you might call sentimental value.

{35542}{35612}What do you want, 30?
{35614}{35684}They´re not your pictures.
{35686}{35773}lt´s not like she´s gonna be|pickin´ them anytime soon, is it?

{36246}{36304}Unless you want me to.
{36346}{36389}l don´t think so.
{36391}{36437}Why not?
{36566}{36609}Because l´m a dyke.

{36827}{36896}- Don´t laugh, man.|- Just drive.
{38016}{38076}How you doin´ tonight?
{38159}{38255}""For a moment, l thought someone|was actually seeing me...

{38322}{38427}Eric lied when he said l was special,|and l guess l was lying to myself.
{38429}{38487}l believed him.""
{38489}{38636}Rachel, is there anything in there|that strikes a chord for you?
{38681}{38761}Do you know what Lisa|was referring to?
{38871}{38934}Yesterday, she--
{39029}{39109}She told me she lost her virginity.
{39111}{39179}Do you know this boy?
{39181}{39246}Eric Stark.
{39248}{39302}He´s on the team.
{39304}{39362}Can l talk to you for a second?
{39364}{39424}Excuse us, Rachel.
{39523}{39625}Robbie, l had a freshman girl crying|in the hallway last week.
{39627}{39716}Five more have been in my office|this semester.
{39718}{39830}l couldn´t get anything out of them,|but their friends told me...
{39832}{39953}that football players slept with them|then dumped them.
{39955}{40020}There´s nothing illegal|about breaking a girl´s heart.
{40022}{40089}Eric is 18.
{40091}{40154}Lisa was 16.|That´s statutory rape.
{40156}{40199}That´s a stretch.
{40201}{40346}Let´s make it before someone else´s|daughter jumps off a building.
{40399}{40446}Listen.
{40448}{40561}Are you sure you´re still not trying|to save a girl that died 20 years ago?
{40623}{40666}Help me!
{40701}{40777}Plug it up! Plug it up!
{41027}{41138}Okay. l´ll look into it.

{43334}{43392}What are you thinking about?
{43424}{43467}Nobody.
{43507}{43572}l asked what, not who.
{43574}{43636}lt´s nothing.
{43753}{43894}Doesn´t it bother you that some girl|offed herself yesterday?
{43924}{44017}- Why? She wasn´t anybody.|- What?
{44019}{44119}l mean, l didn´t know her.
{44258}{44394}You know, l still don´t have a date|for Mark´s party.

{51353}{51406}Sorry.
{51408}{51451}For what?
{51529}{51616}For making you come out here|all this way.
{51618}{51672}Don´t worry about it.
{51674}{51743}And what about my windshield?|How bizarre was that?
{51745}{51819}l´m sorry about your car.
{51821}{51932}lt wasn´t your fault.|lt was probably a rock or something.
{52044}{52102}Walter´s banged up pretty bad.
{52104}{52162}Has broken ribs.
{52164}{52258}He tore an artery in his front leg.|He´s lost quite a bit of blood.
{52260}{52314}His pressure´s stabilized.
{52316}{52416}He´s gonna make it.
{52418}{52496}- Can l see him?|- Come back tomorrow.
{52498}{52547}Any time after 8:00.
{52777}{52882}Don´t worry. lt´s because you look|like a mass murderer.
{53083}{53141}What´s up with the music here?
{53143}{53225}Don´t they have anything good,|like some Garbage?
{53227}{53328}- You like Garbage?|- Yeah. Shirley Manson, she rocks.
{53477}{53536}Lisa loved her.
{53662}{53728}You two were really close, huh?
{53868}{53933}l´m really sorry.
{53971}{54014}Sometimes...
{54075}{54169}l´d see someone from behind...
{54171}{54241}and l´d know...
{54243}{54361}l´d just know it was Lisa.
{54398}{54478}And she´d turn around,|and it wasn´t.
{54480}{54556}But sometimes it was.
{54558}{54601}And now...
{54663}{54776}whenever l see someone who looks|like her, and she turns around...
{54839}{54897}it won´t be.
{54949}{54992}Ever.
{55425}{55483}lt´s gettin´ pretty late.

{55627}{55672}Yeah, right.
{55701}{55759}l can hitch. Don´t worry about it.
{55761}{55836}Then you can go hitch.
{55838}{55903}Or l could just...
{55947}{56017}wait for my limo.
{56019}{56090}Yeah, you could do that.
{56092}{56148}Just wait for your limo.

{58145}{58188}Lisa!
{58276}{58382}Don´t! Don´t jump!
{59424}{59499}Last night, l took a look at your file.

{60719}{60813}Yeah, well, l try.
{60919}{60977}Do you visit your mom often?
{61073}{61134}ls that scary for you?
{61192}{61237}What do you mean?
{61239}{61369}lt´s perfectly normal to be afraid|of turning out like your parents.
{61371}{61435}Come on.
{61437}{61526}l know l´m ten times more likely|to get it than most people.
{61557}{61617}l didn´t mean to patronize you.
{61657}{61772}So, is that scary for you?
{61966}{62004}Rachel...
{62057}{62171}in a way you´ve lost your mother...
{62173}{62246}and now you´ve lost a friend.
{62282}{62352}Losing people close to you can be...

{67848}{67959}- And what´d you say?|- l said, ""Okay. lt´s your funeral.""
{67990}{68069}Well, okay, pardon me.
{68071}{68176}But is hanging out with jock-boy|such a hot idea?

{68304}{68383}And she--
{68385}{68484}Right now she´s giving you the look|of a thousand deaths.

{69281}{69385}Somebody told him l did Lisa, and|l´m suspended. My dad´s gonna kill me.
{69387}{69463}- What about the game?|- Who cares?
{69465}{69567}Kelton nailed me with a picture of Lisa|and l, started talking statutory rape.
{69569}{69648}Now l face the D.A. on Thursday.
{69650}{69725}Relax. lt´s bullshit, all right?
{69727}{69853}Your dad´s gonna kick your ass, but he´s|a lawyer, and he´ll kill that shit dead.

{81346}{81408}All of what?
{81483}{81587}Guys like you are supposed to date|girls like Tracy, okay?
{81621}{81735}That´s what this is about?|No. Hold on.

{83808}{83936}l´m a friend who gives a shit that my|boy´s goin´ down for rape. That´s who.
{83938}{84023}l´m gonna do anything l gotta do|to keep her from fuckin´ talkin´.

{84180}{84240}- Deal with you?|- Deal with me.
{84242}{84328}No. You´re gonna have to deal with me.
{84438}{84518}What is wrong with you, Jesse?
{84520}{84618}This is us, man!|We´re all friends here.

{85237}{85352}False?|l don´t see the point.

{88053}{88128}l can´t believe l´m telling you this.
{88168}{88245}l never told anybody this before|in my life.
{88369}{88472}lt must be nice not having to be|like everybody else.
{88554}{88612}lt´s not so great.
{88656}{88701}l mean...
{88703}{88835}sometimes l wish l could just be|one of the shiny, happy people.
{88910}{88962}Does that surprise you?
{88964}{89007}Yeah.
{89068}{89138}Everything about you surprises me.
{89898}{89993}l knew this guy once.|He did this thing.
{90039}{90116}He could suck a strand of spaghetti...
{90118}{90223}up his mouth|and right out of his nose.
{90225}{90268}Brain flossing?
{90309}{90367}He called it a talent.
{90430}{90519}l bet you´re wondering|where l´m going with this, right?
{90589}{90632}Well--
{90682}{90782}You really have a talent.|You´ve got football.
{90820}{90952}lt´ll get you out of this place.|After that, you can do what you want.

{91082}{91163}- Think so?|- Word.
{91165}{91217}Word?
{91219}{91262}Word.
{91370}{91436}You wanna come with me?

{92384}{92500}Your brake.|lt´s poking me right in the back.
{92567}{92610}You wanna--
{92804}{92898}l really don´t know how to say this.
{92900}{92959}What?
{92961}{93004}l´ve never--
{93156}{93199}Yeah.
{93260}{93376}- And l want it to be special.|- Yeah.
{93378}{93535}Like, you come to my door|with flowers in your hand.
{93603}{93684}Oh, well, okay.
{93781}{93875}What kind of flowers|do you like?
{93935}{93978}Daisies.
{94042}{94117}Okay. l´ll have to remember that.
{94366}{94462}l don´t know! l don´t know!
{94870}{94998}Mrs. Lang, l need to ask you|a few questions about Rachel.
{95046}{95089}Who is--
{95114}{95182}Who is her father?
{95184}{95235}lt isn´t important.
{95237}{95340}- l knew you´d come back.|- l´m afraid we don´t know each other.
{95342}{95408}We can still get married.|l´ll marry you.
{95410}{95511}- l need to know who he is.|- l´m sorry, that´s private.
{95513}{95605}The hell with them!|What do they know?
{95607}{95719}Cut it out! She´s not Terry.|Kindly go away.
{95844}{95949}Poor thing. He´s never had a visitor.|Wants to share everybody else´s.
{96049}{96120}Mrs. Lang, it´s very important...
{96122}{96243}that you tell me|who Rachel´s father is.
{96245}{96312}l don´t see how that´s|any of your business.
{96314}{96372}l´m trying to help Rachel.
{96374}{96453}She seems troubled,|and l´m very worried about her.
{96492}{96594}You´re worried?|Are you very worried?
{96596}{96639}l am, yes.
{96641}{96729}You don´t have any children,|do you, miss?
{96731}{96789}No, l don´t.
{96889}{97038}Then you don´t know. You will never know|how terrifying children can be.
{97078}{97185}Mrs. Lang, l know this is|a really strange question...
{97187}{97247}but when Rachel was growing up...
{97249}{97329}did you ever see objects move|by themselves?
{97389}{97484}And did the doctors convince you|it was all your imagination?
{97486}{97566}The Lord is with thee.|No. l was crazy then.
{97568}{97656}l thought she was possessed.|l thought the devil was inside her.
{97689}{97790}Mrs. Lang, Rachel needs help.
{97792}{97921}She may have a disease,|a genetic disorder.
{97923}{98009}l believe her father|may have passed it on to her.
{98011}{98089}Disease? Could l have it?|Did l give it to her?
{98091}{98144}- No.|- How do you know?
{98146}{98208}Because the male is the carrier.
{98210}{98314}Mrs. Lang, you must tell me his name.
{98372}{98453}Holy Mary, mother of God,|pray for us sinners...
{98455}{98529}now and at the hour of our death, amen.
{98617}{98689}l did tell Rachel once|how we met.
{98740}{98798}He said it was love at first sight.
{98851}{98939}l´ll tell you, but don´t you dare|hurt my daughter.
{99002}{99093}l never told her ´cause|people around here...
{99095}{99181}aren´t so fond of Carrie White|´cause of what she did.
{99211}{99310}See, he was her daddy, too.
{99358}{99421}His name was Ralph.
{99457}{99530}Ralph White.
{99756}{99799}Rachel?
{99850}{99914}l need you to come with me.
{100149}{100212}The night of the prom...
{100266}{100341}73 people died.
{100399}{100482}A few of us survived...
{100484}{100558}but we´ve never talked about that night.
{100688}{100794}That´s why l ended up at Arkham,|if you wondered.
{100796}{100889}l witnessed something|l can´t even begin to tell you about.
{100921}{101010}But look around.|See for yourself.
{101012}{101130}This was the original high school.
{101132}{101201}l wish they´d tear this place down.
{101203}{101281}lt´s like some twisted memorial|to that night.
{101362}{101443}l haven´t been here in over 20 years.
{101480}{101523}Happy homecoming.
{101552}{101612}You´ve heard of Carrie White,|haven´t you?
{101643}{101716}Supposedly she set the fire...
{101718}{101854}as some type of revenge-suicide thing.
{101856}{101946}Elvis was her date,|and they escaped in a UFO.
{102041}{102121}l know what happened|to that snow dome on my desk.
{102191}{102256}lt fell.
{102258}{102316}We both know.
{102450}{102551}Rachel, is Jesse Ryan pressuring you--
{102553}{102612}Excuse me.|That´s none of your business.
{102614}{102715}l know everything there is to know|about Carrie White.
{102784}{102813}She did this.
{102874}{102965}lt began with something like you did|with the snow dome...
{102967}{103025}and then it got out of control.
{103064}{103123}- l´m leaving.|- Rachel.
{103152}{103300}- lt´s a genetic recessive trait.|- What are you saying l have?
{103302}{103425}l´m saying you´re not crazy,|and it´s not the devil.
{103427}{103523}lt´s a trait you´ve inherited.
{103525}{103636}Telekinesis: the ability|to move objects with your mind.
{103678}{103756}For years, l didn´t believe it existed.
{103758}{103818}But there are places that study it.
{103820}{103890}There´s a lab at Princeton.|l can take you there.
{103892}{103957}With all respect, lady...
{103959}{104045}you are seriously bat shit.
{104047}{104116}l´m walking back to the real world now.
{104118}{104205}You mother told me your father|is Carrie´s father.
{104207}{104290}No, my father´s name was Bill Kirk.
{104292}{104382}- He left when l was three months old.|- lt´s a lie.
{104384}{104436}My mother wouldn´t lie to me.
{104438}{104503}Believe me, you need help.
{104505}{104575}Like what?|Like they helped you?
{104577}{104672}l can help you to get it under control.
{104674}{104770}l don´t want or need your help.
{104851}{104952}You´re not really thinking|of pressing charges against my son?
{104954}{105016}Oh, we´re doing more than thinking.
{105059}{105129}Look, Eric´s a good kid.
{105131}{105214}He may be guilty|of some youthful transgressions--
{105216}{105325}Youthful transgressions?|A girl killed herself, Lou.
{105371}{105411}Hello, Jay.
{105413}{105491}Sit. Everybody sit.
{105493}{105572}l´m just listening in.
{105595}{105675}Okay, then.|Cards on the table.
{105730}{105800}My boy isn´t going down alone.
{105802}{105847}Go on.
{106000}{106117}Mark Bing, Jesse Ryan,|Brad Winters and Chuck Potter.
{106149}{106243}We´re talking about the most prominent|families in this town.
{106275}{106374}Maybe they´ve all slept|with underage girls. Who can tell?
{106376}{106468}And, yes, maybe they made|a game of it.
{106470}{106533}And perhaps Eric|can even get proof of that.
{106535}{106664}l agree it would be awful,|but l don´t think it´s criminal.
{106716}{106801}Now, there will be scouts|at the game on Friday.
{106803}{106886}Eric takes a fall,|maybe they all will.
{106888}{106975}You wanna be responsible|for ruining these boys´ lives?
{107024}{107067}That sums it up.
{107069}{107168}Karen, what we have here|is an issue with intent.
{107170}{107236}- Blue-sheet it.|- Oh, but Jay--
{107238}{107365}What you don´t have is evidence enough|to tarnish this boy´s reputation.
{107367}{107500}lt´s not about evidence, is it?|lt´s about elections, right?
{107502}{107572}That is it, Robbie.|That is all.

{108864}{108970}lf he´s gonna do it, you know, be seen|talking in public with someone...

{109136}{109194}Someone cool,|someone who counts.
{109196}{109264}You know, someone.
{109266}{109403}But instead, it´s her.|l just feel totally--

{114420}{114459}There´s a shocker.
{114494}{114579}Exhibit A:|She tried to steal Brad from me.
{114581}{114642}She´s a ""Melrose Place"" superbitch.

{121007}{121089}He´s got a party Friday,|and he invited us.
{121091}{121165}- We won´t go if you don´t want to.|- No, let´s go.
{121167}{121214}Really?
{121861}{121913}What´s wrong?

{127267}{127360}Oh, Jess, where´s your sac?|Come on!
{128077}{128174}You have to tell her|who her father is.
{128176}{128276}- Why?|- Because she´ll believe it from you.
{128278}{128377}Rachel needs to seek treatment|before it´s too late.
{128409}{128467}Too late for what?
{128525}{128613}Rachel´s best friend|committed suicide...
{128657}{128715}and l´m afraid Rachel may...
{128717}{128861}harm herself or others.
{128947}{129070}And you want to take me|out there?
{129072}{129123}Yes.
{129325}{129389}He saw me!
{129391}{129474}Go get ´em, baby!
{129476}{129551}Good afternoon, and welcome|to today´s matchup...
{129553}{129650}between your Bates Bulldogs|and the Carlin Devils.
{129652}{129710}This is the first game|for both teams...
{129712}{129803}as the Bulldogs seek|their seventh consecutive championship.
{129805}{129902}However, there is a history|of bad blood between these two teams...
{129904}{130009}as the Devils have consistently|been a thorn in the Bulldogs´ side.
{130011}{130109}Well, let´s hope the Dawgs can|pull that thorn out once and for all...
{130111}{130223}as the special teams get set|for the opening kickoff.
{130225}{130319}Number 42 of the Bulldogs,|Chuck Potter, receiving the kick.
{130414}{130524}Oh, my! He´s popped.
{130565}{130609}Could l have my purse, please?
{130902}{130970}Just about five minutes to go now|in the second quarter.
{130972}{131035}Go, Jesse!
{131037}{131172}A vicious hit by Stark.|Johnson, number 45, isn´t getting up.
{131174}{131290}- What the hell kind of call was that?|- And it looks like number 33, Stark...
{131292}{131398}is being ejected|for a flagrant personal foul.
{131400}{131463}What the hell is he fuckin´ doing?
{131465}{131597}- That was not a flagrant foul!|- Thirty-three has been disqualified.
{131599}{131677}Oh, why don´t l just take|every starter out for you, all right?
{131803}{131879}Touchdown, Devils!
{131881}{132012}The Bulldogs are trailing in the second|half as they receive the Devils´ punt.
{132014}{132129}Number 42, Chuck Potter,|takes the kick again for the Dawgs.
{132131}{132202}And there he goes...
{132204}{132290}cutting across the field,|racing down the sideline!
{132514}{132583}Fourth quarter action.|Here´s the snap.
{132585}{132699}A quick pass to Jesse Ryan,|and, oooh, he was hit hard.
{132701}{132807}What a pop.|He is down.
{132809}{132898}He is not getting up|right away.
{133041}{133139}Wait a minute. l see--|l see movement.
{133141}{133247}Yes, he´s finally moving now.|He´s up.
{133249}{133324}Shaking it off.|And there he goes.
{133379}{133504}Everything´s so different,|so very different.
{133506}{133580}Things change.
{133582}{133653}There´s Mr. Bellows.|Hello, George!
{133701}{133761}He always had an eye for me,|that one.
{133763}{133849}- Where?|- Right there.
{133877}{133920}Hello, George.
{134005}{134065}Devils suck!
{134067}{134139}Well, it´s pretty much|do or die time now, folks.
{134141}{134237}The Dawgs down by four|with only 12 seconds left on the clock.
{134239}{134304}Boy, it´s been a struggle all day|for these Dawgs...
{134306}{134396}trying to move the ball|against the very stingy Devils defense.
{134398}{134490}l think it´s safe to say this is not how|the Dawgs wanted it to come out today.
{134492}{134542}They´ve had a very tough time|on defense.
{134544}{134643}- They´re not moving the ball as usual.|- Ryan, get up here. Come on.
{134645}{134759}All right, son, trips right,|crazy eight. Let´s go.
{134761}{134874}They´re really taking their time here.|Probably their last play of the game.
{134908}{134977}Trips right, crazy eight.
{135040}{135090}Go, Bulldogs!
{135188}{135246}Hey, come back here!
{135356}{135487}Last chance. We´ll look for a Hail Mary.|We´ve got Jesse Ryan set wide.
{135489}{135553}Bulldogs set.|There´s the snap.
{135555}{135637}Miller drops back.|A long bomb down towards the corner.
{135639}{135747}Ryan is there. He´s under it.|He jumps. He´s got it!
{135749}{135845}Complete!|Touchdown, Bulldogs!
{135847}{135922}Touchdown!|The Bulldogs win it!
{137214}{137275}College scout´s here.|He wants to talk to you.
{137385}{137470}Could you tell Rachel to wait for me?|l´m gonna be a few minutes.
{137472}{137577}No problem.|And, hey, good luck.
{137579}{137622}Thanks.
{137948}{138021}Jesse´s gonna be a while.|He´s talking with a scout.
{138023}{138099}- He said to go ahead to the party.|- You hear that, Rachel?
{138101}{138165}Jesse´s talking to a scout.|lsn´t that great?

{140158}{140210}They even slashed my tires.
{140212}{140325}lt´s further proof the Devils|are just a bunch of pigs, huh?
{140327}{140405}- Are you looking for Rachel?|- Yeah.
{140407}{140478}Well, she´s at Mark´s.|You want a ride over there?

{142375}{142430}Yes!
{142595}{142653}Rachel, yo.
{142655}{142721}You could get me|into this party, right?
{142723}{142794}Hey, Arnie, wait right here.|We´ll come back for you.
{142796}{142893}- See, l told you.|- ln a couple of years.

{143225}{143296}Come on. Hit it!
{143352}{143414}So, then the scout said,|and l quote...

{143526}{143584}That´s great, buddy.|For you, that is great.

{149321}{149386}No, l´m talking|about the other game.
{149388}{149455}What other game?
{149457}{149569}- The game that you´re in. My turn.|- Yeah?
{149571}{149680}- The game that you played, Rachel.|- That´s right. What was the score?
{149682}{149754}Chuckie, grab that score book.|l wanna see it.
{149756}{149858}- Want to see it now? All right.|- Come here, baby.
{149860}{149945}l wanna show you how you helped|Jesse win the game.
{149993}{150058}Two-twenty-four!|Hut, hut, hut, hut!
{150333}{150391}Rachel, catch!
{150465}{150548}Yeah, baby! Yeah!
{150569}{150640}Hold it!|l gotta get my camera for this.
{150642}{150709}- Read off the scores.|- Whoa. Hold on.
{150747}{150839}Come on, Rachel. Give it to us.|Read the scores!
{150841}{150909}Come on. Please.|Let´s start with Eric´s scores...
{150911}{150986}´cause it´s gonna be so sad.
{150988}{151050}Start with poor Eric.
{151139}{151230}What´s the matter, Rach? ls there|someone there that you recognize?
{151232}{151304}Someone you know? Huh?
{151572}{151667}Lisa. Forgot about Lisa.
{151748}{151791}Come on down!
{151793}{151874}That´s our brother!|The D.A. kissed his butt!
{152016}{152079}- We were just talking about Lisa.|- Oh, Lisa.
{152113}{152155}How was she?
{152157}{152241}Well, to be honest,|l just about split her in two.
{152492}{152572}- How many points was she?|- She was worth four points.
{152574}{152646}But l think we should deduct those|since she offed herself.
{152648}{152771}Wait. Think of how many points he´d have|got if he´d done her after she was dead.
{152802}{152865}- A bit cold, huh?|- Chuck, come on!
{152867}{152979}Rach, baby, read that.|Open it up to Jesse´s page.
{152981}{153066}l want you to see|how many points...
{153068}{153138}Jesse got for you.
{153140}{153229}Oh, well, l think that´ll be|about a two-four-six-eight!
{153231}{153293}Who do we appreciate?
{153295}{153383}More than that, ´cause remember,|Rach, you said you were a dyke...
{153385}{153445}so he got extra points|for the conversion.
{153447}{153542}Oh, the conversion!|Two points!
