1
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,236
Please, let me out of here.

2
00:01:46,624 --> 00:01:48,663
Let me out of here!

3
00:01:50,271 --> 00:01:53,751
Let me out of here!
Let me out of here, God damn it!

4
00:01:53,823 --> 00:01:56,638
Let me out of here! I don't want to die!

5
00:01:56,703 --> 00:01:59,037
Let me out of here, God damn it!

6
00:01:59,102 --> 00:02:01,338
Give me the key! I don't want to die!

7
00:02:01,406 --> 00:02:02,715
Let me out!

8
00:02:03,102 --> 00:02:05,403
Give me that key, you bitch!

9
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:09,116
Miriam! Miriam!
Give me the key! God damn it!

10
00:02:10,556 --> 00:02:11,833
Miriam!

11
00:02:16,765 --> 00:02:19,448
Genie knows you're hiding.

12
00:02:23,803 --> 00:02:25,264
Miriam?

13
00:02:29,562 --> 00:02:30,871
Miriam?

14
00:02:31,963 --> 00:02:33,523
Come out.

15
00:02:34,586 --> 00:02:37,684
Come out, wherever you are.

16
00:02:46,873 --> 00:02:49,655
Genie's out of the bottle.

17
00:02:49,976 --> 00:02:51,437
Miriam?

18
00:02:58,103 --> 00:02:59,347
Miriam.

19
00:03:00,983 --> 00:03:02,193
Come out.

20
00:03:03,062 --> 00:03:05,964
Come out, wherever you are.

21
00:03:14,837 --> 00:03:17,684
Miriam. Miriam!

22
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,380
Anybody hurt?

23
00:04:27,532 --> 00:04:29,572
Jesus fucking Christ.

24
00:04:30,188 --> 00:04:33,123
I don't believe it. We could have been killed.

25
00:04:34,635 --> 00:04:36,228
You okay, Jay-Jay?

26
00:04:38,955 --> 00:04:41,060
This is so screwed up.

27
00:04:41,131 --> 00:04:44,065
- Can't we pull it out?
- It's a hunk of steel, Holly.

28
00:04:44,138 --> 00:04:46,985
- Oh, I'm cold.
- It's going to get a lot colder.

29
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,366
- There's no signal up here.
- Great. That's just great.

30
00:04:50,442 --> 00:04:53,703
We can't haul it out.
Can't even sit in the damn thing.

31
00:04:54,505 --> 00:04:56,261
- So...
- So, what?

32
00:04:57,001 --> 00:04:58,757
- We walk.
- Walk?

33
00:04:59,464 --> 00:05:02,279
Walk where?
You don't even know where we are.

34
00:05:05,576 --> 00:05:09,372
If we follow the road down,
we can get to the highway before dark.

35
00:05:09,447 --> 00:05:12,545
Get the chance of a lift
and maybe a cell signal.

36
00:05:12,615 --> 00:05:15,200
We do not want to be out here at night.

37
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:19,683
You do what you want.
I'm staying with the truck.

38
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,797
Okay.

39
00:05:24,965 --> 00:05:26,623
Take it easy, Karen.

40
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,812
I'm not tramping through the woods
in these boots.

41
00:05:34,884 --> 00:05:37,535
- Baby, come on.
- They were $500, okay?

42
00:05:41,347 --> 00:05:42,492
Shit.

43
00:06:02,049 --> 00:06:04,285
You realize this is the last time
we're going to be doing this?

44
00:06:04,353 --> 00:06:06,240
What? Dying of exposure?

45
00:06:07,648 --> 00:06:09,371
You know what I mean.

46
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,477
We've been camping here
since we were kids.

47
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:16,123
<i>Hey, I got it. Lord of the Rings.</i>

48
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:17,717
It's a gay allegory.

49
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:20,125
<i>Bug, is this more
of your Lord of the Rings bullshit?</i>

50
00:06:20,191 --> 00:06:23,932
In which the addictive pleasures
of the one ring must be destroyed

51
00:06:23,998 --> 00:06:28,667
in the fiery and, I think it's safe to say,
vaginal crack of doom.

52
00:06:28,734 --> 00:06:30,424
It's still bullshit.

53
00:06:33,725 --> 00:06:35,099
Where are we?

54
00:06:36,253 --> 00:06:40,442
Wherever we are, we're not going
to make it to the highway before dark.

55
00:06:41,212 --> 00:06:45,270
Look how the road loops.
If we cut through the forest, we save miles.

56
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,179
Jesus, how much further?

57
00:06:54,586 --> 00:06:58,164
- Shouldn't we have hit that road by now?
- How should I know?

58
00:07:00,793 --> 00:07:03,793
Oh, great.
Now we're going to be swimming home.

59
00:07:05,273 --> 00:07:07,183
We gotta just keep going.

60
00:07:20,632 --> 00:07:22,671
Jesus, it's creepy out here.

61
00:07:27,095 --> 00:07:29,004
It's getting really cold.

62
00:07:34,805 --> 00:07:37,260
- I can't go on.
- Me neither.

63
00:07:42,932 --> 00:07:43,980
What the hell is that?

64
00:07:44,052 --> 00:07:47,347
You must have just set off
some kind of motion detector.

65
00:07:50,484 --> 00:07:53,647
- It's not on the map.
- How can it not be on the map?

66
00:07:58,898 --> 00:08:00,109
Hello?

67
00:08:04,562 --> 00:08:05,838
Hello?

68
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:09,168
Careful. It could be electrified.

69
00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:14,671
I guess not.

70
00:08:24,975 --> 00:08:28,139
Did it occur to you
there might be a gate somewhere?

71
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,558
It's breaking and entering.

72
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,206
It's okay. It'll just be for the night.

73
00:08:56,492 --> 00:08:57,953
Looks deserted.

74
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:02,760
- What the hell is this place?
- There's got to be a phone here.

75
00:09:03,883 --> 00:09:06,403
Hello? Hello?

76
00:09:07,883 --> 00:09:10,370
Looks like it's completely sealed up.

77
00:09:12,266 --> 00:09:13,411
Hello?

78
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:20,672
Hello?

79
00:09:20,745 --> 00:09:23,265
Don't do that. It gives me the creeps.

80
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,265
Hello?

81
00:09:46,597 --> 00:09:50,142
Looks like a ventilation duct.
With a big skylight.

82
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:26,331
- We're in. Come on, guys.
- In? I don't wanna.

83
00:10:26,849 --> 00:10:28,093
Jay, come on, this is crazy.

84
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:31,008
Look, if we stay out here
we're going to freeze.

85
00:10:31,328 --> 00:10:33,913
Okay, let me think about that a second.

86
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,750
It's got to be 30 feet down.

87
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:58,680
What's up, little sister? You scared?

88
00:10:59,548 --> 00:11:01,458
That's big sister to you.

89
00:11:01,917 --> 00:11:04,306
- Don't fall.
- Thanks for the advice.

90
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:21,458
- What's happening down there?
- She's almost down.

91
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,214
I'm down.

92
00:11:47,479 --> 00:11:50,196
I'm going to try to get to the front door.

93
00:13:20,844 --> 00:13:22,535
Did you hear something?

94
00:13:26,827 --> 00:13:27,841
Jay?

95
00:13:32,906 --> 00:13:33,986
Jay, are you okay?

96
00:13:42,025 --> 00:13:43,105
Here.

97
00:13:43,561 --> 00:13:46,430
- Give me a hand. I'm going down there.
- Right.

98
00:14:10,982 --> 00:14:12,323
Oh, my God!

99
00:14:28,996 --> 00:14:30,010
Jay?

100
00:14:37,635 --> 00:14:38,879
Jay!

101
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:51,706
Jay!

102
00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:05,563
Jay!

103
00:15:27,229 --> 00:15:28,210
Jesus!

104
00:15:28,284 --> 00:15:30,772
Christ. You scared the shit out of me!

105
00:15:31,356 --> 00:15:33,461
Come on, you got to see this.

106
00:15:55,737 --> 00:15:56,915
Jesus.

107
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,986
- They're going to say that we did this.
- Josh, it's going to be okay.

108
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,579
Come on, let's get out of here.

109
00:16:25,046 --> 00:16:27,763
All right. They got the lights on.

110
00:16:29,142 --> 00:16:30,603
Come on, Karen.

111
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,402
Okay, Karen?

112
00:16:37,716 --> 00:16:39,090
You go first.

113
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,917
Oh, shit.

114
00:17:09,776 --> 00:17:10,921
Look out!

115
00:17:13,584 --> 00:17:15,372
- Dude?
- Are you okay?

116
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,000
Yeah, I'll live.

117
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:22,566
Shit.

118
00:17:23,054 --> 00:17:24,483
Okay, Karen.

119
00:17:25,134 --> 00:17:26,312
Karen?

120
00:17:27,022 --> 00:17:28,167
Karen?

121
00:17:31,982 --> 00:17:33,127
Karen?

122
00:17:34,158 --> 00:17:35,335
Karen?

123
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,667
- Karen?
- Where's she at?

124
00:17:46,091 --> 00:17:49,407
She's gone. I can't believe she's gone.

125
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:53,640
- Where's Karen?
- Bad news.

126
00:17:54,251 --> 00:17:55,974
What happened to you?

127
00:17:56,746 --> 00:17:59,560
- We have to leave this place right now.
- Why?

128
00:18:01,994 --> 00:18:03,685
Don't go down there.

129
00:18:07,081 --> 00:18:09,252
Holy shit! Who the hell did this?

130
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,303
Oh, great.

131
00:18:10,377 --> 00:18:12,384
We're trapped in a blood bath
in the middle of the mountains.

132
00:18:12,456 --> 00:18:13,700
No, guys.

133
00:18:14,024 --> 00:18:17,536
I think they did it to each other.

134
00:18:17,608 --> 00:18:19,713
There'd be blood. Look at all the blood.

135
00:18:19,783 --> 00:18:22,019
Someone else did this,
they'd have tracked blood all over.

136
00:18:22,088 --> 00:18:25,470
Which means, it's not like we're dealing with
some psychopath kind of thing here, right?

137
00:18:25,543 --> 00:18:29,284
Yeah. Just a routine "people go crazy
and butcher each other" kind of thing.

138
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,139
We're out of here, now.

139
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,444
How exactly?

140
00:18:42,853 --> 00:18:43,965
Karen?

141
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,588
It's a prison. A goddamn Supermax.

142
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,088
Baby, please.

143
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,245
Karen?

144
00:18:59,107 --> 00:19:00,252
Karen!

145
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,279
Karen!

146
00:19:06,274 --> 00:19:07,648
Karen!

147
00:19:21,888 --> 00:19:23,000
Karen?

148
00:19:23,488 --> 00:19:25,397
She was out there a minute ago.

149
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,283
Karen!

150
00:19:29,184 --> 00:19:30,231
Karen!

151
00:19:30,815 --> 00:19:32,822
- Karen!
- Karen!

152
00:19:35,135 --> 00:19:36,280
Karen?

153
00:19:40,862 --> 00:19:43,513
- Where's Jay?
- I thought she was with you.

154
00:19:44,765 --> 00:19:45,780
Jay.

155
00:19:46,397 --> 00:19:49,397
- Jay?
- Jay, where are you?

156
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:18,934
Jay!

157
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,077
Jay?

158
00:20:22,105 --> 00:20:23,381
Over here.

159
00:20:34,423 --> 00:20:36,048
What the hell?

160
00:21:05,876 --> 00:21:07,185
What is it?

161
00:21:08,275 --> 00:21:10,446
- Jay?
- I don't know.

162
00:21:11,731 --> 00:21:13,160
Oh, shit.

163
00:21:14,355 --> 00:21:16,209
Is that a guy in there?

164
00:21:20,306 --> 00:21:22,313
They've got a guy in there.

165
00:21:38,576 --> 00:21:42,951
- What's that in his stomach?
- It's to feed him. To keep him alive.

166
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:45,870
Looks like some sort of experiment.

167
00:21:50,286 --> 00:21:53,068
You can't experiment on a person like this.

168
00:21:55,469 --> 00:21:56,931
- Shit.
- What?

169
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:59,399
I know where it is.

170
00:21:59,469 --> 00:22:02,087
- What, Josh?
- The key to the front door.

171
00:22:19,435 --> 00:22:22,152
Josh, messing with the bodies
is a really bad idea.

172
00:22:22,219 --> 00:22:23,909
You got a better one?

173
00:22:27,626 --> 00:22:29,414
- How do you know it's the key?
- I don't.

174
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:32,743
I'm not going to move her.
I just want to take a look.

175
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,247
- Shit.
- What?

176
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,328
It's not the key. It's something else.

177
00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:46,748
Okay, look. We find a ladder.
A bookcase. Something.

178
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:49,606
We pile it under the skylight and we climb.

179
00:22:53,575 --> 00:22:55,647
- Looks like she...
- Don't, Josh!

180
00:22:55,719 --> 00:22:57,125
- It's stuck.
- Oh, God.

181
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,361
- The hell with this.
- Josh, no!

182
00:23:00,006 --> 00:23:03,650
Holy shit! It was stuck in her throat.

183
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:07,361
- What, what, what, she swallowed it?
- She tried to.

184
00:23:07,781 --> 00:23:09,919
But why would she do that?

185
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:13,403
Guess she didn't want anybody leaving.

186
00:23:21,124 --> 00:23:23,807
- It's the wrong key.
- You don't know that.

187
00:23:32,226 --> 00:23:33,436
Damn it!

188
00:23:39,105 --> 00:23:40,828
- Oh, Jesus.
- Whoa.

189
00:23:51,807 --> 00:23:54,622
It was probably just a short.
Water getting in somewhere.

190
00:23:54,687 --> 00:23:56,247
Or the grid going down.

191
00:23:59,711 --> 00:24:03,093
Fuses. There's got to be fuses
in the basement.

192
00:24:04,542 --> 00:24:05,589
Guys.

193
00:24:06,718 --> 00:24:09,499
When I first got here I turned on the lights.

194
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:13,589
So who just turned them off?

195
00:24:14,141 --> 00:24:17,108
Oh, great.
Let's just scare ourselves to death.

196
00:24:24,636 --> 00:24:25,716
Shit.

197
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,722
- Jay, come back!
- Jay!

198
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,630
It's okay.
It must be some kind of auxiliary power.

199
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,473
- What are you doing?
- Opening the door.

200
00:25:00,471 --> 00:25:04,661
- He's a human being, Holly.
- Jay, I have a really bad feeling about this.

201
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:25,709
Look at this guy.

202
00:25:26,452 --> 00:25:28,873
Looks like a goddamn electric chair.

203
00:25:29,971 --> 00:25:32,076
They're monitoring his brain.

204
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:34,858
His brain works?

205
00:25:37,138 --> 00:25:40,335
He's not dead. He's in some sort of coma.

206
00:25:42,739 --> 00:25:45,007
How do you know he's not just asleep?

207
00:25:45,074 --> 00:25:48,270
People who are asleep... wake up.

208
00:25:56,944 --> 00:25:58,154
- Shit!
- Oh, my God!

209
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:01,486
- What the hell was that?
- Electroconvulsive therapy.

210
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:02,854
What?

211
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:03,910
Why?

212
00:26:04,975 --> 00:26:06,982
What's that on his forehead?

213
00:26:12,751 --> 00:26:15,206
- An eye.
- A tattoo.

214
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,335
Shit.

215
00:26:25,997 --> 00:26:28,233
- It's that guy.
- What guy?

216
00:26:28,301 --> 00:26:30,537
The guy that bit his tongue off.

217
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:32,549
When he was a kid.

218
00:26:32,844 --> 00:26:35,626
Then he killed his family.
It was like ten years ago.

219
00:26:35,691 --> 00:26:37,480
Okay, we're leaving now.

220
00:26:39,147 --> 00:26:40,773
But they killed him.

221
00:26:40,843 --> 00:26:43,330
I mean, they killed him.
I'm sure they killed him.

222
00:26:43,403 --> 00:26:46,185
- They executed him.
- So it's not the guy.

223
00:26:48,938 --> 00:26:50,399
You okay, Jay?

224
00:26:55,338 --> 00:26:57,825
Jay, it's not the guy. How can it be?

225
00:26:59,432 --> 00:27:02,694
When I first came in I saw something.

226
00:27:03,369 --> 00:27:06,085
- What?
- It was near the bodies.

227
00:27:07,304 --> 00:27:09,759
It was severed, bitten off.

228
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:11,940
A tongue.

229
00:27:12,712 --> 00:27:14,566
Why didn't you tell us?

230
00:27:14,631 --> 00:27:17,697
Okay, enough.
Let's just get the hell out of here.

231
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:29,726
What the hell is going on here?

232
00:27:29,797 --> 00:27:32,546
This is money, guys. Millions of dollars.

233
00:27:33,061 --> 00:27:35,450
- Lock it.
- He's not going to hurt you, Holly.

234
00:27:35,524 --> 00:27:37,728
I want to see you turn the key.

235
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:43,362
- Okay. We prioritize. First...
- We get the hell out of here.

236
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:47,257
Second, we get the hell away from here.
Third, we forget we ever came here.

237
00:27:47,331 --> 00:27:50,429
We find the generator.
There must be a lower level.

238
00:27:50,755 --> 00:27:52,959
We climb. Through the air vents.

239
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:54,977
We saw the duct on the roof.

240
00:27:55,042 --> 00:27:58,457
- There's a grill on it.
- We can get it off. At least try.

241
00:27:58,530 --> 00:27:59,904
Our flashlights are dying.

242
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:02,652
In about an hour, maybe less,
they're going to be dead.

243
00:28:02,721 --> 00:28:04,128
We're going to be stuck here in the dark.

244
00:28:04,193 --> 00:28:06,811
How do you know it's a generator?
What if it is the grid?

245
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,287
They're not hooked up to the grid.

246
00:28:08,352 --> 00:28:11,418
All the juice they'd be sucking down,
they'd have the FBI out here in a week.

247
00:28:11,488 --> 00:28:12,830
He's right.

248
00:28:12,896 --> 00:28:15,678
Out here in the sticks, the Feds
are tipped off to high consumption.

249
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:18,777
Guys cooking meth,
guys growing marijuana with UV.

250
00:28:18,848 --> 00:28:20,735
They all use generators.

251
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:23,802
What they were doing here
was underground.

252
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:29,277
There's gonna be a generator to run all this.
A big one.

253
00:29:01,978 --> 00:29:03,865
Maybe there's a way out.

254
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:13,296
Okay.

255
00:29:20,728 --> 00:29:22,867
Josh, are you sure about this?

256
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:25,326
Josh?

257
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:28,595
You ready?

258
00:30:01,203 --> 00:30:04,105
- What's that smell?
- Smells like shit.

259
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:12,780
- That's weird.
- What?

260
00:30:13,266 --> 00:30:15,786
Gauge says the tank's still half full.

261
00:30:22,704 --> 00:30:24,592
Probably just the gauge.

262
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,690
Something's in here.

263
00:30:39,183 --> 00:30:41,517
Got to be a switch here somewhere.

264
00:30:43,085 --> 00:30:46,434
Something just came in.

265
00:30:53,037 --> 00:30:54,117
Josh?

266
00:31:02,251 --> 00:31:03,299
Josh?

267
00:31:06,347 --> 00:31:08,321
- Someone...
- Someone, what?

268
00:31:12,554 --> 00:31:14,441
Someone switched it off.

269
00:31:49,766 --> 00:31:51,905
Holly, open the door!

270
00:31:51,974 --> 00:31:53,348
Josh, you're hit!

271
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:54,842
Oh, my God!

272
00:31:54,918 --> 00:31:56,706
Open the goddamn door!

273
00:31:57,317 --> 00:32:00,066
- Be careful!
- Get me out of here!

274
00:32:00,132 --> 00:32:02,303
- It's gonna be okay, Josh.
- Help!

275
00:32:02,788 --> 00:32:04,959
- Be careful!
- You can't leave me in here!

276
00:32:05,028 --> 00:32:07,417
- Josh!
- Oh, please hang on.

277
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:09,248
I can't stop the bleeding.
The wound's too deep.

278
00:32:09,316 --> 00:32:10,625
Get me out of here.

279
00:32:10,691 --> 00:32:11,673
Help!

280
00:32:11,748 --> 00:32:12,827
No.

281
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:15,233
Get me out of here!

282
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:18,623
- Come on, Josh.
- Josh.

283
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,874
There's no pulse.

284
00:32:25,057 --> 00:32:27,228
Oh, my God, my brother.

285
00:32:39,456 --> 00:32:41,343
Get me out of here!

286
00:32:42,048 --> 00:32:43,836
You fucking maniac!

287
00:32:46,495 --> 00:32:50,521
- I'm going to kill you! Fuck you!
- No!

288
00:32:51,774 --> 00:32:53,203
No!

289
00:32:54,846 --> 00:32:56,471
No!

290
00:33:01,277 --> 00:33:03,000
Why?

291
00:33:08,412 --> 00:33:10,932
My brother.

292
00:33:29,178 --> 00:33:30,519
My brother.

293
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:35,991
Be careful.

294
00:34:21,076 --> 00:34:22,570
- What was that?
- Nothing.

295
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,815
It's nothing. He can't get out.

296
00:34:34,258 --> 00:34:35,436
Please.

297
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:37,547
Please!

298
00:34:42,673 --> 00:34:43,982
Thanks.

299
00:34:50,096 --> 00:34:53,957
We get out through the air vents.
That duct on the roof.

300
00:34:56,111 --> 00:34:57,485
Better get Jay.

301
00:35:16,812 --> 00:35:17,925
Jay.

302
00:35:19,053 --> 00:35:21,354
- We're getting out of here.
- We're going to get the police

303
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:24,387
and we're going to tell them
what happened here.

304
00:35:30,603 --> 00:35:31,748
Jay.

305
00:35:32,907 --> 00:35:34,434
I'm okay.

306
00:35:38,058 --> 00:35:40,098
How do they kill them, Bug?

307
00:35:41,738 --> 00:35:42,982
Who?

308
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:46,406
Murderers.

309
00:35:48,041 --> 00:35:50,375
Trust me, Jay, this guy is going
to get what's coming to him.

310
00:35:50,441 --> 00:35:52,579
In California, lethal injection.

311
00:35:52,648 --> 00:35:55,779
Anesthetic. First, the anesthetic.

312
00:35:55,848 --> 00:35:57,736
Then the muscle relaxant
which stops the guy breathing.

313
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,188
Then the drug that stops the heart
and then the doctor pronounces...

314
00:36:00,263 --> 00:36:02,718
But what if the doctor's been bought?

315
00:36:03,655 --> 00:36:07,233
What if the murderer's heart's still beating
but the doctor said it stopped.

316
00:36:07,303 --> 00:36:09,986
You're talking about the guy in the tank?

317
00:36:10,214 --> 00:36:13,759
They wheel him away,
and now they have a body to play with.

318
00:36:17,318 --> 00:36:20,830
Well, why not just grab a homeless person
or do a deal with an asylum?

319
00:36:20,901 --> 00:36:24,316
And there's the family.
Don't they want to bury their kin?

320
00:36:25,541 --> 00:36:27,133
He killed his kin.

321
00:36:34,148 --> 00:36:35,555
It's coming loose.

322
00:36:37,347 --> 00:36:39,518
It's four hours till sun up, dude.

323
00:36:39,587 --> 00:36:43,896
Sun or no sun,
we're still going to be in the dark.

324
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,068
You know, we should go.

325
00:37:04,448 --> 00:37:06,652
Bug and Peter are waiting for us.

326
00:37:08,959 --> 00:37:10,235
I'm staying.

327
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:15,220
I want to know why my brother died.

328
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:29,340
<i>Confronted with the possibility that
this is not, strictly speaking, a dream state,</i>

329
00:37:29,405 --> 00:37:31,925
<i>lucid or otherwise, we are...
We are faced with...</i>

330
00:37:31,996 --> 00:37:34,483
<i>Miriam! Miriam!</i>

331
00:37:37,948 --> 00:37:41,744
<i>...occur when calcium is admitted
through voltage-sensitive membrane...</i>

332
00:37:43,707 --> 00:37:46,489
<i>...recourse to a nerve agent
as a means of inducing coma</i>

333
00:37:46,554 --> 00:37:49,369
<i>was taken only after a considerable debate.</i>

334
00:37:52,154 --> 00:37:53,746
You got it, dude?

335
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:59,791
I can feel the air moving.

336
00:38:02,872 --> 00:38:06,418
<i>...decision to use electroconvulsive therapy
was taken without,</i>

337
00:38:06,488 --> 00:38:08,855
<i>in my opinion, without proper consultation.</i>

338
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,571
<i>It is since the adoption of electroshock,</i>

339
00:38:11,896 --> 00:38:15,572
<i>as a means of punishment
that the phenomenon,</i>

340
00:38:15,831 --> 00:38:19,857
<i>I can't think of a better word,
have become so difficult to contain.</i>

341
00:38:19,959 --> 00:38:21,333
<i>Dr. Gregg...</i>

342
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:25,781
<i>...then tried to break
into the observation room.</i>

343
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:29,555
<i>We took the decision to wake him up,
but we couldn't.</i>

344
00:38:30,005 --> 00:38:33,616
<i>It was impossible,
as though he were in some sort of a trance.</i>

345
00:38:38,005 --> 00:38:40,557
There's a junction
with a duct going straight up.

346
00:38:40,628 --> 00:38:43,311
- You reckon we could climb it?
- I think so.

347
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,510
I'll go get Jay.

348
00:40:10,505 --> 00:40:11,520
Jay?

349
00:40:29,383 --> 00:40:30,495
Jay?

350
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,255
Jay, you in there?

351
00:40:45,605 --> 00:40:47,971
Jay, sweetheart.

352
00:40:59,076 --> 00:41:01,497
Do you believe we have a soul, Holly?

353
00:41:02,531 --> 00:41:04,920
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

354
00:41:07,555 --> 00:41:09,693
When we were kids, me and Josh,

355
00:41:09,762 --> 00:41:13,755
we used to put these playing cards
on top of the bookcase in my room,

356
00:41:13,826 --> 00:41:18,016
so that if I was really floating around,
I could see what was up there.

357
00:41:18,337 --> 00:41:19,897
Floating around?

358
00:41:21,025 --> 00:41:23,610
There was this period
where I used to have these dreams

359
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:26,747
and I would sort of just float up
out of my body.

360
00:41:27,264 --> 00:41:30,166
- Were you scared?
- No.

361
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:35,069
It was beautiful. I felt so free.

362
00:41:36,991 --> 00:41:42,108
There are people that would do anything
just for the chance

363
00:41:42,174 --> 00:41:45,490
to float up out of their lives,
even for just a second.

364
00:41:45,854 --> 00:41:48,472
Some people, they try so hard and it's like,

365
00:41:48,541 --> 00:41:51,508
no matter what they do
they never get a chance.

366
00:41:57,692 --> 00:41:58,870
Josh.

367
00:42:01,308 --> 00:42:04,155
He was always in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

368
00:42:06,811 --> 00:42:11,993
He wasn't bad. He was making it work.
He was pulling it together.

369
00:42:13,914 --> 00:42:15,059
He...

370
00:42:15,962 --> 00:42:17,523
He really was.

371
00:42:52,694 --> 00:42:56,141
Orin Kiefer. He was in a cell for 15 years.

372
00:42:57,621 --> 00:42:59,050
Before that he was in asylum.

373
00:42:59,701 --> 00:43:01,523
Before that he was in hell.

374
00:43:02,581 --> 00:43:05,897
Mother. His mother,
she used to scour his mouth.

375
00:43:05,972 --> 00:43:07,052
I don't want to hear it.

376
00:43:07,124 --> 00:43:09,579
- To stop him from singing, she...
- I don't want to hear it!

377
00:44:56,230 --> 00:45:00,191
Can you imagine being seven years old
and wanting to do that, and then doing it?

378
00:45:00,262 --> 00:45:01,210
Jay.

379
00:45:01,286 --> 00:45:04,547
At San Quentin they had him
in a 10 by 12 cement cell,

380
00:45:04,613 --> 00:45:07,646
with no windows,
locked down 23 hours a day.

381
00:45:07,717 --> 00:45:11,033
- Look, we're getting out of here.
- Don't you see what I'm saying?

382
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:14,720
Can you imagine how attractive
the thought of floating away would be

383
00:45:14,789 --> 00:45:17,276
to someone forced to live like that?

384
00:45:18,468 --> 00:45:20,061
We're out of here.

385
00:46:27,419 --> 00:46:28,728
They've been studying him for years,

386
00:46:28,795 --> 00:46:32,024
starting with the Stanford Research Institute
remote viewing program.

387
00:46:32,091 --> 00:46:33,978
Remote viewing. What's that?

388
00:46:34,043 --> 00:46:37,817
The National Security Council,
the Defense Intelligence Agency, the CIA.

389
00:46:37,882 --> 00:46:40,915
They all kicked in funds.
Project codename: Sun Streak.

390
00:46:40,986 --> 00:46:42,513
What's remote viewing?

391
00:46:43,546 --> 00:46:46,229
It's where you see things
when you are not really there.

392
00:46:46,298 --> 00:46:49,047
- Oh, like a form of clairvoyance.
- A form of bullshit.

393
00:46:49,113 --> 00:46:52,626
Yeah, it's bullshit, but the CIA spent
over $70 million doing research.

394
00:46:52,697 --> 00:46:55,479
- They officially shut it down in '95.
- Why?

395
00:46:55,545 --> 00:46:58,741
Leaks, embarrassing revelations.
It's all in here.

396
00:46:59,287 --> 00:47:03,411
They brought Kiefer into the program in '99.
They thought he was a freak of nature.

397
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,203
They could do
whatever they wanted with him.

398
00:47:05,271 --> 00:47:08,980
They were drugging him, making incisions,
rewiring his brain.

399
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:10,988
They put him in a coma.

400
00:47:11,062 --> 00:47:13,363
They used electroshock therapy
to control him.

401
00:47:13,431 --> 00:47:16,212
Control him? The guy's strapped in a chair.

402
00:47:20,086 --> 00:47:21,230
Peter.

403
00:47:41,395 --> 00:47:42,736
Peter?

404
00:47:44,435 --> 00:47:45,995
Peter, are you okay?

405
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,140
Peter?

406
00:47:49,809 --> 00:47:51,303
Talk to us, dude!

407
00:48:19,151 --> 00:48:21,419
He wouldn't have left without us.

408
00:49:08,936 --> 00:49:11,838
Oh, shit. The cellar door's open.

409
00:49:22,118 --> 00:49:25,020
Bug, don't. Maybe it wasn't Peter.

410
00:49:25,926 --> 00:49:27,268
Down here.

411
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:29,695
Peter?

412
00:49:31,238 --> 00:49:33,790
- Peter, are you down there?
- It's okay.

413
00:49:36,197 --> 00:49:38,172
- Everything's okay.
- Peter?

414
00:50:04,769 --> 00:50:05,914
Peter?

415
00:50:07,329 --> 00:50:08,474
Peter?

416
00:50:16,896 --> 00:50:18,619
My flashlight's dying.

417
00:50:36,541 --> 00:50:38,068
Peter, please.

418
00:50:52,859 --> 00:50:54,648
- Shit.
- It's okay. It's okay.

419
00:51:00,539 --> 00:51:01,847
Shit.

420
00:51:17,337 --> 00:51:19,028
No! No!

421
00:51:20,121 --> 00:51:22,063
Please don't hurt me.

422
00:51:25,656 --> 00:51:28,655
Get away from me. Please!

423
00:51:29,175 --> 00:51:31,892
Please! Stay away from me.

424
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:38,480
Son of a bitch!

425
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:40,274
It's okay. It's okay.

426
00:51:43,606 --> 00:51:45,711
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

427
00:51:56,116 --> 00:51:57,392
It's okay.

428
00:52:06,098 --> 00:52:07,276
Peter?

429
00:52:11,698 --> 00:52:13,259
The psycho's dead.

430
00:52:17,137 --> 00:52:18,414
It's over.

431
00:52:19,729 --> 00:52:21,518
It's going to be okay.

432
00:52:25,168 --> 00:52:27,437
Come on. Come on. Shit, come on!

433
00:52:30,032 --> 00:52:32,203
Come on, Peter, it's okay.

434
00:52:32,943 --> 00:52:34,853
We're going to get out of here.

435
00:52:36,751 --> 00:52:39,501
Okay. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
Come on. Come on.

436
00:52:39,567 --> 00:52:41,541
Come on, let's go. Come on. Come on.

437
00:52:55,725 --> 00:52:56,968
Peter?

438
00:52:58,956 --> 00:53:00,101
Peter?

439
00:53:04,844 --> 00:53:07,713
Run! Run! Run!

440
00:53:10,731 --> 00:53:12,389
Come on, hurry up!

441
00:53:21,898 --> 00:53:23,807
Quick, get in the room!

442
00:53:59,205 --> 00:54:00,449
- Holly, open the door.
- Holly!

443
00:54:00,517 --> 00:54:02,786
- Open the door!
- Holly, please!

444
00:54:02,852 --> 00:54:04,739
- Open the door!
- Open the door!

445
00:54:07,172 --> 00:54:08,863
- Please!
- Open the door!

446
00:54:12,451 --> 00:54:13,858
Open it!

447
00:54:44,576 --> 00:54:45,852
He's gone.

448
00:54:48,127 --> 00:54:49,403
Listen.

449
00:55:02,781 --> 00:55:05,430
- No!
- Josh!

450
00:55:05,501 --> 00:55:07,672
- No, Jay. No! Let him go!
- Josh!

451
00:55:07,741 --> 00:55:10,129
- No!
- I got to get out of here!

452
00:55:16,732 --> 00:55:18,008
Oh, my God!

453
00:55:21,435 --> 00:55:22,744
Oh, my God!

454
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:32,788
Oh, my God.

455
00:55:35,001 --> 00:55:36,495
Oh, my God.

456
00:56:00,087 --> 00:56:02,028
Bug. Don't.

457
00:56:02,774 --> 00:56:05,774
When Peter fell asleep
something happened to him.

458
00:56:06,518 --> 00:56:09,747
He went nuts, is what happened.
He attacked the psycho and went crazy.

459
00:56:09,813 --> 00:56:13,741
- He dreams. People walk. Sleeping people.
- He dreams them.

460
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:16,590
- Dreams through them.
- Oh, boy.

461
00:56:16,661 --> 00:56:18,766
Come on, Jay, don't tell me
you believe that bullshit.

462
00:56:18,836 --> 00:56:20,178
I saw the files.

463
00:56:20,244 --> 00:56:22,448
Maybe there's a way
to keep a person at the brink of death,

464
00:56:22,516 --> 00:56:26,028
- suspended outside the body.
- Unable to pass over to the other side.

465
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:27,692
Unable to come back.

466
00:56:27,763 --> 00:56:28,875
My God.

467
00:56:31,282 --> 00:56:32,776
You're serious.

468
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:37,072
- Was Peter asleep when you left him?
- Maybe. I guess, but...

469
00:56:37,362 --> 00:56:38,856
Look, we watched him.

470
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:41,831
He bit his goddamn tongue off.
I mean, that's going to wake you up, right?

471
00:56:41,905 --> 00:56:44,687
- Not if you're in a coma.
- Peter's not in a coma.

472
00:56:44,753 --> 00:56:48,168
Come on, Jay, it's autosuggestion.
A response to this freak.

473
00:56:48,241 --> 00:56:51,307
I mean, we all know the story of how he lost
his goddamn tongue, and so now we're...

474
00:56:51,377 --> 00:56:54,246
I saw a tape. There was this guy.
He was a scientist.

475
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,781
He said he couldn't wake him up.

476
00:56:55,856 --> 00:56:58,823
I think he's talking
about the man in the basement.

477
00:56:58,896 --> 00:57:00,586
Maybe that's what happened to Peter.

478
00:57:00,655 --> 00:57:02,411
Oh, this is crazy.

479
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:08,772
- We find him.
- We what?

480
00:57:08,846 --> 00:57:10,668
We find Peter, and we tie him up.

481
00:57:10,733 --> 00:57:13,319
What the hell are you talking about?
Didn't you just see what I saw?

482
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:15,626
He's like a total psycho maniac.

483
00:57:17,965 --> 00:57:19,426
He's quiet now.

484
00:57:24,204 --> 00:57:26,593
When he's not dreaming, he's quiet.

485
00:57:29,131 --> 00:57:30,920
- I saw a ladder in the basement.
- No way.

486
00:57:30,988 --> 00:57:32,329
We are not opening that door!

487
00:57:32,396 --> 00:57:34,567
For all we know,
he's on the other side wide awake.

488
00:57:34,635 --> 00:57:38,977
How long can you stay awake?
An hour? A day? Two days?

489
00:57:39,051 --> 00:57:41,123
What happens when you fall asleep?

490
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:45,926
Okay. Okay.

491
00:57:45,994 --> 00:57:47,620
So, let me get this straight.

492
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:49,697
You think that if we fall asleep,
this guy's soul,

493
00:57:49,769 --> 00:57:52,933
- something gets into...
- Gets into, tunes into, I don't know.

494
00:57:53,001 --> 00:57:54,179
Incubus.

495
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:57,891
Say what?

496
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:06,502
A demon that enters into your sleep.
It's what they call it.

497
00:58:06,791 --> 00:58:07,838
Jesus.

498
00:58:10,502 --> 00:58:11,811
Demons now.

499
00:58:15,494 --> 00:58:17,796
So, if you're right,

500
00:58:17,862 --> 00:58:19,749
and I'm saying "if" to make it perfectly clear

501
00:58:19,813 --> 00:58:21,952
that I'm not buying
into this bullshit for a second.

502
00:58:22,021 --> 00:58:23,963
If you're right,
all we've got to do is open that door

503
00:58:24,038 --> 00:58:26,372
and get the hell out of the way
while this guy uses Peter to...

504
00:58:26,437 --> 00:58:27,778
Free itself.

505
00:58:27,844 --> 00:58:30,211
We can test it. An experiment.

506
00:58:30,276 --> 00:58:33,505
We tie one of us up
and whoever that is gets to...

507
00:58:33,572 --> 00:58:34,979
Fall asleep.

508
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:37,280
- This is bullshit.
- So you won't mind trying it.

509
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,169
Funny thing, I'm not that tired anymore.

510
00:58:39,236 --> 00:58:40,894
Anyway, what difference
is it going to make?

511
00:58:40,963 --> 00:58:42,817
- It's not going to help us get out of here.
- Wrong.

512
00:58:42,882 --> 00:58:46,078
If we're right, when he stops dreaming,
Peter stops walking.

513
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:47,553
For how long, Jay?

514
00:58:47,618 --> 00:58:49,920
Look, duration of cycle.

515
00:58:50,274 --> 00:58:51,932
The last one was about...

516
00:58:53,122 --> 00:58:54,528
twenty minutes.

517
00:58:54,594 --> 00:58:56,284
Enough time to get the ladder
from the basement.

518
00:58:56,353 --> 00:58:57,368
It won't work.

519
00:58:57,441 --> 00:58:58,521
If this thing is inside Peter

520
00:58:58,593 --> 00:59:00,481
how do you know
it's going to get inside one of us?

521
00:59:00,545 --> 00:59:01,886
Maybe it'll leave Peter.

522
00:59:01,952 --> 00:59:03,840
Like it left the psycho
when Peter fell asleep.

523
00:59:03,904 --> 00:59:05,333
You don't know that.

524
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,516
Bug, we don't know anything.

525
00:59:07,904 --> 00:59:10,937
Okay. Just so long as
we're not opening that door.

526
00:59:13,631 --> 00:59:15,835
So, who wants to have a nightmare?

527
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:23,383
It can't be Bug. He's too strong.
It would be too risky.

528
00:59:24,925 --> 00:59:26,518
You're the smallest.

529
00:59:27,709 --> 00:59:29,051
The weakest.

530
00:59:38,108 --> 00:59:40,147
You wake me up as soon as...

531
00:59:41,116 --> 00:59:43,799
As soon as anything happens,
you wake me up.

532
00:59:45,243 --> 00:59:46,585
I promise.

533
00:59:52,699 --> 00:59:55,284
Her teeth. We need a gag for her mouth.

534
01:00:01,817 --> 01:00:04,239
This is going to be really uncomfortable.

535
01:01:51,788 --> 01:01:54,537
Holly. Holly. Holly, wake up.

536
01:01:56,075 --> 01:01:57,766
You did good, Holly.

537
01:02:04,682 --> 01:02:06,144
Holly? Holly?

538
01:02:06,219 --> 01:02:08,455
She can't breathe! Holly?

539
01:02:08,522 --> 01:02:09,798
- Holly, just keep calm.
- She can't breathe!

540
01:02:09,865 --> 01:02:12,102
Get it off! Get it off! Get it off!

541
01:02:15,177 --> 01:02:16,584
Oh, my God!

542
01:02:28,775 --> 01:02:29,920
No!

543
01:02:30,312 --> 01:02:32,832
She's trying to kill you! Holly, stop.

544
01:02:36,998 --> 01:02:39,038
No! Bug, stop!

545
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:43,932
- You're killing Holly.
- No!

546
01:02:44,614 --> 01:02:47,909
It's not Holly! It's Kiefer!

547
01:03:44,542 --> 01:03:47,444
She was... She was going to kill you.

548
01:03:51,998 --> 01:03:53,558
We have to leave.

549
01:04:41,656 --> 01:04:43,379
It's what he wanted.

550
01:04:44,279 --> 01:04:45,588
To go over.

551
01:04:58,261 --> 01:05:01,425
Whatever it is out there, we find it

552
01:05:02,485 --> 01:05:04,754
and we rip its fucking head off.

553
01:06:23,691 --> 01:06:24,901
Come on.

554
01:07:04,166 --> 01:07:07,100
The ladder, it was right there. I know it was.

555
01:07:19,589 --> 01:07:22,752
It's Peter, Jay. What are we going to do?

556
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:26,783
Kill him.

557
01:07:56,735 --> 01:07:57,815
Bug?

558
01:07:58,848 --> 01:08:00,058
Bug?

559
01:08:00,416 --> 01:08:01,430
- It's Peter.
- Guys!

560
01:08:01,503 --> 01:08:02,713
Go!

561
01:08:26,524 --> 01:08:27,637
No!

562
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:30,616
No!

563
01:08:31,195 --> 01:08:32,275
Oh, God!

564
01:08:35,291 --> 01:08:37,429
Oh, God. Oh, God.

565
01:08:40,635 --> 01:08:41,845
Bug.

566
01:08:45,498 --> 01:08:46,774
It's me,

567
01:08:49,177 --> 01:08:50,387
Peter,

568
01:08:53,017 --> 01:08:54,260
your friend.

569
01:08:54,328 --> 01:08:57,394
Peter. Peter.

570
01:08:59,736 --> 01:09:01,743
No. Oh, God.

571
01:09:08,568 --> 01:09:10,128
Oh, Bug!

572
01:09:10,199 --> 01:09:12,948
Bug! Oh, God!

573
01:09:15,479 --> 01:09:18,413
Oh, God! Oh, God!

574
01:09:19,285 --> 01:09:21,838
- Jay-Jay.
- Oh, God.

575
01:09:22,933 --> 01:09:24,788
Jay-Jay.

576
01:09:30,612 --> 01:09:33,001
I'm coming.

577
01:09:35,028 --> 01:09:36,555
Jay-Jay.

578
01:10:28,942 --> 01:10:30,251
Jay-Jay.

579
01:10:42,955 --> 01:10:44,865
Jay-Jay.

580
01:10:45,739 --> 01:10:48,259
Coming to get you, girl.

581
01:10:53,418 --> 01:10:55,906
Dreaming about being inside you, girl.

582
01:11:02,761 --> 01:11:04,550
Don't you want to play?

583
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:34,811
<i>When I want you</i>

584
01:11:35,174 --> 01:11:38,239
<i>And all your charms</i>

585
01:11:39,141 --> 01:11:45,185
<i>All I have to do is dream</i>

586
01:11:45,893 --> 01:11:49,983
<i>Dream, dream, dream</i>

587
01:11:50,947 --> 01:11:53,630
Hey, Jay-Jay?

588
01:12:08,801 --> 01:12:10,808
Jay-Jay.

589
01:12:11,233 --> 01:12:13,535
Jay-Jay!

590
01:12:16,641 --> 01:12:19,226
Don't you be playing with me, Jaybird.

591
01:12:27,935 --> 01:12:29,974
You think you're getting out?

592
01:12:32,478 --> 01:12:34,617
You're going straight to hell.

593
01:12:59,452 --> 01:13:00,793
Jay,

594
01:13:02,843 --> 01:13:04,271
please

595
01:13:05,466 --> 01:13:07,768
don't leave me.

596
01:13:10,490 --> 01:13:12,562
Got to help me.

597
01:13:14,906 --> 01:13:16,432
Jay.

598
01:13:17,849 --> 01:13:19,856
Please.

599
01:13:34,839 --> 01:13:36,268
Please.

600
01:13:40,982 --> 01:13:42,738
Jay-Jay.

601
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:46,517
Kill me.

602
01:13:53,077 --> 01:13:54,451
Please.

603
01:17:58,455 --> 01:18:00,876
Miss, what the hell went on in here?

604
01:19:28,748 --> 01:19:29,893
Hey.

605
01:19:31,212 --> 01:19:32,772
I'm glad you're okay.

606
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,683
What's the matter, girl, cat got your tongue?
