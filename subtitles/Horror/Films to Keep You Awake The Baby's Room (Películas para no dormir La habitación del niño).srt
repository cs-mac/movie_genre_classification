1
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,846
- Yeah.
- I know you're a good person.

11
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,683
So how long are you staying in Rome?

12
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,002
I fly back to Moscow tomorrow.

13
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,727
What a coincidence! So do I.

14
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,765
- You fly to Moscow?
- Back to Spain.

15
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,891
- This is my hotel.
- Mine is down there on the left.

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,288
- So, this is closer.
- For you, yes.

17
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,085
- For you too.
- No.

18
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,366
Come on. Please, just a little
stop, to drink the last one.

19
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,761
We drank plenty in the bar.

20
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,761
Yes, but we only talked about
Russia and Spain, not about us.

21
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,127
I prefer not to talk about us.

22
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,288
It's a deal.

23
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,368
- What is?
- We don't talk.

24
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,286
We can stay without talking, you know?
And even better.

25
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,370
See, that's my room.
It's got two flags.

26
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,568
Must be a reason, no?

27
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,685
Yes, one for Europe
and one for Rome.

28
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,644
I'm talking about
what's in the middle.

29
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,684
- The middle flag is missing.
- Exactly.

30
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,441
That's because of you.
You have to come up and hang it there.

31
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,002
- And what do I hang there?
- I don't know.

32
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,091
Your clothes, for example.
You are long enough.

33
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,647
Come on.

34
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,685
I've never gone
up to a woman's room.

35
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,167
It's just a hotel room in Rome.

36
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,846
If you keep pulling, you'll win
and we'll end up in your hotel.

37
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,329
You choose.

38
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,564
- Drink?
- Wine.

39
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,569
Wine.

40
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,320
Sorry, what was your name?

41
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,246
I told you twice already.

42
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,728
Maybe at the third time I get it.

43
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,047
Natasha.

44
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,926
Natasha.
Was that the name you said before?

45
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,049
But you are not saying it right.
It's Nata-sha.

46
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,650
Sha.

47
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,810
- Sha.
- Sha.

48
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,083
And you are Alba, which
is Spanish for dawn.

49
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,966
That's my big moment. You'll see.

50
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,086
Tonight is the first
night of the summer.

51
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,648
Ah, yes, that's right, in Europe.

52
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,810
In Russia, summer has already
begun, the first of June.

53
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,163
Really? Do you have summer in Russia?

54
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,886
Of course. Well, it's Russian summer.

56
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,607
And this is my last night in Rome.

57
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,522
Mine too.

58
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,842
You're not on your own, little Russian.

59
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,885
You know for sure this is
the shortest night of the year,

60
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,925
here and in Russia, so we
have to make the most of it.

61
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,085
I'm not...

62
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,561
- I'm not a...
- What?

63
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,766
Come on, you're a woman,
and... and I'm a woman

64
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,531
and we were drinking alone at a bar

65
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,201
and we exchanged looks
and felt attracted to one another.

66
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,084
Isn't that how it works?

67
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,727
It's the first time in my life
I look like this at a woman.

69
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,600
Never before
a woman looked at me this way.

70
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,091
It's not the first time
you look at a woman like this.

71
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,602
But every woman is different.

72
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,329
Would you like to see me naked?

73
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,282
I would love to.

74
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,170
Here?

75
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,602
Wherever you like.
Do you prefer inside?

76
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,531
- Yes.
- OK, let's go inside then.

77
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,923
I think it'll work better
if you undress me.

79
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,801
It's OK.

80
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,171
It's OK.

81
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,802
It's OK.

82
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:56,210
We'll stay like this, close but
not touching, while you relax.

83
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,288
Yes?

84
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,971
It's better if you're asleep.

85
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,844
That way we
don't have to say goodbye.

86
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,886
You're right.

87
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,604
I'll say a few words.

88
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,570
Goodbye, Alba.

89
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,090
I don't want to imagine
what might have happened.

90
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,765
This secret will stay
there, sleeping with you.

91
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,524
Thank you, Alba.

92
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,366
Goodbye.

93
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,127
Who changed my ring tone?

94
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,005
What the hell happened?

95
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,171
- Who is it?
- Natasha.

96
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,325
Natasha, right.

97
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,286
I think I've left my mobile
in your room.

98
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,722
- Did you hear it ringing?
- Yes, it woke me up, actually.

99
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,649
Sorry.

100
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,411
It must have fallen out of my bag.

101
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,530
I'm very tired and I
want to go to my hotel.

102
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,406
Come in and take it.
It's waiting for you under the bed.

103
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,847
I'd rather not coma in again.

104
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,008
Why? What happened?

105
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,203
Nothing. Nothing, actually.
Nothing we have to regret.

106
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:14,247
- Why did you chew up my panties?
- I didn't chew anything.

107
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,283
See the state you left them in.

108
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,770
Good evening.

109
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,565
Good evening.

110
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,889
How thoughtful, Natasha!
I wasn't expecting this.

111
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,048
Hey, come in
and leave it in the terrace.

112
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,811
Sorry, madam. It's for this room.

113
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,084
But if you want, I can come
afterwards and take your order.

114
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,965
- Feeling hungry?
- No, no.

115
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,085
- You heard. What's your name?
- Max.

116
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,046
Max, we are not hungry right now
but in a couple of hours we will.

117
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,289
You just call me.
I'm free all night.

118
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,971
I mean I'm on duty
the whole night.

119
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,002
It's there.

120
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,607
Where is your hotel?

121
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,889
This is Tevere...

122
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,402
...and you get to my hotel

123
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,767
this way.

124
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,291
This is the Roma of the Caesars.

125
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,643
Yes. It's a map to lose yourself.

126
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,003
Where should we lose ourselves?
Choose.

127
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,327
We have... the gardens.

128
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,449
Tempio della Fortuna,
Tempio della Ninfa.

129
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,251
My hotel is called "Ninfa".

130
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,204
- And yours?
- Pompeo.

131
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,402
Look, it's this way.

132
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,642
You pass through the gardens,

133
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,003
and... and here we are,
we are on top of the theatre.

134
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:23,048
No, we are... we are inside
of Teatro di Pompeo.

136
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,289
History's looking at us

137
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,370
We are surrounded.

138
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,727
- Can you feel it?
- How could I not?

139
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,161
- I think you like history.
- Yes.

140
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,328
That's good.

141
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,884
Alba

142
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,970
This stays hers, OK?
In this room.

143
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,162
In Rome.

144
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,523
Within these four walls.

145
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,890
But since we're here,
let's have some fun, no?

146
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,082
All I ask is that
this doesn't affect my life.

147
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:33,970
- And how do you do that?
- By agreeing, the two of us.

148
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,242
You also have a life
outside of all this

149
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,170
that you want to protect, don't you?

151
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,970
Very far from yours.

152
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,371
But tomorrow Rome will send each
of us to an opposite end of Europe.

153
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,649
- What if I'm not Russian?
- Coma on, you have to be Russian.

154
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,764
I love that.

155
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,248
Well, then I am.

156
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,967
What's great is not knowing
each other's name.

157
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,162
But don't we?

158
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,930
Don't tell me you gave me
your real name.

159
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,288
So your name isn't Natasha?
I knew it.

160
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,207
Alba is the name
I was going to call my daughter.

161
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,642
What happened to her?

162
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,280
Alba never saw the dawn.

163
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,368
I'm sorry.

164
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,046
That put an end
to the worst time of my life,

165
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,289
when my Alba died inside of me.

166
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,886
My mother took me to Marbella
one summer when I was 16.

167
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,285
She was almost broke

168
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,361
and what little money she had left
she spent on fortune-hunting,

169
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,204
and she was lucky.

170
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,051
An Arab sheik, Hamir Osemin,

171
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,051
he... he bumped into us one day
when we were shopping

172
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:26,245
and we spent the rest
of the summer in his yacht.

173
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,842
That winter he invited us
to Saudi Arabia.

174
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,367
He has a palace.

175
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,241
Even if I describe it to you,
you could never imagine the luxury.

176
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,362
He bought my mother everything.

177
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,761
So she left there

178
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,807
with bracelets, necklaces and rings
worth a small fortune.

179
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,161
She left?

180
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,364
- What about you?
- I stayed.

181
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,682
Hamir persuaded my mother
to leave me there

182
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,361
in exchange for a monthly allowance
for four years.

183
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,367
That was the deal.
I was all he was interested in.

184
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,761
So you accepted?

185
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,247
You can't imagine
how easy it was for ma,

186
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,170
falling into that type of lifestyle.

187
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,044
I had everything I wanted!

188
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,563
Hamir bought me a purebred horse
that only I was allowed to ride.

189
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,648
I began to love him like a child.

190
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,010
Everyone around me was very nice.

191
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,967
Also, Hamir's other wives
treated me like a real princess.

192
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,048
And he got you pregnant?

193
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,447
That was at the and.

194
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,242
Hamir started to get annoyed with me
because I didn't get pregnant.

195
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,365
That was when I wanted to leave.
But I couldn't.

196
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,047
I'd married him so I was
his property, like my horse.

197
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,164
He sold him to punish me.

198
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:57,524
Hamir got his way, because shortly
afterwards he got me pregnant.

199
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,881
He was over the moon.

200
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,005
He began treating me royally again,
this time like a queen.

201
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,769
Then I realised that
as soon as my child was born...

202
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:15,125
Well, I'd be shut up
with the rest of his harem.

203
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,204
The day the doctor told me
I was expecting a girl,

204
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,847
an Egyptian nurse
who I'd told the story to

205
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,691
helped me escape in a Greek ship.

206
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:31,045
I arrived in Athens at dawn
so I decided to call her Alba.

207
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,970
How did you lose her?

208
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,051
I'd found out that Hamir
had gone to the authorities.

209
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:42,290
There was a warrant out for my arrest
in Saudi Arabia.

210
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,165
I knew that if I'd had Alba...

211
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,080
he couldn't have rested
until I was caught.

212
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:54,245
I was only 18
so I got an abortion.

213
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,888
I sold my necklace and managed
to start a new life in Spain.

214
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,051
What about your mother?

215
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,606
I've never seen her again.

216
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:12,647
And is that how you became a lesbian?

217
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,603
This is how I became a woman.

218
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,322
What about you?
How did you become a woman?

219
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,888
I don't feel
like talking about my life.

220
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,162
You owe me.

221
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,800
What do I owe to you?

222
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,968
The truth or a lie?

223
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,927
Whatever you prefer.
Why? Do you think I lied to you?

224
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,526
It's the Agora in Athens.

225
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,961
Did you know that?

226
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:25,209
Which came first, the picture
or your story? Who inspired who?

227
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,368
Good question.

228
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:33,528
This picture has been hanging here
since before you were born.

229
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,645
Long before, and it's been
waiting for me all this time.

230
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,211
Let's make a deal.
No stories.

231
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,210
Just tell me where you live,
your area and everything,

232
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,370
so I can get an idea
of your surroundings.

233
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,888
First go to Moscow.

234
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,527
You have the biggest map
in the world.

235
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,526
Now go to the Volga,
further east.

236
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,803
Ala! Even further east.

237
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,207
From there towards
Ostrov Nekrasov.

238
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,166
- Where?
- Ostrov Nekrasov.

239
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,090
Ostrov Nekrasov.

240
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,328
You write it, please.

241
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,451
What is that there?

242
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,887
Ostrov means island.

243
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,320
Tell me this is your house
and I'll have to spank your ass.

245
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,127
It's as hard as a rock.

246
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,565
Hey, tell me,
what are you doing here in Rome?

247
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,810
Auditioning. I'm an actress.

248
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,207
A Russian film actress.

249
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:21,043
Are you a good one, a very famous
one, or just married to a mafioso?

250
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,209
- I'm single.
- So, you must be a very good one.

251
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,800
Congratulations.

252
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,685
Show me your Arabian palace.

253
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,328
It's not mine.

254
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,367
Aren't you going to show it to mo?

255
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,889
The thing is, if Hamir finds out that
we are sniffing over his house...

256
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,764
- What?
- He's capable of...

257
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,850
Anything could happen to us.

258
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,891
Look, if you don't show it to me,

259
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,686
I'll think you are the one
who owes me a story.

260
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,643
A true one.

261
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,411
I want to know where you live.

262
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,602
Look.

263
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,203
- Do you like it?
- Is it a village?

264
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,403
No, it's a city called San Sebastian.

265
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:30,007
- Looks a bit small.
- It depends what you compare it to.

266
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,645
Rome.

267
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:37,290
I'd say about...
20 times smaller

268
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,769
Moscow is three times
the size of Rome.

269
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:49,526
Well, I like it, and you look a lot
like your city. Small, pretty face.

270
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,404
It's not my city.

271
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:55,690
I'm from Valladollid,
which is like three times bigger.

272
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,801
- Show ma your house.
- It's here.

273
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,729
- They left the chairs out..
- So?

274
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,161
I wasn't expecting this.

275
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:24,410
- What? A child?
- A boy and a girl.

276
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,289
- You have children.
- What? Can't I be a mother?

277
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,922
Of course.

278
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,764
What's up, Alba?

279
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,885
The father of your children
know you like women?

280
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,163
It's not that.
It's the picture. It's...

281
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,683
It's quite old.

282
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,043
Look at the beach.
It's full of people.

283
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,209
I'm sure we were there.

284
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,891
Or on the island.

285
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:10,009
We used to love spending Sundays
on the island.

286
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:14,523
This picture is from the summer I
started living in San Sebastian.

287
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,325
Two years ago.

288
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,287
What's wrong?

289
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,601
Alba, is there something
you need to tell me?

290
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,808
Poor thing.

291
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,770
Where did you come from?

292
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,688
How could you just show up like this,
without warning?

293
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,609
I can't believe I'm doing this.

294
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,767
What are you doing to me?

295
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,162
You're scaring me, little Russian.

296
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,325
Is this me?

297
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,528
I can't recognize myself.

298
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,682
Russian sounds so beautiful.

299
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,410
Only for you.

300
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:48,640
I'm trembling with fear too.

301
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,168
I'm going to give you
the best orgasm of your life.

302
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,169
Are you ready?

303
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,611
Yes.

304
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,762
- You know what I'd love?
- Tell me, anything you like.

305
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,606
Do you have a vibrator?

306
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,761
I'll come better
if you put something inside me.

307
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,962
I don't use vibrators.

308
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,367
And you're not going
to need one either.

309
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,171
I know myself.

310
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,210
What about a little wine bottle?

311
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,530
I don't really fancy the idea of
anything masculine coming between us.

312
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,405
It's from "La Toscana".
Sounds very feminine.

313
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,645
I'm not sticking anything
inside of you Natasha.

314
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,001
Alba, don't forget I like men.

315
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,361
But you like me as well.

316
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,888
Yes, but I like men more.

317
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,809
You know, I know plenty

318
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,447
who, once they've tried it with a
woman, never want to go back to man.

319
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,321
Well, I won't let
that happen to me.

320
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,209
In fact, I prefer the opposite.

321
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,766
So after me
you expect to like men more?

322
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,089
That would be terrific.

323
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,885
It's not very nice
telling me this now.

325
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,608
I don't want us to argue,
and even less over a bottle of wine.

326
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,931
An empty one too.

327
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,610
I'm going to order you something.

328
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,046
What are you doing?

329
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:11,245
Spaniards and Italians
we understand each other's language.

330
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,170
<i>- Good evening.</i>
- Yes, it is.

331
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,361
<i>Hungry yet?</i>

332
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,000
The lady needs a vibrator.

333
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,528
<i>I'm sorry, we don't have any.</i>

334
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:27,361
<i>But I can bring something else.
We have fruit.</i>

335
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,685
That's not good enough.

336
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,529
<i>Something else might work...</i>

337
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,405
No, forget it. Thanks, Max.

338
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,767
You are out of your mind.
You know that?

339
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,803
I did it for you.

340
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:43,164
What if Max takes it as an invitation
and comes up himself?

341
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:50,451
Well, then you'll be able to choose
between Max or a bottle of wine.

342
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:01,369
Well, Max comes from Maximus

343
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,524
It is also the diminutive of Maximus.

344
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,369
Maximo.

345
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,285
Max.

346
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,969
We're fine, Max..
We don't need anything.

347
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,003
I brought a hot cucumber.

348
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,281
What?

349
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,051
I boiled it for two minutes.

350
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,401
It's sterile.

351
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,803
My friend would rather use
the wine bottle.

352
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,045
It's Tuscan.

353
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,525
What about you?

354
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,525
Me?

355
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,881
I'm a virgin.

356
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,211
Congratulations.

357
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,051
Spain beat Italy.
Fair and square.

358
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,881
- What's that?
- The Eurocup. Soccer.

359
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,525
Soccer bores me.

360
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,290
What about your friend?

361
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,166
Her as well.
She's a Russian tennis player.

362
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,971
What?
I love Russian tennis players.

363
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,524
Though I'm starting to wonder.

364
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,041
- Check her arm.
- What?

365
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,448
One arm should be stronger
than the other.

366
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,050
Yes, you are a tennis player.
Look at your right arm!

367
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,050
I'm left-handed!

368
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,449
I mean left, sorry. And you've got
calluses. This is the proof!

370
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,362
You two wanna have a trio?

372
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,849
Wanna see it first?

373
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,845
No, Max.

374
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,008
It's nice of you to offer, but no.

375
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,407
You speak Italian?

376
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,005
It's a beautiful language.

377
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,327
Please, go. Leave us alone.

378
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,561
I got my hopes up.

379
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,050
I thought it's what you wanted.

380
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,083
I'm sorry,
it was a misunderstanding.

381
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,328
We shouldn't have called you.

382
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,006
Good night.

383
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,203
I was only joking about the cucumber.

384
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,646
Well, thanks to Max,

385
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,049
I've discovered a Russian
tennis player who speaks Italian.

386
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,130
- I like football too.
- You lied to me.

387
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,688
That mansion on the island couldn't
be yours. There is no tennis court.

388
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,888
So you understood me before?

389
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,731
- When?
- When I spoke to you in Spanish.

390
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,366
Yes, and I was thrilled.

391
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:51,205
Thrilled?

392
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,971
- To hear that you scare me?
- Yes.

393
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,651
Come here.

394
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,562
I'm beginning to realise that
everything about you scares me.

395
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:12,162
Your eyes. Your mouth.

396
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,046
Your smile.

397
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,006
The way you speak.
The tone of your voice.

398
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,885
Your smell. Your scent.

399
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,048
Your breath.

400
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,970
Your stunning body.

401
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,208
Your skin.

402
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,085
Your skin is incredible.

403
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,721
I'm more scared by
the colour of yours.

404
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,208
Your skin is like the Russian steppe.

405
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,527
That's very scary.

406
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,883
A question.

408
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:09,287
If I had a twin sister,
identical in every way,

409
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,847
with the same eyes,
same mouth, voice...

410
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,008
And the same skin?

411
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,570
Yes, especially the skin.

412
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:25,564
- Would you be that scared?
- Do you have a twin sister?

413
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,808
It's just hypothetical.

414
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:33,404
I don't know.
Maybe I would, maybe I wouldn't.

415
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,040
What do you prefer?

416
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:41,963
I just feel very fortunate that
it's me here, and not my twin sister.

417
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,560
OK, you have to explain me this.

418
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:51,160
I have a twin sister
with a degree in history of art.

419
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:56,370
She just finished her thesis
on the Italian Renaissance.

420
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,284
I came here with her.

421
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,402
- What's her name?
- Dasha.

422
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,769
Like you. Because you told me
your name was Natasha.

423
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:07,089
I don't know your name either.

424
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,042
Now I know
why your Italian is so good.

425
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,687
I also studied history of art.

426
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:19,407
But in our third year,
we both auditioned for a film

427
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,642
and they chose me.

428
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,240
Since then,
my sister and I drifted apart.

429
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:27,204
Can you prove it?

430
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,288
Prove?

431
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,687
- What does that say?
- Sasha Veronina.

432
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:58,170
Sasha? Natasha, Dasha, and now
Sasha? You're triplets or what?

433
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,882
So whats with the tennis?

434
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,049
My sister Dasha and I
have played since we were kids.

435
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,004
But she was always better than me.

436
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,202
When do you get to play tennis?

437
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:16,450
You can't have much time between
filming, parties and premieres.

438
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,680
Can you show me your sister?

439
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:47,690
Dasha is number ten
female tennis player in Russia.

440
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:53,769
- And she's left-handed like you.
- Yes, I am left-handed too.

441
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,202
There is no reason why twins
should both be left-handed,

442
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,971
even though they're identical
in every other way.

443
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,367
But we are.

444
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:07,570
Is there not anything different
between you two?

446
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,847
I was the first one
to become a woman.

447
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,361
Though not like you.

448
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,602
What do you mean?

449
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,124
My mother died when we were 13.

450
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:45,570
From that time, my father
started to treat me like a woman.

451
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,007
He used to only touch me.

452
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,966
And your sister?

453
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,526
No, just me.

454
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,042
- Why?
- I don't know.

455
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:08,722
But I felt like I should keep it
secret from my sister,

456
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,922
until one night...

457
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,003
Dasha saw us.

458
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:17,044
- How did she react?
- Badly.

459
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:20,130
She felt rejected and...

460
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:24,969
That's how
her inferiority complex began.

461
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:29,642
She got a complex because
your father didn't touch her up?

462
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,366
She should have been grateful.

463
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,171
That didn't last long,
less than a year.

464
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,684
Are you crying?

465
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,208
You can cry if you want.

466
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,282
The thing is I don't cry.

467
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,961
- You don't?
- Well, I haven't in a long time.

468
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,367
Crying is good for you.

469
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,522
I know.

470
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,970
So cry like an actress.
Come on, please.

471
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:27,369
- Act for me.
- That's what I am doing.

472
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:33,687
I will love to see you cry. Then
I'll have the chance to comfort you.

473
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,962
Come on.

474
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,651
Cry, CW...

475
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:49,923
Sorry, Alba.
I'm not a good actress.

477
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,764
Do I sing well?

481
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:34,091
I imagine in that Arabian harem,

482
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:37,010
you had all kinds of relations
with women.

483
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:43,084
- Or was it forbidden?
- I never lived in Saudi Arabia.

484
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:51,646
- Shame. I liked that story.
- So did I.

485
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:57,210
It was my mother who fled away
from Saudi Arabia in a Greek ship.

486
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:00,961
She was pregnant with me,
running away from my father.

487
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:06,246
I'm Hamir's daughter,
and I was born in Athens.

488
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:09,728
- I'm glad Alba exists.
- Thanks.

489
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,810
So, you are Greek not Spanish?

490
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:18,689
No, few months after I was born
my mother brought me back to Spain.

491
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,041
Did your mother
also become a lesbian?

492
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,561
Come on!

493
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:27,366
My mother had several men
and several problems,

494
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,205
but she always took care of me
and I took care of her.

495
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:33,802
And you,
have you ever been with a man?

496
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:38,323
I'm a lesbian from birth,
like you are a twin from birth.

497
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:48,010
Look, Alba, I... I haven't been
completely honest with you.

498
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:57,045
- I'm getting married next Sunday.
- Who?

499
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:00,050
- The actress or the tennis player?
- The tennis player.

500
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,322
Dasha?

501
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,770
So you are not the actress,
you are the twin.

502
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,406
My sister's also a twin.

503
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:12,370
Yeah, but I mean
the...the Renaissance one.

504
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,443
You are the Renaissance one.

506
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:25,210
OK, in...
in one way I prefer it,

507
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:28,449
but I... I don't like the idea
of you getting married so soon.

508
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:32,571
We've been planning it
for almost a year.

509
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:36,048
- Who with?
- The tutor supervising my thesis.

510
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:39,687
- Is he Italian?
- No he's from Moscow.

511
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:44,203
We've bought a small apartment.
We'll move in after our honeymoon.

512
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:49,087
- In one of those Russian beehives?
- Yes, very different from my sister.

513
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,771
I'm glad you are middle class.

514
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:56,725
But especially happy
that your father didn't touch you up.

515
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,889
So, then, you are the one
with the inferiority complex?

516
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,162
I don't get it.

517
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,767
One night I woke up and saw
my sister's bed was empty.

518
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:26,010
I decided to get up
and go to my father's room.

519
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:33,366
I remember his huge hands
with long and strong fingers...

520
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:41,124
caressing Sashas naked body
identical to mine.

521
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:47,640
I stayed there hidden for a while,
watching.

522
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:54,560
It was the first time in my life
I experienced sexual pleasure.

523
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:01,165
Every time I woke up
and my sister wasn't there,

524
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:07,287
I undressed and touched myself.

525
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,162
I understand you, little Russian.

526
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:19,370
That put an immense distance
between Sasha and me.

527
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,763
But now I like my life
so much more than my sister's.

528
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,042
That's good.

529
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,401
Now you can have
your own family.

530
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:34,164
<i>Please, hold still.</i>

531
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,167
<i>Alba, you said it wrong.</i>

532
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:41,208
<i>Then teach me how to say it!</i>

533
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:44,403
<i>We'll hold still
when you say it right.</i>

534
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,207
What are they speaking in?

535
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:53,723
Basque. It's a very, very ancient
language. It's quite difficult.

536
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,171
I'm trying to learn it,

537
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:59,524
but every time I make mistakes,
the kids make fun of me.

538
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:02,371
I want to have children too.

539
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,408
They're Edurne's kids.

540
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,851
- How long have you been with her?
- Two years.

541
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:29,366
She had just separated and I had just
come out of a stormy relationship.

542
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:32,444
One weekend she passed
through Madrid and we hooked up,

543
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:37,561
and a month later I moved
to San Sebastian to live with her.

544
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,011
<i>Mommy.</i>

545
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,850
<i>Give me a kiss.</i>

546
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,648
What's wrong?

547
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,331
Come on, Alba, please tell me.

548
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,885
The little boy,
he died last winter.

549
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,083
It was in a stupid accident
in the house.

550
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:16,807
I haven't watched this video
since it happened.

551
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:19,924
Edurne hasn't...
hasn't got over it.

552
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:37,723
The boy died with me at home.
We were both alone.

553
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:39,251
Edurne doesn't blame me,

554
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:45,208
but I wish she could have been there
that afternoon with him

555
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,209
and not me.

556
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:51,211
Who knows? Maybe the accident
wouldn't have happened.

557
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:11,329
How do you run with these legs?

558
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,080
What a wonderful sense of speed!

559
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,287
I bet you sprint like a gazelle.

560
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,169
How long have you been with him?

561
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:26,647
With Vadim?

562
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,967
Four years. Intense years.

563
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:34,405
- And you love him?
- Actually, I do, deeply.

564
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:38,201
I learn a lot being with him.
He is very cultured.

565
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:40,800
And he always knows what to do.

566
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:43,844
Had you ever been unfaithful to him?

567
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,604
No.

568
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,406
Had you to Edurne?

569
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,409
Me neither.

570
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,931
It hurts us both equally, right?

572
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:41,169
Would you like to give me
a wedding present?

573
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,209
Sure.

574
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,525
These are the ones left.

575
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:03,530
I don't know. What do you prefer?

576
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:05,847
Whatever you choose.

577
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:11,967
And what do I put? From Alba,
the Spanish girl in Rome?

578
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:16,005
Well, if you were a man
it might look suspicious.

579
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:21,763
I'll say that while I was in Rome
I met a very sweet Spanish girl.

580
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:25,009
- And cute.
- Gorgeous.

581
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:27,168
Vale.

582
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:32,531
Why are you here in Rome?

583
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:36,850
It's a wedding present
from my sister, a week in Italy,

584
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,406
an attempt to bring us together.

585
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:43,770
But tonight we had a fight
and I went off on my own.

586
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,406
So, I met you thanks to an argument?

587
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:51,528
- Is your sister a good actress?
- Yes, very good.

588
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:54,849
And she can cry wonderfully.

589
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,088
But it's also true
that her boyfriend is...

590
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:00,283
Mafioso?

591
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:07,046
What about you?
What are you doing here?

592
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:10,323
- Here?
- Yes, in Rome.

593
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,529
I'm here for the Alternative
Locomotion Energy Fair.

594
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,210
Future means of transport.

595
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:21,689
Ecological, clean vehicles
with low energy consumption.

596
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:24,167
Nice.

597
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:45,881
- What is it?
- It's called Aspasia.

598
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,207
It's perfect
for getting around in the city.

599
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:52,405
Maximum speed,
70 kilometers per hour. 40 miles.

600
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:55,040
It works like a bike.
You pedal it.

601
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,208
But if you need help
getting up a slope,

602
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:59,687
you connect a silent,
compressed air motor,

603
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:01,643
and if it rains, you don't get wet.

604
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,888
Who invented this thing?

605
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,890
Me.

606
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,161
What?

607
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:09,361
What?

608
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:12,763
- Don't I look like an inventor?
- Actually, no.

609
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,962
I am a mechanical engineer.

610
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:18,846
Came top in my year.

611
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:22,887
- It makes sense.
- Why?

612
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,641
Because you are the best woman
I've ever met.

613
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:32,164
Thanks, love.

614
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:35,250
- Don't call me love.
- Why?

615
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:40,048
- Love is something else.
- It is also for me.

616
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,731
That which I'm feeling right now
is very similar to love.

617
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:45,446
Almost identical.

618
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:49,969
Any love there might be here
right now is pure fantasy.

619
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,321
Like anywhere else!

620
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,163
Now I know what you can
give me as a present.

621
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,890
It's not in your wedding list.

622
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,642
I'm adding it now, and if you don't
get it for me, someone else will.

623
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:17,809
OK, I'll leave it here.

624
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:21,208
It's in the fair, for whoever
wants to come and pick it up.

625
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:25,086
- Was it a success?
- You bet.

626
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,646
I love it.

627
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:32,163
I'm sure it won't be long
before they ban all cars from cities

628
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:34,408
and introduce your Aspasias.

629
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:37,723
At the moment,
this is the only prototype.

630
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:40,320
One is enough for me in Moscow.

631
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:44,887
Be sure that if you get
my Aspasia as a present,

632
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,411
it comes with me inside.

633
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:49,291
We are inseparable.

634
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:52,085
Even better.

635
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,885
I also know who Aspasia was.

636
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:05,683
She lived there in that painting.

637
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:15,046
As soon as I walked into this room
a week ago, I noticed the picture

638
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:17,891
and I thought that was
a good sign for my Aspasia.

639
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,447
But just today I was told there is...

640
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,285
There is no chance
of it being manufactured.

642
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:29,410
So you went out and got drunk?

643
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:32,040
The truth is,

644
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:35,642
since last winter,
after what happened to the boy,

645
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:39,810
there is not one night
I go to bed without drinking.

646
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:42,002
It helps me sleep.

647
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:46,011
Except tonight, you woke me up.

648
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,765
I should get going.

649
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:06,971
Can I have a shower first?

650
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,686
Yeah.

651
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:28,882
I'm sorry, Vadim, but I can
never tell you about this.

652
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:33,761
Now I have a secret too.

653
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:38,521
But it's much further away
than yours.

654
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:43,844
Maybe I missed
the sign in the painting.

655
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:45,371
It's you, my little Russian.

656
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,648
The good thing I was expecting.

657
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:52,163
You'll always have that...
my reflection.

658
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:56,925
This...

659
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:01,164
Is mine alone.

690
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:37,600
- I want to tell you something.
- Whatever you like.

691
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:41,846
Tonight before I met you,

692
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:44,201
my sister told me
something at dinner

693
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:49,167
that deep down I imagined
but never had the courage to ask.

694
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:54,570
We had drunk a lot of wine
and we were having a very good time,

695
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:59,766
until she told me
that Vadim was with her before me.

696
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:06,689
He was also my sister's teacher
but we were in different classes.

697
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,201
When she got the part
we auditioned for

698
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:12,244
and stopped coming
to the university,

699
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:17,207
he called her and they were
together for a while.

700
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:22,081
It was her who left him.

701
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:27,848
I imagine between them
they decided not to tell me anything,

702
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:30,566
until tonight
my sister let it slip.

703
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:36,209
Don't tell anyone, but I like you
much more than your sister.

704
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:43,284
And white suits you much better.

706
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,962
The guests are waiting.

707
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:59,803
My sister was thinking of inviting
several friends of her boyfriend.

708
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,445
Dodgy people.

709
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:04,331
Actually, that was why we argued.

710
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:09,367
Well done.
We don't want mafiosos here.

711
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,528
If anyone has anything to say,

712
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:17,531
let him speak now
or forever hold his peace.

713
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,404
Me.

714
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:24,006
We are all listening, bride.

715
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:30,245
The weird thing is,
I'm worried about Vadim now.

716
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:33,887
In case my sister's boyfriend
finds out. He's an animal.

717
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,526
And you? What about you?

718
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:39,369
Me?

719
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,801
I know Vadim is in love with me.

720
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,368
I love the way you are.
You're such a good person.

721
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,251
The best of all of us.

722
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:54,365
And I'm sure you're right,
Vadim loves you.

723
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,522
You above all.

724
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:02,688
Another strange thing.

725
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:07,044
Vadim has always reminded me
of someone from the Renaissance.

726
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:09,527
One person in particular.

727
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,961
Who?

728
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:17,529
That guy,
the one speaking over your bed.

729
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:24,009
It's Leon Battista Alberti,
one of my favourite humanists.

730
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,442
He said that
you can't pull the string

731
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,524
without having a dartboard to aim at.

732
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,808
What does that mean?

733
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:40,371
The idea is that the artist must know
at all times what he's representing.

734
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:50,526
The picture shows a symposium
in the Medici Palace.

735
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:54,640
I'm sure he was talking
about the Greeks.

736
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:56,808
He was fascinated by them.

737
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:01,528
That painting speaks of the other.

738
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:06,366
There are 20 centuries
between these two pictures.

739
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:09,000
In our case, only one room.

740
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,002
We look like
we're at a tennis match.

741
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:09,040
Conclusion.

742
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:12,687
Here beneath the city of my birth,
do you love me?

743
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:18,003
Well, I don't know why,

744
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:20,930
but right now...

745
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:26,125
yes, I am loving you.

746
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,601
With fantasies or without?

747
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:38,690
With both.

748
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,849
I look good in white too, don't I?

749
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:48,447
A new day is coming.

750
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:52,047
Dawn is my moment.

751
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:54,811
I'll stay
and watch the dawn with you

752
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:57,366
and then we say goodbye.

764
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:42,845
I'm going to order breakfast for two.

765
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:48,769
- I'll call my sister, then.
- Very well, little Russian.

766
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:54,887
<i>- Can I help you?</i>
- Yes.

767
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,048
We want to be the first
to have breakfast.

768
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:59,003
<i>Glad to hear it.</i>

769
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:01,441
<i>What would you like?
Something light, heavy?</i>

770
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,887
As heavy as it gets.

771
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,367
<i>- You want it to last?</i>
- Yes, please.

772
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,682
<i>- A nice big breakfast then.</i>
- Thanks, Max.

773
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:12,889
Don't worry.

774
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:18,640
Can I hear your sister's voice?

775
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,889
<i>I hardly slept because of you.</i>

776
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,889
<i>And I don't like flying
when I'm tired.</i>

777
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,764
It's like they split
your voice in two.

778
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,765
<i>Who is that?</i>

779
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,891
Room service.

780
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,365
She brought breakfast.

781
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:38,765
<i>- You're having breakfast?</i>
- Yes. I'm hungry.

783
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:40,769
I'll see you at the hotel after.

784
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:46,764
Are you never going to tell her?

785
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:52,808
So, then, what's the plan?
Pass through here without a trace?

786
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:56,083
Without...
without ever telling anyone?

787
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:59,886
That's up to each of us.

788
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,210
But there has to be something of us,
of both of us,

789
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,368
to remind us of this night.

790
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,761
Like what?

791
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:03,361
There is no wind yet.
It's early.

792
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:08,207
When it blows,
they'll take the photo.

793
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:12,041
You'll see. They owe it to us.

794
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:17,246
What a beautiful thing
you've just said, little Russian.

795
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:20,967
- Your idea was the best of all.
- We make a good team.

796
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:28,042
But we can only be seen
from a satellite.

797
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:31,164
Oh, wow. You're inspired.

798
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:33,850
By you.

799
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:38,687
That deserves a kiss.

800
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:07,971
- Max.
- Maximo.

801
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:10,162
Our breakfast.

802
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:16,725
Hi.

803
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:19,889
- Good morning.
- It certainly is.

804
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,002
We're outside, on the terrace.

805
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:30,002
Today's the first day of summer.

806
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,809
There you go.

807
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,968
This time it was easy.

808
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:39,641
You wanted two large breakfasts
and here they are.

809
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:41,171
Thank you, Max.

810
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:47,329
What's that?

821
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:46,040
Well, now we have a best man.

822
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:49,528
Couldn't be better.

823
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:12,008
I think the daylight
will be good for us.

824
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:14,407
I'm sure. It usually is.

825
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:19,521
Hey, the sun looks
fantastic on your face.

826
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:23,770
In your eyes. On your lips.

827
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:28,169
Well, look at your skin.
The steppe is turning gold. Scary.

828
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,681
- I'm even more scared.
- Why?

829
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,447
Because I know
what I'm seeing and feeling.

830
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:47,004
Shall we play at being brave?

832
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:55,560
If we didn't have partners,
what would we do, you and me?

833
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:59,571
I don't know.
It's all so new to me.

834
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:03,729
- Shall we stay and live in Roma?
- I'm in love with Rome.

835
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:07,367
We'll stay and live in Rome, then.

836
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:12,003
Would you do it?
Would you leave Edurne and her kids?

837
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,964
Sorry. Her daughter.

838
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:17,082
To live with me here in Rome?

839
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:22,961
This is real, Natasha, not a fantasy.

840
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:27,842
I feel it with absolute clarity.

841
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:32,887
The gates are opening for us.
Can't you hear them?

843
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,760
Close your eyes.

844
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:47,447
If our hands meet in the middle of
the table, we enter together, deal?

845
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:50,331
Deal.

851
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:25,091
You gave me a shock!

852
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:28,850
You're the one who shocked me!

853
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:30,041
What, my love?

854
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:31,366
Electricity.

855
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:33,451
Electricity.

856
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,888
This is because we are
very sure about this, no?

857
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:42,530
I don't know, but right now it's
what I most desire in this world.

858
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:47,205
Yes.

859
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:50,686
Yes.

860
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:53,371
- Yes?
- Yes.

861
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:06,600
And how do you want me to
call you? Dasha or Natasha?

862
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:09,528
Natasha.

863
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:10,971
What?

864
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:13,526
Natasha.

865
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:15,563
- Sha.
- Sha.

866
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:17,682
This is the name
I invented for you.

870
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:36,889
And I get to see you run.

871
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:40,891
I can't wait to go outside and...
and watch you sprint with your long logs.

872
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,890
I promise you will.

874
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:33,207
What is it?

875
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:34,845
<i>Dasha, what's going on?</i>

876
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:37,247
Nothing, I'll get dressed
and come right over.

877
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:40,648
- You're not dressed?
- No, I'm wearing white.

878
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:42,888
You're ahead of the wedding.

879
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,161
Yeah, way ahead.

880
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:46,442
I don't understand you, Dasha

881
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:48,125
Good.

882
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:35,011
Get into the bath
with me, please.

883
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:40,811
No.

884
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:44,641
Just a bath together
in each other's arms.

885
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:47,445
Without doing anything.

886
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:52,288
We will suffer more and it will
make it harder to say goodbye.

887
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:54,641
Harder?

888
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:57,966
Natasha.

889
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:03,166
Never before in my whole life
have I known a love like this.

890
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:06,170
Not this way.

891
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:09,329
And it can't all be nothing.

892
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:16,203
Are you sure
you want to part forever?

893
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,846
Yes.

894
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:53,002
Don't lower yourself.

895
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:54,884
Fight!

896
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,288
That's what I'm doing.

897
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:00,368
I'm fighting for you.

898
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:06,011
Do you think
it's not the same for me?

899
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:10,002
Let's hold each other.

900
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:13,325
No!

901
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:29,882
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I don't know what's happening to me.

902
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,401
I'm sorry. You're right.

903
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,881
I will stay here.

904
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,162
I will stay here. I prefer it.

905
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,287
What is it, Alba?

906
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:47,971
Don't suffer like this! Please!

907
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,367
Alba.

908
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:32,524
You are right.
I understand you perfectly.

909
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:40,687
Never before I had loved as
intensely as I do tonight with you.

910
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:43,406
Really?

911
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:51,721
From now on, we can think that for
once in our lives we experienced it.

912
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:54,684
The best thing
is to leave it here.

913
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:58,885
Keep it forever between the two of us
so it never fades.

914
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:02,965
- In the bathtub?
- Sure.

915
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:06,766
Where else?

916
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:30,127
One last turn?

917
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:33,368
Where?

918
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:36,171
In our bathtub.

919
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:38,760
To leave everything here.

931
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:06,684
Alba.

933
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:57,171
I'm taking a taxi to the airport.
It's that way.

934
01:41:57,280 --> 01:42:00,523
Hotel Ninfa
is in the other direction.

935
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:04,048
So, goodbye.

936
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:06,049
No kisses.

937
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:09,209
- You're sure?
- Absolutely.

938
01:42:09,320 --> 01:42:11,049
OK.

939
01:42:11,160 --> 01:42:15,210
But don't forget,
I kissed the soles of your feet.

940
01:42:15,320 --> 01:42:18,881
- I didn't kiss yours.
- No.

941
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,049
- Shall I kiss them now?
- No.

942
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:24,367
It would make the goodbye harder.

943
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:02,531
- Alba!
- What?

944
01:43:02,641 --> 01:43:04,848
Look!
