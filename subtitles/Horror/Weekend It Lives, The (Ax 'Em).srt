1
00:01:03,607 --> 00:01:04,835
You're dead, bitch!

2
00:01:14,585 --> 00:01:16,382
What the hell you lookin' at?

3
00:01:31,335 --> 00:01:33,235
Fuckin' hell.

4
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,584
looks like you are
shit outta luck, beautiful.

5
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,683
Now I'm gonna give you
your C-section.

6
00:01:53,357 --> 00:01:54,585
You son of a bi...

7
00:01:59,263 --> 00:02:00,730
Eat your vegetables.

8
00:02:00,764 --> 00:02:01,753
She's in here!

9
00:02:02,433 --> 00:02:03,866
Come on!

10
00:02:05,102 --> 00:02:06,467
Where is she?

11
00:02:09,607 --> 00:02:10,699
There she is!

12
00:02:12,376 --> 00:02:13,934
- Get out of here!
- Over there!

13
00:02:15,713 --> 00:02:17,044
Kill her on sight!

14
00:02:22,853 --> 00:02:24,218
Who the fuck is that?

15
00:02:24,255 --> 00:02:25,950
Where the hell is the girl?

16
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:33,096
Get him!

17
00:02:41,305 --> 00:02:43,364
Jesus!

18
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:53,439
Oh, God! Fuck!

19
00:03:06,931 --> 00:03:09,297
Come on, push. Push!

20
00:03:16,407 --> 00:03:17,601
My hand!

21
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,937
- Do you know what I hate?
- No.

22
00:03:22,012 --> 00:03:25,504
I hate these 40-year-old jack-holes
wearing ponytails.

23
00:03:27,017 --> 00:03:29,144
- That ponytail doesn't make you look hip...
- Come on.

24
00:03:29,186 --> 00:03:31,086
...young, or cool.

25
00:03:32,223 --> 00:03:34,987
OK, it's comin'. Come on.

26
00:03:35,025 --> 00:03:36,083
Give me one big push.

27
00:03:48,038 --> 00:03:49,403
What the fuck?

28
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,877
I'm bleedin'. I'm bleedin' out.

29
00:03:57,948 --> 00:04:00,007
Quit squirming,
you're ruining my shot.

30
00:04:04,688 --> 00:04:05,814
What a piece of crap.

31
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:10,554
We're outta here.

32
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,293
Sorry about
the messy delivery, Mom.

33
00:04:26,877 --> 00:04:28,174
We need quiet.

34
00:04:28,245 --> 00:04:29,371
Give Junior something to drink.

35
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,039
Bravo, Mr. Hero. Bravo.

36
00:04:56,073 --> 00:04:57,665
Why you tryin' to kill this woman?

37
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,443
Something funny?

38
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:03,969
Oh, I was just remembering
a limerick.

39
00:05:04,048 --> 00:05:06,516
Well, 'There once was a woman
who was quite begat...

40
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:09,313
'She had three babies
named Nat, Pat and Tat...

41
00:05:09,353 --> 00:05:10,820
'She said it was fun
at the breeding...

42
00:05:10,854 --> 00:05:13,254
'But found it was hell
in the feeding...

43
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,851
'When she saw there was
no tit for Tat.'

44
00:05:16,894 --> 00:05:20,022
You have caused me
no end of trouble.

45
00:05:20,064 --> 00:05:22,430
But now I shall return the favor.

46
00:05:22,466 --> 00:05:24,229
Tit for tat, right?

47
00:05:25,703 --> 00:05:28,604
Now, see, that's the latest thing.

48
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,436
The gun will only fire
when it recognizes...

49
00:05:30,474 --> 00:05:32,066
the thumbprint of the owner.

50
00:05:32,109 --> 00:05:35,476
It makes firearms safer
and it cuts down the crime too.

51
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,640
Get him!

52
00:05:47,825 --> 00:05:49,452
Who are you?

53
00:05:49,493 --> 00:05:51,859
lady, what's your name?

54
00:06:49,787 --> 00:06:51,186
Nice knockers.

55
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,065
God damn it!

56
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,779
Fuck you, ya fuckin' fuckers.

57
00:07:49,146 --> 00:07:51,114
Tit for tat, Mr. Hero.

58
00:07:51,148 --> 00:07:52,740
Tit for tat.

59
00:07:58,856 --> 00:08:00,153
Get him in there. Come on.

60
00:08:01,725 --> 00:08:03,158
I was goin' back for her, boss.

61
00:08:03,193 --> 00:08:05,320
No, I got it.

62
00:08:05,362 --> 00:08:08,092
Hey, I'm not the head honcho
who sits on his hands...

63
00:08:08,131 --> 00:08:09,689
warming them
with his own exhaust...

64
00:08:09,733 --> 00:08:11,132
while everybody else
does the work.

65
00:08:11,168 --> 00:08:12,965
Every second counts, right?

66
00:08:17,508 --> 00:08:20,272
Now, how the heck
did this happen, huh?

67
00:08:25,082 --> 00:08:26,982
Everything was goin' smooth
at the safe house...

68
00:08:27,618 --> 00:08:28,846
...when the woman draws a gun.

69
00:08:28,886 --> 00:08:31,855
I mean, who expects a pregnant
lady to pull a piece on ya, eh?

70
00:08:31,922 --> 00:08:34,220
And who was this man
who was with her?

71
00:08:34,258 --> 00:08:35,657
I don't know.

72
00:08:35,692 --> 00:08:37,626
After the woman escaped,
we tracked her here.

73
00:08:37,661 --> 00:08:39,151
This guy, he was hangin' around...

74
00:08:39,196 --> 00:08:40,424
at the bus stop.

75
00:08:40,464 --> 00:08:42,329
I mean, so we decided
that we'd deal with him later...

76
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:43,765
but we go after the woman...

77
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,859
he gets in on the action. You know?

78
00:08:45,903 --> 00:08:48,201
He took a gun,
he started shootin' at us,

79
00:08:48,238 --> 00:08:49,671
and that's...
that's when y...

80
00:08:49,706 --> 00:08:51,037
- Oh. OK.
...you arrived.

81
00:08:51,074 --> 00:08:53,042
Take it easy. Sit down.

82
00:08:53,076 --> 00:08:54,236
All right.

83
00:08:54,278 --> 00:08:55,506
Oh, you all right?

84
00:08:55,913 --> 00:08:57,141
OK.

85
00:08:58,282 --> 00:08:59,749
Are you tryin' to tell me...

86
00:08:59,816 --> 00:09:03,183
that some bum
came to her rescue?

87
00:09:03,253 --> 00:09:06,279
Well, well, well,
this is a fine mess, huh?

88
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,687
I won't make
this mistake again.

89
00:09:09,826 --> 00:09:11,817
Well, I got a piece of lead
in my butt as a reminder.

90
00:09:11,862 --> 00:09:12,886
OK.

91
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,592
I can appreciate that.

92
00:09:16,366 --> 00:09:17,856
My ass!

93
00:09:18,735 --> 00:09:21,329
And let that be a reminder
never to fail me again.

94
00:10:31,108 --> 00:10:32,097
Damn.

95
00:11:08,945 --> 00:11:10,913
Don't make me kill you
to get the baby.

96
00:12:05,502 --> 00:12:07,470
Back off.

97
00:12:58,355 --> 00:13:01,654
Sweetie, this deal is almost done.

98
00:13:01,691 --> 00:13:05,127
look, I've already booked
my flight home.

99
00:13:05,162 --> 00:13:06,993
OK?

100
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,622
OK.

101
00:13:08,665 --> 00:13:10,656
I love you too.

102
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,531
Yeah. Bye-bye.

103
00:13:15,572 --> 00:13:18,302
You know why a gun
is better than a wife?

104
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,199
Don't know.

105
00:13:21,244 --> 00:13:24,771
Well, you can put
a silencer on a gun.

106
00:13:31,054 --> 00:13:32,248
Sir, we spotted the target...

107
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:34,257
at Third and Jefferson heading
toward the park.

108
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,315
Turn us around.

109
00:13:41,097 --> 00:13:42,428
Come on! Dad!

110
00:13:42,465 --> 00:13:45,059
- Come on.
- All right.

111
00:13:45,101 --> 00:13:47,194
Who's Daddy's little girl?

112
00:14:05,922 --> 00:14:09,289
Don't worry, kid.
Someone good'll find you.

113
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,967
Oh, my God, look at this.

114
00:14:23,306 --> 00:14:25,866
Someone left a baby.

115
00:14:32,048 --> 00:14:33,015
Oops.

116
00:15:04,014 --> 00:15:05,606
Fuck me sideways.

117
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,439
Welcome back, Mr. Smith.

118
00:15:35,512 --> 00:15:36,979
Where's Quintana?

119
00:15:37,047 --> 00:15:40,116
Wait, Smith, Mistress Donna's
with a customer.

120
00:15:40,116 --> 00:15:41,105
Wait, you can't go up there.

121
00:15:41,184 --> 00:15:42,515
Oh, yeah, baby.

122
00:15:42,552 --> 00:15:44,315
- Smith?
- You like that, huh?

123
00:15:44,354 --> 00:15:46,379
Besides, I thought Mistress Mary
was more your type.

124
00:15:46,423 --> 00:15:48,220
You can't go up there.

125
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:32,035
Sorry, pal, the bar's closed.

126
00:16:39,642 --> 00:16:41,337
Wait your turn, Smith.

127
00:16:41,378 --> 00:16:42,675
There's plenty to go around.

128
00:16:42,746 --> 00:16:45,715
Not for me, thanks.
I'm lactose intolerant.

129
00:16:45,749 --> 00:16:48,149
Just tell me
what you want, Smith.

130
00:17:00,096 --> 00:17:01,085
Kinky.

131
00:17:01,131 --> 00:17:03,929
I want you to take care of this
baby for a while.

132
00:17:03,967 --> 00:17:05,229
Five grand.

133
00:17:05,268 --> 00:17:07,327
That should keep you off your
back for a couple of weeks.

134
00:17:10,173 --> 00:17:11,470
Are you clean?

135
00:17:11,508 --> 00:17:14,341
You know
I'm a good Girl Scout.

136
00:17:14,377 --> 00:17:15,435
So you'll do it.

137
00:17:15,478 --> 00:17:18,572
<i>Vaffanculo.</i>
Screw yourself, Smith.

138
00:17:18,648 --> 00:17:21,116
For all I know,
you snatched the kid.

139
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,051
I don't want to be an accessory
for kidnapping.

140
00:17:23,086 --> 00:17:24,815
I didn't steal the kid, trust me.

141
00:17:24,854 --> 00:17:27,015
Trust you?

142
00:17:27,057 --> 00:17:30,220
I don't even know your real name.

143
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,852
Who are you really, Smith?

144
00:17:32,829 --> 00:17:34,820
I'm a British nanny...

145
00:17:34,864 --> 00:17:36,161
and I'm dangerous.

146
00:17:46,076 --> 00:17:50,069
Just keep the baby for one day
and you can keep the whole roll.

147
00:18:03,726 --> 00:18:04,852
Forget it, Dad.

148
00:18:08,698 --> 00:18:09,960
Fine.

149
00:18:12,469 --> 00:18:14,403
<i>Ciao.</i>

150
00:19:09,392 --> 00:19:10,950
Breast milk.

151
00:19:14,497 --> 00:19:15,623
let's go.

152
00:19:15,932 --> 00:19:18,230
This lady's baby needs to be fed.

153
00:19:18,268 --> 00:19:21,066
Find me every wet nurse,
lactating hooker...

154
00:19:21,104 --> 00:19:23,538
and mammary on tap
in the city.

155
00:19:25,975 --> 00:19:28,842
I already told you, Smith,
you're not welcome...

156
00:19:28,878 --> 00:19:30,778
in the land of milk and honey.

157
00:19:33,983 --> 00:19:37,384
I need a little cream for
my coffee and some answers.

158
00:19:40,056 --> 00:19:43,025
I'm sorry.

159
00:19:44,794 --> 00:19:46,659
Scram, fellas.

160
00:19:46,696 --> 00:19:50,063
Give me a moment alone
here with, uh...

161
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:52,260
<i>Caffé la Mamma.</i>

162
00:19:52,302 --> 00:19:55,999
Relax. Relax.

163
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,532
<i>Mia piccola troietta.</i>

164
00:20:05,281 --> 00:20:10,446
There was a man here
with a baby not too long ago.

165
00:20:10,486 --> 00:20:12,545
Yes. A real jerk.

166
00:20:13,256 --> 00:20:17,727
He wanted me
to take care of the kid.

167
00:20:17,727 --> 00:20:20,093
And what is this man's name?

168
00:20:20,897 --> 00:20:22,660
Smith.

169
00:20:22,699 --> 00:20:24,633
Mr. Smith.

170
00:20:29,772 --> 00:20:32,036
How the hell
do I know his real name?

171
00:20:32,075 --> 00:20:34,202
He saw me a couple of times...

172
00:20:34,244 --> 00:20:36,371
when I was pulling straight tricks.

173
00:20:36,446 --> 00:20:38,880
He always used
the same name... Smith.

174
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,718
I don't believe you.

175
00:20:45,755 --> 00:20:48,918
I think you know
more about this man.

176
00:20:52,829 --> 00:20:54,296
He was a lousy tipper.

177
00:20:58,167 --> 00:21:05,642
It gets hotter the more times it's fired.

178
00:21:05,642 --> 00:21:08,406
If I had anything on him,
I'd tell you.

179
00:21:14,951 --> 00:21:19,650
And it gets a lot more
painful the closer I get.

180
00:21:24,794 --> 00:21:26,591
What's up, Doc?

181
00:21:26,629 --> 00:21:30,156
Oh, you're a 'wascally wabbit.'

182
00:21:33,102 --> 00:21:35,332
But you're not 'wascally' enough.

183
00:21:35,371 --> 00:21:37,464
Yeah?

184
00:21:37,507 --> 00:21:39,441
That's a six-shooter.

185
00:21:40,176 --> 00:21:42,269
I just counted six shots.

186
00:21:43,746 --> 00:21:46,146
You've blown your load.

187
00:21:52,355 --> 00:21:53,822
Yeah, well, what about you?

188
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,723
Your 9-millimeter is empty too.

189
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:59,956
Yeah, you fired 8 on the rooftop,
one in the men's room...

190
00:21:59,996 --> 00:22:02,965
and your second cartridge
was expended at the playground.

191
00:22:02,965 --> 00:22:05,661
And you won't be getting it up
with that gun you took off my man.

192
00:22:05,702 --> 00:22:07,863
Oh, no. Well, you see,
like my weapon...

193
00:22:07,904 --> 00:22:10,998
it also has the thumbprint
safety device.

194
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,837
Oh, really?

195
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,072
Wanna bet?

196
00:22:34,697 --> 00:22:36,790
Nothin' like a good hand job.

197
00:22:46,743 --> 00:22:49,974
Get your things. We're goin'.

198
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,381
I don't understand a word
you're going on about...

199
00:22:59,422 --> 00:23:02,323
but I know exactly what you're saying
and I refuse to apologize.

200
00:23:02,358 --> 00:23:05,327
Damn you, Smith. I could have
been snuffed back there.

201
00:23:05,361 --> 00:23:08,023
Yeah, you should be thanking me
for saving your sweet back door.

202
00:23:08,064 --> 00:23:10,225
Why did you wait so goddamn long?

203
00:23:10,266 --> 00:23:12,291
You're a bad girl,
you deserve to be punished.

204
00:23:12,335 --> 00:23:14,303
Which car do you want?

205
00:23:14,337 --> 00:23:16,532
- What?
- I'm tired of walking.

206
00:23:18,608 --> 00:23:20,371
look at this.

207
00:23:25,047 --> 00:23:26,309
You wanna know the difference...

208
00:23:26,382 --> 00:23:29,215
between this luxury car
and a porcupine?

209
00:23:29,252 --> 00:23:30,276
I give up.

210
00:23:31,754 --> 00:23:34,018
With the car,
the pricks are on the inside.

211
00:23:35,358 --> 00:23:37,349
Tell me about it.

212
00:23:54,377 --> 00:23:56,140
Hello, honey.

213
00:23:57,814 --> 00:23:59,281
Oh, good, good, I'm glad...

214
00:23:59,315 --> 00:24:01,476
I'm glad you liked the flowers.
Good.

215
00:24:02,318 --> 00:24:04,286
listen, sweetie...

216
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,720
I've run into a small hitch.

217
00:24:08,691 --> 00:24:11,387
I think I'm gonna have to be
out here for a while longer.

218
00:24:11,427 --> 00:24:13,725
But don't worry.

219
00:24:13,763 --> 00:24:16,061
I will be back in time
for Timmy's birthday party...

220
00:24:16,098 --> 00:24:17,725
I swear to you.

221
00:24:17,767 --> 00:24:19,496
Hugs and kisses.

222
00:24:19,535 --> 00:24:21,196
Bye-bye.

223
00:24:22,338 --> 00:24:24,067
So, what was I supposed to do?

224
00:24:24,106 --> 00:24:26,199
These guys were stalking
this pregnant lady.

225
00:24:26,242 --> 00:24:27,402
I couldn't just stand there.

226
00:24:29,912 --> 00:24:32,506
Did you see that?
I fuckin' hate that.

227
00:24:32,582 --> 00:24:34,277
- What?
- This guy, changin' lanes...

228
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,544
without signaling.

229
00:24:35,618 --> 00:24:37,552
I mean, how hard is it
to use your signal?

230
00:24:39,355 --> 00:24:41,789
So you started shooting at them?

231
00:24:41,824 --> 00:24:44,156
No, I don't carry a piece.

232
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:46,127
I went to the woman. She had a gun.

233
00:24:46,162 --> 00:24:48,289
They started firing, I shot back.

234
00:24:48,331 --> 00:24:50,424
He's done it again.

235
00:24:50,466 --> 00:24:52,457
I move my finger one inch...

236
00:24:52,502 --> 00:24:53,969
to use my turn signal.

237
00:24:54,003 --> 00:24:55,493
Why are these assholes so lazy...

238
00:24:55,538 --> 00:24:58,473
they can't move their finger
one fucking measly inch...

239
00:24:58,508 --> 00:24:59,873
to drive more safely?

240
00:25:00,843 --> 00:25:02,936
- You wanna know why?
- Not particularly.

241
00:25:02,979 --> 00:25:04,310
Because these rich bastards
have to...

242
00:25:04,347 --> 00:25:05,905
be callous and inconsiderate
in the first place...

243
00:25:05,982 --> 00:25:07,643
to make all that money,
so when they get on the road...

244
00:25:07,717 --> 00:25:09,116
they can't help themselves.
They've gotta be...

245
00:25:09,151 --> 00:25:11,312
callous and inconsiderate
drivers too.

246
00:25:11,354 --> 00:25:12,378
It's in their nature.

247
00:25:12,455 --> 00:25:14,184
Why don't you take the baby
to the police?

248
00:25:14,223 --> 00:25:16,953
- I can't go to the police.
- Why not?

249
00:25:16,993 --> 00:25:18,517
I'm the Unabomber.

250
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:20,495
They caught the Unabomber.

251
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:21,622
That's what they think.

252
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:24,698
Stupid...

253
00:25:24,734 --> 00:25:26,361
Right. That's it.

254
00:25:36,746 --> 00:25:38,976
You are the angriest man
in the world.

255
00:25:39,048 --> 00:25:42,381
If I remember right,
you used to like it like that.

256
00:25:45,755 --> 00:25:48,087
Well, how many freelancers
have you got?

257
00:25:49,392 --> 00:25:51,622
Yeah? How many local boys?

258
00:25:52,695 --> 00:25:54,390
I need men, you understand?

259
00:25:56,232 --> 00:25:57,824
I need a lot more men.

260
00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:15,248
I want four mags...

261
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:18,185
a box of 9-millimeter
147 hollow-points...

262
00:26:19,655 --> 00:26:21,520
...and give me 50 FMJs.

263
00:26:28,097 --> 00:26:29,792
You're a little short.

264
00:26:29,832 --> 00:26:33,734
You lied. You said you had $5,000.

265
00:26:33,769 --> 00:26:36,101
How about we make up the
difference with food stamps?

266
00:26:36,138 --> 00:26:38,629
You wanna buy bullets
with food stamps?

267
00:26:38,674 --> 00:26:39,698
It's as good as cash.

268
00:26:39,742 --> 00:26:41,369
You're pathetic, Smith.

269
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,935
We'll wait for you outside.

270
00:26:44,013 --> 00:26:46,948
look, why don't I sign over this check
I got at the blood bank to you?

271
00:26:46,983 --> 00:26:49,008
lt'll more than cover it.

272
00:26:49,085 --> 00:26:51,246
Throw in that check you got
from the sperm bank...

273
00:26:51,287 --> 00:26:52,777
and got yourself a deal.

274
00:26:52,855 --> 00:26:54,789
I don't get that check
till Wednesday.

275
00:26:55,424 --> 00:26:57,619
listen, why don't you take
a half-a box of shells...

276
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,854
and I'll give you the other half...

277
00:26:58,894 --> 00:27:00,725
when you bring me the rest
of the money on Wednesday.

278
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,388
Deal.

279
00:27:28,324 --> 00:27:30,383
Damn it, Smith!

280
00:27:30,426 --> 00:27:31,791
What the hell are you doing?

281
00:27:31,827 --> 00:27:33,089
Making some money.

282
00:27:33,129 --> 00:27:34,653
- Making some money?
- Well, yeah.

283
00:27:34,697 --> 00:27:36,722
To buy something for the baby.

284
00:27:36,766 --> 00:27:38,461
Something for the baby?

285
00:27:42,838 --> 00:27:46,239
A bulletproof vest is a better
investment than a crib.

286
00:27:47,343 --> 00:27:50,904
Makes me think what you'd do
to get him in the right school.

287
00:27:53,416 --> 00:27:54,405
So this is it.

288
00:27:55,484 --> 00:27:58,044
It's not the Ritz but it's home.

289
00:27:59,355 --> 00:28:01,152
Same old Smith.

290
00:28:01,257 --> 00:28:02,485
Down and dirty.

291
00:28:02,525 --> 00:28:04,686
Glad you like it.

292
00:28:12,802 --> 00:28:13,996
Say hello to Mickey.

293
00:28:23,112 --> 00:28:25,342
Maybe I should take the baby
to the police.

294
00:28:25,414 --> 00:28:26,972
No, you'd never make it.

295
00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:28,516
They'll be watching
all the precincts...

296
00:28:28,584 --> 00:28:30,882
probably got some of the boys in blue
on payola too.

297
00:28:45,401 --> 00:28:46,959
I've rounded up 50 guys.

298
00:28:47,002 --> 00:28:48,697
Well, I guess that's just
gonna have to do, huh?

299
00:28:57,947 --> 00:29:00,313
Stop the car. He was here.

300
00:29:00,349 --> 00:29:02,214
Come on, what makes
you think he was here?

301
00:29:02,251 --> 00:29:05,015
Trust me. I know what people do
and I know what people think.

302
00:29:05,054 --> 00:29:08,512
I always have.
Even as a kid, I had this gift.

303
00:29:08,557 --> 00:29:10,821
Yeah, you shoulda seen
the playground hurt I laid down...

304
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,828
playin' rock, paper, scissors, buddy.

305
00:29:12,862 --> 00:29:15,023
Now stop the car.

306
00:29:16,132 --> 00:29:18,327
Who do you think
wants this baby dead?

307
00:29:18,367 --> 00:29:20,665
I've no idea who's tryin' to kill it.

308
00:29:20,703 --> 00:29:22,534
Don't call him an 'it.'

309
00:29:22,571 --> 00:29:24,232
It's an 'it' to me.

310
00:29:28,244 --> 00:29:31,213
Tell me, Smith,
is there anything you like?

311
00:29:31,247 --> 00:29:33,340
Yeah, my privacy.

312
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,782
Tell me something I don't know
<i>per una volta...</i>

313
00:29:40,823 --> 00:29:42,222
<i>brutto figlio di puttana bastardo.</i>

314
00:29:42,258 --> 00:29:44,783
I love it when you talk like that.

315
00:29:45,728 --> 00:29:47,559
Can I offer you anything?

316
00:29:49,198 --> 00:29:50,597
Carrot?

317
00:29:52,134 --> 00:29:54,068
It's good for your eyesight.

318
00:29:58,941 --> 00:30:00,465
Of all the squats in the city...

319
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:02,374
how does he know
Smith's in this one?

320
00:30:02,411 --> 00:30:04,003
Another lucky guess?

321
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:05,808
Nah, he doesn't guess.

322
00:30:05,881 --> 00:30:07,815
He sees things we don't.

323
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:10,819
He was once an FBI profiler.

324
00:30:10,886 --> 00:30:13,753
Forensic behavior consultant.

325
00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:16,758
My God, how many times
do I have to tell you guys?

326
00:30:16,792 --> 00:30:18,259
Details...

327
00:30:19,795 --> 00:30:23,356
...make all the difference
in this business.

328
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:24,923
Hey, but...

329
00:30:25,835 --> 00:30:27,928
Don't... you think
you should hang back, sir?

330
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:30,905
The leader who stays in the rear,
takes it in the rear.

331
00:30:35,711 --> 00:30:37,576
Besides...

332
00:30:41,984 --> 00:30:44,714
violence is one of
the most fun things to watch.

333
00:30:45,754 --> 00:30:47,051
No, no, no, baby, no.

334
00:30:47,089 --> 00:30:48,750
We could call him Oliver.

335
00:30:48,791 --> 00:30:51,351
- Oliver?
- Yeah, like Oliver Twist.

336
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:53,088
Because he's an orphan?

337
00:30:53,128 --> 00:30:54,254
'Cause I like the book.

338
00:30:54,296 --> 00:30:56,389
- You like the book.
- I didn't hate it.

339
00:30:56,432 --> 00:30:58,127
That's a first.

340
00:31:03,239 --> 00:31:05,935
Which birthday card do
you think I should go with here?

341
00:31:06,942 --> 00:31:08,500
Cute and cuddly?

342
00:31:09,078 --> 00:31:12,104
Or the one that says,
'You're becomin' a man now, son'?

343
00:31:15,851 --> 00:31:17,512
So, Mr. Hertz?

344
00:31:17,553 --> 00:31:18,952
How old is your son?

345
00:31:18,988 --> 00:31:20,546
He's 8.

346
00:31:20,589 --> 00:31:22,989
Then it had to be
large and powerful and...

347
00:31:23,893 --> 00:31:25,520
Can you believe it?

348
00:31:25,561 --> 00:31:26,653
There's nothing on the TV...

349
00:31:26,695 --> 00:31:28,356
- about any of this.
...without a trace.

350
00:31:32,201 --> 00:31:33,759
...roadside bomb wounded...

351
00:31:33,802 --> 00:31:34,996
We have it in our...

352
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,104
Hey. Do you notice that?

353
00:31:40,142 --> 00:31:41,575
Notice what?

354
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:43,373
look.

355
00:31:43,445 --> 00:31:47,882
lame-ass politician rants about
gun control, he cries.

356
00:31:49,184 --> 00:31:50,446
- So tonight...
- Switch to this channel...

357
00:31:50,486 --> 00:31:51,646
with this heavy metal music...

358
00:31:54,123 --> 00:31:55,215
...he shuts up.

359
00:31:56,425 --> 00:31:57,858
That's so weird.

360
00:32:01,163 --> 00:32:03,825
He must find it comforting.

361
00:32:03,866 --> 00:32:05,333
- Sir?
- Yeah?

362
00:32:05,367 --> 00:32:08,996
- Men are in place on the roof.
- That's good.

363
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:12,496
Anybody know what a
Jimmy Cagney love scene is?

364
00:32:13,642 --> 00:32:15,735
It's where Cagney
lets the good guy live.

365
00:32:19,982 --> 00:32:23,713
And if that happens in this show...

366
00:32:23,752 --> 00:32:26,414
I'm gonna do a lot more
than ask for my money back.

367
00:32:26,455 --> 00:32:30,516
All right? let's kill this mother. Go.

368
00:32:33,796 --> 00:32:36,993
It doesn't surprise me that
Oliver's into death metal.

369
00:32:37,032 --> 00:32:38,727
look at his surrogate parents.

370
00:32:38,767 --> 00:32:41,429
No, I'm telling ya, this means...

371
00:32:43,339 --> 00:32:44,738
Go. Back way.

372
00:35:12,754 --> 00:35:15,188
My God, do we really suck...

373
00:35:15,224 --> 00:35:17,454
or is this guy really that good?

374
00:35:17,493 --> 00:35:17,925
Come on, boys!

375
00:35:19,128 --> 00:35:21,028
He ain't out of the briar patch yet!

376
00:35:40,115 --> 00:35:41,980
Shoot the dog, shoot the dog.

377
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:43,279
No.

378
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,711
- Why not?
- I like dogs.

379
00:36:08,177 --> 00:36:09,906
Wait a minute.

380
00:36:12,848 --> 00:36:15,749
Oh, that rat bastard.

381
00:36:31,066 --> 00:36:32,192
What is it?

382
00:36:32,868 --> 00:36:34,233
It's the baby's diaper.

383
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:41,641
This idea blows, Smith.

384
00:36:41,677 --> 00:36:43,167
It's the only idea we got.

385
00:36:43,245 --> 00:36:45,713
You actually think
that Oliver's mother...

386
00:36:45,781 --> 00:36:47,840
lived near a heavy metal club...

387
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:51,352
...and that he could hear the music
while he was still inside the womb?

388
00:36:51,386 --> 00:36:52,785
Yep. That's why he doesn't cry...

389
00:36:52,821 --> 00:36:54,686
when he's listenin' to some
headbanger's bash.

390
00:36:54,723 --> 00:36:56,020
Ridiculous.

391
00:36:56,692 --> 00:36:58,057
Well, he isn't cryin' now.

392
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:05,293
So this is the only club near where
I encountered the baby's mother.

393
00:37:05,334 --> 00:37:07,802
I still say this is a wild hunch.

394
00:37:07,836 --> 00:37:10,168
Yeah? So how do you explain
all these boxes of diapers?

395
00:37:10,205 --> 00:37:12,070
Somebody's been stocking up.

396
00:37:12,107 --> 00:37:13,870
let's find out who.

397
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:34,026
- You the owner of this place?
- Who's askin'?

398
00:37:34,062 --> 00:37:35,620
I am.

399
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:40,267
- Can I buy you a drink?
- No.

400
00:37:42,804 --> 00:37:45,068
Just as I suspected.

401
00:37:45,107 --> 00:37:47,507
He really is into jewelry.

402
00:37:51,113 --> 00:37:52,603
Who occupies the
room upstairs?

403
00:37:52,681 --> 00:37:54,080
Go to hell.

404
00:37:54,116 --> 00:37:55,583
Don't mess with me.

405
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:57,482
<i>You ain't got the cojones.</i>

406
00:38:00,255 --> 00:38:01,779
Oh, God.

407
00:38:03,292 --> 00:38:05,123
So who were these guys?

408
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:09,062
I rented the place to some suit
11 months ago.

409
00:38:09,097 --> 00:38:11,622
He paid the whole year in cash.

410
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:13,134
I never saw him again.

411
00:38:13,168 --> 00:38:15,534
I just figured they were
usin' the back way.

412
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:23,505
Beat it.

413
00:38:38,894 --> 00:38:40,293
<i>Oh, madonna.</i>

414
00:38:41,697 --> 00:38:42,789
<i>Che orrore!</i>

415
00:38:43,432 --> 00:38:45,297
This is pretty fucked up.

416
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:17,391
Sir, it's your go-to guy.

417
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,965
All the mothers have been killed.

418
00:39:20,001 --> 00:39:22,435
Only one escaped, temporarily.

419
00:39:22,471 --> 00:39:25,907
We found her body and confirmed
that she did deliver a child.

420
00:39:27,209 --> 00:39:28,836
The babies were supposed
to be delivered covertly.

421
00:39:28,877 --> 00:39:30,572
I guess setting up this
maternity factory...

422
00:39:30,645 --> 00:39:33,614
on top of a heavy metal club
wasn't particularly secret.

423
00:39:33,682 --> 00:39:36,480
What a fine lot of
babysitters we turned out to be.

424
00:39:36,518 --> 00:39:39,248
When Mr. Go-To Guy passes,
head to the left.

425
00:39:39,287 --> 00:39:40,879
Yes, sir, I already made the call.

426
00:39:40,922 --> 00:39:43,584
Backup should be
arriving any minute.

427
00:39:43,625 --> 00:39:45,388
We'll clean this mess up
and try to piece together...

428
00:39:45,427 --> 00:39:46,621
everything that happened.

429
00:39:47,796 --> 00:39:50,890
Thank you, sir.
I appreciate your confidence.

430
00:39:52,067 --> 00:39:54,558
Gentlemen, let's find some answers.

431
00:39:58,707 --> 00:40:01,141
Watch where you step.

432
00:40:01,243 --> 00:40:04,371
- The ice cream is melting.
- What?

433
00:40:04,413 --> 00:40:06,813
I thought donor sperm
was your department.

434
00:40:07,315 --> 00:40:09,180
These freezers are full of samples.

435
00:40:10,886 --> 00:40:12,717
This is weird.

436
00:40:12,754 --> 00:40:14,551
There seems to be only one donor.

437
00:40:14,589 --> 00:40:16,113
One donor?

438
00:40:16,158 --> 00:40:18,524
Yeah. And a generous one at that.

439
00:40:27,335 --> 00:40:29,098
This is bone marrow blood.

440
00:40:29,137 --> 00:40:31,162
It must be for some kind of cure.

441
00:40:33,208 --> 00:40:34,641
How do you know that, Smith?

442
00:40:34,676 --> 00:40:36,576
You didn't hear about
my Nobel Prize?

443
00:40:44,386 --> 00:40:48,117
See, what it is, it's hard to find marrow
that matches that of the recipient.

444
00:40:48,156 --> 00:40:50,522
The odds are much better
if the donor marrow shares...

445
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:53,119
the same DNA with
the person receiving it.

446
00:40:54,563 --> 00:40:57,430
You mean these people were
harvesting babies...

447
00:40:57,466 --> 00:40:59,798
for some guy's
bone marrow transplant?

448
00:40:59,835 --> 00:41:02,963
Exactly. And somebody
wanted to make sure he didn't get it.

449
00:41:03,472 --> 00:41:05,736
That's why they want Oliver dead.

450
00:41:31,466 --> 00:41:33,263
No, my baby, no.

451
00:41:34,836 --> 00:41:37,236
So I called that guy I know at NBC.

452
00:41:37,272 --> 00:41:38,864
That's good.

453
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:41,107
And then I got to thinking.

454
00:41:41,142 --> 00:41:43,975
- You know what I hate?
- Here we go again.

455
00:41:44,045 --> 00:41:45,672
I hate those lame action movies...

456
00:41:45,747 --> 00:41:48,341
where the good guy calls
just one person who ends up betrayin' him.

457
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:52,747
Yeah. That's right up there
with killing baby seals.

458
00:41:52,787 --> 00:41:56,655
I called ABC, CBS,
<i>The Post, The Times...</i>

459
00:41:56,691 --> 00:41:59,159
the local news channel, and the FBI.

460
00:42:00,862 --> 00:42:02,853
So, what do we do next?

461
00:42:02,898 --> 00:42:04,889
I figure we hang here
and watch the news.

462
00:42:04,933 --> 00:42:07,663
Once the story goes public,
maybe we'll be safe.

463
00:42:09,004 --> 00:42:12,098
look. He finally went to sleep.

464
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,767
Yeah, you just wait.

465
00:42:13,808 --> 00:42:17,403
The moment you close
your eyes for a nap, he'll start screaming.

466
00:42:17,479 --> 00:42:20,915
You can't take a little pleasure
in anything, can you?

467
00:42:20,949 --> 00:42:22,940
You just hate everything.

468
00:42:23,585 --> 00:42:24,609
I don't hate you.

469
00:42:25,487 --> 00:42:26,954
Is that why you picked me?

470
00:42:27,022 --> 00:42:28,182
You know why I picked you.

471
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:31,524
You have no idea
what you've done to me.

472
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,790
We're gonna get out of this, trust me.

473
00:42:33,828 --> 00:42:36,763
- You just don't get it.
- What?

474
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:44,566
You bring me this child
so I can feed him, take care of him.

475
00:42:44,606 --> 00:42:47,769
A baby that could be dead
at any moment.

476
00:42:47,809 --> 00:42:50,073
And you never even think
to ask me...

477
00:42:50,145 --> 00:42:52,045
what happened to my own child.

478
00:42:57,118 --> 00:42:58,710
You're right.

479
00:43:01,189 --> 00:43:02,622
It's unforgivable.

480
00:43:05,527 --> 00:43:08,087
No. It's my fault.

481
00:43:08,863 --> 00:43:11,889
<i>It's like what my mamma</i>
always said...

482
00:43:11,933 --> 00:43:15,733
<i>' le uova non devono ballare
con le pietre.'</i>

483
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:18,830
If I say I'm sorry will
you tell me what that means?

484
00:43:19,975 --> 00:43:23,376
Eggs have no business
dancing with stones.

485
00:43:47,769 --> 00:43:49,634
You know, Smith...

486
00:43:49,671 --> 00:43:52,970
I figured out what you hate most...

487
00:43:53,008 --> 00:43:54,600
yourself.

488
00:43:57,646 --> 00:43:59,443
What happened to your baby?

489
00:43:59,514 --> 00:44:01,175
Forget about it.

490
00:44:01,316 --> 00:44:02,874
Tell me.

491
00:44:03,718 --> 00:44:06,278
My pimp hit me in the stomach.

492
00:44:07,522 --> 00:44:09,387
My baby...

493
00:44:09,424 --> 00:44:11,449
was delivered stillborn.

494
00:44:16,131 --> 00:44:17,758
- Get off of me!
- Hey.

495
00:44:34,883 --> 00:44:36,407
You like this, do ya?

496
00:44:40,755 --> 00:44:43,724
It's called a gun.

497
00:44:43,758 --> 00:44:49,287
Grip, slide, breech, barrel, trigger.

498
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:52,197
Now, this is the business end.

499
00:44:52,233 --> 00:44:55,828
You should never point this
at anything you don't intend to kill.

500
00:44:57,205 --> 00:45:01,266
Now, this is important.
This is called your safety.

501
00:45:01,376 --> 00:45:05,335
You have to keep this on to make sure
the gun doesn't go off accidentally.

502
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:10,317
But really, this is
your number one safety.

503
00:45:15,724 --> 00:45:17,589
Are you hungry?

504
00:47:18,246 --> 00:47:20,476
Talk about shootin' your load.

505
00:47:27,121 --> 00:47:28,247
look at this.

506
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:31,251
This is a Hammerson Nite Tac.

507
00:47:31,292 --> 00:47:33,522
These aren't supposed to
hit the streets for 6 months.

508
00:47:35,763 --> 00:47:37,822
This is weird.

509
00:47:37,866 --> 00:47:39,800
All these guys have got 'em.

510
00:47:44,806 --> 00:47:46,330
Don't even tell me.

511
00:47:46,374 --> 00:47:48,934
Do you know how many of our men
he's body-bagged now?

512
00:47:48,977 --> 00:47:53,038
Why should I waste my beautiful mind
on something like that?

513
00:47:53,114 --> 00:47:54,911
Doesn't it piss you off a little?

514
00:47:54,983 --> 00:47:57,008
Getting angry releases an enzyme...

515
00:47:57,085 --> 00:47:58,518
tryptophan hydroxylase...

516
00:47:58,553 --> 00:48:01,181
which can temporarily
reduce the I.Q.

517
00:48:01,222 --> 00:48:03,452
That's something I can't
afford to do right now.

518
00:48:03,491 --> 00:48:05,686
How do you know all that?

519
00:48:05,727 --> 00:48:07,820
My boy's hooked
on the Discovery Channel.

520
00:48:07,862 --> 00:48:10,353
Take me Westside.
I need to report in.

521
00:48:10,398 --> 00:48:12,889
I got a bead
on who our Mr. Hero is.

522
00:48:16,704 --> 00:48:17,932
No more arguments.

523
00:48:17,972 --> 00:48:19,997
I have to do this alone,
and the only way I can do it...

524
00:48:20,041 --> 00:48:22,168
is if I'm positive you two are OK.

525
00:48:24,245 --> 00:48:26,941
This is the only place
I know you'll be safe.

526
00:48:27,015 --> 00:48:29,984
- A tank?
- An M24 tank.

527
00:48:30,051 --> 00:48:32,417
You'll be safe from gunfire
and most explosives.

528
00:48:32,453 --> 00:48:35,251
- You're whacked.
- I am.

529
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:36,917
I'm also serious.

530
00:48:36,958 --> 00:48:39,051
But nobody's allowed to get in it.

531
00:48:39,093 --> 00:48:42,358
Don't worry. When I create
a diversion, you climb inside.

532
00:48:43,665 --> 00:48:44,893
You should have
enough of that baby food...

533
00:48:44,933 --> 00:48:46,798
to last you a couple of days.

534
00:48:46,834 --> 00:48:49,325
The puréed carrots are the best.

535
00:48:50,471 --> 00:48:52,268
Well, you know
how to use this, right?

536
00:48:54,075 --> 00:48:56,236
Yes, but what if
you don't come back?

537
00:48:56,978 --> 00:48:58,639
That's not gonna happen.

538
00:48:58,713 --> 00:49:00,374
There is no way to be sure.

539
00:49:02,283 --> 00:49:03,773
Yes, there is.

540
00:49:18,666 --> 00:49:22,033
<i>Tu sei una stella, la mia stella.</i>

541
00:49:23,638 --> 00:49:26,698
- But, Mom, I wanna go home!
- Stop whining!

542
00:49:26,741 --> 00:49:29,232
If you don't behave,
I am going to spank you.

543
00:49:29,277 --> 00:49:31,837
- But, Mom, I wanna go home!
- Stop whining.

544
00:49:31,913 --> 00:49:33,141
Stop it!

545
00:49:33,214 --> 00:49:34,306
I hate it when parents...

546
00:49:34,382 --> 00:49:36,247
- hit their children.
- let go of my arm!

547
00:49:36,284 --> 00:49:37,945
Not until you stop hittin' your kid.

548
00:49:37,986 --> 00:49:39,977
I will discipline
my child as I see fit.

549
00:49:40,054 --> 00:49:42,215
How would you like it
if I spanked you?

550
00:49:42,256 --> 00:49:43,245
What...?

551
00:49:44,125 --> 00:49:45,752
- See?
- Help!

552
00:49:45,793 --> 00:49:48,091
Doesn't feel so good, does it?

553
00:49:49,063 --> 00:49:50,257
Help!

554
00:49:50,298 --> 00:49:51,492
Help!

555
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,866
What the hell do you think you're doin'?

556
00:49:57,805 --> 00:49:59,136
It's not funny.

557
00:50:14,489 --> 00:50:18,357
So, what you got on this
all-star ground pounder?

558
00:50:18,393 --> 00:50:21,089
Well, anybody this good
had to start out young.

559
00:50:21,129 --> 00:50:24,496
And it's usually because
their pop was good at it too.

560
00:50:24,532 --> 00:50:26,762
You know, like
MacArthur's dad was a general...

561
00:50:26,801 --> 00:50:28,826
and Mickey Mantle's father
played pro ball.

562
00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:30,360
My son is a video game whiz...

563
00:50:30,405 --> 00:50:32,839
and I wasn't too bad at
Pong myself.

564
00:50:33,741 --> 00:50:36,437
Just follow me,
if you will, Mr. Hammerson.

565
00:50:36,477 --> 00:50:40,470
In '67, the limeys
got hard-ass on gun control.

566
00:50:40,548 --> 00:50:44,245
So a lot of Brit gunsmiths
moved to the States.

567
00:50:44,285 --> 00:50:46,515
Now, I've got an inside man
at lmmigration...

568
00:50:46,554 --> 00:50:49,523
working on which of
these guys had sons...

569
00:50:49,557 --> 00:50:51,616
and if any of the boys
were crack shots.

570
00:50:51,659 --> 00:50:54,025
I think the pucker factor's
gettin' to you.

571
00:50:54,695 --> 00:50:56,219
You got diddly!

572
00:50:58,232 --> 00:51:01,929
Yes, Duchess, you a good girl. Sit.

573
00:51:01,969 --> 00:51:04,767
Yes. Now's your treat.
Now you get your treat.

574
00:51:04,806 --> 00:51:06,501
My man has been
running the name down...

575
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:10,477
and he recalled one of these
gunsmith kids, actually.

576
00:51:11,913 --> 00:51:14,347
National sports pistol
champion at age 10...

577
00:51:14,382 --> 00:51:17,283
Olympic hopeful,
recruited by the army.

578
00:51:19,587 --> 00:51:20,554
- But after that, the kid is...
- Kisses, kisses, kisses.

579
00:51:20,621 --> 00:51:22,589
...never heard from again.

580
00:51:22,623 --> 00:51:25,490
Well, that sounds like Black Ops
got him, trained him.

581
00:51:25,526 --> 00:51:28,723
- This leads me to a theory.
- A theory?

582
00:51:28,763 --> 00:51:30,697
A theory is bull-noogies.

583
00:51:30,731 --> 00:51:34,428
All you got is a man with no name...

584
00:51:34,469 --> 00:51:37,267
ridin' into town on a pale horse...

585
00:51:37,305 --> 00:51:39,933
dispensin' his own brand o' justice.

586
00:52:11,272 --> 00:52:14,639
Hertz, you know why people
in this country love guns?

587
00:52:14,675 --> 00:52:16,802
And it's got nothin' to do
with all that...

588
00:52:16,844 --> 00:52:20,803
phallic mumbo jumbo,
like 'cockin' your gun.'

589
00:52:20,882 --> 00:52:23,112
No, Hertz, people love guns...

590
00:52:23,151 --> 00:52:27,144
because America
is a land of opportunity...

591
00:52:27,221 --> 00:52:29,849
where a poor man can become rich...

592
00:52:31,292 --> 00:52:34,318
...and a pussy can become
a tough guy...

593
00:52:34,362 --> 00:52:37,126
if he's got a gun in his hand.

594
00:52:39,667 --> 00:52:43,626
I'm hopin' you're not just
a pussy with a gun in your hand.

595
00:52:43,671 --> 00:52:46,834
Oh, no, sir, no. No, I'm not.

596
00:52:46,874 --> 00:52:49,604
I'm a tough guy with
a pussy in my hand.

597
00:52:54,749 --> 00:52:57,081
I want you to give this guy...

598
00:52:57,118 --> 00:53:00,019
and the kid a dirt nap.

599
00:53:00,121 --> 00:53:02,646
Yes, sir.

600
00:53:05,193 --> 00:53:06,785
Right away, sir.

601
00:53:09,197 --> 00:53:10,494
<i>Amore mio.</i>

602
00:53:12,166 --> 00:53:13,497
Don't worry.

603
00:53:13,534 --> 00:53:15,399
Daddy will be back soon.

604
00:53:33,888 --> 00:53:35,355
Hold it! Hold it!

605
00:53:39,193 --> 00:53:40,558
Well, well, well, Mr. Bunny.

606
00:53:40,595 --> 00:53:43,393
You just keep goin',
goin', goin', don't ya?

607
00:53:43,431 --> 00:53:46,491
- So do you.
- I promise to, uh...

608
00:53:46,534 --> 00:53:48,001
to spare your life
if you tell me where...

609
00:53:48,035 --> 00:53:49,468
the woman and child are.

610
00:53:49,503 --> 00:53:51,266
Forget it.

611
00:54:02,183 --> 00:54:04,481
Oh, boy.

612
00:54:04,518 --> 00:54:06,918
'Ey, who trained you?

613
00:54:06,954 --> 00:54:10,981
N.S.A. Black Ops? CIA?
The army?

614
00:54:11,025 --> 00:54:14,392
Well, whoever. It seems
you haven't lost your aim, champ.

615
00:54:14,729 --> 00:54:17,755
You think that's good, you should
see me spell my name in the snow.

616
00:54:21,269 --> 00:54:22,930
'Ey, you know, my boss here...

617
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:26,497
thinks that you're the lone Ranger
or something.

618
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:30,032
Well, I believe I have a better idea
about who you are.

619
00:54:31,345 --> 00:54:34,712
I found out how your
wife and son were killed.

620
00:54:34,749 --> 00:54:37,047
My God, what a tragedy.

621
00:54:37,084 --> 00:54:39,484
Some guy walks into a burger joint...

622
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,886
he starts shooting up the place.

623
00:54:41,922 --> 00:54:43,787
Oh, my God, what a shame...

624
00:54:43,824 --> 00:54:45,689
that your wife and son were there...

625
00:54:45,726 --> 00:54:49,218
having their... chicken nuggets.

626
00:54:55,403 --> 00:54:57,633
What's the matter,
ya don't like that story?

627
00:55:00,775 --> 00:55:02,902
Well, then why don't
ya tell me one, hm?

628
00:55:02,943 --> 00:55:05,309
Children's story, please.

629
00:55:08,249 --> 00:55:10,149
Tell me the one about the baby.

630
00:55:11,419 --> 00:55:13,284
Maybe later...

631
00:55:13,321 --> 00:55:14,788
when I put you to sleep.

632
00:55:19,193 --> 00:55:20,319
Go, go!

633
00:56:30,498 --> 00:56:32,489
So, what do you think
of this second amendment now?

634
00:56:32,933 --> 00:56:34,025
Fuck you!

635
00:56:35,469 --> 00:56:38,063
OK, buddy, drop your weapon.

636
00:56:48,816 --> 00:56:50,579
Think we got him?

637
00:57:14,675 --> 00:57:18,076
God damn it, Smith!

638
00:57:18,279 --> 00:57:20,213
So I found out
who's tryin' to kill our baby.

639
00:57:20,281 --> 00:57:22,340
- Who?
- A man named Hammerson.

640
00:57:23,484 --> 00:57:25,679
Born with a silver spoon up his ass.

641
00:57:25,719 --> 00:57:27,687
Inherited the Hammer
Firearms Corporation...

642
00:57:27,721 --> 00:57:30,588
from his old man and
makes millions manufacturing weapons.

643
00:57:30,624 --> 00:57:32,717
Does this give you any new ideas...

644
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:35,024
about who needs
Oliver's bone marrow?

645
00:57:35,062 --> 00:57:36,393
No.

646
00:57:37,164 --> 00:57:39,189
It's OK, little Oliver.

647
00:57:42,903 --> 00:57:45,565
Shit. It's him.

648
00:57:45,606 --> 00:57:48,404
Senator Rutledge.

649
00:57:48,442 --> 00:57:51,536
If he's elected president,
he'll put Hammerson out of business.

650
00:57:51,612 --> 00:57:53,637
It makes sense,
but how can you be sure?

651
00:57:53,714 --> 00:57:56,512
Mr. Go-To Guy called his men
a fine lot of babysitters.

652
00:57:56,550 --> 00:58:00,782
The secret service calls their agents
who guard VIPs babysitters.

653
00:58:00,821 --> 00:58:02,379
It's him, Senator Rutledge.

654
00:58:02,423 --> 00:58:03,981
He's the guy that needs this baby.

655
00:58:04,024 --> 00:58:06,959
So we contact this man
and then we're safe.

656
00:58:06,994 --> 00:58:08,757
- It's over.
- Are you crazy?

657
00:58:08,796 --> 00:58:10,093
This means that
we've got Hammerson...

658
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:12,394
and the whole of the U.S.
Government after us.

659
00:58:12,433 --> 00:58:14,060
I think you two have
gotta get out of town.

660
00:58:14,768 --> 00:58:16,565
Until I get the answers,
you'll never be safe.

661
00:58:16,604 --> 00:58:20,199
They'll be watchin' the trains,
the bus stations and the airports...

662
00:58:20,241 --> 00:58:22,709
So I think this is the safest
way to get out of town.

663
00:58:24,211 --> 00:58:26,236
I'm gonna check all of this out,
and if everything's OK...

664
00:58:26,313 --> 00:58:28,110
I'll get you
before you board the bus.

665
00:58:28,182 --> 00:58:31,583
But... What if you don't get
to us before we leave?

666
00:58:31,619 --> 00:58:33,416
Where should I get off?

667
00:58:34,522 --> 00:58:35,853
I think it's better if I don't know.

668
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:37,323
- What?
- Trust me.

669
00:58:38,592 --> 00:58:40,321
I can't know.

670
00:58:47,034 --> 00:58:49,764
Smith, do you really think
this is gonna work?

671
00:58:49,803 --> 00:58:53,000
Just stick to the plan
and everything will be all right.

672
00:58:54,341 --> 00:58:56,002
Run!

673
01:01:21,555 --> 01:01:23,887
So much for wearin' your seat belt.

674
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:52,015
What in the hell is that?

675
01:01:53,587 --> 01:01:56,613
Oh, my God, that is twisted.

676
01:01:56,657 --> 01:01:58,625
That sick son of a bitch.

677
01:01:59,493 --> 01:02:02,462
Oh, that sick son of a bitch
suckered us again!

678
01:02:07,668 --> 01:02:09,966
It's time to go, little boy.

679
01:02:13,907 --> 01:02:16,740
Put me through to whoever's
protecting Senator Rutledge.

680
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:21,547
Just tell him there's a man
with a baby calling.

681
01:02:24,118 --> 01:02:26,279
Hello, is this Smith?

682
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,914
That was a nice job coverin' up
your baby hatchery downtown.

683
01:02:28,956 --> 01:02:31,516
Not a word about it anywhere.

684
01:02:31,558 --> 01:02:33,924
Only you guys in Washington
have that kind of pull.

685
01:02:33,961 --> 01:02:36,759
I'm telling you,
we're on the same side.

686
01:02:36,797 --> 01:02:40,198
Now, listen, we can do this
the easy way or the hard way.

687
01:02:40,234 --> 01:02:41,724
I wanna see the senator.

688
01:02:43,337 --> 01:02:46,568
All right. He wants to see you too.

689
01:02:46,607 --> 01:02:49,735
He's leaving for North Carolina.
The primary's in three days.

690
01:02:49,777 --> 01:02:53,713
You can fly with him.
Runway 7, two hours.

691
01:02:53,747 --> 01:02:58,116
I see anythin' I don't like,
I'm blowin' this big time.

692
01:03:11,598 --> 01:03:12,724
What were you doing in there?

693
01:03:15,169 --> 01:03:18,468
- Cleaning my gun.
- Really?

694
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,899
You know, we were
never really trying to kill you.

695
01:03:21,942 --> 01:03:24,103
We only wanted to scare you
into surrendering.

696
01:03:24,144 --> 01:03:27,307
Well, that's one way to explain
why you can't shoot straight.

697
01:03:27,381 --> 01:03:28,939
In the latest poll,
Senator Rutledge...

698
01:03:29,016 --> 01:03:30,916
continues to be the
Democratic frontrunner...

699
01:03:30,951 --> 01:03:33,146
heading into next week's
Super Tuesday primary.

700
01:03:33,187 --> 01:03:35,621
He leads his rival by at least 10 points...

701
01:03:38,926 --> 01:03:40,018
I owe you my life.

702
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:42,255
So this is where you get to do
all those hookers.

703
01:03:44,765 --> 01:03:47,632
- I heard about you.
- You look worse than you do on TV.

704
01:03:47,668 --> 01:03:51,764
Yes, it's amazing
what a little makeup can do.

705
01:03:51,805 --> 01:03:53,500
And a lot of morphine.

706
01:03:56,844 --> 01:04:00,302
So, you've pieced
the whole thing together.

707
01:04:01,415 --> 01:04:04,316
Very clever, Mr. Smith.
Very clever.

708
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:06,080
Simple.

709
01:04:06,119 --> 01:04:08,087
You're the Democratic
frontrunner for president...

710
01:04:08,155 --> 01:04:10,419
and your sweeping
gun control proposals...

711
01:04:10,457 --> 01:04:13,290
are pissing the wrong people off.

712
01:04:13,327 --> 01:04:17,320
Yes, well, if they're pissed now,
wait until I'm elected president.

713
01:04:17,364 --> 01:04:18,797
We got so many goddamn...

714
01:04:18,832 --> 01:04:19,992
gun lobbies out there...

715
01:04:20,033 --> 01:04:22,831
that we're gonna have to set up
just as many commissions.

716
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:25,236
Then maybe we'll get our bill
passed in the first year.

717
01:04:25,272 --> 01:04:27,832
Unfortunately, you're sick
and the gun Nazis found out.

718
01:04:27,875 --> 01:04:31,675
They discovered your baby hatchery
and, boom, problem solved.

719
01:04:31,712 --> 01:04:35,113
- They kill you by killin' the babies.
- Correct.

720
01:04:35,816 --> 01:04:36,942
So, where's my savior?

721
01:04:38,485 --> 01:04:40,043
Oh, my God! Gun!

722
01:04:40,087 --> 01:04:43,022
Easy, easy.

723
01:04:43,056 --> 01:04:44,819
You know what I hate most?

724
01:04:44,858 --> 01:04:46,257
- liars.
- What the hell you doin'?

725
01:04:46,293 --> 01:04:47,726
You made a deal with Hammerson.

726
01:04:47,761 --> 01:04:48,921
- No, you're crazy.
- Am I?

727
01:04:48,962 --> 01:04:50,327
- Y...
- When you got into bed with him...

728
01:04:50,364 --> 01:04:52,195
you also let his dog up on the mattress.

729
01:04:52,232 --> 01:04:53,699
lookin' at those dog hairs
on your trousers...

730
01:04:53,734 --> 01:04:55,702
I'd say old Duchess took a likin' to you.

731
01:04:55,736 --> 01:04:57,033
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

732
01:04:57,070 --> 01:04:59,265
Save the line for when
you're in office, Rutledge.

733
01:04:59,306 --> 01:05:00,568
If he ever makes it there.

734
01:05:00,607 --> 01:05:02,234
Do you know what else I hate?

735
01:05:02,276 --> 01:05:03,834
Hypocrites.

736
01:05:03,877 --> 01:05:05,367
And you're the biggest one of all.

737
01:05:05,445 --> 01:05:07,470
Can you blame him
for sellin' out?

738
01:05:07,547 --> 01:05:09,777
His operation to find the baby...

739
01:05:09,850 --> 01:05:12,148
had been tits up from the get-go.

740
01:05:12,185 --> 01:05:14,449
You see, Rutledge called us
and he offered us...

741
01:05:14,488 --> 01:05:18,015
a proposition that we had
never dreamed was possible.

742
01:05:18,859 --> 01:05:20,087
In exchange for his life...

743
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:22,061
the senator promised
to protect our right...

744
01:05:22,095 --> 01:05:23,824
To go deer hunting with an Uzi.

745
01:05:23,864 --> 01:05:26,492
Oh, come on, Smith. Come on.

746
01:05:26,533 --> 01:05:28,091
Guns don't kill people.

747
01:05:28,135 --> 01:05:29,602
But they sure help.

748
01:05:30,671 --> 01:05:31,535
Back off!

749
01:05:31,571 --> 01:05:32,936
Back off.

750
01:05:32,973 --> 01:05:35,134
- Back off or I'll kill him!
- Oh, please.

751
01:05:35,175 --> 01:05:37,006
Pl... I had to do it.

752
01:05:37,044 --> 01:05:39,604
I want to live.
I am meant to be president.

753
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:42,615
Yeah? Well, you got what it takes.
You put yourself before the people.

754
01:05:42,649 --> 01:05:44,947
I can still do good in other areas.

755
01:05:44,985 --> 01:05:46,384
How you gonna square it
with the public?

756
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:49,150
It is a constitutional right.

757
01:05:49,189 --> 01:05:50,656
Back off! Get back!

758
01:05:50,691 --> 01:05:52,386
I've come around
to their way of thinking.

759
01:05:52,426 --> 01:05:54,656
Come around?
They had you at 'hello.'

760
01:05:55,929 --> 01:05:57,794
let me give you a piece of advice...

761
01:05:57,831 --> 01:06:00,493
Never trust the people who stand
to profit, plain and simple.

762
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:03,262
- They're the bad guys.
- Come on, Smith, don't be a fool.

763
01:06:03,303 --> 01:06:05,863
Go-to guy: The game is over.
You rolled the dice, you lost.

764
01:06:34,835 --> 01:06:36,928
let him go, Smith!
There's no escape!

765
01:06:36,970 --> 01:06:39,939
Maybe not for me, but there
is for the woman and baby.

766
01:06:39,973 --> 01:06:44,069
If I kill Rutledge, no one
will need to find them.

767
01:06:44,111 --> 01:06:45,840
They'll be saved.

768
01:06:45,912 --> 01:06:49,871
Your assassination, Rutledge,
will create a public outrage...

769
01:06:49,950 --> 01:06:52,817
and trigger immense support
for your proposals.

770
01:06:52,853 --> 01:06:56,289
The sympathy vote in the congress
will give your anti-gun bills...

771
01:06:56,356 --> 01:06:59,519
passage by a landslide.

772
01:06:59,559 --> 01:07:02,426
Your legacy... will live on.

773
01:07:02,529 --> 01:07:03,962
Don't do it!

774
01:07:04,931 --> 01:07:06,558
Then do it.

775
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:09,398
let me regain some honor
with my...

776
01:07:15,509 --> 01:07:17,477
That son of a bitch.

777
01:07:17,511 --> 01:07:18,910
Son of a bitch!

778
01:07:23,517 --> 01:07:25,314
God damn it!

779
01:09:33,046 --> 01:09:35,105
Don't move, Mr. Hero.

780
01:09:37,984 --> 01:09:39,645
Can't talk right now, honey.

781
01:09:39,686 --> 01:09:41,347
I'm right in the middle of somethin'.

782
01:09:41,388 --> 01:09:43,015
Bye-bye.

783
01:10:07,514 --> 01:10:09,709
Don't you worry, Duchess.

784
01:10:09,783 --> 01:10:11,910
This isn't gonna happen to you.

785
01:10:11,985 --> 01:10:14,146
Not for a few years, anyway.

786
01:10:15,355 --> 01:10:17,550
Well, well,
well, well, well.

787
01:10:19,326 --> 01:10:23,126
Somebody gets to be smart,
and somebody gets to be dumb.

788
01:10:23,163 --> 01:10:27,327
looks like you and I have
finally traded places, huh, sport?

789
01:10:29,002 --> 01:10:30,526
Yes, indeed.

790
01:10:31,605 --> 01:10:34,335
The circle of life.

791
01:10:34,374 --> 01:10:36,501
The circle-a jerk of life.

792
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:39,603
Oh, you have
such a way with words.

793
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:41,704
Now...

794
01:10:45,785 --> 01:10:48,583
I want you to tell me...

795
01:10:48,622 --> 01:10:51,420
where the woman
and the child are.

796
01:10:51,458 --> 01:10:54,052
Tell me, or I will be forced
to cause you...

797
01:10:54,094 --> 01:10:55,891
considerable agony.

798
01:10:55,929 --> 01:10:58,261
Believe me...

799
01:10:58,298 --> 01:11:01,825
nothing could be more painful than
listenin' to you jabberin' on and on.

800
01:11:06,906 --> 01:11:09,101
Again, I ask...

801
01:11:09,142 --> 01:11:10,803
where are the woman and child?

802
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:15,714
That's the last time
you'll be doin' that.

803
01:11:18,685 --> 01:11:20,516
Just tell me what I wanna hear.

804
01:11:20,553 --> 01:11:22,919
It's your choice
when the pain stops.

805
01:11:22,956 --> 01:11:25,322
Why are you doin' this?

806
01:11:25,358 --> 01:11:28,418
- It's over.
- It shortly will be, yeah.

807
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:32,798
No, I really should thank you.

808
01:11:32,832 --> 01:11:36,962
I just got a bigger contract
because of you.

809
01:11:37,003 --> 01:11:40,302
I mean, I wasn't just on
Hammerson's payroll, you know.

810
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:43,036
What are you babbling
on about now?

811
01:11:43,076 --> 01:11:46,011
Do you really think
the people that employ me...

812
01:11:46,079 --> 01:11:48,513
were just gonna bend over
and take your little stunt...

813
01:11:48,548 --> 01:11:49,776
killing the senator?

814
01:11:49,849 --> 01:11:52,181
There's no way that you can
cover up this whole thing.

815
01:11:52,218 --> 01:11:55,619
No? Haven't you heard
the news?

816
01:11:55,655 --> 01:11:57,987
The senator's plane
crashed into the East River.

817
01:11:58,024 --> 01:12:00,686
They haven't been able to find
the body of Senator Rutledge.

818
01:12:00,727 --> 01:12:02,820
So, you see, once I silence you
and the woman...

819
01:12:02,862 --> 01:12:04,762
the cover-up will be complete.

820
01:12:04,798 --> 01:12:07,096
So, once again, I ask you...

821
01:12:07,133 --> 01:12:08,896
where are the woman and child?

822
01:12:08,935 --> 01:12:10,869
You know how I'd break
your finger?

823
01:12:12,272 --> 01:12:13,534
My boy told me this one.

824
01:12:13,573 --> 01:12:14,767
You'd punch me in the nose.

825
01:12:14,808 --> 01:12:16,298
I'd kick you in the ass.

826
01:12:17,477 --> 01:12:19,342
Very amusing.

827
01:12:19,412 --> 01:12:22,472
I give that one the ol' thumbs up!

828
01:12:24,784 --> 01:12:26,684
What if you don't
get to us before we leave?

829
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:29,245
Oh, I know your whole story.

830
01:12:29,289 --> 01:12:32,315
That man who went
on the shooting spree in the restaurant.

831
01:12:32,359 --> 01:12:35,419
He visited the little gun shop
that you inherited from your dad.

832
01:12:35,462 --> 01:12:36,690
I found out how your wife
and son were killed.

833
01:12:36,730 --> 01:12:38,960
You sold him
the pair of shotguns...

834
01:12:38,998 --> 01:12:39,987
Shotguns.

835
01:12:40,033 --> 01:12:41,898
...that killed your own wife and boy.

836
01:12:42,802 --> 01:12:45,066
I'm not telling you...
a goddamn thing.

837
01:12:48,108 --> 01:12:50,804
Where are you, Smith?

838
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:55,280
Well, well, well, well, well.

839
01:12:55,315 --> 01:12:59,547
We're gonna need somethin'
a little more invasive.

840
01:13:14,734 --> 01:13:16,201
That's it.

841
01:13:37,524 --> 01:13:40,220
Aren't guns just fucking great,
Hammerson?

842
01:14:19,332 --> 01:14:20,629
'Ey.

843
01:14:20,667 --> 01:14:23,101
Who's a hotshot now, huh?

844
01:15:00,874 --> 01:15:01,932
Oh, yes, sirree, Bob.

845
01:15:01,975 --> 01:15:03,670
It certainly has been a pleasure.

846
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:05,575
But before we part ways...

847
01:15:05,612 --> 01:15:07,409
tell me one thing.

848
01:15:08,448 --> 01:15:10,541
I am dead on...

849
01:15:10,617 --> 01:15:12,710
about who you are, right?

850
01:15:12,785 --> 01:15:14,252
Say that again?

851
01:15:14,287 --> 01:15:16,152
I said, I am dead...

852
01:15:16,189 --> 01:15:17,588
Stop.

853
01:15:17,624 --> 01:15:19,751
That part of it you got right.

854
01:15:51,858 --> 01:15:52,984
It's the wife.

855
01:15:57,363 --> 01:15:59,263
Hi, honey.

856
01:16:03,436 --> 01:16:04,733
She's leaving me.

857
01:16:05,838 --> 01:16:07,635
You know what I really hate?

858
01:16:33,967 --> 01:16:35,559
What I really hate...

859
01:16:36,502 --> 01:16:38,993
...is a pussy with a gun in his hand.

860
01:17:20,380 --> 01:17:23,577
Investigators discovered
the body of Senator Rutledge today.

861
01:17:23,650 --> 01:17:27,313
The FBI stated an anonymous
tip led them to the remains.

862
01:17:54,647 --> 01:17:55,978
Don't worry, little boy.

863
01:17:56,015 --> 01:17:58,950
Mama will be watching you
while she's working.

864
01:18:16,002 --> 01:18:17,435
Oliver.

865
01:18:18,504 --> 01:18:20,131
Hello.

866
01:18:25,011 --> 01:18:26,569
What took you so long?

867
01:18:47,366 --> 01:18:48,890
All right, this is a robbery!

868
01:18:48,935 --> 01:18:50,994
Empty the drawer, all of it.

869
01:18:51,037 --> 01:18:52,402
Everyone else, freeze!

870
01:18:52,438 --> 01:18:54,838
Do it or I'll fucking blow your head off!

871
01:18:54,874 --> 01:18:56,501
He said freeze.

872
01:18:56,542 --> 01:18:58,635
That means don't even
pucker your butthole.

873
01:18:58,678 --> 01:19:00,908
That's right.
No puckering, nobody dies.

874
01:19:01,047 --> 01:19:02,139
So don't fuckin' move.

875
01:19:02,215 --> 01:19:04,183
We're kinda
in a rush here, man! Come on!

876
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:07,310
- You know what I hate?
- Shut up and sit on this, asshole.

877
01:19:07,353 --> 01:19:08,843
That's right! You heard him!
