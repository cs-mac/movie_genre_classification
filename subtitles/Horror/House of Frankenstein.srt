give me my chalk?

[Gagging]

3
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,570
Try that again
and I'll put you on
solitary confinement.

4
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,668
You would-be
Frankenstein.

5
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:30,045
Don't profane his name
with your dirty lips.

6
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:34,075
He was a genius in whose
footsteps I will follow
when I get out of here.

7
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,487
When you get out.
If I have anything
to say about it.

8
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,855
You'll
never get out.
But I will.

[Thunderclap]

10
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:49,366
Now. Friend Daniel.
Shall we go on with our work?

11
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,837
Now. This brain...

12
00:02:55,909 --> 00:03:00,209
is taken
from the man and transplanted
into the skull of the dog.

13
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,772
But given the mind
of a human being.

14
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:09,451
Now. Frankenstein would have
severed the spinal cord...

15
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:13,891
here.
But I'm not certain
that he was right.

16
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,487
Could Frankenstein have
made me like other men?

17
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:23,230
He gave life to a body
that he made from parts
of other bodies that had died.

18
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:27,000
Yes, Daniel, he could have
made you like other men.

19
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:31,339
Dr. Niemann. Did you know
Frankenstein?

20
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:35,973
No. But my brother,
who assisted him,
learned his secrets.

21
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:40,850
And before he died,
he passed them on to me.

22
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,447
Then... you could
give me a new body.

23
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:49,962
If I had Frankenstein's
records to guide me.

24
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:52,429
I could give you
a perfect body.

Well. Thank you.
Take the front wheel.
We'll take this.

May I offer you the warmth
of my living wagon?
[Niemann] Thank you.

36
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:57,755
So you're a merchant
that's been held for ransom
by mountain bandits.

37
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:01,851
For the better part of
three months.
And that's
your servant?

- Do you doubt me?
- It's a doubting world. Kind sir.

As I.
Professor Bruno Lampini.
Have reason to know.

40
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:13,905
I have a collection of the
world's most astounding horrors.

41
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,066
When I exhibit them,
what do I get?

42
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:19,168
Doubts, jeers,
cries of'Fake! Fake!"

43
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:23,181
You expect your patrons
to believe that the skeleton
you show them...

44
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:25,274
is really that
of Count Dracula?

45
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:28,377
I. Lampini. Took it...

46
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:32,288
pardon me... borrowed it
from the cellar
of Dracula's castle...

47
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:34,553
in the Carpathian Mountains.

48
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:38,324
With my own two hands
I spread upon the floor
of its coffin...

49
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,299
a layer of soil
taken from its birthplace.

50
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:44,768
So that by proxy.
Shall we say.

51
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:46,896
The skeleton of his
earthbound spirit might...

52
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:49,032
might lie at peace
within his grave.

53
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:53,442
Until the withdrawal
of the wooden stake
from its heart...

54
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,674
set Dracula free again...

55
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:59,741
to satisfy his unholy
appetite for blood.

56
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:03,311
At night. The giant bat
would seek its victims.

57
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:08,918
But before sunrise.
Return to the safety
of his coffin.

58
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:14,490
Aye, a single ray of sunlight
falling upon a vampire
would make him helpless.

59
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:20,495
Do you ever exhibit
your show in Visaria?

60
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:25,533
Visaria...
No. That's a town that
doesn't care for horrors.

61
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,273
They had one of their own
some 15 years ago...

62
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:32,306
when a Dr. Niemann tried
to give a dog the mind
of a human being.

63
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,319
They threw him
in prison...

64
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,787
because he.
Like Frankenstein.

65
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,723
Used bodies of the newly-dead
to carry on his work.

66
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:44,627
- Is old Hussman still alive?
- He's now the mayor
of Reigelberg.

67
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:48,258
Are you going there.
By any chance?
Later on in the season.

68
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:51,861
It's a small place.
Too far away to make
a trip profitable.

69
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:55,430
Nevertheless.
That is where you are going.

70
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:59,740
I am not going
to Reigelberg.

71
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:04,442
Then Daniel and I
will go alone.

72
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:13,054

Well. You seem worried.
Friend Daniel.

76
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:49,492
If they search
the ruins of the prison.
Our bodies will not be found.

77
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:53,828
We should hide.
And so we shall.
But in the open.

78
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,199
All the protection
of a traveling show.

Free to move on
toward those...

for whom I have
unloving memories.

who sent you to prison?

and old Hussman.
The burgomaster.

85
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,024
Yes. Friend Daniel.

86
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:29,329
We will travel
to the village of Reigelberg...

87
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:35,068
and pay our respects
to the burgomaster.

88
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:39,544
Your move. Inspector.
That's a neat trap
you've got me into.

89

Put it in the book.

He's here. Carl.
Yes.

91
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,855
As a man, I admire you.
As burgomaster,
I respect you.

92
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,687
But as a chess player.
Herr Hussman. I hate you.

93
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,320
Did you lose again.
Inspector?
[Laughs]

94
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:59,523
It serves you right.
I told you not
to play with him.

95
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:03,899
He always wins.
Don't you. You old darling?

96
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,133
I hope we're not breaking up
your game, but Carl
and I have decided...

00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,231
She means she has decided.

98
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:13,301

of the horror exhibit
down at the crossroads.

308
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:02,423
It's very late. Could we at
least rest here until tomorrow?

309
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:04,586
No. You've
got to move on.

310
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:10,699
All right. Daniel.
We'll move on.

311
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:17,097
Hand over the money
the villagers gave you.

312
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:19,735
Only your share.
All of it.

313
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:23,372
When I joined you. It was
agreed that I kept half.
Give me the money.

314
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:26,383
If you try to rob me.
I'll tell the police
that it's you...

315
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:28,442
who's been doing
the stealing!

316
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:31,079
I'll thrash you within
an inch of your life.

317
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:33,352
Let me go.
You smelly pig!

318
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,858
[Gasping]

319
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,424
[Screams]

320
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:43,263
No. Fejos!
No! No! No!

321
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:47,897
No, I say!
Fejos!

322
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,346
Daniel! Daniel!

323
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,473
Do you want to bring
the police on us?

324
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:00,608
Get him out of here
before he kills him.

325
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:09,054
Master. She's hurt.
May I take her with us?

326
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:11,925
No. We only have
tonight to search for
the Frankenstein records.

327
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:14,157
Please. Master.
She's hurt.

328
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:17,224
All right.
If it will keep you
in your right senses.

329
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:37,787
Are you awake?

330
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:40,221
You've nothing
to be afraid of.

331
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:48,959
Now I remember.
Who are you?

332
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:51,627
I'm Daniel.

333
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:54,672
I'm with
Professor Lampini's show.

334
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:57,640
Here. L...
I brought you some tea.

335
00:32:57,709 --> 00:33:02,112
It will make
you feel better.
That was nice of you.

336
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:09,119
Are you the one
that helped me?

337
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:12,645
It made me mad
when he whipped you.

338
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:15,784
But he can't hurt you anymore.
They've gone.

339
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:20,390
Leaving me a hundred miles
from nowhere.

340
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:24,663
No. But we're going to Visaria.
You can travel with us.

341
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:28,194
You can sleep here and...

342
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:30,866
talk to me when I drive.

343
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:35,038
I get so lonesome when
I have no one to talk to.

344
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:37,047
You don't know me
very well.

345
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:40,050
I might talk you
to death.

346
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:44,020
Your name's Ilonka.
Isn't it?

347
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:46,386
You know all about me.
Don't you. Daniel?

348
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:49,756
I watched you dance.
Did you?

349
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:54,055
Did you like me?

350
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:56,760
You're pretty.

351
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:03,200
You're afraid of me.
Aren't you?

352
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:05,469
Afraid of you?

353
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,704
If you weren't.

354
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:10,111
You'd come up here where
I could see you better.

355
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:35,067
But you will talk
to me sometimes?

356
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:40,677
Won't you?
Of course I will.

357
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,872
You've been
kind to me...

358
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,510
and I like you.

359
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:52,879
[Niemann]
Daniel. Daniel!
Yes. Master.

360
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:57,760
Come with me. I've found
a way into the ruins.

361
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:32,127
Master. If we find the
Frankenstein records.

362
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:34,130
Will you make me
like other men?

363
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:36,132
To please
your little gypsy girl.

364
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,966
Friend Daniel.
I'll make you an Adonis.

365
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,939
Here's a book.
Master!

366
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:52,949
Does it...

367
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:57,312
Help me, Master!

368
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:05,628
Daniel.
Are you hurt?
No. Master.

369
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:10,898
Evidently the force
of the flood...

370
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:14,233
burst through
that wall and...

371
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:17,797
washed everything
into the cave beyond.

372
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:21,470
We'd better look for
the records in there.

373
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,953
A glacial ice cavern.

374
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,526
[Niemann]
The Wolf Man.

375
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:13,621
Master.
Over there!

376
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,305
[Niemann]
The undying monster.

377
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:26,275
The triumphant climax
of Frankenstein's genius...

378
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:29,472
And the Wolf Man.

379
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:32,573
They may know where the
records are. Friend Daniel.

380
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,813
We'll set them free
and they will help us.

381
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,093
Master! Master!

382
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:58,968
Who are you?

383
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:02,494
Why have you freed me from
the ice that imprisoned
the beast within me?

384
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:06,805
Why?
Perhaps to help you.
Mr. Talbot.

385
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:10,938
No earthly power can help
those that are marked by
the sign of the pentagram.

386
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:14,041
You came here to ask
Frankenstein for help.
Didn't you?

387
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:16,348
Yes. But I
was too late.

388
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,912
He was dead.
I wanted to die too.

389
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:23,619
Nevertheless. When Dr. Mannering
trailed you here from England.

390
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:25,253
You asked him for help.

391
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:29,095
I did. But he became more
interested in the monster
than he was in me.

392
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:32,260
When the villagers
learned that he had brought
the monster back to life,

393
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:35,396
they blew up
the dam.
These frozen waters...

394
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:38,135
have held you here
all these years.

395
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:41,701
And now you've brought me
back to a life of misery.

396
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:45,510
With each full moon.
I turn into a werewolf.

397
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:49,041
I kill.

398
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,453
I want to die. Only death
can bring me release.

399
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:56,391
You don't have to die.
My boy. You're wrong.

400
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,394
I can help you.

401
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:02,597
How? How can
you help me?

402
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:05,965
I too am a doctor.
A scientist...

403
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:09,096
like Frankenstein.

404
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:12,608
Do you know where
he kept his records?

405
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:15,474
I think so.

406
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:19,710
Show me those records
and I'll build
a new brain for you.

407
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:23,550
I'll lift this curse
from you forever.

408
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:34,184
He wanted life
and strength.

409
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:37,455
I wanted
only death.

410
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:39,462
Here we are.

411
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:43,091
The answer to both
your problems lies here.

412
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:47,394
But in my laboratory
in Visaria.

413
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:50,440
I have the equipment
to restore his strength.

414
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:55,207
Then I must wait
until we reach Visaria.
You must be patient.

415
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:57,509
The horses are
harnessed. Master.

416
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:59,708
Can you drive?
Why. Yes.

417
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:02,217
Then take the road
to Visaria.

418
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:11,221
Master. Is he going
to drive all the time?

419
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:14,264
Yes.
I need you here.

420
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:18,458
We must apply
hot compresses.

421
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,699
The ice has seriously
damaged his tissues.

422
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:55,972
[Giggling]

423
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,702
What's the matter.
Daniel. You got bugs?

424
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,436
You're not Daniel.

425
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:05,539
No. Daniel's back
with the doctor.

426
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:09,245
Who are you?
Just the driver.

427
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,848
Are you going to
Visaria with us?
Yes.

428
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:17,485
I promised Daniel I'd keep
him company while he drove.

429
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:20,553
But I'll talk to you
if you want me to.

430
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:24,966
My name's Ilonka.
What's yours?

431
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:27,469
Lawrence.
Lawrence?

432
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:30,931
Do they call you
Larry?

433
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,040
They used to.

434
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,729
[Ilonka]
Larry! Larry!

435
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,958
I have
something for you.

436
00:43:58,168 --> 00:44:01,331
Look.
Pretty.

437
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:03,669
What's the matter
with you?

438
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:06,835
We've been together three days.
And you haven't smiled once.

439
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:11,206
I think I'd like you
better if you smiled.

440
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:14,079
Now don't start
barking at me.

441
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:17,245
There's a nice
big smile for you.

442
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,983
Now give me one.

443
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:22,389
You see how
easy it is.

444
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:24,552
Then why are you
always so sad?

445
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:27,722
I wish
you'd tell me.

446
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:29,732
Why?

447
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:32,902
Because I like you.

448
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:37,570
Tell me.
Maybe I can help.

449
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:42,806
No one
could help me.

450
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:52,548
[Niemann]
Daniel.

451
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:54,784
Hurry up with
that water.

452
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,849
You going to
stand there all day?

453
00:44:58,095 --> 00:45:00,063
Get started.

454
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:03,156
We've lost too
much time already.

455
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:15,006
Master. Why can't I
drive part of the time?

456
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:19,106
Talbot bothers me with
his everlasting impatience.

457
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:21,208
We must get the
monster to Visaria...

458
00:45:21,285 --> 00:45:24,812
before further changes make
restoration more difficult.

459
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:30,953
The desiccation of the tissues
has gone further than I thought.

460
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:41,687
It's not as
bad as I feared.

461
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:43,960
Our equipment
is still usable.

462
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:47,026
We must go to work
and get it in shape
as quickly as possible.

463
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:20,269
Turn on the steam.

464
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:31,209
Steam will soften
the tissues so that...

465
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:33,545
the high-frequency current
will go through them.

466
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:38,054
How long
will it take?
A day.
Perhaps longer.

467
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:40,112
Why must you
do that now?

468
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,215
You have everything
you need here.

469
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:44,658
Operate on me.

470
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:49,624
I've yet to find a way of combining
Frankenstein's technique with my own.

471
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,669
The moon will
be full tonight.
You know what that means.

472
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:55,864
I can't stand to go
through that torture again.
I tell you. I can't!

473
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:58,635
An operation now
would be a failure.

474
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:02,338
It would leave you exactly
as you are. You must wait.

475
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:04,744
Wait!

476
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,510
All right. Daniel.

477
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:16,885
Master. Talbot
is big and strong.
Will you give me...

478
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,895
Forget Talbot.
We have work to do.

479
00:48:19,963 --> 00:48:23,558
But. Master.
You promised...
All in due time. Daniel.

480
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:26,797
Tonight we call
on my old friends.

481
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:29,202
Ullman and Strauss.

482
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:54,723
Herr Strauss.
Yes.
What do you want?

483
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:58,825
Remember me?
I'm Dr. Niemann.

484
00:48:58,902 --> 00:49:03,168
Dr. Niemann?
Yes. Frederick.
Come with me.

485
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:08,034
Aaah!

486
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,045
Aaah!

487
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:36,064
Pardon me.
Herr Ullman.

488
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,471
Do you know
Herr Strauss?

489
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:40,976
The garrulous gentleman
who testified...

490
00:49:41,044 --> 00:49:44,275
that he saw me take
a body from its grave.

491
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:46,680
We don't forget.
Herr Strauss. Do we?

492
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:50,311
[Mumbling]
Oh. I'm sorry.

493
00:49:51,788 --> 00:49:54,450
Is that more
comfortable?

494
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:57,186
Niemann. I've saved
15.000 marks...

495
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:01,094
Since you testified
for the state to save
your miserable hide?

496
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:03,632
Let me go. Niemann. Let me
go and the money is yours.

497
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:07,693
Every bit of it.
15.000 marks.

498
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:09,705
A thousand for
every year...

499
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:14,210
that I spent in
the stinking. Slimy dungeon.

500
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:16,609
You bargain poorly.
Herr Ullman.

501
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,773
Don't kill me.
Don't kill me.

502
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,942
Kill my trusted
old assistant?

503
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,952
Why. No.

504
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,888
I'm going to repay you
for betraying me.

505
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:30,950
I'm going to give that
brain of yours a new home...

506
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:34,429
in the skull of the
Frankenstein monster.

507
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:38,800
As for you. Strauss.

508
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:42,270
I'm going to give you
the brain of the Wolf Man...

509
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:46,435
so that all your
waking hours will be
spent in untold agony.

510
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:50,503
Awaiting the
full of the moon,

511
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:53,777
which will change you
into a werewolf.

512
00:51:08,665 --> 00:51:12,032
The plasma must flow
at exactly that rate.

513
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:14,263
No more. No less.

514
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:17,238
If there's any change,
call me.

515
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,770
Master.
Yes?

516
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:26,907
Now that I've helped you
with Strauss and Ullman.

517
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:30,350
Will you give
Talbot's body to me?
What?

518
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,445
He's big.
He's strong.

519
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:36,891
Talbot's body is
the perfect home
for the monster's brain.

520
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,327
Which I will
add to and subtract
from in my experiments.

521
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:45,259
Master. You made
me a promise.
No!

522
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:47,496
You think I'd wreck
the work of a lifetime...

523
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:50,005
because you're in love
with a... a gypsy girl?

524
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:54,067
I've killed
four men for you.

525
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:57,443
Do as I say or
I'll never help you.

526
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:07,353
Larry!

527
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:09,392
Larry!

528
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:12,257
[Gasping]
Daniel. You frightened me.

529
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:14,422
Have you seen Larry?

530
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:18,762
What's the matter?
Don't you like Larry?

531
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:23,829
You used to smile
at me sometimes.
Before he joined us.

532
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:27,673
Why. Daniel.
I believe you're jealous.

533
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:30,645
You love him.
Don't you?

534
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:33,706
He's in some kind
of trouble. I think.

535
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:38,049
I want to help him.
You do love him.

536
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:40,282
But he
doesn't know it.

537
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:42,951
It wouldn't make
any difference to him
if he did.

538
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:47,429
Why not? Why wouldn't it
make any difference to him?

539
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:50,125
Do you see that?
It's a star.

540
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,567
A five-pointed star.
The pentagram.

541
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:54,729
The pentagram!

542
00:52:56,406 --> 00:52:58,704
The sign
of the beast.

543
00:52:58,775 --> 00:53:02,370
"Even a man who's
pure in heart...

544
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:04,675
and says his
prayers by night..."

545
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:07,114
"will become
a werewolf...

546
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:10,176
"when the
wolfbane blooms...

547
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:12,744
and the moon is
full and bright."

548
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:14,847
He's a werewolf.

549
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:16,893
Oh. No!

550
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,087
Not him.
Not Larry!

551
00:53:19,162 --> 00:53:22,131
You're lying!
You're lying to me!
No.

552
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,690
No. I'm trying to protect you.

553
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:26,998
Stay away from him.

554
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:30,528
When the moon is
full again. He'll turn.

555
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:32,541
And he'll kill.

556
00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:35,271
He'll kill.

557
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:37,336
I don't believe you.

558
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:40,315
You're making it all up
because you're jealous.

559
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:42,248
I hate you.

560
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:46,050
You're mean
and you're ugly!

561
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:48,682
I hate you!
I hate you!

562
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:51,488
I hate you!

563
00:54:05,275 --> 00:54:07,800
She hates me because
I'm an ugly hunchback.

564
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:11,836
If it wasn't for you.
I'd have Talbot's body.

565
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:23,311
Yes. Mrs. Strauss.
Yes. Yes. Mrs. Strauss.

566
00:55:23,386 --> 00:55:26,082
What about our beers.
Hoffman?
At once. Herr Burgomaster.

567
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,681
I must go now.
Mrs. Strauss.
Good day.

568
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,894
I don't know.
I don't know.

569
00:55:34,397 --> 00:55:37,093
The housewives ask me
where their husbands
are all the time.

570
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,226
What are you muttering
about. Hoffman?

571
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:41,668
Strauss hasn't been
home since yesterday.
His wife's very worried.

572
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:44,969
Sleeping off
a drunk probably.
I don't think so.

573
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:47,737
Why not?
Ullman hasn't been home
since last night either.

574
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:50,507
Neither has Braun.
The storekeeper.
That's odd.

575
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,605
When one man
doesn't come home.
You think nothing of it.

576
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,946
When three men disappear
overnight.

577
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,043
Particularly in
a small town like Visaria.

578
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,054
You begin to wonder.

579
00:55:59,122 --> 00:56:02,216
Inspector!
I found Herr Braun...

580
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:04,226
out in the woods.

581
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:07,593
He's dead.
Dead?

582
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,593
[Toberman]
What do you make
of it, Doctor?

583
00:56:12,669 --> 00:56:14,637
The juggler vein
is severed.

584
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:16,968
Not cut.
But torn apart...

585
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,531
as though by
powerful teeth.
A werewolf!

586
00:56:19,609 --> 00:56:21,543
We'll all
be murdered.

587
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:23,806
Heaven help us.
I must warn my
wife and children.

588
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,905
Schwartz. Meier.
Come back here.

589
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:28,109
I forbid that you
spread such talk.

590
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:32,086
What do you want to do?
Drive folks from Visaria and
ruin our village forever.

591
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:34,180
I'm ashamed of you.

592
00:56:34,257 --> 00:56:36,691
All of you. Believing in
such idiotic superstitions.

593
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,320
Then how do you
explain that?
And how about Strauss?

594
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:41,330
And Ullman.
What happened to them?

595
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:44,196
If there's a werewolf,
our people should know about it.

596
00:56:44,267 --> 00:56:46,292
I think so too.
Our children
aren't safe.

597
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:50,237
- If there's a werewolf.
Let's find him.
- Search for the werewolf!

598
00:56:50,306 --> 00:56:52,240
All right!
All right!

599
00:56:52,308 --> 00:56:54,435
Organize your
searching parties.

600
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:56,536
The inspector will
head one group.

601
00:56:56,613 --> 00:56:59,309
Schwartz another
and Meier. A third.
Find your werewolf.

602
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:25,440
"Even a man who
is pure at heart...

603
00:57:25,508 --> 00:57:28,500
and says his
prayers by night..."

604
00:57:28,578 --> 00:57:30,512
Then you know?

605
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:32,844
Daniel told me.

606
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:35,817
Oh. Larry.

607
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:38,285
Last night. I killed a man.

608
00:57:38,354 --> 00:57:41,949
You didn't know
what you were doing.
But I did.

609
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:45,358
I wanted to kill and
I knew that I wanted to.

610
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:49,990
Tonight the moon
will rise again...

611
00:57:50,066 --> 00:57:53,035
and I'll become that beast.

612
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:55,036
I'll kill again.

613
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:57,265
Can't Dr. Niemann
do anything for you?

614
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,638
Ask him. Larry.
Ask him.
Oh. He says...

615
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:02,837
that he can. But he
keeps putting me off.

616
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:05,210
I don't trust him.

617
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:08,512
I can't go on waiting
and killing and waiting.

618
00:58:08,585 --> 00:58:10,519
L...

619
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:14,546
I want forgetfulness. Peace.

620
00:58:14,624 --> 00:58:16,558
I want to help you.

621
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:19,993
I'll do anything.

622
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:22,463
When that spell
comes over me,

623
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:24,591
I'd kill anyone.

624
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:27,795
I won't let you.
I won't let you
out of my sight.

625
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:32,441
I might
even kill you.

626
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:35,342
I couldn't
help myself.

627
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:37,345
I'm not afraid.

628
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:50,258
It's no use.
Ilonka.

629
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:55,227
Only death can
bring us peace of mind.

630
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:00,765
And a werewolf
doesn't just die.

631
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:03,305
He must be killed.

632
00:59:05,508 --> 00:59:08,568
Killed by
a silver bullet.

633
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:13,174
Fired by
the hand of one...

634
00:59:13,249 --> 00:59:16,184
who loves him
enough...

635
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:18,516
to understand.

636
00:59:21,824 --> 00:59:26,158
[Larry's Voice]
He must be killed,
killed by a silver bullet.

637
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:33,865
[Ilonka]
Fired by the hand of someone...

638
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:36,269
who loves him enough...

639
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:38,500
to understand.

640
00:59:41,945 --> 00:59:44,140
Turbines.

641
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:48,540
[Niemann]
Now the generator.

[Generator Humming]

643
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:04,733
[Electricity Crackling]

644
01:00:34,864 --> 01:00:36,798
Check the mega-voltage.

645
01:00:36,866 --> 01:00:39,460
Twenty-five thousand.

646
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:43,528
Increase to 50.

647
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:48,302
The electronic bombardment
will penetrate...

648
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:50,312
Listen to me.
Niemann.

649
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:52,610
You promised that
if I found the
Frankenstein records.

650
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:54,650
You'd cure me
of this curse.

651
01:00:54,717 --> 01:00:56,742
I found them.
Gave them to you.

652
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:58,980
Now it's time for you
to keep your part
of the bargain.

653
01:00:59,055 --> 01:01:01,922
My boy. You must
have patience.
I've waited
long enough.

654
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:04,983
Last night I suffered
the tortures of the damned.

655
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:06,995
I killed a man.

656
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:09,395
Tonight the moon
will be full again.

657
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:12,525
Now you stop whatever you're
doing and operate on me...

658
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:15,662
or I swear I'll...

659
01:01:15,738 --> 01:01:19,071
Would you destroy your
only hope of release?

660
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:42,429
Well. Any sign of
your werewolf yet?

661
01:01:42,498 --> 01:01:44,898
We're early for him.
I guess.
Oh.

662
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:47,401
So he appears on schedule
like a train. Is that it?

663
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:49,495
[Electricity Crackling]

664
01:02:01,451 --> 01:02:04,113
Increase your mega-voltage
to a hundred thousand.

[Electricity Crackling]

666

Danger. Master!
Danger. Master!

01:02:18,768 --> 01:02:22,101
- Danger!
- Decrease!

669

Hello, Schwartz!
Come here quick!

670
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:00,170
[Muller]
What's the matter?
What is it?

671
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:02,336
Lights at
Dr. Niemann's.

672
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:05,039
Weird lights. Flashing
all over the old place.

673
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:08,743
At Dr. Niemann's?
Yeah, we saw them
from the road.

674
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:11,150
His place has been
closed for 15 years.

675
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:13,586
We better
investigate.

676
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:27,265
Larry.
Go away.

677
01:03:27,336 --> 01:03:29,668
No. Larry.
Let me in!

678
01:03:31,407 --> 01:03:33,398
Go away.
I tell you.

679
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:44,010
Tell Talbot
I'm ready for him.

01:05:00,296 --> 01:05:02,423
Aaah!

Aaah!

The Wolf Man.

685
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:53,337
The only thing
I ever loved.

686
01:06:56,612 --> 01:07:01,242
It wouldn't have happened if
you had kept faith with me.

687
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:04,718
I served you well.
Master.

688
01:07:04,787 --> 01:07:08,018
Remember Lampini?
Strauss?

689
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:11,548

going to join them.

Set fire to
the marsh grass.

Drive him back
into the bog.
