1
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,599
- Oh, I got it!
- No way! No way! No way!

2
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,015
Jeez, Susie,
you sure pack a load.

3
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,975
No, you asshole, you made me...

4
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,019
Duncan,
you're in the way, Duncan.

5
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:24,978
- Hey, Duncan.
- What?

6
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,190
<i>'Guys let s fne I "Go! p ay!</i>

7
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,196
Come on, guys, let him play.

8
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,700
- He'll help, anyway.
- Think of it as a challenge.

9
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,372
I don't know, fellows.
What do you think?

10
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,165
We're history as it is.

11
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,419
Duncan,
why don't you just keep score?

12
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,214
- I wanna lay back anyway.
- Okay.

13
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:47,217
Okay, let's see.
Where are we?

14
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,794
All right! Huddle up!

15
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:50,383
Okay, okay, on three!

16
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,430
One, two, three!
Break!

17
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:53,681
<i>Whoa-hoe'.!</i>

18
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:54,974
8-3 girls.

19
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,022
Got it!

20
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:01,974
Mine!

21
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:03,316
Got it!

22
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:10,865
Got it!

23
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,152
Ah!

24
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,953
<i>Yep'. Whoa'.!</i>

25
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:15,995
<i>Whoa'.!</i>

26
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,288
Look up!

27
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:19,746
Get it!

28
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,338
All right, all right, all right.

29
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,133
Jackie, let's be logical.

30
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,180
You can't stop your parents
from moving,

31
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,179
why don't you just
move in with us?

32
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:39,178
My mom wouldn't notice.
She's going through menopause.

33
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:41,396
I can't do that.

34
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,394
<i>Besides, since my mom
found my diaphragm,</i>

35
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,645
and I told her it was yours,

36
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,898
she thinks
you're a bad influence.

37
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:51,523
You got one year of school left,
Jackie.

38
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,992
Are your parents Nazis?

39
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,953
My mom's always working at her
job with the Washington Bureau,

40
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,782
and my dad, he says lawyers
can get jobs anywhere.

41
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:03,626
Got it!

42
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:04,919
Alright, alright,
right, right, right!

43
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,919
Jesus, Torn! What are you,
sabotaging us, huh?

44
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,546
Huh? They promised you
something? Yeah? Maybe? Hmm?

45
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,547
Jackie...

46
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,929
Do I detect an unnatural
interest in Frank Reedy?

47
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,679
Well?

48
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:26,768
Oh, talk to me when you stop
lusting after Michael.

49
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,403
He asked for it.

50
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,232
Just look at him,
flaunting that bod.

51
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,529
<i>Frank!</i>

52
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:40,747
It's no use. This is not
a good time to fall in love.

53
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,666
Hey, Jackie, how long has
that guy been sitting there?

54
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,585
<i>A while, I think.</i>

55
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,629
He looks weird.

56
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,002
Yo, buddy!
Keep your eyes to yourself!

57
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,964
Did you see that?
He averted his eyes.

58
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,515
That's a sign of submission.

59
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,138
I learned that studying
orangutans in biology class.

60
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:02,560
You're an orangutan,
Duncan.

61
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:03,887
I know what you're thinking,
you're thinking,

62
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,938
“A guy like that is just
the kind of guy we need

63
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,061
at the party tonight."

64
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,359
Duncan, it's a slumber party.

65
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,903
And no one wants
to slumber with you.

66
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,855
Slumber outside.

67
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:15,820
Eew!

68
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:22,285
Okay, I got it!

69
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,331
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

70
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:28,870
<i>I'll get it!</i>

71
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,381
So, what's it worth to you?

72
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,051
- You're Ken.
- Stop flirtin'! Come back!

73
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,474
<i>Ken Whitehouse. You went
to Maya Vista High, fight?</i>

74
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:41,891
That's right, and let's see,

75
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,845
you're Juliette,
Craig's little sister?

76
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,853
Go on without me, you guys!

77
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,521
Yeah, that's right.

78
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,398
Pleased to meet you, officially.

79
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,646
<i>- Alright, alright.
- Right.</i>

80
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,485
Sightseeing?
- I like what I see.

81
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,445
<i>- I got it! Here, out! Out!
- Out!</i>

82
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,045
- Where were you?
- You, too!

83
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,845
Jeez, Juliette.
If you didn't want him,

84
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,047
you could have at least
given us a chance.

85
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:22,348
For your information,

86
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:25,052
that was Ken Whitehouse,
of former water polo fame.

87
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,888
Are you kidding? And you
didn't bring him over here?

88
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,894
Well, he said he had to go talk
to his uncle or something.

89
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:31,733
But he said
he'd call me tonight.

90
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:32,809
I gave him your number.

91
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:36,147
Oh, great, Juliette. I'm glad my
mom pays to have it unlisted.

92
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,152
Don't you wanna give him
my number, too?

93
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,107
<i>Get outta here!</i>

94
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,659
<i>Oh, the weirdo's gone.</i>

95
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,243
What weirdo?
What's she talking about?

96
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,949
Uh, nobody.

97
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,745
All right, all right, all right.

98
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,412
Hold on a second, you guys.
I'll be right back.

99
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:54,214
- Hurry!
- Okay!

100
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,714
- Hurry up!
- All right!

101
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,499
Shit!

102
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:43,801
Shit.

103
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,567
<i>H'</i>

104
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:05,773
Thanks for the ride,

105
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,774
and I'm sorry I put you
so far out of your way.

106
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,529
Don't mention it.

107
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,779
Well... Bye.

108
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,543
Jackie?

109
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:32,341
Um... about last night...

110
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,769
I, uh... I wanna see you again.

111
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:39,064
Frank, I... I just don't want it
to be just another thing.

112
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,393
You know, that may be okay
for you, but it's not for me.

113
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:47,113
Hey, I don't want you
just for like a day or a week.

114
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,457
So you like me?

115
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,791
Yes, yes.
I like you. I like you.

116
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,259
So, call me.

117
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,172
All right.

118
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:39,786
Morgan.

119
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,035
<i>What are you doing
in the house?</i>

120
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:45,839
{Stammering}
Jackie, Jack, I, um...

121
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:49,422
I just got home.
And...

122
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:53,426
I saw your sign, and...
and the door was open.

123
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:59,178
And I thought you were having...
an open house.

124
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:03,523
It's okay, it's okay.

125
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,771
I just must have left
the door open.

126
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,816
My morn would kill me.

127
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,910
- Do you mind if I go by?
- Of course.

128
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,911
Of course not. No.

129
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:26,963
I'm, uh...
I'm just going to, um...

I'm... I'll just, uh...
I'm just gonna go.

131
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:36,848
No, no. Um...
Come on in. Take a look.

132
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,096
I didn't realize
you were in the market.

133
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,052
Oh, yes. Uh...

134
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:46,099
My accountant tells me I-
I have to buy something.

135
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,944
I have to buy something.

136
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,029
It's a nice house.

137
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,328
Why don't you just
look around yourself?

138
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:01,498
I mean, the layout's
really normal.

139
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,996
<i>The bedrooms, they're upstairs.</i>

140
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,961
<i>Hi, honey. I hope you're not
making a mess.</i>

141

<i>It's snowing here,</i>

142

<i>Anyone home?</i>

00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:32,446
Morgan! Do you want me
to show you around?

149
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,320
I... I looked... already.

150
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,951
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

151
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,030
No.

No.

No. No, thanks.

154
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,953
I think I'd better go.

00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,632

- Sorry.
- I couldn't.

- That's not all we brought.

[Laughing 1

163
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,024
So, put your stuff down.
What'd you bring?

164
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,977
Rum and vanilla ice cream.

165
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:56,904
And champagne, for the
more discriminating palate.

166
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,028
I don't know if anyone who wears
underwear in public

167
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,234
could be called discriminating,
Juliette!

168
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,820
And I brought brownies
with hot fudge sauce.

169
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,780
Well, didn't anybody bring
anything but dessert?

170
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,958
C'mon into the kitchen.
I got a barbecue going.

[Laughing 1

172
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,588
What are you making?

173
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,335
Chocolate-chocolate chip
cookies.

174
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,292
I saved some dough.
It's on the counter.

175
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,423
Oh, you are a friend.

176
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,930
You should've come to the beach.
It was great.

177
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,388
God, Janine,
you are disgusting.

178
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,344
Excuse me if I don't
beat the shit out of you.

179
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,305
Mmm...
I think I'm having an orgasm.

180
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:32,641
Am I missing something?

181
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,601
Oh, no more than usual.

182
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,570
Ooh!
What are you eating?

183
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,522
So, Miss Harlowe,

184
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:42,325
Can we expect a call from
your latest victim tonight?

185
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:43,617
Oh, he'll call.

186
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,570
Mm-hmm.

187
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,530
I'm gonna put these out back.
There's no room in the fridge.

188
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,295
Damn these things!

- Nope.

The coals are almost ready.

192
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:12,479
There's nothing else to do

193
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,183
until Sarah gets here
with the food.

194
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,898
Wow, this place is great.

195
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,738
God, I wish my parents
would go away for a while.

196
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:22,820
I know what you mean.

197
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,614
I love it when
my parents are gone.

198
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,033
Mine hardly ever go away.

199
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,789
There must be something
we can do

200
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,960
to take advantage of this.
Before they come home tomorrow.

201
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,629
I don't know. Your parents
are really nice, though, Jackie.

202
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,173
I mean, mine are so strict.

203
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,671
<i>They expect me to dress
like a little girl.</i>

204
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,633
I have to change my clothes
in the car every time

205
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,259
I leave the house.

206
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:48,216
I think you're really lucky.

207
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,638
- So you like your new job?
- Yeah, it's okay.

208
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,597
I make pretty good money
with the tips.

209
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,557
The food's good, and the
people are nice.

210
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,773
So, do you meet
anybody interesting?

211
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:03,065
Well, there was a guy
that came in last weekend,

212
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,572
I saw him looking at me, then he
started coming back every night.

213
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:07,948
Even the nights that
I wasn't working.

214
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,404
One of the other girls told me.

215
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,035
Last night, he comes up to me
and starts talking to me,

216
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,368
and we're going out,
tomorrow night!

217
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:15,952
What's he like?

218
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,955
Well, he's really nice
and really handsome.

219
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:22,463
He has dark eyes. Oh, God,
I just love older men!

220
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,010
They're such gentlemen!

221
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,884
- Well, how old is he?
- Oh, 50.

222
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,465
Maria!

223
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:32,056
It's cold out here. D'you think
we should still eat out here?

224
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,012
God, no way, it's freezing.
I'm gonna go back in.

225
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:35,971

Who's there?

00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:56,705
Oh, Puss. Silly Puss,
you out looking for mice again?

That shirt doesn't leave much
to the imagination, Maria.

233

Well, it's just us girls
tonight.

234

It looks amazing.

235

Well, here is to beer bellies.

236
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,455
And here's to beer thighs.

Susie, you know,
your hair looks really good

238

pulled back like that.

239
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,331
Really? I always thought

240
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,291
that I'd need big hair
to balance my hips.

241

Did somebody mention hips?
Here are the cookies.

Oh, no.

243
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,012
Susie, I thought
you were bringing Sarah.

244
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,761
I think she bagged, man.
Nobody answered at her house.

245
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,263

There goes the main course.

come by and see the house again.

At night. I...

256

I want to check out
the visibility from the roof.

The visibility?

258
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,589
For my telescope.
I track stars.

Morgan, I don't think so.
I have friends over.

Well, what did you
expect? Huh?

I would drive by

- and that's it. Not crash.
- Aw, c'mon, Frank.

all the way over here

Yeah, and take it like a man
why don't 'ya?

Now, what's going on with Frank?

495

I don't wanna talk

Oh, come on. I've got
to get my thrill somehow.

Well, we were getting together
to study, remember?

Oh, I knew I should have come.

Well, Tom didn't show up,
either.

That's suspicious.
Frank must have arranged this.

- You think so?
- Of course he did!

502
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:35,949
Now, what happened?

503
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:39,749
Well, we started to read
"Antony and Cleopatra“ aloud...

504

You know, we have that test
coming up next week.

506

And I get to the part in the end

507
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:46,593
where Cleopatra's
killing herself,

508
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:49,546
I don't know what happened, but
I just really got into it.

509
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,176
And I looked over at Frank,

510
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:54,851
and he was staring at me
with this intense expression.

511
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,018
Oh, God!

512
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,141
And I just couldn't think.

513
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,599
I felt like one of those animals
that gets mesmerized.

514
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:03,526
And then he took me,
and he leaned over,

515
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,145
and he started to kiss me.

516
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:07,773

this stupid?

518

It was the weirdo
from the beach.

529

He must have followed
one of us here.

He dropped something, Jackie.
I saw it fall outside.

to return it, do you?

00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,363
Life is short.

647
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:34,738
Can't argue with that.

648
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:43,834
God, I love this.

649
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:03,225
Oh, God.

650
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,904
What's wrong?

651
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:27,291
I think I drank
a little too much beer.

652
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,838
Ken, don't worry about it.

653
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,218
There's other ways
to make me happy.

654
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:58,738
You are crazy.

655
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,495
- Juliette will back me up.
- Uh-huh?

656
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,667
Does anybody know
where she is?

657
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:06,417
You might try a bedroom.

658
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:08,881
This calls
for some investigation.

659
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:12,210
Am I the only one
not getting it tonight?

660
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:15,133
I'm available.

661
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:16,385
Duncan!

662
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:30,194
<i>H'</i>

663
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,578
I don't think you've
had enough to eat.

664
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:50,256
What are you two smiling
like Cheshire cats for, huh?

665
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,083
I think I'm gonna get
something to eat.

666
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,759
What?

667
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,507
0h, my gosh!

668
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,009
- So?
- They're doing it!

669
00:45:58,214 --> 00:45:59,215
<i>Who? Juliette and Ken?</i>

670
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:00,804
Oh, this is great!

671
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:03,056
She doesn't deserve it!
I do!

672
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:04,729
Didn't they just meet today,
though?

673
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:08,058
Juliette has had her eye on Ken
since 9th grade.

674
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:10,064
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, God!

675
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:12,191
Get something to clean it up!

676
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:15,940
Oh, God!

677
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:17,616
I'm sorry.

678
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:18,696
It's okay, Susie.

679
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:21,529
Tom spilt pizza on the rug.

680
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,705
Ooh, let's get something
to fix that.

681
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,533
What should we use?

682
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:30,288
Bleach, you think?

683
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:32,043
Isn't that stuff kind of strong?

684
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:34,626
I don't know.
Do you want to try it?

685
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:37,053
What the hell?
We got to try something.

686
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:44,060
I'm gonna go take a shower,
so why don't you go downstairs

687
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:47,639
and tell them something?

688
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:49,895
Okay-

689
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,118
Juliette?

690
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:08,122
Go.
I'll see you downstairs.

691
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,346
What is it, catching?

692
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:31,607
<i>Poor GUYS-</i>

693
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:37,192
Jackie's gonna hear about this.

694
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:16,026
Ken?

695
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:24,113
You're one kinky guy.

696
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:48,885
Well?
How does it look?

697
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,269
Maybe we should blow-dry it.

698
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,942
We know how things look darker
when they're wet.

699
00:48:57,143 --> 00:48:59,817
<i>Hey, guys, I got one.
Here, in my bag.</i>

700
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:01,864
My mom's gonna kill me.

701
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,316
Sorry.

702
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:17,463
I got a bad feeling about this.

703
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,290
Doesn't look
like it can get much worse.

704
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:20,715
Ken!

705
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,884
- Back so soon?
- Huh?

706
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:25,346
We were just wondering
where Juliette was.

707
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:28,307
Oh, she just gave me a tour
of the whole house.

708
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:31,056
She stopped off in the bathroom.
Said she'd be down in a minute.

709
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,682
Uh-huh.

710
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:35,436
Excuse me, I think I have to go
powder my nose.

711
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:37,816
So, how is it coming
over there?

712
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,852
Oh, no.

713
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,061
I melted it.

714
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,783
Juliette!

715
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:52,824
Oh, Juliette!

716
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:20,150
Juliette! Jesus,
there's water everywhere!

717
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:38,877
What the hell was that?

718
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:39,670
It's Maria.

719
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,417
Juliette!

720
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:44,675
It's Juliette! She's...

721
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,127
Oh, God!

722
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:47,837
- Oh, my God!
- What do you mean?

723
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,217
She's dead!

724
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:50,889
- Where is she?
- In the closet!

725
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,051
- What happened?
- Maria, are you okay?

726
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:54,931
Wait here.

727
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:07,781
- What happened?
- Is she okay?

728
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:09,696
She was murdered.

729
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,698
Wait!
What are you talking about?

730
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:12,949
She could have slipped
or something!

731
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:15,781
She's stuffed in a garment bag
in a closet!

732
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:19,748
We've gotta call the police.

733
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,754
What if whoever did this
is still in the house?

734
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,627
Ken, where was she
when you left her?

735
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:26,175
Jackie!

736
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:28,093
She was gonna take a shower.

737
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:30,797
We had just...

738
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:32,973
Jackie, leave him alone.

739
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,016
Maybe it was that weird guy
who did it.

740
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:36,932
Maybe he was the one
that took the lightbulb.

741
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,017
- What?
- What Iightbulb?

742
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,222
<i>We thought Michael took it.</i>

743
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:42,524
Gosh! Michael!

744
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:45,148
Ken, you and Dunc,
stay with the girls, okay?

745
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:47,354
Tom and I will
take a look around.

746
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:49,657
Susie's right!
He could still be in the house!

747
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:51,154
We should all leave!

748
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,406
But what if he's outside?

749
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:56,114
We should call the police.
Isn't there a phone up here?

750
00:51:56,322 --> 00:51:59,075
They're not gonna listen to me!
They think I'm playing a joke!

751
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:01,411
I'll call. They'll listen.

752
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,667
If they won't help,
I'll call my uncle.

753
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,215
He's an ex-cop.

754
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:09,126
Alright, Jackie, we found
an open window.

755
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:10,928
But there's really
no way to get in.

756
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:13,548
Yeah, we also found a phone
that was ripped out of the wall.

757
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:15,099
But, guys, can we
just go downstairs

758
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:16,972
and call the cops, please?

759
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:18,476
<i>Yes.</i>

760
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:20,095
Let's go.

761
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,699
Jackie, stay by me,
in case they have any questions.

762
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:36,699
Playa Vista Police.
This is O'Reilly.

763
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:39,282
Yes, I'd like
to report a murder.

764
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:40,491
<i>A young woman.</i>

765
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,373
A woman...
A woman named Juliette.

766
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:44,829
<i>Who is this?</i>

767
00:52:45,037 --> 00:52:46,289
Hello?
This is Jackie Cassidy.

768
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:48,006
I called earlier.

769
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:49,129
<i>You're still at it, huh?</i>

770
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:51,552
No! You've got to listen to me!
There's been a murder.

771
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:53,174
<i>It's one of my friends,
Juliette.</i>

772
00:52:53,379 --> 00:52:54,722
Jeez, these kids never give up.

773
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:56,469
<i>And my other friends
went to look for her,</i>

774
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:58,142
and they found her
stuffed in a garment bag!

775
00:52:58,342 --> 00:52:59,844
<i>You girls
having a good time?</i>

776
00:53:00,052 --> 00:53:01,929
No!
You've got to come over here!

777
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:04,682
It's your responsibility
to check out these calls!

778
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,563
No, you misunderstand.

779
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:10,192
My job is to weed out the real
calls from the prank calls.

780
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:12,490
Now, if you have any respect
for the taxpayers' money

781
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,863
and the people out there
who really need our help,

782
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:17,490
you'll cut this shit out
and stop tying up the phone.

783
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:19,618
Another one, huh?

784
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:22,291
Ah, the same one.
Stupid kids.

785
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:25,160
You ever feel you
might be wrong?

786
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:27,167
You know, ignore a call from
someone

787
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:28,714
who might really need help?

788
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,632
You wanna answer
this fuckin' phone?

789
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:32,255
'Cause I don't need this shit.

790
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:33,631
I didn't mean anything by it.

791
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:35,463
It's just that it
occurred to me, that's all.

792
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:38,390
You tryin' to ruin my day?
Shit.

793
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:40,350
Tell you what I'll do.

794
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:43,600
I'll swing by there in about an
hour, when I get off my shift,

795
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:46,557
and that way, neither one of us
will have to worry about it.

796
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:48,642
Got the address?

797
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:51,903
Thanks.

798
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:54,194
We're in deep shit.

799
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:56,651
Why don't I go get my uncle?

800
00:53:56,859 --> 00:53:59,408
Look, man, no offense, but
you're not really in any shape.

801
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:01,409
I'm fine, and I'm fast.
I used to be a sprinter.

802
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,536
I want to get out of this house.
I want to do it for Juliette.

803
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:05,334
Why don't you just
call your uncle?

804
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:07,252
He's asleep by now.
He'd never hear the phone.

805
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:08,412
Maybe... maybe you should.

806
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:10,047
We have to do something.

807
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:11,707
All right. Do it.

808
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,792
But take something with you,
all right?

809
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:15,469
Hey, I'm going with you!

810
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:16,795
Come on!

811
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:18,506
- All right. Take it.
- Thanks.

812
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:21,054
- Let's go.
- You're too generous.

813
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:25,437
- Ready?
- Yeah.

814
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:36,858
<i>H'</i>

815
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:46,625
Ah! Shit!

816
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:48,077
What's the matter?
Are you okay?

817
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,377
Yeah.

818
00:54:49,578 --> 00:54:50,545
Not really.

819
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:52,164
Oh, I can't run anymore.

820
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:53,589
Come on.
I'll go as fast as I can.

821
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:55,134
It's just a block down
and a block over.

822
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:57,257
If you wanna run on ahead,
I'll tell you which house it is.

823
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:58,921
No, that's okay.

824
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:00,510
What's wrong with your leg?

825
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,261
Oh, it's an old injury.
My knee's messed up.

826
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:03,391
Usually it's okay.

827
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:04,514
Dammit!

828
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,891
Yeah, yeah. My ankle
gets weird on me sometimes.

829
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:08,847
Achilles tendon.

830
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:09,978
Ugh!

831
00:55:10,182 --> 00:55:11,559
Hey, is this
the old lumber yard?

832
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,398
I know where they keep
their tools in here.

833
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:15,987
Do you want it?

834
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:18,532
I sure don't want to be fighting
somebody off with this thing.

835
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:20,234
Let's do it.

836
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:43,553
They got some
major stuff in here.

837
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:53,476
I ain't carrying that
all the way back with me.

838
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:55,151
Yeah, we got to find
something smaller.

839
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:57,070
Go see what's on the shelves.

840
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,964
Yeah, this is more like it.

841
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,093
Yeah, let me see
that sledgehammer.

842
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:23,051
It's perfect.

843
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:26,592
That's what you get!

844
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,392
Oh, shit!

845
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:29,937
What are you doing?

846
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:31,980
Get the hell off me!
You crazy?

847
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:34,975
What kind of question is that?

848
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:36,651
Get off of me!

849
00:57:02,294 --> 00:57:04,717
Nothing wrong
with my knees, boy!

850
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:50,718
Never, ever admit
your weaknesses.

851
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:38,105
How long has it been?

852
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:40,058
Ten minutes, at least.

853
00:58:42,144 --> 00:58:43,896
The rug looks like shit.

854
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:46,941
God, I feel like I'm in
a concentration camp

855
00:58:47,149 --> 00:58:48,822
waiting for the Gestapo
to come in and say,

856
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:51,404
"You, Diane, you're next."

857
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:52,696
All the windows
and doors are locked.

858
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:55,578
Nobody should be able
to get in.

859
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:58,752
What about through the basement?

860
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:00,750
Oh, my God, the basement!
I forgot!

861
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,456
There's a window in there!
Give me that poker!

862
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:04,132
Jackie, you're not
going down there!

863
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:05,629
- Besides, they're tongs.
- Give it to me!

864
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:06,881
Come on, Jackie.
Sit down.

865
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:07,677
Don't tell me what to do!

866
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:08,925
All right, all right, all right.

867
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:11,097
Let me get a knife
and come with you, okay?

868
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:12,804
Okay-

869
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:57,014
Hey! Nice fish!

870
00:59:57,511 --> 00:59:58,854
Forget the fish.

871
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:01,603
We've solved the mystery
how that guy got in here.

872
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:07,650
Here.

873
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:17,538
Jeez.

874
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:20,538
What in the hell
does my dad keep in here?

875
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:27,670
Come on. Come on.

876
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:31,302
The weirdo's
down in the basement!

877
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:32,800
- What?
- And the window was open!

878
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:33,846
It still is.

879
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:35,970
I can't believe that somebody
killed the weirdo and Juliette!

880
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:37,346
Where the hell are Ken
and Tom?

881
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:38,177
What is taking them?

882
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:41,184
Everybody, listen. Did anything
else strange happen tonight?

883
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:42,389
My neighbor called!

884
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:43,268
What neighbor?

885
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,066
This guy that lives
across the street!

886
01:00:45,517 --> 01:00:46,734
- Another weird guy?
- Yes!

887
01:00:47,269 --> 01:00:48,236
He lives across the street!

888
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:50,689
And he was in the house
when I got home today.

889
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:51,568
What?

890
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:52,649
- What?
- What?

891
01:00:52,858 --> 01:00:54,781
Well, he told me, he said
it was an open house,

892
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:56,202
and then... and then
he called tonight

893
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:58,030
and he asked if he could see
the house at night.

894
01:00:58,238 --> 01:01:00,161
Jesus Christ, Jackie!

895
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:04,036
I'll get it.
Somebody, go with me.

896
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:08,794
Hello?

897
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:10,842
<i>- Hello? Who is this?
- Ken'?</i>

898
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:12,715
Jackie?
You sounded funny.

899
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,171
Listen. My uncle said

900
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:16,131
<i>it's definitely safer
to stay in the house.</i>

901
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:17,511
<i>The guy probably
didn't stick around.</i>

902
01:01:17,716 --> 01:01:20,310
We'll be over in a few minutes
to check it out, okay?

903
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,478
Tom went to try to persuade
the police in person.

904
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,352
I told him to meet me
in 10 minutes here.

905
01:01:24,556 --> 01:01:27,400
<i>Until then,
please stay where you are.</i>

906
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:33,273
So, who was it?

907
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:34,240
It was Ken.

908
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:35,442
He said he'd be here
in 10 minutes,

909
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,118
and he wants us to wait
right here.

910
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:38,696
I hope he has his uncle
with him.

911
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:47,014
Uncle?

912
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:49,604
This is for you!

913
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,052
I can't stand this.

914
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:26,511
It's been 10 minutes already.

915
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,557
It's him.

916
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:54,506
<i>Hello, police?</i>

917
01:03:54,706 --> 01:03:58,756
<i>This is Doctor Hurt Nanette,
395 Edgewood...</i>

918
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,088
I'd like to report
a disturbance.

919
01:04:01,296 --> 01:04:04,015
<i>Yes, sir, yes, sir, we'll have
somebody out there right away.</i>

920
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:08,891
<i>Don't go out there!</i>

921
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:12,895
Aaah!

922
01:04:43,088 --> 01:04:44,931
You killed him!

923
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:02,066
<i>Girls!</i>

924
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:04,150
Was it something I said?

925
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:10,115
Jackie, this way!

926
01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:11,203
<i>Okay, okay!</i>

927
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:13,330
<i>Ya“!</i>

928
01:05:13,535 --> 01:05:14,787
Aahh!

929
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,247
Help!

930
01:05:19,124 --> 01:05:19,795
Help!

931
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:21,217
- Come on!
- Wait!

932
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:23,967
I can't get it open!
Shit!

933
01:05:24,212 --> 01:05:25,179
He's coming!

934
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:27,303
Oh, my God!

935
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:30,511
<i>I can't get it open!</i>

936
01:05:30,718 --> 01:05:31,594
<i>He's coming!</i>

937
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:34,522
Be nice to Uncle, girls!

938
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:43,114
Alone at last, huh, Maria?

939
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:45,154
Oh, God.

940
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,156
Please, no.

941
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,987
Please, Ken.

942
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:51,163
Do as I say!

943
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:57,870
Aahhh!

944
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,048
Open it!

945
01:06:01,249 --> 01:06:03,126
<i>Please, help me!</i>

946
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:21,561
Come on.

947
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:41,248
You're not being nice!

948
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:43,041
Fuck you!

949
01:06:52,467 --> 01:06:54,219
What a waste.

950
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:25,633
We've got to get help.

951
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:28,302
Jackie, I can't jump,
it's too high.

952
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:30,968
I'll fall, and he'll get me.

953
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:32,640
Then, the only way out
is the basement,

954
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,342
'cause he's watching
all the doors.

955
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:35,973
Can you at least walk?

956
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:39,181
- Yeah. Yeah, I can.
- Okay.

957
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:05,215
Uncle Billy has something
for you.

958
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:08,297
<i>Come and get it.</i>

959
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,904
You can't keep me out!

960
01:09:21,491 --> 01:09:22,993
You ready?

961
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:26,204
Let's go.

962
01:09:53,314 --> 01:09:54,816
<i>Juliette?</i>

963
01:10:03,574 --> 01:10:05,918
Juliette?

964
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:11,916
You did this!

965
01:10:14,836 --> 01:10:16,133
He's got somebody.

966
01:10:16,337 --> 01:10:16,883
Wait, Jackie!

967
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:21,801
Oh, God!

968
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:23,101
Ahhhh!

969
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:24,599
No!

970
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:32,695
No!

971
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:35,190
No!

972
01:10:36,524 --> 01:10:37,946
Why?

973
01:10:38,151 --> 01:10:39,277
Why?

974
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:41,947
Fight the fight!

975
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:54,796
<i>You were jealous, weren't you?</i>

976
01:11:00,715 --> 01:11:02,968
Look at me!
Look at me!

977
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:04,803
You were jealous, weren't you?

978
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:10,024
You have to be jealous.

979
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:12,735
I'm your uncle, huh?

980
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:16,189
I'll always love you.
I'll always love you!

981
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:40,346
He's got Susie!
He's got her!

982
01:11:40,588 --> 01:11:41,339
Come on!

983
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:49,563
<i>We can play this game,
if you want!</i>

984
01:11:51,933 --> 01:11:53,150
Come back!

985
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:07,369
Okay, somebody,
help me with this!

986
01:12:07,615 --> 01:12:09,117
Help me with this!

987
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,878
Get up there!
Hurry up! Get up there!

988
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:14,334
Ow.

989
01:12:14,539 --> 01:12:15,540
You go through and pull
from the top.

990
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,338
Go. Go. Get up there, go!

991
01:12:18,543 --> 01:12:20,216
- Go, Maria.
- Go. Maria!

992
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:22,467
- I can't do it.
- Go!

993
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:25,341
- Maria.
- Go!

994
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:28,094
I can't, it hurts...

995
01:12:29,387 --> 01:12:30,354
Go!

996
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:32,106
Go!

997
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:56,046
Aahh!

998
01:12:56,747 --> 01:12:57,794
Aahhh!

999
01:12:58,499 --> 01:12:59,466
Oh!

1000
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:00,843
Oh!

1001
01:13:34,619 --> 01:13:36,212
Get the drill!

1002
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:40,336
Get the drill!

1003
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,176
Get the drill!

1004
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:43,878
Aahh!

1005
01:14:11,197 --> 01:14:13,450
Ken, stop!
Please, stop!

1006
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:14,621
Remember when you said

1007
01:14:15,076 --> 01:14:16,703
you wouldn't hurt me
if I didn't move?

1008
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:18,709
Well, you did!
You kept your promise!

1009
01:14:18,913 --> 01:14:20,665
I'm sorry I didn't
believe you, Ken.

1010
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:22,625
I'm sorry we all hurt you.

1011
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:24,176
I know you don't want
to hurt me,

1012
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:25,845
you just want me to do
what you say.

1013
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:29,766
I will... listen to you, Ken.
I'll do exactly what you want.

1014
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:31,558
Ken...

1015
01:14:31,759 --> 01:14:34,638
I know somebody did something
really awful to you,

1016
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:35,854
but it wasn't me, Ken.

1017
01:14:36,055 --> 01:14:37,477
You hardly know me.

1018
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:40,231
But if I said something to you
that made you angry, I'm sorry.

1019
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:42,436
I take it all back, really,
I do.

1020
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:46,449
Just, please don't
hurt me anymore. Please.

1021
01:14:48,359 --> 01:14:49,986
Maria?

1022
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:55,871
You can talk to me about it.

1023
01:14:56,951 --> 01:15:02,924
I'll listen. I swear, I'll stay
right here with you and listen.

1024
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:08,297
Was it your parents?
Is that what it was?

1025
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:11,720
No.

1026
01:15:13,884 --> 01:15:17,309
Was it a girl?
Is that it?

1027
01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:19,561
No.

1028
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:26,148
You can touch me,
if that's what you want.

1029
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:28,816
Go ahead.

1030
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:35,411
You can do whatever you want.

1031
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,453
I can do whatever I want?

1032
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:45,799
Yes. That's right.

1033
01:16:43,724 --> 01:16:45,476
Oh, yes, Ken.

1034
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:49,438
Oh, yes.

1035
01:16:51,732 --> 01:16:54,736
Oh, yes.
Touch me, please.

1036
01:16:54,944 --> 01:16:55,365
Oh, yeah.

1037
01:16:55,569 --> 01:16:57,287
Stop it! Stop it!

1038
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:03,247
Aahhhh!

1039
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:40,869
Where the fuck are you?

1040
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:55,179
I don't wanna
play this game anymore!

1041
01:17:56,463 --> 01:17:58,136
Come around.

1042
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:05,648
Now are you at almost?

1043
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:09,818
Oh!

1044
01:18:11,145 --> 01:18:13,318
A little heavy-footed there,
huh?

1045
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:41,509

"Yes- yes!

1050
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:09,378
I don't want to do this.

01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:19,296
Hey.

1052
01:19:19,797 --> 01:19:20,639
Hey.

1053
01:19:20,839 --> 01:19:21,931
Make another noise.

Get the net!

I'm gonna call the police.

1067
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,997
They have to listen this time.

1068
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:38,421
Let's just kill him,
and then he'll never get away.

1069
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:40,089
We can't just kill him!

1070
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:41,253
Why not?

1071
01:20:41,462 --> 01:20:43,305
Because you don't kill somebody
that's just lying there!

1072
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:45,553
Guys, excuse me.
We don't have all night.

1073
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:47,434
What are we gonna do with him?

1074
01:20:50,721 --> 01:20:51,563

I'm gonna get a knife
from the kitchen.

1078

I'm your uncle.
I'll always love you.

1079

Uncle Billy has something
for you.

1080
01:21:12,659 --> 01:21:13,911
- Shit!
- What's wrong?

1081
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:15,128
He pulled that phone out, too.

1082
01:21:16,246 --> 01:21:17,372
<i>He's kind of breathing funny.</i>

1083

<i>Well, you hit him
over the head a lot.</i>
