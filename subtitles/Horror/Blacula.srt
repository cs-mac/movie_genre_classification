1
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:45,029
I've never before had the opportunity
of entertaining personages

2
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:48,082
from the... 'dark continent'.

3
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:52,870
I hope the reception was not boring
for you and your lovely wife.

4
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,164
Quite the contrary, Count Dracula.

5
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:57,083
The evening has been a splendid one,

6
00:00:57,183 --> 00:01:01,379
and we've found your guests
to be most impressive.

7
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:04,674
I liked in particular
your Dr Duvalier.

8
00:01:04,774 --> 00:01:06,217
It was you who impressed him.

9
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:10,763
Mamuwalde is the crystallisation
of our people's pride.

10
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:13,357
My Luva... she does
me too much credit.

11
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:16,769
But notwithstanding,
my people are eager

12
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:19,863
to bring our ancient culture
into the community of nations.

13
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:23,567
That may take a good deal of time.

14
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:26,529
It will at least be time well spent,

15
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:29,865
as opposed to an
exchange of banalities

16
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:32,751
with pseudo-intellectuals
and dilettantes.

17
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:34,745
Charming.

18
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:37,456
What with dignitaries of your stature

19
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,500
lending the weight of
your statesmanship

20
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,836
to the fulfillment of our objectives,

21
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:44,096
I believe we will succeed.

22
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,015
Luva?

23
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:59,069
To totally cease the slave trade?
I find that unrealistic.

24
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,823
Slavery has merit, I believe.

25
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,568
Merit?

26
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:08,829
You find merit in barbarity?

27
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:12,708
Barbarous from the standpoint
of the slave, perhaps.

28
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:15,745
Intriguing and delightful from mine.

29
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:19,923
I would pay for so beautiful an addition
to my household as your delicious wife.

30
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:22,468
Sir, are you ill?

31
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:26,805
Oh... I meant no insult, prince.

32
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:30,134
It is a compliment for
a man of my station

33
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:33,645
to look with desire on
one of your colour.

34
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:37,441
Sir, I suddenly find
your cognac as...

35
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:40,611
distasteful as your manner.

36
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,822
You're behaving like some animal.

37
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,533
- Really?
- Really.

38
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,195
Let us not forget, sir,

39
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:51,538
it is you who comes from the jungle.

40
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,617
Our evening is finished.

41
00:02:54,717 --> 00:02:58,128
I bid you arouse your coachman.
We are leaving.

42
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:00,547
I do not think so.

43
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:04,802
How dare you!

44
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:14,603
Let me go!

45
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:45,884
Look out! No!

46
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:37,227
You shall pay, black prince.

47
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:42,099
I shall place a curse
of suffering on you

48
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:45,110
that will doom you to a living hell.

49
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:47,229
A hunger,

50
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:51,525
a wild, gnawing, animal hunger

51
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,235
will grow in you,

52
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:56,747
a hunger for human blood.

53
00:04:57,047 --> 00:05:00,951
Here you will starve for an eternity,

54
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:04,330
torn by an unquenchable lust.

55
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:09,210
I curse you with my name.

56
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,720
You shall be...

57
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,840
Blacula!

58
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,052
A vampire like myself,

59
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:19,803
a living fiend,

60
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,306
you will be doomed

61
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:27,353
never to know that sweet blood

62
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:31,565
which will become your only...

63
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:32,816
desire.

64
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,752
No!

65
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:45,579
You will watch,

66
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:49,041
helpless and dying,

67
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:53,262
until the black flesh
rots from your bones.

68
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:58,308
Listen... for his cries.

69
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:02,805
They will comfort you

70
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:05,190
until your death.

71
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:26,120
No!

72
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,122
Let me out!

73
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,042
Help. Oh, help.

74
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,094
Mamuwalde.

75
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,768
Dracula?

76
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:31,388
But he is dead, gentlemen.
Quite dead.

77
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,932
He and his entire
household were destroyed

78
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:38,395
by the great Dr Van Helsing
almost 150 years ago.

79
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:42,491
Oh, what a pity.
I've never met a vampire.

80
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:46,028
You should have told us whose
house this was in the village.

81
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:48,113
Yeah, honey, now, wait.

82
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,574
This is gonna change
our deal drastically.

83
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:51,825
Oh, I see.

84
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:55,078
Well, I can assure you,
gentlemen, it is quite safe now.

85
00:09:55,178 --> 00:10:00,217
The reports of the count
were grossly exaggerated.

86
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:05,672
Perhaps if I subtract
another ten percent?

87
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,467
- Fifteen.
- Very well.

88
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:11,345
Consider your deal closed.
We'll take everything.

89
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:14,806
You gentlemen had me
worried there for a moment.

90
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,892
- If you please.
- I'd love to.

91
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:19,027
- Right here.
- OK, great.

92
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:23,649
You are obviously not attuned
to the antique market.

93
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:27,277
You see, where we come from,
honey, the legend of Dracula...

94
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:30,239
that's the absolute créme
de la créme of camp!

95
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:33,208
We're gonna get a fortune
for these things.

96
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,620
Count Dracula was no legend.

97
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,373
- He was terribly real.
- Oh, I know.

98
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,875
I've seen all of his movies.
I'm a real fan.

99
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,086
Don't shock the poor man, Billy.

100
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:47,881
Hey, is there anything else? Like
secret passages and things like that?

101
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:52,094
Yes. When the castle was
restored a few years ago,

102
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:55,480
they found several hidden rooms.

103
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,485
Eugh, it smells terrible in here.

104
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,487
Billy, look at this!

105
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,914
Fantastic.

106
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:17,578
Oh, this is gorgeous.
Look at this, Bobby.

107
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:20,289
Honey, this is the coup
d'état of the century.

108
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:24,042
Is this included in our deal,
or are you gonna fleece us now?

109
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,128
You ain't gonna fleece us,
are you, baby?

110
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:28,305
Well, if you want it...

111
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,474
I can't wait to start
tagging all these goodies.

112
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,477
We're gonna be rich, my love.

113
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:26,188
Bobby, man, I can't see in here.

114
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:28,907
I'm gonna light one
of the greasy lamps.

115
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:40,627
Ta-dah!

116
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,300
If the fire department could see
you now, you silly lamp queen.

117
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,547
- Oh, this. I'm dying to open this!
- I'm not.

118
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:57,185
Look, I have a fantastic idea for this.
You'll probably die if I tell you.

119
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:00,222
In that case, spare me.
Let's get on with the tagging.

120
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:03,100
Listen! You know that chintzy
guest bed in the living room?

121
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,185
- Yeah.
- How about this instead?

122
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,728
A coffin?

123
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:08,947
It'll freak everyone out. Open it.

124
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,833
Oh, Bobby!

125
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:31,044
- Look what I've done!
- What the hell did you do?

126
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:34,297
- What did you do? Let me see.
- Ouch.

127
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:37,076
- Don't panic. Wait to see it.
- Oh!

128
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:40,220
Please stop. Hold this there.

129
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,514
Let me... oh...

130
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:46,651
- Bobby, hurry. It's bleeding.
- Just a second!

131
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,523
You're so dizzy. That's the trouble.

132
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:54,568
- Put it up here.
- Just a second. Stop it!

133
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,870
If you weren't so dizzy...

134
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:00,081
Stop that whining.

135
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:03,418
Look at me.

136
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:06,246
- Move your hand.
- That's tight.

137
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,090
I'm not a nurse, you know. All right?

138
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,885
Would you stop it, please?

139
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,504
- Take care. It's twisted.
- I'll take care of it.

140
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,131
I'm gonna bleed to death.

141
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:19,134
You're gonna bleed to death if
you don't keep your mouth shut!

142
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:21,811
Keep quiet. You make me nervous.

143
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:29,736
Bobby, I'll die.
I'm bleeding to death!

144
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,030
Would you stop it, please?

145
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:39,913
Child, be still! Stop!
What's wrong with you?

146
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:52,592
That isn't tight enough.
The blood's seeping through.

147
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:07,015
Bobby, look...

148
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:11,611
Bobby! Bobby!

149
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:50,433
No...

150
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,018
No, no!

151
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,319
No!

152
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,531
No, no!

153
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:26,571
'I curse you with my name.

154
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,957
'You shall be...

155
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:31,701
'Blacula!

156
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:35,080
'A vampire like myself,

157
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,507
'a living fiend.'

158
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:47,527
These are the Williams girls,
friends of the family.

159
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,113
We've come to pay our
respects to Bobby McCoy.

160
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:51,740
Certainly, sir.

161
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,868
These things are
always so very tragic,

162
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:58,955
but I can perhaps be of some comfort
to you in this hour of need.

163
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:02,333
This is one of our smaller rooms,
but it can be expanded

164
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:05,628
to accommodate any
number of mourners.

165
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,213
Why is his hand like that?

166
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,841
This sometimes happens.
It's only a reflex.

167
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:13,344
At his mother's request,
the body has not yet been embalmed.

168
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:16,389
I'll just tidy him up a bit,

169
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:20,610
then leave you alone
with your thoughts.

170
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,116
Poor Bobby. We've known
him since we were kids.

171
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:31,529
Luva.

172
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,907
I just don't understand it.

173
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:37,160
I hope you can find some
answers for us, Gordon.

174
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,413
Why don't you two go on over
to Bobby's mother's house?

175
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,291
She's in pretty bad shape.
I'll stay here.

176
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,176
Let's go.

177
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,846
- Talk to you later.
- All right.

178
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,525
Did I startle you, sir?

179
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,569
I'm so sorry, but I can't
let you disarrange...

180
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:15,373
I'm Dr Thomas with the Scientific
Investigation Division.

181
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,577
Of course. I'm so sorry, doctor.

182
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:22,171
I didn't realise you
were a professional man.

183
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:25,291
I worked very hard
on that neck wound,

184
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,418
trying to make it look
as natural as I could

185
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,504
so it wouldn't be offensive
to his loved ones.

186
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:33,049
The flesh was torn right
out in a big chunk.

187
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:36,052
I've never seen a rat
bite that size before.

188
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,971
- Rat bite?
- Yes, sir.

189
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:40,056
How deep was the wound
before it was repaired?

190
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:43,393
I don't know. Two or
three inches at least.

191
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:46,154
- Two or three inches?
- Yes, sir.

192
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:50,942
Any other bruises or wounds?

193
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:55,405
A slight abrasion on the left elbow,
probably the result of a fall.

194
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:58,158
And you say you didn't embalm?

195
00:20:58,258 --> 00:20:59,792
Yes, sir.

196
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:03,746
It's strange.

197
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,665
That is strange.

198
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:09,218
Look at this. His veins are empty.

199
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:12,755
They collapse with pressure
and don't return to shape,

200
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:16,342
and he wouldn't be this colour
unless he'd lost a lot of blood.

201
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:17,927
Who brought him in?

202
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:21,439
I did. Picked him up at
the coroner's office.

203
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:26,561
Did they mention... much bleeding?

204
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:29,572
I can't say as they did, doctor.

205
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:35,278
What about the other victim,
his associate?

206
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:37,113
I didn't prepare that one.

207
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:40,166
He was white. I don't get
many whites in here.

208
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,620
- Thank you for your help.
- Glad to be of service.

209
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,164
Any time you need my help,
don't hesitate to ask.

210
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:49,083
I'm at your service, doctor.
That's my job...

211
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,428
...doctor.

212
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:01,395
That is the rudest nigger
I've ever seen in my life.

213
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:10,438
Everything's just so
strange, Michelle.

214
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:11,948
I know.

215
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,568
Listen, would you
mind if I begged off?

216
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:18,321
You can handle Mrs McCoy on your own.

217
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:20,114
I'm just really beat.

218
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:23,576
Go on home. I'll just stop by
and see if she needs anything.

219
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:24,994
- Thanks.
- See you later.

220
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:26,337
OK.

221
00:23:17,489 --> 00:23:19,039
Luva?

222
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,908
Luva?

223
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:23,436
- Let go!
- Luva, it's me.

224
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,354
Wait!

225
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:20,693
Goddamnit, man!
You scared the hell out of me.

226
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:23,780
Where did you come from?
Are you all right?

227
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,282
What the hell you run
in front of my cab for?

228
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,159
Can't you see, man?

229
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:30,461
I lost her.

230
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:33,164
Shit.

231
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:37,251
You ain't hurt, man, but you lucky.

232
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:40,588
Chasing tail could get
you killed, you know.

233
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:44,008
I lost her because of you. Imbecile!

234
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:45,593
Imbecile?

235
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:48,346
Who the hell are you
calling an imbecile?

236
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:50,973
You the nut that ran
in front of my cab.

237
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:54,944
You the only imbecile
on this street... boy!

238
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:14,455
You'll find her. She's got
to be round here somewhere.

239
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:19,001
I bet you she's worried right
now and lookin' for you,

240
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:22,672
so why don't you just back
off of me and go get her?

241
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:25,508
I bet she's worried
to death about you.

242
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:28,719
I bet she's called
every hospital around.

243
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:32,106
Listen, take your hands off me!
I don't know you!

244
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:45,463
Tina, get the chain. It's me!

245
00:26:45,563 --> 00:26:48,599
Michelle, thank God.

246
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,603
What you doin' with that knife?

247
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:55,097
Sorry. Get in.

248
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,566
What's wrong with you?

249
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:02,655
Tina, what happened?

250
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:13,566
A man tried to attack me.

251
00:27:13,766 --> 00:27:17,995
He got my purse. I'm sure of it.
He got my keys and all my I.D.

252
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:22,007
When I heard you at the door
just now, I thought it was him.

253
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:25,878
Damn maniacs runnin' the streets.

254
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:28,055
It's all right. It's OK.

255
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:30,266
It's all right.

256
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:55,968
- They'll take care of it for you.
- Thank you.

257
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:59,722
- Bye-bye.
- Hi, Shirley. Sam here?

258
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:02,725
Sure. Sam, Dr Thomas is here.

259
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:04,685
- How ya doin'?
- Fine. You?

260
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:07,071
- Fine. You're lookin' good.
- Thanks.

261
00:29:07,872 --> 00:29:08,814
Doc?

262
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:13,069
I got a call from the coroner's
office to check on Juanita Jones.

263
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:16,121
- You want to see her?
- That's why I'm here.

264
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,913
Thought you worked nights.

265
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:26,674
Everybody takes a vacation but me.

266
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:47,861
There she is, doc.

267
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:54,410
Fine job for a woman, running a cab.

268
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:58,163
You ask me,
she's looking for something.

269
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:02,493
You know what I mean...
"looking for something"?

270
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:04,662
Yes. Sam, get me a cup
of coffee, will you?

271
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:07,423
All right, I can take a hint.

272
00:31:06,407 --> 00:31:08,484
Nah, that's ridiculous.

273
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,523
Jack, I'm beginning to
take this personally.

274
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:19,570
I'm tellin' ya, your men lost the report
on Bobby McCoy and Billy Schaffer.

275
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,789
Lost, my ass.

276
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:24,291
Maureen.

277
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:30,873
- Yes, lieutenant.
- Get the division reports on... who?

278
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:34,168
Bobby McCoy, Billy Schaffer.
From two nights ago.

279
00:31:34,268 --> 00:31:36,470
- Southwest Division.
- Right, lieutenant.

280
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:41,175
Tell me something, man.
Off the record, of course.

281
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:43,260
Yeah?

282
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,554
Who checked the two bodies?

283
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:48,107
In that area, it should be Watson.

284
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:51,661
- Yeah, Watson.
- Is that the guy that...

285
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:55,147
called cyanide poisoning
"heart failure"?

286
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,574
I'm getting tired of
that kind of talk.

287
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:01,654
Division says those reports
were lost before distribution.

288
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:05,366
They said Dr Thomas' office
called this morning about them.

289
00:32:05,466 --> 00:32:08,661
The sergeant told Dr Thomas'
secretary he couldn't find them.

290
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:11,255
Thanks, Maureen. Thank you.

291
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:14,842
So it wasn't my lack of
pull at headquarters.

292
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:20,089
Strange how so many sloppy
police jobs involve black victims.

293
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:22,967
You're getting paranoid.
Schaffer wasn't black.

294
00:32:23,067 --> 00:32:25,135
We'll find them.
I'll send Barnes over.

295
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:27,137
- Yes, lieutenant?
- Get Barnes in here.

296
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:29,014
Look, what's going on?

297
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,892
I see where you've ordered an
autopsy on Bobby McCoy today,

298
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:34,812
and Juanita Jones is
scheduled for one on Friday.

299
00:32:34,912 --> 00:32:37,022
What's going on?
What's the connection?

300
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,733
Did you want me, lieutenant?
Hello, doc.

301
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,986
Get to the Southwest Division
and find the reports

302
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:44,196
on Bobby McCoy and
Billy Schaffer, will you?

303
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,949
Sure, lieutenant. What's goin' on?

304
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:48,375
Do it.

305
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:55,215
You've got something. What is it?

306
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:59,336
- When I know, I'll tell you.
- Does it look organised?

307
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:01,797
There's been a lot of
Panther activity lately.

308
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:04,717
Panthers? Come on,
Jack, don't cop out.

309
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:07,761
Two faggot interior decorators
and a lady cabdriver?

310
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:09,889
Panthers? Oh, come on!

311
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:11,223
Anything is possible.

312
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:16,186
If it's possible, tell Barnes to bring
those reports to the club tonight.

313
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:18,947
It's Michelle's birthday.

314
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:26,405
Have a good time.

315
00:33:34,138 --> 00:33:36,707
- Hello?
- 'This is Dr Thomas.'

316
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:38,042
Yes, Dr Thomas.

317
00:33:38,142 --> 00:33:41,629
Mr Swenson, we're gonna need to
do an autopsy on Bobby McCoy.

318
00:33:41,729 --> 00:33:43,631
I'll send for the body
sometime this afternoon.

319
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:45,090
That's impossible.

320
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,551
The family's here now.
I can't just throw them out.

321
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:49,595
Of course, Mr Swenson.

322
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:52,473
- What time do you close tonight?
- 'Eight o'clock.'

323
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:55,601
All right, I'll have my men
there a little bit after 8:00.

324
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:59,279
- They must be careful.
- They will be, Mr Swenson.

325
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:02,407
- All right, then.
- Thanks.

326
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:07,613
By the way, we had some
excitement ourselves last night.

327
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:09,490
Tina got hassled on the way home.

328
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:12,451
- Is she all right?
- She didn't go to work today.

329
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:15,003
We're having the locks changed.
She thinks he got her purse.

330
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:17,831
Next year, we move to the suburbs.

331
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:20,884
Like we did last year!

332
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:30,719
<i>There he is again</i>

333
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:35,140
<i>And he's making my heart
skip another beat</i>

334
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,643
<i>- Now he's a-movin' in
- Watch out, baby</i>

335
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:41,814
<i>Yeah, he's self-assured
like he was before</i>

336
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:45,442
<i>And I know he thinks I
want him more and more</i>

337
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:47,486
<i>And I know he thinks I want him</i>

338
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:50,831
<i>More and more</i>

339
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:53,117
<i>Oh, hey hey</i>

340
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:56,704
<i>So to myself I say</i>

341
00:34:56,804 --> 00:35:00,332
<i>Look the other way
when he comes by you</i>

342
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:03,919
<i>Look the other way
when he comes by you</i>

343
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:06,046
<i>Look the other way when he</i>

344
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:09,725
<i>Comes by you...</i>

345
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:17,858
<i>Don't let him follow through</i>

346
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:27,568
<i>There! There he is again</i>

347
00:35:27,668 --> 00:35:31,488
<i>And he's leading me on
with that lover's look</i>

348
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:34,491
<i>I said there he is again</i>

349
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:39,121
<i>And he's reading my mind
like it's an open book</i>

350
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:41,832
<i>Now he's a real bad man</i>

351
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:46,253
<i>And he's getting so close
that I can't control</i>

352
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:48,505
<i>And I know he thinks I want him</i>

353
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:50,090
<i>Oh, so much</i>

354
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,342
<i>And I know he thinks I want him</i>

355
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:54,311
<i>Oh, so much</i>

356
00:35:57,614 --> 00:36:01,268
<i>So to myself I say</i>

357
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:04,855
<i>Look the other way
when he comes by you</i>

358
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:08,442
<i>Look the other way
when he comes by you</i>

359
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:10,527
<i>Look the other way when he</i>

360
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:14,915
<i>Comes by you...</i>

361
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:22,714
<i>Don't let him follow through</i>

362
00:36:28,896 --> 00:36:31,799
<i>Oh, there he is again</i>

363
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:36,053
<i>And he's looking at me
from across the street</i>

364
00:36:36,153 --> 00:36:39,431
<i>I said there, there he is again</i>

365
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:43,568
<i>And he's making my little heart
skip another beat</i>

366
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:47,147
<i>- Now he's movin' in
- Watch out, baby</i>

367
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:50,734
<i>And he's self-assured
like he was before</i>

368
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:54,363
<i>And I know he thinks I
want him more and more</i>

369
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:56,907
<i>And I know he thinks I want him</i>

370
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:59,376
<i>More and more</i>

371
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:04,957
<i>So to myself</i>

372
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:09,511
<i>I say look the other way
when he comes by you...</i>

373
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:12,472
Come join my friends.

374
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:24,143
I'd like you to meet my sister
Michelle and Dr Gordon Thomas.

375
00:37:24,243 --> 00:37:27,146
- This is...
- I'm called Mamuwalde.

376
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:28,480
Nice to meet you.

377
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,857
Enchanté, mademoiselle.

378
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:32,401
It's my sister's birthday party.
Would you care to join us?

379
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:34,411
I'd be delighted, thank you.

380
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:39,032
Champagne, please? French.

381
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:40,492
That won't be necessary.

382
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:43,162
What do you mean? I like champagne.

383
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:45,046
Good. So do I.

384
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:48,542
Tina, where did you find your purse?

385
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:51,761
Mamuwalde returned it to me.
Thank you again.

386
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:54,631
You bear an amazing
resemblance to my wife,

387
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:57,893
whom I lost a short while ago.

388
00:37:58,235 --> 00:37:59,428
I'm very sorry.

389
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:01,771
I loved her very much.

390
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:06,276
When you left the mortuary,
I had to follow you.

391
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:09,188
I didn't consider that
I might frighten you.

392
00:38:09,288 --> 00:38:12,324
You were at Swenson's.
Were you a friend of Bobby's?

393
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:16,786
No, I was there making some
arrangements of my own.

394
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,865
But enough about death.

395
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:21,950
Here's to... life.

396
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,577
- On your birthday.
- Thank you.

397
00:38:23,677 --> 00:38:24,995
Happy birthday, baby.

398
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:27,923
- To happiness.
- To happiness forever.

399
00:38:57,836 --> 00:39:01,531
<i>I know you been running around</i>

400
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:04,376
<i>Playing me for a fool</i>

401
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:10,582
<i>But one thing you don't know, baby</i>

402
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:13,718
<i>I know just what to do for you</i>

403
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,256
<i>You out there having fun...</i>

404
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:18,932
Dr Thomas here.

405
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,768
What?

406
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:25,397
What do you mean, gone?

407
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:28,850
Listen, calm down,
Swenson. Calm down.

408
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,861
I'll get a man over there right away.

409
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,398
Don't touch anything, you hear me?

410
00:39:34,498 --> 00:39:37,734
Swenson, damn it!
Don't touch anything!

411
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:40,779
<i>I'm gonna catch ya, baby</i>

412
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:42,406
<i>Wait and see</i>

413
00:39:42,506 --> 00:39:43,907
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

414
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:47,085
<i>Yes, I like what kind
of line you got for me</i>

415
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:52,173
<i>You told me you were going to score</i>

416
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:55,627
<i>I found that I was
due to be your amour</i>

417
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:57,379
<i>Well, all right</i>

418
00:39:57,479 --> 00:40:00,257
<i>You wanted me to go for that</i>

419
00:40:00,357 --> 00:40:02,426
<i>Girl, let's stay at home...</i>

420
00:40:02,526 --> 00:40:04,636
Look at that face. What happened?

421
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:08,398
That was Swenson.
Bobby's body just disappeared.

422
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:11,852
- That's impossible.
- Perhaps he wasn't dead.

423
00:40:11,952 --> 00:40:13,812
What the hell does that mean?

424
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:16,273
He was as dead as you can get.
I examined him myself.

425
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:18,275
Just a passing thought.

426
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:20,702
What's happening? How's everybody?

427
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:25,332
How you doin'? My name is Skillet.
How's everything?

428
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:29,328
Let's pull up a seat here and
get some of this here...

429
00:40:29,428 --> 00:40:31,496
- Join the party.
- ...champagne.

430
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,790
- Help yourself.
- French champagne!

431
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,334
We gonna be gone.

432
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:37,502
Happy birthday, Michelle.

433
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:40,513
What kind of down
birthday party is this?

434
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:44,259
And hold it. Get you.

435
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:45,635
All right, come on.

436
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:48,263
Beautiful! Why don't you all
scoot in here together?

437
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:51,099
Please forgive me. I must depart now.

438
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,809
I have indeed had a rare pleasure.

439
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:55,695
Brother, why don't you stick around?

440
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,741
- Please, don't go.
- Where's he going?

441
00:41:03,837 --> 00:41:05,572
Mamuwalde,

442
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:07,115
please wait.

443
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:11,161
Say, man, that is one strange dude.

444
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:14,881
- Who is he?
- One strange dude.

445
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,709
I gotta check this cat out again.

446
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,928
Did you see the rags he had on?

447
00:41:21,188 --> 00:41:24,591
That's a bad cape. I'd like
to beat him out of that cape.

448
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:26,927
Will you meet me here
tomorrow evening?

449
00:41:27,027 --> 00:41:30,222
I need very much to see you.

450
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:31,898
I'll be here.

451
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:37,487
Beautiful! I think
romance is in the air.

452
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:45,112
- Hey, baby.
- Tina, you all right?

453
00:41:45,212 --> 00:41:46,530
Sure.

454
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:49,157
Mama, how come you never
look at me that way?

455
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:50,867
There's a reason, Skillet.

456
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:53,787
I guess we're through,
so I'll take these prints,

457
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:56,790
run over to my studio,
develop these, and be right back.

458
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:59,467
Mama, don't you want
a little company?

459
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:01,628
No, thanks.

460
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:04,423
I know what would develop
with you in a darkroom.

461
00:42:04,523 --> 00:42:08,643
- It wouldn't be my pictures.
- Right on, baby. I hear ya.

462
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,730
Yeah?

463
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:21,609
Hey... Wait a minute.

464
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:25,029
Where's that big dude with the cape?

465
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:29,826
He was standing right next to her.

466
00:44:40,637 --> 00:44:42,589
Oh, God!

467
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:29,711
- Help me.
- What happened, lady?

468
00:45:29,811 --> 00:45:31,971
Oh, help me, please.

469
00:45:34,941 --> 00:45:36,301
Do you live here?

470
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:39,103
I need your help.

471
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:56,529
- You got your damn report?
- Not me.

472
00:45:56,629 --> 00:45:59,491
Don't give me that crap. I sent
Barnes to the club last night.

473
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:01,876
No crap. I didn't get it.

474
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:04,663
- Christ's sake. Maureen?
- Yes, sir.

475
00:46:04,763 --> 00:46:07,707
Get Barnes. Tell him he better
get his ass in here fast.

476
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:09,918
Anything on that missing body report?

477
00:46:10,018 --> 00:46:13,630
Nothing. No fingerprints,
no signs of breaking and entering.

478
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:17,133
Not a thing. Who the hell
would want a dead faggot?

479
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:19,135
I can't take any more problems.

480
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:21,763
Then you'll be thrilled to
know I would like permission

481
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:24,440
to dig up Billy Schaffer
to do an autopsy.

482
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:26,351
You're nuts!

483
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:29,771
You know what I've got to do to
get permission to dig up a grave?

484
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:32,273
Besides, you've got something
you don't want me to have.

485
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:36,403
- I don't like it.
- I just don't have it all together.

486
00:46:36,503 --> 00:46:40,115
If I told you my crazy idea,
you'd just laugh at me.

487
00:46:40,215 --> 00:46:43,493
Forget the permits.
I don't work in the dark.

488
00:46:43,593 --> 00:46:46,254
Jack, I need your help.

489
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:50,709
There's a connection here.
That's all I know.

490
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:53,052
Just give me a little more time.

491
00:46:54,062 --> 00:46:55,805
Get me that permit, man.

492
00:46:59,067 --> 00:47:00,435
Solid.

493
00:47:03,071 --> 00:47:04,848
What's the sudden interest in ghouls?

494
00:47:04,948 --> 00:47:09,602
The librarian thinks we're nuts...
and she's not the only one.

495
00:47:09,702 --> 00:47:11,521
- Dr Thomas' office.
- 'Gordon there?'

496
00:47:11,621 --> 00:47:14,691
One moment, please.
Gordon, it's Peters.

497
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:15,900
Yeah, Jack.

498
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,111
'Couldn't get permission
to exhume McCoy's grave.'

499
00:47:18,211 --> 00:47:20,989
You're a big help.
Thanks a lot for nothing.

500
00:47:21,089 --> 00:47:23,116
'I'm sorry. My hands are tied.'

501
00:47:23,216 --> 00:47:25,952
- Yeah.
- 'I tried. It's tough to get.'

502
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:27,954
- We'll talk later.
- 'You understand?'

503
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:29,422
Yeah!

504
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:31,299
Yeah.

505
00:47:33,852 --> 00:47:38,056
Baby, you better sit down, cos I
got something heavy to lay on you.

506
00:47:42,277 --> 00:47:44,103
Lay it on me.

507
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:49,642
We're gonna dig up Billy's body.

508
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:51,561
Ghouls, vampires, now bodies.

509
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:54,405
I take it back.
We're not nuts, you are.

510
00:47:55,999 --> 00:47:58,777
What's more, we're gonna
have to do it tonight.

511
00:47:58,877 --> 00:48:00,278
No we're not.

512
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:03,239
You ain't gettin' this nigger
in no graveyard tonight.

513
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:04,991
Come on, baby. Come on.

514
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:08,203
You going with grown people.
You're supposed to stick with me.

515
00:48:08,303 --> 00:48:11,206
- Gordon, I'm always with you, right?
- Right, right.

516
00:48:11,306 --> 00:48:13,958
- But not this time.
- Come on, babe. Come on.

517
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:15,593
Just for me?

518
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:17,929
Nope.

519
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:26,554
You're so bad.

520
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:28,439
You're so good.

521
00:48:29,198 --> 00:48:31,226
Run home and change
into some old clothes.

522
00:48:31,326 --> 00:48:33,236
- I'll pick you up later.
- OK.

523
00:49:09,948 --> 00:49:13,643
- Good evening, Tina.
- Hello, Mamuwalde.

524
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:16,521
- I thought we were to meet at...
- Yes, at the club.

525
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:19,107
But I couldn't wait to see you.

526
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:21,901
I need to speak to you alone.
May I come in?

527
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:23,911
Of course you can.

528
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:29,033
I found it a little hard
to leave you last night,

529
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:31,669
but I had no choice.

530
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,247
I wanted to run after you

531
00:49:34,347 --> 00:49:37,333
and I've never felt that way before.

532
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:41,045
- You frightened me.
- No, you mustn't be frightened.

533
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:44,257
Let me try and help you understand.

534
00:49:44,357 --> 00:49:46,434
Is it about your wife?

535
00:49:48,069 --> 00:49:50,062
You are my wife.

536
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:53,941
That's impossible, Mamuwalde.

537
00:49:56,452 --> 00:49:58,112
And yet you believe it.

538
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:03,776
I don't know what I believe anymore,

539
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:07,705
but help me, and I'll
try to understand.

540
00:50:09,132 --> 00:50:13,745
We are of the Abani tribe, you and I,

541
00:50:13,845 --> 00:50:16,664
northeast of the Niger Delta.

542
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:19,250
Our people are renowned as hunters.

543
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:22,128
Almost two centuries ago,

544
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:24,213
the ruling elders of my people

545
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:28,343
sent me, yes, and my bride to Europe

546
00:50:28,443 --> 00:50:31,721
on a mission to protest
the slave trade.

547
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:33,181
The slave trade?

548
00:50:33,281 --> 00:50:37,944
On that mission, I myself was
enslaved, my wife murdered,

549
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:41,197
and I was placed under
the curse of the undead.

550
00:50:41,831 --> 00:50:44,692
Our assassin was the
vampire Count Dracula.

551
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:47,578
Count Dracula is a myth.

552
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:50,615
- He wasn't real.
- Oh, yes, he was real...

553
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:52,742
as real as I am now,

554
00:50:52,842 --> 00:50:56,504
as real as you are
and my need for you.

555
00:50:57,764 --> 00:51:01,459
You are my Luva recreated.

556
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,761
What are you asking of me?

557
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:07,757
I want you to rejoin me.

558
00:51:07,857 --> 00:51:09,976
I can't.

559
00:51:10,485 --> 00:51:12,228
I can't.

560
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:18,359
Well, you must come to
me freely, with love...

561
00:51:19,327 --> 00:51:21,112
or not at all.

562
00:51:22,205 --> 00:51:26,367
I will not take you by force
and I will not return.

563
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:41,799
I have lived again to lose you twice.

564
00:51:42,517 --> 00:51:44,802
Mamuwalde.

565
00:51:46,354 --> 00:51:48,306
Stay with me.

566
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,104
Please?

567
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:36,145
Will you talk to me before
I go out of my mind?

568
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:41,809
Don't sweat it, baby.
We're almost there.

569
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:44,236
What do you expect to find, anyway?

570
00:52:46,414 --> 00:52:49,784
Nothing, I hope. Hold the
light over here, will you?

571
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:56,207
Hurry up and let's get
the hell out of here.

572
00:53:39,175 --> 00:53:41,035
Don't!

573
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:43,287
Gordon, no!

574
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:45,164
Don't!

575
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:48,584
No! No! No!

576
00:53:48,684 --> 00:53:51,838
Don't kill him! Oh, God!

577
00:53:51,938 --> 00:53:54,090
No, don't! Stop!

578
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:56,926
- It's all right.
- He was alive!

579
00:53:57,026 --> 00:53:59,887
- You killed him!
- Michelle, he wasn't alive.

580
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:03,099
He was killed by a vampire.
He wasn't alive or dead.

581
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:05,443
We just put him out of his misery.

582
00:54:07,453 --> 00:54:08,646
Easy.

583
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:10,906
Easy, yes.

584
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:20,833
All those books.

585
00:54:21,968 --> 00:54:24,162
You must have known something.

586
00:54:24,262 --> 00:54:26,247
Why didn't you tell me?

587
00:54:26,347 --> 00:54:28,716
You never would have believed me.

588
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:33,762
No.

589
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,056
No.

590
00:54:42,321 --> 00:54:43,939
Gordon.

591
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:47,476
Does that mean that Bobby...

592
00:54:47,576 --> 00:54:49,069
Right.

593
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:52,148
He's a vampire, too.

594
00:54:52,248 --> 00:54:54,074
He could be anywhere.

595
00:54:56,419 --> 00:54:58,454
What are we gonna do?

596
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:03,834
You better tell Peters.

597
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:06,329
Telling him won't work.

598
00:55:06,429 --> 00:55:08,797
No, we gotta show him somehow.

599
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:12,676
I wish he could see what I saw.

600
00:55:16,022 --> 00:55:17,924
- Juanita Jones.
- What?

601
00:55:18,024 --> 00:55:21,352
The cabbie. Come on, let's go.

602
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:47,828
- Morgue.
- 'Sam, this is Dr Thomas.'

603
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:51,791
- Yeah?
- You remember that lady cabbie?

604
00:55:51,891 --> 00:55:55,086
What do you mean, I remember?
Nothing wrong with my memory!

605
00:55:55,186 --> 00:55:57,213
Take her out of deep freeze.

606
00:55:57,313 --> 00:55:58,381
Why?

607
00:55:58,481 --> 00:56:01,425
'I'm coming over with Lieutenant Peters.
I want her body warm.'

608
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:05,179
Take her out, leave the room,
make sure to lock the door.

609
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:06,472
Yeah, yeah, OK.

610
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:10,359
Sam, don't "yeah" me. Lock it!

611
00:56:16,207 --> 00:56:18,492
Do I remember?

612
00:56:41,315 --> 00:56:43,392
All right, all right!

613
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,980
I'm coming!

614
00:57:18,561 --> 00:57:20,546
This better be good.
First night off in weeks.

615
00:57:20,646 --> 00:57:21,839
Sorry, Jill. It's important.

616
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:24,642
Don't you think I'm
used to it by now?

617
00:57:25,276 --> 00:57:26,510
- Hi.
- Hi, honey.

618
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,471
You sure it's all
right if I stay here?

619
00:57:28,571 --> 00:57:30,105
Course. Come on in.

620
00:58:16,952 --> 00:58:18,104
Morgue.

621
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:37,164
Yeah. Oh?

622
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:03,816
My Tina...

623
00:59:03,916 --> 00:59:06,152
you're so beautiful.

624
00:59:06,252 --> 00:59:08,028
I won't let you leave me.

625
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:10,156
I must. There is no other way.

626
00:59:10,256 --> 00:59:12,207
To stay is to die.

627
00:59:13,175 --> 00:59:14,618
I wanna go with you,

628
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:16,503
but I'm afraid.

629
00:59:17,012 --> 00:59:19,498
I promise you it will not be...

630
00:59:19,598 --> 00:59:21,292
unpleasant

631
00:59:21,392 --> 00:59:23,510
or painful.

632
00:59:25,396 --> 00:59:27,556
But there's still time.

633
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:30,851
All time belongs to us.

634
00:59:39,702 --> 00:59:42,488
I must go now. It's almost daylight.

635
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:48,786
I love you.

636
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:05,844
Sam?

637
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,138
Not in there.

638
01:00:09,565 --> 01:00:11,141
Sam!

639
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:14,637
Oh, my God!

640
01:00:14,737 --> 01:00:16,347
Jesus.

641
01:00:16,447 --> 01:00:19,149
Sam! Sam!

642
01:00:19,408 --> 01:00:21,318
Follow me and stay close.

643
01:01:03,744 --> 01:01:05,946
That's what I couldn't
tell you about.

644
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:09,366
That's why you had to
see it for yourself.

645
01:01:10,376 --> 01:01:12,369
I wouldn't have believed it.

646
01:01:15,381 --> 01:01:16,999
Sun killed her.

647
01:01:18,842 --> 01:01:21,745
Vampires multiply geometrically.

648
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:26,208
First night there was one,
second night two, third night four.

649
01:01:26,308 --> 01:01:27,543
It's a goddamn epidemic.

650
01:01:27,643 --> 01:01:32,256
It explains McCoy's
disappearance from Swenson's.

651
01:01:32,356 --> 01:01:35,517
- And now with Sam...
- Do you have any suggestions?

652
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:41,765
How about an APB on McCoy and Sam?

653
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:44,435
APBs on dead men. Lovely.

654
01:01:44,535 --> 01:01:47,771
Great headlines. That should
get us mass hysteria.

655
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:51,358
Forget hysteria.
Mass unemployment, starting with me.

656
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:54,737
We'd better swamp the city
with police, cars on every corner.

657
01:01:54,837 --> 01:01:59,283
It won't make any sense...
to start until after dark.

658
01:01:59,383 --> 01:02:00,918
Keep in touch with me.

659
01:02:02,511 --> 01:02:04,538
Yeah, I'll let your
office know where I am.

660
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:06,840
Get some sleep. You look like hell.

661
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:10,844
Sure.

662
01:02:18,485 --> 01:02:20,771
I got something to check out.

663
01:02:22,781 --> 01:02:26,360
<i>You and all your friends</i>

664
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:30,147
<i>Are gonna get together
in the end and tell me</i>

665
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:33,659
<i>What the world knows</i>

666
01:02:34,042 --> 01:02:36,870
<i>About love</i>

667
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:41,375
<i>Yes, you will</i>

668
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:45,212
<i>Yes, you will</i>

669
01:02:48,807 --> 01:02:51,593
<i>Tell me how much you love me</i>

670
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:55,464
<i>Yeah, you gonna tell me
how it could have been</i>

671
01:02:55,564 --> 01:02:59,476
<i>If I had known more</i>

672
01:02:59,777 --> 01:03:02,729
<i>About love</i>

673
01:03:03,906 --> 01:03:05,941
<i>Yes, you will...</i>

674
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:08,143
- Good evening.
- How you doin'?

675
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:09,937
Sit down and have a drink.

676
01:03:10,037 --> 01:03:12,690
Thank you very much.
Very thoughtful of you.

677
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:13,982
Hi. What'll you have?

678
01:03:14,082 --> 01:03:15,984
Make it a Bloody Mary.

679
01:03:16,084 --> 01:03:18,445
Mamuwalde, maybe you can help me.

680
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:21,240
Are you into the occult?

681
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:23,333
It has some fascination.

682
01:03:24,676 --> 01:03:27,129
How about the heavy stuff?

683
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:30,799
Witchcraft, voodoo...

684
01:03:31,642 --> 01:03:33,051
devil worship.

685
01:03:34,019 --> 01:03:35,462
Well, we can't ignore

686
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:39,349
what the world characterises
as the "black arts", can we?

687
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:43,554
I think that there's
some truth in all of it.

688
01:03:43,654 --> 01:03:45,605
I've come to that conclusion myself.

689
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:50,602
- What do you think of vampires?
- Vampires?

690
01:03:50,702 --> 01:03:53,363
They're possibly the
most fascinating of all.

691
01:03:55,541 --> 01:03:58,986
Do you... believe they exist?

692
01:03:59,086 --> 01:04:02,039
Does the devil exist?

693
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:05,459
People have believed so
for thousands of years.

694
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:07,995
You seem well informed.

695
01:04:08,095 --> 01:04:10,247
Oh, perhaps.

696
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:13,967
The police have a theory
about these killings.

697
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:17,755
Are we to assume that
they believe a vampire

698
01:04:17,855 --> 01:04:20,424
or some other such
creature is responsible?

699
01:04:20,524 --> 01:04:22,392
A vampire.

700
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:24,511
Fascinating.

701
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:28,390
However, many in the
department don't believe it.

702
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:31,693
I would think that to be the
vampire's greatest defence.

703
01:04:32,703 --> 01:04:35,147
You're right.

704
01:04:35,247 --> 01:04:38,275
Still, they're organising a search.

705
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:39,860
Search?

706
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:43,205
Yeah, find his resting place,
a vampire's coffin.

707
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:48,285
Perhaps the modern vampire
doesn't require a coffin.

708
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:51,171
They are rather elusive, you know.

709
01:04:51,722 --> 01:04:54,291
What's happening, everybody?
What's goin' on?

710
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:57,127
- Hey, Skillet.
- How you doin'?

711
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:59,171
- How you doin', doc?
- What's happening?

712
01:04:59,271 --> 01:05:01,882
My darling, we really
must be leaving now.

713
01:05:01,982 --> 01:05:03,926
Tina, I wish you'd stay with us.

714
01:05:04,026 --> 01:05:06,887
I'm sorry, but I'd rather
go with Mamuwalde.

715
01:05:06,987 --> 01:05:10,724
Say, Mamuwalde, let me buy
that old cape from you, brother.

716
01:05:15,621 --> 01:05:20,367
You know, he is a strange dude.

717
01:05:21,209 --> 01:05:23,779
Ran off of me like he did
Nancy the other night.

718
01:05:23,879 --> 01:05:25,956
Anybody seen Nancy?

719
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:29,576
No. She didn't bring my
birthday pictures back, either.

720
01:05:29,676 --> 01:05:31,328
Haven't seen her
since the other night.

721
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:33,121
Look here, brother.

722
01:05:33,221 --> 01:05:35,165
When you do see her,

723
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:37,960
tell Nancy that big Skillet

724
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:41,638
has got something
really groovy for her.

725
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:44,284
Mamuwalde.

726
01:06:46,795 --> 01:06:48,371
He's with Tina!

727
01:06:55,178 --> 01:06:58,749
How could you be so blasé?
What were you trying to prove?

728
01:06:58,849 --> 01:07:01,209
They mean nothing to me.

729
01:07:01,309 --> 01:07:03,511
No one matters but you.

730
01:07:05,814 --> 01:07:08,183
Hold me. Just hold me.

731
01:07:23,498 --> 01:07:25,200
Tina...

732
01:07:26,043 --> 01:07:27,911
Come with me tonight.

733
01:07:36,094 --> 01:07:37,420
Stop!

734
01:07:37,888 --> 01:07:40,207
No, Mamuwalde! Please don't hurt him!

735
01:07:40,307 --> 01:07:42,092
No, no!

736
01:07:43,143 --> 01:07:45,053
Gordon, are you all right?

737
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:55,730
Hold it, mister!

738
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:39,816
You met him. Who is he?

739
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:45,105
God only knows. He calls
himself "Mamuwalde".

740
01:08:45,205 --> 01:08:47,858
- Where does he hang out?
- Hang out?

741
01:08:47,958 --> 01:08:50,452
In a coffin around here somewhere.

742
01:08:51,586 --> 01:08:53,321
- Hi, babe.
- Hi.

743
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:55,240
- How is Tina?
- I don't know.

744
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:57,625
I tried to get her to lie down, but...

745
01:08:59,803 --> 01:09:02,456
Tina, you should still be resting.

746
01:09:02,556 --> 01:09:04,541
I will. What happened?

747
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:06,960
- We heard shots.
- He killed a cop.

748
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:11,139
- He killed him?
- He killed him, and he got away.

749
01:09:15,944 --> 01:09:17,520
You should rest.

750
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:21,107
What do we do now?

751
01:09:22,409 --> 01:09:23,518
Now we wait.

752
01:09:23,618 --> 01:09:27,981
The only thing for sure is that
he has to return to his coffin...

753
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:30,325
before daylight.

754
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:45,540
- Danny, take a look at that fag.
- Yeah, I'm lookin'.

755
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:48,210
- Isn't that the one?
- Sure looks like the one.

756
01:09:48,310 --> 01:09:51,388
How can you tell?
They all look alike.

757
01:09:58,195 --> 01:10:00,772
Hello? Just a minute. Jack?

758
01:10:02,449 --> 01:10:04,109
Yeah?

759
01:10:04,576 --> 01:10:05,777
Where?

760
01:10:07,037 --> 01:10:09,739
OK, tell them to keep a
bead on them but hold back.

761
01:10:10,165 --> 01:10:12,192
They found Bobby.
He's picked up a friend.

762
01:10:12,292 --> 01:10:15,445
- Oh, my God.
- Keep Tina here no matter what.

763
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:17,739
We'll leave some men
to watch the place.

764
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:20,166
Let's go. That guy
with him is in trouble.

765
01:10:23,303 --> 01:10:26,256
- Keep this with you.
- OK.

766
01:10:34,648 --> 01:10:36,975
The subject is heading east on 5th.

767
01:10:38,026 --> 01:10:41,020
Get a grid over that area. Maybe we
can figure out where they're going.

768
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:56,744
They're gone, lieutenant.
We lost them in an alley.

769
01:10:57,295 --> 01:11:00,240
Don't... repeat,
don't follow on foot.

770
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:01,741
We'll take over from here.

771
01:11:01,841 --> 01:11:03,585
Right, lieutenant.

772
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:07,622
Name every building in that sector.

773
01:11:07,722 --> 01:11:09,799
Go through it street by street.

774
01:11:10,642 --> 01:11:12,802
We've pinpointed that sector.

775
01:11:13,853 --> 01:11:17,891
'Buildings are as follows:
Jacob Iron Foundry...'

776
01:11:18,358 --> 01:11:20,927
This will never work.

777
01:11:21,027 --> 01:11:24,564
We got no choice.
We gotta keep going.

778
01:11:25,115 --> 01:11:29,311
...Alameda and 3rd,
Direct Wholesale Clothing,

779
01:11:29,411 --> 01:11:30,604
Torrés Cement,

780
01:11:30,704 --> 01:11:34,524
'Andrew Brothers Warehouse,
Municipal...'

781
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:36,818
That's it! The warehouse.
That's where it started.

782
01:11:36,918 --> 01:11:39,112
That's where they found
McCoy and Schaffer.

783
01:11:46,344 --> 01:11:49,506
Barnes, where the hell
have you been? Come on!

784
01:12:17,584 --> 01:12:19,494
What the hell is that?

785
01:13:03,963 --> 01:13:05,081
Lieutenant!

786
01:13:09,636 --> 01:13:10,837
Watch it!

787
01:13:27,654 --> 01:13:28,980
Watch it!

788
01:13:55,723 --> 01:13:57,133
Johnson!

789
01:13:59,144 --> 01:14:01,379
It won't do any good! It's too late!

790
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:04,548
Johnson!

791
01:14:23,168 --> 01:14:25,453
Get ready to throw these things.

792
01:14:28,298 --> 01:14:29,832
Now!

793
01:14:50,778 --> 01:14:51,888
Barnes!

794
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:53,523
Peters!

795
01:14:56,576 --> 01:14:59,028
Peters, throw it! Th row it!

796
01:15:00,246 --> 01:15:01,781
Peters!

797
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:27,849
I got your back.

798
01:15:59,222 --> 01:16:01,291
Good evening, gentlemen.

799
01:16:01,391 --> 01:16:04,385
I say, were you looking for me?

800
01:16:05,228 --> 01:16:09,215
I should have told you this evening
that I decided to move my coffin,

801
01:16:09,315 --> 01:16:11,468
but, then, it was you
who gave me the idea.

802
01:16:11,568 --> 01:16:13,511
Is that what you got
planned for Tina?

803
01:16:13,611 --> 01:16:15,855
You know nothing of that!

804
01:16:16,948 --> 01:16:19,392
Tina's life means more
to me than my own.

805
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:20,985
Does it?

806
01:16:21,953 --> 01:16:26,065
I could dispense with
you now, doctor,

807
01:16:26,165 --> 01:16:31,746
but I have a rather urgent
appointment elsewhere.

808
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:41,130
My God.

809
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:51,132
You've got no choice!
Whether you want to face it or not,

810
01:16:51,232 --> 01:16:56,187
that man, if you can give him that,
has killed innocent people.

811
01:16:58,323 --> 01:16:59,816
I know.

812
01:17:00,867 --> 01:17:02,769
Just like that, "I know"?

813
01:17:02,869 --> 01:17:05,522
Tina, this isn't some nut
from a Halloween party!

814
01:17:05,622 --> 01:17:07,031
That man is the real thing.

815
01:17:07,874 --> 01:17:10,401
What do you want me to do about it?

816
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:14,989
- You gotta help us.
- I can't.

817
01:17:15,089 --> 01:17:17,492
What do you mean, "I can't"?

818
01:17:17,592 --> 01:17:21,462
Look, Tina, anybody could be next.
Gordon or me. Is that what you want?

819
01:17:24,557 --> 01:17:25,883
No.

820
01:17:30,104 --> 01:17:32,382
We have to stop him.

821
01:17:32,482 --> 01:17:34,851
It's the only decision possible.

822
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:37,728
Say you're with us.

823
01:17:42,909 --> 01:17:44,694
OK.

824
01:17:46,788 --> 01:17:49,615
Look, I gotta cut out
and help Peters.

825
01:17:49,916 --> 01:17:52,402
If he comes for you
tonight, we're ready.

826
01:17:52,502 --> 01:17:54,912
These streets will be
packed with police.

827
01:17:55,630 --> 01:17:59,041
There's no other way, Tina, OK?

828
01:18:03,971 --> 01:18:06,541
OK, the whole block is sealed off.

829
01:18:06,641 --> 01:18:10,169
'You people will have
to get off the streets.

830
01:18:10,269 --> 01:18:12,255
'Go to your homes.

831
01:18:12,355 --> 01:18:14,591
'Please go to your homes.

832
01:18:14,691 --> 01:18:17,510
'These streets need to be kept clear.

833
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:19,478
'We must have your cooperation.

834
01:18:20,363 --> 01:18:22,890
'Please clear the street.

835
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:25,234
'Go to your homes.'

836
01:18:31,749 --> 01:18:36,446
'There's nothing happening here,
nothing to get excited about.

837
01:18:36,546 --> 01:18:39,157
'Now, please go to your homes.

838
01:18:39,257 --> 01:18:42,209
'Please cooperate by
clearing the streets.'

839
01:18:44,721 --> 01:18:47,457
'If we don't get your cooperation,

840
01:18:47,557 --> 01:18:50,585
'we'll have to declare a curfew.

841
01:18:50,685 --> 01:18:53,546
'Please leave the streets
and return to your homes...'

842
01:18:53,646 --> 01:18:55,048
Where?

843
01:18:55,148 --> 01:18:57,058
Tell me where.

844
01:18:58,401 --> 01:19:02,096
Please clear the streets
and return to your homes.

845
01:19:02,196 --> 01:19:05,099
'Please cooperate by
leaving the streets

846
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:06,976
'and returning to your homes.

847
01:19:07,076 --> 01:19:09,562
'Please cooperate with
the police officers.'

848
01:19:09,662 --> 01:19:13,566
A bat! A bat! A giant bat!

849
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:15,409
- It's him.
- Tina...!

850
01:19:17,754 --> 01:19:19,246
Tina?

851
01:19:19,839 --> 01:19:21,582
Gordon, she's gone.

852
01:19:33,644 --> 01:19:35,838
Attention, all units,
this is Lieutenant Peters.

853
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:39,008
'All units, Lieutenant Peters.
Do not apprehend the girl.

854
01:19:39,108 --> 01:19:41,477
'Just survey and watch for suspect.'

855
01:20:12,642 --> 01:20:14,419
This is Unit 603.

856
01:20:14,519 --> 01:20:16,629
We are proceeding east on Florence.

857
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:18,297
No sign of subject.

858
01:20:18,397 --> 01:20:22,018
<i>Come love, give to me</i>

859
01:20:23,152 --> 01:20:27,732
<i>We will take the sky...</i>

860
01:20:29,033 --> 01:20:31,360
Hey, isn't that her?

861
01:20:31,828 --> 01:20:33,229
Drive on by.

862
01:20:33,329 --> 01:20:38,075
<i>I see my main chance with you</i>

863
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:43,289
<i>If my main chance falls through</i>

864
01:20:44,131 --> 01:20:51,205
<i>I could live forever</i>

865
01:20:51,305 --> 01:20:57,795
<i>But I'd know I'll never</i>

866
01:20:57,895 --> 01:21:04,393
<i>Have a chance at living</i>

867
01:21:04,777 --> 01:21:07,146
<i>Again...</i>

868
01:21:08,614 --> 01:21:11,559
Unit 3, Baker 92. It looks like her.

869
01:21:11,659 --> 01:21:14,437
'She's entering Underground
Chemical Plant No. 2

870
01:21:14,537 --> 01:21:16,272
'at 6th and Church.'

871
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:17,948
Let's go.

872
01:23:01,811 --> 01:23:04,221
What is it? What's going on?

873
01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:15,683
You two take that side.

874
01:23:15,783 --> 01:23:17,359
Come on.

875
01:23:58,659 --> 01:24:01,103
- Where is he?
- Down there, sir.

876
01:24:01,203 --> 01:24:03,606
All right, if you find him,
don't try to take him.

877
01:24:03,706 --> 01:24:05,650
Just back off and yell
for me or Dr Thomas.

878
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:08,202
- Keep your eyes open for his coffin.
- Let's go.

879
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:33,219
Help me... please.

880
01:24:33,319 --> 01:24:36,522
Tina... Tina... Don't die, Tina.

881
01:24:57,384 --> 01:24:59,169
My Luva.

882
01:25:00,513 --> 01:25:02,923
I cannot lose you again.

883
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:06,719
Forgive me. Now this is the only way.

884
01:25:07,603 --> 01:25:11,598
You will be with me... always.

885
01:25:25,538 --> 01:25:27,406
Dr Thomas!

886
01:25:28,249 --> 01:25:30,242
Dr Thomas!

887
01:25:31,085 --> 01:25:34,321
You and your dear friends are dead.

888
01:25:34,421 --> 01:25:37,291
Not one man shall
escape my vengeance!

889
01:25:37,758 --> 01:25:40,828
Not one man shall leave here alive!

890
01:25:40,928 --> 01:25:45,374
Search out every shadow,
every corner...

891
01:25:45,474 --> 01:25:48,711
This will be your inglorious tomb!

892
01:25:48,811 --> 01:25:50,171
Your tomb!

893
01:25:50,271 --> 01:25:53,223
Your tomb! Your tomb!

894
01:26:56,462 --> 01:26:59,289
We got him! He's up here. Quick!

895
01:27:36,001 --> 01:27:38,320
Lieutenant.

896
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:40,372
Over here!

897
01:27:50,057 --> 01:27:52,676
Stay here. Stay with her.

898
01:28:36,437 --> 01:28:37,713
- Grab her!
- Let me go!

899
01:28:37,813 --> 01:28:42,218
- Get her out of here!
- Let me go! Stop!

900
01:28:42,318 --> 01:28:44,561
Stop it! Let me go!

901
01:28:45,279 --> 01:28:48,182
Don't! She's my sister! Don't!

902
01:28:48,282 --> 01:28:52,361
Oh, no! No, please!

903
01:28:57,416 --> 01:28:59,526
Where the hell is Mamuwalde?

904
01:28:59,626 --> 01:29:02,037
I'm here, gentlemen.

905
01:29:07,259 --> 01:29:09,169
Move away from her.

906
01:29:41,877 --> 01:29:43,495
Tina.

907
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,583
My lovely, lovely Tina.

908
01:29:48,842 --> 01:29:51,086
What is left for this
cursed creature?

909
01:29:52,179 --> 01:29:54,881
His only reason for living
has been taken away.

910
01:30:22,626 --> 01:30:23,952
There's no need for that.
