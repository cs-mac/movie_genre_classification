1
00:00:47,755 --> 00:00:53,022
Confounded fog! Makes the matches
so damp, you know.

2
00:00:53,494 --> 00:00:55,519
There we are.

3
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,730
This, of course...

4
00:00:59,534 --> 00:01:01,024
...is London.

5
00:01:01,236 --> 00:01:03,329
And I am William Castle.

6
00:01:03,538 --> 00:01:07,372
It's good to see you again,
my homicidal friends.

7
00:01:07,575 --> 00:01:12,444
This time, our story is
of a different kind.

8
00:01:12,647 --> 00:01:14,842
It's an old-fashioned story.

9
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:16,983
Full of gallantry...

10
00:01:17,185 --> 00:01:19,119
...and graciousness...

11
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,117
...and ghouls.

12
00:01:21,322 --> 00:01:23,153
Do you know about ghouls?

13
00:01:23,358 --> 00:01:24,518
They are...

14
00:01:24,726 --> 00:01:27,854
Well, let me find you
an exact definition.

15
00:01:28,363 --> 00:01:30,388
Let me see...

16
00:01:31,699 --> 00:01:37,035
"Goom," that's an odd word. It means:
"To search for game in the dark."

17
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:38,928
"Ghost..."

18
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,973
Here it is. "Ghoul:

19
00:01:42,176 --> 00:01:46,340
An evil being who robs graves...

20
00:01:46,547 --> 00:01:49,880
...and feeds on corpses."

21
00:01:50,218 --> 00:01:53,676
Ah, yes, just an old-fashioned story.

22
00:01:53,888 --> 00:01:55,480
I hope you enjoy it.

23
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:59,126
I hope your nightmares are nice ones.

24
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:02,125
So nice to have met you again.

25
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,974
Good morning, doctor. Stay, you might
find this interesting.

26
00:03:57,211 --> 00:04:01,011
- Wainwright, apply the heat.
- Yes, Sir Robert.

27
00:04:01,582 --> 00:04:05,518
- Exactly 30 seconds, Wainwright.
- Quite, sir.

28
00:04:08,222 --> 00:04:10,019
That doesn't hurt, does it?

29
00:04:10,224 --> 00:04:12,920
No, doctor. It's nice and warm.

30
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:15,960
- Then we'll resume the massage.
- Good.

31
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:23,835
That's all very well, but Sir Robert
Cargrave can't possibly see you now.

32
00:04:24,038 --> 00:04:25,596
But the letter...

33
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:29,675
My master told me to put it
only in Sir Robert's hand.

34
00:04:29,877 --> 00:04:32,368
- I'll give it to him.
- No, Sir Robert's.

35
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,483
Sir, I will place the letter in Sir
Robert's hands when he is available.

36
00:04:37,685 --> 00:04:40,813
If that doesn't please you,
you can leave.

37
00:04:41,022 --> 00:04:43,889
No, no, no. My master would...

38
00:04:44,091 --> 00:04:46,116
Now, listen...

39
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:49,455
...if I give you the letter,
do you promise...?

40
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,292
I promise I'll place it
in his hand.

41
00:05:27,635 --> 00:05:30,763
Now, young lady,
try doing that yourself.

42
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:33,430
But, doctor, I couldn't.

43
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:38,169
- She's never been able to do that.
- Come, come. You must try.

44
00:06:16,951 --> 00:06:18,282
Good girl.

45
00:06:18,553 --> 00:06:20,487
I did it! I did it!

46
00:06:20,688 --> 00:06:23,486
It worked.
Your treatment worked again!

47
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:24,919
Yes, thank God.

48
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,653
Bless you for this, Sir Robert.

49
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,387
You can take her home.

50
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,567
Keep up the exercises.
I'll see you Tuesday.

51
00:06:34,835 --> 00:06:37,861
Wainwright, let's see
if the post is here.

52
00:06:38,072 --> 00:06:39,403
The post?

53
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:43,202
Oh, yes! The new instrument
from Scotland.

54
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,642
Sir Robert, in yesterday's class,
just before you dismissed us...

55
00:06:50,851 --> 00:06:55,652
...you said something odd about...
- A poison that cures some paralysis?

56
00:06:55,856 --> 00:06:57,221
Nothing odd about it.

57
00:06:57,425 --> 00:07:00,622
Deadly poisons
can sometimes be useful medicines.

58
00:07:00,828 --> 00:07:03,956
- Such as belladonna?
- Quite right. Fatally toxic...

59
00:07:04,165 --> 00:07:06,690
...but good for treating
the optic nerve.

60
00:07:06,901 --> 00:07:10,462
- You weren't referring to belladonna.
- No, it was...

61
00:07:10,671 --> 00:07:13,640
- Is the post here?
- Yes, a number of letters.

62
00:07:13,841 --> 00:07:17,971
- Anything from Scotland?
- Yes, a package from Edinburgh.

63
00:07:18,179 --> 00:07:20,511
- Edinburgh, right.
- Also, there's...

64
00:07:20,715 --> 00:07:22,683
From Dr. Wood.

65
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,218
Here it is.

66
00:07:25,753 --> 00:07:27,721
Look at this, Wainwright.

67
00:07:28,055 --> 00:07:31,582
Originally theorized two
centuries ago or more...

68
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:33,589
...by Dr. Christopher Wren.

69
00:07:33,794 --> 00:07:36,922
Only recently, through work
by Dr. Wood...

70
00:07:37,131 --> 00:07:39,725
...has it at all seemed practical.

71
00:07:39,934 --> 00:07:42,926
- There, isn't that beautiful?
- Very beautiful.

72
00:07:43,137 --> 00:07:47,437
You see, it's nothing more
than a syringe attached to a needle.

73
00:07:47,642 --> 00:07:49,109
An ordinary needle?

74
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:52,643
No, a very extraordinary needle.
A hollow needle.

75
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,042
A hypodermic needle.

76
00:07:55,249 --> 00:08:00,016
"Hypodermic." In other words,
it is meant to puncture the skin.

77
00:08:00,221 --> 00:08:03,918
Delivering drugs directly
and immediately.

78
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:08,391
- Ingenious, sir!
- Key words: "directly," "immediately."

79
00:08:08,596 --> 00:08:10,689
Sir Robert...

80
00:08:10,898 --> 00:08:14,561
Sir Robert, may I call
your attention to a letter...?

81
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:18,603
- Bypassing the digestive system.
- Yes, sir.

82
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,972
- What's this?
- By special messenger.

83
00:08:22,176 --> 00:08:25,077
- It appears to be from the Continent.
- Well...

84
00:08:29,483 --> 00:08:31,280
One moment.

85
00:08:33,287 --> 00:08:37,018
- Could I be alone for a moment?
- Of course, Sir Robert.

86
00:08:37,224 --> 00:08:39,988
I must go at any rate, sir. Goodbye.

87
00:08:40,194 --> 00:08:42,355
Goodbye, Wainwright.

88
00:08:50,604 --> 00:08:55,098
<i>My father forbids our marriage.</i>
<i>He says you're a failure.</i>

89
00:08:55,309 --> 00:08:59,609
<i>I must marry a man of substance,</i>
<i>he says. A wealthy widower.</i>

90
00:09:21,402 --> 00:09:23,267
Sister!

91
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:25,966
You called, Sir Robert?

92
00:09:26,173 --> 00:09:29,074
- Yes. Please do something for me.
- Of course.

93
00:09:29,276 --> 00:09:33,007
- Cancel all my appointments.
- For how long, Sir Robert?

94
00:09:33,214 --> 00:09:34,875
Don't know.
Indefinitely.

95
00:09:35,082 --> 00:09:37,744
And please arrange
transportation to...

96
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,978
...the region of Gorslava,
Central Europe.

97
00:09:41,188 --> 00:09:46,353
Gorslava? Yes, sir.
How soon do you wish to leave?

98
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,425
Soon.

99
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:51,356
As soon as I possibly can.

100
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:42,378
There is no coach that will take
you in that direction.

101
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:46,144
The country up there
is wild and mountainous.

102
00:10:46,353 --> 00:10:48,719
The roads are bad.

103
00:10:48,923 --> 00:10:51,790
Some places, there are
no roads at all.

104
00:10:51,992 --> 00:10:55,086
I was to be met by a private coach.

105
00:10:55,329 --> 00:10:59,732
A private coach, from those parts?
Nobody lives up there.

106
00:11:00,267 --> 00:11:04,829
But I assure you somebody does.
My host, Baron Sardonicus.

107
00:11:05,472 --> 00:11:06,769
Sardonicus?

108
00:11:07,141 --> 00:11:12,204
- Yes. What do you know of him?
- Nothing, sir. I know nothing.

109
00:11:12,413 --> 00:11:15,348
I said nothing against
the baron, did I?

110
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:18,541
No, but hearing
his name frightened you.

111
00:11:19,787 --> 00:11:21,618
No, not at all.

112
00:11:21,822 --> 00:11:24,689
Don't dissemble.
Why were you frightened?

113
00:11:25,593 --> 00:11:30,394
Sir, you would not understand.
You are young.

114
00:11:30,798 --> 00:11:33,961
You do not yet have daughters.

115
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,802
- Sir Robert Cargrave?
- Yes.

116
00:11:41,141 --> 00:11:43,939
I'm called Krull. Your humble servant.

117
00:11:44,144 --> 00:11:47,307
It was I who brought you
the letter weeks ago.

118
00:11:47,514 --> 00:11:49,209
You serve the baroness?

119
00:11:50,217 --> 00:11:54,176
I serve the baron,
who is most eager to meet you.

120
00:11:54,722 --> 00:11:55,711
Shall we go?

121
00:11:57,124 --> 00:11:58,318
Please.

122
00:12:06,734 --> 00:12:08,702
After you, sir.

123
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:20,306
<i>My dear Sir Robert, it has been</i>
<i>a long time since I last saw you.</i>

124
00:13:20,507 --> 00:13:23,533
<i>Will you remember</i>
<i>the former Maude Randall?</i>

125
00:13:23,744 --> 00:13:28,704
<i>I'm married now and live in Gorslava</i>
<i>with my husband, Baron Sardonicus.</i>

126
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:32,044
<i>I've often told him of you</i>
<i>and your researches...</i>

127
00:13:32,252 --> 00:13:35,483
<i>... and recently we've read</i>
<i>of your being knighted.</i>

128
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,055
<i>The baron desires</i>
<i>to meet you.</i>

129
00:13:38,258 --> 00:13:41,853
<i>It is most urgent to my</i>
<i>well-being that he meet you.</i>

130
00:13:42,062 --> 00:13:46,089
<i>Most urgent to my well-being.</i>
<i>Most urgent...</i>

131
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,237
No, not this way.

132
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,246
My God!

133
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:12,516
- What's the meaning of this?
- They're only leeches.

134
00:15:12,719 --> 00:15:16,348
I know what they are, but why?

135
00:15:16,557 --> 00:15:19,617
They're supposed
to cure certain afflictions.

136
00:15:19,827 --> 00:15:22,955
Nonsense. She could've died
or been disfigured!

137
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:27,191
Thank God I saw her in time.

138
00:15:30,704 --> 00:15:33,229
There, that's better.

139
00:15:33,574 --> 00:15:35,542
You'll be all right now.

140
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:47,978
- And what is her "affliction"?
- Her affliction? None, sir.

141
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,685
None? Blast it, man, explain yourself!

142
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,527
Well, she is...

143
00:15:54,728 --> 00:15:58,095
Do you not,
in your own work, make use...

144
00:15:58,298 --> 00:16:00,732
...of what you call guinea pigs?

145
00:16:04,872 --> 00:16:08,137
- At whose bidding was this done?
- The master's.

146
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,505
- Baron Sardonicus?
- There is no other master.

147
00:16:11,945 --> 00:16:14,470
I'll take up the matter with him.

148
00:16:14,681 --> 00:16:17,844
Untie this poor girl.
See that she rests.

149
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:21,248
Give her brandy
and the juice of red meat.

150
00:16:21,455 --> 00:16:23,514
I'll treat her face presently.

151
00:16:23,724 --> 00:16:29,060
Just as you say, Sir Robert.
Now, the baroness awaits you.

152
00:16:31,965 --> 00:16:34,695
The salon is over there.

153
00:16:47,114 --> 00:16:48,911
Robert!

154
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,745
Baroness.

155
00:16:53,287 --> 00:16:57,053
No, please. Call me Maude
as you did in the old days.

156
00:16:57,257 --> 00:17:00,454
These are not the old days, Maude.

157
00:17:00,661 --> 00:17:02,526
That's much better.

158
00:17:02,729 --> 00:17:06,187
Now, come sit down
and tell me all about yourself.

159
00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:10,432
Do you miss London?

160
00:17:10,637 --> 00:17:15,074
We're cozy here. We have all
the current journals and gazettes.

161
00:17:15,342 --> 00:17:19,972
I order fashions from Paris and
musical scores from Rome and Berlin...

162
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:24,549
...all the popular novels. Mr. Conan
Doyle is a fascinating writer.

163
00:17:24,851 --> 00:17:28,947
- Then you do not miss London?
- I did not say that.

164
00:17:29,456 --> 00:17:31,617
But tell me how you've fared.

165
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:35,624
I've fared well.
Perhaps better than I deserve.

166
00:17:35,829 --> 00:17:39,128
My researches have been fruitful.
My name is known.

167
00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:42,698
I've been made a knight
at rather an early age.

168
00:17:43,003 --> 00:17:44,937
And love?

169
00:17:47,507 --> 00:17:51,068
I'm busy, night and day.
The clinic, my classes...

170
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:54,475
...writing papers, experimenting,
making speeches...

171
00:17:54,681 --> 00:17:59,414
Come now, Robert. You're suggesting
that you have no time for love?

172
00:18:02,189 --> 00:18:06,523
- There have been no others, Maude.
- Oh, Robert.

173
00:18:11,064 --> 00:18:15,501
- You must be tired from your journey.
- Yes, and worse for dust.

174
00:18:15,702 --> 00:18:17,499
We'll dine soon.

175
00:18:17,704 --> 00:18:21,299
Krull will show you
to your rooms. You can freshen up.

176
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,701
I will ring for him.

177
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:28,642
- You wish something, my lady?
- Would you show him to his rooms?

178
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:30,311
At once, my lady.

179
00:18:31,385 --> 00:18:34,980
- Until dinner, then.
- Until dinner.

180
00:19:01,648 --> 00:19:04,310
You're puzzled by
the empty frames, sir?

181
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,748
Yes. They do seem rather strange.

182
00:19:06,953 --> 00:19:10,582
The baron is an unusual man,
of unusual convictions.

183
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:15,057
In such frames, others would
honor portraits of their forebears.

184
00:19:15,262 --> 00:19:20,598
But the baron has disowned his
forefathers in one brilliant gesture.

185
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:40,680
Here are your chambers, sir. I trust
you'll find things to your liking.

186
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,280
- If not...
- I'm sure I will.

187
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:46,948
The maidservant. I must treat
the wounds on her face.

188
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,888
She is resting, sir, as you advised.

189
00:19:50,097 --> 00:19:55,433
I've treated her face with hot
compresses and disinfectant tincture.

190
00:19:55,635 --> 00:19:59,401
Excellent. So you are a man
of medicine, Krull?

191
00:20:01,007 --> 00:20:02,907
I'm a man of all work, sir.

192
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:07,638
When my master says, "Krull, do
this thing," I do the thing...

193
00:20:07,848 --> 00:20:09,543
...whatever it may be.

194
00:20:09,983 --> 00:20:13,180
- That's most commendable.
- Thank you, sir.

195
00:20:49,489 --> 00:20:51,582
- Who is it?
- It's Anna, sir.

196
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:57,824
- I must speak to you.
- Just a moment.

197
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,201
It's you. How do you feel?

198
00:21:05,405 --> 00:21:08,169
You won't tell them I spoke
to you, sir?

199
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:11,401
- Very well, but...
- They'd punish me.

200
00:21:11,611 --> 00:21:15,274
Rubbish. But I won't tell them.
What do you want?

201
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:19,543
Sir, you won't let them
do that to me again, will you?

202
00:21:19,753 --> 00:21:22,722
- Promise you won't let them.
- You've my word.

203
00:21:22,956 --> 00:21:25,982
Thank you, sir. Thank you!

204
00:21:26,693 --> 00:21:28,991
- Now that you're here...
- Yes?

205
00:21:29,196 --> 00:21:31,528
Now that you're here, sir...

206
00:21:31,765 --> 00:21:35,997
...maybe the experimenting will stop.
- What do you mean?

207
00:21:37,404 --> 00:21:40,396
No more, sir.
I must not be found here.

208
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,056
I hope the maidservant wasn't
being a nuisance, sir.

209
00:21:58,258 --> 00:22:00,089
No, not at all.

210
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,791
Krull, what is
that padlocked door over there?

211
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:08,296
I can't tell you. Only the master
has been on the other side.

212
00:22:08,502 --> 00:22:10,333
He has the only key.

213
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:14,098
The servants call it
"The Chamber of Horrors."

214
00:22:15,242 --> 00:22:16,903
A jest, sir.

215
00:22:18,078 --> 00:22:20,137
Yes, I'm sure.

216
00:23:23,376 --> 00:23:26,004
You see, we do
very little entertaining.

217
00:23:26,212 --> 00:23:29,045
My husband hates throngs of people.

218
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:32,949
Maude.

219
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,409
Yes.

220
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:37,351
In your letter,
your rather odd letter...

221
00:23:37,557 --> 00:23:41,857
...you said that my presence here
was urgent to your well-being.

222
00:23:42,062 --> 00:23:45,759
- What did you mean?
- Did I say that? How foolish of me.

223
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:50,801
I meant that I longed to be the
hostess again, to see a familiar face.

224
00:23:51,004 --> 00:23:53,973
No, you meant more than that.
But what?

225
00:23:54,507 --> 00:23:56,304
I'm sure I don't know.

226
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:00,773
Very well, but your castle
is no ordinary castle.

227
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:05,042
- People fear your husband...
- Robert, I think you exaggerate.

228
00:24:05,385 --> 00:24:10,084
Perhaps. But I am very anxious
to meet the baron, face to...

229
00:24:14,527 --> 00:24:15,960
Sir Robert Cargrave?

230
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,957
Yes.

231
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,494
I am Baron Sardonicus.

232
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:29,741
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- The pleasure's mine. Let's be seated.

233
00:24:51,197 --> 00:24:55,827
- My mask disturbs you, Sir Robert?
- It'd be foolish of me to deny it.

234
00:24:56,036 --> 00:25:01,338
Quite so. It is an idiosyncrasy
of mine. But necessary, I assure you.

235
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:06,501
Later, I'll tell you the reason.
For now, please sample our poor fare.

236
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,875
Not poor at all. It looks delicious.

237
00:25:11,985 --> 00:25:13,885
But are you not joining us?

238
00:25:14,087 --> 00:25:16,817
Just a little brandy.
I've already dined.

239
00:25:17,023 --> 00:25:21,483
If that will be all, I should attend
to a little servant problem.

240
00:25:21,695 --> 00:25:24,528
- Yes, that will be all.
- Thank you, sir.

241
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:30,067
Sir Robert. Do tell us what's
been happening on the London stage.

242
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,363
Well, let me see...

243
00:25:43,216 --> 00:25:44,581
There you are...

244
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:49,377
...waiting for me
like a good, obedient girl.

245
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:51,853
Krull, please.

246
00:25:52,058 --> 00:25:55,084
But you're not always
obedient, are you?

247
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:01,990
- Please, Krull.
- We must have a little talk, Anna.

248
00:26:02,569 --> 00:26:05,538
You and I,
and some friends of yours.

249
00:26:05,739 --> 00:26:08,003
Some little friends of yours.

250
00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:11,140
No!

251
00:26:12,011 --> 00:26:16,243
- Not the leeches again!
- Let us hope not.

252
00:26:18,852 --> 00:26:21,878
But you see, you're a very
naughty girl.

253
00:26:22,088 --> 00:26:26,354
I forbade you to speak
to Sir Robert, yet you spoke to him.

254
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,254
That is too bad of you.

255
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:31,055
I didn't. I didn't speak to him.

256
00:26:31,264 --> 00:26:34,028
Lies now.
First disobedience, then lies.

257
00:26:34,234 --> 00:26:37,567
Come now. Tell me
what you said to Sir Robert.

258
00:26:37,771 --> 00:26:39,671
I said nothing.

259
00:26:39,873 --> 00:26:42,774
Tell me, or I'll bring
the leeches again.

260
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,501
No. Please, no.

261
00:26:45,712 --> 00:26:48,681
They are so thirsty,
the little fellas.

262
00:26:48,882 --> 00:26:53,285
So thirsty for the sweet nectar
that flows in your veins.

263
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:55,113
Krull, no.

264
00:26:55,321 --> 00:26:58,813
This time, they'll sip not only
from your face.

265
00:26:59,025 --> 00:27:03,519
This time the leeches will get
better acquainted with you.

266
00:27:04,364 --> 00:27:09,529
There are so many of the little
fellows, eager to know you better.

267
00:27:09,736 --> 00:27:13,638
They'll cover you from your face,
down your whole body.

268
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,035
All the way down to your toes.

269
00:27:16,242 --> 00:27:19,405
No! No, you wouldn't.

270
00:27:19,612 --> 00:27:22,342
You wouldn't do that, Krull.

271
00:27:22,916 --> 00:27:26,215
Perhaps it should be reversed?

272
00:27:26,786 --> 00:27:30,882
We should begin with the toes,
and work up.

273
00:27:31,457 --> 00:27:32,583
Yes.

274
00:27:34,494 --> 00:27:36,052
No!

275
00:27:36,396 --> 00:27:37,954
No!

276
00:27:43,503 --> 00:27:45,937
Stop!

277
00:27:47,774 --> 00:27:50,106
I'll tell you! I'll tell you!

278
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:55,670
Seems like an interesting season,
particularly the <i>Macbeth</i> revival.

279
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:59,113
Macbeth is such a totally
evil character, right?

280
00:27:59,452 --> 00:28:03,946
I've never thought so. A man pressed
into evil by circumstances.

281
00:28:04,157 --> 00:28:08,491
But lago, a creature of pure evil,
with no redeeming qualities...

282
00:28:08,695 --> 00:28:11,721
...who tormented Othello
with ghoulish delight...

283
00:28:11,931 --> 00:28:13,558
Ghoulish, you say.

284
00:28:13,766 --> 00:28:18,294
That isn't a term to be used lightly.
A ghoul, I'm sure you know...

285
00:28:18,605 --> 00:28:22,974
...is a disgusting creature who opens
graves and feeds on corpses.

286
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:29,041
- Are you suggesting lago did that?
- Dear, he used the term figuratively.

287
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,648
Perhaps so.

288
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:34,445
The English don't believe
in ghouls, do they?

289
00:28:34,654 --> 00:28:36,485
- Well, I...
- Of course not.

290
00:28:36,689 --> 00:28:40,955
But in my country, we do believe.
In fact, Sir Robert...

291
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:45,620
- In fact, I have known a ghoul.
- Indeed?

292
00:28:45,832 --> 00:28:49,563
You English, nothing shocks you.
You are so blasé.

293
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:52,363
Or can it be that you
don't believe me?

294
00:28:52,572 --> 00:28:55,302
It'd be discourteous
to doubt one's host.

295
00:28:55,508 --> 00:28:59,501
An Englishman may be many things,
but never discourteous.

296
00:28:59,712 --> 00:29:02,306
Let me tell you about this ghoul.

297
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:06,176
- They're here, sir.
- I'll be there presently.

298
00:29:06,386 --> 00:29:08,013
Thank you, sir.

299
00:29:08,421 --> 00:29:12,881
Perhaps we might finish our
discussion on ghouls some other time.

300
00:29:13,092 --> 00:29:16,323
- Of course.
- I have very important visitors...

301
00:29:16,529 --> 00:29:19,555
...if you will forgive me.
- Certainly.

302
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:22,702
Stay together, ladies. I have
a nice little surprise for you.

303
00:29:22,702 --> 00:29:26,934
Stay together, ladies. I have
a nice little surprise for you.

304
00:29:27,407 --> 00:29:31,309
This way, ladies. So come along.

305
00:29:31,511 --> 00:29:34,912
Here we are, all nice and cozy.

306
00:29:35,114 --> 00:29:37,582
The master will be with us presently.

307
00:29:37,784 --> 00:29:40,252
- I beg your pardon, sir.
- Yes?

308
00:29:40,453 --> 00:29:44,287
- You said it was a party.
- Right, a little private party...

309
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:47,050
...with lots of choice food and wine.

310
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:50,423
- Didn't you say something about gold?
- I did.

311
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,825
A piece of gold for each.

312
00:29:53,032 --> 00:29:55,432
And for the lucky one, even more.

313
00:29:55,635 --> 00:29:59,196
- The lucky one?
- That's right, the lucky one.

314
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:11,641
Charming to meet you. Good of you
to accept my invitation.

315
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:15,378
I trust we'll enjoy one another's
company tonight.

316
00:30:15,588 --> 00:30:19,183
Wine is a wondrous bounty. A blessing.

317
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:22,084
There is a wine for every mood.

318
00:30:22,328 --> 00:30:23,955
There is champagne...

319
00:30:24,163 --> 00:30:25,926
...gay and carefree.

320
00:30:26,132 --> 00:30:27,724
Then there is claret...

321
00:30:27,934 --> 00:30:31,199
...full-bodied and richly satisfying.

322
00:30:38,611 --> 00:30:41,603
Then we have the wine of Portugal...

323
00:30:41,948 --> 00:30:43,939
...dark and sensuous...

324
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:46,675
...and thick as blood.

325
00:30:48,921 --> 00:30:50,411
As with wine...

326
00:30:50,623 --> 00:30:52,147
...so with women.

327
00:30:54,594 --> 00:30:55,526
This way.

328
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:57,320
No, that's it.

329
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,498
That's it.

330
00:31:05,271 --> 00:31:07,535
For every mood.

331
00:31:08,174 --> 00:31:09,300
Dark.

332
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:10,533
Saucy.

333
00:31:12,045 --> 00:31:13,239
Slender.

334
00:31:13,446 --> 00:31:14,344
Buxom.

335
00:31:15,648 --> 00:31:16,546
And fair.

336
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,275
And for tonight...

337
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:20,817
This one.

338
00:31:22,188 --> 00:31:24,452
Pay the others and dismiss them.

339
00:31:24,657 --> 00:31:26,215
Come, ladies. This way.

340
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,825
Come on, come on.

341
00:31:28,027 --> 00:31:30,257
No, not you. You stay here.

342
00:31:32,031 --> 00:31:35,296
My journey has fatigued me
more than I thought.

343
00:31:35,501 --> 00:31:36,729
I should retire.

344
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,632
Of course. I understand.

345
00:31:40,139 --> 00:31:41,606
And Robert?

346
00:31:42,175 --> 00:31:43,233
Yes?

347
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:47,675
You were right. Your presence
is most urgent to my well-being.

348
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,347
Most urgent.

349
00:31:49,549 --> 00:31:50,948
But what...?

350
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,515
Not now.

351
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:54,116
Good night.

352
00:31:55,388 --> 00:31:56,878
Good night, Maude.

353
00:32:02,829 --> 00:32:05,297
You are a very pretty little thing.

354
00:32:05,498 --> 00:32:06,692
Thank you, sir.

355
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:09,925
And a very shy little thing.

356
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:11,861
Well, sir...

357
00:32:12,071 --> 00:32:15,632
...I've never known a fine gentleman
like yourself.

358
00:32:15,842 --> 00:32:18,072
Do you find me pleasant?

359
00:32:18,711 --> 00:32:20,542
Yes, sir. Only...

360
00:32:20,746 --> 00:32:21,872
Only what?

361
00:32:22,281 --> 00:32:23,270
Well, sir...

362
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:27,579
...you would be much more pleasant
without that funny mask.

363
00:32:29,589 --> 00:32:30,749
A nice little girl.

364
00:32:30,957 --> 00:32:32,584
No!

365
00:32:45,972 --> 00:32:48,372
<i>You would not understand.</i>

366
00:32:48,641 --> 00:32:50,472
<i>You are young.</i>

367
00:32:50,877 --> 00:32:52,674
<i>You do not yet have...</i>

368
00:32:52,879 --> 00:32:54,574
<i>... daughters.</i>

369
00:32:54,981 --> 00:32:57,347
<i>Now that you are here, sir...</i>

370
00:32:57,817 --> 00:33:01,116
<i>... maybe the experimenting will stop.</i>

371
00:33:02,455 --> 00:33:04,980
<i>I'm a man of all work, sir.</i>

372
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:08,058
<i>When my master says, "Do this thing"...</i>

373
00:33:08,261 --> 00:33:09,819
<i>... I do the thing.</i>

374
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,963
<i>Whatever it may be.</i>

375
00:33:21,607 --> 00:33:23,871
<i>Most urgent to my well-being.</i>

376
00:33:24,076 --> 00:33:26,408
<i>Most urgent to my well-being.</i>

377
00:33:26,612 --> 00:33:29,206
<i>Most urgent. Most urgent.</i>

378
00:33:29,415 --> 00:33:31,280
<i>Most urgent...</i>

379
00:33:31,484 --> 00:33:33,645
<i>I have known a ghoul.</i>

380
00:33:33,853 --> 00:33:36,788
<i>A disgusting creature</i>
<i>who opens graves...</i>

381
00:33:36,989 --> 00:33:39,287
<i>... and feeds on corpses.</i>

382
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,974
- Good morning, Sir Robert.
- Good morning.

383
00:35:04,176 --> 00:35:08,112
- May I know your breakfast preference?
- Anything at all.

384
00:35:08,381 --> 00:35:10,178
Can you bring me a mirror?

385
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,475
A mirror, Sir Robert?

386
00:35:13,686 --> 00:35:15,677
Yes, so that I can shave.

387
00:35:16,255 --> 00:35:18,746
I fear there are no mirrors.

388
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:20,620
No mirrors?

389
00:35:20,826 --> 00:35:24,387
None in the entire castle.
The baron's orders.

390
00:35:24,597 --> 00:35:26,258
But why not?

391
00:35:26,465 --> 00:35:29,195
It is not my place to question.

392
00:35:29,735 --> 00:35:32,363
Will you be coming down
to breakfast soon?

393
00:35:33,306 --> 00:35:35,365
Yes, presently.

394
00:35:35,574 --> 00:35:37,041
Very good, sir.

395
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,201
- Good morning, madam.
- Good morning.

396
00:36:10,409 --> 00:36:12,138
- May I come in?
- Well, I...

397
00:36:12,345 --> 00:36:16,406
Don't worry. I'm not a man who is
affectionate in the morning.

398
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:19,716
This morning I intend to tell him
everything.

399
00:36:19,919 --> 00:36:23,980
That's right. You were interrupted
last night by your visitors.

400
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,282
That is correct.

401
00:36:25,491 --> 00:36:28,619
What was she like,
the one who screamed?

402
00:36:28,828 --> 00:36:30,523
Don't let us have a scene.

403
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:35,394
I merely wished to inform you your
precious Sir Robert will know all...

404
00:36:35,601 --> 00:36:37,660
...and he will make his decision.

405
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:41,169
If it's the wrong choice,
you know what to expect.

406
00:36:41,774 --> 00:36:43,264
No, you wouldn't.

407
00:36:43,476 --> 00:36:46,707
Oh, but I would. I would, indeed.

408
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,647
It would be in your best interest...

409
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:53,478
...to persuade him
to the right decision.

410
00:36:53,686 --> 00:36:57,349
- How persuade him?
- How do women usually persuade men?

411
00:36:57,556 --> 00:37:00,081
Exactly what do you imply, sir?

412
00:37:00,292 --> 00:37:03,523
Imply? Cowards imply. I command.

413
00:37:03,729 --> 00:37:08,325
And I command you to sway him
by any and every means in your power.

414
00:37:09,335 --> 00:37:10,495
Use your...

415
00:37:10,703 --> 00:37:15,037
I believe they're usually
referred to as "charms."

416
00:37:20,646 --> 00:37:23,979
And that pain, madam,
was only a sample.

417
00:37:30,523 --> 00:37:33,754
I thought we'd walk in my garden
before breakfast.

418
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:36,450
It is a strange garden. No flowers.

419
00:37:36,662 --> 00:37:38,789
Flowers grow poorly here.

420
00:37:38,998 --> 00:37:42,525
Only Earth's ugly children flourish.
The weeds.

421
00:37:42,735 --> 00:37:46,262
Here you'll find plants
read about in romantic tales:

422
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:50,169
Wolfbane, mandrake root, hemlock,
deadly nightshade.

423
00:37:50,376 --> 00:37:52,310
They are all here.

424
00:37:52,545 --> 00:37:55,070
Krull will announce breakfast shortly.

425
00:37:55,281 --> 00:37:58,216
I thought in the interim
we might talk.

426
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:02,879
- Shall we be seated?
- I'd like to speak of several matters.

427
00:38:03,088 --> 00:38:05,818
Perhaps I'll resume my story
of the ghoul?

428
00:38:06,025 --> 00:38:09,051
There are other things
I'd like to speak of.

429
00:38:10,229 --> 00:38:13,062
Screams in the night and other sounds.

430
00:38:13,265 --> 00:38:15,256
A girl, tortured by leeches.

431
00:38:15,468 --> 00:38:18,835
Yes, you are right
to question these things.

432
00:38:19,038 --> 00:38:22,030
If you listen to my story
you'll learn all.

433
00:38:22,241 --> 00:38:24,903
You'll learn the answer
to these mysteries.

434
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:27,977
Also, how low a human being can sink.

435
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,115
You'll learn the story
of my first wife...

436
00:38:31,317 --> 00:38:34,115
...who died because of a ghoul.

437
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:36,753
My name was not always Sardonicus...

438
00:38:36,956 --> 00:38:39,151
...and I did not always wear a mask.

439
00:38:40,926 --> 00:38:42,985
<i>I was a peasant named Marek.</i>

440
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:46,289
<i>My mother had been dead only a year.</i>

441
00:38:48,167 --> 00:38:49,634
Ah, Henryk...

442
00:38:49,835 --> 00:38:51,803
...it's only you and your son.

443
00:38:52,004 --> 00:38:54,905
We've come to pay our respects
to my wife.

444
00:38:55,107 --> 00:38:56,802
She was a good woman.

445
00:38:57,009 --> 00:38:59,705
A better never walked the earth.

446
00:39:01,146 --> 00:39:03,614
My eyes are not what they were...

447
00:39:03,816 --> 00:39:05,807
...and when I saw two men...

448
00:39:06,018 --> 00:39:09,249
...standing over a grave at dusk...

449
00:39:09,455 --> 00:39:12,549
As a gravedigger I have
responsibilities...

450
00:39:12,758 --> 00:39:14,055
...and I thought...

451
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,319
You thought what, my friend?

452
00:39:16,529 --> 00:39:19,965
It may have been
those lowest of men.

453
00:39:20,165 --> 00:39:21,928
If you can call them men.

454
00:39:22,134 --> 00:39:24,864
- You mean the...
- Yes, the ghouls.

455
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:29,507
- They're stories to scare children.
- No, young Marek.

456
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:31,437
Ask your father here.

457
00:39:31,644 --> 00:39:34,636
We old ones know that ghouls exist.

458
00:39:34,847 --> 00:39:37,008
We've seen them prowl at night...

459
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:39,707
...and open the graves
of our loved ones.

460
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,945
Creatures that once were men...

461
00:39:43,155 --> 00:39:45,089
...even as you and I...

462
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:48,988
...sunk so low that they do that.

463
00:39:49,662 --> 00:39:51,789
You are upsetting my son.

464
00:39:51,997 --> 00:39:53,897
Come, Marek. Let's go home.

465
00:39:54,099 --> 00:39:57,068
Your wife, Elenka, will be waiting.

466
00:39:58,237 --> 00:40:01,001
I have a present for her.

467
00:40:02,308 --> 00:40:05,175
Marek, never fear.

468
00:40:05,377 --> 00:40:08,972
I will guard your mother well
against the ghouls.

469
00:40:09,181 --> 00:40:12,309
They will never violate her grave.

470
00:40:26,565 --> 00:40:30,126
- What present do you have for Elenka?
- Wait and see.

471
00:40:30,336 --> 00:40:34,295
She's fond of pretty clothes
and trinkets, things I can't afford.

472
00:40:34,506 --> 00:40:37,441
I know. That is why I...

473
00:40:39,511 --> 00:40:41,069
Oh, Elenka!

474
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,841
Well, there you are.
Took you long enough.

475
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,483
Is our meal ready?

476
00:40:46,685 --> 00:40:50,143
I have eaten. You can
heat up what's left.

477
00:40:50,356 --> 00:40:52,756
Doesn't matter. I'm not hungry.

478
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:55,756
- Elenka, my little one.
- What?

479
00:40:55,961 --> 00:40:59,397
When I was in the city,
I bought you something...

480
00:40:59,598 --> 00:41:02,396
...that might make you very happy.

481
00:41:02,601 --> 00:41:05,661
- You did?
- Yes. Let me see.

482
00:41:08,641 --> 00:41:09,608
Of course!

483
00:41:09,808 --> 00:41:13,471
I wore that weskit my wife made for me
before she died.

484
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,579
It's in the pocket.

485
00:41:15,781 --> 00:41:17,373
But what is it?

486
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:21,580
But what is it?

487
00:41:21,787 --> 00:41:22,947
Be patient.

488
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:29,919
Here it is!

489
00:41:32,064 --> 00:41:34,464
Father, a lottery ticket again?

490
00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:37,568
- Yes, but this one...
- Is different, I know.

491
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:38,964
It is different!

492
00:41:39,171 --> 00:41:40,866
You silly, old man!

493
00:41:41,073 --> 00:41:43,769
How many lottery tickets
have you bought?

494
00:41:43,976 --> 00:41:46,240
Many. Perhaps hundreds.

495
00:41:46,445 --> 00:41:48,936
And how many times have you won?

496
00:41:49,148 --> 00:41:51,048
Never. But this time...

497
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:53,946
That's what you always say.
"This time."

498
00:41:54,153 --> 00:41:55,882
Yes, I know...

499
00:41:56,088 --> 00:41:58,750
...but this time is truly different.

500
00:41:58,957 --> 00:42:00,549
I feel it here.

501
00:42:00,759 --> 00:42:04,593
Because this time
it is for you and Marek.

502
00:42:04,797 --> 00:42:05,889
Thank you, Father.

503
00:42:06,098 --> 00:42:09,124
I have never heard of anything
so ridiculous.

504
00:42:12,438 --> 00:42:15,373
<i>It was the last time I saw him alive.</i>

505
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:20,238
<i>For that very night, peacefully</i>
<i>in his sleep, he left us.</i>

506
00:42:41,467 --> 00:42:43,799
<i>The following months were hard.</i>

507
00:42:44,002 --> 00:42:47,995
<i>Elenka and I quarreled,</i>
<i>always over the same thing.</i>

508
00:42:48,207 --> 00:42:49,196
<i>Money.</i>

509
00:42:49,408 --> 00:42:53,242
What's the use? It's always the same.
I sell our produce...

510
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:56,312
...then spend all the profits
on seed grain.

511
00:42:56,515 --> 00:42:58,915
You'd get a good price for the farm.

512
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:01,484
Sell my father's farm? No.

513
00:43:01,687 --> 00:43:03,450
Even if I did, what then?

514
00:43:03,655 --> 00:43:08,354
- Go to the city and rent a big house.
- We'd be poor in half a year.

515
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,858
For half a year of luxury, yes!

516
00:43:11,063 --> 00:43:13,156
It would be better than this!

517
00:43:13,365 --> 00:43:14,389
Who is it?

518
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,228
Marek, open up!

519
00:43:17,436 --> 00:43:18,869
Janku.

520
00:43:19,371 --> 00:43:21,771
Marek, my old friend!

521
00:43:26,178 --> 00:43:28,806
Your friend is drunk.

522
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:32,682
I? Drunk?

523
00:43:32,885 --> 00:43:36,787
Just had three or four glasses.
Three or four glasses.

524
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,581
Been to the city?

525
00:43:38,791 --> 00:43:42,352
Yes, I have, and I have
great news for you.

526
00:43:42,561 --> 00:43:44,756
Great news for my old friend!

527
00:43:44,963 --> 00:43:47,193
- What news?
- News of money!

528
00:43:48,634 --> 00:43:49,931
- Money?
- Yes, money!

529
00:43:50,135 --> 00:43:53,593
Lots and lots of money.

530
00:43:53,806 --> 00:43:56,240
For heaven's sake, what do you mean?

531
00:43:58,744 --> 00:44:01,110
- I mean this.
- What is it?

532
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:05,108
- The winners!
- The winners?

533
00:44:05,317 --> 00:44:08,514
Yes, the lottery. The lottery winners!

534
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,709
The lottery!

535
00:44:09,922 --> 00:44:13,323
Yes. See, there's a number.
And there's your father's name.

536
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:14,753
And next to it...

537
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:19,454
...you see the numbers 7-7-0-7.

538
00:44:19,665 --> 00:44:21,690
7-7-0-7!

539
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,027
That's right! That was it!

540
00:44:24,269 --> 00:44:26,260
You mean your father's ticket?

541
00:44:26,471 --> 00:44:29,963
Yes, it has won hundreds,
maybe thousands!

542
00:44:30,175 --> 00:44:31,472
How glorious!

543
00:44:31,677 --> 00:44:34,737
Tomorrow I'll go to the city
and redeem the...

544
00:44:35,147 --> 00:44:37,980
- What is it?
- Where is the ticket?

545
00:45:25,564 --> 00:45:27,828
- What is it?
- The weskit.

546
00:45:28,033 --> 00:45:29,762
- What weskit?
- My father's.

547
00:45:29,968 --> 00:45:32,436
- What about it?
- The one my mother made.

548
00:45:32,638 --> 00:45:33,866
What about it?

549
00:45:34,072 --> 00:45:35,801
He was buried in it.

550
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,939
What difference does it make?

551
00:45:38,143 --> 00:45:39,542
The ticket.

552
00:45:40,445 --> 00:45:41,844
What?

553
00:45:42,047 --> 00:45:44,413
The ticket was in the pocket.

554
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:48,719
I'll go now.

555
00:45:55,527 --> 00:45:57,495
- Marek.
- Yes.

556
00:45:57,696 --> 00:46:01,132
Did you say the ticket
was in the pocket?

557
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:02,265
Yes.

558
00:46:04,436 --> 00:46:07,200
Not was, Marek. Is.

559
00:46:07,406 --> 00:46:10,933
- The ticket is in the pocket.
- What are you saying?

560
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:14,078
- It's as clear as daylight.
- What are you saying?

561
00:46:14,279 --> 00:46:15,940
It's the only way!

562
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,911
May God forgive you.

563
00:46:18,517 --> 00:46:20,951
You have said that you love me.

564
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:23,553
This is your chance to prove it.

565
00:46:23,755 --> 00:46:26,622
Please, Elenka,
don't put it like that.

566
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,789
Prove it!

567
00:46:34,132 --> 00:46:38,228
<i>And so that night I became</i>
<i>a profaner of the dead.</i>

568
00:46:38,537 --> 00:46:40,562
<i>A robber of graves.</i>

569
00:46:40,772 --> 00:46:42,171
<i>A ghoul.</i>

570
00:47:10,769 --> 00:47:12,634
Forgive me, Father.

571
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:52,828
<i>I had not foreseen</i>
<i>that the face of my father...</i>

572
00:48:53,038 --> 00:48:55,836
<i>... the muscles stretched</i>
<i>by a terrible death rigor...</i>

573
00:48:56,041 --> 00:48:58,441
<i>... would look directly upon me...</i>

574
00:48:58,643 --> 00:49:00,270
<i>... the dead lips drawn back...</i>

575
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:03,312
<i>... in a constant,</i>
<i>soul-shattering smile.</i>

576
00:49:04,116 --> 00:49:07,950
<i>Suddenly I realized I had not</i>
<i>performed my ghastly mission.</i>

577
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:11,179
<i>The ticket remained</i>
<i>in my father's pocket.</i>

578
00:50:03,408 --> 00:50:05,706
Marek, is that you?

579
00:50:07,312 --> 00:50:08,939
Did you get it?

580
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,781
Was it bad?

581
00:50:16,922 --> 00:50:19,322
Are you all right, my darling?

582
00:50:20,425 --> 00:50:22,256
Is something wrong?

583
00:50:22,494 --> 00:50:24,758
Wait, I'll light the candle.

584
00:50:36,675 --> 00:50:38,336
Merciful God!

585
00:50:38,543 --> 00:50:40,204
Ever since that night...

586
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:42,903
...my face has been as you see it now.

587
00:50:43,114 --> 00:50:45,605
A replica of my dead father's.

588
00:50:45,817 --> 00:50:49,184
The lips drawn back
in a perpetual mocking grin.

589
00:50:49,387 --> 00:50:51,548
I'm unable to close my mouth.

590
00:50:51,756 --> 00:50:53,656
The muscles are immovable...

591
00:50:53,858 --> 00:50:56,725
...as if held in the rigor of death.

592
00:50:57,295 --> 00:50:58,762
Incredible.

593
00:50:58,964 --> 00:51:01,660
Yet your power of speech
seems unimpaired.

594
00:51:01,866 --> 00:51:04,096
But it was. Very much impaired.

595
00:51:04,302 --> 00:51:06,930
For a long time I could hardly speak.

596
00:51:07,138 --> 00:51:11,097
Only through training by the
finest teachers of diction...

597
00:51:11,309 --> 00:51:12,571
...did I finally master...

598
00:51:12,777 --> 00:51:16,110
...the use of dormant muscles
in the throat and palate.

599
00:51:16,314 --> 00:51:19,909
I literally learned to speak
all over again.

600
00:51:27,259 --> 00:51:30,126
Through the years,
I evolved an explanation...

601
00:51:30,328 --> 00:51:31,761
...for my affliction.

602
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:34,830
At first, my superstitious
peasant mind...

603
00:51:35,033 --> 00:51:37,365
...believed Heaven had cursed me...

604
00:51:37,569 --> 00:51:40,595
...to punish me for violating
my father's rest.

605
00:51:40,805 --> 00:51:45,003
Or that some devilish force
had reached out to stamp my face.

606
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:49,977
But I began to believe it was the
massive shock that caused it.

607
00:51:50,181 --> 00:51:54,584
That my guilt also helped shape it
as that of my dead father.

608
00:51:55,453 --> 00:51:56,886
Shock and guilt.

609
00:51:57,088 --> 00:51:58,749
Strong powers...

610
00:51:58,957 --> 00:52:01,949
...not from God above
nor the fiend below...

611
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,789
...but from within my own heart,
my own brain...

612
00:52:06,364 --> 00:52:07,763
...my own soul.

613
00:52:07,966 --> 00:52:09,399
Your wife, Elenka...

614
00:52:09,601 --> 00:52:12,593
She died. By her own hand.

615
00:52:12,804 --> 00:52:14,567
You did redeem the ticket?

616
00:52:14,773 --> 00:52:18,834
Obviously. And bought myself
the resounding title of baron.

617
00:52:19,044 --> 00:52:20,068
And your name?

618
00:52:20,278 --> 00:52:24,612
You're a medical man. Surely you
recognize the term <i>sardonicus</i>?

619
00:52:24,816 --> 00:52:29,583
Yes, the Latin term for the grimace
on the faces of lockjaw victims.

620
00:52:30,322 --> 00:52:32,483
<i>Risus sardonicus.</i>

621
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:34,124
"Sardonic smile."

622
00:52:34,326 --> 00:52:39,127
In my blighted condition, I took
a great interest in the medical arts.

623
00:52:39,331 --> 00:52:41,231
I read a great deal.

624
00:52:41,433 --> 00:52:44,800
In my reading,
I came across that term.

625
00:52:45,003 --> 00:52:49,804
The bitter irony of it appealed to me,
and I took Sardonicus as my name.

626
00:52:50,475 --> 00:52:52,807
Does my story answer your questions?

627
00:52:53,011 --> 00:52:57,414
It answers many questions.
The strange sounds of eating I heard.

628
00:52:57,615 --> 00:53:02,143
I can eat only the thinnest stews
and porridges, sucking like a beast.

629
00:53:02,354 --> 00:53:05,289
The sight is so offensive,
I always eat alone.

630
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:06,388
The leeches?

631
00:53:06,591 --> 00:53:07,785
I tried everything.

632
00:53:07,992 --> 00:53:11,928
In despair, I allowed Krull
to test a folk remedy on the girl.

633
00:53:12,464 --> 00:53:13,453
And the mirrors?

634
00:53:13,965 --> 00:53:18,902
If you had my face, your house
would be devoid of mirrors too.

635
00:53:20,538 --> 00:53:22,005
Yes, I understand.

636
00:53:22,207 --> 00:53:26,109
- You understand why I brought you?
- Because of my researches.

637
00:53:26,311 --> 00:53:30,213
And your successes
that earned you a knighthood.

638
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:33,714
I have visited famous doctors
all over the world.

639
00:53:33,918 --> 00:53:36,478
Keller in Berlin, Morignac in Paris...

640
00:53:36,688 --> 00:53:37,848
...Buonagente in Milan.

641
00:53:38,056 --> 00:53:39,489
All great men.

642
00:53:39,691 --> 00:53:43,491
None have been able to help me.
You are my last hope.

643
00:53:43,695 --> 00:53:47,461
I beseech you to help me,
to lift this curse from me...

644
00:53:47,665 --> 00:53:50,190
...to make me look once more
like a man...

645
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:54,163
...that I may take my place
among fellow humans...

646
00:53:54,372 --> 00:53:59,002
...rather than as a gargoyle to be
shunned and feared and ridiculed.

647
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:01,041
You were right to ask me.

648
00:54:01,246 --> 00:54:05,376
We must never abandon hope.
I can begin treatment this afternoon.

649
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,257
Come on, hurry up.

650
00:54:20,265 --> 00:54:21,926
Put it there.

651
00:54:44,889 --> 00:54:47,153
- Robert.
- Maude.

652
00:54:47,358 --> 00:54:52,159
Cure him. Oh, cure him, Robert.
If you fail, I will suffer.

653
00:54:52,363 --> 00:54:56,595
- A wife could feel no other way.
- No, you don't understand.

654
00:54:56,801 --> 00:54:59,395
If you do not heal him,
he'll punish me.

655
00:54:59,737 --> 00:55:01,967
Surely he wouldn't beat you.

656
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:05,199
I wish he'd be content
with a mere beating.

657
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:08,902
- He knows more hideous torture.
- It's monstrous! I'll demand...

658
00:55:09,113 --> 00:55:10,410
No, say nothing!

659
00:55:10,615 --> 00:55:13,243
If you do, he may embellish
the punishment.

660
00:55:13,451 --> 00:55:16,818
- But what manner of...?
- No. Say nothing.

661
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:20,157
He's waiting for you.

662
00:55:38,776 --> 00:55:40,710
- You are ready?
- Yes, Sir Robert.

663
00:55:40,912 --> 00:55:43,403
Remain here.
I'll need your assistance.

664
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:45,583
What form will treatment take?

665
00:55:45,917 --> 00:55:48,909
Repeated application of heat
and massage.

666
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,054
They've been tried and failed.

667
00:55:51,256 --> 00:55:52,985
Massages differ.

668
00:55:53,191 --> 00:55:56,524
I've had success with my techniques
and have faith.

669
00:55:57,128 --> 00:55:58,823
Share my faith.

670
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:01,828
I do. I must.

671
00:56:04,836 --> 00:56:06,599
Let us begin.

672
00:56:08,606 --> 00:56:10,233
Remove the mask.

673
00:56:13,144 --> 00:56:14,509
Towel.

674
00:56:29,527 --> 00:56:33,019
Thirty seconds, Krull.
No more, no less.

675
00:56:35,833 --> 00:56:37,323
Yes, sir.

676
00:57:04,028 --> 00:57:06,053
Thirty seconds, Sir Robert.

677
00:58:15,433 --> 00:58:17,628
What remains to be done?

678
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:21,468
Nothing. I won't deceive you...

679
00:58:21,673 --> 00:58:24,198
...I've done all I can. It's hopeless.

680
00:58:25,109 --> 00:58:27,134
- I can do no more.
- You must!

681
00:58:27,345 --> 00:58:29,142
- I'm sorry.
- Resume treatment!

682
00:58:29,347 --> 00:58:33,147
That would be futile.
I've worked well into the night!

683
00:58:35,453 --> 00:58:37,045
Leave us, Krull.

684
00:58:39,824 --> 00:58:42,190
Surely there are other treatments?

685
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:46,352
None that have been
sufficiently tested on humans.

686
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:48,896
Then other possibilities do exist?

687
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:51,796
Only in the experimental stages.

688
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:55,933
I implore you to use
whatever treatments remain...

689
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:57,835
...however untried.

690
00:58:58,042 --> 00:59:00,237
They are fraught with danger.

691
00:59:00,445 --> 00:59:03,005
I am ready to gamble with my life.

692
00:59:03,214 --> 00:59:04,738
But I am not!

693
00:59:04,949 --> 00:59:07,941
I will offer you 10,000 crowns.

694
00:59:08,152 --> 00:59:10,245
It's not a question of money.

695
00:59:10,455 --> 00:59:14,255
20,000! 30,000!
Whatever you may desire.

696
00:59:14,859 --> 00:59:16,053
No.

697
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:19,893
Very well, then I must ask you
to come with me.

698
00:59:41,819 --> 00:59:44,379
- Where are you taking me?
- Patience.

699
00:59:44,589 --> 00:59:47,023
All will be made clear to you soon.

700
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:50,719
This castle is very old.

701
00:59:50,928 --> 00:59:54,591
It was built in a dim age
of fearful barbarity.

702
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:08,544
This is the torture chamber
of the castle.

703
01:00:23,795 --> 01:00:25,285
Maude!

704
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:27,263
What have you done?

705
01:00:27,465 --> 01:00:29,296
Nothing. Yet.

706
01:00:29,534 --> 01:00:33,868
You must know first that I am
the victim of a domestic tragedy.

707
01:00:34,071 --> 01:00:36,266
My wife does not love me.

708
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:40,841
She has always been a wife in name
only. She is revolted, you see.

709
01:00:41,045 --> 01:00:44,037
- Revolted by my face.
- It's not only that.

710
01:00:44,248 --> 01:00:47,843
Come, madam! My crudeness,
my cruelty, my arrogance?

711
01:00:48,052 --> 01:00:51,351
You tell yourself this
in your womanish fashion.

712
01:00:51,556 --> 01:00:55,458
But it's my face you bar your door
against, not my character.

713
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:59,994
If I'm pushed to my limits,
if you do not cure me...

714
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:04,828
...I'll be forced to make myself
acceptable to her by extreme measure.

715
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:07,163
- By torture?
- I'd gain nothing.

716
01:01:07,371 --> 01:01:10,306
I merely wish to detain her
in this chair...

717
01:01:10,508 --> 01:01:12,772
...while she undergoes surgery.

718
01:01:12,977 --> 01:01:13,966
Surgery?

719
01:01:14,178 --> 01:01:18,774
Yes. Surgery which will make her more
sympathetic to my plight.

720
01:01:18,983 --> 01:01:22,316
For this purpose, I've enlisted
the services of a man...

721
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:24,215
...who excels at surgery.

722
01:01:24,422 --> 01:01:25,719
You mean me?

723
01:01:26,023 --> 01:01:29,288
No. Someone with quite different
talents.

724
01:01:29,493 --> 01:01:32,792
In point of fact, he stands behind me.

725
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:35,563
Krull! He's no man of medicine.

726
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:38,364
I'm a man of all work, sir.

727
01:01:38,703 --> 01:01:42,764
When my master says, "Do this thing,"
I do the thing.

728
01:01:42,974 --> 01:01:44,373
Whatever it may be.

729
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:47,043
I seem to remember you saying...

730
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:50,146
...that this was most commendable.

731
01:01:50,948 --> 01:01:55,351
- What devilish surgery do you plan?
- Something quite simple, really.

732
01:01:55,553 --> 01:02:00,354
The risorius muscle, that which
controls the act of smiling.

733
01:02:00,558 --> 01:02:03,425
A few deft incisions
with a sharp knife...

734
01:02:03,628 --> 01:02:06,392
...and Maude will look like me.

735
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:07,621
No!

736
01:02:07,832 --> 01:02:10,426
That lovely face will resemble mine.

737
01:02:10,635 --> 01:02:14,298
When her own beauty
is transformed into hideousness...

738
01:02:14,505 --> 01:02:18,202
...when she herself is a monster
shunned by humankind...

739
01:02:18,409 --> 01:02:21,435
...how can she then
bar her door to me?

740
01:02:21,646 --> 01:02:22,578
Krull...

741
01:02:23,214 --> 01:02:24,681
...begin.

742
01:02:52,343 --> 01:02:57,280
Forgive me for tying you to the rack,
but I don't wish to break your bones.

743
01:02:57,481 --> 01:03:01,008
I simply felt it was the best
vantage point to watch.

744
01:03:01,218 --> 01:03:04,119
I did not proceed
while you were unconscious.

745
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:06,654
That would have been most impolite.

746
01:03:06,857 --> 01:03:09,189
Don't do it, Sardonicus.

747
01:03:09,727 --> 01:03:11,524
Don't do it, I beg of you.

748
01:03:11,729 --> 01:03:15,893
You beg, just as I begged
in my chambers. Do you recall?

749
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:20,434
I begged you to try the new treatment
on me and you refused.

750
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:25,135
Krull, you may begin.

751
01:03:27,111 --> 01:03:28,203
Master.

752
01:03:28,412 --> 01:03:30,073
Yes?

753
01:03:31,082 --> 01:03:34,745
I have done many things for you.

754
01:03:35,252 --> 01:03:37,516
Things out of nightmares.

755
01:03:38,422 --> 01:03:39,889
But her face...

756
01:03:40,091 --> 01:03:41,991
What about her face?

757
01:03:43,094 --> 01:03:45,119
It is...

758
01:03:45,329 --> 01:03:47,092
...so beautiful.

759
01:03:47,298 --> 01:03:48,856
Are you quite certain?

760
01:03:49,066 --> 01:03:51,296
Yes, I'm quite certain.

761
01:03:51,502 --> 01:03:53,732
Don't tell me that you object.

762
01:03:54,238 --> 01:03:55,637
I only meant...

763
01:03:55,840 --> 01:04:00,675
Because you well know what happens
to people who raise objections.

764
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:05,781
You know what happened the one time
you questioned me years ago.

765
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:11,321
Or have you forgotten
that once you had two eyes?

766
01:04:15,092 --> 01:04:16,389
No.

767
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:18,218
I have not forgotten.

768
01:04:18,596 --> 01:04:20,427
Then begin.

769
01:04:38,115 --> 01:04:40,982
Don't do it! Don't destroy her face!

770
01:04:50,594 --> 01:04:51,822
Stop it!

771
01:04:52,029 --> 01:04:53,291
Stop it, Krull!

772
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:56,657
Sardonicus...

773
01:04:58,903 --> 01:05:02,066
...I'll do whatever you say.

774
01:05:02,706 --> 01:05:07,166
Release the baroness, Krull.
Then release our honored guest.

775
01:05:07,611 --> 01:05:11,047
You have made a very wise decision,
Sir Robert.

776
01:05:30,067 --> 01:05:31,534
Robert?

777
01:05:34,705 --> 01:05:36,866
Can you really cure him?

778
01:05:37,842 --> 01:05:39,332
I don't know.

779
01:05:39,543 --> 01:05:42,171
It's a dangerous, untried treatment.

780
01:05:42,379 --> 01:05:46,213
I'll have to send for drugs
and equipment from far-off places.

781
01:08:11,762 --> 01:08:16,358
- I have asked not to be disturbed.
- Are you making progress?

782
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:20,266
- Perhaps.
- I saw Krull and a dog.

783
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:23,099
You'll see many dogs
before I'm finished.

784
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:26,174
Are you preparing a cure or a poison?

785
01:08:26,377 --> 01:08:29,540
- Sometimes they're one and the same.
- I warn you...

786
01:08:29,747 --> 01:08:32,307
Your warnings
don't frighten me anymore.

787
01:08:32,516 --> 01:08:34,643
Then I demand an explanation.

788
01:08:34,852 --> 01:08:36,183
Very well.

789
01:08:38,889 --> 01:08:43,155
This tropical plant is known
as strychnos toxifera.

790
01:08:43,761 --> 01:08:46,628
The explorer Magellan
wrote of a substance...

791
01:08:46,830 --> 01:08:49,230
...used on darts by South Americans.

792
01:08:49,433 --> 01:08:53,301
It killed instantly, dropping
large animals in their tracks.

793
01:08:53,637 --> 01:08:58,336
- The poison was extracted from this.
- This is your so-called treatment?

794
01:08:59,376 --> 01:09:02,937
There are many poisons.
Some kill by corrosive action.

795
01:09:03,147 --> 01:09:04,546
But this...

796
01:09:05,182 --> 01:09:08,515
...this kills by
total relaxation of the muscles.

797
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:11,483
Particularly the lungs and heart.

798
01:09:11,822 --> 01:09:15,053
And when they stop, life stops.

799
01:09:15,793 --> 01:09:19,991
However, I have asked myself
if a dilution of this poison...

800
01:09:20,197 --> 01:09:24,634
...might not slacken the tensed
muscles of paralyzed patients.

801
01:09:24,835 --> 01:09:27,770
It was only a theory.
A flimsy one at that.

802
01:09:27,971 --> 01:09:31,634
- Too dangerous to be used on humans.
- I see.

803
01:09:31,842 --> 01:09:35,608
I'm afraid a long period of research
lies ahead of me.

804
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:40,211
- I wouldn't want to fail.
- That is correct.

805
01:09:40,417 --> 01:09:43,318
See to it that you do succeed!

806
01:10:01,004 --> 01:10:03,029
I love this music.

807
01:10:04,341 --> 01:10:05,865
It's exquisite...

808
01:10:06,076 --> 01:10:07,771
...but sad.

809
01:10:09,213 --> 01:10:12,080
But there's strength
under the sadness.

810
01:10:20,257 --> 01:10:22,418
That was very beautiful.

811
01:10:24,294 --> 01:10:27,855
You and your music are the only
beautiful things here.

812
01:10:34,071 --> 01:10:36,471
I never asked you why you...

813
01:10:36,673 --> 01:10:39,335
- Why I married him?
- Yes.

814
01:10:39,877 --> 01:10:42,141
It is not a very pretty story.

815
01:10:43,313 --> 01:10:45,975
My father made the
arrangements by letter...

816
01:10:46,183 --> 01:10:50,984
...without meeting the baron,
and we sailed to seal the agreement.

817
01:10:51,188 --> 01:10:53,918
- Surely after meeting this brute...?
- Yes.

818
01:10:54,124 --> 01:10:57,616
Even my father, who worshiped money,
changed his mind.

819
01:10:58,028 --> 01:11:00,690
But my father had gambled
and was in debt.

820
01:11:00,898 --> 01:11:03,833
He'd even misused funds
entrusted to him.

821
01:11:04,034 --> 01:11:07,333
The baron offered him both a reward
and a threat.

822
01:11:07,538 --> 01:11:10,166
The baron is fond of threats.

823
01:11:10,374 --> 01:11:12,604
He offered to pay all debts...

824
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:15,472
...and threatened to expose him
as an embezzler.

825
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:19,274
So your father forced you into this
unsavory alliance?

826
01:11:19,483 --> 01:11:21,917
No. The choice was mine.

827
01:11:22,119 --> 01:11:23,848
I did it to save him.

828
01:11:24,054 --> 01:11:25,681
Oh, my dear.

829
01:11:27,691 --> 01:11:29,955
What a charming tableau.

830
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:32,287
- Sir Robert?
- Yes?

831
01:11:32,496 --> 01:11:35,954
Krull informs me a dog
survived your injection.

832
01:11:36,166 --> 01:11:37,793
He's a reliable informant.

833
01:11:38,001 --> 01:11:42,404
- Then the extract has been made safe.
- Yes, but I need a few more days.

834
01:11:42,606 --> 01:11:46,599
- Why? If the dog lived...
- Men are not dogs. I must be certain.

835
01:11:46,810 --> 01:11:51,372
I'm certain enough. I insist you
perform the treatment tonight.

836
01:11:51,582 --> 01:11:53,709
The risk is too great. I refuse.

837
01:11:53,917 --> 01:11:55,009
Madam...

838
01:11:55,219 --> 01:11:56,652
...take this.

839
01:11:57,254 --> 01:12:00,485
- But why?
- The room upstairs. Open it.

840
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:03,455
You allow no one but yourself
to open it.

841
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:05,821
Tonight I make an exception.

842
01:12:06,463 --> 01:12:09,489
Will you go? We will follow.

843
01:12:37,361 --> 01:12:38,851
Open it.

844
01:12:47,804 --> 01:12:50,204
Go in. Do not be afraid.

845
01:13:01,351 --> 01:13:02,716
Robert!

846
01:13:03,053 --> 01:13:04,543
Robert!

847
01:13:11,962 --> 01:13:13,896
Someone's in here.

848
01:13:14,598 --> 01:13:16,156
I sense it.

849
01:13:20,103 --> 01:13:22,936
Someone's in here. I know it!

850
01:13:26,710 --> 01:13:28,837
Why do you just stand there?

851
01:13:30,113 --> 01:13:31,876
Who are you?

852
01:13:41,625 --> 01:13:43,752
What's happening? Who's in there?

853
01:13:47,130 --> 01:13:51,692
Poor girl. Perhaps it was a shock
seeing him for the first time.

854
01:13:52,636 --> 01:13:56,094
My reminder of earthly greed
and mortality.

855
01:13:56,406 --> 01:13:59,569
My nemesis. My demon.

856
01:13:59,776 --> 01:14:02,301
My father, whose grave I defiled.

857
01:14:02,512 --> 01:14:05,504
Damn you. Damn you to eternal hell.

858
01:14:05,716 --> 01:14:07,946
You have no decency, no feeling!

859
01:14:08,251 --> 01:14:11,812
As usual, you speak
with unwavering accuracy.

860
01:14:12,022 --> 01:14:16,118
Life has erased all decency
and human feeling from my heart.

861
01:14:16,326 --> 01:14:20,820
It is for you to restore it.
Tonight in your laboratory.

862
01:14:21,198 --> 01:14:22,722
And if I refuse?

863
01:14:22,933 --> 01:14:25,493
Then Maude stays here...

864
01:14:25,702 --> 01:14:28,068
...all night with him.

865
01:14:30,407 --> 01:14:32,568
Very well, tonight.

866
01:14:51,628 --> 01:14:54,119
What is that strange instrument?

867
01:14:55,165 --> 01:14:56,689
A new invention...

868
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:59,198
...called a hypodermic needle.

869
01:14:59,603 --> 01:15:03,198
South Americans use this
extract to poison their darts.

870
01:15:03,573 --> 01:15:07,270
You might say this instrument
is my dart.

871
01:15:07,944 --> 01:15:12,005
I warn you, this has never been
used on a human. It may kill you.

872
01:15:12,382 --> 01:15:15,783
I urge you one last time
not to insist upon its use.

873
01:15:15,986 --> 01:15:19,649
You seek to frighten me,
to plant distrust in my heart.

874
01:15:19,856 --> 01:15:22,290
No. But theoretically speaking...

875
01:15:22,492 --> 01:15:27,259
...what prevents me from injecting
undiluted poison, killing you?

876
01:15:27,464 --> 01:15:29,125
Three things.

877
01:15:29,332 --> 01:15:32,597
First, your silly code of ethics
as a knight.

878
01:15:32,803 --> 01:15:36,204
Second, the oath of your profession.

879
01:15:36,406 --> 01:15:38,340
And thirdly...

880
01:15:38,542 --> 01:15:41,375
...the knowledge that if I die...

881
01:15:41,578 --> 01:15:44,206
...Krull has orders to put
you and my wife...

882
01:15:44,414 --> 01:15:49,078
...to the slowest and most hideous
of deaths in the torture chamber.

883
01:15:51,788 --> 01:15:54,723
Then I accept your terms.

884
01:15:56,059 --> 01:15:58,721
- Will you come with me?
- Where are we going?

885
01:15:58,929 --> 01:16:01,159
Into your past.

886
01:16:01,364 --> 01:16:03,093
Into your youth.

887
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,077
Maude, you needn't come in.

888
01:16:26,490 --> 01:16:28,822
May we have some lights, Krull?

889
01:16:32,629 --> 01:16:36,292
- Will you sit in this chair?
- I do not understand this.

890
01:16:37,167 --> 01:16:39,692
I'll explain while Krull
ties you down.

891
01:16:39,903 --> 01:16:41,461
- What?
- For your own good.

892
01:16:41,671 --> 01:16:44,834
There may be a violent reaction.
Krull?

893
01:16:48,078 --> 01:16:50,911
There is healing of the flesh
and of the spirit.

894
01:16:51,114 --> 01:16:55,244
You said shock brought your face
to its condition. Remember?

895
01:16:55,452 --> 01:16:56,282
Yes.

896
01:16:56,486 --> 01:16:59,046
Then perhaps shock may be your cure.

897
01:16:59,256 --> 01:17:01,588
Shock and medical science.

898
01:17:01,792 --> 01:17:03,657
You speak in riddles.

899
01:17:05,362 --> 01:17:07,330
Medical science.

900
01:17:09,699 --> 01:17:10,688
Shock.

901
01:17:10,901 --> 01:17:13,301
Do you think that can shock me now?

902
01:17:13,503 --> 01:17:16,336
I have lived with it for many years.

903
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:18,167
We shall see.

904
01:17:55,312 --> 01:17:59,214
Now we'll leave you alone,
as you were alone in that grave.

905
01:17:59,749 --> 01:18:02,912
- How long?
- As long as is necessary.

906
01:18:03,753 --> 01:18:04,913
Krull.

907
01:18:21,805 --> 01:18:24,205
No. Not like this.

908
01:18:24,407 --> 01:18:27,706
Not like this! Not in the dark!

909
01:18:27,911 --> 01:18:29,970
Not in the dark!

910
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:31,408
Not like this!

911
01:18:31,615 --> 01:18:33,776
- Let him out!
- And mar my work?

912
01:18:33,984 --> 01:18:38,216
But he's suffering!
That needle, you're poisoning him!

913
01:18:45,896 --> 01:18:47,727
He's dead! He's dead!

914
01:18:48,498 --> 01:18:49,829
Master.

915
01:18:50,133 --> 01:18:52,124
Do not touch him, Krull.

916
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:04,440
No, baron. Do not speak.

917
01:19:04,648 --> 01:19:07,947
The muscles are so relaxed
you can't move your lips.

918
01:19:08,852 --> 01:19:11,787
If you attempt it,
you'll destroy our work.

919
01:19:12,756 --> 01:19:15,384
This condition will pass
in a few minutes.

920
01:19:20,330 --> 01:19:21,854
Untie him.

921
01:21:11,174 --> 01:21:15,804
"By this document and the power vested
in me as a lord of this land...

922
01:21:16,012 --> 01:21:19,277
...I irrevocably and forever
annul my marriage...

923
01:21:19,482 --> 01:21:23,441
...with one who was no wife and
for whom I have no need.

924
01:21:23,653 --> 01:21:25,553
Sardonicus."

925
01:21:37,367 --> 01:21:40,393
"You have fulfilled your part
of the bargain.

926
01:21:40,637 --> 01:21:43,834
Name your fee, for I owe you much."

927
01:21:46,943 --> 01:21:49,173
No, baron. You owe me nothing.

928
01:22:26,950 --> 01:22:29,680
The train leaves
in less than one hour.

929
01:22:29,886 --> 01:22:31,114
Thank you.

930
01:22:39,262 --> 01:22:40,627
Sir Robert!

931
01:22:41,998 --> 01:22:44,558
I thought we'd seen the last of you.

932
01:22:44,767 --> 01:22:48,760
- You must return.
- Impossible. We'd miss the train.

933
01:22:48,972 --> 01:22:51,702
But he cannot open his mouth!

934
01:22:51,908 --> 01:22:52,897
Nonsense!

935
01:22:53,109 --> 01:22:57,603
But it's true! He cannot speak,
he cannot eat or drink!

936
01:22:57,814 --> 01:23:02,376
I'm a strong man. With my own
hands I tried to pry his jaws apart.

937
01:23:02,585 --> 01:23:03,779
But I could not!

938
01:23:03,987 --> 01:23:06,854
- He'll starve and die!
- He won't.

939
01:23:07,290 --> 01:23:10,555
You must tell him he can
open his mouth himself.

940
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:14,389
- But you are his healer.
- I did not heal him.

941
01:23:14,597 --> 01:23:19,364
The fluid I injected into his face
was distilled water.

942
01:23:19,903 --> 01:23:22,701
Water? But the tropical plant...

943
01:23:22,906 --> 01:23:25,238
...the experiments, all the dogs!

944
01:23:25,441 --> 01:23:29,400
An elaborate show. The dogs
were not dead, only drugged.

945
01:23:29,612 --> 01:23:34,345
I had to make him think I was
preparing a new, powerful medication.

946
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:37,748
- I still do not understand.
- Go to him, Krull.

947
01:23:37,954 --> 01:23:40,616
Remind him of something he said to me.

948
01:23:40,823 --> 01:23:44,122
His affliction came not from God
above nor fiend below...

949
01:23:44,727 --> 01:23:48,356
...but from within his heart,
his brain, his soul.

950
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:51,500
His cure came from within him too.

951
01:23:52,402 --> 01:23:53,926
But he needs...

952
01:23:54,137 --> 01:23:57,573
All he needs is to know that
he was his own healer.

953
01:23:57,774 --> 01:24:00,140
Without that, he is doomed.

954
01:24:01,277 --> 01:24:02,744
Yes.

955
01:24:04,581 --> 01:24:06,811
I see!

956
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:09,184
Then go at once and tell him.

957
01:24:09,385 --> 01:24:11,512
Yes, I will.

958
01:24:22,999 --> 01:24:26,628
Is it true the medication
was nothing more than water?

959
01:24:26,836 --> 01:24:27,825
Nothing more.

960
01:24:28,538 --> 01:24:30,938
I knew after the best techniques...

961
01:24:31,140 --> 01:24:33,904
...of the world's best
physicians failed...

962
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:37,978
...I'd have to work on his mental
self, not his physical self.

963
01:24:38,314 --> 01:24:40,748
Then the plant wasn't poisonous?

964
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:42,713
Oh, yes. Very poisonous.

965
01:24:42,919 --> 01:24:44,853
Much too poisonous to use.

966
01:24:45,054 --> 01:24:48,854
Someday its powers may be
harnessed for good...

967
01:24:49,058 --> 01:24:50,685
...but that day is not yet.

968
01:24:50,893 --> 01:24:54,420
And so I did not use an extract
of the plant at all.

969
01:24:54,631 --> 01:24:55,620
Only water.

970
01:24:55,832 --> 01:24:57,766
Only water.

971
01:24:58,935 --> 01:25:00,630
And his own mind.

972
01:25:02,238 --> 01:25:04,172
That's how the story ends.

973
01:25:04,374 --> 01:25:07,832
With the lovers living
happily ever after.

974
01:25:08,311 --> 01:25:11,678
But has Mr. Sardonicus
been punished enough?

975
01:25:12,081 --> 01:25:15,915
Don't you agree with me that
such a miserable scoundrel...

976
01:25:16,119 --> 01:25:19,282
...should be made
to suffer and suffer...

977
01:25:19,489 --> 01:25:20,751
...and suffer?

978
01:25:20,957 --> 01:25:25,621
When you think of what he did
to his wife and to those girls...

979
01:25:25,828 --> 01:25:27,693
...and about those leeches?

980
01:25:27,897 --> 01:25:32,425
I think ordinary punishment
is too good for Mr. Sardonicus.

981
01:25:32,635 --> 01:25:37,163
If you feel that way too,
if you want to show him no mercy...

982
01:25:37,373 --> 01:25:39,807
...and punish him as he deserves...

983
01:25:40,009 --> 01:25:43,445
...then hold up your
Punishment Poll ballot...

984
01:25:43,646 --> 01:25:47,138
...with the thumb pointing down,
like this.

985
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:52,344
If, conversely, you're an "I wouldn't
hurt a fly" kind of person...

986
01:25:52,555 --> 01:25:55,683
...one of those sweet, nice,
kind souls...

987
01:25:55,892 --> 01:25:58,383
...who would let Mr. Sardonicus
go free...

988
01:25:58,594 --> 01:26:03,531
...you should hold your ballot with
the thumb pointing up, like this.

989
01:26:03,733 --> 01:26:05,564
Now we're ready for voting.

990
01:26:05,768 --> 01:26:08,931
No mercy, or mercy?

991
01:26:09,138 --> 01:26:11,834
Hold the ballots high, please.

992
01:26:12,442 --> 01:26:15,070
Oh, come now. Hold them up.

993
01:26:15,278 --> 01:26:16,506
Please?

994
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:18,613
That's better.

995
01:26:18,815 --> 01:26:22,216
The lady in the 9th row,
a little higher.

996
01:26:22,852 --> 01:26:27,687
Little boy in the back, sit down
so I can count the cards behind you.

997
01:26:28,524 --> 01:26:30,754
That young couple on the left...

998
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:34,054
...is that one vote or two
you're casting?

999
01:26:34,263 --> 01:26:37,391
Two votes? Thank you.

1000
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,898
Thank you all very much.

1001
01:26:41,337 --> 01:26:43,532
Mercy...

1002
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:45,332
...no mercy.

1003
01:26:47,076 --> 01:26:50,409
Seventeen...
Carry the three...

1004
01:26:51,948 --> 01:26:54,473
...subtract 40.

1005
01:26:55,318 --> 01:26:57,115
No mercy.

1006
01:26:57,320 --> 01:27:00,255
So be it. You have given the verdict.

1007
01:27:00,456 --> 01:27:04,187
You have made the decision
and the majority of you...

1008
01:27:04,394 --> 01:27:08,421
...have sentenced Mr. Sardonicus
to further punishment.

1009
01:27:08,698 --> 01:27:13,328
Mr. Projectionist, let the sentence
be carried out.

1010
01:27:57,079 --> 01:27:58,046
Master...

1011
01:27:58,247 --> 01:28:01,739
...I'm very sorry, but I missed them.

1012
01:28:01,951 --> 01:28:04,442
The train had already left.
