     in all those 26 years,

 Well, there was this party,    

106
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:40,518
 and I knew that she was        
 too weak to withstand          
 the strain of it.              

107
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,554

108
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,491
 She had to have this party.    

109
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:53,498
 She had to dress up            
 in her finest gown.            

110
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,836
         Dance and sing.        

111
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:06,578
     Less than an hour          
     after the party had begun, 
     she collapsed.             

112
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:16,153
     I picked her up in my arms 
     and I carried her up       
     to her bedroom.            

113
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,056
 I put her on her bed.

00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,860
 Her face was white.            

115

116
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,568
 She was enraged, furious.      

117
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:34,038
 Even dying, she was enraged.   

118

  "It was the baby,"

119

 she'd avenge herself.          

120

 "It was the baby."

00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:54,559

 before even the doctor         
 could arrive,                  

122
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,763
    she was dead.               

123

 I only wanted to kill myself.  

130
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:25,790

   a dozen times.

       not to do it now.

     if we search the premises?

        No. Where do you        
        want to start?          

574
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:24,106

      from its applications.

    Helene, Helene.             

666
01:04:35,238 --> 01:04:37,539
        The issue               
        must be acknowledged.   

667
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:44,746
     Within this skull,         
     as well you know, Doctor,  

668
01:04:44,781 --> 01:04:48,950
     there is tissue            
     which is dying,            
     even as I speak.           

669
01:04:50,053 --> 01:04:52,353
     I am physically doomed.    

670
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:55,523
       I do not say this out of 
       bitterness or despair.   

671
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:58,693
    However, there is one favor 
    I would ask.                

672
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:02,597

  and painful decline to death, 

673
01:05:02,632 --> 01:05:05,433
           through the auspices 
           of Mr. Carmichael.   

674
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:07,569
       Would you deny him this, 
       Doctor?                  

675
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:10,071
        No, sir.                

676
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:14,275
     And yet, you know,         
     he will accept nothing     
     for this blessing,         

677
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:18,046
       save some trifling favor 
       on my deathbed.

           have mentioned it,   
           it's so slight.      

680
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:27,121
    No, please, I want to know. 

681
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:28,990
                Well, my dear,  
                it's simply...  

682
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:34,095
         You tell them, sir.    
         You can explain it     
         so much better than I. 

683
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:38,232
 Mr. Valdemar has consented     
 to be mesmerized               
 <i> in articulo mortis,</i>           

684
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:39,634
     which is to say...         

685
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:41,769
 JAMES: At the point of death!  

686
01:05:41,804 --> 01:05:45,473
    I fear it sounds            
    more dreadful               
    than it really is.          

687
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:49,644
       What does it mean?       
       Ernest, why?             

688
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:53,982
 To ascertain, madam, just      
 how long the actual moment     
 of death can be forestalled.   

689
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:57,418
    A momentous experiment.     

690
01:05:57,453 --> 01:06:01,255
 Momentous.                     
 Monstrous would be             
 more the word.                 

691
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:04,792
          Sir, I appeal to you, 
          withdraw this offer.  

692
01:06:04,827 --> 01:06:07,929
       The deathbed is no place 
       for lunatic experiments. 

693
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:11,099
        My dear young friend,   
        what can it matter      
        whether I die           

694
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:15,269
     10 or 20 minutes           
     beyond that point          
     when I should die anyway?  

695
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:18,172
  What could be less important? 

696
01:06:18,207 --> 01:06:23,011
 I owe this gentleman           
 a great deal. A great deal.    

697
01:06:23,046 --> 01:06:27,983
 I could not dream              
 of refusing him                
 such an insignificant request. 

698
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:31,653
               As you say, sir. 

699
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:36,124
       I fear I must leave now. 
     Oh, so soon?               

700
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:41,696
   Oh, I'm sorry.               
   Goodnight, Doctor.           
   Thank you for attending.     

701
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:45,667
 My dear, show our friend       
 to the door, will you?         
            Yes, of course.     

702
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:56,711
               A bit more wine, 
               Mr. Carmichael?  

703
01:06:58,381 --> 01:06:59,981
 Oh, thank you.                 

704
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,816
     Elliot, this experiment... 

705
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:05,153
 Do everything in your power    
 to dissuade him                
 from it, Helene.               

706
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:08,556
 I've no proof                  
 that it's dangerous,           
 no proof whatever.             

707
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:10,558
 Only sense that it might be.   

708
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:15,329
            What is it, Elliot? 

709
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:21,002
  Why is it since               
  that man entered our life,    
  I can't think, I'm uncertain? 

710
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:25,006
       Oh, he helps Ernest.     
       I can't argue with that. 

711
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:27,375
        He seems to relieve him 
        of all pain.            

712
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:30,411
      To see him suffer         
      is more than I can stand, 
      but at the same time...   

713
01:07:30,446 --> 01:07:32,447
 You distrust Carmichael?       

714
01:07:33,583 --> 01:07:34,916
                   Yes, I do.   

715
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:39,587
           Still it's true,     
           he asks for nothing. 

716
01:07:39,622 --> 01:07:44,258
 Perhaps he asks for nothing    
 because he desires everything, 
 including you.                 

717
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:46,194
          You can't be serious. 

718
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:47,895
 You haven't seen him           
 looking at you, then?          

719
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:52,033
             Yes, but surely... 
 Of course, I have              
 no right to say this, really,  

720
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:54,069
 for I, too, look at you.       

721
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,606
                Elliot, please. 

722
01:07:58,641 --> 01:08:02,777
           You know how I feel. 
           I love my husband,   
           I respect him.       

723
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:06,080
 No more than I do.             
                   I know that. 

724
01:08:06,115 --> 01:08:10,285
       So let us think of       
       nothing else but Ernest  
       and our respect for him. 

725
01:08:14,991 --> 01:08:17,759
 Goodnight, Helene.             
                     Goodnight. 

726
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:29,570
            Ernest.             

727
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:31,473
 Hmm? Oh, yes, my dear.         

728
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:34,275
          Won't you reconsider? 

729
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:37,078
 Regarding the experiment?      

730
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:40,414
             I fear him.        
 You fear Carmichael?           

731
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:44,452
      But, my dear,             
      think of the pain         
      he spared me.             

732
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:46,754
          If only you could see 
          the change in him     

733
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:49,657
           when you're under    
           his control, Ernest. 

734
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,793
        All the fawning ceases. 

735
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:57,265
         He no longer calls you 
         Mr. Valdemar,          
         it's just Valdemar.    

736
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,133
       He tells you what to do, 
       what to think.           

737
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:01,803
 Please, my dear, no more.      

738
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,173
              Let us forget it. 

739
01:09:05,208 --> 01:09:09,110
          It is established     
          and of no importance. 

740
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:11,279
      What is important is you. 

741
01:09:11,314 --> 01:09:15,283
       I wish with all my heart 
       that following my death  

742
01:09:15,318 --> 01:09:18,119
            you would marry     
            our good Dr. James. 

743
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:20,655
        How...                  
   No, no, no, please, my dear. 

744
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:22,857
                 Let me finish. 

745
01:09:22,892 --> 01:09:25,960
         I know that there      
         is a bond between you. 

746
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:30,131
    All honorable.              
    I know that, too,           
    and I love you both for it. 

747
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:34,468
           But I am going       
           to die soon, Helene. 

748
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:40,541
   And it would make me         
   very happy to know           
   that you would not be alone. 

749
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:43,811
    That you would marry again. 

750
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:51,485
    Oh, my dear. Your happiness 
    means more to me            
    than anything, anything.    

751
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:57,592
           But I refuse to die  
           until that happiness 
           has been assured.    

752
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:19,180
                (WEAKLY)        
                It approaches,  
                does it not?    

753
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,382
           No pretense, please. 

754
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:24,552
         It approaches.         

755
01:10:27,290 --> 01:10:32,227
      No, my dear, no sorrow.   
      I am content, believe me. 

756
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:40,368
  Did you inform Mr. Carmichael 
  as I requested?               

757
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:45,473
 He is below, sir.              
                Then fetch him, 
                if you will.    

758
01:10:46,642 --> 01:10:50,245
              Quickly. Quickly. 

759
01:11:19,141 --> 01:11:20,775
 Have a care, sir.              

760
01:11:36,359 --> 01:11:42,263
         So, the time has come, 
         Mr. Carmichael.        

761
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:44,799
        It will be to you, sir, 
        I promise.              

762
01:11:44,834 --> 01:11:47,835
      No more than sinking into 
      a dreamless sleep.        

763
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:50,505
                Best to hurry,  
                Mr. Carmichael. 

764
01:11:52,808 --> 01:11:58,846
                Oh, no despair, 
                I implore you.  

765
01:11:58,881 --> 01:12:04,652
           It is peace I go to. 
           Freedom from         
           this ghastly pain.   

766
01:12:05,388 --> 01:12:07,322
             Your hand, Doctor. 

767
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:13,227
              I charge you this 
              upon your soul,   

768
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:17,332
          watch over my Helene. 

769
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:22,904
                   Swear to it. 
         I swear to it.         
         Rest easily, sir.      

770
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:25,340
             I do now.          

771
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:32,046
         With all my heart,     
         I thank you            

772
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:38,018
     for having added           
     to my life one great,      
     sweet measure of devotion. 

773
01:12:38,053 --> 01:12:40,154
    (SOBBING)                   

774
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:42,523
               You may proceed, 
               Mr. Carmichael.  

775
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:57,671
     Look at the turning wheel. 

776
01:12:57,706 --> 01:13:01,709
 At the changing of the colors. 
 And sleep.                     

777
01:13:02,745 --> 01:13:06,381
       Deep, deep sleep.        

778
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:10,885
        Your body losing        
        all sensation.          

779
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:16,224
      Your mind enveloped       
      in darkness.              

780
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:20,928
   Nothing can disturb you now, 

781
01:13:20,963 --> 01:13:24,432
       as you drift ever deeper 
       into darkness            

782
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:31,906
 and sleep, sleep, sleep.       

783
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:39,614
        Valdemar.               
        Do you hear me?         
        It is my voice.         

784
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:43,284
            I hear.             

785
01:13:45,821 --> 01:13:47,922
                Are you asleep? 

786

     <i> to marry Mr. Carmichael.</i>  

896
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:54,241
    No.                         
          You heard him, madam. 

897
01:21:54,276 --> 01:21:56,443
  But he's under your control.  
  The words were                
  given to him by you.          

898
01:21:56,478 --> 01:21:57,744
                 That is a lie. 
              Is it?            

899
01:21:57,779 --> 01:21:59,713
                        Yes!    

900
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:02,883
 Elliot, please,                
 you must leave now.            

901
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:05,252
                  What?         
 I want you to go.              

902
01:22:05,287 --> 01:22:07,754
      But don't you understand? 
      That was not              
      your husband speaking.    

903
01:22:07,789 --> 01:22:09,456
 It was his voice.              
        But not his will!       

904
01:22:09,491 --> 01:22:11,725
 I don't know that.             
    Helene, in the name of God. 

905
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:16,163
 Elliot, please go.             
 There's nothing more           
 to be said or done.            

906
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:20,267
 I just want you to go now.     

907
01:22:20,302 --> 01:22:25,606
 Very well, but I shall         
 be back, and God help you      
 if you do her harm in any way. 

908
01:22:50,132 --> 01:22:52,265
      Well, madam?              

909
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,835
            I believe Dr. James 
            is quite correct.   

910
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:57,671
   It is not my husband         
   who would have me marry you. 

911
01:22:57,706 --> 01:23:00,674
 You heard him                  
 with your own ears.            
                It was not him. 

912
01:23:03,011 --> 01:23:07,981
 However, I will make a bargain 
 with you, Mr. Carmichael.      

913
01:23:08,016 --> 01:23:12,319
 I'll marry you                 
 upon the stipulation           
 that you set my husband free.  

914
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:16,857
        I need make no bargains 
        with you, madam.        

915
01:23:16,892 --> 01:23:19,459
       What?                    
           You will marry me    
           in any case.         

916
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:22,796
 No, no, Mr. Carmichael,        
 not unless you end             
 his torment.                   

917
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:26,366
             Edicts, Madam?     
             Orders from you?   

918
01:23:26,401 --> 01:23:30,137
     Allow me to enlighten you. 
     I am in command here.      
     You will do as I say.      

919
01:23:30,172 --> 01:23:33,140
   Or I will leave Mr. Valdemar 
   exactly as he is, and never, 

920
01:23:33,175 --> 01:23:36,176
  do you understand me, madam,  
  never let him go.             

921
01:23:36,211 --> 01:23:38,812
             I've coveted you   
             these many months, 
             waited for you,    

922
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:40,647
              hungered for you, 
              and now you shall 
              be my wife.       

923
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:42,816
               I shall not ask. 
               I shall take     
               what I desire.   

924
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:44,818

       if I demand it.          

925
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:47,054
 I've heard enough! No!         

926
01:23:47,089 --> 01:23:51,025
 Stop it! Let me go!            
 Let me go, you're hurting me!  

927
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:54,028
 Help! Help me!                 

928
01:23:55,197 --> 01:23:59,199
                 Let me go!     
                 Help! Help me!
