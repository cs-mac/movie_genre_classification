1
00:01:05,283 --> 00:01:06,375
Come on, sweetie pie.

2
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:12,013
Morning, Elvis.
You're a pretty Elvis, aren't you?

3
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,053
Yes, you are.

4
00:01:17,128 --> 00:01:20,586
Jesus Christ, Ronnie, you know
I have to fucking work tonight.

5
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:22,823
Somebody around here
has got to make some money.

6
00:01:22,934 --> 00:01:25,528
I'm all broken up here, bitch.
I can't work.

7
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,970
- Yeah, and whose fault is that?
- Fuck you.

8
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:30,303
Oh, my God, you're pathetic.

9
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:32,570
You know that new waitress
over at the Bingo Lounge?

10
00:01:32,644 --> 00:01:34,874
She's been giving me the freaky eye.

11
00:01:34,946 --> 00:01:37,346
Oh, the whore with the big tits
hanging down to her knees?

12
00:01:37,415 --> 00:01:38,609
Maybe I'll choke the chicken,

13
00:01:38,683 --> 00:01:41,174
purge my snorkel
all over them flappy-ass tits.

14
00:01:41,252 --> 00:01:42,514
Good. Well, have
a good fucking time.

15
00:01:42,587 --> 00:01:43,849
- I will.
- I hope she likes cripples.

16
00:01:43,922 --> 00:01:48,052
Bitch, I will crawl over there,
and I will skull fuck the shit outta you!

17
00:01:48,126 --> 00:01:50,219
Oh, I'll get the crutches for you.

18
00:01:52,797 --> 00:01:54,765
See what you did?
Fucking loudmouth.

19
00:01:54,832 --> 00:01:55,821
Waah! Waah!

20
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,595
That's all that fucker does is cry.

21
00:01:57,669 --> 00:01:59,569
Waah! Waah!

22
00:02:00,405 --> 00:02:02,100
Cry and shit. Cry and shit.

23
00:02:02,173 --> 00:02:04,073
Just like you.
That's all you do is cry and shit.

24
00:02:04,142 --> 00:02:06,372
Fuck you and set it
on my pole right now, bitch.

25
00:02:06,444 --> 00:02:08,071
Fuck off.

26
00:02:13,818 --> 00:02:15,911
Mom?

27
00:02:19,023 --> 00:02:21,048
Can't you see I'm making eggs over here?

28
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:22,592
I'll pass.

29
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,718
Since when?

30
00:02:23,795 --> 00:02:27,128
Since now. They're chicken abortions,
and they're fucking gross.

31
00:02:27,198 --> 00:02:29,029
They are not chicken abortions.

32
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,795
Like you know what an abortion is.

33
00:02:32,737 --> 00:02:34,432
You know what, can you please
go upstairs and get your brother?

34
00:02:34,772 --> 00:02:36,433
Why do I always have to do it?

35
00:02:36,507 --> 00:02:37,701
Just do it!

36
00:02:39,711 --> 00:02:43,203
Don't you give me that look!

37
00:02:43,281 --> 00:02:46,216
Man, that bitch got herself
a nice little dumper.

38
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:50,114
- What did you just say?
- You heard me.

39
00:02:50,188 --> 00:02:53,351
No, say it again, Ronnie!
Say it to my face!

40
00:02:53,424 --> 00:02:56,951
Oh, what's the matter?
You jealous of your own daughter's ass?

41
00:02:57,028 --> 00:02:59,189
- Fucking pig.
- Aah!

42
00:02:59,264 --> 00:03:00,856
You fucking whore!

43
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:04,591
All right, now clean it up!

44
00:03:04,669 --> 00:03:06,193
- Go on.
- I'm not gonna do this anymore!

45
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:09,534
Michael.

46
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:11,837
Stop jerking off in there.

47
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:13,206
Get away!

48
00:03:13,278 --> 00:03:15,371
Hey! Get your ass downstairs

49
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:17,311
and wash your hands, you little shit.

50
00:03:17,382 --> 00:03:20,909
I'm not listening!
Aaaahhh!

51
00:03:20,985 --> 00:03:22,213
Let me tell you something.

52
00:03:22,287 --> 00:03:24,448
That freak of yours,
he needs some serious discipline.

53
00:03:24,522 --> 00:03:26,513
I mean, he runs around like a little bitch.

54
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:28,491
You leave him alone.
Keep your hands off him.

55
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:31,790
Give me a fucking break.
He's probably a queer.

56
00:03:31,863 --> 00:03:34,161
He's gonna grow up,
end up cutting his dick and balls off

57
00:03:34,232 --> 00:03:36,063
and changing his name to Michelle.

58
00:03:37,302 --> 00:03:39,998
<i>There he is.
Good morning, Michelle, ma belle.</i>

59
00:03:40,071 --> 00:03:42,039
What the hell took you two so long?

60
00:03:42,106 --> 00:03:45,007
Elvis died. I had to flush him.

61
00:03:45,076 --> 00:03:47,544
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

62
00:03:47,612 --> 00:03:49,773
We'll get you a new one
after school, okay?

63
00:03:49,847 --> 00:03:51,109
Okay.

64
00:03:51,182 --> 00:03:54,117
What'd you do to him,
stroke him to death?

65
00:03:54,185 --> 00:03:55,675
Uh, Elvis.

66
00:03:55,753 --> 00:03:58,449
Elvis! Uh! Uh! Uh!

67
00:03:58,523 --> 00:04:00,388
You know what?
It's a fucking rat.

68
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,255
Who pays money for a fucking rat?

69
00:04:02,327 --> 00:04:04,124
I mean, it's a goddamn rat, man.

70
00:04:04,195 --> 00:04:05,526
Morning, Boo.

71
00:04:05,596 --> 00:04:08,064
"Morning, Boo. "

72
00:04:11,803 --> 00:04:13,100
Take that damn thing off.

73
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:18,975
You are starting to annoy me, boy.

74
00:04:19,043 --> 00:04:20,067
I hate you.

75
00:04:20,144 --> 00:04:22,135
And I hate you, too. You see this?

76
00:04:22,213 --> 00:04:25,080
As soon as this heals,
I'm gonna break it again on your fucking face!

77
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:27,617
Enough, all right?
Can we just eat in peace for once?

78
00:04:38,062 --> 00:04:41,361
What a fucking pussy, dude.
I told you he wouldn't fight.

79
00:04:41,432 --> 00:04:43,423
He's all fucking talk.
I was like... We were fighting, right?

80
00:04:43,501 --> 00:04:46,163
You were there. He was like,
"I'm not gonna fight you. " I was like...

81
00:04:46,237 --> 00:04:47,431
Yes!

82
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,271
I know where he lives.

83
00:04:50,341 --> 00:04:52,571
- You want to egg his house?
- We can totally do that.

84
00:04:52,643 --> 00:04:53,769
- Yeah.
- Oh.

85
00:04:53,845 --> 00:04:55,745
Hey, shit-pants.

86
00:04:55,813 --> 00:04:58,304
What's going on? You know, um...

87
00:04:58,383 --> 00:05:01,944
I heard your sister got caught
selling blow jobs in the bathroom.

88
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:07,013
I heard they had to pump the cum
out of her stomach.

89
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:10,656
Hey, Mikey, how's your mom doing?

90
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:13,891
You know, my old man said that for a buck
she'd rub her tits on his face.

91
00:05:13,965 --> 00:05:15,557
Shut up.

92
00:05:15,633 --> 00:05:16,964
What the fuck did you say, faggot?

93
00:05:17,034 --> 00:05:19,798
- Mikey's upset.
- Look how tough he is.

94
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:23,637
Hey, ball-licker, check this out.

95
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:27,701
I was thinking of making copies of Mommy
for the whole school.

96
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:30,407
- Fuck you.
- Hey! Tough guy!

97
00:05:30,481 --> 00:05:34,941
Think she'd suck my dick for a quarter
and let me suck her tits?

98
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:38,785
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Don't fucking yell in my face, you bitch!

99
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:43,187
Fuck off!

100
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:45,286
What the hell is going on here?

101
00:05:45,363 --> 00:05:46,352
Break it up!

102
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:47,830
I said break it up!

103
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:50,424
You over there,
you over there, you there.

104
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:52,833
- He started it.
- Shut up!

105
00:05:52,904 --> 00:05:53,962
Fuck you.

106
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:57,599
What did you say, son?

107
00:05:57,675 --> 00:06:00,337
I said fuck you.

108
00:06:00,845 --> 00:06:02,540
Fuck me?

109
00:06:03,448 --> 00:06:05,939
Come here.
Come here.

110
00:06:06,017 --> 00:06:07,382
- My bag!
- Grab it!

111
00:06:08,386 --> 00:06:12,618
Again? Again? Jesus, what is it with you
and this goddamn school?

112
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,385
I cannot keep coming down here like this.

113
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:16,484
Look, Miss Myers,

114
00:06:16,561 --> 00:06:20,827
I do not enjoy calling you down here
every five minutes.

115
00:06:20,898 --> 00:06:23,196
Really?
It sure seems like you fucking do.

116
00:06:23,267 --> 00:06:25,360
Can't you get control
over your school, principal?

117
00:06:25,436 --> 00:06:28,701
Yes, I can get control.
I can control my school.

118
00:06:28,773 --> 00:06:31,571
There's something you gotta know.

119
00:06:36,781 --> 00:06:40,308
Will you just relax a moment?
Please sit down and let me talk to you.

120
00:06:40,384 --> 00:06:42,579
- Please. Please.
- Okay. What?

121
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:44,712
Please, sit down.

122
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:47,622
- Thank God.
- Hi, Jim. How are you?

123
00:06:47,692 --> 00:06:48,716
Is this her?

124
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:53,558
Miss Myers, this is Dr. Loomis.
I took the liberty of calling him in.

125
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:56,092
- Happens to be a child psychologist...
- Thank you, Jim.

126
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:57,464
Psychologist?

127
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,866
May I ask you,

128
00:06:58,936 --> 00:07:02,269
has your son ever had any kind
of serious psychiatric evaluation?

129
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,808
Okay, I've had enough.
This is crazy.

130
00:07:04,876 --> 00:07:06,537
- Miss Myers, please.
- I gotta get back to work.

131
00:07:06,611 --> 00:07:08,078
- I gotta go.
- Please, ma'am.

132
00:07:08,145 --> 00:07:10,909
We only want the best for the child.
Please don't take offense.

133
00:07:10,982 --> 00:07:12,574
Please, sit down. Sit down.

134
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,674
Thank you.

135
00:07:13,751 --> 00:07:16,413
Look, uh, Miss Myers...

136
00:07:16,487 --> 00:07:18,148
we found this...

137
00:07:18,222 --> 00:07:20,019
in Michael's school bag.

138
00:07:21,993 --> 00:07:24,427
Come on. Big deal.
He found a dead cat.

139
00:07:26,497 --> 00:07:27,828
And these.

140
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:30,390
What is that?

141
00:07:30,468 --> 00:07:32,629
I hope you're not squeamish, Mrs. Myers.

142
00:07:33,738 --> 00:07:36,002
Oh, God.

143
00:07:36,073 --> 00:07:38,041
Oh, this is really sick.

144
00:07:39,911 --> 00:07:41,970
Are you saying Michael did this?

145
00:07:43,514 --> 00:07:45,072
Michael loves animals. He...

146
00:07:47,852 --> 00:07:49,285
Why would he do this?

147
00:07:49,353 --> 00:07:54,848
Mrs. Myers, typically the thrill of hurting
or causing pain to smaller creatures,

148
00:07:54,926 --> 00:07:57,360
it's often an early warning sign.

149
00:07:57,428 --> 00:07:58,986
Early warning sign for what?

150
00:08:01,632 --> 00:08:03,827
For much deeper and bigger problems.

151
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:06,233
What do you mean problems?
What is this?

152
00:08:06,304 --> 00:08:08,966
He's a very disturbed young man.

153
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,874
I have to evaluate him,
and I'd like to interview him.

154
00:08:12,944 --> 00:08:15,845
I need to take him
through a series of tests.

155
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:17,540
Well, you can talk to him,
but what does...

156
00:08:17,615 --> 00:08:19,344
what does evaluating him...
what does that mean?

157
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:23,513
Obviously, he's a very deranged
young mind that can do this to his pets.

158
00:08:23,588 --> 00:08:25,556
You don't know that he did that.

159
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:31,258
Fuck, man, if I get one more fucking detention,
I'll be fucking expelled.

160
00:08:31,329 --> 00:08:32,728
My old man's gonna beat my ass.

161
00:08:32,797 --> 00:08:35,789
We gotta get that piece of shit
on the weekend so we don't get in trouble.

162
00:08:35,866 --> 00:08:37,891
Dude, if I see that Myers pussy,
he's fucking dead.

163
00:08:53,851 --> 00:08:54,840
You want it?

164
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:56,443
Huh? Do you want it?

165
00:09:36,193 --> 00:09:37,558
Aah!

166
00:09:37,628 --> 00:09:39,152
Ow!

167
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:43,598
What the fuck?

168
00:09:43,668 --> 00:09:46,432
Oh, you're so fucking dead.

169
00:09:51,742 --> 00:09:53,903
Oh, please stop.

170
00:09:53,978 --> 00:09:55,036
Stop!

171
00:10:11,796 --> 00:10:12,820
Please.

172
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,004
Please.
Please no!

173
00:10:26,077 --> 00:10:27,635
I'm sorry.

174
00:10:30,114 --> 00:10:33,083
Don't hurt me. Just... I'm sorry.

175
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:39,014
No, no, no, don't.
Don't. Please. Please.

176
00:10:48,265 --> 00:10:50,358
Please.

177
00:10:50,434 --> 00:10:52,163
Don't hurt me.

178
00:11:02,713 --> 00:11:03,839
No.

179
00:11:59,003 --> 00:12:00,300
Hey, clown.

180
00:12:01,472 --> 00:12:02,769
Hey.

181
00:12:04,742 --> 00:12:07,006
Psycho boy.

182
00:12:07,077 --> 00:12:08,669
Cat killer.

183
00:12:09,847 --> 00:12:13,613
Do you really torture and kill
all them worthless animals, boy?

184
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,151
Make you feel like a real bad-ass
motherfucker killer, huh?

185
00:12:21,225 --> 00:12:23,159
That is some deep-ass,

186
00:12:23,227 --> 00:12:26,685
serious, faggoty-ass shit, man.

187
00:12:26,764 --> 00:12:28,732
Judith, I'm gonna be late!

188
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,462
"Judith, I'm gonna be late!"

189
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:35,232
You really are a whiny little bitch,
you know that?

190
00:12:35,306 --> 00:12:36,933
Ronnie, knock it off.

191
00:12:41,245 --> 00:12:43,543
Ma, Judith is wasting all my time.

192
00:12:43,614 --> 00:12:46,515
I really shouldn't even let you go
after that shit you pulled today at school.

193
00:12:46,584 --> 00:12:48,211
Oh, Ma, please?

194
00:12:48,285 --> 00:12:50,253
All right, Michael, calm down.

195
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:51,720
Tomorrow things are gonna change
around here,

196
00:12:51,789 --> 00:12:53,416
so I suggest you live it up tonight.

197
00:12:54,725 --> 00:12:56,750
Judith!

198
00:12:57,995 --> 00:12:59,053
Here.

199
00:13:02,566 --> 00:13:03,590
What?

200
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:05,794
Would you do me a favor and please
take your brother trick-or-treating?

201
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:09,135
Why don't you have that subhuman sloth
over there on the couch do it?

202
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:12,198
You know, if I could get that lazy drunk
off his fat ass, I would.

203
00:13:12,276 --> 00:13:16,906
Bitch, if you don't think I ain't making
a mental list of all your fucking bullshit!

204
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:20,516
Sweetie, look at me.

205
00:13:20,584 --> 00:13:22,347
I know things have been bad,

206
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:25,047
but tomorrow we start to make
everything better, okay?

207
00:13:26,724 --> 00:13:28,624
Yeah.

208
00:13:28,692 --> 00:13:31,991
I like your hair curly.
It looks pretty.

209
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:35,395
Thanks, sweetie.
Have fun trick-or-treating, okay?

210
00:13:35,466 --> 00:13:36,899
Don't eat too much candy.

211
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:38,127
Hey, Mrs. Myers.

212
00:13:38,202 --> 00:13:39,760
I want you out by 11.

213
00:13:39,837 --> 00:13:42,032
- What'd I do?
- I know what you do.

214
00:13:42,106 --> 00:13:43,437
Whatever.

215
00:13:45,142 --> 00:13:47,201
What about trick-or-treating?

216
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:49,212
Are you kidding me?
Go by yourself.

217
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,544
Aren't you too old for that, anyway?

218
00:13:51,615 --> 00:13:52,604
Whatever.

219
00:13:52,683 --> 00:13:54,548
Sorry, squirt, but have fun.

220
00:13:54,618 --> 00:13:56,609
Trick or treat!

221
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:17,073

00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:16,056
Hold up, man.

237
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,795
That fucking drunk-prick fuck Ronnie
ain't my dad.

238
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,929
Okay, I... I didn't know.

239
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:24,167
My daddy's in heaven, okay?

240
00:15:24,241 --> 00:15:26,141
Okay.

241
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:28,644
I'm sorry.

242
00:15:28,712 --> 00:15:30,179
Close your eyes.

243
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:36,543
Keep them closed, all right?

244
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:39,755
I got a surprise for you.

245
00:15:43,894 --> 00:15:44,918
Open.

246
00:15:44,995 --> 00:15:47,020
Aaarrrgghhh!

247
00:15:47,097 --> 00:15:49,998
Aaahh!

248
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:51,625
- Wow.
- What?

249
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:52,999
Take that stupid thing off.

250
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,834
Oh, come on, babe.
I want to do it with the mask on.

251
00:20:26,777 --> 00:20:28,074
Uhh!

252
00:20:38,021 --> 00:20:41,457
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!

253
00:22:11,715 --> 00:22:13,842
Steve, stop it.

254
00:22:15,886 --> 00:22:16,944
Stop.

255
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,180
Once a night is enough.

256
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:20,189
Stop it.

257
00:22:21,725 --> 00:22:23,192
Michael?

258
00:22:24,127 --> 00:22:26,755
Michael, what the fuck
are you doing in here?

259
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,855
Answer me.
Michael.

260
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:30,661
Michael!

261
00:22:30,734 --> 00:22:31,723
Answer me!

262
00:22:31,802 --> 00:22:34,737
What the fuck...
Michael!

263
00:22:34,805 --> 00:22:36,102
Answer...

264
00:24:25,115 --> 00:24:26,742
Happy Halloween, Boo.

265
00:24:49,639 --> 00:24:51,334
Jesus, what the hell happened now?

266
00:24:54,644 --> 00:24:56,976
Sweetie, what are you doing out here?

267
00:24:58,381 --> 00:24:59,746
It's freezing.

268
00:24:59,816 --> 00:25:01,443
Michael, what's going on?

269
00:25:02,953 --> 00:25:05,012
Michael, answer me.

270
00:25:07,223 --> 00:25:08,690
Give me the baby.

271
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:11,890
Michael, what is going on?

272
00:25:11,962 --> 00:25:13,327
Answer me.

273
00:25:26,743 --> 00:25:30,543
...in connection
with tonight's brutal murders.

274
00:25:35,085 --> 00:25:36,609
...the Myers family,

275
00:25:36,686 --> 00:25:39,746
and was described by police
as Manson-like in its viciousness,

276
00:25:39,823 --> 00:25:43,623
and more horrific than anything
Hollywood could imagine.

277
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:48,826
Judith Myers' nude body
was found lying face-down

278
00:25:48,898 --> 00:25:51,332
in a pool of blood in an upstairs hallway.

279
00:25:51,401 --> 00:25:54,427
Apparently she had been stabbed 17 times.

280
00:25:54,504 --> 00:25:59,373
Her boyfriend Steven Haley's body
was found in the kitchen downstairs,

281
00:25:59,442 --> 00:26:03,936
the victim of an apparent vicious beating
with an aluminum baseball bat.

282
00:26:04,014 --> 00:26:05,208
Along with Myers and Haley,

283
00:26:05,281 --> 00:26:07,249
a third victim, Ronnie White,

284
00:26:07,317 --> 00:26:09,114
who was found bound to a chair,

285
00:26:09,185 --> 00:26:12,211
White's neck slit wide open
with a kitchen knife

286
00:26:12,288 --> 00:26:15,451
and stabbed numerous times
in the face and chest.

287
00:26:15,525 --> 00:26:18,926
Of course we'll have much more
on this horrific story as it develops.

288
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:21,759
But for now,
three people brutally murdered,

289
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:26,029
and a 10-year-old boy, Michael Myers,
being held in custody.

290
00:26:47,957 --> 00:26:50,824
<i>I'm standing outside
Smith's Grove Sanitarium</i>

291
00:26:50,894 --> 00:26:52,225
<i>where late last night,</i>

292
00:26:52,295 --> 00:26:55,025
<i>10-year-old Michael Myers was transferred</i>

293
00:26:55,098 --> 00:26:57,293
<i>after being found guilty
of first-degree murder.</i>

294
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:59,961
<i>Myers' verdict comes
after one of the lengthiest</i>

295
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:02,630
<i>and most expensive trials
in the state's history.</i>

296
00:27:02,706 --> 00:27:06,107
<i>In attendance during this trial,
Dr. Samuel Loomis.</i>

297
00:27:06,176 --> 00:27:08,576
<i>Loomis has now been appointed
by Judge Masterson</i>

298
00:27:08,645 --> 00:27:12,479
<i>to oversee Myers' care
while incarcerated here at Smith's Grove.</i>

299
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,308
Hello, hello, hello.

300
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:17,012
Can you talk in there?

301
00:27:17,087 --> 00:27:18,452
Hi, I'm Michael Myers.

302
00:27:18,521 --> 00:27:19,818
Okay, okay. That's fine.

303
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:22,824
That's good. That's good.
Okay, we're on.

304
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:24,689
How are you feeling today?

305
00:27:24,761 --> 00:27:25,750
Good.

306
00:27:27,764 --> 00:27:30,130
Could I ask you something?

307
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,395
You can ask me
whatever you want.

308
00:27:32,469 --> 00:27:33,936
That's why I'm here.

309
00:27:34,003 --> 00:27:37,439
If you have anything on your mind,
feel free... anything.

310
00:27:37,507 --> 00:27:38,974
Okay.

311
00:27:39,042 --> 00:27:41,169
Why do you talk so funny?

312
00:27:42,212 --> 00:27:43,270
Talk so funny?

313
00:27:43,346 --> 00:27:47,282
Tell me, Michael,

314
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,841
what do you remember about...

315
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,114
that night, Halloween?

316
00:27:54,657 --> 00:27:57,524
What do you mean,
like my costume and candy?

317
00:27:58,962 --> 00:28:01,863
So you remember nothing
about the killing?

318
00:28:04,033 --> 00:28:06,831
You remember nothing
about getting a knife?

319
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:10,432
- I didn't do that.
- Oh, okay.

320
00:28:10,507 --> 00:28:12,805
But you were covered in blood.
Whose blood was it?

321
00:28:12,876 --> 00:28:14,036
I don't know.

322
00:28:14,177 --> 00:28:16,611
Case: Michael Myers.

323
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:21,639
To the untrained eye,
there's nothing visually abnormal

324
00:28:21,718 --> 00:28:26,087
with this angelic young boy,
but one must remember not to be fooled

325
00:28:26,156 --> 00:28:29,387
by his calm, unassuming facade.

326
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:31,154
Can I go home today?

327
00:28:31,227 --> 00:28:33,320
No, not today.

328
00:28:33,396 --> 00:28:35,227
Tomorrow?

329
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:38,096
I don't know.
I have to talk to the doctor about that.

330
00:28:41,604 --> 00:28:43,834
- Hey, Mommy.
- Yeah.

331
00:28:43,907 --> 00:28:46,273
Is everyone at home okay?

332
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,775
Everything's okay at home.

333
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:55,277
Okay.

334
00:29:24,881 --> 00:29:25,870
Hey, Mikey.

335
00:29:25,949 --> 00:29:27,541
How you doing?

336
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:32,884
Look, you can't let those walls
get you down.

337
00:29:32,956 --> 00:29:34,924
Believe me, I know.

338
00:29:34,991 --> 00:29:36,891
I spent a little time behind walls.

339
00:29:38,328 --> 00:29:41,092
I know they can drive you crazy.

340
00:29:41,164 --> 00:29:43,064
You gotta look beyond the walls.

341
00:29:43,132 --> 00:29:46,863
You know,
learn to live inside your head.

342
00:29:46,936 --> 00:29:49,803
Hey, there's no walls
that can stop you there.

343
00:29:51,474 --> 00:29:53,908
All right, I gotta get back to work.

344
00:29:53,977 --> 00:29:55,774
Now you take it easy, Mikey.

345
00:30:05,121 --> 00:30:06,713
Look at my mask.

346
00:30:07,824 --> 00:30:10,315
Oh, wow. Beautiful. Yeah.

347
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:13,627
Why is it all black?

348
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,859
'Cause it's one of my favorite colors.

349
00:30:15,932 --> 00:30:18,492
Well, actually black isn't a color, is it?

350
00:30:18,568 --> 00:30:20,468
It's the absence of color.

351
00:30:20,536 --> 00:30:23,027
In the spectrum of colors,

352
00:30:23,106 --> 00:30:25,506
you go from black,
which is no color,

353
00:30:25,575 --> 00:30:28,408
all the way through to white,

354
00:30:28,478 --> 00:30:30,343
which is every color.

355
00:30:31,781 --> 00:30:33,578
So technically...

356
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:37,313
not that it really matters...
but black isn't a color.

357
00:30:38,688 --> 00:30:40,212
Why did you make it?

358
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,552
I have my secrets.

359
00:30:41,624 --> 00:30:44,024
Wait a minute.

360
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:47,324
I thought we had no secrets,
you and I.

361
00:30:47,397 --> 00:30:48,659
Because no one sees me.

362
00:30:48,731 --> 00:30:50,722
Yes, they do.
I see you every day.

363
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,201
Your mom, she comes every week.

364
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,966
Anybody else?

365
00:30:58,374 --> 00:30:59,363
No.

366
00:30:59,442 --> 00:31:01,569
<i>Michael has begun to obsess</i>

367
00:31:01,644 --> 00:31:04,943
<i>on the construction
of these primitive masks.</i>

368
00:31:05,014 --> 00:31:07,482
<i>It is the rare occasion
that he will allow himself</i>

369
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:09,381
<i>to be seen without one of these.</i>

370
00:31:09,452 --> 00:31:11,647
<i>Only during the weekly visits
from his mother</i>

371
00:31:11,721 --> 00:31:15,748
<i>does he show brief glimpses of the boy
he once may have been.</i>

372
00:31:24,367 --> 00:31:26,198
Do you like my mask?

373
00:31:28,538 --> 00:31:30,165
When did you make this?

374
00:31:30,239 --> 00:31:31,729
Just yesterday.

375
00:31:33,343 --> 00:31:36,506
I like the mask because it hides my face.

376
00:31:38,114 --> 00:31:40,344
I don't like you to hide your face.

377
00:31:40,416 --> 00:31:41,883
Take it off.

378
00:31:41,951 --> 00:31:43,748
It hides my ugliness.

379
00:31:44,887 --> 00:31:46,980
Sweetie, don't say that.
Take it off.

380
00:31:47,056 --> 00:31:48,546
You're not ugly.

381
00:31:50,093 --> 00:31:51,788
Don't talk like that, okay?

382
00:31:51,861 --> 00:31:53,123
Okay.

383
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:57,830
I miss you so much.

384
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,424
I miss you, too.

385
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,618
<i>Michael's so-called normal moments</i>

386
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,123
<i>are becoming fewer and fewer,</i>

387
00:32:22,191 --> 00:32:24,523
<i>and I'm particularly worried about this.</i>

388
00:32:24,594 --> 00:32:29,190
<i>I believe that these masks have
begun to create a mental sanctuary</i>

389
00:32:29,265 --> 00:32:33,793
<i>in which Michael can hide
within himself and from himself.</i>

392
00:32:42,945 --> 00:32:44,640
- I hate you!
- Let it out!

393
00:32:44,714 --> 00:32:46,306
Shut the fuck up!

394
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:48,282
I gotta get out of here.

395
00:32:48,351 --> 00:32:51,582
Just let me out!
I hate this world!

396
00:32:51,654 --> 00:32:54,316
- I don't want to be here anymore.
- I know. It's okay.

397
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,585
- I just want to go home.
- It's okay. It's okay.

398
00:32:56,659 --> 00:32:57,887
It's okay.

399
00:32:59,028 --> 00:33:01,292
Why can't I just go home?

400
00:33:01,364 --> 00:33:02,695
Okay.

401
00:33:02,765 --> 00:33:05,165
Okay. Okay. Okay.

402
00:33:05,234 --> 00:33:06,758
I'm afraid you can't go home.

403
00:33:06,836 --> 00:33:08,770
Why?

404
00:33:08,838 --> 00:33:10,533
Because you've done terrible things.

405
00:33:14,677 --> 00:33:16,542
Come here. Come on.

406
00:33:18,181 --> 00:33:20,615
It's okay. It's okay, Michael.

407
00:33:20,683 --> 00:33:22,446
<i>Michael's downward slide</i>

<i>I fear he's on the verge

410
00:33:29,058 --> 00:33:32,994
I managed to persuade the suits
to let you come outside

411
00:33:33,062 --> 00:33:34,825
and sit out in the garden.

412
00:33:34,897 --> 00:33:36,831
All right, gardens.

413
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:41,233
Hardly a charming place,
but at least there's a bit of greenery.

414
00:33:41,304 --> 00:33:44,273
But please, I mean,
if you don't communicate with me,

415
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,103
how can I help you?

416
00:33:46,175 --> 00:33:48,166
I'm here to help you.

417
00:33:48,244 --> 00:33:51,145
I feel an utter failure at the moment,

418
00:33:51,214 --> 00:33:54,081
that I just can't get through to you.

419
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,880
And you know, they're going
to see in my reports

420
00:33:56,953 --> 00:33:59,183
that you're not responding, and...

421
00:33:59,255 --> 00:34:01,450
you know, they may
take me off the case.

422
00:34:01,524 --> 00:34:03,321
I don't know. I hope not.

423
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:06,225
I need to get out of here.

424
00:34:08,531 --> 00:34:11,227
Yes, that's not going to happen
for a while, Michael.

425
00:34:14,871 --> 00:34:17,339
Michael, take off the mask.

426
00:34:20,676 --> 00:34:23,270
Honey, you don't look good.
You have to eat. Come on.

427
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,647
- Put my mask back on.
- Michael.

428
00:34:27,717 --> 00:34:29,844
Please put my mask back on.

<i>There's nothing left here now.</i>

434

Well, before I go,
I brought you something.

435
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,663
I found it. I thought you might like
to hang it up in your room.

436
00:35:22,238 --> 00:35:23,762
I thought you'd like it.

437
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,911
Well, I guess I'll see you next week.

438
00:35:35,985 --> 00:35:37,577
I'll walk you to the car.

I'm taking Mrs. Myers to her car.

441
00:35:47,997 --> 00:35:49,692
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

442
00:36:02,778 --> 00:36:03,767
Cute baby.

443
00:36:08,784 --> 00:36:10,775
Couldn't be related to you.

447
00:36:39,649 --> 00:36:41,014

450
00:38:47,877 --> 00:38:49,777
Goddamn it, we're gonna get
one thing straight.

451
00:38:49,845 --> 00:38:51,472
I don't work for you.

452
00:38:51,547 --> 00:38:53,674
You may have worked here
for many years

453
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:55,080
and done all manner of things,

454
00:38:55,151 --> 00:38:57,449
and I suppose that's because
you're a hard worker.

455
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,283
Most of you people are.

456
00:38:59,355 --> 00:39:01,482
All your women keep
your little bungalows clean,

457
00:39:01,557 --> 00:39:03,457
sweep off the dirt floors...

458
00:39:03,526 --> 00:39:05,391
keep the papooses in order and all...

459
00:39:05,528 --> 00:39:08,520
but I'm my own boss, all right?

460
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:10,895
I retire in about three months,

461
00:39:10,966 --> 00:39:13,491
and you're still gonna be here
for a long time.

462
00:39:13,569 --> 00:39:15,503
Now open the door.

463
00:39:15,571 --> 00:39:18,335
Don't take no orders from anybody.

464

465
00:39:32,421 --> 00:39:35,413
- Hey! Don't touch those.
- What?

466
00:39:35,491 --> 00:39:37,789
He doesn't like it
when you touch the masks.

467
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,385
God damn, I wouldn't want
the bum to freak out.

468

Sorry about these chains, Mikey.

469

What do you mean,
you're sorry about these chains?

470
00:39:45,468 --> 00:39:47,698
You got feelings for this big idiot,
is that what it is?

471
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:50,671
What's the dig goin' on, Ismael?
What the fuck, man?

472
00:39:50,739 --> 00:39:54,641
You know what? I've been taking care
of this kid for almost 20 years.

473
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,337
And me and him...

474
00:39:56,412 --> 00:39:58,039
You know what? Never mind.
Just shut up, man.

475
00:39:58,113 --> 00:40:00,047
Just keep your hands off his things.

476
00:40:00,115 --> 00:40:01,548
Don't look at me.

477
00:40:01,617 --> 00:40:05,109
I'll be a shitstorm
in your worst nightmare, motherfucker.

478
00:40:05,187 --> 00:40:08,315
I'll come in here and fuck this place up
one night, you watch.

479
00:40:17,733 --> 00:40:21,362
I really don't know what else to say, Michael.

480
00:40:21,437 --> 00:40:25,703
You haven't said a word for 15 years.

481
00:40:25,774 --> 00:40:28,641
Christ, that's a lifetime.

482
00:40:30,379 --> 00:40:35,043
That's nearly twice as long
as my first marriage.

483
00:40:35,117 --> 00:40:37,244
Wow.

484
00:40:37,319 --> 00:40:39,116
It's strange, Michael.

485
00:40:41,624 --> 00:40:44,252
In a weird way, you've become like...

486
00:40:45,928 --> 00:40:47,919
...like my best friend.

487
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:53,066
It just shows you how fucked up my life is.

488
00:40:55,237 --> 00:40:58,604
I've done all I possibly can for you.

489
00:40:58,674 --> 00:41:02,405
So I'm sorry to tell you

490
00:41:02,478 --> 00:41:05,106
that this is going to be my last day.

491
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,307
Michael...

492
00:41:07,416 --> 00:41:08,713
I have to move on.

493
00:41:10,886 --> 00:41:12,581
I'm sorry.

494
00:41:28,737 --> 00:41:30,705
Take care, Michael.

495
00:41:34,009 --> 00:41:35,636
Take care.

496
00:41:58,434 --> 00:42:00,800
These eyes will deceive you.

497
00:42:03,138 --> 00:42:06,039
They will destroy you.

498
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:09,805
They will take from you your innocence...

499
00:42:09,878 --> 00:42:12,108
your pride...

500
00:42:12,181 --> 00:42:15,309
and eventually your soul.

501
00:42:15,384 --> 00:42:20,549
These eyes do not see
what you and I see.

502
00:42:22,424 --> 00:42:27,589
Behind these eyes
one finds only blackness,

503
00:42:27,663 --> 00:42:30,655
the absence of light.

504
00:42:30,733 --> 00:42:34,931
These are the eyes...

505
00:42:35,004 --> 00:42:37,666
of a psychopath.

506
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,640
Michael was created

507
00:42:39,708 --> 00:42:41,903
by a perfect alignment

508
00:42:41,977 --> 00:42:45,140
of interior and exterior factors

509
00:42:45,214 --> 00:42:47,808
gone violently wrong...

510
00:42:47,883 --> 00:42:52,650
a perfect storm, if you will.

511
00:42:52,721 --> 00:42:55,417
Thus creating a psychopath

512
00:42:55,491 --> 00:42:58,221
that knows no boundaries...

513
00:42:58,293 --> 00:43:01,319
and has no boundaries.

514
00:43:08,904 --> 00:43:10,701
Kendall, I really don't appreciate

515
00:43:10,773 --> 00:43:12,536
being called out of
my favorite watering hole

516
00:43:12,608 --> 00:43:14,906
to come down on
the fuckin' graveyard shift.

517
00:43:14,977 --> 00:43:17,775
If you do me dirt on this one,
I'll fuckin' hold it against you.

518
00:43:17,846 --> 00:43:20,041
Hey, you know what? I'll fuck her.
You don't want to fuck her?

519
00:43:20,115 --> 00:43:22,140
I'll fuck her. Right here.

520
00:43:27,756 --> 00:43:30,452
Mikey, Mikey, Mikey.

521
00:43:30,526 --> 00:43:33,017
Here we go.
I want you to meet Cousin Noel.

522
00:43:37,299 --> 00:43:39,961
- Hi, there, sweetie. Hi.
- Huh?

523
00:43:40,035 --> 00:43:41,935
Oh, we're just here to look in on you.

524
00:43:42,004 --> 00:43:44,234
We know it's your first night and all.

525
00:43:44,306 --> 00:43:47,207
We just want to see how you are. Oh!

526
00:43:47,276 --> 00:43:49,540
- Aren't you a pretty little thing?
- Not bad, huh?

527
00:43:49,611 --> 00:43:51,238
We're just makin' sure everything's okay.

528
00:43:51,313 --> 00:43:53,838
Oh, now, we're okay. Hey.
Ooh, look at those little titties.

529
00:43:53,916 --> 00:43:55,349
You're right!
Oh, look at there.

530
00:43:55,517 --> 00:43:56,643
What else is under there?

531
00:43:56,719 --> 00:43:59,119
No, no, no, no, no.
Oh, yeah! Whoo!

532
00:43:59,188 --> 00:44:01,019
We got ourselves a fighter!

533
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:02,580
A fresh one!
You done good, cousin.

534
00:44:02,658 --> 00:44:03,784
Hah-hah!

535
00:44:03,859 --> 00:44:05,190
- I got an idea.
- Okay.

536
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:09,162
I got me a fuckin' bona fide,
sure as shit idea!

537
00:44:09,231 --> 00:44:11,825
- Keep her fuckin' quiet.
- God, shut up.

538
00:44:16,171 --> 00:44:18,696
Oh, Mikey, Mikey, Mikey, Mikey, Mikey.

539
00:44:18,774 --> 00:44:20,139
Hello, Mike!

540
00:44:22,745 --> 00:44:25,236
Hey, Mikey. We brought you
a little company.

541
00:44:25,314 --> 00:44:27,646
Yeah, we got you
some new, fresh meat, baby.

542
00:44:27,716 --> 00:44:30,184
Fuckin' bitch.
You want some of that?

543
00:44:30,252 --> 00:44:32,186
Come on, baby!

544
00:44:32,254 --> 00:44:33,721
Show us you're a man, huh?

545
00:44:33,789 --> 00:44:35,416
You want some fuckin' pussy?

546
00:44:35,491 --> 00:44:37,789
Yeah.

547
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,851
You want some fuckin' pussy, huh?

548
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:44,595
Yeah. Mm, that's good.
How 'bout some of that, killer?

549
00:44:44,666 --> 00:44:45,792
He ain't gonna do it.
Let me lick...

550
00:44:47,536 --> 00:44:48,798
Let me just...

551
00:44:48,871 --> 00:44:50,338
You wanna fuckin' fight, huh?

552
00:44:50,405 --> 00:44:53,169
- Come on, bitch.
- Fuck the shit outta her.

553
00:44:53,242 --> 00:44:55,335
- Come on! Get on her!
- Yeah, baby!

554
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:16,464
You fucking tard-ass faggot, come on!

555
00:45:16,532 --> 00:45:17,726
Yeah!

556
00:45:24,406 --> 00:45:25,839
You a faggot, boy?

557
00:45:29,678 --> 00:45:31,305
You a faggot, huh?

558
00:45:33,015 --> 00:45:34,107
What the fuck?

559
00:45:34,183 --> 00:45:36,674
Hey, you son of a bitch!

560
00:45:36,752 --> 00:45:38,276
Son of a bitch!
Let him go.

561
00:45:38,353 --> 00:45:39,877
Kendall!

562
00:45:42,724 --> 00:45:44,885
What the fuck, Mikey?
It's Kendall.

563
00:45:46,295 --> 00:45:47,489
It's Kendall, Mikey.

566
00:47:38,106 --> 00:47:41,564
Mikey, what are you doing
out of your room?

567
00:47:43,779 --> 00:47:44,939
Okay...

568
00:47:47,049 --> 00:47:49,017
Now, don't do nothing

569
00:47:49,084 --> 00:47:52,383
we're both gonna regret later,
okay, Mikey?

570
00:47:52,454 --> 00:47:55,582
I'm gonna have to get you back
into your room, okay now?

571
00:47:56,858 --> 00:47:59,088
Let me get these.

572
00:47:59,161 --> 00:48:00,890
I'm just gonna...

573
00:48:00,963 --> 00:48:02,931
get these handcuffs and...

574
00:48:04,499 --> 00:48:06,729
I'm gonna try to put these handcuffs
on you right now, Mikey.

575
00:48:06,802 --> 00:48:09,771
And then we'll get you back
into your own bed, okay?

576
00:48:24,086 --> 00:48:25,178
Mikey!

577
00:48:30,759 --> 00:48:32,954
I was good to you, Mikey.

578
00:48:47,109 --> 00:48:49,339
I was good to you, Mikey.

579
00:49:49,571 --> 00:49:50,560

<i>- Sam.
- Who is this?</i>

581
00:49:52,741 --> 00:49:54,003
Sam, it's Koplenson.

582
00:49:56,044 --> 00:49:57,033
Who?

583
00:49:57,112 --> 00:49:59,774
<i>Dr. Koplenson from Smith's Grove.</i>

He's out.

00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:02,674
Michael's out.

586
00:50:02,751 --> 00:50:05,447
Shit. What?

587
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,648
He broke out a few hours ago.

588
00:50:08,723 --> 00:50:11,715
Sam, it's a...
it's a fucking massacre.

589
00:50:13,595 --> 00:50:16,155
I'm coming right away.
All right.

590
00:50:18,033 --> 00:50:19,432

Grizzley's back in town.
Who's got the Cracker Jacks?

597
00:50:55,036 --> 00:50:57,061
Grizzley's back!

I got a taco deluxe supreme

so I'm going to be a while.

612
00:52:07,909 --> 00:52:13,074
So do you mind waiting somewhere else
and let me pass this beast in peace?

613

Look, brother...

you better take it on the arches

00:54:49,037 --> 00:54:50,971
Want a screwdriver, Mommy?
You want a hammer?

646
00:54:51,272 --> 00:54:52,603
Look at this, Mom. Oh!

647
00:54:52,674 --> 00:54:54,471
- Laurie, stop!
- I'm sorry. Okay.

648
00:54:54,542 --> 00:54:57,102
- Are you eating?
- No, I'll get something at school.

649
00:54:57,178 --> 00:54:58,873
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, sure.

650
00:54:58,947 --> 00:55:02,212
Just let the faceless marauding
corporate monsters of America

651
00:55:02,283 --> 00:55:03,978
destroy everything
beautiful about this town.

652
00:55:04,052 --> 00:55:07,385
Corporate monsters or not,
Epic Mart's a lot cheaper.

653
00:55:07,455 --> 00:55:09,616
Oh, man, I gotta get out of here.

654
00:55:13,528 --> 00:55:16,520
- Thanks again for dropping that thing off.
- No sweat, Dad.

655
00:55:16,598 --> 00:55:19,158
Just shove the envelope
inside the mail slot, okay?

656
00:55:19,234 --> 00:55:20,462
Yeah, Dad, I know.

657
00:55:20,535 --> 00:55:22,025
They're coming by to look at it later, honey.

658
00:55:22,103 --> 00:55:23,092
- So, it's very important that...
- Dad, okay.

659
00:55:23,171 --> 00:55:25,401
<i>I understand.
Muy importante.</i>

660
00:55:25,473 --> 00:55:26,531
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

661
00:55:26,608 --> 00:55:27,700
Have a good day.

662
00:55:27,776 --> 00:55:31,542
Mason, you forgot your briefcase, honey.

663
00:55:31,613 --> 00:55:33,774
- Ah, shit.
- Ah, shit.

664
00:55:33,848 --> 00:55:35,281
I feel like "What round is it?"

665
00:55:38,019 --> 00:55:39,145
Yeah.

666
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:43,213
Oh, uh, you think you could...
glue Mr. Bones' arms on or something?

667
00:55:43,291 --> 00:55:46,624
- Have a good day, baby.
- Yeah. Top on my priority list.

668
00:55:50,165 --> 00:55:51,154
Hey, Laurie!

669
00:55:51,232 --> 00:55:52,290
- Wait up!
- Oh, God.

670
00:55:52,367 --> 00:55:55,268
- Leave me alone, Tommy.
- Wait.

671
00:55:55,336 --> 00:55:58,305
Definition: Stop walking.

672
00:55:58,373 --> 00:56:01,740
- Can I ask you something serious?
- Sure, why not?

673
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:04,176
Did you ever hear
about the Mexican Wolf Man?

674
00:56:04,245 --> 00:56:06,304
- No.
- Yeah, well, he's real.

675
00:56:06,381 --> 00:56:07,905
- I saw him on TV last night...
- Yeah.

676
00:56:07,982 --> 00:56:11,748
And his name's Danny, and his face
is completely covered with hair.

677
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:13,515
And he likes soccer.
I swear it! They showed...

678
00:56:13,588 --> 00:56:14,646
- Okay.
- He's a wolf!

679
00:56:14,722 --> 00:56:16,986
Tommy, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

680
00:56:17,058 --> 00:56:18,423
Lay off the candy corn, kid.

681
00:56:18,493 --> 00:56:21,018
Stop acting like I'm crazy. It's true!

682
00:56:21,095 --> 00:56:23,120
Tommy, I'm your babysitter.
You're crazy.

683
00:56:23,198 --> 00:56:25,689
- I know this. You're crazy.
- Ooohhh!

684
00:57:52,349 --> 00:57:54,614
All right, gotta make a stop here.

685
00:57:54,686 --> 00:57:57,879
Whoa! What are you, insane?

686
00:57:57,952 --> 00:58:00,386
Oh, my gosh, Tommy,
I'm not even listening to you.

687
00:58:00,454 --> 00:58:02,480
You'd better listen to me.

688
00:58:02,558 --> 00:58:03,751
He's right there.

689
00:58:03,824 --> 00:58:05,918
What are you, crazy?
You can't go in there.

690
00:58:05,993 --> 00:58:07,687
Oh, yes, I can.

691
00:58:07,761 --> 00:58:09,991
Hold my books, please?

692
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:13,990
That's the devil's house.
The Boogey Man lives in there.

693
00:58:14,066 --> 00:58:16,123
Yeah.
Oh, no, Tommy.

694
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,293
Don't even joke about it.
I'm serious.

695
00:58:18,368 --> 00:58:20,459
Oh, you're scaring me.

696
00:58:20,537 --> 00:58:23,766
The Boogey Man will get me
or Danny the Wolf Man.

697
00:58:30,277 --> 00:58:31,904
Oh, no, Tommy.

698
00:58:31,979 --> 00:58:34,741
Oh, no!

699
00:58:34,813 --> 00:58:36,441
Oh, no, it's pulling me...

700
00:58:36,516 --> 00:58:39,004
Oh, no, Tommy, it's pulling me in!

701
00:58:39,082 --> 00:58:41,017
Ha ha ha.

702
00:58:41,718 --> 00:58:43,186
It was just a joke. Chill.

703
00:58:43,254 --> 00:58:45,153
I wish it wasn't.

704
00:58:45,222 --> 00:58:47,053
Come on, hurry up.

705
00:58:47,123 --> 00:58:49,316
Chill, spazz-monkey.

706
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:50,585
Thanks.

707
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:55,629
That's no place to screw around,
Laurie.

708
00:58:55,696 --> 00:58:58,221
- It's not a big deal.
- Not a big deal?

709
00:58:58,298 --> 00:59:00,457
Do you know whose house that is?

710
00:59:00,532 --> 00:59:01,830
Come on.

711
00:59:01,901 --> 00:59:03,993
- It's going to be fine.
- Yeah.

712
00:59:04,069 --> 00:59:05,500
What if something happens?

713
00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:08,332
- Laurie, what is going to happen?
- I don't know.

714
00:59:08,404 --> 00:59:10,065
It's going to be fine.

715
00:59:10,139 --> 00:59:12,368
What is going to be fine?

716
00:59:12,441 --> 00:59:15,773
Annie wants me to pretend
to baby-sit Lindsey Wallace,

717
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:19,403
then sneak out and dump her with me
so she can go and see Paul.

718
00:59:19,479 --> 00:59:20,845
Sounds like
one of my crafty ideas.

719
00:59:20,915 --> 00:59:22,142
- Yeah.
- I like it.

720
00:59:22,215 --> 00:59:25,081
Anyway, I thought Paul was, like, grounded
for trashing his dad's motorcycle.

721
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:27,140
Oh, yeah.
No, he was, but he got out of it.

722
00:59:27,218 --> 00:59:28,481
- You know.
- Yeah.

723
00:59:28,553 --> 00:59:30,816
Please?

724
00:59:30,887 --> 00:59:32,252
What if they come home early?

725
00:59:32,322 --> 00:59:34,983
Dude, they are not
going to come home early.

726
00:59:35,056 --> 00:59:36,854
Okay? Mrs. Wallace is a lush.

727
00:59:36,925 --> 00:59:39,917
They're going to be out all night
getting hammered.

728
00:59:39,995 --> 00:59:42,860
Yeah. Annie, I really hate lying.
You know that.

729
00:59:42,929 --> 00:59:45,489
God, what are you, Mother Teresa?

730
00:59:45,565 --> 00:59:46,897
- No.
- Yes, she is.

731
00:59:46,967 --> 00:59:48,593
Look at her.
She's like a little angel.

732
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:52,501
- She's Mother-fucking Teresa.
- Stop. I am not!

733
00:59:52,571 --> 00:59:54,059
Please?

734
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:58,774
- All right, I'll do it.
- Yes!

735
00:59:58,842 --> 01:00:00,036
You owe me big time.

736
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:02,044
- I love you.
- I love you.

737
01:00:04,345 --> 01:00:08,144
Did you know that ethyl alcohol
boils at 78.5 degrees Celsius?

738
01:00:08,215 --> 01:00:09,683
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

739
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:11,216
That's pretty cool, right?

740
01:00:12,218 --> 01:00:13,311
Call me back.

741
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,551
This is all your fault.

742
01:00:18,622 --> 01:00:20,452
I mean, you're responsible.

743
01:00:21,892 --> 01:00:26,918
I cannot be responsible
for everything that goes on in here.

744
01:00:26,995 --> 01:00:28,463
- What about you?
- No, no, no, no.

745
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:30,497
You're not pinning this on me.

746
01:00:30,564 --> 01:00:34,260
- He was your patient, Doctor.
- Was my patient.

747
01:00:34,334 --> 01:00:37,791
Look, all you guys had to do
was to play zoo-keeper.

748
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:41,327
Just keep the monkeyhouse locked
until the monkey died of old age.

749
01:00:41,406 --> 01:00:42,872
How difficult is that?

750
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:46,772
Christ, you can barely tell
he's breathing half the time.

751
01:00:46,844 --> 01:00:50,643
He's been like a comatose kitty
for 15 years.

752
01:00:50,714 --> 01:00:53,545
If our security wasn't sufficient, Sammy,

753
01:00:53,615 --> 01:00:55,412
you should have warned us.

754
01:00:55,483 --> 01:00:59,747
I see. So you're just going
to wash your hands of the whole thing.

755
01:00:59,819 --> 01:01:02,652
You know, you two make me sick.

756
01:01:10,794 --> 01:01:15,127
"He is mad that trusts
in the tameness of a wolf. "

757
01:01:16,833 --> 01:01:19,458
We've given the authorities
his complete profile.

758
01:01:19,533 --> 01:01:23,024
Two road blocks and an all-points bulletin
wouldn't stop a 5-year-old.

759
01:01:23,102 --> 01:01:24,765
Well, what do you want us to do?

760
01:01:24,838 --> 01:01:26,827
Yes. I mean,
what do you want us to do?

761
01:01:28,308 --> 01:01:30,274
I want you to get on the phone,

762
01:01:30,342 --> 01:01:34,038
and I want you to tell them
who broke out of here last night.

763
01:01:34,111 --> 01:01:37,568
And I want you to tell them
exactly where he's going.

764
01:01:37,647 --> 01:01:39,113
Christ, we don't know where he's going.

765
01:01:39,181 --> 01:01:41,274
It must be great living in denial.

766
01:01:41,350 --> 01:01:42,941
I must try it sometime.

767
01:01:43,017 --> 01:01:46,713
Look, you and that army
of shirt-tuckers up there,

768
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:48,754
you know damn well where he's going.

769
01:01:50,522 --> 01:01:51,547
And where is that?

770
01:01:54,927 --> 01:01:56,756
Haddonfield!

771
01:01:56,827 --> 01:01:59,591
Haddonfield's a hundred miles
away from here.

772
01:02:00,863 --> 01:02:02,127
This is so fucked.

773
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,324
What, me suspended from the squad?

774
01:02:04,399 --> 01:02:05,594
I don't mean to sound conceited,

775
01:02:05,669 --> 01:02:07,828
but I'm, like, the fucking hottest
cheerleader they've got.

776
01:02:07,902 --> 01:02:09,632
Yeah, Lynda,
that doesn't sound conceited.

777
01:02:09,705 --> 01:02:11,603
What, so now nobody
can take a joke anymore?

778
01:02:11,671 --> 01:02:13,300
- What did you say?
- Check it.

779
01:02:13,375 --> 01:02:15,966
So Lady Fuck-face gives us
three new cheers to learn,

780
01:02:16,041 --> 01:02:19,999
so I'm like, "Hey, why don't we just
rock it commando, flash some snatch?

781
01:02:20,077 --> 01:02:22,136
And maybe nobody will notice
we're doing the same old tired cheers. "

782
01:02:22,213 --> 01:02:24,145
- Oh, you didn't.
- Oh, yeah, I did.

783
01:02:24,213 --> 01:02:25,204
- Yeah, you did.
- Yeah.

784
01:02:25,282 --> 01:02:26,975
You know what that
dried-up fucking bitch did?

785
01:02:27,049 --> 01:02:29,745
- What?
- Calls my dad and tells him what I said.

786
01:02:29,818 --> 01:02:30,806
- Yeah.
- Oh, my gosh.

787
01:02:30,885 --> 01:02:34,116
That C-U-N-T, yeah,
needs to get laid.

788
01:02:34,187 --> 01:02:35,815
What did your dad say?

789
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:37,117
Oh, who cares?

790
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:40,955
I'll just give him the little sweetie-pants
princess suck-up routine.

791
01:02:41,026 --> 01:02:44,257
Daddy's little pookie would never
say something like that.

792
01:02:44,330 --> 01:02:46,091
Gosh, ever since your parents split up,

793
01:02:46,163 --> 01:02:48,223
you have your dad
wrapped around your little finger.

794
01:02:48,298 --> 01:02:50,526
Totally wrapped.

795
01:02:50,601 --> 01:02:53,124
- Hey, bitches!
- Hey, Annie.

796
01:02:53,201 --> 01:02:56,863
- Thanks for waiting for me.
- Whatever. Hurry your ass up.

797
01:02:56,937 --> 01:02:58,666
God.

798
01:02:58,739 --> 01:03:01,970
Hey, I heard about your
little cheerleading incident.

799
01:03:02,042 --> 01:03:04,270
Yeah, I'm totally famous.

800
01:03:04,343 --> 01:03:05,971
You're totally a slut.

801
01:03:06,045 --> 01:03:07,568
Yeah.

802
01:03:07,646 --> 01:03:09,477
Anyway, today in class,
in French class,

803
01:03:09,548 --> 01:03:11,515
Mr. Leclerc was totally
flirting with me.

804
01:03:11,582 --> 01:03:15,482
- God, here we go!
- We were conjugating the verb "to want. "

805
01:03:15,551 --> 01:03:19,316
<i>- Because he so wants you!
- Je veuxl Je veuxl</i>

806
01:03:19,387 --> 01:03:22,185
- Oh, my gosh.
- Bare Leclerc.

807
01:03:22,257 --> 01:03:23,883
Bare Leclerc wants me.

808
01:03:23,956 --> 01:03:25,857
I think that guy's watching us.

809
01:03:25,926 --> 01:03:27,586
- What guy?
- That guy over there.

810
01:03:27,659 --> 01:03:28,752
Yeah?

811
01:03:28,828 --> 01:03:30,624
- Oh, please.
- I saw him outside school earlier.

812
01:03:30,695 --> 01:03:32,720
Probably just some pervert
cruising school poontang.

813
01:03:32,798 --> 01:03:34,856
Yeah, wait. Watch this.

814
01:03:34,932 --> 01:03:36,456
Hey, freak!

815
01:03:36,534 --> 01:03:38,398
Hey, freak, you want
some of the young stuff?

816
01:03:38,468 --> 01:03:40,368
You like that?
Well, come and get it.

817
01:03:40,437 --> 01:03:41,563
- Hey!
- Lynda, stop.

818
01:03:41,638 --> 01:03:43,969
Hey, asshole.
My daddy's the sheriff.

819
01:03:44,039 --> 01:03:46,437
Huh? Why don't you go crawl back
under your fucking rock?

820
01:03:46,506 --> 01:03:49,067
- Yeah, whatever.
- See, I told you.

821
01:03:49,143 --> 01:03:51,077
He's just some
stupid fucking pervert.

822
01:03:51,144 --> 01:03:53,168
- Total pervert.
- Gosh, you guys are crazy.

823
01:03:53,245 --> 01:03:54,508
That guy could have been dangerous.

824
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:55,807
- Oh, God.
- Whatever.

825
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:57,676
- What is he going to do?
- I don't know.

826
01:03:57,748 --> 01:04:01,240
Oh, my God.
You should date him!

827
01:04:02,686 --> 01:04:04,619
- You should!
- You guys!

828
01:04:04,687 --> 01:04:05,780
Come on, let's go get something...

829
01:04:06,989 --> 01:04:09,012
- Oh, no, 5-0.
- Hey.

830
01:04:09,089 --> 01:04:10,648
Hi, Dad.

831
01:04:10,725 --> 01:04:12,248
Hey, Mr. Brackett.

832
01:04:12,326 --> 01:04:15,227
- Nice furry hat, Mr. Brackett.
- Thank you.

833
01:04:15,296 --> 01:04:16,556
What's up, Dad?

834
01:04:16,628 --> 01:04:19,324
I'm on my way home.
Anybody want a ride?

835
01:04:19,398 --> 01:04:20,866
Yeah. Hell, yeah, I'll take a ride.

836
01:04:20,934 --> 01:04:22,092
- No.
- You guys?

837
01:04:22,166 --> 01:04:23,656
Bacon-mobiles make me nauseous.

838
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:25,292
- Nice.
- Bye, Annie.

839
01:04:25,369 --> 01:04:26,835
- See you later.
- Bye, guys.

840
01:04:26,903 --> 01:04:28,768
Hey, kiddo.

841
01:04:31,673 --> 01:04:35,074
- Kind of a drag having a pig as a dad.
- Nah, I like him.

842
01:04:35,143 --> 01:04:37,610
Yeah? Do you think
he was flirting with me?

843
01:04:37,678 --> 01:04:39,510
- You are so demented.
- Totally.

844
01:04:39,581 --> 01:04:41,877
- Yeah. See ya.
- Bye.

845
01:05:17,875 --> 01:05:20,708
I hate you!

846
01:05:25,846 --> 01:05:27,972
Aw, how cute.

847
01:05:28,047 --> 01:05:30,208
Would you please help me
with this stupid thing?

848
01:05:30,283 --> 01:05:32,115
Okay, okay, okay.

849
01:05:32,186 --> 01:05:35,277
Jeez. Mom, why do you
deal with this every year?

850
01:05:35,353 --> 01:05:37,412
Because for some unbelievable reason,

851
01:05:37,488 --> 01:05:40,252
your father likes it.

852
01:05:40,324 --> 01:05:42,347
- The feet look like the hands...
- It's not working.

853
01:05:42,424 --> 01:05:45,620
And the hands like the feet,
and I can't get the thing in the hole, and...

854
01:05:45,693 --> 01:05:48,719
- Oh, I can't get it!
- Calm down, I'm helping...

855
01:05:48,796 --> 01:05:50,160
Oh, I got it.

856
01:05:51,733 --> 01:05:53,198
- You got it?
- Will you try and get those right?

857
01:05:53,266 --> 01:05:54,735
Okay, I'll try.

858
01:05:54,802 --> 01:05:55,960
Oh, jeez.

859
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:59,198
I've been out here
for two hours doing this.

860
01:05:59,272 --> 01:06:01,238
There.

861
01:06:01,372 --> 01:06:03,772
- Hey, do you want me to get...
- Just hang himself. No!

862
01:06:03,841 --> 01:06:06,571
I'm still upset about the whole
bagel thing this morning,

863
01:06:06,644 --> 01:06:07,632
if you want to know the truth.

864
01:06:07,710 --> 01:06:08,869
Mom, that was a joke.

865
01:06:08,944 --> 01:06:10,310
- Oh, yeah. Well, let me tell you.
- It was a joke.

866
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:12,243
There are some things
moms don't need to hear.

867
01:06:12,313 --> 01:06:13,906
- Yeah, I'm 17.
- I know you're 17.

868
01:06:13,982 --> 01:06:16,777
You're the best, Mom.

869
01:06:22,254 --> 01:06:24,083
Yeah, it's right over here.

870
01:06:25,491 --> 01:06:27,389
Yeah. Hello?

871
01:06:27,457 --> 01:06:29,857
Yes, uh, Sheriff Brackett, please.

872
01:06:29,927 --> 01:06:33,794
Dr. Samuel Loomis.
Yeah. Hello? He...

873
01:06:33,863 --> 01:06:38,423
Oh, sh... ugh!
Can I borrow your cell phone?

874
01:06:38,499 --> 01:06:41,059
This thing's about as useful
as a row of Christmas puddings.

875
01:06:41,135 --> 01:06:43,124
Oh, no. I don't have one.

876
01:06:43,203 --> 01:06:44,760
Causes brain cancer.

877
01:06:44,837 --> 01:06:46,564
Oh, yeah. Right.

878
01:06:46,704 --> 01:06:50,071
You know, I remember this mess
just like it happened yesterday?

879
01:06:50,141 --> 01:06:51,507
It was tragic.

880
01:06:51,577 --> 01:06:53,372
The poor woman,
I guess she couldn't stand the stress

881
01:06:53,443 --> 01:06:56,378
of being labeled "Satan's mother. "

882
01:06:56,446 --> 01:06:58,880
I think she blew her fucking head off.

883
01:06:58,949 --> 01:07:00,778
I'm still amazed.

884
01:07:00,848 --> 01:07:04,339
A young boy like that
butchering all those people.

885
01:07:04,418 --> 01:07:08,285
And the doctor involved...
I think he wrote a book or something.

886
01:07:08,354 --> 01:07:09,845
Fucking blood money.

887
01:07:09,922 --> 01:07:11,685
Yeah, I read that book.
It was a masterpiece.

888
01:07:11,757 --> 01:07:14,419
- Now, are we close?
- Yes, it's just here. I gu...

889
01:07:15,926 --> 01:07:18,088
- Goddamn son of a bitch!
- What?

890
01:07:18,163 --> 01:07:20,960
Those fucking kids!
Jesus Christ!

891
01:07:21,031 --> 01:07:24,625
Don't they think I have anything better to do
with my time than clean up this shit?

892
01:07:24,701 --> 01:07:26,691
Fucking little idiots! God damn it!

893
01:07:26,768 --> 01:07:28,429
Where the hell are you going?

894
01:07:30,670 --> 01:07:34,231
Who would do sick shit like this?

895
01:07:34,306 --> 01:07:37,139
I think I know whose grave that is.

896
01:08:08,098 --> 01:08:11,625
Dude, it fucking totally sucks
that they're selling this place.

897
01:08:11,701 --> 01:08:14,225
It's reduced.
Maybe I can buy it.

898
01:08:14,303 --> 01:08:17,170
Yeah, with like, your $10 you have
in your piggy bank?

899
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:20,931
It's a shithole anyway.

900
01:08:21,009 --> 01:08:22,497
I'm going to miss it.

901
01:08:22,575 --> 01:08:23,633
Don't worry, dude.

902
01:08:23,709 --> 01:08:26,074
We'll find another house to party in.

903
01:08:26,144 --> 01:08:29,113
Besides, I'm gonna
get the van all jacked up.

904
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:31,942
You're gonna want to spend
more time in there anyway.

905
01:08:49,428 --> 01:08:50,828
Wait, wait!

906
01:08:50,897 --> 01:08:53,056
Wait, just like that.

907
01:08:53,131 --> 01:08:55,565
Oh, God.

908
01:08:55,633 --> 01:08:56,724
Oh, wait. Wait.

909
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:57,891
Right there, right there.

910
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:00,765
- Hold on!
- Wait, my calf is cramping, man.

911
01:09:00,836 --> 01:09:02,565
Why'd you stop?
Oh, God...

912
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:04,501
Oh, fuck.

913
01:09:09,308 --> 01:09:11,367
A fucking little warning would be nice.

914
01:09:11,444 --> 01:09:14,106
- Fuck.
- I'm sorry.

915
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:16,147
Jesus.

916
01:09:19,917 --> 01:09:22,282
- Get me another beer.
- You get it.

917
01:09:22,352 --> 01:09:24,913
I'm the one that just did all the heavy lifting.

918
01:09:26,722 --> 01:09:28,188
All right, I'll go.

919
01:09:32,461 --> 01:09:37,089
So, seriously, on a scale from 1 to 10,
should I have a 5?

920
01:09:37,163 --> 01:09:41,565
How about... zero?

921
01:09:41,633 --> 01:09:42,792
- More like...
- Zero.

922
01:09:42,866 --> 01:09:44,095
More like zero plus 11.

923
01:10:23,529 --> 01:10:25,725
- Hello?
- Yo, Mama.

924
01:10:25,799 --> 01:10:27,560
What up, dude?

925
01:10:27,632 --> 01:10:30,430
<i>- Nothing much.
- Oh, what's wrong?</i>

926
01:10:30,502 --> 01:10:33,027
I was just thinking about
what Annie said earlier today,

927
01:10:33,105 --> 01:10:35,434
concerning my so-called
"cheerleading incident. "

928
01:10:35,504 --> 01:10:37,336
I don't know.
It's kind of bumming me out.

929
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:42,742
Fuck, dude, who put
all the empties back in here?

930
01:10:44,079 --> 01:10:45,409
You don't think that, do you?

931
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:46,740
Lynda, I don't think you're a slut.

932
01:10:46,812 --> 01:10:48,247
Come on, that's ridiculous.

933
01:10:48,316 --> 01:10:50,943
I don't give a shit what Annie thinks anyway.

934
01:10:51,017 --> 01:10:52,143
But I care what you think.

935
01:10:52,651 --> 01:10:54,276
Aww!

936
01:11:09,865 --> 01:11:10,854
Fuck!

937
01:11:12,398 --> 01:11:13,865
What... What the f...

938
01:11:56,632 --> 01:12:00,123
Jesus, Bob, could you move
your pokey ass a little slower?

939
01:12:00,201 --> 01:12:01,531
Well, could you?

940
01:12:06,438 --> 01:12:07,837
Well, that's cute.

941
01:12:09,239 --> 01:12:12,072
See anything you like?

942
01:12:20,414 --> 01:12:22,076
Okay, enough.

943
01:12:22,150 --> 01:12:23,582
Joke's over.

944
01:12:23,651 --> 01:12:25,278
Beer, please.

945
01:12:30,088 --> 01:12:33,421
Hey, Casper the Friendly Asshole Ghost,
hand me my beer.

946
01:12:35,894 --> 01:12:38,020
Well, fucking hand it over, dip-shit.

947
01:12:40,996 --> 01:12:43,829
Why do you have to become
such a fucking jerk every time we do it?

948
01:12:43,899 --> 01:12:46,661
You think you'd be grateful
that I let you touch me with that thing.

949
01:12:46,733 --> 01:12:48,099
And anyway, you're not a zero.

950
01:12:48,169 --> 01:12:50,635
You're a fucking minus 5 or something.

951
01:12:50,703 --> 01:12:51,966
Whatever.

952
01:12:52,039 --> 01:12:53,596
What'd you do to this beer?

953
01:13:36,038 --> 01:13:38,435
What about this big one here?
That looks perfect.

954
01:13:38,504 --> 01:13:40,030
- You mean, like, this one here?
- Yeah, that one.

955
01:13:40,107 --> 01:13:43,006
- Yes, yes, that's lovely.
- .22 Smith & Wesson.

956
01:13:43,075 --> 01:13:44,906
- That's good.
- Yeah.

957
01:13:44,977 --> 01:13:47,069
That's okay if you want to just piss it off.

958
01:13:47,146 --> 01:13:50,876
If you want to blow its fucking head off...

959
01:13:50,949 --> 01:13:52,245
this is what you want.

960
01:13:52,315 --> 01:13:54,179
.357 Magnum.

961
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:56,616
Wolff mainspring, polygonal rifling.

962
01:13:56,685 --> 01:13:58,151
Beautiful, beautiful.
Poly what?

963
01:13:58,219 --> 01:14:00,948
- Muzzle velocity of 1,450 feet per second.
- Great, just wrap it up.

964
01:14:01,021 --> 01:14:02,354
- That's fine.
- Okay, okay.

965
01:14:02,424 --> 01:14:04,014
- Take it easy.
- Thank you. Yes.

966
01:14:04,091 --> 01:14:05,182
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

967
01:14:05,258 --> 01:14:06,749
If you could just wrap it up,
that'd be great.

968
01:14:06,827 --> 01:14:08,315
- Thank you.
- What are we hunting?

969
01:14:08,393 --> 01:14:12,453
- Girls, you look so beautiful.
- Little princesses.

970
01:14:12,529 --> 01:14:13,520
- Trick or treat.
- Here you go.

971
01:14:13,599 --> 01:14:14,622
- Thank you.
- Here's some candy.

972
01:14:14,699 --> 01:14:16,995
- Oh, Happy Halloween.
- You, too.

973
01:14:17,066 --> 01:14:19,727
- Bye, you guys.
- Thank you. Bye.

974
01:14:21,305 --> 01:14:23,100
So cute.

975
01:14:23,171 --> 01:14:25,765
I cannot believe you're graduating this year.

976
01:14:25,841 --> 01:14:28,571
I remember when you used
to run around looking like that.

977
01:14:28,644 --> 01:14:30,576
Mom, I was never a princess.

978
01:14:30,644 --> 01:14:32,908
Last thing I was at their age
was dead Little Red Riding Hood.

979
01:14:32,979 --> 01:14:34,275
You were this beautiful ballerina...

980
01:14:34,346 --> 01:14:37,110
No, you bought me the blood
and you gave me the cuts.

981
01:14:37,182 --> 01:14:38,545
"My costume's too tight. "

982
01:14:38,615 --> 01:14:40,208
- You don't remember that?
- I never wore a tutu.

983
01:14:40,285 --> 01:14:42,012
You getting many kids?

984
01:14:42,084 --> 01:14:44,951
Only two so far.

985
01:14:45,021 --> 01:14:47,456
Listen...

986
01:14:47,524 --> 01:14:48,512
be careful tonight.

987
01:14:48,590 --> 01:14:49,578
I know.

988
01:14:49,657 --> 01:14:52,058
A lot of nut cases come out on Halloween.

989
01:14:52,127 --> 01:14:55,323
It's, uh...
What was it you told me to say?

990
01:14:56,796 --> 01:14:59,458
- Amateur night.
- Yeah, that's right. Amateur night.

991
01:14:59,532 --> 01:15:01,657
Dad, I'm just going to be babysitting.

992
01:15:01,731 --> 01:15:03,325
- What's the worst thing I could do?
- All right, okay.

993
01:15:03,402 --> 01:15:05,095
- I'm just saying.
- Nice.

994
01:15:05,168 --> 01:15:06,193
- All right.
- Sorry.

995
01:15:06,270 --> 01:15:07,827
- Aah!
- Mom, st...

996
01:15:12,106 --> 01:15:13,836
Hi, Mr. And Mrs. Strode!

997
01:15:13,908 --> 01:15:15,034
- Hey, Annie.
- Hey.

998
01:15:15,109 --> 01:15:16,166
How's your dad?

999
01:15:16,243 --> 01:15:18,837
Oh, you know, same as always.

1000
01:15:18,912 --> 01:15:21,107
- You know what that means?
- Mm-hmm.

1001
01:15:22,782 --> 01:15:24,247
Yeah. Love you guys!

1002
01:15:24,315 --> 01:15:26,648
- Love you, too!
- Bye-bye!

1003
01:15:26,718 --> 01:15:27,978
Gonna give me some lovin'?

1004
01:15:28,051 --> 01:15:32,352
I'll give you some lovin' later, but first
you're going to talk about the vacation.

1005
01:15:32,423 --> 01:15:35,787
I'm going to go build a fire.

1006
01:15:35,856 --> 01:15:37,552
Vacation.

1007
01:15:37,626 --> 01:15:40,094
I hate vacation. Let's stay home.

1008
01:16:12,451 --> 01:16:13,749
Aaahhh!

1009
01:16:40,705 --> 01:16:42,695
No! No!

1010
01:16:42,773 --> 01:16:46,037
You leave my baby alone, you...

1011
01:17:06,125 --> 01:17:08,591
Okay, Tommy,
here's your jelly sandwich,

1012
01:17:08,658 --> 01:17:10,683
hold the peanut butter.

1013
01:17:10,761 --> 01:17:11,988
Good.

1014
01:17:12,061 --> 01:17:13,961
You know, if you listened to me
the first time,

1015
01:17:14,030 --> 01:17:15,519
you wouldn't had to have made it twice.

1016
01:17:18,766 --> 01:17:21,235
- Laurie?
- What?

1017
01:17:22,002 --> 01:17:23,935
Is the Boogey Man real?

1018
01:17:24,003 --> 01:17:26,300
Why are you so obsessed
with the Boogey Man, Tommy?

1019
01:17:26,371 --> 01:17:29,670
- Well, I hear things at school.
- Like what?

1020
01:17:29,741 --> 01:17:32,471
Well, I heard that on Halloween night,

1021
01:17:32,544 --> 01:17:36,001
the Boogey Man sneaks out
and attacks kids who don't believe.

1022
01:17:37,846 --> 01:17:39,872
You know what, Tommy?

1023
01:17:39,949 --> 01:17:41,915
It is true.

1024
01:17:41,983 --> 01:17:44,645
He likes to eat little boys like you.

1025
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,312
Oh, my God!
The Boogey Man's here!

1026
01:17:48,388 --> 01:17:50,082
We're going to die!

1027
01:17:51,557 --> 01:17:53,114
Hold that thought.

1028
01:17:53,191 --> 01:17:55,386
That's not appropriate
babysitter behavior, Laurie.

1029
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:56,687
Hello?

1030
01:17:57,393 --> 01:17:58,828
<i>Shut up.</i>

1031
01:17:58,897 --> 01:18:01,727
<i>- My parents will hear about this one.
- Yo, it's me. Hey.</i>

1032
01:18:01,797 --> 01:18:04,095
So the Wallaces are finally out of my face.

1033
01:18:04,166 --> 01:18:05,757
I just talked to Paul.
He's on his way over.

1034
01:18:05,833 --> 01:18:11,327
So I'm finishing making the Queen of Sheba
her popcorn, and then I will be over.

1035
01:18:11,404 --> 01:18:14,532
I have some fun and exciting news for you,
so I'll see you in a few minutes.

1036
01:18:14,607 --> 01:18:16,038
Okay, bye.

1037
01:18:17,776 --> 01:18:20,106
- Guess what, Tommy.
- What?

1038
01:18:20,177 --> 01:18:22,668
Lindsey Wallace is coming over.

1039
01:18:22,746 --> 01:18:24,772
What? She can't come over here!

1040
01:18:24,849 --> 01:18:27,644
- What if the guys see her?
- So?

1041
01:18:27,715 --> 01:18:29,183
One, she's a girl.

1042
01:18:29,251 --> 01:18:31,376
Two, she's not a boy.

1043
01:18:31,452 --> 01:18:33,114
And three, she smells like you.

1044
01:18:33,188 --> 01:18:36,588
This is going to be a long night.

1045
01:18:36,657 --> 01:18:37,987
For the both of us.

1046
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:39,981
- Don't start with me.
- Uh, uh.

1047
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:42,082
What's the matter with you?

1048
01:19:08,712 --> 01:19:11,510
Lindsey... get your coat on.

1049
01:19:11,582 --> 01:19:13,516
We're going to go over
and see Tommy Doyal.

1050
01:19:13,584 --> 01:19:15,346
Okay.

1051
01:19:22,823 --> 01:19:25,758
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1052
01:19:25,826 --> 01:19:28,155
Yeah, exactly.
I said get your coat on.

1053
01:19:28,226 --> 01:19:32,288
We're going over to your late-night lover
Tommy Doyal's house.

1054
01:19:32,364 --> 01:19:33,490
No, you didn't.

1055
01:19:33,565 --> 01:19:34,825
Yes, I did.

1056
01:19:34,898 --> 01:19:36,890
No, you didn't.

1057
01:19:36,968 --> 01:19:41,403
Don, I'm sorry if I don't
sound too concerned,

1058
01:19:41,470 --> 01:19:45,565
but a dead coyote and a missing headstone
doesn't prove anything.

1059
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:46,663
Well, I think you're wrong, Sheriff.

1060
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:49,436
I think it does prove
that he's here in Haddonfield.

1061
01:19:49,510 --> 01:19:52,070
It was a Halloween prank.

1062
01:19:52,146 --> 01:19:54,441
Kids pull shit like that all the time.

1063
01:19:54,512 --> 01:19:56,038
The stone will be returned tomorrow.

1064
01:19:56,115 --> 01:19:58,171
And besides, it weighs over half a ton.

1065
01:19:58,248 --> 01:20:00,717
That's my point exactly.

1066
01:20:00,784 --> 01:20:04,718
So you're saying that one man picked it up
and walked away with it?

1067
01:20:04,786 --> 01:20:05,911
Yes.

1068
01:20:05,987 --> 01:20:08,683
Doc, I may have been born,
but I wasn't born yesterday.

1069
01:20:08,756 --> 01:20:12,021
I'm sorry, Sheriff,
but please listen to me.

1070
01:20:12,092 --> 01:20:14,322
This may be a matter of life and death.

1071
01:20:14,394 --> 01:20:17,522
All right, I'll tell you what I'll do.

1072
01:20:17,597 --> 01:20:19,393
You come by my office tomorrow...

1073
01:20:19,465 --> 01:20:21,898
Tomorrow is too late.

1074
01:20:21,966 --> 01:20:24,229
Evil is here.

1075
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:26,132
It's walking amongst us.

1076
01:20:26,202 --> 01:20:29,194
Doc, it sounds to me like
you're talking about the Antichrist.

1077
01:20:29,272 --> 01:20:31,830
Well, perhaps I am.

1078
01:20:31,906 --> 01:20:32,896
Smell my feet

1079
01:20:32,974 --> 01:20:34,634
Give me something good to eat

1080
01:20:34,708 --> 01:20:36,505
If you don't, I don't care

1081
01:20:36,577 --> 01:20:38,510
I'll pull down Annie's underwear

1082
01:20:38,578 --> 01:20:41,706
I can't believe you're making me
haul this thing all the way over there.

1083
01:20:41,781 --> 01:20:45,215
I can't believe you think
I'm not going to tell.

1084
01:20:46,317 --> 01:20:49,150
Gonna share some popcorn
with your little boyfriend?

1085
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:51,085
No, I'm not.

1086
01:20:51,155 --> 01:20:52,677
You know you are.

1087
01:20:52,755 --> 01:20:55,417
You know you're going
to share something with Paul.

1088
01:20:55,491 --> 01:20:57,685
You know how annoying you are?

1089
01:20:57,759 --> 01:20:59,624
How?

1090
01:20:59,694 --> 01:21:01,752
Trick or treat, smell my feet.

1091
01:21:01,827 --> 01:21:03,557
Give me something good to eat

1092
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:06,621
- If you don't, I don't care...
- I swear to God, Lindsey.

1093
01:21:06,699 --> 01:21:08,189
If you don't stop singing that song,

1094
01:21:08,267 --> 01:21:10,098
we're going to have
a pumpkin-smashing party

1095
01:21:10,169 --> 01:21:11,896
right here in the middle of the street.

1096
01:21:20,741 --> 01:21:22,971
Tommy, where's your girlfriend Laurie?

1097
01:21:23,044 --> 01:21:25,410
Laurie's not my girlfriend.
I hate girls.

1098
01:21:25,479 --> 01:21:27,673
Why doesn't anyone understand this?

1099
01:21:27,747 --> 01:21:29,339
Good. So does Lindsey.

1100
01:21:29,416 --> 01:21:31,110
Go worship your god.

1101
01:21:31,183 --> 01:21:33,583
- Hey.
- Brought you a present.

1102
01:21:33,652 --> 01:21:35,278
Thanks.

1103
01:21:35,353 --> 01:21:38,445
You, my dear, will be happy to know

1104
01:21:38,521 --> 01:21:41,490
that I talked to Paul
about his buddy Ben Tramer.

1105
01:21:41,557 --> 01:21:44,048
Oh, I thought you said
Ben Tramer was retarded.

1106
01:21:44,126 --> 01:21:48,255
<i>Yeah, but he's not
Shortbus retarded or anything.</i>

1107
01:21:48,330 --> 01:21:49,387
What? He's okay.

1108
01:21:49,463 --> 01:21:53,091
- I mean, you need a boyfriend!
- Annie, I don't need a boyfriend.

1109
01:21:53,166 --> 01:21:54,496
- No, that's not what I meant.
- I'm fine.

1110
01:21:54,566 --> 01:21:56,159
- You need...
- Okay, Annie...

1111
01:21:56,235 --> 01:21:58,066
Oh! Oh! Yes!

1112
01:21:58,135 --> 01:21:59,160
Yes, Annie!

1113
01:21:59,238 --> 01:22:01,432
Okay, ok...

1114
01:22:01,505 --> 01:22:02,767
All right, you're right.

1115
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:04,101
I need a boyfriend.

1116
01:22:04,174 --> 01:22:05,936
So, what did he say?

1117
01:22:06,008 --> 01:22:08,942
He said, and I quote,

1118
01:22:09,010 --> 01:22:12,467
"Dude, she's fucking hot. "

1119
01:22:12,546 --> 01:22:14,447
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

1120
01:22:19,185 --> 01:22:21,347
Oh, fuck, that's Paul.
I gotta go.

1121
01:22:21,421 --> 01:22:23,250
- Have fun.
- Thanks, I will.

1122
01:22:23,321 --> 01:22:24,983
- Bye, sexy.
- Bye.

1123
01:22:30,727 --> 01:22:31,988
Hi, baby.

1124
01:22:32,060 --> 01:22:33,619
- What's up?
- How are you?

1125
01:22:33,696 --> 01:22:34,786
I'm good.
How are you?

1126
01:22:34,862 --> 01:22:36,022
Good.

1127
01:22:36,765 --> 01:22:40,723
You have to stop thinking
that we're dealing with a normal man here.

1128
01:22:40,801 --> 01:22:44,065
We're dealing with
a soulless killing machine,

1129
01:22:44,137 --> 01:22:46,763
driven by pure animal instinct.

1130
01:22:48,007 --> 01:22:51,908
Dr. Loomis, I'm going
to have to level with you.

1131
01:22:51,976 --> 01:22:53,839
I read your book.

1132
01:22:53,909 --> 01:22:56,707
I know exactly who you are,
and frankly, I don't like you.

1133
01:22:56,779 --> 01:22:58,611
And I'll tell you something else.

1134
01:22:58,682 --> 01:23:02,343
I think you have created
quite the masterpiece of a monster

1135
01:23:02,418 --> 01:23:07,819
off the blood of this town,
because monsters sell books.

1136
01:23:07,887 --> 01:23:12,288
Please, just look at this photograph
on the cover of the book.

1137
01:23:12,356 --> 01:23:13,447
All right.

1138
01:23:15,426 --> 01:23:18,861
I first met Michael 17 years ago.

1139
01:23:18,928 --> 01:23:24,488
When I first met him,
he was a sweet, charming little boy.

1140
01:23:24,564 --> 01:23:28,260
But he had nothing inside.

1141
01:23:28,334 --> 01:23:30,962
There was something missing, a void.

1142
01:23:31,037 --> 01:23:34,598
There was no conscience, no reason,

1143
01:23:34,673 --> 01:23:40,270
even a rudimentary sense
of life or death, right or wrong.

1144
01:23:40,344 --> 01:23:44,109
Yeah. He's come back for her.

1145
01:23:44,180 --> 01:23:48,549
And who is her?

1146
01:23:48,618 --> 01:23:52,178
He's come back for his baby sister.

1147
01:23:52,254 --> 01:23:55,051
I know it in my bones, Sheriff.

1148
01:23:56,623 --> 01:23:57,953
To do what?

1149
01:24:01,526 --> 01:24:03,756
I don't know, Sheriff, but...

1150
01:24:05,128 --> 01:24:07,359
it's not good.

1151
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:15,301
If I break a promise I made a long time ago,

1152
01:24:15,370 --> 01:24:18,805
then you must promise that you will play it

1153
01:24:18,872 --> 01:24:22,534
razor, and I mean razor, straight with me.

1154
01:24:25,911 --> 01:24:28,537
<i>Hello. You have reached
the Strode residence.</i>

1155
01:24:28,613 --> 01:24:31,375
<i>We can't come to the phone right now.</i>

1156
01:24:31,448 --> 01:24:35,474
<i>So please leave a message and have a...</i>

1157
01:24:35,551 --> 01:24:39,350
<i>Happy Halloweenl</i>

1158
01:24:41,589 --> 01:24:44,318
Yeah, this is Sheriff Brackett. Hello?

1159
01:24:44,391 --> 01:24:45,858
If you can hear me, pick up.

1160
01:24:45,926 --> 01:24:50,690
<i>Please, if you can hear me,
I need to talk to you immediately.</i>

1161
01:24:56,867 --> 01:24:57,855
Let's go.

1162
01:24:57,934 --> 01:25:00,869
- Laurie?
- What, Tommy?

1163
01:25:00,937 --> 01:25:05,395
I would like to return to the subject
we started earlier this evening.

1164
01:25:05,473 --> 01:25:06,997
What? Your hatred of peanut butter?

1165
01:25:07,074 --> 01:25:09,234
No, the Boogey Man.

1166
01:25:09,309 --> 01:25:11,469
I need some closure on this topic.

1167
01:25:11,543 --> 01:25:13,067
I've heard all about this.

1168
01:25:13,145 --> 01:25:15,544
What do you want to know, Tommy?

1169
01:25:15,613 --> 01:25:17,911
Why would he only attack kids
who don't believe?

1170
01:25:17,982 --> 01:25:20,108
I mean, it doesn't make sense.

1171
01:25:20,183 --> 01:25:22,776
Is it because if you believe,
then you're protected by his powers?

1172
01:25:22,852 --> 01:25:24,785
Okay, Tommy,
enough about the Boogey Man.

1173
01:25:24,853 --> 01:25:25,912
It's nonsense.

1174
01:25:25,988 --> 01:25:28,718
I'm with Tommy on this one.

1175
01:25:28,791 --> 01:25:32,783
Yeah. Why do you keep
avoiding the subject, Laurie?

1176
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:34,656
Is... Is she scared?

1177
01:25:34,727 --> 01:25:35,954
- Maybe she is.
- Ooh, yeah.

1178
01:25:36,027 --> 01:25:38,188
- Maybe you're scared!
- Are you scared?

1179
01:25:38,263 --> 01:25:39,959
Okay, stop! Stop!

1180
01:25:40,032 --> 01:25:43,556
Leave me alone for five seconds, please.

1181
01:25:43,635 --> 01:25:46,431
- Five, four, three...
- You guys...

1182
01:25:46,503 --> 01:25:48,630
- Okay, please don't.
- Two, one.

1183
01:25:48,705 --> 01:25:50,228
No! No!

1184
01:25:50,305 --> 01:25:51,932
I'm going to tell your parents!

1185
01:25:55,643 --> 01:25:58,635
Hey, don't pull it like that.
You're going to stretch it all out.

1186
01:25:58,713 --> 01:26:02,705
- Come on, munchie.
- Stop. This is expensive, idiot.

1187
01:26:12,155 --> 01:26:14,021
- You want to fuck me?
- Yeah.

1188
01:26:14,091 --> 01:26:15,818
- Yeah?
- You're so fucking hot, babe.

1189
01:26:15,891 --> 01:26:18,758
You want to fuck me?
I want to hear you say it.

1190
01:26:18,826 --> 01:26:20,315
- I'm gonna fuck you.
- Yeah?

1191
01:26:20,394 --> 01:26:21,793
Say it again.

1192
01:26:26,331 --> 01:26:28,525
It's so fucking warm.

1193
01:26:55,021 --> 01:26:56,611
Oh, my...

1194
01:26:56,687 --> 01:26:57,778
What's the matter?

1195
01:28:19,314 --> 01:28:21,075
Lindsey, it's time for you to go home.

1196
01:28:21,147 --> 01:28:22,706
But the movie's not over.

1197
01:28:22,783 --> 01:28:24,409
You can finish watching the movie
at your house.

1198
01:28:24,483 --> 01:28:27,475
- How about during the commercial break?
- Negative.

1199
01:28:27,553 --> 01:28:28,851
Go get your jacket!

1200
01:28:28,922 --> 01:28:32,184
You heard her, girl.
Keep on marching.

1201
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:34,555
Ugh! I am Queen Sheba, okay?

1202
01:28:34,626 --> 01:28:38,527
- Bow down and worship me.
- Go get your jacket.

1203
01:28:40,530 --> 01:28:42,259
Are you sure you're okay
while I take Lindsey home?

1204
01:28:42,330 --> 01:28:44,821
- I'm fine.
- Are you sure, little Tommy?

1205
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:48,391
- You'll be by yourself!
- I'm fine, now stop asking!

1206
01:28:48,469 --> 01:28:49,458
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

1207
01:28:49,537 --> 01:28:51,834
- He's scared.
- No, I'm not.

1208
01:28:51,905 --> 01:28:53,270
- Yes, you are.
- Shut up.

1209
01:28:53,339 --> 01:28:56,136
Okay, you guys. Stop.

1210
01:28:56,208 --> 01:28:59,109
Behave, Tommy-Wommy.

1211
01:29:01,511 --> 01:29:05,674
About 17 years ago,
I respond to a 911

1212
01:29:05,747 --> 01:29:08,739
which turned out to be
the Myers woman's suicide.

1213
01:29:08,816 --> 01:29:13,913
And I see this beautiful,
innocent baby sitting in this bloody mess,

1214
01:29:13,988 --> 01:29:17,148
and I can't imagine this child growing up
with a stigma around her neck,

1215
01:29:17,724 --> 01:29:23,524
so I omit her from the report,
I drive her to another town,

1216
01:29:23,594 --> 01:29:25,858
and drop her off
at the nearest emergency room.

1217
01:29:25,930 --> 01:29:27,760
And I think that this
is going to be the end of it.

1218
01:29:27,830 --> 01:29:30,696
About three months later,
I find out from a friend of mine,

1219
01:29:30,766 --> 01:29:33,826
Mason Strode,
that he's adopted the baby.

1220
01:29:33,901 --> 01:29:35,163
Oh, my God.

1221
01:29:43,641 --> 01:29:45,370
- Cold?
- Yeah.

1222
01:29:45,443 --> 01:29:46,933
Okay, come here.

1223
01:29:49,112 --> 01:29:51,240
- Did you have fun?
- Yeah.

1224
01:29:51,316 --> 01:29:53,145
You sure?

1225
01:29:53,215 --> 01:29:54,443
Yeah.

1226
01:29:57,185 --> 01:29:59,346
Annie? We're coming in.

1227
01:29:59,421 --> 01:30:01,148
You better be decent.

1228
01:30:03,724 --> 01:30:05,657
- Where are the lights?
- Here.

1229
01:30:08,726 --> 01:30:09,715
Annie!

1230
01:30:11,929 --> 01:30:13,157
Oh, my God!

1231
01:30:13,563 --> 01:30:14,656
Lindsey, run home!

1232
01:30:14,732 --> 01:30:16,631
Go call the police! Go!

1233
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:19,963
Help! Help! Help!

1234
01:30:20,034 --> 01:30:22,935
Oh, my God, honey!
Are you okay?

1235
01:30:23,004 --> 01:30:25,666
Oh, baby, what happened?

1236
01:30:27,340 --> 01:30:28,969
- He's in...
- I'm going to call the police.

1237
01:30:29,043 --> 01:30:30,838
Okay? I promise.

1238
01:30:45,654 --> 01:30:46,950
Shit!

1239
01:30:50,457 --> 01:30:54,017
<i>- 911.
- I need an ambulance, please!</i>

1240
01:30:54,093 --> 01:30:56,561
My friend's bleeding to death.

1241
01:31:22,482 --> 01:31:28,680
Laurie!

1242
01:31:28,751 --> 01:31:33,416
My name is Laurie Strode,
and I'm at 1987 Winchester Drive.

1243
01:31:33,490 --> 01:31:36,516
<i>We have a 911 call,
1987 Winchester Drive.</i>

1244
01:31:39,326 --> 01:31:40,386
This is Brackett.

1245
01:31:40,462 --> 01:31:43,121
What's the nature of the emergency
and who called it in?

1246
01:31:43,195 --> 01:31:46,220
<i>Two-stabbing-victim call
placed by a Laurie Strode.</i>

1247
01:31:46,297 --> 01:31:48,926
He's found her!
He's found her, for God's sake!

1248
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,901
- How long's it going to take to get there?
- It's about ten minutes.

1249
01:31:53,270 --> 01:31:55,204
Laurie!

1250
01:31:55,272 --> 01:31:56,704
Please, you've got to help her.

1251
01:31:56,773 --> 01:31:58,798
Laurie!

1252
01:31:58,875 --> 01:32:02,571
Baby! Baby, hold on, okay?
Annie, they're com...

1253
01:32:27,995 --> 01:32:30,623
Help!

1254
01:32:30,698 --> 01:32:32,459
Help! Please!

1255
01:32:36,703 --> 01:32:39,135
Help!

1256
01:32:39,203 --> 01:32:41,297
Help! Please!

1257
01:32:41,373 --> 01:32:44,170
Help, please! Someone!

1258
01:32:50,411 --> 01:32:52,641
Tommy!

1259
01:32:53,714 --> 01:32:56,239
Tommy, open the door!

1260
01:32:56,316 --> 01:33:00,274
Open the door!
Tommy, open the door!

1261
01:33:00,453 --> 01:33:03,785
Tommy!
Open the door!

1262
01:33:03,855 --> 01:33:08,621
Open the door! Tommy!
Open the door!

1263
01:33:08,691 --> 01:33:10,250
What's going on?

1264
01:33:10,327 --> 01:33:11,418
What's happening?

1265
01:33:11,493 --> 01:33:12,653
Where's Lindsey, Tommy?

1266
01:33:12,728 --> 01:33:13,785
- Where's Lindsey?
- She's right there!

1267
01:33:13,863 --> 01:33:15,887
- She's upstairs!
- I'm right here.

1268
01:33:20,366 --> 01:33:22,266
Go upstairs!

1269
01:33:22,335 --> 01:33:24,631
Tommy, go upstairs!

1270
01:33:32,408 --> 01:33:34,639
Guys, get in the bathroom!

1271
01:33:35,877 --> 01:33:37,742
- He's coming!
- Stop! Shh!

1272
01:33:37,812 --> 01:33:40,213
Tommy, be quiet, please?

1273
01:33:53,557 --> 01:33:55,355
I got this.
You check upstairs.

1274
01:33:55,427 --> 01:33:56,790
Right.

1275
01:34:14,406 --> 01:34:16,771
This is the police.
Are you all right?

1276
01:34:16,841 --> 01:34:19,775
He's out there! Please help us!

1277
01:34:19,843 --> 01:34:20,968
The door's locked.

1278
01:34:21,043 --> 01:34:22,671
Are you able to unlock the door?

1279
01:34:30,751 --> 01:34:32,342
Are you able to open the door?

1280
01:34:33,554 --> 01:34:34,850
Yeah.

1281
01:34:36,856 --> 01:34:38,652
Laurie, no.

1282
01:34:38,723 --> 01:34:40,054
Is he gone?

1283
01:34:40,126 --> 01:34:41,716
No, there's no one out here.

1284
01:34:47,163 --> 01:34:49,154
Please, just unlock the door.

1285
01:34:49,231 --> 01:34:50,561
Yeah, hold on.

1286
01:34:50,632 --> 01:34:54,692
- No!
- Open the door.

1287
01:35:01,273 --> 01:35:02,433
Oh, God!

1288
01:35:13,649 --> 01:35:14,742
Freeze!

1289
01:35:18,954 --> 01:35:20,579
Aah!

1290
01:36:28,469 --> 01:36:30,098
Stay behind me.

1291
01:36:44,916 --> 01:36:46,780
Annie?

1292
01:36:46,850 --> 01:36:48,283
Sweetie?

1293
01:36:49,086 --> 01:36:50,882
Annie.

1294
01:36:50,952 --> 01:36:52,978
Annie. Oh, sweetie.

1295
01:36:53,055 --> 01:36:55,955
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

1296
01:36:56,024 --> 01:36:58,082
They'll be here soon.
Come on, darling.

1297
01:36:59,361 --> 01:37:00,349
Jesus.

1298
01:37:00,427 --> 01:37:02,290
Over here!

1299
01:37:03,529 --> 01:37:04,518
Inside here!

1300
01:37:04,597 --> 01:37:06,290
- Boogey Man!
- Help!

1301
01:37:09,133 --> 01:37:10,192
Guys, over here!

1302
01:37:10,269 --> 01:37:11,860
- The Boogey Man!
- What is it?

1303
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:13,697
Help! The Boogey Man!

1304
01:37:13,769 --> 01:37:14,759
- What? What?
- He's over there!

1305
01:37:14,838 --> 01:37:17,396
He took Laurie.
He took Laurie away.

1306
01:37:17,472 --> 01:37:18,565
Okay, guys.

1307
01:37:18,641 --> 01:37:21,073
Go over and stand by that ambulance
and just wait there.

1308
01:37:21,141 --> 01:37:22,609
Don't move!

1309
01:37:51,898 --> 01:37:54,229
Lynda?

1310
01:37:56,868 --> 01:37:58,664
Lynda?

1311
01:38:05,374 --> 01:38:07,740
Lynda, wake up!

1312
01:38:07,810 --> 01:38:10,038
Lynda, wake up, please!

1313
01:38:10,110 --> 01:38:11,737
Lynda, wake up!

1314
01:38:15,082 --> 01:38:17,446
Lynda, please wake up!

1315
01:38:21,385 --> 01:38:25,413
Lynda, please!
Please, please, please wake up!

1316
01:38:27,791 --> 01:38:28,952
He's going to come soon.

1317
01:38:29,026 --> 01:38:31,822
Lynda, wake up, please!

1318
01:38:40,132 --> 01:38:42,430
Who are you?

1319
01:38:42,501 --> 01:38:43,694
What do you want?

1320
01:38:48,740 --> 01:38:51,263
No, no, please.

1321
01:38:51,341 --> 01:38:54,138
Please don't hurt us, please!

1322
01:38:54,209 --> 01:38:57,007
No, please don't hurt me, please!

1323
01:39:27,834 --> 01:39:29,201
I don't understand.

1324
01:39:29,270 --> 01:39:33,602
Please, just let...
Please leave me alone!

1325
01:39:33,673 --> 01:39:36,733
I don't know them! Please!

1326
01:40:19,272 --> 01:40:22,173
I want to help you.

1327
01:40:22,242 --> 01:40:25,003
I just don't understand.

1328
01:40:25,075 --> 01:40:27,942
I want to help you.

1329
01:40:28,011 --> 01:40:31,537
I just don't know how.

1330
01:40:31,614 --> 01:40:34,640
I want to help you.

1331
01:40:34,717 --> 01:40:36,617
I don't...

1332
01:40:36,685 --> 01:40:38,379
You motherfucker!

1333
01:40:44,457 --> 01:40:46,947
Someone help me!

1334
01:40:47,927 --> 01:40:50,485
Shit. Let me out!

1335
01:40:50,561 --> 01:40:52,290

01:40:52,363 --> 01:40:54,227
Let me out!

1337
01:41:17,447 --> 01:41:20,042
Somebody, please help me!

1338
01:41:24,985 --> 01:41:27,454
Please!
Somebody, please!

1339
01:41:55,343 --> 01:41:57,104
Get off! Help me!

1340
01:42:36,974 --> 01:42:38,837
Please, please.

1341
01:42:43,144 --> 01:42:44,771
Please.

1342
01:42:44,845 --> 01:42:49,371
Help! Somebody, please!

1343
01:42:49,448 --> 01:42:52,281
No, please, please.

1344
01:42:52,351 --> 01:42:54,977
Help! Somebody, please!

1345
01:42:55,051 --> 01:42:58,384
Help! Help!

1346
01:42:58,455 --> 01:43:00,752
Somebody, please!

1347
01:43:04,059 --> 01:43:07,357
Please. Please.

1348
01:43:10,698 --> 01:43:12,663
No. No. No.

1349
01:43:13,365 --> 01:43:14,993
Shit.

1350
01:43:18,137 --> 01:43:20,967
Please! Somebody!

1351
01:43:31,645 --> 01:43:34,137
Michael! Stop!

1352
01:43:36,348 --> 01:43:39,145
Michael, it's me... Samuel.

1353
01:43:42,420 --> 01:43:44,945
Michael, please stop!

1354
01:43:45,023 --> 01:43:47,856
Help! Please!

1355
01:43:47,926 --> 01:43:50,153
Please! Stop!

1356
01:43:52,228 --> 01:43:54,694
Stop! Michael!

1357
01:43:56,431 --> 01:43:57,691
Shit.

1358
01:43:57,764 --> 01:43:59,393
Help!

1359
01:43:59,467 --> 01:44:00,864
Stop!

1360
01:44:08,639 --> 01:44:10,104
Please.

1361
01:44:15,978 --> 01:44:17,739
Help me, please.

1362
01:44:21,883 --> 01:44:24,315
It's all right. It's all right.

1363
01:44:24,383 --> 01:44:27,943
You're safe now. It's okay.

1364
01:44:28,019 --> 01:44:29,783
Ow, my leg.

1365
01:44:30,789 --> 01:44:32,379
It's okay.

1366
01:44:32,455 --> 01:44:33,890
It's all right.

1367
01:45:45,744 --> 01:45:49,110
Was that the Boogey Man?

1368
01:45:51,446 --> 01:45:56,383
As a matter of fact, I do believe it was.

1369
01:46:00,687 --> 01:46:02,813
Jesus Christ! What the hell?

1370
01:46:04,124 --> 01:46:06,352
Michael, don't!

1371
01:46:09,527 --> 01:46:11,290
Michael, stop!

1372
01:46:14,665 --> 01:46:17,689
For God's sake, listen to me!

1373
01:46:17,766 --> 01:46:20,997
Look... it's not her fault.

1374
01:46:23,604 --> 01:46:25,161
Michael, it's my fault.

1375
01:46:25,238 --> 01:46:27,604
I failed you.

1376
01:46:27,675 --> 01:46:30,370
Please, let her go. Please.

1377
01:46:59,664 --> 01:47:00,823
Open!
