1
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,956
This is the Earth at a time
when the dinosaurs roamed...

2
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:36,516
a lush and fertile planet.

3
00:00:44,084 --> 00:00:49,398
A piece of rock just six miles wide
changed all that.

4
00:00:57,208 --> 00:01:00,919
lt hit with the force
of 10,000 nuclear weapons.

5
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:08,129
A trillion tons of dirt and rock
hurtled into the atmosphere...

6
00:01:08,252 --> 00:01:11,005
creating a suffocating
blanket of dust...

7
00:01:11,132 --> 00:01:13,442
the sun was powerless
to penetrate...

8
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,803
for a thousand years.

9
00:01:23,776 --> 00:01:25,574
lt happened before.

10
00:01:26,817 --> 00:01:28,615
lt will happen again.

11
00:01:30,338 --> 00:01:33,251
lt's just a question of when.

12
00:01:48,183 --> 00:01:50,653
Engineering director-- Engineering--

13
00:01:51,865 --> 00:01:54,823
- Say again, Rudy.
- Houston, affirmative.

14
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:57,782
l'm gonna try again.

15
00:01:57,907 --> 00:02:01,422
This time why don't we put in a hold
at nine. Cancel the pending resume.

16
00:02:01,507 --> 00:02:04,068
Almost got it.

17
00:02:05,788 --> 00:02:09,465
- Dennis, l'm almost there.
- Houston, Pete's looking real strong.

18
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,867
Okay, Pete. We got that coupling
on the board here now.

19
00:02:12,951 --> 00:02:16,069
We'll give you the go-ahead
from down here when it's in alignment.

20
00:02:16,152 --> 00:02:18,826
Sounds good.
Give me ten seconds.

21
00:02:20,993 --> 00:02:22,825
His heart rate's racing.

22
00:02:22,914 --> 00:02:24,871
- Hey, Pete. lt's Truman.
- Hey.

23
00:02:24,955 --> 00:02:26,946
- How you doing up there, Hoss?
- Pretty good.

24
00:02:27,035 --> 00:02:29,504
Now, listen, Pete.
We got an eye on your meds here.

25
00:02:29,596 --> 00:02:32,350
l'll give you a buffalo nickel
if you'll calm down just a little bit.

26
00:02:32,477 --> 00:02:35,151
- Can you do that for me?
- Whatever you say.

27
00:02:35,278 --> 00:02:38,668
Okay, uh, now we got plenty of time,
buddy, so don't you worry.

28
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,877
- Atlantis--
- Okay. Looking good here.

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,878
- He's got it.
- He'll be all right.
- Go ahead, Atlantis.

30
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:49,755
Roger that, Houston.
Suggest we start reeling Pete in.

31
00:03:00,285 --> 00:03:02,162
- The system's down.
- No.

32
00:03:02,285 --> 00:03:04,164
- What the hell is that?
- My Lord.

33
00:03:10,368 --> 00:03:12,837
We're down.

34
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,723
Houston!

35
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,486
- We've lost all contact.
- What happened?

36
00:03:22,492 --> 00:03:25,053
Stewart, play that tape back!

37
00:03:29,894 --> 00:03:32,614
Houston!

38
00:03:33,535 --> 00:03:35,207
Multiple bogeys! Multiple bogeys!

39
00:03:35,295 --> 00:03:39,131
Sector five, niner. l have three.
Now five. Unidentified tracts.

40
00:03:39,257 --> 00:03:42,056
- My screen's full.
- Multiple tracts headed towards
the Atlantic seaboard.

41
00:03:42,178 --> 00:03:45,329
This could be
a surprise missile attack.

42
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,412
Mr President, the shuttle Atlantis
just exploded in space.

43
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,339
Okay, l want three groups!

44
00:03:54,462 --> 00:03:56,657
One: internal malfunction.

45
00:03:56,742 --> 00:03:59,211
Get the log tape. Start working back.
Maybe it's a glitch.

46
00:03:59,303 --> 00:04:04,504
Two: l want NORAD Space Command and the
50th Tactical comparing all the space
junk you track in every orbit.

47
00:04:04,585 --> 00:04:06,655
l want you to check, recheck
and then do it all over again.

48
00:04:06,785 --> 00:04:09,619
Number three: wild cards,
anything and everything.

49
00:04:09,746 --> 00:04:11,703
All right? Now, big Ross,
l want you to get on the telephone.

50
00:04:11,787 --> 00:04:14,381
- Wake up 11,000 people.
- Right.
- Walt, get 'em going.

51
00:04:14,467 --> 00:04:16,345
- Let's go!
- Karl!

52
00:04:16,428 --> 00:04:19,466
Karl! Karl!

53
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:26,511
Karl! Your Stouffer's pot pie's
been on the table almost ten hours.

54
00:04:26,631 --> 00:04:28,987
- l want a divorce.
- Dottie, l'm on to something big here.

55
00:04:29,112 --> 00:04:32,185
l-l don't know what this is, but it
looks like something's burning up there.

56
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:36,102
Go get my phone book, will you?
Get my phone book. Get those names
of those guys from NASA.

57
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:40,786
Excuse me! Am l wearing a sign
that says, ''Karl's slave''?

58
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:45,393
Go get my goddam phone book!
Get the book!

59
00:04:45,517 --> 00:04:47,235
Get the book!
Get the book!

60
00:04:51,638 --> 00:04:55,349
Space Command is reporting negative.
That is zero global launches.

61
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,591
- lt might just be pieces of
the shuttle breaking up as it comes in.
- Yeah, it might be Santa Claus.

62
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,839
Until we get definitive, reliable
alternative confirmation, General...

63
00:05:01,962 --> 00:05:03,873
we go to defcon three.

64
00:05:08,924 --> 00:05:12,474
l'm getting ready for the big time

65
00:05:12,565 --> 00:05:16,924
Someday you're gonna say
l'm big time too

66
00:05:17,047 --> 00:05:18,446
Hey, little man! Little Richard!

67
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:22,840
Me and you, man!
We going to the top, baby! Big time!

68
00:05:22,968 --> 00:05:25,403
Yo, man, l ain't gonna be ridin'
this bike the rest of my life!

69
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:29,239
You know what l'm sayin'?
l'm gettin' a motorcycle, baby.
We gonna travel in style.

70
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,522
l'm getting ready for the big time

71
00:05:34,652 --> 00:05:37,007
Someday you're gonna say
l'm big time

72
00:05:37,132 --> 00:05:40,808
Watch where you're goin'. l bet you,
none of y'all stop for brothers.

73
00:05:40,893 --> 00:05:45,013
Slow down, Little Richard.
You've been ridin' all morning, man.
You gotta take a dump?

74
00:05:47,215 --> 00:05:51,256
- We interrupt our regularly
scheduled programme to bring you
this special report.
- Hey, man, what happened?

75
00:05:51,337 --> 00:05:56,537
The shuttle Atlantis exploded in space
at 3:47 a.m., Eastern Standard Time.

76
00:05:56,658 --> 00:05:59,253
This morning
NASA officials are denying--

77
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:01,496
Hey! Hey, get! Get!

78
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,220
- That's my Godzilla. Come on, now.
- Yo, fool!

79
00:06:07,302 --> 00:06:11,216
-Don't be kickin' Little Richard.
What the hell your problem?
-Now that dog's eating my Godzilla, man.

80
00:06:11,303 --> 00:06:13,942
- And what's a little runt like you
gonna do about it?
- Get him, Richard. Sic him.

81
00:06:14,023 --> 00:06:18,462
lf l wasn't a Christian,
l'd be throwin' your fat,
pineapple-eatin' ass through the window.

82
00:06:30,588 --> 00:06:33,263
- Why we not going, huh?
- Well, y-y-you know why?
'Cause this is New York City.

83
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,621
Anything could have happened.
Look at that. Uh, let's see.
lt could have been a terrorist bomb.

84
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,028
lt could have been
a dead body somebody shot, stabbed.
And it's Friday. Payday too.

85
00:06:40,112 --> 00:06:43,343
- Somebody probably jumped,
didn't get their pay cheque. Yes.
- l want to go shopping.

86
00:06:43,472 --> 00:06:48,389
Me too, but we ain't goin' nowhere
'cause this is a traffic jam.

87
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:50,750
- Little Richard.
- Hurry! Right over there!
- Go!

88
00:06:50,835 --> 00:06:52,871
Yo, Little Richard!

89
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:54,786
Hang on, Little Richard!
l'm comin'!

90
00:06:56,436 --> 00:06:59,076
Don't you worry about it.
l'm gonna get you outta there!

91
00:06:59,157 --> 00:07:02,628
You okay, buddy?
Don't worry about it. Hang in there.

92
00:07:02,758 --> 00:07:05,034
Somebody dial 911!

93
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:07,037
My screen's full!
They're all over the place!

94
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,470
Bogeys are breachin'
the atmosphere from Finland down
the North American seaboard.

95
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,517
Whoa!

96
00:07:25,565 --> 00:07:27,317
Look at that!

97
00:07:32,887 --> 00:07:35,322
Oh, we at war!

98
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,644
Saddam Hussein is bombin' us!

99
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,694
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

100
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,809
Get out of here!

101
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,977
Oh, my God!

102
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:33,701
Let's stay focused.
We need to map the trajectory now.

103
00:08:33,785 --> 00:08:35,378
- That could take a week.
- Just find it, okay?

104
00:08:35,506 --> 00:08:38,863
- l want to know if the worst is over
or if it's on its way.
- We've got General Kimsey on the line.

105
00:08:38,987 --> 00:08:43,425
We've got hits from Finland to South
Carolina. We know they're not missiles.
Now what the hell is it?

106
00:08:43,508 --> 00:08:46,786
lt's a meteor shower.
That's what took out the shuttle.

107
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,464
- He's waiting for you.
- What's the death toll?

108
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,946
l've got the President
on Air Force One demanding answers.

109
00:08:52,871 --> 00:08:54,351
ls it over?

110
00:08:54,472 --> 00:08:58,864
General, we've got 11,000 people at NASA
trying to figure that out right now.
When we know, you'll know.

111
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:07,709
Okay, Karl, listen.
l want you to take your time.
Yes, sir. You are definitely the first.

112
00:09:07,835 --> 00:09:12,706
Okay, first coordinate.
One-two-three-nine. 1239, right?

113
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:16,755
- FBl locked his location.
- Saw an explosion in space.

114
00:09:16,838 --> 00:09:19,354
- Okay.
- The last one--

115
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,314
- Now, listen, Karl, this is top secret.
- Sir, l'm retired Navy.
l know all about classified.

116
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,758
But one more thing. The person
that finds her gets to name her, right?

117
00:09:26,882 --> 00:09:30,922
- Yes, that's right. That's right.
- l want to name her Dottie,
after my wife.

118
00:09:31,043 --> 00:09:35,994
- She's a vicious, life-suckin' bitch
from which there's no escape.
- That's-- That's sweet, Karl.

119
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:39,242
S.D.l., this is Flight Director.
l want to get that Hubble movin',
and l want it now.

120
00:09:39,365 --> 00:09:42,039
Roger that.
We're movin' the Hubble!

121
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:53,518
- lt's enormous.
- This is the anomaly at 1643.

122
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,844
Here is the anomaly at 1658.

123
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:02,288
And here is the anomaly at 1700.

124
00:10:02,412 --> 00:10:04,768
Enough with this
''anomaly'' horseshit!

125
00:10:04,853 --> 00:10:08,130
- What is this thing?
- lt's an asteroid, sir.

126
00:10:08,214 --> 00:10:10,968
How big are we talking?

127
00:10:11,055 --> 00:10:12,932
Sir, our best estimate
is 97.6 billion--

128
00:10:13,015 --> 00:10:15,735
- lt's the size of Texas, Mr President.
- Y-Y-Yes, sir.

129
00:10:15,856 --> 00:10:18,052
Dan, we didn't
see this thing coming?

130
00:10:18,177 --> 00:10:20,373
Well, our object collision
budget's a million dollars.

131
00:10:20,498 --> 00:10:22,534
That allows us to track
about three percent of the sky.

132
00:10:22,618 --> 00:10:25,817
- And begging your pardon, sir,
but it's a big-ass sky.
- And the ones this morning?

133
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,295
Uh, those are nothing.
Uh, they're the size of basketballs...

134
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,211
and, uh, Volkswagens,
things like that.

135
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,902
ls this going to hit us?

136
00:10:32,982 --> 00:10:36,657
- We're efforting that as we speak, sir.
- What kind of damage are we--

137
00:10:36,783 --> 00:10:38,455
Damage?

138
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,539
Total, sir.

139
00:10:40,663 --> 00:10:43,099
lt's what we call a global killer.

140
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,181
The end of mankind.

141
00:10:45,305 --> 00:10:47,182
Doesn't matter where it hits.

142
00:10:47,305 --> 00:10:49,502
Nothing would survive,
not even bacteria.

143
00:10:49,627 --> 00:10:53,507
My God. What do we do?

144
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:05,023
We have 18 days
before it hits Earth.

145
00:11:15,154 --> 00:11:17,908
- Have mercy.
- Rise and shine!

146
00:11:19,955 --> 00:11:22,869
Stop the drilling!
Stop the drilling! Stop the drilling!

147
00:11:22,957 --> 00:11:25,425
- Fore!
- Stop the drilling!

148
00:11:25,557 --> 00:11:27,355
Stop the drilling!
Stop the drilling!

149
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:30,236
- Hey!
- Hey, that was close!

150
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,237
l gave you 50,000 a year in donations!
What do you think they're
so mad about, Chick?

151
00:11:38,361 --> 00:11:41,115
Well, l think they feel that
drilling for oil is an evil thing.

152
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,996
Do you know how much diesel
that clunker boat pumps out in an hour?

153
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,358
You know, l just found out
something interesting.

154
00:11:46,483 --> 00:11:50,478
- Number two chewed 180 feet last night.
- Who do we have to thank for this?

155
00:11:50,605 --> 00:11:53,278
Well, l'll give you two guesses,
but you're only gonna need one.

156
00:11:53,405 --> 00:11:55,442
Goddam it, A.J.!

157
00:11:55,566 --> 00:11:57,478
A.J.!

158
00:11:59,807 --> 00:12:02,800
A.J.!
A.J., you in here?

159
00:12:02,928 --> 00:12:05,284
Oh, that's just perfect.
ln bed. Get up!

160
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:09,289
- Uh, hey, you wanted to see me?
- Yeah, l was lookin' for ya.

161
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,168
You're pissed.
Okay, l can see that.

162
00:12:11,251 --> 00:12:15,803
No. You know what, A.J.?
l'm not pissed. You've seen me pissed.
This is way, way beyond pissed, though.

163
00:12:15,892 --> 00:12:19,408
- You know l shut down number two
last night, right?
- Yeah, man, l had a hunch on that.

164
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:23,130
Dude, let me tell you somethin'.
Someday, many years from now,
when you're all growed up...

165
00:12:23,255 --> 00:12:27,453
and you got your own
oil company and $8 million
of your own money on the contract...

166
00:12:27,576 --> 00:12:31,013
you can do whatever comes
into that little A.J.-idiotin' mind
of yours you want...

167
00:12:31,097 --> 00:12:34,534
but as long as it says
''Harry Stamper Oil'' on the rig
you will not disobey my rules.

168
00:12:34,618 --> 00:12:36,574
- You got that?
- Yeah, l do got it.

169
00:12:36,698 --> 00:12:39,817
- Right now, l need to hear
five words from you.
- Uh--

170
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,898
- l'll never do that again.
- Never do that again.

171
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,290
l'm a fool. That was idiotic.
l-l mean, that was stupid.

172
00:12:45,421 --> 00:12:47,378
l'm an idiot. l know what name's
on the sign. l'm not-- l can't--

173
00:12:47,502 --> 00:12:49,937
- What's going on here?
- What's going on? Well, l-l mean, l--

174
00:12:50,023 --> 00:12:53,777
- l screwed up. l'm a little edgy.
- How long you worked for me?
- Five wonderful years.

175
00:12:53,864 --> 00:12:56,777
ln five years, you have never
apologized to me this quickly.

176
00:12:56,865 --> 00:13:00,255
- Something's going on here.
l'm gonna find out what it is.
- No, no, no. Well--

177
00:13:00,385 --> 00:13:04,824
l-l'm turning over a new leaf.
l'm trying to learn from the man.
What would Harry do?

178
00:13:09,988 --> 00:13:12,140
l'm at a loss for words.

179
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,829
- Okay, l can explain this.
- You can explain that?

180
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,746
- l can.
- l would really like an explanation.
You just stay right here.

181
00:13:25,033 --> 00:13:28,584
- Grace?
- Hi, Harry.

182
00:13:28,715 --> 00:13:31,309
l have asked you repeatedly
to call me Dad.

183
00:13:32,155 --> 00:13:34,909
- Sorry, Harry.
- Get up and get your clothes on.

184
00:13:38,437 --> 00:13:40,998
You just stay right there.
l'll be right back.

185
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:52,199
Here's what we're gonna do.
l want every strategy we've got
on near-Earth object collision, okay?

186
00:13:52,322 --> 00:13:56,874
Any ideas, any programs,
anything you sketched
on a pizza box or a cocktail napkin.

187
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:01,043
For 30 years, they questioned
the need for NASA. Today
we're gonna give them the answer.

188
00:14:04,045 --> 00:14:06,479
You know about this, Rockhound?
You knew.

189
00:14:06,605 --> 00:14:08,517
No, l-l had no idea.

190
00:14:10,007 --> 00:14:12,521
Where's Harry?

191
00:14:12,647 --> 00:14:15,242
Harry! All right! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
l understand, okay?

192
00:14:15,368 --> 00:14:17,758
You're mad.
Who-Who wouldn't be mad?

193
00:14:17,849 --> 00:14:20,410
- But he's gonna shoot you.
- Nah. No, he's not. Oh, shit.

194
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:26,730
- Harry!
- What's wrong with you?

195
00:14:26,812 --> 00:14:28,848
Make your peace with God, A.J.

196
00:14:28,932 --> 00:14:32,687
- This guy's got a gun, man!
He's shooting at me!
- Harry, this is not funny!

197
00:14:32,773 --> 00:14:36,927
- Harry, listen to me!
We can talk this over!
- So is this a, uh, serious thing?

198
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,250
- Yeah, pretty serious.
- Bear, man!
- What's up?

199
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,937
He's shooting at me. Uh, you see Harry
comin', crack him with that wrench!

200
00:14:42,017 --> 00:14:45,089
You told A.J.'s dad just before he died
that you would take care of the boy.

201
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,174
Now, l'm not sure that shootin' him
is takin' care of him.

202
00:14:47,298 --> 00:14:50,336
- Why don't you put the gun down, boss?
- You don't want none of this, Bear.
Get out of my way.

203
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:52,371
Just trying to give my man
a head start, that's all.

204
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,533
Not to mention the fact that l
don't think you wanna kill the best man
on your crew before we strike oil.

205
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,535
Ah, Chick, l ain't gonna kill him.
Just gonna take a foot off.
A man can work with one foot.

206
00:15:00,622 --> 00:15:03,501
You remember old Frank Marx
who worked with one hand all them years?

207
00:15:03,623 --> 00:15:07,458
- Yeah, but he wasn't very good.
- Harry, put the gun down!
You're acting insane!

208
00:15:07,584 --> 00:15:09,860
Now honey, go get some clothes on
and get out of the way.

209
00:15:09,985 --> 00:15:13,865
- You can't control my life.
- Fine. Clothes. Now!

210
00:15:13,986 --> 00:15:17,184
All right, stop, all right? lt was funny
for a minute, it's not funny any more.

211
00:15:20,308 --> 00:15:24,063
- Harry, this is illegal, man.
- l'm temporarily insane, Rock.
lt's all right.

212
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,549
- Do l look like l'm crazy to you?
- Well--

213
00:15:30,671 --> 00:15:32,708
Harry, hey, just cool down.

214
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:35,750
- What are you-- Okay, stop.
- All right. All right, Harry.

215
00:15:35,873 --> 00:15:37,989
All right. Now, listen, man to man.

216
00:15:38,073 --> 00:15:40,793
l'm serious. l love her.

217
00:15:40,914 --> 00:15:42,667
Way wrong answer.

218
00:15:45,435 --> 00:15:48,075
- Whoa, whoa, Harry. lt's gettin' real.
- Harry! Come on, Harry!

219
00:15:48,196 --> 00:15:50,791
- Stop him!
- You shot him!

220
00:15:50,877 --> 00:15:52,550
Bullet never got close.
Just a ricochet.

221
00:15:52,678 --> 00:15:55,033
You know, it's all funny
till somebody gets shot in the leg.

222
00:15:55,158 --> 00:15:58,709
Hey, pucker up!
We got clients incoming!

223
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,112
Uh, b-back in, uh, 1974...

224
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,552
w-we first got the-the idea,
the possibility that a, that a meteor
or an asteroid--

225
00:16:06,682 --> 00:16:10,312
l need somebody who's had a little less
caffeine this morning. Doc, translate.

226
00:16:10,443 --> 00:16:13,993
Our first feasibility plan was to use
a spread-focus laser generator...

227
00:16:14,124 --> 00:16:15,956
to heat the object
to the point of fracture.

228
00:16:16,085 --> 00:16:18,235
That's like shooting a B.B. gun
at a freight train, Doc.

229
00:16:18,365 --> 00:16:20,163
Uh, some of us have got this idea.

230
00:16:20,286 --> 00:16:23,643
We want to land a craft,
deploy solar sails.

231
00:16:23,767 --> 00:16:26,566
You'll have a great big canopy.
Solar winds will be caught...

232
00:16:26,688 --> 00:16:29,886
by these mylar sails.

233
00:16:30,009 --> 00:16:31,921
- Okay.
- Come on, guys.

234
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:35,599
We gotta come up with something
realistic here. We got 18 days.

235
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:39,207
That's 431 hours,
15 minutes and 18 seconds.

236
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,846
Time's a luxury we don't have.
What?

237
00:16:44,773 --> 00:16:48,131
Listen, Harry. A.J. is my choice--
my choice and not yours.

238
00:16:48,255 --> 00:16:51,930
He's the only one in your age bracket,
Grace. lt's not a choice,
it's a lack of options.

239
00:16:52,015 --> 00:16:56,727
l don't know what in the world makes
you think that you have the right
to tell me what to do any more, Harry.

240
00:16:56,857 --> 00:16:58,974
l suppose being your father
doesn't count, huh?

241
00:16:59,058 --> 00:17:00,969
- Not really.
- Since when?

242
00:17:01,098 --> 00:17:04,057
Since l reached the age of 10
and became older than you, Harry.

243
00:17:04,139 --> 00:17:05,858
Since Mom split.
Why don't you take your pick?

244
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:11,534
Look, l understand that you are
handicapped by a natural immaturity
and l forgive you.

245
00:17:11,662 --> 00:17:14,256
l may be an immature father, okay?
But l'm still your employer.

246
00:17:14,382 --> 00:17:17,420
And as your boss l want you
on that crew boat tonight
and back in the office by Monday.

247
00:17:17,543 --> 00:17:20,502
- You got that?
- Okay. l quit.

248
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:24,618
Grace, you can't quit now.
l need you to keep on workin'.

249
00:17:26,786 --> 00:17:31,497
- Hi, Harry!
- What are you smilin' about?

250
00:17:32,908 --> 00:17:36,458
l've been seein' A.J.
for more than five months, Harry.

251
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,864
You little hypocrite. l ever held you
back once from doin' anything?

252
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,704
What about having a life, Harry?
The first time l got my period...

253
00:17:43,831 --> 00:17:45,948
Rockhound had to take me
into Taipei for Tampax...

254
00:17:46,072 --> 00:17:48,142
and then he had to show me
how to use 'em, Harry.

255
00:17:50,753 --> 00:17:54,224
l ju-- No, l-l told her how to use it.
l didn't show her, Harry.

256
00:17:55,595 --> 00:17:58,985
l was playing
with titanium depth gauges when
l should've been playing with dolls.

257
00:17:59,115 --> 00:18:03,076
l mean, l learned about the birds and
the bees from Freddie Noonan's tattoos.

258
00:18:03,197 --> 00:18:05,871
Look, l was raised
on roughnecks by you...

259
00:18:05,998 --> 00:18:08,432
and now you get all shocked and shaken
when l fall in love with one.

260
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:11,870
- So who is the hypocrite here,
Harry, huh? Who?
- Look at those nice pipes up there.

261
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,959
- Listen to me, Grace. l want you--
- No, you listen to me, Harry.
l grew up.

262
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,676
With the proximity of the asteroid...

263
00:18:18,762 --> 00:18:21,356
and no prep time,
none of our primary plans can work.

264
00:18:21,442 --> 00:18:25,595
Why don't we just send up 150 nuclear
warheads and blast that rock apart?

265
00:18:25,723 --> 00:18:29,001
- Terrible idea.
- Was l talkin' to you?

266
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:33,995
This is Dr Ronald Quincy from research,
pretty much the smartest man on the
planet. You might want to listen to him.

267
00:18:34,086 --> 00:18:38,718
General, if you consider your target--
her composition, her dimensions...

268
00:18:38,848 --> 00:18:41,885
her sheer velocity, you could fire
every nuke you've got at her...

269
00:18:41,968 --> 00:18:45,007
and she'll just smile at you
and keep on coming.

270
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,325
You should know that the president's
scientific advisors...

271
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:51,843
are suggesting that a nuclear blast
could change this asteroid's trajectory.

272
00:18:51,972 --> 00:18:55,488
l know the president's chief scientific
advisor. We were at M.l.T. together.

273
00:18:55,613 --> 00:18:58,525
And in a situation like this, you--
you really don't want...

274
00:18:58,613 --> 00:19:02,733
to take the advice of a man
who got a C-minus in astrophysics.

275
00:19:02,855 --> 00:19:07,691
The president's advisors are,
um, wrong. l'm right.

276
00:19:07,817 --> 00:19:09,808
Hitting the rock from the outside
won't do the job.

277
00:19:09,937 --> 00:19:13,214
lmagine a firecracker
in the palm of your hand.

278
00:19:13,298 --> 00:19:16,974
You set it off.
What happens? Burn your hand, right?

279
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:20,570
You close your fist around
the same firecracker and set it off--

280
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,062
Your wife's gonna be opening your
ketchup bottles the rest of your life.

281
00:19:25,142 --> 00:19:27,178
Are you suggesting
we blow this thing up from the inside?

282
00:19:27,262 --> 00:19:29,982
- That's exactly what l'm saying.
- How?

283
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:33,733
We drill. We bring in the world's
best deep-core driller.

284
00:19:33,824 --> 00:19:36,214
Harry, get up here!
We're takin' a hit!

285
00:19:36,345 --> 00:19:38,256
- Get A.J. up here! Whoa!
- Come on!

286
00:19:40,226 --> 00:19:42,377
Send another pipe on down!
Right now! Full pipe!

287
00:19:43,867 --> 00:19:47,577
- lt's a gas pocket.
- l told you. Am l lucky
or am l just a genius?

288
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,587
l shut it down for a reason, you
jackass! The relief valve's fried open.

289
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:57,624
Shut off the number two valve!
Grace, get the clients outta here now!

290
00:20:03,753 --> 00:20:06,222
Chick, get 'em outta here!
Get 'em off the rig now!

291
00:20:11,595 --> 00:20:14,634
Get the hell down!
This thing is gonna blow!

292
00:20:21,878 --> 00:20:24,838
Get out! Chick, get out now!

293
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,157
Get down!

294
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,200
Three dozen research calls and every
time the same man is recommended.

295
00:20:31,322 --> 00:20:33,438
He's worked on every terrain
this planet can offer.

296
00:20:33,562 --> 00:20:35,599
Whenever they said it couldn't be
drilled, this guy drilled it.

297
00:20:35,723 --> 00:20:39,273
- Everybody all right?
- We struck oil, baby!

298
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,715
Somebody could've got killed out here
today. You want that on your conscience?

299
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:47,163
High thumb. You are man, Harry.

300
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,841
Thumbs high.

301
00:20:52,528 --> 00:20:54,405
You're fired.

302
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,039
Who's Harry Stamper?

303
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:03,639
Yeah, l'm Harry Stamper.
What's all this about?

304
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:07,247
Mr Stamper, l'm General Montgomery,
commander of the Pacific air forces.

305
00:21:07,372 --> 00:21:09,489
l've been sent here
by the secretary of defence...

306
00:21:09,613 --> 00:21:12,845
on direct orders from the president
of the United States.

307
00:21:12,974 --> 00:21:15,205
lt's a matter of urgent
national security.

308
00:21:15,335 --> 00:21:18,691
l need you to get on that chopper
right now, no questions asked.

309
00:21:18,775 --> 00:21:21,894
- Crazy Willie put you up to this?
- Afraid l don't know Crazy Willie.

310
00:21:21,977 --> 00:21:24,970
Sir, l'm dead serious about this.

311
00:21:26,338 --> 00:21:28,010
- Harry.
- What?

312
00:21:28,098 --> 00:21:30,294
Man, l swear to God,
she never told me her age.

313
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,139
lt's all right.
Relax. lt's about me.

314
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,251
Oh. Forget it.

315
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,658
All right, General.
l'll go with ya.

316
00:21:42,783 --> 00:21:45,856
On one condition--
we have to take my daughter along.

317
00:21:48,905 --> 00:21:50,816
- What did l do?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where you guys
takin' her? Wait a minute.

318
00:21:50,945 --> 00:21:53,301
- Sir, stay right here.
- Well--

319
00:21:53,426 --> 00:21:55,736
Chick! Get him paid,
get him off the rig!

320
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,708
- Mr Stamper?
- Yeah, l'm Harry Stamper.

321
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:12,507
How ya doin'? Miss Stamper.
l'm Dan Truman, executive director here.

322
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:15,067
- Now listen, on behalf of all of us,
l'd really like to apologize--
- Apologize.

323
00:22:15,193 --> 00:22:17,343
l don't know if we can take
any more apologies, Mr Truman.

324
00:22:17,473 --> 00:22:20,273
We've been apologized to
for the last 18 and a half hours.

325
00:22:20,395 --> 00:22:22,590
So if you don't mind,
how 'bout if we just get on with it...

326
00:22:22,715 --> 00:22:25,309
and you tell us why we're here
at the NASA space centre?

327
00:22:25,395 --> 00:22:29,868
- We should probably talk alone.
- Mr Truman, l don't keep any secrets
from my daughter, Grace.

328
00:22:29,997 --> 00:22:32,432
So whether you tell her now or
l tell her later she's gonna find out...

329
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:34,788
one way or the other,
so why don't we just get on with it?

330
00:22:34,918 --> 00:22:39,038
So when the rogue comet hit the asteroid
belt, it sent shrapnel right for us.

331
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,680
For the next 15 days
the Earth's in a shooting gallery.

332
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,681
Even if the asteroid itself hits
the water, it's still hitting land.

333
00:22:45,802 --> 00:22:50,319
lt'll flash-boil millions
of gallons of sea water and slam
into the ocean bedrock.

334
00:22:50,443 --> 00:22:53,960
Now, if it's a Pacific Ocean impact--
which we think it will be--

335
00:22:54,085 --> 00:22:58,317
it'll create a tidal wave three miles
high, travel at 1,000 miles an hour...

336
00:22:58,445 --> 00:23:01,723
covering California
and washing up in Denver.

337
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:05,079
Japan's gone. Australia's wiped out.

338
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:08,006
Half the world's population'll be
incinerated by the heat blast...

339
00:23:08,088 --> 00:23:10,923
and the rest'll freeze to death
from nuclear winter.

340
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,841
That's unbelievable.

341
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:16,771
Well, actually,
this is as real as it gets.

342
00:23:19,172 --> 00:23:21,926
Well, it's coming, right now--

343
00:23:22,013 --> 00:23:24,971
right for us--
at 22,000 miles an hour.

344
00:23:25,053 --> 00:23:27,808
Not a soul on Earth can hide from it.

345
00:23:42,979 --> 00:23:45,016
l take it you're not
alerting everyone like this.

346
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:48,098
Nobody knows.
That's the way it stays.

347
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,736
For the next ten days, there are
only nine telescopes in the world...

348
00:23:50,822 --> 00:23:53,336
that can spot the asteroid,
and we control eight of 'em.

349
00:23:53,462 --> 00:23:56,296
The president's classified
this information top secret.

350
00:23:56,423 --> 00:23:59,063
lf news like this got out,
there'd be an overnight breakdown...

351
00:23:59,144 --> 00:24:04,014
of basic social services worldwide--
rioting, mass religious hysteria.

352
00:24:04,105 --> 00:24:06,666
Total chaos. You can imagine.

353
00:24:06,786 --> 00:24:09,745
Basically the worst parts
of the Bible.

354
00:24:12,348 --> 00:24:15,466
Six billion people on the planet--

355
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:17,546
why'd you guys call me?

356
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:20,901
- We need you to prep the team
we're sending up.
- Up?

357
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:24,388
We'll send 'em to the asteroid,
they'll land, they'll drill a hole,
they'll drop some nukes...

358
00:24:24,472 --> 00:24:27,270
take off and detonate
if we can fix this equipment problem.

359
00:24:27,352 --> 00:24:31,905
Now, the, uh, drilling unit's
a prototype we've been building
for the Mars project.

360
00:24:31,994 --> 00:24:35,431
You, uh--
you might recognize the rig.

361
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:40,072
Yeah, well, l guess l should
recognize it. lt's my design.

362
00:24:42,717 --> 00:24:44,948
What'd you do?
Steal a key to the patent office?

363
00:24:45,078 --> 00:24:47,876
- Yeah, basically.
- Let me get this straight.

364
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:52,078
l got pulled off an oil rig,
flown halfway around the world
because you stole my drill design...

365
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,631
couldn't read the plans right
and did a piss-poor job
of putting it together, is that it?

366
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:58,481
- Well, technically,
patents don't apply to outer space.
- Just shut up, Quincy.

367
00:24:58,562 --> 00:25:01,839
lt's not going to Mars any more.
lt's going to try to save this planet.

368
00:25:01,923 --> 00:25:03,914
And we need to know
what's wrong with it pretty quick.

369
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,915
You said we did a bad job
of putting it together?

370
00:25:06,044 --> 00:25:09,276
No, l said you did a piss-poor job
of putting it together.

371
00:25:09,405 --> 00:25:11,441
First of all, you got
the flow system all reversed.

372
00:25:11,525 --> 00:25:15,725
Let me guess: you've been tearin' up
rotors and you can't figure out why.

373
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:19,596
- Yeah, that's right, actually.
- Well, that's because your cams
are all wrong, Mr Wizard.

374
00:25:19,688 --> 00:25:23,444
- Who's been operating this thing?
- Right there.

375
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:26,567
W-We've actually-- we've had them
training for eight months solid now.

376
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:29,364
- Eight whole months?
- Well, pretty much, yeah.

377
00:25:29,491 --> 00:25:32,768
- Well, gee whiz.
- Well, this is the team
that has to do the job up there.

378
00:25:32,892 --> 00:25:34,804
We need you to train 'em down here.

379
00:25:34,893 --> 00:25:36,884
Well, Mr Stamper, what do you think?

380
00:25:37,013 --> 00:25:39,609
You know, drilling's a science.
lt's an art.

381
00:25:39,695 --> 00:25:41,845
l'm a third-generation driller,
doin' it all my life...

382
00:25:41,975 --> 00:25:44,409
and l still haven't got it
all figured out.

383
00:25:44,535 --> 00:25:47,813
l assume you sent for me because
somebody told you l was the best.

384
00:25:47,937 --> 00:25:50,371
Well, l'm only the best
because l work with the best.

385
00:25:50,497 --> 00:25:54,013
You don't trust the men you're
working with, you're as good as dead.

386
00:25:54,138 --> 00:25:56,175
Now, you want to send
these boys into space, fine.

387
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,256
l'm sure they'll make
good astronauts.

388
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,848
But they don't know jack
about drillin'.

389
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:03,502
- What's your contingency plan?
- Contingency plan?

390
00:26:03,622 --> 00:26:06,261
Your backup plan. You gotta have
some kind of backup plan, right?

391
00:26:06,382 --> 00:26:09,261
- No, we don't have a backup plan.
This is it.
- And this is the best that you could--

392
00:26:09,383 --> 00:26:12,855
that the-the government,
the U.S. government can come up with?

393
00:26:12,945 --> 00:26:16,096
l mean, y-you're NASA, for cryin'
out loud. You put a man on the moon.

394
00:26:16,225 --> 00:26:19,343
You're geniuses! Y-You're the guys
that think this shit up.

395
00:26:19,466 --> 00:26:21,776
l'm sure you got a team of men
sittin' around somewhere right now...

396
00:26:21,907 --> 00:26:24,138
just thinkin' shit up
and somebody backin' them up.

397
00:26:24,268 --> 00:26:26,862
You tellin' me you don't have
a backup plan, that these
eight Boy Scouts right here...

398
00:26:26,988 --> 00:26:29,743
that is the world's hope,
that's what you're tellin' me?

399
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:32,907
- Yeah.
- Oh, Jesus. Damn it.

400
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:37,382
We're a little short on time here.
Will you help us?

401
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:44,466
- All they gotta do is drill?
- That's it.

402
00:26:44,593 --> 00:26:46,984
No spacewalkin',
no crazy astronaut stuff?

403
00:26:47,075 --> 00:26:49,748
Just drill.

404
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:52,231
How many men were you plannin'
on takin' up there?

405
00:26:52,316 --> 00:26:54,228
We're sendin' up
two shuttles, two teams.

406
00:26:54,357 --> 00:26:56,473
lf l do this,
l'm gonna wanna take my own men.

407
00:26:56,597 --> 00:26:58,589
You got it.

408
00:26:58,718 --> 00:27:01,552
So you're saying you'll help us?

409
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,432
Yes, sir.

410
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,556
Thanks.

411
00:27:11,362 --> 00:27:14,116
l just don't trust anybody else
to do it, that's all.

412
00:27:17,363 --> 00:27:19,959
No, Mrs Curlene,
it's Harry Stamper.

413
00:27:20,045 --> 00:27:23,674
lf you see Bear, you tell him
Harry's lookin' for him.

414
00:27:23,805 --> 00:27:27,243
Those guys get off this rig,
they scatter. J. Otis Curlene Bear--

415
00:27:27,367 --> 00:27:31,156
probably the only black man
on a big hog in Kadoka, South Dakota.

416
00:27:31,248 --> 00:27:33,637
Come and get Papa Bear!

417
00:27:35,849 --> 00:27:38,762
- Uh, Max.
- You got a weight limit on the shuttle?

418
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:42,842
- Max.
- Hey, Mama.

419
00:27:42,932 --> 00:27:47,165
- Oh, that's so sweet, Maxie.
- Hey, did ya get me one of them
yellow jelly bear claws l like?

420
00:27:47,293 --> 00:27:49,284
Maxie, are you in trouble
with the law again?

421
00:27:49,413 --> 00:27:51,085
- No, Mama.
- Maxie.

422
00:27:51,214 --> 00:27:53,012
l swear, Mama, l'm--

423
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:57,405
- You know l want Rockhound.
- We call him Hound because...

424
00:27:57,495 --> 00:27:59,806
well, um, he's horny.

425
00:28:01,897 --> 00:28:05,015
Well, you might want to start
with every bar in New Orleans.

426
00:28:05,138 --> 00:28:07,937
That is a big, shiny mount,
isn't it?

427
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,215
- How long you been married?
- For two weeks.

428
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,530
- See this diamond?
- Yeah?

429
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,334
- lt's not a diamond.
Would you like another drink?
- Yeah.

430
00:28:15,421 --> 00:28:17,936
- Sir, FBl.
- She's so cute.

431
00:28:18,062 --> 00:28:20,098
- No, thanks.
- We have a national security matter.

432
00:28:20,182 --> 00:28:22,060
- Good for you.
- Let's go.

433
00:28:22,143 --> 00:28:25,295
- Now.
- How old are you?

434
00:28:25,424 --> 00:28:28,656
Oscar Choice-- spacey
but absolutely brilliant geologist.

435
00:28:28,785 --> 00:28:31,346
He owns a horse ranch
outside of El Paso.

436
00:28:33,747 --> 00:28:35,658
What the--

437
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:42,630
Mr Chick Chapel, at the craps table,
Caesar's Palace, Las Vegas, Nevada.

438
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:45,423
Yes! About time.

439
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,819
Charles Chapel, game's over.

440
00:28:51,512 --> 00:28:53,309
Who's gonna run the other rig?

441
00:28:53,433 --> 00:28:55,389
How 'bout Benny? He's good.

442
00:28:55,513 --> 00:28:58,312
The only one knows
how to run it as well as l do is A.J.

443
00:28:58,434 --> 00:29:00,710
l thought you said
you couldn't trust him.

444
00:29:00,835 --> 00:29:03,224
l thought you said l could.

445
00:29:04,315 --> 00:29:06,911
Yep, you are on your way, A.J.

446
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:10,428
Well, you know, bein' in business
for yourself has its advantages--

447
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:13,516
make my own hours,
nobody shoots me in the leg.

448
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,078
You don't got
a gun on ya now, do ya? Oh, good.

449
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:22,593
'Cause l kinda wanted to get back
to this whole thing
about you askin' me for help.

450
00:29:22,722 --> 00:29:27,513
Does that mean that there's actually
a job that Mr All-Go-No-Quit-Big-Nuts...

451
00:29:27,643 --> 00:29:30,680
Harry Stamper can't handle by himself...

452
00:29:30,763 --> 00:29:33,199
and needs my expert advice?

453
00:29:33,325 --> 00:29:35,885
- Somethin' like that, yeah.
- Well, no, no, no.

454
00:29:36,005 --> 00:29:38,440
l mean, is it-it something like that,
or is it that?

455
00:29:39,727 --> 00:29:42,241
You know,
you and me got a real problem.

456
00:29:42,367 --> 00:29:45,280
You know, Harry,
there are only, uh...

457
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:48,321
five words l wanna hear
from you right now.

458
00:29:48,409 --> 00:29:52,642
And those words are: ''You know, A.J.,
l really look up to you.

459
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:55,205
''You've been a hero of mine
for a long time, and...

460
00:29:55,331 --> 00:29:58,563
l'm very impressed with your work;
l'm emotionally closed off.''

461
00:29:58,652 --> 00:30:00,644
That's like--
that's like 11 words or somethin'.

462
00:30:00,733 --> 00:30:05,570
You know what? How about just,
''A.J., l'm sorry, and-- and l love ya.''

463
00:30:05,655 --> 00:30:08,010
You know, A.J.,
there's not a job on the planet...

464
00:30:08,095 --> 00:30:10,131
that l want you
to work with me on.

465
00:30:12,216 --> 00:30:14,014
l mean that.

466
00:30:15,337 --> 00:30:19,217
So what are you doin' here?
Harry, what's the job?

467
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:23,616
- Big Daddy!
- What's up, baby?

468
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,696
Yeah, big Bear.
What's up? What's up?

469
00:30:28,501 --> 00:30:31,619
What's up, Harry?
Did NASA find oil on Uranus, man?

470
00:30:39,465 --> 00:30:42,741
None of you have to go.
We can all just sit here on Earth...

471
00:30:42,825 --> 00:30:47,457
wait for this big rock to crash into it,
kill everything and everybody we know.

472
00:30:49,227 --> 00:30:53,187
The United States government
just asked us to save the world.

473
00:30:53,308 --> 00:30:56,985
- Anybody wanna say no?
- Twenty years--

474
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:01,150
haven't turned ya down once,
not about to start now.

475
00:31:01,231 --> 00:31:05,510
- l'm there.
- Guess l can't let you
go up there alone.

476
00:31:05,632 --> 00:31:07,305
l'm with you.

477
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:10,106
l mean, this is--
this is historic.

478
00:31:10,193 --> 00:31:13,312
Guys, this is
like deep blue hero stuff.

479
00:31:13,395 --> 00:31:17,628
- Of course l'm in.
- While l don't share his enthusiasm...

480
00:31:17,716 --> 00:31:21,710
you know me-- beam me up, Scotty.

481
00:31:21,837 --> 00:31:24,511
- You all right, Max?
- l-l don't-- l-l don't--

482
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:29,190
Whatever you think.

483
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,676
- What about you?
- l'm in.

484
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,592
All right, then.

485
00:31:36,122 --> 00:31:38,397
We go.

486
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:41,680
l don't mean to be the materialistic
weasel of this group, but...

487
00:31:41,803 --> 00:31:43,920
you think we'll get
hazard pay out of this?

488
00:31:44,044 --> 00:31:46,434
lf you're trying to make me feel better
about this scenario, give it up.

489
00:31:46,525 --> 00:31:50,313
To tell you the truth, l'm kind of
encouraged. This guy Chick here was
an Air Force commando for six years.

490
00:31:50,445 --> 00:31:53,837
We got robbery, assault,
arrest, resisting arrest.

491
00:31:53,967 --> 00:31:57,119
We got a collection agent
for the mob. Two of these guys
have done serious time.

492
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:59,403
-Look, they're the best at what they do.
-So am l.

493
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:01,320
And l'm not
so optimistic.

494
00:32:01,409 --> 00:32:04,368
We spend $250 billion
a year on defence.

495
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,924
And here we are. The fate
of the planet is in the hands...

496
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:09,526
of a bunch of retards l wouldn't
trust with a potato gun.

497
00:32:13,773 --> 00:32:16,890
- So what's the verdict?
- They'll do it.

498
00:32:17,014 --> 00:32:20,530
- They've made a few requests though.
- Such as?

499
00:32:22,215 --> 00:32:24,047
Just a few things here, uh--

500
00:32:27,497 --> 00:32:30,410
Nothing really big, just--
Well, as an example--

501
00:32:30,498 --> 00:32:35,893
Uh, Oscar here's got some
outstanding parking tickets.
Wants 'em wiped off his record.

502
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:39,410
- Fifty-six tickets in seven states.
- l'll tell him, Oscar. l got it.

503
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,335
- Okay.
- Uh, Noonan's got two women friends...

504
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:45,420
that he'd like to see made
American citizens, no questions asked.

505
00:32:45,542 --> 00:32:49,821
Max would like you to bring back
eight track tapes.

506
00:32:49,943 --> 00:32:53,733
Not sure if that's gonna work,
but let's see what else.

507
00:32:53,865 --> 00:32:58,736
Chick wants a full week's Emperor's
Package at Caesar's Palace, um--

508
00:32:59,787 --> 00:33:02,460
Hey, you guys wouldn't
be able to tell us who
actually killed Kennedy, would ya?

509
00:33:06,508 --> 00:33:09,661
Uh, Bear would like to stay
at the...

510
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:12,901
White Horse, the--

511
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:15,421
White House.
White House.

512
00:33:15,552 --> 00:33:20,388
White House. Yeah, he'd like
to stay in the Lincoln Bedroom
of the White House for the summer.

513
00:33:20,473 --> 00:33:23,750
- Stuff like that.
- Sure, l think we can, uh...

514
00:33:23,874 --> 00:33:27,265
take care of some of that.

515
00:33:27,355 --> 00:33:29,186
Harry!

516
00:33:30,636 --> 00:33:33,674
Yeah, one more thing. Um--

517
00:33:33,797 --> 00:33:36,915
None of them wanna
pay taxes again.

518
00:33:38,678 --> 00:33:41,318
Ever.

519
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,201
Who's that for?
Mr Ed?

520
00:33:49,322 --> 00:33:52,952
You stick that in me, l'm gonna
stab you in the heart with it.
You ever see Pulp Fiction?

521
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:57,680
Oh, say can you see

522
00:33:59,765 --> 00:34:02,325
We're losin' him,
we're losin' him. Clear! Kaboom!

523
00:34:02,405 --> 00:34:05,240
- Freddie, you all right?
- Does this look okay to you?

524
00:34:05,367 --> 00:34:09,361
- Does this look okay?
- lt's not all bad. lt's kinda tingly.

525
00:34:09,488 --> 00:34:11,797
Mr Chapel, you're next!

526
00:34:11,928 --> 00:34:14,683
Oh, gee, lady,
l just came here to drill.

527
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,607
Oh, so did l.

528
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,843
Your triglycerides
are way high...

529
00:34:21,932 --> 00:34:24,571
and your bad cholesterol
is shockingly bad.

530
00:34:24,692 --> 00:34:27,685
- Tell ya to lay off
those pork rinds, Pooh Bear.
- Yeah, pork rind this.

531
00:34:27,813 --> 00:34:31,045
Pork rinds this!
Yeah!

532
00:34:31,174 --> 00:34:32,972
Take it off, baby!

533
00:34:35,295 --> 00:34:37,890
Well, at least
they're in good spirits.

534
00:34:40,977 --> 00:34:44,573
Piece of cake.
Look, you wanna compare brain pans?

535
00:34:44,658 --> 00:34:47,332
l won the Westinghouse Prize
when l was 12. Big deal.

536
00:34:47,459 --> 00:34:51,248
Published at 19. So what? l got
a double doctorate from M.l.T. at 22.

537
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:54,572
Chemistry and geology.
l taught at Princeton for 2 1/2 years.

538
00:34:54,701 --> 00:34:58,741
You know, l think this might be
the most uncomfortable room
l've ever been in in my life.

539
00:34:58,862 --> 00:35:01,741
Why do l do this? Because the money's
good, the scenery changes...

540
00:35:01,863 --> 00:35:04,139
and they let me use
explosives, okay?

541
00:35:04,264 --> 00:35:06,859
Okay, you wanna be
all psychological with me, that's fine.

542
00:35:06,985 --> 00:35:09,021
l'll tell you one thing
that really drives me nuts...

543
00:35:09,105 --> 00:35:12,861
is people who think that Jethro Tull
is just a person in the band.

544
00:35:12,947 --> 00:35:14,778
Who is Jethro Tull?

545
00:35:14,867 --> 00:35:18,941
My favourite dish is haggis--
heart, lungs, liver.

546
00:35:19,028 --> 00:35:23,660
You shove that all in a sheep's stomach,
then you boil it.
That'll put some hair on your ass.

547
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:27,022
l am not crazy. l'm just
a little emotional right now, okay?

548
00:35:27,151 --> 00:35:29,712
You all throwin' all this stuff
at me, man. Look-- get-- l mean--

549
00:35:29,832 --> 00:35:32,187
After this is over, could l, like,
get a hug from you or somethin'?

550
00:35:34,593 --> 00:35:36,425
Okay, Cyclops lady's
startin' to bug me.

551
00:35:36,514 --> 00:35:39,348
- Can you handle it?
- l mean, l can handle what l'm,
you know, l'm gonna do.

552
00:35:39,475 --> 00:35:41,272
l can handle that, but l don't know
if l can handle this room.

553
00:35:41,395 --> 00:35:43,192
Woman with large breasts.

554
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:48,675
- Woman with medium breasts.
- Here's Harry givin' me a hard time.

555
00:35:48,797 --> 00:35:51,107
And, uh, this is Harry tellin' me
it's not good enough.

556
00:35:51,198 --> 00:35:54,590
And, uh, this is Harry tellin' me
l can't marry his daughter.
Thanks a lot. l appreciate it.

557
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,393
Just let it out.

558
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,871
l suffered a major head injury
when l was in high school.

559
00:36:00,961 --> 00:36:03,157
This one looks like you...
with breasts.

560
00:36:03,242 --> 00:36:05,278
Yeah, l can handle it.
Yeah, l can handle it.

561
00:36:06,603 --> 00:36:10,643
A home run! The Cubs win
the World Series!

562
00:36:12,325 --> 00:36:15,476
Fail. Fail.
Depressively fail.

563
00:36:15,605 --> 00:36:18,519
One toxicology analysis
revealed ketamine.

564
00:36:18,647 --> 00:36:22,357
- That is a very powerful sedative.
- Sedatives are used
all the time, Doctor.

565
00:36:22,488 --> 00:36:24,365
Well, this one's used on horses.

566
00:36:25,928 --> 00:36:27,807
Some of these guys
are pretty big.

567
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:30,199
lt would normally take 18 months
to psychologically prepare...

568
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:32,679
prescreen viable subjects
for space travel.

569
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:37,840
- We have seen evidence of a wide
variety of territorial aggression.
- Can they physically survive the trip?

570
00:36:37,932 --> 00:36:42,768
- That's all l need to know here, okay?
- Personally, l don't know how
they survived the tests.

571
00:36:47,615 --> 00:36:49,492
Talk about the wrong stuff.

572
00:36:53,497 --> 00:36:55,568
Good morning.
l'm Colonel Willie Sharp.

573
00:36:55,698 --> 00:36:58,292
ln addition to flying one of
the X-71 teams to that rock...

574
00:36:58,418 --> 00:37:02,379
my job is to train you how to deal
with the mental and physical
rigors of working in space...

575
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,896
so you don't freak out
on the asteroid.

576
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:09,298
United States astronauts
train for years.

577
00:37:09,422 --> 00:37:11,219
You have 12 days.

578
00:37:11,342 --> 00:37:13,573
Do we have any intelligent questions
before we get started?

579
00:37:15,263 --> 00:37:19,338
- What's an X-71?
- You're the first civilians
to ever see her.

580
00:37:20,785 --> 00:37:22,696
We call 'em the X-71s.

581
00:37:22,825 --> 00:37:25,261
lt's a top secret joint venture
with the Air Force.

582
00:37:25,347 --> 00:37:28,225
She and her sister ship at Vandenberg
are leaving tomorrow
for launch prep in Florida...

583
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:29,861
but l thought
you oughta take a look.

584
00:37:29,988 --> 00:37:32,901
The two shuttles going up are
the Freedom and the lndependence.

585
00:37:32,989 --> 00:37:36,221
Her titanium alloy impenetrable skin
covers the toughest, meanest...

586
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:39,228
most sophisticated space vehicle
man has ever made.

587
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:41,661
Okay, Air Force Colonel Davis,
NASA pilot Tucker...

588
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:43,589
will command the shuttle
lndependence.

589
00:37:43,712 --> 00:37:47,183
Air Force Colonel Sharp,
NASA pilot Watts, shuttle Freedom.

590
00:37:47,273 --> 00:37:51,393
Munitions specialist Gruber and Halsey
will supervise the nuclear ordnance.

591
00:37:51,515 --> 00:37:54,632
Anyway, uh, l just thought, uh--

592
00:37:54,755 --> 00:37:56,792
thought you guys should meet.

593
00:37:59,437 --> 00:38:03,067
Gentlemen, welcome to our weightless
environmental training facility.

594
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,994
So we're going swimming on this
asteroid? ls that what this is for?

595
00:38:13,121 --> 00:38:16,876
Here at downtown NASA,
we call this the ''Monster Armadillo.''

596
00:38:17,002 --> 00:38:21,201
Gonna be retrofitted
with your drilling arm. She'll turn
800 turbo horses in near zero gravity.

597
00:38:21,323 --> 00:38:25,113
Mind if we take a look at her now?
All these rubber hoses gotta go, Max.
Count 'em up.

598
00:38:25,245 --> 00:38:28,157
Make sure it's
short-throw shiftin'.

599
00:38:28,245 --> 00:38:31,683
Quincy!
Somebody tell me what this is.

600
00:38:31,807 --> 00:38:35,687
Plastic ice cream scoop?
What'd that cost? About $400?

601
00:38:35,768 --> 00:38:40,479
This is about the sorriest group
of people l've seen in all
my entire military career.

602
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:43,448
Your space flight's gonna be
a brutal assault on your senses.

603
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:47,690
l'm here to give you a taste
of that. NASA's got some of
the finest pilots in the world.

604
00:38:47,772 --> 00:38:50,730
They're gonna be suckin' your eyes
into the back of your heads.

605
00:38:52,053 --> 00:38:54,567
Go easy on me, okay?
lt's my first time.

606
00:38:54,653 --> 00:38:57,453
l just wanna seriously say
l have a small fear of flying.

607
00:38:59,495 --> 00:39:01,372
l'm gonna twist ya.

608
00:39:04,697 --> 00:39:06,892
- And l'm gonna flip ya.
- What's the matter with you?

609
00:39:08,218 --> 00:39:10,573
Frap your body
till your bones hurt.

610
00:39:10,658 --> 00:39:13,537
When you squeal, l'm just
gonna go faster and harder.

611
00:39:13,659 --> 00:39:17,130
No, take me down!

612
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,822
- How's the rest of the crew?
- Well, uh--

613
00:39:20,902 --> 00:39:23,370
Sorry about the rib chunks
all over your dashboard.

614
00:39:25,583 --> 00:39:27,892
Don't forget:
We gotta X-ray all these--

615
00:39:28,023 --> 00:39:31,176
- lf you had to say, who would you say?
- l don't know, Oscar.
Who do you think you are?

616
00:39:31,265 --> 00:39:34,575
- Han Solo.
- No. lf anybody's anybody, l'm Han.

617
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,503
And you're--
you're Chewbacca.

618
00:39:36,626 --> 00:39:39,300
Chewie? Have you even
seen Star Wars?

619
00:39:39,427 --> 00:39:41,783
All right, men, let's go.
Step it up.

620
00:39:46,349 --> 00:39:50,389
Neil Armstrong, 1969,
bouncing on the moon.

621
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:53,508
He's bouncing because there's
less gravity up there than on Earth.

622
00:39:53,631 --> 00:39:57,102
This will be similar
to the asteroid, so watch it.

623
00:39:57,192 --> 00:39:59,627
Something gets launched off
that asteroid with enough force...

624
00:39:59,753 --> 00:40:01,983
it's gonna keep on going
right into outer space.

625
00:40:02,113 --> 00:40:05,630
What is the deal?
ls it just me, or is Watts really hot?

626
00:40:05,715 --> 00:40:07,546
Yeah.

627
00:40:07,635 --> 00:40:11,312
So we have these new generation suits
with directional accelerant thrusters.

628
00:40:11,437 --> 00:40:13,234
- You won't bounce like Neil Armstrong.
- Yeah, think so?

629
00:40:13,357 --> 00:40:14,916
- Bear!
- Yes?

630
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:17,950
- Do we have a problem?
- No.

631
00:40:18,038 --> 00:40:21,874
'Cause l'm trying to describe
to you how these D.A.T.s
keep your ass on the ground...

632
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,116
so that if l were to kick you
in the balls...

633
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,835
and you don't know how to work them,
what happens to you?

634
00:40:26,961 --> 00:40:29,351
- l float away.
- Yeah.

635
00:40:29,482 --> 00:40:32,202
And, uh, when do we
start training for that?

636
00:40:32,323 --> 00:40:34,598
Gentlemen, l'll give you 30 seconds
to put your helmets on...

637
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:36,880
then the oxygen will be sucked
out of this vacuum...

638
00:40:37,005 --> 00:40:39,235
and you will know what it's like
to be in space.

639
00:40:39,325 --> 00:40:40,883
Go!

640
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:44,204
Depressed in 30 seconds.

641
00:40:44,327 --> 00:40:46,283
Main valves have been activated.

642
00:40:46,367 --> 00:40:49,565
Vacuum P.S.l.s are open.

643
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:06,010
Okay, gentlemen,
so here's the flight plan.

644
00:41:06,133 --> 00:41:08,728
Now, let's keep the laughter to
a minimum. l know this is not to scale.

645
00:41:08,854 --> 00:41:13,724
Both shuttles will take off
Tuesday at 6:30 p.m.

646
00:41:13,855 --> 00:41:15,653
Now, 67 minutes later...

647
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:19,929
you're gonna dock with the Russian space
station to meet cosmonaut Andropov...

648
00:41:20,057 --> 00:41:22,936
who will refuel the shuttles
with liquid O2.

649
00:41:23,018 --> 00:41:25,487
That's your fuel.
Then you'll release...

650
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:28,259
and take a 60-hour trip
toward the moon.

651
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:32,009
Now, we only have one shot
of landing on this rock...

652
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,731
and that's precisely when
the asteroid passes by the moon.

653
00:41:35,862 --> 00:41:38,616
You'll then use lunar gravity
and burn your thrusters...

654
00:41:38,743 --> 00:41:41,975
slingshotting you
around the moon...

655
00:41:42,104 --> 00:41:44,380
coming up behind the asteroid.

656
00:41:44,465 --> 00:41:47,582
- You'll be upward of 11 Gs.
- Yeah, l remember this one.

657
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:50,938
lt's where the, uh, the coyote
sat his ass down in a slingshot...

658
00:41:51,027 --> 00:41:52,858
then he strapped himself
to an Acme rocket.

659
00:41:52,947 --> 00:41:55,746
- ls-ls that what we're doin' here?
- Rockhound.

660
00:41:55,868 --> 00:41:58,622
- No, no, really, because it didn't
work out too well for the coyote, Harry.
- Hey, Rock.

661
00:41:58,709 --> 00:42:02,942
- Remember that one?
- Well, actually, we have a lot better
rockets than the coyote.

662
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:08,711
Now, when you've finished
your Road Runner thrust move...

663
00:42:08,832 --> 00:42:12,462
you'll be moving
at 22,500 miles per hour.

664
00:42:12,593 --> 00:42:15,188
Coming around behind the asteroid,
where we're hoping...

665
00:42:15,314 --> 00:42:17,545
that the tail debris'll be
cleared by the moon's gravity.

666
00:42:17,675 --> 00:42:19,745
And you'll land right here.
That's it.

667
00:42:19,875 --> 00:42:23,995
We got separate landing sites
for each team. Softest parts
of the rock as we can figure.

668
00:42:24,117 --> 00:42:27,713
At NASA, we don't take chances.
We double up on everything.

669
00:42:27,798 --> 00:42:30,358
First team
that hits 800 feet wins.

670
00:42:30,478 --> 00:42:34,314
Now this rock is big, it's dense, it's
got some gravity. You can walk around.

671
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,789
But use your thrusters
so you can work easier.

672
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,881
Okay, Mr Truman, let's say that
we actually do land on this.

673
00:42:40,962 --> 00:42:42,953
What's it gonna be like
up there?

674
00:42:43,082 --> 00:42:46,155
Two hundred degrees in the sunlight.
Minus 200 in the shade.

675
00:42:46,243 --> 00:42:50,875
Canyons of razor-sharp rock.
Unpredictable gravitational conditions.

676
00:42:51,005 --> 00:42:54,042
Unexpected eruptions.
Things like that.

677
00:42:54,165 --> 00:42:57,284
Okay, so the scariest
environment imaginable. Thanks.

678
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:59,284
That's all you gotta say:
scariest environment imaginable.

679
00:42:59,367 --> 00:43:02,804
Okay, so you drill,
you drop the nuke, and you leave.

680
00:43:02,888 --> 00:43:07,486
Now, here's the key:
You're gonna remote detonate the bomb...

681
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:11,762
before the asteroid
passes this plane-- Zero Barrier.

682
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:15,487
You do that, and the remaining
pieces of rock...

683
00:43:15,612 --> 00:43:18,685
should be deflected enough
to pass right by us.

684
00:43:18,813 --> 00:43:21,202
Now, if the bomb explodes
after Zero Barrier--

685
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:25,970
game's over.

686
00:43:26,055 --> 00:43:28,364
Paul, this is Houston.
Fire your rockets.

687
00:43:29,616 --> 00:43:32,893
- Okay, your rockets are maximum.
Beautiful boost.
- Oscar!

688
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:35,173
Hey, Harry. Hey, how's it goin'?

689
00:43:35,298 --> 00:43:37,937
- Have you seen Grace?
-Yeah, she's over in the hangar
with A.J.

690
00:43:38,058 --> 00:43:41,052
Harry, wait a second. Did you say Grace?
Okay, l thought you said Bear.

691
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:19,068
Will you marry me?

692
00:44:32,475 --> 00:44:34,272
Grace is old enough
to vote, Harry.

693
00:44:34,395 --> 00:44:37,230
She's old enough to have a drink or
get married if she wants, get a divorce.

694
00:44:37,317 --> 00:44:40,309
Let me tell you something, fellas. When
l get back, when we get this job done...

695
00:44:40,437 --> 00:44:42,235
l will deal with this
in my own way.

696
00:44:42,358 --> 00:44:44,394
Come on, Harry. lt's not like
l'm rootin' for A.J. here.

697
00:44:44,478 --> 00:44:46,675
- l'm just sayin',
Grace is not a little girl any more.
- Hey, Rock, you know, wait a minute.

698
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,156
Let me get a pencil and
a piece of paper. l wanna jot down
all your pearls of wisdom here.

699
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,552
Get serious, Harry. Come on. While we're
off trottin' the globe, hunting mud...

700
00:44:53,682 --> 00:44:56,276
Gracie grew up to become
a full-blown hottie, you know?

701
00:44:56,362 --> 00:44:58,752
- Harry, she is fully hot. She is--
- She's a babe.

702
00:44:58,883 --> 00:45:02,320
Max, Max, okay. You're talkin'
about my little girl, all right?

703
00:45:02,404 --> 00:45:04,600
l think l know
who and what she is, okay?

704
00:45:04,685 --> 00:45:08,395
Okay, but Harry, all we're sayin' is,
we're talkin' about a kid who's
comin' into her own right now.

705
00:45:08,486 --> 00:45:12,958
And she's gettin' curious about her body
and she's exploring her sexuality.
And you know what?

706
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:15,158
- Oscar.
- That's a natural thing.

707
00:45:15,288 --> 00:45:18,679
You are about five minutes older than
Grace is. Why should l listen to you?

708
00:45:18,809 --> 00:45:22,689
And l know what it feels like to have
your hormones pullin' you in just, you
know, a thousand different directions.

709
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:26,242
- You don't know which end is up.
- Yo, Harry, no disrespect, man,
but we all helped to raise her.

710
00:45:26,372 --> 00:45:30,525
- So, in part, we all feel
like a bunch of daddies here.
- That's true.

711
00:45:30,613 --> 00:45:35,324
l'll be damned if l worked all
these years so my little girl
can marry a roughneck.

712
00:45:37,415 --> 00:45:39,804
She's better than that.

713
00:45:39,935 --> 00:45:42,131
Better than all of us.

714
00:45:49,378 --> 00:45:53,089
Harry, just sit back, relax.
l'm gonna put on a little
free Armadillo driving clinic for ya.

715
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:55,250
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

716
00:46:01,622 --> 00:46:06,981
Two shuttle teams. A.J.'ll be
running the drill team with Oscar,
Bear and Noonan on the lndependence.

717
00:46:07,063 --> 00:46:10,216
l'll run the drill team on Freedom
with Chick, Rockhound and Max.

718
00:46:10,305 --> 00:46:12,865
Once we land, we'll have
eight hours to get the job done.

719
00:46:12,985 --> 00:46:16,866
ln order to split this rock
on the fault line,
we're gonna have to drill to 800 feet.

720
00:46:16,987 --> 00:46:21,140
Let's get our game faces on.
Now it's time for underwater simulation.

721
00:46:22,148 --> 00:46:25,300
Come on, lndependence. Keep it up.
Let's go. We're the younger team here.

722
00:46:25,429 --> 00:46:28,467
We're the varsity team.
Take it to 11,000.

723
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:31,344
Okay, gentlemen, we're gonna
trick 'em up. My computer
will simulate a gas pocket...

724
00:46:31,471 --> 00:46:35,670
at 625 feet and then
hard iron ferrite at 635.

725
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:39,388
l'm gonna draw up some more O2 in.
We're takin' her up.

726
00:46:39,513 --> 00:46:42,074
- l'm givin' it more torque right now.
- All right, lookin' good, Bear.

727
00:46:42,154 --> 00:46:44,623
Clamp it down. Watch your time,
lndependence team.

728
00:46:44,755 --> 00:46:46,711
Thanks, Harry. Would you mind
lettin' me run my own team?

729
00:46:46,795 --> 00:46:48,832
You're gonna blow the tranny, A.J.
Slow it down, baby.

730
00:46:48,956 --> 00:46:51,266
Take it easy, Bear.
Just relax. She can handle it.

731
00:46:51,397 --> 00:46:56,347
A.J., you're at 600 feet.
Your pipe is long.
Let's back the R.P.M.s down to 8,000.

732
00:46:56,478 --> 00:46:59,199
- We don't have time for 8,000!
- A.J., take it back down.

733
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,470
You're gonna snap the pipe.
l don't wanna blow this transmission.

734
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,591
- Damn it, 11,000.
- Slow it down, A.J.

735
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,714
Bear, come on.
Get on our team for a little bit.

736
00:47:06,842 --> 00:47:10,233
- Whoa, space cowboy.
- Harry, are you listenin' to this?
- Yeah, l'm listenin', Bear.

737
00:47:10,363 --> 00:47:12,399
Harry? You don't work for Harry
any more, okay?

738
00:47:12,523 --> 00:47:15,197
Out there you gotta listen to me.
When we're on that rock,
you gotta do what l say.

739
00:47:15,324 --> 00:47:18,237
Now send more to the turbine.
l'm throttling up to 11,000.

740
00:47:18,365 --> 00:47:20,799
A.J., back it off.
You're gonna blow the transmission.

741
00:47:20,925 --> 00:47:23,680
Hey, Harry, would you let me
run my team, please?

742
00:47:23,767 --> 00:47:26,156
-R.P.M.s are at red line.
-Bear, goddam it, l know what l'm doing.

743
00:47:26,287 --> 00:47:28,756
Come on. She can handle this.
She'll be fine. Trust me.

744
00:47:28,848 --> 00:47:31,886
- A.J., back the R--
- Transmission overload.
- Number one transmission is down.

745
00:47:32,009 --> 00:47:35,764
Oh, son of a--
The computer's wrong, and you know that.

746
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:39,042
- We did the right thing.
- We're gonna restart the simulation.

747
00:47:39,131 --> 00:47:42,010
lf you wanna replace a member
of the crew, now is the time.

748
00:47:42,132 --> 00:47:45,125
l'll take care of this.
Get him out of the tank, Chick.

749
00:47:48,895 --> 00:47:51,568
- You wanna go home?
ls that it? You wanna be fired?
- No, l don't.

750
00:47:51,695 --> 00:47:53,765
- My crew was doing the right thing.
- Your crew?

751
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:56,496
- Yeah.
- Your crew just blew
the transmission, A.J.!

752
00:47:56,577 --> 00:48:00,571
Listen, that NASA computer is just
playin' it safe. The machine you built,
the rig, could do it.

753
00:48:00,698 --> 00:48:02,734
Shut up. Just shut up!
Shut your mouth!

754
00:48:02,818 --> 00:48:06,654
Those men in that room
have zero tolerance
for showin' off, hot doggin'...

755
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:10,568
goin' by your gut instinct or
you tryin' to be a hero, you got that?

756
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:12,897
- Say the words, A.J.!
- l got it!

757
00:48:13,022 --> 00:48:15,855
- l want my men to have
tomorrow night off.
- What do you mean ''off''?

758
00:48:15,942 --> 00:48:19,618
l mean, off. Out of here. For at least
ten hours. Then we'll go to Kennedy.

759
00:48:19,743 --> 00:48:23,943
Well, there's no possible way we can
do that, Harry. There's a potentially
huge security risk. What if they talk?

760
00:48:24,065 --> 00:48:26,977
- What if they get hurt?
- What if they're too burned out
to do the right thing?

761
00:48:27,105 --> 00:48:29,462
What if they get up there,
and they forget what
they're fighting for?

762
00:48:29,547 --> 00:48:32,015
You see what's goin' on up there.
These boys are ready to snap.

763
00:48:32,107 --> 00:48:34,224
They didn't ask to be here.
They got pulled off the street.

764
00:48:34,308 --> 00:48:36,776
For all we know, tomorrow night could be
the last night they ever see Earth.

765
00:48:36,868 --> 00:48:38,986
l don't think it's too much to ask to
let 'em spend it with their families.

766
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:41,465
- Well, listen, there's
no possible way we can do that.
- You got family, Colonel?

767
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:46,222
- Two girls.
- Wouldn't you like to spend tomorrow
night with your little girls?

768
00:48:46,312 --> 00:48:48,826
l'm not askin' ya.
l'm tellin' ya.

769
00:48:48,952 --> 00:48:51,228
Make this happen.

770
00:48:59,275 --> 00:49:02,587
This is a pretty big loan.
Why don't you count the cash?

771
00:49:02,677 --> 00:49:04,508
Nah, this looks like
100 grand to me.

772
00:49:04,597 --> 00:49:08,034
l'm givin' you this at 60 percent.
l hope you know what you're doin'...

773
00:49:08,158 --> 00:49:10,274
because l'll bust your head
with a sledgehammer.

774
00:49:10,358 --> 00:49:12,874
- You'll get your money back.
- You don't look too healthy.

775
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,355
You're not gonna die on me,
are ya?

776
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:19,401
Let's just say,
no more than you are. Thanks, Vic.

777
00:49:25,843 --> 00:49:29,520
Don't wanna close my eyes

778
00:49:29,645 --> 00:49:32,159
l don't wanna fall asleep

779
00:49:32,245 --> 00:49:34,202
'Cause l'd miss you, baby

780
00:49:34,326 --> 00:49:38,115
- And l don't wanna miss a thing
- You know what l was thinkin'?
- What?

781
00:49:39,928 --> 00:49:43,603
l-l really don't think that the
animal cracker qualifies as a cracker.

782
00:49:43,728 --> 00:49:46,324
- Why?
- Well, 'cause it's sweet,
which to me suggests cookie.

783
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:50,443
And, you know, putting cheese
on something is sort of
the defining characteristic...

784
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:52,762
of what makes a cracker
a cracker.

785
00:49:52,892 --> 00:49:54,689
l don't know why
l thought of that. l just--

786
00:49:54,812 --> 00:49:57,247
Baby, you have
such sweet pillow talk.

787
00:49:57,373 --> 00:50:01,526
l got a little animal cracker, Discovery
Channel thing happenin' right here.

788
00:50:01,654 --> 00:50:05,330
Watch the gazelle
as he grazes through the open plains.

789
00:50:07,135 --> 00:50:10,846
Now look
as the cheetah approaches.

790
00:50:10,977 --> 00:50:13,572
Watch
as he stalks his prey.

791
00:50:13,698 --> 00:50:16,337
Now, the gazelle's
a little spooked...

792
00:50:16,418 --> 00:50:20,936
and he could head north
to the ample sustenance...

793
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,733
provided by
the mountainous peaks above.

794
00:50:26,542 --> 00:50:28,373
He could go south.

795
00:50:29,863 --> 00:50:33,652
The gazelle now faces man's
most perilous question:

796
00:50:34,824 --> 00:50:37,862
north, or...

797
00:50:37,985 --> 00:50:40,055
south?

798
00:50:40,145 --> 00:50:44,220
Way down under.

799
00:50:46,828 --> 00:50:48,625
Tune in next week.

800
00:50:50,269 --> 00:50:52,989
Baby...

801
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:55,265
do you think it's possible
that anyone else in the world...

802
00:50:55,350 --> 00:51:00,062
is doing this very same thing
at this very same moment?

803
00:51:00,152 --> 00:51:02,302
l hope so.

804
00:51:02,432 --> 00:51:05,027
Otherwise, what the hell
are we tryin' to save?

805
00:51:10,595 --> 00:51:13,827
Don't wanna close my eyes

806
00:51:13,956 --> 00:51:18,314
l don't wanna fall asleep
'cause l'd miss you, baby

807
00:51:18,437 --> 00:51:21,908
And l don't wanna miss a thing

808
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,470
Hey.

809
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:34,673
- What are you doing here?
- l was just passin' by on the, uh--

810
00:51:34,802 --> 00:51:36,759
l came--

811
00:51:40,844 --> 00:51:44,804
- Who's he?
- That man's a salesman.

812
00:51:44,925 --> 00:51:46,961
Would you go inside?

813
00:51:50,567 --> 00:51:52,877
Thank you.

814
00:51:54,368 --> 00:51:56,563
He got big.

815
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:01,688
You can't come around like this.

816
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:05,202
The court says you can't.
lt confuses him.

817
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:07,965
No, l know. l just--

818
00:52:08,092 --> 00:52:12,245
l wanted to say
that l'm sorry...

819
00:52:12,373 --> 00:52:16,084
about everything, and...

820
00:52:16,215 --> 00:52:18,365
l got somethin' comin' up.

821
00:52:18,495 --> 00:52:22,809
lt's something kinda big.
You just might be proud of me.

822
00:52:22,937 --> 00:52:25,896
Would you do somethin' for me?
Would you just give him this?

823
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:29,852
You don't have to-- You don't have to
tell him who it's from. Just--

824
00:52:37,581 --> 00:52:39,937
Everybody talkin' about
what it is, what it ain't

825
00:52:40,022 --> 00:52:42,013
Kiss on the devil
and you piss off a saint

826
00:52:42,142 --> 00:52:44,703
But it can't be love
if you don't have to crawl

827
00:52:44,783 --> 00:52:47,776
You say you don't need nothin'
but you got to have it all

828
00:52:47,904 --> 00:52:51,295
- Come back here!
- Hey, Noonan, you need ten grand?

829
00:52:51,385 --> 00:52:53,581
- Yeah.
- We gotta put
these girls through college.

830
00:52:53,706 --> 00:52:57,461
- l love this astronaut stuff.
- All right!
- Good work if you can get it.

831
00:52:57,587 --> 00:53:00,022
Yeah, l'm just in town doin'
a little astronaut training.

832
00:53:00,148 --> 00:53:02,662
Ooh! Astronauta.

833
00:53:02,788 --> 00:53:05,065
Ah, si.
l'm a mission specialist.

834
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:08,466
- Yes, and what's that mean?
- l don't know.

835
00:53:10,831 --> 00:53:14,268
Hey! Who the hell
do you think you guys are?

836
00:53:14,392 --> 00:53:18,705
- You're hoggin' all the action.
- Hey, pinhead. Why don't you
go find your own party?

837
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:22,066
- Why don't you spread the wealth, pal?
- Here. Why don't you go
buy yourself a neck?

838
00:53:22,195 --> 00:53:24,755
Hey, Mr Clean!

839
00:53:27,276 --> 00:53:29,427
- Man! Call NASA!
- Get over there.

840
00:53:29,517 --> 00:53:31,269
- They'll confirm it! We're astronauts!
- Yeah, yeah.

841
00:53:31,357 --> 00:53:33,588
- Yeah, we're astronauts.
- Yeah, we're all astronauts.

842
00:53:33,718 --> 00:53:36,107
You are so messing with national
security right now, man.

843
00:53:36,198 --> 00:53:37,872
- Turn around.
- You are fired tomorrow morning.

844
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,639
l'm telling ya.
l'll get the ClA and the FBl.

845
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:44,600
- You'll be working security at Toys
'R' Us. Oh, oh, baby. No, no. No, no!
- Bye-bye, little astronaut.

846
00:53:44,681 --> 00:53:46,161
- Oh, it's time to go now.
- Oh, don't leave, baby. No, no.

847
00:53:46,282 --> 00:53:48,432
- You see, l'm goin' into space,
and l'm not comin' back.
- No, no, no.

848
00:53:52,723 --> 00:53:56,479
-lt's coming in at 30,000 miles an hour!
-Give me a projected impact.

849
00:53:56,565 --> 00:53:58,556
- East Asia, 11 minutes.
- We're gonna have to warn--

850
00:53:58,645 --> 00:54:01,114
Warn who?
The entire South Pacific?

851
00:54:52,542 --> 00:54:54,931
So the whole world knows.

852
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:59,695
Tell me you've never let
anybody down before.

853
00:54:59,784 --> 00:55:02,822
l never quit yet.
How's that?

854
00:55:02,945 --> 00:55:05,857
l guess that'll have to do.

855
00:55:05,985 --> 00:55:08,262
You know somethin'?

856
00:55:08,387 --> 00:55:10,696
l still remember the first,
middle and last name...

857
00:55:10,787 --> 00:55:14,258
of every guy that qualified
for the astronaut programme
the first year l was here.

858
00:55:14,348 --> 00:55:18,263
Thanks. l went
into the engineering programme.

859
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:22,025
Kinda had to.
But, boy, l wanted to go up there.

860
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:25,428
l wanted to be one of those guys
with a mission patch on my arm.

861
00:55:27,312 --> 00:55:29,429
l tell you, l'd be on that shuttle
with you, Harry, if l could.

862
00:55:33,794 --> 00:55:36,309
You don't want to be up in that shuttle
any more than l do.

863
00:55:38,875 --> 00:55:40,594
Well, good luck in Florida tomorrow.

864
00:55:40,716 --> 00:55:44,596
The death of 50,000 people in Shanghai
yesterday has rattled the na--

865
00:55:44,677 --> 00:55:47,715
A French satellite has tracked
an object in space--

866
00:55:47,798 --> 00:55:50,313
Sources are estimating
that the tidal wave was five--

867
00:55:50,439 --> 00:55:52,237
This is CNN, live in Florida.

868
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:55,557
We have just learned that NASA
is on a full-scale military alert.

869
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,116
They're calling this
a global killer.

870
00:55:58,202 --> 00:56:00,352
The government has been
very tight-lipped throughout this--

871
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:02,394
The Pentagon is getting involved
at this point with some kind...

872
00:56:02,483 --> 00:56:05,793
of a project involving NASA
and perhaps a shuttle mission--

873
00:56:05,883 --> 00:56:08,194
Senior Pentagon officials
refused comment...

874
00:56:08,325 --> 00:56:12,523
adding fuel to the speculation that
there could be a very serious problem.

875
00:56:12,645 --> 00:56:16,322
We have a special team of astronauts
that arrived in Florida this evening.

876
00:56:16,407 --> 00:56:18,284
NASA's in emergency launch
preparation...

877
00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:21,605
in cooperation with Russian, Japanese
and French space agencies...

878
00:56:21,688 --> 00:56:24,488
on the most massive
joint space venture in history.

879
00:56:32,892 --> 00:56:35,407
Gracie?

880
00:56:43,295 --> 00:56:45,126
Got your note.

881
00:56:46,015 --> 00:56:49,134
- What are you doing out here, honey?
- Um, just thinkin'.

882
00:56:50,337 --> 00:56:53,136
- Yeah.
- l, um, want to apologize to you for--

883
00:56:53,218 --> 00:56:56,256
Oh, no, Grace. Stop.
You don't have to apologize at all. l--

884
00:56:56,379 --> 00:56:57,608
l sh--

885
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:03,296
l shouldn't have dragged you around
on all those oil rigs. l just--

886
00:57:04,582 --> 00:57:06,937
l don't think that l did
the right thing with you.

887
00:57:07,022 --> 00:57:08,216
- You're wrong.
- You see--

888
00:57:08,303 --> 00:57:10,373
l love my life.

889
00:57:10,503 --> 00:57:12,574
l love everything
about my life...

890
00:57:12,704 --> 00:57:15,458
and l don't blame you
for my mother leaving.

891
00:57:17,705 --> 00:57:19,297
She left us both.

892
00:57:20,707 --> 00:57:22,982
And-And l love you.

893
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:26,305
And don't talk
like you're not comin' back.

894
00:57:27,188 --> 00:57:29,145
Promise me that you'll come back.

895
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:33,349
- Okay.
- Say, ''l promise.''

896
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:36,543
l promise, Grace.

897
00:57:40,552 --> 00:57:42,987
lt's gonna be all right, Grace.

898
00:57:46,954 --> 00:57:51,790
lf it's not too much trouble, can you
please bring my fiance home with you?

899
00:57:51,915 --> 00:57:53,554
Oh, Jesus.

900
00:58:03,479 --> 00:58:04,913
The president will be
addressing the nation...

901
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,951
and all of you personally
within the hour.

902
00:58:33,928 --> 00:58:36,204
Astronauts.

903
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:45,243
l'll see you
in a couple days, honey.

904
00:58:49,933 --> 00:58:53,530
All my bags are packed

905
00:58:53,615 --> 00:58:56,413
l'm ready to go

906
00:58:56,495 --> 00:59:00,729
l'm standing here
outside your door

907
00:59:00,817 --> 00:59:03,615
l hate to wake you up

908
00:59:03,697 --> 00:59:06,053
To say goodbye

909
00:59:06,178 --> 00:59:10,332
So kiss me and smile for me

910
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:13,253
Let me know you'll wait for me

911
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:17,933
Hold me like
you'll never let me go

912
00:59:18,062 --> 00:59:21,099
'Cause l'm leavin'

913
00:59:21,223 --> 00:59:23,532
On a jet plane

914
00:59:23,663 --> 00:59:25,814
Don't know
when l'll be back again

915
00:59:25,904 --> 00:59:30,262
Leavin' on a jet plane

916
00:59:30,385 --> 00:59:33,617
l don't know
when l'll be back again

917
00:59:33,747 --> 00:59:37,137
- Leavin' on a jet plane
- Leavin' on a jet plane

918
00:59:37,267 --> 00:59:40,499
l don't know
when l'll be back again

919
00:59:40,628 --> 00:59:45,545
- Leavin' on a jet plane
- So, Truman, this is who you found
to save the planet.

920
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:47,825
- Don't know when l'll be back again
- Frost, you good to go?

921
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:50,830
-Mm-hmm. One-One sec.
-Leavin' on a jet plane
-That boy don't take anything seriously.

922
00:59:50,912 --> 00:59:54,428
- Yeah. Reminds me of
a guy l used to know.
- Don't know when l'll be back again

923
00:59:54,553 --> 00:59:57,989
Leavin' on a jet plane

924
00:59:58,073 --> 01:00:00,714
- l don't know when l'll be back again
- l'm marrying you.

925
01:00:00,795 --> 01:00:04,834
- Bet your ass you are.
- Leavin' on a jet plane

926
01:00:04,955 --> 01:00:07,517
l don't know
when l'll be back again

927
01:00:22,641 --> 01:00:24,917
l address you tonight...

928
01:00:25,042 --> 01:00:27,955
not as the president
of the United States...

929
01:00:29,483 --> 01:00:31,952
not as the leader of a country...

930
01:00:32,044 --> 01:00:35,481
but as a citizen of humanity.

931
01:00:37,245 --> 01:00:40,762
We are faced with the very gravest
of challenges.

932
01:00:41,927 --> 01:00:46,604
The Bible calls this day Armageddon,
the end of all things.

933
01:00:47,808 --> 01:00:52,008
And yet,
for the first time...

934
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:56,602
in the history of the planet,
a species has the technology...

935
01:00:56,732 --> 01:01:00,042
to prevent its own extinction.

936
01:01:00,172 --> 01:01:03,961
All of you praying with us
need to know...

937
01:01:04,093 --> 01:01:08,134
that everything that can be done
to prevent this disaster...

938
01:01:08,215 --> 01:01:10,649
is being called into service.

939
01:01:12,976 --> 01:01:16,447
The human thirst for excellence...

940
01:01:17,417 --> 01:01:19,886
and knowledge...

941
01:01:20,018 --> 01:01:24,093
every step
up the ladder of science...

942
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:28,093
every adventurous
reach into space...

943
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:32,095
all of our combined
modern technologies and imaginations...

944
01:01:32,182 --> 01:01:35,937
even the wars that we've fought,
have provided us the tools...

945
01:01:36,023 --> 01:01:38,333
to wage this terrible battle.

946
01:01:39,665 --> 01:01:42,020
Through all the chaos
that is our history...

947
01:01:42,105 --> 01:01:44,983
through all of the wrongs
and the discord...

948
01:01:45,105 --> 01:01:46,859
through all of the pain
and suffering...

949
01:01:46,987 --> 01:01:51,504
through all of our times
there is one thing...

950
01:01:51,588 --> 01:01:54,182
- that has nourished our souls...
- Mom, that salesman's on TV.

951
01:01:54,268 --> 01:01:56,864
and elevated our species
above its origins...

952
01:01:56,990 --> 01:01:59,140
and that is our courage.

953
01:01:59,230 --> 01:02:02,348
The dreams of an entire planet
are focused tonight...

954
01:02:02,431 --> 01:02:05,822
on those 14 brave souls...

955
01:02:05,952 --> 01:02:08,023
travelling into the heavens.

956
01:02:08,153 --> 01:02:11,384
That man's not a salesman.
That's your daddy.

957
01:02:11,514 --> 01:02:15,827
And may we all, citizens the world over,
see these events through.

958
01:02:16,955 --> 01:02:20,427
Godspeed and good luck to you.

959
01:02:27,398 --> 01:02:30,119
Freedom crew.
lndependence crew.

960
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:37,953
- How you feelin'?
- Uh, good, you know.

961
01:02:38,082 --> 01:02:42,076
l mean, considering l've never been this
scared in my entire life. l-- You know--

962
01:02:42,163 --> 01:02:45,793
Listen, once you get up there,
you're gonna be on your own.

963
01:02:45,924 --> 01:02:47,756
lf anything should happen,
l just wanted--

964
01:02:47,885 --> 01:02:51,241
l know, Harry. l'll, uh,
try not to disappoint you.

965
01:02:55,087 --> 01:02:57,556
Take care of yourself, kid.

966
01:03:01,849 --> 01:03:04,159
Freedom's on the bridge.

967
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:08,847
Attention in the firing room.
The oxidizer loading is complete.

968
01:03:08,971 --> 01:03:12,203
- lndependence on the bridge.
- Attention all personnel.

969
01:03:12,332 --> 01:03:15,131
We are T minus two hours
to the programme goal.

970
01:03:23,735 --> 01:03:25,647
- Hey, Harry.
- Yeah, Rock?

971
01:03:25,776 --> 01:03:28,894
You know, we're sittin' on four million
pounds of fuel, one nuclear weapon...

972
01:03:29,017 --> 01:03:31,851
and a thing that has
270,000 moving parts...

973
01:03:31,978 --> 01:03:34,094
built by the lowest bidder.

974
01:03:34,218 --> 01:03:38,338
- Makes you feel good, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

975
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:42,769
- How ya doin', Oscar?
- Great.

976
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:45,097
- Yeah?
- l got that excited, scared feelin'--

977
01:03:45,182 --> 01:03:48,175
like 98% excited, 2% scared.

978
01:03:48,263 --> 01:03:52,098
Maybe it's more. lt could be 2-- lt
could be 98% percent scared, 2% excited.

979
01:03:52,224 --> 01:03:57,697
But that's what makes it
so intense, is it's so confused.
l can't really figure it out.

980
01:03:57,825 --> 01:04:00,102
Will you make mine really tight,
'cause l don't want to fall out.

981
01:04:00,227 --> 01:04:03,424
- Yes, sir.
- l mean, almost to the point
of cutting off circulation.

982
01:04:03,547 --> 01:04:06,904
- Ow.
- lt must be a comfort to know...

983
01:04:07,028 --> 01:04:10,466
that if the space programme
goes under you can always get a job
at Helga's House of Pain, huh?

984
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:13,787
- All right. Flight directors on
with the go/no-go for launch.
- Retro.

985
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:15,708
- Go flight.
- Booster.
- Go flight.

986
01:04:15,831 --> 01:04:17,982
- Ecos.
- Go flight.
- Trajectory.
- Go flight.

987
01:04:18,112 --> 01:04:20,627
- FlDO.
- Go flight.
- EVA.
- Go flight.

988
01:04:20,713 --> 01:04:24,103
- CAPCOM Freedom.
- Go flight.
- CAPCOM lndependence.
- Go flight.

989
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:27,471
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
it's pucker time.

990
01:04:27,595 --> 01:04:31,555
lndependence and Freedom,
this is Kennedy firing room.
We're T minus one minute.

991
01:04:31,636 --> 01:04:35,312
All crew members,
close and lock your visors.

992
01:04:35,437 --> 01:04:38,874
lndependence, this is launch control.
Be advised, we're in a smooth count.

993
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:41,871
T minus 31. You're go
for auto-sequence start.

994
01:04:41,999 --> 01:04:44,833
B.L.T.s, perform
your A.D.U. pre-start.

995
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:49,638
Okay, gentlemen, you're our warriors
up there. God be with you.

996
01:04:49,762 --> 01:04:54,154
- You're already heroes.
Just sit back and enjoy the ride.
- F.T.D., we're clear to launch.

997
01:04:54,283 --> 01:04:56,558
We're T minus 20 seconds.

998
01:04:58,804 --> 01:05:02,798
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

999
01:05:04,085 --> 01:05:06,760
four, three, two, one.

1000
01:05:06,847 --> 01:05:09,077
We have main engine start.

1001
01:05:11,048 --> 01:05:14,758
- We have booster ignition.
- We're going.

1002
01:05:14,889 --> 01:05:17,040
And liftoff.

1003
01:05:25,132 --> 01:05:28,330
Freedom, this is flight deck.

1004
01:05:28,413 --> 01:05:30,210
Roger, Freedom.
You're looking good.

1005
01:05:42,697 --> 01:05:47,374
- We have go for lndependence.
- Three, two, one.

1006
01:05:47,458 --> 01:05:51,578
-lndependence, we have booster ignition.
-We have liftoff.

1007
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:54,009
We are cooking, Houston.

1008
01:06:14,707 --> 01:06:17,017
Houston, the tower is clear.
They're all yours.

1009
01:06:20,548 --> 01:06:23,428
- Heads up, everybody. They're ours now.
- All engines are go.

1010
01:06:23,550 --> 01:06:26,622
Keep a sharp eye out on both of 'em.

1011
01:06:32,272 --> 01:06:34,628
Start roll manoeuvre.

1012
01:06:44,276 --> 01:06:47,428
- Two good roll programs.
- One down.
- lndependence, we have a max cue.

1013
01:06:47,517 --> 01:06:49,348
Roger, Control.
We are a max cue.

1014
01:06:51,398 --> 01:06:53,673
S.R.B. sep--

1015
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:00,871
- We are single-engine, press, demi-go.
- Copy, press, demi-go.

1016
01:07:00,961 --> 01:07:03,032
Houston, this is a kick-ass ride!

1017
01:07:09,163 --> 01:07:12,555
Freedom, this is Houston.
Main engine cut out on schedule. Out.

1018
01:07:21,407 --> 01:07:23,524
Freedom, stats are good.

1019
01:07:27,809 --> 01:07:30,802
- lndependence,
telemetry is up and running--
- Oh, my God!

1020
01:07:30,890 --> 01:07:34,406
This is space! 'Course, we're just
in the beginning part of space.

1021
01:07:34,531 --> 01:07:36,887
We-We haven't even gotten
to outer space yet.

1022
01:07:36,972 --> 01:07:40,170
Roger, Houston.
We have a visual on the Russian
space station. lnitiating retro burn.

1023
01:07:42,693 --> 01:07:46,165
Gentlemen, remember the Russian space
station has been up there for 11 years.

1024
01:07:46,295 --> 01:07:48,251
Most of us
don't have cars that old.

1025
01:07:48,335 --> 01:07:52,330
Now, the cosmonaut on board has been
on that tin can for 18 months, alone.

1026
01:07:55,177 --> 01:07:57,487
So don't be surprised
if he's a little off.

1027
01:07:57,578 --> 01:08:01,971
- lndependence, we're gonna put you--
- All right, crew.
Let's exit these flight suits.

1028
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:07,858
Hello. This is Russian
space station. Can you hear me?

1029
01:08:09,262 --> 01:08:11,139
We copy, Russian space station.
This is Houston.

1030
01:08:11,262 --> 01:08:14,573
l'm ready to fire
my thrusters any time.

1031
01:08:14,703 --> 01:08:17,980
- Stand by.
- Okay. l'm not going anywhere.

1032
01:08:18,064 --> 01:08:21,102
We have a go.
lnitiate gravitational spin.

1033
01:08:27,587 --> 01:08:30,580
You are maxed at 40% spin.

1034
01:08:31,988 --> 01:08:34,662
Okay, Houston.

1035
01:08:34,789 --> 01:08:38,988
l can feel l'm having gravity.

1036
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:41,864
All right, gentlemen.
We're gonna dock in a minute.

1037
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:46,070
Now, the Russian space station has
fired her rockets to simulate gravity
and let us work faster.

1038
01:08:46,193 --> 01:08:48,263
But it's gonna make you queasy,
so prepare yourself.

1039
01:08:48,353 --> 01:08:52,587
Well, it's about time.
l haven't thrown up in about an hour.

1040
01:08:55,835 --> 01:08:58,715
lnitiating first phase
of docking procedure.

1041
01:08:58,837 --> 01:09:01,749
- Switching to manual.
- Manual override.

1042
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:11,591
One foot per second.
Let's take this slow and
do it right, folks. Twenty feet.

1043
01:09:14,801 --> 01:09:18,636
Ten feet. Looking good on radar.

1044
01:09:18,722 --> 01:09:21,032
Five feet.

1045
01:09:24,004 --> 01:09:27,475
Locks are engaged.
Fuel teams, let's go.

1046
01:09:28,645 --> 01:09:31,797
Freedom, telemetry is looking good.

1047
01:09:31,887 --> 01:09:36,120
- We have soft dock.
- Fuel teams, prepare to unload.

1048
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:43,407
All right, gentlemen, watch your heads.
Let's go, lndependence.

1049
01:09:46,890 --> 01:09:48,610
Colonel.

1050
01:09:58,094 --> 01:10:01,405
Where is he? Anybody home?

1051
01:10:01,495 --> 01:10:04,090
Welcome, everybody!

1052
01:10:05,777 --> 01:10:09,737
l am not gas station.
This is sophisticated laboratory.

1053
01:10:09,858 --> 01:10:13,568
l'm in charge.
So do not be touching anything.

1054
01:10:13,699 --> 01:10:15,975
l need one-- l need you.

1055
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:18,893
- Go with him.
- l need you. Hurry up.
Hurry up. Come on. Come on.

1056
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:23,459
lt's very important you watch the
fuel gauge, okay? Put on cold suit.

1057
01:10:23,542 --> 01:10:26,535
- Countdown clock will hold at--
- Copy that, Houston.
Prepping for fuel transfer.

1058
01:10:26,623 --> 01:10:29,262
Countdown clock will hold
at T minus 20 minutes and--

1059
01:10:29,343 --> 01:10:33,054
- Fuel pod is down there.
- lt's down here, huh? Great.

1060
01:10:35,225 --> 01:10:38,024
Let's go. Move it on.
Here we go. We go. We go.

1061
01:10:38,106 --> 01:10:40,667
Bring it down. Bring it down.

1062
01:10:43,468 --> 01:10:46,187
Okay, let's connect
these fuel lines.

1063
01:10:47,709 --> 01:10:50,861
Freedom on the left,
lndependence on the right.

1064
01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:53,424
All right. We're goin' left here.

1065
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:59,030
To the right is fuel gauge.
You watch the fuel gauge. 150, okay.

1066
01:10:59,113 --> 01:11:04,268
160, okay. 200, bad disaster
for space station.

1067
01:11:04,354 --> 01:11:09,383
So if you watch 200,
you can call for Lev, on,
and you see here number one, on.

1068
01:11:09,475 --> 01:11:12,116
You ask for Lev. And you pull
this down, all the way down.

1069
01:11:12,197 --> 01:11:16,953
- What's Lev?
- l am Lev Andropov,
colonel of Russian space agency.

1070
01:11:17,038 --> 01:11:20,588
ln Russia l'm a very big man.

1071
01:11:20,679 --> 01:11:23,319
- We're ready to transfer.
- l'm coming. No problem.

1072
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,233
You. You. You there!

1073
01:11:29,602 --> 01:11:32,036
- Hard locked.
- Ready for transfusion!

1074
01:11:40,245 --> 01:11:42,236
Fuel is pumping.

1075
01:11:45,767 --> 01:11:49,886
Hey, Lev, the, uh, the-the pressure's
climbing. ls there a problem here?

1076
01:11:49,968 --> 01:11:52,118
Houston, we're on
fuel transference.

1077
01:11:52,208 --> 01:11:56,283
Don't touch my uncle. You know?
He's a genius of my family.

1078
01:11:57,170 --> 01:12:01,050
Lev! Can anybody hear me?
Guys? Hello, guys.

1079
01:12:01,171 --> 01:12:03,640
He used to work
for a big bomb factory.

1080
01:12:03,732 --> 01:12:07,612
He used to make the tip of the bomb,
the thing that finds, uh...

1081
01:12:07,733 --> 01:12:10,202
New York or Washington, you know?

1082
01:12:10,294 --> 01:12:13,605
- Ooh.
- Check your hoses.
We got some thermal variation.

1083
01:12:13,735 --> 01:12:17,092
Stamper, let's look at the couplings
back on the shuttle.

1084
01:12:18,577 --> 01:12:21,375
Okay. Shut down. Uh--

1085
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:30,892
- Guys!
- Hold on a second.
- What's that noise?

1086
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:35,695
Oh, no! God!

1087
01:12:38,142 --> 01:12:41,772
- What is it?
- Leak! Leak! Leak!

1088
01:12:43,704 --> 01:12:47,664
Get your men
back to the shuttle! Go!

1089
01:12:47,745 --> 01:12:50,863
Go on! Hurry up!
Get out of there!

1090
01:12:50,946 --> 01:12:52,983
Now there's really sparks!

1091
01:12:53,067 --> 01:12:56,947
- Pull lever!
- This is the lever!

1092
01:12:57,028 --> 01:13:00,658
- Colonel, we must get him out of there!
- A.J., come on out!

1093
01:13:04,030 --> 01:13:06,385
Hurry! Hurry!

1094
01:13:08,352 --> 01:13:10,582
Emergency! Break away!

1095
01:13:10,712 --> 01:13:13,466
We got a fire
in the fuel pod!

1096
01:13:15,873 --> 01:13:19,709
- Come on!
- Come on! Get in here!
A.J.'s stuck in the fuel pod!

1097
01:13:21,755 --> 01:13:25,306
- We're losing it!
- Come on out of there!

1098
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:38,514
Control, this is lndependence.
l am seeing vibration--

1099
01:13:39,961 --> 01:13:42,795
- Malloy, talk to me!
- Not good. We got sparks
and fire in the fuel pod.

1100
01:13:42,922 --> 01:13:46,757
- lndependence, blow those locks
and get outta there now!
- Dump the hoses now! We're going!

1101
01:13:46,883 --> 01:13:50,764
- What happened?
Let me shut off the O2 feed!
- Harry, it's burnin' up!

1102
01:13:50,845 --> 01:13:55,123
Damn! Max, Rock, get in here! Get down
there and crack these pipes over here!

1103
01:13:55,245 --> 01:13:59,081
- Harry, no! lt's burnin' up!
- We're goin' back for the other team!

1104
01:13:59,167 --> 01:14:02,478
Switch on the personnel locators.

1105
01:14:02,608 --> 01:14:04,485
Trackin' A.J. He's climbin'.

1106
01:14:04,568 --> 01:14:06,844
- No!
- Go! Go!

1107
01:14:06,969 --> 01:14:11,248
lt's too late! Get back to the shuttle!
This thing's gonna blow!

1108
01:14:11,370 --> 01:14:12,929
No!

1109
01:14:13,051 --> 01:14:18,126
Colonel, we gotta move now!
Come on! You're gonna die!

1110
01:14:18,252 --> 01:14:20,847
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
We got a man in there!
- Open that door and we'll all die!

1111
01:14:20,973 --> 01:14:23,568
- Fuel leak!
- Get out of there!

1112
01:14:25,375 --> 01:14:27,843
Evac now! Let's go! Let's go!

1113
01:14:29,816 --> 01:14:33,332
Come on back!
No, wait! The door is broken!

1114
01:14:34,697 --> 01:14:37,531
- No!
- They got the fire
sealed in the fuel pod.

1115
01:14:37,658 --> 01:14:39,650
- They locked it down.
- Tracking 'em back to the shuttle.

1116
01:14:39,779 --> 01:14:42,817
They've still got two men
trapped in there!

1117
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:47,173
Keep running! The shuttle's another
75 feet! Where's the rest of the team?

1118
01:14:47,301 --> 01:14:50,499
- Let's get out of here! The pod--
- Wait, wait, wait! Where's A.J.?
- A.J.'s gone!

1119
01:14:50,622 --> 01:14:55,572
- We're not leavin' without A.J.!
- He's gone! lt's too late!

1120
01:14:55,663 --> 01:14:58,133
Come on!
This way is our only chance!

1121
01:14:58,225 --> 01:15:00,580
So it's minus 100!

1122
01:15:00,705 --> 01:15:03,743
Very cold. Hold breath,
or lung freezes!

1123
01:15:09,108 --> 01:15:12,943
Get back to the shuttle!
And lock that door!

1124
01:15:13,069 --> 01:15:16,983
- Come on!
- Hurry, A.J.!
- Leave him alone! Leave him alone!

1125
01:15:17,070 --> 01:15:19,949
- l tried! l tried. But A.J.--
- lt's on fire! lt's on fire, Harry!

1126
01:15:20,071 --> 01:15:22,506
- lt's them or all of us!
- lt's on fire!

1127
01:15:22,632 --> 01:15:25,147
- Full thrust.
- We're gonna get hit.

1128
01:15:40,597 --> 01:15:44,910
Lev! Lev, the door's gonna blow!

1129
01:15:45,038 --> 01:15:46,950
No!

1130
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:53,596
We're going! lt's gonna blow!

1131
01:15:53,721 --> 01:15:57,351
- A.J.'s still in there!
- Blow the locks. No, the bolts!

1132
01:15:57,482 --> 01:16:01,635
- We've gotta blow--
- l think we're almost there!

1133
01:16:02,804 --> 01:16:05,478
Flight, lndependence
does not have A.J. They're gonna
close the door without him.

1134
01:16:05,565 --> 01:16:08,637
- Tracking. They're 75 feet
from the shuttle.
- Just tell them to air lock
the door and go!

1135
01:16:08,765 --> 01:16:11,122
- Dog the hatch now!
- Close it!

1136
01:16:16,408 --> 01:16:18,319
Ho--

1137
01:16:18,408 --> 01:16:22,881
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Colonel! That thing's
comin' right for us! We got to move!

1138
01:16:26,611 --> 01:16:29,604
Hurry up!
There's the shuttle door!

1139
01:16:30,692 --> 01:16:34,049
Fire's coming at us!
Close the door now!

1140
01:16:38,095 --> 01:16:40,245
Go! Go! Go!

1141
01:16:47,137 --> 01:16:51,370
Freedom, the lndependence crew
is on board and accounted for.

1142
01:16:51,498 --> 01:16:55,459
- We're even heavy one cosmonaut.
- They got 90% of their fuel.

1143
01:16:56,140 --> 01:17:00,897
-Pretty intense, huh?
-That's why l told you, ''Touch nothing.''

1144
01:17:01,022 --> 01:17:02,853
But you're bunch of cowboys.

1145
01:17:07,063 --> 01:17:09,498
So while the consciousness
of the planet is unified...

1146
01:17:09,584 --> 01:17:13,339
focused on the NASA mission taking place
right now in the vast ocean of space...

1147
01:17:13,425 --> 01:17:16,020
we're now in the final hours
of the mission...

1148
01:17:16,146 --> 01:17:19,264
as the Freedom and lndependence
prepare to slingshot around the moon.

1149
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:32,869
Morning, guys. lt's time to suit up,
l guess. Uh, we got a big day.

1150
01:17:32,951 --> 01:17:36,581
- Eighteen seconds to radio interrupt.
- Booster sequence confirmed.

1151
01:17:36,672 --> 01:17:39,631
This is Houston.
Roger that, Freedom. We copy.

1152
01:17:39,713 --> 01:17:44,072
- Shuttles are ready
for the burn around the moon.
- Radio contact terminated. We're out.

1153
01:17:45,435 --> 01:17:48,632
Nine and a half Gs for 11 minutes.
l'd start praying about right now.

1154
01:17:54,558 --> 01:17:58,598
So this is the part where we're supposed
to just hold on real tight and, uh,
hope we don't die.

1155
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:02,190
- Stand by for lunar roll.
- High inclination. Lunar orbit.

1156
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,869
You boys got those wills
filled out correctly?

1157
01:18:22,246 --> 01:18:25,444
All right, men, this is what
we trained for. Now just suck it up!

1158
01:18:25,567 --> 01:18:27,843
On the mark. Five, four...

1159
01:18:27,968 --> 01:18:30,436
three, two, one.

1160
01:18:40,532 --> 01:18:43,365
- ls this supposed to be like this?
- Don't worry. This is normal.

1161
01:18:43,492 --> 01:18:46,769
- How would you know?
- 14,000 miles an hour.

1162
01:18:46,893 --> 01:18:49,488
- Four Gs.
- How long does this last?

1163
01:18:49,614 --> 01:18:51,446
Six Gs.

1164
01:18:53,455 --> 01:18:56,368
- 15,000.
- Really heavy, man!
- This isn't normal.

1165
01:18:56,496 --> 01:18:59,489
- What do you mean, ''this isn't normal''?
- This is way worse!

1166
01:18:59,577 --> 01:19:02,775
- Eight Gs. Hang tight!
- l'm not gonna make it!

1167
01:19:02,898 --> 01:19:05,413
Oh, we're gonna die!

1168
01:19:05,539 --> 01:19:07,690
Twelve minutes.
Flight, we still got nothin' here.

1169
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:11,451
This is too fast!

1170
01:19:15,582 --> 01:19:17,733
Ten Gs!

1171
01:19:29,146 --> 01:19:33,902
We're maxed at 22,500!

1172
01:19:42,430 --> 01:19:45,787
We have acquisition of signal
from lndependence and Freedom.

1173
01:19:45,911 --> 01:19:48,710
We're in, guys.
All right. Welcome back, team.

1174
01:19:48,832 --> 01:19:50,983
We have visual
of the target, Houston.

1175
01:19:59,715 --> 01:20:01,946
You see that?

1176
01:20:06,037 --> 01:20:08,108
Wow.

1177
01:20:09,998 --> 01:20:13,356
- Come in, lndependence.
- Houston, you gotta see this
to believe it.

1178
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:19,717
Okay, team, let's take 'em in. Okay,
Quincy, how much tail debris do we have?

1179
01:20:19,842 --> 01:20:21,878
Freedom, turn on your FOD radar.

1180
01:20:21,962 --> 01:20:24,431
FOD radar on.

1181
01:20:25,563 --> 01:20:29,000
Everybody, hang on. This could get
a little rough. Engaging evasive radar.

1182
01:20:36,847 --> 01:20:38,724
Hold on!

1183
01:20:49,090 --> 01:20:50,682
Goddam! We got debris!

1184
01:20:52,651 --> 01:20:54,449
We're dumping auxiliary boosters.

1185
01:21:07,775 --> 01:21:10,245
- Houston, do you read me?
- We got debris!

1186
01:21:13,017 --> 01:21:15,771
- We're goin' in!
- We're comin' in hot!

1187
01:21:18,779 --> 01:21:21,419
lndependence, try to maintain
your present heading.
You've got a target L.Z.

1188
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:24,492
- There's too much debris!
We gotta peel off!
- Negative!

1189
01:21:28,062 --> 01:21:29,893
We're hit!

1190
01:21:31,943 --> 01:21:34,777
- Mayday, mayday!
- l've lost main thrusters.
Get 'em back up!

1191
01:21:34,904 --> 01:21:37,135
Mayday, Houston, mayday!
We've lost R.C.S. thrusters!

1192
01:21:37,265 --> 01:21:40,940
Mayday, Freedom, mayday! We are
out of control! We are going down!

1193
01:21:41,025 --> 01:21:43,461
Do you read me?
Freedom, we are going down!

1194
01:21:56,070 --> 01:21:58,140
We're gonna hit!

1195
01:22:07,153 --> 01:22:11,546
Everybody, go to your own life support!
Lock yourself in the cargo bay!

1196
01:22:13,435 --> 01:22:18,272
We are going down! Houston! Houston,
we are going down! We have lost control!

1197
01:22:18,357 --> 01:22:20,428
l can't get it on!

1198
01:22:21,798 --> 01:22:24,996
- Good luck, Freedom.
- Oh, my God, this is it.

1199
01:22:33,522 --> 01:22:35,672
No! No!

1200
01:22:41,284 --> 01:22:44,960
Pull it! Pull it! Go!

1201
01:23:13,893 --> 01:23:16,967
Sharp, what the hell is that?
ls that the lndependence?

1202
01:23:21,696 --> 01:23:25,053
Houston, lndependence is a dead stick.
They're not gonna make it.

1203
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:39,851
Houston, lndependence has gone down.

1204
01:23:51,385 --> 01:23:53,694
When l touch this baby down,
full reverse thrust.

1205
01:23:53,825 --> 01:23:56,739
- Fires on your right, Sharp!
- Reversing the thrusters!

1206
01:23:57,827 --> 01:24:00,262
Hang tight! Hang tight!

1207
01:24:00,388 --> 01:24:05,703
- Houston, we overshot our landing field
We overshot our landing field.
- Oh, no!

1208
01:24:25,115 --> 01:24:27,390
God!

1209
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:45,670
lnitiate system light system check. Make
sure we can still get off this rock.

1210
01:24:45,802 --> 01:24:49,238
Our electrical system is screwed.
l'm going to back-up. Fuel seals check.

1211
01:24:49,362 --> 01:24:53,197
- Engine seals check.
Pressure seals check.
- Oh, God. Oh!

1212
01:24:55,485 --> 01:24:57,396
Anyone hurt?

1213
01:24:58,845 --> 01:25:04,365
Where's-- Where's the other shuttle?
What happened to the other shuttle?

1214
01:25:04,447 --> 01:25:07,440
- lndependence is off the grid.
- ''Off the grid''?

1215
01:25:07,528 --> 01:25:10,885
What are you, a freakin' cyborg?
What does that mean?

1216
01:25:11,009 --> 01:25:14,685
Hey, you saw it yourself, right?
They're gone.

1217
01:25:16,130 --> 01:25:19,647
Come in, Freedom. This is
CAPCOM Houston. Freedom, come in.

1218
01:25:19,772 --> 01:25:23,448
This is CAPCOM Houston.
Come in, Freedom.

1219
01:25:23,573 --> 01:25:26,371
- God!
- Let's just ask God
to take care of our friends.

1220
01:25:28,334 --> 01:25:30,405
May they rest in peace.

1221
01:25:32,095 --> 01:25:34,291
Amen.

1222
01:25:40,618 --> 01:25:43,337
We got eight hours.

1223
01:25:43,458 --> 01:25:46,657
Let's get this job done
and go home.

1224
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:50,774
Nothin'. Come on, Watts,
Sharp, somebody.

1225
01:25:50,861 --> 01:25:53,581
This is CAPCOM Houston.

1226
01:25:53,702 --> 01:25:59,221
Come in, Freedom. Freedom, come in.
This is CAPCOM Houston.

1227
01:25:59,343 --> 01:26:01,539
- Maybe you shouldn't be here.
- Come in, Freedom.

1228
01:26:01,664 --> 01:26:05,578
- l don't have anywhere else to go.
- Freedom, come in.
This is CAPCOM Houston.

1229
01:26:07,666 --> 01:26:10,340
All right, let's get the tools unpacked
and fire up the Armadillo.

1230
01:26:10,427 --> 01:26:13,420
- We're not getting a damn thing
on the inertial nav system.
- l know where we are.

1231
01:26:13,548 --> 01:26:16,426
Please step away.
Radio signal's dead.

1232
01:26:16,548 --> 01:26:20,304
l'm flipping the backup generator.
Radio signal's gonna be cut in half
till we get main power back.

1233
01:26:20,430 --> 01:26:25,711
We're in segment 202, lateral grid 9,
site 15H-32, give or take a few yards.

1234
01:26:25,832 --> 01:26:28,949
Captain America here
blew the landing by 26 miles.

1235
01:26:29,072 --> 01:26:33,112
- How the hell do you know that?
- Because l'm a genius.

1236
01:26:33,233 --> 01:26:36,671
The gauges will not read.
They're all peaked, like we're
plugged into some magnetic field.

1237
01:26:36,795 --> 01:26:39,468
- Well, who on this spaceship
wants to know why?
- By all means.

1238
01:26:39,555 --> 01:26:42,435
The reason we were shooting for grid 8
was because thermographics indicated...

1239
01:26:42,557 --> 01:26:44,707
that grid 9
was compressed iron ferrite.

1240
01:26:46,077 --> 01:26:48,831
Which means you landed us
on a goddam iron plate.

1241
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:55,478
All right. Well, you heard the man.
Let's wheel out the remote satellite
link. We need that radio.

1242
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:58,479
Oh, God, please tell me
we still got one of 'em.

1243
01:27:00,162 --> 01:27:02,630
lndependence has flat-lined.

1244
01:27:44,815 --> 01:27:46,726
Oscar! Oscar!

1245
01:27:49,457 --> 01:27:51,732
Oh, God!

1246
01:27:54,258 --> 01:27:56,135
Hello! Anyone!

1247
01:27:56,218 --> 01:28:00,611
ls anyone else alive?
Somebody help me!

1248
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:05,009
A.J.!

1249
01:28:05,142 --> 01:28:08,214
- Where are you?
- l'm here.

1250
01:28:12,463 --> 01:28:16,697
Lev, there's no one else.
There's no one else.

1251
01:28:16,825 --> 01:28:20,580
- l know.
- Oh, man.

1252
01:28:20,666 --> 01:28:23,500
- Bear, where are you?
- A.J.! A.J.!

1253
01:28:25,067 --> 01:28:27,980
l'm in the shuttle, man.

1254
01:28:28,108 --> 01:28:30,145
Are you all right?

1255
01:28:30,269 --> 01:28:32,465
l'm so glad to see you, man.

1256
01:28:32,590 --> 01:28:35,662
l never thought l'd be so happy
to see your ugly face.

1257
01:28:35,870 --> 01:28:39,342
- Houston, do you read? This is Freedom.
- Check your thrusters.

1258
01:28:39,472 --> 01:28:43,546
- Houston, do you copy?
- ls everyone good to go?

1259
01:28:53,155 --> 01:28:54,954
Wow.

1260
01:29:04,559 --> 01:29:07,870
Down here! ln the valley!

1261
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,561
This place is like
Dr Seuss's worst nightmare.

1262
01:29:10,681 --> 01:29:15,392
Let's get the remote satellite.
We'll get better reception up there.

1263
01:29:15,522 --> 01:29:20,154
Bring Max down.
Watch yourself through here, Max.
There's a couple big fissures.

1264
01:29:20,284 --> 01:29:22,879
To the left!
Bring it to the left!

1265
01:29:28,367 --> 01:29:32,646
Rockhound, you come on down here
and take some readings
down in the flat spot.

1266
01:29:34,568 --> 01:29:36,445
lron ferrite.

1267
01:29:38,890 --> 01:29:43,168
- l have fire.
- Watts, l'm comin' back. Stand by.

1268
01:29:43,250 --> 01:29:47,040
- Mostly iron, Rockhound.
- God, l hate knowing everything.

1269
01:29:47,172 --> 01:29:49,971
We couldn't have picked
a worse spot to drill.

1270
01:29:50,093 --> 01:29:54,007
Well, l can pretty much guarantee
it's not gonna be thicker than 50 feet.

1271
01:29:54,134 --> 01:29:56,808
- How do you figure that?
- 'Cause if it is, we're screwed.

1272
01:29:59,095 --> 01:30:01,565
- Max, you good?
- Yeah. Just makin' hole.

1273
01:30:01,657 --> 01:30:04,694
- Turn it around.
- Friggin' outer space.

1274
01:30:07,578 --> 01:30:09,934
lt's good.

1275
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:18,892
All right. We're in.
Bring another light.
We're cuttin' through pretty good.

1276
01:30:18,982 --> 01:30:22,259
There's some stuff in here
l ain't never seen.

1277
01:30:22,343 --> 01:30:25,779
All right, let's punch it down!

1278
01:30:25,903 --> 01:30:28,703
- Hey, Harry, did you see that?
- Yeah, Max, l see it. l see it.
What is it?

1279
01:30:28,825 --> 01:30:32,022
- We lost the bite in the bit.
- All right. Back it off. Back it off.

1280
01:30:32,145 --> 01:30:35,617
- Goddam it!
- Sounds like we twisted a shank.
Back it out of there, Max.

1281
01:30:35,747 --> 01:30:37,624
Good. Good. Hold 'er there.

1282
01:30:41,828 --> 01:30:44,503
Wow, this is
a goddam Greek tragedy.

1283
01:30:44,590 --> 01:30:48,503
- We've all seen
broken drill heads before.
- Not after ten feet.

1284
01:30:48,590 --> 01:30:51,425
- l never seen one.
- Well, now you've seen one.

1285
01:30:51,552 --> 01:30:53,827
- What do you want?
- Unpack the Judge.

1286
01:30:56,433 --> 01:30:58,742
Bear, Lev.

1287
01:30:58,833 --> 01:31:02,271
We're only three
astronauts left now.

1288
01:31:02,395 --> 01:31:05,944
We're not astronauts.
We're oil drillers.
We're not even supposed to be here.

1289
01:31:06,035 --> 01:31:08,392
What? You're not astronaut?

1290
01:31:08,517 --> 01:31:10,712
l'm getting us outta here. Get in.

1291
01:31:10,797 --> 01:31:13,756
- Why?
- Just get in the Armadillo.
l have an idea.

1292
01:31:13,838 --> 01:31:18,038
Houston, this is Freedom. Do you copy?
Houston, do you copy?
Freedom shuttle has--

1293
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:22,589
We're gettin' some scattered video feeds
here so we're gonna have to lead over.

1294
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:25,242
Houston, this is Freedom.
Do you copy?

1295
01:31:25,362 --> 01:31:28,513
- Thank God we have you, Freedom.
- Freedom, this is Houston. Go ahead.
- Don't lose 'em, Malloy.

1296
01:31:28,643 --> 01:31:31,874
Sir, we're getting something. Houston,
this is Freedom. We have landed safely.

1297
01:31:32,003 --> 01:31:35,202
- We are at site coordinates
approximately 15H-32--
- Where are they?

1298
01:31:35,285 --> 01:31:38,118
- Okay, l want to know everything
we can about that location.
- Got it.
- Get it before we lose 'em.

1299
01:31:38,205 --> 01:31:41,643
- We're also having electric
and antenna difficulties.
- Walter, get Mechanical on that.

1300
01:31:41,767 --> 01:31:45,363
- But we have commenced drilling.
- Stevens, we're losin' him.
Bring it up on four.

1301
01:31:45,488 --> 01:31:49,083
- Come on.
- On four.
- Shuttle flight capability
not yet known.

1302
01:31:49,208 --> 01:31:51,405
- Bump the signal.
- Bumping.
- Houston. Houston.

1303
01:31:51,490 --> 01:31:53,879
We lost 'em. Get 'em back.
Gruber, we need that hook-up.

1304
01:31:56,411 --> 01:31:59,210
l'll show you how we do things
where l come from.

1305
01:32:06,214 --> 01:32:09,013
Hold on!

1306
01:32:16,977 --> 01:32:18,889
Seat it.

1307
01:32:18,978 --> 01:32:21,173
All right, get ready.
Max, thread it.

1308
01:32:22,819 --> 01:32:25,778
Guys, the clock is tickin'.
Let's go, go, go, go, go!

1309
01:32:25,860 --> 01:32:28,135
All right! Good!
Crank it loose!

1310
01:32:28,260 --> 01:32:31,060
Keep it at 25. Let's kick
a little asteroid butt!

1311
01:32:31,142 --> 01:32:34,532
All right, Chick. Give me
more torque on the turbine, huh?

1312
01:32:34,662 --> 01:32:36,699
- Max, l need some more power down here!
- All right, boss.

1313
01:32:36,783 --> 01:32:39,856
-Throw it forward, then drop the hammer.
-Let's drill through this turd.

1314
01:32:39,944 --> 01:32:42,584
Come on, boys. We gotta hop.
We're fallin' behind.

1315
01:32:42,665 --> 01:32:45,498
Dig, dig, dig.
Chew this iron bitch up.

1316
01:32:50,187 --> 01:32:52,065
- Chick, the tranny is stuck.
- Harry!

1317
01:32:52,148 --> 01:32:55,060
- What is it?
- Chick, come on! Help!

1318
01:32:55,148 --> 01:32:56,980
- Release the clutch!
- Pull it up!

1319
01:32:57,069 --> 01:33:00,028
Okay. Well, this thing's
not movin'.

1320
01:33:00,110 --> 01:33:02,624
No, no, no!
Shut it down! Shut it--

1321
01:33:09,673 --> 01:33:11,709
This is not workin' out, Harry.

1322
01:33:11,793 --> 01:33:16,869
- Oh, are you all right?
- Oh, blew the tranny. Blew the tranny.

1323
01:33:16,995 --> 01:33:19,635
Come on, God.

1324
01:33:19,756 --> 01:33:23,306
Just a little help.
That's all l'm askin'.

1325
01:33:23,437 --> 01:33:26,635
l think we're close enough.
He might've heard ya.

1326
01:33:28,838 --> 01:33:31,513
Here's the bad news.
Before the asteroid passed the moon...

1327
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:34,677
her rotation was stable
at 32 degrees on an X axis.

1328
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:38,795
But now look at this.
The lunar gravity's put her in a spin.

1329
01:33:38,882 --> 01:33:42,193
She's tumbling on all three axes.
This wasn't expected, sir.

1330
01:33:42,323 --> 01:33:44,678
- What does this do for communications?
- Not good.

1331
01:33:44,763 --> 01:33:48,917
We'll have definite contact with the
shuttle for only seven more minutes.
After that, it's radio darkness.

1332
01:33:49,045 --> 01:33:53,995
- For how long?
- And after seven minutes,
we may never hear from them again.

1333
01:33:54,127 --> 01:33:57,836
But we're trying to bounce a signal off
a Russian military satellite,
reestablish contact that way.

1334
01:33:57,927 --> 01:34:02,126
lf we lose the shuttle com,
when do we lose the ability
to remote detonate that nuke?

1335
01:34:02,208 --> 01:34:04,678
The weapon remote receives
a signal from a Milstar satellite.

1336
01:34:04,770 --> 01:34:06,806
Higher orbit,
more powerful transmitter.

1337
01:34:06,930 --> 01:34:10,925
lf we've got the shuttle
for seven minutes, we can remote
detonate for an additional five.

1338
01:34:11,012 --> 01:34:14,163
What he's trying to say, General,
is that, uh, in 12 minutes' time
you may lose the ability...

1339
01:34:14,252 --> 01:34:16,687
to detonate the nuke permanently.

1340
01:34:16,773 --> 01:34:18,650
l've got to inform
the president.

1341
01:34:20,134 --> 01:34:23,810
Just want to make sure you know
we're stuck on an asteroid.
Do you know what you're doing now?

1342
01:34:23,935 --> 01:34:27,612
No, no. You know what? l have no idea
what l'm doing. l have no idea.

1343
01:34:27,737 --> 01:34:30,012
This button-- l don't know
what that does, okay?

1344
01:34:30,137 --> 01:34:35,292
All l know is that we just crashed
back there, l lost two of my friends,
we're 25 miles from Harry's shuttle.

1345
01:34:35,378 --> 01:34:37,814
We don't know if he's alive.
We don't know if he can fly.

1346
01:34:37,900 --> 01:34:42,132
All l know is there's a beep on this
thing and l'm trying to get us there.

1347
01:34:48,943 --> 01:34:52,060
Let's get it unpacked.

1348
01:34:52,143 --> 01:34:55,660
- What's up?
- We're drilling through some kind
of metal l've never seen before.

1349
01:34:55,785 --> 01:34:58,697
lt's fried two of our drill bits,
and now we blew our first transmission.

1350
01:34:58,825 --> 01:35:01,625
- So how deep are we?
- We could use your help
with the transmission, Colonel.

1351
01:35:01,747 --> 01:35:06,060
l have an assessment report due now.
We're supposed to be at 200 feet.
So how deep are we?

1352
01:35:06,188 --> 01:35:09,738
Not as deep as we'll be when
you quit askin' me all these questions
and help us load this transmission on.

1353
01:35:09,869 --> 01:35:13,067
- What is our current depth?
- Our current depth
is not important, Colonel.

1354
01:35:13,190 --> 01:35:18,505
l'll decide what's important.
We've got 800 feet to drill. You've had
two and a half hours. Where are we?

1355
01:35:20,752 --> 01:35:26,192
We're at 57 feet. Now,
if you're not too busy, maybe you can
give us a hand with this transmission.

1356
01:35:26,314 --> 01:35:31,309
Colonel Sharp! Get this wrapped up.
l'll be right back. Colonel Sharp!

1357
01:35:31,395 --> 01:35:34,548
All right. l'm coming through.
We have contact. Over.

1358
01:35:34,677 --> 01:35:39,513
- That's as clear as it's gonna get.
- Houston, this is Freedom. Do you copy?

1359
01:35:39,638 --> 01:35:43,599
Working at a remote satellite link
at this moment. Transmission change.

1360
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:46,194
- Colonel!
- Twenty minutes.
Puts drilling final at ten hours.

1361
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:49,916
Please advise. That's four hours past
the zero barrier. Please advise.

1362
01:35:50,041 --> 01:35:52,795
What the hell is this?
''Zero depth''?

1363
01:35:52,922 --> 01:35:55,391
And where'd this come from?
Who are you talkin' to? ls that Truman?

1364
01:35:55,523 --> 01:35:59,756
Let me have that phone.
Gimme the phone. Truman! Look,
this is what happens when you drill.

1365
01:35:59,844 --> 01:36:05,317
We cannot use your ''U.S. Air Force
Personnel Only'' drill time card.
Who wrote this thing, by the way?

1366
01:36:05,445 --> 01:36:08,803
- We're losing coms again.
- Look-- ls he getting this? Does he
hear me or-- What's wrong with this?

1367
01:36:08,927 --> 01:36:10,758
- The com's down.
- What do you mean, ''the com's down''?

1368
01:36:10,887 --> 01:36:15,485
- What do l mean? l mean we've
lost communication to mission control.
- Fine. Let's go back to the cargo bay
and get the transmission--

1369
01:36:15,609 --> 01:36:19,489
Hey, Harry, guess what.
You had your shot. You didn't do it.
You understand me? You can't--

1370
01:36:19,610 --> 01:36:24,208
Why don't you stay here and take you
and take your little drill card--
Write a report, why don't ya?

1371
01:36:24,332 --> 01:36:29,043
That'll be a-- My men and l
will go and get this hole dug!

1372
01:36:29,133 --> 01:36:32,763
You and your men are the biggest
mistake in the history of NASA.

1373
01:36:35,215 --> 01:36:37,888
- We've lost communication.
- Oh, God.

1374
01:36:40,497 --> 01:36:43,455
We're not lookin'
too good right now.

1375
01:36:43,537 --> 01:36:47,326
No shit.
We gotta get that radio back up.

1376
01:36:49,499 --> 01:36:52,458
Mr President,
it's time to make a decision.

1377
01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:56,773
We can remote detonate the bomb
for only another five minutes.

1378
01:36:58,582 --> 01:37:02,371
Yes? Kimsey here.
Yes, Mr President.

1379
01:37:02,503 --> 01:37:05,017
Yes, we saw that too, sir.

1380
01:37:05,144 --> 01:37:08,023
But maybe we should wait
until they--

1381
01:37:13,947 --> 01:37:18,703
Dan, get them out of there.
Evac right now.

1382
01:37:18,788 --> 01:37:21,781
- What's goin' on here?
- l've been ordered
to override the system.

1383
01:37:26,430 --> 01:37:28,706
Well, what is this?

1384
01:37:32,712 --> 01:37:35,227
Secondary protocol.

1385
01:37:40,315 --> 01:37:43,785
But they haven't drilled
the damn hole yet!

1386
01:37:47,037 --> 01:37:50,872
The president's advisors feel that
the drilling isn't working. And we've
lost radio contact, maybe for good.

1387
01:37:50,958 --> 01:37:54,234
We've only got a few minutes
left of guaranteed ability
to remote detonate that nuke.

1388
01:37:54,318 --> 01:37:56,675
lf we don't do it now we could lose
control, and we may never get it back.

1389
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:59,519
Well, you tell the president that
he better fire his so-called advisors.

1390
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:03,111
And if you detonate
that nuke on the surface,
we waste a perfectly good bomb...

1391
01:38:03,241 --> 01:38:06,040
and we have one chance
to save this planet!

1392
01:38:15,445 --> 01:38:17,401
l need that radio.

1393
01:38:17,485 --> 01:38:20,559
-Gruber, give me everything you got now!
-Roger that.

1394
01:38:24,048 --> 01:38:27,404
Yes, Mr President,
l understand that completely,
but my point is very, very simple.

1395
01:38:27,528 --> 01:38:30,283
And l think you need to trust me on
this because l know something about it.

1396
01:38:30,410 --> 01:38:32,924
l guarantee you, if you do this,
you kill us all.

1397
01:38:36,532 --> 01:38:38,602
Yes, sir.

1398
01:38:38,732 --> 01:38:40,963
General, he wants you.

1399
01:38:43,213 --> 01:38:46,287
This is Kimsey. Yes, sir.

1400
01:38:46,415 --> 01:38:48,326
l understand.

1401
01:38:50,375 --> 01:38:54,131
The orders are
to remote detonate in 30 seconds.

1402
01:38:54,257 --> 01:38:56,691
You have not told them yet!

1403
01:38:56,817 --> 01:38:59,127
That is my father up there!

1404
01:38:59,258 --> 01:39:02,410
- This is one order you shouldn't
follow, and you fucking know it!
- No! Don't touch me!

1405
01:39:02,539 --> 01:39:05,134
Let her go. Let her go!

1406
01:39:07,340 --> 01:39:09,902
Your key, sir.

1407
01:39:13,582 --> 01:39:16,222
God be with them.

1408
01:39:16,343 --> 01:39:19,256
Slow it down.

1409
01:39:24,105 --> 01:39:25,983
Harry...

1410
01:39:26,106 --> 01:39:29,816
the clock on that nine-foot
nuclear weapon is ticking.

1411
01:39:31,028 --> 01:39:35,420
Oh, my God! Sharp!
Get back here now!

1412
01:39:35,549 --> 01:39:37,586
Watts, get the shuttle
ready to evac now!

1413
01:39:37,670 --> 01:39:40,423
- lt just came on all by itself.
What-- What the hell's happening?
- Secondary protocol.

1414
01:39:40,550 --> 01:39:43,066
- What's that? What?
- Wait a minute.
- Secondary protocol.
- What does that mean?

1415
01:39:43,152 --> 01:39:45,461
- What the hell's secondary protocol?
- They're detonating this thing
from Earth.

1416
01:39:45,552 --> 01:39:47,430
- What do you mean, detonating? We
haven't even drilled the hole yet!
- We'll drop it in the hole.

1417
01:39:47,553 --> 01:39:51,023
- What're you talkin' about?
- The hole? Whoa, whoa!
- Get your helmets on now!
- Oh, no, no. How-How you turn it off?

1418
01:39:51,113 --> 01:39:55,074
- Colonel Sharp,
l got two men out on that rock!
- l got a man out there too.
We gotta evac now!

1419
01:39:55,155 --> 01:39:58,432
- Max, Rockhound, get back
to the shuttle, double-time!
- They could be on their way here.

1420
01:39:58,516 --> 01:40:02,476
They're not on their way here.
They would've talked to us by now.
We would've seen them.

1421
01:40:02,597 --> 01:40:05,590
- Watts, air lock the cockpit now!
- l copy you.

1422
01:40:05,678 --> 01:40:10,276
- Max, Rockhound!
- Hey, wait a minute!
How do you turn this thing off?
- Max, Rockhound--

1423
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:12,191
- Harry, do you copy?
- Somethin's wrong.

1424
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:16,912
- Yeah, it's all wrong, man.
We shouldn't even be up here.
- l know. Let's go back to the ship!

1425
01:40:18,202 --> 01:40:22,481
- l'm not leavin' without my men, Sharp.
- We've got two and a half minutes to
drop it and get off this rock.

1426
01:40:22,603 --> 01:40:24,959
lf they're not back by the time
we finish, we leave without 'em.

1427
01:40:25,044 --> 01:40:27,354
Okay, let's simplify this.
Let's just turn the bomb off right now.

1428
01:40:27,445 --> 01:40:30,005
lf we don't put this bomb down in
a hole 800 feet onto a fault line...

1429
01:40:30,125 --> 01:40:32,356
all you're gonna have
is a real expensive fireworks show.

1430
01:40:32,446 --> 01:40:34,881
This is turnin' into
a surrealistic nightmare here.

1431
01:40:34,967 --> 01:40:37,277
Watsler, are you listening?
lt's Truman.

1432
01:40:37,368 --> 01:40:41,157
Okay, listen to me carefully.
l want you to kill it. Kill the uplink.

1433
01:40:52,212 --> 01:40:55,410
- Give us the time, Sharp.
Shut this bomb down now!
- lt's not my call.

1434
01:40:55,493 --> 01:40:58,372
- Then whose call is it?
- Who made it?
- An order to detonate can only
come from the president.

1435
01:40:58,494 --> 01:41:00,565
- The president's not here!
You've gotta give us more time!
- Let's just turn it off now.

1436
01:41:00,695 --> 01:41:03,528
- l'm telling you
to shut this bomb down now!
- And l'm telling you it's not my call!

1437
01:41:03,615 --> 01:41:06,973
- Well, guess what.
l just made the call for you.
- Harry!

1438
01:41:09,057 --> 01:41:11,936
Don't. You could set it off.

1439
01:41:12,058 --> 01:41:15,529
Oh, man. What're you doin'
with a gun in space?

1440
01:41:18,460 --> 01:41:23,058
Come on. Come on. We gotta stop that
bomb right now. Kill the uplink.

1441
01:41:23,142 --> 01:41:28,217
- This thing is gonna blow.
We gotta get it off the ship.
- Easy.

1442
01:41:28,303 --> 01:41:33,459
- Stand down, Sergeant.
- Shut this bomb down and let us
finish our job the right way.

1443
01:41:33,545 --> 01:41:36,105
l'm under orders to protect
a surface detonation.

1444
01:41:36,225 --> 01:41:40,857
l'm gonna give you three seconds
to shut this bomb down,
and then l'm gonna make you shoot me.

1445
01:41:40,947 --> 01:41:43,781
Hurry, Watsler.
For Christ's sake, hurry.

1446
01:41:47,188 --> 01:41:49,181
What happened?

1447
01:41:52,870 --> 01:41:57,070
Sir, the override--
lt's been overridden.

1448
01:41:57,192 --> 01:42:01,186
l've bought us a couple
of minutes, so get that radio
workin', okay? Hurry, hurry!

1449
01:42:03,073 --> 01:42:07,432
Bring me all the way up here just to
blow me and my friends up? ls that it?

1450
01:42:07,555 --> 01:42:09,352
- Listen--
- Shut up!

1451
01:42:09,435 --> 01:42:12,986
Shut up, Colonel.
l'm talking now.

1452
01:42:13,077 --> 01:42:17,356
lt could start again.
lt might've been a warning.

1453
01:42:17,478 --> 01:42:20,436
- Uh-oh.
- That's why you are gonna
dismantle this bomb.

1454
01:42:20,558 --> 01:42:23,313
All right. What'd we miss?

1455
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:30,718
- Do it again.
- Go.

1456
01:42:33,523 --> 01:42:35,241
Keep tryin'.

1457
01:42:36,603 --> 01:42:41,121
Sir, l need you to cease and desist.
l need your terminal now.

1458
01:42:43,845 --> 01:42:47,044
- Oh, they're reactivating the bomb.
- Comin' back on-line, sir.

1459
01:42:47,167 --> 01:42:49,840
Oh, geez. Here we go again.

1460
01:42:49,968 --> 01:42:53,085
What're you doin' up here? And why
did you even bother to make the trip?

1461
01:42:53,208 --> 01:42:55,963
To do the right thing,
to see that it's done.

1462
01:43:03,572 --> 01:43:06,211
For God's sakes,
think about what you're doin'.

1463
01:43:06,332 --> 01:43:09,643
Why are you listenin' to someone
that's 100,000 miles away?

1464
01:43:09,733 --> 01:43:13,205
We're here.
Nobody down there can help us.

1465
01:43:13,295 --> 01:43:16,765
So if we don't get this job done,
then everybody's gone.

1466
01:43:16,895 --> 01:43:19,331
One minute.

1467
01:43:19,457 --> 01:43:22,051
l've been drillin' holes
in the Earth for 30 years.

1468
01:43:22,177 --> 01:43:26,729
And l have never, never missed
a depth that l have aimed for.

1469
01:43:26,858 --> 01:43:29,897
And by God, l am not gonna miss
this one. l will make 800 feet.

1470
01:43:30,020 --> 01:43:33,012
42 seconds.

1471
01:43:33,100 --> 01:43:36,094
But l can't do it alone, Colonel.
l need your help.

1472
01:43:36,182 --> 01:43:39,458
You swear on your daughter's life,
on my family's...

1473
01:43:39,542 --> 01:43:42,057
that you can hit that mark?

1474
01:43:42,183 --> 01:43:46,098
l will make 800 feet.
l swear to God, l will.

1475
01:43:46,225 --> 01:43:49,058
Then let's turn this bomb off.

1476
01:43:59,948 --> 01:44:03,545
Steady. Steady.
Take it back. That's what you'll
have to do. Get 'em off backwards.

1477
01:44:03,670 --> 01:44:06,582
- Rainbow track? Under--
Under one? Under-- Okay.
- All of 'em. All of 'em. All of 'em!

1478
01:44:06,710 --> 01:44:10,307
- Okay. Okay. Are we free of static?
- Oh, do a good job. Do a good job.

1479
01:44:10,392 --> 01:44:14,022
- Steady. Steady.
- Good job. All right.
All right. All right.
- Go! Go! Go!

1480
01:44:14,153 --> 01:44:18,033
Red wire ''A.'' Ready? And-- Now.
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!

1481
01:44:19,275 --> 01:44:23,109
- Negative ''B.'' Ready, and now.
- Do a good job. Do a good job.

1482
01:44:23,195 --> 01:44:25,427
- Track flipped. Hots in.
- lt better be. Go.

1483
01:44:25,557 --> 01:44:27,275
Red or blue?

1484
01:44:29,037 --> 01:44:30,869
Wait--

1485
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:37,549
Blue.

1486
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:42,878
- Good job!
- You got it.

1487
01:44:45,562 --> 01:44:48,714
Oh, God, it sucks up here.

1488
01:44:48,803 --> 01:44:52,957
- Sir, the clock has stopped
at three seconds.
- What?

1489
01:44:53,165 --> 01:44:55,201
Have we lost
complete radio contact?

1490
01:44:55,285 --> 01:44:58,723
l got some magic happening.
We're bouncing off Russian and French
satellites. lt may have a faint signal.

1491
01:44:58,847 --> 01:45:01,486
Houston? Houston, do you copy?

1492
01:45:02,968 --> 01:45:05,198
Go ahead, Freedom.

1493
01:45:05,328 --> 01:45:08,287
Houston, you have a problem--
Problem.

1494
01:45:08,370 --> 01:45:12,158
See, l promised my little girl
that l'd be comin' home.

1495
01:45:12,250 --> 01:45:14,890
Now, l don't know what you
people are doin' down there...

1496
01:45:14,971 --> 01:45:17,725
but we got a hole
to dig up here.

1497
01:45:17,812 --> 01:45:20,532
Go, go, go, go! Come on.
We got work to do.

1498
01:45:20,653 --> 01:45:23,691
Okay, guys. All go, no quit.
How ya doin' down there? Good?

1499
01:45:23,814 --> 01:45:26,568
Okay, got the tranny.
We're back in business.

1500
01:45:26,655 --> 01:45:29,931
Hey, you guys should take a break
and come up and see this.

1501
01:45:31,576 --> 01:45:34,250
Wow. Got a great view
of the Earth from here.

1502
01:45:34,337 --> 01:45:36,488
Too bad we'll never
set foot on her again.

1503
01:45:36,578 --> 01:45:38,694
- Lev, do you see anything?
- No.

1504
01:45:38,778 --> 01:45:40,656
Well, keep goin'.
l'm not givin' up.

1505
01:45:41,820 --> 01:45:43,856
Hold up here, Bear.

1506
01:45:43,980 --> 01:45:46,016
- Oh, boy.
- This is great.

1507
01:45:46,140 --> 01:45:48,861
We just happen to run into
the Grand Canyon on the asteroid?

1508
01:45:48,982 --> 01:45:52,133
l told you, you took
a wrong way, a wrong road.

1509
01:45:52,222 --> 01:45:55,340
What-- What road? Do you see
any roads around here?

1510
01:45:55,423 --> 01:45:59,338
You know what? l do not have
much pleasure being near God's ear.

1511
01:45:59,425 --> 01:46:01,893
But you think this is
looking good, or what?

1512
01:46:01,985 --> 01:46:06,265
Lev, why don't you just do humanity
a favour and just shut the hell up?

1513
01:46:10,548 --> 01:46:12,823
Have you ever heard
of Evel Knievel?

1514
01:46:12,948 --> 01:46:15,180
No, l never saw Star Wars.

1515
01:46:21,191 --> 01:46:23,547
All right.
Doin' a good job.

1516
01:46:23,672 --> 01:46:25,982
- Give me a depth reading, Max.
- We're 150 feet, Harry.

1517
01:46:31,194 --> 01:46:34,744
Ride 'em, cowboy!
Yippee-kai-yo, kai-yay!

1518
01:46:34,835 --> 01:46:38,876
Get off the nuclear warhead.

1519
01:46:38,957 --> 01:46:40,868
l was doin' that guy
from that movie, you know...

1520
01:46:40,997 --> 01:46:43,956
Slim Pickens, where he rides it
all the way in-- the nuclear warhead.

1521
01:46:44,078 --> 01:46:46,752
- Now.
- Oh, you didn't see that one, huh?

1522
01:46:46,879 --> 01:46:49,633
We got 700 feet of hole
to dig, Rockhound.

1523
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:53,554
All right. Just-- Just wanted to feel
the power between my legs, brother.

1524
01:46:54,761 --> 01:46:56,992
Hey, Sharp.

1525
01:46:57,082 --> 01:47:00,155
No nukes! No nukes!
No nukes!

1526
01:47:00,243 --> 01:47:02,154
You got any more bullets
in that gun, Sharp?

1527
01:47:02,363 --> 01:47:05,004
What did Watts tell you, Bear?
lf she kicked you in the balls,
you'd keep floating.

1528
01:47:05,125 --> 01:47:07,514
Yeah.

1529
01:47:08,565 --> 01:47:12,242
We turn the thrusters off, we jump
this thing, we float right over it.

1530
01:47:13,247 --> 01:47:14,919
Go over it again, Lev.

1531
01:47:15,047 --> 01:47:18,324
Throw the jet thrusters off
exactly when we jump.

1532
01:47:18,448 --> 01:47:21,965
- Okay.
- And then we're gonna put them on,
and we gonna go down nice and slow.

1533
01:47:22,090 --> 01:47:25,321
- That's it. That's it, baby. That's it.
- ls this gonna work?

1534
01:47:25,410 --> 01:47:29,451
- l don't know.
- Lev, you know what, just lie to me.

1535
01:47:29,532 --> 01:47:33,048
Let's say 50-50--
No. More like, uh--

1536
01:47:33,173 --> 01:47:35,209
like 70-30 or 80-20.

1537
01:47:35,293 --> 01:47:40,688
But you know what? lf it works, the two
of you gonna be heroes, just like me.

1538
01:47:40,775 --> 01:47:43,414
Screw it. We're jumpin'
over this canyon.

1539
01:47:47,337 --> 01:47:50,569
Just for the record,
this is a very bad idea!

1540
01:47:53,539 --> 01:47:57,579
- Wait for the edge now.
Wait till we get there. Wait--
- l'm waiting.

1541
01:47:57,700 --> 01:48:00,499
- Here we come. Now, not till we do it.
- Three...

1542
01:48:00,581 --> 01:48:02,891
- two, one!
- Here we go!

1543
01:48:03,022 --> 01:48:05,058
Off!

1544
01:48:12,465 --> 01:48:14,979
- Yes!
- lt's working!
- lt's working!

1545
01:48:15,105 --> 01:48:18,179
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah!

1546
01:48:18,307 --> 01:48:23,302
- l'm a genius! Wait a minute.
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1547
01:48:23,428 --> 01:48:27,901
- We got some rocks!
- Go left! Go left!
- Lev! Lev, l can't do anything!

1548
01:48:28,030 --> 01:48:30,749
Turn!

1549
01:48:37,072 --> 01:48:39,906
Oh, okay, okay, we're
floating into outer space.

1550
01:48:40,033 --> 01:48:42,183
- Check main switch.
- Uh, this could be
a little bit of a problem.

1551
01:48:43,554 --> 01:48:45,625
- Thrusters on now!
- All right, turn 'em on.

1552
01:48:48,555 --> 01:48:53,677
- What's wrong?
- l-l don't know. The-The thrusters
not working. l hate this machine!

1553
01:48:53,757 --> 01:48:56,067
- l thought you had this planned!
What're we supposed to do?
- Be quiet! l must think!

1554
01:48:56,198 --> 01:48:59,110
- l'm stepping outside.
- You're-You're going outside?

1555
01:48:59,238 --> 01:49:04,553
l am the only certified astronaut,
and l'm saving your American ass!

1556
01:49:08,722 --> 01:49:10,474
Yes. You'll listen
to him. Right.

1557
01:49:15,483 --> 01:49:19,114
Hurry up, Lev, because we're
about a mile off the asteroid!

1558
01:49:19,205 --> 01:49:22,322
Just a second.
The fuel line is iced up.

1559
01:49:22,445 --> 01:49:26,645
- Yeah, l think maybe workin' now.
- No, Lev, it's not working!

1560
01:49:26,727 --> 01:49:29,481
l'm sorry, A.J.
l was way off the odds.

1561
01:49:29,568 --> 01:49:33,960
- We're gettin' higher, man.
- Look out! The rocks! Rocks are coming!

1562
01:49:40,611 --> 01:49:42,523
Hold on!

1563
01:49:46,253 --> 01:49:48,608
- Pull the thrusters!
- Lev, look out!

1564
01:49:55,175 --> 01:49:58,613
- We lost Lev.
- A.J.!

1565
01:49:58,697 --> 01:50:00,767
A.J., the thrusters!

1566
01:50:04,418 --> 01:50:06,455
Let's get Lev back!

1567
01:50:14,582 --> 01:50:16,891
Lev, hold on!
We're comin' in!

1568
01:50:32,827 --> 01:50:36,707
Thank You, Jesus. Thank You, Lord.
Thank You. Thank You,
thank You, thank You.

1569
01:50:39,228 --> 01:50:44,145
- Lev!
- Now l'm really a Russian hero!

1570
01:50:44,270 --> 01:50:47,388
- l told you!
- l know!
- l knew this would work!

1571
01:50:47,511 --> 01:50:50,788
-Good odds, you know?
-Come on, Lev. Get in here. We gotta go.

1572
01:50:55,713 --> 01:50:57,865
Rockhound, keep
on that transmission.

1573
01:50:57,995 --> 01:51:01,067
- Tranny looks good, Harry.
- All right. Take it outta there.

1574
01:51:01,155 --> 01:51:04,706
Lock it down, Chick.

1575
01:51:04,837 --> 01:51:07,271
Nice.

1576
01:51:07,397 --> 01:51:09,912
How come we didn't get
any training on this thing?

1577
01:51:10,038 --> 01:51:14,670
Whoa. Very cool. l could take out
this asteroid single-handedly.

1578
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:16,955
Okay, boys, give it a rest.
l'll take it from here.

1579
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:20,641
- Whoa!
- What the hell is that?

1580
01:51:20,761 --> 01:51:24,311
-lt's Rockhound.
-Whoa. This is so much fun, it's freaky.

1581
01:51:26,243 --> 01:51:28,279
Rockhound!

1582
01:51:28,363 --> 01:51:30,400
Whoa, watch your heads.
Sorry, Harry.

1583
01:51:32,885 --> 01:51:35,524
- Outta my way, boys!
- Rockhound!

1584
01:51:35,645 --> 01:51:38,036
Meet your maker, asteroid!

1585
01:51:42,328 --> 01:51:45,878
- What the hell's the matter
with you, Rockhound? Goddam!
- This is insane.

1586
01:51:45,969 --> 01:51:49,326
- Have you lost your mind?
- He's got space dementia.

1587
01:51:49,450 --> 01:51:51,520
Harry, you ought to
watch your man.

1588
01:51:53,971 --> 01:51:58,922
Max, downshift slowly
and put it in reverse.
We gotta get that pipe outta there.

1589
01:51:59,053 --> 01:52:01,123
Uh-oh.

1590
01:52:03,574 --> 01:52:06,294
- What's happening?
- The ground's cracking!
- Earthquake!

1591
01:52:14,297 --> 01:52:16,289
Quick, shut it off!

1592
01:52:17,618 --> 01:52:20,817
- Shut it off! Shut it off now!
- We're gonna have a blowout!

1593
01:52:20,940 --> 01:52:24,819
- We hit a gas pocket!
- We got pressure out the ass!

1594
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:29,177
Max, get your helmet on!
Max, it's gonna blow!

1595
01:52:29,302 --> 01:52:32,261
- Oh, Jesus, l'm cooking!
- Max, get outta there!

1596
01:52:32,383 --> 01:52:34,943
This is it!

1597
01:52:35,063 --> 01:52:36,976
Harry!

1598
01:52:38,585 --> 01:52:40,496
l'm bailing!

1599
01:52:43,546 --> 01:52:44,980
Max!

1600
01:52:47,867 --> 01:52:50,462
- Goodbye, Max.
- Max!

1601
01:52:50,588 --> 01:52:53,467
- Take care, buddy.
- Armadillo's off the scope.

1602
01:52:53,589 --> 01:52:55,581
- l think we've had a blowout.
- No sign of the Armadillo.

1603
01:52:55,710 --> 01:52:57,780
Somebody punch up the Armadillo.

1604
01:53:25,999 --> 01:53:28,309
Get ahold of Truman.

1605
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:32,359
Prepare the world
for bad news.

1606
01:53:39,043 --> 01:53:43,435
We're getting sketchy information
that the mission has suffered
massive failure.

1607
01:53:43,565 --> 01:53:47,319
And what we're trying to do
right now is to confirm that
and find out exactly what that means.

1608
01:53:47,445 --> 01:53:50,244
Repeat: We're getting leaks
from several NASA officials...

1609
01:53:50,326 --> 01:53:55,243
some rushing home
to be with their families,
that the drilling was unsuccessful.

1610
01:54:04,210 --> 01:54:06,805
This could very well be
our final hour.

1611
01:54:10,612 --> 01:54:12,410
We're gonna go
off the air now.

1612
01:54:12,533 --> 01:54:15,287
Good luck
and God bless.

1613
01:54:18,775 --> 01:54:20,447
- We've got incoming.
- l got tracks.

1614
01:54:20,575 --> 01:54:24,490
NORAD's tracking four small
incoming over Europe. They think
one's about to hit near Paris.

1615
01:54:49,945 --> 01:54:53,779
- Reports are coming in--
- Martial law has been implemented
in 42 countries.

1616
01:54:53,865 --> 01:54:56,175
Once the asteroid hits
zero barrier...

1617
01:54:56,266 --> 01:55:00,419
it will take about three hours
and 57 minutes to impact Earth.

1618
01:55:04,068 --> 01:55:08,063
Well, l guess we do it
the president's way. l'll order an evac.
You can remote detonate.

1619
01:55:08,190 --> 01:55:11,227
- You still don't think
this'll work, do you?
- Well, what l think is irrelevant.

1620
01:55:11,310 --> 01:55:14,145
- We need to do it now.
- Fine.

1621
01:55:14,232 --> 01:55:16,223
- Can they still take off?
- We hope so.

1622
01:55:16,352 --> 01:55:18,309
You are the one
that pulled them into this!

1623
01:55:18,433 --> 01:55:22,188
That is my family up there,
so l don't wanna hear, ''We hope so''!

1624
01:55:27,235 --> 01:55:30,991
Guess what, guys?
lt's time to embrace the horror.

1625
01:55:31,117 --> 01:55:34,588
Look. We got front-row tickets
to the end of the Earth.

1626
01:55:55,884 --> 01:55:59,355
- Yeah! Way to go, baby!
- Harry!

1627
01:56:04,687 --> 01:56:08,363
- Yeah!
- Yo, Harry! What's up, baby?

1628
01:56:08,448 --> 01:56:11,281
Hey, get that bomb outta there!
We got a hole to make!

1629
01:56:12,609 --> 01:56:14,726
Houston, you're not
gonna believe this...

1630
01:56:14,850 --> 01:56:17,318
but the other Armadillo
has arrived.

1631
01:56:17,410 --> 01:56:20,643
All right, people, listen up.
Settle down and focus.

1632
01:56:20,772 --> 01:56:24,083
- Mechanical, get on-line.
- P.P.O., gimme a set-up.
- Your boyfriend's back.

1633
01:56:25,533 --> 01:56:27,888
- Yo, Harry!
- You're awesome, baby!

1634
01:56:29,294 --> 01:56:30,967
Hey, Harry.
You miss me?

1635
01:56:31,095 --> 01:56:34,485
A.J., l got
just five words for ya.

1636
01:56:34,615 --> 01:56:37,768
- Damn glad to see ya, boy!
- That's six words.

1637
01:56:37,897 --> 01:56:41,208
- Chick, walk 'em down.
- So where's this hole you need dug?

1638
01:56:41,298 --> 01:56:43,528
Houston, drilling has recommenced.

1639
01:56:43,658 --> 01:56:49,018
- Do you think they can drill
250 feet in an hour?
- They better.

1640
01:56:49,100 --> 01:56:51,614
Bring that piece on in, Bear.

1641
01:56:51,740 --> 01:56:53,892
Tractor pull.

1642
01:56:54,022 --> 01:56:57,538
- l'm comin' down!
- We got 250 feet to go.

1643
01:56:57,663 --> 01:57:00,575
lt's our last transmission,
last drill head.

1644
01:57:00,703 --> 01:57:04,539
Punch it through.
First gear. We got contact.

1645
01:57:04,625 --> 01:57:08,095
Drive it on down, A.J.

1646
01:57:08,225 --> 01:57:11,025
- l got this, man. Let's go!
- Lev, the right engine hub.

1647
01:57:11,147 --> 01:57:15,300
- Houston, l'm getting no response
from the preflight sequence.
- Come on now. This is not--

1648
01:57:15,428 --> 01:57:19,742
Hey. Hey, come here. Can you get me
outta here, please, Lev? Thank you.

1649
01:57:20,830 --> 01:57:23,947
- Ow! Jesus! Hey!
- Wait. Uh, shh, shh.

1650
01:57:24,030 --> 01:57:26,340
- Lev, the right engine--
- Okay.
- Lemme outta here, will ya?

1651
01:57:26,472 --> 01:57:29,305
Just tryin' to have
some fun before l die!

1652
01:57:29,432 --> 01:57:32,869
- How deep are we?
- Seven seventy.

1653
01:57:37,995 --> 01:57:39,986
- Whoa, they got problems.
- The gauges are spiking.

1654
01:57:40,115 --> 01:57:42,072
Methane! Shut it down!
Back it down!

1655
01:57:42,196 --> 01:57:46,031
l can't pull back now. The bit'll
get lodged. We don't have enough time!

1656
01:57:46,157 --> 01:57:49,753
Whoa, whoa, whoa! lt's gonna blow!
lt's how we lost Max!

1657
01:57:49,878 --> 01:57:53,509
l know what l'm talkin' about.
We can punch through this.
We can knock this outta the park.

1658
01:57:53,600 --> 01:57:56,034
- This is our last transmission, A.J.
- Goddam it!

1659
01:57:56,160 --> 01:58:00,280
lf you're ever gonna trust me, ever,
once in your life, trust me now!

1660
01:58:00,362 --> 01:58:04,515
- Harry, it's gonna blow!
- Harry, l know what l'm doin'.
You just gotta trust me.

1661
01:58:06,603 --> 01:58:08,640
Make the call.

1662
01:58:10,405 --> 01:58:12,919
All right. Hold on.
l'm pushin' through her.

1663
01:58:18,327 --> 01:58:20,922
l'm pushin' through her!

1664
01:58:21,048 --> 01:58:23,846
- What's your depth?
- Seven seventy-five. Seven eighty.

1665
01:58:23,968 --> 01:58:27,326
Take it up, baby! Ram it home!

1666
01:58:27,450 --> 01:58:31,284
- Drive on down, A.J.!
- Seven eighty-five. Come on. Come on.

1667
01:58:31,370 --> 01:58:34,284
- Come on, A.J.!
- Punch it!
- Ninety-one. Come on.

1668
01:58:34,412 --> 01:58:37,405
Seven ninety-two.
Seven ninety-five!

1669
01:58:37,533 --> 01:58:40,001
Drive it down, A.J.!

1670
01:58:40,133 --> 01:58:42,523
Seven ninety-seven!
Ninety-nine!

1671
01:58:42,615 --> 01:58:45,732
- Breakthrough!
- Eight hundred! 802, Harry!

1672
01:58:45,855 --> 01:58:49,405
- Yeah!
- We did it!
- Harry, we did it!

1673
01:58:49,537 --> 01:58:51,016
- Yes!
- We did it!

1674
01:58:51,137 --> 01:58:55,051
- Yeah! Kid, way to go!
- l knew it, baby!

1675
01:58:55,178 --> 01:58:58,888
- lt's not over till we get
the bomb down that hole.
- Watts, they've got 38 minutes.

1676
01:59:18,905 --> 01:59:23,378
- Harry, you've gotta give me that hole.
- l'm gonna need two more minutes.
l got a bent pipe jammed in the hole.

1677
01:59:23,507 --> 01:59:27,103
We gotta cut it out before we can
send that bomb down. A.J.!

1678
01:59:27,228 --> 01:59:29,901
- She good to go?
- Yeah, l'm all set.
- All right.

1679
01:59:35,750 --> 01:59:38,185
- All right.
- A.J., come on! Make it fast!

1680
01:59:38,271 --> 01:59:41,423
l'm goin' as fast as l can!
There's a lot of gas pressure!

1681
01:59:47,794 --> 01:59:50,946
- You feel that?
- Harry, you gotta give me that hole.
The bomb is almost ready.

1682
01:59:51,075 --> 01:59:54,751
- Pull that pipe out!
- Harry, l'm almost through!
Give me 15 more seconds!

1683
02:00:00,438 --> 02:00:02,998
Well, this is somethin' new.

1684
02:00:05,039 --> 02:00:08,828
- l don't think this thing likes us.
- That's 'cause it knows
we're here to kill it.

1685
02:00:14,042 --> 02:00:16,476
Hey, what's goin' on
up there?

1686
02:00:20,243 --> 02:00:24,033
- A.J.!
- What the hell was that?

1687
02:00:24,165 --> 02:00:27,077
- A.J.!
- Goddam it, l'm finished!

1688
02:00:28,686 --> 02:00:31,201
- A.J., you all right?
- Oh, lot of gas pressure in here, man!

1689
02:00:31,287 --> 02:00:33,961
- Get me out!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hydrogen pocket!

1690
02:00:51,653 --> 02:00:53,689
Harry! Pull me in!

1691
02:00:58,095 --> 02:01:00,211
A.J., hang on!

1692
02:01:04,737 --> 02:01:07,298
Secure the bomb!

1693
02:01:07,418 --> 02:01:10,057
Sharp, heads up!

1694
02:01:10,138 --> 02:01:12,131
Gruber! Get outta there now!

1695
02:01:13,700 --> 02:01:15,372
Oh, no.

1696
02:01:23,102 --> 02:01:24,980
Oh, God, no!

1697
02:01:30,145 --> 02:01:32,613
Look out!

1698
02:01:35,066 --> 02:01:38,423
Help! Oh, no!

1699
02:01:45,550 --> 02:01:47,905
Do you believe
that just happened?

1700
02:01:50,590 --> 02:01:53,152
- Sharp, you all right?
- l'm okay.

1701
02:01:53,232 --> 02:01:55,302
- Bear?
- Yeah. l'm here, Harry.

1702
02:01:55,432 --> 02:01:57,788
- A.J.?
- Yeah, l'm okay.

1703
02:02:00,353 --> 02:02:02,266
We lost Gruber.

1704
02:02:03,435 --> 02:02:07,394
- Gruber's dead.
- Let's get that bomb ready and go home.

1705
02:02:15,078 --> 02:02:17,309
Oh, my God.

1706
02:02:17,439 --> 02:02:21,513
- ls there a problem, Colonel?
- The timer, the remote,
the whole thing's dead.

1707
02:02:21,640 --> 02:02:23,596
What, the bomb is dead?

1708
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:28,079
No, the trigger's dead. lt must've
gotten damaged during the rock storm.

1709
02:02:30,043 --> 02:02:32,557
So how do we detonate it?

1710
02:02:41,286 --> 02:02:45,963
We have 18 minutes to zero barrier.
We got some bad news.

1711
02:02:46,087 --> 02:02:49,080
The remote detonator on the bomb
has been damaged.

1712
02:02:49,208 --> 02:02:51,929
That means that somebody's
gonna have to stay behind.

1713
02:02:54,450 --> 02:02:56,645
lt takes two people
to fly this thing.

1714
02:02:56,730 --> 02:03:01,487
Either we all stay and die,
or you guys draw straws.

1715
02:03:01,572 --> 02:03:05,122
l say we all stay and die.
But that's me.

1716
02:03:06,173 --> 02:03:09,531
l'll draw. Let's draw.

1717
02:03:10,415 --> 02:03:12,883
Nobody's gonna draw straws.

1718
02:03:13,015 --> 02:03:15,611
- l'll stay and take care of it.
- Well, l can't live
with that sort of thing.

1719
02:03:15,737 --> 02:03:17,614
- Nobody asked you if you could
live with it, all right?
- Bullshit!

1720
02:03:17,697 --> 02:03:20,212
No way l will let you
volunteer for this...

1721
02:03:20,298 --> 02:03:23,848
so l can go back to my home country
like the man who didn't volunteer.

1722
02:03:23,939 --> 02:03:25,771
No way!

1723
02:03:25,860 --> 02:03:29,978
Hey, man, let's draw, and let's see
who's gonna stay up here and dance.

1724
02:03:30,100 --> 02:03:32,741
Guys, l-l-l know you guys
think l'm crazy right now...

1725
02:03:32,862 --> 02:03:36,458
but l would really like
this responsibility.

1726
02:03:36,583 --> 02:03:39,143
All right. All right.

1727
02:03:39,263 --> 02:03:41,334
- l can do it.
- Let's just draw straws and
get it over with. Come on.

1728
02:03:41,424 --> 02:03:43,256
l ain't drawin'
against you, Harry.

1729
02:03:43,345 --> 02:03:47,578
Well, l'm gonna draw against you, Chick,
so you better just go ahead and do it.

1730
02:03:47,706 --> 02:03:49,823
Just gimme this thing.

1731
02:03:56,348 --> 02:03:58,784
ls this good or bad?

1732
02:04:03,710 --> 02:04:07,227
Oh, man.

1733
02:04:07,312 --> 02:04:09,952
Well, we all gotta die, right?

1734
02:04:13,193 --> 02:04:16,028
l'm the guy who gets
to do it saving the world.

1735
02:04:16,115 --> 02:04:19,391
So, uh, let's go. We-We got
about ten minutes, right?

1736
02:04:21,196 --> 02:04:23,074
You plug this into the port.

1737
02:04:23,157 --> 02:04:27,549
Lift, press, hold. That's it.

1738
02:04:27,638 --> 02:04:31,553
Lift, press, hold. Shouldn't be
too tough. Even l can't screw this up.

1739
02:04:31,640 --> 02:04:34,154
l'll take him down.

1740
02:05:07,730 --> 02:05:12,408
Do me a favour, will ya?
Just tell Grace that, uh--

1741
02:05:12,532 --> 02:05:15,126
that l'll always be
with her, okay?

1742
02:05:17,253 --> 02:05:19,084
Can you do that?

1743
02:05:20,614 --> 02:05:22,651
Yeah. Okay, kid.

1744
02:05:28,457 --> 02:05:30,448
Give this to Truman.

1745
02:05:30,537 --> 02:05:34,497
Make sure Truman gets that.
Get in there.

1746
02:05:39,300 --> 02:05:41,370
lt's my turn now.

1747
02:05:42,620 --> 02:05:44,816
Harry! Harry!

1748
02:05:44,942 --> 02:05:48,298
You can't do this to me!

1749
02:05:48,422 --> 02:05:50,300
lt's my job!

1750
02:05:50,383 --> 02:05:54,343
You go take care of my little girl now.
That's your job.

1751
02:05:57,305 --> 02:06:00,298
Always thought of you
as a son. Always.

1752
02:06:01,867 --> 02:06:05,907
But l'd be damn proud
to have you marry Grace.

1753
02:06:06,028 --> 02:06:08,542
- Harry.
- You take care of yourself.

1754
02:06:08,628 --> 02:06:10,540
- Harry, no!
- l love you, pal.

1755
02:06:10,669 --> 02:06:13,423
Harry, l love you!
Don't, Harry! Wait a minute!

1756
02:06:13,550 --> 02:06:15,939
- My son.
- No, don't do this, Harry!

1757
02:06:16,070 --> 02:06:18,506
You don't do this! Harry!

1758
02:06:26,554 --> 02:06:28,705
What happened?

1759
02:06:28,795 --> 02:06:31,309
That crazy,
stubborn son of a--

1760
02:06:37,397 --> 02:06:40,834
Well, this was
a real good idea.

1761
02:06:40,958 --> 02:06:44,269
All right, let's go, Sharp.
Let's get our team outta here.

1762
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:53,712
Come on! Let's get ready
to initiate thrusters! Let's go!

1763
02:06:53,842 --> 02:06:56,311
- l mean it, guys!
- Get the O2 masks.

1764
02:06:56,443 --> 02:06:59,003
- Are they free? Are they free?
- B.P.U., set.

1765
02:06:59,123 --> 02:07:02,481
l cannot believe this is going down
like this. You all right?

1766
02:07:02,565 --> 02:07:05,921
- O2 vents locked, pressure loaded.
- Engine board is green.

1767
02:07:08,327 --> 02:07:10,966
T minus three minutes
and counting.

1768
02:07:11,047 --> 02:07:13,562
Houston, do you copy?
This is Harry Stamper.

1769
02:07:14,888 --> 02:07:17,198
lt's down there.

1770
02:07:18,410 --> 02:07:23,040
- Electrical systems primed.
- B.P.U. is set. Oxidizers are loading.

1771
02:07:23,171 --> 02:07:27,324
Houston, we're outta here
in T minus three minutes.

1772
02:07:27,452 --> 02:07:29,523
Daddy?

1773
02:07:29,613 --> 02:07:32,571
Hi, Gracie. Hi, honey.

1774
02:07:32,653 --> 02:07:35,965
Grace, l know l promised you
l was comin' home.

1775
02:07:37,495 --> 02:07:39,326
l don't under-- understand.

1776
02:07:40,696 --> 02:07:43,814
Looks like l'm gonna have to
break that promise.

1777
02:07:46,058 --> 02:07:49,972
l, um--
l lied to you too...

1778
02:07:50,099 --> 02:07:52,660
when l told you that
l didn't want to be like you.

1779
02:07:54,580 --> 02:07:56,492
Because l am like you.

1780
02:07:56,621 --> 02:08:02,061
And everything good that l have
inside of me, l have from you.

1781
02:08:02,143 --> 02:08:04,657
l love you so much, Daddy.

1782
02:08:04,783 --> 02:08:07,423
l'm so proud of you.

1783
02:08:07,545 --> 02:08:09,661
l'm so scared.

1784
02:08:09,785 --> 02:08:11,821
l'm so scared.

1785
02:08:11,905 --> 02:08:16,742
l know it, baby, but there won't be
anything to be scared of soon.

1786
02:08:19,268 --> 02:08:24,469
Gracie, l want you to know
that A.J. saved us. He did.

1787
02:08:25,830 --> 02:08:27,786
l want you to tell Chick...

1788
02:08:27,870 --> 02:08:31,626
that l couldn't have done it
without him, none of it.

1789
02:08:33,152 --> 02:08:35,143
l want you
to take care of A.J.

1790
02:08:39,794 --> 02:08:42,434
l wish l could be there
to walk you down the aisle.

1791
02:08:45,635 --> 02:08:47,467
But l'll--

1792
02:08:49,877 --> 02:08:53,109
l'll look in on you from
time to time, okay, honey?

1793
02:08:55,438 --> 02:08:58,557
- l love you, Grace.
- l love you too.

1794
02:08:58,640 --> 02:09:01,279
- l gotta go now, honey.
- Daddy, no.

1795
02:09:02,520 --> 02:09:05,912
No, no, Dad, no!

1796
02:09:11,203 --> 02:09:14,675
O.M.S. pod pre-start.
O2 vents locked, pressure loaded.

1797
02:09:17,005 --> 02:09:19,041
What the hell's goin' on up there?
Why haven't you guys left yet?

1798
02:09:19,125 --> 02:09:21,766
We're going, Harry.
Houston.

1799
02:09:21,887 --> 02:09:24,321
- We got O.M.S. pod pre-start.
- Pod pre-start confirmed.

1800
02:09:28,048 --> 02:09:31,087
- What's the problem?
- l don't know.
- What's wrong?
- Fix it now!

1801
02:09:32,210 --> 02:09:34,201
No time, no time!

1802
02:09:34,290 --> 02:09:36,168
- What?
- What's that?

1803
02:09:39,852 --> 02:09:41,923
- Where you goin'?
- Oh, come on.
We're stayin', we're goin'.

1804
02:09:42,013 --> 02:09:43,844
We're stayin', we're goin'.
Make up your minds.

1805
02:09:43,933 --> 02:09:47,814
Damn it, Sharp! Get out of here now.
You got less than three minutes.

1806
02:09:50,975 --> 02:09:54,765
- Come on, Watts. Come on, come on.
- Blow the bomb, Harry. We're with you.

1807
02:09:54,897 --> 02:09:58,207
- Uh, it's stuck. Yes?
- Come on! Back off!
You don't know the components!

1808
02:09:58,298 --> 02:10:03,054
Components, American components,
Russian components. All made in Taiwan!

1809
02:10:03,139 --> 02:10:05,449
We're gettin' tight
for ignition, Freedom.

1810
02:10:08,380 --> 02:10:10,611
- Houston, we've got no fire.
- What does that mean?

1811
02:10:10,742 --> 02:10:14,257
- lt means we got a busted ship.
- A busted ship?
And l'm strapped in here?

1812
02:10:14,382 --> 02:10:16,374
l had a great spot
picked out there.

1813
02:10:16,503 --> 02:10:19,860
Freedom, you fire that engine.
lf there's not a way, you find
a way. The clock's tickin'.

1814
02:10:19,944 --> 02:10:22,254
Let's go! Let's fire
that engine, Freedom!

1815
02:10:22,385 --> 02:10:27,176
You got less than a minute.
Don't think l won't blow this thing.

1816
02:10:27,266 --> 02:10:29,781
Sharp, get out of here.
lt's gettin' bad down here.

1817
02:10:29,867 --> 02:10:31,859
l know how to fix it.
Please, move.

1818
02:10:31,988 --> 02:10:34,104
l-l have to take you away
if you don't move.

1819
02:10:34,228 --> 02:10:36,982
Watts, you gotta get that shuttle
started. You gotta fire it up now!

1820
02:10:37,070 --> 02:10:39,186
Damn it, Sharp.
Get off this rock!

1821
02:10:39,270 --> 02:10:42,581
l'm telling you, please, move!
This is how we fix problem...

1822
02:10:42,711 --> 02:10:45,749
in the Russian space station.

1823
02:10:45,832 --> 02:10:49,269
Because l don't want
to stay here any more.

1824
02:10:50,953 --> 02:10:54,789
Yeah! Finally!
We can go home!

1825
02:10:54,915 --> 02:10:57,145
- She's coming back. She's coming back.
- We're hot!

1826
02:10:57,235 --> 02:10:59,955
Watts, let's go, let's go!

1827
02:11:00,076 --> 02:11:03,114
Rain all you want,
you son of a bitch.

1828
02:11:03,237 --> 02:11:06,230
Let's go! We don't have time!
Hurry, hurry. We got no time!

1829
02:11:06,318 --> 02:11:09,948
lnitiate thrusters on my mark!
Two, one-- Mark!

1830
02:11:17,842 --> 02:11:21,278
- Come on. Get some altitude.
Let's go, let's go.
- Yes, come on!

1831
02:11:22,683 --> 02:11:24,799
Freedom has max thrust!

1832
02:11:31,245 --> 02:11:33,760
Thank you, Harry.

1833
02:11:43,369 --> 02:11:45,361
Shuttle's out of range.
Still no detonation.

1834
02:11:49,811 --> 02:11:52,724
Something's not right.
Too much time has gone by.

1835
02:11:54,292 --> 02:11:56,523
Zero barrier's about to be breached.
One minute.

1836
02:11:56,613 --> 02:11:59,082
Harry, come on.
Press that button.

1837
02:11:59,214 --> 02:12:03,208
- We're goin' back and do it ourselves.
- Just don't. Wait one minute.

1838
02:12:07,457 --> 02:12:10,176
- Dan, we're about
to cross the threshold.
- Come on, Harry. Press the button.

1839
02:12:10,297 --> 02:12:14,928
Colonel, l'm askin' you.
Just one more minute!

1840
02:12:20,940 --> 02:12:23,580
Press the button, Stamper.

1841
02:12:26,142 --> 02:12:28,577
Come on.

1842
02:12:30,063 --> 02:12:32,214
Harry'll do it. l know it.

1843
02:12:33,865 --> 02:12:36,425
He doesn't know how to fail.

1844
02:12:42,187 --> 02:12:43,859
We win, Gracie!

1845
02:12:45,468 --> 02:12:47,538
Press it!

1846
02:13:18,118 --> 02:13:21,349
We have detonation.
Confirming detonation.

1847
02:13:38,163 --> 02:13:40,554
The two halves are gonna miss us
by 400 miles...

1848
02:13:40,645 --> 02:13:43,921
and most of the small particles
have been vaporized.

1849
02:13:53,808 --> 02:13:56,608
- Houston, we're comin' home.
- We copy that, Freedom.

1850
02:13:56,730 --> 02:14:00,279
Yo, Harry. You the man.

1851
02:14:51,345 --> 02:14:54,817
Kennedy, we see you.
And you never looked so good.

1852
02:14:54,947 --> 02:15:00,306
l never told anybody
this before, but l hate flyin',
so it'd be an awful shame to die now.

1853
02:15:00,428 --> 02:15:04,469
That's easy for you to say. l owe
100 grand to a bad-ass loan shark...

1854
02:15:04,590 --> 02:15:07,104
which l spent on a stripper
named Molly Mounds.

1855
02:15:07,190 --> 02:15:10,184
- Boy, that's bad.
- Kennedy, we are 100%.

1856
02:15:10,272 --> 02:15:12,740
Flap suspension control on full.

1857
02:15:24,875 --> 02:15:27,186
Welcome home, astronauts.

1858
02:15:34,759 --> 02:15:36,876
Hey, guys, remember:
We're-- We're heroes now.

1859
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:39,269
So that incident with me
and the gun on the asteroid--

1860
02:15:39,360 --> 02:15:41,716
Let's keep that under wraps,
all right?

1861
02:16:43,340 --> 02:16:45,217
Miss Stamper?

1862
02:16:46,540 --> 02:16:49,852
Colonel Willie Sharp,
United States Air Force, ma'am.

1863
02:16:49,942 --> 02:16:52,661
Requesting permission to shake
the hand of the daughter...

1864
02:16:52,782 --> 02:16:54,694
of the bravest man
l've ever met.

1865
02:17:01,025 --> 02:17:02,856
Hello.

1866
02:17:02,985 --> 02:17:05,420
- Oh, my God!
- Hi, you're my hero.

1867
02:17:05,546 --> 02:17:09,062
Oh, baby, l wanna have babies
with you.

1868
02:17:10,908 --> 02:17:12,739
Welcome back, cowboy.

1869
02:17:14,629 --> 02:17:18,669
Uh, Harry wanted you
to have this.

1870
02:17:24,952 --> 02:17:26,829
He did, huh?

1871
02:17:43,518 --> 02:17:45,793
l could stay awake

1872
02:17:45,918 --> 02:17:50,914
Just to hear you breathin'

1873
02:17:51,040 --> 02:17:54,636
Watch you smile while you are sleepin'

1874
02:17:54,761 --> 02:17:59,040
While you're far away and dreamin'

1875
02:17:59,122 --> 02:18:03,002
l just wanna stay with you

1876
02:18:03,083 --> 02:18:05,679
ln this moment forever

1877
02:18:05,805 --> 02:18:08,524
Forever and ever

1878
02:18:08,645 --> 02:18:12,161
l don't wanna close my eyes

1879
02:18:12,286 --> 02:18:14,721
l don't wanna fall asleep

1880
02:18:14,847 --> 02:18:16,759
'Cause l'd miss you, baby

1881
02:18:16,848 --> 02:18:19,840
And l don't wanna miss a thing

1882
02:18:19,928 --> 02:18:23,718
'Cause even when l dream of you

1883
02:18:23,850 --> 02:18:26,410
The sweetest dream would never do

1884
02:18:26,490 --> 02:18:28,322
l'd still miss you, baby

1885
02:18:28,411 --> 02:18:31,131
And l don't wanna miss a thing

1886
02:18:31,252 --> 02:18:35,166
And l don't wanna miss one smile

1887
02:18:35,253 --> 02:18:39,089
And l don't wanna miss one kiss

1888
02:18:39,215 --> 02:18:42,412
Well, l just wanna be
with you right here

1889
02:18:42,495 --> 02:18:46,410
With you just like this

1890
02:18:46,537 --> 02:18:50,497
Well, l just wanna hold you close

1891
02:18:50,618 --> 02:18:54,658
Feel your heart so close to mine

1892
02:18:54,779 --> 02:18:58,136
And just stay here in this moment

1893
02:18:58,260 --> 02:19:02,699
For all the rest of time
