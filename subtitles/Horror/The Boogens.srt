11
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,200
Was about time fellas.
Bring that generator over here.

12
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,100
Alright, alright.

13
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,700
I'll tell you. I'm going nuts.
I can't take any more of this.

14
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,545
You know, it's been 11
days and 6 hours...

15
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:36,358
- Is that all you can think about?
Getting Laid?

16
00:03:36,384 --> 00:03:37,750
I mean she's coming 
up tomorrow.

17
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,125
I'm not talking about getting laid.
I'm talking about that's...

18
00:03:41,131 --> 00:03:42,605
...how long it's been
since I last saw her.

19
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,700
I'm sorry, I must have 
lost my head.

20
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,700
Jesus, you must think I'm a 
sex maniac or something.

21
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,300
Actually, it's been 11 days and 7
hours since I last got laid.

22
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,700
Why would I think
you're a sex maniac?

23
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,050
What can I say? I looked at the
clock next to the bed.

24
00:03:58,176 --> 00:04:00,825
I'd like to remember the major
events in my life.

25
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,400
Come on, come on. 
Come on, come on.

26
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,400
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
Right over there.

27
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,500
Mark, we're operating 
on channel 2.

28
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,800
Keep those radios on all the 
time we're in the mine.

29
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,300
Right, right.

30
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,600
Any questions don't
hesitate to ask

31
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:21,600
Right

32
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,600
When we're in the mines the rules are
simple enough for you to understand.

33
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,900
No fucking around.

34
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,200
Watch your step and keep
track of your buddies.

35
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,800
This place has been closed since 1912,
no telling what kind of shape it's in.

36
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,200
Danel and I have re-opened a lot of
these mines and fellas..

37
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,000
...as long as you do exactly as you're told
there shouldn't be anything to worry about.

38
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,800
- You got that Rog?
- Oh, yes, sir!

39
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,400
- Where'd you find this guy?
- Under a rock.

40
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,100
Good! He should feel 
right at home.

41
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,200
Ok,  move it guys.
Get going.

42
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,932
- Isn't Frank coming?
- Yeah. He'll catch up to us.

43
00:05:09,158 --> 00:05:11,225
- He's gotta check in
with the office.

44
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,000
Great, Brian gets the trailer
and we get the shaft.

45
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,400
You guys hang back
about 10-15 feet.

46
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,700
What are we doing?

47
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,300
He's checking the beams.
See if we have to replace any.

48
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,300
That one's alright.

49
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,700
That one's alright?

50
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,100
That one's alright?

51
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,951
Maybe Brian needs some
help with the trailer.

52
00:05:38,977 --> 00:05:40,825
You know I'm a good 
trailer man.

53
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,700
Come on.

54
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,300
This one's gotta go.

55
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,900
- Why did they close this mine
in the first pace? - Cave-in.

56
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,500
I don't think we're getting
paid enough for this job.

57
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Jesus.

58
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,200
- You guys alright?
- Yeah, yeah. We're fine.

59
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,500
- You smell anything?
- No, no. Why?

60
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,900
I just shit my pants.

61
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,500
You might already be one of
interrupt this little surprise.

62
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,300
I know what the blind Randes.

63
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,500
This is not blind got a date.
- Yes, of course.

64
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,300
He will come on the weekend to help Jessica to move.
Name is Trish, they went to school together.

65
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,800
I remember the last thing that you've got a date
set up, it's a great girl...

66
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,400
Quasimodo  daughter.

67
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,200
No! Svideæe you Trish. Really!

68
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,900
You did?

69
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,400
Furnished said.

70
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
Let there be light.

71
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,300
This is it.

72
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,800
Yes, you're right, Dan, looks bad.

73
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,900
This will suit you. What do you say, want to
Treis or want to peaèi?

74
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,400
Hell, peaèimo.

75
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,400
OK.

76
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,700
Better hurry.

77
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,100
I'm telling you, with Trisa
to get along.

78
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,100
Listen, I want the whole weekend
to be alone, okay?

79
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,000
Good, turn on the lights.
I get out of here. - OK.

80
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,000
Has perfect tits.

81
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,400
Knock it off already.

82
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,600
Perfect boobs...
- I'm telling you, I saw them.

83
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,900
You see them? Both of the two?
- Yes, we have taken a hot bath together.

84
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:46,900
Hot bath?

85
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,300
Hey, guys, we did a good job today.
Let me buy you a drink.

86
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,800
Not tonight, Roger and I have to pack.
She's moving into a new house tomorrow after work.

87
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,500
See you tomorrow!

88
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Thanks for the warning!

89
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,600
Oh, my God!

90
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,700
Shit.

91
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,800
Damn deer.

92
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,700
Damn.

93
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,500
Shut up!

94
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,900
Hi, it's me.
I'm at home.

95
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,100
I thought I'd stop by the house,
to light a fire.

96
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,900
Coming tomorrow!

97
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,500
I got the earlier you do it?
I do not think so.

98
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:41,900
Listen, I'll have to spend the night here,
because the car was in the ditch.

99
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,200
Do not... Derailed deer before me.

100
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,000
Unleash it!

101
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,200
Because the car was in the damn ditch.

102
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,400
Mean me. There is no
food, and already starving.

103
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,600
No, it's fine, there's no point
izostane from work tomorrow.

104
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,200
I'll already be somehow
car's only problem.

105
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,500
I'll be fine.
I'll see you tomorrow.

106
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,000
I love you.

107
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,500
This unit No.147.

108
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:50,200
License plate number:
È as Charlie, a B Baker

109
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,700
S as freezing as
and my ass here... 117,

110
00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:00,300
Message received. I repeat: EBS 117?

111
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,700
're Talking today with the Guard?

112
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:08,600
Some 20 minutes.
82 degrees Fahrenheit and has a sunny weather.

113
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,900
Received.
I'm going back to base. End patrols.

114
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,600
Message received.

115
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,400
Now what?
To put the lamp?

116
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,500
According to the map this way
should be split into two parts.

117
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,600
Look again.

118
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,900
Well Brian, it depends on you whether
are you going to keep the bag and apron

119
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,200
Or you can choose a tunnel No.1, No.2
tunnel or tunnel No.3.

120
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,700
Here.

121
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,100
Collapse.
- Yes.

122
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,200
Why they closed the mine 1920s?

123
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,400
This is not even on this
damn map.

124
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,800
These maps are not good.

125
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:39,100
What do we do?
- This damn thing is 70 years old.

126
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,100
I'll be back and I'll call the office
if you have a newer version.

127
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,000
In the meantime, you clean up
points to this. Let's go!

128
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,800
Come on, Molly, you can not do that.

129
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,100
You have not changed. I still give
female names in my car?

130
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm still better than Roger.
Do you know that he gives the names of their body parts?

131
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,900
You're kidding.

132
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,300
Are you ready for this?

133
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,900
Name him Herman.

134
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,900
You do know everything!

135
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,100
Trish, my dear, you should be
navigatorka. Remember?

136
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,500
I know it would be much easier,

137
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,700
if painted by
roads as indicated on maps.

138
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
What?

139
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,700
You know, the blue paths of blue lines,
red roads to the red line.

140
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,900
Yeah...

141
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,900
Well, while you're thinking about this,
we shall pay homage to nature.

142
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,600
You need to go left.

143
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,400
Great, now this.

144
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,300
Tiger!
Tiger, Tiger, Tiger, Tiger, Tiger!

145
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Tiger!

146
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,300
Come on, Tiger!

147
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,700
Come on, little pokvarenjaèe!
Come on, Tiger!

148
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,900
Jessica, this would not listen to us at all.

149
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,800
Yes, I know, this is stupid. Let's go back.

150
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,800
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Jesse, this happens every time.

151
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,200
What can I say, I said I was sorry.

152
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,400
Sweet.

153
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,400
Let's drown the little bastard.

154
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,100
Here.

155
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,100
This is what I went to school?

156
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,600
At least I understand this.

157
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,800
Holy shit.

158
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,600
What is this?
- Come and see for yourself.

159
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,200
What do you guys think?
- This is amazing.

160
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,100
This is a natural cave?
- Exactly.

161
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,800
What is it? - What?
- Over there.

162
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,700
What you get?
- I do not know.

163
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,300
Looks human. - Yes, he was definitely one of those
miners stuck.

164
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,700
Say when do you want guys to pack,
I'm for it.

165
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,700
Hey, look over there.

166
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,700
There are at least 20-30 people.

167
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,900
It is, Mark. There were 30 people there.

168
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,700
Now there are only 3 man and a
huge pile of bones.

169
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,300
Brian?

170
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:29,800
Do?

171
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,300
It will be better if the sides down here.

172
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,700
Silver City

173
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,900
is not exactly what I had imagined.

174
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,800
Why here? Why did we have to come here
?

175
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,700
Saw the homeless there?

176
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,500
Look, Roger said that the house was great and
will come and Mark.

177
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,500
I hope that's the truth.

178
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,700
Do not worry Jess, this is a sweet little
gradiæ,

179
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,900
and I'd bet that the same people and
so kind.

180
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,300
Hi, how are you?

181
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,600
Tigre, stop it!

182
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,900
This is my bed.

183
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,100
This will be a good track to me and Rodz.

184
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,900
The Total sexual maniac.

185
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,300
Just purely for information...?

186
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,600
It's been 12 days...

187
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,500
O, this will not serve you.

188
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,500
just distract you with something, I do not think

189
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,400
we're going to see a lot of
The next three days.

190
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,500
I think I'll take a cold shower,
because these stories are killing me.

191
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,200
But there will be a Mark!

192
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,000
This dressed anywhere we can go.

193
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,500
There is no hot water.
- I thought you wanted a cold.

194
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,200
Ice cubes drop from the tap.

195
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,000
Where is the heated water in these places?
Surely you just need to switch on the heater warmed.

196
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,300
Mostly in the basement.

197
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,400
Oh, man.

198
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,300
Jesus.

199
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:00,100
These little prokletnièe!
If I catch you...!

200
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,100
Roger, I'm not interested.

201
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,500
Uhvatiæu is pocepaæu
with all her clothes, piece by piece,

202
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,600
until I saw every Deliæ
her beautiful naked body.

203
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,300
After 'll be entered into spaæu room
oboriæu on the bed,

204
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,600
poèeæu the toes,
after that I'll lick the...

205
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,000
Jesus, you're disgusting.

206
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:43,700
Wait!

207
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,700
Wait.

208
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,400
Just got a call from Denver, we have a few new folder
, Roger, you should go for them.

209
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,300
You're kidding, are not you, Brian?
- I'm dead serious.

210
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,600
Brian, my girlfriend had just arrived.
It's already 12 days!

211
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,700
What am I, damn, damn you got a date line?
We're trying to open a mine.

212
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,400
What would I go?

213
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,800
Yeah, how about we go on?

214
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,200
I need Mark, tomorrow we will start to
binding wire.

215
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,000
Brian, can every other evening just not tonight.
I'd rather come here to work but...

216
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:16,900
You do not have to go before 3 am, it should be
enough time for what you have in mind.

217
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,000
I want you to come back tomorrow afternoon
, at 3h40 '.

218
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,700
OK.
- Do not be late!

219
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,400
Yes.

220
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,900
What about the car?

221
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,700
It'll be up tonight.
- We'll probably have dinner in the city?

222
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,400
Well, Dan and I are going to play pool with
Goat.

223
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,200
Come here.
Do you take the keys.

224
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,000
OK.

225
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:35,700
Around 9am.

226
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:36,600
Yeah, right.

227
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,100
OK. We'll see you there.

228
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:42,000
Hey, guy, do not be
prenapregne in business.

229
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,500
Yes, of course.

230
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,200
What are you laughing at?
- Oh, nothing.

231
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,200
Come on, you would not be able to get laid
all night even if he wanted to.

232
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,600
What? You doubt the ability of the hormone
man?

233
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:03,400
There is a hormonal man!
Able to satisfy any woman!

234
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:08,500
Hormonal man against
sadness, loneliness and dissatisfaction.

235
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,300
Hormonal man!

236
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:24,300
Roger, stop it!
Please stop!

237
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,700
Please!

238
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,200
What's going on here...

239
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,800
I thought he attacked
a total stranger.

240
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,400
No, Trish. What, you did not have
where to go, huh?

241
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,400
No, I did not want to leave in two
.

242
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,900
Apologize. I'm Mark.

243
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,900
Oh, yes. Bye.

244
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,200
Trish.

245
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,100
If you do not mind...
We'II finish what I have begun.

246
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,700
Mind, I definitely considered.

247
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,400
Roger, you've been too long in the mountains,
infect your brain.

248
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,400
Yes, you're right, but my brain is not
part of that body who is having problems.

249
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,100
Hey, guys, you will not close the door
before you start the mission?

250
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,100
Hi, Mark.
- Hi, Jessica.

251
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,600
Good day, Mark.

252
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,900
Goodbye.

253
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,200
Hello, killer.

254
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,100
What is it, Lassie? Jimmy is in trouble?

255
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,000
Hey, whatever it is down there,
probably twice bigger than you,

256
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,600
and in the blink of an eye would have whacked,
in it can not be sure.

257
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,400
Okay, you ready?
Shoot down!

258
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,400
Knew...

259
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,500
Come here and sit down. Time to man and dog
little talk.

260
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,200
Uskaèi.

261
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,200
Good guy.

262
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,200
Listen to me. This will be very

263
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,900
Dugaèka  winter, especially for
if you're not present clear.

264
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,400
And the trailers outside is very cold,
that says your name, dude.

265
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,400
I see you've met with Tiger.

266
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,700
I too well.

267
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,000
There is beer?

268
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,200
In the fridge. Help yourself.

269
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,700
Practically, we are cousins.

270
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,200
What do you say, Tiger, you want a beer?

271
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,500
Mani him, he was still a minor.

272
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,500
Is there a couch that you need to tear
,

273
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,500
carpet that needs to pee?

274
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,200
He listens.

275
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,600
Well, Jessica had simply
threw at me.

276
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,600
Did she say what I did
Tigris for Christmas?

277
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,100
I made a miniature
electric chair for dogs.

278
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,800
Really done, I'm done.

279
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,200
You do it as a hobby or are you
a professional performer for dogs?

280
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:00,300
I just used my college education with
job, an electrical engineer.

281
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,400
And how do you become a miner?

282
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:10,400
Couple company asked me to do
electrical engineer them immediately after graduation.

283
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,500
I'm not prepared for this.

284
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,700
So we came in with Roger
mountains to do this mining stuff.

285
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,600
This is just a job.

286
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,500
So what's your story?

287
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,500
Jesse and I are going to the same school.
Journalism.

288
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:36,100
They offered me a job in the Denver Post, and
I moved from Pennsylvania two weeks ago.

289
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,100
So you're a writer?

290
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,000
In a weekly periodical.
Some kind of wizard.

291
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,700
I'm glad I met you.
- The same.

292
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,600
Excuse me.

293
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,500
Oh, hey, come.

294
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,500
Thank you.

295
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,900
I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm looking lady
who owns this house, Martha Èepmen.

296
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,000
I have not seen.

297
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:14,900
Trish?

298
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,300
No, I have not seen anyone since
we got there, about 4h before.

299
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,400
She was supposed to come here because of you.
That's when they were last heard of her.

300
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,800
We found her car a half-mile of
times.

301
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,800
My partner potisao papers.
I have never met these people.

302
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,900
Is that Roger Lavra?
- Yes.

303
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,600
Is he here?

304
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,100
I would talk to him.

305
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,800
Well, I'll be in in a minute.

306
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,300
O, Jess...

307
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:57,900
Hey, Roger!

308
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,700
Better be something good.

309
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:06,100
Listen, that you may not see you and Jessica
a woman here... March Èepmen?

310
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
This is not good enough.

311
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,600
Roger, I'm serious.

312
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,400
What is this, a joke?
- No, the cops are.

313
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,400
We are sorry that we could not
, to be of greater help.

314
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,500
If you find out anything about her,
call me, okay?

315
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,000
Okay.

316
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,300
Thank you.

317
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,000
Uhvatiæu it.

318
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,200
No!

319
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,800
Okay, leave it
out to play a little bit.

320
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Yes, we obuèili
time to clean up.

321
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,400
Okay, thank you.

322
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,400
Wait a minute. Now that you're already dressed,
how about dinner?

323
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:49,200
Nothing personal, but I do not think
can not remain there until breakfast.

324
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,100
Come on, Jessica.

325
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:59,600
Playful psiæu, you stay here.
You can not come, because you do not got a date.

326
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,300
I do not savaæe is anything I have bought.

327
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:08,500
This includes socks, T-shirts, chairs,
underwear and especially in my shoes.

328
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,000
If I catch and eat my shoes

329
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,800
then I called Roger to fit
just in your little nosiæ.

330
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,200
Come on!

331
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,500
Coming!

332
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,900
He's so cute.

333
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,200
Silver City Tavern

334
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,200
I just insisted that I go.

335
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,100
This is really cool. We get there,
and you have to go to Denver.

336
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,100
Come on, guys, this is not the end of the world.
We have a whole winter.

337
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:28,200
Rodz, is scientifically established that
too much sex can be a hazard to health.

338
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,100
Hey, you never get to interview miners
no employees.

339
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,900
But the truth is, too much sex can
blur vision, cause loss of coordination...

340
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,900
Yes.

341
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,200
Let's go already.

342
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,000
Food, food.
- Come on, come on.

343
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:14,000
When I saw that he could no longer eat,
then I ordered the wine.

344
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,500
My hero.

345
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,600
Listen to me, definitely tomorrow

346
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,300
we stop by the shop,
we must not lose beer.

347
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,800
It would not be the first time.

348
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,900
Svratiæemo then and there.

349
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,100
Food do you have?
- Yes.

350
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,900
You have a store here. People do not live on Indian
bread.

351
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,900
But as I saw it.

352
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,200
I thought I'd buy a few things...

353
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,100
You need for a
cake and tomorrow I'll make a cake.

354
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,500
Hey, I remember.

355
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,200
What?

356
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,600
Tomorrow will be the anniversary of your first orgasm.

357
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,400
Son of a bitch.
- Catch it!

358
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:43,900
Guess that patient!
We have it! Again!

359
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,200
Two goals!

360
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:52,900
Here we are.

361
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,600
Hey, boss.

362
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:55,200
Hi.

363
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:59,300
I want present to you my girl, sexy
Pennsylvania.

364
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:04,000
He's always been like this?
- Yes.

365
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,400
Guys, this is Trish.

366
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,100
Only Trish.

367
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,600
Well, would you beer?

368
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,300
No, no, no, keys,
go on the road for a couple of hours

369
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,500
I'll try to sleep, but
I do not think I'd make it.

370
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,200
me to go with you? - That would really like, but then the
sleep would not be anything.

371
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,800
Why do not you stay and we'll have fun
tomorrow night? - OK.

372
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,900
Drive carefully, fella.
It's gonna be iced.

373
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,300
I want. Thank you very much.
Adios.

374
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,800
See you Rodz.

375
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,600
Guys, know how to play pool?

376
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,600
Yes, a little.

377
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,100
A little?

378
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,900
Here.

379
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:01,700
Thank you.

380
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,200
Hey, I was working for the Post.

381
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,800
You have not talked to her about this hellish story about
mine and its history?

382
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:11,700
A, that, in
collapse we found human bones miners.

383
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:16,300
These are the most terrible mining disaster
events in local history.

384
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:18,100
This is already something.

385
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,900
Yes, a hell of a story.

386
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,000
Yes, thank you. 'll Check.

387
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,000
Whore!

388
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,400
The environment.

389
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,700
Damn! Have you seen it?

390
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:42,600
Impressed you?

391
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,200
Impressed? I'm angry, sad
I was kicked.

392
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,200
I have to tell you, guys,

393
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,800
I was very nervous when playing in cash.

394
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,700
So what do you say, Brian, heading towards?

395
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,800
OK.

396
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,600
Get them, Pennsylvania.

397
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,700
Okay, now you've gone too far!

398
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:51,600
Tigre?

399
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,600
Tigre?

400
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:01,300
Tigre?

401
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,500
I'd better hide.

402
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:13,600
Tigre?

403
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:24,700
Double or nothing.

404
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,600
Well, the money is yours.

405
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,900
Not for long.

406
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,000
OK, I'm playing.

407
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,800
Roger would liked this.
Revenge of the working class.

408
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:47,000
Tigre, you little shit, where are you?

409
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,600
Tigre?

410
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,000
Enough, Tiger!

411
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,600
Good, Tiger, you're screwed.

412
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:59,500
To stay hidden and not be found!

413
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,800
Hi, beautiful. Do you live here?

414
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,100
I'm the new girl in town.

415
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:48,500
I see you looking at me. Probably
've seen my face somewhere already, right.

416
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,200
I believe so.

417
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,200
Pretty face.

418
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,700
Embarrassed you?
- No.

419
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:04,400
No, I always react this way when I feel that I
catch up with this profoundly depressing, self-pitying.

420
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:05,700
I see.

421
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,600
This happens often?

422
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:12,800
Only when I am afraid that I will
a beautiful young girl down.

423
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,600
There is a chance for that.

424
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,500
Do you already said you were a
you a beautiful young woman?

425
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,800
And did you say that you have beautiful eyes
?

426
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,400
I got that cute nosiæ?

427
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:32,800
I got that sexy lips?

428
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,800
All this you have already said?

429
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,900
Unfortunately, I feel that again
crashing into a deep depression self-pity.

430
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:42,400
Please do not stop now.
I love to hear the old compliments.

431
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,600
I have not stopped. They just ran out of compliments
.

432
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:50,200
Oh, I know. How about an old
soft music to me? It's good for you?

433
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,000
And here is the beautiful music.

434
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,800
Oh, yes.

435
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,000
Oh, I know already. I know already.
Old moonlight still works.

436
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:00,700
Snowing.

437
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,000
Okay, okay... snow.

438
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,400
How about...

439
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:14,500
How about an old-fashioned romantic
fire in the fireplace?

440
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:18,300
An old-fashioned romantic fire in the fireplace?

441
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,100
My favorite.

442
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,100
I have a fireplace for you.

443
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:25,700
Prove it!

444
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,700
Jess, we must go back to the ranch.

445
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:35,700
Thank God. You could not get a
another game. I would be embarrassed.

446
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:41,300
Wait a minute, that there is money
my son for lunch.

447
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:42,700
Gambling is a sin.

448
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,900
Come on, give him a chance to equate
.

449
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:46,600
After that we'll take.

450
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,100
OK.

451
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:53,100
We'll have money for tomorrow's dinner.
- OK.

452
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:53,800
Hi.

453
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:54,900
See you, guys.
- Goodbye.

454
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,200
Points.

455
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,800
Shit!

456
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,400
Damn.

457
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,400
Fuck.

458
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,000
Tigre?

459
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:51,700
Fuck you!

460
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:14,600
You better not hide, you'll get tomorrow
certainly Tigre.

461
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,300
What the hell?

462
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:00,900
Jesus.

463
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,700
But it's true.

464
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,800
No, it can not be.

465
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:30,700
This is more like it.

466
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,900
Can I get you anything before
than light a fire?

467
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:38,600
Yes.

468
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,500
God, I like your eyes.

469
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,800
No, no, no. My name is Mark.
God's the guy with the huge beard...

470
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:47,200
I're funny.

471
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,000
I'm not that bad, you know.

472
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:57,500
Where is he?

473
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:01,200
Probably started sooner,
because of the snow.

474
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,900
the bed.

475
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:08,200
So... Now where were we?

476
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,100
Right here.

477
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,100
Sorry...

478
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:12,200
I scared you?

479
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,900
No, no, no. It's okay.
I did not think you were awake.

480
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,300
I have not slept a good thing.
Have not seen Tiger?

481
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,500
Well, we almost had
"Manaz and it" last night.

482
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,000
I have not seen him since.

483
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,700
So, you did not let him out?
- No. Why?

484
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:30,000
Not sleep in bed with me last night
and I could not find any this morning.

485
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:35,200
Well, already late for work,
let's go look for him.

486
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:26,300
Tigre?

487
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,500
There you are. What were you doing there?
Come.

488
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,200
Shakes.

489
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,700
We must have scared
last night when we yelled at him.

490
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
I do not know.

491
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,600
Hey, listen. I have to go to work.

492
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,900
Hey, what do you think of her?
Do not Trish special?

493
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:00,500
Very poebna.

494
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,100
I'm glad you like it.

495
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,800
Hey, I really need to go.

496
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,900
Hey, do not forget:
èokoladna cake tonight! - Great, I'll see you later.

497
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,800
Maybe it was vandals, I guess.

498
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:23,300
Vandals? Pretty weird from vandals.

499
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,600
Hey, are you done some more damage?
Truck, some of mine?

500
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:27,800
Do not look like that.

501
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:30,700
This is another strange thing.
We have a lot of radio in the truck,

502
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,300
mostly on the go,
but they did not not even touched.

503
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:36,400
Well, someone should keep an eye on the generator,
to avoid problems later.

504
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,600
It costs 5-600 dollars.

505
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:39,400
Or 1,000.

506
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,300
Yes.

507
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,800
Well, as we said
they were vandals, that's all.

508
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:44,600
Pretty weird  by vandals.

509
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,200
Damn weird from vandals.

510
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,300
Remind me not to budge.

511
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:09,000
Are you finished with the bathroom?
- Yes.

512
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,100
Well, it's pretty clean for mountain
girls and miners.

513
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,600
Good.
Two hours I need.

514
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:18,000
What this great store?

515
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:20,900
Right to Let us not budgets.

516
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:24,900
Oh, yes.

517
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,300
It smells great.

518
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:31,300
Happy coming home.

519
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,400
I would join.

520
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:40,100
're Not even thinking about getting married?
- I hand over this bizarre connection?

521
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:42,300
Seriously.

522
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,400
Could you imagine Roger as a father?

523
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:49,300
No.

524
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,500
Probably our children were mischievous little brats

525
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:55,000
who would drink beer all day.
No, thank you.

526
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,700
You made the list?
- Yes, there is on the table.

527
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,500
Good. Svratiæu to the grocery store as soon as
I ended up in the office.

528
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,600
I really want to write about the mine?

529
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:10,700
At least I will have a press kit.
If you forget something, call me.

530
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:12,900
OK.

531
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:14,700
Hey, thanks for the bathroom.

532
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:16,400
Bye-bye.
- Hi.

533
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,200
I worked at the Post.

534
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:45,300
Seriously?

535
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:49,100
Yes, in 1953. year.
In 1953. and 1954's.

536
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:50,200
Really?

537
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:54,900
The extension.
I was the first raznosaèica newspaper.

538
01:02:56,200 --> 01:03:00,800
You know I could write about this topic:
First raznosaèica newspaper in Denver.

539
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,400
Yes, this sounds fascinating.
It'll definitely remember.

540
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:06,600
It was a summer in 1953.

541
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,400
A Articles Resources on mine?

542
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,900
O, that erosion.

543
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,800
How's it going, guys?
- Great.

544
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:42,100
What are you doing?
- I want to take some samples.

545
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:45,000
Before you come from a surveillance...

546
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:47,600
I'll send some samples to Denver for analysis.

547
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:51,800
I want to ask you something about
these bones.

548
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:53,100
Yes, what about them?

549
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:58,200
If these died from gas or
because of lack of air, or from hunger...

550
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:02,800
Their skeletons should be separated,
rather than a pile of bones.

551
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:08,500
Yes, you're right, this is really weird.

552
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:11,300
OK, we're done with this.

553
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:14,400
Roger would ever need to return.

554
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:20,400
I want to call the office and ask
when he was there.

555
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:24,000
We need the maps should
work in these tunnels afternoon.

556
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:26,600
I am sure that there are no problems
, otherwise the call.

557
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,200
Well, you certainly find out!

558
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:29,300
OK.

559
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,000
Come on.

560
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:09,400
Come on, do not give me a hard job.

561
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:12,100
Now this is more like it already.

562
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:01,500
They wrote a lot of stories about
these collapses.

563
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,200
What is this?

564
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:08,000
Lieutenant in the U.S. Army limo
was sent from Denver

565
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:10,400
spasilaèku to lead the operation.

566
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:14,900
But by the time he arrived on Tuesday, anyway...
Rescue camp was abandoned...

567
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:18,200
This is weird...

568
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:20,400
Do not write why they broke up with a rescue.

569
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:25,100
Why did I tell you that in this day and age
write worse. This should see.

570
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:26,600
Listen to this.

571
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:32,900
Suspect that it was done by a miner named
Harold Griswold, who caused the tragedy.

572
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:38,200
Griswold was the only man who survived the collapse of
,

573
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:41,800
But was not able to testify in court on
accident in a mine...

574
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,500
Remanded to hospital for mental health problems
.

575
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:50,600
Why would a man mad?

576
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:57,400
Hello?

577
01:06:57,500 --> 01:07:00,800
Yes. It's for you.
A girl by the name of Jessica.

578
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Thank you.

579
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:18,500
Hi!
- Hi! You look like a real miner.

580
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,700
What's going on, huh?

581
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,100
So, what's up?

582
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:28,600
I do not know.
Roger had problems with the car or something?

583
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:29,900
Why?

584
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:33,500
Well, I've spoken to Jess, she looked
garage and pick there.

585
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:34,500
Brian's pick?

586
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:37,300
Yes, I do. Roger's with the
should go to Denver.

587
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,400
Came back? It's already
to come back now.

588
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,300
I do not know. I mean, I,
we have not heard about it.

589
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:46,700
I'm talking now with the Denver office,
but Roger has not appeared there.

590
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:51,600
Do you think he had the accident on the road?
- On With what? The car in front of his house.

591
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:53,500
Might be stopped.

592
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,800
Roger did not want to go so
in Denver.

593
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,200
This is really weird.

594
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:01,000
Yes.

595
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:02,900
Do you want to hear something else weird?

596
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:08,000
Well, I was in the office of the press
by some articles of the collapse.

597
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:13,500
I one of the miners actually pulled,
and said that they were attacked.

598
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:15,700
Attacked?

599
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:16,700
Yes.

600
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:19,900
Supposed to testify here in Denver

601
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:23,500
but totally freaked out, went crazy,
after he was transferred to a mental hospital.

602
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:28,100
This does not seem to have much sense.
- A lot of things now, so it seems.

603
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:33,000
Listen, I want to now go back to the
Jessica, right?

604
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:36,500
'll Talk with Brian,
I'll see if he can let me go early.

605
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:37,900
Okay, great.

606
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:41,500
I have to stop and pick up some groceries.
What do I say?

607
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:46,600
Tell her I'll find out what's going on,
and tell her not to worry.

608
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:47,700
OK.

609
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:49,500
And do not you worry.

610
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:52,900
See you soon.

611
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:45,300
Hey!

612
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:49,200
Where are the rest of the bags?
Need for samples.

613
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:52,300
Got there a couple.

614
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:54,500
OK. Pogledaæu.

615
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:15,300
Oh, shut up.

616
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:47,100
Tigre?

617
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:05,100
Tigre?

618
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:34,400
What hell are you doing?
- Any of something in the water.

619
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,200
Come on, you're imagining things.

620
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:40,600
Not imagining anything.
Something floating there.

621
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:00,900
You reach?

622
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:02,300
Yet.

623
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:16,300
What the hell?
- I do not know, but it's stuck.

624
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:23,500
God!

625
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:26,300
This is Roger!

626
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:28,000
My God.

627
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:30,700
Jesus Christ, look at his face.

628
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:37,900
Well, get it.

629
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:52,300
This is the young man who
work for you, right?

630
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:54,500
Who's there?

631
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:57,700
You could not leave them alone
, is not it?

632
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,200
You had to set them free.

633
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:03,100
Who are you to hell?

634
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:05,600
I warned you.

635
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:07,100
Warned?

636
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:09,800
Damn.

637
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:14,400
You've set the damn cross?

638
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:21,300
Now we have to close them again,
is not it?

639
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,700
What are you, the hell you talking about?

640
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:29,200
You let them come out.

641
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:31,800
And now we have to close it again.

642
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Hey, what are you doing?

643
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:34,100
Hey, Mark!

644
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,600
Your friend... is dead.

645
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:48,100
Jesus.

646
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:55,200
But Roger was at home.

647
01:17:56,700 --> 01:17:58,200
The mine was closed.

648
01:17:59,000 --> 01:17:59,700
How is it possible...

649
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:03,200
These tunnels
water everywhere under the city.

650
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:05,300
They are associated with the home.

651
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,200
Your explosion freed them.

652
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:13,300
Popeæe through tunnels and
uhvatiæe them.

653
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:14,700
Through the tunnels?

654
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:17,700
Tunnel to the house.

655
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:19,700
Girls!

656
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:21,800
Go get them!
You go get them!

657
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Come on, for God's sake,
go get them.

658
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:29,800
I bring some help, hurry up!

659
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:42,200
They are...

660
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:50,100
They closed my father...
An asylum, after the great collapse.

661
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:58,100
No one did not believe him.

662
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:04,500
I would check out the
tunnels over the years.

663
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:07,600
To make sure they are well sealed
.

664
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:12,100
I checked and tunnels
at home, too.

665
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:20,100
Yes, I'm sure this can be solved somehow
.

666
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:22,800
That was my job.

667
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:31,300
Well, you see, we we want to help you
.

668
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:33,500
Do not you, Dan?
- Yes.

669
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:38,400
You see, we we want to help you in your job
, if only...

670
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:39,500
No!

671
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:41,200
No!

672
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:45,200
You opened the tunnels,
you let them come out.

673
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:51,000
You have not listened to my warnings, I
I have to close them again explosion.

674
01:19:58,600 --> 01:19:59,600
Den!

675
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:02,400
Den!

676
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:11,200
Monsters!

677
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:20,500
My God, is returning to!

678
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:22,000
Back!

679
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,300
We have to stop him!

680
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:09,300
For Christ's sake, answer the damn phone
!

681
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:20,200
Yes, operator, give me
sheriff's office. It's an emergency.

682
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:24,500
Jessica!

683
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:27,700
Jess?

684
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:41,700
Jessica?

685
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:22,300
Jessica?

686
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:11,800
Jessica!

687
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:46,300
O God!

688
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:49,200
God!

689
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:49,800
Jessica!

690
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:55,600
Jesus!

691
01:26:57,100 --> 01:26:58,100
Jessica !

692
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:13,900
Trish!

693
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:32,100
That's it! That's it!
Take it easy!

694
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:35,000
'll Be all right.

695
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:37,700
It's...

696
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:38,700
Jessica's dead.

697
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:39,300
What?

698
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:42,700
Jesus.

699
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:47,400
What is this hell?

700
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,700
Whatever it is, it's probably
attacked Roger at the mine.

701
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:51,800
Roger?

702
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:54,000
Roger is dead.

703
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:56,700
O God, what is happening...

704
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:00,800
This is najèudnija
damn thing I've ever seen.

705
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:56,700
Mark!

706
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:05,700
No, Jessica...

707
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:07,300
For it already is nothing we can do!

708
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,700
Good,
could explode at any moment.

709
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:19,000
No, no. Do not worry, come on.

710
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:22,900
Do you know where we are? - Yes, this is
connects to the main tunnel.

711
01:30:23,300 --> 01:30:24,600
OK. Just be careful.

712
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,600
Mark!

713
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:50,800
Come on! Get out of here!

714
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,100
Brian, slowly, slowly.
It'll be all right.

715
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:13,900
There's more.

716
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,100
Okay, okay, we're almost out
. - There's more.

717
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:20,500
We need to blow up and shut
this damn place.

718
01:31:20,700 --> 01:31:21,800
What I'm saying?

719
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:24,900
Dan is dead, and the old man.

720
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:28,700
Izveæu you out.
We'll all get out!

721
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:33,100
Dynamite, take the dynamite.
There is back.

722
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:35,900
We have to close this damn mine.
Come on!

723
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:43,900
Stay close to us,
in case.

724
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:46,700
Just in case.

725
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:50,500
Hurry!

726
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:54,700
Hurry!

727
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:26,000
No, no, no. It's okay.

728
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:29,600
Done. We stopped them.

729
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Come on.
