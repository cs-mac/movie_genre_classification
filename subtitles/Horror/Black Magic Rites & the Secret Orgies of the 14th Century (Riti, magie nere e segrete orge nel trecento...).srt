18
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.770
Older Bro Fei!

19
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.840
Zhan Xiong Fei!

20
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.170
Who was it?

21
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.040
Who was the one who interfered?!

22
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.330
I'll go check right away.

23
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.110
Xiong Fei!

24
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.200
Older Bro Fei!

25
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.240
- Xiong Fei!
- Zhan Xiong Fei!

26
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.760
Xiong Fei! Are you alright?

27
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.330
Weren't you just pierced by a sword?

28
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.310
I'm fine.

29
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.150
Everything that happened were just illusions.

30
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.710
Where is Zi Su?

31
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:54.910
How come Zi Su disappeared?

32
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.200
Where is Zi Su?

33
00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.570
Men Luo?

34
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.020
Who are you?

35
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.530
This is Lady Hong Yu.

36
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.070
It was she who saved all of you today.

37
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.760
For a long time, just to decrease the sins of Black Dragon,

38
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.920
Lady Hong Yu has been persistently asking for forgiveness from the deities everyday for him.

39
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.650
But this type of prayer causes a severe countercharge on her.

40
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.960
Lady Hong Yu's health has already deteriorated badly.

41
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.750
I've also urged her multiple times

42
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.120
but she just won't listen.

43
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.930
I know that things that Lady Hong Yu has decided on

44
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.310
can never be changed by anyone.

45
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.450
Countercharge prayers?

46
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.580
Every person has their own fate.

47
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.860
This maybe is my fate.

48
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.060
Just to save you all, Lady Hong Yu

49
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.060
risked her own life.

50
00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.430
Today, she used her own blood to complete this prayer.

51
00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.520
I hope that you all will not disappoint her.

52
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.000
You'd better hurry and escape.

53
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.640
I've already arranged it. Go with Men Luo to get the Magic Stars

54
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.080
and then leave Mystical Dragon Fortress, leave Clouds Harbor.

55
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.400
Go as far away from here as possible.

56
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.860
Zi Su isn't back yet.

57
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.090
- We definitely can't leave on our own.
- Yes.

58
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.280
You guys just leave.

59
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.490
Just leave me here.

60
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.150
- No way.
- I'll take Zi Su away from here.

61
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.460
Older Bro Fei, how can we allow that?

62
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.550
Hurry up and leave.

63
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.870
With Lady Hong Yu here,

64
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.660
nothing will happen to Zi Su.

65
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.930
Bai Ze, take Yuan Shuai and A Ji Ya and escape.

66
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.940
- No.
- Believe me!

67
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.730
I will definitely bring Zi Su back.

68
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.140
Hurry and go! Hurry and go!

69
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.420
Yuan Shuai and A Ji Ya! Come with me!

70
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.220
Come with me!

71
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.030
Be careful, Older Bro Fei.

72
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.320
Why won't you leave?

73
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.750
Don't urge me.

74
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.400
As long as Zi Su is still here,

75
00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:49.800
I will never leave.

76
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.240
Don't be stupid anymore.

77
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.990
Although Zi Su is your friend,

78
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.460
she has demon exterminator blood flowing inside her.

79
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.780
The demonic imprint in your body is currently spreading.

80
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.370
This demonic aura will stimulate the murderous innate nature inside her.

81
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.290
I don't believe it! I don't believe Zi Su will become some demon exterminator.

82
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.820
Stop being stupid already.

83
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.870
It's not worthy for you to risk your life for this.

84
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.410
I already told you, I don't believe it!

85
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.110
Zi Su is Zi Su. I...

86
00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.920
I don't know why she'd kill me, but...

87
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.860
I know that she's a kind person.

88
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.340
I also know that she's a person who'd rather risk her own life

89
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.510
than kill anyone.

90
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.380
That's why all those things earlier must have been...

91
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.600
must have been some hallucinations for her.

92
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.520
It's impossible for her to kill me.

93
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.300
How do you want me to say it so you'll believe me?

94
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.250
Hurry and leave. It's not worth it to lose your life over this.

95
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.580
So what?!

96
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.080
Listen to my advice. In this world, there are really a lot of things

97
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.510
that we can't control.

98
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.490
You're urging me to leave.

99
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.570
Why don't you leave?

100
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.280
I'm different from you.

101
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.720
Zi Su will kill you,

102
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.970
but Black Dragon King won't kill me.

103
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.710
Indeed, Black Dragon King won't kill you,

104
00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.570
but for him, you take those countercharges.

105
00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.400
What's the difference between that and my current situation?

106
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.310
We're both the same.

107
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.280
You can't bear to leave Black Dragon King.

108
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.600
I can't bear to leave Zi Su.

109
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.310
You're willing to give your life for Black Dragon King.

110
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.530
I am also willing to be killed by Zi Su.

111
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.620
The Heaven destined Zi Su to be a demon exterminator.

112
00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.360
Then I'll be a demon that'll be killed by her!

113
00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.060
Good.

114
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.930
I'll fulfill your wish.

115
00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:35.540
Zi Su.

116
00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.290
Zi Su, kill him.

117
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.290
Complete your first test in becoming a true demon exterminator.

118
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:47.490
Stop it now.

119
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.020
The sins you've committed are already too much.

120
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.020
I don't need you to mind my business!

121
00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.080
Defending the righteousness in this world is my lifetime's duty.

122
00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.500
Wake up.

123
00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.290
Your heart has already been blinded.

124
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.800
Zi Su, kill him!

125
00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.440
Zi Su.

126
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.340
Zi Su, don't.

127
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.090
Zi Su!

128
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.720
Zi Su!

129
00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:59.690
Zi Su,

130
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.180
is everything really like what he said...

131
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.110
unchangeable?

132
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:18.660
Just do it.

133
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.730
I'm willing.

134
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:25.230
Don't you have any other words to ask me?

135
00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.270
None.

136
00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.610
Don't you want to know...

137
00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:35.350
if I kill you,

138
00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.650
whether or not I'll be sad?

139
00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:43.820
The reason that you don't ask

140
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.100
is because you're afraid that if you ask me,

141
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.850
I'll become sadder instead.

142
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:55.980
Zi Su...

143
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.870
I hope that you can forget me.

144
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.400
What will make you let go?!

145
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:11.590
I'm begging you. You've already killed so many people. A lot of people have already died.

146
00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.330
When will you stop?!

147
00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.370
Don't you feel any bit of remorse?

148
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.970
Why would I feel remorse?

149
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.380
Because you can't take other people's lives.

150
00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:25.710
You also shouldn't take away Zi Su's inner heart!

151
00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.620
You don't understand anything.

152
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.790
This isn't called taking away. This is bestowing.

153
00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:35.280
Zi Su is the strongest demon exterminator descendant chosen by Heaven.

154
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.170
My duty is to help her grow.

155
00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:42.130
Everything that I've been doing wasn't for myself.

156
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.480
You keep saying that it was for Zi Su...

157
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:49.070
but you clearly know that Zi Su doesn't like killing.

158
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.860
Zi Su! Do it!

159
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:21.290
<i>If one day, I really change</i>

160
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.070
<i>and will do something that hurts you,</i>

161
00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:25.620
<i>you must leave me.</i>

162
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.550
<i>You must protect yourself well.</i>

163
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.050
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

164
00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:30.890
<i>What do you mean?</i>

165
00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:33.600
<i>I don't care. Just promise me first.</i>

166
00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:35.390
<i>Uh, okay, I promise you.</i>

167
00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:37.480
<i>Okay, pinky promise.</i>

168
00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:40.390
<i>Okay.</i>

169
00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.140
Let him go!

170
00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.090
Zi Su, what are you doing?

171
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.720
Are you siding with the demons?

172
00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:11.620
Zi Su...

173
00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:13.800
Zhan Xiong Fei isn't a demon!

174
00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.240
Can't you see the demon mark in his body?

175
00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:20.780
He'll soon lose his human traits and become a demon!

176
00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:27.450
I don't care about demons.

177
00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:30.720
I just know that every living thing is equal.

178
00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:33.520
No one is born to be killed by another one.

179
00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:38.030
You taking pity on him now will cause miseries for a lot of other people in the future.

180
00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.490
You're going against the decree of the gods.

181
00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:45.520
If killing can save everything in the world,

182
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:48.530
then what's the use of revering those kinds of gods?!

183
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:50.110
Full of lies!

184
00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:51.590
Kill him!

185
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.160
You can then become a real demon exterminator.

186
00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:57.350
When that time comes, you'll understand everything.

187
00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:00.370
Zhan Xiong Fei, let's go.

188
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:07.000
Be careful!

189
00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:43.710
Hong Yu! Hong Yu!

190
00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:51.950
Hong Yu!

191
00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:55.710
Hong Yu!

192
00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.090
Don't kill people anymore.

193
00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.220
Be careful.

194
00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:34.880
Give that to him to take in.

195
00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.060
As a demon exterminator,

196
00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.210
I don't know if it's right or wrong,

197
00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:49.880
but I was wrong.

198
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:17.670
Hong Yu, let's not separate anymore.

199
00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:42.480
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Magic Stars Team @ Viki.com</i>

200
00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:49.020
Men Luo said that those two Magic Stars are just hidden in the main throne room.

201
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:50.530
Let's go.

202
00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:25.370
- Golden Magic Star!
- I found the Crimson Red Magic Star.

203
00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.650
Then we've found two now!

204
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:29.300
That's right.

205
00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:59.140
Don't run!

206
00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.730
A Ji Ya, are you alright?

207
00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.960
Sorry. I still lost the Crimson Red Magic Star.

208
00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.320
It's fine. Good thing there is still a Golden Magic Star in my hand.

209
00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:14.470
Let's hurry and find Old Bro Fei and Zi Su.

210
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:15.940
Let's go.

211
00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:29.470
Dragon King, Lady Hong Yu,

212
00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:33.320
rest in peace!

213
00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:38.030
I'll frequently visit you two.

214
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:42.210
Dragon King!

215
00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:55.050
Hurry and take this medicine in.

216
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:56.770
It can cure the wound on your forearm.

217
00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:01.650
But... is this Black Dragon King's medicine... really reliable?

218
00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:03.060
That's right.

219
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.800
A person that's dying will surely say the truth.

220
00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.100
I feel that the Black Dragon King also had a conscience.

221
00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.030
This medication is most likely safe.

222
00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.420
Xiong Fei, why don't you give it a try?

223
00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.200
- Just try it.
- Treating a dead horse like a live one*.
 (* Do all means to revive a hopeless case).

224
00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.390
Right now, it's also our last chance.

225
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:23.800
Go and give it a try.

226
00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.600
That also sounds reasonable.

227
00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:30.000
Look. The wound on your forearm is getting worse.

228
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Go give it a try.

229
00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:36.010
- Then... I'm taking it in.
- Yes.

230
00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.100
- How do you feel?
- How was it? Is it effective?

231
00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.200
Xiong Fei! Xiong Fei!

232
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.400
- Older Bro Fei! Don't scare me!
- Xiong Fei! Zhan Xiong Fei!

233
00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.000
Xiong Fei!

234
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.680
- Older Bro Fei!
- Xiong Fei!

235
00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.800
- Xiong Fei!
- Zhang Xiong Fei!

236
00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.130
- Don't leave me alone!
- Xiong Fei!

237
00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:04.400
- Xiong Fei!
- Older Bro Fei!
- Xiong Fei!

238
00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.400
- Hey!
- Older Bro Fei!

239
00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.300
- Xiong Fei...
- Zi Su,

240
00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.700
- hurry. Hurry and take a look at him. Hurry.
- Don't leave me alone.

241
00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.400
Hey, why are you like that?!

242
00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.200
- I scared you all, didn't I?
- I just know it.

243
00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.250
I'm not a dead horse.

244
00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:21.200
- I'm a live horse.
- It really is cured.

245
00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.600
- I just knew that you were alright.
- It's fine now!

246
00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.600
Why are you all here?

247
00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.400
Weren't you the people I saw in your room earlier?

248
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.000
Could it be Granddaddy?

249
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.700
Granddaddy went to buy food.

250
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.400
- Let's take a look. 
- Let's go and see.

251
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.200
Hey! Who are you?!

252
00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.000
Hey! What are you doing?!

253
00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:50.100
Don't run! Don't run!

254
00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.200
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry and take a look!

255
00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.500
Look at it.

256
00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.400
It's still here. Good thing that it's still here.

257
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.200
Where is Wen Xuan?

258
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.620
Didn't he chase after him?

259
00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:06.500
He went after him!

260
00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.600
Go! Hurry and go!

261
00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.800
Wait for me!

262
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:11.910
Don't run!

263
00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:13.400
Stop right there!

264
00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.910
Stop! Don't run!

265
00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:18.300
Stop!

266
00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.800
Wen Xuan!

267
00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.800
Wen Xuan! Wen Xuan!

268
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.200
Wen Xuan!

269
00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:46.000
Wen Xuan!

270
00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:54.100
Wen Xuan! Wen Xuan!

271
00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:00.900
<i>[Yanjiao Town]</i>

272
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.900
- Stop! You can't leave!
- You can't leave!

273
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Hey, lady. Just you alone? Where are you going this time?

274
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
What are you planning to do?

275
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.800
Little lady, don't be afraid.

276
00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:36.900
Look at our appearances and you'll know that we're good people.

277
00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:43.800
We just want to invite you to go to the mountains. Eat and chat with us.

278
00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.200
Be your friend.

279
00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.000
Later, we'll bring you back here.

280
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000
Will you be true to your words?

281
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.200
Of course, they are true.

282
00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.600
Fine then. I'll just visit for a short time.

283
00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.800
Later, let me go first. I was the first one to block her.

284
00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.800
It was clearly me who first saw her.

285
00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.400
If not because I suggested that we take this road, how could we have encountered such a good thing?

286
00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.800
- I should still be the first one to do it.
- Stop arguing already.

287
00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.800
- Let's all just do it all together.
- Sure.

288
00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.400
What are you talking about?! Are we leaving or not?

289
00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.600
Let's go. Let's go.

290
00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.800
Go. Go. Go. Okay.

291
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:24.600
You tell me.  Did we go to Clouds Harbor just for leisure?

292
00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:28.800
We've went in circles but never found anything. How come we came back here?

293
00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:33.400
Don't forget. I didn't come for the Magic Stars this time.

294
00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.200
And we keep not finding that Golden Magic Star.

295
00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.800
Fighting with those kids isn't my style, either.

296
00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:42.570
Why not just look for a place and rest for a while?

297
00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:47.200
Rest? Do you... you want to go home?

298
00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.800
I'll go with you. Where is your home?

299
00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.400
Don't ask things that you shouldn't ask.

300
00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.400
Boss! Boss!

301
00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.400
Boss, you're still alive? You actually didn't die?

302
00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.600
How come you're here?

303
00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.000
You and those other guys

304
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.090
went out looking for some gold.

305
00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:01.800
Yet after you left, we weren't able to get any news about you.

306
00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:02.950
Leaving just four of us to guard this place.

307
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:04.280
We all thought you were dead.

308
00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.900
- We even made you a tomb.
- What?

309
00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:08.400
You... You keep saying unlucky words. Where are they?

310
00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.470
We actually came down the mountain planning to get some food.

311
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:12.600
Never thought we would encounter a shrew lady.

312
00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.690
In the end...

313
00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:16.300
Stop! Stop!

314
00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:18.800
What shrew lady? What shrew lady?

315
00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.910
Hey, you. If you don't offend her, will she hit you?

316
00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:23.000
Moreover, you're four big men but were unable to defeat a woman.

317
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.700
And you still say that you are under me?! And you still say that you are under me?!

318
00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:29.000
Where did this shrew lady come from?

319
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.120
Where are the three of them?

320
00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:31.400
Let's go look for them. Find them.

321
00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.900
They are there!

322
00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:40.990
Boss is here! Boss is here!

323
00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:42.000
Boss!

324
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.400
Boss! Boss! We're here!

325
00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.720
Boss...

326
00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.000
Boss... Boss...

327
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Shut up!

328
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.580
You tell me. You useless kinds, being scared to this state by some woman...

329
00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:57.900
Don't dare say that you are with me from now on!

330
00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.800
- She was great.
- Boss,

331
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.660
where have you been all this time?

332
00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:04.200
We missed you a lot!

333
00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.870
Boss, now that you're back, let's gather our brothers again.

334
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:08.400
We can surely return to our glorious days.

335
00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.000
And then, find that bitch and make her pay!

336
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.400
Right. Right. Find her and make her pay!

337
00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.610
Which bitch?

338
00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:15.200
What is her name?

339
00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:20.000
In the whole 50 mile radius of Yanjiao Town, I have never heard of such a strong woman.

340
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.100
Her name is...

341
00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:27.600
I think that you all know this person.

342
00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:31.900
If I didn't guess it wrong, she is the Lady Boss of Casual Guests' Inn.

343
00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.070
Huang Qian Xun? Huang Qian Xun!

344
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:39.400
This thing is easy. I know her very well.

345
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.200
I'll just talk to her and this thing is solved. It is solved.

346
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.320
Talk to her? What are you saying?

347
00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.400
We're not using force? Just talking?

348
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.550
You useless things have followed me for so long yet you haven't improved at all.

349
00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:51.300
Just knowing to kill and use force everyday.

350
00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:55.500
You guys should know to present the facts and be reasonable.

351
00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:57.090
Let them go. Listen to me. I make the decisions.

352
00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:58.300
Let them go!

353
00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.400
Okay. Okay.

354
00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:07.200
Granddaddy misses you! Wen Xuan!

355
00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:13.000
Come back!

356
00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:22.540
Wen Xuan! Come back!

357
00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:25.400
Come back!

358
00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:33.400
Granddaddy misses you, Wen Xuan...

359
00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.870
<i>Come back...</i>

360
00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:41.700
<i>Come back, my good grandson.</i>

361
00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.570
<i>Wen Xuan...</i>

362
00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:51.300
Come back! Wen Xuan!

363
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:58.200
I really can't understand why there must be so many killings in this world.

364
00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:02.500
Can't people just co-exist peacefully?

365
00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:08.000
<i>Sometimes, I really want to just stay at Clouds Village.</i>

366
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.710
<i>Live a very simple life.</i>

367
00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:13.000
Stay far from the wars of the world.

368
00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:19.800
One day, this world will become like Clouds Village,

369
00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.700
peaceful and harmonious.

370
00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:29.800
<i>Come back! Wen Xuan...</i>

371
00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:35.000
Come back! My good grandson...

372
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.300
Mister Ma, why are you here?

373
00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:01.100
Don't be afraid. I am already not a Big Boss.

374
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.100
So eerily silent. Not one person at all?

375
00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:11.000
A few days ago, didn't Lady Boss go out for a long travel?

376
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000
You know that she's the signature of this inn.

377
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.600
When she was not around, our business got stolen by others.

378
00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.000
Where did she go?

379
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.600
This I don't know.

380
00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.000
Mister Ma! Mister Ma!

381
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.900
- Painful...
- Where did she go?

382
00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:36.000
At the backyard. At the backyard...

383
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:47.200
I'm dead! I'm dead!

384
00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:29.000
Yo, Lord Qian, you're here.

385
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.900
Where is she?

386
00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.800
At the back...

387
00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.900
Good thing. I'm sharing it with you.

388
00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:15.420
Ma Da Dao, you actually peep on people taking a bath, right?

389
00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:16.940
Who is there?

390
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:19.960
You are so useless!

391
00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.700
What are you doing?!

392
00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:24.700
You two were peeping on me while I'm taking a bath!

393
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.060
Don't misunderstand.

394
00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:31.000
It really wasn't me.

395
00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:40.700
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Magic Stars Team @ Viki.com</i>

396
00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.230
Does he still  not want to eat anything?

397
00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.800
Granddaddy won't eat anything.

398
00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.410
Granddaddy is already old.

399
00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:51.460
Wen Xuan just left like that.

400
00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:53.800
How can he be in any mood to eat?

401
00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.660
Not just Granddaddy,

402
00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:58.800
even I don't have any appetite.

403
00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.300
But he can't stay like that.

404
00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.210
We must find Dark Shadow Man.

405
00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:06.900
This way, we can comfort Wen Xuan's soul.

406
00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:14.000
Butler Men Luo already said that despite staying by Black Dragon King for so many years, he still doesn't fully know him.

407
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.900
Right now, the Crimson Red Magic Star was taken by him.

408
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.260
But good thing that the Golden Magic Star is in our hands.

409
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:26.800
That's why Dark Shadow Man definitely won't stop.

410
00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:30.010
As long as the Golden Magic Star is still in our hands, he'll definitely come to find us.

411
00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:32.600
What we need to do now is to stay here and take care of Granddaddy.

412
00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:35.700
About that time, he'll surely come to find us on his own.

413
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.500
I definitely want to seek revenge for Wen Xuan.

414
00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:44.400
You tell me, the way you handled this thing is...

415
00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.800
We've already agreed to share any good thing.

416
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.380
Why did you have to over react?

417
00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:52.400
Now, it's just good. None of us can see it anymore.

418
00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.150
Do you even have the nerve to scold me?

419
00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:57.200
You were there peeping on other people while they took a bath. Doing such despicable thing!

420
00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.400
What nonsense are you saying?

421
00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:00.920
She's pretty that's why I looked.

422
00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:03.000
If she's not, why would I look?

423
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.200
So captivating, do you know that?

424
00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.800
It was actually first time that I felt that way when peeping on women.

425
00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.260
My mouth and tongue went dry.

426
00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:12.800
My heartbeat increased.

427
00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:14.240
Enough already!

428
00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:18.000
Let me be honest with you. I have more interactions with her.

429
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.410
This person definitely isn't that simple as she looks.

430
00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:24.000
You have to think about it well.

431
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.120
Of course, I already thought about it well.

432
00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:28.200
I definitely must woo her to be mine.

433
00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:32.600
If I continue to be single like this, I would delay having a child. Understand?

434
00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:37.090
Fine. Since I've already said what I should say,

435
00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:39.400
yet you still want to do that,

436
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.510
then I'll help you once.

437
00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:43.100
Let's go.

438
00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:47.820
Did you... you change your mind?

439
00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:50.140
Let me tell you. We must not enter there now.

440
00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:52.490
Because of the scene you made earlier, she's currently very vigilant.

441
00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:55.110
She wasn't on guard earlier but because of you, now...

442
00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:56.630
Let me tell you. You should slightly wait for a while.

443
00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:59.630
Let her lower down her guard.

444
00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:02.380
You want to peep on her taking a bath again?!

445
00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:04.800
We should find a place to stay first, right?

446
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.040
Just know to peep on others while they take a bath.

447
00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:36.790
How was it?

448
00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:38.320
Granddaddy took his medications earlier.

449
00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.350
He's now asleep.

450
00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:42.950
If only we got there sooner.

451
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:44.760
Don't blame yourself anymore.

452
00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:47.630
Oh, no! Oh, no!

453
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:50.160
I saw a ghost-like thing earlier! Oh, wrong, wrong.

454
00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:51.910
It's a ghost that looks like Wen Xuan lying at the city entrance.

455
00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:53.860
Let's go take a look.

456
00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:57.120
Wen Xuan! Wen Xuan...

457
00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.180
It's really you.

458
00:32:58.180 --> 00:32:59.800
We all thought that you...

459
00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.210
Did Dark Shadow Man do anything to you?

460
00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:03.950
I'm fine. I'm fine.

461
00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:09.530
They really didn't do anything to you, did they?

462
00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:11.020
No.

463
00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:14.070
That time, when Dark Shadow Man

464
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:17.960
threw me down the mountain, I thought I would surely die.

465
00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:21.740
Who would have thought there will be a tree on the side of the cliff that hindered my fall.

466
00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:23.560
I didn't directly fall to the ground below.

467
00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.390
Luckily, I was able to survive.

468
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.320
Wen Xuan, as long as you're alright then that's good.

469
00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.840
When Granddaddy sees you, he will surely be very happy.

470
00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:33.830
Where is he?

471
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:36.050
He is inside sleeping.

472
00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:37.650
That's right.  Let's go. Go. Go.

473
00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:39.830
- Let's go.
- Okay.

474
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:42.350
Misters, there is clearly an inn in our village.

475
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:45.020
- Why must you live in my house?
- Stop your nonsense.

476
00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.290
Here. Take it. Cook us some dishes.

477
00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:50.200
Just stay in this house no matter how long you like.

478
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:52.250
Hurry and please come in. Hurry and please come in.

479
00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:01.620
How should I make my move?

480
00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:06.930
If you just go there recklessly now, you will surely scare her.

481
00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:09.110
It will instead create a negative impact.

482
00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:12.050
How about for your first step, write some love letters?

483
00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:15.900
When the time is right, you then go see her.

484
00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:20.300
Good idea. You probably wooed women before, right?

485
00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:24.470
What I mean is I am a boor.

486
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:25.990
I only recognize a few words.

487
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:28.750
Why don't you write a love letter for me?

488
00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:31.530
Let's make an agreement. If I am successful with this, I'll give you the child.

489
00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:33.530
What?!

490
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:35.520
I'll let you give the child's name.

491
00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.060
Just help me until the end.

492
00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:38.970
A bunch of nonsense.

493
00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:41.910
Let's go. Let's get in.

494
00:34:43.450 --> 00:34:46.780
I won't bother your writing then.

495
00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:50.940
I'm guessing that you are going to the Casual Guests' Inn, right?

496
00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:52.900
I'm just going to look around.

497
00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:54.970
Write it well. Help me write a good one.

498
00:34:54.970 --> 00:34:56.910
Please. Please.

499
00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:08.990
Granddaddy! Granddaddy! Granddaddy!

500
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:10.560
Come take a look! Look at who is back!

501
00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.690
Come. Come. Come.

502
00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:13.320
Don't do that anymore.

503
00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:16.000
- Granddaddy!
- Wen Xuan?

504
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.630
- My grandson.
- Granddaddy.

505
00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:22.750
Granddaddy. Granddaddy.

506
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:27.700
I thought I would not see you again.

507
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:31.060
- My good grandson.
- Granddaddy.

508
00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:34.350
- My good grandson.
- Granddaddy.

509
00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:44.300
Granddaddy, now that Wen Xuan was able to survive such a disaster, he surely will be blessed further.

510
00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:47.420
Wen Xuan, you don't know how worried Granddaddy was about you these past few days.

511
00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:49.310
He was so worried that he didn't even eat.

512
00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:50.790
Granddaddy, you must be hungry now.

513
00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:52.850
I'll go cook you some dishes.

514
00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:53.970
I'll go with you.

515
00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:55.810
Hey! Hey! I'm going, too.

516
00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:58.450
You all go. I'll accompany Granddaddy for a chat then.

517
00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:05.980
It's time to eat!

518
00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:08.070
Zi Su,

519
00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:10.030
- these hashbrowns of yours are thicker than my fingers.
- Hurry and taste this.

520
00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:12.650
How can one eat this?

521
00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:16.940
It's your choice if you want to eat it or not. These are palace-style hashbrowns

522
00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:18.290
Don't worry.

523
00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:20.250
Other than that dish, all the others were cooked by me.

524
00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:22.240
You can be at ease in eating them.

525
00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:27.900
Come. I'm giving each of you a toast.

526
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:29.940
- Come.
- Please. Come.

527
00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:37.850
But going back to it, we really have to thank Wen Xuan this time.

528
00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:43.150
If not because of him, we wouldn't be able to keep the Golden Magic Star in our hands safe, either.

529
00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:46.470
Aren't we all friends?

530
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:51.460
Moreover, risking danger just for my friend has always been my principle.

531
00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:58.250
Too bad. The Crimson Red Magic Star was still taken by Dark Shadow Man.

532
00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:05.630
This Dark Shadow Man better pray that I don't catch him.

533
00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:13.260
What do you guys plan to do next?

534
00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:20.290
What we plan to do next is find Dark Shadow Man and get the Crimson Red Magic Star that's in his hands.

535
00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:23.750
You guys keep talking about this Magic Star.

536
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:26.040
What really is this Magic Star?

537
00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.380
Can you take it out for me to see?

538
00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:29.990
Of course. I'll go get it for you.

539
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:31.730
Wait.

540
00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:36.590
Wen Xuan, don't be mischievous.

541
00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:40.390
What point is there for you to look at such a valuable object?

542
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:43.620
No, Granddaddy. I just want to look at it.

543
00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:45.860
I don't have any other purpose.

544
00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:55.820
Put down that thing that you're holding!

545
00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:08.000
Granddaddy, I just came to look if they kept the item well.

546
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.780
Hey! Give that back to me!

547
00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:11.520
What are you doing?!

548
00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:14.180
Granddaddy, it's not like what you are thinking.

549
00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:21.730
Wen Xuan, give the Magic Star back to me.

550
00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:23.780
You actually aren't my grandson, Wen Xuan.

551
00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:26.640
You don't have any demonic exterminator aura in your body at all.

552
00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.050
Who really are you?!

553
00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:30.350
Wen Xuan, what are you doing?

554
00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:33.230
Old man,

555
00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:35.650
you still discovered me.

556
00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:42.360
Wen Xuan's skin was so narrow and small.

557
00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.920
This way, it's more comfortable.

558
00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.810
Hurry! Hurry and chase after him! Get your weapons!

559
00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:09.620
Hand over the Magic Star!

560
00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:05.330
A Ji Ya! Hurry!

561
00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:34.520
Bai Ze!

562
00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:53.320
Give me back my grandson!

563
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:58.420
Let go of Granddaddy!

564
00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:00.850
Don't mind me! Get your item back!

565
00:42:00.850 --> 00:42:02.720
Old man! There's no need for you to speak right now!

566
00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:04.620
You bastard! If you have guts, face us!

567
00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:06.230
- Let go of Granddaddy!
- Let Granddaddy go!

568
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:08.650
<i>Let him go? Of course, I can.</i>

569
00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:11.200
Throw all your weapons away!

570
00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:12.880
Put them down!

571
00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:17.090
Put them down.

572
00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:29.050
Hurry and let Granddaddy go!

573
00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:30.740
Turn around! Move back!

574
00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:31.880
Don't be too much!

575
00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:33.420
Can't you understand my words?!

576
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:35.140
We've already dropped our weapons! Let go of Granddaddy!

577
00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:37.230
Children! Don't mind me!

578
00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:39.210
Raise your weapons!

579
00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:41.070
Old man that wouldn't die! It's not time for you to talk right now!

580
00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:42.460
Granddaddy!

581
00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:44.020
- Shut up!
- Wen Xuan!

582
00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:46.480
Granddaddy is coming to be with you!

583
00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:48.980
No! Granddaddy!

584
00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:49.990
Granddaddy!

585
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:52.120
Old thing...

586
00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:54.350
Granddaddy! Granddaddy!

587
00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:56.410
Granddaddy!

588
00:42:56.410 --> 00:43:00.030
Granddaddy! Granddaddy!

589
00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:03.480
- Granddaddy!
- Granddaddy!

590
00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:05.430
Granddaddy...

591
