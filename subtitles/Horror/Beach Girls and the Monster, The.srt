3
00:00:47,954 --> 00:00:49,723
Park Hae Joo...

4
00:00:50,123 --> 00:00:52,392
transferred from Seyeon Girls High School...

5
00:00:52,392 --> 00:00:55,162
in Hyehwa-dong in Seoul.

6
00:00:56,063 --> 00:00:59,199
Her father is a professor...

7
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:03,670
at Seoul University. He is a great man.

8
00:01:04,304 --> 00:01:06,473
- Seoul University? - Really?

9
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,741
Quiet.

10
00:01:08,141 --> 00:01:10,711
Moreover, Hae Joo...

11
00:01:10,744 --> 00:01:12,779
has been top of her class...

12
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:15,215
the entire time at Seyeon.

13
00:01:15,282 --> 00:01:17,150
- Top of her class. - Wow.

14
00:01:17,484 --> 00:01:20,320
As the top student at her last school...

15
00:01:21,555 --> 00:01:22,823
Well...

16
00:01:22,923 --> 00:01:26,493
Compared to you stupid pigs whose grades stink,

17
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,463
she will be the model student.

18
00:01:29,463 --> 00:01:31,732
We have high hopes for her.

19
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,902
Okay, Hae Joo.

20
00:01:36,303 --> 00:01:37,370
Say something.

21
00:01:45,712 --> 00:01:48,515
Don't mind those punks.

22
00:01:48,515 --> 00:01:50,450
Speak comfortably.

23
00:01:52,352 --> 00:01:53,420
Sir.

24
00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:56,323
I feel bad introducing myself...

25
00:01:56,823 --> 00:02:00,393
while my friends are being punished.

26
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,863
I'd like you to let them sit back down.

27
00:02:05,265 --> 00:02:07,701
Wow. She's got guts.

28
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:10,003
- Wow. - Seriously.

29
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,671
Oh my gosh.

30
00:02:15,175 --> 00:02:17,244
Hae Joo,

31
00:02:17,611 --> 00:02:20,881
not only are you smart, you have a heart of gold.

32
00:02:22,783 --> 00:02:25,952
You guys lucked out because of Hae Joo.

33
00:02:27,154 --> 00:02:28,255
Get down.

34
00:02:38,131 --> 00:02:40,700
Jung Hee. You punk. What are you doing?

35
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,469
Hey, Jung Hee.

36
00:02:42,602 --> 00:02:43,770
Come down.

37
00:02:46,072 --> 00:02:47,140
Come down.

38
00:02:53,513 --> 00:02:54,681
Thank you.

39
00:02:58,351 --> 00:02:59,519
Hello.

40
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,621
I'm Park Hae Joo.

41
00:03:03,023 --> 00:03:04,524
I'm not a genius,

42
00:03:04,891 --> 00:03:06,660
or a model student.

43
00:03:07,561 --> 00:03:10,430
I'm an average student who likes...

44
00:03:10,463 --> 00:03:13,433
Sanulrim, Hae Eun Hee, and the Beatles.

45
00:03:14,234 --> 00:03:15,402
Also,

46
00:03:15,969 --> 00:03:17,671
one day,

47
00:03:18,271 --> 00:03:20,640
I want to experience passionate love.

48
00:03:22,075 --> 00:03:25,245
I am a hot-blooded woman.

49
00:03:28,315 --> 00:03:29,649
Yes.

50
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:37,591
- It's nice to meet you. - Welcome.

51
00:03:48,635 --> 00:03:50,403
(Episode 2)

52
00:03:53,073 --> 00:03:55,141
Did you see Hae Joo's skin?

53
00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:56,710
Is it because she's from Seoul?

54
00:03:56,943 --> 00:03:59,913
She has incredibly nice skin.

55
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,781
She's pretty too.

56
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:04,251
She kind of looks like Jang Mee Hee.

57
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:07,554
No way. She looks like Im Ye Jin.

58
00:04:07,554 --> 00:04:10,991
Whatever. Im Ye Jin would cry out in anger.

59
00:04:11,124 --> 00:04:12,559
Im Ye Jin? Whatever.

60
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,495
She looks like Bae Yun Jung.

61
00:04:16,162 --> 00:04:17,931
- The comedian? - Yes.

62
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:20,734
- No way. - That's not true.

63
00:04:20,734 --> 00:04:22,869
- Not Bae Yun Jung. - No way.

64
00:04:22,869 --> 00:04:24,871
What? She has eyes like this...

65
00:04:24,871 --> 00:04:26,973
- just like Bae Yun Jung. - No way.

66
00:04:29,843 --> 00:04:33,313
Hi. You're the girl from yesterday,

67
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,081
right?

68
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:37,984
What?

69
00:04:42,422 --> 00:04:43,590
Do you know her?

70
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,392
How's your knee?

71
00:04:45,692 --> 00:04:47,060
It didn't get infected?

72
00:04:48,461 --> 00:04:49,462
No.

73
00:04:50,163 --> 00:04:53,333
I'm glad. My dad and I were worried.

74
00:04:55,201 --> 00:04:56,369
Jung Hee?

75
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,505
Hi, Jung Hee.

76
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:00,874
Let's be friends.

77
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,981
Hey. Jung Hee.

78
00:05:09,783 --> 00:05:12,452
That's right. We have history class.

79
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,722
I didn't do my homework.

80
00:05:16,923 --> 00:05:18,224
That's right.

81
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,369
What?

82
00:05:29,803 --> 00:05:31,671
We didn't even go in.

83
00:05:31,671 --> 00:05:33,540
You're being so mean.

84
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,841
What?

85
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,411
What are they doing?

86
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:39,879
We didn't do anything.

87
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,682
Jung Hee, isn't that your brother?

88
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:46,353
- Dong Moon is here too. - Fish Head is here too.

89
00:05:46,853 --> 00:05:48,054
What are they doing?

90
00:05:48,455 --> 00:05:50,590
Hey! Here she comes!

91
00:05:50,991 --> 00:05:52,292
- Yes. - She's coming!

92
00:05:52,292 --> 00:05:53,593
She's here.

93
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,332
Are they all here to see Hae Joo?

94
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,001
They are.

95
00:06:01,001 --> 00:06:03,470
I guess word got out that a pretty girl...

96
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:06,139
transferred here from Seoul.

97
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,142
What pretty girl?

98
00:06:10,744 --> 00:06:11,811
Let's go.

99
00:06:14,414 --> 00:06:16,783
Hi, Jung Hee. You just finished?

100
00:06:16,983 --> 00:06:19,319
Aren't you going down there?

101
00:06:19,652 --> 00:06:22,322
Not me. I'm here...

102
00:06:23,723 --> 00:06:24,991
to see you.

103
00:06:26,593 --> 00:06:28,094
Don't.

104
00:06:28,695 --> 00:06:30,930
Jung Hee. We'll go first.

105
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,533
Wait for me! Eun Ja!

106
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:38,271
What? Do you need to talk to me?

107
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,975
Well...

108
00:06:43,343 --> 00:06:45,812
- The thing is... - If not, I'm leaving.

109
00:06:49,349 --> 00:06:50,450
Jung Hee.

110
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,852
Aren't you hungry? Want to get pastries?

111
00:06:53,153 --> 00:06:54,621
I got my allowance.

112
00:06:54,654 --> 00:06:56,423
I don't like pastries.

113
00:06:56,423 --> 00:06:59,592
Then do you want tempura? Spicy rice cakes?

114
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,462
Eat by yourself.

115
00:07:02,462 --> 00:07:03,830
I'm busy, so bye.

116
00:07:06,332 --> 00:07:07,400
Jung Hee.

117
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:11,671
Why is she always so busy?

118
00:07:31,391 --> 00:07:33,860
Excuse me. Didn't we meet...

119
00:07:33,993 --> 00:07:35,962
yesterday at the intersection?

120
00:07:36,262 --> 00:07:37,330
The pharmacy.

121
00:07:38,731 --> 00:07:41,434
Yes. Hello.

122
00:07:41,601 --> 00:07:42,602
Hello.

123
00:07:44,304 --> 00:07:45,472
A junior?

124
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,575
- Yes. - Then I'm older.

125
00:07:48,741 --> 00:07:51,111
I'm Son Jin, a senior at Gyeryoon.

126
00:07:51,111 --> 00:07:53,413
May I speak casually to you?

127
00:08:08,495 --> 00:08:10,163
Anyway, the thing is...

128
00:08:14,534 --> 00:08:16,803
If you have any questions...

129
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,472
or need help with anything, call me.

130
00:08:21,841 --> 00:08:22,842
But...

131
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,353
Okay. Goodbye.

132
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:36,422
See you.

133
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,193
Hey. Jung Hee.

134
00:08:40,193 --> 00:08:42,162
Is it true? The cosmos flower is in your class?

135
00:08:42,162 --> 00:08:43,363
Cosmos?

136
00:08:43,363 --> 00:08:47,200
You know, the new girl that moved recently.

137
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,469
Cosmos? What garbage.

138
00:08:49,469 --> 00:08:50,470
I was worried...

139
00:08:50,603 --> 00:08:54,040
because I thought Cosmos was older than me.

140
00:08:54,841 --> 00:08:56,609
How lucky. Bring her home.

141
00:08:56,609 --> 00:08:57,744
What? Why?

142
00:08:57,744 --> 00:08:58,745
What do you mean?

143
00:08:59,212 --> 00:09:01,981
Your big brother wants to get close to her.

144
00:09:01,981 --> 00:09:05,852
Hey, Bong Soo. I saw you camped outside my school.

145
00:09:05,852 --> 00:09:06,853
Get it together...

146
00:09:06,853 --> 00:09:08,922
before I tell Father.

147
00:09:12,492 --> 00:09:13,860
Tell me what?

148
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,628
Hello, Father.

149
00:09:17,063 --> 00:09:18,731
Tell me. What?

150
00:09:19,132 --> 00:09:20,600
It's nothing.

151
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,101
- It's nothing? - No.

152
00:09:22,402 --> 00:09:23,403
Okay.

153
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:27,340
Why are you always bugging your brother?

154
00:09:27,473 --> 00:09:29,742
You wench.

155
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:33,213
You couldn't be born a boy like Bong Soo.

156
00:09:33,913 --> 00:09:34,914
Go inside.

157
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:37,951
Have a nice day!

158
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:38,952
Sure.

159
00:09:39,752 --> 00:09:40,820
Jung Hee.

160
00:09:42,222 --> 00:09:44,190
- Jung Hee. - Jung Hee!

161
00:09:44,524 --> 00:09:45,892
Yes?

162
00:09:45,892 --> 00:09:47,093
Show him respect.

163
00:09:47,961 --> 00:09:49,862
Get home safely, Father.

164
00:09:51,731 --> 00:09:52,732
Jung Hee.

165
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,801
Jung Hee.

166
00:09:55,034 --> 00:09:56,202
Hi, number three.

167
00:09:56,302 --> 00:09:58,071
Jung Hee. Hey!

168
00:09:58,504 --> 00:09:59,973
Cosmos?

169
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,479
Jung Hee. Cosmos.

170
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:08,481
- She's in your class. - Get out of here!

171
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:10,850
Mom! Jung Hee is hitting me!

172
00:10:11,484 --> 00:10:13,152
What Cosmos?

173
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:24,564
Hae Joo, that Seoul chick,

174
00:10:26,132 --> 00:10:27,800
is getting on my nerves.

175
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,613
What's so pretty about the Seoul chick?

176
00:10:42,782 --> 00:10:44,584
I'm much prettier.

177
00:10:48,821 --> 00:10:50,490
(September 10, 1979)

178
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,794
When will Sunday come?

179
00:10:55,161 --> 00:10:56,829
I miss Jin.

180
00:10:58,831 --> 00:11:01,601
- All right. - What did you bring?

181
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,172
Jin.

182
00:11:06,172 --> 00:11:08,875
Jung Hee, let's eat our yummy food.

183
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,510
I'm not hungry.

184
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,512
Don't you have a broadcast today?

185
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,083
We're taking turns starting this week.

186
00:11:19,652 --> 00:11:22,155
Where did the Seoul chick go?

187
00:11:22,155 --> 00:11:24,324
This is JHBS,

188
00:11:24,324 --> 00:11:26,693
Jeonghyeon's broadcasting club.

189
00:11:27,093 --> 00:11:29,228
We will now begin the afternoon broadcast.

190
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:31,331
Hello,

191
00:11:32,031 --> 00:11:33,299
my fellow students.

192
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,669
The canna flowers that graced the streets...

193
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:38,705
have shed their petals...

194
00:11:38,705 --> 00:11:43,042
Isn't that the Seoul chick?

195
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:44,744
But the club president was supposed to do it.

196
00:11:44,744 --> 00:11:46,079
Were you surprised by the unfamiliar voice?

197
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:50,683
I'm one of your afternoon broadcasters.

198
00:11:50,683 --> 00:11:53,553
My name is Park Hae Joo.

199
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,923
I'm nervous because it's my first broadcast.

200
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,692
It would be very encouraging...

201
00:11:59,692 --> 00:12:01,861
if you'd cheer me on.

202
00:12:02,462 --> 00:12:03,629
Jung Hee.

203
00:12:04,864 --> 00:12:08,134
Didn't you say you'd do the broadcast?

204
00:12:08,134 --> 00:12:11,604
Carpenters' "Top of the World".

205
00:12:13,473 --> 00:12:15,742
"Top of the World". Awesome!

206
00:12:16,909 --> 00:12:18,978
I was going to,

207
00:12:18,978 --> 00:12:21,814
but I'm a senior now, so it's sort of a burden.

208
00:12:22,181 --> 00:12:24,283
- Was I okay? - How is Hae Joo...

209
00:12:25,084 --> 00:12:26,619
in our broadcasting club?

210
00:12:26,619 --> 00:12:29,222
She was the DJ at her old school.

211
00:12:29,222 --> 00:12:32,492
The club president there is my junior high friend.

212
00:12:32,492 --> 00:12:34,160
She recommended her.

213
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:43,669
Why was our schedule changed again?

214
00:12:43,669 --> 00:12:46,773
The instructor is going somewhere for training.

215
00:12:47,073 --> 00:12:49,208
Change quickly!

216
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:52,979
If you're late, you have to take 10 laps.

217
00:12:53,212 --> 00:12:54,881
- You know that, right? - What's this?

218
00:12:54,881 --> 00:12:56,182
Where's my gym uniform?

219
00:12:56,182 --> 00:12:58,184
Look carefully.

220
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:01,454
Hurry it up!

221
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,563
Hey. Look at the Seoul chick.

222
00:13:13,132 --> 00:13:14,734
A strappy undershirt?

223
00:13:15,501 --> 00:13:18,171
Wow. Ae Sook's strappy undershirt...

224
00:13:18,171 --> 00:13:20,239
doesn't even compare.

225
00:13:22,942 --> 00:13:26,312
You said only delinquents wear strappy ones, right?

226
00:13:26,312 --> 00:13:27,980
Is she a one too?

227
00:13:29,182 --> 00:13:32,251
Who knows? Maybe she is a total delinquent.

228
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:35,354
Where is my gym uniform?

229
00:13:37,123 --> 00:13:38,825
Attention!

230
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:47,733
At... Ease!

231
00:13:49,469 --> 00:13:50,503
You two.

232
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,271
Get up here.

233
00:13:52,738 --> 00:13:53,973
Get up here!

234
00:14:02,281 --> 00:14:03,583
Jung Hee.

235
00:14:04,784 --> 00:14:07,220
Why are you dressed like that?

236
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,690
I lost my gym uniform top.

237
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,993
- And you? - I just transferred,

238
00:14:13,993 --> 00:14:15,862
so I do not have it yet.

239
00:14:16,762 --> 00:14:18,564
Being a transfer student...

240
00:14:18,731 --> 00:14:20,199
is an excuse!

241
00:14:21,133 --> 00:14:24,070
How could a soldier enter a war...

242
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,272
without her uniform?

243
00:14:26,272 --> 00:14:29,208
I tried to borrow one from another class,

244
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:32,311
but our class schedule was suddenly changed,

245
00:14:32,478 --> 00:14:34,680
so I did not have time to borrow one.

246
00:14:34,881 --> 00:14:37,283
- That is unacceptable. - She is pretty.

247
00:14:38,384 --> 00:14:40,853
Make the impossible possible.

248
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,523
Don't you know that is the attitude...

249
00:14:43,523 --> 00:14:47,760
the youth must live by in this new era?

250
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,928
We do know!

251
00:14:49,862 --> 00:14:51,531
Why aren't you answering?

252
00:14:51,764 --> 00:14:53,499
I think...

253
00:14:54,033 --> 00:14:56,702
trying to force something that is impossible...

254
00:14:56,903 --> 00:14:59,171
to make it happen is reckless.

255
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,610
- What? - Rather,

256
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:08,781
I think trying my best in something I can do...

257
00:15:08,781 --> 00:15:11,050
is much more productive.

258
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,528
Two of you.

259
00:15:23,563 --> 00:15:26,032
Take 10 laps around the field.

260
00:15:26,032 --> 00:15:28,000
That's not fair.

261
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,769
Shall I make it 100?

262
00:15:32,772 --> 00:15:33,973
I'll run.

263
00:15:37,143 --> 00:15:38,210
What are you doing?

264
00:15:46,619 --> 00:15:47,920
Stay in line!

265
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,089
If either of you stops,

266
00:15:50,523 --> 00:15:53,859
you'll have to run 200 laps!

267
00:15:55,061 --> 00:15:56,062
Attention!

268
00:15:57,163 --> 00:15:58,731
At ease!

269
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:11,243
Poor Jung Hee.

270
00:16:11,243 --> 00:16:13,613
What if she faints?

271
00:16:14,213 --> 00:16:15,314
Gosh.

272
00:16:16,482 --> 00:16:17,583
What?

273
00:16:23,956 --> 00:16:25,324
Hey. Ae Sook.

274
00:16:26,525 --> 00:16:29,295
Oh Man Sang wants you in the teacher's office.

275
00:16:36,702 --> 00:16:37,703
Ae Sook.

276
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,873
You smoked in the bathroom at Ahram Church, right?

277
00:16:41,507 --> 00:16:42,541
I did not.

278
00:16:43,275 --> 00:16:46,178
Yes, you did. There was a witness.

279
00:16:46,612 --> 00:16:47,947
Darn it.

280
00:16:48,114 --> 00:16:49,482
Did Jung Hee tattle on me?

281
00:16:49,482 --> 00:16:51,617
"Did Jung Hee tattle on me?"

282
00:16:51,651 --> 00:16:54,787
I guess that means you did smoke.

283
00:16:58,758 --> 00:17:01,527
Look at these fingers.

284
00:17:07,066 --> 00:17:08,267
Do you smoke Guhbooksun?

285
00:17:08,267 --> 00:17:10,403
No. I smoke Chungja.

286
00:17:14,173 --> 00:17:15,641
How fancy.

287
00:17:17,443 --> 00:17:20,446
Chungja?

288
00:17:20,446 --> 00:17:23,816
Chungja? You punk. You smoke Chungja?

289
00:17:23,816 --> 00:17:27,386
You smoked Chungja? Then get smacked!

290
00:17:27,386 --> 00:17:30,956
You need to get smacked for smoking.

291
00:17:58,651 --> 00:17:59,685
Jung Hee.

292
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,387
Sorry.

293
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:04,223
I shouldn't have talked back.

294
00:18:04,423 --> 00:18:05,691
Run properly.

295
00:18:06,092 --> 00:18:07,293
She's watching.

296
00:18:07,893 --> 00:18:09,328
Run straight.

297
00:18:14,033 --> 00:18:15,735
Hang onto me.

298
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:32,551
1, 2.

299
00:18:33,753 --> 00:18:34,720
What are you doing?

300
00:18:35,154 --> 00:18:36,255
1, 2.

301
00:18:37,223 --> 00:18:38,357
3, 4.

302
00:18:38,491 --> 00:18:39,725
1, 2.

303
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:41,427
3, 4.

304
00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:43,429
1, 2.

305
00:18:44,163 --> 00:18:45,431
3, 4.

306
00:18:46,165 --> 00:18:47,399
1, 2.

307
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:48,934
3, 4.

308
00:19:00,112 --> 00:19:01,180
Jung Hee.

309
00:19:01,814 --> 00:19:03,916
Are you free today after school?

310
00:19:04,917 --> 00:19:07,653
There's a lot I don't know about the broadcast club.

311
00:19:09,755 --> 00:19:12,158
I have to rush home.

312
00:19:14,193 --> 00:19:15,194
You do?

313
00:19:15,194 --> 00:19:17,196
You know Soo Nim from the club?

314
00:19:17,363 --> 00:19:18,697
The producer.

315
00:19:18,898 --> 00:19:21,700
She'll tell you anything you ask.

316
00:19:23,068 --> 00:19:24,136
Okay.

317
00:19:44,223 --> 00:19:45,257
Hey.

318
00:19:46,492 --> 00:19:47,626
It was you, right?

319
00:19:49,695 --> 00:19:51,664
What?

320
00:19:52,932 --> 00:19:54,466
You tattled on me...

321
00:19:54,466 --> 00:19:56,435
about seeing me smoke, didn't you?

322
00:19:56,435 --> 00:19:57,870
To get back at me.

323
00:19:58,671 --> 00:20:01,907
Shoot. I got probation again because of you.

324
00:20:02,608 --> 00:20:04,610
I wouldn't get back at you.

325
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,911
I'm not you.

326
00:20:06,312 --> 00:20:07,680
I didn't tell.

327
00:20:10,182 --> 00:20:12,418
Jung Hee. Just wait.

328
00:20:12,585 --> 00:20:14,620
Once my probation is over,

329
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,422
I'll get you back.

330
00:20:16,522 --> 00:20:19,124
I told you, it really wasn't me.

331
00:20:19,992 --> 00:20:22,094
Are you girls fighting again?

332
00:20:22,261 --> 00:20:24,663
Young Choon. Where are you going?

333
00:20:26,432 --> 00:20:28,667
Ae Sook, let go. It's hot.

334
00:20:28,834 --> 00:20:31,670
Are you free tonight? Want to go clubbing?

335
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,505
No. I have to work.

336
00:20:34,006 --> 00:20:36,475
That's right. Dang Pyo was released.

337
00:20:36,475 --> 00:20:37,910
He wants to see you.

338
00:20:39,011 --> 00:20:40,512
"Released"?

339
00:20:40,613 --> 00:20:42,815
- Let's go. - Let go of me.

340
00:20:43,082 --> 00:20:44,617
Keep fighting. She's running away.

341
00:20:44,617 --> 00:20:46,886
- Go catch her. - No, it's okay.

342
00:20:46,886 --> 00:20:47,953
Let's go.

343
00:20:50,422 --> 00:20:51,690
Are you just getting home?

344
00:20:52,324 --> 00:20:53,592
Do you feel sick?

345
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:55,427
No, I'm just tired.

346
00:20:55,427 --> 00:20:57,563
Was Young Choon at the pharmacy?

347
00:20:57,563 --> 00:21:00,599
Sewing machine number two broke this time.

348
00:21:02,368 --> 00:21:03,435
That's right.

349
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,172
Auntie. Young Choon...

350
00:21:07,172 --> 00:21:08,941
must really be a gangster.

351
00:21:09,675 --> 00:21:13,012
He must be friends with someone in jail.

352
00:21:13,245 --> 00:21:14,613
- Is that right? - Yes.

353
00:21:14,613 --> 00:21:18,017
I told you to be careful, and that he's a gangster.

354
00:21:18,617 --> 00:21:21,153
We have no idea where Young Choon...

355
00:21:21,153 --> 00:21:23,756
came from or what he did before.

356
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,825
I'll take that, ma'am.

357
00:21:28,227 --> 00:21:31,697
Auntie. Don't be good to that gangster.

358
00:21:32,765 --> 00:21:35,100
You watch yourself too.

359
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,236
- What did I do? - Still,

360
00:21:37,369 --> 00:21:40,272
Young Choon is good to his little sister.

361
00:21:40,272 --> 00:21:42,074
Sister? Whatever.

362
00:21:42,741 --> 00:21:45,711
People say Eng Cho is not his little sister,

363
00:21:46,078 --> 00:21:48,681
but actually his daughter.

364
00:21:48,914 --> 00:21:50,082
Really?

365
00:21:50,282 --> 00:21:52,985
Then how old was he when he had her?

366
00:21:53,752 --> 00:21:56,422
Study if you have time to calculate that.

367
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:01,193
Auntie, why do you always wipe that chamber pot?

368
00:22:01,293 --> 00:22:03,629
- It's dirty. - It gets tarnished.

369
00:22:03,963 --> 00:22:06,532
You have to wipe it every day like this.

370
00:22:08,167 --> 00:22:10,869
You can go on a chamber pot wiping contest.

371
00:22:12,905 --> 00:22:14,473
Number three.

372
00:22:14,873 --> 00:22:17,943
There's no contest for wiping chamber pots.

373
00:22:45,437 --> 00:22:46,772
Hello.

374
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,883
It looks like the one next to it may fall too.

375
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,454
I know.

376
00:23:09,762 --> 00:23:12,331
Didn't you help us with our move?

377
00:23:12,464 --> 00:23:13,732
Thank you.

378
00:23:16,635 --> 00:23:18,971
Do you work at the pharmacy?

379
00:23:25,144 --> 00:23:26,178
Okay then.

380
00:23:53,105 --> 00:23:54,406
Young Choon!

381
00:23:55,941 --> 00:23:57,976
- Eng Cho. - Are you okay?

382
00:24:00,012 --> 00:24:01,413
You got hit hard.

383
00:24:01,647 --> 00:24:03,082
I didn't. I'm fine.

384
00:24:03,215 --> 00:24:04,616
What are you doing?

385
00:24:05,651 --> 00:24:07,319
What else? I'm working.

386
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:09,955
Go to the pharmacy. Don't walk around alone.

387
00:24:11,056 --> 00:24:12,724
It's boring there.

388
00:24:13,392 --> 00:24:15,694
Can't I stay here too?

389
00:24:19,231 --> 00:24:21,433
Eng Cho? What a pretty name.

390
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:24,169
Do you want to play with me while he works?

391
00:24:24,369 --> 00:24:26,305
- Yes. - No, it's okay.

392
00:24:26,772 --> 00:24:28,340
I'll stay with her.

393
00:24:29,608 --> 00:24:30,943
Let's go, Eng Cho.

394
00:24:38,484 --> 00:24:39,551
Miss.

395
00:24:40,385 --> 00:24:41,687
What is that you're carrying?

396
00:24:41,687 --> 00:24:42,955
Egg pastries.

397
00:24:43,055 --> 00:24:46,191
Hae Joo made it. It's super tasty.

398
00:24:46,992 --> 00:24:48,627
Why did you take that?

399
00:24:48,961 --> 00:24:51,830
She said to give it to you.

400
00:24:57,069 --> 00:24:58,103
Let's go.

401
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:01,406
"The night sky is a deep red,"

402
00:25:01,907 --> 00:25:06,145
"and your lips are also dyed red."

403
00:25:06,311 --> 00:25:10,215
"They look like they turned red..."

404
00:25:10,315 --> 00:25:11,884
"from longing."

405
00:25:14,553 --> 00:25:17,156
Hello, my fellow students.

406
00:25:17,556 --> 00:25:19,925
The first song today will be...

407
00:25:20,192 --> 00:25:23,195
the Carpenters... The Carpenters'...

408
00:25:23,462 --> 00:25:25,664
"Top of the World".

409
00:25:27,366 --> 00:25:28,767
World.

410
00:25:30,602 --> 00:25:31,870
World.

411
00:25:32,371 --> 00:25:33,772
You scared me!

412
00:25:34,072 --> 00:25:35,174
What is it?

413
00:25:35,941 --> 00:25:37,042
You brat.

414
00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:40,112
Are you impersonating Olivia?

415
00:25:40,345 --> 00:25:41,513
Because you're jealous.

416
00:25:41,513 --> 00:25:43,782
- Olivia? - Come to think of it,

417
00:25:43,782 --> 00:25:47,119
Olivia Hussey is more her than a cosmos flower,

418
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:49,221
so that's what I'm calling her.

419
00:25:49,221 --> 00:25:51,757
Goodness. You and your gibberish.

420
00:25:51,757 --> 00:25:53,292
I said to stay out!

421
00:25:53,292 --> 00:25:55,093
- What? - Get out!

422
00:25:55,093 --> 00:25:56,762
Stop hitting me!

423
00:25:57,763 --> 00:25:59,331
Olivia Hussey?

424
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,236
(September 11, 1979)

425
00:26:04,636 --> 00:26:06,471
Is it still only Tuesday?

426
00:26:34,733 --> 00:26:36,735
Auntie. What are you doing there?

427
00:26:36,935 --> 00:26:38,003
Hi.

428
00:26:38,337 --> 00:26:41,173
I need to put this in the master bedroom,

429
00:26:41,506 --> 00:26:43,742
but your mom is at the factory.

430
00:26:44,243 --> 00:26:46,144
Can you put it here?

431
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:48,380
No. You do it.

432
00:26:48,647 --> 00:26:50,649
Why would I go into the master bedroom?

433
00:26:50,782 --> 00:26:52,951
- I don't want to either. - Gosh.

434
00:26:54,386 --> 00:26:55,420
Give it to me.

435
00:26:56,321 --> 00:26:57,422
Give it.

436
00:26:59,091 --> 00:27:00,192
Happy?

437
00:27:01,727 --> 00:27:02,861
Get back to work.

438
00:27:03,262 --> 00:27:04,496
That's right.

439
00:27:14,172 --> 00:27:15,574
Are you studying hard?

440
00:27:15,807 --> 00:27:17,609
Yes.

441
00:27:17,876 --> 00:27:18,910
You are?

442
00:27:19,511 --> 00:27:20,679
Do it right.

443
00:27:21,013 --> 00:27:23,181
Don't waste time doing other things.

444
00:27:23,682 --> 00:27:25,017
- Okay. - Good.

445
00:27:25,417 --> 00:27:29,354
Gosh. Why did your mom send a girl to school?

446
00:27:29,521 --> 00:27:31,423
Gosh. Sleep.

447
00:27:33,692 --> 00:27:36,762
A girl this, a girl that...

448
00:27:38,563 --> 00:27:41,667
Number three! Check for defects!

449
00:27:41,867 --> 00:27:43,635
Yes, I'm doing that now.

450
00:27:45,804 --> 00:27:49,107
Auntie! Where did you go? You said you'd be quick.

451
00:27:49,107 --> 00:27:50,876
I'm sorry. I had to go to the washroom.

452
00:27:51,076 --> 00:27:53,011
Did you poop?

453
00:28:04,956 --> 00:28:06,425
I'm so tired.

454
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:08,293
I'm so tired.

455
00:28:08,927 --> 00:28:10,262
Where's the chamber pot?

456
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,332
You've got to be kidding me.

457
00:28:13,565 --> 00:28:15,133
What are you eating so late at night?

458
00:28:15,167 --> 00:28:17,936
- What? - Where's the chamber pot?

459
00:28:18,904 --> 00:28:21,406
- Father took it in. - He did?

460
00:28:22,974 --> 00:28:24,142
What got into him?

461
00:28:24,943 --> 00:28:28,747
He pees and poops in it, but never touches it.

462
00:28:29,881 --> 00:28:31,650
That's strange.

463
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,922
He touched it fine.

464
00:29:20,966 --> 00:29:22,834
Hae Jung made it.

465
00:29:22,834 --> 00:29:24,102
It's super tasty.

466
00:29:24,102 --> 00:29:26,071
Why did you take that?

467
00:29:26,104 --> 00:29:28,840
She said to give it to you.

468
00:29:44,055 --> 00:29:45,991
(September 13, 1979)

469
00:29:45,991 --> 00:29:47,692
(September 14, 1979)

470
00:29:47,692 --> 00:29:48,660
(September 15, 1979)

471
00:29:53,432 --> 00:29:54,666
Hi, Hae Joo.

472
00:29:57,169 --> 00:29:59,371
What about this song?

473
00:29:59,371 --> 00:30:01,907
That sounds good.

474
00:30:01,907 --> 00:30:03,675
I like it.

475
00:30:03,675 --> 00:30:06,077
This one and that one.

476
00:30:06,077 --> 00:30:07,612
How's this?

477
00:30:08,413 --> 00:30:12,984
(September 16, 1979)

478
00:30:13,151 --> 00:30:17,656
(Kim's Pharmacy)

479
00:30:17,656 --> 00:30:19,391
Why are you always...

480
00:30:42,814 --> 00:30:44,182
Jin.

481
00:30:45,317 --> 00:30:46,751
Are you not coming today?

482
00:30:51,423 --> 00:30:54,359
Poor Jung Hee. She's waiting so long.

483
00:30:56,661 --> 00:30:58,129
That's so strange.

484
00:30:59,431 --> 00:31:00,966
He said he'd see me again.

485
00:31:10,475 --> 00:31:12,744
- I... - Hi, Jin.

486
00:31:22,621 --> 00:31:24,956
Hello, Jin.

487
00:31:25,156 --> 00:31:27,425
Hi. Are you here to study?

488
00:31:27,425 --> 00:31:28,493
Yes.

489
00:31:30,762 --> 00:31:34,099
I thought you weren't coming today.

490
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:36,301
I got here late, so I was studying...

491
00:31:36,301 --> 00:31:37,669
in the boys' room.

492
00:31:40,972 --> 00:31:42,574
Are you leaving?

493
00:31:43,475 --> 00:31:45,877
Yes, I have to go tutor.

494
00:31:47,012 --> 00:31:48,446
Don't follow me today.

495
00:31:48,446 --> 00:31:50,615
Study hard, okay?

496
00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:52,951
- Okay. - Good.

497
00:31:53,752 --> 00:31:54,753
See you again.

498
00:32:02,093 --> 00:32:03,828
The boys' room?

499
00:32:10,702 --> 00:32:11,870
No.

500
00:32:12,137 --> 00:32:13,405
I will follow him.

501
00:32:24,416 --> 00:32:26,451
Did Jin leave already?

502
00:32:30,221 --> 00:32:31,222
Jung Hee.

503
00:32:31,356 --> 00:32:33,058
Hi.

504
00:32:33,058 --> 00:32:34,359
Are you here to study?

505
00:32:34,826 --> 00:32:36,695
- Yes. - I heard they had...

506
00:32:36,695 --> 00:32:39,030
a nice music room, so I'm here to listen to music.

507
00:32:39,931 --> 00:32:41,132
I see.

508
00:32:41,466 --> 00:32:43,001
Are you going home?

509
00:32:43,602 --> 00:32:44,669
Let's go together.

510
00:32:53,411 --> 00:32:54,412
Jung Hee.

511
00:32:55,981 --> 00:32:57,315
Is something on your mind?

512
00:32:58,883 --> 00:32:59,951
No.

513
00:33:10,428 --> 00:33:12,631
What? Another English song?

514
00:33:14,866 --> 00:33:16,635
This is my favorite song.

515
00:33:16,635 --> 00:33:19,704
It always cheers me up when I'm down.

516
00:33:30,315 --> 00:33:34,452
We first met yesterday And fell in love

517
00:33:34,452 --> 00:33:39,190
And we made an oath

518
00:33:47,832 --> 00:33:52,003
When the night is over, I'll take the first train

519
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:57,575
And leave for the land of happiness

520
00:34:12,791 --> 00:34:15,994
The river flows

521
00:34:21,433 --> 00:34:24,903
The river flows

522
00:34:25,003 --> 00:34:28,373
Under the bridge

523
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:32,877
Carrying our dream

524
00:34:32,944 --> 00:34:36,181
Carrying our hearts

525
00:34:36,414 --> 00:34:40,418
We first met yesterday And fell in love

526
00:34:40,485 --> 00:34:44,589
And we made an oath

527
00:34:44,723 --> 00:34:46,925
When the night is over,

528
00:34:46,991 --> 00:34:48,960
I'll take the first train

529
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:54,132
And leave for the land of happiness

530
00:35:15,286 --> 00:35:16,321
Go in.

531
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:20,325
- Jung Hee. - Yes?

532
00:35:20,325 --> 00:35:23,661
To be honest, I was moved that other time.

533
00:35:24,929 --> 00:35:28,133
When we were punished and had to take laps,

534
00:35:28,933 --> 00:35:31,936
you took my hand and ran with me.

535
00:35:32,804 --> 00:35:34,572
That's when I decided...

536
00:35:34,806 --> 00:35:38,176
that I'd become best friends with you.

537
00:35:40,912 --> 00:35:41,913
Jung Hee.

538
00:35:43,281 --> 00:35:46,050
We're friends now, right?

539
00:35:46,518 --> 00:35:47,519
What?

540
00:35:50,388 --> 00:35:52,490
What a pretty bag.

541
00:35:54,225 --> 00:35:56,361
I made it in junior high.

542
00:35:56,561 --> 00:35:59,097
Is that right? You're talented.

543
00:36:03,535 --> 00:36:05,970
I'll see you at school.

544
00:36:06,971 --> 00:36:07,972
Okay.

545
00:36:14,212 --> 00:36:15,847
Good night, friend.

546
00:36:16,748 --> 00:36:17,749
Sure.

547
00:36:20,652 --> 00:36:21,853
That moment,

548
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,157
I became very ashamed for how jealous I was...

549
00:36:26,191 --> 00:36:27,992
of Hae Joo the past week.

550
00:36:32,997 --> 00:36:35,767
And that's when I realized...

551
00:36:35,934 --> 00:36:39,938
that I also wanted to be good friends with her.

552
00:36:47,612 --> 00:36:48,613
Jung Hee.

553
00:36:51,883 --> 00:36:53,651
- What is it? - Open it.

554
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,962
You said you liked it,

555
00:37:03,962 --> 00:37:05,330
so I made it last night.

556
00:37:05,663 --> 00:37:08,333
It's to commemorate our becoming friends.

557
00:37:09,601 --> 00:37:10,702
May I really...

558
00:37:12,003 --> 00:37:13,571
accept this?

559
00:37:14,138 --> 00:37:15,740
Of course, you may.

560
00:37:18,443 --> 00:37:19,711
Joint?

561
00:37:20,345 --> 00:37:21,613
With Gyeryoon High?

562
00:37:21,613 --> 00:37:22,614
Yes.

563
00:37:22,914 --> 00:37:24,515
So...

564
00:37:24,515 --> 00:37:27,385
they're coming here tomorrow afternoon.

565
00:37:27,852 --> 00:37:29,787
With their student body president.

566
00:37:29,787 --> 00:37:31,289
The student body president?

567
00:37:31,456 --> 00:37:32,790
As in, Son Jin?

568
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,058
Yes.

569
00:37:34,325 --> 00:37:36,327
I'm going crazy.

570
00:37:36,327 --> 00:37:37,662
Yes.

571
00:37:37,662 --> 00:37:39,764
- Jin? - Son Jin is coming?

572
00:37:39,764 --> 00:37:42,533
- He's coming here? - My heart is racing.

573
00:37:42,533 --> 00:37:44,535
This is a chance of a lifetime.

574
00:37:44,535 --> 00:37:46,304
That's right.

575
00:37:46,471 --> 00:37:47,939
While preparing the show,

576
00:37:47,939 --> 00:37:51,342
you and Jin can naturally...

577
00:37:51,976 --> 00:37:53,811
get closer.

578
00:37:55,346 --> 00:37:56,681
It's too soon to relax.

579
00:37:57,015 --> 00:37:59,050
- Why? - Hae Joo.

580
00:37:59,751 --> 00:38:02,420
That pretty Seoul girl may be an obstacle.

581
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,955
What do you mean?

582
00:38:03,955 --> 00:38:06,324
Hae Joo and I are friends now.

583
00:38:06,891 --> 00:38:08,493
She'd never do that.

584
00:38:08,493 --> 00:38:11,863
What does it matter if she's good?

585
00:38:11,963 --> 00:38:14,232
How could you say that...

586
00:38:14,332 --> 00:38:17,201
after seeing the mob outside the school?

587
00:38:23,408 --> 00:38:24,676
You're right.

588
00:38:24,676 --> 00:38:26,511
All boys are the same.

589
00:38:26,511 --> 00:38:28,413
If they see a pretty girl,

590
00:38:28,413 --> 00:38:31,282
they become complete idiots.

591
00:38:31,282 --> 00:38:33,017
Then what?

592
00:38:33,017 --> 00:38:36,387
What if Son Jin falls for Hae Joo too?

593
00:38:36,821 --> 00:38:38,056
What?

594
00:38:47,865 --> 00:38:49,033
Jin.

595
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,475
He can't!

596
00:38:57,709 --> 00:38:59,911
- That's right. He can't. - That's right. He can't.

597
00:39:00,244 --> 00:39:01,479
There's only one way.

598
00:39:01,846 --> 00:39:03,514
The Jang Hui Bin tactic.

599
00:39:03,781 --> 00:39:05,183
The Jang Hui Bin tactic?

600
00:39:05,249 --> 00:39:07,852
Jang Hui Bin hid all the pretty court ladies...

601
00:39:07,852 --> 00:39:09,954
where the king couldn't see them.

602
00:39:09,954 --> 00:39:12,023
In case the king...

603
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:14,092
would like them?

604
00:39:14,325 --> 00:39:15,660
- That's right. - Then...

605
00:39:15,994 --> 00:39:18,262
we should hide Hae Joo where Jin...

606
00:39:18,496 --> 00:39:20,031
won't see her?

607
00:39:20,865 --> 00:39:22,266
No.

608
00:39:22,633 --> 00:39:24,702
I can't do something so cheap.

609
00:39:25,436 --> 00:39:27,372
Do you want to lose him?

610
00:39:27,772 --> 00:39:30,808
Still. I can't do that.

611
00:39:31,976 --> 00:39:33,845
Don't get blood on your hands.

612
00:39:34,312 --> 00:39:37,115
We'll do it in the name of friendship.

613
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,654
Where's Hae Joo?

614
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:48,559
There was some stuff in our class.

615
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:49,594
Really?

616
00:39:49,961 --> 00:39:52,864
Why today? The Gyeryoon guys are coming today.

617
00:39:58,036 --> 00:39:59,203
(Self Study)

618
00:39:59,203 --> 00:40:00,471
Look at you.

619
00:40:00,905 --> 00:40:02,740
Sit straight.

620
00:40:03,241 --> 00:40:05,610
- X becomes... - I should kill you.

621
00:40:06,711 --> 00:40:07,745
Do you understand?

622
00:40:08,913 --> 00:40:10,782
I get it now.

623
00:40:11,015 --> 00:40:12,884
I couldn't understand a thing...

624
00:40:12,884 --> 00:40:15,053
when Eun Ja tried to teach me.

625
00:40:15,286 --> 00:40:16,921
Now, I get it.

626
00:40:17,655 --> 00:40:18,689
Good.

627
00:40:20,324 --> 00:40:21,692
What do you need?

628
00:40:23,861 --> 00:40:25,263
Thanks, Hae Joo.

629
00:40:25,463 --> 00:40:29,033
If we don't get their math grades up,

630
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,869
Mr. Oh said he'd kill us all too.

631
00:40:33,805 --> 00:40:34,806
Hae Joo.

632
00:40:35,206 --> 00:40:36,974
Don't you have to go to the broadcasting club?

633
00:40:37,575 --> 00:40:38,676
Oh no.

634
00:40:39,343 --> 00:40:41,579
- I'm late. - Hae Joo.

635
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:43,614
Can you teach me this too?

636
00:40:43,614 --> 00:40:45,583
Wait. Me too. Me too.

637
00:40:45,583 --> 00:40:47,351
I need help with so many problems.

638
00:40:49,454 --> 00:40:51,522
This isn't right.

639
00:40:53,724 --> 00:40:54,926
Jung Hee.

640
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:58,062
This goes against your fair-play attitude.

641
00:40:59,864 --> 00:41:01,165
They're coming!

642
00:41:01,532 --> 00:41:03,201
- They're coming. - Really?

643
00:41:03,201 --> 00:41:05,036
- He's really cute. - Wow.

644
00:41:06,904 --> 00:41:09,974
- He really handsome. - He is.

645
00:41:10,341 --> 00:41:11,809
He's so good-looking.

646
00:41:12,176 --> 00:41:14,846
- Jin. - He's so good-looking.

647
00:41:17,748 --> 00:41:19,750
- Hello. - Nice to meet you.

648
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:22,453
- Hello. - Hello.

649
00:41:22,887 --> 00:41:24,689
- Hello. - Hello.

650
00:41:24,789 --> 00:41:26,724
Hello. It's nice to meet you.

651
00:41:26,724 --> 00:41:30,461
- Hello. - Hello.

652
00:41:30,495 --> 00:41:31,662
Jin.

653
00:41:32,263 --> 00:41:34,632
Are you ignoring me?

654
00:41:38,803 --> 00:41:39,904
We meet again.

655
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:42,974
This must be fate.

656
00:41:47,845 --> 00:41:51,282
We're estimating about 150 people.

657
00:41:51,682 --> 00:41:53,184
- 150? - Yes.

658
00:41:53,518 --> 00:41:56,220
Let's use the auditorium here for the venue.

659
00:41:56,387 --> 00:41:59,490
"Fate." He said it was fate.

660
00:41:59,824 --> 00:42:01,225
What could he mean?

661
00:42:01,659 --> 00:42:04,462
Did he miss me too?

662
00:42:04,929 --> 00:42:06,364
Does he...

663
00:42:12,537 --> 00:42:15,039
I think we have about a week left.

664
00:42:15,306 --> 00:42:17,074
Jung Hee...

665
00:42:17,241 --> 00:42:19,343
should be with Jin by now, right?

666
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:22,413
She must be so grateful for our friendship,

667
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,783
since we're holding Hae Joo here like this.

668
00:42:32,823 --> 00:42:34,091
Where's Hae Joo?

669
00:42:37,161 --> 00:42:39,096
Ki Ryuh, where's Hae Joo?

670
00:42:39,096 --> 00:42:40,932
She had to run to the broadcasting club.

671
00:42:40,932 --> 00:42:42,033
- What? - What?

672
00:42:42,633 --> 00:42:46,070
Let's have a student from each school be the host.

673
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:47,271
Okay.

674
00:42:47,271 --> 00:42:49,440
We decided to have me be the host.

675
00:42:49,574 --> 00:42:50,741
What about you?

676
00:42:52,243 --> 00:42:53,611
For us...

677
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:00,184
Excuse me.

678
00:43:12,163 --> 00:43:13,598
I'm glad you're here.

679
00:43:14,365 --> 00:43:17,702
Which of you do you think should host the show?

680
00:43:17,868 --> 00:43:19,470
Maybe Hae Joo should do it.

681
00:43:19,804 --> 00:43:22,173
She's smart and speaks...

682
00:43:22,173 --> 00:43:23,574
with a Seoul accent.

683
00:43:23,741 --> 00:43:26,244
And she's pretty and tall.

684
00:43:27,612 --> 00:43:28,746
She's perfect.

685
00:43:30,281 --> 00:43:34,118
I believe Jung Hee should do it.

686
00:43:35,052 --> 00:43:36,921
This is Daegu.

687
00:43:38,055 --> 00:43:39,924
I believe Jung Hee who speaks...

688
00:43:39,924 --> 00:43:42,760
with a pretty Daegu accent should be the host.

689
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,362
Jung Hee, what do you think?

690
00:43:48,165 --> 00:43:50,434
Obviously, I want to do it...

691
00:43:50,635 --> 00:43:51,936
with Jin.

692
00:43:54,705 --> 00:43:57,408
- I think Hae Joo... - I also think...

693
00:43:58,576 --> 00:44:00,911
Jung Hee should do it.

694
00:44:01,912 --> 00:44:05,583
It's a joint broadcast representing Daegu,

695
00:44:10,054 --> 00:44:13,591
so the host should show off Daegu's charm.

696
00:44:13,691 --> 00:44:16,961
Jin is looking at me.

697
00:44:16,961 --> 00:44:18,496
Only at me.

698
00:44:18,763 --> 00:44:20,231
Then let's do that.

699
00:44:21,265 --> 00:44:22,433
Okay.

700
00:44:23,367 --> 00:44:24,769
Let's work hard.

701
00:44:28,072 --> 00:44:29,240
Thank you.

702
00:44:31,575 --> 00:44:32,743
Thank you.

703
00:44:35,313 --> 00:44:36,781
Thank you.

704
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:43,888
Hae Joo.

705
00:44:45,189 --> 00:44:46,457
I'm sorry.

706
00:44:47,224 --> 00:44:48,326
What?

707
00:44:50,561 --> 00:44:53,030
No. You're great.

708
00:44:54,765 --> 00:44:57,034
I can't wait for the broadcast.

709
00:44:57,134 --> 00:44:58,769
That's not it.

710
00:45:00,204 --> 00:45:03,908
I really am shameless.

711
00:45:11,115 --> 00:45:13,551
Let's meet by Daeil Books at Jungang Market.

712
00:45:14,185 --> 00:45:16,120
I'll wait until 5:30.

713
00:45:17,421 --> 00:45:19,590
Hae Joo. I have to go.

714
00:45:19,824 --> 00:45:20,825
What?

715
00:45:21,292 --> 00:45:22,393
Jung Hee.

716
00:45:25,663 --> 00:45:26,731
Sir.

717
00:45:27,631 --> 00:45:28,999
Here.

718
00:45:29,533 --> 00:45:30,701
Get home safely.

719
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,241
Hello.

720
00:45:41,412 --> 00:45:42,780
I can't give you medicine.

721
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,782
The pharmacist is out.

722
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:47,618
I see.

723
00:45:51,789 --> 00:45:55,292
Our school is having a broadcasting show.

724
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:04,301
Here's an invitation.

725
00:46:09,273 --> 00:46:11,909
Okay. I'll give it to the pharmacist.

726
00:46:11,909 --> 00:46:14,111
No, it's for you, mister.

727
00:46:18,682 --> 00:46:21,051
You fixed our gutter last time.

728
00:46:21,886 --> 00:46:23,220
I wanted to thank you.

729
00:46:27,158 --> 00:46:29,760
Please come if you have time.

730
00:46:33,864 --> 00:46:35,132
Where's Eng Cho?

731
00:46:35,833 --> 00:46:37,701
Did she go somewhere?

732
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:40,671
She's napping.

733
00:46:40,971 --> 00:46:42,540
I see.

734
00:46:44,842 --> 00:46:45,910
Okay then.

735
00:46:49,013 --> 00:46:50,281
Also,

736
00:46:53,551 --> 00:46:54,785
I'm not a "mister".

737
00:47:01,792 --> 00:47:03,060
Have a nice day.

(Jeonghyeon and Gyeryoon Joint Broadcast Show)

739
00:47:22,813 --> 00:47:24,081
Park Hae Joo.

740
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:36,093
Jung Hee, you brat. Why didn't you see it sooner?

741
00:47:39,864 --> 00:47:40,931
Jin!

742
00:47:47,705 --> 00:47:50,407
I only saw this now.

743
00:47:51,075 --> 00:47:52,643
Did you wait long?

744
00:47:53,244 --> 00:47:54,411
I'm sorry.

745
00:47:54,411 --> 00:47:57,348
It's okay. You're all wet.

746
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:01,051
It's okay.

747
00:48:01,252 --> 00:48:02,419
But sorry,

748
00:48:03,153 --> 00:48:04,822
I have to go tutor.

749
00:48:07,791 --> 00:48:10,661
Here. Take this with you.

750
00:48:11,161 --> 00:48:12,429
What about you?

751
00:48:12,496 --> 00:48:15,366
I'm fine. Don't fall again.

752
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,535
See you again.

753
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:30,514
Jin just wanted to see me one more time.

754
00:48:31,615 --> 00:48:32,850
I'm sure of it.

755
00:48:44,828 --> 00:48:47,131
I could see deep in his eyes...

756
00:48:47,531 --> 00:48:49,133
just how...

757
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,368
he felt.

758
00:48:53,304 --> 00:48:54,438
Have you gone insane?

759
00:48:54,438 --> 00:48:55,906
Can't you see it stopped raining?

760
00:48:57,474 --> 00:48:59,243
- I see. - What?

761
00:48:59,743 --> 00:49:03,180
Then why are you walking with the umbrella open?

762
00:49:04,381 --> 00:49:06,650
It's none of your business.

763
00:49:11,789 --> 00:49:13,457
She's completely insane.

764
00:49:13,991 --> 00:49:16,927
She's gone insane after chasing Jin.

765
00:49:17,928 --> 00:49:19,229
Jung Hee.

766
00:49:20,431 --> 00:49:23,367
Wait. Does she still like Jin?

767
00:49:24,902 --> 00:49:26,070
"Still"?

768
00:49:26,437 --> 00:49:29,239
She's falling deeper and deeper.

769
00:49:29,239 --> 00:49:31,976
She'll be crying her heart out soon.

770
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:48,993
Here's an invitation.

771
00:49:49,326 --> 00:49:52,062
Please come if you have time.

772

Young Choon.

774
00:50:01,572 --> 00:50:02,673
Long time no see.

775
00:50:04,842 --> 00:50:06,610
You heard I got out, right?

776
00:50:07,344 --> 00:50:08,412
Ae Sook told you.

777
00:50:08,912 --> 00:50:11,682
I heard you ignored her when she told you.

778
00:50:12,116 --> 00:50:13,283
Is that right?

779
00:50:15,753 --> 00:50:19,189
Come on. A gangster doesn't become a saint...

780
00:50:19,189 --> 00:50:20,491
by living like this.

781
00:50:25,429 --> 00:50:26,430
Move.

782
00:50:27,598 --> 00:50:28,999
You coward.

783
00:50:35,072 --> 00:50:36,073
What?

784
00:50:39,209 --> 00:50:40,210
Happy?

785
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:41,311
Go.

786
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:52,056
Young Choon. That hurts.

787
00:50:52,056 --> 00:50:53,157
Hey, "friend".

788
00:50:54,291 --> 00:50:56,593
Don't mess with me. I'll kill you.

789
00:51:04,635 --> 00:51:05,769
Jung Hee.

790
00:51:06,904 --> 00:51:08,138
What are you doing?

791
00:51:12,409 --> 00:51:13,410
Auntie.

792
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:17,181
What...

793
00:51:18,615 --> 00:51:20,617
Gosh.

794
00:51:21,452 --> 00:51:24,822
Oh my gosh. Are you just getting home?

795
00:51:30,427 --> 00:51:31,662
Why didn't you come?

796
00:51:32,996 --> 00:51:34,631
I'm sorry.

797
00:51:34,932 --> 00:51:36,133
Do you...

798
00:51:37,634 --> 00:51:39,803
Are you just getting home?

799
00:51:39,803 --> 00:51:40,804
Yes.

800
00:51:40,804 --> 00:51:43,440
Gosh. Did you drink...

801
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:44,842
again?

802
00:51:44,842 --> 00:51:46,009
What?

803
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:48,011
Are you sleeping already?

804
00:51:48,245 --> 00:51:49,680
Darn it.

805
00:51:50,881 --> 00:51:53,550
Why is he complaining about my sleeping?

806
00:51:56,253 --> 00:51:58,222
What are you doing at this hour?

807
00:51:58,789 --> 00:52:00,491
Something spilled here.

808
00:52:01,959 --> 00:52:03,093
What spilled?

809
00:52:04,828 --> 00:52:06,330
Did you eat?

Hello.

813
00:52:48,972 --> 00:52:51,909
I'm Son Jin, a senior at Gyeryoon High,

814
00:52:51,909 --> 00:52:54,311
and I'll be hosting with Lee Jung Hee today.

Lee Jung Hee!

816

Jung Hee.

817
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:10,861
The club president said to go home...

818
00:53:10,861 --> 00:53:12,162
and get rested up.

819
00:53:12,629 --> 00:53:13,764
I'm fine.

820
00:53:14,932 --> 00:53:17,301
Go home, and rest.

821
00:53:17,301 --> 00:53:19,636
That way, your voice will be nice and fresh.

822
00:53:19,903 --> 00:53:22,339
And you'll look prettier.

823
00:53:23,407 --> 00:53:26,243
Then maybe I'll go to the bath house.

824
00:53:26,677 --> 00:53:28,312
Yes, that would be good.

00:53:44,561 --> 00:53:46,730
- What is it? - "What is it?"

828
00:53:46,763 --> 00:53:48,365
It isn't much.

829
00:53:48,999 --> 00:53:50,434
I wanted to thank you.

830
00:53:51,935 --> 00:53:54,137
My probation ended today.

831
00:53:54,137 --> 00:53:57,741
Thanks to you, I wasted away in detention.

832
00:53:57,741 --> 00:54:00,911
I have a nice red mark on my transcript too.

833
00:54:01,245 --> 00:54:02,512
I told you, it wasn't me.

834
00:54:02,512 --> 00:54:04,882
I didn't tell the teacher on you.

835
00:54:04,882 --> 00:54:06,650
Sure, whatever.

00:54:08,552 --> 00:54:11,321
I hear you're hosting the broadcast show.

838
00:54:12,589 --> 00:54:15,592
- Why? - What perfect timing.

839
00:54:15,926 --> 00:54:17,461
Timing for what?

00:54:27,304 --> 00:54:29,406
Let go.

843
00:54:29,406 --> 00:54:31,842
Jung Hee. Clench your teeth.

844
00:54:31,975 --> 00:54:33,110
Mr. Oh!

845
00:54:34,244 --> 00:54:35,612
- Get her. - Jung Hee!

846
00:54:35,612 --> 00:54:37,014
- Jung Hee! - Jung Hee!

847
00:54:37,014 --> 00:54:39,383
- Jung Hee! - Stop!

849

- Stop! - Get back here!

850
00:54:44,054 --> 00:54:45,789
- Stop! - No!

851
00:54:46,056 --> 00:54:47,591
Stop chasing me!

852
00:54:48,325 --> 00:54:49,993
How long will you chase me?

853
00:54:49,993 --> 00:54:52,429
Stop, Jung Hee! Stop right there!

854
00:54:52,429 --> 00:54:54,264
Stop right there!

855
00:54:54,331 --> 00:54:55,432
No!

856
00:54:55,432 --> 00:54:57,401
- Stop chasing me! - Stop!

857
00:54:58,201 --> 00:54:59,803
Stay away from me!

858
00:54:59,803 --> 00:55:03,273
If I catch you, I'll rip you to shreds.

859
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:16,820
Darn it.

860
00:55:17,054 --> 00:55:18,221
Darn it.

861
00:55:18,655 --> 00:55:20,324
Are you playing with us?

862
00:55:21,558 --> 00:55:23,193
You're a pretty good runner.

863
00:55:23,593 --> 00:55:26,029
Try running all you can.

864
00:55:26,129 --> 00:55:27,597
You're in the palm of my hand.

865
00:55:27,597 --> 00:55:28,765
Don't come any closer.

866
00:55:29,633 --> 00:55:31,001
"Don't come closer"?

867
00:55:31,601 --> 00:55:33,470
Keep going. It's water.

868
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:34,972
Don't come closer. I'll really fall in.

869
00:55:34,972 --> 00:55:37,474
Then fall in. You'll fall in, not me.

870
00:55:37,975 --> 00:55:39,543
Are you insane?

871
00:55:39,543 --> 00:55:41,611
I'm not insane, you are.

872
00:55:41,611 --> 00:55:43,680
Was it fun, tattling on me to the teacher?

873
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,182
What do you take me for?

874
00:55:48,752 --> 00:55:50,220
Did you just duck?

875
00:55:51,888 --> 00:55:53,223
Hold her down.

876
00:55:53,223 --> 00:55:55,092
You psycho.

877
00:55:55,325 --> 00:55:57,160
- Jung Hee! - Stop it!

878
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,161
Hey!

879
00:55:58,428 --> 00:55:59,763
Why you...

880
00:56:10,741 --> 00:56:11,975
Help me!

881
00:56:14,511 --> 00:56:17,014
- Someone help me! - Look at her.

882
00:56:17,781 --> 00:56:18,949
Are you a frog?

883
00:56:18,949 --> 00:56:20,884
I really can't swim!

884
00:56:20,884 --> 00:56:23,687
Jung Hee really can't swim.

885
00:56:25,789 --> 00:56:27,891
Hey. You go in.

886
00:56:27,891 --> 00:56:29,393
I can't swim.

887
00:56:31,862 --> 00:56:35,365
Jin. I guess this is how I die.

888
00:56:35,365 --> 00:56:37,701
I didn't get to share my love with you.

889
00:56:37,701 --> 00:56:39,803
I guess I'm going to die first.

890
00:56:39,903 --> 00:56:42,339
She's drowning! Oh, no!

891
00:56:46,109 --> 00:56:48,178
Jin?

892
00:56:48,578 --> 00:56:49,713
Jung Hee!

893
00:56:49,913 --> 00:56:51,248
Jung Hee!

894
00:56:57,054 --> 00:56:58,321
Jin.

895
00:57:18,241 --> 00:57:19,743
I'm so happy.

896
00:57:20,343 --> 00:57:23,413
I can die now, and I'll be happy.

897
00:57:42,032 --> 00:57:44,701
Jung Hee. Wake up.

898
00:57:45,202 --> 00:57:46,636
Jung Hee.

899
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:48,805
Jung Hee.

900
00:57:48,805 --> 00:57:51,241
You need to give her CPR.

901
00:57:51,641 --> 00:57:53,143
Do it.

902
00:57:53,143 --> 00:57:55,078
What did they say to do?

903
00:57:55,078 --> 00:57:56,346
I don't know.

904
00:57:56,746 --> 00:57:59,783
Get the water out. Press down on her chest.

905
00:57:59,783 --> 00:58:01,251
That's right. Get the water out!

906
00:58:01,251 --> 00:58:02,719
You do it then!

907
00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:03,820
- You do it! - You do it!

908
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:06,690
- You do it! - Hurry!

909
00:58:07,057 --> 00:58:09,693
How can I do that?

910
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,661
You do it.

911
00:58:12,529 --> 00:58:13,530
- Hey. - You do it.

912
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:15,232
Hey!

913
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,201
Darn it.

914
00:58:19,569 --> 00:58:20,704
Jung Hee.

915
00:58:21,138 --> 00:58:23,173
Don't die. Jung Hee.

916
00:58:27,511 --> 00:58:28,512
Jung Hee.

917
00:58:29,112 --> 00:58:30,180
Sorry.

918
00:58:30,981 --> 00:58:33,183
I'll take care of you no matter what.

919
00:58:49,766 --> 00:58:51,601
Jung Hee.

920
00:58:54,171 --> 00:58:55,205
Jung Hee.

921
00:58:56,706 --> 00:58:59,176
Jung Hee. No, no, no.

922
00:58:59,176 --> 00:59:00,844
Jung Hee.

923
00:59:04,014 --> 00:59:05,115
No.

924
00:59:07,517 --> 00:59:09,052
Mouth-to-mouth.

925
00:59:11,388 --> 00:59:12,455
Commencing.

926
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,603
Is this... Mouth-to-mouth?

927
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:30,440
Does that mean these are Jin's lips?

928
00:59:36,413 --> 00:59:39,282
Jung Hee! Jung Hee, are you okay?

929
00:59:39,349 --> 00:59:41,685
Are you awake? Jung Hee.

930
00:59:41,952 --> 00:59:44,454
You're alive. You're alive. Jung Hee.

931
00:59:44,554 --> 00:59:47,324
I'm so glad. You're alive.

932
00:59:48,925 --> 00:59:50,594
I was so scared.

933
00:59:50,927 --> 00:59:52,429
I'm so glad.

934
01:00:11,381 --> 01:00:14,117
Mom! Jung Hee's awake!

935
01:00:14,451 --> 01:00:15,552
- What? - Jung Hee!

936
01:00:15,619 --> 01:00:17,721
My baby girl!

937
01:00:18,154 --> 01:00:19,923
Are you finally awake?

938
01:00:19,923 --> 01:00:21,825
- Jung Hee. - Mom.

939
01:00:22,292 --> 01:00:25,061
- Where am I? - It's a hospital! Look!

940
01:00:25,595 --> 01:00:27,430
You brat!

941
01:00:27,731 --> 01:00:29,766
Do we not have water...

942
01:00:29,766 --> 01:00:31,901
at the house?

943
01:00:31,901 --> 01:00:34,404
Why were you drinking water from the river?

944
01:00:36,072 --> 01:00:38,708
- Where's Jin? - What about him?

945
01:00:38,708 --> 01:00:40,910
Where's Jin, who saved me?

946
01:00:41,244 --> 01:00:43,680
You brat. Don't even get me started.

947
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,682
Because of you, you brat,

948
01:00:45,682 --> 01:00:47,550
another family's precious son...

949
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:50,320
almost drowned and died.

950
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:51,821
How can I face his parents now?

951
01:00:51,821 --> 01:00:54,591
Dong Moon is hospitalized next door! Dong Moon!

952
01:00:56,726 --> 01:00:59,129
No way. The one who saved me...

953
01:00:59,129 --> 01:01:02,499
You may have died if not for Dong Moon.

954
01:01:14,344 --> 01:01:15,979
Shoot.

955
01:01:16,846 --> 01:01:19,249
Shoot. That's right.

956
01:01:19,949 --> 01:01:22,452
- I have to take a bath. - You crazy wench!

957
01:01:22,452 --> 01:01:25,221
You want to go into water again?

958
01:01:25,221 --> 01:01:27,457
I have to take a bath before tomorrow's show.

959
01:01:27,457 --> 01:01:29,259
The broadcast show ended already!

960
01:01:29,259 --> 01:01:31,461
What do you mean? It's tomorrow.

961
01:01:32,095 --> 01:01:33,830
Today is "tomorrow".

962
01:01:33,997 --> 01:01:36,933
You slept for over a day!

963
01:01:37,434 --> 01:01:40,103
- Today is "tomorrow"? - That's right.

964
01:01:40,704 --> 01:01:41,905
Is that true?

965
01:01:42,539 --> 01:01:44,574
- It is. - No.

966
01:01:44,941 --> 01:01:46,976
No. No!

967
01:01:47,177 --> 01:01:48,345
No what?

968
01:01:48,912 --> 01:01:51,614
- Hey! Hey! - Hey! Jung Hee!

969
01:01:51,781 --> 01:01:54,184
Get back here!

970
01:01:59,289 --> 01:02:01,057
Get your act together, you brat!

971
01:02:29,552 --> 01:02:30,920
It really...

972
01:02:33,289 --> 01:02:35,158
is over.

973
01:02:42,999 --> 01:02:44,100
Hae Joo.

974
01:02:45,034 --> 01:02:46,202
Don't do this.

975
01:02:48,671 --> 01:02:50,273
Please don't do this.

976
01:02:52,342 --> 01:02:54,244
Can't you think it over?

977
01:02:55,979 --> 01:02:57,113
I'm sorry.

978
01:02:58,181 --> 01:02:59,449
Why...

979
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:01,851
don't you understand how I feel?

980
01:03:05,722 --> 01:03:07,090
Jin.

981
01:03:08,491 --> 01:03:09,592
Hae Joo?

982
01:03:12,095 --> 01:03:13,263
Are they...

983
01:03:14,497 --> 01:03:15,932
dating?

984
01:03:17,267 --> 01:03:18,768
Did Jin...

985
01:03:19,803 --> 01:03:21,971
fall for her too?

986
01:03:30,013 --> 01:03:31,181
Jung Hee.
