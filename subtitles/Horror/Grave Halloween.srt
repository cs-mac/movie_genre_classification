1
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,700
Mother?

2
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,470
Maiko.

3
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,580
Mother?

4
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,750
Maiko.

5
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,500
Maiko!

6
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,500
Okasan.

7
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,060
No!

8
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,050
Oh, my God.

9
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,850
Heh, you scared
the hell out of me.

10
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,650
Me?
Yeah.

11
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,890
Anyway, happy
Halloween to you.

12
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,320
Yeah, you too.

13
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:57,530
You having any second
thoughts about today?

14
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,030
No. Why?

15
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,170
You know, you can tell me
if you are.

16
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,600
I don't.

17
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,570
Okay. Ah, well, I'll
meet you downstairs in 20?

18
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,240
Okay, because we are
burning daylight,

19
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,640
as they say in the biz.

20
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,180
Heh, of course.

21
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,710
Okay.

22
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,060
This is why it's not fair
for a professor to assign teams.

23
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,870
I can't believe
they would just not show--

24
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,770
Well, well,
Mr. Punctuality.

25
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,410
I know, I know.
I'm sorry.

26
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,610
Where the hell have you been?
Hey, Maiko.

27
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,310
Terry.

28
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,180
Okay, don't freak out.

29
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,580
Why would I freak out?

30
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,110
Sean's not coming.

31
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,280
- What?
- It's okay, I fixed it.

32
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,420
Where is he?

33
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,690
Something about
a party in the city?

34
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,220
He took the camera.

35
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,160
Are you kidding me?

36
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,360
I got a ringer,
from the Film Department.

37
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,260
Terry, we've been planning
this for weeks.

38
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,630
Look, he's got
his own camera.

39
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,600
I've seen his reel,
he's got freakish talent.

40
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,540
It's fine with me either way,
but I gotta head out.

41
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,610
I brought him up to speed on
everything. Go with the flow.

42
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,140
The flow.

43
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,780
What flow? Terry,
this is my term project.

44
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,740
You must be Maiko.

45
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,210
Kidding.

46
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,980
That's Maiko.
I'm Kyle.

47
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,820
So I hear
we're making a doc.

48
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,920
And we're rolling.

49
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,520
Already?

50
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,990
Yeah, you know, start
of the journey and all that.

51
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,330
Okay, um...

52
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,390
What do you want
me to say?

53
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,630
Well, just

54
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:16,630
tell us who you are
and what we're doing.

55
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,800
Try to relax.

56
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:27,140
Well, my name is Maiko

57
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,740
and today we're going to look
for my birth mother.

58
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,310
Her body actually.

59
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,810
She committed suicide
two months ago.

60
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,150
I guess I've been looking
my whole life

61
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,920
but, um, I...

62
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,920
Cut.

63
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,550
Really, Craig?

64
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,990
Oh, I'm sorry,
are you guys shooting?

65
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,260
No, just talking to myself.

66
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,990
What's up, guys?

67
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,630
Ooh, nice camera.
Trick or treat?

68
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,030
I'm good, thanks.

69
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,470
We can just finish
this in the car.

70
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,470
Are you sure?
Yes, Craig, we're sure.

71
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,900
Where's your
third stooge?

72
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,140
Brody's off
on a mission.

73
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,540
Official business.
Mm-hm. Yeah.

74
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,280
So you guys still going
to go chill some corpses?

75
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,250
Because today's
a really good day for it.

76
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,280
Whatever.

77
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,010
- That was out of line.
- Relax.

78
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:23,880
I'm just saying this place could
be full of some creepy stuff.

79
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:27,120
Yeah, or maybe they're full
of real people with problems,

80
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,390
who thought they
had no other choice.

81
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,960
You guys coming?

82
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,430
Maybe.

83
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,960
Nice, Skylar.

84
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,790
Real nice.

85
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,060
What did I say?
You said nothing.

86
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,500
Just cool, man.

87
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,530
See you.

88
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,080
So where are we now?

89
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,920
We're, uh, ahem, heading up
the Fuji panorama line.

90
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,360
It's the road
that takes us to Mount Fuji.

91
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,730
But, uh,
before you get there,

92
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,790
it passes a forest
called Aokigahara.

93
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:25,200
Some people call it
Sea of Trees.

94
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,170
But it has another name,
doesn't it?

95
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,900
Yeah.

96
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,140
The Suicide Forest.

97
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,010
More people take their lives
in this forest

98
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:38,810
than anywhere else
in the world.

99
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:46,420
And you have a personal tie
to this place, don't you?

100
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,850
Your mother?

101
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,760
Maiko, it's okay.

102
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,490
This is important stuff.

103
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,090
I know, it's...
It's not that, I just...

104
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,070
We can hold off for a bit.

105
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,100
There'll be better scenery
when we get there, anyways.

106
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,070
Yeah.

107
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,640
Should we cut?

108
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,740
Ahem, excuse me, Colin?
It's Kyle.

109
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,510
Right. I appreciate you
filling in, I really do

110
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,150
but let's leave the directorial
decisions to me, okay?

111
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,420
<i> ¶ Twinkle, twinkle,</i>
<i> Little star ¶</i>

112
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,440
<i> Maiko?</i>

113
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,880
Maiko? The turn
is right there.

114
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,020
- What?
- Turn.

115
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,520
- What the hell?
- I know. I'm sorry.

116
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,420
Sorry.

117
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,300
We're here.

118
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,360
What is it?

119
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,130
Uh, nothing.

120
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,150
Uh, what are you doing?

121
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,190
Are you kidding me?
That car's golden.

122
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,490
Well, at least he's eager.

123
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,260
Wow.

124
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,070
What does that say?

125
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,710
It's a suicide manual.

126
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,550
Looks like they could use
a car repair manual.

127
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,950
No, don't.

128
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,350
You're not supposed to disturb
anything from the dead.

129
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,420
It's just a car.

130
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,890
Yeah, but it belonged to someone
who probably died here.

131
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,460
You're the boss.

132
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,360
We can still use it
as our backdrop.

133
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,190
Ready, Maiko?

134
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,470
This is the only clue I have
as to where she took her life.

135
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:27,510
This one photograph.

136
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,680
It's really important that
we try and find this place.

137
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:37,880
This one tree.

138
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,260
Let's grab our packs,
I'll show you the way in.

139
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,260
This way.

140
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,030
"Your life is a precious gift
from your parents.

141
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,500
Please think about your parents,
siblings and children.

142
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,770
Don't keep it to yourself.

143
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,140
Talk about your troubles."

144
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,880
There's a number
for a suicide hotline.

145
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,090
Last year, it was close
to 100 people

146
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,890
who took their lives
in this forest.

147
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,960
Tortured souls in life,
made worse in death

148
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,090
without having
a proper burial.

149
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:20,160
Today, I'm gonna try
and fix that

150
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,900
for one person at least.

151
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,070
My mother.

152
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,970
That was great.

153
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,350
What kind of wildlife
you think they got here?

154
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,250
Wildlife?

155
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,520
This place looked a lot
smaller on the map.

156
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,230
Are we gonna talk
about that?

157
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,530
Who's gonna stop us?

158
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,940
Hide the camera. Just hide.
What?

159
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,300
Whoa.

160
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,750
Okay, I think we're good.

161
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,380
What were they doing?

162
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,250
Clean out the forest
of the dead bodies.

163
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,290
They also try to return personal
items to family members.

164
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,760
It's how I got this.

165
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,390
No, no!

166
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,460
It's not wise to come
in here with cameras.

167
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,930
Yeah, we saw the signs.
Oh, you shouldn't be here.

168
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,740
You getting this guy?
He's priceless.

169
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,900
Must be careful.

170
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,540
Very easy to get lost.

171
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,040
Relax, big guy.
No one's getting lost.

172
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,070
We're covered.

173
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,370
Got a compass.
That won't help you.

174
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,880
Not here.

175
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,380
I'm sorry,
who are you?

176
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:27,580
Ugh, Jin.

177
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:31,080
Okay. And you're just
taking a stroll, Jin?

178
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,850
Yeah. I walk the forest.

179
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:42,290
Many people come here to die
but some change their minds.

180
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,590
Why have you come?

181
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,690
To honor my mother.

182
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:50,730
Oh, she seeks
a proper burial.

183
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,370
Go ahead.

184
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,140
Segaki ceremony.

185
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,910
That's why we're here.

186
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,440
Good.

187
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,910
Many who come here have
no chance at eternal peace.

188
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:10,310
So how well
do you know the forest?

189
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,420
Um, I know it well.

190
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:21,060
I believe this is where she
took her life. In this spot.

191
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,620
Do you think
you know where it is?

192
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,460
Yes, it's possible.

193
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,730
Not many trees here
like this.

194
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,660
There's one
down by the creek, mm-hm.

195
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,630
Do you think
you could show us?

196
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,470
Yes, I can show you.

197
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:44,240
But you must
watch your step always.

198
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,440
This is sacred ground.

199
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,540
Many have died here.

200
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:54,480
Touch nothing, take nothing.
Stay close.

201
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,180
And keep your hands and feet
inside the car at all times.

202
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,530
I thought
it was funny, heh.

203
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,730
Thank you.

204
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,090
Oh, my God, Terry.

205
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:40,890
What?

206
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,430
I thought...

207
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,630
Never mind.
I thought I saw...

208
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,630
Never mind.
Okay.

209
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,400
What's all this stuff?

210
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,810
People mark their way
in case they get lost

211
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:03,040
so they can find their way out.

212
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,740
Does it help?

213
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:11,280
Sometimes, yes.
Many times, no.

214
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,780
So why this forest?

215
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,290
Some people believe

216
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:22,050
it was because of a popular
novel a few years back.

217
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,390
Glorified this forest's
mystical beauty.

218
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,630
No. People came here
to die long before that.

219
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,800
So I'll ask again.
Why this forest?

220
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,930
No one can say for sure
why they come, but they do.

221
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:42,240
And the more they come, the more
the Yurei are in the trees

222
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,740
the ground and in the air.

223
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,910
The Yurei have a strong draw
to troubled people

224
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:54,250
who are looking for a way out
of this world and into the next.

225
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,810
The Yurei?

226
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,250
The restless souls
of the suicide victims.

227
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:03,190
They're like,
uh, angry ghosts.

228
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,390
That's what the Segaki
ceremony is about.

229
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:08,290
It's a ritual performed
on October 31st

230
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:12,630
which, ironically,
is Halloween.

231
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:15,200
So, what's this Segaki thing?

232
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:19,330
It helps the tortured soul
move on to the afterworld

233
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,930
rather than fall onto the world
of the Yurei.

234
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:27,440
Why don't you show him
what's in the box?

235
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,380
Okay.

236
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:44,690
These, um...

237
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:47,060
These personal items.

238
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,990
This letter must have meant
a great deal to her.

239
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:55,560
They're important
for the Segaki ceremony.

240
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,370
Of course.

241
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,300
Why don't you read him
the letter?

242
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,870
Um...

243
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,310
Well, it, uh...

244
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:18,310
She says, uh,

245
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,720
she can't stand
living anymore

246
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,620
and that she came here
to die

247
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,860
but she was afraid
of not having a proper burial.

248
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,960
She says, um,

249
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,230
she's sorry
she never knew me.

250
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,770
That I had to grow up
without her

251
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,600
and that she'll
always love me.

252
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,740
You may not have known
your mother in life

253
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:02,910
but with a proper burial,
you will set her free in death.

254
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:10,220
You will give her peace
and you too, hmm.

255
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,380
Be nice if they slowed down
so I could get a shot.

256
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,110
You guys, just keep walking.
This should be great B roll.

257
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,450
Be careful.

258
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,080
It's okay, it's okay.

259
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,590
Watch your step.
Always watch your step.

260
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,520
Okay, um...

261
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:58,430
So, what are you feeling
right now?

262
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,800
Um, I feel like, uh...

263
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,300
Heh, honestly?
Like I have a camera in my face.

264
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,500
Amber!

265
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,180
Oh, my God.
What the hell?

266
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:28,020
Run!
Go, go, go!

267
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,420
Go, go, go!

268
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,290
He's coming!

269
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:50,500
Ow, Maiko. It's me.

270
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,770
Guys. Guys, it's me.

271
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,440
Craig?

272
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,940
Hey, guys.

273
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,570
Right? See that?

274
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:07,180
You should've seen your faces.
Oh, that was...

275
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,410
Happy Halloween.
Heh.

276
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:11,250
You mock the spirits
of the forest.

277
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,150
Relax, man,
it was a joke.

278
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,390
Joke will be on you.

279
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,190
Okay.

280
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,590
Who's this guy?

281
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,260
You could've chosen
a smaller branch.

282
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,020
You think this is funny?
Ugh.

283
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,490
Easy, it was a joke.
Brody!

284
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:29,330
I don't even know what to say,
to any of you. Jin, wait.

285
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,260
How long have you
been planning this?

286
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,530
Since we found out
you were coming.

287
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:36,830
Really?
Happy Halloween.

288
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,370
Grow up.

289
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,140
Maiko.

290
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,400
Just go, okay, guys?

291
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,970
Downer.

292
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:47,440
Heh, jeez, what?
Where is your sense of humor?

293
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,580
Out looking
for your sense of decency.

294
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,250
What? Ugh...

295
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,880
That hurt.

296
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,680
Whatever.
That was funny.

297
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,020
That was awesome!
Funny.

298
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,850
I told you! I told you!
Whoa!

299
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,260
What's next? What's next?

300
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,690
Jin.

301
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,290
Can you believe those idiots?

302
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,620
Yeah, ridiculous.

303
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,060
- Do you see him?
- No.

304
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:15,200
Would you want to hang around
after what those morons did?

305
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:18,760
Hey,

306
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:20,570
are you gonna be able
to continue?

307
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,530
Yeah.

308
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,730
Yeah.

309
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,700
What the...?

310
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,400
Come on.

311
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,870
What do you want me to do?

312
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,440
We got a problem.

313
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,910
What's going on?

314
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,880
Camera's on the fritz
right now.

315
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,980
What do you mean?

316
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,520
Uh, I don't know,
it's just acting weird.

317
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,690
It's just not working
right now.

318
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:55,760
- I don't know. Hold on.
- Must be the battery.

319
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,500
I mean,
what else could it be?

320
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:03,100
Check it down here. Yeah...

321
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,670
There, got it.

322
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:08,670
All right,
let's do that again.

323
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,100
How's that?
Do what again?

324
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,970
Oh, God.

325
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,540
Did you see that?
What?

326
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,180
What? See what?

327
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:27,250
That woman,
she was hanging right there.

328
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:31,120
I...

329
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,260
Okay, okay, play it back.

330
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:39,020
Mik, I don't think
anyone saw anything.

331
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:41,260
I don't...
Just do it.

332
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,030
Kyle, just play it back.

333
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,400
All right,
give me a second.

334
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,010
Shouldn't we be
at the car by now?

335
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,670
I don't know.
You wanna lead?

336
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,440
No, I just...
None of this looks familiar.

337
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,280
What do you think?
We should've brought a map.

338
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,280
No way we're lost, huh?

339
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,780
Okay, the freeway
should be that way.

340
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:12,320
We came from that way, right?
Guys?

341
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,550
Check it out.

342
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,410
Hello?

343
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,110
What the hell is that, man?

344
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:46,250
Hey, Skye,
know what those notes say?

345
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,450
I don't know.

346
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:51,290
Three months
as an exchange student,

347
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:53,620
you'd think I would.
Hello?

348
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,460
Hey, let's just go, man.

349
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,330
Anybody in there?

350
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:36,290
Hey. That's not
a good idea, man.

351
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,140
Can we get the hell out
of here now, please?

352
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,700
Yeah!

353
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,870
Is that a Rolex?
Yeah. Heh, heh.

354
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,910
You're gonna wear
a dead man's watch?

355
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,710
No.

356
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,250
We'll sell it and split it.

357
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:09,550
Yeah, yeah. We should get
lost out here more often.

358
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,600
Hey! Wait up!

359
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:42,310
<i> Okay. Here we go.</i>

360
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,850
<i> All right,</i>
<i> let's do that again.</i>

361
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,380
<i> Do what again?</i>

362
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:54,460
<i>Oh, my God! Did you see that?</i>
<i> What? What? What? See what?</i>

363
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:57,160
<i> That woman, she was hanging</i>
<i> right there.</i>

364
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:03,060
<i> Mik, I don't think</i>
<i> anyone saw anything.</i>

365
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:09,030
<i> Oh, my God! Did you see that?</i>
<i> What? What? What? See what?</i>

366
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,030
<i> That woman she was...</i>

367
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,700
I saw her.
I swear I did.

368
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:15,870
You saw a person.
We're not the only ones here.

369
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:18,940
No. No,
this was different.

370
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,880
Maiko?
Hey!

371
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,850
Guys, come on.

372
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:36,590
Hey!

373
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:40,920
Hey!

374
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,260
Maiko...

375
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,600
Hey!

376
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,610
Maiko?

377
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,790
Are you okay?

378
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,190
- What was it?
- What did you see?

379
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,320
I don't know.

380
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:28,290
- Are you okay?
- I think I just...

381
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:29,990
I got the wind
knocked out of me.

382
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,730
Guys.

383
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,940
I think I'm gonna be sick.

384
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,380
Admit it, we're lost.
Wow.

385
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,180
We're not lost.

386
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,150
Yeah, we are.

387
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:10,660
I hope your little prank
was worth it, Skye.

388
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,690
Skylar?

389
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,530
Skylar?

390
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,530
What did you say, Brody?

391
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,500
Brody?

392
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,100
Craig?

393
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,650
Hey, guys.

394
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:49,520
Hello?

395
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,490
Craig?

396
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,060
Brody?

397
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,450
No! No!

398
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,880
It's a woman.

399
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:08,120
Who's in the picture?

400
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,690
What are you doing?

401
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,960
Hey!

402
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,600
I thought you said we weren't
supposed to disturb the dead.

403
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:27,000
Is it her?

404
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:37,010
Uh, guys?
I hear something.

405
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,580
What are they saying?
They want us out.

406
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,080
They want the camera.
The footage.

407
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,850
Please!

408
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:52,650
Let me explain, I'm just
trying to find my mother.

409
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,660
We're sorry, it's...

410
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:01,560
Hey! You want
the footage? Here.

411
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,430
Kyle, no!

412
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:07,800
Go. Now!

413
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,730
Leave the forest.

414
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:11,600
All right.

415
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:35,350
That was my project, Kyle.
What were you thinking?

416
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,390
Not cool, man.
You could have held out.

417
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:39,960
Really?
I've been shooting gold.

418
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,790
You think I'm gonna
give that up?

419
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,930
Yo, Skylar!

420
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,970
Skylar!

421
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:00,740
Yeah, yeah.
Happy Halloween, man.

422
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,910
You made your point.

423
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:07,010
Hello?

424
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,580
What the hell?

425
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,620
Wait a minute. There!

426
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:36,840
Skylar's phone.

427
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:50,780
What is that?

428
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:57,920
Man.

429
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,450
Dude.

430
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,460
Hey.

431
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,200
Cute trick back there.

432
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,700
Well, what can I say?
I'm a tricky one.

433
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,200
Can I ask you a question?

434
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,170
Why are you doing this doc?

435
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,670
Why am I exploiting
my mother's death

436
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,670
so Amber and Terry
get a good grade?

437
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,510
Not my words, but, yeah.

438
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,750
This is the only thing
I have from my childhood.

439
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:45,560
This is my only picture
of her.

440
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:52,360
I want people to know
that she was real.

441
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,530
She existed.

442
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:55,530
And she's missed.

443
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:59,070
Yeah.

444
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,730
How old were you
when you were adopted?

445
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,140
Young. I was only 4.

446
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,840
Forgive me for asking, but do
you even remember your mother?

447
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,480
Not really.

448
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:18,080
Well, I remember
this one day.

449
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,450
I'm in a garden.

450
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:22,050
<i> Backyard of our house,</i>
<i> I think.</i>

451
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:27,190
I'm on a swing
and I feel free.

452
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:31,890
In my head,
I'm going so high.

453
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:36,060
She's there,
just watching.

454
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:41,830
And then she smiles at me.

455
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,070
Then what happens?

456
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:49,100
I, uh...

457
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,570
I'm not sure.

458
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,940
That's all I can remember.

459
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:58,110
She wasn't well,
from what I know.

460
00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:01,710
Spent most of her life
in institutions.

461
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,180
Now, after all these years,
she reached out to me.

462
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:09,620
Well, I'm honored
to be a part of it.

463
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,290
This is why I want to help.

464
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:13,290
Where did you go?

465
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:17,090
Your friends taunted the dead.

466
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,360
Not wise.

467
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,790
I warned you.

468
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,630
No, they are not
our friends.

469
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:25,560
Help! Help! Anyone!
Do you hear that?

470
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:28,870
Help! Please! Hey! Terry!
There.

471
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,700
Amber! Guys!

472
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,370
Maiko! You have to help us!

473
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:34,270
What are you doing?
Why are you here?

474
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:36,370
Skylar's missing.
Yeah, right.

475
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,810
I'm serious.

476
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,040
He's a big boy,

477
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,510
he's been missing for,
what, 20 minutes?

478
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:44,750
We found this and his pack.

479
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,250
Nothing else.

480
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,450
Is that real blood?

481
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:52,350
It's just another prank. You
don't know when to quit, do you?

482
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:54,950
It's not.
On my life, man.

483
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:57,490
Call his phone.
Yeah, we tried that.

484
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:58,550
It's in his pack.

485
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,560
When did you last see him?

486
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,430
We were headed
towards the car.

487
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:05,630
One second he was there
and then he wasn't.

488
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,000
This whole place
is a maze.

489
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,760
Sometimes you get lost
in the forest.

490
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:12,730
Sometimes the forest
loses you.

491
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:16,570
Huh? Who is this guy?

492
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,700
- If this is another prank, guys--
- It's not.

493
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:23,510
He could be out there lying
unconscious, or worse. Please.

494
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:32,480
Skylar!

495
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,980
You sure
you came from here?

496
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:38,680
I don't know.
Everything looks the same.

497
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:41,250
Skylar!

498
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,120
Would you wait up?

499
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,020
Skylar!
This is a search. Slow down.

500
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:48,030
Screaming like this
will alarm the police.

501
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:50,460
Yeah, but maybe at this point
that's a good thing.

502
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,630
They can help us.

503
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:54,000
How could he just vanish
like that?

504
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,400
- We'll find him, trust me.
- Skylar!

505
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,630
- You found us.
- Skylar!

506
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,900
We'll find him.
Yeah, I don't know.

507
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,170
Look, something's
not right here.

508
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:06,370
Skylar!
Skylar!

509
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:07,940
Yo, Skye!

510
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:14,180
Weren't they just...?

511
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,450
Guys!

512
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,280
Hello?

513
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:23,820
Hey!

514
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,920
This is ridiculous.

515
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,260
You did this to yourselves,
now you're screwing up our day.

516
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,690
What you want me to say?

517
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:31,960
Whether filming or searching,

518
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,890
we gonna be losing
light soon.

519
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:42,700
Craig?

520
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,500
Craig!

521
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:55,310
What does it say?

522
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,980
"Death comes to all."

523
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:03,680
That's super comforting.

524
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:09,990
Come on, guys.
We can't be too far.

525
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:31,770
Hey!

526
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:35,910
Hey!

527
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:50,860
Uh, it doesn't
make any sense.

528
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:53,090
Which way is the sun moving?

529
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,630
Craig?

530
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:10,270
Jeez, man.

531
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:12,340
Relax.

532
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,410
Which way
is the sun moving?

533
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,840
I don't know,
I can't tell.

534
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,180
What do you think?

535
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,680
That way?

536
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,050
I don't know. You're
the one with the compass.

537
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:29,520
Which is useless.

538
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:41,700
What are you doing?

539
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,000
What was that?

540
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,070
What is that, man?
I heard something.

541
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:49,900
Hey, dude,
will you shut up for a second?

542
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:54,440
Who's that?
You see that?

543
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,140
Whoa, what is that?
What is that, a kid?

544
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:58,170
It's...

545
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:01,240
It's, uh, someone.

546
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:03,110
Over here!
What are you doing?

547
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:04,650
Maybe she saw Skylar.

548
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:26,260
Go, go, go!

549
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:30,370
Terry?

550
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:32,070
Skylar!

551
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:33,970
Craig!

552
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:37,510
Hello?

553
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:39,940
Come on, guys!

554
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:49,320
Creepy guy seems
about as lost as us.

555
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:53,320
You do know this place, right?
And we're gonna find everyone?

556
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,590
No.

557
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:57,150
They are now lost.

558
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,520
What?

559
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,290
Excuse me?

560
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:05,360
I tell you to respect the dead,
and you don't listen.

561
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,000
You don't listen!

562
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,430
You and your camera.

563
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:14,830
Is it worth it?

564
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:15,870
And you!

565
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:19,270
What are you talking about?

566
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:22,910
What did you take?

567
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:24,370
Um, I didn't take anything.

568
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:30,340
What did you take?

569
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:32,780
We were on the path
and checking things out.

570
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:35,410
You're lying.
Hey! I didn't take anything!

571
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:45,720
This.

572
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:47,560
Where did you get this?

573
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,260
I don't know
what you're talking about,

574
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,790
that's Skylar's watch.

575
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:58,700
You stole it.

576
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,170
I warned you.

577
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:05,770
I warned all of you.

578
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:07,240
Jin,
what are you talking about?

579
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,240
Relax,
you've got this all wrong.

580
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,010
You are cursed.

581
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:15,110
All of you.

582
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,280
No, Jin! Wait!

583
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,680
Damn it, Brody.

584
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,820
- Jin!
- Maiko!

585
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:22,750
- Stay with her.
- Wait, guys!

586
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,090
What's with the watch?

587
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:28,120
I don't know, heh.
I don't even know that guy.

588
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:30,630
Did you really take something
from a dead person?

589
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:32,890
It wasn't me.
What is wrong with you?

590
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:36,200
God, Brody, just screw off.
It wasn't me, Amber.

591
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,930
It never is, is it?

592
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:42,700
Oh, fine. This is bull.
I-- You want me to leave?

593
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,400
You were never supposed to be
here in the first place.

594
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:46,870
I don't need this crap,
all right?

595
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:49,240
I'll just go look
for him myself.

596
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:54,550
Maiko?

597
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,510
Kyle?

598
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:10,660
Maiko?

599
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:14,660
- Go, go, go! Let's run! Get help.
- We gotta get out of here.

600
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:16,770
- Is she behind us?
- I don't think so.

601
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:19,130
- What was that?
- What's wrong with her?

602
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:21,100
- I don't know.
- We gotta get out of here.

603
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,300
Skylar!

604
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:23,800
He's not here.
He's probably dead!

605
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:25,470
That's not possible!

606
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:41,220
We're going in circles.

607
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:43,250
It's not possible, Terry.

608
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,290
Jin!

609
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,830
He's gone.

610
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:57,100
What?
Why would he run off like that?

611
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,300
I should never have agreed
to do this.

612
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:04,040
It should have been
between me and my mother.

613
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,970
Come on. You couldn't have
known this was gonna happen.

614
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:16,810
Hello?

615
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,820
Run, run, run!

616
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:26,350
Go, go!

617
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:30,420
Run!

618
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:37,660
Whoa, whoa. Hey! Hey!

619
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:40,530
You were warned.
We're sorry. We're sorry.

620
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:41,530
Okay? Just calm down.

621
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,170
Mother?

622
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,300
Maiko.

623
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,340
Mother!

624
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,210
Please, let me go!

625
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,540
- Please, let me go! No!
- No.

626
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:02,010
Stop!

627
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:04,250
No!
Okay, dude!

628
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:06,380
Please!

629
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:09,220
Maiko!

630
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,410
<i> Maiko!</i>

631
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:47,480
<i>- Maiko.</i>
- Don't touch her! No!

632
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,880
Maiko. Maiko!

633
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:53,590
Maiko.

634
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:57,120
Maiko, wake up.

635
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,190
Come on!

636
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:05,160
Maiko! Maiko!

637
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,430
You all right?

638
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,900
Oh, thank God.

639
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:21,310
Where are we?
I don't know.

640
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,980
What's happening?

641
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:29,450
Hey! Hey!

642
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:31,180
We're gonna get out of here,
all right?

643
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:33,120
We're gonna be okay.

644
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:40,320
I saw my mother in the forest,
Kyle.

645
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:43,790
What?

646
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:51,000
I saw her, or her spirit
or something. I saw something.

647
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:55,400
Are you sure?
Yes.

648
00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:04,410
All right.

649
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:09,580
Maiko?

650
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:13,920
Brody?

651
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:18,990
Hello?

652
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:27,860
Hey! Hey, wait!

653
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:37,670
Oh, God.

654
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:50,080
Somebody help me!

655
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,210
Hey!

656
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:56,220
Please, let us out!

657
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:58,990
They don't care about us,
Maiko.

658
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,090
Kyle, she was calling to me.

659
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:07,030
Reaching out to me.

660
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:08,960
I have to help her.

661
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,400
Hey!

662
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:17,870
Quiet!

663
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:21,100
Please, you have to help us.
Our friends are lost.

664
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:24,870
What?
You are thieves.

665
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:29,180
You will pay.

666
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:32,040
No, we didn't steal anything.
That was someone else.

667
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,520
This is yours?

668
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:47,260
Yes. It was my mother's.

669
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:55,500
This is your mother?

670
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,000
What?

671
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,570
No.

672
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:04,970
No.

673
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,810
How about this one?

674
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:17,510
Is this your mother?

675
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,750
No.

676
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:26,320
Hey, what are you doing,
man?

677
00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:33,430
You steal the dead's
belongings.

678
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:36,630
What? No, we didn't steal that.
We didn't steal anything.

679
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:39,970
Those were mailed to me.
They were my mother's.

680
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:42,100
We came here to do Segaki.

681
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,970
Segaki?

682
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:48,740
You want a Segaki?

683
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:53,780
Do Segaki here?

684
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:05,550
Hey! Hey! Hey!

685
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:08,790
Come on, you can't just
leave us here in the dark.

686
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,200
Very quiet.

687
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:29,670
What did he say?

688
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:33,070
What was that,<i> yakuhori?</i>
What does that mean?

689
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,480
Casting out spirits.

690
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,010
It's like an exorcism.

691
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:44,480
Oh, great. Great.

692
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,890
No.

693
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:57,590
No!

694
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,700
Oh, my God.

695
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,360
No!

696
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:08,600
Oh, my God!

697
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:39,160
Okay.

698
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:12,450
Okay. Come on.

699
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:14,120
Come on.

700
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,260
Maiko?

701
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:23,930
Hello?

702
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,430
No!

703
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:52,820
Hello?

704
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,990
Anybody!

705
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:26,550
Hello?

706
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,550
Help! Somebody!

707
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:31,640
Kyle. Kyle,
we have to get out of here.

708
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,740
What were those pictures?

709
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:35,570
They weren't your mother.
No.

710
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:37,640
I don't understand.
I don't either.

711
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,640
But we have to get out of here,
now.

712
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:42,480
Hey!

713
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,210
They're not gonna help us,
Maiko.

714
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:47,710
God knows where Terry
and Amber are,

715
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:49,480
let alone Skylar
and those idiots.

716
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,750
I have to do
the ceremony tonight,

717
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:53,520
or her soul will be trapped
forever.

718
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,690
Do you hear yourself
right now?

719
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:57,420
It's a myth, Maiko.

720
00:59:57,420 --> 00:59:59,860
We gotta get out
of this forest.

721
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:12,400
I see a way out of here.

722
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:50,840
Kyle, that's Jin!

723
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:56,910
- Kyle!
- Somebody help us, please!

724
01:00:56,910 --> 01:00:58,710
- Hey!
- Help!

725
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:00,810
You gotta help us,
please! Please!

726
01:01:00,810 --> 01:01:02,710
Come on, let us out!

727
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:04,280
Please,
you gotta get us out of here!

728
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,880
What?

729
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:11,150
You can't leave us in here,
please!

730
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,320
You stay.
No.

731
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:29,630
Here!

732
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,800
Grab his hand!
I'm trying!

733
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:38,340
Come on!
Stop!

734
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:47,580
No!

735
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:52,310
Oh, my God.

736
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:54,850
You see anything?

737
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:59,620
- Yeah, trees.
- Lots of frigging trees.

738
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:01,690
I'm serious.

739
01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:04,560
Well, don't you think
I'd tell you if I did?

740
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:09,660
You know, it's not possible
to just lose everyone like this.

741
01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:13,230
What did he say?

742
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:16,500
Sometimes the forest loses you?
Maybe this is what he meant.

743
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,660
Yeah, what who meant?

744
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:19,200
Me.

745
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:24,470
Hey, Terry.
I found your guy.

746
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:28,740
You know what's going on here,
don't you?

747
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:30,510
Terry!

748
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:32,770
<i> Terry!</i>

749
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:35,410
Craig?

750
01:02:35,410 --> 01:02:37,080
What did you say, man?

751
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:39,950
Huh?

752
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:44,580
I said, you know what's
going on here, don't you?

753
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:47,420
This forest, man.

754
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:50,420
It's messing with us, right?

755
01:02:58,930 --> 01:03:00,530
Craig!

756
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:09,100
I told you
to respect the dead.

757
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:11,000
But you didn't listen.

758
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:17,540
I said the Yurei
have a strong draw

759
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:21,610
to people looking for a way
out of this world.

760
01:03:25,150 --> 01:03:26,920
They are in the trees

761
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:32,120
the ground

762
01:03:34,990 --> 01:03:37,160
the air.

763
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:54,140
You stole my watch.

764
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:58,070
Now I steal your soul.

765
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:11,750
<i> Come, join me.</i>

766
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:16,120
<i> Join me, soul.</i>

767
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:57,060
Craig!

768
01:04:57,060 --> 01:05:00,000
Somebody help me!

769
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:07,770
Why is this happening to me?

770
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,030
God.

771
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:49,740
Please, no.

772
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:57,810
Just leave me alone.

773
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:01,780
Oh, my God.

774
01:06:37,450 --> 01:06:40,720
Amber!
Terry!

775
01:06:48,990 --> 01:06:52,560
Can you give that to me?
Yeah, I think so.

776
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:02,900
Got it?

777
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:04,640
Come on.

778
01:07:10,010 --> 01:07:12,610
Ugh, let's go.

779
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:18,180
What happened to him?
I don't know.

780
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:20,650
That was Jin.
How could that have happened?

781
01:07:20,650 --> 01:07:23,690
After what happened, all
I care about is getting us out.

782
01:07:23,690 --> 01:07:24,920
Did Jin just die?

783
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:26,520
That corpse has been dead
for weeks,

784
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,520
maybe longer. Can we go?

785
01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:31,490
We were just with him.
We don't have time for this.

786
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:32,930
Grab my stuff,
I'm not leaving without it.

787
01:07:32,930 --> 01:07:34,830
Okay.

788
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,000
I got them, come on.
Oh, my God.

789
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,470
They track the dead.
What?

790
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:48,700
They track each body
before clearing.

791
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:49,840
They know where they died.

792
01:07:51,010 --> 01:07:52,540
Maiko, come on.

793
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:55,040
For the ceremony,
I can find her.

794
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:56,840
Hurry up then,
come on, come on.

795
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:01,980
That's her,
that's my mother.

796
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:03,950
Okay. Okay, okay, let's go.
Come on.

797
01:08:05,550 --> 01:08:07,020
Let's go.

798
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:15,590
One, two, three.

799
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:20,830
Got you.

800
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:23,060
Oh, God.

801
01:08:23,070 --> 01:08:24,200
Where are the others?

802
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:27,070
I don't know.
I just lost Craig.

803
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:31,570
I mean, one minute, he's right
there. And I mean right there

804
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:33,770
and the next,
I can't find him.

805
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:36,140
I can't hear him. Like Brody.
Like everyone else.

806
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:37,440
Oh, God.

807
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:40,480
I don't even know
how I found you.

808
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:42,080
We're never gonna make it
out of here.

809
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,120
Don't say that.

810
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,420
We have to find everyone
else.

811
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:49,490
People don't just disappear
into thin air.

812
01:08:49,490 --> 01:08:51,390
We need to stay positive.
Okay.

813
01:08:51,390 --> 01:08:54,560
We're gonna find everyone,
and we're gonna get out of here.

814
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,160
Okay?
Okay, okay.

815
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:58,660
Okay.
All right, let's go.

816
01:08:58,660 --> 01:08:59,930
Okay.

817
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:02,600
Maiko, give me the map, okay?

818
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,160
No!

819
01:09:05,530 --> 01:09:07,430
We gotta get out of here,
right now.

820
01:09:07,430 --> 01:09:11,570
Kyle, this isn't make-believe,
or some sort of folklore.

821
01:09:11,570 --> 01:09:13,140
These Yurei are real.

822
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:14,910
The spirits are real,

823
01:09:14,910 --> 01:09:16,140
and my mother wanted
no part of that.

824
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:18,240
That's why she sent me this.
She knew.

825
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:19,810
She knew what?

826
01:09:19,810 --> 01:09:22,110
You heard the officer.
Saw pictures.

827
01:09:22,110 --> 01:09:23,410
Those are not your mother's.

828
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:24,780
Then why did she send them
to me?

829
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:26,780
I don't know. You tell me.

830
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:31,080
There.

831
01:09:31,090 --> 01:09:32,690
That's where she was.
If we get there,

832
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:33,950
I can do
what I came here to do.

833
01:09:33,950 --> 01:09:35,720
This map is gonna get us
out of here.

834
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:38,260
Listen!
No, you listen to me, Maiko!

835
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:40,720
I don't know you well,
but I do know this:

836
01:09:40,730 --> 01:09:43,390
You have a mother and father
in San Francisco

837
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:47,160
now that are safe and sound.
They want to see you again.

838
01:09:47,170 --> 01:09:51,970
Your birth mother is dead.
I'm sorry.

839
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:53,840
The items in this box
are not your mother's,

840
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,340
they're stolen.

841
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:58,870
Just like that watch
that Skylar took.

842
01:09:58,870 --> 01:10:01,810
Now, our friends are missing.

843
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:04,310
There are things going on
that I can't explain,

844
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:05,810
so we're gonna find them

845
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:08,250
and we'll get out of here
before anyone else gets hurt,

846
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:10,210
or worse happens.

847
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:11,680
Okay?

848
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:19,360
Okay.

849
01:10:21,490 --> 01:10:22,990
Okay.

850
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:28,200
Come on. Let's go.

851
01:10:35,370 --> 01:10:37,940
- Okay, here we go.
- Okay, okay.

852
01:10:41,710 --> 01:10:43,040
This isn't the way.

853
01:10:44,610 --> 01:10:47,340
Well,
what the hell do you suggest?

854
01:10:49,410 --> 01:10:52,780
Terry, Terry, I need a break.
Hey. Come on, you can do this.

855
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:55,380
Terry, please, I need a break.
I need a break.

856
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:03,020
I got you.

857
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:06,060
Oh, God.

858
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:13,430
We're lost.
This is ridiculous.

859
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:16,170
We're just going further in.

860
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:18,200
I say we build a fire.

861
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,400
It's only gonna get colder,

862
01:11:20,410 --> 01:11:21,900
and the smoke
and light might help.

863
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:24,540
It might help guide the others.
I'm not gonna stay.

864
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:27,270
What do you wanna do?

865
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:29,540
Build a fire
and roast marshmallows?

866
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:34,910
Do you hear that?

867
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:38,420
Do you?

868
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:46,620
Oh, God, why won't it stop?

869
01:11:48,690 --> 01:11:50,760
What do you want from us?

870
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:56,260
What do you want?

871
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:00,500
Hey, Terry, Terry,
come on, let's go.

872
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:05,170
What is that?

873
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:16,540
It's coming from over there.

874
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:19,180
Hurry!

875
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:25,450
Okay. Okay. Move! Move!

876
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,350
I got you.

877
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:31,050
Oh, wait.

878
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:35,860
I got you,
I got you, keep going.

879
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:37,120
That's them.

880
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,660
Come on, come on. Keep it up,
come on.

881
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:40,590
This way, come on.

882
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:45,930
It's okay.

883
01:12:45,930 --> 01:12:48,000
Amber!
Terry!

884
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,330
You got it.

885
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:55,240
You got it, you got it.

886
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:57,770
Amber!
Maiko!

887
01:12:59,470 --> 01:13:02,240
Hey, guys, we're over here!

888
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:05,040
- Terry!
- Maiko!

889
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,980
- We're coming!
- Amber!

890
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:08,910
Maiko!

891
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:10,880
Hey.

892
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:13,020
Amber! Amber!

893
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:15,720
Hey. Hey, you all right?

894
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:17,420
Amber, you all right?

895
01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:19,550
Your leg.
It's not good.

896
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:22,060
Did you find any of the guys?
No.

897
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:24,520
This forest is playing
tricks on us.

898
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:28,290
I saw this little girl. I mean,
she was calling for her<i> okaasan.</i>

899
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:31,360
What little girl?
I don't know. She wasn't real.

900
01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:33,970
You said she was calling
for her<i> okaasan?</i>

901
01:13:33,970 --> 01:13:35,470
Yeah.

902
01:13:35,470 --> 01:13:38,540
But<i> okaasan</i> means mother.

903
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:42,170
That's--
That's from my dreams.

904
01:13:42,170 --> 01:13:43,970
What are you talking about?
What does that mean?

905
01:13:43,970 --> 01:13:47,740
In my dreams,
there's this little girl...

906
01:13:47,740 --> 01:13:49,840
We gotta get out of here.
Can you walk?

907
01:13:49,850 --> 01:13:51,910
I don't know, I'm--

908
01:14:24,110 --> 01:14:25,610
Oh, my God!

909
01:14:27,210 --> 01:14:29,850
Come on! Come on, come on!

910
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:36,080
I told you

911
01:14:36,090 --> 01:14:38,520
you should not be here.

912
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:42,990
Go, go, go!

913
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:53,660
We're running in circles here.

914
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:56,600
Come on.

915
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:01,670
This is it.

916
01:15:03,870 --> 01:15:05,340
What?

917
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:07,970
From the picture. This--

918
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:10,210
This is where my mother
took her life.

919
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:12,140
She wanted me here.
She...

920
01:15:45,210 --> 01:15:47,040
<i> Okaasan.</i>

921
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:02,320
What?

922
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,130
No.

923
01:16:09,130 --> 01:16:11,000
I had a sister.

924
01:16:26,610 --> 01:16:29,080
Maiko, I'm gonna get you!

925
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:32,810
I want to stay with them!

926
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:37,420
I won't leave them!

927
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:38,690
I want to stay!

928
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:41,650
Let me go!

929
01:16:41,660 --> 01:16:45,720
I want to stay with them...
forever!

930
01:16:45,730 --> 01:16:48,130
Maiko!

931
01:16:49,730 --> 01:16:51,500
Stay here, Maiko.

932
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:10,350
Run, Maiko! Run!

933
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:18,620
No, Mother! No!

934
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:20,450
No.

935
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:21,720
You killed her.

936
01:17:23,690 --> 01:17:25,290
Maiko!
Maiko!

937
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:42,510
Maiko.

938
01:18:01,530 --> 01:18:06,490
Amber! Amber! Amber!

939
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,900
Amber! Amber!

940
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:39,960
Amber!

941
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:58,310
Let's go!
She's the way out!

942
01:18:58,310 --> 01:19:01,040
She knows the way out!

943
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:02,310
Hurry!

944
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:10,780
Where did she go?

945
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:13,820
Wait, this is different!

946
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:17,050
That's it.

947
01:19:19,190 --> 01:19:20,690
Kyle!

948
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:24,590
No! No!

949
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:28,730
Help! Kyle!

950
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:31,100
Maiko!

951
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:40,340
No!

952
01:19:43,010 --> 01:19:44,810
No!

953
01:19:44,810 --> 01:19:46,940
Kyle!

954
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:49,280
Please, leave him alone!

955
01:19:51,350 --> 01:19:52,780
No!

956
01:19:54,620 --> 01:19:56,180
Leave him alone!

957
01:19:58,780 --> 01:20:02,820
No! No!

958
01:20:04,290 --> 01:20:05,350
Oh, my God!

959
01:20:07,390 --> 01:20:09,320
No!

960
01:20:09,330 --> 01:20:11,130
No!

961
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:13,930
Kyle!

962
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:20,300
No! No!

963
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:21,800
Please!

964
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,540
Leave him alone!

965
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:27,270
Kyle! No!

966
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:32,940
No! Oh, my God! Kyle!

967
01:20:35,380 --> 01:20:37,980
Oh, my God!

968
01:20:39,610 --> 01:20:41,010
No!

969
01:20:41,010 --> 01:20:42,780
Oh, my God.

970
01:21:06,340 --> 01:21:08,040
No!

971
01:21:15,010 --> 01:21:17,410
No!

972
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:55,890
We're going the wrong way.

973
01:24:55,890 --> 01:25:00,030
We're going the wrong way!
We're going the wrong way!

974
01:25:00,030 --> 01:25:03,000
Sometimes you get lost
in the forest.

975
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,530
Sometimes the forest loses you.

976
01:25:05,530 --> 01:25:06,760
No!

977
01:25:07,670 --> 01:25:10,870
Please, no!

978
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:14,570
No!

979
01:25:14,570 --> 01:25:16,640
Please! No!

980
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:18,840
No!

981
