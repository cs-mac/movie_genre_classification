1
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:11,839
In His infinite wisdom, the Lord has seen fit

2
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:15,426
to take from us a just and courageous friend.

3
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:18,429
That Simon Cordier in the prime of his manhood

4
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:20,431
should have come to his death as he did,

5
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,893
makes his passing even a greater shock

6
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:27,271
to those he has left behind.

7
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:31,150
As one of France's most respected magistrates,

8
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:35,822
Simon Cordier dedicated his life to the betterment of humanity.

9
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:41,702
All that Simon Cordier was can be summed up in these words:

10
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,871
He was a good man.

11
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,707
May God have mercy on his soul.

12
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:00,513
Make him Eternal...

13
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:48,936
All those fine words. I'm glad he's dead.

14
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,191
Mr. D'Arville, Miss Jeanne.

15
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,860
It was Magistrate Cordier's wish before he died

16
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,779
that we all assemble after the funeral.

17
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,783
My daughter and I are willing to respect the wishes of the dead.

18
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,453
More so than if he were living.

19
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:08,372
We will see you at the gallery, then.

20
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,499
Yes.

21
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,265
Why Magistrate Cordier should have entrusted this task

22
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,393
to my daughter and to me, I do not know.

23
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:32,480
Our feelings toward him are no secret.

24
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:39,028
As Father Borman knows, this chest and the letter

25
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:42,073
were given to my daughter by Magistrate Cordier

26
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,617
the night he died.

27
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:48,663
The letter written by the Magistrate says that if he died that night,

28
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,792
then, this chest must not be opened until immediately after the funeral.

29
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,419
But why would he think he might die?

30
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,879
Surely, it was an accident.

31
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,047
Father Borman,

32
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:01,050
my investigation proved that it was not suicide.

33
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,636
The letter requested that we be present

34
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,346
when the chest is opened,

35
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:08,349
since it involved matters important to all of you.

36
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:11,602
The chest, Mr. D'Arville, please.

37
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,738
A book?

38
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,118
It seems to be a personal diary.

39
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,495
And a note.

40
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,874
"'I speak to you from the grave."

41
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:40,506
"In the sanctuary of my coffin, I can state certain facts

42
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,842
which I could not do while I was alive.

43
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,345
If I had attempted to do so before my death,

44
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:49,265
I would have been judged insane,

45
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:52,518
and my warning to mankind would have gone unheeded."'

46
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,812
Warning?

47
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,355
What do you know about this?

48
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,190
Nothing, I swear it, Captain.

49
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,651
I did not know the Magistrate even kept a diary.

50
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:01,902
That is the truth.

51
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:06,991
"Do not regard with cynicism what you learn now.

52
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:09,702
Once you have heard the contents of my diary,

53
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,496
the future will be in your hands.

54
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:17,418
God be with you, for you will need His help."

55
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:23,799
Perhaps that is why the Magistrate wanted you to be here.

56
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,761
Please, Mr. D'Arville, the diary.

57
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:37,188
September 17, 1886.

58
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:41,817
The strange events which occasion me to begin this diary

59
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:46,405
started three days before the murderer Louis Girot

60
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,616
was to go to the guillotine.

61
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:53,412
And police captain Rennedon came to my chambers at the tribune.

62
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:56,957
Oh, Captain.

63
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,584
Is Magistrate Cordier busy?

64
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,920
He's just come from the court.

65
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,590
Come in.

66
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,175
Captain Rennedon, sir.

67
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,594
Oh, tell him to come in.

68
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,932
-Well, Robert. -Simon.

69
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,392
This is a pleasure,

70
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,894
unless, of course, you've brought me trouble.

71
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,396
I don't think I have,

72
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:21,399
considering your endless studies of the criminal mind,

73
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,068
which I'll never understand.

74
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:27,238
It concerns Louis Girot. He wants to talk to you.

75
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,574
Oh, does he want to change the testimony he gave at the trial?

76
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,243
A strange fish, Girot.

77
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,870
It's hard to tell what he wants.

78
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,707
Well, he goes to the guillotine in three days.

79
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:39,917
Perhaps it's his conscience.

80
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,836
A confession?

81
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,171
Maybe. It is possible.

82
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,802
As you say, he is a strange fish.

83
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:54,014
Girot murdered four people, without motivation.

84
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:57,059
He didn't know any of them. He didn't rob them.

85
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,728
He just killed.

86
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:03,607
Yes, the case is most perplexing.

87
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:06,193
Which means that you're curious enough to see him.

88
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:09,864
To me, a thief is a thief, a murderer is a murderer.

89
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,116
Life is much simpler that way.

90
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,494
-Shall we go? -Yes.

91
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,127
There we are.

92
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:31,760
I'd better go in with you.

93
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,638
No, he might talk more if we were alone.

94
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:37,850
All right, I'll wait here. Guard.

95
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:57,161
Magistrate Cordier, thank you for coming.

96
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,082
It's the only hospitality I can offer you.

97
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,296
Captain Rennedon believed

98
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:10,299
you might be ready to make a statement, Girot.

99
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:13,802
A statement? Perhaps.

100
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,931
But what is it you want me to say?

101
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,183
Something I did not say at the trial?

102
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:21,519
If there is truth in it.

103
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,397
Can't you understand, Magistrate?

104
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:29,235
I told the truth at the trial.

105
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,653
I swear to you.

106
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:34,740
It was something that... that used me.

107
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:39,245
Just as if it took my body and made me murder.

108
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:43,707
Please, Girot, you seem to be a man of some intelligence.

109
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:52,174
And in three days, my intelligence will be chopped off at the neck.

110
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:57,388
Do you think that I would go on lying,

111
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,056
knowing that I'm going to die?

112
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:03,185
But a man doesn't kill four people without reason.

113
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:07,189
It was a thing that possessed me that had the reason.

114
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:11,527
It lives on evil and grows stronger and stronger.

115
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:13,862
Please, Girot, sit down.

116
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:18,200
I didn't even know until afterward that I had killed.

117
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,912
It had control of my mind. I had no will of my own.

118
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,206
It forced me to murder.

119
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,001
I couldn't accept this testimony before.

120
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,128
Do you expect me to believe it now?

121
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:34,383
I had never thought that hatred is evil.

122
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:37,636
-Hatred is evil. -But that's in you.

123
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:42,391
And it used that to feed on my will until it owned me.

124
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:46,145
Girot, I'm sorry, I had hoped you'd be able to give me some...

125
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:50,357
But do you know why I never asked for a new trial?

126
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,613
I want to die.

127
00:10:55,822 --> 00:11:03,412
Because so long as I live, the thing can make me kill again.

128
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:09,960
Girot, what is it? Your eyes...

129
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:13,339
It can even make me...

130
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:17,343
...kill you!

131
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,345
Girot!

132
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,225
Guard!

133
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:37,446
He tried to kill me.

134
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:41,241
I warned you, murderers, they're all the same.

135
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,244
Humanity would be much better off without them.

136
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,581
Call the doctor, hurry!

137
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:51,543
Is he badly hurt?

138
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:59,301
There'll be no need to chop in the guillotine.

139
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,136
Dead?

140
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,472
But it was so sudden.

141
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:07,643
One moment he was completely rational, and then...

142
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:11,230
This is terrible, Robert, I...

143
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,357
If anything, I wanted to help him.

144
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:16,110
You had to defend yourself. It was an accident.

145
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:19,988
Besides, I'd say you did help him.

146
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:23,409
This is a much easier way to die.

147
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,500
For the next two days,

148
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,544
I returned home from my work at the court

149
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:37,506
with the death of the murderer Girot still on my mind.

150
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:40,050
Despite Rennedon's assurance of my innocence,

151
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:43,178
somehow the accident still disturbed me,

152
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,889
and I could not rid myself of the depression

153
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:48,559
that weighed so heavily.

154
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,317
-Good evening, sir. -Good morning, Pierre.

155
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,905
Sir, I'll tell you Louise's secret.

156
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:04,616
She's preparing your favorite dinner, baked lamb!

157
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:10,122
Oh, that's fine, but I... I think I need a cognac before.

158
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,875
-In the study, please. -Yes, sir.

159
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:34,855
Well, Kiki, you're in fine voice.

160
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,608
You must have been practicing all day.

161
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,444
And just because you've been so industrious,

162
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:44,531
you, too, are going to have a special dinner.

163
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,035
There you are.

164
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,513
Pierre!

165
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:13,101
Sir.

166
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,103
Why did you put this back in here?

167
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:18,899
I...? But I haven't even seen it since you...

168
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,484
Would I do such a thing?

169
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:23,529
But it was hanging there on the wall, Pierre.

170
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,571
Who's been in the house?

171
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,157
Only Louise and myself.

172
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,254
Pierre, what is it? What has happened?

173
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:43,382
I... I'm not sure.

174
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:47,511
You remember the large photograph of Mrs. Cordier and the boy?

175
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,222
Oh, the one that used to be in the study?

176
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,891
It was back there tonight.

177
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,268
But how could that be?

178
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,396
It was put away in that trunk with the other things.

179
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,314
Yes.

180
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,564
"Hatred is Evil."

181
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:27,194
Those were Girot's words.

182
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,155
Sir?

183
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,451
Pierre.

184
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:37,120
Somebody must have been up here.

185
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,456
First, the picture, and then...

186
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:41,375
then the writing on the pedestal.

187
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,626
Writing?

188
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:45,212
Yes, in the dust there.

189
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,262
It was there!

190
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,390
Perhaps it's just the light. You only thought that...

191
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:59,393
Pierre, I'm not in the habit of seeing things that do not exist.

192
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,478
Of course not, sir.

193
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,563
Why is this happening?

194
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,109
They've been dead so long.

195
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,571
I thought the past was behind me.

196
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:40,183
I put the cognac in the study, sir.

197
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,019
Thank you.

198
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:54,031
-Well? -It's very strange.

199
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,616
He looks so pale. Perhaps he's ill.

200
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,202
I'll see if he'll have dinner.

201
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:14,051
Sir, shall I tell Louise to serve dinner?

202
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:21,016
Pierre, you had ample time to know Mrs. Cordier well before she died.

203
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:22,434
Why, yes, sir.

204
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:25,604
You know that both she and the boy meant a great deal to me.

205
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,481
Of course, sir.

206
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:32,819
Perhaps memories are suddenly unlocked in a man's mind.

207
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:36,740
And he has dreams, nightmares.

208
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:38,909
I can only surmise

209
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:43,371
that such memories of my wife and my son have returned.

210
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:49,127
Pierre, after I have gone to sleep at night,

211
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,630
have I ever left my bedroom?

212
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:55,092
I'm not sure I understand, sir.

213
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:59,387
But I mean sleepwalked, wandered in my sleep

214
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,557
because of a dream, a nightmare...

215
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:06,353
I don't know, sir. Our room is in the other wing.

216
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,732
I must have.

217
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,444
There has to be a logical explanation.

218
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,783
Tell Louise that I'll have my dinner shortly.

219
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:21,743
Yes, sir.

220
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:27,749
My wife and son have been dead for 12 years.

221
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:31,294
Why should these strange things be happening,

222
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:35,257
now, only since the death of Louis Girot?

223
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:45,183
-Good morning, Martin. -Good morning, sir.

224
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,310
Would you bring me the Costane brief, please?

225
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:49,354
-Yes, sir. -Thank you.

226
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,428
-The Costane brief, sir. -Thank you.

227
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:24,639
Did you have any reason for leaving this here?

228
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,185
"Trial testimony of Louis Girot..."'

229
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:33,857
The prisoner who... who died the other day?

230
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,526
No, sir, I didn't take it out of the file.

231
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,028
It was on my desk.

232
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,863
The office was locked.

233
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:44,201
Could you have put it there before you left last night?

234
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:47,204
Yes.

235
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,497
Yes, that's possible.

236
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,459
Perhaps I was so upset by what happened,

237
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:55,462
I didn't remember.

238
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,423
Yes, sir, it must have been most unnerving.

239
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,884
Yes, that will be all, Martin. Thank you.

240
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:35,627
Martin, will you find the superintendent of the building?

241
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:39,005
I want you to ask him if anyone of the cleaning people

242
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:42,509
could have taken the Girot testimony from the file.

243
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:45,387
-Immediately, sir. -Thank you.

244
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,595
Is someone here?

245
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:47,115
Magistrate Cordier.

246
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:49,743
Since Louis Girot is dead,

247
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,038
you have no further use for his papers.

248
00:22:53,831 --> 00:23:00,003
You deprived me of Girot's body, his mind, his will.

249
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:03,590
Now I will have yours.

250
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:09,095
What's the matter with me?

251
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:12,682
Can I be as sick as Girot?

252
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:31,368
I was determined to take my place on the bench that day,

253
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:34,954
despite the fears I had for my sanity.

254
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:38,041
But suddenly, I felt I couldn't go on.

255
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:40,752
It was impossible for me to concentrate.

256
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,631
I hadn't even heard the arguments of the attorneys.

257
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:49,386
I knew I would have to call a recess and leave for the day.

258
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:07,779
Very interesting, Magistrate.

259
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:13,243
I've been waiting patiently to see what you would write.

260
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:19,040
You still think I exist only in your mind.

261
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:25,588
Men's logic has always denied my existence.

262
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,633
Since we have only begun to know each other,

263
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:31,511
perhaps we should come closer to the truth.

264
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:41,187
Rise, Simon Cordier.

265
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:49,154
Life and death are the only truths.

266
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,031
Everything else is illusion.

267
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,160
Yourself...

268
00:24:57,121 --> 00:25:01,833
Your love for a useless bird in a cage.

269
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:08,715
Death is a truth, Magistrate.

270
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,633
Prove it.

271
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:27,984
Prove it now!

272
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:53,051
Kiki, where are you?

273
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:55,303
How did you get out?

274
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:16,699
How does one explain what one cannot see, Dr. Borman?

275
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:21,788
I hear this voice as though someone is in the room with me.

276
00:26:21,956 --> 00:26:24,874
But I am alone. No one else is there.

277
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:28,753
And it was this voice that urged you to kill your pet?

278
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,756
Well, how else can I explain it?

279
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:35,093
The photograph, the writing in the dust,

280
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:37,887
the trial testimony on your desk,

281
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:41,391
the overturned inkwell, and the voice...

282
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,185
Do you feel they are all related?

283
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:47,397
Somehow, yes, yes.

284
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,865
It is you who relate them,

285
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,618
for they are all from your own imagination.

286
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:06,124
Science does not accept gnomes, ghosts, demons, images of evil.

287
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:08,418
The things you've told me

288
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,796
about the tragic death of your wife and son,

289
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:14,382
the abnormal loneliness you've lived in for the past 12 years...

290
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:16,676
No, thank you.

291
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:21,681
A man can torture himself just so long that it must end,

292
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,142
or the mind will break under the strain.

293
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,769
I'm not sure what you mean.

294
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:29,230
-You want my help. -Yes.

295
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:30,898
Will you do as I say?

296
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,610
Now, Doctor, if there's hope, I'll do anything.

297
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,321
A doctor always has hope.

298
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:41,451
Hope of curing his patient, hope that his bill will be paid.

299
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,328
Of course there's hope.

300
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,080
Then, I've come to the right man.

301
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:50,209
I've never had reason before to go to an alienist.

302
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:54,255
However, I can't cure you.

303
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,841
-You have to cure yourself. -Oh?

304
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,926
You have to change your life.

305
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,178
Get out of yourself.

306
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:03,306
Never submit to loneliness.

307
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:05,099
You said you used to sculpt?

308
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:09,187
In my younger days, I was quite interested in art.

309
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:12,607
Fine. Become interested again.

310
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:15,360
Get away from this existence you've been leading.

311
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:17,695
Associate with people in the art world.

312
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:21,240
Find something to sculpt and start sculpting.

313
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,825
Take a vacation from your work.

314
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:26,037
Doctor, I have so many cases at court, I...

315
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,539
I can only give you the prescription.

316
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,626
The medicine, you must take yourself.

317
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:37,298
Well, thank you. Talking to you has been most reassuring.

318
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:39,133
I can't tell you how relieved I am.

319
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,968
Then, I've served my purpose.

320
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,929
Let me hear from you again in a few weeks.

321
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:45,765
-Good-bye. -Good-bye, Doctor.

322
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,718
Red wine! Red wine!

323
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,011
How emotional, sensual, huh?

324
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,722
Nudes that like nudes!

325
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,099
You know what's the matter with you? You're a woman!

326
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,559
And you know what's the matter with you?

327
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,768
You're a pig!

328
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,229
I'm a pig? I'm a pig? - You're a pig!

329
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:35,148
Who taught you all you know about...?

330
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:59,005
Why don't you buy me, sir?

331
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:04,343
It will be an act of charity. The artist could use the money.

332
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,304
You're the model, aren't you?

333
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:09,766
Would you believe that I know nothing at all about ballet?

334
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:13,895
No. Well, then, either you have the natural grace of a dancer

335
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,397
or the artist gave it to you.

336
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:18,191
You are an artist?

337
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,610
Well I... I like to sculpt.

338
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:24,947
Oh, sculptors are always covered with clay and stone dust and...

339
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:26,741
and have no money.

340
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,285
Perhaps amateurs are more fortunate.

341
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:34,999
Oh? Then, perhaps, you have enough money for me to pose for you.

342
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,378
Do I not inspire you?

343
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,006
Yes, I think so.

344
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,258
Let me see.

345
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,094
A Greek goddess perhaps.

346
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,263
Oh, so serious.

347
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:50,765
Of course.

348
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:53,976
-Why not Heinrich Heine, then? -Who?

349
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:56,562
Heine. He once wrote a wonderful poem.

350
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,606
It was called "'Woman"'.

351
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:01,943
Oh, I didn't think any man knew women.

352
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,613
Each of the four stanzas is about a different situation

353
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,865
going from gaiety to tragedy,

354
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:11,661
and yet, each of the stanzas ends with the same words:

355
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:13,830
"And she laughed."

356
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:19,126
"Cause I think you would always laugh.

357
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:22,046
And that is the way you would like to sculpt me?

358
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:24,507
As a girl who can laugh at life?

359
00:31:24,842 --> 00:31:26,676
Yes.

360
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,928
Good. For your laughing woman,

361
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:31,931
I shall charge you 10 francs an hour to pose.

362
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:33,683
Agreed.

363
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,018
You're not going to haggle over the price?

364
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:38,354
No, it's very reasonable.

365
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:40,481
Here's my address.

366
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:42,650
I'll expect you this evening at 8:00

367
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,945
so we can begin the preliminary sketches.

368
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:50,199
My name is Odette Mallotte. I shall be there.

369
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:54,495
-Good-bye, Odette. -Good-bye.

370
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:59,750
Simon Cordier.

371
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,712
Magistrate...

372
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:17,435
Good afternoon.

373
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:19,228
-Oh, Odette. -Jeanne.

374
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:20,688
How are you, Odette?

375
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:23,566
I've seen bigger crowds than this.

376
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:25,276
There are always more customers at night.

377
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:28,279
Well, let's hope they show more enthusiasm than these.

378
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:31,240
It doesn't matter. I have faith in Paul's work.

379
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:33,993
After all, Odette, it is Paul's first show.

380
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:37,163
It takes time for an artist to become popular.

381
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:39,165
Of course, Jeanne.

382
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:43,377
We all have Paul's interests at heart, don't we?

383
00:32:45,923 --> 00:32:48,299
He's in the office having coffee.

384
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:06,651
Oh, hello, darling.

385
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:09,445
I thought there would be more customers by the time you got here.

386
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:12,782
Six rich ones are better than twenty poor ones.

387
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,326
-Anybody buy? -Yeah, the small seascape.

388
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,370
The one where I posed on the rock?

389
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,372
30 francs.

390
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,499
30 francs?

391
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,000
Oh, Paul.

392
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,419
Paint, canvas, a frame?

393
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:28,130
Your time and my time for 30 francs?

394
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,924
Well, the larger ones will bring more.

395
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:33,719
Oh, what is Andre doing, trying to sell them by the yard?

396
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,514
Well, at least I'm going to make some money.

397
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:40,101
-You? -I have a job, posing.

398
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:44,105
When you married me, you said you'd give up posing for anyone else.

399
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,816
I didn't say I'd give up eating.

400
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:53,572
Well, at least we starve together.

401
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,367
Odette, you know how much I love you.

402
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:58,577
Oh, love!

403
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:02,123
Love! A man says the word so easily!

404
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,958
Do I have to wait until you're an old man

405
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:08,254
before I can get a new dress, until I can feel like a woman again?

406
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:11,549
Have I ever failed to make you feel like a woman?

407
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:15,845
10 francs an hour.

408
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,555
We need the money, Paul.

409
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:20,516
Who is this artist who can afford so much money?

410
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:24,562
You're jealous? Yeah, my husband?

411
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:25,563
Yes.

412
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:28,190
You worry too much.

413
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:31,819
What man could know me better than you?

414
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:33,529
There, for luck.

415
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:35,281
Sell a lot of paintings,

416
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:40,161
and we'll share a bottle of wine when I return, all right?

417
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:05,728
-Mrs. Mallotte? -Yes.

418
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:07,438
Come in, please.

419
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:16,030
I'll tell Magistrate Cordier that you are here. Please.

420
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:35,049
8:00 exactly. You are most prompt.

421
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:37,551
Oh, well, the time of a magistrate is important.

422
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:39,178
And is your time not important?

423
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:42,515
Oh, the more I look at clocks, the more they keep saying,

424
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:46,602
"Here it is tomorrow already, and you're a day older."

425
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:50,523
Only at my age is each day so valuable.

426
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,274
Where do you work?

427
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:55,569
The studio is upstairs. Come.

428
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:12,253
When he brought home the clay and said to clean up the attic,

429
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,338
I knew everything was going to be all right.

430
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:17,091
-She's beautiful. -Yes.

431
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:18,425
It's been a long time

432
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:21,470
since we've seen a woman go up those stairs.

433
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,818
Oh, how nice!

434
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:40,406
It'll be a pleasure to pose for once in a studio that isn't drafty.

435
00:36:40,574 --> 00:36:42,992
Most artists can't even afford heat.

436
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:46,662
Well, the house is quite old but very well built.

437
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,957
I think my ancestors demanded their comfort.

438
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,542
Are those were the ones who frowned at me

439
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,710
in the hall downstairs?

440
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,587
The portraits?

441
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:58,716
I assure you, they frown at everyone.

442
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:02,553
Is your laughing lady to laugh with or without her clothes on?

443
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:03,971
No, it won't be a nude.

444
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:07,808
Oh, that's right.

445
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:12,605
There should be nothing to detract from the expression on her face.

446
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:16,525
You know quite a good deal about art, don't you?

447
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:20,738
One listens, one learns.

448
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:21,947
Where shall I pose?

449
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:25,367
Oh, I'm sorry, right here. The light is best here.

450
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:26,994
All right.

451
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:35,294
Let's see.

452
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:39,840
You want the head, throat, and bare shoulders.

453
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:41,842
Yes.

454
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:52,228
I'm afraid I've forgotten

455
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,188
how to compliment a beautiful woman.

456
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:58,484
I hope perhaps the clay will be able to do it for me.

457
00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:07,326
There. Down a little.

458
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:16,877
Now, the expression, Odette. The expression. Gaiety.

459
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:18,462
Think of something to laugh about.

460
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:22,925
Oh, that's simple. Life is full of things to laugh at.

461
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,681
There!

462
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:32,351
There, that's it. That's the expression.

463
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:35,020
Now, keep it just like that.

464
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,694
The sketches are finished,

465
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:45,114
and I have begun the actual working of the clay.

466
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:47,825
My eagerness to capture Odette's laughing quality,

467
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:50,661
which is gay yet strangely enigmatic,

468
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:54,123
has found me sculpting for long hours without realizing it.

469
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:58,085
But the girl has held the difficult pose without complaining.

470
00:38:58,295 --> 00:38:59,503
It is indeed flattering

471
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:02,298
that she shares my dedication to the work.

472
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:07,386
The nightmares have not returned, and I feel so much better now.

473
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:10,472
It is as if all the dark corners of my mind

474
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,559
have been filled with bright sunlight.

475
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:17,104
There! We've done it.

476
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:19,940
We've brought highness point to life.

477
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,692
You are the laughing woman.

478
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:26,363
Why not? Heine was writing about me all the time.

479
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:32,369
It's good! It's really good!

480
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:34,455
I am now immortal.

481
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,457
You have created me.

482
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,376
You are my master, and I thank you.

483
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:42,546
You really like it? I hoped you would.

484
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:43,714
But what happens to me now?

485
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:47,009
Do I stay up here like all the rest of your statues to gather dust?

486
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:49,636
No, that wouldn't give her much to laugh about, would it?

487
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,514
Perhaps you should do something new

488
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:54,808
to keep her company.

489
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:56,435
Oh, what would you like?

490
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:58,729
Oh, I don't know.

491
00:39:59,189 --> 00:40:02,524
Oh, of course. A life-size figure of me.

492
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:03,776
Then, she could look at herself,

493
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:06,111
and you would know why she's laughing.

494
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:09,782
You don't take yourself seriously at all, do you?

495
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,742
Now you've returned to being the magistrate

496
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,203
who wants to know about people.

497
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:16,914
Why should you want to know about me?

498
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:20,959
I've posed, the work is finished.

499
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:23,462
I will leave.

500
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:29,468
Sometime I might just do that life-sized figure of you.

501
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:33,472
Tonight you think that. Tomorrow...

502
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,141
You know what I am?

503
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:38,644
Perfume.

504
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:41,438
Your 10 francs an hour bought it.

505
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:45,150
And that is all you will remember of me.

506
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,987
The scent of a perfume that was once in this room.

507
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:51,281
No, really, Odette, I...

508
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:56,453
Sensitive enough to be an artist.

509
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:03,836
Strong enough to be a man who can judge others.

510
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:08,382
You're an unusual man, Simon.

511
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:12,261
That is what I will remember of you.

512
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:16,598
Thank you, Odette. You're very kind.

513
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:21,895
When you told me your wife had died many years ago,

514
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:26,483
I thought, "How fine she looks.

515
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:29,611
She must have meant a great deal to him."

516
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:33,449
And yet, you keep her locked away up here.

517
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,659
I've wondered why.

518
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:38,537
It was the way she died.

519
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:43,083
She wasn't buried from the church.

520
00:41:44,294 --> 00:41:47,087
But surely she must have been a good woman.

521
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:51,133
She took her own life.

522
00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:54,470
And you never forgave her.

523
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,472
I...

524
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:00,350
It was in the past.

525
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:05,063
Perhaps she didn't know how to laugh at herself.

526
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:11,820
Odette, I'm grateful to you in more ways than you know.

527
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:18,327
I think I will miss this attic.

528
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:22,706
If I have another idea for a new work, I'll call on you.

529
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:25,042
Now, the coach is waiting.

530
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:32,216
-Good-bye, Simon. -Good-bye, Odette.

531
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:21,682
What is it, Magistrate?

532
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,934
Are you wondering how so important a man

533
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:27,271
can fail to see himself in a mirror?

534
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:31,817
Now, come, Simon Cordier, you should know by now

535
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:36,029
that I am real, that I am not a dream.

536
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:38,740
Common sense should tell you

537
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:41,034
that the reason you can't see yourself

538
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:44,955
is that someone stands between you and the mirror.

539
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:46,123
What?

540
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:49,001
I am that someone.

541
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:52,421
That should assure you that my physical being is quite solid,

542
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,048
even if your eyes can't see me.

543
00:43:57,677 --> 00:43:59,636
That's not possible.

544
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,931
I do not believe it.

545
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:13,108
You are there!

546
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:16,403
Then, why can't I see you?

547
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:18,572
Calm yourself, Magistrate.

548
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:22,409
I will give you back your reflection.

549
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:28,957
You see, as good as new.

550
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,960
Tell me what's happening.

551
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:34,838
Are you human?

552
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,424
That depends on the point of view.

553
00:44:37,634 --> 00:44:42,137
If you mean, do the Horla live on the earth as you do?

554
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:45,891
Yes, you are not the sole inhabitants.

555
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:48,769
The Horla?

556
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,729
But if you are here...

557
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:55,442
We have always been. We just exist on different planes.

558
00:44:55,652 --> 00:45:00,447
We can move into your plane only when you make it possible.

559
00:45:03,993 --> 00:45:06,662
I don't understand.

560
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:09,623
How could I have made it possible?

561
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:12,459
Through evil, Magistrate.

562
00:45:12,669 --> 00:45:15,796
But I have fought evil all my life.

563
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:18,048
The great Magistrate,

564
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:22,511
the dispenser of justice for one and all.

565
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,971
You're a murderer, Simon Cordier.

566
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:28,558
I have never murdered anyone!

567
00:45:45,118 --> 00:45:47,786
This was your victim, Magistrate.

568
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:50,372
You drove her to suicide.

569
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:53,750
You tortured her mind until she took her own life.

570
00:45:54,711 --> 00:45:55,961
No.

571
00:45:56,129 --> 00:45:59,256
She was innocent, yet you judged her guilty.

572
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:02,426
You blamed her for the death of your son.

573
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:12,769
Forgive me.

574
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:18,400
Now I am here, and I will never leave you.

575
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:20,402
Why? What do you want?

576
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:22,529
Your will, Magistrate.

577
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:25,991
Your evil has delivered you to me.

578
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:30,036
I've paid for my sins.

579
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:33,957
You thought your loneliness was repentance for your wife's death.

580
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:38,879
All it did was make you vulnerable.

581
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:44,176
Look, Magistrate. Look at the clay you finished sculpting tonight.

582
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:48,764
You wanted to believe

583
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:52,309
that your model was what she pretended to be.

584
00:47:06,783 --> 00:47:10,285
But this is what she really is.

585
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:13,371
You see evil in everything!

586
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:16,166
Only where it exists.

587
00:47:16,793 --> 00:47:20,837
No. No, she is as I saw her.

588
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:46,112
Pierre! Pierre, come up here at once.

589
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,907
-What is it? -I don't know.

590
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:02,963
Sir?

591
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,590
Pierre.

592
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:08,677
The clay. Tell me, what do you see?

593
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:12,264
Why, it's changed, sir.

594
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:16,017
Yes. Yes, I wanted you to see.

595
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:18,687
But why, sir? Why is it changed?

596
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:22,107
Thank you, Pierre. That will be all.

597
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:24,526
Leave me alone now, please.

598
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:52,345
All my life I had sought knowledge,

599
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:56,725
and now I was granted knowledge rarely granted other men.

600
00:48:56,934 --> 00:49:01,438
No more hideous fact could have been conceived to terrify my mind.

601
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:04,566
The Horla really live.

602
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:05,901
They cannot be seen.

603
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:09,905
Still, they are tangible, composed of solid matter.

604
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,489
And only the Lord knows

605
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:15,118
if they are flesh and blood as we are.

606
00:49:15,912 --> 00:49:17,996
Why are they here?

607
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:22,500
Why has their evil been turned loose upon the earth?

608
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:33,428
You tremble, Magistrate? Why?

609
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:38,683
Perhaps I will be a gentle and kind master.

610
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:40,769
Get out! Leave me alone!

611
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,729
But I want to help you.

612
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:47,400
There. No reason we shouldn't be comfortable, is there?

613
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:50,654
You do not believe that the woman who posed for you

614
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:52,906
is without a heart,

615
00:49:53,074 --> 00:49:58,328
that your riches, your position, are the goal of her evil ambition.

616
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:02,999
It makes no difference. I'll never see her again.

617
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:06,503
Don't you want to prove that I'm wrong?

618
00:50:06,671 --> 00:50:09,172
The woman means nothing to me.

619
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:11,091
She will.

620
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,261
What are you saying?

621
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:18,139
You will pursue her, Magistrate.

622
00:50:18,307 --> 00:50:22,769
You will seek to create love where there is no love.

623
00:50:22,979 --> 00:50:27,440
No, I will not. I tell you, I will not!

624
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:33,071
Your will obeys me from this moment on.

625
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:35,532
You have no choice.

626
00:50:37,994 --> 00:50:41,663
She is a vain woman, Magistrate.

627
00:50:41,831 --> 00:50:46,126
The painting of her, the one that brought you together,

628
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:50,255
it would appeal to that vanity.

629
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:58,805
I thought I'd never live to see it,

630
00:50:59,015 --> 00:51:01,975
the face of another woman where Mrs. Cordier's had been.

631
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:05,145
There are so many strange things happening in this house.

632
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:11,651
They're coming.

633
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:16,114
And you won't tell me what the surprise is?

634
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:18,033
Well, why spoil it?

635
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,869
Seeing you this soon again was enough of a surprise.

636
00:51:21,037 --> 00:51:23,329
Did you really think I'd let you get away so easily?

637
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:26,708
I thought you were only interested in clay women.

638
00:51:32,048 --> 00:51:34,424
-Good afternoon, sir. -Good afternoon, Pierre.

639
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:39,137
Tell Louise that we'll want her finest dinner, and champagne.

640
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:41,514
-'81 was a good year. -Yes, sir.

641
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:45,351
Champagne? You're filled with surprises.

642
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:50,648
Well, I want this to be a most memorable day.

643
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:54,694
The suspense is positively unbearable.

644
00:51:58,908 --> 00:52:00,742
My painting!

645
00:52:04,914 --> 00:52:10,085
Oh, Simon, why? Why did you buy it?

646
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:13,671
Well, it was such an ugly empty space there.

647
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,507
Well, I think it's quite decorative, don't you?

648
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:17,842
Well, is that the only reason you brought me here,

649
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:19,302
to get my opinion?

650
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,429
Well, can you think of a more charming audience

651
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:23,723
for such a charming painting?

652
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:25,558
I'm overwhelmed.

653
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:28,186
Well, then, perhaps this memorable day will...

654
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:31,856
will lead to many such days.

655
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:34,567
I'm not sure what you mean.

656
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:36,778
Well, it's really quite simple.

657
00:52:36,946 --> 00:52:38,696
You see, after you left here last night,

658
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:44,536
I suddenly realized that both the house and my heart

659
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,788
were quite empty.

660
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:51,584
Oh, and yesterday I thought I'd never see you again.

661
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:54,420
Oh, Simon, you...

662
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:58,341
you gave me no indication that you felt this way.

663
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:00,677
And I realize that I'm much older than you are.

664
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:05,265
Oh, no, please, I'm flattered.

665
00:53:06,142 --> 00:53:07,559
Can't you understand?

666
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:12,313
All those weeks we were together, I was the one who cared.

667
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:15,567
Very well, then, defendant, how to you plead?

668
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:18,153
I don't know whether I'm innocent of guilty feelings

669
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:22,198
or guilty of innocent feelings.

670
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:26,494
Are you wondering if I am proposing marriage?

671
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:30,665
-Marriage? -Would you accept less?

672
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:33,668
Oh, Simon, I...

673
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:36,796
I only know I love you.

674
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:39,132
Then, I will pronounce the sentence.

675
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,968
Turn around, turn around.

676
00:53:54,607 --> 00:53:56,357
Oh, Simon.

677
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:59,152
Oh, Simon, it's lovely.

678
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:04,199
Thank you, Simon.

679
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:09,621
Would it answer your question if I told you that that cameo

680
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,789
once belonged to my wife?

681
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:16,002
Oh, Simon.

682
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:26,346
When she came home last night, she was a stranger to me,

683
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:28,556
as though I had never known her.

684
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:30,183
Nothing I said made any difference.

685
00:54:30,351 --> 00:54:32,644
She just laughed when I told her

686
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:36,898
that the ballet painting had been sold for 100 francs.

687
00:54:37,066 --> 00:54:39,192
You mean she's already taken the new apartment?

688
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,653
Yeah, moved into it this morning.

689
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:46,241
Oh, Paul, I'm terribly sorry.

690
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:50,536
Am I supposed to accept it? What do I do, Jeanne?

691
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:53,498
She always wanted so much.

692
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:56,209
Why couldn't she have waited for your success?

693
00:54:56,377 --> 00:54:58,294
As you would?

694
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:03,925
She's my wife, not a friend. There's a difference.

695
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:07,387
Yes, there's a difference.

696
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:13,518
I found this in her dresser drawer after she'd moved.

697
00:55:22,695 --> 00:55:23,987
A magistrate?

698
00:55:23,988 --> 00:55:28,324
Yes, a rich man, a man of position.

699
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:31,536
Who else do we know could afford 10 francs an hour?

700
00:55:31,704 --> 00:55:34,080
But how can you be sure?

701
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:36,499
When she left, she said she was going to have

702
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:39,627
all the things I could never give her.

703
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:43,673
I didn't know what she meant then. I do now.

704
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:46,509
Paul, she's still married to you.

705
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:47,969
Yes.

706
00:55:48,137 --> 00:55:49,137
And as long as she is,

707
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:52,348
that's the one thing he can't give her.

708
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:06,904
To my future wife, who taught me how to laugh again.

709
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:13,161
Simon.

710
00:56:13,329 --> 00:56:16,247
Simon, would it matter very much to you

711
00:56:16,415 --> 00:56:20,084
if we didn't announce the wedding just yet?

712
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:21,961
Wait? But why?

713
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:25,548
Well, there's something I must take care of first.

714
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:27,550
But surely there's nothing so important that...

715
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:29,427
Oh, Simon, trust me, please.

716
00:56:29,595 --> 00:56:30,595
Of course, my dear.

717
00:56:30,763 --> 00:56:34,724
But I wanted to open our place on the lake at Lucerne.

718
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:36,809
The weather is still fine, and our honeymoon could be...

719
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:38,978
Oh, darling, I promise you,

720
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:42,357
nothing will stop us from having that honeymoon.

721
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,526
Pardon, sir, there's someone to see you.

722
00:56:45,694 --> 00:56:47,528
-At this hour? -Mr. Duclasse.

723
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:50,531
Duclasse, the artist?

724
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:52,200
Yes.

725
00:56:52,201 --> 00:56:54,160
Well, have him wait.

726
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,874
What is it, Odette?

727
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:04,504
I wanted to have it settled before I told you.

728
00:57:04,505 --> 00:57:07,340
Well, does Duclasse mean anything to you?

729
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:11,761
He is my husband.

730
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:14,263
Oh, Simon, we're separated.

731
00:57:14,473 --> 00:57:17,475
I've told him I'll never go back to him.

732
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:23,106
Simon, I don't want to go through another scene with him.

733
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:26,859
I understand.

734
00:57:43,544 --> 00:57:47,422
Good evening, Mr. Duclasse. This way, please.

735
00:57:53,053 --> 00:57:55,513
You were the one who bought the painting.

736
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,058
Oh, be assured, I am an admirer of your work.

737
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:00,435
And of my wife.

738
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:02,186
Well, then, we have much in common.

739
00:58:02,354 --> 00:58:04,105
Won't you sit down?

740
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:08,860
You do admit you are the reason Odette left me.

741
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:12,155
I do not. I only know that she had left you.

742
00:58:12,865 --> 00:58:15,241
I want you to leave her alone.

743
00:58:15,451 --> 00:58:17,285
But, Mr. Duclasse, Odette is no child.

744
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,494
She has made a choice.

745
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:20,037
Choice? And what did she choose?

746
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:21,873
This big house, your money.

747
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,125
I sympathize with you.

748
00:58:24,293 --> 00:58:27,545
But I prefer to believe that she has found it possible

749
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:29,672
to think of me as a man she wants.

750
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,300
And if I refuse to give you the divorce?

751
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:35,511
Do you really think it would make any difference?

752
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:40,266
She has already intimated to me that she prefers me on any terms.

753
00:58:40,476 --> 00:58:41,642
I could kill you for that.

754
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:43,144
You are in my house,

755
00:58:43,312 --> 00:58:45,104
and I am trying to be as kind as possible

756
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:46,522
under the circumstances.

757
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,524
I don't need your kindness, Magistrate.

758
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:50,651
Well, what else have I to offer you?

759
00:58:51,737 --> 00:58:54,655
I love Odette, and I will not give her up.

760
00:58:54,823 --> 00:58:59,368
And what of your fine reputation if this were made public?

761
00:59:00,913 --> 00:59:02,705
Are you threatening me?

762
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:04,624
Yes.

763
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:07,251
Think about it, Magistrate.

764
00:59:09,755 --> 00:59:12,632
He will be trouble, Simon. Kill him!

765
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:17,762
Kill him? No!

766
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:20,306
No, you cannot make me commit murder!

767
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:36,781
What happened?

768
00:59:36,949 --> 00:59:39,242
It almost fell on me.

769
00:59:45,499 --> 00:59:49,377
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

770
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:54,340
It would have been a most convenient accident, wouldn't it?

771
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:56,717
Mr. Duclasse, I...

772
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:00,096
Those urns have been up there since the house was built.

773
01:00:00,264 --> 01:00:02,014
How could it have fallen?

774
01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:04,392
It's all right, Pierre.

775
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:07,812
You may clean this up in the morning.

776
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:09,522
Yes, sir.

777
01:00:13,902 --> 01:00:17,196
-I'm frightened, Pierre. -Shh.

778
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,417
You tried to kill him.

779
01:00:29,585 --> 01:00:33,546
No, we are not ready for his death yet.

780
01:00:33,714 --> 01:00:37,383
That was merely to show you how simple killing can be.

781
01:00:37,593 --> 01:00:41,220
As simple as crushing the life from a bird.

782
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:45,057
But you cannot make me take a human life.

783
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:49,437
Not as long as there is a shred of my will left.

784
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:53,566
You've already started to murder him

785
01:00:53,734 --> 01:00:56,777
by taking the one thing he loved.

786
01:00:56,945 --> 01:01:02,658
The time will come, Magistrate, and you will end his agony.

787
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:05,119
No!

788
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:29,894
Has Paul gone?

789
01:01:30,062 --> 01:01:33,439
Yes. Odette, we can't stay here.

790
01:01:33,649 --> 01:01:34,815
I want to leave Paris.

791
01:01:34,983 --> 01:01:37,026
Tell me that you'll come to Lucerne with me now.

792
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:38,361
But what of Paul?

793
01:01:38,362 --> 01:01:41,489
Well, I have some influence. Perhaps I can arrange an annulment.

794
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,491
We'll be married in Switzerland.

795
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,951
But I want to leave this house as soon as possible tomorrow.

796
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:46,952
Can you be ready?

797
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,330
Oh, Simon, what is it? Is Paul causing trouble?

798
01:01:49,498 --> 01:01:51,666
Please, tell me, will you go?

799
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:54,669
Of course, Simon. I'll be ready.

800
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:57,630
The servants will leave immediately. There's a train at midnight.

801
01:01:57,798 --> 01:02:00,091
They'll have the villa ready for us by the time we get there.

802
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:03,302
We'll leave on the morning train. I'll pick you up at 10:00.

803
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:07,223
We'll be happy, Simon. I know we will.

804
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:10,309
We must take whatever happiness we can, Odette.

805
01:02:11,395 --> 01:02:13,145
That's all we can do.

806
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:14,897
Come.

807
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:46,721
You're here, aren't you?

808
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:49,098
You've been here all the time.

809
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:53,227
You must admit that patience is a virtue.

810
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:56,355
Are you running from me, Magistrate?

811
01:02:56,523 --> 01:02:58,357
Yes!

812
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:05,114
The human body is so fragile.

813
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:10,369
It withers and dies so easily, as a flower does.

814
01:03:13,749 --> 01:03:17,084
Do you think that by putting distance between yourself and Paul Duclasse,

815
01:03:17,252 --> 01:03:20,087
that I can't make you kill him?

816
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:26,427
You say the Horla exist as people do?

817
01:03:27,012 --> 01:03:30,514
Very well, then, your powers must be limited as ours are.

818
01:03:31,767 --> 01:03:33,559
Do you think that I'll let you run

819
01:03:33,769 --> 01:03:36,771
so that you can share your life with that woman?

820
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:39,565
I will not be stopped.

821
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:41,776
You'll share nothing!

822
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:46,322
As this rose is destroyed, so can I destroy your resistance.

823
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:49,450
Every thought you think, your senses, your will,

824
01:03:49,618 --> 01:03:52,161
they belong to me to use as I wish.

825
01:03:58,168 --> 01:04:02,046
No more bullets left, Magistrate.

826
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:08,177
The woman is useless to us,

827
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:12,306
as useless as any dead thing.

828
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:15,476
What are you saying?

829
01:04:15,644 --> 01:04:19,563
A dead thing owns nothing,

830
01:04:19,731 --> 01:04:23,984
possesses no one, Magistrate.

831
01:04:24,152 --> 01:04:27,780
That is what she must be.

832
01:04:27,948 --> 01:04:32,201
I can't.

833
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:36,413
A dead thing, Magistrate.

834
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:00,646
Who is it?

835
01:05:00,856 --> 01:05:03,482
Odette, I must talk to you.

836
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:05,651
Paul, go away. Leave me alone.

837
01:05:07,946 --> 01:05:10,990
You're my wife! You owe me this much!

838
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:15,286
All right, all right! Stop it! You'll break down the door.

839
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:20,374
Odette, I...

840
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:23,544
Where are you going?

841
01:05:23,712 --> 01:05:26,714
-None of your business. -You...

842
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,757
You're going with him?

843
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:31,427
My things!

844
01:05:31,595 --> 01:05:35,306
My things! Get out! You're not gonna spoil it for me!

845
01:05:35,307 --> 01:05:37,057
Odette, I can't let you do this to either of us.

846
01:05:37,225 --> 01:05:38,350
I'd rather see you dead.

847
01:05:38,518 --> 01:05:40,978
Doesn't it matter what I want?

848
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:44,440
Maybe I should feel sorry for him.

849
01:05:44,608 --> 01:05:47,359
You'll bleed him dry, take every cent he's got,

850
01:05:47,527 --> 01:05:49,403
and meanwhile be looking for another man

851
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:50,362
with even more money.

852
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:54,199
Yes. Yes, that's exactly what I'll do.

853
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:55,993
Are you satisfied?

854
01:05:56,161 --> 01:06:01,165
Yes, I'm satisfied that I'm a fool and that he's a bigger one.

855
01:06:25,357 --> 01:06:28,150
Why, Simon, I didn't expect...

856
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:47,169
No!

857
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:03,454
-Good morning, Magistrate. -Good morning, Master.

858
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:04,705
I expected Pierre.

859
01:08:04,873 --> 01:08:08,000
Pierre and Louise have left for my place in Switzerland.

860
01:08:08,168 --> 01:08:11,295
Please forward my mail there until I notify you.

861
01:08:11,463 --> 01:08:14,006
-I'll be very glad to, sir. -Thank you.

862
01:08:28,396 --> 01:08:30,355
Blood?

863
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:50,084
Odette?

864
01:09:14,943 --> 01:09:16,819
No!

865
01:09:46,391 --> 01:09:48,392
You murdered her!

866
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,686
You're quite wrong, Magistrate.

867
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:51,979
You killed her.

868
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:54,398
It was your hand.

869
01:09:54,566 --> 01:09:55,691
No!

870
01:09:55,859 --> 01:09:59,653
Can you deny the evidence you've hidden in the clay?

871
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:04,324
I couldn't have done it. I never left the house!

872
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:07,744
That's right, Magistrate.

873
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:11,582
I'm the only one who knows you left here last night.

874
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:14,793
You're quite safe, I assure you.

875
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:19,006
I didn't do it. I didn't kill her.

876
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:23,594
The murderer Girot never thought he killed either.

877
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:29,850
Had you learned to love her, Magistrate?

878
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:54,833
-Father. -What is it?

879
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:57,669
The police, they've arrested Paul.

880
01:10:57,837 --> 01:11:00,839
Paul? For killing Odette?

881
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:03,759
But why? I don't understand.

882
01:11:03,927 --> 01:11:06,595
The landlady identified him.

883
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:10,974
She heard him arguing with Odette. There was a struggle.

884
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:14,770
Paul wouldn't have done it. He loved her.

885
01:11:14,938 --> 01:11:16,855
The police will learn the truth, Jeanne.

886
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:19,358
We know that Paul is innocent. They will find it out.

887
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:21,860
He doesn't even have money for a good lawyer.

888
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:25,614
Whatever we have will be his if he needs it.

889
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:36,959
Helen, if only it was in my power to bring you back.

890
01:11:37,752 --> 01:11:40,587
So that I could tell you how meaningless my life became

891
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:43,465
when you were no longer with me.

892
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:47,844
Tragedy can blind the judgment of a man.

893
01:11:49,097 --> 01:11:51,348
I know you would understand that.

894
01:11:56,604 --> 01:12:00,899
What is it, Magistrate? Are you talking to memories now?

895
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:03,318
Do you think she can hear you?

896
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:07,155
My heart has spoken to her many times.

897
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:09,491
Yes, she can hear me!

898
01:12:11,786 --> 01:12:15,580
Fool. Do you expect me to have patience with sentiment?

899
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:18,125
You had no reason to do that!

900
01:12:18,126 --> 01:12:20,836
You were only talking to your conscience, Magistrate.

901
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:23,338
You're still a murderer.

902
01:12:23,923 --> 01:12:29,136
And if I am, then I will not let an innocent man die

903
01:12:29,137 --> 01:12:31,013
for something I did.

904
01:12:31,014 --> 01:12:32,639
On the contrary.

905
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:36,143
Paul Duclasse will go to the guillotine.

906
01:12:36,144 --> 01:12:38,395
Haven't you done enough?

907
01:12:39,314 --> 01:12:41,148
Why should I let them execute you, Magistrate,

908
01:12:41,316 --> 01:12:43,942
when you serve my purpose so well?

909
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:46,320
Cover your victim with this.

910
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:51,408
I...

911
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:54,745
I can't, I can't!

912
01:12:54,746 --> 01:12:58,248
You think I'm so stupid as to let the police find it?

913
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:03,503
The grave is waiting.

914
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:07,466
Do as I say.

915
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:28,779
To the back of the garden, Magistrate.

916
01:13:35,536 --> 01:13:38,622
You see, I can be most accommodating.

917
01:13:38,623 --> 01:13:41,792
The grave is already dug.

918
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:46,963
You used clay to make her like this.

919
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:49,549
She returns to clay.

920
01:14:03,648 --> 01:14:06,316
When the grave is filled,

921
01:14:06,317 --> 01:14:10,028
we will remove the last vestige of the woman from your life.

922
01:14:21,124 --> 01:14:26,837
The painting, Magistrate. It, too, must be destroyed.

923
01:14:26,838 --> 01:14:30,465
Leave me alone! Let me have peace!

924
01:14:31,801 --> 01:14:36,721
I doubt whether such art is meant for immortality.

925
01:14:41,602 --> 01:14:43,145
Burn it.

926
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:48,775
No. No, I've done enough.

927
01:14:48,776 --> 01:14:51,278
There's the fire. You burn it.

928
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:53,697
You heard what I said.

929
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:58,952
Do as I say. Burn it!

930
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:28,607
The police, Magistrate.

931
01:15:34,489 --> 01:15:38,366
You will tell them only what I want you to tell them.

932
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,684
-Robert. -Good evening, Simon.

933
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:06,102
Come in, come in.

934
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:10,815
It is not often that I am honored by your presence.

935
01:16:11,234 --> 01:16:15,111
A policeman isn't supposed to have time for his friends.

936
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:17,864
If it isn't one thing, it's another.

937
01:16:17,865 --> 01:16:20,283
Now, this stupid murder.

938
01:16:20,284 --> 01:16:23,537
Oh, yes, yes. It's a terrible thing.

939
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:29,084
A glass of wine, Robert?

940
01:16:29,085 --> 01:16:30,961
No, I can only stay a minute.

941
01:16:30,962 --> 01:16:33,088
Oh, then, this isn't a social call.

942
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:36,383
Yes and no. I have to ask a favor of you.

943
01:16:36,551 --> 01:16:39,177
Oh? Well, sit down.

944
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:43,181
This murderer Duclasse, he wants to talk to you.

945
01:16:43,182 --> 01:16:45,141
To me? But whatever for?

946
01:16:45,142 --> 01:16:48,144
Well, he seems to have the idea that you'll help him.

947
01:16:48,896 --> 01:16:51,356
But I don't even know the man.

948
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:54,985
Many people know your reputation as a man who works hard for justice.

949
01:16:54,986 --> 01:16:56,820
Oh, I see.

950
01:16:56,821 --> 01:16:59,698
Frankly, Simon, I don't think anybody can help him.

951
01:16:59,699 --> 01:17:01,825
We have the testimony of his landlady

952
01:17:01,826 --> 01:17:05,036
and other people in the house who recalled his wife.

953
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:06,997
End earlier this morning we found the murder weapon

954
01:17:06,998 --> 01:17:08,582
hidden in his bedroom.

955
01:17:10,668 --> 01:17:14,462
The examining magistrate already has the case.

956
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,840
Yes, he says there's no doubt about it.

957
01:17:16,841 --> 01:17:19,593
Everything points to Duclasse as the killer.

958
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:22,971
Might be very interesting.

959
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:25,890
Still studying the criminal mind.

960
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:29,269
It's a fascinating subject, Robert.

961
01:17:29,937 --> 01:17:33,023
Bring Duclasse to my chambers. I'll talk with him.

962
01:17:33,024 --> 01:17:36,234
I can see you've earned your reputation honestly.

963
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:37,902
Tomorrow, noon.

964
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:40,697
-Good night, Simon. -Good night.

965
01:17:52,043 --> 01:17:54,210
Oh, Captain. Magistrate Cordier is waiting.

966
01:17:54,211 --> 01:17:56,463
Go right in, please.

967
01:17:59,133 --> 01:18:02,761
Magistrate, this is the man, Duclasse.

968
01:18:04,722 --> 01:18:06,640
Sit down, Duclasse.

969
01:18:08,893 --> 01:18:12,437
I thought you would see me alone.

970
01:18:12,438 --> 01:18:15,106
You're lucky to be seeing him at all. Say what you have to say.

971
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:17,233
What makes you think I can help you, Duclasse?

972
01:18:18,986 --> 01:18:21,488
Because you know I wouldn't kill Odette.

973
01:18:21,489 --> 01:18:24,240
How can you assume such a thing?

974
01:18:24,241 --> 01:18:25,909
I don't know you.

975
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:27,577
You knew my wife well enough.

976
01:18:27,578 --> 01:18:30,789
-Duclasse! -Please, Captain.

977
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:34,000
Under what circumstances could I have known your wife?

978
01:18:35,294 --> 01:18:38,171
Are you denying that you wanted to marry her?

979
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:43,343
This is preposterous, Duclasse. You're making a grave mistake.

980
01:18:43,344 --> 01:18:45,303
Liar! What are you trying to hide?

981
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:47,180
That you would take another man's wife away?

982
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:50,266
That's enough, Duclasse! Guards!

983
01:18:50,476 --> 01:18:51,935
I didn't kill Odette!

984
01:18:54,021 --> 01:18:55,897
Duclasse.

985
01:18:57,108 --> 01:18:58,858
If you think these accusations

986
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:02,278
will influence the court to declare you insane,

987
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:04,197
you are quite mistaken.

988
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:06,116
-Take him away. -I won't let this rest!

989
01:19:06,117 --> 01:19:08,368
I didn't kill Odette! I didn't kill her!

990
01:19:08,369 --> 01:19:09,536
I didn't kill her!

991
01:19:10,538 --> 01:19:11,913
You see, Simon?

992
01:19:11,914 --> 01:19:14,499
What is there to understand about the human mind?

993
01:19:15,084 --> 01:19:16,501
A person becomes evil.

994
01:19:16,502 --> 01:19:18,420
How? Who knows?

995
01:19:18,421 --> 01:19:22,882
He is evil, so society must crush him as if he were a bug.

996
01:19:22,883 --> 01:19:25,510
You think your studies are profound.

997
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:28,972
I think that the only profound thing is the guillotine.

998
01:19:30,725 --> 01:19:35,353
When I come across such a brutal killer as Duclasse,

999
01:19:35,354 --> 01:19:37,522
I begin to think you're right.

1000
01:19:37,523 --> 01:19:41,401
We must get together some evening and discuss our points of view.

1001
01:19:57,042 --> 01:20:00,420
Can it be only his reputation he's afraid of, Jeanne?

1002
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:05,258
To deny knowing Odette or me.

1003
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:11,097
Perhaps I had begun to hate Odette, but I never would have killed her.

1004
01:20:11,098 --> 01:20:15,185
Paul, Magistrate Cordier wouldn't let an innocent man die

1005
01:20:15,186 --> 01:20:17,395
just to save his own reputation.

1006
01:20:17,396 --> 01:20:18,563
Well, you should have seen him.

1007
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:20,482
There was no sympathy in him, nothing.

1008
01:20:20,483 --> 01:20:23,193
It was as if there were no feeling of any kind.

1009
01:20:23,194 --> 01:20:26,362
I don't even see any grief for Odette in him.

1010
01:20:26,363 --> 01:20:27,655
We're doing everything we can, Paul,

1011
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:30,283
and somehow we're going to find out the truth.

1012
01:20:36,415 --> 01:20:38,875
I know how much you and your father are trying to help me,

1013
01:20:38,876 --> 01:20:41,336
and I'm very grateful.

1014
01:20:42,963 --> 01:20:44,839
We don't want to lose you.

1015
01:20:48,803 --> 01:20:52,096
How can a man be such a fool about what is right?

1016
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:55,934
It's like an artist who wants to say something fine on a canvas

1017
01:20:55,935 --> 01:20:58,978
and only paints the things that blind his eye.

1018
01:21:03,818 --> 01:21:05,610
Oh, Paul.

1019
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:10,990
I wanted to kiss you when we were children.

1020
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:21,501
Oh, Paul, Paul.

1021
01:21:25,965 --> 01:21:27,924
What are we going to do?

1022
01:21:35,558 --> 01:21:40,311
There has to be a way to prove Cordier's relationship to Odette.

1023
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:43,398
Odette never lived in a world by herself.

1024
01:21:49,864 --> 01:21:52,115
I've learned today that I am to preside

1025
01:21:52,116 --> 01:21:54,617
at the trial of Paul Duclasse.

1026
01:21:54,618 --> 01:21:58,413
Whatever is left of my will, of my conscience, rebels

1027
01:21:58,414 --> 01:22:01,708
at sending an innocent man to the guillotine.

1028
01:22:01,709 --> 01:22:06,004
But I know now that I am helpless under the Horla's influence.

1029
01:22:06,005 --> 01:22:10,091
I have become a slave, a machine that must do his bidding.

1030
01:22:10,092 --> 01:22:13,261
I have but one means of escape.

1031
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:16,389
May the Lord see fit to grant me with mercy

1032
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:18,516
for what I am about to do.

1033
01:22:40,039 --> 01:22:42,290
Suicide, Magistrate?

1034
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:45,877
Did you think I would let your destruction be so simple?

1035
01:22:51,634 --> 01:22:54,052
Did you want the gun, Magistrate?

1036
01:23:04,772 --> 01:23:09,484
It seems that your will surrenders most reluctantly.

1037
01:23:09,485 --> 01:23:12,946
I must congratulate you on your strength of character.

1038
01:23:13,948 --> 01:23:17,825
Well, then, since I have regained control once more, we can...

1039
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:23,831
The door, Magistrate. Shall we see who it is?

1040
01:23:39,056 --> 01:23:41,015
Is there something you wish?

1041
01:23:41,892 --> 01:23:44,811
Don't you remember me, Magistrate Cordier?

1042
01:23:44,812 --> 01:23:49,440
No, I'm sorry. Is there someone here you wish to see?

1043
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:52,110
Your memory is short. I'm Jeanne D'Arville.

1044
01:23:52,111 --> 01:23:55,196
You bought a painting from me at my father's gallery.

1045
01:23:55,197 --> 01:23:59,158
A painting? Oh, won't you please come in.

1046
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:07,709
You must have the wrong address. Perhaps I can help you.

1047
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:09,961
That's very possible.

1048
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:14,173
Would your coachman have taken the wrong turn?

1049
01:24:14,174 --> 01:24:18,428
I'm very good at remembering faces, Magistrate, even if you're not.

1050
01:24:23,809 --> 01:24:28,146
A man has little difficulty recalling a pretty face, Miss D'Arville.

1051
01:24:28,147 --> 01:24:31,274
Now, perhaps we can get to the bottom of this.

1052
01:24:31,275 --> 01:24:32,734
Oh, won't you sit down?

1053
01:24:32,735 --> 01:24:34,652
No, thank you.

1054
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:38,156
You denied knowing either Odette Mallotte or Paul Duclasse.

1055
01:24:38,157 --> 01:24:40,199
-Why? -Oh, that again!

1056
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:41,576
Is that what brought you here?

1057
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:43,286
I want to know why you lied.

1058
01:24:43,287 --> 01:24:46,205
Under the circumstances, I'm trying to be patient.

1059
01:24:46,206 --> 01:24:49,459
Paul Duclasse doesn't have time for patience.

1060
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:51,919
Since you won't tell me the truth, perhaps your servants will.

1061
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:53,421
Really, Miss D'Arville, I really think you...

1062
01:24:53,422 --> 01:24:55,214
Where are they?

1063
01:24:55,215 --> 01:24:56,841
They know Odette posed for you in this house.

1064
01:24:56,842 --> 01:24:58,676
They also know Paul was here.

1065
01:24:58,677 --> 01:25:02,597
I don't know where you and Duclasse got this ridiculous notion,

1066
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:06,225
but, unfortunately, my servants are in Switzerland.

1067
01:25:06,226 --> 01:25:10,229
Now, I trust that that is an end of your accusations.

1068
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:14,484
Oh, no, Magistrate Cordier, this isn't the end.

1069
01:25:14,485 --> 01:25:16,319
I'm sure the police will be interested

1070
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:19,489
in bringing your servants back from Switzerland for questioning,

1071
01:25:19,490 --> 01:25:22,784
even though you may prefer leaving them where they are.

1072
01:25:32,002 --> 01:25:33,795
Gallery D'Arville.

1073
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:48,935
A most determined young woman.

1074
01:25:48,936 --> 01:25:52,814
There can be no doubt that she will go to the police.

1075
01:25:52,815 --> 01:25:57,568
Then, I can only hope that nothing changes her mind.

1076
01:25:58,695 --> 01:26:01,656
You still want to die.

1077
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:05,535
You chose the wrong one for death, Magistrate.

1078
01:26:05,536 --> 01:26:08,913
She will die, not you.

1079
01:26:08,914 --> 01:26:11,499
Leave her alone.

1080
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:14,293
You will kill her.

1081
01:26:15,337 --> 01:26:19,757
No, I can't.

1082
01:26:20,759 --> 01:26:24,428
I can't kill again.

1083
01:26:29,685 --> 01:26:32,895
Before the night is over, Magistrate.

1084
01:26:33,063 --> 01:26:35,690
There isn't much time.

1085
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:43,030
But do you realize what this would mean?

1086
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:46,284
Accusing him before the police?

1087
01:26:46,285 --> 01:26:48,995
A man with such a fine reputation.

1088
01:26:48,996 --> 01:26:51,706
I already know what they think.

1089
01:26:51,707 --> 01:26:54,083
But Paul's entitled to justice.

1090
01:26:54,084 --> 01:26:55,459
And I'm going to demand

1091
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:58,379
that they bring the servants back to testify.

1092
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:00,798
Jeanne, you asked my advice.

1093
01:27:00,799 --> 01:27:03,968
I can only tell you that I believe it will be useless.

1094
01:27:03,969 --> 01:27:08,598
Father, I'm going to the police. It's all I can do to help Paul.

1095
01:27:11,018 --> 01:27:13,603
I hope you're right.

1096
01:27:13,604 --> 01:27:16,689
Perhaps I'm too old to believe in miracles.

1097
01:29:15,559 --> 01:29:20,938
Simon, what are you doing here at this time of the night?

1098
01:29:20,939 --> 01:29:27,194
Father Raymonde, quickly, take me to your church.

1099
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:28,988
Perhaps there is safety there.

1100
01:29:28,989 --> 01:29:31,073
Simon, what are you saying?

1101
01:29:31,074 --> 01:29:33,492
A sanctuary, Father.

1102
01:29:33,493 --> 01:29:36,412
There's something that I must tell you.

1103
01:29:36,413 --> 01:29:38,706
I must confess.

1104
01:29:45,964 --> 01:29:48,799
-Help me. -Come with me.

1105
01:29:54,014 --> 01:30:03,647
Woah!

1106
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:09,820
Father, are you all right?

1107
01:30:09,821 --> 01:30:11,489
What happened?

1108
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:13,491
Woah!

1109
01:30:22,376 --> 01:30:24,085
-You're not hurt? -No.

1110
01:30:24,086 --> 01:30:25,252
Thank the Lord.

1111
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:26,796
Father, it happened so suddenly,

1112
01:30:26,797 --> 01:30:29,006
as if someone grabbed the reins from my hands.

1113
01:30:29,007 --> 01:30:31,759
He tried to kill both of us.

1114
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:34,095
Kill us! Simon, please explain.

1115
01:30:34,096 --> 01:30:36,514
Father, I can't go with you now.

1116
01:30:36,515 --> 01:30:38,808
It would mean your life, too.

1117
01:30:38,809 --> 01:30:40,810
Listen to me, do as I say.

1118
01:30:40,811 --> 01:30:42,603
There's a girl walking down the street.

1119
01:30:42,604 --> 01:30:44,939
She can't be more than a few blocks away.

1120
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:46,857
You'll recognize her by the brown dress

1121
01:30:46,858 --> 01:30:48,859
and the plume hat she's wearing.

1122
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:51,529
Her name is Jeanne D'Arville.

1123
01:30:51,530 --> 01:30:55,074
Tell her that I must see her tonight at my house.

1124
01:30:55,075 --> 01:30:58,244
Please, tell her to come.

1125
01:31:04,876 --> 01:31:06,961
The Horla has tried to kill me.

1126
01:31:06,962 --> 01:31:10,256
I have become his enemy instead of his slave.

1127
01:31:10,424 --> 01:31:13,259
It is now his life or mine.

1128
01:31:28,233 --> 01:31:31,026
Father, are you sure he wanted me to come back?

1129
01:31:31,027 --> 01:31:35,573
I don't know what is wrong, but it was most important to him.

1130
01:31:46,084 --> 01:31:49,837
Father, thank you for coming.

1131
01:31:49,838 --> 01:31:52,756
Forgive me, but I can't ask you in.

1132
01:31:52,757 --> 01:31:54,383
I hope there's time enough for this.

1133
01:31:54,384 --> 01:31:57,720
Simon, there must be something very wrong. Can't I help?

1134
01:31:57,721 --> 01:32:01,015
No. No, this is something I must do myself.

1135
01:32:01,016 --> 01:32:03,017
Pray for me, Father.

1136
01:32:03,018 --> 01:32:06,729
Take these. They're most important.

1137
01:32:06,730 --> 01:32:09,106
It's imperative that you follow the instructions

1138
01:32:09,107 --> 01:32:10,357
in the letter exactly.

1139
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:12,193
-I don't know what these are. -Please.

1140
01:32:12,194 --> 01:32:13,903
Please take her away, Father.

1141
01:32:13,904 --> 01:32:15,321
Go, I beg of you.

1142
01:32:15,489 --> 01:32:17,323
Simon, you will have my prayers.

1143
01:32:17,324 --> 01:32:19,158
I think we better do as he says.

1144
01:32:19,159 --> 01:32:21,327
-Good night. -Good night, Father.

1145
01:32:31,671 --> 01:32:34,089
Something has occurred to me.

1146
01:32:34,090 --> 01:32:37,343
Something that happened the night the Horla made me destroy

1147
01:32:37,511 --> 01:32:39,762
the painting of Odette.

1148
01:32:39,763 --> 01:32:44,350
If my observation is correct, then I will be staking my life

1149
01:32:44,351 --> 01:32:48,312
on the turn of one solitary card.

1150
01:32:50,565 --> 01:32:56,111
If I am wrong, then, this will be my last meeting with him.

1151
01:32:56,112 --> 01:32:58,072
He will kill me.

1152
01:32:58,073 --> 01:33:02,576
I have made my preparations. I am ready.

1153
01:33:22,138 --> 01:33:24,974
You seem very smug, Magistrate.

1154
01:33:24,975 --> 01:33:28,602
Is it because I failed to make you kill the girl?

1155
01:33:30,272 --> 01:33:34,817
Do you think that evil can always be stopped by a cross?

1156
01:33:34,818 --> 01:33:36,360
Perhaps not,

1157
01:33:36,361 --> 01:33:41,949
but there may be something that can stop your evil.

1158
01:33:47,038 --> 01:33:48,998
You remember the painting?

1159
01:33:48,999 --> 01:33:51,375
How you insisted that I burn it?

1160
01:33:51,376 --> 01:33:55,462
Could it be that you were afraid to go near the flames in the fireplace?

1161
01:33:56,172 --> 01:33:59,300
Fire has no will of its own! Can you control it?

1162
01:33:59,301 --> 01:34:03,762
Try! Let me see how fast your powers are!

1163
01:34:03,763 --> 01:34:04,930
Let me out!

1164
01:34:04,931 --> 01:34:06,974
There's no place to run.

1165
01:34:06,975 --> 01:34:09,268
The windows are in flames. The doors are locked.

1166
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:13,105
Let me out! You're trapped.

1167
01:34:13,106 --> 01:34:15,941
The whole room is drenched in kerosene.

1168
01:34:19,529 --> 01:34:21,071
How does terror feel?

1169
01:34:21,072 --> 01:34:23,657
Doesn't it give you enough strength to break a lock?

1170
01:34:25,452 --> 01:34:26,869
Let me out!

1171
01:34:27,454 --> 01:34:29,622
I was right about the fire.

1172
01:34:29,623 --> 01:34:31,457
Then, you'll die with...

1173
01:35:31,935 --> 01:35:35,104
The last words he wrote:

1174
01:35:35,105 --> 01:35:37,147
"If what I think is true,

1175
01:35:37,148 --> 01:35:39,316
then, there may be deliverance from the Horla

1176
01:35:39,317 --> 01:35:42,069
for me or all of us."

1177
01:35:43,113 --> 01:35:47,074
Are you convinced now that Paul didn't murder Odette?

1178
01:35:47,075 --> 01:35:49,576
The diary will clear him.

1179
01:35:49,577 --> 01:35:51,704
Poor Simon.

1180
01:35:52,247 --> 01:35:55,416
He was ill for so long. The insanity grew worse.

1181
01:35:55,417 --> 01:35:57,126
He didn't know what he was doing.

1182
01:35:57,127 --> 01:36:00,295
This Horla, it was in his imagination, of course.

1183
01:36:00,296 --> 01:36:04,925
Can it be denied that evil exists or that it can possess a man?

1184
01:36:04,926 --> 01:36:08,554
Then, Cordier was saying the Horla is real.

1185
01:36:08,722 --> 01:36:12,015
Simon's letter spoke of a warning to mankind.

1186
01:36:12,517 --> 01:36:14,435
He wanted us to know.

1187
01:36:14,436 --> 01:36:18,480
Whenever evil exists in the heart of man,

1188
01:36:18,481 --> 01:36:21,108
the Horla lives.
