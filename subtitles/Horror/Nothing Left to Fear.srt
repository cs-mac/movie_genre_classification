1
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,623
( cow moos )

2
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:21,173
( man speaking on radio )

3
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:24,276
( people chattering )

4
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,748
Exactly what
Pastor Kingsman said--

5
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,317
you take a--
off the turnpike, six miles on--

6
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,753
- He doesn't know.
- I didn't think so. ( giggles )

7
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:36,622
What's it called--
the first road? Lime Road?

8
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:39,224
- Old Lime Road.
- Rebecca, help your dad out
here.

9
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:41,393
Rebecca.

10
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:43,462
I think we're lost.

11
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,167
- Sorry, Dad.
- Okay. All right.

12
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:49,835
- Wendy: I saw these before.
- Saw what?

13
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:52,137
This. It all looks the same.
I don't know.

14
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:53,839
If you took the right,
left at the right--

15
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:56,108
- Mary: You can't even hit me
back.
- Wendy: --at the right barn.

16
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,143
Or was it the left, left
at the right barn?

17
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:00,412
Mary: Do you remember
when he took the wrong exit?

18
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:02,247
- Rebecca: Right?
- Mary: We ended up going...

19
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:03,982
- Dan: No, no, that's not--
- Wendy: Twice.

20
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:05,584
- No, that's not true.
- He did it twice.

21
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:07,319
- It was not properly marked.
- Mary: He did it twice.

22
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:09,254
- It was not properly marked.
- Wendy: You circled twice.

23
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:11,990
( Dan chuckles )

24
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:13,792
Dan: Okay, ha-ha.
Listen, this is--

25
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:16,195
- that was the right barn.
- ( Wendy sighs )

26
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:18,063
I'm pretty sure
that this was the right road.

27
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:19,598
Rebecca:
Well, I mean,

28
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,168
it's not that I don't trust your
keen sense of judgment, Captain,

29
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,004
but why don't we just
stop and ask?

30
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,806
( man speaking on radio )

31
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,841
Wendy:
There's an idea.

32
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,777
Come on, ask, ask.

33
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:33,812
( all chanting )
Ask, ask, ask, ask.

34
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:36,048
Ask, ask ask.

35
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,350
Dan: I'm gonna go in here
and check it out.

36
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:42,254
- I listen to my family.
- Wendy: Wrong turn.

37
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:45,424
Is there-- is there--
is there a fellow there?

38
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:48,193
Christopher:
Oh, my God.

39
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:50,462
( Mary mocking )
Oh, my God.

40
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,333
( all chattering )

41
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,237
Wendy:
That's enough.

42
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,572
Dan:
Whew!

43
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,274
Hallelujah!

44
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:04,843
Wendy: All right,
there is a word I like to hear.

45
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:08,247
Let's be saying it
when we find out where we are.

46
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,718
Oh, that's nice.
Isn't that pretty?

47
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,622
For the tenth time
that we've seen it today.

48
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:18,323
I know.

49
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:20,459
Sorry, Dan.

50
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:22,527
I'll go up and check.

51
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:25,631
- Okay, Christopher.
- Wendy: Take the boy.

52
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:28,066
- Let's go.
- Dad.

53
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:30,102
See you in a minute.

54
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:32,004
Wendy:
Good luck.

55
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:42,614
Something tells me
this town won't have a mall.

56
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,650
( scoffs )
A mall?

57
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:47,886
Come on, I'll settle
for indoor bathrooms.

58
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:50,389
- ( flies buzzing )
- ( dog barking )

59
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:02,167
- ( horse snorting )
- ( chimes tinkling )

60
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,236
Hello?

61
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:11,043
Hello! Anyone here?

62
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,750
Hello!

63
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,005
Excuse me.
You folks looking for something?

64
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:43,375
Sorry. Yeah, we saw
your farm here and--

65
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:44,976
You lost or something?

66
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:48,313
Well, to be honest,
I think we may be a little lost.

67
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:50,749
There's a gas station a couple
miles back the way you came.

68
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:52,718
You can get a map
from them.

69
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,021
Okay. I was just-- I was just
looking for a town called Stull.

70
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:59,324
I think we took a wrong turn
a mile or so back.

71
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:01,827
So we'll get out of your hair.
Sorry for having bothered you.

72
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:04,563
You wouldn't be
the new pastor, would you?

73
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:07,933
Well, actually, yes.
How did you know that?

74
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:10,802
Well, Pastor Kingsman asked me
to keep an eye out for you,

75
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:13,138
make sure you're okay.

76
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,108
I'm just so glad
that you made it, Pastor.

77
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,542
I was starting to get
a little worried.

78
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,311
Your moving truck passed by
a couple of hours ago.

79
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:21,646
Oh, that's good to hear.

80
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:23,815
I know my wife will certainly
be happy to hear that.

81
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:25,450
Are we far from town?

82
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:30,021
Oh, no, no, not at all,
just a couple of miles or so.

83
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:32,991
I'm Pastor Dan Bramford.
Nice to meet you.

84
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,026
This is my son Christopher.
Christopher.

85
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:37,429
Oh, got a good grip
on you, boy.

86
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:39,331
Yeah.

87
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,634
I'm-- I'm Mason.

88
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,436
Nice to meet you.

89
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:46,271
I'll just--

90
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:48,840
I'll just bring my truck around.
You can follow me.

91
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,609
Okay, that's great.

92
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:52,444
I told you
we weren't lost.

93
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:55,213
- ( sheep bleating )
- ( cowbells dinging )

94
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:58,016
( dog barking )

95
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,568
Hey! Honey!

96
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,104
Welcome to Stull!

97
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,806
Wendy: Oh, no.
You gotta be kidding me.

98
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:24,042
Give me five.
I got you here.

99
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,077
You did it.

100
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,080
- I hate to say I told you so.
- ( laughs )

101
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:31,016
- All right.
- He's gonna come by with the
truck

102
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:32,651
and pick us up,
show us into town.

103
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:35,454
( sheep bleating loudly )

104
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:45,096
Oh, my God, what the hell
is that guy doing?

105
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:46,798
I don't know.

106
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,532
Oh. Oh, yuck.

107
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:23,535
Well, that is just not
appropriate
for you to see.

108
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:25,337
- Christopher: Eww.
- You, too.

109
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:28,440
- In the car. In the car.
- Come on, guys.

110
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:30,308
( car approaches )

111
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,444
- Are you folks ready?
- Yeah, we are.

112
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:34,579
I'll just drive right up there
and wait for you.

113
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:36,715
Thank you, Mason.

114
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:40,018
All right, kids just got
their first taste of the
country.

115
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,602
We won't need
these anymore.

116
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,575
Dan: It's not as small
as you thought it was, Rebecca.

117
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:06,278
- Mary: This is Main Street?
- Christopher: What's that?

118
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,346
- Dan: Ice cream?
- Christopher: Look.

119
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:12,284
( chuckles )
Christopher wants to go there.

120
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:14,653
( birds chirping )

121
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,468
- Dan: Is that us?
- ( Wendy chuckles ) I think.

122
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,772
- Is that us right there?
- This is--

123
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:35,507
- Is that it? Oh!
- Are you kidding me?

124
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:36,641
- That's it.
- Dan: Oh.

125
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:38,843
- Wendy: Can you believe it?
- Ma'am, I'm sorry

126
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:41,112
I didn't get a chance to meet
you
back at the farm, but I'm Mason.

127
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:43,148
Oh, I'm Wendy.

128
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,916
- Wendy: This is gorgeous.
- Oh my goodness.

129
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,751
Mason:
I'm glad you like it.

130
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,054
I'm just glad I showed you
where it was.

131
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:51,122
Wendy:
Oh, my.

132
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:54,492
Can you-- what's--
it's amazing.

133
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,562
Um, hi. Hi.

134
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:59,731
Excuse me.
( chuckles )

135
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:02,033
Wendy:
Be careful.

136
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,241
Becky-- uh, Rebecca.

137
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:12,544
It's okay, Dad.
You can still call me Becky.

138
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:15,814
It's-- it's really nice.

139
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:17,515
Yeah.

140
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,552
Big change.

141
00:10:20,554 --> 00:10:22,754
I know that you are gonna
make the most of it.

142
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:24,589
Wendy: Excuse me. Hi.
Thank you.

143
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,558
I gotta go
help your mom.

144
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,093
I-- I'm sorry.
Can you help me?

145
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:29,828
I'm so confused.
Where are the movers and--

146
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,863
Let me help you.

147
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:33,565
I don't know
what's going on.

148
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:35,667
Did the movers just leave
everything on the ground?

149
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:37,302
No, no, no, they were nice
fellows.
We just figured

150
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,471
you didn't want any strangers
traipsing through your house.

151
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,039
Some fellows from church
came by to help.

152
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,041
- Pastor Kingsman.
- Oh, Pastor Bramford.

153
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:44,709
- How are you?
- Good. Good.

154
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:46,444
I thought you were a mover.
I'm so sorry.

155
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:48,613
Well, today I'm a mover.
Who knows what I'll be tomorrow?

156
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:52,617
I know I speak for everybody
when I say
we're awfully glad you're here.

157
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:54,519
- Thank you.
- Well, I think six states,

158
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,521
three children,
countless rest stops--

159
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:59,658
- I think no one's happier than
we are.
- I expect that's true.

160
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,127
- Here, Dan.
- Sure.

161
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,895
- Fragile.
- Yeah, should we?

162
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:05,830
- Dining room?
- Dining room, gents.

163
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,667
- Kingsman: All right, let's go.
- You be the captain out there.

164
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,635
Captain, I know.
Thank you.

165
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:12,504
( chuckles )

166
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:15,640
Oh, yeah. Excuse me,
I think that goes into the
living room.

167
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:18,143
Thank you.
Hi, sweetheart.

168
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:20,545
- Hi.
- Can you believe it?

169
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:22,981
Um, kitchen.
Thank you.

170
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:27,719
Okay.

171
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,756
- Can you believe it?
- This place is so nice.

172
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:34,526
- Christopher: This place is
huge.
- I know, right?

173
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:37,228
- Mom, can I pick out my room?
- Well, yes, after your sisters,

174
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,330
'cause they're older than you,
so they get first choice.

175
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:41,366
- First choice?
- Wendy: First choice.

176
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,568
- Wendy: Second choice.
- Dan: Hey, girls, Christopher,

177
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,570
please say hello
to Pastor Kingsman.

178
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:47,272
The man responsible
for all of this.

179
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:49,574
Oh, well, I wouldn't say
I'm responsible.

180
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:52,177
I think a higher power
called you to our little town.

181
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:53,745
Well, certainly.
Thank you.

182
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:55,947
It's nice to meet you, girls.

183
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:57,782
- Nice to meet you.
- Go. Get up there.

184
00:11:57,784 --> 00:12:00,118
- Christopher: Stop pushing me.
- I'll help.

185
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,120
Stop.

186
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,693
- I like the window in here.
- This room is cool.

187
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:10,795
Christopher:
I saw it first. I call dibs.

188
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:12,263
Mary:
You heard what Mom said.

189
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:14,099
I'm older than you.
I get first dibs, kiddo.

190
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:16,167
Christopher:
Second dibs.

191
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:18,403
Mary: Second's better
than the third, you weirdo.

192
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,539
Christopher: What?
You didn't get the crappy third
one.

193
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:25,043
( birds chirping )

194
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:31,783
( door creaks )

195
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:14,325
Damn it.
Let me guess.

196
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,427
Yep. Mine.

197
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,952
( mouse squeaking )

198
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:45,990
Mom!

199
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,793
Oh, thank you so much.

200
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:52,897
This is incredible.
Everybody's so-- so sweet.

201
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:55,466
- And this kitchen is amazing.
- Well, I'm glad you like it.

202
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,769
I'm not much of a cook myself,
so I have to take your word for
it.

203
00:13:57,771 --> 00:13:59,804
- That's not your handiwork?
- Oh, no, no, no.

204
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:02,040
- That's-- that's Mrs. Gordon's.
- Oh.

205
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:04,809
She-- she's pretty famous
for her cakes around here.

206
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:06,878
- Looks delicious.
- They're good.

207
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,781
Yeah, melt your tongue
right off.

208
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:12,050
So, Dan,

209
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:13,885
what do you say
we rip the Band-Aid right off

210
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:15,687
and get you up
on that pulpit tomorrow?

211
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:17,722
- Oh. Oh. Oh.
- Wendy: Oh my goodness, Dan.

212
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:20,792
- I'm not sure that I'm ready.
- Kingsman: I know it's quick,

213
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:22,827
but folks are anxious
to meet their new pastor.

214
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:25,029
Well, you know,
he's got big shoes to fill.

215
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,098
- I'm sure they're gonna miss
you a lot.
- No, no, no.

216
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,435
I've been here a number of
years.
They're about ready to see me
move on.

217
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:33,738
- No. ( chuckles )
- I'm looking forward to
retirement.

218
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,741
I think it's about time
we had some new blood around
here.

219
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:38,810
- Oh.
- Well...

220
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:41,546
- Come on, sweetie.
- Kingsman: What do you say?

221
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,147
- Rip the Band-Aid right off.
- ( chuckles )

222
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:44,883
- Huh?
- All right.

223
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,151
( insects chirping )

224
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,132
How's the sermon going?

225
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:03,301
Oh, fine. Good.

226
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:06,104
The usual battle.

227
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:07,739
How are the girls?

228
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,807
They're good.

229
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,944
You did the right thing,
you know.

230
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:15,947
The house is perfect.

231
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:18,983
I'm almost finished unpacking
downstairs. It looks so good.

232
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:23,154
I'm glad
you're happy with it.

233
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:25,924
I think moving is always
hardest on the children.

234
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:28,993
- Yes, I know.
- The new school, the new
friends.

235
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:31,496
They'll adjust.
You know they will.

236
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:33,998
I think they're gonna like it.

237
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,568
It's not like we had
that much of a choice.

238
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,604
- No?
- No.

239
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,673
- We have a bigger boss.
- Oh.

240
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:43,942
He called you to be here.

241
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:48,413
As long as we're together,
that's all--

242
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:50,949
- Nothing else matters.
- Nothing else matters.

243
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,428
Rebecca:
I'm going with two years.

244
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,030
What, too little?
10 years.

245
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:08,933
10 years?
Are you kidding me?

246
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:11,970
No, they live
for about 45 days.

247
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:15,506
The stronger ones can live
a little longer, like 60 days.

248
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:18,242
10 years--
they'd have grey hair.

249
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:22,613
Yeah, I guess 10 years is kind
of
a long time for an ant to live,
huh?

250
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,649
Yeah.

251
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:28,152
Rebecca, do you think
I'll make friends here?

252
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,188
You kidding me?

253
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,590
You? Mr. Personality?

254
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,926
Of course you're gonna
make friends.

255
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:37,362
Think about how much
a big city slicker kid like you
knows

256
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:38,997
compared to these guys.

257
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:41,599
- Mary, honey.
- ( knocks )

258
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:43,534
- Guys.
- Mary: What?

259
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:46,404
- Dan: Are they here?
- Mary, come here, please.

260
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:49,007
- Put that away. Turn off the
light.
- Hi. Here.

261
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:52,043
It's our first night here and I
just
wanted to say a little
something.

262
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:54,112
Come on.

263
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,950
Hey.
A big change for us.

264
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:01,052
And your mother and I
would like you to know

265
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:02,987
how much we appreciate
the love and support

266
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:06,958
that each one of you has given
us
on our journey.

267
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,260
I think we had a great life
in the city,

268
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:12,497
but I believe the Lord
has called us here.

269
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:14,298
He didn't call me.

270
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,434
Okay, all right,
He called.

271
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:19,070
Okay, put our hands together.

272
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:21,973
Heavenly Father, thank You
for protecting us

273
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:23,408
on our long journey.

274
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,910
Please, we ask You
to watch over us and guide us...

275
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:28,312
( continues indistinctly )

276
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:35,653
( thunder crashing )

277
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:58,876
- ( thunder crashes )
- ( shrieks )

278
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,523
( roaring )

279
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,128
( screaming )

280
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:27,105
( gasps )

281
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:35,246
( church bells ringing )

282
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,449
Wendy:
Wait up for us.

283
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,485
( organ playing )

284
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:42,553
Dan:
Oh, good morning.

285
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:47,525
Wendy: Good morning.
Good morning.

286

298
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,025
Good morning, friends.

299
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:22,627
Good morning.

300
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:25,596
Now before I get started,
I promised Mr. Roberts

301
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:28,699
that I would mention that we
still need a few volunteers

302
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:30,968
to help us set up
for tomorrow's summer festival,

303
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,237
so if you have
a little extra time

304
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:35,106
and want to lend
a helping hand,

305
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:37,642
please see Carl
after the service.

306
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:39,377
Please be seated.

307
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,786
I have spent a lot of years

308
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:50,821
here with you

309
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:54,859
and I would like to believe
that through all those years

310
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:58,129
we have built a community
of love and faith.

311
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,366
I would also like to believe

312
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:05,836
that we have learned
to trust each other.

313
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:10,741
Now trust is
a very funny thing.

314
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:15,213
It requires absolute belief
in one's soul, a complete faith.

315
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:17,582
But it's different than faith.

316
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:21,052
Trust also obligates
the person that is being trusted

317
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:23,221
to do the best he can.

318
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:26,290
And so I am asking you
to trust me

319
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:28,593
one more time

320
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:30,661
as I prepare to leave you.

321
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:35,266
Today we welcome
the Bramfords.

322
00:20:35,268 --> 00:20:37,301
- ( applause )
- Pastor Dan,

323
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:40,204
his lovely wife Wendy
and their three beautiful
children

324
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:42,707
have all consented
to join us.

325
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:45,509
And I trust
that you will show them

326
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:47,578
the same love
and compassion

327
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,414
that you showed me
so many years ago.

328
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,617
The Bramfords

329
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:55,786
have made a great sacrifice
to be here with us.

330
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:58,789
So let us welcome them
with open hearts

331
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,825
- and open arms.
- ( applause )

332
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:04,262
Pastor Dan, your people.

333
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:07,498
Thank you.
Thank you.

334
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,272
Thank you,
Pastor Kingsman.

335
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:17,074
- And good morning, everyone.
- Good morning.

336
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:19,343
First of all I would like
to thank you

337
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:23,147
for welcoming my family and I
into your lives.

338
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:26,517
When I first received the offer

339
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:29,153
to become your pastor
here in Stull,

340
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:31,489
my wife Wendy and I

341
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:34,025
were unsure--

342
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:36,560
unsure about
moving a family

343
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:38,663
halfway across
the country,

344
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:41,032
unsure about
leaving behind

345
00:21:41,034 --> 00:21:44,168
a life that we had come
to know and understand,

346
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,438
unsure about
a new adventure.

347
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:52,176
But in times
of unsureness,

348
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:54,578
in times of great decision,

349
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,581
I put my faith in the Lord,

350
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,750
that He would provide for us,

351
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:02,353
that He had a plan for us.

352
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:08,125
I think my faith

353
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:11,195
was like a rock.

354
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:14,799
I was reminded of
Matthew, chapter 7, verse 24,

355
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:17,368
which I would like to read to
you
this morning.

356
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,971
( clears throat )

357
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:24,008
"Therefore whosoever heareth
these sayings of mine

358
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,610
and doeth them,

359
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:30,081
I will liken him
unto a wise man

360
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:33,150
which built his house
on a rock.

361
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:35,519
And the rain descended

362
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,588
and the floods came
and the winds blew

363
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,990
and beat upon that house.

364
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:42,026
And it fell not,

365
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:45,396
for it was founded
upon a rock.

366
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:48,199
And everyone that heareth
these sayings of mine

367
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:51,335
and doeth them not
shall be likened to a foolish
man

368
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:54,538
which built his house
upon the sand."

369
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,308
( all chattering )

370
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:00,311
Wendy:
So nice to meet you.

371
00:23:00,313 --> 00:23:02,380
Dan:
God bless. Thank you.

372
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:08,252
Wendy:
Thank you.

373
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:19,797
Not really your scene, huh?

374
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:22,733
What?

375
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,535
This whole thing.

376
00:23:24,537 --> 00:23:26,470
I saw you inside.
You weren't singing.

377
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:28,739
And then you left
during the sermon.

378
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,975
I could say the same for you.

379
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:33,677
Sounds like you were paying
more attention to what I was
doing.

380
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,746
Well, maybe,

381
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,948
but that's just 'cause you were
so obviously not into it.

382
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,584
Yeah, you're right.
I'm not much into singing

383
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,953
and just not big
on the whole sermon thing.

384
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:46,357
- No offense to your dad.
- None taken, trust me.

385
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:49,360
I saw you and your family
when you got into town
yesterday.

386
00:23:49,362 --> 00:23:51,395
I take it y'all met Mason.

387
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:53,431
Oh, Mason?
He's the farm guy?

388
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:56,434
Yeah. Yeah, the farm guy.

389
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:59,603
Okay, so then you were
the guy with the lambs and--

390
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:02,106
Technically they're sheep.

391
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:05,976
Wow. Well,
you clean up well.

392
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,317
Maybe I'll see you around
and show you the town.

393
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:16,387
Yeah, cool.
Yeah, that'd be awesome.

394
00:24:16,389 --> 00:24:18,422
( clicks tongue )

395
00:24:18,424 --> 00:24:20,458
"You clean up well"?

396
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,260
Idiot.

397
00:24:23,262 --> 00:24:25,463
Wendy:
I have a hard time believing

398
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:27,665
that your boxes are unpacked
and your room is clean.

399
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:29,400
- ( music playing over
headphones )
- Huh?

400
00:24:29,402 --> 00:24:32,136
Mom, stop. I'm hungry.
Do we have any food in the
house?

401
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:33,737
You're hungry?
Yeah, there's a little
something.

402
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:35,272
I'm sure you can make do.

403
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:37,608
- And my boxes are unpacked.
- Uh-huh.

404
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,478
- But define clean.
- Exactly what I thought.

405
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,513
You know I hate
living in the mess, honey.

406
00:24:42,515 --> 00:24:45,516
Relax. It's only been a day.
They're just boxes.

407
00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:48,252
- Breathe.
- I'll breathe when you help me
out.

408
00:24:48,254 --> 00:24:50,354
Oh, yeah.

409
00:24:50,356 --> 00:24:52,823
Okay, we are definitely
gonna need an escape plan.

410
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:56,360
I swear, if she brings up
unpacking
one more time, I'm gonna kill
her.

411
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:59,363
- ( Rebecca giggles )
- I'm serious. We need a plan.

412
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:01,432
Okay, like you mean the time
that we told Mom

413
00:25:01,434 --> 00:25:03,501
we were going to Sonia Rosen's
house to sleep over,

414
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:05,102
so that we could see
the Stone Roses?

415
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:07,571
Yeah, we probably should have
told
Sonia Martin about that plan.

416
00:25:07,573 --> 00:25:09,840
- Somehow I got blamed for that
one.
- You did not.

417
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,776
I got it way worse than you.
I was grounded for, like, two
months.

418
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:15,479
Remember? Because I should
have known better.

419
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:18,282
- Yeah, you should have known
better.
- ( Rebecca giggles )

420
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:20,451
Hey, what are you eating?
I'm starving.

421
00:25:20,453 --> 00:25:22,887
Just peanut butter and jam
I found on the counter.

422
00:25:22,889 --> 00:25:25,389
Mm, sounds appetizing.

423
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:30,194
Um, I would not do that
if I were you.

424
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:32,296
Mom said we're saving that
for after dinner tonight.

425
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:34,532
It's our first family dinner
in the new home,

426
00:25:34,534 --> 00:25:36,367
blah, blah, blah.

427
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:38,302
Oh, please.

428
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,938
No, seriously, dude, you know
how Mom gets about that shit.

429
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:44,375
None for me, thanks,
but when Mom kills you,

430
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:46,644
- I'll take your purple sweater.
- Fine.

431
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:00,958
Mm, so good.

432
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:08,732
( coughing )

433
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:11,168
Are you okay?

434
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:14,838
( Rebecca gasps )
Mary!

435
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,408
Oh, shit.

436
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:24,214
Oh, my God.
Jesus.

437
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:26,550
- Are you okay?
- What was that?

438
00:26:26,552 --> 00:26:28,619
I have no idea.

439
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,189
Eww.

440
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,492
Oh.

441
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:40,064
I can't believe
this came out.

442
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:45,336
- I know.
- Holy shit.

443
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,711
- ( knocks on door )
- ( gasps ) Fuck.

444
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:01,085
Hi. What are you
doing here?

445
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:04,254
I told you I was gonna take you
around and show you some stuff.

446
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:05,689
Oh, yeah.

447
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:07,758
I just didn't know
you meant today.

448
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,361
Is today bad?

449
00:27:10,363 --> 00:27:12,429
No. Come in.

450
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,803
What happened?

451
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,872
You have no idea.

452
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:27,411
- Who puts a tooth in a cake?
- Tell me about it.

453
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:29,279
It cut the crap
out of the roof of my mouth.

454
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:33,217
This is one of
old Mrs. Gordon's cakes.

455
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:36,420
A nice lady,
but she's almost 95.

456
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:38,455
Let's just say you're lucky
this is all you found.

457
00:27:38,457 --> 00:27:40,524
Lucky?

458
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:56,040
There. No more cake.

459
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:58,075
So are you ready to go?

460
00:27:58,077 --> 00:27:59,677
Um...

461
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,813
Just go, Becca.
I'm fine. Go. Escape.

462
00:28:02,815 --> 00:28:05,549
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'll be fine.

463
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:08,552
A little weirded out,
but I'm fine.

464
00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:10,621
Okay.

465
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,491
Bye.

466
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:26,296
Rebecca:
So, not that this hasn't been
great,

467
00:29:26,298 --> 00:29:29,199
it has,

468
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:32,536
but is there anything
to actually do in town?

469
00:29:32,538 --> 00:29:34,738
This isn't exactly
the big city.

470
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,976
I know it's not the big city,
but there's gotta be something.

471
00:29:38,978 --> 00:29:41,211
Noah:
There really isn't anything to
do.

472
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:45,449
Rebecca:
Well, I mean,

473
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:48,318
could you give me a chance
to figure that out for myself
maybe?

474
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:51,555
Please?

475
00:29:51,557 --> 00:29:53,323
Fine.

476
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:44,107
So how long
have you lived here?

477
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:46,243
I don't know.
A long time.

478
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:49,379
I guess
you're used to it then--

479
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:51,448
the whole country thing.

480
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:54,918
No, you never really
get used to it.

481
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,987
You just sort of adapt.

482
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:03,327
I wasn't exactly thrilled
about moving here,

483
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:06,663
but it's kind of nice.

484
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,567
- Afternoon.
- Hello.

485
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:14,872
I should probably
get you home.

486
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:16,306
What?

487
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:18,475
I thought
we were having fun.

488
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:20,544
It's not that.

489
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:24,314
It's just it's getting late.
I don't want your parents
worrying.

490
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:25,816
Rebecca:
Oh, please.

491
00:31:25,818 --> 00:31:28,518
- ( tires screech )
- Noah.

492
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,355
Noah, Pastor Kingsman
is looking for you.

493
00:31:31,357 --> 00:31:33,023
Tell him I'll be there
in a few.

494
00:31:33,025 --> 00:31:35,025
He wants you now.

495
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:38,462
I've got to go home.

496
00:31:38,464 --> 00:31:40,831
Home?
You live with Pastor Kingsman?

497
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:42,266
- ( horn honks )
- Noah.

498
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:44,334
I'll explain later.

499
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:48,572
Are you gonna be okay
getting home, young lady?

500
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:51,108
Yeah, sure.

501
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,402
( footsteps )

502
00:32:18,404 --> 00:32:20,337
( knocks on door )

503
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:22,406
Kingsman: Noah.

504
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,546
( knocks on door )

505
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:33,750
Noah.

506
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:39,990
Has the choice been made?

507
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:45,429
Noah.

508
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:57,674
I know you're probably
scared right now.

509
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,611
But you can do this.

510
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:05,983
You're prepared for this.
You can do it, son.

511
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:08,485
I'm not your son.

512
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:12,489
And you have no idea
how I'm feeling right now.

513
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:19,229
You're right.

514
00:33:19,231 --> 00:33:22,099
I wouldn't pretend to know
how you're feeling.

515
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,037
But you knew
this day was coming.

516
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,741
And there can be
no mistakes-- none.

517
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:39,249
Humble yourself
before the Lord, Noah.

518
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:43,020
We are His servants.
We are here to do His will.

519
00:33:43,022 --> 00:33:46,089
We should not question
what is beyond our
understanding.

520
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,793
Put aside your weaknesses,

521
00:33:49,795 --> 00:33:52,462
and He will give you strength.

522
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:55,032
Do not get close to them--

523
00:33:55,034 --> 00:33:57,100
to any of them, to her.

524
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:06,043
Here.

525
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:11,848
Who is it?

526
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,719
The younger sister-- Mary.

527
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:22,559
( sighs )

528
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,014
- Wendy: Was it delicious?
- Dan: It was delicious.

529
00:34:44,016 --> 00:34:46,049
Christopher:
Yeah, it was delicious.

530
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:48,085
Oh, hi, honey.

531
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:50,454
Look, I left a plate for you
in the oven.

532
00:34:50,456 --> 00:34:52,489
How was your day?
Did you have fun?

533
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:55,425
Rebecca has a boyfriend.
Rebecca has a boyfriend.

534
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,127
He's not my boyfriend.

535
00:34:57,129 --> 00:34:59,329
Well, I sure hope not.
You've only known him a few
hours.

536
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:01,131
- Where's Mary?
- Wendy: She's upstairs.

537
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:03,200
She hasn't been
feeling well all day.

538
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:06,536
Oh, yeah, no problem.
Don't worry about it.

539
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:09,439
You're welcome for that plate
I left for you in the oven.

540
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:13,043
Oh, you think that's funny,
do you?

541
00:35:13,045 --> 00:35:15,112
- ( insects chirping )
- ( clock ticking )

542
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:18,181
( knocks )

543
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,351
Ooh, wow,
you look like shit.

544
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:24,187
Thanks. I feel like shit.

545
00:35:24,189 --> 00:35:26,256
How's your mouth?

546
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:28,125
Eh, it's okay.

547
00:35:28,127 --> 00:35:30,160
How was your date
with Romeo?

548
00:35:30,162 --> 00:35:33,797
Fine, until that weird
Mason guy found us

549
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:35,665
and told him to go home.

550
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,501
Guess where home is.

551
00:35:37,503 --> 00:35:39,336
He lives with Mason?

552
00:35:39,338 --> 00:35:41,138
Pastor Kingsman.

553
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,772
What?

554
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:45,375
Yeah, exactly.
It was weird.

555
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:48,078
Nice but weird.

556
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,214
Okay, why don't you start
with the nice?

557
00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:54,551
I don't think I can stomach
the weird just yet.

558
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:07,057
( birds chirping )

559
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,936
( sheep bleating )

560
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:00,837
( bleating loudly )

561
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:16,820
( gasps )

562
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,395
( birds chirping )

563
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:31,401
You do know we have
two separate rooms now, right?

564
00:39:31,403 --> 00:39:34,237
Sorry. I was just so tired.

565
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,739
I didn't feel like...

566
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:37,974
Walking all the way
down the hall.

567
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:39,609
Oh, you poor thing.

568
00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:42,245
All that flirting with that Noah
guy
must have really taken a toll on
you.

569
00:39:42,247 --> 00:39:44,914
Ha-ha.
You feeling better?

570
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:47,317
Eh, a little bit.

571
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:49,652
But I've got to get out of this
house.
So come on, get up.

572
00:39:49,654 --> 00:39:51,788
Let's go into town,
check out the boys.

573
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,623
I need a little fun.

574
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,796
- Wendy: What are you doing?
- Dan: No, no, it's good.

575
00:39:59,798 --> 00:40:02,766
Wendy: Oh, no, that doesn't look
very good at all, actually.

576
00:40:02,768 --> 00:40:05,268
- Dan: Easy now. Easy.
- Rebecca: What's with all the
cookies?

577
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:07,003
Well, they are supposed to be
for the festival,

578
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:08,538
if your dad doesn't ruin
them all.

579
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,273
Hey, easy.
I'm trying my best.

580
00:40:10,275 --> 00:40:12,575
Honey, yuck.
( chuckles )

581
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:15,979
Don't give him
all of your mistakes.

582
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:18,415
- No, no, this is not a mistake.
- He is gonna get sick.

583
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:20,049
So are you sure
you're gonna make it?

584
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:22,085
Yeah, I'm fine.
It just hurts to eat.

585
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:24,487
- Okay, but I want to get out of
here.
- I know.

586
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:28,191
- A masterpiece.
- I'm watching you. That looks--

587
00:40:28,193 --> 00:40:30,960
I'm gonna go to the park
with Pastor Kingsman.

588
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:33,062
That sounds like
a really good idea, honey.

589
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:35,432
Yeah, a pastor needs to be
with his people.

590
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:37,467
Oh, can me and Mary
go to town too?

591
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:39,302
'Cause we want to walk around
a little bit.

592
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:41,104
So nobody's gonna
help me out at all?

593
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:43,373
- No.
- No.

594
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:44,808
Fine.
Take your brother.

595
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:47,043
And get him something
other than a cookie to eat.

596
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:49,712
All right, come on then.
Let's go.

597
00:40:49,714 --> 00:40:52,415
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

598
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:55,351
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Out of here. Out of here.

599
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:10,467
All right, you girls,
make yourself useful.

600
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:12,936
- Help people out.
- Okay, Dad.

601
00:41:12,938 --> 00:41:15,004
- Woman: Hello.
- Hello.

602
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:16,706
- Hello, Pastor.
- How are you?

603
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:18,908
- Dan: Nice to see you.
- Woman: Hello to you too.

604
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,977
- Want to help her out?
- Christopher: Hi.

605
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:33,189
Mary:
Hmm.

606
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:38,228
Okay. Not bad.
He's kind of cute.

607
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:40,430
10 seconds.

608
00:41:40,432 --> 00:41:42,899
It took you 10 seconds
to find your mark.

609
00:41:42,901 --> 00:41:44,634
It's a gift.

610
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:48,037
- ( balloon squeaks )
- ( gas hissing )

611
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,208
( girls whispering )

612
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:56,179
Hi.

613
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:59,115
What are you doing?

614
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:01,851
Well, I'm Mary

615
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:04,654
and this is
my sister Rebecca.

616
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:08,324
- Smooth.
- Shut up.

617
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:10,260
( hissing )

618
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,598
So have you
lived here long?

619
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:35,518
- Hi.
- Hey.

620
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,554
Why are we hiding?

621
00:42:37,556 --> 00:42:40,156
We're not hiding.

622
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:42,525
- Well, maybe a little bit.
- ( both chuckle )

623
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:44,894
You want
to get out of here?

624
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:47,463
Actually, there's something
I'd like to show you.

625
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:51,367
- Right now?
- Yeah. Is that cool?

626
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,538
Yeah, sure.
Let me just go tell Mary.

627
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,606
Okay.

628
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:02,812
What, is that
your kissing both?

629
00:43:02,814 --> 00:43:05,114
- No.
- He's really cute.

630
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:07,383
Um, I think
he just asked me out.

631
00:43:07,385 --> 00:43:08,518
Nice.

632
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,553
Can you cover for me?

633
00:43:10,555 --> 00:43:13,423
Well, I can,
but it's gonna cost you.

634
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:16,926
All right, fine. At least one
of us is doing all right.

635
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:18,995
All right, thanks.

636
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:24,500
- Hey.
- Hey.

637
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:57,066
( water running )

638
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,537
( wings flapping )

639
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,580
Noah:
Is it weird?

640
00:44:10,582 --> 00:44:12,615
Rebecca:
Is what weird?

641
00:44:12,617 --> 00:44:14,651
Noah:
Moving away from it all,

642
00:44:14,653 --> 00:44:16,719
away from your home.

643
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:19,222
Rebecca:
My parents seem really happy.

644
00:44:19,224 --> 00:44:21,724
I think they were tired
of the city.

645
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,695
Noah:
What about you?

646
00:44:25,697 --> 00:44:28,197
Rebecca:
Me? I'm fine, I guess.

647
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:31,034
I mean, it's different,
but it's okay.

648
00:44:31,036 --> 00:44:33,603
Noah:
Just okay, huh?

649
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:36,606
Rebecca:
So where are we going?

650
00:44:36,608 --> 00:44:39,275
- Noah: You'll see.
- ( Rebecca chuckles ) Okay.

651
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:47,517
So you brought me
all the way out here

652
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:49,252
to show me
an old rusty tower?

653
00:44:49,254 --> 00:44:53,089
This is so much more
than an old rusty tower.

654
00:44:53,091 --> 00:44:54,357
Really?

655
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:58,461
- Yeah, really.
- ( chuckles )

656
00:44:58,463 --> 00:45:00,897
I want to show it to you,
but if you're scared...

657
00:45:00,899 --> 00:45:03,366
Oh, you think that rickety old
ladder
that climbs, what,

658
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:05,835
100 feet in the air
is too scary for me?

659
00:45:05,837 --> 00:45:07,937
Please.

660
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:14,077
Rebecca:
Come on.

661
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,145
What, are you chicken?

662
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:21,818
Rebecca:
Come on.

663
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:42,338
( wind whistling )

664
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,207
( metal creaking )

665
00:45:44,209 --> 00:45:46,275
Rebecca:
Oh, my God.

666
00:45:46,277 --> 00:45:48,344
This is beautiful.

667
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:51,414
I told you.

668
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:55,451
This is where I come when I want
to get away from everything.

669
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:59,922
It's kind of special to me.

670
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:02,158
Well, you weren't kidding.

671
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,227
It's amazing.

672
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:07,964
Noah: And you can see
everything from up here.

673
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:11,768
Makes you feel like
there is a world beyond here.

674
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:15,638
Rebecca:
There is a world beyond here.

675
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,907
You know what I mean.

676
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:32,822
Thank you, Noah.

677
00:46:32,824 --> 00:46:34,857
For what?

678
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:37,360
For taking me here.

679
00:46:37,362 --> 00:46:39,796
I can see
why it's so special to you.

680
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:43,065
I'm just glad you like it.

681
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:55,878
So are you gonna stay
here in town?

682
00:46:57,247 --> 00:46:59,282
What do you mean?
I live here.

683
00:46:59,284 --> 00:47:02,752
No, I know you live here,
but I just thought

684
00:47:02,754 --> 00:47:04,854
since your dad's retiring
and everything, maybe you--

685
00:47:04,856 --> 00:47:06,589
My dad?

686
00:47:06,591 --> 00:47:08,624
Pastor Kingsman.

687
00:47:08,626 --> 00:47:11,060
Kingsman's not my dad.

688
00:47:11,062 --> 00:47:13,095
He's not your dad?

689
00:47:13,097 --> 00:47:16,365
But you live with him.

690
00:47:16,367 --> 00:47:18,401
Sorry.
It's none of my business.

691
00:47:18,403 --> 00:47:20,469
No, it's fine.

692
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:26,042
When I lost my family,

693
00:47:26,044 --> 00:47:28,878
Kingsman took me in.

694
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,748
He's strict,
but he's a good guy.

695
00:47:36,086 --> 00:47:39,088
I get the feeling
he doesn't want us hanging out.

696
00:47:40,724 --> 00:47:42,792
Why would you say that?

697
00:47:42,794 --> 00:47:44,827
Well, that whole thing
with Mason

698
00:47:44,829 --> 00:47:46,863
was a little weird yesterday.

699
00:47:46,865 --> 00:47:49,632
And us hiding
from him today--

700
00:47:49,634 --> 00:47:51,667
I just-- I feel like
he doesn't like me.

701
00:47:51,669 --> 00:47:53,936
It's not that.

702
00:47:53,938 --> 00:47:56,472
He's just being protective.

703
00:47:56,474 --> 00:47:59,942
He's not so keen
on the whole dating thing.

704
00:47:59,944 --> 00:48:01,811
Oh.

705
00:48:01,813 --> 00:48:03,880
So this is a date?

706
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:06,883
I-- I--

707
00:48:06,885 --> 00:48:08,951
I'm just kidding.

708
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:30,873
Who is that?

709
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:32,541
What?

710
00:48:32,543 --> 00:48:34,377
There's a guy down there
watching us.

711
00:48:34,379 --> 00:48:35,645
Where?

712
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,317
We should go.

713
00:48:41,319 --> 00:48:42,885
Why? Who is it?

714
00:48:42,887 --> 00:48:46,255
I don't know. We should just go.
We shouldn't be up here.

715
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,648
( door creaking )

716
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:25,962
Did you think
I wouldn't find out?

717
00:49:25,964 --> 00:49:29,532
You were gonna betray us-- all
of us.
I will not let that happen.

718
00:49:29,534 --> 00:49:31,133
So I just have to put up
with this shit?

719
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,569
My God, Noah, you've seen it.
You know what it's capable of.

720
00:49:33,571 --> 00:49:35,237
Why can't we stop it?

721
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:37,340
It is God's will.
We are His servants.

722
00:49:37,342 --> 00:49:38,908
We must do
everything we can--

723
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:41,043
You're a fucking liar.

724
00:49:41,045 --> 00:49:43,012
Stop being such a child!

725
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:47,650
Yes, we've been lied to.
Yes, we've been told stories--

726
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:50,152
stories of angels
that will come down from heaven

727
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:52,955
and slay the demons and send
them to hell and protect us all.

728
00:49:52,957 --> 00:49:55,791
There are no angels!
There is only us.

729
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:00,930
You know what needs to be done.
And I need to know you'll do it.

730
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:04,233
There is no other way.

731
00:50:08,372 --> 00:50:11,207
I just wish there was something
I could do to save them.

732
00:50:11,209 --> 00:50:13,275
Do your part.

733
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:23,085
( laughing, chattering )

734
00:50:23,087 --> 00:50:24,887
Wendy:
Oh, goodness. Hello.

735
00:50:24,889 --> 00:50:26,956
Mom, I'm gonna
head off, okay?

736
00:50:26,958 --> 00:50:29,091
Oh, you like that,
don't you?

737
00:50:29,093 --> 00:50:32,028
All right, well, you can go play
with the other kids.

738
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:34,063
- Okay, Mom.
- Don't go too far.

739
00:50:34,065 --> 00:50:36,665
Dan:
Check in with us.

740
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:38,701
Wendy:
Mm-hmm.

741
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:40,970
I think we should do this
in the backyard.

742
00:50:40,972 --> 00:50:43,005
Hello. How are you?

743
00:50:43,007 --> 00:50:45,107
We're neighbors.
It's so nice to meet you.

744
00:50:45,109 --> 00:50:47,309
- Wendy: Hello.
- Dan: Hi. Nice to see you.

745
00:50:47,311 --> 00:50:49,478
Wendy:
Well, aren't you handsome.

746
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,381
- Dan: Hi.
- Wendy: Hi there. Hi.

747
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:54,016
( all chattering )

748
00:50:54,018 --> 00:50:56,886
- ( bell dings )
- Yeah, I got it. I got it.

749
00:50:56,888 --> 00:50:59,588
Woman:
You did it. Awesome.

750
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:02,391
Would you like some popcorn?

751
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:17,339
Crowd: Ooh!

752
00:51:17,341 --> 00:51:19,208
Dan:
Was that you?

753
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:21,544
Christopher: Dad, you should
try.
Come on.

754
00:51:21,546 --> 00:51:23,612
Let's get out of here.

755
00:51:23,614 --> 00:51:24,680
( chattering )

756
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,255
- Christopher: Dad, please.
- You do it. Let him put you...

757
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:35,057
- In the tank?
- Come on, come on, come on.

758
00:51:35,059 --> 00:51:36,459
- Oh, really?
- Come on, come on.

759
00:51:36,461 --> 00:51:38,561
- Mary: So do you see him
anywhere?
- Rebecca: Who?

760
00:51:38,563 --> 00:51:40,896
Oh, don't even.
You know who. Noah.

761
00:51:40,898 --> 00:51:43,933
No, but he said he was coming,
so I'm not worried.

762
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:54,677
So what do you guys think?

763
00:51:54,679 --> 00:51:57,079
Well, it's not totally lame.

764
00:51:57,081 --> 00:51:59,548
( chuckles )
Yeah.

765
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:03,285
Um, are there some cool games
or something?

766
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:06,055
Yes, sure. Come on.

767
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:09,391
Mary: All right,
let's see what you got.

768
00:52:09,393 --> 00:52:11,527
- ( Rebecca laughs )
- Nice. That was not even close.

769
00:52:11,529 --> 00:52:13,662
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

770
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:17,533
Mary: Nice.

771
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:20,336
Oh, you guys
really suck at this.

772
00:52:20,338 --> 00:52:22,738
Shut up, Noah.
You're taking all the fun out of
it.

773
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:26,208
And aren't you the one that's
supposed to be winning us a
prize?

774
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:29,211
- Maybe he just can't throw a
ball.
- Well, that's true.

775
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:34,483
- Let me show you something.
- Oh, excuse me.

776
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:38,020
- Oh.
- Holy shit.

777
00:52:38,022 --> 00:52:40,756
Maybe-- maybe he can.
I don't know.

778
00:52:40,758 --> 00:52:42,424
Man:
Let's just take a seat.

779
00:52:42,426 --> 00:52:44,326
- I'm good. Thank you though.
- No? No?

780
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:46,729
- Mary: I'm also good.
- Noah: Thanks.

781
00:52:46,731 --> 00:52:49,198
- Cute.
- ( bell dings )

782
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:04,046
Rebecca:
Let's see what you got, Mary.

783
00:53:04,048 --> 00:53:05,514
Oh, I'm not--
I can't follow that.

784
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:07,816
I'm kind of thirsty. You guys
want
to grab something to drink?

785
00:53:07,818 --> 00:53:10,319
Oh, that sounds good. I want one
of those pies I keep seeing
around.

786
00:53:10,321 --> 00:53:12,454
- Of course you do.
- Shut up.

787
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,363
Mary: Do you see them?
They look so happy.

788
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:24,200
- They just fit right in here.
- I know. It's kind of perfect.

789
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:29,572
Man:
Thank you.

790
00:53:29,574 --> 00:53:32,208
- So what can I get for you
kids?
- Do you have pie here?

791
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:33,576
- We sure do.
- Mary: Can I have one?

792
00:53:33,578 --> 00:53:35,177
What about you?
What would you like?

793
00:53:35,179 --> 00:53:37,012
You? Anything to drink?

794
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:42,651
We'll have three
lemonades, please.

795
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:46,255
All right, well,
I guess I'm having lemonade.

Wendy:
Who was that?

926
01:03:31,408 --> 01:03:33,742
I have to go to the church.

What, now? What for?

928

I don't know.

929
01:03:38,582 --> 01:03:40,882
Kingsman said
that he needed me.

Wendy: At this hour?
You can't go now.

931
01:03:44,021 --> 01:03:46,054
He knows
your daughter's sick.

932
01:03:46,056 --> 01:03:48,089
Yeah, he said
that it was important.

933
01:03:48,091 --> 01:03:50,058
- Honey, I don't--
- How is she?

934
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:51,893
She's not well.
She's sweating a lot.

935
01:03:51,895 --> 01:03:53,762
She doesn't have a fever.
I don't know what it is.

Are you okay?

945
01:05:13,377 --> 01:05:15,877
I had to get you away
from there.

946
01:05:15,879 --> 01:05:19,147
It needs time.

947
01:05:19,149 --> 01:05:21,383
Not much,
but it needs time.

948
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:26,955
Dan: I'm afraid
that I'm not following.

949
01:05:26,957 --> 01:05:28,857
I don't know
what needs time

950
01:05:28,859 --> 01:05:30,759
and what I'm supposed
to get away from.

951
01:05:30,761 --> 01:05:33,128
Yes, Dan, you are.
You are following.

Oh, your poor daughter.
She is so young.

958

What-- what are you
talking about?

959
01:05:59,156 --> 01:06:02,724
God give us strength
to do what must be done.

- Christopher: Mary, no!
- ( tires screeching )

1113
01:18:35,844 --> 01:18:38,279
Stop the car.

1114
01:18:38,281 --> 01:18:40,514
We can't.

1115
01:18:40,516 --> 01:18:42,850
Stop the car now.

1116
01:18:42,852 --> 01:18:44,485
That's not your sister.

1117
01:18:44,487 --> 01:18:47,288
Stop the fucking car now.

1118
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:50,057
- ( tires screech )
- Why are you stopping?

1119
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:52,860
Don't stop.
Keep going.

1120
01:18:56,531 --> 01:18:58,399
- Noah: Rebecca.
- ( car door slams )

1121
01:18:58,401 --> 01:19:00,601
Listen to me.
She's not your sister anymore.

1122
01:19:00,603 --> 01:19:02,203
What the hell
does that mean?

1123
01:19:02,205 --> 01:19:03,904
What does that mean, Noah?
What's going on?

1124
01:19:03,906 --> 01:19:06,173
Christopher:
Get in the car.

1125
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:14,148
Get in the car.

1126
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:16,083
Please get back in the car.

1127
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:18,886
I'll tell you what I know, but
you
have to get back in the car
right now.

1128
01:19:18,888 --> 01:19:20,921
What?
You're part of this?

1129
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:22,957
Oh, my God,
you're part of this?

1130
01:19:22,959 --> 01:19:25,693
Rebecca, please
get in the fucking car!

1131
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:27,895
You were chosen.

1132
01:19:27,897 --> 01:19:29,764
Chosen?

1133
01:19:29,766 --> 01:19:31,899
Yes. You, your whole family.

1134
01:19:31,901 --> 01:19:33,534
You were chosen.
We all were.

1135
01:19:33,536 --> 01:19:35,803
I don't understand.

1136
01:19:35,805 --> 01:19:37,238
We aren't meant to.

1137
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:39,740
My whole family was brought here
just like yours.

1138
01:19:39,742 --> 01:19:42,710
You come here and you think
it's fucking perfect,

1139
01:19:42,712 --> 01:19:44,578
and then you're fucked--
you, your whole family.

1140
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:45,780
That's just what happens.

1141
01:19:45,782 --> 01:19:47,515
If they even knew I was
telling you any of this--

1142
01:19:47,517 --> 01:19:49,550
Who is they?
Pastor Kingsman?

1143
01:19:49,552 --> 01:19:50,718
Kingsman is just the keeper.

1144
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:52,553
He is just doing
what he was asked to do.

1145
01:19:52,555 --> 01:19:56,590
This place is a doorway,
and on the other side is evil.

1146
01:19:56,592 --> 01:19:58,425
We were picked to be a part
of this great, big plan

1147
01:19:58,427 --> 01:19:59,760
that we have no control over.

1148
01:19:59,762 --> 01:20:01,562
All I know is that once
the doorway is open,

1149
01:20:01,564 --> 01:20:04,031
we have one job,
and one job only-- to shut it.

1150
01:20:05,734 --> 01:20:07,968
I'm sorry.
I'm trying to save you.

1151
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:10,204
Please trust me.
You have to get back in the car

1152
01:20:10,206 --> 01:20:12,439
and we have to go right now.

1153
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:17,144
( gasps )

1154
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:19,213
Get in the car!

1155
01:20:27,355 --> 01:20:29,423
- Christopher!

1156

What are you doing?

1159
01:20:37,567 --> 01:20:39,300
Christopher!

1160
01:20:40,235 --> 01:20:42,570
No! She's coming,
Christopher!

1161
01:20:55,217 --> 01:20:58,519
Help! Help!
Let me in!

1162
01:20:58,521 --> 01:21:00,888
Help! Help!

1163
01:21:00,890 --> 01:21:03,224
Please.

1164
01:21:03,226 --> 01:21:05,259
Help!

1165
01:21:05,261 --> 01:21:07,328
Please let me in!

1166
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:14,401
Help!

1167
01:21:21,109 --> 01:21:23,944
Help! Help, please!

1168
01:21:23,946 --> 01:21:25,880
Please help!

1169

Rebecca:
What are we gonna do?

1174
01:22:17,299 --> 01:22:19,366
Noah:
Just keep looking.

1175
01:22:28,176 --> 01:22:29,977
Oh, God.

1176
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:33,747
There she-- there she is!

1177
01:22:37,819 --> 01:22:39,386
Noah:
Christopher is inside.

1178
01:22:39,388 --> 01:22:41,689
Rebecca:
Oh, my God.

1179
01:22:41,691 --> 01:22:44,491
Is he gonna be safe
in there?

1180
01:22:44,493 --> 01:22:47,995
I'm sorry,
but you can't stay here.

1181
01:22:47,997 --> 01:22:50,064
Please.

1182
01:22:53,234 --> 01:22:55,302
Why?

1183
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:56,971
Why won't you help me?

1184
01:23:03,945 --> 01:23:05,813
Why won't you help me?

1185
01:23:08,583 --> 01:23:11,051
I'm sorry,
but you have to leave.

1186
01:23:11,053 --> 01:23:13,587
- Please. No. No!
- I'm sorry, but you have to
leave.

1187

- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Please. Please.

Please, no, don't do this!

1191

- I'm sorry.
- You can't put me out there!

Chris, I'm sorry.
Come on.

1196

It's okay. It's okay.
We're gonna be okay.

1202

You're safe now.
You're safe.

1203

Where the hell
are you going?

1204
01:24:58,094 --> 01:25:00,127
Noah: We have to stop
the bleeding.

- Leave the car running.
- What?

1209

I have to keep you safe.

He's doing what God
has asked us to do.

We must close the gate
and end this,

or else darkness
will subdue the light

will become his.
