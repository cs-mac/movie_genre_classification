1
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:02,510
You must declare all items.

2
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,741
Undeclared items will be confiscated.

3
00:01:04,816 --> 00:01:06,977
Cho, declare the ginseng to customs.

4
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:10,077
Why, Pop? They make us pay 50 bucks in
duty.

5
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:12,054
I know.

6
00:01:12,123 --> 00:01:13,522
- What if I just hide it in my
pants?

7
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:14,956
They'll never know.

8
00:01:15,026 --> 00:01:16,618
- Brilliant, Fei-
Hong.

9
00:01:16,694 --> 00:01:18,025
Better yet, why don't we have the master
hold onto it?

10
00:01:18,096 --> 00:01:19,028
They'll never search him,

11
00:01:19,097 --> 00:01:20,029
because he's
too respectable.

12
00:01:20,098 --> 00:01:21,030
What do you think?

13
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:22,157
- Ha ha ha! Very
good idea.

14
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:23,427
You're hopeless... both of you.

15
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:24,832
- Bad
idea.

16
00:01:24,903 --> 00:01:26,894
I'll not hear any more of your nonsense.

17
00:01:26,971 --> 00:01:27,938
I just don't understand

18
00:01:28,006 --> 00:01:28,938
why we have to pay duties-

19
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:30,269
on everything we buy?

20
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:32,400
I don't care what you say. Just listen
to me.

21
00:01:32,477 --> 00:01:34,308
Avoid trouble. Pay the duties, that's it.

22
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:35,311
I know best.

23
00:01:41,386 --> 00:01:42,444
Soldier: Back, back.

24
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,717
Back. Make way. Let the ambassador
through.

25
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,985
What's going on?

26
00:01:48,059 --> 00:01:49,083
Now watch it.

27
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,184
It's the ambassador,

28
00:01:50,261 --> 00:01:51,694
and he deserves respect.

29
00:01:51,763 --> 00:01:53,162
He's treated like royalty.

30
00:01:53,231 --> 00:01:54,596
He doesn't have to pay any duties.

31
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:55,963
How about that one?

32
00:01:56,034 --> 00:01:57,467
Wow. He's a lucky one.

33
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,106
No pushing. Don't push.

34
00:02:05,176 --> 00:02:06,643
Everybody back.

35
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:08,008
Let these people through!

36
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:09,569
Ay!

37
00:02:10,715 --> 00:02:13,115
Oh, no. Hey, are you all right?

38
00:02:13,184 --> 00:02:14,742
Let's go. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

39
00:02:16,754 --> 00:02:18,585
What happened?

40
00:02:18,656 --> 00:02:19,714
Shut up. Someone push him.

41
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:20,780
Huh?

42
00:02:20,858 --> 00:02:22,485
Please, sir, I apologise.

43
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,584
Listen, Fei-Hong.

44
00:02:23,661 --> 00:02:25,390
Fei-Hong, why did you give him our ginseng?

45
00:02:25,463 --> 00:02:26,555
So we don't have to pay tax.

46
00:02:26,631 --> 00:02:28,258
Once we get on the train, I'll look for the box.

47
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:29,766
Ah, what a terrific idea.

48
00:02:29,834 --> 00:02:30,766
What's that?

49
00:02:30,835 --> 00:02:31,767
You could throw me down again

50
00:02:31,836 --> 00:02:32,825
and I'll hide some more.

51
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:33,836
Here I go. Here I go.

52
00:02:33,905 --> 00:02:34,929
Aah!

53
00:02:35,006 --> 00:02:36,439
Ooh.

54
00:02:37,742 --> 00:02:38,674
He must've tripped.

55
00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:39,675
Look atyou.
You're so clumsy.

56
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,837
Come on, get up.

57
00:02:41,913 --> 00:02:42,937
File in!

58
00:02:47,385 --> 00:02:48,852
Wow, what a crowd.

59
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,887
Why don't you go get a seat-

60
00:02:49,954 --> 00:02:51,012
and I'll pay the taxes?

61
00:02:51,089 --> 00:02:52,147
All right, son.

62
00:02:52,223 --> 00:02:53,588
I'll see you on board.

63
00:02:53,658 --> 00:02:55,421
If you have nothing to declare,

64
00:02:55,493 --> 00:02:57,120
begin boarding right now.

65
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:06,930
Here, Fei-Hong, take this.

66
00:03:07,005 --> 00:03:07,937
Got it.

67
00:03:10,008 --> 00:03:11,441
Come on.

68
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:15,372
Fei-Hong, great.

69
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:18,749
Easy, easy.

70
00:03:18,816 --> 00:03:19,874
Be careful. You'll crush everything.

71
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:21,213
That's good.

72
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:22,718
Hold it.

73
00:03:24,122 --> 00:03:25,749
Hey, where are you going? Stop!

74
00:03:25,823 --> 00:03:27,620
Come back! Fei-Hong!

75
00:03:29,661 --> 00:03:31,720
Fei-Hong, let him go!

76
00:03:33,698 --> 00:03:35,256
Fei-Hong, forget about him!

77
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,528
Come back here. Come back.

78
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:40,668
Fei-Hong,

79
00:03:40,738 --> 00:03:42,433
now, let me remind you.

80
00:03:42,507 --> 00:03:44,873
A hero lives but a few seconds.

81
00:03:44,942 --> 00:03:46,307
A master holds onto his life.

82
00:03:46,377 --> 00:03:47,640
But he stole your wallet.

83
00:03:47,773 --> 00:03:49,536
And I took it back.

84
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:50,701
That's not the issue.

85
00:03:50,776 --> 00:03:52,403
The point is, the stronger man knows...

86
00:03:52,478 --> 00:03:55,038
It's more important to forgive than it
is to fight.

87
00:03:55,114 --> 00:03:56,046
That's right.

88
00:03:56,115 --> 00:03:57,275
What was I thinking?

89
00:04:18,027 --> 00:04:18,959
Uhh.

90
00:04:19,028 --> 00:04:20,393
Your turn.

91
00:04:20,463 --> 00:04:21,794
How about this?

92
00:04:21,864 --> 00:04:25,231
Hey, you know better than that.

93
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:28,498
But there's no other move.

94
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:30,835
Try it again.

95
00:04:30,907 --> 00:04:32,807
Try it again.

96
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,036
Hey, look at the white crane.

97
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:37,443
Wow. Have you ever seen one like that?

98
00:04:37,513 --> 00:04:40,175
It's still your play.

99
00:04:40,249 --> 00:04:41,477
Come on.

100
00:04:41,551 --> 00:04:44,042
Can we start over?

101
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,280
You still have a chance.

102
00:04:45,355 --> 00:04:46,686
Where? I don't see it.

103
00:04:46,756 --> 00:04:48,815
It's not fair. You always win.

104
00:04:48,891 --> 00:04:50,449
Ready?

105
00:04:50,526 --> 00:04:51,823
Oh, God!

106
00:04:51,894 --> 00:04:54,294
Damn it!

107
00:04:57,467 --> 00:04:58,456
Uhh...

108
00:04:58,534 --> 00:05:00,365
Are you OK?

109
00:05:00,436 --> 00:05:01,300
Oh...

110
00:05:01,371 --> 00:05:03,396
I bet that hurt.

111
00:05:03,473 --> 00:05:04,735
I'm sorry, sir.

112
00:05:04,807 --> 00:05:06,570
Is this yours? - I'm afraid so.

113
00:05:06,642 --> 00:05:08,303
Be more careful.

114
00:05:08,378 --> 00:05:09,709
Shh.

115
00:05:10,813 --> 00:05:12,246
Yes, sir.

116
00:05:12,315 --> 00:05:13,247
Ready?

117
00:05:13,316 --> 00:05:14,578
Ready.

118
00:05:16,252 --> 00:05:18,820
Fei-Hong, what's this?

119
00:05:18,953 --> 00:05:20,784
We call it cheating.

120
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:41,437
You've only got 10 minutes, so hurry up.

121
00:05:51,574 --> 00:05:54,065
Come on, we ain't got all day!

122
00:05:55,644 --> 00:05:57,202
Oh, the ginseng... time to find it.

123
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,507
Oh, yeah. Good idea.

124
00:05:58,581 --> 00:06:00,173
Father, forget about this.

125
00:06:00,249 --> 00:06:01,876
Let me go find something you're really
going to like.

126
00:06:01,951 --> 00:06:04,579
Ha ha. I don't think I'm ready to eat,

127
00:06:04,653 --> 00:06:05,642
but I thank you.

128
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:07,348
Come on, how about a nice roasted
chicken?

129
00:06:07,423 --> 00:06:08,355
We can find him one.

130
00:06:08,424 --> 00:06:09,584
How about it, huh?

131
00:06:09,658 --> 00:06:11,353
Look, I can see you two want to look
around a bit.

132
00:06:11,427 --> 00:06:12,826
It's OK. I'll be fine here.

133
00:06:12,895 --> 00:06:13,919
Go on. - Come on.

134
00:06:16,232 --> 00:06:17,324
Hey-

135
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:19,765
you two stay out of trouble, you hear me?

136
00:06:19,835 --> 00:06:21,097
You make sure you come right back.

137
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:24,963
Pardon me.

138
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,200
Excuse me.

139
00:06:26,275 --> 00:06:27,708
Pardon me.

140
00:06:30,713 --> 00:06:31,680
Sorry, sorry.

141
00:06:37,086 --> 00:06:38,610
God, do you believe the smell of this
place?

142
00:06:38,687 --> 00:06:41,121
I think I'm going to be sick.

143
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,521
God.

144
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:44,525
Hey, this way.

145
00:06:48,931 --> 00:06:49,863
Wow.

146
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,167
The vegetation's much nicer.

147
00:06:53,235 --> 00:06:54,759
Yes, I see.

148
00:06:55,938 --> 00:06:57,166
It's making me hungry.

149
00:06:57,239 --> 00:06:59,104
Maybe we could grab a roll.

150
00:06:59,174 --> 00:07:00,402
Hey!

151
00:07:02,411 --> 00:07:03,969
What are you doing here?

152
00:07:04,046 --> 00:07:05,172
Nothing. - Nothing.

153
00:07:05,247 --> 00:07:06,305
You think you have reservations?

154
00:07:06,382 --> 00:07:07,781
Yeah, yeah, we do.

155
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:08,782
Go on back.

156
00:07:08,851 --> 00:07:09,783
Check inside.

157
00:07:09,852 --> 00:07:10,819
I've had enough. Go on.

158
00:07:10,886 --> 00:07:13,719
One more time, and you're off the train.

159
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:14,915
So what do we do now?

160
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:15,922
I got an idea.

161
00:07:28,237 --> 00:07:29,169
Now what?

162
00:07:29,238 --> 00:07:30,466
Just watch me.

163
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:34,835
Go!

164
00:07:36,712 --> 00:07:38,839
Go away! Go away!

165
00:07:38,914 --> 00:07:40,609
Look out!

166
00:07:40,683 --> 00:07:41,650
They've gone wild!

167
00:07:46,722 --> 00:07:48,587
Here. Hold this.

168
00:07:48,657 --> 00:07:50,124
Stop him!

169
00:07:52,094 --> 00:07:54,119
Fire! Fire!

170
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:58,860
Aah!

171
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,176
Sorry, sir. Huh?

172
00:08:08,243 --> 00:08:09,175
Wait.

173
00:08:11,981 --> 00:08:13,278
Hey!

174
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:15,874
He...

175
00:08:20,422 --> 00:08:23,357
I'm sure he came this way.

176
00:08:26,228 --> 00:08:28,162
Hey, stop!

177
00:08:35,504 --> 00:08:37,404
Hey, you!

178
00:08:37,473 --> 00:08:39,464
Where you going? - Where you
going?

179
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,031
Hey, you.

180
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,305
Wait. Why you hit...

181
00:08:47,549 --> 00:08:48,709
I kill you! - Oh!

182
00:08:52,488 --> 00:08:53,978
There. Traitor.

183
00:08:54,056 --> 00:08:55,489
A what?

184
00:08:58,427 --> 00:08:59,359
Hot tea, sir?

185
00:09:01,463 --> 00:09:03,192
Hot tea for sale.

186
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:05,266
Thank you.

187
00:09:11,407 --> 00:09:13,204
You leave me alone!

188
00:09:36,498 --> 00:09:37,590
Yaah!

189
00:09:58,087 --> 00:10:00,078
Next time, I cut your throat...

190
00:10:01,557 --> 00:10:03,024
Traitor.

191
00:10:06,795 --> 00:10:08,023
You.

192
00:10:09,431 --> 00:10:10,796
Hey, listen!

193
00:10:12,668 --> 00:10:14,636
I'm not a traitor, you hear me? You...

194
00:10:16,538 --> 00:10:17,835
Then what are we fighting about?

195
00:10:17,906 --> 00:10:19,897
Don't play games. You hit me.

196
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:30,813
Yaah!

197
00:10:59,081 --> 00:11:00,275
Where'd he go?

198
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,479
Hey!

199
00:11:14,696 --> 00:11:15,822
Hmm.

200
00:11:22,538 --> 00:11:24,870
Back again? Why don't you give up?

201
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,703
Oh, no, old man. Apologise.

202
00:11:26,775 --> 00:11:28,140
What did you say?

203
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,041
How dare you call me a traitor?

204
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,204
OK. Sorry.

205
00:11:33,282 --> 00:11:34,977
Fine, but I still owe you one.

206
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,449
Here.

207
00:11:36,518 --> 00:11:37,883
Hey, show respect.

208
00:11:37,953 --> 00:11:39,113
Stand still.

209
00:11:39,188 --> 00:11:40,246
Respect to you?

210
00:11:40,322 --> 00:11:43,257
You must be kidding me.

211
00:11:46,929 --> 00:11:48,556
Let's make this fair.

212
00:11:52,801 --> 00:11:53,733
Huhh.

213
00:11:53,802 --> 00:11:55,269
Ready?

214
00:12:12,154 --> 00:12:14,213
Ah, drunken boxing.

215
00:12:15,757 --> 00:12:18,225
That's right. I'm the master.

216
00:12:19,661 --> 00:12:20,821
You think so?

217
00:12:20,896 --> 00:12:21,828
Again.

218
00:12:23,732 --> 00:12:24,664
Come on.

219
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:26,724
Let's go. - You come.

220
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,528
You know-

221
00:12:29,605 --> 00:12:31,800
a kid like you isn't worth my time.

222
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,133
I show you!

223
00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:36,040
Tiger Slash At Bear!

224
00:12:39,348 --> 00:12:40,315
Quail!

225
00:12:41,617 --> 00:12:42,606
Huh?

226
00:12:46,288 --> 00:12:47,812
What do you call that one?

227
00:12:50,058 --> 00:12:52,458
Ha. It's called Turtle Holding Wild Bear.

228
00:12:54,196 --> 00:12:55,857
Catch the Bouquet!

229
00:12:55,931 --> 00:12:57,899
Eagle Catch the Rabbit!

230
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:03,136
Down the Hatch!

231
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,504
Hmm. - Drunk Plays the Flute?

232
00:13:07,576 --> 00:13:09,669
* Da da da da da da da *

233
00:13:09,745 --> 00:13:12,009
Fei-Hong::
**Lala la la la la la**

234
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,843
**Deela da da
la la la la la la--**

235
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,611
Uhh.

236
00:13:15,684 --> 00:13:16,742
And this one?

237
00:13:18,987 --> 00:13:20,545
Nursing a Hangover.

238
00:13:20,622 --> 00:13:22,613
OK-

239
00:13:22,691 --> 00:13:23,817
stand up.

240
00:13:29,364 --> 00:13:30,695
Your kung fu is pretty good.

241
00:13:30,766 --> 00:13:33,064
Young man, you're not too bad yourself,

242
00:13:33,135 --> 00:13:34,261
but that drunken boxing wasn't...

243
00:13:35,337 --> 00:13:36,964
Impressed?

244
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:39,974
Basically, it's slow, and you have no
power.

245
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:41,703
It's pathetic.

246
00:13:41,777 --> 00:13:43,711
What?

247
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:46,577
I can defeat any kung fu. I show you
power.

248
00:13:46,648 --> 00:13:48,809
That's nice, but you're out of time.

249
00:13:48,884 --> 00:13:50,249
Time? I'm young and strong.

250
00:13:50,319 --> 00:13:51,251
I've got lots of time.

251
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,811
But your train's leaving over there.

252
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:56,449
Nice try, old man, but now you're going
to get it.

253
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,186
Ay. All right, kid.

254
00:13:59,261 --> 00:14:00,353
Come back here!

255
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:01,599
Oh, no, the train!

256
00:14:05,837 --> 00:14:07,805
Wait for me!

257
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,641
Come on, give me your hand.

258
00:14:20,018 --> 00:14:21,542
Hey, thanks a lot.

259
00:14:21,619 --> 00:14:23,553
Get what you were after?

260
00:14:25,623 --> 00:14:27,113
Good fortune to you!

261
00:14:27,191 --> 00:14:28,658
Ah, the ginseng.

262
00:14:31,396 --> 00:14:32,328
Ah.

263
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,826
Ginseng?

264
00:14:41,973 --> 00:14:44,806
All right, everyone here get up.

265
00:14:44,876 --> 00:14:47,310
Gather your luggage for inspection.

266
00:14:47,378 --> 00:14:49,846
Everyone, now. Come on.

267
00:14:51,816 --> 00:14:53,044
You.

268
00:14:53,117 --> 00:14:54,641
Wake up.

269
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,981
Good morning.

270
00:14:56,054 --> 00:14:57,112
What are you doing?

271
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,588
Something has been stolen,

272
00:14:59,657 --> 00:15:00,919
and we're going to find it.

273
00:15:00,992 --> 00:15:02,687
Guard, -

274
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,692
search them.

275
00:15:03,761 --> 00:15:05,319
All right, what is all that?

276
00:15:06,497 --> 00:15:08,431
You, take it out.

277
00:15:08,499 --> 00:15:09,431
Hurry up.

278
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,128
Cho, open this. Fei-Hong.

279
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:13,170
Let me see.

280
00:15:13,237 --> 00:15:14,602
Bear claw.

281
00:15:14,672 --> 00:15:16,367
What else? Come on.

282
00:15:16,441 --> 00:15:17,533
Green toad.

283
00:15:17,608 --> 00:15:18,939
Next.

284
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:19,999
Deer horn, ginseng...

285
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:23,605
What's that? The one you dropped.

286
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:24,739
Open that.

287
00:15:24,816 --> 00:15:26,078
This one?

288
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,447
What's that?

289
00:15:27,518 --> 00:15:28,849
Dried yak.

290
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,285
OK, next. - Shit.

291
00:15:30,354 --> 00:15:31,514
Now the other box. Come on.

292
00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:32,521
Let me see the other box.

293
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,182
Acorn.

294
00:15:34,258 --> 00:15:36,249
Not that... that.

295
00:15:36,327 --> 00:15:38,693
Let me see that one.

296
00:15:38,763 --> 00:15:40,822
Not that one. The one over there.

297
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:41,956
Which one?

298
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:43,330
On the seat... between you.

299
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:44,732
This? No, no, no. That one.

300
00:15:44,802 --> 00:15:46,269
He means the ginseng.

301
00:15:46,337 --> 00:15:47,565
He wasn't hiding it.

302
00:15:47,638 --> 00:15:49,299
Well, then open it up.

303
00:15:49,373 --> 00:15:51,136
What are you waiting for?

304
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:52,141
Open that box!

305
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,142
Right now!

306
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:54,371
Excuse me, sir-

307
00:15:54,445 --> 00:15:57,039
these gentlemen are clearly physicians
from Hunan.

308
00:15:57,115 --> 00:15:59,015
Why don't you give them a break, huh?

309
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,051
I don't give breaks. I give orders.

310
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:02,677
Show me your papers.

311
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,244
Come on, let's see them.

312
00:16:04,322 --> 00:16:05,254
Here.

313
00:16:07,825 --> 00:16:09,986
Sir, my apologies.

314
00:16:12,563 --> 00:16:13,791
Shh.

315
00:16:13,865 --> 00:16:14,832
Sir.

316
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,197
He's with Counterintelligence.

317
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,532
He's with the central government.

318
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,402
Better not challenge his authority.

319
00:16:22,473 --> 00:16:23,599
All right, next car.

320
00:16:23,674 --> 00:16:25,301
Search up there. - Next car.

321
00:16:27,411 --> 00:16:28,901
I'm amazed they would think

322
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,242
we would steal anything.

323
00:16:30,314 --> 00:16:31,975
It is such an insult.

324
00:16:32,049 --> 00:16:32,981
Yeah.

325
00:16:34,352 --> 00:16:36,650
Put that away.

326
00:16:40,758 --> 00:16:43,784
Do you all realise what this means?

327
00:16:43,861 --> 00:16:45,829
They certainly won't buy the rest of the
shipment-

328
00:16:45,897 --> 00:16:47,364
without it.

329
00:16:49,066 --> 00:16:50,795
You know, I'm truly astounded

330
00:16:50,868 --> 00:16:53,632
at the incompetence of all of you.

331
00:16:53,704 --> 00:16:55,672
You severely damaged my reputation

332
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,731
with the British Museum of Art.

333
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:58,901
They've asked me to deliver

334
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,001
the jade seal of the emperor,

335
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:02,943
and I have every intention

336
00:17:03,014 --> 00:17:04,948
of fulfilling that request.

337
00:17:06,517 --> 00:17:09,611
I don't care how you do it.

338
00:17:09,687 --> 00:17:11,154
I want it back.

339
00:17:11,222 --> 00:17:12,280
Yes, sir.

340
00:17:12,356 --> 00:17:14,051
We think we know who the thief is, sir.

341
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,217
Get him.

342
00:17:15,293 --> 00:17:16,225
Yes, sir.

343
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,296
John-

344
00:17:19,363 --> 00:17:20,421
we're having a bit of trouble

345
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,659
with the workers at the steel factory.

346
00:17:22,733 --> 00:17:24,200
I trust you'll deal with it.

347
00:17:24,268 --> 00:17:25,257
Of course, sir.

348
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,133
I know just what to do in this situation.

349
00:17:27,205 --> 00:17:29,070
I promise you'll have no more trouble.

350
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,129
Let's make sure.

351
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,072
Yes, sir.

352
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:36,576
Uhh!

353
00:17:40,985 --> 00:17:42,452
Ancestors be blessed.

354
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,592
Ha!

355
00:17:51,896 --> 00:17:53,022
It's grand slam.

356
00:17:53,097 --> 00:17:54,121
Aw...

357
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,428
Ha ha ha!

358
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,695
Let's go, let's go. Come on, come on,
pay up, pay up.

359
00:17:58,769 --> 00:18:00,600
Quickly. We haven't got all day.

360
00:18:00,671 --> 00:18:02,161
Go and see who is at the door.

361
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,605
Come on.

362
00:18:03,674 --> 00:18:05,642
Money. Ha ha ha! That's the way.

363
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,642
More. Now your turn.

364
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,110
Come on.

365
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:11,079
She wins every turn.

366
00:18:11,148 --> 00:18:12,672
Madam?

367
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,842
The master is back.

368
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:16,318
Yeah, yeah, the master.

369
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:18,150
Oh, God, it's my husband!

370
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,221
Hi.

371
00:18:21,292 --> 00:18:22,452
Hello.

372
00:18:22,526 --> 00:18:23,993
What took you so long?

373
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,529
I was in the kitchen.

374
00:18:26,597 --> 00:18:28,121
Uhh. Unh.

375
00:18:28,199 --> 00:18:29,666
Stand back.

376
00:18:31,369 --> 00:18:32,301
Here.

377
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,638
Miss me?

378
00:18:36,707 --> 00:18:39,039
What are you all doing?

379
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:41,408
Oh, it's you. I'm so glad you're home.

380
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:42,503
How was your trip?

381
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,172
Is everything all right?

382
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,340
All right?

383
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,849
Um... oh.

384
00:18:47,985 --> 00:18:48,952
Hmm.

385
00:18:50,488 --> 00:18:51,420
More mah-jongg?

386
00:18:51,489 --> 00:18:53,480
Quiet!

387
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:55,557
How many times have I asked you

388
00:18:55,626 --> 00:18:57,321
not to see patients while I'm away?

389
00:18:57,395 --> 00:18:58,362
You know it's illegal.

390
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:01,262
Oh, now, I know I'm not supposed to,

391
00:19:01,332 --> 00:19:03,562
and I tried to wait, but I had no idea

392
00:19:03,634 --> 00:19:06,535
when you would return. Besides, if you
were me,

393
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,299
I know you would've done the same thing.

394
00:19:09,807 --> 00:19:11,604
Wow. I bet you won a lot.

395
00:19:11,676 --> 00:19:13,075
Not now.

396
00:19:14,412 --> 00:19:15,538
Perhaps I should examine them.

397
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:18,207
Uh, oh, it's a female problem.

398
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,715
I can handle it.

399
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,877
Fei-Hong, would you prepare my altar for
me?

400
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:23,215
All right.

401
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,584
You should wash your hands.

402
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,116
Stop it.

403
00:19:27,191 --> 00:19:30,319
We'll need the altar ladder over here,
please.

404
00:19:30,394 --> 00:19:31,418
Did you remember to water the plants?

405
00:19:31,495 --> 00:19:32,928
Oh, yes. - Excellent.

406
00:19:34,832 --> 00:19:36,265
Thank you.

407
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,301
Hey, Mom, whose money?

408
00:19:51,182 --> 00:19:52,877
Wow.

409
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,542
Son. - Huh?

410
00:19:54,618 --> 00:19:55,550
What was that?

411
00:19:55,619 --> 00:19:57,450
I didn't hear anything.

412
00:19:57,521 --> 00:19:59,648
The altar.

413
00:19:59,724 --> 00:20:00,850
Hmm.

414
00:20:00,925 --> 00:20:02,586
Oh, thanks for coming.

415
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,560
My share. Gimme.

416
00:20:05,963 --> 00:20:06,895
Go. Go.

417
00:20:10,901 --> 00:20:12,698
Hey-

418
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,738
show a little respect.

419
00:20:19,577 --> 00:20:20,976
Now, remember your treatment

420
00:20:21,045 --> 00:20:22,478
next Friday, ladies.

421
00:20:22,546 --> 00:20:25,071
Bring money. Ha ha ha.

422
00:20:25,149 --> 00:20:26,582
Hello, Mrs. Wong.

423
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,379
How are you? Has Master Wong returned?

424
00:20:28,452 --> 00:20:29,714
Yes. He's inside.

425
00:20:29,787 --> 00:20:31,687
Any news about my ginseng?

426
00:20:31,756 --> 00:20:32,688
Did he get it?

427
00:20:32,757 --> 00:20:33,951
Let's ask him. Come in.

428
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:34,957
Oh, thank you.

429
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:36,459
Mr. Chan has come for his ginseng.

430
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:37,960
Ah, Mr. Chan, I'm...

431
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:39,690
Why are you here so soon?

432
00:20:39,764 --> 00:20:40,788
Fei-Hong.

433
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,230
The ginseng's in the back. - I know.

434
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:43,664
Let me get it. - Go on.

435
00:20:43,734 --> 00:20:45,895
It's beautiful. I brought you a whole
root.

436
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:46,959
Wait till you see it.

437
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,335
It's just in back. Some tea?

438
00:20:48,406 --> 00:20:49,600
Ah, you are so kind.

439
00:20:49,673 --> 00:20:51,470
Yes. Please have a seat. I'll be right
back.

440
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:52,668
Thank you.

441
00:20:52,743 --> 00:20:53,937
I'm getting out of here.

442
00:20:54,011 --> 00:20:55,410
Where are you going? You got to help me
out.

443
00:20:55,479 --> 00:20:57,470
When the master finds out, he'll kill me.

444
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:58,480
He will not.

445
00:20:58,549 --> 00:20:59,675
Fei-Hong.

446
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,842
What are you doing?

447
00:21:00,918 --> 00:21:02,010
Stepma, come here.

448
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:04,653
I don't know what to do.

449
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:05,882
We're in such trouble.

450
00:21:05,956 --> 00:21:07,253
I lost the ginseng on the train.

451
00:21:07,324 --> 00:21:09,986
What? What did you do now?

452
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:11,028
What'd she say?

453
00:21:11,095 --> 00:21:12,426
OK, OK, OK. Shh.

454
00:21:12,496 --> 00:21:13,793
Please. You got to help us out.

455
00:21:13,864 --> 00:21:15,092
Fei-Hong!

456
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,098
Yes, Dad!

457
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:17,691
You just go out and serve him tea.

458
00:21:17,768 --> 00:21:19,167
I'll think of something.

459
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,033
I'll leave it up to you two. Coming!

460
00:21:21,105 --> 00:21:23,073
Oh, madam, what should we do about this?

461
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,108
You see that door behind me?

462
00:21:25,176 --> 00:21:26,108
You mean...

463
00:21:26,177 --> 00:21:27,667
In the cabinet. - Sure.

464
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:28,871
There's a black box. - Oh, yeah?

465
00:21:28,946 --> 00:21:29,913
Look inside it.

466
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,345
Ah, another ginseng. I can't believe it!

467
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,814
Strychnine.

468
00:21:32,883 --> 00:21:34,077
What for? - For you.

469
00:21:34,151 --> 00:21:36,085
Oh, no, madam, please don't tease me
this way!

470
00:21:36,153 --> 00:21:37,085
Who's teasing?

471
00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:43,224
I have your tea, Mr. Chan.

472
00:21:43,294 --> 00:21:44,761
Thank you very much, son.

473
00:21:44,829 --> 00:21:45,761
Enjoy it.

474
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,236
Go, go.

475
00:21:57,308 --> 00:21:59,367
Father, you must be very hot.

476
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,933
Let me help you. - Mr. Chan.

477
00:22:01,011 --> 00:22:01,943
Hmm?

478
00:22:03,647 --> 00:22:04,579
Wow.

479
00:22:04,648 --> 00:22:06,138
It's real.

480
00:22:06,217 --> 00:22:08,048
Now, Mr. Chan, I know you have never seen

481
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:10,417
a specimen as beautiful as this, have
you?

482
00:22:10,488 --> 00:22:12,251
Oh, and let me tell you... wait till you
see

483
00:22:12,323 --> 00:22:13,585
what happens to you when you take it.

484
00:22:13,657 --> 00:22:14,954
Why, women won't believe the difference

485
00:22:15,025 --> 00:22:16,458
in your performance, and you will owe it

486
00:22:16,527 --> 00:22:18,461
all to the master.

487
00:22:18,529 --> 00:22:20,622
What are you doing with that rutabaga?

488
00:22:20,698 --> 00:22:21,756
Ohh.

489
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:24,357
Rutabaga?

490
00:22:24,435 --> 00:22:26,335
This is a rutabaga?

491
00:22:26,403 --> 00:22:27,556
You mean it isn't ginseng?

492
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,658
No. - Silly of me.

493
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:31,750
Of course it isn't ginseng. What I meant
to tell you

494
00:22:31,827 --> 00:22:34,261
was that you should stay away from
rutabagas-

495
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,922
especially big rutabagas like this one-

496
00:22:35,998 --> 00:22:37,329
while you're taking ginseng.

497
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:39,390
It causes gas and neutralises the effect

498
00:22:39,468 --> 00:22:41,129
or something like that.

499
00:22:41,203 --> 00:22:43,637
Excuse me.

500
00:22:43,706 --> 00:22:44,934
Mr. Chan...

501
00:22:45,007 --> 00:22:48,272
I'm glad she remembered to tell you
about that.

502
00:22:48,344 --> 00:22:49,436
You know, most people don't realise

503
00:22:49,511 --> 00:22:50,842
that when you use ginseng

504
00:22:50,913 --> 00:22:52,540
you should avoid the use of rutabaga,

505
00:22:52,615 --> 00:22:54,207
because they're not a good mix.

506
00:22:54,283 --> 00:22:56,547
Rutabaga, shmutabaga.

507
00:22:56,619 --> 00:22:59,554
Stop that, Fei-Hong!

508
00:22:59,622 --> 00:23:01,613
Hi. Back so soon?

509
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,351
Oh, Lord. Now what?

510
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:04,722
Good luck, now.

511
00:23:04,793 --> 00:23:05,953
You think this looks like ginseng?

512
00:23:06,028 --> 00:23:08,326
Oh, yeah, it looks just like it.

513
00:23:08,397 --> 00:23:09,329
Where did you find it?

514
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,967
Father's bonsai tree.

515
00:23:12,034 --> 00:23:14,434
What a great idea. Just blame it on Cho.

516
00:23:14,503 --> 00:23:16,300
OK. - Aah!

517
00:23:19,141 --> 00:23:22,304
I'll try to keep your father distracted.

518
00:23:23,379 --> 00:23:25,540
What do you think of this?

519
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:26,945
Boy, that looks great.

520
00:23:27,016 --> 00:23:27,948
Great. I'm a genius.

521
00:23:28,017 --> 00:23:30,144
Excuse me. May I have a word?

522
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,981
Just a second.

523
00:23:33,055 --> 00:23:34,716
Of course. I can wait.

524
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,189
What is it, dear?

525
00:23:36,258 --> 00:23:37,589
Come. - What?

526
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,321
Come on. Just one minute.

527
00:23:39,395 --> 00:23:41,226
Can't this wait? I'm busy right now.

528
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:42,228
I'm sorry. I couldn't wait

529
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:43,423
any longer to tell you.

530
00:23:43,499 --> 00:23:45,933
Fei-Hong is all grown up now.

531
00:23:46,001 --> 00:23:47,525
Someday, he will leave our house.

532
00:23:47,603 --> 00:23:49,400
What? - Oh, you know-

533
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:51,496
how cute he was when he was little.

534
00:23:51,573 --> 00:23:53,097
But why is it wet?

535
00:23:53,175 --> 00:23:55,166
Let me tell you. I'm glad you asked.

536
00:23:55,244 --> 00:23:57,178
Because it was just picked this morning.

537
00:23:57,246 --> 00:23:58,679
You're really going to enjoy the potency

538
00:23:58,747 --> 00:23:59,679
of this one.

539
00:23:59,748 --> 00:24:00,612
It's really powerful.

540
00:24:00,683 --> 00:24:01,809
You just need a little bit.

541
00:24:01,884 --> 00:24:03,909
A little brother around here could take
his place.

542
00:24:03,986 --> 00:24:05,180
We can talk about this later.

543
00:24:05,254 --> 00:24:06,243
Don't be rude.

544
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:08,346
Please, or I will never forgive you.

545
00:24:08,424 --> 00:24:10,255
You shouldn't talk that way to me.

546
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:11,883
Well, you never let me talk.

547
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,257
Honey, not now. Mr. Chan...

548
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:14,260
Don't you turn your back on me.

549
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:16,024
OK. Roll it up tight

550
00:24:16,098 --> 00:24:17,190
to keep it nice and fresh

551
00:24:17,266 --> 00:24:18,699
and keep it close to your heart...

552
00:24:18,767 --> 00:24:19,825
Like that.

553
00:24:19,902 --> 00:24:20,960
Remember what I told you and have a nice
day.

554
00:24:21,036 --> 00:24:21,968
Right.

555
00:24:22,037 --> 00:24:23,129
Yes. I really do think

556
00:24:23,205 --> 00:24:24,137
we need to talk about this now.

557
00:24:24,206 --> 00:24:26,140
Master Wong? Thanks for the ginseng.

558
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,039
Ah. Everything is all right?

559
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,577
Just fine.

560
00:24:29,645 --> 00:24:30,771
I'll keep it inside. - He liked it.

561
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:32,108
Let me see you out.

562
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:33,273
Let Fei-Hong do it.

563
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:35,908
I can show you. Please, this way.

564
00:24:35,984 --> 00:24:37,645
Bye-bye, now. - Goodbye, Mr. Chan.

565
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,187
Anyway, as I was saying

566
00:24:39,254 --> 00:24:40,346
before Mr. Chan interrupted us,

567
00:24:40,422 --> 00:24:41,821
it's time you thought about this.

568
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:43,824
I don't know what you're trying to tell
me.

569
00:24:43,892 --> 00:24:45,359
Mother, Mr. Chan's gone.

570
00:24:45,427 --> 00:24:46,359
Oh, thank God.

571
00:24:46,428 --> 00:24:47,725
What's this all about?

572
00:24:47,796 --> 00:24:49,127
Look, if you don't want to talk about
this

573
00:24:49,198 --> 00:24:50,688
right now, I understand.

574
00:24:50,766 --> 00:24:51,790
You've had a really long trip,

575
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:52,799
and you should get some rest.

576
00:24:52,868 --> 00:24:53,926
Come on. Let's sit down.

577
00:24:54,002 --> 00:24:55,299
Yes, Father. Please take a rest.

578
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,962
It's a good idea.

579
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,166
I better start taking better care of
myself.

580
00:24:59,241 --> 00:25:01,801
I need to realise I'm not getting any
younger.

581
00:25:01,877 --> 00:25:04,311
Well? Why do you make that look?

582
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:06,006
Because I'm afraid he'll find the tree.

583
00:25:06,081 --> 00:25:09,016
Don't be silly. Throw the pot away.

584
00:25:09,084 --> 00:25:10,108
That's not all.

585
00:25:10,185 --> 00:25:11,174
What?

586
00:25:11,253 --> 00:25:13,084
What happens when Mr. Chan drinks the tea

587
00:25:13,155 --> 00:25:14,213
made from those roots?

588
00:25:14,289 --> 00:25:16,757
Ho ho ho! So he will get a little dizzy.

589
00:25:16,825 --> 00:25:18,986
He's going to have the time of his
life.

590
00:25:19,061 --> 00:25:20,961
I wish I could say the same.

591
00:25:25,033 --> 00:25:27,331
All right, all right. That's it for
me.

592
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:28,630
See you tomorrow.

593
00:25:28,704 --> 00:25:31,104
Hey, thanks for bringing it down.

594
00:25:31,173 --> 00:25:32,868
Ho Sang, she's cooling down.

595
00:25:32,941 --> 00:25:33,873
Can you give me some more fire?

596
00:25:33,942 --> 00:25:35,933
Just give me one minute.

597
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:43,851
Stand back.

598
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:49,917
That was great. Thanks for the light.

599
00:25:49,992 --> 00:25:51,584
Almost quitting time.

600
00:25:54,463 --> 00:25:56,590
After this, I ought to.

601
00:26:00,035 --> 00:26:01,002
That's it!

602
00:26:05,507 --> 00:26:07,634
See you tomorrow.

603
00:26:09,144 --> 00:26:10,406
Hey!

604
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:13,141
Get them back to work.

605
00:26:13,215 --> 00:26:14,375
But why?

606
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:15,677
Go!

607
00:26:15,751 --> 00:26:18,276
I'm the new foreman here. Now ring the
bell.

608
00:26:18,353 --> 00:26:19,820
Go on.

609
00:26:19,888 --> 00:26:21,480
Yes, sir.

610
00:26:27,763 --> 00:26:29,230
Hey, Ho Sang,

611
00:26:29,298 --> 00:26:31,198
what the hell you doing now?

612
00:26:31,266 --> 00:26:32,893
Yeah, what are you, out of your mind?

613
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:34,401
Sorry.

614
00:26:36,772 --> 00:26:38,637
I was just told that we have a new
foreman here.

615
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:41,300
New foreman?

616
00:26:41,376 --> 00:26:42,502
Well-

617
00:26:43,846 --> 00:26:45,973
we seem to have fallen behind this month,

618
00:26:46,048 --> 00:26:48,915
so everybody works the night shift

619
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:50,246
for one month.

620
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:52,184
What? Extra shifts?

621
00:26:54,723 --> 00:26:56,554
Hey, hold on.

622
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:58,252
So, let's say we work

623
00:26:58,327 --> 00:27:00,261
all those overtime hours for you-

624
00:27:00,329 --> 00:27:01,626
then we need overtime pay.

625
00:27:03,198 --> 00:27:04,756
Quiet.

626
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:06,391
You give us no choice.

627
00:27:06,468 --> 00:27:08,026
You either work the overtime,

628
00:27:08,103 --> 00:27:09,570
or we close the steel mill down,

629
00:27:09,638 --> 00:27:11,469
and you'll all be without jobs.

630
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,701
Now, you can take it or leave it.

631
00:27:13,775 --> 00:27:16,710
Mr. Smith, you can't blackmail us anymore.

632
00:27:16,778 --> 00:27:17,904
We worked hard for you,

633
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,470
and now we've had enough!

634
00:27:19,548 --> 00:27:20,572
We quit!

635
00:27:23,352 --> 00:27:24,979
Hold it!

636
00:27:25,053 --> 00:27:27,078
Nobody is to leave.

637
00:27:27,155 --> 00:27:29,089
You'll stay and work.

638
00:27:29,157 --> 00:27:30,146
Do you understand that?

639
00:27:30,225 --> 00:27:32,056
You can take my job,

640
00:27:32,127 --> 00:27:33,389
but you can't run my life!

641
00:27:33,462 --> 00:27:34,690
You think you can make us?

642
00:27:34,763 --> 00:27:36,458
Who you think you are? Let's go!

643
00:27:40,636 --> 00:27:41,625
Don't move!

644
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:43,102
You're in our way!

645
00:27:45,574 --> 00:27:48,543
All of you, right now! Get back to work!

646
00:27:51,346 --> 00:27:52,278
Strike breaker!

647
00:27:52,347 --> 00:27:53,974
That's enough!

648
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:55,641
Aah!

649
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:57,548
Aah!

650
00:27:57,619 --> 00:27:59,052
Free him!

651
00:27:59,121 --> 00:28:00,418
Ahh! Ohh!

652
00:28:00,489 --> 00:28:01,820
Get him!

653
00:28:04,826 --> 00:28:07,056
Aah!

654
00:28:09,131 --> 00:28:11,395
Everyone up! Back to work!

655
00:28:11,466 --> 00:28:13,798
Great!

656
00:28:13,869 --> 00:28:15,996
You see? He's very persuasive.

657
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:17,561
They're going to get right back to work.

658
00:28:17,639 --> 00:28:18,867
Ha ha ha!

659
00:28:18,941 --> 00:28:20,568
Huhh!

660
00:28:20,642 --> 00:28:22,109
No, again.

661
00:28:22,177 --> 00:28:23,337
Ki-yah! - Huhh!

662
00:28:23,412 --> 00:28:24,674
Ki-yah!

663
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:26,373
Ki-yah! Ki-yah!

664
00:28:26,448 --> 00:28:28,814
Ki-yah! Ki-yah!

665
00:28:28,884 --> 00:28:30,044
Ki-yah!

666
00:28:30,118 --> 00:28:31,210
Ki-yah!

667
00:28:31,286 --> 00:28:32,548
Ki-yah!

668
00:28:32,621 --> 00:28:34,452
Ki-yah! Ki-yah!

669
00:28:34,523 --> 00:28:36,457
Black Tiger Slash! Ha! Ki-yah!

670
00:28:36,525 --> 00:28:37,992
Ki-yah!

671
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,426
OK, now! Clean!

672
00:28:43,198 --> 00:28:46,167
It's bloody impossible to sleep with all
this noise.

673
00:28:46,234 --> 00:28:48,464
Why don't we just buy it and have it
bulldozed?

674
00:28:48,537 --> 00:28:50,027
You know that we've been through this
before.

675
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:51,572
Mr. Wong refuses to sell.

676
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,698
It's ruining my life,

677
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:54,605
so why don't you go and do something
about it?

678
00:28:54,676 --> 00:28:55,734
Yes, sir.

679
00:29:11,526 --> 00:29:13,153
I'll catch you later!

680
00:29:13,228 --> 00:29:15,560
Hey, Fun, you're working too hard.

681
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,996
You need husband to run that snake stand,
huh?

682
00:29:18,066 --> 00:29:19,465
Perfect job for me, huh?

683
00:29:19,534 --> 00:29:20,796
Ha ha ha ha!

684
00:29:20,869 --> 00:29:22,063
A husband, huh?

685
00:29:22,137 --> 00:29:23,764
Yeah. I bet you'd be running away

686
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:25,431
from these snakes all day.

687
00:29:25,507 --> 00:29:26,633
Come on, now.

688
00:29:26,708 --> 00:29:28,573
Why would I want to pay some lazy man

689
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:30,008
when I can do it better, huh?

690
00:29:30,078 --> 00:29:32,706
You know, you make good point.

691
00:29:32,781 --> 00:29:34,442
But seriously now, Fun,

692
00:29:34,516 --> 00:29:35,744
you know, you don't have man around,

693
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:38,342
so I worry about your safety.

694
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,752
Hey, Fun, I've been thinking...

695
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:41,754
Let me teach you kung fu.

696
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:43,757
How about drunken boxing?

697
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:46,157
Where did you get that idea?

698
00:29:46,228 --> 00:29:47,752
No one does that.

699
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:48,989
If you really want to fight,

700
00:29:49,064 --> 00:29:51,191
I teach you the Choy Li Fu boxing style.

701
00:29:51,266 --> 00:29:53,029
Oh, wise man speak.

702
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,196
What you looking at?

703
00:29:56,271 --> 00:29:58,239
Get back to work.

704
00:30:00,042 --> 00:30:01,304
We've got customers waiting.

705
00:30:01,376 --> 00:30:02,536
They need the help now.

706
00:30:02,611 --> 00:30:03,737
Yellowtail!

707
00:30:03,812 --> 00:30:05,439
Yellowtail? OK.

708
00:30:05,514 --> 00:30:06,769
Drunken boxing.

709
00:30:06,903 --> 00:30:08,495
What does she know anyway?

710
00:30:08,571 --> 00:30:09,731
Hey, Chang Tsan.

711
00:30:09,806 --> 00:30:11,103
Huh?

712
00:30:11,174 --> 00:30:12,106
What, Fei-Hong?

713
00:30:12,175 --> 00:30:13,540
A fillet of salmon

714
00:30:13,609 --> 00:30:17,101
and a pound of fish marrow, OK?

715
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,807
Hey, where are you going?

716
00:30:20,383 --> 00:30:21,350
Really soft skin,

717
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:22,475
but the meat is tougher.

718
00:30:22,552 --> 00:30:25,146
Hey, Fun, I'm going to need a few things,
OK?

719
00:30:25,221 --> 00:30:26,916
Ohh! - Hi.

720
00:30:26,989 --> 00:30:27,921
Oh, it's getting away.

721
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,252
Oh! Ha ha ha!

722
00:30:29,325 --> 00:30:31,452
One pheasant and two orders of har gow.

723
00:30:31,527 --> 00:30:33,085
Ah, that would've been my choice.

724
00:30:33,162 --> 00:30:35,187
I've been waiting for a long time.

725
00:30:36,265 --> 00:30:37,698
Here. - Thank you.

726
00:30:37,767 --> 00:30:39,166
You want this or not?

727
00:30:39,235 --> 00:30:40,896
I got a customer waiting.

728
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,062
Oh, yeah. I'll be right there.

729
00:30:42,138 --> 00:30:43,298
Oh, Fei-Hong.

730
00:30:43,372 --> 00:30:45,602
I hear drunken boxing is the best.

731
00:30:45,675 --> 00:30:46,972
Would you be able to teach me?

732
00:30:47,043 --> 00:30:48,101
How about it?

733
00:30:48,177 --> 00:30:49,701
Of course. Anytime.

734
00:30:49,779 --> 00:30:50,973
Hey!

735
00:30:51,047 --> 00:30:52,776
How about I bone it for you, eh?

736
00:30:52,849 --> 00:30:54,146
Oh, no. That's all right.

737
00:30:54,217 --> 00:30:55,377
How about later with that?

738
00:30:55,451 --> 00:30:58,943
We're discussing drunken boxing.

739
00:30:59,021 --> 00:31:01,489
Fei-Hong, when do you think you could
teach me?

740
00:31:01,557 --> 00:31:03,582
Anytime would be fine. You just let me
know.

741
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:05,058
Fun, you need real instructor

742
00:31:05,127 --> 00:31:06,560
to learn how to fight.

743
00:31:06,629 --> 00:31:10,121
Maybe Chang Tsan can give you a lesson.

744
00:31:10,199 --> 00:31:11,791
He doesn't teach the style I like.

745
00:31:11,868 --> 00:31:13,096
It's for fighting.

746
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:14,830
Drunken master just for show.

747
00:31:14,904 --> 00:31:16,531
You cannot win fight that way.

748
00:31:16,606 --> 00:31:18,767
Forget him. He's jealous.

749
00:31:18,841 --> 00:31:19,830
I like your style.

750
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:22,070
Fei-Hong, time to admit it.

751
00:31:22,144 --> 00:31:25,307
Your drunken boxing is no match for Choy
Li Fu.

752
00:31:25,381 --> 00:31:27,406
Isn't that right? You agree?

753
00:31:27,483 --> 00:31:29,041
Yeah! Right! That's right.

754
00:31:29,118 --> 00:31:30,551
Master much better.

755
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,609
He knows.

756
00:31:31,687 --> 00:31:33,120
Depends on who's fighting.

757
00:31:33,189 --> 00:31:34,588
What do you say to a challenge, then?

758
00:31:34,657 --> 00:31:36,591
Out of my way.

759
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:38,786
My Choy Li Fu, your drunken boxing.

760
00:31:38,861 --> 00:31:40,488
And if I lose, you can have your fish

761
00:31:40,563 --> 00:31:43,259
and anything else you want no charge, on
me.

762
00:31:43,332 --> 00:31:44,959
Listen-

763
00:31:45,034 --> 00:31:46,501
you can learn from Fei-Hong.

764
00:31:46,569 --> 00:31:48,628
I don't need your help.

765
00:31:50,773 --> 00:31:52,707
I appreciate the offer,

766
00:31:52,775 --> 00:31:54,037
but there's too many people here,

767
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,236
and somebody could get hurt.

768
00:31:55,311 --> 00:31:57,472
No way, Fei-Hong. You're going to fight
this time.

769
00:31:57,546 --> 00:31:59,377
Attention, everybody!

770
00:31:59,448 --> 00:32:01,211
Listen!

771
00:32:01,284 --> 00:32:03,479
I'm Chang Tsan, and this is Wong Fei-
Hong.

772
00:32:03,552 --> 00:32:04,678
It's your lucky day.

773
00:32:04,754 --> 00:32:07,018
I have challenged him to a fight.

774
00:32:07,089 --> 00:32:08,021
Come on.

775
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,022
I'll hold this.

776
00:32:09,091 --> 00:32:11,184
Remember, it's an exhibition match,

777
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,727
so go on.

778
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,795
Hah! Hah! Hi! Hyah!

779
00:32:15,865 --> 00:32:17,298
Oh.

780
00:32:34,717 --> 00:32:36,116
Drunken boxing.

781
00:32:40,189 --> 00:32:41,520
Haah!

782
00:33:11,487 --> 00:33:12,715
Ah!

783
00:33:14,523 --> 00:33:16,388
OK, OK, that's enough.

784
00:33:16,459 --> 00:33:19,292
All right, that's enough. The winner is
Fei-Hong.

785
00:33:19,362 --> 00:33:21,853
No. Really, it was a draw.

786
00:33:21,931 --> 00:33:22,863
I think Chang Tsan would agree.

787
00:33:22,932 --> 00:33:23,990
It's not over yet.

788
00:33:26,535 --> 00:33:27,832
Fei-Hong!

789
00:33:27,903 --> 00:33:31,134
Yeah, I'm coming! It's my stepma.

790
00:33:31,207 --> 00:33:32,970
- Come on! - I got to go. Thank
you, Fun.

791
00:33:33,042 --> 00:33:35,033
See you tomorrow.

792
00:33:35,111 --> 00:33:36,043
Fish. - Why, thank you.

793
00:33:36,112 --> 00:33:37,477
What do I owe you for this?

794
00:33:37,546 --> 00:33:38,604
You can have it.

795
00:33:38,681 --> 00:33:40,444
Thanks a lot.

796
00:33:40,516 --> 00:33:42,279
Thank you. Excuse me.

797
00:33:42,351 --> 00:33:44,478
Everyone saw it was a draw, right?

798
00:33:44,553 --> 00:33:46,487
OK, OK, show over.

799
00:33:48,391 --> 00:33:50,359
Don't tell me you were fighting for food
again.

800
00:33:50,426 --> 00:33:51,358
Me? No way.

801
00:33:51,427 --> 00:33:52,416
You know your father will kill you

802
00:33:52,495 --> 00:33:53,621
if he hears about it.

803
00:33:53,763 --> 00:33:55,856
How can I replace the ginseng?

804
00:33:55,931 --> 00:33:57,330
Pawn my diamond necklace, that's how.

805
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,367
But, why?

806
00:33:58,434 --> 00:33:59,458
We'll be in big trouble

807
00:33:59,535 --> 00:34:01,730
if Mr. Chan decides to brew that tree
root.

808
00:34:01,804 --> 00:34:02,736
You would do that?

809
00:34:02,805 --> 00:34:05,865
Just remember, you owe me one.

810
00:34:05,941 --> 00:34:06,873
Yeah.

811
00:34:08,844 --> 00:34:11,711
Hey, that's the guy we're looking for.

812
00:34:11,781 --> 00:34:14,875
Stay close to him while I go and get the
boss, OK?

813
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,178
Yes, sir.

814
00:34:16,252 --> 00:34:18,345
Stop here.

815
00:34:18,421 --> 00:34:19,649
Ah, OK, here's the money.

816
00:34:19,722 --> 00:34:21,053
I'm sure they're high quality.

817
00:34:21,123 --> 00:34:22,055
She got them from her husband.

818
00:34:22,124 --> 00:34:25,116
Look, I'm late already. Let's go, OK?

819
00:34:25,194 --> 00:34:27,822
So, was the drought very serious?

820
00:34:27,897 --> 00:34:29,091
In that province,

821
00:34:29,165 --> 00:34:31,099
rice and grain were scarce before there
was a drought.

822
00:34:31,167 --> 00:34:33,601
With no rainfall, there will be no
harvest,

823
00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:34,966
and that is serious.

824
00:34:35,037 --> 00:34:36,197
We must act now.

825
00:34:36,272 --> 00:34:37,398
It's so bad.

826
00:34:37,473 --> 00:34:38,906
They're so poor that some families

827
00:34:38,974 --> 00:34:40,737
have to share a single pair of pants.

828
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,402
Wow. Who gets to wear them?

829
00:34:42,478 --> 00:34:44,412
If you have job, you wear the pants.

830
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,412
Oh, wow.

831
00:34:45,481 --> 00:34:46,607
Hello. Sorry I'm late.

832
00:34:46,682 --> 00:34:49,082
It's all right. How are you?

833
00:34:49,151 --> 00:34:50,209
Good to see you.

834
00:34:50,286 --> 00:34:52,083
Fei-Hong, don't you think we should be
going?

835
00:34:52,154 --> 00:34:54,645
Aren't you meeting my wife for tea?

836
00:34:54,723 --> 00:34:57,157
Oh, no, not mah-jongg again.

837
00:34:57,226 --> 00:34:58,284
How can you say that?

838
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,292
It's our fund-raising meeting,

839
00:34:59,361 --> 00:35:01,226
and you were supposed to remind me.

840
00:35:01,297 --> 00:35:03,026
Oh, I almost forgot. We'd better be
going.

841
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:04,396
Ah. You don't want to keep them waiting.

842
00:35:04,467 --> 00:35:05,399
You should go.

843
00:35:05,468 --> 00:35:06,400
Of course. You're right.

844
00:35:06,469 --> 00:35:07,663
Bye. - Goodbye.

845
00:35:07,736 --> 00:35:08,668
Good day.

846
00:35:08,737 --> 00:35:09,669
No mah-jongg!

847
00:35:09,738 --> 00:35:11,797
Yes, sir.

848
00:35:11,874 --> 00:35:13,808
This guy over here.

849
00:35:15,144 --> 00:35:16,611
Go tell John.

850
00:35:17,847 --> 00:35:20,008
It's been called to our attention

851
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:22,448
that Master Wong needs us to lend him
some money.

852
00:35:22,518 --> 00:35:24,782
Oh, no, no, no. That's not for me.

853
00:35:24,854 --> 00:35:26,287
I'm sure I speak for everyone.

854
00:35:26,355 --> 00:35:27,287
We'll just take up a collection.

855
00:35:28,424 --> 00:35:30,255
I don't personally need any of your
money.

856
00:35:30,326 --> 00:35:31,315
It's for the drought victims.

857
00:35:31,393 --> 00:35:32,325
But your wife...

858
00:35:32,394 --> 00:35:34,089
Look, it's nothing to be ashamed of.

859
00:35:34,163 --> 00:35:35,152
This could happen to you.

860
00:35:35,231 --> 00:35:36,664
I say if Mr. Wong needs money...

861
00:35:36,732 --> 00:35:38,563
Nothing right now.

862
00:35:38,634 --> 00:35:39,566
You sure?

863
00:35:39,635 --> 00:35:40,567
You better not have said anything,

864
00:35:40,636 --> 00:35:41,898
you understand?

865
00:35:41,971 --> 00:35:43,370
I won't tell a soul.

866
00:35:43,439 --> 00:35:45,031
Besides, she's the one that talks a lot.

867
00:35:45,107 --> 00:35:46,597
Like you don't?

868
00:35:46,675 --> 00:35:49,576
How dare you say that? I only told my
sister...

869
00:35:49,645 --> 00:35:51,340
Qu doesn't even know I came here.

870
00:35:51,413 --> 00:35:53,608
Whoa, ladies, somebody has been talking.

871
00:35:53,682 --> 00:35:55,775
They always lie to me. Look at their
faces.

872
00:35:55,851 --> 00:35:57,409
Now, that's enough.

873
00:35:57,486 --> 00:35:59,477
Can't we just take a look?

874
00:35:59,555 --> 00:36:00,613
Let's see.

875
00:36:00,689 --> 00:36:01,621
There.

876
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:03,783
Hey, careful!

877
00:36:03,859 --> 00:36:05,520
Oh, so beautiful.

878
00:36:11,967 --> 00:36:14,128
Oh, don't handle it like that.

879
00:36:14,203 --> 00:36:15,465
And I'm only borrowing the money.

880
00:36:15,538 --> 00:36:16,971
You're going to have to give it back to
me.

881
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:19,098
I know, I know. I understand.

882
00:36:19,175 --> 00:36:20,506
Come on. Show it to us.

883
00:36:20,576 --> 00:36:21,508
Here.

884
00:36:21,577 --> 00:36:23,067
So, did you get it?

885
00:36:23,145 --> 00:36:24,373
No. I haven't actually seen it,

886
00:36:24,446 --> 00:36:26,004
but I'm sure they have it.

887
00:36:26,081 --> 00:36:27,912
Well, we can't waste any more time.

888
00:36:27,983 --> 00:36:31,146
Grab the seal, and we'll meet you out
front.

889
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,915
OK, grab it, and I'll see you outside.

890
00:36:32,988 --> 00:36:34,979
Oh, you're so lucky.

891
00:36:35,057 --> 00:36:36,422
You're lucky.

892
00:36:36,492 --> 00:36:39,188
Ah, it's so beautiful on you.

893
00:36:39,261 --> 00:36:40,694
Hey, wait!

894
00:36:42,031 --> 00:36:44,090
The necklace is gone.

895
00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:45,758
You've got to learn to speak up.

896
00:36:45,834 --> 00:36:47,699
Stop him!

897
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:50,261
Stop him!

898
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:51,863
Stop! Come on!

899
00:36:51,941 --> 00:36:53,374
Let's go!

900
00:36:59,481 --> 00:37:00,539
Huh?

901
00:37:00,616 --> 00:37:02,516
Leave it.

902
00:37:04,353 --> 00:37:05,445
Fei-Hong!

903
00:37:05,521 --> 00:37:06,510
It's over there!

904
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:09,617
He went that way! Go!

905
00:37:09,692 --> 00:37:10,852
Excuse me!

906
00:37:10,926 --> 00:37:11,915
Excuse me!

907
00:37:23,005 --> 00:37:23,937
You better run.

908
00:37:24,006 --> 00:37:25,564
Fei-Hong, you're my hero!

909
00:37:25,641 --> 00:37:28,872
Oh, you are a hero.

910
00:37:28,944 --> 00:37:30,070
Hey, Fei-Hong.

911
00:37:30,145 --> 00:37:31,077
You see that?

912
00:37:31,146 --> 00:37:32,807
Atta way.

913
00:37:36,952 --> 00:37:38,044
What's this?

914
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,144
You bumped me.

915
00:37:39,221 --> 00:37:41,451
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

916
00:37:41,523 --> 00:37:42,785
No. That's not good enough.

917
00:37:44,193 --> 00:37:45,125
Did I miss something?

918
00:37:45,194 --> 00:37:47,458
Get on your knees and bow... right now.

919
00:37:47,529 --> 00:37:49,463
What? You must be out of your mind.

920
00:37:49,531 --> 00:37:50,520
Leave him alone.

921
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:52,794
You were in on it. I saw the whole thing.

922
00:37:52,868 --> 00:37:54,392
Why don't you mind your own business,
bitch?

923
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,335
Hey, who you calling bitch?

924
00:37:56,405 --> 00:37:57,633
I can't let him get away with that.

925
00:37:57,706 --> 00:37:59,037
And who the hell do you think you are

926
00:37:59,108 --> 00:38:00,632
strutting around here like a peacock

927
00:38:00,709 --> 00:38:02,233
in that bad English suit of yours?

928
00:38:02,311 --> 00:38:03,746
I think I should kick your ass.

929
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,744
Oh, yeah?

930
00:38:04,814 --> 00:38:05,906
Wait! Uhh!

931
00:38:05,982 --> 00:38:07,006
Uhh.

932
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:08,072
Mom, are you all right?

933
00:38:08,151 --> 00:38:09,118
Go away.

934
00:38:09,185 --> 00:38:11,244
I want this guy. I can taste it.

935
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,049
Hey, hey, take it easy. You'll be OK.

936
00:38:13,122 --> 00:38:14,646
Oh, she wants to fight?

937
00:38:14,724 --> 00:38:15,748
We'll take the two of you.

938
00:38:15,825 --> 00:38:18,123
What? You're going to start this again?

939
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:20,761
What'd you say?

940
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:22,058
I said, kick his ass!

941
00:38:22,131 --> 00:38:23,155
You want me to go kick...

942
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:25,166
You will, or I will.

943
00:38:25,234 --> 00:38:26,166
All right.

944
00:38:26,235 --> 00:38:27,668
Oh, what happened?

945
00:38:27,737 --> 00:38:28,669
I'm all right.

946
00:38:33,976 --> 00:38:36,171
He's a very good fighter.

947
00:38:36,245 --> 00:38:38,338
The necklace is inside. It's going to be
ruined!

948
00:38:38,414 --> 00:38:39,381
The necklace?

949
00:38:39,448 --> 00:38:41,643
Fei-Hong! Over here, Fei- Hong!

950
00:38:41,717 --> 00:38:43,241
Here.

951
00:38:52,728 --> 00:38:56,220
Where'd he learn to do that?

952
00:38:56,299 --> 00:38:57,789
Po Chi Lam.

953
00:38:57,867 --> 00:38:59,528
He does drunken boxing, doesn't he?

954
00:38:59,602 --> 00:39:00,899
Oh, well, then, maybe he'll give us

955
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:03,837
an exhibition on drunken boxing.

956
00:39:03,906 --> 00:39:05,237
All right.

957
00:39:05,308 --> 00:39:08,277
Whatever you want. Fei-Hong! Come here!

958
00:39:10,913 --> 00:39:12,380
All right-

959
00:39:12,448 --> 00:39:14,040
time for drunken boxing.

960
00:39:14,116 --> 00:39:15,344
What about Father?

961
00:39:15,418 --> 00:39:16,350
I'll take care of him.

962
00:39:16,419 --> 00:39:18,011
Besides, it will be great publicity

963
00:39:18,087 --> 00:39:19,019
for the school.

964
00:39:19,088 --> 00:39:20,146
Your dad will be happy.

965
00:39:20,223 --> 00:39:21,155
OK.

966
00:39:21,224 --> 00:39:22,657
Drunken boxing!

967
00:39:22,725 --> 00:39:25,125
All right, what are you scared of?

968
00:39:25,194 --> 00:39:26,491
Four of you guys can't beat one?

969
00:39:39,508 --> 00:39:40,770
Get him!

970
00:39:40,843 --> 00:39:42,276
Waah!

971
00:39:53,089 --> 00:39:54,147
What is that, huh?

972
00:39:54,223 --> 00:39:55,155
It's drunken boxing.

973
00:39:55,224 --> 00:39:56,156
Oh.

974
00:39:56,225 --> 00:39:57,157
Come on, now. What do you think?

975
00:39:57,226 --> 00:39:58,158
Well, can he do more?

976
00:39:58,227 --> 00:39:59,524
Of course he can. Yeah.

977
00:39:59,595 --> 00:40:01,529
Hey, you're a bunch of fools.

978
00:40:01,597 --> 00:40:02,894
Come on.

979
00:40:02,965 --> 00:40:04,296
Oh. Let's go.

980
00:40:04,367 --> 00:40:05,299
Wait for us.

981
00:40:08,037 --> 00:40:09,231
Take as much as you can carry.

982
00:40:09,305 --> 00:40:10,237
OK.

983
00:40:10,306 --> 00:40:11,534
Hey, who's going to pay for that?

984
00:40:11,607 --> 00:40:13,074
Master Wong's charge account.

985
00:40:13,142 --> 00:40:14,074
All right, then.

986
00:40:16,746 --> 00:40:18,839
Hey, where'd they go?

987
00:40:18,915 --> 00:40:19,904
Over there, I think.

988
00:40:19,982 --> 00:40:21,745
Let's go. - Wait for us! Hurry, ladies!

989
00:40:24,787 --> 00:40:25,981
What are they doing?

990
00:40:26,055 --> 00:40:27,181
What's that?

991
00:40:27,256 --> 00:40:28,655
Don't know.

992
00:40:30,293 --> 00:40:32,420
Oh! I'm going to call the police.

993
00:40:32,495 --> 00:40:33,553
Don't do that.

994
00:40:33,629 --> 00:40:36,723
Fei-Hong, I brought you some help.

995
00:40:36,799 --> 00:40:37,731
But Father will kill me.

996
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,700
You can blame it all on me.

997
00:40:39,769 --> 00:40:40,736
You're going to lose if you don't,

998
00:40:40,803 --> 00:40:41,735
so just go ahead.

999
00:40:43,072 --> 00:40:44,039
Yeah.

1000
00:40:47,476 --> 00:40:49,137
Here you go... another bottle.

1001
00:40:52,448 --> 00:40:54,916
Aah!

1002
00:40:54,984 --> 00:40:57,384
Two at once?

1003
00:40:57,453 --> 00:40:59,580
Do you think that's a good idea?

1004
00:40:59,655 --> 00:41:00,917
Don't worry. It gives him power.

1005
00:41:04,093 --> 00:41:07,392
Yaah!

1006
00:41:18,741 --> 00:41:20,231
Ow!

1007
00:41:20,309 --> 00:41:21,503
Ow!

1008
00:41:26,082 --> 00:41:27,014
Uhh!

1009
00:41:31,387 --> 00:41:32,319
Ohh!

1010
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:36,123
Are you all right?

1011
00:41:36,192 --> 00:41:38,023
What?

1012
00:41:39,562 --> 00:41:41,052
One more drink would be helpful.

1013
00:41:42,698 --> 00:41:43,790
Here is the very last bottle.

1014
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:55,370
Yii!

1015
00:41:55,444 --> 00:41:56,376
You, get up!

1016
00:42:04,153 --> 00:42:05,518
Ow! What the hell was that?

1017
00:42:07,423 --> 00:42:08,355
What does it mean

1018
00:42:08,424 --> 00:42:09,482
when there's a picture of a skull?

1019
00:42:09,558 --> 00:42:12,049
Oh. Good stuff.

1020
00:42:22,838 --> 00:42:24,465
The last one really hit the spot.

1021
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,472
Whoo!

1022
00:42:32,314 --> 00:42:34,680
Monkey Drinks Master's Wine.

1023
00:42:41,123 --> 00:42:42,818
That was Crazy Corkscrew

1024
00:42:42,892 --> 00:42:43,950
Open Wine Bottle.

1025
00:42:45,194 --> 00:42:47,628
White Tiger Washes Face.

1026
00:42:49,565 --> 00:42:51,032
Turn the Barrel!

1027
00:42:52,234 --> 00:42:53,565
What's wrong? You have a hangover?

1028
00:42:53,636 --> 00:42:54,967
Kill him!

1029
00:42:55,037 --> 00:42:56,800
Do you like Drunken Monkey?

1030
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,172
Ee-hee!

1031
00:42:59,241 --> 00:43:00,765
Ay!

1032
00:43:02,745 --> 00:43:04,542
Ah, Eagle Carries Wine Bottle.

1033
00:43:04,613 --> 00:43:05,545
Got you now!

1034
00:43:08,751 --> 00:43:10,275
Attack! Waterfall!

1035
00:43:11,654 --> 00:43:13,815
That one there, I showed him.

1036
00:43:13,889 --> 00:43:16,289
Here is Peter Piper Playing the Flute.

1037
00:43:16,358 --> 00:43:17,825
Mmm! Ooh! Ha ha ha!

1038
00:43:17,893 --> 00:43:20,054
Oh, that's a good one.

1039
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,631
Down the Hatch!

1040
00:43:28,104 --> 00:43:30,004
Wheelbarrow.

1041
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:35,668
Ahh!

1042
00:43:35,744 --> 00:43:38,304
Drunken Maid Flirting With the Master.

1043
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:42,683
Aah! - Snake Eyes.

1044
00:43:52,828 --> 00:43:53,760
Ohh!

1045
00:43:53,829 --> 00:43:55,592
And this one?

1046
00:43:55,664 --> 00:43:57,564
Uh, Gypsy Wine.

1047
00:43:57,633 --> 00:43:59,100
It's called Gypsy what?

1048
00:43:59,168 --> 00:44:00,567
Just watch.

1049
00:44:00,636 --> 00:44:01,967
Aah!

1050
00:44:03,072 --> 00:44:05,233
Uncle Stirs the Barrel.

1051
00:44:14,717 --> 00:44:16,480
Come back!

1052
00:44:16,552 --> 00:44:17,484
Fei-Hong!

1053
00:44:17,553 --> 00:44:18,520
He can't even stand up straight!

1054
00:44:18,587 --> 00:44:19,679
Find some more wine.

1055
00:44:19,755 --> 00:44:20,687
Of course.

1056
00:44:20,756 --> 00:44:21,688
Aah!

1057
00:44:21,757 --> 00:44:23,588
Master Wong! What's going on here?

1058
00:44:23,659 --> 00:44:26,287
Those men are attacking Fei-Hong!

1059
00:44:26,362 --> 00:44:28,091
Hold this. Fei-Hong!

1060
00:44:29,765 --> 00:44:30,697
Fei-Hong!

1061
00:44:30,766 --> 00:44:32,199
Smash Bottle Against the Wall!

1062
00:44:34,236 --> 00:44:37,103
Oh, no!

1063
00:44:37,173 --> 00:44:39,198
Fei-Hong!

1064
00:44:39,275 --> 00:44:41,038
Ha ha! - Have you been drinking?

1065
00:44:42,811 --> 00:44:44,574
You stop it right now!

1066
00:44:46,549 --> 00:44:48,176
Down the Hatch!

1067
00:44:51,086 --> 00:44:52,018
What are you doing?

1068
00:44:52,087 --> 00:44:53,884
Uh, Father?

1069
00:44:56,158 --> 00:44:59,025
Ohh...

1070
00:44:59,094 --> 00:45:01,654
Ha ha! You have the cutest little nose.

1071
00:45:04,433 --> 00:45:06,333
Look how well they get along.

1072
00:45:06,402 --> 00:45:08,734
How are you, Dad?

1073
00:45:08,804 --> 00:45:10,066
Fighting again!

1074
00:45:10,139 --> 00:45:11,629
Fighting? OK.

1075
00:45:11,707 --> 00:45:13,504
You should have been here.

1076
00:45:13,576 --> 00:45:15,271
Fei-Hong defeated all five of those
gangsters.

1077
00:45:15,344 --> 00:45:17,175
What was this all about?

1078
00:45:17,246 --> 00:45:18,679
They tried to steal the diamond necklace

1079
00:45:18,747 --> 00:45:19,907
that Ling sold to me.

1080
00:45:19,982 --> 00:45:21,574
What?

1081
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:23,777
You sold your diamond necklace?

1082
00:45:23,852 --> 00:45:26,343
Why didn't you tell us Po Chi Lam needed
more money?

1083
00:45:26,422 --> 00:45:28,617
We would have helped you. You know we're
all friends here.

1084
00:45:28,691 --> 00:45:31,524
No. The school doesn't need money.

1085
00:45:31,594 --> 00:45:33,926
Here, you can take charge of the funds
we raised.

1086
00:45:35,831 --> 00:45:38,527
Stop that! Fei-Hong!

1087
00:45:39,602 --> 00:45:41,069
Hi. - Hello, Madam Wong.

1088
00:45:41,136 --> 00:45:42,433
I said stop it!

1089
00:45:42,504 --> 00:45:44,267
No, please, Master Wong, don't hurt him!

1090
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,307
He's drunk!

1091
00:45:45,374 --> 00:45:47,308
Mom, fetch me another bottle.

1092
00:45:47,376 --> 00:45:48,604
Go home now!

1093
00:45:48,677 --> 00:45:49,974
Now!

1094
00:45:50,045 --> 00:45:52,036
Yes, dear.

1095
00:45:52,114 --> 00:45:55,709
Do as he says. All right.

1096
00:45:55,784 --> 00:45:56,910
See you.

1097
00:45:56,986 --> 00:46:02,686
Go home now, Daddy

1098
00:46:02,758 --> 00:46:06,592
Go on. Follow him!

1099
00:46:06,662 --> 00:46:08,095
Losers.

1100
00:46:08,163 --> 00:46:09,665
You didn't do any better.

1101
00:46:09,799 --> 00:46:11,426
And what were you trying to do?

1102
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,331
You've ruined the school's reputation!

1103
00:46:13,402 --> 00:46:14,528
They think we're broke!

1104
00:46:14,603 --> 00:46:16,969
And you, you idiot, what have I told you

1105
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:19,803
about drunken boxing and fighting in the
streets?

1106
00:46:19,875 --> 00:46:22,708
Now, tell me, is everything here so bad

1107
00:46:22,778 --> 00:46:24,006
you have to sell your diamonds?

1108
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,843
Come on! Do you really think

1109
00:46:25,915 --> 00:46:27,507
I would have sold something

1110
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,982
that's precious to us? I would never!

1111
00:46:29,051 --> 00:46:31,246
Don't lie to me!

1112
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,345
How much money did you lose playing mah-
jongg?

1113
00:46:33,422 --> 00:46:34,616
Well, how much?

1114
00:46:36,025 --> 00:46:38,459
I always win at mah-jongg.

1115
00:46:38,527 --> 00:46:39,858
You don't know what you're talking about.

1116
00:46:39,929 --> 00:46:41,362
Besides, who are you going to believe,

1117
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:42,397
me or friends?

1118
00:46:42,465 --> 00:46:44,797
Stepma, I believe you.

1119
00:46:44,867 --> 00:46:46,835
Shut up!

1120
00:46:46,902 --> 00:46:49,166
Did you hear what I told you? Shut up!

1121
00:46:49,238 --> 00:46:50,671
You disobeyed me!

1122
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:53,208
I said absolutely no fighting and no
drinking.

1123
00:46:53,275 --> 00:46:55,743
And above all, no drunken boxing!

1124
00:46:57,213 --> 00:46:59,704
You even fought with me, your own father!

1125
00:46:59,782 --> 00:47:01,807
You disgraced your family name!

1126
00:47:01,884 --> 00:47:03,715
Wait! Wait! Hold on!

1127
00:47:03,786 --> 00:47:04,718
Would you stop hitting him?

1128
00:47:04,787 --> 00:47:06,186
He was just defending me!

1129
00:47:06,255 --> 00:47:07,688
They tried to break my jaw.

1130
00:47:07,757 --> 00:47:09,281
I guess that's something you don't care
about.

1131
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:12,657
Damn you, woman! It was forbidden!

1132
00:47:12,728 --> 00:47:14,787
They could have killed him. Don't you
care about that?

1133
00:47:14,864 --> 00:47:17,697
Oh, sure. Like it matters.

1134
00:47:17,767 --> 00:47:20,861
You're beating him worse than those guys
ever did.

1135
00:47:20,936 --> 00:47:23,700
You're driving me insane!

1136
00:47:25,441 --> 00:47:27,432
I can't believe this!

1137
00:47:33,048 --> 00:47:34,208
What's this?

1138
00:47:34,283 --> 00:47:36,217
Oh, my God!

1139
00:47:36,285 --> 00:47:40,585
What has happened to my 300- year-old
bonsai?

1140
00:47:40,656 --> 00:47:42,283
Damn it! I forgot to throw it out!

1141
00:47:42,358 --> 00:47:43,757
Mr. Cho!

1142
00:47:43,826 --> 00:47:45,726
Aah!

1143
00:47:45,795 --> 00:47:47,695
What went wrong?

1144
00:47:47,763 --> 00:47:50,163
You know this garden is your
responsibility

1145
00:47:50,232 --> 00:47:52,325
and I expect an answer! Well?

1146
00:47:52,401 --> 00:47:54,562
Just hold on!

1147
00:47:54,637 --> 00:47:56,969
You shouldn't blame everything on him
that way,

1148
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:00,008
because I was actually the one who did
it.

1149
00:48:00,075 --> 00:48:02,441
I was practising my kung fu

1150
00:48:02,511 --> 00:48:05,139
and then I tripped over that statue
right over there.

1151
00:48:05,214 --> 00:48:07,409
Luckily, the tree was there to grab.

1152
00:48:07,483 --> 00:48:09,144
God only knows, I could have gotten
killed,

1153
00:48:09,218 --> 00:48:11,516
but I see now you don't care. Oh, well.

1154
00:48:11,587 --> 00:48:13,953
You know that's not it, Ling.

1155
00:48:14,023 --> 00:48:15,718
I am so sick and tired of your deception!

1156
00:48:15,791 --> 00:48:18,521
If you're going to hit me, just go on.

1157
00:48:20,963 --> 00:48:23,761
You know, that's not a bad idea.

1158
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:25,198
It's time you showed me respect.

1159
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,865
That's not gonna work this time!

1160
00:48:34,376 --> 00:48:39,279
You've been hurting me so I won't cause
any more trouble.

1161
00:48:39,348 --> 00:48:40,838
You're driving me out of my mind!

1162
00:48:40,916 --> 00:48:43,476
Aah!

1163
00:48:43,552 --> 00:48:45,986
Hit me! Hit me all right!

1164
00:48:46,055 --> 00:48:47,044
Over the head! Kill me!

1165
00:48:47,122 --> 00:48:48,987
Kill me and the little one inside me!

1166
00:48:49,058 --> 00:48:51,185
Little one?

1167
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,284
Is that so?

1168
00:48:52,361 --> 00:48:53,885
We're going to have a baby?

1169
00:48:55,931 --> 00:48:57,762
Why didn't you tell me?

1170
00:48:57,833 --> 00:48:59,528
Never! - Come inside.

1171
00:48:59,602 --> 00:49:01,661
You told me to get on my knees, so here
I am!

1172
00:49:01,737 --> 00:49:05,468
On my knees! It doesn't matter if I'm
pregnant!

1173
00:49:05,541 --> 00:49:08,772
Mom has a little baby!

1174
00:49:08,844 --> 00:49:10,641
I apologise. I wouldn't hit you.

1175
00:49:10,713 --> 00:49:12,613
Get away! You said enough!

1176
00:49:12,681 --> 00:49:15,047
Ling, no! You will hurt the baby!

1177
00:49:15,117 --> 00:49:17,585
Then put me down! - OK.

1178
00:49:17,653 --> 00:49:18,745
Leave me alone, I said!

1179
00:49:18,821 --> 00:49:21,415
No! You have to stop this!

1180
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:23,048
All right, I will.

1181
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:24,183
Are you all right?

1182
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:25,693
There's no way I'll forgive you!

1183
00:49:25,761 --> 00:49:27,228
What are you doing?

1184
00:49:27,296 --> 00:49:29,787
This is all my fault. Please be careful.

1185
00:49:29,865 --> 00:49:31,264
Get Madam a chair! Quickly!

1186
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:33,130
What are you waiting for?

1187
00:49:33,202 --> 00:49:34,635
I'm begging you, Ling.

1188
00:49:34,703 --> 00:49:36,432
Sit over there, you'll be all right.

1189
00:49:36,505 --> 00:49:39,167
Aah! - Ling!

1190
00:49:39,241 --> 00:49:41,072
Oh! Sorry.

1191
00:49:42,144 --> 00:49:43,338
Ling, I'm so sorry.

1192
00:49:43,412 --> 00:49:44,572
How dare you?!

1193
00:49:44,647 --> 00:49:47,616
Oh, it was an accident, Ling.

1194
00:49:47,683 --> 00:49:48,615
Let me help you.

1195
00:49:48,684 --> 00:49:49,844
You did it on purpose.

1196
00:49:49,919 --> 00:49:51,250
Now, of course I didn't.

1197
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:54,448
Don't lie. Haven't you done enough?

1198
00:49:54,523 --> 00:49:55,547
Is the baby all right?

1199
00:49:55,624 --> 00:49:57,114
Stop it!

1200
00:49:57,192 --> 00:50:00,059
Eee. Ooh. Ugh.

1201
00:50:00,129 --> 00:50:01,528
It's fine.

1202
00:50:01,597 --> 00:50:03,531
Good. Are you comfortable?

1203
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,033
Master Wong, Mrs. . Chan is here.

1204
00:50:06,101 --> 00:50:07,966
She has a bit of a problem.

1205
00:50:08,037 --> 00:50:10,562
You stay right here. I'll be right back.

1206
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:13,767
Congratulations, Father. I'm really
proud of you.

1207
00:50:13,842 --> 00:50:16,606
Thank you.

1208
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:18,340
Ah, Mrs. Chan, it's such a pleasure.

1209
00:50:18,414 --> 00:50:22,510
Dr. Wong, uh, this really isn't ginseng.

1210
00:50:22,584 --> 00:50:25,018
I showed it to another doctor

1211
00:50:25,087 --> 00:50:27,055
and he says it's poisonous.

1212
00:50:27,122 --> 00:50:29,113
Now, I'm not sure where you got it,

1213
00:50:29,191 --> 00:50:30,886
but you've surely been misled.

1214
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,394
It has made my husband deathly ill.

1215
00:50:33,462 --> 00:50:36,397
Mrs. Thank God he only brewed half
of it.

1216
00:50:36,465 --> 00:50:38,990
You owe me, and you're going to have to

1217
00:50:39,068 --> 00:50:42,094
take the blame for this mess. Now!

1218
00:50:42,171 --> 00:50:43,297
Mm-hmm.

1219
00:50:43,372 --> 00:50:46,864
Forgive me. Uncle Ho, get the snake
extract.

1220
00:50:46,942 --> 00:50:48,807
I can assure you he will recover

1221
00:50:48,877 --> 00:50:50,037
if you give him this.

1222
00:50:50,112 --> 00:50:53,081
Ah, Dr. Wong, oh, this is wonderful.

1223
00:50:53,148 --> 00:50:54,775
I promise I won't tell anyone.

1224
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:56,909
It must have been a mistake.

1225
00:50:56,986 --> 00:50:58,419
Good day, madam.

1226
00:50:58,487 --> 00:51:00,717
Mrs. Good day.

1227
00:51:00,789 --> 00:51:02,222
Well?

1228
00:51:02,291 --> 00:51:04,589
Mmm.

1229
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:05,684
Get over here, Cho!

1230
00:51:10,232 --> 00:51:11,164
What's this?

1231
00:51:11,233 --> 00:51:14,964
He did it! Fei-Hong!

1232
00:51:23,412 --> 00:51:25,676
How could you do such a thing?

1233
00:51:25,748 --> 00:51:28,273
Are you out of your mind?

1234
00:51:29,518 --> 00:51:32,009
You are destroying my reputation!

1235
00:51:32,087 --> 00:51:36,922
Here you go, Father. You dropped your
bonsai tree.

1236
00:51:36,992 --> 00:51:39,927
That's it! I'm gonna kill you!

1237
00:51:39,995 --> 00:51:42,725
Ruin me! Drunk!

1238
00:51:42,798 --> 00:51:44,197
Wait, Wong, don't! Aah!

1239
00:51:44,266 --> 00:51:48,032
Hurt my friends! That's it!

1240
00:51:48,103 --> 00:51:50,833
Just listen! It was stolen off the train

1241
00:51:50,906 --> 00:51:52,703
and he couldn't get it back!

1242
00:51:52,775 --> 00:51:55,437
Oh, shit. What am I saying?

1243
00:51:55,511 --> 00:51:57,502
See, he was trying to save you some tax.

1244
00:51:57,579 --> 00:51:59,979
How would he have known the ginseng
would be stolen?

1245
00:52:00,049 --> 00:52:01,983
The ginseng was stolen?

1246
00:52:02,051 --> 00:52:04,349
Even so, he still lied to me!

1247
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:06,581
No! Not acceptable!

1248
00:52:06,655 --> 00:52:08,088
You shouldn't defend him!

1249
00:52:08,157 --> 00:52:10,318
He's a thief and a drunk. Just stay out
of it!

1250
00:52:10,392 --> 00:52:11,324
I'm thirsty.

1251
00:52:11,393 --> 00:52:12,451
Oh, yeah?

1252
00:52:12,528 --> 00:52:16,828
You like some wine? Just stay right
there.

1253
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:27,140
I'll give you some wine. Come on, open
up.

1254
00:52:29,945 --> 00:52:31,936
Come on, drink!

1255
00:52:33,549 --> 00:52:36,484
Stop it, Wong! Stop!

1256
00:52:36,552 --> 00:52:39,146
No more! What are you doing?

1257
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:46,450
Aaah!

1258
00:52:46,528 --> 00:52:48,587
You're going to fight me now?

1259
00:52:48,664 --> 00:52:50,598
I disown you!

1260
00:52:50,666 --> 00:52:53,999
You are not my son!

1261
00:52:54,069 --> 00:52:56,469
Now, get out!

1262
00:52:56,538 --> 00:52:59,098
You better do as I say!

1263
00:52:59,174 --> 00:53:02,371
Get out!

1264
00:53:02,444 --> 00:53:06,141
Come on! Get out of here!

1265
00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:12,109
Stop it! That's enough!

1266
00:53:12,187 --> 00:53:15,384
You're going to kill him!

1267
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:20,392
That's enough, Wong!

1268
00:53:20,462 --> 00:53:23,329
Fei-Hong! Fei-Hong!

1269
00:53:25,167 --> 00:53:29,399
Please, don't! Please!

1270
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:32,338
You're killing him, Wong, can't you see?

1271
00:53:32,407 --> 00:53:35,308
I don't care! I want him out!

1272
00:53:36,378 --> 00:53:37,538
Father!

1273
00:53:39,248 --> 00:53:41,341
Up! Get out of here!

1274
00:53:41,416 --> 00:53:43,043
Aah!

1275
00:53:47,089 --> 00:53:49,853
That was self-defence! He didn't mean to
do it!

1276
00:53:49,925 --> 00:53:51,256
Tell your father you're sorry!

1277
00:53:51,326 --> 00:53:53,226
Out!

1278
00:53:53,295 --> 00:53:54,853
Now!

1279
00:53:55,931 --> 00:53:58,161
Fei-Hong! Come back!

1280
00:53:58,233 --> 00:54:00,463
After him, Cho! Don't let him go!

1281
00:54:05,274 --> 00:54:06,366
Cho!

1282
00:54:08,343 --> 00:54:10,277
That way.

1283
00:54:11,513 --> 00:54:12,673
Oh, yes.

1284
00:54:18,765 --> 00:54:20,357
How many you want?

1285
00:54:20,433 --> 00:54:23,527
Excuse me, sir. Where can I find
the herbal shop?

1286
00:54:23,603 --> 00:54:24,627
Right down on left.

1287
00:54:24,704 --> 00:54:26,194
Thank you. Here you go.

1288
00:54:26,272 --> 00:54:28,172
Hello. Beer, please.

1289
00:54:28,241 --> 00:54:29,765
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.

1290
00:54:32,345 --> 00:54:34,279
I've never seen you drink so much.

1291
00:54:34,347 --> 00:54:35,336
You know your father's going to be

1292
00:54:35,415 --> 00:54:37,975
very angry with you, Fei-Hong.

1293
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:40,644
Let's not talk about this.

1294
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,415
Bring me another drink.

1295
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:43,580
Keep it coming.

1296
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:45,749
Ah, no way. That's it for tonight.

1297
00:54:45,825 --> 00:54:47,292
Ahh.

1298
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:50,352
Excuse me, miss?

1299
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:52,523
I want a song here.

1300
00:54:52,598 --> 00:54:55,260
Something I should sing?

1301
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:58,895
The Ocean's Crying, but I sing it.

1302
00:55:00,573 --> 00:55:02,803
You play for me now?

1303
00:55:02,875 --> 00:55:04,433
OK.

1304
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,480
Mmm.

1305
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:12,677
I am so sent down

1306
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:17,049
I was so happy and now

1307
00:55:17,123 --> 00:55:20,217
I'm all alone with no home

1308
00:55:20,293 --> 00:55:23,091
What can I do?

1309
00:55:23,162 --> 00:55:26,029
If not for the wine

1310
00:55:26,098 --> 00:55:30,432
I'd be hurting all the time

1311
00:55:30,503 --> 00:55:34,872
If only I could go home

1312
00:55:34,941 --> 00:55:38,502
Father, listen to me now

1313
00:55:38,578 --> 00:55:41,775
What can I do to make it up

1314
00:55:41,848 --> 00:55:45,011
To make you proud

1315
00:55:45,084 --> 00:55:48,281
Make you proud

1316
00:55:48,354 --> 00:55:52,017
I only tried to help

1317
00:55:52,091 --> 00:55:54,651
When I saw the bonsai tree

1318
00:55:54,727 --> 00:55:57,924
I thought I was so smart

1319
00:55:57,997 --> 00:55:59,191
Why did you...

1320
00:55:59,265 --> 00:56:01,495
There he is, right over there.

1321
00:56:01,567 --> 00:56:03,125
He doesn't look so bad.

1322
00:56:03,202 --> 00:56:04,635
Oh, yes, he is.

1323
00:56:04,704 --> 00:56:07,468
He's real tough. A fighter.

1324
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:10,202
Well, let's just see about this.

1325
00:56:10,276 --> 00:56:12,210
I still love you

1326
00:56:12,278 --> 00:56:14,872
No matter what you...

1327
00:56:14,947 --> 00:56:17,211
Party's over. I suggest you go.

1328
00:56:17,283 --> 00:56:19,410
No matter what you do

1329
00:56:19,485 --> 00:56:21,146
What? You stop that!

1330
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:23,279
Love you

1331
00:56:23,356 --> 00:56:24,823
You shut up! Listen to me!

1332
00:56:24,891 --> 00:56:27,325
The rest of you, go on home!

1333
00:56:27,393 --> 00:56:28,587
Go on! Get out of here!

1334
00:56:28,661 --> 00:56:30,595
Yeah. You gotta leave.

1335
00:56:30,663 --> 00:56:32,130
Go on. Move!

1336
00:56:32,198 --> 00:56:34,598
Let's get out of the way.

1337
00:56:34,667 --> 00:56:38,068
What happened to the music?

1338
00:56:41,007 --> 00:56:42,474
Oh! - Aah!

1339
00:56:46,245 --> 00:56:47,712
Are you the drunken boxer?

1340
00:56:49,148 --> 00:56:52,276
Sure. I'm pretty drunk,

1341
00:56:52,351 --> 00:56:54,717
but I don't know about boxing.

1342
00:56:54,787 --> 00:56:56,755
He's just faking.

1343
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:01,426
Hyah!

1344
00:57:05,164 --> 00:57:08,930
Come on. What's the matter with
you?

1345
00:57:09,001 --> 00:57:10,593
Get up and fight me!

1346
00:57:12,438 --> 00:57:14,963
That's Fei-Hong.

1347
00:57:15,041 --> 00:57:16,736
Out of my way! What are you doing?

1348
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:17,741
Hey.

1349
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:19,209
It's none of your goddam business.

1350
00:57:21,347 --> 00:57:22,314
Aah!

1351
00:57:25,051 --> 00:57:26,313
Get him out!

1352
00:57:26,385 --> 00:57:30,014
What's going on? Is this some kind of
joke?

1353
00:57:30,089 --> 00:57:32,114
No! You should have seen him!

1354
00:57:32,191 --> 00:57:34,250
He couldn't be stopped. Ask anyone.

1355
00:57:34,327 --> 00:57:36,124
I'll stop him.

1356
00:57:41,701 --> 00:57:43,498
We finished him!

1357
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:49,467
Ha ha! Why you kick me?

1358
00:57:49,542 --> 00:57:53,535
Look at you. Get up and fight me! Come
on!

1359
00:57:53,613 --> 00:57:56,446
Get this drunk out of my sight!

1360
00:57:56,515 --> 00:57:58,278
Go! Go on! Kill him!

1361
00:57:58,351 --> 00:58:00,512
No, wait. Not yet.

1362
00:58:00,586 --> 00:58:03,885
Don't kill him, teach him a lesson.

1363
00:58:03,956 --> 00:58:05,719
All right, you've had it now.

1364
00:58:05,791 --> 00:58:07,053
Careful, he's tricky!

1365
00:58:10,363 --> 00:58:11,625
Fei-Hong.

1366
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:12,959
He's hurt bad, yeah.

1367
00:58:14,066 --> 00:58:15,033
Girl: Come.

1368
00:58:15,101 --> 00:58:17,934
Ooh, that's bad. Let's go.

1369
00:58:18,004 --> 00:58:19,266
Oh, God.

1370
00:58:22,108 --> 00:58:23,439
Fei-Hong!

1371
00:58:26,912 --> 00:58:27,879
Up there!

1372
00:58:27,947 --> 00:58:28,879
Wang!

1373
00:58:32,451 --> 00:58:35,887
Get him! Cut him down!

1374
00:58:45,277 --> 00:58:48,212
Fei-Hong, don't be ashamed.

1375
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:52,683
When we were kids, we used to go naked
all the time.

1376
00:58:52,751 --> 00:58:55,015
I should have found you sooner.

1377
00:58:55,087 --> 00:58:58,386
You'll be OK. Just give it some time.

1378
00:59:00,425 --> 00:59:01,858
By the way...

1379
00:59:01,927 --> 00:59:04,157
I have some good news, too.

1380
00:59:04,229 --> 00:59:07,790
Just listen to me. Guess what.

1381
00:59:07,866 --> 00:59:10,699
Every woman in town wants to be your
wife.

1382
00:59:10,769 --> 00:59:12,532
It's the truth.

1383
00:59:12,604 --> 00:59:15,596
Hey, all right. Come on.

1384
00:59:15,674 --> 00:59:17,505
Dry your eyes.

1385
00:59:17,576 --> 00:59:19,510
Father...

1386
00:59:19,578 --> 00:59:20,567
I know.

1387
00:59:23,015 --> 00:59:25,848
I have a good reason to forbid drunken
boxing.

1388
00:59:25,917 --> 00:59:29,182
Those who practice it frequently wind up
as alcoholics.

1389
00:59:29,254 --> 00:59:31,620
Not if one uses restraint and self-
discipline.

1390
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:33,851
But that's more difficult than you might
think.

1391
00:59:33,925 --> 00:59:37,952
It's true that alcohol can make
the body loose

1392
00:59:38,030 --> 00:59:39,497
and its pain threshold higher,

1393
00:59:39,564 --> 00:59:42,829
but it's difficult to drink the proper
amount.

1394
00:59:42,901 --> 00:59:45,165
Many drunken boxers become nothing more

1395
00:59:45,237 --> 00:59:47,205
than drunken fools.

1396
00:59:47,272 --> 00:59:49,103
The odds of bringing shame and disgrace

1397
00:59:49,174 --> 00:59:52,337
upon oneself and one's family is just
too great.

1398
00:59:52,411 --> 00:59:55,039
It also reminds me there is an ancient
proverb

1399
00:59:55,113 --> 00:59:57,946
that equates the drinking of alcohol
with water-

1400
00:59:58,016 --> 01:00:01,349
"Boats can float on water, " or so it
says,

1401
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:03,320
"but they can sink in it, too. "

1402
01:00:03,388 --> 01:00:04,946
Now, that's a profound lesson.

1403
01:00:05,023 --> 01:00:06,456
I have only one question.

1404
01:00:06,525 --> 01:00:07,457
What?

1405
01:00:07,526 --> 01:00:09,050
Whose boat are we talking about?

1406
01:00:27,579 --> 01:00:29,706
I will never drink again.

1407
01:00:39,224 --> 01:00:41,954
Ah, there, there, Fei-Hong.

1408
01:00:42,027 --> 01:00:43,858
I'm glad to see that you're OK now.

1409
01:00:43,929 --> 01:00:45,863
Come on, let's get up and thank all your
friends here

1410
01:00:45,931 --> 01:00:47,899
for helping you. Go on.

1411
01:00:47,966 --> 01:00:49,900
Ho Sang: Fei-Hong, you OK?

1412
01:00:49,968 --> 01:00:52,664
Thank you.

1413
01:00:52,738 --> 01:00:55,036
You OK?

1414
01:00:55,107 --> 01:00:56,540
You should...

1415
01:00:56,608 --> 01:00:58,872
Don't ever give up. You'll be
better now.

1416
01:00:58,944 --> 01:01:00,343
Everybody makes mistakes.

1417
01:01:00,412 --> 01:01:01,845
How's the baby today?

1418
01:01:01,913 --> 01:01:03,744
He's just fine. Let him be.

1419
01:01:03,815 --> 01:01:06,340
Oh. All right.

1420
01:01:22,734 --> 01:01:24,258
Sorry, we are closed now.

1421
01:01:25,637 --> 01:01:27,571
Where's Fei-Hong?

1422
01:01:27,639 --> 01:01:28,628
Excuse me?

1423
01:01:28,707 --> 01:01:29,901
Is he here?

1424
01:01:29,975 --> 01:01:31,772
He might be. What for?

1425
01:01:31,843 --> 01:01:33,333
It's private.

1426
01:01:34,646 --> 01:01:36,204
May I come in?

1427
01:01:37,749 --> 01:01:39,740
Well, in that case...

1428
01:01:41,887 --> 01:01:43,821
I know who sent you.

1429
01:01:43,889 --> 01:01:47,052
What was that for? Keep your distance.

1430
01:01:47,125 --> 01:01:49,320
That's enough. I want you to leave.

1431
01:01:57,669 --> 01:01:58,931
Hmm.

1432
01:02:00,372 --> 01:02:02,033
You know, you're not bad.

1433
01:02:14,853 --> 01:02:16,184
Huh? It's you!

1434
01:02:16,254 --> 01:02:17,186
You!

1435
01:02:17,255 --> 01:02:19,223
Fei-Hong, hold him for me!

1436
01:02:19,291 --> 01:02:21,282
Unh!

1437
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:22,724
Help.

1438
01:02:26,932 --> 01:02:28,365
Father, help!

1439
01:02:28,433 --> 01:02:30,196
Help him! - That's enough!

1440
01:02:30,268 --> 01:02:32,236
Hurting me! Aah!

1441
01:02:32,304 --> 01:02:34,169
Fei-Hong, are you all right?

1442
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,797
Yeah, I was just pretending.

1443
01:02:35,874 --> 01:02:36,863
Fei-Hong, who is that?

1444
01:02:42,948 --> 01:02:43,880
Hey!

1445
01:02:43,949 --> 01:02:45,678
Fei-Hong, hold it!

1446
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:47,650
We have you surrounded!

1447
01:02:47,719 --> 01:02:49,152
I'm talking to you.

1448
01:02:49,221 --> 01:02:50,984
Yeah. Would you stop?

1449
01:02:51,056 --> 01:02:52,489
Me?

1450
01:02:52,557 --> 01:02:53,785
Please, sir, I hope you can
forgive us.

1451
01:02:53,859 --> 01:02:56,521
I am Wong Kei-Ying. I apologise.

1452
01:02:56,595 --> 01:02:59,393
You are very famous. Meeting you is an
honour.

1453
01:02:59,464 --> 01:03:01,762
I am Fu Wen-Chi.

1454
01:03:01,833 --> 01:03:03,698
Fu Wen-Chi?

1455
01:03:03,768 --> 01:03:05,463
Our most decorated Manchu officer.

1456
01:03:05,537 --> 01:03:07,300
Is it true?

1457
01:03:07,372 --> 01:03:08,964
Yes, it is.

1458
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,302
It's an honour. Welcome.

1459
01:03:10,375 --> 01:03:12,275
Right this way. - Thank you.

1460
01:03:12,344 --> 01:03:14,369
Good evening.

1461
01:03:14,446 --> 01:03:16,778
I guess that man is someone important.

1462
01:03:16,848 --> 01:03:18,782
Trust me, if he was important,

1463
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:21,250
he wouldn't be hitting women, would he?

1464
01:03:21,319 --> 01:03:22,251
Oh.

1465
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,878
Think about it.

1466
01:03:23,955 --> 01:03:24,887
What?

1467
01:03:24,956 --> 01:03:26,685
Keep searching. We have to find it.

1468
01:03:26,758 --> 01:03:27,918
Look in the parlour when you're done.

1469
01:03:27,993 --> 01:03:28,925
Yes, ma'am.

1470
01:03:28,994 --> 01:03:30,791
You have no idea where you left it?

1471
01:03:30,862 --> 01:03:33,160
No, I don't.

1472
01:03:33,231 --> 01:03:34,698
Where could it be?

1473
01:03:34,766 --> 01:03:36,427
Cho might know.

1474
01:03:38,303 --> 01:03:39,463
Hey!

1475
01:03:39,538 --> 01:03:40,766
Something's wrong?

1476
01:03:40,839 --> 01:03:44,570
Oh, it's hot tonight. I can't stand it.

1477
01:03:44,643 --> 01:03:46,873
She's quite a handful.

1478
01:03:46,945 --> 01:03:50,039
Oh, think I'll get some ice.

1479
01:03:50,115 --> 01:03:52,174
Cho, where's the jade box I had?

1480
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:53,274
What?

1481
01:03:53,351 --> 01:03:54,909
Where did you put it?

1482
01:03:54,986 --> 01:03:56,476
I don't know.

1483
01:03:56,555 --> 01:03:57,487
What is that?

1484
01:03:57,556 --> 01:03:59,319
Ground garlic.

1485
01:03:59,391 --> 01:04:01,382
I mean there in your hand.

1486
01:04:03,828 --> 01:04:05,523
We found it!

1487
01:04:05,597 --> 01:04:06,962
Fei-Hong, where are you going?

1488
01:04:07,032 --> 01:04:08,829
Mom! - I'm not finished with that.

1489
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:10,993
Fu: When you surprised me in the baggage
car,

1490
01:04:11,069 --> 01:04:12,730
I was trying to get back thejade seal

1491
01:04:12,804 --> 01:04:15,170
that Ambassador Morley had stolen.

1492
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:17,299
I wound up with your ginseng instead.

1493
01:04:17,375 --> 01:04:19,138
Tell me something,

1494
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:21,508
there must be a hundred jade seals in
our museum.

1495
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:22,740
Is this one so special?

1496
01:04:22,814 --> 01:04:25,749
Fei-Hong, they all are special.

1497
01:04:25,817 --> 01:04:27,512
Think about this.

1498
01:04:27,586 --> 01:04:29,611
Today they plunder a seal.

1499
01:04:29,688 --> 01:04:31,588
It seems small.

1500
01:04:31,656 --> 01:04:34,181
Tomorrow they take another, and the next
thing you know,

1501
01:04:34,259 --> 01:04:38,059
the Great Wall is gone. And what's next?

1502
01:04:38,129 --> 01:04:42,589
Our children must travel abroad just to
see their history.

1503
01:04:42,667 --> 01:04:45,830
So, don't you see that you and I

1504
01:04:45,904 --> 01:04:48,873
are the only possible defence

1505
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:51,932
from governments trying to strip us of
our culture?

1506
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:53,307
So, I hope you can help me do this,

1507
01:04:53,378 --> 01:04:57,337
if only for the future generations of
our people.

1508
01:04:57,415 --> 01:05:00,976
All right. I'll be honoured to help.

1509
01:05:01,052 --> 01:05:02,713
Thank you, Fei-Hong.

1510
01:05:05,123 --> 01:05:08,024
It's awfully quiet all of a sudden.

1511
01:05:08,093 --> 01:05:09,082
Where is everyone?

1512
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:10,889
Yeah. There's no one here.

1513
01:05:12,263 --> 01:05:13,628
I'll go take a look.

1514
01:05:17,869 --> 01:05:19,200
What the...

1515
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:20,897
Yaah!

1516
01:05:22,574 --> 01:05:26,101
Aah! - Aah!

1517
01:05:26,177 --> 01:05:28,668
Let's go! Let's go! Move!

1518
01:05:31,049 --> 01:05:32,346
Uh-oh.

1519
01:05:32,417 --> 01:05:34,214
What do we do?

1520
01:05:34,285 --> 01:05:35,582
Follow me.

1521
01:05:41,292 --> 01:05:42,554
Here I go!

1522
01:05:49,501 --> 01:05:50,695
Get him!

1523
01:06:23,368 --> 01:06:24,630
Huh?

1524
01:06:32,777 --> 01:06:34,210
All right, lift it!

1525
01:06:41,152 --> 01:06:42,449
Fu: Here, Fei-Hong!

1526
01:06:47,158 --> 01:06:48,313
Let's go!

1527
01:07:02,994 --> 01:07:05,519
Aah! - Aah!

1528
01:07:05,597 --> 01:07:07,758
Oh, they started.

1529
01:07:07,833 --> 01:07:09,733
Oh, I see the fun's begun.

1530
01:07:09,801 --> 01:07:11,428
Sounds great.

1531
01:07:11,503 --> 01:07:14,336
When you have the Ax Gang, you're sure
to get the job done.

1532
01:07:14,406 --> 01:07:16,101
That's what we're paying for.

1533
01:07:22,114 --> 01:07:24,708
Fei-Hong, here!

1534
01:07:24,783 --> 01:07:25,772
Hai!

1535
01:08:08,326 --> 01:08:09,418
Unh!

1536
01:08:13,665 --> 01:08:15,690
Huh? - Fu: Fei-Hong!

1537
01:08:21,306 --> 01:08:22,967
Oh, my God! No!

1538
01:08:25,277 --> 01:08:26,369
Aah!

1539
01:08:34,686 --> 01:08:36,449
Hai! Yaah!

1540
01:08:37,522 --> 01:08:42,016
Fei-Hong! Your shirt, take it off!

1541
01:08:42,093 --> 01:08:43,583
OK!

1542
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:32,536
Quickly, now, go! - This way!

1543
01:09:32,611 --> 01:09:34,841
Go! Go! Move it!

1544
01:09:40,485 --> 01:09:41,645
Run! Go on!

1545
01:09:48,894 --> 01:09:52,057
What's this? What's going on?

1546
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:53,256
Don't get involved.

1547
01:09:54,966 --> 01:09:56,228
Get on out of here.

1548
01:09:56,301 --> 01:09:57,598
Now. Go on.

1549
01:09:57,669 --> 01:09:58,601
Help.

1550
01:09:58,670 --> 01:10:00,103
That's Fu Wen-Chi!

1551
01:10:00,171 --> 01:10:02,571
Unh!

1552
01:10:08,747 --> 01:10:10,271
Ow! That hurt!

1553
01:10:15,453 --> 01:10:16,852
Hey! -

1554
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:20,448
Fu Wen-Chi!

1555
01:10:21,626 --> 01:10:22,650
There! - Master Fu!

1556
01:10:22,727 --> 01:10:25,161
Huh? Come on! Let's go!

1557
01:10:27,198 --> 01:10:28,130
Master Fu!

1558
01:10:28,199 --> 01:10:31,498
Get behind! - Help! Help!

1559
01:10:31,570 --> 01:10:35,563
Aah! - Easy, easy!

1560
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,107
Try to stop the bleeding.

1561
01:10:37,175 --> 01:10:38,369
Don't die!

1562
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:39,933
Hold on! Master Fu!

1563
01:10:40,011 --> 01:10:41,808
We'll go for a doctor! You'll be all
right!

1564
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,541
The royal seal...

1565
01:10:43,615 --> 01:10:45,048
I know. We'll get it.

1566
01:10:45,116 --> 01:10:46,242
Don't worry. I'll find it.

1567
01:10:46,318 --> 01:10:49,253
The embassy. Go quickly.

1568
01:10:49,321 --> 01:10:50,754
What do I do? - Tonight.

1569
01:10:50,822 --> 01:10:53,757
Hold on, Master. My father will take
care of you.

1570
01:10:53,825 --> 01:10:56,385
I promise. Don't give up!

1571
01:10:57,963 --> 01:11:00,454
No, Master Fu! Come on!

1572
01:11:03,868 --> 01:11:07,360
What are you thinking?

1573
01:11:07,439 --> 01:11:09,304
Nothing!

1574
01:11:37,769 --> 01:11:39,669
May I give you a light?

1575
01:11:39,738 --> 01:11:43,572
Hold this, please. Thanks very much.

1576
01:11:43,642 --> 01:11:45,667
There you are.

1577
01:11:52,651 --> 01:11:54,585
Carry on.

1578
01:12:05,497 --> 01:12:07,260
Pick it up. What's wrong with you?

1579
01:12:27,619 --> 01:12:29,052
Chang Tsan? - Fei-Hong?

1580
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,645
Come on! You almost killed me!

1581
01:12:31,723 --> 01:12:33,486
What are you doing here?

1582
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:34,650
Me? What are you doing here? Come on.

1583
01:12:37,729 --> 01:12:38,753
I got him.

1584
01:12:40,365 --> 01:12:41,764
So, where's the seal?

1585
01:12:41,833 --> 01:12:43,130
How should I know? Let's go.

1586
01:12:43,201 --> 01:12:45,135
Here.

1587
01:12:45,203 --> 01:12:46,602
Thanks.

1588
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,701
Anybody see you?

1589
01:12:50,775 --> 01:12:53,608
No. I can't see. You got a light?

1590
01:12:53,678 --> 01:12:56,146
Of course. Hold it.

1591
01:13:01,886 --> 01:13:03,319
Down.

1592
01:13:29,447 --> 01:13:31,540
Ambassador: Looking for something?

1593
01:13:33,885 --> 01:13:35,978
Is this what brought you here?

1594
01:13:36,054 --> 01:13:38,284
Kneel!

1595
01:13:38,356 --> 01:13:40,017
Ambassador: I hope you don't mind.

1596
01:13:40,091 --> 01:13:43,117
We've taken the liberty to document your
stay

1597
01:13:43,194 --> 01:13:46,027
at our magnificent embassy.

1598
01:13:46,097 --> 01:13:47,462
Please do enjoy our hospitality.

1599
01:13:47,532 --> 01:13:49,898
You can go straight to hell!

1600
01:14:04,916 --> 01:14:06,213
That's enough! Over!

1601
01:14:06,284 --> 01:14:07,842
A winner.

1602
01:14:07,919 --> 01:14:10,149
That'll be all, gentlemen.

1603
01:14:10,221 --> 01:14:12,052
We'll continue the plan as scheduled.

1604
01:14:12,123 --> 01:14:13,181
Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

1605
01:14:13,258 --> 01:14:14,782
Thank you.

1606
01:14:19,931 --> 01:14:21,865
Things have worked out rather well

1607
01:14:21,933 --> 01:14:23,764
now that we have the jade seal back

1608
01:14:23,835 --> 01:14:26,633
and a way to acquire Po Chi Lam.

1609
01:14:26,704 --> 01:14:28,797
That's right. I've already sent

1610
01:14:28,873 --> 01:14:31,501
the embassy photographs of Fei-Hong and
his friend

1611
01:14:31,576 --> 01:14:34,067
to Master Wong.

1612
01:14:34,145 --> 01:14:36,477
He'll sell just like I told you.

1613
01:14:36,548 --> 01:14:37,606
He has no choice.

1614
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:40,344
Make sure he understands, John,

1615
01:14:40,418 --> 01:14:43,012
that we expect him to vacate the Po Chi
Lam immediately,

1616
01:14:43,087 --> 01:14:45,740
or we'll plan to execute Fei-Hong.

1617
01:14:45,874 --> 01:14:47,068
Oh!

1618
01:14:47,142 --> 01:14:48,734
Damn those boys!

1619
01:14:48,810 --> 01:14:51,040
Don't they understand there's nothing we
can do?

1620
01:14:51,112 --> 01:14:53,740
As an embassy, they're exempt from the
laws of China.

1621
01:14:53,815 --> 01:14:55,680
Maybe we can reason with them. I'll go.

1622
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:58,184
Sit down! You know what they want-

1623
01:14:58,253 --> 01:15:00,551
the rights to Po Chi Lam!

1624
01:15:00,622 --> 01:15:02,487
They just wanted to return the seal.

1625
01:15:02,557 --> 01:15:03,888
They aren't the criminals.

1626
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:05,448
You spoiled him! - You disowned him!

1627
01:15:05,527 --> 01:15:07,461
- This is all your fault! - This is all
your fault!

1628
01:15:07,529 --> 01:15:09,258
You're impossible.

1629
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:11,230
And you're his father.

1630
01:15:11,299 --> 01:15:13,961
We're running out of time. We've got to
do something.

1631
01:15:14,035 --> 01:15:14,967
You're right.

1632
01:15:15,036 --> 01:15:17,129
I refuse.

1633
01:15:17,205 --> 01:15:18,638
How can I?

1634
01:15:18,706 --> 01:15:21,698
You know this land has been in our
family for centuries.

1635
01:15:21,776 --> 01:15:24,142
There has always been a school here.

1636
01:15:24,212 --> 01:15:26,908
What would you do, just give it up?

1637
01:15:26,981 --> 01:15:29,415
I'll never do it.

1638
01:15:29,484 --> 01:15:31,418
Oh, really? What would his mother have
done?

1639
01:15:31,486 --> 01:15:32,817
I bet I know!

1640
01:15:36,558 --> 01:15:40,688
Sister, I need your wisdom

1641
01:15:40,762 --> 01:15:43,162
more than ever.

1642
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:45,529
What can we do for Fei-Hong?

1643
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,034
Can you help us?

1644
01:15:58,446 --> 01:15:59,378
Release them.

1645
01:15:59,447 --> 01:16:01,381
You may let them go.

1646
01:16:11,659 --> 01:16:13,559
You OK?

1647
01:16:13,628 --> 01:16:16,358
Just go on.

1648
01:16:16,431 --> 01:16:18,126
Tsan.

1649
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:19,131
I'm grateful.

1650
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:22,135
Are you hurt? OK.

1651
01:16:23,238 --> 01:16:24,899
Just look at you.

1652
01:16:24,973 --> 01:16:27,965
I'm gonna be all right.

1653
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:29,509
Madam Wong.

1654
01:16:29,577 --> 01:16:31,169
Are you OK, Master?

1655
01:16:31,246 --> 01:16:33,043
Some bruises, but I'll be fine.

1656
01:16:33,114 --> 01:16:34,638
So, what will we do now?

1657
01:16:34,716 --> 01:16:35,910
What do you mean?

1658
01:16:35,984 --> 01:16:38,248
Master Wong has sold the school to the
embassy.

1659
01:16:38,319 --> 01:16:40,184
He did what?!

1660
01:16:40,255 --> 01:16:41,244
How could that be?

1661
01:16:41,322 --> 01:16:43,517
Don't you see? They made him sell it.

1662
01:16:43,591 --> 01:16:45,525
He had to or they would kill you both.

1663
01:16:45,593 --> 01:16:47,959
You're just lucky to be alive.

1664
01:16:48,029 --> 01:16:51,692
Fei-Hong, this fight is over.

1665
01:16:51,766 --> 01:16:53,825
We can't do this anymore.

1666
01:16:53,902 --> 01:16:55,563
I hope you know your father has
sacrificed everything.

1667
01:16:55,637 --> 01:16:59,403
I wish that they had killed me.

1668
01:16:59,474 --> 01:17:02,534
Now, Fei-Hong, that is enough.

1669
01:17:02,610 --> 01:17:05,636
Life's changes are like a moving river.

1670
01:17:05,713 --> 01:17:08,443
What's here today is gone tomorrow

1671
01:17:08,516 --> 01:17:10,780
and tomorrow brings a whole new journey.

1672
01:17:10,852 --> 01:17:12,979
Let's move forward and live.

1673
01:17:17,992 --> 01:17:21,894
So, when will the ship be leaving?

1674
01:17:21,963 --> 01:17:23,089
This Tuesday.

1675
01:17:23,164 --> 01:17:25,428
Hmm. And everything's ready?

1676
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:27,525
Yes, sir. Ready and waiting, sir.

1677
01:17:27,602 --> 01:17:28,796
Good, good.

1678
01:17:28,870 --> 01:17:31,395
I want to close down the factory, lay
off the workers,

1679
01:17:31,472 --> 01:17:33,406
and transport the shipment to Hong Kong.

1680
01:17:33,474 --> 01:17:34,907
Pick it up.

1681
01:17:34,976 --> 01:17:36,739
Yes, sir.

1682
01:17:41,683 --> 01:17:43,981
First we work overtime!

1683
01:17:44,052 --> 01:17:46,213
We refuse, then they beat us!

1684
01:17:46,287 --> 01:17:48,187
Chin: And now they think they can fire
all of us

1685
01:17:48,256 --> 01:17:49,450
just like that!

1686
01:17:49,524 --> 01:17:52,755
So, are you guys going to let him get
away with that?

1687
01:17:52,827 --> 01:17:54,590
What do you say, huh?

1688
01:17:54,662 --> 01:17:57,028
Chang Tsan, what's going on?

1689
01:17:57,098 --> 01:17:59,259
They closed the mill, and you know what?

1690
01:17:59,334 --> 01:18:00,767
It was English ambassador

1691
01:18:00,835 --> 01:18:03,702
who was in charge of doing it.

1692
01:18:03,771 --> 01:18:06,035
Sounds like trouble. I don't think I can
help you.

1693
01:18:06,107 --> 01:18:08,837
Oh, sure. You didn't lose your job.

1694
01:18:08,910 --> 01:18:11,003
Well, I'm not gonna let them push us
around.

1695
01:18:11,079 --> 01:18:12,546
Yeah. As soon as they finished the last
shipment,

1696
01:18:12,613 --> 01:18:14,103
they fired all the men.

1697
01:18:14,182 --> 01:18:17,151
And you think they have something to do
with it?

1698
01:18:17,218 --> 01:18:19,686
I don't know, but I'm going to find out
for sure.

1699
01:18:19,754 --> 01:18:21,585
Let me think what it could be.

1700
01:18:21,656 --> 01:18:23,419
We should check the office.

1701
01:18:23,491 --> 01:18:26,858
Fei-Hong, could that be it?

1702
01:18:26,928 --> 01:18:28,793
Well, we know they're up to something.

1703
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:31,127
Find a way into the factory. - OK.

1704
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:32,723
Then we'll find a way to stop them.

1705
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,597
Let's go.

1706
01:18:47,382 --> 01:18:49,145
Chin: What... What's this?

1707
01:18:49,217 --> 01:18:52,448
My God! Look what they're doing!

1708
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:54,920
Well, we've got to stop them.

1709
01:18:54,989 --> 01:18:56,081
I'll tell Fei-Hong.

1710
01:18:56,157 --> 01:18:57,089
Hurry, Ho Sang!

1711
01:18:58,159 --> 01:19:00,024
In a hurry?

1712
01:19:00,094 --> 01:19:01,186
Sorry.

1713
01:19:02,997 --> 01:19:04,157
Aah!

1714
01:19:04,232 --> 01:19:05,893
Let go!

1715
01:19:05,967 --> 01:19:08,435
Aah!

1716
01:19:16,811 --> 01:19:18,904
Unh!

1717
01:19:28,656 --> 01:19:30,624
Chin: Go get help!

1718
01:19:36,531 --> 01:19:38,226
Ho Sang, this way!

1719
01:19:38,299 --> 01:19:40,062
No. I've got to tell Fei-Hong.

1720
01:19:41,903 --> 01:19:44,133
Get out of here!

1721
01:19:44,205 --> 01:19:45,194
Get them!

1722
01:19:49,143 --> 01:19:50,303
Bring Fei-Hong!

1723
01:19:51,512 --> 01:19:52,444
Go now!

1724
01:19:52,513 --> 01:19:53,946
Yaah!

1725
01:20:02,023 --> 01:20:03,547
Yaah!

1726
01:20:08,396 --> 01:20:10,227
Shit!

1727
01:20:11,933 --> 01:20:14,800
Madam, they're coming out.

1728
01:20:14,869 --> 01:20:17,463
All right, keep it down.

1729
01:20:17,538 --> 01:20:18,971
Then we can organise.

1730
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,974
A good idea. Good day.

1731
01:20:21,042 --> 01:20:22,236
Goodbye. Have a safe trip.

1732
01:20:22,310 --> 01:20:23,777
Take care of the baby.

1733
01:20:23,845 --> 01:20:25,938
I will.

1734
01:20:26,013 --> 01:20:28,538
Fei-Hong?

1735
01:20:28,616 --> 01:20:29,583
Yes, Father?

1736
01:20:29,650 --> 01:20:31,208
Don't get up. Keep working.

1737
01:20:31,285 --> 01:20:32,547
Are you almost through with that?

1738
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:34,451
Almost finished.

1739
01:20:34,522 --> 01:20:36,490
Then start another one.

1740
01:20:36,557 --> 01:20:39,082
I'll make sure he does. It's my
responsibility.

1741
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:40,923
He's not allowed to leave. You
understand me?

1742
01:20:40,995 --> 01:20:42,360
Perfectly.

1743
01:20:42,430 --> 01:20:43,761
All right. Good.

1744
01:20:45,299 --> 01:20:46,459
You know, dear,

1745
01:20:46,534 --> 01:20:48,661
I've been thinking about names for the
baby.

1746
01:20:48,736 --> 01:20:51,796
If we were to have a boy, he could be
Wong Tei-Pau.

1747
01:20:51,873 --> 01:20:53,841
If it's a girl, Wong Pei.

1748
01:20:53,908 --> 01:20:55,432
Nice. Both names are fine.

1749
01:20:55,510 --> 01:20:57,637
But do we really need to pick one now?

1750
01:20:57,712 --> 01:20:58,644
What if I'm early?

1751
01:20:58,713 --> 01:21:00,044
That shouldn't be a problem

1752
01:21:00,114 --> 01:21:01,706
if you take it easy till I get back.

1753
01:21:01,782 --> 01:21:02,646
Of course.

1754
01:21:02,717 --> 01:21:04,685
Fei-Hong? - Yes?

1755
01:21:04,752 --> 01:21:05,719
Water the plants.

1756
01:21:05,786 --> 01:21:07,219
I will!

1757
01:21:07,288 --> 01:21:09,518
Hold on! I've got to go.

1758
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:11,387
Remember, get lots of rest.

1759
01:21:11,459 --> 01:21:13,222
We'll be fine. Don't worry.

1760
01:21:13,294 --> 01:21:14,318
Fei-Hong and I will be just fine.

1761
01:21:14,395 --> 01:21:16,761
Go! We don't have any time to spare!

1762
01:21:16,831 --> 01:21:18,594
Hurry!

1763
01:21:21,202 --> 01:21:23,693
We've got to get Chin out of there.

1764
01:21:23,771 --> 01:21:25,432
I hope he's still alive.

1765
01:21:25,506 --> 01:21:26,939
What can we do?

1766
01:21:27,008 --> 01:21:28,942
I'm going to stop them. I'm going to do
what I can!

1767
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:31,672
I gave my promise to Fu and Chin!

1768
01:21:31,746 --> 01:21:34,044
What do you think?

1769
01:21:34,115 --> 01:21:35,047
Let's go.

1770
01:21:35,116 --> 01:21:37,846
Hey, wait, where are you going?

1771
01:21:37,919 --> 01:21:38,908
I'm going to battle!

1772
01:21:38,986 --> 01:21:40,010
But...

1773
01:21:40,087 --> 01:21:41,884
Wait, madam, you can't go in your
condition.

1774
01:21:41,956 --> 01:21:45,517
What condition? Come on, I'm only
pregnant.

1775
01:21:45,593 --> 01:21:49,029
Oh, madam, please. Think about the baby.

1776
01:21:49,096 --> 01:21:51,860
What if something were to happen?

1777
01:21:51,933 --> 01:21:53,764
You're right. Go ahead without me, then.

1778
01:21:53,834 --> 01:21:56,428
I'll go get my students. Meet me at the
mill.

1779
01:21:56,504 --> 01:21:58,335
Right. I'll gather up the men.

1780
01:21:58,406 --> 01:22:00,499
Oh, thanks, Fei-Hong.

1781
01:22:00,575 --> 01:22:04,033
You're with us, right? Yeah, OK.

1782
01:22:04,111 --> 01:22:05,669
Will you be all right, madam?

1783
01:22:05,746 --> 01:22:07,373
I'll be fine. - Good.

1784
01:22:07,448 --> 01:22:08,915
But what if Father finds out?

1785
01:22:08,983 --> 01:22:11,315
Oh, go on. Who cares now what your
father thinks?

1786
01:22:11,385 --> 01:22:12,750
Only make me proud.

1787
01:22:12,820 --> 01:22:14,754
I will. OK.

1788
01:22:14,822 --> 01:22:17,086
Oh! Fei-Hong! - Yeah?

1789
01:22:17,158 --> 01:22:19,558
Something for good luck.

1790
01:22:22,096 --> 01:22:23,586
I can use it.

1791
01:22:25,967 --> 01:22:29,403
We demand justice! We demand
justice!

1792
01:22:29,470 --> 01:22:33,429
We demand justice! We demand justice!

1793
01:22:34,942 --> 01:22:37,172
Guards: Get back! Get back!

1794
01:23:02,619 --> 01:23:04,109
You step aside now!

1795
01:23:04,187 --> 01:23:06,451
We demand justice! We know what you have
in there!

1796
01:23:06,523 --> 01:23:07,990
Back off!

1797
01:23:08,058 --> 01:23:09,116
Those antiques are not yours,

1798
01:23:09,192 --> 01:23:10,124
and we won't let them out of China!

1799
01:23:10,193 --> 01:23:11,683
You have no right to them.

1800
01:23:11,762 --> 01:23:13,889
Is that right?

1801
01:23:19,836 --> 01:23:21,167
Charge!

1802
01:23:28,278 --> 01:23:30,212
No! No guns!

1803
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:32,407
Kill them all!

1804
01:23:53,003 --> 01:23:57,702
Fei-Hong, you've got to rescue jade now.

1805
01:24:05,182 --> 01:24:07,673
Get back! - Stand back!

1806
01:24:30,941 --> 01:24:33,569
Unh! Come on!

1807
01:24:33,643 --> 01:24:35,702
Yaah! - Wait!

1808
01:24:45,822 --> 01:24:47,312
Come on!

1809
01:24:58,468 --> 01:24:59,730
One hand!

1810
01:26:24,254 --> 01:26:26,779
Here's water!

1811
01:26:26,856 --> 01:26:28,255
Thanks.

1812
01:26:32,395 --> 01:26:33,953
No! - Yaah!

1813
01:26:35,065 --> 01:26:37,260
Wait!

1814
01:26:37,334 --> 01:26:38,266
You gotta find jade.

1815
01:26:38,335 --> 01:26:39,597
Let's go!

1816
01:26:39,669 --> 01:26:42,365
Yeah. Let's go.

1817
01:26:42,439 --> 01:26:46,000
Boss! Boss! Boss!

1818
01:26:46,076 --> 01:26:47,976
Boss!

1819
01:26:48,044 --> 01:26:49,875
Boss! Boss!

1820
01:26:49,946 --> 01:26:51,379
What happened?

1821
01:26:51,448 --> 01:26:54,246
That drunken guy is here! We got to do
something!

1822
01:26:54,317 --> 01:26:56,148
All right, get him!

1823
01:27:08,098 --> 01:27:09,190
Won't this be fun.

1824
01:27:14,304 --> 01:27:16,067
Wait!

1825
01:27:16,139 --> 01:27:18,369
Do you realise what you're doing?

1826
01:27:18,441 --> 01:27:21,035
You're helping them steal our history,
our culture.

1827
01:27:22,412 --> 01:27:24,471
You mean these?

1828
01:27:24,547 --> 01:27:26,071
They're of no use to anyone.

1829
01:27:26,149 --> 01:27:28,208
If they want to buy them, I'll gladly
sell.

1830
01:27:28,284 --> 01:27:29,308
I won't let you do it.

1831
01:27:29,386 --> 01:27:32,378
And what are you gonna do about it?

1832
01:27:32,455 --> 01:27:35,618
Listen here, nothing's gonna stand in my
way,

1833
01:27:35,692 --> 01:27:37,887
so why don't you just go home to Daddy?

1834
01:27:37,961 --> 01:27:39,451
I've heard enough.

1835
01:27:39,529 --> 01:27:41,827
Oh? Well, that makes two of us.

1836
01:27:41,898 --> 01:27:42,865
Henry?

1837
01:27:42,932 --> 01:27:46,231
Don't waste time. Just get it over with.

1838
01:27:46,302 --> 01:27:47,200
Do it.

1839
01:27:48,672 --> 01:27:49,764
You hear me?

1840
01:28:21,204 --> 01:28:22,364
Unh!

1841
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:24,372
Sorry.

1842
01:28:58,475 --> 01:29:00,375
Ha ha ha! Do something.

1843
01:29:28,138 --> 01:29:31,130
Catch! Ha ha ha!

1844
01:29:36,713 --> 01:29:40,342
What are you gonna do now? Ha ha
ha!

1845
01:29:46,856 --> 01:29:47,982
Help him!

1846
01:29:55,431 --> 01:29:56,363
Hey!

1847
01:31:29,914 --> 01:31:32,348
Drunken boxing, huh?

1848
01:31:33,451 --> 01:31:34,816
Well, what do you say?

1849
01:31:38,056 --> 01:31:38,988
Come on!

1850
01:32:01,579 --> 01:32:02,409
Ooh!

1851
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:04,539
You OK?

1852
01:32:39,684 --> 01:32:43,142
Aah!

1853
01:32:52,697 --> 01:32:54,688
Yaah!

1854
01:33:03,007 --> 01:33:05,669
Now it's over!

1855
01:33:18,523 --> 01:33:20,047
Give me another rod!

1856
01:33:20,124 --> 01:33:21,648
What's this?

1857
01:33:21,726 --> 01:33:24,490
"A boat can float in water, but also
sink in it"?

1858
01:33:24,562 --> 01:33:26,996
Ahh, a bit of Daddy's wisdom.

1859
01:33:30,268 --> 01:33:32,759
Here, finish him off!

1860
01:33:34,572 --> 01:33:35,596
All right, this is it!

1861
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:40,076
Aah!

1862
01:33:52,390 --> 01:33:54,324
Gah!

1863
01:34:12,877 --> 01:34:14,174
Yaah!

1864
01:35:23,448 --> 01:35:25,245
Just perfect!

1865
01:35:27,385 --> 01:35:28,579
How about it?

1866
01:36:52,336 --> 01:36:55,169
Raah!

1867
01:38:18,656 --> 01:38:19,953
Hee hee hee!

1868
01:38:27,431 --> 01:38:30,161
Yaah!

1869
01:38:48,252 --> 01:38:50,220
Hmm.

1870
01:38:58,563 --> 01:39:00,724
On behalf of the governor, I want to
thank Fei-Hong

1871
01:39:00,798 --> 01:39:02,698
for his role in returning the stolen
antiquities

1872
01:39:02,767 --> 01:39:04,826
and on the arrest of the ambassador.

1873
01:39:04,902 --> 01:39:05,834
Thank you, sir.

1874
01:39:05,903 --> 01:39:06,892
None of this could have happened

1875
01:39:06,971 --> 01:39:08,370
without the support of his loving father.

1876
01:39:08,439 --> 01:39:10,873
Ah, well, we need more fathers

1877
01:39:10,942 --> 01:39:12,910
who treat their sons like that.

1878
01:39:12,977 --> 01:39:16,344
You should be very proud of him.

1879
01:39:16,414 --> 01:39:17,574
So, where is he?

1880
01:39:17,648 --> 01:39:20,776
Fei-Hong is still feeling some of the
after-effects

1881
01:39:20,852 --> 01:39:22,513
of all that he's been through.

1882
01:39:22,587 --> 01:39:23,986
We hope he'll soon be on his feet.

1883
01:39:24,055 --> 01:39:28,048
I'm sure that he will come see you as
soon as he can.

1884
01:39:28,125 --> 01:39:30,093
Oh, and he better. I've got a job for
that boy.

1885
01:39:30,161 --> 01:39:32,493
I am certain he will be most pleased.

1886
01:39:32,563 --> 01:39:35,657
Smile! Count to 3! 1... 2...
