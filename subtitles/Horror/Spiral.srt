1
00:01:12,279 --> 00:01:13,623
What?

2
00:01:16,751 --> 00:01:18,449
What is it?
- Go back to sleep.

3
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,505
Hey you're alive. I'm hanging up.
- I think I did something.

4
00:01:24,558 --> 00:01:28,885
Yeah.. You did, you woke 
my ass up at four in the morning.

5
00:01:29,577 --> 00:01:34,655
I think.. Something bad.
- Where is your inhaler?

6
00:01:34,822 --> 00:01:36,431
In my bedroom.

7
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,771
Good.
Here's what you're gonna do.

8
00:01:38,855 --> 00:01:44,549
You're gonna hang up the phone, you're gonna walk to the bedroom,
take a hit off that thing and go to bed.

9
00:01:46,402 --> 00:01:47,660
Mason?

10
00:01:50,457 --> 00:01:53,818
Someone call the Police.
- Call the Police?

11
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,926
Shit, Mason.
I think you can handle it.

12
00:01:57,141 --> 00:01:58,991
So what are you gonna do?

13
00:01:59,414 --> 00:02:01,474
Use my inhaler.

14
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,060
And go to bed.

15
00:02:05,267 --> 00:02:08,622
Good, buddy.
Breating in bed

16
00:02:10,202 --> 00:02:13,719
I'm gonna do my part 
and I'm gonna go back to sleep.

17
00:02:14,183 --> 00:02:17,747
See, it's like teamwork only
I don't do anything. Get it?

18
00:02:19,149 --> 00:02:20,385
Okay?

19
00:02:22,163 --> 00:02:24,112
You're gonna be alright.

20
00:02:35,484 --> 00:02:37,591
I'm gonna be alright.

21
00:02:58,672 --> 00:03:00,998
JZD&J
INSURANCE.

22
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,937
You're late.

23
00:04:03,573 --> 00:04:05,232
Did you hear me?
Where have you been?

24
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:07,103
I'm sorry.

25
00:04:07,524 --> 00:04:10,794
Well that's real nice of you Mason
but it's not helping. You know why?

26
00:04:10,806 --> 00:04:13,981
Because I got 6000 phonecalls that
have to be made by the end of the week

27
00:04:14,016 --> 00:04:19,562
and an employee who can't get his ass to 
work on time, even though he lives two blocks away.

28
00:04:22,201 --> 00:04:23,907
Shit, I'm sorry.

29
00:04:24,657 --> 00:04:30,150
I guess I'm just tired from someone 
waking me up in the middle of the night.

30
00:04:31,154 --> 00:04:33,949
See how that can make a guy
cranky in the morning Mason?

31
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:37,594
Okay then.
You okay?

32
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,875
Get some sleep finally?

33
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,594
Good to make some calls?

34
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,443
Okay. Good.

35
00:04:45,503 --> 00:04:47,976
Then get to work, you crazy bastard.

36
00:04:53,444 --> 00:04:57,429
Yes, I believe I can help
lower your rates by 20%.

37
00:04:57,492 --> 00:04:58,510
Let me ask.

38
00:04:58,545 --> 00:05:02,390
Have you, or anyone in your family
ever been in a car accident?

39
00:05:04,072 --> 00:05:07,816
The rates are fixed and they
stay the same for the life of the plan.

40
00:05:21,619 --> 00:05:22,976
Yes mam.

41
00:05:23,527 --> 00:05:25,264
Can you.. please hold.

42
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,458
She's pretty.
Who is she?

43
00:06:42,867 --> 00:06:44,081
She is..

44
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:48,028
Nobody.

45
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,809
Then you have a good imagination.

46
00:06:53,172 --> 00:06:54,828
What are you doing?

47
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:58,115
Huh? Oh.. just..

48
00:06:58,195 --> 00:07:00,434
Eating potatoes.
You want some?

49
00:07:07,602 --> 00:07:08,845
Amber.

50
00:07:14,885 --> 00:07:16,915
Picked a really nice spot here.

51
00:07:17,942 --> 00:07:19,915
It's like a middle school inside.

52
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:24,963
Feel like I should smoke a cigarrete
and make out with an eighth grader.

53
00:07:27,137 --> 00:07:29,527
Anyway. What did you say your
name was again?

54
00:07:35,546 --> 00:07:37,425
I really like your drawings.

55
00:07:38,023 --> 00:07:41,203
I.. I don't draw. I sketch.

56
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,455
I'm a painter.

57
00:07:54,454 --> 00:07:56,426
Looks like it's gonna rain again.

58
00:08:20,594 --> 00:08:23,112
Get in the car man!
What the hell are you doing?

59
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,120
Get your ass in the car, man.

60
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:31,102
Seriously bro, you're a grown man.
Invest in an umbrella.

61
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:38,116
So hey Mason.
Are we heading to the apartment?

62
00:08:39,536 --> 00:08:41,462
Or we'll just sit right here.

63
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:46,142
Hey Mason, whats up?

64
00:08:49,712 --> 00:08:54,055
You remember Christie? She was a year
ahead of us. I hired her today.

65
00:08:54,382 --> 00:08:57,733
Brought her on for 20 cents
less than you. The bitch.

66
00:08:58,076 --> 00:09:02,530
She's got fakes now, so you might
wanna start drawing her.

67
00:09:07,274 --> 00:09:08,366
Come on Mason.

68
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:11,587
It's pouring out there.
We're having a conversation!

69
00:09:12,606 --> 00:09:15,918
I'm really getting
sick of this shit Mason.

70
00:10:28,557 --> 00:10:29,838
No mam.

71
00:10:29,945 --> 00:10:33,854
We only handle annual and
bi-annual schedules.

72
00:10:43,646 --> 00:10:45,037
What?

73
00:10:47,609 --> 00:10:50,012
I'm sorry.
I'm not familiar with that.

74
00:10:50,903 --> 00:10:53,692
Yeah, I'm gonna have to
check with my supervisor.

75
00:10:53,948 --> 00:10:55,556
Can you please hold?

76
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:11,176
So you're from Kentucky.
- I've been here for almost three months.

77
00:11:11,257 --> 00:11:15,344
You're awfully far from home.
Hey Mason, what's cooking?

78
00:11:15,802 --> 00:11:17,210
Yeah, tell me about it.

79
00:11:21,449 --> 00:11:24,125
Nah, that's a great plan.
I actually got one for my grandma.

80
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,717
True story.

81
00:11:27,748 --> 00:11:29,360
Can you hold on for one second.

82
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,655
Can I help you?

83
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:34,566
I need to do an R27.

84
00:11:34,846 --> 00:11:36,224
So?

85
00:11:37,847 --> 00:11:39,919
I'v never done one.

86
00:11:39,924 --> 00:11:41,018
Hold on.

87
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,789
JZD&J

88
00:11:42,825 --> 00:11:46,763
Absolutely, he's at his desk,
just let me transfer you there.

89
00:11:48,478 --> 00:11:50,290
What is it you need?

90
00:11:51,673 --> 00:11:53,921
How to do an R27.

91
00:11:54,082 --> 00:11:55,967
What am I, the guy you ask that?

92
00:11:56,464 --> 00:11:57,696
I just..
- Hold on.

93
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,324
Yeah, absolutely, it's a..

94
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,582
Please go away.

95
00:12:05,723 --> 00:12:09,078
It's called an R27.
I can set you up an account...

96
00:12:09,921 --> 00:12:12,624
I just had a look for you
and it looks like I can save you...

97
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,292
It rained.

98
00:13:36,155 --> 00:13:38,729
I should have been a weather girl.

99
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,708
My superviser says I'm
not cut out for sales.

100
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:47,608
Isn't that great?

101
00:13:47,691 --> 00:13:49,961
I've been here under than a week 
and already she's giving me these

102
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,451
'You're not right for this job'-talk

103
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:54,940
So I'm not the milk man.

104
00:13:54,975 --> 00:13:56,491
Six sales a day.

105
00:13:56,534 --> 00:13:58,351
I'm still learning.

106
00:14:05,507 --> 00:14:08,054
I spit in her drink.

107
00:14:11,281 --> 00:14:12,522
Her coffee,

108
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,798
I spit in it.

109
00:14:17,334 --> 00:14:21,054
Which is really immature, but it
was just sitting there and i was just,

110
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,401
You know I really want to be good at this, 
I really do, but,

111
00:14:25,271 --> 00:14:29,213
It's just not fair for someone
to treat someone that way.

112
00:14:31,035 --> 00:14:35,265
So what do I do? I go and act
like a teenager, and I just do

113
00:14:35,403 --> 00:14:37,256
something really stupid.

114
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:42,623
And now I feel like this.

115
00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:49,991
She probably deserved it.

116
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,826
Sir, we are an auto
insurance company.

117
00:15:12,262 --> 00:15:14,294
No. Sir,

118
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,318
We don't do life insurance.

119
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:19,204
No, we just...

120
00:15:20,218 --> 00:15:21,919
Okay.

121
00:15:30,965 --> 00:15:34,787
Just think of it like make-up sex,
without the awkwardness.

122
00:15:34,822 --> 00:15:36,350
..or the sex.

123
00:15:37,247 --> 00:15:38,502
Thanks.

124
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,569
What can I say, 
I'm a great guy.

125
00:15:40,647 --> 00:15:45,312
Besides, I know your routine, 
I can tell when it's time to move on.

126
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:53,012
There's a whole ocean out there 
for you to dip your rod in. Carpe Diem.

127
00:15:55,138 --> 00:15:57,565
So whatever.
It was just $10.

128
00:15:58,831 --> 00:16:01,548
Hey you know, why don't we go
play some ball later this week.

129
00:16:01,615 --> 00:16:04,007
Lunch hour at the court.
Like old time sakes.

130
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:06,680
You can work on your jumpshot.

131
00:16:07,365 --> 00:16:10,637
I don't have a jumpshot.
- That's exactly my point.

132
00:18:13,012 --> 00:18:18,725
She is calling me all the time,
she wants me to meet her parents, Look

133
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,047
I just think there should be an agreement,
Some sort of conversation between the two parties.

134
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,053
Because until then, you should have 
the opportunity to entertain other options.

135
00:18:27,249 --> 00:18:28,442
Does she know that?

136
00:18:28,686 --> 00:18:31,752
God no, what are you kidding?
She would never agree to that.

137
00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:34,155
Not about the other options.

138
00:18:34,257 --> 00:18:35,279
Come on.

139
00:18:35,744 --> 00:18:38,368
So I fired that chick
Christie already.

140
00:18:38,479 --> 00:18:39,624
Why?

141
00:18:39,693 --> 00:18:42,693
She showed up late for 
work her first three days.

142
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:45,393
Anyway, it doesn't matter, 
she has a boyfriend.

143
00:18:46,036 --> 00:18:47,257
Have you..

144
00:18:47,582 --> 00:18:50,307
Hired anyone else recently?

145
00:18:50,511 --> 00:18:52,645
Mason, I hire people all the time.

146
00:18:52,739 --> 00:18:54,360
No, I mean like..

147
00:18:55,493 --> 00:18:57,157
Girls.

148
00:18:59,676 --> 00:19:01,921
Someone's on the prowl huh?

149
00:19:03,148 --> 00:19:04,398
Lemme think.. no.

150
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,818
But I'm not the only one
that does hiring. Why?

151
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:09,856
Nothing.

152
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:14,370
Nothing huh.
Alright, an office romance.

153
00:19:14,552 --> 00:19:16,372
That can be a tricky thing.

154
00:19:17,955 --> 00:19:22,222
Shit, I've had my wings cut in 
that nasty web quite a few times.

155
00:19:23,131 --> 00:19:25,025
Fortunately it doesn't matter.

156
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,970
Just shoot the damn ball. You're 
never gonna get better unless you practise.

157
00:19:30,384 --> 00:19:32,376
I don't want to get better.

158
00:19:32,995 --> 00:19:35,079
And therein lies your problem.

159
00:19:49,832 --> 00:19:52,905
Mason! Hey!
Wait up.

160
00:19:53,373 --> 00:19:56,632
Hey.
-Hey! I missed you today at lunch.

161
00:19:56,667 --> 00:20:00,400
Yeah, I..
- Do you always walk home? Don't have a car?

162
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,634
Oh. A nature thing, I get it.

163
00:20:03,741 --> 00:20:05,440
What are you doing this weekend?

164
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:06,931
Nothing.

165
00:20:06,947 --> 00:20:09,475
Are you going to the 
'end of the promotion'-thing?

166
00:20:09,812 --> 00:20:13,065
Because I was thinking about 
going, you should go.

167
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,159
You're very.. Happy.

168
00:20:15,283 --> 00:20:19,821
That could be because somebody
got all her numbers today.

169
00:20:20,318 --> 00:20:25,063
I got all my numbers.

170
00:20:25,449 --> 00:20:27,685
You know what that means Mason?

171
00:20:27,904 --> 00:20:32,615
Coffee is safe again?
- No, it was only one cup, didn't touch the pot!

172
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,559
It was surgical strikes Mason.
Surgical strikes.

173
00:20:35,938 --> 00:20:40,685
So anyway, now that I have conqured 
my current job, what should I do next?

174
00:20:40,838 --> 00:20:43,130
I was thinking feminist or astronaut.

175
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:46,032
Probably feminist.
I'm afraid of heights.

176
00:20:46,491 --> 00:20:48,477
What does a feminist do?

177
00:20:48,675 --> 00:20:51,279
Mostly just bitches about stuff.

178
00:20:52,862 --> 00:20:54,741
Heh, I dunno.
Oh! Maybe ninja!

179
00:20:54,907 --> 00:20:58,425
I've always thought there aren't
enough girl ninjas in the world.

180
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,786
I love that word by the way. 
Say it! Ninja!

181
00:21:01,874 --> 00:21:04,394
C'mon Mason say it!
Ninjaaa.

182
00:21:05,258 --> 00:21:07,400
Ninja Mason, Ninja. Say it.
- Ninja.

183
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:10,635
Doesn't that sound great?
You know what you get?

184
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,596
You get a Karate chop!

185
00:21:13,962 --> 00:21:16,628
That's gonna bruise.
I've been practising.

186
00:21:17,387 --> 00:21:22,645
Seriously, I just think it'd be nice
to have a job that makes you feel good.

187
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,185
Um, I live here.

188
00:21:29,823 --> 00:21:31,540
Okay.

189
00:21:34,516 --> 00:21:38,691
Well, gee Mason.
Thank you for walking me home.

190
00:21:38,858 --> 00:21:45,181
Perhaps you would like to come in 
and have some coffee or something, look at my art?

191
00:21:48,612 --> 00:21:50,999
Great.
Alright I'll see you later.

192
00:21:51,482 --> 00:21:52,851
Thank you.

193
00:21:56,245 --> 00:21:58,370
For the umbrella.

194
00:21:58,576 --> 00:22:00,487
Oh yeah. Of course.

195
00:22:00,536 --> 00:22:05,936
These things are pretty rare in this 
town, but if you look hard you can find one.

196
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,101
Probably shouldn't get mine wet.

197
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:10,053
You suck at this game, you know that?

198
00:25:15,951 --> 00:25:18,010
Stop whining.

199
00:25:21,426 --> 00:25:23,308
Brings a sack to a party?
At least he's not wearing his backpack.

200
00:25:23,464 --> 00:25:24,988
Guys, just play the game.

201
00:25:26,747 --> 00:25:28,078
You alright buddy?

202
00:25:29,921 --> 00:25:31,114
Do you have..

203
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,301
any water?

204
00:25:35,469 --> 00:25:39,072
Mason, you're at a party, if you 
want water you don't have to ask.

205
00:25:39,619 --> 00:25:40,841
That was a lucky kill.

206
00:25:40,871 --> 00:25:43,414
Two in a row?
Is that lucky?

207
00:25:43,449 --> 00:25:47,176
It was one! You killed yourself
the second time! Blew yourself up!

208
00:25:47,211 --> 00:25:49,027
It was him.
It was you.

209
00:25:49,629 --> 00:25:50,763
(you didn't kill anybody!).

210
00:25:58,988 --> 00:26:00,300
Guess who!

211
00:26:02,221 --> 00:26:03,513
I always hated that game.

212
00:26:04,101 --> 00:26:06,546
As soon as the other person 
hears your voice, it's over.

213
00:26:06,784 --> 00:26:11,135
I want to create my own game where 
no one has to say anything, just guess.

214
00:26:11,182 --> 00:26:14,719
You came.
- Yeah of course I came, I told you I would.

215
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,762
Are you getting ready to leave.. or?

216
00:26:20,434 --> 00:26:22,100
That's real cute!

217
00:26:22,758 --> 00:26:24,504
Real cute.

218
00:26:24,632 --> 00:26:26,516
I hate these people.

219
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:29,113
Then why'd you come?

220
00:26:29,368 --> 00:26:31,445
Not for them.

221
00:26:32,766 --> 00:26:34,611
Look!

222
00:26:45,486 --> 00:26:48,019
Look at all of this.

223
00:26:56,094 --> 00:26:58,120
This is so beautiful.

224
00:27:00,557 --> 00:27:03,271
It's cold.
- Oh, quit.

225
00:27:04,507 --> 00:27:08,400
It's so worth the view.
No pain no gain Mason.

226
00:27:09,138 --> 00:27:10,456
This is..

227
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,090
Nice.

228
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:14,287
See?

229
00:27:14,413 --> 00:27:16,029
I told you.

230
00:27:16,175 --> 00:27:19,246
Look you can see Lower Hurst Park from here.

231
00:27:19,414 --> 00:27:22,769
I used to go feed the ducks there 
when I was little. It was amazing.

232
00:27:25,202 --> 00:27:27,403
I think that's the phone bank.

233
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,995
Oh yeah, you're right.

234
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,113
And look, there's your apartment.

235
00:27:32,566 --> 00:27:35,796
If I had a view like this..

236
00:27:35,831 --> 00:27:38,586
You look out of my window 
and all you see is bricks.

237
00:27:38,912 --> 00:27:41,030
You should paint this, Mason.

238
00:27:42,605 --> 00:27:45,600
I dont.. do scenery.

239
00:27:46,378 --> 00:27:48,144
Just people?

240
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:53,961
Like uh..
Like the girl in your sketches?

241
00:27:56,585 --> 00:27:58,384
Sorry.

242
00:27:58,504 --> 00:28:00,793
It's really none of my business.

243
00:28:02,441 --> 00:28:04,718
We all have a history.

244
00:28:05,245 --> 00:28:08,709
If I told you my life story, 
we'd be here for the rest of the night.

245
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:14,379
But um..

246
00:28:15,675 --> 00:28:17,157
You're not..

247
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:22,378
.. painting anyone right now, are you?

248
00:28:27,054 --> 00:28:28,558
No. Noone.

249
00:28:34,195 --> 00:28:36,214
You know we could walk from here.

250
00:28:57,704 --> 00:29:00,306
Maybe you should just take your own coat.

251
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,137
Bat cave?

252
00:30:04,624 --> 00:30:05,827
Can I..

253
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:08,132
Yeah sure.

254
00:31:57,835 --> 00:31:59,764
They were my first.

255
00:32:10,085 --> 00:32:12,688
All the great Jazz albums.

256
00:32:14,128 --> 00:32:15,983
Is that what we're gonna do?

257
00:32:21,061 --> 00:32:23,888
Only with bigger brushes.

258
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:26,843
Are you calling me fat?

259
00:32:38,805 --> 00:32:41,142
They're postcards.

260
00:32:42,763 --> 00:32:44,715
They're awesome.

261
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,806
Did you make them
for someone special?

262
00:33:03,251 --> 00:33:06,951
Am I doing this right?
Is there something I should be doing?

263
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:10,890
Just..

264
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:13,907
Be you.

265
00:33:55,129 --> 00:33:58,700
Hey buddy!
Whatcha doing?

266
00:33:58,753 --> 00:34:00,754
Didn't see you leave last night.

267
00:34:00,951 --> 00:34:02,118
Everything okay?

268
00:34:02,387 --> 00:34:03,501
Fine.

269
00:34:04,045 --> 00:34:09,447
I knew that sketch pad would do 
you good, best $10 I ever spent.

270
00:34:09,595 --> 00:34:12,640
You wouldn't believe how long
those assholes stayed at my house last night.

271
00:34:12,785 --> 00:34:15,750
Next time we're doing it somewhere else,
let Senior management pick up the tab.

272
00:34:16,021 --> 00:34:17,100
I gotta go.

273
00:34:17,445 --> 00:34:18,973
Eat.

274
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:21,552
Why don't you come eat in 
my office for a change?

275
00:34:36,024 --> 00:34:38,135
My grandma was a dream reader.

276
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:41,693
It's true.
My whole family is practically gypsies.

277
00:34:43,835 --> 00:34:48,751
Did you know that in Romania, they
still have whole tribes of gypsies.

278
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:51,012
It's crazy! They just, you know..

279
00:34:51,202 --> 00:34:57,670
Ride around the countryside on wagons,
drawn by horses. Campfires, the whole thing.

280
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:03,341
Wouldn't it be great to be just,
you know, free?

281
00:35:05,424 --> 00:35:07,414
Free to what?

282
00:35:08,502 --> 00:35:10,224
Just do whatever.

283
00:35:10,495 --> 00:35:12,579
Just to.. go. You know.

284
00:35:12,614 --> 00:35:15,117
It wouldn't even matter where.

285
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,400
Let me see your hand.

286
00:35:18,906 --> 00:35:20,140
Why?

287
00:35:20,538 --> 00:35:21,732
Let me see it!

288
00:35:21,748 --> 00:35:24,117
I want to see if your life line
matches up with your health line.

289
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:28,358
If it does, that usually means
you're gonna get married.

290
00:35:31,814 --> 00:35:34,223
Are you doubting my gypsie blood?

291
00:35:36,214 --> 00:35:39,139
No.
- Well you better not be.

292
00:35:40,006 --> 00:35:41,951
I could put a hex on you.

293
00:35:42,927 --> 00:35:46,493
I think hexes are more 
for witches than gypsies.

294
00:35:50,458 --> 00:35:52,526
You just made a joke!

295
00:35:52,972 --> 00:35:54,952
You big phoney.

296
00:35:55,492 --> 00:35:57,489
Did you just call me a witch?

297
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:04,751
So, you get her naked yet?

298
00:36:05,585 --> 00:36:07,300
It's not like that.

299
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:09,662
Well if would be
if I was painting them.

300
00:36:09,888 --> 00:36:11,778
Seriously buddy,
it's a good scam you're running.

301
00:36:11,813 --> 00:36:14,424
Chicks dig the quiet
artsy guy.

302
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:18,499
Hey what about this one?

303
00:36:20,657 --> 00:36:22,522
I don't think that's Jazz.

304
00:36:22,567 --> 00:36:24,395
You barely looked at it.

305
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,328
There are not a lot of 
soprano saxophones in Jazz.

306
00:36:28,709 --> 00:36:31,286
Oh yeah smartypants? Wanna see 
how much you really know?

307
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:33,642
Soft Hits.
Smooth jazz.

308
00:36:34,711 --> 00:36:37,206
Smooth jazz isn't jazz.

309
00:36:38,419 --> 00:36:41,958
How is it possible that you of 
all people are a snob about something.

310
00:36:42,294 --> 00:36:45,608
No, Buddy Holly didn't give
out a live album in 1962.

311
00:36:46,763 --> 00:36:48,586
Because he died in '59.

312
00:36:51,091 --> 00:36:54,147
That's a good one, 
it's like a weather report on crack.

313
00:36:54,182 --> 00:36:55,810
Yeah, as long as it's not 'smooth'.

314
00:36:56,502 --> 00:36:57,610
I don't get it.

315
00:36:57,669 --> 00:36:59,851
Guess you don't get Jazz.

 316
00:37:00,386 --> 00:37:03,199
Listen. That redhead.
She's still working here?

317
00:37:03,251 --> 00:37:04,821
Haven't seen her around.

318
00:37:16,286 --> 00:37:19,986
Ducks!
Look at all of them, aren't they great!

319
00:37:21,587 --> 00:37:27,078
You gotta spend more time outdoors, really. 
It's my new-years resolution for you.

320
00:37:27,113 --> 00:37:31,079
Can't believe you lived here your 
whole life and not once come down here.

321
00:37:31,283 --> 00:37:34,935
Man, these ducks are 
seriously fatter than I remember.

322
00:37:36,018 --> 00:37:39,638
Look at that little kid 
feeding those fat freezing birds.

323
00:37:41,082 --> 00:37:45,557
I used to do that when 
I was little. I made them fat.

324
00:37:46,425 --> 00:37:48,083
I did that.

325
00:37:53,182 --> 00:37:54,460
Come on.

326
00:37:55,253 --> 00:37:57,904
Don't I get to see 
what you're working on?

327
00:37:57,939 --> 00:37:59,578
No, there's rules.

328
00:37:59,613 --> 00:38:01,457
You can't see it
until it's finished.

329
00:38:01,492 --> 00:38:04,812
Yes, I've been very understanding
when it comes to that part about painting

330
00:38:04,872 --> 00:38:09,629
but I think that I deserve to
see a first draft.

331
00:38:10,266 --> 00:38:11,604
It's not that.

332
00:38:12,326 --> 00:38:14,173
This is the next one.

333
00:38:15,653 --> 00:38:17,862
Who said there was going
to be a next one.

334
00:38:25,037 --> 00:38:28,659
Mason, do you think that
pictures capture peoples souls?

335
00:38:28,699 --> 00:38:30,389
Indians thought so.

336
00:38:30,737 --> 00:38:33,276
Not all of them,
but mostly.

337
00:38:33,756 --> 00:38:35,583
I wonder what
they would think of this.

338
00:38:40,888 --> 00:38:43,263
You trying to steal my soul Mason?

339
00:38:54,997 --> 00:38:57,818
Yeap. These ducks sure are fat.

340
00:39:00,006 --> 00:39:01,595
You got turkey right?

341
00:39:02,336 --> 00:39:05,070
Yes.
- Then the damage is already done.

342
00:39:15,272 --> 00:39:16,351
Get in the middle.

343
00:39:16,538 --> 00:39:17,934
Get them all.

344
00:39:18,278 --> 00:39:20,643
Can you jump?
Are you like a dolphin?

345
00:39:21,535 --> 00:39:23,883
Oh it's on your head.
I'm sorry!

346
00:39:25,287 --> 00:39:27,335
...that same movie released.

347
00:39:27,975 --> 00:39:32,818
There's this old theater
in the neighbourhood where I grew up.

348
00:39:32,938 --> 00:39:36,790
It played these great movies
like 'Casablanca' and 'Rear Window'.

349
00:39:36,825 --> 00:39:41,992
I used to go every day after school. 
I'd watch them over and over again.

350
00:39:43,571 --> 00:39:45,441
We should go sometime.

351
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:49,072
I've never been to a movie.

352
00:39:50,809 --> 00:39:53,216
I'm sorry, did you just say never?

353
00:39:54,029 --> 00:39:56,388
Even like, with your parents?

354
00:40:07,732 --> 00:40:12,221
So who did you make
the postcards for ?

355
00:40:19,497 --> 00:40:20,939
What?

356
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:00,497
Let's do the next one.

357
00:41:06,314 --> 00:41:09,139
I just have
a hard time getting into it.

358
00:41:09,207 --> 00:41:12,651
That's part of the point. 
Jazz isn't about accessibility.

359
00:41:12,686 --> 00:41:15,001
It is more 
difficult to relate to.

360
00:41:15,036 --> 00:41:20,114
It's not friendly or neat.
Only the finest musicians can play it.

361
00:41:20,357 --> 00:41:26,497
Masters. People who have devoted 
themselves to studying the theory of music.

362
00:41:26,532 --> 00:41:27,625
The Rules.

363
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:34,972
And then they get together, as a 
craft, and break these rules that they value.

364
00:41:35,231 --> 00:41:38,899
It's decadent and carnal.
All at the same time.

365
00:41:40,646 --> 00:41:45,066
I think that's probably the most 
words you've said to me in one sitting.

366
00:41:45,101 --> 00:41:47,487
I like Jazz.
- And I like coffee.

367
00:41:47,846 --> 00:41:50,370
And I can't believe 
you don't drink it.

368
00:41:50,405 --> 00:41:54,159
When we go in here, just do what I do.
We'll try to sell you....

369
00:42:44,591 --> 00:42:46,502
Where were you going?

370
00:43:18,593 --> 00:43:20,572
Can we talk about it?

371
00:43:22,221 --> 00:43:23,396
What?

372
00:43:24,472 --> 00:43:26,884
No, I.. I just..

373
00:43:27,416 --> 00:43:29,501
Can't figure out what colors to use

374
00:43:29,594 --> 00:43:31,562
for the shadows on your arm.

375
00:43:33,428 --> 00:43:36,025
So we're not gonna talk about it.

376
00:43:43,402 --> 00:43:44,941
Okay.

377
00:43:47,072 --> 00:43:49,053
So, why didn't you use the blue?

378
00:43:50,889 --> 00:43:53,252
Because it will pull
focus from your eyes.

379
00:43:54,255 --> 00:43:56,134
What about the orange?

380
00:43:56,419 --> 00:43:59,090
Too close to the tan of your slip.

381
00:44:00,434 --> 00:44:02,192
Does that matter?

382
00:44:03,522 --> 00:44:08,539
Yes..
It's all about contrast

383
00:44:09,489 --> 00:44:14,017
To accentuate some parts 
good enough to hide others.

384
00:44:14,052 --> 00:44:15,944
So they can't be noticed?

385
00:44:18,874 --> 00:44:22,416
So they won't draw attention.

386
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:31,465
Now I know
why you like to paint.

387
00:44:31,685 --> 00:44:33,465
Why?

388
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,259
Because you relate to it.

389
00:44:36,979 --> 00:44:39,083
That's what's great about you.

390
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,934
Contrast.

391
00:44:43,198 --> 00:44:45,108
I kind of envy that.

392
00:44:49,213 --> 00:44:51,567
You shouldn't envy me.

393
00:45:31,374 --> 00:45:33,192
That's me.

394
00:45:37,676 --> 00:45:39,319
Hold your damn elbow in.

395
00:45:39,863 --> 00:45:40,915
Line yourself up.

396
00:45:41,222 --> 00:45:43,397
And remember to follow
all the way through.

397
00:45:50,364 --> 00:45:52,184
You're still a great painter.

398
00:45:53,688 --> 00:45:55,629
So contrast, huh?

399
00:45:56,458 --> 00:45:58,024
I can see that.

400
00:45:58,313 --> 00:46:00,710
Some would call it manic,
but contrast works too.

401
00:46:01,084 --> 00:46:04,339
Oh come on, you've always been a bit 
manic. But you've come a long way since.

402
00:46:04,502 --> 00:46:06,213
I'm proud of you.

403
00:46:06,844 --> 00:46:08,413
Contrast.

404
00:46:10,638 --> 00:46:12,838
That's right.
Just like your paintings.

405
00:46:13,603 --> 00:46:15,223
I'm telling you. 
Chicks dig them.

406
00:46:16,013 --> 00:46:18,214
Remember little Jessica
from outdoor ed. ?

407
00:46:18,555 --> 00:46:21,803
She went nuts when she saw 
those postcards you used to paint.

408
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:24,018
She stole one.

409
00:46:24,383 --> 00:46:26,732
Yeah.
She went nuts!

410
00:46:27,112 --> 00:46:30,730
The teacher had to go through all 
of her stuff and found a pair of my underwear.

411
00:46:32,851 --> 00:46:34,924
I'm telling you, that chick was a freak.

412
00:46:35,481 --> 00:46:37,429
I wonder what she's doing now.

413
00:46:39,753 --> 00:46:42,515
Sorry. Berkley, they are 
looking for you for the one o clock.

414
00:46:42,589 --> 00:46:43,692
Hello babe.

415
00:46:44,788 --> 00:46:46,448
Conference room three.

416
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:48,611
Isn't she the cutest 
thing you've ever seen?

417
00:46:50,128 --> 00:46:52,099
God I love being the boss.

418
00:46:53,081 --> 00:46:54,840
We'll work on your shot later.

419
00:46:55,505 --> 00:46:57,234
Can I leave early today?

420
00:46:57,515 --> 00:47:00,548
Why, you need some primping
time before you go out clubbing?

421
00:47:01,212 --> 00:47:04,164
I'm kidding.
Do what you need to do.

422
00:47:04,936 --> 00:47:06,756
And people say
I'm not a nice guy.

423
00:47:07,242 --> 00:47:08,861
They don't actually say that.

424
00:47:09,959 --> 00:47:13,865
So, are you gonna tell me where we're 
going or do I have to push you in a puddle?

425
00:47:16,956 --> 00:47:18,604
I really like Christmas.

426
00:47:18,733 --> 00:47:21,885
It's the second week of December.
- Oh! You know what we should do?

427
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,487
We should go to the 
mall and sit on Santa's lap.

428
00:47:24,522 --> 00:47:27,820
And have our picture taken and 
tell him everything we want, and

429
00:47:27,888 --> 00:47:30,725
watch the really angry moms with
their screaming kids.

430
00:47:31,239 --> 00:47:32,845
No elves.

431
00:47:32,924 --> 00:47:34,508
Mason, are you afraid of elves?

432
00:47:34,888 --> 00:47:38,566
Like ghouls.
- That is like the cutest thing ever!

433
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:41,136
Oh wait. I have something for you.

434
00:47:44,182 --> 00:47:45,574
What is it?

435
00:47:46,024 --> 00:47:48,154
It's your gift, Mister.

436
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,730
You have to wait until
Christmas to open it.

437
00:47:52,049 --> 00:47:53,795
You'll ruin the surprise.

438
00:48:02,585 --> 00:48:04,399
They're bus tickets.

439
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:05,605
Bus tickets?

440
00:48:05,948 --> 00:48:07,384
And there's two of them.

441
00:48:07,604 --> 00:48:11,023
They are open which pretty 
much means we can go anywhere we want to.

442
00:48:11,082 --> 00:48:12,775
Like my gypsie kin.

443
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:14,081
Do you like them?

444
00:48:14,097 --> 00:48:16,258
Thank you.
- You're welcome!

445
00:48:19,392 --> 00:48:21,758
Close your eyes.
- What ?

446
00:48:22,021 --> 00:48:23,675
Just close your eyes.

447
00:48:24,249 --> 00:48:25,317
Okay.

448
00:48:28,128 --> 00:48:30,442
Let me guess.. Mason?

449
00:48:31,266 --> 00:48:33,096
Step down.
- Okay, stepping down.

450
00:48:51,748 --> 00:48:52,956
Just the one?

451
00:48:57,625 --> 00:48:58,981
Two.

452
00:49:20,463 --> 00:49:22,142
What do you think?

453
00:49:23,278 --> 00:49:24,644
For the next painting?

454
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:27,528
You look like...

455
00:49:28,225 --> 00:49:30,122
A Jazz player?

456
00:49:31,356 --> 00:49:33,218
A Jazz singer.

457
00:49:34,575 --> 00:49:40,407
Whatever. I like it. What's the point of 
being a model if you can't live a decadent life.

458
00:49:40,484 --> 00:49:43,892
What do you think?
Beige or true brown.

459
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:48,885
Never ask a girl if she
wants to be painted in Beige.

460
00:49:49,031 --> 00:49:51,675
The answer will always be the same.

461
00:49:53,738 --> 00:49:55,035
Oh! I'll be right back.

462
00:50:19,918 --> 00:50:21,097
Are you okay?

463
00:50:21,577 --> 00:50:23,422
I'm so sorry.

464
00:50:25,383 --> 00:50:26,999
I didn't mean to...

465
00:50:33,917 --> 00:50:35,407
It's okay. I'm just..

466
00:50:35,848 --> 00:50:37,101
just..

467
00:50:39,366 --> 00:50:42,297
I just get
startled easily.

468
00:50:43,094 --> 00:50:45,232
Was that me?
I'm sorry.

469
00:50:48,033 --> 00:50:49,277
Sorry.

470
00:50:56,371 --> 00:50:57,771
Just..

471
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:00,682
No more elves.

472
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:05,130
No more elves. Promise.
I'm sorry.

473
00:52:59,975 --> 00:53:02,838
Mother.

474
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:15,072
If she finds lipstick on a glass 
in the sink then she's too much for me.

475
00:53:15,157 --> 00:53:19,353
It's like she's looking for this shit.
It's like commitment, basically.

476
00:53:21,638 --> 00:53:25,647
Are you still painting
that 'contrast' girl?

477
00:53:26,555 --> 00:53:29,236
Yeah you must be, you're doing so well.

478
00:53:29,271 --> 00:53:32,540
You're hitting your numbers.
No more middle of the night phonecalls.

479
00:53:32,573 --> 00:53:35,567
Not that I mind bro, but
it can kill the moment from time to time.

480
00:53:35,602 --> 00:53:37,047
If you know what I mean.

481
00:53:37,648 --> 00:53:40,998
At the buzzer!
.. and fouled.

482
00:53:41,958 --> 00:53:43,940
Do you think I can bring her?

483
00:53:45,007 --> 00:53:46,982
What are you talking about?
Bring her where?

484
00:53:48,445 --> 00:53:50,290
To Christmas dinner.

485
00:53:50,958 --> 00:53:53,057
Do you think I can bring Amber?

486
00:53:53,613 --> 00:53:56,185
C'mon buddy. Do you 
really think that's a good idea?

487
00:53:57,498 --> 00:53:59,479
I'm trying Berkley.

488
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:03,790
And I know that. It's just..

489
00:54:06,664 --> 00:54:08,626
It's a big thing, you know,

490
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:10,991
This Christmas dinner.
I want you to be happy.

491
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,748
Why don't you just come have dinner with us.
That way you're not setting yourself up for..

492
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:17,958
Expectations.

493
00:54:21,346 --> 00:54:24,082
I don't know.
This one's.. different.

494
00:54:25,216 --> 00:54:26,790
This one's special.

495
00:54:28,712 --> 00:54:30,114
They are not special.

496
00:54:30,482 --> 00:54:33,862
They are just girls, Mason.
You should remember that.

497
00:54:39,056 --> 00:54:41,818
Look, you're a grown man. 
If you want to invite somebody..

498
00:54:44,038 --> 00:54:46,383
Just think about it. Okay?

499
00:54:46,418 --> 00:54:48,590
I mean you're really doing well.

500
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,748
I went and saw my mom.

501
00:54:53,385 --> 00:54:55,029
You went to the cemetary?

502
00:54:57,912 --> 00:54:59,546
I didn't know
you ever went out there.

503
00:55:00,215 --> 00:55:01,835
I don't.

504
00:55:02,282 --> 00:55:03,655
Well that's good.

505
00:55:04,713 --> 00:55:08,381
Take a page out of my book 
and don't dwell on the past.

506
00:55:08,859 --> 00:55:10,723
You think people go to hell?

507
00:55:14,697 --> 00:55:17,842
Are you asking me if I think 
your old man is going to hell?

508
00:55:22,067 --> 00:55:23,359
I don't know man.

509
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:32,047
No way.
Mason I'm not coming out.

510
00:55:32,672 --> 00:55:34,284
What are you talking about?

511
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:40,751
I don't know what kind of ideas 
you have about this, but I'm really a shy girl.

512
00:55:41,771 --> 00:55:44,655
You don't have to
if you don't want to.

513
00:55:46,165 --> 00:55:47,433
Okay..

514
00:55:47,627 --> 00:55:50,681
Promise you'll never 
tell anyone about this.

515
00:56:26,023 --> 00:56:27,492
Is this good?

516
00:56:28,881 --> 00:56:30,448
It's beautiful.

517
00:56:46,482 --> 00:56:49,760
So Miles will play all over that area,

518
00:56:50,179 --> 00:56:52,494
in different lounges and bars.

519
00:56:53,027 --> 00:56:56,812
One time this young bass player 
got the opportunity to work with him.

520
00:56:57,012 --> 00:56:59,769
To play with
the master himself.

521
00:56:59,804 --> 00:57:04,550
This kid looked up to Miles his whole life 
and was so excited about playing with him,

522
00:57:04,585 --> 00:57:10,449
That he practiced these really 
hard bass lines. He was great.

523
00:57:10,474 --> 00:57:13,179
He just went off on stage with Miles.

524
00:57:14,195 --> 00:57:20,076
So when they were taking a break, 
he walked up to him at the bar.

525
00:57:20,146 --> 00:57:23,940
And he asked him:
'How do you think I did?'

526
00:57:24,258 --> 00:57:31,184
Miles said; 'You were great, kid. you and 
me should hire a bass player and go on the road.'

527
00:57:32,733 --> 00:57:34,377
I don't get it.

528
00:57:35,801 --> 00:57:40,317
You know, because bass players
usually just do easy..

529
00:57:40,842 --> 00:57:43,317
And he was like all..
- Wait.. Hold on.

530
00:57:43,476 --> 00:57:45,877
I'm working on your shoulder.

531
00:57:45,938 --> 00:57:47,226
I'm sorry.

532
00:57:54,494 --> 00:57:56,608
How come I never got
to see your lifeline.

533
00:57:56,945 --> 00:57:58,924
You never asked again.

534
00:58:00,626 --> 00:58:02,392
Maybe I should've.

535
00:58:06,897 --> 00:58:09,952
Then maybe I would've been 
able to understand your ways.

536
00:58:12,018 --> 00:58:13,528
What ways?

537
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:16,717
You're just very secretive,

538
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:22,539
not so much your art, but you
definitely have.. boundaries.

539
00:58:23,764 --> 00:58:26,068
Maybe secretive isn't the right word.

540
00:58:29,454 --> 00:58:31,207
You're an enigma.

541
00:58:33,251 --> 00:58:39,877
Well.. Like you said. Contrast.

542
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:48,208
I hate these power surges.

543
00:58:49,042 --> 00:58:54,459
Isn't rain supposed to be better for 
electricity, like a hairdryer in the bathtub?

544
00:58:56,989 --> 00:59:00,982
That's one of the little ones, right?

545
00:59:02,099 --> 00:59:03,576
The postcards.

546
00:59:04,381 --> 00:59:06,189
This was his favorite.

547
00:59:08,917 --> 00:59:10,675
Who's favorite?

548
00:59:16,373 --> 00:59:19,191
We should keep working, we're almost finished
- Mason, who's favorite?

549
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:21,970
We're very close to being done.
- Mason, wh..

550
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:46,003
I didn't mean..
- It's..

551
00:59:48,527 --> 00:59:49,873
Late.

552
01:00:02,696 --> 01:00:05,172
They were for my father.

553
01:00:06,304 --> 01:00:10,057
He.. sent them all back.

554
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,282
He didn't want them.

555
01:01:22,042 --> 01:01:23,934
Is everything okay?

556
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:54,935
Do you want to have Christmas 
dinner at Berkley's with me?

557
01:02:13,677 --> 01:02:16,005
All I have is peanut butter.

558
01:02:16,448 --> 01:02:17,817
That's fine.

559
01:02:24,095 --> 01:02:26,023
Did you just sniff that?

560
01:02:29,012 --> 01:02:34,061
If there was a nuclear explosion, all that 
would be left would be peanut butter and cockroaches.

561
01:02:34,218 --> 01:02:35,496
It's fine.

562
01:02:41,822 --> 01:02:44,309
I'm just gonna put it on some bread.

563
01:02:46,167 --> 01:02:47,294
It's cold.

564
01:02:47,444 --> 01:02:48,848
Hey can I..

565
01:02:49,073 --> 01:02:52,681
..can I borrow some socks? 
The floor is freezing.

566
01:03:39,186 --> 01:03:40,804
I have apples too.

567
01:03:42,611 --> 01:03:45,836
I didn't know if
you wanted me to put the..

568
01:03:49,994 --> 01:03:52,348
What are you doing?

569
01:03:53,314 --> 01:03:57,159
I was looking for
some socks. It's cold.

570
01:04:19,324 --> 01:04:21,416
Last night was...

571
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:32,989
Let's finish the painting.

572
01:04:33,181 --> 01:04:34,439
Okay.

573
01:04:50,753 --> 01:04:52,671
I got my bonus this week.

574
01:04:56,227 --> 01:04:58,237
I hit all my sales.

575
01:04:59,158 --> 01:05:01,284
I haven't done that all year.

576
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:03,749
That's really great.

577
01:05:04,289 --> 01:05:06,778
Berkley said our floor is leading.

578
01:05:06,864 --> 01:05:08,805
That's a first time for him.

579
01:05:13,235 --> 01:05:14,785
What's next?
- Hey..

580
01:05:15,749 --> 01:05:17,846
I don't get to see whats next?

581
01:05:18,916 --> 01:05:20,667
You know the rules.

582
01:05:25,387 --> 01:05:27,901
Listen.. I have this idea..

583
01:05:29,419 --> 01:05:31,715
For one of the sketches..
- No.

584
01:05:32,449 --> 01:05:33,892
What?

585
01:05:34,643 --> 01:05:36,016
I just...

586
01:05:36,189 --> 01:05:38,179
I'm halfway through this pose.

587
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:43,286
I'm the one that's gonna have to do all these poses.
- You're not the artist.

588
01:05:55,016 --> 01:05:57,494
I'm sorry.
- Forget it.

589
01:05:59,063 --> 01:06:03,879
Look, why don't you come up with the next one.
- Just.. forget it. Okay?

590
01:06:07,238 --> 01:06:08,966
Are you mad?

591
01:06:16,894 --> 01:06:19,717
How many girls have you sketched?

592
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:22,228
Before me.

593
01:06:22,813 --> 01:06:23,895
What?

594
01:06:24,256 --> 01:06:26,631
How many Mason?
I want to know.

595
01:06:28,694 --> 01:06:30,294
I don't.. I don't know.

596
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:33,194
You don't know, 
or you don't want to say?

597
01:06:34,103 --> 01:06:38,014
Why are you doing this?
- I'm feeling a little vulnerable right now, okay?

598
01:06:38,037 --> 01:06:39,069
I don't..

599
01:06:39,217 --> 01:06:40,667
Normally..

600
01:06:42,141 --> 01:06:45,247
I don't normally do that.
- Well me either.

601
01:06:53,317 --> 01:06:54,645
I'm sorry.

602
01:07:02,428 --> 01:07:04,492
I just need some time.

603
01:07:04,671 --> 01:07:08,557
Why?
- It's not you. I just need to think.

604
01:07:08,598 --> 01:07:11,951
Are you still coming to Berkley's dinner?

605
01:07:15,679 --> 01:07:19,179
I need time to clear my head, okay?

606
01:07:51,972 --> 01:07:53,513
Damn rain.

607
01:07:57,111 --> 01:07:59,249
Maybe you should call her.

608
01:08:00,861 --> 01:08:04,341
She's probably just running late.

609
01:08:09,850 --> 01:08:12,111
Maybe I should go outside, 
Maybe..

610
01:08:12,146 --> 01:08:14,509
She forgot the address.

611
01:08:15,319 --> 01:08:17,893
Mason, do we really have to do this?

612
01:08:18,782 --> 01:08:20,650
Okay. We'll wait.

613
01:08:29,774 --> 01:08:32,290
Why did you even invite him?

614
01:08:32,443 --> 01:08:36,030
Please. Ten minutes ago you
were telling me to be nice.

615
01:08:36,226 --> 01:08:37,883
That's different.

616
01:08:38,011 --> 01:08:42,104
Oh I get it, in front of him it's 
one thing, but when he's not here it's another.

617
01:08:42,139 --> 01:08:44,912
That's not fair!
- What's not fair about it?

618
01:08:44,947 --> 01:08:47,831
You know what? I could've
been in Vancouver, with my family.

619
01:08:48,228 --> 01:08:50,015
So you're not having fun?

620
01:08:50,625 --> 01:08:53,027
Is that what this is? Fun?

621
01:08:53,062 --> 01:08:55,766
Is this entertainment?
- You better watch yourself.

622
01:08:55,801 --> 01:08:57,917
What is it Berkley?
Do you even know?

623
01:08:57,952 --> 01:09:01,480
Do you really want to know what this is? 
It's called friendship.

624
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:05,868
It's about him having one person in his life 
that is the same asshole to his face that he is to his back

625
01:09:05,903 --> 01:09:08,104
And it's about me being the only 
damn guy who gives a shit about him.

626
01:09:08,343 --> 01:09:10,868
That's not friendship.
That's charity.

627
01:09:11,061 --> 01:09:12,101
Oh is that right?
- Yeah.

628
01:09:12,136 --> 01:09:14,347
It's him being your pet.

629
01:09:14,670 --> 01:09:16,785
You know what?
To hell with this shit.

630
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:19,023
I hear Canada
is nice this time of the year.

631
01:09:19,302 --> 01:09:21,150
What?
- Get out.

632
01:09:21,409 --> 01:09:24,196
You can't be serious.
- Get. Out.

633
01:09:24,315 --> 01:09:25,804
Listen to yourself.

634
01:09:26,427 --> 01:09:28,075
I cooked this whole damn meal.

635
01:09:28,216 --> 01:09:30,182
Happy Christmas.
Hit the road.

636
01:09:30,281 --> 01:09:33,264
You're sick!
- And you're still here.

637
01:09:33,366 --> 01:09:36,874
You think it makes you a better 
person because you invite him over for dinner?

638
01:09:36,944 --> 01:09:38,888
Or that you talk to 
him for five minutes at work?

639
01:09:38,993 --> 01:09:41,627
If you wanted to help him,
You would get him help.

640
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:44,406
Put some coal in my stocking.

641
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:46,396
You're using him.

642
01:09:46,977 --> 01:09:51,042
No no honey. The only
one I'm using is you.

643
01:10:02,224 --> 01:10:04,283
Drive safe!

644
01:10:05,558 --> 01:10:07,465
That wasn't about you bro.

645
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:12,647
She's a bitch, what can I say, 
I don't have a more concerning phrase.

646
01:10:13,599 --> 01:10:17,358
I couldn't find Amber.
- You know what? Enough of this Amber shit.

647
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:20,903
I'm gonna smoke this, then
we're gonna go back and have a nice dinner.

648
01:10:20,938 --> 01:10:24,644
She couldn't be lost. 
She was at your party.

649
01:10:24,954 --> 01:10:26,525
She was what, she was here?

650
01:10:27,021 --> 01:10:29,455
Mason, you can't
keep doing this to yourself.

651
01:10:29,993 --> 01:10:32,372
Maybe she thought we 
were meeting at my place.

652
01:10:32,407 --> 01:10:34,146
Do we have to go through this again?

653
01:10:34,303 --> 01:10:37,149
It's because you went to the 
damn cemetary, that's what it is.

654
01:10:37,459 --> 01:10:39,988
You can't keep setting yourself 
up for rejection like that.

655
01:10:41,178 --> 01:10:43,924
I have to go find her.
- Mason, calm down.

656
01:10:43,981 --> 01:10:45,940
Don't touch me!

657
01:12:33,788 --> 01:12:35,471
What are you..

658
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:38,332
Where have you been?
- Can I come in?

659
01:12:50,792 --> 01:12:52,961
I'm sorry, I'm...

660
01:12:52,996 --> 01:12:54,086
I'm sorry.

661
01:12:54,306 --> 01:12:58,756
I just couldn't do this there.
- Do what?

662
01:13:00,577 --> 01:13:04,300
I can't. I think we got confused.

663
01:13:05,167 --> 01:13:07,023
What are you talking about?

664
01:13:07,058 --> 01:13:10,877
I think you want me to 
be something that I can't be.

665
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:15,375
What do you mean?

666
01:13:15,807 --> 01:13:19,095
Why can't I see the next pose Mason?

667
01:13:19,516 --> 01:13:24,944
Because there are rules..
- What rules? What does that even mean?

668
01:13:24,979 --> 01:13:28,762
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this to me?

669
01:13:28,797 --> 01:13:31,447
Am I some kind of replacement?

670
01:13:32,112 --> 01:13:33,924
Who are you trying to get over?

671
01:13:33,959 --> 01:13:35,840
What are you talking about?

672
01:13:35,875 --> 01:13:40,377
The sketchbooks. Filled with 
copies of the same poses.

673
01:13:40,412 --> 01:13:42,046
How do you think that makes me feel?

674
01:13:50,858 --> 01:13:52,861
Who are they Mason?

675
01:13:53,716 --> 01:13:55,129
Where is it?

676
01:13:55,164 --> 01:13:57,534
Poses. You had
me at all the same poses.

677
01:13:58,469 --> 01:13:59,687
Where is it?

678
01:13:59,722 --> 01:14:01,742
It's the last pose..

679
01:14:02,619 --> 01:14:06,144
Why is it ripped out?
- Where is the other one?

680
01:14:06,481 --> 01:14:08,267
WHERE IS IT?!

681
01:14:33,631 --> 01:14:35,576
You should have never...

682
01:14:51,098 --> 01:14:53,716
Why did you do that?

683
01:15:07,709 --> 01:15:10,592
No one sees them before they're done.

684
01:15:32,725 --> 01:15:35,664
You can't leave now.

685
01:15:36,988 --> 01:15:38,611
Sit down.

686
01:15:39,863 --> 01:15:41,556
Just keep sitting.

687
01:15:41,867 --> 01:15:46,822
Mason, please don't do this.
- You should have just listened to the rules.

688
01:15:47,076 --> 01:15:49,719
Mason, Mason.
- Shut up! Shut up!

689
01:15:51,721 --> 01:15:54,778
You knew that there were rules.

690
01:16:10,007 --> 01:16:13,556
I wanted you to be the one.

691
01:16:37,722 --> 01:16:39,549
I'm sorry!

692
01:17:22,238 --> 01:17:23,832
What's going on here?

693
01:17:32,006 --> 01:17:34,990
Shut up.
Everybody just relax.

694
01:17:35,353 --> 01:17:39,161
Just another damn power outage,
the emergency lights are gonna come back..

695
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:43,349
You see? There's nothing to worry about.
- I need help.

696
01:17:47,066 --> 01:17:49,869
What the hell are you doing?
It's alright. He's alright.

697
01:17:50,155 --> 01:17:51,786
Come here.

698
01:17:51,849 --> 01:17:54,221
What's the matter with you? huh?

699
01:17:54,395 --> 01:17:57,334
You trying to get us both fired?
Are you out of your mind?

700
01:17:57,364 --> 01:17:59,103
Showing up to work late is one thing.

701
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:02,959
Showing up to work like a psychopath
is another. Into my office.

702
01:18:03,873 --> 01:18:05,618
What the hell happened to you?

703
01:18:07,347 --> 01:18:09,501
Look at me.
Where's your inhaler?

704
01:18:09,927 --> 01:18:12,055
Where is your inhaler?

705
01:18:15,586 --> 01:18:16,648
Come here.

706
01:18:23,726 --> 01:18:25,853
What am I paying you to stand
with your thumb in your ass?

707
01:18:25,888 --> 01:18:28,058
Is he alright?
- Close the door!

708
01:18:29,986 --> 01:18:32,318
It's the last time Mason,
I swear to god.

709
01:18:32,536 --> 01:18:34,569
She went through my things.

710
01:18:34,604 --> 01:18:38,574
I don't give a shit. I told you, 
you have to deal with your own bullshit problems.

711
01:18:38,609 --> 01:18:41,830
She found out about the others.
- What others Mason?

712
01:18:43,954 --> 01:18:47,026
What the hell are we talking about here?
The waitress?

713
01:18:47,061 --> 01:18:50,660
The one that would come up to your apartment 
and let you paint sexy pictures of her?

714
01:18:50,772 --> 01:18:53,688
Or.. who was before that, maybe
it was her huh? The..

715
01:18:53,736 --> 01:18:55,877
The Spanish one. The poet?

716
01:18:56,168 --> 01:18:58,865
Or maybe it was the girl you 
met in the laundry room, that chick Korean. 

717
01:18:58,887 --> 01:19:02,052
Don't you get it?
You pathetic little shit.

718
01:19:04,065 --> 01:19:07,680
None of them. Are real.

719
01:19:09,324 --> 01:19:15,681
They don't exist. You made them up, 
you always make them up. It keeps you happy.

720
01:19:17,859 --> 01:19:22,980
But Amber..
- Amber who? Contrast girl?

721
01:19:23,015 --> 01:19:26,398
The one who works here? the one that 
was at my party? Why have I never met this girl?

722
01:19:26,418 --> 01:19:28,033
Did you ever stop to think about that?

723
01:19:28,051 --> 01:19:32,613
You ever see anyone smile at her? Talk to her? 
Seen anyone move out of her way? Hold the door for her?

724
01:19:32,614 --> 01:19:34,978
But I killed her!

725
01:19:39,768 --> 01:19:42,322
I've never seen hands covered in blood Mason.

726
01:19:44,475 --> 01:19:47,338
But I've seen hands covered in paint.

727
01:19:47,396 --> 01:19:50,286
Must've seen yours like that 
a dozen times.

728
01:19:53,474 --> 01:19:56,559
No, it's real.
- You didn't kill anyone Mason!

729
01:19:56,775 --> 01:20:00,393
Your dad did. 
A long time ago, and I wish that he hadn't.

730
01:20:00,495 --> 01:20:03,709
I wish that they had fried his ass 20
years ago,

731
01:20:03,884 --> 01:20:06,921
So this still wasn't an open wound for you,
but I'm not God Mason.

732
01:20:08,194 --> 01:20:10,477
I got problems of my own, you know?

733
01:20:26,536 --> 01:20:28,841
What am I gonna do?

734
01:20:29,967 --> 01:20:32,175
You're gonna take another hit off that thing.

735
01:20:32,772 --> 01:20:35,980
You're gonna go get cleaned up,
and you're gonna calm down.

736
01:20:41,323 --> 01:20:42,811
What are you going to do?

737
01:20:47,634 --> 01:20:49,425
I'm gonna take a hit.

738
01:20:52,423 --> 01:20:54,821
And get cleaned up.

739
01:20:55,067 --> 01:20:56,813
And calm down.

740
01:20:59,642 --> 01:21:02,839
I'm gonna stay right here and 
take care of a little business, okay?

741
01:21:27,175 --> 01:21:30,535
None of them are real?

742
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:33,733
None of them are real buddy.

743
01:21:36,819 --> 01:21:40,230
How can you tell the difference?

744
01:22:28,437 --> 01:22:31,455
Yeah whatever,
that's not my problem.

745
01:22:32,104 --> 01:22:34,101
How the hell am I supposed to know?
You're the doctor.

746
01:22:34,465 --> 01:22:37,199
Just send someone over here
as soon as you can.

747
01:22:43,390 --> 01:22:47,577
I heard there was some 
excitement down here this morning.

748
01:22:47,985 --> 01:22:52,485
Yeah you know, damn power outages.
- Right...

749
01:22:53,184 --> 01:22:56,102
Hey whatever. He's harmless.
He just has problems.

750
01:22:57,706 --> 01:23:01,080
We all got problems.
That guy needs help.

751
01:23:01,424 --> 01:23:05,335
I know.
Did you catch the game last night?

752
01:23:06,062 --> 01:23:10,231
Are you kidding? I stopped
watching when Drexler stopped playing.

753
01:23:15,117 --> 01:23:17,445
So how's life up on the
third floor treating you?

754
01:23:17,571 --> 01:23:21,672
I was happier when I worked 
down here for minimum wage.

755
01:23:21,770 --> 01:23:25,413
Your manager salary isn't
worth this shit they put you through.

756
01:23:25,542 --> 01:23:27,220
Tell me about it.

757
01:23:29,803 --> 01:23:31,413
Actually, that's why I came down here..

758
01:23:31,730 --> 01:23:34,168
One of my girls didn't show
up for her shift this morning..

759
01:23:34,203 --> 01:23:36,943
Her mom called me up looking for her.
- Her mom?

760
01:23:37,107 --> 01:23:39,625
I guess she didn't
come home last night.

761
01:23:39,660 --> 01:23:42,381
Hate it when we're damn babysitters.

762
01:23:42,461 --> 01:23:46,314
Anyway.. I'm sure this is the last 
conversation you want to have right now, but

763
01:23:46,636 --> 01:23:50,960
I've seen your severely troubled friend
talking to Amber a few times.

764
01:23:50,995 --> 01:23:53,772
Maybe you could ask him
if he's seen her.

765
01:23:54,192 --> 01:23:56,401
What did you just say?

766
01:25:49,419 --> 01:25:51,407
She's pretty.

767
01:25:51,442 --> 01:25:53,051
Who is she?

768
01:25:54,921 --> 01:25:57,265
She is..

769
01:25:58,834 --> 01:26:00,643
Nobody.
