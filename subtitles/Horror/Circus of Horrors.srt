1
00:00:08,968 --> 00:00:11,388

2
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,712

3
00:00:45,922 --> 00:00:48,466

4
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:51,761
Who's that?
I'm not expecting visitors.

5
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:59,060
It's the sad clown!
I painted his face!

6
00:01:02,981 --> 00:01:06,109

7
00:01:06,276 --> 00:01:09,237

8
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:11,030

9
00:01:11,197 --> 00:01:13,533
<i>- Damn them.
- Not again!</i>

10
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:17,912
<i>- What do we do?
- The dress routine, okay?</i>

11
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,373
Hey, blue face!

12
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:23,168

13
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:25,879

14
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:35,305

15
00:01:42,604 --> 00:01:45,690
- Okay, show's over!

16
00:01:45,857 --> 00:01:47,484
- If you can carry a weapon,

17
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,235
get into the trucks!

18
00:01:49,402 --> 00:01:52,197
You've been recruited
into the 11th Division

19
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:56,451
of the Republican Army commanded
by Col. Enrique Lister!

20
00:01:56,618 --> 00:02:00,914
Hey, can't you see we're working here?
The place is full of children.

21
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,165
Goddammit!

22
00:02:02,332 --> 00:02:04,751
<i>- Take it easy.
- Easy?</i>

23
00:02:04,918 --> 00:02:07,462
When he just barges in here
as if he runs the place?

24
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:11,800
Actually,
I do run this place.

25
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:15,136
And you, clown,
are coming with us.

26
00:02:16,596 --> 00:02:18,598
If you're not with us,

27
00:02:18,765 --> 00:02:20,725
you're with the rebels!

28
00:02:25,063 --> 00:02:27,023
Are you
with the rebels, clown?

29
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,484
I'm not with anyone.
I'm working.

30
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:32,904
Listen to him. Always joking!
Tell him you're joking.

31
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:37,283
Joking? I tell you, this fucking war's
a joke! A bad one!

32
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,370
<i>- Jesus, Manuel! Apologize.</i>

33
00:02:40,537 --> 00:02:42,622
Why should
I apologize to anyone?

34
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:46,167
Especially this ridiculous asshole,
hiding behind his gun...

35
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:50,839
I like your friend.

36
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:52,841
He's got balls.

37
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:59,138
But balls alone
don't win wars!

38
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:03,309
You need discipline,
dammit!

39
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:07,981
Right, then.
To hell with it.

40
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:10,608
If you're up for it, follow me.
Let's get going!

41
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:12,902
<i>-</i> What about the animals?

42
00:03:14,988 --> 00:03:16,990
I want to go
with you!

43
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:19,868
Wait for me
at Aunt Angeline's house.

44
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:22,829

45
00:03:22,996 --> 00:03:24,330
Soldier:
Hurry, hurry!

46
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,505

47
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:42,307

48
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:33,858
THE LAST CIRCUS

49
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:49,475

50
00:05:52,812 --> 00:05:54,272
Open Up!

51
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:56,899
Jesus wept!

52
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:00,653
Jesus wept!

53
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,196
Hats off!

54
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:04,907
Oh, God.

55
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:11,372
<i>-</i> What's this?

56
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:14,000
<i>- Can't you see it's a woman?
- But, the beard...</i>

57
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:17,462
Christ!
On your way, lady.

58
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:21,591
- Right...
<i>-</i> Here they come!

59
00:06:21,758 --> 00:06:23,718
<i>-</i> Hurry up, they're here!
- Okay, damn it!

60
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:26,387
Right.
Here's the plan.

61
00:06:26,554 --> 00:06:28,931
We open that door and kill the people
on the other side.

62
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:32,018
Otherwise, they'll kill us.
Simple as that.

63
00:06:32,185 --> 00:06:34,187
- With this?
<i>-</i> What?

64
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:35,938
Think it's a toy,
do you?

65
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:37,315
No, but...

66
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:39,358
You, clown,
give him your rifle.

67
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:44,947
When those fascist bastards
are eating your guts,

68
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:48,159
you'll be eating your words,
you useless prick!

69
00:06:48,326 --> 00:06:50,870
Hand-to-hand combat
is the key to survival.

70
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:56,375
<i>-</i> Any objections, clown?
- No.

71
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,252
Okay, good man.

72
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:00,463
<i>- I like you.
- Just one question.</i>

73
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,049
- What?
<i>-</i> Can I change clothes?

74
00:07:03,216 --> 00:07:05,718
No.

75
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:07,762
A clown
with a machete...

76
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:09,347
You'll scare
the shit out of them.

77
00:07:11,224 --> 00:07:13,768
Let's go! Show 'em what
you're made of!

78
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:16,896

79
00:07:17,063 --> 00:07:18,272
Bastards!

80
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,274
Let's get 'em!

81
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:45,299

82
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:49,095
Holy shit!

83
00:07:49,262 --> 00:07:50,388
C'mon, clown!

84
00:07:50,555 --> 00:07:51,806
Motherfuckers!

85
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:10,950
I can't see anything.

86
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:13,161
Am I wounded?

87
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:39,645

88
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:57,413

89
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:06,547
Man:
Attention!

90
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:09,217
Salute!

91
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:14,180

92
00:09:14,347 --> 00:09:16,265
Man:
At ease!

93
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:17,892

94
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:21,145
Stop.

95
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:23,606
Leave him.

96
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,153
So this is what wiped out
my whole regiment?

97
00:09:35,243 --> 00:09:36,285
Very funny.

98
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:41,123
Now the real fun begins.

99
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,210
Ready!

100
00:09:44,377 --> 00:09:45,753
Load!

101
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,088
Aim!

102
00:09:47,255 --> 00:09:49,006
<i>-</i> - Fire!

103
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:55,846

104
00:10:18,411 --> 00:10:21,706
Off limits, kid.
Go back to your parents.

105
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:23,457
I can't find my dad.

106
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:26,794
Listen, kid...
You'd best go home.

107
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:28,170
I want to see my dad.

108
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:29,630
How do you know
he's a prisoner?

109
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:31,882
He didn't do anything.
He worked in the circus.

110
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:35,094
<i>- You're the clown's kid?
- Will he be shot?</i>

111
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:43,519
Long live
the Republic!

112
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:45,438
Long live
the circus!

113
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:54,739

114
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:56,365
Dad!

115
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:04,665
I told you to go
to Aunt Angeline's house.

116
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:06,876
I want to be with you.

117
00:11:07,043 --> 00:11:08,627
Listen.

118
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:11,297
There's nothing
to worry about.

119
00:11:11,464 --> 00:11:14,800
I doubt they'll kill me.
We're being kept prisoner.

120
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:16,594
Honest?

121
00:11:16,761 --> 00:11:20,222
They need labor.
Workers.

122
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:21,599
It's okay.

123
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:24,310
A month from now,
we'll be together,

124
00:11:24,477 --> 00:11:26,687
eating a nice
Sunday roast.

125
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:29,565
<i>- You'll see.</i>

126
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:31,192
Come on, time's up.

127
00:11:43,788 --> 00:11:45,456
THE WAR <i>IS OVER!</i>

128
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,690
<i>LONG LIVE SPAIN!</i>

129
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:26,956
Dad.

130
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,460
You look awful.

131
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:34,797
That's funny.
They treat us like royalty

132
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:37,550
Don't say that.

133
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:39,760
My poor son.

134
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:41,429
Life's been cruel
to you.

135
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,639
You never knew
your mother,

136
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:45,599
your dad's going
to die in jail.

137
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:48,394
One day you'll be free.
You're here for a reason, you said.

138
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:51,564
So they say.
We're going to build a cross.

139
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,274
A huge cross.

140
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:56,944
It can't be worse
than this.

141
00:12:57,111 --> 00:12:59,280
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

142
00:12:59,447 --> 00:13:01,365
Why do you ask?

143
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:02,867
A clown?

144
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:05,453
Of course. Like you,
Granddad, everyone.

145
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:06,787
A funny clown?

146
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:09,248
Yeah.
To make kids laugh.

147
00:13:09,415 --> 00:13:10,749
No.

148
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,585
You should be
a sad clown.

149
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,795
Why?

150
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:17,465
Because you've
suffered too much.

151
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:21,510
Son, you'll never be funny.
You were never a kid.

152
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:24,346
Since childhood,
you've faced death.

153
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:26,974
Your lot is
to be the sad clown,

154
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:29,643
with bushy eyebrows
and a little saxophone.

155
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,730
The funny clown's sidekick,
who laughs at his jokes.

156
00:13:32,897 --> 00:13:35,816
If I can't make people laugh,
no one will ever love me.

157
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,401
Don't say that.

158
00:13:40,196 --> 00:13:41,822
Wait.

159
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:44,450
There's a way
to be happy,

160
00:13:44,617 --> 00:13:46,160
to thwart your fate.

161
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:47,578
How? What can I do?

162
00:13:47,745 --> 00:13:49,622
Revenge.

163
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:51,832
Ease your pain
with revenge.

164
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,961
Revenge!

165
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:59,173
Revenge!

166
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:07,890

167
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,821

168
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,294
Man:
Come on, dammit!

169
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:49,974
What are you doing?

170

Pompoff

Been in the job long?

No. My dad

No.

Too bad.

207
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:31,635
Well, not every gag
has to be a side-splitter.

Fantastic!

The Ghost Biker.
They changed his bike.

You sure?
It's not too flashy?

223
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:18,390
Ghosts are supposed to be flashy.
Have you tried the turbo?

224
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:21,727
It needs adjusting.
Is that the new guy?

Hi! Javier.

227
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:26,231
Sad clown!

228

See? He gets
a snazzy outfit.

229
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:30,694
Why won't they
let me wear sequins?

230
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:35,407
Because you're a tough guy!
You're the Ghost Biker!

231
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:36,825
You wear leather!

232
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:39,328

233

<i>-</i> Charlton Heston wore leather?

<i>- Have you fed them?

236

<i>-</i> I wanted a seal.

237
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:50,214
<i>- We can't afford seals.
- One would have been enough.</i>

238
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,466
Ignore him,
he's a pain.

239
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:55,052
<i>- A seal and a ball.
- You haven't got any balls either.</i>

240
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:56,678
Don't mind him.

241
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:58,555
<i>- Always barking.
- Who, me?</i>

242
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:01,266
No, the dogs.
And they sleep with us.

243
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:03,435
Do you have to tell him
our life story?

244
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:04,812
It's true.

245
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:08,148
They sleep in our bed.
That's not normal.

246
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:09,775
<i>- Come here.
- Let's go.</i>

247
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:12,277

248
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:14,738
The turbo,
it needs adjusting!

249
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:16,323
Have you met
my elephant?

250
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,617
I haven't had time,
I was getting ready...

251
00:19:18,784 --> 00:19:21,078
This is Princess.
She's a sweetie.

252
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:23,831

253
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:26,959

254
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,753
She gets jealous
if she sees me with women.

255
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,297
And your outfit...
She must have thought...

256
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:49,356
Beautiful,
isn't she?

257
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,446
Hey... Careful,
she belongs to someone else.

258
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:57,990
Your boss,
no less.

259
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:23,932

260
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:33,066
Man: Damn, I'm sick
of fucking midgets!

261
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,402
Their bowed legs,
oversized heads, Jesus!

262
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:38,906
<i>- Every circus has midgets.
- Mine doesn't.</i>

263
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,575
Man #2:
This isn't your circus. It's mine.

264
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:44,995
Are you sure?

265
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:48,332
Sergio... You've no right
to talk to me like this.

266
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:51,752
Fire me.
What are you waiting for?

267
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:54,880
We'll talk later.

268
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:57,007
Whenever.

269
00:20:57,174 --> 00:21:00,552
And then we'll settle things

270
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,723
I've told him
a million times.

271
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,351
This circus
doesn't need midgets.

272
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:08,977
He never listens.

273
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:12,397
What do you want?

274
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:14,024
I'd like you
to meet Javier.

275
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:17,027
He's our new sad clown,
starts tomorrow.

276
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:19,279
<i>-</i> You into kids?
- Excuse me?

277
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:21,323
I don't mean
kiddie porn.

278
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:26,370
Do you like working
with them?

279
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:29,206
Are you patient, kind?

280
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:31,708
<i>-</i> I'll do what you tell me.
- Not good enough!

281
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:38,006
Kids need care
and understanding.

282
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:39,800
You have to
become one.

283
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:41,593
He's like
a little boy.

284
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,889
Aren't you? Look at him.
With his chubby cheeks.

285
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:47,724

286
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:50,435
So, tell me.

287
00:21:51,937 --> 00:21:53,730
Why do you want
to be a clown?

288
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:56,316
Think.

289
00:21:57,901 --> 00:21:59,444

290
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:01,613
Spit it out!

291
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,908
What did I ask you?
Why do you want to be a clown?

292
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:07,828
You must have
a reason.

293
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:10,080
People don't just
become clowns.

294
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:12,749
Let's see.

295
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,627
Because life scares you?

296
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:20,882
Your parents were clowns?

297
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:23,468
You like being humiliated?

298
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:24,970
What about you?

299
00:22:26,722 --> 00:22:29,641
Because if I weren't a clown,
I'd be a murderer.

300
00:22:32,144 --> 00:22:34,104
Me too.

301
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:46,241
You're all we've got.
You start tomorrow.

302
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:49,536
<i>- Welcome to the circus, kid.</i>

303
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:51,788

304
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:06,595
You invited him?

305
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:09,556
Yeah, he doesn't
know anyone...

306
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:13,060
- The dogs love him.
<i>-</i> They want to hump him.

307
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,979
Reminds me of the joke about the father
in the maternity ward.

308
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:17,397
<i>-</i> Heard it?
- No.

309
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:19,524
<i>- It's hilarious.
- Shut it.</i>

310
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:22,194
The father goes in,
there are babies everywhere,

311
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,154
he's looking for his.

312
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:25,614
The nurse points to one.

313
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:28,867
He starts crying with joy.
"My baby..."

314
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:31,870
The nurse wraps it up in a
little sheet

315
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:33,663
and shows it to him.

316
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:38,085
"Oh, my baby, he's so cute..."
And the nurse goes...

317
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,716
Right in the dad's face.

318
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:47,552
"Oh my God!
What have you done?

319
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:49,012
You killed my baby!
You killed him!"

320
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:51,681
And the nurse says,
"No, I didn't.

321
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:53,100
It was born dead."

322
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:55,018

323
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:57,437
"it was born dead!"

324
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,361
Hilarious!

325
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:07,155
Sergio:
Good one, eh?

326
00:24:07,322 --> 00:24:09,407
"It was born dead!"

327
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:12,369
So who gives a shit?

328
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:19,501
<i>-</i> Don't you think it's funny?

329
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:22,462
I don't get it.
Where was the mother?

330
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:29,052
What mother?

331
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:31,847
The mother.

332
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:38,520
Who said
there's a mother?

333

So far, so good. The kids laugh

Success!

He looks serious, scared of me.
I like that.

The way you stared him down

And as you talked to the kids
and he set fire to your butt...

You didn't even flinch.
That studied passivity

reminds me
of Buster Keaton! Really!

Take me to dinner in Madrid later

00:34:07,964 --> 00:34:09,882

498
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:12,135

499
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:26,482
<i>-</i> What are you doing?
- Shh!

500
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,363
What's going on?

501
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:38,494

502
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:48,463
This is wrong.

503
00:34:56,053 --> 00:34:58,514

504
00:34:58,681 --> 00:35:01,142
<i>-</i> Are you scared?
- Yes.

505
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:03,519
Fear spices things up.

506
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:04,937

507
00:35:08,024 --> 00:35:10,151
You're like a kid.

508
00:35:10,318 --> 00:35:12,361
I was never a kid.

509
00:35:16,032 --> 00:35:17,742

510
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:19,535
I don't understand.
Who's Blue Beard?

511
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:22,455
<i>- That's not the point.
- But you were in her trailer?</i>

512
00:35:22,622 --> 00:35:26,125
- Yeah, well...
<i>-</i> So what's the problem?

513
00:35:26,292 --> 00:35:30,046
She's toying with me.
She just wants to be friends.

514
00:35:30,213 --> 00:35:32,215
Wake up, sunshine.

515
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:35,635
If a woman invites you to be her friend,
you'll never screw her.

516
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:37,512
Sure, like you're
an expert.

517
00:35:37,678 --> 00:35:38,805
I was married, Javier.

518
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:40,890
<i>-</i> She left you?
- No.

519
00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:44,268
Princess killed her.

520
00:35:44,435 --> 00:35:48,231
She sat on her,
and crushed her to death.

521
00:35:48,397 --> 00:35:49,982
Right.

522
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:53,653
I told you she hates seeing me
with other women.

523
00:35:55,238 --> 00:35:56,489
Listen, kid.

524
00:35:56,656 --> 00:35:58,866
Let me tell you:
you're doing great.

525
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:01,911
<i>- You think?
- Yeah, you're very good.</i>

526
00:36:02,078 --> 00:36:03,371
You can tell
it's in your blood.

527
00:36:03,538 --> 00:36:05,957
- Fixed the turbo?
<i>-</i> Yeah, don't be a pain.

528
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:08,668
<i>- You sure? If it happens again...
- Come on.</i>

529
00:36:08,835 --> 00:36:11,337
- My father...
- I met him once when I was a kid.

530
00:36:11,504 --> 00:36:12,922
<i>- He was great.
- Yeah.</i>

531
00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:15,591
<i>- Remember the door routine?
- Of course.</i>

532
00:36:15,758 --> 00:36:16,926
Were you with my girl
last night?

533
00:36:17,093 --> 00:36:18,469
What?

534
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,889
When I got home,
she wasn't in bed.

535
00:36:22,056 --> 00:36:24,600
I heard you went out with her.
Maybe you know where she was.

536
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:26,644
I didn't see her.

537
00:36:29,939 --> 00:36:31,858
No. I didn't see her.

538
00:36:33,776 --> 00:36:36,988
I don't know
where she was.

539
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:40,783
I was doing things...

540
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:47,707
I might have run into her,
I don't remember...

541
00:36:47,874 --> 00:36:50,835
Javier.
That's your name, right?

542
00:36:51,002 --> 00:36:52,628
- Yeah.
<i>-</i> Look.

543
00:36:52,795 --> 00:36:55,715
Natalia means
everything to me.

544
00:36:55,882 --> 00:36:58,384
I'd do anything for her.

545
00:36:58,551 --> 00:37:00,887
Anything, Javier.

546
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:04,015

547
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:07,685
Javier.

548
00:37:07,852 --> 00:37:09,812
<i>- Listen.</i>

549
00:37:09,979 --> 00:37:12,940
Sometimes I drink too much
and lose control.

550
00:37:14,317 --> 00:37:16,277
But I'm not
a bad person, Javier.

551
00:37:17,904 --> 00:37:19,780
I love Natalia deeply.

552
00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:22,700
True love.

553
00:37:22,867 --> 00:37:25,620
<i>- True love.
- True love, Javier.</i>

554
00:37:25,786 --> 00:37:28,080
You're on.
Let's go.

555
00:37:34,837 --> 00:37:37,506

556
00:37:41,802 --> 00:37:44,263
What a team!

557
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:46,933
Now it's elephant time.
What do elephants do?

558
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:48,434

559
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:51,312
What do elephants do?

560
00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:53,731
He's different
when things are going well.

561
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:56,817
You mean
he beats you less.

562
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,986
Don't say that.

563
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:02,907
I love him
too much sometimes.

564
00:38:03,074 --> 00:38:04,617
You can
say that again.

565
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:07,870
Any other girl
would run away from that.

566
00:38:08,037 --> 00:38:09,997
Look, Natalia.
It's not normal.

567
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:12,708
Have you never
felt trapped by a love

568
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:14,919
you know might kill you,

569
00:38:15,086 --> 00:38:17,088
but you still
can't help yourself?

570
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:19,256
Yes, every day.

571
00:38:19,423 --> 00:38:22,677
This circus will be
the end of me.

572
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:24,637
See?

573
00:38:24,804 --> 00:38:26,764
We're two of a kind.

574
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:30,184
If I hadn't met him...

575
00:38:30,351 --> 00:38:32,770
<i>-</i> If he disappeared...

576
00:38:32,937 --> 00:38:36,023
Don't even joke about that.
We'd be sunk without him.

577
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,567
He's the best clown
I've had in years.

578
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:41,946
Look at him.
The kids adore him.

579
00:38:42,113 --> 00:38:44,448
Sergio:
Who wants to ride with me?

580
00:38:44,615 --> 00:38:46,117
We're a hit!

581
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:47,827
We'll be in the paper!

582
00:38:47,994 --> 00:38:50,913
We're staying an extra week.
Good work!

583
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,000
<i>-</i> Can he have a ride?
- Of course, ma'am.

584
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:57,128
And now the sad clown will
hop on with this baby

585
00:38:57,294 --> 00:39:00,673
for a ride on the elephant!
Let's hear it for the sad clown!

586
00:39:02,633 --> 00:39:05,553
<i>- Hurry up, asshole.
- It's too far.</i>

587
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,264
A big hand
for the sad clown!

588
00:39:08,431 --> 00:39:10,141
Pass him over.

589
00:39:10,307 --> 00:39:12,143
<i>- It's too far.
- Come on.</i>

590
00:39:13,728 --> 00:39:18,482
The sad clown's got cold feet!
Pass me the kid.

591
00:39:18,649 --> 00:39:20,109
The elephant's moved away.

592
00:39:20,276 --> 00:39:22,194
The sad clown is scared!

593
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:24,321
<i>- Javier: I can't reach.
- Sergio: Come on!</i>

594
00:39:24,488 --> 00:39:27,241
I can't reach.
She needs to come closer.

595
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:29,410
Do it, asshole!

596
00:39:29,577 --> 00:39:30,745
<i>-</i> Throw me that kid!

597
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:34,123

598
00:39:38,002 --> 00:39:40,546
I'm really sorry, ma'am.

599
00:39:40,713 --> 00:39:42,423
I'm sorry, love.

600
00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:57,521
If a child gets hurt, I'll kill you.
You got that?

601
00:39:57,688 --> 00:40:00,149
Children are
our livelihood.

602
00:40:08,783 --> 00:40:09,950

603
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:14,997
You Okay?

604
00:40:15,164 --> 00:40:18,042
Better.
Panic's over.

605
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:21,003
<i>-</i> Will you take me to the fun fair?
- Where?

606
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:24,799
Ferris wheel, carousel,
cotton candy...

607
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:26,217
Paris...

608
00:40:26,383 --> 00:40:28,719
We can dine out, have fun,
like the other day.

609
00:40:28,886 --> 00:40:30,721
Are you crazy?
What about Sergio?

610
00:40:30,888 --> 00:40:34,767
Sergio got drunk, went to bed at five.
He won't be up until morning.

611
00:40:34,934 --> 00:40:37,853
- You sure?
<i>-</i> Not entirely.

612
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,606
He could wake up,

613
00:40:40,773 --> 00:40:44,735
come looking for us,
find us...

614
00:40:44,902 --> 00:40:47,321
and kill us both!

615
00:40:47,488 --> 00:40:51,617
<i>-</i> You have to take risks in life.
- Yeah, but...

616
00:40:51,784 --> 00:40:54,286
There are risks
and there are risks...

617
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:56,997
My baby's scared!

618
00:40:58,457 --> 00:41:01,001
Why are you doing this?
Why me?

619
00:41:01,168 --> 00:41:02,545
Am I a joke to you?

620
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:04,004
No.

621
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:05,756
$0?

622
00:41:08,384 --> 00:41:10,678
I don't know.

623
00:41:12,388 --> 00:41:14,056
With you it's different.

624
00:41:15,558 --> 00:41:17,184
I feel safe.

625
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:24,567

626
00:41:37,288 --> 00:41:39,248

627
00:41:55,556 --> 00:41:57,183

628
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:07,401
Javier: Thanks.

629
00:42:07,568 --> 00:42:10,070
<i>-</i> Hey, listen...
- What?

630
00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:14,909
I know for you this is like a day out
with your nephew,

631
00:42:15,075 --> 00:42:18,787
but I want you to know
these things really affect me.

632
00:42:18,954 --> 00:42:20,414
What do you mean?

633
00:42:20,581 --> 00:42:22,166
That I could end up
loving you.

634
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:24,543
Loving me?
How much?

635
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:27,338
A lot.
More than a lot.

636
00:42:29,673 --> 00:42:33,552
Don't! I'd rather never see you again
than be treated like this.

637
00:42:34,929 --> 00:42:36,513
Don't you see?

638
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,099
You're the only one
who stood up to him.

639
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:42,061
You didn't laugh
at his jokes.

640
00:42:42,228 --> 00:42:44,563
That's what
I call a real man.

641
00:43:00,746 --> 00:43:02,831

642
00:43:04,917 --> 00:43:07,002

643
00:43:11,632 --> 00:43:14,051

644
00:43:23,102 --> 00:43:25,312
-Oh!

645
00:43:29,316 --> 00:43:30,567
Cock of the roost, eh?

646
00:43:30,734 --> 00:43:32,903
Full of yourself.

647
00:43:34,863 --> 00:43:37,783
Sergio, it's my fault.
I made him come...

648
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:41,036

649
00:43:42,746 --> 00:43:44,623
<i>- No, Sergio!</i>

650
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:47,710
No, Sergio!
Let her go!

651
00:43:47,876 --> 00:43:50,087
Don't worry.

652
00:43:50,254 --> 00:43:53,382
Be patient. I'll be back for you
when I've left her in the car.

653
00:43:53,549 --> 00:43:56,510
I won't
let you take her.

654
00:43:56,677 --> 00:43:59,430
Man, this is good.
We can use it in our act.

655
00:43:59,596 --> 00:44:02,516
You stand up to me
and I beat the shit out of you.

656
00:44:02,683 --> 00:44:05,728
You say you love her,
but one day you'll kill her.

657
00:44:05,894 --> 00:44:08,188
What do you know
about love?

658
00:44:08,355 --> 00:44:10,316

659

827
00:57:34,702 --> 00:57:37,705
<i>has given the police the slip.
After his arrest in Seville,</i>

828
00:57:37,872 --> 00:57:39,874
<i>"el Lute " was taken to
the prison hospital in Madrid</i>

829
00:57:40,041 --> 00:57:42,585
<i>where he was treated
for multiple injuries.</i>

830
00:57:44,879 --> 00:57:47,340
It's over.

831
00:57:47,507 --> 00:57:50,802
No news from Javier.
Nothing from Sergio.

832
00:57:50,969 --> 00:57:52,637
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

833
00:57:56,015 --> 00:57:58,434
The tour's been canceled.

834
00:57:58,601 --> 00:58:01,146
I can't pay the bills.

835
00:58:01,312 --> 00:58:03,148
I have to close down.

836
00:58:03,314 --> 00:58:06,067
Waiter!
An espresso, please.

837
00:58:06,234 --> 00:58:08,695
- Waiter: Hot milk or cold?
- Owner: Warm.

838
00:58:12,365 --> 00:58:14,868
We'll just have to do
something else.

839
00:58:15,034 --> 00:58:16,744
Any ideas?

840
00:58:16,911 --> 00:58:18,454
No.

841
00:58:19,581 --> 00:58:22,167
Why don't you sell
the animals?

842
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:23,501
They're not mine.

843
00:58:23,668 --> 00:58:25,837
I've got nothing.
Just debts.

844
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:33,720
Then... we'll just have
to make beds or scrub floors.

845
00:58:33,887 --> 00:58:35,680
Don't worry, woman.

846
00:58:35,847 --> 00:58:38,808
I'm sure we'll come up
with something better.

847
00:59:01,414 --> 00:59:02,999

848
00:59:05,668 --> 00:59:08,004

849
00:59:29,651 --> 00:59:32,612
I don't believe it!

850
00:59:32,779 --> 00:59:35,448
He looks like an animal.
Eh, Colonel?

851
00:59:36,491 --> 00:59:37,700
Put him
in the Land Rover.

852
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:43,331
In you go!

853
00:59:43,498 --> 00:59:46,000
Come on, move it!

854
00:59:53,091 --> 00:59:55,218
We got lucky today,
Anselmo.

855
00:59:55,385 --> 00:59:57,136
We bagged
a unique specimen.

856
00:59:57,303 --> 01:00:00,390
The biggest boar
in the whole area, Colonel.

857
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,281
Take them
to the stables.

858
01:00:16,447 --> 01:00:18,825
<i>-</i> Both of them, Colonel?
- Both of them.

859
01:00:18,992 --> 01:00:20,952

860
01:00:24,289 --> 01:00:26,833
Hello?

861
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,502
Enrique!
How are you?

862
01:00:29,669 --> 01:00:32,130
No, impossible.

863
01:00:32,297 --> 01:00:33,965
You can't come.

864
01:00:34,132 --> 01:00:36,926
Tomorrow's the hunt.
I've a lot to prepare.

865
01:00:37,093 --> 01:00:41,639
I got a call from Franco's residence.
He wants to be alone, to relax.

866
01:00:41,806 --> 01:00:43,141
Bye, Enrique.

867
01:00:43,308 --> 01:00:45,518
Colonel, what do
I do with that man?

868
01:00:47,061 --> 01:00:50,231
Leave him for now.
Put him to work tomorrow.

869
01:00:50,398 --> 01:00:53,192
He's weird.
He doesn't speak.

870
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:55,194
Maybe he doesn't
know how.

871
01:00:56,237 --> 01:00:57,780
He knows all right.

872
01:00:57,947 --> 01:00:59,699
Off you go.

873
01:01:06,581 --> 01:01:08,666

874
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:23,890

875
01:01:31,022 --> 01:01:32,648
General.

876
01:01:32,815 --> 01:01:35,735
My dear Salcedo,
so good to see you again!

877
01:01:35,902 --> 01:01:37,653
Everything is
ready for the hunt.

878
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:41,282
The sooner I smell
gunpowder, the better.

879
01:01:45,536 --> 01:01:47,830
After you, General.

880
01:01:57,298 --> 01:01:59,717
- Come on!

881
01:02:01,803 --> 01:02:04,263
Get to work,
like everyone else!

882
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:07,100
Get a move on, dammit!

883
01:02:17,235 --> 01:02:18,694
What did I tell you?

884
01:02:18,861 --> 01:02:20,655
What did
I tell you, eh?

885
01:02:20,822 --> 01:02:22,281
The bird
in your mouth!

886
01:02:28,788 --> 01:02:31,290
- Come on!

887
01:02:35,086 --> 01:02:36,295

888
01:02:36,462 --> 01:02:37,839
Good boy.

889
01:02:38,005 --> 01:02:40,091
What on earth
are you doing?

890
01:02:40,258 --> 01:02:42,718
What's the poor man done
to be treated that way?

891
01:02:42,885 --> 01:02:47,014
A long time ago,
he made a fool out of me.

892
01:02:47,181 --> 01:02:50,226
He likes to joke around.
It runs in his family.

893
01:02:50,393 --> 01:02:54,188
Nobody deserves that.
It's not Christian, Salcedo.

894
01:02:54,355 --> 01:02:58,025
We've been friends for years,
but there are things about you I don't like.

895
01:02:58,192 --> 01:03:00,236
<i>-</i>- Right...

896
01:03:07,535 --> 01:03:09,412
Seems I hit
the mark this time!

897
01:03:15,501 --> 01:03:17,837
Don't tolerate this, lad.

898
01:03:18,004 --> 01:03:20,381
You shouldn't put up
with such humiliation.

899
01:03:20,548 --> 01:03:21,757
Get up now.

900
01:03:21,924 --> 01:03:23,968

901
01:03:26,053 --> 01:03:27,555
Call a doctor!

902
01:03:27,722 --> 01:03:29,474
Take him away!

903
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,767

904
01:03:36,105 --> 01:03:38,232

905
01:03:38,399 --> 01:03:40,485

907
01:03:51,537 --> 01:03:53,164

908
01:03:53,331 --> 01:03:55,708

909
01:03:55,875 --> 01:03:58,252
<i>You're the best thing
in my life</i>

910
01:03:58,419 --> 01:04:02,381
<i>Even if I never tell you</i>

911
01:04:02,548 --> 01:04:05,927
<i>If you're away, I'm sad</i>

912
01:04:06,093 --> 01:04:10,264
<i>I miss you at night,
I miss you during the day</i>

913
01:04:12,475 --> 01:04:15,895
<i>My heart is happy</i>

914
01:04:16,062 --> 01:04:19,941
<i>And full of joy</i>

915
01:04:20,107 --> 01:04:21,734
<i>My heart is happy</i>

916
01:04:21,901 --> 01:04:26,781
<i>Ever since
you entered my world</i>

917
01:04:26,948 --> 01:04:29,075
<i>And I thank life</i>

918
01:04:29,242 --> 01:04:33,621
<i>And pray to God
you'll always be with me</i>

919
01:04:34,956 --> 01:04:37,291
<i>I want you to know</i>

920
01:04:37,458 --> 01:04:40,127
<i>I never loved like this</i>

921
01:04:42,004 --> 01:04:45,716
<i>That my life began</i>

922
01:04:45,883 --> 01:04:48,135
<i>- When I met you...</i>

923
01:04:54,767 --> 01:04:57,228
Come on. Move it!

924
01:04:57,395 --> 01:04:59,730
I was wondering...

925
01:04:59,897 --> 01:05:02,567
<i>- Get inside!</i>

926
01:05:03,901 --> 01:05:05,861
You bit Franco.

927
01:05:06,028 --> 01:05:07,905
I could get
to like you after all.

928
01:05:08,072 --> 01:05:10,032
Shame you're
to be shot.

929
01:05:10,199 --> 01:05:13,494
Get some rest.
Salcedo wants to do it himself.

930
01:05:13,661 --> 01:05:15,913
You lucky devil!

931
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:18,916

932
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:47,695
The Day of Wrath is here.
You will be my Angel of Death.

933
01:05:47,862 --> 01:05:50,531
Save me from Evil and fulfill
your destiny, my beloved.

934
01:05:58,539 --> 01:05:59,832
A gunshot wound.

935
01:05:59,999 --> 01:06:02,418
It was an accident.

936
01:06:02,585 --> 01:06:04,754
We can't say
a lunatic bit him.

937
01:06:06,297 --> 01:06:10,217
Like any other vermin,
he'll be put down.

938
01:06:10,384 --> 01:06:12,386
And that's that.

939
01:06:12,553 --> 01:06:14,639
<i>-</i> Not until the Generalissimo

940
01:06:14,805 --> 01:06:16,140
has left the castle.

01:06:16,307 --> 01:06:18,225
Now's a bad time, Salcedo.

942
01:06:18,392 --> 01:06:19,644
And you know it.

943
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:21,604

Anselmo:
Weirdo! Weirdo! Weirdo!

950
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:22,206
Hey, weirdo, it's time.

951
01:07:23,999 --> 01:07:28,254
What are you dressed up as?
A priest or a lady?

952
01:07:28,421 --> 01:07:31,465
If the colonel sees you
dressed like that, he'll have a fit.

953

I don't know where you came from,

I thought
we controlled the press.

We're losing

the opposition is
getting organized.

of a plot to assassinate
Admiral Carrero Blanco.

970
01:09:09,021 --> 01:09:11,690
We know there's

1151

not me.

Is that all
that bothers you?

1158
01:20:36,875 --> 01:20:39,336
It bothers me
that you clammed up!

1159
01:20:39,503 --> 01:20:41,963
Why didn't you tell
the truth?

1160
01:20:42,130 --> 01:20:44,049

did this to me.

No.

Not that.

1167
01:21:04,027 --> 01:21:06,530

1169
01:21:14,412 --> 01:21:16,873
I don't know how to do anything else.

1170

Well, yeah.

I don't know.
I'm not telling you anything.

1223

He talked to Javier
and they took them to a hideout, right?

1224
01:26:00,281 --> 01:26:03,284
Where? An abandoned
warehouse, a basement...?

1225
01:26:03,451 --> 01:26:05,411
A cave?

1226

<i>- Who told you?
- You did, just now.</i>

But similar,
dug out of stone?

1231

<i>- A cave.

- Is it a church?
<i>-</i> No, it's not a church!

A church

1248
01:27:27,076 --> 01:27:30,872

All this ruckus means
Andrés was right.

Puzzles me how the police found out
Javier was hiding here.

1257

1262
01:28:12,914 --> 01:28:15,458
It's hard to dance
in these clown shoes.

1263
01:28:15,625 --> 01:28:19,003
I'm sorry about all this, Natalia,
but it's not my fault.

1264
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:20,338
I was told to do it.

1265
01:28:20,505 --> 01:28:21,839
- By who?
- Well...

1266
01:28:22,006 --> 01:28:25,551
He asked me, Raphael,
the singer. Look.

1267
01:28:27,971 --> 01:28:30,098
He told me.
Him and my dad.

1268
01:28:33,184 --> 01:28:36,938
<i>- I know you don't love me.
- Who told you that? Raphael?</i>

1269
01:28:37,105 --> 01:28:40,191
Maybe in time
I'll learn to pretend to be like Sergio.

1270
01:28:42,235 --> 01:28:46,406
You're well on your way.
I'm scared of you too now!

We found them.
There are tunnels under the church.

1279

Come on, let's go!

1280

Move it!
Move it! Move it!

1281

What the fuck

1282
01:29:36,539 --> 01:29:37,915
You're as mad
as the other guy!

1283
01:29:38,082 --> 01:29:41,127
Like all of you who just
dick around for a living!

1284
01:29:41,294 --> 01:29:45,923
Doing an honest day's work would
stop your bullshit. No messing around!

1285
01:29:46,966 --> 01:29:48,509
Lazy fucking bastard!

Ever been here?

1291
01:30:11,866 --> 01:30:14,452
There are 15 caves here,
full of bodies.

1292
01:30:15,536 --> 01:30:17,205
One of these has
to be my father.

1293
01:30:19,624 --> 01:30:22,126
Some fascists,
others reds.

1294

But they all
ended up here together.

Javier, stop this.
I'll do whatever you want.

1297
01:30:32,178 --> 01:30:36,307
Just one thing. Desire me,
for my body, like you desire him.

1298
01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:39,143
Well, well.

1299

do that again!

1302

Don't you dare feel
sorry for me! Never!

1303

I'd rather
you hated me.

1304

I'd like to hate you,
but I can't.

1305

I don't love
Sergio any more.

1306

01:31:01,415 --> 01:31:03,459
Like what? Crazy?

1309
01:31:03,626 --> 01:31:06,170
You drove me crazy,
Natalia!

1310
01:31:06,337 --> 01:31:08,714
You're crazy for me?

1311
01:31:08,881 --> 01:31:10,091

1312
01:31:10,258 --> 01:31:14,470
Is this
a declaration of love?

1313
01:31:14,637 --> 01:31:17,765
Yes. Yes, it is.

1314
01:31:17,932 --> 01:31:19,934
Yes, it is.

1315
01:31:20,101 --> 01:31:23,646
Because I love you, Natalia!
I'm mad about you!

1316
01:31:28,693 --> 01:31:30,611
Sergio:
How sweet!

1317
01:31:30,778 --> 01:31:32,029
Can I be the best man?

1318
01:31:32,196 --> 01:31:34,657
Run for it!
Head for the cross!

1319
01:31:34,824 --> 01:31:36,242

01:31:36,409 --> 01:31:38,327

Look!
They'll be killed!

1330

- Andrés: It's hopeless.
<i>-</i> Owner: There's nothing we can do.

1331
01:32:52,193 --> 01:32:54,278
We'd have to cross
the police cordon.

1332
01:32:54,445 --> 01:32:56,197
I can.
I can fly.

1333
01:32:56,364 --> 01:33:00,159
Isn't there a single one of us
who isn't completely nuts?

1334
01:33:00,326 --> 01:33:02,119
He did have
his turbo replaced.

1335
01:33:02,286 --> 01:33:03,746
Six cans
of pure gas oil,

1336
01:33:03,913 --> 01:33:05,790
three parts hydrogen
and one part helium.

1337
01:33:05,957 --> 01:33:07,708
Like a 747 jet engine.

1338
01:33:07,875 --> 01:33:10,378
I can break
the sound barrier!

1339
01:33:12,755 --> 01:33:14,840

1340
01:33:18,844 --> 01:33:20,680

-( bullets ricocheting )
- What are you doing?

1343
01:34:33,294 --> 01:34:34,712
It's the only way
to escape.

1344
01:34:34,879 --> 01:34:37,256
Let me.
It's my job, remember?

1345
01:34:37,423 --> 01:34:38,841
We're escaping together?

1346
01:34:39,008 --> 01:34:41,469
Yes, sweetie.
We're escaping together.

Get down! Get down!

<i>- Relax. It's a piece of cake.
- This is too much.</i>

It's not us, it's this country
that's gone to the dogs.

1355
01:36:03,926 --> 01:36:07,346
It's like a kick in the balls
losing your girl...

Isn't it?

1357
01:36:09,181 --> 01:36:10,850
It'll hurt even more
when you hit the ground.

1358
01:36:11,016 --> 01:36:12,935
Jump.

Jump, bastard.

Jump!

1364
01:36:29,368 --> 01:36:31,912
I can do it!
Let me get it right

01:36:32,079 --> 01:36:33,706
for once,
for fuck's sake!

See? In the end, I'm the smart one
and you're the dummy.

1374
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:15,623
Who cares if you're funny
when it's time to die?

1375
01:37:15,789 --> 01:37:17,416
You think death
is a joke?

Prove you've got

I don't want you to be like him.
You have to believe me.

You have to
believe me.
