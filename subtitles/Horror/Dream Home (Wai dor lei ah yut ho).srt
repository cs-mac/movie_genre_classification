1
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,010
Did you collude with Yeongae Somun

2
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,800
to kill me because you feared I would take the throne?

3
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,210
Quiet!

4
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:33,590
How dare you accuse the court leader without any proof?

5
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,260
Can you bet your life that I colluded with Yeongae Somun?

6
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:44,700
My return to Seorabeol was classified information that only the court leaders knew about.

7
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,530
If someone in court didn't collude with Yeongae Somun,

8
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:55,510
how did a Goguryeo patrol boat attack my boat like a falcon after prey?

9
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,710
If someone in court tried to sell my life to Goguryeo,

10
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,870
it is an act against a royal order.

11
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:08,940
It is a serious crime that threatens Silla-Tang relations and our national fate.

12
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:14,820
You will not be able to avoid responsibility because you are the court leader.

13
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:22,840
I swear I never colluded with Goguryeo bandits.

14
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:30,820
You will have to prove that rumors of you serving up the Three Kingdoms to the Tang emperor aren't true.

15
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:35,320
I have been honorable.

16
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,140
I have nothing to explain.

17
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,010
You can't do this.

18
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:44,890
The two pillars of the court shouldn't be hostile to each other.

19
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:50,060
Please calm down and clear up any misunderstandings.

20
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,080
I will prepare a drink.

21
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,770
Yes, do that.

22
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,610
Her Majesty will worry if she hears about this.

23
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:10,170
Whatever agreement you made with the Tang emperor won't happen as long as I am the court leader.

24
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,100
Remember that.

25
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:18,210
I will not allow anyone to destroy friendly relations with Tang

26
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:25,030
or allow any attempts to destroy the peace of the Three Kingdoms.

27
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,460
It have been a long time.

28
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,150
[Ancestral tablets of Kim Pumseok and Gotaso]

29
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:09,560
Even with time, the grief of losing a child doesn't seem to go away.

30
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:23,450
You lessened the bitter grief that pained my heart.

31
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,560
I know how you feel.

32
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,780
I am glad that I was able to keep my promise to recover Daeyaseong

33
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:40,710
and get back the remains of Gotaso and Pumseok.

34
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:48,460
I don't know how to face you.

35
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:56,590
You loved Nanseung, but he died because of me.

36
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,800
What can we do?

37
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:04,590
That was his fate.

38
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,510
He wanted you to live so you may achieve the great cause of unification.

39
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:15,210
I'm sure he doesn't have any regrets.

40
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:29,600
I will achieve peace of the Three Kingdoms, so the deaths of everyone who died for the cause don't go to waste.

41
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:43,410
Silla has official uniforms. Why are you suggesting that we wear Tang uniforms?

42
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:52,090
It is just a sign of trust to show that we uphold friendly relations with Tang.

43
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,950
We have to accept their leading political systems

44
00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:01,490
and reform the court to achieve prosperity for Silla and unify the Three Kingdoms.

45
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:11,610
Is it your intention to degrade Silla officials to Tang puppets and step all over the pride of Silla?

46
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,640
Or is it the Tang emperor's intention?

47
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,750
Are you that unconfident?

48
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,300
What?

49
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:25,670
Is a little speck of dust going to affect a mountain?

50
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:33,050
Even if we accept all of Tang's policies, it won't damage Silla's unique roots and pride.

51
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:38,540
Tang envies our superior paper-making skills.

52
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,750
But the skills originally came from the Central Plain.

53
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:47,600
If we didn't accept the skills because they weren't ours,

54
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,820
we would still be writing on wooden boards.

55
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,070
Paper-making skills can't compare to political policies.

56
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,770
Politics are the same.

57
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:08,980
If Silla accepts the leading policies of Tang and the people praise the royal family and court,

58
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:17,640
one day, Tang and the other countries will come to Seorabeol to learn about the politics of Silla.

59
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,980
He is right.

60
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:32,590
Discuss the matter in court and implement it.

61
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:59,910
There is a rumor Chunchu is going to abolish the meeting of the Jingol leaders.

62
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,260
What?

63
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,890
Her Majesty doesn't have an heir.

64
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,810
Isn't it clear that a Jingol will inherit the throne?

65
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:11,180
If Chunchu and Kim Yusin abolish the meeting of the Jingol leaders

66
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:16,180
and neutralize the power of the Jingol leaders,

67
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,720
the throne will go to Chunchu.

68
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,210
Quiet!

69
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:29,110
Wasn't it enough to play us by telling Yeongae Somun when Kim Chunchu would return?

70
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:35,470
Are you trying to cause trouble in court?

71
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:39,790
How did you...

72
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:46,590
Do you have to lose your head to repent for what you did?

73
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:53,660
You didn't expose Yeongae Somun's secret letter and let the Goguryeo spy go.

74
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,410
We are on the same boat.

75
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:11,550
If you do not watch that tongue of yours, you will not live long.

76
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,290
Remember that.

77
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,330
Sangdaedeung...

78
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,940
Did you deliver the Goguryeo mangniji's secret letter to the Silla court?

79
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,700
Yes.

80
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:52,090
Who told the mangniji when Chunchu would return to Silla?

81
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:58,230
Did you bring the reward you promised?

82
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,180
Oh, right.

83
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,490
Here.

84
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:13,040
You could live a life of prosperity with this.

85
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,330
Tell me.

86
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,720
Who was it?

87
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:41,990
Sajin!

88
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:49,920
Were you investigating me?

89
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,250
You should be repenting for participating in Bidam's rebellion.

90
00:09:55,250 --> 00:10:00,000
Why did you collude with the Goguryeo mangniji to kill Chunchu?

91
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,640
The sangdaedeung let it go.

92
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,100
Why are you digging into this?

93
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,020
What?

94
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:11,910
Is he involved, too?

95
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,240
I was the pungwolju at one time.

96
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,460
I will kill you all.

97
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:09,640
Sajin!

98
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:20,740
- Say hello to the mangniji.
- Of course.

99
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,320
Yeomjang's ancestral tablet

100
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:58,910
Yeomjang was killed because he was looking for the official who colluded with Goguryeo.

101
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:03,690
I swear on the Hwarang name.

102
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:10,350
I will find out who killed Yeomjang and get revenge for him.

103
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:20,880
The Silla court officials are wearing Tang uniforms

104
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,010
and imitating the Tang court?

105
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:32,090
How funny it is to watch Silla try to gain Tang's favor.

106
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:39,220
It is certain Kim Chunchu reached a secret military alliance with the Tang emperor.

107
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,380
We need to strengthen relations with the Wae court.

108
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:49,620
We should also train soldiers to be prepared for any attacks.

109
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,490
The Tang army was defeated by Goguryeo.

110
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:56,020
Why should we fear them?

111
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:03,460
Gyebaek could easily defend against a Tang army of a million by himself.

112
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,220
Right, Gyebaek?

113
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:14,310
If you order so, I will drive out the Tang army with my bare hands.

114
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:21,620
You are indeed Baekje's greatest general.

115
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:30,370
May I say something?

116
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,000
Go ahead.

117
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,490
The prosperity of Baekje depends on trading with the Central Plain.

118
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:40,980
The Central Plain is like our lifeline.

119
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,980
Instead of using our military power to take over Silla border areas,

120
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:49,720
Baekje should also seek friendly relations with Tang like Silla did.

121
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,850
For that to happen, friendly relations with Silla...

122
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,690
Crown prince!

123
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:59,020
Close that mouth of yours.

124
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:08,620
Baekje's prosperity will be achieved when we recover all the fortresses Silla took from us.

125
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:16,270
If you ever mention friendly relations with Silla or Tang again,

126
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:21,390
your loyalty will be doubted.

127
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,140
Your Majesty.

128
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,410
Your Majesty, the emperor of Tang passed away.

129
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:34,860
What? He did?

130
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:46,150
In April, 649, Li Shimin, the emperor of Tang, died at the age of fifty-two.

131
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,240
He was the second son of Li Yuan.

132
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:58,270
He rose to emperor by killing his brothers.

133
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:04,700
He was considered as one of the greatest emperors in Chinese history.

134
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:12,130
He conquered the Tujue and battled against Goguryeo.

135
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:18,550
In 645, he was defeated in the battle at Ansiseong.

136
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:26,000
A few years later, he gives an order to stop battle against Goguryeo over Liaodong and passes away.

137
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,880
Emperor Taizong united the Central Plain and built a great empire.

138
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:40,080
His death predicted political changes for Silla, Baekje, Goguryeo and the eastern Asian area of that time.

139
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:51,830
You want to send a song of praise to the new emperor of Tang?

140
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,480
Yes.

141
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,140
If we can't win him over now,

142
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:01,580
Goguryeo and Baekje could act and ruin our friendly relations with Tang.

143
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:06,910
Tang might be a huge nation that conquered the Central Plain,

144
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:11,340
but it is only 30 years old and it lost to Goguryeo before.

145
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:14,480
Isn't our praise a bit excessive?

146
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,750
It is full of flowery language.

147
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,340
It it like a servant praising his ruler.

148
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:31,090
If Her Majesty approved of this, the court will not oppose it.

149
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:36,530
But if this results in the loss of Silla's national authority,

150
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:40,160
you will not be able to avoid responsibility.

151
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,070
Thank you for agreeing.

152
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:51,300
If it causes any problems, I will take full responsibility.

153
00:16:55,550 --> 00:17:03,500
Beopmin, go to Changan and deliver this to the Tang emperor.

154
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,950
You say it is to maintain friendly relations with Tang,

155
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,540
but I am not happy with this.

156
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:14,510
Father, send me instead.

157
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,500
I will do it.

158
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,450
Beopmin, it must be you.

159
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,900
Why?

160
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:27,450
It is about keeping a promise with the previous Tang emperor.

161
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:33,340
The sons of the fathers who made the promise must confirm trust.

162
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:41,320
But I believe this could ruin Silla's national authority and destroy the pride of a Silla person.

163
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,430
If you don't go,

164
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:52,170
I will take it as an act of abandoning the cause to unify the Three Kingdoms and I will disown you.

165
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,520
Father!

166
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,290
Yusin is here.

167
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,990
Yusin.

168
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:08,210
How can you write such praise about Tang?

169
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:12,250
I am so embarrassed. This is an insult to Silla.

170
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:17,930
We will be the laughing stock of the Three Kingdoms.

171
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:24,490
This is the only way to confirm our alliance with Tang and secure safety for Silla.

172
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,980
Alliance?

173
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,260
What alliance?

174
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:37,930
I formed a military alliance with the previous emperor of Tang.

175
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,440
What?

176
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,830
A military alliance?

177
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:48,590
If the Three Kingdoms can't achieve peace and go to battle,

178
00:18:49,800 --> 00:19:02,540
I will send 200,000 soldiers to help Silla unify the Three Kingdoms.

179
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:09,410
Even if you send soldiers to help with unification of the Three Kingdoms,

180
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:14,980
please promise you will not interfere with our politics.

181
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:27,330
I will put it in writing and send it to the queen of Silla.

182
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:35,560
I will represent the court of Silla and thank you.

183
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:51,480
Are you saying the rumors of you using the Tang army to unify the Three Kingdoms were true?

184
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:57,840
If the Three Kingdoms can't maintain peace on their own, this is the only way.

185
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:03,330
Why didn't you tell me?

186
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,480
Don't you trust me?

187
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,410
I told Her Majesty.

188
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:17,470
I had no choice because of Goguryeo and Baekje spies in court.

189
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,470
Chunchu.

190
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:31,280
Your reputation could be ruined just like that because of this.

191
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:39,490
Can you handle the humiliation of being called a loyal dog of the Tang emperor?

192
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:49,120
I am honorable to the cause that we swore to achieve.

193
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:56,410
If centuries of battle could stop and the people could be saved from suffering,

194
00:20:56,410 --> 00:21:02,470
I'm not afraid of my reputation being disgraced.

195
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:07,350
I'm sure you agree with me.

196
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:17,540
Uncle.

197
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:24,750
Convince father not to send that song of praise.

198
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:42,850
Even if everyone in Seorabeol criticizes your father, you must stand by him.

199
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,830
Uncle.

200
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:52,150
Your father has great pride as a citizen of Silla.

201
00:21:52,150 --> 00:22:03,430
If he wrote a song praising the Tang emperor, he must have a good reason.

202
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:13,250
I am sure you will fulfill your duties for your father's sake and for Silla's sake.

203
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:44,420
Why did you allow Chunchu to deliver that song of praise?

204
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:55,270
This will disgrace his reputation.

205
00:22:55,790 --> 00:23:00,200
He dug his own grave.

206
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,360
Don't you think so?

207
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:18,130
Silla even wrote a song of praise for the new Tang emperor?

208
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:26,640
If Tang and Silla join forces and attack us, how will we be able to defend ourselves?

209
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,760
Please don't worry.

210
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:40,870
Even if Tang sends a million soldiers, my loyal soldiers will stop them.

211
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:45,980
Kim Chunchu will lose trust because of this.

212
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:50,980
The Silla court will fall into the hands of Alcheon.

213
00:23:51,350 --> 00:24:00,380
He overlooked the secret letter asking the date of Kim Chunchu's return.

214
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,740
If we maintain an acquaintance,

215
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:08,380
he could play a role in an alliance.

216
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:19,240
He wrote a song of praise to please the Tang emperor?

217
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:25,920
Is that all Kim Chunchu was?

218
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:30,140
I guess I misjudged him.

219
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,600
Deliver this to the sangdaedeung of Silla.

220
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:44,000
I will make future plans with Alcheon.

221
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,410
There must be no mistake.

222
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,890
Yes, sir.

223
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:07,670
Beopmin, I achieved a military alliance with the previous Tang emperor.

224
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:10,330
The new emperor is going against his father's will.

225
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:14,730
He has great ambitions and is preparing to conquer Goguryeo.

226
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:20,670
The alliance I formed with the previous emperor could be destroyed.

227
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:28,510
The Tang emperor could attack Goguryeo and even Silla.

228
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:32,620
The Three Kingdoms could be trampled by Tang.

229
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:42,810
To prevent battle in the Three Kingdoms, you must confirm the trust between Silla and Tang.

230
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,450
Tang palace

231
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:54,010
Such praise from the queen of Silla.

232
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,720
I am happy.

233
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:05,030
I will believe you confirm the alliance the former emperor formed.

234
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:10,470
I watched the former emperor form an alliance with your father.

235
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:18,540
How can I be a disloyal son and go against that?

236
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,670
Thank you.

237
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:26,910
I heard Silla uses an independent era name.

238
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:34,130
If Silla has true loyalty for Tang, it should use Tang's era name.

239
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:42,630
I will abide by the alliance if Silla does that.

240
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:58,230
Anyone who disobeys the emperor will be punished.

241
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:07,480
This song of praise is the lament of the Silla people for Silla's fallen fate.

242
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,870
The Tang emperor told Silla to use Tang's era name.

243
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:16,810
Silla is practically Tang's colony now.

244
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:23,840
The queen of Silla and Kim Chunchu must be desperate to become servants of the Tang emperor.

245
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,710
They made a mistake.

246
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:31,250
Even if I had to give up all the fortresses in the border area,

247
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,500
I wouldn't have written a song of praise.

248
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:41,750
Fortresses can be recovered, but national authority status can't.

249
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,820
Isn't that right?

250
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:51,200
How is it being a loyal dog to protect the country with the help of a powerful nation?

251
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,560
If we go to battle with Silla, the Tang emperor will not watch idly.

252
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:02,740
I believe Kim Chunchu's policy is the correct one.

253
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,460
Be quiet!

254
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:10,260
Your Majesty, please consider my opinion.

255
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:20,660
How dare you praise Kim Chunchu in front of me?

256
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,830
You know how much I hate him.

257
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:26,480
How can you say that?

258
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:41,420
He meant it out of true loyalty.

259
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,100
Please be generous.

260
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:50,170
Do you think he is right, too?

261
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:54,980
Your Majesty, I don't know about politics.

262
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:58,300
But if you and the crown prince are hostile to each other,

263
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:02,890
the royal family's authority will be lost and the court will be divided.

264
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:08,560
I do not want trouble for the royal family and court.

265
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:17,860
Go and self-reflect.

266
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:22,320
You will be punished for resisting my order.

267
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,830
Gyebaek, I will not see you for a while.

268
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:30,910
Go to the border area and wait for my order.

269
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:45,670
The emperor of Tang sent a reply confirming friendly relations with Silla.

270
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:49,800
You followed in your father's footsteps

271
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:57,800
and went all the way to Changan to maintain friendly relations between Silla and Tang.

272
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,820
Your Majesty.

273
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:05,780
The Tang emperor wants Silla to use Tang's era name.

274
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,210
Tang's era name?

275
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:16,860
Chunchu, the court will be strongly opposed to that.

276
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:21,470
It was to be foreseen since the song of praise was written.

277
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:26,800
I will handle the court. Please don't worry.

278
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:36,540
You want to use Tang's era name?

279
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:41,280
Wasn't it enough to write him a song of praise?

280
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:45,110
Do you want to give him everything?

281
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:48,230
Do you have to see Her Majesty

282
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:53,250
and all the officials swear loyalty to the Tang emperor to be satisfied?

283
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:57,300
I will accept any reprimand.

284
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:04,990
But if we don't agree to this demand, the Tang court will abandon its trust for Silla.

285
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:08,530
We even wore Tang uniforms to maintain friendly relations.

286
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:14,680
We endured all that humiliation, but all that will go to waste.

287
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,550
I don't care if Her Majesty agrees and orders the era name to be changed.

288
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:24,250
The court will not abide by that decision.

289
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:39,210
I am begging you.

290
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:44,380
Please unite the court into accepting this decision.

291
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,810
Father, why...

292
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:54,450
Get up.

293
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:05,430
I am sure you and the court will understand my intention.

294
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:22,130
The Seorabeol palace is full of Tang uniforms and praise for the Tang emperor.

295
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:26,640
Is this the Silla court or the Tang emperor's palace?

296
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,330
You are officials of Silla.

297
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:32,520
Why don't you impeach Kim Chunchu

298
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:37,190
for trying to leave the fate of this nation to the emperor of Tang?

299
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:43,030
Please calm down.

300
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:45,490
We are discussing an important national matter.

301
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:51,340
Silla's era name was given by king Beopheung.

302
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,450
It is the pride of Silla!

303
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:57,260
Is it your loyalty to promote national interest by selling our national status?

304
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:02,820
How can we fight for our country without pride for the country?

305
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:10,550
Me and my soldiers will not wear Tang armor and fight for the Tang emperor.

306
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:16,200
Even if we wear Tang uniforms and use Tang's era name,

307
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,660
as long as we don't forget our cause,

308
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:23,300
the authority of the royal family of Silla will not be lost.

309
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:28,860
Don't you know that giving our lives for the prosperity of Silla

310
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:33,170
and the unification of the Three Kingdoms makes us proud and loyal servants of Silla?

311
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:35,080
Chunchu!

312
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:40,660
You had great pride as a Silla citizen.

313
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:44,920
How can you change like this?

314
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,840
My heart is ripped to pieces.

315
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,860
Yusin

316
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,420
As long as Silla uses Tang's era name

317
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:57,160
and the court officials act as the Tang emperor's puppets,

318
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:01,700
I will not set foot in Seorabeol again.

319
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,310
Yusin.

320
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,640
Yusin!

321
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,880
Yusin!

322
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:24,290
Even if the whole world called me a loyal dog of the Tang emperor,

323
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:27,700
I believed you would be on my side.

324
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,570
Was I wrong?

325
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:35,240
You won't be able to convince me no matter what you say.

326
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,510
Yusin!

327
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:44,960
Return to being the Kim Chunchu who swore to unify the Three Kingdoms at King Jinheung's monument.

328
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,910
I will not see you until then.

329
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:17,560
Do you also see me as a traitor who sold our national status?

330
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,400
You had a lot to drink.

331
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,880
It is late. You should go to bed.

332
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:28,860
Honey.

333
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,710
If the Tang emperor sends 200,000 soldiers,

334
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:41,060
200,000 Silla citizens don't have to shed blood in battle.

335
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:47,900
I will endure any humiliation to save those people.

336
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:54,690
But I don't know how much longer I can endure

337
00:35:54,690 --> 00:36:01,770
because Yusin doesn't understand.

338
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:11,170
He might have turned his back now, but he will understand in time.

339
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:19,240
He will return and the two of you will achieve your great cause.

340
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,690
Silla-Baekje border area

341
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:04,790
Chunchu, why did you betray our cause to unify the Three Kingdoms?

342
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:31,050
You could drink all the water in the valley,

343
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:34,410
but it won't quench your thirst rage.

344
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:39,360
What brings you here?

345
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:46,570
I was frustrated, too.

346
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:51,270
I thought we could have a drink.

347
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,860
The Seorabeol court is full of pro-Tang factions.

348
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:13,460
In Sabiseong, the crown prince was dethroned for suggesting friendly relations with Tang.

349
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:17,860
The world is full of surprises.

350
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:22,740
Which side are you?

351
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,610
For or against Tang?

352
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:30,960
Does it matter?

353
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:35,540
I am only a servant of Baekje.

354
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,940
I am on the side of the Baekje people.

355
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:47,500
Anyone who challenges the royal family of Baekje or persecutes the Baekje people

356
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,910
is an enemy I have to kill.

357
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,670
That is my cause.

358
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:04,090
You are a true general.

359
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:07,650
Do you feel different?

360
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:15,300
I have a lifetime friend who swore to a great cause.

361
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:23,770
Chunchu and I seem to have chosen different paths to achieve the cause.

362
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,840
I am upset about that.

363
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:32,320
We are generals who use military tactics.

364
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,470
Chunchu isn't like that.

365
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:42,030
For us, it is important to defeat the enemy and achieve victory.

366
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:49,720
The mind of a politician like Chunchu changes innumerably.

367
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,230
How can we know what he is thinking?

368
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:59,740
Let's stop talking about politics.

369
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:08,030
Let's talk about military tactics and drink all night.

370
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:15,430
It is nice to speak frankly like this.

371
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:18,780
I feel better.

372
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:23,360
Let's drink until we drop.

373
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:28,940
Let's drink.

374
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:34,400
Let me give you another drink.

375
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:41,560
654 AD, 8th year of Queen Jindeok's reign

376
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:56,130
My mind isn't very clear.

377
00:40:56,130 --> 00:41:03,360
I'm sure you know I can't take care of national matters in this situation.

378
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:14,800
I think I will be going to see the former king's soon.

379
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:20,660
Your Majesty, don't say that.

380
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:26,330
Take care of your health and be strong.

381
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:31,580
I know my illness.

382
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,940
The throne can't be left empty.

383
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:45,770
I plan to appoint a regent to take over national matters.

384
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:49,600
What do you think?

385
00:41:51,750 --> 00:42:03,930
If you appoint a regent now, you will be deciding the successor to the throne.

386
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:09,390
Can we believe that is your intention?

387
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,900
Yes.

388
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:21,130
I plan to appoint Chunchu as regent and succeed the throne to him.

389
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:31,050
Your Majesty, how could I dare to be the regent?

390
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:33,920
Please reconsider.

391
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:43,560
It is what the former queen wanted and it is also what I want.

392
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,780
Your Majesty.

393
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:58,290
Alcheon, unite the court to accept my decision.

394
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:10,920
How can Her Majesty appoint Chunchu as regent when you are the sangdaedeung?

395
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:16,450
If Chunchu becomes the regent, Silla will become Tang's colony.

396
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:20,210
Her Majesty is so resolved. What can we do?

397
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:24,170
We have to stop her even if it means the entire court has to resign.

398
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:25,660
Isn't that so?

399
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:27,720
- Yes!
- Right!

400
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,570
That's right.

401
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,820
Do you plan to resist Her Majesty's will and be disloyal?

402
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,700
This isn't disloyalty.

403
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:43,150
As always, a regent should be appointed through a meeting of the Jingol leaders.

404
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:49,260
Sangdaedeung, call a meeting of the Jingol leaders.

405
00:43:54,510 --> 00:44:04,490
The sangdaedeung's followers are resisting Her Majesty's will and are threatening to resign from court.

406
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:10,610
They are insisting that a regent be appointed through a Jingol leaders' meeting.

407
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:16,800
Even Geumgang wants to support the sangdaedeung to be the regent.

408
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:22,450
Former Hwarangs should unite the Jingol leaders.

409
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:29,470
The sangdaedeung is showing disloyalty by resisting Her Majesty's will.

410
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:35,490
He should be impeached to suppress the disloyalty of the court.

411
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:43,560
There has been hostility in court and the people were divided before over the matter of a regent.

412
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:46,040
That must not happen again.

413
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:49,180
What will we do?

414
00:44:55,780 --> 00:45:01,280
You want to decide on a regent through a meeting of the Jingol leaders?

415
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:11,020
If a regent is to take your place, he has to be supported by the court.

416
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:17,790
If the entire court resigns because of this, your dignified intentions will be damaged.

417
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:21,970
This country will be in discord again.

418
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:26,110
Please consider that.

419
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:39,850
If the Jingol leaders decide on a regent, will you unit the court to swear loyalty?

420
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:49,000
Who would dare to refuse the decision of the Jingol leaders' meeting that you approved of?

421
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:57,330
If anyone opposed the decision, I will kill him myself.

422
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:07,830
If this is what you truly want, I will allow the regent to be decided at the meeting of the Jingol leaders.

423
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:16,890
Did you hear?

424
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:23,350
Chunchu and Alcheon are fighting over the regent position.

425
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:31,020
You should return to Seorabeol and reconcile with Chunchu.

426
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:38,200
Whatever your feelings, the two of you swore to unify the Three Kingdoms.

427
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:44,720
If he becomes the regent, it will be easier for you to achieve the cause.

428
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:52,310
Father, why did you agree to the meeting of the Jingol leaders?

429
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:57,900
The Jingol leaders will want the sangdaedeung to be the regent.

430
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,520
I know.

431
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:04,580
But what's important isn't who becomes the regent.

432
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:10,880
It is to unite national public opinions to establish a foundation for Silla's prosperity.

433
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:13,960
That is what I want.

434
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:18,060
We don't know what the decision will be yet.

435
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:23,800
It would be really helpful if Yusin was here by your side.

436
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:30,340
You should go and ask him for help.

437
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:38,350
I will wait until he opens up his heart and returns on his own.

438
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:48,750
Father, uncle called a meeting of the former Hwarang leaders to discuss the appointment of a regent.

439
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:54,140
He must be planning to help you.

440
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:19,830
It's been so long.

441
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:25,330
I am only here to lead the meeting of the former Hwarang leaders.

442
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:28,610
We can talk later.

443
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:31,290
Sure.

444
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:36,110
As the head of the former Hwarang leaders,

445
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:46,230
I am going to order Hwarangdo that they not interfere with the appointment of a regent.

446
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:54,990
I am also going to declare that a pro-Tang faction must not become the regent.

447
00:48:54,990 --> 00:49:01,240
Anyone who goes against these orders will be expelled from Hwarangdo.

448
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:04,000
Yusin.

449
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:31,470
