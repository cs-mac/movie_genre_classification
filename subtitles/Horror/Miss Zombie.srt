1
00:00:40,035 --> 00:00:41,275
It's sent.

2
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:42,812
Yeah.

3
00:00:43,071 --> 00:00:44,106
I already sent it.

4
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,149
It'll arrive today or tomorrow.

5
00:00:49,144 --> 00:00:51,283
Sorry. Just keep it a bit.

6
00:00:53,681 --> 00:00:55,251
Yeah, just a few days.

7
00:00:56,484 --> 00:00:59,090
It's docile. No worries.

8
00:01:01,022 --> 00:01:02,433
Yeah, don't worry about it.

9
00:01:03,425 --> 00:01:05,905
You can feed it anything.
Wait, no meat!

10
00:01:09,431 --> 00:01:12,742
If there's a problem,
I sent a pistol, too.

11
00:01:18,706 --> 00:01:20,276
I'll pick it up soon.

12
00:01:21,443 --> 00:01:22,945
Sorry. Bye.

13
00:01:47,635 --> 00:01:49,740
I need you to sign here.

14
00:02:08,123 --> 00:02:09,033
Thanks.

15
00:02:10,058 --> 00:02:11,298
Thank you very much.

16
00:02:23,738 --> 00:02:24,716
Open it up.

17
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,416
All right.

18
00:02:27,642 --> 00:02:28,586
Kenichi.

19
00:03:47,422 --> 00:03:48,662
Kenichi!

20
00:03:51,526 --> 00:03:52,971
A zombie, eh?

21
00:03:54,262 --> 00:03:55,741
Don't see these much.

22
00:03:56,698 --> 00:03:59,941
I've never seen one before.

23
00:04:20,521 --> 00:04:22,159
Care instructions...

24
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,566
Feed fruit or vegetables.

25
00:04:26,527 --> 00:04:29,007
Never provide meat

26
00:04:29,197 --> 00:04:31,871
as it may turn feral.

27
00:04:33,301 --> 00:04:38,876
If there is a risk of bodily harm,
dispatch it with the pistol included.

28
00:04:51,452 --> 00:04:54,058
Well, what should we do with it?

29
00:04:55,923 --> 00:04:58,597
We can't keep it here.

30
00:05:00,995 --> 00:05:02,997
We have a storage unit in town.

31
00:05:03,331 --> 00:05:04,571
Take it there.

32
00:05:04,999 --> 00:05:09,539
It's just a few days.
My friend will pick it up soon.

33
00:05:12,073 --> 00:05:13,643
Lock it up.

34
00:05:14,475 --> 00:05:15,920
Make sure it's locked.

35
00:07:58,973 --> 00:07:59,974
Damn it.

36
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:27,072
Hey, now!

37
00:08:32,607 --> 00:08:33,711
Had enough?

38
00:08:42,783 --> 00:08:44,091
Mr. Teramoto...

39
00:08:44,452 --> 00:08:47,433
I hear you're keeping a zombie here.

40
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:53,204
You can't bring
something like that into town!

41
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,205
It's a misunderstanding.

42
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:05,579
I know it looked suspicious,
arriving like that.

43
00:09:06,274 --> 00:09:11,121
It came from a former employee.
It'll just be a few days.

44
00:09:11,212 --> 00:09:13,317
But a zombie is a zombie, right?

45
00:09:13,414 --> 00:09:15,985
But this one is almost human.

46
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,824
Well, it's a carrier,

47
00:09:18,986 --> 00:09:22,991
but its virus count is low,
so it's not fully developed.

48
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:26,435
Even so, the responsibility
is on my shoulders!

49
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,767
I know. I know.

50
00:09:27,862 --> 00:09:29,500
You're a doctor and all.

51
00:09:29,897 --> 00:09:31,774
I know you know a lot.

52
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,471
But things can go wrong.

53
00:09:34,569 --> 00:09:35,707
I know.

54
00:09:36,203 --> 00:09:37,682
If something happens...

55
00:09:37,972 --> 00:09:38,848
Here.

56
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,279
I'll take care of it with this.

57
00:09:43,644 --> 00:09:45,351
That's not safe.

58
00:09:45,446 --> 00:09:47,289
Put that thing away somewhere.

59
00:09:48,182 --> 00:09:49,388
Sorry.

60
00:09:50,351 --> 00:09:52,661
I won't hesitate to call the cops.

61
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,762
I understand.

62
00:09:54,088 --> 00:09:55,658
Sorry for the disturbance.

63
00:09:55,923 --> 00:09:57,231
Unbelievable.

64
00:09:57,491 --> 00:09:58,868
What a bother.

65
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:08,209
Isn't it going to work here?

66
00:10:12,373 --> 00:10:14,046
I had to lie.

67
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,517
You three can handle it.

68
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,218
This is too colorful.

69
00:11:19,106 --> 00:11:21,746
From the missus.
Change into them.

70
00:11:31,352 --> 00:11:32,695
Have you heard?

71
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,996
Heard what?

72
00:11:34,689 --> 00:11:38,330
Well, why would a zombie
be delivered here?

73
00:11:38,893 --> 00:11:41,737
It's from Sasaki, a friend of the doc.

74
00:11:42,396 --> 00:11:44,467
He's a shady character.

75
00:11:48,135 --> 00:11:49,773
He was saying something

76
00:11:50,738 --> 00:11:53,810
about making zombies
into a new business.

77
00:11:54,642 --> 00:11:56,622
What kind of business?

78
00:11:56,711 --> 00:11:58,691
He's making them pets.

79
00:11:58,813 --> 00:12:00,190
That's dangerous.

80
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:02,227
Zombies have levels.

81
00:12:04,018 --> 00:12:08,330
The lower the level,
the more human they are.

82
00:12:10,524 --> 00:12:13,733
Oh, so ours is a low-level one.

83
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,737
Yeah, and so are you.

84
00:12:19,834 --> 00:12:23,247
Don't compare me to a zombie, man.

85
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:03,484
Okay, start scrubbing here.

86
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,277
<i>Care Instructions</i>

87
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,346
Hey.

88
00:15:14,942 --> 00:15:16,012
Listen.

89
00:15:17,344 --> 00:15:18,880
You need to use water.

90
00:15:20,748 --> 00:15:21,886
Water.

91
00:15:22,349 --> 00:15:23,419
Understand?

92
00:15:26,854 --> 00:15:29,027
Here, I'll show you.

93
00:15:29,823 --> 00:15:31,496
Like this. Here.

94
00:15:33,527 --> 00:15:34,437
Well?

95
00:15:35,095 --> 00:15:36,096
Got that?

96
00:15:46,874 --> 00:15:47,818
Sorry.

97
00:16:07,761 --> 00:16:10,935
Since Rudolf guided the way

98
00:16:11,031 --> 00:16:17,073
Santa Claus was able to deliver
presents to all the children.

99
00:16:17,171 --> 00:16:18,548
The end.

100

More!

101
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,992
Hey, just give it something rotten.

102
00:18:13,087 --> 00:18:14,464
Whatever's spoiled.

103
00:18:14,721 --> 00:18:15,563
All right.

104
00:18:22,296 --> 00:18:23,297
Oh, yeah.

105
00:18:24,164 --> 00:18:25,507
Don't give it meat.

106
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,576

What? It's sexy, right?

119
00:27:32,445 --> 00:27:33,981
It's a zombie.

120
00:27:34,948 --> 00:27:37,656
You said it's mostly human.

121
00:27:38,385 --> 00:27:39,261
Well...

122
00:27:40,453 --> 00:27:42,160
That's true, but...

123
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:58,608
Good work.

00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:05,484

No.

167
00:53:44,249 --> 00:53:47,162
I think he's just in shock.

168
00:53:47,285 --> 00:53:49,891
It's a kind of allergic reaction.
