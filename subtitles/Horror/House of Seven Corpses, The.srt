00:00:38,088 --> 00:01:17,817
(Episode 49)

2
00:00:39,728 --> 00:00:41,259
What is it?

3
00:00:42,029 --> 00:00:44,499
You think with Lee Seokjin and some old

4
00:00:44,499 --> 00:00:46,548
directors, you can turn the tables?

5
00:00:46,999 --> 00:00:48,939
It's not that simple in the real world.

6
00:00:51,389 --> 00:00:53,579
Is that your way of doing things?

7
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:57,539
Betraying a friend that trusts you,

8
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,059
and stealing all of his money?

9
00:01:00,768 --> 00:01:03,748
Sangjun asked for this, do you know?

10
00:01:03,749 --> 00:01:05,539
Is that why you wanted my father to die?

11
00:01:05,539 --> 00:01:08,388
I said he was already dead when I got there!

12
00:01:11,668 --> 00:01:12,988
Sure.

13
00:01:15,088 --> 00:01:18,228
Wherever you go and whomever you meet,

14
00:01:18,228 --> 00:01:20,028
keep telling that story.

15
00:01:20,978 --> 00:01:23,009
Even if

16
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:26,319
you made my father die,

17
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,448
don't ever speak of it.

18
00:01:28,448 --> 00:01:30,069
Ever.

19
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:34,129
If not,

20
00:01:34,808 --> 00:01:37,588
I would have to feel sorry for my father

21
00:01:37,588 --> 00:01:40,069
for being too foolish

22
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:41,478
to have trusted you so much.

23
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:49,069
It was for you.

24
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:53,088
For you,

25
00:01:54,728 --> 00:01:57,259
for an ingrate like you,

26
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:01,659
my father did all the work.

27
00:02:07,388 --> 00:02:10,538
From the beginning, my father prepared

28
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:14,108
all the money and paperwork for you.

29
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:18,878
Even if you hadn't stolen the money,

30
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:22,258
if you just let things run its course,

31
00:02:22,258 --> 00:02:24,768
you would've eventually gotten all of it.

32
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:32,529
I understand that you're an engineer,

33
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:34,549
but what about running the company?

34
00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:37,188
Asking me to manage the money is...

35
00:02:37,188 --> 00:02:40,468
If you do it, it'll be like I'm doing it.

36
00:02:40,468 --> 00:02:41,728
Sangjun, still...

37
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:43,539
On top of that,

38
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:46,468
I don't know if I need to run the company.

39
00:02:46,468 --> 00:02:47,618
I want to hire someone capable,

40
00:02:47,618 --> 00:02:49,158
and have him run it the way he wants.

41
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:50,918
I can focus on technology development,

42
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:53,829
and he can help grow the company.

43
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:03,889
(President Kim Sangjun)

44
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:05,179
Sangjun.

45
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:07,169
Sangjun!

46
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:08,449
Hey, Sangjun!

47
00:03:36,058 --> 00:03:38,188
(Taehu Industry Stock Certificate, $2.5 Million)

48
00:04:15,658 --> 00:04:19,848
Talk about lying through your teeth.

49
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:22,548
Who in the world

50
00:04:22,548 --> 00:04:24,158
gives all his money to his friend

51
00:04:24,158 --> 00:04:26,649
when he has his own family,

52
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:29,699
his own parents, and a wife?

53
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:31,968
I don't understand, either.

54
00:04:33,468 --> 00:04:36,058
If he was alive, I'd love to ask him

55
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:40,099
why he trusted someone like you.

56
00:04:41,798 --> 00:04:44,269
What kind of crazy idiot would

57
00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:47,819
trust his friend with all his money?

58
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:53,359
You think I would believe that nonsense?

59
00:04:55,149 --> 00:04:57,309
Taehu Industry's attorney Hong Mungi.

60
00:04:59,269 --> 00:05:01,439
He was one of the people you fired

61
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:03,909
when Taehu Industry filed for bankruptcy.

62
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:07,428
You can ask him.

63
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,009
(President Kim Sangjun)

64
00:06:13,168 --> 00:06:15,399
(Registration Certificate, Owner Jang Taesu)

65
00:06:19,908 --> 00:06:22,459
Taesu, what time will you be back?

66
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:25,929
Well, I think I'll finish around 5.

67
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:27,798
I'll see you then.

68
00:06:27,798 --> 00:06:30,338
I have something to tell you.

69
00:06:30,338 --> 00:06:32,079
What is it? Tell me now.

70
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:32,999
I'll tell you later.

71
00:06:32,999 --> 00:06:34,579
Don't be late.

72
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:37,658
I have a favor to ask you,

73
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:40,118
and something to give you.

74
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:20,358
Your mother's waiting.

75
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:32,108
If

76
00:07:32,108 --> 00:07:34,868
anything happens to me,

77
00:07:34,869 --> 00:07:36,629
ask Taesu for help.

78
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:41,598
Don't say such a thing.

79
00:07:42,788 --> 00:07:44,488
I'm saying, just in case.

80
00:07:59,678 --> 00:08:01,138
Hello?

81
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:14,549
Who is this, so early in the morning?

82
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:18,608
Do you remember me?

83
00:08:20,048 --> 00:08:21,308
President Jang!

84
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:23,749
- Come in. / - No, no, wait.

85
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:25,559
My coming in isn't important right now.

86
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:30,429
Did you meet Sangjun's son Kim Jiwan?

87
00:08:30,428 --> 00:08:31,998
Did you see him a few days ago?

88
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:36,369
Yes, I met Jiwan a few days ago.

89
00:08:37,198 --> 00:08:39,748
What did you two talk about?

90
00:08:40,408 --> 00:08:43,338
He asked about the financial state

91
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:46,999
of Mr. Kim when he passed away.

92
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:52,269
Is there any legal problems?

93
00:08:53,859 --> 00:08:55,259
Yes,

94
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:57,568
when Sangjun died,

95
00:08:57,568 --> 00:08:59,688
what happened to his assets?

96
00:08:59,688 --> 00:09:03,228
You know that better than I do.

97
00:09:03,229 --> 00:09:06,288
He turned everything into cash,

98
00:09:06,288 --> 00:09:08,999
and invested it into his company.

99
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:10,269
Invested it,

100
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:11,548
yes.

101
00:09:11,548 --> 00:09:12,879
Yes, that's right.

102
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:14,288
He invested all of it.

103
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:16,499
He didn't plan on giving it to me, right?

104
00:09:16,499 --> 00:09:23,678
He said he was making you the president.

105
00:09:23,678 --> 00:09:28,119
Isn't that the same thing?

106
00:09:36,119 --> 00:09:40,889
I want to give Taesu a chance.

107
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:42,438
I want to make it

108
00:09:42,438 --> 00:09:45,198
so that he can make this company grow.

109
00:09:45,198 --> 00:09:46,868
Mr. Kim,

110
00:09:46,869 --> 00:09:49,489
what about your family?

111
00:09:50,099 --> 00:09:53,929
Putting him in charge of the money is...

112
00:09:54,798 --> 00:09:57,838
This investment is for my family.

113
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,409
Excuse me?

114
00:10:01,229 --> 00:10:03,309
I'm not sure

115
00:10:03,308 --> 00:10:05,588
how much longer

116
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:07,389
my heart will last.

117
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:12,739
Without me, what will happen to my mother,

118
00:10:12,739 --> 00:10:14,249
my wife, and kids?

119
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:18,778
Anyone can talk my mother into signing

120
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:21,338
any document they want, and my wife

121
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:25,399
does not know how to deal with my mother.

122
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:29,918
I need someone to be there for my family.

123
00:10:29,918 --> 00:10:33,288
Money aside, I know Taesu will

124
00:10:33,288 --> 00:10:36,088
take great care of my family.

125
00:10:37,308 --> 00:10:41,828
I know what kind of man he is.

126
00:10:50,469 --> 00:10:53,329
President Jang...

127
00:10:57,548 --> 00:10:59,718
You,

128
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:01,489
you're lying, aren't you?

129
00:11:01,489 --> 00:11:02,729
How much money did Kim Jiwan give you?

130
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:04,419
How much did it take to pay you off?

131
00:11:04,418 --> 00:11:05,928
President Jang...

132
00:11:20,528 --> 00:11:22,908
I need to see you right now.

133
00:11:22,908 --> 00:11:24,208
Come to my office.

134
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,448
I'm not interested in seeing you.

135
00:11:26,448 --> 00:11:27,778
I'm hanging up.

136
00:11:34,188 --> 00:11:35,639
Take me to Kim Jiwan's apartment.

137
00:12:06,298 --> 00:12:08,208
I just

138
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:11,618
met with Taehu Industry's company lawyer.

139
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:15,389
Then you must've heard everything.

140
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:16,818
Yes.

141
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:23,668
You mean you heard about Sangjun?

142
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:27,769
Your family's become quite crafty.

143
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:29,538
Was it money, or something else?

144
00:12:29,538 --> 00:12:32,828
How did you make him lie to me like that?

145
00:12:32,828 --> 00:12:35,269
I remember him as a man of integrity,

146
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:37,259
so how did you buy him off?

147
00:12:39,798 --> 00:12:43,649
You're well-prepared to taint my name.

148
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:46,208
Turning Sangjun into a saint

149
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,598
will make me look dirtier and pettier.

150
00:12:48,599 --> 00:12:50,039
On top of stealing money, I'd become

151
00:12:50,038 --> 00:12:54,088
a bastard who betrayed his best friend.

152
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:56,129
Is that the plan?

153
00:12:56,129 --> 00:12:58,678
Telling the world how dirty and petty I am?

154
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:01,068
That's what you're afraid of?

155
00:13:04,509 --> 00:13:06,699
I'm relieved.

156
00:13:06,698 --> 00:13:10,128
At least you know what you did was wrong.

157
00:13:14,558 --> 00:13:16,749
Why did you do it?

158
00:13:18,788 --> 00:13:21,499
You're not that type of person.

159
00:13:22,308 --> 00:13:24,738
You valued people,

160
00:13:24,739 --> 00:13:27,309
and you were very understanding.

161
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:32,359
So Sangjun, Mother, and I

162
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:35,668
trusted you with everything.

163
00:13:35,668 --> 00:13:38,379
You were upright and kindhearted.

164
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:43,849
What happened to you?

165
00:13:45,948 --> 00:13:50,358
How did you end up here like this,

166
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:54,989
doubting Sangjun's intentions, Mr. Jang?

167
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,869
Find evidence on how Kim Jiwan

168
00:14:07,869 --> 00:14:09,349
bought that lawyer off.

169
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,509
Taesu, what if...

170
00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:12,079
What if, what?

171
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:13,938
You think it might be true?

172
00:14:13,938 --> 00:14:15,858
But if it's true, I'm...

173
00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:22,579
No.

174
00:14:22,578 --> 00:14:25,738
I'm sure there's evidence of him lying.

175
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,918
What do you think Kim Jiwan offered him?

176
00:14:28,918 --> 00:14:29,728
Wait...

177
00:14:29,729 --> 00:14:31,269
Wait, this means

178
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:34,339
he can buy my people off, too.

179
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:38,489
What are you waiting for? Go find it!

180
00:14:39,499 --> 00:14:40,788
Yes, sir.

181
00:14:50,499 --> 00:14:53,199
I'm Ha Yeongho of Daehan Daily.

182
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:55,138
I'm Kim Jiwan.

183
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:56,438
Have a seat.

184
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:04,749
I heard the news from a former employee.

185
00:15:04,749 --> 00:15:07,129
You've been contacting former directors?

186
00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:08,589
How many people have you met with?

187
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:10,199
About twenty.

188
00:15:11,068 --> 00:15:12,848
And I've been preparing

189
00:15:12,849 --> 00:15:14,809
the recordings of their accounts.

190
00:15:14,808 --> 00:15:16,168
I think I can report the story right away

191
00:15:16,168 --> 00:15:18,928
if I had a copy of those recordings.

192
00:15:18,928 --> 00:15:21,278
Can you give me a copy?

193
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:22,538
Of course.

194
00:15:22,538 --> 00:15:24,879
I'll call you once I'm done sorting them.

195
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:29,689
Can't fall asleep?

196
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,708
I can't seem to understand Father.

197
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:39,668
Why did he try to put someone like

198
00:16:39,668 --> 00:16:42,308
Jang Taesu in charge of his money?

199
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:45,349
That was so foolish.

200
00:16:45,349 --> 00:16:46,729
Jiwan.

201
00:16:48,869 --> 00:16:51,509
Don't blame your father.

202
00:16:52,068 --> 00:16:55,538
Back then, the only person he could trust

203
00:16:55,538 --> 00:16:58,078
was Mr. Jang Taesu.

204
00:16:59,229 --> 00:17:02,509
With his health deteriorating,

205
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:06,098
your father was afraid of the future.

206
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,489
And he thought

207
00:17:09,489 --> 00:17:14,058
Mr. Jang Taesu could look after us.

208
00:17:14,058 --> 00:17:16,229
He was wrong.

209
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:19,068
He trusted the man

210
00:17:19,068 --> 00:17:21,709
who stole all his money the day he died.

211
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:24,568
If it were me,

212
00:17:24,568 --> 00:17:26,318
I would've trusted Mr. Jang Taesu, too.

213
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:30,589
He was a different man

214
00:17:30,588 --> 00:17:32,798
from who he is now.

215
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:34,848
And that's why I can't forgive him.

216
00:17:34,848 --> 00:17:36,928
As a human being,

217
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:38,069
you cannot betray someone

218
00:17:38,068 --> 00:17:39,888
who trusts you.

219
00:19:24,749 --> 00:19:26,519
Hyeondo.

220
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:33,179
Why not resign from your father's company?

221
00:19:37,148 --> 00:19:41,528
I'll look into another job for you.

222
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:47,139
I should go to work.

223
00:19:58,028 --> 00:20:00,278
Sugyeong came to see you?

224
00:20:00,278 --> 00:20:03,699
She really begged for your forgiveness?

225
00:20:04,808 --> 00:20:08,138
Sugyeong looked really bad.

226
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,509
I think she's miserable.

227
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:13,058
She should be.

228
00:20:13,058 --> 00:20:14,509
Of course.

229
00:20:14,509 --> 00:20:17,618
If she's not, she's not human.

230
00:20:18,308 --> 00:20:21,939
Wait, but why do you sound so sad?

231
00:20:21,939 --> 00:20:23,509
What?

232
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:27,639
Seeing her miserable made you soft?

233
00:20:27,638 --> 00:20:29,988
Oh, my.

234
00:20:29,989 --> 00:20:32,239
You sure are a saint.

235
00:20:32,888 --> 00:20:34,738
She's going through a rough time after

236
00:20:34,739 --> 00:20:37,999
a life of luxury, and you feel sorry?

237
00:20:37,999 --> 00:20:41,259
You're the one I feel sorry for.

238
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:47,838
It seems as though Hyeondo is sick.

239
00:20:47,838 --> 00:20:49,638
He's at the hospital.

240
00:20:49,638 --> 00:20:51,658
Hyeondo?

241
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:53,278
How could a child be healthy

242
00:20:53,278 --> 00:20:55,608
when his parents have no morals?

243
00:20:55,608 --> 00:20:59,378
Karma passes down to children.

244
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:05,879
Thank you for helping me in Russia.

245
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:08,009
How could I say no to you?

246
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:10,318
I had to do it.

247
00:21:10,318 --> 00:21:11,709
So I was thinking,

248
00:21:11,709 --> 00:21:13,639
I heard you might end up

249
00:21:13,638 --> 00:21:16,448
taking over the company.

250
00:21:16,449 --> 00:21:18,719
There's an idea

251
00:21:18,719 --> 00:21:22,239
I've been developing for five years,

252
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:25,058
and going to Russia gave me

253
00:21:25,058 --> 00:21:27,128
reaffirmation on my idea.

254
00:21:27,128 --> 00:21:29,548
So I was wondering

255
00:21:29,548 --> 00:21:32,798
if you could give me a chance

256
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:35,249
to present that idea to you.

257
00:21:39,128 --> 00:21:40,828
Please don't joke around with me.

258
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:42,979
I'm not...

259
00:21:42,979 --> 00:21:46,659
Yes, I know I was hard on you,

260
00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:48,739
and made your life difficult.

261
00:21:48,739 --> 00:21:52,679
I saw talent when I saw you, so,

262
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:54,709
yes, like in Chinese novels,

263
00:21:54,709 --> 00:21:56,259
in order to make someone a hero,

264
00:21:56,259 --> 00:21:58,338
people around him

265
00:21:58,338 --> 00:22:01,128
create hardships for him.

266
00:22:01,128 --> 00:22:03,078
All Chinese heroes are like that.

267
00:22:03,078 --> 00:22:05,209
They prevail over and over again,

268
00:22:05,209 --> 00:22:06,199
and accomplish...

269
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,798
It's okay.

270
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:08,729
No, I...

271
00:22:08,729 --> 00:22:10,769
I said it's okay!

272
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:12,749
Why do you keep bugging me!

273
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:14,249
I said it's okay!

274
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,788
Something great.

275
00:22:18,138 --> 00:22:19,468
I think you're mistaken.

276
00:22:19,469 --> 00:22:20,929
It's okay.

277
00:22:20,929 --> 00:22:23,288
Sorry for cutting you off, but you're...

278
00:22:23,858 --> 00:22:25,249
No, I'm not mistaken.

279
00:22:25,249 --> 00:22:27,209
I think you're mistaken.

280
00:22:27,209 --> 00:22:30,078
It's not like that. Just think about it.

281
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:33,388
When you asked me for a favor like that,

282
00:22:33,388 --> 00:22:37,158
wasn't it because we are close?

283
00:22:38,199 --> 00:22:39,829
- Yes. / - Right?

284
00:22:39,828 --> 00:22:45,388
So since we share a special relationship,

285
00:22:45,388 --> 00:22:46,358
let me present it in a special...

286
00:22:46,358 --> 00:22:47,468
Jiwan.

287
00:22:47,878 --> 00:22:48,948
Hi, Eunsu.

288
00:22:48,949 --> 00:22:50,278
Ms. Han Eunsu!

289
00:22:50,278 --> 00:22:52,378
Oh? Hello.

290
00:22:52,378 --> 00:22:53,868
What are you doing here?

291
00:22:56,098 --> 00:22:57,668
Huh?

292
00:22:59,739 --> 00:23:01,759
She's my little sister.

293
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:04,278
Your real sister?

294
00:23:04,278 --> 00:23:05,398
Yes.

295
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:10,349
But her last name's Han, and yours is Kim.

296
00:23:11,989 --> 00:23:13,538
Jiwan, Eunsu.

297
00:23:13,538 --> 00:23:15,429
- Hi, Aunt. / - Hi.

298
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,028
Remember?

299
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:19,719
This is Mr. Yun, my former team leader.

300
00:23:19,719 --> 00:23:21,109
- Hello. / - She's my aunt.

301
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,068
Oh, Aunt.

302
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:25,608
Hello, I am Yun Oyong.

303
00:23:27,128 --> 00:23:28,178
Hi.

304
00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:31,429
I'm Park Haengsuk.

305
00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:32,649
Excuse me?

306
00:23:32,648 --> 00:23:34,488
Park...

307
00:23:34,489 --> 00:23:38,269
You're his aunt, but your last name is Park?

308
00:23:39,999 --> 00:23:45,318
Kim, Han and Park.

309
00:23:45,318 --> 00:23:47,938
A family with different last names?

310
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:55,909
What happened?

311
00:23:55,909 --> 00:23:57,489
Why is that office empty?

312
00:23:57,489 --> 00:24:00,209
All the desks and chairs are gone.

313
00:24:00,209 --> 00:24:01,808
Oh, that office?

314
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:03,308
They moved out.

315
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:05,058
They moved out?

316
00:24:05,058 --> 00:24:07,239
Where did they go?

317
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:08,959
Where are my daughter and husband?

318
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:13,959
I heard they're pitching a tent at a farm.

319
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:18,308
A, a tent?

320
00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:26,288
Oh,

321
00:24:26,288 --> 00:24:29,778
I think we need to get a phone line fast.

322
00:24:29,778 --> 00:24:31,058
When is the phone guy coming?

323
00:24:31,058 --> 00:24:32,918
He'll be here at 3.

324
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:34,909
Where should the line go?

325
00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:36,419
I'll find a spot.

326
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:38,108
I'll take that, Yeongju.

327
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:47,249
You shouldn't bite off more than you can chew,

328
00:24:47,249 --> 00:24:48,879
and mingle with your own kind!

329
00:24:48,878 --> 00:24:52,078
You're suffering because of Jiwan!

330
00:24:52,078 --> 00:24:53,979
It's my fault for signing a contract

331
00:24:53,979 --> 00:24:56,548
that says the owner can evict us at any time.

332
00:24:56,548 --> 00:24:58,259
How dare you side with Jiwan!

333
00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:00,229
I'm going to get him for this!

334
00:25:01,358 --> 00:25:02,468
Honey, Mi...

335
00:25:05,828 --> 00:25:07,378
What did Mom say?

336
00:25:09,118 --> 00:25:12,019
She's going to get Jiwan.

337
00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:13,328
What?

338
00:25:14,108 --> 00:25:15,048
Seriously...

339
00:25:15,048 --> 00:25:16,378
Let's hurry up.

340
00:25:20,338 --> 00:25:21,828
Jiwan, you!

341
00:25:22,068 --> 00:25:22,938
Hello.

342
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:24,239
Just a second.

343
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:25,949
Hello.

344
00:25:26,729 --> 00:25:29,489
It's an important meeting. This way.

345
00:25:29,939 --> 00:25:32,009
Everything looks great.

346
00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:35,709
I can see, now that I'm here.

347
00:25:35,709 --> 00:25:39,339
You put up a makeshift office near the farm.

348
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:43,219
It shows your concern for quality control.

349
00:25:43,219 --> 00:25:44,509
I just need to sign here, yes?

350
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:45,909
Yes.

351
00:25:51,388 --> 00:25:52,558
Thank you.

352
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:53,528
I hope this works out great.

353
00:25:53,528 --> 00:25:54,558
Thank you.

354
00:26:00,219 --> 00:26:01,278
Goodbye.

355
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:03,558
That guy

356
00:26:03,558 --> 00:26:05,259
is great at many things.

357
00:26:05,259 --> 00:26:07,108
He's amazing.

358
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:09,528
He performs better under pressure.

359
00:26:10,909 --> 00:26:13,419
Ms. Lee, it must've been hard to find us.

360
00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:14,849
And it's such a hot day.

361
00:26:14,848 --> 00:26:17,428
Let me get you something cool to drink.

362
00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:18,749
Mr. Jang.

363
00:26:24,838 --> 00:26:26,848
This is worth $30,000.

364
00:26:31,378 --> 00:26:34,748
Dad, why did you say it was Jiwan's fault?

365
00:26:34,749 --> 00:26:36,538
Hey, cut me some slack.

366
00:26:36,538 --> 00:26:37,949
I was caught off guard.

367
00:26:37,949 --> 00:26:39,278
It slipped out.

368
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:40,568
I can't believe you.

369
00:26:40,868 --> 00:26:43,718
It's cooked. Yes, have some.

370
00:26:44,999 --> 00:26:46,118
Director, you're here.

371
00:26:46,118 --> 00:26:47,528
- Mr. Kang, you're here. / - Honey.

372
00:26:47,528 --> 00:26:48,888
Yes.

373
00:26:50,088 --> 00:26:51,378
What are you doing here?

374
00:26:51,929 --> 00:26:53,329
What do you think?

375
00:26:53,328 --> 00:26:55,148
They are working so hard on a hot day,

376
00:26:55,148 --> 00:26:56,668
so I bought them Korean pork

377
00:26:56,669 --> 00:26:59,269
to help them restore some energy.

378
00:26:59,269 --> 00:27:02,149
Domestic is always the best.

379
00:27:02,148 --> 00:27:04,538
Of course. You're a wise man.

380
00:27:06,078 --> 00:27:08,739
Honey, don't just stand there. Come and sit.

381
00:27:08,739 --> 00:27:10,348
- Come here. / - Yeongju, come and sit down.

382
00:27:10,348 --> 00:27:11,818
Yes, Yeongju, come and eat.

383
00:27:11,818 --> 00:27:12,918
Let me go get some more lettuce.

384
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:14,129
Okay.

385
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:21,558
Wait,

386
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:23,719
weren't you mad at Jiwan?

387
00:27:23,719 --> 00:27:25,068
What's going on?

388
00:27:25,068 --> 00:27:26,348
Oh, I can't believe you.

389
00:27:26,348 --> 00:27:28,408
When? People might actually believe that.

390
00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:30,509
Why would I talk badly about Jiwan?

391
00:27:30,509 --> 00:27:33,979
When I came here, Jiwan was doing great,

392
00:27:33,979 --> 00:27:36,769
so I bought him Korean pork,

393
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:38,709
to help him restore energy.

394
00:27:38,709 --> 00:27:41,169
Why are you just sitting there?

395
00:27:41,169 --> 00:27:42,949
Go and help wash the lettuce.

396
00:27:42,949 --> 00:27:44,139
Go help Jiwan.

397
00:27:44,588 --> 00:27:46,058
Okay.

398
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:51,489
I'm a great judge of character.

399
00:27:51,489 --> 00:27:55,298
Mom, just have one spoonful.

400
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,168
Say ah.

401
00:27:56,169 --> 00:27:59,149
I don't want any chicken porridge.

402
00:27:59,148 --> 00:28:02,078
It's not just chicken. It has ginseng, too.

403
00:28:02,078 --> 00:28:04,578
You need to eat warm food in the summer,

404
00:28:04,578 --> 00:28:07,249
so you can restore energy, okay?

405
00:28:07,249 --> 00:28:09,469
Just have one spoonful.

406
00:28:09,469 --> 00:28:10,599
Say ah.

407
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,449
See?

408
00:28:18,449 --> 00:28:21,339
You're upset because of what you said.

409
00:28:21,338 --> 00:28:23,759
I didn't say anything wrong.

410
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:27,118
Imagine how Seonhui and Eunsu must feel.

411
00:28:27,118 --> 00:28:30,058
You're worried about Eunsu, aren't you?

412
00:28:31,769 --> 00:28:33,439
I hope she gets over Hyeondo,

413
00:28:33,439 --> 00:28:35,889
and meets someone nice.

414
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:39,168
I'm sure she will.

415
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,429
Couples form and break up all the time.

416
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:47,628
Jiwan doesn't have a girlfriend?

417
00:28:47,628 --> 00:28:50,878
Jiwan has no time for that.

418
00:28:53,019 --> 00:28:54,229
This?

419
00:28:57,528 --> 00:28:59,028
You see,

420
00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:03,139
here are the size and unit.

421
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:08,378
Hi.

422
00:29:10,689 --> 00:29:13,899
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

423
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:16,349
Don't say that. I'm glad you're here.

424
00:29:16,348 --> 00:29:18,028
But why are you here?

425
00:29:20,469 --> 00:29:22,909
Oh, I'm stuffed.

426
00:29:22,909 --> 00:29:26,789
You must really love spicy chicken stew.

427
00:29:26,788 --> 00:29:28,269
You ate a lot of it.

428
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:29,769
Because it was delicious.

429
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,859
It's late, so take Yeongju home.

430
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:37,978
It's okay. I can go home alone.

431
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:39,329
Don't say that.

432
00:29:39,328 --> 00:29:41,608
It's late. What if you get kidnapped?

433
00:29:41,608 --> 00:29:42,708
Take her home.

434
00:29:42,709 --> 00:29:44,219
No, that's not going to happen.

435
00:29:44,219 --> 00:29:45,778
Don't say that. Just go.

436
00:29:45,778 --> 00:29:47,348
What are you two doing?

437
00:29:47,348 --> 00:29:48,749
Let's go. I'll walk you home.

438
00:29:48,749 --> 00:29:50,659
- What? / - Go home, and go to bed.

439
00:29:50,659 --> 00:29:51,939
- Let's go, Yeongju. / - Bye.

440
00:29:51,939 --> 00:29:52,899
Okay.

441
00:29:52,898 --> 00:29:54,258
- Bye. / - Goodnight.

442
00:30:06,169 --> 00:30:08,299
Are those two dating?

443
00:30:08,989 --> 00:30:11,108
They're not together yet,

444
00:30:11,108 --> 00:30:14,028
but they are testing the waters.

445
00:30:15,848 --> 00:30:18,528
It's frustrating to watch them.

446
00:30:18,528 --> 00:30:20,159
Yeongju...

447
00:30:20,888 --> 00:30:22,318
She's nice.

448
00:30:22,318 --> 00:30:23,658
She is.

449
00:30:23,659 --> 00:30:25,849
She's pretty and pleasant.

450
00:30:25,848 --> 00:30:29,098
And she's a teacher.

451
00:30:29,098 --> 00:30:30,249
Don't you think they look good together?

452
00:30:30,249 --> 00:30:31,939
Yes, they do.

453
00:30:42,388 --> 00:30:43,608
(Unique Spicy Chicken Stew)

454
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:10,489
Ms. Kang Yeongju, what's all this?

455
00:31:10,489 --> 00:31:12,348
Why are you cooking all of a sudden?

456
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,618
I'm just practicing.

457
00:31:16,028 --> 00:31:17,568
Practicing?

458
00:31:21,219 --> 00:31:23,389
Oh, I get it.

459
00:31:23,388 --> 00:31:24,418
Girl...

460
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:27,809
You have a good eye.

461
00:31:27,808 --> 00:31:28,618
What do you mean?

462
00:31:28,618 --> 00:31:30,499
Jiwan.

463
00:31:30,499 --> 00:31:32,179
Who cares about education?

464
00:31:32,179 --> 00:31:35,679
To me, money trumps everything.

465
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,679
Stop getting ahead of yourself.

466
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,038
Seonhui is a decent mother-in-law.

467
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:45,318
Eunsu is easy.

468
00:31:45,318 --> 00:31:48,749
The grandmother-in-law will become forgetful.

469
00:31:49,358 --> 00:31:53,298
Haengsuk. She's the one to watch out for.

470
00:31:53,298 --> 00:31:55,189
I'm sick of your marriage talk.

471
00:31:55,189 --> 00:31:56,548
I told you it's not like that.

472
00:31:56,548 --> 00:31:57,418
Just leave me alone.

473
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:00,309
How could I leave you alone?

474
00:32:00,308 --> 00:32:01,959
You won't go on blind dates,

475
00:32:01,959 --> 00:32:04,288
but you can't even make Jiwan yours.

476
00:32:05,338 --> 00:32:06,828
If it were me in the old days,

477
00:32:06,828 --> 00:32:08,749
I would've already...

478
00:32:09,499 --> 00:32:11,219
What's the use of giving you my looks?

479
00:32:11,219 --> 00:32:12,869
Just look at yourself.

480
00:32:12,868 --> 00:32:15,948
You're dressed like a tomboy,

481
00:32:15,949 --> 00:32:17,829
and you haven't taken a shower.

482
00:32:17,828 --> 00:32:20,778
You need to make yourself look pretty!

483
00:32:20,778 --> 00:32:23,469
Practicing cooking won't help you at all.

484
00:32:23,469 --> 00:32:25,969
If a girl is pretty, nothing else matters.

485
00:32:25,969 --> 00:32:27,439
You have to look pretty!

486
00:32:27,439 --> 00:32:29,298
What good will cooking do for you?

487
00:32:29,298 --> 00:32:30,668
Besides your pretty face,

488
00:32:30,669 --> 00:32:33,419
you got nothing from me!

489
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:35,729
What do you mean? Like this?

490
00:32:38,689 --> 00:32:39,859
Oh, you're impossible.

491
00:32:39,858 --> 00:32:42,308
You're my daughter, but you're impossible!

492
00:32:42,308 --> 00:32:45,178
Be more like Oh Minja! Like me!

493
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:48,828
Minja.

494
00:32:48,828 --> 00:32:49,749
Oh!

495
00:32:49,749 --> 00:32:50,719
Ms. Lee!

496
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:51,769
What are you doing here?

497
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:55,068
I need a new pillow for my neck pain.

498
00:32:55,068 --> 00:32:56,558
What about you?

499
00:32:57,199 --> 00:33:00,048
Yeongju's been complaining about neck pain, too.

500
00:33:01,338 --> 00:33:02,618
Well,

501
00:33:02,618 --> 00:33:06,228
is Yeongju still going on blind dates?

502
00:33:07,709 --> 00:33:09,038
I've given up on that.

503
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:10,388
How they feel about each other is important,

504
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,118
not their background.

505
00:33:12,568 --> 00:33:15,378
You're right!

506
00:33:15,378 --> 00:33:20,558
But I heard you hold education very high.

507
00:33:21,439 --> 00:33:24,729
If they're in love, education doesn't matter.

508
00:33:24,729 --> 00:33:27,769
As long as he's hard-working, it's fine.

509
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:33,628
But isn't a small family better?

510
00:33:34,459 --> 00:33:37,798
I would prefer a small family,

511
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:39,199
but these days, as complicated as it is,

512
00:33:39,199 --> 00:33:42,489
people don't live with married children.

513
00:33:42,489 --> 00:33:44,909
- You mean live separately? / - Yes.

514
00:33:46,048 --> 00:33:47,608
But that's...

515
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:49,448
Well...

516
00:33:49,449 --> 00:33:51,818
Old people don't live forever.

517
00:33:51,818 --> 00:33:54,519
And I'm dying to have a great-grandchild.

518
00:33:55,048 --> 00:33:57,568
I'm not going to let my daughter

519
00:33:57,568 --> 00:33:59,378
date anyone with a large family.

520
00:33:59,378 --> 00:34:01,788
What if she gets stuck with them?

521
00:34:01,788 --> 00:34:03,608
That won't be good.

522
00:34:05,239 --> 00:34:08,418
Yes, getting stuck is the key.

523
00:34:08,759 --> 00:34:10,528
As long as they live separately,

524
00:34:10,528 --> 00:34:13,099
you don't mind a big family?

525
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:14,649
Of course not.

526
00:34:14,648 --> 00:34:16,949
As long as they are in love.

527
00:34:17,829 --> 00:34:18,719
Why do you ask?

528
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,509
You have someone in mind?

529
00:34:22,509 --> 00:34:23,958
Of course.

530
00:34:25,778 --> 00:34:27,938
- You do? / - Yes.

531
00:34:39,108 --> 00:34:41,878
Hello, I'm Ha Yeongho from Daehan Daily.

532
00:34:41,878 --> 00:34:45,639
Someone tipped me off about Taehu Industry.

533
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:48,679
You drove Taehu Industry into bankruptcy,

534
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:51,889
and stole millions in funds. Is that true?

535
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,469
There are protocols for reporters...

536
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:55,059
Your former employee Lee Seokjin, and

537
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:57,778
former directors will be giving statements!

538
00:34:57,778 --> 00:34:59,168
Tell me if it's true,

539
00:34:59,168 --> 00:35:01,418
or if it's slander!

540
00:35:01,418 --> 00:35:04,328
President Jang!

541
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:05,449
Please leave.

542
00:35:08,759 --> 00:35:10,789
Refuse all interviews.

543
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:12,949
It wasn't Kim Jiwan.

544
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:16,278
Don't jump the gun, or get them involved.

545
00:35:16,278 --> 00:35:18,318
I'm sure the reporter heard a rumor.

546
00:35:20,188 --> 00:35:21,418
If he had all the evidence,

547
00:35:21,418 --> 00:35:23,538
he would've written about it already.

548
00:35:24,298 --> 00:35:26,788
I'm coming in, so make sure no one talks.

549
00:35:26,789 --> 00:35:30,139
I told you to find him, by any means!

550
00:35:30,139 --> 00:35:30,979
What are you doing?

551
00:35:30,978 --> 00:35:32,808
Is it that you can't or won't?

552
00:35:35,168 --> 00:35:36,888
Seokjin was

553
00:35:36,889 --> 00:35:39,628
with us from the birth of Taehu Industry,

554
00:35:39,628 --> 00:35:41,628
and is still with us today.

555
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:45,918
Dongjin still calls us to congratulate us

556
00:35:45,918 --> 00:35:48,328
whenever we reach a new milestone.

557
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:53,579
Hyeokju practically lived with us

558
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:55,259
at the factory.

559
00:35:56,378 --> 00:35:58,838
So how could I

560
00:35:58,838 --> 00:36:02,248
dig into their past, and make threats?

561
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:04,759
Taesu!

562
00:36:08,188 --> 00:36:10,719
You've been paid off, too?

563
00:36:13,179 --> 00:36:16,269
I know you met with Seokjin.

564
00:36:16,268 --> 00:36:18,448
I wasn't sure.

565
00:36:18,938 --> 00:36:20,259
So, what did you get from them?

566
00:36:20,259 --> 00:36:23,188
How much did they pay you!

567
00:36:23,818 --> 00:36:25,208
Taesu...

568
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:26,458
Get out.

569
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:27,438
You're fired!

570
00:36:27,438 --> 00:36:28,808
Get lost!

571
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:32,608
Hyeondo,

572
00:37:33,338 --> 00:37:36,068
I once told your father

573
00:37:36,068 --> 00:37:38,358
to watch his back because of you.

574
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:43,349
And he said to me,

575
00:37:45,009 --> 00:37:47,068
even if you betrayed him, that was okay.

576
00:37:48,268 --> 00:37:50,248
Because you're his son.

577
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:56,378
Look after Taesu.

578
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:01,099
I can't seem to do it anymore.

579
00:38:54,989 --> 00:38:58,338
Is this Mr. Han Yeongho of Daehan Daily?

580
00:38:58,338 --> 00:39:00,208
This is Kim Jiwan.

581
00:39:01,438 --> 00:39:04,828
Can we have that interview tomorrow?

582
00:39:11,898 --> 00:39:13,518
Yes, Mr. Han.

583
00:39:14,778 --> 00:39:16,458
I'm on my way.

584
00:40:15,139 --> 00:40:16,699
Your father was going to

585
00:40:17,909 --> 00:40:21,499
hand over his company to my father?

586
00:40:24,778 --> 00:40:27,278
I couldn't understand him at first,

587
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:32,559
but now that I think about it,

588
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:34,489
I can understand him a little bit.

589
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:50,159
This is all the evidence I've collected.

590
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:56,408
Why are you giving them to me?

591
00:41:01,548 --> 00:41:03,568
Why did you

592
00:41:03,568 --> 00:41:05,728
give me that notebook?

593
00:41:39,128 --> 00:41:40,449
Have you had a lot to drink?

594
00:41:41,778 --> 00:41:45,298
You asked me here, so why are you late?

595
00:41:49,918 --> 00:41:51,848
I met Jiwan.

596
00:41:55,278 --> 00:41:57,559
Uncle Sangjun

597
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:02,548
was going to give you all his money?

598
00:42:03,298 --> 00:42:05,208
That's a lie.

599
00:42:05,978 --> 00:42:07,898
Right?

600
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:14,219
Who would actually do that?

601
00:42:14,219 --> 00:42:16,548
Why would he give you his company

602
00:42:16,548 --> 00:42:19,168
when he has a son and a family?

603
00:42:19,168 --> 00:42:21,088
That's ridiculous.

604
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:23,568
You were just a friend.

605
00:42:24,688 --> 00:42:26,478
Not his blood.

606
00:42:30,509 --> 00:42:32,418
Don't you agree?

607
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:35,639
Yes.

608
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:38,219
I'm not his blood.

609
00:42:41,108 --> 00:42:43,418
But,

610
00:42:44,248 --> 00:42:46,998
even though I wasn't his blood,

611
00:42:46,998 --> 00:42:50,638
Sangjun might have actually really

612
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:54,789
wanted to give me his company.

613
00:42:57,778 --> 00:43:01,349
But why...

614
00:43:01,349 --> 00:43:03,869
How could he trust me so much?

615
00:43:41,338 --> 00:43:42,578
Jiwan.

616
00:43:45,978 --> 00:43:49,318
Do you

617
00:43:49,318 --> 00:43:52,199
remember Dad?

618
00:43:55,228 --> 00:43:57,088
A little bit.

619
00:44:00,199 --> 00:44:05,938
What kind of person was he?

620
00:44:08,818 --> 00:44:12,009
He smiled at me whenever he saw me.

621
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:22,119
Why did

622
00:44:23,989 --> 00:44:28,298
Dad trust a man like him?

623
00:44:30,489 --> 00:44:33,088
He was so foolish.

624
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:40,539
You think so, too, don't you?

625
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:52,659
How have you been?

626
00:46:05,539 --> 00:46:07,609
Don't turn bad.

627
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,749
That's not who you are, Hyeondo.

628
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:25,289
I should go.

629
00:47:05,298 --> 00:47:06,538
The Korean Businessmen's Association

630
00:47:06,539 --> 00:47:10,359
recommended you as a next chairperson.

631
00:47:10,818 --> 00:47:14,748
You're to give an acceptance speech.

632
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:17,438
Okay.

633
00:47:17,438 --> 00:47:18,918
I got it.

634
00:47:19,498 --> 00:47:20,948
Oh, and

635
00:47:20,949 --> 00:47:23,048
call my wife's lawyer,

636
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:25,068
and have him visit me here.

637
00:47:25,068 --> 00:47:26,509
Yes, sir.

638
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:36,548
President Jang wants to see you

639
00:47:36,548 --> 00:47:38,429
before going to court.

640
00:47:39,728 --> 00:47:41,358
What is it about?

641
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,949
He said he will tell you in person.

642
00:48:37,438 --> 00:48:40,638
You like the coffee here, don't you?

643
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:43,568
You didn't call me here for coffee.

644
00:48:43,568 --> 00:48:45,568
What is this about?

645
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:48,829
I called you over to have a cup of coffee.

646
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:51,298
Excuse me.

647
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:16,318
I came because you like it here,

648
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:17,938
but to me, the company

649
00:49:17,938 --> 00:49:21,088
vending machine coffee's the best.

650
00:49:22,309 --> 00:49:26,369
You've always had cheap taste.

651
00:49:26,369 --> 00:49:27,709
What?

652
00:49:27,708 --> 00:49:29,888
You hate me because of my cheap taste?

653
00:49:30,458 --> 00:49:32,838
No,

654
00:49:32,838 --> 00:49:35,068
it was easy for me.

655
00:49:37,759 --> 00:49:39,438
Successful men

656
00:49:39,438 --> 00:49:42,989
always get a mistress first.

657
00:49:42,989 --> 00:49:45,289
But

658
00:49:45,289 --> 00:49:48,349
you have simple taste in everything.

659
00:49:48,349 --> 00:49:50,499
Vending machine coffee, soju,

660
00:49:50,498 --> 00:49:52,538
and roasted rice tea after meals.

661
00:49:53,818 --> 00:49:56,409
And with women, only Jeong Sugyeong.

662
00:49:58,168 --> 00:50:01,358
I did have simple taste,

663
00:50:01,358 --> 00:50:03,958
but it was never cheap.

664
00:50:06,849 --> 00:50:11,749
I loved having you

665
00:50:11,748 --> 00:50:13,538
as my husband.

666
00:50:16,369 --> 00:50:19,709
I respected you

667
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:24,528
more than anyone.

668
00:50:29,378 --> 00:50:32,449
If you are willing to change,

669
00:50:32,449 --> 00:50:35,378
nothing will change between us.

670
00:50:43,398 --> 00:50:48,058
Will Jeong Sugyeong still love Jang Taesu

671
00:50:48,059 --> 00:50:51,329
without his money and honor?

672
00:50:55,099 --> 00:50:58,459
That's why it can't be, Ms. Jeong.

673
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:10,949
This is the divorce papers.

674
00:51:10,949 --> 00:51:12,969
I already signed it,

675
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:14,999
so you take care of the rest.

676
00:52:58,528 --> 00:53:01,748
Are you sure you want to let this go?

677
00:53:02,878 --> 00:53:05,368
You won't regret it?

678
00:53:07,188 --> 00:53:09,618
That was what Father wanted.

679
00:53:10,858 --> 00:53:13,139
If President Jang

680
00:53:13,139 --> 00:53:17,009
doesn't change his ways after finding out

681
00:53:17,909 --> 00:53:20,608
what Father wanted, he'll be more miserable.

682
00:53:40,929 --> 00:53:44,068
Hello, everyone.

683
00:53:44,068 --> 00:53:46,579
I'm Jang Taesu from Best Global,

684
00:53:46,579 --> 00:53:50,019
who recently won Businessman of the Year.

685
00:53:55,969 --> 00:53:59,869
There are many senior entrepreneurs

686
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:01,679
and colleagues who deserve the award,

687
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:03,409
so I feel a very big responsibility

688
00:54:03,409 --> 00:54:05,648
to win this accolade.

689
00:54:06,088 --> 00:54:10,759
And it's an honor to have the position

690
00:54:10,759 --> 00:54:13,759
to represent all entrepreneurs.

691
00:54:15,159 --> 00:54:18,969
Sitting here

692
00:54:18,969 --> 00:54:21,579
brings back old memories.

693
00:54:24,349 --> 00:54:29,789
I had a friend.

694
00:54:30,378 --> 00:54:34,348
He trusted me when I had nothing,

695
00:54:34,349 --> 00:54:38,929
and helped me get to where I am today.

696
00:54:39,528 --> 00:54:41,748
He was the president of Taehu Industry

697
00:54:41,748 --> 00:54:44,848
where Best Global began.

698
00:54:48,228 --> 00:54:50,628
Kim Sangjun.

699
00:54:52,568 --> 00:54:56,338
That was my friend's name.

700
00:54:56,958 --> 00:55:00,278
He was naively trusting,

701
00:55:00,278 --> 00:55:02,759
and honest

702
00:55:02,759 --> 00:55:06,429
even to a fault.

703
00:55:07,759 --> 00:55:10,498
I considered his company

704
00:55:10,498 --> 00:55:13,948
as my own,

705
00:55:15,268 --> 00:55:18,198
and worked hard.

706
00:55:26,039 --> 00:55:29,299
But,

707
00:55:29,298 --> 00:55:33,349
I

708
00:55:33,349 --> 00:55:36,469
stole...

709
00:55:49,188 --> 00:55:51,608
All of his money.

710
00:55:54,509 --> 00:55:55,978
What did he just say?

711
00:56:14,259 --> 00:56:17,998
Yeongju, summarize this register, please.

712
00:56:19,949 --> 00:56:21,568
May I help you?

713
00:56:25,429 --> 00:56:27,619
Mr. Jang Hyeondo.

714
00:56:27,619 --> 00:56:30,358
How dare you come here!

715
00:56:31,449 --> 00:56:33,179
Jang Hyeondo?

716
00:56:34,059 --> 00:56:36,159
You're that guy?

717
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:37,499
How dare you show your face here?

718
00:56:37,498 --> 00:56:39,188
Get out.

719
00:56:52,588 --> 00:56:54,778
I'm sorry.

720
00:56:56,009 --> 00:56:59,239
That's all I can say.

721
00:57:09,389 --> 00:57:10,929
Yes.

722
00:57:11,818 --> 00:57:17,369
I tricked my trusting friend's family,

723
00:57:17,369 --> 00:57:20,989
and bought their shares for pennies.

724
00:57:20,989 --> 00:57:25,369
And I even kicked his family out

725
00:57:25,369 --> 00:57:28,298
from their house.

726
00:57:32,389 --> 00:57:35,128
And so I used

727
00:57:35,128 --> 00:57:39,199
the stolen money,

728
00:57:41,159 --> 00:57:45,329
and built my own company.

I would regret it for the rest of my life.

735
01:00:10,699 --> 01:00:13,159
Sangjun

736
01:00:13,159 --> 01:00:16,048
might have died because of me.

737
01:00:17,248 --> 01:00:19,228
He's giving you what?

738
01:00:19,228 --> 01:00:20,408
Stocks.

739
01:00:20,409 --> 01:00:23,548
And he's resigning from his position.

740
01:00:24,378 --> 01:00:27,338
Why are they so dense,

741
01:00:27,338 --> 01:00:28,489
when I'm trying to help them?

742
01:00:28,489 --> 01:00:30,499
They should at least try to

743
01:00:30,498 --> 01:00:31,848
go on a few dates.

744
01:00:31,849 --> 01:00:34,019
You're going to let Father be as he is?

745
01:00:34,018 --> 01:00:37,258
Ma'am, get me a glass of ice water!

(Episode 49)

747
01:01:22,438 --> 01:01:23,969
What is it?

748
01:01:24,739 --> 01:01:27,208
You think with Lee Seokjin and some old

749
01:01:27,208 --> 01:01:29,259
directors, you can turn the tables?

750
01:01:29,708 --> 01:01:31,648
It's not that simple in the real world.

751
01:01:34,099 --> 01:01:36,289
Is that your way of doing things?

752
01:01:37,668 --> 01:01:40,248
Betraying a friend that trusts you,

753
01:01:40,248 --> 01:01:42,768
and stealing all of his money?

754
01:01:43,478 --> 01:01:46,458
Sangjun asked for this, do you know?

755
01:01:46,458 --> 01:01:48,248
Is that why you wanted my father to die?

756
01:01:48,248 --> 01:01:51,098
I said he was already dead when I got there!

757
01:01:54,378 --> 01:01:55,699
Sure.

758
01:01:57,798 --> 01:02:00,938
Wherever you go and whomever you meet,

759
01:02:00,938 --> 01:02:02,739
keep telling that story.

760
01:02:03,688 --> 01:02:05,719
Even if

761
01:02:05,719 --> 01:02:09,028
you made my father die,

762
01:02:09,028 --> 01:02:11,159
don't ever speak of it.

763
01:02:11,159 --> 01:02:12,778
Ever.

764
01:02:14,259 --> 01:02:16,838
If not,

765
01:02:17,518 --> 01:02:20,298
I would have to feel sorry for my father

766
01:02:20,298 --> 01:02:22,778
for being too foolish

767
01:02:22,778 --> 01:02:24,188
to have trusted you so much.

768
01:02:29,688 --> 01:02:31,778
It was for you.

769
01:02:33,949 --> 01:02:35,798
For you,

770
01:02:37,438 --> 01:02:39,969
for an ingrate like you,

771
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:44,369
my father did all the work.

772
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:53,249
From the beginning, my father prepared

773
01:02:53,248 --> 01:02:56,818
all the money and paperwork for you.

774
01:02:58,278 --> 01:03:01,588
Even if you hadn't stolen the money,

775
01:03:01,588 --> 01:03:04,969
if you just let things run its course,

776
01:03:04,969 --> 01:03:07,479
you would've eventually gotten all of it.

777
01:03:11,438 --> 01:03:15,239
I understand that you're an engineer,

778
01:03:15,239 --> 01:03:17,259
but what about running the company?

779
01:03:17,259 --> 01:03:19,898
Asking me to manage the money is...

780
01:03:19,898 --> 01:03:23,179
If you do it, it'll be like I'm doing it.

781
01:03:23,179 --> 01:03:24,439
Sangjun, still...

782
01:03:24,438 --> 01:03:26,248
On top of that,

783
01:03:26,248 --> 01:03:29,178
I don't know if I need to run the company.

784
01:03:29,179 --> 01:03:30,329
I want to hire someone capable,

785
01:03:30,329 --> 01:03:31,869
and have him run it the way he wants.

786
01:03:31,869 --> 01:03:33,629
I can focus on technology development,

787
01:03:33,628 --> 01:03:36,538
and he can help grow the company.

his own parents, and a wife?

798
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:14,679
I don't understand, either.

799
01:05:16,179 --> 01:05:18,769
If he was alive, I'd love to ask him

800
01:05:20,398 --> 01:05:22,808
why he trusted someone like you.

801
01:05:24,509 --> 01:05:26,978

802
01:05:26,978 --> 01:05:30,528
trust his friend with all his money?

803
01:05:32,648 --> 01:05:36,068
You think I would believe that nonsense?

Did you see him a few days ago?

Yes, I met Jiwan a few days ago.

What did you two talk about?

835

840
01:09:40,279 --> 01:09:42,399
what happened to his assets?

You know that better than I do.

842
01:09:45,939 --> 01:09:48,999
He turned everything into cash,

843
01:09:48,998 --> 01:09:51,708
and invested it into his company.

844
01:09:51,708 --> 01:09:52,979
Invested it,

Yes, that's right.

847

He invested all of it.

848
01:09:56,998 --> 01:09:59,208
He didn't plan on giving it to me, right?

849

01:10:18,828 --> 01:10:23,599
I want to give Taesu a chance.

852
01:10:23,599 --> 01:10:25,149
I want to make it

853
01:10:25,149 --> 01:10:27,909
so that he can make this company grow.

854
01:10:27,908 --> 01:10:29,578
Mr. Kim,

855
01:10:29,578 --> 01:10:32,198
what about your family?

856
01:10:32,809 --> 01:10:36,639
Putting him in charge of the money is...

857
01:10:37,509 --> 01:10:40,548
This investment is for my family.

858
01:10:40,548 --> 01:10:42,118
Excuse me?

859
01:10:43,939 --> 01:10:46,019
I'm not sure

860
01:10:46,019 --> 01:10:48,298
how much longer

861
01:10:48,298 --> 01:10:50,099
my heart will last.

862
01:10:51,469 --> 01:10:55,448
Without me, what will happen to my mother,

863
01:10:55,448 --> 01:10:56,958
my wife, and kids?

864
01:10:58,729 --> 01:11:01,489
Anyone can talk my mother into signing

865
01:11:01,488 --> 01:11:04,048
any document they want, and my wife

866
01:11:04,048 --> 01:11:08,109
does not know how to deal with my mother.

867
01:11:08,109 --> 01:11:12,629
I need someone to be there for my family.

868
01:11:12,628 --> 01:11:15,998
Money aside, I know Taesu will

869
01:11:15,998 --> 01:11:18,798
take great care of my family.

870
01:11:20,019 --> 01:11:24,539
I know what kind of man he is.

871
01:11:33,179 --> 01:11:36,038
President Jang...

872
01:11:40,259 --> 01:11:42,429
You,

873
01:11:42,429 --> 01:11:44,199
you're lying, aren't you?

874
01:11:44,198 --> 01:11:45,438
How much money did Kim Jiwan give you?

875
01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:47,128
How much did it take to pay you off?

876
01:11:47,128 --> 01:11:48,639
President Jang...

877
01:12:03,238 --> 01:12:05,618
I need to see you right now.

878
01:12:05,618 --> 01:12:06,918
Come to my office.

879
01:12:06,918 --> 01:12:09,158
I'm not interested in seeing you.

880
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:10,488
I'm hanging up.

881
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:18,349
Take me to Kim Jiwan's apartment.

882
01:12:49,009 --> 01:12:50,918
I just

883
01:12:50,918 --> 01:12:54,328
met with Taehu Industry's company lawyer.

884
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:58,099
Then you must've heard everything.

885
01:12:58,099 --> 01:12:59,529
Yes.

886
01:13:01,748 --> 01:13:06,378
You mean you heard about Sangjun?

887
01:13:07,298 --> 01:13:10,479
Your family's become quite crafty.

888
01:13:10,479 --> 01:13:12,249
Was it money, or something else?

889
01:13:12,248 --> 01:13:15,538
How did you make him lie to me like that?

890
01:13:15,538 --> 01:13:17,978
I remember him as a man of integrity,

891
01:13:17,979 --> 01:13:19,969
so how did you buy him off?

892
01:13:22,509 --> 01:13:26,359
You're well-prepared to taint my name.

893
01:13:26,359 --> 01:13:28,919
Turning Sangjun into a saint

894
01:13:28,918 --> 01:13:31,309
will make me look dirtier and pettier.

895
01:13:31,309 --> 01:13:32,748
On top of stealing money, I'd become

896
01:13:32,748 --> 01:13:36,798
a bastard who betrayed his best friend.

897
01:13:36,798 --> 01:13:38,838
Is that the plan?

898
01:13:38,838 --> 01:13:41,389
Telling the world how dirty and petty I am?

899
01:13:41,389 --> 01:13:43,779
That's what you're afraid of?

900
01:13:47,219 --> 01:13:49,408
I'm relieved.

901
01:13:49,408 --> 01:13:52,838
At least you know what you did was wrong.

902
01:13:57,269 --> 01:13:59,458
Why did you do it?

903
01:14:01,498 --> 01:14:04,208
You're not that type of person.

904
01:14:05,019 --> 01:14:07,449
You valued people,

905
01:14:07,448 --> 01:14:10,018
and you were very understanding.

906
01:14:11,559 --> 01:14:15,069
So Sangjun, Mother, and I

907
01:14:15,069 --> 01:14:18,379
trusted you with everything.

908
01:14:18,378 --> 01:14:21,088
You were upright and kindhearted.

909
01:14:24,479 --> 01:14:26,559
What happened to you?

910
01:14:28,658 --> 01:14:33,068
How did you end up here like this,

911
01:14:33,069 --> 01:14:37,699
doubting Sangjun's intentions, Mr. Jang?

912
01:14:47,889 --> 01:14:50,578
Find evidence on how Kim Jiwan

913
01:14:50,578 --> 01:14:52,058
bought that lawyer off.

914
01:14:52,059 --> 01:14:53,219
Taesu, what if...

915
01:14:53,219 --> 01:14:54,788
What if, what?

916
01:14:54,788 --> 01:14:56,648
You think it might be true?

917
01:14:56,649 --> 01:14:58,569
But if it's true, I'm...

918
01:15:03,708 --> 01:15:05,288
No.

919
01:15:05,288 --> 01:15:08,448
I'm sure there's evidence of him lying.

920
01:15:08,448 --> 01:15:11,628
What do you think Kim Jiwan offered him?

921
01:15:11,628 --> 01:15:12,439
Wait...

922
01:15:12,439 --> 01:15:13,979
Wait, this means

923
01:15:13,979 --> 01:15:17,048
he can buy my people off, too.

924
01:15:18,469 --> 01:15:21,198
What are you waiting for? Go find it!

925
01:15:22,208 --> 01:15:23,498
Yes, sir.

926
01:15:33,208 --> 01:15:35,908
I'm Ha Yeongho of Daehan Daily.

927
01:15:36,788 --> 01:15:37,849
I'm Kim Jiwan.

928
01:15:37,849 --> 01:15:39,149
Have a seat.

929
01:15:43,969 --> 01:15:47,458
I heard the news from a former employee.

930
01:15:47,458 --> 01:15:49,838
You've been contacting former directors?

931
01:15:49,838 --> 01:15:51,298
How many people have you met with?

932
01:15:51,298 --> 01:15:52,908
About twenty.

933
01:15:53,779 --> 01:15:55,559
And I've been preparing

934
01:15:55,559 --> 01:15:57,519
the recordings of their accounts.

935
01:15:57,519 --> 01:15:58,878
I think I can report the story right away

936
01:15:58,878 --> 01:16:01,639
if I had a copy of those recordings.

937
01:16:01,639 --> 01:16:03,989
Can you give me a copy?

938
01:16:03,988 --> 01:16:05,248
Of course.

939
01:16:05,248 --> 01:16:07,588
I'll call you once I'm done sorting them.

940
01:17:09,798 --> 01:17:12,399
Can't fall asleep?

941
01:17:14,918 --> 01:17:17,418
I can't seem to understand Father.

942
01:17:18,918 --> 01:17:22,378
Why did he try to put someone like

943
01:17:22,378 --> 01:17:25,019
Jang Taesu in charge of his money?

944
01:17:26,849 --> 01:17:28,059
That was so foolish.

945
01:17:28,059 --> 01:17:29,439
Jiwan.

946
01:17:31,578 --> 01:17:34,219
Don't blame your father.

947
01:17:34,779 --> 01:17:38,249
Back then, the only person he could trust

948
01:17:38,248 --> 01:17:40,788
was Mr. Jang Taesu.

949
01:17:41,939 --> 01:17:45,219
With his health deteriorating,

950
01:17:45,219 --> 01:17:48,809
your father was afraid of the future.

951
01:17:49,469 --> 01:17:52,198
And he thought

952
01:17:52,198 --> 01:17:56,768
Mr. Jang Taesu could look after us.

953
01:17:56,769 --> 01:17:58,939
He was wrong.

954
01:17:59,729 --> 01:18:01,779
He trusted the man

955
01:18:01,779 --> 01:18:04,419
who stole all his money the day he died.

956
01:18:04,418 --> 01:18:07,278
If it were me,

957
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:09,029
I would've trusted Mr. Jang Taesu, too.

958
01:18:10,408 --> 01:18:13,298
He was a different man

959
01:18:13,298 --> 01:18:15,509
from who he is now.

960
01:18:15,509 --> 01:18:17,559
And that's why I can't forgive him.

961
01:18:17,559 --> 01:18:19,639
As a human being,

962
01:18:19,639 --> 01:18:20,779
you cannot betray someone

963
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:22,599
who trusts you.

964
01:20:07,458 --> 01:20:09,229
Hyeondo.

965
01:20:11,469 --> 01:20:15,889
Why not resign from your father's company?

966
01:20:19,859 --> 01:20:24,239
I'll look into another job for you.

967
01:20:27,969 --> 01:20:29,849
I should go to work.

968
01:20:40,738 --> 01:20:42,988
Sugyeong came to see you?

969
01:20:42,988 --> 01:20:46,408
She really begged for your forgiveness?

970
01:20:47,519 --> 01:20:50,849
Sugyeong looked really bad.

971
01:20:51,958 --> 01:20:54,219
I think she's miserable.

972
01:20:54,219 --> 01:20:55,769
She should be.

973
01:20:55,769 --> 01:20:57,219
Of course.

974
01:20:57,219 --> 01:21:00,328
If she's not, she's not human.

975
01:21:01,019 --> 01:21:04,649
Wait, but why do you sound so sad?

976
01:21:04,649 --> 01:21:06,219
What?

977
01:21:06,969 --> 01:21:10,349
Seeing her miserable made you soft?

978
01:21:10,349 --> 01:21:12,699
Oh, my.

979
01:21:12,698 --> 01:21:14,948
You sure are a saint.

980
01:21:15,599 --> 01:21:17,449
She's going through a rough time after

981
01:21:17,448 --> 01:21:20,708
a life of luxury, and you feel sorry?

982
01:21:20,708 --> 01:21:23,969
You're the one I feel sorry for.

983
01:21:25,019 --> 01:21:30,548
It seems as though Hyeondo is sick.

984
01:21:30,548 --> 01:21:32,349
He's at the hospital.

985
01:21:32,349 --> 01:21:34,369
Hyeondo?

986
01:21:34,368 --> 01:21:35,988
How could a child be healthy

987
01:21:35,988 --> 01:21:38,318
when his parents have no morals?

988
01:21:38,319 --> 01:21:42,089
Karma passes down to children.

989
01:21:44,878 --> 01:21:48,588
Thank you for helping me in Russia.

990
01:21:49,208 --> 01:21:50,719
How could I say no to you?

991
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:53,029
I had to do it.

992
01:21:53,029 --> 01:21:54,419
So I was thinking,

993
01:21:54,418 --> 01:21:56,349
I heard you might end up

994
01:21:56,349 --> 01:21:59,159
taking over the company.

995
01:21:59,158 --> 01:22:01,429
There's an idea

996
01:22:01,429 --> 01:22:04,949
I've been developing for five years,

997
01:22:04,948 --> 01:22:07,768
and going to Russia gave me

998
01:22:07,769 --> 01:22:09,838
reaffirmation on my idea.

999
01:22:09,838 --> 01:22:12,259
So I was wondering

1000
01:22:12,259 --> 01:22:15,509
if you could give me a chance

1001
01:22:15,509 --> 01:22:17,958
to present that idea to you.

1002
01:22:21,838 --> 01:22:23,538
Please don't joke around with me.

1003
01:22:24,229 --> 01:22:25,689
I'm not...

1004
01:22:25,689 --> 01:22:29,369
Yes, I know I was hard on you,

1005
01:22:29,368 --> 01:22:31,448
and made your life difficult.

1006
01:22:31,448 --> 01:22:35,388
I saw talent when I saw you, so,

1007
01:22:35,389 --> 01:22:37,418
yes, like in Chinese novels,

1008
01:22:37,418 --> 01:22:38,969
in order to make someone a hero,

1009
01:22:38,969 --> 01:22:41,048
people around him

1010
01:22:41,048 --> 01:22:43,838
create hardships for him.

1011
01:22:43,838 --> 01:22:45,788
All Chinese heroes are like that.

1012
01:22:45,788 --> 01:22:47,918
They prevail over and over again,

1013
01:22:47,918 --> 01:22:48,908
and accomplish...

1014
01:22:48,908 --> 01:22:50,509
It's okay.

1015
01:22:50,509 --> 01:22:51,439
No, I...

1016
01:22:51,439 --> 01:22:53,479
I said it's okay!

1017
01:22:54,149 --> 01:22:55,459
Why do you keep bugging me!

1018
01:22:55,458 --> 01:22:56,958
I said it's okay!

1019
01:22:56,958 --> 01:22:58,498
Something great.

1020
01:23:00,849 --> 01:23:02,179
I think you're mistaken.

1021
01:23:02,179 --> 01:23:03,639
It's okay.

1022
01:23:03,639 --> 01:23:05,998
Sorry for cutting you off, but you're...

1023
01:23:06,569 --> 01:23:07,959
No, I'm not mistaken.

1024
01:23:07,958 --> 01:23:09,918
I think you're mistaken.

1025
01:23:09,918 --> 01:23:12,788
It's not like that. Just think about it.

1026
01:23:13,269 --> 01:23:16,099
When you asked me for a favor like that,

1027
01:23:16,099 --> 01:23:19,869
wasn't it because we are close?

1028
01:23:20,908 --> 01:23:22,538
- Yes. / - Right?

1029
01:23:22,538 --> 01:23:28,099
So since we share a special relationship,

1030
01:23:28,099 --> 01:23:29,069
let me present it in a special...

1031
01:23:29,069 --> 01:23:30,179
Jiwan.

1032
01:23:30,588 --> 01:23:31,658
Hi, Eunsu.

1033
01:23:31,658 --> 01:23:32,988
Ms. Han Eunsu!

1034
01:23:32,988 --> 01:23:35,088
Oh? Hello.

1035
01:23:35,088 --> 01:23:36,578
What are you doing here?

1036
01:23:38,809 --> 01:23:40,378
Huh?

1037
01:23:42,448 --> 01:23:44,469
She's my little sister.

1038
01:23:45,469 --> 01:23:46,989
Your real sister?

1039
01:23:46,988 --> 01:23:48,108
Yes.

1040
01:23:48,429 --> 01:23:53,059
But her last name's Han, and yours is Kim.

1041
01:23:54,698 --> 01:23:56,248
Jiwan, Eunsu.

1042
01:23:56,248 --> 01:23:58,139
- Hi, Aunt. / - Hi.

1043
01:23:58,729 --> 01:23:59,739
Remember?

1044
01:23:59,738 --> 01:24:02,428
This is Mr. Yun, my former team leader.

1045
01:24:02,429 --> 01:24:03,819
- Hello. / - She's my aunt.

1046
01:24:03,819 --> 01:24:04,779
Oh, Aunt.

1047
01:24:04,779 --> 01:24:08,319
Hello, I am Yun Oyong.

1048
01:24:09,838 --> 01:24:10,889
Hi.

1049
01:24:10,889 --> 01:24:14,139
I'm Park Haengsuk.

1050
01:24:14,139 --> 01:24:15,359
Excuse me?

1051
01:24:15,359 --> 01:24:17,199
Park...

1052
01:24:17,198 --> 01:24:20,978
You're his aunt, but your last name is Park?

1053
01:24:22,708 --> 01:24:28,028
Kim, Han and Park.

1054
01:24:28,029 --> 01:24:30,649
A family with different last names?

1055
01:24:35,988 --> 01:24:38,618
What happened?

1056
01:24:38,618 --> 01:24:40,198
Why is that office empty?

1057
01:24:40,198 --> 01:24:42,918
All the desks and chairs are gone.

1058
01:24:42,918 --> 01:24:44,519
Oh, that office?

1059
01:24:44,519 --> 01:24:46,019
They moved out.

1060
01:24:46,019 --> 01:24:47,769
They moved out?

1061
01:24:47,769 --> 01:24:49,949
Where did they go?

1062
01:24:49,948 --> 01:24:51,668
Where are my daughter and husband?

1063
01:24:51,668 --> 01:24:56,668
I heard they're pitching a tent at a farm.

1064
01:24:59,469 --> 01:25:01,019
A, a tent?

1065
01:25:07,878 --> 01:25:08,998
Oh,

1066
01:25:08,998 --> 01:25:12,488
I think we need to get a phone line fast.

1067
01:25:12,488 --> 01:25:13,768
When is the phone guy coming?

1068
01:25:13,769 --> 01:25:15,628
He'll be here at 3.

1069
01:25:15,628 --> 01:25:17,618
Where should the line go?

1070
01:25:17,618 --> 01:25:19,128
I'll find a spot.

1071
01:25:19,509 --> 01:25:20,819
I'll take that, Yeongju.

1072
01:25:27,908 --> 01:25:29,958
You shouldn't bite off more than you can chew,

1073
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:31,588
and mingle with your own kind!

1074
01:25:31,588 --> 01:25:34,788
You're suffering because of Jiwan!

1075
01:25:34,788 --> 01:25:36,688
It's my fault for signing a contract

1076
01:25:36,689 --> 01:25:39,259
that says the owner can evict us at any time.

1077
01:25:39,259 --> 01:25:40,969
How dare you side with Jiwan!

1078
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:42,939
I'm going to get him for this!

1079
01:25:44,069 --> 01:25:45,179
Honey, Mi...

1080
01:25:48,538 --> 01:25:50,088
What did Mom say?

1081
01:25:51,828 --> 01:25:54,728
She's going to get Jiwan.

1082
01:25:54,729 --> 01:25:56,039
What?

1083
01:25:56,819 --> 01:25:57,759
Seriously...

1084
01:25:57,759 --> 01:25:59,088
Let's hurry up.

1085
01:26:03,048 --> 01:26:04,538
Jiwan, you!

1086
01:26:04,779 --> 01:26:05,649
Hello.

1087
01:26:05,649 --> 01:26:06,949
Just a second.

1088
01:26:07,389 --> 01:26:08,659
Hello.

1089
01:26:09,439 --> 01:26:12,199
It's an important meeting. This way.

1090
01:26:12,649 --> 01:26:14,719
Everything looks great.

1091
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:18,418
I can see, now that I'm here.

1092
01:26:18,418 --> 01:26:22,048
You put up a makeshift office near the farm.

1093
01:26:22,048 --> 01:26:25,929
It shows your concern for quality control.

1094
01:26:25,929 --> 01:26:27,219
I just need to sign here, yes?

1095
01:26:27,219 --> 01:26:28,618
Yes.

1096
01:26:34,099 --> 01:26:35,269
Thank you.

1097
01:26:35,269 --> 01:26:36,239
I hope this works out great.

1098
01:26:36,238 --> 01:26:37,268
Thank you.

1099
01:26:42,929 --> 01:26:43,989
Goodbye.

1100
01:26:43,988 --> 01:26:46,268
That guy

1101
01:26:46,269 --> 01:26:47,969
is great at many things.

1102
01:26:47,969 --> 01:26:49,819
He's amazing.

1103
01:26:49,819 --> 01:26:52,239
He performs better under pressure.

1104
01:26:53,618 --> 01:26:56,128
Ms. Lee, it must've been hard to find us.

1105
01:26:56,128 --> 01:26:57,559
And it's such a hot day.

1106
01:26:57,559 --> 01:27:00,139
Let me get you something cool to drink.

1107
01:27:00,139 --> 01:27:01,458
Mr. Jang.

1108
01:27:07,548 --> 01:27:09,559
This is worth $30,000.

1109
01:27:14,088 --> 01:27:17,458
Dad, why did you say it was Jiwan's fault?

1110
01:27:17,458 --> 01:27:19,248
Hey, cut me some slack.

1111
01:27:19,248 --> 01:27:20,658
I was caught off guard.

1112
01:27:20,658 --> 01:27:21,988
It slipped out.

1113
01:27:21,988 --> 01:27:23,278
I can't believe you.

1114
01:27:23,578 --> 01:27:26,429
It's cooked. Yes, have some.

1115
01:27:27,708 --> 01:27:28,828
Director, you're here.

1116
01:27:28,828 --> 01:27:30,238
- Mr. Kang, you're here. / - Honey.

1117
01:27:30,238 --> 01:27:31,598
Yes.

1118
01:27:32,798 --> 01:27:34,088
What are you doing here?

1119
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:36,038
What do you think?

1120
01:27:36,038 --> 01:27:37,858
They are working so hard on a hot day,

1121
01:27:37,859 --> 01:27:39,379
so I bought them Korean pork

1122
01:27:39,378 --> 01:27:41,979
to help them restore some energy.

1123
01:27:41,979 --> 01:27:44,859
Domestic is always the best.

1124
01:27:44,859 --> 01:27:47,249
Of course. You're a wise man.

1125
01:27:48,788 --> 01:27:51,448
Honey, don't just stand there. Come and sit.

1126
01:27:51,448 --> 01:27:53,058
- Come here. / - Yeongju, come and sit down.

1127
01:27:53,059 --> 01:27:54,529
Yes, Yeongju, come and eat.

1128
01:27:54,529 --> 01:27:55,629
Let me go get some more lettuce.

1129
01:27:55,628 --> 01:27:56,838
Okay.

1130
01:28:03,059 --> 01:28:04,269
Wait,

1131
01:28:04,269 --> 01:28:06,429
weren't you mad at Jiwan?

1132
01:28:06,429 --> 01:28:07,779
What's going on?

1133
01:28:07,779 --> 01:28:09,059
Oh, I can't believe you.

1134
01:28:09,059 --> 01:28:11,119
When? People might actually believe that.

1135
01:28:11,118 --> 01:28:13,219
Why would I talk badly about Jiwan?

1136
01:28:13,219 --> 01:28:16,689
When I came here, Jiwan was doing great,

1137
01:28:16,689 --> 01:28:19,479
so I bought him Korean pork,

1138
01:28:19,479 --> 01:28:21,418
to help him restore energy.

1139
01:28:21,418 --> 01:28:23,878
Why are you just sitting there?

1140
01:28:23,878 --> 01:28:25,658
Go and help wash the lettuce.

1141
01:28:25,658 --> 01:28:26,848
Go help Jiwan.

1142
01:28:27,298 --> 01:28:28,769
Okay.

1143
01:28:30,418 --> 01:28:34,198
I'm a great judge of character.

1144
01:28:34,198 --> 01:28:38,009
Mom, just have one spoonful.

1145
01:28:38,009 --> 01:28:38,878
Say ah.

1146
01:28:38,878 --> 01:28:41,858
I don't want any chicken porridge.

1147
01:28:41,859 --> 01:28:44,789
It's not just chicken. It has ginseng, too.

1148
01:28:44,788 --> 01:28:47,288
You need to eat warm food in the summer,

1149
01:28:47,288 --> 01:28:49,958
so you can restore energy, okay?

1150
01:28:49,958 --> 01:28:52,179
Just have one spoonful.

1151
01:28:52,179 --> 01:28:53,309
Say ah.

1152
01:28:59,238 --> 01:29:01,158
See?

1153
01:29:01,158 --> 01:29:04,048
You're upset because of what you said.

1154
01:29:04,048 --> 01:29:06,469
I didn't say anything wrong.

1155
01:29:06,469 --> 01:29:09,828
Imagine how Seonhui and Eunsu must feel.

1156
01:29:09,828 --> 01:29:12,768
You're worried about Eunsu, aren't you?

1157
01:29:14,479 --> 01:29:16,149
I hope she gets over Hyeondo,

1158
01:29:16,149 --> 01:29:18,599
and meets someone nice.

1159
01:29:19,559 --> 01:29:21,878
I'm sure she will.

1160
01:29:22,469 --> 01:29:25,139
Couples form and break up all the time.

1161
01:29:27,269 --> 01:29:30,338
Jiwan doesn't have a girlfriend?

1162
01:29:30,338 --> 01:29:33,588
Jiwan has no time for that.

1163
01:29:35,729 --> 01:29:36,939
This?

1164
01:29:40,238 --> 01:29:41,738
You see,

1165
01:29:42,219 --> 01:29:45,849
here are the size and unit.

1166
01:29:49,109 --> 01:29:51,088
Hi.

1167
01:29:53,399 --> 01:29:56,609
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

1168
01:29:56,908 --> 01:29:59,058
Don't say that. I'm glad you're here.

1169
01:29:59,059 --> 01:30:00,739
But why are you here?

1170
01:30:03,179 --> 01:30:05,618
Oh, I'm stuffed.

1171
01:30:05,618 --> 01:30:09,498
You must really love spicy chicken stew.

1172
01:30:09,498 --> 01:30:10,978
You ate a lot of it.

1173
01:30:10,979 --> 01:30:12,479
Because it was delicious.

1174
01:30:15,439 --> 01:30:18,569
It's late, so take Yeongju home.

1175
01:30:18,569 --> 01:30:20,689
It's okay. I can go home alone.

1176
01:30:21,118 --> 01:30:22,038
Don't say that.

1177
01:30:22,038 --> 01:30:24,318
It's late. What if you get kidnapped?

1178
01:30:24,319 --> 01:30:25,419
Take her home.

1179
01:30:25,418 --> 01:30:26,929
No, that's not going to happen.

1180
01:30:26,929 --> 01:30:28,489
Don't say that. Just go.

1181
01:30:28,488 --> 01:30:30,058
What are you two doing?

1182
01:30:30,059 --> 01:30:31,458
Let's go. I'll walk you home.

1183
01:30:31,458 --> 01:30:33,368
- What? / - Go home, and go to bed.

1184
01:30:33,368 --> 01:30:34,648
- Let's go, Yeongju. / - Bye.

1185
01:30:34,649 --> 01:30:35,609
Okay.

1186
01:30:35,609 --> 01:30:36,969
- Bye. / - Goodnight.

1187
01:30:48,878 --> 01:30:51,009
Are those two dating?

1188
01:30:51,698 --> 01:30:53,818
They're not together yet,

1189
01:30:53,819 --> 01:30:56,739
but they are testing the waters.

1190
01:30:58,559 --> 01:31:01,239
It's frustrating to watch them.

1191
01:31:01,238 --> 01:31:02,868
Yeongju...

1192
01:31:03,599 --> 01:31:05,029
She's nice.

1193
01:31:05,029 --> 01:31:06,369
She is.

1194
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:08,558
She's pretty and pleasant.

1195
01:31:08,559 --> 01:31:11,809
And she's a teacher.

1196
01:31:11,809 --> 01:31:12,958
Don't you think they look good together?

1197
01:31:12,958 --> 01:31:14,648
Yes, they do.

1198
01:31:25,099 --> 01:31:26,319
(Unique Spicy Chicken Stew)

1199
01:31:50,668 --> 01:31:53,198
Ms. Kang Yeongju, what's all this?

1200
01:31:53,198 --> 01:31:55,058
Why are you cooking all of a sudden?

1201
01:31:56,748 --> 01:31:58,328
I'm just practicing.

1202
01:31:58,738 --> 01:32:00,278
Practicing?

1203
01:32:03,929 --> 01:32:06,099
Oh, I get it.

1204
01:32:06,099 --> 01:32:07,128
Girl...

1205
01:32:07,128 --> 01:32:10,519
You have a good eye.

1206
01:32:10,519 --> 01:32:11,329
What do you mean?

1207
01:32:11,328 --> 01:32:13,208
Jiwan.

1208
01:32:13,208 --> 01:32:14,889
Who cares about education?

1209
01:32:14,889 --> 01:32:18,389
To me, money trumps everything.

1210
01:32:18,389 --> 01:32:21,389
Stop getting ahead of yourself.

1211
01:32:23,908 --> 01:32:25,748
Seonhui is a decent mother-in-law.

1212
01:32:25,748 --> 01:32:28,028
Eunsu is easy.

1213
01:32:28,029 --> 01:32:31,459
The grandmother-in-law will become forgetful.

1214
01:32:32,069 --> 01:32:36,009
Haengsuk. She's the one to watch out for.

1215
01:32:36,009 --> 01:32:37,899
I'm sick of your marriage talk.

1216
01:32:37,899 --> 01:32:39,259
I told you it's not like that.

1217
01:32:39,259 --> 01:32:40,128
Just leave me alone.

1218
01:32:40,128 --> 01:32:43,019
How could I leave you alone?

1219
01:32:43,019 --> 01:32:44,668
You won't go on blind dates,

1220
01:32:44,668 --> 01:32:46,998
but you can't even make Jiwan yours.

1221
01:32:48,048 --> 01:32:49,538
If it were me in the old days,

1222
01:32:49,538 --> 01:32:51,458
I would've already...

1223
01:32:52,208 --> 01:32:53,929
What's the use of giving you my looks?

1224
01:32:53,929 --> 01:32:55,578
Just look at yourself.

1225
01:32:55,578 --> 01:32:58,658
You're dressed like a tomboy,

1226
01:32:58,658 --> 01:33:00,538
and you haven't taken a shower.

1227
01:33:00,538 --> 01:33:03,488
You need to make yourself look pretty!

1228
01:33:03,488 --> 01:33:06,178
Practicing cooking won't help you at all.

1229
01:33:06,179 --> 01:33:08,679
If a girl is pretty, nothing else matters.

1230
01:33:08,679 --> 01:33:10,149
You have to look pretty!

1231
01:33:10,149 --> 01:33:12,009
What good will cooking do for you?

1232
01:33:12,009 --> 01:33:13,378
Besides your pretty face,

1233
01:33:13,378 --> 01:33:16,128
you got nothing from me!

1234
01:33:16,128 --> 01:33:18,439
What do you mean? Like this?

1235
01:33:21,399 --> 01:33:22,569
Oh, you're impossible.

1236
01:33:22,569 --> 01:33:25,019
You're my daughter, but you're impossible!

1237
01:33:25,019 --> 01:33:27,889
Be more like Oh Minja! Like me!

1238
01:33:30,469 --> 01:33:31,538
Minja.

1239
01:33:31,538 --> 01:33:32,458
Oh!

1240
01:33:32,458 --> 01:33:33,429
Ms. Lee!

1241
01:33:33,429 --> 01:33:34,479
What are you doing here?

1242
01:33:34,479 --> 01:33:37,779
I need a new pillow for my neck pain.

1243
01:33:37,779 --> 01:33:39,269
What about you?

1244
01:33:39,908 --> 01:33:42,759
Yeongju's been complaining about neck pain, too.

1245
01:33:44,048 --> 01:33:45,328
Well,

1246
01:33:45,328 --> 01:33:48,938
is Yeongju still going on blind dates?

1247
01:33:50,418 --> 01:33:51,748
I've given up on that.

1248
01:33:51,748 --> 01:33:53,099
How they feel about each other is important,

1249
01:33:53,099 --> 01:33:54,828
not their background.

1250
01:33:55,279 --> 01:33:58,089
You're right!

1251
01:33:58,088 --> 01:34:03,269
But I heard you hold education very high.

1252
01:34:04,149 --> 01:34:07,439
If they're in love, education doesn't matter.

1253
01:34:07,439 --> 01:34:10,479
As long as he's hard-working, it's fine.

1254
01:34:11,219 --> 01:34:16,338
But isn't a small family better?

1255
01:34:17,168 --> 01:34:20,509
I would prefer a small family,

1256
01:34:20,509 --> 01:34:21,908
but these days, as complicated as it is,

1257
01:34:21,908 --> 01:34:25,198
people don't live with married children.

1258
01:34:25,198 --> 01:34:27,618
- You mean live separately? / - Yes.

1259
01:34:28,759 --> 01:34:30,319
But that's...

1260
01:34:30,319 --> 01:34:32,159
Well...

1261
01:34:32,158 --> 01:34:34,528
Old people don't live forever.

1262
01:34:34,529 --> 01:34:37,229
And I'm dying to have a great-grandchild.

1263
01:34:37,759 --> 01:34:40,279
I'm not going to let my daughter

1264
01:34:40,279 --> 01:34:42,089
date anyone with a large family.

1265
01:34:42,088 --> 01:34:44,498
What if she gets stuck with them?

1266
01:34:44,498 --> 01:34:46,318
That won't be good.

1267
01:34:47,948 --> 01:34:51,128
Yes, getting stuck is the key.

1268
01:34:51,469 --> 01:34:53,239
As long as they live separately,

1269
01:34:53,238 --> 01:34:55,808
you don't mind a big family?

1270
01:34:55,809 --> 01:34:57,359
Of course not.

1271
01:34:57,359 --> 01:34:59,659
As long as they are in love.

1272
01:35:00,538 --> 01:35:01,429
Why do you ask?

1273
01:35:01,429 --> 01:35:05,219
You have someone in mind?

1274
01:35:05,219 --> 01:35:06,668
Of course.

1275
01:35:08,488 --> 01:35:10,648
- You do? / - Yes.

1276
01:35:21,819 --> 01:35:24,589
Hello, I'm Ha Yeongho from Daehan Daily.

1277
01:35:24,588 --> 01:35:28,349
Someone tipped me off about Taehu Industry.

1278
01:35:28,349 --> 01:35:31,389
You drove Taehu Industry into bankruptcy,

1279
01:35:31,389 --> 01:35:34,599
and stole millions in funds. Is that true?

1280
01:35:34,599 --> 01:35:36,179
There are protocols for reporters...

1281
01:35:36,179 --> 01:35:37,769
Your former employee Lee Seokjin, and

1282
01:35:37,769 --> 01:35:40,489
former directors will be giving statements!

1283
01:35:40,488 --> 01:35:41,878
Tell me if it's true,

1284
01:35:41,878 --> 01:35:44,128
or if it's slander!

1285
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:47,038
President Jang!

1286
01:35:47,038 --> 01:35:48,158
Please leave.

1287
01:35:51,469 --> 01:35:53,498
Refuse all interviews.

1288
01:35:54,118 --> 01:35:55,658
It wasn't Kim Jiwan.

1289
01:35:56,548 --> 01:35:58,988
Don't jump the gun, or get them involved.

1290
01:35:58,988 --> 01:36:01,028
I'm sure the reporter heard a rumor.

1291
01:36:02,899 --> 01:36:04,128
If he had all the evidence,

1292
01:36:04,128 --> 01:36:06,248
he would've written about it already.

1293
01:36:07,009 --> 01:36:09,498
I'm coming in, so make sure no one talks.

1294
01:36:09,498 --> 01:36:12,849
I told you to find him, by any means!

1295
01:36:12,849 --> 01:36:13,689
What are you doing?

1296
01:36:13,689 --> 01:36:15,519
Is it that you can't or won't?

1297
01:36:17,878 --> 01:36:19,599
Seokjin was

1298
01:36:19,599 --> 01:36:22,338
with us from the birth of Taehu Industry,

1299
01:36:22,338 --> 01:36:24,338
and is still with us today.

1300
01:36:25,418 --> 01:36:28,628
Dongjin still calls us to congratulate us

1301
01:36:28,628 --> 01:36:31,038
whenever we reach a new milestone.

1302
01:36:32,429 --> 01:36:36,288
Hyeokju practically lived with us

1303
01:36:36,288 --> 01:36:37,969
at the factory.

1304
01:36:39,088 --> 01:36:41,548
So how could I

1305
01:36:41,548 --> 01:36:44,958
dig into their past, and make threats?

1306
01:36:45,939 --> 01:36:47,469
Taesu!

1307
01:36:50,899 --> 01:36:53,429
You've been paid off, too?

1308
01:36:55,889 --> 01:36:58,979
I know you met with Seokjin.

1309
01:36:58,979 --> 01:37:01,159
I wasn't sure.

1310
01:37:01,649 --> 01:37:02,969
So, what did you get from them?

1311
01:37:02,969 --> 01:37:05,899
How much did they pay you!

1312
01:37:06,529 --> 01:37:07,919
Taesu...

1313
01:37:07,918 --> 01:37:09,168
Get out.

1314
01:37:09,168 --> 01:37:10,148
You're fired!

1315
01:37:10,149 --> 01:37:11,519
Get lost!

1316
01:38:13,668 --> 01:38:15,318
Hyeondo,

1317
01:38:16,048 --> 01:38:18,778
I once told your father

1318
01:38:18,779 --> 01:38:21,069
to watch his back because of you.

1319
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:26,059
And he said to me,

1320
01:38:27,719 --> 01:38:29,779
even if you betrayed him, that was okay.

1321
01:38:30,979 --> 01:38:32,958
Because you're his son.

1322
01:38:37,069 --> 01:38:39,089
Look after Taesu.

1323
01:38:41,309 --> 01:38:43,809
I can't seem to do it anymore.

1324
01:39:37,698 --> 01:39:41,048
Is this Mr. Han Yeongho of Daehan Daily?

1325
01:39:41,048 --> 01:39:42,918
This is Kim Jiwan.

1326
01:39:44,149 --> 01:39:47,539
Can we have that interview tomorrow?

1327
01:39:54,609 --> 01:39:56,229
Yes, Mr. Han.

1328
01:39:57,488 --> 01:39:59,168
I'm on my way.

1329
01:40:57,849 --> 01:40:59,409
Your father was going to

1330
01:41:00,618 --> 01:41:04,208
hand over his company to my father?

1331
01:41:07,488 --> 01:41:09,988
I couldn't understand him at first,

1332
01:41:12,269 --> 01:41:15,269
but now that I think about it,

1333
01:41:15,269 --> 01:41:17,199
I can understand him a little bit.

1334
01:41:30,748 --> 01:41:32,868
This is all the evidence I've collected.

1335
01:41:37,229 --> 01:41:39,119
Why are you giving them to me?

1336
01:41:44,259 --> 01:41:46,279
Why did you

1337
01:41:46,279 --> 01:41:48,439
give me that notebook?

1338
01:42:21,838 --> 01:42:23,158
Have you had a lot to drink?

1339
01:42:24,488 --> 01:42:28,009
You asked me here, so why are you late?

1340
01:42:32,628 --> 01:42:34,559
I met Jiwan.

1341
01:42:37,988 --> 01:42:40,268
Uncle Sangjun

1342
01:42:41,948 --> 01:42:45,259
was going to give you all his money?

1343
01:42:46,009 --> 01:42:47,918
That's a lie.

1344
01:42:48,689 --> 01:42:50,609
Right?

1345
01:42:54,069 --> 01:42:56,929
Who would actually do that?

1346
01:42:56,929 --> 01:42:59,259
Why would he give you his company

1347
01:42:59,259 --> 01:43:01,878
when he has a son and a family?

1348
01:43:01,878 --> 01:43:03,798
That's ridiculous.

1349
01:43:04,458 --> 01:43:06,278
You were just a friend.

1350
01:43:07,399 --> 01:43:09,189
Not his blood.

1351
01:43:13,219 --> 01:43:15,128
Don't you agree?

1352
01:43:16,769 --> 01:43:18,349
Yes.

1353
01:43:18,948 --> 01:43:20,928
I'm not his blood.

1354
01:43:23,819 --> 01:43:26,129
But,

1355
01:43:26,958 --> 01:43:29,708
even though I wasn't his blood,

1356
01:43:29,708 --> 01:43:33,349
Sangjun might have actually really

1357
01:43:33,349 --> 01:43:37,498
wanted to give me his company.

1358
01:43:40,488 --> 01:43:44,058
But why...

1359
01:43:44,059 --> 01:43:46,579
How could he trust me so much?

1360
01:44:24,048 --> 01:44:25,288
Jiwan.

1361
01:44:28,689 --> 01:44:32,029
Do you

1362
01:44:32,029 --> 01:44:34,909
remember Dad?

1363
01:44:37,939 --> 01:44:39,798
A little bit.

1364
01:44:42,908 --> 01:44:48,648
What kind of person was he?

1365
01:44:51,529 --> 01:44:54,719
He smiled at me whenever he saw me.

1366
01:45:02,269 --> 01:45:04,829
Why did

1367
01:45:06,698 --> 01:45:11,009
Dad trust a man like him?

1368
01:45:13,198 --> 01:45:15,798
He was so foolish.

1369
01:45:20,269 --> 01:45:23,248
You think so, too, don't you?

1370
01:46:33,948 --> 01:46:35,368
How have you been?

1371
01:46:48,248 --> 01:46:50,318
Don't turn bad.

1372
01:46:52,788 --> 01:46:55,458
That's not who you are, Hyeondo.

1373
01:47:06,389 --> 01:47:07,998
I should go.

1374
01:47:48,009 --> 01:47:49,248
The Korean Businessmen's Association

1375
01:47:49,248 --> 01:47:53,068
recommended you as a next chairperson.

1376
01:47:53,529 --> 01:47:57,459
You're to give an acceptance speech.

1377
01:47:58,908 --> 01:48:00,148
Okay.

1378
01:48:00,149 --> 01:48:01,628
I got it.

1379
01:48:02,208 --> 01:48:03,658
Oh, and

1380
01:48:03,658 --> 01:48:05,759
call my wife's lawyer,

1381
01:48:05,759 --> 01:48:07,779
and have him visit me here.

1382
01:48:07,779 --> 01:48:09,219
Yes, sir.

1383
01:48:17,309 --> 01:48:19,259
President Jang wants to see you

1384
01:48:19,259 --> 01:48:21,139
before going to court.

1385
01:48:22,439 --> 01:48:24,069
What is it about?

1386
01:48:24,069 --> 01:48:26,659
He said he will tell you in person.

1387
01:49:20,149 --> 01:49:23,349
You like the coffee here, don't you?

1388
01:49:23,349 --> 01:49:26,279
You didn't call me here for coffee.

1389
01:49:26,279 --> 01:49:28,279
What is this about?

1390
01:49:29,328 --> 01:49:31,538
I called you over to have a cup of coffee.

1391
01:49:32,389 --> 01:49:34,009
Excuse me.

1392
01:49:55,788 --> 01:49:59,028
I came because you like it here,

1393
01:49:59,029 --> 01:50:00,649
but to me, the company

1394
01:50:00,649 --> 01:50:03,798
vending machine coffee's the best.

1395
01:50:05,019 --> 01:50:09,079
You've always had cheap taste.

1396
01:50:09,078 --> 01:50:10,418
What?

1397
01:50:10,418 --> 01:50:12,599
You hate me because of my cheap taste?

1398
01:50:13,168 --> 01:50:15,548
No,

1399
01:50:15,548 --> 01:50:17,778
it was easy for me.

1400
01:50:20,469 --> 01:50:22,149
Successful men

1401
01:50:22,149 --> 01:50:25,699
always get a mistress first.

1402
01:50:25,698 --> 01:50:27,998
But

1403
01:50:27,998 --> 01:50:31,059
you have simple taste in everything.

1404
01:50:31,059 --> 01:50:33,208
Vending machine coffee, soju,

1405
01:50:33,208 --> 01:50:35,248
and roasted rice tea after meals.

1406
01:50:36,529 --> 01:50:39,119
And with women, only Jeong Sugyeong.

1407
01:50:40,878 --> 01:50:44,068
I did have simple taste,

1408
01:50:44,069 --> 01:50:46,669
but it was never cheap.

1409
01:50:49,559 --> 01:50:54,458
I loved having you

1410
01:50:54,458 --> 01:50:56,248
as my husband.

1411
01:50:59,078 --> 01:51:02,418
I respected you

1412
01:51:02,418 --> 01:51:07,238
more than anyone.

1413
01:51:12,088 --> 01:51:15,158
If you are willing to change,

1414
01:51:15,158 --> 01:51:18,088
nothing will change between us.

1415
01:51:26,109 --> 01:51:30,769
Will Jeong Sugyeong still love Jang Taesu

1416
01:51:30,769 --> 01:51:34,039
without his money and honor?

1417
01:51:37,809 --> 01:51:41,168
That's why it can't be, Ms. Jeong.

1418
01:51:52,069 --> 01:51:53,659
This is the divorce papers.

1419
01:51:53,658 --> 01:51:55,679
I already signed it,

1420
01:51:55,679 --> 01:51:57,708
so you take care of the rest.

1421
01:53:41,238 --> 01:53:44,458
Are you sure you want to let this go?

1422
01:53:45,588 --> 01:53:48,078
You won't regret it?

1423
01:53:49,899 --> 01:53:52,329
That was what Father wanted.

1424
01:53:53,569 --> 01:53:55,849
If President Jang

1425
01:53:55,849 --> 01:53:59,719
doesn't change his ways after finding out

1426
01:54:00,618 --> 01:54:03,318
what Father wanted, he'll be more miserable.

1427
01:54:23,639 --> 01:54:26,779
Hello, everyone.

1428
01:54:26,779 --> 01:54:29,289
I'm Jang Taesu from Best Global,

1429
01:54:29,288 --> 01:54:32,728
who recently won Businessman of the Year.

1430
01:54:38,679 --> 01:54:42,578
There are many senior entrepreneurs

1431
01:54:42,578 --> 01:54:44,389
and colleagues who deserve the award,

1432
01:54:44,389 --> 01:54:46,118
so I feel a very big responsibility

1433
01:54:46,118 --> 01:54:48,358
to win this accolade.

1434
01:54:48,798 --> 01:54:53,469
And it's an honor to have the position

1435
01:54:53,469 --> 01:54:56,469
to represent all entrepreneurs.

1436
01:54:57,868 --> 01:55:01,679
Sitting here

1437
01:55:01,679 --> 01:55:04,288
brings back old memories.

1438
01:55:07,059 --> 01:55:12,498
I had a friend.

1439
01:55:13,088 --> 01:55:17,059
He trusted me when I had nothing,

1440
01:55:17,059 --> 01:55:21,639
and helped me get to where I am today.

1441
01:55:22,238 --> 01:55:24,458
He was the president of Taehu Industry

1442
01:55:24,458 --> 01:55:27,559
where Best Global began.

1443
01:55:30,939 --> 01:55:33,338
Kim Sangjun.

1444
01:55:35,279 --> 01:55:39,049
That was my friend's name.

1445
01:55:39,668 --> 01:55:42,988
He was naively trusting,

1446
01:55:42,988 --> 01:55:45,468
and honest

1447
01:55:45,469 --> 01:55:49,139
even to a fault.

1448
01:55:50,469 --> 01:55:53,208
I considered his company

1449
01:55:53,208 --> 01:55:56,658
as my own,

1450
01:55:57,979 --> 01:56:00,909
and worked hard.

1451
01:56:08,748 --> 01:56:12,009
But,

1452
01:56:12,009 --> 01:56:16,059
I

1453
01:56:16,059 --> 01:56:19,179
stole...

1454
01:56:31,899 --> 01:56:34,319
All of his money.

1455
01:56:37,219 --> 01:56:38,689
What did he just say?

1456
01:56:56,969 --> 01:57:00,708
Yeongju, summarize this register, please.

1457
01:57:02,658 --> 01:57:04,278
May I help you?

1458
01:57:08,139 --> 01:57:10,328
Mr. Jang Hyeondo.

1459
01:57:10,328 --> 01:57:13,068
How dare you come here!

1460
01:57:14,158 --> 01:57:15,888
Jang Hyeondo?

1461
01:57:16,769 --> 01:57:18,869
You're that guy?

1462
01:57:18,868 --> 01:57:20,208
How dare you show your face here?

1463
01:57:20,208 --> 01:57:21,898
Get out.

1464
01:57:35,298 --> 01:57:37,488
I'm sorry.

1465
01:57:38,719 --> 01:57:41,948
That's all I can say.

1466
01:57:52,099 --> 01:57:53,639
Yes.

1467
01:57:54,529 --> 01:58:00,079
I tricked my trusting friend's family,

1468
01:58:00,078 --> 01:58:03,698
and bought their shares for pennies.

1469
01:58:03,698 --> 01:58:08,078
And I even kicked his family out

1470
01:58:08,078 --> 01:58:11,009
from their house.

1471
01:58:15,099 --> 01:58:17,838
And so I used

1472
01:58:17,838 --> 01:58:21,908
the stolen money,

1473
01:58:23,868 --> 01:58:28,038
and built my own company.

1474
01:58:38,828 --> 01:58:40,988
(Taehu Industry Stock Certificate, $2.5 Million)

1475
01:59:22,029 --> 01:59:23,459

(KBS 2TV, Weekend Drama, Bluebird's House)

1477
02:00:47,128 --> 02:00:48,078
I knew then,

(Best Global's Jang Taesu Confesses to Embezzlement)

1479
02:00:49,399 --> 02:00:53,409
I would regret it for the rest of my life.

1480
02:00:53,408 --> 02:00:55,868
Sangjun

1481
02:00:55,868 --> 02:00:58,759
might have died because of me.

1482
02:00:59,958 --> 02:01:01,938
He's giving you what?

1483
02:01:01,939 --> 02:01:03,119
Stocks.

1484
02:01:03,118 --> 02:01:06,259
And he's resigning from his position.

1485
02:01:07,088 --> 02:01:10,048
Why are they so dense,

1486
02:01:10,048 --> 02:01:11,198
when I'm trying to help them?

1487
02:01:11,198 --> 02:01:13,208
They should at least try to

1488
02:01:13,208 --> 02:01:14,559
go on a few dates.

1489
02:01:14,559 --> 02:01:16,729
You're going to let Father be as he is?

1490
02:01:16,729 --> 02:01:19,969
Ma'am, get me a glass of ice water!

1491
02:02:03,509 --> 04:04:08,657
(Episode 49)

1492
02:02:05,149 --> 02:02:06,679
What is it?

1493
02:02:07,448 --> 02:02:09,918
You think with Lee Seokjin and some old

1494
02:02:09,918 --> 02:02:11,969
directors, you can turn the tables?

1495
02:02:12,418 --> 02:02:14,358
It's not that simple in the real world.

1496
02:02:16,809 --> 02:02:18,998
Is that your way of doing things?

1497
02:02:20,378 --> 02:02:22,958
Betraying a friend that trusts you,

1498
02:02:22,958 --> 02:02:25,479
and stealing all of his money?

1499
02:02:26,189 --> 02:02:29,168
Sangjun asked for this, do you know?

1500
02:02:29,168 --> 02:02:30,958
Is that why you wanted my father to die?

1501
02:02:30,958 --> 02:02:33,809
I said he was already dead when I got there!

1502
02:02:37,088 --> 02:02:38,408
Sure.

1503
02:02:40,509 --> 02:02:43,649
Wherever you go and whomever you meet,

1504
02:02:43,649 --> 02:02:45,449
keep telling that story.

1505
02:02:46,399 --> 02:02:48,429
Even if

1506
02:02:48,429 --> 02:02:51,739
you made my father die,

1507
02:02:51,738 --> 02:02:53,868
don't ever speak of it.

1508
02:02:53,868 --> 02:02:55,488
Ever.

1509
02:02:56,969 --> 02:02:59,548
If not,

1510
02:03:00,229 --> 02:03:03,009
I would have to feel sorry for my father

1511
02:03:03,009 --> 02:03:05,488
for being too foolish

1512
02:03:05,488 --> 02:03:06,898
to have trusted you so much.

1513
02:03:12,399 --> 02:03:14,489
It was for you.

1514
02:03:16,658 --> 02:03:18,509
For you,

1515
02:03:20,149 --> 02:03:22,679
for an ingrate like you,

1516
02:03:24,969 --> 02:03:27,078
my father did all the work.

1517
02:03:32,809 --> 02:03:35,958
From the beginning, my father prepared

1518
02:03:35,958 --> 02:03:39,528
all the money and paperwork for you.

1519
02:03:40,988 --> 02:03:44,298
Even if you hadn't stolen the money,

1520
02:03:44,298 --> 02:03:47,679
if you just let things run its course,

1521
02:03:47,679 --> 02:03:50,189
you would've eventually gotten all of it.

1522
02:03:54,149 --> 02:03:57,949
I understand that you're an engineer,

1523
02:03:57,948 --> 02:03:59,969
but what about running the company?

1524
02:03:59,969 --> 02:04:02,609
Asking me to manage the money is...

1525
02:04:02,609 --> 02:04:05,889
If you do it, it'll be like I'm doing it.

1526
02:04:05,889 --> 02:04:07,149
Sangjun, still...

1527
02:04:07,149 --> 02:04:08,959
On top of that,

1528
02:04:08,958 --> 02:04:11,889
I don't know if I need to run the company.

1529
02:04:11,889 --> 02:04:13,038
I want to hire someone capable,

1530
02:04:13,038 --> 02:04:14,578
and have him run it the way he wants.

1531
02:04:14,578 --> 02:04:16,338
I can focus on technology development,

1532
02:04:16,338 --> 02:04:19,248
and he can help grow the company.

(Taehu Industry Stock Certificate, $2.5 Million)

1538
02:05:41,078 --> 02:05:45,268
Talk about lying through your teeth.

1539
02:05:45,719 --> 02:05:47,969
Who in the world

1540
02:05:47,969 --> 02:05:49,578
gives all his money to his friend

1541
02:05:49,578 --> 02:05:52,068
when he has his own family,

1542
02:05:52,069 --> 02:05:55,119
his own parents, and a wife?

1543
02:05:55,118 --> 02:05:57,389
I don't understand, either.

1544
02:05:58,889 --> 02:06:01,479
If he was alive, I'd love to ask him

1545
02:06:03,109 --> 02:06:05,519
why he trusted someone like you.

1546
02:06:07,219 --> 02:06:09,689
What kind of crazy idiot would

1547
02:06:09,689 --> 02:06:13,239
trust his friend with all his money?

1548
02:06:15,359 --> 02:06:18,779
You think I would believe that nonsense?

1549
02:06:20,569 --> 02:06:22,729
Taehu Industry's attorney Hong Mungi.

1550
02:06:24,689 --> 02:06:26,859
He was one of the people you fired

1551
02:06:26,859 --> 02:06:29,329
when Taehu Industry filed for bankruptcy.

1552
02:06:30,899 --> 02:06:32,849
You can ask him.

Taesu, what time will you be back?

02:07:47,878 --> 02:07:51,349
Well, I think I'll finish around 5.

1557
02:07:51,349 --> 02:07:53,219
I'll see you then.

1558
02:07:53,219 --> 02:07:55,759
I have something to tell you.

1559
02:07:55,759 --> 02:07:57,498
What is it? Tell me now.

1560
02:07:57,498 --> 02:07:58,418
I'll tell you later.

Don't be late.

and something to give you.

ask Taesu for help.

Don't say such a thing.

1569
02:09:08,208 --> 02:09:09,908
I'm saying, just in case.

1570
02:09:25,099 --> 02:09:26,559
Hello?

1571
02:09:36,679 --> 02:09:39,969
Who is this, so early in the morning?

1572
02:09:42,189 --> 02:09:44,029
Do you remember me?

1573

President Jang!

1574
02:09:47,878 --> 02:09:49,168
- Come in. / - No, no, wait.

1575
02:09:49,168 --> 02:09:50,979
My coming in isn't important right now.

1576
02:09:51,309 --> 02:09:55,849
Did you meet Sangjun's son Kim Jiwan?

1577
02:09:55,849 --> 02:09:57,418
Did you see him a few days ago?

1578
02:09:57,418 --> 02:10:01,788
Yes, I met Jiwan a few days ago.

1579
02:10:02,618 --> 02:10:05,168
What did you two talk about?

1580
02:10:05,828 --> 02:10:08,759
He asked about the financial state

1581
02:10:08,759 --> 02:10:12,418
of Mr. Kim when he passed away.

1582
02:10:12,418 --> 02:10:17,689
Is there any legal problems?

1583
02:10:19,279 --> 02:10:20,679
Yes,

1584
02:10:20,679 --> 02:10:22,989
when Sangjun died,

1585
02:10:22,988 --> 02:10:25,108
what happened to his assets?

1586
02:10:25,109 --> 02:10:28,649
You know that better than I do.

1587
02:10:28,649 --> 02:10:31,709
He turned everything into cash,

1588
02:10:31,708 --> 02:10:34,418
and invested it into his company.

1589
02:10:34,418 --> 02:10:35,689
Invested it,

1590
02:10:35,689 --> 02:10:36,969
yes.

1591
02:10:36,969 --> 02:10:38,298
Yes, that's right.

1592
02:10:38,298 --> 02:10:39,708
He invested all of it.

1593
02:10:39,708 --> 02:10:41,918
He didn't plan on giving it to me, right?

1594
02:10:41,918 --> 02:10:49,099
He said he was making you the president.

1595
02:10:49,099 --> 02:10:53,538
Isn't that the same thing?

1596
02:11:01,538 --> 02:11:06,309
I want to give Taesu a chance.

1597
02:11:06,309 --> 02:11:07,859
I want to make it

1598
02:11:07,859 --> 02:11:10,619
so that he can make this company grow.

1599
02:11:10,618 --> 02:11:12,288
Mr. Kim,

1600
02:11:12,288 --> 02:11:14,908
what about your family?

1601
02:11:15,519 --> 02:11:19,349
Putting him in charge of the money is...

1602
02:11:20,219 --> 02:11:23,259
This investment is for my family.

1603
02:11:23,259 --> 02:11:24,828
Excuse me?

1604
02:11:26,649 --> 02:11:28,729
I'm not sure

1605
02:11:28,729 --> 02:11:31,009
how much longer

1606
02:11:31,009 --> 02:11:32,809
my heart will last.

1607
02:11:34,179 --> 02:11:38,158
Without me, what will happen to my mother,

1608
02:11:38,158 --> 02:11:39,668
my wife, and kids?

1609
02:11:41,439 --> 02:11:44,199
Anyone can talk my mother into signing

1610
02:11:44,198 --> 02:11:46,759
any document they want, and my wife

1611
02:11:46,759 --> 02:11:50,819
does not know how to deal with my mother.

1612
02:11:50,819 --> 02:11:55,339
I need someone to be there for my family.

1613
02:11:55,338 --> 02:11:58,708
Money aside, I know Taesu will

1614
02:11:58,708 --> 02:12:01,509
take great care of my family.

1615
02:12:02,729 --> 02:12:07,249
I know what kind of man he is.

1616
02:12:15,889 --> 02:12:18,748
President Jang...

1617
02:12:22,969 --> 02:12:25,139
You,

1618
02:12:25,139 --> 02:12:26,909
you're lying, aren't you?

1619
02:12:26,908 --> 02:12:28,148
How much money did Kim Jiwan give you?

1620
02:12:28,149 --> 02:12:29,838
How much did it take to pay you off?

1621
02:12:29,838 --> 02:12:31,349
President Jang...

1622
02:12:45,948 --> 02:12:48,328
I need to see you right now.

1623
02:12:48,328 --> 02:12:49,628
Come to my office.

1624
02:12:49,628 --> 02:12:51,868
I'm not interested in seeing you.

1625
02:12:51,868 --> 02:12:53,198
I'm hanging up.

1626
02:12:59,609 --> 02:13:01,059
Take me to Kim Jiwan's apartment.

1627
02:13:31,719 --> 02:13:33,628
I just

1628
02:13:33,628 --> 02:13:37,038
met with Taehu Industry's company lawyer.

1629
02:13:39,029 --> 02:13:40,809
Then you must've heard everything.

1630
02:13:40,809 --> 02:13:42,239
Yes.

1631
02:13:44,458 --> 02:13:49,088
You mean you heard about Sangjun?

1632
02:13:50,009 --> 02:13:53,189
Your family's become quite crafty.

1633
02:13:53,189 --> 02:13:54,959
Was it money, or something else?

1634
02:13:54,958 --> 02:13:58,248
How did you make him lie to me like that?

1635
02:13:58,248 --> 02:14:00,688
I remember him as a man of integrity,

1636
02:14:00,689 --> 02:14:02,679
so how did you buy him off?

1637
02:14:05,219 --> 02:14:09,069
You're well-prepared to taint my name.

1638
02:14:09,069 --> 02:14:11,629
Turning Sangjun into a saint

1639
02:14:11,628 --> 02:14:14,019
will make me look dirtier and pettier.

1640
02:14:14,019 --> 02:14:15,458
On top of stealing money, I'd become

1641
02:14:15,458 --> 02:14:19,509
a bastard who betrayed his best friend.

1642
02:14:19,509 --> 02:14:21,548
Is that the plan?

1643
02:14:21,548 --> 02:14:24,099
Telling the world how dirty and petty I am?

1644
02:14:24,099 --> 02:14:26,489
That's what you're afraid of?

1645
02:14:29,929 --> 02:14:32,118
I'm relieved.

1646
02:14:32,118 --> 02:14:35,548
At least you know what you did was wrong.

1647
02:14:39,979 --> 02:14:42,168
Why did you do it?

1648
02:14:44,208 --> 02:14:46,918
You're not that type of person.

1649
02:14:47,729 --> 02:14:50,159
You valued people,

1650
02:14:50,158 --> 02:14:52,728
and you were very understanding.

1651
02:14:54,269 --> 02:14:57,779
So Sangjun, Mother, and I

1652
02:14:57,779 --> 02:15:01,089
trusted you with everything.

1653
02:15:01,088 --> 02:15:03,798
You were upright and kindhearted.

1654
02:15:07,189 --> 02:15:09,269
What happened to you?

1655
02:15:11,368 --> 02:15:15,778
How did you end up here like this,

1656
02:15:15,779 --> 02:15:20,409
doubting Sangjun's intentions, Mr. Jang?

1657
02:15:30,599 --> 02:15:33,288
Find evidence on how Kim Jiwan

1658
02:15:33,288 --> 02:15:34,768
bought that lawyer off.

1659
02:15:34,769 --> 02:15:35,929
Taesu, what if...

1660
02:15:35,929 --> 02:15:37,498
What if, what?

1661
02:15:37,498 --> 02:15:39,358
You think it might be true?

1662
02:15:39,359 --> 02:15:41,279
But if it's true, I'm...

1663
02:15:46,418 --> 02:15:47,998
No.

1664
02:15:47,998 --> 02:15:51,158
I'm sure there's evidence of him lying.

1665
02:15:51,158 --> 02:15:54,338
What do you think Kim Jiwan offered him?

1666
02:15:54,338 --> 02:15:55,149
Wait...

1667
02:15:55,149 --> 02:15:56,689
Wait, this means

1668
02:15:56,689 --> 02:15:59,759
he can buy my people off, too.

1669
02:16:01,179 --> 02:16:03,908
What are you waiting for? Go find it!

1670
02:16:04,918 --> 02:16:06,208
Yes, sir.

1671
02:16:15,918 --> 02:16:18,618
I'm Ha Yeongho of Daehan Daily.

1672
02:16:19,498 --> 02:16:20,559
I'm Kim Jiwan.

1673
02:16:20,559 --> 02:16:21,859
Have a seat.

1674
02:16:26,679 --> 02:16:30,168
I heard the news from a former employee.

1675
02:16:30,168 --> 02:16:32,548
You've been contacting former directors?

1676
02:16:32,549 --> 02:16:34,009
How many people have you met with?

1677
02:16:34,009 --> 02:16:35,619
About twenty.

1678
02:16:36,488 --> 02:16:38,269
And I've been preparing

1679
02:16:38,269 --> 02:16:40,228
the recordings of their accounts.

1680
02:16:40,228 --> 02:16:41,588
I think I can report the story right away

1681
02:16:41,588 --> 02:16:44,349
if I had a copy of those recordings.

1682
02:16:44,349 --> 02:16:46,699
Can you give me a copy?

1683
02:16:46,699 --> 02:16:47,959
Of course.

1684
02:16:47,959 --> 02:16:50,299
I'll call you once I'm done sorting them.

1685
02:17:52,509 --> 02:17:55,109
Can't fall asleep?

1686
02:17:57,629 --> 02:18:00,129
I can't seem to understand Father.

1687
02:18:01,629 --> 02:18:05,088
Why did he try to put someone like

1688
02:18:05,088 --> 02:18:07,728
Jang Taesu in charge of his money?

1689
02:18:09,558 --> 02:18:10,768
That was so foolish.

1690
02:18:10,769 --> 02:18:12,148
Jiwan.

1691
02:18:14,289 --> 02:18:16,929
Don't blame your father.

1692
02:18:17,488 --> 02:18:20,958
Back then, the only person he could trust

1693
02:18:20,959 --> 02:18:23,499
was Mr. Jang Taesu.

1694
02:18:24,648 --> 02:18:27,929
With his health deteriorating,

1695
02:18:27,929 --> 02:18:31,519
your father was afraid of the future.

1696
02:18:32,179 --> 02:18:34,908
And he thought

1697
02:18:34,908 --> 02:18:39,478
Mr. Jang Taesu could look after us.

1698
02:18:39,478 --> 02:18:41,648
He was wrong.

1699
02:18:42,439 --> 02:18:44,488
He trusted the man

1700
02:18:44,488 --> 02:18:47,128
who stole all his money the day he died.

1701
02:18:47,129 --> 02:18:49,989
If it were me,

1702
02:18:49,988 --> 02:18:51,738
I would've trusted Mr. Jang Taesu, too.

1703
02:18:53,119 --> 02:18:56,009
He was a different man

1704
02:18:56,009 --> 02:18:58,218
from who he is now.

1705
02:18:58,218 --> 02:19:00,268
And that's why I can't forgive him.

1706
02:19:00,269 --> 02:19:02,349
As a human being,

1707
02:19:02,349 --> 02:19:03,488
you cannot betray someone

1708
02:19:03,488 --> 02:19:05,308
who trusts you.

1709
02:20:50,168 --> 02:20:51,939
Hyeondo.

1710
02:20:54,179 --> 02:20:58,599
Why not resign from your father's company?

1711
02:21:02,568 --> 02:21:06,948
I'll look into another job for you.

1712
02:21:10,679 --> 02:21:12,558
I should go to work.

1713
02:21:23,449 --> 02:21:25,699
Sugyeong came to see you?

1714
02:21:25,699 --> 02:21:29,119
She really begged for your forgiveness?

1715
02:21:30,228 --> 02:21:33,558
Sugyeong looked really bad.

1716
02:21:34,668 --> 02:21:36,929
I think she's miserable.

1717
02:21:36,929 --> 02:21:38,478
She should be.

1718
02:21:38,478 --> 02:21:39,929
Of course.

1719
02:21:39,929 --> 02:21:43,039
If she's not, she's not human.

1720
02:21:43,728 --> 02:21:47,358
Wait, but why do you sound so sad?

1721
02:21:47,359 --> 02:21:48,929
What?

1722
02:21:49,679 --> 02:21:53,058
Seeing her miserable made you soft?

1723
02:21:53,058 --> 02:21:55,408
Oh, my.

1724
02:21:55,408 --> 02:21:57,658
You sure are a saint.

1725
02:21:58,308 --> 02:22:00,158
She's going through a rough time after

1726
02:22:00,158 --> 02:22:03,418
a life of luxury, and you feel sorry?

1727
02:22:03,418 --> 02:22:06,679
You're the one I feel sorry for.

1728
02:22:07,728 --> 02:22:13,259
It seems as though Hyeondo is sick.

1729
02:22:13,259 --> 02:22:15,058
He's at the hospital.

1730
02:22:15,058 --> 02:22:17,078
Hyeondo?

1731
02:22:17,078 --> 02:22:18,699
How could a child be healthy

1732
02:22:18,699 --> 02:22:21,029
when his parents have no morals?

1733
02:22:21,029 --> 02:22:24,799
Karma passes down to children.

1734
02:22:27,588 --> 02:22:31,298
Thank you for helping me in Russia.

1735
02:22:31,918 --> 02:22:33,429
How could I say no to you?

1736
02:22:33,429 --> 02:22:35,738
I had to do it.

1737
02:22:35,738 --> 02:22:37,128
So I was thinking,

1738
02:22:37,129 --> 02:22:39,059
I heard you might end up

1739
02:22:39,058 --> 02:22:41,868
taking over the company.

1740
02:22:41,869 --> 02:22:44,139
There's an idea

1741
02:22:44,138 --> 02:22:47,658
I've been developing for five years,

1742
02:22:47,658 --> 02:22:50,478
and going to Russia gave me

1743
02:22:50,478 --> 02:22:52,548
reaffirmation on my idea.

1744
02:22:52,549 --> 02:22:54,969
So I was wondering

1745
02:22:54,968 --> 02:22:58,218
if you could give me a chance

1746
02:22:58,218 --> 02:23:00,668
to present that idea to you.

1747
02:23:04,549 --> 02:23:06,249
Please don't joke around with me.

1748
02:23:06,939 --> 02:23:08,398
I'm not...

1749
02:23:08,398 --> 02:23:12,078
Yes, I know I was hard on you,

1750
02:23:12,078 --> 02:23:14,158
and made your life difficult.

1751
02:23:14,158 --> 02:23:18,099
I saw talent when I saw you, so,

1752
02:23:18,099 --> 02:23:20,129
yes, like in Chinese novels,

1753
02:23:20,129 --> 02:23:21,679
in order to make someone a hero,

1754
02:23:21,679 --> 02:23:23,759
people around him

1755
02:23:23,759 --> 02:23:26,549
create hardships for him.

1756
02:23:26,549 --> 02:23:28,499
All Chinese heroes are like that.

1757
02:23:28,498 --> 02:23:30,628
They prevail over and over again,

1758
02:23:30,629 --> 02:23:31,619
and accomplish...

1759
02:23:31,619 --> 02:23:33,219
It's okay.

1760
02:23:33,218 --> 02:23:34,148
No, I...

1761
02:23:34,148 --> 02:23:36,189
I said it's okay!

1762
02:23:36,859 --> 02:23:38,168
Why do you keep bugging me!

1763
02:23:38,168 --> 02:23:39,668
I said it's okay!

1764
02:23:39,668 --> 02:23:41,209
Something great.

1765
02:23:43,558 --> 02:23:44,888
I think you're mistaken.

1766
02:23:44,888 --> 02:23:46,348
It's okay.

1767
02:23:46,349 --> 02:23:48,709
Sorry for cutting you off, but you're...

1768
02:23:49,279 --> 02:23:50,668
No, I'm not mistaken.

1769
02:23:50,668 --> 02:23:52,628
I think you're mistaken.

1770
02:23:52,629 --> 02:23:55,499
It's not like that. Just think about it.

1771
02:23:55,978 --> 02:23:58,808
When you asked me for a favor like that,

1772
02:23:58,808 --> 02:24:02,578
wasn't it because we are close?

1773
02:24:03,619 --> 02:24:05,248
- Yes. / - Right?

1774
02:24:05,248 --> 02:24:10,808
So since we share a special relationship,

1775
02:24:10,808 --> 02:24:11,778
let me present it in a special...

1776
02:24:11,779 --> 02:24:12,889
Jiwan.

1777
02:24:13,299 --> 02:24:14,369
Hi, Eunsu.

1778
02:24:14,369 --> 02:24:15,699
Ms. Han Eunsu!

1779
02:24:15,699 --> 02:24:17,799
Oh? Hello.

1780
02:24:17,799 --> 02:24:19,289
What are you doing here?

1781
02:24:21,519 --> 02:24:23,088
Huh?

1782
02:24:25,158 --> 02:24:27,179
She's my little sister.

1783
02:24:28,179 --> 02:24:29,699
Your real sister?

1784
02:24:29,699 --> 02:24:30,819
Yes.

1785
02:24:31,138 --> 02:24:35,768
But her last name's Han, and yours is Kim.

1786
02:24:37,408 --> 02:24:38,958
Jiwan, Eunsu.

1787
02:24:38,959 --> 02:24:40,849
- Hi, Aunt. / - Hi.

1788
02:24:41,439 --> 02:24:42,449
Remember?

1789
02:24:42,449 --> 02:24:45,139
This is Mr. Yun, my former team leader.

1790
02:24:45,138 --> 02:24:46,528
- Hello. / - She's my aunt.

1791
02:24:46,529 --> 02:24:47,488
Oh, Aunt.

1792
02:24:47,488 --> 02:24:51,029
Hello, I am Yun Oyong.

1793
02:24:52,549 --> 02:24:53,599
Hi.

1794
02:24:53,599 --> 02:24:56,849
I'm Park Haengsuk.

1795
02:24:56,849 --> 02:24:58,068
Excuse me?

1796
02:24:58,068 --> 02:24:59,908
Park...

1797
02:24:59,908 --> 02:25:03,689
You're his aunt, but your last name is Park?

1798
02:25:05,418 --> 02:25:10,738
Kim, Han and Park.

1799
02:25:10,738 --> 02:25:13,359
A family with different last names?

1800
02:25:18,699 --> 02:25:21,328
What happened?

1801
02:25:21,328 --> 02:25:22,908
Why is that office empty?

1802
02:25:22,908 --> 02:25:25,628
All the desks and chairs are gone.

1803
02:25:25,629 --> 02:25:27,229
Oh, that office?

1804
02:25:27,228 --> 02:25:28,728
They moved out.

1805
02:25:28,728 --> 02:25:30,478
They moved out?

1806
02:25:30,478 --> 02:25:32,658
Where did they go?

1807
02:25:32,658 --> 02:25:34,378
Where are my daughter and husband?

1808
02:25:34,379 --> 02:25:39,379
I heard they're pitching a tent at a farm.

1809
02:25:42,179 --> 02:25:43,728
A, a tent?

1810
02:25:50,588 --> 02:25:51,709
Oh,

1811
02:25:51,709 --> 02:25:55,199
I think we need to get a phone line fast.

1812
02:25:55,199 --> 02:25:56,479
When is the phone guy coming?

1813
02:25:56,478 --> 02:25:58,338
He'll be here at 3.

1814
02:25:58,338 --> 02:26:00,328
Where should the line go?

1815
02:26:00,328 --> 02:26:01,838
I'll find a spot.

1816
02:26:02,218 --> 02:26:03,528
I'll take that, Yeongju.

1817
02:26:10,619 --> 02:26:12,668
You shouldn't bite off more than you can chew,

1818
02:26:12,668 --> 02:26:14,298
and mingle with your own kind!

1819
02:26:14,299 --> 02:26:17,499
You're suffering because of Jiwan!

1820
02:26:17,498 --> 02:26:19,398
It's my fault for signing a contract

1821
02:26:19,398 --> 02:26:21,968
that says the owner can evict us at any time.

1822
02:26:21,968 --> 02:26:23,678
How dare you side with Jiwan!

1823
02:26:23,679 --> 02:26:25,648
I'm going to get him for this!

1824
02:26:26,779 --> 02:26:27,889
Honey, Mi...

1825
02:26:31,248 --> 02:26:32,798
What did Mom say?

1826
02:26:34,539 --> 02:26:37,439
She's going to get Jiwan.

1827
02:26:37,439 --> 02:26:38,748
What?

1828
02:26:39,529 --> 02:26:40,469
Seriously...

1829
02:26:40,468 --> 02:26:41,798
Let's hurry up.

1830
02:26:45,759 --> 02:26:47,248
Jiwan, you!

1831
02:26:47,488 --> 02:26:48,359
Hello.

1832
02:26:48,359 --> 02:26:49,658
Just a second.

1833
02:26:50,099 --> 02:26:51,369
Hello.

1834
02:26:52,148 --> 02:26:54,908
It's an important meeting. This way.

1835
02:26:55,359 --> 02:26:57,429
Everything looks great.

1836
02:26:57,429 --> 02:27:01,129
I can see, now that I'm here.

1837
02:27:01,129 --> 02:27:04,759
You put up a makeshift office near the farm.

1838
02:27:04,759 --> 02:27:08,638
It shows your concern for quality control.

1839
02:27:08,638 --> 02:27:09,929
I just need to sign here, yes?

1840
02:27:09,929 --> 02:27:11,328
Yes.

1841
02:27:16,808 --> 02:27:17,978
Thank you.

1842
02:27:17,978 --> 02:27:18,948
I hope this works out great.

1843
02:27:18,949 --> 02:27:19,979
Thank you.

1844
02:27:25,638 --> 02:27:26,698
Goodbye.

1845
02:27:26,699 --> 02:27:28,979
That guy

1846
02:27:28,978 --> 02:27:30,679
is great at many things.

1847
02:27:30,679 --> 02:27:32,529
He's amazing.

1848
02:27:32,529 --> 02:27:34,949
He performs better under pressure.

1849
02:27:36,328 --> 02:27:38,838
Ms. Lee, it must've been hard to find us.

1850
02:27:38,838 --> 02:27:40,269
And it's such a hot day.

1851
02:27:40,269 --> 02:27:42,849
Let me get you something cool to drink.

1852
02:27:42,849 --> 02:27:44,168
Mr. Jang.

1853
02:27:50,259 --> 02:27:52,269
This is worth $30,000.

1854
02:27:56,799 --> 02:28:00,169
Dad, why did you say it was Jiwan's fault?

1855
02:28:00,168 --> 02:28:01,959
Hey, cut me some slack.

1856
02:28:01,959 --> 02:28:03,369
I was caught off guard.

1857
02:28:03,369 --> 02:28:04,699
It slipped out.

1858
02:28:04,699 --> 02:28:05,989
I can't believe you.

1859
02:28:06,289 --> 02:28:09,139
It's cooked. Yes, have some.

1860
02:28:10,418 --> 02:28:11,539
Director, you're here.

1861
02:28:11,539 --> 02:28:12,949
- Mr. Kang, you're here. / - Honey.

1862
02:28:12,949 --> 02:28:14,309
Yes.

1863
02:28:15,509 --> 02:28:16,799
What are you doing here?

1864
02:28:17,349 --> 02:28:18,748
What do you think?

1865
02:28:18,748 --> 02:28:20,568
They are working so hard on a hot day,

1866
02:28:20,568 --> 02:28:22,088
so I bought them Korean pork

1867
02:28:22,088 --> 02:28:24,689
to help them restore some energy.

1868
02:28:24,689 --> 02:28:27,568
Domestic is always the best.

1869
02:28:27,568 --> 02:28:29,958
Of course. You're a wise man.

1870
02:28:31,498 --> 02:28:34,158
Honey, don't just stand there. Come and sit.

1871
02:28:34,158 --> 02:28:35,769
- Come here. / - Yeongju, come and sit down.

1872
02:28:35,769 --> 02:28:37,238
Yes, Yeongju, come and eat.

1873
02:28:37,238 --> 02:28:38,338
Let me go get some more lettuce.

1874
02:28:38,338 --> 02:28:39,548
Okay.

1875
02:28:45,769 --> 02:28:46,978
Wait,

1876
02:28:46,978 --> 02:28:49,138
weren't you mad at Jiwan?

1877
02:28:49,138 --> 02:28:50,488
What's going on?

1878
02:28:50,488 --> 02:28:51,769
Oh, I can't believe you.

1879
02:28:51,769 --> 02:28:53,828
When? People might actually believe that.

1880
02:28:53,828 --> 02:28:55,929
Why would I talk badly about Jiwan?

1881
02:28:55,929 --> 02:28:59,398
When I came here, Jiwan was doing great,

1882
02:28:59,398 --> 02:29:02,189
so I bought him Korean pork,

1883
02:29:02,189 --> 02:29:04,129
to help him restore energy.

1884
02:29:04,129 --> 02:29:06,588
Why are you just sitting there?

1885
02:29:06,588 --> 02:29:08,369
Go and help wash the lettuce.

1886
02:29:08,369 --> 02:29:09,559
Go help Jiwan.

1887
02:29:10,009 --> 02:29:11,478
Okay.

1888
02:29:13,129 --> 02:29:16,909
I'm a great judge of character.

1889
02:29:16,908 --> 02:29:20,718
Mom, just have one spoonful.

1890
02:29:20,718 --> 02:29:21,588
Say ah.

1891
02:29:21,588 --> 02:29:24,568
I don't want any chicken porridge.

1892
02:29:24,568 --> 02:29:27,498
It's not just chicken. It has ginseng, too.

1893
02:29:27,498 --> 02:29:29,998
You need to eat warm food in the summer,

1894
02:29:29,998 --> 02:29:32,668
so you can restore energy, okay?

1895
02:29:32,668 --> 02:29:34,888
Just have one spoonful.

1896
02:29:34,888 --> 02:29:36,018
Say ah.

1897
02:29:41,949 --> 02:29:43,869
See?

1898
02:29:43,869 --> 02:29:46,759
You're upset because of what you said.

1899
02:29:46,759 --> 02:29:49,179
I didn't say anything wrong.

1900
02:29:49,179 --> 02:29:52,539
Imagine how Seonhui and Eunsu must feel.

1901
02:29:52,539 --> 02:29:55,479
You're worried about Eunsu, aren't you?

1902
02:29:57,189 --> 02:29:58,859
I hope she gets over Hyeondo,

1903
02:29:58,859 --> 02:30:01,309
and meets someone nice.

1904
02:30:02,269 --> 02:30:04,588
I'm sure she will.

1905
02:30:05,179 --> 02:30:07,849
Couples form and break up all the time.

1906
02:30:09,978 --> 02:30:13,048
Jiwan doesn't have a girlfriend?

1907
02:30:13,049 --> 02:30:16,299
Jiwan has no time for that.

1908
02:30:18,439 --> 02:30:19,648
This?

1909
02:30:22,949 --> 02:30:24,449
You see,

1910
02:30:24,929 --> 02:30:28,558
here are the size and unit.

1911
02:30:31,818 --> 02:30:33,798
Hi.

1912
02:30:36,109 --> 02:30:39,318
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

1913
02:30:39,619 --> 02:30:41,769
Don't say that. I'm glad you're here.

1914
02:30:41,769 --> 02:30:43,449
But why are you here?

1915
02:30:45,888 --> 02:30:48,328
Oh, I'm stuffed.

1916
02:30:48,328 --> 02:30:52,208
You must really love spicy chicken stew.

1917
02:30:52,209 --> 02:30:53,689
You ate a lot of it.

1918
02:30:53,689 --> 02:30:55,189
Because it was delicious.

1919
02:30:58,148 --> 02:31:01,278
It's late, so take Yeongju home.

1920
02:31:01,279 --> 02:31:03,399
It's okay. I can go home alone.

1921
02:31:03,828 --> 02:31:04,748
Don't say that.

1922
02:31:04,748 --> 02:31:07,029
It's late. What if you get kidnapped?

1923
02:31:07,029 --> 02:31:08,129
Take her home.

1924
02:31:08,129 --> 02:31:09,639
No, that's not going to happen.

1925
02:31:09,638 --> 02:31:11,198
Don't say that. Just go.

1926
02:31:11,199 --> 02:31:12,769
What are you two doing?

1927
02:31:12,769 --> 02:31:14,168
Let's go. I'll walk you home.

1928
02:31:14,168 --> 02:31:16,078
- What? / - Go home, and go to bed.

1929
02:31:16,078 --> 02:31:17,359
- Let's go, Yeongju. / - Bye.

1930
02:31:17,359 --> 02:31:18,318
Okay.

1931
02:31:18,318 --> 02:31:19,679
- Bye. / - Goodnight.

1932
02:31:31,588 --> 02:31:33,718
Are those two dating?

1933
02:31:34,408 --> 02:31:36,529
They're not together yet,

1934
02:31:36,529 --> 02:31:39,449
but they are testing the waters.

1935
02:31:41,269 --> 02:31:43,949
It's frustrating to watch them.

1936
02:31:43,949 --> 02:31:45,578
Yeongju...

1937
02:31:46,308 --> 02:31:47,738
She's nice.

1938
02:31:47,738 --> 02:31:49,078
She is.

1939
02:31:49,078 --> 02:31:51,269
She's pretty and pleasant.

1940
02:31:51,269 --> 02:31:54,519
And she's a teacher.

1941
02:31:54,519 --> 02:31:55,668
Don't you think they look good together?

1942
02:31:55,668 --> 02:31:57,359
Yes, they do.

1943
02:32:07,808 --> 02:32:09,028
(Unique Spicy Chicken Stew)

1944
02:32:33,379 --> 02:32:35,909
Ms. Kang Yeongju, what's all this?

1945
02:32:35,908 --> 02:32:37,769
Why are you cooking all of a sudden?

1946
02:32:39,459 --> 02:32:41,039
I'm just practicing.

1947
02:32:41,449 --> 02:32:42,989
Practicing?

1948
02:32:46,638 --> 02:32:48,808
Oh, I get it.

1949
02:32:48,808 --> 02:32:49,838
Girl...

1950
02:32:49,838 --> 02:32:53,228
You have a good eye.

1951
02:32:53,228 --> 02:32:54,038
What do you mean?

1952
02:32:54,039 --> 02:32:55,918
Jiwan.

1953
02:32:55,918 --> 02:32:57,599
Who cares about education?

1954
02:32:57,599 --> 02:33:01,099
To me, money trumps everything.

1955
02:33:01,099 --> 02:33:04,099
Stop getting ahead of yourself.

1956
02:33:06,619 --> 02:33:08,459
Seonhui is a decent mother-in-law.

1957
02:33:08,459 --> 02:33:10,739
Eunsu is easy.

1958
02:33:10,738 --> 02:33:14,168
The grandmother-in-law will become forgetful.

1959
02:33:14,779 --> 02:33:18,719
Haengsuk. She's the one to watch out for.

1960
02:33:18,718 --> 02:33:20,608
I'm sick of your marriage talk.

1961
02:33:20,609 --> 02:33:21,969
I told you it's not like that.

1962
02:33:21,968 --> 02:33:22,838
Just leave me alone.

1963
02:33:22,838 --> 02:33:25,728
How could I leave you alone?

1964
02:33:25,728 --> 02:33:27,378
You won't go on blind dates,

1965
02:33:27,379 --> 02:33:29,709
but you can't even make Jiwan yours.

1966
02:33:30,759 --> 02:33:32,248
If it were me in the old days,

1967
02:33:32,248 --> 02:33:34,168
I would've already...

1968
02:33:34,918 --> 02:33:36,638
What's the use of giving you my looks?

1969
02:33:36,638 --> 02:33:38,288
Just look at yourself.

1970
02:33:38,289 --> 02:33:41,369
You're dressed like a tomboy,

1971
02:33:41,369 --> 02:33:43,248
and you haven't taken a shower.

1972
02:33:43,248 --> 02:33:46,199
You need to make yourself look pretty!

1973
02:33:46,199 --> 02:33:48,889
Practicing cooking won't help you at all.

1974
02:33:48,888 --> 02:33:51,388
If a girl is pretty, nothing else matters.

1975
02:33:51,388 --> 02:33:52,858
You have to look pretty!

1976
02:33:52,859 --> 02:33:54,719
What good will cooking do for you?

1977
02:33:54,718 --> 02:33:56,088
Besides your pretty face,

1978
02:33:56,088 --> 02:33:58,838
you got nothing from me!

1979
02:33:58,838 --> 02:34:01,148
What do you mean? Like this?

1980
02:34:04,109 --> 02:34:05,279
Oh, you're impossible.

1981
02:34:05,279 --> 02:34:07,729
You're my daughter, but you're impossible!

1982
02:34:07,728 --> 02:34:10,599
Be more like Oh Minja! Like me!

1983
02:34:13,179 --> 02:34:14,248
Minja.

1984
02:34:14,248 --> 02:34:15,168
Oh!

1985
02:34:15,168 --> 02:34:16,138
Ms. Lee!

1986
02:34:16,138 --> 02:34:17,188
What are you doing here?

1987
02:34:17,189 --> 02:34:20,488
I need a new pillow for my neck pain.

1988
02:34:20,488 --> 02:34:21,978
What about you?

1989
02:34:22,619 --> 02:34:25,469
Yeongju's been complaining about neck pain, too.

1990
02:34:26,759 --> 02:34:28,039
Well,

1991
02:34:28,039 --> 02:34:31,649
is Yeongju still going on blind dates?

1992
02:34:33,129 --> 02:34:34,459
I've given up on that.

1993
02:34:34,459 --> 02:34:35,809
How they feel about each other is important,

1994
02:34:35,808 --> 02:34:37,538
not their background.

1995
02:34:37,988 --> 02:34:40,798
You're right!

1996
02:34:40,799 --> 02:34:45,979
But I heard you hold education very high.

1997
02:34:46,859 --> 02:34:50,149
If they're in love, education doesn't matter.

1998
02:34:50,148 --> 02:34:53,189
As long as he's hard-working, it's fine.

1999
02:34:53,929 --> 02:34:59,049
But isn't a small family better?

2000
02:34:59,879 --> 02:35:03,219
I would prefer a small family,

2001
02:35:03,218 --> 02:35:04,618
but these days, as complicated as it is,

2002
02:35:04,619 --> 02:35:07,909
people don't live with married children.

2003
02:35:07,908 --> 02:35:10,328
- You mean live separately? / - Yes.

2004
02:35:11,468 --> 02:35:13,028
But that's...

2005
02:35:13,029 --> 02:35:14,869
Well...

2006
02:35:14,869 --> 02:35:17,239
Old people don't live forever.

2007
02:35:17,238 --> 02:35:19,939
And I'm dying to have a great-grandchild.

2008
02:35:20,468 --> 02:35:22,988
I'm not going to let my daughter

2009
02:35:22,988 --> 02:35:24,798
date anyone with a large family.

2010
02:35:24,799 --> 02:35:27,209
What if she gets stuck with them?

2011
02:35:27,209 --> 02:35:29,029
That won't be good.

2012
02:35:30,658 --> 02:35:33,838
Yes, getting stuck is the key.

2013
02:35:34,179 --> 02:35:35,949
As long as they live separately,

2014
02:35:35,949 --> 02:35:38,519
you don't mind a big family?

2015
02:35:38,519 --> 02:35:40,068
Of course not.

2016
02:35:40,068 --> 02:35:42,368
As long as they are in love.

2017
02:35:43,248 --> 02:35:44,138
Why do you ask?

2018
02:35:44,138 --> 02:35:47,929
You have someone in mind?

2019
02:35:47,929 --> 02:35:49,379
Of course.

2020
02:35:51,199 --> 02:35:53,359
- You do? / - Yes.

2021
02:36:04,529 --> 02:36:07,299
Hello, I'm Ha Yeongho from Daehan Daily.

2022
02:36:07,299 --> 02:36:11,059
Someone tipped me off about Taehu Industry.

2023
02:36:11,058 --> 02:36:14,099
You drove Taehu Industry into bankruptcy,

2024
02:36:14,099 --> 02:36:17,308
and stole millions in funds. Is that true?

2025
02:36:17,308 --> 02:36:18,888
There are protocols for reporters...

2026
02:36:18,888 --> 02:36:20,478
Your former employee Lee Seokjin, and

2027
02:36:20,478 --> 02:36:23,198
former directors will be giving statements!

2028
02:36:23,199 --> 02:36:24,588
Tell me if it's true,

2029
02:36:24,588 --> 02:36:26,838
or if it's slander!

2030
02:36:26,838 --> 02:36:29,748
President Jang!

2031
02:36:29,748 --> 02:36:30,869
Please leave.

2032
02:36:34,179 --> 02:36:36,209
Refuse all interviews.

2033
02:36:36,828 --> 02:36:38,369
It wasn't Kim Jiwan.

2034
02:36:39,259 --> 02:36:41,699
Don't jump the gun, or get them involved.

2035
02:36:41,699 --> 02:36:43,739
I'm sure the reporter heard a rumor.

2036
02:36:45,609 --> 02:36:46,838
If he had all the evidence,

2037
02:36:46,838 --> 02:36:48,959
he would've written about it already.

2038
02:36:49,718 --> 02:36:52,208
I'm coming in, so make sure no one talks.

2039
02:36:52,209 --> 02:36:55,559
I told you to find him, by any means!

2040
02:36:55,558 --> 02:36:56,398
What are you doing?

2041
02:36:56,398 --> 02:36:58,228
Is it that you can't or won't?

2042
02:37:00,588 --> 02:37:02,308
Seokjin was

2043
02:37:02,308 --> 02:37:05,048
with us from the birth of Taehu Industry,

2044
02:37:05,049 --> 02:37:07,049
and is still with us today.

2045
02:37:08,129 --> 02:37:11,338
Dongjin still calls us to congratulate us

2046
02:37:11,338 --> 02:37:13,748
whenever we reach a new milestone.

2047
02:37:15,138 --> 02:37:18,998
Hyeokju practically lived with us

2048
02:37:18,998 --> 02:37:20,679
at the factory.

2049
02:37:21,799 --> 02:37:24,259
So how could I

2050
02:37:24,259 --> 02:37:27,668
dig into their past, and make threats?

2051
02:37:28,648 --> 02:37:30,179
Taesu!

2052
02:37:33,609 --> 02:37:36,139
You've been paid off, too?

2053
02:37:38,599 --> 02:37:41,689
I know you met with Seokjin.

2054
02:37:41,689 --> 02:37:43,869
I wasn't sure.

2055
02:37:44,359 --> 02:37:45,679
So, what did you get from them?

2056
02:37:45,679 --> 02:37:48,609
How much did they pay you!

2057
02:37:49,238 --> 02:37:50,628
Taesu...

2058
02:37:50,629 --> 02:37:51,879
Get out.

2059
02:37:51,879 --> 02:37:52,859
You're fired!

2060
02:37:52,859 --> 02:37:54,229
Get lost!

2061
02:38:56,379 --> 02:38:58,029
Hyeondo,

2062
02:38:58,759 --> 02:39:01,488
I once told your father

2063
02:39:01,488 --> 02:39:03,779
to watch his back because of you.

2064
02:39:06,388 --> 02:39:08,768
And he said to me,

2065
02:39:10,429 --> 02:39:12,488
even if you betrayed him, that was okay.

2066
02:39:13,689 --> 02:39:15,668
Because you're his son.

2067
02:39:19,779 --> 02:39:21,799
Look after Taesu.

2068
02:39:24,019 --> 02:39:26,519
I can't seem to do it anymore.

2069
02:40:20,408 --> 02:40:23,759
Is this Mr. Han Yeongho of Daehan Daily?

2070
02:40:23,759 --> 02:40:25,629
This is Kim Jiwan.

2071
02:40:26,859 --> 02:40:30,248
Can we have that interview tomorrow?

2072
02:40:37,318 --> 02:40:38,939
Yes, Mr. Han.

2073
02:40:40,199 --> 02:40:41,879
I'm on my way.

2074
02:41:40,558 --> 02:41:42,118
Your father was going to

2075
02:41:43,328 --> 02:41:46,918
hand over his company to my father?

2076
02:41:50,199 --> 02:41:52,699
I couldn't understand him at first,

2077
02:41:54,978 --> 02:41:57,978
but now that I think about it,

2078
02:41:57,978 --> 02:41:59,908
I can understand him a little bit.

2079
02:42:13,459 --> 02:42:15,579
This is all the evidence I've collected.

2080
02:42:19,939 --> 02:42:21,828
Why are you giving them to me?

2081
02:42:26,968 --> 02:42:28,988
Why did you

2082
02:42:28,988 --> 02:42:31,148
give me that notebook?

2083
02:43:04,549 --> 02:43:05,869
Have you had a lot to drink?

2084
02:43:07,199 --> 02:43:10,719
You asked me here, so why are you late?

2085
02:43:15,338 --> 02:43:17,269
I met Jiwan.

2086
02:43:20,699 --> 02:43:22,979
Uncle Sangjun

2087
02:43:24,658 --> 02:43:27,968
was going to give you all his money?

2088
02:43:28,718 --> 02:43:30,628
That's a lie.

2089
02:43:31,398 --> 02:43:33,318
Right?

2090
02:43:36,779 --> 02:43:39,639
Who would actually do that?

2091
02:43:39,638 --> 02:43:41,968
Why would he give you his company

2092
02:43:41,968 --> 02:43:44,588
when he has a son and a family?

2093
02:43:44,588 --> 02:43:46,509
That's ridiculous.

2094
02:43:47,168 --> 02:43:48,988
You were just a friend.

2095
02:43:50,109 --> 02:43:51,899
Not his blood.

2096
02:43:55,929 --> 02:43:57,838
Don't you agree?

2097
02:43:59,478 --> 02:44:01,058
Yes.

2098
02:44:01,658 --> 02:44:03,638
I'm not his blood.

2099
02:44:06,529 --> 02:44:08,838
But,

2100
02:44:09,668 --> 02:44:12,418
even though I wasn't his blood,

2101
02:44:12,418 --> 02:44:16,058
Sangjun might have actually really

2102
02:44:16,058 --> 02:44:20,208
wanted to give me his company.

2103
02:44:23,199 --> 02:44:26,769
But why...

2104
02:44:26,769 --> 02:44:29,289
How could he trust me so much?

2105
02:45:06,759 --> 02:45:07,998
Jiwan.

2106
02:45:11,398 --> 02:45:14,738
Do you

2107
02:45:14,738 --> 02:45:17,618
remember Dad?

2108
02:45:20,648 --> 02:45:22,509
A little bit.

2109
02:45:25,619 --> 02:45:31,359
What kind of person was he?

2110
02:45:34,238 --> 02:45:37,429
He smiled at me whenever he saw me.

2111
02:45:44,978 --> 02:45:47,538
Why did

2112
02:45:49,408 --> 02:45:53,718
Dad trust a man like him?

2113
02:45:55,908 --> 02:45:58,509
He was so foolish.

2114
02:46:02,978 --> 02:46:05,958
You think so, too, don't you?

2115
02:47:16,658 --> 02:47:18,078
How have you been?

2116
02:47:30,959 --> 02:47:33,029
Don't turn bad.

2117
02:47:35,498 --> 02:47:38,168
That's not who you are, Hyeondo.

2118
02:47:49,099 --> 02:47:50,709
I should go.

2119
02:48:30,718 --> 02:48:31,958
The Korean Businessmen's Association

2120
02:48:31,959 --> 02:48:35,779
recommended you as a next chairperson.

2121
02:48:36,238 --> 02:48:40,168
You're to give an acceptance speech.

2122
02:48:41,619 --> 02:48:42,859
Okay.

2123
02:48:42,859 --> 02:48:44,338
I got it.

2124
02:48:44,918 --> 02:48:46,369
Oh, and

2125
02:48:46,369 --> 02:48:48,469
call my wife's lawyer,

2126
02:48:48,468 --> 02:48:50,488
and have him visit me here.

2127
02:48:50,488 --> 02:48:51,929
Yes, sir.

2128
02:49:00,019 --> 02:49:01,969
President Jang wants to see you

2129
02:49:01,968 --> 02:49:03,848
before going to court.

2130
02:49:05,148 --> 02:49:06,778
What is it about?

2131
02:49:06,779 --> 02:49:09,369
He said he will tell you in person.

2132
02:50:02,859 --> 02:50:06,059
You like the coffee here, don't you?

2133
02:50:06,058 --> 02:50:08,988
You didn't call me here for coffee.

2134
02:50:08,988 --> 02:50:10,988
What is this about?

2135
02:50:12,039 --> 02:50:14,248
I called you over to have a cup of coffee.

2136
02:50:15,099 --> 02:50:16,719
Excuse me.

2137
02:50:38,498 --> 02:50:41,738
I came because you like it here,

2138
02:50:41,738 --> 02:50:43,359
but to me, the company

2139
02:50:43,359 --> 02:50:46,509
vending machine coffee's the best.

2140
02:50:47,728 --> 02:50:51,788
You've always had cheap taste.

2141
02:50:51,789 --> 02:50:53,129
What?

2142
02:50:53,129 --> 02:50:55,309
You hate me because of my cheap taste?

2143
02:50:55,879 --> 02:50:58,259
No,

2144
02:50:58,259 --> 02:51:00,488
it was easy for me.

2145
02:51:03,179 --> 02:51:04,859
Successful men

2146
02:51:04,859 --> 02:51:08,408
always get a mistress first.

2147
02:51:08,408 --> 02:51:10,708
But

2148
02:51:10,709 --> 02:51:13,769
you have simple taste in everything.

2149
02:51:13,769 --> 02:51:15,918
Vending machine coffee, soju,

2150
02:51:15,918 --> 02:51:17,959
and roasted rice tea after meals.

2151
02:51:19,238 --> 02:51:21,828
And with women, only Jeong Sugyeong.

2152
02:51:23,588 --> 02:51:26,779
I did have simple taste,

2153
02:51:26,779 --> 02:51:29,379
but it was never cheap.

2154
02:51:32,269 --> 02:51:37,168
I loved having you

2155
02:51:37,168 --> 02:51:38,959
as my husband.

2156
02:51:41,789 --> 02:51:45,129
I respected you

2157
02:51:45,129 --> 02:51:49,949
more than anyone.

2158
02:51:54,799 --> 02:51:57,869
If you are willing to change,

2159
02:51:57,869 --> 02:52:00,799
nothing will change between us.

2160
02:52:08,818 --> 02:52:13,478
Will Jeong Sugyeong still love Jang Taesu

2161
02:52:13,478 --> 02:52:16,748
without his money and honor?

2162
02:52:20,519 --> 02:52:23,879
That's why it can't be, Ms. Jeong.

2163
02:52:34,779 --> 02:52:36,369
This is the divorce papers.

2164
02:52:36,369 --> 02:52:38,389
I already signed it,

2165
02:52:38,388 --> 02:52:40,418
so you take care of the rest.

2166
02:54:23,949 --> 02:54:27,168
Are you sure you want to let this go?

2167
02:54:28,299 --> 02:54:30,789
You won't regret it?

2168
02:54:32,609 --> 02:54:35,039
That was what Father wanted.

2169
02:54:36,279 --> 02:54:38,559
If President Jang

2170
02:54:38,558 --> 02:54:42,429
doesn't change his ways after finding out

2171
02:54:43,328 --> 02:54:46,029
what Father wanted, he'll be more miserable.

2172
02:55:06,349 --> 02:55:09,488
Hello, everyone.

2173
02:55:09,488 --> 02:55:11,998
I'm Jang Taesu from Best Global,

2174
02:55:11,998 --> 02:55:15,439
who recently won Businessman of the Year.

2175
02:55:21,388 --> 02:55:25,288
There are many senior entrepreneurs

2176
02:55:25,289 --> 02:55:27,099
and colleagues who deserve the award,

2177
02:55:27,099 --> 02:55:28,828
so I feel a very big responsibility

2178
02:55:28,828 --> 02:55:31,068
to win this accolade.

2179
02:55:31,509 --> 02:55:36,179
And it's an honor to have the position

2180
02:55:36,179 --> 02:55:39,179
to represent all entrepreneurs.

2181
02:55:40,578 --> 02:55:44,388
Sitting here

2182
02:55:44,388 --> 02:55:46,998
brings back old memories.

2183
02:55:49,769 --> 02:55:55,209
I had a friend.

2184
02:55:55,799 --> 02:55:59,769
He trusted me when I had nothing,

2185
02:55:59,769 --> 02:56:04,349
and helped me get to where I am today.

2186
02:56:04,949 --> 02:56:07,168
He was the president of Taehu Industry

2187
02:56:07,168 --> 02:56:10,269
where Best Global began.

2188

Kim Sangjun.

2189
02:56:17,988 --> 02:56:21,759
That was my friend's name.

2190
02:56:22,379 --> 02:56:25,699
He was naively trusting,

2191
02:56:25,699 --> 02:56:28,179
and honest

2192
02:56:28,179 --> 02:56:31,849
even to a fault.

2193
02:56:33,179 --> 02:56:35,918
I considered his company

2194
02:56:35,918 --> 02:56:39,369
as my own,

2195
02:56:40,689 --> 02:56:43,619
and worked hard.

2196
02:56:51,459 --> 02:56:54,719
But,

2197
02:56:54,718 --> 02:56:58,768
I

2198
02:56:58,769 --> 02:57:01,889
stole...

2199
02:57:14,609 --> 02:57:17,029
All of his money.

2200
02:57:19,929 --> 02:57:21,398
What did he just say?

2201
02:57:39,679 --> 02:57:43,418
Yeongju, summarize this register, please.

2202
02:57:45,369 --> 02:57:46,989
May I help you?

2203
02:57:50,849 --> 02:57:53,039
Mr. Jang Hyeondo.

2204
02:57:53,039 --> 02:57:55,779
How dare you come here!

2205
02:57:56,869 --> 02:57:58,599
Jang Hyeondo?

2206
02:57:59,478 --> 02:58:01,578
You're that guy?

2207
02:58:01,578 --> 02:58:02,918
How dare you show your face here?

2208
02:58:02,918 --> 02:58:04,609
Get out.

2209
02:58:18,009 --> 02:58:20,199
I'm sorry.

2210
02:58:21,429 --> 02:58:24,658
That's all I can say.

2211
02:58:34,808 --> 02:58:36,349
Yes.

2212
02:58:37,238 --> 02:58:42,788
I tricked my trusting friend's family,

2213
02:58:42,789 --> 02:58:46,409
and bought their shares for pennies.

2214
02:58:46,408 --> 02:58:50,788
And I even kicked his family out

2215
02:58:50,789 --> 02:58:53,719
from their house.

2216
02:58:57,808 --> 02:59:00,548
And so I used

2217
02:59:00,549 --> 02:59:04,619
the stolen money,

2218
02:59:06,578 --> 02:59:10,748
and built my own company.

Sangjun

2226
03:01:38,578 --> 03:01:41,468
might have died because of me.

2227

He's giving you what?

2228
03:01:44,648 --> 03:01:45,828
Stocks.

2229
03:01:45,828 --> 03:01:48,968
And he's resigning from his position.

2230
03:01:49,799 --> 03:01:52,759
Why are they so dense,

2231
03:01:52,759 --> 03:01:53,908
when I'm trying to help them?

2232
03:01:53,908 --> 03:01:55,918
They should at least try to

2233
03:01:55,918 --> 03:01:57,269
go on a few dates.

What is it?

2238
03:02:50,158 --> 03:02:52,628
You think with Lee Seokjin and some old

2239

directors, you can turn the tables?

2240
03:02:55,129 --> 03:02:57,069
It's not that simple in the real world.

2241
03:02:59,519 --> 03:03:01,709
Is that your way of doing things?

2242

Betraying a friend that trusts you,

2243

and stealing all of his money?

2244
03:03:08,898 --> 03:03:11,878
Sangjun asked for this, do you know?

2245
03:03:11,879 --> 03:03:13,669
Is that why you wanted my father to die?

2246
03:03:13,668 --> 03:03:16,519
I said he was already dead when I got there!

2247
03:03:19,799 --> 03:03:21,119
Sure.

2248
03:03:23,218 --> 03:03:26,358
Wherever you go and whomever you meet,

2249

keep telling that story.

2250
03:03:29,109 --> 03:03:31,139
Even if

2251
03:03:31,138 --> 03:03:34,448
you made my father die,

2252
03:03:34,449 --> 03:03:36,578
don't ever speak of it.

2253
03:03:36,578 --> 03:03:38,199
Ever.

2254
03:03:39,679 --> 03:03:42,259
If not,

2255
03:03:42,939 --> 03:03:45,719
I would have to feel sorry for my father

2256
03:03:45,718 --> 03:03:48,198
for being too foolish

2257
03:03:48,199 --> 03:03:49,609
to have trusted you so much.

2258
03:03:55,109 --> 03:03:57,199
It was for you.

2259
03:03:59,369 --> 03:04:01,219
For you,

2260
03:04:02,859 --> 03:04:05,389
for an ingrate like you,

2261
03:04:07,679 --> 03:04:09,789
my father did all the work.

2262
03:04:15,519 --> 03:04:18,668
From the beginning, my father prepared

2263
03:04:18,668 --> 03:04:22,238
all the money and paperwork for you.

2264
03:04:23,699 --> 03:04:27,009
Even if you hadn't stolen the money,

2265
03:04:27,009 --> 03:04:30,388
if you just let things run its course,

2266
03:04:30,388 --> 03:04:32,898
you would've eventually gotten all of it.

2267
03:04:36,859 --> 03:04:40,658
I understand that you're an engineer,

2268
03:04:40,658 --> 03:04:42,679
but what about running the company?

2269
03:04:42,679 --> 03:04:45,318
Asking me to manage the money is...

2270
03:04:45,318 --> 03:04:48,599
If you do it, it'll be like I'm doing it.

2271
03:04:48,599 --> 03:04:49,859
Sangjun, still...

2272
03:04:49,859 --> 03:04:51,668
On top of that,

2273
03:04:51,668 --> 03:04:54,599
I don't know if I need to run the company.

2274
03:04:54,599 --> 03:04:55,748
I want to hire someone capable,

2275
03:04:55,748 --> 03:04:57,289
and have him run it the way he wants.

2276
03:04:57,289 --> 03:04:59,049
I can focus on technology development,

2277
03:04:59,049 --> 03:05:01,959
and he can help grow the company.

I don't understand, either.

If he was alive, I'd love to ask him

why he trusted someone like you.

trust his friend with all his money?

You know that better than I do.

2332
03:11:11,359 --> 03:11:14,418
He turned everything into cash,

2333

and invested it into his company.

2334

2350
03:12:11,439 --> 03:12:13,719
how much longer

2351
03:12:13,718 --> 03:12:15,518
my heart will last.

2352
03:12:16,888 --> 03:12:20,868
Without me, what will happen to my mother,

2353
03:12:20,869 --> 03:12:22,379
my wife, and kids?

2354
03:12:24,148 --> 03:12:26,908
Anyone can talk my mother into signing

2355
03:12:26,908 --> 03:12:29,468
any document they want, and my wife

2356
03:12:29,468 --> 03:12:33,528
does not know how to deal with my mother.

2357
03:12:33,529 --> 03:12:38,049
I need someone to be there for my family.

2358
03:12:38,049 --> 03:12:41,419
Money aside, I know Taesu will

2359
03:12:41,418 --> 03:12:44,218
take great care of my family.

2360
03:12:45,439 --> 03:12:49,959
I know what kind of man he is.

2361
03:12:58,599 --> 03:13:01,459
President Jang...

2362
03:13:05,679 --> 03:13:07,849
You,

2363
03:13:07,849 --> 03:13:09,619
you're lying, aren't you?

2364
03:13:09,619 --> 03:13:10,859
How much money did Kim Jiwan give you?

2365
03:13:10,859 --> 03:13:12,549
How much did it take to pay you off?

2366
03:13:12,549 --> 03:13:14,059
President Jang...

2367
03:13:28,658 --> 03:13:31,038
I need to see you right now.

2368
03:13:31,039 --> 03:13:32,338
Come to my office.

2369
03:13:32,338 --> 03:13:34,578
I'm not interested in seeing you.

2370
03:13:34,578 --> 03:13:35,908
I'm hanging up.

2371
03:13:42,318 --> 03:13:43,769
Take me to Kim Jiwan's apartment.

2372
03:14:14,429 --> 03:14:16,338
I just

2373
03:14:16,338 --> 03:14:19,748
met with Taehu Industry's company lawyer.

2374
03:14:21,738 --> 03:14:23,519
Then you must've heard everything.

2375
03:14:23,519 --> 03:14:24,949
Yes.

2376
03:14:27,168 --> 03:14:31,798
You mean you heard about Sangjun?

2377
03:14:32,718 --> 03:14:35,898
Your family's become quite crafty.

2378
03:14:35,898 --> 03:14:37,668
Was it money, or something else?

2379
03:14:37,668 --> 03:14:40,959
How did you make him lie to me like that?

2380
03:14:40,959 --> 03:14:43,399
I remember him as a man of integrity,

2381
03:14:43,398 --> 03:14:45,388
so how did you buy him off?

2382
03:14:47,929 --> 03:14:51,779
You're well-prepared to taint my name.

2383
03:14:51,779 --> 03:14:54,338
Turning Sangjun into a saint

2384
03:14:54,338 --> 03:14:56,728
will make me look dirtier and pettier.

2385
03:14:56,728 --> 03:14:58,168
On top of stealing money, I'd become

2386
03:14:58,168 --> 03:15:02,218
a bastard who betrayed his best friend.

2387
03:15:02,218 --> 03:15:04,259
Is that the plan?

2388
03:15:04,259 --> 03:15:06,808
Telling the world how dirty and petty I am?

2389
03:15:06,808 --> 03:15:09,198
That's what you're afraid of?

2390
03:15:12,638 --> 03:15:14,828
I'm relieved.

2391
03:15:14,828 --> 03:15:18,259
At least you know what you did was wrong.

2392
03:15:22,689 --> 03:15:24,879
Why did you do it?

2393
03:15:26,918 --> 03:15:29,628
You're not that type of person.

2394
03:15:30,439 --> 03:15:32,869
You valued people,

2395
03:15:32,869 --> 03:15:35,439
and you were very understanding.

2396
03:15:36,978 --> 03:15:40,488
So Sangjun, Mother, and I

2397
03:15:40,488 --> 03:15:43,798
trusted you with everything.

2398
03:15:43,799 --> 03:15:46,509
You were upright and kindhearted.

2399
03:15:49,898 --> 03:15:51,978
What happened to you?

2400
03:15:54,078 --> 03:15:58,488
How did you end up here like this,

2401
03:15:58,488 --> 03:16:03,118
doubting Sangjun's intentions, Mr. Jang?

2402
03:16:13,308 --> 03:16:15,998
Find evidence on how Kim Jiwan

2403
03:16:15,998 --> 03:16:17,478
bought that lawyer off.

2404
03:16:17,478 --> 03:16:18,638
Taesu, what if...

2405
03:16:18,638 --> 03:16:20,208
What if, what?

2406
03:16:20,209 --> 03:16:22,069
You think it might be true?

2407
03:16:22,068 --> 03:16:23,988
But if it's true, I'm...

2408
03:16:29,129 --> 03:16:30,709
No.

2409
03:16:30,709 --> 03:16:33,869
I'm sure there's evidence of him lying.

2410
03:16:33,869 --> 03:16:37,049
What do you think Kim Jiwan offered him?

2411
03:16:37,049 --> 03:16:37,859
Wait...

2412
03:16:37,859 --> 03:16:39,399
Wait, this means

2413
03:16:39,398 --> 03:16:42,468
he can buy my people off, too.

2414
03:16:43,888 --> 03:16:46,618
What are you waiting for? Go find it!

2415
03:16:47,629 --> 03:16:48,919
Yes, sir.

2416
03:16:58,629 --> 03:17:01,329
I'm Ha Yeongho of Daehan Daily.

2417
03:17:02,209 --> 03:17:03,269
I'm Kim Jiwan.

2418
03:17:03,269 --> 03:17:04,568
Have a seat.

2419
03:17:09,388 --> 03:17:12,878
I heard the news from a former employee.

2420
03:17:12,879 --> 03:17:15,259
You've been contacting former directors?

2421
03:17:15,259 --> 03:17:16,718
How many people have you met with?

2422
03:17:16,718 --> 03:17:18,328
About twenty.

2423
03:17:19,199 --> 03:17:20,979
And I've been preparing

2424
03:17:20,978 --> 03:17:22,938
the recordings of their accounts.

2425
03:17:22,939 --> 03:17:24,299
I think I can report the story right away

2426
03:17:24,299 --> 03:17:27,059
if I had a copy of those recordings.

2427
03:17:27,058 --> 03:17:29,408
Can you give me a copy?

2428
03:17:29,408 --> 03:17:30,668
Of course.

2429
03:17:30,668 --> 03:17:33,009
I'll call you once I'm done sorting them.

2430
03:18:35,218 --> 03:18:37,818
Can't fall asleep?

2431
03:18:40,338 --> 03:18:42,838
I can't seem to understand Father.

2432
03:18:44,338 --> 03:18:47,798
Why did he try to put someone like

2433
03:18:47,799 --> 03:18:50,439
Jang Taesu in charge of his money?

2434
03:18:52,269 --> 03:18:53,478
That was so foolish.

2435
03:18:53,478 --> 03:18:54,858
Jiwan.

2436
03:18:56,998 --> 03:18:59,638
Don't blame your father.

2437
03:19:00,199 --> 03:19:03,668
Back then, the only person he could trust

2438
03:19:03,668 --> 03:19:06,209
was Mr. Jang Taesu.

2439
03:19:07,359 --> 03:19:10,639
With his health deteriorating,

2440
03:19:10,638 --> 03:19:14,228
your father was afraid of the future.

2441
03:19:14,888 --> 03:19:17,618
And he thought

2442
03:19:17,619 --> 03:19:22,189
Mr. Jang Taesu could look after us.

2443
03:19:22,189 --> 03:19:24,359
He was wrong.

2444
03:19:25,148 --> 03:19:27,198
He trusted the man

2445
03:19:27,199 --> 03:19:29,838
who stole all his money the day he died.

2446
03:19:29,838 --> 03:19:32,699
If it were me,

2447
03:19:32,699 --> 03:19:34,449
I would've trusted Mr. Jang Taesu, too.

2448
03:19:35,828 --> 03:19:38,718
He was a different man

2449
03:19:38,718 --> 03:19:40,928
from who he is now.

2450
03:19:40,929 --> 03:19:42,978
And that's why I can't forgive him.

2451
03:19:42,978 --> 03:19:45,058
As a human being,

2452
03:19:45,058 --> 03:19:46,198
you cannot betray someone

2453
03:19:46,199 --> 03:19:48,019
who trusts you.

2454
03:21:32,879 --> 03:21:34,649
Hyeondo.

2455
03:21:36,888 --> 03:21:41,308
Why not resign from your father's company?

2456
03:21:45,279 --> 03:21:49,658
I'll look into another job for you.

2457
03:21:53,388 --> 03:21:55,268
I should go to work.

2458
03:22:06,158 --> 03:22:08,408
Sugyeong came to see you?

2459
03:22:08,408 --> 03:22:11,828
She really begged for your forgiveness?

2460
03:22:12,939 --> 03:22:16,269
Sugyeong looked really bad.

2461
03:22:17,379 --> 03:22:19,639
I think she's miserable.

2462
03:22:19,638 --> 03:22:21,188
She should be.

2463
03:22:21,189 --> 03:22:22,639
Of course.

2464
03:22:22,638 --> 03:22:25,748
If she's not, she's not human.

2465
03:22:26,439 --> 03:22:30,068
Wait, but why do you sound so sad?

2466
03:22:30,068 --> 03:22:31,638
What?

2467
03:22:32,388 --> 03:22:35,768
Seeing her miserable made you soft?

2468
03:22:35,769 --> 03:22:38,119
Oh, my.

2469
03:22:38,119 --> 03:22:40,369
You sure are a saint.

2470
03:22:41,019 --> 03:22:42,869
She's going through a rough time after

2471
03:22:42,869 --> 03:22:46,129
a life of luxury, and you feel sorry?

2472
03:22:46,129 --> 03:22:49,389
You're the one I feel sorry for.

2473
03:22:50,439 --> 03:22:55,969
It seems as though Hyeondo is sick.

2474
03:22:55,968 --> 03:22:57,768
He's at the hospital.

2475
03:22:57,769 --> 03:22:59,789
Hyeondo?

2476
03:22:59,789 --> 03:23:01,409
How could a child be healthy

2477
03:23:01,408 --> 03:23:03,738
when his parents have no morals?

2478
03:23:03,738 --> 03:23:07,509
Karma passes down to children.

2479
03:23:10,299 --> 03:23:14,009
Thank you for helping me in Russia.

2480
03:23:14,629 --> 03:23:16,139
How could I say no to you?

2481
03:23:16,138 --> 03:23:18,448
I had to do it.

2482
03:23:18,449 --> 03:23:19,838
So I was thinking,

2483
03:23:19,838 --> 03:23:21,769
I heard you might end up

2484
03:23:21,769 --> 03:23:24,578
taking over the company.

2485
03:23:24,578 --> 03:23:26,849
There's an idea

2486
03:23:26,849 --> 03:23:30,369
I've been developing for five years,

2487
03:23:30,369 --> 03:23:33,189
and going to Russia gave me

2488
03:23:33,189 --> 03:23:35,259
reaffirmation on my idea.

2489
03:23:35,259 --> 03:23:37,679
So I was wondering

2490
03:23:37,679 --> 03:23:40,929
if you could give me a chance

2491
03:23:40,929 --> 03:23:43,379
to present that idea to you.

2492
03:23:47,259 --> 03:23:48,959
Please don't joke around with me.

2493
03:23:49,648 --> 03:23:51,108
I'm not...

2494
03:23:51,109 --> 03:23:54,789
Yes, I know I was hard on you,

2495
03:23:54,789 --> 03:23:56,869
and made your life difficult.

2496
03:23:56,869 --> 03:24:00,809
I saw talent when I saw you, so,

2497
03:24:00,808 --> 03:24:02,838
yes, like in Chinese novels,

2498
03:24:02,838 --> 03:24:04,388
in order to make someone a hero,

2499
03:24:04,388 --> 03:24:06,468
people around him

2500
03:24:06,468 --> 03:24:09,259
create hardships for him.

2501
03:24:09,259 --> 03:24:11,209
All Chinese heroes are like that.

2502
03:24:11,209 --> 03:24:13,338
They prevail over and over again,

2503
03:24:13,338 --> 03:24:14,328
and accomplish...

2504
03:24:14,328 --> 03:24:15,929
It's okay.

2505
03:24:15,929 --> 03:24:16,859
No, I...

2506
03:24:16,859 --> 03:24:18,899
I said it's okay!

2507
03:24:19,568 --> 03:24:20,878
Why do you keep bugging me!

2508
03:24:20,879 --> 03:24:22,379
I said it's okay!

2509
03:24:22,379 --> 03:24:23,919
Something great.

2510
03:24:26,269 --> 03:24:27,599
I think you're mistaken.

2511
03:24:27,599 --> 03:24:29,058
It's okay.

2512
03:24:29,058 --> 03:24:31,418
Sorry for cutting you off, but you're...

2513
03:24:31,988 --> 03:24:33,378
No, I'm not mistaken.

2514
03:24:33,379 --> 03:24:35,338
I think you're mistaken.

2515
03:24:35,338 --> 03:24:38,209
It's not like that. Just think about it.

2516
03:24:38,689 --> 03:24:41,519
When you asked me for a favor like that,

2517
03:24:41,519 --> 03:24:45,289
wasn't it because we are close?

2518
03:24:46,328 --> 03:24:47,958
- Yes. / - Right?

2519
03:24:47,959 --> 03:24:53,519
So since we share a special relationship,

2520
03:24:53,519 --> 03:24:54,488
let me present it in a special...

2521
03:24:54,488 --> 03:24:55,599
Jiwan.

2522
03:24:56,009 --> 03:24:57,078
Hi, Eunsu.

2523
03:24:57,078 --> 03:24:58,408
Ms. Han Eunsu!

2524
03:24:58,408 --> 03:25:00,509
Oh? Hello.

2525
03:25:00,509 --> 03:25:01,998
What are you doing here?

2526
03:25:04,228 --> 03:25:05,798
Huh?

2527
03:25:07,869 --> 03:25:09,889
She's my little sister.

2528
03:25:10,888 --> 03:25:12,408
Your real sister?

2529
03:25:12,408 --> 03:25:13,529
Yes.

2530
03:25:13,849 --> 03:25:18,478
But her last name's Han, and yours is Kim.

2531
03:25:20,119 --> 03:25:21,668
Jiwan, Eunsu.

2532
03:25:21,668 --> 03:25:23,558
- Hi, Aunt. / - Hi.

2533
03:25:24,148 --> 03:25:25,158
Remember?

2534
03:25:25,158 --> 03:25:27,849
This is Mr. Yun, my former team leader.

2535
03:25:27,849 --> 03:25:29,238
- Hello. / - She's my aunt.

2536
03:25:29,238 --> 03:25:30,198
Oh, Aunt.

2537
03:25:30,199 --> 03:25:33,739
Hello, I am Yun Oyong.

2538
03:25:35,259 --> 03:25:36,308
Hi.

2539
03:25:36,308 --> 03:25:39,558
I'm Park Haengsuk.

2540
03:25:39,558 --> 03:25:40,778
Excuse me?

2541
03:25:40,779 --> 03:25:42,619
Park...

2542
03:25:42,619 --> 03:25:46,399
You're his aunt, but your last name is Park?

2543
03:25:48,129 --> 03:25:53,449
Kim, Han and Park.

2544
03:25:53,449 --> 03:25:56,069
A family with different last names?

2545
03:26:01,408 --> 03:26:04,038
What happened?

2546
03:26:04,039 --> 03:26:05,619
Why is that office empty?

2547
03:26:05,619 --> 03:26:08,338
All the desks and chairs are gone.

2548
03:26:08,338 --> 03:26:09,939
Oh, that office?

2549
03:26:09,939 --> 03:26:11,439
They moved out.

2550
03:26:11,439 --> 03:26:13,189
They moved out?

2551
03:26:13,189 --> 03:26:15,369
Where did they go?

2552
03:26:15,369 --> 03:26:17,088
Where are my daughter and husband?

2553
03:26:17,088 --> 03:26:22,088
I heard they're pitching a tent at a farm.

2554
03:26:24,888 --> 03:26:26,438
A, a tent?

2555
03:26:33,299 --> 03:26:34,419
Oh,

2556
03:26:34,418 --> 03:26:37,908
I think we need to get a phone line fast.

2557
03:26:37,908 --> 03:26:39,189
When is the phone guy coming?

2558
03:26:39,189 --> 03:26:41,049
He'll be here at 3.

2559
03:26:41,049 --> 03:26:43,039
Where should the line go?

2560
03:26:43,039 --> 03:26:44,549
I'll find a spot.

2561
03:26:44,929 --> 03:26:46,238
I'll take that, Yeongju.

2562
03:26:53,328 --> 03:26:55,378
You shouldn't bite off more than you can chew,

2563
03:26:55,379 --> 03:26:57,009
and mingle with your own kind!

2564
03:26:57,009 --> 03:27:00,209
You're suffering because of Jiwan!

2565
03:27:00,209 --> 03:27:02,109
It's my fault for signing a contract

2566
03:27:02,109 --> 03:27:04,679
that says the owner can evict us at any time.

2567
03:27:04,679 --> 03:27:06,388
How dare you side with Jiwan!

2568
03:27:06,388 --> 03:27:08,358
I'm going to get him for this!

2569
03:27:09,488 --> 03:27:10,599
Honey, Mi...

2570
03:27:13,959 --> 03:27:15,509
What did Mom say?

2571
03:27:17,248 --> 03:27:20,148
She's going to get Jiwan.

2572
03:27:20,148 --> 03:27:21,458
What?

2573
03:27:22,238 --> 03:27:23,179
Seriously...

2574
03:27:23,179 --> 03:27:24,509
Let's hurry up.

2575
03:27:28,468 --> 03:27:29,958
Jiwan, you!

2576
03:27:30,199 --> 03:27:31,069
Hello.

2577
03:27:31,068 --> 03:27:32,368
Just a second.

2578
03:27:32,808 --> 03:27:34,078
Hello.

2579
03:27:34,859 --> 03:27:37,619
It's an important meeting. This way.

2580
03:27:38,068 --> 03:27:40,138
Everything looks great.

2581
03:27:40,138 --> 03:27:43,838
I can see, now that I'm here.

2582
03:27:43,838 --> 03:27:47,468
You put up a makeshift office near the farm.

2583
03:27:47,468 --> 03:27:51,348
It shows your concern for quality control.

2584
03:27:51,349 --> 03:27:52,639
I just need to sign here, yes?

2585
03:27:52,638 --> 03:27:54,038
Yes.

2586
03:27:59,519 --> 03:28:00,689
Thank you.

2587
03:28:00,689 --> 03:28:01,658
I hope this works out great.

2588
03:28:01,658 --> 03:28:02,689
Thank you.

2589
03:28:08,349 --> 03:28:09,408
Goodbye.

2590
03:28:09,408 --> 03:28:11,689
That guy

2591
03:28:11,689 --> 03:28:13,389
is great at many things.

2592
03:28:13,388 --> 03:28:15,238
He's amazing.

2593
03:28:15,238 --> 03:28:17,658
He performs better under pressure.

2594
03:28:19,039 --> 03:28:21,549
Ms. Lee, it must've been hard to find us.

2595
03:28:21,549 --> 03:28:22,979
And it's such a hot day.

2596
03:28:22,978 --> 03:28:25,558
Let me get you something cool to drink.

2597
03:28:25,558 --> 03:28:26,878
Mr. Jang.

2598
03:28:32,968 --> 03:28:34,978
This is worth $30,000.

2599
03:28:39,509 --> 03:28:42,879
Dad, why did you say it was Jiwan's fault?

2600
03:28:42,879 --> 03:28:44,669
Hey, cut me some slack.

2601
03:28:44,668 --> 03:28:46,078
I was caught off guard.

2602
03:28:46,078 --> 03:28:47,408
It slipped out.

2603
03:28:47,408 --> 03:28:48,699
I can't believe you.

2604
03:28:48,998 --> 03:28:51,849
It's cooked. Yes, have some.

2605
03:28:53,129 --> 03:28:54,249
Director, you're here.

2606
03:28:54,248 --> 03:28:55,658
- Mr. Kang, you're here. / - Honey.

2607
03:28:55,658 --> 03:28:57,019
Yes.

2608
03:28:58,218 --> 03:28:59,509
What are you doing here?

2609
03:29:00,058 --> 03:29:01,458
What do you think?

2610
03:29:01,459 --> 03:29:03,279
They are working so hard on a hot day,

2611
03:29:03,279 --> 03:29:04,799
so I bought them Korean pork

2612
03:29:04,799 --> 03:29:07,399
to help them restore some energy.

2613
03:29:07,398 --> 03:29:10,278
Domestic is always the best.

2614
03:29:10,279 --> 03:29:12,668
Of course. You're a wise man.

2615
03:29:14,209 --> 03:29:16,869
Honey, don't just stand there. Come and sit.

2616
03:29:16,869 --> 03:29:18,479
- Come here. / - Yeongju, come and sit down.

2617
03:29:18,478 --> 03:29:19,948
Yes, Yeongju, come and eat.

2618
03:29:19,949 --> 03:29:21,049
Let me go get some more lettuce.

2619
03:29:21,049 --> 03:29:22,259
Okay.

2620
03:29:28,478 --> 03:29:29,688
Wait,

2621
03:29:29,689 --> 03:29:31,849
weren't you mad at Jiwan?

2622
03:29:31,849 --> 03:29:33,199
What's going on?

2623
03:29:33,199 --> 03:29:34,479
Oh, I can't believe you.

2624
03:29:34,478 --> 03:29:36,538
When? People might actually believe that.

2625
03:29:36,539 --> 03:29:38,639
Why would I talk badly about Jiwan?

2626
03:29:38,638 --> 03:29:42,108
When I came here, Jiwan was doing great,

2627
03:29:42,109 --> 03:29:44,899
so I bought him Korean pork,

2628
03:29:44,898 --> 03:29:46,838
to help him restore energy.

2629
03:29:46,838 --> 03:29:49,298
Why are you just sitting there?

2630
03:29:49,299 --> 03:29:51,079
Go and help wash the lettuce.

2631
03:29:51,078 --> 03:29:52,269
Go help Jiwan.

2632
03:29:52,718 --> 03:29:54,188
Okay.

2633
03:29:55,838 --> 03:29:59,619
I'm a great judge of character.

2634
03:29:59,619 --> 03:30:03,429
Mom, just have one spoonful.

2635
03:30:03,429 --> 03:30:04,299
Say ah.

2636
03:30:04,299 --> 03:30:07,279
I don't want any chicken porridge.

2637
03:30:07,279 --> 03:30:10,209
It's not just chicken. It has ginseng, too.

2638
03:30:10,209 --> 03:30:12,709
You need to eat warm food in the summer,

2639
03:30:12,709 --> 03:30:15,379
so you can restore energy, okay?

2640
03:30:15,379 --> 03:30:17,599
Just have one spoonful.

2641
03:30:17,599 --> 03:30:18,728
Say ah.

2642
03:30:24,658 --> 03:30:26,578
See?

2643
03:30:26,578 --> 03:30:29,468
You're upset because of what you said.

2644
03:30:29,468 --> 03:30:31,888
I didn't say anything wrong.

2645
03:30:31,888 --> 03:30:35,248
Imagine how Seonhui and Eunsu must feel.

2646
03:30:35,248 --> 03:30:38,189
You're worried about Eunsu, aren't you?

2647
03:30:39,898 --> 03:30:41,568
I hope she gets over Hyeondo,

2648
03:30:41,568 --> 03:30:44,019
and meets someone nice.

2649
03:30:44,978 --> 03:30:47,298
I'm sure she will.

2650
03:30:47,888 --> 03:30:50,558
Couples form and break up all the time.

2651
03:30:52,689 --> 03:30:55,759
Jiwan doesn't have a girlfriend?

2652
03:30:55,759 --> 03:30:59,009
Jiwan has no time for that.

2653
03:31:01,148 --> 03:31:02,358
This?

2654
03:31:05,658 --> 03:31:07,158
You see,

2655
03:31:07,638 --> 03:31:11,268
here are the size and unit.

2656
03:31:14,529 --> 03:31:16,509
Hi.

2657
03:31:18,818 --> 03:31:22,028
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

2658
03:31:22,328 --> 03:31:24,478
Don't say that. I'm glad you're here.

2659
03:31:24,478 --> 03:31:26,158
But why are you here?

2660
03:31:28,599 --> 03:31:31,039
Oh, I'm stuffed.

2661
03:31:31,039 --> 03:31:34,918
You must really love spicy chicken stew.

2662
03:31:34,918 --> 03:31:36,398
You ate a lot of it.

2663
03:31:36,398 --> 03:31:37,898
Because it was delicious.

2664
03:31:40,859 --> 03:31:43,988
It's late, so take Yeongju home.

2665
03:31:43,988 --> 03:31:46,109
It's okay. I can go home alone.

2666
03:31:46,539 --> 03:31:47,459
Don't say that.

2667
03:31:47,459 --> 03:31:49,739
It's late. What if you get kidnapped?

2668
03:31:49,738 --> 03:31:50,838
Take her home.

2669
03:31:50,838 --> 03:31:52,349
No, that's not going to happen.

2670
03:31:52,349 --> 03:31:53,908
Don't say that. Just go.

2671
03:31:53,908 --> 03:31:55,478
What are you two doing?

2672
03:31:55,478 --> 03:31:56,878
Let's go. I'll walk you home.

2673
03:31:56,879 --> 03:31:58,789
- What? / - Go home, and go to bed.

2674
03:31:58,789 --> 03:32:00,069
- Let's go, Yeongju. / - Bye.

2675
03:32:00,068 --> 03:32:01,028
Okay.

2676
03:32:01,029 --> 03:32:02,389
- Bye. / - Goodnight.

2677
03:32:14,299 --> 03:32:16,429
Are those two dating?

2678
03:32:17,119 --> 03:32:19,239
They're not together yet,

2679
03:32:19,238 --> 03:32:22,158
but they are testing the waters.

2680
03:32:23,978 --> 03:32:26,658
It's frustrating to watch them.

2681
03:32:26,658 --> 03:32:28,288
Yeongju...

2682
03:32:29,019 --> 03:32:30,449
She's nice.

2683
03:32:30,449 --> 03:32:31,789
She is.

2684
03:32:31,789 --> 03:32:33,979
She's pretty and pleasant.

2685
03:32:33,978 --> 03:32:37,228
And she's a teacher.

2686
03:32:37,228 --> 03:32:38,378
Don't you think they look good together?

2687
03:32:38,379 --> 03:32:40,069
Yes, they do.

2688
03:32:50,519 --> 03:32:51,738
(Unique Spicy Chicken Stew)

2689
03:33:16,088 --> 03:33:18,619
Ms. Kang Yeongju, what's all this?

2690
03:33:18,619 --> 03:33:20,479
Why are you cooking all of a sudden?

2691
03:33:22,168 --> 03:33:23,748
I'm just practicing.

2692
03:33:24,158 --> 03:33:25,699
Practicing?

2693
03:33:29,349 --> 03:33:31,519
Oh, I get it.

2694
03:33:31,519 --> 03:33:32,549
Girl...

2695
03:33:32,549 --> 03:33:35,939
You have a good eye.

2696
03:33:35,939 --> 03:33:36,748
What do you mean?

2697
03:33:36,748 --> 03:33:38,628
Jiwan.

2698
03:33:38,629 --> 03:33:40,309
Who cares about education?

2699
03:33:40,308 --> 03:33:43,808
To me, money trumps everything.

2700
03:33:43,808 --> 03:33:46,808
Stop getting ahead of yourself.

2701
03:33:49,328 --> 03:33:51,168
Seonhui is a decent mother-in-law.

2702
03:33:51,168 --> 03:33:53,449
Eunsu is easy.

2703
03:33:53,449 --> 03:33:56,879
The grandmother-in-law will become forgetful.

2704
03:33:57,488 --> 03:34:01,429
Haengsuk. She's the one to watch out for.

2705
03:34:01,429 --> 03:34:03,318
I'm sick of your marriage talk.

2706
03:34:03,318 --> 03:34:04,679
I told you it's not like that.

2707
03:34:04,679 --> 03:34:05,549
Just leave me alone.

2708
03:34:05,549 --> 03:34:08,439
How could I leave you alone?

2709
03:34:08,439 --> 03:34:10,088
You won't go on blind dates,

2710
03:34:10,088 --> 03:34:12,418
but you can't even make Jiwan yours.

2711
03:34:13,468 --> 03:34:14,958
If it were me in the old days,

2712
03:34:14,959 --> 03:34:16,879
I would've already...

2713
03:34:17,629 --> 03:34:19,349
What's the use of giving you my looks?

2714
03:34:19,349 --> 03:34:20,998
Just look at yourself.

2715
03:34:20,998 --> 03:34:24,078
You're dressed like a tomboy,

2716
03:34:24,078 --> 03:34:25,958
and you haven't taken a shower.

2717
03:34:25,959 --> 03:34:28,909
You need to make yourself look pretty!

2718
03:34:28,908 --> 03:34:31,599
Practicing cooking won't help you at all.

2719
03:34:31,599 --> 03:34:34,099
If a girl is pretty, nothing else matters.

2720
03:34:34,099 --> 03:34:35,568
You have to look pretty!

2721
03:34:35,568 --> 03:34:37,429
What good will cooking do for you?

2722
03:34:37,429 --> 03:34:38,799
Besides your pretty face,

2723
03:34:38,799 --> 03:34:41,549
you got nothing from me!

2724
03:34:41,549 --> 03:34:43,859
What do you mean? Like this?

2725
03:34:46,818 --> 03:34:47,988
Oh, you're impossible.

2726
03:34:47,988 --> 03:34:50,439
You're my daughter, but you're impossible!

2727
03:34:50,439 --> 03:34:53,309
Be more like Oh Minja! Like me!

2728
03:34:55,888 --> 03:34:56,958
Minja.

2729
03:34:56,959 --> 03:34:57,879
Oh!

2730
03:34:57,879 --> 03:34:58,849
Ms. Lee!

2731
03:34:58,849 --> 03:34:59,898
What are you doing here?

2732
03:34:59,898 --> 03:35:03,198
I need a new pillow for my neck pain.

2733
03:35:03,199 --> 03:35:04,689
What about you?

2734
03:35:05,328 --> 03:35:08,179
Yeongju's been complaining about neck pain, too.

2735
03:35:09,468 --> 03:35:10,748
Well,

2736
03:35:10,748 --> 03:35:14,359
is Yeongju still going on blind dates?

2737
03:35:15,838 --> 03:35:17,168
I've given up on that.

2738
03:35:17,168 --> 03:35:18,519
How they feel about each other is important,

2739
03:35:18,519 --> 03:35:20,248
not their background.

2740
03:35:20,699 --> 03:35:23,509
You're right!

2741
03:35:23,509 --> 03:35:28,689
But I heard you hold education very high.

2742
03:35:29,568 --> 03:35:32,859
If they're in love, education doesn't matter.

2743
03:35:32,859 --> 03:35:35,899
As long as he's hard-working, it's fine.

2744
03:35:36,638 --> 03:35:41,759
But isn't a small family better?

2745
03:35:42,588 --> 03:35:45,929
I would prefer a small family,

2746
03:35:45,929 --> 03:35:47,328
but these days, as complicated as it is,

2747
03:35:47,328 --> 03:35:50,619
people don't live with married children.

2748
03:35:50,619 --> 03:35:53,039
- You mean live separately? / - Yes.

2749
03:35:54,179 --> 03:35:55,738
But that's...

2750
03:35:55,738 --> 03:35:57,578
Well...

2751
03:35:57,578 --> 03:35:59,949
Old people don't live forever.

2752
03:35:59,949 --> 03:36:02,649
And I'm dying to have a great-grandchild.

2753
03:36:03,179 --> 03:36:05,699
I'm not going to let my daughter

2754
03:36:05,699 --> 03:36:07,509
date anyone with a large family.

2755
03:36:07,509 --> 03:36:09,918
What if she gets stuck with them?

2756
03:36:09,918 --> 03:36:11,738
That won't be good.

2757
03:36:13,369 --> 03:36:16,549
Yes, getting stuck is the key.

2758
03:36:16,888 --> 03:36:18,658
As long as they live separately,

2759
03:36:18,658 --> 03:36:21,228
you don't mind a big family?

2760
03:36:21,228 --> 03:36:22,778
Of course not.

2761
03:36:22,779 --> 03:36:25,078
As long as they are in love.

2762
03:36:25,959 --> 03:36:26,849
Why do you ask?

2763
03:36:26,849 --> 03:36:30,639
You have someone in mind?

2764
03:36:30,638 --> 03:36:32,088
Of course.

2765
03:36:33,908 --> 03:36:36,068
- You do? / - Yes.

2766
03:36:47,238 --> 03:36:50,009
Hello, I'm Ha Yeongho from Daehan Daily.

2767
03:36:50,009 --> 03:36:53,769
Someone tipped me off about Taehu Industry.

2768
03:36:53,769 --> 03:36:56,809
You drove Taehu Industry into bankruptcy,

2769
03:36:56,808 --> 03:37:00,018
and stole millions in funds. Is that true?

2770
03:37:00,019 --> 03:37:01,599
There are protocols for reporters...

2771
03:37:01,599 --> 03:37:03,189
Your former employee Lee Seokjin, and

2772
03:37:03,189 --> 03:37:05,908
former directors will be giving statements!

2773
03:37:05,908 --> 03:37:07,298
Tell me if it's true,

2774
03:37:07,299 --> 03:37:09,549
or if it's slander!

2775
03:37:09,549 --> 03:37:12,459
President Jang!

2776
03:37:12,459 --> 03:37:13,579
Please leave.

2777
03:37:16,888 --> 03:37:18,918
Refuse all interviews.

2778
03:37:19,539 --> 03:37:21,079
It wasn't Kim Jiwan.

2779
03:37:21,968 --> 03:37:24,408
Don't jump the gun, or get them involved.

2780
03:37:24,408 --> 03:37:26,449
I'm sure the reporter heard a rumor.

2781
03:37:28,318 --> 03:37:29,548
If he had all the evidence,

2782
03:37:29,549 --> 03:37:31,669
he would've written about it already.

2783
03:37:32,429 --> 03:37:34,918
I'm coming in, so make sure no one talks.

2784
03:37:34,918 --> 03:37:38,269
I told you to find him, by any means!

2785
03:37:38,269 --> 03:37:39,109
What are you doing?

2786
03:37:39,109 --> 03:37:40,939
Is it that you can't or won't?

2787
03:37:43,299 --> 03:37:45,019
Seokjin was

2788
03:37:45,019 --> 03:37:47,759
with us from the birth of Taehu Industry,

2789
03:37:47,759 --> 03:37:49,759
and is still with us today.

2790
03:37:50,838 --> 03:37:54,048
Dongjin still calls us to congratulate us

2791
03:37:54,049 --> 03:37:56,459
whenever we reach a new milestone.

2792
03:37:57,849 --> 03:38:01,709
Hyeokju practically lived with us

2793
03:38:01,709 --> 03:38:03,389
at the factory.

2794
03:38:04,509 --> 03:38:06,968
So how could I

2795
03:38:06,968 --> 03:38:10,378
dig into their past, and make threats?

2796
03:38:11,359 --> 03:38:12,889
Taesu!

2797
03:38:16,318 --> 03:38:18,849
You've been paid off, too?

2798
03:38:21,308 --> 03:38:24,398
I know you met with Seokjin.

2799
03:38:24,398 --> 03:38:26,578
I wasn't sure.

2800
03:38:27,068 --> 03:38:28,388
So, what did you get from them?

2801
03:38:28,388 --> 03:38:31,318
How much did they pay you!

2802
03:38:31,949 --> 03:38:33,338
Taesu...

2803
03:38:33,338 --> 03:38:34,588
Get out.

2804
03:38:34,588 --> 03:38:35,568
You're fired!

2805
03:38:35,568 --> 03:38:36,939
Get lost!

2806
03:39:39,088 --> 03:39:40,738
Hyeondo,

2807
03:39:41,468 --> 03:39:44,198
I once told your father

2808
03:39:44,199 --> 03:39:46,489
to watch his back because of you.

2809
03:39:49,099 --> 03:39:51,478
And he said to me,

2810
03:39:53,138 --> 03:39:55,198
even if you betrayed him, that was okay.

2811
03:39:56,398 --> 03:39:58,378
Because you're his son.

2812
03:40:02,488 --> 03:40:04,509
Look after Taesu.

2813
03:40:06,728 --> 03:40:09,228
I can't seem to do it anymore.

2814
03:41:03,119 --> 03:41:06,469
Is this Mr. Han Yeongho of Daehan Daily?

2815
03:41:06,468 --> 03:41:08,338
This is Kim Jiwan.

2816
03:41:09,568 --> 03:41:12,958
Can we have that interview tomorrow?

2817
03:41:20,029 --> 03:41:21,649
Yes, Mr. Han.

2818
03:41:22,908 --> 03:41:24,588
I'm on my way.

2819
03:42:23,269 --> 03:42:24,828
Your father was going to

2820
03:42:26,039 --> 03:42:29,629
hand over his company to my father?

2821
03:42:32,908 --> 03:42:35,408
I couldn't understand him at first,

2822
03:42:37,689 --> 03:42:40,689
but now that I think about it,

2823
03:42:40,689 --> 03:42:42,619
I can understand him a little bit.

2824
03:42:56,168 --> 03:42:58,289
This is all the evidence I've collected.

2825
03:43:02,648 --> 03:43:04,538
Why are you giving them to me?

2826
03:43:09,679 --> 03:43:11,699
Why did you

2827
03:43:11,699 --> 03:43:13,859
give me that notebook?

2828
03:43:47,259 --> 03:43:48,578
Have you had a lot to drink?

2829
03:43:49,908 --> 03:43:53,429
You asked me here, so why are you late?

2830
03:43:58,049 --> 03:43:59,979
I met Jiwan.

2831
03:44:03,408 --> 03:44:05,689
Uncle Sangjun

2832
03:44:07,369 --> 03:44:10,679
was going to give you all his money?

2833
03:44:11,429 --> 03:44:13,338
That's a lie.

2834
03:44:14,109 --> 03:44:16,029
Right?

2835
03:44:19,488 --> 03:44:22,349
Who would actually do that?

2836
03:44:22,349 --> 03:44:24,679
Why would he give you his company

2837
03:44:24,679 --> 03:44:27,299
when he has a son and a family?

2838
03:44:27,299 --> 03:44:29,219
That's ridiculous.

2839
03:44:29,879 --> 03:44:31,699
You were just a friend.

2840
03:44:32,818 --> 03:44:34,609
Not his blood.

2841
03:44:38,638 --> 03:44:40,548
Don't you agree?

2842
03:44:42,189 --> 03:44:43,769
Yes.

2843
03:44:44,369 --> 03:44:46,349
I'm not his blood.

2844
03:44:49,238 --> 03:44:51,548
But,

2845
03:44:52,379 --> 03:44:55,129
even though I wasn't his blood,

2846
03:44:55,129 --> 03:44:58,769
Sangjun might have actually really

2847
03:44:58,769 --> 03:45:02,918
wanted to give me his company.

2848
03:45:05,908 --> 03:45:09,478
But why...

2849
03:45:09,478 --> 03:45:11,998
How could he trust me so much?

2850
03:45:49,468 --> 03:45:50,708
Jiwan.

2851
03:45:54,109 --> 03:45:57,449
Do you

2852
03:45:57,449 --> 03:46:00,328
remember Dad?

2853
03:46:03,359 --> 03:46:05,219
A little bit.

2854
03:46:08,328 --> 03:46:14,068
What kind of person was he?

2855
03:46:16,949 --> 03:46:20,139
He smiled at me whenever he saw me.

2856
03:46:27,689 --> 03:46:30,248
Why did

2857
03:46:32,119 --> 03:46:36,429
Dad trust a man like him?

2858
03:46:38,619 --> 03:46:41,219
He was so foolish.

2859
03:46:45,689 --> 03:46:48,668
You think so, too, don't you?

2860
03:47:59,369 --> 03:48:00,789
How have you been?

2861
03:48:13,668 --> 03:48:15,738
Don't turn bad.

2862
03:48:18,209 --> 03:48:20,879
That's not who you are, Hyeondo.

2863
03:48:31,808 --> 03:48:33,418
I should go.

2864
03:49:13,429 --> 03:49:14,668
The Korean Businessmen's Association

2865
03:49:14,668 --> 03:49:18,488
recommended you as a next chairperson.

2866
03:49:18,949 --> 03:49:22,879
You're to give an acceptance speech.

2867
03:49:24,328 --> 03:49:25,568
Okay.

2868
03:49:25,568 --> 03:49:27,048
I got it.

2869
03:49:27,629 --> 03:49:29,079
Oh, and

2870
03:49:29,078 --> 03:49:31,179
call my wife's lawyer,

2871
03:49:31,179 --> 03:49:33,199
and have him visit me here.

2872
03:49:33,199 --> 03:49:34,639
Yes, sir.

2873
03:49:42,728 --> 03:49:44,679
President Jang wants to see you

2874
03:49:44,679 --> 03:49:46,558
before going to court.

2875
03:49:47,859 --> 03:49:49,488
What is it about?

2876
03:49:49,488 --> 03:49:52,078
He said he will tell you in person.

2877
03:50:45,568 --> 03:50:48,769
You like the coffee here, don't you?

2878
03:50:48,769 --> 03:50:51,699
You didn't call me here for coffee.

2879
03:50:51,699 --> 03:50:53,699
What is this about?

2880
03:50:54,748 --> 03:50:56,958
I called you over to have a cup of coffee.

2881
03:50:57,808 --> 03:50:59,429
Excuse me.

2882
03:51:21,209 --> 03:51:24,449
I came because you like it here,

2883
03:51:24,449 --> 03:51:26,069
but to me, the company

2884
03:51:26,068 --> 03:51:29,218
vending machine coffee's the best.

2885
03:51:30,439 --> 03:51:34,498
You've always had cheap taste.

2886
03:51:34,498 --> 03:51:35,838
What?

2887
03:51:35,838 --> 03:51:38,019
You hate me because of my cheap taste?

2888
03:51:38,588 --> 03:51:40,968
No,

2889
03:51:40,968 --> 03:51:43,198
it was easy for me.

2890
03:51:45,888 --> 03:51:47,568
Successful men

2891
03:51:47,568 --> 03:51:51,118
always get a mistress first.

2892
03:51:51,119 --> 03:51:53,418
But

2893
03:51:53,418 --> 03:51:56,478
you have simple taste in everything.

2894
03:51:56,478 --> 03:51:58,628
Vending machine coffee, soju,

2895
03:51:58,629 --> 03:52:00,669
and roasted rice tea after meals.

2896
03:52:01,949 --> 03:52:04,539
And with women, only Jeong Sugyeong.

2897
03:52:06,299 --> 03:52:09,489
I did have simple taste,

2898
03:52:09,488 --> 03:52:12,088
but it was never cheap.

2899
03:52:14,978 --> 03:52:19,878
I loved having you

2900
03:52:19,879 --> 03:52:21,669
as my husband.

2901
03:52:24,498 --> 03:52:27,838
I respected you

2902
03:52:27,838 --> 03:52:32,658
more than anyone.

2903
03:52:37,509 --> 03:52:40,578
If you are willing to change,

2904
03:52:40,578 --> 03:52:43,509
nothing will change between us.

2905
03:52:51,529 --> 03:52:56,189
Will Jeong Sugyeong still love Jang Taesu

2906
03:52:56,189 --> 03:52:59,459
without his money and honor?

2907
03:53:03,228 --> 03:53:06,588
That's why it can't be, Ms. Jeong.

2908
03:53:17,488 --> 03:53:19,078
This is the divorce papers.

2909
03:53:19,078 --> 03:53:21,099
I already signed it,

2910
03:53:21,099 --> 03:53:23,129
so you take care of the rest.

2911
03:55:06,658 --> 03:55:09,878
Are you sure you want to let this go?

2912
03:55:11,009 --> 03:55:13,498
You won't regret it?

2913
03:55:15,318 --> 03:55:17,748
That was what Father wanted.

2914
03:55:18,988 --> 03:55:21,269
If President Jang

2915
03:55:21,269 --> 03:55:25,139
doesn't change his ways after finding out

2916
03:55:26,039 --> 03:55:28,739
what Father wanted, he'll be more miserable.

2917
03:55:49,058 --> 03:55:52,198
Hello, everyone.

2918
03:55:52,199 --> 03:55:54,709
I'm Jang Taesu from Best Global,

2919
03:55:54,709 --> 03:55:58,149
who recently won Businessman of the Year.

2920
03:56:04,099 --> 03:56:07,998
There are many senior entrepreneurs

2921
03:56:07,998 --> 03:56:09,808
and colleagues who deserve the award,

2922
03:56:09,808 --> 03:56:11,538
so I feel a very big responsibility

2923
03:56:11,539 --> 03:56:13,779
to win this accolade.

2924
03:56:14,218 --> 03:56:18,888
And it's an honor to have the position

2925
03:56:18,888 --> 03:56:21,888
to represent all entrepreneurs.

2926
03:56:23,289 --> 03:56:27,099
Sitting here

2927
03:56:27,099 --> 03:56:29,709
brings back old memories.

2928
03:56:32,478 --> 03:56:37,918
I had a friend.

2929
03:56:38,509 --> 03:56:42,478
He trusted me when I had nothing,

2930
03:56:42,478 --> 03:56:47,058
and helped me get to where I am today.

2931
03:56:47,658 --> 03:56:49,878
He was the president of Taehu Industry

2932
03:56:49,879 --> 03:56:52,979
where Best Global began.

2933
03:56:56,359 --> 03:56:58,759
Kim Sangjun.

2934
03:57:00,699 --> 03:57:04,469
That was my friend's name.

2935
03:57:05,088 --> 03:57:08,408
He was naively trusting,

2936
03:57:08,408 --> 03:57:10,888
and honest

2937
03:57:10,888 --> 03:57:14,558
even to a fault.

2938
03:57:15,888 --> 03:57:18,628
I considered his company

2939
03:57:18,629 --> 03:57:22,079
as my own,

2940
03:57:23,398 --> 03:57:26,328
and worked hard.

2941
03:57:34,168 --> 03:57:37,429
But,

2942
03:57:37,429 --> 03:57:41,478
I

2943
03:57:41,478 --> 03:57:44,599
stole...

2944
03:57:57,318 --> 03:57:59,738
All of his money.

2945
03:58:02,638 --> 03:58:04,108
What did he just say?

2946
03:58:22,388 --> 03:58:26,128
Yeongju, summarize this register, please.

2947
03:58:28,078 --> 03:58:29,699
May I help you?

2948
03:58:33,558 --> 03:58:35,748
Mr. Jang Hyeondo.

2949
03:58:35,748 --> 03:58:38,488
How dare you come here!

2950
03:58:39,578 --> 03:58:41,308
Jang Hyeondo?

2951
03:58:42,189 --> 03:58:44,289
You're that guy?

2952
03:58:44,289 --> 03:58:45,629
How dare you show your face here?

2953
03:58:45,629 --> 03:58:47,319
Get out.

2954
03:59:00,718 --> 03:59:02,908
I'm sorry.

2955
03:59:04,138 --> 03:59:07,368
That's all I can say.

2956
03:59:17,519 --> 03:59:19,059
Yes.

2957
03:59:19,949 --> 03:59:25,498
I tricked my trusting friend's family,

2958
03:59:25,498 --> 03:59:29,119
and bought their shares for pennies.

2959
03:59:29,119 --> 03:59:33,498
And I even kicked his family out

2960
03:59:33,498 --> 03:59:36,429
from their house.

2961
03:59:40,519 --> 03:59:43,259
And so I used

2962
03:59:43,259 --> 03:59:47,328
the stolen money,

2963
03:59:49,289 --> 03:59:53,459
and built my own company.

2964
04:00:04,248 --> 04:00:06,408
(Taehu Industry Stock Certificate, $2.5 Million)

2965
04:00:47,449 --> 04:00:48,879
Dad!

2966
04:02:09,588 --> 04:02:12,548
(KBS 2TV, Weekend Drama, Bluebird's House)

2967
04:02:12,549 --> 04:02:13,499
I knew then,

2968
04:02:13,498 --> 04:02:14,429
(Best Global's Jang Taesu Confesses to Embezzlement)

2969
04:02:14,818 --> 04:02:18,828
I would regret it for the rest of my life.

2970
04:02:18,828 --> 04:02:21,288
Sangjun

2971
04:02:21,289 --> 04:02:24,179
might have died because of me.

2972
04:02:25,379 --> 04:02:27,359
He's giving you what?

2973
04:02:27,359 --> 04:02:28,539
Stocks.

2974
04:02:28,539 --> 04:02:31,679
And he's resigning from his position.

2975
04:02:32,509 --> 04:02:35,468
Why are they so dense,

2976
04:02:35,468 --> 04:02:36,618
when I'm trying to help them?

2977
04:02:36,619 --> 04:02:38,629
They should at least try to

2978
04:02:38,629 --> 04:02:39,979
go on a few dates.

2979
04:02:39,978 --> 04:02:42,148
You're going to let Father be as he is?

2980
04:02:42,148 --> 04:02:45,388
Ma'am, get me a glass of ice water!
