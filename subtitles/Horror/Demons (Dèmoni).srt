1
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:11,458
The Ring of the Fisherman, which bears the official papal seal,

2
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:15,037
must be destroyed immediately following the Pope's death.

3
00:02:16,429 --> 00:02:19,744
The Papal apartment is then sealed for nine days of mourning,

4
00:02:20,545 --> 00:02:24,997
a period known as "Sede Vacante", the time of the empty throne.

5
00:02:27,957 --> 00:02:34,042
Over the last several days, Catholic leaders from
every corner of the world have flocked to Rome,

6
00:02:34,437 --> 00:02:38,646
shocked by the sudden death of this
progressive and beloved pope.

7
00:02:45,745 --> 00:02:53,190
Today, in St. Peter's Square, the faithful pray that there is
among them another leader who can unite their church,

8
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,410
which has been so riven by change and dissent in recent years.

9
00:03:01,227 --> 00:03:03,757
As the body of the pontif passes by,

10
00:03:03,902 --> 00:03:06,999
we see prayers are being offered by the Preferiti,

11
00:03:07,356 --> 00:03:12,951
favorites among those being considered
to succeed him as the Vicar of Christ.

12
00:03:20,335 --> 00:03:22,202
At the end of the mourning period,

13
00:03:22,321 --> 00:03:27,655
the College of Cardinals will lock itself behind the
doors of the Sistine Chapel for Conclave.

14
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:33,333
The process by which they will choose a new
leader for the world's one billion Catholics

15
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,598
who now find their church at a crossroads,

16
00:03:36,622 --> 00:03:39,984
its ancient traditions threatened by a modern world.

17
00:03:48,678 --> 00:03:53,200
<i>Attention: Control booth going online.</i>

18
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,816
<i>We are powering up.</i>

<i>Interlock areas are now restricted.</i>

21
00:04:06,316 --> 00:04:08,638
You've blocked all access, Philippe.

22
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,930
You are terrified because you gave it your all.

23
00:04:11,031 --> 00:04:14,100
The accelerator should never create antimatter.

24
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,248
It's only three cylinders under high security.
I only ask you to wait.

25
00:04:18,513 --> 00:04:19,996
We can't wait any longer.

26
00:04:19,997 --> 00:04:22,652
- Antimatter is only the beginning.
- We will have free access.

27
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:26,578
But listen, even with proper calibration,
we might not be prepared.

28
00:04:27,053 --> 00:04:28,949
Just call the director. Stop this.

29
00:04:30,224 --> 00:04:33,507
<i>ATLAS underground is now a restricted vault.</i>

30

32
00:04:37,506 --> 00:04:40,764

<i>Vittoria, what did Phillipe want?</i>

37
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:57,691
He about shitted. We should still wait.

38
00:04:57,692 --> 00:05:00,292
<i>What do you think?</i>

39
00:05:00,356 --> 00:05:04,182
It's now or never.

40
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,517
Beam stability is good. Take your places, people.

41
00:05:07,586 --> 00:05:09,888
<i>ATLAS and CMS checked.</i>

42

<i>Trigger is set. Collision is imminent.</i>

00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,581
Let's hope the heavy ion guys didn't mess up.

44
00:05:24,843 --> 00:05:27,064
<i>Luminosity monitors operational.</i>

<i>Stage 1: Line up.</i>

50
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:40,940
Last P still too high.

51
00:05:41,276 --> 00:05:44,162
<i>We are moving up the luminosity 10 to 34.</i>

55
00:05:54,155 --> 00:05:56,867
<i>The merger may be any time.</i>

<i>We have a signal on the luminosity monitors.</i>

<i>We have events.</i>

<i>Protons are moving.</i>

66
00:06:54,156 --> 00:06:56,381
We have created antimatter.

67
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,689
The unknown has been created.

68
00:07:11,617 --> 00:07:13,637
<i>Silvano, we have succeeded.</i>

69
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,581
<i>We are now in God's hands, Vittoria.</i>

70
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,434
I am on my way.

71
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,901
Silvano?

72
00:08:25,721 --> 00:08:26,832
Silvano!

73
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,484
Oh, God.

74
00:08:51,314 --> 00:08:55,584
Help! Aiuto! Aiuto!

75
00:09:51,911 --> 00:09:56,453
- A swim might help your jet lag.
- I beg your pardon?

76
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:59,155
The bags under your eyes.
It's five in the morning...

77
00:09:59,693 --> 00:10:01,383
and you're from the Vatican.

78
00:10:02,563 --> 00:10:04,706
Crossed keys under the Triregnum.

79
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:06,632
It's a papal symbol.

80
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,645
Claudio Vicenze.
Corpo della Gendarmeria Vaticano.

81
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:15,852
Vatican Police?

82
00:10:17,186 --> 00:10:19,397
I was expecting another letter.

83
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:23,362
My request for access to your archives.

84
00:10:24,777 --> 00:10:26,328
Shouldn't you be in Rome?

85
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,537
- Kind of a busy time for you guys, huh?
- In fact, I was in New York.

86
00:10:30,775 --> 00:10:33,899
A detail to the UN. I received a phone call
in the middle of the night.

87
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:39,062
"Find Professor Robert Langdon. A matter of great urgency."

88
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:42,393
They said to show you this.

89
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:55,314
The Illuminati? They disappeared hundreds of years ago.

90
00:10:55,315 --> 00:10:56,280
Did they?

91
00:10:56,366 --> 00:11:00,682
Look at that again. It's an ambigram.
It's the same image, forward and backward.

92
00:11:00,954 --> 00:11:04,789
Now, that's common for a symbol like a Yin and Yang
or a swastika but... that's a word.

93
00:11:05,124 --> 00:11:09,968
That Illuminati ambigramatic symbol has
been considered a myth for 400 years.

94
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:15,381
Supposedly, in the 16th century, some artist created
it as a tribute to Galileo's love of symmetry.

95
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,451
It was only gonna be revealed when the
Illuminati had amassed enough power

96
00:11:19,452 --> 00:11:23,320
to resurface and carry out their final goal.
I wrote a book about it.

97
00:11:24,189 --> 00:11:25,773
Which is why you're here.

98
00:11:25,742 --> 00:11:28,831
- "The Art of the Illuminati" by Robert Langdon.
- Part One.

99
00:11:29,534 --> 00:11:33,300
I haven't been able to finish Part Two because
I'm not allowed access to your archives.

100
00:11:39,105 --> 00:11:41,473
It's remarkable. Similar.

101
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:45,659
Someone is trying to make you believe the Illuminati
themselves have returned to Rome.

102
00:11:46,027 --> 00:11:47,992
Right after the death of a pope.

103
00:11:51,687 --> 00:11:57,223
Four cardinals were kidnapped from their quarter's inside
the Vatican sometime between 3 and 5 am this morning.

104
00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:02,319
Shortly afterward, that document was
sent to the office of the Swiss Guard

105
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:09,173
along with the threat the Cardinals will be publicly executed
one per hour begining at 8 pm tonight in Rome.

106
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:21,204
The conclave?

107
00:12:21,218 --> 00:12:25,310
Was to begin today. We have postponed the start
for a few hours with the story of illness.

108
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,378
There are no suspicions... yet.

109
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,967
What do you want from me?

110
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:36,882
These criminals, who sent this ambigram,
meant it as a taunt, a provocation.

111
00:12:37,136 --> 00:12:43,784
But Captain Olivetti think if you can use it to learn their identity,
perhaps we can stop this abomination.

112
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:49,043
Why me?

113
00:12:50,007 --> 00:12:53,334
Your expertise. Your erudition.

114
00:12:53,342 --> 00:12:57,719
Your recent involvement with certain church, shall we say...

115
00:12:58,186 --> 00:12:59,025
mysteries.

116
00:13:00,153 --> 00:13:04,233
I wasn't under the impression that episode
had endeared me to the Vatican.

117
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:05,718
Oh, it didn't.

118
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:09,269
But it did make you, what is the word for...

119
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,525
"formidable"?

120
00:13:11,187 --> 00:13:12,801
Formidable?

121
00:13:13,825 --> 00:13:16,560
A Vatican jet is standing by twenty minutes from here.

122
00:13:16,565 --> 00:13:18,134
Will you come with me?

123
00:13:25,964 --> 00:13:27,130
Professor Langdon.

124
00:13:27,134 --> 00:13:31,246
You've spent your life searching for symbols
like the one you now hold in your hand.

125
00:13:31,682 --> 00:13:35,711
How much longer are we going to pretend
you have not already decided to come?

126
00:13:42,187 --> 00:13:48,677
If the Illuminati have returned and are in Rome,
we will hunt them down and kill them.

127
00:13:49,687 --> 00:13:53,348
The Illuminati did not become violent until the 17th century.

128
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:54,763
Their name means 'The Enlightened Ones'.

129
00:13:54,864 --> 00:13:57,836
They were physicists, mathematicians, astronomers.

130
00:13:57,842 --> 00:14:02,719
They were concerned with the church's inaccurate teachings
and they were dedicated to scientific truth.

131
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,355
But the Vatican didn't like that.

132
00:14:04,356 --> 00:14:08,444
So, the church began to, how did you say it?
Oh. Hunt them down and kill them.

133
00:14:09,553 --> 00:14:11,784
Drove them underground

134
00:14:12,374 --> 00:14:14,767
into a secret society.

135
00:15:02,842 --> 00:15:04,572
- Professor Langdon.
- Yes?

136
00:15:04,673 --> 00:15:06,617
Welcome to Vatican City.

137
00:15:06,961 --> 00:15:10,735
Ernesto Olivetti, Inspector General of the Vatican Police Force.

138
00:15:10,736 --> 00:15:12,677
- My pleasure.
- This way please.

139
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:15,658
We'll meet in the headquarters of the Swiss Guard.

140
00:15:15,813 --> 00:15:19,514
- I thought you were Swiss Guard.
- No, uh, the Gendarmaria.

141
00:15:19,515 --> 00:15:22,939
We are responsible for everything inside the Vatican walls

142
00:15:23,274 --> 00:15:26,575
with the exception of the security of His Holiness...

143
00:15:26,576 --> 00:15:28,212
- Yeah.
- and the Apostolic Palace.

144
00:15:28,213 --> 00:15:29,814
That is Swiss Guard.

145
00:15:29,849 --> 00:15:33,443
The Roman Carabinieri are here as
well in an advisory capacity.

146
00:15:33,522 --> 00:15:36,432
- So jurisdictionally this is...
- A goddamn nightmare.

147
00:15:43,528 --> 00:15:47,352
- Oh, yes. Pope Pius IX's great castration.
- I beg your pardon?

148
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:53,066
1857. Pope Pius IX felt the male form would inspire lust.

149
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:58,130
So, he took a hammer and chisel and
'un-manned' hundreds of these statues.

150
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:01,166
The plaster fig leaves were added later.

151
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:06,650
Are you anti-Catholic, Professor Langdon?

152
00:16:07,077 --> 00:16:10,023
No. I'm anti-vandalism.

153
00:16:13,469 --> 00:16:16,266
I urge you to guard your tone here.

154
00:16:16,432 --> 00:16:24,309
The Swiss Guard is a calling, not a profession,
and it encourages a certain civiltry.

155
00:16:25,177 --> 00:16:29,295
Commander Richter, the head of the Guard,
is a deeply spiritual man.

156
00:16:29,301 --> 00:16:31,516
He was close to the late Pope. Understood?

157
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:36,857
Look, I dont study symbols because I consider them unimportant.
Ceremony, traditions, heavily mark our lives.

158
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:40,226
- I just hope I can help.
- So do I.

159
00:16:40,981 --> 00:16:43,048
You were my idea.

160
00:16:53,787 --> 00:16:55,862
Wait here. Please.

161
00:16:59,475 --> 00:17:01,603
Commander? Commander Richter?

162
00:17:08,968 --> 00:17:10,828
Doctor Vetra?

163
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:16,030
I'm Commander Richter, principal of the Swiss Guard.
Thank you for coming.

164
00:17:16,231 --> 00:17:17,415
Hello.

165
00:17:17,675 --> 00:17:20,076
Oh. Professor Langdon.

166
00:17:20,382 --> 00:17:22,932
What a relief. The symbologist is here.

167
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:24,920
This way, please, Miss Vetra.

168
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:28,448
The situation has changed.

169
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,850
We received another threat from the kidnapper.

170
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,506
The canister was stolen from my lab around noon yesterday.

171
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:40,748
The intruder killed my research partner, Silvano Paintivolio
and mutilated him in order to bypass security.

172
00:17:41,399 --> 00:17:43,147
We use retinal scanners.

173
00:17:43,944 --> 00:17:45,839
They cut out his eye.

174
00:17:46,886 --> 00:17:49,411
Is that your stolen canister, Ms. Vetra?

175
00:17:50,311 --> 00:17:53,200
- Where is that camera, number 86?
- It's wireless.

176
00:17:53,223 --> 00:17:55,700
It, too, was stolen. It could be anywhere
inside the Vatican walls.

177
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:58,996
That canister contains an extremely combustible
substance called antimatter.

178
00:17:58,997 --> 00:18:02,000
We need to locate it immediately.
We evacuate Vatican City.

179
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,607
I'm quite familiar with incendiaries, Miss Vetra.

180
00:18:04,608 --> 00:18:09,666
- I've never heard of antimatter being used as such.
- Well, its never been generated in significant quantities before.

181
00:18:09,745 --> 00:18:15,488
It's a way of studying the origins of the universe.
To try to isolate what some people call "the God Particle".

182
00:18:15,489 --> 00:18:19,211
- But there are implications for energy, research...
- "God Particle"?

183
00:18:20,674 --> 00:18:22,603
What you call it isn't important.

184
00:18:22,605 --> 00:18:26,109
It's what gives all matter mass.
The thing without which we could not exist.

185
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:31,290
- You're talking about the moment of creation.
- Yes, in a way, I am.

186
00:18:31,514 --> 00:18:33,490
The antimatter is suspended there...

187
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,000
in an airtight nano-composite shell with
electromagnets on each end.

188
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:41,856
But if it were to fall out of suspension, and come into contact
with matter, say with the bottom of the canister,

189
00:18:41,857 --> 00:18:45,203
then, the two opposing forces would
annihilate one another violently.

190
00:18:45,204 --> 00:18:47,543
What might cause it to fall out of suspension?

191
00:18:47,844 --> 00:18:49,237
The battery going dead.

192
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,852
Which it will just before midnight.

193
00:18:51,963 --> 00:18:55,988
- What kind of annihilation? How violent?
- A cataclysmic event.

194
00:18:56,043 --> 00:18:59,744
A blinding explosion equivalent to about 5 kilotons.

195
00:19:00,395 --> 00:19:03,890
Vatican City will be consumed by light.

196
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,916
Those are the exact words the kidnapper used.

197
00:19:08,288 --> 00:19:10,679
<i>We will destroy your four pillars.</i>

198
00:19:12,423 --> 00:19:17,468
<i>We will brand your Preferiti and sacrifice
them on the altars of science.</i>

199
00:19:18,022 --> 00:19:20,960
<i>Then bring your church down upon you.</i>

200
00:19:21,206 --> 00:19:23,921
<i>Vatican City will be consumed by light.</i>

201
00:19:24,433 --> 00:19:28,446
<i>A shining star at the end of the Path of Illumination.</i>

202
00:19:34,392 --> 00:19:38,224
It's the ancient Illuminati threat.
Destruction of Vatican City through light.

203
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,521
Four pillars. There's your kidnapped cardinals.

204
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:46,692
You didn't tell me they were the Preferiti,
the favorites to be named the next Pope.

205
00:19:49,353 --> 00:19:50,228
Play it again.

206
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,906
<i>We will destroy your four pillars.</i>

207
00:20:02,313 --> 00:20:03,747
<i>We will brand your Preferiti...</i>

208
00:20:03,748 --> 00:20:04,715
Wait, stop it. Stop.

209
00:20:07,111 --> 00:20:08,144
Brand them?

210
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,372
That's another Illuminati legend.

211
00:20:13,392 --> 00:20:17,590
This one says that there are a set of five 'Brands'.

212
00:20:18,586 --> 00:20:19,882
Each one an ambigram.

213
00:20:19,974 --> 00:20:22,409
The first four are the fundamental elements of science:

214
00:20:22,504 --> 00:20:24,443
earth, air, fire and water.

215
00:20:24,662 --> 00:20:26,399
The fifth is a mystery.

216
00:20:29,276 --> 00:20:30,396
Maybe it's this.

217
00:20:31,462 --> 00:20:33,326
You said they'd be killed publicly.

218
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:37,112
Yes. Revenge. For La Purga.

219
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:39,329
La Purga?

220
00:20:40,848 --> 00:20:43,310
Geez, you guys don't even read your own history, do you?

221
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:53,090
1668. The church kidnapped four Illuminati scientists and branded
each one of them on the chest with the symbol of the cross.

222
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,588
To purge them of their sins and they executed them,

223
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,960
threw their bodies out in the street as a
warning to others to stop questioning

224
00:20:59,962 --> 00:21:06,325
church rulings on scientific matters. They radicalized them.
The Purga created a darker, more violent Illuminati.

225
00:21:06,327 --> 00:21:08,826
One bent on... on retribution.

226
00:21:09,592 --> 00:21:12,717
And look how they intend to finally get it. Using anti-matter.

227
00:21:12,785 --> 00:21:17,282
Technology to destroy the church.
Science obliterates religion.

228
00:21:18,425 --> 00:21:19,411
Is there any more?

229
00:21:21,529 --> 00:21:24,054
<i>and sacrifice them on the altars of science.</i>

230
00:21:24,704 --> 00:21:26,934
<i>Then bring your church down upon you.</i>

231
00:21:27,898 --> 00:21:30,588
<i>Vatican City will be consumed by light.</i>

232
00:21:31,137 --> 00:21:35,173
<i>A shining star at the end of the Path of Illumination.</i>

233
00:21:35,273 --> 00:21:36,724
Path of Illumination?

234
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,449
I need access to the Vatican archives.

235
00:21:44,657 --> 00:21:48,862
- Professor, I don't think this is the appropriate moment...
- Your petition has been denied seven times.

236
00:21:48,863 --> 00:21:50,667
No, no. This has... This has nothing to do with my work.

237
00:21:50,698 --> 00:21:55,576
The Path of Illumination is a hidden trail through Rome itself
that leads to the Church of the Illumination.

238
00:21:55,678 --> 00:21:58,055
The place where the Illuminati would meet in secret.

239
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:03,728
If I can find the "Segno", the sign,
that marks the beginning of that path,

240
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,100
the four churches along it. It may be where he
intends to murder your Cardinals.

241
00:22:08,474 --> 00:22:13,709
One every hour. At 8, 9, 10 and 11.
Then the device explodes at midnight.

242
00:22:14,427 --> 00:22:18,612
If we could figure out the first church and get there
before he does, maybe we could stop it.

243
00:22:18,613 --> 00:22:22,580
But I can't find the start of the path
until I get into the archives.

244
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,192
Even if I wanted to help you,

245
00:22:25,551 --> 00:22:30,333
access to the archives is only by written decree
by the curator on the Board of Vatican Librarians.

246
00:22:30,957 --> 00:22:32,590
Or by papal mandate.

247
00:22:32,663 --> 00:22:35,672
Yes, but, as you no doubt have heard, the Holy Father is dead.

248
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,507
What about il Camerlengo?

249
00:22:38,508 --> 00:22:41,483
The Camerlengo is just a priest here.
The former pope's chamberlain.

250
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:45,112
Doesn't the power of the Holy See rest
in him during "Tempo Sede Vacante"?

251
00:22:53,132 --> 00:22:55,393
Fellas, you called me.

252
00:22:57,499 --> 00:23:02,248
His Holiness once told me the Pope is a man torn
between the real world and the divine.

253
00:23:02,934 --> 00:23:05,293
It seems the real world is upon us tonight.

254
00:23:06,864 --> 00:23:09,936
I'm familiar with Illuminati lore and the legend of the brandings.

255
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:13,402
The Purga is a dark stain on this church's history.

256
00:23:13,956 --> 00:23:16,560
I'm not surprised this ghost has returned to haunt us.

257
00:23:19,085 --> 00:23:22,365
Commandante, have you begun a search
for this explosive device?

258
00:23:22,582 --> 00:23:24,135
Of course, but it could be anywhere.

259
00:23:24,293 --> 00:23:26,684
My primary concern at the moment
is the safety of the cardinals.

260
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,561
The Sistine Chapel is a fortress.

261
00:23:29,707 --> 00:23:33,522
As long as the cardinals are in conclave,
your security concerns are at a minimum.

262
00:23:33,598 --> 00:23:37,001
- Devote as many of your people...
- Signore, if you are about to suggest a naked eye search

263
00:23:37,002 --> 00:23:38,896
of the entire Vatican City, I will tell you...

264
00:23:38,897 --> 00:23:40,114
- Commander.
- I do not have the people.

265
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:42,279
Although I am not His Holiness,

266
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,834
when you are addressing me, you are addressing this office.

267
00:23:44,835 --> 00:23:46,366
Do you understand?

268
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,253
- Yes, Father.
- Good.

269
00:23:51,706 --> 00:23:54,953
Now, you said the image on the screen
was illuminated by artificial light.

270
00:23:56,023 --> 00:23:59,709
Might I suggest methodically cutting
power to various sections of the city?

271
00:24:00,423 --> 00:24:04,690
When the image on the screen goes dark, you'll have
a more specific idea of the camera's location.

272
00:24:08,384 --> 00:24:14,111
Dr. Vetra, beside yourself and your research partner,
who else knew about this antimatter project?

273
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:16,866
No one but the research team.

274
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,605
This project was strictly confidential.

275
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,641
But Silvano kept detailed journals.

276
00:24:21,642 --> 00:24:26,222
If he told anyone else about what we were doing,
he would have made a note of it.

277
00:24:26,372 --> 00:24:27,761
And do you have these journals?

278
00:24:27,847 --> 00:24:30,093
I can have them flown here from Geneva in an hour.

279
00:24:30,327 --> 00:24:31,530
Please.

280
00:24:33,173 --> 00:24:34,324
Professor Langdon.

281
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,412
Mr. Langdon.

282
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:50,585
You are correct that I may grant you access to the archives.

283
00:24:53,162 --> 00:24:54,110
Thank you, Padre.

284
00:24:54,225 --> 00:24:57,987
I said that you are correct that I may,
not... not that I will.

285
00:25:00,086 --> 00:25:03,140
Christianity's most sacred codes are in that archive.

286
00:25:04,306 --> 00:25:07,220
Given your recent entanglement with the church,

287
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:11,781
there is a question I'd like to ask you first,
here, in the office of His Holiness.

288
00:25:19,235 --> 00:25:20,877
Do you believe in God, Sir?

289
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:27,643
Father, I simply believe that religion...

290
00:25:27,644 --> 00:25:30,836
I did not ask you if you believe what man says about God.

291
00:25:31,336 --> 00:25:33,173
I asked if you believe in God.

292
00:25:36,057 --> 00:25:37,553
I'm an academic.

293
00:25:38,665 --> 00:25:43,277
My mind tells me I will never understand God.

294
00:25:44,266 --> 00:25:45,405
And your heart?

295
00:25:48,317 --> 00:25:50,377
Tells me I'm not meant to.

296
00:25:51,934 --> 00:25:55,380
Faith is a gift that I have yet to receive.

297
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,847
Be delicate with our treasures.

298
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:13,087
- The archives are this way.
- Professor Langdon?

299
00:26:15,065 --> 00:26:20,204
If this path really leads to the Church of Illumination,
that may be where they've hidden the antimatter.

300
00:26:20,235 --> 00:26:22,053
The shining star at the end of the path. I thought so, too.

301
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:25,375
Follow the path and we may find the canister at the end of it.

302
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:26,500
Can you deactivate the device?

303
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:29,960
I can change the canister's batteries as long
as we have more than five minutes of life.

304
00:26:29,962 --> 00:26:33,612
That would give us another 24 hours
to get it safely back to CERN.

305
00:26:36,276 --> 00:26:39,000
- Robert Langdon.
- Vittoria Vetra.

306
00:26:39,259 --> 00:26:42,645
Are you really a symbologist or was he mocking you?

307
00:26:42,825 --> 00:26:44,822
No. Both. You're a physicist?

308
00:26:45,025 --> 00:26:48,095
Bioentanglement Physics.
The interconnective life systems?

309
00:26:48,095 --> 00:26:49,096
Okay.

310
00:26:49,683 --> 00:26:52,556
Your project... it was to give towards the energy research?

311
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:53,724
Eventually, yes.

312
00:26:54,026 --> 00:26:57,463
One pack of antimatter could power an entire city for a month.

313
00:26:58,281 --> 00:26:59,996
Or tonight, I guess, destroy one.

314
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,215
- What are we looking for in the archives?
- A banned volume written by Galileo.

315
00:27:05,364 --> 00:27:09,314
- Galileo was Illuminati?
- Yeah, and an obedient Catholic.

316
00:27:09,488 --> 00:27:13,822
Who didn't think the church and science were enemies
but just a different language telling the same story.

317
00:27:13,823 --> 00:27:16,158
Anyone of like minds could find the Church of Illumination.

318
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,181
But he couldn't exactly advertise its location,
so he created a coded path.

319
00:27:22,482 --> 00:27:25,212
Richter has started to turn off the power at various rates.

320
00:27:25,215 --> 00:27:26,854
It will be back on in a minute.

321
00:27:27,837 --> 00:27:31,368
Then some unknown Illuminati master sculpted four statues.

322
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:34,400
Each one a tribute to one of the fundamental elements:

323
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:36,292
earth, air, fire, water.

324
00:27:36,292 --> 00:27:39,443
And placed the statues out in public,
in churches throughout Rome.

325
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:42,403
Each statue held a clue pointing to the next.

326
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:47,112
At the end of the path was the Church of Illumination.
If you could find that, you were one of them.

327
00:27:48,256 --> 00:27:51,110
What makes you think he's going to murder
the cardinals in the churches?

328
00:27:51,248 --> 00:27:55,823
The Illuminati called those four churches by the special name,
"L'altare de la Scienza".

329
00:27:57,164 --> 00:27:59,418
Sacrifice them on the altars of science, he said.

330
00:28:00,126 --> 00:28:01,323
Exactly.

331
00:28:04,579 --> 00:28:07,097
Oh, wow. Look at this.

332
00:28:31,473 --> 00:28:33,469
Excuse me. Signori.

333
00:28:35,408 --> 00:28:38,205
Cardinal Strauss, have you been informed of the situation?

334
00:28:38,206 --> 00:28:38,950
Yeah.

335
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,578
My belief is we should proceed with the sealing of conclave.

336
00:28:43,886 --> 00:28:45,447
At this late hour?

337
00:28:45,816 --> 00:28:47,299
That would be highly unorthodox.

338
00:28:47,304 --> 00:28:50,712
And, yet, was ensured to wrought my power in great elective.

339
00:28:50,755 --> 00:28:52,639
The cruelest honor in Christendom.

340
00:28:52,942 --> 00:28:55,903
I have no personal ambitions, Patrick.

341
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,783
Only those I hold for my church.

342
00:28:58,889 --> 00:29:03,380
St. Peter's church, which is someday taken
at its most vulnerable moment.

343
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,108
And this is not a coincidence.

344
00:29:05,109 --> 00:29:08,594
The church will not fall in a day.
We must evacuate Vatican City.

345
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:12,594
That is exactly what they want. Publicity and panic.

346
00:29:12,803 --> 00:29:16,186
No. We must not give them oxygen for the media fire.

347
00:29:17,107 --> 00:29:23,120
- But the people in St. Peter's Square?
- Care deeply about their church, as we do.

348
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,584
Their faith will sustain them.

349
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:28,157
Their faith will not protect them from an explosion.

350
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:33,495
We are all bound for heaven eventually, are we not?

351
00:29:34,364 --> 00:29:37,644
Spoken like one who has enjoyed the
blessings of a long and full life.

352
00:29:37,805 --> 00:29:39,062
Patrick,

353
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:45,756
do not confuse the power of the office you temporarily
hold with your true place here at the Vatican.

354
00:29:47,275 --> 00:29:49,510
You were a favorite of His Holiness.

355
00:29:49,935 --> 00:29:54,088
But His Holiness is with his father now.

356
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,083
Mea culpa.

357
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,406
Seal the doors.

358
00:30:13,481 --> 00:30:15,578
Everyone outside.

359
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,505
This way, please.

360
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:11,337
Oh. Beautiful.

361
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,671
The chambers are hermetic vaults.

362
00:31:17,706 --> 00:31:21,800
Oxygen is kept at the lowest possible level.
It is a partial vacuum inside.

363
00:31:21,808 --> 00:31:24,220
So, extended stays are not recommended.

364
00:31:24,736 --> 00:31:28,088
So, don't panic if you feel light headed at first.

365
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:43,934
I'll be just outside the door, watching you, Mr. Langdon.

366
00:32:30,503 --> 00:32:33,290
Conclave will go on without us.

367
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:36,470
It must. Now of all times.

368
00:32:36,885 --> 00:32:39,691
May God forgive you for what you have done.

369
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,777
Father, if God has issues,

370
00:32:50,207 --> 00:32:52,267
they won't be with what I've done.

371
00:32:53,433 --> 00:32:55,960
They will be with what I'm about to do.

372
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:22,170
It was confiscated from the Netherlands
by the Vatican just after Galileo died.

373
00:33:22,205 --> 00:33:27,200
I've been petitioning to see it for about ten years.
Ever since I realized what was in it.

374
00:33:27,201 --> 00:33:30,563
- What makes you so sure that this thing is there?
- The number 503.

375
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:34,920
I kept seeing it, over and over again. In Illuminati letters.

376
00:33:34,921 --> 00:33:38,424
Scribbled in the margins. Sometimes just signed '503'.

377
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,040
It's a numeric clue, but, to what? Five?

378
00:33:41,042 --> 00:33:42,813
Well, that's a medieval number to the Illuminati.

379
00:33:43,357 --> 00:33:46,364
There's the pentagram. Pythagoras.
Dozens of other examples in science.

380
00:33:46,466 --> 00:33:47,699
But what about 3?

381
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,703
It didn't make sense, until I thought:
What if it's Roman numerals?

382
00:33:50,807 --> 00:33:54,343
- DIII.
- D3. Galileo's third text.

383
00:33:54,878 --> 00:33:58,475
Dialogo. Discorso. Diagramma.

384
00:34:10,597 --> 00:34:13,748
Just a few days with this and I could've
actually finished my book.

385
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,179
And sold dozens of copies at the Harvard bookstore.

386
00:34:17,914 --> 00:34:19,308
Il Diagramma Veritatis.

387
00:34:20,446 --> 00:34:21,552
Diagram of Truth.

388
00:34:22,657 --> 00:34:24,405
I know about the Dialogo and the Discorsi.

389
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:28,333
Galileo laid out his theories about the earth
revolving around the sun.

390
00:34:28,368 --> 00:34:32,500
Right. It said the earth was not the center of some
universe with heaven above, hell below,

391
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:36,293
- as the church had said it was.
- So, they forced him to recant his second book.

392
00:34:36,294 --> 00:34:38,962
- But what was this one?
- This is how he got the word out.

393
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,605
This is the truth. Not what the Vatican forced him to write.

394
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:45,280
Smuggled out of Rome, printed in Holland on setched papyrus. See?

395
00:34:45,675 --> 00:34:51,672
That way, any scientist that was caught with a copy could just
throw it in water and Galileo's heresy would disolve. Disappear.

396
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:54,843
Between that and Vatican burnings

397
00:34:54,847 --> 00:34:58,000
it's possible this is the only copy that remains.

398
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,072
And if I'm correct,

399
00:35:00,321 --> 00:35:04,764
the segno is hidden on page number...

400
00:35:04,971 --> 00:35:06,046
Five.

401
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:08,372
Yeah.

402
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,442
Do you need help with the Latin?

403
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:18,239
Sure.

404
00:35:25,064 --> 00:35:29,870
Movement of the planets, elliptical orbits, idiosyntricity...

405
00:35:32,402 --> 00:35:35,948
Sorry. I don't think there's anything that could be interpreted as a...

406
00:35:35,949 --> 00:35:36,959
Wait, wait, wait.

407
00:35:37,515 --> 00:35:38,696
Do that again.

408
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,013
What is that?

409
00:35:44,965 --> 00:35:47,684
Wait. It's a watermark. And there's a line of text.

410
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:49,127
Go back.

411
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,982
- It's in English.
- English?

412
00:35:54,107 --> 00:35:55,369
Why English?

413
00:35:55,752 --> 00:35:58,543
English wasn't used in the Vatican. It was too polluted.

414
00:35:58,649 --> 00:36:04,086
It's free thinking. It was the language of radicals,
like Shakespeare and Chaucer.

415
00:36:04,191 --> 00:36:04,948
Here's another one.

416
00:36:05,051 --> 00:36:09,872
"The path of light is laid a sacred test."
Would you write this down as I dictate?

417
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:11,875
Sorry, Professor. No time.

418
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,031
Yeah, yeah.
Well, what the hell? Yeah.

419
00:36:34,966 --> 00:36:36,994
Twenty minutes till eight.
Where are we headed?

420
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:38,857
Hold on. Hold on.
I'll tell you in a minute.

421
00:36:38,858 --> 00:36:40,478
Here. Let me see that page again.

422
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:48,222
Where did you get that paper?

423
00:36:48,882 --> 00:36:50,209
We borrowed it.

424
00:36:50,245 --> 00:36:53,507
"From Santi's earthly tomb, the demon's hole..."

425
00:36:53,508 --> 00:36:54,381
Are you insane?

426
00:36:54,382 --> 00:36:57,514
"across Rome the mystic elements unfold."

427
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:01,249
"The path of light is laid in a sacred test."

428
00:37:01,684 --> 00:37:04,253
"Let angels guide thee on thy lofty quest."

429
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:07,934
You removed a document from the Vatican archives?

430
00:37:08,816 --> 00:37:09,990
She did.

431
00:37:14,658 --> 00:37:16,628
"From Santi's earthly tomb..."

432
00:37:16,932 --> 00:37:19,318
- The first marker is at Santi's tomb.
- Yeah.

433
00:37:20,092 --> 00:37:22,134
- But who's Santi?
- Raphael.

434
00:37:22,138 --> 00:37:24,863
- Raphael? The sculptor?
- Yeah. Santi was his last name.

435
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,834
- So, the path starts at Raphael's tomb?
- Raphael's buried at the Pantheon.

436
00:37:29,384 --> 00:37:32,393
- Isn't the Pantheon a church?
- The oldest Catholic church in Rome.

437
00:37:51,818 --> 00:37:54,298
I just pulled a dozen of my best men for this.

438
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:56,136
You better be right.

439
00:37:55,939 --> 00:37:59,888
This is one of the busiest spot in all of Rome.
You can never get away with it. It's impossible.

440
00:37:59,889 --> 00:38:03,370
- The poem implies...
- The poem? Unbelievable.

441
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:07,817
I'm basing this operation on an American's
interpretation of a 400 year old poem.

442
00:38:08,021 --> 00:38:12,690
Well, the information we have clearly refers to Raphael's tomb
and Raphael's tomb is inside that building.

443
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:16,996
And because the Vatican destroyed all of the
pagan statues in the late 1800s,

444
00:38:17,198 --> 00:38:20,616
if this is the first marker, whatever clues were here
to lead us to the next are sure gone by now.

445
00:38:20,617 --> 00:38:23,044
The path is dead. So, this is it. Your only chance.

446
00:38:25,767 --> 00:38:27,224
Seperate approaches.

447
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:30,242
No closer than two blocks and no uniforms. Three minutes.

448
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,926
I'll need a set of eyes inside.

449
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,127
Excuse me.

450
00:38:38,128 --> 00:38:41,796
Two men with symmetric black suits and earpieces?
They're hardly disguised.

451
00:38:41,797 --> 00:38:43,624
- That's what I have.
- Well, fine. I'll go in.

452
00:38:43,626 --> 00:38:44,776
You don't have communication.

453
00:38:44,777 --> 00:38:46,868
You can't carry a walkie talkie.
It's too conspicuous.

454
00:38:46,869 --> 00:38:50,580
- Tourists have cell phones, don't they?
- No, no. You can't send her in there alone.

455
00:38:52,249 --> 00:38:53,633
All right. I won't.

456
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:07,565
Don't look so anxious.
We're supposed to be married.

457
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,100
Well, maybe we're not getting along today, hmm?

458
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:14,233
Hold my hand.

459
00:39:16,196 --> 00:39:18,413
- But don't crush it.
- Sorry.

460
00:39:18,787 --> 00:39:20,432
Nervous newlywed.

461
00:39:23,539 --> 00:39:25,925
Ooh. Look, honey. The oculus.

462
00:39:26,425 --> 00:39:30,444
- That could be the demon's hole in the poem.
- Why are the tombs at an angle?

463
00:39:31,038 --> 00:39:33,355
They're facing east to worship the rising sun.

464
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,709
But this is a Christian church.

465
00:39:34,713 --> 00:39:39,666
New religions often adopt the existing customs and
holidays to make conversion less of a shock.

466
00:39:40,477 --> 00:39:42,334
Like the 25th of December.

467
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:47,555
It's the pagan celebration of the unconquered sun.
It also makes a handy date for the birth of Christ.

468
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,199
- Let's check the recesses.
- Okay.

469
00:39:49,267 --> 00:39:52,103
I'll go to the right and I'll meet you in 180 degrees.

470
00:39:54,318 --> 00:39:56,117
Follow me, please.

471
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:00,225
Now, the Pantheon, which means 'Temple of all Gods',

472
00:40:00,226 --> 00:40:06,637
was originally built as a temple to all
the gods of ancient Rome in 27 BC.

473
00:40:06,702 --> 00:40:12,157
Although the building is usually credited
to Agrippa of Damascus...

474
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:14,146
Robert!

475
00:40:16,467 --> 00:40:18,078
Robert!

476
00:40:21,422 --> 00:40:23,960
It's Raphael's tomb, but it's the wrong one.

477
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,168
What are you talking about?

478
00:40:25,169 --> 00:40:28,925
It was moved here in 1759, a century
after Diagramma was published.

479
00:40:29,642 --> 00:40:30,703
Where was he originally buried?

480
00:40:31,577 --> 00:40:33,240
Urbino, I think.

481
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:36,520
Santi's earthly tomb.
What could posssibly be Santi's earthly tomb?

482
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,757
Damn it! Santi's tomb. It must mean the chapel that he built.

483
00:40:43,761 --> 00:40:45,390
He's not buried in it. He designed it.

484
00:40:45,393 --> 00:40:49,816
The demon's hole. It's not that oculus.
It's an undercroft. It's a crypt.

485
00:40:49,817 --> 00:40:50,891
Are there any questions?

486
00:40:51,036 --> 00:40:53,030
Yes. Yes!

487
00:40:53,817 --> 00:40:59,999
Did Raphael Santi ever design a chapel with an ossuary anex
in an angel figure commissioned by the Catholic church?

488
00:41:01,658 --> 00:41:03,891
I'm sorry. I can only think of one.

489
00:41:05,201 --> 00:41:06,552
One is good.

490
00:41:06,895 --> 00:41:11,368
- Wrong? What do you mean wrong?
- It's the Chigi chapel in the Church of Santa Maria del Popolo.

491
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,815
It was once called Capella della Terra, the Chapel of the Earth.

492
00:41:14,819 --> 00:41:17,317
Earth. The first element. That's it.

493
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,704
- You're certain about the Pantheon?
- We have four minutes.

494
00:41:19,708 --> 00:41:22,598
Back to the Vatican.

495
00:41:23,183 --> 00:41:24,670
Back to the Vatican? You... You can't.

496
00:41:24,771 --> 00:41:27,222
Commandante, if you care at all about your church,
you'll listen to me.

497
00:41:27,226 --> 00:41:28,373
My church?

498
00:41:30,653 --> 00:41:32,936
My church comforts the sick and dying.

499
00:41:32,943 --> 00:41:36,656
My church feeds the hungry.
What does your church do, Mr. Langdon?

500
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,679
That's right. You don't have one.

501
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,339
Take him if you want. I'm done with him.

502
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,700
All right, this makes sense.
Look, look, look!

503
00:41:57,701 --> 00:41:59,265
Right in front of the church.

504
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,144
An obelisk. A lofty pyramid.

505
00:42:01,147 --> 00:42:03,524
The Egyptian symbol adopted by the Illuminati.

506
00:42:03,737 --> 00:42:05,859
If he's going to kill him, he'll do it here.

507
00:42:22,648 --> 00:42:23,678
Eight o'clock.

508
00:42:51,905 --> 00:42:54,543
No. No. Here. It's an Annulus.

509
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,333
Which one is the Chigi Chapel?

510
00:43:23,812 --> 00:43:25,816
Must be in one of these areas.

511
00:44:30,017 --> 00:44:32,132
Pyramids in a Catholic church.

512
00:44:32,367 --> 00:44:35,593
This is it. This is the Chigi Chapel.

513
00:44:53,267 --> 00:44:54,914
The Demon's Hole.

514
00:44:58,343 --> 00:45:00,906
Yeah, but it's askew. Come here.

515
00:45:07,852 --> 00:45:09,764
Give me your flashlight.

516
00:45:10,382 --> 00:45:11,525
What's that?

517
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:10,247
My Savior Christ will be my judge, to testify that my voice is His.

518
00:46:10,248 --> 00:46:15,444
For I believe that He should be chosen for the sake of God.

519
00:46:38,173 --> 00:46:43,555
I wish to Pontifex, Dominicus Scolamiero.

520
00:46:53,364 --> 00:46:57,777
I wish to Pontifex, Eduardo Rossi.

521
00:46:58,787 --> 00:47:01,633
They are voting for themselves to prevent a majority.

522
00:47:02,064 --> 00:47:05,345
They're waiting for the Preferiti to be rescued.

523
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:08,900
Perhaps we should, as well, yes?

524
00:47:27,104 --> 00:47:32,222
Not until the smoke is white will the College of Cardinals
have chosen a new Holy Father.

525
00:47:32,414 --> 00:47:36,057
For now the Vatican seat of ultimate power remains vacant.

526
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:45,322
Get the body out of there.
Search the rest of the building.

527
00:47:45,342 --> 00:47:47,100
- Chartrand!
- Sir.

528
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,364
Outside a perimeter. Secure, but invisible.

529
00:47:49,365 --> 00:47:51,760
No lights, no guns. Nobody knows.
Understand?

530
00:47:51,761 --> 00:47:52,701
Yes, sir.

531
00:47:56,995 --> 00:47:58,343
Is it Raphael?

532
00:47:59,495 --> 00:48:00,992
The chapel is Raphael.

533
00:48:02,015 --> 00:48:03,918
But the sculptures are Bernini.

534
00:48:07,072 --> 00:48:09,363
The unknown Illuminati master?

535
00:48:10,965 --> 00:48:12,298
Bernini?

536
00:48:13,345 --> 00:48:16,518
- He worked for the church.
- Almost exclusively.

537
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:20,400
But the Illuminati were infiltrators.

538
00:48:21,392 --> 00:48:26,940
There wasn't a powerful organization on earth they didn't penetrate,
including the Vatican, by hiding in plain sight.

539
00:48:31,543 --> 00:48:33,319
Habakkuk and the Angel.

540
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,999
He's the prophet that predicted the annihilation of the earth.

541
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,016
"Let angels guide thee on thy lofty quest."

542
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,214
This is the first marker.

543
00:48:46,908 --> 00:48:48,019
The path is a line.

544
00:49:00,608 --> 00:49:02,063
Southwest.

545
00:49:02,664 --> 00:49:03,978
It was pointing southwest.

546
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:06,745
Earth, air, fire, water.

547
00:49:06,746 --> 00:49:09,200
We're looking for a Bernini sculpture
having something to do with air.

548
00:49:09,202 --> 00:49:11,811
The second church is somewhere southwest of here.

549
00:49:12,246 --> 00:49:13,551
You're sure this time?

550
00:49:13,886 --> 00:49:16,578
I need a map showing all the churches of Rome.

551
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:21,373
I could use it now.

552
00:49:56,487 --> 00:49:59,492
The purple layers with these black
crosses represent the churches.

553
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:03,447
But nothing intersects the line until it hits...
until it hits St. Peter's.

554
00:50:03,452 --> 00:50:05,681
Michelangelo designed St. Peter's, not Bernini.

555
00:50:05,684 --> 00:50:09,354
Michelangelo designed the Basilica.
Bernini designed St. Peter's Square.

556
00:50:09,488 --> 00:50:12,601
The second marker must be a statue in St. Peter's Square.

557
00:50:17,893 --> 00:50:20,209
It's ten minutes to nine.
Can you go any faster?

558
00:50:20,577 --> 00:50:23,535
Not unless you want the full attention of the world press.

559
00:50:31,771 --> 00:50:38,800
No majority in the first vote, but Cardinal Baggia
from Italy is the clear favorite...

560
00:50:40,397 --> 00:50:47,216
Still no new Pope, but Cardinal Guidera
from Spain has the best chance...

561
00:50:47,218 --> 00:50:53,470
The more conceivable candidate could
be Cardinal Ebner from Germany...

562
00:50:54,439 --> 00:50:57,039
Stem cell research is murder!

563
00:50:58,212 --> 00:51:00,521
You condemn sick people to death.

564
00:51:00,828 --> 00:51:02,580
Man is not God.

565
00:51:14,692 --> 00:51:16,248
There. Another obelisk.

566
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:19,109
Check the crowd. It's almost nine.
He's got to be here already.

567
00:51:53,029 --> 00:51:55,218
Must be a hundred statues up there.

568
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:58,853
None of them are angels.
Those are all saints.

569
00:51:59,095 --> 00:52:03,331
How in God's name would anyone create a sculpture about air?

570
00:52:10,802 --> 00:52:12,233
Bas relief. Of course.

571
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,966
It's still a sculpture. Check the ground.
Look at the carvings.

572
00:52:16,346 --> 00:52:18,109
Look for another having something to do with air.

573
00:52:38,924 --> 00:52:40,600
Vento Ponente. West wind.

574
00:52:42,502 --> 00:52:43,480
Vittoria.

575
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:44,965
Here it is.

576
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,953
West wind. An angel blowing out five streaks of air.

577
00:52:49,161 --> 00:52:50,235
This is it.

578
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,187
Call the police!

579
00:53:54,568 --> 00:53:56,199
Call an ambulance!

580
00:54:05,843 --> 00:54:06,905
He's still alive.

581
00:54:21,141 --> 00:54:24,186
His chest.
They punctured his lungs.

582
00:55:41,111 --> 00:55:43,109
"And you squeezed the life out of a bishop of Rome."

583
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:46,355
And he's actually claiming responsibility
for the death of His Holiness.

584
00:55:46,522 --> 00:55:48,311
That's ridiculous. He died of a stroke.

585
00:55:49,406 --> 00:55:52,297
It impliess the Illuminati murdered him with his own medication.

586
00:55:52,731 --> 00:55:53,447
What?

587
00:55:55,043 --> 00:55:56,109
It's on here.

588
00:55:56,666 --> 00:55:59,219
"With man's solution we stilled his heart."

589
00:56:00,069 --> 00:56:03,220
"With his own needle did we pierce his unholy vein."

590
00:56:03,556 --> 00:56:06,991
Did the Holy Father take any kind of medication by injection?

591
00:56:07,075 --> 00:56:07,892
Tinzaparin.

592
00:56:09,105 --> 00:56:10,668
He had thrombophlebitis.

593
00:56:10,931 --> 00:56:13,506
He took an injection every day, but no one knew that.

594
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:15,008
Someone knew it.

595
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,801
Well, he had health concerns and seizures, as well.

596
00:56:18,603 --> 00:56:22,200
But he took steps to make sure he was watched for safety.

597
00:56:22,201 --> 00:56:25,003
He didn't want it made public,
so we have no reason to discuss it.

598
00:56:25,085 --> 00:56:27,287
Tinzaparin is lethal in the wrong dosage.

599
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,483
An overdose could cause massive internal
bleeding and brain hemorrhages.

600
00:56:31,933 --> 00:56:35,614
It might look like a stroke at first, but in few days,
his body would show signs.

601
00:56:35,701 --> 00:56:36,852
This could easily be examined.

602
00:56:36,953 --> 00:56:41,888
Ms. Vetra, in case you're not aware of it Papal
autopsy is prohibited by Vatican law.

603
00:56:42,289 --> 00:56:45,969
We're not going to defile his Holiness body
just because of these claims.

604
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:47,419
But why would they send this letter now?

605
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:48,978
In order to cause panic.

606
00:56:49,348 --> 00:56:54,444
"The sun will blind at midnight and neither
police nor professors can stop it."

607
00:56:54,895 --> 00:56:56,125
He knows I'm here.

608
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:58,708
Obviously, they were hoping this letter would become public.

609
00:56:59,027 --> 00:57:02,677
We might be wise to preempt their next attempt
by making an announcement of our own.

610
00:57:02,751 --> 00:57:05,723
- To refute this absurd claim.
- That's out of the question.

611
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:09,208
Cardinal Strauss has insisted this entire matter be kept internal.

612
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,471
He shouldn't even be aware of it.
He's locked in conclave.

613
00:57:11,531 --> 00:57:15,220
His final instructions, before sealing the doors, were very clear.

614
00:57:15,551 --> 00:57:18,482
Cardinal Strauss does not dictate Vatican protocols.

615
00:57:18,857 --> 00:57:25,655
And to say, yet, technically, now that conclave has begun,
it is privilege and duty to control public announcements.

616
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:31,562
I've drafted a press release about the incident at the piazza,
but any other statements are specifically prohibited.

617
00:57:31,757 --> 00:57:36,621
For that, the cardinal has asked me
to remind you we have a chimney.

618
00:57:40,386 --> 00:57:42,300
Commander Richter, the search for the device?

619
00:57:43,055 --> 00:57:46,915
Well, we've turned the power on and off
to about twenty percent of Vatican city

620
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:49,290
- but nothing on the video yet.
- We're running out of options.

621
00:57:49,582 --> 00:57:51,305
How long would you need to evacuate everyone?

622
00:57:51,472 --> 00:57:54,422
If I pull all my men from the search
for the bomb, thirty minutes.

623
00:57:55,833 --> 00:57:58,620
Mr. Langdon, you have been right so far about the path.

624
00:57:58,621 --> 00:58:02,052
It's now 9:15.
How quickly can you find the next church?

625
00:58:02,241 --> 00:58:05,668
The lines of breath on the carving pointed
due east directly away from Vatican City.

626
00:58:05,669 --> 00:58:08,006
But there were five of them, so there's room for error.

627
00:58:08,183 --> 00:58:12,606
About twenty churches intersect those lines.
None of them have names that invoke fire.

628
00:58:12,751 --> 00:58:17,555
So, the Bernini sculpture must be inside one of them that does.
I'm willing to get back into the archives to find it.

629
00:58:17,568 --> 00:58:19,707
- Would you escort Mr Langdon?
- Yes, Father.

630
00:58:22,472 --> 00:58:25,287
Silvano's journals.
The killer's name could be in here.

631
00:58:26,145 --> 00:58:28,114
- May I stay?
- Please. Fine. Of course.

632
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,225
Professor.

633
00:58:32,962 --> 00:58:35,392
Would it surprise you to find those clothes suit you?

634
00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:38,533
It would surprise the hell out of me.

635
00:58:54,987 --> 00:58:58,430
The Vatican expressed its sympathy
with the families of the victim.

636
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:01,482
A tourist from Dsseldorf, whose death is confirmed.

637
00:59:01,977 --> 00:59:05,822
Vatican police have arrested a suspect...

638
00:59:06,069 --> 00:59:09,132
The investigation is completed.

639
00:59:09,236 --> 00:59:15,999
Vatican will permit access to St. Peter's again,
with strict security measures.

640
00:59:16,087 --> 00:59:19,759
The Vatican did admit that, where there
are crowds, so often follows crime.

641
00:59:20,222 --> 00:59:22,906
We're trying now to get the name of the tourist who was...

642
00:59:23,006 --> 00:59:24,196
But wait.

643
00:59:25,815 --> 00:59:27,682
<i>We're getting word now of smoke.</i>

644
00:59:27,775 --> 00:59:32,259
<i>Smoke from the Sistine Chapel chimney.
Apparently, there's been another vote.</i>

645
00:59:32,562 --> 00:59:34,051
<i>The smoke is black.</i>

646
00:59:34,235 --> 00:59:39,211
<i>Once again, the Cardinals have failed to reach consensus,
and the Catholic Church remains without a leader.</i>

647
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:49,156
What are you looking for now?

648
00:59:50,449 --> 00:59:52,900
- Church assets.
- I beg your pardon?

649
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:55,042
Artwork. It's valuable.

650
00:59:55,879 --> 00:59:58,192
Corporations tend to keep track of their holdings.

651
00:59:59,122 --> 01:00:02,525
The Catholic church is not a corporation. It's a beacon.

652
01:00:03,172 --> 01:00:08,555
- A source of inspiration for one billion lost and frightened souls.
- Sure, I get that. It's also a bank.

653
01:00:19,253 --> 01:00:22,133
Commander Olivetti said that I was
not to leave your side this time.

654
01:00:24,847 --> 01:00:26,441
It wasn't me. It was her.

655
01:00:43,975 --> 01:00:46,011
Power in zone 3 is disabled.

656
01:00:46,112 --> 01:00:48,028
No response on the screen.

657
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,426
Power on zone 3 again and continue with zone 4.

658
01:01:01,779 --> 01:01:02,977
What sort of signs?

659
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:05,635
I'm sorry?

660
01:01:09,727 --> 01:01:13,377
If the Holy Father was given an overdose of Tinzaparin,

661
01:01:14,236 --> 01:01:16,454
what signs would his body bear?

662
01:01:17,969 --> 01:01:19,713
Bleeding of the oral mucosa.

663
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,436
His tongue.

664
01:01:22,741 --> 01:01:26,756
Post-mortem, the blood congeals,
then turns the inside of the mouth black.

665
01:01:28,777 --> 01:01:30,528
Even after fourteen days?

666
01:01:30,766 --> 01:01:33,464
It wouldn't show up until at least a week after his death.

667
01:01:38,599 --> 01:01:40,076
He was very important to me.

668
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:43,924
Yeah, I understand.

669
01:01:49,033 --> 01:01:50,589
Will you come with me, please?

670
01:01:58,065 --> 01:02:02,444
Signore, would you organize a security team to escort
Ms. Vetra and myself down to the crypt?

671
01:02:02,549 --> 01:02:04,318
Yes, sir. We'll leave immediately.

672
01:02:23,442 --> 01:02:24,835
Do you smoke?

673
01:02:26,267 --> 01:02:27,879
A little bit.

674
01:02:28,395 --> 01:02:31,118
You better sit down before you keel over.

675
01:02:36,925 --> 01:02:41,775
What does this say in Italian?
Ecstasy of Saint Theresa. Right there.

676
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,985
Moved at suggestion of the artist.

677
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:51,329
Moved? To another church?
At the suggestion of Bernini?

678
01:02:51,765 --> 01:02:53,317
I don't know.

679
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:59,948
Here. Translate all of this for me, and
I'll buy you a pack of smokes.

680
01:02:59,955 --> 01:03:02,592
I'm looking for a reference of fire.

681
01:03:04,728 --> 01:03:07,535
- Seraphim, meaning "the fiery one".
- Right.

682
01:03:09,370 --> 01:03:13,921
His great golden spear. A point of fire.

683
01:03:15,332 --> 01:03:19,338
Then "woman left completely afire."

684
01:03:19,375 --> 01:03:23,301
The ecstasy of Saint Theresa.
Saint Theresa on fire.

685
01:03:23,306 --> 01:03:26,055
So, this sculpture was moved to this church?

686
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:30,566
Why are they shuting down the system?
They know we're down here.

687
01:03:31,051 --> 01:03:34,216
If there's no power, there's no oxygen.

688
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:37,783
- Can we get out?
- The door is electronic.

689
01:03:41,053 --> 01:03:43,207
Well, that's disappointing.

690
01:03:44,577 --> 01:03:47,571
- Where are we going?
- To see my father.

691
01:03:47,821 --> 01:03:49,102
I don't understand.

692
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:51,922
I was orphaned when I was nine years of age.

693
01:03:51,987 --> 01:03:56,453
A bombing in Ulster, the UVF protesting
the visit of a Catholic Archbishop.

694
01:03:56,860 --> 01:04:01,177
The Archbishop felt responsible and he
adopted me the following day.

695
01:04:01,538 --> 01:04:03,984
I was raised by him and by the Church.

696
01:04:04,554 --> 01:04:06,907
He was the wisest man I ever met.

697
01:04:07,568 --> 01:04:10,965
Even when I was young and stubborn,
I wanted to be ordained,

698
01:04:10,966 --> 01:04:14,541
but I was brought up in Italy so I also
wanted to do my military service.

699
01:04:14,546 --> 01:04:16,478
I wanted to fight.

700
01:04:16,715 --> 01:04:19,905
He told me, "Learn to fly."

701
01:04:19,938 --> 01:04:23,507
So, I joined the Aeronautica Militari.
Flew helicopters.

702
01:04:23,517 --> 01:04:25,819
Bringing the wounded back to hospitals.

703
01:04:26,024 --> 01:04:29,314
- He was a great man.
- Your father died.

704
01:04:30,179 --> 01:04:31,857
Fourteen days ago.

705
01:04:32,749 --> 01:04:34,644
Headquarters, you hear me?

706
01:04:34,782 --> 01:04:37,412
The flow is completed.
Oxygen level is very low.

707
01:04:37,413 --> 01:04:40,915
- Answer, please. Anybody hear me?
- Did you get anything?

708
01:04:40,916 --> 01:04:45,104
No. The walls are lead lined.
There's no signal.

709
01:07:59,535 --> 01:08:00,540
This way.

710
01:08:08,946 --> 01:08:12,626
If the Holy Father was murdered,
the implications are profound.

711
01:08:13,345 --> 01:08:15,254
Vatican security is impenetrable.

712
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:18,103
No one from the outside could've got anywhere near him.

713
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:22,392
- It was someone on the inside.
- We can trust no one.

714
01:08:24,272 --> 01:08:27,318
On my screen, no response in zone 7.

715
01:08:28,157 --> 01:08:31,339
We rechon that the battery will soon be empty

716
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:34,221
and the device will explode shortly before midnight.

717
01:08:56,251 --> 01:08:57,523
Holy Father...

718
01:08:58,663 --> 01:09:02,009
when I was young, you've told me the
voice in my heart was God's voice.

719
01:09:02,744 --> 01:09:05,467
You said I should follow it no matter how painful.

720
01:09:05,774 --> 01:09:06,834
Forgive me.

721
01:09:07,844 --> 01:09:10,369
Please, give me strength.

722
01:09:12,054 --> 01:09:16,065
What I do, I do in the name of everything you believed.

723
01:10:06,752 --> 01:10:08,287
God help us.

724
01:10:21,154 --> 01:10:23,321
Santa Maria della Vittoria.
Do you know it?

725
01:10:24,094 --> 01:10:26,207
- Yes, I do.
- It's the next church.

726
01:10:42,567 --> 01:10:44,521
I think someone just tried to kill me.

727
01:10:44,629 --> 01:10:46,317
Professor, I promise you, we had no idea.

728
01:10:46,318 --> 01:10:47,552
- He knows I'm here?
- Yes.

729
01:10:47,553 --> 01:10:49,437
You heard me ask permission.
You gave me an escort.

730
01:10:49,438 --> 01:10:53,604
Yes, but we had no idea that portions of our white zones
were crosswired with that building.

731
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,741
Commander Richter was extending the search.

732
01:10:56,743 --> 01:10:59,888
If he had known the archives were on that grid,
he never would have killed the power.

733
01:11:01,127 --> 01:11:03,087
But there is the other possibility.

734
01:11:03,571 --> 01:11:06,172
Is it conceivable the Illuminati...

735
01:11:07,019 --> 01:11:09,203
have infiltrated the Swiss Guard?

736
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:13,454
Perhaps.

737
01:11:23,492 --> 01:11:25,239
The journals. Where are they?

738
01:11:27,842 --> 01:11:29,867
Who took the journals from this desk?

739
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:42,795
Signore, this is unacceptable.

740
01:11:43,092 --> 01:11:46,372
For a Camerlengo to enter the chapel
once conclave has begun.

741
01:11:46,379 --> 01:11:47,656
Forgive me.

742
01:11:47,657 --> 01:11:49,479
There's been a development.

743
01:11:59,637 --> 01:12:02,673
His Holiness Celestine was murdered!

744
01:12:02,674 --> 01:12:05,720
- Is it so inconceivable that it will happen again?
- Signori.

745
01:12:06,290 --> 01:12:09,553
Signori, please, a moment.
Please. Signori.

746
01:12:12,153 --> 01:12:14,467
Our church is at war.

747
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:18,786
We are under attack from an old enemy.

748
01:12:19,145 --> 01:12:20,970
The Illuminati.

749
01:12:21,466 --> 01:12:23,386
They have struck us from within.

750
01:12:23,690 --> 01:12:26,086
Murdering our Holy Father!

751
01:12:26,221 --> 01:12:30,748
And threatening us all with destruction
at the hands of their new God 'Science'.

752
01:12:30,862 --> 01:12:34,109
They call it retribution.
They think it justified...

753
01:12:34,144 --> 01:12:38,291
because of the Church's attacks on men of
science in the distant past and it's true.

754
01:12:38,999 --> 01:12:44,064
Since the days of Galileo, this church has tried to
slow the relentless march of progress.

755
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:46,833
Sometimes with misguided means.

756
01:12:47,942 --> 01:12:50,134
But science and religion are not enemies.

757
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:56,220
There are simply some things that science
is just too young to understand.

758
01:12:56,650 --> 01:12:58,396
So the Church pleads, "Stop."

759
01:12:58,930 --> 01:13:00,191
"Slow down."

760
01:13:00,273 --> 01:13:01,721
"Think. Wait."

761
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:04,265
And, for this, they call us backwards.

762
01:13:04,884 --> 01:13:06,844
But who is more ignorant?

763
01:13:07,074 --> 01:13:09,178
The man who cannot define lightning...

764
01:13:09,341 --> 01:13:12,450
or the man who does not respect its natural awesome power?

765
01:13:13,539 --> 01:13:15,685
The battle is well under way, signori.

766
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:18,350
We must defend ourselves.

767
01:13:18,658 --> 01:13:21,127
But, what if this time, we fight their stealth with openness?

768
01:13:21,302 --> 01:13:23,989
Combat their wicked scheme with simple truth.

769
01:13:24,282 --> 01:13:27,133
And end this brutish battle once and for all.

770
01:13:27,328 --> 01:13:30,142
If the outside world could see this church as I do,

771
01:13:30,346 --> 01:13:32,241
looking beyond the ritual of these walls,

772
01:13:32,438 --> 01:13:35,172
they would see a modern miracle.

773
01:13:35,982 --> 01:13:38,753
A brotherhood of imperfect, simple souls...

774
01:13:38,996 --> 01:13:44,250
who want nothing more than to be voices of compassion
in a world spinning out of control.

775
01:13:46,149 --> 01:13:48,476
Signori, I ask..

776
01:13:50,544 --> 01:13:51,440
I pray...

777
01:13:52,679 --> 01:13:54,961
that you break this conclave.

778
01:13:55,473 --> 01:13:56,829
Open the doors,

779
01:13:57,979 --> 01:14:02,360
evacuate St. Peter's Square and tell the world the truth.

780
01:14:37,332 --> 01:14:38,936
Get him down.

781
01:14:50,617 --> 01:14:52,650
There. There, that chain. On that pulley.

782
01:14:52,677 --> 01:14:55,008
This bench. Get this pew off here and make it a ladder.

783
01:16:16,829 --> 01:16:18,129
Vatican Police.

784
01:17:20,764 --> 01:17:22,895
My son...

785
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:26,371
God answers all prayers, but...

786
01:17:27,173 --> 01:17:29,564
sometimes His answer is no.

787
01:17:31,037 --> 01:17:33,625
The College will not break conclave.

788
01:17:34,862 --> 01:17:36,738
May I suggest...

789
01:17:37,133 --> 01:17:42,151
you direct your energies to helping the Swiss Guard
find this explosive device.

790
01:17:42,656 --> 01:17:43,828
If it exists.

791
01:17:45,508 --> 01:17:47,733
And leave Church leadership...

792
01:17:49,459 --> 01:17:51,282
to its leaders.

793
01:18:03,362 --> 01:18:04,692
Eminence.

794
01:18:07,154 --> 01:18:09,131
There is a growing fear

795
01:18:09,723 --> 01:18:11,980
that without the four Preferiti

796
01:18:11,985 --> 01:18:15,207
it defers much authority for any candidate.

797
01:18:15,208 --> 01:18:16,864
It will not be possible,

798
01:18:17,179 --> 01:18:19,450
- unless...
- Speak plainly.

799
01:18:20,818 --> 01:18:24,449
It is the recommendation of many
that you asked to be removed...

800
01:18:24,455 --> 01:18:26,697
from your post as Great Elector.

801
01:18:27,172 --> 01:18:33,384
Thereby making yourself eligible
to wear the Ring of the Fisherman.

802
01:18:34,692 --> 01:18:37,952
Well, if it is God's will.

803
01:18:45,827 --> 01:18:47,525
May His will be done.

804
01:19:00,822 --> 01:19:03,683
Here! I hear someone.

805
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:06,455
Remove the lid.

806
01:19:09,111 --> 01:19:09,965
Come on. Come on.

807
01:19:14,428 --> 01:19:15,919
Signore, are you okay?

808
01:19:24,423 --> 01:19:26,146
I know he is there.

809
01:19:26,258 --> 01:19:29,201
Madam, it is necessary that you remain quiet.

810
01:19:29,317 --> 01:19:33,691
Don't tell me that I should remain calm.
I want to know what he will do.

811
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:39,389
Commander, here's Ms. Vetra.

812
01:19:40,867 --> 01:19:43,412
Those journals are private property.
I demand that you return them to me.

813
01:19:43,414 --> 01:19:46,551
They're material evidence in a Vatican investigation.

814
01:19:49,452 --> 01:19:50,400
I am an Italian citizen.

815
01:19:50,401 --> 01:19:56,400
- My rights do not end just because I crossed the other side.
- This is not Italy. It's not even Rome. It's the Vatican.

816
01:19:56,519 --> 01:19:58,055
A country with its own laws.

817
01:19:58,059 --> 01:20:01,502
And when those journals passed the border,
they became my property.

818
01:20:01,507 --> 01:20:03,231
I will give them back to you

819
01:20:03,857 --> 01:20:06,688
when I've decided they contain nothing
of value to the investigation.

820
01:20:06,891 --> 01:20:09,027
Do you have something to hide, Commandante Richter?

821
01:20:12,352 --> 01:20:13,890
Do you, Dr. Vetra?

822
01:20:35,516 --> 01:20:37,870
If it were up to me, it wouldn't be this way.

823
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:42,074
It's a sin to kill with pain.

824
01:20:43,324 --> 01:20:45,474
It's a sin to kill without reason, Father.

825
01:20:51,763 --> 01:20:53,125
They made me a sinner.

826
01:21:12,877 --> 01:21:14,549
Saint Theresa on fire.

827
01:21:18,044 --> 01:21:19,225
Professor Langdon?

828
01:21:20,543 --> 01:21:22,695
- What direction is that?
- West, I think.

829
01:21:22,790 --> 01:21:24,705
"Across Rome the mystic elements unfold."

830
01:21:26,848 --> 01:21:31,629
Piazza Barba Rini is here.
Saint Theresa is here.

831
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:34,661
Where is the Santa Maria del Popolo, the first altar of science?

832
01:21:34,769 --> 01:21:36,085
- Santa Maria del Popolo?
- Yes.

833
01:21:38,502 --> 01:21:39,464
Thank you.

834
01:21:40,339 --> 01:21:41,935
St. Peter's is here.

835
01:21:42,601 --> 01:21:44,274
We are here.

836
01:21:46,243 --> 01:21:47,948
A church with water.

837
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,401
Wait. Wait, wait.

838
01:21:51,817 --> 01:21:53,195
Across Rome.

839
01:21:55,559 --> 01:21:57,338
The poem must mean it's literally across Rome.

840
01:21:57,465 --> 01:21:58,414
Professor Langdon.

841
01:21:58,414 --> 01:22:01,177
Commander Richter has ordered me to escort
you to the Vatican immediately.

842
01:22:01,409 --> 01:22:05,969
Piazza Navona. Earth. Air. Fire. Water.

843
01:22:06,603 --> 01:22:08,142
"A-Cross" Rome.

844
01:22:08,695 --> 01:22:10,252
Bernini's Four Rivers.

845
01:22:11,891 --> 01:22:14,841
Professor Langdon, the Vatican insists that
I have to take you back immediately.

846
01:22:15,058 --> 01:22:17,301
The Vatican is about to see its fourth cardinal murdered tonight.

847
01:22:17,505 --> 01:22:18,611
Now, look.

848
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:22,239
You can do as they say and force me back to the Vatican,

849
01:22:22,752 --> 01:22:24,433
where we can all mourn his death together.

850
01:22:24,434 --> 01:22:27,097
Or you can show me how real cops act

851
01:22:27,527 --> 01:22:31,220
and take me to Piazza Navona,
where we still might be able to stop it.

852
01:22:34,336 --> 01:22:36,293
Oh. By all means, let's talk it over.

853
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,225
In fourteen minutes, he's going to be dead.

854
01:22:45,139 --> 01:22:46,578
Okay. This way, Professor.

855
01:22:55,288 --> 01:22:56,525
Yes, Padre?

856
01:22:57,035 --> 01:22:59,718
At 11:15, if the church is still in peril,

857
01:23:01,056 --> 01:23:02,957
give the order to evacuate the cardinals.

858
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:05,791
But with dignity.

859
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:09,407
Let them walk out into St. Peter's Square
with their heads held high.

860
01:23:10,171 --> 01:23:14,544
We don't want the last image of this church to be of
frightened old men sneaking out the back door.

861
01:23:31,204 --> 01:23:32,634
"Where the angels guide thee..."

862
01:23:38,510 --> 01:23:40,852
There it is. There it is.

863
01:23:40,912 --> 01:23:42,880
Professor, I know this fountain.
There is no angel.

864
01:23:43,086 --> 01:23:45,846
The dove. The angel of peace.

865
01:23:45,927 --> 01:23:47,520
And it's looking in what direction?

866
01:23:48,077 --> 01:23:49,519
Uh... east, I think.

867
01:24:00,908 --> 01:24:03,613
Professor, just wait here. Stay put.

868
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:41,339
Good evening. Can you help me?

869
01:24:41,946 --> 01:24:44,166
I need a doctor.

870
01:24:59,756 --> 01:25:01,034
Come here.

871
01:25:04,228 --> 01:25:05,225
Calm down. Don't shoot.

872
01:25:05,726 --> 01:25:06,826
Don't shoot.

873
01:25:42,464 --> 01:25:44,124
Hey!

874
01:25:57,935 --> 01:26:00,584
Help! Somebody help!

875
01:26:37,975 --> 01:26:39,181
Help! Somebody!

876
01:27:50,738 --> 01:27:51,723
Cardinal Baja.

877
01:27:52,721 --> 01:27:53,652
Cardinal Baja.

878
01:27:54,418 --> 01:27:55,444
Si?

879
01:27:55,726 --> 01:27:57,472
Where was he hiding you?

880
01:27:58,170 --> 01:28:00,339
The Church of Illumination.
Where is it?

881
01:28:01,284 --> 01:28:03,742
Castel Sant'Angelo.

882
01:28:05,394 --> 01:28:07,095
Castle of the Angel.

883
01:28:28,543 --> 01:28:30,718
Sir, there's news about Cardinal Baja.

884
01:28:31,955 --> 01:28:35,316
The cardinal told Langdon he was being
held in Castel Sant'Angelo.

885
01:28:35,594 --> 01:28:37,844
If Langdon's right, that's where the bomb is.

886
01:28:38,421 --> 01:28:41,072
- Send everyone we can spare.
- And you?

887
01:28:41,422 --> 01:28:42,476
I'm staying here.

888
01:28:55,847 --> 01:28:57,001
Vittoria.

889
01:28:58,265 --> 01:28:59,890
- You're all right?
- I'm all right, yes. What about you?

890
01:28:59,892 --> 01:29:01,568
I just heard about Olivetti on the radio.

891
01:29:01,569 --> 01:29:02,641
I'm all right. I'm okay.

892
01:29:08,838 --> 01:29:12,077
Robert, we can't trust Richter.
He took Silvano's journals.

893
01:29:12,136 --> 01:29:14,209
There must be something in there he doesn't want us to see.

894
01:29:14,830 --> 01:29:16,348
The head of the Swiss Guard.

895
01:29:18,463 --> 01:29:22,888
From the Castel Sant'Angelo. It's close enough so the wireless
signal from that camera could still reach the Vatican.

896
01:29:24,466 --> 01:29:26,854
The Church of Illumination is somewhere here

897
01:29:27,586 --> 01:29:29,402
and your canister is inside it.

898
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:50,605
Come with me.

899
01:29:54,649 --> 01:29:57,820
For 400 years, the Illuminati met right under the Church's nose.

900
01:29:57,925 --> 01:30:00,981
The Vatican used this as a hideout and
as a prison for their enemies.

901
01:30:01,602 --> 01:30:05,551
If the explosion happens here,
would the blast radius take out the Vatican?

902
01:30:06,223 --> 01:30:08,015
And part of Rome along with it.

903
01:30:26,190 --> 01:30:27,598
They're pointing to it. The angels.

904
01:30:28,178 --> 01:30:29,317
The container must be down there.
Come on!

905
01:31:16,133 --> 01:31:18,435
- Where are they going?
- Back to search the other castle.

906
01:31:18,436 --> 01:31:20,781
No, no. It has to be here!

907
01:31:25,485 --> 01:31:26,985
Robert, it's a dead end.

908
01:31:27,590 --> 01:31:28,622
No, it's not.

909
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:31,146
See if you can find a flashlight.

910
01:31:48,187 --> 01:31:50,142
All of these stones are rectangular granite.

911
01:31:50,724 --> 01:31:52,594
Except right here. What is this?

912
01:31:57,330 --> 01:31:58,462
It's a pentagram.

913
01:31:58,823 --> 01:31:59,860
An eye...

914
01:32:00,611 --> 01:32:01,842
that leads to...

915
01:32:02,146 --> 01:32:03,002
Nowhere.

916
01:32:12,369 --> 01:32:13,369
Robert?

917
01:32:15,506 --> 01:32:18,174
These walls overlap and there's a passageway in here.

918
01:32:18,175 --> 01:32:19,723
Here. Let me have the flashlight.

919
01:32:42,407 --> 01:32:45,249
It's a passageway that leads to the Vatican.

920
01:32:45,550 --> 01:32:47,748
An ancient escape route.

921
01:32:49,731 --> 01:32:51,454
Oh, God.

922
01:32:53,563 --> 01:32:54,451
Here.

923
01:32:57,031 --> 01:32:58,251
Look.

924
01:33:30,151 --> 01:33:31,566
Get on the radio.

925
01:33:31,567 --> 01:33:34,169
Get the word out.
Conclave remains sealed.

926
01:33:34,170 --> 01:33:37,888
- But the Camerlengo gave the order for evacuation at...
- I'm counter-manning it.

927
01:33:43,802 --> 01:33:45,791
This is it. This is their church.

928
01:33:48,318 --> 01:33:50,799
The canister should be lit by artificial light.

929
01:34:13,843 --> 01:34:15,016
It's not here, Robert.

930
01:34:15,066 --> 01:34:17,361
"The shining star at the end of the path."
It has to be.

931
01:34:17,769 --> 01:34:19,520
It's not here.

932
01:34:19,702 --> 01:34:21,857
- What's the poem say?
- Nothing.

933
01:34:21,908 --> 01:34:27,011
Nothing. It's all over. There was just four lines,
each one describing...

934
01:34:35,947 --> 01:34:37,695
There's a fifth brand.

935
01:34:37,745 --> 01:34:39,776
It's not an ambigram.
It's just two crossed keys.

936
01:34:39,977 --> 01:34:42,621
- The symbol for the Vatican.
- No.

937
01:34:43,428 --> 01:34:46,113
No, the papacy.
They intend to kill him.

938
01:34:46,448 --> 01:34:48,000
Before they destroy the Vatican,

939
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:51,504
- they're going to brand and kill the pope himself.
- There is no pope.

940
01:34:51,773 --> 01:34:53,629
"Tempo Sede Vacante."

941
01:34:53,764 --> 01:34:55,865
The Camerlengo.

942
01:34:57,105 --> 01:34:59,764
- We have to warn him.
- Take a step back, please.

943
01:35:01,091 --> 01:35:03,513
Take your cell phone from your pocket.

944
01:35:06,663 --> 01:35:08,404
Throw it in the fire.

945
01:35:18,700 --> 01:35:20,025
Murderer.

946
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:22,584
You know, when they call me,

947
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:24,342
and they all call me,

948
01:35:25,077 --> 01:35:29,940
it is so important to them that I know that
what they ask is the Lord's will.

949
01:35:30,580 --> 01:35:33,020
Or Allah's. Or Yahweh's.

950
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:36,459
And I suppose they're right.

951
01:35:40,303 --> 01:35:44,344
Because if he was not vengeful, I would not exist, now, would I?

952
01:35:44,677 --> 01:35:47,299
I've had several chances to eliminate you tonight.

953
01:35:47,606 --> 01:35:51,111
You're still alive because you have no weapon.
And they didn't ask me to kill you.

954
01:35:51,179 --> 01:35:54,328
But if you pursue me, it is another matter.

955
01:36:01,063 --> 01:36:02,278
Be careful.

956
01:36:02,846 --> 01:36:04,725
These are men of God.

957
01:36:16,887 --> 01:36:18,084
The Camerlengo.

958
01:36:26,706 --> 01:36:28,529
Have you come to make me a martyr?

959
01:36:36,448 --> 01:36:37,462
Here. Here.

960
01:38:01,433 --> 01:38:03,056
- I need to see the Camerlengo.
- He is not available.

961
01:38:03,158 --> 01:38:05,690
- I demand to see the Camerlengo!
- He is not available.

962
01:38:07,377 --> 01:38:08,759
We'll see about that.

963
01:38:17,907 --> 01:38:20,619
Oh. It's a chiusa chiave.
It's a one way portal.

964
01:38:20,959 --> 01:38:22,781
The only entrance is on the other side.

965
01:38:23,034 --> 01:38:25,451
No. Hey! Help!

966
01:38:33,530 --> 01:38:35,929
This is Robert Langdon and Dr. Vetra. Open the door.

967
01:38:49,006 --> 01:38:50,670
The Camerlengo is in danger.

968
01:39:04,058 --> 01:39:06,414
He's the one. He's got a gun.

969
01:39:09,882 --> 01:39:11,804
- Illuminatus!
- You bastard.

970
01:39:11,805 --> 01:39:13,173
Illuminatus!

971
01:39:14,074 --> 01:39:14,906
You bastard!

972
01:39:22,644 --> 01:39:23,709
Padre?

973
01:39:23,684 --> 01:39:27,837
Order the evacuation.
We only have nineteen minutes.

974
01:39:30,978 --> 01:39:32,608
Here. He's...

975
01:39:32,693 --> 01:39:34,994
And get the helicopter for the older cardinals, right?

976
01:39:34,995 --> 01:39:35,695
Yes, sir.

977
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:49,926
Robert?

978
01:39:50,289 --> 01:39:52,848
The brand, the symbol.
Could it have another meaning?

979
01:39:59,184 --> 01:40:02,382
Crossed keys, but those were upside down.

980
01:40:02,417 --> 01:40:03,982
St. Peter.

981
01:40:04,700 --> 01:40:06,671
The first pope...

982
01:40:07,774 --> 01:40:10,643
- was crucified upside down.
- On Vatican Hill.

983
01:40:10,649 --> 01:40:13,512
- A few hundred feet below us.
- Necropolis. City of the dead.

984
01:40:13,514 --> 01:40:16,058
"Upon this rock, I will build my church."

985
01:40:16,059 --> 01:40:18,688
"Or bring it down upon itself."

986
01:40:19,464 --> 01:40:22,682
The bomb. It's in St. Peter's tomb.

987
01:40:36,910 --> 01:40:38,435
The grid is still cycling.

988
01:40:38,436 --> 01:40:40,541
The power to this section must be down.

989
01:41:26,008 --> 01:41:29,012
It must be here. It must be.

990
01:41:39,706 --> 01:41:40,977
Don't touch it.

991
01:41:42,482 --> 01:41:44,032
We have seven minutes.

992
01:41:49,642 --> 01:41:52,139
Robert, hold this.

993
01:42:31,143 --> 01:42:33,093
It's cold down here, isn't it?

994
01:42:33,697 --> 01:42:35,256
What's wrong?

995
01:42:35,143 --> 01:42:37,879
Cold decreases battery life.

996
01:42:39,777 --> 01:42:43,202
- We may have less than five minutes.
- So?

997
01:42:43,300 --> 01:42:46,134
If I pull the power with less than five minutes...

998
01:42:46,139 --> 01:42:49,070
the residual charge won't hold suspension.

999
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:54,019
We should leave it here and get clear if we can.
At least down here the damage...

1000
01:42:54,020 --> 01:42:54,602
No!

1001
01:42:55,565 --> 01:42:57,532
- No. Wait!
- Father!

1002
01:42:59,810 --> 01:43:05,306
We are live here at St. Peter's Square where, despite
a bomb threat, and an orderly evacuation,

1003
01:43:05,307 --> 01:43:07,774
the crowd is actually growing in size.

1004
01:43:07,979 --> 01:43:12,777
As we await an official announcement from the Vatican
spokesman as to the exact nature of the threat

1005
01:43:12,778 --> 01:43:15,944
and whether or not they are treating it as a credible danger...

1006
01:43:24,198 --> 01:43:25,202
This way!

1007
01:43:54,251 --> 01:43:55,383
He's got a bomb with him.

1008
01:43:56,621 --> 01:43:57,682
A bomb?

1009
01:44:02,947 --> 01:44:05,604
Roberto, this is an emergency.
I'll take her up alone.

1010
01:44:10,219 --> 01:44:12,269
He's got clearance.

1011
01:44:36,214 --> 01:44:38,376
Oh, my God.

1012
01:46:34,912 --> 01:46:36,553
Get down!

1013
01:49:21,928 --> 01:49:23,152
Cardinal Strauss?

1014
01:49:23,952 --> 01:49:27,527
It was the Camerlengo.
He has saved us all.

1015
01:49:28,220 --> 01:49:32,048
He has saved the Church and he's still alive.

1016
01:49:32,606 --> 01:49:34,617
Praise God. Praise God.

1017
01:49:39,889 --> 01:49:41,130
He is alive.

1018
01:49:41,442 --> 01:49:44,378
He sacrificed himself for all of us.

1019
01:50:11,566 --> 01:50:14,341
You know the worst thing we thought would happen

1020
01:50:15,517 --> 01:50:18,831
was that our work would fall into the
hands of the energy companies.

1021
01:50:21,573 --> 01:50:23,500
We thought we could change the world.

1022
01:50:24,178 --> 01:50:27,964
- So naive.
- No, not naive.

1023
01:50:29,274 --> 01:50:30,545
Innocent, maybe.

1024
01:50:31,114 --> 01:50:33,452
But it's not a crime.

1025
01:50:34,702 --> 01:50:36,090
I'm not so sure.

1026
01:50:38,348 --> 01:50:40,006
Go back to work.

1027
01:50:41,501 --> 01:50:43,185
Change the world.

1028
01:51:02,479 --> 01:51:08,382
A gift, uh, you understand?
Let's say for Catholics everywhere.

1029
01:51:08,383 --> 01:51:11,255
The Carmelengo's age shouldn't influence the decision.

1030
01:51:11,434 --> 01:51:17,350
Signori, you are no doubt aware that by Holy Law
the man is inelligible for election to the papacy.

1031
01:51:17,340 --> 01:51:19,327
He's not a cardinal.
He's a priest.

1032
01:51:19,328 --> 01:51:20,597
He's of insufficient age.

1033
01:51:20,807 --> 01:51:23,678
Or maybe there's a way we could consider the possibility.

1034
01:51:24,171 --> 01:51:28,888
I am sorry. The protocols of conclave
are not subject to modification.

1035
01:51:29,008 --> 01:51:30,826
I will not call a ballot on this matter.

1036
01:51:31,032 --> 01:51:33,608
But, signore, you would not hold a ballot.

1037
01:51:33,811 --> 01:51:37,184
Surely, you remember?
You gave up your post as Great Elector.

1038
01:51:38,030 --> 01:51:40,064
They are singing at St. Peter's Square.

1039
01:51:40,152 --> 01:51:42,888
Now, what happened here tonight transcends our laws.

1040
01:51:43,008 --> 01:51:48,888
Has it? Is it God's will that we give ourselves over to frenzy?
Discard the rules of the Church?

1041
01:51:48,890 --> 01:51:52,019
Perhaps we need not discard them.

1042
01:51:52,345 --> 01:51:57,747
Signori, I am thinking now of Romano
Pontifici Eligendo numero 60...

1043
01:51:57,887 --> 01:52:01,081
- Acclamation by Adoration.
- Exactly, signore. Exactly. Yes.

1044
01:52:01,150 --> 01:52:04,144
If the Holy Spirit speaks through us,

1045
01:52:04,269 --> 01:52:09,072
- and we call a man's name out loud...
- That is election by adoration.

1046
01:52:09,073 --> 01:52:11,175
- Yes.
- He's God's choice.

1047
01:52:11,176 --> 01:52:16,840
Yes. And the candidate need only be an
ordained member of the clergy,

1048
01:52:16,841 --> 01:52:21,666
present in the Sistine Chapel at the moment of his election.

1049
01:52:53,253 --> 01:52:55,375
- Signor Camerlengo?
- Yes?

1050
01:52:55,776 --> 01:52:58,857
The cardinals ask you to join them
in conclave as soon as possible.

1051
01:52:59,965 --> 01:53:02,534
- Me?
- Yes, Padre.

1052
01:53:25,125 --> 01:53:25,947
What are you doing?

1053
01:53:26,397 --> 01:53:28,842
Silvano's journals. I want them back.

1054
01:53:52,772 --> 01:53:54,045
Richter said...

1055
01:53:55,866 --> 01:53:59,790
His Holiness suffered from seizures and steps were taken...

1056
01:54:01,121 --> 01:54:02,319
for safety.

1057
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,269
He made sure he was watched, he said.

1058
01:54:11,352 --> 01:54:13,895
What if he were trying to give me this key?

1059
01:54:15,559 --> 01:54:17,026
That's the Papal office.

1060
01:54:17,960 --> 01:54:22,432
If the Pope was worried about seizures, he must've had
Richter install cameras without telling anyone.

1061
01:54:22,721 --> 01:54:25,423
To keep an eye on him for his safety.

1062
01:54:27,186 --> 01:54:28,861
Maybe it records.

1063
01:54:39,427 --> 01:54:43,572
<i>- I read the journals, Patrick.
- The scientist kept journals. So?</i>

1064
01:54:44,173 --> 01:54:46,939
<i>- You figure prominently in them.
- Really?</i>

1065
01:54:47,460 --> 01:54:51,741
<i>The Devoli wasn't just a physicist.
He was also a Catholic priest.</i>

1066
01:54:52,239 --> 01:54:58,400
As such, he was deeply conflicted about the implications
of his work and in need of spiritual guidance.

1067
01:54:59,034 --> 01:55:00,198
Like Galileo.

1068
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:04,711
About a month ago, he requested an audience with the Pope.

1069
01:55:04,713 --> 01:55:06,113
But you know that,

1070
01:55:06,705 --> 01:55:09,586
cause you granted the audience and
you were also present during it.

1071
01:55:09,688 --> 01:55:12,866
The 'God Particle'. To actually claim an act of creation.

1072
01:55:12,867 --> 01:55:17,154
- The blasphemy. The arrogance.
- The Holy Father didn't see it like that.

1073
01:55:17,459 --> 01:55:19,359
He urged him to go public.

1074
01:55:19,564 --> 01:55:25,475
His Holiness thought that the discovery could actually
scientifically prove the existence of a divine power.

1075
01:55:25,611 --> 01:55:28,614
And begin to bridge the gap between science and religion.

1076
01:55:28,718 --> 01:55:31,120
His work was not religious.
It was sacrilegious.

1077
01:55:31,122 --> 01:55:32,034
But you...

1078
01:55:32,724 --> 01:55:36,664
You saw the pope's position as a softening of church law.

1079
01:55:36,669 --> 01:55:40,484
As an old man's weakness. Your father's weakness.

1080
01:55:40,819 --> 01:55:44,420
- You murdered the Vicar of Christ.
- He raised me to protect this Church,

1081
01:55:44,458 --> 01:55:45,923
even from within.

1082
01:55:47,600 --> 01:55:52,250
Then you conjured up an old enemy from the past.
The Illuminati.

1083
01:55:52,485 --> 01:55:57,550
You found the ancient brands in the papal vaults
and put them to use to spread fear!

1084
01:55:57,550 --> 01:55:59,792
The Cardinals are men of belief.

1085
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:03,715
Right now, their belief in evil is uniting them.

1086
01:56:03,716 --> 01:56:06,815
The entire Catholic world will be united by this attack.

1087
01:56:06,820 --> 01:56:08,402
There is no attack.

1088
01:56:09,690 --> 01:56:14,443
You're trying to convince the Cardinals they're in a war,
so they will choose a warrior to lead them.

1089
01:56:14,442 --> 01:56:15,776
We are at war.

1090
01:56:15,878 --> 01:56:17,915
We're weak when we should be strong.

1091
01:56:17,919 --> 01:56:21,614
If science is allowed to claim the power of creation,

1092
01:56:21,828 --> 01:56:23,586
what is left for God?

1093
01:56:23,821 --> 01:56:25,545
It didn't work, Patrick.

1094
01:56:26,533 --> 01:56:29,219
- It isn't finished.
- Oh yes, it's finished.

1095
01:56:31,191 --> 01:56:32,882
It's finished.

1096
01:56:33,740 --> 01:56:36,845
I've shown the journals to Father Simeon.

1097
01:56:36,851 --> 01:56:38,931
The moment the doors to the Conclave open,

1098
01:56:38,937 --> 01:56:41,092
he will tell the Cardinals what you've done.

1099
01:56:42,181 --> 01:56:44,391
I was planning on doing this alone.

1100
01:56:47,466 --> 01:56:48,850
Put it down.

1101
01:56:51,565 --> 01:56:53,892
But, perhaps, it's better that you're here.

1102
01:56:53,939 --> 01:56:55,320
Put it down.

1103
01:56:57,219 --> 01:56:58,956
Put it away.

1104
01:57:09,424 --> 01:57:13,620
Help. He's the one.
He's got a gun.

1105
01:57:17,264 --> 01:57:19,396
- Illuminatus!
- You bastard.

1106
01:57:19,553 --> 01:57:20,415
Illuminatus!

1107
01:57:20,416 --> 01:57:21,967
You bastard!

1108
01:57:25,946 --> 01:57:27,153
Padre.

1109
01:57:36,755 --> 01:57:40,223
<i>And get the helicopter for the older cardinals, right?</i>

1110
01:58:29,171 --> 01:58:32,214
I've been summoned by the College of Cardinals.

1111
01:59:42,037 --> 01:59:43,556
Gently.

1112
01:59:43,564 --> 01:59:45,238
But within our walls.

1113
01:59:56,960 --> 01:59:59,823
He's on your side.

1114
02:00:45,853 --> 02:00:50,061
Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.

1115
02:01:37,960 --> 02:01:42,368
Church sources now confirm that Carmelengo,
Father Patrick McKenna,

1116
02:01:42,369 --> 02:01:48,112
has died of internal injuries sustained in his heroic fall...

1117
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:54,000
The Catholic church thanks Camerlengo for his selfless act
and demands his immediate canonization.

1118
02:01:54,340 --> 02:01:59,400
The Vatican has also confirmed the deaths of three Cardinals
and the fire in the Santa Maria della Vittoria.

1119
02:01:59,446 --> 02:02:03,821
As we await the appearance of the new
Holy Father Cardinal Baggia of Italy,

1120
02:02:03,822 --> 02:02:09,665
one of the four original Preferiti, who, despite terrorist
attempts at disruption seems to have been selected

1121
02:02:09,666 --> 02:02:13,822
in one of the swiftest and smoothest conclaves
in modern church history.

1122
02:02:20,516 --> 02:02:22,669
Professor Langdon? Please.

1123
02:02:39,010 --> 02:02:41,859
A token of thanks from His Holiness

1124
02:02:42,361 --> 02:02:44,799
and from his new Camerlengo.

1125
02:02:46,573 --> 02:02:48,828
We are grateful you saved his life.

1126
02:02:49,455 --> 02:02:54,870
And it's our understanding that you require this text
to complete your scholary work.

1127
02:02:56,603 --> 02:02:59,798
We ask only that in your last grand testament

1128
02:03:00,067 --> 02:03:03,861
you ensure it finds its way home.

1129
02:03:06,674 --> 02:03:07,623
Of course.

1130
02:03:08,141 --> 02:03:09,811
And when you write of us,

1131
02:03:10,534 --> 02:03:12,583
and you will write of us,

1132
02:03:13,032 --> 02:03:14,776
may I ask one thing?

1133
02:03:15,473 --> 02:03:16,996
Do so gently.

1134
02:03:19,348 --> 02:03:20,485
I'll try.

1135
02:03:21,081 --> 02:03:22,485
Religion is flawed,

1136
02:03:23,458 --> 02:03:26,063
but only because man is flawed.

1137
02:03:26,064 --> 02:03:28,681
All men, including this one.

1138
02:03:43,525 --> 02:03:45,177
He chose the name Luke.

1139
02:03:48,087 --> 02:03:50,862
There's been many Marks and Johns.

1140
02:03:52,367 --> 02:03:53,843
Never a Luke.

1141
02:03:54,608 --> 02:03:56,337
It said he was a doctor.

1142
02:03:57,081 --> 02:04:00,301
It's quite a message.
Science and faith, all in one.

1143
02:04:01,106 --> 02:04:03,273
The world is in need of both.

1144
02:04:05,283 --> 02:04:07,126
You'll counsel him wisely.

1145
02:04:07,981 --> 02:04:10,774
I'm an old man.
I'll counsel him briefly.

1146
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:18,466
Mr. Langdon.

1147
02:04:23,489 --> 02:04:28,210
Thanks be to God for sending someone to protect this church.

1148
02:04:32,241 --> 02:04:34,883
I don't believe He sent me, Father.

1149
02:04:35,084 --> 02:04:36,704
Oh, my son.

1150
02:04:37,266 --> 02:04:39,485
Of course He did.
