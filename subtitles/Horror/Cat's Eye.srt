One more minute to
Cat's Eye's Forewarning Time!

24
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,100
Listen good! We are setting up a security system which can address all situations.

25
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,650
Don't let your guard down!

26
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,980
The Cat'll show up without fail.

27

What?!

28
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,260
Section chief!

29
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,860
What has brought you here?

30
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,610
Chief, you are supposed to be at the station.

31
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:50,670
Chief!

32
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,950

Utsumi!

34
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,590
I don't think I can put you in charge.

35
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,590
I'll take over the investigation
from now on.

36
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,530
Leave everything to me.

37
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,050
I'll arrest Cat's Eye without fail.

38
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:00,870
Don't worry!

39
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,850
Please go back to the station, will you?

40
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,540
You've let Cat's Eye go 5 times already.

41
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,930
Until Cat's Eye's forewarning time is over,

42
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,990
I'll guard this painting by myself.

43
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,660
Get out of my way, Utsumi!

44
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:11,890
Chief!

45
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,240
Don't panic!

46
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,690
Use Emergency Lights!

47
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:22,450

49
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,540

Everyone! Follow me!

51

Go quickly!

54
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,400
Yes!!

55
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,010
I can't believe they fell for this trick.

56
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,840
A well planned trick is always
simple but bold and effective.

57
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,930
This is our father's 6th painting.

58
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:22,530
Yes.

59
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,410
What's up?!

60
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,900
Did you find Cat's Eye?

61
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,280
Chief Inspector Shibata...

62
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,160
What are you planning
to do with the painting?

63
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,700
This?

64
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,830
That's a clever disguise.

65
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,930
Wait a moment!

66
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,930
But, it doesn't fool me!

67
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,020
What the hell are you doing! Utsumi!!

68
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,810
Cut it out!

69
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,500
What's that girly yelp!

70
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,430
I can tell by your eyes. Your eyes!

71
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,280
You can't play games with me.

72
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,080
Reveal yourself, Cat's Eye!

73
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,900
Hey!

74
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,900
I won't let you get away!

75
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,120
Wait!

76
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,590
The Cat's Net!

77
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,890
Surround the area!

78
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,220
Wait!

79
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:33,800
Wait!

80
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,920
They vanished!

81
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,840
Don't let the cats
escape from the building!

82
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,200
Yes, Sir!

83
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,210
They're up there!

84
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,440
Get them!

85
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,410
Go!

86
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,530
Go to the 3rd Floor!

87
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,260
Ow..ouch...

88
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,900

145
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,880
How can you even call yourself a cop?

I swear I'll catch him next time.

164
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,610
Cat's Eye...How cool can you get?!

165
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,980
Right, Toshio-san?

166
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:42,880
Schoolgirls' New Hero!!
Big Scoop Illustration Cat's Eye!
Wow! Cool!!

167
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,730
Schoolgirls' New Hero?

168
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:42,780
What are they thinking?!

169
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,950
They're just thieves!!

170
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,240
What are they thinking?

171
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,110
What a world we live in...

172
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:51,270
What are you mumbling about?

173
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,140
Here.

174
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,920
Your usual.

175
00:14:59,130 --> 00:14:59,970
What?

176
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,160
What is it?

177
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,840
That face, Toshio…

178
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,640
You were chewed out
by the Chief again.

179
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,780
Noisy, nosy.

180
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,900
Annoying.

181
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,490
Why don't you quit the force?

182
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,670
Being a cop doesn't fit
your image, Toshio.

183
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,230
Hey, that's my decision to make.

184
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,300
Stop shooting your mouth off.

185
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,820
Ouch!

186
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,050
You...

187
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:30,780
I'm just worried just because
you are a classmate of mine.

188
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,540
You're such a jerk, Toshio!

189
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,220
Hmph!

190
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,720
Don't Hmph me!

191
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,720
Don't make me arrest you!

192
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,060
They must be pretty intimate, as they
fight all the time. Right, Rui-neesan.

193
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,150
Yes.

194
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,770
They've been like that
since high school.

195
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,770
I want a boyfriend
with whom I can fight

196
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:50,340
just so that making-up
becomes memorable.

197
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,630
Ai, you'll be late for school.

198
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,000
Yeah, you're right!

199
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:01,060
Toshio-san?

200
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:01,390
eh?

201
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,020
Do you wanna
go on a date with me?

202
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,620
Eh?

203
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,760
Ai!!

204
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:06,910
See Ya!!

205
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,220
Take care!

206
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,790
Toshio-san!

207
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,370
eh?

208
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,690
Hitomi's upset...

209
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:19,180
'Cause you haven't
asked her out lately.

210
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:19,860
You think so?

211
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,530
Of course!

212
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:23,760
On your next day off,

213
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,520
Will you take Hitomi out?

214
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,650
Pretty please!

215
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,380
I see...

216
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,120
Here you are.

217
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,130
Thank you.

218
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,760
What a reflex!

219
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,200
Just like a clasp-knife
reflex in the cat.

220
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,550
It doesn't feel right...

221
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,940
This is not America...

222
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:27,480
Japanese cops don't need guns!

223
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,690
You're right!

224
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:35,060
A ball is better for catching cats.

225
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,470
You're a detective Utsumi. Right?

226
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,500
And you are?

227
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,830
I belong to the INTERPOL Division
at Tokyo Metropolitan Police.

228
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,980
My name is Asatani Mitsuko.

229
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,860
What does INTERPOL want from me?

230
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:10,310
Would you like to know
who Cat's Eye really is?

231
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,820
The identity of Cat's Eye?

232
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,120
Sure, tell me.

233
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,920
Will you help me?

234
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,910
I knew there was a catch.

235
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,180
So, what do you want from me?

236
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:26,150
Until I'm done with my investigation,

237
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,220
I want you to stop yours.

238
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,100
What are you talking about?

239
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,730
That's impossible.

240
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:34,450
I must be the one to catch Cat's Eye.

241
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:37,800
We need Cat's Eye
to arrest the Ko-Ryu-Dan.

242
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,760
Ko-Ryu-Dan?

243
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,860
It's an international Crime Syndicate.

244
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,940
They're after Cat's Eye.

245
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,180
I won't let people like them interfere.

246
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,160
If Cat's Eye is around,

247
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,140
Ko-Ryu-Dan will definitely show up.

248
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,880
I see.

249
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:02,640
Using the Cat to lure out the Dragons...

250
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,580
I'll catch the Dragons.

251
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,820
You arrest the Cat.

252
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,690
I got it.

253
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,860
This conversation never happened.

254
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,870
Don't you want to know
who Cat's Eye really is?

255
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,170
I'll find my own answers.

256
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,190
You should do the same.

257
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,250
I hate curve balls.

258
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:48,890
Welcome, Welcome!

259
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,100
What do you want?

260
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,570
I've brought
the Emperor with me.

261
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,820
Out of my way!

262
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,000
I can't let anyone in!

263
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,660
What? I'm the boss here!

264
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,540
I must speak to the Emperor.
Get out of my way!

265
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:32,980
Out of my way!

266
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,760
Miss Wong's orders are absolute!

267
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,350
MY orders are absolute!

268
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,060
Out of my way!

269
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:13,910
You dare disobey me, Yan?

270
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:23,730
Miss Wong, you've risen high in rank.

271
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:27,400
But, you are still
under my orders here!

272
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:41,870
The Emperor made me
the new boss here.

273
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,030
Bitch! I'll kill you!

274
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,350
How scary...

275
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,350
I'm really scared...

276
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,760
You think you can kill me?

277
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,620
Black Flag!

278
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,940
Kill them all!

279
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,310
It's perfect.

280
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:35,240
Strange...

281
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,220
Watch out!

282
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,670
Thank you.

283
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,290
Who are you?

284
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,410
I'm an exchange student.

285
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:06,040
My name is Lee.

286
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,750
A date out of the blue…

287
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,750
Rui-neesan said something
to you, didn't she?

288
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,990
She didn't say anything at all...

289
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,500
Where are we going, anyway?

290
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,290
Don't worry about it.

291
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,980
Just be quiet and tag along.

292
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:29,010
Do I have a choice?

293
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:30,310
I'm speeding up.

294
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,920
Hang on.

295
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,580
Hey, Lee-kun!

296
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,580
How come you came to Japan?

297
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:55,350
My father was in Japan before.

298
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:58,120
Oh, I see.

299
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,910
But, I know very little about Japan.

300
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,140
Now that you are in Japan,

301
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,140
Instead of hanging out
at college all the time,

302
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,990
You should go out more.

303
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:13,650
But, my Japanese is terrible...

304
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:18,200
Okay then, I'll show you around!

305
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,290
Will you really?

306
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:24,900
We used to come here
a lot in high school.

307
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,400
Toshio!

308
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,800
Why did you become a cop?

309
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,560
Eh?

310
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,550
You said you were going
to be a baseball player.

311
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,840
So you don't like cops?

312
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,410
I hate them!

313
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:45,060
Well, then...

314
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,400
If I quit the force,

315
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,950
Will you marry me?

316
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,010
What is this?

317
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,700
Just open it.

318
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:07,650
Hold on to it for me.

319
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,520
Toshio...

320
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:10,670
I've already decided.

321
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,990
After I arrest Cat's Eye…

322
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:16,130
I'll quit the force.

323
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:26,560
What does your father do, Lee-kun?

324
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:30,720
My father used to paint.

325
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,660
Your father is an artist, too?

326
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,370
Mine is, too!

327
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,270
Really?!

328
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,140
Yeah.

329
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,690
But, he's not around anymore.

330
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:42,370
How come?

331
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:45,500
When I was a baby,

332
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,370
He disappeared.

333
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:49,390
Did he die?

334
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:49,930
Nope.

335
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,050
I'm sure my father is still alive.

336
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:57,050
That's what I believe.

337
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:11,670
What's wrong, Lee-kun?

338
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,210
I was praying to God.

339
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,860
What for?

340
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,950
Someday…Ai-san

341
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:23,540
...can meet your father.

342
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,980
Can I?

343
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,860
No problem.

344
00:29:30,860 --> 00:02:57,390
My God will let you meet your father.

345
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,800
Sorry I'm late.

346
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:07,070
This is Umehara's Collection Room.

347
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,800
This entire room is one big safe.

348
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,540
Father's self-portrait is in there?

349
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,990
Yes.

350
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,670
Ai...

351
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:18,940
You can crack the security
lock of this safe. Right!

352
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,040
Sure thing.

353
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,930
There's no safe I can't crack.

354
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:28,980
Hitomi, you ask Toshio-san about the security matters.

355
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:33,900
What's wrong, Hitomi?

356
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,200
Toshio proposed to me.

357
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,780
What an uncool ring!

358
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,990
So, Hitomi-neesan, are you
gonna accept his proposal?

359
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:52,540
And your husband-to-be is...

360
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,590
It's okay.

361
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,900
This "Uncoolness" is Toshio to me.

362
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,320
3 more paintings to go.

363
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,260
Then we'll have all of father's paintings back.

364
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:30,990
Hitomi...

365
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:35,060
Until then,Toshio-san is...

366
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,920
Cat's Eye's foe.

367
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,060
I know all about it, Rui-neesan.

368
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:57,290
A thief marrying a cop…

369
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:58,900
It isn't possible...

370
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,980
My Emperor...

371
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,120
Black Flag

372
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,400
Go and kill Cat's Eye!

373
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:47,730
Tonight At Midnight
We claim of ownership of the
7th Kuroda Collection!!

374
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:49,090
Mihara-san,

375
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,370
You're interfering with this operation.

376
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:53,390
I'll protect the painting.

377
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:55,670
Can't you just go over there
where it's much safer?

378
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,470
No way!!

379
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,630
This painting has 100,000,000 yen
price tag on it.

380
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,200
Until midnight comes and goes,

381
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,200
I'll just hold on to it.

382
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:08,240
Besides, this is the safest
room in the house.

383
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,480
This whole room is one big safe.

384
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,000
Like I said, Cat's Eye can
easily open this safe.

385
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,840
Why are you so stubborn?

386
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,590
Shut up!

387
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:19,560
Your job is to catch the cat burglar before it gets here!

388
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,630
Anyhow, I'm staying right here!!

389
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,540
Now leave!

390
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,570
Be careful!

391
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:25,990
Leave! Just leave!

392
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,980
Umehara-san! Watch it!

393
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:33,660
Dammit!
You Octopus head!!

394
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,950
The police is not your
private guards!

395
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,750
Who's there?!

396
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,910
Is it already midnight?

397
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,230
Time is running too fast?

398
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,100
Detective Utsumi!

399
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:15,920
What?!

400
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,840
It's Cat's Eye!

401
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,500
Huh?

402
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,180
Wait!

403
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,650
Don't leave your posts.

404
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:29,250
Yes, Sir!

405
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,030
Damn you!

406
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:57,690
Goddamn it!

407
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:21,520
It's a trap.

408
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,480
Ai. We cancel the plan.

409
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,550
What about our father's
Self-portrait painting?

410
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,970
If we took the painting,

411
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:29,850
We would be blamed
for Umehara's death.

412
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,850
We must go back, Ai.

413
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,240
Ai...

414
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,030
Give it up!

415
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,120
No, I can't.

416
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,350
It's our Father's Self-Portrait!

417
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:41,710
Ai!

418
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,610
Father...

419
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,890
Ai! Run!

420
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:25,060
Run, Cat's Eye!

421
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:27,460
We'll meet later!

422
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:49,440
Who was that?

423
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,440
It wasn't the Cat.

424
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,410
Ko-Ryu-Dan's assassin...

425
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:54,970
Black Flag

426
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,950
Show me your hands!

427
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,250
Why didn't you kill them?

428
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:10,800
I can't kill that girl.

429
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,370
You can't obey my order?!

430
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:16,850
You bastard child!

431
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,430
Black Flag...

432
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,930
My son...

433
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:06,340
Please understand...

434
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,920
This is all for you.

435
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,840
If you kill Cat's Eye

436
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,280
and the Emperor...

437
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:29,910
...you'll be the only

438
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:31,750
remaining blood relative
to the Emperor.

439
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:45,010
Which means...

440
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:48,210
You'll be the new Emperor.

441
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:54,930
Mother, you're the one who
wants to become the Emperor.

442
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:04,890
I don't wish to be the Emperor!

443
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:27,390
I'll kill Cat's Eye myself.

444
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:30,890
And then....

445
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,480
I'll make you the Emperor!

446
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:45,480
Death Threat by Cat's Eye?!
Umehara-san, Yokohama was murdered at Midnight on June 05...

447
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,430
As such,

448
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,750
Cat's Eye investigation has now been assigned

449
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,800
to the 1st section from the 3rd section.

450
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,620
But Chief!

451
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:50,290
The Cat's didn't do this murder.

452
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:52,950
Because I saw the killer myself.

453
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:53,820
Utsumi!

454
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:54,690
Yes?

455
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:56,190
Don't stick your nose

456
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:57,690
in other section's business.

457
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,460
Apart from that,

458
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:03,590
What are you going to do about this?

459
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:06,010
I can't quit now like this.

460
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:07,480
Give it back.

461
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:13,800
I'm Asatani Mitsuko from INTERPOL

462
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,880
So you know who we are...

463
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,240
Yes.

464
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,040
You are the daughters of Kuroda Ryutaro

465
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,550
who was kidnapped 20 years ago.

466
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:28,110
Why did you help us?

467
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:30,830
Cat's Eye is stealing Kuroda Collections...

468
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:33,880
To find out whereabouts of your father.

469
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,600
Father's paintings were stolen…

470
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,590
and our mother was killed.

471
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:42,420
I am after Ko-Ryu-Dan.

472
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,780
Ko-Ryu-Dan?

473
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:45,560
A Chinese Secret Crime Syndicate

474
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,540
lead by the Ryu family.

475
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:52,160
Ko-Ryu-Dan is trying to
rebuild its Fallen Empire.

476
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,160
Ko-Ryu-Dan kidnapped our father.

477
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,030
Is that it?

478
00:45:57,990 --> 00:45:59,780
Painter Kuroda is in Yokohama.

479
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:00,820
What?!

480
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:01,900
Father?!

481
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,480
Father is alive?

482
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,000
There is a man forced
to paint the portrait

483
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,600
of the Emperor in Yokohama.

484
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,580
That man!

485
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:11,160
It has to be Father!

486
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,990
We have to rescue him, Neesan.

487
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:15,510
What are you gonna do?

488
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:17,850
Ko-Ryu-Dan is brutal.

489
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:21,060
Just like yesterday's assassin.

490
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:24,000
Even with a cat's claws…

491
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,800
We can slash up a dragon's eye.

492
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:23,920
Hey, you two, let's go
find Father right now!

493
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,920
Ko-Ryu-Dan is powerful.

494
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,990
To fight, we need a solid plan first.

495
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:34,200
I agree with Rui-neesan.

496
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,470
Since we were attacked
by their assassin,

497
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:40,900
They must be watching
our movements.

498
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:44,540
We must study how they move.

499
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:46,540
I can't wait!

500
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:48,570
If they're after us,

501
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:50,370
then let's take the fight to them!

502
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:51,560
It's too dangerous.

503
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,470
Anyway, we should…

504
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:55,470
No! I'll go alone if I have to.

505
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:56,240
Ai!

506
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,060
Ai!!

507
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:08,490
Ai!
Ai!!

508
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:10,780
Rui-neesan!

509
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:12,610
Before Ko-Ryu-Dan attacks Ai,

510
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:14,970
We must do something fast.

511
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:16,110
Ai's in danger.

512
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:18,780
I'll find their information immediately.

513
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:21,240
Hitomi, You find a way to get in the place.

514
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:25,960
When Father was kidnapped,

515
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,960
I was just a year old.

516
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,640
That's why I don't remember his face.

517
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,800
I want to see my father's face, too.

518
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:49,060
Cat's Eye…

519
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:53,870
I'll lure you

520
00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:54,870
into my trap…

521
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:07,870
and kill you one by one.

522
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:20,650
Father...

523
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:28,000
Lee-kun...

524
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:33,050
This man...

525
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:34,900
This is Ai-san's father?

526
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,200
Yeah.

527
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,200
I know

528
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,630
this man.

529
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:41,660
What?

530
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:43,180
Come with me, Ai-san.

531
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:52,160
You wait here.

532
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,310
Sure.

533
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:41,930
Please calm your anger.

534
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:45,290
We will deliver the Eye of the Dragon

535
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:47,100
without fail.

536
00:50:55,630 --> 00:51:01,630
Ai
(0 year old)

537
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:14,990
Father?

538
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,120
Father!

539
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:29,800
Father!

540
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:45,360
Ai?

541
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,420
Father!

542
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,650
Father...

543
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:05,880
Father!!

544
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:23,560
Are you looking for
someone, young girl?

545
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:44,560
You're so cute.

546
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:52,670
I'll treat you well...

547
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:56,350
...like this rose.

548
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:28,110
How did it go, Rui-neesan?

549
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:29,210
In the corner of Chinatown

550
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:31,370
There is a small a rundown store.

551
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:33,440
That's Ko-Ryu-Dan's Exchange Front.

552
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,800
I got it.

553
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:41,710
Hitomi…

554
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:47,480
About our father...

555
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:50,440
There is a secret I've kept a long time.

556
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:54,120
Our father's secret?

557
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:57,880
I understand.

558
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,090
Let's go.

559
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:11,540
Father!

560
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:12,840
Stop!

561
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:19,070
You agreed not to kill my daughter.

562
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,150
Mother!

563
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:04,000
Mother!!

564
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,970
Rui...

565
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:07,970
Without fail...

566
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:13,310
You must not look for your father.

567
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:17,610
Your father...

568
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:20,050
Your father does not exist any more...

569
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:26,010
We must not look for our father.

570
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:40,410
I am Mrs. Gardener.

571
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:42,800
I have an appointment with Miss Wong.

572
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:05,960
Mrs. Gardener

573
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,770
Where's the stuff

574
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:09,500
you want to show me?

575
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:34,860
So, Mrs. Gardener…

576
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:37,580
Tell me the details

577
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:40,680
about the Kuroda's Collection.

578
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,950
It was stolen from our home.

579
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:56,380
I want to see my father now!

580
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:01,010
Bring him!

581
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:12,460
Mr. Kuroda,

582
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:15,370
Could you possibly show
us your face, please?

583
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:58,290
Good girl…

584
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:01,330
Let me see…

585
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:04,440
Which cat...

586
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:08,030
is hiding here?

587
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:18,140
Ai!

588
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:19,680
Run!

589
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:04,900
Father?

590
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:12,730
It is you, Father, right?

591
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:13,730
I'm Hitomi!

592
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:15,160
I've come to rescue you!

593
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,690
Together,

594
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:27,150
Let's get the hell out of here!

595
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:28,490
I...

596
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:32,950
I won't run away.

597
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:36,710
What are you talking about, Father?

598
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:43,100
If I escape,

599
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:46,500
You will all be killed.

600
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:02,610
You must escape alone.

601
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:04,870
Father!

602
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:09,930
Father...

603
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:16,330
Father!

604
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:34,640
Father!!

605
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:53,790
Miss Wong, what kind of face

606
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:56,240
would you like today?

607
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:04,570
Make me look like a cat.

608
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:08,540
Ai!

609
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:13,110
Rui-neesan,
we must rescue Hitomi-neesan.

610
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:38,750
Father was in there!

611
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:40,300
I saw him with my own eyes!

612
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:43,860
Hitomi, you saw him, too?

613
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:44,540
Yes.

614
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:49,500
Father is trapped.

615
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,270
Let's go and rescue him again!

616
01:02:52,270 --> 01:02:55,920
This time we need a new
plan that will definitely work.

617
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:58,670
Ai...

618
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:16,840
What's this?

619
01:03:19,210 --> 01:03:20,220
I have no idea.

620
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:39,020
Hello, Cat's Eye...

621
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:41,840
If you really want your Daddy back,

622
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:46,010
Listen carefully.

623
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:48,040
I'm willing to trade him

624
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,040
for the Eye of the Dragon

625
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:54,450
in the King Foundation.

626
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:56,450
Your deadline

627
01:03:56,450 --> 01:04:00,890
is twelve
midnight, tomorrow.

628
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:04,860
So, better hurry.

629
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:17,790
The King Foundation.

630
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:19,540
Supposedly,

631
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:22,340
It's a foundation owned
by Arabic smuggler

632
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:26,420
All guards are real Army soldiers.

633
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:28,790
Breaking in there
is near impossible.

634
01:04:28,790 --> 01:04:30,750
There's no time argue.

635
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:33,410
Father's life is in danger!

636
01:04:33,410 --> 01:04:35,240
I agree with Ai!

637
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:39,620
This is a trap that's
set up for us.

638
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:40,900
I don't care
if it's a trap or not!

639
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:46,340
I disagree.

640
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:47,820
Rui-neesan...

641
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:49,820
Don't you want to save Father?

642
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:52,790
Rui-neesan, we have to give it a try.

643
01:04:52,790 --> 01:04:55,990
We can't save him unless
all three of us go!

644
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:07,100
Father...

645
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:08,930
I'll rescue you no matter what.

646
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:29,060
I won't forgive him.

647
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:55,300
My Emperor!

648
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:58,770
Miss Wong will bring the
Eye of the Dragon shortly.

649
01:06:22,370 --> 01:06:24,270
Miss Wong is disguising herself

650
01:06:24,270 --> 01:06:26,420
as you, Cat's Eye.

651
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:37,010
Ai and Rui-neesan are in danger.

652
01:06:37,010 --> 01:06:38,310
I have a plan.

653
01:06:39,970 --> 01:06:40,680
A plan?

654
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:44,900
Will you partner up with me?

655
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:05,410
No one has come out alive

656
01:07:05,410 --> 01:07:12,280
after breaking into
the King Foundation.

657
01:07:17,310 --> 01:07:21,560
Cat's Eye will be dead.

658
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:26,530
And the Eye of the Dragon will be mine.

659
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,630
If I can get the Eye of the Dragon,

660
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:34,470
and kill the Emperor...

661
01:07:34,470 --> 01:07:41,310
Black Flag will become
the new Emperor.

662
01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:51,310
The Kings Foundation

663
01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:09,500
Japanese Police Officer?

664
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:12,500
What is it that you want?

665
01:08:13,470 --> 01:08:15,160
Tonight, Cat's Eye
will break into this place.

666
01:08:16,410 --> 01:08:20,190
Cat's Eye always leaves a notice first.

667
01:08:20,190 --> 01:08:22,640
We haven't heard from them, Sir.

668
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,640
No mistakes in my investigation.

669
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,670
Let me secure this area.

670
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:29,120
The defense of this foundation has

671
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:31,730
nothing to do with the Japanese Police.

672
01:08:31,730 --> 01:08:35,510
Please leave quietly.

673
01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:36,750
That has nothing to do with me.

674
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,750
Don't come back again!

675
01:09:03,950 --> 01:09:05,740
Dammit!

676
01:09:05,740 --> 01:09:06,970
I won't give up!

677
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,830
Rat-kun, I'm counting on you.

678
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:45,800
Thanks for the directions, Rat-kun.

679
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:24,200
They stole the Eye of the Dragon!

680
01:13:28,870 --> 01:13:32,330
Don't harm the Eye of the Dragon!

681
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:37,740
Ai!

682
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:51,910
Give back what you stole.

683
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:57,820
Kill them!

684
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:11,160
I've finally caught you, Cat's Eye.

685
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:13,580
Now I can marry Hitomi.

686
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:17,470
Hitomi?

687
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:21,090
This can't be...

688
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:23,730
There's no way...

689
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:29,330
Did you expect me to go that way?

690
01:15:29,330 --> 01:15:31,330
I already told you,

691
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:33,630
Disguises won't fool me.

692
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:37,280
And Hitomi's eyes
aren't so evil!

693
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:38,520
Who the hell are you?

694
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:46,610
Cat's Eye, you're under arrest for
Serial Burglary Charges.

695
01:15:46,610 --> 01:15:48,110
Oh?

696
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:48,950
Really?

697
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:50,950
Why?

698
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,630
Come on, boy.

699
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:10,950
What?

700
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:38,040
The Eye of the Dragon is
mine at last.

701
01:16:45,990 --> 01:16:46,670
Nice catch.

702
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,010
What the heck is this?

703
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:49,180
I have to ask you quite
a lot of questions, Miss Wong.

704
01:17:59,210 --> 01:18:01,280
You want to shoot me?

705
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:02,260
Come on!

706
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:17,440
You will never touch me!

707
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,030
Let's leave the rest to Hitomi.

708
01:18:56,190 --> 01:18:57,920
What's this?

709
01:19:03,130 --> 01:19:04,820
Shit!

710
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:06,880
Damn cat again.

711
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:10,720
Okay, Miss Wong...

712
01:19:11,950 --> 01:19:13,710
Take us to our father.
Right Now!

713
01:19:14,780 --> 01:19:15,910
Or he's dead!

714
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:19,160
Your father?

715
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:29,550
Okay, let me tell you
where your father is.

716
01:20:45,710 --> 01:20:46,640
It's okay...

717
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:52,380
I've...

718
01:20:56,050 --> 01:20:57,850
killed too many...

719
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:17,930
Lee-kun!

720
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:04,270
This is the father you've
been looking for.

721
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:10,560
Don't search for your father.

722
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,560
I won't run!

723
01:22:29,310 --> 01:22:30,780
A secret about Father?

724
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:14,670
Father!

725
01:24:18,150 --> 01:24:19,210
Father!

726
01:24:36,820 --> 01:24:38,390
Hitomi...

727
01:24:38,390 --> 01:24:40,240
Father is in the helicopter, correct?

728
01:24:47,430 --> 01:24:48,950
Neesan...

729
01:25:10,670 --> 01:25:12,050
Mother...

730
01:25:13,690 --> 01:25:16,570
Black Flag! Why?

731
01:25:18,690 --> 01:25:21,130
Black Flag!

732
01:25:21,130 --> 01:25:22,540
Black Flag!

733
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:30,990
Goodbye,

734
01:25:30,990 --> 01:25:31,560
Ai-san.

735
01:25:42,290 --> 01:25:43,560
Lee-kun!

736
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:00,300
This is Asatani Mitsuko
of INTERPOL.

737
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:02,550
The Ko-Ryu-Dan are getting
away in a helicopter.

738
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:05,010
Please track their course.

739
01:26:08,220 --> 01:26:09,690
We'll meet again,

740
01:26:09,690 --> 01:26:10,940

741
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:26,120
What the hell is going on here?

742
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:27,120
What's this ball anyway?

743
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:28,840
Detective Utsumi.

744
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:29,470
Huh?

745
01:26:29,470 --> 01:26:31,070
Cat's Eye is over there.

746
01:26:31,070 --> 01:26:31,970
What?

747
01:26:33,610 --> 01:26:35,400
Hey!

748
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:37,090
I won't let you get away!

749
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:06,910
