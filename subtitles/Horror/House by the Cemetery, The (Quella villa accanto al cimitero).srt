00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,410
My mom must be very busy.

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,010
It's near here, so I'll take you.

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,410
Thanks.

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,710
By the way, how did you recognize me?

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,210
Seonhui sent me your photo once.

7
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,650
Seonhui's a nice person, isn't she?

8
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,550
My mom's always nice.

9
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,680
Was she the same when she was a child?

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,510
I'm so curious about her childhood.

11
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,380
She was the same.

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,280
She did everything for the younger kids.

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,310
She was smart and a good student.

14
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,480
She looked like a spoiled rich kid,

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,110
but her actions were the exact opposite.

16
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,010
Just like how she is now.

17
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,010
You really love your mom, don't you?

18
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,840
Because she's my mom.

19
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,350
Right. She's your mom.

20
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,810
Jeongae.

21
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,350
Seonhui.

22
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,840
Did you come to greet me?

23
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,510
How did you know?

24
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,410
Goodbye.

25
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,910
Thank you for bringing me.

26
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,080
Sure.

27
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:46,240
I really don't know what you're thinking.

28
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,310
If you're going to tell Eunsu...

29
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,880
What are you so afraid about?

30
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,840
Do you know how you look right now?

31
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,880
As if you're afraid of your precious jewel

32
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,610
being taken away or broken.

33
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,280
Eunsu's your daughter.

34
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,910
Just make her your daughter.

35
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,410
She completely believes you're her mom.

36
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,910
So what could I possibly say to her?

37
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,480
I'll have to leave her be.

38
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,210
That's what she wants, so I'll have to let her be.

39
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,910
Don't worry, Seonhui.

40
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,740
What could change?

41
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,180
Nothing.

42
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,450
I'll let you live as you have been.

43
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,610
Happy?

44
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,480
Why did she come looking for me

45
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,980
and make this happen?

46
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,880
She should've let me live in hiding.

47
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,350
What is it, mom?

48
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,510
Well, I...

49
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,140
About earlier.

50
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,280
Yes?

51
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,240
What did you talk about with my friend?

52
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,110
Something you never tell me.

53
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,450
What is it?

54
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,710
What?

55
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,280
She said you looked like a spoiled rich kid

56
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,740
when you were little.

57
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,680
What?

58
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,610
You were a good student and smart, but

59
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,740
your actions were the opposite. Very clumsy.

60
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,650
How come you never changed?

61
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,940
You didn't talk about anything else?

62
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,380
No, we didn't.

63
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,180
Yes, to find out who Jiwan's date is.

64
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,780
I'd have to be like a detective.

65
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,240
Why is everyone so interested in

66
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,550
Jiwan's love life?

67
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,210
Should I come, too?

68
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,580
I couldn't.

69
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,180
No, I won't.

70
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,780
Kang Yeongju, why are you here?

71
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,450
What about you? Why are you here?

72
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,310
I should ask you both the same!

73
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,450
You're tailing Jiwan on your day off,

74
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,010
so how could I stay home?

75
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,010
I'm trying my best to turn this

76
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:11,040
into an actual date, but you!

77
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,550
You ruined it! You did!

78
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:15,140
To me this is a valuable experience!

79
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,880
Things like tailing and staking out

80
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,450
can be important experience for my writing.

81
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,310
You're the one who's in my way!

82
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,980
What a funny notion!

83
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,450
You'd go see a ghost to write a horror novel?

84
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,010
Be quiet!

85
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,280
Get out of my way!

86
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,780
Hey!

87
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,180
He really was meeting Ms. Seo?

88
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,010
What kind of co-workers are that close?

89
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,810
Jiwan's really seeing that witch?

90
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,650
Why, I ought to...

91
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,480
- Stay still. 
 - Why?

92
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,210
Well...

93
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,980
Co-workers could do that for each other.

94
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,810
Of course.

95
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,980
Co-workers can do...

96
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,110
Stuff like that...

97
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,180
Not!

98
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,080
Jiwan! I'm against this flirting!

99
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,110
What are you doing? You want them to see us?

100
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,740
They're co-workers,

101
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,610
so why did they come to a hotel?

102
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,350
I don't know.

103
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,480
It must be about work.

104
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,940
What kind of co-workers

105
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:10,980
come to a hotel together?

106
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,710
They must be mad! In broad daylight!

107
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,410
Kim Jiwan!

108
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,580
What are you doing here?

109
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,880
Well, I...

110
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:31,080
I was passing by, and...

111
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,910
I was walking by, and...

112
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:37,140
This is where the launching show will be?

113
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,080
I thought you were on a date...

114
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,510
You were working.

115
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,010
You were working hard. It's great.

116
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,310
That's a very awkward laugh.

117
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:19,710
So they are just co-workers.

118
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:24,680
You can tell your family they are co-workers.

119
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,280
It wasn't Ms. Seo.

120
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,240
They were just working.

121
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,450
They are co-workers.

122
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,510
Nothing more, nothing less.

123
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,350
But I'm never wrong.

124
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,410
How odd.

125
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:41,510
Really?

126
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,080
They did nothing outside work?

127
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,480
Nothing.

128
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,650
Okay...

129
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,610
No, they're not dating.

130
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,740
They're just co-workers.

131
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,140
Co-workers.

132
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,350
Oh, Eunsu's not answering her phone.

133
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:33,240
I should call Jiwan, then.

134
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,040
Yes, of course.

135
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,740
Jiwan.

136
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,780
Hi, Yeongju.

137
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,080
Are you with Eunsu right now?

138
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,940
No.

139
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,010
I'm working because of the launching show.

140
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,710
Oh, I see.

141
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,140
When are you going home?

142
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,840
I'm on my way.

143
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:58,140
I hear the shaved ice at

144
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,040
the cafe you frequent is good.

145
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,650
Yes, their coffee and shaved ice are all good.

146
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,110
I should go there, then.

147
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,380
Okay.

148
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,410
Honey, what should we have for dinner?

149
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,840
Spring vegetables are in season.

150
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,480
Should I make some dishes?

151
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,780
It's okay.

152
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,450
Let's just eat whatever we have.

153
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,350
It's dinner time. Where are you going?

154
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,350
Mom, I'll be right back.

155
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,910
Have dinner without me.

156
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,980
Honey, did you see her?

157
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,880
I did.

158
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,880
Why did she get all dressed up?

159
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,610
I'm suspicious of her.

160
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,180
Maybe she went out to meet a man.

161
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,550
Jiwan.

162
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,380
When did you get here?

163
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,810
Hi, Yeongju.

164
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,110
Were you at a wedding?

165
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,140
What?

166
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,550
I was on my way home...

167
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,710
You're having shaved ice and coffee alone?

168
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,940
What?

169
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,450
I'm not alone.

170
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,310
What?

171
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,880
We're having a launching show

172
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,680
at the Da Vinci Hotel near here.

173
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,980
We've been there to check it out.

174
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:45,880
I see.

175
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,550
You want to join us?

176
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:51,940
No, I came in because I saw you.

177
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,040
I should go.

178
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,980
Okay...

179
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,310
Co-workers can have shaved ice together.

180
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,140
It was a hot day today.

181
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:37,680
But why are they eating at my seat?

182
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,510
Those cookies.

183
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,450
Yes?

184
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,080
Don't ever make them again.

185
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,710
What?

186
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,650
What kind of cookies were they?

187
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:01,240
They were all broken, sweet and bitter.

188
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,080
How could you be so bad at it?

189
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,680
Don't ever make them again.

190
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,280
You can't bake.

191
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:10,210
Fine. I'll never make them again.

192
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,110
And don't ever get hurt again.

193
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,880
You've worn this all day, right?

194
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,450
It's time to change it.

195
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,350
What's wrong with you?

196
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,980
You get scratches, fall down or burn yourself.

197
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,040
Stop getting hurt.

198
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,280
It bothers me.

199
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,280
Don't let it bother you.

200
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,580
Then make sure I won't be bothered.

201
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,410
You should be more careful.

202
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,410
I like shaved ice, too.

203
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,410
Yeongju.

204
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,040
Open this door.

205
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,680
Why was your mascara running?

206
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,810
Were you crying?

207
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,040
Leave her alone.

208
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,210
She wants to be alone.

209
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,650
Did she grow up alone?

210
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,350
I raised her when she was growing up,

211
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,880
so why does she want to be left alone now?

212
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,880
Yeongju!

213
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,210
Open this door! Tell me what it is!

214
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,110
Why are you crying?

215
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:59,110
You want me to die of frustration?

216
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,180
What's going on?

217
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,980
What is it? Tell me so we can resolve it.

218
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,550
What is it?

219
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,380
My foot...

220
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,650
What?

221
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,480
What's wrong with your foot?

222
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,080
I got a blister.

223
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,680
What? Your foot looks fine.

224
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,080
Oh, that looks like it hurts.

225
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,240
Does that happen when you wear heels?

226
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,610
Why didn't you wear your normal shoes?

227
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,040
I knew you were making a mistake.

228
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:41,080
Why did you do that? Just be yourself.

229
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,210
Right.

230
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,580
I should just be myself...

231
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:06,940
What are you talking about?

232
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:10,210
Eunsu framed someone of plagiarism to win?

233
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,650
I don't know why people are saying that.

234
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:15,980
I think it started at Design.

235
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,880
I've been ignoring it because it's false,

236
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,450
but it's gotten out of control.

237
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,910
Out of control? How?

238
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:23,940
They're saying Hyeondo's got her back.

239
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,380
That's nonsense.

240
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,880
Hyeondo's the one who

241
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,550
discovered the plagiarism,

242
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,580
and that's probably why people assume that.

243
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,650
People in Design spread that rumor?

244
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,280
Would you like this?

245
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,280
It's okay.

246
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,710
You never say yes to anything I give you.

247
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:20,810
That girl over there.

248
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,210
They framed the winner for

249
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,580
plagiarism to make her win.

250
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,980
She must know some powerful people.

251
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,450
She's got no experience or a degree.

252
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,040
Everyone thought it was weird.

253
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,280
Really?

254
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,480
Everyone in Design is waiting

255
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,810
for the right moment to get her.

256
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,650
I'm sorry.

257
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:55,580
Are you all right?

258
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,940
Yes, I'm all right.

259
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,210
I'm sorry.

260
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,240
Oh, no.

261
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,780
Everyone's watching, so just go.

262
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,650
Hyeondo.

263
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,380
Who cares if anyone's watching?

264
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,710
Did you commit a crime?

265
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:30,610
Why do you care about what others think?

266
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,480
Thank you.

267
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,710
Didn't I tell you to lower

268
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,350
the company logo by 2mm?

269
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:53,110
You didn't mention the company logo.

270
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,780
You just mentioned the product logo.

271
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:00,350
If you lower just one logo, it ruins the balance.

272
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,650
Do I have to point out everything?

273
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,980
It's the basics!

274
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,810
I'm sorry. I'll do it again.

275
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,980
You didn't check for typos?

276
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:13,110
I checked many times. There can't be any...

277
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,940
Pull yourself together!

278
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,550
Don't you dare tell anyone you won the contest

279
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,410
if you're going to do a subpar job.

280
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,710
Get what I tell you done right!

281
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:25,650
Must I point out every single detail?

282
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,110
Aren't you ashamed of getting paid?

283
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,480
Kim Jiwan!

284
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,550
Come with me.

285
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,380
Let go!

286
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,280
Why did you drag me out from there?

287
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,780
Didn't you hear what she said?

288
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,840
She wasn't wrong.

289
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:41,580
Being yelled at is a process of learning.

290
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,810
It's not just anyone. It's your little sister.

291
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,710
How can you be neutral about your sister?

292
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,350
How could you do that?

293
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,110
Then, what will you say?

294
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,480
You're going to use your father's position

295
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,740
and threaten Ms. Bae?

296
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,880
Why can't I use my father's position?

297
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,380
Everyone knows I'm the owner's son.

298
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,840
What about Eunsu, then?

299
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,880
You want people to think

300
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,210
she got hired because of you?

301
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,280
But that's not true.

302
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,040
When everyone says it's true, it will seem so

303
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,240
even if it isn't.

304
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,010
Kim Jiwan!

305
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,550
I'm angrier than you!

306
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,140
Don't you know your doing this puts

307
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,780
Eunsu at a more difficult position?

308
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,550
But I can't just sit and watch.

309
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,110
Eunsu will take care of it.

310
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,880
She can take care of it by herself.

311
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:24,450
Let's not get involved, making it more difficult.

312
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,910
I've seen plenty of kids like you

313
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,410
who get hired using connections.

314
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,610
Do you know how annoying it is to have

315
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,480
the likes of you ruin our reputation?

316
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:36,880
Get out!

317
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,910
You don't need to work here.

318
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,780
You have great connections. Why work at all?

319
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,310
You'll get paid and get promoted anyway.

320
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,010
I said get out!

321
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,880
Are you deaf?

322
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,240
What are you doing?

323
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:58,080
Please check these again.

324
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,740
I'll learn and get getter.

325
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,010
I'll work harder to make up

326
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,710
for my shortcomings.

327
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,280
I'll study all night if I don't know something,

328
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,740
so I can catch up very quickly.

329
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,010
But...

330
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:15,010
Don't insult me for something

331
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,580
that's not work-related.

332
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:23,210
I won the contest fair and square.

333
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:26,210
I never relied on anyone to get this job.

334
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:26,780
Hey!

335
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,080
And...

336
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,350
I checked them dozens of times.

337
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,010
There are no typos.

338
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:39,280
Please check them again.

339
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,380
I'll check them, and we'll talk again.

340
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,910
You're really worried about Eunsu, aren't you?

341
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:29,450
It's hard for me to let it go easily,

342
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,410
since she's my little sister and all.

343
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:34,010
Eunsu's doing a good job.

344
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,410
She's worthy of being your sister.

345
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,710
Thank you.

346
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,240
But I'm worried.

347
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,010
Rumors can be quite vicious.

348
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:49,380
Rumors are just rumors.

349
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:54,240
Eunsu will get though it.

350
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,240
Just like you did.

351
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,110
How do you know so well?

352
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,450
I can tell.

353
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,280
You two are very similar.

354
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,580
But...

355
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,040
How did you know I was here?

356
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:14,110
Are you following me around?

357
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,240
Follow...

358
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:31,350
Jiwan, shouldn't you get back to work?

359
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,550
It's a personal loan.

360
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:51,180
You've met this month's quota.

361
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,740
Good job.

362
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,380
Honey.

363
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,310
Honey, I'm home.

364
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,610
What is it?

365
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,110
You're home?

366
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,580
Oh, my, honey, what are you doing?

367
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,510
What's going on?

368
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,240
Take that off right now.

369
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,910
Just sit here. I'm almost done.

370
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,040
Don't come in.

371
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,280
Don't even come near.

372
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,980
I'm going to finish what I started.

373
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:21,650
Finish what?

374
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:25,510
He's going to leave me lots of dishes to wash.

375
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,810
What?

376
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,140
Red ginseng?

377
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:44,610
Happy Marriage Day
Thank you. I'm sorry!

378
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,510
Why couldn't he write a bit more?

379
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:51,080
One line? That's it?

380
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,580
Oh, there's so much to eat.

381
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,910
Right?

382
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,310
Here.

383
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,780
- Enjoy. 
 - Okay.

384
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,840
It looks good.

385
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,180
Let me see...

386
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:22,010
You bought this at the market, right?

387
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:26,980
And this came from Yeongcheol's Side Dishes.

388
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,510
Hansik's makes better

389
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,110
side dishes than Yeongcheol's.

390
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,310
This was $5, right?

391
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,450
At Hansik's, it's $4.

392
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,940
If you keep doing this,

393
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,010
I won't want to do this for you again.

394
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,610
Oh, really? Why, I'm sorry, honey.

395
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:47,840
So don't ever do this again, okay?

396
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,380
Okay.

397
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,450
Now that you said that, I know I must.

398
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,980
Honey, what's going on?

399
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,350
Did something nice happen today?

400
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,810
A gift and dinner? What is it?

401
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:02,240
I can't buy you luxury brand bags anymore,

402
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,740
so I have to look after your health.

403
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:08,140
If you get sick, I'll be the one who suffers.

404
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,510
Oh, whatever.

405
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:18,710
When your job gets too hard, you must quit.

406
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,510
Just promise me that.

407
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,580
It's not like you're having it easy.

408
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,240
They must be pressuring you

409
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,650
to meet the quota.

410
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,610
No.

411
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:28,550
I've already met this month's quota.

412
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,550
I won't have to worry about it for a while.

413
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,940
Really?

414
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:32,980
Honey, I'm so happy for you!

415
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,210
That's great! I'm so happy for you.

416
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:37,940
Don't worry.

417
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,310
You two are home already?

418
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,180
Dad, you came home earl...

419
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,040
Please continue.

420
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,350
I'll leave you two alone.

421
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,480
Don't say that.

422
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,110
Come and have dinner.

423
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,680
It looks like I might get a little sibling.

424
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:55,180
What did she say?

425
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,610
Maybe she feels better now.

426
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,110
She didn't tell you what

427
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,940
the other night was about, did she?

428
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,680
Minja.

429
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:07,880
Don't worry about your kid tonight

430
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,710
and enjoy your dinner.

431
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:12,580
Okay, Jaecheol.

432
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,010
You eat, too.

433
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:15,280
Try them.

434
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:45,180
Hyeondo, I'm used to drinking soju by itself,

435
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,680
but you're all about style,

436
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,650
so why are you drinking like this?

437
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,210
If your mom sees you,

438
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,450
she'll say it's because you take after me.

439
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:58,240
Is something bothering you?

440
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:02,840
Oh, you gave me back my car,

441
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,880
so why would anything bother me?

442
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,180
But if you gave me back my credit card...

443
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:11,080
Really? I can take your car away again.

444
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,780
You want it?

445
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,810
Really?

446
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:19,980
Now, I'm sure there's something bothering you.

447
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,040
Have you ever held yourself back for mom?

448
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:33,140
I do that every day.

449
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:40,380
Doing nothing for the sake of the other person.

450
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,610
How does that make sense?

451
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:47,550
I did something for someone,

452
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:51,450
but it turned out, I did it for myself.

453
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,550
Well...

454
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,180
I'm not sure who the other person is, but

455
00:28:55,180 --> 00:29:00,210
she's amazing for making you think this way.

456
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,740
If it took that much thought to decide,

457
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:08,110
whatever that is, you're doing it for her.

458
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,810
The girl you're seeing right now,

459
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:12,310
if she makes you think this hard,

460
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:15,010
she must be worth it. Yes.

461
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:17,310
I don't know who it is, but I'm all for her,

462
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,550
so just bring her and let me meet her.

463
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,610
Okay.

464
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,180
I'll bring her home soon to meet you.

465
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,810
If you used half the energy you use on that girl

466
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:28,650
at work, you'd be doing twice as better.

467
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:33,040
That was why I married your mom so early.

468
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,840
So I can focus on work.

469
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:40,910
What about mom do you love so much?

470
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:43,210
I mean, she's my mom, so I put up with her,

471
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,810
but if she were my wife, well...

472
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:48,510
Stay away from my wife!

473
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,450
You can't see how attractive she is

474
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:51,680
because she's your mom.

475
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,710
I would never get sick of that woman.

476
00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:00,350
Like mom said, she is your first and only love?

477
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,880
An unrealistically hopeless romantic

478
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,550
who married his first love?

479
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,740
Don't you dare!

480
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,480
Don't drink too much. Go to bed.

481
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,880
Whoa, you are!

482
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,740
Mom was telling the truth.

483
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,350
You're like one of the handful of men

484
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,010
whose been with only one woman!

485
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,080
Goodnight, Mr. Hopeless Romantic!

486
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,010
Hi.

487
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,580
Are you all right?

488
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,650
Of course.

489
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:16,480
Ms. Bae gave me a compliment today.

490
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,550
I'm going to work even harder.

491
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:27,080
I'm not going to use inexperience as an excuse.

492
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,740
I'm going to work harder, and prove to them

493
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:33,880
I won the contest with my talent,

494
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:39,450
so will you watch me from afar?

495
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:44,380
Don't be too friendly, don't try to step up.

496
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,040
If you keep trying to help me,

497
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:50,080
I'd want to rely on you.

498
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,080
Sure.

499
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:57,780
I won't be friendly at work anymore.

500
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:00,610
You're not angry, are you?

501
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,010
I'm hanging up.

502
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:13,080
He is angry.

503
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,110
Excuse me.

504
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,010
Who are you?

505
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:26,980
It's okay.

506
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,080
Oh.

507
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,450
Hello, Mr. Shin.

508
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,550
We meet again.

509
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:37,580
It's me. Haengsuk.

510
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,380
We met in front of Seonhui's restaurant.

511
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,840
Oh, hello.

512
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:48,610
I thought it might be you.

513
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:51,240
What brings you here?

514
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:53,980
Actually,

515
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:57,410
I've been working near here for a while now.

516
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:01,580
At the porridge place over there.

517
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,550
Please drop by sometime.

518
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:08,740
I'll make you delicious porridge.

519
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,510
I'll try.

520
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,910
Goodbye.

521
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:26,210
Front and back, he's my type.

522
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,940
Front and back, he's just dark everywhere.

523
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,580
This customer?

524
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,550
Yes?

525
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:42,010
Oh, the yam porridge?

526
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,880
He paid.

527
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,650
This customer,

528
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,480
why do you think he didn't finish it?

529
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:51,810
Because he didn't want to finish it.

530
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,680
Why didn't he want to finish it?

531
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,240
How would I know?

532
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:59,040
Maybe he was full, or maybe it tasted...

533
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:07,040
Next time, ask why they didn't finish.

534
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:08,180
Yes, sir.

535
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,910
Whoa.

536
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:38,910
What took you so long?

537
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,580
Oh, right.

538
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:42,180
You tend to come here in the evening.

539
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,040
Why did you come back?

540
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,140
Because I get more ideas when I come here.

541
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,080
For some reason, I can focus better.

542
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,350
Maybe they have good feng shui.

543
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:54,350
When I see you, I don't want to work anymore.

544
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:58,240
Don't stay stuff like that in front of me.

545
00:34:58,250 --> 00:34:59,740
I have a temper, too, if I'm mad.

546
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,080
Say it to my face!

547
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,180
A man shouldn't mumble.

548
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:07,550
Why would she say that? How offensive.

549
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,740
And a writer shouldn't be a sexist.

550
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,810
No wonder people say her script is old.

551
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,610
I can hear you.

552
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,310
Jiwan!

553
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,680
Hi.

554
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,010
Oh, he looks nice in a suit.

555
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:24,280
You're here again?

556
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,140
This place must be great for writing.

557
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,880
By the way, who is he?

558
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,010
Your boyfriend?

559
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:30,740
No.

560
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:31,680
Hello.

561
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,580
I'm Yeongju's friend's older brother, Kim Jiwan.

562
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,810
Hello, I'm Heo Seonggeun.

563
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:37,210
It's nice to meet you.

564
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:39,310
He's not my boyfriend.

565
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,680
I said he's not my boyfriend.

566
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,180
Why would you think he's my boyfriend?

567
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,010
If he's standing with me, he's my boyfriend?

568
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:48,480
Shouldn't you at least ask me who he is?

569
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,450
You just jump to "boyfriend" when you see

570
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:52,980
a man standing next to me...

571
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:01,680
Uh...

572
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,080
I made a mistake.

573
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:05,980
It's okay.

574
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,240
I've been going through something.

575
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,380
Goodbye.

576
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:13,740
You're so insensitive.

577
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,780
Insensitive...

578
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,410
That was him, right?

579
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:27,580
Against 4 men! Looks great in suits.

580
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,710
The untamed!

581
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,840
The man in your script.

582
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,580
You have a major crush on him, right?

583
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,280
You could tell?

584
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,040
It was so obvious.

585
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,550
Everyone except one person knows.

586
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,080
Things like that are obvious to

587
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,450
the people around,

588
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:44,940
but not to the people involved.

589
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,310
When you're absorbed

590
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:47,980
in your emotions, you can't see.

591
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,480
Is it fun for you?

592
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:51,740
Yes.

593
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,140
What a jerk...

594
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:56,780
That's why your script was full of emotions.

595
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:01,940
I thought about what I loved about your script.

596
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,610
And I loved how

597
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:06,550
the female character saw the male character.

598
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,810
She was in so much pain

599
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,650
that I wanted to console her

600
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:11,880
and tell her not to hurt anymore.

601
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:17,110
Your crush is very useful for you!

602
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,080
See?

603
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,980
When you experience it, it becomes real.

604
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,480
You're like a con artist.

605
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:29,280
Let's talk business, shall we?

606
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,880
Hi, Yeongju.

607
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,140
Hi, Eunsu.

608
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:43,480
Did Jiwan say anything?

609
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,940
No, is something wrong?

610
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:48,940
I was a bit rude to him.

611
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,310
Can we meet today?

612
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,810
We can't, not for a while.

613
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:55,140
I'm busy getting ready for the launching show.

614
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,310
You are?

615
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,650
Are you sure you're busy?

616
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,650
It's not that jerk who's keeping you busy?

617
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:03,040
Don't call him a "jerk."

618
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:06,180
I'm sad enough because my mom hates him.

619
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,210
Your mom knows how to read people.

620
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:10,680
Of course she must hate him.

621
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,650
Are you cursing your friend's love life?

622
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:14,840
I'm busy. Bye.

623
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,080
Oh, talk about being blinded by love.

624
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,610
Eunsu has a boyfriend?

625
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,550
Mom!

626
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,410
Ever heard of knocking?

627
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:31,910
You keep doing this every day.

628
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,210
If you're not hiding anything,

629
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:35,380
why are you so surprised?

630
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:38,110
Who is it? He's a jerk?

631
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:41,380
You heard me.

632
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,240
Why? Is he that bad?

633
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:45,910
Eunsu doesn't have good taste in men.

634
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,940
How bad is this one?

635
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,310
It's not like that.

636
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:52,380
It's just that he can be flippant,

637
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,510
but you...

638
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:07,380
What is it? Is he someone I know?

639
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,580
No. How could you know him?

640
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,680
You're hiding something from me, aren't you?

641
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,380
You've been doing that a lot!

642
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,650
Why did you come home crying

643
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,980
the other night? You're not going to tell me?

644
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:22,580
Do I have to get your permission to cry?

645
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,010
Eunsu's boyfriend?

646
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,680
No, she doesn't have one.

647
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,580
She'd tell me if she had a boyfriend.

648
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,910
Maybe she didn't tell you

649
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,940
because something's wrong with him.

650
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:39,240
I'm saying this because I sympathize.

651
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,580
Why do you think I pay

652
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,410
so much attention to Yeongju?

653
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:45,450
What if that naive girl meets someone weird?

654
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:47,240
I couldn't handle that.

655
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:48,740
She doesn't.

656
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:51,450
You know she's been so busy with work

657
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:53,110
after winning the contest.

658
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:55,940
She has no time to meet anyone.

659
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,210
Is he from work?

660
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:01,510
Maybe they just met recently.

661
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,410
I heard he's flippant.

662
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,810
But then again, for your family,

663
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:08,580
that might be good.

664
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:14,550
What is it? You have someone in mind?

665
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,410
No, I don't.

666
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,140
That's the party room.

667
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:28,350
Why did I think of Hyeondo?

668
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,510
Hyeondo must be really flippant.

669
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,880
I thought of him when I heard the word.

670
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,840
The new product launching show's tomorrow?

671
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:44,210
Is it going well?

672
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:45,780
It's not like they've never done this.

673
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,080
They are all veterans.

674
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,510
I'm sure they'll do a good job.

675
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,710
Here.

676
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:53,010
Your favorite, roasted rice tea.

677
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:56,450
You sure have cheap taste.

678
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,080
You seemed bothered by something

679
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,180
for a while, but these days, you look peaceful.

680
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,380
Things aren't bad.

681
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,140
Troubles have been sorted out,

682
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:12,580
the company's doing well,

683
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,810
and Hyeondo seems to have grown up.

684
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:18,510
On top of that, you've become sweet.

685
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,240
I've been too good to you lately, haven't I?

686
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:26,010
You must feel guilty about something.

687
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:27,350
If you're unhappy,

688
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:29,710
you can move out of my room.

689
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:32,210
I don't know what it is,

690
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:34,710
but don't let me find out.

691
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:38,110
I like how you are right now.

692
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,180
You won't believe me if I tell you it's nothing.

693
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:45,910
Sure, I won't let you find out.

694
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:47,280
You can be so nasty.

695
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,280
You're unhappy when I'm nice to you.

696
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,010
Come by my office tomorrow.

697
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,480
I'll buy you a new car.

698
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:55,110
Really?

699
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,410
You weren't just saying that

700
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:59,040
in front of Mr. Park's wife?

701
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:02,110
Whatever it was, I said it, so I must keep it.

702
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,040
Oh, how lucky I am!

703
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:08,210
I know you deserve it.

704
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:10,580
While I crawled my way up,

705
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,910
you crawled up with me.

706
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:14,840
You actually know that?

707
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:19,940
After meeting you, I had a hard life.

708
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:24,140
After meeting you, I had a hard life, too.

709
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:26,940
Marrying once is hard enough,

710
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,680
so I wonder how those men who marry

711
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,880
two or three times actually manage it.

712
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:34,040
You envy them?

713
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:36,080
Why don't you learn from Mr. Park?

714
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:44,410
Wow, look how my design changed...

715
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:49,040
Eunsu, get ready before everyone gets here.

716
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:51,010
Go and get the manuals and samples.

717
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:52,940
Yes, I'll go right now.

718
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:01,350
Making the joint this way gives more support?

719
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:04,550
Eunsu, why are you still here?

720
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:06,040
I'm sorry.

721
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:09,510
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

722
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:12,650
Let's include Eunsu in the meeting.

723
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:17,380
Watching her design get developed by

724
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,610
professionals might help.

725
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:22,140
But I have to go get the samples.

726
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:22,910
We don't need them.

727
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:24,280
We don't have time. Sit down.

728
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:27,610
Sit.

729
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:30,040
Thank you.

730
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,310
Check everything you can before the show.

731
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:36,280
Mijin, what's going on with the testing booth?

732
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,840
We're setting it up so the reporters can test it.

733
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:40,010
Okay.

734
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:42,650
Jiwan, did you sort out the RSVP's?

735
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:43,810
The major media companies said

736
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:44,740
they'd be here.

737
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,380
I'll put the list up after I check them again.

738
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,550
Those who are flying in tomorrow,

739
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:50,110
I reserved pick up service for them tomorrow.

740
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:51,310
Good.

741
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:53,480
I edited the president's greeting message.

742
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,480
Okay.

743
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:56,210
I think we can give this to him.

744
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,280
Everyone!

745
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,580
Tomorrow's the day.

746
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:02,980
Don't let your guards down,

747
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,280
and check everything two or three times.

748
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,040
Got it?

749
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:06,680
- Yes, sir. 
 - Yes!

750
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:09,580
New Product Launching Presentation

751
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,310
Hyeondo, what are you doing?

752
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:17,310
You must line them up!

753
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:21,080
Put them in the right place!

754
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:31,280
Can you lower that a bit?

755
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,980
A little to the left.

756
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,680
Yes, a bit more to the left.

757
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:36,380
To the left.

758
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:42,580
Generally speaking, medical devices are

759
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:46,040
thought to be for patients or the elderly,

760
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:48,810
but our new product is for

761
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:51,550
students and younger...

762
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:02,380
I'll take the next question.

763
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:05,910
The man in the back, please go ahead.

764
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,940
Best Global's company motto is

765
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:21,210
to provide the best service using

766
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:23,380
top technology and hard work

767
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:26,940
to promote good health for mankind...

768
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:37,010
Yes...

769
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:44,780
We promise to produce and

770
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:48,110
provide world-class products.

771
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,910
The audio function is unusual,

772
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:54,040
but can you play any song you want?

773
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,580
Well, we installed the sounds of nature

774
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:04,140
to help the user relax.

775
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:08,740
But you can upload any kind of music you want.

776
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:09,840
However,

777
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:12,380
I don't recommend disco or hip-hop music.

778
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:15,510
If you get too excited and get hurt using it,

779
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:18,410
we can't be held responsible.

780
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:45,810
Hello, mother.

781
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:49,240
Well...

782
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:53,480
I think I saw Eunsu's mother here.

783
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,210
Jeongae?

784
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,650
Jeongae's there?

785
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:04,240
I was wondering if you knew...

786
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:10,380
I'll call you back.

787
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:46,010
Hello, mother.

788
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:51,140
Did Jeongae go there to meet Eunsu?

789
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:53,380
I don't know.

790
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:55,010
I was in a hurry...

791
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:56,380
Then why did Jeongae...

792
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:57,710
I think I made a mistake.

793
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:04,580
Don't worry, mother.

794
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:05,880
I have to go.

795
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:27,040
Sir.

796
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:28,040
Oh...

797
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:29,450
What are you doing here?

798
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:30,650
Aren't you in charge of the launching show?

799
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:32,140
I'm sorry.

800
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:35,140
I was looking for someone.

801
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:38,040
Did you see a woman walking this way?

802
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,010
Why do you ask?

803
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:45,210
I think we have an uninvited guest.

804
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:46,310
I was just trying to check.

805
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:48,410
No, there's nobody here.

806
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:50,040
Okay.

807
00:49:51,110 --> 00:49:54,040
By the way, what are you doing here?

808
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:56,450
Do I have to explain that to you?

809
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:58,710
No, sir. I'm sorry.

810
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:00,310
You should go.

811
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:01,650
I will.

812
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:03,110
Excuse me.

813
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:29,580
You should've met with me when I asked you.

814
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:31,280
I wasn't going to cause trouble.

815
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,010
I told you I have something to say.

816
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:35,940
After that, I won't ever show up again.

817
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:39,310
Go somewhere and wait for me.

818
00:50:39,310 --> 00:50:40,880
I'll call you when I'm finished.

819
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:43,040
Are you sure?

820
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:44,840
If you try to avoid me again,

821
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:46,350
I don't know how I'm going to react.

822
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:48,310
If you show up like this again,

823
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:49,980
I don't know how I'm going to react, either.

824
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,910
Fine.

825
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:53,550
Call me, and it better not be too late.

826
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:09,110
Excuse me!

827
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:15,040
We've met before, right?

828
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:17,180
I'm Eunsu's older brother.

829
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:22,450
Can we talk for a minute?

830
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:23,840
Well...

831
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:25,450
As long as it's not here.

832
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:30,240
I saw you when you were little.

833
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:31,680
It's been so long.

834
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,080
You grew up to be a fine young man.

835
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:36,240
You look so much like Sangjun.

836
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:38,450
You know my father, too?

837
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:40,410
We grew up in the countryside

838
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:42,310
everyone knew everyone.

839
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:45,310
As for Sangjun's family, everyone knew them.

840
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:46,780
Why did you ask to see me?

841
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,550
Did you come here for Eunsu?

842
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:53,010
Eunsu?

843
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:58,980
I heard you're Eunsu's birth mother.

844
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:03,780
Seonhui told you I'm her birth mother?

845
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,740
That's unexpected.

846
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:09,040
You're acting like you're Seonhui's real son.

847
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:13,080
Does Eunsu work here?

848
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:14,780
At the hotel?

849
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,940
Once was enough,

850
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:21,010
so why would I come see her again?

851
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:23,210
That girl...

852
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:24,680
She grew up to be a pretty young lady.

853
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:28,240
She must have a lot of admirers.

854
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:32,710
So you didn't come here for Eunsu?

855
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:35,350
Mother and I thought...

856
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:37,880
I haven't seen her for over 20 years,

857
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,780
so why would I start now?

858
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:41,840
Seonhui's so weird.

859
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:44,610
She think's everyone in the world is like her.

860
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,110
If that's the reason, I want to leave.

861
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:51,680
Why did you give Eunsu away?

862
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:56,210
Even if things were bad,

863
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:58,610
you could've come to see her.

864
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:02,080
Didn't Seonhui tell you?

865
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:08,580
I didn't leave Eunsu with Seonhui.

866
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:12,650
I abandoned her.

867
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:18,310
You're making me feel like an evil witch.

868
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:21,450
To be honest, Seonhui was a better choice.

869
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:24,940
I had no idea Sangjun would go bankrupt.

870
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:27,450
I thought about pros and cons

871
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:29,550
and abandoned Eunsu for her sake.

872
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:32,080
How could you say such a thing...

873
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:35,680
Seonhui raised you into a stuffy man.

874
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,010
Is Eunsu as stuffy as you are?

875
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:58,380
Jiwan!

876
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:00,350
They are looking for you inside.

877
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:01,650
Hurry up and go.

878
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:04,810
Are you crazy? How could you leave?

879
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:07,450
- Eunsu. 
 - Seriously,

880
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:09,040
whenever you create this kind of trouble,

881
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:10,740
I don't know how to handle it.

882
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,210
Right.

883
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,180
I'm sorry for being an irresponsible brother.

884
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:20,310
But you love having mom and me, right?

885
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:23,710
What? What are you talking about?

886
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:24,980
Hurry up and come.

887
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:49,010
Gather around, everyone in Marketing!

888
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:51,550
You've done a great job today.

889
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:53,510
Thanks to all your hard work,

890
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:56,310
the launching show went well.

891
00:54:56,310 --> 00:54:58,650
Let's enjoy today, okay?

892
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:04,350
I'm taking you all out for a drink!

893
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:11,110
Let's go.

894
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:15,380
Just like I said,

895
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:17,980
what do you think I did at that moment?

896
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:20,310
As the team leader, I couldn't sit and watch.

897
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:21,610
I stepped forward.

898
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:25,380
I hate stepping forward, but I did.

899
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:28,350
Why? Because I had no choice. Okay?

900
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:30,410
You're amazing, Mr. Yun.

901
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:33,180
By the way, Eunsu.

902
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:33,980
Yes?

903
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:34,710
What are you looking at

904
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:36,040
when I'm talking to you?

905
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:37,910
No, sir.

906
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:39,280
I'm paying attention to you.

907
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,510
See?

908
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:44,910
This is why I like you so much.

909
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:46,510
You're affable.

910
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,280
Of your friends...

911
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:53,410
Where did Jiwan go?

912
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:54,880
He had to finish something up

913
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,140
at the launching show.

914
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:59,310
- I couldn't handle it. 
 - He should've told me.

915
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:02,010
Jiwan is such a responsible person, right?

916
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:03,350
Jiwan is.

917
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:05,280
So...

918
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,740
Where was I?

919
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:08,810
I didn't know which parking lot it was.

920
00:56:08,810 --> 00:56:11,350
So what could I do to get out of this trouble?

921
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:12,910
What kind of strategy...

922
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:23,080
Mr. Jang Hyeondo

923
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:28,080
Still, how could he leave without a word?

924
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,410
Is he mad because I told him

925
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:35,240
not to be friendly at work?

926
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:40,680
He can be so petty.

927
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:09,780
Mr. Jang Hyeondo

928
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:22,380
Why did you leave early?

929
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:25,110
You told me never to be friendly at work.

930
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:28,310
Still, you didn't even look at me...

931
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:31,310
It feels better not to look at you.

932
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:35,380
Don't you miss me?

933
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:38,480
But I see you every day.

934
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:42,510
Not by passing, with other people.

935
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:43,840
Not like that.

936
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:46,350
Even just in passing,

937
00:57:46,350 --> 00:57:49,010
it's nice to see you regardless.

938
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:52,510
I don't like it.

939
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:58,550
My mom thinks you'll only last a month.

940
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:00,780
Your family thinks I'm just Jiwan's friend.

941
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:03,410
Jiwan has put off his decision on me.

942
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:07,110
And I can't be friendly with you at work.

943
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:10,010
Why does it have to be this complicated?

944
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,380
My love life has never been this complicated.

945
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:16,280
If I like someone, great. If not, it ends.

946
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,650
It used to be so simple.

947
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:21,880
So why is this so complicated?

948
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:26,650
So you're unhappy?

949
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:28,650
Yes.

950
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:30,350
I'm unhappy.

951
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:35,980
You want to end this?

952
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:49,210
I do.

953
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:55,510
I thought I could end it if I wanted to,

954
00:58:57,610 --> 00:58:59,510
but just thinking about it terrifies me.

955
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,350
Not being able to take you to places,

956
00:59:04,350 --> 00:59:07,080
not being able to do anything for you.

957
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,580
I hate all that.

958
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:14,810
But...

959
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:19,040
But even if things get complicated,

960
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:24,380
let's see how far we can go.

961
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:50,280
Your call is being forwarded to an automated...

962
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:54,940
Eunsu, why aren't you picking up?

963
00:59:55,410 --> 00:59:57,040
Call me as soon as you hear this...
