1
00:00:41,636 --> 00:00:44,801
Jessie,
you get in this house right now!

2
00:00:44,897 --> 00:00:46,336
Oh, Mom.

3
00:00:46,432 --> 00:00:48,158
Right now.

4
00:01:29,205 --> 00:01:31,219
No!

5
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,029
Who are you?

6
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,824
Well, I'm Mrs Voorhees,
an old friend of the Christys'.

7
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,044
No. They're all dead.
They're all dead.

8
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,578
I'll go look.

9
00:01:55,674 --> 00:01:58,168
Don't leave me. He'll kill you, too.

10
00:01:58,935 --> 00:02:01,237
I'm not afraid.

11
00:02:05,552 --> 00:02:07,566
No!

12
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:12,362
Did you know that a boy drowned

13
00:02:12,457 --> 00:02:15,239
the year before
those two others were killed?

14
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,924
The counsellors
weren't paying any attention.

15
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,856
They were making love
while that young boy drowned.

16
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:24,637
His name was Jason.

17
00:02:26,651 --> 00:02:30,008
I was working the day
that it happened. Preparing meals.

18
00:02:30,104 --> 00:02:32,789
Here. I was the cook.

19
00:02:32,885 --> 00:02:36,050
Jason should have been watched
every minute!

20
00:02:36,338 --> 00:02:37,392
He was...

21
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:43,147
He wasn't a very good swimmer.

22
00:02:45,161 --> 00:02:47,366
We can go now, dear.

23
00:02:53,121 --> 00:02:54,080
No!

24
00:02:54,176 --> 00:02:57,245
My sweet, innocent Jason.

25
00:02:58,491 --> 00:03:00,601
My only child.

26
00:03:00,697 --> 00:03:02,232
Jason.

27
00:03:06,931 --> 00:03:11,630
You let him drown.
You never paid any attention!

28
00:03:11,726 --> 00:03:14,699
Look at what you did to him.

29
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:18,056
Look what you did to him!

30
00:03:28,413 --> 00:03:29,852
No!

31
00:03:38,196 --> 00:03:40,305
Kill her, Mommy. Kill her.

32
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:44,813
She can't hide. No place to hide.

33
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:46,443
Get her, Mommy.

34
00:03:47,786 --> 00:03:49,320
Kill her.

35
00:03:58,911 --> 00:03:59,870
No!

36
00:05:30,787 --> 00:05:35,390
My men pulled you out of the lake.
We thought you were dead, too.

37
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:39,226
Do you remember very much?

38
00:05:39,322 --> 00:05:42,871
The boy. Is he dead, too?

39
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:46,515
- Who?
- The boy. Jason.

40
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,064
- Jason?
- In the lake.

41
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:53,708
The one who attacked me
and pulled me under the water.

42
00:05:55,338 --> 00:05:58,887
Ma'am, we didn't find any boy.

43
00:05:59,846 --> 00:06:01,572
Then he's still there.

44
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,616
God!

45
00:06:42,427 --> 00:06:43,770
Hello?

46
00:06:43,866 --> 00:06:45,976
Hi, Mom.

47
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,798
I know. I'm sorry.

48
00:06:47,894 --> 00:06:51,059
I meant to call earlier,
but I fell asleep.

49
00:06:53,264 --> 00:06:55,374
Really, I'm fine.

50
00:06:56,429 --> 00:06:59,114
I need a little time alone,
that's all.

51
00:07:03,622 --> 00:07:07,842
I know you and Dad worry,
and I appreciate that.

52
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:14,075
Come on, Mom,
we've been through all this before.

53
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:19,926
I have to put my life back together,
and this is the only way I know how.

54
00:07:24,241 --> 00:07:25,776
Look...

55
00:07:25,872 --> 00:07:29,804
Mom, please. It's late,
and I don't want to get into it.

56
00:07:30,859 --> 00:07:33,736
I'll call you tomorrow. Bye.

57
00:08:51,418 --> 00:08:52,857
Mom!

58
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,158
Hello?

59
00:11:02,423 --> 00:11:04,341
Cute.

60
00:11:04,437 --> 00:11:07,410
You want something to eat?

61
00:13:20,237 --> 00:13:24,553
Keep your eyes peeled.
I think we're getting close.

62
00:13:28,964 --> 00:13:31,266
There's the gas station.

63
00:13:46,802 --> 00:13:49,104
OK, let's call Ted.

64
00:14:02,818 --> 00:14:05,408
Hey, Teddy, buddy!

65
00:14:05,504 --> 00:14:08,381
We just rolled in.
Yeah, Sandra's here.

66
00:14:08,477 --> 00:14:09,915
Hi, Ted!

67
00:14:10,011 --> 00:14:12,121
You gonna come get us or what?

68
00:14:12,217 --> 00:14:14,423
Yeah, OK. Give me the directions.

69
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:18,738
Here, wait. Alright.
OK, go ahead, I'm writing.

70
00:14:18,834 --> 00:14:22,958
Alright, Old North Road,
and then look for a Dairy Queen?

71
00:14:23,054 --> 00:14:24,972
OK. And then over...

72
00:14:25,068 --> 00:14:26,411
I told the others.

73
00:14:26,507 --> 00:14:28,904
They didn't believe me.

74
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,302
You're all doomed.

75
00:14:40,317 --> 00:14:42,618
What? No, nothing, no.

76
00:14:42,714 --> 00:14:43,961
No, go ahead.

77
00:14:44,057 --> 00:14:47,510
Alright. So... covered bridge.

78
00:14:47,606 --> 00:14:50,579
OK. Then what?

79
00:14:50,674 --> 00:14:54,127
Alright, then past an old cemetery.

80
00:14:54,223 --> 00:14:56,141
And then...

81
00:14:56,237 --> 00:14:59,594
left down an old dirt road
for half a mile.

82
00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:02,279
Oh, my God! They're towing us!

83
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,005
Shit! I'll call you back.

84
00:15:04,101 --> 00:15:06,882
- Wait!
- Mister!

85
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,732
This is my truck! Come on!

86
00:15:14,746 --> 00:15:15,993
Asshole!

87
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:21,556
Shit!

88
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:36,229
Welcome to God's country.

89
00:15:37,188 --> 00:15:38,531
You ratshit!

90
00:15:43,038 --> 00:15:44,093
Thanks, Max!

91
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,162
Max owns the gas station.
He's crazy, too.

92
00:15:47,258 --> 00:15:49,368
I should have known.

93
00:15:49,464 --> 00:15:52,149
It's great to see you.
It'll be like old times.

94
00:15:52,245 --> 00:15:54,642
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

95
00:15:54,738 --> 00:15:56,273
Help me load my gear.

96
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:03,370
So, Ted, what's the scoop?

97
00:16:03,466 --> 00:16:07,398
I know that guy Paul
that's running the course. He's OK.

98
00:16:07,494 --> 00:16:11,522
He's kind of macho, though.
Takes the whole thing seriously.

99
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:14,303
Senior Camp Counsellor Course.

100
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,468
We'll probably get
a Brownie badge if we survive.

101
00:16:17,563 --> 00:16:18,714
If we survive?

102
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,208
That's right.
You're second assistant.

103
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:23,701
Oh, no!

104
00:16:24,852 --> 00:16:26,003
Wait, listen.

105
00:16:26,099 --> 00:16:29,168
There's a bear and a rabbit
in the woods taking a dump.

106
00:16:29,264 --> 00:16:33,388
"The bear says to the rabbit,
""Does shit stick to your fur?"""

107
00:16:33,388 --> 00:16:36,457
"The rabbit says, ""No, Mr Bear."""

108
00:16:36,552 --> 00:16:39,334
So the bear wiped his ass
with the rabbit.

109
00:16:41,731 --> 00:16:43,074
What is that?

110
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:58,610
- Where'd this sucker come from?
- I don't know. Let's move it.

111
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,118
This place is spooky.

112
00:17:04,844 --> 00:17:08,680
- Somebody dragged it here.
- But what for?

113
00:17:21,627 --> 00:17:23,737
You guys, look at this.

114
00:17:29,396 --> 00:17:31,026
Camp Blood.

115
00:17:31,122 --> 00:17:35,246
- It's on the same lake as we're on.
- Camp Blood?

116
00:17:35,342 --> 00:17:37,739
- Let's go.
- Can't we take a look?

117
00:17:37,835 --> 00:17:39,849
- No way.
- What's the problem?

118
00:17:39,945 --> 00:17:43,206
You don't want to know.
Not before lunch.

119
00:18:33,459 --> 00:18:35,569
Need some help?

120
00:18:35,665 --> 00:18:38,734
No, it's OK. I got it.
Thanks, anyhow.

121
00:19:16,808 --> 00:19:18,726
OK, let's settle down.

122
00:19:18,822 --> 00:19:21,507
Welcome
to our Counsellor Training Centre.

123
00:19:21,603 --> 00:19:24,768
You've all worked as counsellors
at one camp or another.

124
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,453
Terry, Vickie,
you were upstate last summer.

125
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:30,810
Scott! Good to see you here.
You need it.

126
00:19:31,865 --> 00:19:34,646
Mark, we worked
a season or two together, right?

127
00:19:35,222 --> 00:19:38,195
OK. The rest of you
I'll get to know soon.

128
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,688
There's one thing
I don't have to tell you.

129
00:19:40,784 --> 00:19:44,045
Being a counsellor isn't
the gravy job everybody thinks it is.

130
00:20:04,185 --> 00:20:06,486
What we'll do
over the next two weeks,

131
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:10,802
if the rest of my staff shows up,
is go back to basics.

132
00:20:11,186 --> 00:20:16,460
Survival, first aid, boating,
archery, rifle range, all of it.

133
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:20,776
What the hell...?

134
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,120
I'll be right back.

135
00:20:31,517 --> 00:20:33,723
Hi! I'm late.

136
00:20:51,657 --> 00:20:54,151
What is this crap, Ginny?
You're my assistant.

137
00:20:54,246 --> 00:20:57,603
- Everyone else got here hours ago.
- I said I was sorry.

138
00:20:57,699 --> 00:20:59,234
You did?

139
00:21:00,576 --> 00:21:02,878
I'm sorry. OK?

140
00:21:02,974 --> 00:21:05,467
- My car's sick.
- You could have called.

141
00:21:05,563 --> 00:21:08,920
Paul, I tried,
but your phones aren't working yet.

142
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:14,290
OK, get your gear stowed
and help me outside.

143
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:18,127
Paul, look,
the course starts today, right?

144
00:21:18,127 --> 00:21:20,045
Well, here I am.

145
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:23,497
And I promise you,
I'll never ever be late again

146
00:21:23,593 --> 00:21:27,142
in my entire life. Is it a deal?

147
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:30,786
Alright. What the hell!

148
00:21:34,047 --> 00:21:36,540
Ginny,
I was starting to worry about you.

149
00:21:38,362 --> 00:21:39,321
Bullshit, Paul.

150
00:21:56,392 --> 00:21:59,078
Ginny, put your car on the lot, OK?

151
00:21:59,174 --> 00:22:02,914
This place is starting to look like
a Burger King. Where was I?

152
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:06,750
"You were about to give your ""Let's
keep our shit together"" speech."

153
00:22:06,846 --> 00:22:08,572
Mr Holt.

154
00:22:08,572 --> 00:22:10,490
Right, Ted. Right.

155
00:22:10,586 --> 00:22:12,600
OK, a few words about safety.

156
00:22:12,696 --> 00:22:16,436
Axes, knives, lanterns, saws.
They can all be trouble.

157
00:22:16,532 --> 00:22:19,409
Their misuse
is the main cause of camp accidents.

158
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:22,286
Take care of your equipment
and it'll take care of you.

159
00:22:23,629 --> 00:22:26,986
A word of caution
about our friends in the forest.

160
00:22:27,082 --> 00:22:29,479
Among other things,
this is bear country.

161
00:22:29,575 --> 00:22:32,548
Contrary to what everyone hears,
bears are dangerous.

162
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:35,425
That means no food fights.

163
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:38,782
Change often.
Food odours cling to clothing.

164
00:22:39,165 --> 00:22:41,755
If you're a woman, don't use perfume.

165
00:22:41,851 --> 00:22:44,057
Keep clean
during your menstrual cycle.

166
00:22:49,044 --> 00:22:52,976
Having trouble? You got to
treat 'em gentle. Just like kids.

167
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:55,757
Use that child psychology
you're majoring in.

168
00:22:59,785 --> 00:23:01,223
Try it.

169
00:23:12,156 --> 00:23:15,225
It's more fun
using that child psychology on you.

170
00:23:15,321 --> 00:23:18,007
You're such a sucker for it.

171
00:23:21,076 --> 00:23:23,569
I don't want to scare anyone.

172
00:23:24,816 --> 00:23:27,981
But I'm gonna give it to you straight
about Jason.

173
00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:33,064
His body was never recovered
from the lake after he drowned.

174
00:23:35,269 --> 00:23:38,530
The old-timers in town
will tell you he's still out there,

175
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:43,517
some sort of demented creature,
surviving in the wilderness.

176
00:23:43,517 --> 00:23:45,052
Full grown by now.

177
00:23:46,394 --> 00:23:47,929
Stalking...

178
00:23:48,984 --> 00:23:53,107
...stealing what he needs, living off
wild animals and vegetation.

179
00:23:55,313 --> 00:23:59,437
Some folks claim
they've seen him, right in this area.

180
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:05,767
The girl who survived that night at
Camp Blood, that Friday the 13th...

181
00:24:07,014 --> 00:24:08,932
...she claims she saw him.

182
00:24:10,562 --> 00:24:12,864
She disappeared two months later.

183
00:24:14,206 --> 00:24:15,741
Vanished.

184
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:19,002
Blood was everywhere.

185
00:24:20,824 --> 00:24:23,030
No-one knows what happened to her.

186
00:24:26,578 --> 00:24:30,990
Legend has it that Jason saw
his mother beheaded that night,

187
00:24:31,085 --> 00:24:33,195
and he took his revenge.

188
00:24:34,442 --> 00:24:39,141
A revenge he'll continue to seek if
anyone enters his wilderness again.

189
00:24:43,361 --> 00:24:47,773
By now, I guess you all know
we're the first to return here.

190
00:24:50,938 --> 00:24:55,541
Five years...
five long years he's been dormant.

191
00:24:57,459 --> 00:24:59,665
And he's hungry.

192
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,350
Jason's out there...

193
00:25:04,172 --> 00:25:05,899
...watching.

194
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:10,310
Always on the prowl for intruders.

195
00:25:10,406 --> 00:25:13,091
Waiting to kill.

196
00:25:13,187 --> 00:25:15,105
Waiting to devour.

197
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:19,037
Thirsty for young blood.

198
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,806
Hey, come back!

199
00:25:31,793 --> 00:25:34,382
Now we've got that out of our system,

200
00:25:34,478 --> 00:25:36,684
I don't want to hear
any more about it.

201
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:40,424
It's ancient history. Jason drowned,
Mrs Voorhees was killed,

202
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,493
and Camp Crystal Lake is off limits.
You got it?

203
00:25:43,589 --> 00:25:46,946
Got you, huh? What d'you think?

204
00:25:47,809 --> 00:25:50,206
The second act needs work.

205
00:26:02,578 --> 00:26:04,592
- Too bad.
- C'mon.

206
00:26:06,989 --> 00:26:09,291
You got him. You got him now.

207
00:26:10,922 --> 00:26:12,744
Go on.

208
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:17,539
- That's luck, right?
- Thanks a lot.

209
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,032
Next.

210
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:24,923
- Hi, Terry. Do you wanna dance?
- No, thank you.

211
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:28,280
Hi. How about you?
Do you wanna dance?

212
00:26:35,473 --> 00:26:41,131
So there I was, sitting in this
fast-food joint, thinking to myself,

213
00:26:41,227 --> 00:26:46,022
Scott, old boy, what are you going
to do with the rest of your life?

214
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,572
I'm striking out all over the place.

215
00:26:57,147 --> 00:26:59,928
Well, I think I've got you. Check.

216
00:27:01,367 --> 00:27:03,189
Wrong, white man.

217
00:27:04,148 --> 00:27:06,162
Checkmate.

218
00:27:08,368 --> 00:27:09,807
Well, what next?

219
00:27:10,574 --> 00:27:12,875
I could get my arm broken by Mark,

220
00:27:12,971 --> 00:27:16,232
my brains
ponged by our electronical wizard...

221
00:27:17,575 --> 00:27:19,397
...or bed.

222
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,617
Good night, Paul.
See you in the morning.

223
00:27:47,593 --> 00:27:49,703
I just gotta see that place.

224
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:52,772
- What place?
- That camp. Camp Blood.

225
00:27:52,867 --> 00:27:53,922
You're crazy.

226
00:27:54,018 --> 00:27:56,991
Maybe there is something
in that legend.

227
00:27:57,087 --> 00:28:00,540
- I'm serious.
- No way. I'm not going there.

228
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:04,088
- Besides, Paul said it's off limits.
- We'll see.

229
00:28:58,754 --> 00:29:00,192
Hello?

230
00:29:02,973 --> 00:29:04,508
Who's there?

231
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:18,030
- Paul, goddamn it!
- Hey, calm down.

232
00:29:18,126 --> 00:29:19,948
You'll wake the natives.

233
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,689
I'm not supposed to be
fraternising with the staff.

234
00:29:28,963 --> 00:29:30,498
I won't tell.

235
00:29:45,746 --> 00:29:47,377
I missed you, Ginny.

236
00:29:48,336 --> 00:29:51,309
I was worried
when you didn't show on time.

237
00:30:11,832 --> 00:30:16,148
Paul, there's something
I think I should tell you.

238
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:54,797
BEWARE OF BEARS

239
00:31:01,798 --> 00:31:03,525
Hey, come on!

240
00:31:03,621 --> 00:31:07,361
What's the matter, guys?
Jeff, the women are showing you up.

241
00:31:27,213 --> 00:31:31,337
We've got about half a mile,
then we'll have lunch.

242
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:35,173
Try to stay on this trail,
because there's poison ivy here.

243
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:39,105
- How far are we from camp?
- You're gonna trip on that.

244
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:52,436
After lunch
we're gonna do some more running.

245
00:32:33,578 --> 00:32:36,551
- Here you go, Ted.
- Thank you, dear.

246
00:32:41,155 --> 00:32:43,648
- Come and get 'em!
- I'm here.

247
00:32:49,786 --> 00:32:52,567
Muffin? Here, girl.

248
00:32:59,568 --> 00:33:01,007
Terry, lunch.

249
00:33:01,007 --> 00:33:02,829
OK. I'm coming.

250
00:33:32,847 --> 00:33:35,053
Jeff, are you ready?

251
00:33:35,149 --> 00:33:38,122
- For what?
- Camp Blood.

252
00:33:38,122 --> 00:33:42,725
- We're not supposed to go there.
- They'll never know we're gone.

253
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:45,794
Jeff, I'm serious.
I really wanna see it.

254
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:49,726
When we get back to the city,
we can tell everyone we were there.

255
00:33:49,822 --> 00:33:52,124
Oh, come on, you chickenshit.

256
00:34:05,742 --> 00:34:07,564
OK, let's go.

257
00:34:36,048 --> 00:34:39,117
OK, you guys. I got one. Ready?

258
00:34:39,213 --> 00:34:42,473
What's green and red,
and moves at 100 miles an hour?

259
00:34:42,569 --> 00:34:44,679
- What?
- A frog in a blender.

260
00:34:44,775 --> 00:34:46,789
Ha-ha. That wasn't funny.

261
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:51,201
- What's brown and sits on a piano?
- Your face.

262
00:34:51,201 --> 00:34:53,311
Beethoven's last movement.

263
00:34:53,406 --> 00:34:54,749
God!

264
00:35:30,234 --> 00:35:33,590
This must be it.

265
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,254
- Oh, my God!
- What is it?

266
00:36:14,349 --> 00:36:16,172
Looks like a dog.

267
00:36:17,035 --> 00:36:20,391
- It's too mangled to tell.
- What did it?

268
00:36:20,487 --> 00:36:22,693
Wild animal, I guess.

269
00:36:24,323 --> 00:36:26,529
What are you kids doing out here?

270
00:36:30,749 --> 00:36:34,585
Keep your people away from
that place, Holt. It's condemned.

271
00:36:35,352 --> 00:36:37,942
Next time I catch anybody,
I'll run 'em in.

272
00:36:38,038 --> 00:36:40,435
- He said...
- I'll handle this.

273
00:36:42,162 --> 00:36:44,943
- Might get a warrant against you.
- Really?

274
00:36:48,779 --> 00:36:53,670
Look, Holt... people say what you're
doing with these kids is great.

275
00:36:53,766 --> 00:36:55,780
You've got a good reputation.

276
00:36:55,876 --> 00:36:59,137
But if I was you,
I'd have located in the next county.

277
00:36:59,233 --> 00:37:00,959
You're too close.

278
00:37:01,055 --> 00:37:03,836
It's been quiet for five years.
That's how we want it.

279
00:37:03,932 --> 00:37:06,905
So do I, Officer.

280
00:37:07,001 --> 00:37:09,878
You two, take off.
We'll talk at dinner.

281
00:37:09,878 --> 00:37:13,426
- We'll never do it again, sir.
- Thanks, Mr Holt.

282
00:37:15,728 --> 00:37:18,222
You're not even
going to reprimand them?

283
00:37:18,317 --> 00:37:21,003
No punishment?
What kind of place is this?

284
00:37:21,099 --> 00:37:22,633
- Ginny?
- Yes, Paul?

285
00:37:22,729 --> 00:37:25,798
No seconds on dessert
for Jeff and Sandra tonight.

286
00:37:30,401 --> 00:37:32,032
You OK?

287
00:37:33,374 --> 00:37:36,347
Shall we tell Terry
about what we saw?

288
00:37:36,347 --> 00:37:40,279
No way. As far as I'm concerned,
we didn't see a thing.

289
00:38:04,351 --> 00:38:06,557
Hey, you!

290
00:40:51,512 --> 00:40:54,581
Oh, my God!

291
00:41:01,774 --> 00:41:03,692
Who made this shit?

292
00:41:05,322 --> 00:41:06,761
OK, people.

293
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,022
Today was fun and games.

294
00:41:10,117 --> 00:41:14,529
I like to start you out slow.
Tomorrow, we'll get serious.

295
00:41:14,625 --> 00:41:19,036
Anybody wants a last night
on the town, now's your chance.

296
00:41:19,132 --> 00:41:21,434
Who else? We only have two cars.

297
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:24,503
Our wanderers
have volunteered to watch the camp.

298
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:26,421
Isn't that nice of them?

299
00:41:27,092 --> 00:41:29,394
I'll stay, too. Muffin may show.

300
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:31,888
Well, I'm gonna go change.

301
00:41:32,463 --> 00:41:36,107
I'm pretty tired.
I think I'll stick around, too.

302
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:40,519
- Would you get me a coffee?
- Don't drink too much.

303
00:41:42,053 --> 00:41:43,492
Hey, you staying?

304
00:41:43,588 --> 00:41:47,328
Yeah. Nothing spoils a party
like a drunk in a wheelchair.

305
00:41:47,424 --> 00:41:50,589
That's crap.
We can go together if you want.

306
00:41:50,685 --> 00:41:54,041
I appreciate that,
but I'm in... training.

307
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:56,823
- Then I'm staying, too.
- Suit yourself.

308
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:01,618
- How about it? You coming?
- You buying?

309
00:42:01,714 --> 00:42:03,728
- Sure.
- You got a deal.

310
00:42:03,824 --> 00:42:05,262
Can I have the keys?

311
00:42:08,619 --> 00:42:10,537
Beer time!

312
00:42:10,633 --> 00:42:14,085
Take it easy. Have fun.
I'll have a Jack for you.

313
00:42:14,181 --> 00:42:17,922
- See you later.
- Bring back my truck in one piece.

314
00:42:18,017 --> 00:42:21,374
- I'm going for a walk.
- We'll wait up for you.

315
00:42:29,142 --> 00:42:30,964
Go, Scooter.

316
00:42:53,022 --> 00:42:55,516
Now I know
how you afford grad school.

317
00:42:55,612 --> 00:42:59,832
You always find some fool
to fix your car and buy you a beer.

318
00:42:59,927 --> 00:43:01,654
You got it.

319
00:43:31,959 --> 00:43:33,494
Muffin?

320
00:43:38,769 --> 00:43:40,687
- Here we are!
- Alright.

321
00:43:49,989 --> 00:43:52,675
Everybody, get some beers! Alright!

322
00:44:45,326 --> 00:44:47,052
C'mon, Mark.

323
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,588
You're gonna lose. Alright.

324
00:44:56,355 --> 00:44:59,424
Cheater.
OK. Two out of three.

325
00:45:02,301 --> 00:45:05,370
Jeff... don't wear yourself out.

326
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:07,863
You wanna wrestle, come with me.

327
00:45:09,302 --> 00:45:10,741
Later, Scooter.

328
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:13,330
Wanna take me on?

329
00:45:13,426 --> 00:45:15,248
Sure. Have a seat.

330
00:45:20,523 --> 00:45:23,783
- I only want your fingers.
- What?

331
00:45:24,551 --> 00:45:25,893
Take your pick.

332
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:28,675
They're Ted's. It's OK with him.

333
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:31,648
Football and hockey.

334
00:45:31,744 --> 00:45:33,278
Which one do you prefer?

335
00:45:33,374 --> 00:45:35,196
The one with the puck.

336
00:45:36,251 --> 00:45:39,704
- You mean hockey?
- Is that what you call it?

337
00:45:39,799 --> 00:45:42,485
OK. What d'you wanna play for?

338
00:45:43,156 --> 00:45:44,786
Position.

339
00:46:30,916 --> 00:46:33,026
Looking for something?

340
00:46:44,247 --> 00:46:47,987
- Come and get it.
- Give me my shirt, Scott.

341
00:46:50,289 --> 00:46:52,303
If I get my hands on you...!

342
00:46:52,399 --> 00:46:54,221
Scott!

343
00:46:57,290 --> 00:46:59,879
It's no longer funny, Scott.

344
00:47:01,414 --> 00:47:05,442
Help! Goddamn that Paul.
Him and his wilderness bullshit.

345
00:47:05,538 --> 00:47:08,511
- What can I do?
- Get me down.

346
00:47:08,607 --> 00:47:12,443
- I'll have to get a knife.
- Well, hurry, OK?

347
00:47:16,087 --> 00:47:18,389
I ought to let you hang, you pervert.

348
00:47:18,485 --> 00:47:21,074
C'mon, Ter. Give me a break.

349
00:47:21,074 --> 00:47:24,910
- You gonna cut the crap?
- Anything. I promise.

350
00:47:25,006 --> 00:47:26,637
OK.

351
00:47:28,363 --> 00:47:30,089
Don't go anywhere.

352
00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:34,597
Very funny!

353
00:48:24,467 --> 00:48:25,905
Where is she?

354
00:49:01,102 --> 00:49:03,116
Scott, I'm gonna cut you down.

355
00:49:03,116 --> 00:49:07,240
But if you ever do this to me again,
I'm gonna kill you.

356
00:49:08,295 --> 00:49:09,733
Scott?

357
00:49:55,288 --> 00:49:56,726
Look at this.

358
00:49:57,589 --> 00:49:59,699
I think I'm in love.

359
00:49:59,795 --> 00:50:02,097
No, it's just tremendous affection.

360
00:50:04,015 --> 00:50:06,988
Are you sure
you don't want me to clear those?

361
00:50:06,988 --> 00:50:08,427
No, I'm collecting these.

362
00:50:08,522 --> 00:50:12,263
Have it your way. I just don't want
the bar to fall down on you.

363
00:50:12,359 --> 00:50:13,701
Thanks.

364
00:50:14,756 --> 00:50:17,537
- I think she likes you.
- I think so, too.

365
00:50:19,551 --> 00:50:21,470
This whole thing's ridiculous.

366
00:50:21,565 --> 00:50:25,306
Two of our kids got hauled in today
because five years ago,

367
00:50:25,402 --> 00:50:29,334
some girl panics and falls out
of a canoe. It's absurd.

368
00:50:30,484 --> 00:50:33,745
- What if there is a Jason?
- Bullshit, Ginny.

369
00:50:33,841 --> 00:50:37,965
No, what if there is a boy-beast
running around Camp Crystal Lake?

370
00:50:38,061 --> 00:50:41,705
Try to think beyond the legend.
Put it in real terms.

371
00:50:41,801 --> 00:50:43,623
What would he be like today?

372
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:46,500
Some kind of
out-of-control psychopath?

373
00:50:46,596 --> 00:50:50,337
A frightened retard?
A child trapped in a man's body?

374
00:50:50,433 --> 00:50:51,871
Let me out!

375
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:58,488
- He'd be grown by now, right?
- Right.

376
00:50:58,584 --> 00:51:02,133
The only person
that ever knew him was his mother.

377
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:05,010
He never went to school,
so he had no friends.

378
00:51:05,106 --> 00:51:06,736
She was everything to him.

379
00:51:06,832 --> 00:51:09,038
Yeah. Deranged killer.

380
00:51:11,531 --> 00:51:14,696
No. You're missing my whole point.

381
00:51:14,792 --> 00:51:18,149
I doubt Jason would have even known
the meaning of death.

382
00:51:18,245 --> 00:51:20,450
At least until that horrible night.

383
00:51:20,546 --> 00:51:23,423
He must've seen
the whole thing happen.

384
00:51:23,615 --> 00:51:27,643
He must've seen his mother get
killed, all because she loved him.

385
00:51:27,739 --> 00:51:30,233
Isn't that what her revenge
was all about?

386
00:51:30,329 --> 00:51:34,452
Her sense of loss, her rage
at what she thought happened,

387
00:51:34,548 --> 00:51:36,466
her love for him?

388
00:51:39,919 --> 00:51:41,262
Bizarre, isn't it?

389
00:51:43,947 --> 00:51:48,838
He must be out there now, crying
for her return, her resurrection.

390
00:51:50,756 --> 00:51:53,250
- What d'you think?
- I think you're drunk.

391
00:51:53,346 --> 00:51:57,182
I'll drink to that.
Hit us again, sweetheart.

392
00:51:57,278 --> 00:51:58,908
Not me.

393
00:52:03,128 --> 00:52:06,580
Paul, I'm really serious
about this stuff.

394
00:52:06,676 --> 00:52:08,882
Jason's a legend, Ginny.

395
00:52:57,697 --> 00:53:00,862
Your turn. Three goals,
or you're gonna lose.

396
00:53:00,862 --> 00:53:03,068
I've heard that one before.

397
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:08,726
Mark, what happened
that you have to be in a chair?

398
00:53:08,822 --> 00:53:11,891
Motorcycle accident
paralysed my legs.

399
00:53:11,987 --> 00:53:13,617
Is it permanent?

400
00:53:14,576 --> 00:53:17,741
The doctor thinks so. I don't.

401
00:53:17,837 --> 00:53:21,673
I don't intend to be in this thing
the rest of my life.

402
00:53:21,769 --> 00:53:24,934
Just your legs, huh?
Is everything else OK?

403
00:53:26,468 --> 00:53:29,633
Oh, I do alright, one way or another.

404
00:53:33,661 --> 00:53:35,291
Toke?

405
00:53:35,387 --> 00:53:37,977
I'm in training, remember?

406
00:53:38,073 --> 00:53:39,799
For what?

407
00:54:25,066 --> 00:54:27,847
What does the winner get?

408
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:30,916
- What does the winner want?
- Guess.

409
00:54:38,109 --> 00:54:40,218
Want to stay together tonight?

410
00:54:40,314 --> 00:54:42,328
I was just about to ask you.

411
00:54:42,424 --> 00:54:44,534
My cabin or yours?

412
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:48,083
Ted's in mine.
I don't think that would work out.

413
00:54:48,179 --> 00:54:51,535
We've got the whole camp.
We'll find our own cabin.

414
00:54:51,631 --> 00:54:54,029
Just let me get some things, OK?

415
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:56,810
- Sure.
- I'll be right back.

416
00:55:07,168 --> 00:55:08,318
Oh, damn it.

417
00:55:12,538 --> 00:55:14,073
Terry, you turkey.

418
00:57:18,556 --> 00:57:20,282
There you are.

419
00:57:41,477 --> 00:57:42,916
Vickie?

420
00:57:48,766 --> 00:57:51,163
Vickie, is that you?

421
00:58:13,413 --> 00:58:14,372
Vickie?

422
01:00:18,376 --> 01:00:19,335
- I gotta sleep.
- I'm tired.

423
01:00:20,582 --> 01:00:24,226
- You quitting already?
- You'd have me out till breakfast.

424
01:00:24,322 --> 01:00:27,966
- I'll ride with you, OK? Night, Ted.
- Night, Ginny.

425
01:00:28,062 --> 01:00:31,035
When this place closes,
come straight back to camp.

426
01:00:31,131 --> 01:00:34,008
- Yes, boss.
- And let Maggie drive.

427
01:00:34,104 --> 01:00:36,406
Yes, boss.

428
01:00:36,502 --> 01:00:38,228
OK, let's make a run for it.

429
01:00:41,777 --> 01:00:44,078
- Move it!
- I'm going!

430
01:00:53,189 --> 01:00:55,587
This thing'd better start.

431
01:00:55,779 --> 01:00:58,560
- You fixed it.
- That's what worries me.

432
01:01:07,479 --> 01:01:10,068
Are there any after-hours places
around here?

433
01:01:10,164 --> 01:01:12,082
Sure are.

434
01:01:12,466 --> 01:01:14,096
Sure are.

435
01:01:22,536 --> 01:01:24,454
Mark?

436
01:01:36,538 --> 01:01:38,648
Mark, where are you?

437
01:01:49,677 --> 01:01:51,786
Is anybody still here?

438
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:57,924
Sandra?

439
01:01:57,924 --> 01:01:59,938
Jeff?

440
01:02:24,298 --> 01:02:26,600
No!

441
01:02:37,533 --> 01:02:39,547
No!

442
01:03:18,771 --> 01:03:20,114
Nice night!

443
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:22,224
Yeah, for a duck.

444
01:03:38,719 --> 01:03:40,350
God.

445
01:03:41,405 --> 01:03:43,898
What the hell
are all the lights on for?

446
01:03:43,994 --> 01:03:47,063
They wouldn't have
left the place like this.

447
01:03:50,516 --> 01:03:52,434
Think something's wrong?

448
01:03:54,256 --> 01:03:56,078
I'll check upstairs.

449
01:04:00,298 --> 01:04:02,983
These kids
smoke better dope than I do.

450
01:04:03,079 --> 01:04:04,518
Paul!

451
01:04:06,723 --> 01:04:08,737
Yeah, Ginny, what?

452
01:04:11,423 --> 01:04:13,053
What is this, a joke?

453
01:04:13,149 --> 01:04:16,026
They wouldn't do anything like this.

454
01:04:19,862 --> 01:04:21,301
Ginny, c'mon.

455
01:04:22,452 --> 01:04:24,082
Wait for me.

456
01:04:28,302 --> 01:04:32,042
Kitchen light's still on.
Must be the main fuse again.

457
01:04:32,138 --> 01:04:34,536
- Paul, what's going on here?
- Nothing.

458
01:04:39,043 --> 01:04:40,673
Where is everybody?

459
01:04:40,769 --> 01:04:42,496
I don't know.

460
01:04:44,030 --> 01:04:46,715
The rain's stopping.
We'll go look for 'em.

461
01:05:01,868 --> 01:05:04,266
Paul, there's someone in this room.

462
01:05:08,102 --> 01:05:10,500
There's someone in this fucking room!

463
01:05:15,103 --> 01:05:17,788
Oh, my God!

464
01:05:17,884 --> 01:05:19,802
Paul?

465
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:37,065
Answer me!

466
01:07:31,862 --> 01:07:34,260
Keys.

467
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,438
Come on!

468
01:07:41,261 --> 01:07:43,466
Please start.

469
01:07:45,672 --> 01:07:47,782
Oh, shit!

470
01:08:01,113 --> 01:08:02,647
Oh, my God!

471
01:13:18,843 --> 01:13:20,377
Oh, my God!

472
01:13:20,473 --> 01:13:22,295
Please help me.

473
01:13:27,282 --> 01:13:28,625
Oh, God...

474
01:14:38,059 --> 01:14:40,553
Jason! It's all done, Jason.

475
01:14:42,567 --> 01:14:45,156
You've done yourjob well,
and Mommy is pleased.

476
01:14:46,019 --> 01:14:47,458
That's a good boy.

477
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:52,445
Now, come to Mommy. Come on.

478
01:14:55,034 --> 01:14:56,281
Come on.

479
01:14:59,254 --> 01:15:02,131
Mommy has a reward for you.

480
01:15:10,571 --> 01:15:12,969
Jason, Mother is talking to you.

481
01:15:15,462 --> 01:15:18,819
Jason, Mother is talking to you.

482
01:15:20,641 --> 01:15:22,079
