1
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,045
Grab him!

2
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:10,087
Come on kid. Out you come.

3
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,887
It's nothing, we're just
training with your dad.

4
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,180
Come on, we're waiting for you.

5
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:29,946
Sir... Don't hurt me!

6
00:02:29,947 --> 00:02:33,946
Shut up and quit struggling.
Lam not going to do anything.

7
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:38,834
NO! NO! Please, don't kill me!

8
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:53,415
Alright. Good boy. Everything
is going to be Okay.

9
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:44,771
The bullet is lodged
behind the frontal lobe.

10
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:49,353
It's impossible to remove it
without damaging the rest of the brain.

11
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,354
In any case his chances
of survival are very little.

12
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,447
He won't survive more than 48 hours.

13
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,610
There's no point in cutting.
Let nature take its course.

14
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:56,485
It's a miracle he has survived this far.

15
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,737
One of the cops told me
that the shell misfired.

16
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:58,908
Otherwise the bullet
would have blown his brains out.

17
00:03:58,909 --> 00:03:59,870
Has his family been notified? No one left.

18
00:03:59,871 --> 00:04:02,038
His parents were killed, but he'll
be able to be with them very soon...

19
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:04,034
which is probably the best thing.

20
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,911
Hey! Have you seen that new nurse? Hot!

21
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,585
$500 I get her before you do!

22
00:04:07,586 --> 00:04:09,003
You're on.

23
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:22,421
Don't worry. I'm here. Hang in there.
You need to fight... fight...

24
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:28,058
Superintendent!
Do you have any leads on the killers?

25
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,232
The inquiry is in hand.

26
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,940
What exactly were they working on?

27
00:04:31,941 --> 00:04:32,938
That's classified.

28
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,565
Superintendent, superintendent...

29
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,532
Do you have any leads on the murder
of Inspector Samat and his family?

30
00:04:36,533 --> 00:04:38,694
What a pain in my ass. What's
the news on Samat's kid?

31
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,529
He's still in a coma.

32
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,373
Make sure he's not left alone.

33
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:43,746
Understood.

34
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,493
Go ahead.

35
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:05,605
You can't come in here. This
is the intensive care unit.

36
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:12,696
His parents didn't want him on life
support. You have to turn it off.

37
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,986
Are you sure this is official?

38
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,993
Don't I look like I'm official?

39
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,161
Hold on! Give the kid a break!

40
00:05:24,162 --> 00:05:29,411
Science has made so much progress
and miracles do happen. Tell him, Doctor.

41
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,790
If you turn it off, will he live?

42
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,549
No way.

43
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,382
Right. Then go ahead.
I'll take responsibility.

44
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,426
You can't do this. You'll kill him!
It's murder.

45
00:05:38,427 --> 00:05:40,673
Turn it off. That's an order.

46
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,723
It's murder, no!

47
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,681
Don't touch me!

48
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:08,994
What does that mean?

49
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,036
I told you!

50
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,540
He's alive. It's incredible!

51
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:24,226
There's a problem.

52
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,938
Nurse.

53
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:37,273
Here's my card, call me if you have
any news about the boy.

54
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:46,533
Yes, it's bad news. Yes, exactly.

55
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:19,357
Don't worry little one. I'm here.

56
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:27,095
Hello. What the hell has happened?

57
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:31,054
Where's the kid? You are a bunch
of incompetent idiots!

58
00:08:31,055 --> 00:08:32,474
Why didn't you warn me?

59
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,194
Adjan.

60
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,838
It's very bad isn't it?

61
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:05,342
His spirit is with us,
but he is between two worlds.

62
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:16,140
So that's it?

63
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,520
Don't you think I'm a bit
old to be playing nurse?

64
00:09:18,521 --> 00:09:20,684
They're going to kill him.

65
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,564
Judging by his current condition
they wouldn't have to try very hard.

66
00:09:23,565 --> 00:09:26,237
Adjan, be careful! I'm sure he can hear us.

67
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,448
The truth will cure him.

68
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:36,043
You know the secrets of the plants.
Only you can save him.

69
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:43,592
I will never ask anything of you...
if you won't do it for him... do it for me?

70
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,597
Then I get to go on holiday.

71
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,149
Thank you very much!

72
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,703
Long live holiday.

73
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,332
Know your past to build your future.

74
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,218
Know your body to open your spirit.

75
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,483
Nothing's changed?

76
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:00,080
He's ataraxic, his brain has been damaged.

77
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:07,085
He doesn't feel anything anymore.
No happiness, no pain...

78
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:20,537
You are about as fast as a turtle
and as powerful as a koala.

79
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:35,629
Training is not knowledge
and knowledge is not power.

80
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:40,136
Combine the training with the knowledge
and you shall achieve the power.

81
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,899
My art has become your art.

82
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,746
This evening I shall teach you
the ultimate technique.

83
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:06,166
The way which leads to death. This you
must use only if your life is in danger.

84
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,408
Hey, a beer!

85
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,954
Tea for two.

86
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:40,006
Lesson 956: A good fighter must know
how to receive like a buffalo.

87
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:45,393
Lesson 957: He must dodge like a mongoose.

88
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:50,016
And lesson 958: Strike like a tiger.

89
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:55,070
When you fight, you must neither dodge
nor reply until I tell you.

90
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,188
We will start with lesson 956.

91
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:00,692
Ok, who will I fight?

92
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:08,867
Adjan, they haven't done anything to me.

93
00:15:08,868 --> 00:15:09,833
They will.

94
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:17,126
What? What did you say?
That they are all sons of bitches?

95
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,718
Lesson 956.

96
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,345
What did you say?

97
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,358
Think about the buffalo.

98
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,858
<i>And lesson 957.</i>

99
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:49,908
Lesson 958.

100
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,518
And our teas?

101
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:20,188
I think I prefer 958.

102
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,123
Master Adjan?

103
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,796
Yes?

104
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:41,004
Chanticha is sick. She wants to see Manit.

105
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,352
Hello Mom.

106
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:04,612
Manit, we have to talk

107
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:08,703
lam sick my little one. I will die soon.

108
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:17,737
I know that you understand
but you feel nothing.

109
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:22,087
This is not your fault. I will explain...

110
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:38,851
You have to know that your father
was a distinguished lieutenant.

111
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:47,767
He was investigating a vast network
of corruption within the police force.

112
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:55,824
But he didn't have the
support of his hierarchy.

113
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:59,995
He was starting to disturb
way too many people.

114
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,964
One evening they decided
to get rid of them.

115
00:18:01,965 --> 00:18:05,711
They murdered all of his colleagues.

116
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:11,043
One by one, carefully.
Then they went to your house.

117
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,243
Who did this?

118
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:44,169
The investigation never found
the people responsible,

119
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:54,125
but for all these years
I have continued to search. Look in there.

120
00:18:55,176 --> 00:19:00,603
Everything I have discovered is in there.

121
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:09,932
Press articles, pictures, witnesses...
I did what I could to <i>save</i> you.

122
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:17,828
I can no longer protect you...
lam so tired Manit.

123
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,914
Don't worry mother, I am ready.

124
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:29,211
Hello. I work as a nurse
at the General Hospital.

125
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:31,220
You asked me to inform you
if I ever hear of any information

126
00:19:31,221 --> 00:19:34,307
about the little boy who
disappeared years ago.

127
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:40,897
Do you remember? Well I know where he is.

128
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:53,242
Do you know him?

129
00:19:55,338 --> 00:19:56,578
No, I've never seen him before.

130
00:19:56,579 --> 00:19:59,494
He doesn't look very sad.

131
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,218
Do you think it's him?

132
00:20:17,219 --> 00:20:18,593
How the hell would I know?

133
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:21,061
The only photo I've seen
was when he was a kid.

134
00:20:21,062 --> 00:20:22,680
Call the boss!

135
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:34,151
Sir... it's me. Yes...
he just walked past the car.

136
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:38,037
Yeah... just like that. I can't say really.

137
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:43,702
Looks like a peasant. Okay.
We will see if we can.

138
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,494
And?

139
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:51,922
We have to check
if he has a scar on his left temple.

140
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:54,252
If so, we take him to the boss.

141
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,551
Okay, let's go.

142
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:53,480
Where is he?

143
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:38,894
Hey, come here... Did you see this guy?
Sure? I'll be back.

144
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:09,512
Well, we had a deal. You
promised me an interview.

145
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:13,313
Yeah... we promised you an interview...
we keep our words right?

146
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:17,148
But it's just that we need to drag
it out a little bit... you know,

147
00:23:17,149 --> 00:23:18,187
it's not that easy.

148
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,063
Okay come on Clara let's split!

149
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,529
Hey, where the fuck you
think you're going man?

150
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:24,115
Take it easy. Okay... how
much more do you want?

151
00:23:24,116 --> 00:23:28,489
All you gotta do is give us a blow job,
for each and every one of us.

152
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,538
We'll tell you the greatest story
you need to know.

153
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:31,535
Yeah...

154
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,077
Sounds good?

155
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:36,457
By the way pretty boy...
we've got something for you too.

156
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:42,217
Stop it! No, no! Stop it!
Stop it! Leave him!

157
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:12,243
What's going on over here?

158
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,248
Who the fuck are you?

159
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:16,004
Manit...

160
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,426
Your friend is a kind of strange...

161
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,256
Who the fuck is this fool man?

162
00:24:23,257 --> 00:24:25,631
Lamon, get this fool man, beat him up!

163
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,911
You wanted to speak with him?

164
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,161
Yeah.

165
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,506
Hey! The girl wants to talk with you.

166
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:01,466
All right...

167
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,603
These young people...
they've got nothing in their lives!

168
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:14,309
Okay-

169
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,023
They must be suffering!

170
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,986
I'm not sure about before,
but definitely now.

171
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,821
How can you do things like
that to human beings?

172
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:30,822
First you have to study anatomy,
then it's just a matter of training.

173
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:36,200
Okay guys, I'm out of here.
Thanks again Manit.

174
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,168
See you tomorrow.

175
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:39,129
Yeah, Okay. See you.

176
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,961
You have somewhere to sleep?

177
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:47,883
No.

178
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:54,433
You could crash at my place
if you like. I've got a couch.

179
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,019
- Which way?
- This way!

180
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,856
You don't know me!

181
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,573
My instinct never fails me.

182
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:10,779
Right... Sometimes people
are who they seem to be.

183
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:14,373
How come that you speak English so well?

184
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,122
If I told you, you'd never believe me...

185
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,258
Shower's through there.

186
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,896
It's a nice place.

187
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:50,734
Interesting?

188
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,736
I'm a journalist...

189
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,114
So you are honest?

190
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,580
Do you have an explanation for these?

191
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:03,334
I would have taken their ears...
but I didn't have a knife.

192
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:08,090
They were following me...
I didn't know they were cops.

193
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:20,930
Hey! Hey! Girls, where are you going?

194
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:24,151
Come here! Come here! Do you know this guy?

195
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,276
Never seen him!

196
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:06,401
You snore quite loud for a girl!

197
00:28:06,402 --> 00:28:08,236
I didn't snore!

198
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:09,525
You have a dog?

199
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,152
I don't have a dog!

200
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:14,451
Well then I guess you snore.

201
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,112
Cheeky!

202
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,654
Sneaky?

203
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:23,830
No... Okay forget it! Actually I've been
looking through your friend's file...

204
00:28:23,831 --> 00:28:25,203
Those are my mother's files.

205
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,377
Mother? Okay whatever.

206
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:32,255
Your mother she did a very good detective job
but there are more questions than answers.

207
00:28:32,256 --> 00:28:35,096
Well that's why I'm here.
I'm trying to find all the answers.

208
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,220
I can help you.

209
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,960
We found him. He's with a journalist
who investigates gangs.

210
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:53,115
Well... I think we'll have to intervene...

211
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,132
How was I?

212
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:21,264
Marvelous as ever my beauty.

213
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:24,887
The first show is in 10
days I'm so nervous!

214
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,435
Because you are talented!

215
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:30,354
You're so nice
and I want to say again how grateful

216
00:29:30,355 --> 00:29:32,773
I am that you are producing this concert.

217
00:29:32,774 --> 00:29:34,739
I'm retired, I have got a wife

218
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,076
who sings like an angel
and I have the means.

219
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:43,248
Is it true? You don't feel any emotions?

220
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,326
Sometimes I get a bit hungry...

221
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:51,799
Smart ass... I read the medical report.

222
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:59,011
Oh yeah? Sometimes I think it might be
something of an advantage. You know?

223
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:02,309
It's a short cut.

224
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,069
Short cut, huh?

225
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:20,526
Police... come with us.

226
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,153
I'm not moving an inch.

227
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:26,534
I'm a journalist and this is an
illegal arrest. I know my rights.

228
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:32,256
Let go of me! Let go! Manit!

229
00:31:23,552 --> 00:31:24,673
Where did you take the girl?

230
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:25,341
Fuck you.

231
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:26,844
That's not very nice.

232
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:30,688
Where?

233
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:34,433
8th district... Special force.

234
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:37,313
Well I'm gonna have to give them
a special visit then. Don't I?

235
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:39,689
Thank you!

236
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:51,804
Missed it...

237
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:55,773
Same floor...

238
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,215
Where is the girl?

239
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:35,101
I like you alright, don't make me hurt you!

240
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,365
Where? Where? Okay open the door!
Open the door! Thank you.

241
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:54,871
Okay open the door! Open the door!

242
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:57,210
Thank you.

243
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,532
Nice pants...

244
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,247
So where is the girl?

245
00:34:38,248 --> 00:34:39,495
Fuck the girl!

246
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:29,838
Whoever you are, help me! Help me!

247
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:39,395
Who are you?

248
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,522
Depends!

249
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:43,725
I'm a cop.

250
00:35:44,236 --> 00:35:45,476
It's not a very good reference.

251
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:48,062
Wait, wait! I'm not like them.

252
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,565
I've been onto these guys for months.

253
00:35:49,566 --> 00:35:51,278
Those guys are working for the mob.

254
00:35:51,279 --> 00:35:54,490
It's a real organization
and I almost had their leader.

255
00:35:54,491 --> 00:35:55,738
I can show them to you.

256
00:35:55,739 --> 00:35:56,612
Go on.

257
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:58,659
My father was onto them 20 years ago.

258
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,955
He had all their files. I can show you...

259
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:12,836
Holy shit! You don't fool around, do you!

260
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,176
Not for the last 20 years.

261
00:36:14,177 --> 00:36:15,297
Never seen that before.

262
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,515
Well, I've never done it before...

263
00:36:16,516 --> 00:36:18,977
Hey, come on, I'll show you the files.

264
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:33,776
He was my father. Butchered like a dog.

265
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:37,157
His throat was cut off
and a bastard cut off his tongue.

266
00:36:37,158 --> 00:36:40,157
He was sent <i>as</i> an undercover
by his section chief

267
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:43,998
and I swear I will continue his fight.

268
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,996
Cool. Can you look up Samat...

269
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:52,343
Samat? Samat.

270
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:58,050
Wait, isn't this your...

271
00:36:58,508 --> 00:36:59,976
Yes my father.

272
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,679
Holy shit! Just imagine:

273
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,352
Your father and mine...
and now me and you...

274
00:37:06,353 --> 00:37:08,308
Look, I've set you free and that's great.

275
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,029
But I have got to finish what I've started.

276
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:13,564
Call some of your friends,
get them to do a clean up over here.

277
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:14,657
I'm gonna go find this girl.

278
00:37:14,658 --> 00:37:16,191
Wait, wait. The girl?

279
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:16,734
Yeah!

280
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:18,699
I heard they were handing
her over to the Hyenas.

281
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,533
It's a girl gang.

282
00:37:19,534 --> 00:37:21,493
The cops let them handle
all their dirty works.

283
00:37:21,494 --> 00:37:22,489
Where I can find them?

284
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,366
I'll show them to you, you will get lost.

285
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:27,667
I found you okay didn't I? Leave it to me.
I can use their methods.

286
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:28,704
Okay-

287
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:29,371
Cool!

288
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,295
Come here I'll show you.

289
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,751
They should be here.

290
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:54,106
Hello guys, what did you get?

291
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,350
Excuse me sir do you know
the Khlong Toei neighborhood?

292
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,864
Excuse me sir do you know
the Khlong Toei neighborhood?

293
00:38:39,865 --> 00:38:40,692
I do... yes.

294
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,093
Could you tell me how to get there?

295
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:46,909
Out of the question...
I don't want your death on my conscience.

296
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:16,439
Come on in, come in! We
have the best boxing!

297
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:17,484
Excuse me...

298
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,490
What do you want?

299
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:21,149
I have a friend...

300
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,367
Your friend is in here?

301
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,156
Yes!

302
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:26,122
I hope it's not the fat guy.

303
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,324
This is for white guys.

304
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,794
You see the fat guy with his gang?
He thinks he's Mike Tyson!

305
00:39:31,795 --> 00:39:34,881
He's here because he hopes
to knock someone out.

306
00:39:34,882 --> 00:39:38,417
Like if he was at Lumpinee Stadium.

307
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:41,879
It's going to cost him some money.

308
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,633
But he is ready to pay the price.

309
00:39:55,184 --> 00:40:01,942
Just as long as he feels strong
and feels like a champion.

310
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:06,361
They all dream of being Thai boxers.

311
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,286
And you find guys ready
to take it, just like that?

312
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,918
Same guy has been around for 4 years...

313
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:24,236
Do you know where the Khlong
Toei neighborhood is?

314
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:31,619
Hey, he wants to go to Khlong Toei.

315
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:34,576
Well... if he wants to get
beaten up, let him go.

316
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,299
You're not from around here.

317
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,629
Neither are you.

318
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:51,178
The way you look,
you'll get the shit kicked out of you.

319
00:41:51,179 --> 00:41:52,802
I'm looking for somebody!

320
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,021
Forget it!

321
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:57,228
Like you do with alcohol?

322
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,824
You really want to go there?

323
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:10,828
Yeah! You really want to quit drinking?

324
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,829
50 bucks and I'll take you.

325
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:16,951
3O

326
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:18,627
40

327
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:20,796
Deal!

328
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,049
You don't say much, huh?

329
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:06,088
No.

330
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:18,722
Carry on for 500 meters
and you'll know you're there.

331
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,395
You owe me 40 bucks.

332
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:45,163
Stop playing around and do your homework!

333
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,212
I don't want to mom!

334
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:54,966
It's amazing.

335
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,609
GO, go: Go'

336
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:16,361
Stop, stop!

337
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:20,333
You want some... Bitch!

338
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,453
It's not very nice.

339
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,126
Let her go!

340
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,584
Come and get her.

341
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:31,001
She's useless.

342
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:31,798
What?

343
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,756
Can I ask you something?

344
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:37,758
What?

345
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:42,480
Asshole.

346
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:18,215
Shit! Hello?

347
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:23,687
I am working.

348
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:25,856
When?

349
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:30,357
Okay... start without me.
I'll be there in a minute.

350
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:33,864
Any problem?

351
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:37,111
Not really... just business...

352
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:41,661
we'll start again in two hours.

353
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:45,911
You heard?

354
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,753
I was on the extension.

355
00:45:47,754 --> 00:45:50,294
You really can't help it, can you?

356
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,293
Professional instincts I guess.

357
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:56,428
Be careful.

358
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,097
Of course...

359
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:35,630
Is she dead?

360
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:38,595
It sounds like you're
talking about a sandwich...

361
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:40,681
You're real funny you!

362
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,139
Don't even think about it.

363
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:48,439
You're checking, I'm checking.

364
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,775
That must hurt... but not enough!

365
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:53,110
- Hi boss!
- Hi boss!

366
00:46:53,111 --> 00:46:55,478
Hi girls. So where are we?

367
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,481
We got both of the little shits.

368
00:46:58,899 --> 00:46:59,991
What the hell?

369
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:05,160
We didn't have any rope...
so we tied him with our panties.

370
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:08,455
That's what I love about you all.

371
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:12,205
You've got the initiative
of real bad bitches.

372
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:15,337
You... back to sleep...

373
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:20,263
Look at his left temple. Is there a scar?

374
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:22,630
Yeah, he's got a scar.

375
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:26,477
He's our man.
Right... enough talk. Kill them both.

376
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,149
Not like that.

377
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:36,321
Too quick and too noisy!

378
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:39,648
Get him!

379
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:23,780
Die bastard!

380
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,657
Let's go!

381
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:35,747
Manit, Manit, Manit!

382
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:38,499
Oh my god...

383
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:43,212
Manit.

384
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,677
You're suffocating me.

385
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,590
Thank God you're alive!

386
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:50,470
Oh I must because I can
feel you suffocating me...

387
00:48:50,471 --> 00:48:53,723
Oh please forgive me for
taking care of you.

388
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:03,901
It's weird. You know, I
think I know their leader.

389
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:09,031
She's called Jessy Yiouchenko,
she's an opera singer.

390
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:12,074
She must have other strings on her bow.

391
00:49:13,576 --> 00:49:15,123
Call the downtown police station

392
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:18,414
and ask to speak to Anada
You can give him my name.

393
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:24,379
Tell him what happened here
and ask him to check out this thing...

394
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:29,507
Now what?

395
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:32,512
Your place is on surveillance.
I carry on and you stay here.

396
00:49:32,513 --> 00:49:35,852
No way! I'm coming with you
and you need my help.

397
00:49:35,853 --> 00:49:37,268
It's out of the question... Okay!

398
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:39,860
I hang around and do nothing without...

399
00:49:39,861 --> 00:49:40,603
Okay-

400
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:41,941
What did you say?

401
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:44,489
Okay, it's cool you can come with me.

402
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:47,901
That's it? Normally a
gentleman would have found

403
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:50,621
a thousand reasons why
I shouldn't put my life at risk.

404
00:49:50,622 --> 00:49:54,789
You just say yes and that's it?

405
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:57,128
I'm gonna take a rest. I
feel a little bit tired.

406
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:01,293
I thought we were going to
finish the investigation.

407
00:50:01,294 --> 00:50:03,133
I feel tired so I am going to have a rest.

408
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,381
I'm not tired.

409
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:09,390
Well you were asleep for
the whole fight so you've had your rest.

410
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:13,009
I was not asleep, I was faking it.

411
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:17,481
And why did you say that
I was used for nothing?

412
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,399
I guess I was faking it...
or something like that...

413
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:27,491
- You coming?
- Yes I'm coming.

414
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,260
What are you doing?

415
00:50:50,261 --> 00:50:53,385
I'm comforting you... I
think you had a nightmare.

416
00:50:53,386 --> 00:50:56,354
You know I have to feel sad in order
to be comforted, right?

417
00:50:56,355 --> 00:50:58,393
I know you're never sad...

418
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:02,067
It must be terrible never to feel anything.

419
00:51:02,068 --> 00:51:06,940
I don't know... maybe it's better that way.

420
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:11,695
In France I know a famous neurologist,
he's really good.

421
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:15,331
I'm sure he could do something for you.

422
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:19,167
Since your accident there
has been enormous progress...

423
00:51:19,168 --> 00:51:20,827
that way you could be...

424
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:21,536
Normal?

425
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:22,537
That's not what I meant.

426
00:51:22,538 --> 00:51:25,257
Don't worry about it, I
never feel sad, remember!

427
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:26,504
And tenderness?

428
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:32,261
Did you ever take a woman
in your arms and...

429
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:33,970
I can do that.

430
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,333
Sleep well?

431
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:46,668
Enough.

432
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:49,129
I have been thinking...

433
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:55,132
maybe it would be better
if you continued on your own way.

434
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:56,678
Okay-

435
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:58,179
Can you show me to this place?

436
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:02,726
You know what? Take a
fucking taxi, smart ass!

437
00:53:03,472 --> 00:53:05,065
<i>'</i> Okay!
- Okay!

438
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:08,151
And Clara...

439
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:11,655
about last night...

440
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,994
hanks for that. It was cool.

441
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:37,171
Inspector Anada?

442
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:38,674
Yes this is Clara...

443
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:43,389
Manit has been kidnapped...

444
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:46,106
I'm waiting for you... five minutes, okay.

445
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:54,489
This is where you'll die.

446
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:57,409
But first, a couple of questions.

447
00:53:57,609 --> 00:54:01,034
Answer them and we won't make you suffer.

448
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,161
Can I die somewhere else?

449
00:54:03,162 --> 00:54:04,574
What?

450
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:08,035
It's ugly here. Somewhere nicer...

451
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:08,707
What is he saying?

452
00:54:08,708 --> 00:54:11,423
No... this is a good place!

453
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:12,916
Oh my god,

454
00:54:13,473 --> 00:54:16,553
I think I have fallen into the hands
of the most tasteless killers in Bangkok.

455
00:54:16,554 --> 00:54:18,087
Shut the fuck up man!

456
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:21,513
Now you're gonna tell us
what the hell you're doing over here man!

457
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:23,434
Just this...

458
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:59,467
Oh shit man!

459
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:04,263
Are you guys cops or something?

460
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:07,604
No! Fuck off man.

461
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:10,812
Wrong answer.

462
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:13,777
Are you a cop?

463
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:15,403
Yeah... we're cops.

464
00:55:15,404 --> 00:55:18,114
From the 8th? 8th district?

465
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:21,114
No man! Shit...

466
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:25,039
You're gonna take me to your boss
or you'll never walk again.

467
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:27,957
How man?

468
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:34,997
Shit, you broke my arm... shit man!

469
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:38,298
It's an automatic, you
don't need both hands.

470
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,258
You are not gonna win this, you know.

471
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,888
This is too big for you.

472
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:45,466
You're gonna end up blown away. Shit!

473
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:46,935
Shut up and drive.

474
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:55,694
We have to be quick we must find him.

475
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:58,271
I already put the details
of the car on wire

476
00:55:58,272 --> 00:56:01,446
but if you really want me to help you,
you need to tell me more...

477
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:03,619
I've only know him three days.

478
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:07,035
You are a journalist...
you sense things... no?

479
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:13,662
Al I have is a file that his mother
left him before she died.

480
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,836
It contains documents
that could incriminate

481
00:56:16,837 --> 00:56:20,336
corrupt cops concerning the
murder of his parents.

482
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:24,839
Now that is interesting. Where is it?

483
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:29,346
At my place... but there
must be police officers!

484
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:33,357
Look... you trust me so let's go get it!

485
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:43,780
These guys are screwing up
the whole goddamn system.

486
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:47,071
They must be found and eliminated.

487
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:50,787
I want to talk to Jessy.

488
00:56:52,701 --> 00:56:54,829
Nobody talks to the boss.

489
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,884
I do not speak to the Fanky.

490
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:17,646
Anything else?

491
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,063
I work alone.

492
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:22,864
Alone?

493
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:27,278
Who the hell do you think has been selling
your shit for the last two last years?

494
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,572
And that goes for all of you.

495
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:33,491
Thanks to Jessy you are comfortably rich..

496
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:37,463
Without her network
what do you think you'd be able to export?

497
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:38,751
10 kilos?

498
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:43,127
With her you've got 5
tons a year out there.

499
00:57:44,753 --> 00:57:46,255
What's the plan?

500
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:51,142
Tell your men. Find them and kill them.

501
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:55,226
Jessy wants their heads
on her desk in 48 hours.

502
00:57:56,098 --> 00:58:00,604
If you want your money
the concert is still on.

503
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,403
Hey you like classical music, do you?

504
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,071
Not a lot.

505
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:09,995
Who's this girl singing here?
She's quite good.

506
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:13,790
I don't know man.

507
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:17,081
What's your first name?

508
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:19,917
Why?

509
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:23,834
I don't know just want to establish
a sort of friendship. I'm Manit.

510
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,211
Sanouk!

511
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:31,475
Well Sanouk, my friend,
you think I'm an idiot, don't you?

512
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:37,680
Let's start again. The lady singing
on this CD do you know who she is?

513
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:41,642
That's Jessy Yiouchenko or something man.

514
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:42,143
Go on...

515
00:58:42,144 --> 00:58:44,146
If I talk, I'm dead man.

516
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:46,824
And if you don't you think
you're gonna get married?

517
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:54,699
She runs a network of heroin trafficking
between Thailand and South America.

518
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,287
How?

519
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:02,794
Thanks to the concerts.
The shit goes with the orchestra.

520
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:08,971
As she's famous and the shows run
by the embassies mostly,

521
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,719
there are no custom checks, you know.

522
00:59:12,841 --> 00:59:14,218
And who's above her?

523
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:16,769
I don't know!

524
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:20,102
Well more pain is on its way I'm afraid...

525
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:52,588
Come quick we are after him!

526
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:53,841
We're coming!

527
01:00:08,897 --> 01:00:10,695
Oh damn that feels good!

528
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,339
What's going on?

529
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:55,531
Get off!

530
01:03:59,294 --> 01:04:00,511
I need your head!

531
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:03,677
And I need your balls!

532
01:04:29,074 --> 01:04:31,372
We're Police! Police!

533
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:35,881
Freeze... Put your gun down...
Put your gun down.

534
01:04:43,922 --> 01:04:46,300
It's done... We've got them.

535
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:08,155
I am asking you. What
do they want from you?

536
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:12,868
Do you understand me?

537
01:05:13,535 --> 01:05:16,914
You won't get away with
causing all this trouble.

538
01:05:17,122 --> 01:05:19,875
Do you know we've been watching you?

539
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:21,216
Do you.

540
01:05:22,244 --> 01:05:24,004
If I had known I would
have brushed my hair.

541
01:05:24,005 --> 01:05:25,504
Why do you speak in English?

542
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:27,382
If I told you, you'd never believe me.

543
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:32,219
Okay, English is fine...
But you'd better talk to me.

544
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:37,015
If you want protection just come up
with something... so trust me.

545
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:41,145
I don't want protection and trust has
to be earned not demanded.

546
01:05:41,146 --> 01:05:43,399
True... but you are still
in deep shit anyway...

547
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:46,322
So are you. You have to clean out
your own stable first.

548
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:51,661
I'm the head of an anti-corruption brigade

549
01:05:51,662 --> 01:05:55,617
and I'm fighting with all
my strength to uncover

550
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:59,623
and punish those who contaminate
the force because of what?

551
01:06:00,123 --> 01:06:02,082
They insult the country.

552
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:03,922
My father said the same thing.

553
01:06:03,923 --> 01:06:07,673
And he died for it, along with the rest
of the members of his section...

554
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:13,429
You wanna know why I'm here?
Not for revenge but for justice.

555
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:20,193
Fine, if you want to follow
your role, just do it.

556
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:21,439
And you know what?

557
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:27,864
If anything goes wrong I will arrest you
like the rest, even if your Samat's son.

558
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:32,448
To each his duty... and what about Simon?

559
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:34,661
He'll be busted.

560
01:06:46,461 --> 01:06:47,587
So...

561
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:51,474
Mr. Simon Weber.

562
01:06:51,883 --> 01:06:54,682
No one's called me that
in such a long time.

563
01:06:54,969 --> 01:07:00,601
Or should I call you ex-French detective
Inspector Weber?

564
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:04,438
You can call me whatever you want...
I really couldn't give a shit.

565
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:07,481
I have an Interpol warrant for your arrest.

566
01:07:07,482 --> 01:07:09,947
Don't you have a whisky also by any chance?

567
01:07:09,948 --> 01:07:12,116
Your friends accused you of having

568
01:07:12,117 --> 01:07:16,240
stolen 15,000 euros from drug traffickers.

569
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:17,413
With ice...

570
01:07:17,909 --> 01:07:23,882
Personally I have nothing up against you
but you betrayed your oath.

571
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:30,006
If I betrayed somebody it was me, just me.

572
01:07:30,338 --> 01:07:31,338
How about your wife?

573
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:32,215
Died.

574
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:33,182
Sorry...

575
01:07:33,341 --> 01:07:35,810
Why? Did you kill her?

576
01:07:37,679 --> 01:07:39,352
Smoking kills.

577
01:07:40,223 --> 01:07:41,850
Assholes too...

578
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:07,880
Do you want me to get you out?

579
01:08:09,544 --> 01:08:13,048
No, I have lots of questions
and I think the answers might be here.

580
01:08:13,049 --> 01:08:14,264
Thanks for your help.

581
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:17,386
I don't like injustice... real one.

582
01:08:17,387 --> 01:08:20,685
And I think you're special,
I like people who are different.

583
01:08:21,556 --> 01:08:23,229
Okay, I'm out of here.

584
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:25,518
Hey!

585
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:31,900
I don't think you can
kill pain with more pain!

586
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:49,129
Hey Manit.

587
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:50,585
Anada

588
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:53,588
Clara and I have been
looking everywhere for you.

589
01:08:53,755 --> 01:08:54,847
Well you found me.

590
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:58,303
Come on I'll get you out of here.
Let's go get Clara.

591
01:08:58,304 --> 01:08:59,928
And what about Inspector Pitchai?

592
01:08:59,929 --> 01:09:01,929
Don't worry I already talked to him...

593
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:06,350
Come on, let's go.

594
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:07,273
Cool

595
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:12,448
Clara just called.

596
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:16,821
She said she found out some really
interesting things about your family.

597
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,914
Something that could explain everything.

598
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:21,950
This will all be over soon.

599
01:09:22,283 --> 01:09:23,455
It's not over yet...

600
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:32,589
You recognize this?

601
01:09:32,590 --> 01:09:33,552
Yeah!

602
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:35,380
Come on let's go in.

603
01:09:38,549 --> 01:09:43,271
When your father was killed his colleagues
did this for him to pay his respect...

604
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:48,643
You think you can get in?

605
01:09:49,644 --> 01:09:51,112
I was able to get out!

606
01:09:55,566 --> 01:09:56,441
Clara.

607
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:57,359
Get in!

608
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,327
Is that a gun?

609
01:09:58,528 --> 01:09:59,871
Get in!

610
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:02,540
Hey Clara, how are you doing?

611
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:06,582
You're alright? It's my friend Anada.

612
01:10:06,828 --> 01:10:08,671
You wouldn't want another one would you?

613
01:10:08,672 --> 01:10:10,882
How knows it might cure you!

614
01:10:11,249 --> 01:10:14,002
I was the one who screwed
you on district 8.

615
01:10:24,137 --> 01:10:25,810
Anada, enough!

616
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:32,275
You can never be too careful...
you prefer English...

617
01:10:32,854 --> 01:10:34,902
Why is that? You're Thai like us!

618
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:36,987
If I told you, you'd never believe me...

619
01:10:38,276 --> 01:10:40,028
Allow me to make the introductions.

620
01:10:40,445 --> 01:10:41,788
Is that necessary?

621
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:47,247
I am Sanya Wurapong,
I was your father's superior.

622
01:10:47,702 --> 01:10:51,297
I think it's nice for you to get to know
the person who made your life this way.

623
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:52,915
Shall I take a seat?

624
01:10:53,442 --> 01:10:55,802
I feel this is going to be rather long
and very complicated.

625
01:10:55,803 --> 01:10:59,764
I like your sense of humor.
Permit me to tell you a little story.

626
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:04,853
Once upon a time there
was this young inspector

627
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:07,646
whose boss sent him to
work with us undercover.

628
01:11:07,647 --> 01:11:12,314
He was unmasked, questioned
and convinced to work with us.

629
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:16,860
So much so that we could lead his boss
to believe that he was dead.

630
01:11:16,861 --> 01:11:19,234
Not too difficult to find a replacement...

631
01:11:19,235 --> 01:11:22,903
I think you know the rest,
and now you come back

632
01:11:22,904 --> 01:11:25,407
and stick your nose into
our business affair...

633
01:11:25,408 --> 01:11:28,626
You know you're just like your father
before he turned vigilante.

634
01:11:28,785 --> 01:11:29,998
He was doing his duty.

635
01:11:29,999 --> 01:11:32,873
My father sacrificed his
life because of you!

636
01:11:32,874 --> 01:11:35,591
Well... being a traitor must be
a genetic condition.

637
01:11:36,751 --> 01:11:42,964
Hey cool it! I'm sure you understand you
can't leave here alive. You have to die.

638
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:46,265
You're too late... l am already dead.

639
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:14,288
Memories?

640
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:16,625
So far so good.

641
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:20,003
This scene won't be complete
without the final touches...

642
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:23,047
Ever thought about going
into the movie business?

643
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:25,967
Finish it Narai.

644
01:12:29,262 --> 01:12:30,639
Have fun boys!

645
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:34,066
Sorry little boy...

646
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:11,534
Sanya!

647
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:27,340
Freeze.

648
01:17:17,424 --> 01:17:19,142
How do you feel?

649
01:17:22,763 --> 01:17:26,766
How do I feel? I feel like fucking shit!

650
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:29,111
I have got fucking holes in my legs...

651
01:17:30,729 --> 01:17:35,155
I feel bad! I feel bad!

652
01:17:36,443 --> 01:17:39,117
Welcome to the world of the living!

653
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:42,992
Your father would be proud of you...

654
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:52,881
Well, thanks for your help...

655
01:17:57,131 --> 01:17:58,132
Good luck.

656
01:18:00,301 --> 01:18:02,645
Thank you for coming to save me.

657
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:07,187
It's starting to feel like a full time job!

658
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:11,649
I love you...

659
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:13,113
Huh?

660
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:15,361
I love you.

661
01:18:39,882 --> 01:18:43,512
Mr. Simon...

662
01:18:44,178 --> 01:18:48,900
and Mr. Nicky!
