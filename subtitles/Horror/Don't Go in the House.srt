00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:36,389
Hey Donny, watch your eyes, man.

2
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:08,154
Yo, Ben. You coming
to lunch or what?

3
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:11,507
- No, I got to take my kid to the
doctor. - Okay. See you later.

4
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,542
Hey, he's over here!

5
00:02:56,803 --> 00:02:59,080
Stupid son of a bitch!
What are you standing there for?

6
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,183
You hear me you crazy bastard?
Come over here and help us!

7
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:05,628
- What's the matter with you? - Leave
him alone! Let's take care of Ben!

8
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:08,064
Yeah, let's take care of Ben.

9
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:10,274
Take his visor off.

10
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:14,070
Give me a hand here.

11
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:40,179
You realize Ben nearly
died because of you?

12
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:45,418
A man goes up in flames and you
stand there like a faggot.

13
00:03:45,518 --> 00:03:46,978
I'm not a faggot.

14
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:49,422
- What?
- I'm not a faggot.

15
00:03:49,522 --> 00:03:51,507
It just covered.
It covered him up.

16
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:54,135
He wasn't evil
but it covered him up.

17
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:56,637
What are you talking about?
I covered Ben!

18
00:03:56,737 --> 00:04:00,450
No. The cover of flame.
The cover of the flame.

19
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:02,410
You know you're crazy.

20
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:04,354
I always said you were crazy.

21
00:04:04,454 --> 00:04:06,247
You stay away from me.

22
00:04:06,706 --> 00:04:08,499
You think I was afraid?

23
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,918
You think I'm crazy?

24
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:14,714
- What are you talking about?
- I would have helped him.

25
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:19,427
You're a sicko.

Hey, Donny.
Donny, wait a minute.

28
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:54,921
Hey, let's go have a beer, man.

29
00:04:55,213 --> 00:04:57,448
No thanks, uh, I got to get home.

30
00:04:57,548 --> 00:05:00,159
Oh well, so do I. Let's go
have a beer anyway. Come on.

31
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:03,721
- I can't. My mother's sick.
- Okay. But wait a minute, now listen.

32
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,290
I don't want you to go home
thinking that was your fault, man,

33
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,937
because I mean things can happen and a guy
can freeze in a situation like that, you know.

34
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:13,381
- Hey, that's right.
- Yeah.

35

That's right.

36
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,717
He's the one that's sick.

37
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:20,138
- He's the faggot, not me. - Yeah,
you're probably right about that.

38
00:05:20,238 --> 00:05:22,098
You know that's the
way those people are.

39
00:05:22,198 --> 00:05:26,727
- They call you names and they're the crazy ones.
- He's a lightweight. Don't worry about it.

40
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,730
But that's the way it happened.
You're right, Bobby.

41
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,910
- Hey, I froze. I couldn't do anything.
- Hey, you know, speaking of freezing,

42
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,362
I'm gonna go find a nice warm barstool.
Why don't you come along, huh?

43
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:38,422
Nah, I can't.

44
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:40,992
Okay. Alright.
I'll see you tomorrow. Okay?

45
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:43,052
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

Don't you want your tea?

00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:30,469
I made your tea.

55
00:08:31,971 --> 00:08:33,305
Mother?

56
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:35,975
Mother, are you all right?

No.

It's not true.

It's not...

66
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,789
She's gonna wake up.

She's just asleep.

68

Oh, that's beautiful.

I'm sure mother will love that.

150

Well, I guess that will do it.
That's $4.50 please.

Mother will feel fine.

155

Just fine.

156

Good night.

157

Good night.

158
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:59,282

- Yeah, you're right, man.

159
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:00,951
I ought to know.

160

Hey, hold it!

161
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:18,260
Hey, I'd wait for her.

162
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:22,264
Hey baby, I'll walk you home.

163
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:27,294
Now she looks back, come on.

164
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:29,521
Maybe you should try and make her.

165
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,727
Hey, Miss, I can give you a lift
to the next bus station.

166
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,032
- Baby, I'll give you a ride.
- That's the way I go.

167
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:46,021
Well, I'm going to River Road.

168
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:49,082
I go right passed there.
I could give you a lift.

169
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:53,528
Okay.

170
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:57,574
- No, don't go. Don't leave us now.
- Come back. Come on.

171
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:59,993
- We blew it.
- Oh, man, we blew it.

172
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:03,305
Oh, you broke my heart.
Oh woe is me.

173
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:07,809
I appreciate your help.

174
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:10,270
My pleasure.

175
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:14,466
I ought to thank you
for letting me get these flowers.

176
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:17,386
If it wasn't for me
you would have made your bus.

177
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:20,739
You know, you should get these in
water as soon as you get home.

178
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,682
Oh yeah?

179
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,534
I'll do that.

180
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,026
Are you in a big rush?

181
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:35,253
Well, yeah, I want to get home.

182
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:39,408
Would you mind if I drop these
off at my house first?

183
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:42,552
It will only take a minute.
It's not far from River Road.

184
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:45,163
- All right.
- My mother is

185
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:47,165
already fixing dinner

186
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:49,084
and I'm really late.

187
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,628
So, I'll just drop them off and
I'll tell her I'll be right back.

188
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:53,438
No, no, it's all right.

189
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,827
I'll only be a minute.

190
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:16,253
Hey, I forgot the package.

191
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,255
Could you hand me that?

192
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,131
Thanks.

193
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:22,909
Hey, why don't you come on in
and say hello to mother?

194
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:25,412
- No, no.
- She'll get a kick out of it.

195
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:27,205
- And then we could go.
- No, really,

196
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:30,225
- I have to get home.
- Come on. She never sees anybody.

197
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:32,627
- Really, I just want to...
- Ah, come on.

198
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:34,938
- Please.
- Okay.

199
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:36,982
(whispers) Christ.

200
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:39,109
Careful now.

201
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:08,054
Mother, I'm home.

202
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,768
- Make yourself at home.
I'll be right back. - Okay.

203
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:16,338
- Hey, I don't even know your name.
- Kathy.

204
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:18,882
- Kathy Jordan.
- I'm Donny Kohler.

205
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:20,609
Donald, you know.

206
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,485
It's nice to meet you.

207
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:25,363
Well, let me go get mother.

208
00:24:57,956 --> 00:24:59,708
Mother must be upstairs.

209
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:05,630
Mother! Mother!

210
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:37,354
Mother is even sicker than I thought. I have
to call a doctor and get him right over here.

211
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:40,039
You understand.
I can't leave her in this condition.

212
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:43,585
As soon as you've finished
I'd like to call a cab.

213
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:53,370
Dr. Wells? This is Donald Kohler.
It's mother again.

214
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:56,706
She's worse than before.
She can't get out of bed.

215
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:58,500
Could you come right over?

216
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,976
Yes.

217
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:02,003
Oh, would you?

218
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:03,563
Would you?

219
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:05,482
Thank you very much.

220
00:26:06,952 --> 00:26:10,512
The doctor will be right over. If you wait a
couple of minutes I can give you a ride home.

221
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:12,847
Look. I know you have
your hands full here,

222
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:15,100
I'd just like to call a cab, okay?

223
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,204
- But if you wait a few minutes, the doctor...
- Look, may I please use the phone?

224
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:23,733
- Are you asking for my permission?
- Yes.

225
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:26,419
May I please use the phone?

226
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:29,614
Yes!

227
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:31,299
You may.

228
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:49,317
Hello, would please send a cab to...

229
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:24,686
Oh please, help!

230
00:27:39,242 --> 00:27:41,786
Donald, come here!

231
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:07,020
Help me!

232
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:22,519
Please help me!

233
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:24,287
Help me!

234
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:27,874
Oh no!

235
00:29:16,506 --> 00:29:17,882
God!

236
00:29:21,886 --> 00:29:25,640
Please, God, no!

237
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,436
No!

238
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,441
Please!

239
00:30:54,312 --> 00:30:56,214
You're a friend of that nut,

240
00:30:56,314 --> 00:30:58,995
you tell him for me if he isn't back
here Monday, he's out of a job.

241
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:01,719
Give the guy a break. He's
been sick. He's got problems.

242
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:03,096
- Sick?
- Yeah.

243
00:31:03,196 --> 00:31:06,307
- If so, how come he doesn't answer the
phone? - Didn't his mother answer?

244
00:31:06,407 --> 00:31:09,268
- Nobody answers.
- Maybe he's taken her to the doctor.

245
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:12,689
Look, I don't care if they took
each other to the doctor.

246
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:15,458
He's been out a week
now and that's it.

247
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:18,377
Ben will be in the hospital
for at least a month.

248
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:22,924
You just tell him what I said.

249
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:24,443
- Can't get it started? - It just stalled
out on me. It won't do anything.

250
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:28,531
- Could I give you a lift to the next gas station?
- Oh, I'd really appreciate that.

251
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:42,361
You won't mind if I drop these
things off at my house first?

252
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:44,922
- It's on the way.
- No, that's okay.

253
00:33:54,242 --> 00:33:59,288
And when I tell you not to take something
off a shelf you better listen to me.

254
00:34:21,978 --> 00:34:23,479
Will that be all?

255
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:26,774
Uh, and two packs of one-twenty.

256
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,500
That's $4.99 out of five.

257
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:46,252
Thank you.

258
00:34:58,848 --> 00:35:00,308
There you go.

259
00:35:01,392 --> 00:35:03,753
- Can I help you with that package?
- No, thanks.

260
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:05,379
Can I give you a ride home?

261
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:08,216
My truck is right outside. Why don't
you let me give you a ride home?

262
00:35:08,316 --> 00:35:10,468
- Would you please just get out of my way?
- It's right outside. I just could...

263
00:35:10,568 --> 00:35:12,136
Is there a problem here?

264
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:14,388
No, there is no problem.
No problem.

265
00:35:14,488 --> 00:35:18,576
I must have scared her, huh? I'm
going to apologize. Hey, Miss! Miss!

266
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:39,747
Mother, this is Linda.

267
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:43,476
I wanted you to meet here before
I introduced her to the others.

268
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:53,010
<i>- Hello?
- Hey Donny.</i>

269
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,595
It's Bobby.

270
00:35:54,695 --> 00:35:56,430
<i>Oh, hi Bobby.</i>

271
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:58,349
Hi, hey listen, man,

272
00:35:58,449 --> 00:36:00,910
I got a message from Vito for you.

273
00:36:01,118 --> 00:36:04,313
He says if you don' show
up to work on Monday,

274
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:06,374
<i>you're out of a job.</i>

275
00:36:09,502 --> 00:36:11,921
<i>Hey Donny, did you hear what I said?</i>

276
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:17,410
<i>Okay, listen, man, all I'm trying
to do is help you out, you know,</i>

277
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:20,830
and all you giving me is nothing,
so have a nice life, huh.

278
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:23,516
<i>Wait a minute!
Listen to me, Bobby.</i>

279
00:36:23,891 --> 00:36:25,726
Hey, I'm in a lot of trouble.

280
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,546
<i>I'm, I'm scared.</i>

281
00:36:28,646 --> 00:36:30,606
What kind of trouble?
What's the matter?

282
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,967
It's my mother.

283
00:36:33,067 --> 00:36:34,677
She's sick,

284
00:36:34,777 --> 00:36:36,445
you know, and

285
00:36:37,655 --> 00:36:40,808
well I'm real worried, Bobby.

286
00:36:40,908 --> 00:36:43,227
You want me to come over,
we can talk about it.

287
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:45,413
No, no, you can't
come over right now.

288
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:48,332
Father Gerritty's gonna come over

289
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:51,819
because

290
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:55,323
my mother is sick and she hasn't
been able to get to church.

291
00:36:55,423 --> 00:36:59,510
Now wait a minute, Gerritty? Now what's
that old witch doctor going to do for her?

292
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:03,205
Well, he knows what to do.

293
00:37:03,305 --> 00:37:05,207
<i>- He knows.
- Okay, okay.</i>

294
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:08,377
But now listen, gimme a call
if you need anything.

295
00:37:08,477 --> 00:37:09,879
<i>Hey, Donny,</i>

296
00:37:09,979 --> 00:37:14,066
<i>I really hope that you get
to work on Monday, man.</i>

297
00:37:15,151 --> 00:37:16,735
Listen, Bobby,

298
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,447
thanks for calling me.

299
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:24,118
I think you're the only friend
I have out there.

300
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:27,455
It's all right.
I'll see you, man.

301
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:44,513
Trash!

302
00:37:44,722 --> 00:37:48,000
Trash! Trash! Just like your father!

303
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,002
- No!
- Oh yes!

304
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:52,004
He got away, but you won't.

305
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:54,340
You'll pay, you'll suffer.

306
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,443
No. You'll have to suffer now.

307
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:00,554
<i>(She's evil. She
can't hurt you now.)</i>

308
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:03,641
<i>(Remember, punish her.
We'll help you.)</i>

309
00:38:03,741 --> 00:38:05,534
That's right.

310
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:08,829
I have my friends with me.

311
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:14,293
If she doesn't stop it,
I'll punish her again.

312
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,029
You hear that, old lady?

313
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:19,840
I'll punish you again!

314
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:28,999
Did you hear me?
Did you hear what I said?

315
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:31,602
Don't you ever talk to me like that.

316
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:34,063
That's better.

317
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:41,971
Don't make me do
anything bad, Mother.

318
00:38:42,071 --> 00:38:44,490
(giggling)

319
00:38:46,534 --> 00:38:48,310
You laughing at me?

320
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:51,121
You think I'm crazy for talking
to my mother like that?

321
00:38:55,876 --> 00:38:57,862
You're all bitches,

322
00:38:57,962 --> 00:39:00,130
selfish and vain.

323
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:03,384
Don't you dare laugh at me.

324
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:11,267
I won't stand for impudence
from any of you.

325
00:39:13,477 --> 00:39:16,464
And stop trying to
scare me all the time.

326
00:39:16,564 --> 00:39:19,149
It won't work.
You can't fool me.

327
00:39:21,569 --> 00:39:23,862
If you promise to be good

328
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:27,408
I'll leave the lights on.

329
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:31,203
And remember,

330
00:39:32,663 --> 00:39:34,790
no more laughing.

331
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:49,296
I'll get you, Donald!

332
00:44:49,396 --> 00:44:51,231
I'll get you!

333
00:46:36,086 --> 00:46:37,754
What are you doing here?

334
00:46:37,963 --> 00:46:40,699
Donny. Donny Kohler.

335
00:46:40,799 --> 00:46:43,301
I thought you told me
you'd never come back here.

336
00:46:45,095 --> 00:46:48,807
Oh, you came to get holy water.
You don't have to steal it.

337
00:46:49,558 --> 00:46:51,585
Doesn't it put out the flame?

338
00:46:51,685 --> 00:46:53,311
The flame?

339
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:55,422
You have a problem?

340
00:46:55,522 --> 00:46:56,940
Yes.

341
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:59,026
Let me help you with this.

342
00:47:09,161 --> 00:47:10,938
Do you believe in the devil?

343
00:47:11,038 --> 00:47:13,774
What kind of a question
is that to ask a priest?

344
00:47:13,874 --> 00:47:15,150
Do you?

345
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:18,820
I believe in evil, yes,
but not in the devil.

346
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,614
But I've seen the devil.

347
00:47:20,714 --> 00:47:22,908
No, it's in your mind, Donny.

348
00:47:23,008 --> 00:47:26,244
The devil is only a symbol.
A symbol of evil.

349
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:28,538
Evil lives only if we let it.

350
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:30,707
So you don't believe that it exists?

351
00:47:30,807 --> 00:47:33,435
No, it doesn't exist.

352
00:47:33,602 --> 00:47:35,170
Only if you want it to.

353
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:37,172
You have all the answers.

354
00:47:37,272 --> 00:47:39,716
All the things you read in books.

355
00:47:39,816 --> 00:47:42,277
All the things you tell people.

356
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:49,101
Look at these symbols.

357
00:47:49,201 --> 00:47:51,228
I was burned, just like in hell!

358
00:47:51,328 --> 00:47:52,813
What is this?

359
00:47:52,913 --> 00:47:54,873
What happened to your arms?

360
00:47:56,083 --> 00:47:58,835
It was the punishment for my sins.

361
00:47:59,211 --> 00:48:00,837
Who did this to you?

362
00:48:03,715 --> 00:48:05,425
Tell me!

363
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,929
My mother.

364
00:48:09,846 --> 00:48:11,556
My mother.

365
00:48:11,973 --> 00:48:13,558
Help me.

366
00:48:14,101 --> 00:48:16,128
You mean your mother
did this to you?

367
00:48:16,228 --> 00:48:17,938
But Why?

368
00:48:18,313 --> 00:48:20,398
Because I was evil.

369
00:48:22,109 --> 00:48:25,070
I was born from an evil deed.

370
00:48:26,113 --> 00:48:29,574
She was burning it out
of me to save me.

371
00:48:32,285 --> 00:48:34,246
If I was bad,

372
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:36,581
she burned me.

373
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:39,417
If I had evil thoughts,

374
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:41,753
she would burn me.

375
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:46,758
Do you understand me?

376
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:50,537
But Donny, you must forgive those
who trespassed.

377
00:48:50,637 --> 00:48:52,597
You must forgive your mother.

378
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:03,608
Donny,

379
00:49:05,777 --> 00:49:08,613
I want to help you.
Do you believe me?

380
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:10,265
Yes.

381
00:49:10,365 --> 00:49:12,117
Do you want my help?

382
00:49:12,826 --> 00:49:14,227
Yes.

383
00:49:14,327 --> 00:49:16,313
Then do as I tell you.

384
00:49:16,413 --> 00:49:19,875
Put these thoughts of evil
out of your mind now.

385
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,044
Resist them and you'll find peace.

386
00:49:23,295 --> 00:49:25,046
Don't you want that?

387
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:28,258
Yes. Yes I do.

388
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:30,927
But there are other things,

389
00:49:31,428 --> 00:49:32,929
other people.

390
00:49:33,346 --> 00:49:35,223
Come back to me.

391
00:49:36,183 --> 00:49:39,336
Come to my office or come to
confession if you like.

392
00:49:39,436 --> 00:49:41,421
You haven't been in
a while, have you?

393
00:49:41,521 --> 00:49:43,481
Only come back and see me.

394
00:50:30,862 --> 00:50:32,906
Mother, please forgive me.

395
00:50:33,657 --> 00:50:36,393
I told the priest because
he wanted to help me.

396
00:50:36,493 --> 00:50:38,453
I didn't do anything wrong.

397
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:43,250
I can change.

398
00:50:45,293 --> 00:50:47,254
I want to forget our past.

399
00:50:49,464 --> 00:50:51,383
I want to forgive you.

400
00:51:14,823 --> 00:51:16,408
Please,

401
00:51:17,659 --> 00:51:19,494
help me forgive her.

402
00:52:29,856 --> 00:52:31,441
Hello?

403
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:33,218
Is Bobby there?

404
00:52:33,318 --> 00:52:35,445
Bob, it's for you.

405
00:52:41,117 --> 00:52:43,286
<i>- Hello?
- Hello Bobby?</i>

406
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:46,289
<i>- Yeah, who's this?
- It's Donny.</i>

407
00:52:46,873 --> 00:52:51,361
Hey, Donny. This is a surprise,
what are you up to, man?

408
00:52:51,461 --> 00:52:54,422
Nothing.
I'm not up to nothing.

409
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:58,134
I just thought you might want to go
to a movie or something.

410
00:52:58,343 --> 00:53:01,246
Now wait a minute.
Let me get this straight,

411
00:53:01,346 --> 00:53:04,265
you're sure you don't want to
stay home tonight?

412
00:53:04,474 --> 00:53:05,975
Come on.

413
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:11,381
Listen, if you're really serious
about doing something tonight,

414
00:53:11,481 --> 00:53:15,443
I got something we can do, man,
and it ain't no movie, you know.

415
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:17,779
<i>Oh yeah? What?</i>

416
00:53:18,488 --> 00:53:20,990
Guess what I got lined
up for tonight.

417
00:53:21,658 --> 00:53:23,118
Two.

418
00:53:23,326 --> 00:53:25,437
Two live ones, man,

419
00:53:25,537 --> 00:53:28,289
and let me tell you
they are dynamite.

420
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:32,252
You know what they're into?

421
00:53:32,544 --> 00:53:34,337
No, what?

422
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:39,659
I can't go into detail right now but
take my word for it, they are dynamite.

423
00:53:39,759 --> 00:53:42,329
Well, I thought we could

424
00:53:42,429 --> 00:53:44,556
spend kind of a

425
00:53:44,764 --> 00:53:48,226
quite night together.
Just talk or something like that.

426
00:53:48,476 --> 00:53:50,337
Are you kidding?
This is perfect.

427
00:53:50,437 --> 00:53:53,423
Now, my wife thinks I'm working
the weekend shift, okay.

428
00:53:53,523 --> 00:53:57,052
I got all the calls made,
my ass is covered,

429
00:53:57,152 --> 00:54:00,889
and I don't feel like sitting in some
dumb movie holding your hand. No offense.

430
00:54:00,989 --> 00:54:03,016
Well, wait a minute,
I didn't mean that.

431
00:54:03,116 --> 00:54:06,770
<i>Look, meet me at the Palace Disco tonight
at 8 o'clock, all right? That's it.</i>

432
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:09,105
<i>- What if I can't be there?
- Look,</i>

433
00:54:09,205 --> 00:54:11,958
I'll see you at 8, okay?

434
00:54:12,459 --> 00:54:15,695
Okay, Bobby.
I'll see you at 8.

435
00:54:15,795 --> 00:54:17,255
See you then.

436
00:54:24,012 --> 00:54:27,515
Bob, I'm gonna kill this kid
if you don't get him out of here.

437
00:55:14,562 --> 00:55:16,773
Oh, these are nice.

438
00:55:17,065 --> 00:55:20,235
And here is another item I think
you really want to have a look.

439
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:23,571
Come on, let's go.

440
00:55:23,988 --> 00:55:25,515
Okay, thanks anyway.

441
00:55:25,615 --> 00:55:27,976
I'm sorry I couldn't
have been of more help.

442
00:55:28,076 --> 00:55:29,702
BYE bye.

443
00:55:38,795 --> 00:55:40,922
Yes, sir. Can I be of help to you?

444
00:55:41,089 --> 00:55:44,367
Ah, well, could you
show me that shirt?

445
00:55:44,467 --> 00:55:47,262
- The one they were looking at.
- Oh, sure.

446
00:55:48,054 --> 00:55:49,556
The red one.

447
00:55:50,056 --> 00:55:51,891
Oh, the Matador.

448
00:55:54,602 --> 00:55:58,273
- The Matador? - The shirt. The
styling. That's what its called.

449
00:55:58,565 --> 00:56:00,275
Oh yes.

450
00:56:00,567 --> 00:56:03,278
I forgot. The Matador.
I've seen this before.

451
00:56:04,487 --> 00:56:05,889
Very interesting.

452
00:56:05,989 --> 00:56:07,407
Yes.

453
00:56:07,657 --> 00:56:09,284
Nice styling.

454
00:56:12,495 --> 00:56:14,230
What did that lady think?

455
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:16,124
She liked it, didn't she?

456
00:56:16,916 --> 00:56:19,335
To tell you the truth
she thought it was tacky.

457
00:56:19,794 --> 00:56:21,212
<i>Oh.</i>

458
00:56:22,213 --> 00:56:23,881
What do you think?

459
00:56:24,591 --> 00:56:29,220
If you could tell me if this is for a business occasion
or a casual affair I could be of much more help.

460
00:56:29,554 --> 00:56:33,349
Well, I was looking for something
that you could wear to a disco.

461
00:56:33,516 --> 00:56:36,769
Okay. Let's get to the right department,
shall we? Just come this way.

462
00:56:41,316 --> 00:56:43,359
I just got these in.

463
00:56:44,152 --> 00:56:46,029
This is what they're all wearing.

464
00:56:49,949 --> 00:56:53,369
Unless you're into the more wild
look, which is really passe'.

465
00:56:54,829 --> 00:56:56,873
That's a beautiful plaid, isn't it?

466
00:56:57,373 --> 00:57:00,793
Well, I'll tell you the truth, for the disco
scene, I think this is what you want.

467
00:57:06,299 --> 00:57:08,076
Well, why don't you take that shirt?

468
00:57:08,176 --> 00:57:10,787
What size are you?
15 and a half?

469
00:57:10,887 --> 00:57:12,305
Yeah.

470
00:57:15,266 --> 00:57:16,851
There you are.

471
00:57:18,478 --> 00:57:20,938
Can I set you up with
an entire ensemble?

472
00:57:21,481 --> 00:57:22,840
Okay.

473
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,068
Great. Just come this way.

474
00:57:25,485 --> 00:57:28,071
I think we can make a new man
of you in no time.

475
00:57:37,205 --> 00:57:40,416
This three piece suit would be
terrific with that shirt.

476
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:44,462
Specially made for dancing.
Elastic thread in the seams.

477
00:57:44,629 --> 00:57:46,197
You'll look terrific in this.

478
00:57:46,297 --> 00:57:49,075
Listen, now why don't you just take
these in the dressing room

479
00:57:49,175 --> 00:57:50,868
and try them on? See if they fit.

480
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:53,705
No, that's all right.
I'll try them on at home.

481
00:57:53,805 --> 00:57:56,874
Well, fine now. We'll just get you
into a pair of shoes then, shall we?

482
00:57:56,974 --> 00:58:02,146
Alfred, could you fix this gentleman up
with a pair of fourteen thirty-twos please?

483
00:58:02,313 --> 00:58:03,798
Oh, your size, sir?

484
00:58:03,898 --> 00:58:06,693
I don't know.
Nine I think.

485
00:58:07,568 --> 00:58:09,445
Measure him, Alfred.

486
00:58:09,737 --> 00:58:12,765
Well, I just have these wrapped up
if they're satisfactory of course.

487
00:58:12,865 --> 00:58:15,952
- What do you think?
- I think it's a dynamite outfit.

488
00:58:16,119 --> 00:58:17,620
Really?

489
00:58:18,371 --> 00:58:20,373
You'll steal the show.

490
00:58:59,454 --> 00:59:04,417
Hey, there he is! Hey, Donny,
over here, baby! Over here!

491
00:59:05,251 --> 00:59:07,695
Hey, you're looking terrific, man.

492
00:59:07,795 --> 00:59:09,906
Let me introduce you to some people.
This is Farrah.

493
00:59:10,006 --> 00:59:11,449
- Hi.
- Hi.

494
00:59:11,549 --> 00:59:13,618
And this beautiful girl is Karen.

495
00:59:13,718 --> 00:59:16,621
- Hi, Donny.
- Here. Sit down, my man, sit down.

496
00:59:16,721 --> 00:59:18,706
Make yourself at home, my boy.

497
00:59:18,806 --> 00:59:21,417
Come here. Sit down, baby.
There you go.

498
00:59:21,517 --> 00:59:24,061
So, you work with Bobby
at the incinerator, huh?

499
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:26,147
Yes, we work together.

500
00:59:26,606 --> 00:59:31,903
Yeah, and don't be calling us trash or
making none of them garbage jokes of yours.

501
00:59:32,528 --> 00:59:35,448
You mean I have to can
those garbage jokes?

502
00:59:36,574 --> 00:59:39,285
Oh, look! He's getting
all burned up.

503
00:59:41,454 --> 00:59:44,165
- So, how do you like it there?
- It stinks.

504
00:59:46,542 --> 00:59:51,339
Yeah, well, you ain't gonna have to worry about that
if you don't show up to work on Monday.

505
00:59:51,506 --> 00:59:53,508
Why, are they gonna fire you?

506
00:59:53,674 --> 00:59:55,868
- You're damn right.
- I'll be there.

507
00:59:55,968 --> 00:59:57,553
I'm coming back Monday.

508
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:00,598
I hope so.
Come on, let's dance.

509
01:00:00,807 --> 01:00:03,100
I've heard enough of this rubbish.

510
01:00:05,603 --> 01:00:07,438
Let's go, baby.

511
01:00:12,568 --> 01:00:14,637
So, you've been missing work lately?

512
01:00:14,737 --> 01:00:17,573
Yeah, I've been sick.

513
01:00:17,824 --> 01:00:21,686
Is it anything contagious?
I mean I'd like to know beforehand.

514
01:00:21,786 --> 01:00:23,913
No. It's nothing like that.

515
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:25,940
I'm over it now anyway.

516
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,583
<i>Oh.</i>

517
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:46,018
- You wanna dance?
- No!

518
01:00:46,352 --> 01:00:48,187
I mean I don't dance.

519
01:00:48,604 --> 01:00:50,882
- Not at all?
- Not at all.

520
01:00:50,982 --> 01:00:52,842
- How you doing, babe?
- Fine, Tony.

521
01:00:52,942 --> 01:00:55,278
- You seen Barbara?
- No, uh uh.

522
01:00:59,657 --> 01:01:02,285
- Who's that?
- That was my brother.

523
01:01:09,876 --> 01:01:12,086
- Hi, Farrah. Come on, let's dance.
- Hi.

524
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:15,907
- You don't mind if I dance,
do you, Donny? - No. Go ahead.

525
01:01:16,007 --> 01:01:17,592
All right.

526
01:02:57,525 --> 01:02:59,068
No!

527
01:03:12,957 --> 01:03:16,168
Hey, what did you do?
What's the matter with you, man?

528
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:21,157
Jesus!

529
01:03:21,257 --> 01:03:23,367
- Hey, Anthony, Anthony.
- Hey, Sassoon, what's up?

530
01:03:23,467 --> 01:03:26,078
- Some guy just threw a candle in
your sister's face. - Holy shit!

531
01:03:26,178 --> 01:03:27,997
- What do you mean? What?!
- Yeah, that guy over there.

532
01:03:28,097 --> 01:03:29,640
Hey, you motherfucker!

533
01:03:38,482 --> 01:03:39,775
You!

534
01:03:45,322 --> 01:03:48,743
You scarred my sister for life!
You scarred her for life!

535
01:03:49,577 --> 01:03:51,495
Get away from me. Please.

536
01:03:51,704 --> 01:03:53,289
Leave me alone!

537
01:03:53,998 --> 01:03:55,416
Please!

538
01:04:07,970 --> 01:04:09,872
Hey, you sick son of a bitch.

539
01:04:09,972 --> 01:04:12,767
Get out of there!
Get the hell out of there!

540
01:04:14,018 --> 01:04:17,438
I'm going to kill you!
You ain't getting away with this!

541
01:04:23,694 --> 01:04:25,571
I'm not through with you!

542
01:04:36,457 --> 01:04:40,194
Where is Tony?
I can't believe what he did to me.

543
01:04:40,294 --> 01:04:41,904
Don't worry, I'll take care of him.

544
01:04:42,004 --> 01:04:45,424
And you your friend is a dead man.

545
01:04:45,758 --> 01:04:47,218
Dead.

546
01:04:54,975 --> 01:04:58,629
<i>(You're safe now, you're safe.
You got away, you did right.)</i>

547
01:04:58,729 --> 01:05:00,815
<i>(She was evil. Evil.)</i>

548
01:05:03,275 --> 01:05:05,594
- Did you pay the check?
- No.

549
01:05:05,694 --> 01:05:07,138
I thought you did.

550
01:05:07,238 --> 01:05:08,948
Hey, come on.

551
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:11,225
Hey, you missed us.

552
01:05:11,325 --> 01:05:14,979
- Come on. Shit. - Those guys
were ready to give us a lift.

553
01:05:15,079 --> 01:05:17,289
Don't worry, we'll get one.

554
01:05:18,541 --> 01:05:20,901
Oh yeah, fat chance.

555
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:22,461
Oh, it's freezing.

556
01:05:41,605 --> 01:05:45,134
Thanks a lot.
Oh God, you've had a bad night.

557
01:05:45,234 --> 01:05:46,761
Cut it out, Suzanne!

558
01:05:46,861 --> 01:05:49,513
Listen, could you take us to Rudy's?

559
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:52,016
- What's that?
- It's a bar, dummy.

560
01:05:52,116 --> 01:05:54,060
- Don't be a wise-ass, Suzanne.
- Sorry.

561
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,853
It's on 19.

562
01:05:55,953 --> 01:05:58,998
- Sure. Get in.
- Oh, great! Thanks.

563
01:06:13,304 --> 01:06:16,540
Excuse my appearance,
but I just got jumped.

564
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,292
- Really?
- What?

565
01:06:18,392 --> 01:06:20,060
He was jumped.

566
01:06:20,311 --> 01:06:22,813
Oh, you were? What happened?

567
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:25,132
A couple of guys came
out of no place.

568
01:06:25,232 --> 01:06:27,401
They jumped me in a parking lot.

569
01:06:27,818 --> 01:06:29,945
- Three of them.
- Really?

570
01:06:30,112 --> 01:06:32,515
- Yeah. Three guys with knives.
- Oh wow!

571
01:06:32,615 --> 01:06:34,909
- Just now?
- Yeah.

572
01:06:35,117 --> 01:06:37,311
- Where was this?
- Back in town.

573
01:06:37,411 --> 01:06:39,480
What did they do? Take your money?

574
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:41,290
They wanted to,

575
01:06:41,457 --> 01:06:42,858
but I showed them.

576
01:06:42,958 --> 01:06:46,195
They didn't know who they were messing with.
They thought they had themselves a real pushover.

577
01:06:46,295 --> 01:06:49,590
- What did you do? - I beat the
hell out of all three of them.

578
01:06:51,592 --> 01:06:55,429
I... I was in the marines.
Green berets.

579
01:06:56,805 --> 01:06:59,542
Well, I thought the green
berets was the Army.

580
01:06:59,642 --> 01:07:03,270
Oh, this was just like the green
berets. It was a special division.

581
01:07:07,816 --> 01:07:10,678
Patty, do you think
Jeff is gonna be there?

582
01:07:10,778 --> 01:07:14,473
- If Jeff is gonna be there, I don't wanna go.
- Are you gonna start with that again?

583
01:07:14,573 --> 01:07:17,518
- Who's Jeff?
- Oh, he's this real asshole.

584
01:07:17,618 --> 01:07:21,772
Don't worry. I'm sure that Janice and Billy
and all the rest are gonna be there.

585
01:07:21,872 --> 01:07:23,816
We'll sit with them.
Just ignore him.

586
01:07:23,916 --> 01:07:29,964
I can't just ignore him. He follows
me around. He's such a drag.

587
01:07:30,464 --> 01:07:32,825
You picked a helluva
time to start this.

588
01:07:32,925 --> 01:07:35,703
We're almost there and now all of a
sudden you decide you don't want to go.

589
01:07:35,803 --> 01:07:39,665
I just realized I don't want to be
hassled all night long.

590
01:07:39,765 --> 01:07:42,977
- Wait a minute. Hold it. Hold it.
- And what are we gonna do now?

591
01:07:43,477 --> 01:07:47,464
Take it easy. Why don't
we go to my house?

592
01:07:47,564 --> 01:07:51,360
You can call anybody you want to see in
there. We could have a party right there.

593
01:07:51,819 --> 01:07:53,721
Yeah? Nobody'll mind?

594
01:07:53,821 --> 01:07:56,390
- No.
- We can invite anybody we want?

595
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:59,076
Yeah. It's my house.

596
01:08:01,745 --> 01:08:06,417
Do you have any beer?
Because we're gonna need some beer.

597
01:08:07,293 --> 01:08:09,486
- We can stop and get beer.
- Great!

598
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:12,381
- Far out...
- A case should do it.

599
01:08:28,856 --> 01:08:32,067
Oh God, this is a spooky house.

600
01:08:32,526 --> 01:08:34,803
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, I know.

601
01:08:34,903 --> 01:08:36,697
It's an old house.

602
01:08:47,333 --> 01:08:49,001
WOW!

603
01:08:51,045 --> 01:08:55,574
- Jesus! What a place!
- This is really fabulous.

604
01:08:55,674 --> 01:08:57,826
Oh Patty, check this out.

605
01:08:57,926 --> 01:09:00,204
- What a beautiful room.
- What is this?

606
01:09:00,304 --> 01:09:03,974
- I'll put the beer in the kitchen.
- Look at the stuff in the dining room.

607
01:09:04,433 --> 01:09:06,310
Oh my God.

608
01:09:06,852 --> 01:09:09,412
- Oh, to live in a place like this.
- This is an incredible room.

609
01:09:09,813 --> 01:09:11,565
Hey...

610
01:09:16,862 --> 01:09:19,907
Suzanne, this is really weird.

611
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:39,635
You like that?

612
01:09:40,511 --> 01:09:42,496
Oh... Oh yeah.

613
01:09:42,596 --> 01:09:45,933
Oh yeah. This kind of stuff
is fabulous. I love it.

614
01:09:47,101 --> 01:09:50,771
Well, come with me. I'll show you
something that's really nice.

615
01:10:09,248 --> 01:10:12,918
Oh boy, do you need a paint job.

616
01:10:37,276 --> 01:10:38,944
Father Gerritty!

617
01:10:39,778 --> 01:10:41,513
- Father Gerr...
- What's the trouble?

618
01:10:41,613 --> 01:10:45,017
Listen, Father Gerritty, my name is Bobby
Tuttle, I'm a friend of Donny Kohler's.

619
01:10:45,117 --> 01:10:47,811
He's in a lot of trouble, Father.
He's gone crazy.

620
01:10:47,911 --> 01:10:49,791
- Well, come in.
- No, no, no, there isn't time.

621
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:52,816
He's really flipped out and this guy is
after him and wants to kill him.

622
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:55,903
'Cause Donny attacked his sister
and her face is...

623
01:10:56,003 --> 01:10:58,155
Father, he's gone crazy and
I don't know what to do.

624
01:10:58,255 --> 01:10:59,990
I didn't know whether to go
to the police or what,

625
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:02,493
so would you come with me over to his
house? You know how to talk to him.

626
01:11:02,593 --> 01:11:04,578
Will you please come an help me?
Will you please?

627
01:11:04,678 --> 01:11:06,246
- He needs help. Please!
- All right.

628
01:11:06,346 --> 01:11:10,058
- All right, just a minute. I'll come
with you. - Okay, hurry. Please. Please.

629
01:11:21,487 --> 01:11:23,639
Suzanne, come here.

630
01:11:23,739 --> 01:11:26,825
You got to see this.
Come here.

631
01:11:29,828 --> 01:11:32,039
You got to see this in here.

632
01:11:32,372 --> 01:11:34,041
Suzanne.

633
01:11:35,709 --> 01:11:37,336
Suzanne?

634
01:11:40,589 --> 01:11:42,174
Suzanne?

635
01:11:43,258 --> 01:11:44,927
Suzanne.

636
01:11:49,014 --> 01:11:50,641
Suzanne.

637
01:11:54,102 --> 01:11:55,379
Suzanne.

638
01:11:55,479 --> 01:11:57,731
Are you up there, Suzanne?

639
01:12:25,926 --> 01:12:27,719
You there?

640
01:12:28,637 --> 01:12:31,598
Suzanne, will you cut it out.

641
01:12:40,190 --> 01:12:43,277
Suzanne?

642
01:12:44,111 --> 01:12:45,779
Oh God!

643
01:13:02,254 --> 01:13:04,298
I tried being nice.

644
01:13:05,716 --> 01:13:08,093
But every one of you took advantage.

645
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,225
Now

646
01:13:19,938 --> 01:13:22,608
you're going to have
to pay the price.

647
01:13:40,292 --> 01:13:41,835
Donny!

648
01:13:43,211 --> 01:13:45,422
Hey, Donny!

649
01:13:50,218 --> 01:13:54,264
Donny. Mrs. Kohler.
It's Father Gerritty.

650
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:03,774
Hey, his truck is right over there.
He's here. He's here.

651
01:14:13,033 --> 01:14:15,644
Hey Donny, come on, man.

652
01:14:15,744 --> 01:14:18,981
That girl's brother is after you.
We're just trying to help you.

653
01:14:19,081 --> 01:14:20,499
Come on!

654
01:14:35,806 --> 01:14:37,516
Help!

655
01:14:57,369 --> 01:14:59,579
Holy Christ!

656
01:15:09,464 --> 01:15:11,216
Are you all right?

657
01:15:11,466 --> 01:15:13,301
Yeah, I'm okay.

658
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:22,519
It's all right. It's okay.

659
01:15:41,955 --> 01:15:43,623
Are you all right?

660
01:15:58,138 --> 01:15:59,723
Donny?

661
01:16:00,348 --> 01:16:01,958
Mrs. Kohler.

662
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:03,935
It's Father Gerritty.

663
01:16:19,826 --> 01:16:22,788
I did what you said
and it didn't work.

664
01:16:23,121 --> 01:16:25,081
You lied to me!

665
01:16:37,385 --> 01:16:38,762
Oh my God!

666
01:16:39,971 --> 01:16:42,724
It's all right.

667
01:16:42,974 --> 01:16:44,434
It's all right.

668
01:17:00,826 --> 01:17:05,080
<i>(He lied to you. He lied to you.
Now you've got to hide.)</i>

669
01:17:06,289 --> 01:17:09,668
<i>(Hide. They're all liars. Liars.)</i>

670
01:17:11,002 --> 01:17:13,255
A fine lot of thanks I get.

671
01:17:13,797 --> 01:17:18,426
I bring you into my home.
I give you love and shelter,

672
01:17:19,135 --> 01:17:21,263
better than any of you ever had.

673
01:17:21,972 --> 01:17:23,932
And you turn on me.

674
01:17:24,599 --> 01:17:26,643
I still let you stay.

675
01:17:29,354 --> 01:17:31,064
Well,

676
01:17:34,442 --> 01:17:35,944
no more.

677
01:17:36,194 --> 01:17:38,071
We hate you, Donny.

678
01:17:38,446 --> 01:17:41,074
- What?
- We hate you.

679
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,314
We always hated you.

680
01:17:47,414 --> 01:17:49,583
We don't forgive you.

681
01:17:50,792 --> 01:17:55,547
We want to be free.
We will be free. We will be free.

682
01:18:04,973 --> 01:18:08,877
<i>(Donny, you've gone too far, you've
done it now. You told the priest.)</i>

683
01:18:08,977 --> 01:18:11,588
<i>(You shouldn't have told the priest.
The priest shouldn't know.)</i>

684
01:18:11,688 --> 01:18:13,840
<i>(You lied. Donny, you lied.)</i>

685
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:16,885
<i>(You lied to us. We hate liars.)</i>

686
01:18:16,985 --> 01:18:18,678
<i>(You lose. You did it.)</i>

687
01:18:18,778 --> 01:18:21,723
<i>(You're not the master.
You're not the master anymore.)</i>

688
01:18:21,823 --> 01:18:24,935
<i>(We'll find a new master.
We'll find a better master.)</i>

689
01:18:25,035 --> 01:18:27,203
<i>(You're finished.
You lost.)</i>

690
01:18:45,805 --> 01:18:48,224
I will never forgive you, Donald!

691
01:18:56,107 --> 01:19:00,428
<i>And this is all that remained of the
Kohler house which burned down last night.</i>

692
01:19:00,528 --> 01:19:03,890
<i>- Firefighters uncovered 5 bodies...
- Michael, I've told you to turn off that TV</i>

693
01:19:03,990 --> 01:19:05,851
and get upstairs and
clean your room.

694
01:19:05,951 --> 01:19:08,854
<i>Authorities have labeled
the fire suspicious.</i>

695
01:19:08,954 --> 01:19:10,689
Michael, did you hear what I said?

696
01:19:10,789 --> 01:19:14,292
I said to get upstairs
and clean your room.

697
01:19:16,836 --> 01:19:20,365
Michael. Michael, turn off the TV!

698
01:19:20,465 --> 01:19:25,428
Don't you ever ignore me.
Don't you disobey me. How dare you.

699
01:19:25,971 --> 01:19:30,058
I am your mother.
Don't you ever ignore me.

700
01:19:33,228 --> 01:19:35,630
<i>(Michael. Michael.)</i>

701
01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:38,508
<i>(Don't worry, Michael.
We're here now.)</i>

702
01:19:38,608 --> 01:19:40,260
<i>(We're here to help you.)</i>

703

<i>(We'll help you, Michael,
we'll help you.)</i>

here with you now.)</i>
