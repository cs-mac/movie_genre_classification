00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,150

No wants or warrants, unit 32.

7
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,287
Unit 32, Dispatch.

8
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,745
I'll be giving her a
verbal warning, 10-4.

9
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,622
No warning ticket, 32?

10
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,667
Uh-uh, too young, too cute.

11
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,298
Ha ha, 10-4, 32.

12
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:53,178
Dispatch, Unit 16,
non-injury accident

13
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:54,224
involving two cars
at intersection...

14
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,677
I'm not gonna give
you a ticket, miss.

15
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,935
Just make sure you
fix that tail light

16
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,641
first thing in
the morning, okay?

17
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,226
I will, officer.

18
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,107
Thank you.

19
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,282
Dispatch, Unit 12, 10
minute personal, Roger.

20
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,949
Dispatch, Unit 32.

21
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,696
Dispatch, Unit 32, please.

22
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,249
Dispatch, 32, come in.

23
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,403
Come on, you 911375-

24
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:14,402
Dennis, I have told you
four times, time for bed.

25
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:15,323
Say good night.

26
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:16,525
Good night princess, sleep well.

27
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,781
Dennis, you heard
your mom, let's go.

28
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:19,486
Come on.

29
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,617
Mommy, I like
to stay downstairs.

30
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:25,167
We'll see.

31
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,164
Good evening.

32
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,216
Tonight's top story is
William Henry Glazer.

33
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,009
With an update, Maureen.

34
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,712
The Los Angeles
Sheriffs Department

35
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,422
continues in its search tonight

36
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,223
for escaped mental
institution patient,

37
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,017
William Henry Glazer,
formerly of Chatsworth.

38
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,346
Glazer is wanted for
questioning in connection with

39
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,477
the so-called canyon slayings,

40
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,479
the home break-ins and
brutal knife slayings

41
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,902
of five separate Los Angeles
Canyon area residents...

42
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,649
Do you know where that other
carton of cigarettes went?

43
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,527
Glazer, here, is
25 years of age,

44
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,950
just under six feet
tall, and heavily built.

45
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,573
When last seen, he was
wearing a light beard.

46
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,031
Anyone seeing a man
matching this description

47
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,537
is asked to call the Los
Angeles Sheriff's Department

48
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,119
at 654-1654.

49
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,251
That's 654-1654.

50
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:15,049
Citizens are warned not
to try apprehending Glazer

51
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,850
on their own as he is
thought to be armed

52
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,679
and extremely dangerous.

53
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,803
In other news from
around the south land today,

54
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,889
a man believed responsible
for 100 downtown burglaries

55
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,516
was arrested by city police
today in Los Angeles.

56
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,691
Is it getting worse
every day, or is it just me?

57
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,648
I don't think it's just you.

58
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,023
Do you need anything
from the store?

59
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,447
You kidding?
It's after 11:00.

60
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:39,728
Can't it wait till morning?

61
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,405
Well we need some
milk for breakfast

62
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,362
and I'm out of cigarettes.

63
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,570
I'll be right back.

64
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:47,241
Come on Lise, there's a
nut out there somewhere.

65
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,826
Why don't you just forget it?

66
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:49,830
Forget about it.

67
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,083
I'll be gone 10 minutes.

68
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,756
He isn't out there attacking cars.
For goodness sakes.

69
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,458
No, absolutely not.

70
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,213
You are not going
out for cigarettes.

71
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,135
Oh, come on.

72
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,178
You're not going
out for cigarettes.

73
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,778
- You're a slave to them.
- Phillip.

74
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,307
I mean it Lise,
you're not going.

75
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,385
This is driving me crazy.

76
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,721
Well then give
the damn things up.

77
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:43,175
Daddy, I can't sleep.

78
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,428
Well, you little phony,
of course you can't sleep.

79
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:46,428
You're kneeling on your pillow.

80
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,226
Get under the covers, come on.

81
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,894
That's a girl.
Now close your eyes.

82
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,642
You can't sleep with them open.

83
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,227
All right, I'm gonna
sit right here till

84
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,431
you get to sleep.

85
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:55,716
I don't want to see you blink.

86
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,560
Get down, get down from there.

87
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,764
Hey!

88
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,858
Get away. Get Away.

89
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:41,154
Get down, hey
come on down.

90
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:44,149
Oh, oh I'm sorry
Lisa, I'm sorry.

91
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,609
I shouldn't have him
off the leash like this

92
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,819
but we were walking
around the neighborhood.

93
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,948
You know, that nut is
loose in Topanga somewhere.

94
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,080
Really?

95
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:52,521
Yeah, it was just on the radio.

96
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,255
A sheriff's deputy got
slashed all to hell

97
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,325
down in Malibu.

98
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,127
Wow.

99
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,567
And the guy who did it ran up in

100
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,213
the hills somewhere.

101
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,924
You know you, you really
shouldn't have to go out

102
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,797
tonight if you don't have to.

103
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,674
Oh, I'm just going to the store.

104
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,596
Yeah, well why
don't you send Phil?

105
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,432
Well, I'd rather leave
him with the kids, thanks.

106
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:10,758
Yeah, I can see your point.

107
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:11,763
All right, but be careful, huh.

108
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:12,968
Okay, night Norman.

109
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,308
Goodnight.

110
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,909
Lisa, you know if
I finish that drywall

111
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,110
tomorrow we should
be able to get the

112
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,616
guest bedroom painted by...

113
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,199
Lisa.

114
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:40,454
Lisa!

115
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,381
The 33-year-old
highway patrolman

116
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,550
was taken to Malibu
Emergency Hospital

117
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,271
with multiple knife
wounds to the upper

118
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,503
chest and face.

119
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,510
Hospital spokesman
say he is in surgery

120
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,074
at this moment and
declined to list

121
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,266
his condition.

122
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,747
Phillip's assailant
may have been

123
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,100
William Henry
Glazier, the escaped

124
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,476
mental patient.

125
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,102
He is wanted in connection
with the grizzly

126
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,230
knife slayings of five
Los Angeles Canyon

127
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,777
residents in recent weeks.

128
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,570
Witnesses to the
assault say the man

129
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,569
matching Glazier's
description was wearing

130
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,571
grey institutional
type work clothes

131
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,494
and escaped into the
Topanga Foothills.

132
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,571
The same foothills where
sheriff's department

133
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,657
officials are now
conducting an intense

134
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,367
foot and helicopter search.

135
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,576
KF...

136
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,645
All right, I sure need a ride.

137
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,192
Hey wait, wait!

138
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,313
What the hell are you doing?

139
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,112
Uh, carton of
Metropolitans please.

140
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,492
Metropolitans.

141
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,322
Regulars or longs?

142
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,782
Regular.

143
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:42,790
Did you hear about
that highway patrolman

144
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:43,745
getting stabbed up here?

145
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,000
Yeah, terrible.

146
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:48,550
Yeah, just down the road.

147
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,468
Should have seen
those cop cars boy.

148
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,638
I'll tell you, those
guys come down real fast

149
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:54,680
when it's one of their own.

150
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,758
Well, I don't envy
you having to work here

151
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,388
alone all night.

152
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,314
I'm not alone.

153
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,861
Yeah, well, I don't like guns.

154
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,404
Miss?

155
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,870
$11.39.

156
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:22,959
Oh, sorry, keep the change.

157
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,077
Thanks.

158
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,523
Damn it.

159
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,121
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

160
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,516
Damn it.

161
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:14,696
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid.

162
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,555
Oh.

163
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,121
Want gas?

164
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,128

Insert coin.

332
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:10,085
Totally awesome, all right.

333
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,583
I don't even think
level 13 exists.

334
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:14,130
Yeah it does.

335

Hey, later, man.

337

Hey, come on J.J., it's closing time.

Hey, where you guys going?

Hey, come on back.

world out there.

- You like girls, J.J.?
- I'm feeling hot man.

363
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:39,153
Come on, I'm feeling really hot.

364
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,925
Come on, lets go, lets go.

365

Plug it back in, man, I mean it.

368
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,301
Hey, Cooney.

369
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:47,682
Now we've been
through this before.

370
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,810
Now, tomorrow's another day.
All right?

371
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:54,056
I'm your best customer, Willie.

372
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,521
You shouldn't
treat me like that.

373
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,352
- I'm gonna get back at you.
- Go home, Cooney.

374
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,904
I promise you that, man.
I'm gonna get back at you.

375
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:02,188
Good. Bye.

How do you expect to
improve your grades

380

your time playing those

Oh no, forget it J.J.
As of now, you're grounded.

383
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:18,505
From now on, the game room
is off limits, period.

384
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:19,831
Come on, Dad,
be a sport, will ya?

385
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,508
Short? Sport?

386
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:22,834
Take a look at this
report card and tell me;

387

388

Forget it, J.J.

389
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:28,716
- Dad, I got a deal for you.
- No deals, end of discussion.

390
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:29,720
You're grounded.

391
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,097
Grounded?

392
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:32,348
Are you kidding me?

393
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,020
No, I'm not kidding you.

394
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:36,349
Dad, I am at my
absolute peak right now.

Oh, come on.

I am this close.

397
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:40,481

You're what, close to what?

400
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:45,907
The 13th level in The
Bishop of Battle.

401
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,780
Oh J.J., that is just a game.

402
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:48,985
It's not just a game.

403
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:50,194
It is just a game.

404
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:51,454
If I don't make it now, I
might never make it at all.

405
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:53,578
J.J., it's time you
went in your room.

406
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:55,830
No, it's not worth it.

407
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:57,539
Listen to me, Dad.

408
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:58,495
I listened long enough.

409
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,205
No you haven't.
Hear me out.

410

Now look, give me a
week, a couple days even.

- Come on, come on...

414
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:10,098
I've heard this all before.

415
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,299
Why don't you
listen to me for once?

416
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:12,054
I've listened
to you long enough.

417

No, you haven't.

418

There's gonna be no more,
no more stealing quarters.

419

No more late nights
at the arcade.

420
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:19,604
- No more any of that.
- Enough.

421
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:21,168
I've heard enough.
Go to your room.

422
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:21,935
- No.
- Yes.

423
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:22,814
- Go to your room.
- Why?

424

You always said that...

425
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:26,068
You sit there in that chair

494
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,135
I doubt he'd go there
if he was running

495
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:51,087
away, though-

496
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,217
- Lets go.
- Come on, gel: in the car.

497
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:53,421
Get in.

498
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,841
Let's get the key in the door.

499
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:57,017
All right, all
right, I'm opening it.

500
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,220
Oh, it's still closed.

501
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:01,519
Hey Willie, seen J.J.?

502
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:02,723
No, not since last night, kid.

503
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:04,149
All right, I'll open it up.

504
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,523
It's like you guys have
never played before.

505
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:08,521
Where the hell could he be?

506
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,106
We got to call
the police, Jerry.

507
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,065
Lets go.

508
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:13,488
What the hell is this?

509
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:31,427
Look what they
did to the machines.

510
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,096
Damn vandals.

511
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,133
I am The Bishop of Battle.

512
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:40,892
Master of all I survey.

513
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,142
J.J.

514
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:45,941
I have 13 progressively
harder levels.

515
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:47,517
He's got you.

516
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,987
Try me if you dare.

517
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:52,190
Insert coin.

518
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:55,610
I am The Bishop of Battle.

519
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:59,243
Master of all I survey.

520
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:04,662
I have 13 progressively
harder levels.

521
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,047
Try me if you dare.

522
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:33,962
Frank.

523
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,051
Frank.

524
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:38,592
Are you all right?

525
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:40,715
Are you all right?

526
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:42,676
A nightmare.

527
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,764
What was it about?

528
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:46,016
It was horrible.

529
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,892
I'm sorry, sorry.

530
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:00,200
It's all getting too extreme.

531
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:03,329
I think maybe I should visit
my local parish priest.

532
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,834
It's almost 9:00, Frank.

533
00:47:30,306 --> 00:47:32,684
Blessed art thou among women,

534
00:47:33,142 --> 00:47:35,190
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

535
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,192
Holy Mary, mother of God,

536
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:39,398
pray for us sinners,
now and at the hour...

537
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:47,892
You are asking,
Father, why we are

538
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:49,890
given so many signs of evil

539
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:52,688
and so few signs of good.

540
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,494
I can't help but
think that the entire

541
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:58,277
concept of good and evil
may be a fallacious one,

542
00:48:58,477 --> 00:48:59,069
Your Eminence.

543
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,487
It's come to that.

544
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:12,450
God works in ways we
cannot understand.

545
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:13,409
is with him now.

546
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:16,871
He's in a better place.

547
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:45,801
You've been a good friend, Luis.

548
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:49,630
You're leaving?

549
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:51,260
Uh huh.

550
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:54,055
Where you going?

551
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:58,139
Well, I got about $78 in cash

552
00:50:58,347 --> 00:50:59,644
and a credit card
with about $100

553
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:01,191
still left on it.

554
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:03,857
I'm gonna drive until
I can't buy gas anymore

555
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:07,611
and then I'm gonna stop,
get some kind of a job.

556
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:09,692
What are you, crazy?

557
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:13,404
Come on, Frank, everybody
has a crisis of faith.

558
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:16,161
You do, I do, the Bishop does.

559
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:18,626
Even St. Thomas did.

560
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:20,453
But it doesn't mean you stop,

561
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:22,038
pick up everything and go.

562
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:25,125
I respect your belief, Luis.

563
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:28,135
Respect my lack of belief.

564
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:35,844
ls all this happening
because of that

565
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:37,177
little boy's death?

566
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:39,517
You're really not giving
me much credit, are you?

567
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:43,225
What about the
family, my friend?

568
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:44,526
You're gonna leave
them with that

569
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:46,729
pitiful excuse for a
eulogy and then just go?

570
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,152
Think.

571
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,363
Think about what that
says to them, Frank.

572
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,196
Frank, you've been
their shepherd.

573
00:51:55,404 --> 00:51:56,280
The least you can
do is wait until

574
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:58,331
their grief begins to dissipate.

575
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:03,167
Look, I don't care what
you really believe in.

576
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,838
All I know is those
people are in desperate

577
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:06,712
need of counseling.

578
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:10,132
You've become very
important to them.

579
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,679
They need you, Frank.

580
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:15,595
The well is dry.

581
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,352
What are you doing?

582
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,059
Frank, it's holy
water, it's blessed.

583
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:28,813
It's tap water and I need it.

584
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:30,982
I got a long drive
across the desert

585
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,067
and a car with no
air conditioning.

586
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,532
Adios, Luis.

587
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,534
Thank you.

588
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,863
Grocery store.

589
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:35,609
Hold up.

590
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:36,814
What?

591
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:38,659
They shot the kid.
They want the last rights.

592
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:39,859
Get an ambulance.

593
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:40,781
He's gone, Frank.

594
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:41,782
Get an ambulance.

595
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:42,704
<i>He's gone.</i>

596
00:54:42,905 --> 00:54:44,248
Get an ambulance.

597
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:49,665
Sit down, it's gonna
be all right, sit down.

598
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:06,868
I see only anarchy.

599
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:10,076
I see inexplicable,
unfathomable anarchy.

600
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:12,036
And I see people
ground up in the gears

601
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:13,496
of this anarchy.

602
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:15,547
I see people in anguish.

603
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:22,718
My biggest fear
is this is not the

604
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:24,298
work of the devil
because there can

605
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:27,635
be no devil if there is no God.

606
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:29,436
And if there were
an Almighty God,

607
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:32,727
he would never allow
such suffering.

608
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:35,768
I've come to believe
that we are living

609
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:38,650
in a great void, Your Eminence.

610
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,068
I've lost my faith.

611
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:10,070
What is it you want?

612
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,578
What is it you want?

613
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:40,099
No!

614
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:47,269
No!

615
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:22,469
There's no tracks
in that sand anywhere.

616
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,723
There's no strange
paint in those dents

617
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:27,349
on your car.

618
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:29,348
Nah, there's just no evidence of

619
01:03:29,556 --> 01:03:31,354
another vehicle
around here anywhere.

620
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:36,479
You think I'm making this up?

621
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:40,534
No sir, uh, I think
that maybe you fell

622
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:42,862
asleep and went off the road.

623
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:45,913
Your car rolled over
and you got thrown out.

624
01:03:46,114 --> 01:03:48,116
They say you got
a mild concussion.

625
01:03:48,325 --> 01:03:50,828
I had one of them once myself.

626
01:03:51,036 --> 01:03:53,164
Gave me the weirdest
dreams, like you.

627
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:58,883
You know, Father, in
the history of the church

628
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:02,423
only a few, very few
individuals have been

629
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:06,601
given a literal
sign, as at Lourdes.

630
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:08,269
That's why the word is faith.

631
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:09,470
You understand?

632
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,807
: Well, we're right
smack dab between

633
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:14,393
that hospital up in
Bisbee and Travis General

634
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:16,069
where you're coming from.

635
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:19,698
I'll have that driver just
take you on up to Bisbee.

636
01:04:19,898 --> 01:04:21,866
No wait, wait...

637
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:27,489
Take me to Travis.

638
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:30,125
Now you did tell me
you were leaving there,

639
01:04:30,325 --> 01:04:31,577
didn't ya?

640
01:04:33,078 --> 01:04:35,331
That's where my parish is.

641
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:39,459
Yes sir, it's all right with me.

642
01:04:45,507 --> 01:04:46,759
Travis.

643
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:14,288
Steven?

644
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:15,490
Huh?

645
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:17,282
Steven?

646
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:18,325
What?

647
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:20,127
I heard it again.

648
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:23,506
Can rats get in
between the walls?

649
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:25,208
It's not rats.

650
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:27,259
It's the wind.

651
01:07:28,336 --> 01:07:30,338
The branches need a trimming.

652
01:07:30,547 --> 01:07:31,799
Go to sleep.

653
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:51,822
Just turn off the
violins, will ya, Bill?

654
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:53,152
This isn't the first
time this son of a...

655
01:07:53,361 --> 01:07:55,489
the nitwit screwed up.

656
01:07:57,865 --> 01:07:59,663
So his wife's expecting.

657
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:00,867
It isn't the issue.

658
01:08:00,994 --> 01:08:02,621
The man's an employee,
he works for us.

659
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:03,876
He represents us.

660
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:05,540
I'll be damned if I'm gonna
let him embarrass us again.

661
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:06,416
Mommy.

662
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:07,744
We're on the line here, too.

663
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:12,681
What's pryidoxine hydrochloride?

664
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,006
God knows.

665
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:15,262
No notice...

666
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:16,467
- Am I eating it?
- Just give him two weeks severance

667
01:08:16,676 --> 01:08:17,768
and get him out.

668
01:08:17,969 --> 01:08:19,221
Look Bill, I'll be in
in a half an hour.

669
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:20,555
I want Higgins gone.

670
01:08:21,848 --> 01:08:22,848
Jim Higgins.

671
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:24,393
You don't know
anything about this, Claire,

672
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:25,601
so don't start.

673
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:28,275
Jim used to be
your best salesman.

674
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,357
You know, Nancy's pregnant.

675
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:32,491
What's this with
the exterminator?

676
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:34,702
What's all this about?

677
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:36,449
We have rats.

678
01:08:36,738 --> 01:08:38,658
I heard them in the walls
and later in the attic.

679
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:39,619
You didn't wake up.

680
01:08:39,824 --> 01:08:40,916
Are they white ones?

681
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:42,790
Just go out and
buy a couple of traps.

682
01:08:42,994 --> 01:08:44,996
I'll set them up tonight
and that'll be it.

683
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:46,501
Well, I just
figured you wouldn't

684
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:48,253
want to be bothered
with setting traps.

685
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:50,218
Look, we still want
the swimming pool, right?

686
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:51,293
What?

687
01:08:51,336 --> 01:08:53,213
The swimming pool,
I take it we still want to put it in.

688
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:56,095
Oh yeah, Daddy, of course we do.

689
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:58,142
Well, we're going to, peanut.

690
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:01,012
But the way we're going
to is by not wasting

691
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:03,723
a lot of money on things
like cleaning ladies

692
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:07,060
twice a week and
shyster rat catchers

693
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:09,987
who come out and look for
droppings once a month.

694
01:09:10,772 --> 01:09:12,524
We did agree that certain things

695
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:13,654
we're going to start
doing around here

696
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:15,826
all by ourselves,
didn't we, Claire?

697
01:09:16,027 --> 01:09:18,121
If you catch the rat
can I keep it, Daddy?

698
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:19,823
I'll tell you what, sweetheart,

699
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:22,659
if Mommy says it's okay,
you've got yourself a deal.

700
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:24,619
Here you go.
Go get your books.

701
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:25,749
I'll wait for you in the car.

702
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:27,375
Yeah, yeah.

703
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:03,517
Oh no, honey.

704
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:06,513
You see anything?

705
01:11:06,721 --> 01:11:07,893
Insulation.

706
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:13,027
Mr. Thompson has
two rats in a cage.

707
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:14,904
Who's Mr. Thompson?

708
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:16,822
Billy Noble's teacher.

709
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:20,569
One's named Annie, the
other, he's the boy,

710
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:22,905
he's named Pinto
because he has these

711
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:24,534
little pink spots all over.

712
01:11:24,739 --> 01:11:25,739
Oh.

713
01:11:41,172 --> 01:11:43,550
Billy says Pinto is this big.

714
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:45,427
Brooke, please.

715
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:50,188
Did you do it?

716
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:52,107
Yeah, tough job.

717
01:11:52,433 --> 01:11:54,231
Took all of a minute and a half.

718
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:30,805
What's the trouble here?

719
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,017
No trouble.

720
01:12:35,643 --> 01:12:36,860
Seems like we've had this kind

721
01:12:37,061 --> 01:12:39,029
of trouble around
here for a month.

722
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:42,324
How would you know?

723
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:43,868
You're never around.

724
01:12:45,236 --> 01:12:47,955
You're either traveling
or at the office or something.

725
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,452
I'm here now.

726
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:54,454
Steven.

727
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:56,831
Steven.

728
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:02,386
Steven, you're not even here
when you're here anymore.

729
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:08,593
Do you know how
insensitive you've become?

730
01:13:10,303 --> 01:13:12,977
You use a sledgehammer
most of the time

731
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:15,023
when just a word
or two would do.

732
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:17,352
There are people
who get things clone

733
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:19,858
and there are people
who don't, Claire.

734
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:22,319
Steven.

735
01:13:33,701 --> 01:13:36,671
All our problems should
be solved so easily.

736
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:38,922
Steven, would you
please get rid of it?

737
01:13:39,123 --> 01:13:40,249
What?

738
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:42,711
Would you please get rid of it?

739
01:13:43,294 --> 01:13:44,294
Now?

740
01:13:44,462 --> 01:13:45,634
Well, I am not going
to be able to sleep

741
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:46,714
knowing it's bleeding all over us.

742
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:48,049
I am not getting dressed
and going down -

743
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:50,100
- Steven please, please.
- Absolutely.

744
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:52,645
Yes m♪am, at your service.

745
01:13:54,889 --> 01:13:58,564
Your hero humbly accepts
his thanks, by the way.

746
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:20,683
I can't find Rosie.

747
01:15:20,891 --> 01:15:22,017
What'd you say, hun?

748
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:23,603
Rosie, she's gone.

749
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:25,174
You mean she wasn't in your room

750
01:15:25,312 --> 01:15:26,108
when you woke up?

751
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:27,986
No and I'm scared.

752
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:30,284
Oh honey, she probably
just went out somewhere.

753
01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:32,282
She never just goes away.

754
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:33,954
Sometimes she does.

755
01:15:34,739 --> 01:15:35,859
Somebody got a problem here?

756
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:37,249
Rosie's gone.

757
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:39,578
Mama says she just
goes away some times.

758
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:41,503
But she doesn't.

759
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:43,706
Oh, this sink is all plugged up.

760
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:46,175
I'm afraid something's
happened to her.

761
01:15:46,834 --> 01:15:48,427
Here let me do that, hun.

762
01:15:48,627 --> 01:15:49,378
Excuse me.

763
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:51,555
Wasn't Rosie fixed?

764
01:15:51,756 --> 01:15:53,196
Yeah, she was fixed
almost a year ago

765
01:15:53,257 --> 01:15:55,680
but that doesn't mean
that she can't go out sometimes.

766
01:15:55,885 --> 01:15:58,229
She wouldn't go out for that.

767
01:15:58,429 --> 01:15:59,646
I know her.

768
01:15:59,847 --> 01:16:02,441
Rosie wouldn't go
out for that at all.

769
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:04,609
Don't worry about Rosie, peanut.

770
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:06,858
She'll be back by the time
you get home from school.

771
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:09,282
We better hurry up,
we're gonna be late.

772
01:16:15,613 --> 01:16:18,662
Oh, that's disgusting.

773
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:20,618
What is it?

774
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:23,374
Nothing to worry about.

775
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,502
Just some old rat hair.

776
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:29,051
I thought you said
it was a white rat.

777
01:16:30,753 --> 01:16:32,721
I'm surprised that
little guy wasn't bald.

778
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:40,138
Rosie.

779
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:42,647
Kitty.

780
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:45,435
Rosie.

781
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:50,030
Kitty, kitty.

782
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:54,736
Rosie, come here.

783
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:03,957
Rosie.

784
01:17:05,079 --> 01:17:06,376
Kitty.

785
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:11,259
Here, kitty kitty.

786
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:12,803
Rosie.

787
01:17:13,796 --> 01:17:15,469
Rosie?

788
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:19,681
Rosie.

789
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:21,971
Oh...

790
01:17:23,764 --> 01:17:24,890
Rosie?

791
01:17:28,561 --> 01:17:29,858
Kitty?

792
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:31,529
Rosie?

793
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:32,856
Oh great.

794
01:17:34,817 --> 01:17:35,818
Rosie.

795
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:37,949
Hi Rosie, come here.

796
01:17:38,154 --> 01:17:39,576
Rosie?

797
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,253
Come here, kitty.

798
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:49,210
Ow.

799
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:52,172
Come here, Rosie, come on.

800
01:17:53,836 --> 01:17:55,383
Won't you come here?

801
01:17:55,588 --> 01:17:56,805
Rosie?

802
01:17:59,049 --> 01:18:00,642
You all right, honey?

803
01:18:01,886 --> 01:18:03,604
Come here kitty, come here.

804
01:18:03,804 --> 01:18:05,147
What's the matter?

805
01:18:09,143 --> 01:18:10,190
Rosie?

806
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:11,862
You all right?

807
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:16,442
Baby, I'm gonna catch you.

808
01:18:17,276 --> 01:18:18,276
Oh.

809
01:18:28,746 --> 01:18:30,498
Come on, Rosie.

810
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:38,673
Oh, oh.

811
01:19:18,504 --> 01:19:19,255
Okay, bye.

812
01:19:20,256 --> 01:19:21,599
Hi honey.
You have a good day?

813
01:19:21,799 --> 01:19:22,799
Pretty good.

814
01:19:22,967 --> 01:19:24,640
Billy was lying about Pinto.

815
01:19:24,843 --> 01:19:27,813
He's only that big.

816
01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:30,273
Did Rosie come home yet?

817
01:19:32,268 --> 01:19:33,315
Did she?

818
01:19:33,519 --> 01:19:35,362
No, she didn't, honey.

819
01:19:35,562 --> 01:19:37,690
Can I go to Cindy's
after I change?

820
01:19:37,898 --> 01:19:38,899
Sure ya can.

821
01:19:39,108 --> 01:19:40,485
You have to be home
before it gets dark. All right?

822
01:19:40,693 --> 01:19:41,410
Okay.

823
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:47,533
Mommy!

824
01:19:47,866 --> 01:19:49,209
Look what Rosie did!

825
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:52,334
Honey, wait for me.

826
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:56,129
What is it, honey?

827
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:58,093
Look.

828
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:01,263
Why would Rosie do that?

829
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:04,641
What's wrong, Mommy?

830
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:10,972
Oh.

831
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:12,808
Oh my god.

832
01:20:26,989 --> 01:20:29,492
Why would Rosie do this, Mommy?

833
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:32,161
I don't know, honey.

834
01:20:38,459 --> 01:20:40,461
Choosey's okay.

835
01:20:49,553 --> 01:20:51,681
Honey, why don't we go over...

836
01:20:57,644 --> 01:20:58,395
Mommy.

837
01:20:58,604 --> 01:21:00,072
It's all right honey.
It's all right.

838
01:21:00,272 --> 01:21:02,400
Why don't we, uh, go
over to Cindy's now.

839
01:21:02,608 --> 01:21:03,609
Okay?

840
01:21:10,824 --> 01:21:12,872
The wires have
been gnawed through.

841
01:21:13,077 --> 01:21:14,704
That's what caused
the flickering light.

842
01:21:14,912 --> 01:21:18,007
But aren't wires
inside pipes or something?

843
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:21,047
Look at this.

844
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:22,920
Didn't seem to
bother this fella.

845
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:25,802
You mean it bit
straight through the pipe?

846
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:27,762
A rat can do that?

847
01:21:27,966 --> 01:21:30,810
I've seen a seven
pound rat squeeze through

848
01:21:31,011 --> 01:21:32,729
a quarter inch
crack under a door

849
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:34,603
without exhaling, Mrs. Houston.

850
01:21:34,807 --> 01:21:36,559
I've seen them living
in mud huts along

851
01:21:36,767 --> 01:21:39,691
the river like beavers
and nesting in trees

852
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:41,192
like eagles.

853
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:44,492
I've seen 'em as big as
a medium size dog

854
01:21:44,691 --> 01:21:47,035
and as small as a big June bug.

855
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:51,616
I'm no longer surprised at
anything I see a rat do.

856
01:21:51,824 --> 01:21:53,576
Very special animals.

857
01:21:54,618 --> 01:21:57,918
They're horrid
animals is what they are.

858
01:21:58,122 --> 01:21:59,499
This one is big and horrid.

859
01:21:59,706 --> 01:22:01,208
You saw him?

860
01:22:01,708 --> 01:22:03,927
Well, I saw his eyes.

861
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:06,589
He was, uh, looking at me when I

862
01:22:06,797 --> 01:22:08,344
was underneath the house.

863
01:22:08,549 --> 01:22:10,142
How long have
you been on vacation

864
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:11,342
or wherever?

865
01:22:11,885 --> 01:22:13,762
Oh, we haven't been anywhere.

866
01:22:13,971 --> 01:22:15,769
But your little
girl has been away?

867
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:18,441
No, Why?

868
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:21,566
Well it's obvious your
pest has been working

869
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:22,817
at this for several weeks.

870
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:25,612
How come you didn't
notice until today?

871
01:22:26,733 --> 01:22:30,112
Well, that wall was
perfect yesterday.

872
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,624
That happened sometime
during the night.

873
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:38,849
I think you better
show me the cabinet

874
01:22:38,954 --> 01:22:40,672
he was into downstairs.

875
01:23:00,434 --> 01:23:02,152
oh, my god.

876
01:23:02,728 --> 01:23:06,028
That, madam, was not done
by your average rodent.

877
01:23:08,066 --> 01:23:10,114
I've never seen that
kind of destruction.

878
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:13,698
Steven, look what
this thing has done.

879
01:23:13,906 --> 01:23:16,034
It's worse than we thought.

880
01:23:17,242 --> 01:23:18,744
My name is
Keefer, Mr. Houston.

881
01:23:19,119 --> 01:23:20,999
You've got an unusually
aggressive visitor, sir.

882
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:23,332
- I've never seen anything like...
- You know that it's killed Rosie

883
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:24,336
and I found her under the house.

884
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:26,009
Apparently, my
wife misunderstood me.

885
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:27,587
I was under the impression
that we agreed I was

886
01:23:27,794 --> 01:23:29,341
gonna handle this
problem by myself.

887
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:31,186
Steven you can't
handle this problem by...

888
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:33,759
How much do I
owe you Mr. Keefer?

889
01:23:33,967 --> 01:23:35,435
Well sir, you really
don't owe me anything.

890
01:23:35,636 --> 01:23:36,933
- Well then, thank you very much.
- Steven.

891
01:23:37,137 --> 01:23:38,354
I apologize for having
wasted your time.

892
01:23:38,555 --> 01:23:39,807
Steven.

893
01:23:40,349 --> 01:23:41,521
Wait a minute.

894
01:23:41,725 --> 01:23:43,272
Look, I'm not gonna
let Brooke sleep up in her room.

895
01:23:43,477 --> 01:23:44,569
Wait till you see the
damage it's done.

896
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:46,147
Then she can sleep in the
bedroom next to our room.

897
01:23:46,355 --> 01:23:48,653
Would you excuse us
please, Mr. Keefer.

898
01:24:03,205 --> 01:24:05,708
I'm terribly sorry I
bruised your precious ego.

899
01:24:05,916 --> 01:24:07,636
Get off my back, Claire.
I had a tough clay.

900
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:08,505
I had no idea it was so fragile.

901
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:09,802
We have a second rat,
I'll get rid of it.

902
01:24:10,003 --> 01:24:11,220
You know what
Mr. Keefer said?

903
01:24:11,421 --> 01:24:12,343
- He said he's never...
- You know what your problem is?

904
01:24:12,548 --> 01:24:13,390
Seen this kind of destruction.

905
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:15,217
It's the same as 99% of
the people in this world.

906
01:24:15,425 --> 01:24:16,176
Why don't we bring
in somebody who's

907
01:24:16,385 --> 01:24:17,386
see this type of damage.

908
01:24:17,594 --> 01:24:20,188
It never occurs to you
to do something yourself.

909
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,607
Will Rosie come back?

910
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:29,948
Well, you know what I think?

911
01:24:30,148 --> 01:24:31,445
I think Rosie might
have gone to visit

912
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:32,446
some friends.

913
01:24:32,651 --> 01:24:34,619
But will she ever come back?

914
01:24:36,488 --> 01:24:37,660
I don't know.

915
01:24:37,864 --> 01:24:39,787
We'll just have to wait and see.

916
01:24:40,659 --> 01:24:42,036
Now you get some sleep now.

917
01:24:42,244 --> 01:24:43,444
Tomorrow's another school day.

918
01:24:44,746 --> 01:24:45,872
Good night.

919
01:24:46,456 --> 01:24:48,299
Don't close the door.

920
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:49,592
I won't.

921
01:24:49,793 --> 01:24:50,919
Good night.

922
01:24:58,427 --> 01:25:00,395
Good night, Rosie.

923
01:25:06,643 --> 01:25:08,987
I think we should
buy Brooke another cat.

924
01:25:09,187 --> 01:25:10,689
A kitten.

925
01:25:10,897 --> 01:25:12,524
It probably would be best
to wait until we get rid of...

926
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:19,280
Hello?

927
01:25:19,448 --> 01:25:21,246
Mrs. Houston, it's Keefer.

928
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:22,201
Yes.

929
01:25:22,409 --> 01:25:24,457
The reason I'm calling
is, well, this might sound

930
01:25:24,661 --> 01:25:26,861
a little strange Mrs. Houston,
but there's this old book

931
01:25:26,913 --> 01:25:30,713
I have from back in
Germany in the 1600s.

932
01:25:30,917 --> 01:25:34,091
Tells about a thing called
the das Teufel Nagetier.

933
01:25:34,296 --> 01:25:35,548
Das what?

934
01:25:35,756 --> 01:25:37,383
Claire, who is it?

935
01:25:37,591 --> 01:25:39,434
Das Teufel Nagetier.

936
01:25:39,843 --> 01:25:42,392
I was going to tell
you about it today

937
01:25:42,596 --> 01:25:44,598
but Mr. Houston didn't seem much
in the mood for listening.

938
01:25:44,931 --> 01:25:46,478
Who is that?
It's late.

939
01:25:47,726 --> 01:25:51,902
Well, what is this Das
Teufel, whatever it is?

940
01:25:52,105 --> 01:25:54,858
It translates into
“the devil rodent".

941
01:25:55,359 --> 01:25:57,487
It's a legend about
huge malevolent rodents

942
01:25:57,694 --> 01:25:59,321
with unbelievable
cunning and strength

943
01:25:59,529 --> 01:26:02,499
that terrorize certain
villainous individuals

944
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:03,699
in 17th Century Europe.

945
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:05,543
Claire, who are you talking to?

946
01:26:05,744 --> 01:26:07,917
The problem is
according to the legend

947
01:26:08,205 --> 01:26:12,426
Das Teufel Nagetier cannot
be destroyed, Mrs. Houston.

948
01:26:12,751 --> 01:26:14,128
That's ridiculous.

949
01:26:14,336 --> 01:26:15,883
Claire, who the hell is...

950
01:26:16,755 --> 01:26:17,755
Who is this?

951
01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:19,258
It's Keefer, Mr. Houston.

952
01:26:19,633 --> 01:26:20,930
The reason I called
before is that I think

953
01:26:21,134 --> 01:26:23,262
the problem over there may
be bigger than you realize.

954
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:25,313
What in hell are
you talking about?

955
01:26:25,514 --> 01:26:27,016
We have rats.

956
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:28,433
I'll take care of them.

957
01:26:28,642 --> 01:26:29,642
You won't.

958
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:31,687
Don't call again.

959
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:46,160
Everybody's got
their hand out Claire

960
01:26:46,368 --> 01:26:48,962
and you're always
right there to fill it.

961
01:26:51,415 --> 01:26:52,792
He told me an awful story.

962
01:26:52,999 --> 01:26:54,717
Of course he did,
to scare you into

963
01:26:54,918 --> 01:26:56,636
rehiring him.

964
01:27:00,716 --> 01:27:02,013
Steven?

965
01:27:20,694 --> 01:27:22,196
Steven.

966
01:27:22,404 --> 01:27:25,032
Mommy, Daddy, I'm scared.

967
01:27:27,576 --> 01:27:28,623
Brooke.

968
01:27:28,827 --> 01:27:29,578
Mommy!

969
01:27:29,786 --> 01:27:31,163
Brooke!

970
01:27:36,001 --> 01:27:37,719
Brooke.

971
01:27:38,962 --> 01:27:41,010
Are you all right, sweetheart?

972
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:45,765
Honey, honey, oh God.

973
01:27:47,053 --> 01:27:48,053
Are you okay?

974
01:27:55,437 --> 01:27:56,529
What is going on?

975
01:27:56,730 --> 01:27:58,152
Oh God!

976
01:27:58,356 --> 01:27:59,356
Mommy.

977
01:28:00,025 --> 01:28:01,823
What is happening here?

978
01:28:04,446 --> 01:28:05,789
Steven?

979
01:28:05,989 --> 01:28:07,206
Come on, honey.

980
01:28:47,989 --> 01:28:49,115
Steven?

981
01:28:49,366 --> 01:28:50,709
Mommy!

982
01:28:50,909 --> 01:28:52,549
It's all right honey,
you just stay right,

983
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:53,669
I'm just gonna close the,

984
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:55,338
I'm just gonna close the door.

985
01:28:55,539 --> 01:28:56,540
Okay?

986
01:28:56,748 --> 01:28:57,795
See?

987
01:29:05,924 --> 01:29:06,641
There.

988
01:29:06,842 --> 01:29:07,842
Okay?

989
01:29:08,426 --> 01:29:10,303
Mommy!

990
01:29:10,887 --> 01:29:13,436
Oh honey, it's
all right, sweetheart.

991
01:29:13,974 --> 01:29:15,851
They'll go back on.

992
01:29:16,059 --> 01:29:17,561
They will, I know.

993
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:47,140
Rosie, see, see,
they went back on.

994
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:49,100
Now we'll just stay
right here and everything

995
01:29:49,259 --> 01:29:50,010
will be just fine.

996
01:29:50,218 --> 01:29:51,218
All right?

997
01:30:44,773 --> 01:30:46,571
Steven!

998
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:50,328
Steven!

999
01:30:56,493 --> 01:30:58,086
Steven!

1000
01:30:58,286 --> 01:30:59,663
Steven!

1001
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:01,373
What are you doing?

1002
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:06,344
Steven, Steven,
you can't kill it.

1003
01:31:06,544 --> 01:31:08,296
What are you talking about?

1004
01:31:08,505 --> 01:31:09,597
Mommy, Daddy!

1005
01:31:09,798 --> 01:31:11,471
He's in the ceiling!

1006
01:31:15,553 --> 01:31:18,727
Honey, it's all right baby.

1007
01:31:24,396 --> 01:31:27,149
Here, stay here.

1008
01:31:29,109 --> 01:31:30,201
Steven!

1009
01:31:30,402 --> 01:31:31,870
You can't kill it!

1010
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:34,038
You can't kill it!

1011
01:31:38,118 --> 01:31:39,495
Steven!

1012
01:31:48,253 --> 01:31:50,881
Steven!
You're gonna kill us!

1013
01:31:52,298 --> 01:31:53,550
Steven!

1014
01:31:53,758 --> 01:31:54,758
Steven!

1015
01:31:54,884 --> 01:31:55,884
You're gonna kill...

1016
01:32:01,307 --> 01:32:02,684
Mommy!

1017
01:32:04,019 --> 01:32:05,111
Brooke, open the door!

1018
01:32:05,311 --> 01:32:06,528
What?

1019
01:32:07,772 --> 01:32:11,072
Come on baby,
honey, open the door.

1020
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:14,408
It's Daddy, open the door!

1021
01:32:16,990 --> 01:32:17,990
Brooke, open the door.

1022
01:32:18,158 --> 01:32:18,784
Watch out.

1023
01:32:18,992 --> 01:32:19,663
No!

1024
01:32:19,868 --> 01:32:21,040
You'll kill her.

1025
01:32:21,244 --> 01:32:22,245
Watch out!

1026
01:32:25,749 --> 01:32:27,046
Mommy!

1027
01:32:36,342 --> 01:32:38,436
Help me!

1028
01:32:38,636 --> 01:32:39,636
Steven!

1029
01:32:39,804 --> 01:32:41,522
Mommy!

1030
01:32:47,937 --> 01:32:49,610
Mommy!

1031
01:32:50,190 --> 01:32:51,908
Mommy!

1032
01:32:57,113 --> 01:32:58,740
Mommy!

1033
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:06,164
No, wait, you're
going to kill her.

1034
01:33:12,378 --> 01:33:15,177
I think it's trying
to tell me something.

1035
01:33:15,381 --> 01:33:16,598
What honey?

1036
01:33:17,634 --> 01:33:20,604
What, what's the
rat gonna tell you?

1037
01:33:21,096 --> 01:33:22,848
Bring baby...

1038
01:33:23,056 --> 01:33:24,273
Bring baby.

1039
01:33:24,474 --> 01:33:25,726
Hers.

1040
01:33:25,934 --> 01:33:27,607
Bring her baby back to her.

1041
01:33:27,811 --> 01:33:28,811
Oh.

1042
01:33:34,943 --> 01:33:37,992
Mommy, Mommy!

1043
01:33:38,696 --> 01:33:40,744
Bring it back to her.

1044
01:35:02,447 --> 01:35:04,575
No Daddy, please.

1045
01:35:04,866 --> 01:35:08,040
Please Daddy, she
just wanted her baby.

1046
01:35:10,914 --> 01:35:12,541
Please, Daddy.

1047
01:36:02,715 --> 01:36:05,059
Mommy, Daddy.

1048
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:17,781
Daddy, where do you
suppose she's going next?
