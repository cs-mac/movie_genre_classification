1
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,490
Honey?

2
00:02:15,415 --> 00:02:18,084
- Frank?
- What's the matter, he kicking again?

3
00:02:18,461 --> 00:02:20,785
No, it's time.

4
00:02:30,556 --> 00:02:32,880
You always make me feel so...

5
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:34,132
Frank!

6
00:02:36,977 --> 00:02:39,516
- You're awful.
- All right, let's get ready, huh?

7
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,847
- Okay.
- Okay.

8
00:02:46,697 --> 00:02:48,404
Ah.

9
00:02:53,037 --> 00:02:54,579
Ah.

10
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,956
Frank?

11
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,380
Oh, honey,
you better go wake up Chris.

12
00:03:13,431 --> 00:03:14,927
Chris.

13
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:38,663
Come on, I got your number.

14
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,161
Come on.

15
00:03:40,332 --> 00:03:41,958
Thattaboy.

16
00:03:42,127 --> 00:03:45,163
- Dad, what time is it?
- What time is it? Time to get up.

17
00:03:45,463 --> 00:03:49,793
I have to drop you off at Charley's house.
You have to go to school from there.

18
00:03:49,968 --> 00:03:51,508
- Why?
- Well, I wonder why.

19
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:53,506
- I don't know.
- "I don't know."

20
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:58,177
- Oh, is Mom having the baby?
- Yes. A trick she does every 11 years.

21
00:03:58,352 --> 00:04:00,925
- I guess so.
- Why don't you get dressed...

22
00:04:01,104 --> 00:04:03,512
...and don't forget your books.
- Okay.

23
00:04:03,691 --> 00:04:05,185
- Dad?
- Yeah?

24
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,481
Anything happen to her? I saw on TV
in a movie once, where the mother died.

25
00:04:09,695 --> 00:04:11,652
Well, you know something?

26
00:04:12,157 --> 00:04:15,490
Things like that
happened a long time ago.

27
00:04:15,661 --> 00:04:17,368
They don't happen that way anymore.

28
00:04:17,535 --> 00:04:19,031
- She had you, didn't she?
- Yeah.

29
00:04:19,206 --> 00:04:21,612
Yeah, look at the size of you,
you big ox.

30
00:04:23,586 --> 00:04:29,042
Okay, now, here you go.
Let's get ready. Attaboy.

31
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,975
Why can't I go with you
to the hospital?

32
00:04:49,361 --> 00:04:54,187
We'd love to have you, but the doctors
don't allow little boys in hospitals.

33
00:04:54,365 --> 00:04:56,606
If I have my tonsils out again
I can go there.

34
00:04:56,827 --> 00:05:00,076
You'd be there for a week
and we'd be home in three days.

35
00:05:00,245 --> 00:05:04,575
You young whippersnappers.
You're not like the old team.

36
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:08,742
Old Mister dancing out on the plains
and prairie, driving those cattle...

37
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:12,539
...getting their tonsils out in the middle
of the night, no doctors.

38
00:05:12,717 --> 00:05:16,582
Oh, boy. You're not a chip off
the old block there, Scout.

39
00:05:18,014 --> 00:05:20,586
Well, maybe Charley
won't like having me around.

40
00:05:20,765 --> 00:05:23,258
Charley won't like having you around.

41
00:05:23,437 --> 00:05:28,016
Charley only sees his own boys two
Sundays a month and he loves kids.

42
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:33,433
Now, you young whippersnapper,
kiss your mother goodbye.

43
00:05:33,612 --> 00:05:36,696
Listen, we'll give you a call
as soon as we find out...

44
00:05:36,866 --> 00:05:39,536
...whether you've got
a baby sister or a brother.

45
00:05:39,702 --> 00:05:43,535
I don't care, as long as you're okay.
And you give me one of the puppies.

46
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,117
Charley!

47
00:05:54,926 --> 00:05:57,132
Honey, your book.

48
00:05:57,303 --> 00:06:00,054
- Hi, Charley!
- Lenore, good luck to you.

49
00:06:00,222 --> 00:06:03,556
Call me, Frank. Call me.

50
00:06:09,398 --> 00:06:12,564
Well, pal, let's go and whip up
some French toast.

51
00:06:23,953 --> 00:06:26,492
I'm having my baby.

52
00:06:43,808 --> 00:06:46,512
Nurse, you know what they call them?

53
00:06:46,726 --> 00:06:51,932
In Ireland, my mother used to call them
the "wee cuddies" and the "wee cubs."

54
00:06:52,106 --> 00:06:54,858
The wee cuddies and wee...
Where could you get that?

55
00:06:55,068 --> 00:06:57,772
Wee cuddies and wee cubs.
I hope I have one like that.

56
00:06:57,989 --> 00:07:02,317
Would you please come to the labor
room now? It's the time to go back.

57
00:07:02,492 --> 00:07:03,822
- The labor room?
- Yes.

58
00:07:03,994 --> 00:07:05,488
- All right.
- This way.

59
00:07:13,503 --> 00:07:17,038
How did you know about
the wee cuddies and the wee cubs?

60
00:07:17,214 --> 00:07:19,292
I learned about them a long time ago.

61
00:07:19,467 --> 00:07:22,422
- You speak Gaelic? Are you Irish?
- Yes. No, Scottish.

62
00:07:22,595 --> 00:07:24,803
- Scottish? And you speak Gaelic?
- I do.

63
00:07:24,973 --> 00:07:26,930
- You do speak Gaelic?
- This way.

64
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:30,221
An Irish and a Gaelic.
An Irish and a Scotsman.

65
00:07:34,481 --> 00:07:36,606
- An Irish and a Scotsman.
- Yes.

66
00:07:42,573 --> 00:07:43,901
Hang on to my hand.

67
00:07:44,075 --> 00:07:48,701
Honey, I'm not very brave.
Oh, this little guy's gonna kill me.

68
00:07:48,872 --> 00:07:51,446
- Well, maybe I'll get a doctor.
- No, no.

69
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,700
He's just different than Chris,
that's all.

70
00:07:53,876 --> 00:07:56,913
I tried to talk to the doctor
and make him understand...

71
00:07:57,089 --> 00:07:59,164
...but I couldn't make him understand.

72
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,384
It seems like it's different.
Honey, you better get the nurse.

73
00:08:03,554 --> 00:08:06,008
Nurse, hurry up, please.

74
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:11,973
- You better go to the waiting room.
- Just a minute, please. I love you.

75
00:08:13,063 --> 00:08:16,562
I'm glad. I'm glad we decided
to have the baby, aren't you?

76
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:19,058
We both want it.
Don't worry about a thing.

77
00:08:19,236 --> 00:08:22,271
It's not gonna tie you down,
is it, sweetheart?

78
00:08:22,488 --> 00:08:26,817
Are you gonna feel trapped
like you did last time? Ah! Ah!

79
00:08:26,993 --> 00:08:29,864
- Calm down. Take a deep breath.
- I am!

80
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:33,240
Take a deep breath. Calm down.

81
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:37,662
Relax. Try to relax.
Take a deep breath.

82
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:41,711
Hey, listen, have you got
something to stir the coffee with?

83
00:08:41,882 --> 00:08:45,465
Yeah, here, use that. I've been using it
for the past three hours.

84
00:08:45,637 --> 00:08:48,008
You get used
to the taste of lead in coffee.

85
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:52,055
There is an overabundance of lead
in all the things we eat nowadays.

86
00:08:52,226 --> 00:08:54,763
We're slowly but surely
poisoning ourselves.

87
00:08:55,354 --> 00:08:57,892
Fine world to bring a kid into, fellas.

88
00:08:58,066 --> 00:09:00,902
- I could cite examples...
- You don't have to lecture.

89
00:09:01,069 --> 00:09:04,152
Take a look at that smog.
What difference does it make...

90
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:07,357
...if we breathe it or eat it?
- Maybe we'll adapt to it.

91
00:09:07,534 --> 00:09:11,117
I'm an exterminator. We service
the Beverly Hills-Westwood area.

92
00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:13,487
Here. Here's my card.

93
00:09:14,665 --> 00:09:17,750
I'm not trying to drum up business
or anything. No.

94
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:21,787
The point is, years back, we developed
this spray to kill roaches...

95
00:09:22,007 --> 00:09:23,630
...and other household pests.

96
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:27,299
Well, all we ended up doing
was creating a new breed of roaches.

97
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:31,716
- Is that right?
- Bigger, stronger and harder to kill.

98
00:09:35,102 --> 00:09:37,854
You wanna play poker?
Five-card draw.

99
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,395
Might as well.

100
00:09:40,566 --> 00:09:43,353
Let's clear some of
this stuff away and get going.

101
00:09:45,613 --> 00:09:48,898
I just hope my wife isn't gonna have
any trouble, you know?

102
00:09:49,116 --> 00:09:51,358
She did the last baby in 45 minutes.

103
00:09:51,576 --> 00:09:53,484
- No kidding.
- That's a fact.

104
00:09:55,747 --> 00:09:58,952
I thought they said
the second one came faster.

105
00:09:59,418 --> 00:10:03,711
You got nothing to complain about.
My wife's been in labor for six hours.

106
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:21,179
Son of a bitch of a thing
stole my 50 cents!

107
00:10:27,571 --> 00:10:29,528
Hey, hold it.

108
00:10:30,739 --> 00:10:35,782
Here's your 50 cents.
No, really. No, no. Here's 50 cents.

109
00:10:36,413 --> 00:10:41,323
Go on. Sit down and read a magazine
or something.

110
00:10:44,255 --> 00:10:47,090
You know what's the biggest problem
in Beverly Hills?

111
00:10:47,258 --> 00:10:50,791
Snails. Yeah, snails and slugs.

112
00:10:51,677 --> 00:10:54,086
They can wipe out a lawn
in just a few weeks.

113
00:10:54,473 --> 00:10:56,430
Folks feel sorry for them.

114
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,600
They're not like
your usual pest, you know?

115
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:03,981
Folks just hate to see all them snails
laying on their lawns, dead.

116
00:11:04,692 --> 00:11:07,477
Snails and slugs and bugs.

117
00:11:08,445 --> 00:11:11,363
Any of you guys
in a happier profession?

118
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,145
I think we've got
a really effective anesthetic.

119
00:11:43,313 --> 00:11:46,931
We'll check you before
we really do anything.

120
00:11:47,109 --> 00:11:51,854
- You know, I hurt...
- But you're doing just great.

121
00:11:52,822 --> 00:11:54,066
It's been different than...

122
00:11:54,241 --> 00:11:56,614
You've done your share, we'll do ours.

123
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,752
She's fully dilated.
The head's on the perineum.

124
00:12:12,552 --> 00:12:15,965
- I know something's wrong.
- It's nothing wrong, honey...

125
00:12:16,137 --> 00:12:18,628
...it's just a very, very big baby.

126
00:12:19,015 --> 00:12:23,096
- Gonna be fine, but I need your help.
- I know something's wrong.

127
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:26,435
How big was your last baby?
How big, did you say?

128
00:12:26,605 --> 00:12:30,852
Seven pounds, 4 ounces. I told you
that this baby was different than Chris.

129
00:12:31,027 --> 00:12:33,102
This baby is just gigantic.

130
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,656
It's probably 10, 10 1/2,
maybe even 11 pounds.

131
00:12:37,825 --> 00:12:40,946
Got a gigantic head,
but she's got a big pelvis.

132
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:43,403
And she's got plenty of relaxation.

133
00:12:43,581 --> 00:12:45,870
I'm trying to cooperate.

134
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:49,411
All right, all right. Relax. Relax.

135
00:12:50,422 --> 00:12:52,578
This thing is just immense.

136
00:12:52,924 --> 00:12:58,297
Now, we're just putting forceps
on the baby's head. Just breathe deep.

137
00:12:59,596 --> 00:13:05,387
Don't push, just pant.
Now, we're just easing the baby out.

138
00:13:05,813 --> 00:13:08,645
- Something's wrong.
- All right.

139
00:13:10,065 --> 00:13:12,901
Now, we just cut you.
You didn't feel that, did you?

140
00:13:13,068 --> 00:13:14,444
- No.
- Okay, fine.

141
00:13:14,611 --> 00:13:17,697
Now, the baby will be out
in just about 30 seconds.

142
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:50,228
Davis! Davis! Wait!

143
00:14:14,505 --> 00:14:20,258
What does my baby look like?!
What's wrong with my baby?!

144
00:14:20,594 --> 00:14:21,838
Doctor!

145
00:14:22,011 --> 00:14:24,846
- Doctor!
- Davis, out of here!

146
00:14:28,727 --> 00:14:30,387
Where's the baby?

147
00:14:30,563 --> 00:14:34,641
The umbilical cord's been severed.
Looks like it's been chewed off.

148
00:14:34,816 --> 00:14:37,023
Where's the baby?!
The baby, doctor!

149
00:14:37,235 --> 00:14:39,905
- Get off of me!
- Get your hands off me!

150
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,494
Darling!

151
00:14:54,544 --> 00:14:57,331
- Lenore! Lenore!
- Come on, let's go!

152
00:14:59,341 --> 00:15:02,508
Let me go! Let me go!

153
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,096
Let go of me!

154
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:12,392
- We're gonna calm you down.
- Let me go! My wife!

155
00:15:13,147 --> 00:15:16,064
Who stole my baby, doctor?

156
00:15:19,903 --> 00:15:25,821
Don't. Don't touch me.
Don't you touch me.

157
00:15:26,785 --> 00:15:29,407
They stole my baby.

158
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:35,493
Frank!
I don't want my baby to be dead!

159
00:15:35,711 --> 00:15:40,917
I don't...
Tell me my baby isn't dead, please.

160
00:15:41,091 --> 00:15:44,375
I assure you, Mrs. Davis,
your baby is very much alive.

161
00:15:46,054 --> 00:15:48,462
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

162
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,223
Located a broken skylight
on the third floor.

163
00:15:55,395 --> 00:15:58,267
Blood and excess tissue on the roof.

164
00:16:02,654 --> 00:16:05,689
Lieutenant, what's it look like to you?

165
00:16:10,662 --> 00:16:12,535
Something small.

166
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,405
Doctor.

167
00:16:51,202 --> 00:16:54,036
She's coming out of sedation now.

168
00:16:59,711 --> 00:17:01,253
Lenore?

169
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:07,836
Can you hear me, darling?

170
00:17:08,344 --> 00:17:12,969
Somebody might have abducted our baby
and I'm holding this hospital responsible.

171
00:17:13,182 --> 00:17:17,725
That hole in the skylight isn't large
enough for a full-sized human being.

172
00:17:17,895 --> 00:17:20,386
There's no other way out
of that delivery room.

173
00:17:20,563 --> 00:17:23,934
- The doctor's correct.
- Let's not have a discussion about it.

174
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:27,110
I've asked your husband
to submit to some tests.

175
00:17:27,321 --> 00:17:28,898
And I've refused.

176
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:34,026
You've never been exposed to
radioactivity and radioactive material...

177
00:17:34,202 --> 00:17:38,117
...or undergone extensive x-rays?
- No, doctor, I told you.

178
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:41,823
Well, we can't rule out genetic damage.

179
00:17:42,003 --> 00:17:45,169
I notice you did inquire
about abortion eight months ago.

180
00:17:45,338 --> 00:17:49,716
Doesn't everybody inquire about it now?
It was just a question of convenience.

181
00:17:49,885 --> 00:17:53,384
- We decided to have the baby.
- We all make mistakes.

182
00:17:53,555 --> 00:17:57,634
I apologize for that crack.
Let me talk to you outside. Come on.

183
00:18:21,374 --> 00:18:23,497
You're not afraid of me, are you?

184
00:18:23,668 --> 00:18:27,749
I've always been afraid of you.
Especially those eyes.

185
00:18:33,054 --> 00:18:34,961
I wanted a boy so badly.

186
00:18:36,765 --> 00:18:42,008
I think he was probably very frightened.
I know he's different.

187
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:44,856
Yeah, I just...

188
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:48,606
I think he was probably afraid
they were gonna hurt him.

189
00:18:53,073 --> 00:18:58,114
- Honey...
- He's not ugly.

190
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:07,210
- Oh, you're so exhausted, sweetheart.
- Huh?

191
00:19:08,631 --> 00:19:11,335
You don't know what you're saying.

192
00:19:11,965 --> 00:19:13,876
I'm gonna check up on those two.

193
00:19:15,052 --> 00:19:17,092
I don't trust them.

194
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:21,548
I mean, can you imagine?

195
00:19:22,226 --> 00:19:25,845
Can you imagine those guys,
trying to blame us?

196
00:19:26,021 --> 00:19:27,682
We are the parents, sweetheart.

197
00:19:40,661 --> 00:19:44,790
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

198
00:19:50,047 --> 00:19:52,371
Doctor Norton decided
your wife can go home.

199
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:55,038
- First thing in the morning.
- You realize...

200
00:19:55,219 --> 00:19:58,965
...it's in everyone's interest
to keep this quiet for the time being...

201
00:19:59,138 --> 00:20:02,506
...at least until we can find out
what's become of the infant.

202
00:20:02,683 --> 00:20:05,600
- You have heard no word about it?
- No.

203
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:09,435
I don't see how it could survive
without clothing and nourishment.

204
00:20:09,606 --> 00:20:15,146
- Of course, like any animal, it may be...
- Well, it's not an animal, doctor...

205
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,314
...you know that very well.

206
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:21,480
Whatever it is,
you can't classify it as an animal.

207
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,609
It's human, doctor, and that's
what's disgusting to you, isn't it?

208
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:27,415
It kills like an animal.

209
00:20:27,584 --> 00:20:32,160
And when we find it,
we're gonna have to destroy it like one.

210
00:20:33,505 --> 00:20:35,710
Well, I don't care.

211
00:20:35,883 --> 00:20:38,125
I suppose you have
to do what's necessary.

212
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:40,093
I'm glad you feel that way.

213
00:20:40,263 --> 00:20:43,632
I only hope your wife
understands as well.

214
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,885
What's there to understand?

215
00:20:49,271 --> 00:20:52,970
- Better not to think about it.
- Hey, look...

216
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:57,563
...why not say good night to your
wife and maybe I drive you home.

217
00:20:57,737 --> 00:20:59,695
No, thanks.

218
00:21:02,535 --> 00:21:07,030
Okay, darling,
I'll see you in the morning.

219
00:21:20,511 --> 00:21:22,467
Stay on duty.

220
00:22:54,897 --> 00:22:58,098
<i>Police still offer</i>
<i>no explanation in the five deaths...</i>

221
00:22:58,274 --> 00:23:01,726
<i>... which occurred early today</i>
<i>at Saint George Medical Center.</i>

222
00:23:01,903 --> 00:23:04,359
<i>Officers are still working</i>
<i>around the clock.</i>

223
00:23:04,531 --> 00:23:07,366
<i>Sources at the hospital alleged</i>
<i>the deaths resulted...</i>

224
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:11,151
<i>... from attacks by an infant</i>
<i>born only today in a mutated form...</i>

225
00:23:11,329 --> 00:23:13,155
<i>... but officials declined comment.</i>

226
00:23:13,331 --> 00:23:17,079
<i>This station has acquired information</i>
<i>naming Mr. And Mrs. Frank Davis...</i>

227
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,785
<i>... of West Los Angeles as the parents</i>
<i>of the infant in question.</i>

228
00:23:20,964 --> 00:23:24,379
<i>The whereabouts of the newborn child</i>
<i>are not known.</i>

229
00:23:24,551 --> 00:23:29,012
They named us.
The bastards, they named us.

230
00:26:34,615 --> 00:26:37,402
Barbara, would you
come here for a minute, please?

231
00:26:37,576 --> 00:26:39,448
- Yes?
- I have to pick up my wife...

232
00:26:39,618 --> 00:26:43,450
...at the hospital tonight. Reschedule
the Sturbridge dinner for tomorrow.

233
00:26:43,622 --> 00:26:47,834
- I think Mr. Clayton wants to talk to you.
- And about the Marcus affair...

234
00:26:48,586 --> 00:26:53,497
...I think we can have cocktails at 6:30
tomorrow. I know he wants to approve...

235
00:26:53,673 --> 00:26:58,383
...the campaign by the end of the week.
- I think you better see Mr. Clayton now.

236
00:26:58,929 --> 00:27:00,257
All right.

237
00:27:01,016 --> 00:27:03,091
I'll be right back.

238
00:27:13,736 --> 00:27:16,570
- Well, well, come on in.
- Hello, Bob.

239
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:19,022
You must be exhausted.
You eaten anything?

240
00:27:19,199 --> 00:27:22,569
Get Frank a couple of poached eggs
on an English muffin...

241
00:27:22,746 --> 00:27:26,493
...with a side of bacon
and a tall glass of fresh orange juice.

242
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:29,413
Should do the trick.
Don't want you collapsing.

243
00:27:29,584 --> 00:27:32,205
Frank, don't let it get you down.

244
00:27:32,379 --> 00:27:35,546
These things happen,
or at least that's what they say.

245
00:27:35,716 --> 00:27:37,957
- Who's they?
- I spoke to the hospital.

246
00:27:38,178 --> 00:27:39,588
They give you information?

247
00:27:39,762 --> 00:27:42,336
Well, I got connections over there,
you know.

248
00:27:42,515 --> 00:27:47,058
I'm the vice-chairman of the fundraising
committee. If there's anything I can do...

249
00:27:47,228 --> 00:27:49,932
No. Thanks.
I'm getting her out of there tonight.

250
00:27:51,273 --> 00:27:52,648
You think that's wise?

251
00:27:56,696 --> 00:27:59,614
Say, Barbara told me
you wanted to rap with me.

252
00:28:00,282 --> 00:28:02,156
Yeah, Frank.

253
00:28:04,786 --> 00:28:06,909
Frank, you...

254
00:28:07,456 --> 00:28:11,407
- You've accrued three weeks vacation.
- Yeah.

255
00:28:11,586 --> 00:28:15,666
You think it'd be a good idea
if you took it now?

256
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:20,668
I can't, Bob.
I mean, I got the Marcus account...

257
00:28:20,846 --> 00:28:25,305
...and the Sturbridge campaign.
I'm just bogged down in work.

258
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:29,851
Besides, I need to work.
It keeps my mind off things.

259
00:28:30,019 --> 00:28:32,974
Frank, we're running
a public-relations business here.

260
00:28:33,149 --> 00:28:38,190
Our job is creating an image. And right
now, well, you're a little controversial.

261
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,067
See, our clients want
their PR men to be anonymous.

262
00:28:42,283 --> 00:28:46,860
Maybe after a little while,
when you're a little less of a celebrity.

263
00:28:50,707 --> 00:28:54,623
You're not taking those accounts
away from me, are you?

264
00:28:54,794 --> 00:28:58,247
I mean, not now. Last-minute?

265
00:28:58,634 --> 00:29:01,798
These things happen, Frank.

266
00:29:01,967 --> 00:29:06,297
Look, you know O'Connors down
in accounting? He's got a retarded kid.

267
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,886
Insists on keeping him in the house too.
Well, nobody thinks a thing of that.

268
00:29:11,062 --> 00:29:13,137
Nobody blames him.

269
00:29:14,106 --> 00:29:19,776
We're not talking about a retarded kid
and you know it.

270
00:29:20,571 --> 00:29:24,235
We're talking about
a monstrosity of some kind.

271
00:29:24,867 --> 00:29:28,733
Yeah, well, maybe we better
not talk about that.

272
00:29:43,468 --> 00:29:45,011
Bob.

273
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:50,511
I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.

274
00:29:52,227 --> 00:29:54,219
Just that I...

275
00:29:54,396 --> 00:29:58,689
I don't know what to do, Bob.
How to behave.

276
00:29:59,025 --> 00:30:01,148
And they...

277
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:07,318
Putting microphones in my face. They're
asking me questions I don't understand.

278
00:30:07,533 --> 00:30:10,488
You know, what you need
is a good public-relations firm...

279
00:30:10,661 --> 00:30:12,820
...to handle all of that for you.

280
00:30:21,213 --> 00:30:23,706
That's very funny.

281
00:30:25,468 --> 00:30:27,176
Bob...

282
00:30:29,263 --> 00:30:31,967
Bob, this is all gonna be all right,
isn't it?

283
00:30:32,142 --> 00:30:35,309
When whatever this thing is
is dead. Right?

284
00:30:36,437 --> 00:30:37,765
Maybe it already is.

285
00:30:38,814 --> 00:30:42,765
Look, Frank, why don't you go down
the service elevator...

286
00:30:42,943 --> 00:30:45,861
...you won't have to meet
all those media people.

287
00:30:46,781 --> 00:30:49,106
Bob...

288
00:30:57,458 --> 00:30:59,497
Take care.

289
00:31:12,891 --> 00:31:18,229
Have them empty out his desk.
Send his personal articles to his house.

290
00:31:18,397 --> 00:31:19,770
He won't be coming back.

291
00:31:21,983 --> 00:31:25,148
- What did it look like?
- I got nothing to say.

292
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:27,810
- What are you afraid of?
- Get out of my face.

293
00:31:27,988 --> 00:31:29,815
I got no comment.

294
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:33,442
Get that goddamn thing out of my face!
Get out of the way!

295
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,860
- What did it look like?
- I don't know.

296
00:31:36,038 --> 00:31:39,372
Never mind my baby!
Leave my wife out of it, you understand?

297
00:31:45,088 --> 00:31:46,962
Aren't we almost home?

298
00:31:49,302 --> 00:31:51,460
We'll be there in a few minutes.

299
00:31:52,096 --> 00:31:57,801
Oh, I feel better already,
getting out of that terrible place.

300
00:31:57,976 --> 00:32:01,559
I don't have to take more shots, do I?
I don't like taking shots.

301
00:32:01,731 --> 00:32:07,436
- I don't like being made to go to sleep.
- Well, I engaged nurses in three shifts.

302
00:32:07,945 --> 00:32:10,815
I'm surprised anybody
would even wanna work for us.

303
00:32:14,076 --> 00:32:17,776
- Well, Dr. Norton took care of it.
- Oh, good.

304
00:32:18,747 --> 00:32:21,997
And I'm gonna be there all the time.

305
00:32:22,501 --> 00:32:24,659
- What about...
- Yeah, I told the office...

306
00:32:24,837 --> 00:32:27,837
...I have to have those three weeks
vacation they owe me.

307
00:32:28,007 --> 00:32:33,427
Oh, what about that Marcus account?
That was very important to you.

308
00:32:33,595 --> 00:32:34,875
You're more important.

309
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:38,471
What about Chris? Have you told him?
Does he know anything?

310
00:32:38,643 --> 00:32:40,884
I spoke to Charley.

311
00:32:41,646 --> 00:32:46,141
He kept him home from school.
Hasn't told him anything.

312
00:32:46,314 --> 00:32:50,360
- Good.
- Sooner or later, he'll switch on the TV.

313
00:32:50,529 --> 00:32:53,066
It's only so long you can keep
a secret like that.

314
00:32:53,699 --> 00:32:56,947
Dad, why can't I go to school or go out
or have friends over?

315
00:32:57,409 --> 00:33:00,245
Chris, I can't tell you now, son.

316
00:33:00,414 --> 00:33:03,332
You'll have to trust me.
You do trust me, don't you?

317
00:33:03,502 --> 00:33:05,956
- Sure, Dad.
<i>- You have to spend all your time...</i>

318
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:09,206
...with Charley this week.
You wouldn't mind that.

319
00:33:09,715 --> 00:33:13,630
Chris. Chris, hey, buddy,
you don't wanna hurt his feelings.

320
00:33:13,843 --> 00:33:16,879
I like Charley, but I wanna
see Mom and the baby.

321
00:33:17,054 --> 00:33:19,131
<i>- The baby's not home yet.</i>
- Is it sick?

322
00:33:19,892 --> 00:33:23,141
Yeah, that's right, son.
The baby's sick.

323
00:33:23,311 --> 00:33:27,772
And everything here's a mess.
So it would be much better...

324
00:33:27,941 --> 00:33:32,270
...if you stay where you are.
- You tell Charley to let me watch TV?

325
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:35,363
<i>- Okay, put him on.</i>
- Okay.

326
00:33:39,534 --> 00:33:43,321
Okay, Frank. Look, we'll take care
of everything. Hey, I had an idea.

327
00:33:43,497 --> 00:33:45,870
I'll take Chris up to the lake
for fishing.

328
00:33:46,418 --> 00:33:48,209
Okay, Charley. Thank you.

329
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:50,542
Oh, and give my love to Lenore.

330
00:33:51,131 --> 00:33:53,039
Thanks, Charley.

331
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:23,362
Hunting and killing babies
doesn't seem to be my specialty.

332
00:34:23,538 --> 00:34:25,577
So, what do you want, a transfer?

333
00:34:25,749 --> 00:34:28,205
Well, my wife's in her eighth month.

334
00:34:28,377 --> 00:34:31,128
Since I started this,
she hasn't gotten any rest.

335
00:34:31,338 --> 00:34:34,291
Me being so involved
really brings it home.

336
00:34:35,632 --> 00:34:38,503
Besides, I guess you know
we lost our last baby.

337
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:41,888
Look, you're lucky you don't have
grown kids nowadays.

338
00:34:42,055 --> 00:34:45,924
People without children
don't realize how lucky they are.

339
00:34:46,769 --> 00:34:48,097
Take these.

340
00:34:51,439 --> 00:34:53,599
Make you feel much better.

341
00:35:01,743 --> 00:35:04,578
Did you see it, Mrs. Davis?

342
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,870
Surely you must have gotten
one glimpse.

343
00:35:16,257 --> 00:35:19,175
They say it has teeth and claws.
Did you know that?

344
00:35:19,594 --> 00:35:21,633
How should I know that?

345
00:35:23,098 --> 00:35:27,558
Were you aware that it killed
another person just last night?

346
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:32,057
A musician on Santa Monica Boulevard.
He was on his way home from work...

347
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:34,308
...about 2 in the morning...

348
00:35:34,483 --> 00:35:36,808
...and that was the last anybody
saw of him.

349
00:35:36,985 --> 00:35:39,274
They found him in an alley.

350
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:43,901
Well, they can't be sure that it was...

351
00:35:44,494 --> 00:35:46,450
There's no doubt about it.

352
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:49,953
The wounds are the same
as the doctor and nurses suffered.

353
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:56,628
Well...

354
00:35:58,381 --> 00:36:02,712
- Well, what do you want me to say?
- Just say anything you feel.

355
00:36:08,016 --> 00:36:12,096
- What's under that napkin?
- There's nothing there.

356
00:36:12,979 --> 00:36:15,601
A recorder! A tape recorder!

357
00:36:15,817 --> 00:36:18,057
I'm a nurse. You can tell me anything.

358
00:36:18,235 --> 00:36:21,899
- Who are you working for?
- I really am a registered nurse...

359
00:36:22,071 --> 00:36:24,561
...and I write a little on the side.

360
00:36:24,741 --> 00:36:28,027
She's taking interviews
on a tape recorder.

361
00:36:39,966 --> 00:36:42,123
Get out.

362
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,484
Frank?

363
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:10,610
We just have to get rid
of everybody.

364
00:37:10,787 --> 00:37:14,406
- Let's not have any more nurses, honey.
- All right.

365
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:17,294
We'll let them all go.

366
00:37:23,382 --> 00:37:26,135
Should have known better...

367
00:37:27,303 --> 00:37:30,258
...than to trust anybody.

368
00:41:10,066 --> 00:41:14,194
Actually, already in excess
of $ 100,000 has been allocated...

369
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:19,231
...by the university for examination
of this phenomenon.

370
00:41:19,409 --> 00:41:21,864
We have some of the leading men
in the field.

371
00:41:22,036 --> 00:41:26,082
It's hoped this might lead to a
breakthrough to a better understanding...

372
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,705
...of why mutations occur.

373
00:41:31,504 --> 00:41:33,461
You wanna experiment on it?

374
00:41:33,672 --> 00:41:37,919
My department has already cautioned
the police about excessive violence.

375
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:42,424
If it could be dispatched with a bullet or,
better still, some kind of a gas.

376
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:46,887
Undoubtedly, it's small and any kind of
bodily harm, especially from gunshots...

377
00:41:47,061 --> 00:41:50,063
...or explosives...
- In other words, you want me...

378
00:41:50,232 --> 00:41:51,642
...to sign away the body?

379
00:41:51,859 --> 00:41:55,476
Well, it's your right. After all,
you are the child's father.

380
00:41:56,821 --> 00:41:58,778
It's not my child.

381
00:41:58,989 --> 00:42:01,114
That's very wise...

382
00:42:01,283 --> 00:42:04,070
...to disassociate yourself emotionally.

383
00:42:05,787 --> 00:42:09,655
Just sign each copy, please.

384
00:42:09,833 --> 00:42:11,210
- Pen?
- Give him a pen.

385
00:42:20,802 --> 00:42:25,512
You know, it seems that
out of every tragedy, out of every evil...

386
00:42:25,682 --> 00:42:29,217
...some good can come if we
only apply ourselves.

387
00:42:29,394 --> 00:42:33,061
I suppose that's gonna be in all
the medical journals?

388
00:42:33,274 --> 00:42:34,768
History books?

389
00:42:35,442 --> 00:42:38,693
"The Davis child."
"The Davis monster."

390
00:42:40,697 --> 00:42:43,022
It's like Frankenstein.

391
00:42:44,327 --> 00:42:49,154
In my opinion, this will be remembered
long after each of us is forgotten.

392
00:42:49,373 --> 00:42:52,327
When I was a kid, I always thought...

393
00:42:52,501 --> 00:42:57,293
...the monster was Frankenstein. Karloff
walking around in big shoes, grunting.

394
00:42:57,465 --> 00:43:00,086
I thought he was Frankenstein.

395
00:43:01,176 --> 00:43:03,714
Then I went to high school
and read the book...

396
00:43:03,929 --> 00:43:09,088
...and I realized that Frankenstein
was the...

397
00:43:09,642 --> 00:43:12,264
...doctor who created him.

398
00:43:13,063 --> 00:43:15,638
Somehow the identities...

399
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:19,564
...get all mixed up, don't they?

400
00:43:23,658 --> 00:43:28,949
One must not allow oneself
to be impressed by escapist fiction.

401
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,613
You forgot one.

402
00:43:32,082 --> 00:43:33,576
Pen.

403
00:43:43,051 --> 00:43:44,379
Frank, darling?

404
00:43:50,601 --> 00:43:52,476
Hi, darling.

405
00:43:52,645 --> 00:43:56,309
Mrs. Davis, I don't suppose you
took the pills I gave you.

406
00:43:56,523 --> 00:43:58,811
You really should, you know.

407
00:43:58,984 --> 00:44:03,113
Maybe it's all the pills I've taken
over the years that brought this on.

408
00:44:05,407 --> 00:44:07,694
You really shouldn't be downstairs.

409
00:44:08,577 --> 00:44:11,946
Maybe you'd both like
to have dinner with us.

410
00:44:12,163 --> 00:44:14,834
I have wonderful lamb chops
in the refrigerator.

411
00:44:15,042 --> 00:44:16,950
No, I'm afraid not.

412
00:44:18,293 --> 00:44:22,079
Honey, why don't you go down
to the basement and get a bottle...

413
00:44:22,257 --> 00:44:26,125
...of that nice Beaujolais. Won't that
go nicely with the lamb chops?

414
00:44:28,054 --> 00:44:30,723
We have quite an extensive wine cellar.

415
00:44:30,891 --> 00:44:35,019
It's one of Frank's many hobbies.
My husband's a many-faceted man.

416
00:44:37,272 --> 00:44:39,514
I'll show these gentlemen to the door.

417
00:45:00,002 --> 00:45:02,540
I'll get that wine.

418
00:45:02,714 --> 00:45:05,715
Oh, great, great. Good. Good.

419
00:46:12,117 --> 00:46:15,200
Boy, that basement's filthy.

420
00:46:17,998 --> 00:46:21,497
How long had she taken birth
control pills before this pregnancy?

421
00:46:21,709 --> 00:46:23,535
- Thirty-one months.
- You realize...

422
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:26,664
...I came from the East
specifically for this matter.

423
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:29,793
I realize that it is a police problem.

424
00:46:29,968 --> 00:46:33,715
But once the thing is killed,
it becomes a medical problem. Now...

425
00:46:33,889 --> 00:46:36,295
...you are in charge of that department?

426
00:46:36,473 --> 00:46:38,347
- Yes, I suppose so.
- Now...

427
00:46:38,516 --> 00:46:40,973
...nobody knows how
this thing happened.

428
00:46:41,144 --> 00:46:45,060
It's really a matter of speculation
and perhaps that's for the best.

429
00:46:45,232 --> 00:46:50,393
After all, if we find out that the cause
is medication that we manufacture...

430
00:46:50,571 --> 00:46:53,572
...and it was administered over
a long period of time...

431
00:46:53,741 --> 00:46:57,821
...it'd be bad for you and worse for us.
We're susceptible to lawsuits.

432
00:46:57,993 --> 00:47:01,827
We'd think the government hadn't tested
and approved of those products...

433
00:47:01,998 --> 00:47:03,576
...that we put on the market.

434
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:06,205
What do your interests recommend?

435
00:47:07,046 --> 00:47:11,338
Absolute destruction of this thing.

436
00:47:11,508 --> 00:47:15,672
Well, they've already signed over
the remains to the university.

437
00:47:15,846 --> 00:47:20,473
But if there was nothing left of it...

438
00:47:20,642 --> 00:47:24,142
...we would be most grateful to you.

439
00:47:26,106 --> 00:47:29,605
You have had
a very successful career...

440
00:47:29,776 --> 00:47:32,646
...until this freak incident.

441
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:36,112
You know, it could
work out for the best.

442
00:47:36,283 --> 00:47:41,704
We have an opening on the board of our
research and development department.

443
00:47:41,913 --> 00:47:45,282
Now, we wouldn't want people
to lose faith in us, would we?

444
00:49:00,032 --> 00:49:02,701
- Hello?
- <i>Dr. Norton, please</i>.

445
00:49:03,661 --> 00:49:07,161
No, Dr. Norton stepped out
for a moment. May I take a message?

446
00:49:07,332 --> 00:49:11,114
<i>Tell him they've cornered the infant</i>
<i>at the Hawthorn School...</i>

447
00:49:11,293 --> 00:49:13,749
<i>... in West Los Angeles.</i>

448
00:49:14,339 --> 00:49:16,130
That's a few blocks from here.

449
00:49:16,341 --> 00:49:19,958
<i>Ask the doctor to get over there</i>
<i>if he can. Thank you.</i>

450
00:49:28,103 --> 00:49:30,474
I have to go out for a while.

451
00:49:30,646 --> 00:49:32,022
All right.

452
00:49:32,231 --> 00:49:34,722
- You don't mind staying alone?
- Uh-uh.

453
00:49:35,526 --> 00:49:38,194
I'll keep everything warm.

454
00:49:59,215 --> 00:50:03,427
Wait a minute, I'm Frank Davis.
I wanna see Lieutenant Perkins.

455
00:50:03,595 --> 00:50:05,802
All right, take him.

456
00:50:22,156 --> 00:50:24,777
Wonder what's the matter with him.

457
00:50:24,949 --> 00:50:27,156
Screwed-up genes or something.

458
00:50:48,933 --> 00:50:50,888
Wait here.

459
00:51:45,738 --> 00:51:49,073
Davis, how the hell did you
find out about this?

460
00:51:49,951 --> 00:51:53,651
There was a phone call for Dr. Norton.
I took the message.

461
00:51:54,955 --> 00:51:56,785
My son Chris goes to school here.

462
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,491
I've been here a million times,
PTA meetings.

463
00:52:00,962 --> 00:52:04,746
- Your kid goes here?
- That's right. He's in the sixth grade.

464
00:52:09,595 --> 00:52:11,386
Listen.

465
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:14,681
Probably just a coincidence.

466
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:18,517
Look, Perkins, I want this thing
destroyed as much as anybody else.

467
00:52:18,689 --> 00:52:20,646
- I realize that.
- Yeah, you realize.

468
00:52:20,815 --> 00:52:23,140
Then why is everybody looking at me?

469
00:52:24,277 --> 00:52:25,985
Yeah.

470
00:52:26,196 --> 00:52:30,240
Like it's my own flesh and blood
or something.

471
00:52:30,451 --> 00:52:34,318
Well, it's not! Understand?

472
00:52:34,496 --> 00:52:36,737
It's no relation to me.

473
00:52:38,541 --> 00:52:41,211
Nobody's looking at you.

474
00:53:20,499 --> 00:53:24,960
Say, you have my deepest sympathy.

475
00:53:25,129 --> 00:53:26,753
You and your wife.

476
00:53:26,923 --> 00:53:29,330
Is it all right
if your driver drops me off...

477
00:53:29,508 --> 00:53:32,509
...a block from my home?
I don't want my wife to see me.

478
00:53:32,721 --> 00:53:35,722
You don't want her to know
you were here tonight?

479
00:53:35,889 --> 00:53:39,970
I don't think she'd know how to take it.
Maybe I didn't do the right thing.

480
00:53:40,144 --> 00:53:43,478
I'm just trying to show everybody
I feel the same way they do.

481
00:53:43,648 --> 00:53:46,138
- I'm no different from anybody.
- We know that.

482
00:53:46,317 --> 00:53:48,474
I got a boy, 11 years old.
He's healthy.

483
00:53:48,653 --> 00:53:50,445
- He's brilliant.
- I understand.

484
00:53:50,654 --> 00:53:52,731
You don't have
to keep telling us that.

485
00:53:52,906 --> 00:53:56,572
We realize that.
Look, I gotta go back on duty.

486
00:54:09,047 --> 00:54:11,622
Take him wherever he wants to go.

487
00:55:38,637 --> 00:55:41,922
Davis said his kid went to this school.

488
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:48,096
Now, why, in all of Los Angeles,
would it happen to show up here?

489
00:55:49,522 --> 00:55:52,477
Maybe it's looking for somebody.

490
00:57:14,898 --> 00:57:20,320
I'd like us to all get together again
and be a family.

491
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:23,898
You know, I'm trying.
I'm really trying very hard, Frank.

492
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:26,319
I can see that.

493
00:57:26,535 --> 00:57:29,490
Wouldn't it be a great idea
to bring Chris home?

494
00:57:29,997 --> 00:57:31,489
He's better off where he is.

495
00:59:32,576 --> 00:59:34,819
Lenore, did you go out?

496
00:59:47,926 --> 00:59:50,415
Lenore?

497
00:59:58,102 --> 01:00:00,557
Lenore.

498
01:00:00,729 --> 01:00:03,566
For chrissakes, answer me.

499
01:00:26,547 --> 01:00:29,998
Oh. Are you feeling better?

500
01:00:30,385 --> 01:00:32,294
Where the hell have you been?

501
01:00:32,468 --> 01:00:35,637
- I've been straightening up.
- I've been calling you.

502
01:00:38,977 --> 01:00:42,226
I've been all over the house,
straightening up.

503
01:00:43,646 --> 01:00:47,348
Where? You weren't downstairs.
Didn't you hear me calling you?

504
01:00:47,526 --> 01:00:50,230
Honey, there's a good movie on
with Paul Newman.

505
01:00:52,032 --> 01:00:54,605
I gotta get something in my stomach.

506
01:00:54,785 --> 01:00:57,109
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

507
01:01:24,689 --> 01:01:27,060
Chris come back here today?

508
01:01:30,277 --> 01:01:33,776
I said, has Chris been back here today?

509
01:01:36,782 --> 01:01:38,860
No.

510
01:01:39,035 --> 01:01:41,113
Why do you say that?

511
01:01:47,712 --> 01:01:49,289
You wouldn't lie to me?

512
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:56,838
I know you wanted Chris to come
back, but I specifically told you...

513
01:02:14,905 --> 01:02:16,897
Chris.

514
01:02:34,298 --> 01:02:36,338
Chris?

515
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:40,333
Chris, are you hiding someplace?

516
01:02:41,973 --> 01:02:44,050
Don't fool around, now.

517
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:50,117
I wish somebody would respect
my feelings around here.

518
01:03:50,333 --> 01:03:52,658
Why are you watching that stuff?

519
01:03:52,877 --> 01:03:55,284
I thought you wanted
to watch a movie.

520
01:04:00,676 --> 01:04:02,918
Who are you calling?
Don't call anybody.

521
01:04:03,096 --> 01:04:05,882
Please don't call anybody.
Who are you calling?

522
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:08,850
- How's Chris?
- Had a hell of a time keeping him...

523
01:04:09,019 --> 01:04:10,761
...from the newscasts and papers.

524
01:04:10,937 --> 01:04:14,437
But the teacher sent over schoolwork,
so he's been keeping busy.

525
01:04:14,649 --> 01:04:16,521
You've been with him all the time?

526
01:04:16,735 --> 01:04:19,190
We just got back
from that fishing trip.

527
01:04:19,361 --> 01:04:21,733
He hasn't been out of my sight
for a minute.

528
01:04:21,905 --> 01:04:26,863
- Look, you wanna talk to him?
- No, I don't wanna talk to him.

529
01:04:28,330 --> 01:04:31,947
- Hi, Dad. When can I come home?
- Did you come back here today?

530
01:04:32,166 --> 01:04:34,540
Is the baby home
from the hospital yet?

531
01:04:37,838 --> 01:04:40,625
Did I do anything wrong?

532
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:44,798
- Hey, how about something to eat?
- No, I'm not hungry. I wanna go to bed.

533
01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:48,173
- I'm sorry, Charley. I'm not mad at you.
- That's okay, kid.

534
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:53,551
Honey, I want you to make love to me.
I want you to hold me and love me.

535
01:04:53,728 --> 01:04:55,520
You know, there are other ways.

536
01:04:55,689 --> 01:04:58,441
- Come on, sweetheart.
- There's no ice in there.

537
01:04:58,607 --> 01:05:02,736
I'll get the ice. Wait a minute,
I'll get the ice. Wait, I'll get the...

538
01:05:23,384 --> 01:05:25,091
Chris?

539
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:34,344
Chris?

540
01:05:41,026 --> 01:05:44,276
Oh, my God. Chris!

541
01:05:53,082 --> 01:05:54,907
Lenore?

542
01:09:14,196 --> 01:09:16,816
What were you doing down
in the basement?

543
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:19,398
You know.

544
01:09:49,941 --> 01:09:52,514
What are you gonna do?
What are you doing?

545
01:09:59,949 --> 01:10:03,034
Why are you so anxious
to be the one to do it?

546
01:10:15,339 --> 01:10:19,468
Who is it? Mom? Dad?

547
01:10:35,359 --> 01:10:37,649
Frank. Frank, wait. Wait. Wait.

548
01:10:37,863 --> 01:10:41,279
Frank, he could've killed you
when you were upstairs sleeping!

549
01:10:41,450 --> 01:10:43,526
- Let go of me.
- He could've killed you!

550
01:10:43,701 --> 01:10:46,193
Do you know why he didn't kill you?

551
01:10:52,503 --> 01:10:53,831
Hello?

552
01:10:57,173 --> 01:11:01,004
- He knows you're his father.
- What are you, crazy?

553
01:11:01,177 --> 01:11:02,506
He knows.

554
01:11:04,347 --> 01:11:07,466
He knows you're his father.

555
01:11:26,410 --> 01:11:29,662
Don't worry. Don't be scared.

556
01:11:32,499 --> 01:11:34,623
I'll protect you.

557
01:11:36,128 --> 01:11:39,961
It's a boy, you know. It's a boy.

558
01:11:40,174 --> 01:11:42,666
- I'll protect you.
- Chris, look out.

559
01:11:47,765 --> 01:11:49,675
I hit it. I'm sure I hit it.

560
01:11:50,184 --> 01:11:52,472
Charley! Look out, Charley!

561
01:11:55,648 --> 01:11:57,688
Charley!

562
01:12:02,530 --> 01:12:07,525
Go on, get down. Did you see it?
Did you see it? What does it look like?

563
01:12:07,827 --> 01:12:10,281
It's no relation to us, Chris.

564
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:13,039
It can't be.

565
01:12:21,757 --> 01:12:24,425
See what your baby did to Charley?

566
01:12:27,388 --> 01:12:29,794
What did you do?

567
01:12:31,516 --> 01:12:34,636
Will you tell him
about the doctors in the hospital?!

568
01:12:35,145 --> 01:12:37,850
Now, go on, take my son upstairs.

569
01:12:38,858 --> 01:12:42,690
The doctors at the hospital were
trying to suffocate your little brother.

570
01:12:42,862 --> 01:12:44,191
He just wants to live.

571
01:13:24,987 --> 01:13:29,364
You should've called us as soon
as you suspected it was near the house.

572
01:13:29,533 --> 01:13:31,775
It's lost a lot of blood.

573
01:13:31,952 --> 01:13:36,247
And it's my opinion that our troubles
are very nearly over.

574
01:13:36,414 --> 01:13:40,791
- So shall we go?
- I wanna leave some men here.

575
01:13:41,045 --> 01:13:43,796
In case it decides
to double back to the house.

576
01:13:56,266 --> 01:13:57,976
I would...

577
01:13:58,145 --> 01:14:00,220
I would like to go with you.

578
01:14:00,396 --> 01:14:05,059
- Haven't you done enough already?
- No. Not yet.

579
01:14:07,153 --> 01:14:09,858
You have to be the one to do it,
don't you?

580
01:14:13,243 --> 01:14:14,902
Have you seen it?

581
01:14:15,495 --> 01:14:17,073
Got a real good look at it?

582
01:14:17,246 --> 01:14:20,413
It was too dark. It wouldn't matter.

583
01:14:21,252 --> 01:14:22,828
I could do it.

584
01:14:23,002 --> 01:14:26,787
You may have done it already,
if it doesn't stop bleeding.

585
01:14:27,924 --> 01:14:30,841
Will you excuse us
for a moment, please?

586
01:14:32,344 --> 01:14:34,173
We just can't take a civilian...

587
01:14:34,348 --> 01:14:39,471
Look, I advise you to let him come along.
After all, it found its way home by itself.

588
01:14:39,645 --> 01:14:44,555
It may be that it'll search out its father,
especially when he put a bullet in it.

589
01:14:44,731 --> 01:14:47,139
What have we got to lose?

590
01:14:47,611 --> 01:14:49,650
One more life.

591
01:14:54,575 --> 01:14:56,652
You know how to use a gun?

592
01:14:56,829 --> 01:14:58,784
Beg your pardon?

593
01:15:01,457 --> 01:15:03,865
Do you know how to use a rifle?

594
01:15:04,793 --> 01:15:06,206
Sure.

595
01:15:09,090 --> 01:15:11,877
We'll issue you one,
for your own protection.

596
01:15:12,053 --> 01:15:13,381
Okay.

597
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:19,349
<i>The shot that</i>
<i>wounded the infant was fired...</i>

598
01:15:19,517 --> 01:15:22,767
<i>... by its father, public-relations executive</i>
<i>Frank Davis...</i>

599
01:15:22,937 --> 01:15:26,638
<i>... who currently is accompanying police</i>
<i>on the manhunt.</i>

600
01:16:00,850 --> 01:16:02,344
That's it.

601
01:16:02,518 --> 01:16:05,603
That's how it can travel
without anybody seeing it.

602
01:16:21,453 --> 01:16:27,492
<i>Units converge</i>
<i>at interceptor point 682 of project 9401</i>.

603
01:16:29,170 --> 01:16:35,965
<i>Close off block sections 21218...</i>

604
01:17:06,039 --> 01:17:10,119
<i>Divide units</i>
<i>to cover all Sacatella, L.A. River and...</i>

605
01:17:22,014 --> 01:17:27,139
<i>- 26 and 34, 1663560-O.</i>

606
01:17:27,311 --> 01:17:30,016
<i>You are now completely closed off</i>
<i>by our units.</i>

607
01:17:30,188 --> 01:17:33,439
<i>Hold position and stand by.</i>

608
01:18:07,686 --> 01:18:09,676
Let me have that.

609
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:20,106
Davis, you stay right here.
Here, take this.

610
01:18:21,364 --> 01:18:23,736
Let's go. You stay here.

611
01:19:18,255 --> 01:19:20,080
It's back there somewhere.

612
01:19:20,256 --> 01:19:25,000
The damned fools must have walked
right by it. Now, I want that thing.

613
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:50,444
- Where's Davis?
- I don't know.

614
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:53,954
- He was supposed to stay here.
- Davis! Davis!

615
01:19:54,124 --> 01:19:57,123
Stay where you are,
we'll come get you!

616
01:20:02,672 --> 01:20:05,675
Davis! Davis, come back.

617
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:28,065
Frank!

618
01:20:29,282 --> 01:20:32,035
Frank, do you hear me?

619
01:21:05,361 --> 01:21:08,029
- Proceeding
to Los Angeles River inlet, as ordered.

620
01:22:02,458 --> 01:22:04,166
No.

621
01:22:05,504 --> 01:22:07,662
Shh...

622
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,915
I know it...

623
01:22:11,175 --> 01:22:13,382
I know it hurts.

624
01:22:14,637 --> 01:22:18,635
I know that.
But everything's gonna be all right.

625
01:22:21,101 --> 01:22:22,846
Uh...

626
01:22:23,521 --> 01:22:25,560
See, I was...

627
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:37,990
I, uh...

628
01:22:40,788 --> 01:22:44,491
I was scared, like you are. Shh...

629
01:22:44,667 --> 01:22:49,079
No, no. You mustn't cry.

630
01:22:49,672 --> 01:22:53,882
Because if you cry,
they'll hear you and they'll come.

631
01:23:01,309 --> 01:23:03,846
Uh...

632
01:23:19,994 --> 01:23:22,236
No, no. It's all right.

633
01:23:22,413 --> 01:23:24,453
It's gonna be all right.

634
01:23:24,874 --> 01:23:27,162
It's gonna be all right.

635
01:23:53,819 --> 01:23:57,104
Shh. Okay.

636
01:23:57,281 --> 01:23:58,740
Okay.

637
01:24:40,781 --> 01:24:43,404
Davis, come on out!

638
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:46,616
Come on out, Davis!

639
01:24:48,831 --> 01:24:50,989
Where are you?

640
01:24:51,877 --> 01:24:53,703
Davis!

641
01:25:34,295 --> 01:25:39,453
<i>Davis is moving</i>
<i>through the tunnel with the infant.</i>

642
01:25:39,634 --> 01:25:41,127
Keep her here.

643
01:25:41,301 --> 01:25:47,006
<i>Drain stopped up ahead, inaccessible.</i>

644
01:25:47,222 --> 01:25:51,885
Can you hear me, Frank?
It can't be saved. It's gotta die.

645
01:25:52,062 --> 01:25:56,854
Just drop it and get the hell away
from it. Do you hear me, Frank?

646
01:26:43,905 --> 01:26:47,025
Frank! Can you hear me?

647
01:27:11,474 --> 01:27:14,924
- All right, just stop there.
Stop right there.

648
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:22,687
It can't hurt anybody.

649
01:27:29,117 --> 01:27:34,359
- Look, lock it up. Study it.
But let it live, please.

650
01:27:35,289 --> 01:27:39,702
Put down your weapons. It's wounded.
It can't hurt anybody.

651
01:27:41,628 --> 01:27:45,921
Just drop it. Just drop it.
Just take it easy and drop it.

652
01:27:48,177 --> 01:27:49,920
Back away. Back away!

653
01:27:50,137 --> 01:27:51,923
- If you fellas shoot,
you're gonna shoot me.

654
01:27:51,924 --> 01:27:53,668
Put the weapon down. It's harmless.

655
01:27:54,682 --> 01:27:56,889
That son of a bitch dies here and now!

656
01:27:57,102 --> 01:27:59,179
Drop it and stand aside, Davis.

657
01:28:01,731 --> 01:28:05,267
In one second, whether you're holding it
or not, I'll put a bullet through it.

658
01:28:05,443 --> 01:28:09,194
- Don't shoot.
- Kill it, lieutenant. Kill it!

659
01:28:09,365 --> 01:28:11,607
Kill it! Kill it now!

660
01:28:19,334 --> 01:28:22,617
Stop firing! Stop firing! Stop firing!

661
01:29:32,155 --> 01:29:34,610
Yeah, I'm bringing them home.

662
01:29:36,075 --> 01:29:40,203
<i>Lieutenant Perkins,</i>
<i>call for you on the private line.</i>

663
01:29:40,371 --> 01:29:42,031
Right.

664
01:29:47,919 --> 01:29:49,663
Perkins.

665
01:29:51,633 --> 01:29:53,376
I understand.

666
01:30:02,643 --> 01:30:05,597
Another one has been born in Seattle.

667
01:30:54,029 --> 01:30:56,104
