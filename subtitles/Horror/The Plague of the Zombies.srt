1
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:50,759
(Groans)

2
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,627
(Drum beats)

3
00:00:55,125 --> 00:01:00,177
Kada nostra, kada estra.

4
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:03,386
Kada nostra, kada estra.

5
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,298
(Whispers) Kada nostra..

6
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:20,426
...kada estra.

7
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:24,669
Kada nostra...

8
00:01:24,792 --> 00:01:26,669
(Drum beats)

9
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:47,381
(Drum beats intensify)

10
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:03,585
(Screams)

11
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,173
- Good morning, Father.
- Good morning, my dear.

12
00:03:41,292 --> 00:03:43,386
- Oh, careful.
- Eh?

13
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,209
Oh, I'm sorry. You should know better
than to barge in here when I'm busy.

14
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,210
- Busy?
- Now, none of that.

15
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,631
When I'm on holiday
this is what keeps me busy.

16
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,798
- Mail, Father.
- I don't want to read it.

17
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:57,000
- There's a letter from Cornwall.
- I don't know anyone in Cornwall.

18
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,878
Yes, you do. Peter Tompson.
I'll open it.

19
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,549
Oh, Peter.
What's he doing down there?

20
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:05,716
Oh, Father, you're impossible.
You know he's got a job down there.

21
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,255
He's General Practitioner.

22
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:10,174
So he did.
What's he up to, then?

23
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,260
Well, why don't you read it
and find out?

24
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,753
- No, you read it.
- All right.

25
00:04:16,292 --> 00:04:17,669
Ah...ah...ah...ah!

26
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,127
"Dear Sir James..."

27
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,130
A typical doctor's handwriting.
it's worse than yours, Father.

28
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,048
Oh, here. Give it to me.

29
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:34,792
Hm. "Just a brief line to inform you...

30
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,380
"For some time our village has been...

31
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,835
"beset by a number
of mysterious and fatal maladies.

32
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:46,757
"People have been dying off...

33
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:50,469
“Lassitude, no will to live...”

34
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,969
Well, this doesn't sound like Peter.
it's very rambling.

35
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,336
I wonder what's it's all about.

36
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:57,880
Well, we could easily find out.

37
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,928
"l desperately need your advice.
Symptoms can't be attributed to..."

38
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:06,886
- Find out? How?
- By going to Cornwall and asking him.

39
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,799
Go to Cornwall?
it's miles away.

40
00:05:09,917 --> 00:05:12,670
Well, you can fish just as well
in Cornwall as here, Father.

41
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,469
Didn't your school friend...

42
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,132
What's her name?
Didn't she marry young Tompson?

43
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,844
- Alice? Mm.
- Ha.

44
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,461
I suppose your suggestion
that we should go to Cornwall

45
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:28,507
has nothing to do with the fact
that you'd like to see her again, eh?

46
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,093
Shall I pack your things?

47
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:33,294
I don't know why
I give in to you so easily.

48
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:34,885
And look up the train times.

49
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:37,919
I don't know why
I put up with you at all.

50
00:05:38,042 --> 00:05:41,046
- I should have drowned you at birth.
- Thank you, Father.

51
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,922
I knew you'd understand.

52
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:04,636
- Come on, then. Come on, then.
- Whoo!

53
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:20,839
Oh, look, Father!

54
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:26,262
Look! A fox!

55
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:33,507
I've seen a fox.
Several of them, in fact.

56
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:37,209
I've no doubt your fox
looks very similar to all the others.

57
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,926
(Shouting)

58
00:06:40,042 --> 00:06:42,795
Oh, they're hunting him!

59
00:06:42,917 --> 00:06:44,919
Father, those men
are hunting that fox.

60
00:06:45,042 --> 00:06:46,794
Men have always hunted.

61
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:49,136
For food, yes. Not for blood lust.

62
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,843
Well, can't you do something, Father?

63
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:56,008
I have not come all this way
to interfere with local customs

64
00:06:56,125 --> 00:07:00,084
and antagonise the people
just to satisfy your sensitivity

65
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,427
about the welfare of wild animals.

66
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:03,919
Father, you must agree that...

67
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:07,091
Just because you are my daughter
doesn't mean I have to agree to...

68
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,881
(Coach man) Whoa, there!

69
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,468
Now what's happened?

70
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:13,257
- You, have you seen him?
- (Coachman) Who, sir?

71
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,469
- The fox, you idiot!
- No, I haven't, young sir.

72
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,301
I've been keeping
my eyes on the road.

73
00:07:17,417 --> 00:07:18,509
Idiot!

74
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,218
Is it a fox you're looking for?

75
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,052
Well, my dear young lady,
that was the idea.

76
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:25,215
I saw him.
He was running that way.

77
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,927
You'll have to hurry to catch him.
He was running fast.

78
00:07:28,042 --> 00:07:29,669
We'll catch him.
Never fear. Come on.

79
00:07:43,792 --> 00:07:47,467
I have a distinct feeling you were not
telling that young man the truth, Sylvia.

80
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,631
Your distinct feeling is correct, Father.

81
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,593
Oh. Well, the fox will be grateful.

82
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:54,587
I doubt if the same can be said
for the young man.

83
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,211
I only hope you don't meet him again.

84
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,627
(Bell tolling)

85
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,756
- What is it, Sylvia?
- A funeral.

86
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,048
(Bell continues tolling)

87
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:18,669
(Horses approaching)

88
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,960
Come on!

89
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:27,008
- Come on then. Whoa!
- (Man screams)

90
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,252
(Dog barks)

91
00:08:40,292 --> 00:08:41,509
Oh!

92
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,377
What the devil
do you think you're doing?

93
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,218
So the fox went that way, did it?

94
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,461
You'd better stay out of my sight,
young lady!

95
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,506
(Dog barks)

96
00:08:56,292 --> 00:08:58,215
How horrible.
They should be reported.

97
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,506
I expect they will be, my dear.

98
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,469
And no doubt those your ruffians
will say it was an accident.

99
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,674
- Is there anything we can do, Vicar?
- Yeah, you can keep away from us.

100
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:17,294
Please, it was not our fault!

101
00:09:17,417 --> 00:09:18,885
Leave us alone!

102
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,423
- But surely...
- I said leave us alone!

103
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,085
I know it wasn't your fault, my dear.

104
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,711
That was the poor lad's brother
in the coffin.

105
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,469
The Lord is punishing us
for our sins.

106
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:40,215
(Coachman) Whoa!

107
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,586
Oh, put the bags down there,
please, Coachman.

108
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,253
I'm sorry. The doctor isn't in.

109
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,174
- Alice?
- Who is it?

110
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:14,294
Alice, don't you remember me?

111
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,210
- Sylvia?
- Yes!

112
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,835
Oh, Sir James.

113
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:23,133
What a wonderful surprise.
Why didn't you let me know?

114
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,968
Well, come in.
Do come in.

115
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,835
Thank you.

116
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,754
- When did you arrive?
- We got here about half an hour ago.

117
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:45,379
Well, it’s nice seeing you again
Mrs Tompson.

118
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,049
- Oh, Father, call her Alice.
- Yes, please do.

119
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:49,919
Very well, Alice.

120
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,835
Hello, what's this?

121
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,086
It's nothing. it's just a cut.

122
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,836
- Well, I hope you're taking care of it.
- Oh, don't fuss so much.

123
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:01,424
Well, you can't be too careful
about these things.

124
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:03,294
Would you like me
to have a look at it?

125
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:05,465
It's all right.
My husband is a doctor.

126
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,378
Ah, yes. So they tell me.

127
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:12,052
- He is a very good doctor.
- Father is only joking, Alice.

128
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:14,886
Peter was his favourite pupil,
remember?

129
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,219
- Now, let me have a good look at you.
- No!

130
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,551
No, please don’t. I...

131
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:22,669
I look so untidy

132
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:28,090
Well, I don't know about that,

133
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,802
but you don't look too well to me.

134
00:11:30,917 --> 00:11:32,794
- Are you eating enough?
- Oh, Father, really!

135
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:34,794
Don't take any notice of him, Alice.

136
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,927
Oh, why didn't you let me know
you were coming?

137
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:40,919
I'm so sorry.
You must think me very inhospitable.

138
00:11:41,792 --> 00:11:43,965
No, not at all, my dear.

139
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,836
If it's inconvenient
we can always stay at the inn.

140
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:51,168
Oh, no. I wouldn't dream of it.
Of course you'll stay here.

141
00:11:51,292 --> 00:11:52,760
It's just that I...

142
00:11:53,417 --> 00:11:55,044
Well, the house isn't very clean.

143
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:01,302
Can I get you something?
Some tea?

144
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:03,385
We'd both love some.
Come on.

145
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,340
Kettle won't be a moment.

146
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:36,008
Hm. I suppose
there isn't anything stronger, is there?

147
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,923
Well, I'll ask,
but I don't expect...

148
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:40,090
Oh, don't worry.
I'll slip out later.

149
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:46,428
Well, where's that husband of yours?
Out on his rounds?

150
00:12:46,542 --> 00:12:47,919
Yes, I expect so.

151
00:12:48,042 --> 00:12:50,716
- Plenty of patients?
- Not as many as we'd like.

152
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,130
Oh, really?

153
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:56,135
There's been a lot of trouble.

154
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,256
What sort of trouble?

155
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,255
Oh, I...

156
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,253
I expect Peter would rather tell you
about it himself.

157
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,051
I'll see to the kettle. Excuse me.

158
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,878
You go and have a gossip
about your old school days.

159
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,298
I'll slip into the village
and see what I can find out.

160
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:19,636
All right, Father. Don't be long.

161
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:27,965
- Charlie.
- Aye, aye.

162
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:33,504
Will you have
a drink with me, Martinus?

163
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,923
Thank you, but I'll buy my own.

164
00:13:36,042 --> 00:13:37,589
Beer, Tom.

165
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:41,133
I... I did my best for him.

166
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,752
I'm sorry.

167
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:46,129
- Wasn't good enough, was it?
- Apparently not.

168
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:50,670
What do you think it were, Doctor?

169
00:13:50,792 --> 00:13:52,886
- That killed him?
- Aye, that killed him.

170
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,094
What was it that killed them all?

171
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,336
I don't know.

172
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:58,926
You don't know.

173
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,468
And you call yourself a doctor?

174
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:04,962
You won't let me find out.
If you let me carry out one post mortem.

175
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,632
It's no good cutting him up
after he's dead. It's too late.

176
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,253
- You're being ridiculous
- Ridiculous is it?

177
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,002
There's my brother lying dead
out there.

178
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:15,208
And twelve others like him. Twelve.

179
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,802
How long have you
been with us, Doctor?

180
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:20,170
Twelve months, isn't it?
That's one a month.

181
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:22,340
- Steady, Tom
- One a month.

182
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,256
Not a very good record, is it?

183
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,628
Are you trying to say
no one died before I came here?

184
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,593
At least we knew what they died from.

185
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,837
And if I was to tell you they died
from swamp fever or the plague

186
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,256
or some other nonsense,
would that make you happier?

187
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,969
- Yes, if it were the truth.
- Well, it wouldn't be the truth.

188
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:40,966
I'm not going to start telling
a lot of ridiculous lies

189
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,960
just to keep you people satisfied.

190
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,881
It's not good enough.

191
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,627
Oh, so we are not good enough
for you now?

192
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,128
- I didn't say that.
- it's what you meant, though.

193
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,837
Well, let me tell you something, Doctor.

194
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,505
You're not good enough for us.

195
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:58,128
Do you understand me?
You're not good enough!

196
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,049
- Ah, Doctor, there you are.
- Sir James!

197
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,503
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- (All) Good afternoon.

198
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:09,505
We've met before
in rather distressing circumstances.

199
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,593
May I now introduce myself?

200
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:15,212
Sir James Forbes, Professor
of Medicine at London University.

201
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:19,167
And this young man was
my cleverest and most able pupil.

202
00:15:19,292 --> 00:15:22,011
I hope you realise
how lucky you are to have him here.

203
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:27,254
Landlord, see these gentlemen
have a drink with me, will you?

204
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,423
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

205
00:15:29,542 --> 00:15:31,886
Come on, Peter,
are you ready?

206
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,802
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- (All) Good afternoon.

207
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,879
- Sir James, what are you doing here?
- You've lost weight, my boy.

208
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,002
- Alice not feeding you properly?
- Yes, but...

209
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,298
- Aren't you glad to see me?
- You've no idea.

210
00:15:46,417 --> 00:15:48,135
- Why have you come?
- You wrote to me.

211
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,378
It's very kind of you
to come all this way, sir.

212
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,502
I've just seen Alice.
She's not looking well.

213
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,798
Poor Alice.
I'm afraid she needs a holiday badly.

214
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:58,251
- You both do, by the look of you.
- Can't manage one at the moment, sir.

215
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,379
- You've no idea what it's been like.
- Well, we'll talk about it later,

216
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,583
without any of this hocus pocus
you put in your letter.

217
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,301
Ah!

218
00:16:11,292 --> 00:16:12,760
That was an excellent meal.

219
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,958
You girls are to be congratulated,
eh, Peter?

220
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,551
Oh, yes, Sir James. Indeed.

221
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:21,922
Still, what I always say is,
cooking is a science and not an art.

222
00:16:22,042 --> 00:16:23,510
If you get it right once

223
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:26,925
there's no earthly reason
why you shouldn't get it right every time.

224
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:32,001
Now, you girls run along to bed.
Peter and I will do the dishes

225
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,378
- But, Father, you can't...
- But Father, nothing.

226
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,753
You've had a long day
and I'm sure Alice is tired.

227
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,593
Yes, I am tired, it's true.

228
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,551
Good night, Peter. Father.

229
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,085
Good night, my dear.

230
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:51,295
It's so nice to see you again, Sir James.

231
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:54,626
Thank you, my dear.
it's nice to see you, too.

232
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,252
For you, Sir James?

233
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:09,010
No, thank you.

234
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:15,420
That's not the answer,
you know, Peter.

235
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,377
I know.

236
00:17:20,292 --> 00:17:21,509
I wish I knew the answer.

237
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:29,175
First of all, we have to decide
what the question is, don't we?

238
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,504
This disease seems to be
more mental than physical.

239
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,424
Yes, but you were
a little obscure, Peter.

240
00:17:36,542 --> 00:17:40,501
You said there was no attributable
cause for this mental affliction.

241
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:43,128
I'd like to Know a little more
about the symptoms.

242
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:47,335
- What about appetite?
- The patient show a loss of appetite.

243
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,085
Skin colour?

244
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,302
In every case a loss of skin colour, too.

245
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:53,636
- Reflexes?
- Retarding

246
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:58,426
Hm, like someone
in need of a holiday in fact, eh?

247
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:00,920
- You don't mean Alice, surely?
- Now, now, now.

248
00:18:01,042 --> 00:18:03,545
Don't let's jump to any conclusions.

249
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:06,716
- What did the autopsies show?
- I didn't make any.

250
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:10,087
You didn't make any?
What's come over you?

251
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:11,676
It is not permitted to make any.

252
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:13,965
- Well, who stopped you?
- The villagers.

253
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,256
They don't want the bodies
of their love ones cut about.

254
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,629
What about the coroner?
Surely he supported your applications?

255
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,969
- There isn't one.
- No coroner?

256
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,506
This isn't London, sir.

257
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:28,925
This is a Cornish village,
inhabited by simple country people

258
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:32,501
riddled with superstition
and all dominated by a Squire.

259
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:36,550
He acts as coroner and magistrate,
judge and jury.

260
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,673
And who is this jack of all trades?

261
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:43,254
Hamilton, sir. Squire Hamilton.

262
00:18:59,042 --> 00:19:01,170
Master?

263
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:03,511
Tonight. Tell the others.

264
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:06,469
They are not back
from the chase, Master.

265
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,086
Tell them to prepare
just as soon as they return.

266
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:20,511
I do hope you meet him, Sylvia.
He's such a charming man.

267
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,378
- Is he now?
- And so handsome.

268
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,174
- And rich.
- And unattached?

269
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,052
Yes. Yes, he is, as a matter of fact.

270
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,877
You're not trying to marry me off
by any chance?

271
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,210
Well, you could do a great deal worse.

272
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:38,761
He's got a lovely house
and a lot of money.

273
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,843
And what does Peter think?

274
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:45,464
He doesn't like him.

275
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:49,302
He thinks he's arrogant
and overbearing.

276
00:19:49,417 --> 00:19:52,216
But he's wrong. He is wrong.

277
00:19:54,542 --> 00:19:56,340
- Good night.
- Alice.

278
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,336
You're trying to tell me something else,
aren't you?

279
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:01,755
No!

280
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,003
No, I'm not, but I...

281
00:20:04,542 --> 00:20:07,466
- I must go.
- What did you say his name was again?

282
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,669
Clive Hamilton.

283
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:14,169
Goodnight, Sylvia.

284
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,218
(Plate breaks)

285
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,676
I'm sorry.

286
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:25,841
Don't apologise to me, dear boy.
It's your Crockery.

287
00:20:26,917 --> 00:20:29,921
Here, you'd better let me do the drying.

288
00:20:30,042 --> 00:20:32,295
- I really do need a drink.
- Rubbish.

289
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,256
What you need
is an end to your worries.

290
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:38,094
So far we've nothing to start on,
nothing to help us at all.

291
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,676
I know.

292
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:44,004
We must have a body to examine.
We can't possibly work without one.

293
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,503
If you’re thinking
of applying for an exhumation...

294
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:49,378
Apply for nothing.
We'll dig one up.

295
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,006
- We'll what?
- Dig one up.

296
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,503
That lad they buried today will do.
Nice and fresh.

297
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,127
Then we might learn something.

298
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,799
- But we can’t just go out and start...
- We’ll do it tonight.

299
00:20:59,917 --> 00:21:02,136
There's a full moon.
Couldn't be better.

300
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,672
We'll start off about midnight.

301
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:05,339
(Plate crashes)

302
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:07,964
(Door closes)

303
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:18,675
Alice.

304
00:21:39,042 --> 00:21:40,464
(Dogs bark in the distance)

305
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:22,172
Alice!

306
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:14,877
Alice?

307
00:23:16,292 --> 00:23:18,294
Is that you Alice?
Aah!

308
00:23:18,417 --> 00:23:20,636
Wait a minute. I know you.

309
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:22,926
I know you!

310
00:23:23,042 --> 00:23:24,339
(Panting)

311
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,005
(Man) Come on.

312
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:29,089
Oh!

313
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:37,883
Oh!

314
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,422
Ah.

315
00:23:39,542 --> 00:23:41,215
Oh, oh.

316
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:43,131
- Go away!
- (Horse neighs)

317
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:45,839
(Horse neighs)

318
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,301
(Screams)

319
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,673
Oh, no. No!

320
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:22,090
Hey, Tom. Get her off!

321
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:25,337
(Gasps) Oh, let me go!

322
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:28,177
Leave me alone. Oh, oh!

323
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:29,760
- (Man) Come on.
- Let go!

324
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:34,844
Let me go! Let me go!

325
00:24:36,292 --> 00:24:38,260
(She gasps)

326
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:46,044
- Catch.
- Catch.

327
00:24:46,167 --> 00:24:48,261
(He laughs)
(Sylvia gasps)

328
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:53,710
Oh!

329
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:55,460
(She sobs)

330
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,877
(Gasps)

331
00:25:12,917 --> 00:25:14,794
What's it to be, lads?
Aces high?

332
00:25:14,917 --> 00:25:16,794
(Men) Aces high.

333
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:20,335
Cut.

334
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:23,051
(Gasps)

335
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:32,799
Ten of spades, four of diamonds,
Jack of clubs

336
00:25:32,917 --> 00:25:34,919
Jack of hearts.

337
00:25:35,042 --> 00:25:37,044
- Let her go.
- (Groans)

338
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:39,335
King of hearts.

339
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:41,335
(Sobbing)

340
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,506
Very appropriate.

341
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:51,219
Don't... Don't touch me.

342
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:54,177
- Don't you dare touch me.
- Come on, little fox.

343
00:25:54,292 --> 00:25:55,919
Go to ground.

344
00:25:56,042 --> 00:25:57,794
Leave her alone!

345
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,253
(Gasps)

346
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,343
Get out of my sight, the lot of you.

347
00:26:15,458 --> 00:26:16,505
Get out!

348
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:19,835
Get out!

349
00:26:22,167 --> 00:26:23,840
(Sobbing)

350
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,294
Miss Forbes...

351
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:31,217
I know that it is useless to ask you
to forgive my friends.

352
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:34,792
Such behaviour is beneath contempt
and beyond forgiveness.

353
00:26:34,917 --> 00:26:36,965
I only ask
that you accept my solemn word

354
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:39,802
that I knew nothing
of what was going on.

355
00:26:39,917 --> 00:26:41,919
How do you know my name?

356
00:26:42,042 --> 00:26:44,170
The arrival in as small a village as this

357
00:26:44,292 --> 00:26:47,341
of a beautiful young lady
and her distinguished father

358
00:26:47,458 --> 00:26:49,631
could scarcely go unnoticed,
Miss Forbes.

359
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:53,209
My name is Hamilton,
Clive Hamilton.

360
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:56,336
Will you kindly take me home,
Mr Hamilton?

361
00:26:56,458 --> 00:26:58,586
I fear you have not forgiven me yet.

362
00:26:58,708 --> 00:27:01,837
Your fears are well founded,
Mr Hamilton. I have not.

363
00:27:01,958 --> 00:27:04,461
Now, will you take me home
or do I have to walk?

364
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,879
Is there nothing I can do to persuade
you of my personal innocence?

365
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,924
Nothing.
I take it, then, I have to walk?

366
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:16,801
My carriage is at your disposal.

367
00:27:16,917 --> 00:27:19,045
Unfortunately,
I can't leave at this moment

368
00:27:19,167 --> 00:27:21,215
but I shall instruct
one of my young guests...

369
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:24,416
- Thank you. I prefer to walk.
- Miss Forbes, you can't walk.

370
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:27,216
You might be attacked, Miss Forbes.

371
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:29,335
I've already been attacked.

372
00:27:29,458 --> 00:27:30,880
And it was here in your house.

373
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,344
Now, please open the door.

374
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,002
Thank you.

375
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:46,004
And tomorrow I shall go
straight to the police.

376
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:49,129
- Please don't do that, Miss Forbes.
- Why shouldn't I?

377
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:52,548
I am the Squire of this little community

378
00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:55,261
and responsible
for the welfare of everyone in it.

379
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:57,173
Should any scandal attach
to my name,

380
00:27:57,292 --> 00:28:00,216
the effect could be disastrous
for all these people.

381
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:02,802
I can't expect you to understand
why that should be.

382
00:28:02,917 --> 00:28:04,794
I just ask that you believe it.

383
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,627
And what about those...

384
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,172
...your charming young guests?

385
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:12,927
Will you leave me to punish them
in the way I think most fit?

386
00:28:13,042 --> 00:28:14,965
I promise they'll suffer
for what they've done.

387
00:28:15,542 --> 00:28:17,419
Or would have done.

388
00:28:17,542 --> 00:28:19,294
If it hadn't been for you.

389
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:22,676
Yes, that's true, I suppose.

390
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:25,044
Very well, Mr Hamilton.

391
00:28:25,167 --> 00:28:26,419
I won't go to the police.

392
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:29,344
- This time.
- Thank you.

393
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,005
Are you sure you can find the way?

394
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:35,129
Thank you, Mr Hamilton.
Good night.

395
00:28:35,917 --> 00:28:38,295
Please take great care
not to stray from the path.

396
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:42,467
There are tin mines under this land .The ground sometimes subsides.

397
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:04,132
Denver!

398
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:12,502
Everything is ready, Master.

399
00:30:31,417 --> 00:30:33,340
. Ah.
. (Laughs)

400
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:42,709
Alice.

401
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,547
Alice!

402
00:30:48,042 --> 00:30:49,794
(Gasps)

403
00:31:10,542 --> 00:31:12,419
Good evening, Officer.

404
00:31:12,542 --> 00:31:16,297
You just step up here a moment,
gentlemen, please.

405
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,386
I... I realise this looks...

406
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,504
it's a serious charge
you'll be on in the morning.

407
00:31:23,417 --> 00:31:24,885
What charge?

408
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,173
Who might this gentleman be?

409
00:31:28,292 --> 00:31:30,715
Sir James Forbes.

410
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:32,756
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

411
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:34,502
What are you going to charge us with?

412
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:38,506
Body snatching I should think, sir.

413
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:41,002
I see.

414
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:45,553
Well, in that case I suppose...

415
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:47,590
you don't mind if we have a quick look.

416
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:49,631
I don't care who you are, sir!

417
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:52,544
Well.

418
00:31:52,667 --> 00:31:54,761
What's going on, sir?

419
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:02,131
I don't know, Sergeant,
any more than you do.

420
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:08,173
Now, look, Sergeant, I need your help.

421
00:32:08,292 --> 00:32:09,509
My help, sir?

422
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:11,798
Say nothing of what
you've seen here tonight.

423
00:32:11,917 --> 00:32:14,136
Now look, Sergeant,
it doesn't need me to tell you

424
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,378
there's something very wrong
in this village.

425
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,719
All these young men dying
and now this.

426
00:32:18,833 --> 00:32:21,837
Well, some people say
it is the marsh fever, sir.

427
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:23,380
Oh, marsh fiddlesticks.

428
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:27,130
In any case, it couldn't cause a body
to disappear into thin air, could it?

429
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,925
- No, sir.
- Well, then, will you help me or not?

430
00:32:31,042 --> 00:32:34,171
I'd like to help you, sir. Really I would.

431
00:32:34,292 --> 00:32:38,092
My boy was one of the first to go, sir.

432
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:40,461
Well, then, help me for his sake.

433
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,423
Very well, sir.
I'll withhold my report for 48 hours.

434
00:32:44,542 --> 00:32:45,885
I dare not do more than that.

435
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,173
Thank you, Sergeant.

436
00:32:48,292 --> 00:32:50,420
You won't regret it. I'm sure of that.

437
00:32:50,542 --> 00:32:52,340
What are we going to do about this, sir?

438
00:32:52,458 --> 00:32:55,007
We'll fill it in, make it look
as if it's never been touched.

439
00:32:55,125 --> 00:32:56,877
We can manage this on our own,
Sir James.

440
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,968
Why don't you wait inside
where it's warm.

441
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:03,213
Thank you, Peter.
Yes, I will.

442
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:05,210
- Good night, Sergeant
- Good night, sir.

443
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:08,256
Right-ho, let's get on with it.

444
00:33:32,792 --> 00:33:34,339
Sylvia?

445
00:33:52,958 --> 00:33:55,006
Have you seen Alice?
She's not in her room.

446
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,002
Come in, Peter, and sit down.

447
00:33:58,125 --> 00:34:00,344
- Sit?
- Please sit down.

448
00:34:06,292 --> 00:34:08,670
I have some shocking news
for you Peter.

449
00:34:08,792 --> 00:34:11,261
- What is it?
- Alice.

450
00:34:13,125 --> 00:34:15,469
Then she was ill.

451
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:17,051
- I must go tell her.
- Wait.

452
00:34:17,167 --> 00:34:18,794
- I have to see her.
- She's not here.

453
00:34:18,917 --> 00:34:21,386
- Where is she?
- Control yourself, Peter.

454
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,798
She's not here.
Now, listen to me.

455
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:27,921
She's outside somewhere,
on the moors.

456
00:34:31,167 --> 00:34:32,339
She's dead.

457
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:36,756
No.

458
00:34:38,125 --> 00:34:39,672
Sylvia found her.

459
00:34:41,375 --> 00:34:42,592
No.

460
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:44,551
(Sobbing) No.

461
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:50,131
Oh, God.

462
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,798
Forgive me.

463
00:34:58,458 --> 00:34:59,880
I killed her.

464
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,335
- That’s not true. You know it isn’t.
- Yes, it’s my fault.

465
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:08,757
- I should have known.
- That's nonsense, Peter.

466
00:35:10,583 --> 00:35:13,302
If she's been struck by this disease,
it's no fault of yours.

467
00:35:14,542 --> 00:35:17,625
Take me to her, wherever she is.

468
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:21,051
Yes, I will, Peter. I will.

469
00:35:21,875 --> 00:35:23,673
But there's one thing we have to do.

470
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:28,587
We must find out about the disease,
find out what it is and destroy it.

471
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:33,048
You will have to let me
perform an autopsy.

472
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:37,132
- God.
- We have to, Peter.

473
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,593
And I shall need your help.

474
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,719
- I'm ready, Father.
- Yes, very well.

475
00:35:46,667 --> 00:35:48,840
We'll ask the sergeant to come with us.

476
00:36:04,917 --> 00:36:06,385
- Hey, Martinus.
- Heh?

477
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,923
Come on, wake up!
Come on, let's have a word with you.

478
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:14,172
(Screams)

479
00:36:16,833 --> 00:36:17,925
No!

480
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:37,710
Extraordinary.

481
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:40,552
- No sign of rigor mortis.
- Hm.

482
00:36:52,958 --> 00:36:54,301
When did she do this?

483
00:36:54,417 --> 00:36:57,170
- Some days ago.
- How?

484
00:36:57,292 --> 00:37:00,262
Piece of glass, I think.
She was rather secretive about it.

485
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:01,877
- Oh?
- It was a clean wound.

486
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:05,380
(Sighs)

487
00:37:47,917 --> 00:37:49,464
Well?

488
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:50,926
It's not human.

489
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,252
- it's not human blood.
- Exactly.

490
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:56,753
She's been splashed
with the blood of some animal.

491
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:59,003
Do you think
she might have been attacked?

492
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:00,877
By an animal?

493
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,129
There are no external signs of violence.
None at all.

494
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,968
Then how did she die?

495
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:08,802
That's what we are trying
to find out, Peter.

496
00:38:09,917 --> 00:38:11,669
How did she die?

497
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:20,424
Stop it!
I can't stand any more.

498
00:38:20,542 --> 00:38:23,421
It's not a matter of what you can
or can't stand, my lad.

499
00:38:23,542 --> 00:38:27,501
- it's the truth that matters, the truth.
- I'm telling you the truth.

500
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:30,094
- Look, Jack.
- Sergeant.

501
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:32,381
Sergeant.
Look, I was up there.

502
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,719
You saw me
so it's no use my denying it.

503
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:38,667
And she... And the body was found
right by me, all right.

504
00:38:38,792 --> 00:38:41,591
But I didn't kill her. I didn’t kill her!

505
00:38:41,708 --> 00:38:45,087
So you say, but you was drunk.

506
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:48,007
And so I'll go on saying,
because it's the truth.

507
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,798
All right.

508
00:38:49,917 --> 00:38:51,840
What was you doing up there, anyway?

509
00:38:51,958 --> 00:38:56,043
I told you. I'd just had a skinful.
I don't know why I went up there.

510
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,794
Just to get away from everything.

511
00:38:57,917 --> 00:38:59,919
Are you sure you didn't see her?

512
00:39:00,042 --> 00:39:02,261
- And follow her into the woods?
- No!

513
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:05,629
You'd had a row with her husband.
There's plenty who'll swear to that.

514
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:08,219
Now, I put it to you
that you wanted your revenge.

515
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:11,542
- So you saw her and followed her...
- No, I tell you, no!

516
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:16,720
- Is that the truth?
- Yeah, it is.

517
00:39:17,917 --> 00:39:19,294
I'm sure of that, at least.

518
00:39:19,417 --> 00:39:22,296
What do you mean by that, "at least"'?

519
00:39:23,125 --> 00:39:25,048
What do you mean by it?

520
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:27,135
You wouldn't believe me, anyway.

521
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:29,753
You leave that to me to decide.

522
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:32,253
You saw something else up there,
didn't you?

523
00:39:33,208 --> 00:39:35,461
What was it? What was it?

524
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,755
My brother.

525
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:42,128
- You saw your...
- My brother, yes. The one that's dead!

526
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,968
The one that's buried out there.

527
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:46,051
I saw him just as clear
as I see you now.

528
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:49,046
All grey, his eyes staring.

529
00:39:49,167 --> 00:39:51,420
I saw him.

530
00:39:51,542 --> 00:39:54,045
And yet I know he's out there,
lying in his coffin.

531
00:39:57,708 --> 00:39:59,210
Nothing.

532
00:40:00,292 --> 00:40:01,919
Absolutely nothing.

533
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:09,469
Peter, you'd better go up
and get some rest.

534
00:40:09,583 --> 00:40:11,381
You've been on your feet for 24 hours.

535
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,800
I can't rest. I'll just go and make
all the arrangements for the funeral.

536
00:40:14,917 --> 00:40:16,339
- (Knock at the door)
- Yes?

537
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:20,261
- Excuse me, sir.
- What is it, Sergeant?

538
00:40:22,417 --> 00:40:24,636
The front door was open
so I took the liberty...

539
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:27,094
Well, what is it?

540
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:30,291
- it's young Martinus, sir.
- What about him?

541
00:40:30,417 --> 00:40:31,885
You should have a word with him.

542
00:40:34,875 --> 00:40:36,468
Oh, very well.

543
00:40:37,542 --> 00:40:40,967
I did see him, sir. I swear it.

544
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:43,757
Everything I told the sergeant
is the truth.

545
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:45,673
I'm telling you, sir.

546
00:40:48,917 --> 00:40:51,215
I did see him, sir.
I saw my brother.

547
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:53,801
Your brother is dead and buried.

548
00:40:53,917 --> 00:40:57,217
I know that, sir.
Didn't I bury him myself?

549
00:40:57,333 --> 00:40:59,256
But I saw him in his shroud.

550
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:03,005
- Standing, staring at me.
- How could you see him?

551
00:41:03,917 --> 00:41:06,295
God only knows, sir.
But I saw him.

552
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:10,210
God only knows, indeed.

553
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:15,048
That's all, Sergeant.

554
00:41:15,167 --> 00:41:17,886
You don't believe me, do you, sir?

555
00:41:19,042 --> 00:41:21,636
On the contrary,
I believe everything you say.

556
00:41:32,583 --> 00:41:35,587
Well, are you satisfied now, Sergeant?

557
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:37,051
No.

558
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:41,377
- You just heard the gentleman say...
- I know what the gentleman said.

559
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,423
But I'm the law here.

560
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:47,672
And I'm responsible for you until
I have made further investigations.

561
00:41:47,792 --> 00:41:49,635
Put him in the cell, Constable.

562
00:42:26,542 --> 00:42:27,964
(Gasps)

563
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:29,630
Father.

564
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:32,424
Feeling better, my dear?

565
00:42:32,542 --> 00:42:34,385
Feeling well enough to talk?

566
00:42:37,208 --> 00:42:40,542
Now, when you told me about Alice,
you said there was a man with her.

567
00:42:41,542 --> 00:42:43,340
Did you recognise him?

568
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:45,752
No.

569
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,047
You remember the young man we saw

570
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:51,261
who was following
the funeral procession,

571
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:52,968
the one who shouted at us to go away?

572
00:42:54,125 --> 00:42:55,502
Yes.

573
00:42:55,625 --> 00:42:58,595
- He's been arrested.
- But it wasn't him.

574
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:01,419
But you said
you didn't recognise the man.

575
00:43:01,542 --> 00:43:02,714
(Gasps)

576
00:43:04,375 --> 00:43:07,424
Is it possible that the man you saw

577
00:43:07,542 --> 00:43:09,886
was the man in the coffin?

578
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,923
It was, wasn't it?

579
00:43:12,958 --> 00:43:15,211
But how?

580
00:43:15,333 --> 00:43:16,801
Never mind how, my dear.

581
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:20,048
Just one more question
and then you can rest.

582
00:43:20,167 --> 00:43:21,589
When we found Alice

583
00:43:21,708 --> 00:43:25,258
was she in the same place
where you saw her with this man?

584
00:43:26,583 --> 00:43:28,836
No, no she wasn't.

585
00:43:28,958 --> 00:43:31,802
It was up by some old mine works.
I don't Know exactly where.

586
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:37,176
Well, I'll try to find them.
You go back to sleep.

587
00:43:37,292 --> 00:43:40,375
No, I'll be getting up in a few minutes.
Thank you, Father.

588
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:43,343
Very well.

589
00:43:52,708 --> 00:43:54,051
Ah, Peter.

590
00:43:54,167 --> 00:43:57,046
- How is she?
- Oh, very much better.

591
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:59,465
She's talking of getting up.

592
00:43:59,583 --> 00:44:02,336
Well, I feel like a stroll.
Care to join me?

593
00:44:02,458 --> 00:44:03,880
Yes.

594
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,628
I want a word with the sergeant
so we'll call in on the way.

595
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:08,627
Where are we going, sir?

596
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:10,752
Up on the moors.

597
00:44:10,875 --> 00:44:13,003
A breath of air will do us both good.

598
00:44:31,875 --> 00:44:33,877
I didn't know this place even existed.

599
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,468
What did they mine here?

600
00:44:36,583 --> 00:44:37,926
- Tin, sir.
- Tin?

601
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:41,091
Yes, there's a rich vein
runs under here sir, worth a fortune.

602
00:44:41,208 --> 00:44:43,882
Then why has it been allowed
to fall into decay like this?

603
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,627
There was a lot of accidents, sir.

604
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,798
Miners killed and maimed.

605
00:44:47,917 --> 00:44:50,591
They wouldn't go down there.
They said it was unlucky.

606
00:44:50,708 --> 00:44:53,882
Old Squire was furious,
but he had to shut it down.

607
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,673
Has young Hamilton tried to reopen it?

608
00:44:55,792 --> 00:44:58,341
Oh, no, sir, but then
he don't need the money.

609
00:44:58,458 --> 00:45:01,462
- Where does he get his money from?
- I can't rightly say, sir.

610
00:45:01,583 --> 00:45:05,292
He was away
when his father died in foreign parts.

611
00:45:05,417 --> 00:45:08,626
The old squire left him the house
and a lot of unpaid bills.

612
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,343
When young Squire come back here,

613
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:12,802
he shut himself up there,
wouldn't see nobody.

614
00:45:12,917 --> 00:45:15,966
Then suddenly he had a lot
of young people down staying there

615
00:45:16,083 --> 00:45:18,211
and spending money like water.

616
00:45:20,167 --> 00:45:21,885
It's creepy.

617
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,129
- They do say, sir, that it's...
- What do they say, Sergeant?

618
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:28,174
- That it's haunted?
- Well, how did you know that, sir?

619
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:30,090
It doesn't take much guessing, does it?

620
00:45:30,208 --> 00:45:33,052
Come on, Peter, we mustn't leave
Sylvia alone too long.

621
00:45:33,167 --> 00:45:34,635
Thank you, Sergeant.

622
00:45:36,917 --> 00:45:38,339
(Knock on door)

623
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:50,128
- May I come in?
- Please.

624
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:53,460
Thank you.

625
00:45:57,292 --> 00:45:59,215
What can I do for you?

626
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:01,961
At our last meeting
you made it abundantly clear

627
00:46:02,083 --> 00:46:04,677
that my attentions
would not be welcomed,

628
00:46:04,792 --> 00:46:07,420
that you would as soon
never see me again.

629
00:46:07,542 --> 00:46:10,386
I appreciate your feelings
and the reason for them.

630
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,925
I wouldn't dream of imposing
myself on you, only...

631
00:46:14,042 --> 00:46:18,001
Only I felt I had to come
and tell you how terribly sorry I was

632
00:46:18,125 --> 00:46:20,674
to hear the news of your friend,
Alice Tompson.

633
00:46:20,792 --> 00:46:22,794
I knew her, you know, not very well

634
00:46:22,917 --> 00:46:26,876
but enough to realise
what a very fine lady she was.

635
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,799
Please accept my sincere condolences.

636
00:46:29,917 --> 00:46:33,501
Thank you, but would they not be better
given to her husband?

637
00:46:33,625 --> 00:46:36,253
I fear they would not be accepted,
Miss Forbes.

638
00:46:36,375 --> 00:46:39,345
- Oh?
- Doctor Tompson doesn't like me.

639
00:46:39,458 --> 00:46:41,586
You are not alone in your opinion of me.

640
00:46:41,708 --> 00:46:46,043
I can't imagine that the opinion
of others affects you very much.

641
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,798
Oh, I should like to be popular,
of course.

642
00:46:48,917 --> 00:46:51,761
I should be lying if I said otherwise.

643
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:56,301
But I realised long ago that
in order to be popular one must conform.

644
00:46:56,417 --> 00:46:58,385
I find that too big a price to pay.

645
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,298
Conform?

646
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:04,752
Well, to the standards of conduct
dictated by convention.

647
00:47:04,875 --> 00:47:07,754
I have my own standards.
I conform to them.

648
00:47:07,875 --> 00:47:09,593
At least you are honest, Mr Hamilton.

649
00:47:09,708 --> 00:47:11,506
Probably my only virtue.

650
00:47:12,375 --> 00:47:14,377
(Laughs) I'm always honest,
even with myself.

651
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,969
I wonder how many people
can truthfully admit to that.

652
00:47:17,083 --> 00:47:18,460
Not many, I agree.

653
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:21,757
I am becoming a bore.
I have taken up enough of your time.

654
00:47:21,875 --> 00:47:23,877
Oh, I wonder,

655
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,628
could I impose on you
for a glass of water?

656
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:29,469
Oh, yes of course.
Unless you prefer sherry?

657
00:47:29,583 --> 00:47:31,631
Please, I don't want
to put you to any trouble.

658
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:33,297
It's no trouble.

659
00:47:38,375 --> 00:47:40,469
Do you believe in life after death,
Miss Forbes?

660
00:47:42,625 --> 00:47:45,504
- That's an odd question.
- Odd?

661
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:50,218
To ask a stranger.

662
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:52,802
I was hoping that
you no longer considered me a stranger.

663
00:47:56,250 --> 00:48:00,255
Very well.
Yes, I do believe in life after death.

664
00:48:01,917 --> 00:48:03,510
Do you?

665
00:48:06,792 --> 00:48:08,510
I'm sure of it, Miss Forbes.

666
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,673
- (Glass breaks)
- I'm sorry.

667
00:48:19,917 --> 00:48:21,715
- Here, let me...
- Oh!

668
00:48:23,292 --> 00:48:25,465
How clumsy of me. I'm so sorry.

669
00:48:25,583 --> 00:48:27,426
It's nothing, really.

670
00:48:29,917 --> 00:48:31,965
This should prevent
the risk of any infection.

671
00:48:32,833 --> 00:48:34,927
You must think me a clumsy idiot.

672
00:48:35,042 --> 00:48:36,794
I really do apologise.

673
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:45,835
One cannot be too careful.

674
00:48:52,792 --> 00:48:54,465
There. Is that better?

675
00:48:54,583 --> 00:48:57,211
- Thank you.
- A safety pin should hold it.

676
00:48:57,333 --> 00:48:59,210
I have one in my bag.

677
00:49:09,667 --> 00:49:11,169
Allow me.

678
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:22,583
May I say that I consider you
to be a very brave young lady.

679
00:49:22,708 --> 00:49:24,631
Because of this?

680
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:26,718
Because of everything, Miss Forbes.

681
00:49:29,875 --> 00:49:31,468
I'll see myself out.

682
00:49:44,292 --> 00:49:46,670
(Drum beats)

683
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,594
(Drum beats intensify)

684
00:51:07,583 --> 00:51:09,426
it's the Master. Open.

685
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,962
(Vicar) Man that is born of woman
hath but a short time to live

686
00:52:11,083 --> 00:52:12,835
and is full of misery.

687
00:52:12,958 --> 00:52:15,256
He cometh up
and he is cut down like a flower.

688
00:52:16,417 --> 00:52:20,217
He fleeth, as it were, a shadow
and never continueth in one stay.

689
00:52:21,125 --> 00:52:23,878
In the midst of life we are in death.

690
00:52:42,375 --> 00:52:43,968
Yet, O Lord God most holy,

691
00:52:44,083 --> 00:52:46,302
O Lord God most mighty,

692
00:52:46,417 --> 00:52:48,636
O holy and most merciful Saviour,

693
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:52,129
deliver us not into the bitter pains
of eternal death.

694
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:54,298
(Drum beats)

695
00:53:02,375 --> 00:53:04,594
O holy and merciful Saviour,

696
00:53:04,708 --> 00:53:07,211
Thou most worthy judge eternal,

697
00:53:07,333 --> 00:53:09,381
suffer us not at our last hour

698
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,502
for any pains of death

699
00:53:11,625 --> 00:53:14,378
to fall from Thee...

700
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:17,583
(Bell tolling)

701
00:53:20,833 --> 00:53:24,292
...for as much as it has pleased
almighty God in his great mercy

702
00:53:24,417 --> 00:53:29,423
to take unto Himself the soul
of our dear sister here departed.

703
00:53:35,625 --> 00:53:39,175
Vicar, may I ask a favour of you?

704
00:53:39,292 --> 00:53:42,375
I am given to understand
that you have a fine collection of books

705
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,093
on a variety of subjects.

706
00:53:44,208 --> 00:53:47,178
I wonder if you have any
on witchcraft or black magic.

707
00:53:47,292 --> 00:53:50,671
If so, may I have the use
of your library?

708
00:53:50,792 --> 00:53:52,590
- Come with me.
- Thank you.

709
00:54:16,833 --> 00:54:19,211
Come in, sir.

710
00:54:19,333 --> 00:54:21,085
No, no, please sit down.

711
00:54:21,208 --> 00:54:23,006
Oh, hello, Peter.

712
00:54:24,667 --> 00:54:26,169
Peter...

713
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,343
Have you ever heard of voodoo?

714
00:54:29,458 --> 00:54:33,088
- it's a form of witchcraft, isn't it?
- Exactly.

715
00:54:33,208 --> 00:54:36,667
It's practiced in the Caribbean,
in Haiti to be precise.

716
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:39,460
Please sit down, Vicar.

717
00:54:41,083 --> 00:54:44,462
I find all kinds of witchcraft
slightly nauseating

718
00:54:44,583 --> 00:54:47,757
and this I find absolutely disgusting.

719
00:54:48,792 --> 00:54:51,341
You're not following
and there's no reason why you should

720
00:54:51,458 --> 00:54:53,301
if I don't explain properly.

721
00:54:53,417 --> 00:54:56,626
- Unless you would like to...
- No, I'm ignorant in these matters.

722
00:54:57,708 --> 00:54:59,756
Oh, well.

723
00:54:59,875 --> 00:55:02,924
Sylvia tells us that
she saw something on the moors,

724
00:55:03,042 --> 00:55:07,627
something that was a man
and yet not a man.

725
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:11,459
Her description
was of a walking corpse,

726
00:55:11,583 --> 00:55:14,382
the corpse of Martinus' brother.

727
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,047
Now...

728
00:55:17,167 --> 00:55:21,502
...young Martinus also says
that he saw something on the moor,

729
00:55:21,625 --> 00:55:24,799
something that he insists
was his brother.

730
00:55:24,917 --> 00:55:27,591
But we know that his brother is dead.

731
00:55:27,708 --> 00:55:30,052
We also know
that he is not lying in his coffin.

732
00:55:31,375 --> 00:55:32,877
Now, what do you make of that?

733
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,843
That he was buried alive,

734
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:37,507
that he somehow freed himself
and he's out there.

735
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:40,595
But I've told you, Peter, I saw him.

736
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:44,379
And he was as dead then
as any corpse I have ever seen.

737
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:45,968
No, that's not the answer.

738
00:55:46,083 --> 00:55:49,292
Then, what is?
What is the connection with voodoo?

739
00:55:51,417 --> 00:55:55,172
Someone in this village
is practicing witchcraft.

740
00:55:55,292 --> 00:55:57,670
That corpse wandering
on the moors is...

741
00:55:58,917 --> 00:56:01,511
...an undead, a zombie.

742
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:04,510
It's incredible, sir.

743
00:56:04,625 --> 00:56:07,879
How can you, a man of science,
believe that?

744
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,970
I have an advantage
over you there, Peter.

745
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:14,383
I spent the afternoon reading up
the subject in the vicar's library.

746
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,002
And it's all there.

747
00:56:16,125 --> 00:56:19,584
It's all clearly scientifically stated.

748
00:56:19,708 --> 00:56:22,917
And we have the evidence
of two sensible human beings.

749
00:56:23,042 --> 00:56:24,965
What can be done?

750
00:56:25,083 --> 00:56:27,461
About Martinus' brother? Nothing.

751
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,127
I'm thinking of Alice.

752
00:56:34,042 --> 00:56:36,340
- Are you saying that Alice is...?
- Peter, I am.

753
00:56:38,125 --> 00:56:40,048
I pray that I'm wrong.

754
00:56:40,167 --> 00:56:43,717
But I’m going to watch over her grave tonight with the vicar until daybreak.

755
00:56:45,208 --> 00:56:47,085
I'll come, too.

756
00:56:48,667 --> 00:56:51,841
I’d rather you didn’t.
I think you need some rest.,

757
00:56:52,792 --> 00:56:55,671
- I am rested, sir.
- Well, I'm...

758
00:56:55,792 --> 00:56:58,545
If anything were to happen,
I'd rather you weren't there.

759
00:56:58,667 --> 00:57:00,419
I'm coming with you.

760
00:57:03,125 --> 00:57:04,627
Very well.

761
00:57:22,833 --> 00:57:24,881
- Vicar?
- What?

762
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,173
I think you should go home now.
it's very late.

763
00:57:27,292 --> 00:57:29,340
Dr Tompson and I will stay on.

764
00:57:29,458 --> 00:57:31,506
- If you're sure.
- Yes, yes. Quite sure.

765
00:57:31,625 --> 00:57:33,343
All right.

766
00:57:33,458 --> 00:57:35,381
- Good night, Sir James.
- Good night.

767
00:57:45,875 --> 00:57:47,502
(Drum beats)

768
00:57:58,458 --> 00:58:00,085
(Drum beats intensify)

769
00:58:39,708 --> 00:58:41,005
What happened?

770
00:58:41,125 --> 00:58:43,594
- Who attacked you?
- I don't know.

771
00:58:43,708 --> 00:58:45,381
He wore a mask.

772
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,047
We'll take you home.

773
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:49,215
(Drum beats)

774
00:59:01,417 --> 00:59:04,921
I shall be all right now, thank you.
If you should need me...

775
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:07,090
Don't worry.
We won't hesitate to call you.

776
00:59:07,208 --> 00:59:08,755
Thank you, Sir James.

777
00:59:15,417 --> 00:59:17,715
We must get back.
This may have been a trick.

778
00:59:25,833 --> 00:59:27,506
(Footsteps)

779
01:00:24,792 --> 01:00:26,044
Zombie.

780
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,252
(Screams)

781
01:03:42,125 --> 01:03:43,672
- Oh.
- Peter?

782
01:03:44,583 --> 01:03:47,132
Peter, it's all right.
it's all right now.

783
01:03:48,125 --> 01:03:49,672
You had a nightmare.

784
01:03:51,708 --> 01:03:53,927
A nightmare?

785
01:03:55,208 --> 01:03:57,336
Then, it wasn't Alice?

786
01:03:58,250 --> 01:04:00,503
I'm afraid that part of it was true.

787
01:04:00,625 --> 01:04:03,174
You fainted
and we brought you back here.

788
01:04:04,333 --> 01:04:05,880
And Alice?

789
01:04:07,125 --> 01:04:08,843
Reburied properly.

790
01:04:10,042 --> 01:04:11,544
The vicar gave her absolution.

791
01:04:11,667 --> 01:04:14,090
She will be at peace now.

792
01:04:14,208 --> 01:04:17,417
Peace? Is there such a thing?

793
01:04:18,333 --> 01:04:21,132
There will be, my son,
and with God's help

794
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:24,129
and the energy of your good friend,
I am sure of it.

795
01:04:25,125 --> 01:04:27,719
Well, I must get back to my church now.

796
01:04:27,833 --> 01:04:29,380
Thank you for your help, Vicar.

797
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:32,879
It is I who should be thanking you.
I shall pray for you both.

798
01:04:42,667 --> 01:04:44,761
Would you care to tell me
about your dream?

799
01:04:44,875 --> 01:04:46,468
It sometimes helps.

800
01:04:47,833 --> 01:04:50,916
I dreamed I saw the dead rise.

801
01:04:52,208 --> 01:04:56,042
All the graves in the churchyard opened
and the dead came out.

802
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:01,253
All the graves were empty.

803
01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:13,049
In heaven's name, where are they?
What's happened to them, sir?

804
01:05:17,875 --> 01:05:20,674
It is essential that none of the villagers
should know of this.

805
01:05:20,792 --> 01:05:23,796
We must get these graves filled in
before anyone is astir.

806
01:05:23,917 --> 01:05:25,510
Very good, sir.

807
01:05:35,125 --> 01:05:38,880
Sergeant, I want another word
with your prisoner, young Martinus.

808
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,004
- You want to see him right away, sir?
- Yes, immediately.

809
01:05:58,625 --> 01:06:00,252
He's got away, Sergeant!

810
01:06:00,375 --> 01:06:02,127
Anyone can see that.
The question is how?

811
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:06,300
The question is, where did he go?
Has he joined the others?

812
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:10,674
- The others?
- You know what I mean.

813
01:06:11,375 --> 01:06:13,423
But he's not dead, sir.

814
01:06:14,208 --> 01:06:16,131
Not yet, Sergeant.

815
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:18,378
But he soon will be.

816
01:06:21,167 --> 01:06:23,386
Did the prisoner
have any visitors yesterday?

817
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:26,299
- Well, did he?
- Er... No, sir.

818
01:06:26,417 --> 01:06:27,714
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

819
01:06:27,833 --> 01:06:30,803
Well, only the squire, that is.

820
01:06:30,917 --> 01:06:34,000
- What did he want?
- He wanted a word with the prisoner.

821
01:06:34,125 --> 01:06:36,298
I didn't think there was anything wrong.

822
01:06:36,417 --> 01:06:38,966
- What did they talk about?
- Oh, I didn't listen, sir.

823
01:06:39,083 --> 01:06:40,835
I didn't think it would be right.

824
01:06:40,958 --> 01:06:42,505
They just talked? Nothing else?

825
01:06:42,625 --> 01:06:44,298
- No, nothing, sir.
- Are you sure?

826
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:46,886
Well, of course I'm sure, sir.
They just talked.

827
01:06:47,583 --> 01:06:49,881
Oh, the Squire asked
for a glass of water.

828
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,719
For the prisoner.
He said he was thirsty so I got him one.

829
01:06:52,833 --> 01:06:54,301
Where is it?

830
01:06:54,417 --> 01:06:55,464
- The water?
- The glass!

831
01:06:55,583 --> 01:06:57,256
I threw it away, sir. It got broken.

832
01:06:57,375 --> 01:07:00,254
- Who broke it? You?
- No, the Squire.

833
01:07:01,833 --> 01:07:03,380
And young Martinus out himself?

834
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:05,968
How did you know that?

835
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:10,593
Never mind.

836
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,425
Sylvia.

837
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:32,547
Sylvia?

838
01:07:32,667 --> 01:07:35,591
- Yes, Father. Whats the matter?
- Oh, there you are.

839
01:07:35,708 --> 01:07:37,210
Oh, nothing, I...

840
01:07:37,333 --> 01:07:39,381
I was just getting
a little worried about you.

841
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:41,969
Why? I'm all right now.
I'm just clearing up.

842
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:46,709
- How's the finger?
- Fine, thank you. Almost healed.

843
01:07:46,833 --> 01:07:48,506
I must get on.

844
01:08:01,292 --> 01:08:05,217
Ah, Peter. I have to go out again.
I want you to do something for me.

845
01:08:05,333 --> 01:08:08,587
Don't let Sylvia out of your sight
until I tell you it is safe to do so.

846
01:08:08,708 --> 01:08:10,301
- But, sir...
- Please.

847
01:08:11,417 --> 01:08:13,761
Believe me when I say she is in danger.

848
01:08:24,625 --> 01:08:26,719
(Insects chirping)

849
01:09:05,458 --> 01:09:08,667
- What can I do for you?
- We have met before, young man,

850
01:09:08,792 --> 01:09:11,591
in somewhat disturbing circumstances.

851
01:09:12,458 --> 01:09:14,881
However, I shall not
hold that against you.

852
01:09:15,958 --> 01:09:18,256
Is Mr Hamilton in?

853
01:09:18,375 --> 01:09:20,002
He's in but he's busy.

854
01:09:20,125 --> 01:09:23,049
Good. Will you tell him
that I want to see him?

855
01:09:23,167 --> 01:09:25,386
I've told you, he is busy.

856
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:28,629
I'm glad to hear it.
I, too, am a busy man.

857
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:32,084
But as I have found the time
to come all the way out to see him

858
01:09:32,208 --> 01:09:35,007
I think that he could come out to see me.

859
01:09:35,125 --> 01:09:36,923
Would you tell him that, please?

860
01:10:17,833 --> 01:10:19,085
Well?

861
01:10:20,958 --> 01:10:22,335
Yes, thank you.

862
01:10:23,625 --> 01:10:26,299
- Are you being funny?
- No, I'm not being funny.

863
01:10:26,417 --> 01:10:28,215
I'm just trying to remember
my manners.

864
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,968
I wish I could say the same for you.

865
01:10:32,292 --> 01:10:35,546
My name is Forbes.
Yours is Hamilton, I believe.

866
01:10:35,667 --> 01:10:37,135
What do you want?

867
01:10:39,417 --> 01:10:41,840
I want to talk to you, Mr Hamilton.

868
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:53,626
In private.

869
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,385
Get out.

870
01:11:00,708 --> 01:11:02,255
What do you want to see me about?

871
01:11:03,250 --> 01:11:04,968
About Alice Tompson.

872
01:11:05,083 --> 01:11:06,756
About young Martin us.

873
01:11:06,875 --> 01:11:09,628
- About my daughter, Mr Hamilton.
- What about them?

874
01:11:10,917 --> 01:11:13,591
And about many others
who should be at rest now,

875
01:11:13,708 --> 01:11:15,176
at rest in their graves.

876
01:11:16,917 --> 01:11:19,170
- What has happened to them?
- How should I know?

877
01:11:20,375 --> 01:11:22,548
I don't know how but you do know.

878
01:11:22,667 --> 01:11:24,669
You know very well
what has happened to them.

879
01:11:24,792 --> 01:11:26,260
Are you mad?

880
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:31,257
I almost wish I was.
This business is so appalling.

881
01:11:31,375 --> 01:11:32,422
Mr Hamilton...

882
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,093
Am I right in thinking

883
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:38,257
that you have spent a large part
of your life in the Caribbean,

884
01:11:38,375 --> 01:11:40,844
in Haiti, to be precise?

885
01:11:40,958 --> 01:11:43,177
And while you where there,

886
01:11:43,292 --> 01:11:45,841
did you learn something
of the practice of voodoo?

887
01:11:46,958 --> 01:11:48,426
You are mad!

888
01:11:48,542 --> 01:11:51,967
No, I'm not.
But can the same be said of you?

889
01:11:53,792 --> 01:11:55,760
Get out of here!

890
01:11:55,875 --> 01:11:57,752
- I'm not going.
- Yes, you are.

891
01:12:13,292 --> 01:12:15,135
Good night, Mr Hamilton.

892
01:12:25,208 --> 01:12:27,506
Well, I'm ready.

893
01:12:43,833 --> 01:12:45,927
(Insects chirping)

894
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:17,502
(Footsteps)

895
01:14:33,625 --> 01:14:35,218
(Drum beats)

896
01:16:26,875 --> 01:16:29,594
Kada nostra. Kada estra.

897
01:16:31,833 --> 01:16:33,835
Kada nostra.

898
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:36,343
Kada estra.

899
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:40,879
- Kada nostra.
- What was that?

900
01:16:44,833 --> 01:16:46,005
Nothing, Peter.

901
01:16:52,292 --> 01:16:53,839
Come to me.

902
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,502
You will come to me.

903
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:06,969
- What is it?
- Some water, please.

904
01:17:07,083 --> 01:17:08,585
Come and sit down.

905
01:17:36,417 --> 01:17:37,589
Sylvia?

906
01:18:11,333 --> 01:18:12,835
(Clock chimes)

907
01:19:43,083 --> 01:19:44,175
(Door opens)

908
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:46,797
(Door closes)

909
01:19:49,292 --> 01:19:51,420
(Footsteps)

910
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:13,218
(Grunting and groaning)

911
01:20:24,125 --> 01:20:25,342
Aargh!

912
01:20:33,125 --> 01:20:34,297
(Groans)

913
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:55,797
(Grunts)

914
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:05,547
Help! Help!

915
01:22:52,667 --> 01:22:54,135
(Drum beats)

916
01:24:52,583 --> 01:24:55,132
- Hamilton, where is he?
- I don't Know.

917
01:24:55,250 --> 01:24:57,503
- Where is he? Where is he?
- I don't know.

918
01:24:57,625 --> 01:24:59,969
- Do you want to burn to death?
- No, no, no!

919
01:25:00,083 --> 01:25:02,051
- Where is he?
- He's in the mine.

920
01:25:31,708 --> 01:25:33,506
(Drum beats)

921
01:26:42,750 --> 01:26:43,797
(Sylvia screams)

922
01:26:59,667 --> 01:27:01,465
Get to the mineshaft, all of you!

923
01:27:13,083 --> 01:27:14,551
(Gasps)

924
01:27:15,458 --> 01:27:17,677
Peter, look out! Peter!

925
01:27:18,333 --> 01:27:19,710
Ohh!

926
01:27:30,875 --> 01:27:32,297
(Hamilton screams)

927
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,627
(Sylvia) Hurry!

928
01:27:45,625 --> 01:27:46,922
(Hamilton) Ah! Let me out!

929
01:27:48,708 --> 01:27:50,005
(Screams)
