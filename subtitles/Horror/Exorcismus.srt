1
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,740
I can do it.

2
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,740
Go away.

3
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,980
Hey.

4
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,700
No, you...
leave me alone.

5
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,980
Come on, come on, come on.

6
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,100
Get off!

7
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,380
I'm going to do it.
I'm going to it.

8
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,380
Gonna do, do, do it.

9
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,580
You're just cheating now.

10
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,620
No, I'm not.
I can win this.

11
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,500
Not you.
You're a loser.

12
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,500
Ugh.

13
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,420
Goal!

14
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,620
Goal!

15
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,620
Yes!

16
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,700
How about it?

17
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,060
Shall we play another game?

18
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,460
I'm sick of you
and your childish games.

19
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,780
You're just scared of losing.

20
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,060
Come on.

21
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,180
No.

22
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,700
I'll just play by myself.

23
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,300

Yeah.

35
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,460
Well, look, I'm just getting
through the door.

36
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,220
So, yeah, if you just give me
five minutes,

37
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,780
I can email it to you.

Okay.

39
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,380
Yeah, okay. Bye.

40
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,340
Hi, love.

41
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,540
Hey.

42
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,860
Finish the article?

43
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,860
More or less.
And you?

44
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,420
So-so.

45
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,340
We still need more tests
for the new drug.

46
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,340
More tests?

47
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,700
Poor little guinea pigs.

48
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,460
Done your homework, you two?

49
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,140
- Yes.
- Mm.

50
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,940
How's the hand?
Does it still hurt?

51
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,700
Are we still sulking?

52
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,340
What's the problem?

53
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,540
It's because of that concert
she wants to go to in London.

54
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,180
Emma, I've already
told you once.

55
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,020
That evening, I have to stay
late at the lab,

56
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,780
and your father has a meeting
at the magazine.

57
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,420
We need you
to take care of Mark.

58
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,060
Again?

59
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,380
Yes, again.

60
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,580
I can take care myself.

61
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,180
That's enough of that,
thank you.

62
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,260
Besides, you're still too young
to be going to concerts.

63
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,420
Alex and Rose are going,

64
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,820
and they're nearly
the same age as me.

65
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,940
Two years older is not
"nearly the same age."

66
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,060
You know, instead of thinking
about going out so much,

67
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,700
you should try
studying a bit more.

68
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,300
I don't care
what your cousins are up to.

69
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,300
I know what's best
for you, okay?

70
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,820
But, Dad...

71
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,380
You know what,
you never let me do what I want!

72
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,740
Yes! Got it!

73
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,460
Please stop playing
with that game?

74
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,060
Emma, stop shouting.

75
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,500
You know, if you want something
just say.

76
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,300
Stop bawling
like a five-year-old.

77
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,780
<i>I thought their heads
had dropped</i>

78
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,260
<i>and they'd conceded,
but they've come back strongly.</i>

79
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,860
<i>Penalized for that challenge.</i>

80
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,220
Emma!

81
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,180
Emma.

82
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,500
Lucy!

83
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,300
I don't know what's happening.

84
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,220
Call an ambulance.

85
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,220
Come on, quick!

86
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,100
Um, yeah.
I need an ambulance.

87
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,940
My daughter, she's having
a fit or something.

88
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,700
Yeah.

89
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,300
Emma Evans.

90
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,380
Mum.

91
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,580
Have you and Dad
had a chat yet about

92
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,980
what we said
about secondary school?

93
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,500
Yes.

94
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,020
And?

95
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,940
We both think
it's still too soon.

96
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,260
Probably next year.

97
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,420
But for the moment,

98
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,140
the important thing is
that you get better.

99
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,700
Okay?

100
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,500
Hey.

101
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,620
How's my favorite sister?

102
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,620
Mm.

103
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,500
So... any news?

104
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,180
No. John's talking
to the doctor now.

105
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,980
Oh, here's Dad now.

106
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,860
Hi, Chris.

107
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,180
Well, it's good news.

108
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,820
All the tests
have turned out negative.

109
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,380
Hmm?

110
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,620
And?

111
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,300
I find this incredible,
but they don't seem

112
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,700
to have the slightest idea
what caused the attack.

113
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,260
So what are we
supposed to do?

114
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,940
Nothing.

115
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,780
Just wait and hope
it doesn't happen again.

116
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,220
And how are you feeling, Em?

117
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,060
Emma.

118
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,260
I'm fine.

119
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,740
Don't worry.

120
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,500
God won't let anything bad
happen to you.

121
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,700
I'm going to get
another drink.

122
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,060
Chris.

123
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,620
I know Emma's been
to see you

124
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,260
several times this year,
hasn't she?

125
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,140
Yeah, she helps me out
in the canteen.

126
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,420
Why?

127
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,420
Has she ever said that she was
depressed about anything?

128
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,700
She's a teenager.

129
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,060
She just wants to go to school
like everyone else.

130
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,860
But... you know that.

131
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,420
Lucy, maybe we're making
a big mistake.

132
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,100
What do you mean?

133
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,540
It's only natural
that Emma wants

134
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,900
to be with kids her own age.

135
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,820
Oh, John, we've talked
about this over and over again.

136
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,420
You know the statistics
as well as I do.

137
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,580
Kids who study at home start
college much better.

138
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,580
Emma isn't a statistic, Lucy.

139
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,180
She's our daughter.

140
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,220
And she is just... she's just
not happy at the moment.

141
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,660
When she's older,

142
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,780
she'll thank us for everything
we're doing for her.

143
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,380
You'll see.

144
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,020
<i>Drive safely, darling.</i>

145
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,060
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

146
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,820
<i>Yes, Mum.
Don't worry.</i>

147
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,700
Hi.

148
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,660
Hey.

149
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,140
How'd you get on
at the doctor's?

150
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,660
Fine.
It was nothing in the end.

151
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,020
- Great. That's good news.
- Hi, Emma.

152
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,020
Hi, Auntie.

153
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,620
You missed one
hell of a gig, Emma.

154
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,420
So shit they wouldn't
let you come.

155
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,140
Your parents just need
to chill out.

156
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,020
Are you okay?

157
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,620
Sorry.

158
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,500
My mum's crazy.

159
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,860
She treats me as if I'm
the same age

160
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,620
as my spoilt brother.

161
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,620
Well, you two, I'm off.

162
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,500
When I finish my exams,
we'll have another party.

163
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,500
Take care, yeah?

164
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,500
All right.

165
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,460
You be nice to Mum.

166
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,820
Yeah. See you in a bit.

167
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,540
Emma, what are you doing
out here?

168
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,500
They're waiting for you inside.
Come on.

169
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,940
Okay, yeah. Okay.

170
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,740
Okay.

171
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,820
Can I have your French homework,
please?

172
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,420
<i>Oui, professeur.</i>

173
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,260
<i>Oui professeur.</i>

174
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,580
Fine, Mark.

175
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,580
Emma.

176
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,700
Why isn't it finished?

177
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,340
Emma, you can't keep using
the excuse of your hand...

178
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:26,340
I have to go
to the bathroom.

179
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,900
Sis?

180
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,220
Haven't you been taught
to knock?

181
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,740
The door was open.

182
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,660
It's my fault, then,
I suppose.

183
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,660
Well, what is it now?

184
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,900
You were writing
on the mirror,

185
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,340
and your eyes were...

186
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,980
It freaked me out.

187
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,140
Oh, get lost, you creep.

188
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,100
Happy birthday, cous.

189
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,020
I have a little prezzie for ya.

190
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,380
Enjoy.

191
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,260
Emma?

192
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,260
Yeah?

193
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,460
I need to talk to you.

194
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,140
Can you come down to my study
for a minute?

195
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,540
Yeah, I'm coming.

196
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,300
Emma.

197
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,900
What's wrong?

198
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,100
What?

199
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,100
If I tell you, you have to
promise you won't tell Alex.

200
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,180
Yeah.

201
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,300
My parents are taking me
to see a psychologist.

202
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,220
Is that all?

203
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,980
Emma, loads of kids at my school
see psychologists.

204
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,020
It's fine.

205
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,460
But the thing is,

206
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,820
the guy that they're sending me
to see is, like, a freak.

207
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,860
Why?

208
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,380
He hypnotizes people.

209
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,620
What if I tell him about
all the dodgy stuff I get up to,

210
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,380
and I don't even
realize it, like?

211
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,220
Look, we can easily find
a solution for that,

212
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,580
if you want.

213
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,260
All right, well,
I'm just going to dim

214
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,740
the lights a little bit.

215
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,940
There.

216
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,020
That's much better.

217
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,140
Good.

218
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:45,020
Now we can start.

219
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:49,540
Now, if there's anything that
you don't want to talk about,

220
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,780
you're under no obligation
to do so.

221
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,180
What I want is that
you feel relaxed.

222
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,380
All right.

223
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,940
Your parents tell me
that they teach you at home

224
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:06,340
but that you would
really rather go

225
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,420
to the secondary school
with teenagers your own age.

226
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,500
Is that right?

227
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,340
Yeah, that's right.

228
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,940
Are you comfortable?

229
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,620
<i>Yeah.</i>

230
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,260
<i>Your hand...
does it hurt?</i>

231
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,620
<i>Not anymore.</i>

232
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,140
Exactly what happened?

233
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,020
I slipped in the bathroom

234
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,500
and knocked over
the mirror and cut my...

235
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,540
cut myself with it.

236
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,620
Emma?

237
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,580
Emma, are you okay?

238
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,780
Yeah.

239
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,420
Sorry.

240
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,540
Good.

241
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,180
Now, what I want you to do

242
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,300
is to concentrate
on my finger.

243
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,780
Okay?

244
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,820
Concentrate.

245
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,780
Look at my finger.

246
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,260
Look at it.

247
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,060
That's it.

248
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,300
Start relaxing.

249
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,220
<i>Your heartbeat slows down.</i>

250
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,220
<i>And it's slowing down.</i>

251
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,660
<i>That's good.</i>

252
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,860
Your arms are heavy.

253
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,260
Your eyelids are heavy.

254
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,740
Your heart is slowing.

255
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,620
Good.

256
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,060
Your arms are heavy.

257
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,460
You need to sleep.

258
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:41,260
Good.

259
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:55,420
Would you say
that you are happy, Emma?

260
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,180
<i> Have you ever
taken drugs, Emma?</i>

261
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,580
<i>Have you had sex yet, Emma?</i>

262
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,980
<i>Do you do everything
your told, Emma?</i>

263
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,420
Emma?

264
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,660
Emma?

265
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,420
<i>- Emma, wake up.
- Emma's not going to wake up.</i>

266
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,980
How are you doing?

267
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:52,700
What happened today,
it wasn't your fault.

268
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,780
You know that, don't you?

269
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,500
If you want to talk about it...

270
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,940
or anything...

271
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,820
But, Emma, your voice.

272
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,060
The guy had a heart attack
because of what you said.

273
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,820
You went straight
for the jugular with him.

274
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,820
I was under hypnosis.

275
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,180
I... I don't remember anything.

276
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,500
Anything?

277
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,220
Oh, Emma.

278
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:53,780
<i> Good.</i>

279
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,580
<i>Would you say
that you are happy, Emma?</i>

280
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,140
<i> Have you ever
taken drugs, Emma?</i>

281
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:04,220
I have no idea what I did.

282
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,620
And what, you think I can kill
someone just by talking to them,

283
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,020
even with that voice?

284
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,940
What, so it's just
a coincidence, then?

285
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,060
Is that right?

286
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,300
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, that's right.

287
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,540
Oh!

288
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,540
What are you doing?

289
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,420
- Oh.
- What are you doing?

290
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,500
I think I pressed
the wrong button.

291
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,900
Emma, you've deleted it!

292
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,220
What have you done that for?

293
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,420
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.

294
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,460
For God's sake.

295
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,060
Emma, what are you doing?

296
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,700
I said I'm sorry, Rose.

297
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,580
I've got class.

298
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,820
I'll talk to you later.

299
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,980
Do you want to try?

300
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,780
No. I'm okay, here.

301
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,860
Dad, what's wrong with Emma?

302
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,060
Nothing.
She's fine now.

303
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,140
She's acting weird.

304
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,580
You wait till
you're a teenager.

305
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,900
You'll be just as bad.

306
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,380
No. I won't be like that.

307
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,260
Well, we'll see, won't we?

308
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,260
Emma.

309
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,860
What happened, sweetheart?

310
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,580
It's fine.

311
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,020
Emma, Emma.
Everything's fine.

312
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,180
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

313
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,060
Everything's fine.
Okay?

314
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,700
It's fine.

315
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,980
Everything's okay.

316
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,340
Everything's fine.

317
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,660
Hi, Emma.
It's Christopher.

318
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,660
Listen. Your dad called.

319
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,660
Seems he and your mum
are really worried.

320
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,100
Are you okay?

321
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,260
Look, there's nothing wrong
with me, all right?

322
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,700
Okay.

323
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,660
But if you do want to talk
about it, anything at all,

324
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,020
just call me, okay?

325
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,900
Anytime.

326
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,740
Yeah, okay.

327
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,060
Bye, Uncle.

328
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,980
Bye.

329
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,940
<i>Creator of Heaven and Earth
and Jesus Christ.</i>

330
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,420
<i>Father Taylor.
Stop this now!</i>

331
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,420
<i>This has gone far enough.</i>

332
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,420
<i>Do not allow...</i>

333
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:04,380
<i>No vuelva a acercarse a ella.</i>

334
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:08,460
<i>The decision has been taken.</i>

335
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,020
Emma, your breakfast is ready.

336
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,140
Mum,

337
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:38,380
it's just that the other day,
when I saw Uncle, I...

338
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,100
I remembered
what had happened.

339
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,020
Hasn't he ever spoken to you
about it?

340
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,380
No, not much.

341
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,700
I've only heard him say that

342
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,540
he misses being able
to say Mass.

343
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,180
Yeah, he went through
a really bad time.

344
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,140
Do you think that girl
was really possessed?

345
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,060
The Devil doesn't exist, Emma.

346
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,580
The girl was very ill.

347
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,180
That's all.

348
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:06,500
So it was all his fault, then,
that she died?

349
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,780
No, I didn't say that.

350
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:16,980
In his way,

351
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,220
Christopher did everything
he could to help her.

352
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,020
Mark, are you going
to be long?

353
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,420
I need to come in.

354
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,540
I'm in the bath,
and I haven't finished yet.

355
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,060
Just let me in for a second
to get something.

356
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,420
Wait until I say so.

357
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,020
Okay.

358
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,740
Let's see how ticklish
you still are.

359
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,340
No, no, no, no.

360
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,060
What's wrong?

361
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,380
No.

362
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,900
Don't do that to me!
You know I don't like it!

363
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:58,980
I'm sorry.

364
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,260
No! Go away!

365
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,740
Hi, darling.

366
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,900
Are you okay?

367
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,860
Hey.

368
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,500
What's wrong?

369
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,300
Oh, darling,
what's the matter?

370
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,900
Emma?

371
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,300
Emma, are you there?

372
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,860
<i>The number you have reached
is currently unavailable.</i>

373
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,100
<i>Please try later.</i>

374
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,980
Miriam, what can I get
for you?

375
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,180
A bit of everything?

376
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,460
How are you, Rufus?

377
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,860
Hey. I believe you.

378
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:51,180
Or at least I believe
you believe it all to be true.

379
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,940
Look, Emma.

380
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:02,140
Carrying out an exorcism
is a very serious business.

381
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:07,340
To start with, I'd need
the permission of my diocese.

382
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:13,540
And even if I asked them,
they'd probably refuse.

383
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,220
The communion of our saints.

384
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,220
Forgiven us of sins.

385
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,580
The resurrection of the body

386
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,900
and life everlasting.

387
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,260
Is that because of what
happened to that girl?

388
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,860
You just don't want
to help me.

389
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,580
No, no.

390
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,500
I do. It's just...

391
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,180
All right.

392
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,260
You have to trust me.

393
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,140
Okay?

394
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,540
Here.

395
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,580
Take it.

396
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,460
Ugh.

397
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,260
All right.

398
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,260
It's all right.

399
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,300
It's all over now.

400
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,900
It's all over.

401
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,540
Are you okay?

402
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,220
Now do you believe me?

403
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,980
Yes.

404
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,340
Do your mum and dad
know you're here?

405
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:03,180
No.

406
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,900
Look.

407
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:08,500
Because of your age, I can't
help you without their consent.

408
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:11,300
But if you tell my mum,
she won't let me do anything!

409
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,060
You know that.

410
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,660
Yeah.

411
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,860
I'm not lying.

412
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,820
It was the night
of my birthday party.

413
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,860
We played on the Ouija board.

414
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,300
We wanted to invoke the Devil.

415
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,780
What did you want
to do that for?

416
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,380
I don't know.

417
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,340
But the important thing is,

418
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,340
something evil entered me
that night.

419
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,100
I'm just...

420
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,460
I'm just frightened
it's gonna force me to...

421
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,540
To what?

422
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,460
To harm myself.

423
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,500
Or Mark or you both.

424
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,540
No, I'm sorry,
but I don't believe it.

425
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,420
I can't accept it.

426
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,380
- But, Mum...
- Your mother's right, Emma.

427
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,940
It doesn't make sense.

428
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,700
We are looking for another
psychologist to treat you.

429
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,100
That's what you need,
not a priest.

430
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:03,100
Oh, and there's something else
we've been thinking too.

431
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,700
We would prefer you
to carry on studying at home,

432
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,940
but, if you like,
then next year,

433
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,460
you can go to the same
high school as Rose.

434
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,980
So aren't you pleased?

435
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,460
Yeah.

436
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:25,100
I'm just tired.

437
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,820
Oh, Spirit, if you are there,
give us a sign!

438
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,180
Fuck.

439
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,980
Are you moving it?

440
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,740
You prick.

441
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,380
Ooh, I am the Devil.

442
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,980
That was funny.

443
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,180
We have to take Emma
to the hospital again.

444
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,060
What we should do
is call Christopher.

445
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,420
No way.

446
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,940
He's the one who put all this
into her head

447
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,420
in the first place.

448
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,380
I shouldn't have let Emma go
and see him so often.

449
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,820
What we believe is irrelevant.

450
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:42,340
What's important is
that Emma believes it.

451
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,900
Just listen to me
for a second, will you?

452
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,500
You've said it yourself:

453
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,540
placebos work because
the patients believe in them.

454
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,620
Well, getting Christopher in
to do an exorcism

455
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,820
just might be the placebo
that Emma needs.

456
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,260
What the hell
are you talking about?

457
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,900
You know full well
it's not the same thing.

458
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,180
Look, we have to do something.

459
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,820
I'm too tired for this.

460
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,820
Good night.

461
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,420
Shit.

462
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,220
Listen. I think
your parents are right.

463
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,300
Emma, evil spirits
only exist in films.

464
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,260
You're just scared.
That's your problem.

465
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,260
No, I'm not.

466
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,380
For God's sake.

467
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,620
What then?

468
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,700
You think I'm mad too, do you?

469
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,900
No.

470
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,260
I think that your uncle
the priest

471
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:28,140
has been putting these
crazy ideas into your head.

472
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,780
Emma, Catholics really get off
on all that Satan crap.

473
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,580
It's your dad's fault
for marrying one.

474
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,780
Ugh. My mum doesn't even
believe in God.

475
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,020
Mm.

476
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:39,020
Well, all of her family
are Catholic,

477
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,100
so she's got it in her blood.

478
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,340
So have you.

479
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,340
Oh, look.
It's going to be fine.

480
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,060
Emma, you're gonna be fine.

481
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,620
Look, don't be silly.

482
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,820
It's fine.

483
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,660
Okay?

484
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,140
Don't be silly.

485
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,100
I knew you were a dyke.

486
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,580
- No, I'm not.
- Oh, yes, you are!

487
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,860
You're just
a dirty little bitch,

488
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,300
a dirty little dyke!

489
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,380
You're a cow!

490
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,260
Rose, what happened?

491
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,020
Rose, what happened?

492
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,860
No! Fuck off!

493
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,940
Please, Rose, please.

494
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,220
I didn't mean to. Please.

495
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,740
No, don't fucking touch me!

496
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,540
Ow.

497
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,780
Oh, my God, Emma.

498
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,580
I'm so sorry, Emma.

499
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:26,700
Emma, you're bleeding.

500
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,820
Emma, I'm so sorry.

501
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,820
Get away!
Rose, go!

502
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,300
Rose, go! Go!

503
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:34,980
Emma, I'm so sorry!

504
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,940
Hi, Alex!

505
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,300
<i>Hey, I've been talking
to Rose,</i>

506
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,860
<i>and she told me
that you had a row.</i>

507
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,980
<i>What about?</i>

508
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,140
Didn't she tell you why?

509
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,660
<i>No, not at all.</i>

510
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,140
<i>She won't say
a damned thing about it!</i>

511
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,620
<i>Come on.
What's it all about?</i>

512
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,940
Uh, it's nothing.

513
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,540
It's a stupid thing.

514
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,980
It's not important.

515
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,780
<i>Look, I finish my exams
in a couple of days.</i>

516
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,380
<i>Let's meet up
and talk about it, yeah?</i>

517
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:07,220
Yeah.

518
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:22,820
Can you get a move on
with those carrots?

519
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,260
Mmm.

520
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:30,060
This is going to be yummy.

521
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:39,500
How long has it been
since we last cooked together?

522
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,580
Hmm?

523
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,700
You loved to help me out
when you were a kid.

524
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,420
Making cookies
was your favorite thing.

525
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,420
You used to eat half of them
before they'd cool down.

526
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,140
I thought you were
playing football.

527
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,380
No. Dad told me
to come in here,

528
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,580
or I'd catch a cold.

529
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:00,380
Oh. Well, go on,
get the dishes, then.

530
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,820
Well, if you'd rather do
the cooking,

531
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,820
I'll make the table.

532
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,340
Bowls or plates?

533
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,100
Plates.

534
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,420
Mum! Mum!

535
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,420
God! Emma!

536
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,620
Oh, my God!

537
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,620
Oh, my God.

538
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,780
Oh, God.

539
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,020
What's the matter?

540
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,860
Stop it, Emma.
Stop it.

541
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,340
Stop it.

542
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,540
What's going on in...

543
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,980
I don't know.
I don't know.

544
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,180
Hold her by the ankles.

545
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,940
Watch she doesn't kick out!

546
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,900
Sweetheart.

547
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,980
It's all right.
it's all right.

548
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,140
You're okay.

549
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,300
You're all right.

550
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,940
Everything's fine.

551
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:34,340
Everything's gonna be okay.

552
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,980
All right?

553
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,140
<i>Chris, it's John.</i>

554
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,580
<i>I'm calling because...</i>

555
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,700
<i>could you come over
to the house when you can?</i>

556
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,540
<i>It's about Emma.</i>

557
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,660
<i>You.</i>

558
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,660
<i>You have to help us, Chris.</i>

559
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,700
I have a couple
of ground rules.

560
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:13,540
Firstly, I'll need to stay here
until Emma is well again.

561
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,820
If something happens,

562
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,180
I don't want to be
two hour's drive away.

563
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,820
Mark's room's free.

564
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,740
You can sleep there.

565
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:26,860
We've sent Mark
to your Auntie Sarah's.

566
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,900
And we're going to give
the classes a rest for a while.

567
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,780
All right?

568
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:37,420
Second rule:
no questions.

569
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,220
I'll only tell you
what I think you need to know.

570
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:43,260
And of course you can't take
part in the exorcism sessions.

571
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,700
The Devil is a very good liar.

572
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,660
My faith may help me
to distinguish

573
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,660
between the truth and lies,
but without faith,

574
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:54,140
it's too dangerous.

575
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,260
And no one must know I'm here,

576
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,020
not even your sister Sarah.

577
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,740
Emma, have you talked to Alex

578
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:07,380
or to Rosie about
what's happening to you?

579
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,900
No.

580
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,900
Good.

581
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,740
Let's keep it like that.

582
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,860
You can go to bed now
if you like.

583
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,340
We'll start first thing
in the morning.

584
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,060
Best if you're not tired.

585
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,700
Good night.

586
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:31,100
Oh, there is one more thing.

587
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,020
I'd like to record
everything that happens

588
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,620
in the exorcism sessions.

589
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:37,540
If the diocese gets wind
of what I'm doing,

590
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,140
I want them to know
that I had a good reason

591
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,820
for disobeying them.

592
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:45,140
I think that's a good thing.

593
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,660
All right.

594
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,220
That's it, then.

595
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,180
We start tomorrow.

596
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:57,260
Are you sure this
is what you want, Lucy?

597
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,740
Don't worry.

598
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,860
God never abandons
anyone to evil.

599
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,540
Everything's ready.

600
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,580
There's nothing
to be scared of.

601
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:16,300
You probably won't remember
any of it afterwards.

602
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:37,420
Please, sit down.

603
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,060
Don't worry.

604
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,460
This is just so that
you can't harm yourself.

605
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,220
Put your foot down.

606
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,500
Holy water.

607
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:58,260
The circle is to prevent
the Demon

608
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,340
from using you to harm
anyone outside it.

609
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,020
Of course, if I'd been able
to get the support

610
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:05,140
of the archdiocese,

611
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:07,180
we'd be doing this
on holy ground,

612
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,900
which is where the Devil
is at his weakest.

613
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:14,460
But don't worry.

614
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,100
This circle should hold him.

615
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:33,260
Uncle.

616
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:36,740
<i>In nomine
lesus, exorcizo te.</i>

617
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:40,300
<i>In nomine lesus,
dice nomen tuum.</i>

618
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:43,100
<i>In nomine lesu, si es hic,
manifesta te.</i>

619
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:45,540
<i>In nomine lesus,
exorcizo te.</i>

620
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:48,060
<i>In nomine lesus,
dice nomen tuum.</i>

621
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:51,220
<i>In nomine lesu, si es hic,
manifesta te.</i>

622
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:53,220
<i>In nomine lesus,
exorcizo te.</i>

623
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,140
<i>In nomine lesus,
dice nomen tuum.</i>

624
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:58,300
<i>In nomine lesu, si es hic,
manifesta te.</i>

625
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,100
<i>In nomine lesus,
exorcizo te.</i>

626
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,660
<i>In nomine lesus,
dice nomen tuum.</i>

627
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:06,340
<i>In nomine lesu, si es hic,
manifesta te.</i>

628
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:10,740
<i>In nomine lesus,
exorcizo te.</i>

629
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:12,940
<i>In nomine lesus,
dice nomen tuum.</i>

630
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:16,220
<i>In nomine lesu, si es hic,
manifesta te.</i>

631
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,580
Away from me,
ye wicked.

632
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:25,460
I will keep the commandments
of my God.

633
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:27,980
Hold thou me up,
and I shall be safe.

634
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,940
Yea, my delight shall be ever
in thy statutes,

635
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:33,500
for they imagine but deceit.

636
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,700
In the name of the Father,

637
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:40,220
in the name of the Son,
in the name of the Holy Spirit.

638
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,220
Amen.

639
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:16,940
How do you feel?

640
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,460
I can't remember anything.

641
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,700
But I'm just really tired,

642
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:23,580
and my whole body hurts.

643
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:24,660
Don't know.

644
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:25,700
What happened?

645
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:29,780
That's between
the two of us...

646
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:30,900
and God.

647
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:34,540
Bu...
this is all absurd.

648
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:37,100
I mean, there must be
a non-theological reasoning.

649
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,340
I've heard priests say
that the Devil is only

650
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:41,220
a metaphor for evil
and not something real.

651
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:43,220
Unfortunately, the Devil
doesn't need bishops

652
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:45,340
to believe in him
in order to exist.

653
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,100
And in Jesus Christ...

654
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:53,020
Father Taylor,
Stop this now!

655
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:54,700
Ana.

656
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:55,900
<i>Dime algo.</i>

657
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:57,140
We are taking Ana away.

658
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:58,540
This has gone far enough.

659
00:45:58,580 --> 00:45:59,740
Please.

660
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:03,700
The decision has been taken.

661
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:06,380
<i>Sofia, es demasiado pronto.</i>

662
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:07,860
<i>Por favor, no se la lleve.</i>

663
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,140
<i>Piense en su hija.</i>

664
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:12,580
<i>No vuelva a acercarse a ella.</i>

665
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:15,300
<i>Padre, no deje que me lleven.</i>

666
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,180
<i>Padre.</i>

667
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,820
Oh, Lord, please help
this innocent girl.

668
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,220
Do not allow a victory for them.

669
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:45,100
Do you think
I'm going to die too,

670
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:48,500
like... that girl?

671
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,820
Ana wouldn't have died
if they had allowed me

672
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,540
to finish what I started.

673
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:57,300
Okay?

674
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,780
Uncle,

675
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,380
There's one thing
that I haven't told you,

676
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:06,980
and I think
it's probably important.

677
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:11,180
But you have to promise
that you won't tell my parents.

678
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:12,940
Of course.

679
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,180
Get to your room!

680
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:59,940
<i>In nomine lesus,
dice nomen tuum.</i>

681
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:04,220
<i>In nomine lesu, si es hic,
manifesta te.</i>

682
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:26,740
How long do you think
you'll be?

683
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:29,580
Great.

684
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:32,900
Yeah, all right.

685
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:34,540
Yeah, I'm fine.

686
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:38,100
Look, uh, I'll see you
in a few minutes.

687
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:40,580
Okay. Bye.

688
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:03,780
<i>Dad! Dad!</i>

689
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:05,100
<i>Dad!</i>

690
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,700
<i>No one is listening to you!</i>

691
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:09,220
John, no.

692
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:10,260
It really hurts, Dad.

693
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,340
Can you ask him to untie me?

694
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:12,740
This is madness.

695
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:14,340
Listen to me.

696
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:15,460
You heard her.

697
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,060
For pity's sake,
you're hurting her!

698
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:18,980
You don't understand.
That's not Emma talking!

699
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:19,980
Get off me!

700
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:26,100
Thank you, Daddy.

701
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:28,100
You're so helpful sometimes.

702
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:29,580
Do you love me, Daddy?

703
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:30,820
Dad?

704
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:31,940
Do you love me?

705
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,140
Tell me you love me.

706
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:35,020
- I love you.
- Release him.

707
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:36,580
I command you:
release him immediately!

708
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:37,860
Oh, You bastard!

709
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,660
Release him immediately.

710
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:40,660
Fucking priest!

711
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:30,060
You understand now
why I told you to stay out?

712
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:32,300
That thing inside Emma

713
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:35,100
is a supremely skilled
manipulator.

714
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:36,460
You must never trust him.

715
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,140
Ever.

716
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:40,300
I can show you the videos
I've recorded.

717
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:41,740
No.

718
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:44,460
It's no longer necessary.

719
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:50,060
Look, it's best that Emma
never knows what happened today.

720
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:53,300
Okay?

721
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:54,380
Yeah.

722
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:55,660
And if you
still don't trust me,

723
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:57,260
I can put you in touch
with another priest.

724
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,460
No.

725
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:02,060
I'm sorry I didn't
believe you earlier.

726
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:07,220
Please help her, Christopher.

727
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:09,100
Help her.

728
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:31,340
Alex.

729
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,980
<i>Hey. You here already?</i>

730
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:43,180
Hi, John.

731
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:44,300
Have you seen Emma?

732
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:45,780
No.

733
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:46,820
Isn't she in her room?

734
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,940
No. I've looked everywhere.

735
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,380
She's not here.

736
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:55,020
Well, do you have any idea
of where she might have gone?

737
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:57,220
And you're sure you can't
remember what you said to Rose?

738
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:00,500
No. When I go like... that,
I never remember anything.

739
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:01,820
What I don't understand

740
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,620
is how your parents
can believe all that crap.

741
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:05,060
It isn't crap.

742
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:06,380
Oh, whatever, Emma.

743
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:07,980
But things can't carry on
like this.

744
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:11,220
The first thing to do is
for you to come home with me.

745
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:12,740
I'm sure my mum
will think of something.

746
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:14,860
No, Alex; my uncle told me not
to talk about it to anyone,

747
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,220
and he found out.

748
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:17,580
Your uncle
is a religious fanatic.

749
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:19,100
After what happened
to that girl,

750
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:21,060
fuck, your parents should never
have let him step foot

751
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:22,060
inside your house.

752
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,420
Oh, you don't understand.

753
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:25,820
If you tell your mum,
they'll put me in an asylum.

754
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:27,740
I'm not mad, Alex.

755
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:29,500
For God's sake, Emma,
you're only 15!

756
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:30,620
You don't realize it,

757
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:31,980
but your uncle's
brainwashed you.

758
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:33,900
That's what's happened.

759
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:35,500
That's what Rose says too.

760
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:39,140
And just because I'm 15
doesn't mean I'm an idiot.

761
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:40,180
I didn't say that.

762
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:41,380
And anyway,

763
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:43,580
you didn't seem to care
that I was only 15

764
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:46,660
when you got with me.

765
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:49,060
What?

766
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,860
The night of my birthday.

767
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:52,860
Don't you remember?

768
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:53,860
No, I don't.

769
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,220
I was tripping.

770
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:57,580
I don't remember a damn thing.

771
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,500
Aah!

772
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:19,820
Alex!

773
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:20,820
What the fuck?

774
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:37,740
Alex?

775
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:39,620
Alex.

776
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:42,740
A-a-alex.

777
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:44,620
Alex.

778
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:45,980
Alex.

779
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:46,980
Alex!

780
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:48,620
Alex! Please!

781
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:49,820
Alex, please wake up!

782
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:52,820
Alex! Alex!

783
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:57,340
Alex.

784
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:59,020
Alex?

785
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:01,140
Alex.

786
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:35,420
I caused the accident.

787
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:37,660
And the cockroaches
weren't even there.

788
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:41,060
You weren't to know that.

789
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:44,380
Either way,
it wasn't an accident.

790
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:49,300
The Devil feeds off pain.

791
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:52,060
That's how he gets his strength.

792
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:56,260
And he especially enjoys hurting
the people you love the most.

793
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:01,260
He used you.

794
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:03,300
Look.

795
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:07,900
You can't tell anyone else
what's happening with you, okay?

796
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,580
And you must make sure
you're never alone

797
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:12,180
with anyone who's important
to you.

798
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:16,380
How is Alex?

799
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:17,740
Better.

800
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:20,900
No spinal injuries, but it will
take him several weeks

801
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:22,460
before he can walk again.

802
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,980
Have you had a chance
to speak to him?

803
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:26,980
He's under sedation
at the moment.

804
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,460
And what about you?

805
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:33,500
You all right?

806
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:35,340
Do you want to see Alex?

807
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:41,340
- Let's go home, Mum.
- Yeah.

808
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:44,740
Darling, I've got to stay with
Mark tonight at Auntie Sarah's,

809
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:47,260
but I'll come and see you
tomorrow morning.

810
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:48,820
Okay?

811
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,900
I'm not hungry.

812
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:09,020
You have to eat.

813
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:10,980
We need you to be strong.

814
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:22,740
Don't worry, Father.

815
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:24,740
I'm not going
to starve to death.

816
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:26,620
I'm not like that other girl.

817
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:28,860
<i>Padre, no deje que me lleven.</i>

818
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:29,860
<i>Padre.</i>

819
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,780
Silence, Demon.

820
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:33,260
Take it easy, Father.

821
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:35,140
We're together forever.

822
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:40,860
John.

823
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,740
Are you sure Mark's your son?

824
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:45,620
You did everything you could
to make sure

825
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:47,340
Lucy didn't get pregnant again,
and yet...

826
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,820
Do you remember Steve?

827
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:55,340
Lucy's colleague,
who was so good-looking?

828
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:07,940
You all right?

829
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:11,380
What happened?

830
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:14,340
Nothing.
Nothing happened.

831
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,020
I'm gonna go to my room.

832
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:58,340
It's the first time
that... this thing

833
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,820
has shown itself
outside the room, right?

834
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,580
It's getting stronger,
isn't it?

835
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:13,660
I'm going to bring
somebody else in.

836
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:15,740
I've been overconfident.

837
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:18,700
I can't do it alone.

838
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:20,820
Who are you going to call in?

839
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:22,460
Father Ennis.

840
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,540
He's my old mentor.

841
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:26,860
He's in Rome, though,

842
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:30,820
so it'll be a few days
before he can get here.

843
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:32,260
By the way,

844
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:36,740
I've already told Emma,
but it's important

845
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:40,740
that you and Lucie
should know this too.

846
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:43,980
You must make sure that Emma
is never alone with anyone.

847
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:48,620
And another thing.

848
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:51,940
You must forget everything
you heard just now.

849
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:52,940
But what she said...

850
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:55,020
The Devil always lies.

851
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:56,620
Always.

852
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:03,180
You can't allow him to use you
for his purposes.

853
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:17,780
Well, I say good night, then.

854
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:19,500
Good night.

855
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:32,900
- Leave me alone.
- Please, please.

856
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:34,100
Lucy, please.

857
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:36,580
You think it's been easy
to say that?

858
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:38,140
You're accusing me
of having an affair.

859
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:39,460
How am I supposed
to react to that?

860
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:40,740
Look, please, just believe me.

861
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:42,420
It's not easy to say,

862
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:44,580
but it's something that was said
the other day by Emma.

863
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:46,380
Yeah, but she's not very well
at the moment.

864
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:48,900
But if I didn't say something,
then I'd be thinking about this.

865
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:50,820
That he's not your son.

866
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:52,660
How can you even think

867
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:54,220
that such a thing
could be true?

868
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:55,660
I'm not gonna take
any kind of tests.

869
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:25,700
Hi.

870
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:27,420
- Hi.
- How are you?

871
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:28,900
Is Auntie looking after you
all right?

872
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:29,900
Yes.

873
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:31,180
That ball's mine.

874
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:32,380
Can I have it back?

875
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:33,620
And what will I get
in exchange?

876
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:34,620
A kiss?

877
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:46,220
If I'm not getting anything
in return,

878
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:48,140
I think I might keep it.

879
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:49,740
That ball's mine.

880
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:51,180
Dad gave it to me.

881
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:58,340
Get lost!

882
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:00,220
I'm going to tell Auntie.

883
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:01,660
Catch!

884
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:06,060
You're stupid!

885
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:14,020
Mark. Where are you going?

886
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:15,340
Come back.

887
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:17,580
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

888
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:03,020
Hi.

889
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:04,180
Rose.

890
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:07,020
I...

891
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:10,620
Let's go, Mum.

892
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:32,900
It's all my fault.

893
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:34,220
I killed him.

894
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:37,660
Can I tell my mom
the truth?

895
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:39,460
It's too late for the truth.

896
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:42,380
It wasn't your fault.

897
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:43,580
I should just kill myself.

898
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:45,140
That's what I should do.

899
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:47,980
Hey.

900
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:50,100
Apart from anything else,

901
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:53,060
you'd be condemning
your soul to Hell.

902
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:55,100
That's a victory for the Devil.

903
01:04:56,780 --> 01:05:01,060
You can't let Mark's death
have been for nothing.

904
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:02,540
Come.

905
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:20,140
Mum, are you there?

906
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:23,620
I need to tell you
something that...

907
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:26,820
that I should have
told you before.

908
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:29,300
It's all my fault, Mum.

909
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:32,260
All of it.

910
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:44,540
One day, I went to visit Uncle
in the canteen, and...

911
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:46,260
I told him that I had played
on the Ouija board.

912
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:47,580
Why did you want to do that?

913
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:50,340
I don't know.

914
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:51,740
I thought he'd get angry.

915
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:55,660
He just laughed instead
and said that invoking the devil

916
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:57,460
wasn't as easy as it seemed

917
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,260
and that playing
with the Ouija board

918
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:00,940
just... just wasn't enough.

919
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:03,180
I thought that's what you do,
though, with the Ouija board,

920
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:05,100
because it's supposed
to invoked spirits, yeah?

921
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:07,540
Well, spirits
but not the Devil.

922
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:09,020
I mean, in order
to invoke the devil,

923
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:10,900
you need to make
a blood sacrifice.

924
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:14,460
Sacrifice?

925
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:16,060
Their own blood?

926
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:17,740
I'll show you.

927
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:22,180
Uncle Chris knows
a lot about it.

928
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:26,180
He has loads of stuff
about the Devil in his flat.

929
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:35,340
He showed me how the girl
who died did it.

930
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:38,220
Ana invoked the Devil
using this pentagram.

931
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,020
She drew it with her own blood.

932
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:41,420
I pretended not
to be interested,

933
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:44,620
but I memorized it.

934
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:46,500
I memorized it all.

935
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:52,420
The night of my birthday,
I played on it again.

936
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:54,220
Oh, spirit, if you are there,
give us a sign.

937
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:55,500
Uncle was right.

938
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:57,220
It was a waste of time.

939
01:07:57,260 --> 01:07:59,980
But that night,
when I came home,

940
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:01,540
you were waiting up for me.

941
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:02,740
Where the hell have you been?

942
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:06,220
Do you realize what time it is?

943
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:07,500
You realized I was drunk,

944
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:08,940
and you shouted at me.

945
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:10,140
You find it funny?

946
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:12,220
You will not leave your room
for the next month.

947
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:13,660
You will stay in,
you will study,

948
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:16,460
and there will be no allowance,
no friends, nothing.

949
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:20,740
I... hate you so much.

950
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:21,700
Aah.

951
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:23,380
Get to bed!

952
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:25,420
Get to bed now!

953
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:31,020
Mum...

954
01:08:32,260 --> 01:08:34,380
I've never been so angry.

955
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:38,140
I got really, really angry.

956
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:42,620
What happened after that,

957
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:47,220
well, it wasn't an accident.

958
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:49,300
I didn't slip in the bathroom.

959
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:52,380
I did it on purpose.

960
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:55,660
I cut myself because...

961
01:08:55,660 --> 01:08:57,660
because I wanted to.

962
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:22,940
I started to draw
the pentagram.

963
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:25,380
And just... just like
that girl did.

964
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:30,060
And it worked.

965
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:34,220
And I felt that something
took over my body.

966
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:39,020
He... he asked me
what I wanted.

967
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:46,180
I want to be free.

968
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:50,660
I want to be free.

969
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:54,060
I told him I wanted to be free,

970
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:56,780
especially
free from my family.

971
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:01,740
But I didn't know it would be
like this, Mum.

972
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:05,340
I didn't even believe in...
the Devil existed.

973
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:07,180
I'm so sorry.

974
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:12,620
Mum, say something.

975
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:14,740
Mum, please say something.

976
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:20,580
Say anything.
Just please say something.

977
01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:29,060
Please.

978
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:58,060
Mum.

979
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:02,700
What are you doing?

980
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:05,180
Mum, what are you doing?

981
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:07,740
Mum!

982
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:09,300
Mum!
What are you doing?

983
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:10,300
Mum!

984
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:11,980
What are you doing?

985
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:13,220
Mum.

986
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:22,220
Please stop.
What are you doing?

987
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:24,820
Mum, please.

988
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:26,100
What's wrong?

989
01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:27,380
Mum, look at me, please.

990
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:29,340
What's wrong?

991
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:32,860
Mum.

992
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:34,820
Mum!

993
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:37,660
Where are you going?

994
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:39,860
I'm so sorry.

995
01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:43,500
I'm so sorry.

996
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,780
Please forgive me.

997
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:47,660
Please forgive me!

998
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:51,940
Mum. Mum.

999
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:53,340
Mum, no!

1000
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:54,660
Mum, no!

1001
01:11:56,260 --> 01:11:58,980
Mum!

1002
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:11,380
Mum, Mum, you're all right.

1003
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:14,300
You're all right.
You're okay.

1004
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:17,060
Can you hear me sweetheart?

1005
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:18,780
Sarah's coming
to the hospital with you.

1006
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:21,060
I'll come as soon as I can,
all right?

1007
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:53,740
Father Ennis.

1008
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:55,860
It... it's Christopher.

1009
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:58,460
Did you get my message?

1010
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:01,660
Please. You must come.

1011
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:05,100
It's very...

1012
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:08,260
I beg your pardon.
Monsignor.

1013
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:10,300
I forgot.

1014
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:18,500
Good morning.

1015
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:19,980
I'm going back to the hospital,

1016
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:22,580
take some things to Mum.

1017
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:25,020
How is she?

1018
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:26,220
She's resting.

1019
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:28,660
Can I come with you?

1020
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:31,140
No. It's better you don't.

1021
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:32,940
Christopher will be down soon.

1022
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:35,300
If anything happens, he'll...
he'll take you to the hospital.

1023
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:39,260
I'll see you later.

1024
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:44,420
Hi, Chris.

1025
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:46,900
I'm going to the hospital
to take some things for Lucy.

1026
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:48,460
How are you doing?

1027
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,460
Well, tired,
but I'll be all right.

1028
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:53,100
- Give her my love.
- Okay, will do.

1029
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:56,100
I'll see you later.

1030
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:58,180
Hi.

1031
01:13:58,220 --> 01:13:59,300
How are you doing?

1032
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:15,540
Emma, your mum's gonna be fine,
you know?

1033
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:17,020
God won't...

1034
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:18,980
Let anything bad happen
to her, I know.

1035
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:22,780
You told me the same
in the hospital.

1036
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:26,860
I'm not going to carry on
doing the exorcisms.

1037
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:28,460
Emma.

1038
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:30,660
If it hasn't worked so far,

1039
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:33,060
what makes you think
that it'll work now, like?

1040
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:34,540
I can't do any more.

1041
01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:35,700
Emma, please.

1042
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:37,220
Uh-uh.

1043
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:39,780
I'm going to ask my dad
to put me in

1044
01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:42,340
a psychiatric hospital
or something.

1045
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:44,260
You're not mad, sweetheart.

1046
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:45,460
No?

1047
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:48,780
I see insects
that aren't really there.

1048
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:51,900
I hear voices in my head,

1049
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:54,100
and I kind of caused everything
that has happened.

1050
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:56,220
If you'd seen
what I've seen...

1051
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:58,500
Well maybe that's it,
because I haven't seen anything.

1052
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:02,820
I want to see the tapes.

1053
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:03,900
All of them.

1054
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:06,060
No, I can't.

1055
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:07,820
It'd be too painful for you.

1056
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:11,300
In that case, forget it.

1057
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:14,460
Listen to me, please.

1058
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:15,820
I've asked another priest
for help.

1059
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:17,180
He'll be here
in a couple of days,

1060
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:19,620
and between the two of us,
we will be able to help you.

1061
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:20,980
I don't care.

1062
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:24,500
Emma, think
of your mum and dad.

1063
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:25,740
You can't give up.

1064
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:27,860
Are you going
to show me those tapes?

1065
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:29,700
No.

1066
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:07,100
Sorry about earlier.

1067
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:11,620
I didn't mean to be rude
or offensive.

1068
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:14,260
Don't worry about it.

1069
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:16,220
I'm going to my room.

1070
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:30,620
<i>Everlasting God.</i>

1071
01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:32,620
<i>I don't understand you,
priest!</i>

1072
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:33,820
<i>Silence!</i>

1073
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:34,820
<i>Be quiet, or I swear...</i>

1074
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:36,980
<i>You'll do what?</i>

1075
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:40,900
<i>You're not doing anything
to let me leave this body.</i>

1076
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:45,180
<i>What do you want exactly,
little priestling?</i>

1077
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:48,300
<i>What is your little game?</i>

1078
01:17:56,140 --> 01:17:58,900
<i>Don't tell me you don't
find me attractive.</i>

1079
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:01,900
<i>Hold your tongue!</i>

1080
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:03,420
<i>Uncle.</i>

1081
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:04,660
<i>Why did you do that?</i>

1082
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:07,140
<i>Oh, Emma,
are you okay. sweetheart?</i>

1083
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:08,260
<i>You're okay.</i>

1084
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:15,620
<i>In the name of the Son,
in the name of...</i>

1085
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:17,900
<i>Dad! Dad! Dad!</i>

1086
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:20,100
<i>No one is listening to you!</i>

1087
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:21,060
<i>John.</i>

1088
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:23,620
<i>Daddy?</i>

1089
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:24,620
<i>Do you love me daddy?</i>

1090
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:25,900
<i>I love you.</i>

1091
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:30,860
<i>You bastard, fucking priest!</i>

1092
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:43,020
<i>Thy Kingdom come,
thy will be done,</i>

1093
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:44,500
<i>on Earth as it is in Heaven.</i>

1094
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:52,020
<i>Thanks to you, I've gotten
stronger and stronger.</i>

1095
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:54,940
<i>Not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil,</i>

1096
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:57,860
<i>for thine is the kingdom,
the power, and the glory.</i>

1097
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:03,620
<i>Amen.</i>

1098
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:22,820
<i>At last.</i>

1099
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:24,420
<i>I've caught you.</i>

1100
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:35,540
Don't worry.

1101
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:37,580
God won't let anything bad
happen to you.

1102
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:40,100
Ana wouldn't have died
if they'd allowed me

1103
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:41,700
to finish what I started.

1104
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:49,540
You can't let Mark's death
have been for nothing.

1105
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:50,620
I memorized it.

1106
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:52,100
I memorized it all.

1107
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:53,940
I mean, in order
to invoke the Devil,

1108
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:55,900
you need to make
a blood sacrifice.

1109
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:23,580
Hey.

1110
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:31,340
Look, I know this has been
really hard on you,

1111
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:34,940
but we can't allow him
to prevail.

1112
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:36,900
We must keep on fighting.

1113
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:39,220
You've never fought him.

1114
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:41,260
You have never tried to get
the Demon to go away.

1115
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:44,060
Don't be silly.

1116
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:45,540
I've seen the tapes.

1117
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:49,900
No. Look.

1118
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:52,140
Look, you can't
possibly understand

1119
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:53,660
what's happening on those tapes.

1120
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:55,180
I'm not stupid!

1121
01:20:56,540 --> 01:20:58,220
Okay?

1122
01:20:58,220 --> 01:20:59,900
You knew if I did
what you explained

1123
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:02,300
that the invocation would work.

1124
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:04,420
You told me all about it
even so.

1125
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:07,500
No, no, that's not true.

1126
01:21:07,540 --> 01:21:10,860
You made that decision
by yourself, Emma.

1127
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:12,860
This whole thing
is a lousy trap!

1128
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:14,900
You're mad,
and that's all.

1129
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:16,540
You're stark raving mad.

1130
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:17,540
No. Emma...

1131
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:19,940
Emma.

1132
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:22,140
Leave me alone.

1133
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:23,500
I didn't trap you.

1134
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:26,500
Don't you touch me.

1135
01:21:26,540 --> 01:21:28,460
You have to understand.

1136
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:34,300
All I wanted was that
what happened to Ana...

1137
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:37,380
what's happening to you now...
never happens to anyone else.

1138
01:21:37,420 --> 01:21:40,220
You've completely destroyed me
and my family.

1139
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:41,340
That's what you've done!

1140
01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:45,140
That's what you... Fuck!

1141
01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:50,300
No one has ever proved
the existence of the Devil.

1142
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:53,100
You and I have done this
together.

1143
01:21:53,140 --> 01:21:54,500
No.

1144
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:56,500
And I've got him on tape.

1145
01:21:56,540 --> 01:22:00,980
Now the truth will be known...

1146
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:04,060
by everyone.

1147
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:06,100
But why did you take
such a long time?

1148
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:07,980
And... and why did you have
to put me through th...

1149
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:13,020
I needed the Devil to grow
stronger so that I could...

1150
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:16,380
I... I'm so sorry, Emma.

1151
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:19,140
I had no choice.

1152
01:22:19,180 --> 01:22:22,100
He's too strong in you now

1153
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:25,020
for me to conquer
single-handed.

1154
01:22:25,060 --> 01:22:27,420
But when Ennis arrives,
it will all end.

1155
01:22:27,460 --> 01:22:28,420
I promise you.

1156
01:22:29,420 --> 01:22:30,820
I promise you.

1157
01:22:30,860 --> 01:22:33,660
Now...

1158
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:35,380
give me the tapes.

1159
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:42,860
Mark d...
Mark died because of you.

1160
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:45,220
Because of you.

1161
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:47,300
Mark... Mark died be...

1162
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:48,860
Marked died because of...
because of you!

1163
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:50,460
My brother died because of you.

1164
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:53,940
I will always regret
that I was unable to save him.

1165
01:22:53,980 --> 01:22:57,020
But I promise you, he will be
remembered as a martyr.

1166
01:22:57,060 --> 01:22:59,340
I'm going to tell everyone.

1167
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:01,260
No. No, Emma.
No, Emma.

1168
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:03,300
You sick freak!

1169
01:23:03,340 --> 01:23:04,900
I fucking hate you!

1170
01:23:04,940 --> 01:23:06,940
Don't you understand?
This is bigger than all of us.

1171
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:08,420
- Emma, stop it, please.
- Bitch!

1172
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:09,980
Now listen.
Give me, give me...

1173
01:23:10,020 --> 01:23:10,980
No!

1174
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:13,260
Emma, Emma, I'm sorry.

1175
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:14,940
Emma, no! Stop!
I'm sorry.

1176
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:16,540
I said stop!

1177
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:20,820
I'm sorry, Emma,

1178
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:23,780
but you know I can't allow you
to destroy the truth.

1179
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:32,220
Where are they?

1180
01:23:32,260 --> 01:23:33,500
Give them to me.

1181
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:37,700
You're pathetic, priest.

1182
01:23:52,860 --> 01:23:55,380
Do you know something?

1183
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:58,220
Your plan was ridiculous.

1184
01:23:58,260 --> 01:23:59,500
What do you think?

1185
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:01,140
That Ennis and his friends
in Rome

1186
01:24:01,180 --> 01:24:03,340
don't know the truth already?

1187
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:05,580
Your tapes
won't help you at all.

1188
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:07,900
I could have destroyed them
if I had wanted to.

1189
01:24:07,940 --> 01:24:10,660
Why do you think I didn't do so?

1190
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:13,300
You're naive, priest.

1191
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:16,820
You've destroyed the lives
of your family for nothing.

1192
01:24:16,860 --> 01:24:18,300
You're lying.

1193
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:29,340
No!

1194
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:32,380
Behold the cross of the Lord.

1195
01:24:32,420 --> 01:24:37,180
I exorcize thee,
most vile spirit,

1196
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:39,620
the very incarnation
of our enemy.

1197
01:24:39,660 --> 01:24:42,700
Emerge and flee
from this creature of God.

1198
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:45,300
He Himself commands you,

1199
01:24:45,340 --> 01:24:48,860
He who commands the seas,
and the winds, and the storms.

1200
01:24:51,180 --> 01:24:55,460
Hear me and be afraid,
oh, Satan, enemy of the faith.

1201
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:58,060
Abandon the body
of this innocent child.

1202
01:24:58,100 --> 01:24:59,100
I command thee.

1203
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:01,980
In the name of Christ, depart.

1204
01:25:02,020 --> 01:25:04,220
Depart!

1205
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:05,220
Depart!

1206
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:17,540
God, the Father,
commands thee.

1207
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:18,900
God, the Holy Ghost,
commands thee.

1208
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:20,620
God, the Son, commands thee.

1209
01:25:20,620 --> 01:25:22,460
God, the Holy Ghost,
commands thee.

1210
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:26,260
Don't be silly, priest.

1211
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:30,540
Christ, God's word made flesh,
commands thee.

1212
01:25:30,540 --> 01:25:32,180
Shh. Calm down.

1213
01:25:32,220 --> 01:25:34,020
Calm down.

1214
01:25:35,220 --> 01:25:37,340
Almost finished.

1215
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:41,060
You've done a very good job,
little priest.

1216
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:44,580
Very good job indeed.

1217
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:46,580
What's that mean?

1218
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:48,100
Without you,

1219
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:50,540
I could have never managed it.

1220
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:52,700
So much pain.

1221
01:25:52,740 --> 01:25:57,260
The Evanses turned out
to be a wonderful feast.

1222
01:25:57,260 --> 01:26:00,500
No!

1223
01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:04,020
God, who so loved the world
that He gave up his only son

1224
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:06,900
for those who believe in Him...

1225
01:26:06,940 --> 01:26:08,900
Christopher.
What the hell are you doing?

1226
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:09,900
Commands thee!

1227
01:26:09,940 --> 01:26:11,660
Abandon the body
of this earthen child.

1228
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:13,940
No! It's not your daughter.

1229
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:15,020
Bastard priest!

1230
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:16,940
I'll kill you!

1231
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:20,500
If you go near my daughter
again, I'll kill you, you hear?

1232
01:26:20,540 --> 01:26:22,660
Kill you!

1233
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:26,940
Almost finished.

1234
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:53,700
Dad.

1235
01:26:53,740 --> 01:26:55,620
Dad. Dad!

1236
01:26:55,660 --> 01:26:57,340
No, dad!

1237
01:26:57,380 --> 01:26:59,620
Dad, please!

1238
01:27:00,940 --> 01:27:05,380
Dad.

1239
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:53,780
There he is.

1240
01:27:53,820 --> 01:27:56,740
And everything
that has happened is his fault.

1241
01:27:56,780 --> 01:27:58,140
Everything.

1242
01:27:58,180 --> 01:28:05,380
If it weren't for him,
Mark would have never died.

1243
01:28:05,420 --> 01:28:09,500
Mum would've never lost
her mind.

1244
01:28:09,540 --> 01:28:13,580
I know. I know.

1245
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:17,860
So what are you going to do
about it, sister?

1246
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:20,460
What are you going
to do about it?

1247
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:04,860
I can't.

1248
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:10,500
You're a coward, Emma.

1249
01:29:10,540 --> 01:29:12,900
You let him destroy your family,

1250
01:29:12,940 --> 01:29:16,740
and you're not going to do
anything about it.

1251
01:29:16,780 --> 01:29:18,540
You disgust me.

1252
01:29:25,420 --> 01:29:27,660
This is your last chance.

1253
01:29:27,660 --> 01:29:32,700
Kill him and avenge them all.

1254
01:29:32,740 --> 01:29:38,420
It's true, sister.

1255
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:39,540
Kill him.

1256
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:40,700
You have to kill him, Emma!

1257
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:11,380
Please... kill me.

1258
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:13,660
Kill me.

1259
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:15,980
Kill him now!

1260
01:30:15,980 --> 01:30:19,180
Shut up, once and for all.

1261
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:34,020
No.

1262
01:31:35,580 --> 01:31:37,620
I wanted to die.

1263
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:40,100
I want to be dead.

1264
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:41,500
I want to be dead.

1265
01:31:41,540 --> 01:31:43,620
Emma.

1266
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:44,980
My name is Ennis.

1267
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:49,740
I'm an old acquaintance
of your uncle's.

1268
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:52,140
It's over, Emma.

1269
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:54,060
The Devil has gone.

1270
01:31:55,820 --> 01:31:58,180
How do you know?

1271
01:31:58,220 --> 01:32:01,740
Open your hand.

1272
01:32:09,620 --> 01:32:13,020
Why did he go?

1273
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:14,540
I don't know.

1274
01:32:15,660 --> 01:32:17,860
Perhaps he thought
you were dead.

1275
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:19,100
Or, more probably,

1276
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:21,340
he had simply achieved
what he wanted

1277
01:32:21,380 --> 01:32:23,580
when he entered your body.

1278
01:32:23,620 --> 01:32:24,900
It is impossible to know.

1279
01:32:24,940 --> 01:32:27,940
Where is my uncle?

1280
01:32:27,980 --> 01:32:30,900
I'm sorry, Emma.

1281
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:33,180
I'm afraid Christopher
didn't wait for God

1282
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:35,900
to pass judgment
on his mistakes.

1283
01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:38,700
What Father Taylor did
is unforgivable.

1284
01:32:38,740 --> 01:32:42,900
But you may be sure that God
will make him pay for it.

1285
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:46,140
And the tapes?

1286
01:32:46,180 --> 01:32:47,180
They are in a safe place.

1287
01:32:47,220 --> 01:32:48,260
Don't worry about that.

1288
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:50,540
No one will ever see them.

1289
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:56,380
What I want is my family back.

1290
01:32:56,420 --> 01:33:00,740
Can your God
give that to me...

1291
01:33:02,340 --> 01:33:04,860
Father?

1292
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:06,660
Can he?
