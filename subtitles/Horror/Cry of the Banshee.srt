1
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,770
H is for heretic.

2
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,306
Margaret Donald,

3
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:23,857
you were a kitchen maid in
the house of the widow Rockby,

4
00:02:23,858 --> 00:02:27,072
who was burned as a
witch this seven days.

5
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:30,902
Heathen charms were
found in your room.

6
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,028
No.

7
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:35,747
Who gave them to you?

8
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,450
I know nothing.

9
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:42,828
Damn it girl, the
more I find to punish,

10
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,081
the more I find to discover.

11
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:48,131
Who else came to the house
consorting with the witch?

12
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,302
I know nothing of witchcraft.

13
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:55,892
Very well.

14
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,064
No. No.

15
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,230
No.

16
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:14,198
Do you still maintain
that you know nothing?

17
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,959
Nothing, nothing.

18
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,416
According to the law,

19
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,251
as a witch,

20
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,836
you are to be whipped
through the street

21
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,680
until your back is bloody,

22
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,925
and then to look on the
world from the stocks.

23
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:41,220
That, and that mark,

24
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,474
may help you to remember.

25
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,567
Court dismissed.

26
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,195
Go on, beat her.
Go on, whip her.

27
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:57,844
Come on, come over here.

28
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,138
Go on, throw it at
her, you filthy witch.

29
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:05,263
Go on. Hey.

30
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:08,517
Throw it at her, the
filthy witch, go on!

31
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,523
Mad dog my Lord,

32
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,322
cut my sheep to pieces!

33
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,870
I've never seen
anything like it,

34
00:06:01,871 --> 00:06:03,830
as if the hound's bewitched.

35
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,035
Creature straight
from Hell, was it?

36
00:06:08,036 --> 00:06:10,503
Aye my Lord, they
say it comes by night,

37
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:13,914
from the far fields
where the dead men walk.

38
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,916
Devils be damned.

39
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,668
There's 20 Oxford
crowns to the man

40
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,712
who brings me its head,

41
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,303
and proves to you that
there is no witchery.

42
00:06:22,304 --> 00:06:23,424
You heard Lord Edward,

43
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,894
let's go hunt the mad dog down!

44
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,381
Father!

45
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,517
What do we have here, hmm?

46
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,144
Only two heathens?

47
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,522
The others escaped us,

48
00:07:18,523 --> 00:07:20,522
they're learning new tricks.

49
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,945
You promised us entertainment.

50
00:07:21,946 --> 00:07:23,694
And you shall have it!

51
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,780
What is that in your hand, boy?

52
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:28,953
Hmm? Pipes?

53
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,325
What's the matter?

54
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,044
Didn't that witch
of a mother of yours

55
00:07:33,045 --> 00:07:35,537
give you spells and charms

56
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,958
to coax music from
those heathen pipes?

57
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,002
May!

58
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,723
What about this young girl? Huh?

59
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,264
Do her feet have magic? Hmm?

60
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,812
Dance! Play!

61
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:56,935
My husband,

62
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,605
please, I beg of you,

63
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,324
<i>Why wife?</i>

64
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:07,367
Here we have the son and
daughter of some sorceress,

65
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,749
and I'm damned if they shan't
afford us some merriment.

66
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:14,998
Dance, play!

67
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,625
Dance, bitch!

68
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,609
It's a hound with its
paw caught in a trap.

69
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:45,617
Or a banshee telling
us that death is near.

70
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:50,872
Come, let us banish thoughts
of death with this, hmm?

71
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,035
Witch!

72
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,077
Come on Burke, rip it off!

73
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,393
Come on!
Take it off girl!

74
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,487
Let my sister be!

75
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:09,817
Let my sister be!

76
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,571
Let her be!

77
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:15,781
Please!

78
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,953
Please sir! Please help me!

79
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,540
Kill you! I'll kill you!

80
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,783
Murderer.

81
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,741
Murderer.

82
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,753
Take care of your tongue, woman.

83
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,331
He can soon get a third wife.

84
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:48,879
Yes, he's right.

85
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,961
Sean, take your
mother up to her roam.

86
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,555
Quiet her.

87
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,739
It is a banshee.

88
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,322
Banshee?

89
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:20,999
No.

90
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:25,370
No, it is only a mad dog that
has been killing our sheep,

91
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:30,838
and frightening the
villagers, nothing more.

92
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,107
Were you born this way?

93
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,664
Or did he raise you evil?

94
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,835
My real mother raised
me, God rest her soul.

95
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,750
And she was a wife to him.

96
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:13,172
Without him, you'd be nothing.

97
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:16,796
Nothing?

98
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,187
Doesn't matter.

99
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,430
No.

100
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,776
Don't you know? You don't?

101
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,775
Don't you know?

102
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,445
- This house is cursed!
- You be quiet!

103
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,569
And you, you are cursed,

104
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,572
and Edward's cursed,
and everybody's cursed!

105
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,951
Your house is cursed.
You he quiet.

106
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,453
You are cursed!

107
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:01,006
You need someone
young for your bed,

108
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,259
not my father.

109
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,188
No.

110
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,711
Come on, come on, come on.

111
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,745
Oh, take your time, boy.

112
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,667
Say something nice to
the kind gentleman,

113
00:15:15,668 --> 00:15:17,463
no need to be afraid of him.

114
00:15:17,464 --> 00:15:19,376
He's as gentle as a lamb.

115
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,586
Ahh, we'll he more gentle to him

116
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,555
than those who
strung him up there.

117
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:24,765
Woop.

118
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:31,807
Now, for our bit of kindness,

119
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,568
you can show us a
bit of gratitude.

120
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:36,685
Yes.

121
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,739
Who'd have use for a dead
man's hand, Mr. Mickey sir?

122
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,616
Witches, my boy.

123
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,949
There's evil around.

124
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,923
And there goes more of
those damn Whitmans.

125
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,838
Mark my word boy,

126
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,890
there's gonna be more
evil around this place.

127
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,435
I take it you'd prefer
still to he in Cambridge?

128
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:16,859
Father, I'd never
come home out of choice.

129
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:51,845
Welcome home, Harry.

130
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,265
Father's upstairs.

131
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,599
Welcome home, Lord Harry.

132
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,944
Oh, it's good to have
you back again, sir.

133
00:16:59,945 --> 00:17:01,811
My, you are looking well.

134
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,199
This the new Priest
for the parish?

135
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,276
Aye, Father Tom,
my brother Sean.

136
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,695
Your predecessor lived to be 50.

137
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,780
56.

138
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:15,122
He called me a
liar for six years.

139
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,874
Let's try some of
Father's whiskey.

140
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,330
Well you're back just in time

141
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,457
for some fine hunting, Harry.

142
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,177
That is if your tastes have
changed over the years.

143
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:29,965
The ways of witchery
still continue.

144
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,675
- Still?
- Aye.

145
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,804
I'd have thought by now
you'd have destroyed them all.

146
00:17:33,805 --> 00:17:36,972
New ones spring up all the time.

147
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,641
Hah, I think they
do it to plague me.

148
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,434
Or perhaps to please you.

149
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,153
Knowing what you do
when you find them.

150
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,320
Father, you may
have heard that they

151
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:51,366
think of me as some kind of
a monster in the village.

152
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,870
Well, I'm a hard
magistrate, it's true.

153
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,744
But, authority is the
main point of government,

154
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,997
and maintaining authority is

155
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,082
the main purpose of the law.

156
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,503
Did they teach you that in your

157
00:18:05,504 --> 00:18:07,503
fine Cambridge college, Harry?

158
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,006
I heard it's easier
to presume guilt

159
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,259
than to assume innocence.

160
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,760
And I think so too.

161
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,887
Well I'll expect
you both to join me

162
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,724
in stamping out the
heathen practices

163
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,851
that continue to occur here.

164
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:23,852
Witchcraft?

165
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:26,896
It's just toys to
these simple people,

166
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:30,276
but it's still a crime
against God and the crown.

167
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,406
That's no way to treat a man

168
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:37,784
when he's trying to sleep.

169
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,878
I can treat my groom

170
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:42,955
any way I like.

171
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:45,999
You.

172
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:55,592
There's too much of your
father in you, my dear.

173
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:12,902
Ow!

174
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,532
Hey.

175
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,660
Oh, he's beautiful.

176
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:22,911
Hello.

177
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,371
Hello.

178
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:25,538
Hey, hey.

179
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,382
Where did you come from?

180
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,711
We can have him for supper.

181
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,381
Oh, no.

182
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,929
It's one of my friends.

183
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,057
You've got better things
to do, haven't you?

184
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,972
Go on, there you go, go on!

185
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,516
Hey, hey.

186
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:52,821
Oh no.

187
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,825
We must go back, I'll be missed.

188
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,907
- Come on.
- Right.

189
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:13,387
My lady.

190
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,235
Woah, woah.

191
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,273
No.

192
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,274
No.

193
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:21,865
Come back with us, my Lady.

194
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,993
Oh, it's only a hound.

195
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:29,204
Death.

196
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,582
Will visit our house.

197
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,835
Ah, winter's coming in.

198
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,129
And the wolves are
coming with it.

199
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,130
No.

200
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,216
Come on, let's go back.

201
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,217
No. No.

202
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:01,486
Harry!

203
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,164
Sister, dear.

204
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,702
It's as though we're
all seeds of evil.

205
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,704
Thank you Roderick.

206
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,083
Another of your sons?

207
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,837
No, no, he's my stud groom.

208
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:03,967
He seems to have a calming
effect on the Ladyship,

209
00:23:03,968 --> 00:23:06,810
and so I have allowed
her to keep him.

210
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,512
She found him,

211
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,732
wandering in the woods
one time many years ago.

212
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,651
When he was a little boy.

213
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,902
Get off the streets!
The mad dog's coming!

214
00:23:20,903 --> 00:23:23,619
Clear the streets, you
hear me? Clear 'em!

215
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,950
Go home.

216
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,248
Go home child.

217
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,334
Don't move.

218
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,427
Sir, sir! Stay back!

219
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,845
It's the mad dog!

220
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,013
UP there!

221
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,857
Stand still!
Don't move, child!

222
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,444
Stay back.

223
00:24:01,445 --> 00:24:02,908
Wait, you have no weapon.

224
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:04,901
Now, now.

225
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:08,947
Stay, stay. There there,
good boy, good boy.

226
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,246
Stay. Stay, stay.

227
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,503
Stay.

228
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:23,921
It's all right, he's
gone. He's gone.

229
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,343
Thank ye sir, for
saving the girl.

230
00:24:27,344 --> 00:24:28,809
You saved her life, sir.

231
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:34,265
Does that give you
power over animals?

232
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:36,766
Why, no.

233
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:38,144
I've had it since
<i>I</i> can remember.

234
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:39,941
It must be centuries old.

235
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,948
What does this lettering mean?

236
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:44,821
I don't know.

237
00:24:44,822 --> 00:24:46,285
But surely your parents,

238
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,329
well they must've tied it there.

239
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:51,030
Well, I have no parents.

240
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,500
Thank ye for saving
us from the dog, sir.

241
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,964
The only power I recognize is

242
00:25:04,965 --> 00:25:06,885
that of our Lord,
Mistress Maureen.

243
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,136
So that dog
couldn't be bewitched.

244
00:25:10,137 --> 00:25:11,886
It couldn't be
fulfilling this curse.

245
00:25:11,887 --> 00:25:14,804
Only children, or
the simplest villager,

246
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,057
could possibly think so.

247
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:19,898
I hear it didn't look so
heathen once Roderick tamed it.

248
00:25:19,899 --> 00:25:22,520
It slunk away with its
tail between its legs.

249
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,198
But about Roderick.

250
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:29,369
Where does he get his
power over animals?

251
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,409
It strikes you strange?

252
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:35,747
Strikes me fortunate for that
little girl and the witch.

253
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:39,918
That medallion he wears.

254
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,212
If you're curious, you'd
best ask him yourself.

255
00:25:43,213 --> 00:25:46,711
I did. He doesn't know
where it comes from.

256
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,588
Or what it means.

257
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,091
Or so he claims.

258
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,310
You think him a liar?

259
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,398
You suspect him of witchcraft.

260
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,152
Our Roderick is no more
a sorcerer than I am.

261
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,400
We're all safe with him,

262
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:07,942
and care nothing of who he
is or where he comes from.

263
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,827
I understand.

264
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:12,988
Do you?

265
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,869
Then you best treat
it as you would

266
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,584
the most sacred confession.

267

Where is she?

292
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,158
It's an honor, my Lord.

293
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,868
Welcome to my inn, sir.

294
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:44,998
Ah, your new
wench, where is she?

295
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,926
She's only a serving
wench, my Lord, sir.

296
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,219
Well, get some of your
foul drink and bring her.

297
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,474
What can I do for you, my Lord?

298
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:04,724
Well now my girl,

299
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:05,977
you don't want to spend
the whole of your life

300
00:28:05,978 --> 00:28:07,819
as a serving wench, do you?

301
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10,941
I have no wish
to change my trade.

302
00:28:10,942 --> 00:28:11,986
Wishes or not...

303
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:15,985
You will.

304
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:17,078
No, no my Lord!

305
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:42,888
. No!
. Yes!

306
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,676
Burke!

307
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:31,524
Acorns.

308
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:33,943
And shells.

309
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:35,990
And feathers.

310
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:38,864
Heathen witchcraft.

311
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,585
You're too pretty to be a witch.

312
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,127
Landlord.

313
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,426
Everybody out.

314
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:02,133
You heard his Honor, out!

315
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,551
Come on.

316
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:04,927
She's the one.

317
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,521
The one that bewitched my dogs.

318
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:08,849
What's your name?

319
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:12,393
- Maggie.
- Maggie?

320
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:13,987
You're not a witch,
are you Maggie?

321
00:30:13,988 --> 00:30:16,357
No, no m'Lord, I'm not a witch.

322
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,909
You just sell charms
to the old folks.

323
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,487
That's right.

324
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,990
I just sell charms
to the old folks

325
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,783
or whoever may buy them.

326
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,099
So you.

327
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:57,063
Sell.

328
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,316
Charms.

329
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:01,443
Hmm?

330
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,994
Are you a follower
of the old religion?

331
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:09,158
Hmm?

332
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,747
No, <i>I</i> never was.

333
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,009
But you know who is?

334
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,251
Hmm?

335
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,936
I know who's selling them!

336
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,808
Do they have real power?

337
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,482
They think they do.

338
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,740
Power like God's power?

339
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,697
Wrath,

340
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:44,902
like God's wrath?

341
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:48,498
No, it's something you feel.

342
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,664
Who is their leader?

343
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:54,913
Who?

344
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:00,760
<i>Oona.</i>

345
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:02,970
<i>Oona.</i>

346
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,345
<i>Oona.</i>

347
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,921
More treason against God.

348
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,132
My children.

349
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:38,057
My children. My children.

350
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,735
My children!

351
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,520
Look.

352
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:30,611
My children!

353
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:33,362
Wait.

354
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:35,491
Oona, bring her forward.

355
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,996
<i>Oona.</i>

356
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:44,250
I have spared your
life as a reminder

357
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:46,923
that I will not tolerate
your heathen ways

358
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:49,671
as long as I am Magistrate here.

359
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:53,141
Now, you and the rest
of your filthy heard,

360
00:34:53,142 --> 00:34:54,925
scatter into the hills!

361
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,349
I never want to set
eyes on you again.

362
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:00,315
My children.

363
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:03,735
All my children.

364
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:06,650
Why?

365
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:09,153
Why?

366
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,611
You better kill me too,

367
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:15,487
Edward Whitman,

368
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:18,907
than let me live
with this memory.

369
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:22,037
If your sorcery
was so strong, Oona,

370
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:25,962
why didn't you use it
to save your children,

371
00:35:25,963 --> 00:35:27,791
as you call them, huh?

372
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,294
All right!

373
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:52,826
Oona, Oona.

374
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,363
Oona, Oona.

375
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,741
Lord Satan.

376
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:01,992
Oona, Oona.

377
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:05,463
God of miracles and wonders.

378
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,925
On this evil day,

379
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:10,926
I curse

380
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:13,926
Lord Edward Whitman!

381
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:18,184
I curse his flesh,

382
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:20,763
his blood,

383
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,057
his wife,

384
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,642
his children,

385
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:28,185
and his house!

386
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,978
Curse. Curse.

387
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:30,979
God Satan,

388
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,028
I conjure you,

389
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,828
to send me an avenger.

390
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,535
So terrible...

391
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:43,200
That death shall wrench them

392
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,045
once forever from this Earth!

393
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:50,499
I conjure you, Lord Satan.

394
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,836
Send me an avenger!

395
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,511
Avenger! Avenger!

396
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,388
What do you want of me?

397
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,548
And what are you doing,

398
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,051
stealing through the night?

399
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:44,263
Some secret meeting a
brother should know?

400
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,609
Sleep is difficult
in this house now.

401
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:51,685
Harry.

402
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,897
There's a madness over us.

403
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:56,106
And some say...

404
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,529
Some say what?

405
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,736
That we're cursed?

406
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:03,030
And Lady Patricia,

407
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,827
is there no cure in
the Doctor's physic?

408
00:38:04,828 --> 00:38:07,452
Her only cure is to get
away from this place too.

409
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:10,672
I must think on it.

410
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:13,591
Well, don't think too long.

411
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,585
Harry.

412
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,045
I know.

413
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:19,923
I was just looking at them.

414
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:28,144
Wolves or witches, eh?

415
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,272
I don't know anymore.

416
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,485
I think I should find
sleep easier now.

417
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:40,781
Well. Goodnight Sister.

418
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,434
No.

419
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:22,660
No.

420
00:39:22,661 --> 00:39:23,824
- Roderick?
- No!

421
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:25,784
It's only me.

422
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:30,785
Roderick.

423
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,795
Why, you're on fire.

424
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:40,669
Someone calling.
Someone calling.

425
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,254
It was me calling you.

426
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:44,929
I called you, Maureen.

427
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,200
How much longer, Lord Satan?

428
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,829
How much longer must I wait?

429
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:11,533
You sent me the avenger,

430
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:15,004
but not the power to
bend him to my will.

431
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:20,340
Send me that power, Lord Satan.

432
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:25,219
The power to bend
him to my will.

433
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:28,469
That I might destroy...

434
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,553
The house of Whitman!

435
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,600
You must leave.

436
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:37,935
Hmm?

437
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,654
Maureen, you must leave!

438
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:42,073
Not so soon.

439
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:44,408
Go!

440
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,203
Maureen, go!

441
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,128
All right.

442
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:05,462
Witchcraft is a two-fold sin.

443
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,964
The villagers are
beginning to join them!

444
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:08,048
Harry.

445
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,301
And you're destroying yourself!

446
00:41:09,302 --> 00:41:10,926
Harry, I forbid you
to talk like this.

447
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:12,970
And your wife and your family.

448
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,894
My wife was not strong enough

449
00:41:14,895 --> 00:41:17,859
to lead the kind of
life that we lead here.

450
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:21,232
Now it's her own fault
that her mind's grown weak.

451
00:41:21,233 --> 00:41:22,442
And what of Maureen?

452
00:41:22,443 --> 00:41:24,657
How long can she
exist like this?

453
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:28,991
Maureen!

454
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:39,079
Where have you been?

455
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,832
For a walk in the night.

456
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:48,255
Stay in the house was my order!

457
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:49,965
Take your hands off of her!

458
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:50,966
Harry.

459
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,773
Are you afraid for him?

460
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,688
I might try and see if
he's really one of us,

461
00:42:01,689 --> 00:42:02,778
really a Whitman?

462
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,565
As much a son of mine as Sean?

463
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:36,636
♪ Blow away the morning dew.

464
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:40,098
♪ The dew and the dew.

465
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:43,899
♪ Blow away the morning dew.

466
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:47,147
♪ How sweet.

467
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:48,149
Listen.

468
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:50,902
Listen.

469
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,532
It's that mad dog again.

470
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,288
Laughing at your fears.

471
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:01,963
This time we'll get him.

472
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:05,133
And father will
reward you Burke.

473
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,169
Come on.

474
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,879
Come on!

475
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,224
It came from the ruined church!

476
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,521
What are you waiting for?

477
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:29,481
Get my bloody horse!

478
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,407
Burke! Come, help, help me!

479
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:03,742
Help me! Help me!

480
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:29,517
Roderick!

481
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:32,604
Roderick.

482
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:33,697
Here, my Lord.

483
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:08,933
Sean!

484
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,983
It was the dog.
It's bewitched.

485
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:16,191
It's a demon!

486
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:19,781
Sean.

487
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:33,883
Deliver me from all my defences.

488
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:49,561
I cannot tell who
shall gather them.

489
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:52,401
Now Lord, what is my hope?

490
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:55,363
Truly, my hope is even in thee.

491
00:46:56,272 --> 00:46:59,024
It is an evil retribution,

492
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:01,776
but it was pain and grief to me.

493
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:04,029
My heart was hot within me.

494
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,703
And while I was thus musing,

495
00:47:05,704 --> 00:47:08,950
the fire kindled and
at the last I spake.

496
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:12,078
Fair the Lord, let
him be praised.

497
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,039
Lord let me know my mend

498
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,713
and the number of my days.

499
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,089
Father, do you think that...

500
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:22,386
That dog is bewitched as
the villagers believe?

501
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:24,924
<i>Sorcery?</i>

502
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,217
I suppose you know,

503
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:28,892
we're cursed from Hell to
Christmas, we Whitmans.

504
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,521
What if there is a power
that we know nothing of?

505
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:36,023
Now Father's scared
like the rest of us.

506
00:47:36,024 --> 00:47:37,488
Harry, I must talk to you.

507
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:03,923
Roderick?

508
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,639
Wait by the carriage.

509
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:14,974
Roderick.

510
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:18,274
Roderick, it's always Roderick.

511
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:21,570
He's making you weak, Patricia.

512
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:23,734
Be strong.

513
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:26,653
You must take me away.

514
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:28,748
After we've destroyed the
animal that killed Sean.

515
00:48:28,749 --> 00:48:30,907
Oh, don't be such a hypocrite.

516
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,747
You'd have killed
him many times,

517
00:48:32,748 --> 00:48:34,038
if you'd been strong enough.

518
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:36,505
Whether or not I hated
Sean is of no account now,

519
00:48:36,506 --> 00:48:38,249
we must destroy that dog.

520
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:46,925
Sean Whitman...

521
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:50,345
Is dead!

522
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:57,897
A scent, my Lord.

523
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:11,832
Come here, come here!

524
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:08,134
There was no witchcraft,

525
00:50:08,135 --> 00:50:10,465
look, we killed a mad dog.

526
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:14,594
One of the shots in
his brain was mine.

527
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:16,939
Would you please go and
fetch the Lady Patricia?

528
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:19,933
She should be here.

529
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:23,102
We must show these people that

530
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,731
we have no fear, any of us.

531
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:27,899
Burke!

532
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:30,365
Quiet everybody!

533
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:32,570
Silence!

534
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:33,823
Stop the music!

535
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:37,243
Sir Edward's going
to speak to you.

536
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:39,124
Quiet!

537
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:43,164
That mad dog,

538
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:46,920
that you all thought was the
product of sorcery is dead.

539
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:52,892
My beloved son Sean fell
victim to that animal,

540
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:56,928
and not to any kind of sorcery.

541
00:50:56,929 --> 00:50:58,977
The reason you are
all here tonight

542
00:50:58,978 --> 00:51:01,975
is to celebrate its destruction,

543
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:03,774
and to see with
your own eyes that

544
00:51:03,775 --> 00:51:07,188
witchcraft could've had
nothing to do with it.

545
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:11,859
And now, drink, dance, be merry.

546
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:14,988
Music!

547
00:51:58,157 --> 00:51:59,784
M'Lady.

548
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:08,585
Burke.

549
00:52:58,217 --> 00:53:00,265
No! No!

550
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:01,725
No!

551
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,778
I'm no Whitman.

552
00:53:21,824 --> 00:53:23,201
A curse...

553
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:26,661
is on the house of Whitman!

554
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:27,914
She's bewitched!

555
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:31,250
A curse is on the house

556
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:34,919
of Whitman.

557
00:53:44,513 --> 00:53:46,514
She's bewitched,
she's possessed.

558
00:53:46,515 --> 00:53:48,266
Oh my God. God, she's evil.

559
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:55,199
She's bewitched!

560
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:57,405
She's cursed.

561
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:00,579
- This house is evil.
- Leave this house.

562
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:04,574
Don't go!

563
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:06,576
Can't you see my wife is mad,

564
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:08,578
she's not bewitched, don't go!

565
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:09,876
Come hack!

566
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:13,922
Roderick, Roderick.

567
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:17,044
<i>My Lady, my Lady</i>

568
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:18,296
come, come my Lady,

569
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:19,839
<i>come, come.</i>

570
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:23,009
Now my Lady, now, now.

571
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:24,853
Come, come.

572
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:27,189
Come, come.

573
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:30,224
M'Lady, come. Come on.

574
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,729
Come. There.

575
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:38,867
Come my Lady.

576
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:42,904
Quietly.

577
00:54:42,905 --> 00:54:45,784
Gentle, gentle my Lady.

578
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:50,955
Could it be witchcraft?

579
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:54,420
Oona.

580
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:56,876
Oona.

581
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,093
Yes, of course, I
should've known.

582
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:05,891
I showed her mercy once
I should've killed her.

583
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:10,808
If those fools believe
that she still has power,

584
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:14,649
if I should lose my authority...

585
00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:17,939
Burke.

586
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:20,818
I don't care how you do it,

587
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:25,738
bring Oona to me.

588
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:27,332
- Here.
- My Lord.

589
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:37,676
Ugly, isn't it?

590
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:41,214
This is where we
find out the truth.

591
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:43,965
What do you know about Oona?

592
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:45,388
Tell us where she is!

593
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:52,014
We can make you die a minute

594
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,767
every day for a year.

595
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:01,108
Or all in one bloody minute.

596
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:05,787
Save the pain,

597
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:07,990
tell us where Oona is

598
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:11,327
and I promise you,
you'll die in peace.

599
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,759
Why protect her?

600
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:22,838
She's an evil woman.

601
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:27,309
She's corrupt.

602
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,888
You're going to die for her.

603
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:37,476
And for the old religion.

604
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:38,899
Dana's not evil.

605
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,066
The fire's prepared.

606
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,860
No! No!

607
00:56:45,861 --> 00:56:47,363
Come here, girl!

608
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:12,103
Confess and we'll spare you!

609
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:15,932
Oona is good, Oona is peace.

610
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:18,851
Oona heals, Oona is love.

611
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:21,228
No.

612
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:30,706
Where is Oona?

613
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:33,244
What in damnation are you doing?

614
00:57:33,245 --> 00:57:35,368
She's just about
ready to confess, Harry.

615
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:37,963
The Greek walk, it's
your father's orders!

616
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:41,879
Get Lord Edward!

617
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:45,086
So you finally learned
to kill, eh Harry?

618
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:52,046
What's she saying?

619
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:53,299
Cut her down!

620
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,597
Oona. Oona?

621
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:59,595
Get her down!

622
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:02,941
I'm confessing.
I'm confessing!

623
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:07,904
The Lord of wonder.

624
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:11,366
Speak! Speak!

625
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:14,327
Are there powers we cannot see?

626
01:00:14,328 --> 01:00:16,742
He came to my bed and he said

627
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,245
"Child, <i>I</i> will...

628
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:22,245
"I will give you a silver dress,

629
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:25,204
<i>- “if you join Oana and help..."
- Oona, Oona!</i>

630
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:26,205
Where is she?

631
01:00:26,206 --> 01:00:27,628
Can she conjure spells?

632
01:00:27,629 --> 01:00:29,667
Does she work black miracles?

633
01:00:29,668 --> 01:00:34,380
When I'm flying I can
shoot down any Christian

634
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:38,386
who sees me and does
not curse himself.

635
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:41,137
Would she carry out her curse?

636
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:41,855
Oona.

637
01:00:41,856 --> 01:00:43,019
You'll go free!

638
01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:45,567
Tell us, tell us the truth.

639
01:00:45,568 --> 01:00:49,905
I send nightmare cats
to plague the Whitmans

640
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:53,399
with horrible dreams.

641
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,359
Will she fulfill the curse?

642
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,828
You'll go free!

643
01:00:57,237 --> 01:01:00,409
Yes, free, tell us the
truth and you'll go free!

644
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:01,750
- Oona.
- Where is Oona?

645
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,200
Oona.

646
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:05,461
Oona.

647
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,331
Fire.

648
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:12,798
Born in fire.

649
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:16,264
Dies...

650
01:01:17,299 --> 01:01:18,892
Died in fire.

651
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:32,481
Born in fire?

652
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:36,740
She dies with a
riddle on her tongue?

653
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:40,785
And we're no closer
to the witch.

654
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:57,858
Who is it?

655
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:00,744
M'Lady.

656
01:03:03,697 --> 01:03:05,244
Roderick?

657
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:28,851
Roderick.

658
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:52,119
Roderick.

659
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:31,075
God better rise,

660
01:04:31,076 --> 01:04:32,951
scatters presumptuous fools.

661
01:04:35,455 --> 01:04:37,298
Smoke and tempest rages on.

662
01:04:50,512 --> 01:04:53,097
How much are we
paying the weepers?

663
01:04:53,098 --> 01:04:54,896
Five groats a head, my Lord.

664
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:57,727
See that they weep until dawn.

665
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:21,134
God gave you a sad
life, Patricia.

666
01:05:23,128 --> 01:05:25,381
May Heaven give you rest.

667
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:46,447
'Tis witchcraft.

668
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:50,155
It is.

669
01:05:50,822 --> 01:05:52,324
Witchcraft.

670
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,733
Lady Patricia...

671
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:26,399
Is dead!

672
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:44,833
Bully <i>Boy,</i>

673
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:47,002
carry out our plan.

674
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:48,846
Aye, my Lard.

675
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:05,896
We might find a
trace of Oona here.

676
01:07:05,897 --> 01:07:08,273
Is it supposed to be haunted?

677
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:09,483
Look Father!

678
01:07:09,484 --> 01:07:10,656
Who's that?

679
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:20,454
Woah.

680
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:24,124
Stand boy.

681
01:07:25,667 --> 01:07:27,340
Our figure's disappeared.

682
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:37,057
Look Father,

683
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,018
an open tomb.

684
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:52,652
Let's see what's inside.

685
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:54,904
What and who.

686
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:43,869
So, this is our
king of witches, eh?

687
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,704
No, your Honor, no.

688
01:08:45,705 --> 01:08:48,457
Not on the bones
of all the saints.

689
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:49,625
No.

690
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,507
What is so funny, old man?

691
01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:59,891
A Christian Priest
in a heathen place.

692
01:09:00,762 --> 01:09:04,348
Why, these old Gods would
be roaring with anger!

693
01:09:04,349 --> 01:09:06,850
Mickey, what are you doing here?

694
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:08,569
What are you hiding eh?

695
01:09:09,354 --> 01:09:10,354
Eh?

696
01:09:17,445 --> 01:09:19,237
Graverobber.

697
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:20,706
Corpse robber.

698
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:24,456
The dead don't
need their treasures.

699
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,839
If I don't take them,
somebody else will.

700
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,924
Now hear me, all of you.

701
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,961
I must know Dana's whereabouts.

702
01:09:33,795 --> 01:09:36,922
She is a danger and a
menace to all of you.

703
01:09:36,923 --> 01:09:39,392
To protect you, I
must destroy her.

704
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:44,893
To find her, I will kill as
many of you as I need to.

705
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:49,394
Now, who has some information?

706
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:51,984
Which of you knows?

707
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:55,774
Well?

708
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:01,155
Well?

709
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:04,955
Well?

710
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:07,541
There's one!

711
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:13,293
She knows of heathen ways.

712
01:10:13,294 --> 01:10:14,635
I'm sure of it!

713
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:17,047
Seize her!

714
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:22,884
No, please my Lord.

715
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:23,852
Put her on the wheel!

716
01:10:23,853 --> 01:10:25,472
- Please my Lord.
- Hurry!

717
01:10:25,473 --> 01:10:27,681
Nothing, nothing.

718
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:30,231
- Come on, tie her up!
- Please my Lord.

719
01:10:30,232 --> 01:10:32,018
Quickly, man!

720
01:10:32,019 --> 01:10:35,564
I know nothing my
Lord, I'm no witch.

721
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:37,065
Well girl,

722
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:38,150
where is Oona?

723
01:10:38,151 --> 01:10:40,944
I know nothing of Oona, please!

724
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:43,155
Do you know? Where is Oona?

725
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:45,875
- Where is she?
- No my Lord, no.

726
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:50,713
She's not worth
your time, my Lord.

727
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:53,290
No!

728
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,501
No, no!

729
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:57,924
Please, help me!

730
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:08,890
Up there, there's a grave,

731
01:11:09,849 --> 01:11:12,693
which has a picture of
this creature carved on it.

732
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:18,157
Maybe our God is
buried there, eh?

733
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:23,028
Excuse me, your worship,

734
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:25,657
night is coming on and
I must be out of here.

735
01:11:25,658 --> 01:11:26,828
Wait, Mickey.

736
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:30,203
The lettering on that grave,

737
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:32,829
how does it translate?

738
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:34,628
Well that's an
easy one, it says,

739
01:11:34,629 --> 01:11:36,718
"Born by fire, die by fire."

740
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:39,669
What it means, don't ask me.

741
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:41,263
Why, it don't even rhyme.

742
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:49,268
Born by fire, dies by fire.

743
01:12:22,547 --> 01:12:23,639
Maureen.

744
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:26,802
Maureen.

745
01:12:29,387 --> 01:12:32,937
Get out of here,
you gypsy vermin!

746
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:34,858
Get out!

747
01:12:34,859 --> 01:12:36,726
Get out of here!

748
01:12:40,398 --> 01:12:41,866
Get out, get out!

749
01:12:42,567 --> 01:12:43,859
Get out, get out!

750
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:56,171
Come on Roderick,

751
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:58,799
up against the wall!

752
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:01,924
Move.

753
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:05,589
Put your arms up.

754
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:06,716
Up!

755
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:22,983
If we find the witch
maybe Lord Edward...

756
01:13:24,942 --> 01:13:26,535
Will let you go free.

757
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:32,204
Without a flogging.

758
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:37,876
I should pray for
that if I were you.

759
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:53,763
Let's go home, Father.

760
01:14:42,937 --> 01:14:44,109
Maureen

761
01:14:45,064 --> 01:14:46,236
Whitman.

762
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:50,699
Maureen Whitman.

763
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:55,867
Maureen Whitman.

764
01:14:58,119 --> 01:14:59,917
<i>Whitman.</i>

765
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:03,833
<i>Whitman.</i>

766
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:01,060
Roderick?

767
01:16:13,694 --> 01:16:14,991
Roderick?

768
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:27,466
Roderick.

769
01:16:28,626 --> 01:16:30,173
Roderick.

770
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:50,396
God is a spirit, and
they that warship him,

771
01:16:50,397 --> 01:16:53,150
must worship him in the
spirit and in truth.

772
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:57,868
All worship the Lord in
the beauty of holiness.

773
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:01,834
Let the whole Earth
stand in awe of him.

774
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:12,337
Why pray to a powerless god?

775
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:17,715
You cannot help the
girl Maureen any more

776
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:20,845
than you could help
Sean or his mother.

777
01:17:22,429 --> 01:17:25,854
Roderick and I belong
to the old religion.

778
01:17:26,976 --> 01:17:28,434
He belongs to me.

779
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:29,982
Then I'll fight you for him.

780
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:32,105
You cannot fight me.

781
01:17:32,106 --> 01:17:34,274
Then I'll fight for his soul.

782
01:17:34,275 --> 01:17:37,495
His soul? He has no soul.

783
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:40,372
He doesn't exist.

784
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:42,492
He's a sidhe.

785
01:17:43,409 --> 01:17:47,084
Sean Whitman is dead,
killed by my sidhe.

786
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:51,960
Lady Patricia is dead,
killed by my sidhe.

787
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,713
And tonight, another
Whitman will die.

788
01:17:57,423 --> 01:17:59,596
The girl Maureen.

789
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:04,929
Then that one.

790
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:06,603
Harry Whitman.

791
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:10,227
And you.

792
01:18:10,978 --> 01:18:13,731
Until Edward Whitman
is left alone...

793
01:18:14,648 --> 01:18:15,865
And desolate.

794
01:18:16,984 --> 01:18:18,657
And then he too

795
01:18:19,653 --> 01:18:20,779
will die.

796
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:23,823
And Roderick will kill

797
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:26,826
and kill and kill.

798
01:18:26,827 --> 01:18:28,703
Kill.

799
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:31,253
And there is nothing
you can do about it.

800
01:18:54,897 --> 01:18:56,319
Bring her here.

801
01:18:57,316 --> 01:18:59,159
No, let me die.

802
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:02,742
Let me die.

803
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:09,248
My children.

804
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:18,220
My children,

805
01:19:19,088 --> 01:19:21,386
scatter to the hills.

806
01:19:22,466 --> 01:19:25,970
Find back your ways of peace.

807
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:37,694
Somehow Oona had the power

808
01:19:37,695 --> 01:19:39,404
to control Roderick to kill.

809
01:19:39,405 --> 01:19:41,402
Said he's not a
man but a spirit.

810
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:47,957
Lord Edward!

811
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:54,872
Maureen, Maureen.

812
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:56,750
Maureen, was it Roderick?

813
01:19:58,419 --> 01:20:00,717
I thought you said you
had him chained up!

814
01:20:00,718 --> 01:20:02,797
But I, Bully Boy, you!

815
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:04,641
But I did my Lord!

816
01:20:10,973 --> 01:20:12,520
We must find him, Bully Boy.

817
01:20:12,521 --> 01:20:14,063
We will, my Lord.

818
01:20:15,102 --> 01:20:17,150
Here, take this, Father.

819
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:19,906
Lock yourself in.

820
01:20:20,983 --> 01:20:22,734
Don't leave me here Harry.

821
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:24,861
You must lock yourself in.

822
01:20:24,862 --> 01:20:25,862
Not in this place.

823
01:20:25,863 --> 01:20:27,581
It's the only safe place.

824
01:20:28,407 --> 01:20:29,407
Here.

825
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:34,004
Please believe us.

826
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:40,877
Will you give your word?

827
01:20:40,878 --> 01:20:42,801
You will not open
this door to anyone.

828
01:20:43,964 --> 01:20:45,181
Until we return.

829
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:04,785
Keep her safe! We won't
return until we've found him!

830
01:21:04,786 --> 01:21:07,155
And I'll not rest
until he's dead!

831
01:21:53,784 --> 01:21:54,785
Sean?

832
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:57,542
Burke?

833
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:28,194
I want some light.

834
01:22:30,446 --> 01:22:31,698
Lights.

835
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:35,743
Sean? Burke?

836
01:22:37,703 --> 01:22:38,750
I want light.

837
01:22:40,247 --> 01:22:42,043
I want every inch of this house

838
01:22:42,044 --> 01:22:43,838
to shine as bright as noon.

839
01:22:48,172 --> 01:22:50,971
Maureen? Maureen?

840
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:56,347
Maureen, please let me in.

841
01:23:01,018 --> 01:23:02,977
There'll be no more killing.

842
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:04,776
There's no longer
a power over me.

843
01:23:04,777 --> 01:23:07,741
Maureen, we can
go away together.

844
01:23:09,026 --> 01:23:10,448
Please, Maureen.

845
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:13,197
Please let me in.

846
01:23:22,164 --> 01:23:24,792
Please, Maureen.
Please let me in.

847
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:37,054
You know I'll never harm you.

848
01:23:38,889 --> 01:23:39,889
You know that.

849
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:42,520
Father wants to shoot you.

850
01:23:42,521 --> 01:23:45,237
And Harry and Father
Tom are out hunting you.

851
01:23:45,238 --> 01:23:46,687
- Maureen-
- Please!

852
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:48,861
They won't stop and listen,
they'll just kill you.

853
01:25:18,905 --> 01:25:20,248
You killed him.

854
01:25:21,325 --> 01:25:23,043
You killed him!

855
01:25:25,203 --> 01:25:26,921
Heaven directed that shot.

856
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:29,837
Now you have blood on your soul!

857
01:25:36,298 --> 01:25:39,142
Don't you understand?
You didn't kill Roderick.

858
01:25:39,143 --> 01:25:41,677
You killed something inhuman!

859
01:25:41,678 --> 01:25:44,477
Don't you understand? It
could have killed both of us!

860
01:25:44,478 --> 01:25:47,266
- Yes I know!
- Yes, yes.

861
01:25:47,267 --> 01:25:49,018
You set us free.

862
01:25:49,019 --> 01:25:50,646
You have set us free!

863
01:25:51,647 --> 01:25:52,647
Yes.

864
01:25:53,065 --> 01:25:55,318
We'll bury the curse with him.

865
01:25:56,276 --> 01:25:57,653
You've set us free.

866
01:25:58,570 --> 01:26:00,743
Now we can leave this house.

867
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:03,913
Leave the curse behind us.

868
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:06,577
Yes.

869
01:26:06,578 --> 01:26:07,704
Yes.

870
01:26:41,446 --> 01:26:42,993
We'll be on our way, Bully Boy.

871
01:26:44,074 --> 01:26:45,950
You know where to stop first.

872
01:26:45,951 --> 01:26:46,952
Yes, my Lord.

873
01:26:47,911 --> 01:26:49,834
I want to see him once again.

874
01:26:50,956 --> 01:26:52,378
Dead.

875
01:27:46,052 --> 01:27:47,053
He's dead.

876
01:27:48,805 --> 01:27:50,899
He's dead, but I'm alive.

877
01:27:51,975 --> 01:27:53,522
What do you want for a mark?

878
01:27:54,144 --> 01:27:55,817
Whatever you can spell.

879
01:28:05,697 --> 01:28:07,745
Open it up, I'd
have another look.

880
01:28:09,409 --> 01:28:10,579
I shouldn't do that.

881
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:11,791
Well, he's dead isn't he?

882
01:28:11,792 --> 01:28:13,755
Open it or I'll
bury you with him.

883
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:29,887
You didn't kill him!

884
01:28:29,888 --> 01:28:30,889
He's dead.

885
01:28:31,890 --> 01:28:34,308
His head was blasted
from his body!

886
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:35,935
Where is he?

887
01:28:35,936 --> 01:28:37,483
You didn't kill him.

888
01:28:38,647 --> 01:28:40,231
Born by fire,

889
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:42,234
by fire must be consumed.

890
01:28:43,819 --> 01:28:45,366
He's dead.

891
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:47,493
Or is he?

892
01:28:48,156 --> 01:28:49,874
You didn't kill him.

893
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:15,730
I didn't kill him,
let's be on our way.

894
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:23,157
He's still alive.

895
01:29:24,609 --> 01:29:25,952
He isn't dead.

896
01:29:27,904 --> 01:29:29,497
You didn't kill him.

897
01:29:31,324 --> 01:29:33,033
Don't you understand?

898
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:34,832
You didn't kill him!

899
01:29:35,954 --> 01:29:38,038
You didn't kill him!

900
01:29:43,336 --> 01:29:44,588
Harry!

901
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:48,808
Harry?

902
01:29:55,557 --> 01:29:56,683
Bully Boy.

903
01:29:57,767 --> 01:29:58,767
Bully <i>Boy?</i>

904
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:00,816
Bully Boy!

905
01:30:01,938 --> 01:30:03,030
Bully Boy!

906
01:30:04,816 --> 01:30:05,817
Bully Boy.

907
01:30:07,152 --> 01:30:08,620
Bully Boy!

908
01:30:11,323 --> 01:30:12,745
Bully Boy!

909
01:30:15,535 --> 01:30:16,957
Bully Boy!

910
01:30:18,997 --> 01:30:20,795
Bully Boy!
