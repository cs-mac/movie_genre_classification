1
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,843
<i>During the spookiest time of the year...</i>

2
00:00:36,019 --> 00:00:39,785
<i>... there are a few guidelines</i>
<i>all ghosts and goblins should follow.</i>

3
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:41,947
<i>Always stay on sidewalks.</i>

4
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:46,323
<i>Never go to a stranger's house,</i>
<i>and never go out alone.</i>

5
00:01:06,883 --> 00:01:10,375
This is a great idea, honey. Really.

6
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,347
It's just magical.

7
00:01:12,756 --> 00:01:14,747
It makes me wish every night
was Halloween.

8
00:01:14,924 --> 00:01:16,755
I'm sorry, Em.

9
00:01:18,094 --> 00:01:19,686
- Wait, wait. Not yet.
- What?

10
00:01:19,863 --> 00:01:22,331
- You're supposed to keep it lit.
- Why?

11
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,091
Ancient tradition?

12
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:27,361
Henry, it's Halloween, not Hanukkah.

13
00:01:27,537 --> 00:01:29,698
- Baby, I'm lit and you're lit.
- But honey...

14
00:01:29,873 --> 00:01:32,398
But our little friend here?
His night's over.

15
00:01:34,778 --> 00:01:36,541
You know, you should be more careful.

16
00:01:36,713 --> 00:01:38,442
There are rules.
You might upset someone.

17
00:01:38,615 --> 00:01:41,175
Oh, please. Who?

18
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,160
What?

19
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,366
Inside. Upstairs.

20
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,601
Let's just take all this crap down.
It looks like a crime scene.

21
00:02:07,777 --> 00:02:10,211
- I told you I'd do it in the morning.
- No, you won't.

22
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,679
You're gonna sleep until noon
and then play video games until 4.

23
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:17,479
And besides, my mom is coming and
she'll have an aneurysm if she sees this.

24
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:18,916
Really?

25
00:02:20,123 --> 00:02:21,147
I'll do it.

26
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:33,259
Go inside. Put on the tape.

27
00:02:44,948 --> 00:02:47,542
I hate Halloween.

28
00:03:58,755 --> 00:04:00,552
What took you guys so long?

29
00:04:07,063 --> 00:04:08,428
Happy Halloween.

30
00:04:21,477 --> 00:04:25,777
<i>Yeah! Oh, baby!</i>

31
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:31,853
Henry!

32
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,891
Emma?

33
00:08:35,998 --> 00:08:39,661
<i>Werewolves, zombies</i>
<i>and demons of every variety.</i>

34
00:08:39,835 --> 00:08:40,927
<i>They've all descended...</i>

35
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:44,163
<i>... on the normally sleepy town</i>
<i>of Warren valley, Ohio...</i>

36
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,968
<i>... where the holiday</i>
<i>and all of its strange traditions...</i>

37
00:08:47,143 --> 00:08:49,202
<i>... are taken very seriously.</i>

38
00:08:49,378 --> 00:08:53,109
<i>It's only 8:00 and the streets are already</i>
<i>packed with costumed visitors...</i>

39
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,512
<i>... some to show off, others to blend in...</i>

40
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:58,677
<i>... but all to celebrate the magical night</i>
<i>of Halloween...</i>

41
00:08:58,854 --> 00:09:02,813
...the one night a year when we can pretend
to be the scariest thing we can think of.

42
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:11,557
I am not wearing this. It's too small.

43
00:09:11,734 --> 00:09:13,793
- My tits keep popping out.
- That's the idea.

44
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,064
Don't know why we drove here
when there are guys in the city.

45
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,229
Fresh meat.

46
00:09:18,407 --> 00:09:20,034
It's what we do every Halloween, Laurie.

47
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:21,676
Whatever happened to trick-or-treating?

48
00:09:21,844 --> 00:09:23,835
Puberty.
Last year we were in Tampa.

49
00:09:24,013 --> 00:09:25,173
And went as sexy nurses.

50
00:09:25,348 --> 00:09:28,943
No, Janet, Tampa was two
years ago. I remember because you puked...

51
00:09:29,118 --> 00:09:30,585
...doing a guy in his pickup.

52
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:33,085
I ate some bad Mexican,
and it was a Jeep.

53
00:09:33,256 --> 00:09:37,215
Last year was San Diego. We
dressed as sailors and ended up with sailors.

54
00:09:37,393 --> 00:09:39,554
Yeah, and Maria's sailor was a girl.

55
00:09:39,729 --> 00:09:44,666
So what? She had a nice ass.
It all tastes the same to me anyway.

56
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,597
Ladies, there are children out here.

57
00:09:48,304 --> 00:09:51,740
Okay, all of you come out
on the count of three. One, two, three.

58
00:09:57,546 --> 00:10:00,640
- Nice.
- Right.

59
00:10:05,755 --> 00:10:08,349
- Laurie, come on out.
- No.

60
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,116
- Open up.
- No.

61
00:10:10,293 --> 00:10:14,855
Open the door,
or we'll huff and we'll puff...

62
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,928
Come on, seriously, open up.

63
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,364
Fine, just don't laugh, okay?

64
00:10:30,413 --> 00:10:33,814
Danielle, I look like I'm 5.

65
00:10:33,983 --> 00:10:35,678
Shut up, you look great.

66
00:10:37,453 --> 00:10:38,977
- It's tradition.
- Great.

67
00:10:39,155 --> 00:10:42,613
- What does tradition say we do now?
- We meet our dates.

68
00:10:44,627 --> 00:10:46,925
Two thirty-three, 30-D.

69
00:10:47,463 --> 00:10:49,090
I mean, $234.33.

70
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:51,490
Thanks.

71
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:55,535
You know, this might sound kind of
forward, but well, we're just in town...

72
00:10:55,705 --> 00:10:59,141
...for a party tonight, and I was wondering
what time you get off work.

73
00:11:00,443 --> 00:11:01,842
Oh. Uh...

74
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:03,808
In about 20 minutes, actually.

75
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:06,140
Yeah? You know
where Sheep's Meadow is?

76
00:11:06,315 --> 00:11:07,612
Sure, yeah, of course.

77
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:10,081
All right. So why don't you
meet me there in 45?

78
00:11:10,986 --> 00:11:13,454
Okay, I guess.

79
00:11:13,956 --> 00:11:15,924
Don't forget your costume.

80
00:12:01,504 --> 00:12:04,496
That can't be good
for your diabetes, Charlie.

81
00:12:04,673 --> 00:12:06,004
Uh...

82
00:12:06,175 --> 00:12:08,700
Don't waste a good lie on this.

83
00:12:08,878 --> 00:12:10,368
It's just candy.

84
00:12:10,546 --> 00:12:12,514
Guess it's a good thing I got more.

85
00:12:12,681 --> 00:12:15,081
Why don't you sit down,
stay for a minute?

86
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:18,516
- Oh, I can't. I have...
- Sit down, Charlie.

87
00:12:19,855 --> 00:12:23,291
Your problem is simple.
You always wait for them to come to you.

88
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:27,657
If you just tried a little harder,
you wouldn't be a virgin at 22.

89
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,457
What? Excuse me?

90
00:12:29,632 --> 00:12:32,499
It's practically stapled to your forehead.

91
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:35,102
Laurie, please,
do not listen to them, okay?

92
00:12:35,271 --> 00:12:37,330
The key thing is to just be yourself.

93
00:12:38,107 --> 00:12:40,337
Being myself hasn't gotten me very far.

94
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:43,910
Maybe I'm too old-fashioned, but I've
always wanted my first time to be...

95
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,343
- No, please, don't say it.
- Special.

96
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:50,576
Honey, listen, we've all been there,
but you can't hesitate.

97
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:53,221
Watch.

98
00:12:58,994 --> 00:13:01,690
That's some big equipment
you've got there.

99
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:06,562
- Thank you.
- I'm Maria. This is Janet.

100
00:13:06,735 --> 00:13:09,670
- And we have a small problem.
- Really?

101
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,569
We've got this great party to go to...

102
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,602
But we don't have any dates.

103
00:13:21,484 --> 00:13:24,476
Here. Help yourself.

104
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,956
It's for the pumpkin, not you. Promise.

105
00:13:29,124 --> 00:13:30,955
All of mine were dull.

106
00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:42,836
Smashing jack-o'- lanterns?
Stealing candy?

107
00:13:43,005 --> 00:13:46,736
It's okay. Believe it or not,
I was just like you when I was a kid.

108
00:13:47,476 --> 00:13:49,603
Till my dad set me straight, that is.

109
00:13:49,778 --> 00:13:54,238
See, my dad taught me
tonight is about respecting the dead...

110
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,579
...because this is the one night
that the dead...

111
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:02,952
...and all sorts of other things roam free
and pay us a visit.

112
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,583
Sorry.

113
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:07,895
All these traditions...

114
00:14:08,063 --> 00:14:13,262
...jack-o'- lanterns, putting on costumes,
handing out treats...

115
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:17,633
...they were started to protect us,
but nowadays...

116
00:14:18,641 --> 00:14:20,871
...no one really cares.

117
00:14:21,043 --> 00:14:22,772
Yeah.

118
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,841
I didn't do such a good job, did I?

119
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,107
What do you think?

120
00:14:32,154 --> 00:14:33,644
Hey.

121
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:37,086
You okay?

122
00:14:38,093 --> 00:14:39,822
You need a root beer?

123
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,796
Oh, wait.

124
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,902
That's right. There's another tradition.

125
00:14:48,604 --> 00:14:51,038
A very important one.

126
00:14:52,841 --> 00:14:55,241
Always check your candy.

127
00:15:02,184 --> 00:15:03,981
Trick or...

128
00:15:40,956 --> 00:15:42,821
Ugh!

129
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,903
Trick or treat!

130
00:16:03,646 --> 00:16:06,410
We know you're in there.
We can see you.

131
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:11,849
Hello!
Just a minute!

132
00:16:17,426 --> 00:16:20,054
Wait. No, no. Shh!

133
00:16:23,932 --> 00:16:25,399
Great costume, Mr. Wilkins.

134
00:16:26,535 --> 00:16:28,935
Oy. Uh...

135
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,203
Oh, right, candy.

136
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:35,032
Thanks.

137
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:40,412
Principal Wilkins, do you think we might
be able to have your jack-o'- lantern, please?

138
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:46,282
- You're not gonna smash it, are you?
- No, it's a scavenger hunt for UNICEF.

139
00:16:47,122 --> 00:16:49,647
Anything for a good cause.

140
00:16:55,664 --> 00:16:57,996
Happy Halloween.

141
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,063
Yeah. Happy Halloween.

142
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,472
Didn't you get one?

143
00:17:21,724 --> 00:17:22,952
Are you sure about this?

144
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,184
There's gotta be one or two
extra guys there.

145
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,124
- I could help you.
- Go. I'll meet you there.

146
00:17:28,664 --> 00:17:30,222
Call me if you get into trouble.

147
00:17:30,399 --> 00:17:31,991
You're turning into Mom.

148
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:33,725
Ouch.

149
00:17:33,902 --> 00:17:37,360
- Just remember to be yourself.
- But play hard to get.

150
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:38,836
Goodbye, Danielle!

151
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,617
Happy Halloween.

152
00:18:29,124 --> 00:18:33,561
Daddy!
I'm back from trick-or-treating!

153
00:18:33,729 --> 00:18:35,128
Billy. Shh.

154
00:18:35,297 --> 00:18:37,765
- Please, be quiet.
- Why?

155
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:40,135
Because you'll bother the neighbors.

156
00:18:40,302 --> 00:18:43,499
Now go watch <i>Charlie Brown</i>
and I'll be in in a minute.

157
00:18:43,672 --> 00:18:48,268
- Charlie Brown's an asshole!
- Billy Wilkins. Language.

158
00:19:17,005 --> 00:19:18,939
Shh, shh, shh.

159
00:19:22,644 --> 00:19:24,271
Wait, hold on.

160
00:19:26,615 --> 00:19:28,640
Come on. There you...

161
00:19:32,988 --> 00:19:34,922
Huh? Mm.

162
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,284
Yeah.

163
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,756
Here you go. Go get it! Shit.

164
00:19:45,534 --> 00:19:47,161
Spite!

165
00:19:53,842 --> 00:19:56,538
Spite! Get your ass in here.

166
00:19:59,181 --> 00:20:00,580
Are you finished crapping or what?

167
00:20:02,985 --> 00:20:04,009
Who the hell is that?

168
00:20:06,054 --> 00:20:08,614
I got an NRA membership in my pocket...

169
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,054
...and a shotgun over the fireplace,
so get out...

170
00:20:11,226 --> 00:20:13,524
It's me, Mr. Kreeg.

171
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:16,357
Steven. Steven Wilkins.

172
00:20:16,531 --> 00:20:20,023
What in God's name are you doing
down there, Wilkins? Hiding bodies?

173
00:20:22,204 --> 00:20:23,193
What did you say?

174
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:25,597
Nothing.

175
00:20:25,774 --> 00:20:28,242
The septic tank is acting up.

176
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,311
- Is that what that smell is?
- I'm afraid so.

177
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,972
Then fix it!
It stinks like a dead whore out here.

178
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,016
I'm...

179
00:20:37,853 --> 00:20:39,150
...trying.

180
00:20:40,589 --> 00:20:42,557
Keep your kid out of my yard!

181
00:20:43,892 --> 00:20:45,826
Goddamn freak.

182
00:20:47,562 --> 00:20:50,827
- Happy Halloween.
- Screw you!

183
00:21:02,778 --> 00:21:04,245
Daddy!

184
00:21:04,413 --> 00:21:08,873
I wanna carve the jack-o'- lantern now,
but I need your help with the eyes.

185
00:21:09,051 --> 00:21:10,518
In a minute, Billy.

186
00:21:11,286 --> 00:21:13,720
And can I go to the parade
with you later?

187
00:21:13,889 --> 00:21:16,414
No, Daddy has a date.

188
00:21:16,591 --> 00:21:20,027
Oh! But we haven't done anything
fun together.

189
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:25,292
How about if we make some
caramel apples, just like Grandpa used to?

190
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:27,935
- How about that?
- When?

191
00:21:28,103 --> 00:21:33,769
After we carve the jack-o'- lantern,
but you have to be quiet.

192
00:21:33,942 --> 00:21:35,170
Okay.

193
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:45,448
But don't forget to help me
with the eyes!

194
00:21:59,534 --> 00:22:02,765
"Daddy, I wanna carve a pumpkin."

195
00:22:02,938 --> 00:22:05,771
"Daddy, I wanna go to the parade."

196
00:22:05,941 --> 00:22:09,274
"Daddy, I wish Mommy was still alive."

197
00:22:19,021 --> 00:22:22,923
Wilkins! Wilkins, over here! Wilkins!

198
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,422
Help me, goddamn it!

199
00:22:25,193 --> 00:22:26,626
Help me!

200
00:22:26,795 --> 00:22:29,696
- Help me!
- Screw you.

201
00:22:35,404 --> 00:22:38,202
Billy!

202
00:22:52,821 --> 00:22:54,721
Gotcha.

203
00:22:59,061 --> 00:23:00,995
So can we carve it now?

204
00:23:03,365 --> 00:23:05,230
Yeah.

205
00:23:06,068 --> 00:23:07,729
Let's go downstairs.

206
00:24:08,263 --> 00:24:12,097
Let's carve a scary face this time.

207
00:24:13,068 --> 00:24:15,696
A scary face it is.

208
00:24:35,624 --> 00:24:38,354
Wrap it around.

209
00:24:40,262 --> 00:24:44,028
But don't forget to help me
with the eyes.

210
00:24:59,714 --> 00:25:00,976
Trick or treat!

211
00:25:04,352 --> 00:25:07,150
Aren't you guys adorable?

212
00:25:07,322 --> 00:25:11,418
Thanks, Mrs. Henderson.
That's a great costume.

213
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:16,587
I know. Isn't it just "purr-fect"?

214
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,092
You want a drink or something?
It'll be our little secret.

215
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,831
- Sure.
- No, thanks. But...

216
00:25:26,007 --> 00:25:28,339
All right, fine. I'll see what I got for you.

217
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:33,072
Actually, Mrs. Henderson,
we were wondering if you might...

218
00:25:35,717 --> 00:25:37,617
- If you might...
- Holy shit.

219
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:41,552
...have a jack-o'- lantern we could borrow.

220
00:25:41,723 --> 00:25:43,953
Here you go.

221
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,685
Now, be safe...

222
00:25:48,063 --> 00:25:50,190
...and watch out for monsters.

223
00:25:52,534 --> 00:25:54,764
I don't even know what that was.

224
00:25:54,936 --> 00:25:58,929
Coach Taylor was in a hot-dog costume
butt-fucking a pig.

225
00:25:59,107 --> 00:26:02,201
- I think. And then...
- Chip. Let's just not.

226
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,884
- Trick or treat.
- What'd you find?

227
00:26:13,355 --> 00:26:14,481
That's it?

228
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,716
Sorry, but some asshole went
down the street smashing all of them.

229
00:26:17,892 --> 00:26:19,826
But we have three. Isn't this enough?

230
00:26:20,962 --> 00:26:22,156
Almost.

231
00:26:30,405 --> 00:26:32,202
Macy, why didn't we just start here?

232
00:26:32,374 --> 00:26:34,865
I didn't know she'd do this.

233
00:26:36,911 --> 00:26:38,003
This is weird.

234
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,239
Is that Rhonda the retard?

235
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:43,543
She's not a retard, she's an idiot savant.

236
00:26:43,718 --> 00:26:45,310
Here she comes.

237
00:26:49,224 --> 00:26:50,248
You're on, Schrader.

238
00:27:01,603 --> 00:27:03,730
Did you carve all these yourself?

239
00:27:04,773 --> 00:27:09,073
Yeah. Made my costume too.
Like it?

240
00:27:09,244 --> 00:27:10,643
I do.

241
00:27:11,846 --> 00:27:13,746
I'm Schrader.

242
00:27:14,449 --> 00:27:16,314
Rhonda.

243
00:27:43,845 --> 00:27:45,278
Let's get another drink.

244
00:29:07,128 --> 00:29:08,390
Henry.

245
00:29:10,932 --> 00:29:13,867
- I need help.
- She's just drunk, baby. Come on.

246
00:30:13,862 --> 00:30:15,830
You must really like Halloween.

247
00:30:15,997 --> 00:30:19,228
- You mean Samhain?
- What?

248
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,393
Samhain, also known as All Hallows' Eve,
also known as Halloween.

249
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,937
Pre-dating Christianity,
the Celtic holiday...

250
00:30:26,107 --> 00:30:29,076
...was celebrated on the one
night between autumn and winter...

251
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,940
...when the barrier between living
and dead was thinnest...

252
00:30:32,113 --> 00:30:36,106
...and often involved rituals
that included human sacrifice.

253
00:30:40,555 --> 00:30:42,682
I like your eye patch.

254
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,282
Oh.

255
00:31:12,353 --> 00:31:15,880
Great, a rock quarry.
Nice way to celebrate Halloween, Macy.

256
00:31:16,057 --> 00:31:19,117
- Why are we here?
- To pay our respects to the dead.

257
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,956
What happened? Did somebody die here?

258
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,188
Wait.

259
00:31:23,865 --> 00:31:24,957
Is this where...?

260
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:29,194
- It is, isn't it? This is where that school...
- Shut up, Sara.

261
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:30,962
The Halloween School Bus Massacre.

262
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:34,131
- Just don't call it that.
- What's she talking about?

263
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,641
It's this awesome town legend.
There was this bus...

264
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:39,371
Jesus, will you shut up
and let me tell the damn story?

265
00:31:41,015 --> 00:31:42,676
You said a bad word.

266
00:31:48,222 --> 00:31:50,713
It happened 30 years ago...

267
00:31:50,892 --> 00:31:55,386
...on a late Halloween afternoon.

268
00:32:03,638 --> 00:32:06,505
<i>A school bus was on its usual route.</i>

269
00:32:08,242 --> 00:32:11,268
<i>But this wasn't your typical school bus...</i>

270
00:32:11,779 --> 00:32:14,577
<i>... and they weren't your typical kids.</i>

271
00:32:20,822 --> 00:32:22,517
<i>There were eight of them...</i>

272
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:24,849
<i>... and they were different.</i>

273
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,927
<i>Troubled.</i>

274
00:32:27,095 --> 00:32:28,528
<i>Disturbed.</i>

275
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:33,731
<i>Every day, parents put their dirty secrets</i>
<i>on this bus...</i>

276
00:32:33,901 --> 00:32:36,165
<i>... to be driven to a school</i>
<i>miles outside of town.</i>

277
00:32:36,337 --> 00:32:39,738
3260.

278
00:32:39,907 --> 00:32:43,741
3264.

279
00:32:43,911 --> 00:32:47,438
3266.

280
00:32:50,284 --> 00:32:52,047
<i>But that day...</i>

281
00:32:54,088 --> 00:32:55,885
<i>... the driver took a different route.</i>

282
00:33:04,365 --> 00:33:06,128
Wrong way.

283
00:33:06,534 --> 00:33:07,558
Wrong way.

284
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,604
Wrong way.

285
00:33:16,978 --> 00:33:18,843
<i>And instead of</i>
<i>taking the students home...</i>

286
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:24,010
<i>... he drove the bus</i>
<i>to an abandoned rock quarry.</i>

287
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:28,117
This rock quarry.

288
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:45,031
<i>The kids didn't know that over the years,</i>
<i>their parents had become exhausted...</i>

289
00:33:45,206 --> 00:33:46,969
<i>... embarrassed.</i>

290
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:56,808
<i>And they were willing to do anything</i>
<i>to ease their burden.</i>

291
00:34:00,354 --> 00:34:04,791
<i>So one day, the parents approached</i>
<i>the bus driver and made him an offer.</i>

292
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:15,291
Shh.

293
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:20,066
<i>With the money they collected together,</i>
<i>they asked him to do the unthinkable.</i>

294
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:36,312
<i>It almost worked perfectly.</i>

295
00:34:37,759 --> 00:34:39,522
Wrong way.

296
00:34:40,762 --> 00:34:42,423
Wrong way.

297
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,567
Home. Home.

298
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:50,562
I wanna go home.

299
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:54,565
I wanna go home.

300
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,544
Home.

301
00:35:10,258 --> 00:35:12,089
Home. Home.

302
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:18,127
Home! Go home!

303
00:35:20,268 --> 00:35:21,826
Home.

304
00:36:00,608 --> 00:36:03,099
<i>The driver was never heard from again.</i>

305
00:36:20,628 --> 00:36:26,692
<i>As for the bus, some say</i>
<i>it sank so deep that it couldn't be found.</i>

306
00:36:26,868 --> 00:36:30,167
<i>Others say the town</i>
<i>just didn't want it to be found.</i>

307
00:36:31,572 --> 00:36:34,200
For all we know, it's still down there...

308
00:36:35,309 --> 00:36:38,039
...and so are those kids.

309
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:47,117
You are so full of shit.

310
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,755
Really?

311
00:36:48,923 --> 00:36:50,754
Then I guess
you won't mind being first.

312
00:36:50,925 --> 00:36:52,756
First what?

313
00:36:52,927 --> 00:36:56,658
Eight victims, eight jack-o'- lanterns...

314
00:36:57,031 --> 00:36:59,829
...each one representing a lost soul.

315
00:37:00,001 --> 00:37:02,936
So we're going to leave them
by the side of the lake...

316
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,901
...as an offering to those who died.

317
00:37:07,541 --> 00:37:09,566
Oh.

318
00:37:34,368 --> 00:37:36,097
Is that one of yours?

319
00:37:37,305 --> 00:37:38,966
Yes.

320
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,664
It's very pretty.

321
00:37:41,909 --> 00:37:43,672
Thank you.

322
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,466
It can only hold three safely.

323
00:38:07,401 --> 00:38:11,235
I'll send the keys back up.
You guys bring the rest.

324
00:38:11,405 --> 00:38:13,236
Uh... Okay.

325
00:39:00,955 --> 00:39:02,684
I can't do this.
If you put me in a box...

326
00:39:04,025 --> 00:39:05,583
...it makes me feel like
you're not proud of me.

327
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,887
If you're not proud of me...

328
00:39:08,729 --> 00:39:11,289
- Hello?
- Who's your favorite big sister?

329
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:17,297
<i>You there?</i>

330
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,002
Yeah. Hi.

331
00:39:21,175 --> 00:39:24,144
So there's a guy here
who really wants to meet you.

332
00:39:24,311 --> 00:39:25,835
Is he young? Cute?

333
00:39:27,581 --> 00:39:29,879
Uh... Yeah.
Yeah, no, you could say that.

334
00:39:30,051 --> 00:39:32,178
<i>He's really, really nice.</i>

335
00:39:32,353 --> 00:39:33,877
So he's hideous.

336
00:39:34,055 --> 00:39:37,957
Just get your ass over here.
Beggars can't be choosers.

337
00:39:42,263 --> 00:39:43,457
Nice.

338
00:39:44,765 --> 00:39:46,130
Great.

339
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,961
Not now, Andrew.

340
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,433
- Josh.
- Whatever.

341
00:39:56,877 --> 00:39:58,868
Werewolves.

342
00:40:01,382 --> 00:40:02,872
Very funny.

343
00:40:16,764 --> 00:40:19,426
That bus is around here somewhere.
I think it's over here.

344
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,967
Over where? I can't see shit
in this fog. Think I found a dead retard.

345
00:40:23,137 --> 00:40:25,731
That's me, asshole.
Like I said.

346
00:40:25,906 --> 00:40:28,534
Both of you shut up and keep looking.

347
00:40:28,709 --> 00:40:30,836
There's something moving by that rock.

348
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:33,104
I can't see.
Jesus, what is that?

349
00:40:34,448 --> 00:40:35,472
Help me!

350
00:40:35,649 --> 00:40:38,413
Sara! Where's Sara?

351
00:40:39,587 --> 00:40:41,077
Run!

352
00:40:41,255 --> 00:40:44,190
There's nowhere to go.
Up! I wanna go back up!

353
00:41:00,174 --> 00:41:03,632
Macy? Schrader? Sara?

354
00:41:22,596 --> 00:41:25,895
Aren't you coming? Okay, stay here.

355
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:29,558
Don't let the candles go out
and they'll protect you, okay?

356
00:44:35,723 --> 00:44:37,657
Oh, shit.

357
00:44:41,695 --> 00:44:43,287
Is she dead?

358
00:44:43,464 --> 00:44:44,931
Hey.

359
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:51,233
Rhonda.

360
00:44:52,072 --> 00:44:53,835
Rhonda.

361
00:45:07,087 --> 00:45:08,952
It was all going so well.

362
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,988
- You're all dead!
- Rhonda, calm down.

363
00:45:14,161 --> 00:45:16,288
It was all just a trick.

364
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:20,422
Look, none of this is real.
It was just a trick.

365
00:45:21,168 --> 00:45:24,160
- A bad joke.
- I'd say it was a pretty good one.

366
00:45:24,605 --> 00:45:25,970
Shut up.

367
00:45:30,844 --> 00:45:31,902
Here, let me see.

368
00:45:36,884 --> 00:45:38,613
Does it hurt?

369
00:45:46,894 --> 00:45:49,226
- Go pack everything up. We're leaving.
- Says who?

370
00:45:49,396 --> 00:45:53,696
Macy, she's scared out of her mind.
What else do you want?

371
00:45:58,405 --> 00:45:59,736
Let's go.

372
00:46:06,573 --> 00:46:08,768
This one's still lit.

373
00:46:16,683 --> 00:46:20,210
If this was all a trick,
then how did the school bus get here?

374
00:46:20,387 --> 00:46:23,754
- That part's true.
- What happened to the bus driver?

375
00:46:23,924 --> 00:46:25,414
I don't know, Chip.

376
00:46:27,227 --> 00:46:30,094
- What?
- I didn't say anything.

377
00:46:32,065 --> 00:46:35,728
- I'm not in the mood.
- It wasn't me.

378
00:46:38,905 --> 00:46:40,031
What is that?

379
00:46:48,715 --> 00:46:51,445
- Schrader!
- Not again.

380
00:46:52,953 --> 00:46:55,888
- Over here!
- Wait here.

381
00:46:57,858 --> 00:46:59,291
Help us!

382
00:47:00,493 --> 00:47:02,393
Schrader!

383
00:47:12,105 --> 00:47:14,005
- Schrader!
- What the hell?

384
00:47:14,174 --> 00:47:16,199
We have to go.
We have to get out of here.

385
00:47:16,376 --> 00:47:18,173
- Calm down.
- We have to go!

386
00:47:18,345 --> 00:47:19,607
- Look, Macy...
- Listen to me!

387
00:47:19,779 --> 00:47:22,612
We heard voices.
There are other people here.

388
00:47:28,321 --> 00:47:29,686
What is that?

389
00:47:54,547 --> 00:47:55,844
Help me! Help me!

390
00:47:58,051 --> 00:48:00,611
No. Run.

391
00:48:05,492 --> 00:48:06,959
Rhonda, open the gate.

392
00:48:07,127 --> 00:48:08,890
- Let us in, please!
- Open the gate!

393
00:48:10,997 --> 00:48:12,055
Open the gate, please.

394
00:48:20,106 --> 00:48:21,164
Come on.

395
00:48:25,078 --> 00:48:27,137
Open the gate.

396
00:48:31,251 --> 00:48:33,811
- No! Rhonda, look at me.
- What are you doing?

397
00:48:33,987 --> 00:48:36,319
It's not a trick, it's real.

398
00:48:36,489 --> 00:48:37,649
Come back!

399
00:48:39,059 --> 00:48:42,517
Where is she going?
Rhonda!

400
00:48:42,696 --> 00:48:44,664
- No, no!
- It's not a trick!

401
00:49:08,855 --> 00:49:11,085
Help me, please!

402
00:50:03,676 --> 00:50:06,440
I'm not in the mood,
so just come on out.

403
00:50:19,893 --> 00:50:22,885
Oh, my God. She's so funny.

404
00:50:26,633 --> 00:50:28,123
No, thanks.

405
00:50:29,836 --> 00:50:32,100
She's a big girl.
She can take care of herself.

406
00:50:33,006 --> 00:50:35,031
I wish that were true.

407
00:50:35,208 --> 00:50:37,802
Mom always said
she was the runt of the litter.

408
00:50:46,586 --> 00:50:49,077
My, my...

409
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:53,419
...what big eyes you have.

410
00:50:56,629 --> 00:50:58,995
So where's this guy
you're setting her up with?

411
00:50:59,165 --> 00:51:00,223
The nice one?

412
00:51:13,913 --> 00:51:15,403
Laurie.

413
00:51:39,973 --> 00:51:41,497
Oh, my God.

414
00:51:45,845 --> 00:51:49,008
Please, help me.

415
00:52:06,232 --> 00:52:07,961
There she is.

416
00:52:09,869 --> 00:52:11,461
Laurie, what's going on?

417
00:52:12,138 --> 00:52:13,469
You're late.

418
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:17,142
Sorry. It took longer than I thought.

419
00:52:17,877 --> 00:52:19,777
What did he do to you?

420
00:52:20,647 --> 00:52:24,606
I listened to their advice
and played hard to get. He bit me.

421
00:52:28,388 --> 00:52:31,755
Well, at least you made it. Drink?

422
00:52:33,026 --> 00:52:34,391
Sure.

423
00:52:37,697 --> 00:52:39,392
Come here.

424
00:52:41,501 --> 00:52:44,698
- Please.
- Say "ah."

425
00:52:55,949 --> 00:52:57,473
Not bad.

426
00:53:01,487 --> 00:53:03,011
What's your name, honey?

427
00:53:04,657 --> 00:53:06,022
Steven.

428
00:53:06,192 --> 00:53:08,820
- Steven?
- Steven Wilkins.

429
00:53:08,995 --> 00:53:13,091
I'm glad you're her first, I really am.
I like you.

430
00:53:13,833 --> 00:53:15,528
Who are you people?

431
00:53:49,269 --> 00:53:51,066
I'm nervous.

432
00:53:52,872 --> 00:53:54,134
Hey.

433
00:53:55,408 --> 00:53:57,535
You're gonna be fine.

434
00:53:57,910 --> 00:54:00,071
Just be yourself.

435
00:54:20,533 --> 00:54:23,093
It's my first time...

436
00:54:23,603 --> 00:54:26,197
...so just bear with me.

437
00:55:14,187 --> 00:55:15,552
What are you doing?

438
00:55:53,626 --> 00:55:55,617
My, my...

439
00:55:55,795 --> 00:56:00,596
...what big eyes you have.

440
00:57:39,799 --> 00:57:42,996
Trick or treat.

441
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,172
<i>You push it in, you slide the food in.</i>

442
00:58:57,343 --> 00:58:59,641
<i>It pops right out, okay?</i>

443
00:58:59,812 --> 00:59:04,374
<i>I'm gonna take this device.</i>
<i>I've done it three times already, inside.</i>

444
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:07,519
<i>I'm gonna show the folks</i>
<i>how to put it on the spit rod.</i>

445
00:59:07,687 --> 00:59:09,484
<i>It's so darn easy.</i>

446
00:59:09,655 --> 00:59:13,819
<i>I take the meat, and all I'm gonna do</i>
<i>is just center it like this.</i>

447
00:59:13,993 --> 00:59:15,153
<i>It goes down.</i>

448
00:59:16,963 --> 00:59:19,193
<i>I'll put the wheel on.</i>
<i>It's as simple as this.</i>

449
00:59:19,365 --> 00:59:22,129
<i>This is about a 7-pound</i>
<i>pork loin roast.</i>

450
00:59:22,301 --> 00:59:27,204
<i>I'll put it in the machine, I'll slide it back,</i>
<i>put up the window.</i>

451
00:59:27,406 --> 00:59:30,000
- <i>You set it, and?</i>
- <i>Forget it!</i>

452
00:59:30,176 --> 00:59:33,509
<i>Right. I'm gonna go over</i>
<i>to the pork loin roast over here now...</i>

453
00:59:34,814 --> 00:59:38,215
<i>... and I'm gonna take this one out.</i>
<i>This has been done...</i>

454
00:59:38,384 --> 00:59:41,319
<i>It's only 8:00, and the streets</i>
<i>are packed with visitors...</i>

455
00:59:41,487 --> 00:59:43,478
<i>... some to show off, others to blend in...</i>

456
00:59:43,656 --> 00:59:46,318
<i>... but all to celebrate the magical night</i>
<i>of Halloween.</i>

457
00:59:54,567 --> 00:59:57,798
MAN <i>2:baked goods and crops</i>
<i>were left out as offerings for the dead...</i>

458
00:59:57,970 --> 00:59:59,938
<i>... a custom now known</i>
<i>as trick-or-treating.</i>

459
01:00:00,106 --> 01:00:01,767
Christ.

460
01:00:01,941 --> 01:00:03,909
<i>Revolutionary. Now look.</i>

461
01:00:04,076 --> 01:00:07,910
<i>Let me just start cutting this over here</i>
<i>so that folks can see.</i>

462
01:00:08,714 --> 01:00:10,705
<i>This beautiful? Look at this</i>
<i>over here, folks, huh?</i>

463
01:00:12,385 --> 01:00:14,853
<i>Look how beautiful that pork looks</i>
<i>with all its injected flavors on the...</i>

464
01:00:58,130 --> 01:01:00,394
Happy Halloween.

465
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:06,031
Spite?

466
01:01:06,639 --> 01:01:07,970
Spite.

467
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:24,520
Spite. Get your ass in here.

468
01:01:31,797 --> 01:01:34,231
Are you finished crapping or what?

469
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:39,595
Who the hell is that?

470
01:01:41,874 --> 01:01:44,468
I've got an NRA membership
in my pocket...

471
01:01:44,643 --> 01:01:47,942
...and a shotgun over the fireplace,
so get out of here before I...

472
01:01:48,114 --> 01:01:50,878
It's me, Mr. Kreeg.

473
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:52,847
Steven. Steven Wilkins.

474
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:59,548
What in God's name are you doing
down there, Wilkins? Hiding bodies?

475
01:02:03,629 --> 01:02:05,358
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

476
01:02:05,564 --> 01:02:07,532
The septic tank is acting up.

477
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,133
Well, fix it!

478
01:02:09,301 --> 01:02:11,565
It stinks like a dead whore out here.

479
01:02:11,737 --> 01:02:14,934
I'm trying.

480
01:02:15,107 --> 01:02:16,972
Keep your kid out of my yard!

481
01:02:17,777 --> 01:02:20,041
Goddamn freak.

482
01:02:23,082 --> 01:02:24,913
Happy Halloween.

483
01:02:25,084 --> 01:02:27,075
Screw you!

484
01:02:43,803 --> 01:02:45,862
Get the hell off my!

485
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:46,625
Well, zip-a-dee-doo-dah.

486
01:04:00,012 --> 01:04:01,570
Spite?

487
01:04:35,614 --> 01:04:37,206
Spite?

488
01:06:41,774 --> 01:06:43,935
Who the hell are you?

489
01:08:32,651 --> 01:08:35,245
Wilkins! Wilkins!

490
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:39,823
Over here! Wilkins!
Wilkins, help me, goddamn it!

491
01:08:39,992 --> 01:08:42,552
Help me! Wilkins!

492
01:08:42,728 --> 01:08:44,059
Help me!

493
01:09:14,159 --> 01:09:15,183
Huh?

494
01:10:20,892 --> 01:10:24,419
- <i>911, please hold.</i>
- Hello? Hello?

495
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,831
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>

496
01:10:30,002 --> 01:10:32,971
Yeah, I'd like to report...

497
01:10:33,138 --> 01:10:37,973
Hello? Hello? Hello?

498
01:11:10,942 --> 01:11:14,036
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

499
01:12:02,728 --> 01:12:04,889
Oh, no.

500
01:14:58,670 --> 01:15:00,638
Trick or treat.

501
01:15:05,977 --> 01:15:07,501
Thank you.

502
01:15:10,148 --> 01:15:11,877
Thank you.

503
01:15:15,353 --> 01:15:19,346
Thanks, Mr. Kreeg.
Great mummy costume.

504
01:15:42,447 --> 01:15:43,880
Thank you.

505
01:16:16,615 --> 01:16:19,049
This was a great idea, honey.

506
01:16:19,584 --> 01:16:23,145
It's just magical. It makes me wish
every night was Halloween.

507
01:16:25,824 --> 01:16:29,282
I'm sorry, Em. Wait, wait. Not yet.

508
01:16:30,862 --> 01:16:33,262
- What?
- You're supposed to keep it lit.

509
01:16:33,431 --> 01:16:35,729
- Why?
- Ancient tradition?

510
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:40,530
Henry, it's Halloween, not Hanukkah.
Baby, I'm lit, and you're lit.

511
01:16:40,705 --> 01:16:44,402
But your little friend here?
His night's over.

512
01:16:45,877 --> 01:16:47,640
You know, you should be more careful.

513
01:16:47,812 --> 01:16:50,178
There are rules. You might upset someone.

514
01:16:50,348 --> 01:16:52,976
Oh, please. Who?

515
01:17:16,408 --> 01:17:19,935
Over here.

516
01:17:27,352 --> 01:17:29,081
Trick or treat.
