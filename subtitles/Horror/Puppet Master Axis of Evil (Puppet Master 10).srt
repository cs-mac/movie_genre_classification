1
00:00:05,292 --> 00:00:09,682
<i>My friends live in the monster's house.</i>

2
00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:17,742
<i>My friends, who I love like my own life.</i>

3
00:00:19,312 --> 00:00:22,522
<i>Friends who saved my life.</i>

4
00:00:26,422 --> 00:00:32,392
<i>Also, at the monster's house,
the monster lives too.</i>

5
00:00:38,652 --> 00:00:42,962
<i>Why is Tae Ha here? Just why?</i>

6
00:01:00,112 --> 00:01:02,831
<i>Myeong, why are you here...</i>

7
00:01:02,832 --> 00:01:05,792
Let's go somewhere else. This
isn't the place to talk.

8
00:01:10,372 --> 00:01:13,411
<i>Don't you be mistaken,</i>

9
00:01:13,412 --> 00:01:17,441
<i>I can't even sleep well
worrying that you'll harm me.</i>

10
00:01:17,442 --> 00:01:20,401
<i>A kidnapper would do anything.</i>

11
00:01:20,402 --> 00:01:22,572
<i>You say it's meaningless?</i>

12
00:01:24,142 --> 00:01:29,681
<i>No If you're a human being
you can't say such things.</i>

13
00:01:29,682 --> 00:01:34,001
<i>Because of your meaningless
deeds, I've been living in hell.</i>

14
00:01:34,002 --> 00:01:35,862
<i>Do you know that?!</i>

15
00:01:36,942 --> 00:01:39,381
You should try knocking.

16
00:01:39,382 --> 00:01:41,941
I knocked twice.

17
00:01:41,942 --> 00:01:46,881
This reminds me of when you used my
makeup in secret and I found out.

18
00:01:46,882 --> 00:01:51,561
You hid the lipstick behind
your back and denied it.

19
00:01:51,562 --> 00:01:53,241
When did I do that?

20
00:01:53,242 --> 00:02:01,242
You did when you were a kid, that's why there were
no secrets as you had it written on your face.

21
00:02:01,562 --> 00:02:04,141
Why did come here at this late night?

22
00:02:04,142 --> 00:02:11,701
To see Da Hae. I thought she was in here as
I heard her voice. I guess she isn't here.

23
00:02:11,702 --> 00:02:19,702
What Da Hae's voice? Oh yea, while we
are talking, let me ask you something.

24
00:02:19,842 --> 00:02:24,621
Ma'am, how much do you know about Da Hae?

25
00:02:24,622 --> 00:02:32,602
Who should be asking who? You're
the one who brought her in.

26
00:02:40,442 --> 00:02:42,581
I'm sorry I couldn't come
when you were released.

27
00:02:42,582 --> 00:02:47,042
You must've had a reason, so it's okay.

28
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:53,801
Come out of Goong Rak Won. Everything happened
after the noodle master came to the orphanage.

29
00:02:53,802 --> 00:03:00,861
You going to Masan, me seeing you there and even
today. Everything is connected to that place.

30
00:03:00,862 --> 00:03:05,561
So stop now. It's dangerous for you.

31
00:03:05,562 --> 00:03:12,522
My parents were killed
right in front of my eyes.

32
00:03:15,142 --> 00:03:17,642
Being burnt to death at that.

33
00:03:19,402 --> 00:03:25,142
Noodle Master, Hwa Jung Tae
is the one who did it.

34
00:03:26,382 --> 00:03:33,402
I have the nightmare every time I close my
eyes. I haven't had a good nights rest ever.

35
00:03:34,122 --> 00:03:38,482
The person who killed my parents are in front
of me, how can I pretend not to see him?

36
00:03:40,082 --> 00:03:45,922
I've come to far. I can't stop now Tae Ha.

37
00:03:46,982 --> 00:03:52,482
Right now, I'm doing what
I am supposed to do.

38
00:03:59,942 --> 00:04:03,142
Did you see Yeo Gyeong?

39
00:04:04,762 --> 00:04:05,881
No.

40
00:04:05,882 --> 00:04:11,041
Go met her. Guilt won't
go away from avoidance.

41
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,521
It grows imaginably.

42
00:04:13,522 --> 00:04:17,461
Also, I don't know why you came her,

43
00:04:17,462 --> 00:04:21,922
but I would like it if you
don't come there anymore.

44
00:04:23,082 --> 00:04:25,161
I'm leaving.

45
00:04:25,162 --> 00:04:27,542
You can't handle that.

46
00:04:28,522 --> 00:04:32,661
That person, he isn't someone
you can handle by yourself.

47
00:04:32,662 --> 00:04:38,621
There are times to fight even if you know
you'll lose. This has become like this to me.

48
00:04:38,622 --> 00:04:42,021
It's not just losing,
You could end up dead!

49
00:04:42,022 --> 00:04:44,222
Thank you for the advice.

50
00:05:15,562 --> 00:05:16,382
You've come.

51
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:19,701
This dough isn't done by one person.

52
00:05:19,702 --> 00:05:24,701
You have to put the hot water over the buckwheat mix
and knead fast in order to avoid getting burned.

53
00:05:24,702 --> 00:05:27,362
You are working very
hard even at this hour.

54
00:05:30,082 --> 00:05:35,061
The more I get to know you the
more of a mystery you are to me.

55
00:05:35,062 --> 00:05:40,021
Having a conversation with the
noodle master as a mere errand girl.

56
00:05:40,022 --> 00:05:43,742
Going in and out of Madan Go's heart.

57
00:05:44,522 --> 00:05:47,941
You are very interesting,

58
00:05:47,942 --> 00:05:54,082
I don't why you're saying that, but
it's better than not being fun.

59
00:06:06,962 --> 00:06:08,061
What is this?

60
00:06:08,062 --> 00:06:10,522
Blueprint of Goong Rak Won.

61
00:06:14,862 --> 00:06:19,121
There is a secret room inside the
noodle master's office. Get inside.

62
00:06:19,122 --> 00:06:19,962
Are you sure?

63
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:23,901
It's half the size of the
noodle master's office.

64
00:06:23,902 --> 00:06:26,882
There has to be another place.

65
00:06:27,862 --> 00:06:34,362
Who knows? The reason you're
here might be in there?

66
00:06:40,602 --> 00:06:43,501
Did I just get suspended?

67
00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:47,721
Since we don't have assigned cases, suspension
seems right... without a dock in pay.

68
00:06:47,722 --> 00:06:50,501
Who cares if we come to the Special
Investigative Team? There's nothing to do.

69
00:06:50,502 --> 00:06:52,761
Detective Kim... as for Goong Rak Won...

70
00:06:52,762 --> 00:06:55,481
Why don't you stop doing the work
that doesn't help our group?

71
00:06:55,482 --> 00:07:00,001
If you continue to dig the suspended
case, you'll be the only one to suffer.

72
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:03,601
On top of that, you're part of the
Special Investigative Team, Prosecutor.

73
00:07:03,602 --> 00:07:06,961
If you touch Criminal Investigative
Team case, you'll hear an earful.

74
00:07:06,962 --> 00:07:10,481
I see a nail sticking out.
How can I just ignore it?

75
00:07:10,482 --> 00:07:14,141
Whether we rip out the root,
smash it or do something.

76
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,581
<i>That's right!</i>

77
00:07:16,582 --> 00:07:20,561
Rip out the crime and catch the criminals.

78
00:07:20,562 --> 00:07:21,681
Prosecutor.

79
00:07:21,682 --> 00:07:24,301
Prosecutor Chae, have you eaten?

80
00:07:24,302 --> 00:07:25,521
I have.

81
00:07:25,522 --> 00:07:27,081
Let's go eat noodles!

82
00:07:27,082 --> 00:07:29,161
I said I just ate.

83
00:07:29,162 --> 00:07:31,341
That's why, let's go eat noodles.

84
00:07:31,342 --> 00:07:32,781
Prosecutor.

85
00:07:32,782 --> 00:07:37,842
It's an order! Let's go eat
noodles, Prosecutor Chae.

86
00:07:53,242 --> 00:07:56,262
Prosecutor Chae Yeo Gyeong.

87
00:07:58,082 --> 00:08:00,081
It's nice to meet you.

88
00:08:00,082 --> 00:08:02,602
I'm So Tae Seop.

89
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:10,081
You're curious why I called you, right?

90
00:08:10,082 --> 00:08:13,801
More than that, this feels uncomfortable.

91
00:08:13,802 --> 00:08:20,482
You look like him. Your eyes, nose,
and lips. You look just like him.

92
00:08:23,242 --> 00:08:27,181
May I speak informally to you?

93
00:08:27,182 --> 00:08:33,781
It's embarrassing speaking formally
to my younger brother's daughter.

94
00:08:33,782 --> 00:08:37,841
Younger brother's daughter?

95
00:08:37,842 --> 00:08:43,941
Professor Chae Il Hwan,
isn't he your father?

96
00:08:43,942 --> 00:08:48,502
Do you know my father?

97
00:09:02,562 --> 00:09:09,801
He was a lieutenant under me. He joined the army reserve and
became a professor at the Agency for Defense Development.

98
00:09:09,802 --> 00:09:12,162
I went into politics.

99
00:09:13,102 --> 00:09:21,102
You've grown up well. Your
father will be very proud.

100
00:09:23,382 --> 00:09:25,782
Keep it.

101
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:33,721
It's better you carry that than me.

102
00:09:33,722 --> 00:09:38,341
Let's have a bowl of rice soup together.

103
00:09:38,342 --> 00:09:43,892
When I miss your father, I'll call you out.

104
00:09:46,112 --> 00:09:48,282
Thank you.

105
00:09:58,512 --> 00:10:01,912
You... Do you know Doggoo?

106
00:10:02,622 --> 00:10:06,441
That guy... he's a thug.

107
00:10:06,442 --> 00:10:11,451
He has his own business and helps
out with the foundation...

108
00:10:11,452 --> 00:10:13,381
He seems quite busy.

109
00:10:13,382 --> 00:10:18,881
If you dig, wouldn't some
interesting things come out of him?

110
00:10:18,882 --> 00:10:22,631
I was ordered to stop investigating
into relevant matters.

111
00:10:22,632 --> 00:10:27,811
Since it's a Criminal Investigation Team case, it's hard
for the Special Investigative Team to get involved.

112
00:10:27,812 --> 00:10:32,331
Does it make sense to pick and choose precinct
and divisions in catching a criminal?

113
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,912
What do you think about that?

114
00:10:59,972 --> 00:11:02,351
You were alive.

115
00:11:02,352 --> 00:11:06,252
Since you didn't call, I
thought you forgot about me.

116
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:10,341
Did anyone follow you?

117
00:11:10,342 --> 00:11:14,871
The Noodle Master? He
hasn't come by lately.

118
00:11:14,872 --> 00:11:18,491
He had me for 3 years so
he's probably sick of me.

119
00:11:18,492 --> 00:11:21,342
How long have I known you?

120
00:11:23,602 --> 00:11:25,201
8 years.

121
00:11:25,202 --> 00:11:28,192
I still don't trust you.

122
00:11:29,102 --> 00:11:31,382
Why should you?

123
00:11:32,122 --> 00:11:33,441
Noodle Master?

124
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:36,551
He's busy with Goong Rak Won these days.

125
00:11:36,552 --> 00:11:41,471
I worry that he won't want to
get into politics this way.

126
00:11:41,472 --> 00:11:43,861
Didn't I write you a scenario?

127
00:11:43,862 --> 00:11:48,931
Just don't miss a word and just act your
part. Then everything will work out.

128
00:11:48,932 --> 00:11:52,782
And I wasted three years.

129
00:11:55,012 --> 00:11:59,001
There will be a talk show for
the next spring programming.

130
00:11:59,002 --> 00:12:00,962
Over the air broadcasting.

131
00:12:26,632 --> 00:12:28,461
Why? What's the matter?

132
00:12:28,462 --> 00:12:29,671
About what?

133
00:12:29,672 --> 00:12:32,291
You're being watchful of me right now.

134
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:35,271
Did you enjoy the rice soup?

135
00:12:35,272 --> 00:12:38,012
What did he say?

136
00:12:39,042 --> 00:12:42,541
That's right. That must be right!

137
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:45,011
Our prosecutor... she's still got it!

138
00:12:45,012 --> 00:12:47,291
We met, I ate the rice soup.

139
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:49,821
He gave me some advices, so
I was all ears. Satisfied?

140
00:12:49,822 --> 00:12:52,341
Do you know which line our
prosecutor is connected to?

141
00:12:52,342 --> 00:12:57,931
Prosecutor General, Deputy Inspector... everyone climbed
the ladder holding onto Senator So Tae Seop's line.

142
00:12:57,932 --> 00:13:01,891
- So? - For the new recruit
to eat with that person...

143
00:13:01,892 --> 00:13:03,871
Autobahn... smooth road ahead...

144
00:13:03,872 --> 00:13:06,721
Just... We just ate the
noodles, that's all.

145
00:13:06,722 --> 00:13:08,571
Stop reading into it for no reason.

146
00:13:08,572 --> 00:13:10,991
I don't think it was just that.

147
00:13:10,992 --> 00:13:13,781
The materials that we asked
for but got ignored about.

148
00:13:13,782 --> 00:13:18,272
Over a bowl of soup and rice...
everything came pouring in.

149
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:23,811
The Goong Foundations current
fund isn't so great.

150
00:13:23,812 --> 00:13:27,991
Who cares if other people's money keeps coming
in? It's not like we can use any of it.

151
00:13:27,992 --> 00:13:33,281
Goong Rak Foundation's money line is Goong
Rak Won. But since it's starving itself...

152
00:13:33,282 --> 00:13:35,311
there's no way.

153
00:13:35,312 --> 00:13:37,321
Wait a little bit more.

154
00:13:37,322 --> 00:13:40,691
Once I get back the management
rights, I'll assist once again.

155
00:13:40,692 --> 00:13:43,121
It will be hard to stand three months.

156
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:46,882
That's enough. It's already in the works.

157
00:13:47,802 --> 00:13:49,821
So fascinating.

158
00:13:49,822 --> 00:13:55,412
There's not even a safe. Where would
all that money be stored away?

159
00:13:56,742 --> 00:14:01,532
Never mind yourself with it. You
do your work right, CEO Lee.

160
00:14:02,432 --> 00:14:08,811
Wow... I work like an ox. I'm
disappointed if you say that.

161
00:14:08,812 --> 00:14:11,372
My tears are coming out.

162
00:14:12,932 --> 00:14:16,861
Bring in Park Tae Ha.
I've done this much...

163
00:14:16,862 --> 00:14:20,912
If you can't bring him in, aren't
you the one with a problem?

164
00:14:23,992 --> 00:14:26,732
<i>Daebak Money, Loan</i>

165
00:14:39,552 --> 00:14:41,102
What the?

166
00:14:43,732 --> 00:14:45,672
Hey...

167
00:14:46,972 --> 00:14:48,501
It's unbelievable.

168
00:14:48,502 --> 00:14:51,651
Did you guys promise to have
an orphanage reunion here?

169
00:14:51,652 --> 00:14:54,341
What about Doggoo?-He...

170
00:14:54,342 --> 00:14:56,821
Doggoo?!

171
00:14:56,822 --> 00:15:00,771
Hey, do you know how many more bowls of rice he's had than you
(meaning older). Don't disrespectfully call him "Doggoo."

172
00:15:00,772 --> 00:15:03,911
Who do you think Doggoo is!

173
00:15:03,912 --> 00:15:05,861
You go there too?

174
00:15:05,862 --> 00:15:10,271
I'm a VVip there! Haven't
you seen in dramas?

175
00:15:10,272 --> 00:15:12,951
Tell him to come see me.

176
00:15:12,952 --> 00:15:15,581
Look at the way he's talking.

177
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:18,232
Who are you to tell me to tell him that?

178
00:15:19,272 --> 00:15:24,411
Hey, do I still look
like a pushover to you?

179
00:15:24,412 --> 00:15:26,441
Don't be like this.

180
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:30,321
You'll never be my match until
the day you die, Cheol Doo.

181
00:15:30,322 --> 00:15:33,052
It's Doo Cheol, I said!

182
00:15:34,872 --> 00:15:37,082
Who the hell are you guys?! Huh?!!!

183
00:15:38,722 --> 00:15:40,261
Senior Patrol Officer Kim...

184
00:15:40,262 --> 00:15:42,701
I'm a sergeant now, Cheol Doo.

185
00:15:42,702 --> 00:15:45,441
I'm from the Supreme Prosecutor's
Office, Special Investigative Team.

186
00:15:45,442 --> 00:15:47,451
Fraud and breaking the moneylending law...

187
00:15:47,452 --> 00:15:51,222
For the charges of forging official documents,
we'll conduct a search and seizure. Begin.

188
00:15:52,602 --> 00:15:55,701
- Stop.- Hey.

189
00:15:55,702 --> 00:15:58,221
You guys stay here.

190
00:15:58,222 --> 00:16:00,812
We'll arraign you as reference witnesses.

191
00:16:06,912 --> 00:16:09,011
Tae Ha?

192
00:16:09,012 --> 00:16:11,531
Oh, my goodness...

193
00:16:11,532 --> 00:16:13,771
Are you really Tae Ha?

194
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:16,332
Why are you here?

195
00:16:17,572 --> 00:16:19,721
It's nothing to with me.

196
00:16:19,722 --> 00:16:22,362
I will be leaving first.

197
00:16:32,102 --> 00:16:33,902
Tae Ha.

198
00:16:35,432 --> 00:16:38,581
[<i>Prosecution</i>]

199
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:41,472
[<i>Prosecutor Chae Yeo Kyeong</i>]

200
00:17:04,082 --> 00:17:07,431
Sorry. You waited a long time, didn't you?

201
00:17:07,432 --> 00:17:09,451
Do you want coffee?

202
00:17:09,452 --> 00:17:11,122
No, I'm fine.

203
00:17:20,512 --> 00:17:23,652
I called you here because
you were at the scene.

204
00:17:24,952 --> 00:17:31,282
Not as Prosecutor Chae Yeo Gyeong, but
right now as your friend Yeo Gyeong.

205
00:17:33,232 --> 00:17:35,532
You didn't change at all.

206
00:17:37,252 --> 00:17:39,092
You look nice.

207
00:17:45,222 --> 00:17:48,761
How... have you been?

208
00:17:48,762 --> 00:17:50,552
Just here and there.

209
00:17:51,702 --> 00:17:56,222
I'm living well using
what I learned in there.

210
00:17:57,002 --> 00:18:01,862
Work is fun, and I think
I'm finding my place.

211
00:18:03,102 --> 00:18:06,691
I want to save money and
purchase a heavy equipment.

212
00:18:06,692 --> 00:18:12,622
I won't live in lap of luxury, but
I won't let my family suffer.

213
00:18:16,252 --> 00:18:19,571
- Tae Ha.- Don't be sorry.

214
00:18:19,572 --> 00:18:24,482
If you say that, the past six
years become meaningless.

215
00:18:26,032 --> 00:18:31,702
Don't say "Thank you" either as it was
for myself, but not because of you.

216
00:18:33,242 --> 00:18:35,082
Don't cry either.

217
00:18:36,412 --> 00:18:42,992
I've grit my teeth and endured until now

218
00:18:45,562 --> 00:18:49,162
Case number 1994-Gohap-5021..

219
00:18:51,612 --> 00:18:53,841
Let's stop it.

220
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:56,851
I think I wasn't thinking well.

221
00:18:56,852 --> 00:19:00,261
Investigating past incidents
won't change anything.

222
00:19:00,262 --> 00:19:05,481
My father killed your parents.

223
00:19:05,482 --> 00:19:08,412
And I was just paying that debt to you.

224
00:19:09,402 --> 00:19:13,101
We're a tragedy that can't be avoided.

225
00:19:13,102 --> 00:19:16,742
Let's stop here, Yeo Gyeong.

226
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,511
From now on, I am
Prosecutor Chae Yeo Kyeong.

227
00:19:24,512 --> 00:19:28,891
I am not your friend anymore,
so listen to my words closely.

228
00:19:28,892 --> 00:19:33,941
If someone orders someone else to kill
a person, that's abetting a murder.

229
00:19:33,942 --> 00:19:38,511
Even if the statute of limitation has expired,
it can't be ignored as if it didn't happen.

230
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:40,592
Changes?

231
00:19:41,262 --> 00:19:43,111
There is.

232
00:19:43,112 --> 00:19:44,902
That person...

233
00:19:46,572 --> 00:19:52,092
who made our lives like this. <i>That person,</i>

234
00:19:54,022 --> 00:20:00,851
Even if we can't send him to jail, we
reveal to the world his real face.

235
00:20:00,852 --> 00:20:03,801
I'm going to completely destroy him.

236
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:07,842
But if we stop now, your
six years and my six years

237
00:20:08,662 --> 00:20:10,922
Everything will become meaningless.

238
00:20:12,702 --> 00:20:14,552
That...

239
00:20:15,452 --> 00:20:17,951
I will never meet him.

240
00:20:17,952 --> 00:20:19,381
Yeo Gyeong.

241
00:20:19,382 --> 00:20:25,111
Doggoo and Good Rak Won's Noodle Master Han Jung
Tae had something to do with that incident.

242
00:20:25,112 --> 00:20:28,742
I'm going to investigate that side first.
Once I get high enough,

243
00:20:29,412 --> 00:20:32,372
I'll run into that bastard someday.

244
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:35,452
Do you not know what I'm saying to you?

245
00:20:35,972 --> 00:20:37,981
It's dangerous and that you would get hurt!

246
00:20:37,982 --> 00:20:40,072
Are you scared of that?

247
00:20:43,092 --> 00:20:45,062
I am not scared.

248
00:20:48,662 --> 00:20:54,742
From now on, "sorry" and "thank you"

249
00:20:55,582 --> 00:20:57,431
will not be said.

250
00:20:57,432 --> 00:21:00,091
Also, I will not show up in front of you.

251
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,212
Also, next time,

252
00:21:03,882 --> 00:21:06,332
don't ask me to stop.

253
00:21:08,702 --> 00:21:13,192
Park Tae Ha that I know,
he never runs away.

254
00:21:13,632 --> 00:21:17,122
He fights all the way for
what he believes is right.

255
00:21:19,972 --> 00:21:22,082
That's you.

256
00:21:28,462 --> 00:21:31,552
I'm finished interviewing
the reference witness.

257
00:21:32,462 --> 00:21:34,972
You can return now.

258
00:21:51,622 --> 00:21:53,322
There's so much more...

259
00:21:55,222 --> 00:21:58,091
Look at you working hard.

260
00:21:58,092 --> 00:22:01,461
My heart breaks everytime I see you.

261
00:22:01,462 --> 00:22:04,461
How much more would it cost
to hire another dishwasher?

262
00:22:04,462 --> 00:22:06,491
They're just killing you.

263
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,211
Isn't something a bit weird?

264
00:22:08,212 --> 00:22:10,601
What do you mean "weird"?

265
00:22:10,602 --> 00:22:14,781
Look over there. A parachute
falls from the sky...

266
00:22:14,782 --> 00:22:16,621
I'm talking about the soup.

267
00:22:16,622 --> 00:22:18,931
There's a lot of soup left nowadays.

268
00:22:18,932 --> 00:22:21,441
Especially the palace
pheasant buckwheat noodles.

269
00:22:21,442 --> 00:22:25,951
Really? I'm busy making side dishes.
How would I know?

270
00:22:25,952 --> 00:22:29,951
There's often more than half of the soup left.
Some customers even just eat the noodles.

271
00:22:29,952 --> 00:22:33,721
Hong Chun Yeo! Hurry up and get over here!
Aren't you going to get ready for early lunch?

272
00:22:33,722 --> 00:22:37,791
I got you, so stop calling me!
Always calling me,

273
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:39,921
My name will get worn down.

274
00:22:39,922 --> 00:22:41,722
Noona Da Hae!

275
00:22:42,692 --> 00:22:44,221
Has our Gil Yong come?

276
00:22:44,222 --> 00:22:46,322
I did!

277
00:22:48,462 --> 00:22:49,641
Why don't you greet me?

278
00:22:49,642 --> 00:22:51,341
-It was good not seeing you.-Eesh.

279
00:22:51,342 --> 00:22:53,681
You two, follow me.

280
00:22:53,682 --> 00:22:55,312
Quickly!

281
00:22:58,022 --> 00:23:00,451
You're in for a real treat.

282
00:23:00,452 --> 00:23:05,332
Look, this is Hwayangjeong
the king used to eat.

283
00:23:09,242 --> 00:23:11,951
Wow, this is so good. So delicious!

284
00:23:11,952 --> 00:23:13,651
Ah, right?

285
00:23:13,652 --> 00:23:15,681
Our Da Hae needs one too.

286
00:23:15,682 --> 00:23:20,662
Then, for you to get prettier...
here's Chongpomukjeon.

287
00:23:23,422 --> 00:23:25,331
Isn't it good?

288
00:23:25,332 --> 00:23:27,182
We should eat more.

289
00:23:29,862 --> 00:23:34,651
Has it been about 3 years since
you wandered about here?

290
00:23:34,652 --> 00:23:37,471
What do you mean wander about?
I'm not a rat.

291
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,731
I confidently deliver vegetables.

292
00:23:39,732 --> 00:23:41,872
You haven't been coming recently.

293
00:23:42,412 --> 00:23:45,142
Well... I've other things
going on, that's why.

294
00:23:45,892 --> 00:23:46,892
Did you miss me?

295
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:48,732
I should just!

296
00:23:55,802 --> 00:23:56,881
Who are you?

297
00:23:56,882 --> 00:23:58,831
I'm the vegetable deliverer, Go Gu Ra.

298
00:23:58,832 --> 00:24:02,102
I mean, Go Gil Yong.

299
00:24:03,522 --> 00:24:06,282
See me, Hong Chun Yeo.

300
00:24:15,722 --> 00:24:21,961
Madam, I didn't invite him
in on purpose... well...

301
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:24,271
You use the same room as Kim Da Hae, right?

302
00:24:24,272 --> 00:24:25,742
Pardon?

303
00:24:27,482 --> 00:24:29,031
Oh, of course.

304
00:24:29,032 --> 00:24:32,921
That girl always snores so much.

305
00:24:32,922 --> 00:24:37,901
From now, tell me
everything Kim Da Hae does.

306
00:24:37,902 --> 00:24:39,291
What's the reason?

307
00:24:39,292 --> 00:24:42,231
Don't ask, just do as I tell you.

308
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:46,241
This is a secret between just you and me.

309
00:24:46,242 --> 00:24:48,041
You understand?

310
00:24:48,042 --> 00:24:50,762
Yes, I understand.

311
00:25:04,282 --> 00:25:06,142
Potager.

312
00:25:07,382 --> 00:25:10,181
- What?- Can I taste the broth?

313
00:25:10,182 --> 00:25:13,231
Why? To cure your hangover?

314
00:25:13,232 --> 00:25:15,152
Did you drink?

315
00:25:28,672 --> 00:25:30,792
What are you doing?

316
00:25:33,402 --> 00:25:35,051
You said not to act like I know you.

317
00:25:35,052 --> 00:25:37,692
Except for when talking
about work-related things.

318
00:25:41,712 --> 00:25:45,111
The after-taste as subtly bitter.

319
00:25:45,112 --> 00:25:47,851
This is why the customers haven't
been finishing the soup.

320
00:25:47,852 --> 00:25:49,451
You knew too?

321
00:25:49,452 --> 00:25:53,551
For noodles houses or soup specialty restaurants...
it's essential to check on the broth.

322
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,272
If you just pay attention
a little, you can tell.

323
00:25:59,872 --> 00:26:02,501
There's no problem with the other broths.

324
00:26:02,502 --> 00:26:05,132
The palace pheasant buckwheat
noodles indeed has the problem.

325
00:26:07,412 --> 00:26:08,431
What should we do now?

326
00:26:08,432 --> 00:26:11,392
Since we know the problem,
we should solve it.

327
00:26:15,802 --> 00:26:20,351
You said that if I don't touch nor hurt your
belongings, you said you wouldn't touch mine.

328
00:26:20,352 --> 00:26:22,651
Is Goong Rak Won included in that?

329
00:26:22,652 --> 00:26:25,381
It's not yours yet.

330
00:26:25,382 --> 00:26:28,151
Your ability to learn
quickly is still slow.

331
00:26:28,152 --> 00:26:31,411
After being threatened by
you, I thought long and hard.

332
00:26:31,412 --> 00:26:36,971
Should I give up now or see how it unfolds?

333
00:26:36,972 --> 00:26:40,372
Guess what I decided on?

334
00:26:43,272 --> 00:26:45,361
Whatever your decision,

335
00:26:45,362 --> 00:26:49,112
You can't protect Goong Rak Won.

336
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,121
Look at you.

337
00:26:52,122 --> 00:26:55,691
You looked down on me your whole life.

338
00:26:55,692 --> 00:27:00,302
Goong Rak Won became like this
because of your sabotage.

339
00:27:02,582 --> 00:27:05,951
- Sabotage?-Giving up
operation of Goong Rak Won

340
00:27:05,952 --> 00:27:09,221
doesn't include giving up
the role of Noodle Master.

341
00:27:09,222 --> 00:27:13,511
Nowadays, you act like you've
let go of Goong Rak Won

342
00:27:13,512 --> 00:27:15,871
and offering it up to its demise.

343
00:27:15,872 --> 00:27:19,171
It is sabotage.

344
00:27:19,172 --> 00:27:20,962
Listen closely.

345
00:27:21,602 --> 00:27:27,171
The reason why it's in this state is
because you don't have the ability.

346
00:27:27,172 --> 00:27:31,512
Before you blame others,
take a look at yourself.

347
00:27:32,342 --> 00:27:36,021
If you don't have the skills,
hand over the operating rights.

348
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:37,461
Don't blame on the innocent person.

349
00:27:37,462 --> 00:27:41,221
You want me to wave flag
and give up, right?

350
00:27:41,222 --> 00:27:43,171
Wake up from your dream.

351
00:27:43,172 --> 00:27:46,891
I'm going to fill up the remaining
three months and endure.

352
00:27:46,892 --> 00:27:52,091
If you throw in the towel now, I'll
let you be in charge of the kitchen.

353
00:27:52,092 --> 00:27:54,121
But if you don't give up,

354
00:27:54,122 --> 00:27:58,462
there will be nothing left
in your hands after 3 weeks.

355
00:27:58,992 --> 00:28:00,431
Remember.

356
00:28:00,432 --> 00:28:02,142
Kim Da Hae!

357
00:28:10,552 --> 00:28:12,492
Why are you so surprised?

358
00:28:14,232 --> 00:28:16,551
Look at you widening your eyes.

359
00:28:16,552 --> 00:28:20,892
Say what you want to say, instead
of beating around the bush.

360
00:28:22,432 --> 00:28:25,571
Isn't it time to promote her?

361
00:28:25,572 --> 00:28:28,831
She works hard and has talent.

362
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:33,021
I do feel a bit uneasy about her
being Madam Seol's connection, but

363
00:28:33,022 --> 00:28:35,701
I know you're interested in her.

364
00:28:35,702 --> 00:28:37,321
Isn't that right?

365
00:28:37,322 --> 00:28:39,361
It's too early right now.

366
00:28:39,362 --> 00:28:41,571
Think about it.

367
00:28:41,572 --> 00:28:44,141
I've decided already.

368
00:28:44,142 --> 00:28:47,411
If Madam Seol agrees, I can promote her.

369
00:28:47,412 --> 00:28:53,032
If we're going to promote her, wouldn't it
look good to all agree on this decision?

370
00:29:09,012 --> 00:29:10,921
I think it's fine.

371
00:29:10,922 --> 00:29:15,122
The palace pheasant buckwheat noodles... you use
the pheasant sauce along with fish and meat sauce.

372
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:19,691
These guys are playing hookie
whenever you get a chance.

373
00:29:19,692 --> 00:29:21,542
Hey, Laborer.

374
00:29:22,312 --> 00:29:23,361
Yes!

375
00:29:23,362 --> 00:29:25,761
Can a laborer touch the jars or not?

376
00:29:25,762 --> 00:29:26,781
I'm not allowed to touch them.

377
00:29:26,782 --> 00:29:30,371
What Goong Rak Won is most
careful about is sauce thieves.

378
00:29:30,372 --> 00:29:33,501
Half of our recipe lies in these sauces.

379
00:29:33,502 --> 00:29:36,301
If you don't want to be mislabeled as a
thief, don't even lay a finger on these.

380
00:29:36,302 --> 00:29:38,532
- Understand?- Yes.

381
00:29:38,942 --> 00:29:41,581
And you, kiddo...

382
00:29:41,582 --> 00:29:44,362
Hey, where is fish and meat sauce?

383
00:29:46,192 --> 00:29:48,001
Where is it?<i>-Are you ignoring me
(literally chewing my words)?</i>

384
00:29:48,002 --> 00:29:50,922
- In the storage. We keep
them separate.<i>-Am I gum?</i>

385
00:29:51,982 --> 00:29:54,021
Hey! Aren't you going to stop there?

386
00:29:54,022 --> 00:29:55,601
Stop while I'm saying it nicely.

387
00:29:55,602 --> 00:29:58,932
One, two, three.

388
00:30:01,672 --> 00:30:05,251
The Noodle Master takes special care of the fish
and meat sauce storage. No one else can go in.

389
00:30:05,252 --> 00:30:08,582
Even the potager receives
necessary daily allowance.

390
00:30:17,462 --> 00:30:20,442
You're treating your
senior way too easily...

391
00:30:21,142 --> 00:30:22,522
<i>What?</i>

392
00:30:30,192 --> 00:30:33,851
Hey, hey, hey... This isn't right...

393
00:30:33,852 --> 00:30:35,552
<i>Please stop!</i>

394
00:31:01,702 --> 00:31:03,292
Stay back.

395
00:31:07,882 --> 00:31:09,491
<i>Crazy bastard!</i>

396
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:10,651
What are you doing right now?!

397
00:31:10,652 --> 00:31:12,291
This is a deadly sauce.

398
00:31:12,292 --> 00:31:15,292
It's something human shouldn't be eating.

399
00:31:16,092 --> 00:31:18,352
Can't you stop?!

400
00:31:20,452 --> 00:31:22,391
<i>Stop.</i>

401
00:31:22,392 --> 00:31:25,031
You saw it too, Noodle Master.

402
00:31:25,032 --> 00:31:28,251
He's destroying all these
precious stone pots.

403
00:31:28,252 --> 00:31:29,811
Step away.

404
00:31:29,812 --> 00:31:31,641
Noodle Master!

405
00:31:31,642 --> 00:31:33,382
Quick!

406
00:31:42,492 --> 00:31:46,521
For noodles, a stone pot is its life.

407
00:31:46,522 --> 00:31:49,561
No matter how well the dough was made,

408
00:31:49,562 --> 00:31:52,061
if the sauce tastes bad, you
can't make tasty noodles.

409
00:31:52,062 --> 00:31:56,031
Right now now, the ten year
old fish and meat sauce...

410
00:31:56,032 --> 00:31:59,011
and the ceramic jars made out of special soil
from Mount Taebaek... you destroyed them all.

411
00:31:59,012 --> 00:32:02,361
Convince me why you had to destroy them.

412
00:32:02,362 --> 00:32:06,521
If you can't convince me,
you'll have to pay for it.

413
00:32:06,522 --> 00:32:09,592
This ceramic jar isn't made
out of the special soil.

414
00:32:10,192 --> 00:32:13,791
Instead of using red lead glaze, they
used traditional glaze to fool you.

415
00:32:13,792 --> 00:32:17,361
Because the jar isn't made out of the
special soil, the jar can't breathe.

416
00:32:17,362 --> 00:32:22,541
Since the sauce can't breathe and is trapped inside the jar, it has
changed to bitter and sour taste rather than its intense taste.

417
00:32:22,542 --> 00:32:26,531
This is the reason why the
customers leave left overs.

418
00:32:26,532 --> 00:32:28,361
Fish and meat sauce taste changed?

419
00:32:28,362 --> 00:32:29,491
Yes!

420
00:32:29,492 --> 00:32:31,322
Check then.

421
00:32:43,592 --> 00:32:46,852
Taste it right now.

422
00:32:54,802 --> 00:32:57,081
He's right.

423
00:32:57,082 --> 00:32:59,571
It's bitter and sour.

424
00:32:59,572 --> 00:33:03,491
Polishing the outer surface and letting it
receive sunlight doesn't do everything.

425
00:33:03,492 --> 00:33:07,492
That's why I broke them.
So they can breathe.

426
00:33:08,372 --> 00:33:12,531
Check the rest of the fish
and meat sauce thoroughly.

427
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:16,211
Pay special attention to taking
care of the ceramic jars.

428
00:33:16,212 --> 00:33:18,442
Yes, I understand.

429
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:26,761
Da Hae,

430
00:33:26,762 --> 00:33:28,111
you knew it too?

431
00:33:28,112 --> 00:33:32,352
I thought it was strange as
there were so many left overs.

432
00:33:33,282 --> 00:33:35,352
I didn't know.

433
00:33:37,162 --> 00:33:38,931
What an embarrassment.

434
00:33:38,932 --> 00:33:40,531
I'm sorry.

435
00:33:40,532 --> 00:33:42,531
Why should you be sorry?

436
00:33:42,532 --> 00:33:44,361
It was my fault for not paying attention.

437
00:33:44,362 --> 00:33:46,331
It's not your fault.

438
00:33:46,332 --> 00:33:50,591
The Noodle Master switched all the ceramic jars
for the fish and meat sauce two months ago.

439
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:54,611
You opposed that. This is the
jar that was switched then.

440
00:33:54,612 --> 00:33:59,311
The thing you just said,
don't say it anyone else.

441
00:33:59,312 --> 00:34:03,302
If that leaks out, we're finished.

442
00:34:11,432 --> 00:34:15,122
He knew I changed the ceramic jars.

443
00:34:15,732 --> 00:34:19,062
Just by looking at the texture and shine.

444
00:34:22,862 --> 00:34:27,172
What is with this cold atmosphere today?

445
00:34:28,362 --> 00:34:30,142
What's the matter?

446
00:34:31,372 --> 00:34:33,061
The election is over now.

447
00:34:33,062 --> 00:34:36,791
National Election Committee started
investigating violations in election laws.

448
00:34:36,792 --> 00:34:42,632
Many will get tangled and head for jail. You
should prepare for the Special Election.

449
00:34:46,562 --> 00:34:50,911
If we let this chance go, then we
will have to wait four more years.

450
00:34:50,912 --> 00:34:55,221
I'm okay, but I'm not sure if you are okay.

451
00:34:55,222 --> 00:34:59,211
I have to get Goong Rak Won back.
That's my priority.

452
00:34:59,212 --> 00:35:03,351
That's right. Ha Jung Tae, the
man, is no use for the election.

453
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:07,581
But it's different for the Noodle
Master Ha Jung Tae of Goong Rak Won.

454
00:35:07,582 --> 00:35:10,541
You must hold on to the
Noodle Master position.

455
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:13,312
Everything will be over
the minute you let go.

456
00:35:16,792 --> 00:35:18,832
Tell me your plan.

457
00:35:20,762 --> 00:35:28,121
Deciding on districts, staff, campaign office,
campaigners, working the ground... it's all useless.

458
00:35:28,122 --> 00:35:30,181
You just need to received the nomination.

459
00:35:30,182 --> 00:35:35,601
With the nomination, you'll receive money.
Then people will gather. So...

460
00:35:35,602 --> 00:35:38,172
you can put on a gold badge, right?

461
00:35:38,862 --> 00:35:44,991
That badge... it only weighs 6 grams
and is plated gold only worth $35.

462
00:35:44,992 --> 00:35:51,122
But the minute you put that on, you'll be treated like a
Minister and become an independent constitutional institution.

463
00:35:54,942 --> 00:35:57,491
You can't give up.

464
00:35:57,492 --> 00:36:00,191
Anyhow, this might be the last chance.

465
00:36:00,192 --> 00:36:03,072
How can you be so easy?

466
00:36:07,682 --> 00:36:09,621
Ma'am.

467
00:36:09,622 --> 00:36:12,421
I couldn't bare to see
you two from blushing.

468
00:36:12,422 --> 00:36:15,111
Wow, you were coming on strong.

469
00:36:15,112 --> 00:36:19,121
It's the job of a PR Director.
Straightening out his clothes.

470
00:36:19,122 --> 00:36:21,701
PR Director?

471
00:36:21,702 --> 00:36:26,511
Wow, she moved up fast. How many times
did you do PR to get the director title?

472
00:36:26,512 --> 00:36:31,091
I receive corporate director position
proposal from time to time. It's no big deal.

473
00:36:31,092 --> 00:36:33,781
If you received a proposal,
you would've gone there.

474
00:36:33,782 --> 00:36:38,472
No matter how big Goong Rak Won may be, it wouldn't
compare with a big corporation. Don't you think?

475
00:36:40,522 --> 00:36:43,321
You're about 165 cm?

476
00:36:43,322 --> 00:36:47,822
Pale skin, medium hair length.

477
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:53,692
I see both a lady and seductress
in your face. Totally his style.

478
00:36:54,522 --> 00:36:56,261
I feel offended.

479
00:36:56,262 --> 00:36:58,731
Stop.

480
00:36:58,732 --> 00:37:01,541
Should I make you even more offended?

481
00:37:01,542 --> 00:37:06,712
Including you, this is the fourth time.

482
00:37:07,472 --> 00:37:13,752
So, enjoy as much as you can while you have the chance.
You'll get pushed over by number five in an instant.

483
00:37:20,032 --> 00:37:24,521
I know you're tempting him
to get into politics.

484
00:37:24,522 --> 00:37:30,641
I'm warning you. Noodle Master, no,
Good Rak Won... don't shake it up.

485
00:37:30,642 --> 00:37:35,182
If you continue to shake things
up, I won't leave you alone.

486
00:37:36,202 --> 00:37:38,372
Do you understand?

487
00:37:39,602 --> 00:37:43,462
Yeah... is this a gangster or something?

488
00:37:44,572 --> 00:37:46,482
Gangster?

489
00:37:48,072 --> 00:37:50,571
Are you scared of gangsters?

490
00:37:50,572 --> 00:37:54,472
I'm scarier.

491
00:37:58,762 --> 00:38:02,752
Director Do, you can go now.

492
00:38:11,812 --> 00:38:14,701
She has no guts. She's useless.

493
00:38:14,702 --> 00:38:19,261
She's nervously pissing all over the place
at one word out of my mouth. What PR?

494
00:38:19,262 --> 00:38:22,982
Say what you want to say.
Stop your sarcasm.

495
00:38:24,372 --> 00:38:28,231
Politics? Do it if you want to.

496
00:38:28,232 --> 00:38:32,712
You're not someone who'd
listen to me if I said no.

497
00:38:35,072 --> 00:38:39,172
I don't care as long as
Goong Rak Won runs well.

498
00:38:39,782 --> 00:38:42,091
But

499
00:38:42,092 --> 00:38:45,671
don't think about coming
back after you fail.

500
00:38:45,672 --> 00:38:47,992
I won't accept that.

501
00:38:48,792 --> 00:38:51,601
Look at you curse me.

502
00:38:51,602 --> 00:38:56,051
The best thing is for you to make noodles.
The worst is to get into politics.

503
00:38:56,052 --> 00:38:59,661
There's no in between. Choose one.

504
00:38:59,662 --> 00:39:03,311
You can't imagine having both?

505
00:39:03,312 --> 00:39:06,242
Let's live positively.

506
00:39:08,462 --> 00:39:13,761
Even when I see my husband playing
with another woman, I'm still smiling.

507
00:39:13,762 --> 00:39:17,222
How much more positive do I have to be?

508
00:39:28,672 --> 00:39:31,222
That's killer!

509
00:39:32,432 --> 00:39:34,431
Congratulations on your third election win.

510
00:39:34,432 --> 00:39:37,552
This is all thanks to you, Noodle Master.

511
00:39:39,452 --> 00:39:42,881
You have to support me now.

512
00:39:42,882 --> 00:39:44,581
My heart is all in, but...

513
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:49,481
I don't know how to support you so that
people would say I supported you well.

514
00:39:49,482 --> 00:39:51,401
Do you know, Noodle Master?

515
00:39:51,402 --> 00:39:55,762
Right around your sixth election win,
would you be able to support me easily?

516
00:39:56,612 --> 00:40:01,282
You realize that the only senator who's been
elected six times is Senator So Tae Seop, right?

517
00:40:02,132 --> 00:40:07,081
What do I need to do to meet the very
important six times elected senator?

518
00:40:07,082 --> 00:40:10,792
They say the beacon does not shine
on its own base. It's really true.

519
00:40:11,922 --> 00:40:14,081
Wasn't it Moo Myeong?

520
00:40:14,082 --> 00:40:18,642
He's much closer to him than I am.

521
00:40:23,582 --> 00:40:26,272
So pretty.

522
00:40:27,372 --> 00:40:31,461
How could noodles be this immaculate?

523
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:33,681
It's called Yeonah noodles.

524
00:40:33,682 --> 00:40:35,971
I added lotus extract in
the flour to knead it.

525
00:40:35,972 --> 00:40:39,181
The broth is made out
of mushrooms and dashi.

526
00:40:39,182 --> 00:40:42,991
You can say it's one of the best of the
monk noodles that you like so much.

527
00:40:42,992 --> 00:40:47,161
They call it monk noodles because
it makes the monks smile, right?

528
00:40:47,162 --> 00:40:48,311
Yes.

529
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:52,061
It's my good fortune that I met you.

530
00:40:52,062 --> 00:40:57,332
If you hadn't come to the temple to
rest, how could I have ever met you?

531
00:40:58,342 --> 00:41:01,991
I went to the temple to pay my respects

532
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:04,802
and I met the noodle buddha.

533
00:41:07,052 --> 00:41:08,692
Have some.

534
00:41:35,642 --> 00:41:37,871
How's your body?

535
00:41:37,872 --> 00:41:40,332
Yes, I'm all better now.

536
00:41:41,182 --> 00:41:44,692
I feel bad asking you to
make noodles all the time.

537
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,321
Just tell me.

538
00:41:48,322 --> 00:41:51,992
I'll set up a nice noodle
restaurant for you.

539
00:41:52,772 --> 00:41:54,521
You're a bit late.

540
00:41:54,522 --> 00:41:57,662
I got into Goong Rak Won.

541
00:41:58,622 --> 00:42:00,202
What?

542
00:42:01,422 --> 00:42:06,711
Why would you work for someone else when
your skills aren't lacking anything?

543
00:42:06,712 --> 00:42:10,822
I have always respected the
Goong Rak Won Noodle Master.

544
00:42:15,622 --> 00:42:19,231
I would feel even worse
calling you up in the future.

545
00:42:19,232 --> 00:42:24,382
Don't worry, if you call
me, I'll come anytime.

546
00:42:50,092 --> 00:42:51,722
Ma'am.

547
00:42:53,522 --> 00:42:56,141
Father just fell asleep.

548
00:42:56,142 --> 00:42:57,931
You don't need to go in.

549
00:42:57,932 --> 00:42:59,581
But still, since I'm here already,
I want to see his face...

550
00:42:59,582 --> 00:43:03,592
From now... You don't need to come here.

551
00:43:06,232 --> 00:43:10,002
You... I'll promote you as a noodle maker.

552
00:43:10,602 --> 00:43:11,721
A noodle maker?

553
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:14,111
You'll get busier.

554
00:43:14,112 --> 00:43:17,951
I feel bad being selfish.

555
00:43:17,952 --> 00:43:21,131
I'm okay, I come here as I like it.

556
00:43:21,132 --> 00:43:23,151
For now, focus on work.

557
00:43:23,152 --> 00:43:29,482
Now that I've made you a noodle maker, if you fail and get
back to working as a laborer, we'd both be embarrassed.

558
00:43:31,282 --> 00:43:35,812
I'll call you to the separate living quarters
when I need you again. Let's do that, okay?

559
00:44:15,702 --> 00:44:18,831
Hey! Tae Ha! Are you alright?

560
00:44:18,832 --> 00:44:21,481
Ugh! Why did they take an innocent person?

561
00:44:21,482 --> 00:44:25,261
What a hassle. They come and turn things upside
down whenever they want to. These jerks.

562
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:28,851
Hey, we're not illegal.

563
00:44:28,852 --> 00:44:32,281
We're doing legal business.

564
00:44:32,282 --> 00:44:34,142
Do you remember Myeong?

565
00:44:36,462 --> 00:44:39,602
The one who came to the junkyard fight?

566
00:44:40,382 --> 00:44:41,772
Myeong?

567
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:46,282
Myeong... Oh, that guy? The
one who took you away?

568
00:44:47,172 --> 00:44:50,202
Ignore him even if you run
into him at Goong Rak Won.

569
00:44:50,872 --> 00:44:54,101
Also, tell Doo Cheol that when he sees
him, don't act like he knows him.

570
00:44:54,102 --> 00:44:56,132
Why should I do that?

571
00:44:56,732 --> 00:45:00,592
Shouldn't the one who has to
poop look for an outhouse?

572
00:45:01,152 --> 00:45:04,431
Myeong has evil connection
with the Noodle Master.

573
00:45:04,432 --> 00:45:07,042
His identity can't be revealed.
He'll be in danger.

574
00:45:08,332 --> 00:45:10,981
If you're that worried, you go
in yourself and protect him.

575
00:45:10,982 --> 00:45:14,191
How can you take yourself out of it
and tell someone else to do that?

576
00:45:14,192 --> 00:45:17,562
I don't know. You take care of it yourself.

577
00:45:19,032 --> 00:45:21,122
I'll go in!

578
00:45:24,062 --> 00:45:25,831
I'll go to Goong Rak Won.

579
00:45:25,832 --> 00:45:28,792
But instead, keep it a
secret, you and Doo cheol.

580
00:45:30,852 --> 00:45:34,712
Instead, I've a favor to ask of you too.

581
00:45:39,422 --> 00:45:41,631
She's like my daughter,

582
00:45:41,632 --> 00:45:43,531
so take care of her well.

583
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:46,401
If it seems dangerous, you've to block it.
Can you do that?

584
00:45:46,402 --> 00:45:49,401
She's like a daughter,
then why is she here?

585
00:45:49,402 --> 00:45:52,732
Ugh, this punk. You're
digging into my wound.

586
00:45:53,432 --> 00:45:55,792
Oh, kiddo!

587
00:46:12,112 --> 00:46:14,421
We'll open soon. I have to go soon.

588
00:46:14,422 --> 00:46:16,832
Stop pretending to be so strong.

589
00:46:17,622 --> 00:46:21,182
Park Tae Ha. Kim Da Hae. Greet each other.

590
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:24,402
Hello?

591
00:46:25,052 --> 00:46:26,191
Yes!

592
00:46:26,192 --> 00:46:30,851
He will be working in there
too, so be nice to each other.

593
00:46:30,852 --> 00:46:32,411
I brought him to greet you.

594
00:46:32,412 --> 00:46:34,752
Since I greeted already, that's it right?

595
00:46:39,892 --> 00:46:43,882
She has a bit of a temper.

596
00:46:44,712 --> 00:46:46,561
I know!

597
00:46:46,562 --> 00:46:48,072
You know?

598
00:46:50,172 --> 00:46:52,022
Yes.-How though?

599
00:47:05,032 --> 00:47:07,432
I didn't put any lipstick either.

600
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:27,352
Sun glass! It's well?

601
00:47:29,602 --> 00:47:32,162
The one that I gave you.

602
00:47:33,272 --> 00:47:35,211
It should be well.

603
00:47:35,212 --> 00:47:37,382
It's been a while.

604
00:47:38,252 --> 00:47:40,182
Yes, it's been a while.

605
00:48:08,522 --> 00:48:10,342
Come in.

606
00:48:14,762 --> 00:48:16,411
Noodle Master.

607
00:48:16,412 --> 00:48:17,942
Have a seat.

608
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:28,061
The fish and meat sauce incident...
We were able to avoid the worst.

609
00:48:28,062 --> 00:48:30,021
I wanted to thank you.

610
00:48:30,022 --> 00:48:31,881
It's no big deal.

611
00:48:31,882 --> 00:48:37,271
Anyway... you must have a huge network.

612
00:48:37,272 --> 00:48:39,492
What do you mean?

613
00:48:40,732 --> 00:48:43,851
Your connection with
Congressman Choi and...

614
00:48:43,852 --> 00:48:47,261
I heard you're close to
Senator So Tae Seop...

615
00:48:47,262 --> 00:48:50,251
I met him a few times
at the Buddhist Temple.

616
00:48:50,252 --> 00:48:53,262
He specially likes my noodles.

617
00:48:54,022 --> 00:48:59,821
So Tae Seop... I would like for him to
come in here. Can I ask you this favor?

618
00:48:59,822 --> 00:49:03,111
Yes. Well, it isn't that hard.

619
00:49:03,112 --> 00:49:06,361
Great. Quickly, let's set a date.

620
00:49:06,362 --> 00:49:07,602
Yes.

621
00:49:09,932 --> 00:49:12,632
I've a condition.

622
00:49:13,362 --> 00:49:15,111
Condition?

623
00:49:15,112 --> 00:49:17,801
Promote me into the Noodle chef.

624
00:49:17,802 --> 00:49:24,541
One more thing. I must appear in
all the broadcasts you're in.

625
00:49:24,542 --> 00:49:29,361
If this condition is met, then
I'll bring So Tae Seop in.

626
00:49:29,362 --> 00:49:35,172
That's the same thing as asking
me to raise you as the successor.

627
00:49:35,742 --> 00:49:41,271
Your request is quite extreme in exchange
for a bowl of noodles for the senator.

628
00:49:41,272 --> 00:49:46,552
Your goal isn't to serve him
noodles to begin with, right?

629
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,581
Another goal?

630
00:49:48,582 --> 00:49:51,651
I've already revealed my intentions to you.

631
00:49:51,652 --> 00:49:55,021
It's my goal to be your successor.

632
00:49:55,022 --> 00:50:01,021
If you open up your heart,
I'm ready to do anything.

633
00:50:01,022 --> 00:50:04,112
Whether that be noodles or politics.

634
00:50:08,802 --> 00:50:13,142
If Madam Seol knew this he would pass out.

635
00:50:13,902 --> 00:50:20,401
I'd like to show her the image of
one of her own betraying her..

636
00:50:20,402 --> 00:50:22,801
I'm not anyone's person(side),

637
00:50:22,802 --> 00:50:27,841
I merely met Madam Seol
prior to meeting you.

638
00:50:27,842 --> 00:50:33,361
I'm not switching sides but merely
choosing an owner for the first time.

639
00:50:33,362 --> 00:50:39,421
Myeong, you know that I'm being
suspicious of you, right?

640
00:50:39,422 --> 00:50:44,641
Please be more suspicious of me, then only
after that, you'll start believing me.

641
00:50:44,642 --> 00:50:52,041
If a single word said here today turns out to
be false there will be grave consequences..

642
00:50:52,042 --> 00:50:55,301
Myeong, you can't handle me.

643
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:58,901
I don't do things I can't manage.

644
00:50:58,902 --> 00:51:04,861
The thing I'm best at is scaring people.

645
00:51:04,862 --> 00:51:10,741
Once the person is scared, he starts to be
generous and is easier to negotiate with.

646
00:51:10,742 --> 00:51:15,622
But it doesn't seem to be working on you.

647
00:51:17,442 --> 00:51:19,922
Should I act like I'm scared?

648
00:51:21,982 --> 00:51:28,261
I like your courage. The courage
to make a deal with me.

649
00:51:28,262 --> 00:51:30,642
I'll take that as a compliment.

650
00:51:35,722 --> 00:51:40,241
On promoting you as the Noodle Chef...
let me think about it.

651
00:51:40,242 --> 00:51:41,782
Yes!

652
00:52:31,242 --> 00:52:34,661
Why did you change your
mind all of a sudden?

653
00:52:34,662 --> 00:52:40,881
I was impatient. I thought this
chance would never come again.

654
00:52:40,882 --> 00:52:43,601
That's why I came here.

655
00:52:43,602 --> 00:52:47,681
To come under me, you need
to uphold some rules.

656
00:52:47,682 --> 00:52:53,641
First, don't judge things for yourself.
I'll do the judging.

657
00:52:53,642 --> 00:52:56,561
I order you and you do it.

658
00:52:56,562 --> 00:52:57,562
I understand.

659
00:52:57,563 --> 00:53:03,721
Second betrayal, lying, and other
motives will not be allowed.

660
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:08,081
If something like that happens
then you'll pay the price.

661
00:53:08,082 --> 00:53:09,341
I'll keep that in mind.

662
00:53:09,342 --> 00:53:17,342
Third don't bring your father's
info up until I allow it.

663
00:53:23,062 --> 00:53:31,062
I'll let you know when you prove that
you're my guy, will you till do it?

664
00:53:31,102 --> 00:53:33,341
Yes, I'll.

665
00:53:33,342 --> 00:53:35,202
Follow me.

666
00:53:45,282 --> 00:53:48,321
This person will drive,
you've the license right?

667
00:53:48,322 --> 00:53:49,822
Yes!

668
00:53:56,002 --> 00:54:00,002
I'm going to bring a guest.
Please make the preparations.

669
00:54:32,762 --> 00:54:34,742
Please go inside.

670
00:55:00,542 --> 00:55:04,562
Let's stop now. That's enough.

671
00:55:30,722 --> 00:55:35,082
Clean out Secretary Ha's room.
Someone else is going in.

672
00:55:36,662 --> 00:55:39,082
Were you testing me?

673
00:55:40,282 --> 00:55:43,761
Things that cost a dollar
I'll buying with ease.

674
00:55:43,762 --> 00:55:47,201
Even if it's defective it's
only cost me a dollar.

675
00:55:47,202 --> 00:55:54,501
But starting with something costing $10,
you try to be choosy. $100, $1000...

676
00:55:54,502 --> 00:55:59,642
It's human nature to chose more
carefully when the price is higher.

677
00:56:01,102 --> 00:56:05,902
From now on, I'm going to
invest a lot into you.

678
00:56:07,102 --> 00:56:09,341
It's a given that I test you.

679
00:56:09,342 --> 00:56:11,201
I'm not a product.

680
00:56:11,202 --> 00:56:19,102
You are a product. And you will
become my most expensive product.

681
00:56:27,302 --> 00:56:30,962
You'll look good in suit.

682
00:56:53,822 --> 00:56:56,521
What are you doing?!

683
00:56:56,522 --> 00:57:02,642
Have I not told you the trash needs to be recycled and
clothes go separately. Have I told you this before or not?

684
00:57:03,782 --> 00:57:06,582
Who's stuff is it?-Secretarty Ha.

685
00:57:08,862 --> 00:57:13,221
I'll throw away the trash and
burn the rest so you can go.

686
00:57:13,222 --> 00:57:15,341
This is something I've to do...

687
00:57:15,342 --> 00:57:21,282
If you throw something you weren't supposed to,
are you going to take responsibility? Hurry go!

688
00:57:22,402 --> 00:57:25,301
Just go! Just go.

689
00:57:25,302 --> 00:57:30,982
These people... they don't
have basic civil mentality!

690
00:58:40,202 --> 00:58:44,141
I...feel burdened.

691
00:58:44,142 --> 00:58:46,841
I'm doing this to make you feel burdened.

692
00:58:46,842 --> 00:58:49,782
That way, you'll do your best.

693
00:59:29,562 --> 00:59:35,501
Good work. It's this room. You must be
tired, so from now on, you stay in there.

694
00:59:35,502 --> 00:59:37,422
Yes, sir.
