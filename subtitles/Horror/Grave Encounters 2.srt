00:00:54,497 --> 00:00:56,590
Hey guys, we're on the October 30th DVD update,

2
00:00:56,966 --> 00:00:58,797
and the next film I want to talk about is Grave Encounters.

3
00:00:59,169 --> 00:00:59,601
Grave Encounters.

4
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:00,799
Grave Encounters?

5
00:01:01,171 --> 00:01:03,139
Grave Encounters!

6
00:01:10,213 --> 00:01:12,306
So someone follows a bunch of ghost hunters filming

7
00:01:12,682 --> 00:01:14,479
a new reality TV show, to which leads them

8
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:17,342
to an abandoned mental hospital in the search of the unknown.

9
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,245
Turns out to be a lot more realistic than they had hoped for.

10
00:01:20,657 --> 00:01:21,954
They run into grave encounters.

11
00:01:22,325 --> 00:01:23,622
The effects are well done.

12
00:01:23,993 --> 00:01:25,153
The camera work is terrible.

13
00:01:25,528 --> 00:01:30,693
The only downfall with the film, and,
and it's a big one: not a lot of scares.

14
00:01:31,067 --> 00:01:32,364
It's fuckin' scary!

15
00:01:32,735 --> 00:01:34,726
It's fucking...horrible!

16
00:01:35,138 --> 00:01:37,971
You're watching it, and it just twists with your mind.

17
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:40,138
And there's some pretty freaky shit in there,

18
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,308
with people's faces being all out of WHEOOO!

19
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,772
I can't tell if that shit is real.

20
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:46,308
That shit is scary!

21
00:01:46,683 --> 00:01:47,877
That's some scary shit!

22
00:01:48,251 --> 00:01:51,880
This thing creeped me out so bad, I'm not lying here,

23
00:01:52,255 --> 00:01:54,553
so bad I was like creeped to sh...like serious.

24
00:01:54,924 --> 00:01:55,288
The ending.

25
00:01:55,692 --> 00:02:00,959
I need to talk about the ending,
because this ending was one of the worst fuckin' endings

26
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:02,161
I have ever seen in my life.

27
00:02:02,532 --> 00:02:08,835
I think I'm going to give this film Grave Encounters
a pass...one skull out of four.

28
00:02:09,372 --> 00:02:11,169
I believe that's it for this week.

29
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:14,704
This has been Alex's Movie Madness...

30
00:02:15,178 --> 00:02:16,509
ah, please subscribe to my channel,

31
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,371

32
00:02:19,782 --> 00:02:22,580
Thank you for watching...and Happy Halloween!

33
00:02:29,626 --> 00:02:30,650
Whoa, whoa!

34
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,028
- Where you guys going?
- Wouldn't you like to know.

35
00:02:33,396 --> 00:02:35,387
- Ah, lucky!
- Hey, give me your number!

36
00:02:37,734 --> 00:02:38,701
Look at me, motherfucker!

37
00:02:39,068 --> 00:02:39,762
Hah, hah!

38
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,903
Oh my God, he ha ha,Tessa.

39
00:02:48,278 --> 00:02:50,212
- Tap that ass, baby!
- Fuck off Trevor.

40
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,104
Isn't there some freshman you can go grope here?

41
00:02:52,482 --> 00:02:53,005
I hope so.

42
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:57,375
I know you don't like dick, but c'mon,
you gotta be willing to make an exception.

43
00:02:57,754 --> 00:02:59,745
How you doin'?
Is he gay or what?

44
00:03:00,123 --> 00:03:01,112
Happy Halloween!

45
00:03:01,491 --> 00:03:04,187
Oh, my God!
That's awesome... r...wha...er...

46
00:03:04,594 --> 00:03:06,585
You want to make out with a Greek god?
Yeah.

47
00:03:06,963 --> 00:03:09,989
So are you Michael from Thriller
or are you dead Michael over here?

48
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,368
Oh, I'm dead Michael, baby.
Wooo!

49
00:03:13,102 --> 00:03:14,569
Where the children at?
Aaaah!

50
00:03:14,938 --> 00:03:16,906
Give me some more.

51
00:03:18,174 --> 00:03:20,699
Wait, you're rolling up in here
with this little piece of shit?

52
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,202
Oh, woh, woh, woh, alright?

53
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:25,843
My, my camera may be small, right,
but my Thor has a mighty big hammer dick,

54
00:03:26,182 --> 00:03:27,774
unlike yours, tiny eight.

55
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:31,746
Yeah, baby!

56
00:03:32,121 --> 00:03:33,247
Hah, ha, ha.

57
00:03:35,525 --> 00:03:37,493
What have we got over here?

58
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,054
Oh, my God.

59
00:03:39,462 --> 00:03:40,622
Jennifer!

60
00:03:41,197 --> 00:03:43,222
....When am I not filming?
- Where's Alex?

61
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:45,066
- I dunno know.
- Is he here?

62
00:03:45,435 --> 00:03:47,266
- Did he come with you?
- He did not come with me.

63
00:03:47,637 --> 00:03:49,764
Wow, I was really looking forward to seeing him tonight.

64
00:03:50,206 --> 00:03:52,071
Do you wanna make out?

65
00:03:52,475 --> 00:03:52,839
I'm in.

66
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:54,904
I'll take a rain check.
You should keep drinking, though.

67
00:03:55,311 --> 00:03:56,938
It'll taste better.
Ah,ha ha.

68
00:03:58,147 --> 00:03:59,512
Back at the dorms.

69
00:04:06,122 --> 00:04:08,113
Shit!
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

70
00:04:08,491 --> 00:04:09,150
Ahh!

71
00:04:12,228 --> 00:04:13,923
Learn to fucking knock, bro!

72
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,855
Get that fucking camera out of my face.
There's a fuckin' rager going on at Beta Alpha Kapa...

73
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:18,325
and you're here jacking off!

74
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:19,531
Are you kidding me?

75
00:04:19,902 --> 00:04:23,861
There's a real pussy out there waiting for you, man.
Jen wants your body, bro.

76
00:04:25,341 --> 00:04:25,830
Jennifer's there?

77
00:04:26,209 --> 00:04:28,074
Like I said, she's lookin' good.

78
00:04:29,512 --> 00:04:32,675
Not as good as this, but...pretty good.

79
00:04:33,049 --> 00:04:34,482
I don't have a fuckin' costume, so I can't go.

80
00:04:34,851 --> 00:04:36,819
Wrong!
You do have a costume.

81
00:04:37,253 --> 00:04:38,550
I have one left over from Frosh Week.

82
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:41,219
No.
I'm not fucking...I'm not fucking wearing this!

83
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:42,888
- Ah, you are wearing this.
- I'm not fucking wearing this.

84
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,558
- It's Halloween.
- I am not...No...absolutely fucking not.

85
00:04:49,532 --> 00:04:51,966
I cannot believe you let me talk me into this.

86
00:04:52,435 --> 00:04:53,800
Hee, hee, seriously!

87
00:04:54,203 --> 00:04:56,228
- Your ass is banging, dude.
- Look at this.

88
00:04:56,606 --> 00:04:57,470
Fuck off, dude.

89
00:04:57,874 --> 00:04:59,865
I'm not going out in public like this.

90
00:05:01,878 --> 00:05:03,175
- Hey Trev! Buddy!
- All right, my man!

91
00:05:03,546 --> 00:05:05,013
You should listen, listen to this.

92
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:08,009
Fuckin' no class in the horror genre anymore.

93
00:05:08,384 --> 00:05:11,012
No class. I'm telling you.
It's all just quick cuts...

94
00:05:11,387 --> 00:05:12,354
...and giant lens flares.

95
00:05:12,722 --> 00:05:15,190
CGI.
They need to go back to using models...

96
00:05:15,558 --> 00:05:17,025
- and make up effects.
- Yes! I am...

97
00:05:17,393 --> 00:05:18,052
- Yes, they do.
- ...in total agreement with you.

98
00:05:18,428 --> 00:05:20,623
- You're so right, Alex. You're so smart.
- It's the old school. The old school way.

99
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,361
Oh, I am on the same page with you.

100
00:05:22,732 --> 00:05:24,097
Carpenter, Craven...

101
00:05:24,467 --> 00:05:25,729
Where the fuck are those guys in our generation?

102
00:05:26,102 --> 00:05:27,034
Where the fuck are you?

103
00:05:27,403 --> 00:05:29,871
This film school fuck's the next Craven.

104
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:30,864
- Who?
- None of them.

105
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,104
I'll tell you where they are.

106
00:05:32,475 --> 00:05:33,499
Right here brother.

107
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:34,535
Speech!

108
00:05:34,911 --> 00:05:36,435
My name is Alex Wright.

109
00:05:36,813 --> 00:05:39,509
Future motherfucking genius, baby!

110
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:42,214
Alex Wright's got an announcement, ladies and gentlemen...

111
00:05:42,585 --> 00:05:44,610
I am going to make a horror film...

112
00:05:45,488 --> 00:05:47,479
...that will reinvent the genre!

113
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,255
- Yeah, you are!
- You know it.

114
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,059
I know it.
It is going to be artistic.

115
00:05:52,428 --> 00:05:54,726
It's going to have...vision.

116
00:05:55,098 --> 00:05:59,057
'Cause I'm a fuckin' visionary!
And I'm allowed to say shit like that.

117
00:05:59,469 --> 00:06:01,562
Party on, motherfuckers!

118
00:06:10,179 --> 00:06:11,942
Ahhhhh, that's glorious.

119
00:06:13,983 --> 00:06:15,575
Sleeping Beauty...

120
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,550
Rise and shine, bitch!

121
00:06:26,028 --> 00:06:26,824
Mhhh.

122
00:06:27,196 --> 00:06:28,686
How you feeling, big guy?

123
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:31,930
Look at you.

124
00:06:32,468 --> 00:06:33,435
Who's your friend?

125
00:06:33,803 --> 00:06:34,462
Fuck!

126
00:06:34,837 --> 00:06:36,304
You might want to check your timeline.

127
00:06:38,474 --> 00:06:39,304
Why?

128
00:06:40,476 --> 00:06:43,673
I mean, theres some pretty racy photos of you on there
from last night.

129
00:06:45,648 --> 00:06:46,672
What did you do?

130
00:06:47,316 --> 00:06:48,442
Just tell me what the hell you did.

131
00:06:49,218 --> 00:06:49,912
Keep looking.

132
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,308
You'll see it.

133
00:06:52,655 --> 00:06:54,782
- Ah...ah, there's a sexy one.
- Looks like he's grabbing my tits.

134
00:06:55,158 --> 00:06:55,647
Well, there's the thing.

135
00:06:56,025 --> 00:06:57,549
Why the hell would you let me drink
a whole thing of tequila?

136
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,951
You took it from me and wouldn't give it back.

137
00:07:00,329 --> 00:07:02,194
- Who the hell is this dude?
- No idea.

138
00:07:02,832 --> 00:07:03,924
Jared's a horndog.

139
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,494
Really drunk.

140
00:07:06,903 --> 00:07:07,927
He teabagged you, hmgh.

141
00:07:08,337 --> 00:07:10,703
What the fuck, man.
Why the fuck would you put that up?

142
00:07:11,073 --> 00:07:12,938
- Take it down!
- No, no, no, no. Look, look.

143
00:07:13,342 --> 00:07:14,969
I even tagged it.
Look, I said "my balls."

144
00:07:15,344 --> 00:07:17,539
- I don't give a shit.
- It's a fucking YouTube sensation.

145
00:07:17,914 --> 00:07:21,247
It's got fucking 26 likes, man.
My balls are gonna go viral, baby.

146
00:07:22,185 --> 00:07:24,016
- You fuckin' kidding me?
- Group shot.

147
00:07:24,387 --> 00:07:24,819
Mwahh!

148
00:07:25,188 --> 00:07:27,986
Not one fucking person tried to fucking help me?

149
00:07:28,357 --> 00:07:31,656
They were very...Dude, it was still you.
You were the center of attention, man.

150
00:07:32,028 --> 00:07:33,723
- You were practically a star.
- I'm untagging myself.

151
00:07:34,096 --> 00:07:34,960
I'm untagging myself.

152
00:07:35,364 --> 00:07:35,728
Fuck you.

153
00:07:36,098 --> 00:07:38,430
Hi, do you guys know where I can find, ah, weed?

154
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:39,801
Marijuana?

155
00:07:40,703 --> 00:07:43,536
Yo, dude. I'm looking for weed.

156
00:07:49,712 --> 00:07:51,145
It's my doc assignment:

157
00:07:52,415 --> 00:07:54,508
High times in film school.

158
00:07:55,418 --> 00:07:56,544
All right.

159
00:07:56,953 --> 00:07:57,544
What are you doing?

160
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,548
Just, ah, checking for comments on my reviews.

161
00:08:01,557 --> 00:08:03,047
You're such a nerd.

162
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,521
Whatever, man.

163
00:08:04,894 --> 00:08:06,691
My reviews are a good way to get my name out there.

164
00:08:07,063 --> 00:08:07,654
Check it out.

165
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,461
I got a video response.

166
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:17,199
It's a guy from the film I just reviewed,
'Grave Encounters'.

167
00:08:32,989 --> 00:08:35,617
Weird though, I don't remember this scene being in it.

168
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,083
Well, who sent the video?

169
00:08:38,461 --> 00:08:38,927
Ah, Death Awaits.

170
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:42,553
Death Awaits.

171
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,494
Message Death Awaits.

172
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:47,493
Find out where he got the video.

173
00:08:47,837 --> 00:08:49,134
Boom, problem solved.

174
00:08:49,505 --> 00:08:51,473
Can we please go get some tacos?

175
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:07,847
Gary!

176
00:09:08,491 --> 00:09:09,685
Gary, stop. That's enough!

177
00:09:10,426 --> 00:09:12,121
Don't be such a tease, Stacy.

178
00:09:12,495 --> 00:09:13,792
You know you like it.

179
00:09:16,165 --> 00:09:16,995
Gary!

180
00:09:17,366 --> 00:09:17,957
Gary!

181
00:09:18,334 --> 00:09:19,323
Stop!!

182
00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:20,661
Ow!

183
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:22,468
You bitch!

184
00:09:24,307 --> 00:09:29,836
Look, I know it's been exactly a year ago tonight
that your father disappeared,

185
00:09:30,212 --> 00:09:31,839
but you need to move on, already.

186
00:09:35,685 --> 00:09:37,175
Awh, awh!

187
00:09:42,858 --> 00:09:43,984
That fucking tease!

188
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:54,936
Hello?

189
00:09:55,404 --> 00:09:56,564
Who's out there?

190
00:09:59,008 --> 00:10:02,034
Whoever's doing this, it's not funny anymore!

191
00:10:05,581 --> 00:10:06,548
Gary!

192
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,415
C'mon, what is taking so long?

193
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,987
Oh, c'mon!

194
00:10:18,561 --> 00:10:24,090
Gary, Gary, ah, I'm sorry.

195
00:10:25,034 --> 00:10:28,026
Ah, okay, lets...let's just go.

196
00:10:28,404 --> 00:10:29,428
I'm cold.

197
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,372
Gary?

198
00:10:38,381 --> 00:10:41,544
NOOOOOOOOO!

199
00:10:41,917 --> 00:10:43,009
And...cut!

200
00:10:43,386 --> 00:10:45,047
- Cut! That was money.
- Top take two. Mark.

201
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:46,080
Money.

202
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:48,785
Jared, we're going to go to the,
ah, bird's-eye view shot. Is that good?

203
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:49,955
Yeah, that sounds good.

204
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:51,018
Oh, my God, Jennifer.

205
00:10:51,394 --> 00:10:53,760
You are officially on your way
to being the next great scream queen.

206
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,563
- And I'm going to help you get to that spot.
- Really? - Yes!

207
00:10:55,931 --> 00:10:58,957
Ah, Alex, how is a guy supposed to stand up
after he's dead?

208
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:00,801
That, that doesn't make any sense.

209
00:11:01,137 --> 00:11:02,764
That's gonna be an awesome jump-scare.
Trust me, man.

210
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:03,833
I know what I'm doing.

211
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,605
I'm a pro.

212
00:11:05,975 --> 00:11:07,442
Trev, Death Awaits replied.

213
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:08,435
Who?

214
00:11:08,811 --> 00:11:09,505
What did he say?

215
00:11:09,912 --> 00:11:10,776
Well, check it out.

216
00:11:13,482 --> 00:11:16,349
What, wha, what is that?
Is that a phone number or something?

217
00:11:16,952 --> 00:11:18,647
Forty-nine, fourteen, one-twenty...

218
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:20,988
Nah, it's too many numbers to be a phone number.

219
00:11:21,457 --> 00:11:22,947
Who, who is this?
Who sent it?

220
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:24,917
Alex has a YouTube stalker.

221
00:11:26,629 --> 00:11:29,894
Doesn't make sense. I checked out the websites.
I double-checked it out with Google Maps.

222
00:11:30,332 --> 00:11:31,993
It doesn't make sense, man.
I just don't know why he sent it to me.

223
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:32,890
No, no, no. Wey, wey, wait.

224
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:36,727
Go back to that, to that last part where you were saying
about the longitude latitude numbers.

225
00:11:37,106 --> 00:11:37,800
That was good stuff.

226
00:11:38,174 --> 00:11:38,936
Okay, yeah, all right.

227
00:11:39,308 --> 00:11:42,004
Forty-nine, fourteen, a hundred and twenty-two,
forty-eight.

228
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:46,108
The message from Death Awaits.
It's...longitude and latitude numbers, I think.

229
00:11:46,482 --> 00:11:47,574
Where do you think they lead to?

230
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:52,387
Vancouver, Canada, to the exact location
of a mental institution called... [CENSORED]

231
00:11:53,189 --> 00:11:55,453
Now, I think this is the place
where they filmed Grave Encounters.

232
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:59,458
They called the building Collingwood within the movie,

233
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:02,923
but Collingwood doesn't exist...
(CENSORED) does.

234
00:12:03,499 --> 00:12:05,091
And it's all the same shit they talked about.

235
00:12:05,468 --> 00:12:08,596
Ya know, built at the turn of the century,
crazy doctors, lobotomy...All that shit.

236
00:12:08,971 --> 00:12:10,336
It's all real.
It all happened.

237
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,299
Where the hell's the night vision button?

238
00:12:16,946 --> 00:12:18,379
There it is.

239
00:12:22,485 --> 00:12:23,975
Where the fuck are you?

240
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,485
Dude, Trev, look at this.

241
00:12:29,658 --> 00:12:31,683
- I can see why people think this is scary.
- You watchin' this?

242
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:35,093
So many people online think this is real.
I'm not the only one.

243
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:40,795
People thought the Blair Witch Project was real, too.

244
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:44,628
Yeah, and Paranormal Activity,
and that stupid one in space on the moon.

245
00:12:45,007 --> 00:12:46,338
It's just a marketing gimmick, Alex.

246
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:48,700
That's exactly what they want you to think.
It's just a movie.

247
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,806
And...I mean, it's not even a very good movie at that.

248
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:53,671
I mean, look at these special effects.

249
00:12:54,049 --> 00:12:57,541
None of the actors in this film have done anything
since this film release. Not a thing.

250
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,287
Can you explain that?
He's been dead for fuckin', like, eight years now.

251
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,317
Kenny Sandwall.

252
00:13:03,692 --> 00:13:06,855
Suicide. 2004.
Self-inflicted shotgun wound.

253
00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:08,185
The dude went crazy.

254
00:13:08,564 --> 00:13:11,499
What about your own movie, Alex?
You still need to cast the role of the police sergeant.

255
00:13:11,867 --> 00:13:13,664
You need to get on that shit ASAP.

256
00:13:16,539 --> 00:13:17,005
Hey everybody.

257
00:13:17,373 --> 00:13:22,572
I actually have some questions that I need help
getting answers for the movie I was reviewing last week,

258
00:13:22,945 --> 00:13:23,809
Grave Encounters.

259
00:13:24,246 --> 00:13:28,376
I'm trying to get in touch with the directors
or some of the actors or anyone involved with the film,

260
00:13:28,751 --> 00:13:30,685
but I can't find any information on them.

261
00:13:31,053 --> 00:13:33,647
There's something about it that doesn't make sense,
and I just kinda want to get to the bottom of it.

262
00:13:34,023 --> 00:13:38,016
So if you or anybody you know
knows how to get in contact with them,

263
00:13:38,394 --> 00:13:39,691
please just comment back.

264
00:13:40,062 --> 00:13:41,495
It would be greatly appreciated.

265
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:07,821
Help!

266
00:14:08,157 --> 00:14:10,022
Help! Somebody help me!

267
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,984
Help!

268
00:14:14,463 --> 00:14:15,794
Please, please

269
00:14:16,165 --> 00:14:16,859
Why are you doing this?

270
00:14:17,266 --> 00:14:18,233
Just let me go.

271
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:19,190
Aah!

272
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:22,601
Help! Help!

273
00:14:25,474 --> 00:14:26,441
Aaaahhhh!

274
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,072
Time for your appointment.

275
00:14:29,478 --> 00:14:30,502
No, no, no, no, no.

276
00:14:32,181 --> 00:14:33,113
Aah!

277
00:14:33,616 --> 00:14:36,141
Aaah, you fucking psycho!

278
00:14:36,685 --> 00:14:38,380
Looks like you've got a cavity.

279
00:14:52,134 --> 00:14:52,657
Please.

280
00:14:55,204 --> 00:14:58,002
No, no, no, no, no, please no.

281
00:14:59,041 --> 00:14:59,973
This might sting a little.

282
00:15:00,342 --> 00:15:01,172
Please, no.

283
00:15:01,677 --> 00:15:05,545
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhheeeeeeiiiiiiii!

284
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:06,312
Cut!

285
00:15:06,682 --> 00:15:07,341
Cut, cut.

286
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:08,644
Ah!

287
00:15:09,218 --> 00:15:10,014
What'd you think?

288
00:15:10,552 --> 00:15:11,519
- D'ya like it?
- Umm.

289
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:13,584
It, it was good.
It wa...it was good.

290
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:15,287
I just, ah, I just got some...

291
00:15:15,658 --> 00:15:16,682
I'm just trying to think.
I got some stuff.

292
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:18,720
You don't seem very happy about it.

293
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:22,563
- Like, was it my performance? You want me to do it differently?
- No, not all. It wasn't your performance.

294
00:15:22,898 --> 00:15:25,366
Well no, because, like, I rehearsed this
four different ways, so we can...

295
00:15:25,734 --> 00:15:27,065
Not your fault, okay?

296
00:15:27,369 --> 00:15:28,961
- It's not...
- Dude, what the fuck you talking about, man?

297
00:15:29,338 --> 00:15:30,202
The footage looks amazing.

298
00:15:30,572 --> 00:15:32,836
It looks...good.
I'll give you that, but its cliche, man.

299
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,733
Look there's a guy in a mask and a girl getting tied up.
We've seen this before.

300
00:15:36,145 --> 00:15:39,114
Yeah, dude, it's fuckin' torture porn, man.
People love that shit.

301
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:40,914
Saw made like a hundred million dollars.

302
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,274
Yeah, I don't really care.

303
00:15:42,685 --> 00:15:44,118
I dunno.
I need to rethink the whole third act.

304
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:46,681
Just wrap everyone, okay?
I need to rewrite the ending.

305
00:15:47,856 --> 00:15:49,687
All right everybody.
That's a wrap for today.

306
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:51,015
- Really?
- Fuck, yeah.

307
00:15:51,393 --> 00:15:53,361
Ah, hell, yeah!
Let's go get day-drunk.

308
00:15:56,031 --> 00:15:58,864
Hey, Jen, that was really good.

309
00:15:59,601 --> 00:16:00,590
That was scary.

310
00:16:01,036 --> 00:16:01,900
Thanks.

311
00:16:02,371 --> 00:16:05,465
- Turn that frown upside down.
- Sorry...Can you not film me right now?

312
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:12,176
All right. So I just logged on to my email,
and I had a message from that YouTube user

313
00:16:12,548 --> 00:16:14,311
that's been messing with me for the last little while.

314
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:15,547
Check out what he sent me.

315
00:16:16,552 --> 00:16:19,680
This is a photo of Sean Rogerson
when he was younger.

316
00:16:20,055 --> 00:16:21,818
The woman next to him must be his mother.

317
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:23,885
It came with a phone number.

318
00:16:24,393 --> 00:16:26,418
It's, ah, local to Washington,
so I'm going to give it a shot.

319
00:16:26,795 --> 00:16:27,989
Maybe it has something to do with his mom.

320
00:16:28,397 --> 00:16:29,227
See what I can find out.

321
00:16:29,598 --> 00:16:31,065
[Phone ringing]
- Hello?

322
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,363
Hi, is this the, ah, Rogerson home?

323
00:16:33,736 --> 00:16:34,395
Yes.

324
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,863
And I'm just trying to get a hold of Sean.
Is he around?

325
00:16:37,239 --> 00:16:38,900
Why do you want to speak to Sean?

326
00:16:39,274 --> 00:16:43,540
Well, I'm doing a thesis project
on a film he was a part of called Grave Encounters.

327
00:16:43,912 --> 00:16:45,402
I'm trying to get an interview with him.

328
00:16:45,781 --> 00:16:50,309
It would be really helpful if you guys...
if I wasn't the only one who was navigating...

329
00:16:51,253 --> 00:16:51,912
Well, you aren't.

330
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:53,376
The GPS is helping you out.

331
00:16:53,756 --> 00:16:55,417
Well, yeah, a lot of good that did us.

332
00:16:56,091 --> 00:16:57,718
This is why Terminator turned bad.

333
00:16:59,428 --> 00:17:00,258
They don't want to help us.

334
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:01,891
Computers don't want to help us.

335
00:17:02,264 --> 00:17:03,094
It's just in their nature.

336
00:17:03,465 --> 00:17:04,159
This is it.

337
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,989
It would appear to be.

338
00:17:07,102 --> 00:17:09,036
All right, so what's this broad's name again?

339
00:17:09,805 --> 00:17:11,568
Delia, Trevor, for the eighteenth time.

340
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,238
And she said that Sean would be here for sure?

341
00:17:14,777 --> 00:17:17,211
Sean would be here at three o'clock,
he'd be down for an interview.

342
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:18,409
Let's make it happen.

343
00:17:18,781 --> 00:17:19,907
Ich, ni, san, let's go.

344
00:17:20,282 --> 00:17:21,544
- Jared, you...
- What?

345
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:22,713
...ah, hold back.

346
00:17:22,951 --> 00:17:24,646
We're going to film this from a wide...

347
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,009
See I don't know why you brought your camera.

348
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:26,887
Why'd you bring your camera?

349
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:28,917
It's for my fucking documentary,
for the fifteenth time.

350
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:32,556
- Your documentary doesn't really apply to this scenario.
- Your documentary doesn't apply to this scenario.

351
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:34,623
That's precisely what my documentary
is about is this scenario...

352
00:17:34,997 --> 00:17:35,691
Shut up!

353
00:17:37,466 --> 00:17:38,990
- Hi.
- Alex?

354
00:17:39,368 --> 00:17:41,461
Yes, Alex, and this is my friend Trevor.

355
00:17:41,837 --> 00:17:42,804
Hi, I'm Trevor.

356
00:17:43,172 --> 00:17:44,139
Nice to meet you.

357
00:17:44,506 --> 00:17:46,098
Why don't you come in before you catch cold?

358
00:17:46,642 --> 00:17:47,802
Thank you.

359
00:17:48,877 --> 00:17:50,469
Guys! Wait up!

360
00:17:53,482 --> 00:17:55,347
Can, can I get you boys some tea or some coffee?

361
00:17:55,717 --> 00:17:57,344
I've got some really nice tea in the pot.

362
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,611
Um, I'm, I'm good, but thank you though.
I appreciate it.

363
00:18:00,989 --> 00:18:03,617
I'm, I'm, I'm fine as well.
I think we're all good.

364
00:18:04,526 --> 00:18:05,788
How's the, how's the frame look?

365
00:18:06,161 --> 00:18:06,855
It looks hot.

366
00:18:07,663 --> 00:18:09,790
Mrs. Rogerson, is Sean around right now?

367
00:18:10,232 --> 00:18:11,199
Ah, he just stepped out.

368
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:13,228
You just missed him, but he'll be back soon.

369
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:17,401
Okay, but, Sean is alive.
I mean, he's ah, he's ah, he's okay.

370
00:18:17,739 --> 00:18:21,505
Of course.
I'm always teasing him about being a workaholic.

371
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:24,775
He's acting on a new TV series right now.

372
00:18:25,681 --> 00:18:29,139
He loves to act.
He always wanted to be an actor, even when he was a little boy.

373
00:18:29,518 --> 00:18:30,951
You could wait for him, if you like.

374
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,885
He's going to be so pleased to see you.

375
00:18:33,255 --> 00:18:35,382
He love sit when people come 'round to visit.

376
00:18:35,757 --> 00:18:37,691
Sean lives here?

377
00:18:38,427 --> 00:18:40,588
Oh, well, all his life, yes.

378
00:18:41,096 --> 00:18:42,723
Of course, ha, ha.

379
00:18:43,098 --> 00:18:44,463
Why don't you wait up in his room?

380
00:18:45,033 --> 00:18:47,001
He'd like that.
It's up the stairs, on the right.

381
00:18:58,213 --> 00:19:01,148
Most valuable player, 1996.

382
00:19:02,451 --> 00:19:03,213
Look at this.

383
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,688
I don't think anyone has lived here for a while.

384
00:19:07,923 --> 00:19:09,618
That's definitely him when he was younger.

385
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:11,617
Yeah, he looks like the real Slim Shady.

386
00:19:12,895 --> 00:19:14,385
Ha, check out some bad hair.

387
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:15,960
Likes cats.

388
00:19:16,398 --> 00:19:17,160
You do too.

389
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:18,294
Ah, well.

390
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:20,031
Shit!

391
00:19:20,435 --> 00:19:21,959
What are you doing in here?

392
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:23,834
Sorry, who are you?

393
00:19:24,406 --> 00:19:26,203
I'm Mrs. Rogerson's caretaker.

394
00:19:26,942 --> 00:19:29,274
Yeah, um, Mrs. Rogerson actually said we could,
we could wait here.

395
00:19:29,645 --> 00:19:30,771
We have an interview with Sean.

396
00:19:31,146 --> 00:19:32,170
You need to leave now.

397
00:19:32,748 --> 00:19:34,773
- No, we have, we have...
- You need to go. - ...permission to be here.

398
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,118
You need to leave!
Out, out!

399
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:39,247
- Why...?
- Get out! Now!

400
00:19:39,621 --> 00:19:41,384
- Hey, we're not...trying to steal anything.
- This is ridiculous!

401
00:19:41,757 --> 00:19:43,588
- Like, like, she said we could come in here.
- Yeah!

402
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:45,722
- We just want to talk to Sean for a second.
- Out!

403
00:19:46,094 --> 00:19:50,531
Sean's getting back real soon,
just as soon as he gets back from the, the hospital.

404
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:52,662
Delia, which hospital do you mean.
What are you talking about?

405
00:19:53,001 --> 00:19:54,593
The hospital for crazy people.

406
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:58,235
Then you know about Grave Encounters?
You know about the TV show?

407
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:03,533
I, uh, hi, I helped him find his name,
you know, Lance Preston.

408
00:20:04,012 --> 00:20:05,036
That was his stage name.

409
00:20:05,447 --> 00:20:07,142
- Get the camera off!
- Don't touch it!

410
00:20:07,516 --> 00:20:09,040
- Out!
- All right, all right! I'm going.

411
00:20:09,451 --> 00:20:10,110
You're getting her too worked up.

412
00:20:10,485 --> 00:20:11,975
Delia, one more thing, though.
What happened to Sean, okay,

413
00:20:12,354 --> 00:20:13,184
what happened to the rest of his crew?

414
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:16,056
I really don't....She invited us here.
We're her guests.

415
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:18,256
We just want to do an interview with Sean, that's it.

416
00:20:18,961 --> 00:20:20,485
She is not supposed to answer the phone.

417
00:20:20,862 --> 00:20:24,059
She has advanced dementia.
She's going to be in full-time care in January.

418
00:20:30,205 --> 00:20:31,399
Dude, you catching that?

419
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:33,931
She knew about Grave Encounters.

420
00:20:35,043 --> 00:20:35,839
Look at her!

421
00:20:36,545 --> 00:20:38,570
- Shes fucking crazy, man!
- Yup.

422
00:20:40,215 --> 00:20:41,978
Oh my fucking God!

423
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:44,278
She's still waving!

424
00:20:44,653 --> 00:20:47,178
Dude, she's ripping him apart.
You gotta fucking roll on this.

425
00:20:47,556 --> 00:20:49,251
Yeah, dude, she was pissed after the play.

426
00:20:51,326 --> 00:20:53,123
No, Alex, the point is...

427
00:20:53,495 --> 00:20:55,190
that you said you were gonna be there,
and you fucking weren't.

428
00:20:55,564 --> 00:20:56,588
The circumstances aren't exactly...

429
00:20:56,999 --> 00:20:59,467
I know it sounds bad when you put it that way,
but it's not how it's...

430
00:20:59,835 --> 00:21:02,030
- This was important to me too and...
- I know, I know. I'm sorry.

431
00:21:02,404 --> 00:21:04,872
And you promised that you were going to be there,
and then you just weren't.

432
00:21:05,841 --> 00:21:08,105
- Like, I was looking everywhere for you...
- I know.

433
00:21:08,677 --> 00:21:10,804
I'm sorry, but look at this, seriously,
just look at this!

434
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:12,703
You are obsessed!
This is a movie!

435
00:21:13,081 --> 00:21:14,605
It's not just a fucking movie.
Listen to me.

436
00:21:15,017 --> 00:21:16,951
I called the Vancouver City registrar, okay.

437
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:19,844
The RCMP has a fucking case file dated March 28...

438
00:21:20,222 --> 00:21:22,656
- I don't care.
- ...2003. - I don't care.

439
00:21:23,091 --> 00:21:23,716
Okay...

440
00:21:24,693 --> 00:21:27,355
You know what?
I'm so sick of hearing about this fucking movie.

441
00:21:27,729 --> 00:21:30,721
You go ahead and do whatever you want.
You don't have to deal with me anymore, okay?

442
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:32,259
- Bye Jen.
- Fuck-off, Trevor.

443
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:33,361
Jen!

444
00:21:33,735 --> 00:21:34,724
No, not right now.
I'm sorry.

445
00:21:35,103 --> 00:21:35,592
Jen!

446
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,972
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

447
00:21:39,374 --> 00:21:40,170
Wow!

448
00:21:40,542 --> 00:21:42,009
What the fuck was her problem, you know?

449
00:21:44,379 --> 00:21:46,176
I feel bad, ya know.
I feel bad about the fucking play,

450
00:21:46,548 --> 00:21:47,515
but what do you want me say, huh?

451
00:21:47,883 --> 00:21:48,907
This is more important, ya know?

452
00:21:49,284 --> 00:21:52,583
- Yeah, um, I don't know...
- What? You don't agree with me?

453
00:21:53,055 --> 00:21:56,547
Well, uhh.
Okay, let me lay it down.

454
00:21:56,925 --> 00:21:58,392
A friend to a friend, okay?

455
00:22:00,562 --> 00:22:04,658
Aaahh, Jen is probably the only girl on this campus
you have the slightest chance of getting your dick wet with.

456
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,398
True.
Yeah.

457
00:22:07,235 --> 00:22:08,224
So true.

458
00:22:08,804 --> 00:22:12,900
- Yeah, yeah, thank you.
- And, and, in saying that, if I were you,

459
00:22:13,475 --> 00:22:15,636
I would lay off the whole conspiracy theory shit.

460
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:16,976
Conspiracy theory?

461
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:19,206
- Dude, I love you. I'm trying to help.
- Look at it.

462
00:22:19,581 --> 00:22:20,411
Look at the fucking evidence.

463
00:22:20,782 --> 00:22:21,146
Look at it!

464
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,984
Missing. Missing.
Crew feared dead.

465
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:25,946
Fuck!
What else do I need to fucking prove to you?

466
00:22:26,421 --> 00:22:27,547
- See what I mean?
- Yeah.

467
00:22:27,923 --> 00:22:30,187
Wake up to the fucking Rain Man, every morning.

468
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:32,820
Fuck you, dude.
The Rain Man was a fucking genius!

469
00:22:37,099 --> 00:22:42,799
Everybody, I know it has been a while since I have posted,
but a lot of crazy shit's gone on with this whole

470
00:22:43,171 --> 00:22:45,162
Grave Encounters thing in this last little while.

471
00:22:45,607 --> 00:22:48,132
I did an interview with Sean Rogerson's mom.

472
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,401
Listen to me, Grave Encounters is real.

473
00:22:52,447 --> 00:22:55,439
And my friends don't believe me,
you probably don't either, but I'm not crazy.

474
00:22:55,817 --> 00:22:57,250
I've done my research.

475
00:22:57,619 --> 00:22:59,211
I just need proof.

476
00:22:59,821 --> 00:23:05,088
I need to...go back to Tacoma...I don't know....
maybe check out some articles and look up some more...

477
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:14,565
"Okay, something just started printing''...

478
00:23:18,306 --> 00:23:22,402
Okay, so we know that the printer has just turned on.
And it's printing something, without me doing anything,

479
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:23,402
it started.

480
00:23:27,382 --> 00:23:31,079
Two, three, eight, four Melrose Ave., Los Angeles.

481
00:23:31,486 --> 00:23:33,613
This looks to be some kinda...call-sheet...
 
482
00:23:33,989 --> 00:23:37,117
for a music video or something, tomorrow, in LA.

483
00:23:37,492 --> 00:23:39,255
Hartfeld Productions...

484
00:23:40,662 --> 00:23:41,788
How do I know that name?

485
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,489
Gerry Hartfeld, he produced Grave Encounters.

486
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,695
And the call sheet that was printed off for me?

487
00:23:48,403 --> 00:23:50,166
It's for a music video he's doing tomorrow.

488
00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:54,066
I can't have you in fucking LA for two days.
Man, what about our movie?

489
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,172
This is more important to me.

490
00:23:56,645 --> 00:24:00,775
Are you really seriously gonna fly all the way over to LA
just for some stupid call sheet?

491
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:03,617
I'm only gonna be gone for two days.
I don't see the big deal.

492
00:24:04,853 --> 00:24:06,150
Whatever, dude.

493
00:24:07,856 --> 00:24:08,390
The life vests should only be inflated...

494
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,789
The life vests should only be inflated...

495
00:24:20,368 --> 00:24:22,893
Yeah, you're now being filmed from outside...the car.

496
00:24:23,271 --> 00:24:29,608
We're in LA...as in Hollywood...the, ah,
film Mecca of Earth.

497
00:24:30,045 --> 00:24:32,309
I wouldn't say "beautiful" cause of all the smog, but...

498
00:24:34,883 --> 00:24:36,475
Okay, we're at the studio...

499
00:24:38,453 --> 00:24:40,887
I'm with, ah, Hartfeld Productions.

500
00:24:41,389 --> 00:24:42,083
You're name?

501
00:24:42,624 --> 00:24:46,822
Ah, Roberto...Smith.
I got, ah, I've got this call sheet.

502
00:24:47,262 --> 00:24:48,229
I'm PAing today.
Music video.

503
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:50,562
Music video.

504
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:52,021
All right, Roberto.

505
00:24:53,568 --> 00:24:55,263
You go in in Lot C.

506
00:24:55,804 --> 00:24:56,736
- Thank you.
- Okay.

507
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:11,943
Movie people.

508
00:25:28,436 --> 00:25:30,131
That's him.
That's Gerry Hartfeld.

509
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:35,232
Cut it!
Cut, cut!

510
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:38,408
Guys, where's the confetti?
We're two hours behind, let's go!

511
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,576
Reset!

512
00:25:40,181 --> 00:25:42,706
I found Gerry.
I'm going to go try and talk to him now.

513
00:25:44,853 --> 00:25:46,650
No, no,no, no, I'm not gonna cover it over...

514
00:25:47,022 --> 00:25:47,852
'Scuse me, Mr. Hartfeld.

515
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:49,848
Can I talk to you for a second?

516
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:51,288
Hold on a sec.

517
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,251
Who the hell are you?

518
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:54,592
I'm Alex Wright.
I'm filming a documentary,

519
00:25:54,963 --> 00:25:56,931
and I, uh, just want to maybe get an interview with you.

520
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:58,459
Okay, this is not allowed on my set, okay?

521
00:25:58,833 --> 00:26:01,267
And you can stop it right there,
because I am not gonna do any goddamn interview.

522
00:26:01,636 --> 00:26:02,068
Security?

523
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:03,768
This guy is not supposed to be here.

524
00:26:04,139 --> 00:26:04,935
Playback!

525
00:26:05,307 --> 00:26:07,002
I know about Grave Encounters.
I know what the fuck you did!

526
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:09,036
- You get him out of here!
- What the fuck'd you do?

527
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:14,472
Hm...I just tried to talk to Gerry Hartfeld.

528
00:26:15,216 --> 00:26:18,811
He had security kick me out,
I mean he's clearly hiding something.

529
00:26:20,355 --> 00:26:23,688
Fuck, I just...Idon't know,
I don't know what to do anymore.

530
00:26:25,827 --> 00:26:26,486
Whoa!

531
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:32,463
Yeah?

532
00:26:32,834 --> 00:26:34,199
I'll talk to you, okay?

533
00:26:34,703 --> 00:26:36,330
But not here, and not on camera.

534
00:26:37,305 --> 00:26:39,773
You be at my offices tomorrow at two o'clock, hmm?

535
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:41,965
Yeah, okay.

536
00:26:42,344 --> 00:26:43,436
- Thank you.
- Mmmhh.

537
00:26:49,751 --> 00:26:50,615
Fuck, yeah!

538
00:26:54,389 --> 00:26:56,721
Testing, testing, one, two, three?

539
00:26:57,092 --> 00:26:58,059
Testing.

540
00:26:58,593 --> 00:26:59,685
Give me some good stuff.

541
00:27:07,369 --> 00:27:09,064
Welcome to Hartfeld Productions.
How can I help you?

542
00:27:09,437 --> 00:27:11,234
I have a meeting with Gerry at two o'clock.

543
00:27:11,439 --> 00:27:12,804
- Alex?
- Yeah.

544
00:27:13,208 --> 00:27:14,232
Please sign in.

545
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:20,845
So, how much do you know, hmm?
Give it to me straight.

546
00:27:22,217 --> 00:27:23,241
I know everything.

547
00:27:23,718 --> 00:27:25,379
I know Grave Encounters was real.

548
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,047
I know Sean Rogerson and the rest of the crew are dead.

549
00:27:28,423 --> 00:27:31,415
To be clear, unless there's actually a body,
you're not legally dead.

550
00:27:31,793 --> 00:27:32,657
You're a missing person.

551
00:27:33,061 --> 00:27:34,255
And, thank God for that.

552
00:27:34,629 --> 00:27:35,391
So, you admit it.

553
00:27:35,764 --> 00:27:36,856
The footage is real.

554
00:27:37,232 --> 00:27:38,529
Yeah.
Every last frame of it.

555
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,664
Well, except for a few cheap visual effects
that we added at the last minute.

556
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:43,162
What about the...families?

557
00:27:43,605 --> 00:27:46,597
Christ, kid!
It's called the non-disclosure agreement.

558
00:27:47,242 --> 00:27:48,709
You made them sign a non-disclosure agreement?

559
00:27:49,077 --> 00:27:50,442
You're goddamn right I did, and you know what?

560
00:27:50,812 --> 00:27:53,246
For a nice chunk of settlement money,
they were more than happy to sign it.

561
00:27:53,648 --> 00:27:56,344
You think I'm a big scumbag, right?

562
00:27:56,751 --> 00:27:58,946
I guess I just don't understand why you did it.

563
00:28:00,088 --> 00:28:03,080
Listen, when I first saw those tapes, I was scared to death.

564
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:04,117
You understand?

565
00:28:04,492 --> 00:28:05,982
I mean, I even thought about destroying them.

566
00:28:07,328 --> 00:28:11,662
But after all the settlements,
I was close to bankruptcy, and so...I had an idea.
 
567
00:28:12,467 --> 00:28:13,764
Why not release it as a film?

568
00:28:14,135 --> 00:28:15,932
You know, maybe we could recoup some of our losses.

569
00:28:16,304 --> 00:28:18,602
And it worked great.
They already want a sequel.

570
00:28:19,607 --> 00:28:21,438
Grave Encounters 2.
Can you believe that?

571
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:23,778
The directors, the Vicious Brothers, who are they?

572
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:26,941
Um, why don't you follow me?

573
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,977
When you fuck this thing up...
when ya, when ya put the audio...

574
00:28:31,352 --> 00:28:32,979
Meet the Vicious Brothers.

575
00:28:33,354 --> 00:28:34,378
Hey Gerry.

576
00:28:34,989 --> 00:28:37,787
Yeah.
That's Colin, right there, and that's Stu.

577
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,524
They're my interns.

578
00:28:39,961 --> 00:28:44,421
See, I just had these guys pretend to be the directors
of the film and then go out and do all the press.

579
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,324
And because they're non-union,
I don't have to pay them scale...

580
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:53,271
Hah, you know, you get all these students,
and all these kids up here from UCLA and USC,

581
00:28:53,641 --> 00:28:54,903
and they're just so goddamn incompetent...

582
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:56,402
So now you know the truth.

583
00:28:56,778 --> 00:28:57,802
How you gonna get away with this?

584
00:28:58,179 --> 00:28:58,975
We already have.

585
00:28:59,347 --> 00:29:00,143
I'm gonna tell everybody.

586
00:29:00,515 --> 00:29:02,176
You go ahead.
Who's gonna listen to you?

587
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,244
You're a nobody.

588
00:29:03,651 --> 00:29:06,484
The only reason I agreed to this meeting was
to see if you had anything solid against me.

589
00:29:06,855 --> 00:29:08,117
Which...you don't.

590
00:29:08,556 --> 00:29:09,045
We'll see about that.

591
00:29:09,457 --> 00:29:12,426
Yeah. Yeah, we will.
I'm gonna leave now.

592
00:29:14,529 --> 00:29:16,190
The guy's a fuckin' douchbag.

593
00:29:16,664 --> 00:29:18,291
Who's gonna listen to you?
You're a nobody.

594
00:29:19,534 --> 00:29:21,502
See?
This is why I asked you to come.

595
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,801
Well, yeah, man, I mean if this is true, that's fucked up.

596
00:29:24,172 --> 00:29:25,264
I didn't ask him to say any of this.

597
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,767
Wow!
He's a fuckin' douche!

598
00:29:28,209 --> 00:29:30,404
Well, he's also right.
I mean nobody's gonna believe us.

599
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:32,143
We need proof, ya know.

600
00:29:33,181 --> 00:29:34,205
What d'ya mean, proof?

601
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:39,810
I've been thinking a lot about this.
Guys, this is the film I wanna make, right?

602
00:29:40,655 --> 00:29:42,623
Okay, think about it.
We're already in the second act, right?

603
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:45,824
I mean, you've been filming everything on your...
camera phone?

604
00:29:46,194 --> 00:29:47,627
Jared, you've been filming it.
Think about it, dude.

605
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:50,487
It's a documentary, but it's also a horror film, right?

606
00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:52,730
How is it a horror film?

607
00:29:53,101 --> 00:29:54,432
Okay, I got another message from Death Awaits.

608
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:57,999
He lives in Canada, right beside the hospital
where they shot Grave Encounters.

609
00:29:58,373 --> 00:29:59,567
That's how he knows so much about it.

610
00:29:59,941 --> 00:30:02,569
See, he wants to meet us on the inside of the building.

611
00:30:02,944 --> 00:30:04,434
That...is where we get our proof.

612
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:06,370
You want to drive to Canada?

613
00:30:06,781 --> 00:30:07,805
It's like a two-hour drive.

614
00:30:08,216 --> 00:30:10,707
We'll bring Jared, Tessa...
we'll film the whole thing.

615
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:15,316
Its a goddamn movie, man.
For the fifteenth fucking time,

616
00:30:15,723 --> 00:30:17,987
I'm not driving to Canada to go on a fuckin' wild goose chase.

617
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:19,553
- I'll go.
- Are you kidding me?

618
00:30:19,928 --> 00:30:21,190
I mean, can you explain this?

619
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:22,821
No, but...

620
00:30:23,398 --> 00:30:24,262
Why would he say that?

621
00:30:25,633 --> 00:30:26,099
I don't know.

622
00:30:26,467 --> 00:30:27,263
Jared, you in?

623
00:30:27,635 --> 00:30:29,660
You're coming, right?
Cinematography credit.

624
00:30:30,471 --> 00:30:31,267
- You're in?
- Yeah!

625
00:30:31,639 --> 00:30:32,162
Let's do this!

626
00:30:32,574 --> 00:30:34,166
You're my producer.
I need you there.

627
00:30:35,143 --> 00:30:38,442
We could get into Sundance with this shit.
All right, this is the shit that could put us on the map.

628
00:30:38,813 --> 00:30:39,745
Trust me.

629
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:45,275
- Okay, all right, let's do this.
- Yes!!

630
00:30:45,653 --> 00:30:46,312
Oww!

631
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:46,921
No, we don't own it...you know who has to pay for it
gets messed up?

632
00:30:46,921 --> 00:30:49,481
No, we don't own it...you know who has to pay for it
gets messed up?

633
00:30:49,924 --> 00:30:52,722
Alex!...cuz if I'm at the border wait, honestly.

634
00:30:53,728 --> 00:30:56,424
We're going to fuckin' BC.
There's BC bud!

635
00:30:56,798 --> 00:30:59,460
Hey, you should tell us about Grave Encounters
another time.

636
00:30:59,834 --> 00:31:03,770
We are on our way to (CENSORED) Hospital.

637
00:31:04,339 --> 00:31:05,033
Makin' movies.

638
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,237
This is where we are right now, okay?

639
00:31:07,609 --> 00:31:08,541
How do you know that?

640
00:31:08,776 --> 00:31:09,572
Take it.

641
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:14,742
Border crossing!

642
00:31:15,116 --> 00:31:18,779
- We're going the right way.
- Is it illegal to bring marijuana...

643
00:31:19,153 --> 00:31:20,586
- Are you kidding me?
- ...across the border?

644
00:31:20,955 --> 00:31:22,320
No, Trevor, it's totally illegal.

645
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:24,521
Well, Canada's loose on that, right?

646
00:31:24,926 --> 00:31:25,915
Oh, my God, are you fucking kidding me?

647
00:31:26,294 --> 00:31:28,319
Alex, pull over.
We need to drop something off.

648
00:31:34,302 --> 00:31:35,735
- Oww!
- You like it so much.

649
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:37,571
I can see it in your eyes!

650
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:39,634
Do you know how to get to (CENSORED) by any chance?

651
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:48,378
- Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Vancouver.
- Vancouver!

652
00:31:50,385 --> 00:31:52,353
Keep out!
Violators will be...

653
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,744
- I'll do it.
- Then do it.

654
00:31:54,155 --> 00:31:55,122
All right.

655
00:31:56,157 --> 00:31:57,818
That's one tough bitch!

656
00:32:02,997 --> 00:32:04,487
Is there...is that it?
That's...

657
00:32:04,866 --> 00:32:06,231
Do you see that?
Are you kidding me?

658
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:07,896
- Are you looking at that building?
- You see that?

659
00:32:08,336 --> 00:32:11,931
Well, I'd say they succeeded
in building a fucking creepy building.

660
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,474
Jesus Christ!
This place is huge!

661
00:32:14,842 --> 00:32:16,707
Alex, do you know which one they shot at?

662
00:32:18,246 --> 00:32:19,372
I think this is it.

663
00:32:19,847 --> 00:32:20,711
Let's go check it out.

664
00:32:25,253 --> 00:32:26,015
[sirens wailing]

665
00:32:26,387 --> 00:32:27,012
Security guards!
Security guards.

666
00:32:27,255 --> 00:32:27,778
Oh, shit!

667
00:32:29,257 --> 00:32:30,121
Roll on this.

668
00:32:30,525 --> 00:32:32,720
Fucking Canadian rent-a-cop, you guys, seriously.

669
00:32:33,094 --> 00:32:34,459
You guys, let me do the talking.

670
00:32:34,862 --> 00:32:35,726
Trevor...

671
00:32:37,031 --> 00:32:38,623
Don't say anything.

672
00:32:41,102 --> 00:32:41,932
Sh, sh, sh...

673
00:32:43,171 --> 00:32:43,865
Excuse me.

674
00:32:44,539 --> 00:32:46,063
This is private property.
Didn't you see the sign back there?

675
00:32:46,441 --> 00:32:46,873
Sorry.

676
00:32:47,241 --> 00:32:48,071
Hi, I'm so sorry.

677
00:32:48,443 --> 00:32:52,243
We're film students, and we're just trying to get
some shots for a school project.

678
00:32:52,613 --> 00:32:54,581
We're just trying to get some exterior shots of the building.
That's all.

679
00:32:55,116 --> 00:32:56,879
Well, I'm sorry.
These buildings are full of asbestos, all right?

680
00:32:57,251 --> 00:32:58,843
It's highly dangerous.
You guys are going to have to get out of here.

681
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,016
Turn the camera off.

682
00:33:00,388 --> 00:33:02,481
No!
Absolutely not.

683
00:33:02,857 --> 00:33:05,291
You're not allowed to be filming here, okay?
Theres no filming on the premises.

684
00:33:05,626 --> 00:33:06,285
I understand that.
We'll leave.

685
00:33:06,694 --> 00:33:07,285
You're gonna, you're gonna have to give me the tape.

686
00:33:07,628 --> 00:33:09,323
- I'm not giving you shit, buddy.
- I need the tapes from all the cameras.

687
00:33:09,731 --> 00:33:11,198
- No!
- Give me the tape. Give me...Give me the tape!

688
00:33:11,566 --> 00:33:12,533
Woh, woh!

689
00:33:19,941 --> 00:33:20,703
What the fuck!

690
00:33:21,075 --> 00:33:22,201
Keep going.
Keep going, Alex!

691
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:23,872
- What the fuck just happened?
- Fuckin'...Shit!

692
00:33:24,245 --> 00:33:25,405
Just keep going.

693
00:33:26,147 --> 00:33:27,580
What a fuckin' asshole!

694
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:31,177
Why would a mental institution
that's been abandoned for over thirty years

695
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:32,883
have a fuckin' security guard, huh?

696
00:33:33,888 --> 00:33:35,185
I don't even know what to call you.

697
00:33:35,823 --> 00:33:36,915
Shhh, what are you doing?

698
00:33:37,291 --> 00:33:38,724
We're gonna get fuckin' kicked out on the first day.

699
00:33:39,127 --> 00:33:40,594
- Huh?
- Seven one three.

700
00:33:40,995 --> 00:33:42,326
This one's good.
This is it right here.

701
00:33:43,965 --> 00:33:50,837
We, uh, we just tried to capture some shots of the hospital
from outside, but we were harassed by a security guard

702
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:52,570
who tried to take one of our cameras away.

703
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,737
He said it was because of "the asbestos."

704
00:33:55,109 --> 00:33:57,942
That's...that's clearly bullshit.

705
00:33:58,312 --> 00:33:59,506
I mean, they're trying to hide the truth.

706
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:02,246
They're trying to hide something...
they don't want people to...

707
00:34:02,617 --> 00:34:04,778
Breakin' in, bitch!
Motherfuckers can't stop us!

708
00:34:05,153 --> 00:34:08,179
Well, fuck the police...eeee, ha, ha, ha!

709
00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:10,420
Knock it off!
Knock it off.

710
00:34:10,792 --> 00:34:11,451
Guys!

711
00:34:14,262 --> 00:34:15,957
Movie's fucking retarded.

712
00:34:16,364 --> 00:34:18,355
This is why we came up here, you guys actually
think the movie is real?

713
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:20,063
That's the whole point of this, Tess.

714
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:21,867
Ohh! Yeah!

715
00:34:22,203 --> 00:34:23,966
I'm not, I'm not responsible for my actions.

716
00:34:24,338 --> 00:34:25,805
I got another message from Death Awaits,

717
00:34:26,174 --> 00:34:31,009
saying to meet him in the room at the West end of the tunnel
at three a.m., sharp, tonight.

718
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:37,941
We have got, uh, eight night vision cameras
that we're going to put up on tripods like that one

719
00:34:38,319 --> 00:34:39,183
throughout the building.

720
00:34:39,554 --> 00:34:43,046
This super bad-ass camera is shooting in high resolution.

721
00:34:43,457 --> 00:34:46,153
Thermal camera.
Because we're fancy like that.

722
00:34:46,527 --> 00:34:47,687
An EMF meter.

723
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:49,255
Make mine really big.

724
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,756
That's what she said.

725
00:34:51,566 --> 00:34:52,692
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

726
00:34:53,067 --> 00:34:58,437
Tonight, we're going to try to find proof
of what Gerry Hartfeld's been trying to cover up for ten years.

727
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:07,709
That this film is the real deal, that the spirits of (CENSORED) exists,
the crew of Grave Encounters died trying to find them.

728
00:35:08,082 --> 00:35:10,448
Yeah, boy, we're going to light the fires,
we're going to kick the tires.

729
00:35:10,852 --> 00:35:12,820
Yeah, baby.
Yeah, baby.

730
00:35:20,027 --> 00:35:23,622
All right...ugh.

731
00:35:24,265 --> 00:35:25,596
- Okay, let's go!
- Let's do this!

732
00:35:29,003 --> 00:35:31,198
Oh, fuck!
It's the guard!

733
00:35:31,873 --> 00:35:32,737
Down, down, down!

734
00:35:33,441 --> 00:35:35,636
Dude, turn your light off!
Turn your light off.

735
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,376
Shhh, Tessa!

736
00:35:42,049 --> 00:35:43,038
Anybody there?

737
00:35:43,451 --> 00:35:44,110
Shhh.

738
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:45,314
Shit, get down!

739
00:35:46,254 --> 00:35:47,118
Fuck!

740
00:35:47,521 --> 00:35:48,351
Hello?

741
00:35:49,557 --> 00:35:51,388
(RADIO): ....There's some suspicious persons.

742
00:35:51,759 --> 00:35:53,522
There's a couple of guys in an old Cutlass.

743
00:35:53,895 --> 00:35:56,591
It's an off-white in colour...
parked in the parking lot for a long time.

744
00:35:56,964 --> 00:35:58,329
All right.
All right, I'm on my way.

745
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:01,694
Okay, it's time to make a break for it.
Go!

746
00:36:02,069 --> 00:36:03,696
All right, you heard the sarge.
Let's go. Move your ass.

747
00:36:04,071 --> 00:36:05,538
Shhh...that does not mean to be loud, Trevor.

748
00:36:05,907 --> 00:36:06,931
Okay, sorry.

749
00:36:08,075 --> 00:36:10,236
Oh God...Wait for me!

750
00:36:10,912 --> 00:36:14,871
Don't die baby!
Oh fuck, we'll see ghosts in here!

751
00:36:15,917 --> 00:36:16,884
Holy shit!

752
00:36:17,251 --> 00:36:18,946
- Death Awaits.
- Death Awaits.

753
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,047
Well, it's definitely the right building.

754
00:36:21,622 --> 00:36:22,714
Tess, bolt-cutters.

755
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:25,224
Oh, no, I'm doing this shit.

756
00:36:25,826 --> 00:36:26,986
- Suit yourself.
- Don't touch...

757
00:36:27,395 --> 00:36:28,327
Ooooh!

758
00:36:31,766 --> 00:36:33,393
- How come you get to wear a balaclava?
- Shhhh....

759
00:36:34,969 --> 00:36:36,061
Yeah.

760
00:36:37,238 --> 00:36:37,829
Wah!

761
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:39,433
Really?

762
00:36:39,807 --> 00:36:41,104
Oh, my God!

763
00:36:42,243 --> 00:36:43,676
- Oh wow!
- Wow!

764
00:36:44,412 --> 00:36:45,743
This place isn't creepy.

765
00:36:46,948 --> 00:36:48,415
Shit, it's just like the movie.

766
00:36:50,151 --> 00:36:51,413
Oh, my God, is that police tape?

767
00:36:51,786 --> 00:36:53,617
Why would the police, like, come here
if this was just a movie?

768
00:36:54,822 --> 00:36:56,153
'Cause it's not just a movie.

769
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,928
You done yet?
This hallway's...kind of creeping me out.

770
00:37:01,295 --> 00:37:03,286
Yeah, I'll be, I'll be done in a second.

771
00:37:04,365 --> 00:37:05,491
You're okay.

772
00:37:09,136 --> 00:37:10,160
All right!

773
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:12,796
- It's good.
- Okay, let's go.

774
00:37:15,176 --> 00:37:16,200
- Weird.
- Oh, ha, ha.

775
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,804
- This way.
- Wait. That way?

776
00:37:18,179 --> 00:37:19,203
Okay.

777
00:37:20,147 --> 00:37:21,171
I think this is the way.

778
00:37:26,787 --> 00:37:29,585
Demons in the halls.
Demons in my mind.

779
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:30,821
Demons you will find.

780
00:37:31,192 --> 00:37:33,558
- All right, let's go, let's go.
- Fuck that!

781
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:35,155
- C'mon man.
- Right.

782
00:37:35,529 --> 00:37:36,655
All right. Let's go.

783
00:37:38,499 --> 00:37:39,864
- Hurry up!
- Woah, woah, woah, woah.

784
00:37:40,234 --> 00:37:41,098
Hold on.

785
00:37:43,237 --> 00:37:44,568
Haaaaaa...

786
00:37:47,341 --> 00:37:48,968
Hey, is this where the black guy died?

787
00:37:49,844 --> 00:37:51,835
Yeah, well, the ethnics always die first.

788
00:37:53,581 --> 00:37:54,513
Whew!

789
00:38:00,254 --> 00:38:01,778
(Whistles) Shit, man.

790
00:38:02,857 --> 00:38:04,518
Damn, that's fuckin' high up.

791
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:06,456
C'mon man, let's go.

792
00:38:07,228 --> 00:38:09,423
You're gonna fuckin' fall out of there, seriously.

793
00:38:09,864 --> 00:38:11,491
Okay, guys, let's set up for the intro.

794
00:38:11,866 --> 00:38:13,857
Okay, Jared, you set the last camera in the tunnels.

795
00:38:31,752 --> 00:38:32,514
- Can't say that.
- Yes, you can.

796
00:38:32,887 --> 00:38:34,514
Alex's awesome documentary, take one.

797
00:38:34,889 --> 00:38:35,913
..typical tie-in...

798
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,222
Ready?

799
00:38:38,259 --> 00:38:43,458
It was March 20th, 2003, when Sean Rogerson
and the crew of Grave Encounters were shooting

800
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:48,961
their sixth episode of a reality television series here,
in this very building.

801
00:38:50,137 --> 00:38:51,627
They encountered something horrible.

802
00:38:52,139 --> 00:38:54,937
Something that would cut their lives tragically short.

803
00:38:55,409 --> 00:38:58,401
It was sold to the American public as fiction,

804
00:38:59,113 --> 00:39:02,241
yet in fact, it was reality.

805
00:39:04,318 --> 00:39:09,278
Later tonight, we'll be meeting up with an anonymous source
known only as Death Awaits,

806
00:39:09,657 --> 00:39:11,022
who first tipped us off.

807
00:39:11,492 --> 00:39:17,362
In the mean time, we'll be conducting our own
paranormal investigation in hopes of uncovering the truth

808
00:39:17,965 --> 00:39:19,933
behind the decade-long cover-up.

809
00:39:22,303 --> 00:39:23,895
Everybody good?
Jared?

810
00:39:24,271 --> 00:39:24,760
Yup.

811
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:26,231
- Tess, you got it?
- Yup.

812
00:39:26,607 --> 00:39:30,270
And, three, two, one.
Action!

813
00:39:31,445 --> 00:39:35,438
This building is massive, and it's super easy to get lost.

814
00:39:35,816 --> 00:39:39,650
So, to make sure that doesn't happen,
and that we can always find our way back,

815
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,614
we're dropping these glow sticks behind us.

816
00:39:44,959 --> 00:39:49,453
We have this military-grade GPS system
that we got from the spy shop.

817
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:53,857
Just in case, in the unlikely event that one of us
gets separated from the group,

818
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:56,566
we also all have these.
[air horn]

819
00:39:56,937 --> 00:39:59,098
Fuck! Would you warn me next time?
I'm wearing fucking headphones.

820
00:39:59,473 --> 00:40:00,838
- Sorry.
- Jesus!

821
00:40:01,275 --> 00:40:05,712
I think it's safe to say we're definitely prepared
for the worst.

822
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:08,479
Yewawwwwwhhhh!

823
00:40:13,287 --> 00:40:20,250
This is the very bathtub where T.C. Gibson,
a.k.a. actor Merwin Mondesor lost his life.

824
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:24,730
We will now attempt to communicate
with the spirit world in hopes of reaching Merwin.

825
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:26,632
I'm going to record an EVP.

826
00:40:28,569 --> 00:40:32,596
If the spirit of Merwin Mondesor is here with us now,
speak freely.

827
00:40:33,007 --> 00:40:36,807
Don't be afraid.
I'm sure your wife and your daughter would love to hear from you.

828
00:40:40,915 --> 00:40:45,011
RECORDING: If the spirit of Merwin Mondesor is here
with us now, speak freely.

829
00:40:45,486 --> 00:40:49,115
Don't be afraid.
I'm sure your wife and your daughter would love to hear from you.

830
00:40:54,361 --> 00:40:55,385
Sweet.

831
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:57,020
Fuck off, Trevor.

832
00:40:57,398 --> 00:41:00,231
If there are any spirits with us right now, speak freely.

833
00:41:01,168 --> 00:41:03,136
Give us a sign.
Make a noise.

834
00:41:04,038 --> 00:41:05,335
Create a cold spot.

835
00:41:07,374 --> 00:41:08,739
Jared, get the thermal camera on, ah...

836
00:41:09,109 --> 00:41:09,768
Oh, oh yeah.

837
00:41:11,579 --> 00:41:12,443
Okay, yup.

838
00:41:15,616 --> 00:41:16,640
Cool!

839
00:41:18,586 --> 00:41:19,416
Dude!

840
00:41:20,554 --> 00:41:21,748
What the fuck!

841
00:41:22,456 --> 00:41:24,549
There's like a weird mist behind Trevor.

842
00:41:25,259 --> 00:41:27,921
- What do you mean...there's a weird mist behind me? What is it?
- Just let me see what it...

843
00:41:28,295 --> 00:41:30,092
- What?
- Yes, I told you. This was real.

844
00:41:30,464 --> 00:41:31,761
- What is it?
- Ewwh!

845
00:41:32,299 --> 00:41:33,596
Aw, Trevor, you farted!

846
00:41:33,968 --> 00:41:36,061
It fucking reeks!
Awwwwh.

847
00:41:36,437 --> 00:41:37,927
Is the thermal cam picking that up?

848
00:41:38,305 --> 00:41:39,636
- Yeah.
- Seriously?

849
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,132
Keep rolling, keep rolling.

850
00:41:41,809 --> 00:41:43,174
Ewwww!

851
00:41:44,445 --> 00:41:45,434
You did.
You did it.

852
00:41:45,813 --> 00:41:47,644
You're an animal.
That's really immature.

853
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:48,810
That's awesome!

854
00:41:49,149 --> 00:41:50,275
It's so cool...

855
00:41:53,254 --> 00:41:59,250
This is the very tunnel that Sean Rogerson
spent his final moments alive, deranged and suffering

856
00:41:59,627 --> 00:42:00,616
from starvation.

857
00:42:00,995 --> 00:42:05,694
As you walk deeper down these tunnels,
it's almost as if you're walking deeper and deeper

858
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,863
into the depths of madness.

859
00:42:08,469 --> 00:42:11,996
Literally, the tension is building...with every step.

860
00:42:12,506 --> 00:42:13,370
Are you serious?

861
00:42:14,174 --> 00:42:15,607
That's a bit much.

862
00:42:16,277 --> 00:42:17,642
What's a bit much?

863
00:42:18,012 --> 00:42:20,446
- Deep in the depths of madness?
- Well you've gotta inject drama into things.
You win awards with that kind of shit.

864
00:42:20,814 --> 00:42:22,441
Yeah, you're gonna win a Razzy...

865
00:42:22,816 --> 00:42:24,181
Fuckin' gross, you guys, look.

866
00:42:24,585 --> 00:42:25,381
Eww.

867
00:42:25,753 --> 00:42:27,186
- Jared, Jared, cover this.
- Yeah, man.

868
00:42:27,655 --> 00:42:30,624
Seriously, what does this?
What leaves a half-eaten rat on the ground?

869
00:42:30,991 --> 00:42:31,855
That's disgusting.

870
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:34,955
Its says, meet in the room at the West end of the tunnels.

871
00:42:35,529 --> 00:42:37,793
Doesn't really get anymore West end than this.

872
00:42:40,134 --> 00:42:41,226
Time is it?

873
00:42:42,469 --> 00:42:43,663
Three twenty-five.

874
00:42:44,772 --> 00:42:45,704
Maybe he's running late.

875
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,371
Fuck, no.
He bailed on us.

876
00:42:47,775 --> 00:42:50,972
Without him we have nothing.
This whole project is a disaster.

877
00:42:55,649 --> 00:42:56,445
Fuck!

878
00:42:57,117 --> 00:42:57,742
What is this?

879
00:42:58,118 --> 00:42:59,050
Hell, no way!

880
00:42:59,386 --> 00:43:00,580
This is a spirit board.

881
00:43:00,988 --> 00:43:01,511
A what?

882
00:43:01,889 --> 00:43:06,383
You put your hand on the piece with somebody,
and you try and get spirits to move the letters.

883
00:43:06,794 --> 00:43:07,818
C'mon, we should play it!

884
00:43:09,063 --> 00:43:10,223
This is never gonna work.

885
00:43:10,798 --> 00:43:12,493
Yes, yes, yes.
It takes two.

886
00:43:13,033 --> 00:43:15,900
I'm speaking to the sprits of (CENSORED).

887
00:43:16,303 --> 00:43:20,933
We know that many of you were mistreated and abused here.

888
00:43:21,508 --> 00:43:24,807
You may therefore be angry in the afterlife.

889
00:43:25,979 --> 00:43:28,573
Are there any spirits here with us now?

890
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:35,017
- Well, that isn't exactly how you do it...
- Shhh!

891
00:43:35,389 --> 00:43:38,881
- Are you doing that?
- No, are you doing that?

892
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:40,649
Must be Casper!

893
00:43:41,028 --> 00:43:41,858
You're doing that.

894
00:43:42,529 --> 00:43:43,359
I'm not.

895
00:43:43,731 --> 00:43:46,825
- You're so fucking around with me.
- I'm not doing it!

896
00:43:47,334 --> 00:43:49,768
Okay, um...Who are we, who are we talking to?

897
00:43:50,104 --> 00:43:51,230
You...just give me a name.

898
00:43:53,874 --> 00:43:56,172
- Oh, my God, you guys.
- Hey, fuck off guys.

899
00:43:57,044 --> 00:44:04,712
D...E...A...T...H...

900
00:44:05,953 --> 00:44:10,083
A...W...A...I...T...S.

901
00:44:10,457 --> 00:44:11,822
- Shit, are you kidding me?
- Holy shit!

902
00:44:12,226 --> 00:44:13,090
Death Awaits.
It's not a person.

903
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,324
Fuck, the YouTube guy?

904
00:44:14,728 --> 00:44:16,252
- This is ,this is fucked.
- Shhhh!

905
00:44:16,864 --> 00:44:18,229
What do you want us to do?

906
00:44:20,067 --> 00:44:21,056
Shit!

907
00:44:24,738 --> 00:44:25,864
- Fuck me!
- Oh my God!

908
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:27,399
What does it say?

909
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,140
T...H...N...

910
00:44:30,811 --> 00:44:31,800
Film everything.

911
00:44:33,447 --> 00:44:34,539
Film everything.

912
00:44:36,984 --> 00:44:38,679
Oh, shit! Back away!
Jesus Christ!

913
00:44:39,086 --> 00:44:40,747
Guys, seriously!
This is not a joke!

914
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:43,786
You guys okay?

915
00:44:44,158 --> 00:44:45,147
Alex, let's just go.

916
00:44:46,894 --> 00:44:48,020
Ahhh!

917
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,468
What is it?
What the fuck is it?

918
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:57,760
Alex!
Move it!

919
00:45:00,107 --> 00:45:01,938
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- There's no fucking way that shit...

920
00:45:02,309 --> 00:45:03,674
- There's no way.
- Shhhh!

921
00:45:05,746 --> 00:45:07,407
- Did you get it? Did you get the coverage?
- Yeah, I got it.

922
00:45:07,781 --> 00:45:09,749
Oh, Alex, I cannot fucking believe it!

923
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:11,213
Wait a sec.

924
00:45:11,585 --> 00:45:12,552
What is it?

925
00:45:14,521 --> 00:45:15,488
[crash]

926
00:45:15,989 --> 00:45:16,853
Fucking Christ!

927
00:45:17,257 --> 00:45:18,622
Shut the fuck up!

928
00:45:19,026 --> 00:45:19,822
What was that?

929
00:45:20,694 --> 00:45:22,457
[crash]
[screaming]

930
00:45:24,631 --> 00:45:25,996
Damm it!
Don't move.

931
00:45:26,366 --> 00:45:28,527
- All right, all right. Fine!
- You just gave us a fucking heart attack!

932
00:45:28,936 --> 00:45:33,202
You realize that trespassing is a criminal offense.
Did you think I wasn't going to see the busted lock?

933
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:37,738
I understand that, but I'm not leaving without my equipment.
It's not even mine, really, it's our school's.

934
00:45:38,145 --> 00:45:40,978
I don't give a shit where it's from, all right?
You can take that up with the cops.

935
00:45:41,482 --> 00:45:43,143
God, don't be such a fucking dick, man.

936
00:45:43,517 --> 00:45:45,212
Shut up!
Shut your mouth.

937
00:45:45,619 --> 00:45:47,052
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, sir.
- You better not be filming.

938
00:45:47,387 --> 00:45:48,513
- I'm not. I'm not.
- He's not.

939
00:45:48,889 --> 00:45:50,254
You're not even a pig.
You're a fuckin' rent-a-cop.

940
00:45:50,657 --> 00:45:52,124
- Trevor, shut the fuck up!
- Thank you.

941
00:45:52,493 --> 00:45:55,018
Listen to your fucking friend, for once in your life, will ya?

942
00:45:55,395 --> 00:45:56,726
- Sir, you don't need to...
- Aaaaaahhh!

943
00:45:58,665 --> 00:46:00,360
- What the fuck?
- What the hell was that?

944
00:46:02,336 --> 00:46:03,360
Alright.
Who else is with you?

945
00:46:03,737 --> 00:46:04,533
- There's no one else.
- Nobody, it's just us.

946
00:46:04,905 --> 00:46:06,532
Bullshit!
Who else is here?

947
00:46:06,907 --> 00:46:09,569
- Nobody's with us. That's what I'm...I'm sorry.
- There's something really weird going on in this building right now.

948
00:46:09,977 --> 00:46:10,841
I don't know what it is.

949
00:46:11,211 --> 00:46:12,303
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know...I...

950
00:46:12,679 --> 00:46:13,976
This place is fucking haunted.
Did you not notice that?

951
00:46:14,348 --> 00:46:19,980
Give me a break, will ya?
Now, all of you, stay here and don't fucking move.

952
00:46:20,354 --> 00:46:21,821
- Shhh.
- Sir, you really shouldn't go up there.

953
00:46:22,189 --> 00:46:24,714
Oh, gun's out.
The fucking cop guy's got his gun out.

954
00:46:25,092 --> 00:46:28,061
Hey, you want this right now?
Shut the fuck up and stay here!

955
00:46:32,866 --> 00:46:34,026
- Alex!
- What?

956
00:46:34,401 --> 00:46:36,164
- What?
- Alex, let's get the fuck out of here, man.

957
00:46:36,537 --> 00:46:37,902
- No, we can't leave, I already told you.
- Yes!

958
00:46:38,272 --> 00:46:39,261
If we leave now...

959
00:46:39,673 --> 00:46:42,301
Shhh!
If I leave, I'm the one who's in shit, time,

960
00:46:42,676 --> 00:46:44,200
and money for all those cameras.
There's like fifty grand worth of cameras up there.

961
00:46:44,578 --> 00:46:45,602
If you stay, you're going to be arrested.

962
00:46:46,013 --> 00:46:48,038
If you guys wanna leave, be my guest.
Go!

963
00:46:48,415 --> 00:46:50,246
I'm staying.
If I don't get the cameras and that footage back,

964
00:46:50,617 --> 00:46:53,245
I don't have a film, all right?
I won't have a fucking film!

965
00:46:53,921 --> 00:46:55,889
[gunfire] [screams] [gunfire]

966
00:46:57,357 --> 00:46:58,847
- Yo, were those gunshots?
- Yeah, they were.

967
00:46:59,226 --> 00:47:01,194
No, no, no. Alex, get down here.
Alex!

968
00:47:01,562 --> 00:47:03,257
Uh, Alex, dude, fuck it, man.
Please, let's just leave.

969
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:05,598
Look, why are we going towards the fucking gunshots?

970
00:47:05,966 --> 00:47:07,661
- He's an asshole!
- He's going by himself!

971
00:47:08,068 --> 00:47:08,727
Yo, let's go!

972
00:47:09,102 --> 00:47:10,228
C'mon.
Fuck! Fuck!

973
00:47:10,604 --> 00:47:11,536
Shhhh!

974
00:47:14,074 --> 00:47:15,006
Hello?

975
00:47:16,209 --> 00:47:17,198
You in here?

976
00:47:23,483 --> 00:47:24,472
Hey!

977
00:47:24,885 --> 00:47:27,251
Just let us stop.
Is that his fucking flashlight?

978
00:47:27,621 --> 00:47:28,781
Oh, my God!

979
00:47:29,156 --> 00:47:29,986
Shit!

980
00:47:32,993 --> 00:47:33,755
Hey!

981
00:47:34,761 --> 00:47:35,785
Hey, you okay?

982
00:47:40,434 --> 00:47:42,265
You gotta be fucking kidding me!

983
00:47:42,669 --> 00:47:44,432
- Where did he go?
- I don't fucking know.

984
00:47:44,805 --> 00:47:45,635
Seriously, I want to go.

985
00:47:46,006 --> 00:47:47,496
Yeah, I agree with her, man.
We gotta get out of here.

986
00:47:47,908 --> 00:47:48,772
Okay, I'm with you.
Hold on.

987
00:47:49,142 --> 00:47:51,303
Let's just split up into two groups.
It's gonna be faster that way.

988
00:47:51,678 --> 00:47:53,441
Are you fucking kidding me?
That's retarded Alex.

989
00:47:53,847 --> 00:47:55,474
- Why the fuck would we split up? That's so stupid.
- Just go fast.

990
00:47:55,849 --> 00:47:57,180
Tessa, if we do this together it's going to take forever.

991
00:47:57,584 --> 00:48:00,018
Yeah, fuck you!
Dude, I'm not walking around on my own in here, okay?

992
00:48:00,988 --> 00:48:02,455
- Man up. Go with Tessa.
- Man up?

993
00:48:02,823 --> 00:48:04,814
- Go get the cameras.
- When did you lose your brains?

994
00:48:05,192 --> 00:48:07,626
Why does this have to be a fucking argument all the time?
Why don't we just do one thing...

995
00:48:07,995 --> 00:48:08,484
Why does this have to...

996
00:48:09,196 --> 00:48:11,892
This is so fucking stupid.
I cannot believe we're doing this right now.

997
00:48:12,633 --> 00:48:13,930
Can you get that flashlight there?

998
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:17,997
- Can you please hurry up?
- Okay, come here.

999
00:48:25,545 --> 00:48:27,410
Hurry up. Hurry up.
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

1000
00:48:27,814 --> 00:48:29,008
Jen, Jen, calm down.

1001
00:48:34,121 --> 00:48:35,452
Tessa, I found the room.

1002
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:37,950
Jared, where are you?

1003
00:48:38,325 --> 00:48:39,690
Go to the end of the hall.

1004
00:48:40,727 --> 00:48:41,557
Where?

1005
00:48:45,999 --> 00:48:47,261
[Loud screech]

1006
00:48:50,203 --> 00:48:51,534
Oh, fuck!

1007
00:48:52,372 --> 00:48:53,498
Fuck!

1008
00:48:54,041 --> 00:48:54,871
Shit.

1009
00:49:00,747 --> 00:49:01,611
Tessa?

1010
00:49:02,849 --> 00:49:04,180
Tessa, get over here.

1011
00:49:06,687 --> 00:49:10,350
[Whispering]

1012
00:49:10,724 --> 00:49:11,383
What are you doing?

1013
00:49:12,092 --> 00:49:14,856
Oooooaaaaaahhhh!

1014
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,367
Jared, where are you?

1015
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:24,996
Oh my God! Jared!

1016
00:49:25,372 --> 00:49:26,134
Fuck!

1017
00:49:26,506 --> 00:49:27,336
Oh, shit!

1018
00:49:27,708 --> 00:49:29,198
Shit!
Shit!

1019
00:49:30,077 --> 00:49:31,738
You guys, you guys, I need help!

1020
00:49:32,746 --> 00:49:34,008
You guys, hello!

1021
00:49:34,715 --> 00:49:36,205
[air horn]

1022
00:49:37,784 --> 00:49:38,614
What the fuck happened?

1023
00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:40,987
- What happened, what happened?
- I don't know. I just heard a crash and he was gone.

1024
00:49:41,354 --> 00:49:42,719
- He must have fell.
- What?

1025
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:46,355
- Okay, what, what happened...
- I don't see anything..but let's 'sticks up' and fly.

1026
00:49:47,761 --> 00:49:48,955
Camera's rolling on everything.

1027
00:49:53,133 --> 00:49:54,930
Oooooaaaahhhh!!

1028
00:49:55,302 --> 00:49:57,099
Did you see that?
You fuckin' see that?

1029
00:49:57,871 --> 00:49:59,668
- Okay, no, no, no, no!
- Something threw him through the fucking window!

1030
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,008
- Let's get the fuck out of here. Let's go.
- Tess, we need to go. We need to go.

1031
00:50:02,609 --> 00:50:03,371
C'mon!

1032
00:50:04,377 --> 00:50:06,971
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1033
00:50:07,447 --> 00:50:09,039
Okay, an exit.
C'mon, it's an exit.

1034
00:50:10,717 --> 00:50:13,208
- Jenny, call 9-1-1.
- It's not working. I can't get a signal.

1035
00:50:13,587 --> 00:50:15,214
Keep moving. We'll call when we're outside. C'mon.

1036
00:50:15,589 --> 00:50:17,284
Fucking dead. Jared's fucking dead!

1037
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,121
- What?
- What the fuck? - No.

1038
00:50:22,996 --> 00:50:24,964
- This is supposed to lead to the front entrance.
- No, no, no, no.

1039
00:50:25,332 --> 00:50:28,358
That's impossible!
Look, look at the glow sticks.That's impossible!

1040
00:50:28,769 --> 00:50:30,293
Well, maybe the guard moved it, I mean...

1041
00:50:31,104 --> 00:50:33,436
- Why the fuck would the guard move it?
- I don't fucking know!

1042
00:50:34,274 --> 00:50:35,104
Haah.

1043
00:50:36,743 --> 00:50:38,074
Slow down!
Wait!

1044
00:50:38,445 --> 00:50:39,412
C'mon!

1045
00:50:40,447 --> 00:50:41,744
I'm getting the fuck outta here!

1046
00:50:44,918 --> 00:50:46,283
Uh, okay, okay, okay.

1047
00:50:46,653 --> 00:50:48,450
It says that we're right here,
so we just have to go down two flights of stairs

1048
00:50:48,822 --> 00:50:50,517
- ...and then in that direction.
- No, you're looking at it backwards.

1049
00:50:50,924 --> 00:50:52,118
The exits are that way.

1050
00:50:52,492 --> 00:50:54,619
Well, we're on the fourth fucking floor.
What the fuck are you talking about?

1051
00:50:54,995 --> 00:50:57,327
Alex, can you get over here, please?
Can you take a look at this?

1052
00:50:57,697 --> 00:51:00,564
- What's the point?
- So we can find a way to get out of here.

1053
00:51:01,434 --> 00:51:03,902
You still don't understand.
The map's fucking useless.

1054
00:51:04,371 --> 00:51:05,531
What are you talking a....

1055
00:51:09,643 --> 00:51:10,769
Is it this way?

1056
00:51:11,711 --> 00:51:13,542
Oh, my God, this place looks awfully dark.

Look.

1059
00:51:33,133 --> 00:51:34,725
They had a child's ward here?

1060
00:51:38,705 --> 00:51:39,865
Okay, let me go first.

1061
00:51:42,909 --> 00:51:45,537
- Oh, my God.
- They just leave this up here?

1062
00:51:47,581 --> 00:51:48,377
Fuck!

1063
00:51:48,748 --> 00:51:50,545
- You guys hear that?
- [music box]

Oh, my God.

Oh shit, you guys. Look!

You're seeing the impossible.

You getting this?

1069
00:52:08,435 --> 00:52:09,925
- Trevor, come back here.
- Trevor, get away from there.

1070
00:52:10,337 --> 00:52:11,599
Trevor, stop!

1071
00:52:15,575 --> 00:52:16,337
Oh shit!

1072
00:52:17,544 --> 00:52:18,875
Sweetie, what are you doing here?

1073
00:52:19,446 --> 00:52:20,208
Where are your parents?

00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:21,569
Hello.

I'm Caitlin.

What's your name?

01:03:55,942 --> 01:03:56,909
Get in!

1255
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,845
Hurry!
Hurry!

1256
01:04:09,722 --> 01:04:10,916
Trevor, you back there?

1257
01:04:13,326 --> 01:04:14,190
Turn it off...

1258
01:04:14,594 --> 01:04:15,356
Move!

1259
01:04:16,829 --> 01:04:17,796
Fuck!

1260
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:20,198
Guys, guys.
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

1261
01:04:20,566 --> 01:04:21,897
My fucking foot's caught!

1262
01:04:22,268 --> 01:04:23,292
Guys, don't...

1263
01:04:25,171 --> 01:04:26,138
What the fuck?

1264
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,304
....What the fuck?

1265
01:04:31,444 --> 01:04:32,411
Fuck me!

1266
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:38,739
Oh, fuck!

1267
01:04:39,952 --> 01:04:41,317
Ahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!

1268
01:04:41,687 --> 01:04:42,711
Trevor, Trevor!

1269
01:04:43,122 --> 01:04:44,953
Oh, my God, Trevor!
Where were you?

1270
01:04:45,324 --> 01:04:46,188
What happened?

1271
01:04:50,763 --> 01:04:52,355
What the fuck happened?
What happened?

1272
01:04:52,698 --> 01:04:53,892
I don't want to talk about it.

1273
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:55,294
Who are you?

1274
01:04:55,668 --> 01:04:57,761
Agh, agh!
Right, that means the changes are getting longer!

1275
01:04:58,137 --> 01:04:59,069
You been living in here?

1276
01:05:00,039 --> 01:05:05,409
First sixty-five. Minus one eight five.
Right there!

1277
01:05:06,812 --> 01:05:08,939
Ugh, ugh, ugh!

1278
01:05:09,815 --> 01:05:11,783
- Wait.
- Ugh, ugh!

1279
01:05:12,885 --> 01:05:14,011
You're Lance Preston.

1280
01:05:14,387 --> 01:05:15,877
Sean Rogerson, the actor, right?

1281
01:05:16,789 --> 01:05:18,882
You've been alive this whole time?

1282
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:23,494
Who's alive?!
Who's alive?

1283
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:25,720
[rat scurries]

1284
01:05:27,466 --> 01:05:30,401
[kissing sounds]

1285
01:05:31,337 --> 01:05:32,668
What's he doing?
What's he doing?

1286
01:05:37,410 --> 01:05:39,901
Hi buddy.
Are you my friend?

1287
01:05:40,312 --> 01:05:42,280
- Fuck!
- Hee, hee, hee, hee...

1288
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:46,681
Ah, gross!

1289
01:05:47,053 --> 01:05:49,021
Oh, oh, oh my God!

1290
01:05:49,689 --> 01:05:51,020
Ewww...I think I'm gonna be sick!

1291
01:05:54,827 --> 01:05:55,794
Want some?

1292
01:05:57,730 --> 01:06:00,563
You gotta help us find a way out of this goddamn building!

1293
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:02,294
Be patient.

1294
01:06:03,436 --> 01:06:04,869
- What?
- Patience?

1295
01:06:06,272 --> 01:06:07,239
Yeah.

1296
01:06:07,606 --> 01:06:08,436
What ward are you in?

1297
01:06:09,842 --> 01:06:12,936
Uh, Sean, we're not patients, okay.
We're film students.

1298
01:06:13,279 --> 01:06:14,473
We broke into the building.

1299
01:06:15,414 --> 01:06:16,244
Why?

1300
01:06:17,083 --> 01:06:18,050
Why would you do that?

1301
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:23,211
Because we needed to find the truth, okay,
about your film.

1302
01:06:23,789 --> 01:06:24,312
What?

1303
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:26,517
What film?
What film!?

1304
01:06:30,262 --> 01:06:32,924
- Good evening, and welcome to another episode...
- Sean!

1305
01:06:34,233 --> 01:06:36,497
This is the trailer for your movie
Grave Encounters.

1306
01:06:36,869 --> 01:06:37,665
Hah, hah, hah.

1307
01:06:38,037 --> 01:06:39,163
"...a dumping ground for embarrassing family
members rather than..."

1308
01:06:39,538 --> 01:06:40,505
Oh.

1309
01:06:43,409 --> 01:06:44,273
Ashley.

1310
01:06:46,112 --> 01:06:47,079
Fog came for her...

1311
01:06:48,547 --> 01:06:49,741
...took her away.

1312
01:06:50,716 --> 01:06:52,650
Shit, there must be a way out of here, right?

1313
01:06:52,985 --> 01:06:54,646
Anything.
You must know something.

1314
01:06:55,454 --> 01:06:56,546
Kenny's got the keys!

1315
01:06:56,922 --> 01:06:58,913
Kenny's got the keys!
Kenny's got the keys!

1316
01:06:59,291 --> 01:07:00,952
Kenny's got the keys!
Kenny's got the keys!

1317
01:07:01,327 --> 01:07:03,295
- Don't fuckin' touch me!
- Kenny's got the keys.

1318
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:06,054
He's gonna come for us.
Just wait a couple more days.

1319
01:07:06,432 --> 01:07:08,229
He's not going to come for us, Sean.
Listen to me.

1320
01:07:08,601 --> 01:07:11,126
He committed suicide years ago,
so he's not gonna come for you.

1321
01:07:11,804 --> 01:07:13,738
You must know something.
You've been in here for nine years.

1322
01:07:14,106 --> 01:07:16,404
An air duct, a fucking window.
Something!

1323
01:07:17,276 --> 01:07:19,904
Nine months, two days, eleven hours.

1324
01:07:20,846 --> 01:07:21,972
Nine months, two days, eleven hours.

1325
01:07:22,348 --> 01:07:24,145
He thinks he's only been here for nine months?

1326
01:07:24,617 --> 01:07:27,745
You've been here for nine years, not nine months,
do you understand?

1327
01:07:29,155 --> 01:07:30,986
Your mom, okay, I met your mom.

1328
01:07:31,357 --> 01:07:34,190
Lovely lady.
Lovely lady, but she's really ill, Sean.

1329
01:07:34,627 --> 01:07:36,595
- Your mom is very ill.
- Shut up! Shut up!

1330
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:43,131
Kenny's comin', Kenny's got the keys.

1331
01:07:53,279 --> 01:07:54,746
Trev, wake up!

1332
01:07:55,981 --> 01:07:59,348
- Alex, why are you filming this?
- This guy's completely out of his mind.

1333
01:07:59,718 --> 01:08:01,049
Look at him.
He's fucking psycho.

1334
01:08:02,555 --> 01:08:04,182
Ten years in this fucking place!

1335
01:08:05,324 --> 01:08:07,485
Why did you have to give him a pair of fucking scissors?

1336
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:09,725
He's not gonna do anything.
It's fine.

1337
01:08:14,633 --> 01:08:15,725
I don't trust him.

1338
01:08:20,639 --> 01:08:23,233
Sean, what are these drawings of?

1339
01:08:24,343 --> 01:08:26,038
Huh, huh, huh.

1340
01:08:28,347 --> 01:08:29,371
That's the door.

1341
01:08:34,153 --> 01:08:35,620
Huh, it's beautiful, isn't it?

1342
01:08:36,655 --> 01:08:38,020
This doesn't make any sense.

1343
01:08:38,924 --> 01:08:42,360
Yeah, you know what?
It doesn't fucking lead anywhere.

1344
01:08:42,761 --> 01:08:47,289
Sean, this is just a free-standing door.
Ye, ye, you go right through it.

1345
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:48,689
Maybe, maybe not.

1346
01:08:50,202 --> 01:08:54,662
But Sean's been through every single door in the building,
except this one.

1347
01:08:56,342 --> 01:08:58,310
This is the fucking way out, and you know that?

1348
01:08:59,678 --> 01:09:00,872
Lock, lock, locked!

1349
01:09:03,082 --> 01:09:04,379
It's too thick!

1350
01:09:04,783 --> 01:09:07,377
But the bolt-cutters, the bolt-cutters
could cut right through that.

1351
01:09:12,191 --> 01:09:14,386
You have...bolt-cutters?

1352
01:09:15,461 --> 01:09:18,760
Yeah, we have, we had a whole bag of tools,
but we, we lost it.

1353
01:09:20,566 --> 01:09:22,557
Where did you...you lose it?

1354
01:09:24,036 --> 01:09:25,060
The Building?

1355
01:09:25,871 --> 01:09:26,963
It's giant.

1356
01:09:27,373 --> 01:09:28,340
It's big!

1357
01:09:29,241 --> 01:09:30,208
As big as a city.

1358
01:09:30,576 --> 01:09:32,203
It's bigger, bigger, bigger.

1359
01:09:32,711 --> 01:09:34,008
Constantly shifts and changes.

1360
01:09:35,748 --> 01:09:37,079
But there are patterns.

1361
01:09:38,284 --> 01:09:39,273
I've mapped them.

1362
01:09:40,152 --> 01:09:41,346
Where did you leave the bag?

1363
01:09:42,655 --> 01:09:44,919
I don't know.
There was a...it was a, it was a hallway with...with...

1364
01:09:45,291 --> 01:09:47,486
there's, there's bathtubs in all the rooms.

1365
01:09:47,893 --> 01:09:48,917
Hydrotherapy room.

1366
01:09:50,629 --> 01:09:51,391
Here!

1367
01:09:53,232 --> 01:09:54,062
Four hours.

1368
01:09:54,767 --> 01:09:55,426
Six!

1369
01:09:56,568 --> 01:09:57,660
Seven, eight hours.

1370
01:09:58,003 --> 01:10:00,369
This is fucking crazy!
It's just a free-standing door.

1371
01:10:00,773 --> 01:10:03,207
It doesn't fucking lead anywhere.

1372
01:10:03,776 --> 01:10:05,437
- Alex, this isn't Narnia!
- N'yeah, okay.

1373
01:10:05,811 --> 01:10:08,336
I'm sorry, but this is really fucking crazy.
This is stupid.

1374
01:10:08,747 --> 01:10:09,611
You know what else is crazy?

1375
01:10:09,982 --> 01:10:12,678
Running through a hotel and ending up
in the same fucking place you started.

1376
01:10:13,419 --> 01:10:14,750
We've gotta avoid this area.

1377
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,087
What's, what's in that area?

1378
01:10:16,522 --> 01:10:19,184
- That's where Doctor Friedkin is
- Wait, Doctor Friedkin?

1379
01:10:19,591 --> 01:10:22,219
He was the head physician here.
I read about him online.

1380
01:10:22,594 --> 01:10:25,893
The rumour was that he was into the occult,
held rituals in the basement...

1381
01:10:26,999 --> 01:10:28,591
experiments on the patients.

1382
01:10:30,536 --> 01:10:31,833
Where do you think this came from?

1383
01:10:32,371 --> 01:10:34,339
That's where he went in.

1384
01:10:37,142 --> 01:10:37,836
[scream]

1385
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:42,669
He opened a gateway, you know.

1386
01:10:43,949 --> 01:10:45,211
Friedkin did.

1387
01:10:46,552 --> 01:10:49,817
He took the real world and the spirit world and...

1388
01:10:50,656 --> 01:10:52,021
he smashed them together.

1389
01:10:54,493 --> 01:10:58,020
Then he tore a hole in the building
and put...right through it.

1390
01:10:59,031 --> 01:11:02,057
That door is the only way out.

1391
01:11:02,868 --> 01:11:04,028
You have to believe me.

1392
01:11:09,808 --> 01:11:10,399
Alex, come on.

1393
01:11:10,743 --> 01:11:11,767
I can't believe we're doing this.

1394
01:11:12,177 --> 01:11:13,974
Why the fuck are we following him, Alex?

1395
01:11:14,413 --> 01:11:16,506
Dude, please, bad, I have a bad feeling about this guy.

1396
01:11:16,882 --> 01:11:18,907
- We don't have any other choice, all right?
- Alex.

1397
01:11:19,318 --> 01:11:20,478
Jesus!

1398
01:11:22,254 --> 01:11:23,118
What the fuck?

1399
01:11:23,522 --> 01:11:25,012
I thought you said you knew where you were going.

1400
01:11:25,391 --> 01:11:27,586
Just...hang on a second.
Move!

1401
01:11:29,495 --> 01:11:32,123
Come on, let's go, and don't wait here.

1402
01:11:36,201 --> 01:11:37,361
Fucking Christ!

1403
01:11:40,906 --> 01:11:41,930
We can just go.

1404
01:11:42,374 --> 01:11:43,500
Jeez, you're wasting our...

1405
01:11:46,111 --> 01:11:47,408
Ha, ha, ha.

1406
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:48,906
See, I told ya!

1407
01:11:50,082 --> 01:11:51,447
Jesus Christ!

1408
01:11:54,686 --> 01:11:55,675
What is that?

1409
01:11:56,889 --> 01:11:57,878
This way.
In here.

1410
01:11:58,257 --> 01:11:58,848
- Go!
- Okay, let's go.

1411
01:12:06,365 --> 01:12:08,959
You know that you're drinking out of a fuckin' toilet?

1412
01:12:22,981 --> 01:12:24,471
What the fuck are you doing?

1413
01:12:24,883 --> 01:12:26,646
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Jesus Christ!

1414
01:12:30,222 --> 01:12:31,712
Quit staring and help me!

1415
01:12:32,091 --> 01:12:33,388
It should be on the other side.

1416
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:36,817
[banging] [roaring]

1417
01:12:37,229 --> 01:12:38,821
Get the fuck out of the way!
I'm going through first!

1418
01:12:39,164 --> 01:12:40,153
Waaaahhhh!

1419
01:12:43,635 --> 01:12:44,624
Oh fuck!

1420
01:12:48,941 --> 01:12:49,965
You okay, man?

1421
01:12:50,776 --> 01:12:51,640
Trevor!

1422
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:53,136
That doesn't make any sense.

1423
01:12:53,512 --> 01:12:55,878
- Are you all right?
- Trevor, is the bag down there?

1424
01:12:56,515 --> 01:12:57,880
Yeah, the bag's here.

1425
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:02,580
What the fuck?

1426
01:13:05,290 --> 01:13:07,451
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Do you got me? - Yes.

1427
01:13:07,926 --> 01:13:09,393
- Okay.
- Careful, dude.

1428
01:13:11,964 --> 01:13:12,988
Got the bag?

1429
01:13:14,333 --> 01:13:15,698
Thank God.
Let me see those!

1430
01:13:17,636 --> 01:13:18,466
These might work.

1431
01:13:18,837 --> 01:13:20,270
Uh, okay, what do we do now?

1432
01:13:22,808 --> 01:13:24,105
We rest a few hours.

1433
01:13:25,611 --> 01:13:27,272
Then I see what's behind the door!

1434
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:28,847
What are you doing?

1435
01:13:28,847 --> 01:13:29,905
What are you doing?

1436
01:13:30,649 --> 01:13:32,241
Just in case something happens.

1437
01:13:39,525 --> 01:13:40,355
Lie down.

1438
01:14:52,364 --> 01:14:53,353
This is a bad idea.

1439
01:14:56,268 --> 01:14:57,599
Fuck you, Alex!

1440
01:14:57,970 --> 01:14:59,665
Fuck, you dragged us out?

1441
01:15:01,273 --> 01:15:02,262
Stupid!

1442
01:15:12,784 --> 01:15:26,255
Mom, Dad, Jason, if you guys are watching this,
it means I'm...probably dead.

1443
01:15:26,999 --> 01:15:31,197
So I guess this is my last will and testament.

1444
01:15:33,839 --> 01:15:35,864
You go to my room...
[loud noise]

1445
01:15:42,848 --> 01:15:44,873
[sobbing] Never should a been such a dick.

1446
01:15:46,118 --> 01:15:49,315
Okay, but I'm waking up and I'm here,

1447
01:15:49,688 --> 01:15:55,456
and recording a fucking will,
and I'm only 21 years old and don't want to fucking die.

1448
01:15:55,827 --> 01:15:57,795
I just want to go home.

1449
01:15:59,164 --> 01:16:01,132
I'm fucking so afraid.

1450
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:03,394
[loud bang]

1451
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:06,667
Hello?

1452
01:16:07,839 --> 01:16:09,033
Is anybody there?

1453
01:16:17,549 --> 01:16:18,573
Hello?

1454
01:16:23,021 --> 01:16:24,010
What the fuck?

1455
01:16:30,562 --> 01:16:31,358
Jesus!

1456
01:16:33,131 --> 01:16:35,395
Sean, you scared the shit out of me.
What do you want?

1457
01:16:35,867 --> 01:16:37,835
Woah, watch out!

1458
01:16:46,044 --> 01:16:48,569
No, no, no.

1459
01:16:55,253 --> 01:16:56,379
He made me do it.

1460
01:16:56,855 --> 01:16:58,550
He made me do it, I'm sorry.

1461
01:16:58,924 --> 01:17:00,414
I'm sorry.

1462
01:17:31,923 --> 01:17:32,947
You did this!

1463
01:17:40,232 --> 01:17:41,392
We just woke up.

1464
01:17:42,734 --> 01:17:45,066
Trevor's dead.
We found him in one of the bathrooms.

1465
01:17:54,813 --> 01:17:55,973
Sean did this.

1466
01:17:57,482 --> 01:17:59,746
Shoulda listened to Trevor.
I mean, he told me not to trust him.

1467
01:18:03,889 --> 01:18:06,016
Sean took all of our equipment.

1468
01:18:06,825 --> 01:18:12,092
The bolt-cutters, the water.
All he left us is this shitty fucking bag!

1469
01:18:12,431 --> 01:18:14,228
[sobbing] We're never gonna to get out of this building.

1470
01:18:14,599 --> 01:18:16,123
We're gonna die in here.

1471
01:18:16,501 --> 01:18:18,765
Listen to me, listen to me.
Calm down.

1472
01:18:19,337 --> 01:18:20,531
Stop filming me!

1473
01:18:20,939 --> 01:18:22,907
- Stop filming me!
- Shhh, Jennifer, shhh.

1474
01:18:23,408 --> 01:18:30,109
Now listen to me very carefully,
'cause I am not going to let anything happen to you.

1475
01:18:30,649 --> 01:18:31,581
Okay?

1476
01:18:32,117 --> 01:18:35,245
I'm not going to let anything happen to you.
We're gonna get out of here, I can promise you that.

1477
01:18:36,621 --> 01:18:37,588
How?

1478
01:18:39,991 --> 01:18:40,980
I don't know.

1479
01:18:45,597 --> 01:18:47,758
Wait!
Shh, wait.

1480
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:48,789
Where the fuck?

1481
01:18:49,167 --> 01:18:51,135
Fucking map, he left the fucking map.

1482
01:18:53,171 --> 01:18:53,967
Can you read it?

1483
01:18:55,474 --> 01:18:56,668
- Uhh.
- Can you read it?

1484
01:18:57,042 --> 01:18:58,839
- Yeah, yeah, I think so. I think so.
- Okay, this is what we're looking for.

1485
01:18:59,211 --> 01:19:01,679
We need to get to the room with the door before him.
We need the bolt-cutters.

1486
01:19:02,047 --> 01:19:03,674
That's our only chance of getting out of here, okay?

1487
01:19:10,856 --> 01:19:11,982
Are you sure it's that way?

1488
01:19:13,124 --> 01:19:14,386
This is good for something.

1489
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:17,087
It's been a long time since I've been on camera.

1490
01:19:18,230 --> 01:19:19,697
Might be a little...rusty.

1491
01:19:20,665 --> 01:19:22,189
Might be a little...rusty.
Hee, hee.

1492
01:19:23,168 --> 01:19:24,965
I'm...Lance Preston,

1493
01:19:25,337 --> 01:19:29,501
and welcome toanother episode of Grave Encounters,
hee, hee, hee, hee, ya.

1494
01:19:30,208 --> 01:19:33,041
Welcome to another episode of Grave, hee, hee, hee, hee.

1495
01:19:37,015 --> 01:19:38,004
I'm Lance Preston,

1496
01:19:38,383 --> 01:19:42,183
and welcome to another episode of Grave Encounters.

1497
01:19:42,721 --> 01:19:45,519
The rest of the cast is no longer with us,

1498
01:19:45,891 --> 01:19:47,984
but I...am still here.

1499
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:50,988
If we're lucky, maybe we can make contact with them.

1500
01:19:51,596 --> 01:19:53,427
Why'd you lock the door, Lance?

1501
01:19:53,832 --> 01:19:55,356
I want to go back to the hotel!

1502
01:19:55,734 --> 01:19:58,532
I'm sensing a dark and evil spirit.

1503
01:19:58,904 --> 01:19:59,734
Lance?

1504
01:20:00,205 --> 01:20:03,072
It even possibly might be a demon.

1505
01:20:04,009 --> 01:20:05,601
I'm done playing this character!

1506
01:20:09,548 --> 01:20:10,742
I'm getting out of here!

1507
01:20:11,116 --> 01:20:13,084
Which way's the room?
What's the right door?

1508
01:20:20,525 --> 01:20:21,457
[laughs]

1509
01:20:40,745 --> 01:20:41,609
Finally!

1510
01:20:50,488 --> 01:20:51,079
No.

1511
01:20:51,723 --> 01:20:52,587
Goddamn it!

1512
01:20:54,159 --> 01:20:54,989
What the fuck?

1513
01:20:58,330 --> 01:20:59,763
Nooooo!!!

1514
01:21:00,432 --> 01:21:01,558
Bullshit!
Bullshit!

1515
01:21:01,933 --> 01:21:03,798
Broken promises, myeaahhh!

1516
01:21:04,169 --> 01:21:05,136
Liar!!!!

1517
01:21:05,604 --> 01:21:07,299
Red door?
Bullshit!

1518
01:21:07,672 --> 01:21:08,639
Liar!

1519
01:21:20,452 --> 01:21:23,148
You said that one of us
could leave through the red door.

1520
01:21:24,155 --> 01:21:26,988
I even killed one of them so they wouldn't follow me.

1521
01:21:27,759 --> 01:21:28,919
What did I do wrong?

1522
01:21:29,294 --> 01:21:29,817
Huh?

1523
01:21:31,162 --> 01:21:32,254
Answer me!

1524
01:21:37,636 --> 01:21:40,605
How can I do that
if you won't let me leave?

1525
01:21:47,212 --> 01:21:48,179
Collect the tapes?

1526
01:21:48,546 --> 01:21:49,979
You want me to collect the footage?

1527
01:21:50,982 --> 01:21:51,505
Huh?

1528
01:21:51,883 --> 01:21:52,815
Yeah, I could do that.

1529
01:21:54,386 --> 01:21:55,216
I could try.

1530
01:21:55,620 --> 01:21:57,212
[loud bangs]

1531
01:22:04,496 --> 01:22:05,656
"Finish the film" What film?

1532
01:22:06,131 --> 01:22:07,655
What are you talking about?

1533
01:22:08,633 --> 01:22:09,463
Hello?

1534
01:22:11,069 --> 01:22:11,694
Okay.

1535
01:22:12,671 --> 01:22:13,638
Okay, all right.

1536
01:22:15,473 --> 01:22:16,235
Collect the tapes.

1537
01:22:17,909 --> 01:22:19,035
Collect the tapes.

1538
01:22:21,413 --> 01:22:22,175
The tapes.

1539
01:22:24,015 --> 01:22:25,676
The tapes.
Collect the tapes.

1540
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:36,322
You're sure it's this way?

1541
01:22:37,429 --> 01:22:39,056
The map says its just up ahead.

1542
01:22:39,931 --> 01:22:41,523
- Jennifer.
- This is it.

1543
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:45,936
Wait.
Sean told us to avoid the surgical ward.

1544
01:22:49,007 --> 01:22:50,975
I don't think we have any other choice.

1545
01:23:00,752 --> 01:23:01,684
What the hell are these things?

1546
01:23:10,295 --> 01:23:12,559
- When did Doctor Friedkin do this?
- Fuck!

1547
01:23:13,398 --> 01:23:14,695
What the fuckin' twisted...

1548
01:23:18,536 --> 01:23:19,525
Oh, my God.

1549
01:23:23,108 --> 01:23:25,474
Alex, this isn't right, we have to go,
we have to keep moving.

1550
01:23:26,578 --> 01:23:27,340
Alex, let's go.

1551
01:23:27,712 --> 01:23:29,407
Jennifer, we gotta get out of here.
[loud bang]

1552
01:23:34,285 --> 01:23:35,616
C'mon, c'mon, get in this.

1553
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:43,727
Turn the light off, turn the light off.

1554
01:23:44,429 --> 01:23:46,693
Shhh.
Keep you mouth shut, keep your mouth shut.

1555
01:23:47,832 --> 01:23:49,663
- Oh, my God.
- Be quiet!

1556
01:23:50,068 --> 01:23:51,228
Jennifer, be quiet.

1557
01:24:00,912 --> 01:24:01,844
Hold him down.

1558
01:24:15,994 --> 01:24:17,359
Is that Doctor Friedkin?

1559
01:24:17,962 --> 01:24:19,827
Don't do this, don't do this.

1560
01:24:20,365 --> 01:24:21,389
Jennifer, be quiet.

1561
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:22,789
Keep your mouth shut.

1562
01:24:27,272 --> 01:24:29,706
Ahhhhhh!!!!!!!!

1563
01:24:43,288 --> 01:24:45,256
[Baby crying]

1564
01:24:47,392 --> 01:24:48,256
A baby?

A fucking pentagram!

1566
01:25:05,877 --> 01:25:07,139
Fucking kidding me.

[bottles crashing on shelf]

- Shhhh!
- Shut the door, shut the door, shut the door!

1574
01:25:40,845 --> 01:25:42,870
- Okay, I think we're right here.
- I thought you said you could read this map.

1575
01:25:43,248 --> 01:25:45,079
- I am trying!
- You sure? Right here.

1576
01:25:45,450 --> 01:25:46,610
I don't fucking know!

1577
01:25:50,922 --> 01:25:54,551
- Oh shit, Jennifer, look.
- How the fuck did we get here?

1578
01:25:54,926 --> 01:25:56,723
How the fuck do we get anywhere
in this fucking place?

1579
01:25:58,196 --> 01:26:00,528
And it looks like he's already been here.
Did you think he went through?

1580
01:26:02,967 --> 01:26:03,956
Looks like it.

1581
01:26:05,370 --> 01:26:07,395
- We're too late.
- We're too late. He got out.

1582
01:26:07,772 --> 01:26:09,865
[laughter]

1583
01:26:11,876 --> 01:26:13,002
Oh, it doesn't work that way.

1584
01:26:13,544 --> 01:26:15,910
You killed Trevor, you fucking psycho!

1585
01:26:17,815 --> 01:26:22,149
Your friend was dead the moment he stepped foot
in the building.

1586
01:26:23,388 --> 01:26:24,480
You all were.

1587
01:26:27,926 --> 01:26:28,756
Alex, look at this.

1588
01:26:31,296 --> 01:26:35,630
It said...if one of us collected all the tapes
they could go.

1589
01:26:37,335 --> 01:26:38,324
And it's gonna be me.

1590
01:26:40,905 --> 01:26:43,032
Now you guys are gonna have to stay behind.

1591
01:26:44,242 --> 01:26:45,266
I'm sorry.

1592
01:26:46,644 --> 01:26:48,111
I've been in here way too long.

1593
01:26:50,448 --> 01:26:55,943
Do you have any idea what ten years in here
could do to a person?

1594
01:26:58,289 --> 01:26:59,449
I just want to go home.

1595
01:27:02,927 --> 01:27:05,088
Now give me the footage from your cameras.

1596
01:27:06,264 --> 01:27:07,731
I need to finish the film.

1597
01:27:09,133 --> 01:27:10,657
I'm not giving you anything.

1598
01:27:12,704 --> 01:27:14,035
This is my film.

1599
01:27:15,039 --> 01:27:18,031
The building said I need to finish the film!

1600
01:27:18,543 --> 01:27:20,511
- Now give me the footage!
- Waaaaahhh!

1601
01:27:23,114 --> 01:27:24,103
Give me the camera!

1602
01:27:24,615 --> 01:27:25,604
Give...

1603
01:27:38,963 --> 01:27:39,588
Get off him!

1604
01:27:39,964 --> 01:27:42,455
It's the only way, so fucking die already.

1605
01:27:45,203 --> 01:27:48,502
The building chose me, not you!

1606
01:27:49,841 --> 01:27:51,536
I need to finish the film!

1607
01:27:56,381 --> 01:27:57,313
Are you okay?

1608
01:27:57,882 --> 01:27:59,679
- You okay?
- I'm not sure--

1609
01:28:01,552 --> 01:28:02,712
You fucking bitch!

1610
01:28:03,855 --> 01:28:05,550
I'm gonna kill you.

1611
01:28:09,527 --> 01:28:10,551
What the fuck is that?

1612
01:28:34,552 --> 01:28:35,678
Alex, hang on!

1613
01:28:36,554 --> 01:28:37,578
Hang on!

1614
01:28:38,523 --> 01:28:39,547
- Alex!
- I can't!

1615
01:28:44,128 --> 01:28:46,619
I did what you said!
You liar!

1616
01:29:04,215 --> 01:29:05,182
Alex.

1617
01:29:07,418 --> 01:29:08,783
Alex, are you okay?

1618
01:29:12,123 --> 01:29:13,055
He's gone.

1619
01:29:13,791 --> 01:29:15,315
It just sucked him out.

1620
01:29:17,728 --> 01:29:18,888
What do we do now?

1621
01:29:30,007 --> 01:29:31,975
Just try to finish the film.

1622
01:29:34,579 --> 01:29:35,603
Finish the film.

1623
01:29:37,815 --> 01:29:40,682
This is what it's all been about, why it contacted me.

1624
01:29:43,788 --> 01:29:45,415
The building wants an audience.

1625
01:29:46,190 --> 01:29:47,782
Alex, what are you talking about?

1626
01:29:51,796 --> 01:29:53,957
I think I just figured out the ending of my movie.

1627
01:29:58,503 --> 01:29:59,435
You're the star.

1628
01:30:04,609 --> 01:30:05,871
Alex, what are you doing?

1629
01:30:07,311 --> 01:30:08,243
You heard him.

1630
01:30:09,814 --> 01:30:12,783
Only one of us is getting out, so what d'ya say, Jennifer?

1631
01:30:14,118 --> 01:30:18,919
You always told me you wanted your death scene
to be...epic, right?

1632
01:30:20,558 --> 01:30:23,527
This is it.
I mean, don't make this harder than it has to be.

1633
01:30:25,630 --> 01:30:27,825
Alex, please.

1634
01:30:31,536 --> 01:30:32,366
I'm sorry.

1635
01:30:33,237 --> 01:30:34,602
So sorry!

1636
01:30:35,039 --> 01:30:36,165
Should have fucking made it.

1637
01:30:36,707 --> 01:30:38,868
I'm so sorry, I mean, I really, really am.

1638
01:30:39,243 --> 01:30:40,107
Alex, stop!

1639
01:30:40,511 --> 01:30:41,876
I'm sorry.

1640
01:30:45,883 --> 01:30:48,579
Alex, Nooooo!!!

1641
01:30:57,662 --> 01:30:58,594
It's over.

1642
01:31:00,665 --> 01:31:01,689
Go to sleep.

1643
01:31:08,773 --> 01:31:09,637
I'll do it.

1644
01:31:11,209 --> 01:31:12,699
I'll finish your film.

1645
01:31:13,377 --> 01:31:15,140
Others will see it.
They'll come.

1646
01:31:18,849 --> 01:31:20,180
I won't let you down.

1647
01:32:01,125 --> 01:32:04,458
[laughs]

1648
01:32:14,338 --> 01:32:21,107
[Siren wailing]

1649
01:32:33,357 --> 01:32:34,187
Sir!

1650
01:32:34,592 --> 01:32:36,719
Got a report that you wandered across the I-5.

1651
01:32:39,630 --> 01:32:44,431
Seven-eight-twenty-three, we got a Caucasian male,
large duffle bag, requesting backup.

1652
01:32:44,935 --> 01:32:45,458
Sir!

1653
01:32:46,504 --> 01:32:47,266
Sir!

1654
01:32:48,139 --> 01:32:49,231
No, no, my cameras!

1655
01:32:49,674 --> 01:32:51,505
I need my footage.
I'm not going back, uggghhh.

1656
01:32:52,543 --> 01:32:54,033
I need my cameras!

1657
01:32:55,980 --> 01:32:56,742
Where am I?

1658
01:32:57,682 --> 01:32:58,979
- Where am I?
- Huh?

1659
01:33:00,184 --> 01:33:01,344
What city am I in?

1660
01:33:01,952 --> 01:33:03,214
You're in Los Angeles.

1661
01:33:13,864 --> 01:33:17,391
So, Gerry, can you tell us how Grave Encounters 2
came together?

1662
01:33:18,069 --> 01:33:18,660
Well, sure.

1663
01:33:19,170 --> 01:33:23,630
I mean, look, I was just as surprised as anybody
when this kid comes walking into my office to tell me

1664
01:33:24,008 --> 01:33:25,942
that he's just filmed the sequel to Grave Encounters.

1665
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:32,408
I mean, I thought he was nuts, ya know, but, uh,
as it turns out, Alex here is quite a talented director

1666
01:33:32,750 --> 01:33:34,741
and, uh, I really think that he's got
a bright future ahead of him.

1667
01:33:35,152 --> 01:33:36,619
And this thing has got everything.

1668
01:33:36,987 --> 01:33:41,947
Ya know, its got ghosts sending messages
through the Internet, uh, young girls being killed,

1669
01:33:42,326 --> 01:33:45,784
guys being sucked through walls.
It's...wild stuff!

1670
01:33:46,263 --> 01:33:47,230
Hopefully, you enjoyed it.

1671
01:33:48,666 --> 01:33:53,467
But, I...I want to be very clear about one thing,
as I made this mistake with the first film.

1672
01:33:54,205 --> 01:33:57,299
Everything you've just seen...is fake, okay?

1673
01:33:57,675 --> 01:34:00,838
Every single shot has been, uh, doctored or manipulated.

1674
01:34:02,012 --> 01:34:03,138
It's just a movie.

1675
01:34:04,448 --> 01:34:06,973
Is there anything you want to add before we wrap all this up?

1676
01:34:08,386 --> 01:34:10,980
Look, whatever you do, don't go looking for the building.

1677
01:34:11,355 --> 01:34:14,324
All right? Don't go looking for (CENSORED).
It's not worth it.

1678
01:34:15,693 --> 01:34:16,682
There's nothing there.

1679
01:38:17,534 --> 01:38:18,728
Random question

1680
01:38:19,303 --> 01:38:20,463
- Yeah.
- Are you ready?

1681
01:38:21,305 --> 01:38:23,603
- 'kay, I'm ready.
- Okay, you were at the Halloween party.

1682
01:38:24,041 --> 01:38:29,035
- Yeah.
- I was, like, throwing myself at Alex like...

1683
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:31,641
- Yeah.
- ...like if I was another person, and I saw me,

1684
01:38:32,016 --> 01:38:33,984
I would be like, that girl's a slut.

1685
01:38:34,652 --> 01:38:37,678
Just like...nothing from him, like, absolutely nothing.

1686
01:38:38,322 --> 01:38:42,952
I've been trying for months now
and he just can't take a hint.

1687
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:45,824
Alex is pretty shy though.
He's always been a pretty shy guy.

1688
01:38:46,296 --> 01:38:50,130
Yeah, but he wouldn't have to do anything outgoing
at this point.

1689
01:38:50,501 --> 01:38:52,298
Why the fuck do you think I'm here right now?

1690
01:38:53,037 --> 01:38:56,006
- You're not filming this, are you?
- No, I'm not filming this.

1691
01:38:56,473 --> 01:38:59,636
- Are you fil...
- Oh shit! - I think you are filming It's going.

1692
01:39:00,010 --> 01:39:00,840
Oh fuck!
