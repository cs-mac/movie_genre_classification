1
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,052
Which one?
Number 1 or number 2?

2
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,859
Which one?

3
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,057
Go ahead! Which one?

4
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,620
Smells sweet....

5
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,019
just like cream.

6
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,698
No, please...

7
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,738
Please!

8
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,573
Should I spare him?

9
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,092
Would you die for him?

10
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,448
On your chin...

11
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,137
The other side...

12
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,654
That OK?

13
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,818
Yes.

14
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,218
Why did the boss call you yesterday?

15
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,700
The boss of Minato Kosan
called to ask how I'm doing.

16
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,134
He wanted me to recommend some
people to him.

17
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,500
Recommend?

18
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,331
I refused!

19
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,613
Oh... I understand.

20
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,099
Um, well... one question...

21
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,978
Forget about it...

22
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,448
What? Ask any questions you like.

23
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,539
Well ...

24
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,213
I was wondering whether
you have a boyfriend or not?

25
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,373
Oh...

26
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,016
No, I don't.

27
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,700
And what about you?

28
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,655
Pardon?

29
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,210
Do you have a girlfriend?

30
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,496
Oh, no. No, I don't.

31
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,932
I like you.

32
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:54,292
Love at first sight!

33
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,296
Will you go out with me?

34
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:07,140
You are not unsympathetic to me.
That`s why I am here.

35
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,340
- So?
- That`s not the point...

36
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:13,618
But... this is a bit sudden.

37
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:22,692
I'm referring to the fact it`s
only our first date.

38
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,893
I`m not sure...

39
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,889
Please understand me... maybe we 
should get to know each other better first.

40
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,900
Yes... Of course...

41
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,811
You're right.

42
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,452
That's a tall order
on the first date...

43
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,773
Yes...

44
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,058
Did you enjoy yourself?

45
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,093
Yes.

46
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,778
Great!

47
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,420
I thought that you didn't like it.

48
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,172
No, I also found it very beautiful.

49
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,251
Really? 
I'm relieved to hear that.

50
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,458
Mr. Koijima...

51
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:13,216
Would you die for me?
- Eh?

52
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,297
Would you... die for me?

53
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,018
I'm just kidding.

54
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,418
Let`s go.

55
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,852
When the crunch comes,
I will do my best.

56
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,610
What a delicious cake!

57
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:28,333
The cream is excellent.
Simply excellent.

58
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:35,333
A really exciting
taste experience!

59
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,898
I have a question.

60
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,815
How many times did you have sex?

61
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,218
Listen to me, dude!

62
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,658
More than a hundred times?

63
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,139
Fifty?

64
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,692
Now you!

65
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,893
More than ten times?

66
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,973
At least once?

67
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,499
Not a single time?

68
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,330
Really? Did you just meet?

69
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,093
Hey!

70
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,412
Do you like him?

71
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,814
You!

72
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,458
Do you like her?

73
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,373
I see...

74
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,210
Would you die for her?

75
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,408
You will both die here anyway.

76
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,379
But there is a loophole.

77
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,890
You must excite me sexually,

78
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,458
turn me on.

79
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:14,257
Excite me with your will to survive.

80
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,298
Then I'll let you go.

81
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,059
I give you my word!

82
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,409
Let's get right into it.

83
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,013
Look at me!

84
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,729
This is a command!

85
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,689
Open your eyes.

86
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,653
You must look at him!

87
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,858
And you look over here!

88
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,533
Don`t move!

89
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,254
Calm down...

90
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,328
Calm down!

91
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,168
Breathe out slowly.

92
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,132
Breathe in...

93
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,011
Breathe out...

94
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,212
Breathe in...

95
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,496
Breathe out...

96
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,613
I will be nice to you. 
Relax. 

97
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,093
Be a good boy now!

98
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,179
Is it tight enough?

99
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,336
Hey you! Look at him!

100
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,216
Slowly...

101
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,298
That`s enough.

102
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,575
Only talk if I ask you something.

103
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:59,693
If you can endure it, 
I won`t gag you.

104
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,893
Do you think you can endure it?

105
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,534
Yes.

106
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,334
Okay...

107
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,693
You`re still soaking.

108
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,412
Say: "Please kill me!"

109
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,932
Go ahead!

110
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,928
It's just words.

111
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,531
"Please kill me!"

112
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,811
"Please kill me!"

113
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,490
"Please kill me!"

114
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,613
"Please kill..."
- No!

115
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,494
Only talk if I ask you something.

116
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,858
If you can endure it, 
I won't gag you.

117
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,859
You think you can endure it?

118
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,899
Yes.

119
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,460
Now the real pain begins.

120
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,497
Try your best to excite me.

121
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,451
Please... Why?

122
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,775
Let us go...

123
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,215
We will not reveal anything.

124
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,896
Let her go at least.

125
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,769
No!

126
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,778
A gift from him.

127
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,259
It looks good on you.

128
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,769
You should give him a gift, too.

129
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,249
No... please!

130
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,331
I did not ask you a question.

131
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,730
Now, I must punish you.

132
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,130
Stay still, otherwise I'll cut too deep.

133
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,130
No!

134
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,095
I have treated the wounds.

135
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,692
And now a gift from her.

136
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,094
What a nice finger...

137
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,090
Right?

138
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,856
I'll kill you!

139
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:12,316
You would die for her... right?

140
00:39:14,875 --> 00:39:17,299
But first I will torture you.

141
00:39:18,076 --> 00:39:20,626
I will cut you into pieces.

142
00:39:22,667 --> 00:39:24,900
If you break down, she`s next in line.

143
00:39:25,108 --> 00:39:29,572
Be brave and I will spare her.
You agree with the rules of the game?

144
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:58,571
First, I will hammer some nails
into your nuts.

145
00:40:02,947 --> 00:40:07,299
If you surrender, I`ll stop your 
torture and start torturing her... 

146
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:19,133
The nail will go in exactly here...

147
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:22,295
It will be very painful.

148
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,689
To surrender is not a disgrace.

149
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:32,335
You said you would die for her...

150
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:37,293
But the human being is
weak. That's okay.

151
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:41,332
Therefore, will you give up? 

152
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:02,088
Crumpled poor little thing...

153
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,212
And now for your penis...

154
00:41:33,368 --> 00:41:38,941
I will cut it off.
You'll never have sex again.

155
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,700
Not even with her.

156
00:41:42,445 --> 00:41:43,729
So?

157
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:57,073
First, I'll have a look at that
eye of yours.

158
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,729
Please, no...

159
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,978
And now your penis...

160
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,196
No...
- Eh?

161
00:42:31,868 --> 00:42:33,762
Who has allowed you to speak?

162
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:43,929
Should I quit?

163
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,578
Put yourself in his place.

164
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,896
I`ve deeply felt...

165
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,734
The sexual stimulation!

166
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,253
You`ve won!

167
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,093
I`ll not let you die.

168
00:43:58,324 --> 00:43:59,333
Miss Miyashita...

169
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:11,780
Well...

170
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:15,455
I'm glad that
we are still alive.

171
00:44:19,052 --> 00:44:21,139
Were you ready to die?

172
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,176
I was in mortal fear.

173
00:44:27,952 --> 00:44:33,809
But... I did my best...
as promised.

174
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:41,049
Anyway, we suvived.
You and me...

175
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:43,613
Yes...

176
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:48,650
Both of us... together.

177
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,452
How are you?

178
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,460
You're both still too weak.

179
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:11,133
You can stay until you have 
recovered.

180
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:15,094
This is my way of saying
thanks for the thrill of excitement.

181
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:19,091
Why should we trust you?

182
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:23,051
Stop bothering us!
- Relax.

183
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:27,460
Of course you don`t trust me,

184
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:30,372
after what I`ve done to you.

185
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:35,700
I will do my best
to convince you.

186
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,772
I hope you understand my feelings.

187
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:42,977
That`s so selfish!

188
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,610
- Skip it, please...
- Oh, that`s OK...

189
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:49,692
However, I am selfish.

190
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:55,450
I have a selfish
desire to serve you.

191
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:05,158
Nevertheless, I insist
that you wear these chains... 

192
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:15,620
Why have you shackled us? 

193
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:18,976
So you don't try to escape.
It`s dangerous. You need rest.

194
00:46:19,591 --> 00:46:23,194
I am a good doctor...
When you've recovered,

195
00:46:23,695 --> 00:46:25,572
I`ll take you to the police.

196
00:46:26,613 --> 00:46:27,409
Yeah...

197
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,022
I'll give myself up to the police.

198
00:46:32,273 --> 00:46:39,913
You'll get all my assets...
a 700 million yen injury award. 

199
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:45,894
Compared with the excitement that you
gave me, it's nothing.

200
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:04,579
Delicious...

201
00:47:11,114 --> 00:47:13,796
Tell me...
- Yes?

202
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:19,218
Isn`t it a little odd...

203
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:21,772
...that he's treating us so well?

204
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,697
What's his plan?

205
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,296
What`s going on in his head?

206
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:37,578
Maybe he really will let us go free,
as he said.

207
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,533
Who knows...?

208
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:43,858
Let's hope so...

209
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:47,420
He's still mad!

210
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:52,130
Even if he's telling the truth,
he's still a pathological sadist.

211
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:57,170
We must keep our eyes open!

212
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,979
I thought... if we get out of here...

213
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:11,337
I know... I am
a cripple now, but ...

214
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:14,216
If we get out of here...

215
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:18,133
I would stay with you, if you`d like. 

216
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:24,093
Thanks!

217
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:28,410
I'm also a broken man...

218
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:33,133
but together we form a unit!

219
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:39,730
I'd like you by my side. 

220
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,691
I will do my best.

221
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,572
By the way:
I have to go to the bathroom!

222
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:02,532
It's never more than
30 seconds until he is here.

223
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,492
You're right.

224
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:11,654
And this other thing...
it really cracks me up...

225
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:15,058
Yeah, me too!

226
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,820
I wonder if he even noticed.

227
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:21,940
If so, he would have done 
something about it.

228
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:24,579
I do believe that
he bathes regularly.

229
00:49:26,793 --> 00:49:30,480
He smells a little like
soap and shampoo.

230
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:39,654
Have you guys finished?

231
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,403
I need to go to the bathroom.

232
00:49:44,658 --> 00:49:45,954
OK.

233
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:05,453
I`m sorry...

234
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:45,176
You all right?
- Alrighty!

235
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:51,014
I am fine.

236
00:50:53,327 --> 00:50:55,254
What perseverance!

237
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:59,092
Your will to live is admirable!

238
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:02,532
It will soon be over.

239
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:07,095
Shall we go?
- Of course.

240
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,616
I`m really so satisfied.

241
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,980
If you both feel better,

242
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:14,414
you`ll be free in two or three days. 

243
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,816
And now, take your medication.

244
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:20,133
What does that mean?

245
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,329
No!

246
00:52:22,829 --> 00:52:23,973
What is going on here?

247
00:52:26,958 --> 00:52:28,910
Shut up and relax!

248
00:52:30,316 --> 00:52:32,244
You`ve really excited me,

249
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:37,451
therefore I want to taste a
little more of it.

250
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:44,168
That you're back here now... 
must make you feel a deep despair. 

251
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:49,485
And now, 
show me your survival will again.

252
00:52:50,791 --> 00:52:55,247
You've got what it takes...
I`m sure.

253
00:52:59,466 --> 00:53:01,589
I don`t break my promises,

254
00:53:02,187 --> 00:53:05,973
but I was not excited enough to release 
you guys.

255
00:53:09,225 --> 00:53:13,306
Now you can prove that you're 
ready to die for her. 

256
00:53:28,254 --> 00:53:33,477
I`ll make a clean cut and 
pull out your rectum.

257
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:39,585
I'll cut in the vicinity of your
anus, where the bowel ends.

258
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:43,933
Then I'll hook the intestinal end on here.

259
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:49,580
Once your guts are hanging out...

260
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:53,368
you can go straight up to her.

261
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:12,178
Here is a pair of scissors.

262
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:17,736
Your guts only reach to here,

263
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:23,179
so you'll have to cut it,

264
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:26,336
remove her manacles...

265
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,892
and release her.

266
00:54:32,318 --> 00:54:34,877
If you can make it,
I'll let her go.

267
00:54:35,317 --> 00:54:38,410
But your life is probably over...
Maybe!

268
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:42,057
So what? It's romantic, right?

269
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:59,898
Make me horny!
I know you can!

270
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:03,256
What's with this look?!

271
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:07,694
Her life is in your hands.

272
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:09,894
Be strong and brave!

273
00:55:34,054 --> 00:55:35,122
Here... good...

274
00:56:34,757 --> 00:56:37,940
Should I torture her, and
cut her into pieces? 

275
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:43,135
I thought you would do it.

276
00:56:44,095 --> 00:56:46,532
Was I really all wrong about you, huh?

277
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:20,503
Good... good...
you can do it!

278
00:57:21,197 --> 00:57:21,504
You can do it!

279
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,732
You can perform miracles!

280
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:26,700
Go ahead!

281
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:28,292
Go! Go!

282
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:46,493
Hey!

283
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:50,976
Hey!

284
00:58:25,984 --> 00:58:27,320
Good... good...

285
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:31,297
A few more steps!
Keep it up! Go on!

286
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:36,060
You have almost reached the scissors.
Go on! Keep it up! Good!

287
00:58:34,776 --> 00:58:38,964
Go ahead!
You're almost there!

288
00:58:40,024 --> 00:58:41,064
A tiny weeny bit more!

289
00:58:41,887 --> 00:58:42,993
Go!

290
00:58:43,363 --> 00:58:45,168
Try harder!
Yeah...

291
00:58:45,514 --> 00:58:48,442
Good... almost there.

292
00:58:51,366 --> 00:58:52,582
C'mon!

293
00:59:15,104 --> 00:59:18,822
You can perform miracles.
You can do it! Yeah!

294
00:59:20,522 --> 00:59:22,813
Now! Do it!

295
00:59:24,194 --> 00:59:26,921
A bit more!
Yes! Yes!

296
00:59:27,562 --> 00:59:31,762
You're doing it! Good... go ahead!!

297
00:59:32,382 --> 00:59:36,613
Go... go... go!

298
00:59:37,114 --> 00:59:40,965
C`mon, it`s not so far...

299
00:59:42,575 --> 00:59:45,712
Go ahead!
Just a few more centimeters!

300
00:59:49,096 --> 00:59:53,640
Rescue her! Rescue her!
You can do it!

301
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:02,317
Right there!

302
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:07,964
You can do it! Good!
I know you can do it!

303
01:00:08,956 --> 01:00:15,497
Yeah, do it! Right!
Buck up! You did it!

304
01:00:19,102 --> 01:00:21,634
Get a grip!
Go on!

305
01:00:44,857 --> 01:00:47,056
Stand up!

306
01:01:00,755 --> 01:01:07,263
Intersect it! 
Yeah, you can do it!

307
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:09,031
Go! Hurry up!

308
01:01:17,167 --> 01:01:23,295
Hurry up! Play up!
Try harder!

309
01:01:37,348 --> 01:01:38,244
Wire.

310
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:41,211
It`s OK: you can cut through.

311
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:17,418
Was that it?

312
01:02:18,537 --> 01:02:20,488
A futile attempt.

313
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:11,692
Show me one last
time your will to live.

314
01:03:19,705 --> 01:03:20,544
Hey.

315
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:36,131
Yes. That is the correct look.

316
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:06,770
I was with your mother.

317
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:11,860
She`s a prostitute in Okubo.

318
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:15,904
A fat whore, with
tons of make-up on her face.

319
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:18,739
A virus-contaminated sheep!

320
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:23,376
I was with her.

321
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:27,368
You look exactly like her.

322
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:30,412
And you have this thing, too.

323
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:32,448
Thing?

324
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:35,529
What thing?

325
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:38,852
You don't even know?

326
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:42,773
Tell me.

327
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:48,016
You really don't know?

328
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:50,538
I`m sorry for you!

329
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:55,779
You never had many friends, right?
Am I right?

330
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:03,011
Above all, girls have always
shunned you.

331
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:10,215
And only whores like your mother 
wanted to have sex with you.

332
01:05:13,105 --> 01:05:15,771
You were never loved 
by a woman, right?

333
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:18,413
Do you know why?

334
01:05:19,782 --> 01:05:21,892
Do you want me to tell you?

335
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:28,132
It is hereditary. 
The genes of your whore-mother.

336
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:35,691
The prostitute from
Okubo stank like a skunk.

337
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:41,131
Therefore even drunks didn't want to
go to bed with her.

338
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:47,389
If she hasn`t told you,
she knew it would not tell itself.

339
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:52,779
Shit happens, son of a bitch!

340
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:56,418
I stink?

341
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:04,692
You and your whore-mother.

342
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:07,215
You spread a
terrible stench.

343
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:09,852
Your armpits stink.

344
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:12,374
Stench...

345
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:17,370
You cannot smell -
am I right?

346
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:20,092
This lack of the sense of smell...

347
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:23,891
is what you have also inherited.

348
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:30,615
You stink horribly and
you can`t even smell it.

349
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:34,428
There are people like you.

350
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:40,900
You stink. That`s the reason why 
everybody gets out of your way.

351
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:47,898
If somebody really
loved you, they would have told you.

352
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:55,209
If nobody ever said it to you, that means
that no one has ever loved you.

353
01:06:55,980 --> 01:07:00,417
You make these insane
things because you're so lonely.

354
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,373
Am I right?

355
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:08,536
I am so sorry for you!

356
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:12,217
Poor devil. You're lonely...
