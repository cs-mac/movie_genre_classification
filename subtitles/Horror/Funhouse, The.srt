1
00:00:55,732 --> 00:00:57,817
Little late for visitors.

2
00:01:00,737 --> 00:01:04,658
I apologize. I had an appointment
with Warden Kane hours ago.

3
00:01:04,825 --> 00:01:06,826
Traffic was murderous.

4
00:01:06,993 --> 00:01:08,912
You can have an appointment with me, darling.

5
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:10,455
Hello, Miss Quinn.

6
00:01:10,622 --> 00:01:13,917
Uh, please,
excuse my guard's lack of manners.

7
00:01:14,084 --> 00:01:16,586
Around these parts,
we don't get a lot of reporters

8
00:01:16,753 --> 00:01:20,840
that look like... uh, please, come in.

9
00:01:29,641 --> 00:01:32,102
We're already drawing enough heat down here.

10
00:01:32,268 --> 00:01:36,523
And you want to go make things worse
by sexually harassing a journalist?

11
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:39,901
Once everybody knows about this place,
we'll probably all get shitcanned.

12
00:01:40,068 --> 00:01:41,169
Who cares?

13
00:01:58,878 --> 00:02:00,421
You boys okay?

14
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:01,982
Is there a problem?

15
00:02:02,132 --> 00:02:04,759
Uh, no, no. No problem at all.

16
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:09,097
- I don't bite.
- Right. Yes.

17
00:02:09,264 --> 00:02:11,449
Uh, well, uh...

18
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,934
Shall we get started?

19
00:02:13,101 --> 00:02:16,454
Of course. Do you mind if I record this?

20
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:19,232
No, certainly not. Go right ahead.

21
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:21,459
I want everything to be by the book.

22
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:24,237
Uh, before we get started,

23
00:02:24,404 --> 00:02:28,867
has anyone warned you about this place?

24
00:02:30,743 --> 00:02:32,370
I don't scare easily, Mr. Kane.

25
00:02:32,537 --> 00:02:34,038
But thank you for your concern.

26
00:02:34,205 --> 00:02:37,584
Ah. Well, Miss, there are people here

27
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,836
that even God is afraid of.

28
00:02:52,515 --> 00:02:54,934
I'm amazed you've been able
to keep a facility such as this

29
00:02:55,101 --> 00:02:56,644
hidden for so long.

30
00:02:56,811 --> 00:02:59,189
Well, most of the jobs
left this area years ago,

31
00:02:59,355 --> 00:03:03,484
so there's not much reason for people
to venture down here any longer.

32
00:03:03,693 --> 00:03:06,321
Although we do get the occasional
teenage devil worshippers,

33
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:08,948
but they're pretty easy to scare off.

34
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:14,746
On the record, why the secrecy?

35
00:03:15,955 --> 00:03:19,292
Other facilities for
the criminally insane exist.

36
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:21,394
They don't hold people without trial.

37
00:03:21,544 --> 00:03:23,229
What about their rights?

38
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:28,092
Well, if Gitmo can get away
with it, why shouldn't we?

39
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:33,306
These monsters, they're domestic terrorists.

40
00:03:33,473 --> 00:03:36,142
As far as I'm concerned, they have no rights.

41
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:38,770
I mean, do you really believe

42
00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:41,856
that out of the millions of
people in this country,

43
00:03:42,065 --> 00:03:45,818
there aren't more than just
a handful of sickos, hmm?

44
00:03:45,985 --> 00:03:50,365
I mean, Dahmer and Bundy and Gacy,

45
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:53,218
they're just the ones that got all the press.

46
00:03:53,368 --> 00:03:55,745
Here, we house the ones

47
00:03:55,912 --> 00:03:59,582
that you whisper about around the campfire.

48
00:03:59,749 --> 00:04:01,834
So killing them.

49
00:04:02,043 --> 00:04:03,461
Would that be the answer?

50
00:04:03,628 --> 00:04:05,088
Off the record?

51
00:04:09,634 --> 00:04:12,762
If I didn't have those
SOBs up in the state house

52
00:04:12,929 --> 00:04:15,848
nosing around my business,

53
00:04:16,015 --> 00:04:20,103
I'd put a bullet in each of their heads.

54
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:27,735
Welcome to no man's land, Miss Quinn.

55
00:04:34,117 --> 00:04:39,664
This... This is what we call Supermax.

56
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:50,258
That is Jeffrey Ramseys.

57
00:04:50,508 --> 00:04:54,804
Affectionately called Animal the Cannibal.

58
00:05:00,143 --> 00:05:02,937
Probably heard the rumor of the famous chef

59
00:05:03,104 --> 00:05:06,441
whose flank steak was to die for.

60
00:05:10,236 --> 00:05:13,823
Turns out he was serving
customers to customers.

61
00:05:25,043 --> 00:05:27,420
The, uh, scar,

62
00:05:27,587 --> 00:05:29,422
it's from one meal who fought back.

63
00:05:47,607 --> 00:05:50,568
His board of directors
from the restaurant chain

64
00:05:50,735 --> 00:05:53,755
decided it might be bad for
business if people found out

65
00:05:53,905 --> 00:05:56,657
he was literally serving people, so,

66
00:05:56,824 --> 00:06:01,662
they arranged for Animal here to disappear.

67
00:06:04,165 --> 00:06:06,501
Then there's Bradford Young.

68
00:06:10,338 --> 00:06:14,175
Ladies nicknamed him Dr. Suave.

69
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:23,976
He was a dentist who believed that
not every tooth could be saved.

70
00:06:26,938 --> 00:06:29,440
We'll get that toothache to stop.

71
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:31,234
Don't you worry.

72
00:06:34,987 --> 00:06:38,032
Just relax. It's all gonna be fine.

73
00:06:52,755 --> 00:06:54,465
That should do it.

74
00:06:58,803 --> 00:07:00,304
No, no, no.

75
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,564
Who's this handsome fella?

76
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,233
Ah, that's Walter Harris,

77
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,694
A.K.A. The Taxidermist.

78
00:07:15,695 --> 00:07:19,615
His specialty was birds.
The more exotic, the better.

79
00:07:31,294 --> 00:07:32,962
You know, darling,

80
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:36,591
you're gonna make somebody a real nice wife.

81
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:45,349
Cute.

82
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,395
Hmm.

83
00:07:53,608 --> 00:07:55,276
He's a big boy.

84
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,463
Yes, he is.

85
00:07:58,613 --> 00:08:02,909
Broke three of my guards arms, nearly
killed the only doctor we had out here.

86
00:08:03,075 --> 00:08:05,870
They call him Rocco the Clown.

87
00:08:06,037 --> 00:08:09,373
Was an underground wrestler
until he accidentally killed

88
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,667
one too many opponents in the ring.

89
00:08:22,428 --> 00:08:27,141
They spun it that he was retiring
so he could go out undefeated.

90
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,810
Bye bye, Rocco.

91
00:08:30,436 --> 00:08:34,023
And last but not least...

92
00:08:35,942 --> 00:08:37,735
Manuel Dyer.

93
00:08:37,902 --> 00:08:40,171
He prefers Manny the Prophet,

94
00:08:40,321 --> 00:08:43,866
but since he's batshit crazy,
we just call him "Mental" Manny.

95
00:08:45,326 --> 00:08:47,078
I've heard of him.

96
00:08:47,245 --> 00:08:50,456
He's responsible for the largest
mass-suicide in history.

97
00:08:50,665 --> 00:08:53,267
They tried to cover it up
as a giant building fire.

98
00:08:53,417 --> 00:08:57,271
Oh, right a fire. A fire that not one
single resident attempted to escape.

99
00:08:57,421 --> 00:09:00,233
We give ourselves to you, oh, Lord.

100
00:09:00,383 --> 00:09:03,010
Ash to ash, we join you again.

101
00:09:03,678 --> 00:09:05,930
Jesus came to me and said,

102
00:09:06,097 --> 00:09:08,574
this is the way to sit beside God.

103
00:09:08,724 --> 00:09:12,019
Burn away our sins, oh, Lord.

104
00:09:32,248 --> 00:09:33,474
Are you all right?

105
00:09:33,624 --> 00:09:35,334
I'm sorry.

106
00:09:35,501 --> 00:09:38,129
Can we take a break from these awful men?

107
00:09:38,296 --> 00:09:39,422
Of course.

108
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:41,132
Right this way.

109
00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:43,134
You're such a gentleman.

110
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:07,074
I'm sorry, I just...
Got a little overwhelmed.

111
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:09,577
Well, that's an understandable response.

112
00:10:09,744 --> 00:10:12,096
You shouldn't feel ashamed.

113
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:15,124
I'm just really hot in here.

114
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,294
Yes, uh...

115
00:10:18,461 --> 00:10:22,381
Well, now that you have seen who...

116
00:10:22,548 --> 00:10:24,550
what we host here,

117
00:10:24,717 --> 00:10:29,280
do you really think it's wise to
divulge it to the entire world?

118
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,225
All the inmates in our system should
be accounted for, and treated fairly.

119
00:10:33,392 --> 00:10:35,853
- They're still human beings.
- Human?

120
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,814
Have you seen anything in here
that's even remotely human?

121
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:43,628
It must be horrible working with such

122
00:10:43,778 --> 00:10:46,489
depraved individuals.

123
00:10:46,656 --> 00:10:50,701
Well, it's a dirty job
but someone has to do it.

124
00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:53,537
You poor thing.

125
00:10:53,704 --> 00:10:54,972
Miss Quinn, what, what...

126
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:56,874
Shh.

127
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,794
I have this little fetish for

128
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,796
men in bow ties.

129
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,883
Ever since I was

130
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,593
a little girl.

131
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:18,729
Oh...

132
00:11:23,025 --> 00:11:27,113
You are quite the tease, Miss Quinn.

133
00:11:48,092 --> 00:11:52,847
Oh, sugar, is it too...

134
00:12:01,814 --> 00:12:03,315
tight?

135
00:12:11,115 --> 00:12:13,868
Please, please, could somebody
help me in here?

136
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:16,461
Please, please!

137
00:12:35,306 --> 00:12:37,074
You can't be in here.

138
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:38,809
I'm here for our appointment.

139
00:12:47,651 --> 00:12:50,863
Here's the ball for baby. Nice and round.

140
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,716
Here's baby's hammer, how she likes to pound.

141
00:12:53,866 --> 00:12:58,120
Pound, pound, pound!

142
00:12:58,287 --> 00:12:59,747
Pound!

143
00:13:38,327 --> 00:13:40,079
Daddy.

144
00:13:41,747 --> 00:13:45,584
- How's my little doll face?
- Never better.

145
00:14:31,922 --> 00:14:35,217
Ah, the vic was found by the cleaning
staff about 30 minutes ago, Sheriff.

146
00:14:35,384 --> 00:14:37,970
It's pretty gruesome in there,
just to warn you.

147
00:14:38,137 --> 00:14:39,822
Here's what I think happened, okay?

148
00:14:39,972 --> 00:14:42,349
There's two attackers, disguised
as room service, maybe.

149
00:14:42,516 --> 00:14:44,351
They bust in, there's a scuffle here,
they're trying to rob her.

150
00:14:44,518 --> 00:14:46,787
There's all this spilled wine.
She comes over here,

151
00:14:46,937 --> 00:14:49,523
grabs the scissors to defend herself,
tries to stab one of them,

152
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,942
the other grabs the bottle,
cracks her over the head.

153
00:14:52,109 --> 00:14:53,569
She falls on the ground dazed.

154
00:14:53,736 --> 00:14:55,546
She's climbing and clawing
her way to the bed.

155
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:57,131
They're walking over her, laughing.

156
00:14:57,281 --> 00:14:58,532
They pin her down.

157
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:03,095
The one takes the wine bottle,
one, two, crack, glass everywhere.

158
00:15:03,245 --> 00:15:05,289
She's screaming, "Oh! My head is bleeding!

159
00:15:05,456 --> 00:15:06,540
You're killing me!"

160
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:07,933
She falls on one of the shards of glass.

161
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:12,313
It lodges in her neck, and when she rolls,
it slits her throat, and she bleeds out.

162
00:15:12,463 --> 00:15:14,381
That's how she died.

163
00:15:16,634 --> 00:15:20,054
Please dismount the dead body, deputy.

164
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:24,058
Oh, yeah, um... Just...

165
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:27,061
You just contaminated the entire crime scene.

166
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:31,749
Also, are you actually holding
the potential murder weapon

167
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:33,525
without gloves?

168
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:38,238
Guess who's our prime suspect
when we run that for prints, now.

169
00:15:42,618 --> 00:15:45,079
- May I?
- Yeah. Yeah.

170
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:46,956
There was only one attacker.

171
00:15:47,122 --> 00:15:48,791
He or she was already in the room.

172
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,477
There's no sign of struggle or
forced entry at the door.

173
00:15:51,627 --> 00:15:56,106
Also, there's no sign of anything
missing, so it's clearly not a robbery.

174
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:57,900
Our victim comes in to enjoy a glass of wine

175
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,902
when the attacker jumps out of the bathroom,

176
00:16:00,052 --> 00:16:02,780
where he or she has been hiding,
hence why the door is ajar.

177
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:07,368
The attacker grabs the bottle of wine,
hits our girl over the head.

178
00:16:07,518 --> 00:16:08,852
You were right there.

179
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:11,772
Our victim is dazed, she puts up a fight,

180
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:14,274
and the attacker slits her throat.

181
00:16:14,483 --> 00:16:16,443
Right in the aorta.

182
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,947
- Or jugular.
- Yeah. Yeah, jugular.

183
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:33,502
Uh...

184
00:16:33,669 --> 00:16:36,088
Maybe it's a Halloween thing?

185
00:16:38,757 --> 00:16:41,760
Maybe. Do you have a name?

186
00:16:41,927 --> 00:16:43,721
Uh, no. Her ID was missing.

187
00:16:43,887 --> 00:16:46,949
Did you check with the manager?

188
00:16:47,099 --> 00:16:50,769
Yeah, yeah. He speaks a different
dialect than I'm used to,

189
00:16:50,936 --> 00:16:53,522
but I'll give it another whirl.

190
00:16:59,403 --> 00:17:01,697
I hate Halloween.

191
00:17:24,386 --> 00:17:26,930
All right. Come on.

192
00:17:27,097 --> 00:17:28,348
You're a grown up.

193
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:31,160
You've got this, Morgan. You're the man.

194
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,287
Start acting like one. Just ask her out.

195
00:17:33,437 --> 00:17:36,523
Just ask her out.
It's no big deal. Huh? Right?

196
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,958
I mean if she says no...

197
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:41,986
You do work together. So it'll be
awkward every time you see her,

198
00:17:42,086 --> 00:17:45,491
- but if she says yes...
- Yes! Yes!

199
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,369
If she says yes, then you date
for a while, and then she dumps you.

200
00:17:49,578 --> 00:17:52,389
Stop, no. No, you're doing it again.

201
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:54,166
Don't stop! Don't stop!

202
00:17:55,417 --> 00:17:58,170
Just, okay, look, you're a gentleman.

203
00:17:58,337 --> 00:17:59,588
You're a gentleman. Go up to her.

204
00:17:59,755 --> 00:18:02,299
- Just walk up and say...
- God, I love your tits!

205
00:18:02,466 --> 00:18:04,343
Jesus, just walk up and say...

206
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:06,595
Lick them! Lick my tits! Lick my tits!

207
00:18:06,762 --> 00:18:07,721
Really?

208
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,782
My God, okay.

209
00:18:09,932 --> 00:18:13,811
Just walk up and say,
Laurie, I like you, and...

210
00:18:13,977 --> 00:18:15,270
You make my dick so hard.

211
00:18:15,437 --> 00:18:17,648
Okay. I can't do this.

212
00:18:22,945 --> 00:18:24,696
Don't be jealous.

213
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:27,991
Storage closet? Really?

214
00:18:28,158 --> 00:18:30,852
Yeah. Employees only, baby.

215
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,878
Your favorite customer awaits.

216
00:18:40,045 --> 00:18:41,463
Yay.

217
00:18:49,847 --> 00:18:52,015
You know, you're going to
have to give it up sometime.

218
00:18:52,182 --> 00:18:53,809
Why not him?

219
00:18:53,976 --> 00:18:55,661
I bet he'd be gentle.

220
00:18:55,811 --> 00:18:57,855
Maybe even cuddle after.

221
00:18:58,689 --> 00:19:00,791
I am not a virgin.

222
00:19:00,941 --> 00:19:02,442
I don't know why you would think that.

223
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:06,672
Laurie, my 13-year-old
cousin has the same costume.

224
00:19:06,822 --> 00:19:09,908
And even she is more
sexually active than you are.

225
00:19:10,075 --> 00:19:12,511
Well, I blame Tinder for that.

226
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:14,746
And who are you supposed to be?

227
00:19:14,913 --> 00:19:17,558
I'm Sexy Hillary Clinton.

228
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:23,547
What? You're saying you
wouldn't vote for these in 2016?

229
00:19:23,714 --> 00:19:28,010
Wow. Christina, I had no idea
you were so into politics.

230
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:31,013
The mashed potatoes are lukewarm.

231
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,765
The steak tastes like a charred, dirty boot.

232
00:19:33,932 --> 00:19:36,602
And what the hell is it you're wearing?

233
00:19:36,768 --> 00:19:38,520
I'm the Seventh Dr. Who.

234
00:19:38,687 --> 00:19:40,272
- Dr. What?
- Dr. Who.

235
00:19:40,439 --> 00:19:42,774
I'm asking you what is the doctor's name.

236
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:44,693
No, I know what you're
asking me, I'm trying to tell you.

237
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,737
Dr. Who.

238
00:19:47,696 --> 00:19:50,824
Now you're just being a smart ass.

239
00:19:50,991 --> 00:19:52,451
Oh, you know, I'll tell you what, Charlie,

240
00:19:52,618 --> 00:19:54,303
I'm gonna take this back
to the kitchen, all right,

241
00:19:54,453 --> 00:19:56,997
and we're going to make you, like,
a brand-spanking new one.

242
00:19:57,164 --> 00:19:59,082
Okay? No more dirty boot.

243
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,878
Jackass.

244
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:07,341
I'm Machete, motherfucker.

245
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:11,094
Well, you look like Pedro from Napoleon
Dynamite, if he was into bondage.

246
00:20:11,261 --> 00:20:13,430
And you, what are you?
Saturday Night Live's fever?

247
00:20:13,597 --> 00:20:15,641
Wow, you intentionally
mess up that reference?

248
00:20:15,807 --> 00:20:18,936
No, I'm dressed up as a real life superhero.

249
00:20:19,102 --> 00:20:21,313
Me. Did you see that game last week?

250
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,398
Yeah, no, you're an
intramural football legend.

251
00:20:23,565 --> 00:20:26,485
And what are you, gay Sherlock Holmes?

252
00:20:26,652 --> 00:20:28,320
Peace offering.

253
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,574
I need a Charlie special.

254
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:46,255
There you go.

255
00:20:47,756 --> 00:20:50,901
Jesus came back from the dead
quicker than this plate.

256
00:20:51,051 --> 00:20:52,594
Sorry.

257
00:21:05,691 --> 00:21:07,526
Enjoy.

258
00:21:09,403 --> 00:21:11,947
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

259
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,204
Do we really need five people
waiting on Charlie?

260
00:21:19,371 --> 00:21:22,124
- No, we can let Jason do it.
- Shh.

261
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:24,918
Tonight is opening night
at the Macon County Funhouse,

262
00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:27,045
a haunted attraction that
has caused some controversy

263
00:21:27,212 --> 00:21:29,548
in recent weeks drawing
from local urban legends.

264
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:33,844
One maze is actually based on Manuel
Dyer’s mass suicide 10 years ago.

265
00:21:34,011 --> 00:21:37,514
Is this in poor taste, or just
good old-fashioned spooky fun?

266
00:21:37,681 --> 00:21:40,309
Either way, fun starts tonight at 9:00 P.M.

267
00:21:40,475 --> 00:21:41,810
Back to you, Jack.

268
00:21:42,936 --> 00:21:46,440
It's just a bunch of right-wing a-holes
trying to shut down our Halloween fun.

269
00:21:46,606 --> 00:21:49,626
But if these are based on real crimes, those
people could have families around here.

270
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:52,504
What if the ghosts of the cult
are lurking in the halls?

271
00:21:52,654 --> 00:21:54,406
- Oh, my God, we have to go.
- I'm in.

272
00:21:54,573 --> 00:21:56,283
I'm taking the trash out.

273
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,994
Fine, we won't go.

274
00:21:59,703 --> 00:22:03,332
Then you two can just
hang out together. Alone.

275
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:07,377
I'm down to hang out if you want to.

276
00:22:07,544 --> 00:22:09,212
We can do that, we can hang out.

277
00:22:09,379 --> 00:22:11,465
Just the... no, we don't have to.

278
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:13,133
It's not...

279
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,968
I didn't say no.

280
00:22:15,135 --> 00:22:16,737
No, I know. I was just saying.

281
00:22:16,887 --> 00:22:19,056
Like, in case you didn't want to.

282
00:22:19,222 --> 00:22:20,724
I didn't want to assume or any...

283
00:22:20,891 --> 00:22:22,484
Just... what? Forget it.

284
00:22:24,853 --> 00:22:26,980
What?

285
00:22:27,147 --> 00:22:29,608
- I lost my boner.
- I'm gonna kill you.

286
00:22:29,775 --> 00:22:31,835
At this rate, you won't
get a handsy until you're 87.

287
00:22:31,985 --> 00:22:34,213
Yeah, and you're going to
have herpes for the 87th time.

288
00:22:34,363 --> 00:22:36,323
Yeah, he has herpes.

289
00:22:38,325 --> 00:22:39,785
You can only get it once.

290
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,246
I don't have herpes.

291
00:22:51,922 --> 00:22:53,673
Come on, guys.

292
00:23:36,925 --> 00:23:39,177
You hit me in the head
with a can of creamed corn.

293
00:23:39,344 --> 00:23:40,762
Well, you snuck up behind me in the dark.

294
00:23:40,929 --> 00:23:42,472
- What do you expect?
- Oh, come on.

295
00:23:42,639 --> 00:23:44,850
It's all in the spirit of Hallow's Eve cheer.

296
00:23:45,016 --> 00:23:47,744
Speaking of which, Gerardo's going
to take us to the fun house.

297
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:49,204
You guys should come with.

298
00:23:49,354 --> 00:23:51,273
What? I can't fit everybody.

299
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,984
Uh, you drive a Ford Ranger, Gerardo.

300
00:23:54,151 --> 00:23:55,961
Okay, it's the largest of the compact trucks.

301
00:23:56,111 --> 00:23:58,547
Fine, if you can fit in the back.

302
00:23:58,697 --> 00:24:00,991
I have to keep the inside clean for Rosalina.

303
00:24:01,158 --> 00:24:03,952
Listen, we're in. We've just got
to get these two pussies to go.

304
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:05,620
I didn't say that I wouldn't.

305
00:24:05,787 --> 00:24:07,330
- Oh, come on, guys.
- If you didn't want to go...

306
00:24:07,497 --> 00:24:10,600
Guy, come on, it's not
like the funhouse is positioned

307
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:14,796
creepily in the middle of nowhere with
only a broken down asylum nearby.

308
00:24:14,963 --> 00:24:19,009
Haunted by the ghosts of its
dead, deranged inmates.

309
00:24:19,176 --> 00:24:20,552
What's there to be afraid of? Come on.

310
00:24:20,719 --> 00:24:23,805
- Everything that you just said.
- Mm-hmm.

311
00:24:25,307 --> 00:24:27,476
Woo!

312
00:24:27,642 --> 00:24:29,269
Let's go, come on!

313
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,105
Let's do it!

314
00:24:33,523 --> 00:24:36,151
Will somebody bring me my check?

315
00:24:41,531 --> 00:24:43,550
Everything set up like we planned?

316
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,077
Yes, Daddy.

317
00:24:46,244 --> 00:24:49,498
Then let's give the boys a
tour of their new playground.

318
00:25:07,516 --> 00:25:09,559
Maybe the news is right.

319
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:13,188
I mean, this whole thing
feels a little exploitative.

320
00:25:14,648 --> 00:25:16,983
You think our customers are
gonna care that our theme

321
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,110
is too realistically violent?

322
00:25:19,277 --> 00:25:21,922
That's like getting mad that porn
has too much real sex in it.

323
00:25:22,072 --> 00:25:24,282
And that "bad press" is only helping us.

324
00:25:24,449 --> 00:25:27,244
#getkilledinmacontonight
is twittering on the Tweezer.

325
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:29,246
Who cares if someone's feelings get hurt?

326
00:25:29,412 --> 00:25:31,014
Tweezer is not a thing.

327
00:25:31,164 --> 00:25:32,958
What about your electric fence?

328
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:36,545
I don't want any punk kids
trying to sneak in for free.

329
00:25:36,711 --> 00:25:39,339
Pay, or don't play.

330
00:25:46,555 --> 00:25:48,615
Oh, my God!

331
00:25:48,765 --> 00:25:50,283
I see the animatronics work.

332
00:25:50,433 --> 00:25:51,993
Hope you didn't shit your pants there, Walt.

333
00:25:52,143 --> 00:25:54,354
You still got seven hours
on my clock, let's go.

334
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,075
Weed!

335
00:26:22,716 --> 00:26:26,428
Hey, that's some expensive shit.

336
00:26:29,764 --> 00:26:31,099
I was done with it.

337
00:26:45,822 --> 00:26:48,074
Fucking Dennis double booked us.

338
00:27:32,619 --> 00:27:34,537
Wait...

339
00:27:34,704 --> 00:27:36,831
No.

340
00:27:36,998 --> 00:27:40,168
No! This is wrong!

341
00:27:40,335 --> 00:27:42,587
Look at these portions!

342
00:27:42,754 --> 00:27:45,632
I didn't run a goddamn Cheesecake Factory!

343
00:27:50,095 --> 00:27:53,390
These aren't even taxidermist tools.

344
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,817
Sorry, friends.

345
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:06,194
I got a new flock now.

346
00:28:16,246 --> 00:28:19,082
Un-freaking-believable.

347
00:28:19,249 --> 00:28:20,875
On the biggest night of my life,

348
00:28:21,042 --> 00:28:23,461
and you guys are getting wacky
with the illegal paraphernalia.

349
00:28:23,628 --> 00:28:25,672
Does this look like Colorado to you?

350
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:27,816
Do I look like John Freaking Denver?

351
00:28:29,384 --> 00:28:31,469
You trying to get me arrested, guys?

352
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,448
Nobody's gonna get arrested.
It's basically legal everywhere.

353
00:28:35,598 --> 00:28:37,350
Not in my workplace.

354
00:28:37,517 --> 00:28:40,161
Not now, not ever.

355
00:28:40,311 --> 00:28:42,162
Now listen, you guys better pull your shit...

356
00:28:42,306 --> 00:28:44,816
Whoa! That's a hot mic. My apologies.

357
00:28:45,066 --> 00:28:47,026
Listen! Handle this!

358
00:28:48,486 --> 00:28:51,339
Uh... guys...

359
00:28:51,489 --> 00:28:53,116
You should all get back to...

360
00:28:53,616 --> 00:28:56,995
Aw, fuck it. Let me hit that thing.

361
00:28:58,913 --> 00:29:01,416
My fellow maniacs, all we wanted was

362
00:29:01,624 --> 00:29:04,335
for our grim art to be seen by the world.

363
00:29:04,502 --> 00:29:07,147
But they shunned us, locked us away,

364
00:29:07,297 --> 00:29:11,301
and now they have the gall
to profit off what they fear.

365
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:16,639
I don't know what Dennis told you,
but I'm the Stitchface Killer tonight.

366
00:29:18,141 --> 00:29:20,643
And your make-up looks terrible.

367
00:29:22,687 --> 00:29:25,982
I'm giving you a second
chance to go down in history

368
00:29:26,149 --> 00:29:29,527
as the most deranged sons
and daughters of bitches

369
00:29:29,694 --> 00:29:31,738
this world has ever seen.

370
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,217
No-one will ever forget our names.

371
00:29:36,367 --> 00:29:40,221
We will be the fuel to
their nightmares forever.

372
00:29:40,371 --> 00:29:44,751
I think I'm gonna put
you in the Heisman pose.

373
00:29:46,961 --> 00:29:50,131
I wonder where that other ass clown went.

374
00:29:53,593 --> 00:29:56,070
Oh, what the fuck!

375
00:30:09,025 --> 00:30:11,402
So tonight we're going to play a little game.

376
00:30:11,569 --> 00:30:13,530
What the hell do you think
you're doing, Daniel Day Lewis?

377
00:30:13,696 --> 00:30:17,075
This P.A. system is for announcements
and emergencies only, not...

378
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,453
Hey, I didn't hire you.

379
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,580
Who the hell are you?

380
00:30:22,747 --> 00:30:24,582
Well, you don't know me.

381
00:30:24,749 --> 00:30:27,210
But I'm pretty sure you know her.

382
00:30:29,712 --> 00:30:31,589
Eileen?

383
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,425
Hey, listen, man,
if you're her ex or something,

384
00:30:34,592 --> 00:30:36,594
it didn't mean anything.
We were just fuckbuddies, okay?

385
00:30:36,845 --> 00:30:39,656
That's not a very nice way
to talk about my daughter.

386
00:30:39,806 --> 00:30:41,891
Your daugh...

387
00:30:42,058 --> 00:30:44,519
Hey, uh... listen, pal,

388
00:30:44,686 --> 00:30:47,146
I'm sure you're probably not
feeling good about the fact

389
00:30:47,313 --> 00:30:48,731
that you couldn't keep her off the pole.

390
00:30:48,898 --> 00:30:50,834
That girl's got issues, okay?

391
00:30:50,984 --> 00:30:53,753
But this is a big night for me,
I built this place from the ground up.

392
00:30:53,903 --> 00:30:56,739
- And I'll be goddamned...
- Your ego is astounding.

393
00:30:58,032 --> 00:30:59,718
You think all this was your idea?

394
00:30:59,868 --> 00:31:01,494
Damn straight.

395
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:04,639
My little Eileen and I have been
planning this for quite some time.

396
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:08,585
You were just a puppet, and she pulled
just the right strings to ensure

397
00:31:08,751 --> 00:31:11,588
that you created the perfect
forum for our return.

398
00:31:18,845 --> 00:31:21,014
Sadly, Pinocchio,

399
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,641
we no longer have any use for you.

400
00:31:28,187 --> 00:31:30,415
I hope you like lawsuits.

401
00:31:30,565 --> 00:31:33,234
'Cause I'm gonna sue the shit out of you.

402
00:31:42,201 --> 00:31:43,786
Where was I?

403
00:31:47,081 --> 00:31:51,644
Aw, yes. Daddy has lots of
presents for you tonight,

404
00:31:51,794 --> 00:31:55,798
so, just like Christmas,
feel free to rip them open.

405
00:32:39,884 --> 00:32:42,553
This girl used to kill
popular kids at school.

406
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,880
She used to stitch their eyeballs!

407
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,892
- She did!
- No, she didn't.

408
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:49,352
What was her name?
What was her name? You remember.

409
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:50,770
- Her name is Stitchface.
- There it is.

410
00:32:50,937 --> 00:32:52,480
- My God!
- That's right.

411
00:32:52,647 --> 00:32:56,584
My brother's best friend's sister's cousin
knew one of the kids that went missing.

412
00:32:56,734 --> 00:33:00,154
There are so many degrees
of separation in that.

413
00:33:00,363 --> 00:33:02,423
So Stitchface, she's up
in Statesville too, huh?

414
00:33:02,573 --> 00:33:05,493
Some say there are
dozens of criminally insane

415
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,745
patients still up at Statesville.

416
00:33:07,912 --> 00:33:10,373
- Randall and I have been there 100 times.
- It was like, two times.

417
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:13,918
And I'll tell you, it's more surveiled
than Morgan's internet history.

418
00:33:14,085 --> 00:33:16,671
Okay, my cousin's Larry's
uncle's best friend...

419
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:18,214
You're such... shut up!

420
00:33:18,381 --> 00:33:21,526
Okay, knew a guy who disappeared.

421
00:33:21,676 --> 00:33:23,011
Oh, my God.

422
00:33:23,177 --> 00:33:26,681
Well, I don't know about you guys, but so
far this traffic jam ride's pretty sweet.

423
00:33:26,889 --> 00:33:28,891
- Yeah.
- Gerardo!

424
00:33:30,893 --> 00:33:32,745
- Why are we not moving?
- Shut up!

425
00:33:32,895 --> 00:33:34,731
Woo!

426
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,699
I hate Halloween.

427
00:33:44,866 --> 00:33:46,451
Why?

428
00:33:46,617 --> 00:33:48,619
Because you always send us to
the same cheesy haunted houses.

429
00:33:48,786 --> 00:33:52,390
Play the same 12 pop songs to the
same annoying pre-pubescents.

430
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,142
That's why we should get into podcasts.

431
00:33:54,292 --> 00:33:55,835
Nobody listens to the radio anymore.

432
00:33:56,002 --> 00:33:57,395
Why don't you partner
with my nephew, who's 10?

433
00:33:57,545 --> 00:33:59,714
Come on, we're partners.
We're Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

434
00:33:59,881 --> 00:34:01,382
We're as dead as they are on radio.

435
00:34:01,549 --> 00:34:02,925
- Can I...
- Hi.

436
00:34:03,092 --> 00:34:04,761
Help you two gents?

437
00:34:04,927 --> 00:34:07,488
- Uh, I'm Bob.
- And I'm Dave.

438
00:34:07,638 --> 00:34:10,224
We're Dr. Dave and Mr. Bob.

439
00:34:10,433 --> 00:34:12,410
- Senor Bob.
- Whatever.

440
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,272
We're the DJs from WKDE, and we're
here to cover the opening.

441
00:34:16,439 --> 00:34:19,025
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

442
00:34:19,192 --> 00:34:21,903
You're the two guys from
that morning radio show.

443
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,988
Well, yeah. We used to be.

444
00:34:24,155 --> 00:34:27,241
- About 15 years ago.
- 17.

445
00:34:27,408 --> 00:34:29,093
Oh, yeah.

446
00:34:29,243 --> 00:34:32,288
It's been a while since
I could listen to the radio.

447
00:34:32,455 --> 00:34:34,123
Is that, uh...

448
00:34:34,874 --> 00:34:36,793
Yeah, well, can't say I blame you.

449
00:34:37,043 --> 00:34:38,770
I wouldn't listen to us
either if I didn't have to.

450
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:42,340
Yeah. Uh, amigo, you got a little, um...

451
00:34:42,507 --> 00:34:44,943
flavor saver right...

452
00:34:45,093 --> 00:34:46,177
Right there, yeah. Huh?

453
00:34:46,344 --> 00:34:49,347
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

454
00:34:49,514 --> 00:34:50,723
Oh, yeah.

455
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:53,768
Oh, no, don't...

456
00:34:53,935 --> 00:34:56,996
No, don't do that.

457
00:34:57,146 --> 00:34:59,023
Okay! Okay.

458
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:01,359
- Okay, you got it.
- Got it. You did it.

459
00:35:01,526 --> 00:35:03,861
Uh, listen, uh...

460
00:35:04,028 --> 00:35:06,823
I'll just tell my guys
to bring the trucks back to...

461
00:35:07,073 --> 00:35:08,825
Back of the beard... back of the building.

462
00:35:08,991 --> 00:35:12,778
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
The stage is right in the center.

463
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:14,247
That's great.

464
00:35:14,413 --> 00:35:16,307
- Super, thank you.
- All right.

465
00:35:16,457 --> 00:35:18,960
- Bon appetit.
- All right. Nice guy.

466
00:35:19,127 --> 00:35:20,628
Dr. Dave.

467
00:35:49,115 --> 00:35:50,533
Welcome.

468
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,161
Oh. Free to the clergy.

469
00:35:57,999 --> 00:35:59,667
Well, I don't know about
you, Bob, but it looks like

470
00:35:59,834 --> 00:36:02,628
a killer scene tonight here
at the Macon County Funhouse

471
00:36:02,795 --> 00:36:04,547
on the Land of Illusion stage.

472
00:36:04,714 --> 00:36:05,982
That is right, Dr. Dave.

473
00:36:06,132 --> 00:36:09,193
People are literally losing their
heads to get in here tonight.

474
00:36:09,343 --> 00:36:10,278
It's crazy.

475
00:36:10,428 --> 00:36:12,930
I hope you mean that figuratively, Bob.
Otherwise, I'm making a run for it.

476
00:36:13,097 --> 00:36:14,515
I'll be right behind you.

477
00:36:14,682 --> 00:36:17,727
Stand here, please. Thank you.

478
00:36:20,646 --> 00:36:22,940
As I've always said, folks,
quit while you're ahead.

479
00:36:23,107 --> 00:36:24,609
- Absolutely.
- While you have a head.

480
00:36:24,775 --> 00:36:27,028
Perfectly said. Quit while you're giving...

481
00:36:27,236 --> 00:36:28,487
No, we can't go there.

482
00:36:32,992 --> 00:36:35,745
I've never been here but I don't like...

483
00:36:40,917 --> 00:36:42,210
Welcome!

484
00:36:43,336 --> 00:36:46,005
You'll not escape this park!

485
00:36:49,008 --> 00:36:51,469
I'm totally Instagramming this.

486
00:36:55,223 --> 00:36:56,933
We may need crowd control.

487
00:36:57,183 --> 00:37:00,102
I haven't seen a line like this
since that Justin Bieber concert.

488
00:37:00,269 --> 00:37:02,271
- Are you a Bieber fan?
- I'm not a Belieber, Bob.

489
00:37:02,438 --> 00:37:03,439
- Okay.
- Not a Belieber.

490
00:37:03,981 --> 00:37:05,691
You go first, Robbie.

491
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,152
I'm not scared.

492
00:37:17,411 --> 00:37:19,163
Where's Robbie?

493
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:20,598
He's probably outside waiting for us.

494
00:37:20,748 --> 00:37:22,333
The haunted hayride is the same thing.

495
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,085
#besthauntedhouseever.

496
00:37:24,252 --> 00:37:26,170
#ourfriendgotkidnappedbykillers!

497
00:37:26,337 --> 00:37:29,357
#longesthashtagever.

498
00:37:29,507 --> 00:37:32,527
Uh, don't forget, folks, you bring
six two liter bottles of Shasta,

499
00:37:32,677 --> 00:37:35,263
- what do they get, Bob?
- You get $5 off the entry fee.

500
00:37:35,471 --> 00:37:37,115
That's right, folks. Cashta for your Shasta.

501
00:37:37,265 --> 00:37:39,158
You'll be saving an arm and a leg.

502
00:37:39,308 --> 00:37:40,518
Okay.

503
00:37:40,685 --> 00:37:42,203
I tell you what, we're going
to take a little break here,

504
00:37:42,353 --> 00:37:44,080
and we'll be back in a few minutes.

505
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,707
Keep on having a good time
there, Macon county.

506
00:37:46,857 --> 00:37:48,776
That is not a good deal, Bob.

507
00:37:52,571 --> 00:37:55,116
Getting off in 40 minutes.

508
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,996
Oh, where you going, Danny Lame-o?

509
00:38:01,664 --> 00:38:03,975
This place is too scary for me.

510
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:07,128
Besides, only white people like this shit.

511
00:38:07,295 --> 00:38:09,630
Hey, how are we gonna get home?

512
00:38:11,424 --> 00:38:14,093
There are a lot of white people.

513
00:38:15,386 --> 00:38:17,513
Jesus Christ.

514
00:38:27,648 --> 00:38:31,085
Okay, please tell me that he licked
his lips at all of you, not just me?

515
00:38:34,196 --> 00:38:35,865
We're in. We're in, baby!

516
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:38,659
Adorbs. Who's protecting you?

517
00:38:40,745 --> 00:38:42,288
Why are you friends with her?

518
00:38:42,455 --> 00:38:44,457
We work together.

519
00:38:44,623 --> 00:38:46,792
Just such a cunt.

520
00:38:59,597 --> 00:39:02,308
No way you live, no way.

521
00:39:02,475 --> 00:39:04,643
Oh, got you, top hat.

522
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,204
Yeah.

523
00:39:06,354 --> 00:39:09,457
Picked the wrong
sheriff's deputy to mess with.

524
00:39:09,607 --> 00:39:14,045
Got you dead to rights, brown
jacket guy with weird hair.

525
00:39:14,195 --> 00:39:16,947
Ooh, trick shot. Nobody can stop me.

526
00:39:17,114 --> 00:39:19,200
I'm unstoppable.

527
00:39:19,467 --> 00:39:22,036
Like Jesse James.

528
00:39:22,244 --> 00:39:24,472
Macon County Sheriff's Office,
Deputy Doyle speaking.

529
00:39:24,622 --> 00:39:25,556
They killed my friend!

530
00:39:25,706 --> 00:39:27,416
There's blood everywhere, please help!

531
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:29,477
Yeah! Oh, yeah, Um...

532
00:39:29,627 --> 00:39:31,896
Just, sorry, one second.

533
00:39:32,046 --> 00:39:33,648
You called the right place. Um...

534
00:39:33,798 --> 00:39:36,108
Please just try to remain calm.

535
00:39:36,258 --> 00:39:39,595
Uh, police are coming. Where are you?

536
00:39:39,762 --> 00:39:41,155
I'm at the Macon County Funhouse

537
00:39:41,305 --> 00:39:42,723
Someone killed my friend!

538
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,683
Okay. Did you get a good look at the killer?

539
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:47,620
She looked like your mom last night!

540
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:51,065
What? That doesn't even make any sense.

541
00:39:51,232 --> 00:39:53,234
That's what she said.

542
00:39:53,401 --> 00:39:55,361
That makes even less sense
than what you just said.

543
00:39:55,528 --> 00:39:57,530
This line is for emergencies only, okay?

544
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,782
I have called ID. If you call back,
your butt will be arrested.

545
00:39:59,949 --> 00:40:01,175
I can trace you.

546
00:40:01,325 --> 00:40:03,035
My butt? Who talks like that?

547
00:40:03,202 --> 00:40:06,847
Who... The Law.
The Law is who talks like that.

548
00:40:06,997 --> 00:40:09,250
Okay? I am the Law.

549
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:15,273
Not gonna let one bad apple sour my night.

550
00:40:15,423 --> 00:40:19,009
No! Really?

551
00:40:20,136 --> 00:40:22,680
I was on level 48.

552
00:40:40,364 --> 00:40:42,842
Oh, dude, why do you think
we like this so much?

553
00:40:42,992 --> 00:40:46,928
Uh, obviously it's the high
of fight or flight adrenalin...

554
00:40:49,123 --> 00:40:50,791
Help me!

555
00:40:50,958 --> 00:40:52,668
Please!

556
00:40:52,835 --> 00:40:55,062
Why, what's happening?

557
00:41:02,928 --> 00:41:07,016
Oh, they gotta cast some better actors,
because you suck, dude! You suck.

558
00:41:10,102 --> 00:41:13,471
No! Oh, God, ah!

559
00:41:19,737 --> 00:41:21,213
I don't want to go first,
I don't want to go first.

560
00:41:21,363 --> 00:41:23,532
I don't want to go first, ah!

561
00:41:23,699 --> 00:41:25,701
Stop it.

562
00:41:29,246 --> 00:41:30,581
I feel like they're real.

563
00:41:30,831 --> 00:41:33,000
I feel like they're going to jump out.

564
00:41:33,167 --> 00:41:36,128
- Why are we in the front?
- I don't know.

565
00:41:36,295 --> 00:41:37,938
- Oh, look at his...
- That's gross.

566
00:41:38,088 --> 00:41:39,757
That's awful!

567
00:41:51,852 --> 00:41:53,229
Come on, man.

568
00:41:55,564 --> 00:41:57,816
I'm Vining this.

569
00:41:59,944 --> 00:42:02,530
Help me! Help me, please!

570
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,657
Christina, come on!

571
00:42:04,823 --> 00:42:06,617
Oh, oh!

572
00:42:09,578 --> 00:42:13,791
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! That's amazing.

573
00:42:15,334 --> 00:42:17,461
That's amazing, dude, did you see that?

574
00:42:17,628 --> 00:42:19,338
Get some of that shit.

575
00:42:21,131 --> 00:42:22,900
You're doing good.

576
00:42:26,345 --> 00:42:27,888
- Go, go, go.
- No.

577
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:32,393
Sadly, this place is less depressing
than my actual high school.

578
00:42:32,601 --> 00:42:34,103
Oh, God!

579
00:42:38,691 --> 00:42:40,985
Oh, my God, this looks so real.

580
00:42:41,151 --> 00:42:42,128
It's probably pig intestine.

581
00:42:42,278 --> 00:42:43,671
It's what they use in Day of the Dead.

582
00:42:43,821 --> 00:42:45,381
How do you know that?

583
00:42:45,531 --> 00:42:50,452
Uh, I'll take weed and Wikipedia instead
of paying for college for 500, Mr. Trebek.

584
00:42:54,456 --> 00:42:56,417
Get away! Get away from me!

585
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,012
- Jason, stop!
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

586
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,563
Oh, dude.

587
00:43:17,771 --> 00:43:19,273
There's got to be something there, for sure.

588
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,566
Yeah.

589
00:43:29,658 --> 00:43:32,620
Shit, that looks so real.

590
00:43:32,786 --> 00:43:34,722
Her neck literally slit open.

591
00:43:34,872 --> 00:43:36,415
That other one's fucking hot.

592
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,387
That was awesome!

593
00:43:53,265 --> 00:43:54,658
Can you help me find a bathroom?

594
00:43:54,808 --> 00:43:56,894
- Hell, yes.
- Wow, real subtle.

595
00:43:57,645 --> 00:43:59,605
I'm sorry, was that too subtle
for your virgin ears?

596
00:43:59,772 --> 00:44:00,706
We're gonna go fuck.

597
00:44:00,856 --> 00:44:02,691
Go find a funnel cake or something.

598
00:44:04,485 --> 00:44:06,153
Funnel cake. Uh-huh.

599
00:44:08,364 --> 00:44:10,366
And then there were two.

600
00:44:13,744 --> 00:44:15,429
Um...

601
00:44:15,579 --> 00:44:17,414
Do you ring toss?

602
00:44:18,791 --> 00:44:21,001
Well, not like professionally.

603
00:44:21,168 --> 00:44:23,754
I don't think I know anyone
who does that professionally.

604
00:44:23,921 --> 00:44:25,673
Oh, no?

605
00:44:25,881 --> 00:44:29,968
My cousin's brother's sister knows a guy.

606
00:44:30,135 --> 00:44:32,805
Oh, who's best friends
with the national champion...

607
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:53,742
Fresh security guard.

608
00:44:54,827 --> 00:44:56,578
Sashimi grade.

609
00:44:57,663 --> 00:44:59,456
Philistine.

610
00:45:02,376 --> 00:45:05,604
Mami, I thought you said you
were getting off work soon.

611
00:45:05,754 --> 00:45:08,173
I know, I'm ready for you.

612
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:10,526
You got more patients?

613
00:45:10,676 --> 00:45:14,738
You know I'm going to be
your only patient tonight.

614
00:45:14,888 --> 00:45:18,684
No, no, of course I'm ready.

615
00:45:18,851 --> 00:45:21,228
No, I can't go to your place.

616
00:45:21,395 --> 00:45:23,689
You know your cat hates me.

617
00:45:23,856 --> 00:45:27,025
I'm also a little allergic
to cats, I told you.

618
00:45:27,192 --> 00:45:30,612
Oh, I'm not allergic to that cat, baby.

619
00:45:36,827 --> 00:45:38,662
In 30, 35 minutes?

620
00:45:39,955 --> 00:45:41,582
What?

621
00:45:41,749 --> 00:45:44,084
Okay, fine, okay.

622
00:45:45,586 --> 00:45:47,296
Tell me what to do.

623
00:46:12,112 --> 00:46:14,281
No, the big one, the big one.

624
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:23,040
Was that girl hotter than me?

625
00:46:23,207 --> 00:46:24,917
- Of course not.
- That's what I thought.

626
00:46:28,128 --> 00:46:30,839
Hey, don't let that touch the ground.

627
00:46:31,089 --> 00:46:33,300
I'm not gonna put that back on now.

628
00:46:34,468 --> 00:46:36,762
Okay. Oh, yeah.

629
00:46:51,485 --> 00:46:53,212
You hear something?

630
00:46:53,362 --> 00:46:56,615
Of course I heard something.
We're in a haunted funhouse.

631
00:46:57,741 --> 00:46:59,993
- Don't be silly.
- Sorry.

632
00:47:01,995 --> 00:47:04,206
Oh, yeah! Oh, to the left.

633
00:47:04,456 --> 00:47:05,749
Left, left, left. No, no, no, the right.

634
00:47:05,916 --> 00:47:07,543
A little bit. Yeah.

635
00:47:07,793 --> 00:47:09,711
Right there, right there, right there.

636
00:47:09,878 --> 00:47:12,548
God! You suck at this.

637
00:47:12,798 --> 00:47:14,049
Come here.

638
00:47:16,426 --> 00:47:18,512
- Sorry!
- Oh, yeah.

639
00:47:19,596 --> 00:47:20,572
Call me a superhero.

640
00:47:20,722 --> 00:47:23,250
Superhero! Oh, yeah!

641
00:47:26,353 --> 00:47:28,188
Oh, my God!

642
00:47:31,692 --> 00:47:33,318
I got a cramp, I got a cramp.

643
00:47:33,485 --> 00:47:35,320
Okay, yeah.

644
00:47:39,408 --> 00:47:42,386
Call me Mr. President. Call me Mr. President.

645
00:48:00,387 --> 00:48:02,431
Yeah, off the forehead.

646
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:05,475
Oh, come on.

647
00:48:14,484 --> 00:48:17,321
Let me guess. Your friend's
been murdered at the funhouse.

648
00:48:17,487 --> 00:48:19,939
They're coming after me now.

649
00:48:21,491 --> 00:48:24,368
Wow, that was actually pretty realistic.

650
00:48:32,961 --> 00:48:35,505
Why don't you freshen up?
I'll go get us a corn dog.

651
00:48:35,672 --> 00:48:38,091
I think I've had enough meat for one night.

652
00:48:38,258 --> 00:48:39,801
You want a beer, then?

653
00:48:39,968 --> 00:48:42,012
Does it look like I drink beer?

654
00:48:42,179 --> 00:48:44,765
Well, does it look like
they have skinny margaritas?

655
00:48:51,605 --> 00:48:54,107
Do you think they've ever
had sex in a non-public place?

656
00:48:55,233 --> 00:48:57,235
Nope. They're shameless.

657
00:48:57,569 --> 00:49:00,322
But I get sometimes how
the danger element can be fun.

658
00:49:00,489 --> 00:49:02,324
Don't you think?

659
00:49:02,491 --> 00:49:06,153
No. No, I get nervous peeing at the diner.

660
00:49:08,455 --> 00:49:10,290
Okay.

661
00:49:13,502 --> 00:49:15,253
So, um...

662
00:49:16,088 --> 00:49:18,423
Have you ever had sex in a public place?

663
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:20,342
Oh.

664
00:49:20,509 --> 00:49:22,344
- Maybe.
- Yeah?

665
00:49:22,511 --> 00:49:24,930
But I usually save
the sex talk for the third date.

666
00:49:25,097 --> 00:49:26,974
So...

667
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:28,475
Finally got one.

668
00:49:28,642 --> 00:49:32,904
So, which date is this?

669
00:49:37,609 --> 00:49:39,611
I'm sorry, what?

670
00:49:44,658 --> 00:49:46,343
Uh...

671
00:49:46,493 --> 00:49:49,121
I was just saying that it's your turn.

672
00:49:54,251 --> 00:49:55,627
...just like all my favorite stuff.

673
00:49:55,794 --> 00:49:58,422
Um, what about liquid nitrogen?

674
00:50:00,173 --> 00:50:05,762
Walt Disney, the T-1000, and, uh, semen.

675
00:50:05,929 --> 00:50:07,597
That's the weirdest
conversation I've ever heard.

676
00:50:07,764 --> 00:50:08,807
Always.

677
00:50:08,974 --> 00:50:10,308
- Hey.
- Here he is.

678
00:50:10,475 --> 00:50:11,810
That was fast.

679
00:50:11,977 --> 00:50:13,562
That's what your mom said last night.

680
00:50:13,729 --> 00:50:15,230
Oh!

681
00:50:15,397 --> 00:50:16,748
Not a good thing, if she said that.

682
00:50:16,898 --> 00:50:20,444
It was a good thing when she said it
to me, because I was still inside.

683
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:22,654
Oh, double down the mom joke.

684
00:50:22,821 --> 00:50:24,322
You never stop.

685
00:50:24,489 --> 00:50:26,425
I won't stop. Not until she tells me to stop.

686
00:50:26,575 --> 00:50:28,368
- There's a hat trick.
- I'm hitting it right.

687
00:50:28,535 --> 00:50:31,329
Oh, come on, guys.

688
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:54,368
Jeez.

689
00:50:54,728 --> 00:50:57,689
Someone takes their job
a little too seriously.

690
00:50:59,316 --> 00:51:02,527
What are you gonna do? Cut me with that?

691
00:51:05,155 --> 00:51:08,533
Okay, isn't this a timeout
zone for the freak show?

692
00:51:14,706 --> 00:51:16,249
Crazy bitch!

693
00:51:17,667 --> 00:51:19,586
You cut my face!

694
00:51:28,762 --> 00:51:30,388
She should be here by now.

695
00:51:30,555 --> 00:51:31,723
Maybe she got lost.

696
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:33,558
This place is literally a maze.

697
00:51:33,725 --> 00:51:35,644
Yeah, you guys are right.

698
00:51:35,811 --> 00:51:38,313
We should definitely split up
and go look for her.

699
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,416
Yeah, especially if there's
some candy apples on the way.

700
00:51:41,566 --> 00:51:43,502
It's like babysitting toddlers.

701
00:51:43,652 --> 00:51:45,237
Who are always stoned.

702
00:52:11,555 --> 00:52:12,931
Bitch!

703
00:52:13,932 --> 00:52:16,518
You'll pay for my face!

704
00:53:59,371 --> 00:54:00,555
Hodges.

705
00:54:00,705 --> 00:54:04,542
This is Sam Myers. I received a
call from your deputy, Doyle

706
00:54:04,709 --> 00:54:07,128
about one of my reporters, Jessica Quinn.

707
00:54:07,295 --> 00:54:09,673
Yes, do you happen to
know why she was in town?

708
00:54:09,923 --> 00:54:12,425
She's a freelancer, I
really don't know anything

709
00:54:12,592 --> 00:54:14,010
until the story's on my desk.

710
00:54:14,177 --> 00:54:17,472
But before she left she mentioned something
about an old asylum near your town.

711
00:54:18,598 --> 00:54:20,433
Is everything okay?

712
00:54:21,935 --> 00:54:24,479
Thank you for your help. Be in touch.

713
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:31,152
You've reached the voice-mail
of Deputy William Doyle.

714
00:54:31,319 --> 00:54:33,046
Please leave a message after the beep. Beep.

715
00:54:33,196 --> 00:54:34,281
That was me.

716
00:54:41,496 --> 00:54:43,498
Is that Christina?

717
00:54:49,546 --> 00:54:52,007
- Christina!
- Jason, wait up!

718
00:54:53,925 --> 00:54:56,344
Guys? Guys?

719
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:58,263
Where the fuck are you guys?

720
00:55:00,506 --> 00:55:02,049
Guys?

721
00:55:03,268 --> 00:55:04,436
Oh, shit.

722
00:55:07,314 --> 00:55:08,648
Jason!

723
00:55:10,817 --> 00:55:12,335
Okay, guys, we already split up twice.

724
00:55:12,485 --> 00:55:14,195
Third time is not a charm!

725
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:21,202
- Laurie!
- Come on!

726
00:55:26,166 --> 00:55:27,767
Where are you? Christina?

727
00:55:27,917 --> 00:55:29,294
Jason?

728
00:55:29,461 --> 00:55:31,087
No.

729
00:55:31,254 --> 00:55:32,881
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

730
00:55:34,132 --> 00:55:36,843
Christina! Christina, baby!

731
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:38,345
Christina!

732
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:43,141
Christina, baby!

733
00:55:43,892 --> 00:55:45,769
What the fuck is going on here?

734
00:55:51,775 --> 00:55:53,485
Oh, my God!

735
00:56:04,662 --> 00:56:06,181
- Fucking...
- No, no, no!

736
00:56:06,331 --> 00:56:08,466
We have to get out of here!

737
00:56:09,376 --> 00:56:11,753
No talking in class.

738
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,254
We have to get out of here!

739
00:56:18,468 --> 00:56:20,637
Hey! Hey, guys.

740
00:56:20,804 --> 00:56:22,472
Where have you guys been?

741
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:25,141
- Um, we've been...
- Looking for Christina.

742
00:56:25,308 --> 00:56:27,977
- No, no, no!
- Jason, Jason, Jason!

743
00:56:28,144 --> 00:56:30,205
- Jason!
- Whoa, man, what's the matter?

744
00:56:30,355 --> 00:56:33,149
It's not funny, you guys. This is all real.

745
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,901
- People are dying!
- It's locked!

746
00:56:35,110 --> 00:56:37,362
- They locked us in!
- Oh, come on. What?

747
00:56:37,529 --> 00:56:39,697
We can't get out. They locked us in.

748
00:56:50,166 --> 00:56:52,210
Now would be a good time to run.

749
00:56:55,046 --> 00:56:57,590
I always thought a fear of clowns was

750
00:56:57,757 --> 00:57:01,302
just subverting what used
to be a happy childhood memory.

751
00:57:03,513 --> 00:57:05,848
Although this clown is pretty scar...

752
00:57:07,767 --> 00:57:10,228
- Randall!
- Wow.

753
00:57:25,243 --> 00:57:27,454
This town was a paradise
before you brought in

754
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:31,725
all your dugs and hook-whores...
prostitutes and violence.

755
00:57:31,875 --> 00:57:33,768
You scum make me sick, you know that?

756
00:57:33,918 --> 00:57:35,270
Doyle

757
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:38,173
Hi. Just, uh... You scared
the bejeesus out of me.

758
00:57:38,423 --> 00:57:39,924
Why aren't you answering your phone?

759
00:57:40,175 --> 00:57:43,178
Uh, had a coffee accident.

760
00:57:44,345 --> 00:57:45,555
Again?

761
00:57:46,556 --> 00:57:48,641
Why is the station line off the hook?

762
00:57:48,808 --> 00:57:50,935
Yeah, sorry about that.
It was just a bunch of prank callers

763
00:57:51,102 --> 00:57:53,455
from the funhouse messing with me.

764
00:57:53,605 --> 00:57:55,773
Gear up. We're going to Statesville.

765
00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:58,735
The asylum?

766
00:57:59,903 --> 00:58:02,906
We're going on a mission. It's go time.

767
00:58:03,072 --> 00:58:05,133
This is so cool.

768
00:58:05,283 --> 00:58:08,369
All right, right behind you, sheriff.

769
00:58:09,829 --> 00:58:11,539
Do you have an extra set of keys?

770
00:58:16,628 --> 00:58:18,338
Mikey, hurry!

771
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,730
Wait, wait, wait! It's Mikey!

772
00:58:35,897 --> 00:58:37,440
- Wait, Laurie!
- Come on.

773
00:58:37,607 --> 00:58:39,317
Come on!

774
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:44,739
What the fuck!

775
00:58:51,371 --> 00:58:52,664
Go, go, go!

776
00:58:59,629 --> 00:59:01,381
They've locked the gate!

777
00:59:03,716 --> 00:59:05,301
- Climb it!
- No, it's electric, it's electric!

778
00:59:08,805 --> 00:59:10,265
- Go under!
- Oh, God!

779
00:59:10,431 --> 00:59:12,016
Laurie, go under!

780
00:59:12,183 --> 00:59:13,977
- Shit!
- Come on! Laurie!

781
00:59:19,023 --> 00:59:20,525
Get off my friend!

782
00:59:24,654 --> 00:59:26,072
No! Jason!

783
00:59:26,614 --> 00:59:28,199
Just go!

784
00:59:28,366 --> 00:59:29,993
No!

785
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:34,888
- Morgan, go get help!
- Laurie!

786
01:00:05,278 --> 01:00:06,463
Miss?

787
01:00:06,613 --> 01:00:07,989
Are you okay?

788
01:00:09,574 --> 01:00:11,367
Are you dead?

789
01:00:13,661 --> 01:00:15,580
Holy fuck.

790
01:00:22,795 --> 01:00:25,857
Sheriff's department. Anybody here?

791
01:00:26,007 --> 01:00:28,943
Are you hoping the killer answers us?

792
01:00:29,093 --> 01:00:31,763
I thought that's what we're supposed to say.

793
01:00:40,521 --> 01:00:43,483
He's dead. He's definitely dead.

794
01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:47,028
Oh, okay. I'll follow you.

795
01:00:51,699 --> 01:00:52,992
Doyle.

796
01:00:54,118 --> 01:00:56,286
Go on without me, it's okay.

797
01:00:59,374 --> 01:01:01,334
What kind of shoes are you wearing?

798
01:01:17,058 --> 01:01:19,702
Dispatch, I need immediate
backup and forensics

799
01:01:19,852 --> 01:01:22,372
- to my location, now.
- What's going on?

800
01:01:22,522 --> 01:01:24,499
What were you saying about
the kids and those prank calls?

801
01:01:24,649 --> 01:01:27,276
Just that their friends were being
murdered at the Funhouse, why?

802
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:30,530
What, what?

803
01:01:30,697 --> 01:01:33,157
Oh, crapola.

804
01:01:45,628 --> 01:01:49,257
I hate nature. I hate nature.

805
01:02:01,728 --> 01:02:03,980
Woo! I'm saved!

806
01:02:07,233 --> 01:02:09,193
Stop, or I'll shoot!

807
01:02:09,944 --> 01:02:11,904
Wait, what?

808
01:02:13,448 --> 01:02:16,075
What the fuck?

809
01:02:17,618 --> 01:02:19,454
Hands where I can see them!

810
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:22,874
I can't raise my right arm
because you just shot it!

811
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,709
Did I say take the shot?

812
01:02:24,876 --> 01:02:26,294
I'm sorry, there was a lot going on.

813
01:02:26,461 --> 01:02:27,754
I don't remember, honestly.

814
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,338
I take it you're not one of the bad guys.

815
01:02:29,505 --> 01:02:32,216
The bad... oh, you mean
the deranged serial killers

816
01:02:32,383 --> 01:02:34,469
who are pretending to be haunted house
characters and killing everybody?

817
01:02:34,635 --> 01:02:36,012
No, I just came from there.

818
01:02:36,179 --> 01:02:37,597
I didn't know it was more dangerous out here.

819
01:02:37,764 --> 01:02:38,931
- May I?
- Yes.

820
01:02:39,098 --> 01:02:40,575
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

821
01:02:40,725 --> 01:02:44,662
In my defense, I yelled at you
from the cop car, but you just...

822
01:02:44,812 --> 01:02:46,272
kept running at me.

823
01:02:46,439 --> 01:02:47,815
I don't have a weapon.

824
01:02:47,982 --> 01:02:50,109
You're threatened by my
awkward running skills?

825
01:02:50,318 --> 01:02:52,045
You barely grazed him.

826
01:02:52,195 --> 01:02:56,240
Now, you said killers, with an "s".

827
01:02:56,407 --> 01:02:57,700
How many are we talking about?

828
01:02:57,867 --> 01:02:58,993
Yeah, I don't know.

829
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:00,578
It was like, five or six, I think.

830
01:03:00,745 --> 01:03:02,205
Oh.

831
01:03:02,371 --> 01:03:03,414
We have to go in there.

832
01:03:03,581 --> 01:03:05,642
Jesus.

833
01:03:05,792 --> 01:03:08,002
Okay, time out. Quick headcount here.

834
01:03:08,169 --> 01:03:13,066
You me and this kid are going to go
take on five or six serial killers?

835
01:03:14,216 --> 01:03:16,334
With no backup?

836
01:03:36,155 --> 01:03:38,366
I thought you could use some help.

837
01:03:39,492 --> 01:03:42,787
After all, Machete does the cutting.

838
01:03:45,122 --> 01:03:47,792
I'm confused. Is that the real Machete?

839
01:03:49,961 --> 01:03:53,923
I've never seen the films.
They're too violent for me.

840
01:04:14,235 --> 01:04:15,528
It's okay.

841
01:04:19,156 --> 01:04:21,033
That's it, that's it.

842
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:34,922
I bet you've got great teeth.

843
01:04:36,132 --> 01:04:38,342
No! No!

844
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:43,055
Your bicuspids...

845
01:04:44,098 --> 01:04:47,810
Somebody must be a teeth grinder, huh?

846
01:04:58,613 --> 01:05:01,073
One patient at a time!

847
01:05:01,949 --> 01:05:04,535
Get off of me! Get off of me!

848
01:05:22,053 --> 01:05:23,512
Hey, Doc?

849
01:05:28,976 --> 01:05:31,562
I always hated going to the dentist.

850
01:05:31,729 --> 01:05:33,331
Come on. Are you okay?

851
01:05:33,481 --> 01:05:35,650
- Yeah.
- Come on.

852
01:05:36,651 --> 01:05:37,944
I got you.

853
01:05:45,117 --> 01:05:47,495
Wowsa, sure glad we get to watch the mayhem

854
01:05:47,662 --> 01:05:49,222
from the safety of our booth, Bob.

855
01:05:49,372 --> 01:05:51,082
Well, yowza, Dr. Dave,
I wouldn't be too sure,

856
01:05:51,248 --> 01:05:54,418
because here comes one
of those maniacs right now.

857
01:05:54,585 --> 01:05:56,771
And I got to tell you folks,

858
01:05:56,921 --> 01:06:00,007
these guys take their jobs
real, uh, seriously.

859
01:06:00,174 --> 01:06:02,551
I am kind of freaked out
by weirdo Jesus here.

860
01:06:02,718 --> 01:06:04,095
You should be.

861
01:06:06,889 --> 01:06:09,642
Uh-oh, folks. Looks like
Bob just got murdered.

862
01:06:09,809 --> 01:06:12,829
It's about time. Bob?

863
01:06:12,979 --> 01:06:15,764
Okay, joke's over, you got me.

864
01:06:17,024 --> 01:06:18,901
You know what I hate more than...

865
01:06:19,068 --> 01:06:20,319
stupid people?

866
01:06:20,528 --> 01:06:24,115
- Velcro? Democrats?
- Fucking radio DJs.

867
01:06:26,659 --> 01:06:28,119
- We're live on the air.
- Fuck! I'm sorry.

868
01:06:28,285 --> 01:06:29,704
What's wrong with you, bozo?

869
01:06:29,870 --> 01:06:32,373
Pretty much everything.

870
01:06:46,512 --> 01:06:49,140
Hello, boys and ghouls.

871
01:06:49,306 --> 01:06:51,559
We've come to a very special
portion of the evening.

872
01:06:51,726 --> 01:06:53,994
You having a good time?

873
01:07:10,202 --> 01:07:12,288
These games look so fun.

874
01:07:13,789 --> 01:07:16,309
I'm not going to play them now
with all these dead people.

875
01:07:16,459 --> 01:07:18,561
That would be in poor taste.

876
01:07:18,711 --> 01:07:22,798
If you say one more thing,
I will shoot you myself.

877
01:07:32,391 --> 01:07:33,534
All right, come on.

878
01:07:34,584 --> 01:07:36,253
You're gonna be okay.

879
01:07:40,066 --> 01:07:41,817
Why did you do that?

880
01:07:41,984 --> 01:07:43,903
Are you crazy? Do you know
what's happening out there?

881
01:07:44,111 --> 01:07:47,531
Yeah, I'm taking nutshots from a bumblebee.

882
01:07:49,075 --> 01:07:51,202
Okay, come on, you have to help me.

883
01:07:52,453 --> 01:07:54,288
What the hell happened to him?

884
01:07:54,455 --> 01:07:56,290
You don't want to know.

885
01:07:59,585 --> 01:08:02,171
I am amazed at how desensitized you all are.

886
01:08:02,421 --> 01:08:05,674
You have been lapping up gore
like a ride at Disneyland.

887
01:08:05,841 --> 01:08:08,402
You truly are sick individuals.

888
01:08:12,556 --> 01:08:16,102
But the thing is, it's all been real.

889
01:08:17,603 --> 01:08:19,313
It's all been real.

890
01:08:19,855 --> 01:08:23,234
We really are killing people
and we have been all evening.

891
01:08:27,696 --> 01:08:29,657
You don't believe me.

892
01:08:31,534 --> 01:08:33,828
You don't believe me?

893
01:08:39,834 --> 01:08:41,335
He's alive?

894
01:08:53,764 --> 01:08:58,227
Relax, Catherine. It's only death.

895
01:09:00,187 --> 01:09:02,198
I think it's time for our final act.

896
01:09:04,859 --> 01:09:06,902
Make it a good one, boys!

897
01:09:30,217 --> 01:09:31,844
Move! Move!

898
01:09:36,307 --> 01:09:39,727
You guys collect as many people as you
can and get them the hell out of here.

899
01:09:39,894 --> 01:09:41,353
What are you gonna...

900
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,857
Okay, uh, guess it's just us three amigos.

901
01:09:45,399 --> 01:09:46,901
That's because it's three of us.

902
01:09:47,067 --> 01:09:49,028
Not because I'm racist.
I have a lot of Mexican friends.

903
01:09:49,236 --> 01:09:50,404
A couple blacks.

904
01:09:50,571 --> 01:09:51,655
Let's go.

905
01:10:02,875 --> 01:10:05,920
Hey! I don't do take out!

906
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:17,180
Hey, man, what the hell? Get off of me!

907
01:10:34,406 --> 01:10:36,242
I can't walk anymore.

908
01:10:36,408 --> 01:10:38,094
Okay. You're gonna be okay.

909
01:10:38,244 --> 01:10:41,372
He literally can't walk.
He's gonna get us killed.

910
01:10:41,538 --> 01:10:43,207
He can hear you.

911
01:11:25,582 --> 01:11:28,561
Hey, man, I'm getting the fuck out of here.

912
01:11:33,132 --> 01:11:35,092
You look nice today, Mom.

913
01:11:40,306 --> 01:11:41,598
Oh, Laurie, please be okay.

914
01:11:41,765 --> 01:11:43,350
Hurry, hurry!

915
01:11:43,517 --> 01:11:45,311
Head towards the main road,
help's on the way. Go! Move!

916
01:11:45,477 --> 01:11:47,479
Move! It's okay.

917
01:11:53,402 --> 01:11:55,070
Clown!

918
01:11:55,237 --> 01:11:56,739
Whoa, okay.

919
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:08,876
No way you live. No way.

920
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:12,188
Oh, shoot. Okay, yeah.

921
01:12:12,338 --> 01:12:14,256
Oh, come on!

922
01:12:15,466 --> 01:12:17,009
Oh, fiddlesticks.

923
01:12:17,176 --> 01:12:19,595
You are so bad at this.

924
01:12:19,762 --> 01:12:21,472
Morgan!

925
01:12:22,890 --> 01:12:24,391
Holy shit!

926
01:12:24,558 --> 01:12:26,101
Holy shit!

927
01:12:42,951 --> 01:12:44,470
Oh, oh, not dead! Not dead!

928
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:46,330
Still alive! Still alive!

929
01:12:46,497 --> 01:12:48,432
Go, go, go, go, go!

930
01:12:48,582 --> 01:12:50,417
Gerardo!

931
01:13:33,627 --> 01:13:35,396
Officer.

932
01:13:35,546 --> 01:13:39,716
Um, he was a friend.

933
01:13:39,883 --> 01:13:42,278
The maniacs got him.

934
01:13:42,428 --> 01:13:46,473
I just wanted to dress him properly.

935
01:13:49,768 --> 01:13:51,453
I know this looks bad, but...

936
01:13:51,603 --> 01:13:54,064
They gave me inferior tools.

937
01:13:55,399 --> 01:13:57,359
You can shoot him.

938
01:14:06,994 --> 01:14:08,412
Aw.

939
01:14:08,579 --> 01:14:10,539
There was so much more blood than I expected.

940
01:14:12,249 --> 01:14:14,418
I've never shot a man.

941
01:14:15,586 --> 01:14:16,920
Clearly.

942
01:14:18,839 --> 01:14:20,165
All right, get it out.

943
01:14:45,449 --> 01:14:47,910
Okay, uh, just give me a minute.

944
01:14:48,076 --> 01:14:50,245
I got this, uh...

945
01:14:50,412 --> 01:14:52,498
Standby for a plan.

946
01:14:58,795 --> 01:15:02,758
Okay, there are plenty of people out there
right now that still need our help.

947
01:15:02,925 --> 01:15:05,486
We can selfishly try and save ourselves,

948
01:15:05,636 --> 01:15:07,988
or we fight back.

949
01:15:08,138 --> 01:15:10,474
That, uh, took the words
right out of my mouth.

950
01:15:10,641 --> 01:15:11,892
That's exactly what I was gonna say.

951
01:15:12,059 --> 01:15:14,686
So, what psychos do we have left?

952
01:15:14,853 --> 01:15:17,022
Well, there's Creepy Clown Dude.

953
01:15:17,189 --> 01:15:19,041
Psycho Stitch-bitch. Tubby chef.

954
01:15:19,191 --> 01:15:21,276
Yeah, and Jesus Manson.

955
01:15:21,443 --> 01:15:24,588
Okay, Bumblebee, you go gather
a group and go after Stitchgirl.

956
01:15:24,738 --> 01:15:27,199
Machete and Dr. Who go after Tubby Chef.

957
01:15:27,366 --> 01:15:29,535
And I'll take Creepy Jesus.

958
01:15:29,701 --> 01:15:31,203
What about Scary Clown Dude?

959
01:15:31,370 --> 01:15:32,913
Uh...

960
01:15:35,374 --> 01:15:37,960
Just hope none of us run into him?

961
01:15:38,126 --> 01:15:39,770
- Yeah, that sounds good.
- Yeah.

962
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:42,256
- That's a good plan.
- Great. All right.

963
01:15:42,422 --> 01:15:43,899
Okay.

964
01:15:44,049 --> 01:15:45,676
- Laurie?
- Yeah?

965
01:16:01,358 --> 01:16:04,111
I'd really love that third
date so let's try not to,

966
01:16:04,278 --> 01:16:05,779
you know, die, okay?

967
01:16:05,946 --> 01:16:07,447
Okay.

968
01:16:22,796 --> 01:16:24,506
I guess that's us.

969
01:16:24,673 --> 01:16:26,300
Let's go.

970
01:16:27,676 --> 01:16:29,177
Third date.

971
01:16:34,141 --> 01:16:36,393
- You ready?
- Yeah.

972
01:16:43,233 --> 01:16:47,379
I can't believe how many of you
allowed us to kill you tonight.

973
01:16:49,698 --> 01:16:51,742
We finally have a challenger.

974
01:16:51,908 --> 01:16:53,469
Daddy!

975
01:16:53,619 --> 01:16:57,247
Don't worry, sweetheart, the gun
pointed at my head is purely for show.

976
01:17:00,042 --> 01:17:02,519
This young lady and I go way back.

977
01:17:02,669 --> 01:17:04,921
She's just a bit irked about her mother.

978
01:17:23,357 --> 01:17:25,233
I've got her.

979
01:17:29,988 --> 01:17:31,823
Guys?

980
01:17:41,416 --> 01:17:43,460
I knew it was gonna be me.

981
01:17:53,345 --> 01:17:55,113
Are you using me as a human shield?

982
01:17:55,263 --> 01:17:56,515
Absolutely not.

983
01:18:14,366 --> 01:18:16,034
Don't move!

984
01:18:21,998 --> 01:18:23,892
I thought we'd lost you in the fire.

985
01:18:24,042 --> 01:18:25,752
Turn around.

986
01:18:27,671 --> 01:18:31,299
Turn around.

987
01:18:43,061 --> 01:18:45,480
Look at you.

988
01:18:48,191 --> 01:18:50,610
You're so beautiful.

989
01:18:50,777 --> 01:18:52,404
It's uncanny.

990
01:18:55,198 --> 01:18:57,993
You look so much like your mother.

991
01:19:13,425 --> 01:19:15,552
Relax, Dad.

992
01:19:17,554 --> 01:19:19,514
It's only death.

993
01:19:41,953 --> 01:19:43,789
You want a cook-off, bitch?

994
01:19:43,955 --> 01:19:46,917
Think fast, fry cook.

995
01:19:58,386 --> 01:20:00,697
Why the fuck is that on?

996
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:09,147
No! No!

997
01:20:33,922 --> 01:20:36,091
Son of a bitch.

998
01:20:41,930 --> 01:20:45,392
You got this, Doyle. You got this.

999
01:20:45,559 --> 01:20:47,477
Hey there, big guy.

1000
01:20:49,271 --> 01:20:52,399
You know, I've been thinking. You and I,

1001
01:20:52,566 --> 01:20:55,026
we got off on the wrong foot completely.

1002
01:20:55,193 --> 01:20:56,987
I shot at you first.

1003
01:20:57,153 --> 01:20:59,339
That, that's on me, you know?

1004
01:20:59,489 --> 01:21:02,784
And, honestly, for someone who would wear

1005
01:21:02,951 --> 01:21:05,787
another person's face
on top of their own face,

1006
01:21:05,954 --> 01:21:11,209
you seem like a fairly
reasonable, human thing.

1007
01:21:11,418 --> 01:21:13,753
So why don't you just
stop swinging the hammer,

1008
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:15,422
put it down and you and I can talk about it?

1009
01:21:15,589 --> 01:21:18,008
Man to giant man.

1010
01:21:20,635 --> 01:21:21,761
Or not.

1011
01:21:30,395 --> 01:21:32,229
Wyatt Earp, mother...

1012
01:21:40,071 --> 01:21:41,489
Hey, Stichbitch.

1013
01:21:49,956 --> 01:21:52,517
Now we all have fun toys.

1014
01:21:52,667 --> 01:21:54,294
Let's play.

1015
01:22:11,061 --> 01:22:13,355
Let's have a family reunion...

1016
01:22:13,521 --> 01:22:14,856
in Hell.

1017
01:22:45,887 --> 01:22:47,472
Fuck!

1018
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:10,286
Whoa, no, no, no, no!

1019
01:23:10,453 --> 01:23:12,163
Don't shoot! It's me, Doyle.

1020
01:23:16,001 --> 01:23:18,253
You guys, I cannot believe that we survived.

1021
01:23:19,337 --> 01:23:20,839
What are the odds?

1022
01:23:24,968 --> 01:23:26,261
Morgan?

1023
01:23:26,428 --> 01:23:27,779
Yeah?

1024
01:23:27,929 --> 01:23:29,681
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1025
01:23:33,852 --> 01:23:35,478
Get down!

1026
01:23:42,068 --> 01:23:44,154
Shoot him you fucking idiots!

1027
01:25:07,112 --> 01:25:08,738
What the fuck?

1028
01:25:18,706 --> 01:25:20,291
We got one more for ya.

1029
01:25:20,458 --> 01:25:22,168
All right, hurry up, bring her in.
