1
00:01:32,678 --> 00:01:35,514
Hot and hazy weather,
with temperatures reaching into the 90s,

2
00:01:35,614 --> 00:01:37,616
is expected to continue
throughout the weekend

3
00:01:37,716 --> 00:01:39,651
over most of the Southland.

4
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:43,722
WORZ news time, 12:00.
Good evening, I'm Don Herbert.

5
00:01:43,822 --> 00:01:45,491
Tonight's lead story is the daring

6
00:01:45,591 --> 00:01:48,660
and deadly paramilitary robbery
at Camp Pendleton.

7
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,097
It left three marines dead and
at least nine others critically wounded.

8
00:01:52,197 --> 00:01:54,466
Earlier this evening,
a heavily armed commando unit

9
00:01:54,566 --> 00:01:56,101
held up the payroll office at the base

10
00:01:56,201 --> 00:01:58,837
and fled with $3.5 million.

11
00:01:58,937 --> 00:02:01,373
The robbers exchanged gunfire
with military police

12
00:02:01,473 --> 00:02:03,475
as they raced to a nearby airfield

13
00:02:03,575 --> 00:02:05,944
and then escaped
in a twin-engine cargo plane.

14
00:02:06,044 --> 00:02:09,248
The pilot and his teenage daughter
are believed to be held hostage

15
00:02:09,348 --> 00:02:12,551
- on board the Baja Air...
- Turn that bloody radio off.

16
00:02:12,651 --> 00:02:14,674
...was hijacked...

17
00:02:20,626 --> 00:02:23,028
It's okay, Daxie. It's okay.

18
00:02:23,128 --> 00:02:25,964
Here, keep it under radar.

19
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:28,033
You heard the man.

20
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:31,270
An intensive manhunt is underway
as marine helicopter units

21
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,640
track down the stolen craft
which was reported heading south,

22
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,731
presumably towards the border.

23
00:03:33,198 --> 00:03:35,428
All right, I'll take care of it.

24
00:03:53,485 --> 00:03:55,009
Hey, Roxanne.

25
00:04:12,504 --> 00:04:13,972
- Where's the fire?
- Back here.

26
00:04:14,072 --> 00:04:16,666
- Hey, somebody...
- Bert's taking the money!

27
00:04:21,313 --> 00:04:23,715
Stop shooting, Curry.
He tossed a grenade.

28
00:04:23,815 --> 00:04:26,118
Fuck, it's somewhere in here.
I'll kill him.

29
00:04:26,218 --> 00:04:29,288
- Where is it?
- Pull up! Pull up, we're too low!

30
00:04:29,388 --> 00:04:30,753
Hold on.

31
00:04:34,926 --> 00:04:37,095
- The grenade.
- Watch out, it's rolling back.

32
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:38,830
Jack!

33
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,465
Jack!

34
00:04:40,565 --> 00:04:42,123
Throw it out!

35
00:04:48,607 --> 00:04:50,609
- The money?
- The money is gone.

36
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:52,844
Get ready to jump,
we're going after him.

37
00:04:52,944 --> 00:04:55,514
- Where's the money?
- It's gone!

38
00:04:55,614 --> 00:04:56,848
What happened to Bert?

39
00:04:56,948 --> 00:04:58,951
He bailed with the money, dumb ass.

40
00:04:59,051 --> 00:05:00,852
I saw a house back there
where he jumped.

41
00:05:00,952 --> 00:05:02,854
- We'll be back, Bert.
- Yeah.

42
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:05,047
We'll be back, Bert.

43
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:22,741
The plane? Where's the...

44
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:26,242
Wait, my grenade exploded. I heard it.

45
00:06:11,123 --> 00:06:14,960
All right, all right, put it together.

46
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,791
The money. I was right behind it.

47
00:06:19,698 --> 00:06:24,101
Then it dropped by these crosses,
like a graveyard.

48
00:06:55,934 --> 00:06:59,037
Jesus, a scarecrow.

49
00:06:59,137 --> 00:07:00,968
Bloody scarecrow.

50
00:07:08,847 --> 00:07:12,951
I'll be damned, the graveyard.

51
00:07:13,051 --> 00:07:16,455
The money's got to be there.

52
00:07:16,555 --> 00:07:18,924
All right, the house.

53
00:07:19,024 --> 00:07:22,461
There's gotta be a car or a jeep
or something there I can use.

54
00:07:22,561 --> 00:07:24,529
Where the bloody hell...

55
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:26,164
Bingo!

56
00:07:26,264 --> 00:07:28,164
My lucky night.

57
00:07:37,008 --> 00:07:39,841
Bingo, my lucky night.

58
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,447
What the hell is down there, Corbin?

59
00:07:42,547 --> 00:07:43,782
Trees and bushes.

60
00:07:43,882 --> 00:07:46,418
Great, let's find that house again.

61
00:07:46,518 --> 00:07:49,180
That's where he'll go, the simple fuck.

62
00:07:53,992 --> 00:07:55,894
I spotted it.

63
00:07:55,994 --> 00:07:58,096
Closing 11 o'clock.

64
00:07:58,196 --> 00:08:01,131
It's the house all right,
looks pretty dead.

65
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,126
Over there.

66
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:55,887
Hey, Bert, old buddy. Reading me?

67
00:08:55,987 --> 00:09:00,859
That's right, you no-good, double-crossing,
scum-sucking son of a bitch.

68
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,961
We are alive.

69
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:04,629
Damn it, I can't believe it.

70
00:09:04,729 --> 00:09:07,599
- Jack, what's wrong?
- I dropped my harmonica.

71
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:10,569
You can blow Bert's balls off.
Come on, let's find him.

72
00:09:10,669 --> 00:09:13,570
All right, Bert. Now it's personal.

73
00:09:30,922 --> 00:09:33,015
- Bang.
- I'm dead.

74
00:11:08,653 --> 00:11:13,158
By the way, Bert, buddy,
we owe you a live grenade, pal.

75
00:11:13,258 --> 00:11:15,460
We'll nail you up like one
of these scarecrows.

76
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,894
Then we're gonna burn you, Bert,
just like you burned us, motherfucker.

77
00:11:53,465 --> 00:11:55,767
- Hold it, I saw a light.
- Where?

78
00:11:55,867 --> 00:11:58,358
By the house, a car, maybe.

79
00:11:59,237 --> 00:12:01,171
You're crow shit, Bert.

80
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,978
God to Bert, your birthday's
been canceled.

81
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:09,914
Hey, Corb, hope you didn't
forget your buffalo gun.

82
00:12:10,014 --> 00:12:12,484
- She's right here.
- That's too cruel, man.

83
00:12:12,584 --> 00:12:14,853
That's the gun
with the exploding shells.

84
00:12:14,953 --> 00:12:17,122
And, Bert, this ammo is blessed.

85
00:12:17,222 --> 00:12:21,955
So, when I blow your ass away, buddy,
every piece of you is going straight to hell.

86
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,081
Over there, the lights, they're moving.

87
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:44,349
Where?

88
00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:46,284
- Come in.
- It's a truck.

89
00:12:46,384 --> 00:12:49,421
Southeast of you. It's gotta be Bert.
Move.

90
00:12:49,521 --> 00:12:51,956
The cornfield.
He's going after the money.

91
00:12:52,056 --> 00:12:54,159
Rox, your transmission's breaking up.

92
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:57,195
Curry, Jack, come in. Where are you?

93
00:12:57,295 --> 00:13:00,031
Damn it. We're out of range.

94
00:13:00,131 --> 00:13:04,124
Hey, Bert, you dumb fuck,
there's only one road and we're on it.

95
00:13:35,366 --> 00:13:37,664
This isn't exactly Route 66, is it?

96
00:13:39,804 --> 00:13:41,465
Here, hold this, will you?

97
00:13:42,473 --> 00:13:44,134
It says keep out.

98
00:13:45,476 --> 00:13:47,444
Will you just hold this?

99
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:55,220
Come on out here, Bert,
you son of a bitch.

100
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,051
I'm gonna rip your heart out
and feed it to you on a stick.

101
00:14:00,391 --> 00:14:02,552
- Give me that.
- Here.

102
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:12,504
- What's in there?
- The Playboy Mansion.

103
00:14:12,604 --> 00:14:15,402
- That's it?
- Scarecrows.

104
00:14:18,176 --> 00:14:19,310
Scarecrows.

105
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:22,280
- Jack, Curry, come in.
- We're here.

106
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,183
Bert's heading for the gate.
Are you guys on that road?

107
00:14:25,283 --> 00:14:27,285
- Yeah.
- Well, stay on it.

108
00:14:27,385 --> 00:14:29,487
He's gonna have to come
through you guys.

109
00:14:29,587 --> 00:14:30,747
Here.

110
00:14:35,126 --> 00:14:38,152
Coming to get you, Bert,
you son of a bitch.

111
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,771
Good job.

112
00:14:46,871 --> 00:14:49,965
Come on, Jack.
Heaven can't wait for you.

113
00:14:54,212 --> 00:14:55,406
Heaven?

114
00:14:56,481 --> 00:15:00,251
Graveyard has gotta be on this road.

115
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,649
There. There it is.

116
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,552
Can't you fly this crate any faster?

117
00:16:07,652 --> 00:16:08,720
I'm in full throttle.

118
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,188
He picked up the money.
He's getting away.

119
00:16:10,288 --> 00:16:11,489
You're pathetic.

120
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:14,192
Should I splatter your face
around the cockpit or what?

121
00:16:14,292 --> 00:16:16,728
There he is. Swing around and get him.

122
00:16:16,828 --> 00:16:18,557
Swing around again.

123
00:16:25,436 --> 00:16:27,038
He's headed your way, guys.

124
00:16:27,138 --> 00:16:30,608
- Which way is that?
- Behind us or in front of us?

125
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,938
Stupid assholes.

126
00:16:36,614 --> 00:16:39,117
Damn, he's turning off the road.

127
00:16:39,217 --> 00:16:40,818
I'm coming down.

128
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:43,113
Look for a place to land.

129
00:16:45,356 --> 00:16:47,659
This terrain's for shit.
We can't land down here.

130
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,027
We're landing.

131
00:16:49,127 --> 00:16:53,154
- You'll never make it. Never!
- Kellie, stay out of this.

132
00:16:54,966 --> 00:16:58,369
You know, Bert, we were kind of
hoping you were coming down that road

133
00:16:58,469 --> 00:17:00,605
to give us back our money
and straighten things out,

134
00:17:00,705 --> 00:17:03,174
but you let us down again.

135
00:17:03,274 --> 00:17:05,877
Now you've gone too far, dirtball.

136
00:17:05,977 --> 00:17:09,743
Yeah, Bert, I think I'm gonna
have to cut you out of my will.

137
00:17:13,818 --> 00:17:16,150
God damn, now what?

138
00:17:20,491 --> 00:17:22,627
The tank's full.

139
00:17:22,727 --> 00:17:24,888
The fucking thing's flooded.

140
00:17:33,304 --> 00:17:34,737
What the...

141
00:17:36,107 --> 00:17:39,042
No engine? Wait a minute.

142
00:17:40,745 --> 00:17:42,347
This is impossible.

143
00:17:42,447 --> 00:17:44,215
What is this?

144
00:17:44,315 --> 00:17:46,476
Some kind of fucking joke?

145
00:17:54,459 --> 00:17:57,862
Listen up, guys. Bert's stopped the truck.
I can't tell what he's up to.

146
00:17:57,962 --> 00:18:01,265
But he's on foot now,
about a half mile west of the house.

147
00:18:01,365 --> 00:18:04,402
We're almost there.
I can smell him, he's toast.

148
00:18:04,502 --> 00:18:08,373
No, take him alive. The first bullet
through his head is mine.

149
00:18:08,473 --> 00:18:10,998
We're landing this sucker right now.

150
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:17,276
There's a field at 4 o'clock.

151
00:18:19,784 --> 00:18:21,319
It may be long enough.

152
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:22,854
So, how's it feel, Bert?

153
00:18:22,954 --> 00:18:24,989
I mean, it must be awful frustrating

154
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:28,126
to have to die
with all that money in your hands.

155
00:18:28,226 --> 00:18:31,059
Yeah, real frustrating.

156
00:18:37,502 --> 00:18:39,604
That money must be getting awful heavy.

157
00:18:39,704 --> 00:18:42,507
$3.5 million is a lot
of bread for one guy.

158
00:18:42,607 --> 00:18:44,542
It ain't right to be so greedy.

159
00:18:44,642 --> 00:18:46,811
All right, asshole,
just hold it right there.

160
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,780
- You see him?
- Shut up.

161
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,516
Oh, yeah, yeah. There he is.

162
00:18:51,616 --> 00:18:54,519
Hey, Bert, we're gonna hang you up
like one of these scarecrows

163
00:18:54,619 --> 00:18:56,254
and stuff you full of crow shit.

164
00:18:56,354 --> 00:18:59,157
Hey, Corbin, start bagging
some crow turds.

165
00:18:59,257 --> 00:19:03,294
He didn't hear you, man. He's into
his jungles and Rambo bullshit.

166
00:19:03,394 --> 00:19:04,729
With his radio turned off, right?

167
00:19:04,829 --> 00:19:08,731
Whoa, there he is again.
I got him on my scope. Don't move.

168
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:11,669
Stand still, Bert.

169
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:14,372
Just one second, it'll all be over.

170
00:19:14,472 --> 00:19:16,741
Turn around, Bert.
I wanna shoot you in the back.

171
00:19:16,841 --> 00:19:18,369
Over here.

172
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,170
Where is he?

173
00:19:27,685 --> 00:19:28,820
He's coming toward us.

174
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,923
Keep coming, Bert.
You're heading right for me.

175
00:19:32,023 --> 00:19:34,082
I don't even have to move.

176
00:19:35,026 --> 00:19:37,551
Over here, Bert, towards your left.

177
00:19:38,229 --> 00:19:41,199
- Pretty lousy shooting.
- Bert's aim always sucked.

178
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:43,334
Everything he did sucked.

179
00:19:43,434 --> 00:19:46,267
Now we're both
right behind you, asshole.

180
00:20:07,358 --> 00:20:10,819
We got you covered, Bert,
from behind these scarecrows.

181
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:18,391
Put the gun down.
You're not going to hurt us.

182
00:20:20,671 --> 00:20:21,899
Curry?

183
00:20:23,407 --> 00:20:24,533
Jack?

184
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,546
Curry? Jack?

185
00:20:28,646 --> 00:20:32,517
Look, you want the money? Take it.

186
00:20:32,617 --> 00:20:33,777
Curry!

187
00:20:34,518 --> 00:20:36,354
Jack! Take the money.

188
00:20:36,454 --> 00:20:38,322
Please, don't kill me.

189
00:20:38,422 --> 00:20:40,322
Who's he talking to, Curry?

190
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,828
Curry? Jack?

191
00:20:43,928 --> 00:20:46,397
Look, take it.

192
00:20:46,497 --> 00:20:49,767
We don't want your money.
We want your blood, Bert.

193
00:20:49,867 --> 00:20:52,970
Do you want me to run?
Well, I'm not going to, see?

194
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,306
Running's over, Bert.
It's time to bleed.

195
00:20:55,406 --> 00:20:58,075
Like those MPs with their guts
spilling on the runway.

196
00:20:58,175 --> 00:21:00,611
Time to bleed, Bert.

197
00:21:00,711 --> 00:21:03,848
Look, I'm not even carrying a weapon.

198
00:21:03,948 --> 00:21:06,117
Start praying, Bert.

199
00:21:06,217 --> 00:21:08,719
Look, you want the money?

200
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:12,490
Well, you can't have it
'cause I've hid it.

201
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,751
So, let's make a deal.

202
00:21:23,868 --> 00:21:26,704
Bert, why don't you say something,
motherfucker?

203
00:21:26,804 --> 00:21:29,307
Come on, scumbag, talk.

204
00:21:29,407 --> 00:21:31,832
Words of wisdom from a dying man.

205
00:22:49,487 --> 00:22:52,423
...your seatbelt, move. Come on.

206
00:22:52,523 --> 00:22:53,891
Christ, leave her out of this.

207
00:22:53,991 --> 00:22:55,856
- Daddy, stop them...
- Shut up.

208
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,719
Get the ladder down now.

209
00:23:02,233 --> 00:23:05,303
- Look, I'm asking you...
- Don't be a hero, Daddy.

210
00:23:05,403 --> 00:23:07,371
Get the ladder, now!

211
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:12,269
Look,

212
00:23:14,478 --> 00:23:17,181
keep your ass on that seat.

213
00:23:17,281 --> 00:23:20,216
No radios,
nothing's going to happen to her.

214
00:23:24,488 --> 00:23:26,217
Come on, let's go.

215
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,898
- Hey, Curry.
- What?

216
00:23:33,998 --> 00:23:36,901
How am I gonna live in Mexico
if I don't speak Spanish?

217
00:23:37,001 --> 00:23:39,603
I told you a hundred times, Paco,
I'm gonna teach you.

218
00:23:39,703 --> 00:23:41,796
You're a real pal, amigo.

219
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:51,875
Lovely.

220
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,113
Hey, the lights are on now.

221
00:24:04,328 --> 00:24:08,264
- What the hell is that?
- Guess we're expected.

222
00:24:23,814 --> 00:24:26,044
This is some creepy shit, man.

223
00:24:37,962 --> 00:24:39,190
Hold it.

224
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:42,199
Looks like we missed the party.

225
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:43,334
Bert.

226
00:24:43,434 --> 00:24:46,003
Yeah. Check out the inside, will you?

227
00:24:46,103 --> 00:24:48,272
Somebody lives here.

228
00:24:48,372 --> 00:24:52,143
Not anymore, they don't.
Come on, check it out inside.

229
00:24:52,243 --> 00:24:54,575
Bullshit, man, you check it out.

230
00:24:55,946 --> 00:24:58,182
You're always
such a fucking pain in the ass.

231
00:24:58,282 --> 00:25:00,182
What am I, your mother?

232
00:25:05,823 --> 00:25:07,154
Hey, Bert.

233
00:27:32,936 --> 00:27:36,206
- Christ, you think about knocking?
- Knock, knock.

234
00:27:36,306 --> 00:27:37,708
Asshole.

235
00:27:37,808 --> 00:27:39,173
It's Rambo.

236
00:27:40,344 --> 00:27:42,446
Is that you, Corbin?

237
00:27:42,546 --> 00:27:44,582
Get down here.

238
00:27:44,682 --> 00:27:46,283
I'm gonna look for Bert.

239
00:27:46,383 --> 00:27:51,755
I'll tell you, whoever lives or who
lived here was very fucking weird.

240
00:27:51,855 --> 00:27:54,325
Into devil worship or some shit.

241
00:27:54,425 --> 00:27:57,761
Hey, guys, I'm coming up the trail.
I can see the house.

242
00:27:57,861 --> 00:27:59,396
Who lives here?

243
00:27:59,496 --> 00:28:01,632
Mailbox says "Fowler. ""

244
00:28:01,732 --> 00:28:03,801
There's a picture
of three very mangy guys.

245
00:28:03,901 --> 00:28:06,003
Bert could have killed them
but there's no bodies,

246
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:08,572
just some very ugly vibes.

247
00:28:08,672 --> 00:28:11,008
Slow down, I'm getting
stickers everywhere.

248
00:28:11,108 --> 00:28:13,042
You'll live. Come on.

249
00:28:30,094 --> 00:28:32,892
Let me go. I'm not going anywhere.

250
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:38,732
Where's Jack?

251
00:28:39,303 --> 00:28:41,430
Jack's still up on the roof.

252
00:28:43,574 --> 00:28:47,277
Hey, Jack, come on down here, will you?

253
00:28:47,377 --> 00:28:50,481
- Yo, Jack.
- I found it, the parachute.

254
00:28:50,581 --> 00:28:52,316
- Jackpot! Where?
- At least one of them.

255
00:28:52,416 --> 00:28:56,020
- Where is it, Jack?
- It's by these three big crosses.

256
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,356
That's weird,
there's no scarecrows on them.

257
00:28:59,456 --> 00:29:01,151
Great, what else?

258
00:29:09,767 --> 00:29:10,901
Shit.

259
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:13,469
Come on, get down here, will you?

260
00:29:15,105 --> 00:29:16,440
For Christ's sake.

261
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:19,376
I saw a scarecrow, out there somewhere.

262
00:29:19,476 --> 00:29:21,478
Jack, where's the parachute?

263
00:29:21,578 --> 00:29:23,447
No, no, the scarecrow thing, it was...

264
00:29:23,547 --> 00:29:26,417
Come on, they're everywhere.
They're all over the place. Give me this.

265
00:29:26,517 --> 00:29:29,353
Jack, the parachute?

266
00:29:29,453 --> 00:29:33,446
Yeah, it was by these crosses.
You can see it from the roof.

267
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:42,933
Come on, we're wasting time.
The whole damn army's looking for us.

268
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:45,302
We'll follow Bert's
tire tracks out front.

269
00:29:45,402 --> 00:29:46,904
I'll stay with the girl.

270
00:29:47,004 --> 00:29:48,605
Let's go, Jack.

271
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:51,833
Get away from there
before a scarecrow grabs you, huh?

272
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:01,741
Bert ran over this one.

273
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,823
Come on, let's go.

274
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,701
Curry, do you get the feeling

275
00:30:17,801 --> 00:30:19,336
- we're being watched?
- No.

276
00:30:19,436 --> 00:30:21,505
Then how come your finger's
on the trigger?

277
00:30:21,605 --> 00:30:23,240
Shut up, asshole.

278
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:26,143
I think this place is possessed
by demonic demons.

279
00:30:26,243 --> 00:30:30,407
Your head's gonna be possessed
by the butt of my gun if you don't shut up.

280
00:36:12,889 --> 00:36:15,619
WORZ news time, 3:01.

281
00:36:29,172 --> 00:36:30,640
My luck.

282
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,642
I don't like this one bit, Curry.

283
00:36:32,742 --> 00:36:34,945
We're being set up bigger than shit.
I can feel it.

284
00:36:35,045 --> 00:36:37,914
Well, take your hand out of
your pocket and stop feeling it.

285
00:36:38,014 --> 00:36:39,549
Come on, these are his footprints.

286
00:36:39,649 --> 00:36:42,786
Which ones? These or these?

287
00:36:42,886 --> 00:36:45,155
These, the boot prints.

288
00:36:45,255 --> 00:36:48,058
Then who made the other ones?
They're just as fresh.

289
00:36:48,158 --> 00:36:50,894
Fuck, I don't know, Jack.
Your damn scarecrow, all right?

290
00:36:50,994 --> 00:36:53,155
Is that what you want to hear?

291
00:36:58,802 --> 00:36:59,996
Look.

292
00:37:00,804 --> 00:37:03,173
Hey, there it is. Right there, look.

293
00:37:03,273 --> 00:37:04,774
- There it is.
- What?

294
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:08,011
The money, you idiot.
Now, go on up and get it.

295
00:37:08,111 --> 00:37:11,114
- What the hell is that?
- Bert's chute.

296
00:37:11,214 --> 00:37:12,449
It's the money.

297
00:37:12,549 --> 00:37:15,752
Now, for Christ's sake,
go on up and cut it down.

298
00:37:15,852 --> 00:37:19,754
- You cut it down.
- Jack, just go up and cut it down.

299
00:37:21,825 --> 00:37:24,060
You cover me.
If anything happens to me...

300
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,720
Yeah, yeah. Come on, let's have it.

301
00:37:39,876 --> 00:37:42,112
Come on, cut it.

302
00:37:42,212 --> 00:37:46,308
For Christ's sake, just cut it, will you?
Come on, pennies from heaven.

303
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,721
Jack!

304
00:37:51,821 --> 00:37:53,721
Shit!

305
00:37:55,058 --> 00:37:56,753
Jesus Christ!

306
00:38:04,034 --> 00:38:05,228
Curry?

307
00:38:08,772 --> 00:38:10,173
Curry?

308
00:38:10,273 --> 00:38:13,577
We're on the way back to the house.
Curry's not feeling too good.

309
00:38:13,677 --> 00:38:15,378
Bert's not gonna feel too good either

310
00:38:15,478 --> 00:38:16,746
- when I find him.
- What?

311
00:38:16,846 --> 00:38:19,416
Bert booby-trapped his chute
with some blood and stuff.

312
00:38:19,516 --> 00:38:22,085
And now it's all over me,
Bert, funny man,

313
00:38:22,185 --> 00:38:25,522
Like I'm gonna be all over you
when I find you, you motherfucker.

314
00:38:25,622 --> 00:38:28,792
- Chill out, Curry.
- You're a dead man, Bert.

315
00:38:28,892 --> 00:38:32,028
A corpse, you hear me, Bert? A dead man.

316
00:38:32,128 --> 00:38:34,426
- Curry, we'll find him.
- Dead!

317
00:39:10,033 --> 00:39:11,660
That's too weird.

318
00:39:25,782 --> 00:39:26,908
Bert!

319
00:39:31,621 --> 00:39:33,623
- Curry.
- What the hell is it?

320
00:39:33,723 --> 00:39:34,991
- He's here.
- What?

321
00:39:35,091 --> 00:39:36,326
Bert's at the house.

322
00:39:36,426 --> 00:39:39,054
There is a God. Coming right up.

323
00:39:42,198 --> 00:39:44,029
Fuck him up, come on.

324
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:50,340
Stop your bullshit games, man,
you tried to fuck us.

325
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,342
Now, where's the goddamn money?

326
00:39:52,442 --> 00:39:55,345
Bert, we're gonna get it out of you,
one way or another.

327
00:39:55,445 --> 00:39:56,912
Where is it?

328
00:40:01,151 --> 00:40:02,752
Let's just start with his hand, huh?

329
00:40:02,852 --> 00:40:05,855
Let's just start
with his goddamn fingers.

330
00:40:05,955 --> 00:40:08,185
Who were you shooting at, huh?

331
00:40:09,526 --> 00:40:11,187
Where's the money?

332
00:40:13,096 --> 00:40:15,087
What's your goddamn name?

333
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:19,862
Stop it, you're killing him!

334
00:40:23,606 --> 00:40:26,439
- Stop it!
- Change her diaper, will you?

335
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:35,550
You stay out of it.

336
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,895
Jack, where have you been?

337
00:40:45,995 --> 00:40:49,332
Found some green stalks
down by the stream. Hungry?

338
00:40:49,432 --> 00:40:51,534
Motherfucker, you planned this heist,

339
00:40:51,634 --> 00:40:54,471
and you planned to double-cross us
right from day fucking one.

340
00:40:54,571 --> 00:40:57,073
Come on, harder.

341
00:40:57,173 --> 00:40:58,808
Piece of shit.

342
00:40:58,908 --> 00:41:02,746
All that time you were just
jacking us off with sandpaper. Kick his ass.

343
00:41:02,846 --> 00:41:07,283
Hey, there, want an ear?
Best way to eat corn.

344
00:41:07,383 --> 00:41:10,387
Get away from me,
you cold-blooded bastard, just get away!

345
00:41:10,487 --> 00:41:12,887
Look, leave her alone, Jack, okay?

346
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,327
Sack of shit. I'll watch him.

347
00:41:22,732 --> 00:41:24,962
- He's a dead end.
- Man.

348
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,443
We're gonna have to sweep the area.

349
00:41:33,543 --> 00:41:36,613
We'll get it back,
that double-crossing scum.

350
00:41:36,713 --> 00:41:39,883
I've never seen anybody
stand a beating like Bert just did.

351
00:41:39,983 --> 00:41:41,518
He hardly even bled.

352
00:41:41,618 --> 00:41:44,154
Maybe he got a concussion
or something when he landed.

353
00:41:44,254 --> 00:41:45,388
He must have because he was numb

354
00:41:45,488 --> 00:41:47,590
even before I started
smashing his skull in.

355
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:49,192
I don't think he can even talk.

356
00:41:49,292 --> 00:41:50,360
I don't buy it.

357
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,362
I think the son of a bitch
took some drugs or something,

358
00:41:52,462 --> 00:41:54,931
then walked in here hoping
we'd kick his ass and leave him for dead.

359
00:41:55,031 --> 00:41:56,599
Leaving him with all the money.

360
00:41:56,699 --> 00:41:58,401
He knew we'd find him
dragging that cash around,

361
00:41:58,501 --> 00:42:00,804
so he stashed it
and took his chances coming up here.

362
00:42:00,904 --> 00:42:02,172
So now the fucker is laughing at us

363
00:42:02,272 --> 00:42:04,641
'cause he fried his brain
and we can't get to him.

364
00:42:04,741 --> 00:42:05,775
Well, the joke's on him

365
00:42:05,875 --> 00:42:08,378
'cause I'm gonna be standing on his dick
when he comes out of it.

366
00:42:08,478 --> 00:42:10,313
He's just sitting there mocking us.

367
00:42:10,413 --> 00:42:12,015
Right behind that face
he's laughing so hard

368
00:42:12,115 --> 00:42:14,549
he's going to bust out any moment.

369
00:42:20,156 --> 00:42:23,259
All right, asshole, where is it?

370
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,020
Forget it, Curry.

371
00:42:27,897 --> 00:42:29,626
What's the matter, Curry?

372
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,061
Can't you take it?

373
00:42:39,042 --> 00:42:40,634
Jack, help!

374
00:42:42,579 --> 00:42:44,347
Jack, over here! I'm stuck to this guy!

375
00:42:44,447 --> 00:42:45,915
Curry, move! Get out of the way!

376
00:42:46,015 --> 00:42:48,040
God damn it, move! Move!

377
00:42:53,456 --> 00:42:54,457
Son of a bitch!

378
00:42:54,557 --> 00:42:56,115
Corbin, hurry!

379
00:43:00,897 --> 00:43:04,367
Curry! Corbin!
Help me, guys! He's not real!

380
00:43:04,467 --> 00:43:06,264
Bastard, put him down!

381
00:43:26,656 --> 00:43:30,059
Jack! Jack, get up!

382
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:32,328
Corbin, we're gonna go...

383
00:43:32,428 --> 00:43:33,759
Watch out!

384
00:43:35,732 --> 00:43:37,367
Shoot him, Roxanne! Shoot him!

385
00:43:37,467 --> 00:43:39,401
Out of the way, Corbin!

386
00:44:06,963 --> 00:44:09,898
He's not real, man.
What the hell was he on?

387
00:44:18,408 --> 00:44:20,899
Holy fuck, he's light as a feather.

388
00:44:22,912 --> 00:44:24,709
Cut him open, Corbin.

389
00:44:34,691 --> 00:44:36,716
God, I'm gonna be sick.

390
00:44:41,397 --> 00:44:43,266
No wonder he's so light.

391
00:44:43,366 --> 00:44:45,635
There's nothing in him
except straw and...

392
00:44:45,735 --> 00:44:46,936
Bingo.

393
00:44:47,036 --> 00:44:48,367
The money.

394
00:44:49,038 --> 00:44:52,804
- He ate the goddamn money.
- Hey, Kellie, she's gone, man.

395
00:44:53,443 --> 00:44:54,535
Damn.

396
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:57,246
Damn!

397
00:44:57,346 --> 00:45:00,179
Corbin, go get her!
Don't let them take off!

398
00:45:06,055 --> 00:45:09,125
This is bullshit, man.
We should be taking off.

399
00:45:09,225 --> 00:45:12,161
You think Bert ate that money?
You're all fucking crazy.

400
00:45:12,261 --> 00:45:15,865
Somebody out there gutted Bert
like a fish and stuffed him full of cash.

401
00:45:15,965 --> 00:45:19,594
Your brains are gutted, dick.
How the hell did he kick our asses?

402
00:45:32,348 --> 00:45:33,975
Kellie!

403
00:45:35,785 --> 00:45:37,587
Kellie!

404
00:45:37,687 --> 00:45:38,755
Help me.

405
00:45:38,855 --> 00:45:40,880
Honey, please help me.

406
00:45:44,794 --> 00:45:46,193
Oh, Kellie!

407
00:45:48,364 --> 00:45:49,866
Please help me.

408
00:45:49,966 --> 00:45:51,331
Kellie!

409
00:45:54,504 --> 00:45:57,473
It's Daddy, Kellie. Help me.

410
00:46:00,176 --> 00:46:01,438
Oh, God!

411
00:46:10,353 --> 00:46:11,547
Daddy!

412
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:27,036
This isn't all of it, you know.

413
00:46:27,136 --> 00:46:29,372
It isn't nearly all of it.

414
00:46:29,472 --> 00:46:31,406
It's hardly any of it.

415
00:46:37,613 --> 00:46:38,944
What if...

416
00:46:40,349 --> 00:46:44,080
You know, whoever lives here,
what if they did that to Bert,

417
00:46:45,521 --> 00:46:47,290
and they're waiting outside do it to us?

418
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:49,292
Why don't you just shut up?

419
00:46:49,392 --> 00:46:50,727
And what if those crosses...

420
00:46:50,827 --> 00:46:54,263
"What if? What if? What if?""
Why don't you just shut up?

421
00:46:56,399 --> 00:46:59,095
Look, let's get out of here.

422
00:47:01,671 --> 00:47:04,367
Let's take the money we have and split.

423
00:47:05,308 --> 00:47:08,368
Bert was walking around dead,
for Christ's sake.

424
00:47:13,349 --> 00:47:15,977
We've got to refrigerate this,
it stinks.

425
00:47:17,019 --> 00:47:18,486
You know,

426
00:47:20,356 --> 00:47:23,223
somebody is trying
to scare us out of here

427
00:47:24,293 --> 00:47:26,318
so they can get the money.

428
00:47:27,697 --> 00:47:29,824
And we are not leaving now.

429
00:47:30,566 --> 00:47:31,828
No way.

430
00:47:33,436 --> 00:47:35,529
We've come this far.

431
00:47:35,638 --> 00:47:38,300
We are not leaving without that money.

432
00:47:51,153 --> 00:47:53,422
You bitch! God damn you!

433
00:47:53,522 --> 00:47:54,853
Al's dead.

434
00:47:55,358 --> 00:47:57,451
Somebody out there killed her father,

435
00:47:58,527 --> 00:48:00,051
just like Bert.

436
00:48:03,266 --> 00:48:04,867
You killed him!

437
00:48:04,967 --> 00:48:06,696
You all killed him.

438
00:48:18,948 --> 00:48:21,576
Is she gonna be able
to fly us out of here?

439
00:48:22,451 --> 00:48:23,816
She has to.

440
00:48:44,106 --> 00:48:45,198
Hey.

441
00:48:46,175 --> 00:48:47,301
Hey!

442
00:48:49,812 --> 00:48:50,836
Hey!

443
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:52,706
Look!

444
00:48:53,516 --> 00:48:55,885
Oh, my God. The money.

445
00:48:55,985 --> 00:48:58,754
It must have been in a tree
or something and the wind blew it down.

446
00:48:58,854 --> 00:49:01,757
There's no way the money
spread like that off a tree.

447
00:49:01,857 --> 00:49:05,094
It must have got caught in an air current
or a wind or something.

448
00:49:05,194 --> 00:49:08,097
- Let's get it.
- And get the hell out of here.

449
00:49:08,197 --> 00:49:11,334
The hell with you guys.
I'm gonna bury her dad.

450
00:49:11,434 --> 00:49:13,527
That's the least we can do.

451
00:49:26,248 --> 00:49:29,552
- Don't get too far away, will you?
- Yeah, right.

452
00:49:29,652 --> 00:49:31,954
If you see anything
that moves, shoot it.

453
00:49:32,054 --> 00:49:34,113
I wish I had my harmonica.

454
00:49:44,633 --> 00:49:46,903
Take the path to your left there.

455
00:49:47,003 --> 00:49:48,838
Yo, Roxanne, we're splitting up.

456
00:49:48,938 --> 00:49:51,407
The money is concentrated
in two separate areas.

457
00:49:51,507 --> 00:49:53,338
We'll get it faster.

458
00:50:54,637 --> 00:50:55,972
I'll be damned.

459
00:50:56,072 --> 00:50:58,199
What? What's wrong, Jack?

460
00:51:02,912 --> 00:51:04,504
You're kidding.

461
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:09,308
Where are you?

462
00:51:18,761 --> 00:51:21,197
Okay, slow down. I can't see you.

463
00:51:21,297 --> 00:51:23,265
You hear me, jerk?

464
00:51:23,699 --> 00:51:25,189
Jack, wait up.

465
00:51:25,634 --> 00:51:26,760
Jack.

466
00:51:27,403 --> 00:51:28,495
Jack!

467
00:51:29,305 --> 00:51:30,897
Come in, Paco.

468
00:51:45,554 --> 00:51:46,680
Jack?

469
00:51:48,324 --> 00:51:49,658
Jack!

470
00:51:49,758 --> 00:51:51,427
I'm coming, Jack. I'm coming.

471
00:51:51,527 --> 00:51:52,561
- Which way?
- Curry?

472
00:51:52,661 --> 00:51:55,231
- Come on, talk to me, Jack! Which way?
- Jack?

473
00:51:55,331 --> 00:51:56,958
Come in, Jack!

474
00:51:57,933 --> 00:51:59,560
Hey, where are you guys?

475
00:52:00,002 --> 00:52:02,972
Hang on, buddy, I'm coming.
Oh, Jesus. I'm coming. Jack!

476
00:52:03,072 --> 00:52:06,242
What's happening? Jack? Curry?

477
00:52:06,342 --> 00:52:08,077
- Jack!
- Come in.

478
00:52:08,177 --> 00:52:10,702
Damn it, Curry. Where are you guys?

479
00:52:12,581 --> 00:52:13,912
This way, let's move.

480
00:52:17,019 --> 00:52:18,179
Jack!

481
00:52:23,225 --> 00:52:25,819
Jack, which way, man?

482
00:53:27,756 --> 00:53:28,848
Jack?

483
00:53:29,792 --> 00:53:31,020
Jackie?

484
00:53:39,635 --> 00:53:41,660
Jack, don't do this to me.

485
00:59:00,522 --> 00:59:01,580
Maybe

486
00:59:02,758 --> 00:59:04,350
we're dead.

487
00:59:07,062 --> 00:59:09,731
And we're not...
I mean, we're not really here.

488
00:59:09,831 --> 00:59:11,567
This isn't real.

489
00:59:11,667 --> 00:59:13,498
I mean, we're here,

490
00:59:14,202 --> 00:59:16,636
but none of this is really...

491
00:59:48,303 --> 00:59:50,328
- What was that?
- What?

492
00:59:55,410 --> 00:59:56,809
Who is that?

493
01:00:04,186 --> 01:00:05,821
Hey, man, he's here.

494
01:00:05,921 --> 01:00:09,118
Hey, Jack! Man, where've you been, huh?

495
01:00:12,527 --> 01:00:15,325
Oh, Jesus, man,
I thought you were toast.

496
01:00:16,965 --> 01:00:18,227
Hey, man, where are you?

497
01:00:20,769 --> 01:00:23,205
Curry, who the hell are you talking to?

498
01:00:23,305 --> 01:00:25,207
Jack, he's on the radio.
What, are you deaf?

499
01:00:25,307 --> 01:00:27,002
Hey, man, where're you at?

500
01:00:29,244 --> 01:00:31,109
I don't hear anything.

501
01:00:41,957 --> 01:00:44,084
What are you trying to pull?

502
01:00:46,928 --> 01:00:50,065
Look, Curry, let's get the hell
out of here right away, okay?

503
01:00:50,165 --> 01:00:52,100
We'll get the rest of the money
on the way to the plane.

504
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:53,760
No!

505
01:00:54,403 --> 01:00:57,472
Jack's on his way back to the house.
He's got the money.

506
01:00:57,572 --> 01:00:58,540
Jack is dead, man.

507
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,842
He's on his way back to the house
with the money!

508
01:01:00,942 --> 01:01:03,745
- The money is outside.
- You, shut up!

509
01:01:03,845 --> 01:01:07,076
Curry, look, if we don't leave
right now, they'll kill us.

510
01:01:08,016 --> 01:01:09,244
You go.

511
01:01:10,152 --> 01:01:12,054
Those things don't go down, man.

512
01:01:12,154 --> 01:01:15,057
Now Jack is on his way
back to the house,

513
01:01:15,157 --> 01:01:17,259
and I'm not leaving here without him.

514
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:20,195
Curry, Jack's not coming back.

515
01:01:20,295 --> 01:01:21,660
He's dead.

516
01:01:22,998 --> 01:01:25,728
What are you doing with Jack's gun, huh?

517
01:01:26,568 --> 01:01:27,636
I...

518
01:01:27,736 --> 01:01:31,773
How are we supposed to get out of here
if Jack doesn't have his gun?

519
01:01:31,873 --> 01:01:36,310
All right, Curry. I'll give it to you.
You give it to Jack, all right?

520
01:01:37,179 --> 01:01:38,510
All right.

521
01:01:40,315 --> 01:01:42,918
Now you just get out of here.

522
01:01:43,018 --> 01:01:46,355
We'll be fine. Me and Jack,
we don't need anybody else.

523
01:01:46,455 --> 01:01:47,889
Now you just get the hell out of here.

524
01:01:47,989 --> 01:01:49,758
- You serious?
- God damn right, I'm serious.

525
01:01:49,858 --> 01:01:51,259
- Let's get out of here, Kellie.
- Get out!

526
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:54,262
- Curry, come with us.
- Just get the hell out!

527
01:01:54,362 --> 01:01:56,990
- No trouble, man, no trouble.
- Get out.

528
01:01:58,033 --> 01:01:59,261
Get out.

529
01:02:00,035 --> 01:02:01,263
Get out!

530
01:02:02,571 --> 01:02:04,835
Come on, move it! Let's go, let's go!

531
01:02:06,241 --> 01:02:08,675
Come on, we can make it! Come on!

532
01:02:15,283 --> 01:02:17,252
It's Dax! They're hurting him!

533
01:02:17,352 --> 01:02:19,688
- Dax?
- Kellie, don't listen! It's not your dog!

534
01:02:19,788 --> 01:02:21,881
Don't listen! It's the scarecrows!

535
01:02:22,457 --> 01:02:23,725
Dax, I'm coming!

536
01:02:23,825 --> 01:02:26,028
- Kellie, come back, it's not Dax!
- No!

537
01:02:26,128 --> 01:02:27,629
- Come on, she's going after Dax!
- Kellie!

538
01:02:27,729 --> 01:02:29,464
- Don't hurt him!
- It can't!

539
01:02:29,564 --> 01:02:31,400
Stop! Kellie!

540
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,561
Daxie, I'm coming!

541
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:43,311
Daxie, where are you?

542
01:02:43,411 --> 01:02:45,777
- This way.
- I'm coming, Daxie!

543
01:02:49,885 --> 01:02:51,553
Look, I found more money.

544
01:02:51,653 --> 01:02:53,555
Forget the money. Come on, let's go.

545
01:02:53,655 --> 01:02:55,424
Come on, Roxanne. Forget the money.

546
01:02:55,524 --> 01:02:57,958
We're getting out of here. Come on!

547
01:03:00,796 --> 01:03:02,798
Kellie, we have to get to the plane!

548
01:03:02,898 --> 01:03:04,766
Come back, Kellie. Where are you?

549
01:03:04,866 --> 01:03:06,201
Kellie!

550
01:03:06,301 --> 01:03:08,770
Roxanne, we gotta make a run
for the plane now.

551
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:11,573
- I'll meet you there.
- Go there now. I gotta get Kellie.

552
01:03:11,673 --> 01:03:13,903
You hear me? Do it. Roxanne!

553
01:03:23,385 --> 01:03:24,477
Dax?

554
01:03:26,087 --> 01:03:27,145
Dax?

555
01:03:31,426 --> 01:03:32,886
Daxie?

556
01:04:24,212 --> 01:04:25,372
Daxie?

557
01:04:26,815 --> 01:04:27,873
Dax?

558
01:04:29,551 --> 01:04:30,711
Daxie?

559
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:33,844
Dax, come here.

560
01:04:34,422 --> 01:04:35,753
Come here.

561
01:04:52,974 --> 01:04:54,202
Daxie?

562
01:04:56,811 --> 01:04:57,869
Dax?

563
01:05:20,735 --> 01:05:23,135
Come on, your dog's at the plane.

564
01:05:24,472 --> 01:05:26,041
Roxanne?

565
01:05:26,141 --> 01:05:27,676
Come in, Roxanne.

566
01:05:27,776 --> 01:05:30,078
We're getting out of here right now.
Meet us at the plane.

567
01:05:30,178 --> 01:05:32,414
Just forget the damn money
and get to the plane.

568
01:05:32,514 --> 01:05:34,216
It's not worth it.
Do you hear me, Roxanne?

569
01:05:34,316 --> 01:05:36,785
Forget the goddamn money.
It's not worth it.

570
01:05:36,885 --> 01:05:40,412
Roxanne! Roxanne, come in! Roxanne!

571
01:06:11,486 --> 01:06:13,852
Hey, Jack. Cómo estás?

572
01:06:19,728 --> 01:06:21,286
Hey, Jack, man.

573
01:06:23,932 --> 01:06:25,866
You never grow up, huh?

574
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:30,237
Hey, Paco!

575
01:06:43,418 --> 01:06:45,113
There's the plane.

576
01:06:50,859 --> 01:06:52,087
Come on!

577
01:06:56,264 --> 01:06:57,432
Come on!

578
01:06:57,532 --> 01:06:58,760
Come on!

579
01:07:00,168 --> 01:07:01,937
Come on, let's go! Hurry up!

580
01:07:02,037 --> 01:07:04,072
Watch the wire. I got it. Go under!

581
01:07:04,172 --> 01:07:05,332
Go on!

582
01:07:13,515 --> 01:07:16,780
Fly the hell out of here, Kellie!
Hurry, get away!

583
01:07:18,219 --> 01:07:21,189
Run! Don't stop, Kellie! Run, run!

584
01:07:21,289 --> 01:07:23,223
Get out of here! Keep running!

585
01:08:15,977 --> 01:08:17,137
Jack?

586
01:08:20,615 --> 01:08:23,243
You fuck, you fall on me, you're dead.

587
01:08:57,051 --> 01:08:59,788
- Hello?
- Hello, Curry.

588
01:08:59,888 --> 01:09:02,914
- Hello?
- Over here, in the fridge.

589
01:09:05,226 --> 01:09:08,457
Reach out and touch someone.

590
01:09:28,183 --> 01:09:32,087
Well, who is it?

591
01:09:32,187 --> 01:09:33,313
Jack?

592
01:09:54,375 --> 01:09:55,399
Jack?

593
01:09:59,547 --> 01:10:02,983
Hey, Jack. Is that you, huh?

594
01:10:07,555 --> 01:10:09,887
Motherfucker, don't play games with me!

595
01:10:14,062 --> 01:10:15,154
Jack?

596
01:10:15,597 --> 01:10:17,155
Hey, Paco.

597
01:10:17,932 --> 01:10:19,229
It's me.

598
01:10:29,944 --> 01:10:32,811
I'm okay, let's go.
Let's get the hell out of here!

599
01:10:48,663 --> 01:10:50,865
Roxanne? Curry?

600
01:10:50,965 --> 01:10:54,002
Can you hear me? We're at the plane.

601
01:10:54,102 --> 01:10:55,537
- Hey, Curry.
- You can still make it if you come now.

602
01:10:55,637 --> 01:10:57,472
- How come you locked me out, man?
- This is your last chance.

603
01:10:57,572 --> 01:11:00,842
Let me in there, amigo.
There are scarecrows out here.

604
01:11:00,942 --> 01:11:04,045
Hurry up, Paco. They're getting closer.

605
01:11:04,145 --> 01:11:06,714
I'm not fooling around.
Let me in, Curry.

606
01:11:06,814 --> 01:11:09,918
Gee, these fucking things,
they're definitely demonic.

607
01:11:10,018 --> 01:11:12,887
Curry, you're not one of them,
are you, man?

608
01:11:12,987 --> 01:11:14,155
Tell me you're not.

609
01:11:14,255 --> 01:11:17,325
Curry, open the fucking door.
It's me, man. It's Jack.

610
01:11:17,425 --> 01:11:19,655
Open the goddamn fucking door!

611
01:11:35,777 --> 01:11:37,045
Hey, Curry,

612
01:11:37,145 --> 01:11:40,239
how are we gonna live in Mexico
if we're dead?

613
01:13:03,631 --> 01:13:06,293
It's okay, Daxie. We're gonna be okay.

614
01:14:43,698 --> 01:14:47,566
Kellie! Kellie!
I'm coming, Kellie! I'm coming!

615
01:14:54,041 --> 01:14:55,338
Corbin!

616
01:14:55,977 --> 01:14:58,104
Please, Daddy, no!

617
01:14:58,179 --> 01:15:00,204
Daddy, stop, no!
