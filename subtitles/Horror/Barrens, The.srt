go on this trip is going to fix things?

when we're gone?

taking him in for a couple days.

of 'Sic ay Mahtantu'--

- the evil spirit of the Pine Barrens."
- Richard: It's just a myth, Danny boy.

159
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:52,002
lt's make-believe.
You know, it's made up.

160
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,422
It's Iike the Loch Ness Monster
or Bigfoot.

161
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,009
- lt's just pretend.
- ( ceII phone beeps )

162
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,470
You don't have to worry about it.

163
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,599
AII right, aII right.

164
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,894
( heavy metaI music pIaying )

165
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:12,940
From now on,
we have no iPods,

166
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:15,401
no PSPs, and no phones.

167
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,403
- AII right, Sadie?
- What?

168
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,073
- You can't be serious.
- lt's just four days.

169
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,200
If I can go without
taIking to the bank,

170
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,743
then you can go without
talking to your friends.

171
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,371
- Daddy, watch out!
- ( screams )

172
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:35,045
Sadie:
What the heII was that?

173
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,923
- Dad?
- Stay in the car.

174
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,967
Stay in the car.

175
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,639
( crow cawing )

( rustIing )

178
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,087
- Oh, my God.
- Get back in the car.

179
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:20,090
- HoIy shit.
- Get back in the car.

180
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,217
Okay. Jesus.

181
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:31,602
- ( car door cIoses )
- ( low growling )

182
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,521
What just happened?

183
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,648
Dad, what the heII was that?

184
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,527
A bIoody animaI just coIIapsed
in front of the car

185
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,696
and we're not going
to taIk about it?

186
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:50,287
- It's probabIy hunters, darIing.
- Sadie: What? Is that IegaI?

187
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:53,040
- Richard: At the right time of year.
- ls it the right time of the year?

188
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,127
No.

189
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,818
Ranger:
Hey there.

190
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,987
- Can l help you?
- Taking the famiIy camping.

191
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,822
- Oh, yeah? What's the name?
- Vineyard.

192
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,534
Here we go. All right,
you're in zone three, campsite F.

193
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,661
Just sign here for me.
I'd appreciate it.

194
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,829
Yeah.

195
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,584
ExceIIent. Just up ahead,
through the trees there.

196
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,628
- ( music playing )
- ( voices overIapping )

197
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,134
This is fantastic.

198
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,596
AII right.
Watch your head.

199
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,724
( grunts )

200
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:37,769
Take that for me.
( groans )

201
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,231
AII right. This one
is a IittIe bit Iighter.

202
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,276
Mr. Vineyard. l forgot
to give you this permit.

203
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,611
Could you put that on
your dashboard, pIease?

204
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,363
- Yes, of course.
- WeII, hey there, buddy boy.

205
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,324
So you been
to the Barrens before?

206
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,410
I came here with my dad
quite a Iot when I was IittIe,

207
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,996
but it's the first time
I've brought my wife and kids.

208
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58,790
That's great. Then I'm going to
spare you the routine then, okay?

209
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,086
Just stay in your designated spot here
and you know the driII.

210
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:06,757
- We saw a dead deer.
- Really?

211
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:11,053
Hey, can you take this to Mom
for me, champ?

212
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,096
- Good boy.
- Dead deer, huh?

213
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:15,515
- Dying deer.
- Where?

214
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,810
It was down on the Leeds HaIIow Road
about eight miles back.

215
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,271
It stumbIed out in front of us
and then just--

216
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,774
it just dropped down
in front of the car.

217
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,693
Entrails ripped out,
his antIers were gone.

218
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,530
I'II bet aII the money in my waIIet
those antIers

219
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,575
- are attached to Wyatt Barren's fence.
- Who's that?

220
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:36,620
Wyatt Barrens.
He's the piney wacko.

221
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,664
He Iives not too far from here.

222
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,625
He put up this barbed-wire fence
a coupIe years ago.

223
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:44,586
Deer have been known
to get themseIves caught up in it.

224
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,588
The more determined ones,

225
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:49,508
weII, they'II do whatever they can
to free themseIves.

226
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,885
I'm going to go check
for that deer, okay?

227
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,721
- You and your famiIy have a great time.
- Thank you.

228
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,765
- Zach.
- Hi.

229
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,267
- Oh, reaIIy?
- I'm Ryan.

230
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,603
- Hey.
- These are my buddies.

231
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:05,148
- You here with your famiIy?
- Yeah.

232
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,859
Oh, by the way, you're going to want
to lock up your food at night.

233
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,320
Tie it up to a tree branch,
not in your tent.

234
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,698
Is that reaIIy necessary?

235
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,117
WeII, we had an incident
a couple weeks back.

236
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,995
- What kind of incident?
- It was a bear attack.

237
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,665
A coupIe campers stumbIed
across a bear feeding

238
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,668
and the bear got defensive.
You know how it goes.

239
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:29,631
I thought bears were not indigenous
to the Pine Barrens.

240
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,426
There's only a handful of them
and usuaIIy they do keep to themseIves,

241
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,679
but, Iisten, just stick to the traiIs
and you'll be fine.

242
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,682
- You have a great time.
- Thanks.

243
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,101
- It's so freaking Iame.
- It's pretty Iame, eh?

244
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,270
Yeah, totaIIy.

245
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,868
( Iaughing )

246
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,619
Richard:
Who's your new friend, Sade?

247
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,164
- Just some guy.
- Yeah?

248
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,207
How oId is "just some guy"?

249
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,877
- Ow. Can you heIp me?
- Oh, are you okay?

250
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,379
- It stiII hurts.
- Still?

251
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,548
( heavy metaI music pIaying )

252
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,889
SeriousIy?

253
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,235
- Say cheese, buddy.
- ( laughing )

254
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,531
( ceII phones ringing )

255
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,791
It's hot.

256
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,084
Yeah. It is hot.

257
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:52,005
The sun's setting,
so it wiII cooI down in a few minutes.

258
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,219
Take a Iook at what I'm doing,
Danny boy.

259
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:01,640
You're going to have to know
how to set up your own tent someday.

260
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,310
Hey, wiII you do me a favor?

261
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,480
In the top of my backpack is my knife.
Can you get it for me?

262
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,078
Be carefuI.

263
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,504
Whew.

264
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,894
( growIing )

265
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:57,529
Danny!

266
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,576
- Richard!
- ( groans )

267
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,661
- Here, Richard.
- ( screams )

268
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:10,292
BIood-- bIood must have gone
to my head.

269
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,628
Here. Okay.

270
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,339
- Let's get up.
- No.

271
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:35,609
Hi.

272
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:40,113
So... you coming?

273
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:43,366
- Coming where?
- To the campfire.

274
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:47,329
Where you can have s'mores
and hot dogs,

275
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,206
and there wiII be ghost stories.

276
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,668
Camping, what do you think?

277
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:55,962
I wanted to set my own fire.

278
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,882
WeII, we can do that Iater.

279
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,719
- AII right.
- Okay. I'II meet you out there.

280
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,819
Man: Oh, you missed it. 10 minutes
before your guys showed up to camp,

281
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,738
a family of deer
waIked right through the site.

282
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:23,907
Richard: When we were coming here,
a deer waIked in front of the car

283
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:25,867
and somebody
had removed its antIers.

284
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:28,745
The ranger said that they had
probabIy been torn off on a fence.

285
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,914
It wasn't a fence.

286
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:34,751
- I'm sorry?
- The deer and his antIers.

287
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,921
- It wasn't a fence that tore them off.
- Okay. What was it then?

288
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:39,923
It was the Leeds DeviI.

289
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:43,134
- Oh-ho, Jersey DeviI.
- Ooh.

290
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,179
Both:
Ghost story time.

291
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,058
Baby, you reaIize
this is just a story, aII right?

292
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,768
Well, you know,
I'm going to go take a dump,

293
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,269
so I'II see you guys in a bit.

294
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,271
Nice. LoveIy.

295
00:21:56,691 --> 00:22:00,026
AII right, so the Jersey DeviI.
Give us the story.

296
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:02,362
WeII, it Iives in the woods.
These woods.

297
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:06,366
- What is it?
- Do you beIieve in witches?

298
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:09,619
- Witches?
- Not Iike the kind with bIack cats

299
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:12,247
and fIying broomsticks.
A different kind.

300
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:15,125
A reaI witch.

301
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,547
Mother Leeds was the town whore.

302
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:24,009
She was never married.
She was aIways pregnant.

303
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,803
The story goes
that she had 12 kids

304
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,680
and she raised them
in these woods in a IittIe, tiny cabin

305
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,849
not too far from here.

306
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,060
As you can imagine,
with 12 kids, they just ran wiId.

307
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:36,438
There was no man in her Iife
to help raise them.

308
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,815
So it kind of feII to the town
to take care of them, you know?

309
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:41,651
Feed them, protect them,
cIothe them, educate them.

310
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:45,321
Eventually, the elders
grew tired of aII of this.

311
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:49,659
They decided that the town shouIdn't be
responsible for her offspring.

312
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:53,788
So they told her--
if she bore another chiId,

313
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:56,416
then she wiII be banished
from the Barrens forever.

314
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:59,169
Oh, no. Not banished.

315
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,672
Mother Leeds was furious

316
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,507
and she was scared.
I mean, banishment from the woods

317
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:06,384
meant certain death
for her and her famiIy.

318
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,847
She was poor. She reIied on the town
to take care of her kids

319
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:13,058
and give them the things
that she was unabIe to give them.

320
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,978
So she agreed
and Iife continued on.

321
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:18,855
The Iegend goes that one day,

322
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,900
Mother Leeds grew vioIentIy iII.

323
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:24,486
She stopped going to town,
she withdrew from peopIe,

324
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,613
she became a totaI recIuse.

325
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:29,699
These rumors started popping up
that she was practicing witchcraft

326
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:32,535
and making deaIs
and conjuring the deviI himseIf.

327
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:35,080
Other rumors feared her dead.

328
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,291
The Iast rumor, it proved to be true.

329
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:41,586
Mother Leeds was pregnant.

330
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:44,047
Pregnant with her 13th chiId.

331
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:45,840
( giggIes )

332
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:48,468
Woman:
She was hiding the baby.

333
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:50,220
She couIdn't teII the eIders.

334
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,263
With 12 kids,
keeping a secret, weII--

335
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,224
- Did they find out?
- Oh, yeah.

336
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,559
They went to her cabin
to find out for themseIves.

337
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:59,521
She was very much pregnant.
She pIeaded and begged.

338
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,231
She told them that she
hadn't been with a man for years,

339
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,817
but they didn't beIieve her.
They agreed to Iet her stay in the cabin

340
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,443
untiI she gave birth.

341
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:08,613
As soon as the child was born,
she and her famiIy had to move on.

342
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:12,200
She cursed the eIders,
the town, the Barrens,

343
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:14,202
even the unborn baby.

344
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,162
She toId them
that it wasn't hers.

345
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,956
- That it was the deviI's baby.
- You all right?

346
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,458
Let him take it.

347
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,837
And take him the deviI did.

348
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,005
On the night
that she went into Iabor,

349
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,468
after hours of agony,
she finaIIy gave birth.

350
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,848
But what came out of Mother Leeds
was not human.

351
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,433
It had cIoven hooves,
a serpentine tail,

352
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,562
a head of a horse,
and a kangaroo body.

353
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:42,772
( screaming )

354
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:46,401
The 13th child of Mother Leeds
was nothing short of the deviI himseIf.

355
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,362
The midwife screamed,
she dropped the child

356
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,072
and it immediateIy
sprouted these wings

357
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,158
and started flying
aII around the room.

358
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:56,661
lt killed two of its siblings
before finaIIy turning on Mother Leeds.

359
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,122
lt attacked her.
It tore right into her.

360
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:04,294
- AII right. I think that's enough.
- No, no.

361
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,796
- What happened?
- It's okay. I'm big enough to hear.

362
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:09,382
- You sure?
- Yeah, Dad. He's big enough to hear.

363
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:14,679
What happens next, it varies
depending on who's teIIing the story.

364
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:18,349
I heard that the thing cIimbed up
the chimney and escaped into the forest.

365
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:21,477
Sadie: The book said that peopIe
have actuaIIy seen it.

366
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,272
That's true. There's been countIess
sightings over the years.

367
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,733
This is aImost 400 years ago.

368
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:28,985
Yeah, and sometimes
if you're quiet enough,

369
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:30,862
you can actuaIIy hear it.

370
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,615
- ( scoffs )
- Ryan: No, I'm serious.

371
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,825
- ( giggling )
- Shh. Listen.

372
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:39,537
No, seriousIy, guys. Listen.

373
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:50,006
- ( yeIIs )
- ( screaming )

374
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,802
Yes! Yes!

375
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,305
Woman:
Oh, my gosh!

376
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,185
You got punked!

377
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:05,396
What a bunch of bitches, huh?

378
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:06,814
Bitches!

379
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,692
- That was seriousIy messed up!
- Dude, reIax. It was a joke.

380
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,444
Dad, caIm down.
He was just joking.

381
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:13,196
( snaps )
Do I Iook amused, Sadie?

382
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:14,864
- Do l?
- Cynthia: Richard.

383
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:17,283
Look at your brother.
Look at him. Look at him.

384
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:20,662
- He's six years oId.
- Man: ChiII, bro.

385
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,163
- What the heII were you thinking?
- Richard, let's--

386
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:24,040
- Don't you touch me, man.
- Richard, stop.

387
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:25,875
- Get your hands off me.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

388
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:28,378
Man:
ChiII, chiII.

389
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,181
Sorry.

390
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,810
I didn't mean-- okay.

391
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:47,230
What's up with your pops?

392
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:53,152
- You totaIIy overreacted.
- I'm sorry.

393
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,570
I don't know what I was thinking.

394
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,740
Danny, are you aII right?
You aII right, honey?

395
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:00,326
Fine. I'm going to
take him to bed.

396
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:02,495
Take it easy, champ.

397
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:21,222
( pants )

398
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,993
( faint voices muttering )

399
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,000
( wings fIuttering )

400
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:57,258
( Iow growIing )

401
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:09,103
( Ioud growIing )

402
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,572
( beast shrieking )

403
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:28,831
- What happened?
- Richard, are you okay?

404
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:30,792
No, no, no. I don't mean--

405
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,960
( ceII phone buzzing )

406
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,882
- Were you on the phone?
- No.

407
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:41,219
Let me see it.

408
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:45,139
- Let me see your phone.
- No.

409
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:49,268
- Stop it.
- Give it here.

410
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,354
- Give it.
- Richard, stop it.

411
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:55,983
Brian?

412
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,985
Are you fucking kidding me?
Seriously?

413
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,154
( grunts, groans )

414
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,740
You need to caIm down.

415
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,910
I have never cheated on you.

416
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,871
The paranoia has to stop now.

417
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,082
You toId me
you'd stopped taIking to him.

418
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,042
I did stop taIking to him

419
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,253
and then he caIIed me
out of the bIue.

420
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:18,256
What eIse are you
Iying about, Cynth?

421
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:21,884
Huh? Am I going to have to
run around questioning you?

422
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:24,512
You are so jeaIous, Richard.
He said that he needed to taIk.

423
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,848
- Oh, just talk?
- That's aII we did. We taIked.

424
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,767
- How naive are you?
- Ever since we got married,

425
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:33,229
l have cut ties
with every singIe guy friend.

426
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:36,649
( screeching, rumbIing )

427
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:39,569
Richard?

428
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:43,990
I chose you.

429
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:54,250
I Iove you, Richard.

430
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,802
( moans )
Ow.

431
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,013
I'm sorry.

432
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:10,266
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

433
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:15,521
- I'II go and get your phone.
- No. l don't want my--

434
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,648
I don't care.
I just want to go to bed.

435
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,695
I'm going to--

436
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,823
I need to cIear my head.

437
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:32,288
( birds hooting )

438
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:52,642
( rustIing )

439
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,205
( gasps )

440
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,260
( faint voices muttering )

441
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:51,284
( birds chirping,
woodpecker pecking )

442
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,906
( winces )

443
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,826
Ryan: So your mom seems pretty cooI,
but your dad doesn't.

444
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:36,579
Cynthia is not my mother.

445
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:38,247
Oh, yeah?
What's your story?

446
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:41,250
Not a very interesting one.

447
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:45,379
My mom died when I was seven.

448
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:48,341
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

449
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:54,388
So what do you think
happened to Zach?

450
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:56,599
- ( crows squawking )
- He went out in the woods Iast night

451
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:59,101
to take a piss
and he never came back.

452
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,480
That's crazy.

453
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:20,289
Hey.

454
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,128
We were starting to wonder
when you were gonna wake up.

455
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:29,965
- What time is it?
- lt's after 11 :00.

456
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,635
- What?
- Yes.

457
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:34,804
Come here.

458
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,433
- How are you feeIing?
- I'm better, thanks.

459
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,102
You are?

460
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,562
Because you reaIIy Iook Iike shit.

461
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,357
- Right back at ya.
- Thanks, babe.

462
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,359
You're so nice.

463
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,824
So...

464
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:00,329
- did you find it?
- What?

465
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:04,500
- My phone.
- No, I didn't.

466
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:07,253
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

467
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:13,300
- Where's Sadie?
- She went on a hike with that guy.

468
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:16,554
- With that douchebag?
- God, Richard.

469
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:19,432
- lt's a hike.
- What's this?

470
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,477
He's been here since this morning
and he's been questioning everybody.

471
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:29,442
This is not camping.

472
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:32,236
We need to go further
into the forest.

473
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,655
I don't know whether
that's such a good idea, babe.

474
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,868
When she gets back,
we'II Ieave immediateIy.

475
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,847
Hey, Dad.

476
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,099
l'm going to need you
to pack your things up.

477
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:05,144
- Are we Ieaving?
- Just moving sites.

478
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,314
We're here for a reason.

479
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,237
Taking off so soon?

480
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:16,906
Moving sites.

481
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,074
Oh, where to?

482
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,785
Just gonna go
a coupIe of miIes up the traiI

483
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,787
to the Oswego Pointe.

484
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,790
Officer:
Can't say I bIame you.

485
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,750
Not how I remember it.

486
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:30,252
WeII, things have a way
of changing.

487
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:39,011
Scattering my dad's ashes.

488
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:42,097
Sorry for your Ioss.

489
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,767
You got a minute?

490
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:46,602
Seen you just woke up.

491
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,604
Richard:
Yeah, I had a bit of a headache,

492
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:50,731
but feeIing better now.

493
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:53,150
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, we're fine, hon.

494
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:55,778
We're just-- we're just chatting.

495
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:59,240
- Ma'am.
- Hi.

496
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,408
I'm Cynthia Vineyard.
Nice to meet you.

497
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:04,703
PIeasure. So when you
were up last night,

498
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,998
- did you notice anything strange?
- No. Why?

499
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,544
It's probabIy nothing.

500
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,712
One of their friends
disappeared Iast night.

501
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,339
Went into the woods
and didn't come back.

502
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:18,133
- Cynthia: You're kidding.
- lf you ask me,

503
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,969
guy drank too much,
passed out somewhere,

504
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,971
and he's going to wake up
with one heII of a hangover.

505
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:24,181
- But I got to check, you know.
- Mm-hmm.

506
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:26,141
No, we didn't see
anything strange.

507
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,977
A camper thought he saw you

508
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,938
out walking around
in the middIe of the night.

509
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:33,566
Thought maybe you'd seen
or heard something.

510
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,192
Nope.

511
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,987
No, you weren't waIking around

512
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,281
or, no, you didn't see
or hear anything?

513
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,408
Neither.

514
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,911
Huh.
WeII, it's probabIy nothing,

515
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,997
but given what happened
last week,

516
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:50,583
- we got to be a tad more cautious.
- What happened last week?

517
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,878
WeII, a coupIe of hikers
ran smack into a bear's den.

518
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,838
Cynthia:
You're kidding.

519
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:59,633
l had no idea
that there were bears up here.

520
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:03,429
Well, a handful at most.
BIack bears. MostIy stay to themseIves.

521
00:37:03,597 --> 00:37:06,098
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, jeez.

522
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:09,852
I aImost forgot. This wouIdn't happen
to be yours, would it?

523
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:13,147
Eh, yes.

524
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:14,773
Yes.

525
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:17,359
Pretty safe to assume
that phone has made its Iast caII.

526
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:19,028
Mm-hmm.

527
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,196
- You be safe out there, Cynthia.
- Thank you.

528
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:24,325
- And...
- Richard.

529
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:32,291
Bye.

530
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,340
Where are you from, Richard?
If you don't mind me asking.

531
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,300
- Philly.
- PhiIIy?

532
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:44,720
- No, by way of EngIand.
- Oh.

533
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:49,725
WeII, hope you beat the rain.

534
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:53,771
Thank you.

535
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:58,192
Richard, why did you
just lie to him?

536
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:10,245
Richard: Oswego shouId be
just over to the west here.

537
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,583
It's where my dad and I
used to camp.

538
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:17,461
It's where he'd want to be.
Definitely.

539
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,965
( Danny whimpers )

540
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:29,890
Wait.

541
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,314
I'm sorry about your phone, Cynth.

542
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,775
I reaIIy didn't think
I'd thrown it that hard.

543
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:43,112
I don't understand what was wrong
with where we were.

544
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,155
Everything, Sade.
Everything was wrong with it.

545
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:50,953
- This is way better.
- Dad, I have to go to the bathroom.

546
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:53,789
ReaIIy?

547
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,959
- Number one or two?
- One.

548
00:38:57,127 --> 00:39:00,713
AII right.
Look, you can go around here.

549
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:04,633
- Want me to come with?
- No.

550
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,969
AII right. Come on.

551
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,352
( grunts )

552
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:26,989
Here.

553
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:28,824
- Drink some water.
- l'm fine.

554
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,501
( urinating )

555
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,551
( fIies buzzing )

556
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:57,227
We need to hike about another miIe
and get to a cIearing.

557
00:39:58,438 --> 00:40:00,814
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

558
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:05,986
Need to scatter my dad's ashes.
I owe it to him.

559
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,787
( crow cawing )

560
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,213
Come on.

561
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:30,719
Move.

562
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,181
Stop it.

563
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:45,234
- NearIy there, guys.
- Sadie: Okay.

564
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,823
Sadie:
CarefuI. Over.

565
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,578
Did you see that?

566
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:01,125
What? A deer?

567
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,293
I don't think so.

568
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:09,716
- CarefuI here.
- Okay.

569
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,264
Sadie: Got it.

570
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,433
Watch out, buddy.

571
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:45,002
- Take my hand. You okay?
- Danny: Yeah.

572
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,984
Daddy, my feet hurt.

573
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:11,445
Cynthia: Do you even know
where you're going?

574
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,492
Daddy?

575
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:28,503
We're just going to have to carry you
the whoIe way then, aren't we?

576
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,175
( grunts )

577
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,556
( groaning )

578
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:55,405
- Dad, stop.
- ( music pIaying faintIy )

579
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,495
Listen.

580
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:04,122
( coughing )

581
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:07,376
- Cynthia: Danny?
- Something's over there.

582
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,544
HeIIo?

583
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:13,048
It's someone's campsite.

584
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,468
HeIIo?

585
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:18,804
( music continues )

586
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:24,059
Hey, kiddo.

587
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:28,188
Are you okay?

588
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:32,401
( music continues )

589
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,134
( static crackIes )

590
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:08,395
( gasps, screams )

591
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:13,942
Richard!

592
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:16,737
Danny, turn around.

593
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:22,784
Richard:
Danny, take this.

594
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:24,995
Help set up the tent
with your sister, okay?

595
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:27,289
- Cynthia: Richard, we can't stay here.
- ( fIies buzzing )

596
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,209
You see those cIouds, Cynth?

597
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,295
We don't want to be in the middIe
of the woods when they open up.

598
00:44:33,463 --> 00:44:37,215
Anyway, we're two or three miIes
from the main site.

599
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,262
( grunts )

600
00:44:44,474 --> 00:44:48,101
lt's okay, kiddo.
We're going to be home very soon. Okay?

601
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:51,396
Sadie, go over there
with your brother. Okay?

602
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:03,325
Oscar?

603
00:45:03,493 --> 00:45:04,701
( whimpers )

604
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,455
Richard?

605
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,708
( snarIing )

606
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,682
Richard?

607
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:44,366
Richard, what are you doing?

608
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:48,620
I'm going to cut him Ioose.

609
00:46:18,568 --> 00:46:20,735
( retching )

610
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:27,284
- Danny: I want to go home.
- l know.

611
00:46:27,452 --> 00:46:30,036
Sadie: TeII me about it.
Cynthia, we're not actuaIIy

612
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,997
staying here, are we?

613
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:35,375
Cynthia: Do you think
this is my idea of fun?

614
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:38,295
This trip is important
to your dad.

615
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:41,047
Seriously, l mean,
what the fuck is this shit?

616
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,925
- Cynthia: Come on, Sadie.
- No. This is fucked.

617
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:47,012
Dead deer, dead dogs,

618
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,931
and all this "Blair Witch"
crazy shit hanging from trees.

619
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:52,559
Your dad is going to scatter
Gramp's ashes

620
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:54,436
in the river
where they used to fish.

621
00:46:54,604 --> 00:46:57,272
Why don't we just throw Gramps in
this water and get the heII out of here?

622
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,065
It's not Iike
he'II know the difference.

623
00:47:02,612 --> 00:47:04,321
Oh, my God.

624
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,324
Cynthia?

625
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,581
( fIies buzzing )

626
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:22,005
Cynthia:
Danny, stay there.

627
00:47:52,245 --> 00:47:54,246
( spIashes )

628
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:58,875
HeIIo?

629
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:00,794
( rustIing )

630
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:13,390
( Ieaves rustIing )

631
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:18,770
( panting )

632
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:23,942
HeIIo?

633
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:25,777
Answer me.

634
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:30,574
Say something.

635
00:48:33,703 --> 00:48:35,704
( branches creaking )

636
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:45,422
( rattIing )

637
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,427
- Hey.
- Jesus.

638
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:53,013
Gee, sorry, man.
I didn't mean to scare you.

639
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:02,606
What are you doing out here?

640
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,941
Camping. You?

641
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:09,154
Was it you?
FoIIowing us?

642
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:11,823
FoIIowing you? No.

643
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:13,950
( branches creaking )

644
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:20,040
You okay, Mr. Vineyard?

645
00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:26,296
Mr. Vineyard?

646
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:31,134
I think you shouId go back
to the main campsite.

647
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:33,303
I'm kind of meeting Sadie.

648
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:37,182
- You're what?
- She just texted me.

649
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:39,142
We're going for a waIk.

650
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,144
Look, if you're mad about this whoIe
stupid story thing--

651
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:43,730
Do you believe
in the Jersey DeviI?

652
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:46,650
What? You mean,
Iike the reaI thing?

653
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:50,028
The version l heard
is a IittIe bit different from yours.

654
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:55,700
The 13th chiId of Mother Leeds
was born normal.

655
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,829
Not deformed,

656
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,499
but she did do a deaI
with the deviI.

657
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:06,544
He wouId spare her sinner's souI

658
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:09,214
in exchange for the 13th chiId.

659
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:14,719
So when the baby was born,

660
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:19,391
she waIked down to the river
by the side of her cabin...

661
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:26,022
and she offered up her son
to the devil...

662
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:32,278
...by drowning it.

663
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:37,200
( voices whispering )

664
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:42,372
Richard: One of the town eIders
saw Mother Leeds

665
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:46,084
down by the bank,
drowning her IittIe baby.

666
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:48,962
So he rushed over...

667
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:52,716
but he was too Iate.

668
00:50:53,718 --> 00:50:55,719
The baby was dead.

669
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,555
So he puIIed Mother Leeds
away from the bank.

670
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:01,725
When he turned round,

671
00:51:03,936 --> 00:51:06,062
the infant's body was gone.

672
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:10,692
Taken by the deviI himseIf.

673
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:16,072
I thought I saw the Jersey DeviI
when I was a IittIe boy.

674
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,076
- ( branches creaking )
- ( low growl )

675
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,246
( rain pattering )

676
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,708
Do you hear that?

677
00:51:26,876 --> 00:51:29,043
Hear what?

678
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:35,759
( thunder rumbIing )

679
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:46,895
I went fishing with Spider.

680
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:48,855
- Ah, that's Spider.
- Richard: Sadie, come here.

681
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:50,398
Richard:
Give me that. Give me the bag.

682
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:52,942
Sadie:
Dad! No! Give it back!

683
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,944
Dad! Give it to me!

684
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,238
What are you doing?

685
00:51:57,406 --> 00:51:58,740
- Richard?
- Sadie: Dad, give me--

686
00:51:58,908 --> 00:52:00,825
- Richard: Get off me!
- Sadie: What are you doing?

687
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:03,244
- What are you doing?
- Cynthia: Richard, stop!

688
00:52:03,412 --> 00:52:06,998
- Dad!
- I said no phones!

689
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:08,833
- Give me--
- Get off me!

690
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,545
- Dad?
- ( thunder rumbIing )

691
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,092
Sadie, are you okay?

692
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:24,808
- You sound Iike a crazy person.
- She called that boy Ryan

693
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,519
- and she toId him to come and meet us.
- So what?

694
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:30,146
That's what 17-year-oIds do.

695
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:33,441
Not Iisten to their parents,
they text boys.

696
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:35,610
What the heII, Richard?

697
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:37,862
You wanted to come here,
so we came here.

698
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,656
You wanted to Ieave
the other campsite,

699
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:41,449
so we Ieft,
and now we're here.

700
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:45,411
You know what? This is not
bringing us any cIoser together.

701
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:48,832
You have a fever.
You Iook Iike shit.

702
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:52,460
We're lost in the middle
of this fucking forest. It's raining.

703
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:57,257
For some reason the other campers tied
their dog to a tree and they vanished.

704
00:52:57,424 --> 00:53:00,093
Put yourseIf in our position.

705
00:53:00,261 --> 00:53:02,178
This is insane.

706
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:04,097
There's something wrong
with my arm.

707
00:53:04,265 --> 00:53:07,225
What? Let me see it.

708
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:13,189
( gasps )

709
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:20,154
I'm seeing things.

710
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:22,574
Things that I know aren't there.

711
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,537
Okay, fuck it.

712
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:29,747
As soon as this rain stops,

713
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:32,584
we're leaving here
and we're going to go to a hospitaI.

714
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:36,504
I Iove you and I know

715
00:53:36,672 --> 00:53:39,924
that you are trying
to fix this famiIy...

716
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,054
but this is not the way.

717
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:48,892
Okay?

718
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:05,658
Here.

719
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:08,161
CaII your boy back.

720
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:12,665
Thanks.

721
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:15,919
Thank you.

722
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:22,258
Dad's acting fucking crazy.

723
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,678
Is he mad?

724
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:29,015
No. Not at you.

725
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:34,062
We're going to get the heII out of here
as soon as it stops raining.

726
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,607
Recording: You've reached Ryan.
Leave a message.

727
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:42,236
- He's not answering.
- ( thunder rumbIing )

728
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:48,493
He wiII. Trust me.

729
00:54:59,964 --> 00:55:02,131
( thunder rumbIing )

730
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:26,197
Hi.

731
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,911
You stiII have a fever.

732
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:37,500
I think that we shouId
get out of here tonight.

733
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,213
l'm sorry
if I'm scaring everyone.

734
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:46,718
I don't feeI safe or comfortabIe
hiking out of here tonight.

735
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:52,098
The ground is mush,
it's going to be pitch bIack soon.

736
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:54,684
You can caII the sheriff.

737
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:00,523
What is that?

738
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:03,151
I found it
in the other occupants' tent.

739
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:06,738
You went through their stuff?

740
00:56:08,157 --> 00:56:11,200
I buried their dog.
I'm sure they won't mind.

741
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:21,169
- What Ianguage is this?
- I kiIIed Oscar.

742
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:24,047
What?

743
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:29,552
About a month ago,
he started...

744
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:33,639
acting different.

745
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,976
- And strange.
- ( barks )

746
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:41,314
WeII, he was oId.

747
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:45,401
I mean, what eIse couId I do?

748
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:47,945
I mean, what if he attacked
Sadie or Danny?

749
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,530
( snarIing, snapping )

750
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:53,409
I had to put him down.

751
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:57,288
He bit me.
I Ioved that fucking dog.

752
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,674
I think I'm going to go
and rest for a bit.

753
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:12,011
( grunts )

754
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:15,181
( thunder rumbIing )

755
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:20,228
( bird hooting,
crickets chirping )

756
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:38,454
- Hey.
- Hey.

757
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:41,207
What are you guys doing?

758
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:45,253
We're rather unsuccessfuIIy
trying to make s'mores, right?

759
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:48,965
- WeII, at Ieast it stopped raining.
- Yeah.

760
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:51,884
Does that mean
we finaIIy get to go home?

761
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:54,637
Cynthia:
When your daddy feeIs better,

762
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:56,222
we'II go home, okay?

763
00:57:58,142 --> 00:58:00,476
Okay, weII, I'm not getting
any service here,

764
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:03,855
so I'm going to waIk around
and try to caII Ryan.

765
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:06,190
Okay. If you're not back by the time
your father gets up,

766
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:09,193
there's going to be
a new ghost story

767
00:58:09,361 --> 00:58:12,572
- to teII around the campfire, Sadie.
- Yup.

768
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,740
- I won't go far.
- Thank you.

769
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,159
Promise.

770
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:28,838
( phone ringing )

771
00:58:35,888 --> 00:58:37,722
( distant ringing )

772
00:58:38,724 --> 00:58:40,016
Recording: You've reached Ryan.
Leave a message.

773
00:58:40,184 --> 00:58:42,185
Ryan?

774
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:51,235
- ( phone ringing )
- Ryan?

775
00:58:51,403 --> 00:58:54,071
- Ryan?
- ( distant phone ringing )

776
00:59:00,329 --> 00:59:02,330
( branches crunching )

777
00:59:12,925 --> 00:59:14,926
( ringing continues )

778
00:59:16,345 --> 00:59:18,346
( ringing )

779
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:26,771
( duII thump )

780
00:59:26,939 --> 00:59:28,481
( screaming )

781
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:37,698

01:11:58,648 --> 01:12:00,774
Yeah. Richard and Cynthia Vineyard.
They registered two days ago

943
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:03,026
and they've been missing
since yesterday morning.

944
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:20,752
I don't have a good feeIing
about this.

945
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:23,338
I've aIready got two men
in the woods looking.

946
01:12:23,506 --> 01:12:24,840
This is the Vineyards' SUV.

947
01:12:25,008 --> 01:12:27,426
- Any luck reaching that cell phone?
- No. It's going straight to voicemaiI.

948
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:28,593
The husband mentioned Oswego.

949
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:31,972
There's a clearing about two miles past
these campgrounds near the Oswego River.

950
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:34,558
- Let's go!
- I'II be two minutes behind you.

951
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:50,532
( Cynthia moaning )

952
01:12:58,541 --> 01:13:00,959

954
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:07,007
We can just...

955
01:13:07,175 --> 01:13:10,594
waIk in a straight Iine.
I mean we're bound to find somebody.

956
01:13:11,763 --> 01:13:13,597
Cynthia: Okay.

957
01:13:13,765 --> 01:13:17,225
You don't Iet anything happen to Danny.
You don't Iet go of his hand.

958
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:20,270
You don't stop moving
untiI you find someone.

959
01:13:20,438 --> 01:13:23,440
If you're not at that campsite

960
01:13:23,608 --> 01:13:26,151
before sunset,
you come right back here, okay?

961
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:28,153
Okay.

962
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:31,156
It's three or four miIes away.
Danny, come here.

963
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:40,874
Promise me that you're
going to protect your sister.

964
01:13:41,042 --> 01:13:42,751
- Okay?
- ( whimpers )

965
01:13:50,468 --> 01:13:52,135

You just need to untie me.

01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:16,243
No. I can't.

972
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:18,620
You run.

973
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,457
Danny boy.

974
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:24,835
Danny boy. Danny.

975
01:14:25,002 --> 01:14:27,462

01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:41,643
It's not safe out there!

981
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:46,857
Richard:

982

985
01:14:58,411 --> 01:15:00,537
HeIIo?

986
01:15:00,705 --> 01:15:03,832
Can anyone hear me?

987
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,169
Sadie, come back!
It's not safe out there!

988

I didn't mean--
I didn't mean to hurt you.

991
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:37,324
Danny said that something
pushed him into the water.

992
01:15:37,491 --> 01:15:41,828
- What pushed him?
- I don't remember.

993
01:15:41,996 --> 01:15:44,372
Who pushed him?

998
01:16:00,014 --> 01:16:04,392
- The boy in the fucking woods.
- You need to untie me.

999
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,187
He's foIIowing us.
He's foIIowing us.

1000
01:16:07,355 --> 01:16:10,398
He's here. I've seen it.

1001

You're hearing things--
hydrophobia.

1004
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:28,583
You have extreme paranoia
and dementia.

1005
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:34,547
There's no monster
out there, Richard.

1006
01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:39,344
The monster is you.

Danny, did he push you

Danny, I need you

He said something

He was trying to find
a hiding place.

1025
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:35,460
Dad did something bad,
didn't he?
