1
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:48,017
Someone help us!

2
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,787
Giddap!

3
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:07,747
It's the fourth floor.

4
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:09,247
- Upstairs.
- Yes, sir.

5
00:02:09,314 --> 00:02:10,397
Come on.

6
00:02:14,252 --> 00:02:15,512
No!

7
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:18,798
Not my daughter!
Mercy!

8
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:24,881
Give us room.

9
00:02:33,029 --> 00:02:35,432
Stay there.
Come on.

10
00:02:38,243 --> 00:02:40,145
Not her!

11
00:02:58,221 --> 00:03:00,890
- Break it down.
- Yes, sir.

12
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,600
Baltimore Police!

13
00:03:08,815 --> 00:03:10,700
Give me some light.

14
00:03:31,963 --> 00:03:34,048
Oh, no.

15
00:03:51,716 --> 00:03:54,410
- It's empty.
- That's impossible.

16
00:03:54,577 --> 00:03:56,671
We heard the door lock.

17
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,774
Damn it, the window!

18
00:04:20,845 --> 00:04:22,272
It's nailed shut.

19
00:04:47,622 --> 00:04:49,626
Dear God.

20
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:25,010
Phylum Chordata.

21
00:05:25,927 --> 00:05:28,005
Subphylum Vertebrata.

22
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:33,024
With kittens...

23
00:05:35,545 --> 00:05:39,896
The ways of God in nature,
as in providence, are not our ways.

24
00:06:07,418 --> 00:06:09,506
Lovely to see you all again.

25
00:06:13,302 --> 00:06:15,534
Hello, Reagan.
Did you miss me?

26
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:18,046
I'm naturally delighted
to be back in Baltimore...

27
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:21,215
... but in all honesty, I'm feeling
a bit under the weather.

28
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:25,094
However, it has been said that
what brandy cannot cure has no cure.

29
00:06:25,261 --> 00:06:29,240
So what say you to a snifter
for an old, ailing friend?

30
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:31,768
I'm sorry.
What?

31
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:33,578
Nothing.

32
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:36,826
I can assume, then,
that you're out of brandy?

33
00:06:36,873 --> 00:06:41,652
- We've got many bottles back there.
- So it's a question of finances.

34
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:45,740
I don't mean to shock you, Poe,
but we haven't seen you in a while.

35
00:06:45,907 --> 00:06:49,485
Last time you were here,
well, things got rather ugly.

36
00:06:49,652 --> 00:06:53,639
Been back in town only a few days
to find quite shockingly, I might add...

37
00:06:53,706 --> 00:06:56,989
... I seem to have exhausted
any sort of credit I once had.

38
00:07:00,496 --> 00:07:03,566
Fine, fine.
It's money you want...

39
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:07,286
Try not to shit yourself.

40
00:07:07,653 --> 00:07:09,097
That's real.

41
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:11,974
Spot these sailors a round, too,
on me.

42
00:07:18,481 --> 00:07:20,191
Christ, man, now what?

43
00:07:20,358 --> 00:07:22,819
That'll just about
cover the last tab.

44
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:25,054
Are you really
gonna be this cruel?

45
00:07:25,171 --> 00:07:27,424
The "Patriot" is publishing
one of my reviews tomorrow.

46
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:29,534
I'll be flush as a sultan by dawn.

47
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,028
If the paper publishes
anything you write...

48
00:07:32,094 --> 00:07:34,613
... you come back tomorrow,
I'll buy you the shot.

49
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,958
Tomorrow?
Tomorrow I might be dead.

50
00:07:37,225 --> 00:07:38,969
Or you might be.

51
00:07:39,836 --> 00:07:41,787
- I'll risk it.
- How is this?

52
00:07:45,258 --> 00:07:47,985
I get a drink for any man here
who recognises me...

53
00:07:48,152 --> 00:07:49,670
... or one of my poems.

54
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:52,056
You better get to the door
before I split your head open.

55
00:07:52,223 --> 00:07:54,934
My head is already split open,
you overgrown mouth-breather.

56
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:57,770
So show me some respect
or I'll give you a personal tour.

57
00:07:57,937 --> 00:08:02,383
- I'm an internationally lauded poet.
- That's why you got no money.

58
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,027
- I am Poe.
- That's what I said.

59
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:07,421
Not poor, mouth-breather!
Poe!

60
00:08:07,538 --> 00:08:10,349
Poe! Edgar Allan Poe!
Does it ring a bell?

61
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:11,487
No.

62
00:08:11,784 --> 00:08:16,914
A drink to any man in this room
who can finish this line!

63
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:18,541
"Quoth the Raven..."

64
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:22,469
- Piss off!
- By I.P. Daley!

65
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:26,841
I repeat: "Quoth the Raven"!

66
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:29,535
- "Nevermore!"
- Hah! Hah!

67
00:08:29,902 --> 00:08:31,596
It is a very favourite poem.

68
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:33,657
Vive la France!

69
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:35,943
Slobs!

70
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,686
Philistines!

71
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:41,689
You wouldn't recognise an
authentic American literary voice...

72
00:08:41,856 --> 00:08:45,009
... if it hissed in one ear
and slithered out the other.

73
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,005
Yeah, but we know other things.

74
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:49,725
Like how much it hurts to pick your
teeth up the floor with broken fingers.

75
00:08:49,752 --> 00:08:53,217
Is that the limit to your imagination,
you mental oyster? Huh?

76
00:08:53,218 --> 00:08:55,895
I can conjure a multitude
of more exquisite torments.

77
00:08:55,962 --> 00:08:58,873
Your eyeballs dissolving
in a teaspoon of lye!

78
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,752
Your tongue torn from your throats
with a blacksmith's tongs!

79
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:06,815
An enema of boiling tar!
A testicle impaled...

80
00:09:06,821 --> 00:09:09,675
- ... on a kebab skewer!
- Get out, you shit!

81
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:11,928
Slowly.
Here.

82
00:09:14,055 --> 00:09:15,915
Put her down.

83
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:17,808
She's just a girl.

84
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:20,509
What kind of monster
would do this?

85
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:42,621
Katherine LaForte, 36.
Her daughter, Anna, 12.

86
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,128
She was strangled.

87
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:50,688
She's so young.

88
00:09:51,801 --> 00:09:53,778
He was a large man.

89
00:09:54,345 --> 00:09:58,536
By the extent of his grip, well over
eight inches from thumb to forefinger.

90
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:06,704
Captain, do your men agree that someone
locked the door from the inside?

91
00:10:06,711 --> 00:10:09,682
Absolutely. We heard the
door lock just as we arrived.

92
00:10:09,768 --> 00:10:12,680
And by the time you broke down
the door, the murderer was gone?

93
00:10:12,727 --> 00:10:14,186
Not a trace.

94
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:17,860
And the window was closed
when you came into the room?

95
00:10:17,927 --> 00:10:20,591
Not just closed, nailed shut.

96
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:37,229
Tell me, how does such
a large man escape so quickly...

97
00:10:37,326 --> 00:10:41,395
... from a room in which the door
has been locked from the inside...

98
00:10:42,827 --> 00:10:45,738
... and the window nailed shut?

99
00:10:45,904 --> 00:10:50,335
I'm not sure, but the mayor
wants results this time, Inspector.

100
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,857
Have your men
question the neighbours.

101
00:10:54,913 --> 00:10:57,791
I want a list of all the men
who visited these premises.

102
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:58,918
Yes, sir.

103
00:11:15,893 --> 00:11:18,929
A lock, triggered by a spring.

104
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:20,331
But the nail had...

105
00:11:21,774 --> 00:11:23,150
Cut, mid-shaft.

106
00:11:23,317 --> 00:11:26,386
I checked that window ten times
and I never found that spring.

107
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:28,881
I wouldn't have found it either,
except...

108
00:11:29,448 --> 00:11:30,675
What is it?

109
00:11:37,956 --> 00:11:40,102
This crime is familiar to me.

110
00:11:42,126 --> 00:11:43,044
Giddap!

111
00:11:49,593 --> 00:11:50,561
Whoa!

112
00:11:51,328 --> 00:11:52,756
Not again, Mr Poe.

113
00:11:53,972 --> 00:11:54,974
Christ.

114
00:11:55,641 --> 00:11:57,142
Good morning, Percy.

115
00:11:57,309 --> 00:12:00,354
Contrary to precedent, Captain
Hamilton, I have no intention...

116
00:12:00,621 --> 00:12:02,314
... of asking for money.

117
00:12:02,481 --> 00:12:04,191
What do you want, Poe?

118
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:06,935
I've come back to town
for your daughter, Charles.

119
00:12:08,946 --> 00:12:12,087
- Over my dead body.
- Is that an option?

120
00:12:12,104 --> 00:12:13,659
Poe, please.

121
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:17,037
You know I find you as revolting
as some of your stupid stories.

122
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:18,789
Some, but not all.

123
00:12:18,956 --> 00:12:20,416
You look lovely today,
by the way.

124
00:12:20,582 --> 00:12:24,156
Get out, Poe, before
I shoot you where you sit.

125
00:12:24,193 --> 00:12:28,261
And risk splattering blood and brains
over your daughter's fine silk dress?

126
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:32,903
- Out.
- I suppose an invitation...

127
00:12:32,904 --> 00:12:35,573
... to the upcoming costume ball
is completely out of the question?

128
00:12:37,725 --> 00:12:40,436
- Father, don't.
- Sorry, Charles.

129
00:12:40,602 --> 00:12:42,756
- See you at the track.
- See you, Edgar.

130
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,905
Another abject humiliation.

131
00:12:57,077 --> 00:13:00,456
Please!
Mercy!

132
00:13:00,622 --> 00:13:03,167
I have children!

133
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:07,396
Why are you doing this?
Why?

134
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:12,860
I'm only a critic!

135
00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:25,770
Aaaaarghhh!

136
00:13:38,035 --> 00:13:39,995
Good morning, Baltimore Patriots.

137
00:13:40,162 --> 00:13:41,985
Mr Poe!
Your clothes.

138
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:44,124
Just beating the mudslingers to it.

139
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,168
Fortitude, Ivan, fortitude.

140
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:49,802
I'm afraid you might need
more than this, Mr Poe.

141
00:13:49,928 --> 00:13:52,988
- Why?
- It's a crime, Mr Poe.

142
00:13:53,588 --> 00:13:56,545
- A terrible crime.
- Out with it, man. What is it?

143
00:13:57,012 --> 00:14:00,307
Did that marsupial of an editor
dare to change my review again?

144
00:14:00,474 --> 00:14:02,868
I told him not to touch it.
I told him, Mr Poe.

145
00:14:02,935 --> 00:14:05,054
Where is my review?
Where is it?

146
00:14:06,021 --> 00:14:07,389
What has he done?

147
00:14:07,856 --> 00:14:10,025
He said there was
no more room in the layout.

148
00:14:10,192 --> 00:14:12,377
No more room?
No more room?

149
00:14:12,444 --> 00:14:16,157
Pray tell, what fine twat
did he deem more worthy?

150
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:18,784
Longfellow!

151
00:14:18,951 --> 00:14:19,856
Longfellow?

152
00:14:21,203 --> 00:14:23,372
Longfellow!

153
00:14:23,939 --> 00:14:24,915
Where is it?

154
00:14:25,082 --> 00:14:26,792
- Where is what?
- The trash bin.

155
00:14:26,859 --> 00:14:30,073
That is exactly where
all of this brain-sucking...

156
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:33,273
... soul-warping fish wrap
should be put!

157
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,416
That's lovely, Eddy.

158
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:38,590
That's a real show of adjectival
fireworks from the great Poe himself.

159
00:14:38,597 --> 00:14:42,155
Not only do you refuse to
print my review of Longfellow...

160
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:44,264
... but you run his
third-rate poem instead!

161
00:14:44,281 --> 00:14:45,387
People like Longfellow.

162
00:14:45,388 --> 00:14:47,187
That's because editors
like you tell them to.

163
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:48,640
Have you no soul, Henry?

164
00:14:48,657 --> 00:14:50,705
Doesn't the artistic enrichment
of your readers...

165
00:14:50,706 --> 00:14:54,027
- ... mean a goddamn thing to you?
- Artistic enrichment?

166
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:57,656
You've got some gall, barging
into my office and lecturing me...

167
00:14:57,823 --> 00:15:00,117
... when all you do
is criticise other people's work!

168
00:15:00,284 --> 00:15:01,799
Not true.
Not true at all.

169
00:15:01,805 --> 00:15:06,082
You called Emerson
a "sad, festering literary whore".

170
00:15:06,098 --> 00:15:08,333
- And I quote.
- Because he is precisely that.

171
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,795
Is honesty now a vice, or do you
prefer that jaded hack, Griswold...

172
00:15:11,862 --> 00:15:15,124
... fawning over some steaming
mound of hackneyed tripe?

173
00:15:15,131 --> 00:15:16,987
Yeah, doesn't think much
of your stuff, does he?

174
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:18,907
The man's a complete
intellectual nonentity.

175
00:15:18,924 --> 00:15:20,832
He's an absolute buffoon,
which is probably why...

176
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,472
... he finds so much
of a home here with you.

177
00:15:22,499 --> 00:15:24,016
Aw... you're out of control.

178
00:15:26,935 --> 00:15:28,395
I'm broke.

179
00:15:28,562 --> 00:15:30,939
Then try writing
another "Tell-Tale Heart".

180
00:15:31,106 --> 00:15:33,483
People love blood.
They love death.

181
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,700
Don't you think that if I couldn't
churn out another "Tell-Tale Heart"...

182
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,070
... or a "Pit and the Pendulum"...

183
00:15:37,087 --> 00:15:39,489
... I wouldn't indenture
my very soul to the devil.

184
00:15:39,526 --> 00:15:42,326
Henry, you've got to publish
my review. I'm desperate.

185
00:15:42,492 --> 00:15:45,390
I need stories.
Gripping stories.

186
00:15:47,539 --> 00:15:49,353
I got nothing left.

187
00:15:52,653 --> 00:15:54,488
I've used up all my tricks.

188
00:15:54,655 --> 00:15:58,300
Try laying off the liquor and the
tinctures because it's rotting your brain.

189
00:15:58,567 --> 00:16:00,244
I only drink occasionally...

190
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:03,430
... to be social,
to alleviate my shyness.

191
00:16:04,206 --> 00:16:06,667
And the tinctures
are purely therapeutic.

192
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:10,454
A slight palliative against the chill
of an orphan's despair.

193
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:16,100
- Write me something I can sell.
- You're a real bastard, Henry.

194
00:16:19,721 --> 00:16:24,476
Why are you doing this?
Why?

195
00:16:24,643 --> 00:16:26,890
What have I done?

196
00:16:27,813 --> 00:16:29,565
Please!

197
00:16:29,731 --> 00:16:31,650
God, no!

198
00:16:53,005 --> 00:16:54,506
Aargh!

199
00:16:59,803 --> 00:17:02,180
Agh!
Argh!

200
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:07,185
Aaaargh!

201
00:17:16,737 --> 00:17:18,196
Aaarghh!

202
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,337
Consider, Carl, if you will,
the human heart.

203
00:17:33,503 --> 00:17:34,880
This small chamber...

204
00:17:35,047 --> 00:17:37,215
... a vacancy, where gases
are wed to fluids...

205
00:17:37,382 --> 00:17:40,402
... and all the secrets and mysteries
of our species are hidden.

206
00:17:49,853 --> 00:17:51,989
Write another "Tell-Tale Heart".

207
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,618
You think you're so clever,
don't you?

208
00:18:13,655 --> 00:18:14,828
Miss Hamilton.

209
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:25,489
"The angels...

210
00:18:27,391 --> 00:18:31,687
... not half so happy in heaven,
went envying her and me...

211
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:35,190
.. yes, that was the reason...

212
00:18:35,357 --> 00:18:38,652
... as all men know,
in this kingdom by the sea...

213
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:42,948
... that the winds came out
of the clouds by night...

214
00:18:43,115 --> 00:18:46,243
... chilling and killing
my Annabel Lee."

215
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,796
Continue.

216
00:18:49,413 --> 00:18:54,376
"But our love, it was stronger
by far than the love...

217
00:18:54,543 --> 00:18:57,295
... of those who were
older than we."

218
00:18:57,462 --> 00:19:00,233
"Of many far wiser than we."

219
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,096
"And neither the angels
in heaven above...

220
00:19:06,263 --> 00:19:11,518
... nor the demons
down under the sea...

221
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:15,731
... can ever dissever my soul
from the soul...

222
00:19:15,897 --> 00:19:21,144
... of the beautiful Annabel Lee."

223
00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:24,882
Do you like it?

224
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:29,141
I think that it is the most
romantic thing I've ever read.

225
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:43,133
So, I had to hear about
your stunt all afternoon.

226
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,853
I just wanted to see if I could get
that little vein on the side of his neck...

227
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,364
... to finally explode.

228
00:19:49,561 --> 00:19:52,576
I think Father
has begun to suspect.

229
00:19:53,685 --> 00:19:55,680
Yes, and I consider it my duty...

230
00:19:55,687 --> 00:19:58,583
... to wrestle you away
from that gun-toting Philistine.

231
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,859
And into the arms of you,
of all people?

232
00:20:00,926 --> 00:20:01,861
Who better?

233
00:20:01,876 --> 00:20:03,691
Then why do you always
antagonise him?

234
00:20:03,748 --> 00:20:06,298
I can't help it.
I despise people who despise me.

235
00:20:06,364 --> 00:20:08,825
Edgar, we need to talk.

236
00:20:08,992 --> 00:20:11,486
- What is Carl eating?
- A heart.

237
00:20:12,037 --> 00:20:13,930
- A human heart?
- Mm-hmm.

238
00:20:14,097 --> 00:20:15,926
How in heaven did you
come by a human heart?

239
00:20:16,097 --> 00:20:17,686
An admirer works at the morgue.

240
00:20:17,793 --> 00:20:19,619
I was searching for inspiration.

241
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:22,506
So tell me again exactly...

242
00:20:22,672 --> 00:20:27,803
... how much... money you made...

243
00:20:27,969 --> 00:20:31,481
... from your self-proclaimed
world-famous poem about that bird?

244
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:34,434
Raven, $9. But did I mention
that it's world-famous?

245
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:36,712
Edgar... Edgar.

246
00:20:36,978 --> 00:20:38,855
We can't go on like this.

247
00:20:39,122 --> 00:20:43,010
Emily, what do you want?

248
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:45,370
To begin with, I want you
to get up off your knees...

249
00:20:45,387 --> 00:20:48,186
... unless you intend to use
that position for another purpose.

250
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,368
The imagination reels
with possibilities.

251
00:20:51,535 --> 00:20:53,912
But what did you have
in mind specifically?

252
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:55,856
A proposal.

253
00:20:56,998 --> 00:20:58,217
You mean marriage?

254
00:20:59,004 --> 00:21:03,421
It's not such a horrible thought.
People still do it from time to time.

255
00:21:03,588 --> 00:21:07,384
- Really? When?
- When they're in love, I suppose.

256
00:21:07,551 --> 00:21:12,800
If I were in love with that person,
would I think about her all the time?

257
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,267
Most likely.

258
00:21:15,433 --> 00:21:19,479
And would I spend
every waking moment...

259
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:22,008
... desiring to smother
the other with affection?

260
00:21:22,065 --> 00:21:24,017
It has been described as such.

261
00:21:24,184 --> 00:21:28,746
Emily, you are my greatest
and only inspiration.

262
00:21:29,013 --> 00:21:30,957
Emily Hamilton...

263
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,784
... will you be my wife?

264
00:21:33,151 --> 00:21:34,394
Yes.

265
00:21:35,704 --> 00:21:37,229
I love you.

266
00:21:43,003 --> 00:21:44,698
You ridiculous man.

267
00:21:44,754 --> 00:21:48,925
Now, what do we do about
your dear, dear, gun-toting father?

268
00:21:49,092 --> 00:21:51,136
I've been thinking about that.

269
00:21:52,929 --> 00:21:58,058
We'll tell him at my birthday ball,
in front of all of Baltimore.

270
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,563
If I were a better man,
I'd forbid it.

271
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,858
- But you're not.
- I know.

272
00:22:08,111 --> 00:22:11,198
I found some possibilities
for you, Inspector.

273
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:13,500
All are gruesome, if you ask me.

274
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:20,916
"A careful search soon brought
to light the hidden spring."

275
00:22:21,082 --> 00:22:23,585
"I pressed it, and,
satisfied with the discovery...

276
00:22:23,652 --> 00:22:25,629
... forbore to upraise the sash."

277
00:22:27,088 --> 00:22:28,274
That's it.

278
00:22:30,508 --> 00:22:32,244
Edgar Allan Poe.

279
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:37,015
And the Raven, never flitting,
still is sitting, still is sitting...

280
00:22:37,082 --> 00:22:40,936
... on that pallid bust of Pallas
just above my chamber door.

281
00:22:41,102 --> 00:22:46,107
And his eyes have all the seeming
of a demon's that is dreaming.

282
00:22:46,274 --> 00:22:51,313
And the lamp-light over him steaming,
throws his shadow on the door.

283
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,660
My soul from out that shadow
that lies floating on the floor...

284
00:22:56,826 --> 00:22:59,547
... shall be lifted...

285
00:23:00,413 --> 00:23:02,666
... nevermore.

286
00:23:07,545 --> 00:23:08,722
Who is next?

287
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:16,705
It's called
"The Butterfly and the Bee".

288
00:23:16,722 --> 00:23:18,765
An exquisite title, Mrs Bradley.

289
00:23:20,475 --> 00:23:26,431
"The butterfly to her brother bee
did sing a song of spring."

290
00:23:26,598 --> 00:23:32,145
"'Come, listen to my ode of thee,
thou honey-making thing..."

291
00:23:32,312 --> 00:23:33,797
Stop, please.

292
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:38,368
It's terrible.
I suspected it was.

293
00:23:38,535 --> 00:23:40,570
"Thou honey-making thing"?

294
00:23:40,737 --> 00:23:44,582
- I uh... attempted to rhyme the lyric.
- You've succeeded.

295
00:23:44,749 --> 00:23:48,044
The juxtaposition
of the beauty of nature...

296
00:23:48,211 --> 00:23:51,840
... with the whores of our
recently mechanised society...

297
00:23:52,007 --> 00:23:57,220
... reducing brother bee to nothing
more than a "honey-making thing"...

298
00:23:57,387 --> 00:24:00,432
... a meaningless cog
bound for destruction...

299
00:24:00,598 --> 00:24:02,684
... within the machine of nature.

300
00:24:02,851 --> 00:24:06,271
It's brilliant, Mrs Bradley!
It's terrifying, but it's brilliant.

301
00:24:06,438 --> 00:24:08,032
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

302
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:12,135
- There is someone here to see you.
- Excellent. Who is it?

303
00:24:14,237 --> 00:24:15,780
Mr Poe?

304
00:24:16,948 --> 00:24:20,427
Get me a beer,
you barbarian with a badge.

305
00:24:23,997 --> 00:24:25,540
What's going on?

306
00:24:27,042 --> 00:24:29,787
Why would hair
be attracted to a magnet?

307
00:24:29,942 --> 00:24:30,937
What?

308
00:24:31,004 --> 00:24:34,475
Soot is merely carbon residue
from coal and wood.

309
00:24:35,132 --> 00:24:36,618
Am I under arrest?

310
00:24:37,085 --> 00:24:39,779
I'm Detective Fields.
Please, sit down, Mr Poe.

311
00:24:39,846 --> 00:24:43,366
Yes, the infamous Detective Fields.
Am I under arrest?

312
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:46,353
No.
Not as yet.

313
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:49,222
Then I'd rather stand.
It makes it easier to leave.

314
00:24:49,439 --> 00:24:51,191
I am uh...

315
00:24:51,358 --> 00:24:53,368
... I'm a reader of your work.

316
00:24:53,505 --> 00:24:56,611
Well, I admit that many of my admirers
have gone to great lengths to meet me.

317
00:24:56,638 --> 00:24:58,740
Oh, I didn't say I was an admirer.

318
00:24:58,907 --> 00:25:00,503
And yet you read them.

319
00:25:04,245 --> 00:25:07,207
The night before the last, a young girl
and her mother were found murdered...

320
00:25:07,374 --> 00:25:09,162
... the daughter's body
was lodged in a chimney...

321
00:25:09,209 --> 00:25:12,087
... the mother's head was nearly
severed with a straight razor.

322
00:25:12,203 --> 00:25:14,093
The killer eluded capture
through a window...

323
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:17,284
... in which a lock was feigned
with a nail sawn in half.

324
00:25:18,426 --> 00:25:22,189
Does any of this sound
familiar to you, Mr Poe?

325
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,709
But you're talking about my story.

326
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:27,894
A work of fiction.

327
00:25:30,063 --> 00:25:31,981
I'm afraid I'm not.

328
00:25:38,405 --> 00:25:42,377
According to various witnesses,
you were seen drunk two nights ago...

329
00:25:42,383 --> 00:25:44,277
... in a tavern near the harbour.

330
00:25:45,412 --> 00:25:47,589
What time did you leave?

331
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:52,335
I don't remember.

332
00:25:52,502 --> 00:25:56,953
My leaving was... involuntary.

333
00:25:58,591 --> 00:26:01,619
Do you actually think
that I murdered these people?

334
00:26:03,138 --> 00:26:04,848
May I see your hand?

335
00:26:05,849 --> 00:26:07,092
Which one?

336
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:09,352
Either will do.

337
00:26:13,773 --> 00:26:15,692
Perhaps with the aid
of accomplices...

338
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:19,003
... such a scenario
might be conceivable...

339
00:26:20,113 --> 00:26:22,307
... however improbable.

340
00:26:25,118 --> 00:26:28,570
Yet what cannot be disputed
is the fact that...

341
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:32,000
... your imagination is the
inspiration of a horrendous crime.

342
00:26:32,167 --> 00:26:34,003
Am I to be charged, then?

343
00:26:35,086 --> 00:26:37,380
Is imagination now a felony?

344
00:26:38,147 --> 00:26:39,099
Come.

345
00:26:39,466 --> 00:26:42,010
Inspector, can I have a word?

346
00:26:56,774 --> 00:26:59,644
This is Henry Maddux,
editor of the "Baltimore Patriot".

347
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:02,155
He was brought in
to identify the body.

348
00:27:02,322 --> 00:27:07,343
His name is... I mean,
was Gris... Griswold.

349
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,984
- Ludwig Griswold.
- He worked for you?

350
00:27:10,121 --> 00:27:12,532
- Freelance writer.
- What kind of things did he write?

351
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:16,002
Some poetry. Mostly criticism.
You know, the easy stuff.

352
00:27:16,169 --> 00:27:19,622
Did he by chance have any kind of
a relationship with Edgar Allan Poe?

353
00:27:19,659 --> 00:27:23,296
Of course. They hated each other.
Had a vicious feud about a year ago.

354
00:27:23,343 --> 00:27:24,994
Sold a lot of papers.

355
00:27:25,261 --> 00:27:29,490
- How long have you known Mr Poe?
- Edgar? Well past ten years.

356
00:27:29,657 --> 00:27:32,577
You published another one of his stories,
"The Murders in the Rue Morgue".

357
00:27:32,644 --> 00:27:35,256
He wrote that one several years
back when he was in Philadelphia.

358
00:27:35,257 --> 00:27:37,440
I reprinted it
a couple of times here.

359
00:27:37,607 --> 00:27:39,717
People love the gory ones.

360
00:27:40,652 --> 00:27:41,962
So they do.

361
00:27:42,629 --> 00:27:45,198
Edgar isn't a suspect,
is he, Inspector?

362
00:27:45,365 --> 00:27:48,201
At this point, everyone
is a suspect, Mr Maddux.

363
00:27:48,488 --> 00:27:50,245
Forgive me.

364
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:56,543
I know there is a darkness
to Edgar, but...

365
00:27:56,709 --> 00:27:58,294
... they're all up in here.

366
00:27:58,461 --> 00:28:01,381
Every woman he's ever loved
has died in his arms.

367
00:28:01,548 --> 00:28:07,262
I believe that God gave him a spark
of genius and quenched it in misery.

368
00:28:07,428 --> 00:28:10,974
But as far as something like this...

369
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,704
... the only thing he's ever killed
is a bottle of brandy.

370
00:28:16,771 --> 00:28:18,628
Thank you for your time, sir.

371
00:28:23,861 --> 00:28:26,322
I know this may come
as a shock to you, Mr Poe...

372
00:28:26,489 --> 00:28:30,680
... but we are in dire need
of your unwholesome expertise.

373
00:28:44,841 --> 00:28:48,720
I really hadn't imagined the
counterweight to be... so large.

374
00:28:49,762 --> 00:28:52,280
We have reason to believe
you knew the victim.

375
00:28:52,307 --> 00:28:54,522
- Really?
- If you would?

376
00:29:00,023 --> 00:29:02,141
I don't believe I know him.

377
00:29:02,188 --> 00:29:04,597
Then perhaps
this will jar your memory.

378
00:29:07,155 --> 00:29:09,108
"Never has the
perfunctoriness of plot...

379
00:29:09,115 --> 00:29:11,914
... been so mechanised and
twisted by soulless contrivance..."

380
00:29:11,951 --> 00:29:15,455
- Griswold.
- So you do know him.

381
00:29:15,582 --> 00:29:16,598
Yes.

382
00:29:17,265 --> 00:29:20,668
We traded barbs, as in words,
not actual weapons of any sort...

383
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:23,426
... as writers are wont to do
to sell a few newspapers to gain...

384
00:29:23,463 --> 00:29:26,174
"The Pit and the Pendulum,"
when was it published?

385
00:29:26,341 --> 00:29:29,260
'42.
"Tales of Ratiocination."

386
00:29:29,427 --> 00:29:32,255
Are there other stories
in the collection?

387
00:29:32,722 --> 00:29:35,516
- Many.
- Specifically about murder?

388
00:29:35,683 --> 00:29:37,143
I'm afraid so.

389
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,312
As unfortunate as this is...

390
00:29:39,479 --> 00:29:43,401
... you may be uniquely qualified
to cast light on our killer.

391
00:29:43,708 --> 00:29:45,827
There is a logic
underlying these deaths.

392
00:29:45,843 --> 00:29:48,279
Do you think this comes
from a logical mind?

393
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:50,555
Any man who can carve
a human being in half...

394
00:29:50,582 --> 00:29:52,827
... doesn't come
from a place of logic.

395
00:29:53,034 --> 00:29:57,772
- Then from where?
- Mental disease. Obsession.

396
00:29:58,039 --> 00:29:59,524
Passion.

397
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:03,153
I believe the killer is taunting us.

398
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,687
He wants us to know
he's gonna strike again.

399
00:30:09,717 --> 00:30:11,561
What do you make of this?

400
00:30:11,928 --> 00:30:16,066
- It was covering the victim's face.
- "The Masque of the Red Death."

401
00:30:20,728 --> 00:30:21,913
What is it?

402
00:30:23,981 --> 00:30:27,648
The quote from the story mentions
Prospero, a character I created...

403
00:30:27,685 --> 00:30:31,572
... to symbolise man's arrogance even
when confronted with certain death.

404
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:35,627
Prospero hosts a costume ball
where Death comes in disguise.

405
00:30:36,194 --> 00:30:39,823
Charles Hamilton is hosting such
a ball tomorrow night at the museum.

406
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,712
"And one by one
dropped the revellers...

407
00:30:44,729 --> 00:30:47,338
... in the blood-bedewed halls
of their revel."

408
00:30:47,505 --> 00:30:51,609
If "The Masque of the Red Death"
is his next intended story...

409
00:30:51,676 --> 00:30:53,976
... we must use this opportunity
to capture this man...

410
00:30:54,006 --> 00:30:55,306
... at your costume ball, sir.

411
00:30:55,313 --> 00:30:58,541
Too harsh.
I want something older.

412
00:30:58,808 --> 00:31:00,393
"And Darkness and Decay..."

413
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,779
Six cases should be enough.

414
00:31:03,646 --> 00:31:06,983
"And Darkness and Decay
and the Red Death...

415
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,585
... held illimitable
dominion over all."

416
00:31:14,907 --> 00:31:18,406
So this gentleman dresses up
like a... like a what? Like a...

417
00:31:18,953 --> 00:31:22,390
The figure was shrouded from "head
to foot in the habiliments of the grave".

418
00:31:22,427 --> 00:31:25,326
Like a corpse, or a skeleton?

419
00:31:25,543 --> 00:31:29,188
Then at the stroke of midnight,
he comes in and kills everybody?

420
00:31:31,466 --> 00:31:34,877
Poe is a damn viper.
I ordered him away from Emily...

421
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:36,929
- ... and now he's trying to...
- Sir.

422
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:39,891
The similarities are
too coincidental.

423
00:31:40,057 --> 00:31:42,310
I'm asking you again.

424
00:31:42,477 --> 00:31:46,731
Allow me to have my men scattered
about your ball, in costume...

425
00:31:46,898 --> 00:31:49,166
... so we can hopefully
catch this monster.

426
00:31:50,276 --> 00:31:52,295
I'll hire extra security myself...

427
00:31:52,361 --> 00:31:55,865
... but I will not have this turned
into some kind of policeman's ball.

428
00:31:56,032 --> 00:31:57,217
Understood?

429
00:31:57,724 --> 00:32:00,912
I've seen the effects
of this man's determination.

430
00:32:01,078 --> 00:32:03,217
If he has indeed chosen
your gathering to...

431
00:32:03,218 --> 00:32:06,806
You will not destroy an evening that
Baltimore looks forward to every year.

432
00:32:06,807 --> 00:32:09,378
Then I insist my officers
be present.

433
00:32:09,545 --> 00:32:13,926
Fine. Just make sure they scrape
the shit off their boots.

434
00:32:18,554 --> 00:32:20,251
Who was Prospero?

435
00:32:22,725 --> 00:32:24,820
He was the host of the ball...

436
00:32:25,286 --> 00:32:27,339
... and the first to die.

437
00:32:46,958 --> 00:32:50,623
She's so wonderfully full of life.

438
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:14,318
- I've been reading this...
- What the hell is he doing here?

439
00:33:14,485 --> 00:33:16,671
- He's with me and we were just leaving.
- Hello, Captain.

440
00:33:16,687 --> 00:33:19,156
Just wanted to prove how easy
it was to penetrate the breach.

441
00:33:19,323 --> 00:33:21,504
I presume the police are here
to keep me out.

442
00:33:21,701 --> 00:33:23,256
Mr Fields, I can assure you...

443
00:33:23,281 --> 00:33:25,186
... if Mr Poe is a part
of your investigation...

444
00:33:25,192 --> 00:33:28,683
Mr Poe has a unique perspective
on certain aspects of this crime.

445
00:33:28,749 --> 00:33:32,428
Why? Is the killer a raving alcoholic,
an opium addict and atheist?

446
00:33:32,445 --> 00:33:34,572
An atheist?
You misconstrue me, sir.

447
00:33:34,589 --> 00:33:37,200
If you know what's good for you, Poe,
you'd stay away from my daughter.

448
00:33:37,221 --> 00:33:41,370
Father, I've decided to change my
costume for the ball tomorrow night.

449
00:33:41,387 --> 00:33:42,213
No.

450
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,700
Mr Fields, I'm happy to indulge your
request for the additional security...

451
00:33:45,717 --> 00:33:48,029
... but I warn you, if I see
this man there tomorrow night...

452
00:33:48,054 --> 00:33:49,979
... you'll have to
protect him from me.

453
00:33:50,146 --> 00:33:51,772
Why do we need more security?

454
00:33:51,909 --> 00:33:55,418
It appears my writing has become
the inspiration to an actual killer.

455
00:33:55,594 --> 00:33:56,861
Quite gruesome, really.

456
00:33:57,128 --> 00:33:59,739
If I would have known my work would
have such a morbid effect on people...

457
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,899
... I would have devoted
more time to eroticism.

458
00:34:02,096 --> 00:34:05,386
- You're a vile little man.
- As I said, we were just leaving.

459
00:34:05,553 --> 00:34:08,197
- Yes.
- Percy, show this man to the door.

460
00:34:10,057 --> 00:34:12,588
Mrs Bradley, could you
join me in the other room?

461
00:34:12,685 --> 00:34:13,970
What is going on?

462
00:34:14,937 --> 00:34:15,992
Emily.

463
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,733
I think we should reconsider
our announcement.

464
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:21,110
- Why? Are you backing out?
- No, no, no, never.

465
00:34:21,177 --> 00:34:24,030
If your father sees me there
tomorrow, he may have me shot.

466
00:34:24,196 --> 00:34:26,541
And there well may be
a depraved killer on the guest list.

467
00:34:26,557 --> 00:34:29,335
It's a bit much for one night,
don't you think?

468
00:34:29,602 --> 00:34:31,687
I think it sounds thrilling.

469
00:34:31,954 --> 00:34:33,339
Does it?
Why?

470
00:34:33,386 --> 00:34:38,711
How else should Edgar Allan Poe
commit himself to eternal love...

471
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:41,572
... other than under
the threat of death?

472
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:03,502
The Grim Reaper. A ghost.
The Headless Horseman, if you like.

473
00:35:03,669 --> 00:35:05,588
He should be easy to spot.

474
00:35:05,754 --> 00:35:08,549
Elderidge, take some of these
men and patrol the back.

475
00:35:08,716 --> 00:35:10,623
- Sir.
- Move out.

476
00:35:19,059 --> 00:35:21,900
You must be selling a hell lot of
newspapers these days, Henry.

477
00:35:21,902 --> 00:35:23,057
Two murders in a one week.

478
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:27,420
Circulation has indeed improved,
despite unfortunate events.

479
00:35:28,344 --> 00:35:29,629
Time for a piss.

480
00:35:47,213 --> 00:35:50,090
- May I have this dance?
- Father.

481
00:35:50,257 --> 00:35:51,518
Not now.

482
00:35:53,744 --> 00:35:58,124
I'm not sure what's troubling you,
but your future happiness...

483
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,926
... means more to me
than I could possibly describe.

484
00:36:01,123 --> 00:36:04,248
I really hope you feel that way
at the end of the evening.

485
00:36:05,314 --> 00:36:08,817
Whatever this is about, I need
you to be a little more social.

486
00:36:08,984 --> 00:36:11,508
This is an important gathering
for me and for us.

487
00:36:11,595 --> 00:36:14,265
Father, I know what's expected.

488
00:37:04,106 --> 00:37:06,295
Excuse me!
Please.

489
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,029
Please, step aside.

490
00:37:10,779 --> 00:37:12,181
Step aside!

491
00:37:48,817 --> 00:37:51,507
Fields' men aren't causing
any trouble, are they?

492
00:37:51,583 --> 00:37:52,563
No, sir.

493
00:37:54,657 --> 00:37:57,117
What of Poe?
Any sign of him?

494
00:37:57,284 --> 00:37:58,869
Not so far.

495
00:38:10,005 --> 00:38:11,682
A glass of wine, sir?

496
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,312
You look just stunning, my dear.

497
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:31,819
Nevermore.

498
00:38:35,364 --> 00:38:40,352
"... can ever dissever my soul
from the soul of the..."

499
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:42,997
I'm sorry.
I'm waiting for someone.

500
00:38:43,023 --> 00:38:47,323
"Of the beautiful Annabel... Lee."

501
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,570
You dance passionately, sir.

502
00:39:31,387 --> 00:39:34,281
If I could, I would dance
with you throughout time.

503
00:39:34,758 --> 00:39:37,551
- I love you, Edgar.
- And I you.

504
00:39:38,635 --> 00:39:40,595
You really are a reckless girl...

505
00:39:41,722 --> 00:39:44,516
... to dance with a stranger
with a mask...

506
00:39:44,683 --> 00:39:46,961
... with a murderer in our midst.

507
00:39:49,438 --> 00:39:50,732
Speaking of which...

508
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:53,825
Courage, Edgar.

509
00:40:00,938 --> 00:40:02,401
- It's happening!
- This way!

510
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:06,355
Emily!

511
00:40:14,838 --> 00:40:16,015
Agh!

512
00:40:16,382 --> 00:40:18,509
He told me you'd ordered it
for the party.

513
00:40:18,675 --> 00:40:22,137
- Who? Who ordered it?
- I'm supposed to deliver this.

514
00:40:24,857 --> 00:40:26,600
My daughter.
He has her.

515
00:40:26,667 --> 00:40:29,086
- Percy, seal off this building! Now!
- Find her!

516
00:40:29,253 --> 00:40:30,164
Come on!

517
00:40:40,389 --> 00:40:43,475
"I challenge the brilliant
detective mind of Edgar Allan Poe...

518
00:40:43,642 --> 00:40:46,562
... a game of wits with
Emily's life in the balance."

519
00:40:46,729 --> 00:40:49,857
"You will immortalise for the
exquisite pleasure of your readers...

520
00:40:50,024 --> 00:40:54,111
... this, your very own
"Descent into the Maelstrom".

521
00:40:54,278 --> 00:40:58,240
"Which shall appear in serial form
in the "Baltimore Patriot"."

522
00:40:58,407 --> 00:41:00,826
"Know that I will kill again,
and on that new corpse...

523
00:41:00,993 --> 00:41:04,330
... I will leave you clues
that will lead to Emily."

524
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:07,041
"If I do not read a vivid
accounting of this convergence...

525
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:10,545
... of fact and fiction,
then dear Emily will die."

526
00:41:11,211 --> 00:41:14,298
"Your only hope is to
imagine a way to save her."

527
00:41:14,465 --> 00:41:17,176
"I dare you to try to conceive
of the painstaking care...

528
00:41:17,343 --> 00:41:19,094
... I have taken to secure her...

529
00:41:19,261 --> 00:41:23,223
... and the elegant means
leading inexorably to her end."

530
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:26,685
"Are you up to the task, Mr Poe?"

531
00:41:26,852 --> 00:41:28,729
"Are you even capable
of imagining...

532
00:41:28,756 --> 00:41:31,273
... the means to save
your beloved's life?"

533
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,152
"Or shall this tale end
as all your stories do...

534
00:41:35,319 --> 00:41:40,107
... with Madness, Sin and Horror,
the soul of the plot?"

535
00:41:41,283 --> 00:41:43,427
Your men are right.
I've killed her.

536
00:41:43,744 --> 00:41:46,255
We must assume
Miss Hamilton is still alive.

537
00:41:46,402 --> 00:41:49,526
Why must we assume that? Because
it's more convenient to do so?

538
00:41:50,793 --> 00:41:52,270
Why am I to blame?

539
00:41:53,337 --> 00:41:55,839
Where were all these officers
last night?

540
00:41:56,006 --> 00:41:57,275
Where were you?

541
00:41:58,342 --> 00:42:01,887
- He told you he was coming!
- Mr Poe, listen to me.

542
00:42:02,429 --> 00:42:04,139
This killer is methodical.

543
00:42:04,306 --> 00:42:06,892
He will keep her alive
to keep you involved.

544
00:42:07,059 --> 00:42:10,187
It's part of his game and that's
the logic that will trap him.

545
00:42:10,354 --> 00:42:13,187
It's the facts of this case
that give us the advantage.

546
00:42:13,683 --> 00:42:17,069
Did you tell your people to
familiarise themselves with my face?

547
00:42:17,606 --> 00:42:20,439
They'll be seeing it every hour
till my daughter is returned to me.

548
00:42:20,486 --> 00:42:21,782
Mr Hamilton, I'm very sorry.

549
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:24,827
As well you should be!
She was taken under your watch!

550
00:42:24,993 --> 00:42:28,002
- Sir, if you would please...
- What the hell is he doing here?

551
00:42:29,498 --> 00:42:31,500
- Bastard!
- Hey!

552
00:42:33,669 --> 00:42:36,380
Arrest him
It's his fault.

553
00:42:36,647 --> 00:42:39,792
There is plenty of fault
to be passed around.

554
00:42:40,259 --> 00:42:43,720
I'm sure you understand what
I mean by that, Mr Hamilton?

555
00:42:44,087 --> 00:42:49,113
Mr Poe here is our only connection
to the man who has your daughter.

556
00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:51,353
I suggest you remember that.

557
00:42:59,945 --> 00:43:01,327
Out of the way.

558
00:43:06,652 --> 00:43:08,403
We will reconvene in two hours.

559
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:10,398
Until then, I want every street
in Baltimore manned.

560
00:43:10,425 --> 00:43:12,833
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

561
00:43:19,701 --> 00:43:22,014
Lord help my poor soul.

562
00:43:32,703 --> 00:43:34,161
Oh.
Oh, Lord.

563
00:43:40,002 --> 00:43:42,963
Wait, wait...
No, no, no...

564
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:47,009
Wait... please...

565
00:43:48,355 --> 00:43:49,833
Help!
Let me out!

566
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:51,346
Let me out of here!

567
00:43:52,813 --> 00:43:55,651
No, stop!
Stop!

568
00:44:00,147 --> 00:44:02,482
Shut it, Emily...

569
00:44:02,649 --> 00:44:05,227
... or I'll shut it for you.

570
00:44:07,606 --> 00:44:09,196
Okay...

571
00:44:12,701 --> 00:44:16,029
Okay... I'm sorry.

572
00:44:18,924 --> 00:44:20,126
Sorry...

573
00:44:31,481 --> 00:44:34,389
The human body
is to be revered.

574
00:44:34,556 --> 00:44:37,392
We must at all times
be respectful...

575
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:43,712
... and remember that a cadaver
is more than a mere learning tool.

576
00:44:43,899 --> 00:44:45,901
We shall examine the lungs.

577
00:44:46,068 --> 00:44:49,623
This man is an alleged victim
of consumption.

578
00:44:53,742 --> 00:44:56,506
Professor?
What is it?

579
00:44:58,622 --> 00:44:59,890
Dear God.

580
00:45:21,603 --> 00:45:24,726
She could be a prostitute,
the way she's painted up.

581
00:45:27,567 --> 00:45:29,052
Did you open this?

582
00:45:30,612 --> 00:45:32,015
Were your hands clean?

583
00:45:33,281 --> 00:45:37,344
Yes. I don't believe
I left that smudge, Inspector.

584
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:40,540
She must have fought him
or scratched him.

585
00:45:41,607 --> 00:45:43,305
She didn't fight him.

586
00:45:45,176 --> 00:45:48,914
There are no wounds on her wrists.
It can't be her blood, Inspector.

587
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,149
He came at her from behind.

588
00:45:52,259 --> 00:45:53,544
Strangled.

589
00:45:56,216 --> 00:45:58,190
Another of your stories?

590
00:45:59,157 --> 00:46:03,213
Mr Poe, I asked is this
another of your stories?

591
00:46:04,604 --> 00:46:07,123
"The Mystery of Marie Roget."

592
00:46:10,761 --> 00:46:12,579
It's a sailing knot.

593
00:46:12,606 --> 00:46:15,457
It's a bowline knot, to be exact.

594
00:46:15,724 --> 00:46:17,309
Just as it was in the story.

595
00:46:17,476 --> 00:46:20,354
All right.
Then what of it?

596
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,897
Who was she?

597
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:29,004
She was a girl... who worked in
the stores in Paris, near the Quais.

598
00:46:29,571 --> 00:46:33,637
She drowned. There was no
mention of blood on her hands.

599
00:46:34,084 --> 00:46:36,436
He added that detail.

600
00:46:38,564 --> 00:46:41,658
You must write it now.
Every detail.

601
00:46:41,925 --> 00:46:45,083
The knot, her dress, her hands.

602
00:46:46,797 --> 00:46:49,608
Her eyes.
Her end.

603
00:46:55,055 --> 00:46:57,933
Her smile portended nothing.

604
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:02,759
Her innocence was the first part
of her soul to die.

605
00:47:03,096 --> 00:47:07,301
And while it happened,
he stood still...

606
00:47:07,567 --> 00:47:11,697
... watching to fully enjoy
the dreadful metamorphosis...

607
00:47:11,863 --> 00:47:14,525
... from a life full of hope...

608
00:47:14,991 --> 00:47:17,097
... to a death without purpose.

609
00:47:27,504 --> 00:47:28,964
Mr Poe.

610
00:47:30,173 --> 00:47:32,809
I've been, erm...

611
00:47:33,196 --> 00:47:36,046
I'm sorry to disturb you, but...

612
00:47:36,513 --> 00:47:38,598
I was a little concerned
about your...

613
00:47:38,765 --> 00:47:41,243
- My progress?
- Yes.

614
00:47:42,185 --> 00:47:46,590
It feels as if I've gone from author
to character in one of my tales.

615
00:47:47,307 --> 00:47:51,269
As trapped and bedevilled as any of
the hapless bastards I ever created.

616
00:47:52,154 --> 00:47:53,897
I can appreciate that.

617
00:48:02,497 --> 00:48:05,742
Regardless of what
you think of me, Fields...

618
00:48:06,209 --> 00:48:09,045
... I am a master of my art...

619
00:48:09,212 --> 00:48:11,548
... and I will not fail her.

620
00:48:12,716 --> 00:48:13,977
I know that.

621
00:48:19,473 --> 00:48:23,268
Look, I uh... I think I was overly
harsh with you the other day...

622
00:48:23,435 --> 00:48:26,702
... and for that,
I'd like to apologise.

623
00:48:36,031 --> 00:48:39,910
My wife was singing at the piano
when she first coughed up blood.

624
00:48:41,161 --> 00:48:46,075
I prepared myself for the worst,
but Virginia seemed to recover...

625
00:48:47,042 --> 00:48:49,427
... and foolishly,
I succumbed to hope.

626
00:48:52,839 --> 00:48:56,026
But by year's end,
the blood came again...

627
00:48:56,593 --> 00:48:58,169
... and again.

628
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:00,497
Great effusions of blood.

629
00:49:00,764 --> 00:49:05,553
Raging fevers, her sheets spattered
with crimson, drenched with sweat.

630
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,805
I often thought I could hear
the sound of darkness...

631
00:49:08,822 --> 00:49:12,500
... as it stole across the horizon
rushing towards me.

632
00:49:13,109 --> 00:49:14,878
But here I...

633
00:49:16,613 --> 00:49:21,293
I was overwhelmed
by a sorrow so poignant...

634
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:25,265
... when she finally died, I felt
in all candour a great release.

635
00:49:26,832 --> 00:49:28,575
But it was soon supplanted
by the return...

636
00:49:28,582 --> 00:49:33,663
... of that dark and morbid melancholy
that has followed me like a black dog...

637
00:49:35,757 --> 00:49:37,325
... all my life.

638
00:49:40,303 --> 00:49:42,168
Until I met Emily.

639
00:49:47,602 --> 00:49:50,046
Time is running out, Inspector.

640
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:52,859
Do you really believe
she's still alive?

641
00:49:56,111 --> 00:49:57,988
I'm sure of it.

642
00:50:48,163 --> 00:50:49,840
Magnificent.

643
00:50:50,206 --> 00:50:55,820
Poe, you have done it again.
The invention is... breathtaking.

644
00:50:55,837 --> 00:51:00,757
The line of truth and fiction
has never been so...

645
00:51:00,884 --> 00:51:02,636
... so...

646
00:51:02,902 --> 00:51:04,704
I'm not sure about your headline.

647
00:51:04,721 --> 00:51:07,098
Henry, you will not
change one word.

648
00:51:07,265 --> 00:51:09,491
Fine.
Ivan? Ivan...

649
00:51:11,686 --> 00:51:13,521
Reset page one immediately.

650
00:51:20,779 --> 00:51:25,617
... melancholy that's followed me
like a black dog all my life...

651
00:51:25,784 --> 00:51:27,702
I love you, Edgar.

652
00:51:34,501 --> 00:51:35,686
Fields!

653
00:51:36,903 --> 00:51:39,647
- The blood, Poe, it's fake!
- The blood?

654
00:51:39,814 --> 00:51:43,702
And the prostitute. She's not a prostitute.
It's stage blood. She's an actress.

655
00:51:43,969 --> 00:51:46,491
- The blood on the hands. "Macbeth."
- Exactly.

656
00:51:49,766 --> 00:51:53,311
Poe's like the hangman, the bastard,
making money off the dead.

657
00:51:53,478 --> 00:51:57,148
Get your paper! All about
a serial killer on the loose!

658
00:51:57,315 --> 00:52:00,235
Cantrell is at the theatre.
All the exits are secured.

659
00:52:00,402 --> 00:52:03,154
The Imperial, I'm assuming.
My mother's playhouse.

660
00:52:03,321 --> 00:52:05,198
The victim was still
in her costume...

661
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:08,376
... which suggests she was abducted
directly from the theatre.

662
00:52:14,332 --> 00:52:15,675
We'll find her.

663
00:52:17,377 --> 00:52:20,806
I would gladly give my life
for hers, Mr Fields.

664
00:52:23,008 --> 00:52:24,618
I know you would.

665
00:52:39,315 --> 00:52:41,709
Out, damned spot.
Out, I say!

666
00:52:41,876 --> 00:52:44,132
One, two...

667
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:49,409
... then 'tis time to do it!

668
00:52:51,745 --> 00:52:53,580
Hell is murky!

669
00:52:55,081 --> 00:52:56,658
What the hell is happening?
Who are you?

670
00:52:56,684 --> 00:52:57,480
I order the police department...

671
00:52:57,504 --> 00:52:59,210
... and I have a warrant
to search these premises.

672
00:52:59,277 --> 00:53:00,937
What for?
There's a show going on...

673
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:03,982
- Bring all your stagehands here now.
- They have to man the ropes.

674
00:53:04,149 --> 00:53:07,218
First Lady Macbeth takes a powder,
and now you bastards...

675
00:53:08,511 --> 00:53:09,991
Ten seconds.

676
00:53:16,186 --> 00:53:18,488
Put out your hands.

677
00:53:22,901 --> 00:53:26,462
Ladies and gentlemen,
the play will resume shortly.

678
00:53:26,529 --> 00:53:28,156
Please take your seats.

679
00:53:29,723 --> 00:53:32,258
You, step forth.
Take off the gloves.

680
00:53:32,285 --> 00:53:34,821
- Is this your entire crew?
- Yes.

681
00:53:35,038 --> 00:53:37,082
- Are you sure?
- I am.

682
00:53:37,248 --> 00:53:38,503
Count them again.

683
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:42,012
What are you doin'?

684
00:53:42,198 --> 00:53:44,714
You know we got no more than
seven minutes before the act change.

685
00:53:44,881 --> 00:53:46,926
- You, where are you from?
- Liverpool.

686
00:53:47,133 --> 00:53:50,001
Got three days' shore leave
to make some extra scratch.

687
00:53:50,098 --> 00:53:52,627
- So if you don't mind, please...
- Read it.

688
00:53:55,308 --> 00:53:57,769
It's "Macbeth".
I know the play.

689
00:53:57,936 --> 00:54:00,255
- Someone's missing.
- Who?

690
00:54:00,491 --> 00:54:01,831
- Maurice.
- Where is he?

691
00:54:01,998 --> 00:54:05,158
I don't know, but nobody's allowed
to leave until the show is over.

692
00:54:05,485 --> 00:54:06,553
He's here.

693
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,714
If any of these men try to leave,
shoot them.

694
00:54:09,781 --> 00:54:10,849
Yes, sir.

695
00:54:35,483 --> 00:54:39,244
Wash your hands
Put on your nightgown.

696
00:55:11,217 --> 00:55:14,287
You there, come out.
Show yourself.

697
00:55:24,647 --> 00:55:25,607
Stop!

698
00:55:26,916 --> 00:55:28,276
Show yourself!

699
00:55:29,277 --> 00:55:30,603
I will kill you!

700
00:55:35,709 --> 00:55:37,477
I have a pistol aimed on you.

701
00:55:37,704 --> 00:55:38,650
Come out now.

702
00:55:38,651 --> 00:55:41,080
Put your hands right where
I can see them or I will fire.

703
00:55:56,304 --> 00:55:58,556
Don't shoot me!
I'm in the play!

704
00:56:00,433 --> 00:56:03,553
Are you all right?
You stay here, okay?

705
00:56:08,816 --> 00:56:10,985
- What happened?
- My pistol, I lost it.

706
00:56:11,152 --> 00:56:12,907
- I saw him.
- Damn it.

707
00:56:12,954 --> 00:56:15,089
- Seal the doors! He's here!
- Yes, sir!

708
00:56:15,156 --> 00:56:17,482
And the missing stagehand,
what was his name?

709
00:56:17,608 --> 00:56:18,785
Maurice.

710
00:56:18,952 --> 00:56:21,000
Hey, hey, hey! Where does
the crew keep their things?

711
00:56:21,017 --> 00:56:22,497
We have lockers downstairs.

712
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,386
Here.
Poe!

713
00:56:39,013 --> 00:56:40,924
Fields, up here.

714
00:56:56,739 --> 00:56:58,033
What is that?

715
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:00,885
Looks like a piece of fish.

716
00:57:01,911 --> 00:57:03,979
That... is a human tongue.

717
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:07,627
What does it mean?

718
00:57:09,502 --> 00:57:13,416
Wait, yes.
"The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar."

719
00:57:13,423 --> 00:57:16,492
A man suspended between
life and death by mesmerism.

720
00:57:16,659 --> 00:57:20,129
A living conscious corpse who can only
speak via the vibrations of his tongue.

721
00:57:20,146 --> 00:57:23,016
It's a bit of burlesque.
But the tongue wasn't severed.

722
00:57:23,182 --> 00:57:26,444
Mr Poe!
Sir, there's been an accident.

723
00:57:27,478 --> 00:57:28,968
Put your backs into it!

724
00:57:31,441 --> 00:57:33,901
Come on! Keep it going!
We're gonna need more!

725
00:57:34,068 --> 00:57:36,546
The fire's not going
to put itself out! Come on!

726
00:57:36,863 --> 00:57:39,594
Jack, get all those people
back from the building!

727
00:57:39,841 --> 00:57:43,261
Please, step back! Move back!
It's not safe. Get back, sir, get back!

728
00:57:43,328 --> 00:57:44,738
Everybody, get back!

729
00:57:47,999 --> 00:57:49,876
A damnation on earth.

730
00:57:50,043 --> 00:57:55,099
Hell's brimstone his food,
consumed from birth, in solitude.

731
00:57:57,717 --> 00:58:00,458
Let's go, men!
Move it, move it!

732
00:58:03,901 --> 00:58:08,623
The windows were shattered first.
I don't think it was an accident.

733
00:58:10,755 --> 00:58:12,231
I'm certain you're correct.

734
00:58:12,398 --> 00:58:14,909
Sir, we also found this.

735
00:58:15,376 --> 00:58:17,520
Guess I might be happy to
take it in if it's not yours.

736
00:58:17,696 --> 00:58:19,430
He's been sticking with us
since we got here.

737
00:58:19,457 --> 00:58:22,097
I can tell from the sound
of his voice he's mine.

738
00:58:23,868 --> 00:58:25,192
Thank you, Officer.

739
00:59:47,743 --> 00:59:50,246
Why are you doing this to me?

740
00:59:54,876 --> 00:59:56,800
Please let me out.

741
00:59:57,962 --> 00:59:59,920
I can't.

742
01:00:02,383 --> 01:00:03,697
Yes, you can.

743
01:00:04,443 --> 01:00:05,759
You can.

744
01:00:06,846 --> 01:00:08,107
Please.

745
01:00:09,974 --> 01:00:11,194
I'm so cold.

746
01:00:22,987 --> 01:00:24,874
Why are you doing it?

747
01:00:30,912 --> 01:00:34,132
Please don't let me die in here.

748
01:00:38,211 --> 01:00:39,854
Miss Hamilton...

749
01:01:14,355 --> 01:01:18,998
No! No! No!
No! No! No!

750
01:02:00,175 --> 01:02:01,352
Mr Poe.

751
01:02:03,115 --> 01:02:05,156
I'm afraid I found myself
without lodgings.

752
01:02:05,172 --> 01:02:07,000
Yes, I heard.

753
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:09,697
I don't mean to impose.

754
01:02:09,844 --> 01:02:13,589
Oh, yes, of course.
Forgive me, please. Come in.

755
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:18,007
It appears to Baltimore I've become
one of the very demons I conceived.

756
01:02:18,394 --> 01:02:19,872
The fire was intentional,
did you know that?

757
01:02:19,994 --> 01:02:21,372
Yes, I heard.

758
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:23,733
The town is angry.
The mayor wants results.

759
01:02:23,899 --> 01:02:26,936
Another set of unsolved murders,
Inspector? Is that it?

760
01:02:36,078 --> 01:02:39,415
He was inches away.
If I hadn't dropped my weapon...

761
01:02:40,499 --> 01:02:42,010
Perhaps.

762
01:02:42,877 --> 01:02:45,346
But we have made some headway.

763
01:02:45,713 --> 01:02:50,701
According to theatre records, the
sailor's name is a Maurice Robichaux.

764
01:02:50,968 --> 01:02:52,952
Does that mean anything to you?

765
01:02:53,179 --> 01:02:54,164
No.

766
01:02:55,431 --> 01:02:58,004
Cantrell and I made
some inquiries at the docks.

767
01:02:58,351 --> 01:03:00,342
Apparently, he was signed on
to a trading vessel...

768
01:03:00,344 --> 01:03:01,912
... which made port five days ago.

769
01:03:02,179 --> 01:03:03,397
The start of the murders.

770
01:03:03,564 --> 01:03:06,375
And, like many sailors, he took
employment in the theatre...

771
01:03:06,422 --> 01:03:08,427
... working the backstage riggings.

772
01:03:08,694 --> 01:03:11,155
But, as we know,
he wasn't there today.

773
01:03:11,322 --> 01:03:13,908
Everything down to our entrance
was prearranged.

774
01:03:14,075 --> 01:03:17,111
Look, it may be arduous...

775
01:03:17,178 --> 01:03:21,015
... but I've learned, in order
to find a needle in a haystack...

776
01:03:21,052 --> 01:03:22,917
... you simply have to
go through the hay.

777
01:03:23,084 --> 01:03:26,087
- These ship's records, I think...
- Ship's records?

778
01:03:26,754 --> 01:03:30,132
I must remind you, Mr Poe,
every detail here is essential.

779
01:03:30,299 --> 01:03:36,105
Tell me, are you not piqued
by your abject failure...

780
01:03:36,172 --> 01:03:38,149
... to ferret out this assassin?

781
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:41,706
Your reputation is at stake.
Look at me.

782
01:03:45,022 --> 01:03:46,691
Four people are dead!

783
01:03:46,857 --> 01:03:49,652
An angel breaks on the rack
of some depraved beast...

784
01:03:49,819 --> 01:03:54,532
... but this clerk squints over his
eyeshades at ledgers and timetables!

785
01:03:54,699 --> 01:03:56,759
Is this a fucking joke?

786
01:03:56,826 --> 01:03:58,285
What else should we do?

787
01:03:58,452 --> 01:04:01,852
Run around all of Baltimore
screaming out her name?

788
01:04:28,232 --> 01:04:31,018
Now, please, think.

789
01:04:31,902 --> 01:04:33,747
Start with the sailor.

790
01:04:34,713 --> 01:04:37,236
Have you ever written
anything about a sailor?

791
01:04:37,283 --> 01:04:38,359
No.

792
01:04:45,082 --> 01:04:46,984
Did you speak
with the ship captain?

793
01:04:47,251 --> 01:04:49,170
- I did.
- And?

794
01:04:49,436 --> 01:04:52,965
Robichaux was a valued crewman.
Well liked.

795
01:04:53,132 --> 01:04:54,767
Had a family back home.

796
01:04:55,134 --> 01:04:57,695
- Where?
- In France.

797
01:04:58,262 --> 01:04:59,800
Nîmes.

798
01:05:00,514 --> 01:05:02,391
- Anything?
- No.

799
01:05:02,558 --> 01:05:05,102
Yes, possibly.
Who knows?

800
01:05:05,269 --> 01:05:12,226
You see, what I keep asking
myself is... why Baltimore?

801
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:15,993
I mean, the Fortunato had docked
in several ports around the world.

802
01:05:16,030 --> 01:05:17,995
- The what?
- It's been all over the world.

803
01:05:18,032 --> 01:05:21,210
- The name of the ship, say it again.
- Fortunato.

804
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:26,665
"The thousand injuries of Fortunato
I had borne as I best could."

805
01:05:26,832 --> 01:05:28,209
What is that?

806
01:05:28,375 --> 01:05:31,128
The first sentence of
"The Cask of Amontillado".

807
01:05:31,295 --> 01:05:34,106
- Go on.
- A story I wrote about revenge.

808
01:05:34,173 --> 01:05:36,127
A man kills his rival
by walling him up.

809
01:05:36,193 --> 01:05:38,297
The victim in Fortunato
is entombed alive.

810
01:05:38,344 --> 01:05:40,788
- Where?
- In the catacombs of a palazzo.

811
01:05:40,805 --> 01:05:41,816
The story is set in Italy.

812
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:44,116
Well, there are no
catacombs in Baltimore.

813
01:05:44,253 --> 01:05:48,053
No, but there are tunnels
underneath the city.

814
01:05:48,729 --> 01:05:50,005
Tunnels?

815
01:05:50,472 --> 01:05:51,899
The waterworks.

816
01:05:53,984 --> 01:05:57,822
You are looking for anything that
would indicate recently laid masonry.

817
01:05:57,988 --> 01:05:59,365
We will be timing this.

818
01:05:59,532 --> 01:06:01,138
I will blow my whistle as such.

819
01:06:03,325 --> 01:06:06,622
We will then shout her name in
unison from all areas of the tunnels.

820
01:06:06,789 --> 01:06:08,894
Emily!

821
01:06:10,876 --> 01:06:13,771
There will be a pause of
ten seconds of absolute silence...

822
01:06:13,798 --> 01:06:16,131
... when we will listen
for the smallest sound.

823
01:06:16,298 --> 01:06:19,134
Anything to indicate movement
from behind the walls.

824
01:06:19,401 --> 01:06:22,137
If an officer detects something,
he will blow his whistle...

825
01:06:22,204 --> 01:06:24,682
... and we will examine
the wall at that point.

826
01:06:24,849 --> 01:06:26,934
- Are we clear?
- Yes, sir.

827
01:06:27,101 --> 01:06:28,278
Then move out.

828
01:07:00,184 --> 01:07:04,680
- Emily!
- Emily!

829
01:07:06,056 --> 01:07:07,600
Emily!

830
01:07:08,966 --> 01:07:09,995
Shh!

831
01:07:35,377 --> 01:07:37,454
Emily!

832
01:07:42,426 --> 01:07:44,000
Emily!

833
01:07:48,682 --> 01:07:50,251
Emily!

834
01:07:54,730 --> 01:07:56,815
Over here.
They're down here.

835
01:07:56,982 --> 01:07:59,818
The mortar's a different colour.
Look.

836
01:08:03,530 --> 01:08:04,690
Hold that.

837
01:08:06,158 --> 01:08:08,393
Here.
Stand back.

838
01:08:16,003 --> 01:08:17,526
What is it?
Do you have her?

839
01:08:22,007 --> 01:08:24,935
- Give me that.
- What is it, Inspector?

840
01:08:28,347 --> 01:08:30,332
- Keep digging.
- Yes, sir.

841
01:09:26,155 --> 01:09:27,298
Halt!

842
01:09:40,803 --> 01:09:42,509
Aaarghhh!

843
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,002
Get the doctor.

844
01:10:07,446 --> 01:10:09,364
"Do not bemoan the sailor's life."

845
01:10:09,531 --> 01:10:12,242
"He was always
sure to die anyway."

846
01:10:12,409 --> 01:10:16,126
"But his demise did serve
a purpose of leaving you clues."

847
01:10:16,413 --> 01:10:18,707
"Godspeed, Poe.
Emily weakens by the hour...

848
01:10:18,874 --> 01:10:20,834
... both physically and spiritually."

849
01:10:21,835 --> 01:10:23,353
I will kill him.

850
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:27,692
No matter how this ends,
I will kill this perversion of a man.

851
01:10:28,258 --> 01:10:31,070
"Godspeed"?
Even his prose is barbaric.

852
01:10:31,637 --> 01:10:33,577
Why does he dress him up
like Miss Hamilton?

853
01:10:33,624 --> 01:10:35,858
For the thrill of
watching me suffer.

854
01:10:39,561 --> 01:10:41,552
Here, John.
Bring the light closer.

855
01:10:41,588 --> 01:10:43,082
I think I've found something.

856
01:10:45,818 --> 01:10:46,911
What is that?

857
01:10:47,778 --> 01:10:49,104
Help me turn him over.

858
01:10:55,761 --> 01:10:58,480
I think we've found
our missing sailor.

859
01:11:02,876 --> 01:11:04,216
It's a sextant.

860
01:11:04,503 --> 01:11:06,964
Natural choice for a seaman,
I suppose.

861
01:11:07,131 --> 01:11:09,091
My brother, he went to sea.

862
01:11:09,258 --> 01:11:11,460
A lot of men,
they get these in the Orient.

863
01:11:12,027 --> 01:11:16,282
This notch in the flesh is fresh.
It's still clotted.

864
01:11:16,849 --> 01:11:18,409
The killer did this.

865
01:11:18,976 --> 01:11:21,000
Think it was part of the struggle?

866
01:11:21,928 --> 01:11:24,773
- Too deliberate.
- It's a latitudinal co-ordinate.

867
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:27,259
If you mark the angle of the sun
at its highest point of the day...

868
01:11:27,266 --> 01:11:29,576
... it tells you how far you are
from the equator. North, south.

869
01:11:29,593 --> 01:11:31,530
It's useless without longitude.

870
01:11:33,115 --> 01:11:35,893
Even in the army,
they teach basic navigation.

871
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,170
I went to West Point.

872
01:11:38,537 --> 01:11:40,100
I was expelled, don't worry.

873
01:11:40,414 --> 01:11:41,859
Fields, look there.

874
01:11:45,502 --> 01:11:47,209
Give me a scalpel.

875
01:11:49,101 --> 01:11:50,158
Here.

876
01:12:08,609 --> 01:12:10,362
His tongue has been removed.

877
01:12:13,572 --> 01:12:15,340
And this...

878
01:12:15,507 --> 01:12:17,097
... has replaced it.

879
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:19,369
What is it for?

880
01:12:19,536 --> 01:12:21,106
Longitude.

881
01:12:21,413 --> 01:12:22,673
Pen and paper.

882
01:12:23,670 --> 01:12:25,542
He's giving us a location.

883
01:12:30,296 --> 01:12:32,103
Open up!
Open the door!

884
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,560
Where is Hamilton?

885
01:12:34,827 --> 01:12:36,805
- Hamilton!
- What's happened?

886
01:12:36,862 --> 01:12:39,820
- We need your navigational maps.
- Celestial almanacs as well.

887
01:12:40,057 --> 01:12:42,726
- Why?
- He's gave us the location of Emily.

888
01:12:45,604 --> 01:12:47,439
This watch is mine.

889
01:12:47,586 --> 01:12:49,433
I thought I'd lost it.

890
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,893
- The killer left this?
- On the dead sailor.

891
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:54,479
- In, to be more exact.
- The utter gall.

892
01:12:54,526 --> 01:12:56,655
Along with the
latitudinal co-ordinates.

893
01:12:58,659 --> 01:13:00,005
Incredible.

894
01:13:00,302 --> 01:13:01,389
You must forgive me.

895
01:13:01,392 --> 01:13:04,289
I have no background
in navigational techniques.

896
01:13:04,456 --> 01:13:07,017
To plot an exact position,
you need three things.

897
01:13:07,184 --> 01:13:11,091
A sextant, an accurate chronometer
and a celestial almanac.

898
01:13:13,665 --> 01:13:17,125
The celestial almanac tells us the exact
time at which the sun hits its zenith.

899
01:13:17,192 --> 01:13:18,752
- Exact noon.
- Shall I bring some more...

900
01:13:18,754 --> 01:13:20,908
Leave it!
Please.

901
01:13:20,999 --> 01:13:23,100
It's all right, Percy.
Get another.

902
01:13:25,769 --> 01:13:29,051
If your watch is set to Greenwich
Mean Time, you can calculate...

903
01:13:29,107 --> 01:13:31,833
... how far east or west
of Greenwich, London you are.

904
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:35,562
Twelve... twenty-seven.
Twenty-eight, rather.

905
01:13:35,589 --> 01:13:37,823
- Which one, damn it?
- Twenty-eight.

906
01:13:37,990 --> 01:13:40,125
- Twelve twenty-eight, right?
- Yes.

907
01:13:40,232 --> 01:13:43,078
Longitude is a measure of time
east or west.

908
01:13:43,745 --> 01:13:47,066
Latitude, distance from the equator.
That's north or south.

909
01:13:47,833 --> 01:13:49,503
Seventeen degrees north.

910
01:13:52,045 --> 01:13:54,564
The West Indies?
It can't be.

911
01:13:54,731 --> 01:13:56,718
He couldn't have
transported her that far.

912
01:13:57,895 --> 01:14:00,654
Here.
St Croix.

913
01:14:01,696 --> 01:14:05,392
That's impossible. The Danish
West Indies is a two-week journey.

914
01:14:05,559 --> 01:14:08,570
It's not an island, St Croix.

915
01:14:08,837 --> 01:14:10,589
Holy Cross.

916
01:14:11,056 --> 01:14:12,132
Holy Cross!

917
01:14:12,299 --> 01:14:14,526
Holy Cross Church.
That's our parish.

918
01:14:20,449 --> 01:14:21,892
Giddap!

919
01:14:37,883 --> 01:14:40,135
Cantrell, you and the others
around back.

920
01:14:40,302 --> 01:14:43,238
Spread out. If need be, break
a window. We must get inside!

921
01:14:43,305 --> 01:14:45,757
- Emily!
- Come on!

922
01:15:03,817 --> 01:15:04,993
Emily!

923
01:15:24,793 --> 01:15:26,139
North-west corner!

924
01:15:33,313 --> 01:15:34,383
John!

925
01:15:38,610 --> 01:15:39,829
Don't move, John.

926
01:15:42,996 --> 01:15:43,607
Argh!

927
01:15:43,773 --> 01:15:45,117
He's over here!

928
01:15:47,302 --> 01:15:49,392
There!
Black horse!

929
01:15:52,749 --> 01:15:53,909
Steady.

930
01:15:57,045 --> 01:15:58,705
- Fields?
- Get him!

931
01:15:59,172 --> 01:16:02,067
Find him, Edgar!
Go!

932
01:17:23,222 --> 01:17:24,716
Your name!

933
01:17:24,883 --> 01:17:26,752
You coward!

934
01:17:35,523 --> 01:17:36,990
Who are you?

935
01:18:26,636 --> 01:18:28,030
Poe!

936
01:18:30,115 --> 01:18:31,500
Poe!

937
01:18:39,609 --> 01:18:41,086
The killer escaped.

938
01:18:42,752 --> 01:18:44,171
My horse is gone.

939
01:18:50,929 --> 01:18:54,030
What about Fields?
He was shot.

940
01:18:54,297 --> 01:18:57,324
He's at Doc Clements'.
What of you?

941
01:18:58,351 --> 01:19:00,595
The paper goes to press
in three hours.

942
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:04,391
There was an empty grave.
It had Emily's name on it.

943
01:19:05,308 --> 01:19:08,298
That was his clue.
That's why he sent us there.

944
01:19:09,195 --> 01:19:12,429
Perhaps, or to kill again.

945
01:19:14,159 --> 01:19:16,995
I'm sorry, Poe.
This is my fault.

946
01:19:17,162 --> 01:19:19,564
I should never have gone
ahead with the ball.

947
01:19:19,851 --> 01:19:21,867
These were my stories.

948
01:19:22,414 --> 01:19:25,470
Your daughter's love for me
is the reason another man's dead.

949
01:19:25,837 --> 01:19:27,353
Go to Doc Clements.

950
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:29,357
I have one more story to write.

951
01:19:35,964 --> 01:19:37,499
Edgar...

952
01:19:37,766 --> 01:19:40,268
... for today, she is still alive.

953
01:19:50,654 --> 01:19:52,556
Doctor, let me go!

954
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:55,950
Let me go!
We're running out of time!

955
01:19:56,087 --> 01:19:58,411
For God's sake, you got
a bullet in your chest!

956
01:19:58,428 --> 01:20:01,223
Now lie down and let me do
my job before you bleed to death.

957
01:20:01,990 --> 01:20:04,125
The son of a bitch
is gonna kill her today.

958
01:20:04,292 --> 01:20:07,028
So you cut the bullet out
and you patch me up now!

959
01:20:07,295 --> 01:20:09,624
There's a bottle of whiskey
in the kitchen. Bring it here.

960
01:20:13,501 --> 01:20:15,570
- What the hell is that?
- A magnet.

961
01:20:15,637 --> 01:20:17,822
I need to find the bullet
before I can cut it out.

962
01:20:17,989 --> 01:20:22,372
Soak that pillowcase in the whiskey,
and give the rest to him. He'll need it.

963
01:20:38,301 --> 01:20:40,003
The gossamer white of bone...

964
01:20:40,069 --> 01:20:43,306
... was now visible beneath
the tattered meat of her fingertips...

965
01:20:43,373 --> 01:20:47,157
... as Emily clawed madly
at the wooden slats of her coffin...

966
01:20:47,273 --> 01:20:50,104
... a desperate, drowning animal.

967
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:56,069
The dirt rose around her, the
inescapable sand of an hourglass...

968
01:20:56,116 --> 01:20:57,779
... as her final breath of air...

969
01:20:57,826 --> 01:21:02,342
... slipped her into the twilight
of consciousness until...

970
01:22:38,238 --> 01:22:41,099
He knew now that
all hope was lost.

971
01:22:41,366 --> 01:22:45,895
He had failed his beloved, and
there was but one last thing left to do.

972
01:22:45,952 --> 01:22:47,954
One last act.

973
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:56,556
"A final desperate plea.
One life offered for another's."

974
01:22:56,923 --> 01:22:59,500
Oh, Mr Poe, no... no, you can't!

975
01:22:59,567 --> 01:23:01,906
- Set the print, Ivan.
- But, sir...

976
01:23:01,973 --> 01:23:03,113
Do it!

977
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,421
You can't take it
as your fault, Mr Poe.

978
01:23:06,478 --> 01:23:08,276
Is there someone else
you'd like to blame?

979
01:23:08,883 --> 01:23:10,687
It's the killer who's to blame, sir.

980
01:23:10,854 --> 01:23:13,156
- Let me read that.
- Sir, I need to...

981
01:23:16,234 --> 01:23:20,372
"Poe could feel the poison
already feeding on his blood...

982
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:23,658
... as the maggots were soon to do."

983
01:23:23,825 --> 01:23:25,618
Jesus, Edgar...

984
01:23:25,655 --> 01:23:29,292
- Making enough money, Henry?
- Mr Poe, don't! Mr Poe! Mr Poe!

985
01:23:29,389 --> 01:23:30,908
Will it sell?

986
01:23:30,915 --> 01:23:32,792
- Will it?
- Mr Poe!

987
01:23:32,959 --> 01:23:34,377
You madman!

988
01:23:34,544 --> 01:23:37,792
I'll have you thrown in jail,
you damned animal!

989
01:23:37,839 --> 01:23:40,817
I'll send you to hell!
Huh? Hell!

990
01:23:40,884 --> 01:23:43,611
Mr Poe, don't.
It's not worth it.

991
01:24:11,873 --> 01:24:13,600
Clements!

992
01:24:54,874 --> 01:24:59,185
I'm sorry, Mr Poe. I fell asleep
waiting for you and the Inspector.

993
01:24:59,212 --> 01:25:02,006
- What time is it?
- Just past six, sir.

994
01:25:02,173 --> 01:25:04,000
The paper's here for you.

995
01:25:06,469 --> 01:25:09,839
Rather remarkable seeing that
people are stealing others' papers.

996
01:25:10,706 --> 01:25:12,889
They can't print enough of them
between the election today...

997
01:25:12,896 --> 01:25:15,591
... and this horrible killing
they keep writing about.

998
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:19,560
Here's something else for you,
Mr Poe.

999
01:25:26,364 --> 01:25:30,902
"It is a masterpiece, Mr Poe.
An epitaph worthy of your gifts."

1000
01:25:31,953 --> 01:25:32,965
When did this come?

1001
01:25:32,993 --> 01:25:35,965
I don't know exactly, but before
the paper was delivered.

1002
01:25:36,092 --> 01:25:38,820
- How do you know that?
- It was underneath the paper.

1003
01:25:39,127 --> 01:25:41,412
Impossible.
Look at the streaks in the ink.

1004
01:25:41,509 --> 01:25:43,756
- I don't understand, I'm sorry, Mr Poe.
- It's been rained on.

1005
01:25:43,923 --> 01:25:48,369
- It rained last night before dawn.
- But the newspaper is bone dry.

1006
01:25:48,636 --> 01:25:50,722
I'm not sure what uhm...

1007
01:25:50,888 --> 01:25:54,726
The paper was delivered later,
after it stopped raining.

1008
01:25:54,892 --> 01:25:58,555
This note was written in response
to what I wrote in this newspaper.

1009
01:25:59,122 --> 01:26:02,242
He delivered the note
before the paper.

1010
01:26:03,109 --> 01:26:05,796
So he knew the story in advance.

1011
01:26:08,156 --> 01:26:10,327
He'd already read it.

1012
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:18,716
Where is my gun?

1013
01:26:25,506 --> 01:26:26,650
Damn it.

1014
01:26:44,917 --> 01:26:46,103
The ink.

1015
01:26:55,495 --> 01:26:57,038
It's printing ink.

1016
01:27:00,083 --> 01:27:01,702
The "Patriot".

1017
01:27:09,092 --> 01:27:11,803
Henry, you're gonna tell me
where she is.

1018
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:13,963
Henry!

1019
01:27:16,182 --> 01:27:19,035
Tell me, where is sh...?

1020
01:27:44,001 --> 01:27:45,662
Ivan.

1021
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:54,495
Surprised?

1022
01:27:56,764 --> 01:27:58,441
Where is she?

1023
01:27:59,008 --> 01:28:00,560
Dying.

1024
01:28:01,227 --> 01:28:03,326
More quickly than I expected.

1025
01:28:03,563 --> 01:28:06,791
So I had to speed things along
and deliver the morning edition...

1026
01:28:06,808 --> 01:28:09,610
... so you could finally realise
it had to be...

1027
01:28:09,777 --> 01:28:13,164
... none other than your humble
typesetter and biggest fan.

1028
01:28:16,734 --> 01:28:17,994
A drink?

1029
01:28:22,290 --> 01:28:25,677
You don't know how I've looked
forward to this moment, sir.

1030
01:28:26,043 --> 01:28:27,879
To sit here like this...

1031
01:28:28,045 --> 01:28:29,630
... no more masks...

1032
01:28:29,797 --> 01:28:31,257
... artist to artist.

1033
01:28:31,424 --> 01:28:33,259
Artist to artist.

1034
01:28:33,426 --> 01:28:36,929
Though I admit,
as I read your final chapter...

1035
01:28:37,096 --> 01:28:39,573
... I felt more muse than artist.

1036
01:28:44,145 --> 01:28:45,488
You're mad.

1037
01:28:48,649 --> 01:28:50,385
Really, Mr Poe?

1038
01:28:51,652 --> 01:28:53,463
You're one to talk.

1039
01:28:55,189 --> 01:28:59,452
- Where is Emily?
- Where is Emily?

1040
01:28:59,619 --> 01:29:01,446
Just like that?

1041
01:29:02,413 --> 01:29:07,010
No probing the devious twists
and turns of man's darkest motives?

1042
01:29:07,476 --> 01:29:10,313
No prying into the mysteries
of his conscience?

1043
01:29:10,429 --> 01:29:12,006
So very unlike you, Mr Poe.

1044
01:29:12,548 --> 01:29:13,775
Where is she?

1045
01:29:14,842 --> 01:29:15,919
Ow!

1046
01:29:18,212 --> 01:29:21,870
A rather disappointing
dénouement, I have to say.

1047
01:29:22,716 --> 01:29:25,002
But that's life, isn't it?

1048
01:29:25,269 --> 01:29:27,980
So much less satisfying
than fiction.

1049
01:29:28,147 --> 01:29:30,424
It's time this story
comes to an end.

1050
01:29:31,525 --> 01:29:33,011
Very well.

1051
01:29:33,778 --> 01:29:35,372
Give me the gun.

1052
01:29:37,898 --> 01:29:41,460
You've come this far, Mr Poe.
Are you really gonna back out now?

1053
01:29:42,662 --> 01:29:46,132
You know what happens next.
You are the one who wrote it, after all.

1054
01:29:47,159 --> 01:29:50,688
You either pull that trigger and
kill me and young Miss Emily...

1055
01:29:50,755 --> 01:29:52,807
... or you give me the gun.

1056
01:29:54,048 --> 01:29:58,386
- She will live.
- That was your solution, right?

1057
01:30:10,898 --> 01:30:14,401
I have to admit,
I don't cry easily, but...

1058
01:30:14,487 --> 01:30:17,222
... you had me bawling like a baby.

1059
01:30:18,199 --> 01:30:20,307
And I've always had a fancy
for poisons.

1060
01:30:20,384 --> 01:30:22,251
That's how I done my dad.

1061
01:30:22,398 --> 01:30:24,929
The idea of drinking something
that will kill you...

1062
01:30:24,996 --> 01:30:27,390
... but having time
to carry on a conversation...

1063
01:30:27,406 --> 01:30:31,336
... is, as they say, fraught
with dramatic possibilities, right?

1064
01:30:32,103 --> 01:30:35,164
Listen to me, talking about
dramatic possibilities...

1065
01:30:35,191 --> 01:30:38,125
... with one of the greatest
writers of our time.

1066
01:30:38,742 --> 01:30:43,255
But I must say, it has been a profound
honour working with you, sir.

1067
01:30:43,739 --> 01:30:45,666
Working with me?

1068
01:30:46,033 --> 01:30:48,736
I know they're your ideas.
I'm just borrowing.

1069
01:30:49,103 --> 01:30:51,772
Except for Valdemar's tongue.
That was me.

1070
01:30:51,939 --> 01:30:54,942
- Quite a subtle metaphor, I thought.
- Subtle?

1071
01:30:55,109 --> 01:30:56,986
It made no sense at all.

1072
01:30:57,153 --> 01:31:00,714
Even in the end,
I'm confronted by a plagiarist...

1073
01:31:00,781 --> 01:31:04,143
... without even the originality
to invent themselves.

1074
01:31:04,410 --> 01:31:06,165
I've concocted you.

1075
01:31:06,762 --> 01:31:08,573
I couldn't agree more.

1076
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:12,251
I am your crowning achievement.

1077
01:31:12,418 --> 01:31:14,220
Your masterpiece.

1078
01:31:15,287 --> 01:31:18,924
In whose world do we each
exist right now, Edgar?

1079
01:31:19,021 --> 01:31:21,985
Mine, or yours?

1080
01:31:22,803 --> 01:31:24,997
I don't really know the answer.

1081
01:31:26,098 --> 01:31:28,189
It's quite brilliant.

1082
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:32,463
Well... go on, sir.

1083
01:31:37,068 --> 01:31:38,504
Bottoms up.

1084
01:31:45,659 --> 01:31:47,219
I need a carriage now!

1085
01:31:47,286 --> 01:31:49,029
- Inspector!
- I need a carriage.

1086
01:31:49,076 --> 01:31:51,415
And send a messenger
to Charles Hamilton's house.

1087
01:31:51,422 --> 01:31:54,458
Tell him to get to the
"Baltimore Patriot". Do it!

1088
01:32:05,755 --> 01:32:10,684
So it has been written:
I will die today.

1089
01:32:12,770 --> 01:32:15,748
A hole of mouldering
earth awaits.

1090
01:32:15,815 --> 01:32:20,286
It is a just end to a man
consumed by death his entire life.

1091
01:32:20,653 --> 01:32:24,031
Emily, take this kiss
upon thy brow.

1092
01:32:24,198 --> 01:32:26,018
Really good stuff, sir.

1093
01:32:27,284 --> 01:32:29,069
A poet to the end.

1094
01:32:30,788 --> 01:32:33,182
I suppose this bit
is for Miss Hamilton.

1095
01:32:34,291 --> 01:32:35,735
Where is she?

1096
01:32:37,128 --> 01:32:39,839
Where is she?
I tell you, Mr Poe...

1097
01:32:40,005 --> 01:32:43,351
... I used to live for your stories,
just live for them.

1098
01:32:43,717 --> 01:32:46,137
When you stopped writing...

1099
01:32:47,888 --> 01:32:49,857
... I guess I went a little nuts.

1100
01:32:50,224 --> 01:32:53,394
But I kept on believing,
even when you closed me out.

1101
01:32:53,521 --> 01:32:55,312
I still believed in your vision...

1102
01:32:55,479 --> 01:32:57,918
... in a future where people
would stand in lines...

1103
01:32:57,965 --> 01:33:01,262
... to see the kind of things that
only people like you and I could see.

1104
01:33:03,128 --> 01:33:05,885
I knew you had
one more in you, sir.

1105
01:33:08,826 --> 01:33:11,003
No one will ever forget you.

1106
01:33:16,917 --> 01:33:18,752
Have you ever been to France?

1107
01:33:18,919 --> 01:33:21,906
There's a young writer
over there, Jules Verne.

1108
01:33:22,173 --> 01:33:24,208
- You heard of him?
- What?

1109
01:33:24,525 --> 01:33:25,986
Paris.

1110
01:33:26,827 --> 01:33:29,221
He really reminds me of you, sir.

1111
01:33:29,488 --> 01:33:32,533
Where is she? You owe me!
Where is she?

1112
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:35,269
"Anything was better
than this agony."

1113
01:33:35,436 --> 01:33:38,572
"Anything was more tolerable
than this derision."

1114
01:33:38,939 --> 01:33:42,535
"I could bear those hypocritical
smiles no longer."

1115
01:33:42,752 --> 01:33:44,900
"The Tell-Tale Heart."

1116
01:33:45,321 --> 01:33:48,799
She's here... she's here.

1117
01:33:49,705 --> 01:33:53,288
- Carriage for Mr Reynolds!
- On my way in just a moment.

1118
01:33:54,595 --> 01:33:55,865
Goodbye, Mr Poe.

1119
01:33:58,792 --> 01:34:00,878
I've enjoyed our time together.

1120
01:34:03,255 --> 01:34:04,815
Reynolds...

1121
01:34:13,774 --> 01:34:15,150
Almost...

1122
01:35:04,306 --> 01:35:06,026
Emily!

1123
01:35:16,620 --> 01:35:18,272
Emily?

1124
01:35:19,039 --> 01:35:20,425
Answer me.

1125
01:35:23,002 --> 01:35:26,030
Emily!
Please, answer me!

1126
01:35:36,265 --> 01:35:38,025
Oh, my God.

1127
01:36:05,107 --> 01:36:06,764
Emily...

1128
01:37:07,564 --> 01:37:09,942
Emily... Emily...

1129
01:37:24,658 --> 01:37:26,287
Emily.

1130
01:37:26,734 --> 01:37:28,389
Open your eyes.

1131
01:37:28,834 --> 01:37:31,889
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes.

1132
01:37:32,256 --> 01:37:34,391
Emily, open your eyes.

1133
01:37:36,093 --> 01:37:38,053
Yeah.

1134
01:37:42,808 --> 01:37:44,793
Oh, yeah.

1135
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:47,163
Is it really you?

1136
01:37:50,149 --> 01:37:53,350
- I love you.
- I love you.

1137
01:37:56,405 --> 01:37:57,749
I'm here.

1138
01:37:58,615 --> 01:38:00,223
I came for you.

1139
01:38:03,036 --> 01:38:04,822
Okay.

1140
01:38:11,895 --> 01:38:13,039
Stay awake.

1141
01:38:14,006 --> 01:38:16,283
I have you, always.

1142
01:38:17,593 --> 01:38:19,278
We're going home.

1143
01:38:19,845 --> 01:38:23,182
- You did mean it?
- Mean what?

1144
01:38:23,228 --> 01:38:25,796
When you said
you would marry me.

1145
01:38:25,853 --> 01:38:27,930
In this life and the next.

1146
01:38:32,291 --> 01:38:34,793
Clear the way!
Clear the way!

1147
01:38:34,840 --> 01:38:36,672
What's wrong with you?
Make way!

1148
01:38:36,759 --> 01:38:39,106
- Where is Poe?
- He was here a moment ago.

1149
01:38:39,523 --> 01:38:40,908
Poe!

1150
01:38:41,074 --> 01:38:42,218
Hurry!

1151
01:38:46,538 --> 01:38:49,066
Where is Edgar?
Where is Edgar?

1152
01:38:49,533 --> 01:38:50,768
Now, be careful.

1153
01:38:51,535 --> 01:38:52,665
Go, go, go!

1154
01:39:16,902 --> 01:39:18,120
Sir?

1155
01:39:18,487 --> 01:39:20,689
You are Edgar Poe, correct?

1156
01:39:22,825 --> 01:39:24,451
I am.

1157
01:39:25,619 --> 01:39:27,552
For a few more minutes, anyway.

1158
01:39:27,679 --> 01:39:30,891
Are you all right? I mean, you
look a little the worse for wear.

1159
01:39:30,958 --> 01:39:33,201
Is there someone
I can call for you?

1160
01:39:34,419 --> 01:39:37,406
- Reynolds.
- You want me to find Reynolds?

1161
01:39:37,422 --> 01:39:39,224
Does he have a first name?

1162
01:39:39,591 --> 01:39:40,776
No.

1163
01:39:42,344 --> 01:39:46,740
Tell Fields...
his last name is Reynolds.

1164
01:39:47,507 --> 01:39:50,857
I'm sorry, sir,
you're not making much sense.

1165
01:39:55,858 --> 01:39:57,961
Tell Fields.

1166
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:07,594
The Lord help my poor soul.

1167
01:40:47,993 --> 01:40:49,562
Mr Fields?

1168
01:40:50,329 --> 01:40:53,181
- I'm Dr John Morgan.
- Doctor.

1169
01:40:53,874 --> 01:40:56,854
- Do you have a cause of death?
- I'm sorry, I don't.

1170
01:40:56,865 --> 01:40:59,157
I have a few ideas, but...

1171
01:40:59,354 --> 01:41:02,549
As you know, he was brought in
in a very deranged state.

1172
01:41:02,716 --> 01:41:04,876
I'm told he was ranting.

1173
01:41:04,943 --> 01:41:06,103
Yes.

1174
01:41:06,470 --> 01:41:11,008
He kept going on and on about telling
you that your last name is Reynolds.

1175
01:41:11,224 --> 01:41:13,869
Is that helpful, or just gibberish?

1176
01:41:14,116 --> 01:41:15,771
Maybe both.

1177
01:41:18,231 --> 01:41:21,752
Well, thank you
for your help, Doctor.

1178
01:41:21,818 --> 01:41:24,529
I'd be interested in hearing
your final analysis.

1179
01:41:29,284 --> 01:41:32,577
Take this kiss upon thy brow...

1180
01:41:32,604 --> 01:41:38,210
... and in parting from you now,
thus much let me avow.

1181
01:41:38,307 --> 01:41:44,216
You are not wrong, who deem
that my days have been a dream.

1182
01:41:44,383 --> 01:41:49,846
All that we see or seem
is but a dream within a dream.

1183
01:41:57,606 --> 01:42:00,704
Mr Reynolds, please
follow me to your carriage.

1184
01:42:28,677 --> 01:42:30,063
Merci pour votre aide.

1185
01:42:34,458 --> 01:42:35,993
