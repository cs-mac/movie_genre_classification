78
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,660

80

No, no. You didn't.

About that 182.5 billion won...

83
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:56,520
Let's say borough office is going
to take care of 100 billion won.

84
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,720
So we have to collect 82.5 billion won.

85
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:05,450
If we divide that amongst Teams 1,
2 and 3, it's 27.5 billion each.

86
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:11,310
The amount that Section Chief's Team 3
collected in the first half of 2016

You should work harder.
You should work very hard.

94

Hurry up and eat.

95
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,160

97
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:07,620
I think I should eat after

98
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,540
I finish collecting taxes, sir.

99
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,290
Why? You should eat first.

100
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,530
No, no...

101
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,240

Yes?

110
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,330
On our list, who owes
the greatest amount in arrears?

111
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:13,310
<i>Hey, you. You should have checked
the balance before you sent it!</i>

112
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,960
What are you going to do now? Huh?

113
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,470
What's the matter?

114
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,890
<i>Are you a child?
How could you get scammed?</i>

115
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,800
His name is Ma Jin Seok.

116
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,530
He owes 520 million won in local taxes
and 5.25 billion won in federal taxes.

117
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,090
He's on our blacklist.

118
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,830
Okay.

119
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,720
We investigated him a little bit
and uncovered that list.

120
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,230
We slapped a travel ban on him
and cut off all of his credit cards.

121
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,420
Still, he's not flinching.

122
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,010
It says he lives in Cheorwon, Gangwon-do.

123
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,890
But that's not his actual home, right?
What's his real address?

124
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:48,250
He lives in those Premium Apartments
in Cheongsam-dong.

125
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,000
I heard that apartments in that complex
go for about 1.5 billion won per unit.

126
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:53,770
Okay.

127
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,380

129
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,040

his house right away.

130
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:04,060
So everyone, let's get ready to leave.

131
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:05,680

- Yes.

132
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,940
Sung Hee, take these documents with you.

133
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,270
Hey hey, Sung Il.

134
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,760
Yes, sir?

135
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,710
Why?

136
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,470
What's wrong?

137
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,190
Do you...

139
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,740
five million won?

140
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,650
Five million won?
No, I don't...

141
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,790
Why, why, why? Why do you need that?

142
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,200
I got scammed.

143
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,640
You got scammed?

144
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,460
Not just me.

145
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,430
Chief Director Yoon, Han, and Jo.

146
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,830
We all got scammed.

147
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,030
Oh, so that's what all the commotion
was about. What's going on?

148
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:51,170
What am I supposed to do now?
If my wife finds out, I'll be a dead man.

149
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:54,160
How could you get scammed?
Come on, Brother...

150
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,580
You won't know how I'm feeling
until it happens to you.

151
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,220
At that moment,
you have no idea that it's a scam.

152

people into things.</i>

00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,310
that I could do.

155
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,950
Geez, you...

156
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,420
I have to leave now. Let's talk later.

157
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,190
And don't worry too much about your wife.

158
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,310
She won't kill you. You're her husband.

159
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,870
I'll off. Let's talk later.

160
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,930
- We should make it quick.
- Okay.

161
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,820
How could that happen?

162
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,360
Director Ahn could have fallen for it.

163
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,650
But Director Yoon doesn't seem like
the type to get in this kind of trouble.

164
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,600
You know, he questions everything.

165
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,760
Hey, Director Han's wife got scammed too.

166
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,120
Innocent and foolish people
get scammed all the time.

167
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,890
How could they get fooled like that?

168
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:06,500
Section Chief is the most innocent
and foolish person here.

169
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,020
Are you crazy?

170
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,910
No, sir.

171
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,290
Getting scammed at least once is okay.

172
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,200
It teaches you where you stand.

173
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,820
That's how it was for me.

174
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,000
Where is everyone?

175
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:46,990
Our team went out for an arrest warrant.
And Team 3 is out on location.

176
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,700
Whose house are they searching?
They need an entire team for that?

177
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,470
I'm not sure about his name.

178
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,080
Of all the people Team 3
is responsible for

179
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,060
I was told that he has
the greatest volume owed in arrears.

180
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,060
What?

181
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:08,770
Oh, President Jung.

182
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,920
I told you this already.

183
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,680
I told you I can multiply
that dollar amount, by 20.

184
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,450
Why won't you trust me?

185
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,460
Yes.

186
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,680
Hold on. I have another call.

187
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,440
Wow!

188
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,130
Long time, no talk.

189
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,200
How have you been?

190
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,130
What?

191
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,660
Ma'am.

192
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,190
Where is my cell phone?

193
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,380
It's right here.

194
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yes?

195
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,930
Hey. Why don't you answer your phone?

196
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,910
I called you a bunch of times.

197
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,100
<i>Why? What's the matter?</i>

198
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,710
People from City Hall
are coming to collect taxes.

199
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,710
What?

200
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,340
This is it, right?

201
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,410
Yes, it's the top floor.

202
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,870
The public officials are here.

203
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,780
They're all here.

204
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,390
Let's go.

205
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,270
What is it? What's the matter?

206
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,340
They're going to block us.

207
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,260
The news got out.

208
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,390
We're from the City Hall.
Please step aside.

209
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,950
No visitors allowed.

210
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,220
Okay, I got it.

211
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,050
He said that they're
in the lobby. What do I do?

212
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,250
<i>Okay, listen. Listen carefully.</i>

213
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,260
Hide any valuables at all
that are in the apartment.

214
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,950
What if they find it?

215
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:22,950
<i>What do I do then?</i>

216
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,070
Don't worry about that.
Just do what I tell you.

217
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,180
It's going to get dark soon.

218
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,250
It's illegal to search
the house after sundown.

219
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,880
<i>Okay? Just hide everything.</i>

220
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,160
And wait until the sun sets.
I'll be there soon.

221
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,190
This is obstruction of justice.
Step aside, everyone.

222
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,640
I told you guys to leave.

223
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,940
<i>[KANG HO JOONG]</i>

224
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,280
Let's just break through them.

225
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,300
I just said, all of you, step back!

226
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,990
- Did you just hit me?
- Step aside!

227
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,820
This one.

228
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,960
- In the oven. In the oven.
- In the oven.

229
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,340
In the microwave. The microwave!

230
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,630
Sung Hee, quickly! Quickly!

231
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,630
In the toilet, the toilet.

232
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,410
Sofa, sofa. Sofa!

233
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,960
Ma'am, lift this mattress.
Lift it up. Lift it.

234
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,960
Lift it up more, won't you?

00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,450
Is anyone there?

237
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,990
I'm from City Hall.

238
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,110
Where are you from?

239
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,430
- I'm from City Hall.
- <i>City Hall?</i>

240
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,200
<i>Why did you come here?</i>

241
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,560
This is Mr. Ma Jin Seok's house, right?

242
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,940
Okay, you can come in.

243
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,720
I got the door open.

244
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,170
When you go in there

245
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:11,880
you should search closets,
washing machines, and cabinets first.

246
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,420
That's where they hide the valuables.

247
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,150
- Okay.
- I got it.

248
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,990
Use as many confiscation stickers as
possible. We'll be auctioning this stuff.

249
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,640
- Yes.
- I got it.

250
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,560
<i>Excuse me!</i>

251
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,110
Hello.

252
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,430
I'm from Sungwon City Hall's
Taxation Department.

253
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,150
It looks like Mr. Ma Jin Seok isn't home.

254
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,110
What's your relationship
with him? Wife...

255
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,130
What?

256
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,610
Oh... Yes.

257
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,200
Didn't you get divorced?

258
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,910
You guys still live together,
after getting divorced?

259
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,790
Are you aware that your husband,
Ma Jin Seok, has failed to pay

260
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:53,030
520 million won in local taxes,
and 5.25 billion won in federal taxes?

261
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:57,960
That comes to about 5.77 billion won.

262
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,170
That's his business.

263
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,810
About the 520 million in local taxes...

264
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,480
He seems to be very rich.
Why wouldn't he pay his taxes?

265
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,540
Be quiet. Hurry up.

266
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,930
We'll be searching the house and
formalizing this as distressed property.

267
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,230
- Start it.
- Okay.

268
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,010
Excuse us.

269
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,630
Well...

270
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,800
Here, search this sofa.

271
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,320
Section Chief.

272
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,030
- Take them all out.
- Okay.

273
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,140
Put the sofa back together.

274
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,170
Those are all fake. Imitation.

275
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,210
Even if you take them,
you won't be able to sell them.

276
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,800
Okay, I understand.

277
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,200
There's nothing in there.

278
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,030
Do you usually

279
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,910
wash these in the washing machine?

280
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,480
There it is.

281
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,690
Wow, she really scattered
everything, everywhere.

282
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,030
Take them all out.

283
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:39,960
Excuse me. Can I have some water?

284
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,920
Okay.

285
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,060
Thank you.

286
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:47,460
The ones that have stickers on them,
we're putting up for auction.

287
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,470
If you don't want them revoked,
pay your taxes.

288
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,010
What are you guys doing?

289
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:00,090
Hey.

290
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,240
Why didn't you answer your phone?

291
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,220
I didn't get any calls.

292
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,220
You got no calls?

293
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,920
Do you see this?

294
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,700
I didn't buy you a phone for you
to check the time. Right?

295
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,140
- Mr. Ma Jin Seok?
- Yes.

296
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,420
We're from City Hall,
of the Seowon Taxation Department.

297
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:34,900
We're conducting a search on your house,
because of your delinquent tax records.

298
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,060
Isn't it illegal to search
a house after sunset?

299
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:41,280
It's dark outside.
What are you doing in my house?

300
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,450
Ma'am!

301
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,280
What are you doing?

302
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Come here.

303
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,020
Who told you to give them water?
Isn't this my water?

304
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,020
This is expensive water, Ma'am.

305
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,680
Why are you giving them
my water, without my permission?

306
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,270
I'm sorry, President Ma.

307
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,370
Geez...

308
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,850
Ma'am.

309
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,650
How much do you earn, per month?

310
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:22,210
- 1.8 million won.
- 1.8 million won?

311
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:25,590
Drink that.

312
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,550
If you drink all of that,
I'll give you another one million.

313
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,820
What do you think?

314
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:36,870
Let's give it a try.
I would do it if I were you.

315
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:40,240
- Excuse me.
- Wait a second. What are you doing?

316
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,690
You stay out of this.

317
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:44,880
Are you going to drink it
or are you not going to drink it?

318
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,980
You said that you have
a kid to send to college.

319
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,870
Hurry up and drink it.

320
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,100
Quickly, drink it.

321
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:57,370
- Ma'am.
- Ma'am.

322
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,470
- Don't drink it.
- I'm okay.

323
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,690
Hey, you.

324
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,610
Can you see where you stand?

325
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,630
This is money.

326
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,340
Money looks something like this.

327
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,480
When you stick these on

328
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,380
you feel like you're doing
something amazing, yeah?

329
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,450
Huh?

330
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,450
You're not...

331
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:36,370
This Madam, and you guys, are all same.

332
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:42,100
You guys give up everything,
for a little bit of money.

333
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,070
Here. Take this.

334
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:47,780
Take this. You guys laid it out
for me very nicely.

335
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,580
Take these too.
Hey! Take some of that too!

336
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,800
Take it! Why aren't you taking it?

337
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,340
What in the world are you doing?

338
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,440
You don't even pay your taxes.
You can't waste your money like this.

339
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,680
- We'll teach you a lesson.
- A lesson?

340
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,240
What in the world is this bastard saying?

341
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,470
- Bastard? You better watch your mouth.
- You better watch your mouth.

342
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,190
You think that the law is on your side?

343
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:12,720
Is that you why have the nerve
to say something like that?

344
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,260
Okay. Let's just say, for fun,
the law is on your side.

345
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,490
In that case

346
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:19,070
the seven buildings in Dangjin
that I gave to my younger brother.

347
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,580
The four apartments in Gangnam
that I transferred to my Mother.

348
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:26,440
And 30,000 pyeong of land in Yongin
that I transferred to my fake divorcee.

349
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,320
Why couldn't you seize them from me?

350
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,990
You knew that they were all mine.
Why couldn't you seize them?

351
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,970
- Hey, you.
- You clearly knew those are mine.

352
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,080
Why couldn't you seize them?

353
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,530
- Don't be like this, Mr. Ma!
- Why not, huh?

354
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:40,150
Listen to me.
The law likes money too.

355
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,540
The law is for the rich.

356
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,190
Do you understand what I'm saying?

357
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:56,210

358
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,490
Okay, I got it. So stop it,
and step aside please.

359
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:02,490
Stop what?

360
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,080
Did I force her to do that?

361
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,010
She said she would do that.

362
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,960
Geez, that's gross.

363
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,110
- Are you okay?
- Ma'am!

364
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,760
If you spill it, that's a foul.

365
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,990
Do you want to start over?

366
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:16,880
She's your mother's age!
What are you doing?

367
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,580
She is not my mom.

368
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,330
And how could I stop her?

369
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,700
You stop her if you can, you beggar.

370
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,460
Who are you calling a beggar?

371
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,890
I can't take this anymore.

372
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,220
- Hey, stop it.
- No, no, no.

373
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:31,610
- Hit me, you bastard.
- Don't!

374
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:35,100
- How old are you, you jerk?
- Don't do it.

375
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,740
Don't talk down to me like that!

376
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,610
What in the world is he saying?

377
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,420
Bring me your
birth certificate! Bring it!

378
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,110
Birth certificate? Here you go.

379
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,110
Hey! Let go of me!

380
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,820
Here, take a look at it.

381
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,080
What are you doing?

382
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,080
What are you?

383
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,910
Jin Seok!

384
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,130
Jin Seok!

385
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,450
Yes?

386
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,920
Where is Section Chief Seo Il
from Team 3?

387
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,420
Chief Director Ahn is here.

388
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,280
Section Chief Sung Il.

389
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,480
Yes.

390
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:14,160
Baek Sung Il, how many years have you
been working in the Taxation Department?

391
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:18,100
It's been eight years, sir.

392
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,230
Eight years?

393
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,730
It has been a while.

394
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,740
Why did you do that?

395
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,770
Eight years, you've been on this job.

396
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,430
I'm sorry.

397
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,280
Tell Chief Director Ahn to come in.

398
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:52,530
Where are you going?

399
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,520
I thought you told me
to get Chief Director Ahn.

400
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,380
<i>Chief Director Ahn is coming in.</i>

401
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,380
The intercom...

402
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,500
Baek Sung Il.

403
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,360
Yes?

404
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,840
Let's do it right. Okay?

405
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,310
Yes.

406
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,830
Investigate it thoroughly and refer back
to the disciplinary committee.

408
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,970
You haven't gone home yet?

409
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:22,970
No, not yet.

410
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,180
What did they say?

411
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:29,070
You know, the obvious stuff.

412
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:32,840
The disciplinary committee?

413
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,830
So, Section Chief...

414
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:40,980
You should control your temper.

415
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:44,180
Usually, it isn't a problem.
But sometimes, you get...

416
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:48,690
I don't want to be like that either.
But it's not that easy.

417
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:51,000
I have to pick up my daughter.
I'm going home.

418
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,070
You should head home too.

419
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:57,410
We'll share the blame.

420
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:00,120
Then, they won't suspend you! So...

421
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,820
- Dad.
- Yes?

422
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:14,530
I study really hard. I don't even sleep.

423
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:17,170
But why are my grades always the same?

424
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:19,380
Huh? Why do you think that is?

425
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:24,280
- Maybe other kids are studying harder.
- Geez, stop eating!

426
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:28,390
And, don't answer me so carelessly.

427
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:31,320
Why aren't my grades getting better?

428
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,420
Only three kids are doing worse than me.

429
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:36,180
But all three of them
are on the taekwondo team.

430
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:39,330
They even missed a day of testing.

431
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,160
What's wrong with me?

432
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,970
What I think is that...

433
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:49,790
there are too many
geniuses in your class.

434
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,860
- Really?
- That's right. It's not your fault.

435
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,470
They're just too smart.
There's nothing you can do about that.

436
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:56,260
I'm in the same boat.

437
00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:00,200
I always work very hard,
but my team is always behind everyone.

438
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,780
And my salary stays the same.

439
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,860
You're like that too?

440
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,860
Of course.

441
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,780
Oh, it's because I take after you.

442
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,410
That's right, it's okay.

443
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,410
Oh, my.

444
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,840
Geez. Are you okay? You're all wet.

445
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,910
Ji Eun, are you okay?

446
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,880
Oh, Ah Jung?

447
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,310
- Is she your friend?
- Yes, we're in the same class.

448
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,120
Are you okay?

449
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,280
We meet again.

450
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,080
I guess you don't have a car.

451
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:46,370
Why are you walking,
out here in the rain?

452
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:50,370
Geez... you're soaked.

453
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:52,090
I'm sorry.

454
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,920
No, actually, I can't just say sorry.
That's not enough.

455
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,030
Let's go.

456
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,030
Geez...

457
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:10,530
Oh, my.

458
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:13,660
I thought these were 10,000 won bills...

459
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,370
I almost made a mistake.

460
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,740
Is this enough?

461
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,070
Take it. This is enough
for dry cleaning, right?

462
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:25,080
Thanks, but it's okay.

463
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,150
Take it back. Let's go.

464
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:30,970
Really? I guess I don't
have a choice then.

465
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:34,520
Let's call it even.
Your punch, and my splash.

466
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,130
Okay?

467
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,520
Oh.

468
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,090
And

469
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:50,630
when you have a chance, buy a car.

470
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:55,130
She must be tired from studying all day.
Why do you make her walk?

471
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:58,100
Aren't you embarrassed,
in front of your own daughter?

472
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,790
You know, there are many cars out there.

473
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:02,700
All it needs is four wheels to be a car.

474
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,840
I'll get going. Bye, kiddo.

475
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,010
Dad, are you okay?

476
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,620
Honey.

477
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:43,360
What do you think about
getting another car?

478
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,420
Don't you think it would be
better for Ji Eun and Mom?

479
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,380
Are you picking a fight?

480
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:57,950
Geez, I'm very tired.

481
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,380
It would be nice to have a car.

482
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,380
Go to sleep.

483
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,810
Oh, that's right.

Brother.

488
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,700
Hello?

489
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,520
<i>Hello. I saw your post
on the car swap website.</i>

490
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,460
- Yes, yes.
<i>- You're looking for an Avance MD?</i>

491
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,970
Yes, that's right.

<i>I'm hoping that we can
work out a price together.</i>

494
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:32,480
How much do you want for your car?

495
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,130
<i>It's a 2012 model, and it has
just over 50,000 kilometers on it.</i>

498
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,670
Really?

499
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,240
You're going to sell it
for five million won?

500
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:53,450
<i>Yes. I think I could give it
to you for five million won.</i>

501
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:00,170
But... why are you selling it so cheap?

502
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:01,770
Is there a problem with the car?

503
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:03,230
<i>There's nothing wrong with the car.</i>

504
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:07,840
<i>Well... Are you not
satisfied with the price?</i>

505
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,550
No, no, that's not it.

506
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,230
It's not a million or two million won.

507
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:13,660
You're telling me you're going to
cut the price by three million won.

508
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:17,220
<i>I guess that's it then.

2012 Avance.

514
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,210
Five million won.
He says he's going to give it to me...

515
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:46,670
for five million won.
Isn't that too cheap? Is that okay?

516
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,250
Is it a direct deal?

517
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:49,860
It should be okay
if it's a direct deal, right?

518
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:53,080
I think you should check it out,
but it should be okay.

519
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:56,120
Five million won for a direct deal.
I think it should be fine.

520
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:59,460
That's right. You need to
see the car first though.

521
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,470
Yes.

522
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:02,850
Yeah, right... Right?

523
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:06,320
Okay.

524
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:13,040
Yes, hello?

525
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,620
Yeah, then...
Can I take a look at the car first?

526
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:20,820
<i>Oh, I'm sorry sir...</i>

527
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,440
Why? Did you sell it already?

528
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,450
<i>No, no.</i>

529
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:26,220
Not that. Something came up.

530
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:30,500
I think my Brother will be there.

531
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,760
Oh, really? So what should I do?

532
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,580
<i>He's going to show you the car,
so you can check out anything you need.</i>

533
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:40,810
I... borrowed some money from him...

534
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:44,360
<i>I'm going to ask you to not bring up
the price around him, and whatnot.</i>

535
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,800
Oh, what's so hard about that?

536
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:52,070
Okay, then. So should I call you
after I take a look at the car?

537
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:55,200
<i>- Yes, that would be okay.</i>
- Okay.

538
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,350
I'll call you after I see the car.

539
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:59,210
- Okay.
<i>- Okay.</i>

540
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,070
- Sir, is this... Direct deal?
- No.

541
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,840
- By any chance, this car...
- Oh, yes.

542
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,850
- I should take a look at the car.
- Yes, go ahead.

543
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,550
You haven't been in any accidents, right?

544
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:48,660
Of course not.

545
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,200
You could go see a mechanic later.

546
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,350
No, no, it's not that
I don't trust you. I'm just checking.

547
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:55,240
Yes, thank you.

548
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,510
- Great, thank you.
- Sure.

549
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:58,510
Let me call somebody.

550
00:43:58,510 --> 00:43:59,510
Okay.

551
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:04,720
Yes, hello?

552
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,530
I just saw the car.

553
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,310
<i>Do you like it?</i>

554
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:11,010
I like it very much.

555
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:13,810
Actually, will it be possible
for me to buy the car today?

556
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:16,610
<i>I'll tell you my bank account number.</i>

557
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,700
Bank account number?
Are we not meeting in person?

558
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,690
I'm quite far from there. It might
be hard for us to meet in person.

559
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:25,700
You checked out the car, right?

560
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,410
Yes, I did. But we have to take care
of the papers and stuff, right?

561
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:32,680
<i>My brother has the car registration
and the contract.</i>

562
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,750
<i>I think you should
check it out for yourself.</i>

563
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:37,680
- Oh...
- Yes.

564
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,060
Oh...

565
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,660
Yes, then. Let's do that.

566
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:49,360
Send me your account number then.
I'll send you the money right away.

567
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:52,590
<i>Welcome. Select your option.</i>

568
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:57,780
<i>Watch out for any scammers

569
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:01,350
<i>Enter the amount to transfer.</i>

570
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:07,900
<i>The following amount will
be taken from your account.</i>

<i>If the following information is correct,
please press "Continue".</i>

<i>If not, please press "Cancel".</i>

573
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:17,110
<i>Your transaction has been completed.</i>

574
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:25,160
<i>- The number you have dialed...</i>
- Why isn't he answering his phone?

575
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:31,700
<i>The phone has been turned off...</i>

576
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:36,750
<i>How could you get scammed?
What a pity.</i>

577
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,650
<i>At that moment,
you have no idea that it's a scam.</i>

578
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:41,670
<i>He's great at talking people into things.</i>

579
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:00,480
Oh, wait! Stop!

580
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:02,990
Stop, stop!

581
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:03,990
What happened?

582
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:09,470
Where's your Brother now?

583
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:10,590
What?

584
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:15,180
The owner of this car. I talked to him
on the phone. Where is he now?

585
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:18,470
What did you say?
What are you talking about?

586
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:19,850
I'm the owner of this car.

587
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:21,730
- But...
- This is my car!

588
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:25,210
What? What are you...

589
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:28,080
Hold on. Wait a minute! Wait!

590
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,830
What's the matter now?

591
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,810
- Hello?
<i>- Did you...</i>

592
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:33,810
<i>get your car keys?</i>

593
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,900
<i>You're not buying
some cheap t-shirts here.</i>

594
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:46,900
Are you a fool?

595
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:52,270
<i>You should have seen the person
before sending your money.</i>

596
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:59,370
<i>How could you be so naive, at your age?</i>

597
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:02,120
<i>From now on, don't do any
direct deals for cars.</i>

598
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:06,450
<i>Buy your cars at the dealership,
and buy your clothes at the store.</i>

599
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:10,560
But, sir. Sir?

600
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,560
That money... Hello? Hello?

601
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,320
That money is very important to me.

602
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,630
I saved it up for my daughter.

603
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:22,130
You can't do this.

604
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,340
I... I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

605
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,450
I shouldn't have done
any direct deals online.

606
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:31,390
<i>No... Hey, no. You're young.
You can't do this to me!</i>

607
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:35,850
Hey you. Give that money...
Give that money back, you punk!

608
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:38,460
<i>You must be very angry, our naive mister.</i>

609
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:41,760
I should at least give you
some of the money.

610
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,840
<i>That man won't give you the car.
So don't make a fuss over it.</i>

611
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:45,880
<i>It will only make you look bad.</i>

612
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:49,740
You can take the same taxi you took
to get there, to get home.

<i>Have a safe trip.</i>

615
00:47:58,110 --> 00:48:00,820
Thank you for your money, sir.

616
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:04,420
And don't curse too much.
It's not good for your mental health.

617
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:08,070
Geez!

618
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,490
<i>The phone has been turned off...</i>

Yang Jung Do.

620
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:21,890
Come out.

621
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:41,540
<i>After the IMF in 1997,
Korean minds had been changed.</i>

622
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:46,360
<i>All money.
They'll do anything for money.</i>

623
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,360
<i>Like dogs.</i>

624
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:54,260
<i>They say money, their religion. Money,

I'm leaving.

628
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,120
<i>Since the world spins this way</i>

629
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,200
<i>a person like me can get discharged.</i>

630
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,920
<i>My teenage years were filled with bravado</i>

631

<i>And now, in my 30's,

633
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:34,280
<i>Conning people is very simple.</i>

634

<i>Once, I thought,
why would people fall for this?</i>

635
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,490
<i>Surprisingly, the answer is very simple.</i>

636
