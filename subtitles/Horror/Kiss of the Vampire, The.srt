{4605}{4679}So you want me to tell|you the story of my life.
{4682}{4766}Like I said, that's what I do.|I interview people.
{4769}{4808}I'm a collector of lives.
{4811}{4856}FM radio, KFRC.
{4859}{4923}You'll need a lot of tape|for my story.
{4926}{5008}No problem.|I got a bag full of tape.
{5022}{5087}You followed me here,|didn't you?
{5090}{5148}Yeah, I suppose I did.
{5151}{5217}You seemed very interesting.
{5228}{5279}This is where you live?
{5282}{5308}No.
{5311}{5369}It's just a room.
{5416}{5490}What do you say|we get started?
{5547}{5586}What do you do?
{5589}{5647}I'm a vampire.
{5695}{5763}I haven't heard that before.
{5766}{5826}You mean this literally,|I take it?
{5829}{5882}Absolutely.
{5885}{5947}I was waiting for you|in that alley.
{5950}{6022}Watching you watching me.
{6027}{6093}And then you began to speak.
{6100}{6155}What a lucky break for me.
{6158}{6224}Perhaps lucky for both of us.
{6304}{6360}You said you were...
{6363}{6412}...waiting for me.
{6415}{6497}What were you going to do?|Kill me, drink my blood?
{6500}{6546}Yes.
{6552}{6624}But you needn't be|concerned now.
{6667}{6766}You really believe this, don't you,|that you're a vampire?
{6769}{6818}We can't begin this way.
{6821}{6881}Let me turn on the light.
{6884}{6984}- I thought vampires didn't like light.|- We love it.
{7001}{7075}I only wanted to prepare you.
{7115}{7140}Christ!
{7143}{7200}Don't be frightened.
{7203}{7258}I want this opportunity.
{7261}{7308}How the hell did you do that?
{7311}{7363}The same as you do.
{7366}{7427}A series of simple gestures.
{7430}{7508}Only I moved too fast|for you to see.
{7524}{7565}I'm flesh and blood...
{7568}{7617}...but not human.
{7620}{7716}I haven't been human|for 200 years.
{7745}{7793}Please...
{7987}{8045}How can I put you at ease?
{8048}{8113}Shall we begin like|"David Copperfield"?
{8116}{8145}"I am born..."
{8148}{8199}"...I grew up."
{8227}{8351}Or shall we begin when I was|born to darkness, as I call it.
{8373}{8459}That's where we should start,|don't you think?
{8494}{8562}You're not lying, are you?
{8571}{8631}Why should I lie?
{8663}{8740}1791 was the year it happened.
{8848}{8893}I was 24.
{8896}{8958}Younger than you are now.
{8961}{9044}But times were different then.|I was a man at that age.
{9047}{9165}The master of a large plantation,|just south of New Orleans.
{9230}{9294}I had lost my wife|in childbirth.
{9297}{9395}She and the infant had been|buried less than half a year.
{9405}{9479}I would've been happy|to join them.
{9522}{9592}I couldn't bear the pain|of their loss.
{9595}{9673}I longed to be released from it.
{9975}{10026}I wanted to lose it all:
{10029}{10080}my wealth...
{10083}{10130}...my estate...
{10133}{10191}...my sanity.
{10379}{10435}How many aces are in a deck?
{10438}{10502}Are you calling me a cheat?
{10559}{10649}No, I'm calling you|a piece of stinking offal!
{10773}{10858}You lack the courage|of your convictions. Do it!
{10861}{10937}Most of all,|I longed for death.
{10940}{10993}I know that now.
{10996}{11056}I invited it.
{11061}{11143}A release|from the pain of living.
{11658}{11740}My invitation|was open to anyone.
{11743}{11815}To the whore at my side.
{11822}{11894}To the pimp that followed.
{11931}{12023}But it was a vampire|that accepted.
{12665}{12733}Give me your money|or you die!
{13582}{13632}Do you still want death?
{13635}{13688}Or have you|tasted it enough?
{13691}{13739}Enough.
{13960}{14056}He left me there, on the banks|of the Mississippi...
{14066}{14160}...somewhere between|life and death.
{14604}{14688}Who are you?|What're you doing in my house?
{14693}{14777}I've come to answer|your prayers.
{14821}{14899}Life has no meaning anymore...|does it?
{14981}{15036}The wine has no taste.
{15039}{15088}The food sickens you.
{15091}{15183}There seems no reason for any of it...|does there?
{15294}{15360}What if I could|give it back to you?
{15363}{15402}Pluck out the pain...
{15405}{15469}...and give you another life?
{15472}{15548}One you could never imagine.
{15557}{15627}And it would be...|for all time.
{15669}{15703}And sickness...
{15706}{15745}...and death...
{15748}{15824}...could never touch you again.
{15848}{15903}Don't be afraid.
{15906}{15969}I'm going to give you|the choice...
{15972}{16003}...I...
{16006}{16062}...never had.
{16278}{16346}That morning,|I was not yet a vampire...
{16349}{16433}...and I saw my last sunrise.
{16436}{16507}I remember it completely...
{16510}{16611}...and yet I can't recall|any sunrise before it.
{16652}{16745}I watched the whole magnificence|of the dawn for the last time...
{16748}{16812}...as if it were the first.
{16894}{16960}And then I said farewell|to sunlight...
{16963}{17013}...and set out to become...
{17016}{17061}...what I became.
{17557}{17645}Have you said your good-byes|to the light?
{18187}{18227}I've drained you...
{18230}{18301}...to the point of death.
{18312}{18365}If I leave you here...
{18368}{18420}...you'll die.
{18430}{18472}Or...
{18480}{18576}...you can be young always,|my friend...
{18589}{18653}...as we are now.
{18672}{18732}But you must tell me...
{18735}{18769}...will you come...
{18772}{18819}...or no?
{18897}{18948}Yes.
{19064}{19116}Yes.
{20681}{20733}Your body's dying.
{20736}{20791}Pay no attention.
{20794}{20859}It happens to us all.
{21595}{21622}Now look...
{21625}{21701}...with your vampire eyes.
{22146}{22201}What did you see?
{22205}{22276}No words can describe it.
{22300}{22363}Might as well ask Heaven|what it sees.
{22366}{22427}No human can know.
{22447}{22523}The statue seemed to move,|but didn't.
{22526}{22617}The world had changed,|yet stayed the same.
{22634}{22749}I was a newborn vampire,|weeping at the beauty of the night.
{22876}{22952}Perhaps you'd like|another cigarette?
{22967}{23036}I would.|It's not bothering you, is it?
{23039}{23153}I don't assume it would.|It's not like you'll die from cancer.
{23156}{23215}I don't think so.
{23243}{23307}- What about crucifixes?|- Crucifixes?
{23310}{23360}Can you look at them?
{23363}{23453}Actually, I'm quite fond of|looking at crucifixes.
{23459}{23511}And the stake|through the heart?
{23514}{23544}Nonsense.
{23547}{23596}And coffins?
{23601}{23636}Coffins.
{23639}{23724}Coffins, unfortunately,|are a necessity.
{23772}{23825}Don't worry.
{23831}{23870}Soon...
{23873}{23976}...you'll be sleeping as|soundly as you've ever slept.
{24001}{24066}And when you awake...
{24073}{24140}...I'll be waiting for you...
{24143}{24224}...and so will all the world.
{24423}{24523}Blood, I was to find,|was a necessity as well.
{24531}{24644}I awoke the next evening with|a hunger I had never felt.
{24670}{24724}Once you taste this...
{24727}{24816}...you'll never go to|another tavern again.
{24819}{24879}You think so?
{24886}{24971}But what if I'd rather|taste your lips?
{24974}{25057}My lips are even sweeter still.
{25425}{25480}My friend...
{25483}{25547}...should taste those lips.
{25550}{25580}Is his...
{25583}{25614}...kiss...
{25617}{25646}...as deep...
{25649}{25705}...as yours?
{25717}{25781}Deeper, ma chérie.
{26596}{26668}I will not take her life.
{26679}{26740}I've done it for you.
{26793}{26849}She's dead...
{26855}{26931}...as a doornail, my friend.
{27093}{27193}It's so easy, you almost feel sorry for them.
{27343}{27384}You'll get used to killing.
{27387}{27466}Just forget about that mortal coil.
{27469}{27557}You'll become accustomed to it,|all too quickly.
{27738}{27774}Are you not hungry?
{27777}{27820}Au contraire, ma chérie.
{27823}{27891}He could eat the whole colony.
{28344}{28375}I will finish it.
{28378}{28428}Now leave us.
{28607}{28665}Can't you pretend, you fool?
{28668}{28723}Don't give the game away.
{28726}{28802}We're lucky to have such a home.
{29028}{29108}Pretend to drink, at least.
{29212}{29296}Such fine crystal|shouldn't go to waste.
{29808}{29843}I know.
{29846}{29901}It gets cold so quickly.
{29904}{29943}We can live like this?
{29946}{29985}On animal blood?
{29988}{30077}I wouldn't call it living.|Call it surviving.
{30080}{30166}Useful trick if you're|on a ship for a month.
{30215}{30289}There's nothing in the world|now that doesn't hold some...
{30292}{30344}Fascination.
{30353}{30399}Yes.
{30414}{30487}- I'm bored with this prattle.|- We can live without killing.
{30490}{30525}It's possible.
{30528}{30565}Anything is possible.
{30568}{30625}But just try it for a week.
{30628}{30756}Come into New Orleans and let|me show you some real sport.
{30995}{31095}Lestat killed two,|sometimes three a night.
{31099}{31144}A fresh young girl...
{31147}{31234}...was his favorite for|the first of the evening.
{31237}{31341}For seconds, he preferred a gilded,|beautiful youth.
{31364}{31463}But the snob in him|loved to hunt in society.
{31466}{31562}The blood of the aristocrat|thrilled him best of all.
{31573}{31645}The trick is|not to think about it.
{31648}{31682}You see that one?
{31685}{31726}Widow St. Clair.
{31729}{31839}She had that gorgeous young fop|murder her husband.
{31842}{31895}How do you know?
{31911}{31969}Read her thoughts.
{32007}{32069}Read her thoughts.
{32196}{32248}I can't.
{32273}{32346}The "dark gift"|is different for each of us.
{32349}{32469}But one thing is true of everyone.|We grow stronger as we go along.
{32476}{32544}Just take my word for it.
{32553}{32619}She blamed a slave|for his murder.
{32622}{32690}Imagine what they did to him.
{32693}{32787}Evil-doers are easier,|and they taste better.
{33571}{33627}Where are we going?
{33798}{33846}Nowhere.
{33854}{33950}Now, young man,|you really amaze me!
{34002}{34100}I'm old enough|to be your grandmother.
{34438}{34508}Oh, yes, that's the melody.
{34511}{34571}I remember it.
{34853}{34902}Murderer!
{34905}{34938}My little papillons!
{34941}{35021}My butterflies, he killed them!
{35078}{35136}You...|whining coward of a vampire...
{35139}{35246}...who prowls killing rats and poodles!|You could've finished us!
{35249}{35284}You've condemned me to Hell!
{35287}{35346}I don't know any Hell.
{35452}{35501}That's more like it!
{35504}{35538}Anger! Fury!
{35541}{35623}That's why I chose you!
{35735}{35817}But you can't kill me, Louis.
{35971}{36014}Feed...
{36017}{36070}...on what you will.
{36073}{36120}Rats, chickens...
{36123}{36171}...poodles.
{36182}{36229}I'll leave you to it...
{36232}{36289}...and watch you come around.
{36292}{36327}Remember:
{36330}{36383}Life without me...
{36386}{36429}...would be even more...
{36432}{36484}...unbearable.
{37942}{38010}Consider yourself lucky.
{38019}{38115}In Paris, a vampire must be|clever for many reasons.
{38123}{38154}Paris?
{38157}{38245}Here all one needs|is a pair of fangs.
{38250}{38295}You came from Paris?
{38298}{38374}As did the one who made me.
{38401}{38501}Tell me about him.|You must've learned something from him.
{38540}{38616}I learned absolutely nothing.
{38626}{38706}I wasn't given a choice, remember?
{38709}{38773}You must know something|about the meaning of it all.
{38776}{38846}Why? Why should I know|these things?
{38849}{38888}Do you know them?
{38891}{38921}That noise...
{38924}{38977}...it's driving me mad!
{38980}{39063}We've been here for weeks|with nothing but that noise!
{39066}{39107}They know about us.
{39110}{39223}They watch us dine on empty plates|and drink from empty glasses.
{39226}{39257}Come...
{39260}{39311}...to New Orleans then.
{39314}{39405}The Paris Opera's in town.|We can try some French...
{39408}{39455}...cuisine.
{39458}{39554}Forgive me if I have a|lingering respect for life.
{39604}{39682}You'll soon run out|of chickens, Louis.
{40494}{40539}Monsieur Louis?
{40542}{40606}You don't want any supper?
{40632}{40682}No, ma chérie.
{40688}{40760}We're worried about you, Master.
{40797}{40879}When is it that you go|riding in the field?
{40895}{40988}And how long since you've|been to the slave quarter?
{41045}{41113}Everywhere there is death.
{41160}{41221}Are you still our master at all?
{41224}{41290}That will be all, Yvette.
{41293}{41375}I will not go|unless you listen to me.
{41402}{41484}You must send away|this friend of yours.
{41493}{41575}The slaves are all|frightened of him...
{41598}{41670}...and they are|frightened of you.
{41787}{41859}I'm frightened of myself.
{43049}{43100}Hear me now!
{43103}{43155}This place is cursed!
{43158}{43196}Damned!
{43199}{43281}And, yes,|your master is the Devil!
{43289}{43363}Get out while you can!|You're all free!
{43366}{43420}Do you hear me?
{43429}{43457}Run!
{43460}{43482}Run!
{43485}{43555}Save yourselves!
{44751}{44800}Perfect! Perfect!
{44803}{44891}Just burn the place!|Burn everything we own!
{44894}{44958}Have us living in a field,|like cattle!
{44961}{45015}You thought|you could have it all.
{45018}{45074}Shut up, Louis!
{45089}{45139}Come on!
{45647}{45703}Where are we?
{45706}{45774}Where do you think,|my idiot friend?
{45777}{45857}We're in a nice,|filthy cemetery.
{45860}{45899}Are you happy?
{45902}{45978}Is this fitting?|Proper enough?
{45981}{46027}We belong in Hell.
{46030}{46074}What if there is no Hell?
{46077}{46172}Or they don't want us there?|Ever think of that?
{46198}{46267}But there was a Hell.
{46270}{46361}And no matter where we moved to,|I was in it.
{46382}{46478}We rented rooms on the|waterfront of New Orleans.
{46498}{46568}Your skin is icy.
{47073}{47146}Your friend has|no head for wine.
{47233}{47283}Don't worry.
{47286}{47383}I can warm that cold skin|of yours better than she can.
{47386}{47439}Do you think so?
{47457}{47491}Why...
{47494}{47554}...you're warm now!
{47566}{47622}But the price is high.
{47625}{47705}Your pretty friend,|I exhausted her.
{47782}{47833}Soft.
{47862}{47922}So soft.
{47946}{48037}I can see you lying|on a bed of satin.
{48045}{48117}Such things you say.
{48137}{48208}Do you know|what manner of bed?
{48863}{48931}Should we put out the light?
{49053}{49127}And then put out the light.
{49475}{49546}But once I've put out|thy light...
{49572}{49622}...I cannot...
{49634}{49715}...give it vital breath again.
{49743}{49811}Its needs must wither.
{50098}{50137}For you, Louis.
{50140}{50204}You can pretend it's wine.
{50439}{50469}She's not dead!
{50472}{50570}You're in love with your mortal nature.|You resist what can bring you peace.
{50573}{50607}You call this peace?
{50610}{50708}We're predators, whose all-seeing|eyes give them detachment!
{50711}{50775}- The girl, Lestat!|- Take her! End that hunger!
{50778}{50822}No!
{50973}{51030}Now, my child.
{51060}{51137}You're tired,|you want to sleep!
{51358}{51399}It's a coffin!
{51402}{51462}A coffin! Let me out!
{51465}{51503}I'm not dead!
{51506}{51622}It's your coffin, enjoy it. Most of us|never get to know what it feels like.
{51625}{51661}Why do you do this?
{51664}{51784}I like to do it. I enjoy it.|Take your aesthete's taste to purer things.
{51787}{51859}Kill them swiftly if you will,|but do it!
{51862}{51948}For do not doubt|you are a killer, Louis!
{52111}{52195}- What's that?|- It's a coffin.
{52203}{52272}So it is. You must be dead.
{52294}{52343}I'm not dead, am I?
{52346}{52379}You're not dead.
{52382}{52414}Not yet.
{52417}{52460}Finish this now!
{52463}{52491}You finish it!
{52494}{52541}Save me from him!
{52544}{52588}Save me!
{52624}{52668}You'll let me go?
{52671}{52731}I can't die like this!
{52734}{52764}I need a priest.
{52767}{52838}My friend is a priest.|He'll hear your sins before you die.
{52841}{52894}Unless...|I make her one of us.
{52897}{52922}No!
{52925}{53038}Then take her, Louis,|end her suffering!|End yours!
{53050}{53094}No!
{53555}{53594}Now...
{53597}{53657}...are you happy?
{53738}{53791}My God!
{53821}{53864}To think you...
{53867}{53943}...are all I have to learn from.
{54013}{54082}In the Old World...
{54085}{54169}...they called it the|"dark gift."
{54219}{54291}And I gave it to you.
{54822}{54903}Don't go that way, Monsieur.|It's the plague.
{54906}{55003}- Go back the way you came!|- The way I came...
{55375}{55417}Mama.
{56000}{56054}Please help us.
{56057}{56134}Papa left us|and didn't come back.
{56313}{56396}Please, wake Mama, Monsieur.
{57054}{57118}My philosopher.|My martyr.
{57121}{57198}"Never take a human life."
{57224}{57298}This calls for a celebration.
{57522}{57609}There's still life|in the old lady yet.
{57677}{57714}Come back!
{57717}{57789}You are what you are!
{57821}{57889}Merciful death.
{57892}{57977}How you love|your precious guilt.
{58198}{58249}Her blood coursed in my veins...
{58252}{58300}...sweeter than life itself.
{58303}{58365}And, as it did, Lestat's words|made sense to me.
{58368}{58415}I knew peace|only when I killed.
{58418}{58551}When I heard her heart in that terrible|rhythm, I knew what peace could be.
{59386}{59502}All I need to find you, Louis,|is follow the corpses of rats.
{59694}{59759}Pain is terrible for you.
{59773}{59882}You feel it like no other creature,|because you're a vampire.
{59908}{59964}You don't want it to go on.
{59967}{60015}No.
{60074}{60168}Then do what it is|in your nature to do...
{60171}{60278}...and you will feel as you felt|with that child in your arms.
{60312}{60379}Evil is a point of view.
{60382}{60454}God kills indiscriminately...
{60467}{60531}...and so shall we.
{60537}{60657}For no creatures under God are as we are.|None so like Him...
{60660}{60713}...as ourselves.
{60754}{60827}I have a gift for you.
{60844}{60896}Come.
{60976}{61020}Please.
{61333}{61409}- She's here.|- What are you saying?
{61429}{61476}You need...
{61479}{61516}...company...
{61519}{61592}...more congenial than mine.
{61701}{61769}Remember how you wanted her?
{61777}{61836}The taste of her?
{61864}{61935}I thought I'd killed her.
{61992}{62045}Don't worry.
{62072}{62136}Your conscience is clear.
{62443}{62492}Claudia.
{62648}{62703}Listen to me.
{62706}{62762}You're ill, my precious.
{62765}{62880}And I'm going to give you|what you need to get well.
{63174}{63220}No.
{63223}{63287}You want her to die then?
{63648}{63709}That's it. Yes.
{64046}{64094}Stop!
{64136}{64180}Stop!
{64183}{64231}Enough!
{65201}{65240}I want some more.
{65243}{65323}Of course you want more.
{66048}{66112}Gently, chérie.
{66119}{66187}They're so innocent.
{66202}{66274}They must not be made|to suffer.
{66288}{66337}Good.
{66376}{66407}Yes.
{66410}{66448}All right, now.
{66451}{66499}Stop.
{66544}{66601}That's enough, chérie.
{66604}{66685}You must stop|before the heart stops.
{66700}{66731}I want more.
{66734}{66770}I know.
{66773}{66829}But it's best in the beginning...
{66832}{66919}...lest the Death|takes you down with it.
{66927}{66986}You've done very well.|Look at you.
{66989}{67065}Not a drop spilt.|Very good.
{67115}{67171}Where is Mama?
{67239}{67291}Mama's gone...
{67294}{67394}...to Heaven, chérie, like|that sweet lady... right there.
{67410}{67463}They all go to Heaven.
{67466}{67522}All but us.
{67532}{67592}Do you want to|frighten our daughter?
{67595}{67634}I'm not your daughter.
{67637}{67688}Oh, yes, you are.
{67691}{67754}You're my and|Louis' daughter now.
{67757}{67842}You see,|Louis was going to leave us.
{67853}{67917}He was going to go away.
{67923}{67979}But now he's not.
{67986}{68030}Now he's going to stay...
{68033}{68097}...and make you happy.
{68137}{68184}Louis.
{68312}{68357}You fiend.
{68360}{68424}One happy family.
{68654}{68706}He did it to make you|stay with him?
{68709}{68746}Perhaps.
{68749}{68870}He knew me. He knew I would love|her more than the waking world.
{68899}{68959}But there was more to it.
{68962}{69067}He lavished affection on her,|there is no doubt about that.
{69079}{69200}Perhaps, in the end,|he did it because he was lonely too.
{69216}{69260}- I need more light.|- She needs more light.
{69263}{69330}- I'll go blind without another lamp.|- She'll go blind.
{69333}{69394}Or let me fit this child|during the day.
{69397}{69508}Well, I am afraid, madame,|that my days are sacrosanct.
{69526}{69582}A little child, she was.
{69585}{69635}But also a fierce killer...
{69638}{69775}...now capable of the ruthless pursuit|of blood with all a child's demanding.
{69801}{69864}Let me kiss it better.
{70194}{70232}Now...
{70235}{70328}...who will we get to finish|your dress? Be practical!
{70331}{70406}Remember, never in our home!
{70410}{70481}She slept in my coffin|at first...
{70484}{70558}...curling her little fingers|around my hair...
{70561}{70647}...till the day when she|wanted her own coffin.
{70819}{70883}But still,|whenever she awoke...
{70886}{70953}...she would crawl into mine.
{71211}{71308}They died fast in those days, before,|she learned to play with them...
{71311}{71413}...to delay the moment till|she had taken what she wanted.
{71741}{71798}Why are you crying, child?
{71801}{71848}Are you lost, my love?
{71851}{71905}Mama!
{71916}{71965}Hush, now, don't cry.
{71968}{72028}We'll find her.
{72181}{72291}Mind the thumb, girl. Mind the thumb.|That little digit.
{72631}{72713}They're expensive, my dear.
{72729}{72833}Maybe too expensive for|a young girl like you.
{73161}{73231}Claudia!|What have we told you!
{73234}{73296}Never in the house.
{73334}{73390}Give me some room.
{73405}{73450}To me, she was a child.
{73453}{73519}But to Lestat, a pupil...
{73522}{73617}...an infant prodigy with|a lust for killing like his own.
{73620}{73714}Together, they finished off|whole families.
{73872}{73919}Wonderful, wonderful.
{73922}{74008}Now try something|on a more somber note.
{74333}{74409}Time can pass quickly for|mortals when they're happy.
{74412}{74466}With us, it was the same.
{74469}{74553}The years flew by like minutes.|The city grew.
{74556}{74610}Sailboats gave way|to steamships...
{74613}{74727}...disgorging an endless menu|of magnificent strangers.
{74734}{74789}A new world had sprung up around us.
{74792}{74868}And we were all Americans now.
{75055}{75110}This filthy modern tide!
{75113}{75225}What I wouldn't give for a drop|of old-fashioned Creole blood!
{75228}{75289}Yankees are not|to your taste?
{75292}{75396}Their Democratic flavor|doesn't suit my palate, Louis.
{75845}{75913}Now that is pure Creole.
{75979}{76063}Trust Claudia|to have found her.
{76113}{76155}What?
{76158}{76203}Don't you want her?
{76206}{76269}I want to be her.
{76314}{76343}Can I?
{76346}{76402}Be like her one day?
{76492}{76582}More melancholy nonsense.|You grow more like Louis daily!
{76585}{76649}Soon you'll be eating rats.
{76669}{76759}Rats?|When did you eat rats, Louis?
{76764}{76814}It was a long, long time ago.
{76817}{76875}Before you were born.
{76889}{76954}And I don't recommend them.
{77005}{77135}Thirty years had passed, yet her body|remained that of an eternal child.
{77142}{77256}Her eyes alone told the story of her age,|staring from under her curls...
{77259}{77294}...with a questioning...
{77297}{77377}...that would one day|need an answer.
{77607}{77642}Another doll.
{77645}{77717}I have dozens,|you realize.
{77722}{77794}I thought you could use one more.
{77797}{77867}Why always on this night?
{77878}{77917}What do you mean?
{77920}{78016}You always give me a doll on|the same night of the year.
{78043}{78087}I didn't realize.
{78090}{78153}Is this my birthday?
{78246}{78305}You dress me like a doll.
{78308}{78355}You make my hair like a doll.
{78358}{78395}Why?
{78398}{78489}Some of these, Claudia,|are so old...
{78492}{78542}...tattered.
{78553}{78642}- You should throw them away.|- I will, then!
{78957}{78997}What have you done?
{79000}{79052}What you told me to do!
{79055}{79129}- You leave a corpse here to rot?|- I wanted her!
{79132}{79191}- I wanted to be her!|- She's mad!
{79194}{79278}She pollutes the very house|we live in!
{79286}{79376}Do you want me to be|a doll forever?
{79388}{79419}Don't!
{79422}{79477}Why not?|Can't I change...
{79480}{79539}...like everyone else?
{80177}{80236}Which one of you did it?
{80239}{80290}Which one of you did it?
{80293}{80361}Which one of you|made me the way I am?
{80364}{80402}What you are?
{80405}{80491}A vampire gone insane,|that pollutes its own bed!
{80494}{80540}And if I cut my hair again?
{80543}{80591}It will grow back again.
{80594}{80635}But it wasn't always so!
{80638}{80715}I had a mother once.|And Louis, he had a wife.
{80718}{80766}He was mortal, same as she.
{80769}{80818}And so was I!
{80821}{80866}You made us what we are!
{80869}{80903}Stop her.
{80906}{80964}Did you do it to me?
{81121}{81158}How did you do it?
{81161}{81229}And why should I tell you?
{81232}{81294}It's in my power.
{81297}{81342}Why yours alone?
{81345}{81394}Tell me how it was done!
{81397}{81429}Be glad...
{81432}{81502}...I made you what you are.
{81519}{81569}You'd be dead now|if I hadn't.
{81572}{81650}Like that damned corpse!|Now get rid of it!
{81653}{81717}You get rid of it.
{81979}{82019}Louis, why?
{82022}{82090}You've got to tell me.
{82233}{82295}You see the old woman?
{82304}{82372}That will never happen to you.
{82379}{82438}You will never grow old.
{82441}{82503}And you will never die.
{82525}{82631}And it means something else too,|doesn't it?
{82704}{82782}I shall never, ever grow up.
{82890}{82944}I hate him.
{82984}{83087}Tell me how it came to be|that I am this...
{83090}{83139}...thing.
{83271}{83363}For thirty years|I'd avoided that place.
{83384}{83448}Yet I found my way|back there...
{83451}{83538}...with hardly|an upward glance.
{83912}{83944}You...
{83947}{83996}...fed on me?
{83999}{84047}Yes.
{84074}{84140}And he found me with you.
{84184}{84265}Then he cut his wrist|and fed you from him...
{84268}{84324}...and you were a vampire then...
{84327}{84407}...and have been|every night thereafter.
{84473}{84531}You both did it.
{84534}{84595}I took your life.
{84640}{84706}He gave you another one.
{84731}{84778}And here it is.
{84781}{84843}I hate you both.
{85140}{85204}I walked all night.
{85217}{85277}I walked as I walked|years before...
{85280}{85380}...when my mind swam with guilt|at the thought of killing.
{85395}{85517}I thought of all the things|I'd done and couldn't undo.
{85528}{85606}And I longed for|one second's peace.
{85824}{85900}Locked together in hatred.
{86001}{86073}But I can't hate you, Louis.
{86216}{86282}Louis, my love.
{86311}{86380}I was mortal till you...
{86399}{86476}...gave me your immortal kiss.
{86500}{86596}You became my mother|and my father.
{86619}{86695}And so I'm yours forever.
{86731}{86813}But now it's time|to end it, Louis.
{86833}{86909}Now it's time to leave him.
{86987}{87056}He will never let us go.
{87334}{87382}Really?
{87662}{87738}What is it now? You irritate me.|Your very presence...
{87741}{87769}...irritates me!
{87772}{87810}Does it?
{87813}{87897}I found someone who'll be a|vampire better than you both!
{87900}{87967}Is that supposed to|frighten me?
{87970}{88065}You're spoiled,|because you're an only child.
{88068}{88123}You need a brother.
{88126}{88172}Or I do.
{88175}{88235}I'm weary of you both.
{88238}{88311}I suppose we could people|the world with vampires...
{88314}{88373}...the three of us.
{88376}{88415}Oh, not you...
{88418}{88473}...my little Claudia.
{88476}{88533}You're a liar.
{88538}{88607}But you upset my plans.
{88617}{88682}What plans?
{88685}{88745}I came to make peace|with you.
{88748}{88828}Even though you're|the father of lies...
{88831}{88909}...I want things to be|as they were.
{88921}{88983}Stop pestering me then.
{89055}{89129}I must do more than that.
{89136}{89205}I've brought|a present for you.
{89248}{89287}Then I hope it's...
{89290}{89341}...a beautiful woman...
{89344}{89438}...with endowments|you'll never possess.
{89507}{89573}Why do you say such things?
{89778}{89842}You haven't fed enough.
{89845}{89911}I can tell by your color.
{90056}{90112}Come and see.
{90511}{90560}Don't be angry with me.
{90563}{90647}When I saw them,|I knew they were for you.
{90666}{90713}Drunk...
{90716}{90798}...on brandywine.|A thimbleful.
{91001}{91045}You certainly have...
{91048}{91104}...outdone yourself.
{91131}{91213}I promise|I'll get rid of the bodies.
{91539}{91604}We forgive each other then?
{91624}{91673}Yes.
{92042}{92093}Absinthe?
{92142}{92196}You've given them absinthe?
{92199}{92231}No.
{92234}{92281}Laudanum.
{92299}{92329}Laudanum.
{92332}{92368}Yes.
{92371}{92439}It killed them, unfortunately.
{92442}{92512}But it keeps the blood warm.
{92601}{92657}You let me drink...
{92687}{92738}...dead blood?
{92741}{92786}You let me...
{92789}{92838}...drink...
{92845}{92900}One lesson you taught me...
{92903}{92970}...never drink from the dead.
{93025}{93077}Put me in my coffin.
{93080}{93117}Put me in my coffin.
{93120}{93186}I'll put you in your coffin!
{93295}{93339}My God!
{93758}{93814}Lift me up!
{94165}{94229}Good night, sweet prince.
{94255}{94363}May flights of devils wing|you to your rest.
{94389}{94433}Should we burn him?
{94436}{94471}Bury him?
{94474}{94538}What would he have liked?
{94620}{94668}The swamp?
{95235}{95303}He belongs with those reptiles.
{95343}{95411}He deserved to die.
{95420}{95510}Then perhaps so do we,|every night of our lives.
{95579}{95643}He was my maker.
{95650}{95693}He gave me this life...
{95696}{95754}...whatever it is.
{95812}{95872}It shouldn't have been|this way.
{95875}{95928}I did it for us.
{95948}{96014}So we could be free.
{96154}{96206}You missed him?
{96230}{96270}He was all I knew.
{96273}{96334}It's as simple as that.
{96342}{96430}We were like two orphans|learning to live again.
{96469}{96537}We booked a passage|to Europe.
{96542}{96608}Over the weeks,|while waiting for the boat...
{96611}{96702}...she studied the myths|and legends of the Old World...
{96705}{96805}...obsessed with the search|of what she called "our kind."
{97151}{97213}Look who we forgot.
{97305}{97366}Let's set them free.
{97380}{97429}- Yes.|- Yes.
{97545}{97605}It's the carriage.
{98751}{98812}Listen, Louis...
{98838}{98879}...there's life...
{98882}{98954}...in these old hands still.
{99007}{99081}Not quite furioso.
{99133}{99185}Moderato...
{99197}{99248}...cantabile, perhaps.
{99251}{99298}How could it be?
{99301}{99363}Ask the alligator.
{99366}{99430}His blood helped.
{99470}{99580}Then, on a diet of|the blood of snakes...
{99583}{99631}...toads...
{99666}{99730}...and all the putrid life...
{99733}{99795}...of the Mississippi...
{99810}{99863}...slowly...
{99875}{99939}...Lestat became something...
{99942}{100006}...like himself again.
{100111}{100160}You've been...
{100163}{100210}...a very...
{100213}{100245}...very...
{100248}{100309}...naughty little girl.
{101848}{101920}The ship is sailing without us!
{102392}{102458}Though the fire|seemed to spread...
{102461}{102560}...I stood on that deck,|fearful, he would come out again...
{102563}{102655}...from the river like some monster,|to destroy us.
{102667}{102729}And all the while I thought...
{102732}{102762}"Lestat..."
{102765}{102835}"...we deserve your vengeance."
{102840}{102902}"You gave me the 'dark gift'..."
{102905}{103026}"...and I delivered you into the|hands of Death for the second time."
{103434}{103523}Though the ship was|blessedly free of rats...
{103526}{103638}...a strange plague nonetheless|struck its passengers.
{103657}{103737}Claudia and I alone|seemed immune.
{103759}{103812}We kept to ourselves...
{103815}{103897}...pondering the mystery|of each other.
{103949}{103992}We reached the Mediterranean.
{103995}{104100}I wanted those waters to be blue...|but they were black...
{104103}{104142}...night-time waters.
{104145}{104202}And how I suffered then...
{104205}{104319}...straining to recall the color|that in my youth I took for granted.
{104462}{104519}We searched|village after village...
{104522}{104559}...ruin after ruin...
{104562}{104613}...country after country.
{104616}{104686}And always we found nothing.
{104729}{104833}I began to believe|we were the only ones.
{104852}{104928}There was a strange|comfort in that thought.
{104931}{105041}For what could the damned really|have to say to the damned?
{105071}{105105}You found nothing?
{105108}{105153}Peasant rumors...
{105156}{105210}...superstitions about garlic...
{105213}{105245}...crosses...
{105248}{105320}...the old stake in the heart.
{105329}{105379}But one of our kind?
{105382}{105434}Not a whisper.
{105461}{105566}There are no vampires in Transylvania?|No Count Dracula?
{105569}{105610}Fictions, my friend.
{105613}{105690}The vulgar fictions|of a demented Irishman.
{105711}{105737}Paris...
{105740}{105800}...September, 1870.
{105809}{105875}The city I'd always|dreamed of.
{105878}{105996}I was Creole, after all,|and Paris was the mother of New Orleans.
{105999}{106101}A universe whole|and entire unto herself.
{106956}{107007}We were alive again.
{107010}{107053}Just the two of us.
{107056}{107180}And so euphoric was I|that I yielded to her every desire.
{107480}{107518}So it was...
{107521}{107598}...when I'd given up the|search for vampires...
{107601}{107677}...that a vampire found me.
{109901}{109955}Buffoon!
{109976}{110026}Santiago!
{110203}{110333}I've searched the world for an|immortal and this is what I find!
{110720}{110798}Bring the petite|beauty with you.
{110814}{110853}No one will harm you.
{110856}{110910}I won't allow it.
{110960}{110997}And...
{111000}{111062}...remember my name:
{111092}{111142}Armand.
{111325}{111372}Remember what I told you.
{111375}{111489}They have different powers.|They'll read your thoughts.
{111792}{111864}He's the one,|that's the vampire.
{111886}{111925}Two lovers...
{111928}{112022}...wandering down|their violet way...
{112026}{112111}...whose passionate embraces,|each to each...
{112114}{112216}...permit no meditations|on decay...
{112251}{112298}...until they find themselves...
{112301}{112359}...within my reach!
{112504}{112596}Vampires who pretend to be humans|pretending to be vampires.
{112599}{112640}How avant-garde.
{112643}{112745}The monk whose soul with|Heaven doth commune...
{112752}{112792}...and spends his days...
{112795}{112875}...in pious contemplation...
{112919}{113031}...finds he will meet|his Maker all too soon.
{113042}{113142}For all his prayers|gets no remuneration.
{113252}{113308}The lesson endeth here...
{113311}{113372}...and it is this:
{113375}{113485}Each one of you,|my clammy hands must touch.
{113509}{113613}Each one must bend his|forehead to my kiss.
{113657}{113702}But, hark!
{113705}{113779}Methinks a mortal|doth approach!
{113842}{113906}What have we here?
{113909}{113979}What beauty by my side?
{113993}{114079}A rose in bloom,|a shrinking violet?
{114105}{114183}Perhaps she has a mind|to be my bride.
{114186}{114268}Perhaps my lesson|has not ended yet!
{114310}{114354}I don't want to die!
{114357}{114423}But Death we are|and have always been.
{114426}{114465}Someone help me!
{114468}{114526}Please!
{114743}{114815}- What have I done?|- We all die!
{114818}{114845}But I'm young!
{114848}{114974}Death is no respecter of age!|It can come any time, any place.
{115298}{115374}Just as this flesh|is pink now...
{115377}{115456}...so it will turn gray|and wrinkle with age.
{115459}{115504}Let me live!|I don't care!
{115507}{115577}Then why should you care|if you die now?
{115580}{115685}And suppose Death had a heart|to love and to release you?
{115688}{115743}To whom would he turn|his passion?
{115746}{115818}Would you choose a person|from the crowd there?
{115821}{115866}A person to suffer as you do?
{115869}{115917}Monsieur Vampire, take me!
{115920}{115977}I adore you!
{115980}{116058}You wait your turn!
{116063}{116119}Well...
{116122}{116236}Do you know what it means|to be loved by Death?
{116259}{116343}To become our bride?
{117824}{117880}No pain.
{117976}{118032}No pain.
{118332}{118386}Monstrous.
{119607}{119660}We live beneath.
{119663}{119721}Let me show you.
{119853}{119911}Monstrous.
{119915}{119969}Yes.
{119976}{120042}But very beautiful.
{120556}{120624}Welcome to my home.
{120981}{121035}Try him.
{121584}{121646}Two vampires...
{121652}{121718}...from the New World...
{121721}{121798}...come to guide us|into the new era...
{121801}{121873}...as all we love slowly rots...
{121888}{121950}...and fades away.
{121953}{122025}Are you the leader|of this group?
{122028}{122085}If there were a leader...
{122088}{122129}...I would be the one.
{122132}{122221}- So you have the answers?|- So you have questions?
{122272}{122326}What are we?
{122358}{122404}Nothing...
{122407}{122473}...if not vampires.
{122541}{122603}Who made us what we are?
{122606}{122655}Surely you know the one|who made you?
{122658}{122723}Yes, but the one|who made him?
{122726}{122757}The source...
{122760}{122814}...of all this...
{122818}{122864}...evil.
{122900}{122950}I understand.
{122973}{123041}I saw you in the theater.
{123062}{123128}Your suffering...
{123154}{123224}...your sympathy for that girl.
{123252}{123293}You die...
{123296}{123350}...when you kill.
{123356}{123466}You feel you deserve to die|and you stint on nothing.
{123494}{123562}But does that make you evil?
{123569}{123666}Since you comprehend what you call|goodness, doesn't that make you...
{123669}{123710}...good?
{123713}{123764}Then there is nothing?
{123767}{123827}Perhaps.
{123851}{123911}But perhaps...
{123936}{123981}...this...
{123984}{124064}...is the only real evil left.
{124078}{124142}Then God does not exist?
{124145}{124220}I know nothing of God.
{124227}{124270}Or the Devil.
{124273}{124374}I have never seen a vision,|nor learned a secret...
{124377}{124469}...that would damn|or save my soul.
{124498}{124537}As far as I know...
{124540}{124611}...after 400 years...
{124614}{124661}...I am the oldest...
{124664}{124712}...living vampire...
{124715}{124770}...in the world.
{124789}{124869}Then it's as I always feared.
{125068}{125133}You fear too much.
{125174}{125242}So much you make me fear...
{125357}{125417}The one who made you...
{125420}{125488}...should have told you this.
{125502}{125574}The one who left the|Old World for the New...
{125577}{125613}He knew nothing.
{125616}{125659}Nor did he care.
{125662}{125688}Knew?
{125691}{125743}Come, beloved.
{125749}{125802}It's time we were on our way.
{125805}{125831}I'm hungry...
{125834}{125880}...and the city awaits.
{125912}{125980}The place was empty|as we left.
{125983}{126029}Silent as the grave.
{126032}{126121}And as we blundered through it,|again came the thought:
{126124}{126179}"I have wronged Lestat."
{126182}{126237}"I have hated him|for the wrong reasons."
{126240}{126299}How did you wrong him?
{126336}{126375}You said a name.
{126378}{126446}Yes, a name I don't|care to say again.
{126449}{126497}There is but one crime...
{126500}{126567}...among us vampires here.
{126579}{126683}It is the crime that means|death to any vampire:
{126709}{126776}To kill your own kind.
{126862}{126943}- Do you think I'd let them harm you?|- No, you would not.
{126946}{126989}Danger holds you to me.
{126992}{127030}Love holds you to me.
{127033}{127073}- Love?|- Love.
{127076}{127169}You would leave me for Armand|if he beckoned you.
{127172}{127202}Never.
{127205}{127293}He wants you as you want him.|He's been waiting for you.
{127296}{127355}He wants you as a companion.
{127358}{127411}He bides his time there.
{127414}{127480}He finds it as dull|and lifeless as we do.
{127483}{127515}Perhaps.
{127518}{127634}Do you know what his soul said to me|without saying a word?
{127647}{127707}"Let him go," he said.
{127710}{127769}"Let him go."
{127797}{127872}Is that what I should do?
{127884}{127944}Let you go?
{127951}{127986}My father...
{127989}{128027}...my Louis...
{128030}{128087}...who made me?
{128114}{128178}It will be all right.
{128189}{128256}You really believe that?
{128439}{128466}The soldier...
{128469}{128524}...on returning from the war...
{128527}{128624}...thinks victory has enured|him against sorrow...
{128627}{128683}...till Death comes by...
{128686}{128756}...and chops him|from his horse.
{128893}{128957}I was waiting for you.
{129002}{129055}Listen to me.
{129099}{129165}Claudia is very dear to me.
{129168}{129199}She's my daughter.
{129202}{129257}Your lover.
{129260}{129296}No, my beloved.
{129299}{129354}My child.
{129373}{129442}You say so.|You're innocent.
{129452}{129504}She's in danger, isn't she?
{129507}{129557}- She is.|- Why?
{129611}{129687}I could give you reasons.
{129698}{129763}Her silence.
{129766}{129821}Her youth.
{129840}{129916}It's forbidden|to make one so young...
{129919}{129972}...so helpless...
{129975}{130033}...that cannot survive|on its own.
{130036}{130080}Then blame the one|who made her.
{130083}{130137}Did you kill this vampire|who made you both?
{130140}{130180}Is that why you won't say|his name?
{130183}{130225}Santiago thinks you did.
{130228}{130318}- We want no quarrel with him.|- It's already begun.
{130336}{130379}If you want to save her...
{130382}{130462}- ...send her away!|- Then I leave too.
{130613}{130669}So soon?
{130709}{130797}Without any of those answers|you so longed for?
{130800}{130830}You said there are none.
{130833}{130906}But you asked|the wrong questions.
{131283}{131331}Do you know...
{131334}{131402}...how few vampires...
{131409}{131493}...have the stamina|for immortality?
{131525}{131607}How quickly they perish|of their own will.
{131693}{131747}The world...
{131750}{131806}...changes.
{131838}{131895}We do not.
{131917}{131968}Therein lies the irony...
{131971}{132032}...that finally kills us.
{132035}{132135}I need you to make contact|with this age.
{132138}{132181}Me?
{132184}{132244}Don't you see?
{132247}{132327}I'm not the spirit|of any age.
{132330}{132381}I'm at odds with everything.
{132384}{132448}I always have been.
{132468}{132557}That is the very spirit|of your age.
{132573}{132629}The heart of it.
{132652}{132698}Your fall...
{132701}{132748}...from grace...
{132751}{132836}...has been the fall|of a century.
{132847}{132916}But the vampires|in the theater?
{132944}{132994}Decadent...
{132997}{133053}...useless.
{133072}{133141}They can't reflect anything.
{133144}{133178}But...
{133181}{133233}...you do.
{133270}{133299}You reflect...
{133302}{133362}...its broken heart.
{133657}{133720}A vampire...
{133737}{133804}...with a human soul.
{133816}{133907}An immortal|with a mortal's passion.
{133947}{133988}You...
{133991}{134043}...are...
{134062}{134130}...beautiful, my friend.
{134170}{134266}Lestat must have wept|when he made you.
{134329}{134389}You knew Lestat?
{134441}{134493}Yes.
{134504}{134559}I knew him.
{134587}{134687}Knew him well enough|not to mourn his passing.
{134738}{134814}I felt a kind of peace|at last.
{134817}{134945}I had found the teacher which Lestat|could never, I knew now, have been.
{134949}{135030}I knew knowledge would|never be withheld by Armand.
{135033}{135137}It would pass through him|as through a pane of glass.
{135493}{135545}Madeleine...
{135549}{135609}...Louis is shy.
{135983}{136033}Drink.
{136054}{136086}Do it.
{136089}{136167}Because I cannot do it.|I haven't the strength.
{136170}{136294}- You saw to that when you made me.|- You don't know what you ask!
{136335}{136355}I have.
{136358}{136458}You have found your new companion!|You will make me mine!
{136464}{136524}How do we seem to you?
{136529}{136582}Do you find us beautiful?
{136585}{136633}Magical?
{136636}{136764}Our white skin, our fierce eyes?|Do you know the thing you will become?
{136767}{136831}Your evil is that|you cannot be evil!
{136834}{136906}And I shall suffer|for it no longer!
{136909}{136977}Don't make me do this!|I cannot!
{136980}{137031}Yet, you could do it to me.
{137034}{137171}Snatching me from my mother's hands,|like two monsters in a fairy tale.
{137174}{137221}And now you weep!
{137224}{137300}I haven't tears enough|for what you've done to me!
{137303}{137356}You give her to me, Louis!
{137359}{137439}Do this before you leave me!
{137480}{137523}Oh, God!
{137526}{137581}I love you still!
{137584}{137656}That's the torment of it!
{137664}{137725}Who'll care for me,|my love...
{137728}{137818}...my dark angel,|when you are gone?
{137970}{138052}What do you think she is,|Madeleine?
{138074}{138128}A doll?
{138183}{138249}A child who cannot die.
{138262}{138330}And the child who did die?
{138360}{138416}My daughter.
{139820}{139859}What's happening to her?
{139862}{139918}She's dying.
{139922}{139978}It happened to you too...
{139981}{140065}...only you were too young|to remember.
{140095}{140159}But if she dies?
{140166}{140238}It's only mortal death.
{140310}{140388}Bear me no ill will, my love.
{140441}{140507}We are now even.
{140519}{140577}What do you mean?
{140594}{140694}What died in that room|was not that woman.
{140769}{140833}What has died is the...
{140850}{140918}...last breath in me...
{140923}{140987}...that was human.
{141075}{141137}Yes, Father.
{141144}{141210}At last we are even.
{141330}{141420}It's time for justice,|little one.
{141822}{141904}Get me Armand.|He wouldn't stand for this.
{141907}{141965}Death for the others.
{141968}{142004}For you...
{142007}{142082}...eternity in a box.
{142094}{142141}Walled in a dungeon.
{142144}{142223}Your only company|will be your screams.
{142232}{142307}Perhaps it will|take centuries.
{142331}{142378}Take them!
{144237}{144302}Pleasant dreams.
{144341}{144407}No! No!
{144416}{144470}Help!
{145348}{145397}Wake up!
{147055}{147105}Where's Claudia?
{147108}{147183}Claudia. I cannot help her.
{147186}{147266}- Where's Claudia?|- I can't save her!
{147299}{147368}I will only risk losing you!
{147405}{147455}Don't!
{150131}{150183}Come, Louis.
{150198}{150251}Not here.
{150445}{150520}So a vampire can cry?
{150558}{150593}Once...
{150596}{150662}...maybe twice, in eternity.
{150695}{150804}And maybe it was to quench those tears|forever that I took such revenge.
{152214}{152281}Stop him! It's burning!
{152284}{152341}Get him! Stop him!
{155463}{155538}You didn't even warn them,|did you?
{155571}{155616}No.
{155651}{155726}And you knew what I would do.
{155738}{155780}I knew.
{155783}{155834}I rescued you, didn't I?
{155837}{155902}From the terrible dawn.
{155993}{156061}You were their leader.|They trusted you.
{156064}{156108}No.
{156117}{156197}You made me see|their failings, Louis.
{156217}{156249}They were...
{156252}{156340}...doomed, stuck|in their decadent time.
{156346}{156414}They had forgotten|the first lesson...
{156417}{156469}...that we must be powerful...
{156472}{156506}...beautiful...
{156509}{156570}...and without regret.
{156576}{156615}You can teach me this?
{156618}{156657}Yes.
{156660}{156728}To be without regret?
{156764}{156839}Then, what a pair|we could make.
{156890}{156986}But what if it's a lesson|I don't care to learn?
{157009}{157041}What?
{157044}{157115}What if all I have|is my suffering?
{157118}{157182}My regret?
{157206}{157254}Don't you want to lose it?
{157257}{157325}So you can have that too?
{157328}{157390}The heart that mourns her...
{157393}{157449}...whom you burnt to a cinder?
{157452}{157491}I swear I didn't...
{157494}{157553}But I know you did.
{157557}{157608}I know...
{157627}{157670}...you...
{157673}{157734}...regret nothing.
{157764}{157816}You feel...
{157819}{157867}...nothing.
{157898}{157979}If that's all|I have left to learn...
{158002}{158070}...I can do that on my own.
{158312}{158346}I will die.
{158349}{158367}No.
{158370}{158408}You are dead.
{158411}{158496}And you want me to|quicken you once more.
{158537}{158644}And as much as your invitation|might appeal to me...
{158662}{158713}...I must regretfully...
{158716}{158764}...decline.
{159067}{159121}For years I wandered:
{159124}{159180}Italy, Greece...
{159183}{159239}...all the ancient lands.
{159242}{159305}But the world was a tomb to me...
{159308}{159389}...a graveyard|full of broken statues.
{159392}{159498}And each of those statues|resembled her face.
{159630}{159675}Then, out of curiosity...
{159678}{159729}...boredom, who knows what...
{159732}{159771}...I left the Old World...
{159774}{159848}...and came back|to my America.
{159909}{160017}And there a mechanical wonder|allowed me to see the sunrise...
{160020}{160067}...for the first time...
{160070}{160134}...in 200 years.
{160147}{160205}And what sunrises!
{160208}{160298}Seen as the human eye|could never see them.
{160301}{160361}Silver at first...
{160364}{160442}...then, as the years progressed,|in tones of purple...
{160445}{160476}...red...
{160479}{160557}...and my long-lost blue.
{160656}{160756}In the spring of 1988,|I returned to New Orleans.
{160762}{160868}And as soon as I smelled|the air, I knew I was home.
{160881}{160916}It was rich...
{160919}{160962}...almost sweet...
{160965}{161085}...like the fragrance of jasmine|and roses around our old courtyard.
{161102}{161230}I walked the streets savoring|that long-lost perfume.
{161348}{161402}And then on Prytania Street...
{161405}{161483}...only blocks from the|Lafayette cemetery...
{161486}{161552}...I caught the scent of death.
{161555}{161635}And it wasn't coming|from the graves.
{161657}{161727}The scent grew stronger|as I walked.
{161730}{161775}Old death.
{161778}{161862}A scent too faint|for mortals to detect.
{164148}{164218}I'm so glad you are here!
{164221}{164279}I've dreamed...
{164282}{164346}...of this moment.
{164367}{164439}She never should|have been one of...
{164442}{164483}...us.
{164486}{164554}That's all past, Lestat.
{164651}{164707}Past.
{165272}{165344}Still beautiful, Louis.
{165393}{165473}You always were|the strong one.
{165560}{165620}Don't be frightened.
{165704}{165770}I mean you no harm.
{165844}{165914}You've come home|to me then?
{166008}{166086}You remember how I was?
{166119}{166162}The vampire...
{166165}{166229}...that I was?
{166238}{166298}Yes, I remember.
{166440}{166470}No one...
{166473}{166535}...could refuse me...
{166555}{166609}...not even you.
{166630}{166679}I tried.
{166682}{166746}Yes, you tried.
{166761}{166829}And the more you tried...
{166915}{166981}...the more I wanted you.
{167222}{167284}I can't bear it.
{167326}{167380}Such lights...
{167401}{167461}...and that noise!
{167483}{167575}They make the night|brighter than the day.
{167766}{167818}It's false light.
{167821}{167883}It can't harm you.
{168146}{168228}If you stay with me, Louis...
{168246}{168313}...I could venture out again.
{168369}{168439}Become the old Lestat.
{168459}{168523}I must leave now.
{169207}{169291}Whatever happened to Lestat,|I do not know.
{169307}{169344}I go on...
{169347}{169392}...night after night.
{169395}{169475}I feed on those|who cross my path.
{169524}{169622}But all my passion went|with her golden hair.
{169683}{169775}I'm a spirit|of preternatural flesh.
{169787}{169847}Detached.
{169850}{169902}Unchangeable.
{169956}{170006}Empty.
{170014}{170053}Empty?
{170056}{170104}That's it?
{170142}{170208}No, it can't end like that.
{170229}{170268}But it has.
{170271}{170333}There's no more to tell.
{170338}{170470}There must be more to tell. You don't|understand yourself. You're not empty.
{170473}{170554}What I wouldn't give to be like you,|to have your power...
{170557}{170616}...to have seen the things|you have seen.
{170619}{170654}You haven't been listening.
{170657}{170727}I have been listening.|Your story is incredible.
{170730}{170780}- It's amazing.|- Do what you want with it.
{170783}{170850}Give it to others.|Learn what you can.
{170853}{170948}There's only one way I'll|truly learn and you know it.
{170951}{171019}You brought me here|for a reason.
{171022}{171048}Didn't you?
{171051}{171096}What reason would that be?
{171099}{171200}You want a companion. You want a link|to the outside world. That's me.
{171203}{171262}Take me.|That's what I want.
{171265}{171357}- I refuse to let it end like this.|- God, I've failed again.
{171360}{171452}You haven't failed.|God has nothing to do with it.
{171512}{171565}Do you like this?
{171568}{171657}Do you like being food|for the immortals?
{171660}{171692}Do you like dying?
{171695}{171741}Stop!
{173416}{173482}1791 was the year|it happened.
{173485}{173583}I was 24.|Younger than you are now.
{173587}{173663}But times were different then.|I was a man at that age.
{173666}{173772}The master of a large plantation,|just south of New Orleans.
{173787}{173853}I had lost my wife|in childbirth.
{173856}{173899}Someone change my shorts.
{173902}{173978}She and the infant had been|buried less than half a year.
{173981}{173999}It's good stuff.
{174002}{174036}I would've been happy|to join them.
{174039}{174101}Good stuff.
{174171}{174245}I assume|I need no introduction.
{174590}{174658}I feel better already.
{174746}{174829}Most of all,|I longed for death.
{174832}{174890}I invited it.
{174899}{174981}A release|from the pain of living.
{175049}{175111}Still whining.
{175159}{175202}Heard enough?
{175205}{175286}I've had to listen to that|for centuries.
{175335}{175388}Don't be afraid.
{175430}{175508}I'm going to give you|the choice...
{175514}{175576}...I never had.
