{913}{991}My father took these.|He was a maniac for the camera.
{1025}{1081}That's me.
{1114}{1185}That's Felipe and Nando.
{1217}{1322}That's Alex Morales,|he died instantly.
{1356}{1427}That's Antonio, captain of the team.
{1463}{1551}After 20 years, you analyse a lot.
{1556}{1651}You remember people, heroism.
{1654}{1766}"The Miracle of the Andes",|that's what they called it.
{1769}{1834}Many people come up to me and say
{1838}{1926}that had they been there,|they surely would have died.
{1931}{1993}But that makes no sense.
{1997}{2100}Because until you're|in a situation like that,
{2144}{2239}you have no idea how you'll behave.
{2333}{2425}To be affronted by solitude|without decadence,
{2429}{2529}or a single material thing|to prostitute it
{2533}{2600}elevates you to a spiritual plane...
{2656}{2737}...where I felt the presence of God.
{2775}{2871}There's the God|they taught me about at school...
{2921}{3027}...and there is the God that's hidden
{3032}{3131}by what surrounds us|in this civilisation.
{3151}{3234}That's the God I met on the mountain.
{3876}{3933}- Could you get me some tea?|- Yes, sir.
{3937}{3994}- Want some tea?|- No, thanks.
{3998}{4044}That's it.
{4160}{4250}- Come on! Give me the ball!|- Over here!
{4387}{4431}Watch out!
{4455}{4500}Where did you stay in Paris?
{4504}{4601}- Excuse me, please.|- Paris is not for you, Canessa.
{4604}{4677}- Why not?|- You're too intense.
{4682}{4809}How can I justify that to the guys?|He's missed practice the last two weeks.
{4812}{4899}- He's all right.|- He missed the plane, too.
{4904}{4985}I'm team captain. I'll say what's OK.
{4989}{5142}If you want to play in a rugby team,|you have to give 100%. Right?
{5146}{5244}Everybody to the right of the plane.|Let's get in.
{5248}{5302}Let me get in.
{5305}{5361}OK. Juan, Roy.
{5466}{5509}- Mama, look.|- What?
{5513}{5617}- The mountains are so beautiful.|- Don't make me look.
{5622}{5722}- They look like big teeth.|- We'll land in 20 minutes.
{5725}{5831}Good. Let's talk about something else.|Have a chocolate.
{5861}{5897}Thank you.
{6037}{6090}It's clouding up a bit.
{6391}{6500}- Just stay above the weather.|- No problem.
{6505}{6597}What's more important to you?|Rugby or girls?
{6602}{6686}Girls. You?
{6690}{6729}Girls.
{6732}{6853}- But when I'm playing, it's rugby.|- Unless girls are watching?
{6857}{6899}Right.
{6962}{7070}Come on, switch seats.|I want to see the mountains.
{7106}{7183}Don't climb on the seats, OK?
{7187}{7262}- Watch yourself.|- All right, I'm moving.
{7317}{7398}Uruguayan 571, cleared to 10,000ft.|Thank you.
{7403}{7460}- Your tea, sir.|- Thank you.
{7477}{7571}Turning on the seat belt signs.|Get those kids seated.
{7575}{7665}We're going to hit some weather|on our approach.
{7983}{8072}We'll be landing soon.|Everybody, please sit down.
{8119}{8202}Do you think they hear you?
{8267}{8311}Come on now. Sit down.
{8779}{8853}- See? Now sit!|- Anything to calm your nerves.
{8951}{8981}What's going on?
{9009}{9039}Look at Alonso.
{9043}{9148}Put on your parachutes!|We're jumping into the Andes!
{9153}{9272}- Put that down and sit down.|- All right, all right.
{9494}{9554}Put that cigarette out.
{9939}{10006}- My God!|- You OK?
{10025}{10103}- Nando, is everything all right?|- Yes, just an air pocket.
{10122}{10191}Mom, it scared me, too.
{10545}{10596}Mother of God, no!
{10601}{10709}- Oh, shit! What happened?|- Full throttle. Come on!
{10729}{10759}What happened?
{10762}{10834}Are we supposed to fly|that close to the mountains?
{10872}{10950}Hail Mary, full of grace,|the Lord is with Thee...
{11576}{11635}Power! We need more power!
{11656}{11689}I can't...!
{14021}{14115}- Oh, man!|- It's stopped.
{14126}{14173}Jesus!
{14219}{14287}I think I'm all right. Alex?
{14440}{14529}- He's dead!|- Zerbino, are you OK?
{14533}{14611}People are hurt. I've only been|in med school six months.
{14615}{14713}- Help me out.|- Eduardo. Where's he going?
{14740}{14806}- Is Canessa OK?|- Yes...
{14809}{14867}- Where's Eduardo?|- He went back.
{14871}{14958}- Eduardo, come back here.|- Help Canessa. Help him.
{14962}{15011}Lilliana!
{15099}{15140}I'm all right.
{15213}{15270}I can't breathe.
{15274}{15391}It's the altitude. You're OK.|Just relax and breathe.
{15395}{15468}- What should I do?|- Look up there.
{15485}{15588}Canessa! Help Federico.
{15592}{15689}- His leg is cut.|- I'm fine. Help the wounded.
{15694}{15821}- I saved us by saying Hail Mary.|- Move out the way.
{15859}{15888}What should I do?
{15918}{15991}- Go get some air.|- OK.
{16090}{16144}Just sit right there.
{16170}{16248}I'm going to use a handkerchief|to clean your nose.
{16439}{16551}Bobby! Bobby Francois!
{16606}{16670}Hey, Carlitos! Smoke?
{16675}{16721}Yeah.
{17062}{17123}Stay with me, please.
{17173}{17238}There's two dead in baggage.
{17242}{17315}- Please!|- Stay with Felipe.
{17444}{17542}- Easy, ma'am, easy.|- My legs!
{17547}{17664}Yes, ma'am,|I'm sorry about your legs.
{17667}{17732}- Roy, are you hurt?|- I don't know.
{17736}{17807}Come on, then. Help me. Come on.
{17936}{18019}Take the other side.|One, two, three!
{18084}{18135}- Alberto.|- Dead.
{18273}{18439}I'm not dead. Never felt worse|in my life, but I am not dead.
{18469}{18517}All right. Let's move this stuff.
{18550}{18626}Be careful! Both my legs are broken.
{18709}{18747}How's Nando?
{18827}{18859}I don't think so.
{18903}{19007}Maybe it's just as well.|His mother's dead.
{19011}{19081}- Please.|- Other people are hurt.
{19113}{19202}- I'll stay with you.|- Thank you.
{19207}{19254}- Got a minute?|- What, Pablo?
{19258}{19337}It's this. Is it serious?
{19434}{19484}- Forget it. You're OK.|- You think so?
{19488}{19586}Don't worry. Give me a hand|with this seat over here.
{19609}{19639}Come on.
{19736}{19805}Here. Tie it up|and I'll see to it later.
{20554}{20600}Water.
{20714}{20887}Mama! Mama, I want to go home!|I want to go home!
{20935}{20984}Sit her down here.
{21144}{21283}- You better see the pilot.|- OK. Help me move her.
{21287}{21431}- One more try, Mrs Alfonsin.|- No, don't! You'll kill me!
{21436}{21493}Let them do it, ma'am.|They've got to do it.
{21506}{21557}Maybe we shouldn't.
{21736}{21787}One, two, three, pull!
{21792}{21821}Stop!
{21826}{21906}- Stop! Stop!|- We're going to kill her!
{21968}{22023}- I gotta stop.|- This is horrible!
{22027}{22105}- All right!|- Don't touch it!
{22109}{22230}- Let's make some room in here.|- Watch his leg.
{22333}{22391}Water. Water.
{22609}{22721}- Hand me some snow.|- Here.
{22814}{22886}Where's the radio?|We should call Santiago.
{22922}{23028}We passed Curico. We passed Curico.
{23031}{23112}- My friend, the radio...|- My bag.
{23124}{23174}How do we call Santiago?
{23178}{23254}11... 300.
{23259}{23303}I got the dial.
{23307}{23398}11, 300. OK.
{23456}{23548}- It's dead. There's no power at all.|- My bag.
{23553}{23662}- He wants his bag.|- I don't see it.
{23666}{23696}We're looking. What's in it?
{23700}{23820}My... My...
{23824}{23868}My gun.
{24024}{24085}No, my friend,|we can't be a part of that.
{24171}{24245}Put this up on that side.
{24269}{24316}My hands are freezing!
{24386}{24533}Well, it's too late.|The rescuers will never see us today.
{24538}{24626}- We'll have to spend the night.|- How will they find us?
{24630}{24687}Don't worry, they'll find us.
{24729}{24796}The temperature will drop after dark.|Maybe 30, 40 degrees.
{24800}{24877}Don't worry. We'll deal with that.
{24909}{25014}- I'm cold.|- The covers can be used as blankets.
{25018}{25188}That's a good idea. Everybody|unzip the covers to use as blankets.
{25193}{25255}- How's your stomach?|- Good. Fine.
{25260}{25311}Good.
{25340}{25418}- Who's that?|- Canessa. Come on!
{25455}{25531}I thought it was just a coat,|but there he was.
{25652}{25738}- Are you hurt?|- Identify yourself!
{25743}{25854}My name is Roberto Canessa.|I'm a medical student.
{25888}{25966}I'm a member of the rugby team|that chartered this plane.
{26005}{26104}You're a member of the flight crew,|aren't you?
{26108}{26160}Aren't you?
{26174}{26325}- Yes. I'm the mechanic.|- Do you know how to fix radios?
{26342}{26385}No.
{26558}{26629}- You took this coat off a girl.|- No!
{26633}{26772}- You're right. This is Anna Parrado's.|- Put it back on her.
{26776}{26852}Take it off her again, I'll kill you.
{26901}{26951}- Excuse me.|- How you doing?
{26955}{27024}- I'm going to bed.|- That way?
{27028}{27127}Come on, Eduardo.|He bumped his head.
{27461}{27512}Hey, Roberto?
{27546}{27624}- Want some wine?|- Thanks.
{27751}{27799}Where'd you get wine?
{27828}{27945}Hugo found a shitload of bottles.|He thinks it was the pilot's.
{27948}{28039}It would explain|how he flew his plane.
{28097}{28221}- We're completely screwed.|- I don't know.
{28357}{28430}Get back there and help the others.
{28667}{28717}We're gonna be fine.
{28741}{28818}Who are you trying to convince,|Antonio?
{28923}{28998}I had no premonition.
{29101}{29138}So much for ESP.
{29224}{29287}That was a good idea|about the seat covers.
{29319}{29362}Thank you.
{29393}{29482}- Have some wine.|- Thanks.
{29537}{29677}- Got all the covers.|- Put them inside. Near the front.
{30593}{30731}I'm dying!|My sweet God in Heaven, the pain!
{30756}{30848}- I'm in so much pain.|- It must be terrible.
{30851}{30934}Calm yourself.|God will take care of you.
{30939}{30975}My legs!
{31025}{31136}God forgive you all|for not helping me! I'm in agony!
{31141}{31248}Shut up! Shut up, you stupid cow,|or I'll punch your face in!
{31378}{31518}I swear to God, I will! Shut up!
{31891}{32006}- God, it's cold! It's too cold!|- Antonio!
{32021}{32123}It's too cold.|We're going to freeze.
{32127}{32157}Roy!
{32192}{32237}Roy!
{32245}{32373}Roy! Come on, Roy.|We've got to stuff up this hole.
{32377}{32429}Come on, or we'll freeze to death!
{32433}{32482}- With what?|- Luggage and stuff.
{32486}{32564}- I'm so cold.|- Grab a suitcase.
{32569}{32629}- What are you doing? I'm freezing!|- You, too.
{32648}{32699}We've got to stuff up this hole.
{32703}{32780}Help me with this seat, Rafael.
{32784}{32922}Put it on the bottom|with the suitcases. Give me a hand.
{33105}{33139}Carlitos?
{33185}{33245}- Are you awake?|- Are you serious?
{33250}{33346}Know what I think?|I think Nando's not so bad.
{33426}{33517}- I don't know.|- Let's keep him warm between us.
{33616}{33686}Be careful with his head.
{33690}{33741}Move him over.
{33787}{33824}Blanket.
{33849}{33986}- Hugo's trying to revive Nando.|- Look, I've done enough!
{33989}{34117}I hate these idiots. Shut up|or I'll hate you, too! Leave me alone.
{34170}{34205}I feel sick.
{34227}{34338}Here. Try and sleep, Javier.
{34471}{34566}It's just altitude sickness.|Don't be scared.
{34599}{34639}Thanks.
{35493}{35570}- Well, we have cigarettes.|- Yeah.
{35575}{35618}How will they find us?
{35623}{35750}They must know about where we went|down. Don't worry, they'll find us.
{36014}{36071}What happened?|You knocked your head.
{36076}{36169}- We crashed?|- Yeah.
{36173}{36211}Unbelievable.
{36237}{36339}He's dead. Help me move him out.
{36343}{36416}- He's dead?|- Yeah.
{36420}{36537}Help move him to the back. We have|to clear the cabin in situations like this.
{36540}{36621}Come on, Carlitos, help me.
{36625}{36736}- How are you, Susana?|- My feet hurt.
{36762}{36882}Anybody with a broken arm or leg|should go and lay it in the snow.
{36887}{36947}It'll help the swelling go down.
{37284}{37333}They've gotten cold.
{37362}{37452}- How's that?|- Thank you.
{37634}{37748}- What's the story in here?|- They're both dead.
{37766}{37810}You're the mechanic, right?
{37883}{37946}- Do you have any signal flares?|- No.
{37950}{38034}- Emergency supplies?|- No. Nothing like that.
{38037}{38136}- What's wrong with him?|- What's wrong with you?
{38200}{38236}What about the radio?
{38292}{38384}- What about the radio?|- Can it be made to work?
{38401}{38477}Not without batteries!
{38493}{38537}Well, are there batteries?
{38576}{38711}The batteries are in the tail,|and the tails gone!
{38829}{38925}He's crazy. Anyway,|it doesn't matter about the radio.
{38928}{39010}They'll find us|with or without the radio.
{39015}{39113}- Are you sure?|- I haven't a doubt in my mind.
{39409}{39439}Who's that?
{39488}{39577}The woman who was screaming|all night, Mrs Alfonsin.
{39581}{39649}- Don't tell me it's her.|- What's the matter?
{39677}{39757}I yelled at her,|told her to shut up.
{39781}{39929}- We all wanted to, Carlitos.|- But I did. Now she's dead.
{39965}{40013}I'm so ashamed.
{40073}{40169}- God forgive me!|- Take it easy.
{40270}{40363}Our Father, who art in heaven,|hallowed be thy name.
{40367}{40470}Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,|on Earth as it is in Heaven.
{40473}{40569}Give us this day our daily bread,|and forgive us our trespasses
{40573}{40640}as we forgive those|who trespass against us.
{40644}{40716}Lead us not into temptation|but deliver us from evil. Amen.
{40761}{40832}Chocolate peanuts,|small chocolate bars,
{40837}{40949}four bottles of wine, half bottle|of rum and nine crackers.
{40954}{41033}- How many of us?|- Twenty-seven.
{41037}{41070}We're gonna starve.
{41091}{41216}This weather can't last. There'll|be helicopters coming this afternoon.
{41220}{41280}But we'll be careful|and ration what we have.
{41284}{41349}I like a big lunch.
{41353}{41431}One capful of wine,|one square of chocolate each.
{41435}{41568}- I prefer a big lunch to dinner.|- Come on. Form a line.
{41612}{41651}Careful.
{41716}{41771}Thank you|for the teeny chocolate piece.
{41775}{41806}You're welcome.
{41809}{41875}- Fill this. It's not for me.|- Then who?
{41879}{41934}- Nando.|- He's unconscious.
{41939}{42008}- He still gets a share.|- Give it to him.
{42123}{42205}The king is generous today.
{42376}{42415}Lift up his head.
{42570}{42666}- He looks better.|- Yeah. He looks fabulous.
{42718}{42791}- Thank God we have cigarettes.|- Thousands.
{42796}{42879}I could smoke till my brain dries up.
{42955}{42984}What's that?
{43077}{43130}It's an aeroplane!
{43183}{43247}It's the search party!
{43455}{43561}If we can't see them,|they can't see us.
{44423}{44532}- What is that you're humming?|- "The Look of Love. "
{44586}{44638}How beautiful.
{44684}{44728}I'm thinking about our children.
{44732}{44799}Yeah. Me, too.
{44848}{44892}Home.
{45932}{46024}There's one of these|inside the back of each chair.
{46029}{46064}Snow.
{46104}{46193}- It'll melt and make water.|- You're a genius!
{46198}{46273}This is terrific. Make more of these.
{46277}{46424}I'll mark off a square where no one's|to piss. Daniel, come help me.
{46504}{46592}- Antonio has dictator potential.|- No comment.
{46752}{46815}- Coche?|- Yeah?
{46818}{46889}Play "Flight of the Bumble Bee".
{46893}{46942}Fuck you.
{47135}{47247}To be fair to this dilemma,|it is a beautiful spot.
{47251}{47359}Not a tree, not a bird,|not a blade of grass.
{47363}{47420}Yeah, paradise.
{47424}{47500}Can you help? There's things to do.
{47504}{47548}Stuff it, Roy!
{47634}{47707}I'll pay for the pizza,|if you get it.
{47839}{47954}- How are you doing?|- Let me sleep.
{47958}{48028}- Canessa.|- What?
{48032}{48085}Canessa, look at Nando.
{48089}{48220}I think he's all right.|I think he's waking up.
{48223}{48316}Nando? Nando.
{48320}{48371}See? I told you.
{48402}{48488}Don't grind your teeth,|you'll ruin your smile.
{48568}{48707}Focus on me. Come on.|Focus on me. Focus on me.
{48894}{48927}Roberto Canessa.
{48931}{48976}He knows you!
{49017}{49053}What happened?
{49112}{49156}We crashed.
{49250}{49296}My mother?
{49350}{49383}She's dead.
{49543}{49581}Nando, listen!
{49585}{49615}Forget her.
{49638}{49681}Your sister's alive. Susana's alive.
{49686}{49733}But she's hurt. She needs you.
{49737}{49797}- Where is she?|- You need to rest.
{49802}{49882}Where is she? Where is she?
{49937}{49967}Susana!
{50034}{50081}Nando?
{50100}{50147}Susana?
{50367}{50429}I'm here now.
{51939}{51996}There's a plane! Come on!
{52147}{52235}- Can they see us?|- Of course they can!
{52239}{52285}Here we are!
{52404}{52455}He dipped his wings!
{52504}{52609}- The wings did dip! I saw it!|- You saw it, too?
{52614}{52675}I knew they would find us!
{52756}{52786}We're saved!
{52847}{52911}We're going home!
{52927}{52993}Pizza for everybody!
{53182}{53274}We're going home, Federico!|We're going home.
{53335}{53413}- How are you guys doing?|- Fine.
{53417}{53474}Drink some of this.
{53478}{53611}- What about the rationing?|- We've been seen. Drink.
{54458}{54514}Antonio's asleep.
{54518}{54568}Roy's asleep, too.
{54572}{54695}He even sleeps to Antonio's beat.|He's like his dog.
{54718}{54772}Carlitos, pass the piss pot.
{54906}{54963}- How will they save us?|- Helicopters.
{54967}{55063}- A big plane.|- There's no place to land.
{55068}{55169}- We landed.|- Yeah, right! We landed like that.
{55248}{55362}- What is that?|- Chocolate.
{55383}{55484}- It's only got to last till tomorrow.|- He's right. Give me a piece.
{55538}{55597}Should you be doing that?
{55601}{55687}Why not? It's over.|They're coming in the morning.
{55691}{55779}We should wait until|we see the helicopters.
{56391}{56463}- How are you feeling?|- Not bad. Time to eat?
{56468}{56514}Yeah.
{56721}{56794}- Where are they?|- They're coming.
{56819}{56885}It's gonna be dark soon.
{56928}{57011}What is this? What the hell is this?!
{57015}{57066}What's the matter?
{57086}{57223}Am I losing my mind?|I must be losing my mind.
{57227}{57297}Who has been in this box?
{57301}{57413}What pig has been in this box?
{57418}{57495}Don't you know that you're playing|with our lives?
{57499}{57564}There's virtually nothing left!
{57591}{57705}Why didn't you take a knife|and slit our throats while we slept?
{57709}{57741}Who was it?
{57868}{57925}Who was it?
{57949}{57986}It was me.
{58029}{58081}I can't believe it!
{58128}{58264}- I thought they were picking us up.|- It could be a land rescue!
{58268}{58422}They may have to come here on foot!|It could take days, a week!
{58426}{58494}We have nothing to eat!|We're trapped!
{58498}{58555}I thought|they were coming this morning.
{58559}{58630}Who are you to risk my life?
{58634}{58732}- Who are you against us?|- It wasn't just him. I did it, too.
{58735}{58773}Me, too.
{58777}{58817}I ate chocolate.
{58821}{58955}Everybody took something,|except for maybe Javier and Lilliana.
{58959}{59007}I only didn't because I'm nauseous.
{59010}{59058}Not to me!
{59208}{59263}Am I the leader of this group?
{59267}{59303}I don't know. Are you?
{59339}{59422}I'm the captain of the team.
{59426}{59550}Is this still a team or a bunch|of cut-throats out to kill each other?
{59601}{59651}Answer me!
{59694}{59779}- Shall we take a vote?|- We don't need to. You're leader.
{59921}{59965}Answer me this, Antonio.
{59969}{60064}If they spotted us,|even if it is a land rescue,
{60068}{60127}why haven't they dropped supplies?
{60229}{60343}They could have done that.|They would have done that by now.
{60786}{60937}I have an idea to build two hammocks|for Federico and Alberto.
{60941}{61022}It would be better for their legs.|You gonna help me, Zerbino?
{61026}{61092}- Sure.|- I'll help, too.
{61127}{61205}I saw some poles and straps.|I'm sure we can do it.
{61237}{61304}It's been five days.
{61308}{61362}This is the fifth day.
{61387}{61430}I'm hungry.
{61579}{61645}- Lift it up.|- OK.
{61700}{61816}Just like new.|OK, we need two more belts.
{61881}{61996}- Look! It's a radio!|- I wish it were a transmitter.
{62000}{62098}- Does it work?|- I hear static.
{62103}{62226}Better give it to Antonio right away,|before he starts yelling.
{62251}{62353}- We gonna get this done before dark?|- Sure.
{62469}{62521}I can hear something.
{62525}{62563}We'll have to make an aerial.
{62567}{62679}Where are the planes?|Where are the planes?!
{62897}{62999}- How is she?|- I don't know. She's asleep.
{63003}{63048}And how are you, Nando?
{63068}{63151}Me? Fine. All right.
{63207}{63272}There's no helicopters yet.
{63310}{63390}- She's dying.|- You can't know that.
{63417}{63535}And when she's dead, I'm gonna climb|out of these goddamned mountains,
{63540}{63616}back to my father,|to my room and my house.
{63620}{63699}- How? You'll freeze.|- Not if I wear enough.
{63703}{63746}You'd starve to death.
{63750}{63861}You can't climb a mountain on a piece|of chocolate and a sip of wine.
{63864}{63978}Then I'll cut some meat|off the pilots.
{64008}{64087}After all,|they got us into this mess.
{64264}{64320}How you doing?
{64324}{64386}OK. You?
{64430}{64511}I'm better.|At least I'm off the floor.
{64516}{64552}Right.
{64557}{64598}How's your leg?
{64646}{64684}I don't know.
{64723}{64763}Mine are bad.
{64906}{64954}It'll be OK.
{65609}{65674}Have you looked at Alberto's legs?
{65716}{65745}Yeah.
{65760}{65831}Alberto's legs|are much worse than mine.
{65905}{65998}Alberto has some problems|and you have some problems.
{66381}{66457}Let me tell you something, Roberto.
{66461}{66563}My name is Federico Aranda|and I will return.
{66616}{66651}OK.
{66655}{66824}Alberto's in much worse shape than me.|We've got to keep an eye on Alberto.
{66828}{66894}OK. OK, Federico.
{66974}{67008}Shut up! Shut up!
{67045}{67091}Don't talk that way!
{67138}{67180}All I said was...
{67184}{67248}- Don't say it again.|- What's happening?
{67252}{67311}Antonio heard on the radio|that no planes have seen us.
{67316}{67359}- Yet.|- Looks bad.
{67363}{67418}Shut up, Rafael.
{67421}{67489}We're gonna have to climb, find the tail.
{67492}{67540}The batteries are in the tail.
{67545}{67655}Then we can work the transmitter,|call for help.
{67660}{67785}We've got to do something. We're|going to starve. Tomorrow, we climb.
{68172}{68241}How much further is it?
{68245}{68280}Come on!
{68366}{68400}Come on!
{68404}{68471}Canessa, I can't go on.
{68479}{68519}I'm dying for breath.
{68523}{68627}Come on. Let's take one more push.
{68665}{68724}Let's do it! That's it.
{68862}{68923}Grab my feet. Hold on to them!
{68927}{68967}Hold on! I got you.
{69227}{69298}Pull me up! Pull me up!
{69860}{69923}That was terrible.
{69982}{70063}I could use some oxygen.
{70067}{70137}Yeah. Me, too.
{70191}{70268}We're gonna have to go back.
{70272}{70324}This is harder than I thought.
{70328}{70380}I'm so weak.
{70400}{70492}- Know what Nando said?|- What?
{70497}{70617}He said if he gets too weak,|he'll eat one of the pilots.
{70622}{70686}You know, for crashing the plane.
{70792}{70903}We better get back.|When the sun drops, we'll freeze.
{71284}{71427}Curico. The Pilot said we'd just|passed Curico. There, well into Chile.
{71432}{71489}- Where did you find the map?|- I found it.
{71493}{71552}He's made a science of it.
{71580}{71694}This valley opens only to the east.|It leads deeper into the mountains.
{71698}{71814}The way out is to the west.|To the west is Chile.
{71830}{71919}Over these mountains|are the green valleys of Chile.
{71923}{72005}- Forget that.|- Alberto has a map.
{72009}{72070}It'll take more than a map|to get out.
{72075}{72146}A little hill just kicked our asses.
{72150}{72209}Climb a mountain? Who, Superman?
{72229}{72337}At this altitude with no food,|we're weak as kittens.
{72340}{72379}I'll tell you right now.
{72444}{72519}Either we're saved or we're dead.
{73068}{73149}The time has come. No more bullshit.
{73153}{73235}We've got to pray, man.|Let's say the rosary.
{73261}{73339}I'm not saying the rosary, Carlitos.|I'm an agnostic.
{73344}{73435}Don't say it, then.|See if God saves you.
{73439}{73509}Anybody else want to roll the dice|that way, fine!
{73721}{73804}Hail Mary, full of grace,|the Lord is with Thee.
{73808}{73859}Blessed art thou amongst women
{73863}{73941}and blessed is the fruit|of thy womb, Jesus.
{73946}{73998}Holy Mary, mother of God,
{74001}{74144}pray for us sinners, now|and at the hour of our death. Amen.
{75634}{75758}I'm not God, you know?|I can't save you.
{75762}{75856}I can't be responsible.
{75860}{75942}I tried because I'm captain,|but who could do this?
{75945}{76022}Who has the strength?|Who has the strength?
{76026}{76155}Don't be a fool.|That's right, you're not God.
{76160}{76248}Don't take so much on|and you won't feel so bad.
{76252}{76321}Everybody knows you've done plenty|to keep us together.
{76343}{76416}I can't help it.|I think of my mother.
{76435}{76532}I think about my children.|It's the same for me.
{76537}{76608}And you'll see them again.
{76612}{76697}I know I will. I know I will.
{76739}{76805}Susana's dead.
{76918}{76959}My sister's dead.
{77031}{77078}I'm sorry, Nando.
{77217}{77343}I'll keep her by me tonight,|and tomorrow I'll take her out.
{77893}{77950}She won't need her coat.
{78382}{78434}I can't believe it, Roy.
{78521}{78570}I can't believe it.
{78629}{78698}They've called off the search.
{78703}{78733}They've given up.
{78832}{78880}They think we're dead.
{78896}{79003}I'll kill you! I'll kill you!|You promised me!
{79190}{79230}What's going on?
{79275}{79378}I heard on the radio.|They called off the search.
{79494}{79549}Get up. Go tell the others.
{79588}{79695}I can't.|It'll kill everybody's hope.
{79765}{79814}What's so great about hope?
{79990}{80049}Daniel! Get everybody together.
{80170}{80239}All right, all right.|Is everybody here?
{80243}{80288}Yeah, we're all here.
{80316}{80420}OK. Listen,|I got something to tell you.
{80425}{80508}Good news,|they called off the search.
{80512}{80550}How is that good news?
{80555}{80613}'Cause we're going|to get out on our own.
{80617}{80747}We're gonna save ourselves.|Chile's to the west, right?
{80752}{80821}- That's right.|- He's crazy!
{80835}{80908}It won't work. When we climbed,|we had no strength.
{80912}{81043}- It's true.|- That's 'cause you had no food.
{81047}{81150}If the search is off,|we're alone and we've got to eat!
{81154}{81184}Eat what?
{81528}{81570}No.
{81597}{81646}The dead?
{81689}{81774}- No.|- He means we should eat the dead.
{81858}{81908}That's right.
{81934}{81991}We should eat the dead.
{82031}{82067}We must face it.
{82091}{82155}Nando. Nando!
{82200}{82241}- Nando's right.|- What?
{82244}{82326}I can't believe this!|You, too, Roberto?
{82330}{82389}You're talking about eating people!
{82393}{82481}I'm talking about eating meat,|so we don't die.
{82499}{82577}- I couldn't do it.|- It's disgusting.
{82581}{82629}It's disgusting, so what?
{82667}{82775}If my wound needed washing, wouldn't|you do it even if it was disgusting?
{82780}{82839}I would, but I wouldn't eat you.
{82843}{82897}- Shut up!|- Sorry.
{82900}{82975}Do you believe we have a soul|that leaves our body?
{82979}{83054}- I don't know. I'm not a priest!|- OK.
{83059}{83175}- I don't want to talk about it.|- We have to. We're starving.
{83178}{83285}If the soul leaves the body|when we die, the body is a carcass.
{83290}{83342}This is the beginning of the end.
{83347}{83459}What's out there in the snow|is just meat, Antonio. Food.
{83483}{83619}I won't do it. I'd rather die.|I fear God's judgement if I do that.
{83633}{83663}He put us here.
{83667}{83745}Maybe he did, to see what we'd do,
{83773}{83822}to see if we'd remain civilised.
{83835}{83904}- God doesn't care if...|- How do you know?
{83908}{83984}Let Tintin speak.|He never says anything.
{83989}{84105}I always thought God wants us|to reason, struggle to live.
{84109}{84167}- At any price?|- No.
{84171}{84229}We shouldn't|murder innocents to live.
{84232}{84361}What will happen to our innocence|if we survive as cannibals?
{84398}{84478}- I can't do it.|- I'm with you.
{84482}{84585}I don't think I could.|How could we go back to our families?
{84610}{84691}You could go back alive.|I think they'd prefer that.
{84704}{84846}Are you ready to go out and cut flesh|from a human body and eat it?
{85089}{85143}None of us can decide|a thing like this.
{85147}{85252}- We're alone here.|- We could be on the moon.
{85290}{85398}There must've been situations|like this before, the first people.
{85420}{85483}I don't know.
{85487}{85578}There's nothing|left for us to do but pray.
{85812}{85853}So?
{85888}{85984}They're going to pray.|They'll decide in the morning.
{86099}{86222}What have we done that God now asks|us to eat our dead friends' bodies?
{86227}{86371}- What would they have thought?|- I don't know.
{86432}{86526}- I can't sleep.|- Don't waste the battery.
{86529}{86611}I know that if I died,
{86615}{86770}if my dead body could help you|stay alive, I'd want you to use it.
{86858}{86979}If I do die and you don't eat me,|I'll come back and kick your ass!
{87024}{87065}That's a good one.
{87186}{87253}Take my hand and pledge with me.
{87257}{87322}Whoever dies, agrees...
{87325}{87383}use my body as food.
{87450}{87518}- All right.|- I pledge...
{87522}{87589}- I agree.|- Me, too.
{87651}{87718}I'm in...
{87721}{87752}Carlitos?
{87781}{87826}I'm thinking.
{87962}{88008}Antonio?
{88189}{88230}Yeah.
{88299}{88405}Can you just promise, if you eat me,
{88409}{88466}that you clean your plates?
{88611}{88661}God bless you all.
{88941}{89011}- Pablo, Pablo.|- Yeah?
{89015}{89063}- How's your stomach?|- Fine.
{89067}{89112}Let me see.
{89205}{89262}- Looks great.|- Told you.
{89266}{89314}You should be dead.
{89332}{89379}So what do you think, Tintin?
{89383}{89454}I think we should eat.
{89557}{89638}If we do this,|we'll never be the same again.
{89641}{89741}It's like communion.|From their death, we live.
{89745}{89782}People will understand.
{89902}{89959}This should be good for the cutting.
{90188}{90247}All right. Give me that.
{91675}{91709}It's very difficult to cut.
{91714}{91818}The meat's almost frozen.|I'm going to eat this piece.
{92689}{92745}Somebody take this.
{94097}{94195}Someone take this and eat it.|Come on!
{94276}{94412}I tell you, if I have meat in my belly,|I intend to get something done.
{94761}{94797}Where were you?
{94892}{94941}You didn't take from my sister?
{94946}{95072}No. It wasn't a woman.|I don't know who it was.
{95076}{95126}How are the others eating?
{95153}{95220}- One by one.|- Good.
{95272}{95327}I'll do what I can,|while I'm strong.
{95331}{95411}When I'm not, it's your turn.
{95415}{95470}God, she was so beautiful.
{96060}{96126}Son of a bitch! They went without me?
{96131}{96199}You can't go till you eat.|They're looking for the tail.
{96204}{96301}With the batteries|you can work the transmitter!
{97123}{97198}Can't see them any more.
{97863}{97906}Look at that!
{98086}{98199}Tonight, we pray for the climbers,|that they come back to us.
{98222}{98287}So you pray too, Fito.
{98291}{98347}I told you, I'm an agnostic.
{98550}{98629}Hail Mary, full of grace,|the Lord is with Thee.
{98632}{98729}Blessed art thou amongst women,|and blessed is the fruit of thy womb...
{99280}{99308}Eat this.
{99330}{99388}Eat it!
{99488}{99523}You think they're OK?
{99590}{99662}No. They way they were dressed...
{99707}{99800}Had to be 35, 40 below last night.
{99803}{99846}They're dead.
{100473}{100560}- It's the sun.|- No, we're dreaming.
{100596}{100639}What...?
{100644}{100676}What?
{100680}{100739}What?
{100743}{100832}It's the sun. Thank God!
{101203}{101278}Look! It's a seat from the plane!
{101410}{101460}It's heavy. Help me!
{101468}{101524}Ready? Go!
{101719}{101769}He must've burned.
{101883}{101911}What are you doing?
{101916}{102039}I'm taking his wallet|and whatever he has for his mother.
{102043}{102073}Hey!
{102106}{102157}There's more over here.
{102503}{102608}This accounts for those that are|still missing. Altogether three.
{102612}{102707}- My feet are starting to freeze.|- We should go back.
{102712}{102776}Do you want to try something?
{103171}{103269}Why does it smell so bad|even after you clean it?
{103273}{103318}It's the infection.
{103355}{103408}I'll clean it again tonight.
{103412}{103536}Don't look so downhearted, Roberto.|Take a lesson from Alberto.
{103540}{103590}Nothing stops him.
{103595}{103720}I have abandoned the Church of Rome|in favour of Utopia.
{103725}{103779}Good for you, Alberto.
{103783}{103919}And for my part, my name is|Federico Aranda and I will return.
{104089}{104163}How is Federico?
{104167}{104269}He has gangrene, I think.|I know Alberto does.
{104273}{104321}Canessa! Canessa!
{104342}{104420}Look at this! Look at this!
{104425}{104454}Watch out!
{104459}{104487}They're flying!
{104536}{104584}Watch out!
{104589}{104671}Roberto! Rafael!
{104860}{104946}They didn't die, Roberto.|Anything is possible.
{105048}{105195}There was a piece of the wing.|The tail must be up there somewhere.
{105199}{105291}Here's the plan.|We pick a team to go after the tail.
{105295}{105351}- I'll go.|- Me, too.
{105355}{105417}We give the team the biggest|rations and warmest clothes.
{105421}{105587}Then in a week, we go find|the batteries and start the transmitter.
{105612}{105698}It gets cold up there.|I couldn't do it again.
{105709}{105749}Me neither.
{105814}{105846}I need more money.
{105888}{105930}Here.
{106029}{106092}I wish we could have|a fire every night,
{106096}{106143}and that someone would go for pizza.
{106198}{106376}- I'll pay if you go.|- No, I insist. I'll pay, you go.
{106792}{106951}I feel God is taking care of us.|Don't you feel it? A sense of fate?
{107039}{107101}I feel a sense of fate.
{107189}{107240}Hi.
{107281}{107350}I wanted you all to know...
{107354}{107478}if I die, you have my permission...
{107482}{107536}You can eat me.
{107918}{107970}If anybody could hear this!
{108039}{108078}Sit down, Antonio.
{108187}{108307}Coche, it's too bad|you didn't play the cello!
{108635}{108707}- Javier.|- What?
{108721}{108770}I've decided something.
{108781}{108846}What's that, sweetie?
{108850}{108908}I want to have another baby.
{108911}{109046}This experience... It's made me feel|the miracle of life so deeply.
{109057}{109180}It's not that, my dear.|It's just that you're not eating.
{109185}{109246}If you don't eat, how will you live?
{109389}{109452}You're right.
{109457}{109493}You're right.
{109561}{109651}I'll eat some. I'll do it.
{109705}{109734}Tomorrow.
{109763}{109817}I'll eat tomorrow...
{109904}{109945}God bless you.
{112264}{112351}- Where is everyone?|- I don't know.
{112433}{112488}Shine the light over here.
{112540}{112597}Avalanche!
{112991}{113028}I can't see!
{113151}{113258}- You all right? Who is it?|- Zerbino.
{113458}{113518}- Help!|- Antonio.
{113590}{113656}Antonio?
{113723}{113790}Here's somebody!|Here's somebody!
{113794}{113848}Go, go, go!
{114014}{114050}Pablo?
{114501}{114605}Hold on! I'll get to you. Lilliana!
{114609}{114689}Help me! For God's sake,|help me. My wife!
{115031}{115118}Please don't take her from me now!
{115221}{115254}He's breathing. Nando!
{115285}{115383}- Keep digging. Please, Nando!|- Get him out!
{115443}{115504}Pull! Pull him out!
{115831}{115926}Eight are dead.|Eight of us are dead.
{117253}{117345}We can't go out. There's a blizzard.
{117385}{117433}Let me see.
{117728}{117759}Roberto.
{117809}{117899}Listen, today is Rafael's birthday.
{117953}{118048}- So?|- We've got to observe his birthday.
{118179}{118254}Happy birthday to you
{118307}{118427}Happy birthday, dear Rafael
{118440}{118538}Happy birthday to you
{118572}{118617}Make a wish.
{118645}{118693}A wish?
{118801}{118858}I just wish this was over.
{119093}{119161}- It's still snowing.|- It's a blizzard.
{119259}{119336}You're not gonna believe this.
{119340}{119370}What?
{119374}{119425}Today is my birthday.
{119463}{119589}Happy birthday, dear Carlitos
{119593}{119654}I love you all so much.
{119658}{119761}Happy birthday to you
{119803}{119860}And my wish... my wish...
{120115}{120210}Tonight, we say the rosary|for the living and for life itself.
{120230}{120383}That we have survived a plane crash,|starvation and an avalanche...
{120405}{120542}And tonight, Fito, no more kidding.|You've got to pray with us.
{120585}{120690}I'm not saying no rosary, Carlitos.|I'm an agnostic.
{120769}{120801}What's that?
{120821}{120865}Another avalanche!
{120959}{121013}Hail Mary, full of grace,|the Lord is with Thee.
{121017}{121058}Blessed art thou amongst women|and blessed is the fruit of thy womb...
{121878}{121949}Alberto. Alberto.
{122077}{122122}Light.
{122296}{122390}Canessa. Zerbino.
{122394}{122449}Good morning, Carlitos.
{122461}{122527}Good morning, my friends.|Do you know what today is?
{122582}{122618}No. What?
{122629}{122700}Today is my father's birthday.
{122704}{122836}My father is an artist,|a painter and a bit of a madman.
{122860}{122990}Now in my heart, with the rise of|this sun, I do believe I'll see him again.
{122994}{123028}Do you feel it?
{123049}{123093}What?
{123122}{123161}God.
{123165}{123237}God is everywhere today.
{124409}{124457}Over here! I'm here!
{125349}{125441}This is where the dead were.|Gone under the snow now.
{125445}{125540}It's about the closest|they'll get to a burial.
{125565}{125637}- I'm worried about Eduardo.|- Why?
{125641}{125701}He's losing his spirit.
{126407}{126504}- When are we going?|- Fifteenth.
{126509}{126619}- The fifteenth passed by.|- The fifteenth of next month.
{126652}{126705}That's too long.
{126719}{126834}Winter's ending, nights'll|get shorter. We'll have a chance.
{127012}{127095}Alberto.
{127099}{127161}Why are you crying?
{127165}{127222}Because I am so close to God.
{127988}{128027}So beautiful.
{128397}{128440}Wake up, please.
{128496}{128577}Wake up, everyone.
{128650}{128747}My name is Federico Aranda,|and I have to tell you
{128751}{128878}that Alberto Antuna,|a brave boy, is dead.
{128933}{129003}He was 21 years old.
{129159}{129211}Eternal rest grant unto them, O Lord.
{129215}{129371}Let perpetual light shine upon them.|May they rest in peace. Amen.
{129872}{129944}- This should be enough.|- Wait a few more days.
{129949}{130048}- Why?|- It'll be warmer.
{130053}{130176}I waited. On the 15th and 16th,|you said the weather was no good.
{130180}{130344}I've been waiting on you for four|weeks. Put your pack on, this is it.
{130429}{130459}All right.
{130512}{130572}How are you doing, Federico?
{130576}{130669}Very well, Nando.|Good luck on your journey.
{130687}{130781}Thank you.|They tell me you won't eat, Javier.
{130942}{130998}It's up to you|if you want to survive.
{131045}{131084}Perhaps...
{131131}{131243}Forget your wife! Forget her!|Remember your living children!
{131385}{131423}Will you eat?
{131486}{131530}I'll eat.
{131613}{131651}Good.
{131725}{131801}Stay well, Federico. Pray for me.
{131817}{131854}I will.
{131893}{131938}We'll find the tail|and the batteries.
{131942}{132027}- And if you don't?|- We keep going.
{132031}{132104}- Where? Through the mountains?|- We'll find the tail.
{132109}{132221}- Got the radio out?|- Just about. There's a lot of wires.
{132225}{132375}- We'll figure it out.|- All right, Eduardo, see these?
{132379}{132485}- Little shoes.|- Little red shoes. Take this one.
{132513}{132653}When these are a pair again,|you're going to be going home. All right?
{132716}{132745}OK.
{132770}{132836}OK.
{132841}{132902}All right. Let's do it!
{133734}{133796}Where'd you learn about transmitters?
{133800}{133919}I didn't. I helped my cousins|put together their stereos.
{133923}{134001}- Now I'm the radio man.|- Our lives depend on this.
{134005}{134104}Who asked you? Don't upset me!|I'm emotional as it is.
{134109}{134211}- Come on. Leave him alone.|- Let's go.
{134388}{134493}Wait till you see...|You're not gonna believe it!
{134787}{134828}Chocolate!
{135284}{135313}Sweaters!
{135337}{135373}Clean underwear!
{135413}{135481}A comic book I haven't read!
{135521}{135558}Toothpaste!
{135605}{135644}Delicious!
{135945}{136009}This is a pretty good story.
{136066}{136128}Maybe we should just keep walking|tomorrow.
{136133}{136260}What? We take the batteries back|and send an SOS. That's it.
{136264}{136328}All this time,|the tail was three hours away.
{136333}{136385}Maybe we should just walk to Chile.
{136421}{136532}What? You're talking shit. We don't|have the equipment. We would die.
{136580}{136670}No, we bring the batteries back|and transmit SOS. That's it.
{136697}{136739}One, two, three...
{137325}{137411}That isn't going to work.|Maybe we should walk...
{137430}{137579}I'm not killing myself walking|into the mountains. It's a stupid...
{137583}{137626}All right.
{137657}{137729}This is what we'll do.
{137756}{137845}- We'll bring the radio here.|- We can't hook up a radio.
{137895}{137972}- We'll bring Roy.|- I don't want to go.
{137977}{138036}- We know nothing about radios.|- I don't either!
{138053}{138145}I don't know what these wires are!|I only built a stereo!
{138158}{138246}- We had a booklet.|- You're going!
{138293}{138352}You take it. You're smarter than me!
{138356}{138456}I don't want to go up in the snow.|I don't want to!
{138469}{138585}How much further is it?|We've been walking a long time!
{138589}{138689}I don't have any strength, you know?|I feel sick and weak.
{138693}{138769}- I wish he'd shut up.|- This was your idea.
{138867}{138896}- Careful!|- Sorry.
{138901}{138952}You'll burn something out.|Give me that.
{138957}{139026}It'll be dark soon.
{139030}{139142}I'm going to wrap|this round my legs. I want to be warm.
{139150}{139188}- Damn it!|- That was you.
{139193}{139289}Give that up.|We'll make a fire.
{139293}{139383}Tintin, let's make a fire.
{139443}{139518}This stuff worked good.
{139522}{139596}I feel snug as a bug.
{139624}{139695}- What should we do?|- Fix the radio.
{139699}{139752}- If we can't?|- It won't work.
{139756}{139831}- When it does, it'll be no thanks to you!|- I never said...
{139835}{139952}If it doesn't work,|what should we do? Tintin?
{139956}{140026}I don't know.|Whatever you two decide.
{140046}{140076}Mister Switzerland!
{140116}{140214}- If the radio doesn't work, we...|- I'm not climbing those mountains!
{140218}{140285}Then I'll go without you.
{140314}{140379}You'll die. You'll freeze to death.
{140399}{140520}No, I won't. There's enough of this|stuff here to make a sleeping bag.
{140889}{140964}Nando. Nando.
{140999}{141069}Look at this! Look.
{141085}{141132}Oh, wow!
{141186}{141253}Look at that cake.
{141559}{141632}Are we going the right way?
{141685}{141754}I think so.
{142100}{142148}- Come on!|- I can't!
{142172}{142212}You know you can!
{142217}{142246}Leave me!
{142250}{142338}We must go on. We get|caught in this after dark, we're dead.
{142350}{142400}- Go ahead!|- What about Roy?
{142405}{142493}You go on. I'll get Roy to the plane!
{142518}{142585}- I told you winter wasn't over!|- Leave me!
{142589}{142648}- Come on!|- I can't walk!
{142652}{142735}I can't carry you.|You'll kill us both!
{142795}{142833}I can't!
{142837}{142930}What do you mean you can't?|You piece of shit!
{142934}{143061}You can't tell me you can't do it!|Get up and walk ten steps.
{143065}{143148}- Get up and walk!|- All right!
{143456}{143500}It's them!
{143671}{143724}- Did the radio work?|- No.
{143728}{143799}- Where's Nando?|- I don't know.
{144168}{144207}Nando!
{144266}{144332}Come on! Come on!
{144909}{144981}- Carlitos, here!|- Thanks.
{145157}{145257}Didn't you see him? Federico's dead!
{146157}{146293}- No good.|- What do you mean no good?
{146357}{146415}Try to sleep.
{146609}{146704}- He's bad.|- What's the matter with him?
{146708}{146807}Are you surprised?|How long can people live like this?
{147737}{147803}Carlitos says|the sleeping bag's ready.
{147807}{147863}- No.|- Yes. It's time to go.
{147867}{147915}We almost died in that storm.
{147919}{147989}Winter's not over! Listen to me.
{147993}{148101}You've got the will, but I have the brains.|I say wait till the bag's ready.
{148105}{148175}- The bag is ready!|- It's not!
{148179}{148254}No, it's not ready.
{148444}{148504}Rafael's dead.
{148692}{148853}It's time to go, Roberto. It's time.|Before we turn into animals.
{149032}{149072}All right.
{149588}{149635}Nando.
{149659}{149705}I still got the shoe!
{149773}{149821}I still got mine.
{149941}{150060}- God be with you. You'll be OK.|- Thanks.
{150288}{150400}- Wait!|- Carlitos, let them go.
{150405}{150528}I forgot to say I had a dream last night,|a tremendous premonition.
{150533}{150661}I saw green fields and flowers.|I could smell the grass.
{150665}{150727}Your expedition will succeed.
{150997}{151057}Don't forget the pizza!
{152601}{152643}Here you go.
{153183}{153310}That looks like a good place to camp,|right up there.
{154307}{154370}I think this is the top.
{155373}{155456}- Maybe this leads somewhere.|- Be careful.
{155703}{155759}You'll fall too!
{155769}{155822}Hang on! Give me the strap!
{155847}{155899}I got you. Hold on!
{155955}{156001}Hold on!
{156005}{156051}You got me?
{156161}{156219}Hold on! I got you.
{156289}{156347}Hurry!
{156351}{156382}- You got me?|- Yes.
{156386}{156456}- Hurry up!|- Hang on!
{156577}{156633}Now get me up!
{157273}{157389}Grab hold of me.|Pull yourself! Go over me!
{157601}{157747}So what do you think?|You want to try the other way?
{158345}{158473}- You ready, Roberto?|- You see that line?
{158508}{158559}- That's a road.|- I can't see anything.
{158563}{158597}Do you see it, Tintin?
{158632}{158696}I see a line.|I don't know if it's a road.
{158701}{158821}- I think we should go back.|- Go back?!
{158825}{158888}Yeah. This mountain's too high.
{158893}{158999}- What do we do if we go back?|- Go to the road.
{159031}{159196}- It might be a road, it might not.|- I've the best eyes. That's a road.
{159200}{159235}I'm going back.
{159315}{159344}I'm going on.
{159433}{159525}- What are you going to do, Tintin?|- I don't know.
{159529}{159665}How about this? We leave the stuff|with you, we go to the top and see.
{159669}{159716}Will you wait for us, Roberto?
{159756}{159796}All right.
{159860}{159908}Then I'm going back.
{160673}{160747}I'm going to see a valley, a river.
{160751}{160839}I'm going to see green trees|and hills.
{161396}{161458}Tintin! Tintin!
{161477}{161559}Get Canessa.|Tell him it's going to be all right.
{161577}{161674}Tell him to come up|and see for himself.
{161685}{161780}Canessa! Canessa!
{161785}{161844}Nando's at the top.
{161892}{161932}Did you get there?
{161972}{162035}No, but he says it's marvellous.
{162140}{162188}I have to rest.
{162557}{162607}Nando?
{163008}{163114}Mountains! Nothing but mountains.
{163206}{163252}We've had it!
{163312}{163378}We've completely had it!
{163405}{163449}No, we haven't.
{163461}{163544}Between these mountains|somewhere, there's a green valley.
{163557}{163677}See those mountains?|There's no snow on them.
{163681}{163812}They must be 50 miles away.|You think you can walk 50 miles?
{163830}{163876}If we have to, we will.
{163880}{163922}- I can't.|- You can.
{163942}{163987}I can't.
{164034}{164111}I'm not as strong as you.
{164181}{164302}You know what it is that we've lived|this long, the way we have? 70 days?
{164306}{164389}That we climbed up here?|Know what it is?
{164393}{164430}It's impossible.
{164434}{164560}- It's impossible and we did it.|- I know.
{164642}{164787}I'm proud to be a man|on a day like this. Alive!
{164791}{164862}That I lived to see it,
{164866}{164984}and see it|in such a place, take it in!
{165014}{165073}I love you, man! Look!
{165138}{165180}It's magnificent.
{165231}{165282}It's God.
{165384}{165448}It'll carry us over every stone.
{165451}{165529}I swear! I swear to you.
{165785}{165927}We'll get Tintin. We'll send him back|to the plane and take his extra food.
{165931}{166023}You see? You see|where the sun's going to set?
{166027}{166080}That way's west.
{166084}{166159}And to the west are the green|valleys of Chile.
{166163}{166222}We're gonna die, you know?
{166277}{166432}Maybe. But if we die,|we're gonna die walking.
{166924}{166960}Good luck!
{171889}{171949}We're going home!
{172682}{172735}And so we were saved.
{172757}{172869}Nando and Canessa breached|the Andes and we were saved.
{173002}{173104}Later, a group went back|and buried the bodies.
{173109}{173182}They built a rough stone altar|by the grave,
{173186}{173277}and over it|they placed an iron cross.
{173365}{173437}There's nothing more I can tell you.
{173474}{173564}We were brought together|by a grand experience.
