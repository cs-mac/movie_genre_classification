00:00:07.51,00:00:10.92
Hello. I'm William Friedkin,[br]director of "The Exorcist."

00:00:11.55,00:00:14.54
"The Exorcist" is a film[br]about the mystery of faith.

00:00:15.22,00:00:19.16
And I think the fact that it has endured[br]for more than 25 years now...

00:00:19.26,00:00:23.89
...is due, in large part, to what it leaves[br]you with after you've seen the film.

00:00:24.83,00:00:27.03
It starts with a brilliant screenplay...

00:00:27.10,00:00:30.16
...from an equally powerful novel[br]by William Peter Blatty.

00:00:30.87,00:00:35.57
And it's a story that can, perhaps,[br]make you question your own value system.

00:00:36.04,00:00:37.67
Even your own sanity.

00:00:37.98,00:00:40.71
Because it strongly and realistically...

00:00:40.98,00:00:44.64
...tries to make the case for spiritual forces[br]in the universe.

00:00:45.05,00:00:46.88
Both good and evil.

00:00:47.99,00:00:50.01
But what you may not be aware of...

00:00:50.09,00:00:53.29
...is the fact that "The Exorcist"[br]is based on a true story.

00:00:53.63,00:00:57.65
It took place in Silver Spring, Maryland,[br]in 1949...

00:00:57.73,00:01:00.67
...and was widely reported[br]by the American press.

00:01:00.93,00:01:03.90
When I saw the files[br]at Georgetown University...

00:01:04.00,00:01:06.27
...pertaining to the actual case...

00:01:06.51,00:01:10.17
...I knew that this was going to be,[br]or needed to be...

00:01:10.31,00:01:13.01
...something more[br]than just another horror film.

00:01:13.35,00:01:15.78
This had to be a realistic film...

00:01:16.12,00:01:18.14
...about inexplicable events.

00:01:19.92,00:01:23.98
I've always thought that a film should,[br]first of all, be an emotional experience.

00:01:24.06,00:01:27.42
It should make you laugh,[br]or cry, or be scared.

00:01:27.86,00:01:30.83
But it should also inspire[br]and provoke you...

00:01:31.03,00:01:32.69
...and make you reflect.

00:01:33.43,00:01:35.26
Over the years, I think that...

00:01:35.34,00:01:39.17
...most people take out of "The Exorcist"[br]what they bring to it.

00:01:39.97,00:01:43.34
If you believe that the world is[br]a dark and evil place...

00:01:43.61,00:01:46.44
...then "The Exorcist" will reinforce that.

00:01:46.78,00:01:49.91
But if you believe that there is[br]a force for good...

00:01:50.08,00:01:53.61
...that combats and, eventually,[br]triumphs over evil...

00:01:54.29,00:01:58.35
...then you'll be taking out of the film[br]what we tried to put into it.

00:01:59.26,00:02:03.66
In any case, turn down the lights,[br]turn up the sound...

00:02:04.13,00:02:08.69
...and enjoy the digitally[br]re-mastered version of "The Exorcist."

00:14:08.89,00:14:10.22
I sure do love you.

00:14:12.56,00:14:14.49
Good morning, Mrs. MacNeil.

00:14:14.56,00:14:16.96
-How are you today?[br]-Fine, thank you.

00:14:18.10,00:14:19.89
It's okay, I've got it. Thanks.

00:14:20.93,00:14:23.23
-Good morning, Madam.[br]-Good morning, Karl.

00:14:23.97,00:14:27.30
Oh, Karl, we've got rats in the attic.[br]You'd better get some traps.

00:14:27.71,00:14:28.70
Rats?

00:14:29.48,00:14:30.70
I'm afraid so.

00:14:31.21,00:14:32.61
But the attic is clean.

00:14:32.85,00:14:34.84
All right, then, we've got clean rats.

00:14:35.48,00:14:37.45
-No rats.[br]-I just heard them, Karl.

00:14:38.22,00:14:39.38
Maybe prowlers.

00:14:39.62,00:14:42.68
Yeah, or maybe rats.[br]Now, will you just get the traps?

00:14:43.02,00:14:44.01
Yes, I go now.

00:14:44.12,00:14:46.96
-Don't go now. The stores aren't open yet.[br]-I'll go see.

00:14:47.03,00:14:48.25
They're closed!

00:14:48.83,00:14:52.99
In the group over here,[br]I need a couple of priests, a nun....

00:14:55.64,00:14:57.80
That's exactly what we want.

00:15:03.14,00:15:07.51
Is this scene really essential? Would you[br]just consider if we can do without it?

00:15:07.61,00:15:10.28
Look at this damn thing.[br]It just doesn't make sense.

00:15:10.38,00:15:11.44
It's perfectly plain.

00:15:11.52,00:15:14.71
You're a teacher of the college.[br]You don't want the building torn down.

00:15:14.79,00:15:17.72
-I can read, for Christ's sake![br]-Well, what's wrong?

00:15:17.89,00:15:20.19
Well, why are they tearing[br]the building down?

00:15:20.29,00:15:23.23
Shall we summon the writer?[br]He's in Paris, I believe.

00:15:23.36,00:15:24.09
Hiding?

00:15:24.16,00:15:25.15
Fucking.

00:15:27.97,00:15:30.23
Scene 39: Hotel. Take four.

00:15:30.37,00:15:32.80
All right. Hustle back on in.

00:15:36.54,00:15:38.41
Is this your campus?

00:15:39.45,00:15:42.41
Let's get the Defense Department[br]off this campus!

00:15:44.78,00:15:46.45
It's our school!

00:15:46.59,00:15:48.38
They have no right!

00:15:53.46,00:15:55.79
I've seen enough killing in my life!

00:15:56.23,00:15:58.36
There's no reason for it anymore!

00:16:00.73,00:16:01.89
Wait a minute!

00:16:05.04,00:16:07.90
We're all concerned with human rights,[br]for God's sake...

00:16:08.07,00:16:11.53
...but the kids who want[br]to get an education have a right, too!

00:16:16.42,00:16:19.85
Don't you understand? It's against[br]your own principle, for God's sake!

00:16:23.62,00:16:26.96
You can't accomplish anything[br]by shutting kids off from their....

00:16:34.73,00:16:38.97
If you want to effect any change,[br]you have to do it within the system.

00:16:41.04,00:16:43.17
Okay, cut! That's a wrap.

00:17:00.56,00:17:02.15
I think I'll walk home tonight, Mike.

00:17:02.23,00:17:04.56
Here, take that and drop it by my house.

00:17:04.86,00:17:06.42
Good night, Tom.

00:17:44.24,00:17:47.17
There's not a day in my life[br]that I don't feel like a fraud.

00:17:47.51,00:17:50.34
I mean, priests, doctors, lawyers.[br]I've talked to them all.

00:17:50.51,00:17:52.34
I don't know anyone who hasn't felt that.

00:17:58.78,00:17:59.81
Hello?

00:18:00.05,00:18:01.11
In here.

00:18:03.12,00:18:05.61
-Hi, how did your day go?[br]-Not too bad.

00:18:05.83,00:18:08.95
It was kind of like the Walt Disney version[br]of the "Ho Chi Minh Story".

00:18:09.03,00:18:12.46
Other than that, it was terrific.[br]What have we got, anything exciting here?

00:18:14.17,00:18:15.66
Also, you got an invitation.

00:18:15.87,00:18:17.06
What's this?

00:18:17.20,00:18:18.57
Dinner at the White House.

00:18:18.64,00:18:20.90
You're kidding me![br]What is it, a big party or something?

00:18:20.97,00:18:22.30
I think it's five or six people.

00:18:22.91,00:18:25.24
Thursday, huh? All right.

00:18:25.41,00:18:26.57
Hi, Mom.

00:18:26.65,00:18:28.08
What did you do today?

00:18:28.51,00:18:30.51
-Stuff.[br]-What does that mean, "stuff"?

00:18:32.32,00:18:34.95
Me and Sharon played a game[br]in the backyard.

00:18:35.19,00:18:37.31
And we had a picnic down by the river.

00:18:38.89,00:18:43.56
Mom, you should have seen it! This man[br]came along on this beautiful gray horse.

00:18:43.70,00:18:45.13
Really? What kind?

00:18:45.23,00:18:46.72
Was it a mare, a gelding?

00:18:47.60,00:18:49.16
I think it was a gelding.

00:18:49.74,00:18:50.67
It was gray.

00:18:50.74,00:18:55.17
Oh, it was so beautiful. The guy let me[br]ride it all around and everything.

00:18:55.51,00:18:57.41
She rode it for about half an hour.

00:18:58.41,00:19:02.11
I loved it! Oh, Mom, can't we get a horse?

00:19:02.21,00:19:05.24
-Not while we're in Washington, honey.[br]-Why not, Mom?

00:19:05.69,00:19:07.48
We'll see when we get home, okay?

00:19:07.59,00:19:08.61
When could I have one?

00:19:08.69,00:19:10.35
We'll see, Regan. We'll see.

00:19:10.86,00:19:13.59
Listen, on the party invitations[br]I want to write a personal--

00:19:13.79,00:19:16.19
Regan, don't! Come back!

00:19:21.20,00:19:22.69
All right, give it up. Give it up!

00:19:22.77,00:19:23.74
No!

00:19:25.94,00:19:27.37
You'll be sorry!

00:19:58.64,00:19:59.73
Father?

00:19:59.81,00:20:01.57
Could you help an old altar boy?

00:20:02.88,00:20:03.86
I'm a Catholic.

00:21:30.56,00:21:31.59
Mama?

00:21:55.89,00:21:58.29
-I'm so glad to see you.[br]-You look good.

00:21:58.36,00:21:59.65
I'm all right.

00:22:00.26,00:22:02.92
-How's your leg?[br]-How about you? You are all right?

00:22:03.33,00:22:04.39
Mama, I'm fine.

00:22:09.34,00:22:10.39
Your Uncle John...

00:22:10.47,00:22:12.53
...passed by to visit me.

00:22:12.61,00:22:13.63
Really, when?

00:22:13.81,00:22:14.90
Last month.

00:22:19.28,00:22:21.25
-Is that too tight?[br]-No.

00:22:22.78,00:22:26.74
You have to stay off it. You can't go[br]up and down the stairs. Give it a rest.

00:22:27.22,00:22:28.38
Okay.

00:22:38.83,00:22:42.53
Mama, I could take you somewhere where[br]you'd be safe. You wouldn't be alone.

00:22:42.60,00:22:43.83
There would be people around.

00:22:43.90,00:22:46.46
You wouldn't be sitting here[br]listening to the radio.

00:22:51.21,00:22:52.40
You understand me?

00:22:52.65,00:22:56.84
This is my house[br]and I'm not going no place.

00:23:10.33,00:23:12.59
Dimmie, you worry for something?

00:23:12.70,00:23:14.50
-No, Mama.[br]-You are not happy?

00:23:14.67,00:23:16.36
Tell me, what is the matter?

00:23:16.67,00:23:19.00
Mama, I'm all right. I'm fine. Really, I am.

00:23:54.04,00:23:55.23
Here it comes.

00:23:55.87,00:23:56.90
There!

00:23:59.81,00:24:01.51
-Oh, look at that![br]-Do you like it?

00:24:01.58,00:24:03.41
Oh, isn't that funny!

00:24:05.05,00:24:07.95
I better put him over here to dry, though.[br]He's still wet.

00:24:13.49,00:24:15.08
Hey, where did this come from?

00:24:17.16,00:24:18.69
-I found it.[br]-Where?

00:24:20.83,00:24:21.99
In the closet.

00:24:24.97,00:24:26.63
Have you been playing with it?

00:24:26.71,00:24:28.43
-Yep.[br]-Do you know how?

00:24:28.84,00:24:30.14
I'll show you.

00:24:34.58,00:24:36.21
Wait a minute. You need two.

00:24:36.58,00:24:39.42
No, you don't. I do it all the time.

00:24:40.19,00:24:41.88
Well, let's both play.

00:24:44.92,00:24:46.82
You really don't want me to play, huh?

00:24:46.89,00:24:49.45
No, I do! Captain Howdy said no.

00:24:50.20,00:24:52.25
-Captain who?[br]-Captain Howdy.

00:24:53.33,00:24:54.56
Who's Captain Howdy?

00:24:55.00,00:24:57.80
You know. I make the questions[br]and he does the answers.

00:24:59.44,00:25:02.24
-Captain Howdy. I see.[br]-He's nice.

00:25:03.34,00:25:04.83
I'll bet he is.

00:25:04.91,00:25:06.17
Here, I'll show you.

00:25:07.91,00:25:10.88
Captain Howdy,[br]do you think my Mom is pretty?

00:25:16.06,00:25:18.42
Captain Howdy, that isn't very nice.

00:25:18.49,00:25:20.65
-Maybe he's sleeping.[br]-You think?

00:25:23.26,00:25:25.32
Why are you reading that stuff?

00:25:25.66,00:25:26.82
Because I like it.

00:25:27.07,00:25:28.80
It's not even a good picture of you.

00:25:30.20,00:25:32.64
-You look so mature.[br]-I wouldn't talk!

00:25:32.94,00:25:34.03
You wouldn't talk?

00:25:35.77,00:25:37.90
Well, I didn't have my makeup man there.

00:25:38.64,00:25:40.64
Let me take an eyelash off your face.

00:25:41.45,00:25:42.78
No, I didn't get it.

00:25:44.22,00:25:48.41
What are we going to do on your birthday?[br]isn't it nice it's on Sunday this year?

00:25:48.89,00:25:50.98
No work? What can we do?

00:25:51.22,00:25:52.28
I don't know.

00:25:52.36,00:25:54.79
What would you like to do? Got any ideas?

00:25:57.86,00:25:59.30
Let me think....

00:26:00.50,00:26:03.56
You know, we never finished seeing[br]all the sights in Washington.

00:26:03.64,00:26:06.04
We didn't get to the Lee Mansion,[br]lots of stuff.

00:26:06.11,00:26:08.10
Shall we do that? Go sightseeing...

00:26:08.64,00:26:11.27
-...if it's a nice day?[br]-Yeah, let's do that.

00:26:12.41,00:26:16.54
And tomorrow night,[br]I'll take you to a movie, okay?

00:26:17.75,00:26:19.01
Oh, I love you!

00:26:19.79,00:26:21.31
I love you, Rags.

00:26:24.76,00:26:26.25
We'll have a good day, huh?

00:26:26.39,00:26:28.55
You can bring Mr. Dennings, if you like.

00:26:29.33,00:26:30.99
Mr. Dennings?

00:26:31.06,00:26:32.59
Well, you know, it's okay.

00:26:33.27,00:26:34.60
Thank you very much...

00:26:34.67,00:26:37.57
...but why would I want to bring Burke[br]on your birthday?

00:26:37.64,00:26:38.86
Well, you like him.

00:26:39.67,00:26:43.23
Yeah, I like him. Don't you like him?[br]What's going on? What is this?

00:26:43.58,00:26:45.48
You're going to marry him, aren't you?

00:26:46.41,00:26:49.01
You've got to be kidding![br]Me marry Burke Dennings?

00:26:49.21,00:26:51.44
Don't be silly. Of course not.

00:26:51.62,00:26:53.61
Where did you ever get an idea like that?

00:26:53.69,00:26:55.08
But you like him.

00:26:55.99,00:26:59.58
Of course, I like him. I like pizzas too,[br]but I'm not going to marry one.

00:26:59.66,00:27:01.39
You don't like him like Daddy?

00:27:03.13,00:27:04.99
Regan, I love your Daddy.

00:27:05.83,00:27:07.86
I'll always love your Daddy, honey.

00:27:09.23,00:27:11.46
Burke just comes around here a lot[br]because...

00:27:13.31,00:27:15.57
...well, he's lonely.[br]He don't got nothing to do!

00:27:15.74,00:27:18.40
Well, I heard differently.

00:27:19.01,00:27:21.07
Oh, you did? What did you hear?

00:27:21.51,00:27:24.31
I don't know. I just thought.

00:27:24.42,00:27:26.04
Well, you didn't think so good.

00:27:26.12,00:27:27.59
How do you know?

00:27:28.52,00:27:31.39
Because Burke and I are just friends.[br]Okay? Really.

00:27:33.03,00:27:34.36
Are you ready for sleep?

00:27:38.36,00:27:39.83
Good night, honey.

00:28:00.45,00:28:01.92
It's my mother, Tom.

00:28:02.99,00:28:05.55
She's alone and I never[br]should have left her.

00:28:07.16,00:28:10.03
At least in New York, I'd been near.[br]I'd been close to her.

00:28:10.30,00:28:12.32
I could see about a transfer, Damien.

00:28:14.73,00:28:18.90
I need reassignment, Tom. I want out[br]of this job. It's wrong, it's no good.

00:28:19.50,00:28:20.97
You're the best we've got.

00:28:22.57,00:28:23.91
Am I really?

00:28:26.85,00:28:29.14
It's more than psychiatry,[br]and you know that, Tom.

00:28:29.21,00:28:31.77
Some of their problems[br]come down to their faith...

00:28:32.18,00:28:35.95
...their vocation, the meaning of their lives,[br]and I can't cut it any more.

00:28:41.03,00:28:42.52
I need out. I'm unfit.

00:28:47.40,00:28:49.16
I think I've lost my faith, Tom.

00:28:52.74,00:28:53.90
Hello?

00:28:54.07,00:28:55.80
Yes, this is Mrs. MacNeil.

00:28:56.88,00:28:58.87
Operator, you have got to be kidding!

00:28:58.94,00:29:01.61
I have been on this line for 20 minutes!

00:29:02.05,00:29:04.52
Jesus Christ, can you believe this?

00:29:04.58,00:29:07.58
He doesn't even call his daughter[br]on her birthday!

00:29:08.52,00:29:11.01
Oh, circuits, my ass![br]He doesn't give a shit!

00:29:11.29,00:29:14.45
-Why don't you let me--[br]-No, I've got it, Sharon. It's all right.

00:29:16.46,00:29:20.12
Operator, don't tell me there's no answer.[br]It's the Hotel Excelsior in Rome!

00:29:20.20,00:29:22.69
Would you try it again, please,[br]and let it ring?

00:29:23.04,00:29:24.66
Hello? Yes.

00:29:26.07,00:29:29.30
No, Operator,[br]I've given you the number four times!

00:29:30.08,00:29:33.44
What do you do, take an illiteracy test[br]to get that job, for Christ's sake?

00:29:33.51,00:29:36.07
Don't tell me to be calm, goddamn it!

00:29:36.55,00:29:38.98
I've been on this fucking line[br]for 20 minutes!

00:29:50.73,00:29:52.09
Yeah?

00:29:53.83,00:29:55.66
You're kidding me!

00:29:58.34,00:29:59.90
I thought I just went to bed.

00:30:03.94,00:30:05.67
What are we doing, Scene 61?

00:30:07.45,00:30:10.07
Oh, just remind Phil[br]about that blue belt, huh?

00:30:25.70,00:30:27.16
What are you doing here?

00:30:27.83,00:30:29.96
My bed was shaking.

00:30:30.30,00:30:31.93
I can't get to sleep.

00:31:55.35,00:31:56.68
Goddamn it!

00:32:44.84,00:32:47.40
Jesus Christ, Karl, don't do that!

00:32:48.21,00:32:50.70
I'm very sorry, but you see? No rats.

00:32:50.91,00:32:53.47
No rats. Thanks a lot. That's terrific.

00:34:04.75,00:34:07.18
The edema affected her brain,[br]you understand?

00:34:07.25,00:34:08.95
She don't let no doctor come near her.

00:34:09.02,00:34:11.72
She was all the time screaming,[br]even talking to the radio.

00:34:11.79,00:34:13.72
You should've called me when it happened.

00:34:13.79,00:34:16.82
Regular hospital is not going[br]to put up with that, Dimmie.

00:34:16.93,00:34:18.79
So we give her a shot and bring her here...

00:34:18.86,00:34:21.96
...until the doctors fix up her leg,[br]then we take her right out.

00:34:22.03,00:34:24.47
Two or three months and she's out,[br]good as new!

00:34:32.54,00:34:33.91
We want to see Mrs. Karras.

00:34:33.98,00:34:35.50
-Do you have an appointment?[br]-Yes.

00:34:35.58,00:34:38.28
-Are you a relative?[br]-I am her brother. He is her son.

00:34:38.85,00:34:39.94
Just a minute.

00:35:03.21,00:35:04.57
You know, it's funny...

00:35:04.91,00:35:08.11
...if you weren't a priest, you'd be[br]a famous psychiatrist now on Park Avenue.

00:35:08.18,00:35:11.08
Your mother would be living[br]in a penthouse instead of there.

00:35:15.99,00:35:18.72
You go in, Dimmie.[br]I'll wait for you outside.

00:35:21.46,00:35:24.49
You'll find Mrs. Karras on the last bed[br]on the left-hand side.

00:35:52.99,00:35:54.22
It's Dimmie, Mama.

00:36:00.47,00:36:02.87
Why did you do this to me, Dimmie?

00:36:03.30,00:36:04.27
Why?

00:36:07.77,00:36:11.40
Come on, I'll take you out of here.[br]Mama, I'm going to take you home.

00:36:13.98,00:36:17.31
Mama, everything's going to be all right.[br]I'm going to take you home.

00:36:22.65,00:36:24.28
Couldn't you have put her someplace else?

00:36:24.36,00:36:27.98
Like what? Private hospital?[br]Who's got the money for that, Dimmie?

00:36:28.49,00:36:29.46
You?

00:37:01.16,00:37:04.36
There seems to be[br]an alien pubic hair in my drink.

00:37:05.03,00:37:06.02
I beg your pardon?

00:37:06.10,00:37:09.36
Never seen it before in my life. Have you?

00:37:16.57,00:37:18.34
We're pretty comfortable up there...

00:37:18.41,00:37:21.78
...compared to the Gemini and Mercury[br]programs, where they were tight for space.

00:37:21.85,00:37:25.25
You see, we've got about 210 cubic feet,[br]so we can move around.

00:37:25.38,00:37:28.05
If you ever go up there again,[br]will you take me along?

00:37:28.22,00:37:29.28
What for?

00:37:29.99,00:37:31.35
First missionary on Mars!

00:37:31.42,00:37:36.26
Tell me, was it public relations you did[br]for the Gestapo or community relations?

00:37:36.59,00:37:37.56
I'm Swiss!

00:37:37.63,00:37:38.79
Yes, of course.

00:37:39.93,00:37:43.20
And you never went bowling[br]with Goebbels, either, I suppose, huh?

00:37:44.44,00:37:46.03
Nazi bastard!

00:37:46.17,00:37:50.01
Over behind the church. You know where[br]I mean? It's a red brick wing.

00:37:51.24,00:37:54.27
What goes on there? I mean,[br]who's the priest I keep seeing there?

00:37:54.35,00:37:55.31
He's there all the time.

00:37:55.38,00:37:58.28
He has black hair and he's[br]very intense looking. Who's that?

00:37:58.35,00:38:01.48
Damien Karras.[br]That's his office the back of Saint Mike's.

00:38:01.79,00:38:03.85
He's our psychiatric counselor.

00:38:06.09,00:38:09.72
He had a pretty rough knock last night,[br]poor guy. His mother passed away.

00:38:09.86,00:38:11.76
She was living by herself, and...

00:38:12.23,00:38:15.29
...I guess she was dead a couple of days[br]before they found her.

00:38:17.57,00:38:19.09
Cunting Hun!

00:38:19.80,00:38:23.43
Bloody, damned, butchering, Nazi pig!

00:38:24.41,00:38:26.74
Stop it! I'll kill you!

00:38:39.66,00:38:41.25
What's for dessert?

00:38:49.07,00:38:50.26
You sleeping?

00:39:08.49,00:39:12.62
Burke, your car's at the curb.[br]Louie's waiting. It's nice and warm.

00:39:21.43,00:39:22.92
Yes, honey. What?

00:39:32.18,00:39:34.77
Oh, was he acting up! Why?

00:39:44.89,00:39:46.38
Hi, Chris, it's a great party.

00:39:46.46,00:39:48.02
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.

00:39:48.09,00:39:52.32
I don't need any encouragement. My idea[br]of Heaven is a solid white nightclub...

00:39:52.50,00:39:56.49
...with me as a headliner for all eternity,[br]and they love me.

00:39:58.40,00:40:03.14
"Down on the eastside of toidy-toid[br]and toid

00:40:03.27,00:40:07.80
"That's my home sweet home! "

00:40:17.89,00:40:19.38
I think we've got a guest.

00:40:22.03,00:40:23.69
You're going to die up there.

00:40:33.07,00:40:34.47
Oh, my God, honey.

00:40:34.87,00:40:36.53
Honey, what's the matter?

00:40:37.04,00:40:40.27
I'm sorry, she's been sick.[br]She didn't know what she was saying.

00:40:50.59,00:40:52.28
What made you say that, Regan?

00:40:54.93,00:40:56.33
Do you know, sweetheart?

00:41:02.17,00:41:03.29
Mother?

00:41:04.37,00:41:05.77
What's wrong with me?

00:41:13.04,00:41:16.88
It's just like the doctor said.[br]It's nerves, and that's all.

00:41:18.52,00:41:21.14
You just take your pills[br]and you'll be fine. Really.

00:41:21.79,00:41:22.95
Okay?

00:41:48.45,00:41:50.00
Is it coming out, Willie?

00:41:50.38,00:41:52.11
Yes, I think so.

00:41:55.15,00:41:56.38
Mother!

00:42:42.80,00:42:45.77
Where'd you get the money[br]for the Chivas Rega, the poor box?

00:42:46.34,00:42:48.60
That's an insult. I've got a vow of poverty.

00:42:51.94,00:42:53.47
Where'd you get it, then?

00:42:53.71,00:42:54.70
I stole it.

00:42:57.62,00:42:58.71
I believe you.

00:42:59.05,00:43:02.38
College presidents shouldn't drink.[br]Tends to set a bad example.

00:43:02.72,00:43:04.92
I figure I saved him from a big temptation.

00:43:07.56,00:43:08.89
Oh, Christ!

00:43:09.23,00:43:11.56
I should have been there. I wasn't there.

00:43:12.06,00:43:13.76
There was nothing you could do.

00:43:14.40,00:43:15.46
Lie down.

00:43:16.40,00:43:18.27
Give me the butt. Come on.

00:43:21.44,00:43:22.84
Now you think you can sleep?

00:43:23.11,00:43:25.94
What are you going to do,[br]steal my shoes now?

00:43:26.24,00:43:27.23
No.

00:43:27.51,00:43:30.88
I tell fortunes by reading the creases.[br]Now, shut up and go to sleep.

00:43:42.53,00:43:44.09
Good night.

00:43:50.33,00:43:52.06
Stealing is a sin.

00:44:39.32,00:44:40.81
I don't want it!

00:44:41.72,00:44:43.45
Honey, it's to help you.

00:44:43.85,00:44:45.32
I don't want it!

00:44:46.99,00:44:48.58
You fucking bastard!

00:44:49.89,00:44:52.86
Remember also, O Lord,[br]Thy servant, Mary Karras...

00:44:56.37,00:45:00.74
...who has gone before us, with the sign[br]of faith, and sleeps the sleep of peace.

00:45:03.21,00:45:06.54
"Lord, I am not worthy to receive you.

00:45:07.28,00:45:10.08
"But only say the Word[br]and I shall be healed.

00:45:12.72,00:45:15.48
"May the body of Christ bring thee[br]to everlasting life."

00:45:30.30,00:45:32.46
It's a symptom...

00:45:35.27,00:45:39.04
...of a type of disturbance in[br]the chemical-electrical activity of the brain.

00:45:39.38,00:45:41.28
In the case of your daughter,[br]in the temporal lobe.

00:45:41.35,00:45:43.71
That's up here in the lateral part[br]of the brain.

00:45:44.38,00:45:47.08
It's rare, but it does cause[br]bizarre hallucinations...

00:45:47.32,00:45:49.45
...and usually just before a convulsion.

00:45:49.52,00:45:50.58
A convulsion?

00:45:50.76,00:45:53.92
The shaking of the bed.[br]That's doubtless due to muscular spasms.

00:45:55.19,00:45:57.46
No, no, that was no spasm.

00:45:58.40,00:46:03.23
I got on the bed. The whole bed was[br]thumping and rising off the floor...

00:46:03.33,00:46:06.03
...and shaking, the whole thing![br]With me on it!

00:46:06.30,00:46:09.40
Mrs. MacNeil, the problem[br]with your daughter is not her bed.

00:46:09.47,00:46:10.63
It's her brain.

00:46:19.12,00:46:20.55
What causes this?

00:46:21.29,00:46:22.84
Lesion in the temporal lobe.

00:46:22.92,00:46:24.68
It's a kind of seizure disorder.

00:46:24.86,00:46:29.09
Look, Doc, I really don't understand[br]how her whole personality could change.

00:46:29.73,00:46:31.63
In temporal lobe, it's very common.

00:46:31.80,00:46:32.66
It is?

00:46:33.36,00:46:35.23
It can last for days, even weeks.

00:46:36.27,00:46:38.74
It isn't rare to find destructive...

00:46:39.34,00:46:40.74
...even criminal behavior.

00:46:42.94,00:46:45.57
Hey, do me a favor, will you?[br]Tell me something good.

00:46:45.88,00:46:49.87
Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion,[br]in a way, she's fortunate.

00:46:50.45,00:46:52.47
All we have to do is remove the scar.

00:47:08.57,00:47:10.69
Regan, can you sit up and scoot over here?

00:47:17.21,00:47:18.51
A little more.

00:47:19.24,00:47:20.57
Good.

00:47:24.82,00:47:27.81
I'm just going to move you down[br]on the table, okay?

00:47:40.23,00:47:41.99
Just for a short time.

00:47:56.71,00:47:57.65
Very sticky.

00:47:59.25,00:48:02.41
Now, Regan, you're going to feel[br]something a little cold and wet.

00:48:13.70,00:48:17.03
Now you're going to feel a little stick here.[br]Don't move.

00:48:21.87,00:48:23.27
Good.

00:48:27.71,00:48:31.11
You're going to feel some pressure here.[br]Now, don't move.

00:49:29.24,00:49:30.30
Hook up!

00:50:02.94,00:50:04.50
There's just nothing there.

00:50:04.91,00:50:06.77
No vascular displacement at all.

00:50:07.34,00:50:09.14
Do you want me to run another series?

00:50:09.98,00:50:11.07
I don't think so.

00:50:11.25,00:50:12.88
I'd like you to see her again.

00:50:13.28,00:50:16.12
Excuse me, Doctor.[br]Chris MacNeil is on the phone.

00:50:16.22,00:50:17.52
She says it's urgent.

00:50:18.19,00:50:19.71
Have you got some time?

00:50:25.90,00:50:26.83
Dr. Klein?

00:50:26.90,00:50:29.16
Yes, I'm Dr. Klein. This is Dr. Tanney.

00:50:29.53,00:50:32.00
Things have gotten worse since I phoned.[br]Come upstairs.

00:50:32.10,00:50:34.59
-Is she having the spasms again?[br]-Yeah, but they've gotten violent.

00:50:34.67,00:50:36.77
Did you give her[br]the medication I gave you?

00:50:36.84,00:50:38.57
-What was that?[br]-Thorazine.

00:50:39.68,00:50:41.24
Before that, it was Ritalin.

00:50:44.52,00:50:45.85
Chris, doctors.

00:50:46.78,00:50:48.12
Mother, please!

00:50:48.22,00:50:50.74
Oh, please, Mother, make him stop!

00:50:50.82,00:50:53.12
It's burning! It's burning!

00:50:53.22,00:50:55.28
Do something, Doctor. Please, help her!

00:50:58.03,00:51:00.66
Make it stop! He's trying to kill me!

00:51:01.07,00:51:02.36
Mother!

00:51:11.21,00:51:12.30
Keep away!

00:51:12.44,00:51:13.71
The sow is mine!

00:51:14.68,00:51:15.80
Fuck me!

00:51:15.98,00:51:17.07
Fuck me!

00:51:28.36,00:51:29.62
Stay away from me!

00:51:33.86,00:51:34.85
Hold her tight!

00:51:34.93,00:51:36.87
Don't let them, Mother, please!

00:52:01.09,00:52:02.79
She's heavily sedated.

00:52:03.33,00:52:05.39
She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.

00:52:07.56,00:52:10.90
What was going on in there?[br]How could she fly off the bed like that?

00:52:12.04,00:52:16.30
Pathological states can induce[br]abnormal strength...

00:52:17.64,00:52:19.54
...accelerated motor performance.

00:52:20.48,00:52:21.81
For example...

00:52:22.78,00:52:26.74
...say a 90-pound woman sees her child[br]pinned under the wheel of a truck...

00:52:27.25,00:52:30.28
...runs out and lifts the wheels[br]a half foot up off the ground.

00:52:30.79,00:52:33.19
You've heard the story. Same thing here.

00:52:35.03,00:52:36.55
Same principle, I mean.

00:52:39.66,00:52:41.19
So what's wrong with her?

00:52:43.07,00:52:44.93
We still think that the temporal lobe--

00:52:45.00,00:52:47.87
What are you talking about,[br]for Christ's sake?

00:52:48.27,00:52:49.97
Did you see her or not?

00:52:50.51,00:52:52.74
She's acting like she's fucking[br]out of her mind!

00:52:52.81,00:52:56.30
Psychotic, like a split personality, or....

00:53:01.45,00:53:03.98
There haven't been more than[br]a hundred authentic cases...

00:53:04.05,00:53:06.92
...of so-called "split personality,"[br]Mrs. MacNeil.

00:53:08.63,00:53:12.29
Now, I know the temptation is[br]to leap to psychiatry...

00:53:13.33,00:53:17.86
...but any reasonable psychiatrist would[br]exhaust the somatic possibilities first.

00:53:20.87,00:53:21.96
So, what's next?

00:53:23.27,00:53:27.27
A pneumoencephalogram,[br]I would think, to pin down that lesion.

00:53:27.88,00:53:29.68
It will involve another spinal.

00:53:29.75,00:53:30.91
Oh, Christ!

00:53:31.18,00:53:34.55
What we missed in the EEG[br]and the arteriograms...

00:53:34.85,00:53:36.72
...could conceivably turn up there.

00:53:38.32,00:53:42.09
At least it would eliminate[br]certain other possibilities.

00:53:56.41,00:53:58.37
Dr. Tanney says the X-rays are negative.

00:53:59.58,00:54:01.10
In other words: normal.

00:54:09.05,00:54:10.68
Do you keep any drugs in your house?

00:54:10.75,00:54:13.72
No, of course not. Nothing like that.

00:54:14.46,00:54:15.62
Are you sure?

00:54:15.79,00:54:17.78
Of course, I'm sure.

00:54:18.10,00:54:19.12
I'd tell you.

00:54:19.70,00:54:21.46
Christ, I don't even smoke grass.

00:54:27.24,00:54:29.33
Are you planning to be home soon?

00:54:29.51,00:54:31.00
I mean to L.A.

00:54:34.71,00:54:35.84
No, l...

00:54:37.51,00:54:39.28
...I'm building a new house.

00:54:40.55,00:54:42.11
My old one has been sold.

00:54:52.23,00:54:56.36
I was going to take Regan to Europe[br]for a while after she finished school.

00:54:59.44,00:55:00.49
Why do you ask?

00:55:04.27,00:55:07.44
I think it's time we started[br]looking for a psychiatrist.

00:55:36.64,00:55:37.80
Hello?

00:56:57.49,00:57:00.42
What the hell do you mean going off[br]and leaving Regan by herself?

00:57:00.49,00:57:02.52
Are you crazy? Her window's wide open!

00:57:02.79,00:57:04.95
-Didn't he tell you?[br]-Didn't who tell me?

00:57:05.43,00:57:06.79
What's Burke got to do with it?

00:57:06.86,00:57:09.30
There wasn't anybody here,[br]so when I went to get the Thorazine...

00:57:09.37,00:57:10.99
...I had him stay with her, and....

00:57:11.94,00:57:13.10
I should have known better.

00:57:13.17,00:57:14.66
I guess you should have!

00:57:14.77,00:57:16.03
How were the tests?

00:57:16.31,00:57:18.33
We have to start looking for a shrink.

00:57:18.68,00:57:20.30
Hi, Chuck. Come on in.

00:57:21.78,00:57:23.14
I suppose you heard.

00:57:23.31,00:57:24.51
Heard what?

00:57:27.38,00:57:28.54
You haven't heard.

00:57:31.02,00:57:32.25
Burke is dead.

00:57:35.69,00:57:39.09
He must have been drunk. He fell down[br]from the top of the steps right outside.

00:57:39.20,00:57:41.79
By the time he hit 'M' street,[br]he broke his neck.

00:57:43.30,00:57:44.63
Oh, God!

00:57:54.41,00:57:56.90
Yeah, I know.

00:57:58.58,00:58:01.75
When I touch your forehead,[br]open your eyes.

00:58:08.99,00:58:10.55
Are you comfortable, Regan?

00:58:13.66,00:58:14.63
Yes.

00:58:16.47,00:58:17.59
How old are you?

00:58:18.17,00:58:19.29
Twelve.

00:58:21.04,00:58:22.67
Is there someone inside you?

00:58:24.11,00:58:25.47
Sometimes.

00:58:27.38,00:58:28.34
Who is it?

00:58:29.58,00:58:30.74
I don't know.

00:58:31.92,00:58:33.21
Is it Captain Howdy?

00:58:34.02,00:58:35.18
I don't know.

00:58:35.99,00:58:38.58
If I ask him to tell me,[br]will you let him answer?

00:58:40.72,00:58:41.69
No.

00:58:42.89,00:58:43.86
Why not?

00:58:44.56,00:58:45.96
I'm afraid.

00:58:46.83,00:58:49.09
If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you.

00:58:49.43,00:58:50.90
Do you want him to leave you?

00:58:52.04,00:58:53.02
Yes.

00:59:01.95,00:59:04.68
I'm speaking to the person[br]inside of Regan now.

00:59:05.48,00:59:08.14
If you are there, you, too, are hypnotized...

00:59:08.55,00:59:10.65
...and must answer all my questions.

00:59:12.42,00:59:13.65
Come forward...

00:59:15.99,00:59:17.29
...and answer me now.

00:59:27.74,00:59:29.80
Are you the person inside of Regan?

00:59:34.38,00:59:35.47
Who are you?

01:00:33.64,01:00:34.97
Father Karras?

01:00:38.71,01:00:39.80
Have we met?

01:00:41.41,01:00:44.07
No, we haven't met,[br]but they said I could tell.

01:00:45.38,01:00:47.08
That you look like a boxer.

01:00:48.62,01:00:50.61
William F. Kinderman. Homicide.

01:00:51.86,01:00:53.25
What's this all about?

01:00:53.66,01:00:55.89
It's true. You do look like a boxer.

01:00:57.03,01:01:00.19
Like John Garfield in "Body And Soul."

01:01:00.33,01:01:03.63
Exactly. John Garfield.[br]Do people tell you that, Father?

01:01:04.97,01:01:06.99
Do people tell you[br]you look like Paul Newman?

01:01:07.07,01:01:08.09
Always.

01:01:15.25,01:01:19.77
You know this director who was[br]doing the film here, Burke Dennings?

01:01:20.45,01:01:21.38
I've seen him.

01:01:22.15,01:01:23.18
You've seen him.

01:01:24.39,01:01:27.05
You're also familiar how last week he died?

01:01:28.16,01:01:29.52
Only what I read in the papers.

01:01:29.99,01:01:33.95
Father, what do you know[br]on the subject of witchcraft?

01:01:35.27,01:01:37.46
From the witching end, not the hunting.

01:01:38.40,01:01:39.80
I once did a paper on it.

01:01:40.34,01:01:41.57
Really?

01:01:41.81,01:01:43.17
From the psychiatric end.

01:01:44.67,01:01:45.87
I know. I read it.

01:01:48.04,01:01:51.01
All of this desecration in the church...

01:01:51.08,01:01:53.38
...does this have anything to do[br]with witchcraft?

01:01:55.09,01:01:57.58
Maybe. Some rituals used[br]in the Black Mass.

01:01:58.26,01:02:02.02
And now, Dennings.[br]You read how he died?

01:02:02.89,01:02:03.92
In a fall.

01:02:07.50,01:02:11.02
Let me tell you how. Please, Father...

01:02:12.67,01:02:13.73
...confidential.

01:02:15.97,01:02:18.87
Burke Dennings, good Father, was found...

01:02:18.94,01:02:21.17
...at the bottom of those steps[br]leading to 'M' street...

01:02:21.28,01:02:23.84
...with his head turned completely around...

01:02:24.41,01:02:25.71
...facing backwards.

01:02:31.99,01:02:33.46
That didn't happen in the fall?

01:02:33.82,01:02:34.98
It's possible.

01:02:37.26,01:02:39.46
-Possible. However--[br]-Unlikely.

01:02:40.40,01:02:41.52
Exactly.

01:02:43.27,01:02:47.53
So, on the one hand,[br]we've got a witchcraft kind of murder...

01:02:47.60,01:02:52.51
...and on the other hand, a Black Mass-type[br]desecration in the church.

01:02:53.14,01:02:55.74
You think the killer[br]and the desecrator are the same?

01:02:57.91,01:03:01.08
Maybe somebody crazy, somebody with...

01:03:01.15,01:03:02.74
...a spite against the church.

01:03:02.82,01:03:05.19
Some unconscious rebellion.

01:03:05.69,01:03:06.99
A sick priest, is that it?

01:03:07.06,01:03:10.93
Look, Father, this is hard for you.[br]Please, I understand...

01:03:12.13,01:03:15.56
...but for priests on the campus here,[br]you're the psychiatrist.

01:03:15.63,01:03:18.12
You'd know who was sick at the time,[br]who wasn't.

01:03:18.20,01:03:20.60
I mean, this kind of sickness,[br]you'd know that.

01:03:21.17,01:03:23.30
I don't know anyone[br]who fits that description.

01:03:28.75,01:03:31.41
Doctor's ethics. If you knew,[br]you wouldn't tell, huh?

01:03:31.51,01:03:32.88
No, I probably wouldn't.

01:03:33.32,01:03:35.98
Not to bother you with trivia,[br]but a psychiatrist...

01:03:36.32,01:03:38.69
...in sunny California, no less...

01:03:39.42,01:03:43.12
...was put in jail for not telling the police[br]what he knew about a patient.

01:03:44.56,01:03:45.53
Is that a threat?

01:03:45.60,01:03:47.59
No, I mention it only in passing.

01:03:50.50,01:03:52.33
Incidentally, I mention it only in passing...

01:03:52.40,01:03:55.46
...I could always tell the judge[br]it was a matter of confession.

01:04:00.54,01:04:02.01
Father, wait a minute!

01:04:02.08,01:04:04.14
-Do you like movies?[br]-Very much.

01:04:04.25,01:04:06.94
Well, I get passes[br]to the best shows in town.

01:04:07.42,01:04:10.58
Mrs. "K," you know,[br]she gets tired, never likes to go.

01:04:11.32,01:04:12.41
That's too bad.

01:04:12.49,01:04:13.65
I hate to go alone.

01:04:13.76,01:04:16.25
I love to talk film...

01:04:16.83,01:04:19.09
...discuss, to critique.

01:04:20.06,01:04:24.16
You want to see a film with me?[br]I've got passes to the Crest. It's "Othello."

01:04:25.34,01:04:27.06
Who's in it?

01:04:27.37,01:04:31.07
Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona and Othello:[br]Groucho Marx. Are you happy?

01:04:31.51,01:04:32.48
I've seen it.

01:04:33.84,01:04:37.57
One last time. Can you think[br]of some priest who fits the bill?

01:04:37.65,01:04:38.38
Come on!

01:04:38.45,01:04:41.21
No, answer the question, Father Paranoia.

01:04:46.82,01:04:48.35
You know who I think really did it?

01:04:48.49,01:04:49.36
Who?

01:04:49.49,01:04:51.26
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.

01:04:52.06,01:04:53.93
I could have you deported, you know that?

01:04:56.67,01:04:57.72
I lied.

01:04:59.30,01:05:00.93
You look like Sal Mineo.

01:05:05.44,01:05:08.81
It looks like a type of disorder[br]that's rarely ever seen anymore...

01:05:08.88,01:05:11.11
...except in primitive cultures.

01:05:11.58,01:05:15.07
We call it "somnambuliform possession."

01:05:16.12,01:05:19.82
Quite frankly, we really don't know[br]much about it at all, except that it...

01:05:20.42,01:05:23.69
...it starts with a conflict or a guilt...

01:05:23.76,01:05:26.16
...and it leads to the patient's delusions[br]that his body...

01:05:26.23,01:05:30.39
...has been invaded[br]by some alien intelligence:

01:05:31.70,01:05:32.76
A spirit, if you will.

01:05:32.84,01:05:35.93
Look, I'm telling you again,[br]and you'd better believe me...

01:05:36.61,01:05:39.60
...I am not going to lock her up[br]in some goddamn asylum!

01:05:40.78,01:05:43.87
And I don't care what you call it.[br]I'm not putting her away!

01:05:44.98,01:05:46.01
I'm sorry.

01:05:46.08,01:05:48.92
You're sorry? Jesus Christ, 88 doctors...

01:05:48.99,01:05:51.45
...and all you can tell me,[br]with all your bullshit is....

01:06:09.51,01:06:13.20
Of course, there is one[br]outside chance for a cure.

01:06:17.41,01:06:20.18
I think of it as a shock treatment.

01:06:22.02,01:06:23.99
As I said, it's a very outside chance.

01:06:24.05,01:06:26.58
Would you just name it,[br]for God's sake? What is it?

01:06:26.82,01:06:28.55
Do you have any religious beliefs?

01:06:28.89,01:06:29.82
No.

01:06:29.89,01:06:31.38
What about your daughter?

01:06:32.23,01:06:33.02
No.

01:06:33.10,01:06:34.09
Why?

01:06:34.33,01:06:36.06
Have you ever heard of exorcism?

01:06:38.33,01:06:41.93
Well, it's a stylized ritual in which the...

01:06:43.31,01:06:47.07
...Rabbi or the Priest try to drive out[br]the so-called invading spirit.

01:06:47.98,01:06:50.78
It's been pretty much discarded[br]these days except by...

01:06:50.95,01:06:54.91
...the Catholics, who keep it in the closet[br]as a sort of embarrassment. But...

01:06:55.52,01:06:57.42
...it has worked...

01:06:58.15,01:07:01.06
...in fact, although,[br]not for the reasons they think.

01:07:01.86,01:07:04.92
It's purely force of suggestion.

01:07:05.46,01:07:08.52
The victim's belief in possession...

01:07:09.37,01:07:11.89
...is what helped cause it,[br]so in that same way...

01:07:12.10,01:07:15.13
...the belief in the power of exorcism[br]can make it disappear.

01:07:17.94,01:07:21.27
You're telling me I should take[br]my daughter to a witch doctor.

01:07:22.81,01:07:23.84
Is that it?

01:09:05.95,01:09:07.81
Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?

01:09:11.15,01:09:12.52
She's going to be well?

01:09:14.12,01:09:18.29
Karl, if you put this in Regan's bedroom,[br]I want you to tell me. Now, did you?

01:09:18.86,01:09:20.76
No, not me.

01:09:21.73,01:09:22.79
I didn't.

01:09:41.02,01:09:44.01
This was under Regan's pillow.[br]Did you put it there?

01:09:44.62,01:09:45.92
Of course, I didn't.

01:09:47.59,01:09:48.68
I didn't put it.

01:09:50.69,01:09:51.68
Excuse me, Madam.

01:09:51.76,01:09:52.75
What?

01:09:54.10,01:09:55.22
A man to see you.

01:09:55.53,01:09:56.62
What man?

01:10:02.94,01:10:05.10
Might your daughter remember, perhaps...

01:10:05.17,01:10:08.11
...if Mr. Dennings was in her room[br]that night?

01:10:09.91,01:10:11.21
Why do you ask?

01:10:12.22,01:10:13.71
Might she remember?

01:10:17.19,01:10:18.98
No, she was heavily sedated.

01:10:20.02,01:10:21.22
It's serious?

01:10:22.29,01:10:23.69
Yes, I'm afraid it is.

01:10:25.43,01:10:26.42
May I ask...?

01:10:26.53,01:10:27.76
We still don't know.

01:10:28.93,01:10:30.49
Watch out for drafts.

01:10:30.67,01:10:33.13
A draft in the fall,[br]when the house is hot, is...

01:10:33.77,01:10:35.76
...a magic carpet for bacteria.

01:10:36.04,01:10:38.10
Excuse me, Madam. Anything else?

01:10:38.21,01:10:40.20
No, Karl, we're fine. Thank you.

01:10:40.84,01:10:41.90
It's all right.

01:10:46.82,01:10:48.31
Why are you asking all this?

01:10:48.72,01:10:49.84
It's strange.

01:10:51.29,01:10:54.85
The deceased comes to visit,[br]stays only 20 minutes...

01:10:55.89,01:10:59.35
...and leaves all alone a very sick girl.

01:11:01.46,01:11:03.26
And speaking plainly, Mrs. MacNeil...

01:11:03.33,01:11:07.77
...it isn't likely he would[br]fall from a window.

01:11:09.21,01:11:12.20
Besides, a fall wouldn't do to his neck[br]what we found.

01:11:12.28,01:11:14.68
Except maybe one chance in a thousand.

01:11:15.71,01:11:17.04
No. My hunch....

01:11:18.21,01:11:20.55
My opinion...

01:11:21.65,01:11:25.55
...he was killed by a very powerful man:[br]point one.

01:11:27.06,01:11:29.55
And the fracturing of his skull: point two.

01:11:29.63,01:11:32.19
Plus the various other things[br]we mentioned...

01:11:33.63,01:11:35.56
...would make it very probable...

01:11:36.67,01:11:38.60
...probable, not certain...

01:11:40.17,01:11:44.77
...that the deceased was killed and then[br]pushed from your daughter's window.

01:11:46.01,01:11:50.38
But nobody was in the room[br]except your daughter, so how can this be?

01:11:54.52,01:11:56.04
It could be one way.

01:11:57.25,01:12:00.38
If someone came calling[br]between the time Miss Spencer left...

01:12:00.46,01:12:02.15
...and the time you returned.

01:12:02.53,01:12:04.49
Judas Priest, just a second.

01:12:06.10,01:12:07.93
The servants? They have visitors?

01:12:08.23,01:12:09.22
Not at all.

01:12:09.33,01:12:11.96
You were expecting a package that day,[br]some delivery?

01:12:12.03,01:12:13.37
Not that I know of.

01:12:13.47,01:12:16.23
Groceries, cleaning...a package?

01:12:16.31,01:12:18.87
I really wouldn't know.[br]Karl takes care of all that.

01:12:21.11,01:12:22.27
I see.

01:12:22.58,01:12:24.05
Would you like to ask him?

01:12:25.62,01:12:27.01
No, never mind, it's...

01:12:29.22,01:12:30.85
...it's very remote.

01:12:32.36,01:12:34.26
No, never mind.

01:12:45.33,01:12:46.67
Would you like some more coffee?

01:12:48.00,01:12:49.03
Please.

01:13:24.51,01:13:25.50
That's cute.

01:13:27.28,01:13:29.11
Your daughter, she's the artist?

01:13:31.85,01:13:33.25
Thank you.

01:13:34.48,01:13:35.81
Incidentally...

01:13:37.39,01:13:39.15
...you might ask your daughter if she...

01:13:39.22,01:13:42.05
...remembers seeing Mr. Dennings[br]in her room that night.

01:13:42.89,01:13:46.12
Look, he wouldn't have any reason[br]in the world to go up to her room.

01:13:46.20,01:13:48.39
Oh, I know, I realize, but...

01:13:49.83,01:13:52.93
...if certain British doctors had[br]never asked, "What is this fungus?"...

01:13:53.00,01:13:55.30
...we wouldn't today have penicillin.[br]Correct?

01:13:59.11,01:14:00.67
When she's better, I'll ask her.

01:14:01.14,01:14:02.37
It couldn't hurt.

01:14:03.28,01:14:04.80
In the meantime....

01:14:07.05,01:14:08.18
That's okay.

01:14:08.68,01:14:10.78
I really hate to ask you this, but...

01:14:13.26,01:14:16.28
...for my daughter,[br]could you please give an autograph?

01:14:17.39,01:14:19.55
Of course. Where's a pencil?

01:14:19.96,01:14:21.12
Right here.

01:14:24.00,01:14:25.13
She'd love it!

01:14:26.77,01:14:27.86
What's her name?

01:14:30.97,01:14:32.77
I lied. It's for me.

01:14:34.91,01:14:37.07
The spelling is on the back: Kinderman.

01:14:39.45,01:14:42.25
You know that film you made, "Angel"?

01:14:43.55,01:14:45.28
I saw that six times!

01:14:45.35,01:14:46.32
Really?

01:14:46.52,01:14:47.78
It was beautiful.

01:14:49.09,01:14:50.15
Thank you.

01:14:53.26,01:14:55.39
You're a very nice lady.

01:14:58.67,01:15:00.83
-Thank you.[br]-You're a nice man.

01:15:02.61,01:15:04.84
I'll come back when she's feeling better.

01:15:08.88,01:15:10.68
-'Bye.[br]-'Bye.

01:15:31.83,01:15:33.36
Please, no!

01:15:33.77,01:15:35.57
-Do it![br]-Please, don't!

01:15:35.97,01:15:39.41
You bitch! Do it! Do it!

01:15:39.48,01:15:40.91
Please, no!

01:15:44.58,01:15:46.31
Let Jesus fuck you!

01:15:46.65,01:15:48.34
Let Jesus fuck you!

01:15:55.19,01:15:56.66
Give it! Give it to me!

01:15:59.76,01:16:01.92
Lick me! Lick me!

01:16:10.67,01:16:12.97
Mrs. MacNeil, open the door!

01:16:22.38,01:16:27.15
Do you know what she did,[br]your cunting daughter?

01:16:47.18,01:16:48.37
Chris MacNeil?

01:16:49.11,01:16:50.14
Please go away.

01:16:50.21,01:16:51.44
I'm Father Karras.

01:16:54.25,01:16:55.65
I'm very sorry. Hello.

01:16:56.35,01:16:58.72
It's all right. I should have told you[br]I wouldn't be in uniform.

01:16:58.79,01:17:00.52
Yeah, that would have helped.

01:17:00.59,01:17:02.39
Have you got a cigarette, Father?

01:17:06.96,01:17:08.36
Thanks.

01:17:20.31,01:17:21.67
Cold.

01:17:27.48,01:17:29.75
How did a shrink ever get to be a priest?

01:17:30.05,01:17:33.22
It's the other way around. The Society[br]sent me through medical school.

01:17:34.46,01:17:35.62
Where?

01:17:36.79,01:17:38.26
Harvard, Bellevue...

01:17:39.16,01:17:41.15
...Johns Hopkins. Places like that.

01:17:44.70,01:17:47.23
-You're a friend of Father Dyer's, right?[br]-Yes, I am.

01:17:47.84,01:17:49.70
-Pretty close?[br]-Pretty close.

01:17:50.31,01:17:51.86
Did he talk to you about my party?

01:17:52.37,01:17:53.43
He sure did.

01:17:54.58,01:17:55.67
About my daughter?

01:17:56.25,01:17:57.87
No, I didn't know you had one.

01:18:00.35,01:18:01.94
-He didn't mention her?[br]-No.

01:18:05.12,01:18:06.55
He didn't tell you what she did?

01:18:07.49,01:18:08.65
He didn't mention her.

01:18:10.96,01:18:12.95
Priests are pretty tight-mouthed,[br]then, huh?

01:18:13.50,01:18:14.62
That depends.

01:18:15.93,01:18:17.76
-On what?[br]-The priest.

01:18:21.64,01:18:23.37
I mean, what if a person...

01:18:24.84,01:18:28.47
...came to you, you know, that was[br]a murderer or a criminal of some kind...

01:18:28.81,01:18:32.21
...and they wanted some kind of help?

01:18:32.28,01:18:34.22
Would you have to turn them in?

01:18:34.45,01:18:37.25
Well, if he came to me for spiritual advice,[br]I'd say no.

01:18:37.59,01:18:39.21
-You wouldn't?[br]-No, I wouldn't.

01:18:40.19,01:18:42.62
But I would try to convince him[br]to turn himself in.

01:18:44.29,01:18:47.49
And, how do you go about[br]getting an exorcism?

01:18:52.67,01:18:53.83
I beg your pardon?

01:18:58.77,01:19:02.80
If a person's, you know,[br]possessed by a demon, or something...

01:19:03.31,01:19:05.11
...how do they get an exorcism?

01:19:06.45,01:19:08.42
First thing, I'd have to get them[br]into a time machine...

01:19:08.48,01:19:10.35
...and get them back to the 16th century.

01:19:10.45,01:19:11.65
I didn't get you.

01:19:12.35,01:19:14.22
It just doesn't happen any more,[br]Mrs. MacNeil.

01:19:14.66,01:19:16.09
Oh, yeah? Since when?

01:19:17.76,01:19:21.06
Since we learned about mental illness,[br]paranoia, schizophrenia...

01:19:21.93,01:19:23.86
...all those things they taught me[br]at Harvard.

01:19:23.93,01:19:26.37
Mrs. MacNeil,[br]since the day I joined the Jesuits...

01:19:26.80,01:19:30.57
...I've never met one priest[br]who has performed an exorcism. Not one.

01:19:32.07,01:19:33.10
Yeah, well...

01:19:36.38,01:19:39.61
...it just so happens[br]that somebody very close to me...

01:19:40.58,01:19:42.45
...is probably possessed.

01:19:43.22,01:19:44.69
And needs an exorcism.

01:19:45.39,01:19:47.48
Father Karras, it's my little girl.

01:19:49.63,01:19:51.62
Then that's all the more reason[br]to forget about exorcism.

01:19:52.19,01:19:53.59
Why? I don't understand.

01:19:53.70,01:19:55.53
To begin with, it could make things worse.

01:19:55.80,01:19:56.70
How?

01:19:56.80,01:19:59.10
Secondly, the Church,[br]before it approves an exorcism...

01:19:59.17,01:20:01.36
...conducts an investigation[br]to see if it's warranted.

01:20:01.44,01:20:03.20
That takes time.

01:20:03.61,01:20:04.83
You could do it yourself.

01:20:04.94,01:20:07.74
No, I couldn't. I'd need Church approval,[br]and that's rarely given.

01:20:11.81,01:20:12.87
Could you see her?

01:20:12.95,01:20:15.28
Yes, I could.[br]I could see her as a psychiatrist, but--

01:20:15.35,01:20:17.68
Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest!

01:20:17.82,01:20:20.72
She's already seen[br]every fucking psychiatrist in the world...

01:20:20.79,01:20:23.52
...and they sent me to you![br]Are you gonna send me back to them?

01:20:23.63,01:20:26.22
Jesus Christ, won't somebody help me?

01:20:26.83,01:20:29.76
Oh, God, can't you help her? Just help her!

01:21:00.83,01:21:02.30
It wants no straps.

01:21:18.15,01:21:19.84
Hello, Regan.

01:21:23.15,01:21:25.85
I'm a friend of your mother's.[br]I'd like to help you.

01:21:26.66,01:21:28.89
You might loosen these straps then.

01:21:29.99,01:21:31.96
I'm afraid you might hurt yourself, Regan.

01:21:33.03,01:21:34.50
I'm not Regan.

01:21:36.10,01:21:37.12
I see.

01:21:42.27,01:21:45.14
Well, then, let's introduce ourselves.[br]I'm Damien Karras.

01:21:45.47,01:21:46.84
And I am the devil.

01:21:47.11,01:21:48.94
Now kindly undo these straps.

01:21:49.75,01:21:52.34
If you're the devil,[br]why not make the straps disappear?

01:21:52.61,01:21:55.48
That's much too vulgar[br]a display of power, Karras.

01:21:57.15,01:21:58.31
Where's Regan?

01:21:58.69,01:22:00.52
In here, with us.

01:22:02.76,01:22:05.16
Show me Regan[br]and I'll loosen one of the straps.

01:22:05.33,01:22:07.42
Could you help an old altar boy, Father?

01:22:09.87,01:22:12.16
Your mother is in here with us, Karras.

01:22:12.40,01:22:14.34
Would you like to leave a message?

01:22:14.57,01:22:16.16
I'll see that she gets it.

01:22:22.21,01:22:23.44
If that's true...

01:22:26.35,01:22:28.65
...then you must know[br]my mother's maiden name.

01:22:30.85,01:22:31.95
What is it?

01:22:40.16,01:22:41.25
What is it?

01:23:35.65,01:23:37.28
Thank you.

01:23:39.66,01:23:43.59
Look, I'm only against the possibility[br]of doing her more harm than good.

01:23:45.06,01:23:47.39
Nothing you could do[br]could make it any worse.

01:23:48.63,01:23:49.72
I can't do it.

01:23:50.87,01:23:54.06
I need evidence that the Church[br]would accept as signs of possession.

01:23:54.40,01:23:55.30
Like what?

01:23:55.37,01:23:57.74
Like her speaking in a language[br]she's never known or studied.

01:23:57.81,01:23:58.93
What else?

01:24:00.41,01:24:03.04
I don't know. I'd have to look it up.

01:24:03.91,01:24:05.97
I thought you were supposed[br]to be an expert.

01:24:07.15,01:24:08.88
There are no experts.

01:24:09.89,01:24:12.82
You probably know as much[br]about possession as most priests.

01:24:14.02,01:24:16.29
Look, your daughter doesn't say[br]she's a demon.

01:24:16.36,01:24:18.16
She says she's the devil himself.

01:24:18.83,01:24:20.82
If you've seen as many psychotics[br]as I have...

01:24:20.90,01:24:24.13
...you'd realize that's the same as saying[br]you're Napoleon Bonaparte.

01:24:26.20,01:24:29.86
You asked me what I think[br]is best for your daughter.

01:24:31.61,01:24:34.44
Six months under observation...

01:24:35.04,01:24:37.07
...in the best hospital you can find.

01:24:40.02,01:24:41.57
You show me Regan's double...

01:24:42.32,01:24:45.55
...same face, same voice, everything...

01:24:46.52,01:24:48.35
...and I'd know it wasn't Regan.

01:24:49.46,01:24:50.76
I'd know in my gut.

01:24:52.53,01:24:55.50
I'm telling you that that thing upstairs[br]isn't my daughter.

01:24:56.80,01:24:59.36
Now, I want you to tell me[br]that you know for a fact...

01:24:59.43,01:25:02.60
...that there's nothing wrong[br]with my daughter except in her mind!

01:25:02.67,01:25:05.87
You tell me that you know for a fact[br]that an exorcism wouldn't do any good!

01:25:05.94,01:25:07.34
You tell me that!

01:25:19.32,01:25:21.41
Did Regan know a priest was coming over?

01:25:23.73,01:25:24.49
No.

01:25:24.56,01:25:26.53
Did you know my mother died recently?

01:25:27.50,01:25:28.99
Yes, I did. I'm very sorry.

01:25:30.77,01:25:32.20
Is Regan aware of it?

01:25:33.70,01:25:34.90
Not at all.

01:25:36.44,01:25:37.53
Why do you ask?

01:25:39.61,01:25:41.54
It's not important. Good night.

01:26:10.51,01:26:13.34
"He broke the bread,[br]and gave it to his disciples and said:

01:26:16.91,01:26:18.97
"Take this, all of you, and eat it.

01:26:23.19,01:26:24.71
"For this is my body.'

01:26:31.33,01:26:33.79
"When the supper was ended,[br]he took the cup.

01:26:34.63,01:26:36.79
"Again he gave you thanks and praise.

01:26:38.13,01:26:40.86
"He gave the cup to his disciples and said:[br]'Take this...

01:26:41.87,01:26:43.84
"...all of you, and drink from it.

01:26:47.68,01:26:49.44
"This is the cup of my blood.

01:26:51.88,01:26:55.44
"The blood of the new and everlasting[br]covenant, the mystery of faith."

01:26:57.12,01:26:59.38
What an excellent day for an exorcism.

01:27:01.66,01:27:02.95
You'd like that?

01:27:03.06,01:27:04.46
Intensely.

01:27:05.79,01:27:07.99
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?

01:27:08.33,01:27:10.09
It would bring us together.

01:27:11.97,01:27:13.13
You and Regan?

01:27:13.40,01:27:14.70
You and us.

01:27:26.31,01:27:27.47
Did you do that?

01:27:35.22,01:27:36.25
Do it again.

01:27:36.32,01:27:37.31
In time.

01:27:37.39,01:27:38.42
No, now.

01:27:39.06,01:27:40.22
In time.

01:27:41.86,01:27:44.53
Mirabile dictu, don't you agree?

01:27:46.70,01:27:47.83
You speak Latin?

01:27:48.37,01:27:50.67
Ego te absolvo.

01:27:51.81,01:27:53.17
Quod nomen mihi est?

01:27:54.11,01:27:55.10
Bonjour!

01:27:55.18,01:27:56.61
Quod nomen mihi est?

01:27:56.98,01:27:58.38
La plume de ma tante.

01:27:59.31,01:28:01.54
How long are you planning[br]to stay in Regan?

01:28:01.82,01:28:04.68
Until she rots and lies stinking in the earth.

01:28:07.49,01:28:08.65
What's that?

01:28:09.16,01:28:10.22
Holy water.

01:28:12.13,01:28:13.56
You keep it away!

01:28:16.93,01:28:18.37
It burns!

01:28:19.03,01:28:21.26
Oh, it burns!

01:28:44.59,01:28:46.62
Who are you?

01:28:58.27,01:29:00.61
You know, I'm like in seclusion.

01:29:05.01,01:29:06.98
No, I'm just exhausted from work.

01:29:11.65,01:29:14.75
She's, she's all right. She's just....

01:29:18.93,01:29:20.79
I don't want to talk about it, okay?

01:29:25.73,01:29:29.47
Okay, I'll talk to you, huh?[br]I'll call as soon as it's over, all right?

01:29:31.31,01:29:34.94
No, I just, I'm going through something[br]and I just have to....

01:29:36.81,01:29:37.94
No, no....

01:29:38.65,01:29:39.88
There's nothing.

01:29:41.38,01:29:43.32
Hey, thanks a lot.

01:29:59.37,01:30:01.06
-Want a drink?[br]-Please.

01:30:02.34,01:30:03.60
What do you drink?

01:30:04.14,01:30:05.13
Scotch.

01:30:06.78,01:30:08.11
Ice and water.

01:30:15.72,01:30:17.91
No ice. I'll get some from the kitchen.

01:30:18.02,01:30:19.49
That's all right. I'll take it straight.

01:30:19.55,01:30:21.11
No, that's fine. Please sit.

01:30:34.60,01:30:35.76
Where's her father?

01:30:36.27,01:30:37.36
In Europe.

01:30:37.77,01:30:39.76
-Have you told him what's happening?[br]-No.

01:30:39.84,01:30:41.40
Well, I think you should.

01:30:49.58,01:30:51.05
I told Regan that was holy water.

01:30:51.12,01:30:53.82
I sprinkled it on her[br]and she reacted very violently.

01:30:56.83,01:30:58.02
It's tap water.

01:30:58.23,01:30:59.56
What's the difference?

01:30:59.63,01:31:03.32
Holy water is blessed. And that doesn't[br]help support a case for possession.

01:31:14.71,01:31:17.68
She killed Burke Dennings.

01:31:18.55,01:31:19.57
What?

01:31:23.25,01:31:24.91
She killed Burke Dennings.

01:31:26.99,01:31:28.72
She pushed him out her window.

01:31:47.48,01:31:50.27
It's a language, all right. It's English.

01:31:51.65,01:31:52.77
What do you mean, English?

01:31:52.85,01:31:54.82
It's English in reverse. Listen.

01:31:55.78,01:31:57.27
Give us time.

01:31:57.69,01:31:59.38
Let her die.

01:32:02.62,01:32:05.09
I am no one. I am no one.

01:32:05.36,01:32:06.59
Fear the priest.

01:32:08.63,01:32:09.96
Fear the priest.

01:32:13.07,01:32:14.13
Merrin!

01:32:22.18,01:32:23.58
I am no one.

01:32:26.68,01:32:27.81
Merrin!

01:32:30.09,01:32:31.28
Merrin!

01:32:38.89,01:32:39.99
Yeah?

01:32:41.60,01:32:42.59
I'll be right there.

01:33:01.02,01:33:02.74
I don't want Chris to see this.

01:33:02.82,01:33:04.41
What's wrong? What is it?

01:34:14.32,01:34:15.98
You're convinced that it's genuine?

01:34:17.26,01:34:18.49
I don't know.

01:34:19.76,01:34:21.25
No, not really, I suppose.

01:34:22.50,01:34:23.73
But I have made...

01:34:24.77,01:34:28.33
...a prudent judgement that it meets[br]the conditions set down in the Ritual.

01:34:29.04,01:34:31.20
You would want to do[br]the exorcism yourself?

01:34:33.11,01:34:34.13
Yes.

01:34:38.21,01:34:40.01
It might be best to have a man[br]with experience.

01:34:40.08,01:34:43.02
Maybe someone who's spent time[br]in the foreign missions.

01:34:44.25,01:34:45.84
I understand, Your Excellency.

01:34:46.69,01:34:48.21
Let's see who's around.

01:34:48.32,01:34:50.81
In the meantime,[br]I'll call you as soon as I know.

01:34:52.19,01:34:53.68
Thank you, Your Excellency.

01:34:54.86,01:34:56.80
Well, he does know the background.

01:34:57.13,01:35:00.03
I doubt there's any danger[br]in just having him assist.

01:35:00.64,01:35:03.00
There should be[br]a psychiatrist present, anyway.

01:35:03.64,01:35:05.27
What about the exorcist?

01:35:05.61,01:35:06.84
Have you any ideas?

01:35:08.11,01:35:09.70
How about Lankester Merrin?

01:35:12.41,01:35:14.18
I had a notion he was over in Iraq.

01:35:14.25,01:35:16.41
I think I read he was working[br]on a dig near Nineveh.

01:35:16.48,01:35:18.01
You're right, but he's finished.

01:35:18.09,01:35:21.21
He came back three or four months ago.[br]He's at Woodstock now.

01:35:21.82,01:35:23.72
What's he doing there, teaching?

01:35:23.93,01:35:25.48
He's working on another book.

01:35:26.46,01:35:29.49
Don't you think he's too old, Tom?[br]How's his health?

01:35:30.57,01:35:33.80
He must be all right.[br]He's still running around digging up tombs.

01:35:36.10,01:35:38.37
Besides, he's had experience.

01:35:38.44,01:35:39.41
I didn't know that.

01:35:39.47,01:35:41.67
Ten, 12 years ago, I think, in Africa.

01:35:42.28,01:35:46.21
The exorcism supposedly lasted months.[br]I heard it damn near killed him.

01:35:50.52,01:35:51.85
Father?

01:36:58.69,01:37:00.71
-You're Mrs. MacNeil?[br]-Yes.

01:37:00.92,01:37:02.15
I'm Father Merrin.

01:37:02.46,01:37:03.45
Come in.

01:37:03.89,01:37:04.88
Thank you.

01:37:05.43,01:37:08.59
-Is Father Karras here?[br]-Yes. He's here already.

01:37:11.40,01:37:13.30
It's an honor to meet you, Father.

01:37:19.31,01:37:20.93
-Are you very tired?[br]-No.

01:37:22.61,01:37:25.37
I'd like you to go quickly[br]across to the Residence...

01:37:25.71,01:37:27.61
...and gather up a cassock for myself...

01:37:27.68,01:37:31.38
...two surplices, a purple stole,[br]and some holy water...

01:37:31.89,01:37:32.85
...and...

01:37:33.72,01:37:36.25
...your copy of "The Roman Ritual."[br]The large one.

01:37:36.89,01:37:38.36
I believe we should begin.

01:37:39.16,01:37:41.69
Do you want to hear the background[br]of the case first, Father?

01:37:41.76,01:37:42.75
Why?

01:37:44.80,01:37:48.36
Especially important is the warning[br]to avoid conversations with the demon.

01:37:50.17,01:37:54.23
We may ask what is relevant,[br]but anything beyond that is dangerous.

01:37:54.61,01:37:56.91
He's a liar. The demon is a liar.

01:37:57.01,01:37:58.64
He will lie to confuse us.

The attack is psychological, Damien.

01:38:11.06,01:38:12.22
And powerful.

Sure you won't change your mind?

01:57:59.05,01:58:00.71
I found this in her room.

01:58:06.22,01:58:07.71
You better hurry.

01:58:17.80,01:58:19.82
Come on, honey, we have to get going.

01:58:43.72,01:58:45.38
She doesn't remember any of it.
