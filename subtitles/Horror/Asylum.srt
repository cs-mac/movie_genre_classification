1
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:43,113
In here.

2
00:02:43,179 --> 00:02:44,448
Doctor's expecting you.

3
00:02:44,515 --> 00:02:45,716
Thank you.

4
00:02:50,552 --> 00:02:53,123
(Knock on door)

5
00:02:56,725 --> 00:02:58,730
Ah. Dr. Martin.

6
00:02:58,794 --> 00:03:01,533
Yes.

7
00:03:01,597 --> 00:03:03,968
You will forgive me for not rising.

8
00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:04,934
An accident?

9
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,904
You might call it that.

10
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,607
Carelessness actually.

11
00:03:09,672 --> 00:03:12,309
Never turn your back on a patient.

12
00:03:12,374 --> 00:03:13,776
They teach you that at school don't they?

13
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:16,080
Yes they do Dr. Starr.

14
00:03:16,145 --> 00:03:17,915
Er, Doctor Rutherford

15
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,284
- Lionel Rutherford.

16
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:23,392
Ah, er, I understood

17
00:03:23,456 --> 00:03:26,294
that Dr. Starr was head of this institution.

18
00:03:26,357 --> 00:03:28,597
I'm Dr. Starr's associate.

19
00:03:28,662 --> 00:03:30,931
Sit down. Sit down.

20
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:33,933
You advertised for a Senior Houseman.

21
00:03:33,998 --> 00:03:35,133
I sent along my credentials

22
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,602
and Dr. Starr asked me

23
00:03:36,668 --> 00:03:37,703
to come along for an interview.

24
00:03:37,768 --> 00:03:40,074
I've read your report.

25
00:03:40,138 --> 00:03:43,643
But it doesn't tell me what I need to know.

26
00:03:43,707 --> 00:03:47,147
Your background qualifies you to set up a fashionable

27
00:03:47,212 --> 00:03:50,552
psychiatric practice to

28
00:03:50,616 --> 00:03:52,853
hold wealthy old ladies by the hand

29
00:03:52,918 --> 00:03:57,160
while they tell you about their horrible husbands.

30
00:03:57,222 --> 00:03:59,694
But we're a long way from Harley Street

31
00:03:59,758 --> 00:04:02,829
out here.

32
00:04:02,893 --> 00:04:06,201
This is an asylum

33
00:04:06,264 --> 00:04:10,973
for the incurably insane.

34
00:04:11,036 --> 00:04:15,512
You want to know the most useful thing here?

35
00:04:15,574 --> 00:04:17,879
This: the control system

36
00:04:17,944 --> 00:04:18,979
for the door upstairs.

37
00:04:19,045 --> 00:04:20,481
No keys just, uh,

38
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:23,019
an electrical device.

39
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:26,656
The door can't be opened from either side

40
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,991
unless I press that button,

41
00:04:29,056 --> 00:04:30,159
If you're trying to warn me

42
00:04:30,225 --> 00:04:31,793
that some of the inmates are potentially dangerous

43
00:04:31,858 --> 00:04:33,294
you needn't worry.

44
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,131
I've dealt with disturbed patients during my training.

45
00:04:36,195 --> 00:04:38,268
By what methods?

46
00:04:38,334 --> 00:04:41,036
Kindness. Understanding. Insight.

47
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,538
Exactly my ways

48
00:04:42,604 --> 00:04:45,206
twenty years ago,

49
00:04:45,271 --> 00:04:47,676
Now I'm not so sure.

50
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:49,745
Those poor devils up there can't be cured.

51
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,381
They can only be confined

52
00:04:51,446 --> 00:04:53,415
and kept from being dangerous.

53
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,587
Is that Dr. Starr's outlook too?

54
00:04:57,649 --> 00:05:01,058
Doctor Starr is upstairs now.

55
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:03,192
What - with a patient?

56
00:05:03,258 --> 00:05:07,868
Doctor Starr IS a patient.

57
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,567
Doctor Starr attacked me a few days ago

58
00:05:10,632 --> 00:05:13,138
- suddenly, without warning.

59
00:05:13,203 --> 00:05:16,943
That's how I injured my leg.

60
00:05:17,006 --> 00:05:19,745
Yes.

61
00:05:19,809 --> 00:05:22,213
Working with the mentally disturbed

62
00:05:22,278 --> 00:05:25,751
can lead to a breakdown.

63
00:05:25,814 --> 00:05:26,649
The nurse and orderly

64
00:05:26,715 --> 00:05:29,422
managed to transfer Dr. Starr upstairs

65
00:05:29,486 --> 00:05:31,089
with the other patients.

66
00:05:31,154 --> 00:05:32,823
But I can't go there.

67
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,995
The orderly gives me reports.

68
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,433
He says the doctor is perfectly rational now

69
00:05:40,495 --> 00:05:43,201
except for one thing:

70
00:05:43,265 --> 00:05:45,035
a new personality

71
00:05:45,101 --> 00:05:47,871
seems to have taken over

72
00:05:47,935 --> 00:05:49,239
with its own name

73
00:05:49,305 --> 00:05:51,041
and its own life story.

74
00:05:51,106 --> 00:05:53,311
Hysterical fugue?

75
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:56,115
Meaningless label don't you think?

76
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,151
It describes something that exists.

77
00:05:59,215 --> 00:06:02,222
From time to time a man disappears

78
00:06:02,286 --> 00:06:03,589
and is discovered much later

79
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:04,890
living in a different town

80
00:06:04,956 --> 00:06:05,857
under a different name

81
00:06:05,924 --> 00:06:07,560
following a different occupation

82
00:06:07,626 --> 00:06:09,830
because something happened in his earlier life

83
00:06:09,894 --> 00:06:11,932
that made it completely intolerable.

84
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,599
Do you believe you could

85
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:16,368
recognize such a case?

86
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:17,602
I'm certain of it.

87
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,304
Very well.

88
00:06:19,371 --> 00:06:21,707
We'll call it a test.

89
00:06:21,772 --> 00:06:23,877
There are several patients upstairs

90
00:06:23,942 --> 00:06:28,884
with the sort of condition you described.

91
00:06:28,946 --> 00:06:29,880
Go up there.

92
00:06:29,946 --> 00:06:31,583
Talk to them.

93
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:33,285
If you can recognize

94
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,856
who is, or was, Dr. Starr

95
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:39,758
then I'll consider you qualified for the position.

96
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,563
I will recognize him.

97
00:06:43,628 --> 00:06:45,866
Him?

98
00:06:45,931 --> 00:06:48,872
How do you know the doctor's a man?

99
00:07:02,648 --> 00:07:03,516
Reynolds?

100
00:07:03,584 --> 00:07:04,986
Yes doctor?

101
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:06,019
Reynolds

102
00:07:06,085 --> 00:07:06,952
Yes?

103
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:09,624
I am sending a young man upstairs.

104
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:10,592
Martin.

105
00:07:10,658 --> 00:07:13,028
- Dr. Martin.

106
00:07:13,092 --> 00:07:14,729
Now listen to me carefully.

107
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:26,104
(Door buzzer)

108
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,735
Doctor Martin?

109
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,804
I'm Max Reynolds - the Orderly.

110
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,004
I'm pleased to meet you.

111
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,439
Come this way.

112
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:37,979
It keeps out the draft as

113
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:40,180
Dr. Starr used to say.

114
00:09:40,245 --> 00:09:41,916
You know why I'm here?

115
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:44,386
Doctor Rutherford gave me full instructions.

116
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,588
What can you tell me about the doctor?

117
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:49,158
Who? Rutherford?

118
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:50,723
Starr.

119
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:52,158
Nothing.

120
00:09:52,223 --> 00:09:55,563
You're to be given full co-operation but no clues.

121
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,198
Are all these rooms occupied?

122
00:09:59,264 --> 00:10:02,537
Yes. We keep them locked of course.

123
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:04,571
A security measure.

124
00:10:04,636 --> 00:10:07,777
- And this one? 
- (anxious) It's my office.

125
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:10,214
Aren't the patients free to move around at all?

126
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:11,513
They're not too badly off.

127
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:12,948
You'll see for yourself.

128
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:13,814
First patient?

129
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,516
Mm-hmm.

130
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,453
Name?

131
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:19,591
She calls herself 'Bonnie'.

132
00:10:19,655 --> 00:10:21,123
'B Starr'.

133
00:10:21,189 --> 00:10:23,928
That's a question for you to decide.

134
00:10:24,726 --> 00:10:32,475
(Humming)

135
00:10:32,534 --> 00:10:34,671
(Knock on Door)

136
00:10:36,772 --> 00:10:39,210
Look Bonnie?

137
00:10:39,275 --> 00:10:42,045
Bonnie. Come along.

138
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,280
Here's Dr. Martin to see you.

139
00:10:48,818 --> 00:10:50,985
Leave me alone.

140
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,920
I was hoping I could talk to you.

141
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,256
Talk?

142
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:58,697
That's all you people ever do is talk.

143
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,132
Nobody listens.

144
00:11:01,196 --> 00:11:04,570
I listen too.

145
00:11:04,634 --> 00:11:06,571
You wouldn't believe me.

146
00:11:06,636 --> 00:11:12,115
Perhaps not but I am willing to listen.

147
00:11:12,177 --> 00:11:14,779
Oh, well,

148
00:11:14,844 --> 00:11:17,384
if it makes any difference -

149
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:25,458
I hope to God we get to the airport on time.

150
00:11:25,522 --> 00:11:26,823
For the last time Walter

151
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:28,592
there's nothing to worry about.

152
00:11:28,658 --> 00:11:29,960
Did it arrive?

153
00:11:30,026 --> 00:11:30,794
Yes it's here.

154
00:11:30,861 --> 00:11:32,796
They finished installing it about an hour ago.

155
00:11:32,861 --> 00:11:34,564
We have nothing to worry about.

156
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,865
That's easy enough for you to say Bonnie

157
00:11:35,931 --> 00:11:37,835
but supposing something goes wrong?

158
00:11:37,901 --> 00:11:38,636
It can't go wrong.

159
00:11:38,702 --> 00:11:40,371
Not if you follow the plan.

160
00:11:40,436 --> 00:11:42,072
I'll follow it.

161
00:11:42,138 --> 00:11:44,708
If only I could see you first.

162
00:11:44,773 --> 00:11:47,380
You'll see me soon enough.

163
00:11:47,444 --> 00:11:49,683
I'll be waiting for you once it's over.

164
00:11:49,748 --> 00:11:51,382
I'll ring you.

165
00:12:36,094 --> 00:12:38,198
(Door slamming)

166
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:43,672
Walter?

167
00:12:43,737 --> 00:12:45,440
You're home early.

168
00:12:45,505 --> 00:12:48,378
I, uh, didn't get in to town today,

169
00:12:48,443 --> 00:12:50,078
But you did get into the brandy.

170
00:12:50,143 --> 00:12:52,149
This happens to be my first drink.

171
00:12:52,213 --> 00:12:54,150
Not you're last I'm sure.

172
00:12:54,215 --> 00:12:55,884
Can I fix you one?

173
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,521
Yes please.

174
00:12:58,585 --> 00:13:00,221
How did your class go?

175
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,690
It's not a class.

176
00:13:01,756 --> 00:13:04,228
Professor Kalanga is a spiritual leader.

177
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:06,697
'Professor'! Back in Africa

178
00:13:06,762 --> 00:13:08,130
he'd be just another witch doctor.

179
00:13:08,195 --> 00:13:09,697
What do you know about it?

180
00:13:09,763 --> 00:13:12,435
Don't forget I lived there for years.

181
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,701
After all my father was...

182
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:17,475
[interrupts wearily] 'Governor General of the colony'.

183
00:13:17,537 --> 00:13:19,141
It's a good thing he can't see his daughter now.

184
00:13:19,206 --> 00:13:21,611
The poor old boy'd turn in his grave.

185
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:24,948
Taking voodoo lessons from a black charlatan.

186
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:28,385
It is not voodoo.

187
00:13:28,448 --> 00:13:31,421
There are natural forces which are stronger than,

188
00:13:31,486 --> 00:13:34,192
than life or death -

189
00:13:34,256 --> 00:13:36,761
forces which modern civilized man has forgotten.

190
00:13:36,826 --> 00:13:40,767
I wish you'd forget all this mumbo jumbo.

191
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,534
What's that?

192
00:13:43,598 --> 00:13:46,571
It's called Anawanga.

193
00:13:46,635 --> 00:13:47,904
I think it's revolting.

194
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,571
It's not supposed to be pretty.

195
00:13:49,638 --> 00:13:54,448
The serpent is a symbol of the life force.

196
00:13:54,512 --> 00:13:56,282
And the teeth

197
00:13:56,347 --> 00:13:58,185
are to protect one from evil.

198
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,487
There's no evil in your life.

199
00:14:00,552 --> 00:14:03,322
Oh but there is.

200
00:14:03,386 --> 00:14:05,456
What do you mean?

201
00:14:05,522 --> 00:14:06,826
Bonnie.

202
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,294
That's all over and done with.

203
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,129
I swear it.

204
00:14:14,194 --> 00:14:14,996
Only last month

205
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:18,035
you came and asked me for a divorce.

206
00:14:18,099 --> 00:14:19,469
I haven't seen her since.

207
00:14:19,535 --> 00:14:21,675
You have my word on that.

208
00:14:21,739 --> 00:14:23,509
I'm glad you haven't

209
00:14:23,574 --> 00:14:24,842
 - because I told you then

210
00:14:24,908 --> 00:14:26,510
and I'm telling you now:

211
00:14:26,576 --> 00:14:29,751
there won't be any divorce.

212
00:14:32,585 --> 00:14:34,922
Oh I know you Walter.

213
00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:36,690
You're a weak, vain,

214
00:14:36,755 --> 00:14:38,992
selfish opportunist.

215
00:14:39,057 --> 00:14:41,895
You're content to live off my money.

216
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:45,634
But you ARE mine

217
00:14:45,697 --> 00:14:47,868
and I will never let you go.

218
00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:50,235
(whispers) Never.

219
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,307
Now you do understand that don't you?

220
00:14:53,372 --> 00:14:54,805
Perfectly.

221
00:15:04,215 --> 00:15:07,554
Darling

222
00:15:07,618 --> 00:15:09,088
- I've got a present for you.

223
00:15:09,153 --> 00:15:12,126
Oh? What is it?

224
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,328
You'll see.

225
00:15:16,229 --> 00:15:17,532
Come along with me.

226
00:15:21,336 --> 00:15:22,971
I don't see anything,

227
00:15:23,037 --> 00:15:24,440
Downstairs.

228
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,743
In the basement?

229
00:15:26,807 --> 00:15:28,809
After you.

230
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,378
Careful now. Mind the steps.

231
00:15:34,714 --> 00:15:38,557
Well? What is it?

232
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,592
Oh darling.

233
00:15:41,656 --> 00:15:45,262
It's a freezer!

234
00:15:45,325 --> 00:15:47,062
D'you like it?

235
00:15:47,127 --> 00:15:49,096
Oh you know I've always wanted one.

236
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:51,200
What a lovely surprise.

237
00:15:51,265 --> 00:15:52,967
I have another one for you.

238
00:15:53,034 --> 00:15:53,834
What is it?

239
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,169
This!

240
00:15:56,234 --> 00:15:57,905
(Scream)

241
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:22,370
(Chopping sound in basement)

242
00:18:13,213 --> 00:18:15,717
(Doorbell)

243
00:19:44,575 --> 00:19:47,045
Rest in pieces.

244
00:19:55,452 --> 00:19:59,424
(Phone ringing)

245
00:20:02,392 --> 00:20:03,361
Yes?

246
00:20:03,427 --> 00:20:05,231
It's finished.

247
00:20:05,296 --> 00:20:07,565
Good. Are you all right?

248
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:10,435
Yeah. How soon can you get here?

249
00:20:10,499 --> 00:20:11,368
I'm just packing.

250
00:20:11,434 --> 00:20:13,271
I should be there within the hour.

251
00:20:13,336 --> 00:20:16,110
I'll be ready.

252
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:18,780
One more thing Walter.

253
00:20:18,845 --> 00:20:20,615
We'll have to take her along.

254
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:22,381
(horrified) Why? There's no need for that.

255
00:20:22,447 --> 00:20:24,251
No one's going to check up when we're away.

256
00:20:24,317 --> 00:20:26,588
It will be safer if there's nothing left behind.

257
00:20:26,653 --> 00:20:29,290
They may still suspect but they'll have no proof.

258
00:20:29,355 --> 00:20:30,655
We'll dispose of the evidence

259
00:20:30,721 --> 00:20:32,394
on the way to the airport.

260
00:20:32,459 --> 00:20:33,793
Look we can't talk about it on the phone.

261
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:35,327
We'll talk when you're here.

262
00:20:35,392 --> 00:20:37,799
But for God's sake don't let anyone see you.

263
00:20:37,864 --> 00:20:39,335
I'll bring my car around to the back.

264
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,702
Now keep the kitchen door unlocked

265
00:20:40,768 --> 00:20:42,269
so I won't have to knock.

266
00:20:42,334 --> 00:20:43,671
All right but hurry.

267
00:20:43,737 --> 00:20:45,208
The sooner we're out of here the better.

268
00:20:45,273 --> 00:20:46,240
I'll be right there.

269
00:20:46,306 --> 00:20:47,975
I'll be waiting,

270
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,893
(Something coming
up from the basement)

271
00:22:34,084 --> 00:22:37,021
(Door creaking)

272
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:36,320
(Gasping)

273
00:24:03,378 --> 00:24:04,881
Walter?

274
00:24:14,822 --> 00:24:16,459
Walter?

275
00:24:17,792 --> 00:24:20,797
(Door creaking)

276
00:24:44,854 --> 00:24:46,822
Walter?

277
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,949
Walter?

278
00:25:42,213 --> 00:25:44,085
(Gasp)

279
00:25:55,126 --> 00:25:56,995
(Scream)

280
00:26:41,405 --> 00:26:42,979
(Scream)

281
00:28:15,139 --> 00:28:19,279
(Screaming)

282
00:28:24,879 --> 00:28:27,687
They found me lying there the next morning,

283
00:28:27,752 --> 00:28:31,624
They said I'd strangled Walter.

284
00:28:31,687 --> 00:28:34,728
I tried to tell them about Ruth

285
00:28:34,792 --> 00:28:37,327
and the hand,

286
00:28:37,392 --> 00:28:40,934
but it was gone.

287
00:28:40,997 --> 00:28:44,473
Everything was gone.

288
00:28:46,604 --> 00:28:51,881
But the hand WAS on my face.

289
00:28:51,944 --> 00:28:55,452
I chopped,

290
00:28:55,515 --> 00:28:58,988
and chopped,

291
00:28:59,051 --> 00:29:03,024
and chopped at it.

292
00:29:10,863 --> 00:29:12,268
Now do you believe me?

293
00:29:13,266 --> 00:29:16,940
No?

294
00:29:17,003 --> 00:29:20,377
(Chuckles)

295
00:29:21,008 --> 00:29:25,749
(Humming)

296
00:29:25,811 --> 00:29:28,147
Paranoid psychosis.

297
00:29:28,212 --> 00:29:31,152
How did she come to the asylum?

298
00:29:31,216 --> 00:29:32,687
She could of come as a doctor.

299
00:29:32,752 --> 00:29:34,156
And the wife?

300
00:29:34,222 --> 00:29:35,558
You'll learn the real case histories

301
00:29:35,624 --> 00:29:38,426
when you've made your choice.

302
00:29:38,491 --> 00:29:41,332
That's the service lift from the kitchen.

303
00:29:42,596 --> 00:29:43,732
The next patient?

304
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:44,833
His name is Bruno.

305
00:29:47,835 --> 00:29:50,106
Bruno

306
00:29:50,172 --> 00:29:51,805
- this is Dr. Martin.

307
00:30:03,352 --> 00:30:05,687
What are you making?

308
00:30:05,753 --> 00:30:08,558
Whatever you like.

309
00:30:08,622 --> 00:30:11,295
Could it be a surgical gown?

310
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:15,601
I can make whatever you wish.

311
00:30:15,664 --> 00:30:21,775
It could be a surgical gown

312
00:30:21,836 --> 00:30:23,773
or a shroud.

313
00:30:28,211 --> 00:30:31,315
I'm a tailor.

314
00:30:31,379 --> 00:30:36,590
Doctors can sew - stitch.

315
00:30:36,651 --> 00:30:42,466
Always been a tailor.

316
00:30:42,526 --> 00:30:44,061
Always.

317
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:00,946
(Door chime)

318
00:31:02,947 --> 00:31:07,588
Oh Mr. Stebbins. Good evening.

319
00:31:07,651 --> 00:31:10,622
It's the first of the month.

320
00:31:10,686 --> 00:31:13,759
The rent is due.

321
00:31:13,823 --> 00:31:14,958
Mr. Stebbins

322
00:31:15,024 --> 00:31:17,296
I got a wonderful idea.

323
00:31:17,361 --> 00:31:18,428
Have you got the rent?

324
00:31:18,494 --> 00:31:20,235
Every month you come here

325
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,839
and always you are wearing the same suit.

326
00:31:23,903 --> 00:31:25,338
There's nothing wrong with my suit.

327
00:31:25,404 --> 00:31:26,272
It gives me good wear.

328
00:31:26,338 --> 00:31:27,707
Ah, wear, yes,

329
00:31:27,773 --> 00:31:30,511
but style, no.

330
00:31:30,575 --> 00:31:32,011
Now listen.

331
00:31:32,077 --> 00:31:33,747
For one month's rent

332
00:31:33,813 --> 00:31:36,819
I could make for you SUCH a suit!

333
00:31:36,883 --> 00:31:38,417
I don't need a suit.

334
00:31:38,483 --> 00:31:41,088
And if I did I wouldn't get it from you.

335
00:31:47,493 --> 00:31:49,096
I haven't got it.

336
00:31:49,162 --> 00:31:50,129
Now see here.

337
00:31:50,194 --> 00:31:51,094
No, no, no.

338
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:53,667
You, you see HERE Mr. Stebbins.

339
00:31:53,731 --> 00:31:56,103
You see this shop. 

340
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:58,338
People, people - fine people

341
00:31:58,403 --> 00:31:59,671
used to come here

342
00:31:59,737 --> 00:32:02,077
for fine tailoring.

343
00:32:02,142 --> 00:32:04,444
Now a little pressing,

344
00:32:04,509 --> 00:32:05,577
a little mending,

345
00:32:05,644 --> 00:32:07,080
that's all I get.

346
00:32:07,146 --> 00:32:09,082
I will pay your rent

347
00:32:09,148 --> 00:32:12,624
but you must give me a little more time.

348
00:32:12,687 --> 00:32:14,123
I'll tell you what

349
00:32:14,189 --> 00:32:16,492
- today's Monday right?

350
00:32:16,556 --> 00:32:18,795
I'll be back here on Saturday morning.

351
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,263
(groans) Saturday morning!

352
00:32:20,328 --> 00:32:21,361
Bright and early

353
00:32:21,427 --> 00:32:23,599
and if you haven't got the rent

354
00:32:23,665 --> 00:32:25,735
you can start packing.

355
00:32:30,804 --> 00:32:33,710
No tricks now.

356
00:32:33,774 --> 00:32:36,146
(sighs) No tricks!

357
00:32:39,281 --> 00:32:40,617
You're supper. It's ready.

358
00:32:40,683 --> 00:32:43,554
I'm not hungry.

359
00:32:43,618 --> 00:32:45,720
Something's wrong?

360
00:32:49,189 --> 00:32:53,431
Not 'something' Anna - everything.

361
00:32:53,494 --> 00:32:56,369
Mr. Stebbins was here.

362
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:58,300
He's giving us one week.

363
00:32:58,365 --> 00:33:00,470
A man works hard all his life

364
00:33:00,535 --> 00:33:03,942
and then - in one week!

365
00:33:04,006 --> 00:33:05,878
Where can we go?

366
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:08,547
(Door chime)

367
00:33:12,781 --> 00:33:13,882
Good evening.

368
00:33:13,948 --> 00:33:16,054
Is the proprietor in?

369
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:23,928
I am the proprietor.

370
00:33:37,674 --> 00:33:40,078
Go have your supper.

371
00:33:43,211 --> 00:33:48,057
Now what can I do for you Mr. uh?

372
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:50,188
Smith.

373
00:33:50,254 --> 00:33:51,823
Am I correct in assuming

374
00:33:51,888 --> 00:33:53,759
that you can tailor a garment

375
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:56,861
from any material of my own selection?

376
00:33:56,925 --> 00:34:00,200
You want I should make you a suit?

377
00:34:00,265 --> 00:34:02,070
Exactly.

378
00:34:02,135 --> 00:34:05,138
I have a fine stock of woollens here.

379
00:34:05,203 --> 00:34:07,807
That will not be necessary.

380
00:34:09,041 --> 00:34:11,946
I brought my own material.

381
00:34:12,012 --> 00:34:13,780
I see.

382
00:34:13,846 --> 00:34:17,551
You will be wanting something special.

383
00:34:17,615 --> 00:34:19,886
Correct -

384
00:34:19,951 --> 00:34:24,995
something very special.

385
00:34:25,057 --> 00:34:27,760
There's enough here for a suit I believe.

386
00:34:27,825 --> 00:34:29,995
Unusual.

387
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:33,833
Special.

388
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:35,168
It will be difficult

389
00:34:35,234 --> 00:34:38,071
to work from such a fabric

390
00:34:38,136 --> 00:34:41,577
but I can promise you a suit.

391
00:34:41,641 --> 00:34:43,710
Now if you will just slip off my coat

392
00:34:43,775 --> 00:34:45,679
so I can make measure.

393
00:34:45,745 --> 00:34:47,916
The suit is not for me.

394
00:34:47,981 --> 00:34:49,482
It is for my son.

395
00:34:49,548 --> 00:34:50,951
Ah, yes,

396
00:34:51,018 --> 00:34:53,990
when will he come in for a fitting?

397
00:34:54,054 --> 00:34:55,590
It's to be a surprise.

398
00:34:55,657 --> 00:34:57,891
Oh, a present.

399
00:34:57,957 --> 00:35:00,464
You might call it that.

400
00:35:00,529 --> 00:35:04,300
I have written down all the measurements

401
00:35:04,363 --> 00:35:08,274
and made various diagrams of the style.

402
00:35:13,107 --> 00:35:14,741
Expensive.

403
00:35:14,807 --> 00:35:16,511
Then you'll have to charge me accordingly.

404
00:35:16,577 --> 00:35:20,417
Shall we say two hundred pounds?

405
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,454
Two hundred?!

406
00:35:24,517 --> 00:35:26,286
I will begin immediately.

407
00:35:26,351 --> 00:35:29,325
No. This schedule.

408
00:35:29,389 --> 00:35:31,393
It is of the greatest importance

409
00:35:31,459 --> 00:35:32,930
that you work on the suit

410
00:35:32,995 --> 00:35:36,867
only during the hours listed here.

411
00:35:39,167 --> 00:35:41,238
But these times,

412
00:35:41,303 --> 00:35:43,941
they're all past midnight.

413
00:35:44,006 --> 00:35:46,445
I happen to believe in astrology.

414
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,844
The stars?

415
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,415
I take it you are not a believer?

416
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,387
No matter. All that concerns you

417
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:56,955
is following these instructions to the letter.

418
00:35:57,019 --> 00:35:59,760
There must be no mistake. Is that clear?

419
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,692
NO mistake.

420
00:36:01,757 --> 00:36:05,062
Everything will be as you wish.

421
00:36:05,126 --> 00:36:06,729
I swear.

422
00:36:06,794 --> 00:36:07,998
You'll find my address

423
00:36:08,063 --> 00:36:10,500
written on top of the first sheet.

424
00:36:10,565 --> 00:36:12,401
When may I have delivery?

425
00:36:12,466 --> 00:36:15,842
Um, today is Monday. Er,

426
00:36:15,905 --> 00:36:18,744
and if I start tonight

427
00:36:18,807 --> 00:36:20,143
- yeah, so:

428
00:36:20,209 --> 00:36:23,984
I can bring you the suit on Friday.

429
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:25,518
Excellent.

430
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:28,421
I shall expect you the moment it is finished.

431
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:37,798
Remember - my instructions.

432
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:40,268
Oh I promise.

433
00:36:40,332 --> 00:36:41,401
Goodnight.

434
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:59,486
Bruno? Who was that man?

435
00:36:59,549 --> 00:37:00,819
A customer.

436
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,854
He ordered a suit.

437
00:37:02,919 --> 00:37:06,460
Two hundred pounds he will pay!

438
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:08,462
Bruno I'm afraid.

439
00:37:08,527 --> 00:37:10,095
There is something not right in all this -

440
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:12,900
something that will make you trouble.

441
00:37:12,963 --> 00:37:15,135
I must do it.

442
00:38:15,331 --> 00:38:17,266
Ow!

443
00:38:19,666 --> 00:38:21,271
What is it?

444
00:38:24,106 --> 00:38:25,740
The instructions said

445
00:38:25,807 --> 00:38:29,480
to work to five o'clock only.

446
00:38:29,543 --> 00:38:32,417
I tried to work a little longer.

447
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:14,660
It is finished?

448
00:39:14,726 --> 00:39:15,793
Hmm.

449
00:39:15,859 --> 00:39:18,431
I'm the one who's finished:

450
00:39:18,495 --> 00:39:21,902
four nights, nothing but work

451
00:39:21,965 --> 00:39:26,373
from midnight until just before dawn.

452
00:39:26,436 --> 00:39:28,339
Ah, now is done.

453
00:39:28,405 --> 00:39:29,542
May I see it?

454
00:39:29,607 --> 00:39:31,177
Mmm.

455
00:39:35,947 --> 00:39:38,483
It is strange.

456
00:39:38,548 --> 00:39:39,883
You're going to press it?

457
00:39:39,949 --> 00:39:42,990
No, no. Mr. Smith doesn't want it pressed.

458
00:39:43,054 --> 00:39:44,490
Then what will you do?

459
00:39:44,556 --> 00:39:47,827
Deliver it. Just as he said. Right now.

460
00:40:42,049 --> 00:40:44,722
(Door bell)

461
00:40:57,097 --> 00:40:58,802
At last.

462
00:40:58,866 --> 00:41:00,869
Did you bring it?

463
00:41:00,935 --> 00:41:02,204
Ah good.

464
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:04,107
Come in, come in.

465
00:41:15,818 --> 00:41:17,053
This way.

466
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:24,459
Here now there are two steps down.

467
00:41:30,935 --> 00:41:34,275
In here.

468
00:41:34,339 --> 00:41:36,074
My study.

469
00:41:46,316 --> 00:41:47,683
The suit is completed?

470
00:41:47,748 --> 00:41:49,220
Oh yes.

471
00:41:49,285 --> 00:41:53,392
It was difficult working with such material

472
00:41:53,455 --> 00:41:55,294
and at night only.

473
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:56,828
But you followed the instructions?

474
00:41:56,893 --> 00:41:59,831
Just as you ordered.

475
00:41:59,895 --> 00:42:02,132
Splendid.

476
00:42:02,197 --> 00:42:04,702
You have no idea how much this means to me

477
00:42:04,766 --> 00:42:06,270
and to my son.

478
00:42:06,335 --> 00:42:08,306
Ah yes. You're son.

479
00:42:08,372 --> 00:42:10,944
Where is he?

480
00:42:11,009 --> 00:42:13,913
Never mind. Now if I may see the suit?

481
00:42:13,978 --> 00:42:15,947
Uh,

482
00:42:16,012 --> 00:42:18,283
Oh yes of course. Your fee.

483
00:42:18,348 --> 00:42:19,650
Just send me your account

484
00:42:19,716 --> 00:42:20,918
and I’'ll take care of it.

485
00:42:20,984 --> 00:42:23,692
I must have the money first.

486
00:42:23,756 --> 00:42:27,095
I have bills to pay.

487
00:42:27,159 --> 00:42:30,730
You wouldn't understand. You're rich.

488
00:42:30,793 --> 00:42:32,298
On the contrary

489
00:42:32,363 --> 00:42:35,204
I understand the situation only too well.

490
00:42:35,267 --> 00:42:37,472
It so happens at the moment

491
00:42:37,537 --> 00:42:40,441
I'm in the same financial position as yourself.

492
00:42:40,506 --> 00:42:42,175
You?

493
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,212
Don't misunderstand.

494
00:42:44,277 --> 00:42:45,412
In a very short while

495
00:42:45,478 --> 00:42:47,982
I shall be in funds again.

496
00:42:48,047 --> 00:42:51,685
Just as soon as my son returns.

497
00:42:51,749 --> 00:42:54,354
You're diamond!

498
00:42:54,419 --> 00:42:57,025
This?

499
00:42:57,089 --> 00:43:00,595
Fake.

500
00:43:00,659 --> 00:43:01,994
It was real once

501
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,764
but I had to dispose of it

502
00:43:03,829 --> 00:43:06,868
in order to continue my work -

503
00:43:06,932 --> 00:43:08,768
my studies.

504
00:43:08,832 --> 00:43:10,971
This book now.

505
00:43:14,475 --> 00:43:18,449
It's very old, very rare.

506
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:22,185
The only one of its kind left in the world.

507
00:43:22,248 --> 00:43:24,420
It cost me my fortune.

508
00:43:24,485 --> 00:43:27,758
You gave all your money for a book?

509
00:43:27,822 --> 00:43:30,026
To the penny.

510
00:43:30,092 --> 00:43:33,396
But I needed it because of my son.

511
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:37,668
I sold everything to buy it.

512
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:39,534
You're lying.

513
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,070
See for yourself.

514
00:43:41,135 --> 00:43:44,540
There is nothing left.

515
00:43:44,604 --> 00:43:47,176
What is in that room?

516
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:50,411
That room is empty too.

517
00:43:50,476 --> 00:43:52,980
There is nothing in there I tell you. Please.

518
00:44:09,834 --> 00:44:13,105
So that's it.

519
00:44:13,169 --> 00:44:17,076
You're a murderer!

520
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:21,549
No. I'm no murderer.

521
00:44:21,612 --> 00:44:24,652
He died a natural death.

522
00:44:24,716 --> 00:44:27,318
I knew a long time ago

523
00:44:27,383 --> 00:44:32,091
that it was inevitable.

524
00:44:32,155 --> 00:44:33,991
Can't you see?

525
00:44:34,056 --> 00:44:36,762
This is my son.

526
00:44:41,164 --> 00:44:42,999
Your son?

527
00:44:43,064 --> 00:44:44,835
He was the one I was working for

528
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,535
- planning for.

529
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:48,674
The book told me what to do.

530
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:50,777
That's why I had you make the suit.

531
00:44:50,841 --> 00:44:53,445
It is for him.

532
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:56,482
Give it to me.

533
00:44:56,547 --> 00:45:00,789
No. First the money.

534
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:11,432
You can't stop me now.

535
00:45:11,496 --> 00:45:14,334
No one can stop me now.

536
00:45:17,602 --> 00:45:19,771
Give me that suit.

537
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,912
(Door chime)

538
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:41,225
You sold the suit?

539
00:46:41,289 --> 00:46:42,890
No.

540
00:46:42,955 --> 00:46:45,430
Mr. Stebbins phoned just after you left.

541
00:46:45,494 --> 00:46:46,530
He said to remind you

542
00:46:46,596 --> 00:46:48,631
he was coming for his rent in the morning.

543
00:46:48,696 --> 00:46:49,967
I told him it was all right:

544
00:46:50,033 --> 00:46:51,033
you were collecting money

545
00:46:51,101 --> 00:46:52,336
from a customer tonight.

546
00:46:52,402 --> 00:46:53,736
You told him!?

547
00:46:53,802 --> 00:46:55,906
Oh Anna! I asked you not to say

548
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:58,241
a word about this to anyone.

549
00:46:58,306 --> 00:47:00,512
Burn, burn, burn it.

550
00:47:00,576 --> 00:47:03,447
Put it in the stove and burn it.

551
00:47:03,511 --> 00:47:05,248
Forget about the suit.

552
00:47:05,313 --> 00:47:07,083
Forget I ever made the suit.

553
00:47:07,149 --> 00:47:10,087
Forget about Mr. Smith. Forget everything.

554
00:47:10,151 --> 00:47:12,389
Burn it.

555
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:20,965
A fortune he said.

556
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:03,374
No fire.

557
00:48:09,348 --> 00:48:11,250
(Anna's voice) I don't know what we will do now.

558
00:48:11,315 --> 00:48:13,117
But when people see how you look

559
00:48:13,183 --> 00:48:15,288
perhaps they will come in.

560
00:48:24,197 --> 00:48:26,866
I told you to burn the suit.

561
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:28,534
I put it on Otto.

562
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,671
Otto?

563
00:48:29,737 --> 00:48:32,309
I made a name for him.

564
00:48:32,374 --> 00:48:34,677
I talk to him often when I am alone.

565
00:48:34,741 --> 00:48:38,047
Anna please. Burn the suit.

566
00:48:38,111 --> 00:48:39,312
I thought...

567
00:48:39,378 --> 00:48:42,784
No one must ever know it existed.

568
00:48:42,847 --> 00:48:44,249
Mr. Smith knows.

569
00:48:44,315 --> 00:48:46,620
Mr. Smith is dead.

570
00:48:46,684 --> 00:48:49,857
Dead?

571
00:48:49,922 --> 00:48:52,593
I killed him.

572
00:48:52,657 --> 00:48:53,961
It was an accident

573
00:48:54,027 --> 00:48:57,096
but no one will believe that.

574
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,999
What is that book?

575
00:48:59,064 --> 00:49:01,402
Mr. Smith had it.

576
00:49:01,467 --> 00:49:03,472
It is a book of magic.

577
00:49:03,538 --> 00:49:06,709
There are spells for making the suit.

578
00:49:06,773 --> 00:49:10,080
The book too must be burned.

579
00:49:10,144 --> 00:49:11,748
No.

580
00:49:11,814 --> 00:49:13,016
What do you mean?

581
00:49:13,081 --> 00:49:14,117
Don't you see?

582
00:49:14,184 --> 00:49:16,453
If you have the book you can show it to the police

583
00:49:16,519 --> 00:49:17,920
- tell them what happened.

584
00:49:17,985 --> 00:49:19,822
Then they will believe you speak the truth.

585
00:49:19,887 --> 00:49:21,992
What do you know from the police?

586
00:49:22,057 --> 00:49:23,493
Bruno please - for my sake.

587
00:49:23,559 --> 00:49:24,761
Tell them what happened!

588
00:49:24,827 --> 00:49:26,061
No.

589
00:49:26,127 --> 00:49:27,263
Then I tell them.

590
00:49:27,329 --> 00:49:29,099
We cannot live with murder on our souls!

591
00:49:29,164 --> 00:49:31,635
Anna - no. No!

592
00:49:31,699 --> 00:49:33,725
(Anna) Oh help! (Bruno) Anna! (Anna) Help!

593
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:34,999
(Bruno) No!

594
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,250
Let go of me Bruno!

595
00:49:59,194 --> 00:50:01,231
No Anna!

596
00:50:01,296 --> 00:50:02,731
(Scream) Otto!

597
00:50:02,797 --> 00:50:05,273
Ott - aaaahh!

598
00:50:12,508 --> 00:50:14,780
You must find him.

599
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:17,416
Somewhere in the city

600
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:19,985
he is alive.

601
00:50:20,049 --> 00:50:23,422
I tell you he is alive!

602
00:50:34,263 --> 00:50:36,102
How did it happen?

603
00:50:36,168 --> 00:50:38,737
You know I can't tell you. Not yet.

604
00:50:38,801 --> 00:50:41,071
Not until I've made my choice.

605
00:50:41,136 --> 00:50:44,109
Doctor Rutherford's orders.

606
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:47,482
All right. Who's next?

607
00:50:47,546 --> 00:50:49,149
A strange case.

608
00:50:49,214 --> 00:50:52,420
A very strange case.

609
00:50:52,483 --> 00:50:53,418
Her name is Barbara.

610
00:50:54,919 --> 00:50:56,857
(Knock on Door)

611
00:50:58,059 --> 00:50:59,427
Oh how good of you to come!

612
00:50:59,492 --> 00:51:01,796
You're a lawyer aren't you?

613
00:51:01,861 --> 00:51:04,632
No I'm sorry I'm afraid not.

614
00:51:04,696 --> 00:51:06,199
But I asked to see a lawyer.

615
00:51:06,265 --> 00:51:07,768
I told you to send for one!

616
00:51:07,833 --> 00:51:11,106
This is Dr. Martin.

617
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:13,608
Another doctor?

618
00:51:13,673 --> 00:51:16,209
But I'm not ill. You can see that.

619
00:51:16,274 --> 00:51:18,146
A good lawyer would know that it wasn't my fault.

620
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:19,799
I haven't accused you of anything.

621
00:51:20,499 --> 00:51:22,616
All doctors are alike.

622
00:51:22,681 --> 00:51:24,999
How can you be so sure about that?

623
00:51:26,618 --> 00:51:27,788
I happen to know a great deal

624
00:51:27,855 --> 00:51:29,592
about the medical profession.

625
00:51:29,956 --> 00:51:32,294
That's interesting.

626
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:36,165
Did you study medicine yourself?

627
00:51:37,228 --> 00:51:39,299
You ask too many questions.

628
00:51:39,364 --> 00:51:41,036
That's only because I want to help you.

629
00:51:41,101 --> 00:51:43,104
Then get me out of here.

630
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:44,273
It wasn't my fault.

631
00:51:44,338 --> 00:51:46,540
You've got to understand that.

632
00:51:46,605 --> 00:51:49,278
I had nothing to do with it.

633
00:51:49,342 --> 00:51:52,485
It was, it was Lucy.

634
00:51:52,549 --> 00:51:54,284
Tell me about it.

635
00:51:59,452 --> 00:52:01,623
All right.

636
00:52:04,927 --> 00:52:06,728
All right.

637
00:52:21,242 --> 00:52:22,477
How do you feel Barbara?

638
00:52:22,543 --> 00:52:23,879
You look marvellous.

639
00:52:23,945 --> 00:52:25,947
Oh I feel fine.

640
00:52:26,013 --> 00:52:27,650
George if you only knew how wonderful it is

641
00:52:27,716 --> 00:52:29,518
to be coming home again.

642
00:52:29,583 --> 00:52:32,557
Listen, I hope you're going to be very, very happy.

643
00:52:32,622 --> 00:52:33,926
Of course I will.

644
00:52:33,991 --> 00:52:34,858
Don't worry.

645
00:52:34,924 --> 00:52:36,160
It's not going to be like the last time.

646
00:52:36,226 --> 00:52:38,396
That's all over with now.

647
00:52:38,461 --> 00:52:40,596
I'm sure of it.

648
00:52:40,661 --> 00:52:42,902
Good.

649
00:52:42,967 --> 00:52:44,804
We're nearly there now.

650
00:53:18,134 --> 00:53:19,203
What's the matter?

651
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:20,372
I don't know.

652
00:53:20,437 --> 00:53:21,971
I could swear I saw someone looking out of the window.

653
00:53:22,037 --> 00:53:23,175
Oh?

654
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:24,876
I thought for a moment it might be Lucy.

655
00:53:24,942 --> 00:53:26,746
Now remember what you promised in the hospital.

656
00:53:26,812 --> 00:53:28,482
You're not to mention her name again.

657
00:53:28,547 --> 00:53:29,582
Yes I know. I'm sorry.

658
00:53:29,648 --> 00:53:31,148
But there is someone inside isn't there?

659
00:53:31,214 --> 00:53:31,984
Yes.

660
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:32,885
Who is it?

661
00:53:32,951 --> 00:53:34,655
You'll soon see.

662
00:53:34,721 --> 00:53:35,789
Who is it?

663
00:53:35,855 --> 00:53:37,158
Ah! Nurse Higgins.

664
00:53:37,224 --> 00:53:38,826
This is my sister, Barbara.

665
00:53:38,891 --> 00:53:41,661
Hello. I've heard so much about you.

666
00:53:43,226 --> 00:53:44,663
Nurse? I don't need a nurse.

667
00:53:44,729 --> 00:53:45,864
Now it's only temporary

668
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:47,432
until you get settled in again.

669
00:53:47,497 --> 00:53:48,633
The doctor suggested it.

670
00:53:48,699 --> 00:53:49,768
Here. I'll take that sir.

671
00:53:49,834 --> 00:53:52,170
Shall we go upstairs now?

672
00:53:52,235 --> 00:53:53,671
Upstairs?

673
00:53:53,737 --> 00:53:55,274
You can pop right into bed.

674
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:56,944
Bed?

675
00:53:57,009 --> 00:53:58,479
In the middle of the afternoon?

676
00:53:58,544 --> 00:53:59,978
Well you've had quite a long trip.

677
00:54:00,044 --> 00:54:01,946
You must rest.

678
00:54:02,011 --> 00:54:03,816
But I'm not in the least bit tired.

679
00:54:03,881 --> 00:54:06,288
Now Barbara you promised me remember?

680
00:54:06,353 --> 00:54:10,793
You're to follow the doctor's instructions.

681
00:54:10,856 --> 00:54:12,192
This is my home.

682
00:54:12,258 --> 00:54:14,060
Our home -

683
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:17,736
and I hope that we'’ll be together here always.

684
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,904
You don't want to go back into hospital do you?

685
00:54:20,968 --> 00:54:23,572
No. You wouldn't.

686
00:54:23,637 --> 00:54:27,711
Well I sincerely hope it won't be necessary.

687
00:54:27,774 --> 00:54:29,746
Come along dear.

688
00:54:31,645 --> 00:54:34,684
Well aren't you going to come up?

689
00:54:34,748 --> 00:54:36,853
Later.

690
00:54:53,265 --> 00:54:54,300
I still think it's ridiculous

691
00:54:54,366 --> 00:54:55,737
going to bed at this hour.

692
00:54:55,802 --> 00:54:57,005
The doctor says you need a nap

693
00:54:57,070 --> 00:54:58,174
every day before tea

694
00:54:58,239 --> 00:54:59,275
to keep your strength up.

695
00:54:59,341 --> 00:55:00,409
But I'll never sleep.

696
00:55:00,475 --> 00:55:03,181
Here. You're to drink this.

697
00:55:03,245 --> 00:55:04,078
Well what is it?

698
00:55:04,144 --> 00:55:05,179
Only a sedative dear -

699
00:55:05,245 --> 00:55:06,346
to calm your nerves.

700
00:55:06,412 --> 00:55:10,222
I am calm - perfectly calm.

701
00:55:10,286 --> 00:55:11,657
If I could just have one of my pills.

702
00:55:11,722 --> 00:55:14,693
Now we're not to have any more of those things.

703
00:55:18,728 --> 00:55:22,534
That's better. Now in we go.

704
00:55:28,437 --> 00:55:30,274
All comfy?

705
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:41,119
Try to sleep now

706
00:55:41,185 --> 00:55:43,686
and I'll look in on you a little later on.

707
00:55:43,751 --> 00:55:45,355
Tonight after dinner

708
00:55:45,421 --> 00:55:47,690
we'll have a nice chat.

709
00:55:47,755 --> 00:55:49,727
You'll be staying here in the evenings too?

710
00:55:49,792 --> 00:55:51,095
Well of course I will.

711
00:55:51,161 --> 00:55:52,497
And your brother's given me the room

712
00:55:52,563 --> 00:55:54,267
right next to yours.

713
00:56:01,205 --> 00:56:04,613
(Phone ringing)

714
00:56:06,111 --> 00:56:07,378
Hello?

715
00:56:07,445 --> 00:56:09,349
Oh yes would you hold on a minute please?

716
00:56:09,414 --> 00:56:11,584
Nurse Higgins it's for you.

717
00:56:15,254 --> 00:56:16,723
Thank you.

718
00:56:16,788 --> 00:56:17,958
Hello, yes?

719
00:56:18,024 --> 00:56:20,559
Yes speaking.

720
00:56:20,624 --> 00:56:24,833
Oh no. Where did you say?

721
00:56:24,896 --> 00:56:27,066
Charring Cross Hospital.

722
00:56:27,131 --> 00:56:29,836
No danger?

723
00:56:29,901 --> 00:56:32,173
She's seventy-eight.

724
00:56:32,238 --> 00:56:33,104
I'll come at once

725
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:34,674
as soon as I can.

726
00:56:34,739 --> 00:56:36,507
Nurse Higgins is anything a matter?

727
00:56:36,572 --> 00:56:37,840
It's my mother.

728
00:56:37,907 --> 00:56:39,311
I'm afraid she's had an accident.

729
00:56:39,377 --> 00:56:41,580
I must go to her.

730
00:56:41,644 --> 00:56:43,349
Well what about my sister?

731
00:56:43,415 --> 00:56:44,951
I put her to bed under sedation.

732
00:56:45,017 --> 00:56:46,755
She'll sleep for hours.

733
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,822
Well now look there's a train in twenty minutes.

734
00:56:48,888 --> 00:56:50,189
I'll run you to the station.

735
00:56:50,254 --> 00:56:51,825
Oh thank you! I -

736
00:56:51,891 --> 00:56:53,729
I'll get my bag.

737
00:58:29,125 --> 00:58:31,465
Hello love.

738
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:34,001
Lucy!

739
00:58:34,065 --> 00:58:35,766
How did you get in here?

740
00:58:35,832 --> 00:58:37,769
It wasn't easy.

741
00:58:37,834 --> 00:58:40,039
I've been waiting ever since you came home.

742
00:58:40,104 --> 00:58:41,140
Where?

743
00:58:41,205 --> 00:58:42,274
In the garage.

744
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:44,108
That's where I phoned in from.

745
00:58:44,173 --> 00:58:45,343
Phoned?

746
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:47,578
I had to get them out of the house.

747
00:58:47,644 --> 00:58:49,247
I knew he'd be gentlemen enough

748
00:58:49,311 --> 00:58:51,417
to drive her to the station.

749
00:58:53,982 --> 00:58:56,586
Well aren't you glad to see me?

750
00:58:56,651 --> 00:58:58,187
Well of course I am.

751
00:58:58,253 --> 00:58:59,891
What if he finds you here?

752
00:58:59,957 --> 00:59:03,497
I know. That's why we have to work quickly.

753
00:59:04,494 --> 00:59:05,662
I don't understand.

754
00:59:05,728 --> 00:59:07,767
Obviously.

755
00:59:07,831 --> 00:59:09,334
What's the matter?

756
00:59:09,399 --> 00:59:12,106
Nothing. I just feel a little faint.

757
00:59:12,171 --> 00:59:14,375
Have you been taking those pills again?

758
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:18,077
No. No that's all over with.

759
00:59:18,141 --> 00:59:19,576
He doesn't trust you does he?

760
00:59:19,642 --> 00:59:21,950
Shutting you up like this in a darkened room,

761
00:59:22,014 --> 00:59:25,420
bringing in a nurse.

762
00:59:25,484 --> 00:59:27,788
She's not your nurse you know.

763
00:59:27,852 --> 00:59:29,690
She's your guard

764
00:59:29,754 --> 00:59:31,925
- your keeper.

765
00:59:31,990 --> 00:59:34,529
But George wouldn't do a thing like that.

766
00:59:34,594 --> 00:59:38,368
Oh wouldn't he?

767
00:59:38,431 --> 00:59:41,171
Who owns this house?

768
00:59:41,235 --> 00:59:42,636
Why I do.

769
00:59:42,702 --> 00:59:43,702
When father died

770
00:59:43,768 --> 00:59:45,608
he let everything to me.

771
00:59:45,673 --> 00:59:49,078
And if something happened to you?

772
00:59:49,141 --> 00:59:51,447
Suppose George has you put away for good?

773
00:59:51,513 --> 00:59:53,617
Oh he wouldn't.

774
00:59:55,617 --> 00:59:57,650
Oh he couldn't.

775
00:59:57,716 --> 01:00:00,353
All he has to do is to tell the doctors

776
01:00:00,418 --> 01:00:02,524
that you are too difficult to control at home.

777
01:00:02,589 --> 01:00:03,991
That nurse will back him up.

778
01:00:04,056 --> 01:00:06,027
But you know that's not true.

779
01:00:06,093 --> 01:00:08,163
And what good does that do?

780
01:00:08,228 --> 01:00:10,664
George won't listen to me.

781
01:00:10,729 --> 01:00:12,499
He doesn't even like you to see me.

782
01:00:12,565 --> 01:00:16,510
That's so isn't it? Isn't it?

783
01:00:25,046 --> 01:00:27,017
What am I going to do?

784
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:28,918
I've got to get you away from here

785
01:00:28,983 --> 01:00:31,387
and we haven't got much time.

786
01:00:31,452 --> 01:00:33,121
But if I stay with you

787
01:00:33,186 --> 01:00:34,489
he'll find me.

788
01:00:34,555 --> 01:00:36,425
Where could we go?

789
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:37,824
I thought of that.

790
01:00:37,891 --> 01:00:40,429
We could take a room somewhere.

791
01:00:40,494 --> 01:00:41,863
Do you have any money?

792
01:00:41,928 --> 01:00:44,035
No but you do.

793
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:45,402
A hundred pounds

794
01:00:45,468 --> 01:00:49,506
you put away for a new dress.

795
01:00:49,569 --> 01:00:50,838
How did you know that?

796
01:00:50,904 --> 01:00:52,072
You told me.

797
01:00:52,139 --> 01:00:54,912
Don't you remember?

798
01:00:56,345 --> 01:00:57,414
I'll get it.

799
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:00,652
No hurry. We can't go now.

800
01:01:00,716 --> 01:01:02,617
Not in broad daylight.

801
01:01:02,683 --> 01:01:04,487
Somebody's bound to notice.

802
01:01:04,553 --> 01:01:07,061
Besides we'll need a car.

803
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:09,995
Tonight when George is asleep.

804
01:01:17,534 --> 01:01:18,769
Now don't you worry.

805
01:01:18,835 --> 01:01:21,508
Just leave everything to me.

806
01:02:44,025 --> 01:02:46,194
Barbara?

807
01:03:03,811 --> 01:03:07,652
(Phone ringing)

808
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:15,024
Hello?

809
01:03:15,089 --> 01:03:18,462
Yes Nurse Higgins.

810
01:03:18,525 --> 01:03:20,294
She wasn't?

811
01:03:20,359 --> 01:03:22,865
That's very strange.

812
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:25,603
But you will be back tonight?

813
01:03:25,667 --> 01:03:26,434
Good.

814
01:03:26,501 --> 01:03:28,737
Now there's a late train getting in at ten o'clock.

815
01:03:28,802 --> 01:03:29,970
Take a taxi from the station

816
01:03:30,036 --> 01:03:31,739
and I'll reimburse you.

817
01:03:31,805 --> 01:03:34,346
Splendid. Well I'll expect you then.

818
01:03:34,411 --> 01:03:35,846
Goodbye.

819
01:04:12,314 --> 01:04:14,886
Come on love. Wake up.

820
01:04:14,952 --> 01:04:16,087
Hurry up. Get dressed.

821
01:04:16,152 --> 01:04:19,026
It'’s time to go!

822
01:04:19,090 --> 01:04:21,224
Not so loud. He'll hear you.

823
01:04:21,289 --> 01:04:22,591
George?

824
01:04:22,656 --> 01:04:24,729
I've got some of the sedative they had for you.

825
01:04:24,794 --> 01:04:26,933
Put it in his tea.

826
01:04:26,999 --> 01:04:29,237
Oh. Will he sleep?

827
01:04:29,302 --> 01:04:30,903
He didn't even feel it

828
01:04:30,969 --> 01:04:32,871
when I took his car keys.

829
01:04:34,938 --> 01:04:36,141
Miss Higgins?

830
01:04:36,207 --> 01:04:38,044
Oh by the time she gets here we'll be gone.

831
01:04:38,109 --> 01:04:41,316
Come on now. There.

832
01:04:41,381 --> 01:04:43,216
You go and get dressed.

833
01:04:43,281 --> 01:04:44,985
Are you okay love?

834
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:48,657
Yes, yes. Just a touch of nerves.

835
01:04:48,721 --> 01:04:50,591
I guess I'm not used to so much excitement.

836
01:04:50,656 --> 01:04:53,292
Oh I love excitement!

837
01:04:57,897 --> 01:04:59,666
Here we are.

838
01:04:59,732 --> 01:05:02,400
Just the thing.

839
01:05:02,464 --> 01:05:04,133
What do you want with those?

840
01:05:04,198 --> 01:05:06,338
To cut the phone cord, silly.

841
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:07,907
We don't want old Miss Higgins

842
01:05:07,972 --> 01:05:10,978
giving the alarm now do we?

843
01:05:11,043 --> 01:05:12,814
You do think of everything.

844
01:05:12,879 --> 01:05:15,081
Oh I try to.

845
01:05:15,146 --> 01:05:16,648
Now you hurry and get dressed

846
01:05:16,713 --> 01:05:19,457
and I'll go down the hall and, uh...

847
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:25,729
Remember - I expect to find you dressed when I get back.

848
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:31,633
I say...

849
01:05:31,698 --> 01:05:33,935
What?

850
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,604
It is a lark isn't it?

851
01:05:36,669 --> 01:05:38,673
Just like old times.

852
01:06:46,341 --> 01:06:48,278
What are you doing?

853
01:06:48,343 --> 01:06:49,877
Give them to me.

854
01:06:49,943 --> 01:06:50,979
I can't.

855
01:06:51,045 --> 01:06:52,617
I need them.

856
01:06:52,683 --> 01:06:54,184
Give them to me.

857
01:06:54,251 --> 01:06:56,255
Please Lucy - one more.

858
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:59,626
I am not going to watch you ruin yourself.

859
01:06:59,689 --> 01:07:01,795
One more Lucy. Then I promise.

860
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:04,397
I thought you said you weren't taking them.

861
01:07:04,462 --> 01:07:06,733
I can't help it.

862
01:07:06,798 --> 01:07:09,736
You mean you don't want to help it.

863
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,202
You always had a choice.

864
01:07:11,268 --> 01:07:12,670
George or the pills.

865
01:07:12,735 --> 01:07:13,670
Me or the pills.

866
01:07:13,735 --> 01:07:15,539
And the pills always win

867
01:07:15,604 --> 01:07:17,811
because deep down inside

868
01:07:17,876 --> 01:07:19,510
you hate George.

869
01:07:19,576 --> 01:07:21,278
You hate me!

870
01:07:21,343 --> 01:07:26,055
No. No Lucy you're my best friend!

871
01:07:26,118 --> 01:07:29,188
These are your friends -

872
01:07:29,252 --> 01:07:31,425
your only friends.

873
01:07:31,490 --> 01:07:34,228
Oh I'm good enough for you when you're in trouble.

874
01:07:34,292 --> 01:07:36,162
But I've never been good enough for George

875
01:07:36,227 --> 01:07:38,766
or anyone else you know.

876
01:07:38,831 --> 01:07:40,766
And now I, I can't even win out

877
01:07:40,831 --> 01:07:42,433
with your hand full of these.

878
01:07:42,499 --> 01:07:44,637
No!

879
01:07:47,474 --> 01:07:49,977
What I have done for you today

880
01:07:50,041 --> 01:07:52,179
you'll never know -

881
01:07:52,244 --> 01:07:55,049
and it isn't enough.

882
01:07:55,114 --> 01:07:57,352
I'm getting out. Now!

883
01:07:57,417 --> 01:07:59,354
No Lucy!

884
01:08:03,557 --> 01:08:05,726
Do you want these?

885
01:08:05,792 --> 01:08:08,732
Here - take them.

886
01:08:12,898 --> 01:08:14,601
Lucy!

887
01:08:18,806 --> 01:08:20,175
Lucy?

888
01:08:21,874 --> 01:08:23,108
Lucy?

889
01:08:28,781 --> 01:08:30,617
Lucy?

890
01:08:34,586 --> 01:08:36,993
(Car driving away)

891
01:08:37,058 --> 01:08:38,795
Lucy come back!

892
01:08:41,230 --> 01:08:43,133
Miss Barbara! What are you doing out of bed?

893
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:43,899
I've got to go out.

894
01:08:43,966 --> 01:08:44,766
At this time of night?

895
01:08:44,834 --> 01:08:46,635
Yes. You don't understand. It's Lucy.

896
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:47,702
Lucy?

897
01:08:47,769 --> 01:08:50,040
Yes. She just left. I heard the car pull away.

898
01:08:50,105 --> 01:08:52,008
That was the cab I came in.

899
01:08:52,074 --> 01:08:54,178
There's no one out here.

900
01:08:54,243 --> 01:08:56,311
No-one.

901
01:08:56,376 --> 01:08:58,013
Oh.

902
01:08:58,079 --> 01:09:00,315
Well then she's still here.

903
01:09:05,085 --> 01:09:06,688
Where's your brother?

904
01:09:06,754 --> 01:09:08,493
In the study I suppose.

905
01:09:10,993 --> 01:09:12,128
George?

906
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,163
George?

907
01:09:17,565 --> 01:09:19,803
(Screaming)

908
01:09:48,732 --> 01:09:50,303
Barbara?

909
01:09:52,003 --> 01:09:53,437
Barbara?

910
01:10:19,930 --> 01:10:22,638
There Barbara.

911
01:10:22,702 --> 01:10:24,874
Now you're free -

912
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:27,742
free of all of them.

913
01:10:36,582 --> 01:10:37,816
Now do you understand

914
01:10:37,882 --> 01:10:40,185
why I must see a lawyer?

915
01:10:40,249 --> 01:10:42,923
They said I killed them.

916
01:10:42,987 --> 01:10:46,694
They say my fingerprints are on the shears.

917
01:10:46,758 --> 01:10:47,960
It was Lucy,

918
01:10:48,025 --> 01:10:50,430
Lucy who did it.

919
01:10:50,495 --> 01:10:54,538
What does Lucy have to say about that?

920
01:10:54,602 --> 01:10:58,740
Why don't you ask her yourself?

921
01:10:58,803 --> 01:11:00,999 
She's here with us now.

922
01:11:01,673 --> 01:11:08,054
Where?

923
01:11:08,114 --> 01:11:09,785
There she is.

924
01:11:09,850 --> 01:11:12,220
Don't you see her?

925
01:11:13,518 --> 01:11:15,292
Don't you see her?

926
01:11:16,993 --> 01:11:19,029
Don't you see here?

927
01:11:20,861 --> 01:11:26,539
(Laughing)

928
01:11:29,438 --> 01:11:32,141
Was there a George and a Miss Higgins murdered?

929
01:11:32,206 --> 01:11:34,845
There may have been.

930
01:11:34,909 --> 01:11:36,847
No Lucy?

931
01:11:36,912 --> 01:11:41,619
There may not have even been a Barbara.

932
01:11:41,682 --> 01:11:44,754
You mean she might be Dr. Starr?

933
01:11:44,818 --> 01:11:46,891
No I don't think so.

934
01:11:46,956 --> 01:11:50,928
I don't think I've met Dr. Starr yet.

935
01:11:50,992 --> 01:11:53,829
Maybe there is no such person.

936
01:11:53,893 --> 01:11:54,928
Perhaps your Dr. Rutherford

937
01:11:54,994 --> 01:11:56,466
is just playing a game.

938
01:11:56,532 --> 01:12:00,108
Doctor Rutherford never plays games.

939
01:12:00,171 --> 01:12:02,038
How many more are there for me to see?

940
01:12:02,103 --> 01:12:03,338
Just one.

941
01:12:03,404 --> 01:12:04,473
And then the choice?

942
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:06,510
Then the choice.

943
01:12:06,575 --> 01:12:09,249
Tell me about this one.

944
01:12:09,313 --> 01:12:12,018
He calls himself 'Byron'.

945
01:12:12,083 --> 01:12:13,951
'Dr. Byron'.

946
01:12:18,886 --> 01:12:20,791
Byron?

947
01:12:23,892 --> 01:12:25,295
Gentlemen?

948
01:12:27,027 --> 01:12:30,303
I brought Dr. Martin to see you.

949
01:12:30,367 --> 01:12:33,372
It's always a pleasure to meet a colleague.

950
01:12:33,436 --> 01:12:36,408
You're a doctor?

951
01:12:36,473 --> 01:12:38,444
Indeed I am sir

952
01:12:38,509 --> 01:12:43,150
- physician, neurosurgeon and orthopaedic specialist.

953
01:12:43,213 --> 01:12:47,051
And lately I found

954
01:12:47,115 --> 01:12:49,788
still another vocation

955
01:12:49,852 --> 01:12:52,491
even more fascinating.

956
01:12:52,556 --> 01:12:54,694
Do you care to see some of my recent work?

957
01:12:54,759 --> 01:12:56,361
Yes I'd be happy to.

958
01:12:56,427 --> 01:12:59,132
If you'd be good enough to step over here.

959
01:13:05,437 --> 01:13:09,846
Mmm. Who are the subjects?

960
01:13:09,908 --> 01:13:11,512
Former colleagues of mine.

961
01:13:11,577 --> 01:13:14,550
Of course I had to model their faces from memory.

962
01:13:14,615 --> 01:13:15,649
Quite a hobby.

963
01:13:15,714 --> 01:13:17,650
Oh it's more than a hobby.

964
01:13:17,714 --> 01:13:19,552
Much more.

965
01:13:19,617 --> 01:13:22,727
These are not ordinary figures.

966
01:13:22,790 --> 01:13:26,192
The eyes were made to see.

967
01:13:26,256 --> 01:13:29,029
Inside each skull is a perfectly proportioned brain

968
01:13:29,093 --> 01:13:31,664
perfectly capable of functioning.

969
01:13:31,728 --> 01:13:33,499
You talk about them as though they were alive.

970
01:13:33,564 --> 01:13:38,206
Mmm. That's the final step.

971
01:13:38,269 --> 01:13:41,844
From playthings to creations

972
01:13:41,907 --> 01:13:43,912
- living creations.

973
01:13:43,978 --> 01:13:47,050
I know it sounds a bit, uh, (laughs).

974
01:13:47,114 --> 01:13:48,549
But you see the Bible tells us

975
01:13:48,615 --> 01:13:51,186
that the Lord God formed a man

976
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:53,155
from the dust of the ground.

977
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:54,689
And he breathed into his nostrils

978
01:13:54,754 --> 01:13:55,691
the breath of life.

979
01:13:55,756 --> 01:13:57,660
Thus the man became a living creature.

980
01:13:57,725 --> 01:13:59,928
Do you believe that doctor?

981
01:13:59,993 --> 01:14:01,533
I'm afraid I put my belief in science.

982
01:14:01,693 --> 01:14:03,464
And so do I.

983
01:14:03,529 --> 01:14:06,034
If I could breathe my, uh,

984
01:14:06,099 --> 01:14:09,205
consciousness into one of these figures

985
01:14:09,268 --> 01:14:13,144
that figure will come alive.

986
01:14:13,207 --> 01:14:15,679
Do you want to see what I'm working on now?

987
01:14:20,579 --> 01:14:24,689
Call it my, my final creation.

988
01:14:24,752 --> 01:14:25,954
That's your face.

989
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:28,057
Mm-hmm. My face and - inside - my body

990
01:14:28,122 --> 01:14:31,693
correct to the smallest detail.

991
01:14:31,757 --> 01:14:33,360
I can turn it on and you'll say, 'Oh yes,

992
01:14:33,426 --> 01:14:35,566
it operates on batteries'.

993
01:14:35,631 --> 01:14:40,307
But how do you know what it is inside?

994
01:14:40,369 --> 01:14:41,839
What is it?

995
01:14:41,905 --> 01:14:46,948
It's me - I mean not yet but

996
01:14:47,009 --> 01:14:48,446
it will be.

997
01:14:48,511 --> 01:14:52,183
Through the power of concentration I shall,

998
01:14:52,246 --> 01:14:54,786
I shall will my mind to enter its body

999
01:14:54,851 --> 01:14:56,989
and it'll be me.

1000
01:14:57,054 --> 01:14:58,688
Rutherford wouldn't believe I could do it.

1001
01:14:58,754 --> 01:14:59,856
He locked me up.

1002
01:14:59,922 --> 01:15:03,228
But he let me keep my, my dolls.

1003
01:15:03,291 --> 01:15:06,066
'Occupational therapy' he called it.

1004
01:15:06,131 --> 01:15:08,501
He'll soon find out what they are.

1005
01:15:11,966 --> 01:15:15,206
That's right - go.

1006
01:15:15,271 --> 01:15:16,574
Run away and hide from the truth

1007
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:18,543
like that idiot downstairs.

1008
01:15:18,608 --> 01:15:19,644
But it won't do any good you know.

1009
01:15:19,710 --> 01:15:21,412
You can tell Rutherford for me.

1010
01:15:21,478 --> 01:15:24,850
Tell him the truth will find him out!

1011
01:15:24,913 --> 01:15:26,618
Tell him!

1012
01:15:33,891 --> 01:15:37,198
Well? Which is it?

1013
01:15:37,262 --> 01:15:38,429
Would you mind stepping into your office

1014
01:15:38,495 --> 01:15:41,468
and telling the doctor that I'm ready to come down?

1015
01:15:41,532 --> 01:15:43,133
No need.

1016
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:45,035
I'll use the intercom.

1017
01:15:47,973 --> 01:15:49,042
What do you want me to tell him?

1018
01:15:49,107 --> 01:15:52,546
Just tell him I'm coming to see him.

1019
01:15:52,610 --> 01:15:55,180
Doctor Martin is ready to come down sir.

1020
01:15:56,447 --> 01:15:57,951
(Door Buzzing)

1021
01:15:58,017 --> 01:15:58,952
There you are.

1022
01:15:59,018 --> 01:15:59,919
Thank you for your help.

1023
01:15:59,986 --> 01:16:02,823
Don't mention it. It was a pleasure.

1024
01:16:02,886 --> 01:16:05,858
And doctor

1025
01:16:05,922 --> 01:16:07,258
- good luck.

1026
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:23,050
So you've seen the patients.

1027
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:25,348
Well? What do you think?

1028
01:16:25,412 --> 01:16:28,316
I think it's a disgrace -

1029
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:30,319
this institution,

1030
01:16:30,384 --> 01:16:32,119
the way it's run,

1031
01:16:32,185 --> 01:16:33,689
everything about it.

1032
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:34,890
Those patients,

1033
01:16:34,956 --> 01:16:37,224
locked away by themselves,

1034
01:16:37,290 --> 01:16:38,625
lost in their own fantasies

1035
01:16:38,691 --> 01:16:39,827
and no attempt made

1036
01:16:39,892 --> 01:16:41,161
to bring them back to reality.

1037
01:16:41,228 --> 01:16:45,269
You forget - they're incurable.

1038
01:16:45,332 --> 01:16:47,870
Take a man like Byron.

1039
01:16:47,934 --> 01:16:50,941
You think you could rid him of his delusions?

1040
01:16:51,005 --> 01:16:52,273
I'd be willing to try.

1041
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:54,409
Then you'd fail.

1042
01:16:54,474 --> 01:16:57,878
Byron is hopelessly insane.

1043
01:17:46,594 --> 01:17:48,633
There's only way to remove

1044
01:17:48,697 --> 01:17:51,600
Byron's hallucinations -

1045
01:17:54,937 --> 01:17:55,972
with this.

1046
01:17:56,039 --> 01:17:57,242
Pre-frontal lobotomy?

1047
01:17:57,308 --> 01:17:58,744
Exactly.

1048
01:17:58,810 --> 01:18:00,111
Do you believe that surgery

1049
01:18:00,175 --> 01:18:03,050
is a substitute for psychiatry?

1050
01:18:03,115 --> 01:18:05,352
It's effective.

1051
01:18:05,417 --> 01:18:06,586
Yes it's effective -

1052
01:18:06,652 --> 01:18:09,825
in turning intelligent human beings into vegetables.

1053
01:20:37,139 --> 01:20:39,310
(Service lift buzzer)

1054
01:20:59,128 --> 01:21:03,239
And now your choice.

1055
01:21:03,302 --> 01:21:05,639
You'd still give me the job in spite of our differences?

1056
01:21:05,703 --> 01:21:09,574
If you choose correctly.

1057
01:21:09,637 --> 01:21:12,677
You might do some good here.

1058
01:21:12,742 --> 01:21:14,277
So?

1059
01:21:14,343 --> 01:21:16,315
Your choice?

1060
01:21:24,124 --> 01:21:25,060
Your tea doctor.

1061
01:21:25,126 --> 01:21:26,394
Thank you nurse.

1062
01:21:31,630 --> 01:21:33,768
Milk and sugar?

1063
01:21:33,833 --> 01:21:35,736
Nothing.

1064
01:21:35,801 --> 01:21:39,675
I'm going back to London.

1065
01:21:39,738 --> 01:21:41,875
You won't choose?

1066
01:21:41,939 --> 01:21:44,346
No.

1067
01:21:44,410 --> 01:21:47,582
I'm disappointed in you Martin.

1068
01:21:47,647 --> 01:21:50,018
Why? Because I refuse to play games with you?

1069
01:21:50,082 --> 01:21:52,186
Because you admit defeat.

1070
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:53,187
Defeat?

1071
01:21:53,251 --> 01:21:55,122
You can't identify Dr. Starr.

1072
01:21:55,187 --> 01:21:57,293
That's why you're leaving isn't it?

1073
01:21:57,358 --> 01:21:59,058
Because you failed the test.

1074
01:21:59,123 --> 01:22:00,861
Test!

1075
01:22:00,927 --> 01:22:01,893
I'm not a schoolboy.

1076
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:03,361
I'm a qualified doctor.

1077
01:22:03,426 --> 01:22:06,100
Obviously not qualified to practice here.

1078
01:22:06,165 --> 01:22:08,870
These patients are badly in need of proper therapy.

1079
01:22:08,934 --> 01:22:09,736
You won't help them.

1080
01:22:09,803 --> 01:22:11,340
You won't even let them help themselves.

1081
01:22:11,406 --> 01:22:12,939
On the contrary

1082
01:22:13,005 --> 01:22:14,443
I give them every opportunity

1083
01:22:14,509 --> 01:22:16,044
to work out their fantasies.

1084
01:22:16,110 --> 01:22:17,246
Perhaps wrongly.

1085
01:22:17,312 --> 01:22:18,781
Take Byron for example.

1086
01:22:18,846 --> 01:22:20,649
His work is remarkable.

1087
01:22:20,715 --> 01:22:23,085
Also dangerous.

1088
01:22:23,149 --> 01:22:24,117
Dangerous?

1089
01:22:24,184 --> 01:22:25,386
To himself.

1090
01:22:25,451 --> 01:22:28,155
Perhaps it's time I put an end to it,

1091
01:22:28,221 --> 01:22:29,624
destroyed his figures.

1092
01:22:29,690 --> 01:22:30,894
That may make him even worse.

1093
01:22:30,959 --> 01:22:32,760
Or cure him.

1094
01:22:36,094 --> 01:22:37,733
Yes I think the time has come

1095
01:22:37,798 --> 01:22:40,170
to take Byron's toys away from him.

1096
01:22:40,234 --> 01:22:41,536
(Scream)

1097
01:22:41,602 --> 01:22:43,671
Help!

1098
01:22:46,072 --> 01:22:47,108
Help!

1099
01:23:22,445 --> 01:23:24,884
(Scream)

1100
01:23:52,877 --> 01:23:54,181
Byron?

1101
01:23:56,548 --> 01:23:59,086
I was in my office

1102
01:23:59,151 --> 01:24:00,819
when he cried out.

1103
01:24:00,884 --> 01:24:04,926
By the time I got to his room it was too late.

1104
01:24:04,989 --> 01:24:06,026
He's dead?

1105
01:24:06,091 --> 01:24:11,734
All of his body was crushed.

1106
01:24:11,796 --> 01:24:14,269
So that's the end of Byron Starr.

1107
01:24:14,333 --> 01:24:17,505
You recognized him then sir?

1108
01:24:17,569 --> 01:24:18,870
It was obvious.

1109
01:24:18,936 --> 01:24:19,936
Where are you going?

1110
01:24:20,003 --> 01:24:21,673
To call the police.

1111
01:24:21,739 --> 01:24:23,343
Is there a phone in your office?

1112
01:24:23,408 --> 01:24:24,811
Don't go in there sir.

1113
01:24:35,420 --> 01:24:36,857
No!

1114
01:24:47,602 --> 01:24:50,839
He's been strangled.

1115
01:24:50,903 --> 01:24:53,276
Two days ago.

1116
01:24:53,341 --> 01:24:55,211
There was no opportunity to dispose of it.

1117
01:24:55,276 --> 01:24:57,681
Dispose of it? Who is he?

1118
01:24:57,746 --> 01:25:00,382
His name was Max Reynolds.

1119
01:25:00,446 --> 01:25:02,616
The Orderly?

1120
01:25:07,454 --> 01:25:08,824
Yes.

1121
01:25:08,889 --> 01:25:11,893
I'm afraid your guess was wrong.

1122
01:25:11,957 --> 01:25:13,829
I am Dr. Starr.

1123
01:25:52,466 --> 01:26:24,749
(insane laughter builds)

1124
01:27:10,382 --> 01:27:11,550
Ah good afternoon.

1125
01:27:11,589 --> 01:27:12,485
Good afternoon.

1126
01:27:12,551 --> 01:27:13,799
I've come about the appointment.

1127
01:27:14,199 --> 01:27:15,799
Yes. I was expecting you.

1128
01:27:16,722 --> 01:27:17,723
Do come in.

1129
01:27:17,890 --> 01:27:19,193
Thank you.

1130
01:27:22,199 --> 01:27:23,697
Better keep the door closed

1131
01:27:23,763 --> 01:27:24,932
and keep out the drafts as

1132
01:27:25,699 --> 01:27:27,836
[sinister irony] Dr. Starr used to say.
