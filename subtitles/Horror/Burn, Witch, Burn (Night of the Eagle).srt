1
00:00:00,666 --> 00:00:04,080
<i>My name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until...</i>

2
00:00:04,712 --> 00:00:07,132
We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.

3
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:09,593
<i>When you're burned,
you've got nothing...</i>

4
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,220
<i>no cash, no credit, no job history.</i>

5
00:00:12,386 --> 00:00:14,598
<i>You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.</i>

6
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,224
- Where am I?
- Miami.

7
00:00:16,849 --> 00:00:19,048
<i>You do whatever work comes your way.</i>

8
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:22,564
<i>You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.</i>

9
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,525
- <i>A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...</i>
- Should we shoot them?

10
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:28,403
<i>An old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

11
00:00:28,569 --> 00:00:30,781
You know spies...
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

12
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:33,200
- <i>Family, too...</i>
- Hey, is that your mom again?

13
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,410
- <i>If you're desperate.</i>
- Someone needs your help.

14
00:00:35,576 --> 00:00:38,038
<i>Bottom line:
as long as you're burned,</i>

15
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,915
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

16
00:00:45,702 --> 00:00:46,581
<i>For spies,</i>

17
00:00:46,706 --> 00:00:49,299
<i>top-secret clearance
is just the beginning.</i>

18
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,372
<i>SCI, the right to view</i>

19
00:00:51,497 --> 00:00:54,107
<i>sensitive compartmentalized
information...</i>

20
00:00:54,232 --> 00:00:57,975
<i>is reserved for the most trusted people
in the intelligence community.</i>

21
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,982
That kind of access
comes with fewer constraints,

22
00:01:01,107 --> 00:01:05,357
<i>limited oversight, and
a frightening ability to do real harm.</i>

23
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,519
I'm getting a little jealous
of that badge.

24
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,328
I remember when you couldn't
keep your hands off me.

25
00:01:18,915 --> 00:01:20,789
I've waited years to see my name
on this again.

26
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,499
Now that it finally is...

27
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:25,607
A psychopath blackmails you
into using it

28
00:01:25,732 --> 00:01:28,547
to destroy files
in the CIA's computer system.

29
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,685
And when I do this,

30
00:01:31,705 --> 00:01:34,636
Anson Fullerton
goes back to being a ghost.

31
00:01:34,802 --> 00:01:36,680
I don't want you doing anything
for that man.

32
00:01:37,107 --> 00:01:38,563
If I don't do this, Fi,

33
00:01:38,688 --> 00:01:41,268
you'll spend the rest of your life
in jail for something you didn't do.

34
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:44,176
You think he's just gonna hand
over the evidence he has on me?

35
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,824
He'll keep forcing you to do his bidding.
There is no end to this.

36
00:01:47,949 --> 00:01:51,046
That is a possibility, but right now,
I don't have much choice.

37
00:01:52,106 --> 00:01:53,905
I'm not willing
to throw in the towel yet.

38
00:01:54,071 --> 00:01:56,867
Can you call Anson,
tell him you need to meet?

39
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,209
For what?

40
00:01:58,334 --> 00:01:59,576
Make up a reason.

41
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:03,097
But if you can get him
away from his car,

42
00:02:03,222 --> 00:02:05,172
Sam and I can plant this tracker.

43
00:02:05,297 --> 00:02:07,252
We can follow the rat
back to his nest.

44
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:10,046
Anson's not gonna hide blackmail
material under his pillow.

45
00:02:10,212 --> 00:02:11,548
Maybe we get lucky.

46
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:14,718
- It's too risky for a "maybe."
- It's even riskier to do nothing.

47
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,678
We can't win if we don't play.

48
00:02:20,642 --> 00:02:22,267
18 bucks for a mojito?

49
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,394
What kind of a tourist trap is this?

50
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,022
A tourist trap with a good view
of Michael's meeting place.

51
00:02:27,573 --> 00:02:29,399
You're wishing
that was a sniper rifle?

52
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:34,279
Can you think of anyone who deserves a
bullet more than that soulless bastard?

53
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:36,615
For now, let's just stick
to finding out where he lives.

54
00:02:38,476 --> 00:02:40,627
Okay, here he comes.
Break a leg, Fi.

55
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:45,165
You look tired.

56
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,375
Laboring on my behalf, I presume?

57
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:52,228
We better walk and talk.
Can I buy you a lemonade?

58
00:02:58,797 --> 00:03:00,263
You haven't answered my question.

59
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,054
There's a little delay.

60
00:03:02,179 --> 00:03:03,180
A delay?

61
00:03:04,197 --> 00:03:06,874
You have official access and the tools
to erase my name from that file.

62
00:03:06,999 --> 00:03:09,377
- Why isn't it done?
- Clearance is being held up.

63
00:03:09,502 --> 00:03:11,108
- It shouldn't be long, but...
- No.

64
00:03:11,273 --> 00:03:12,317
What?

65
00:03:12,773 --> 00:03:15,082
There's a great sentence
in your psych eval.

66
00:03:15,207 --> 00:03:18,968
It says, "Westen is particularly
skilled at social engineering,

67
00:03:19,093 --> 00:03:22,744
"creating rapport with targets
and steering them towards an objective."

68
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,663
I know your moves better than you do.

69
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,999
I don't know what you're planning,
but I'm not going to fall for it.

70
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:35,674
I can't see them.
Am I clear?

71
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,427
We're good. Mike walked
Anson out to the dunes, so...

72
00:03:39,593 --> 00:03:40,815
Yeah, go for it.

73
00:03:42,601 --> 00:03:43,515
Friday.

74
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,797
Have my name erased
from those files by Friday,

75
00:03:45,922 --> 00:03:48,299
or Fiona gets used
to taking group showers.

76
00:03:53,357 --> 00:03:55,316
Hang on, Fi. He's turned around.
Get out of there.

77
00:03:55,441 --> 00:03:56,945
<i>No. There's still a way to do this.</i>

78
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:05,412
He's headed to the bridge.
He's gonna have to cross the light.

79
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:06,663
<i>I'll catch him there.</i>

80
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,225
<i>Stoplights
are one of the worst places</i>

81
00:04:27,391 --> 00:04:30,358
<i>to approach a target trained
in counter-surveillance.</i>

82
00:04:30,483 --> 00:04:32,522
<i>Without having to worry
about driving,</i>

83
00:04:32,688 --> 00:04:34,941
<i>their full attention
is on their surroundings.</i>

84
00:04:35,107 --> 00:04:36,896
<i>They can use their mirrors
to pick up tails</i>

85
00:04:37,021 --> 00:04:39,167
<i>and check the area
for surveillance teams.</i>

86
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:42,657
<i>But if you need to plant a tracker
on someone who's on the move,</i>

87
00:04:42,823 --> 00:04:44,826
<i>you have to go the extra mile.</i>

88
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,017
Don't try that.

89
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,898
Westen Team
u-sub.net

90
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,858
sous-titres.eu

91
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,684
Anson's not stuck in traffic.
He's making another stop.

92
00:05:19,809 --> 00:05:22,489
All right. Good.
Show us where you live, doc. Come on.

93
00:05:26,473 --> 00:05:27,284
No.

94
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,121
Looks like
he's just going to the dentist.

95
00:05:30,287 --> 00:05:32,290
Sam and Fi are on his ass.
He's bound to go home.

96
00:05:32,456 --> 00:05:33,583
Just relax.

97
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,045
Hey, Maddy.

98
00:05:36,752 --> 00:05:38,873
Hey, ma.
What are you doing here?

99
00:05:47,254 --> 00:05:49,113
I couldn't do this on the phone.

100
00:05:49,238 --> 00:05:50,433
Do what?
What is it?

101
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:52,668
It's Andre.

102
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:54,771
He was shot.

103
00:05:56,662 --> 00:05:58,984
- He's dead, Michael.
- What?

104
00:06:01,585 --> 00:06:02,445
When?

105
00:06:03,037 --> 00:06:04,155
Last night.

106
00:06:04,321 --> 00:06:05,407
Who's Andre?

107
00:06:05,992 --> 00:06:07,753
He was my best friend
since childhood.

108
00:06:12,721 --> 00:06:14,873
- How's Ricky?
- His brother's dead.

109
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:17,928
He sounded like he was in shock.

110
00:06:18,813 --> 00:06:20,797
He wanted to know
if you would come by.

111
00:06:34,653 --> 00:06:37,105
You boys looked so sweet back then.

112
00:06:37,706 --> 00:06:40,025
It's easy to forget what little
hell-raisers you could be.

113
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,383
You know, growing up,

114
00:06:42,675 --> 00:06:44,988
Andre always thought
of you two as family.

115
00:06:45,392 --> 00:06:46,824
I am so sorry, Ricky.

116
00:06:49,418 --> 00:06:51,088
I thought he was still in jail.

117
00:06:52,444 --> 00:06:54,539
- When did he get out?
- Eight months ago.

118
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:57,876
He kept saying he was gonna call you,
but I guess he...

119
00:06:58,238 --> 00:07:01,379
He never got around to it. It's okay.
We hadn't talked in a long time.

120
00:07:01,545 --> 00:07:03,798
I know you two had your differences,

121
00:07:03,964 --> 00:07:05,342
but you'd have been surprised.

122
00:07:05,507 --> 00:07:07,093
Andre turned his life around.

123
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:08,794
I'm really glad to hear that.

124
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:10,637
It wasn't a hollow promise this time.

125
00:07:10,762 --> 00:07:14,102
I mean, he was working in the community,
trying to make a difference.

126
00:07:14,227 --> 00:07:15,810
All he wanted to do

127
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:18,435
was make his little girls proud.

128
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,942
Do the cops know who did this?

129
00:07:23,408 --> 00:07:26,071
Honestly?
They don't care.

130
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:29,526
They just figure Andre
got back in the game and...

131
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,148
Got killed for it.

132
00:07:32,273 --> 00:07:34,537
But I know that is not true.

133
00:07:34,703 --> 00:07:36,331
Andre made some mistakes,

134
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,666
but I've always known
he had a good heart.

135
00:07:40,576 --> 00:07:42,274
You should eat something, honey.

136
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,160
I'll make you a plate.

137
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,346
If there's anything you need...
you don't hesitate to call me.

138
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:55,850
There is one thing.
I need to talk to you for a minute...

139
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:58,937
Outside.

140
00:08:04,299 --> 00:08:06,361
I found this burner in Andre's car.

141
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,988
He got five calls
from a blocked number yesterday.

142
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:11,491
If we can figure out who made 'em,
I think we find his killer.

143
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,317
- Why didn't you give this to the police?
- Come on, man.

144
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:16,486
Cops don't cut
their coffee breaks short

145
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:18,998
to find out who called
a dead ex-con in Overtown.

146
00:08:19,164 --> 00:08:21,094
I have a friend
who can trace the blocked calls,

147
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:22,235
but...

148
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,255
Are you sure you want me to do this?
You might not like what we find.

149
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:28,633
Now, I know you gave up on Andre
a long time ago and I get it

150
00:08:29,104 --> 00:08:30,552
but I never did.

151
00:08:31,047 --> 00:08:32,595
Now, I just need to know the truth.

152
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,060
I'll look into it.

153
00:08:44,606 --> 00:08:47,610
<i>The advantage of having
a GPS tracker on a vehicle</i>

154
00:08:47,776 --> 00:08:50,764
<i>is it allows you to stay close
to your target without being seen.</i>

155
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:54,075
Okay, Anson just turned left again.
He's back on Biscayne.

156
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:55,410
- Again?
- Yeah.

157
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,495
Guy's driving around in circles
like he's Pac-Man.

158
00:08:57,661 --> 00:09:00,774
He must be worried about being followed.
Maybe he's going someplace important.

159
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:02,208
Okay.
He just turned right.

160
00:09:04,564 --> 00:09:05,462
He stopped.

161
00:09:05,627 --> 00:09:08,006
4th and Elm. Fi, get there. Let's go!

162
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,962
<i>The disadvantage a following
someone without visual contact</i>

163
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:12,756
<i>is that
when they get out of their car,</i>

164
00:09:12,881 --> 00:09:15,305
<i>you've got to catch up in a hurry
or risk losing them.</i>

165
00:09:23,406 --> 00:09:24,564
There he is.

166
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,107
Damn it.

167
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:27,916
Dollars to doughnuts
he's heading home,

168
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,139
but there's no way to follow him
without getting made.

169
00:09:32,055 --> 00:09:33,781
If we get a better vantage point,

170
00:09:33,947 --> 00:09:35,325
we won't have to follow him.

171
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,100
Fi, no. No, no, no.

172
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,041
Come on.
Slow down.

173
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,849
You said you wanted to go faster.

174
00:09:51,715 --> 00:09:52,800
Van!

175
00:09:52,966 --> 00:09:54,344
You're distracting the driver.

176
00:10:06,552 --> 00:10:08,900
There he is.
3 blocks, 11:00.

177
00:10:11,985 --> 00:10:15,156
- Now we know where the bastard sleeps.
- Don't spike the ball just yet.

178
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:16,991
There's got to be 300 units in it.

179
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,143
We can't knock on every door
until we find him.

180
00:10:19,268 --> 00:10:21,412
No...
But it's a start, Sam.

181
00:10:21,578 --> 00:10:23,998
<i>Whether it's espionage,
international gunrunning,</i>

182
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:26,876
<i>or managing a local street gang,</i>

183
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,505
<i>the preferred method of communication used
by people involved in illegal activity</i>

184
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,173
<i>is the burner phone.</i>

185
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:33,532
<i>Cheap and disposable,</i>

186
00:10:33,657 --> 00:10:35,885
<i>they can be used a few times
and thrown away...</i>

187
00:10:36,051 --> 00:10:38,455
<i>which means, if you're using
one to trace someone,</i>

188
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,256
<i>you've got to move fast.</i>

189
00:10:41,598 --> 00:10:45,270
So, I had one of the techs at my firm
trace the calls on your brother's phone

190
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:47,010
to that house right there.

191
00:10:47,135 --> 00:10:50,066
- Did you get a name?
- The calls came from another burner.

192
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,110
Last one was
about a half-hour before...

193
00:10:52,804 --> 00:10:53,903
Andre was...

194
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,488
All right.

195
00:10:55,654 --> 00:10:58,206
- Let's go find out who he was talking to.
- Way ahead of you.

196
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:02,229
Figure I'll take the front.
You take the back.

197
00:11:02,893 --> 00:11:04,330
You got one for me?

198
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,334
You should stay in the car,
just kind of...

199
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,504
Whoever's in that house either
killed my brother or set him up.

200
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,630
You don't know.

201
00:11:12,796 --> 00:11:14,632
- That's why I'm going in.
- Slow down.

202
00:11:15,377 --> 00:11:17,594
There's a chance whoever's in there
might know who you are.

203
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:21,556
Now, you asked for my help.
Trust me and stay back.

204
00:11:24,388 --> 00:11:26,060
All right.
Do your thing.

205
00:11:26,226 --> 00:11:28,273
<i>It's a good idea
to keep your initial contact</i>

206
00:11:28,398 --> 00:11:31,232
<i>with someone who might be dangerous
non-threatening.</i>

207
00:11:31,398 --> 00:11:33,249
<i>You're a lot less likely
to get shot at.</i>

208
00:11:33,374 --> 00:11:34,694
Miami Gas and Electric.

209
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,697
We got a report
of a leak in the area. Hello!

210
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,661
<i>Although just because
something's less likely</i>

211
00:11:43,827 --> 00:11:45,580
<i>doesn't mean it never happens.</i>

212
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,016
Get the hell off me!

213
00:12:05,557 --> 00:12:06,934
I don't think so.

214
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,937
Dolly?
What the hell are you doing here?

215
00:12:10,103 --> 00:12:10,979
You know her?

216
00:12:11,104 --> 00:12:12,482
I thought you were friends.

217
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,317
Why did you kill my brother?

218
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,735
I didn't kill Andre!

219
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,780
- Why were you trying to kill me?
- I didn't know who you were.

220
00:12:20,394 --> 00:12:21,824
Who did you think we were?

221
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,535
- Who killed him?
- I don't know!

222
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:26,537
I ain't telling y'all anything.
Let me go!

223
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,727
Let's take a little ride.

224
00:12:32,371 --> 00:12:35,311
I know you're not feeling chatty
but we need to have a conversation.

225
00:12:35,739 --> 00:12:38,308
Y'all ain't cops.
I don't have to tell you a damn thing.

226
00:12:38,433 --> 00:12:39,751
No. We're not.

227
00:12:40,954 --> 00:12:43,846
But we're happy to take you to them,
along with this.

228
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,431
Come on.

229
00:12:45,597 --> 00:12:48,373
We both know a convicted felon
can't walk around with a gun.

230
00:12:48,498 --> 00:12:50,231
You ready to go back to lockup?

231
00:12:51,754 --> 00:12:54,065
Dolly, listen to me...

232
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,734
I promise none of this
comes back on you.

233
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,738
I want to know who killed him.

234
00:13:05,037 --> 00:13:06,452
Dion Carver.

235
00:13:10,485 --> 00:13:13,715
Dion's a gangster
from the Magic City Overlords.

236
00:13:15,076 --> 00:13:17,463
I guess Andre
got back in the game after all.

237
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,216
Andre wasn't doing dirt.

238
00:13:20,688 --> 00:13:22,760
He's been on the up-and-up
since he got out of prison.

239
00:13:23,161 --> 00:13:25,805
Y'all heard the shot caller
of the Overlords got killed last month?

240
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,225
Yeah, well, the street's
been hot ever since...

241
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:32,019
people pointing fingers,
stirring up old beefs.

242
00:13:32,185 --> 00:13:34,287
Andre said the only way
to cool things down

243
00:13:34,412 --> 00:13:36,074
was to find out who really did it.

244
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:38,943
He figured out it was Dion
and got killed for it.

245
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,354
You told Andre who did it?

246
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:43,328
How did you know it was Dion?

247
00:13:44,128 --> 00:13:46,713
Dion and I, sometimes...

248
00:13:47,937 --> 00:13:49,620
You know, we see each other.

249
00:13:50,492 --> 00:13:53,040
And one night,
he comes home covered in blood,

250
00:13:53,206 --> 00:13:54,792
carrying two duffel bags.

251
00:13:55,285 --> 00:13:56,483
Thought I was asleep.

252
00:13:57,415 --> 00:13:59,497
I looked in the bags
when he was in the shower.

253
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:02,842
I've never seen so much cash.

254
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,636
So Dion robbed and killed
the leader of his own gang?

255
00:14:05,802 --> 00:14:07,472
I told Andre what I knew.

256
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,224
I thought that I was helping,

257
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,393
and now Dion's gunning for me.

258
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:14,000
You can still help Andre.

259
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,564
First, we need to find
someplace safe for you.

260
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,271
- What are you thinking?
- We're gonna take down Dion,

261
00:14:20,396 --> 00:14:22,069
like your brother wanted.

262
00:14:22,598 --> 00:14:25,072
Seriously, you stashed Dolly
at your mom's place?

263
00:14:25,238 --> 00:14:27,649
Yes. Now, can we borrow
the Porsche or not?

264
00:14:27,774 --> 00:14:30,787
Listen, Dolly knows everything we need
to pin Dion for killing that gangster.

265
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,497
She should be at the police station.

266
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,179
No. Dion and the O.G. he killed
were like brothers.

267
00:14:35,304 --> 00:14:36,750
It'd be his word against Dolly's.

268
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,971
And the words of known junkies
aren't worth much down at the precinct.

269
00:14:40,096 --> 00:14:41,964
Unless we can prove Dion had motive.

270
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,842
And to do that, we need to get him out
in the open with the stolen cash.

271
00:14:45,008 --> 00:14:46,922
Now, Dolly said
he's gearing up for war.

272
00:14:47,047 --> 00:14:49,658
I already called, told him
I have a friend selling heavy weapons.

273
00:14:49,783 --> 00:14:50,876
He is ready to meet.

274
00:14:51,001 --> 00:14:54,236
Okay, okay. Listen,
I hate to rain on this parade.

275
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:57,814
Dion's not gonna make million-dollar deal
if a witness knows how he got the cash.

276
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,317
- We're gonna make the deal sweet.
- Yeah, you hope, but saying that...

277
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:05,196
I turned my back on a friend.
And now he's dead.

278
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:10,326
I can't make that right,
but I can take down his killer.

279
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,766
We're gonna get Dion
to bring out the stolen cash,

280
00:15:12,891 --> 00:15:15,546
and we're gonna take the cash
and Dolly to the cops.

281
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:19,919
I'm not asking you for permission.
I'm asking to borrow your car.

282
00:15:20,603 --> 00:15:22,672
All right...
Under one condition...

283
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,090
I make the approach.

284
00:15:25,298 --> 00:15:27,505
Mike, this is way too personal
for both of you.

285
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:30,651
Ricky has to be there to make the intro.
Someone's got to keep a level head.

286
00:15:30,776 --> 00:15:32,723
I should be the one
that goes in there with him.

287
00:15:33,311 --> 00:15:34,684
All right, Jesse.
You're in.

288
00:15:56,101 --> 00:15:58,420
I'm still broke up
about what happened to Andre.

289
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,714
He was like family to me, man.

290
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:05,715
You have no idea how much that means
coming from you.

291
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,033
Who we got here?

292
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,341
Dion,

293
00:16:08,896 --> 00:16:12,138
this is Khalil, the friend I was
telling you about from Los Angeles.

294
00:16:13,566 --> 00:16:15,099
- What's up?
- You run guns?

295
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,434
I run security.

296
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,803
You hear about a rapper getting busted
on a yacht, you can blame my ass.

297
00:16:19,928 --> 00:16:21,229
Let's just put it like that.

298
00:16:21,354 --> 00:16:23,718
- So, what you got for me?
- I'm glad you asked.

299
00:16:28,111 --> 00:16:30,239
Your man asked me a question.
May I please?

300
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:33,455
You got them trained.
I like that.

301
00:16:36,671 --> 00:16:38,228
It's a Desert Eagle.

302
00:16:38,353 --> 00:16:40,364
It's the most powerful gun
on the streets,

303
00:16:40,489 --> 00:16:42,919
and it is a cap gun
compared to what we're selling.

304
00:16:43,473 --> 00:16:44,712
I'm talking USAS-12S,

305
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:47,798
RPGs, body armor,
night-vision scopes.

306
00:16:47,964 --> 00:16:49,972
You name it.
We're calling it the...

307
00:16:50,813 --> 00:16:52,428
the "Scarface" deluxe package.

308
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,388
But wait, there's more...

309
00:16:54,824 --> 00:16:56,098
Everything half price.

310
00:16:56,264 --> 00:16:57,430
What's the catch?

311
00:16:57,555 --> 00:16:59,894
My dude wants to unload
the whole shipment for a million.

312
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,355
And what am I supposed to do
with all that artillery?

313
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:03,948
Use your imagination.

314
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:06,486
You arm your whole crew to the gills,
you sell the rest.

315
00:17:06,611 --> 00:17:08,774
How much an M60 going for
on the streets right now, Rick?

316
00:17:08,899 --> 00:17:11,068
Let me see.
Let me get out my little calculator.

317
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:12,657
A lot.

318
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:16,043
You'll quadruple your profit.
Think about it.

319
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:17,745
You'll never make that slinging dope.

320
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,998
Why am I trying to convince this dude?
I thought you said he was a player.

321
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,765
This dude is standing in front of you.
He the biggest player in Overtown.

322
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,543
Look, I get it. I see this
all the time in the music biz.

323
00:17:28,668 --> 00:17:30,952
Talented cats, spotlight comes on...

324
00:17:32,855 --> 00:17:33,905
Shrinks up.

325
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,806
Can't everybody handle the big time.

326
00:17:37,675 --> 00:17:40,223
I'm sure you can get your hands
on some MAC-10s,

327
00:17:40,348 --> 00:17:41,560
maybe street sweepers.

328
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:42,855
But guess what.

329
00:17:43,275 --> 00:17:45,378
So can everybody else
you got a beef with.

330
00:17:45,503 --> 00:17:47,082
I'm trying to provide you

331
00:17:47,207 --> 00:17:50,059
with the opportunity
to separate yourself from the pack.

332
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:54,213
But I can see you ain't ready.
So have a nice life.

333
00:17:55,672 --> 00:17:57,377
- I didn't say no.
- All right.

334
00:17:58,058 --> 00:18:00,538
Now, first off, I want a demonstration
of what I'm buying.

335
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,206
And I want to meet your supplier.

336
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:05,042
If it turn out
that you're wasting my time, partner,

337
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,710
knowing Ricky ain't gonna help you.

338
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:09,463
You feel me?

339
00:18:10,075 --> 00:18:11,704
Yeah, I feel you, D.

340
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:13,216
<i>A tough reality of surveillance</i>

341
00:18:13,341 --> 00:18:16,092
<i>is that no matter how many hours
you spend outside a building,</i>

342
00:18:16,217 --> 00:18:18,014
<i>you can't see through walls.</i>

343
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,962
<i>So, if you want to learn
which unit in an apartment complex</i>

344
00:18:21,087 --> 00:18:24,270
<i>your target is using
without raising his suspicion,</i>

345
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,454
<i>you need to find someone else
to go in for you.</i>

346
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:28,565
<i>College campuses are a great place</i>

347
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,898
<i>to find a highly intelligent
and enthusiastic workforce.</i>

348
00:18:32,023 --> 00:18:34,155
<i>The student body
may not get up before noon,</i>

349
00:18:34,602 --> 00:18:36,866
<i>but they'll be eager
to give you their free time,</i>

350
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,725
<i>if you can come up
with a worthy cause.</i>

351
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:42,419
We've been contacted by a group with
a proposal to fight corporate waste.

352
00:18:42,544 --> 00:18:45,916
Guys, join me in welcoming environmental
attorney Mr. Charles Finley.

353
00:18:46,713 --> 00:18:47,543
Thank you.

354
00:18:47,963 --> 00:18:49,123
Thanks, Dakota.

355
00:18:49,248 --> 00:18:53,549
It's really heartening to see so many
young people working to save the world.

356
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:54,965
But did you know

357
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:58,095
that there are wonderful opportunities
to do some good right here in Miami?

358
00:18:58,261 --> 00:19:00,264
For example,
there are some condo complexes

359
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,191
with carbon footprints
that are larger than Sri Lanka.

360
00:19:05,849 --> 00:19:06,641
A country.

361
00:19:06,951 --> 00:19:09,133
Mr. Finley's firm
is leading a class-action lawsuit

362
00:19:09,258 --> 00:19:10,888
against the Marina Parkway complex.

363
00:19:11,013 --> 00:19:13,181
That's right,
because they are the worst offenders

364
00:19:13,306 --> 00:19:15,665
of nonrenewable energy
east of the Mississippi.

365
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:18,227
And for some reason
they're getting tax breaks

366
00:19:18,352 --> 00:19:20,034
for being "energy efficient".

367
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,787
Are you kidding me?
We got to put a stop to this.

368
00:19:23,178 --> 00:19:25,985
So I need you to document
every tenant in that complex

369
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:30,002
so that we can calculate the ratio
of power suckage to tenants

370
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:31,420
on said properties.

371
00:19:31,802 --> 00:19:33,798
We need volunteers
to knock on every door,

372
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,424
on every window, on every gate.

373
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,343
We got to get that information out.

374
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,846
It is time to hold
the Marina Parkway accountable!

375
00:19:43,514 --> 00:19:45,267
- I have a question.
- Yes, sir?

376
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,747
I assume your firm will earn
a third of the damages if you win.

377
00:19:49,202 --> 00:19:52,650
- Are we being paid for this canvassing?
- What are you, kid? Pre-law?

378
00:19:53,406 --> 00:19:55,069
Listen, I don't know about you,

379
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,974
but the satisfaction
of stopping an ice cap from melting

380
00:19:58,099 --> 00:19:59,782
or saving a nest of baby penguins...

381
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,326
is all the payment I need.

382
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,632
Where's Sam? You talk to him
about coming to the deal?

383
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,304
Dion said it's a non-starter
if he doesn't meet the supplier.

384
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:25,516
- He'll meet the supplier: me.
- You not in the right frame of mind...

385
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,694
I've had plenty of time
to get my head straight.

386
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:30,813
I'm not sending anyone else to scam
a cold-blooded killer with a gun deal.

387
00:20:31,075 --> 00:20:32,523
Besides, we have bigger problems.

388
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:33,739
Like what?

389
00:20:33,864 --> 00:20:35,557
Like, I can't get the guns.

390
00:20:35,682 --> 00:20:37,528
What?
Mike said it wouldn't be a problem.

391
00:20:38,092 --> 00:20:39,530
Wishful thinking.

392
00:20:40,025 --> 00:20:41,766
I don't have that kind of inventory,

393
00:20:41,891 --> 00:20:43,993
especially since I've had
to keep a low profile lately.

394
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,705
People, the wheels are in motion here.
This is happening. I can't hit "rewind."

395
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:48,997
We might not have to.

396
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:52,126
Fi happens to know where one of
her "associates" keeps his inventory.

397
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,200
- So you want to steal the guns?
- No.

398
00:20:54,325 --> 00:20:56,630
We'll sneak in,
do the demonstration, sneak out.

399
00:20:57,984 --> 00:20:59,466
Except that's crazy.

400
00:21:00,053 --> 00:21:01,385
Doesn't mean it won't work.

401
00:21:01,905 --> 00:21:04,689
All right. I'm calling Sam.
We're definitely gonna need some backup.

402
00:21:05,939 --> 00:21:07,141
<i>Like con-artists,</i>

403
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:10,178
<i>spies sometimes find themselves
in the unique position</i>

404
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:12,062
<i>of selling things
they don't actually own.</i>

405
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,474
<i>To close the deal,</i>

406
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,409
<i>you just need a believable story
and a lot of confidence.</i>

407
00:21:16,534 --> 00:21:18,819
<i>Of course, when your cover ID
is a weapons supplier</i>

408
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,280
<i>who's crazy enough
to deal with a murdering gangster,</i>

409
00:21:21,985 --> 00:21:24,575
<i>it doesn't hurt
to act a little crazy, too.</i>

410
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:29,111
I trust Khalil made it clear. We have
a small window to make this deal happen.

411
00:21:29,236 --> 00:21:31,373
You're trying
to make room for a new shipment.

412
00:21:31,731 --> 00:21:33,606
But you don't move good product
at half price

413
00:21:33,731 --> 00:21:35,460
just 'cause you want
to clear floor space.

414
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:38,047
So, tell me, why the rush?

415
00:21:42,773 --> 00:21:43,719
You got me.

416
00:21:44,682 --> 00:21:47,640
Chalk it up to a banking error,
as in my banker is dead.

417
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,226
Cash flow has been turned off,

418
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:53,898
and I've made certain promises
to certain Colombians that must be kept.

419
00:21:54,023 --> 00:21:57,942
So if we're gonna make this deal happen,
we just need to do it right now.

420
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,557
Show me what I'm buying.

421
00:22:00,795 --> 00:22:02,071
Where do we begin?

422
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,241
Looks like Mike's doing okay in here.

423
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,494
- Just wish he'd hurry up.
- He'll be fine.

424
00:22:09,315 --> 00:22:12,623
You are supposed to look the road,
make sure there are no surprises.

425
00:22:14,085 --> 00:22:15,275
Feast your eyes on this.

426
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:18,128
USAS-12 shotgun.

427
00:22:18,494 --> 00:22:19,755
Take it for a test-drive.

428
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,182
You feel that?
That is sexy, right?

429
00:22:32,177 --> 00:22:34,728
I got a silver 4x4 heading our way.

430
00:22:34,894 --> 00:22:36,689
I thought you said
no one would be here.

431
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,692
I can't control it if someone
stops by the office on a Sunday.

432
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,005
That guy makes a surprise visit
Mike and Jesse are dead.

433
00:22:42,433 --> 00:22:45,281
- What the hell is that?
- Gas grenade. I come prepared.

434
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:49,159
Excuse me, sir.
Can I talk to you a moment?

435
00:22:52,068 --> 00:22:53,706
Easy, fella.
It'll be over soon.

436
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,916
What's going on?
Whose truck is that?

437
00:22:58,042 --> 00:22:59,461
<i>You almost had a party crasher.</i>

438
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,255
We stopped him, but not quietly.

439
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:04,300
My associate was just asking
about that truck.

440
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,303
Better make up a good story.

441
00:23:07,134 --> 00:23:09,013
Thanks.
That is great news.

442
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,262
Just make sure
the blast area is clear.

443
00:23:11,387 --> 00:23:14,935
Dion, I had that truck brought in
for a little demonstration.

444
00:23:15,101 --> 00:23:17,146
Now, for the grand finale.

445
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:20,733
You can't truly appreciate an RPG,

446
00:23:21,298 --> 00:23:24,570
until you have held it in your arms
like your firstborn child.

447
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,603
Just imagine your enemies

448
00:23:26,728 --> 00:23:28,708
coming down the street for a drive-by

449
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:31,511
and they don't know
you've got this in your arms.

450
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:37,333
Make it sing, baby.
Make it sing.

451
00:23:51,286 --> 00:23:52,306
So, we got a deal?

452
00:23:52,744 --> 00:23:54,975
Let's just say I'm gonna need
to stop by an ATM.

453
00:23:57,977 --> 00:24:00,522
<i>Whether it's getting a bureaucrat
to hand over state secrets</i>

454
00:24:00,688 --> 00:24:03,609
<i>or a gangster to bring out the stolen
money that will get him busted,</i>

455
00:24:03,858 --> 00:24:07,112
<i>spies know convincing people
to take action when they don't want to</i>

456
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,705
<i>is only half the battle.</i>

457
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:11,825
<i>The hard part is making them
do it on your schedule.</i>

458
00:24:11,991 --> 00:24:14,870
Dion called. He needs a week
to pull together the money for the deal.

459
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,206
A week? The man's sitting
on a million dollars.

460
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:20,423
A million dollars that we need him
to bring out for your plan to work.

461
00:24:20,548 --> 00:24:21,591
He's stalling.

462
00:24:21,716 --> 00:24:24,088
He's just trying to buy time
until he finds Dolly.

463
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,850
She's the only person
who knows he stole the cash.

464
00:24:26,975 --> 00:24:28,842
He'll want to kill her
before he spends it.

465
00:24:29,008 --> 00:24:30,802
We're not waiting
for him to hunt her down.

466
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:33,137
But what else can we do?
He already heard the sales pitch.

467
00:24:33,262 --> 00:24:35,986
We need to make sure
he knows he's got to act now.

468
00:24:36,111 --> 00:24:38,143
Mike, you push him too hard,
you could get killed.

469
00:24:38,309 --> 00:24:40,229
That's why we need a plan
in case it gets ugly.

470
00:24:40,718 --> 00:24:43,357
Jesse and I are gonna talk to Dion.
Jesse's keys are gonna be bugged.

471
00:24:43,888 --> 00:24:45,886
I need you and Fi close by,
listening in.

472
00:24:46,011 --> 00:24:48,112
You know the players in Dion's crew
better than us.

473
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,885
If you sense something going wrong,
you can give me a heads-up.

474
00:24:51,849 --> 00:24:52,866
I'll get my stuff.

475
00:24:56,677 --> 00:24:57,788
Mr. Carver,

476
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:01,291
when I said I needed this
to happen now,

477
00:25:01,457 --> 00:25:02,794
<i>I meant right now!</i>

478
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:04,211
<i>I'm doing a deal tomorrow</i>

479
00:25:04,676 --> 00:25:06,755
with you or without you.

480
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:09,883
What in the hell
is that supposed to mean?

481
00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:12,587
You talking to other buyers?

482
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,036
This is
a once-in-a-lifetime deal, dawg.

483
00:25:15,161 --> 00:25:17,309
You thought
we wouldn't explore other options?

484
00:25:17,434 --> 00:25:18,435
Come on, now.

485
00:25:19,058 --> 00:25:20,561
You forgot to do your homework.

486
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,520
The last fool who backed out
of a deal on me

487
00:25:22,645 --> 00:25:24,523
he had a real nice funeral.

488
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:25,732
Hey, D.

489
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:28,944
Hector just called.

490
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,041
Somebody saw your girl
on Rows on 5th,

491
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:32,781
and she about to catch a fade,
player.

492
00:25:32,947 --> 00:25:34,491
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

493
00:25:34,657 --> 00:25:36,910
Hey, Billy,
break out a bottle of Dom.

494
00:25:40,371 --> 00:25:42,124
What?
What did they just say?

495
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,792
Hector is one of Dion's shooters.

496
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:45,711
Sounds like the gang
just found Dolly.

497
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,379
She's supposed to be at Madeline's.

498
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:50,048
I guess she left. They just said
she was going to catch a fade.

499
00:25:50,214 --> 00:25:52,604
- "Catch a fade" means...
- She's getting shot in the head.

500
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:55,137
- How do I get to the Row?
- It's an alley at 5th and Jensen.

501
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,355
You know how a banger from Overtown

502
00:26:05,521 --> 00:26:07,866
who was never the biggest
or smartest, even,

503
00:26:07,991 --> 00:26:09,735
ends up in a place like this?

504
00:26:10,693 --> 00:26:11,545
Vision.

505
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,530
That's great,
but I don't need your champagne.

506
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,934
- I need a deal.
- Relax.

507
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:21,163
The last little obstacle to our business
has been taken care of.

508
00:26:21,593 --> 00:26:23,957
I'm a do you one better
than your deal, Mr. Turner.

509
00:26:24,123 --> 00:26:25,334
A hell of a lot better.

510
00:26:41,943 --> 00:26:43,018
Dolly...

511
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:46,142
- Hey, Ricky.
- What happened?

512
00:26:46,267 --> 00:26:49,316
I was feeling so bad.
I just needed a fix.

513
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,319
I'm gonna be fine.

514
00:26:53,143 --> 00:26:54,404
I'll tell 'em what I know.

515
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:56,865
I want you to save your energy now.

516
00:26:57,031 --> 00:26:58,231
I'm gonna...

517
00:27:05,363 --> 00:27:06,416
Come on, now.

518
00:27:06,812 --> 00:27:07,825
Come on.

519
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:11,299
Dolly, you stay with me, girl.

520
00:27:12,755 --> 00:27:13,966
She's gone.

521
00:27:14,832 --> 00:27:15,957
She's gone.

522
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,207
We got to get out of here.

523
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:21,765
Right now. We've got to go.
Come on. Go.

524
00:27:23,816 --> 00:27:25,596
<i>Part of being a good operative</i>

525
00:27:25,721 --> 00:27:28,104
<i>is knowing what to do
when things go wrong.</i>

526
00:27:28,392 --> 00:27:31,595
<i>If an entire operation
depends on a single witness to a crime</i>

527
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,277
<i>and that witness gets murdered,</i>

528
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:34,943
<i>you've got a hard choice to make.</i>

529
00:27:35,109 --> 00:27:38,214
<i>Risk more lives or cut your losses
while you still can.</i>

530
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:39,668
I've got more bad news.

531
00:27:39,793 --> 00:27:41,243
Now that Dolly's out of the way,

532
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:44,580
Dion didn't just go for the deal.
He wants me to be his new supplier.

533
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:47,082
So instead of going to jail,
he's making a power play?

534
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:48,780
Without Dolly to tell the truth,

535
00:27:48,905 --> 00:27:50,961
he can make up any excuse
about how he got the money.

536
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:52,705
Then he's got nothing to fear.

537
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:55,193
Jesse and I are meeting him
at Stubby's tomorrow.

538
00:27:55,564 --> 00:27:57,948
Now, we're gonna tell Dion
our shipment was delayed,

539
00:27:58,073 --> 00:28:00,178
but we won't be able to keep up
that charade for long.

540
00:28:00,344 --> 00:28:02,764
- Why go to the meeting at all?
- To buy you time.

541
00:28:03,216 --> 00:28:05,225
You need to leave town.
Tomorrow.

542
00:28:05,391 --> 00:28:08,979
- Andre's funeral is Thursday.
- I know, but it won't be safe for you.

543
00:28:09,318 --> 00:28:10,704
Once the gun deal goes bad,

544
00:28:10,829 --> 00:28:12,941
Dion will come after you
for setting it up.

545
00:28:13,107 --> 00:28:16,320
Sam's working on a new ID.
You get whatever cash you can...

546
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:20,209
So Dion gets to walk around
with a pile of cash

547
00:28:20,334 --> 00:28:22,532
and Andre's blood on his hands?

548
00:28:22,657 --> 00:28:26,330
And I'm supposed to get on a bus
with a fake name and some pocket change?

549
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,790
It's just until we figure out
another way to take him down.

550
00:28:28,956 --> 00:28:30,876
You said this would work!

551
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,252
You gave me your word.

552
00:28:32,418 --> 00:28:34,212
I'm sorry, Ricky.
I am trying.

553
00:28:38,971 --> 00:28:40,344
It's not your fault, Mike.

554
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:44,056
It just is what it is.

555
00:28:50,627 --> 00:28:51,396
Damn it!

556
00:28:56,823 --> 00:28:57,824
<i>Hey, Fi.</i>

557
00:28:58,248 --> 00:28:59,863
<i>Finley's army came through.</i>

558
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:02,908
Looks like the kids narrowed down
the hunt for Anson to three condos.

559
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,962
Great,
we'll figure out which one's his...

560
00:29:05,087 --> 00:29:07,664
right after I drop off
Ricky's get-out-of-town package.

561
00:29:08,698 --> 00:29:09,495
Hey, Fi.

562
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:13,171
I'm sorry things went bad.
You know, it's just a bump in the road.

563
00:29:14,037 --> 00:29:16,953
Here, fake ID, credit cards,
new cellphone.

564
00:29:17,405 --> 00:29:20,008
- If I were you, I would head out west.
- Can you do me a favor?

565
00:29:20,915 --> 00:29:22,844
Tell Mike not to worry
about making that meeting.

566
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:25,025
He's going.
He wouldn't leave you hanging like that.

567
00:29:25,179 --> 00:29:26,458
You don't understand.

568
00:29:26,923 --> 00:29:29,142
He cannot go to that meeting.

569
00:29:29,761 --> 00:29:30,892
It's not safe.

570
00:29:32,831 --> 00:29:36,301
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Just give him the message.

571
00:29:36,426 --> 00:29:37,526
Please.

572
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:46,201
- What do you need fertilizer for?
- Just reseeded the backyard.

573
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:47,703
Wire cutters?

574
00:29:50,752 --> 00:29:51,753
Kerosene.

575
00:29:52,154 --> 00:29:53,709
Jesus, Ricky.
You made a bomb.

576
00:29:53,974 --> 00:29:55,010
Like I said.

577
00:29:55,608 --> 00:29:57,796
Tell Mike to skip the meeting.

578
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,095
Screw that.

579
00:30:02,973 --> 00:30:04,219
You can tell him yourself.

580
00:30:06,613 --> 00:30:08,724
<i>As a spy, you get use to the idea,</i>

581
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,143
<i>that today's enemy
could be tomorrow's friend.</i>

582
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,687
<i>Unfortunately,
it also works the other way around.</i>

583
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:17,209
<i>Under the wrong conditions, your friends
could turn into adversaries.</i>

584
00:30:17,334 --> 00:30:19,276
<i>And the closer they are,
the worse it is.</i>

585
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:21,541
We're running out of time.
Where is the bomb?

586
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:23,165
I said no.

587
00:30:23,832 --> 00:30:25,963
I'm sorry,
but Dion's gonna get what he deserves.

588
00:30:26,088 --> 00:30:27,617
Dion's not the only person in there.

589
00:30:27,783 --> 00:30:29,570
Everybody in there
has blood on their hands!

590
00:30:29,882 --> 00:30:31,775
This isn't the right way, Ricky.

591
00:30:32,442 --> 00:30:33,457
It's the only way.

592
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:36,221
I take out
all the Overlord shot callers in one go,

593
00:30:36,346 --> 00:30:37,878
maybe there'll be peace in Overtown.

594
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:40,464
You do that,
you will only make it worse.

595
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:44,301
Dion shot Andrew down like a dog.
He left him in the street.

596
00:30:45,655 --> 00:30:47,721
And I want him to pay
as much as you do.

597
00:30:48,201 --> 00:30:49,978
But don't let him
turn you into a murderer.

598
00:30:50,103 --> 00:30:52,517
Andre wouldn't want that,
and neither do I.

599
00:30:55,258 --> 00:30:56,730
So we just let Dion walk away?

600
00:30:57,047 --> 00:30:58,648
No, you let me take care of this.

601
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:00,108
You trust me.

602
00:31:00,274 --> 00:31:01,690
I will take him down.

603
00:31:02,745 --> 00:31:04,446
But you got to tell me
where the bomb is.

604
00:31:09,787 --> 00:31:12,507
There's a storage room
in the ground floor,

605
00:31:12,632 --> 00:31:14,232
right under where they're meeting.

606
00:31:14,357 --> 00:31:17,083
I snuck in through the alley
in the back. There's a door there.

607
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:20,003
It's Dion.
What should I tell him?

608
00:31:20,508 --> 00:31:22,120
You tell him we're on our way.

609
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:25,247
- Shouldn't we be defusing the bomb?
- I don't want you to defuse it.

610
00:31:25,372 --> 00:31:27,502
We're gonna make a tweak on it,
use it to our advantage.

611
00:31:28,347 --> 00:31:30,263
It's back there,
right behind those boxes.

612
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,792
Really think
we should just turn this thing off.

613
00:31:37,084 --> 00:31:39,272
Whatever Michael's planning,
it'll work with an explosion.

614
00:31:39,438 --> 00:31:42,651
This baby has to blow.
We'll just do it without killing anyone.

615
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,487
There's enough nitrate in here
to take out a city block.

616
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,823
- Where did you learn to do this?
- The Internet.

617
00:31:48,597 --> 00:31:50,148
Don't quit your day job.

618
00:31:51,283 --> 00:31:53,787
<i>A bomb's effectiveness
comes down to two factors,</i>

619
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:57,541
<i>the amount of fuel mixture used
and the location of the charge.</i>

620
00:32:02,215 --> 00:32:04,855
<i>If you want to create
the sensation of a big blast</i>

621
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,550
<i>without the devastating effects,</i>

622
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:10,428
<i>you need to reduce the explosives
and place the charge in an open space</i>

623
00:32:10,594 --> 00:32:12,576
<i>instead of against
a load-bearing wall.</i>

624
00:32:12,701 --> 00:32:15,900
<i>Do it right, and your explosion
will still have all the bark,</i>

625
00:32:16,308 --> 00:32:18,067
even if you take out
most of the bite.

626
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:19,312
She's ready.

627
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,907
Now, these are the guys
I been telling y'all about,

628
00:32:22,032 --> 00:32:24,025
the reason I called
for this sit-down.

629
00:32:24,191 --> 00:32:26,486
Now, it ain't no secret
these are some tough times.

630
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,155
We lost our leader.
Some of us have blamed each other.

631
00:32:29,455 --> 00:32:31,612
I want know who was behind it
as much as y'all do.

632
00:32:31,737 --> 00:32:35,328
But you know what I want even more?
I want to put food on my table.

633
00:32:35,611 --> 00:32:38,748
And I want to stop losing corners
to every gang in Miami.

634
00:32:39,028 --> 00:32:41,418
Now, our enemies
think the Overlords are weak now.

635
00:32:42,028 --> 00:32:43,209
They think we so busy

636
00:32:43,334 --> 00:32:45,797
pointing fingers at each other
that we can't handle our business.

637
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,966
It's time for us
to set the record straight.

638
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,845
This is Khalil and Mr. Turner.

639
00:32:52,636 --> 00:32:55,515
Thanks to these two,
the Overlords have a new revenue stream.

640
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,350
Guns, fellas.

641
00:33:01,197 --> 00:33:04,274
And now the only crew bringing
more heat than us is the National Guard.

642
00:33:05,612 --> 00:33:08,069
We have a problem,
a "let's talk outside" kind of problem.

643
00:33:11,183 --> 00:33:13,744
Man, are you crazy?
I called this meeting.

644
00:33:13,869 --> 00:33:17,495
I understand that. That's why
you'll want to hear what I have to say.

645
00:33:19,633 --> 00:33:22,023
All right, me and my boy right here,
we gonna have a little chat,

646
00:33:22,148 --> 00:33:23,872
go over some of the finer points.

647
00:33:23,997 --> 00:33:26,379
Now, Khalil, he'll walk y'all
through our first order.

648
00:33:26,691 --> 00:33:27,839
We'll be right back.

649
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:37,182
Anybody here know anything
about the USAS-12 automatic shotgun?

650
00:33:38,227 --> 00:33:39,309
All right.

651
00:33:39,927 --> 00:33:42,562
You got your little private moment.
Now, what the hell going on?

652
00:33:42,858 --> 00:33:44,230
There's been a little snag.

653
00:33:44,713 --> 00:33:48,026
My guy over at the ATF says
my warehouse is under surveillance.

654
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,652
Can't even go near it.

655
00:33:50,102 --> 00:33:52,238
This don't smell right.
You trying to play me?

656
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,770
I'm sorry to put a damper
on your day.

657
00:33:55,193 --> 00:33:57,869
I'm the one whose entire inventory
is off-limits.

658
00:33:59,518 --> 00:34:02,375
I warned you what was gonna happen
if you pulled out of the deal.

659
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,250
You don't believe me?
Here.

660
00:34:05,108 --> 00:34:06,357
Call this number.

661
00:34:07,507 --> 00:34:10,873
It's the ATF. You call that.
You ask for Agent Torres.

662
00:34:10,998 --> 00:34:12,907
You say you're a concerned citizen.

663
00:34:13,032 --> 00:34:14,033
All right.

664
00:34:14,617 --> 00:34:16,082
I'm-a call your bluff.

665
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:21,810
Moment of truth, Mr. Turner.

666
00:34:38,492 --> 00:34:41,788
- What the hell?
- You just blew up Stubby's. Let's go.

667
00:34:46,821 --> 00:34:49,713
- Can't believe they just did that.
- Did what? What the hell just happened?

668
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,346
Are you an idiot?

669
00:34:51,471 --> 00:34:52,924
They tried to blow us up.

670
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:57,387
Turner tries to screw me out of my cut,
and Dion made a play to run Overtown.

671
00:34:59,837 --> 00:35:01,431
Dion's crazy, but he'll never...

672
00:35:01,556 --> 00:35:03,893
Settle all his beefs in one shot?
He just did.

673
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,396
Or you think he's lucky,

674
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,898
walking out of here
a minute before the place went boom?

675
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:11,359
He probably set it off
with a cellphone or something.

676
00:35:11,722 --> 00:35:14,946
It's true. I saw Dion dial his phone
right before the blast.

677
00:35:15,261 --> 00:35:16,979
Dion's asking for a toe tag.

678
00:35:17,386 --> 00:35:19,117
- I say let's give it to him.
- Hell yeah.

679
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,118
Hell yeah.

680
00:35:27,335 --> 00:35:28,336
I see.

681
00:35:29,441 --> 00:35:32,255
- This is about Andre.
- About you murdering him? Yeah.

682
00:35:32,759 --> 00:35:34,265
What you gonna do, man?

683
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,342
Shoot me?

684
00:35:36,863 --> 00:35:38,970
Come on, Rick.
You ain't got the stones, man.

685
00:35:43,264 --> 00:35:44,768
I'm not gonna kill you,

686
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,686
but your gang is.

687
00:35:46,924 --> 00:35:48,813
They think you just tried
to blow them up.

688
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:50,900
Come on, man, you're crazy.

689
00:35:51,025 --> 00:35:53,494
I'll tell them what really happened.
They gonna be looking for you.

690
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:54,527
Why's that?

691
00:35:54,693 --> 00:35:56,613
His phone's not the one
that triggered the bomb.

692
00:35:56,996 --> 00:35:58,740
Cops can track things like that.

693
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:01,368
What do you think your friends
are gonna do when they find out?

694
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,161
Who do you think they'll come for?

695
00:36:06,884 --> 00:36:07,999
I am so sorry, man.

696
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:12,128
It hurts me to my soul, what I did.
But I can make it up to you, man.

697
00:36:12,598 --> 00:36:13,671
I can get you money.

698
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,983
Andre's little girls.
I'll set them up for life.

699
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:17,612
Anything you want!

700
00:36:19,074 --> 00:36:21,096
I want my brother back.

701
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,227
Can you make that happen?

702
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,979
The only way you get out of this
is to confess to Andre's murder.

703
00:36:31,947 --> 00:36:34,448
You think the Overlords
can't find me in prison, man?

704
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,652
You might as well shoot me now.

705
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,516
I won't last a day in there.

706
00:36:38,641 --> 00:36:41,908
Not if you cut a deal. You give up
what you know about the Overlords.

707
00:36:42,442 --> 00:36:45,620
They'll put you in isolation,
but at least you'll be alive.

708
00:36:45,886 --> 00:36:48,415
- That's more than you deserve.
- So, what's it gonna be, Dion?

709
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:51,209
Are we handing you to the cops
or throwing you to the wolves?

710
00:37:06,295 --> 00:37:09,035
Got a call from Sam's buddy
over at the Miami PD.

711
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:11,855
Dion made a full confession.

712
00:37:12,115 --> 00:37:13,273
He flipped on his gang.

713
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,625
He's in solitary
for the rest of his life.

714
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,469
Wherever Andre is right now,

715
00:37:18,447 --> 00:37:19,320
he's smiling.

716
00:37:25,856 --> 00:37:26,744
Thank you...

717
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,831
for talking me out
of what I wanted to do.

718
00:37:30,311 --> 00:37:32,041
I'd have regretted it
the rest of my life.

719
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:35,753
Don't mention it. I'm glad you pushed
for answers on your brother.

720
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,338
I'm sorry I doubted him.

721
00:37:38,615 --> 00:37:40,633
Do you boys remember the summer...

722
00:37:40,799 --> 00:37:42,931
you took the engine
out of my lawn mower...

723
00:37:43,147 --> 00:37:44,220
and built a go-kart?

724
00:37:44,461 --> 00:37:46,806
Andre drove that thing
like a mad man.

725
00:37:47,043 --> 00:37:48,766
"No fear. No fear, Michael."

726
00:37:48,932 --> 00:37:52,604
Except until he lost control and then
took out that rose bush. Remember that?

727
00:37:54,393 --> 00:37:56,399
Man had thorns in his eyelids.

728
00:37:57,232 --> 00:37:59,774
Andre never told you
that he came back a week later...

729
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,603
with an apology.

730
00:38:02,454 --> 00:38:03,835
And a new rose bush.

731
00:38:04,692 --> 00:38:06,459
He planted it all by himself.

732
00:38:09,286 --> 00:38:10,663
You're not saying that...

733
00:38:11,211 --> 00:38:12,499
These are from Andre.

734
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:17,921
Told you.

735
00:38:18,934 --> 00:38:20,381
He had a good heart.

736
00:38:23,303 --> 00:38:24,469
Thank you, Mrs. Westen.

737
00:38:25,149 --> 00:38:26,387
Okay, honey.

738
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,806
<i>Breaking into
a trained operative's place</i>

739
00:38:49,931 --> 00:38:52,038
<i>is an extremely dangerous
thing to do.</i>

740
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:55,720
<i>The consequences of getting caught
range from jail time to death.</i>

741
00:38:55,845 --> 00:38:58,518
<i>Making it crucial
to protect your team at all costs.</i>

742
00:38:58,643 --> 00:39:01,589
<i>That's why it's best to schedule
a break-in for a time...</i>

743
00:39:01,755 --> 00:39:04,008
<i>when you're sure your target
is going to be away from home.</i>

744
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,838
<i>Ideally
because they're meeting with you.</i>

745
00:39:08,465 --> 00:39:10,223
He just pulled up, Fi.
You guys get in yet?

746
00:39:10,777 --> 00:39:13,476
- Just made it in.
- You find anything, you call me.

747
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:16,436
Anson has gone out of his way
to keep this place a secret.

748
00:39:16,561 --> 00:39:17,991
We'll find something.

749
00:39:18,615 --> 00:39:19,691
Hey, Michael.

750
00:39:19,932 --> 00:39:21,400
I thought you'd be busy today.

751
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,418
Or am I already free and clear
of the CIA's systems?

752
00:39:24,543 --> 00:39:25,488
Not exactly.

753
00:39:26,499 --> 00:39:28,866
Maybe I overestimated
your affections for Fiona.

754
00:39:29,032 --> 00:39:30,561
I need to know before I go in there.

755
00:39:31,028 --> 00:39:33,535
Before I break
into the CIA's computers for you.

756
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,634
I need to know
that there is an end to this.

757
00:39:35,759 --> 00:39:37,968
Like a guarantee?
That everything's gonna be okay?

758
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:39,988
Would that make you feel better?

759
00:39:41,163 --> 00:39:42,418
That reminds me.

760
00:39:42,543 --> 00:39:44,882
I had the most interesting conversation
with your mom...

761
00:39:45,268 --> 00:39:47,510
in one of our sessions,
just touching.

762
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:48,777
Let's stay focused...

763
00:39:48,902 --> 00:39:52,390
Do you remember the time that you poured
all your dad's liquor down the drain?

764
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,393
You hated what happened when he drank.
And you thought you could fix it.

765
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,354
Your heart was in the right place,
but it didn't work out so well, did it?

766
00:39:59,538 --> 00:40:00,440
No, it didn't.

767
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:03,399
No, your dad went into a rage
and your mom got the worst of it.

768
00:40:03,524 --> 00:40:04,444
The point is,

769
00:40:04,704 --> 00:40:08,094
little Michael always thought
he could fix things, and I admire that.

770
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:10,205
But at some point,
you have to grow up.

771
00:40:10,591 --> 00:40:13,661
And you have to realize that,
try as you may,

772
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:16,987
you can't keep your dad from beating
your mom or save Nate from his demons,

773
00:40:17,112 --> 00:40:19,626
and you can't prevent Max
from bleeding out in your arms.

774
00:40:21,935 --> 00:40:25,923
And now as much as it hurts,
you've to do something really terrible.

775
00:40:26,952 --> 00:40:29,636
But don't worry, Michael.
We're gonna get through this together.

776
00:40:32,655 --> 00:40:34,140
<i>Whether it's a stray hair</i>

777
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:37,310
<i>arranged to detect
someone's opened a drawer</i>

778
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:39,520
<i>or a cabinet
booby-trapped with explosives,</i>

779
00:40:39,796 --> 00:40:42,482
<i>skilled operatives
know how to secure their hiding places.</i>

780
00:40:43,001 --> 00:40:44,665
<i>So if you're searching a pro's home,</i>

781
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:47,028
<i>you can't just toss the place
like a cop with a warrant.</i>

782
00:40:47,404 --> 00:40:49,072
<i>If you don't find any measures</i>

783
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,990
<i>taken to counter intruders,</i>

784
00:40:51,156 --> 00:40:52,617
<i>that tells you something, too.</i>

785
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,911
<i>Usually
that there's nothing worth finding.</i>

786
00:40:55,723 --> 00:40:58,310
No computer,
no clothes hanging in the closet.

787
00:40:58,435 --> 00:41:00,090
Why the hell does he come here?

788
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,653
I think I know.

789
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,212
This.

790
00:41:06,043 --> 00:41:07,173
What is that for?

791
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:09,425
It's an antenna
for a combat-network radio.

792
00:41:09,864 --> 00:41:12,193
The army uses them to encrypt
transmissions in the battlefield.

793
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:14,972
So I'm thinking
that Anson is relaying his signal...

794
00:41:15,193 --> 00:41:17,016
from some government
building's network.

795
00:41:17,624 --> 00:41:20,520
So, he does that, he can reach out
to anywhere in the world.

796
00:41:21,083 --> 00:41:22,772
That's it?
That's all that's here?

797
00:41:23,104 --> 00:41:24,315
A glorified telephone?

798
00:41:24,665 --> 00:41:27,921
At least if we know how he's sending
his messages, we can intercept them.

799
00:41:28,634 --> 00:41:30,992
It's nothing
that's gonna help Michael right now.

800
00:41:31,117 --> 00:41:33,124
<i>Intelligence-agency computers...</i>

801
00:41:33,249 --> 00:41:37,774
<i>make use of the most sophisticated
anti-hacking techniques on the planet,</i>

802
00:41:37,899 --> 00:41:40,104
<i>but any system can be compromised</i>

803
00:41:40,229 --> 00:41:42,750
<i>if it's compromised from the inside.</i>

804
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:47,201
<i>Hackers know you can't put a drive into
a computer port without it registering.</i>

805
00:41:47,326 --> 00:41:50,957
<i>So if you need to sneak software
into a system without leaving a trace,</i>

806
00:41:51,082 --> 00:41:53,410
<i>you need to hide it
in another accessory.</i>

807
00:41:53,535 --> 00:41:56,514
<i>Wiring a thumb drive
to the inner workings of a mouse...</i>

808
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,428
<i>gives you access...</i>

809
00:41:58,553 --> 00:42:01,013
<i>without raising red flags
after you're gone.</i>

810
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:09,736
<i>Sometimes betrayal
is as easy as pushing a button.</i>

811
00:42:15,388 --> 00:42:19,704
<i>But the hard part is being able to live
with yourself after you've done it.</i>
