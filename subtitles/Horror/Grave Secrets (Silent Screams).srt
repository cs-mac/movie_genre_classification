1
00:01:22,137 --> 00:01:23,970
Hello.

2
00:01:25,055 --> 00:01:28,136
- Hello.
- I'm coming!

3
00:01:28,304 --> 00:01:31,220
I'm coming.

4
00:01:32,637 --> 00:01:34,260
Hi.

5
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,719
I'm Jennifer Hills.
We spoke last week.

6
00:01:36,887 --> 00:01:40,345
Oh, yeah, Miss Hills.

7
00:01:40,513 --> 00:01:42,220
Mockingbird Trail, right?

8
00:01:42,388 --> 00:01:43,929
That is right.

9
00:01:45,764 --> 00:01:49,387
I don't suppose you know how
to get out there.

10
00:01:49,554 --> 00:01:52,471
No, I don't.

11
00:01:55,137 --> 00:01:56,721
Well, listen up.

12
00:01:58,472 --> 00:02:00,639
It's a bit tricky.

13
00:02:00,807 --> 00:02:02,098
- Keys.
- Thank you.

14
00:02:03,973 --> 00:02:07,138
These arrows
will get you through town.

15
00:02:07,306 --> 00:02:09,179
Over here

16
00:02:09,347 --> 00:02:11,263
there are more
dirt roads and woods.

17
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,472
Your cabin's a real beaut.

18
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:16,014
But heck, there ain't another
for a good country mile.

19
00:02:16,182 --> 00:02:18,805
I am looking forward
to the peace and quiet.

20
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,597
I'm actually a novelist
and I'm starting my next book here.

21
00:02:21,765 --> 00:02:24,513
If that's what you're aiming for.

22
00:02:24,681 --> 00:02:27,806
You just follow this here map.
Thank you.

23
00:03:26,975 --> 00:03:29,140
Howdy, ma'am.

24
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,100
Excuse me.

25
00:03:42,267 --> 00:03:44,517
I didn't mean to frighten you.

26
00:03:44,685 --> 00:03:47,308
No, that is okay.

27
00:03:47,476 --> 00:03:50,143
You know what?
I am actually lost.

28
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:51,669
I'm looking for Mockingbird Trail.

29
00:03:51,809 --> 00:03:53,977
Mockingbird Trail.
Yeah, you're lost all right.

30
00:03:54,143 --> 00:03:55,642
Really? Yeah yeah, you're lost.

31
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,308
It's about 10 miles back.

32
00:03:57,476 --> 00:04:00,433
It's gonna be
on your left-hand side.

33
00:04:00,602 --> 00:04:02,517
Gonna make a left
after a big red mailbox.

34
00:04:02,685 --> 00:04:04,810
Okay, thanks.
I think I saw that.

35
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:08,643
You staying over in that cabin
on Mockingbird?

36
00:04:08,811 --> 00:04:12,475
- Yeah.
- Fancy!

37
00:04:16,393 --> 00:04:20,143
So you know you're running
a little hot.

38
00:04:20,311 --> 00:04:23,185
Maybe I should check up
under your hood for you.

39
00:04:27,353 --> 00:04:29,770
How's that line working for you?

40
00:04:29,938 --> 00:04:32,852
I don't know.
How's that line working for you?

41
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:42,686
- I got that.
- No, I got it.

42
00:04:42,853 --> 00:04:44,310
No, I got it.

43
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:45,644
Oh shit.

44
00:04:48,312 --> 00:04:50,143
I'm sorry, my bad.

45
00:04:50,311 --> 00:04:53,143
I hit the panic button. Mmhmm.

46
00:04:53,311 --> 00:04:55,020
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

47
00:04:55,188 --> 00:04:57,936
Better check your underwear,
Johnny.

48
00:04:58,104 --> 00:05:00,688
Are you sure you're okay?
Yeah, I said I was fine.

49
00:05:00,853 --> 00:05:03,311
- Okay.
- All right?

50
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:05,936
Keep the change.

51
00:05:16,897 --> 00:05:19,105
Got you that time, Johnny.

52
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,229
Bye-bye.

53
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,610
How's the writing coming?

54
00:08:08,778 --> 00:08:10,653
You kidding me?

55
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:12,609
I should have come out here
on my first book.

56
00:08:12,777 --> 00:08:14,485
You gonna come back
for Hertz's party?

57
00:08:14,653 --> 00:08:17,819
Jen? Did I lose you?

58
00:08:17,986 --> 00:08:19,945
Oh, sorry. Something just-

59
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:23,652
Hey.

60
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,653
You still there?
Barb, hold on a second.

61
00:08:39,154 --> 00:08:41,154
Jen, what's going on?
Let me call you back.

62
00:09:44,073 --> 00:09:46,699
You've got to be kidding me.

63
00:09:50,074 --> 00:09:53,447
Way to go, Jennifer.

64
00:12:44,454 --> 00:12:46,663
No, it won't flush.

65
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,454
Did you check the seal
on the flapper?

66
00:12:48,621 --> 00:12:49,954
I did that already.

67
00:12:50,123 --> 00:12:53,496
- You did?
- Yes.

68
00:12:53,664 --> 00:12:55,205
Look, I'm really in a spot here.

69
00:12:55,373 --> 00:12:57,664
All right, I'll send somebody.
Okay okay.

70
00:12:57,832 --> 00:12:59,248
Thank you. Thank you.

71
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,455
You'll be there?
I'm not going anywhere.

72
00:13:01,623 --> 00:13:02,998
All right, I'll send someone.

73
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,248
So is this gonna
take much longer?

74
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,708
Not much.

75
00:13:31,873 --> 00:13:34,955
What's wrong with it?

76
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:52,749
Yes!

77
00:13:56,498 --> 00:13:58,665
- All fixed.
- Oh, thank you.

78
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:03,583
Sorry. You saved me from having
to bathe in the lake.

79
00:14:03,751 --> 00:14:06,458
Excuse me. L, uh-excuse me.

80
00:14:06,626 --> 00:14:08,208
Wait, I didn't-

81
00:14:12,292 --> 00:14:13,916
Ground rule double.

82
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,958
Double my ass. Look at its head.
I knocked its eye clear out.

83
00:14:17,126 --> 00:14:19,332
Fine, maybe a triple.

84
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,792
But you gotta knock its guts clean out
its mouth if you wanna score a run.

85
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,333
Man, would you turn
that shit off?

86
00:14:24,501 --> 00:14:26,661
You're gonna get us in trouble
with that human society.

87
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:31,500
It's humane, dipshit.
Yeah, whatever.

88
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:34,334
I told you, Andy,
this thing's gonna make me a fortune.

89
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:38,335
So you two retards
gonna go fishing or what?

90
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:41,292
Hey, speaking of retards...

91
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:43,419
- Bull's-eye!
- Andy!

92
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,502
Well, Stanley,
got us all here now.

93
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:53,085
What's the big show?

94
00:14:53,253 --> 00:14:55,168
The big show

95
00:14:55,336 --> 00:14:57,293
is this.

96
00:14:57,461 --> 00:15:01,167
What did you do this time,
film yourself lighting a fart?

97
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,128
I don't know why I bother
with you dipshits.

98
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:08,336
I got Matthew's girlfriend here
in a very private moment.

99
00:15:08,502 --> 00:15:10,209
Girlfriend?

100
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:13,669
Matthew ain't had a girlfriend since
he was sucking on his mama's titties.

101
00:15:13,837 --> 00:15:17,293
He had that city girl all alone
and he didn't even try to nail her.

102
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,294
What city girl?

103
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:21,793
You know what girl.

104
00:15:21,961 --> 00:15:24,002
The one from the gas station
the other day.

105
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,002
The one that had you
on your ass.

106
00:15:27,795 --> 00:15:30,128
She had Matt here fixing
her pipes.

107
00:15:30,295 --> 00:15:33,794
She even gave him a kiss
for servicing her.

108
00:15:33,963 --> 00:15:35,336
Bullshit.

109
00:15:35,504 --> 00:15:39,336
No, she-she-she did, Johnny.
She kissed me.

110
00:15:39,504 --> 00:15:41,838
Hey, Matthew,

111
00:15:42,006 --> 00:15:43,128
don't you lie to me.

112
00:15:43,295 --> 00:15:46,336
Here it comes. Get ready for it.

113
00:15:46,504 --> 00:15:49,671
Oh shit.

114
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:54,545
Hey, that's some good
camerawork, man.

115
00:15:54,713 --> 00:15:57,505
You dirty dog, man.

116
00:15:57,671 --> 00:15:59,128
How the fuck did you get that?

117
00:15:59,295 --> 00:16:01,504
I've been working nights.

118
00:16:01,672 --> 00:16:02,961
She sure is something
to look at.

119
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,378
Yeah yeah.

120
00:16:05,546 --> 00:16:08,502
And she likes me.

121
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,004
Come on, Matthew.

122
00:16:10,171 --> 00:16:12,337
That girl wouldn't even
give Johnny the time of day.

123
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:13,795
What?

124
00:16:13,963 --> 00:16:16,004
Shit.

125
00:16:16,171 --> 00:16:17,838
I can tame that ass
if I want to.

126
00:16:18,006 --> 00:16:20,796
Come on, Johnny.
You saw that girl.

127
00:16:20,964 --> 00:16:22,879
Stuck-up city bitch.

128
00:16:23,047 --> 00:16:24,880
City bitch like that
is ungettable.

129
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:27,714
Bullshit. I'll get it.

130
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:30,715
Let me tell you something:

131
00:16:30,882 --> 00:16:33,505
I had that bitch
creaming her panties.

132
00:16:33,673 --> 00:16:36,463
Yeah, and she had you
shitting in yours.

133
00:16:38,381 --> 00:16:40,880
You don't think I can have that
anytime I want to?

134
00:16:41,048 --> 00:16:42,630
Hmm?

135
00:16:50,632 --> 00:16:52,963
Let me tell you something:

136
00:16:53,131 --> 00:16:54,796
Bitch like that,

137
00:16:54,964 --> 00:16:58,381
she come out here for one reason
and one reason only.

138
00:16:58,549 --> 00:17:02,006
Titties flopping in the window
like that for everyone to see.

139
00:17:02,173 --> 00:17:04,006
Come on, you know.

140
00:17:04,173 --> 00:17:06,048
No no.

141
00:17:06,216 --> 00:17:10,006
She's not like that, Johnny.

142
00:17:10,173 --> 00:17:13,966
They're all like that.

143
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:17,757
Big city cock-teasing whore
is all she is.

144
00:17:17,925 --> 00:17:19,924
Fuckin' A.

145
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:23,715
Shit, Matthew.

146
00:17:23,882 --> 00:17:26,425
You wouldn't know what to do with
a piece of ass like that if you got it.

147
00:17:26,591 --> 00:17:28,674
No shit.

148
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:32,467
But you're lucky

149
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,256
'cause I'm your friend.

150
00:17:36,342 --> 00:17:38,342
I'll show you the way.

151
00:19:38,221 --> 00:19:40,219
Hello.

152
00:21:54,644 --> 00:21:56,934
Nice shot, huh?

153
00:21:57,102 --> 00:21:58,307
Evening.

154
00:21:58,476 --> 00:22:02,142
Get out of here.
Get out of here right now!

155
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,684
Well now.

156
00:22:03,852 --> 00:22:05,372
That ain't very hospitable now, is it?

157
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:07,934
Smile real pretty
for the camera, girl.

158
00:22:10,353 --> 00:22:11,768
Mm-mm-mm.

159
00:22:15,018 --> 00:22:18,352
You all better get out
of here right now.

160
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,019
I called the cops.

161
00:22:20,186 --> 00:22:23,019
Oh, she called the cops.

162
00:22:25,186 --> 00:22:27,686
You called the police
or you will call the police?

163
00:22:27,854 --> 00:22:31,351
I called them already.
They're on their way right now.

164
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,311
What phone did you do that with?

165
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:36,186
Matthew told us you dropped
yours in the drain.

166
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:38,184
Bloop!

167
00:22:40,062 --> 00:22:42,353
Let's pick it up.
Where the hell is that boy?

168
00:22:42,521 --> 00:22:45,978
Matthew, get your bony ass in here!

169
00:22:46,146 --> 00:22:48,729
- Come on.
- Come here, boy.

170
00:22:48,894 --> 00:22:50,518
Get in here, boy. Hey hey hey.

171
00:22:50,686 --> 00:22:52,685
It's all right. Come on now.

172
00:22:52,854 --> 00:22:55,728
Come on, boy. Come here.

173
00:22:59,022 --> 00:23:00,896
Matthew here says

174
00:23:01,062 --> 00:23:02,935
that you didn't pay him
for fixing your sink.

175
00:23:03,103 --> 00:23:04,520
That's not true.

176
00:23:04,688 --> 00:23:07,729
He ran out.

177
00:23:07,896 --> 00:23:09,354
I'll take care of it.

178
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:11,146
He's shy, huh?

179
00:23:11,313 --> 00:23:15,062
Look at that, Matthew.
Look at that. Look at that right there.

180
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,354
Hold up, wait a minute.

181
00:23:23,022 --> 00:23:25,603
Let's not worry
about any of that right now.

182
00:23:27,646 --> 00:23:29,479
What's a pretty little thing like you

183
00:23:29,647 --> 00:23:31,855
doing out here all alone?

184
00:23:32,023 --> 00:23:34,397
I'm writing.

185
00:23:34,566 --> 00:23:36,645
I'm a writer.

186
00:23:36,813 --> 00:23:39,478
She's a writer.

187
00:23:39,647 --> 00:23:41,354
My boyfriend will be here soon.

188
00:23:41,523 --> 00:23:43,647
He's coming up to the cabin.

189
00:23:43,815 --> 00:23:45,980
Is that right?

190
00:23:46,148 --> 00:23:47,689
Oh!

191
00:23:47,856 --> 00:23:49,313
Well, shit.
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.

192
00:23:49,481 --> 00:23:51,812
Boys, now we better
blow on out of here.

193
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,979
We don't wanna interrupt
your date night.

194
00:23:54,147 --> 00:23:57,606
Date night!

195
00:23:57,774 --> 00:23:59,647
Let me tell you something,
sweetheart:

196
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:03,231
There ain't no man
in his right mind

197
00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:05,606
that leaves a pretty little thing

198
00:24:05,774 --> 00:24:08,440
like you out here

199
00:24:08,606 --> 00:24:10,146
all alone.

200
00:24:12,566 --> 00:24:14,356
He's coming.

201
00:24:14,525 --> 00:24:16,149
Night's almost over.

202
00:24:23,357 --> 00:24:25,356
Oh wow.

203
00:24:33,566 --> 00:24:36,190
Come here.

204
00:24:36,358 --> 00:24:38,358
Come here, have a drink with me.
Come on over here.

205
00:24:42,276 --> 00:24:44,940
Come here, pretty little thing.

206
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:47,023
Come here, have a drink with me.

207
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,983
No.

208
00:24:49,151 --> 00:24:51,276
Oh, there you go.

209
00:24:51,445 --> 00:24:53,026
I don't want to.

210
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:56,899
What's the matter?
You too good to have a drink with us?

211
00:24:57,067 --> 00:24:59,190
- See?
- Mm-hmm.

212
00:24:59,358 --> 00:25:01,358
Please, I just don't want to
have a drink.

213
00:25:01,526 --> 00:25:03,735
What is this shit right here?

214
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,108
'Cause that's already
been opened.

215
00:25:06,276 --> 00:25:09,109
Well shit, boys. You were right.

216
00:25:09,277 --> 00:25:11,234
She's too good
to have a drink with us.

217
00:25:11,402 --> 00:25:12,735
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

218
00:25:12,902 --> 00:25:14,774
What are we to you?

219
00:25:14,942 --> 00:25:17,359
A bunch of dirt?

220
00:25:17,527 --> 00:25:19,191
I didn't say that.

221
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:21,191
Fuckin' A,
this bitch is a writer.

222
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:24,693
"No one wants a phone call"

223
00:25:24,861 --> 00:25:26,191
at 2:00 in the morning.

224
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,151
When you're 15,
it's a prank call.

225
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:31,234
When you're 21,
it's a drunk boyfriend call.

226
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,316
But after 25,

227
00:25:33,484 --> 00:25:35,985
it's usually really bad news.

228
00:25:36,151 --> 00:25:39,358
"That's how I found out
my father died."

229
00:25:39,526 --> 00:25:42,317
Whose daddy died?

230
00:25:43,737 --> 00:25:47,192
Can't you all
just please leave me alone?

231
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,695
No!

232
00:25:51,194 --> 00:25:53,152
Just tell me what you want.

233
00:25:55,361 --> 00:25:58,862
What do you want?
I offered you my money.

234
00:25:59,028 --> 00:26:01,360
Mm-hmm.

235
00:26:01,528 --> 00:26:04,027
Whoa!

236
00:26:12,486 --> 00:26:15,153
Here. Here.

237
00:26:16,652 --> 00:26:19,318
Fine. I'll have a drink.

238
00:26:19,486 --> 00:26:21,194
Then you have to leave.

239
00:26:21,361 --> 00:26:24,153
- All right.
- All right.

240
00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:29,696
That ain't shit.

241
00:26:29,862 --> 00:26:32,404
- Come on. Boo!
- Come on now.

242
00:26:32,572 --> 00:26:35,654
Now see, I-

243
00:26:35,822 --> 00:26:38,864
I know you can
do better than that.

244
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,903
I'm sure that when you're
out there in the city

245
00:26:41,071 --> 00:26:44,196
with all your hoity-toity
rich friends,

246
00:26:44,364 --> 00:26:46,071
I bet you can throw 'em back
with the best of 'em.

247
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:47,696
Now can't you?

248
00:26:47,865 --> 00:26:50,154
I took the drink-
I said drink that shit!

249
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:59,864
Come on. There you go.
Chug chug! Guzzle!

250
00:27:00,032 --> 00:27:02,362
Whoo! There it is. There it is.

251
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:05,946
All right, shit.

252
00:27:06,114 --> 00:27:08,361
See, that's not
so bad now, is it?

253
00:27:09,947 --> 00:27:14,030
Listen, I'm sorry
I embarrassed you the other day.

254
00:27:14,197 --> 00:27:17,197
But we're even now, right?

255
00:27:17,363 --> 00:27:20,988
Okay? Just please leave.

256
00:27:21,156 --> 00:27:23,364
Please leave.

257
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:26,654
Well, that's just not
what this is about no more.

258
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:33,448
What is it about?

259
00:27:36,908 --> 00:27:39,488
I wanna see your teeth.

260
00:27:42,532 --> 00:27:44,531
What?

261
00:27:46,367 --> 00:27:48,197
You heard me,

262
00:27:48,365 --> 00:27:50,699
pretty little show horse.

263
00:27:50,867 --> 00:27:52,656
I want

264
00:27:52,824 --> 00:27:55,031
to see

265
00:27:55,198 --> 00:27:56,698
your teeth.

266
00:27:59,198 --> 00:28:00,990
That-

267
00:28:01,158 --> 00:28:03,363
I don't want to-no.

268
00:28:10,742 --> 00:28:13,867
Now you're gonna show
them teeth.

269
00:28:14,035 --> 00:28:16,491
You have beautiful teeth.

270
00:28:16,659 --> 00:28:19,700
There.

271
00:28:24,534 --> 00:28:26,866
There. Let me see 'em.
Real pretty. Real pretty.

272
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:33,742
Let's see more.

273
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:35,699
Put your fingers

274
00:28:35,867 --> 00:28:39,533
on the inside of your mouth
right there.

275
00:28:39,701 --> 00:28:42,867
Now take the other two,
stick 'em on the other side.

276
00:28:43,035 --> 00:28:45,033
There you go.

277
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,533
Now pull.

278
00:28:46,701 --> 00:28:49,991
Okay, please, I'm begging you,
just go.

279
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,742
No.

280
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:58,200
Again.

281
00:29:01,534 --> 00:29:03,826
Come here. There it is.

282
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:06,202
Oh man, yeah! Yeah!

283
00:29:06,368 --> 00:29:09,367
Yeah, that's it.
Come here. All right.

284
00:29:13,411 --> 00:29:15,659
That's my pretty little show horse.
Look at you.

285
00:29:18,454 --> 00:29:21,701
You know why I know you
ain't got no boyfriend?

286
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:24,494
You know why?

287
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:28,327
'Cause all them
city boys are faggots.

288
00:29:28,494 --> 00:29:29,869
Fuckin' A.

289
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:43,077
Since you ain't got
no boyfriend,

290
00:29:43,245 --> 00:29:45,536
well, shit, I figured that...

291
00:29:50,369 --> 00:29:52,702
this would be your man tonight.

292
00:29:55,704 --> 00:29:58,537
No? Come here.

293
00:30:01,871 --> 00:30:03,870
Come on, give him a little kiss.

294
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:07,370
Give him a little kiss, come on.

295
00:30:07,538 --> 00:30:09,536
Give him a little kiss here.

296
00:30:09,704 --> 00:30:11,536
Give him
a little kiss here. Kiss him.

297
00:30:11,704 --> 00:30:13,746
Oh shit, come on now.

298
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:16,793
Come on now. I ain't talking about no
fucking peck like you gave Matthew.

299
00:30:16,871 --> 00:30:19,705
I want you to give him
a little kiss now. Go on, kiss him.

300
00:30:19,872 --> 00:30:22,579
Get up on your knees.

301
00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:28,203
If I don't like your enthusiasm,

302
00:30:28,371 --> 00:30:31,037
I may come bad.

303
00:30:36,538 --> 00:30:38,494
Open up. Open up.

304
00:30:38,662 --> 00:30:40,370
There it is. There it is.
There it is.

305
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:42,245
All right, all right.

306
00:30:42,413 --> 00:30:45,705
Breathe through your nose.
Come on, you know this.

307
00:30:45,873 --> 00:30:47,313
Just like it's your
first time again.

308
00:30:47,374 --> 00:30:50,165
Breathe through your nose.
Breathe through your nose.

309
00:30:50,332 --> 00:30:51,663
All right, all right.

310
00:30:51,831 --> 00:30:54,371
Shit!

311
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,665
Come on now.
Let's let Matthew have the girl.

312
00:30:59,831 --> 00:31:02,373
I d-don't want to.

313
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:03,830
I don't.

314
00:31:03,998 --> 00:31:07,205
What? What the fuck did you say?

315
00:31:07,373 --> 00:31:10,747
What the hell you mean
you d-d-don't want to?

316
00:31:10,914 --> 00:31:13,414
I don't want to, Johnny.

317
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,040
- He d-d-don't want to.
- Come on.

318
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,706
Listen to me.

319
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:19,706
Fuck that, man.

320
00:31:19,873 --> 00:31:21,539
I ain't fucking waiting.

321
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:22,913
Aw shit!

322
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,372
She-she likes me.

323
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,540
She likes you, Matthew?

324
00:31:26,707 --> 00:31:28,372
Go ahead.

325
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:31,997
- Please.
- Suck it, bitch.

326
00:31:32,165 --> 00:31:34,372
Come on now.
We're doing this for you.

327
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,041
Go prove it to me.

328
00:31:40,207 --> 00:31:42,708
- Oh God.
- Oh shit!

329
00:31:44,874 --> 00:31:47,457
Come on, boys!

330
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:21,875
Whoa there.

331
00:32:22,044 --> 00:32:24,043
Whoa there. Easy, darling.

332
00:32:27,002 --> 00:32:30,001
Help me! Help me, please.
Okay, I got you.

333
00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:32,043
I was assaulted.

334
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,834
He came into my cabin
and he had a gun.

335
00:32:34,002 --> 00:32:36,084
Ma'am, it's okay.
You need to calm down now, please.

336
00:32:36,252 --> 00:32:37,711
It was in my mouth.

337
00:32:37,879 --> 00:32:39,461
He put a gun in my mouth.
You don't understand.

338
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:41,002
I know this one.

339
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:43,168
She rented the place
down on Mockingbird Trail.

340
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:46,542
I was assaulted. Hey, it's okay.

341
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:48,833
I'm a sheriff.

342
00:32:49,001 --> 00:32:50,751
You're safe.

343
00:32:50,918 --> 00:32:53,710
Now tell me what happened.

344
00:32:53,878 --> 00:32:55,835
These four men-

345
00:32:56,003 --> 00:32:58,376
there were four men
and they broke into my cabin.

346
00:32:58,544 --> 00:33:00,835
And they had a gun
and they assaulted me.

347
00:33:01,001 --> 00:33:03,710
Did you get a nice look at them?
Can you ID 'em?

348
00:33:03,878 --> 00:33:06,710
Yes, I'd seen them.

349
00:33:06,878 --> 00:33:08,878
Around here?
Yes, they work at the service station

350
00:33:09,045 --> 00:33:11,044
right outside of town.
John Miller, no doubt.

351
00:33:11,211 --> 00:33:13,877
Yes, they called him Johnny.
And there was this heavyset guy.

352
00:33:14,045 --> 00:33:16,251
Sounds like them boys have
been up to no good again.

353
00:33:16,418 --> 00:33:18,752
All right, Earl,
you head on back.

354
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:21,877
Me and Miss-
Hills. Jennifer Hills.

355
00:33:22,045 --> 00:33:23,628
Me and Miss Hills are gonna head
on over to the cabin

356
00:33:23,796 --> 00:33:26,545
and straighten things out.

357
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:57,045
Miller!

358
00:33:57,213 --> 00:33:59,088
Miller, this is the sheriff.

359
00:33:59,256 --> 00:34:02,419
You and your boys are still here,
you come on out right now.

360
00:34:18,548 --> 00:34:22,255
Miller, if you're up there,
you'll be leaving by the window.

361
00:34:25,257 --> 00:34:28,047
Ma'am, stay here.

362
00:35:02,381 --> 00:35:04,423
You here alone?

363
00:35:04,591 --> 00:35:06,839
Yes.

364
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,883
With all this?

365
00:35:16,049 --> 00:35:18,215
I didn't plan on drinking it all
right away.

366
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:20,841
I was gonna be here
for a couple months.

367
00:35:21,009 --> 00:35:23,008
You drink some this evening?

368
00:35:23,176 --> 00:35:24,632
Yes.

369
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:47,382
One of them went upstairs
and he went through everything.

370
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,549
They do this too?

371
00:36:00,717 --> 00:36:03,301
Please, I really don't care
about any of that.

372
00:36:04,926 --> 00:36:06,759
How long you been here?

373
00:36:06,926 --> 00:36:09,009
Just a couple days.

374
00:36:10,718 --> 00:36:13,218
Anything strange happen
before this?

375
00:36:13,386 --> 00:36:17,218
You have a run-in
with any of these guys?

376
00:36:17,386 --> 00:36:19,301
No, not really.

377
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:22,301
Just stopped for gas
and directions.

378
00:36:27,011 --> 00:36:29,759
Ma'am, is this your
marijuana cigarette?

379
00:36:29,926 --> 00:36:33,384
Um, no.

380
00:36:33,552 --> 00:36:36,216
One of the boys
must have left it.

381
00:36:37,969 --> 00:36:41,052
You mean to tell me one
of them guys is wearing lipstick?

382
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,719
This ain't the big city.

383
00:36:45,887 --> 00:36:48,260
Please, I may have smoked a joint,

384
00:36:48,428 --> 00:36:50,552
but that doesn't mean
that I made any of this up.

385
00:36:52,095 --> 00:36:54,302
This is Storch.
I'm at Mockingbird cabin.

386
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:57,594
Gonna need some backup. Backup?

387
00:36:57,763 --> 00:37:00,469
What could you possibly
need backup for? I'm the victim.

388
00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:03,053
Ma'am, you've been drinking,

389
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,968
smoking marijuana cigarettes.

390
00:37:05,136 --> 00:37:08,720
You got enough booze in here to put
the whole town three sheets to the wind.

391
00:37:08,887 --> 00:37:11,969
You're running around in your sleeping
garments at the crack of dawn.

392
00:37:12,137 --> 00:37:13,471
You gotta see this
from my point of view.

393
00:37:13,638 --> 00:37:17,012
What? They came in here
and they assaulted me.

394
00:37:17,181 --> 00:37:18,553
You have to believe me.

395
00:37:18,721 --> 00:37:20,969
Ma'am, I'm just trying
to get to the bottom of this.

396
00:37:21,137 --> 00:37:22,469
You're making serious accusations

397
00:37:22,636 --> 00:37:25,094
about boys I've known
since they was kids.

398
00:37:25,262 --> 00:37:28,720
And you haven't been
altogether truthful now, have you?

399
00:37:31,763 --> 00:37:34,386
Now please,
step up against the wall.

400
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:48,889
Shoulder width apart.

401
00:38:00,681 --> 00:38:03,222
Ma'am, please.

402
00:38:03,388 --> 00:38:05,723
Look right ahead.

403
00:38:25,598 --> 00:38:28,056
Now...

404
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:31,515
I want the whole story.

405
00:38:31,682 --> 00:38:33,557
You tell me the whole thing.

406
00:38:36,391 --> 00:38:38,557
You start by telling me
what those boys did.

407
00:38:38,724 --> 00:38:41,223
Tell the sheriff the truth,
show horse.

408
00:38:45,558 --> 00:38:49,058
Better yet,
why don't you show him?

409
00:38:54,015 --> 00:38:56,432
Show him how that pretty little mouth
of yours couldn't get enough

410
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,223
as far as I recall.
Is that right?

411
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,224
They do this?

412
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:24,225
Nice little tits.

413
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:37,809
I asked you a question.

414
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,892
Please.

415
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:48,558
You show the sheriff
your teeth there, show horse.

416
00:39:48,727 --> 00:39:50,184
Come on.

417
00:39:51,894 --> 00:39:54,392
- Come on, move.
- Get!

418
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,892
Move!

419
00:40:04,642 --> 00:40:06,642
Now whinny.

420
00:40:08,018 --> 00:40:10,061
I said whinny!

421
00:40:10,228 --> 00:40:12,895
- Whinny!
- Oh, man!

422
00:40:13,062 --> 00:40:16,226
Whinny! Whinny! Whinny!

423
00:40:18,394 --> 00:40:21,186
Huh. Huh.

424
00:40:24,853 --> 00:40:28,394
Now get on your knees.
Keep going.

425
00:40:28,562 --> 00:40:30,562
Keep whinnying, show horse.

426
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:32,518
Here we go.

427
00:40:32,686 --> 00:40:34,685
Get on your knees.

428
00:40:37,228 --> 00:40:39,102
Keep whinnying!

429
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:41,393
Oh-ho-ho!

430
00:40:45,688 --> 00:40:48,728
You oughta tame
that little mare of yours.

431
00:40:51,395 --> 00:40:52,936
Come on.
On your feet, show horse.

432
00:40:53,104 --> 00:40:55,269
On your feet or you're not
gonna get your sugar cube.

433
00:40:55,437 --> 00:40:57,061
Matthew,
get your clothes off, boy.

434
00:40:57,228 --> 00:40:58,394
We're gonna get
your cherry popped.

435
00:40:58,563 --> 00:41:00,061
Huh-uh.

436
00:41:00,228 --> 00:41:02,187
Matthew, I ain't
asking you a question.

437
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:06,019
Stop that rubber band shit, homo.

438
00:41:06,187 --> 00:41:09,854
You wanna talk the talk,
you better walk the walk.

439
00:41:10,022 --> 00:41:11,562
I'm walking.

440
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:13,439
- Stop, stop.
- Virgin.

441
00:41:13,605 --> 00:41:14,980
Please stop.

442
00:41:20,231 --> 00:41:23,520
You get your clothes off
or I'm gonna slice her

443
00:41:23,688 --> 00:41:26,687
from the chin

444
00:41:26,855 --> 00:41:29,188
- to cunt.
- Oh!

445
00:41:29,355 --> 00:41:32,021
Oh yeah!

446
00:41:36,896 --> 00:41:38,771
There's Matthew. Now he gets it.

447
00:41:38,938 --> 00:41:40,855
Pants off, boy.

448
00:41:41,023 --> 00:41:44,190
Oh, what the hell, Matthew?
He ain't even hard yet.

449
00:41:47,065 --> 00:41:49,564
Well, it's not totally his fault.

450
00:41:49,732 --> 00:41:52,898
She ain't done much to get
his motor running now, has she?

451
00:41:53,066 --> 00:41:58,521
Dance.

452
00:41:58,689 --> 00:41:59,773
Come on.

453
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,731
- Come on, baby.
- Move it!

454
00:42:02,899 --> 00:42:06,607
Prance for us.
Prance, show horse!

455
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:10,190
Prance for us now. Come on,
like you do when you wanna get laid.

456
00:42:10,355 --> 00:42:12,355
Whoo! Come on!

457
00:42:12,524 --> 00:42:14,858
I want you to watch this,
Matthew.

458
00:42:15,024 --> 00:42:16,939
You dance like that
in them city clubs?

459
00:42:17,107 --> 00:42:20,357
- Ho!
- Come on now!

460
00:42:20,525 --> 00:42:22,191
You watching this, boy?

461
00:42:24,566 --> 00:42:26,231
What?

462
00:42:26,399 --> 00:42:29,397
Okay, I'll-I'll-I'll-
I'll do it.

463
00:42:29,565 --> 00:42:31,774
Okay? Okay.

464
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:34,231
- Come here.
- Oh, yeah!

465
00:42:34,399 --> 00:42:37,981
Okay, here we go.
Get up, get up.

466
00:42:38,149 --> 00:42:41,231
This is for you, Matthew.
This is for you, boy.

467
00:42:41,399 --> 00:42:43,149
Oh yeah! Oh shit!

468
00:42:43,316 --> 00:42:45,191
Get her up here. Shut her up.

469
00:42:48,401 --> 00:42:50,231
No! No! No!

470
00:42:50,399 --> 00:42:52,733
Hold her legs!

471
00:42:52,901 --> 00:42:54,067
Oh my God.

472
00:42:54,234 --> 00:42:56,566
I'll bash your fucking
face in, bitch.

473
00:42:56,734 --> 00:42:59,440
- Shut up.
- No no no!

474
00:42:59,608 --> 00:43:01,900
That's for you.
Get your drawers off, Matthew.

475
00:43:02,068 --> 00:43:04,149
- God damn it.
- Okay.

476
00:43:06,026 --> 00:43:08,648
Here. Here. Get her panties off.

477
00:43:08,817 --> 00:43:10,901
- I'll rip 'em off.
- No!

478
00:43:15,275 --> 00:43:17,400
Yeah, get her.

479
00:43:17,568 --> 00:43:19,775
Damn it, hold her still.
Come on, retard.

480
00:43:19,942 --> 00:43:22,109
- No! No!
- Hold her down!

481
00:43:22,277 --> 00:43:24,734
Stick your pee-pee in her. Okay!

482
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:27,027
Come on, Matt, get in here.
Get in there.

483
00:43:31,611 --> 00:43:33,026
Get in there!

484
00:43:33,192 --> 00:43:35,567
- Yeah, Matthew!
- Oh no!

485
00:43:35,735 --> 00:43:38,902
Look at him go.
There's a gang-banger.

486
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:42,630
Feels good, don't it, Matthew,
pumping away on her? Get her legs.

487
00:43:42,736 --> 00:43:45,735
Yeah, come on, son.
Come on, boy!

488
00:43:45,903 --> 00:43:48,402
Deep. Get in deep. Get in deep.

489
00:43:48,568 --> 00:43:51,527
Deep deep deep deep!

490
00:43:51,693 --> 00:43:53,902
- Deep!
- Yeah, Matthew.

491
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:56,943
Get over here.

492
00:43:57,111 --> 00:44:00,027
Hey, put that thing down
and get over here.

493
00:44:00,195 --> 00:44:03,901
Keep her quiet. Fucking gag her.
Shut your fucking mouth!

494
00:44:04,069 --> 00:44:05,443
Gag her!

495
00:44:05,611 --> 00:44:07,944
Shut her up!

496
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:11,320
It feels good, don't it, Matthew?
Yeah yeah!

497
00:44:13,945 --> 00:44:17,111
Keep her quiet now!

498
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,318
Hello, angel.

499
00:44:19,486 --> 00:44:21,235
Daddy's on a call.

500
00:44:21,403 --> 00:44:23,278
Daddy, it's Sunday.

501
00:44:23,446 --> 00:44:25,196
You always make breakfast
before church.

502
00:44:25,361 --> 00:44:27,236
I know, I know, sweetheart.

503
00:44:27,404 --> 00:44:30,028
Daddy's real busy.
You tell mom I'm running late.

504
00:44:30,196 --> 00:44:32,070
Okay. Bye, Daddy.

505
00:44:36,446 --> 00:44:38,571
Yeah, Matthew! Yeah, Matthew!

506
00:44:38,739 --> 00:44:41,278
He fill her up yet?

507
00:44:43,197 --> 00:44:45,570
Damn it. Oh shit!

508
00:44:46,739 --> 00:44:49,362
You're the shit, Matthew.

509
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:51,820
You're getting your ass beat
by a woman.

510
00:44:53,864 --> 00:44:56,737
Matthew,
you better control that bitch.

511
00:44:56,905 --> 00:44:58,738
Hold her down. Yeah.

512
00:45:28,573 --> 00:45:30,573
Yeah, boy. Over there.

513
00:45:30,741 --> 00:45:32,073
Over there.

514
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:44,198
You clean that shit up.

515
00:45:44,365 --> 00:45:45,697
Make her do it.

516
00:45:45,865 --> 00:45:48,238
You heard him. Clean it up.

517
00:45:48,406 --> 00:45:51,781
Hey, Matthew, get back here.
You all right, boy?

518
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:53,907
Oh man, this is so like my fantasy.

519
00:45:56,698 --> 00:45:58,323
You can thank me later.

520
00:45:58,491 --> 00:46:01,574
You calm down, boy.

521
00:46:01,742 --> 00:46:03,739
You did all right, Matthew.

522
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,868
No no.

523
00:47:13,036 --> 00:47:14,910
Please.

524
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:20,909
No.

525
00:47:23,786 --> 00:47:25,910
No no.

526
00:47:32,369 --> 00:47:35,617
You ever get mace in your eyes, bitch?
That shit hurts.

527
00:47:35,785 --> 00:47:38,577
- Now take a look, honey.
- No.

528
00:47:38,744 --> 00:47:41,577
I'll bet you're thirsty, huh?

529
00:47:41,745 --> 00:47:44,118
Why don't you have a drink?

530
00:47:50,994 --> 00:47:53,620
Do it again!
You like that? Let's have another one.

531
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:56,578
Hold her down.
Hold her head down.

532
00:48:02,413 --> 00:48:05,744
All right, boys,

533
00:48:05,913 --> 00:48:07,513
that filly's got a few more races
to run.

534
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:14,454
You like that, girl?

535
00:48:14,622 --> 00:48:18,080
You like that sweet water, huh? Yeah.

536
00:48:19,288 --> 00:48:21,911
You got some fight
left in you, Miss Hills.

537
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:24,079
I like things rough.

538
00:48:24,246 --> 00:48:27,786
Please. Please.

539
00:48:29,914 --> 00:48:32,246
- Yeah.
- I'm sore.

540
00:48:32,412 --> 00:48:34,245
Please.

541
00:48:35,455 --> 00:48:37,453
I'm sore.

542
00:48:41,622 --> 00:48:42,746
Don't worry now, sweetheart.

543
00:48:45,915 --> 00:48:47,746
I'm an ass man.

544
00:49:37,124 --> 00:49:40,665
No teeth, show horse.

545
00:49:40,833 --> 00:49:42,832
No teeth.

546
00:49:46,875 --> 00:49:49,084
Whoo!

547
00:50:02,751 --> 00:50:05,208
God damn, Stanley.

548
00:50:05,375 --> 00:50:07,874
30 seconds.
Must be a new record for you, man.

549
00:50:08,042 --> 00:50:09,415
That bitch was too tight.

550
00:50:09,583 --> 00:50:12,792
Don't you know you're supposed
to wait for the lady?

551
00:50:12,959 --> 00:50:15,749
Shit, man, like she cares.

552
00:50:15,917 --> 00:50:17,665
She's laying there
like a dead fish.

553
00:50:17,833 --> 00:50:20,633
Besides, she's bleeding as all hell.
Wonder if the bitch got messed up.

554
00:50:20,793 --> 00:50:23,417
Yeah, right. We all thought
Matthew was gonna

555
00:50:23,585 --> 00:50:25,753
be the pussy today, huh?

556
00:50:25,921 --> 00:50:28,585
Don't know what
you're bragging about, Andy.

557
00:50:28,753 --> 00:50:31,417
Clocked you
just over two minutes.

558
00:50:31,586 --> 00:50:33,167
It's been a while, man.

559
00:50:33,335 --> 00:50:34,876
I'm out of practice.

560
00:50:35,044 --> 00:50:38,169
It's been, I don't know,
maybe 10 years.

561
00:50:39,377 --> 00:50:40,417
Where you going?

562
00:50:40,585 --> 00:50:43,042
God damn,
she's got some fight in her.

563
00:52:13,216 --> 00:52:14,714
Come on, let's chase.

564
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,087
Where does she think she's going?

565
00:52:34,591 --> 00:52:38,589
Well, it was fun
while it lasted, Miss Hills.

566
00:52:51,466 --> 00:52:53,506
Shit!

567
00:52:57,633 --> 00:53:00,423
Where is she?

568
00:53:02,258 --> 00:53:05,175
Hell, she's gotta
come up for air sometime.

569
00:53:05,343 --> 00:53:07,548
Shit.

570
00:53:18,257 --> 00:53:22,091
Gators must have
got her by now. Right, Sheriff?

571
00:53:27,467 --> 00:53:30,008
Listen up.

572
00:53:30,174 --> 00:53:33,092
Creek ends about six miles
downstream in Watson.

573
00:53:33,257 --> 00:53:36,093
Between here and there,
we're gonna find her.

574
00:53:36,258 --> 00:53:38,841
We split up. We check the banks,

575
00:53:39,009 --> 00:53:40,300
in the timber, under rocks.

576
00:53:40,468 --> 00:53:43,008
Hell, you see a hole big enough
for her, I want you in there.

577
00:53:43,175 --> 00:53:46,424
And do not stop till y'all
find me a dead city whore.

578
00:54:03,761 --> 00:54:04,925
Nothing.

579
00:54:08,884 --> 00:54:10,926
Not a goddamn thing.

580
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:27,259
Now what?

581
00:54:27,427 --> 00:54:30,425
Her body will show up one way
or another.

582
00:54:32,928 --> 00:54:35,134
Every day we're
gonna check the ravine,

583
00:54:35,301 --> 00:54:38,551
from the bridge
straight down through here and back.

584
00:54:38,719 --> 00:54:40,470
Two shifts a day
till we find something.

585
00:54:40,638 --> 00:54:42,219
For how long?

586
00:54:44,262 --> 00:54:47,386
Till I goddamn fucking say. Clear?

587
00:54:50,595 --> 00:54:53,094
Andy, you get on back to the cabin.
Clean her shit up.

588
00:54:53,261 --> 00:54:56,052
Burn it, all of it. You hear me?

589
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:58,762
Yes sir.

590
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:00,635
You get her wheels
down the shop.

591
00:55:00,803 --> 00:55:02,928
Strip it down to its
last goddamn nut.

592
00:55:03,096 --> 00:55:04,928
That's gonna take two weeks.

593
00:55:09,638 --> 00:55:11,844
All right, Sheriff, yeah.

594
00:55:12,012 --> 00:55:14,054
I'll have Andy torch it out

595
00:55:14,222 --> 00:55:16,219
and I'll rub the numbers out.

596
00:55:24,137 --> 00:55:25,844
Asshole!

597
00:55:26,012 --> 00:55:29,096
The fuck you saving that for,
you moron?

598
00:55:29,263 --> 00:55:31,595
It's fucking evidence!

599
00:55:33,764 --> 00:55:36,555
I shit you not!

600
00:55:52,598 --> 00:55:55,096
I need you all on point
for this.

601
00:55:55,263 --> 00:55:57,971
And I mean goddamn
fucking point.

602
00:55:58,139 --> 00:56:00,888
We clear?

603
00:56:03,223 --> 00:56:04,931
Now pony up.

604
00:56:05,097 --> 00:56:07,429
We got shit to do.

605
00:56:07,598 --> 00:56:10,263
Burn that effing tape.

606
00:56:15,098 --> 00:56:17,097
Well, that's all of it,

607
00:56:17,265 --> 00:56:19,889
right down
to her little titty sling.

608
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:32,721
Man, this fire's
making me hungry.

609
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,723
Well, there's a headline.

610
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:37,225
We gotta finish this shit.

611
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:39,766
We gotta get that car
in the garage.

612
00:56:39,934 --> 00:56:42,932
Then you can stuff your face
till you puke.

613
00:56:46,266 --> 00:56:48,138
Where the hell's Matthew at?

614
00:56:48,306 --> 00:56:51,431
He ain't one to stay behind.

615
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:55,433
He was looking around the water like
some crazed dog after a bone, man.

616
00:56:55,601 --> 00:56:58,307
You keep an eye on him.

617
00:56:58,475 --> 00:57:00,556
We gotta make sure
he keeps it together, you hear me?

618
00:57:02,141 --> 00:57:04,140
Just at least until
this shit's over.

619
00:57:42,936 --> 00:57:44,643
Gone all day, I got nervous.

620
00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:47,559
Anything worth telling?
Just the usual.

621
00:57:47,727 --> 00:57:50,975
The mess they got on Highway 1
took forever.

622
00:57:51,143 --> 00:57:52,475
- Daddy.
- How's my angel?

623
00:57:52,643 --> 00:57:53,976
Daddy.

624
00:57:54,142 --> 00:57:55,682
Got anything on the stove?

625
00:57:55,851 --> 00:57:58,892
Sure, I'll reheat it.
You'll be proud.

626
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:01,060
Proud of what?

627
00:58:04,935 --> 00:58:07,393
I was accepted
to the honors program, Daddy.

628
00:58:08,978 --> 00:58:10,811
Can you believe it?
Of course I can.

629
00:58:10,976 --> 00:58:13,352
I expect nothing less
from my angel.

630
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,269
Mommy and I are proud of you.

631
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:21,018
I'm gonna shower up.

632
00:58:46,021 --> 00:58:49,021
Every time I come in here
this place gets worse.

633
00:58:49,189 --> 00:58:51,268
Yeah, and business keeps getting

634
00:58:51,436 --> 00:58:53,561
better and better.

635
00:59:03,023 --> 00:59:05,021
Mockingbird Trail.

636
00:59:05,189 --> 00:59:06,437
Miss Hills.

637
00:59:06,605 --> 00:59:08,646
She left?

638
00:59:08,814 --> 00:59:10,895
She did indeed.

639
00:59:11,063 --> 00:59:13,730
I couldn't make head
nor tail of it.

640
00:59:13,896 --> 00:59:16,688
I found empty cases of booze,

641
00:59:16,854 --> 00:59:18,813
marijuana cigarettes.

642
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:20,063
Crazy wild one.

643
00:59:20,231 --> 00:59:22,271
She'd have made a preacher cuss.

644
00:59:22,439 --> 00:59:25,270
- My lucky day.
- Why's that?

645
00:59:25,438 --> 00:59:27,770
No refund policy.

646
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:30,438
Christmas come early.

647
00:59:30,606 --> 00:59:32,437
Enjoy it.

648
00:59:33,607 --> 00:59:36,438
Speaking of early,
next month's quail season.

649
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:38,107
I don't know about you,

650
00:59:38,274 --> 00:59:41,314
but I'm getting tired
of shooting squirrels.

651
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:44,562
Me too.

652
01:00:17,148 --> 01:00:19,565
Thank you.
You have a pretty smile.

653
01:00:19,733 --> 01:00:22,774
Did you just come here
to see me?

654
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:24,774
Happy hour, boys.

655
01:00:24,942 --> 01:00:28,272
Fuckin' A. Here's to your mama.

656
01:00:33,982 --> 01:00:36,191
I just want all this bullshit
to be over.

657
01:01:13,319 --> 01:01:15,275
No!

658
01:01:49,151 --> 01:01:50,943
He's the big black guy
in the red drawstring.

659
01:01:51,111 --> 01:01:52,902
You're talking about the garbage man.

660
01:01:53,070 --> 01:01:54,610
Well, give the man a turkey.

661
01:01:58,361 --> 01:02:01,276
- Hello.
- Yeah.

662
01:02:01,445 --> 01:02:04,734
It's Earl.

663
01:02:04,902 --> 01:02:06,443
- Earl.
- Yeah.

664
01:02:06,611 --> 01:02:09,444
This woman leaves a message
on the machine.

665
01:02:09,611 --> 01:02:10,902
Barbara something or other.

666
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:12,610
Yeah, so?

667
01:02:12,779 --> 01:02:15,402
She was asking
about that Miss Hills.

668
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:18,152
Says no one's seen her
in over a month.

669
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:21,194
Ain't that about the time
she split?

670
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:23,487
Yeah.

671
01:02:23,655 --> 01:02:25,610
Yeah, and you know the story.

672
01:02:25,778 --> 01:02:28,488
I don't know. I wasn't there.

673
01:02:28,654 --> 01:02:31,570
I think you should
call her back.

674
01:02:31,736 --> 01:02:34,154
I mean, heck, Sheriff,

675
01:02:34,322 --> 01:02:36,445
you may have been
the last one to see her.

676
01:02:40,279 --> 01:02:41,904
Sheriff?

677
01:02:42,072 --> 01:02:44,612
Okay, I'll call her.

678
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:46,946
Good. You want the number?

679
01:02:47,112 --> 01:02:50,570
No, it's late.

680
01:02:50,738 --> 01:02:53,236
I'll get it from you in the AM.

681
01:02:56,114 --> 01:02:57,474
We're still on
for tomorrow, right?

682
01:02:57,531 --> 01:02:59,904
Yeah, of course.

683
01:03:01,988 --> 01:03:05,280
Everything all right?

684
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,780
Yeah, just fine.

685
01:03:14,615 --> 01:03:17,114
It's gone!

686
01:03:17,281 --> 01:03:18,949
Look at that.

687
01:03:19,117 --> 01:03:20,947
Looks like someone
spooked the cattle.

688
01:03:24,991 --> 01:03:27,196
It's gone!

689
01:03:27,364 --> 01:03:28,864
It's fucking gone!

690
01:03:29,032 --> 01:03:31,156
Jesus, Stanley,
calm the fuck down.

691
01:03:31,324 --> 01:03:32,697
What's got your nuts in a sling?

692
01:03:32,865 --> 01:03:35,656
My camera, it's gone.
Someone stole it.

693
01:03:35,824 --> 01:03:38,365
Maybe you accidentally ate it.

694
01:03:38,533 --> 01:03:41,031
Fuck off, man, this is serious!

695
01:03:44,449 --> 01:03:45,905
It had the tape in it.

696
01:03:46,074 --> 01:03:48,073
What are you talking about?

697
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:50,156
The tape.

698
01:03:50,324 --> 01:03:52,448
The fucking tape.

699
01:03:53,783 --> 01:03:56,448
The tape Storch smashed to bits?
That tape?

700
01:03:56,616 --> 01:03:58,614
Oh, man,
Storch didn't smash shit.

701
01:03:58,782 --> 01:04:00,406
I replaced it with a new one.

702
01:04:00,574 --> 01:04:04,407
The Sheriff stomped
on the one that had nothing on it.

703
01:04:08,658 --> 01:04:11,783
You kept that tape, huh?

704
01:04:11,951 --> 01:04:13,533
You kept that tape,
you stupid piece of shit?

705
01:04:13,699 --> 01:04:16,115
Come here. You kept that tape?

706
01:04:16,282 --> 01:04:18,657
You kept that fucking tape?
Please, Andy!

707
01:04:18,825 --> 01:04:21,574
Hey hey hey!
What's wrong with you?

708
01:04:21,742 --> 01:04:24,282
How could you lose that fucking tape?
Come on, man.

709
01:04:24,450 --> 01:04:25,991
Come on.

710
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:28,741
Gotta stick together
on this one.

711
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:31,782
You're too dumb to know
how dumb you are.

712
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:33,782
You know that?

713
01:05:16,453 --> 01:05:17,952
Uh-huh.

714
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:25,078
Is that right?

715
01:05:34,786 --> 01:05:37,370
I better not find you,
you little fucker.

716
01:06:06,413 --> 01:06:09,744
All right. All right, let's go.

717
01:06:09,912 --> 01:06:12,621
Come on out, fucker.

718
01:06:12,787 --> 01:06:15,078
Come on!

719
01:06:15,246 --> 01:06:16,912
You think this shit's funny?

720
01:06:22,664 --> 01:06:25,035
Andy?

721
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:28,662
Stanley?

722
01:06:32,955 --> 01:06:35,081
Fucking pussies.

723
01:06:36,455 --> 01:06:39,621
All right. All right.

724
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:11,956
That's it, God damn it.

725
01:07:12,124 --> 01:07:15,123
Yeah, come on! Come on! Come on!

726
01:07:15,290 --> 01:07:18,123
Yeah! Come on, fucker!

727
01:07:18,290 --> 01:07:21,997
Come on out, fucker.

728
01:07:23,624 --> 01:07:26,456
Oh shit.

729
01:07:29,166 --> 01:07:31,624
Come on. Come on.

730
01:07:31,791 --> 01:07:33,792
Come on. Come on.

731
01:07:49,335 --> 01:07:51,541
Son of a bitch.

732
01:07:57,792 --> 01:07:59,542
Sweetheart.

733
01:08:02,792 --> 01:08:04,749
They're beautiful.

734
01:08:05,959 --> 01:08:07,625
I've been so busy.

735
01:08:07,791 --> 01:08:10,417
No need to explain.

736
01:08:10,585 --> 01:08:13,458
You hadn't taken a single day off.
You're only human.

737
01:08:13,626 --> 01:08:14,959
I guess.

738
01:08:15,127 --> 01:08:17,458
Maybe you can help me with something
while I put these in water.

739
01:08:17,626 --> 01:08:18,958
Help with what?

740
01:08:19,126 --> 01:08:22,000
I got this tape delivered,
but it don't fit our machine.

741
01:08:22,168 --> 01:08:23,959
What tape?

742
01:08:24,127 --> 01:08:26,793
It came this morning.
I think it's Chastity's recital.

743
01:08:33,084 --> 01:08:34,834
Chastity see this?

744
01:08:35,001 --> 01:08:37,793
No. Like I said,
we couldn't get it to play.

745
01:08:37,961 --> 01:08:40,543
Where is she?

746
01:08:40,710 --> 01:08:42,709
She's sleeping. Why?

747
01:08:45,628 --> 01:08:47,628
I'm gonna be back.

748
01:08:59,753 --> 01:09:01,626
Where the hell you been?

749
01:09:01,794 --> 01:09:05,126
Beauty queen over here
doing his hair for two hours.

750
01:09:05,293 --> 01:09:08,545
What's this all about, man?

751
01:09:08,712 --> 01:09:10,503
Where'd you get that?
Where'd I get that?

752
01:09:10,669 --> 01:09:12,837
Right there.
That's where I got that.

753
01:09:13,003 --> 01:09:15,170
Somebody left me a present
last night on my doorstep.

754
01:09:15,336 --> 01:09:18,419
Jesus, man, Matthew! Come on!

755
01:09:18,587 --> 01:09:20,461
- You boys seen him?
- No, man.

756
01:09:20,628 --> 01:09:23,544
No one knows where he's at.

757
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:28,837
- Oh shit!
- This shit ain't good.

758
01:09:36,088 --> 01:09:37,920
What?

759
01:09:39,672 --> 01:09:40,872
I didn't do anything, Sheriff.

760
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,962
You wanna tell me why
this was dropped off to my house?

761
01:09:45,170 --> 01:09:47,753
To my wife!

762
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:55,837
What's on the tape?
Is this some kind of fucked up joke?

763
01:09:56,003 --> 01:09:58,004
I smashed the damn thing myself!

764
01:09:58,172 --> 01:10:01,796
No, Sheriff.
Genius there reloaded the camera.

765
01:10:01,964 --> 01:10:04,131
The one you smashed
ain't got nothing on it.

766
01:10:04,298 --> 01:10:06,587
You knew about this?

767
01:10:06,756 --> 01:10:09,838
No, Sheriff,
I just found out about it myself.

768
01:10:10,005 --> 01:10:13,172
Eat that tape, fat boy!

769
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:16,381
Fucking tape!

770
01:10:16,549 --> 01:10:18,296
You think it's funny?

771
01:10:20,714 --> 01:10:23,630
You screwed up, fat boy.

772
01:10:23,798 --> 01:10:26,088
Sheriff.
It was Matthew, Sheriff.

773
01:10:26,256 --> 01:10:28,548
I mean, dipshit there,
he kept the tape as a souvenir,

774
01:10:28,715 --> 01:10:30,435
but Matthew's the one
that took it, Sheriff.

775
01:10:30,588 --> 01:10:33,629
Look at this. Silly bastard
left me a present last night.

776
01:10:33,797 --> 01:10:35,964
He's obsessed with her, man.

777
01:10:38,132 --> 01:10:40,589
I think he even feels guilty.

778
01:10:40,757 --> 01:10:43,923
You dipshits bring him to me.

779
01:10:45,757 --> 01:10:47,588
I'm gonna cut
his retard pecker off

780
01:10:47,756 --> 01:10:49,631
and use it as a goddamn
hood ornament.

781
01:10:49,799 --> 01:10:52,005
That's before I'm done shoving it
up your dirt hole.

782
01:10:52,173 --> 01:10:53,966
Shit, we've been looking
for him, Sheriff.

783
01:10:54,134 --> 01:10:56,049
Trust me, we've been
everywhere looking for him.

784
01:11:12,049 --> 01:11:13,881
I want him found tonight.

785
01:11:15,299 --> 01:11:16,714
Or I swear to Christ,

786
01:11:16,882 --> 01:11:19,923
I'll bring the wrath of God
down on you.

787
01:11:55,385 --> 01:11:57,718
Can you believe there used
to be a limit on quail?

788
01:11:57,886 --> 01:12:01,175
Goddamn things
are like locusts now.

789
01:12:01,344 --> 01:12:03,717
Much to our good fortune.

790
01:12:05,968 --> 01:12:08,175
I gotta take a break.

791
01:12:08,343 --> 01:12:10,926
My dogs are barking
something fierce.

792
01:12:14,843 --> 01:12:16,843
I remember when you and my old man
chased that buck

793
01:12:16,886 --> 01:12:19,925
out from the hollows
on Stickler Farm before bagging it.

794
01:12:21,176 --> 01:12:24,341
Aww. Them were
the good old days.

795
01:12:24,509 --> 01:12:27,300
To the good old days.

796
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:30,927
Well, fancy. To what do I owe?

797
01:12:31,095 --> 01:12:32,427
You just enjoy it.

798
01:12:39,635 --> 01:12:42,468
This is some fine whiskey.

799
01:12:44,428 --> 01:12:48,262
Usually you don't get
something like this except at baptisms

800
01:12:48,429 --> 01:12:50,760
and weddings.

801
01:12:50,928 --> 01:12:53,260
And funerals.

802
01:13:00,969 --> 01:13:02,386
Loose ends, Earl.

803
01:13:06,471 --> 01:13:08,552
Loose ends.

804
01:13:27,139 --> 01:13:30,011
Matthew.

805
01:13:32,472 --> 01:13:35,221
I'm over here.

806
01:13:41,805 --> 01:13:43,803
Matthew.

807
01:13:47,597 --> 01:13:50,138
Matthew.

808
01:14:19,641 --> 01:14:23,641
I-I knew-knew you were alive.

809
01:14:25,307 --> 01:14:26,763
I knew it.

810
01:14:26,932 --> 01:14:29,306
How did you know, Matthew?

811
01:14:29,474 --> 01:14:31,597
Huh?

812
01:14:31,765 --> 01:14:34,182
How did you know I was alive?

813
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:37,931
Are you sure
you're not dreaming?

814
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,222
Am I?

815
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:44,140
Am I dreaming?

816
01:14:44,307 --> 01:14:46,558
Come here.

817
01:14:46,723 --> 01:14:48,557
Sit with me.

818
01:14:58,684 --> 01:15:02,515
I need to tell you-

819
01:15:02,683 --> 01:15:05,306
Shh!

820
01:15:07,642 --> 01:15:11,184
I know, Matthew.

821
01:15:11,350 --> 01:15:13,600
I know this wasn't your fault.

822
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:17,933
You tried to help me.

823
01:15:18,101 --> 01:15:19,767
I did.

824
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:23,933
I really really did.

825
01:15:26,684 --> 01:15:28,391
And-and-

826
01:15:28,559 --> 01:15:30,559
and you're okay.

827
01:15:30,726 --> 01:15:34,599
You're-you're okay.

828
01:15:34,767 --> 01:15:38,768
Yes, Matthew.

829
01:15:41,976 --> 01:15:43,599
Now come.

830
01:15:48,643 --> 01:15:50,476
Come on.

831
01:15:50,644 --> 01:15:56,351
It's okay.

832
01:15:56,519 --> 01:16:00,312
- I'm sorry.
- Shh. Come on.

833
01:16:00,478 --> 01:16:03,601
I'm so sorry.

834
01:16:09,810 --> 01:16:13,352
Oh God!

835
01:16:21,395 --> 01:16:23,310
I'm so sorry.

836
01:16:23,477 --> 01:16:25,268
Matthew.

837
01:16:29,271 --> 01:16:31,562
- Matthew.
- Yeah.

838
01:16:31,729 --> 01:16:33,645
- Matthew, look at me.
- Yeah.

839
01:16:38,603 --> 01:16:39,883
Tell me again how sorry you are.

840
01:17:00,437 --> 01:17:03,478
I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.

841
01:17:06,147 --> 01:17:08,979
It's just not good enough!

842
01:17:17,981 --> 01:17:20,479
Matthew!

843
01:17:25,312 --> 01:17:27,396
Matthew!

844
01:17:29,814 --> 01:17:32,563
Matthew!

845
01:17:34,856 --> 01:17:42,856
Matthew!

846
01:18:00,982 --> 01:18:03,066
Come on out, Matthew.

847
01:18:07,524 --> 01:18:09,523
Matthew!

848
01:18:26,816 --> 01:18:28,816
Matthew?

849
01:18:36,484 --> 01:18:39,484
You're only making it harder
on yourself, Matt.

850
01:18:52,275 --> 01:18:54,817
Stupid fuck,
what the hell's wrong with you?

851
01:19:03,316 --> 01:19:05,316
Fucker's playing your song.

852
01:19:11,068 --> 01:19:12,900
Your ass is grass, Matthew.

853
01:19:13,068 --> 01:19:15,733
Matthew, you're a dead man.

854
01:19:15,901 --> 01:19:17,984
Whoo!

855
01:19:22,236 --> 01:19:25,152
Come on, man.
I'm gonna kill him.

856
01:19:25,319 --> 01:19:27,485
Don't you pass out on me.

857
01:19:27,651 --> 01:19:30,486
I'm too tired to drag
your ass back.

858
01:19:38,277 --> 01:19:41,610
What the hell?

859
01:19:41,778 --> 01:19:43,944
Matthew?

860
01:19:46,987 --> 01:19:49,317
Matthew!

861
01:19:49,486 --> 01:19:52,860
God damn it, Matthew,
where are you?

862
01:19:53,027 --> 01:19:56,403
Where are you,
you little fucker?

863
01:20:02,861 --> 01:20:05,612
Andy, he ain't out here.

864
01:20:12,153 --> 01:20:14,153
You little bitch.

865
01:20:22,820 --> 01:20:26,654
Andy! Andy!

866
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:29,611
Andy, help me!

867
01:20:32,363 --> 01:20:33,736
What the fuck, man?

868
01:20:33,904 --> 01:20:35,444
- My leg!
- Ahem.

869
01:20:37,114 --> 01:20:38,779
Andy!

870
01:21:23,657 --> 01:21:26,281
Stanley!

871
01:21:30,157 --> 01:21:33,780
Stanley, help me!

872
01:21:33,948 --> 01:21:36,655
Matthew?

873
01:21:36,823 --> 01:21:39,613
Help me! Please!

874
01:21:44,157 --> 01:21:45,281
Somebody!

875
01:21:45,448 --> 01:21:47,948
Stanley!

876
01:21:50,782 --> 01:21:52,823
Come on, Stanley.

877
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:59,075
Matthew, this shit
ain't funny, boy.

878
01:22:01,031 --> 01:22:03,073
Somebody help me!

879
01:22:03,241 --> 01:22:05,492
Smile real pretty
for the camera, boy.

880
01:22:05,658 --> 01:22:08,283
Please!

881
01:22:11,243 --> 01:22:14,492
I know you like to watch,
don't you?

882
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:17,741
Don't you, you sick fuck?

883
01:22:17,907 --> 01:22:21,616
Don't worry,
I'll give you quite a show.

884
01:22:21,783 --> 01:22:23,909
Matthew!

885
01:22:26,242 --> 01:22:28,491
Matthew!

886
01:22:32,534 --> 01:22:34,576
- Here you go.
- Stanley!

887
01:22:34,741 --> 01:22:36,491
You remember this?

888
01:22:36,659 --> 01:22:38,992
Stanley, help me!

889
01:22:48,909 --> 01:22:50,659
Somebody help me!

890
01:22:51,994 --> 01:22:54,868
Help!

891
01:22:55,035 --> 01:22:57,160
Can't talk, can you?

892
01:22:57,327 --> 01:23:00,661
Maybe it's because
you're hungry.

893
01:23:05,952 --> 01:23:09,493
You know, you gotta eat a lot
of nasty shit out here to stay alive.

894
01:23:14,369 --> 01:23:17,701
Are you hungry? You hungry?

895
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:23,285
What's wrong? You don't like it?

896
01:23:38,370 --> 01:23:40,327
What are you doing?

897
01:23:40,497 --> 01:23:42,828
Some fishing.

898
01:23:45,037 --> 01:23:46,995
I know how you guys
like to fish.

899
01:24:19,913 --> 01:24:21,913
Don't blink.

900
01:24:22,955 --> 01:24:25,369
You okay, Stan?

901
01:24:53,748 --> 01:24:55,747
How's it going?

902
01:25:14,789 --> 01:25:16,705
I'm sorry.

903
01:25:21,542 --> 01:25:23,623
Please!

904
01:25:23,791 --> 01:25:27,624
Please is what I said to you.

905
01:25:27,792 --> 01:25:30,165
You said...

906
01:25:30,332 --> 01:25:32,123
"Suck it, bitch."

907
01:25:36,791 --> 01:25:38,457
Does that ring any bells?

908
01:25:38,625 --> 01:25:40,623
Suck...

909
01:25:40,791 --> 01:25:43,125
it...

910
01:25:43,294 --> 01:25:44,499
bitch!

911
01:25:52,292 --> 01:25:54,749
Be right back.

912
01:25:56,709 --> 01:26:00,125
Wait, come back. Come back here.

913
01:26:00,293 --> 01:26:02,999
Come back here.

914
01:26:05,417 --> 01:26:08,249
Stanley!

915
01:26:10,084 --> 01:26:12,501
I'm gonna fucking kill you,
you bitch.

916
01:26:15,419 --> 01:26:18,832
Hi.

917
01:26:19,001 --> 01:26:20,333
You like the show so far?

918
01:26:20,501 --> 01:26:21,958
Let me out of here!

919
01:26:22,126 --> 01:26:24,668
Wait.

920
01:26:24,836 --> 01:26:26,210
It gets better.

921
01:26:26,378 --> 01:26:30,210
Please, my eyes.

922
01:26:30,377 --> 01:26:33,251
I can't take it anymore.

923
01:26:33,419 --> 01:26:36,001
Oh, let me help you.

924
01:26:48,002 --> 01:26:49,500
Let me out!

925
01:26:52,002 --> 01:26:53,459
Stanley!

926
01:26:53,627 --> 01:27:00,168
Please.

927
01:27:01,378 --> 01:27:04,294
Please. Please.

928
01:27:10,629 --> 01:27:12,460
That might feel better.

929
01:27:17,378 --> 01:27:19,253
Help!

930
01:27:25,211 --> 01:27:28,003
Huh-uh-uh,
now don't drown too soon.

931
01:27:38,836 --> 01:27:40,711
Fuck you.

932
01:27:40,879 --> 01:27:43,545
Now is that any way
to talk to a lady?

933
01:28:00,337 --> 01:28:01,464
I'm impressed.

934
01:28:01,630 --> 01:28:03,671
You got a lot of fight in you.

935
01:28:03,839 --> 01:28:05,921
Let's see how you do now.

936
01:28:07,714 --> 01:28:10,380
What's that?

937
01:28:10,549 --> 01:28:13,088
It's just some lye
I found laying around.

938
01:28:17,173 --> 01:28:19,297
No!

939
01:28:22,215 --> 01:28:23,880
Let's see how long you can keep

940
01:28:24,048 --> 01:28:26,338
that pretty little face of yours.

941
01:28:26,506 --> 01:28:28,547
Fuck you!

942
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:32,422
You already did that.

943
01:28:32,590 --> 01:28:34,755
I didn't enjoy it much.

944
01:28:34,923 --> 01:28:38,547
Now it's my turn to fuck you.

945
01:28:40,298 --> 01:28:42,840
- Please. Please.
- Oh.

946
01:28:43,006 --> 01:28:44,881
Please.

947
01:30:18,844 --> 01:30:21,010
Pain in the ass.

948
01:30:29,678 --> 01:30:31,678
Good morning.

949
01:30:34,136 --> 01:30:36,759
Hey there. Can I fill you up?

950
01:31:11,180 --> 01:31:13,510
It's date night.

951
01:31:26,305 --> 01:31:28,304
Your mouth doesn't look so good.

952
01:31:29,555 --> 01:31:32,304
Maybe you should show me
your teeth.

953
01:31:46,681 --> 01:31:48,721
I'll kill you.

954
01:31:48,889 --> 01:31:50,220
I'll kill you.

955
01:31:55,806 --> 01:31:57,846
Ornery stallion.

956
01:31:59,805 --> 01:32:02,014
Guess I'm gonna
have to tame you.

957
01:32:17,183 --> 01:32:20,848
See, that's the problem.
You still have some teeth left.

958
01:32:21,015 --> 01:32:24,014
I'm gonna have to
take care of that.

959
01:32:32,348 --> 01:32:34,348
Huh? Huh?

960
01:32:34,516 --> 01:32:37,432
No fucking teeth, show horse.
No fucking teeth!

961
01:32:43,058 --> 01:32:45,298
Better save your strength
'cause you got a few more races

962
01:32:45,309 --> 01:32:47,014
left to run, show horse.

963
01:33:10,017 --> 01:33:12,683
That is disgusting.

964
01:33:14,642 --> 01:33:17,184
Even your boys
didn't piss themselves.

965
01:33:23,644 --> 01:33:26,475
Look who's here.

966
01:33:26,643 --> 01:33:29,894
It's my boyfriend.

967
01:33:30,059 --> 01:33:32,267
Remember him?

968
01:33:34,226 --> 01:33:36,308
Why don't you give him
a little kiss?

969
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:42,516
Let's go, come on.

970
01:33:42,685 --> 01:33:45,893
I don't take orders
from no fucking woman.

971
01:33:46,059 --> 01:33:47,809
No?

972
01:33:51,685 --> 01:33:53,934
Breathe through your nose.

973
01:33:54,102 --> 01:33:56,310
Breathe through your nose.
Come on.

974
01:33:56,477 --> 01:33:58,685
Just like it was
your first time, remember?

975
01:34:07,186 --> 01:34:14,810
Fuck you!

976
01:34:24,769 --> 01:34:26,644
Let me tell you something:

977
01:34:26,810 --> 01:34:29,477
You know,

978
01:34:29,645 --> 01:34:32,519
you weren't even a good blowjob.

979
01:34:38,729 --> 01:34:39,894
No.

980
01:34:41,312 --> 01:34:43,354
You know what they do to horses

981
01:34:43,522 --> 01:34:45,478
that can't be tamed, Johnny?

982
01:34:49,854 --> 01:34:51,645
You geld them.

983
01:34:57,189 --> 01:34:58,896
No teeth, show horse.

984
01:34:59,062 --> 01:35:01,146
No teeth.

985
01:35:09,063 --> 01:35:11,105
Bitch!

986
01:36:02,649 --> 01:36:05,397
Hey, sweetheart.

987
01:36:05,565 --> 01:36:09,399
Chastity's new teacher's here.
Mrs. Novick?

988
01:36:09,565 --> 01:36:13,024
No, from the honors program.

989
01:36:13,192 --> 01:36:16,522
Do you remember anything?
Oh yeah, that's right.

990
01:36:17,899 --> 01:36:20,397
I'm real busy, sweetheart.
Hey, Daddy.

991
01:36:20,565 --> 01:36:23,191
Hello, angel.

992
01:36:23,356 --> 01:36:25,357
Daddy's real busy working.

993
01:36:25,525 --> 01:36:27,285
But I really want you
to meet my new teacher.

994
01:36:28,984 --> 01:36:30,525
She's way cool.

995
01:36:32,523 --> 01:36:34,733
Here. Just say hi.

996
01:36:37,483 --> 01:36:39,149
Howdy, Sheriff.

997
01:36:39,317 --> 01:36:41,358
It's truly an honor

998
01:36:41,526 --> 01:36:43,317
to speak with you, Miss...

999
01:36:43,484 --> 01:36:45,692
Hills, Jennifer Hills.

1000
01:36:50,067 --> 01:36:52,192
Excuse me?

1001
01:36:52,359 --> 01:36:55,193
I have to tell you it's been
a pleasure meeting your family.

1002
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:57,566
You have a wonderful daughter

1003
01:36:57,734 --> 01:37:00,524
with a bright
and promising future.

1004
01:37:02,151 --> 01:37:04,651
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

1005
01:37:04,817 --> 01:37:06,440
We'll see you soon, Sheriff.

1006
01:37:06,609 --> 01:37:08,024
No, wait!

1007
01:37:15,027 --> 01:37:16,736
Shit!

1008
01:37:39,277 --> 01:37:40,443
Chastity, where is she?

1009
01:37:40,611 --> 01:37:41,776
She went to Hanson Park
with Miss Hills.

1010
01:37:41,944 --> 01:37:44,824
She wanted to get to know her students
in the program before the year st-

1011
01:37:44,944 --> 01:37:46,693
God damn it!

1012
01:37:46,861 --> 01:37:48,152
Who is she?

1013
01:37:50,529 --> 01:37:52,278
Who is this woman?

1014
01:38:15,030 --> 01:38:23,030
Chastity!

1015
01:38:27,778 --> 01:38:30,028
Where are you, angel?

1016
01:38:37,822 --> 01:38:39,822
Chastity!

1017
01:39:21,530 --> 01:39:24,614
Oh no! No!

1018
01:39:24,781 --> 01:39:26,364
Please!

1019
01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:31,697
No.

1020
01:39:37,782 --> 01:39:40,031
Help me, Jesus.

1021
01:39:40,199 --> 01:39:42,365
Does that hurt, Sheriff?

1022
01:39:44,991 --> 01:39:47,865
Come on,
I thought you were an ass man.

1023
01:39:48,033 --> 01:39:51,032
Where is she, you bitch?

1024
01:39:54,159 --> 01:39:57,867
I'd be real careful
how you talk to me right now, Sheriff.

1025
01:39:58,035 --> 01:40:01,033
What have you done to her?

1026
01:40:04,201 --> 01:40:06,781
By her, I assume
you mean your daughter?

1027
01:40:08,367 --> 01:40:10,823
She really is lovely, Sheriff.

1028
01:40:13,783 --> 01:40:16,531
So young.

1029
01:40:16,699 --> 01:40:18,365
So sweet.

1030
01:40:20,116 --> 01:40:22,574
So innocent.

1031
01:40:26,618 --> 01:40:29,992
I mean, can you imagine?

1032
01:40:30,160 --> 01:40:32,115
Imagine what?

1033
01:40:37,325 --> 01:40:39,866
Imagine that somebody
had done something

1034
01:40:40,034 --> 01:40:42,992
like this to her.

1035
01:40:45,494 --> 01:40:48,202
Someone like Andy.

1036
01:40:48,369 --> 01:40:51,492
Or Stanley or Johnny.

1037
01:40:51,660 --> 01:40:53,034
Or more likely you,

1038
01:40:53,202 --> 01:40:56,035
you sick, perverted rapist!

1039
01:40:59,744 --> 01:41:03,535
- Deep deep deep!
- Fuck!

1040
01:41:03,703 --> 01:41:06,202
Deep! Deep!

1041
01:41:06,369 --> 01:41:07,992
Deep! Deep! Deep!

1042
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:10,534
Jesus fucking Jesus.

1043
01:41:17,703 --> 01:41:20,119
Please.

1044
01:41:24,368 --> 01:41:27,201
Ma'am. Ma'am.

1045
01:41:36,038 --> 01:41:38,537
She's just an innocent girl.

1046
01:41:47,828 --> 01:41:49,828
So was l.

1047
01:41:57,370 --> 01:42:00,037
What are you doing? What?

1048
01:42:04,245 --> 01:42:06,621
Matthew.

1049
01:42:17,372 --> 01:42:19,411
You won't get
a-fucking-way with this.

1050
01:42:22,164 --> 01:42:24,205
You won't get away with this!

1051
01:42:26,998 --> 01:42:30,037
He'll be waking up soon.

1052
01:42:30,205 --> 01:42:32,538
If I were you,
I'd tell him not to move.

1053
01:42:32,706 --> 01:42:35,371
Please, I'm begging you.

1054
01:42:36,832 --> 01:42:38,998
I'm a God-fearing person.

1055
01:42:39,166 --> 01:42:40,580
I got-

1056
01:42:40,749 --> 01:42:43,995
I've got a baby coming, please.

1057
01:42:44,163 --> 01:42:46,873
Please, I'm begging you.
We can figure something out.

1058
01:42:47,039 --> 01:42:49,705
Sorry, Sheriff.

1059
01:42:49,873 --> 01:42:52,289
It was fun while it lasted.

1060
01:42:57,166 --> 01:43:00,705
Ma'am. Ma'am, please.

1061
01:43:00,872 --> 01:43:03,372
I'm begging you to help me.

1062
01:43:03,540 --> 01:43:05,537
Please help me.

1063
01:43:05,705 --> 01:43:08,872
I've got a wife and family.

1064
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:11,080
Ma'am, please!

1065
01:43:12,833 --> 01:43:15,207
You fuck! You fuck!

1066
01:43:16,624 --> 01:43:18,332
You fuck!

1067
01:43:18,499 --> 01:43:20,373
Where are you going, you fuck?

1068
01:43:20,541 --> 01:43:22,707
I'll see you in hell!

1069
01:43:22,875 --> 01:43:25,208
I'll rape you in hell!

1070
01:43:25,374 --> 01:43:27,583
You're just a piece of meat.

1071
01:43:27,751 --> 01:43:29,374
I'll find you.

1072
01:43:29,542 --> 01:43:32,332
I'll hunt you down in hell,
you bitch!

1073
01:43:34,582 --> 01:43:37,749
- Matthew.
- Sheriff?

1074
01:43:37,917 --> 01:43:39,665
- Matthew, no.
- Sheriff.

1075
01:43:39,833 --> 01:43:42,082
Matthew!
