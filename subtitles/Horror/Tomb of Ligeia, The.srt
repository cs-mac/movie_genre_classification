4
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,000
China

5
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,000
Long ago a mythic battle between good and evil

6
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,400
played out in ancient China.

7
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,100
The country was torn by civil war

8
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,200
with many kingdoms struggling for land and power.

9
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,200
But one king had a ruthless ambition

10
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,400
to make himself emperor by the sword.

11
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:30,200
The other rulers hired assassins to kill the king before he could conquered them all.

12
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,300
Kingdom by kingdom, his army swept away everything in its path
and anyone who resisted

13
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:41,200
and anyone who resisted met terrible fate.

14
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,400
The country was his.

15
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,100
He was now  the emperor of all under heaven.

16
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,800
He enslaved his conquered enemies and forced them to build his great wall.

17
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:59,000
When they were died or useless he had them buried beneath it.

18
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,900
The emperor's mystics taught him mastery of the five elements.

19
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,100
Fire, water, earth, wood and metal.

20
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,200
His power seemed without limit.

21
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,800
He was a master of millions.

22
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:51,000
But like the lowliest peasant he could not stop growing old.

23
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,500
He needed to defeat his last enemy.

24
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,500
Death itself.

25
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,000
One day news came of a powerful witch

26
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,700
who was rumored to know the secret to eternal life.

27
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:17,100
He ordered the General Ming, his oldest friend and trusted ally to find her.

28
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,100
The witch was named Zi Yuan and she was nothing like the general expected.

29
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,000
On the western border to the monastery of Turfan.

30
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,700
There was house the greatest library in the ancient world

31
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,700
and Zi Yuan was sure the secret to eternal life was here.

32
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,200
It was the long lost oracle bones.

33
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,500
A collection of all the mystical secrets of the ancient world.

34
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,300
The emperor's answer was here.

35
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,200
Along with other magic beyond imagining.

36
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,500
She casted the spell in Sanskrit in ancient language that the emperor did not understand.

37
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
The curse must never be lifted,

38
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,500
or the emperor will rise again to enslave all of mankind.

39
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:14,100
On that dark day there will be nothing and no one to save us.

40
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,900
You can run but you can't hide.

41
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,700
Fly Fishing.

42
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,400
Hm... one o'clock.

43
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
Ten o'clock.

44
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,100
One o'clock... ten o'clock.

45
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,600
One o'....
and this is won't be for girl nothing to do..

46
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,900
Buy on this!

47
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,200
Eve,  I'm home.

48
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,100
Mrs O'Conell is at Book Tree, said she'll be home for dinner.

49
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,600
Oh, great, cause we're having fish.

50
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,900
You don't take I catch nothing, don't you?

51
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,900
I had the at most convinced, Sir.

52
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:47,000
There's a hook in your neck, Sir.
Shall I fetch the wire cutters ?

53
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,200
Now savely abort the airship, with the Mummy finally vanquished, dashed,

54
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,800
slaped Scarlet into his arms.

55
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,800
Oh God, Scarlet.
I thought I've lost you.

56
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,700
For a moment that you did.

57
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:18,200
Bay didn't raise of golden sunlight,

58
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,900
are hero sealed the very reunion with the kiss of timeless passion.

59
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,700
Bay loved deeper and sure than ever.

60
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,800
Miss O'Connell

61
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,700
We all dying to know, is this Scarlet Tukiv character really based on you?

62
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,600
Honestly I can say she's completely a different person.

63
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,100
Anymore question?

64
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,300
Miss O'Connell.
Is your life today as exciting as it was before the war?

65
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,500
I wish my life with that exciting now.

66
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,700
- Will be any other book in this series?
- Do you believe in happy ending?

67
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,300
Isn't this place full?

68
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,300
Dinner at home.

69
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,900
- Every night.
- Every night.

70
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,600
Here's the retirement.

71
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,500
May we stay this happy forever.

72
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,300
Still no letter from Alex.

73
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,400
I sent him three in the last month.

74
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,700
What do you expect?

75
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,800
I turn forgiven this kid when he gets kicked
out the college needs more money.

76
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,200
I am sure he's just buried in his studies.

77
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,800
So how your reading book go?

78
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,700
Oh fine, thank you.

79
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,700
Until they asked me when will be another mummy adventure.

80
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,200
But you did promise the publisher third book.

81
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,300
I know,

82
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,200
but I spent my night staring at a blank page completely blot.

83
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,900
We can skip dinner,

84
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,900
and I could attempt to.....

85
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,800
inspiring you.
Upstair?

86
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,100
Oh, that so sweet of you darling.

87
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,300
I am going to sit at that typewriter
until something exciting comes up.

88
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,100
Thank you.

89
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,500
Oh, trout.
How lovely.

90
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,900
So happy found the hobby that doesn't involve guns.

91
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,700
Good, Wilson is back.

92
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,500
You're couple days late, professor.

93
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,900
Oh my dear fellow, thank you for your concern.

94
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,100
Are you thirsty?
Yes, please, thank you.

95
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,700
Look, when I saw you're standing up there,

96
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,000
I thought I was looking at your father.
You really are Rick O'Connell's son.

97
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,900
We hopefully after the day,
you've be known as Alex O'Connell's father.

98
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,100
How a powerfull face.

99
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,100
When I told my colleagues at the museum that you have
discovered the colossal, they were thrilled.

100
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,700
- Yeah, however...
- I know.

101
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,800
how I'm i going to get in  that tomb.

102
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,700
Don't let the baggage get you down.

103
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:51,000
It was you who discovered the Bembridge journal,
I'm with you to discover the emperor.

104
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,400
I have a complete faith in you, Alex.

105
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,900
Thank you, professor.

106
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,700
Thanks for believing in me.

107
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,200
That mummy...

108
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,600
here...

109
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Filed mummy?

110
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,800
Cursed mummy.

111
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,700
Mysterious mummy.

112
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,300
Lick them mummy.

113
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
Rick, darling, where are you?

114
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,900
I am ready to be inspired.

115
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,400
Do you remember the time the mummy had me tied down?

116
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,200
And you came to save me.
And you...

117
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,500
...cut, no, you tore open the ropes, that's what you did.

118
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,300
Just he was about pulage his ...

119
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,800
Watch out!

120
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,400
Sir Collin Bembridge.

121
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,900
He went searching to this tomb seventy years ago

122
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,700
I have to notice this as warning.

123
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,600
Unfortunately this not death Bembridge can make us famous

124
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,700
Let's keep moving.

125
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,700
Look at that.

126
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,600
What is that?

127
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,300
Stop,
Alex, stay here.

128
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,900
Come on.

129
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,900
this gonna take just his territory and he known that by anyone.

130
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,100
Alright, good job.

131
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,600
All the warriors are facing into this point.

132
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,600
- It's for waiting nor of emperor.
- Where is he?

133
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,800
Is there thing some bloody grave robbers
pick to the prize to you?

134
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,100
No, he is still here.

135
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,200
See, this is a Feng Shui compass.

136
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:33,100
Okay, now. This.
Okay this is to north.

137
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,300
With the Feng Shui compass send me opposite direction.

138
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,500
Alright, we need the real one.

139
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,900
Alright, here we go.

140
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,200
Alex, it's me.

141
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,100
Are you alright?

142
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,500
Tell me have we found the emperor?

143
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,600
What is it?

144
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,500
It's totally the greatest finds since King Tut.

145
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,100
If he's awaken, all modest should despair

146
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,100
It's definitely him.

147
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,100
He even has his concubines to bury lie with him.

148
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,400
Selfish bastard.

149
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,400
Hey professor Wilson.
Will you come down and take a look?

150
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,600
Or you ... and so long we can talk?

151
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Let's go, professor.

152
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
We got a lot to do.

153
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:42,800
First of all I'd just like to say you ..... during the war.

154
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:47,200
But I've been sent of you one last assignment.

155
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,900
I am afraid we've retired from the espionage game.
Haven't we dear?

156
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,200
Yeah, we don't do it anymore.
We finished. Completely done.

157
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,500
It's totally curiosity, what's
is the misson anyway?

158
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,500
We need you to carry of this ...
to Shanghai.

159
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,500
- It's a piece of eyes.
- It's the eye of Shangri-La.

160
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,700
If you believe the legend appoints
the way to the pool of eternal life.

161
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,900
It was ***** of China in 1940.

162
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,500
Now the government like return it to Shanghai museum

163
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,600
as a sign good faith the Chinese people.

164
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:26,700
And with your expedition field bring it naturally,
both of you.

165
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,800
Oh we'd be so flatterred.

166
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:38,500
But Rick and I, we made a promise to each other after the war,
that we would settle down.

167
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,800
That's right, dear.
We didn't... we...

168
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,900
Well I must say that I'm a little dissapointed.

169
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,900
Post of China is very dangerous.

170
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:52,400
There are a lot of factions would love
get the hand on the eyes of Shangri-La.

171
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,200
In lesser hand, the eye could be lost forever.

172
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,200
We couldn't let that happened, could we?

173
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:02,300
- No, it could be bad for the world.
- Terrible!

174
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,400
You know, she has a brother lives in China.
- Jonathan!

175
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,100
Yes, he owns a nightclub, if I'm not mistaken?

176
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,100
We have been meaning to visit.
We could drop and surprise him.

177
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,600
- In a while?
- Why not.

178
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,700
Does this mean we can count on you one last time?

179
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,600
Yes you, Princess.

180
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,700
And  Imhotep, may the bugger actually stay there.

181
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,500
Hi, can you buy drink for me?

182
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,300
Excuse me.
Alex, Alex, you back again.

183
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,900
Come here let me get you a drink.

184
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,700
Make that two.

185
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,300
Sorry Uncle John,
but I got a better offer.

186
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,700
No, Alex, no, look, listen.

187
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,000
Come here.

188
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
To put it on archeological term,
that's a tomb in which many pharaoh were laid.

189
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,900
Now listen, listen.
Just think about me for a moment, alright.

190
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,600
Your discovery will go public in few days, and your parents are sort to find out.

191
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,700
They are not gonna be happy that you drop out the school, and....

192
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,700
Be relax, Uncle John.

193
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,700
I'm here, they're long away away....

194
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,700
Excuse me, I have some excavation to do.

195
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,200
- You are in China
- Eve, Rick. What are you... this is so...

196
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,400
- Brother, we love to see you.
- I don't know idea if he was here.

197
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,300
- Who is here?
- Who?

198
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,800
Go away!

199
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,800
I'm gonna kill you, kid!

200
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,800
Not so fast,.
That's my... kid

201
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,900
- Mad Dog Maguire?
- Ricochet O'Connell!

202
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,400
Let's we get back, and have a good time!

203
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,400
Music.

204
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:54,800
- How long has it been?
- Egypt, '23 French foreign legion.

205
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,000
This guy can land a plane on anything.

206
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,400
Ricochet, he has handed out of my girl.

207
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,700
He's son or not son, I got to give my beaten.

208
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,600
Get away, Dad.

209
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,400
It's to much I really like you to teach him a valuable lesson.

210
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,600
His mother would be upset.
Very upset!

211
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:14,700
Wive now, and kid.
Things are a little bit different, I'm sure you understand.

212
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,600
Let me make it out to you.

213
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I'm just surprised to see you here. That's all.
Alright?

214
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I'm now here five minutes,
and I'm already put you in the fire.

215
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
- You going back to college.
- I think it's not gonna worth it.

216
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,200
You two show up told me what to do.

217
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,900
Who?
We should sit down and discuss this like a family.

218
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,400
No, thanks mom.
We haven't been a family a long time.

219
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,400
Hey don't you bring your back on me.
Alex.

220
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,400
Alex, come here..

221
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,100
Don't look at me like this.

222
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,400
- It is your fault.
- My fault?

223
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,200
You're the one always smothering and

224
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,600
you came in more five minutes and wipe at his nose.

225
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,300
Perhaps I was over compensating for the fact that you've
never took interest into his life.

226
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,900
His life
is my top priority.

227
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,500
How many time that I said that he could break his neck?

228
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,000
A little warmth encouragement for difficult night.

229
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,500
I am his father.

230
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,400
It's implied.

231
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,000
We spent entire life searching for priceless artefacts,

232
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,500
and one thing that most precious, we've lost.

233
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,400
We can't let Alex becomes

234
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,900
a stranger pictures on a mantle.

235
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,500
- We can't let it to happen.
- No we can't.

236
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,600
How can we fix this?

237
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,100
We need to do it together.

238
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,200
I think it's faster if we took a ricksaw.

239
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,100
It's Chinese New Year.

240
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,400
Don't you love this country has so many holiday and

241
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,900
drinking is mandatory.

242
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,600
I can't believe
we've got to see your first big discovery.

243
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,600
It''s so exciting.

244
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,200
Listen, I pick you up about one hour.

245
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,700
You're not coming?

246
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,200
No, no.
I have seen enough mummies to last a lifetime.

247
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,200
There is.

248
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,200
Oh, my darling.
Very impressive.

249
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,900
- When you get to open the sarcophagus?
- I have to wait to official red tape has been cut.

250
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,100
The words rest in peace mean anything to you too?

251
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,000
So mom,  why don't you stick around for next few days

252
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,300
then we can open it together?

253
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,900
I would like that very much, thanks.

254
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,900
Alex.
Won't you go and tell professor Wilson that we are here.

255
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,600
Just, don't wake the big guy up when I'm gone.

256
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,300
This is all...

257
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,900
Really really big stuff.

258
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,800
Whatever you say, Dad.

259
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,800
I guess mummy bring up the best to me.

260
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,300
Take a wrong turn in Cairo?

261
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,500
Sorry to interrupt.

262
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,700
- Roger.
- Professor Roger Wilson.

263
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,900
Hello Rick.

264
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
You know when Alex told me that you going to Egypt,

265
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,500
I just couldn't believe my ears.

266
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:28,000
Now I just .... tombs
in the name of preservation.

267
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Congratulations on your latest discovery.

268
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,200
Alex deserves all the credits.

269
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,500
He's a heavenly kid.
He's a son I never had.

270
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,500
He's the only one we got.

271
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,100
So next time you send him on of your field trip
you give us a head up first ?

272
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Yes, of course.

273
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,600
And now I believe you have something belongs to us.

274
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,200
What's that?

275
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,000
Oh, you mean this?

276
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,800
For you.

277
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,300
I knew I can rely on you two.

278
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,700
I am afraid your work is not done yet.

279
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,500
Mr.  and Mrs O'Connell,
I'd like to introduce you to a friend of mine.

280
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,700
General Yang.

281
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,300
Well, he's the man who find out Alex's dig.

282
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,200
We're in this together.

283
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,100
The eye belongs to Chinese people.
You can't do this.

284
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,500
So Roger, you're snake.

285
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,600
How much did the Yin and Yang pay it?

286
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,600
Enough to pull strings on the foreign office.

287
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,300
Make sure that it was you two who delivered the eye.

288
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,600
Turn around.

289
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,600
The eye contains the elixir from the pool of eternal life.

290
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,300
I let you to open it.

291
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,200
Mrs. O'Connell

292
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:56,600
No. You're going to use it to wake the emperor, aren't you?

293
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,500
And his terracota army.

294
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,600
At least that's the general's idea.

295
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,200
Raising an army of mummies is insane

296
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,200
Listen, Yang.

297
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,800
Time to open the sarcophagus.

298
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,700
Move.

299
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,600
Read the inscription.
Now!

300
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,500
Ancient chinese isn't my forté.

301
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Here's some encouragement.
Wilson!

302
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,900
- Don't do it!
- No Eve, don't do it.

303
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,900
They just gonna kill me anyway.

304
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,800
The inscription says that only a drop of blood

305
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,800
from a person with a pure heart can open the Eye.

306
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,700
Your husband was right.

307
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:08,300
Only the pure heart who sacrifice themself for the one they love.

308
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,600
Open it.

309
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,300
You never called after our last date.

310
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,600
I don't have time for games. Alex

311
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,800
You know my name, but I don't know yours.

312
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,200
It's Lin.

313
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,600
You were one who explain me why you try to kill me?

314
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,000
We could do that or we could save your parents.

315
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,700
Wilson, you're son of a bitch.

316
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Get with it O'Connell.

317
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:54,300
Once this touch his hand, the emperor will rise.

318
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,400
To rule again.

319
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,400
Finish him all.

320
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:40,700
Alex, please, don't!

321
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,700
It's not him
It's a eunuch.

322
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,600
It's a decoy.

323
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,400
Where the hell  is the emperor?

324
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,600
Stay!

325
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,600
No!

326
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Here we go again.

327
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,600
Wait for me.
I'm coming with you.

328
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,800
Watch out!

329
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,700
The longer he awake, the stronger he get.

330
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,600
Open the gate!

331
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,300
Ya, ya, ya, I know.

332
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,600
You wanna drive?

333
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,000
- Why not.
- You're a woman who can drive the truck.

334
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,500
Hey pal, I'm sorry but...
Happy new year!

335
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,500
Hurry, honey!

336
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,800
Jonathan, get the back.

337
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,800
Sorry for the Rolls.

338
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,700
You guys are mummy magnets!

339
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,800
We have to turn you around!

340
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,200
Excuse me.

341
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,300
- Hey, we can use this.
- Give me that.

342
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,500
Oh ya, that's a better idea.

343
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,100
- Aim it to the emperor!
- Aim it to the emperor?

344
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,100
I'll try.

345
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,900
Fire!

346
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,000
Have we get them?

347
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
- Fire!
- What?

348
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,200
-Your ass on fire!
- My ass?

349
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,100
- My ass on fire!

350
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,100
Spank my ass!

351
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,500
Alright, here I come.

352
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,200
Give me your hand.

353
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:04,900
- Where are you going?
- Told me it's a shortcut.

354
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I told you it was a shortcut.

355
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Now they chase on us.

356
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,900
Give me your hand.
Here, you gonna need this.

357
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,900
- Don't wait for me.
- Where are you going?

358
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,500
Where is Rick?

359
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,300
Where do you think?

360
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Come here Alex.
Get on the horse.

361
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,800
Get back, Dad.

362
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:04,200
Alexander Wilbert O'Connell!
You gonna get on the back this horse!

363
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,900
Get out the way!

364
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,000
We've to go back to help Rick.

365
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Forget Rick!
Here they come!

366
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:40,700
I'll go after the emperor.

367
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:43,600
Trust me,
I got little more experience with the mummy.

368
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,000
And I have the only weapon that kill him.

369
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:50,000
OK 'll cover you.
Let's go!

370
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,500
- I think you were died.
- He missed.

371
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,100
Watch out!

372
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:33,500
Thanks Rick, will you pay the cab?
Does it look like  I have a wallet?

373
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,800
You know when I kill the emperor be too unblow my cover

374
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,500
and everything under control.

375
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,500
That exactly what we were thinking.

376
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,500
Oh yeah you could going and raise another mummy.

377
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,200
And this buggers got superpowers.

378
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,500
He got control over fire, water, and metal
and who knows what else.

379
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,500
- And you dig him up anyway.
- Hey you're not gonna pin this one on me, Dad.

380
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,500
Stop you two..

381
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,100
No one is to blame here.

382
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,900
- Wilson manipulated all of us.

383
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,200
I appologize for my parents.

384
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,300
But I, I thought we have through it well together.

385
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,300
Except we failed.

386
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,700
I'm sorry, we haven't been properly introduce.

387
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,800
- Who are you exactly?
- My name is Lin.

388
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:33,300
My family has watch over the emperor's tombs for centuries.

389
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:37,500
The emperor can not be killed.
Unless he's stabbed to the heart with this.

390
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:41,300
My mother put a curse on it long ago.

391
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,900
Well quickly we're meeting Alex.

392
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,200
- Sit.
- Down.

393
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,300
- What do you really know about this girl?
- Not much.

394
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,600
But after I help to know her to go on a little faith.

395
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,700
- Faith?
- Time is running out.

396
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,000
-You don't  believe the concept of personal space, do you?

397
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:05,600
If the emperor reach the Shangri-La,
and drinks from the pool of eternal life,

398
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,400
he will raise his army, and no one will be save.

399
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:12,600
But as I like to say this boy can be handsome forever.
Shangri-La is a crock.

400
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:16,000
We heard that's you used to say about mummies too Johny.
You did pretty well.

401
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:20,700
The gate way to Shangri-La lies in a mountain pass, high in Himalayas.

402
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,800
Beyond it, is a golden tower

403
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,500
Once the diamond is placed to the top,
it would point way to Shangri-La.

404
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,600
Yang still has the diamond.

405
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,600
And that he and the emperor will go.

406
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:36,000
She's right.
All the legends of the eye mention the gateway.

407
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,400
I look her Alex.
She knows what worth.

408
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,400
No just say that we were to believe you.

409
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,000
Could you guide us there?

410
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,800
Yes, I've been there once.

411
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,800
I remember the way.

412
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:53,100
Himalayas, it's flying with the plane.

413
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,900
I know just the Mad Dog for the job.

414
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,900
Well a selfrespecting pilot that would land on a valley floor,

415
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,000
But I don't have any self respect,
so I put you down half of the mountain.

416
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,300
Still it will give us advantage.

417
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:10,500
But no guarantee anyone will live.

418
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:17,500
I tell you to fasten your seat belt,
but it's to cheap to buy on it.

419
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,200
Why are you me laughing?

420
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,800
Here we go!

421
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:58,700
Nobody move, nobody move!

422
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,900
What is it goat awful smell?

423
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,300
The yak, the yak.

424
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,700
Delta. Tango. Alfa. to Ricochet.
Come in Ricochet.

425
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:58,200
Delta. Tango. Alpha. this is Ricochet.
Go ahead Mad Dog.

426
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,900
You know that Yang valley you told me to keep eye for.
He is just shown up.

427
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:04,000
Ricochet out.
Thanks Mad Dog.

428
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,700
That's all people.
Let's go.

429
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,600
- John, wake up
- What?

430
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:25,700
Here we go more than half way, we gonna camp there for the night.

431
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:43,100
Lin said as we leave as first life, we reach the gate by noon.

432
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,900
Did she happened to mention to know so much about the gateway?

433
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,900
No, not really.
Kind of mysterious.

434
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,400
She sadly manage to enchant you.

435
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:59,000
Come on Alex.
You obviously like her.

436
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,600
Mom, if been down there.
Clearly messing with your head.

437
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,000
What of secret that she's hiding here

438
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:11,100
just don't want to see you get hurt.

439
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,100
I appreciate that.

440
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:18,700
You know.
I had my faith share experience with the opposite sex.

441
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,500
Really?

442
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,400
How many experience that we're talking about?

443
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,400
You shouldn't ask a question if you don't want to know the answer.
OK mom?

444
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,500
Right!

445
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,700
Hey, Mom.

446
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,600
Sorry I blamed you guys for raising the emperor.

447
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,400
What is so funny?

448
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,800
My mother has an impression there's something between us.

449
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,300
I hope nothing romantic.

450
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:07,500
Well I have totally no chance for that.

451
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,200
We completely opposite in you and me, right?

452
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,700
You guard tombs, I raid them.

453
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:15,800
You like ancient knives, I'm man in guns.

454
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:18,000
Those in our bloods.

455
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,900
- Absolutely.
- Well, good.

456
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,100
Now you focus to take down the emperor.

457
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
I agree totally

458
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,900
Besides, you're not my type.

459
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:38,400
Of course not.
You don't like a woman who can knock on your back side.

460
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:43,800
Expression, kick my ass.

461
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:46,600
For the record, you didn't

462
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,500
That's not easy being me.

463
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,300
Maar ik denk dat het voor jou hetzelfde is.

464
00:54:56,100 --> 00:55:01,500
If I met a girl like you, Geraldine.
Yeah, hard work, and you don't say much.

465
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:06,200
A litlle bit hairy, but I don't mind that.

466
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:18,800
There it is!
We found it!

467
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,800
The cape lake Shangri-La.

468
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:39,100
Go, girl, go, go!
Free!

469
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,100
Go Geraldine!
We free!

470
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:55,400
What you to do now?
Rob an arbery?

471
00:55:55,500 --> 00:56:00,200
Have you ever seen a Walter P-38?
I have this peacekeeper.

472
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:04,700
Well, this is not the best size, Dad.
The best stamina.

473
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:07,700
You want power?

474
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:12,000
I get you a Thompson's submachine gun.

475
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:15,600
50 rounds a drum.
25 a mag.

476
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:19,400
Thommy is good, Dad.
But the kocking mechanism always jams.

477
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:24,600
Here, check out the russian PPS personal saw weapon.
Now this is the future right here.

478
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:27,800
You know experience is who wins today it's not all about the fire power.

479
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:31,700
Boys, if I may?
Have we a plan for the emperor?

480
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:35,500
Ya, we gonna hit high hard fast and smash him like a Ming vas.

481
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:38,400
An if it doesn't work?
We go to plan B.

482
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,600
Plan B!
You go upstairs, you blow that gold tower thing.

483
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,400
You laid it up the body sky high.

484
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,900
Dad, if explossion doesn't kill us, avalanche will.

485
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:48,300
You got a better idea?

486
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:52,600
I said we ambush in the long way drive with silencer...

487
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,800
We can finish him off with Lin's dagger.

488
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,400
Look, I am sorry I just don't for much your girlfriend's magic dagger.

489
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:02,100
She's not my girlfriend.
- You say that now. When I still don't trust her.

490
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Well I do. She trusted my judgement. Okay?

491
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,700
Look kid. I put down more mummies than you.

492
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:11,800
- You put down one mummy, Dad.
- Yes, say mummy, twice!

493
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:18,800
Hand me the green wire.
Will you, please?

494
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,100
- Are you sure you know what you are doing?
- Of course I've done this a houndred times.

495
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,300
If the emperor places the eye pair, all will be lost.

496
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,600
Let's give 'em up a warm O'Connells welcome.

497
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,200
Fire!

498
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,700
We've got take out the bazookas!

499
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,200
Now!

500
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Move, move, move...

501
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,600
Time to go to plan B, blow the tower.

502
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:20,800
Hey, I am not actually concern about the plan B.
Can we go straight to the plan C?

503
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:23,000
Just back, and go back.
I cover you up.

504
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,500
Okay, let it go!
Come on! Come on!

505
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:03,100
My last ones

506
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:09,100
Yeti!
Where are you?

507
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:14,500
I need you!
Yeti! Come now, quick!

508
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:27,500
Appearable snowman?

509
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:30,100
The Tibetan called them Yeti.

510
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
She speaks Yeti?

511
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,800
Why do I always have to save the day?

512
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,400
Get the other guy!

513
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:23,500
You can die slow or you can die fast?

514
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,600
Ya! I did it!

515
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,600
Oh, man.
I did it.

516
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,500
Time to retreat I think.

517
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:02,300
I'm in your team.

518
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:06,000
I'm a team player!
One for all, all for me, kind of thing?

519
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,100
The dynamite, always dynamite!
We should

520
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,900
get out of here..

521
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:27,800
Wow, back off!
Back of!

522
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,800
I hate mummies!
They never play fair.

523
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:09,500
Dad!
What are you doing?

524
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:19,800
Over here!
Over here, come on!

525
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,800
Shangri-La!!!

526
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,500
That's a diamond.

527
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,800
I can use a diamond like that.

528
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:34,300
Dad!

529
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Avalanche!

530
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:30,700
Help!
Help me!

531
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,600
Please, help me!

532
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,600
I'm fine, and I'm still alive.

533
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:28,000
Help me please, somebody help me?

534
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,500
We're here!

535
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:34,100
Mom, we're down here!

536
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,300
Oh my god.

537
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:54,300
We've got to take them to Shangri-La.
Now it's an only chance.

538
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:14,500
We've made it!

539
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,000
The pool!

540
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:40,200
Thank you.

541
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:45,400
You must rest.
We'll take you into my chamber.

542
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:15,200
Well it's not everyone that gets the brother all from the death.

543
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,100
Is this Shangri-La?

544
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:38,400
I can live here.
Lots of opportunity

545
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:41,100
A casino.

546
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:05,200
Now rest them all. Thank you.

547
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,700
How can you get involved in all of this?

548
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:12,300
The emperor murdered the only man I've ever loved.

549
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,700
Lin's father.

550
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:16,900
I would have died too by his hand...

551
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,000
...if the Yeti had not found me and brought me to this pool.

552
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:26,800
How old is this happened?
Is is before the Christ?

553
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:31,600
How long you've got in this tomb?

554
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:34,300
Over two thousand years.

555
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,100
The emperor must never be allowed to reach the pool.

556
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:44,100
Or he will have the power to raise his army.

557
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:50,700
Once he becomes immortal, he can transform himself
into the most hedious creature ever seen.

558
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,800
I will check the first watch at the entrance.

559
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:04,800
I have no problem dating an older woman.

560
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:08,500
I'm afraid we can't be together.

561
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:12,300
Why?

562
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:15,200
Because I'm gonna live forever.

563
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,400
I don't want to watch you die.

564
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:21,500
So what? That's it?

565
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:24,300
You just gonna see the sideline for eternity.

566
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:28,900
My mother has mourned of my father for the centuries.

567
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,000
I don't know if my heart can bear it.

568
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:38,100
People can live in entire lifetime if one want.

569
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:43,100
I want my parents to live everyday.

570
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,800
Alex, your father is awake.
In up here.

571
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:10,700
If this is heaven, it is pretty good so far.

572
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:22,400
Nice to see something has never changed.

573
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,400
Go easy on him, he feels terrible.

574
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:48,300
I saw you laying there, Dad.

575
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:52,200
I've never been so scared in my life.

576
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:55,500
Well, I'm get used two of us.

577
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,400
You supposed to die.
You know you're Ricochet O'Connell, right?

578
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:05,400
You beat up us around but you still stand in the end.

579
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,400
I really never thought a world without you.

580
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,500
The truth is

581
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,500
I am just trying ...

582
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:26,600
I am just ...

583
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:29,900
I am trying to be a good husband and I am trying to be a good parent

584
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,400
and the truth is I've been dropped the both.

585
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
I've been a world greatest's son.

586
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:38,800
I know it's good cause I  rise a family.

587
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:40,900
Come here.

588
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:45,800
My boys.

589
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:24,200
Oh, no.
His power has been fully restored.

590
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:25,800
Time to go.

591
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
He is immortal.

592
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:34,500
Hey you three any shape something son of a bitch.

593
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,700
He is taking her back to his tomb ro raise his army.

594
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:16,200
- Is there any faster way down from here?
- The Yeti. No help.

595
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,100
But he's already on the air.
It will be too late.

596
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:21,800
Mad Dog have quite three headed lizards anyday in the week.
Let's go

597
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:29,400
Foreside, at nine o'clock.

598
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:39,400
Should I quit drinking?

599
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:47,600
Jonathan to Rick.
You've better get move on if you gonna be to the tomb.

600
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:50,600
Just back here as fast you can reinforcement, not sight seeing.

601
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Here, Dad.

602
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:57,700
Lent me?
Nice.

603
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:02,000
The terracotta army is not indestructible until  they cross the great wall.

604
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:05,600
How it exactly we supposed send them of?

605
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:11,000
When the emperor build the wall he buried his enemies
underneath then curses souls to hold it up eternity.

606
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,100
Most of them the conquered soldiers.

607
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:15,600
I will call them to battle once again.

608
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:20,400
My mark on altar, rise an army,  that sounds like a plan.

609
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:21,800
Let's go.

610
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:59,600
- Alex. Where he go?
- Where do you think?

611
01:20:55,100 --> 01:21:00,500
Open the gate of the past and free the souls of the wrong who he's damned.

612
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:15,000
In the name of the ancesters and rightious,
I sacrifice my immortality and that's of my daughter

613
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:16,700
so that you may rise this day.

614
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:34,100
Bring down the rough of the oppressed on his emperor and all who follow him.

615
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:46,300
I call of the hundreds, and the thousands,

616
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:49,100
that you may rise up and seize this moment

617
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:51,400
to take your victory

618
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,100
to take your justice.

619
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:55,100
And to take your revenge!

620
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:41,800
These  are

621
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:43,900
your good dead guys, right?

622
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:50,100
Zi Yuan sent us.

623
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,600
Do we speak English?

624
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,300
We're with Zi Yuan.

625
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:35,100
It's coming.

626
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:25,100
Welcome in twentieth century.

627
01:26:56,700 --> 01:26:59,100
I really hate mummies.

628
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:08,700
Run!

629
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:56,500
Die you mummy bastard!
Die!

630
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:59,300
There's no call for the bad language.

631
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:31,800
Have you regret, darling?

632
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,000
None, not ever.

633
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:46,600
- You OK?
- Yeah, sure.

634
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,000
No problem

635
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
We had completely under control.

636
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:55,100
