00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
- Procured. Good word.
- Yes.

147
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,500
Okay. There he is,
Michael Rockefeller.

148
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,500
- Can I see?
- Check him out, girls.

149
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,600
- He looks like a beatnik.
- ''1961.

150
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,700
''Twenty-three-year-old
Michael Rockefeller...

151
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,300
boat capsized off the coast
of New Guinea.''

152
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,600
- Uh, that's right on. It's right-
- Yeah.

153
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,600
And just to kind of throw this in there.

154
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,700
There's been a huge mystery, like, legend
around the guy for the last 30 years.

155
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,400
Multiple sightings in New Guinea, uh,
of a white dude with a big beard.

156
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,500
Sometimes spectacles.

157
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,900
Yeah. It says Rockefeller family
offered $1 00,000...

158
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,600
for any- any whereabouts- any information
on his whereabouts in 1 961 .

159
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,300
So wait. He was-
He was our age when he went missing.

160
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,600
- Yeah.
- Yeah. So he'd be in his 60s now.

161
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Yeah. Sixty-five, 7 0.

162
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,500
So, I think
the most popularly held belief...

163
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,500
is that he was captured
by ''cannibals'' and eaten.

164
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,800
No. That's just one of the beliefs.

165
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,200
I still think he's alive and kicking it.

166
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,800
They actually prefer the taste of meat...

167
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,600
that is still on the flesh
of a human that is living.

168
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,700
Oh. I would too.

169
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,100
They actually keep them alive.
They go limb by limb.

170
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,100
- Uh-huh?
- I've got good loin.

171
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
- <i>[ Colby ] Be a shitty way to go.</i>
- Yeah. If you're gonna eat something,
keep it fresh.

172
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,000
<i>[ Colby ]</i>
<i>So, we gonna do this or what?</i>

173
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,300
Look. We're all here. Right?

174
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,400
We're all having a good time. I don't know
why we have to pick up and move.

175
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,300
Hey, you know, this morning
when you were surfing with Colby...

176
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,500
Hey, you know, this morning
when you were surfing with Colby...

177
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,300
I decided to check Michael Rockefeller
out on the Internet.

178
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,400
just sounds a little crazy to me.

179
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,800
The Rockefeller family themselves
have already claimed his death.

180
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,900
Surviving 45 years out in the jungle?

181
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
I- I don't think so.

182
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,800
They have more money than us.
More manpower. More- More expertise.

183
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,500
More knowledge.
They hired the best anthropologists
from the best universities in the U.S.

184
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,700
Maybe- Maybe it's not that implausible,
you know. Maybe- Maybe he's still alive.

185
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,700
And even if he is,
who says he wants to be found?

186
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,600
I mean, there's- there's people that-

187
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,600
that live in really remote areas
for years and years.

188
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,200
Think about it. This guy was born
into the lap of privilege.

189
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,700
Maybe he didn't want to
belong to it anymore.

190
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,000
Maybe he wanted to pursue
something a lot more simple...

191
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,500
a lot more pure,
a lot more precious.

192
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,600
You know, each to his own.
Maybe he's still out there.

193
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,900
Maybe it's a mystery for a reason.

194
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,200
Who gives a shit
about Michael Rockefeller anymore?

195
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,200
A lot of people. He was one of
the biggest stories of the last century.

196
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,300
-It's one of the biggest stories of the last century.
-He was in <i>Life</i> magazine.

197
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,700
He was in <i>Life</i> magazine.

198
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,300
There was three television specials.

199
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,100
- Three television specials.
- There's, like, 1 0 books about him.

200
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,200
- Ten books.
- I think they're making a movie
in Hollywood right now.

201
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,300
They're making a movie about him
in Hollywood right now.

202
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,800
I guarantee you. We go there,
we find him, we film him, we interview him-

203
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,400
We can sell it to the tabloids
for at least a million bucks.

204
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,000
A million bucks?
We divide it four ways? What's that?

205
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,700
$250,000 would be kind of cool,
actually.

206
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,400
[ Sighs ]

207
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,400
I think our intentions
are completely out of whack.

208
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,500
I mean, what are we pursuing?
We're pursuing money.

209
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,600
You know, I could buy that gold
Trans Am I've always been after.

210
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,100
You know, the one with the-
with the eagle on the hood.

211
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,100
- I like it.
- Now let's take it for a test drive.

212
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,000
Well, my instincts say no, but, uh-

213
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,400
What does the crystal ball say, hmm?

214
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,800
Let's go to Papua New Guinea.

215
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,900
I'm in if you're in.

216
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,500
<i>First off, we're in the South Pacific.</i>
<i>This is Australia.</i>

217
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,400
This is Fiji.

218
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,400
And the island of New Guinea
has two parts:

219
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,900
- Papua New Guinea and Irian Jaya.
- Mm-hmm.

220
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,800
So one is independent,
and one is Indonesian control.

221
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,200
So we're gonna sail across
from Suva, Fiji...

222
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,700
<i>to Port Moresby,</i>
<i>which is the port of entry.</i>

223
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,100
So, from there we're gonna
drive across to the border...

224
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
to get to Irian Jaya.

225
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,900
<i>[ Colby ] Now that we're</i>
<i>going on this trip together...</i>

226
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,400
<i>we have to ask each other</i>
<i>the five questions to truth.</i>

227
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,400
- <i>Rate your relationship</i>
<i>with your parents, one to five.</i>
- Five.

228
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,800
- Three.
- One.

229
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,900
I don't consider myself
to have had parents.

230
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,400
- <i>[ Mandi ] Do you think</i>
<i>you'll achieve your goals in life?</i>
- If I make some.

231
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,100
- Yes.
- Definitely.

232
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,600
- Yeah.
- <i>[ Bijou ] On an average Sunday afternoon...</i>

233
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,600
<i>do you prefer sobriety</i>
<i>or intoxication?</i>

234
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,800
- Intoxication all the way.
- Sobriety.

235
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,600
- Sobriety.
- Intoxication.

236
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,400
<i>[ Bijou ] Have you ever had a satisfactory</i>
<i>relationship with the opposite sex?</i>

237
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,300
- Not yet.
- Yeah.

238
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,900
- Don't even try.
- No. Not even close.

239
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,900
- <i>[ Mikey ] Do you believe in God?</i>
- No.

240
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,600
No. Yes.
[ Chuckles ]

241
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,800
- Only if she's a woman.
- I believe that God is an excuse for weak people.

242
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,000
- Okay. We've got the mosquito repellant.
- <i>[ Mandi ] Check.</i>

243
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,900
- The sunscreen.
- <i>Check.</i>

244
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,900
- First aid.
- <i>Check.</i>

245
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,600
- Uh, poncho we're gonna need.
- <i>Check.</i>

246
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,100
- Where's the second camera?
- <i>Here. Take this. Take this one.</i>

<i>It's, um-</i>

- Oh. Here. Here. Here. I got it. I got it. Got it.
- <i>Okay.</i>

250
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,100
We have to have this.
We need to put it in a plastic bag.

251
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
- <i>Like waterproof it, right?</i>
- Yeah.

252

- Okay.

- Hey. Hello.
- Bijou's working on the packing.

258
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,600
- In the meantime, I've prepared a few drinks.
- <i>Oh, God.</i>

259
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,100
- That's the bigger one. That'll be mine.
- <i>We're leaving in the morning.</i>

260

- And we will leave drunk.
- So we are getting an early.

- <i>That's a brilliant game plan.</i>
- Uh-

- More than brilliant. It's the only way to travel.
- The only way.

- Okay. All right.

- <i>[ Colby ] Jesus.</i>
- What's your last name?

268
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:55,900
So, if he was taken by cannibals, I can't
understand why he hasn't been eaten yet.

269
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,500
- <i>It's in the chapter before that.</i>
- What? Where?

270
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,000
These guys-They're so isol-
They've never seen other races.

271
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:06,900
So they see a Caucasian or whatever,
they think these people are, like, sorcerers.

272

00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,800
Yeah.

567
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,100
- <i>[ Colby ] Hey. Who's got the rope?</i>
- <i>[ Mikey ] Ah. I got some...</i>

568
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,900
<i>here.</i>

569
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,500
Give me that pack.

570
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,800
- Colby, turn the camera off.
You're wasting the battery.
- <i>Chill. We've got the charger.</i>

571
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,800
Well, it's a little hard to charge
a solar-powered battery in the dark.

572
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,700
<i>[ Bijou ] It's a little hard</i>
<i>putting a tent up in the dark.</i>

573
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,100
And tomorrow we're not walking
till it's dark.

574
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,900
<i>We need to get to the creek.</i>
<i>G.P.S. says it's a quarter mile away.</i>

575
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,200
<i>You want to take a bath</i>
<i>and shave in the morning?</i>

576
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,100
All right. What do you
guys want for dinner?

577
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,600
- <i>[ Colby ] New York strip, rare.</i>
- <i>[ Mikey ] Oysters Rockefeller. No pun intended.</i>

578
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,300
- <i>[ Bijou ] Sushi.</i>
- <i>[ Mikey ] Colby, look at-Look at this.</i>

579
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,100
What is that?

580
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,100
Huh.

581
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,200
- Hi.
- Hi. [ Chuckles ]

582
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,800
- Hi. Uh, I'm Rich. This is my wife.
- Carmen. Hello.

583
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,700
[ Mikey ]
What are you guys doing here?

584
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,500
Well, our group, about a mile that way, is-
Well, we're here to spread the word.

585
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,300
Mm-hmm.

586
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,600
- <i>[ Mandi ] You're missionaries.</i>
- Yes.

587
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,000
Yeah. Exactly.

588
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,100
So our group is gonna
go across the valley highlands...

589
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:52,100
and reach some tribes that have never
really had any contact with white faces.

590
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,500
<i>Well, except for an Australian-</i>
<i>crazy Australian who trades with them.</i>

591
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,200
Who's not doing us a service,
by any means.

592
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,600
<i>Well,you know, maybe we can learn</i>
<i>something from each other.</i>

593
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,100
If you'd like, we could-
you could come to our camp.

594
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:09,300
You ever thought about maybe,
I don't know, going to a church?

595
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,200
- I don't know.
- Are you hitting on me?

596
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,900
[ Chuckles ]
Not- Not today. No.

597
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,700
You better watch your wife, buddy.

598
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,300
That's- Oh, I- I do.

599
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:23,100
- We should hang out.
- <i>Absolutely. You want to</i>
<i>come with us over there?</i>

600
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,100
- I was thinking you could stay in our tent.
- Hmm?

601
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,500
- Your tent.
- You're a good-looking guy.

602
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,600
Uh, call us when you've got it set up.

603
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,700
- Yeah.
- That'd be great.

604
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,700
- <i>Okay?</i>
- Okay.
- <i>[ Colby ] Okay, guys. Thank you.</i>

605
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,000
- Thanks.
- <i>All right. Well, I guess we're gonna take off...</i>

606
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,900
- but, please-
- Good luck. If you need anything-

607
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,100
- Anytime you want to hang out.
- We're about a mile away.

608
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,100
- <i>[ Bijou ] Don't call us. We'll call you.</i>
- Good seeing you.

609
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,100
<i>[ Rich ] That's funny.</i>
<i>Good luck with your documentary.</i>

610
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,500
- <i>[ Bijou, Colby ] Yeah.</i>
- Thank you.

611
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,400
We'll be looking forward
to seeing that. God bless.

612
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,700
- <i>Cheers.</i>
- <i>Bye.</i>

613
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,700
- Whoo!
- Hey!

614
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:59,100
Make a little toast. Looks like
Mikey already drank a little bit.

615
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,500
<i>[ Mikey ]</i>
<i>Pound it. Give it back to me then.</i>

616
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,700
- Me.
- Ah, that's good.

617
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,200
<i>[ Colby ]</i>
<i>So, the first night.</i>

618
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,300
Uh, we had quite the trials
and tribulations getting here.

619
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,500
Had shots fired. Fire in the hole.

620
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,800
- Shots fired.
- Uh, we logged about 1 5 miles today.

621
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,600
Feeling good. Get up bright
and early tomorrow.

622
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,500
[ Clicks Tongue ]
And we're on the move again.

623
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,200
- Not too early.
- <i>Hey. Pass that here, Mikey.</i>

624
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,100
Let's take it easy tomorrow.
Seriously, let's take it easy tomorrow.

625
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:34,300
- I'm not up for a full day.
- Hey, we're just getting into a groove here.

626
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,200
Yeah, I know. I know. But-
[ Sighs ]

627
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,300
<i>[ Mikey ] We're not taking</i>
<i>into account the hangover factor.</i>

628
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,100
<i>Which I definitely think</i>
<i>is pretty crucial.</i>

629
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,700
Guys, we're not having a big night.
We're gonna have a few drinks.

630
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:49,200
Then we're gonna go to bed, and we're gonna
get up and move and do it all over again.

631
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,000
<i>[ Mikey ]</i>
<i>Speak for yourself, buddy. [ Chuckles ]</i>

632
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,700
All right. I'm here repping
the Cannibal Crusaders.

633
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:13,300
Here to take- make- take a toast-
or make a toast- doesn't really matter-

634
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,100
to another fun evening.

635
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,900
[ Colby ]
All right, guys. Last night was fun.

636
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,800
<i>But, uh, we're going to bed.</i>
<i>Don't stay up too late, okay? 6.:00 a.m.</i>

637
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,300
- Yeah. We'll catch you.
- <i>[ Bijou ] Bright and bushy</i>-<i>tailed.</i>

- <i>[ Bijou Chuckles ]</i>

639
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:30,400
<i>[ Colby ] Hey. The G.P.S. says we've</i>

640

<i>The Takreet.</i>
<i>We should be there by nightfall.</i>

abuse I've administered to it
over the years.

- <i>[ Birds Chirping ]</i>
- <i>[ Insects Buzzing ]</i>

646

Oh, fuck!

<i>[ Mikey ]</i>
<i>OhI [ Chuckling ]</i>

- Oh.
- [ Groaning ]

- <i>Ouch.</i>
- [ Groans ] Goddamn it.

650
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,300
- <i>Let's see it. Let's see it.</i>
- [ Mandi Gasps ] Ouch!

651
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,700
Yeah. We finally made it
to the Takreet River.

652
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,200
- And we survived the highlands.
- We did.

653
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,200
But will we survive them?

654
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,100
[ Mikey ]
We got it. Yeah!

655
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,100
<i>[ Mandi ]</i>
<i>God, no.</i>

656

The Fuck You Gorilla Squad
has got us here.

657
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,300
- And we will hide from the cannibals.
- Will it cure my ails?

658
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,700
- <i>[ Colby ] Unbelievable.</i>
- <i>[ Mikey ] Hide from the cannibals.</i>

- Cannibals!

00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,200
All right. So here's the deal.

662
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,300
We're going on six hours
of drinking straight up.

663

[ Chuckles ]

664
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,300
And I got this creepy little hand
going under my shirt.

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,600
[ Colby ] Okay, guys. The last
two nights were great, but, uh-

669
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,800
- Hey, Daddy-O.
- We're getting up at 6:00 tomorrow.

670

- [ Chuckles ]
- So don't stay up too late, okay?

671
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,500
- A.m. or p.m.?
- Rock and roll, Colby.

672
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,800
- See, the plan is to drink-
- A.m. or p.m.?

673
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,800
[ Mandi ]
A.m., Bijou. You heard it.

674
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,800
to drink and stay up until they get up.

675
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,900
This is bullshit!

676
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,800
I'm waking them up. I don't care.

677
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,100
Mikey! Bijou!
Get the fuck out of that tent.

678
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,500
We were supposed to leave
three hours ago.

679
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,900
Get up. Sunrise was the plan.

680
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:23,200
Am I wrong? Sunrise.

681
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,600
Three hours ago.
You guys on fucking vacation?

682
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,700
We're not on vacation.
We have a plan, and we need to stick to it.

683
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,900
- Go get some more sleep.
- Can't do this every morning.

684
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,400
I don't know what you guys are here for.
It was my idea.

685
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,300
All right.
just let me have a smoke.

686
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,400
What did you just say to me?

687
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,700
Searching for Michael Rockefeller.
It was my idea.

688
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,800
- Am I wrong?
- Is that right? You are fucking wrong.

689
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,700
- Hmm?
- Yeah. We're gonna fuckin' take this up later.

690

<i>[ Bijou ] What do you reckon?</i>
<i>Do you think it's in good shape?</i>

<i>[ Mikey ] Ah, this one's</i>
<i>kind of old and brown, but...</i>

- <i>What?</i>
- Let's go.

696
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,800
<i>Fuck off. I'm looking at</i>
<i>the bamboo raft...</i>

697
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,400
<i>we should be making now and floating</i>
<i>down the river instead of walking.</i>

698
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:11,100
Mikey, we are not building a raft. Do you
guys know anything about the Takreet River?

699
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,600
- <i>Let's hear it, buddy.</i>
- Oh, you- I see you did
your research. That's good.

700
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,400
You know about the crocodiles
and the whirlpools...

701
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,900
and the waterfalls
that are around every corner.

702
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,000
But they're uncharted, so you don't know
when they're gonna come. That's the best part.

703
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:25,400
We are not building a raft.
End of story. Let's fucking go.

704
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,000
You could start with the bamboo stick
that's up his ass.

Okay. Hey, guys.

707
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:38,000
Um, let's just be adults about this,
you know?

708
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,500
We all have to get along, or we're just-
we're not gonna make it. All right?

709
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,500
Is that cool?

710
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,800
Really.

711
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,700
All right?

712
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,700
Okay. Let's move.

713
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Fuck him. I'm beating his ass.

714

- [ Bijou ] All right, babe?
- [ Mandi ] Yeah. Got it.

715
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,100
Okay.

[ Bijou ]
Cool. Cool.

Oh. Shit.

720
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:23,600
Well, it's become apparent that they
have the personality of root vegetables.

721
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,300
- Um-
- <i>[ Mikey ] They're squares.</i>

722

00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,300
- Come on!
- Let's go!

- <i>Look at these guys.</i>
- See, kids?

725
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,800
This is what happens when you
say no to booze and good times.

726
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,600
<i>Colby is on the verge</i>

- <i>I love beating rich boy ass.</i>
- What are you doing?

728
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:42,700
Your girlfriend over there wants to
roll a cigarette every five seconds.

729
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,700
She's eating our food. We're late.

730
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,900
We're five days behind schedule
because of them.

731
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,000
- They wake up late.
- <i>[ Mandi ] She's not my girlfriend.</i>

00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,300
- <i>It's Mikey instigating it anyway.</i>
<i>Fix it with Mikey.</i>
- Why did you bring her?

733
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:52,300
It's like I feel I constantly
have to justify myself to you...

734
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,800
It's like I feel I constantly
have to justify myself to you...

735
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,400
because you're always ragging on me
about smoking or drinking or...

736
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,500
<i>just being loose.</i>

737
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,500
And it's, like, it doesn't matter.
It's, like, we are the way we are.

738
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,900
Why should we justify it?

739
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,800
Why should I justify it?

740
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,300
You don't think of alcohol
as a- a crutch?

741
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,200
Um, perhaps.

742
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,600
But why is that a bad thing? I mean,
some people use money as a crutch.

743
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,200
Some people use love as a crutch.

744
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,500
Shopping. Fishing. Golfing.

745
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,700
- But it's a crutch.
- <i>And what's wrong with that?</i>

746
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,700
Why is that a bad thing?

747
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,200
We all need something
to get through fuckin' life.

We could make a lot of money
off these, honey. What do you think?

849
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:23,900
Hey. I'm Colby.

850
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,800
I think I run this outfit.

851
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:34,000
- <i>[ Bijou ] How are ya?</i>
- <i>[ Man ] What might you be</i>
<i>doing here in New Guinea?</i>

852
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,900
- <i>[ Bijou ] You're an Aussie.</i>
- <i>Yeah, mate.</i>

853
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,200
- <i>So am I.</i>
- Yeah? What are you doing up here?

854
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,700
- <i>Oh,you know,just, uh, hanging out.</i>
- Yeah?

855
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:43,100
- <i>[ Mikey ] Yep.</i>
- How about you, mate? Where are you from?

856
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,100
- U.S.
- <i>Fucking Americans.</i>

857
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:49,700
You're not the ones who've been up here fucking
around with these grave sites, are youse?

858
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,400
- Maybe.
- <i>[ Bijou ] No, mate.</i>
<i>No. We're not into that kind ofbullshit.</i>

859
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,900
Look, mate. I've known
these people for years.

860
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:58,900
I've lived here for bloody- a long time.

861
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:01,400
If they fuckin' catch you up there
fucking around, they'll kill ya.

862
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,000
- They're not gonna kill shit.
- Well, mate, I'm telling you.

863
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
If they fucking catch you,
they'll kill you.

864
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,400
They don't fuckin' muck around here.

865
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:14,800
If that's been you up there fucking around,
I'd fuck off out of here right now.

866
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,100
'Cause if they catch you,
I'm telling you, you're dead meat.

867
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,500
- <i>[ Bijou ] All right, mate.</i>
- <i>[ Mikey ] Yeah.</i>

868
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,400
- <i>[ Man ] They'll fucking have you.</i>
- Sweet.

869
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,300
- <i>[ Bijou ] Listen. Take care.</i>
- <i>Yeah. I'll take care.</i>

870
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,200
- [ Colby ] Give me the skull!
- [ Mikey Whooping ]

871
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,400
- Happy campers, the natives are getting restless.
- Give me the fucking skull!

872
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,200
- [ Mandi ] Give me the skull!
- That's my skull.

873
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,400
- Bijou, you guys are clinically- Stop this!
- Give me the fucking skull.

874
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,300
- That's my skull, baby.
- Mikey, come here!

875
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,500
- That's my skull.
- <i>Watch the booze. Watch the booze.</i>

876
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,500
- I thought we were friends.
- Sacred burial ground.

877
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,400
That's real good.
Let's take a fucking skull.

878
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,700
- Look at you guys.
- Take a fucking skull.

879
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,100
- Give me the skull!
- Give it to me!

880
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:47,500
- <i>[ Bijou ] It's a score.</i>
- First thing tomorrow we're putting it back!

881
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,400
- <i>TouchdownI</i>
- We can't put it back. It is too late.

882
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,300
- Motherf- Give me the skull!
- This is worth money!

883
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,200
- Give it to me.
- It's worth money!

884
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,100
- Bijou!
- <i>Watch the booze. Watch the booze.</i>

<i>[ Mandi ]</i>
<i>ColbyI</i>

887
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Come on. Come on.

888
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:11,100
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

889
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Whoo!

890
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:33,100
<i>[ Hurried Footsteps ]</i>

891
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:42,900
Whoo! And welcome to
the Mikey and, uh, Bijou mutiny.

892
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,200
Lame factor eliminated.

893
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,000
[ Mikey Chuckles ]

894
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,700
- Hey! [ Laughing ]
- <i>[ Laughing ]</i>

895
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,500
- Yeah, man!
- <i>Au revoir. See you later.</i>

896
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,400
- Whoo-hoo!
- [ Colby ] Come back!

897
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,700
We'll meet you.
We'll meet you up, buddy.

898
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,700
- <i>You're so cute when you're angry.</i>
- We'll meet you up.

899
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:01,100
You're lucky I didn't beat your ass
on the way out.

900
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:04,000
- We'll send you a Christmas card.
- Stay there, bro.

901
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:09,000
<i>[ Mikey ]</i>
<i>We love you. We'll catch you.</i>

902
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
How easy does it feel
without them now? Like-

903
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,300
There's this huge weight
off my shoulders.

904
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:19,200
It's as if-

905
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,300
- <i>[ Mikey ] The real question is, uh-</i>
- You shouldn't have-

906
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,300
- <i>Whoa. [ Chuckles ]</i>
- Yeah?

907
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,500
I don't think you should have shared
this whole thing with Colby.

908
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,000
I think we should have just gone
and done it ourselves.

909
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,800
You know, I don't think they wanted
to catch us, to tell you the truth.

910
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:37,400
I honestly-
I think we did them a favor...

911
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,800
because there would have been
some ass beating...

912
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,800
with another day of- of-
of conflict.

913
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,600
- <i>Well, we actually solved</i>
<i>a problem, plain and simple.</i>
- Yeah.

914
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,500
- <i>Like, we made everyone happy.</i>
- I think so.

915
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,700
And, I mean, personally,
they can rot in hell...

916
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53,100
- and we can make millions of dollars.
- <i>Maybe.</i>

917
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,600
Off Michael Rockefeller.

918
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,700
And, um, a few pilfered skulls.

919
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:03,000
- With a good sale on eBay.
- <i>[ Chuckles ]</i>

920
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,900
<i>Yeah, that was pretty lame.</i>

921
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,900
Yeah. That was tight.

922
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:13,500
And worst-case scenario,
I mean, we got to kick it...

923
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,100
in Irian Jaya.

924
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:20,100
[ Sighs ]
A guy fired an AK-47 in my face.

925
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:23,200
That's my idea of a good time.

926
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,300
I don't think I could, uh-
I could ask for a better vacation.

927
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:28,300
<i>You know,you should</i>
<i>put those glasses back on.</i>

928
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,700
<i>They make you look</i>
<i>semi</i>-<i>halfway decent cute.</i>

929
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:34,100
[ Chuckles ]

930
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,900
Keep talkin' smack.
Keep talkin' smack.

931
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:42,100
- 'Cause I'd do the same for you.
- <i>[ Chuckles ]</i>

932
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,400
You take your glasses.

933
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,100
I don't need 'em.

934
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,300
- <i>You're too tough for accessories.</i>
- Too tough.

935
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,100
You know.

936
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,400
<i>[ Mikey ]</i>
<i>There it is, baby. Shake it.</i>

937
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,200
<i>You're a rock star.</i>
<i>Put Colby's camera to use here.</i>

938
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,700
<i>Turn around a little. A little bit.</i>

939
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,900
- <i>Turn around.</i>
- Check it out. Check it out!

940
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,700
- <i>Check what out?</i>
- Look!

941
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,700
- <i>Look at what?</i>
- Shh. Shh. Shh.

942
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:19,300
<i>[ Mikey ] There's nothing over here.</i>
<i>You're always seeing shit anyway.</i>

943
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,500
- <i>It's all the drugs you did last night.</i>
- <i>Mikey,just look.</i>

944
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,500
<i>I think there's something up there.</i>
<i>just look.</i>

945
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:26,900
<i>I don't have time for this, Bijou.</i>
<i>If you want to fuck around, take the camera.</i>

946
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:29,000
- <i>Give me the camera. Shut up.</i>
- <i>Take the camera. Have fun.</i>

947
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,200
<i>I'm gonna get us ready</i>
<i>because we have stuff to do.</i>

948
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,200
<i>Mikey, I think</i>
<i>there's something up there.</i>

949
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,700
- <i>Mikey.</i>
- Bijou, we don't have time.

950
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,700
- <i>I need you here. Can you come here, please?</i>
- No, I'm not coming over there.

951
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:43,600
- <i>Babe. Mikey.</i>
- You're on drugs.

952
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,000
You are on drugs.
Get the fuck on the raft.

953
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,200
- <i>I think we're being followed.</i>
<i>Can you just come here?</i>
- Get the fuck on the raft.

954
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,700
- <i>MikeyI</i>
- Don't throw shit at me! Get on the fucking raft!

955
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,500
<i>Get over here. Get over here.</i>

956
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:02,500
How do I know
you're not gonna leave me out here?

957
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,600
<i>'Cause I would have left you</i>
<i>with Colby and Mandi if I wanted to.</i>

958
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,600
Maybe that was phase one of your plan.
Maybe there's phase two.

959
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:14,100
- <i>Oh, really?</i>
- Maybe there's ''use me to
help you get down the river''...

960
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,100
and, um-

961
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,400
I mean, you got your raft.
You've got your gun.

962

<i>[ Bijou ] I thought it was pretty lame</i>
<i>how you, uh, took that skull the other day.</i>

<i>I don't know who you</i>
<i>were trying to impress, but-</i>

966
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,500
I can deal with your mouth,
and I can deal with your aggression...

967
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,600
but I just can't deal
with your ignorance.

968

<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

<i>See that?</i>

- <i>[ Bijou ] Holy shit.</i>
- <i>What is that?</i>

972
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,400
- Mikey.
- <i>Get over here.</i>

973
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,300
<i>[ Bijou ] I fucking told you. This is what</i>
<i>I was telling you by that riverbank.</i>

974
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,200
<i>You're such a macho</i>
<i>aggressive fuck sometimes.</i>

975
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,800
<i>[ Mikey ] What's the fucking difference?</i>
<i>What's this guy got, a bow and arrow?</i>

976
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,100
<i>I got a pistol.</i>
<i>just stay-stay close to the edge.</i>

977

<i>[ Bijou ]</i>
<i>I am. I am.</i>

978
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:20,600
jesus, Mikey. I can't deal with
being followed, being watched.

979
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,600
<i>Are they aggressive?</i>

980
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,000
<i>[ Mikey ]</i>
<i>I don't know, man. Stay down.</i>

981
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,900
<i>I don't know.</i>

982
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
<i>You need to be cool. Fucking don't</i>
<i>come to me with that shit right now.</i>

983
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:35,300
<i>[ Bijou ] Is there, like,</i>
<i>a peace offering we can give them?</i>

984
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:38,000
- <i>What are you talking about?</i>
- <i>I don't know. Are some of them friendly?</i>

985
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,800
Are some of them nasty?
They can't all be fucking wack.
