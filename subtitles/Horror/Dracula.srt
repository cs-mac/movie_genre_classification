<i>The year, 1462.</i>

<i>Constantinople had fallen.</i>

3
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,540
<i>Moslem Turks swept into Europe
with a vast, superior force...</i>

4
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,580
<i>striking at Romania,
threatening all of Christendom.</i>

5
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,100
<i>From Transylvania
arose a Romanian knight...</i>

6
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,300
<i>of the Sacred Order of the Dragon,
known as Dracula.</i>

7
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,980
<i>On the eve of the battle...</i>

8
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,740
<i>his bride Elisabeta...</i>

9
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,900
<i>whom he prized
above all things on Earth...</i>

10
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,980
<i>knew that he must face
an insurmountable force...</i>

11
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,620
<i>from which he might never return.</i>

12
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,980
Elisabeta.

13
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,420
<i>The vengeful Turks
shot an arrow into the castle...</i>

14
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,660
<i>carrying false news
of Dracula's death.</i>

15
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,420
<i>Elisabeta, believing him dead...</i>

16
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,300
<i>flung herself into the river.</i>

17
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,860
<i>My prince is dead.</i>

18
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,980
<i>All is lost without him.</i>

19
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,740
<i>May God unite us in heaven.</i>

20
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,060
"Is this my reward
for defending God's church?"

21
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,540
I've done everything
that you asked, master.

22
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,500
All the preparations
are in order.

23
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,260
Everything.

24
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,980
I await your command.

25
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,660
For I know...

26
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,860
that when the rewards
are given...

27
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,420
I will be one of those
who benefits from your generosity.

28
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,300
Thank you.

29
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,580
<i>Gone mad.
Renfield is deranged.</i>

30
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,460
He's lost his greedy mind,
poor chap.

31
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,980
I want you to take over
for his foreign client...

32
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,100
this rather eccentric
Count Dracula.

33
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,300
- He's buying up property around London.
- Of course, sir.

34
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,100
I'll attend to the count.
Thank you for your confidence.

35
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,180
This is a great opportunity
for you, Harker.

36
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,300
But you'll have to leave
for Transylvania immediately.

37
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,900
Opportunities such as this
come but once in a lifetime.

38
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,260
Yes, of course, sir.

39
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,860
If I may inquire...

40
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,620
what, in fact, happened
to Mr. Renfield in Transylvania?

41
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,700
Nothing. Nothing.

42
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,660
Personal problems.

43
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,580
Close these transactions...

44
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,740
and your future with this firm
is assured.

45
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,660
Yes, sir.
I will give it my full attention.

46
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,060
We've waited this long,
haven't we?

47
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,300
We can be married when I return.

48
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,580
Of course.

49
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,940
I'll write.

50
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,580
Jonathan.

51
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,900
Jonathan, I love you.

52
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,820
I love you, Mina.

We're early, driver.
No one is here.

78
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,740
I say, is the castle far?

79
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,980
Welcome to my home.

80
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,140
Enter freely of your own will...

81
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,060

the happiness you bring.

82
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,980
Count Dracula?

83
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,900
I am...

84
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,940
Dracula.

85
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,660
And I bid you welcome,
Mr. Harker, to my house.

86
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,980
Come in.

87
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,860
You will, I trust,
excuse me that I...

88
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,100
do not join you.

89
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,420
But I have already dined.

90
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,060
And I never drink...

91
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,460
wine.

92
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,380
An ancestor?
I see a resemblance.

93
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,180
The Order of the Dracul.

94
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,620
The Dragon.

95
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,060
An ancient society...

96
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,700
pledging my forefathers...

97
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,740
to defend their church
against all enemies of Christ.

98
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,500
That relationship
was not entirely...

99
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,900
successful.

100
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,660
Oh, yes.

101
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,300
It is no laughing matter.

102
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,820
We Draculs
have a right to be proud.

103
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,780
What devil or witch
was ever so great as Attila...

104
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,060
whose blood flows
in these veins?

105
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,260
Blood...

106
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,820
is too precious a thing
in these times.

107
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:37,100
The warlike days are over.

108
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,180
The victories of my great race...

109
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,900
are but a tale to be told.

110
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,660
I am the last of my kind.

111
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,180
I have offended you
with my ignorance, Count.

112
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,660
Forgive me.

113
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,740
I do so long to go
through the crowded streets...

114
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,020
of your mighty land...

115
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,700
to be in the midst of the whirl
and the rush of humanity...

116
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,060
to share its life...

117
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,140
its changes, its death.

118
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,500
There.
You, Count, are--

119
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,420
are the owner of
Carfax Abbey at Purfleet.

120
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,700
Congratulations.

121
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,460
Your firm writes most highly...

122
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,940
of your talents.

123
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:45,740
They say you are a man of good...

124
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,260
taste.

125
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,580
And that you are
a worthy substitute...

126
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:56,340
"Society Of Solicitors - R.M. Renfield"
to your predecessor, Mr. Renfield.

127
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,020
You may rely on me, Count.

128
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,780
Forgive my curiosity,
but why ten houses...

129
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,020
in such precise locations
around London?

130
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,140
Is it to raise the market value?

131
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,180
Do you believe in destiny?

132
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,460
That even the powers of time...

133
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,660
can be altered
for a single purpose?

134
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,020
The luckiest man
who walks on this Earth...

135
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,180
is the one who finds...

136
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,500
true love.

137
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,260
You found Mina.

138
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,660
I thought she was lost.

139
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,860
We're to be married
as soon as I return.

140
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,940
Are you married, Count?

141
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,340
Sir...

142
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,260
are you married?

143
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,420
I was married once.

144
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,620
Ages ago, it seems.

145
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,700
She died.

146
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,380
I'm very sorry.

147
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,300
She was fortunate.

148
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:15,180
My life, at its best, is misery.

149
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,460
She will no doubt
make a devoted wife.

150
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,220
And you a faithful husband.

151
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,180
Come.

152
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,820
Write now, my friend,

153

and say that it shall please you...

154

155

156
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,820
A month?

157
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,980
Do you wish me to stay so long?

158
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,380
I will take no refusal.

00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,220
<i>and she has never minded
that I am only a schoolmistress.</i>

165
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,180
How disgustingly awful.

166
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,300
Mina!

167
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,700
Oh, Mina, you're always working.

168
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,940
Is your ambitious Jon Harker...

169
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,580
forcing you to learn
that ridiculous machine?

170
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,900
When he could be forcing you
to perform...

171
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:05,020
unspeakable acts of desperate passion
on the parlor floor.

172
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,660
Lucy, really.

173
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,540
You shouldn't talk about
my fiancé in such a way.

174
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,940
There's more to marriage
than carnal pleasure.

175
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,900
Oh, Mina.
So I see.

176
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,300
Much, much more.

177
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,180
That's--

178
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,940
What is it, Lucy?

179
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,380
Because I don't understand it.

180
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,180
Can a man and woman really do...

181
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,140
that?

182
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,700
I did, only last night.

183
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,420
- Fibber. You did not.
- Yes, I did.

184
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:44,540
Well, in my dreams.

185
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,420
Jonathan measures up,
doesn't he?

186
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,340
You can tell Lucy.

187
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,820
We've kissed. That's all.

188
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,540
He thinks he's too poor
to marry me.

189
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,260
And it's all the worse now that
I'm here visiting you at Hillingham...

190
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,940
my rich friend.

191
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:05,420
Yes, but not even
one marriage proposal.

192
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,820
And here I am, almost 20...

193
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,060
practically a hag.

194
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,420
Mr. Quincey P. Morris.

195
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,340
- Oh, look.
- What is that?

196
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,620
A Texan.

197
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,740
Quincey P. Morris.

198
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:30,580
He's so young and fresh...

199
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,820
like a wild stallion
between my legs.

200
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,860
You're positively indecent.

201
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,420
I just know what men desire.

202
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,140
Watch.

203
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,700
- Quincey, darling.
- Miss Lucy.

204
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,620
Why, you're as fresh
as the spring rain.

205
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,580
Oh, thank you.

206
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,820
Please let me touch it.

207
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,700
It's so big.

208
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,140
Little girl.

209
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,300
Oh, my dear,
sweet little girl.

210
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,500
I hold your hand...

211
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,740
- and you've kissed me.
- Jack!

212
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,460
Oceans of love--
Oh, Jack, my darling.

213
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,180
Poor little baby.

214
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,140
My kitten, come over here.

215
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,380
Come over here
and I'll kiss it better.

216
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,660
My poor little blossom.

217
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,780
My poor little doctor.
Brilliant doctor.

218
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,740
- Hello, Quincey.
- Jack.

219
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,060
What a naughty bear.
Let me--

220
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,180
- Arthur Holmwood, Esquire.
- Arthur!

221
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,220
Oh, my darling.

222
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,700
Oh, you look wonderful.

223
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,540
I'm so sorry about your hat.

224
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,460
- Charming.
- It's my snake dress.

225
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,860
Is it really?

226
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,620
<i>Lucy is a pure
and virtuous girl...</i>

227
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,620
<i>but I admit that her free way
of speaking shocks me sometimes.</i>

228
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,660
<i>Jonathan says it is a defect
of the aristocracy...</i>

229
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,980
<i>that they say what they please.</i>

230
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:01,020
<i>The truth is that I admire Lucy, and I'm
not surprised that men flock around her.</i>

231
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,900
<i>I wish I were as pretty
and as adored as she.</i>

232
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,420
R.M. Renfield,
successful solicitor...

233
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,140
respected member of
the Lord Nugent's Windem Club...

234
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:36,500
returns from business abroad
in Transylvania...

235
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,500
promptly suffers
a complete mental breakdown.

236
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,740
<i>He's now obsessed
with some blood lust.</i>

237
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,180
George.

238
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,300
Wait here.

239
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,220
Would you care for
an hors d'oeuvre, Dr. Seward...

240
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,940
or a canapé?

241
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,420
No, thank you, Mr. Renfield.
How are you feeling tonight?

242
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:12,060
Far better than you,
my lovesick doctor.

243
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,980
Is my personal life
of interest to you?

244
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,860
Of course it is.
All life interests me.

245
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,820
Your diet, Mr. Renfield,
is disgusting.

246
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:24,220
Actually,
they're perfectly nutritious.

247
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,060
You see,
each life that I ingest...

248
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,260
gives back life to me.

249
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,540
A fly gives you life?

250
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,380
Certainly.

251
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:41,380
But you might as well ask a man to eat
molecules with a pair of chopsticks...

252
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,140
than to interest me
in a lesser carnivore.

253
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,660
I shall have to invent a new
classification of lunatic for you.

254
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:52,820
What about spiders?
Spiders eat the flies.

255
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,420
Yes, spiders eat them.

256
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,820
What about sparrows?

257
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,140
Oh, yes.
Did you say sparrows?

258
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:06,220
- Something larger, perhaps?
- Oh, yes.

259
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,620
A kitten.

260
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,300
I beg you.

261
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,260
A little, sleek--
a playful kitten.

262
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,580
Something I can teach.
Something I can feed.

263
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,540
No one would refuse me a kitten.

264
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,820
Wouldn't you prefer a cat?

265
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,540
Oh, yes.

266
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,660
A big cat.

267
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,620
- My salvation depends upon it!
- Your salvation?

268
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,700
Yes. I need lives.

269
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:35,900
- I need lives for the master.
- What master?

270
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,820
The master will come...

271
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,900
and he has promised
to make me immortal.

272
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,460
How?

273
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,620
Get him off!

274
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,180
The blood is the life!

275
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,220
<i>The blood is the life!</i>

276
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,500
<i>30th May, Castle Dracula.</i>

277
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:04,820
<i>I think strange things which
I dare not confess to my own soul.</i>

278
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,220
<i>The count...</i>

279
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,660
<i>the way he looked at Mina's picture
fills me with dread...</i>

280
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,540
<i>as if I have a part to play
in a story that is not known to me.</i>

281
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,700
I didn't hear you come in.

282
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:44,020
Take care how you cut yourself.

283
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,380
It is more dangerous
than you think.

284
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:58,340
A foul bauble of man's vanity.

285
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,700
Perhaps you should...

286
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,860
grow a beard.

287
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,860
The letters I requested.

288
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,100
Have you written them?

289
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,420
Good.

290
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:44,420
Should you leave these rooms...

291
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,940
you will not, by any chance...

292
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:51,180
go to sleep in any other
part of the castle.

293
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,940
It is old...

294
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,900
and has many bad memories.

295
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:04,340
- Be warned.
- I'm sure I understand.

296
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:16,420
Do not put your faith
in such trinkets of deceit.

297
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,700
We are in Transylvania.

298
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,580
Transylvania is not England.

299
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:28,780
Our ways are not your ways.

300
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,860
And to you...

301
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:34,140
there shall be
many strange things.

302
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,420
I've seen many
strange things already.

303
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,620
Bloody wolves chasing me
through some blue inferno!

304
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,500
Listen to them.

305
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,580
The children of the night.

306
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,780
What sweet music they make.

307
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,780
Music? Those animals?

308
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:39,660
<i>I did as Dracula instructed.
I wrote three letters.</i>

309
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,100
<i>To the firm, to my family
and to my beloved Mina.</i>

310
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,020
<i>I said nothing of my fears
as he will read them, no doubt.</i>

311
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,540
<i>I know now that I am a prisoner.</i>

312
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,100
<i>Jonathan.</i>

313
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,540
<i>Jonathan, come to me.</i>

314
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,540
<i>Come.</i>

315
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,940
<i>Lay down.</i>

316
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,140
<i>Lay back into my arms.</i>

317
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,660
<i>Lay back, Jonathan.</i>

318
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,020
<i>"Dearest Mina,
all is well here.</i>

319
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,900
<i>The count has insisted
I remain for a month...</i>

320
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,220
<i>to tutor him in English custom.</i>

321
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,580
<i>I can say no more,
except I love you.</i>

322
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:28,300
<i>Ever faithful, Jonathan."</i>

323
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:35,020
<i>The letters I have written
have undoubtedly sealed my doom.</i>

324
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,460
<i>The count's gypsies--</i>

<i>They are to be delivered to his
newly acquired Carfax Abbey in London.</i>

329
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:05,260
<i>Why do they
fill these boxes with earth?</i>

330
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,740
I love him! I love him!

331
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,580
It's so wonderful.
I've decided.

332
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,100
I love him
and I've said yes.

333
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:24,580
Finally. Don't tell me.
The Texan with the big knife?

334
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,460
Oh, no.
To my dear number three.

335
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:31,380
Lord Arthur Holmwood.
Lord and Lady Holmwood.

336
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:34,180
You are to be my maid of honor.
Oh, say yes.

337
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:38,340
Mina, what is it?
It's the most exciting day of my life.

338
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,860
You don't seem to care.

339
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,940
It's just that I'm
so terribly worried about Jonathan.

340
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,180
This letter I received is so--

341
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:50,580
It's so cold. It's so unnatural.
It's not like him at all.

342
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,500
Mina, don't worry.

343

<i>Captain's log: the Demeter.</i>

344

<i>We picked up 50 boxes

The master of all life is at hand!

355
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,540
Gather round!

356
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,060
I am here to do
your bidding, master!

357
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,460
I have worshipped you
long and far off!

358
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:54,900
And now you are near, master!

359
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,580
I am your slave!

360
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:00,220
I await your command!

361
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,020
The case of Renfield
grows more interesting.

Yet, there is method in his madness
with his flies and spiders.

363
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,020
Had I the secret of even
one such brilliant mind...

364
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:13,780
the key to the fancy
of one lunatic--

365
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:20,900
Lucy.

366
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,260
Lucy? Lucy!

367
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:59,060
No. Do not see me.

368
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:16,940
Oh! I couldn't control myself.

369
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:20,780
Hush, Lucy. You're dreaming.
You're walking in your sleep again.

370
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:24,780
My soul,
it seemed to leave my body.

371
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:29,420
There was this agonizing feeling,
and I couldn't get back to it.

372
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,900
I'm absolutely shaking.

373
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,860
It's all right.
You were dreaming.

374
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:36,140
I had to. It sort of
pulled me and lured me.

375
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:39,260
- I had no control.
- It's all right.

376
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:42,220
- It had red eyes.
- Hush now.

377
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,220
I still have the taste
of his blood in my mouth.

378
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,980
Here we go.
Swing it round here.

379
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,300
Master.

380
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:12,220
Master! I am here!

381
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,820
I have worshipped you.

382
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,420
<i>Contrary to some beliefs,

<i>though it is not his natural time,
and his powers are weak.</i>

385
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:48,620
See the amazing cinematograph!

386
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,620
A wonder of modern civilization!

387
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,900
The latest sensation!

388
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,940
The greatest attraction
of the century!

389
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,700
The new wonder of the world!

390
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,900
See me.

391
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:27,860
See me now.

392
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,460
Escaped wolf from zoo
still at large!

393
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,380
Buy a paper, sir?

394
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,060
Thank you, sir.

395
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:48,820
<i>Get your Gazette!
Penny a paper!</i>

396
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,940
My humblest apologies.

397
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,940
Forgive my ignorance.

398
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,980
I am recently arrived
from abroad...

399
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:14,020
and I do not know your city.

400
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:17,860
- Is a beautiful lady--
- A street atlas is sixpence. Good day.

401
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:22,500
I have offended you.

402
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:26,220
I am only looking for
the cinematograph.

403
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:29,700
I understand it is a wonder
of the civilized world.

404
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:33,420
If you seek culture,
then visit a museum.

405
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:36,300
London is filled with them.
Excuse me.

406
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:47,820
A woman so lovely and intelligent...

407
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:51,380
should not be walking the streets
of London without her gentleman.

408
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,620
Do I know you, sir?

409
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:57,620
Are you acquainted
with my husband?

410
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:59,540
Shall I call the police?

411
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,420
Husband?

412
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,860
I shall bother you no more.

413
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:10,980
Sir.

414
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,660
It is I who have been rude.

415
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:17,420
- If you're looking--
- Please.

416
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,180
Permit me to introduce myself.

417
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:28,020
I am Prince Vlad of Sagite.

418
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,820
- A prince, no less?
- I am...

419
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,220
your servant.

420
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:40,900
Wilhelmina Murray.

421
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,340
I am...

422
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:48,420
honored...

423
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,340
Madam Mina.

424
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:55,820
This way.

425
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:10,380
Hello, sir.

426
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:13,700
Mr. Holmwood asked me
to stop by to see Miss Lucy.

427
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:15,220
Yes, sir.

428
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,940
- Dr. Seward, Miss Lucy.
- Thank you.

429
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,620
Oh, Jack!

430
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,820
Brilliant Jack.
Do you like it?

431
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,500
Did Arthur put you up to this...

432
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:29,820
or did you want me alone just once
before I'm married?

433
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:33,300
Lucy, you're embarrassing me.

434
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:36,060
I'm here as your doctor.

435
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:38,300
Your fiancé
is very worried about you...

436
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:43,060
and I assure you,
a doctor's confidence is sacred.

437
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:45,180
I must have your complete trust.

438
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:51,500
Help me, Jack.

439
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:55,500
I don't know
what's happening to me.

440
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,660
I'm changing.

441
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:59,580
I can feel it.

442
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:02,900
I can hear everything.

443
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:05,940
I hear the servants at the other
end of the house, whispering.

444
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:09,180
I hear mice in the attic,
stomping like elephants.

445
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,860
But I'm having horrible
nightmares, Jack.

446
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,420
The eyes.

447
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,860
Oh, Jack.

448
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:21,460
I'm here, Lucy.
Nothing will harm you.

449
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:25,700
Let it work.

450
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:29,820
- Thank you.
- Lucy.

451
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:32,220
Oh, Jack, kiss me.

452
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,940
And may I say, Miss Lucy
is hotter than a June bride...

453
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:42,340
ridin' bareback
buck naked in the Sahara.

454
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:44,980
I would watch my colonial tongue
if I were you.

455
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:49,900
Hello, Jack.
And how's our lovely patient today?

456
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:53,620
Well, frankly, Arthur,
I'm confounded.

457
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,300
Jack, are you still
broodin' over Miss Lucy?

458
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:59,820
I can only conclude
it must be something mental.

459
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:03,260
How very droll.
Did you hear that, Quince?

460
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:06,780
Last week he wanted to marry her,
and now he wants to have her committed.

461
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:09,500
Let's have a look at her.

462
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:22,740
I'm at a loss, I admit.

463
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:25,420
I've taken the liberty
of cabling Abraham Van Helsing...

464
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,420
the metaphysician/philosopher.

465
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,260
Sounds like a goddamn
witch doctor to me, Jack.

466
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:34,060
Van Helsing knows more about obscure
diseases than any man in the world.

467
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:36,260
He's my teacher and mentor.

468
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:42,460
Do it, man.
Bring him here.

469
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:44,420
Spare no expense.

470
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:19,500
Astounding.

471
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,260
There are no limits to science.

472
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,580
How can you call this science?

473
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,820
Do you think Madam Curie
would invite such comparisons?

474
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,460
Really.

475
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:38,660
I shouldn't have come here.

476
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:40,620
I must go.

477
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:47,500
Do not fear me.

478
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:03,660
Stop this.

479
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:05,260
Stop this.

480
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,740
My God. Who are you?

481
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:19,500
I know you.

482
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:24,020
I have crossed oceans of time...

483
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,940
to find you.

484
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:05,420
There is no need to panic.

485
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:09,060
The animal handlers have
everything under complete control.

486
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,220
Come here, Mina.

487
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,220
He likes you.

488
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:18,540
There is much to be learned
from beasts.

489
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:15,620
"A dear friend near death;

490
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:18,500
disease of the blood
unknown to all medical theory.

491
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:21,340
I am in desperate need.
Jack Seward."

492
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:30,860
The tropical pampas vampire bat
must...

493
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:34,540
consume ten times its own weight
in fresh blood each day...

494
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:38,020
or its own blood cells will die.

495
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:48,660
<i>Cute little vermin, ja?</i>

496
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:52,300
Blood and the diseases
of the blood...

497
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:55,060
such as syphilis,
they concern us here.

498
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,340
The very name
"venereal diseases"...

499
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:01,980
the diseases of Venus,
imputes to them divine origin.

500
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:05,380
And they are involved
in that sex problem about which...

501
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:09,420
the ethics and ideals
of Christian civilization are concerned.

502
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:14,380
In fact, civilization and syphilization
have advanced together.

503
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:20,020
- What is this?
- It's from the telegraph, Professor.

504
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,940
Telegraph?

505
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:28,020
Thank you. Gentlemen, thank you.
That will be all.

506
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,540
<i>Dawn.</i>

507
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:43,420
<i>These may be the last words
I write in this journal.</i>

508
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,100
<i>Dracula has left me
with these women...</i>

509
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:48,220
<i>these devils of the pit.</i>

510
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,460
<i>They drain my blood
to keep me weak...</i>

511
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:53,220
<i>barely alive so I cannot escape.</i>

512
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:56,580
<i>I will try one last time today
to escape to the water.</i>

513
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:59,460
<i>There must be passageway
to the river...</i>

514
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:01,900
<i>and then away
from this cursed land...</i>

515
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:05,060
<i>where the devil and his children
still walk with earthly feet.</i>

516
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:16,980
<i>For the record, I do attest...</i>

517
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:20,220
<i>that at this point,
I, Abraham Van Helsing...</i>

518
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:24,060
<i>became personally involved
in these strange events.</i>

519
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:18,740
Professor Van Helsing,
how good of you to come.

520
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:26,420
I always come to my friends in need
when they call me.

521
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,900
So, Jack, tell me everything
about your case.

522
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:31,820
She has all the usual
physical anemic signs.

523
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:34,980
Her blood analyzes normal,
and yet it is not.

524
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:38,500
She manifests continued blood loss.
I cannot trace the cause.

525
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:40,460
Blood loss? How?

526
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:50,700
My God, close the doors!

527
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:02,900
My God...

528
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:05,020
she's only a child.

529
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:07,980
<i>Ja.</i>

530
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,140
My God.

531
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:15,140
There's no time to lose.
There must be a transfusion at once.

532
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:17,820
Take off your coat.
Remember how to tie a tourniquet?

533
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:20,260
- Or have you forgotten?
- You perfected a procedure?

534
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,700
Perfected? No.
I've only experimented.

535
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:24,620
Landsteiner's method.

536
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:28,500
Animals, goats, sheeps.

537
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:31,980
If hemolysis occurs
in the blood donor serum...

538
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:33,740
her red blood cells will explode.

539
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:36,060
She will die.
Take this tube.

540
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,940
What in God's name
is going on up here?

541
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:43,860
This is Professor Van Helsing, Art.

542
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:46,340
- What the hell is he doing to Lucy?
- He's trying to save her life.

543
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:48,860
- Good God!
- You're the fiancé? Please.

544
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:55,140
Take off your coat.
This young lady's very ill. She's dying.

545
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:57,220
She wants blood
and blood she must have.

546
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,700
Take off your coat.

547
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:00,620
Roll up your sleeve, Art.

548
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:04,180
- Oh, God.
- Quickly, quickly.

549
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:05,820
Roll it up!

550
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:07,620
This may hurt a little, Art.

551
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:22,300
Forgive me. My life is hers. I would
give my last drop of blood to save her.

552
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:24,260
Your last drop?

553
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:25,980
Thank you.

554
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:30,340
You are very welcome here.
I don't ask as much as that. Not yet.

555
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:31,780
Hold her hand.

556
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:48,060
Jack, that poor creature has had the
blood of two men put into her already.

557
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:51,460
Man alive. Her whole body
couldn't hold that much blood.

558
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:57,620
- What took it out?
- That's a good question, Mr. Morris.

559
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:04,900
Those marks on her throat--

560
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:07,340
no disease, no trituration--

561
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:09,260
I am sure the blood loss
occurred there.

562
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:11,180
Oh? Where did the blood go?

563
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:14,900
You were once
a careful student, Jack.

564
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:16,820
Use your brain!
Where did the blood go?

565
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,260
Tell me!

566
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:21,540
- The bed would be covered in blood.
- Exactly.

567
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:23,980
You do not let your eyes see
nor your ears hear...

568
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,340
that which you cannot account for.

569
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:30,260
Something just went up there,
sucked it out of her and flew away?

570
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:33,500
<i>Ja. Why not?</i>

571
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:37,740
That's brilliant.
That's absolutely brilliant.

572
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:39,900
Will one of you learned doctors--
or whatever you are--

573
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:41,860
kindly tell me
what is going on with my Lucy?

574
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:45,740
Jack, you are a scientist.

575
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:49,100
Do you not think there are things in
this universe you cannot understand...

576
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:51,620
and which are true--
mesmerism, hypnotism?

577
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:53,780
You and Charcot
have proved hypnotism.

578
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:55,260
Materialization, astral bodies.

579
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:06,500
Professor?

580
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:09,220
Where did he go?

581
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:14,100
You see?

582
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:16,540
I feel like a blundering novice.

583
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:20,100
Gentlemen, we're not fighting
some disease here.

584
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:22,180
Those marks on your dear
Miss Lucy's neck were made...

585
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:24,380
by something unspeakable
out there.

586
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:25,660
Dead, but not dead.

587
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:28,780
It stalks us for some dread purpose
I do not comprehend.

588
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:31,860
To live, it feeds
on Lucy's precious blood.

589
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:34,300
It is a beast, a monster.

590
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:55,220
<i>What is happening
to Lucy and to me?</i>

591
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:58,420
<i>When I was younger,
my feelings were never troubled.</i>

592
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,780
<i>I wish I were myself again...</i>

593
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:04,460
<i>the sensible Mina
I always depended on.</i>

594
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:12,660
<i>Absinthe...</i>

595
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:15,140
<i>is the aphrodisiac of the self.</i>

596
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:19,420
<i>The green fairy...</i>

597
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:24,140
<i>who lives in the absinthe...</i>

598
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,060
<i>wants your soul.</i>

599
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:30,100
<i>But...</i>

600
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:34,260
<i>you are safe with me.</i>

601
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:50,660
Tell me, Prince...

602
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,740
tell me of your home.

603
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:57,420
The most beautiful place...

604
01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:59,340
in all creation.

605
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:03,820
Yes, it must be.

606
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:11,340
A land beyond
a great, vast forest...

607
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:16,460
surrounded by
majestic mountains...

608
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:20,100
lush vineyards...

609
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:26,420
and flowers of such frailty
and beauty...

610
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,820
as to be found nowhere else.

611
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:40,140
You've described my home...

612
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:42,340
as if you had seen it firsthand.

613
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:49,260
It's your voice, perhaps.

614
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:51,180
It's so familiar.

615
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:54,980
It's like--

616
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:58,980
It's like a voice in a dream
I cannot place...

617
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:04,300
and it comforts me.

618
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:06,780
- When I am alone.
- When you are alone.

619
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:29,780
And what of the princess?

620
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:37,860
Princess?

621
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:39,780
There is always a princess...

622
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:44,180
with gowns flowing white.

623
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:51,220
And her face.

624
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:54,260
Oh, God...

625
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:56,180
her face...

626
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:01,300
is a river.

627
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:08,260
The princess...

628
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:12,660
she's a river
filled with tears of sadness...

629
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:15,940
and heartbreak.

630
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:21,900
There was a princess.

631
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:27,140
Elisabeta.

632
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:31,540
She was the most radiant woman...

633
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:33,620
in all the empires of the world.

634
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:44,340
Man's deceit took her
from her ancient prince.

635
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:49,140
She leapt to her death...

636
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:51,540
into the river that you spoke of.

637
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:55,380
In my mother's tongue...

638
01:04:56,780 --> 01:04:58,660
it is called...

639
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:01,860
<i>argesh.</i>

640
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:05,700
River princess.

641
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:39,500
<i>Dear Madam.</i>

642
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:42,700
<i>"Sister Agatha's Letter - 12th August"

is in extreme danger...</i>

645
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:54,020
<i>and he desires with all urgency
that you join him here...</i>

646
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:57,140
<i>so that you may
immediately be married.</i>

647
01:06:57,220 --> 01:07:00,740
<i>Yours with all blessings,
Sister Agatha.</i>

648
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:05,900
My sweet prince.

649
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:08,500
Jonathan must never know of us.

650
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:20,460
Dr. Van Helsing.

651
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:23,620
<i>And you're Madam Mina,
dear friend to our Lucy, ja?</i>

652
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:26,820
- How is she, doctor?
- She's still very weak.

653
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:29,100
She tells me of your
beloved Jonathan Harker...

654
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:31,300
and your worry for him.

655
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:33,460
Well, I, too, worry
for all young lovers.

656
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:40,340
There are darknesses in life,
my child...

657
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:42,500
and there are lights.

658
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:45,300
You are one of the lights,
dear Mina...

659
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:47,380
the light of all light.

660
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:54,300
Go now.
See your friend.

661
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:17,180
You look different.

662
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:20,300
You look positively radiant.

663
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:21,860
You heard from Jonathan.

664
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:24,020
- Didn't you?
- Yes.

665
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:27,620
He's safe.

666
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:30,340
He's in a convent in Romania.

667
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:33,740
He's suffering
from a violent brain fever.

668
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:35,500
The good sisters
are caring for him.

669
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:40,060
They wrote to me,
and they say he needs me...

670
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:43,140
but I won't go.

671
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:45,380
I'm not going to leave you.

672
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:50,020
You've got to go to him...

673
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:52,580
and you've got to love him...

674
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:54,740
and marry him
right then and there.

675
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:59,700
And I want you to take this,
my sister.

676
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:01,660
It's my wedding gift to you.

677
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:05,940
Don't worry about
spoiled little Lucy.

678
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:10,580
I'll be all right.

679
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:13,540
Tell Jonathan oceans of love.

680
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:29,580
Jack, how is she?

681
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:50,580
This is why I cannot breathe!

682
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:52,580
Lucy, it's medicinal.

683
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:54,900
To help you sleep.
To dream better dreams.

684
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:57,940
It's garlic!
It's nothing but common garlic!

685
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:01,220
Quincey's here to see you.
Get some brandy.

686
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:04,900
Now, Miss Lucy,
you just rest easy.

687
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:06,740
Arthur sent me
to take care of you.

688
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:09,260
He said
if you don't get better quick...

689
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:12,260
I have to put you out of your misery
like a lame horse.

690
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:17,460
You're such a beast.

691
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:22,500
Will you kiss me?

692
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:27,780
Kiss me.

693
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:38,780
- That old coot!
- Get off me!

694
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:42,140
Listen to me!
Sleep, sleep now. Sleep.

695
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:47,100
You're at peace.

696
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:50,860
Look. There. There.

697
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:55,580
<i>Nosferatu.</i>

698
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:11,460
"Here occurs the shocking
and frightening history...

699
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:15,380
of the wild,
berserk Prince Dracula--

700
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:17,700
How he impaled people
and roasted them...

701
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:19,340
boiled their heads in a kettle...

702
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:21,700
how he skinned them alive...

703
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:25,260
and hacked them to pieces
and then drank their blood."

704
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:31,700
Dracul.

705
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:34,220
For blood is the life.

706
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:52,620
<i>"My dearest Prince, forgive me.</i>

707
01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:56,140
<i>I have received word
from my fiancé in Romania.</i>

708
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:59,340
<i>I am en route to join him.
We are to be married.</i>

709
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:02,780
<i>I will never see you again.</i>

710
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,540
<i>Mina."</i>

711
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:16,100
<i>It is odd,
but I feel almost...</i>

712
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:18,740
<i>that my strange friend
is with me.</i>

713
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:21,620
<i>He speaks to me in my thoughts.</i>

714
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:24,700
<i>With him I felt more alive
than ever I had.</i>

715
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:27,620
<i>And now without him,
soon to be a bride...</i>

716
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:30,380
<i>I feel confused and lost.</i>

717
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:34,340
<i>Perhaps, though I try to be good,
I am bad.</i>

718
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:37,300
<i>Perhaps I am a bad,
inconstant woman.</i>

719
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:56,940
Winds!

720
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:09,540
It is the cause.

721
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:12,260
It is the cause of my soul!

722
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:13,740
It is Dracula...

723
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:15,900
the undead...

724
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:18,900
the foe I have pursued
all my life.

725
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:24,580
Dracula!

726
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:29,380
Jack, hurry!
I have much to tell you.

727
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:33,860
Guard her well, Mr. Morris.

728
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:36,300
Do not fail here tonight.

729
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:39,300
We are dealing with forces
beyond all human experience...

730
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:41,380
an enormous power,
so guard her well.

731
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:44,980
Otherwise your precious Lucy
will become a bitch of the devil...

732
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:46,900
a whore of darkness!

733
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:50,260
You're a sick old buzzard.

734
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:53,660
Hear me out, young man.

735
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:56,100
Lucy is not a random victim
attacked by mere accident.

736
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:57,780
Do you understand? No.

737
01:13:57,860 --> 01:14:01,900
She is a willing recruit,
a breathless, wanton follower.

738
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:04,420
I dare say, a devoted disciple.

739
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:06,900
She is the devil's concubine!

740
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:09,820
Do you understand me?

741
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:14,540
Yet, we may still save
her precious soul.

742
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:18,220
But not on an empty stomach.

743
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:20,500
- Jack!
- Here, sir.

744
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:23,220
I starve. Feed me.

745
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:25,700
You old coot!

746
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:38,340
Your impotent men
with their foolish spells...

747
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:42,340
cannot protect you
from my power.

748
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:57,660
I condemn you to living death...

749
01:16:57,740 --> 01:17:00,820
to eternal hunger...

750
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:05,020
for living blood.

751
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:38,580
I know how deeply you loved her. That
is why you must trust me and believe.

752
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:40,780
Believe?
How can I believe?

753
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:44,500
I want you to bring me, before
nightfall, a set of postmortem knives.

754
01:18:44,580 --> 01:18:46,580
An autopsy? Lucy?

755
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:50,100
No, not exactly. I just want to cut off
her head and take out her heart.

756
01:18:57,740 --> 01:19:00,580
<i>Diary, 17th September.</i>

757
01:19:00,620 --> 01:19:04,180
<i>Poor Jonathan.
He's still so ill.</i>

758
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:07,460
<i>He's cheered by
the familiar streets in London.</i>

759
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:11,540
<i>For me, now that Lucy is dead,
it is a sad homecoming.</i>

760
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:15,140
<i>It is as if a part of me
is dead too...</i>

761
01:19:15,180 --> 01:19:17,940
<i>except for the tiny hope
that lives in me...</i>

762
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:20,460
<i>that I will again
see my prince.</i>

763
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:22,420
<i>Is he here?</i>

764
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:24,020
<i>Now that I am married...</i>

765
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:28,100
<i>I begin to understand the nature
of my feelings for my strange friend...</i>

766
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:30,500
<i>who is always in my thoughts.</i>

767
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:43,140
Jonathan, what is it?

768
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:45,100
It is the man himself.

769
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:47,260
Look, he's grown young.

770
01:20:29,060 --> 01:20:33,380
Gentlemen, must we desecrate
poor Lucy's grave?

771
01:20:33,460 --> 01:20:35,340
She died horribly enough.

772
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:40,900
If Miss Lucy is dead,
then no wrong can be done to her.

773
01:20:40,940 --> 01:20:43,460
But if she's not dead--

774
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:45,940
What are you saying, man?
That she's been buried alive?

775
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:50,900
No. All I say is
she is undead.

776
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:53,100
Undead.

777
01:20:53,180 --> 01:20:54,940
This is insane.

778
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:15,540
Gentlemen, shall we?

779
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:18,500
One, two, three.

780
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:36,500
Where is she?

781
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:43,620
What have you done with her?

782
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:45,780
She lives beyond
the grace of God...

783
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:48,020
a wanderer in the outer darkness.

784
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:51,940
<i>She is vampyre, nosferatu.</i>

785
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:54,900
These creatures do not die
like the bee after the first sting...

786
01:21:54,980 --> 01:21:57,300
but instead grow strong
and become immortal...

787
01:21:57,380 --> 01:21:59,420
<i>once infected
by another nosferatu.</i>

788
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:07,540
So my friends,
we fight not one beast...

789
01:22:07,620 --> 01:22:10,940
but legions that go on
age after age after age...

790
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:12,980
feeding on the blood
of the living.

791
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:21,340
Quickly, hide. Now.

792
01:22:56,780 --> 01:22:59,860
Come to me, Arthur.

793
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:02,900
Leave these others
and come to me.

794
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:07,780
My arms are hungry for you,
my darling.

795
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:11,300
Kiss me and caress me...

796
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:13,700
my darling husband, please.

797
01:23:13,740 --> 01:23:16,380
We wave Christ
and His holy blood!

798
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:18,980
We are strong in the Lord
and the power of His might!

799
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:25,260
The power of God is upon us!

800
01:23:36,780 --> 01:23:39,380
I bring you from shadow
into light!

801
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:42,500
I cast you out,
the prince of darkness...

802
01:23:42,540 --> 01:23:43,620
into hell!

803
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:48,980
A moment's courage,
and it is done.

804
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:50,900
Take the stake
in your left hand...

805
01:23:53,020 --> 01:23:55,540
place the point over the heart.

806
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:01,700
Then in God's name, strike.
Do it now!

807
01:24:16,620 --> 01:24:21,460
Eat, feast. You'll need your strength
for the dark days ahead.

808
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:26,980
<i>- Doctor?
- Ja?</i>

809
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:28,580
How did Lucy die?

810
01:24:31,660 --> 01:24:32,740
Well--

811
01:24:34,540 --> 01:24:36,060
Was she in great pain?

812
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:38,740
<i>Ja, she was in great pain.
Then we cut off her head...</i>

813
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:41,940
and drove a stake through her heart
and burned it and then she found peace.

814
01:24:42,020 --> 01:24:45,220
Doctor! Please.

815
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:50,740
So, Mr. Harker...

816
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:53,620
I must now ask you,
as your doctor...

817
01:24:56,380 --> 01:24:58,100
a sensitive question.

818
01:24:58,180 --> 01:25:00,660
During your infidelity
with those creatures--

819
01:25:00,740 --> 01:25:02,260
those demonic women--

820
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:05,580
did you, for one instant,
taste of their blood?

821
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:17,940
Good!

822
01:25:18,020 --> 01:25:20,500
Then you have not infected your blood
with the terrible...

823
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:22,900
disease that destroyed poor Lucy.

824
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:33,580
Doctor, you must understand.

825
01:25:35,220 --> 01:25:37,580
I doubted everything...

826
01:25:37,660 --> 01:25:39,300
even my mind.

827
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:41,380
I was impotent with fear.

828
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:44,220
- I know.
- But, sir...

829
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:47,980
I know where the bastard sleeps.

830
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:51,580
I brought him there,
to Carfax Abbey.

831
01:25:54,220 --> 01:25:57,780
Vampires do exist.

832
01:25:57,860 --> 01:26:00,900
And this one we fight,
this one we face...

833
01:26:00,940 --> 01:26:03,460
has the strength
of 20 or more people...

834
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:05,540
and you can testify for that,
Mr. Harker.

835
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:08,620
<i>But he can also control
the meaner things of life...</i>

836
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:10,740
<i>the bat, the rodent, the wolf.</i>

837
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:14,860
<i>He can appear as mist, as vapor, as fog
and vanish at will.</i>

838
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:17,380
Now, all these things
Dracula can do...

839
01:26:17,460 --> 01:26:19,140
but he is not free.

840
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:22,500
He must rest in the sacred earth
of his homeland to gain his evil power.

841
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:26,340
It is here that we must find him
and destroy him utterly.

842
01:26:26,380 --> 01:26:29,340
I almost feel pity for anything
so hunted as this count.

843
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:31,580
How can you pity
such a creature?

844
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:34,660
I'll take Mina to my quarters.

845
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:37,100
Good. You'll be safer there.

846
01:26:39,660 --> 01:26:41,940
Mr. Morris, your bullets
will not harm him.

847
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:45,300
He must be beheaded.
I suggest you use your big bowie knife.

848
01:26:45,380 --> 01:26:48,180
Well, I wasn't plannin'
on getting that close, Doc.

849
01:26:49,380 --> 01:26:50,900
Master!

850
01:27:06,980 --> 01:27:09,140
Dr. Jack!

851
01:27:09,220 --> 01:27:12,020
I've been promised eternal life!

852
01:27:14,580 --> 01:27:16,820
Dr. Seward, who is that man?

853
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:19,380
Mr. Renfield. This is no place for you,
Madam Mina.

854
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:22,500
Renfield? I must see him.

855
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:26,900
Mr. Renfield, behave yourself.

856
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:31,060
This is Mrs. Harker.

857
01:27:32,740 --> 01:27:36,420
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Mr. Renfield.

858
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:39,060
It seems I've been
rather naughty.

859
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:43,340
I know you.

860
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:45,260
You're the bride
my master covets.

861
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:50,340
I have a husband.

862
01:27:50,380 --> 01:27:51,940
I am Mrs. Harker.

863
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:55,900
My master tells me about you.

864
01:27:56,980 --> 01:27:58,380
What does he tell you?

865
01:27:58,420 --> 01:28:00,780
That he is coming.

866
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:04,580
That he is coming for you.

867
01:28:04,620 --> 01:28:07,460
Oh, please.

868
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:15,260
Don't stay here.

869
01:28:15,340 --> 01:28:20,060
Get away from these men, please.

870
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:25,140
And I pray to God
I may never see your sweet face again.

871
01:28:28,620 --> 01:28:31,140
And may the Lord bless
and keep you.

872
01:28:41,420 --> 01:28:45,540
Master! Master!

873
01:28:45,580 --> 01:28:48,220
<i>You promised me eternal life...</i>

874
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:51,620
but you give it
to the pretty woman!

875
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:53,700
Dr. Jack!

876
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:55,700
I'm no lunatic man!

877
01:28:55,780 --> 01:28:58,660
I'm a sane man
fighting for his soul!

878
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:02,500
My quarters are spare, but I think
you will find them comfortable.

879
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:04,460
Dr. Jack!

880
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:07,180
Water and toiletries
at your disposal.

881
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:11,780
You'll be completely safe here.

882
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:14,820
Destroy every box.
Sterilize the earth inside.

883
01:30:14,860 --> 01:30:16,780
Leave him no refuge.

884
01:30:16,820 --> 01:30:19,220
Let the exorcism begin.

885
01:30:47,420 --> 01:30:50,340
You have betrayed me.

886
01:30:54,140 --> 01:30:55,980
No, master.

887
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:02,300
I serve you.

888
01:31:02,380 --> 01:31:05,140
I serve only you.

889
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:03,300
Oh, yes, my love.

890
01:32:03,340 --> 01:32:05,700
You've found me.

891
01:32:08,780 --> 01:32:11,140
My most precious life.

892
01:32:11,180 --> 01:32:14,220
I have wanted this to happen.

893
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:16,140
I know that now.

894
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:21,300
I want to be with you always.

895
01:32:21,380 --> 01:32:25,820
You cannot know
what you are saying.

896
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:27,860
Yes...

897
01:32:27,940 --> 01:32:29,980
I do know.

898
01:32:42,340 --> 01:32:46,260
I feared I would never feel
your touch again.

899
01:32:46,340 --> 01:32:48,180
I thought you were dead.

900
01:32:54,860 --> 01:32:58,980
There is no life in this body.

901
01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:04,780
But you live.

902
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:08,300
You live.

903
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:11,780
What are you?

904
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:16,020
I must know.
You must tell me.

905
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:24,900
I am...

906
01:33:26,220 --> 01:33:28,500
nothing.

907
01:33:28,580 --> 01:33:29,940
Lifeless.

908
01:33:31,820 --> 01:33:33,860
- Soulless.
- What do you mean?

909
01:33:33,940 --> 01:33:36,780
Hated and feared.

910
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:40,820
I am dead to all the world.

911
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:42,740
Hear me.

912
01:33:44,620 --> 01:33:46,660
I am the monster...

913
01:33:46,740 --> 01:33:48,740
that breathing men would kill.

914
01:33:50,060 --> 01:33:52,580
I am Dracula.

915
01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:09,780
You murdered Lucy!

916
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:24,300
I love you.

917
01:34:25,580 --> 01:34:29,780
Oh, God, forgive me, I do.

918
01:34:47,620 --> 01:34:50,180
I want to be what you are...

919
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:51,660
see what you see...

920
01:34:51,700 --> 01:34:53,580
love what you love.

921
01:34:57,060 --> 01:34:59,540
To walk with me...

922
01:34:59,620 --> 01:35:02,780
you must die
to your breathing life...

923
01:35:02,860 --> 01:35:05,940
and be reborn to mine.

924
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:09,180
You are my love...

925
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:11,780
and my life always.

926
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:21,180
Then...

927
01:35:21,260 --> 01:35:23,580
I give you life eternal...

928
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:27,180
everlasting love...

929
01:35:28,700 --> 01:35:32,420
the power of the storm...

930
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:36,060
and the beasts of the earth.

931
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:38,300
Walk with me...

932
01:35:38,380 --> 01:35:42,020
to be my loving wife forever.

933
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:44,780
I will. Yes. Yes.

934
01:36:14,540 --> 01:36:17,380
Drink and join me...

935
01:36:18,380 --> 01:36:20,780
in eternal life.

936
01:36:35,380 --> 01:36:36,780
I cannot let this be.

937
01:36:38,380 --> 01:36:41,580
Please, I don't care.
Make me yours.

938
01:36:41,660 --> 01:36:45,620
You will be cursed as I am
to walk in the shadow of death...

939
01:36:45,700 --> 01:36:47,460
for all eternity.

940
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:52,140
I love you too much...

941
01:36:52,220 --> 01:36:53,660
to condemn you.

942
01:36:53,740 --> 01:36:58,660
Then take me away
from all this death.

943
01:37:53,420 --> 01:37:56,820
You think you can destroy me...

944
01:37:56,900 --> 01:37:59,180
with your idols?

945
01:38:02,020 --> 01:38:04,580
Sacred blood of Christ!

946
01:38:04,660 --> 01:38:07,540
I, who served the cross.

947
01:38:07,620 --> 01:38:09,940
I, who commanded nations...

948
01:38:10,020 --> 01:38:12,980
hundreds of years
before you were born.

949
01:38:13,060 --> 01:38:15,060
Your armies were defeated.

950
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:18,980
You tortured and impaled
thousands of people.

951
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:22,140
I was betrayed.

952
01:38:22,220 --> 01:38:25,100
Look what your God...

953
01:38:25,180 --> 01:38:27,900
has done to me.

954
01:38:27,980 --> 01:38:30,900
No, your war with God is over.
You must pay for your crimes.

955
01:38:36,100 --> 01:38:37,380
Christ compels you!

956
01:38:37,420 --> 01:38:40,900
She is now...

957
01:38:40,940 --> 01:38:44,140
my bride!

958
01:38:48,620 --> 01:38:49,820
More light!

959
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:54,740
Light! More light!

960
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:03,300
Unclean.

961
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:07,420
- Get them!
- This way!

962
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:08,980
- Get them!
- They must be found.

963
01:39:09,020 --> 01:39:09,980
Unclean.

964
01:39:10,060 --> 01:39:12,580
<i>We have learned something much.</i>

965
01:39:12,620 --> 01:39:16,300
<i>Dracula fears us.
He fears time.</i>

966
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:19,460
<i>For, if not,
why does he hurry so?</i>

967
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:22,220
<i>He is gone.</i>

968
01:39:22,300 --> 01:39:24,580
<i>How do you know?</i>

969
01:39:24,620 --> 01:39:27,340
<i>He speaks to me.</i>

970
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:30,700
He has a strong
mind connection to you.

971
01:39:32,740 --> 01:39:35,540
His heart was strong enough
to survive the grave.

972
01:39:36,780 --> 01:39:39,780
<i>- You admire him.
- Ja.</i>

973
01:39:39,860 --> 01:39:44,060
He was, in life,
a most remarkable man...

974
01:39:44,140 --> 01:39:46,820
and his mind
was great and powerful...

975
01:39:46,860 --> 01:39:49,780
but greater is the necessity
to stamp him out...

976
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:51,700
and destroy him utterly.

977
01:39:52,780 --> 01:39:54,660
<i>- Doctor?
- Ja?</i>

978
01:39:57,580 --> 01:40:01,140
I know that I am
becoming like him.

979
01:40:01,220 --> 01:40:04,580
Your salvation
is his destruction.

980
01:40:04,620 --> 01:40:08,300
That is why
I want to hypnotize you.

981
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:12,260
I want you to help me find him
before it is too late.

982
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:15,780
Please, help me find him.
Please.

983
01:40:15,820 --> 01:40:18,220
Look into this light...

984
01:40:18,260 --> 01:40:20,900
the light of all light,
into this flame.

985
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:23,780
Your eyes are heavy.

986
01:40:25,380 --> 01:40:27,940
You want to sleep.
Sleep now.

987
01:40:30,860 --> 01:40:34,540
- Sleep.
- I must go to him.

988
01:40:34,620 --> 01:40:36,940
He calls.

989
01:40:37,020 --> 01:40:38,380
What do you hear?

990
01:40:40,620 --> 01:40:42,980
What do you hear, child?

991
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:46,580
<i>What do you hear?</i>

992
01:40:46,660 --> 01:40:50,660
<i>Oh, my prince is calling me.</i>

993
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:55,140
<i>He is traveling across icy seas
to his beloved home.</i>

994
01:40:55,220 --> 01:40:58,300
<i>There he will grow strong again.</i>

995
01:40:58,380 --> 01:41:01,940
<i>I am coming to him
to partake of his strength.</i>

996
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:12,180
<i>We left London by train and crossed
the English Channel in stormy seas...</i>

997
01:41:12,260 --> 01:41:15,260
<i>"28th October"
no doubt from the passage
of the count's ship.</i>

998
01:41:15,340 --> 01:41:19,620
<i>He commands the winds,
but we still have the advantage.</i>

999
01:41:19,700 --> 01:41:23,260
<i>By train, we can reach the Romanian port
at Varna in three days.</i>

1000
01:41:23,340 --> 01:41:25,940
<i>By ship, it will take him
at least a week.</i>

1001
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:30,340
<i>From Paris, we traveled
through the Alps to Budapest.</i>

1002
01:41:30,380 --> 01:41:32,940
<i>The count must sail around
the Rock of Gibraltar...</i>

1003
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:34,780
<i>where we have posted a lookout...</i>

1004
01:41:34,860 --> 01:41:37,580
<i>and then on to the Black Sea port
in Varna...</i>

1005
01:41:37,660 --> 01:41:40,860
<i>where we will meet his ship
and burn it into the sea.</i>

1006
01:41:46,700 --> 01:41:49,700
Home. Home.

1007
01:41:59,060 --> 01:42:01,700
The vampire's baptized her
with his own blood...

1008
01:42:01,780 --> 01:42:03,860
and her blood is dying,
my friend.

1009
01:42:03,940 --> 01:42:05,780
It is no use.

1010
01:42:17,700 --> 01:42:20,860
I will not let you go
into the unknown alone.

1011
01:42:20,940 --> 01:42:25,100
Oh, my poor, dear Jonathan.

1012
01:42:25,140 --> 01:42:27,780
Oh, what have I done to you?

1013
01:42:29,420 --> 01:42:32,500
No, I have done this
to both of us.

1014
01:42:32,580 --> 01:42:34,780
I can hear him.
He's coming closer.

1015
01:42:34,860 --> 01:42:36,700
He's calling me to him.

1016
01:42:41,260 --> 01:42:43,660
Stay with me. Please.

1017
01:42:43,700 --> 01:42:45,580
I am so cold.

1018
01:42:56,900 --> 01:42:58,740
All aboard!

1019
01:42:58,820 --> 01:43:02,420
<i>Noon. Holmwood received a wire
from his clerk at Lloyd's.</i>

1020
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:05,460
<i>The count's ship sailed past us
in the night fog...</i>

1021
01:43:05,540 --> 01:43:07,380
<i>to the northern port of Galatz.</i>

1022
01:43:07,460 --> 01:43:10,580
<i>The black devil
is reading Mina's mind.</i>

1023
01:43:10,660 --> 01:43:13,060
How can we catch him now?

1024
01:43:20,740 --> 01:43:23,140
Varna. Galatz.

1025
01:43:23,180 --> 01:43:24,860
It's about 200 miles.

1026
01:43:24,940 --> 01:43:27,100
I think that with the horses,
we can cut him off...

1027
01:43:27,180 --> 01:43:29,060
reach him before
he reaches the castle.

1028
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:32,060
I will dispatch Van Helsing
straight for the Borgo Pass.

1029
01:43:32,140 --> 01:43:33,660
If we fail in our task...

1030
01:43:33,740 --> 01:43:35,580
you will have to finish him.

1031
01:43:40,260 --> 01:43:43,460
<i>From Varna, Mina and Van Helsing
took a carriage...</i>

1032
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:46,220
<i>and we continued
on the train towards Galatz...</i>

1033
01:43:46,260 --> 01:43:50,020
<i>where we still hoped to intercept
the count before he reaches land.</i>

1034
01:43:50,060 --> 01:43:54,620
<i>I am fearful for Mina.
She is now our decoy.</i>

1035
01:44:06,580 --> 01:44:08,340
I know this place.

1036
01:44:08,420 --> 01:44:11,100
- The end of the world.
- We must go on.

1037
01:44:11,180 --> 01:44:13,020
It is late, child.
We must rest here now.

1038
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:15,540
No, we must go!

1039
01:44:15,620 --> 01:44:17,220
He needs me.
We must go!

1040
01:44:21,540 --> 01:44:23,380
<i>We have passed Bistritza.</i>

1041
01:44:23,460 --> 01:44:26,100
<i>Dracula has outsmarted us again.</i>

1042
01:44:26,180 --> 01:44:29,860
<i>We learned that his gypsies took charge
of the vampire's box at Galatz...</i>

1043
01:44:29,900 --> 01:44:33,380
<i>and are now on
the Borgo Pass road.</i>

1044
01:44:48,620 --> 01:44:51,940
- Here. You must eat.
- I am not hungry.

1045
01:45:42,020 --> 01:45:44,900
You have been so good to me,
Professor.

1046
01:45:54,060 --> 01:45:57,860
I know that Lucy harbored
secret desires for you.

1047
01:45:57,900 --> 01:46:00,300
She told me.

1048
01:46:00,340 --> 01:46:03,300
I, too, know what men desire.

1049
01:46:19,260 --> 01:46:21,100
Will you cut off my head...

1050
01:46:21,180 --> 01:46:23,100
and drive a stake
through my heart...

1051
01:46:23,180 --> 01:46:26,420
as you did poor Lucy,
you murdering bastard?

1052
01:46:30,340 --> 01:46:33,660
Not while I live.
I am sworn to protect you.

1053
01:46:49,740 --> 01:46:52,100
You are safe within the circle.

1054
01:46:52,180 --> 01:46:55,620
I've lost Lucy.
I'll not lose you to him.

1055
01:46:55,700 --> 01:46:57,020
You're whores of Satan!

1056
01:47:00,460 --> 01:47:03,060
This is holy ground.

1057
01:47:03,140 --> 01:47:04,940
Leave this place now!

1058
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:08,860
Leave!

1059
01:47:08,940 --> 01:47:12,140
In the name of God,
leave this ground!

1060
01:47:12,180 --> 01:47:14,060
I command you
in the name of Christ!

1061
01:47:25,580 --> 01:47:28,420
Christ! Damn you!

1062
01:48:04,020 --> 01:48:05,900
Dracul!

1063
01:48:43,060 --> 01:48:45,060
You are...

1064
01:48:45,140 --> 01:48:47,460
near.

1065
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:49,380
My love.

1066
01:49:00,980 --> 01:49:02,380
They're racing
against the sunset.

1067
01:49:02,420 --> 01:49:04,300
It may be too late.
God help us.

1068
01:49:44,100 --> 01:49:45,420
Harker, shoot!

1069
01:49:53,820 --> 01:49:55,460
Charge!

1070
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:33,020
When my time comes,
will you do the same to me?

1071
01:52:35,260 --> 01:52:37,100
Will you?

1072
01:52:43,340 --> 01:52:44,740
- Wait.
- Let them go.

1073
01:52:44,820 --> 01:52:48,620
Let them go.
Our work is finished here.

1074
01:52:48,660 --> 01:52:50,860
Hers has just begun.

1075
01:53:14,060 --> 01:53:16,660
We've all become God's madmen.

1076
01:53:19,020 --> 01:53:20,900
All of us.

1077
01:53:29,500 --> 01:53:33,460
Where is my god?

1078
01:53:33,540 --> 01:53:36,620
He has forsaken me.

1079
01:53:42,620 --> 01:53:45,740
It is finished.

1080
01:53:47,700 --> 01:53:49,580
My love.

1081
01:53:53,740 --> 01:53:55,020
My love.

1082
01:54:02,860 --> 01:54:04,700
<i>There, in the presence of God...</i>

1083
01:54:04,780 --> 01:54:08,340
<i>I understood at last
how my love could release us all...</i>

1084
01:54:08,420 --> 01:54:10,260
<i>from the powers of darkness.</i>

1085
01:54:16,300 --> 01:54:18,820
<i>Our love is stronger than death.</i>

1086
01:54:26,500 --> 01:54:29,460
Give me peace.
