Hartigan told me two years ago...

when I first came
onto this detail.

135

There's werewolves, and there's
hybrid werewolves.

00:10:10,356 --> 00:10:13,120
Now, werewolves are normal...
normal werewolves.

You're shittin' me. You must have gotten
cracked in the head back there.

00:10:16,896 --> 00:10:20,662
You saw what that thing did back there.
You saw what happened to Hartigan.

139
00:10:22,001 --> 00:10:24,834
Tell you somethin'?

140
00:10:24,904 --> 00:10:27,065
All right.
Nine hundred years ago,

141
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,303
a human Saxon knight
made it with a werewolf. Boom.

142
00:10:30,376 --> 00:10:34,312
we got hybrid werewolves. And the biker
guy back there... the one that got away,

143
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,042
the one that killed Detective Hartigan
and the other officer,

144
00:10:37,116 --> 00:10:40,813
ripped through solid steel
and made you shit your pants...
he's a hybrid werewolf.

145
00:10:40,887 --> 00:10:43,014
That hybrid werewolf is out there
right now searching out...

146
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:45,387
the next matriarch
pure-blood.

147
00:10:45,692 --> 00:10:50,061
He needs to mate with her,
breed out the next generation
of pure-blood werewolves.

148
00:10:53,766 --> 00:10:55,996
That's the end
of the history lesson.

This is where we come in.

150
00:10:59,672 --> 00:11:03,301
First of all, I don't give a shit how
or why these hybrids exist, but they do.

151
00:11:03,376 --> 00:11:05,901
Fact is, they're enough of a problem
that there's a quiet little office...

152
00:11:05,979 --> 00:11:10,143
in the back of the Detectives' Bureau

Stay back. Mary?

318
00:23:57,716 --> 00:24:01,880
Take her, quickly...
be-before it returns.

319
00:24:01,954 --> 00:24:03,945
who? Take who?

320
00:24:04,022 --> 00:24:07,651
The girl. Take... the girl.

321
00:24:07,726 --> 00:24:11,662
who's the girl, Mary?
I don't know who the girl is.

- Her?
- You have to-to protect her now.

I can't any longer.

324

what about the other
protectors like you?

325

I-I am the last.

326

I'm not a protector, Mary.
I can't baby-sit some girl.

If you have the girl,
it-it will come to you.

what? Why?

330

If she touches the skin,

331
00:24:51,603 --> 00:24:54,868
Darkwolf will follow
that scent,

332

and-and it will kill them.

00:27:07,673 --> 00:27:10,141
[Sniffling]
She was a nice old lady.

when she'd show up.

Mary ever talk to you
about anything?

Sometimes. Why?

Look, if I'm not under arrest,
then I-I want you to take me
back to my friends now.

A witness to what?
I didn't witness anything.

In fact, I was busy
talking with you...

00:28:06,631 --> 00:28:08,997
when either of those things
happened, if I recall.

what she told me, okay?

It's not your fault, all right?
It's not your fault.

Look, I can do my best
to protect you, okay?

400
00:30:02,214 --> 00:30:04,808
But protecting you
isn't gonna solve the problem.

- I gotta find this thing.

- Do you understand?
- [Crying] No!

404

Josie? I need you
to understand. Okay?

- Shit.
- What?

I lost it.

- She gave me a book to give you.
- To give to me?

00:30:44,022 --> 00:30:47,321
Yeah. She said it would
explain everything you
were going through tonight...

when I was running around.

everything a hell of lot better
than I can.

Oh. Yeah, I called her cell phone.
I got her voice mail.

She never turns it on.
So what are we gonna do, sit around?

Tell me about it.

gonna go find out where she is.

You don't even know where they took her.

I have never seen anything
like that before.

796
01:06:51,688 --> 01:06:56,318
Is it a fucking wild animal
that escaped from the zoo?

797

- That's the thing that killed Tom.

God!

799
01:07:06,035 --> 01:07:07,969
It looks like...

800
01:07:08,037 --> 01:07:11,598
It looks like what I saw when I
was developing the film that we shot.

801
01:07:11,674 --> 01:07:13,505
what are you talking about?

802
01:07:15,511 --> 01:07:18,810
In every shot, there was
something in the background.

803
01:07:18,881 --> 01:07:22,544
I mean, first I was pissed
because I thought my lens messed up.

804
01:07:22,618 --> 01:07:26,110
You know? But then when I looked at
the negative really close, there it was.

805
01:07:26,189 --> 01:07:28,089
It was in every shot.

806
01:07:29,325 --> 01:07:33,227
That... That thing
was up there all that time?

807
01:07:35,598 --> 01:07:37,896
what the hell is it?

808
01:07:37,967 --> 01:07:39,901
A fucking rabid dog?

809
01:07:39,969 --> 01:07:42,597
It sounds like
a massive wolf or something.

810
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,774
I think you just nailed it
right there, babe.

01:07:45,842 --> 01:07:49,039
- Nailed what?
- Werewolf.

812
01:07:49,112 --> 01:07:52,809
- Are you sure it wasn't Dracula?
- I'm serious, Stace.

813
01:07:52,882 --> 01:07:55,248
I mean, that book you found...
the one that we used?

814
01:07:55,318 --> 01:07:57,809
what the hell was
that shit all about?

815
01:07:57,887 --> 01:08:01,084
what are you saying? I brought
that thing because of that damn book?

816
01:08:01,157 --> 01:08:03,682
No. I don't know.

817
01:08:05,528 --> 01:08:10,158
But I know one thing... I mean, I saw
what it did to Miguel, Annie and Tom.

01:08:11,601 --> 01:08:14,161
I mean, this thing
has got some serious issues.

Then you understand
what you're risking.

I gotta agree with
the cute cop here, Jos.

946
01:18:58,781 --> 01:19:00,646
I don't like the idea...

947
01:19:00,716 --> 01:19:03,913
you putting yourself out there
like some kind of bait for this thing.

948
01:19:03,986 --> 01:19:06,113
It's my decision.

949
01:19:06,188 --> 01:19:08,213
I need to help.

950
01:19:11,326 --> 01:19:13,624
All right.

951
01:19:13,695 --> 01:19:15,754
But you two
are down in the shelter.

952
01:19:15,831 --> 01:19:18,197
No way. If she's not going,
we're not going either.

953
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:20,559
- Right, wayne?
- Stacey, this isn't your problem.

954
01:19:20,636 --> 01:19:23,605
- You have to go down there.
- No way.

[Steve]
Look, I can protect her, maybe.

956
01:19:26,208 --> 01:19:29,666
That's gonna be hard enough.
But all three of you... impossible.

957
01:19:29,745 --> 01:19:32,942
- Deal with it, dude.
- I can just order you
down into the shelter.

958
01:19:33,015 --> 01:19:35,040
And we'd resist,

959
01:19:35,117 --> 01:19:38,951
and then you'd have to arrest us and put
us in jail, and we'd still be here.

Maybe 30 minutes
left to full moon.
