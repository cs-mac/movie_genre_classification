00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:14,325
Chris...

2
00:03:15,226 --> 00:03:16,746
Chris!

3
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,534
Easy, now. Easy.

4
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,207
Easy...

5
00:03:35,332 --> 00:03:38,836
Easy. Hey, hey, ok!
All right, climb up there, girl!

6
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:46,928
There you go! Climb on up now!
There you go! There you go!

7
00:04:00,818 --> 00:04:02,862
Get up there now! Get up there!

8
00:04:02,987 --> 00:04:05,031
Ok!

9
00:04:07,992 --> 00:04:10,746
Come on, let's go for it now!
Go for it! Yeah!

10
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,459
Go get 'em, Fawkes! There you go!
There you go! Ok! Yeah!

11
00:04:20,673 --> 00:04:24,386
Go get 'em, Fawkes! Go get 'em!
Go get 'em!

12
00:06:07,498 --> 00:06:09,542
Count it and make sure.

13
00:06:20,595 --> 00:06:23,974
- You a resident in the United States?
- Yes, sir.

14
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:26,560
- Are you a resident?
- Yes, I am.

15
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:29,188
- Any fruits or vegetables?
- No, sir.

16
00:06:29,313 --> 00:06:31,857
- Ok. Thank you.
- Thank you.

17
00:06:42,911 --> 00:06:44,997
Hello there. How are you today?

18
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:48,417
I'm doing fine.

19
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,046
Would you pull over
to the inspection area, please?

20
00:06:52,756 --> 00:06:55,717
- What are these?
- Prescription Lomotil.

21
00:07:05,812 --> 00:07:09,357
- How long have you been in Mexico?
- Just for the summer.

22
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:18,325
- Hi.
- How you doing?

23
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:22,914
- It's... 82nd Airborne. Pleiku.
- 2nd Division Marines. Korea.

24
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:25,082
Yeah? All right!

25
00:07:28,753 --> 00:07:30,797
- Thanks a lot!
- All right.

26
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,391
Where is it? Where is it?
Good boy! Good boy!

27
00:07:41,225 --> 00:07:42,559
Attaboy!

28
00:07:42,684 --> 00:07:44,728
Go get 'em!

29
00:07:44,854 --> 00:07:47,606
That's it! Good boy! Good boy!
Where is it?

30
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:12,842
<i>You can't walk with the ball!
You gotta dribble it!</i>

31
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,807
Hey, Carmen!

32
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:21,519
- Hi, Chris. Long time no see!
- He up yet?

33
00:08:21,644 --> 00:08:23,687
What do you think?

34
00:08:51,551 --> 00:08:55,013
Daulton Lee, we've got you surrounded!

35
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,734
Who's there? Don't move!

36
00:09:05,858 --> 00:09:07,902
It's me! It's me! Don't shoot!

37
00:09:08,028 --> 00:09:10,488
Chris? Chris, stay down!

38
00:09:10,614 --> 00:09:13,617
- They got us surrounded!
- No! I was joking!

39
00:09:13,742 --> 00:09:15,869
I was just kidding! Just kidding.

40
00:09:16,662 --> 00:09:18,497
Hey!

41
00:09:21,376 --> 00:09:24,045
- How are you?
- All right. All right. You're looking well.

42
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,673
Yes, I'm looking very well. So are you.

43
00:09:27,549 --> 00:09:30,761
Sorry about that.

44
00:09:30,886 --> 00:09:33,806
Plop! Little does it know!

45
00:09:37,685 --> 00:09:40,313
You write a friend a letter,
you expect a response.

46
00:09:40,438 --> 00:09:42,690
- That's the way it works.
- Good to see you.

47
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:45,903
Good to see you too, but I'm serious.
I take it very personally.

48
00:09:46,027 --> 00:09:48,948
- I write very few letters.
- I wanted to surprise you.

49
00:09:52,868 --> 00:09:55,663
This isn't a visit.
I'm back for good.

50
00:09:55,788 --> 00:10:00,710
Changed my mind. No seminary.
Just couldn't go through with it.

51
00:10:02,963 --> 00:10:06,716
What have you been up to?
Pass the cantaloupe.

52
00:10:09,552 --> 00:10:10,972
Is this a bad joke?

53
00:10:11,096 --> 00:10:14,558
I thought you'd congratulate me
for coming to my senses.

54
00:10:14,683 --> 00:10:20,524
You're wrong! How many guys do you know
whose best friend is also his priest?

55
00:10:20,648 --> 00:10:24,361
I mean, I could've gone to confession
and told the truth!

56
00:10:24,486 --> 00:10:27,781
- I'm disappointed, Chris.
- When did you last go to confession?

57
00:10:27,906 --> 00:10:29,950
That's irrelevant.

58
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,957
- Did you tell your folks?
- My folks don't know I'm back yet.

59
00:10:36,082 --> 00:10:38,751
That'll be interesting!

60
00:10:40,295 --> 00:10:42,797
<i>The half of the jury committee
yesterday recommended the impeachment</i>

61
00:10:42,923 --> 00:10:45,175
<i>of President Nixon, charging that
connection to the Watergate case</i>

62
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:50,431
<i>he acted in a manner contrary
to his trust as President and subversive...</i>

63
00:10:50,556 --> 00:10:54,144
I don't care what these people say.
The man is innocent!

64
00:10:54,268 --> 00:10:56,479
- Right, dad?
- Keep it up.

65
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,773
Maggie, the garbage.

66
00:10:58,898 --> 00:11:02,861
Come on! You gotta give me this moment!
I may never be right about anything again!

67
00:11:02,986 --> 00:11:05,447
You find this amusing?

68
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,109
Hardly.

69
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:10,578
Dad, it's for you!

70
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,624
<i>- Mr Waldie.
- Aye.</i>

71
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,711

72
00:11:19,588 --> 00:11:21,632

75
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:29,766
- No.
<i>- No.</i>

76
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,934
<i>- Mr Moorhead.
- No.</i>

77
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:33,894
It's unbelievable.

78
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,273
You'll call father Glenn today?

79
00:11:40,068 --> 00:11:44,615
- It won't hurt to talk to him.
- Ma, it's not gonna accomplish anything.

80
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,494
You don't know that.

81
00:11:50,747 --> 00:11:53,249
You remember Tony Owens' son Gary?

82
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,879
- Careful, dad! Careful.
- I'm sorry.

83
00:11:57,003 --> 00:12:01,633
I hired him last summer. I let his old man
know the time had come to reciprocate.

84
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:02,760
Well?

85
00:12:02,885 --> 00:12:05,429
If you have a better idea,
I'd love to hear it.

86
00:12:05,554 --> 00:12:08,349
I don't think you have the faintest clue
what to do to yourself.

87
00:12:08,474 --> 00:12:11,937
- Well, you could ask!
- I'm asking.

88
00:12:15,357 --> 00:12:16,983
Here.

89
00:12:17,776 --> 00:12:21,363
You're to report 9 o'clock
Monday morning.

90
00:12:21,488 --> 00:12:24,116
Here is $10.

91
00:12:24,241 --> 00:12:26,285
Get yourself a haircut.

92
00:12:28,037 --> 00:12:31,708
I don't know what this is, coach, but...
I'm sure it's great!

93
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,251
You're welcome, son.

94
00:12:33,543 --> 00:12:35,963
RTX Credit. Authorisation code, please.

95
00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:41,302
Yes, we show derogatories -
credit and criminal.

96
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:57,570
- You're early.
- You're late.

97
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,907
Chris!

98
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,329
Chris Boyce, Larry Rogers.

99
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:09,749
- How's it going?
- Ok. Pretty good. How are you doing?

100
00:13:09,874 --> 00:13:12,403
I'm just explaining to Larry
that we'd better start

101
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:15,196
making things little more interesting
around here for you

102
00:13:15,297 --> 00:13:17,341
or we'll lose you.

103
00:13:18,175 --> 00:13:21,596
- Going back to school?
- Yes, sir. I plan to next year.

104
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,640
- Medicine.
- Law.

105
00:13:23,764 --> 00:13:28,394
Yeah, that's right. Right.
That's excellent. That's excellent?

106
00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:37,738
I don't know your father.

107
00:13:37,863 --> 00:13:41,201
He's Director of Security
over at Strata Research.

108
00:13:41,325 --> 00:13:43,745
- Retired FBI.
- Yeah, I know.

109
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,835
Good.

110
00:13:55,466 --> 00:13:57,509
That's good.

111
00:14:08,438 --> 00:14:10,565
- Debra.
- Hi!

112
00:14:10,691 --> 00:14:12,735
- Hi. You got a minute?
- Sure.

113
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:16,197
Get out my personal file, please.

114
00:14:17,531 --> 00:14:22,453
- Chris, you know I can't do that.
- I won't tell anyone, I promise. Please?

115
00:14:22,578 --> 00:14:25,874
- Come on...
- I don't have your access code.

116
00:14:29,211 --> 00:14:31,255
I owe you one.

117
00:14:47,564 --> 00:14:49,400
Wait a second.

118
00:14:50,734 --> 00:14:53,195
"File closed. Under review".

119
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:02,747
We've been checking into your background
for some time, Mr Boyce.

120
00:15:02,873 --> 00:15:05,542
You're quite an impressive young man.

121
00:15:08,796 --> 00:15:12,008
Do you ever hear anybody
talking about birds around here?

122
00:15:12,132 --> 00:15:14,176
Birds?

123
00:15:15,094 --> 00:15:16,095
No, sir.

124
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,974
The 'Black World'?
At lunch? Or in the men's room?

125
00:15:19,098 --> 00:15:23,311
You never overheard anybody mentioning
anything about 'Black World' projects?

126
00:15:23,437 --> 00:15:26,065
- Just gossip.
- No, sir.

127
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,318
Know why that is?

128
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:32,363
They don't exist.

129
00:15:33,197 --> 00:15:37,119
At least, not as far as anyone without
high government clearance is concerned.

130
00:15:37,243 --> 00:15:41,582
Do you want to do me a favour and sign
this piece of paper for me, please?

131
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,012
It's backwards.

132
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:06,552
The 'Black World' is a codename

133
00:16:06,578 --> 00:16:10,387
for a family of covert
surveillance satellites.

134
00:16:11,155 --> 00:16:16,620
Conceived by the Defense Department,
manufactured and maintained by RTX

135
00:16:16,745 --> 00:16:20,373
and used primarily by a company
you may have heard of

136
00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:24,628
- ...in Langley, Virginia.
- Central Intelligence.

137
00:16:26,214 --> 00:16:31,720
Circling the earth with their cameras,
heat sensors, microwave antennas

138
00:16:31,844 --> 00:16:36,099
they've significantly lightened
the workload of human spies.

139
00:16:36,891 --> 00:16:41,772
When Brezhnev chats with his mistress
over his supposedly clean phone

140
00:16:41,897 --> 00:16:43,940
the birds listen in.

141
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:46,527
When he takes his dog
for the walk in the park

142
00:16:46,652 --> 00:16:50,198
the birds take a picture of
pissing on the shrubbery.

143
00:16:50,323 --> 00:16:52,950
When he tests his latest warhead

144
00:16:53,076 --> 00:16:57,080
underground somewhere in Siberia
and claims he hasn't

145
00:16:57,205 --> 00:16:59,291
the birds know he's lying.

146
00:17:02,085 --> 00:17:05,882
<i>You'll be working
in the system's nerve centre.</i>

147
00:17:06,006 --> 00:17:10,094
<i>A communications vault, linking RTX

151

<i>that relates day-to-day

152
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:27,196
<i>Correspondence that you will find

<i>You're not to discuss

156
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:41,545
<i>with non-cleared RTX employees.</i>

157
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,424
This is as far as I can go.

158
00:17:47,176 --> 00:17:50,596
<i>Not with your girlfriend.
Not with your parents.</i>

159
00:17:50,722 --> 00:17:52,807
<i>Not with your dog.</i>

160
00:17:52,933 --> 00:17:55,852
<i>Not in the men's room, not over lunch.</i>

161
00:17:55,978 --> 00:17:58,022
<i>Not in your sleep. Nowhere.</i>

162
00:17:59,189 --> 00:18:01,233
<i>Are we clear so far?</i>

163
00:18:28,304 --> 00:18:30,348
Miss...

164
00:18:30,474 --> 00:18:33,977
I'm not the secretary.
There is no secretary.

165
00:18:35,812 --> 00:18:40,985
I think somebody might've made a mistake.
Is this the black vault?

166
00:18:42,111 --> 00:18:44,363
No, but you're getting warm.

167
00:18:50,036 --> 00:18:52,039
The vault's over there.

168
00:19:00,298 --> 00:19:02,341
- Fuck!
- Excuse me.

169
00:19:02,466 --> 00:19:05,721
- Mr Norman?
- Who the hell are you?

170
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:08,056
Christopher Boyce.
Supposed to start working here.

171
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:11,226
Who says you're supposed
to start working here exactly?

172
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:14,272
Well, I was briefed by Larry Rogers.

173
00:19:14,396 --> 00:19:16,649
He didn't tell you?

174
00:19:19,361 --> 00:19:23,698
You were supposed to show me
how to work the machines, I guess.

175
00:19:28,787 --> 00:19:32,916
Larry, this is Gene. I got this kid,
supposed to be working here?

176
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,919
<i>Don't get excited, Gene.
I sent him over.</i>

177
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,466
Sure, but nobody tells me anything.

178
00:19:40,591 --> 00:19:43,678
<i>- I'm telling you now.</i>
- Yeah, ok. Yeah.

179
00:19:45,848 --> 00:19:47,892
- We're working together.
- Yeah.

180
00:19:48,016 --> 00:19:51,896
Well, you didn't tell me that, did you?
I thought maybe I was...

181
00:19:55,274 --> 00:19:58,194
- So, you want a margarita?
- Pardon me?

182
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:00,697
You want a margarita?

183
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:09,289
That'll be your desk over there...
What was your name?

184
00:20:09,415 --> 00:20:11,417
- Chris.
- Gene.

185
00:20:11,834 --> 00:20:15,046
- Gene.
- You're gonna love it here, Chris.

186
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,425
Nobody can mess with you here.

187
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,095
Nobody's got clearance to get in.
Not even Security.

188
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:28,894
Can you turn that thing off for me?
Giving me a fuckin' headache!

189
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,191
Thanks.

190
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:40,032
Yeah! Just the three of us.

191
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,200
You and me and Laurie.

192
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:44,870
- Hi, Laurie.
- Hi.

193
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:47,664
- Want a margarita?
- No. Maybe later.

194
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:51,919
Good. There's not enough anyway.
Ran out of salt. Cheers.

195
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:56,952
I'm surrounded by junkie partners

196
00:20:56,978 --> 00:20:59,703
who turn me in the minute
they get in trouble.

197
00:20:59,802 --> 00:21:02,472
I don't trust any of them.
I'm all alone.

198
00:21:03,306 --> 00:21:06,185
Would you stop that?
This is serious!

199
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:09,229
How much are they paying you
or is that a big secret too?

200
00:21:09,355 --> 00:21:11,815
140 a week, before taxes.

201
00:21:11,941 --> 00:21:15,319
Do you know what I'm offering you?
Do you know what I make?

202
00:21:15,445 --> 00:21:17,989
- Ten times that.
- Easy. It's about to double.

203
00:21:18,115 --> 00:21:21,243
I'm this far away
from a truly amazing connection.

204
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,163
I'll split it with you 50-50,
right down the middle.

205
00:21:24,287 --> 00:21:26,331
Jesus! Nine iron.

206
00:21:28,626 --> 00:21:30,754
- We'll be rich!
- We're already rich.

207
00:21:30,878 --> 00:21:33,131
No. I mean "rich".

208
00:21:33,256 --> 00:21:37,219
Hey, he who dies with the most toys wins.

209

I can't believe
you're really not interested.

211
00:21:42,474 --> 00:21:46,813
I'm flattered I'm the only one you trust,
but I'm really not interested.

212
00:21:46,937 --> 00:21:48,981

You haven't heard anything
about one particular thing?

223
00:24:50,721 --> 00:24:53,599
No. I really wouldn't worry about it.

224
00:24:55,351 --> 00:24:57,603
- Eddie would know. Want me to ask him?
- No.

Why not?

226
00:24:59,063 --> 00:25:04,068
Eddie. Eddie! What do you know about
a covert operation in Australia?

227
00:25:04,194 --> 00:25:06,238
- Chris wants to know.
- Which one?

228
00:25:06,363 --> 00:25:10,952
- Something about labour unions.
- Air-traffic controllers.

229
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:13,537
It's nothing. They're threatening to strike.

230

If they do, it'd stop our personnel
and equipment into Pine Gap.

Don't worry. It's under control.

Like Whitlam! They've been saying
he's under control for two years!

233
00:25:25,509 --> 00:25:27,261
- Who's Whitlam?
- Prime Minister.

234
00:25:27,386 --> 00:25:30,639
I don't know why somebody doesn't
just blow up his fuckin' car.

235
00:25:30,764 --> 00:25:32,808
That's why you're just a clerk.

236
00:25:32,934 --> 00:25:35,520
I'm serious, man!
You make it obvious!

237
00:25:35,644 --> 00:25:38,731
You fuck with us,
you accept the consequences.

238

is a waste of time and the taxpayers' money!

Faggots afraid to get their hands wet!

- Getting that look.
- Fuck you!

Anytime, anywhere.

243
00:25:53,665 --> 00:25:56,918
The man is a communist!
We're letting him walk all over us!

244
00:25:57,043 --> 00:26:01,256
You know, I killed 14 of 'em myself!
Personally!

245
00:26:01,381 --> 00:26:04,135
- That right? College boys?
- Communists!

246
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:08,389
Special Ops. Laos.
Close range, right between the eyes!

247
00:26:10,265 --> 00:26:14,437
- All right.
- You don't believe me, do you?

248
00:26:14,562 --> 00:26:16,439
- I believe you.
- No, you don't.

249
00:26:16,565 --> 00:26:20,485
- Lighten up, Gene.
- The war's over, Gene. Spare us.

250
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,492
Believe it, college boy.

251
00:27:30,896 --> 00:27:31,897
Wasn't done.

252
00:27:32,021 --> 00:27:34,816
Why didn't you tell me
your old man was FBI?

253

Well, cos he isn't any more.

- No, no, no.

308
00:32:07,405 --> 00:32:11,410
- No, I'm talking about a big exposé.
- It's already public!

309
00:32:11,534 --> 00:32:13,662
What happened in Chile was public.

310
00:32:13,787 --> 00:32:16,748
People still don't believe
we engineered that!

311
00:32:16,874 --> 00:32:21,044
- Allende was a socialist.
- He was elected.

312
00:32:22,462 --> 00:32:24,799
People see what they want to see.

313
00:32:24,924 --> 00:32:27,176
- It's unbelievable.
- Well...

314
00:32:28,094 --> 00:32:32,849
I don't know what's going on with you,
but this is insane. It's wrong.

315
00:32:32,975 --> 00:32:35,436
It took a lot of trust
to come to you with this.

316
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:39,974
If you can't see this is wrong,
then you're further gone than I thought.

317
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:40,999
And I feel sorry for you.

318
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,629
You're a drug dealer, Daul!
How can you tell me what's right and wrong?

319
00:32:44,653 --> 00:32:48,909
You wanna say that louder?
I don't think the neighbours heard you.

320
00:32:49,826 --> 00:32:54,164
You wanted to be partners.
I'm offering you a partnership.

321
00:32:54,289 --> 00:32:57,292
Look at it as one of your
many business transactions

322
00:32:57,418 --> 00:33:01,005
and you won't have any trouble with it,
I promise you.

323
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:05,760
Did it ever occur to you that maybe
you're seeing just exactly you want to see?

324
00:33:05,885 --> 00:33:08,221
It's worth significant money.

325
00:33:13,018 --> 00:33:15,437
I don't want anything to do with it.

326
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,941
- What are you smiling at?
- A patriot?

327
00:33:20,192 --> 00:33:22,445
And proud of it.

328
00:33:23,863 --> 00:33:25,907
Come on in!

329
00:33:32,831 --> 00:33:34,875
Matt, this is Clay.

330
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,338
This is Daulton. Dale!
I got a room upstairs.

331
00:33:44,844 --> 00:33:49,141
Excuse me. Nothing personal.
He's just gotta check you out, ok?

332
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,644
Sure.

333
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,627
Go ahead!

334
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:16,796
Don't mind if I do!

335
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:29,935
Accuracy.
I didn't come here to party.

336
00:34:31,562 --> 00:34:33,606
Nothing personal.

337
00:34:35,482 --> 00:34:38,611
- Where are you from exactly?
- Orange County.

338
00:34:38,736 --> 00:34:41,447
- Where exactly?
- Irvine.

339
00:34:42,783 --> 00:34:44,868
Not bad!

340
00:34:44,993 --> 00:34:47,037
Not bad.

341
00:34:49,998 --> 00:34:52,042
What's that?

342
00:34:57,298 --> 00:34:59,342
What's that?

343
00:35:02,888 --> 00:35:06,392
- What's that noise, lke?
- I don't know.

344
00:35:10,271 --> 00:35:13,232
- Police officers!
- Fuckin' cop!

345
00:35:18,446 --> 00:35:22,325
- Hands up where I can see them!
- Hold it right there!

346
00:35:25,578 --> 00:35:28,416
All you have to do is to meet with him
wearing a concealed microphone.

347
00:35:28,541 --> 00:35:32,753
Have a drink, record the transaction.
That's it. That's all we need.

348
00:35:32,879 --> 00:35:34,900
What kind of protection
do my client expect?

349
00:35:34,926 --> 00:35:37,050
I don't think, your client in his position
do expect anything!

350
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:41,021
If this prick opens his mouth one more time,
this conversation is over.

351
00:35:41,047 --> 00:35:42,114
You got that?

352
00:35:42,514 --> 00:35:45,726
Now, what kind of protection
can my client expect?

353
00:35:45,851 --> 00:35:47,736
At no time while you're wired

354
00:35:47,762 --> 00:35:50,714
are you out of reach
of armed assistance, ok?

355
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:54,735
If I can't guarantee your safety,
I don't let you wear it.

356
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:59,824
I would like to discuss this
with my attorney in private.

357
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,994
Jesus!

358
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:10,002
I work for them and I am a dead man!

359
00:36:10,128 --> 00:36:12,338
I set up one buy and that's it!
I won't last...

360
00:36:12,363 --> 00:36:13,163
You seem to not understand.

361
00:36:13,164 --> 00:36:17,427
They are not talking about six months
in some minimum-security work camp this time.

362
00:36:17,552 --> 00:36:20,931
- They are talking about San Quentin.
- I understand it.

363
00:36:21,056 --> 00:36:23,308
I am not an informer, all right?

364
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:27,272
That is against my principles
and I am not going to prison!

365
00:36:27,396 --> 00:36:32,569
- That's the only two choices you got!
- The only two choices I've got?

366
00:36:36,322 --> 00:36:40,244
You tell them anything you want,
but get me outta here on bail tonight.

367
00:36:48,336 --> 00:36:51,506
They'll know what this stuff is, right?
I'm not gonna have to...

368
00:36:51,631 --> 00:36:54,008
They'll know exactly what it is.

369
00:36:54,968 --> 00:36:58,555
They'll know exactly what it is
and this... this is if you get that far.

370
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,558
- There you go.
- All right.

371
00:37:02,893 --> 00:37:04,937
What's it worth?

372
00:37:05,062 --> 00:37:09,776
How should I know how much it's worth?
Get whatever you can. Haggle with them.

373
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:14,614
What?

374
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:18,202
I just walk in there?

375
00:37:18,327 --> 00:37:21,496
Yeah. I mean, what are
they gonna do, shoot you?

376
00:37:21,622 --> 00:37:24,166
They might. You don't know...

377
00:37:24,918 --> 00:37:27,379
You don't even know the address.

378
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:31,383
Hey, there's one thing.

379
00:37:32,217 --> 00:37:36,305
Look at me. Whatever you do,
don't tell them my name.

380
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:39,266
All right?
That's for your own protection.

381
00:37:39,392 --> 00:37:43,604
As soon as you tell them my name,
they won't need you any more.

382
00:37:45,189 --> 00:37:47,859
It's not too late to back out.

383
00:37:48,944 --> 00:37:51,405
Just tell me.

384
00:39:07,988 --> 00:39:10,658
This is interesting. What is it?

385
00:39:36,435 --> 00:39:39,314
- I'm the courier.
- The courier?

386
00:39:41,941 --> 00:39:47,489
American spy satellites. I can get you
all the information you wanna know.

387
00:39:51,618 --> 00:39:54,330
- Sputniks.
- Yes?

388
00:39:57,124 --> 00:40:00,921
- Maybe I'm talking to the wrong guy.
- Who would be the right guy?

389
00:40:01,045 --> 00:40:04,674
- KGB.
- This is an embassy. No KGB here.

390
00:40:06,385 --> 00:40:08,429
Well...

391
00:40:08,553 --> 00:40:10,639
whatever you say.

392
00:40:12,808 --> 00:40:14,852
One moment, please.

393
00:40:16,855 --> 00:40:19,858
The card has something
to do with satellites, yes?

394
00:40:19,983 --> 00:40:22,987
- That's right.
- So you're a spy.

395
00:40:24,821 --> 00:40:27,033
That's right.

396
00:40:27,157 --> 00:40:29,535
Do you have some identification?

397
00:40:38,503 --> 00:40:41,339
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

398
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:44,564
Listen, Alexiei. It's important.

399
00:40:44,889 --> 00:40:47,289
Try to find out who it is.

400
00:40:48,214 --> 00:40:49,325
Ask him...

401
00:40:51,151 --> 00:40:54,039
Find out what a bird is.

402
00:40:56,731 --> 00:40:59,526
Testing. One, two, three. Testing.

403
00:41:12,498 --> 00:41:15,168
Just looking for an ashtray here.

404
00:41:19,047 --> 00:41:21,508
- That's not a candy dish?
- No.

405
00:41:21,634 --> 00:41:23,678
It's an ashtray.

406
00:41:28,683 --> 00:41:30,935
You got a nice office here.

407
00:41:32,229 --> 00:41:35,244
I like the rug particularly.
I'm kind of an expert on rugs.

408
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:36,424
It's Pakistani, right?

409
00:41:37,901 --> 00:41:39,945
I wouldn't know.

410
00:41:52,416 --> 00:41:57,505
My associates are not so sure about
the authenticity of your calling card.

411
00:41:58,299 --> 00:42:01,510
Really? Here's the deal.
Got your notebook handy?

412
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:07,099
Good.

413
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:09,895
I got a friend in LA
who works for the government.

414
00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:12,063
He's not real crazy about the CIA. Ok?

415
00:42:12,188 --> 00:42:15,692
The deal is he gets the stuff out,
gets it to me. I get it to you.

416
00:42:15,818 --> 00:42:19,205
I gotta warn you, this information
is quality merchandise

417
00:42:19,231 --> 00:42:20,723
means real high priority.

418
00:42:20,823 --> 00:42:24,869
I expect to be paid premium prices.
That's it. Long and short of it.

419
00:42:27,247 --> 00:42:31,584
- What's your friend's name?
- My associate wishes to remain anonymous.

420
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,754
Naturally.

421
00:42:35,046 --> 00:42:37,716
And you... What do you do?

422
00:42:39,385 --> 00:42:41,714
I'm a fugitive from the law
on a trumped-up charge.

423
00:42:41,739 --> 00:42:42,637
I'm man on run.

424
00:42:42,638 --> 00:42:45,391
Currently residing here in Mexico.

425
00:42:46,893 --> 00:42:51,356
FBI says I killed a border patrolman
in Laredo, Texas.

426
00:42:53,358 --> 00:42:55,610
You said 'I expect to be paid'...

427
00:42:56,487 --> 00:42:59,865
- Correct. Premium prices.
- But you said 'I'.

428
00:43:00,908 --> 00:43:04,787
- Not 'we'.
- 'We' expect to be paid.

429
00:43:09,125 --> 00:43:11,169
- Hello.
<i>- This is the operator.</i>

430
00:43:11,294 --> 00:43:14,590
<i>- I have a person to person call for Mr Philippe.</i>
- Speaking.

431
00:43:14,714 --> 00:43:16,758
<i>- Go ahead.
- Gracias, señora.</i>

432
00:43:16,884 --> 00:43:18,970
<i>Buenas tardes, Señor Philippe.</i>

433
00:43:19,095 --> 00:43:21,263
Señor Gómez, how is Señora Gómez?

434
00:43:21,389 --> 00:43:26,645
<i>Mucho gusto. Guess what?
You were right. My uncle says 'hi'.</i>

435
00:43:27,437 --> 00:43:29,022
<i>Hello?</i>

436
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:31,400
<i>Hello, Señor Philippe? Hello?</i>

437
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,569
I'm still here.

438
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:35,305
<i>You won't beleve it.
It was beautiful!</i>

439
00:43:35,331 --> 00:43:37,598
<i>They were dying for the stuff!
I just walked in...</i>

440
00:44:03,476 --> 00:44:05,729
"For your new place!"

441
00:44:07,397 --> 00:44:09,441
"Hasta mañana"

442
00:44:09,566 --> 00:44:11,193
"Gene".

443
00:44:17,575 --> 00:44:19,077
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hi, mom.

444
00:44:19,202 --> 00:44:21,246
<i>- Chris! How are you?</i>
- Pretty good.

445
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:25,458
<i>- How's the apartment? Shaping up?</i>
- Yeah, it's coming along.

446
00:44:25,584 --> 00:44:28,045
- How are you?
<i>- Fine, just fine.</i>

447
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:28,975
How's dad?

448
00:44:29,001 --> 00:44:31,047
Great. I'll go get him...
Hold for the second...

449
00:44:31,048 --> 00:44:33,092
No, no. Don't bother him.

450
00:44:33,217 --> 00:44:38,514
Just tell him... I called and...
I'll call him later or something.

451
00:44:39,891 --> 00:44:41,894
Yeah, everything...

452
00:44:42,018 --> 00:44:45,647
<i>Better get off. Your father's
about to break his neck. I love you.</i>

453
00:44:45,773 --> 00:44:48,859
- I love you... too.
<i>- I'll call you back.</i>

454
00:45:07,964 --> 00:45:10,800
Do you know the restaurant
in San Francisco?

455
00:45:11,717 --> 00:45:14,929
No, but I know the restaurant
in Los Angeles.

456
00:45:20,643 --> 00:45:23,981
I'd like you to get into the habit
of calling me Pedro.

457
00:45:24,105 --> 00:45:26,484
- Ok.
- And I'll call you...

458
00:45:27,401 --> 00:45:29,194
Luis.

459
00:45:29,862 --> 00:45:33,033
Luis. Very good.

460
00:45:36,202 --> 00:45:39,831
There's an interesting article
in my newspaper, Luis. Any in yours?

461
00:45:39,957 --> 00:45:41,833
- Several.
- Wonderful.

462
00:45:41,959 --> 00:45:44,003
Maybe I should read them... now.

463
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:56,016
- First rate!
- It was a pleasure to meet you, Luis.

464
00:45:56,141 --> 00:45:59,853
- Enjoy the rest of your vacation.
- You too, Pedro. Adiós.

465
00:46:11,533 --> 00:46:14,703
If I don't show up within 30 minutes,
that something went wrong

466
00:46:14,827 --> 00:46:16,371
and we'll try again next month.

467
00:46:16,396 --> 00:46:16,996
- Ok?
- Ok.

468
00:46:16,997 --> 00:46:19,041
Now, Luis, I must stress this.

469
00:46:19,166 --> 00:46:21,210
Never come to the embassy again.

470
00:46:21,334 --> 00:46:25,381
It's watched constantly, by you know who.
First time you had to. I understand that.

471
00:46:25,506 --> 00:46:27,967
From now on, it can't happen.

472
00:46:29,552 --> 00:46:32,055
- You know Oswald?
- Lee Harvey Oswald?

473
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:34,200
He visited the embassy here.

474
00:46:34,226 --> 00:46:37,544
The CIA has a picture of him
on the grounds.

475
00:46:37,644 --> 00:46:39,709
They photograph everybody.
I want you to promise me.

476
00:46:39,735 --> 00:46:40,881
Alright, cross my heart.

477
00:46:40,981 --> 00:46:43,109
Good. So you understand.

478
00:46:43,234 --> 00:46:45,354
When you've got something for me,
make an X

479
00:46:45,379 --> 00:46:46,578
one meter by the side of arc

480
00:46:46,579 --> 00:46:48,923
at the junction of Juárez and Peralta.

481
00:46:48,948 --> 00:46:51,284
The first Monday of the month.
We'll see it, we'll be in touch.

482
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:55,205
- Tuesday.
- Did I say Monday? I meant Tuesday.

483
00:46:56,915 --> 00:46:59,876
Now, I need to know some things
and I have a list.

484
00:47:01,878 --> 00:47:03,922
The money, Pedro.

485
00:47:04,048 --> 00:47:06,718
It's all right. I've got it.

486
00:47:06,843 --> 00:47:09,346
Safe and sound. I didn't forget.

487
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:12,473
So...

488
00:47:17,187 --> 00:47:21,776
On what frequencies and bandwidths
are the messages broadcasted?

489
00:47:40,755 --> 00:47:42,798
I don't know.

490
00:47:46,803 --> 00:47:50,348
- What are the orbits of the satellites?
- Don't know.

491
00:47:52,309 --> 00:47:56,480
Go ahead, look. Get it over with.

492
00:48:00,734 --> 00:48:03,446
Right, Luis, please, the frequencies.

493
00:48:07,534 --> 00:48:09,369
Told you, I don't know that stuff.

494
00:48:09,494 --> 00:48:12,915
There's no reason to continue
pretending there's a friend.

495
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,918
- There is a friend.
- It serves no purpose.

496
00:48:16,919 --> 00:48:19,588
You can believe
whatever you want to believe.

497
00:48:19,614 --> 00:48:20,657
There's a friend.

498
00:48:20,756 --> 00:48:23,593
Ok, this will be very tedious for me.

499
00:48:23,718 --> 00:48:25,887
I'll copy the questions out in English.

500
00:48:26,012 --> 00:48:29,099
- You can give them to your friend.
- Fine.

501
00:48:29,224 --> 00:48:31,684
For $6000, please sign.

502
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:46,784
- Hey, Irvey!
- Hi. How are you doing?

503
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:48,954
- All right. You?
- Ok.

504
00:48:53,083 --> 00:48:56,129
- Put them on the account, all right?
- Ok.

505
00:49:08,892 --> 00:49:10,936
They're cute, aren't they?

506
00:49:11,061 --> 00:49:13,522
- You look good with her.
- Thanks.

507
00:49:14,523 --> 00:49:17,694
- What's his name?
- This is Fawkes.

508
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:21,072
Named after Guy Fawkes.

509
00:49:21,197 --> 00:49:24,201
- Yeah.
- You heard of him?

510
00:49:25,327 --> 00:49:26,953
No.

511
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:29,539
He was in 17th-century England.

512
00:49:29,665 --> 00:49:33,836
He tried to blow up Parliament,
but... failed.

513
00:49:44,848 --> 00:49:48,560
She'll go crazy if she sees me
preparing her food.

514
00:49:52,648 --> 00:49:54,275
There you go.

515
00:49:54,901 --> 00:50:00,114
Hey, Fawkes, you hungry?
What do you eat?

516
00:50:02,701 --> 00:50:05,329
- You're kidding!
- You may not wanna watch this.

517
00:50:05,454 --> 00:50:09,876
I have to do a little Henry VIII.
It's painless but it's gruesome.

518
00:50:27,227 --> 00:50:31,649
Get rid of her. Meet me at your place
at 2300 hours. That's 11 o'clock. Ok?

519
00:50:31,774 --> 00:50:33,818
- Hi!
- Hi.

520
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:37,405
Ok?

521
00:50:37,531 --> 00:50:40,409
Lana, this is a friend of mine.

522
00:50:40,951 --> 00:50:44,455
Tradecraft.
I don't really look like this. Ok?

523
00:50:52,046 --> 00:50:55,634
$5000. Two for you, two for me
and one for my expenses.

524
00:50:55,758 --> 00:50:58,219
- I can't believe you actually did it.
- I actually did it.

525
00:50:58,345 --> 00:51:00,805
And I didn't even give them your name

526
00:51:00,931 --> 00:51:03,559
though they tried everything
short of the rack!

527
00:51:03,683 --> 00:51:05,727
You son of a bitch!

528
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:10,316
It's a sweet deal, Chris.
Really perfecto.

529
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:18,033
This girl's cute.
Where did she come from?

530
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:22,871
You know, there's a felony warrant
out on you.

531
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:26,542
I know. I wish them a lot of luck.
Check this out.

532
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:33,424
Theodore Lovelance.

533
00:51:34,217 --> 00:51:36,678
- Do you like that?
- Yes!

534
00:51:37,763 --> 00:51:40,140
- Lousy picture.
- Lousy?

535
00:51:40,266 --> 00:51:42,309
Yeah.

536
00:51:42,434 --> 00:51:45,563
They want to know some stuff,
some details.

537
00:51:45,688 --> 00:51:50,235
I accidentally washed it,
but I think you can still read it.

538
00:51:59,829 --> 00:52:01,873
It's for real.

539
00:52:08,045 --> 00:52:10,089
Jesus!

540
00:52:15,804 --> 00:52:17,848
Don't answer.

541
00:52:23,354 --> 00:52:25,398
<i>Chris!</i>

542
00:52:33,198 --> 00:52:36,076
<i>Chris! Chris, open up! It's us!</i>

543
00:52:36,201 --> 00:52:39,413
- Oh, shit!
<i>- Open the door, son!</i>

544
00:52:39,538 --> 00:52:41,582
Just stay there. Ok?

545
00:52:41,707 --> 00:52:43,751
Yeah.

546
00:52:45,253 --> 00:52:47,088
- Hi.
- Hi.

547
00:52:47,213 --> 00:52:49,257
We woke you?

548
00:52:49,382 --> 00:52:52,552
We brought the TV for you.
Where do you want to put it?

549
00:52:52,677 --> 00:52:55,431
On the desk, over to the desk.

550
00:52:55,555 --> 00:52:58,225
It's not bad. It's not bad at all.

551
00:53:02,688 --> 00:53:04,732
Yeah, that's great.

552
00:53:06,568 --> 00:53:09,029
Hello, Mrs Boyce. Hello, sir.

553
00:53:10,405 --> 00:53:12,575
Take these to your mom.

554
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:17,371
I remember that TV.

555
00:53:18,623 --> 00:53:21,084
Here, I'll give you a hand.

556
00:53:25,005 --> 00:53:27,049
My, you're all up early?

557
00:53:27,173 --> 00:53:29,968
Yeah. 11:45.

558
00:53:32,596 --> 00:53:35,057
Just straightening up.

559
00:53:36,392 --> 00:53:39,479
He just dropped by last night.
What was I supposed to do?

560
00:53:39,604 --> 00:53:41,856
It's a tight group down there, Chris.

561
00:53:41,981 --> 00:53:44,476
They like you.
They're impressed with your work.

562
00:53:44,501 --> 00:53:47,322
- Don't mess it up.
- I don't hang out with him any more.

563
00:53:47,347 --> 00:53:48,847
So, you no have to worry.

564
00:53:50,032 --> 00:53:53,119
I was just as surprised to see him
as you were.

565
00:53:53,243 --> 00:53:55,287
Mom, leave the dishes!

566
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:02,254
So they haven't locked you up yet,
Daulton?

567
00:54:02,378 --> 00:54:06,091
No. Too fast for 'em, sir.

568
00:54:14,642 --> 00:54:17,812
Yeah, all the way! All the way!
Keep going! All the way!

569
00:54:17,937 --> 00:54:20,273
You got nine minutes,
then you're gone!

570
00:54:21,107 --> 00:54:24,402
- No problem. It's on the house.
- Really? Thanks.

571
00:54:24,527 --> 00:54:28,783
<i>...In Australia today with the ouster
of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam.</i>

572
00:54:28,907 --> 00:54:33,162
<i>The action, unprecedented in its
75-year history as a federation</i>

573
00:54:33,287 --> 00:54:35,539
<i>was taken by the Governor General</i>

574
00:54:35,665 --> 00:54:40,170
<i>exercising an obscure but inherent
privilege to fire a prime minister.</i>

575
00:54:40,295 --> 00:54:42,964
<i>The business community
applauded the action.</i>

576
00:54:43,089 --> 00:54:46,510
<i>Labour unions protested it
by immediately calling strikes.</i>

577
00:55:12,747 --> 00:55:16,251
Do you know the restaurant
in San Francisco?

578
00:55:47,743 --> 00:55:50,204
That's all right. I'll get it.

579
00:56:27,453 --> 00:56:29,914
- What's the story?
- Change of plans. Get in!

580
00:56:30,039 --> 00:56:32,083
Come on, get in!

581
00:56:56,943 --> 00:56:58,987
Sit down.

582
00:57:03,408 --> 00:57:05,452
Don't be afraid.

583
00:57:26,267 --> 00:57:29,771
I have heard much about you, comrade Lee.
Now we meet.

584
00:57:29,896 --> 00:57:32,982
- How are you?
- Fine.

585
00:57:33,108 --> 00:57:36,195
- Who are you?
- Fine, thank you.

586
00:57:37,363 --> 00:57:39,407
No. Who are you?

587
00:57:40,241 --> 00:57:43,744
A fellow comrade
in the service of peace.

588
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:45,914
Karpov!

589
00:58:03,951 --> 00:58:05,651
Give him the address of the hotel.

590
00:58:05,677 --> 00:58:07,721
This is good for them.

591
00:58:08,146 --> 00:58:11,858
Tomorrow, leave 'Camino Real'
and check inside this hotel.

592
00:58:11,984 --> 00:58:15,446
- What's he talking about?
- 'Camino Real's too conspicuous.

593
00:58:15,571 --> 00:58:18,449
Too many people can see you.
This place is less visible.

594
00:58:18,575 --> 00:58:21,243
- I never heard of it.
- This why it is good.

595
00:58:21,369 --> 00:58:23,413
You'll like it.

596
00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:26,791
Does it have a swimming pool?

597
00:58:44,144 --> 00:58:46,605
Hey! Hey!

598
00:58:47,397 --> 00:58:50,025
What about a ride?

599
00:58:50,317 --> 00:58:54,029
First of all, I don't particulary like
to be kidnapped against my will!

600
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:56,866
I went to the Obelisque in good faith.

601
00:58:56,991 --> 00:59:01,538
Next thing, I'm in an automobile
with this gentleman, almost getting killed!

602
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:03,965
Secondly, that park in the middle
of fuckin' nowhere!

603
00:59:03,991 --> 00:59:05,725
How did you expect me to get home?

604
00:59:05,726 --> 00:59:10,272
I'm out on the street for 2 goddamn
hours waiting for a fuckin' taxi!

605
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:12,859
Thirdly... Excuse me.

606
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:14,955
Thirdly, nobody... not you...
nobody tells me

607
00:59:14,981 --> 00:59:16,788
where I can stay
and where I can't stay!

608
00:59:17,388 --> 00:59:19,162
I went to that fleabag of yours!

609
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:21,459
I'll tell you something!
I am insulted! Alright?

610
00:59:21,559 --> 00:59:23,603
I don't care who you are!

611
00:59:23,729 --> 00:59:25,855
I stay where I wanna stay!

612
00:59:27,649 --> 00:59:32,822
So... tell us about this mysterious
friend of yours, comrade Lee.

613
00:59:33,531 --> 00:59:35,950
You have some money for me or what?

614
00:59:37,369 --> 00:59:39,412
Karpov, give me the envelope...

615
00:59:46,379 --> 00:59:48,421
Is the Negro your friend?

616
00:59:48,547 --> 00:59:51,426
- Is my friend Negro?
- Yes.

617
01:00:01,477 --> 01:00:03,104
Maybe.

618
01:00:07,985 --> 01:00:10,905
Do you know what this is?

619
01:00:11,029 --> 01:00:13,073
Let me guess.

620
01:00:13,199 --> 01:00:15,410
- Camera?
- Camera Minox-B.

621
01:00:15,534 --> 01:00:17,578
Very accurate and very exact.

622
01:00:17,704 --> 01:00:20,457
It's very dangerous
for your friend to...

623
01:00:22,501 --> 01:00:24,544
He's been making Xerox cop...

624
01:00:47,236 --> 01:00:51,365
He's been making Xerox copies,
probably on a machine where he works.

625
01:00:51,491 --> 01:00:55,453
The counters on those machines
are more than likely routinely checked.

626
01:00:56,287 --> 01:00:58,874
So you want us
to photograph them from now on.

627
01:01:00,042 --> 01:01:04,421
- Decent idea. Give me the camera.
- No, this one's mine.

628
01:01:08,551 --> 01:01:11,638
I had an idea that might be
of interest to you, ok?

629
01:01:11,762 --> 01:01:13,648
I know a gentleman in Lima, Peru.

630
01:01:13,674 --> 01:01:16,668
You, people, have down right
an embassy or something.

631
01:01:16,768 --> 01:01:19,104
This guy can get
his hands on heroin.

632
01:01:19,229 --> 01:01:21,649
Large amounts of heroin,
dirt cheap.

633
01:01:21,773 --> 01:01:24,026
It's a fine product.
Here's the problem.

634
01:01:24,152 --> 01:01:27,947
It's difficult to get this stuff out
of South America these days. Alright?

635
01:01:28,072 --> 01:01:33,870
My idea is this. I arrange a buy.
Alright? Say 5 kilos to start.

636
01:01:33,995 --> 01:01:37,290
Your people bring it up
in their diplomatic pouches.

637
01:01:37,415 --> 01:01:40,367
I wouldn't think there'd be
any risk in that. Alright?

638
01:01:40,393 --> 01:01:41,612
We split it 50-50.

639
01:01:41,712 --> 01:01:45,091
I get my end into the States.
You do what you want with your half.

640
01:01:45,216 --> 01:01:47,885
What do you say?

641
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:50,910
- He is serious?
- Yes

642
01:01:55,728 --> 01:01:57,772
Think about it.

643
01:01:59,064 --> 01:02:00,689
This is the Bellas Artes.

644
01:02:00,715 --> 01:02:04,095
The Ballet Folklórico
performs here twice a week.

645
01:02:04,195 --> 01:02:09,701
And, the Polyforum designed
by famous Mexican muralist Siqueiros.

646
01:02:10,618 --> 01:02:13,997
The 'Camino Real'!
This is my home away from home.

647
01:02:14,122 --> 01:02:16,958
It's the finest hotel
in all of Mexico City.

648
01:02:17,084 --> 01:02:20,212
- And you stay there?
- Every time I go down.

649
01:02:21,046 --> 01:02:25,468
- Are you kidding?
- How did this get here?

650
01:02:25,593 --> 01:02:30,766
I call this Lee and Boyce,
the before picture.

651
01:02:36,856 --> 01:02:39,191
What is this? The after picture?

652
01:02:43,696 --> 01:02:47,278
Annie called me and I rushed home
and you know, he's back.

653
01:02:47,304 --> 01:02:49,185
The insanity's going on again.

654
01:02:49,286 --> 01:02:52,748
- See if he'll come over.
- Do you think, could you come over, Ken?

655
01:02:53,665 --> 01:02:58,587
All right, here. Take the torch.
Just put it right by your face.

656
01:02:59,464 --> 01:03:01,716
Let's get this thing set.

657
01:03:02,758 --> 01:03:04,802
What's up?

658
01:03:05,887 --> 01:03:07,514
Nothing.

659
01:03:07,638 --> 01:03:09,682
I'll be right back.

660
01:03:09,808 --> 01:03:12,895
Just get yourself a drink
or something.

661
01:03:14,646 --> 01:03:17,942
I've been playing the stock market
down there in Mexico.

662
01:03:18,067 --> 01:03:20,111
- Have you?
- Yeah.

663
01:03:20,236 --> 01:03:22,906
- Been doing very well, too.
- That's good.

664
01:03:25,867 --> 01:03:28,328
Actually, if you wanna
know the truth

665
01:03:28,453 --> 01:03:31,540
the stock market thing
is just a cover-up.

666
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:38,047
I'm really selling government secrets
to the Soviet Union down there.

667
01:03:38,173 --> 01:03:41,467
That's what the camera's
for to photograph documents.

668
01:03:41,593 --> 01:03:44,665
You really oughta come down there
with me sometime.

669
01:03:44,691 --> 01:03:45,872
What do you think?

670
01:03:45,972 --> 01:03:48,016
I think that'd be great!

671
01:03:48,142 --> 01:03:51,145
- Hi, Clay. How are you doing?
- That's for you.

672
01:03:51,269 --> 01:03:54,773
- Daulton, take a picture of us.
- Daulton!

673
01:04:03,282 --> 01:04:05,118
Hi, dad.

674
01:04:05,244 --> 01:04:07,287
How are you?

675
01:04:07,412 --> 01:04:09,456
Well, I'm fine.

676
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:13,294
It's... good to have you home.

677
01:04:13,419 --> 01:04:16,922
- Thanks. What's up?
- I just had a call from Kenny.

678
01:04:17,048 --> 01:04:19,509
He's managed to reschedule
your court date.

679
01:04:19,634 --> 01:04:21,678
- Terrific!
- Yeah.

680
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:25,932
Now is the time for you to realise
that your situation is serious.

681
01:04:26,058 --> 01:04:27,893
The party, Brad...

682
01:04:28,018 --> 01:04:30,646
Right now, the thing to do
is get those people outta here

683
01:04:30,771 --> 01:04:34,568
and for you to come back to reality
with a better mental attitude

684
01:04:34,593 --> 01:04:35,692
that I've been seeing lately?

685
01:04:35,693 --> 01:04:37,737
What do you say?

686
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:41,074
I know what you're saying.

687
01:04:41,199 --> 01:04:44,035
Daulton, I found $900
on your dresser this morning.

688
01:04:44,161 --> 01:04:46,205
Do you think it's still there
with all of these people?

689
01:04:46,330 --> 01:04:49,499
I took care of it!
I put it in the safe!

690
01:04:49,625 --> 01:04:52,670
Honey, please don't leave
that kind of money just lying...

691
01:04:52,795 --> 01:04:54,964
I want all those people
outta here now!

692
01:05:10,356 --> 01:05:11,378
- Give me that!
- What?

693
01:05:11,404 --> 01:05:12,425
- The camera!
- What's wrong?

694
01:05:12,524 --> 01:05:14,455
You crazy? The government secrets,
the Soviet Union?

695
01:05:14,481 --> 01:05:15,219
She didn't...

696
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:19,115
I don't care if she didn't believe you!
Give me the camera!

697
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:21,910
$189 plus tax.
I think we should split it.

698
01:05:22,035 --> 01:05:23,871
What's this?

699
01:05:23,996 --> 01:05:26,248
- Just coke.
- When did this start?

700
01:05:26,373 --> 01:05:29,084
- It's just coke.
- Really? Don't lie with me. When did this start?

701
01:05:29,210 --> 01:05:32,129
- Are you my mother?
- Don't lie! It's heroin!

702
01:05:32,255 --> 01:05:35,884
I don't even shoot it up!
I just snort it, ok?

703
01:05:36,009 --> 01:05:38,053
How much?

704
01:05:38,178 --> 01:05:42,224
Maybe a couple
of hundred dollars a week. So what?

705
01:05:49,941 --> 01:05:52,193
<i>"Courier is undependable."</i>

706
01:05:53,445 --> 01:05:57,282
<i>"Seek independent channel
of communication."</i>

707
01:07:49,654 --> 01:07:52,950
- Near the harbour.
- Near the harbour, yes. In Tokyo.

708
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:57,955
Well, I don't speak very much.
First of all...

709
01:08:55,685 --> 01:08:58,312
Hello. Daulton Lee, American Embassy.

710
01:09:00,607 --> 01:09:03,276
Ok. Hello.
Daulton Lee, American Embassy.

711
01:09:03,401 --> 01:09:05,946
- De la Guinée.
- New Guinea? Terrific.

712
01:09:07,322 --> 01:09:08,298
Let me ask you.

713
01:09:08,324 --> 01:09:12,228
This clothing, this be considered
formal clothing for your country

714
01:09:12,327 --> 01:09:16,291
- ...or is this the average garb?
- This... garbage.

715
01:09:30,013 --> 01:09:32,057
Excuse me. Excuse me.

716
01:09:34,769 --> 01:09:37,647
- Why aren't you come to visit our country.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

717
01:09:37,772 --> 01:09:39,816
I want to show you something.

718
01:09:41,735 --> 01:09:45,356
- Why wasn't I invited here?
- Just don't say a word.

719
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:46,881
Don't do anything.

720
01:09:53,506 --> 01:09:54,906
Downstairs!

721
01:09:54,931 --> 01:09:56,931
Go on! Go on down!

722
01:10:18,316 --> 01:10:20,819
- What did I tell you?
- I waited for you for over an hour...

723
01:10:20,944 --> 01:10:24,239
What did I tell you?
You never come to the embassy! Never!

724
01:10:24,365 --> 01:10:28,369
How can I make it clearer to you?
If nobody shows up, what do you do?

725
01:10:28,494 --> 01:10:30,955
- Leave.
- Leave!

726
01:10:34,167 --> 01:10:36,627
- Where did you put the X?
- Where do you think?

727
01:10:36,753 --> 01:10:37,676
There was no X.

728
01:10:37,702 --> 01:10:40,298
There sure was, Alex!
You, the guys, screwed up, not me!

729
01:10:40,298 --> 01:10:42,843
Don't try to put the blame on me!
The X was there!

730
01:10:42,968 --> 01:10:45,763
- Which corner?
- Juárez and Marroquí.

731
01:10:45,788 --> 01:10:49,088
- Son of a bitch...
- Ok. We'll talk about it...

732
01:10:49,642 --> 01:10:52,520
Peralta, Daulton...
Juárez and Peralta.

733
01:10:57,109 --> 01:10:59,152
Need I write it down for you?

734
01:11:01,517 --> 01:11:04,517
What are we going to do with him?
He's completely jerk.

735
01:11:06,243 --> 01:11:08,321
Could I have another drink, please?

736
01:11:20,467 --> 01:11:22,928
Relax, Mikhael. Here.

737
01:11:23,054 --> 01:11:25,514
Have another drink.

738
01:11:35,067 --> 01:11:37,319
About time, Mr Karpov!

739
01:11:37,444 --> 01:11:40,531
Now, remember our figure.
30.000.

740
01:12:12,733 --> 01:12:15,152
What's the matter?
Too dark? Too light?

741
01:12:19,948 --> 01:12:24,287
- You took these?
- These were sent from the source.

742
01:12:49,731 --> 01:12:51,817
I had no prior knowledge of this.

743
01:12:51,942 --> 01:12:55,696
I have no idea how this happened,
but I'm gonna find out, ok?

744
01:12:55,821 --> 01:12:58,691
- This is outrageous!
- Karpov, get this punk!

745
01:13:01,453 --> 01:13:06,416
Wait a minute, Mr Karpov.
You want to know his name, right, Alex?

746
01:13:06,542 --> 01:13:10,670
Christopher. Just like the saint.
That oughta be worth something.

747
01:13:13,924 --> 01:13:16,385
These are good, right? Good?

748
01:13:16,511 --> 01:13:18,555
$500 a piece. Yes or no?

749
01:13:21,432 --> 01:13:24,352
Ok, I swear to God!
No money, then that's it.

750
01:13:24,478 --> 01:13:26,605
You'll never see me again.

751
01:13:26,729 --> 01:13:30,650
All right, from now on,
I do my business with the Chinese.

752
01:13:30,776 --> 01:13:32,820
They'll pay.

753
01:13:55,428 --> 01:13:57,472
Do you carry a pistol?

754
01:13:59,765 --> 01:14:00,892
No.

755
01:14:01,518 --> 01:14:03,562
Maybe you should.

756
01:14:06,106 --> 01:14:09,193
Let's see how this works.
How does that fit?

757
01:14:13,405 --> 01:14:16,492
- It's from Chris.
- By George!

758
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:19,078
Listen, thanks so much!

759
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:25,919
My golly! Will you look at this!

760
01:14:26,044 --> 01:14:29,965
Where did you get this?
You can't buy these in the United States.

761
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:32,677
- Peking!
- Come on!

762
01:14:32,802 --> 01:14:36,723
- I sent away for it in England.
- This is so neat!

763
01:14:36,848 --> 01:14:40,435
I taught you how to use one of these.
You'd learn real fast.

764
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:44,106
Took him three years to get the nerve
to take the fish off the hook!

765
01:14:44,231 --> 01:14:47,401
I'll get it, I'll get it!

766
01:14:49,236 --> 01:14:52,824
Chris, it's for you. It's Daulton.

767
01:14:59,873 --> 01:15:01,917
Real bright calling me here.

768
01:15:02,042 --> 01:15:03,669
Pardon me!

769
01:15:03,794 --> 01:15:06,964
Imagine you were drunk!
Thought we'd get a kick out of it!

770
01:15:07,089 --> 01:15:10,050
Listen, don't forget who runs things
and I won't have to remind you again.

771
01:15:10,176 --> 01:15:11,803
Runs what? Now listen...

772
01:15:11,928 --> 01:15:14,211
I've been up at the party
yesterday and today!

773
01:15:14,237 --> 01:15:16,082
I don't have much patience right now.

774
01:15:16,182 --> 01:15:19,269
<i>I had them hooked
and you would've lost 'em...</i>

775
01:15:25,734 --> 01:15:27,611
- Bob.
- Hey, hi.

776
01:15:27,695 --> 01:15:29,948
- This is for you and your wife.
- Really?

777
01:15:30,072 --> 01:15:32,825
There's another in the car.
Can you get it for me?

778
01:15:32,951 --> 01:15:36,663
No problem. Thanks a lot for this.
She'll really like it.

779
01:15:38,957 --> 01:15:41,084
D-4. Wilke.

780
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:45,381
- Now the knee.
- All right!

781
01:16:07,655 --> 01:16:09,698
Perfect! Just perfect!

782
01:16:10,324 --> 01:16:12,743
That's great!
Yeah. Document Control.

783
01:16:12,869 --> 01:16:15,664
<i>- NSA guy on his way up to see you.</i>
- What? Now?

784
01:16:15,789 --> 01:16:18,667
<i>- Just issued him a pass so...</i>
- Oh, God!

785
01:16:18,792 --> 01:16:21,294
An NSA inspector's on his way over!

786
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:24,507
An NSA inspector's on his way over
right now! Laurie!

787
01:16:24,632 --> 01:16:26,676
Right behind you!

788
01:16:27,843 --> 01:16:29,846
Come on, Chris! Let's go!

789
01:16:34,267 --> 01:16:36,103
Come on! Move!

790
01:16:36,228 --> 01:16:38,438
- Laurie, get the broom!
- What broom?

791
01:16:38,564 --> 01:16:41,651
- We don't have a broom?
- I don't see one!

792
01:16:46,531 --> 01:16:49,325
Where did you put the dope?
Behind something?

793
01:16:49,450 --> 01:16:53,247
No, right out in the open!
Of course behind something!

794
01:16:58,669 --> 01:17:00,921
We're never gonna make it!

795
01:17:01,046 --> 01:17:03,924
We're dead! We're fucked!

796
01:17:23,696 --> 01:17:26,157
- Is this your desk?
- Yes, sir.

797
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:54,604
- What's this doing out?
- I don't know.

798
01:17:54,730 --> 01:17:58,401
- Chris, what's that doing out?
- I don't know, sir. What is it?

799
01:17:59,902 --> 01:18:03,239
- Who's the security custodian this week?
- He is, sir.

800
01:18:07,452 --> 01:18:10,330
- Secure it.
- Yes, sir.

801
01:18:18,172 --> 01:18:20,216
Christmas...

802
01:18:23,803 --> 01:18:26,723
- Open it, please.
- Yes, sir.

803
01:18:55,921 --> 01:18:58,382
- Combination?
- Yeah.

804
01:19:05,348 --> 01:19:07,392
Open it.

805
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:56,321
That's... fine, gentlemen.
Thank you.

806
01:19:58,365 --> 01:20:02,286
What can you tell me
about the 'Pyramider Project'?

807
01:20:02,411 --> 01:20:04,663
Thanks. Thanks, Eddie.

808
01:20:09,251 --> 01:20:11,421
- Well?
- It's a dead project.

809
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:17,009
It's abandoned. It didn't even
reach the blueprint stage.

810
01:20:17,886 --> 01:20:19,930
It's worthless garbage. It's bait.

811
01:20:20,054 --> 01:20:22,266
You didn't bring it in, I didn't.

812
01:20:22,391 --> 01:20:26,645
None of us saw anybody bring it in.
It didn't get in here by itself.

813
01:20:27,604 --> 01:20:30,232
Those bastards don't trust us.

814
01:20:35,822 --> 01:20:37,866
Ok.

815
01:20:38,909 --> 01:20:42,204
Ok, fine. Somebody wanna play games?

816
01:20:44,582 --> 01:20:48,753
- That's fine with me!
- Come on, Gene.

817
01:20:55,301 --> 01:20:58,179
Darling, what on earth...

818
01:20:58,305 --> 01:21:01,808
I'm building us a house.
It's in Costa Rica.

819
01:21:02,351 --> 01:21:05,396
It's not started yet.
It's in the architectural stage.

820
01:21:05,521 --> 01:21:08,066
- But I bought the property.
- Costa Rica?

821
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:11,277
The most beautiful stretch of beach
you've ever seen!

822
01:21:11,402 --> 01:21:14,906
4200 square feet,
split-level, 5 bedrooms

823
01:21:15,032 --> 01:21:19,786
4 baths, sauna, jacuzzi, aviary
and an elevator down to the beach!

824
01:21:20,579 --> 01:21:23,207
What's anyone gonna do in Costa Rica?

825
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:30,548
Fish, take long strolls on the beach,
collect shells, relax.

826
01:21:30,674 --> 01:21:33,635
Take it easy for once in your lives.
You deserve it.

827
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:37,514
- They do that here.
- David.

828
01:21:42,270 --> 01:21:44,522
- Yeah?
<i>- Daulton, this is Clay.</i>

829
01:21:45,940 --> 01:21:49,402
Let me get on the other phone, ok?
David, can you hang this up?

830
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:00,164
- Hello there.
<i>- I got a buyer.</i>

831
01:22:00,289 --> 01:22:03,584
<i>- Five ounces, 8500.
- Wait a minute, Clay. Five ounces?</i>

832
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:07,505
<i>- That's what you said. All set.
- Four ounces, I said, not five.</i>

833
01:22:07,630 --> 01:22:13,304
<i>You go back to the bargaining table.
You tell them it's their mistake...</i>

834
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:23,147
Something else about this house.
It's totally solar heated.

835
01:22:23,273 --> 01:22:26,984
When in God's name is it gonna stop?

836
01:22:27,110 --> 01:22:28,320
What?

837
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:31,365
I will not have dope deals
made in this house!

838
01:22:31,489 --> 01:22:33,742
- What dope deals?
- When is it gonna stop?

839
01:22:33,868 --> 01:22:36,120
I'm not dealing dope any more.
I'm out of it.

840
01:22:36,245 --> 01:22:40,249
You jumped bail, you disappeared!
Probation people call us night and day!

841
01:22:40,375 --> 01:22:42,710
- The cops watch our house under surveillance!
- They do not!

842
01:22:42,836 --> 01:22:46,673
- You missed Christmas by a week!
- Wanna know what I was doing?

843
01:22:46,798 --> 01:22:50,302
- You're not here an hour...
- Want to know what I was doing?

844
01:22:50,427 --> 01:22:52,763
- I was doing top secret!
- Brad, please!

845
01:22:52,888 --> 01:22:56,684
- I'm sick and tired...
- Working for the government, CIA!

846
01:22:56,809 --> 01:22:59,228
I was working for the CIA!

847
01:22:59,353 --> 01:23:01,397
Me!

848
01:23:05,986 --> 01:23:09,031
I don't know what I'm doin' any more.
I'm trying!

849
01:23:09,155 --> 01:23:12,659
- Don't worry. They'll get over it.
- You've gotta make up for me.

850
01:23:12,785 --> 01:23:15,580
You've gotta make them happy,
make them proud!

851
01:23:16,539 --> 01:23:18,583
Do you want me to drive?

852
01:23:18,707 --> 01:23:22,963
- No drugs. That's the main thing.
- You just ran a stop sign.

853
01:23:23,088 --> 01:23:25,340
Don't break their hearts
the way I have.

854
01:23:25,465 --> 01:23:28,260
You do and I find out,
I'll kill you, I swear!

855
01:23:28,385 --> 01:23:30,846
Promise me.

856
01:23:30,971 --> 01:23:33,015
I promise.

857
01:23:33,141 --> 01:23:35,184
Do you love me?

858
01:23:36,102 --> 01:23:37,353
Oh, shit!

859
01:23:37,478 --> 01:23:40,148
I gotta lose these guys!

860
01:24:03,090 --> 01:24:05,718
Get out, David!
It's my problem. Run!

861
01:24:23,195 --> 01:24:25,030
Ok! Yeah!

862
01:24:32,705 --> 01:24:35,166
Did he call yet?

863
01:24:35,292 --> 01:24:37,336
Well, when he does

864
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:39,504
tell him it's over.

865
01:24:39,629 --> 01:24:42,007
I want out. It's gotta stop.

866
01:24:45,887 --> 01:24:49,765
I've been thinking, too.
I think it's time we diversify.

867
01:24:49,891 --> 01:24:53,686
- Get a few subcontractors...
- What did I just say?

868
01:24:53,812 --> 01:24:56,689
I heard you. I agree with you.
I think we should retire.

869
01:24:56,815 --> 01:25:00,985
Get somebody else to do the roadwork.
Pull the strings. Ike could be interested.

870
01:25:01,111 --> 01:25:05,408
- Clay. Think Perry could handle it?
- What about your little brother?

871
01:25:05,532 --> 01:25:10,413
- David?
- You'd do that to him! Drag him into it!

872
01:25:11,205 --> 01:25:14,918
- This is a business! We gotta expand!
- You're sick!

873
01:25:15,042 --> 01:25:19,005
It's been nickels and dimes
compared to the possibilities!

874
01:25:19,130 --> 01:25:22,134
- Where are you going?
- It's over, delivery boy!

875
01:25:23,719 --> 01:25:27,432
- Hey, wait a minute...
- Get outta the way! Outta the way!

876
01:25:27,556 --> 01:25:30,268
- Get outta the way!
- I Xeroxed everything!

877
01:25:30,393 --> 01:25:34,773
Every cipher, every document!
Yeah! Make you nervous?

878
01:25:34,898 --> 01:25:40,487
Don't worry. I'm not gonna do anything
with them as long as you're reasonable.

879
01:25:40,612 --> 01:25:44,825
You don't believe me? Go! Go ahead!
That's the quickest way to find out!

880
01:25:44,951 --> 01:25:48,997
- Where are they?
- In a safe place. In a safe place.

881
01:25:49,121 --> 01:25:50,999
You're lying.

882
01:25:51,123 --> 01:25:53,877
How about I give 'em to your father?
How would that be?

883
01:25:54,002 --> 01:25:56,629
Give 'em to the great FBI man!
How would he feel?

884
01:25:56,755 --> 01:25:59,383
A Soviet spy for a son!

885
01:25:59,508 --> 01:26:03,679
This is my livelihood now!
You can't just take this away from me!

886
01:26:04,597 --> 01:26:06,641
- Yes?
<i>- Lius?</i>

887
01:26:09,644 --> 01:26:12,522
<i>- Do you have the merchandise?</i>
- Yes, I do.

888
01:26:12,648 --> 01:26:14,691
<i>Is it better quality this time?</i>

889
01:26:14,816 --> 01:26:19,738
- My associate assures me it is.
<i>- Is he there with you?</i>

890
01:26:21,782 --> 01:26:23,826
No.

891
01:26:24,994 --> 01:26:29,124
- You still there, Alex?
<i>- You'll be delivering it, then?</i>

892
01:26:29,248 --> 01:26:31,292
That is correct.

893
01:26:33,629 --> 01:26:35,881
- The first Tuesday.
<i>- Monday.</i>

894
01:26:36,006 --> 01:26:38,050
Monday.

895
01:27:01,617 --> 01:27:05,538
I know it's a lot to ask,
to work in silence for once!

896
01:27:08,834 --> 01:27:11,086
Fuck! Fuck it!

897
01:27:17,259 --> 01:27:19,303
Let's go out.

898
01:27:22,724 --> 01:27:25,601
- What's wrong?
- You tell me!

899
01:27:40,952 --> 01:27:42,995
What's happening?

900
01:27:45,958 --> 01:27:48,000
Tell me. Please tell me.

901
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:53,340
Come here.

902
01:28:09,190 --> 01:28:11,234
I...

903
01:29:00,288 --> 01:29:03,374
It's just the maid. Later, señora!

904
01:29:05,877 --> 01:29:07,921
Tell her to come back later.

905
01:29:27,018 --> 01:29:28,521
Hello.

906
01:29:29,745 --> 01:29:31,831
Well, hello there.

907
01:29:34,117 --> 01:29:36,161
Hello there. Come in.

908
01:29:38,205 --> 01:29:40,249
Are you well?

909
01:29:40,373 --> 01:29:44,920
I took a few days off.
Called in sick. Need a vacation.

910
01:29:45,045 --> 01:29:47,089
Well, great! Great!

911
01:29:47,757 --> 01:29:49,592
Raul

912
01:29:49,717 --> 01:29:53,221
my best friend from California, Chris.
Chris, Raul.

913
01:29:53,346 --> 01:29:55,390
- Raul.
- Hi.

914
01:29:56,599 --> 01:29:58,643
- We're finished, yes?
- Yes.

915
01:29:58,769 --> 01:30:01,230
Ok. I'll be right back, all right?

916
01:30:36,518 --> 01:30:39,187
- Trouble?
- No.

917
01:30:58,291 --> 01:31:02,004
Look, just relax. I'm not trying
to cut you out of the picture.

918
01:31:02,130 --> 01:31:04,173
Really?

919
01:31:10,930 --> 01:31:14,434
Secret little messages
behind my back. Yeah!

920
01:31:16,103 --> 01:31:18,147
Nice try, Judas.

921
01:31:18,689 --> 01:31:22,068
- Well, you put me in that position.
- Christopher.

922
01:31:26,447 --> 01:31:28,908
Or should I call you 'Falcon'?

923
01:31:30,452 --> 01:31:32,912
- My name is...
- Alex.

924
01:31:34,206 --> 01:31:37,292
- This your first time in Mexico?
- Mexico City.

925
01:31:38,502 --> 01:31:41,631
Daulton is showing you
the more inspiring landmarks?

926
01:31:41,756 --> 01:31:43,799
Yes.

927
01:31:45,593 --> 01:31:49,347
You make a good tour guide, Daulton.
I always knew it.

928
01:31:52,226 --> 01:31:55,145
You know, you're not what I expected.

929
01:31:56,105 --> 01:31:58,357
And you're not black.

930
01:31:59,150 --> 01:32:01,319
- Pardon me?
- It's a long story.

931
01:32:01,443 --> 01:32:04,113
- Where are we going?
- To dinner.

932
01:32:04,239 --> 01:32:07,533
They'll ask about the frequencies,
so don't trip me up.

933
01:32:07,659 --> 01:32:10,329
I told him he'd get them next month.

934
01:32:13,624 --> 01:32:15,500
The operation goes fine.

935
01:32:15,626 --> 01:32:19,839
Unfortunately, one serious problem remains.
Do you know what it is?

936
01:32:19,963 --> 01:32:22,216
- The frequencies.
- Exactamente.

937
01:32:22,342 --> 01:32:25,637
For anything to be worth anything,
we must, as you know

938
01:32:25,762 --> 01:32:29,266
have the daily
transmitting frequencies.

939
01:32:29,391 --> 01:32:33,103
Well, that's not entirely true,
as you know.

940
01:32:33,228 --> 01:32:36,523
The fact is I can't get them.
I don't have access to them.

941
01:32:37,316 --> 01:32:39,777
He assured me that he could get them.

942
01:32:39,903 --> 01:32:41,947
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did!

943
01:32:42,071 --> 01:32:44,532
They're not even kept at RTX.

944
01:32:45,074 --> 01:32:48,829
Only Western Union and the NSA
have the daily list.

945
01:32:48,954 --> 01:32:52,207
Now, I never said I could get them
and I can't.

946
01:33:01,133 --> 01:33:03,594
You know these people, I assume.

947
01:33:06,890 --> 01:33:09,393
- Most of them.
- Good.

948
01:33:09,518 --> 01:33:14,356
What I would like is that you write
a little something about each one.

949
01:33:14,482 --> 01:33:17,151
Their exact job titles to begin with.

950
01:33:18,361 --> 01:33:20,405
- Where are you going?
- Can I talk to you?

951
01:33:20,530 --> 01:33:22,991
Sit down and shut up!

952
01:33:23,115 --> 01:33:25,660
Also physical descriptions of each.

953
01:33:25,785 --> 01:33:29,957
Height, weight and so on.
Their home addresses if you know them.

954
01:33:30,082 --> 01:33:33,544
And maybe some details
about their families.

955
01:33:33,669 --> 01:33:36,089
Drinking habits, religious habits.

956
01:33:36,213 --> 01:33:39,300
Sexual deviations and so on.

957
01:33:48,018 --> 01:33:51,981
Look, none of those people
will help you the way I've helped you.

958
01:34:00,823 --> 01:34:04,411
- Are you trying to get me killed?
- You should never promis some you can't deliver.

959
01:34:04,536 --> 01:34:07,498
You should've lied!
They're not gonna stand for this!

960
01:34:07,623 --> 01:34:12,712
Give these people what they want!
They're watching us through this!

961
01:34:12,836 --> 01:34:16,549
There's wires all over this place!
It's all bugged!

962
01:34:29,272 --> 01:34:32,776
I'm sick of this fucking
hocus-pocus shit!

963
01:34:37,989 --> 01:34:41,702
$10.000 right now or we're gone!

964
01:34:42,619 --> 01:34:45,455
Basura. Just like everything else.

965
01:34:45,581 --> 01:34:49,710
Yeah? How would you know?
I'm sick of talking to a goddamn clerk!

966
01:34:49,836 --> 01:34:52,588
Get me an expert!
Get me somebody who knows!

967
01:34:52,714 --> 01:34:54,799
- You go back on every promise!
- I go back?

968
01:34:54,924 --> 01:34:58,011
- Where's the infrared data?
- Where's the heroin?

969
01:34:58,136 --> 01:35:00,890
- Where are the frequencies?
- Fuck the frequencies!

970
01:35:01,014 --> 01:35:04,226
- Sit down and shut up!
- You sit down and shut up!

971
01:35:04,852 --> 01:35:06,395
Karpov!

972
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:12,068
Call the great Karpov! Every time
you can't handle something! Call him!

973
01:35:12,193 --> 01:35:15,488
Where's the bathroom
in this fucking joint?

974
01:35:24,457 --> 01:35:27,042
I am so curious about something,
I have to ask.

975
01:35:29,128 --> 01:35:34,342
How is it that you and Daulton...
I mean, where do you know him from?

976
01:35:34,468 --> 01:35:36,929
We were altar boys together.

977
01:35:45,438 --> 01:35:49,191
Daulton doesn't know it yet,
but I'm quitting RTX.

978
01:35:49,317 --> 01:35:54,072
I've already given notice.
I felt it only fair to tell you in person.

979
01:35:54,197 --> 01:35:56,825
- That's why I'm down here.
- What will you do?

980
01:35:56,950 --> 01:36:00,162
Going back to school.

981
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:06,419
Well, he's... pretty sick.
I'd better get him home.

982
01:36:06,544 --> 01:36:11,716
No, no, don't go yet! He'll survive!
He always does. Sit down. Please.

983
01:36:16,930 --> 01:36:20,017
Leaving RTX and going to college

984
01:36:21,519 --> 01:36:24,021
is a very good idea.

985
01:36:24,147 --> 01:36:27,442
You should consider
majoring in Russian Studies.

986
01:36:27,567 --> 01:36:29,735
History, language, politics

987
01:36:29,861 --> 01:36:33,365
and then... think very seriously

988
01:36:33,490 --> 01:36:36,785
about applying for a job
in the State Department or the CIA.

989
01:36:36,910 --> 01:36:39,371
Absolutely not!

990
01:36:39,496 --> 01:36:41,708
You know, Christopher

991
01:36:41,832 --> 01:36:43,876
we're not unalike, you and I.

992
01:36:45,461 --> 01:36:49,258
I, too, have had my doubts.
I know what it does to a person.

993
01:36:49,382 --> 01:36:51,426
I know what you're feeling.

994
01:36:51,551 --> 01:36:54,888
What are you talking about?
I'm not a professional at this like you.

995
01:36:55,013 --> 01:36:57,933
This isn't a career for me.
It was impulsive.

996
01:36:58,058 --> 01:37:00,894
I never expected it to go on
as long as it has.

997
01:37:03,856 --> 01:37:06,943
I'm not like you.
You have no idea what I'm feeling.

998
01:37:07,068 --> 01:37:10,572
You want a mole in the CIA,
you find somebody else.

999
01:37:10,697 --> 01:37:14,409
I have a life apart from all this,
unlike you.

1000
01:37:17,788 --> 01:37:20,875
You know, we waited
a very long time to meet you.

1001
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:25,255
We have put up with more
than anyone should ever have to!

1002
01:37:25,380 --> 01:37:27,423
- You owe us.
- Owe you?

1003
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:30,344
Owe you?

1004
01:37:30,468 --> 01:37:34,306
Christopher,
you remember one thing.

1005
01:37:35,474 --> 01:37:37,518
Impulsively or not

1006
01:37:37,643 --> 01:37:40,479
you came to us.
We didn't come to you.

1007
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:44,359
And, whether you realise it or not

1008
01:37:45,318 --> 01:37:47,362
you are a professional.

1009
01:37:52,659 --> 01:37:56,372
The moment you accepted money,
you became a professional.

1010
01:37:57,707 --> 01:38:01,561
You can't leave here tonight
free of it all any more than I can.

1011
01:38:01,585 --> 01:38:03,346
Did you really think you could?

1012
01:38:06,049 --> 01:38:08,510
It's not over, Christopher.

1013
01:38:13,933 --> 01:38:16,185
It's just beginning.

1014
01:38:22,775 --> 01:38:26,071
I cross the border a million times
and I don't get caught!

1015
01:38:26,196 --> 01:38:28,991
Get busted on a felony
and they let me go!

1016
01:38:30,409 --> 01:38:34,288
Everything you give me looks good,
but it isn't. It is basura!

1017
01:38:34,413 --> 01:38:38,543
It is garbage!
I'm not stupid, Chris. I read books.

1018
01:38:38,667 --> 01:38:42,005
- What are you talking about?
- It's called disinformation.

1019
01:38:42,130 --> 01:38:44,173
- Counterespionage.
- What?

1020
01:38:44,299 --> 01:38:46,969
You're backed by the Company.
You're one of them!

1021
01:38:48,220 --> 01:38:51,641
The CIA's got a picture of Oswald
and they've got one of me, too!

1022
01:38:51,765 --> 01:38:55,895
That's all part of the plan,
so it's ok! It's ok!

1023
01:38:57,313 --> 01:38:59,774
So what happens next?

1024
01:39:00,609 --> 01:39:04,821
- You throw me to the wolves?
- Look what that shit's doing to you!

1025
01:39:04,946 --> 01:39:08,283
- It's all that's keeping me sane!
- It's killing you!

1026
01:39:08,408 --> 01:39:12,496
I don't know who my friends are!
I don't know who to trust!

1027
01:39:12,622 --> 01:39:16,167
I don't know who to trust!
Don't throw me to the wolves!

1028
01:39:16,292 --> 01:39:18,878
Listen! Leave your bags behind!

1029
01:39:19,003 --> 01:39:21,590
We'll get on the plane
and get outta here.

1030
01:39:23,341 --> 01:39:25,385
We'll go home.

1031
01:39:29,265 --> 01:39:31,309
Come on, come on...

1032
01:39:33,436 --> 01:39:35,480
I'm ok.

1033
01:39:38,692 --> 01:39:40,736
I'm ok.

1034
01:40:00,590 --> 01:40:03,886
Chris? Chris!

1035
01:40:06,806 --> 01:40:09,183
- What's going on?
- I think I got everything.

1036
01:40:09,308 --> 01:40:12,938
You'd better double-check
just to make sure.

1037
01:40:14,398 --> 01:40:18,444
- What are you doing?
- I don't love you any more.

1038
01:40:18,568 --> 01:40:20,771
I want your things
outta here tonight.

1039
01:40:20,796 --> 01:40:22,440
Chris...

1040
01:41:12,293 --> 01:41:14,546
It's been fun.

1041
01:41:50,052 --> 01:41:52,095
It's about time!

1042
01:41:54,120 --> 01:41:55,620
Where heve you been?

1043
01:42:09,022 --> 01:42:12,609
You gotta promise something: the day
after you graduate to come and see me

1044
01:42:12,735 --> 01:42:14,945
I want to chance
to make you the first offer.

1045
01:42:15,070 --> 01:42:18,241
No of fence, Larry,
but the pay's not too hot!

1046
01:42:19,074 --> 01:42:21,577
Come and see us.
We'll take care of you.

1047
01:42:21,703 --> 01:42:25,165
The Agency can't afford
to let a guy like you get away.

1048
01:42:28,501 --> 01:42:30,671
Chris! Hold still!

1049
01:43:02,156 --> 01:43:05,701
It's about time!
I've been stuck for the last time, Alex.

1050
01:43:05,825 --> 01:43:07,869
From now on, I set up the deals!

1051
01:43:08,295 --> 01:43:12,591
What's this? What's this?
Wanna play this game?

1052
01:43:16,213 --> 01:43:19,090
- Alex, tell this guy to let go!
- Shut up.

1053
01:43:23,938 --> 01:43:26,190
Tell him to let go of my arm!

1054
01:43:30,903 --> 01:43:32,154
Fuck!

1055
01:43:34,382 --> 01:43:35,634
Basura.

1056
01:43:35,659 --> 01:43:37,659
Let's finish it.

1057
01:44:05,916 --> 01:44:07,355
I don't need this shit.

1058
01:44:07,381 --> 01:44:10,322
There's a lot easier ways
of making a living.

1059
01:44:14,718 --> 01:44:17,596
I wanna make one last delivery.

1060
01:44:22,434 --> 01:44:26,564
What do you think? Do you think
I'm making this up as I go along?

1061
01:44:26,689 --> 01:44:28,733
I'm not going down there any more.

1062
01:44:28,858 --> 01:44:31,236
I'm not asking you to.
I'm gonna do it.

1063
01:44:31,361 --> 01:44:32,528
What?

1064
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:37,534
They were just waiting the whole time.
Stringing you along to get to me.

1065
01:44:37,659 --> 01:44:40,224
They don't need you
or want you any more.

1066
01:44:40,250 --> 01:44:41,104
They want me.

1067
01:44:48,421 --> 01:44:52,259
I'm through with running.
I mean, the thrill is gone.

1068
01:44:52,384 --> 01:44:56,179
I'm gonna go to court,
face the music, do time, whatever.

1069
01:44:56,305 --> 01:45:02,269
I'll just get a new start.
I'm sick of this shit. I'm tired of it.

1070
01:45:03,479 --> 01:45:08,109
I'm tired, too.
So tired I can hardly stand it.

1071
01:45:08,234 --> 01:45:12,197
I'm gonna be looking over my shoulder
the rest of my life.

1072
01:45:12,322 --> 01:45:17,077
And for what? There's never
gonna be any reconciliation.

1073
01:45:17,202 --> 01:45:20,706
They're just as paranoid
and dangerous as we are.

1074
01:45:22,792 --> 01:45:26,921
I can't imagine why I thought
they'd be any different.

1075
01:45:27,047 --> 01:45:29,299
Well, fuck them!

1076
01:45:30,467 --> 01:45:33,971
I'm gonna get something
out of this nightmare.

1077
01:45:34,096 --> 01:45:36,557
They're gonna want this

1078
01:45:36,681 --> 01:45:39,310
and they are gonna pay!

1079
01:45:39,435 --> 01:45:41,896
- The frequencies?
- Satellite.

1080
01:45:42,981 --> 01:45:45,025
'Pyramider'.

1081
01:45:45,984 --> 01:45:48,694
- How much are you gonna ask for it?
- 100.000.

1082
01:46:05,922 --> 01:46:07,966
It's too dangerous.

1083
01:46:10,594 --> 01:46:13,097
I'm not gonna let you go down there.

1084
01:47:14,489 --> 01:47:16,533
Alex!

1085
01:47:18,242 --> 01:47:20,412
Alex! Hey!

1086
01:48:24,739 --> 01:48:27,326
Tell these guys
to put their guns away!

1087
01:48:28,578 --> 01:48:31,122
Don't point that gun at me!
Hey, come on!

1088
01:48:32,550 --> 01:48:34,550
We have no claims.

1089
01:48:34,876 --> 01:48:37,963
- I'm an American tourist!
- Exuse me, please! Tell me what's happening.

1090
01:48:38,088 --> 01:48:40,924
- I'm American!
- Yes. Calm down. Slowly...

1091
01:48:41,049 --> 01:48:45,304
- I'm coming down the street, ok?
- I'm with the American Embassy.

1092
01:48:45,429 --> 01:48:48,224
- You happened to be coming by?
- Yes.

1093
01:48:51,770 --> 01:48:54,522
I got separated from my girlfriend.

1094
01:48:54,648 --> 01:48:57,442
- She's gone in this museum...
- It's not a museum.

1095
01:48:57,567 --> 01:48:59,995
Leave this to me.
Let me deal with the officials.

1096
01:49:00,021 --> 01:49:00,845
Just calm down.

1097
01:49:03,532 --> 01:49:05,034
Take your gun out of my ribs!

1098
01:49:07,203 --> 01:49:13,293
Are you the head guy? There's $500.
It's yours. Just forget the whole thing! Ok?

1099
01:49:13,318 --> 01:49:14,818
Callate!

1100
01:49:20,885 --> 01:49:22,567
<i>...an American's been arrested.</i>

1101
01:49:22,593 --> 01:49:25,956
<i>Get over to police HQ right away.
I'll meet you there.</i>

1102
01:49:37,653 --> 01:49:40,989
Like to know what I'm charged with,
if you don't mind.

1103
01:49:50,333 --> 01:49:52,210
Christ!

1104
01:49:53,420 --> 01:49:57,383
I appreciate you coming down.
It's just a stupid mistake...

1105
01:49:57,507 --> 01:50:02,721
- This is Walt Hamilton, Vice Consul.
- Don't worry. We'll get you out of here.

1106
01:50:03,546 --> 01:50:05,846
- Come in, please
- Thank you.

1107
01:50:19,281 --> 01:50:20,783
Occupation?

1108
01:50:20,908 --> 01:50:23,786
I'm photographer.
I work for an advertising agency.

1109
01:50:23,911 --> 01:50:25,955
That's a communications satellite.

1110
01:50:26,081 --> 01:50:29,918
My firm's doing promotional films
for General Electric

1111
01:50:30,043 --> 01:50:32,421
to interest... investors.

1112
01:50:32,546 --> 01:50:35,215
- Documentos.
- Olympics, World Series.

1113
01:50:35,340 --> 01:50:37,384
That sort of thing.

1114
01:50:39,762 --> 01:50:42,807
- It's a postcard.
- Bellas Artes.

1115
01:50:42,932 --> 01:50:44,976
You carry it as a trophy?

1116
01:50:45,726 --> 01:50:48,563
- You like to look at it?
- It's a postcard.

1117
01:50:49,565 --> 01:50:51,609
Look, this is foolish.

1118
01:50:51,733 --> 01:50:55,571
If they're not gonna charge me,
I'd like to get outta here.

1119
01:51:04,372 --> 01:51:08,502
- What's he saying?
- They're charging you with murder.

1120
01:51:08,627 --> 01:51:10,587
You're kidding.

1121
01:51:10,713 --> 01:51:12,756
You've gotta be kidding!

1122
01:51:12,881 --> 01:51:15,426
- Cop killer.
- I am not!

1123
01:51:15,551 --> 01:51:17,553
- Comunista.
- I am not!

1124
01:51:17,679 --> 01:51:20,973
- Terrorista!
- No, I am a tourist.

1125
01:51:21,099 --> 01:51:24,435
I am a businessman.
I am a Republican.

1126
01:51:25,353 --> 01:51:28,023
I have my rights!
I am an American!

1127
01:51:28,148 --> 01:51:30,192
This is not America.

1128

<i>Mr Lovelance? Yes, he is in Room 122.

- Is Mr Lovelance there?</i>

1133
01:52:06,106 --> 01:52:10,236
<i>No, he isn't, operator.
Who's placing this call, please?</i>

1134
01:52:11,069 --> 01:52:14,699
<i>Sir? Would you like to leave a message?</i>

1135

<i>Who is this...</i>

1138

I'm sorry, sir. That London flight
is completely booked.

1139

All I can say is try stand-by
or I can book...

1140
01:52:26,921 --> 01:52:30,841
No. Try Buenos Aires at 4 o'clock.

1141
01:52:30,967 --> 01:52:34,012
- Buenos Aires?
- Right.

1142
01:52:34,136 --> 01:52:36,681
Checking, sir.

Who gave you the assignment
to kill the policeman?

1148
01:53:16,016 --> 01:53:17,851
I didn't kill anybody.

- The United States government.

1150

01:53:25,233 --> 01:53:28,529
- Who do you work for?
- The CIA.

1161
01:55:26,491 --> 01:55:28,535
Where are the wires?

1162
01:56:00,653 --> 01:56:02,697
We're deporting you.

1163
01:56:02,822 --> 01:56:05,283
You have your choice of destination.

1164
01:56:07,452 --> 01:56:11,915
- Costa Rica.
- The Soviet Union or the United States?

1165
01:56:16,830 --> 01:56:18,623
America.

1166
01:56:42,448 --> 01:56:44,201
Lana.

1167
01:56:44,326 --> 01:56:47,621
The FBI's gonna come around
asking questions.

1168
01:56:48,330 --> 01:56:53,001
There'll be all kinds of stories being told.
They'll try to implicate you.

1169
01:56:54,253 --> 01:56:58,383
There'll be stories, lies.
You won't know who to believe.

1170

And that's the look that'll tell 'em
you had nothing to do with it.

1171
01:57:03,805 --> 01:57:05,849
With what?

1172
01:57:09,937 --> 01:57:13,107
I love you... and I always did.

1173
01:57:20,407 --> 01:57:22,451
Adiós, amigo.

1174
01:58:29,356 --> 01:58:32,026
Now, you get out. You just go.

1175
01:58:34,862 --> 01:58:36,906
You're free.

1176
02:00:03,918 --> 02:00:07,630
- Up, shit-heels! Get up!
- Lose the bag!

1177
02:00:07,755 --> 02:00:11,217
- Lose the bag!
- Put your hands up!

1178
02:00:11,343 --> 02:00:14,638
Put your hands up
or I'll blow your head off!

1179
02:00:20,185 --> 02:00:22,646
You fuckin' traitor!

1180
02:00:29,947 --> 02:00:32,491
All right, let's get him outta here.

1181
02:00:34,785 --> 02:00:39,457
July 29th 1974, you signed a security
agreement that you would not transmit

1182
02:00:39,582 --> 02:00:43,503
classified information
to any unauthorised person or agency.

1183
02:00:43,628 --> 02:00:45,046
That's correct.

1184
02:00:45,171 --> 02:00:47,257
You were informed at the time
that such a violation

1185
02:00:47,382 --> 02:00:50,427
could be punishable
under Federal Criminal Statutes.

1186
02:00:50,552 --> 02:00:52,178
Correct.

1187
02:00:52,304 --> 02:00:55,223
Have you, in fact,
violated that agreement?

1188
02:00:55,349 --> 02:00:56,976
You bet.

1189
02:00:57,101 --> 02:01:00,146
Did you remove NSA ciphers
from the communications room?

1190
02:01:00,271 --> 02:01:04,400
Ciphers, Pilot TWXs,
Argus, Rhyolite data

1191
02:01:04,526 --> 02:01:08,238
ground resolution studies,
performance sheets.

1192
02:01:08,363 --> 02:01:11,408
'Pyramider', useless and obsolete.

1193
02:01:11,533 --> 02:01:16,288
Whatever happened
to be lying around that day.

1194
02:01:20,710 --> 02:01:22,754
- 'Keystone Kops'.
- What?

1195
02:01:26,341 --> 02:01:29,427
Security at RTX. 'Keystone Kops'.

1196
02:01:29,553 --> 02:01:32,640
How long have you been
an agent for the KGB?

1197
02:01:34,558 --> 02:01:38,104
I've never been an agent for the KGB.
I work for no one but myself.

1198
02:01:38,229 --> 02:01:42,275
I'm in no political organisations
other than the Democratic Party.

1199
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:44,444
How much money did you receive
from the Russians?

1200
02:01:44,569 --> 02:01:46,613
Personally, or...

1201
02:01:46,739 --> 02:01:51,869
About $20.000. Money's never been
real important to me.

1202
02:01:53,371 --> 02:01:57,208
Early you may references to CIA activities
unrelated to the satellites.

1203
02:01:57,334 --> 02:01:59,794
Could you be more specific?

1204
02:02:00,879 --> 02:02:04,383
I haven't mentioned a word
about the CIA

1205
02:02:05,384 --> 02:02:07,720
but I could be very specific.

1206
02:02:07,845 --> 02:02:10,348
What was your control agent's name?

1207
02:02:11,432 --> 02:02:13,475
What? I'm sorry. What?

1208
02:02:13,601 --> 02:02:15,854
We can continue later if you're too tired.

1209
02:02:15,978 --> 02:02:19,065
No, I'm fine.
I just didn't hear your question.

1210
02:02:19,190 --> 02:02:22,319
Who did you receive
your instructions from?

1211
02:02:24,529 --> 02:02:26,365
My conscience.

1212
02:02:27,616 --> 02:02:30,786
I know a few things
about predatory behaviour.

1213
02:02:33,957 --> 02:02:37,377
What was once a legitimate
intelligence-gathering agency

1214
02:02:37,502 --> 02:02:41,547
is now being misused
to prey on weaker governments.

1215
02:02:47,430 --> 02:02:48,722
We ran out.

1216
02:02:50,349 --> 02:02:52,601
I appreciate fear.

1217
02:02:52,727 --> 02:02:54,771
The chance to face it.

1218
02:02:54,896 --> 02:02:59,026
There's nothing more exhilarating
than confronting your fears.

1219
02:02:59,150 --> 02:03:00,986
What are you afraid of?

1220
02:03:01,110 --> 02:03:05,449
Of people who can imagine and create
sophisticated weaponry

1221
02:03:06,450 --> 02:03:09,661
and a government
that can't be trusted with it.

1222
02:03:12,040 --> 02:03:17,629
We're the only nation that ever used
atomic weapons on other human beings.

1223
02:03:21,883 --> 02:03:23,927
We are capable of it.

1224
02:03:24,553 --> 02:03:27,515
You understand that by turning over
US secrets to the Soviet Union

1225
02:03:27,640 --> 02:03:31,769
you're putting every man, woman
and child in this country in jeopardy.

1226
02:03:31,894 --> 02:03:34,522
They're already in jeopardy.

1227
02:03:35,273 --> 02:03:37,526
There are other forms of protest.

1228
02:03:38,068 --> 02:03:41,363
Are you sorry you didn't choose
one of them?

1229
02:03:44,033 --> 02:03:45,868
Chris...

1230
02:03:47,620 --> 02:03:48,871
Chris...

1231
02:03:48,996 --> 02:03:51,040
What?

1232
02:03:51,166 --> 02:03:53,627
You don't feel you hurt anybody?

1233
02:03:59,258 --> 02:04:01,302
The government's worried, Charlie.

1234
02:04:01,426 --> 02:04:04,430
This case could cause
serious political damage.

1235
02:04:04,555 --> 02:04:06,557
There's debate now

1236
02:04:06,683 --> 02:04:09,729
whether prosecution is worth
the public disclosures

1237
02:04:09,755 --> 02:04:11,420
that might arise in a trial.

1238
02:04:14,024 --> 02:04:18,195
So Chris holds the kind of cards
that could save himself.

1239
02:04:18,320 --> 02:04:22,241
- Daddy...
- Eric! Eric, I'll fix that for you.

1240
02:04:29,207 --> 02:04:33,253
Charlie, all of us realise
that this situation

1241
02:04:33,379 --> 02:04:36,464
could just as easily
have happened to us

1242
02:04:36,590 --> 02:04:38,634
with one of our boys.

1243
02:04:38,759 --> 02:04:42,346
And we all want you to know that,
with your ok

1244
02:04:43,264 --> 02:04:48,477
we'll do whatever we can to see
that this case never reaches a courtroom.

1245
02:04:51,857 --> 02:04:55,569
Two of my boys came home today
from school bloody.

1246
02:04:57,279 --> 02:05:01,659
Teacher just stood around
and watched some kids beat 'em up.

1247
02:05:01,784 --> 02:05:04,454
Do you know what they called them?

1248
02:05:04,578 --> 02:05:07,457
Do you know what they called my sons?

1249
02:05:08,583 --> 02:05:10,627
Communists.

1250
02:05:11,670 --> 02:05:16,800
Charlie, do you understand
what I'm trying to tell you?

1251
02:05:19,345 --> 02:05:22,968
I don't think anybody
should do anything

1252
02:05:22,994 --> 02:05:26,086
to influence this case in any way.

1253
02:05:35,905 --> 02:05:38,156
Let him be judged.

1254
02:05:59,972 --> 02:06:03,893
Christopher! Christopher!
What do you think of your sentence?

1255
02:06:04,019 --> 02:06:08,857
- Do you plan to appeal?
- Do you think you got a fair trial?

1256
02:06:11,818 --> 02:06:13,612
Stand back!

1257
02:06:13,738 --> 02:06:15,823
Do you feel any remorse?

1258
02:06:17,200 --> 02:06:19,368
You guys still talk to each other?
