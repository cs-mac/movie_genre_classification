1
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:49,440
Can I have another?

2
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:53,611
Hey. Can I have some more
coffee, please?

3
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,620
Where you going?

4
00:02:59,624 --> 00:03:01,649
Excuse me.

5
00:03:03,061 --> 00:03:04,756
Bitch.

6
00:03:09,034 --> 00:03:10,797
Hello?

7
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:21,399
Hello?

8
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,984
Anyone here?

9
00:03:49,508 --> 00:03:52,306
Lady. Lady.

10
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:56,344
Hello?

11
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:09,483
What the fuck?

12
00:04:36,688 --> 00:04:38,383
Dean. Dean.

13
00:04:39,758 --> 00:04:43,387
I told you, if you keep falling asleep,
they're going to kick you out of here.

14
00:04:43,387 --> 00:04:46,725
Um, sorry. Won't happen again, okay?

15
00:04:47,732 --> 00:04:49,290
Okay.

16
00:05:26,338 --> 00:05:27,635
Nancy.

17
00:05:27,635 --> 00:05:28,932
Hey, Kris. You can
sit wherever you want.

18
00:05:28,932 --> 00:05:32,167
Actually, I am just here to meet Dean.
Oh, he's right over there.

19
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:34,073
Thanks.

20
00:05:37,682 --> 00:05:39,377
Hey.

21
00:05:40,352 --> 00:05:41,819
Wow, you look like you haven't....

22
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:44,512
Like I haven't slept in three days?

23
00:05:49,327 --> 00:05:51,454
Dean, what's going on?

24
00:05:51,454 --> 00:05:53,222
So, what are we doing after this?

25
00:05:53,222 --> 00:05:56,561
Let me see if we can go
to Ashley's or whatever.

26
00:05:58,103 --> 00:05:59,832
Then I don't know.

27
00:06:00,872 --> 00:06:02,601
Look out, here comes your girlfriend.

28
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:05,004
- Oh, hey.
- Hi. Can I get you guys anything else?

29
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,678
Uh... Um...

30
00:06:11,283 --> 00:06:14,446
No, I think we're good.
We will just get the check.

31
00:06:17,122 --> 00:06:19,784
Is that the only thing
you want to ask her, Quentin?

32
00:06:25,664 --> 00:06:26,688
Asshole.

33
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,331
Hey.

34
00:06:34,706 --> 00:06:36,003
Why is Kris with Dean?

35
00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:42,508
Okay.

36
00:06:43,915 --> 00:06:45,212
Come on.

37
00:06:47,285 --> 00:06:48,513
That's fucked up.

38
00:06:50,255 --> 00:06:51,654
What was that all about?

39
00:06:51,654 --> 00:06:56,123
Um, Jesse's just... He's pissed because
Kris broke up with him.

40
00:06:56,123 --> 00:06:59,161
- I didn't even know they were together.
- Yeah.

41
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,891
I guess I can keep the change?

42
00:07:04,636 --> 00:07:05,660
Yeah. Look...

43
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:08,369
...I am sorry about the mess.

44
00:07:08,369 --> 00:07:10,940
- These guys are just....
- I am used to it.

45
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,509
So you ever get tired
of working here every weekend?

46
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:16,169
Do you ever get tired
of coming here every weekend?

47
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:20,443
Quentin. You coming or no?

48
00:07:23,355 --> 00:07:27,587
Sorry. Look, this should
take care of the rest of it.

49
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,021
- See you around.
- See you.

50
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,064
Listen, maybe you should
talk to somebody.

51
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,533
I did.

52
00:07:41,006 --> 00:07:45,443
And he thinks all my problems
come from my past.

53
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,835
We began going through my childhood...

54
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:50,641
...and that's when they started.

55
00:07:52,884 --> 00:07:54,112
When what started?

56
00:07:54,552 --> 00:07:56,076
These nightmares.

57
00:07:56,488 --> 00:07:58,319
Nightmares.

58
00:07:59,924 --> 00:08:02,256
So, what, you can't sleep?

59
00:08:02,894 --> 00:08:05,192
I can sleep.

60
00:08:05,597 --> 00:08:07,758
I just don't want to.

61
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,334
Okay, Dean, listen to me.

62
00:08:10,334 --> 00:08:13,994
They're just dreams.
Okay? They're not real.

63
00:08:15,006 --> 00:08:16,940
These dreams...

64
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,268
...they're real.

65
00:08:18,877 --> 00:08:20,174
They're not.

66
00:08:20,174 --> 00:08:23,906
They're real.... I am sorry, Kris.

67
00:08:23,906 --> 00:08:25,140
- No, it's okay.
- Kris.

68
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,580
No, no. It's fine.
I am going to go clean myself off.

69
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,980
It's okay. It's okay.

70
00:08:59,684 --> 00:09:01,117
You're not reaI.

71
00:09:01,117 --> 00:09:03,049
You're not reaI. You're not real.

72
00:09:03,354 --> 00:09:05,288
I am now.

73
00:09:06,558 --> 00:09:07,718
Dean, what are you doing?

74
00:09:07,718 --> 00:09:09,951
You're not real.
- Dean, stop it. Dean.

75
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:13,588
Dean, stop it.

76
00:09:14,632 --> 00:09:16,623
Dean.

77
00:09:18,703 --> 00:09:20,136
Dean.

78
00:09:31,449 --> 00:09:33,940
Tragedy can shake us at our core...

79
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,145
...and it can also unite us
in our shared grief.

80
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,915
Today we are gathered and united...

81
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:45,589
...for the tragic loss of a young man
with so much life ahead of him.

82
00:09:46,164 --> 00:09:48,155
Let us pray.

83
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:53,494
Lord, you who can
turn the shadow of death...

84
00:09:53,494 --> 00:09:56,640
...into the light of a new day...

85
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,006
...as we gather to commend Dean
into your hands...

86
00:10:01,006 --> 00:10:06,116
...help us to wait upon thee
with penitent hearts...

87
00:10:06,116 --> 00:10:11,187
...and remind us of he who died
that we might live.

88
00:10:27,772 --> 00:10:31,902
- and the power and the glory
forever and ever. Amen.

89
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,473
Amen.
- Come on, sweetie. It's over.

90
00:10:36,014 --> 00:10:37,641
Yeah.

91
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,759
Let's go say hi.

92
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:54,126
- Gwen. Hi, how are you?
- Alan, hi.

93
00:10:57,068 --> 00:10:58,695
- It's been a long time.
- Yeah, yeah.

94
00:10:58,695 --> 00:11:02,135
Especially under these circumstances.
Yeah, not a...

95
00:11:02,135 --> 00:11:05,105
You know, Nance,
if you need someone to talk to...

96
00:11:05,977 --> 00:11:07,376
I am okay. Thank you.

97
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:09,672
We're setting up a crisis center
at the school.

98
00:11:09,672 --> 00:11:13,214
You know where my office is,
right, Nancy? Yeah.

99
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,716
We're going to head out. Take care.
- Good to see you.

100
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,855
Bye-bye, Quentin.

101
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:39,142
You knew Dean that far back?

102
00:11:39,142 --> 00:11:42,279
Jesus, that is me. But I don't know
how I am in that picture.

103
00:11:42,614 --> 00:11:45,208
I didn't meet Dean until high school.

104
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,511
Come on.

105
00:11:50,922 --> 00:11:55,188
Dean said something right before
he died. Oh, please don't.

106
00:11:55,526 --> 00:11:58,359
He said, "You're not real."

107
00:11:58,359 --> 00:12:01,555
He kept repeating it over and over again.

108
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:04,497
Do you have any idea what that means?

109
00:12:06,704 --> 00:12:10,162
No. I don't.

110
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:15,000
Think about it. What would it mean? That
Dean was on a truckload of medication when-

111
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,203
Jesse.

112
00:12:16,581 --> 00:12:19,982
When it happened, it was like
somebody was making him do it...

113
00:12:19,982 --> 00:12:22,984
...but there was nobody there.

114
00:12:26,758 --> 00:12:28,487
Jesse, you have to believe me.

115
00:12:28,487 --> 00:12:32,790
Kris, it was late and you were scared.
Your mind was just playing tricks on you...

116
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,989
..... that's all.
- I believe you.

117
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,894
You do?

118
00:12:43,641 --> 00:12:45,472
I have seen...

119
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:48,403
- I saw...
- You didn't see anything.

120
00:12:49,447 --> 00:12:52,473
You weren't right there. Kris was.

121
00:12:52,473 --> 00:12:55,676
She's already fucked up,
so leave her alone.

122
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,024
You have no idea what I have seen.

123
00:13:04,562 --> 00:13:06,530
Let's go home.

124
00:14:28,112 --> 00:14:29,807
- Hi.
- Hi.

125
00:14:31,549 --> 00:14:35,610
Hey, Mom, where are all the photos of me
from when I was younger?

126
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,119
- They're not here.
- Oh, well, who knows?

127
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:41,122
They're probably packed away
over the garage. Why?

128
00:14:42,193 --> 00:14:45,060
Because today at the funeral I, um...

129
00:14:45,496 --> 00:14:49,933
I saw a photo of Dean and I
when we were, like, 5.

130
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:52,217
But, you know, it's
funny, I don't remember

131
00:14:52,217 --> 00:14:54,333
knowing Dean before high school.

132
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,837
Who can remember being 5 years old?

133
00:14:56,837 --> 00:15:00,341
Hey, why don't you pack those up?
Dinner's almost ready.

134
00:15:12,957 --> 00:15:14,788
Good night, honey.

135
00:17:46,243 --> 00:17:47,676
Remember me?

136
00:17:51,182 --> 00:17:52,376
Kris? You okay?

137
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,824
What is that?

138
00:18:11,068 --> 00:18:12,592
Uh, nothing.

139
00:18:13,104 --> 00:18:14,332
Just, like, a sketch.

140
00:18:15,706 --> 00:18:17,333
Are you okay?

141
00:18:18,876 --> 00:18:21,367
- Yeah, I am okay.
- Yeah?

142
00:18:22,046 --> 00:18:23,377
Are you okay?

143
00:18:24,582 --> 00:18:26,641
Yeah, you know.

144
00:18:28,152 --> 00:18:32,748
You know, like, if you ever need somebody,
if you ever want to talk to somebody, I-

145
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,287
I am sure you have like a thousand
other people you could talk to...

146
00:18:36,287 --> 00:18:38,792
...but if you want to talk to somebody...

147
00:18:39,497 --> 00:18:40,521
Thanks.

148
00:18:41,866 --> 00:18:45,131
Quentin. You're going to be late to class.
Come on, buddy, let's go.

149
00:18:45,131 --> 00:18:47,532
- My dad.
- I know.

150
00:18:51,876 --> 00:18:55,368
Now, class, it was Pericles
who told the Athenian people...

151
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:58,071
...they should all gather
into the gates of the city...

152
00:18:58,071 --> 00:19:01,309
...while his navaI fleet picked off
the Spartans by sea.

153
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:03,953
Now, it was to be a slow
but sure victory.

154
00:19:03,953 --> 00:19:08,455
The Spartans would never make it over
the walls of the acropolis, Pericles said.

155
00:19:08,455 --> 00:19:10,810
But what he didn't take into account

156
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,995
is that the plague
would eventually strike.

157
00:19:12,995 --> 00:19:16,099
Open your books to page 84.

158
00:19:17,902 --> 00:19:19,392
To further complicate matters...

159
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:22,698
...the Spartans were armed
with a variety of weapons...

160
00:19:22,698 --> 00:19:24,807
...some of them even improvised.

161
00:19:24,807 --> 00:19:28,741
And they would not hesitate to slaughter
every Athenian they saw...

162
00:19:28,741 --> 00:19:30,676
...even children.

163
00:19:30,676 --> 00:19:35,410
Especially the children of soldiers.
This is where the...

164
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:36,985
Wake up.

165
00:19:36,985 --> 00:19:39,987
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

166
00:19:42,927 --> 00:19:46,624
You really shouldn't fall asleep in class.

167
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:59,371
Hi, Kris.
- Who are you?

168
00:19:59,371 --> 00:20:02,637
You look just as beautiful...

169
00:20:03,047 --> 00:20:05,311
...as ever.

170
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,847
You have nothing to worry about.

171
00:20:13,691 --> 00:20:15,784
This won't hurt...

172
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,452
...one...

173
00:20:18,162 --> 00:20:20,027
...little...

174
00:20:20,027 --> 00:20:21,221
...bit.

175
00:20:24,301 --> 00:20:26,292
Are you okay, Miss Fowles?

176
00:20:27,171 --> 00:20:29,071
What happened?

177
00:20:30,207 --> 00:20:31,674
I am sorry.

178
00:20:39,617 --> 00:20:41,278
What?

179
00:20:54,965 --> 00:20:56,626
Kris.

180
00:21:31,202 --> 00:21:32,897
Rufus.

181
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,532
Rufus, what are you doing?

182
00:21:35,573 --> 00:21:38,542
Huh? What are you doing out here?

183
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,937
Come on.

184
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:43,203
Rufus.

185
00:21:45,549 --> 00:21:47,141
Come on.

186
00:22:09,874 --> 00:22:10,898
Hey.

187
00:22:10,898 --> 00:22:14,272
I have to fly to London
on a redeye tonight.

188
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:16,037
Okay.

189
00:22:19,383 --> 00:22:20,975
You going to be okay?

190
00:22:21,518 --> 00:22:23,349
Yeah, I am fine.

191
00:22:23,754 --> 00:22:26,314
I am going to be all right.
Have a safe flight.

192
00:22:26,314 --> 00:22:28,754
I just worry about you.

193
00:22:28,754 --> 00:22:31,861
- Try and get some sleep.
- Okay.

194
00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:34,761
I will call you when I land.

195
00:22:36,533 --> 00:22:37,864
I love you.

196
00:22:37,864 --> 00:22:39,696
Love you.

197
00:23:47,071 --> 00:23:48,197
Jesus, Jesse.

198
00:23:51,141 --> 00:23:53,905
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Are you going to let me in?

199
00:23:53,905 --> 00:23:56,171
Yeah, come in.

200
00:24:01,785 --> 00:24:03,685
All right,
I know I have been an asshole...

201
00:24:03,685 --> 00:24:06,948
...and I have been jealous
and I have been fucked up.

202
00:24:06,948 --> 00:24:10,025
But Dean was my friend too.

203
00:24:10,025 --> 00:24:12,389
Will you please tell me
what's been going on?

204
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:17,931
I am having these dreams.

205
00:24:20,304 --> 00:24:21,601
And I am scared.

206
00:24:22,706 --> 00:24:25,402
I think Dean was having them too.

207
00:24:31,415 --> 00:24:33,713
Kris, listen, we have all-

208
00:24:33,713 --> 00:24:35,977
I know what you're going to say.

209
00:24:38,856 --> 00:24:41,654
But now every time I dream...

210
00:24:42,726 --> 00:24:45,217
...I always see this man.

211
00:24:46,797 --> 00:24:48,594
And he's...

212
00:24:51,235 --> 00:24:52,930
He's burned...

213
00:24:54,938 --> 00:24:57,566
...and melted.
And he's always trying to...

214
00:24:57,566 --> 00:25:00,505
...... attack me with these knives...
- Knives on his fingers.

215
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,207
What?

216
00:25:06,417 --> 00:25:07,850
Oh, my God.

217
00:25:09,953 --> 00:25:11,614
We're having the same dream.

218
00:25:11,614 --> 00:25:13,848
- Kris, it's not possible.
- It is possible.

219
00:25:13,848 --> 00:25:15,651
- It's just a dream, all right?
- It's not a dream.

220
00:25:15,993 --> 00:25:17,961
Shh. Shh.

221
00:25:19,063 --> 00:25:20,792
Shh. Shh.

222
00:25:20,792 --> 00:25:22,488
Oh, God.

223
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:24,357
I am so afraid.

224
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:28,801
AII I want to do is go to sleep, but if
I do he's going to kill me like Dean.

225
00:25:31,308 --> 00:25:33,776
Maybe we should just
stop talking about it, all right?

226
00:25:33,776 --> 00:25:36,191
We keep talking about
it, we will keep thinking

227
00:25:36,191 --> 00:25:38,438
about it, then we will
keep dreaming about it.

228
00:25:39,783 --> 00:25:41,478
Look at me.

229
00:25:45,456 --> 00:25:47,390
You will stay with me?

230
00:25:47,791 --> 00:25:50,055
Of course I will stay with you.

231
00:26:12,116 --> 00:26:13,947
Rufus.

232
00:26:14,585 --> 00:26:16,075
Rufus, get in here.

233
00:26:17,588 --> 00:26:18,919
Rufus.

234
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:21,250
Ugh. Shit.

235
00:26:23,894 --> 00:26:25,725
Rufus.

236
00:26:28,665 --> 00:26:30,496
Rufus?

237
00:26:34,605 --> 00:26:36,800
Rufus, come here, boy.

238
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,737
Come here.

239
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:47,500
Ru-

240
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:56,384
Ru.... Rufus.

241
00:27:00,364 --> 00:27:02,195
Oh, my-

242
00:27:03,834 --> 00:27:06,268
I was just petting him.

243
00:27:08,572 --> 00:27:10,506
Jess. Help.

244
00:27:10,506 --> 00:27:11,346
No. No.

245
00:27:13,277 --> 00:27:15,745
Help me, please. Help me.

246
00:27:43,507 --> 00:27:44,804
<i>One, two</i>

247
00:27:44,804 --> 00:27:46,442
<i>Freddy's coming for you</i>

248
00:27:46,442 --> 00:27:48,174
Come on. Come on.

249
00:27:48,174 --> 00:27:49,738
<i>Three, four, better lock your door</i>

250
00:27:49,738 --> 00:27:51,175
We have to hide.

251
00:27:51,175 --> 00:27:54,442
<i>Five, six, grab your crucifix
Five...</i>

252
00:27:54,952 --> 00:27:56,300
<i>Seven, eight, going to stay up late</i>

253
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,648
...four...

254
00:27:57,648 --> 00:27:59,652
...three...

255
00:27:59,652 --> 00:28:01,950
...two...

256
00:28:02,326 --> 00:28:03,850
...one.

257
00:28:04,795 --> 00:28:07,263
- Ready or not...
- Oh, my God.

258
00:28:08,999 --> 00:28:12,127
...here I come.

259
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,212
- Jesse?
- Mm.

260
00:28:31,212 --> 00:28:33,083
Jess?

261
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,805
Found you.

262
00:29:27,911 --> 00:29:30,436
Kris. All right...
Hey. Hey. Kris, stop.

263
00:29:30,914 --> 00:29:33,075
Kris. Stop. Kris.

264
00:29:40,324 --> 00:29:41,951
Oh, my God.

265
00:29:41,951 --> 00:29:43,558
Wake up.

266
00:29:43,894 --> 00:29:45,225
Kris.

267
00:29:46,263 --> 00:29:47,594
Kris.

268
00:30:00,777 --> 00:30:02,802
Oh, shit.

269
00:30:04,848 --> 00:30:06,475
Kris?

270
00:30:09,453 --> 00:30:11,148
Oh, God.

271
00:30:12,689 --> 00:30:14,384
Kris?

272
00:30:20,063 --> 00:30:22,224
Oh, shit.

273
00:30:26,236 --> 00:30:27,794
Fuck.

274
00:30:39,249 --> 00:30:40,443
Okay, okay.

275
00:30:40,443 --> 00:30:42,881
Okay, okay, okay.

276
00:30:42,881 --> 00:30:45,749
Hey. Hey, you. I am calling the cops.

277
00:30:50,227 --> 00:30:51,626
Honey?

278
00:30:55,565 --> 00:30:56,793
Nancy.

279
00:30:57,968 --> 00:31:00,334
- Nancy.
- Yeah?

280
00:31:00,871 --> 00:31:03,567
It's the middle of the night.
You need to go to sleep, hon.

281
00:31:03,567 --> 00:31:04,764
Okay, I will.

282
00:31:04,764 --> 00:31:07,102
- Now.
- Okay.

283
00:31:17,254 --> 00:31:18,482
Shh. Shh. Shh.

284
00:31:18,482 --> 00:31:21,624
- Nancy, it's me. It's me.
- Jesse. What the.....?

285
00:31:21,992 --> 00:31:23,619
- Hey, hey.
- What are you doing here?

286
00:31:23,619 --> 00:31:26,957
- Stop. Just listen to me, okay?
- What happened to you?

287
00:31:27,597 --> 00:31:31,590
Whose blood is that? Is it your blood?
Listen, okay? Please.

288
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,827
- I was with Kris and....
- What'd you do to her?

289
00:31:33,827 --> 00:31:36,188
I didn't do anything,
I am trying to tell you.

290
00:31:36,188 --> 00:31:38,373
Listen to me, something's
going on, okay?

291
00:31:38,373 --> 00:31:42,137
- Tell me what happened to Kris, Jesse.
- Someone killed her in her sleep.

292
00:31:44,981 --> 00:31:46,778
What?

293
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:49,948
- What are you talking about?
- Don't pretend you don't know...

294
00:31:49,948 --> 00:31:52,486
...because you do.
You said it at the funeral.

295
00:31:52,486 --> 00:31:55,557
He's the one who's trying
to kill us in our dreams.

296
00:31:56,092 --> 00:31:59,255
- All I keep hearing is the song.
- What song?

297
00:32:01,431 --> 00:32:02,921
One, two

298
00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:06,200
Freddy's coming for you.

299
00:32:07,404 --> 00:32:08,496
Freddy.

300
00:32:10,774 --> 00:32:12,019
That's his name and
he's in all of our heads.

301
00:32:12,019 --> 00:32:13,265
No, that's impossible. No.

302
00:32:14,845 --> 00:32:16,176
Nancy.

303
00:32:16,176 --> 00:32:19,076
Shit. We got to stop this.

304
00:32:19,076 --> 00:32:21,683
- How?
- I don't know.

305
00:32:21,683 --> 00:32:23,843
Just don't fall asleep.

306
00:32:23,843 --> 00:32:26,215
If you die in your dreams,
you die for real.

307
00:32:26,215 --> 00:32:29,153
Nancy? Who's in there?

308
00:32:33,463 --> 00:32:34,487
Oh, shit.

309
00:32:42,706 --> 00:32:44,537
Police. Don't move.

310
00:32:46,443 --> 00:32:48,536
Get down. Get down.

311
00:32:48,536 --> 00:32:50,043
- I didn't do anything.
Down.

312
00:32:50,043 --> 00:32:52,238
Listen to me,
I didn't do anything. Please.

313
00:32:52,238 --> 00:32:54,007
- Get down.
Aah.

314
00:32:54,951 --> 00:32:57,977
I loved her, man.
I couldn't kill her.

315
00:32:57,977 --> 00:32:59,621
What's going on down there?

316
00:32:59,621 --> 00:33:01,120
I didn't do anything. Stop.

317
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,315
Shut up.

318
00:33:03,226 --> 00:33:05,694
- Get up.
- I didn't kill her. You know.

319
00:33:05,694 --> 00:33:08,763
- Shut the fuck up.
That's a roger, two-two.

320
00:33:12,202 --> 00:33:13,794
Get up.

321
00:33:15,372 --> 00:33:17,932
Call it in, code four.
Get him out of here.

322
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:21,506
Copy that, we have got a homicide.

323
00:33:22,212 --> 00:33:25,147
Code four.
Homicide suspect in custody.

324
00:33:25,649 --> 00:33:28,641
Nancy. You know.
You know who did it.

325
00:33:33,456 --> 00:33:35,014
Coming in.

326
00:33:36,826 --> 00:33:38,521
Open three.

327
00:33:39,329 --> 00:33:41,058
Clear.

328
00:33:41,058 --> 00:33:42,596
Clear four.

329
00:33:42,596 --> 00:33:44,996
- Let him out.
All right.

330
00:33:46,102 --> 00:33:48,570
Hold five open.

331
00:33:52,342 --> 00:33:53,434
Open four.

332
00:34:30,947 --> 00:34:33,245
Hello?
- Hi, it's Nancy.

333
00:34:33,245 --> 00:34:34,644
Hey.

334
00:34:34,644 --> 00:34:38,083
You said to call
you if I needed to talk.

335
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:42,017
- Yeah.
- Kris is dead.

336
00:34:46,663 --> 00:34:48,597
Stay awake.

337
00:34:48,597 --> 00:34:52,064
- Stay awake.
- Quiet.

338
00:34:58,074 --> 00:35:00,838
Shut the fuck up.

339
00:35:17,727 --> 00:35:20,059
That will be $24.97.

340
00:36:12,515 --> 00:36:17,452
Five, four, three, two...

341
00:36:27,597 --> 00:36:30,157
Five, six, seven...

342
00:37:00,396 --> 00:37:01,693
Nightmares?

343
00:37:04,801 --> 00:37:05,825
Yeah.

344
00:37:08,538 --> 00:37:09,903
Freddy?

345
00:37:12,475 --> 00:37:13,635
Open four.

346
00:37:16,946 --> 00:37:18,379
Get up.

347
00:37:18,379 --> 00:37:20,948
Folks posted your bail.

348
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:56,243
Jesse, help me.

349
00:37:58,121 --> 00:38:00,351
Help me, please.

350
00:39:04,921 --> 00:39:06,752
Kris?

351
00:39:12,929 --> 00:39:15,454
- Oh, God.
- No.

352
00:39:15,865 --> 00:39:17,958
Just me.

353
00:39:20,904 --> 00:39:23,099
What do you want from me?

354
00:39:23,306 --> 00:39:25,137
Hmm. I don't know, Jesse.

355
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:27,505
You think you can turn back time?

356
00:39:28,845 --> 00:39:30,142
- Answer me.
- No.

357
00:39:30,142 --> 00:39:32,577
Do you think you can
bring the dead back to life?

358
00:39:32,577 --> 00:39:34,444
- No. No.
- No?

359
00:39:35,184 --> 00:39:37,175
I didn't fucking think so.

360
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,879
No. No. No.

361
00:39:40,456 --> 00:39:45,860
Why are you screaming?
I haven't even cut you yet.

362
00:40:24,934 --> 00:40:27,494
I didn't do it. I am innocent.

363
00:40:27,494 --> 00:40:30,366
Get me out of here.

364
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,335
Let me the fuck out of here.

365
00:40:36,346 --> 00:40:40,180
Did you know
that after the heart stops beating...

366
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,342
...the brain keeps functioning
for well over seven minutes?

367
00:40:45,088 --> 00:40:49,047
We got six more minutes to play.

368
00:40:56,733 --> 00:41:00,760
- You okay?
- Yeah. I am just really exhausted.

369
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,564
Here.

370
00:41:08,911 --> 00:41:10,776
- What's that?
- ZoneraI.

371
00:41:12,115 --> 00:41:16,518
It's basically speed for kids with ADD.
I have been on it since I was, like, 15.

372
00:41:16,518 --> 00:41:18,654
No. No. No, thanks.

373
00:41:18,654 --> 00:41:22,279
Nancy, look, you're running on fumes.
Here, okay? Are you sure? It's-

374
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:24,824
Yeah, I am fine for now.

375
00:41:31,167 --> 00:41:33,727
I didn't take you for the religious type.

376
00:41:34,137 --> 00:41:37,163
Yeah, well, you got to believe
in something, you know?

377
00:41:40,977 --> 00:41:43,002
What's this one doing here?

378
00:41:43,002 --> 00:41:45,613
It's The Pied Piper of Hamelin.

379
00:41:45,613 --> 00:41:47,528
I saw it in one of my dreams.

380
00:41:47,528 --> 00:41:49,274
It's a story about a guy
who's betrayed by a town...

381
00:41:49,274 --> 00:41:52,216
...and he gets his revenge
by taking all their children.

382
00:41:52,655 --> 00:41:54,748
I keep dreaming about children too.

383
00:41:54,748 --> 00:41:57,449
And then there's also a school.

384
00:41:58,294 --> 00:42:00,524
Well, it's got to mean something.

385
00:42:00,524 --> 00:42:04,723
Yeah, but, I mean, what? We didn't go to
school together until, like 6th grade.

386
00:42:05,501 --> 00:42:08,493
- Look, we're running out of time.
- What do you mean?

387
00:42:10,606 --> 00:42:12,306
Well it says, nightmares
are triggered by the belief

388
00:42:12,306 --> 00:42:14,007
that the dreamer has no control...

389
00:42:14,007 --> 00:42:15,667
...and this can cause insomnia.

390
00:42:16,446 --> 00:42:18,277
But then it says at the 70-hour mark...

391
00:42:18,277 --> 00:42:20,882
...the insomniac will begin
to experience micronaps.

392
00:42:21,651 --> 00:42:23,482
"His brain will begin to
shut down its functions

393
00:42:23,482 --> 00:42:25,314
for several seconds in an
attempt to recharge itself."

394
00:42:25,314 --> 00:42:29,049
This basically means that you're
dreaming, but you don't know it.

395
00:42:29,049 --> 00:42:31,887
Like, even if you're awake.

396
00:42:31,887 --> 00:42:34,109
And then it says that after that,

397
00:42:34,109 --> 00:42:36,157
your brain will shut
down, inducing a coma.

398
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:38,630
Which is permanent sleep.

399
00:42:50,913 --> 00:42:51,633
Nancy?

400
00:42:55,418 --> 00:42:56,138
Nancy?

401
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:01,410
Nancy.

402
00:43:23,613 --> 00:43:24,773
Yeah?

403
00:43:27,116 --> 00:43:28,208
Hey.

404
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:31,043
Hey.

405
00:43:31,988 --> 00:43:33,615
Where have you been?

406
00:43:33,615 --> 00:43:35,916
I was at the bookstore.

407
00:43:36,826 --> 00:43:39,021
Okay, well,
I didn't know where you were.

408
00:43:39,529 --> 00:43:43,192
And I just feeI like, with everything
that's been happening with your friends-

409
00:43:43,192 --> 00:43:44,924
Hey, Mom?

410
00:43:44,924 --> 00:43:47,831
Do I have some sort of connection
with Kris...

411
00:43:47,831 --> 00:43:50,131
...and Dean and Jesse?

412
00:43:50,131 --> 00:43:52,035
Or Quentin?

413
00:43:52,035 --> 00:43:56,338
Like, maybe we went to school together
when we were little or something like that?

414
00:43:57,914 --> 00:43:59,575
Not that I can recall.

415
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:02,578
Did we ever know a guy named Freddy?

416
00:44:04,754 --> 00:44:06,881
I don't think so.

417
00:44:12,628 --> 00:44:14,289
Okay.

418
00:44:22,638 --> 00:44:24,367
Good night.

419
00:44:25,641 --> 00:44:27,404
Good night.

420
00:44:45,728 --> 00:44:47,923
Hey, it's Gwen.

421
00:44:49,699 --> 00:44:51,530
Nancy's starting to remember.

422
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:55,552
Honey, you okay?

423
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:57,696
Yeah, I am fine, Mom.

424
00:45:57,696 --> 00:46:01,424
- All right. I am going to bed.
- Okay.

425
00:47:23,182 --> 00:47:25,673
Little Nancy.

426
00:47:27,019 --> 00:47:29,249
All grown up.

427
00:47:29,249 --> 00:47:31,356
You're just a nightmare.

428
00:47:31,356 --> 00:47:33,424
That's right.

429
00:47:33,424 --> 00:47:36,789
No one can prove I was ever here.

430
00:47:37,063 --> 00:47:38,894
Who are you?

431
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,469
You don't remember?

432
00:47:45,771 --> 00:47:47,204
You must.

433
00:47:49,442 --> 00:47:51,672
You're my number one.

434
00:47:53,846 --> 00:47:56,007
You're my...

435
00:47:56,916 --> 00:48:00,352
...little Nancy.

436
00:48:03,322 --> 00:48:05,153
I set an alarm.

437
00:48:05,153 --> 00:48:07,349
Yes, you did.

438
00:48:07,349 --> 00:48:09,426
In your dream.

439
00:48:12,531 --> 00:48:14,328
You smell different.

440
00:48:22,675 --> 00:48:23,801
Quentin?

441
00:48:23,801 --> 00:48:26,001
Nancy, he got to him. Jesse's dead.

442
00:48:26,412 --> 00:48:28,505
He died in his sleep.

443
00:48:28,814 --> 00:48:30,509
I saw him.

444
00:48:30,509 --> 00:48:34,380
- I fell asleep. I saw Freddy.
- All right, I am coming over.

445
00:48:35,221 --> 00:48:36,950
Okay.

446
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:50,034
Shit.

447
00:48:59,111 --> 00:49:00,373
So Badham's a pre-school.

448
00:49:00,373 --> 00:49:03,413
It's on the other end of town.
It was closed years ago.

449
00:49:03,413 --> 00:49:05,948
Can't find any pictures.

450
00:49:06,552 --> 00:49:08,417
Wait, come here.

451
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:13,018
I drew this after my dream.

452
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:21,224
I don't know.
I have never seen it before.

453
00:49:22,601 --> 00:49:26,002
How is the guy in our dreams
connected to the school?

454
00:49:26,002 --> 00:49:28,003
I don't know.

455
00:49:30,743 --> 00:49:32,802
But I know my mom's hiding something.

456
00:49:40,453 --> 00:49:41,579
There's nothing here.

457
00:49:48,661 --> 00:49:50,288
Help me.

458
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,231
What is that?

459
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,488
We're all here.

460
00:50:18,457 --> 00:50:19,651
Kris, Jesse, Dean.

461
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,360
It's me, it's you, it's-

462
00:50:28,968 --> 00:50:31,198
What are you doing?

463
00:50:31,637 --> 00:50:32,865
What are you doing?

464
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:36,137
Nancy, what is going on?

465
00:50:36,542 --> 00:50:39,340
- Give me the picture.
- I don't understand.

466
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:44,347
You said that..... You said that
we didn't know each other.

467
00:50:44,683 --> 00:50:47,345
But we're all in this picture.
We went to school together.

468
00:50:47,345 --> 00:50:49,545
Give me the picture.

469
00:50:50,222 --> 00:50:52,019
- It's okay.
- Why would you lie to me?

470
00:50:52,019 --> 00:50:55,649
I didn't lie. It's right here.
Why would you lie to me?

471
00:50:55,649 --> 00:50:58,353
- Stop lying. You're lying to me.
- I am not lying to you.

472
00:50:58,353 --> 00:51:01,159
- Stop lying to me.
- I am not lying to you.

473
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:04,530
I didn't want you to have to go
through your life with this memory.

474
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:08,264
I didn't want you to remember.
I wanted you to forget.

475
00:51:08,264 --> 00:51:10,101
Remember what?

476
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:17,207
What happened at that pre-school?

477
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,816
Smile, everybody.

478
00:51:20,816 --> 00:51:22,851
You guys look great.

479
00:51:22,851 --> 00:51:28,050
There was a man at the pre-school.

480
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:30,422
His name was Fred Krueger.

481
00:51:31,263 --> 00:51:32,696
<i>One, two</i>

482
00:51:32,696 --> 00:51:34,799
<i>Freddy's coming for you</i>

483
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,294
<i>Three, four
Better lock your door</i>

484
00:51:38,294 --> 00:51:40,267
He was a gardener.

485
00:51:41,574 --> 00:51:44,372
He lived in the basement
of the pre-school...

486
00:51:44,372 --> 00:51:47,706
...and you kids were his life.

487
00:51:51,517 --> 00:51:53,144
Four...

488
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:55,248
...three...

489
00:51:55,248 --> 00:51:56,718
...two...

490
00:51:57,222 --> 00:51:58,484
...one.

491
00:51:58,484 --> 00:52:00,318
We didn't want to believe it at first.

492
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:02,585
Ready or not...

493
00:52:03,062 --> 00:52:04,962
You all were so innocent.

494
00:52:04,962 --> 00:52:07,223
...here I come.

495
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,664
And you, Nancy...

496
00:52:10,402 --> 00:52:13,064
What are you drawing? That is so good.

497
00:52:13,064 --> 00:52:14,705
...you were his favorite of all.

498
00:52:14,705 --> 00:52:17,103
You know what?
I got some other drawings.

499
00:52:17,103 --> 00:52:18,959
And they're, like, really bad drawings.

500
00:52:18,959 --> 00:52:20,643
Maybe you can help me fix them?

501
00:52:20,643 --> 00:52:22,804
And then we started to notice things.

502
00:52:29,388 --> 00:52:32,789
Yeah. Uh, he has been acting
a little strange lately.

503
00:52:32,789 --> 00:52:36,917
He takes us to the secret cave.

504
00:52:39,398 --> 00:52:41,127
It's okay. It's all right.

505
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,861
So, what did you do?
Did you call the police?

506
00:52:43,861 --> 00:52:47,995
He left town before we ever
were able to confront him.

507
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:51,207
He's gone. He can't hurt you anymore.

508
00:52:51,207 --> 00:52:53,675
So these dreams that you're having...

509
00:52:55,014 --> 00:52:58,074
...they're repressed memories...

510
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:01,883
...from a terrible, terrible time.

511
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:04,856
I hope that you're right.

512
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:10,525
We have to find the other kids
in the picture.

513
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:13,694
- What are you talking about? No.
- Quentin, it doesn't make any sense.

514
00:53:13,694 --> 00:53:16,892
There's got to be more to it. It's not...
This makes total sense, ok.

515
00:53:16,892 --> 00:53:19,128
You heard what your mom said.
These are just fucked up memories.

516
00:53:19,128 --> 00:53:21,568
- What if she's wrong?
- We're experiencing them...

517
00:53:21,568 --> 00:53:23,270
We're living them, but
they're just memories.

518
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:24,800
How do you know that?

519
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,207
Memories don't kill you.

520
00:53:33,986 --> 00:53:38,184
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Quentin, get in
the car. It's my dad. I got to go.

521
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:41,152
- We have to do something.
- Look, stop.

522
00:53:41,152 --> 00:53:42,918
This is crazy. Listen to yourself.

523
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,795
I am sorry.

524
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:06,646
I want you to do 400 warm-up.
Then do a 200-back-breast drill swim.

525
00:54:06,646 --> 00:54:09,913
Quentin, I need you to focus.
I need you to wake up and get into this.

526
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,989
Let's go. All right, guys.

527
00:54:11,989 --> 00:54:14,717
Step up. Let's go. On the blocks.

528
00:54:18,163 --> 00:54:20,290
Take your mark.

529
00:55:11,083 --> 00:55:13,074
Make sure you're working
your underwaters...

530
00:55:13,074 --> 00:55:15,152
...hit the turns,
in and out really quick.

531
00:55:15,152 --> 00:55:17,288
Powerful dolphins off the wall.

532
00:55:17,288 --> 00:55:21,916
All right, guys, we're going to do eight 300s,
descend one to four, hold five to eight.

533
00:55:21,916 --> 00:55:25,530
All right, hop out.
On the blocks, guys. Let's go.

534
00:55:29,268 --> 00:55:30,599
Let's step up.

535
00:55:32,638 --> 00:55:34,765
Take your mark.

536
00:55:40,546 --> 00:55:42,309
Come on, pick it up.
Let's go. Come on.

537
00:55:42,309 --> 00:55:45,814
Come on. Come on,
let's go. Attaboy.

538
00:55:49,321 --> 00:55:51,551
Come on, now. Come on.
Come on, let's go.

539
00:55:52,791 --> 00:55:54,725
Come on.

540
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,157
Come on.

541
00:56:34,299 --> 00:56:35,960
Wait.

542
00:56:41,907 --> 00:56:42,999
Hey.

543
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:06,963
Okay.

544
00:57:06,963 --> 00:57:10,533
Krueger.
Come on out, you bastard.

545
00:57:20,579 --> 00:57:23,275
God damn it.
You open this door, Krueger.

546
00:57:23,275 --> 00:57:24,540
What do you think I did?

547
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:28,117
I didn't do anything. Get your
ass out. Open the fucking door.

548
00:57:28,117 --> 00:57:29,948
- I didn't do it.
Norm, make sure...

549
00:57:29,948 --> 00:57:33,114
..... he can't get out the back.
Okay.

550
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:38,595
Stop.

551
00:57:38,595 --> 00:57:41,790
Stop. Okay.

552
00:57:46,538 --> 00:57:49,166
Okay. Okay.

553
00:57:57,783 --> 00:58:00,752
What are you doing? No, no, no.
This isn't the right way.

554
00:58:00,752 --> 00:58:03,183
- We got to call the police.
- What is the right way?

555
00:58:03,183 --> 00:58:06,381
Our kids get on a stand,
tell a room of people what happened?

556
00:58:06,381 --> 00:58:08,685
- No, we have got to call the police.
- He's right.

557
00:58:08,685 --> 00:58:11,260
- This is not the way to do this.
This ends tonight.

558
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:24,432
Okay. Okay.

559
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:31,542
This is for my son.

560
00:58:40,425 --> 00:58:41,449
Come out, Krueger.

561
00:59:11,823 --> 00:59:12,949
No.

562
00:59:18,597 --> 00:59:19,859
Are you okay?

563
00:59:22,734 --> 00:59:24,201
Go get the nurse.

564
00:59:24,201 --> 00:59:27,202
Breathe, breathe.
Come on. Come on, breathe.

565
00:59:27,202 --> 00:59:29,602
Relax and breathe. Come on. Come on.
I am okay.

566
00:59:49,327 --> 00:59:51,989
I had another nightmare last night.

567
00:59:52,531 --> 00:59:57,559
That burned man with the striped
sweater, he keeps trying to kill me.

568
00:59:57,559 --> 01:00:00,967
I ran a different way this time.
I ended up in front of a pre-school.

569
01:00:00,967 --> 01:00:03,169
I woke up before I had
a chance to explore,

570
01:00:03,169 --> 01:00:05,200
but it has to mean something.

571
01:00:07,112 --> 01:00:09,876
He chased me
into the pre-school this time.

572
01:00:09,876 --> 01:00:12,278
I got away,
made it down to the basement.

573
01:00:12,278 --> 01:00:15,318
But it feels like that's
where he wants me to go. Like...

574
01:00:15,318 --> 01:00:17,455
...he needs me to find something.

575
01:00:20,058 --> 01:00:22,322
I am starting to dream
with my eyes open.

576
01:00:22,322 --> 01:00:24,826
I can't tell what's real anymore.

577
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:27,723
I haven't slept in three days.

578
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:31,797
If I sleep, I dream.

579
01:00:31,797 --> 01:00:34,598
If I dream, I am dead.

580
01:00:35,607 --> 01:00:39,202
Is there anybody else out there
that this is happening to?

581
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:42,972
Can somebody help me?

582
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,172
Please?

583
01:01:06,738 --> 01:01:08,035
They're all dead.

584
01:01:08,035 --> 01:01:09,935
I know what happened to Freddy.

585
01:01:13,612 --> 01:01:14,670
You killed Krueger.

586
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:18,341
- Where'd you hear that name?
- You chased him...

587
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:21,077
...cornered him and burned him
to death. You hunted him.

588
01:01:21,077 --> 01:01:23,517
We did not hunt him.
We were protecting you.

589
01:01:23,517 --> 01:01:26,179
- From what?
- From him. From what he did to you.

590
01:01:26,179 --> 01:01:28,241
From what you kids
told us he did to you.

591
01:01:28,241 --> 01:01:30,124
We were 5. We would have
said anything.

592
01:01:31,129 --> 01:01:33,563
- Why didn't you go to the police?
- You were so young.

593
01:01:33,563 --> 01:01:36,360
No. God.
And the things we said he did...

594
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:39,629
The cave. Did you ever find it?

595
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:40,379
No.

596
01:01:43,542 --> 01:01:46,067
How do you know he was guilty?

597
01:01:46,711 --> 01:01:49,339
- Oh, my God.
- You killed an innocent man.

598
01:01:49,339 --> 01:01:50,572
Mm-mm.

599
01:01:50,572 --> 01:01:52,529
There's not a day that goes by that

600
01:01:52,529 --> 01:01:54,310
I don't think about that night,
Quentin.

601
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:56,477
Good, you deserve at least that.

602
01:01:56,477 --> 01:02:01,183
Quentin. When you grow up
and you have kids...

603
01:02:01,183 --> 01:02:04,692
...I hope you never know the feeling
of utterly failing to protect them.

604
01:02:04,692 --> 01:02:06,990
- Don't touch me.
- Son.

605
01:02:17,242 --> 01:02:18,607
You listen to me.

606
01:02:18,944 --> 01:02:21,094
As far as everyone around here

607
01:02:21,094 --> 01:02:23,244
is concerned, Fred
Krueger never existed.

608
01:02:27,252 --> 01:02:28,685
Quentin.

609
01:02:29,688 --> 01:02:31,588
Quentin, wait. Wait.

610
01:02:31,588 --> 01:02:33,986
- What?
- Slow down.

611
01:02:34,526 --> 01:02:35,754
- Stop.
- We got him killed.

612
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:38,554
Our stories, our lies.

613
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:40,857
- What if we can make him stop?
- What if we can?

614
01:02:40,857 --> 01:02:44,160
The pre-school. Marcus said that
Freddy wanted him to find something.

615
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,894
Fine.

616
01:02:47,872 --> 01:02:49,737
Nancy.

617
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:03,776
Don't you want to hang out, Nancy?

618
01:03:16,201 --> 01:03:18,032
What are you doing?

619
01:03:19,638 --> 01:03:22,698
I just saw Kris in a body bag.

620
01:03:24,776 --> 01:03:26,835
All right,
you have been up for too long.

621
01:03:26,835 --> 01:03:28,980
You're having micronaps.
We got to go.

622
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:31,342
Let's go find the pre-school.

623
01:03:37,956 --> 01:03:39,287
What are we doing here?

624
01:03:39,758 --> 01:03:41,658
I need more pills.

625
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:04,540
Come on. Come on.

626
01:04:19,164 --> 01:04:24,534
Hi. Um, I am going to need a, um,
refill on that, please.

627
01:04:25,937 --> 01:04:27,962
On this, you're out of refills.

628
01:04:29,774 --> 01:04:32,334
I am going to have to
call the doctor on this.

629
01:04:32,334 --> 01:04:36,071
Look, I don't have time
to call a doctor. Look-

630
01:04:37,015 --> 01:04:39,040
Oh, my God.

631
01:04:57,335 --> 01:05:00,532
Look, I have been on this stuff
since I was 15.

632
01:05:00,532 --> 01:05:01,797
Okay? It's totally fine.

633
01:05:01,797 --> 01:05:04,908
You just go back, you fill it up and-
Even just a couple.

634
01:05:04,908 --> 01:05:07,340
- All I need is a couple.
- No. No, I am sorry.

635
01:05:26,264 --> 01:05:28,698
<i>When I want you</i>

636
01:05:29,501 --> 01:05:32,368
<i>In my arms
When I want you</i>

637
01:05:32,368 --> 01:05:35,563
Quentin. Quentin.

638
01:05:37,041 --> 01:05:39,168
- Just fill it up.
- No.

639
01:05:43,381 --> 01:05:44,643
<i>Dream, dream, dream</i>

640
01:05:44,643 --> 01:05:45,874
Quentin.

641
01:05:45,874 --> 01:05:50,214
<i>When I feel blue
In the night</i>

642
01:05:50,214 --> 01:05:55,087
<i>And I need you
To hold me tight</i>

643
01:05:55,087 --> 01:06:01,961
<i>Whenever I want you
All I have to do is dream</i>

644
01:06:37,001 --> 01:06:38,366
No. No.

645
01:06:47,979 --> 01:06:49,503
Wake up.

646
01:06:49,503 --> 01:06:51,615
You're bleeding.

647
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:57,784
Oh, my God. What happened?

648
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:01,821
Hang on.

649
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,653
His sweater.

650
01:07:04,653 --> 01:07:06,023
- Okay.
- He's here.

651
01:07:07,432 --> 01:07:09,832
Man, you're hurt really bad.

652
01:07:11,870 --> 01:07:14,862
Let's go to the hospital. Come on.

653
01:07:19,511 --> 01:07:22,036
Dr. Blake Mason to ICU, please.

654
01:07:30,955 --> 01:07:32,513
Baby.

655
01:07:33,324 --> 01:07:35,918
Oh, honey, honey, honey,
what happened?

656
01:07:36,327 --> 01:07:37,919
Who did this to you?

657
01:07:37,919 --> 01:07:39,825
Look at it, Mom. You know who did it.

658
01:07:42,901 --> 01:07:44,061
You know who did it.

659
01:07:44,061 --> 01:07:46,032
Oh, honey.

660
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:52,569
Dr. Zeger. Dr. William Zeger to CCU.

661
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:56,373
Dr. Zeger. Dr. Zeger to CCU.

662
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:05,418
Okay, how we doing?

663
01:08:05,418 --> 01:08:07,285
It's going to be okay.

664
01:08:07,285 --> 01:08:10,916
I am going to give you
a little something for the pain.

665
01:08:10,916 --> 01:08:14,030
- It will put you right out.
- It's okay.

666
01:08:14,432 --> 01:08:17,128
No, Mom, I don't want it.
I don't want it. I don't want it.

667
01:08:17,128 --> 01:08:18,997
- It's okay, it's okay.
- No, Mom, no.

668
01:08:18,997 --> 01:08:22,537
- I don't want it. Don't let her do it.
- This might sting a bit.

669
01:08:22,537 --> 01:08:24,265
- No. No.
No, no.

670
01:08:24,265 --> 01:08:25,932
- Okay. Okay.
- No.

671
01:08:25,932 --> 01:08:28,874
- Where's Quentin?
- Can I have a word with you in the hall?

672
01:08:29,414 --> 01:08:32,781
Don't leave. Don't leave, Mom. Mom.

673
01:08:32,781 --> 01:08:34,748
Where's Quentin? I need Quentin.

674
01:08:37,555 --> 01:08:40,353
Your daughter needs to be sedated,
but I can't do anything...

675
01:08:40,353 --> 01:08:43,961
...... without your authorization.
- I just want her to be out of pain.

676
01:08:43,961 --> 01:08:45,618
Good. Sign this.

677
01:08:53,771 --> 01:08:55,568
She will be fine.

678
01:09:08,252 --> 01:09:09,913
Great.

679
01:09:28,272 --> 01:09:29,432
Thank you.

680
01:09:29,432 --> 01:09:31,268
- You okay?
- Yeah.

681
01:09:31,268 --> 01:09:33,501
- Yeah?
- What is that?

682
01:09:33,911 --> 01:09:37,108
- Adrenaline. Keep us awake.
- Where'd you get it?

683
01:09:37,108 --> 01:09:39,146
I stole it off one of
the nurse's carts.

684
01:09:40,284 --> 01:09:42,912
You can't take that. You have no
idea what it's going to do to you.

685
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:45,351
You know what?
That is kind of the least

686
01:09:45,351 --> 01:09:47,615
of my concerns right
now. So, you want some?

687
01:09:47,959 --> 01:09:48,709
No.

688
01:09:54,332 --> 01:09:55,526
Whoa.

689
01:09:56,934 --> 01:09:58,026
Are you okay?

690
01:10:01,539 --> 01:10:03,700
Yeah. I am good.

691
01:10:04,175 --> 01:10:05,574
Let's go.

692
01:10:08,546 --> 01:10:11,447
How much further?
We're almost there.

693
01:10:11,683 --> 01:10:14,243
Hey, will you talk to me?
I am falling asleep.

694
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:17,349
Yeah. What do you want to talk about?

695
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:21,387
I don't know.

696
01:10:21,793 --> 01:10:23,055
What's your favorite color?

697
01:10:25,697 --> 01:10:27,392
Blue.

698
01:10:35,073 --> 01:10:38,406
Look, if you really want to talk,
how come over the last couple years...

699
01:10:38,406 --> 01:10:41,807
...every time I have invited you out,
you have just never shown up?

700
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:46,211
I don't know if you have noticed,
but I don't exactly fit in.

701
01:10:51,255 --> 01:10:53,951
Okay, look,
if we survive the next 24 hours...

702
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:56,787
...then I will take you out
on a real date.

703
01:11:00,565 --> 01:11:02,624
Well, what if I say no?

704
01:11:03,835 --> 01:11:05,928
Well, why don't you sleep on it?

705
01:11:20,752 --> 01:11:23,277
You okay?
- I am fine.

706
01:11:24,388 --> 01:11:25,980
Come on.

707
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,151
I saw him. He was right there.

708
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:34,730
We got to go. Come on.

709
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:51,043
This is it.

710
01:11:52,316 --> 01:11:54,443
This is the school.

711
01:12:27,952 --> 01:12:29,112
- No.
Heh-heh-heh.

712
01:12:29,112 --> 01:12:30,481
Are you okay?

713
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:35,483
I don't know what's real anymore.

714
01:12:35,893 --> 01:12:37,520
Come on.

715
01:12:38,529 --> 01:12:40,292
Follow me.

716
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,990
Hey, give me your lighter.

717
01:13:19,704 --> 01:13:22,264
All right, well, now that we're here,
now what?

718
01:13:22,974 --> 01:13:25,374
Because I don't remember any of this.

719
01:13:30,348 --> 01:13:31,372
This must be his room.

720
01:13:33,384 --> 01:13:36,182
Okay, he brought us here for a reason.

721
01:13:37,622 --> 01:13:40,591
This is definitely his room.

722
01:13:56,207 --> 01:13:57,538
Quentin.

723
01:14:10,221 --> 01:14:13,713
- What?
- There's something back there.

724
01:14:54,665 --> 01:14:56,189
I have been here before.

725
01:14:56,667 --> 01:15:00,433
If you can keep a secret,
I will take you to a special place.

726
01:16:07,371 --> 01:16:08,395
What are those?

727
01:16:11,675 --> 01:16:13,700
What are those pictures of?

728
01:16:14,945 --> 01:16:16,435
They're all of you.

729
01:16:18,916 --> 01:16:20,850
- Let me see.
- No.

730
01:16:31,829 --> 01:16:32,579
No.

731
01:16:36,534 --> 01:16:38,434
Oh, God.

732
01:16:39,236 --> 01:16:39,986
No.

733
01:16:44,542 --> 01:16:45,668
We were wrong.

734
01:16:46,644 --> 01:16:49,738
He's not after us because we lied.

735
01:16:52,283 --> 01:16:55,218
He's after us because we told the truth.

736
01:16:56,287 --> 01:16:59,723
He brought us here so we would
remember what he did to us.

737
01:17:01,092 --> 01:17:02,787
God. Fuck.

738
01:17:06,530 --> 01:17:08,191
Fuck.

739
01:17:10,868 --> 01:17:13,962
What does he want from us?
He's never going to stop.

740
01:17:23,481 --> 01:17:25,142
I know what we need to do.

741
01:17:25,983 --> 01:17:27,678
Come on.

742
01:17:33,557 --> 01:17:34,956
There's got to be another way.

743
01:17:34,956 --> 01:17:37,754
If we just sit here and do nothing,
we're going to die.

744
01:17:39,029 --> 01:17:42,863
I should do this.
I am the one who pulled his sweater out.

745
01:17:43,534 --> 01:17:46,230
What if I am the only one
who can bring him out?

746
01:17:49,273 --> 01:17:52,709
Nancy, I can't let you go to sleep.
You're not going to wake up.

747
01:17:52,709 --> 01:17:55,209
I know you won't let that happen.

748
01:17:58,849 --> 01:18:00,646
Wake me up if you see me struggle.

749
01:18:16,233 --> 01:18:19,066
got to believe in something, right?

750
01:18:29,113 --> 01:18:30,944
I am going to be here when you get up.

751
01:18:31,815 --> 01:18:33,646
We're going to make it.

752
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:17,817
Aw, shit.

753
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:44,874
You can't save her.

754
01:20:49,053 --> 01:20:50,850
Tag.

755
01:20:51,955 --> 01:20:53,616
You're it.

756
01:20:57,361 --> 01:20:59,158
Krueger.

757
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:02,664
Your girlfriend's here.
I will be right back.

758
01:21:07,771 --> 01:21:09,739
One, two

759
01:21:09,739 --> 01:21:13,638
Guess who's coming for you

760
01:21:18,382 --> 01:21:20,077
Little Nancy.

761
01:21:20,077 --> 01:21:23,310
Now that you caught me,
what game do you want to play next?

762
01:21:23,310 --> 01:21:26,422
- Fuck you.
- Ooh. Sounds like fun.

763
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:28,853
It's a little fast for me.

764
01:21:31,628 --> 01:21:32,993
How about we hang first?

765
01:21:36,033 --> 01:21:38,968
No. It's not real.

766
01:21:42,172 --> 01:21:43,662
It's real.

767
01:21:45,509 --> 01:21:47,101
I am real.

768
01:22:48,772 --> 01:22:49,796
Boo.

769
01:23:12,229 --> 01:23:14,663
Now, how's this for a wet dream?

770
01:24:00,611 --> 01:24:02,636
Quentin, wake me up.

771
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:06,913
This dress...

772
01:24:08,552 --> 01:24:11,146
...was always one of my favorites.

773
01:24:12,189 --> 01:24:15,249
Do you remember it, Nancy?

774
01:24:16,326 --> 01:24:18,487
Of course you do.

775
01:24:19,263 --> 01:24:23,097
You remember everything now,
don't you?

776
01:24:25,369 --> 01:24:28,065
Your memories are what fuels me.

777
01:24:29,573 --> 01:24:31,905
No. Please don't.

778
01:24:33,243 --> 01:24:36,371
Your mouth says no...

779
01:24:36,747 --> 01:24:39,875
...but your body says yes.

780
01:24:40,951 --> 01:24:42,043
Mmm.

781
01:24:42,386 --> 01:24:43,910
Don't turn away.

782
01:24:43,910 --> 01:24:45,281
Look at me.

783
01:24:48,358 --> 01:24:50,451
Look what you did to me.

784
01:24:55,866 --> 01:24:59,267
Now it's time to play.

785
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:11,645
Are you having fun?

786
01:25:19,323 --> 01:25:20,950
Naughty girl.

787
01:25:26,964 --> 01:25:28,329
You can't hurt me.

788
01:25:28,966 --> 01:25:31,161
You're in my world.

789
01:25:34,404 --> 01:25:35,962
And you can't ever leave.

790
01:25:47,017 --> 01:25:48,211
Ohh...

791
01:25:49,386 --> 01:25:51,911
That's music to my ears.

792
01:25:51,911 --> 01:25:54,751
I want to wake up.

793
01:25:54,751 --> 01:25:56,517
You can't wake up.

794
01:25:56,517 --> 01:26:01,756
I had to keep you awake long enough
so when you finally slept...

795
01:26:03,734 --> 01:26:05,793
...you'd never wake up again.

796
01:26:07,904 --> 01:26:09,872
Nancy, wake up.

797
01:26:09,872 --> 01:26:11,632
Wake up, Nancy, wake up.

798
01:26:11,632 --> 01:26:14,436
We're going to be in here a long time.

799
01:26:15,779 --> 01:26:18,304
- Nancy, please.
- Did you really think your boyfriend...

800
01:26:18,304 --> 01:26:21,280
..... could wake you up?
- Please, don't do this.

801
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:23,214
Please.

802
01:26:23,214 --> 01:26:25,617
I am your boyfriend now.

803
01:26:27,224 --> 01:26:30,125
Nancy, come back. Please, wake up.

804
01:26:30,125 --> 01:26:31,817
You promised.

805
01:26:43,707 --> 01:26:45,368
Sweet dreams.

806
01:26:59,122 --> 01:27:00,350
Quentin, get him.

807
01:27:14,337 --> 01:27:17,602
Die. Fucking bastard.

808
01:27:22,946 --> 01:27:24,345
Nice try, Nancy.

809
01:27:24,345 --> 01:27:26,175
Now let me take a stab.

810
01:27:38,962 --> 01:27:42,864
Now, why don't you just fucking die?

811
01:27:50,273 --> 01:27:52,241
It hurts, doesn't it?

812
01:27:52,241 --> 01:27:54,468
That's because you're
in my world now, bitch.

813
01:28:28,078 --> 01:28:29,670
Wait.

814
01:29:06,283 --> 01:29:09,844
Give me some slack.
Yeah, aim it up a little higher.

815
01:29:11,488 --> 01:29:12,819
No sign of a body anywhere.

816
01:29:38,281 --> 01:29:40,306
Hey, Quentin.

817
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:45,684
Nightmare's over.

818
01:30:10,580 --> 01:30:13,105
I want you to go
straight up to bed, okay?

819
01:30:13,105 --> 01:30:14,807
Yeah.

820
01:30:18,722 --> 01:30:20,417
Hey, Mom?

821
01:30:21,324 --> 01:30:25,420
I know you were just trying
to protect me. Thank you.

822
01:30:27,697 --> 01:30:28,925
I am just glad you're safe.
