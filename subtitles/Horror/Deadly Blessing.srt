1
00:01:56,784 --> 00:02:01,412
[male] In the rolling hills
of a simple farm community

2
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:05,041
untouched by time,

3
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,293
a gruesome secret

4
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,629
has been protected

5
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,839
for generations.

6
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:38,116
[motor starts up]

7
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:53,923
Hey!

8
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:08,437
- I brought you a surprise.
- A surprise, huh?

9
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,731
I love you.

10
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:44,307
Faith stowaway often at this farm.

11
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:47,393
Oh! Get away from me,
William Gluntz.

12
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,896
Ugly, Hittite pig brain.

13
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,404
- Stop it, Gluntz!
- Incubus.

14
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,364
You retard!

15
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,119
[Gluntz] Incubus.

16
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,914
- [girl yells]
- Servant of the incubus.

17
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,373
Ma!

18
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,264
William, William!

19
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,809
Hell fire to the incubus!

20
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,478
Hell fire to you, Hittite!

21
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,438
Get back where you belong, William.

22
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,107
You're gonna be
in trouble with Isaiah.

23
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,734
Infidel.

24
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,375
He chasin' you again?

25
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,336
He broke my paints, Ma.

26
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,338
I'll get ya some more.

27
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,757
Get on back home, Faith.

28
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:01,842
Go on.

29
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,886
You, know, uh...

30
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:06,305
William never really hurt anybody.

31
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,015
Tell that to Faith.

32
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,102
Every time she comes near that place

33
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:13,938
that Gluntz idiot starts chasin' her

34
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:17,149
like he was some kinda
guard dog or somethin'!

35
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:22,738
Of course, I know it ain't nothin'
you can help.

36
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,950
Well, you tell her
she's welcome over here.

37
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,703
Well, I like her at home.

38
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,247
Out of people's hair.

39
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,000
Anyways, you have my thanks.

40
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,670
Okay, in a while we'll be calling
on you for somethin'.

41
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,966
You do midwifin', don'tcha?

42
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:44,468
Hey,

43
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,305
don't say... when?

44
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:49,807
It won't be until spring sometime.

45
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,560
Well, I hope it's a girl.

46
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,272
Boys ain't nothin' but trouble.

47
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,400
Incubus!

48
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,154
She incubus!

49
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,994
Whoa.

50
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,175
Uh!

51
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,843
Ow.

52
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:30,181
We have no use
for that kind of machinery.

53
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,683
So do not covet what he has.

54
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,643
He is dead.

55
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:35,686
Do you understand?

56
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,564
Yes, Father, I understand.

57
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,778
I'm sorry.

58
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:36,539
Damn it.

59
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,960
Damn, damn, damn, damn!

60
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:44,880
[female] Faith?

61
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,634
Faith!

62
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,814
You hear me callin' you?

63
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,441
Dinner's ready.

64
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:06,402
Sorry, Lou, I guess I'm just too busy
thinkin' about what I'm doin'.

65
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,488
I think...

66
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:12,074
I think girls should...

67
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,369
paint their nails.

68
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:19,081
Not stuff like this.

69
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,459
Lots a girls paint, Momma.

70
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,043
There ain't no shame to it.

71
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,714
Wait 'til you see the next one
I'm gonna do.

72
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:30,092
It's gonna be my masterpiece,
that's all.

73
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,270
[male] Martha, what are you up to?

74
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,362
What's this?

75
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:54,492
Thanks... for the best anniversary
I've had so far.

76
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:57,244
It's not surprising
since it's our first.

77
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,789
New manure spreader?

78
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,416
Portable.

79
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,001
We'll save the bow.

80
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,308
Already we're history, right?

81
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,105
Nice suit. [chuckles]

82
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:28,067
Poppa knew this would happen
if he let me go off.

83
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,401
Glad you went anyway?

84
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:33,822
Glad your stuck out in the country
with your crazy Hittite?

85
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,824
Ex Hittite.

86
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,291
What's wrong?

87
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,254
Oh, just a little, uh, trouble
with the tractor.

88
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,964
I pulled the wheels off.

89
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,925
I may go out and pack
the bearings a little later.

90
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,220
You're a little bombed, no?

91
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,639
- Poo.
- Who's bombed?

92
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,559
Besides, isn't there...

93
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:07,106
Isn't there anything else you can do
tonight except pack bearings?

94
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,401
Hmm?

95
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,355
[dog barks]

96
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,656
[door creaks]

97
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,422
[dog barks]

98
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,578
[tractor starts]

99
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,932
[motor stops]

100
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,989
[chicken cackles]

101
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,075
[cackles]

102
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,930
[tractor starts]

103
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,351
What the hell are you...

104
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,520
Jim?

105
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:32,806
You in here?

106
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:00,876
[gasps]

107
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,085
[cries out]

108
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,381
Jim, Jim?

109
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,627
Ain't no need for you to wait
any longer, Mam.

110
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,173
I'll stay 'til you're through.

111
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,864
They usually do that
when one of their own dies.

112
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,492
Funny.

113
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,204
He kin to them?

114
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:25,585
Kin.

115
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,143
Evil one is among us.

116
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:19,765
Do you believe she calls
and tells us not to come?

117
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,476
That's Martha.
Turn here.

118
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:30,317
I never thought
she'd isolate herself so much.

119
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:38,366
[sighs] Who are these Hittites anyway,
Amish or what?

120
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,951
No, no connection.

121
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:43,246
According to Martha, the Hittites make
the Amish look like swingers.

122
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,315
Ain't no way we're gonna
get in there.

123
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,109
There's always a way,
if you want one.

124
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:25,080
Will, you gonna do it?

125
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,374
Or are you afraid your girlfriend's
gonna come around and catch ya?

126
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,416
Ain't my girlfriend.

127
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,044
Nah, you just come around
and peek in her window.

128
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:34,047
Watch it.

129
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,590
Okay.

130
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,976
Father Isaiah said this place
was with the incubus.

131
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:47,018
If he knew...

132
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,896
Now who's chickens?

133
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,041
You get blue, you just call me.

134
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:16,756
I'm sorry that it... it took this for us
to get to know each other

135
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,091
a little better.

136
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:21,970
- Thanks.
- It's nothin'.

137
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,626
Wow, big as a house.

138
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:54,461
I gonna look.

139
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,718
- Dare you to touch the blood.
- Dare you.

140
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,470
Double dare goes first.

141
00:21:56,524 --> 00:22:04,524
[chickens cackle]

142
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,682
[yells]

143
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,892
Honey, we thought you heard us.

144
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:39,024
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

145
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:53,288
[cackling]

146
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,382
[dog barks]

147
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,890
[female] Do you have a clear deed
to this place?

148
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,975
Did Jim leave a will?

149
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:17,228
Jim was very careful.

150
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,856
He'd just inherited this farm

151
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:24,152
when he got into a big fight
with his father, Isaiah.

152
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:26,237
Well, what happened, anyway?

153
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,574
Jim was the first Hittite
to go away to school...

154
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:30,950
to the city.

155
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,328
Isaiah was furious to begin with.

156
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,915
And then when Jim
came back with me...

157
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,168
Isaiah kicked him out
of the family.

158
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,837
He forbid anyone
to even talk with us.

159
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:45,548
Called me the incubus.

160
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,176
What's an incubus?

161
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:51,846
Some sort of a devil

162
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,932
that seduces the faithful
in his sleep.

163
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:57,227
Or it just comes after you
and takes you like a beast.

164
00:23:57,228 --> 00:23:58,812
Oh, God.

165
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,109
It's been an awful shock.

166
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:07,195
You'll feel better
when we get you back to L.A.

167
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,698
I'm not going anywhere
at least until spring.

168
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:15,745
Just stay with me for a week
and I'll be all right.

169
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,915
I love you both.

170
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:23,378
To old friends.

171
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,424
You know what the cost
of a shoe is?

172
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,343
I was fetchin' the calves to feed.

173
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:31,594
Caught in the mud.

174
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,054
My foot was stuck in mud

175
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,390
and when I pulled it out
my shoe came off.

176
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:43,022
There is no mud
on the shoe you have.

177
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,527
I washed it, so...

178
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,906
More than the cost of the shoe
is the cost of the lie.

179
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,745
I will go get it.

180
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,914
- If I could find it.
- You will find it.

181
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,584
If it takes all night.

182
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,503
And while you are searching,

183
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,631
keep in mind the wages of sin!

184
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:06,619
Whoa.

185
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,998
Matthew,

186
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,376
it is best I speak to this one.

187
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:47,243
Yes?

188
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:51,956
I have come only to speak
for one of my people.

189
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,332
[Matthew] It's my boy.

190
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,585
He went out yesterday.

191
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:03,843
He lost one of his shoes
and I told him to go find it.

192
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:05,386
But he never returned.

193
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:07,221
I've asked everyone.

194
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,348
Have you seen him?

195
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,017
William?

196
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:13,603
- The big boy?
- Oh, yes.

197
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:16,647
This must have been yesterday...
in the evening maybe.

198
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,899
I'm sorry.

199
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,777
If... if you see him...

200
00:30:20,778 --> 00:30:22,987
If I see him, I'll drive him by.

201
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,655
Where's your farm?

202
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,824
- By the river, just by the...
- Matthew, Matthew,

203
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,245
you see how the glib
serpent's tongue deceives you?

204
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:35,833
Would you put your son
in her ungodly machine?

205
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:38,628
If it would bring him home.

206
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:40,087
She is with incubus.

207
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:43,341
She could not speak the truth
if she knew it.

208
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:48,471
Go.

209
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:50,681
Wait by the wagon.

210
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:53,559
I will have one more word with her.

211
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:09,408
If you should see
the boy before me,

212
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,993
I am the elder.

213
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,332
One more word.

214
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,920
I, too, have lost a son.

215
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:25,007
I am certain in my heart

216
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,969
he would want this land
to stay with his people.

217
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,055
His people.

218
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:34,016
His people turned
their backs on him.

219
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,059
You ordered it.

220
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:41,107
Our people are prepared
to offer a good price.

221
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:43,943
A very good price.

222
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:47,864
You want your answer right away?

223
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:49,699
If you like.

224
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:05,172
May you be damned in hell!

225
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:27,147
[Martha] I shouldn't have let him
get to me like that.

226
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,698
If I owned a piece of property
like this and I kicked the bucket,

227
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:33,910
my parents would start building condos
on it on the way home from the funeral.

228
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,412
Lana!

229
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:37,705
Chow!

230
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,833
Stop shouting, I'm up.

231
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:42,209
Yeah.

232
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,296
How's the champ?

233
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,798
I'm fine.

234
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,551
Vicky's done everything but
inject me with chicken soup. [chuckles]

235
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:53,012
- How are you?
- I'm okay.

236
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:55,431
You're up before noon.
You must be sick.

237
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,725
Just couldn't sleep, that's all.

238
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:59,727
And when I finally did
get to sleep, I...

239
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,647
I had this really awful nightmare.

240
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:05,191
I dreamed about this man

241
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:09,320
whose skin was all gray like ash.

242
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,656
Came to my door and...
This house?

243
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:15,993
No, just... just a house in a dream.

244
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,205
Anyway, he came
and he banged on the door.

245
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,084
And he just said my name...

246
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:25,127
[whispers] real quiet.

247
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:28,798
"Lana, Lana..."

248
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,508
Lana, what a bummer you can be.

249
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,971
Well, then I took this big cannon
and I aimed it right at the door

250
00:33:34,972 --> 00:33:36,555
And it didn't go off, naturally.

251
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,015
No, it did.

252
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:41,560
But when the smoke cleared...

253
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,731
he was still there.

254
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:49,694
Just... changed.

255
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:51,904
How did he change?

256
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,075
He'd...

257
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,162
He'd become a spider.

258
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,168
He...

259
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,796
He whispered my name again.

260
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:13,467
[whispers] But this time
right in front of my face.

261
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,637
Said it like a lover would say it.

262
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:20,099
[whispers] "Lana."

263
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,311
I woke up in a cold sweat.

264
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,818
It's a cold room.

265
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,611
I should have put you in with Vicky.

266
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:37,408
I'm so pissed off at you,
Lana Marcus.

267
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,868
Well, we came here
to cheer up Martha,

268
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:41,120
not make her so depressed
that she wants to blow her brains out.

269
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:43,039
God, you're right, I'm sorry.

270
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,123
It's okay.

271
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:47,460
You can choose to look at the shadows
or you can choose to look at the light.

272
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:49,795
- [gasps and screams]
- Jesus.

273
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,505
I'm sorry.

274
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,965
I didn't mean to peek.

275
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,342
Can I come in?

276
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,014
Look how many I brought you.

277
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,016
They're all grade A large too.

278
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:03,642
And we'll never miss 'em.

279
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,227
Fact, I'm sick a eggs.

280
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,562
I really am.

281
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:07,897
It's eggs this, eggs that.

282
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:10,066
Sometimes I'd rather eat dirt.

283
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:12,068
Here, these are for you.

284
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:14,820
Now, don't you worry
'cause I candled all of them.

285
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,614
There ain't gonna be
no little beady eyes

286
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,824
staring up at you
outta your sunny-side ups.

287
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,076
Uh, terrific.

288
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,789
You're Louisa Stohler's daughter,
right?

289
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,625
Mm-hmm, I'm Faith.

290
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:30,669
F-A-I-T-H, like in believe.

291
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:34,757
Faith, uh, this is Lana and Vicky.

292
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:36,509
And I'm Martha.

293
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,968
It's nice to meet you all.

294
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,180
You're not a Hittite, are you?

295
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:42,723
No, I ain't a Hittite.

296
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,124
And don't ever say that,
I hate 'em.

297
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,185
We ain't even farmers.

298
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:47,978
Ma's a waitress.

299
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,772
Oh, those damn Hittites.

300
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:53,025
All they done is try to run us outta
here like they done everybody else.

301
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:54,819
My momma won't budge.

302
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,947
Just like you don't, Martha.

303
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:05,287
Well, gotta scoot.

304
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,665
I'll bring ya some more eggs real soon.

305
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,835
That's fine, but we have plenty now.

306
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:12,419
Oh it's... it's no trouble.

307
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,466
Okay, you bring 'em.

308
00:36:18,552 --> 00:36:20,386
Boy, I bet you miss him a lot, huh?

309
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,722
I had a pet once.

310
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:26,058
It was just this dumb old bird
with a broken wing.

311
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,811
Next thing I knew he was dead.

312
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:32,898
Cried and cried for him all night.

313
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,733
Just like I would for a brother.

314
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:38,988
I know how it is.

315
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,995
Please don't do that.

316
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:55,379
I like your room a lot.

317
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,964
It's real nice.

318
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,843
Are, uh... are those two visitors?

319
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,304
They'll be stayin' a while.

320
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:04,763
Oh.

321
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:11,604
Come on, gang.

322
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:17,776
Come on, I'll beat you to the wagon.

323
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,508
[growls]

324
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,347
Hey.

325
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,017
Hey!

326
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,268
Hey is this...

327
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,023
[yelps]

328
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,162
[horse blows]

329
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,959
Hi.

330
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,253
Where is your red car?

331
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:19,630
How'd you know I had a red car?

332
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:22,841
I saw it yesterday on the road.

333
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:25,177
By Jim's farm.

334
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:26,804
You know Jim?

335
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,180
Martha's Jim?

336
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,183
Jim was my brother.

337
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,395
Oh, I'm sorry.

338
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,814
Don't be sorry.

339
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:39,191
We rejoice for the dead.

00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:41,527
Hey, they are in a better place.

[horse blows]

344
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:04,591
You didn't think he was
so terrible, did you?

345
00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:08,387
My father shunned him
for leaving the way.

346
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,143
What my father says
will always be the law.

347
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,981
But he was my brother.

348
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,571
Well, I guess I better go.

349
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,327
Why?

350
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,680
I feel like I've been
through a time warp.

351
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,684
There's no cars, no jets.

352
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,063
No telephone poles
or power lines.

353
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,654
What is a warp?

354
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:16,080
That's when somebody
from the 20th century

355
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:18,082
wakes up one morning

back in the 18th century.

357
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,926
This century's more peaceful, I think.

358
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:32,638
Really.

You do not work?

No. I mean yes, Father.

364
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,846
Something troubled you?

365
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:17,391
- No, Father.
- We were just talking, sir.

366
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:19,476
These things are not for us.

367
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,686
John.

368
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,148
You'll be working now, ya?

We are the kindred of God.

We have no business
with the serpents.

Yes, Father.

Your cousin is a sound woman.

You are to shun the rest.

Yeah, in the barn.

He was touched.

You didn't have to hurt him.

Mr. Gluntz, you don't think
I killed William?

You want me to find
who did that or not?

We already know who did this.

00:49:56,202 --> 00:49:58,495
- Who?
- The incubus.

Your laws cannot crush the incubus.

I'll come back with you tomorrow
and get your things.

434
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:26,890
Meanwhile, I'll get a court order
and look at that body.

435
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:30,151
You want me to run

00:59:55,968 --> 00:59:57,635
And the wages of sin

503
00:59:58,178 --> 00:59:59,303
are death!

504
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:38,134
Leopold Smith step forward.

505
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:51,689
Leopold Smith, kneel

506
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:54,650
and confess thy wrongdoing.

507
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:57,153
I went into the forbidden barn.

508
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:01,866
I... have shamed us all.

509
01:01:03,619 --> 01:01:05,369
And more.

510
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:08,998
It was me who dared him
to go into the barn.

511
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,794
I humbly ask God for forgiveness.

512
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:15,880
[sobs]

513
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:19,008
We shall make it impossible

514
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:25,348
for the incubus to rest comfortably
in your soul.

515
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:28,851
One we have lost.

516
01:01:29,728 --> 01:01:32,104
Another shall we save.

517
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:34,815
[congregation] Amen.

518
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:20,152
If thine eye offends thee,

519
01:02:21,363 --> 01:02:22,947
pluck it out.

520
01:02:24,366 --> 01:02:27,410
If thine hand offends thee,

521
01:02:28,787 --> 01:02:32,957
then in God's name cut it off!

522
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:49,473
Is that usual,
snakes coming into houses?

523
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:50,808
Oh, it happens enough.

524
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,397
Morning, Mrs. Schmidt.

525
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:57,690
Morning, Sammy.

526
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:05,030
Fill the tank and this.
Okay, Stretch?

527
01:03:05,866 --> 01:03:07,950
- Coming?
- Yeah, in a minute.

528
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:10,411
I've just got some business
in here I gotta take care of.

529
01:03:10,412 --> 01:03:13,748
I think I'll, uh, get a lot of...

530
01:03:13,749 --> 01:03:15,708
about ten lbs. of chocolate.

531
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:16,959
What do you think?

532
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,461
Used to work every time.

[horse neighs]

534
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:23,257
Hey, uh, you want me
to come over with you?

535
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:24,300
Just wait a sec.

536
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:26,260
That's okay,
I'm not afraid a Hittites.

537
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,179
At least, not all of them.

538
01:03:36,772 --> 01:03:38,230
That one is good.

539
01:03:42,277 --> 01:03:43,694
This one is proper.

540
01:03:44,446 --> 01:03:45,738
You think?

541
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,492
Whatever you like, Melissa.

542
01:03:54,873 --> 01:03:56,332
[cash register rings]

543
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:10,095
Why don't you surprise me?

544
01:04:10,931 --> 01:04:12,932
I'll fetch the flour
while you choose.

545
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:23,818
[horse and buggy passes]

546
01:04:27,656 --> 01:04:29,336
[stutters]
About what happened yesterday...

547
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:33,314
We're really not that unfriendly.

548
01:04:34,329 --> 01:04:35,788
[whispers] Well.

549
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:37,665
Isaiah should not have
treated you that way.

550
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:38,958
That's all right.

551
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:41,293
I suppose, to your father,

552
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:45,339
jogging shorts and a t-shirt
make me a Jezebel.

553
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:52,137
You know about Jezebel?

554
01:04:53,557 --> 01:04:54,849
You wanna do somethin'
some time?

555
01:04:57,477 --> 01:04:59,812
Well, just a movie or something.

556
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:02,982
I think the one in town's
Lassie Meets Godzilla.

557
01:05:02,983 --> 01:05:04,400
Can't be sinful.

558
01:05:08,572 --> 01:05:10,281
And nobody will know.

559
01:05:15,203 --> 01:05:16,453
I knew it.

560
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:23,335
Melissa, Melissa.

561
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:26,046

01:05:27,215 --> 01:05:28,757
I'm sorry.

Melissa.

564
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:35,139
Say it.

565
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:40,978
She's prettier than I am.

566
01:05:40,979 --> 01:05:42,396
She's not.

567
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:45,024
No.

568
01:05:45,025 --> 01:05:46,400
Swear it.

569
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:51,864
I'll never talk to her again.

570
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:55,159
I was weak.

571
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:00,289
It's just hard waiting.

572
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,502
You better take me home.

573
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:08,714
It's you I want, not her.

574
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:12,843
I can't.

575

01:06:40,914 --> 01:06:42,122
What's that for?

579
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,167
What are you up to?

580
01:06:47,087 --> 01:06:48,712
Oh, my God.

581
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:50,547
What, has war been declared
or what?

582
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:52,841
Where did you get that thing?

583
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:55,010
Got it from Sammy
back at Coopers Junction.

584
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,679
Oh, [chuckles] Stretch.

585
01:06:57,806 --> 01:07:00,641
Anyway, uh, I told him
about the snake

586
01:07:00,642 --> 01:07:04,645
and, uh, also told him
I was an old hand at this.

587
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:06,563
Here.

No.

590
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,320
No?
Oh, good grief.

591
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:18,575
Well... doesn't take an Einstein
to pull a trigger.

592
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:20,035
See that green bottle right there?

593
01:07:22,998 --> 01:07:24,373
Oh, God.

594
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:28,877
- Oh, I'm deaf.
- What?

595
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:32,214
I got it, though.

596
01:07:32,215 --> 01:07:33,298
Here.

[sighs]

598
01:07:40,682 --> 01:07:42,642
You don't think it would have
bounced off, do you?

599
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,229
Wait a minute.

600
01:07:48,815 --> 01:07:50,524
What are you aiming at?

601
01:07:50,525 --> 01:07:51,942
Paint can.

602
01:07:51,943 --> 01:07:53,902
Not gonna to take any chances.

603
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:57,865
It's just about the size
of a man's chest.

01:08:26,603 --> 01:08:27,686
Who did this?

608
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:46,205
You will follow me to the barn.

609
01:08:46,206 --> 01:08:48,290
- But Father...
- Obey!

610
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:08,560
I need to talk.

611
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:11,438
You need the fear
of God in thee.

01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:13,398
- Kneel.
- Father...

613
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:14,650
Kneel!

01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:42,761
No!

616
01:09:45,974 --> 01:09:47,266
You're cursed.

617
01:09:51,813 --> 01:09:53,522
No more.

Please.

01:09:55,150 --> 01:09:55,650
Go!

You are a stench
in the nostrils of God!

The devil has you now!

01:10:11,291 --> 01:10:13,917
Melissa, come with me
and we'll talk.

623
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:16,461
She is too pure
to hear the devil.

624
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:19,756
All our hearts and ears
are stone to you now.

625
01:10:20,884 --> 01:10:23,093
Your brother will not look at you.

626
01:10:23,094 --> 01:10:25,429
Your mother will never feed you again.

627
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:29,057
You are not of us now... go.

628
01:10:29,893 --> 01:10:31,977
Go to thy whore.

629
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:33,937
Go.

630
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:36,523
Join your brother in hell!

631
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:43,697
I gotta get out of the house
for a while.

632
01:10:43,698 --> 01:10:44,865
You'll be okay?

633
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:45,949
We're fine.

634
01:10:46,534 --> 01:10:48,035
[sighs] Okay.

635
01:10:50,038 --> 01:10:51,288
Get outta here.

636
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:52,623
All right.

637
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:55,751
- Bye.
- Bye.

638
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:57,461
Stay outta trouble.

639
01:10:57,462 --> 01:10:59,087
I always try.

640
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:02,799
[clunk] [knocking]

641
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:08,764
Who is it?

642
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:10,390
Louisa Stohler.

643
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:20,901
Hi, Louisa.

644
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:22,778
Can I come in?

645
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:24,154
Oh, sure.

646
01:11:24,155 --> 01:11:25,280
Sorry.

647
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:29,243
Left your hat in my truck.

648
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:31,912
- Oh, thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

649
01:11:32,247 --> 01:11:34,039
Come on in.

650
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,123
Thanks.

651
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:37,376
Louisa, this is my friend Lana.

652
01:11:37,377 --> 01:11:39,169
And Vicky you just missed.

653
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:41,421
Uh, pleased to make
your acquaintance, Lana.

654
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:42,547
Nice to meet you.

655
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:44,424
- Sit down.
- Oh, thanks.

656
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:46,051
Louisa's Faith's mother.

657
01:11:46,052 --> 01:11:47,844
- You remember Faith?
- Yeah.

658
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:50,389
Yeah, well, it's kinda hard
to forget her.

659
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:52,474
Once you've said hello,
she goes on so.

660
01:11:53,184 --> 01:11:54,935
And that's partly
why I come down.

661
01:11:54,936 --> 01:11:57,229
I thought maybe
she might a snuck down here.

662
01:11:57,981 --> 01:11:59,481
Started getting in your hair.

663
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:02,150
Well, she's been very generous
with the eggs.

664
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:05,404
So that's where they disappeared.

665
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:07,781
I'll go get the basket.

666
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:18,000
I'm sorry about all
the trouble down here.

667
01:12:24,257 --> 01:12:26,633
I don't suppose the sheriff's
been much good.

668
01:12:26,968 --> 01:12:30,429
No, as a matter of fact,
all he does is tell us to get out.

669
01:12:31,931 --> 01:12:34,641
Well, I wouldn't be surprised
if he was a Hittite hisself.

670
01:12:35,435 --> 01:12:37,436
Men around here is hopeless.

671
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:42,983
Well, I guess my old man
made me hate the whole breed.

672
01:12:43,818 --> 01:12:47,362
[sighs] Yeah, as soon as Faith was born
he was over the fence and gone.

673
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:51,575
I swear, if Faith had been a boy,

674
01:12:51,576 --> 01:12:55,329
I think I'd a just stuck her
in the river like sack a kittens.

675
01:12:57,915 --> 01:12:59,082
Here.

676
01:12:59,417 --> 01:13:01,960
Listen, I hope you don't scold Faith
for coming by.

677
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:03,420
No.

678
01:13:03,421 --> 01:13:05,130
No, there's nothing personal.

679
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:06,673
I just like to keep an eye on 'er.

680
01:13:06,674 --> 01:13:08,383
She's so dumb.

681
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:09,676
She couldn't pour piss
from a boot

682
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:11,470
if the instructions was printed
on the heel.

683
01:13:12,138 --> 01:13:13,347
Well.

684
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:17,309
Nice you came by.

685
01:13:19,312 --> 01:13:21,355
Watch the Hittites.

686
01:13:22,148 --> 01:13:23,440
[whispers] Watch 'em.

687
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:25,484
I mean, if you're gonna stay,

688
01:13:26,277 --> 01:13:27,235
you gotta watch 'em.

689
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:32,282
'Course, your Jim,

690
01:13:33,451 --> 01:13:34,868
he was different.

691
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:37,371
Bye.

692
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:57,182
Thank you.

693
01:14:23,918 --> 01:14:25,127
John?

694
01:14:26,421 --> 01:14:27,671
What are you doing here?

695
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:28,922
Huh.

696
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:30,841
You didn't drive your buggy
30 miles, did you?

697
01:14:32,135 --> 01:14:33,385
I hitched.

698
01:14:34,554 --> 01:14:35,679
Hiked and I hitched.

699
01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:42,894
What's wrong?

700
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:44,521
Something happened?

701
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:46,356
No.

702
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,734
It's just some trouble between
my father and me.

703
01:14:55,408 --> 01:14:56,491
Come on.

704
01:14:57,034 --> 01:14:58,118
I'll drive you back.

705
01:15:00,705 --> 01:15:01,955
We'll talk.

706
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:34,112
[gravelly voice] Lana.

707
01:15:44,123 --> 01:15:46,750
Open your mouth.

708
01:15:50,046 --> 01:15:50,546
Wider.

709
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:10,482
[coughing, gasps]

710
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:13,109
Hey.

711
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:14,361
You all right?

712
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:21,993
Just a... bad dream.

713
01:16:23,996 --> 01:16:26,498
Something got in my throat.

714
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,000
[sighs] Scare you?

715
01:16:30,294 --> 01:16:32,128
What, who me?

716
01:16:34,632 --> 01:16:36,174
I knew it.

717
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:39,177
You're just as scared as I am.

718
01:16:40,304 --> 01:16:42,180
It's all a big front.

719
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:43,557
Just look at you.

720
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,267
You're shaking.

721
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:47,811
I'm not scared.

722
01:16:48,187 --> 01:16:49,938
It's just...

723
01:16:49,939 --> 01:16:51,022
Just what?

724
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,525
Well, it's just there's a draft
in here or something.

725
01:17:35,610 --> 01:17:37,402
[female screams]

726
01:17:37,403 --> 01:17:39,904
[Rod Stewart sings "Maggie May"
on the radio]

727
01:17:51,042 --> 01:17:53,918
[gears grind]

728
01:17:59,050 --> 01:18:00,592
This is wonderful.

729
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:02,218
This is much better
than a horse.

730
01:18:02,553 --> 01:18:05,096
It's much better to even try it,
don't you think?

731
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:09,142
Thanks for listening.

732
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:11,353
Whoa!

733
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:20,153
Oh, close, but no cigar.

734
01:18:20,154 --> 01:18:21,905
I guess I'm not so good a driver.

735
01:18:21,906 --> 01:18:24,741
You kidding?
For your first time, you did great.

736
01:18:24,742 --> 01:18:27,661
Well, wh... what is it you do
to start it running again?

737
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:30,330
What's your hurry?

738
01:18:33,167 --> 01:18:34,417
Huh?

739
01:18:35,670 --> 01:18:36,878
Oh.

740
01:18:39,882 --> 01:18:41,299
Is this, uh...

741
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:44,761
Is this where we say
we've run out of gas?

742
01:18:45,471 --> 01:18:47,013
Could.

743
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:03,947
John!

744
01:19:32,268 --> 01:19:33,643
John.

745
01:19:56,917 --> 01:19:59,252
[distant howl]

746
01:20:00,713 --> 01:20:01,796
What?

747
01:20:03,591 --> 01:20:05,383
Something I did?

748
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:07,927
No, I just thought
I saw something out there.

749
01:20:11,599 --> 01:20:13,308
There's nothing out there.

750
01:20:14,685 --> 01:20:16,519
Everyone around here
goes to bed by dark.

751
01:20:21,692 --> 01:20:23,026
[snap]

752
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:29,908
That's probably
a raccoon or opossum.

753
01:20:30,993 --> 01:20:32,452
Maybe we should go.

754
01:20:32,453 --> 01:20:34,093
Not at all, I'll go...
I'll chase it away.

755
01:20:35,790 --> 01:20:38,249
- John, don't.
- Don't worry.

756
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:07,445
[whispers] John!

757
01:21:17,164 --> 01:21:18,581
Did you see anything?

758
01:21:18,582 --> 01:21:19,958
Only ghosts and goblins.

759
01:21:25,256 --> 01:21:26,756
[kissing]

760
01:21:41,772 --> 01:21:43,356

761
01:21:54,785 --> 01:21:55,869
John.

[whispers] John.

763
01:22:03,836 --> 01:22:05,169
No!

764
01:23:34,969 --> 01:23:36,886
Don't worry,
she'll be home soon.

765
01:23:38,973 --> 01:23:42,850
Even when we were in college
I used to sit up like a mother hen.

766
01:23:45,312 --> 01:23:47,271
Hey, how 'bout
let me fix you a snack?

767
01:23:49,692 --> 01:23:51,776
Peanut butter and jelly sandwich
might be nice.

768
01:23:52,236 --> 01:23:53,820
Big glass of milk?

769
01:23:53,821 --> 01:23:55,822
Okay, you got it.

770
01:24:21,098 --> 01:24:22,932
Hey, would you like this on toast?

771
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,934
No.

772
01:24:26,478 --> 01:24:27,687
Oh!

773
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:32,775
Lana?

774
01:24:40,367 --> 01:24:43,745
Lana, listen, stop it.

775
01:24:46,248 --> 01:24:48,750
Oh, he did this to me.

776
01:24:50,836 --> 01:24:52,670
Someone's idea of a joke, maybe.

777
01:24:52,671 --> 01:24:54,797
Just don't freak out on me,
come on.

778
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:02,680
It's no use.

779
01:25:03,682 --> 01:25:05,433
You can't lock him out.

780
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:07,518
He comes in whenever he wants.

781
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:08,728
What are you talking about?

782
01:25:08,729 --> 01:25:09,771
Death.

783
01:25:09,772 --> 01:25:11,439
He's after me.

784
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,066
Jesus, Lana.

785
01:25:13,067 --> 01:25:14,609
Just get a hold a yourself.

786
01:25:16,070 --> 01:25:17,403
He tried to get me in the barn.

787
01:25:17,404 --> 01:25:19,197
Martha, I saw him.

788
01:25:19,198 --> 01:25:20,865
I wasn't dreaming.

789
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:23,910
Please don't do this.

790
01:25:23,911 --> 01:25:26,621
He spoke to me
like in my dream.

791
01:25:27,289 --> 01:25:31,042
Just reaches out
and touches your...

792
01:25:31,043 --> 01:25:32,251
Don't!

793
01:25:34,713 --> 01:25:36,380
Just go sit down.

794
01:25:38,008 --> 01:25:40,301
I'm going to go into the bedroom

795
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:42,053
and check the windows.

796
01:25:42,930 --> 01:25:44,972
For what,

797
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:47,308
if there's nothing
to be afraid of?

798
01:25:49,478 --> 01:25:51,646
Go sit down.

799
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:36,899
Jim.

Resurrection in the century

I wouldn't a hurt you.

825

I only hurt the ones
that were keeping us apart.

[screaming]

827

I tried to be a little girl, Lou.

01:31:42,456 --> 01:31:44,248
I tried so hard.

829
01:31:45,625 --> 01:31:47,293
I ain't got no secret no more.

830

Not if she lives.

Tried to kill her, didn't ya?

832
01:31:53,717 --> 01:31:55,801
You put the snake after her.

833
01:31:57,012 --> 01:31:59,096
Hey, listen,

Yeah, yeah, she could tell.

837
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:07,980
She could tell that you were...
that you was half and half.

838
01:32:07,981 --> 01:32:09,565
She laughed at you.

839
01:32:09,566 --> 01:32:11,775
She laughed and laughed
and laughed at you!

840
01:32:11,776 --> 01:32:13,486
No, she did not, my Martha.

841
01:32:13,487 --> 01:32:14,570
She's not yours!

842
01:32:15,363 --> 01:32:17,114
She can't be, never will be.

843
01:32:18,283 --> 01:32:20,159
She's carrying his child.

844
01:32:21,161 --> 01:32:22,953
You ain't never gonna
have her... never.

845
01:32:43,141 --> 01:32:44,475
Lana?

846
01:32:49,689 --> 01:32:50,981
- Lana.
- What?

847
01:32:50,982 --> 01:32:52,274
Get up quick.

848
01:32:52,275 --> 01:32:53,609
- What?
- Give me the gun.

849
01:32:53,610 --> 01:32:55,027
Come on.

850
01:32:55,028 --> 01:32:56,320
Why?

851
01:32:56,738 --> 01:32:58,072
Gotta get out.

852
01:33:01,576 --> 01:33:02,826
Where are we going?

853
01:33:03,495 --> 01:33:04,537
To the truck.

854
01:33:07,958 --> 01:33:09,959
It's him, it's him!

855
01:33:13,797 --> 01:33:15,339
Get off!

856
01:33:16,132 --> 01:33:17,424
Uh!

857
01:33:18,677 --> 01:33:19,635
I'm sorry.

858
01:33:20,387 --> 01:33:21,720
[gunshot]

859
01:33:48,623 --> 01:33:49,665
Operator.

860
01:33:49,666 --> 01:33:52,334
Operator, this is an emergency.
I've gotta keep...

861
01:36:04,134 --> 01:36:05,592
[horse whinnies]

862
01:36:06,344 --> 01:36:08,470
[wagon wheels rolling]

863
01:36:20,817 --> 01:36:21,817
[screams]

864
01:36:22,819 --> 01:36:23,861
[groans and screams]

865
01:36:40,253 --> 01:36:41,545
Melissa.

866
01:36:45,717 --> 01:36:47,968
Messenger of the incubus is dead.

867
01:37:12,619 --> 01:37:14,411
Sure you don't want
to come back with me?

868
01:37:17,081 --> 01:37:18,665
The seed's planted.

869
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
I stay.

870
01:37:30,136 --> 01:37:31,261
Bye.

871
01:37:40,563 --> 01:37:42,064
[car starts]

872
01:38:25,316 --> 01:38:26,692
[whispers] Martha.

873
01:38:36,828 --> 01:38:38,579
Beware.

874
01:38:43,918 --> 01:38:48,881
Beware of the incubus.

875
01:38:48,882 --> 01:38:50,257
Jim?

876
01:38:59,475 --> 01:39:02,227
[creaking from below]

877
01:39:06,107 --> 01:39:07,941
[howl]

878
01:39:54,739 --> 01:39:58,241
[male] The beast that thou sawest

879
01:39:58,242 --> 01:40:01,078
was and is not.

880
01:40:01,079 --> 01:40:05,499
And shall ascend
out of the bottomless pit

881
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:09,044
and go into perdition.

882
01:40:09,045 --> 01:40:13,215
And they that dwell
on the earth

883
01:40:13,216 --> 01:40:15,384
shall wonder.
