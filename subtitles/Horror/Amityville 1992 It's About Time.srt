00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,295
<i>Kill them. </i>

3
00:02:54,907 --> 00:02:57,034
What's wrong, Ronnie?

4
00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:02,974
I love you, Jodie.

5
00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:21,826
<i>Suffolk County police. </i>
<i>May I help you?</i>

6
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,524
<i>Everybody's dead. </i>

7
00:03:23,902 --> 00:03:25,665
<i>What do you mean,</i>
<i>"everybody's dead"?</i>

8
00:03:25,971 --> 00:03:27,905
<i>A guy come running</i>
<i>into the bar and says... </i>

9
00:03:28,073 --> 00:03:30,439
<i>... his mother and father are shot. </i>

10
00:03:30,642 --> 00:03:33,338
I've been to a lot of crime scenes,
never seen one like this.

11
00:03:33,512 --> 00:03:36,003
<i>Six members of the family</i>
<i>were found last night... </i>

12
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:39,214
...in bed, shot...

13
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:41,178
...and killed.

14
00:03:42,287 --> 00:03:45,950
<i>Killed were car dealer Ronald Defeo,</i>
<i>his wife and four of their children. </i>

15
00:03:46,124 --> 00:03:47,751
<i>The sole survivor of the family... </i>

16
00:03:47,926 --> 00:03:50,190
<i>... 23-year-old</i>
<i>Ronald "Butch" Defeo Jr... </i>

17
00:03:50,362 --> 00:03:52,262
<i>... is said to have discovered</i>
<i>the bodies. </i>

18
00:03:52,431 --> 00:03:54,422
<i>The police state</i>
<i>that for his own safety... </i>

19
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,761
<i>... they're holding him</i>
<i>in protective custody. </i>

20
00:03:56,935 --> 00:03:59,699
<i>Five of the victims were found</i>
<i>shot facedown on their beds. </i>

21
00:04:00,305 --> 00:04:02,034
The sixth was found in a closet.

22
00:04:03,942 --> 00:04:06,410
No one seemed to stir in their sleep.
It's strange.

23
00:04:06,578 --> 00:04:10,446
<i>Suffolk County police have charged</i>
<i>23-year-old Ronald Defeo Jr. </i>

24
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:12,607
<i>The accused told police</i>
<i>he heard voices... </i>

25
00:04:12,784 --> 00:04:16,083
<i>... coming from within the house,</i>
<i>telling him to murder his family. </i>

26
00:04:30,869 --> 00:04:32,860
Oh, God!

27
00:04:33,372 --> 00:04:34,896
Damn it.

28
00:04:44,216 --> 00:04:46,150
Hi, Michael.

29
00:04:46,485 --> 00:04:48,146
Oh, hey, baby. You okay?

30
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,311
George, what are you doing
to my mom?

31
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:52,715
Nothing.

32
00:04:52,891 --> 00:04:54,654
- Yet.
- You perv.

33
00:05:02,601 --> 00:05:04,728
Come on up here, little man.

34
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:10,872
You can make it.

35
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,540
Oh, you're getting heavy.

36
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,045
Did you meet my dad?

37
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,981
No...

38
00:05:23,221 --> 00:05:24,654
...never had the pleasure, pal.

39
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:27,819
Do I have to call you "Dad" now?

40
00:05:28,694 --> 00:05:30,321
- Guess what.
- What?

41
00:05:30,696 --> 00:05:33,392
- You can call me whatever you want.
- Anything?

42
00:05:33,565 --> 00:05:35,556
- Yep.
- Cool.

43
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:37,634
- Anything.
- Cool.

44
00:05:37,803 --> 00:05:39,430
Yeah.

45
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:41,903
- Stinky.
- Sure.

46
00:05:42,074 --> 00:05:43,632
- Poopy-head.
- Yeah.

47
00:05:43,809 --> 00:05:45,640
Crap-monkey-fart.

48
00:05:45,811 --> 00:05:49,110
Okay, we gotta draw the line
somewhere, pal, that does it.

49
00:05:54,653 --> 00:05:56,484
All right.

50
00:06:03,595 --> 00:06:05,722
- This sucks.
- You're not kidding.

51
00:06:05,897 --> 00:06:07,364
Billy.

52
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,768
Look, maybe we'll grab you
something on the way to school.

53
00:06:10,936 --> 00:06:13,905
- What do you say, huh?
- I'm not hungry. I can walk to school.

54
00:06:14,072 --> 00:06:16,632
No, you can't, and get
your feet off the chair.

55
00:06:17,242 --> 00:06:19,369
I'll drop you a couple blocks away.
Nobody'd see.

56
00:06:19,544 --> 00:06:21,512
- Mom, I'm 12 years old.
- Before you plan...

57
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,513
...your retirement party, we're gonna
drop you off at school.

58
00:06:24,683 --> 00:06:26,617
We got a big day.

59
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,778
Why? Where are you guys going?

60
00:06:31,523 --> 00:06:34,219
- Mom, can you help me?
- Oh, Michael.

61
00:06:39,197 --> 00:06:41,324
Houses here are way out
of our price range, Kath.

62
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,195
Not according to this.

63
00:06:43,368 --> 00:06:46,963
- Well, then it's gotta be true.
- Think positive, babe.

64
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:50,597
I'm positive that houses here
are out of our price range.

65
00:06:52,944 --> 00:06:54,775
Look, when the business
is going good...

66
00:06:54,946 --> 00:06:56,174
...we're gonna...
- There.

67
00:06:56,348 --> 00:06:57,576
- What?
- That's it.

68
00:06:58,216 --> 00:06:59,444
- Look.
- Honey.

69
00:06:59,618 --> 00:07:01,415
Baby, look, 412 Ocean Avenue.

70
00:07:07,826 --> 00:07:09,760
- It's beautiful.
- What?

71
00:07:25,811 --> 00:07:28,245
Look at how friendly they are here,
honey.

72
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:30,938
They get like that when they think
they'll make a sale.

73
00:07:31,116 --> 00:07:35,280
Let's just play it cool, Kath.
Kathy. Katherine.

74
00:07:35,987 --> 00:07:37,545
Or not.

75
00:07:45,063 --> 00:07:47,088
- Hi there.
- I'm Katherine Lutz.

76
00:07:47,265 --> 00:07:49,426
Well, just call me Edith.
This is your husband?

77
00:07:49,601 --> 00:07:52,069
- George.
- This is an amazing house.

78
00:07:52,237 --> 00:07:56,264
You are going to love it.
Just follow me in here.

79
00:07:57,175 --> 00:07:59,700
Careful on the steps there.

80
00:08:16,628 --> 00:08:19,722
Holy shit.

81
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:22,157
Excuse me.

82
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:24,700
Let me show you
the rest of the house.

83
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:27,904
This... This is a mistake.

84
00:08:28,073 --> 00:08:29,370
How's that?

85
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,702
No, I mean your ad in the paper.

86
00:08:32,978 --> 00:08:34,502
This is...

87
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,840
It's gotta be a misprint.
I'm a contractor...

88
00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:39,415
...and I know what a place
like this should cost.

89
00:08:39,584 --> 00:08:40,881
And, you know, if this is...

90
00:08:41,052 --> 00:08:44,681
Well, if this is true, then this is a...
The deal of a lifetime.

91
00:08:45,056 --> 00:08:47,217
And what is wrong with that?

92
00:08:48,126 --> 00:08:50,890
- Come on.
- I love it.

93
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:57,965
- There's a vibrant history here.
- Vibrant history, George.

94
00:08:58,136 --> 00:09:01,867
In fact, the house was built
in 1692, at least the basement.

95
00:09:02,407 --> 00:09:04,875
The rest of the house was added
from that foundation.

96
00:09:05,043 --> 00:09:07,534
It's one of the oldest Dutch Colonials
in Long Island.

97
00:09:07,712 --> 00:09:09,077
Wow, that's impressive.

98
00:09:09,247 --> 00:09:12,375
This room would be perfect
for children, if you have any.

99
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:16,612
And the view's...
Well, have a look for yourselves.

100
00:09:19,357 --> 00:09:20,984
There's a boathouse.

101
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:23,127
Oh, all you need now
is a boat, right?

102
00:09:23,295 --> 00:09:26,321
Actually, George has a speedboat.

103
00:09:26,898 --> 00:09:30,334
This place sounds
like it's made for you.

104
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:43,705
And this is your basement.

105
00:09:43,882 --> 00:09:47,045
As you can see,
it's very spacious.

106
00:09:47,218 --> 00:09:49,846
It can be a game room,
a playroom.

107
00:09:50,021 --> 00:09:51,852
Well, let's... Let's have a look.

108
00:09:57,662 --> 00:10:00,688
I'll just wait up here.

109
00:10:06,304 --> 00:10:08,534
Yep, looks like a basement.

110
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,731
So, what do you guys think?

111
00:10:10,909 --> 00:10:15,209
- I think you look foxy in that skirt.
- Will you stop it? Come on.

112
00:10:26,891 --> 00:10:29,018
Yes, yes, okay?

113
00:10:29,361 --> 00:10:32,353
It's a value. It's a value
for people with money.

114
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,624
Okay, look, if we do this, we're
gonna be eating dry wall for a year.

115
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,461
We deserve this, George.

116
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:39,729
You deserve this.

117
00:10:39,904 --> 00:10:42,600
How many times you tell me
how hard you work for so little.

118
00:10:42,774 --> 00:10:45,436
- Kathy...
- Maybe today is the day it all pays off.

119
00:10:46,244 --> 00:10:48,337
- We'll make sacrifices.
- Huge sacrifices.

120
00:10:48,513 --> 00:10:51,505
Yeah, I understand that.
Listen, honey...

121
00:10:51,683 --> 00:10:53,947
...this is the life we want.

122
00:11:09,534 --> 00:11:11,695
- We're happy?
- Yes, we're happy.

123
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,395
She's happy. I'm broke.

124
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:17,874
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

125
00:11:18,076 --> 00:11:22,308
So look, I gotta ask,
what's the catch?

126
00:11:23,448 --> 00:11:25,746
There's always a catch.

127
00:11:27,185 --> 00:11:31,679
There was a tragedy, a crime...

128
00:11:31,856 --> 00:11:34,586
...a murder.
- I'm sorry, what?

129
00:11:34,826 --> 00:11:36,691
In the house?

130
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:38,996
Several people, a family.

131
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:43,633
But, you know, we've moved on,
the whole town.

132
00:11:43,802 --> 00:11:46,498
It is a distant memory now.

133
00:11:47,272 --> 00:11:49,502
And the house is fine.

134
00:11:49,674 --> 00:11:51,198
Really.

135
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:54,037
Doesn't it seem kind of strange
to buy this house, honey?

136
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:56,407
Well, houses don't kill people.

137
00:11:56,648 --> 00:11:58,912
People kill people.

138
00:12:00,185 --> 00:12:03,211
Just... Excuse us.

139
00:12:04,823 --> 00:12:07,121
Do you think we can make it work?

140
00:12:12,564 --> 00:12:14,361
You know what?

141
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:17,962
You want it,
then we're gonna make it work.

142
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:20,297
- Really?
- I'll work out of the basement...

143
00:12:20,472 --> 00:12:22,269
...and you can, well...

144
00:12:23,241 --> 00:12:25,141
...sell one of the kids.
- Hey.

145
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,334
A little one.

146
00:12:42,293 --> 00:12:44,124
We're rich! We're rich!

147
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:47,393
We're rich in something,
but it ain't money.

148
00:12:49,934 --> 00:12:51,401
Wait.

149
00:13:32,277 --> 00:13:34,973
- You say your prayers?
- Yep, said them twice.

150
00:13:35,213 --> 00:13:38,979
- What did you pray for?
- Lf I tell you, it won't come true.

151
00:13:40,051 --> 00:13:41,814
Why don't you tell him the truth.

152
00:13:41,986 --> 00:13:44,477
- What?
- Praying doesn't do any good.

153
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:46,322
William.

154
00:13:46,524 --> 00:13:50,051
Nobody answered me when
I asked for Dad to be kept alive.

155
00:13:52,197 --> 00:13:54,165
Don't say that.

156
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,662
Sometimes things happen in life
that can't be explained, Billy.

157
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:09,371
Billy, look at me.

158
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,716
I need you to give George
a chance, okay?

159
00:14:14,819 --> 00:14:18,016
You're not being disloyal
to Dad by liking George.

160
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:22,018
He doesn't want to be anything
but your friend...

161
00:14:22,594 --> 00:14:24,425
...and maybe one day
something more.

162
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:28,055
Nobody will ever
replace your dad, honey.

163
00:14:30,535 --> 00:14:32,196
For you too?

164
00:14:32,971 --> 00:14:34,632
For me too.

165
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:51,817
How's Billy?

166
00:14:52,323 --> 00:14:53,984
He'll be fine.

167
00:14:55,426 --> 00:14:57,553
- First call.
- First call.

168
00:15:00,298 --> 00:15:03,790
- Lutz residence, how may I help you?
<i>- Can I talk to my daughter, please?</i>

169
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:08,300
Yeah, sure, she's...
She's right here. Okay.

170
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,234
Your mother's gotta stop
gushing over me, seriously.

171
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:13,343
It's embarrassing now.

172
00:15:13,878 --> 00:15:15,641
<i>Hello?</i>

173
00:15:16,414 --> 00:15:19,542
- Hey, Ma.
<i>- Hi. </i>

174
00:15:19,817 --> 00:15:22,047
No, we're all moved in.

175
00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:26,316
- Yeah, Ma.
- Are you cold?

176
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:30,390
No, Ma.

177
00:15:31,262 --> 00:15:32,126
Yeah.

178
00:17:37,321 --> 00:17:40,415
- What is it, baby?
- Nothing.

179
00:17:42,126 --> 00:17:45,152
- Are you okay, baby?
- No.

180
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,664
I don't feel well.

181
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:05,149
- Give me a kiss.
- I can do it, I can do it.

182
00:18:05,316 --> 00:18:06,840
No, you can't.

183
00:18:07,418 --> 00:18:10,148
Come here, come here.

184
00:18:12,023 --> 00:18:14,890
Honey, I'm gonna
make you some tea.

185
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:25,559
How many brothers and sisters
do you have?

186
00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:31,272
- Chelsea?
- Hey, Mommy.

187
00:18:31,442 --> 00:18:33,706
Hi, hon. Who are you talking to?

188
00:18:33,878 --> 00:18:37,439
- The girl who lives in my closet.
- Oh, yeah?

189
00:18:37,615 --> 00:18:39,913
- And what's her name?
- Jodie.

190
00:18:40,918 --> 00:18:44,445
You know there are plenty of other
little girls to play with in town too?

191
00:18:44,622 --> 00:18:46,852
I know, but Jodie says
they're all mean.

192
00:18:48,993 --> 00:18:50,255
Is that Jodie?

193
00:18:55,933 --> 00:18:58,424
No, that's someone else.

194
00:18:58,603 --> 00:19:00,093
Who?

195
00:19:00,271 --> 00:19:03,001
I'm not supposed to say who.

196
00:19:04,842 --> 00:19:07,367
She says it's an A-hole.

197
00:19:07,545 --> 00:19:10,036
You are not allowed
to say that word.

198
00:19:30,234 --> 00:19:32,429
George, George.

199
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,634
- Look what I found.
- What is that? Where'd you find that?

200
00:19:35,806 --> 00:19:37,034
Harry and I found it.

201
00:19:37,975 --> 00:19:40,307
- Where?
- In the basement.

202
00:19:40,878 --> 00:19:42,436
Not the basement.

203
00:19:42,613 --> 00:19:44,672
My office.

204
00:19:46,417 --> 00:19:48,885
You listen to me.
You don't go down there.

205
00:19:49,654 --> 00:19:51,246
Understand?

206
00:19:58,896 --> 00:20:01,626
Guys, would you help me
with the groceries?

207
00:20:03,534 --> 00:20:05,934
Go on, go help your mom.

208
00:20:10,975 --> 00:20:12,772
I'm sorry.

209
00:20:14,412 --> 00:20:15,970
Go on.

210
00:20:30,394 --> 00:20:33,420
- How are you feeling?
- Good, good.

211
00:20:34,432 --> 00:20:37,196
I found a babysitter off a board
at the grocery store.

212
00:20:37,368 --> 00:20:38,596
Billy will love that.

213
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:40,760
How about we call her
the young-adult-sitter?

214
00:20:43,407 --> 00:20:44,704
Where's Chelsea?

215
00:20:46,777 --> 00:20:48,369
Where's Chelsea?

216
00:20:57,989 --> 00:20:59,786
Chelsea?

217
00:21:07,431 --> 00:21:08,659
Chelsea?

218
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,900
Chelsea!

219
00:21:17,241 --> 00:21:18,640
Chelsea.

220
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:20,299
Hey, give me your hand.

221
00:21:20,611 --> 00:21:21,839
Give me your hand, sweetie.

222
00:21:22,013 --> 00:21:25,414
- Chelsea, go to George.
- Come on. Hey, give me your hand.

223
00:21:31,155 --> 00:21:33,885
What were you thinking?
You could have fallen in the water.

224
00:21:34,058 --> 00:21:35,958
Jodie wanted to see the boat.

225
00:21:39,096 --> 00:21:41,189
Somebody should have been
watching you.

226
00:22:41,392 --> 00:22:44,190
Billy, get up.

227
00:22:44,795 --> 00:22:47,320
Billy, I gotta go pee.

228
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,403
Chelsea.

229
00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:53,778
Goddamn it, Harry.

230
00:25:56,887 --> 00:25:59,720
Seriously. You trying to kill me?

231
00:27:07,124 --> 00:27:08,614
Come on, get away from there.

232
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:10,622
Hey, that's enough.

233
00:27:11,128 --> 00:27:12,755
Hey!

234
00:27:21,438 --> 00:27:23,872
George? Hon, what are you
doing down here?

235
00:27:24,742 --> 00:27:28,007
It's the only place
that's warm in this damn house.

236
00:27:29,179 --> 00:27:31,306
Somebody keeps opening
the windows.

237
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,648
What is that?

238
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,490
You tell me.

239
00:27:43,027 --> 00:27:45,928
- Why don't you come back to bed.
- No, I can't sleep.

240
00:27:46,096 --> 00:27:47,757
I'm sorry, baby.

241
00:27:47,931 --> 00:27:49,728
Don't...

242
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,630
Don't talk to me like
I'm one of your kids, okay?

243
00:27:52,803 --> 00:27:55,363
- What?
- That goddamn dog woke me up.

244
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,737
Billy's dog.

245
00:28:00,711 --> 00:28:02,144
Found him in the boathouse.

246
00:28:03,447 --> 00:28:05,938
- But you locked it.
- Yeah.

247
00:28:06,116 --> 00:28:08,676
Hey, and guess
what I found in Billy's room.

248
00:28:16,994 --> 00:28:19,087
You ready to talk
about those keys?

249
00:28:19,263 --> 00:28:22,460
There's not a lot in this world can't
be solved with an apology, Billy.

250
00:28:22,633 --> 00:28:25,033
I'm not apologizing
for something I didn't do...

251
00:28:25,202 --> 00:28:26,499
...George.

252
00:28:37,781 --> 00:28:39,874
Get to work, buddy.

253
00:28:42,553 --> 00:28:45,044
"Get to work, buddy. "

254
00:29:14,485 --> 00:29:16,544
"Katch 'em... "

255
00:29:18,589 --> 00:29:20,386
George?

256
00:29:20,891 --> 00:29:22,756
George?

257
00:29:23,393 --> 00:29:25,486
George, you down there?

258
00:29:27,498 --> 00:29:28,965
George?

259
00:29:31,502 --> 00:29:32,730
What?

260
00:29:32,903 --> 00:29:34,393
What's the matter?

261
00:29:36,473 --> 00:29:38,839
Did you do that thing
with the magnets?

262
00:29:44,281 --> 00:29:46,579
Nothing. Just seeing things,
I guess.

263
00:30:17,014 --> 00:30:18,276
You look hideous.

264
00:30:18,448 --> 00:30:21,042
You're rather repulsive yourself,
Mr. Lutz.

265
00:30:21,218 --> 00:30:23,709
- Where's the babysitter?
- Babysitter?

266
00:30:23,887 --> 00:30:25,684
Told you guys,
I don't need a babysitter.

267
00:30:25,856 --> 00:30:27,983
- I'm old enough.
- Baby, I know you can...

268
00:30:28,158 --> 00:30:32,094
I'm not letting her watch us. She's
not coming in, I won't let her. I won't.

269
00:30:32,729 --> 00:30:34,697
- She's not coming in.
- Billy, listen to me.

270
00:30:34,865 --> 00:30:38,028
- I won't leave you alone.
- I can't believe you hired a babysitter.

271
00:30:38,202 --> 00:30:39,794
- I told you I was old enough.
- Hi.

272
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:42,666
- I'm Lisa, the babysitter.
- Great.

273
00:30:43,273 --> 00:30:45,207
Can I take your coat?

274
00:30:45,475 --> 00:30:47,067
Okay.

275
00:30:49,012 --> 00:30:50,775
Hi.

276
00:30:52,649 --> 00:30:53,911
I'm Billy.

277
00:31:03,527 --> 00:31:06,155
You sure you don't want
a babysitter?

278
00:31:06,396 --> 00:31:08,387
Would you like me
to show you around?

279
00:31:08,565 --> 00:31:09,862
No, it's okay.

280
00:31:10,033 --> 00:31:12,695
I know it already.
I used to sit for the Defeos.

281
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,840
Kind of freaky being back here.

282
00:31:19,276 --> 00:31:20,868
I'm Billy.

283
00:31:21,078 --> 00:31:23,012
Yeah, I got you the first time.

284
00:31:23,814 --> 00:31:25,941
Have a good night, Billy.

285
00:31:34,091 --> 00:31:36,082
This is just what we needed,
don't you think?

286
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,922
Yeah. Definitely.

287
00:31:39,096 --> 00:31:41,030
You feeling all right?

288
00:31:41,331 --> 00:31:42,923
You know what?

289
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,931
I feel better.

290
00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:48,371
I think I just needed
to get out of the house.

291
00:31:48,538 --> 00:31:50,301
Come on, drink up.

292
00:31:50,474 --> 00:31:52,408
Are you trying
to get me drunk, Mr. Lutz?

293
00:31:53,543 --> 00:31:55,807
That's the appeal of marriage, hon.

294
00:31:55,979 --> 00:31:57,776
Hopefully, I won't have to.

295
00:32:05,188 --> 00:32:06,985
Be right out.

296
00:32:18,068 --> 00:32:19,296
Hungry?

297
00:32:20,337 --> 00:32:22,430
Kid, you read my mind.

298
00:32:22,973 --> 00:32:24,235
The kids, they're...

299
00:32:24,408 --> 00:32:26,569
They're going through
a tough time.

300
00:32:26,743 --> 00:32:29,109
I guess they're just
adjusting to everything.

301
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,304
Yeah, well, we all are.

302
00:32:33,183 --> 00:32:35,117
Do you feel different?

303
00:32:37,587 --> 00:32:39,248
What do you mean?

304
00:32:39,423 --> 00:32:41,186
About us.

305
00:32:42,826 --> 00:32:44,726
About me.

306
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:49,626
Yeah.

307
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,028
Yeah, I do.

308
00:32:53,003 --> 00:32:57,133
I feel like for the first time in my life,
I'm sure about something.

309
00:32:58,008 --> 00:32:59,839
And that's you.

310
00:33:01,678 --> 00:33:04,806
And I'm gonna spend the rest
of my life making you happy.

311
00:33:05,515 --> 00:33:08,416
Oh, boy, you know how
to turn on that Lutz charm.

312
00:33:19,162 --> 00:33:21,687
Some people say his tongue is fake.

313
00:33:23,967 --> 00:33:25,559
I think it's all him.

314
00:33:28,071 --> 00:33:29,504
Got this at a pinball arcade.

315
00:33:30,874 --> 00:33:32,398
Cool.

316
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:36,809
So do you French?

317
00:33:37,347 --> 00:33:38,939
Do I what?

318
00:33:39,116 --> 00:33:41,676
Kissing, tongues.

319
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,281
No.

320
00:33:46,556 --> 00:33:49,116
Did your family know the Defeos?

321
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:52,692
- The who?
- The family that lived here before you.

322
00:33:55,165 --> 00:33:56,826
No, we just moved here.

323
00:33:57,634 --> 00:34:00,398
Well, you know what
happened to them, don't you?

324
00:34:01,972 --> 00:34:02,802
No.

325
00:34:03,473 --> 00:34:05,668
I really shouldn't be telling you this.

326
00:34:08,378 --> 00:34:10,869
Your parents are gonna be pissed.

327
00:34:12,716 --> 00:34:14,343
It's okay.

328
00:34:18,388 --> 00:34:20,253
Stop. That's not how you play.

329
00:34:20,424 --> 00:34:24,884
- I can't hear you.
- Stop it. Let me try.

330
00:34:25,862 --> 00:34:28,092
You're killing him.

331
00:34:29,966 --> 00:34:32,958
So this wack job, Ronnie,
the guy that lived here.

332
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:36,739
People in this town say
he heard voices telling him to do it.

333
00:34:36,907 --> 00:34:41,207
The guy was a nut. I mean, first
he thinks his dog's out to get him.

334
00:34:41,378 --> 00:34:42,743
So he kills it.

335
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:47,609
A few days later, he thinks his family
is a bunch of demons.

336
00:34:48,118 --> 00:34:49,642
So you know what he did?

337
00:34:49,986 --> 00:34:51,283
Wasted them.

338
00:34:52,556 --> 00:34:54,285
How did he do it?

339
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:57,559
Do what?

340
00:34:57,727 --> 00:35:00,287
You are way too young to hear this.

341
00:35:00,464 --> 00:35:02,557
So cover your ears.

342
00:35:03,934 --> 00:35:06,459
And don't listen.

343
00:35:06,736 --> 00:35:08,397
A rifle.

344
00:35:10,774 --> 00:35:13,971
He went room to room,
splattering their heads as they slept.

345
00:35:15,178 --> 00:35:18,341
He killed his brothers
in this very room.

346
00:35:18,882 --> 00:35:20,679
Right here.

347
00:35:21,685 --> 00:35:23,710
In these beds.

348
00:35:30,927 --> 00:35:34,192
It's kind of gross
you guys still sleep in here.

349
00:35:37,667 --> 00:35:39,601
Actually, it's fucking sick.

350
00:35:40,637 --> 00:35:42,468
Yeah.

351
00:35:42,939 --> 00:35:44,668
I'm totally freaking you out, kid.

352
00:35:46,476 --> 00:35:48,876
I suck at babysitting.

353
00:35:55,051 --> 00:35:57,519
This was the little brat's room.

354
00:35:58,021 --> 00:35:59,989
Jodie's.

355
00:36:02,025 --> 00:36:04,357
You know, they found her in there.

356
00:36:05,128 --> 00:36:07,688
- Jodie says you're a bad babysitter.
- Yeah?

357
00:36:07,998 --> 00:36:11,229
Well, Jodie's...
What's the word? Dead.

358
00:36:11,835 --> 00:36:13,359
Is not.

359
00:36:13,537 --> 00:36:15,232
That little shit got me fired.

360
00:36:19,142 --> 00:36:20,871
Dare you to go in there.

361
00:36:22,812 --> 00:36:24,837
You give me your Kiss poster
if I do it?

362
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,517
Okay.

363
00:36:29,452 --> 00:36:31,181
Okay.

364
00:36:33,456 --> 00:36:35,686
You're going to make her mad.

365
00:36:44,801 --> 00:36:46,564
Come on, guys.

366
00:36:48,638 --> 00:36:50,230
Ha-ha, guys, this isn't funny.

367
00:36:50,407 --> 00:36:51,840
Billy, Michael.

368
00:36:54,578 --> 00:36:56,273
It's not opening. I can't open it.

369
00:36:56,446 --> 00:36:58,380
- Unlock the fucking door.
- There's no lock.

370
00:36:58,548 --> 00:37:00,277
This isn't funny. Let me the fuck out.

371
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:02,441
Billy, Michael.

372
00:37:03,086 --> 00:37:05,611
Let me out. Let me out of here.

373
00:37:06,723 --> 00:37:07,951
Let me out of here!

374
00:37:11,728 --> 00:37:13,093
What's going on?

375
00:37:13,496 --> 00:37:14,827
Let me out.

376
00:37:15,565 --> 00:37:17,692
Hi, Lisa.

377
00:37:21,471 --> 00:37:23,098
Look what Ronnie did.

378
00:37:42,626 --> 00:37:44,287
Let me out!

379
00:37:45,028 --> 00:37:46,962
Let me out of here!

380
00:37:47,998 --> 00:37:49,465
Let me out!

381
00:37:49,633 --> 00:37:52,067
Help me. Let me out!

382
00:38:02,312 --> 00:38:04,303
I saw Jodie.

383
00:38:04,481 --> 00:38:05,778
I saw Jodie.

384
00:38:05,949 --> 00:38:07,473
Who's Jodie?

385
00:38:07,751 --> 00:38:09,776
The little girl.

386
00:38:11,488 --> 00:38:13,149
She's dead.

387
00:38:13,323 --> 00:38:15,655
She's supposed to be dead.

388
00:38:22,399 --> 00:38:24,890
- It's one thing to pull a prank.
- We didn't pull a prank.

389
00:38:25,068 --> 00:38:27,536
- It's another one to hurt someone.
- It was this house.

390
00:38:27,704 --> 00:38:29,399
Shut up!

391
00:38:31,808 --> 00:38:33,366
- George.
- I got this under control.

392
00:38:33,543 --> 00:38:35,340
You don't have you under control.

393
00:38:38,381 --> 00:38:40,212
What you guys did was wrong.

394
00:38:40,417 --> 00:38:42,942
Stop it, Kathy.
Whatever you're doing...

395
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,053
...whatever you're saying
doesn't work.

396
00:38:46,122 --> 00:38:49,148
From now on, I'm doing the
disciplining around here, end of story.

397
00:38:49,526 --> 00:38:51,619
This house is bad, Mommy.

398
00:38:52,228 --> 00:38:53,718
Michael, honey.

399
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:57,832
There's no bad houses.
There's just bad people.

400
00:38:59,536 --> 00:39:02,630
Why didn't you tell us
about the people who died here?

401
00:39:05,742 --> 00:39:08,074
- Where did you hear that?
- The babysitter told me...

402
00:39:08,244 --> 00:39:11,543
...that two little boys died
in our room.

403
00:39:17,253 --> 00:39:19,312
Goddamn babysitter's an idiot.

404
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:23,185
Get to bed. We'll deal with this
in the morning.

405
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,590
No, I'm not sleeping in that room.
It's gross.

406
00:39:25,762 --> 00:39:28,128
- Me neither.
- Wipe that stupid look off your face...

407
00:39:28,298 --> 00:39:29,788
...and go to bed.

408
00:39:32,936 --> 00:39:34,528
Run.

409
00:39:57,193 --> 00:39:59,388
Why all the yelling, Mommy?

410
00:40:00,663 --> 00:40:04,360
It's nothing. It's over now, baby.

411
00:40:07,203 --> 00:40:10,036
I need you to tell me
what happened with Lisa, honey.

412
00:40:10,206 --> 00:40:13,073
Lisa was being mean to Jodie.

413
00:40:13,243 --> 00:40:14,642
So Jodie hurt her.

414
00:40:15,412 --> 00:40:17,573
- Jodie.
- It's okay, Mommy.

415
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:20,449
Jodie won't hurt you.

416
00:40:20,884 --> 00:40:22,749
She thinks you're a good mommy.

417
00:40:26,089 --> 00:40:27,954
But the man who lives here...

418
00:40:28,992 --> 00:40:31,654
...she says he's bad.

419
00:40:32,595 --> 00:40:35,359
She wants him to go away.

420
00:40:35,665 --> 00:40:39,157
He makes her do bad things.

421
00:40:46,209 --> 00:40:47,574
Move it...

422
00:40:47,744 --> 00:40:49,644
...from there to there.

423
00:40:49,813 --> 00:40:51,144
Go.

424
00:40:56,286 --> 00:40:58,652
And, Billy, don't come in
until you're finished.

425
00:41:38,361 --> 00:41:39,885
What?

426
00:41:40,964 --> 00:41:43,797
Is this discipline or torture?

427
00:41:43,967 --> 00:41:46,128
Thought it was meat loaf.

428
00:41:53,009 --> 00:41:56,172
When the body suffers,
the spirit flowers.

429
00:41:56,446 --> 00:41:58,573
It's what my dad taught me.

430
00:41:58,748 --> 00:42:02,115
His dad's not around
to teach him that, now, is he?

431
00:42:12,595 --> 00:42:16,053
Billy, why is George such a jerk?

432
00:42:16,232 --> 00:42:20,032
He's not a jerk. He's a douche bag.

433
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:22,495
And a weirdo.

434
00:42:22,705 --> 00:42:25,538
And a doofus and a dipstick.

435
00:42:25,742 --> 00:42:27,869
<i>Catch them. </i>

436
00:42:28,044 --> 00:42:30,035
<i>Kill them. </i>

437
00:42:33,082 --> 00:42:35,107
<i>Catch them. </i>

438
00:42:35,752 --> 00:42:37,617
<i>Kill them. </i>

439
00:42:45,028 --> 00:42:47,622
<i>Catch them. Kill them. </i>

440
00:42:49,399 --> 00:42:51,333
<i>Catch them. </i>

441
00:42:51,501 --> 00:42:53,401
<i>Kill them. </i>

442
00:43:10,486 --> 00:43:12,477
Kill them.

443
00:44:28,865 --> 00:44:30,958
- No! No!
- Look at me.

444
00:44:31,134 --> 00:44:33,432
- No!
- What's the matter?

445
00:44:34,003 --> 00:44:36,096
- God!
- It's me.

446
00:44:36,272 --> 00:44:38,399
- It's me.
- God!

447
00:44:42,745 --> 00:44:45,077
Baby, it's all right.

448
00:44:51,854 --> 00:44:54,288
Do you use narcotics, Mr. Lutz?

449
00:44:54,457 --> 00:44:56,652
No. But after this week,
I'm gonna give it...

450
00:44:56,826 --> 00:44:58,657
...some serious thought.

451
00:45:01,597 --> 00:45:04,589
Suffer from headaches, nausea?

452
00:45:04,767 --> 00:45:08,601
Actually, I feel great now.

453
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:11,333
Weird as that may sound.

454
00:45:12,875 --> 00:45:15,207
Well, there's no sign
of a concussion.

455
00:45:15,378 --> 00:45:17,005
No sign of any bruising at all.

456
00:45:20,249 --> 00:45:22,740
I want you to give Dr. Stone a call.

457
00:45:23,786 --> 00:45:26,983
Wait, wait, wait.
This is a psychiatrist.

458
00:45:27,156 --> 00:45:30,182
- Do I look nuts to you?
- I'm not trying to offend you here.

459
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:32,793
I'm just trying to help you
figure out the problem.

460
00:45:41,137 --> 00:45:42,934
I feel like it's my fault, George.

461
00:45:43,106 --> 00:45:45,199
- Kath.
- I was the one who wanted this place.

462
00:45:45,374 --> 00:45:47,740
- I put too much pressure on you.
- This is the life...

463
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:49,434
...that I want too, okay?

464
00:45:51,247 --> 00:45:54,273
We got the old American dream here.

465
00:45:54,517 --> 00:45:56,576
Okay? There's no way in hell...

466
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:58,687
...that I'm letting that get away now.

467
00:46:02,592 --> 00:46:03,820
I love you, George.

468
00:46:10,266 --> 00:46:12,826
Billy, can I get my teddy?

469
00:46:13,002 --> 00:46:14,970
She's real hungry.

470
00:46:15,138 --> 00:46:18,164
Okay, go. And hurry up.

471
00:46:18,341 --> 00:46:21,105
Mom finds out I let you out
of my sight, she's gonna kill me.

472
00:46:45,935 --> 00:46:47,266
Hi, Mommy.

473
00:46:47,436 --> 00:46:49,734
Look at me, Mommy.

474
00:46:49,939 --> 00:46:51,338
Hi, Mommy.

475
00:46:54,777 --> 00:46:56,768
Hi, Mommy.

476
00:46:57,713 --> 00:46:59,078
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

477
00:46:59,248 --> 00:47:02,581
- Chelsea.
- Chelsea, don't move. Just sit down.

478
00:47:03,786 --> 00:47:05,276
Chelsea.

479
00:47:12,395 --> 00:47:14,056
Chelsea.

480
00:47:16,933 --> 00:47:18,924
Hold the ladder.

481
00:47:19,168 --> 00:47:20,863
Honey, stay there.

482
00:47:24,006 --> 00:47:25,871
Chelsea.

483
00:47:26,108 --> 00:47:27,507
Chelsea.

484
00:47:30,646 --> 00:47:33,080
- Chelsea.
- Goddamn it, Chelsea.

485
00:47:33,249 --> 00:47:36,412
Which way?
Which way did they go?

486
00:47:36,986 --> 00:47:38,476
Going left.

487
00:47:48,497 --> 00:47:50,362
Chelsea.

488
00:48:09,285 --> 00:48:10,877
What are you doing up here?

489
00:48:13,856 --> 00:48:15,289
I have to go with Jodie, Mommy.

490
00:48:15,591 --> 00:48:17,115
Baby...

491
00:48:17,293 --> 00:48:19,284
...you come to Mommy.

492
00:48:20,296 --> 00:48:21,558
No!

493
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,227
George.

494
00:48:26,402 --> 00:48:28,529
- Hang on.
- Hurry.

495
00:48:31,774 --> 00:48:33,469
George!

496
00:48:33,643 --> 00:48:35,873
George, please, God, I'm slipping.

497
00:48:37,546 --> 00:48:39,036
George!

498
00:48:39,715 --> 00:48:41,683
George!

499
00:48:45,621 --> 00:48:47,088
<i>Chelsea. </i>

500
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:49,521
What would you...?
Why would you do that?

501
00:48:49,692 --> 00:48:51,785
Sorry. I'm sorry.

502
00:48:51,994 --> 00:48:53,586
You can't do that to Mommy.

503
00:48:53,763 --> 00:48:57,130
- Jodie wanted to show me something.
- There is no Jodie, okay?

504
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,234
- Yes, there is.
- No, there isn't!

505
00:48:59,402 --> 00:49:02,303
- You have to stop this!
- Jodie's real.

506
00:49:03,439 --> 00:49:06,840
- Jodie's real. She's...
- She is not real!

507
00:49:07,009 --> 00:49:08,977
Liar! Liar!

508
00:49:09,145 --> 00:49:10,806
Liar!

509
00:49:12,782 --> 00:49:14,807
I've seen her.

510
00:49:17,153 --> 00:49:19,212
She was gonna show me Daddy.

511
00:49:19,388 --> 00:49:21,856
I just wanted to see Daddy.

512
00:49:23,059 --> 00:49:25,152
Jodie promised to take me to Daddy.

513
00:49:25,328 --> 00:49:27,819
She says I can stay here
so we can play together...

514
00:49:27,997 --> 00:49:29,760
...forever and ever.

515
00:49:31,701 --> 00:49:33,760
Do you miss your daddy?

516
00:49:33,936 --> 00:49:35,426
Yes.

517
00:49:35,604 --> 00:49:38,903
- Do you miss your daddy a lot?
- Yes.

518
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:42,974
I know you miss your daddy, baby.

519
00:49:44,246 --> 00:49:46,009
But no one can see him because...

520
00:49:46,682 --> 00:49:48,616
...he's in heaven.

521
00:49:49,952 --> 00:49:51,476
He's with the angels.

522
00:49:52,922 --> 00:49:55,288
He's with the angels.

523
00:49:59,462 --> 00:50:01,657
I just got so scared.

524
00:50:12,274 --> 00:50:13,866
What's the matter with you people?

525
00:50:23,919 --> 00:50:25,853
Wacko family.

526
00:50:56,352 --> 00:50:57,876
Father Callaway?

527
00:50:58,487 --> 00:51:00,045
Father.

528
00:51:00,923 --> 00:51:02,686
Kathy Lutz.

529
00:51:02,858 --> 00:51:04,325
Hello.

530
00:51:04,927 --> 00:51:06,861
Do you have a moment?

531
00:51:11,567 --> 00:51:14,536
It's my family.

532
00:51:15,004 --> 00:51:17,336
We've changed. It's...

533
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,701
It's like we've grown apart.

534
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:22,801
I don't think I understand.

535
00:51:26,282 --> 00:51:29,615
There's something...

536
00:51:30,352 --> 00:51:33,412
There's something evil in my house.

537
00:51:37,326 --> 00:51:39,487
I know it sounds...

538
00:51:39,662 --> 00:51:41,926
...crazy, I know that.

539
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:44,328
I would think the same.

540
00:51:45,201 --> 00:51:46,964
I just don't know where else to go.

541
00:51:53,709 --> 00:51:55,802
There was a family...

542
00:51:56,245 --> 00:51:57,610
...lived here some time ago.

543
00:51:59,148 --> 00:52:01,446
They had a similar problem.

544
00:52:01,617 --> 00:52:03,084
The Defeos.

545
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,615
You knew them?

546
00:52:08,657 --> 00:52:10,420
I'm living in their house.

547
00:52:18,234 --> 00:52:19,929
Now, hold it steady.

548
00:52:20,102 --> 00:52:23,037
Because if you get shaky,
I get shaky.

549
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,741
Go!

550
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:39,485
What, are you crying?

551
00:52:40,656 --> 00:52:43,386
Why are you crying?
That wasn't so bad.

552
00:52:43,893 --> 00:52:45,827
Pick up another log.

553
00:52:46,195 --> 00:52:47,662
Hurry up, pick up another log.

554
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:49,457
Hurry up.

555
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,998
Put your hands up there.
Put your hands up there.

556
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:55,632
No.

557
00:52:56,105 --> 00:52:57,732
Put...

558
00:52:58,707 --> 00:53:01,733
We're friends.
We're having fun, right?

559
00:53:01,911 --> 00:53:03,378
Put your hands up there.

560
00:53:11,887 --> 00:53:13,821
Go!

561
00:54:11,981 --> 00:54:14,211
Come here, little girl.

562
00:54:19,622 --> 00:54:22,182
You're my favorite girl.

563
00:54:43,379 --> 00:54:44,869
<i>Catch them. </i>

564
00:54:45,047 --> 00:54:46,912
<i>Kill them. </i>

565
00:57:38,053 --> 00:57:39,714
George.

566
00:57:43,525 --> 00:57:45,686
I think there's something
seriously wrong here.

567
00:57:46,895 --> 00:57:49,022
Something's not right.

568
00:57:50,466 --> 00:57:52,297
What's not right?

569
00:57:55,871 --> 00:57:57,532
We need to get out of here.

570
00:57:57,706 --> 00:58:00,937
To just go. Just pack up and go.

571
00:58:02,344 --> 00:58:04,505
No, no, no.

572
00:58:04,847 --> 00:58:07,941
You know, you can't run away
from your problems, Kath.

573
00:58:09,985 --> 00:58:11,612
Please, let's go, George.

574
00:58:12,421 --> 00:58:15,356
- Somewhere. Anywhere.
- Did you hear that?

575
00:58:17,159 --> 00:58:20,026
Do you hear that squeak?
I gotta fix that squeak.

576
00:58:20,863 --> 00:58:24,230
Because, you know, these houses,
they're big...

577
00:58:25,534 --> 00:58:28,833
Big projects. Kath, and you
can't just walk away from it.

578
00:58:36,445 --> 00:58:38,242
How did you get so fucking stupid?

579
00:58:39,515 --> 00:58:41,346
What?

580
00:58:43,418 --> 00:58:47,411
Everything we have is in this house.
Everything.

581
00:58:47,589 --> 00:58:49,580
I'm not worried
about our goddamn money.

582
00:58:49,825 --> 00:58:51,224
Oh, our money.

583
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,594
George, we're losing each other.

584
00:58:54,763 --> 00:58:56,697
Don't you see that?

585
00:58:57,466 --> 00:58:59,991
We stay here,
we'll have a house for the family...

586
00:59:00,168 --> 00:59:02,329
...only there won't be a family.

587
00:59:05,274 --> 00:59:07,834
It's always so cold in here.

588
00:59:09,378 --> 00:59:12,438
Would you let the stove alone
and pay attention to me?

589
00:59:12,614 --> 00:59:14,377
I'm not going anywhere,
neither are you.

590
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:16,017
So shut up about that!

591
00:59:16,585 --> 00:59:18,177
Just shut up!

592
00:59:18,587 --> 00:59:20,077
Goddamn it.

593
00:59:20,589 --> 00:59:22,887
You're the one who wanted
this godforsaken house.

594
00:59:23,058 --> 00:59:24,389
Well, now you got it.

595
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,289
Mom! Mom!

596
00:59:26,595 --> 00:59:28,688
Home sweet home.

597
00:59:32,734 --> 00:59:33,962
What is it, sweetie?

598
00:59:34,136 --> 00:59:36,400
We can't find Harry anywhere.
He's gone.

599
00:59:38,307 --> 00:59:40,298
I'll help you look in a sec, sweetie.

600
00:59:40,509 --> 00:59:42,500
You seen Harry, George?

601
00:59:43,211 --> 00:59:45,202
No, I haven't, Billy.

602
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:49,911
Maybe he ran away.

603
00:59:50,085 --> 00:59:51,552
Harry never runs away, George.

604
00:59:52,621 --> 00:59:54,714
What's the matter with you, William?

605
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:56,448
Get out of here now.

606
00:59:56,625 --> 01:00:00,721
- Now!
- Fine. Come on, Michael.

607
01:00:29,157 --> 01:00:31,853
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

608
01:00:46,541 --> 01:00:48,270
- Hello?
- Is your mommy home?

609
01:00:48,443 --> 01:00:49,842
Hold on a second.

610
01:00:50,345 --> 01:00:52,438
Mommy, there's someone
at the door.

611
01:00:52,614 --> 01:00:54,138
Who is it, honey?

612
01:00:55,884 --> 01:00:57,181
Come in, Father.

613
01:01:07,129 --> 01:01:08,858
This is gonna sound strange...

614
01:01:09,031 --> 01:01:12,831
...but you know the doll with one eye
that your daughter is holding?

615
01:01:13,135 --> 01:01:16,298
Well, that belonged to the little girl
who lived here before you.

616
01:01:16,672 --> 01:01:18,572
Yes, it was left here.

617
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:21,709
No, Mrs. Lutz, it was not left here.

618
01:01:24,446 --> 01:01:26,971
Father, what exactly
are you trying to tell me?

619
01:01:27,149 --> 01:01:30,744
I knew the Defeos very well.
I presided over their funeral.

620
01:01:31,353 --> 01:01:33,878
Jodie Defeo was buried
with that doll.

621
01:01:44,533 --> 01:01:45,761
Oh, heavenly Father.

622
01:01:47,502 --> 01:01:49,493
Almighty God...

623
01:01:53,942 --> 01:01:56,376
...we ask you to bless...

624
01:01:57,979 --> 01:02:00,607
...and sanctify this house.

625
01:02:02,684 --> 01:02:07,712
To bless all who live here...

626
01:02:08,223 --> 01:02:13,092
...and to bring them the abundance
of all thy fruits.

627
01:03:06,615 --> 01:03:09,311
<i>Get out. </i>

628
01:03:13,355 --> 01:03:15,016
Father!

629
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:16,851
Father!

630
01:03:20,095 --> 01:03:21,585
Why are you leaving us?

631
01:03:22,264 --> 01:03:24,027
What's the matter?

632
01:03:29,938 --> 01:03:33,772
It's okay. I'm here.

633
01:03:56,331 --> 01:03:58,390
<i>Catch them. </i>

634
01:03:58,567 --> 01:04:00,091
<i>Kill them. </i>

635
01:04:06,374 --> 01:04:09,275
Oh, goddamn it, Harry!

636
01:04:11,246 --> 01:04:12,838
<i>Catch them. </i>

637
01:04:14,883 --> 01:04:16,510
<i>Kill them. </i>

638
01:04:43,378 --> 01:04:45,437
<i>Catch them. </i>

639
01:04:46,815 --> 01:04:48,874
<i>Kill them. </i>

640
01:04:49,718 --> 01:04:51,811
<i>Catch them. </i>

641
01:05:26,521 --> 01:05:28,580
<i>There was a crime. A murder. </i>

642
01:05:28,857 --> 01:05:30,290
<i>You know, the town has moved on. </i>

643
01:05:30,458 --> 01:05:35,361
<i>And it is a distant memory now,</i>
<i>and the house is fine. </i>

644
01:05:46,942 --> 01:05:49,467
We don't open
for a few more minutes.

645
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:06,320
"Voices told him to do it. "

646
01:06:10,332 --> 01:06:13,130
"He just moved into the basement. "

647
01:06:15,136 --> 01:06:17,502
"Twenty-eights days later
he killed them all. "

648
01:06:31,052 --> 01:06:32,280
Oh, my God.

649
01:07:23,271 --> 01:07:26,069
"Reverend Jeremiah Ketcham. "

650
01:07:36,918 --> 01:07:39,580
"He started a mission for Indians. "

651
01:08:26,201 --> 01:08:28,328
"He slaughtered them all. "

652
01:08:40,982 --> 01:08:44,418
"Over 20 bodies were found
in the lake. "

653
01:09:01,870 --> 01:09:03,633
<i>Catch them. </i>

654
01:09:05,974 --> 01:09:07,965
<i>Kill them. </i>

655
01:09:35,904 --> 01:09:37,565
Father.

656
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,733
Why did you run away
from my house?

657
01:09:43,745 --> 01:09:45,736
Why did you abandon us?

658
01:09:46,347 --> 01:09:49,646
Your house frightens me, Mrs. Lutz.

659
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:56,584
I just read about this man,
Ketcham...

660
01:09:57,158 --> 01:10:01,390
...who tortured Indians on my land.
On my basement.

661
01:10:06,601 --> 01:10:09,297
I read about how he slit his throat...

662
01:10:09,470 --> 01:10:12,030
...so that his presence
would live forever.

663
01:10:12,207 --> 01:10:14,539
Do you believe this could be true?

664
01:10:14,876 --> 01:10:18,175
Ronnie Defeo came to me
weeks before the murders...

665
01:10:18,346 --> 01:10:23,374
...and he spoke about hearing voices
and seeing things in the house.

666
01:10:23,952 --> 01:10:26,216
I didn't believe him until yesterday.

667
01:10:28,223 --> 01:10:32,683
Mrs. Lutz, get you and your family
out of that house...

668
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:34,191
...right now.

669
01:10:47,609 --> 01:10:48,837
- Hello?
<i>- George. </i>

670
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:51,308
<i>George, I've just been to see</i>
<i>Father Callaway. </i>

671
01:10:51,479 --> 01:10:54,471
<i>Listen to me, you gotta get you</i>
<i>and the kids out of the house. </i>

672
01:10:55,617 --> 01:10:57,084
<i>George?</i>

673
01:10:58,419 --> 01:10:59,943
<i>Are you there? George?</i>

674
01:11:13,534 --> 01:11:17,937
Billy! Michael! Where's George?

675
01:11:18,106 --> 01:11:20,233
He's in the boathouse.

676
01:11:37,925 --> 01:11:41,156
George, we have
to get out of here now.

677
01:11:41,329 --> 01:11:42,921
George!

678
01:12:22,737 --> 01:12:24,671
Are you fucking crazy, George?

679
01:12:24,906 --> 01:12:26,498
Have you lost your mind?

680
01:12:26,674 --> 01:12:28,232
You tried to kill me.

681
01:12:33,481 --> 01:12:36,314
- Chelsea!
- Mommy! Mommy!

682
01:12:36,484 --> 01:12:37,849
I'm down here, Mommy!

683
01:12:39,187 --> 01:12:41,747
Chelsea, honey,
what are you doing down here?

684
01:13:09,884 --> 01:13:11,511
I think she misses her daddy.

685
01:13:14,822 --> 01:13:16,380
Don't you?

686
01:13:17,759 --> 01:13:19,590
Give me back my daughter.

687
01:13:25,299 --> 01:13:29,133
I wanna talk to you. Wait.
I wanna talk to you!

688
01:13:30,004 --> 01:13:32,438
Kids, get down here, now!

689
01:13:32,607 --> 01:13:34,438
Kids, get down here!

690
01:13:34,609 --> 01:13:36,975
- Billy, help me push this!
- Mom, where are you going?

691
01:13:40,481 --> 01:13:42,039
Billy!

692
01:13:43,284 --> 01:13:44,546
- Hurry. Go.
- Billy!

693
01:13:46,154 --> 01:13:47,951
Mom, why are you wet?

694
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:51,554
Mommy! Mommy!

695
01:13:53,728 --> 01:13:55,491
Come on, Mom!

696
01:13:57,031 --> 01:13:58,362
Hurry.

697
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:01,534
Billy, come on!

698
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:17,545
Run! Go, go, go!

699
01:14:20,354 --> 01:14:21,981
You're stuck! You're stuck!

700
01:14:22,423 --> 01:14:24,050
Stay here!

701
01:14:26,627 --> 01:14:27,855
Great!

702
01:14:28,696 --> 01:14:32,496
Let go of my mom, you bastard!
Let go right now! Let go.

703
01:14:37,071 --> 01:14:39,767
- What the hell is your problem?
- Let's go.

704
01:14:40,775 --> 01:14:42,538
These kids are out of control.

705
01:14:45,213 --> 01:14:48,011
- Mom, it's stuck!
- It won't open!

706
01:14:50,318 --> 01:14:52,149
Where's Chelsea? Chelsea!

707
01:15:05,666 --> 01:15:10,126
- Hurry, hurry, Billy. Hurry.
- Come on. Let's go. Be quiet, be quiet.

708
01:15:54,882 --> 01:15:56,747
Billy!

709
01:16:42,496 --> 01:16:44,794
I want you to hold on tight.

710
01:16:55,610 --> 01:16:57,305
Jump, baby.

711
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:01,011
- Come on, honey.
- Come on.

712
01:17:01,182 --> 01:17:02,809
- Come on, Michael.
- No, Mommy.

713
01:17:02,984 --> 01:17:04,975
- No.
- Hurry, baby.

714
01:17:05,953 --> 01:17:08,353
Come on, Michael.
Come on, Michael.

715
01:17:09,557 --> 01:17:11,286
- Come on, hurry.
- Let's get out of here.

716
01:17:14,128 --> 01:17:16,653
- Come here. Come here.
- No.

717
01:17:19,467 --> 01:17:21,799
You leave him alone.

718
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:27,532
<i>Kill them. </i>

719
01:17:28,409 --> 01:17:30,138
Don't hurt him!

720
01:17:32,146 --> 01:17:34,307
Back the fuck up!

721
01:18:16,223 --> 01:18:17,656
<i>Kill them. </i>

722
01:18:25,633 --> 01:18:28,329
Hurry. Let's grab some rope.

723
01:18:30,271 --> 01:18:32,171
<i>Kill them. </i>

724
01:18:50,791 --> 01:18:53,692
Kathy, kill me!

725
01:18:54,395 --> 01:18:56,420
You kill me, or I'll kill you!

726
01:18:56,731 --> 01:18:58,961
Nobody's dying today.

727
01:19:20,888 --> 01:19:23,755
Okay, let's get him in the boat.

728
01:19:47,915 --> 01:19:50,076
Why are we taking him?
Let's just leave him here.

729
01:19:50,251 --> 01:19:53,618
I can't explain it to you right now. We
have to get him away from the house.

730
01:20:52,413 --> 01:20:54,574
Don't even look at it, Kathy.

731
01:20:54,815 --> 01:20:56,305
Let's get out of here.
