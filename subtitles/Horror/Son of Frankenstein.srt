1
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:15,920
- Ain't you afraid?
- Of old Ygor? No.

2
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,188
- I say that I, for one, will not.
- Enough!

3
00:02:35,106 --> 00:02:37,525
He'll be met exactly as arranged.

4
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,635
Now, friends, on his deathbed...

5
00:02:39,735 --> 00:02:42,680
the old Baron Frankenstein
gave me this chest of papers...

6
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,892
to deliver to his son,
and deliver it I shall.

7
00:02:45,992 --> 00:02:48,436
Haven't we had enough of that name here?

8
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:52,565
There was a time when our village
was prosperous and happy. Look at it now.

9
00:02:52,665 --> 00:02:56,444
Forsaken, desolate,
shunned by every traveller, and why?

10
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:58,571
Because of these Frankensteins.

11
00:02:58,671 --> 00:03:02,491
We live in the black shadow
of that cursed place up on the hill...

12
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:06,537
where only that crazy Ygor,
with his broken neck, dares to stay.

13
00:03:06,637 --> 00:03:11,559
And now we go to the railway station
to welcome another Frankenstein.

14
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,313
This one is probably
just as bad as his father...

15
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:18,607
who created a monster
in the devil's own image.

16
00:03:19,734 --> 00:03:21,385
It's in the blood, I tell you.

17
00:03:21,485 --> 00:03:25,097
We've said these same words
a thousand times, and they get us nowhere.

18
00:03:25,197 --> 00:03:28,267
Fine talk, Herr Inspector.

19
00:03:28,367 --> 00:03:32,188
But Baron Frankenstein
does arrive tonight to claim his heritage.

20
00:03:32,288 --> 00:03:34,815
- And then what?
- Yes, what then?

21
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:38,452
That's true, but he'll find
no friends here.

22
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:41,722
Nothing but locked doors
and darkened windows...

23
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:44,058
locked hearts and bitter hatred.

24
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,954
Let that, too, be a part
of the Frankenstein heritage.

25
00:03:48,412 --> 00:03:49,997
Come, gentlemen.

26
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,994
We'll be there soon, darling.

27
00:04:03,094 --> 00:04:05,246
That's good. So I can see Amelia.

28
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:09,851
That's right. Amelia will be there
waiting for you, and so glad to see you.

29
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:26,909
What strange-looking country.

30
00:04:28,452 --> 00:04:30,646
Not much like America, is it?

31
00:04:30,746 --> 00:04:33,941
On my first trip to Europe,
I was prepared for anything...

32
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,360
but I'm glad
we went to London and Paris first.

33
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,863
We must be getting close
to the village now.

34
00:04:38,963 --> 00:04:40,965
It's exciting, isn't it?

35
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:44,635
Out there in the darkness,
a new life lies before us.

36
00:04:45,511 --> 00:04:47,914
No more college classrooms
or faculty meetings.

37
00:04:48,014 --> 00:04:50,541
- I feel rather like an explorer.
- That's what it is.

38
00:04:50,641 --> 00:04:53,127
We're going to explore
something so foreign to us...

39
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:55,254
we can't even imagine
what it'll be like.

40
00:04:55,354 --> 00:04:57,882
A medieval castle.
I wonder if there's a moat.

41
00:04:57,982 --> 00:05:01,010
And a drawbridge,
and a great tall, dark tower.

42
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,138
And battlements.
Perhaps there's a haunted room.

43
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:09,118
Yes, there's sure to be a haunted room.
The castle itself is supposed to be haunted.

44
00:05:09,952 --> 00:05:11,579
- Because of...
- Yes.

45
00:05:11,787 --> 00:05:14,524
Because of the things
my father did there.

46
00:05:14,624 --> 00:05:18,694
I remember the stories Mother used to
tell me when I was quite young in England.

47
00:05:18,794 --> 00:05:21,572
It wasn't my father's fault
that the being he created...

48
00:05:21,672 --> 00:05:24,158
became a senseless, murderous monster.
He was right.

49
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:27,203
You understand that, don't you, dear?
He was right.

50
00:05:27,303 --> 00:05:30,540
It was the unforeseen blunder
of a stupid assistant...

51
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,852
that gave his creation the brain
of a killer instead of a normal one.

52
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:40,024
And how my father was made
to suffer for that mistake.

53
00:05:40,191 --> 00:05:43,736
His name has become synonymous
with horror and monsters.

54
00:05:43,861 --> 00:05:46,055
Why, nine out of ten people...

55
00:05:46,155 --> 00:05:48,724
call that misshapen creature
of my father's experiments...

56
00:05:48,824 --> 00:05:51,369
Frankenstein.

57
00:06:05,424 --> 00:06:07,201
- Herr Baron Frankenstein?
- Yes.

58
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:09,871
I will see that madam and the bags
are placed in the car.

59
00:06:09,971 --> 00:06:12,248
The Burgomaster's on the platform
waiting for you.

60
00:06:12,348 --> 00:06:13,683
Thank you.

61
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,172
- Herr Baron Frankenstein?
- Yes.

62
00:06:19,272 --> 00:06:21,549
I am Burgomaster of the village.

63
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:23,885
It's a great pleasure to see you,
Herr Burgomaster.

64
00:06:23,985 --> 00:06:26,429
These are the gentlemen of the council.

65
00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:29,407
We come to meet you, not to greet you.

66
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:34,871
I deliver you these,
on the instructions of your late father.

67
00:06:34,996 --> 00:06:36,022
Thank you.

68
00:06:36,122 --> 00:06:39,458
The large box contains certain papers
pertaining to the estate.

69
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:43,613
- The small one, the key that will open it.
- Thank you, I...

70
00:06:43,713 --> 00:06:47,492
It is unfortunate that we cannot offer you
a more cheerful welcome.

71
00:06:47,592 --> 00:06:49,093
But we can't.

72
00:06:50,761 --> 00:06:54,832
Herr Burgomaster,
gentlemen of the council, villagers.

73
00:06:54,932 --> 00:06:57,543
I quite realise
that it was my father's misfortune...

74
00:06:57,643 --> 00:07:00,771
to be the unwilling,
unknowing cause of tragedy.

75
00:07:01,272 --> 00:07:03,800
I'm so sorry
that I don't remember him...

76
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,944
because I've been told
that he was a good man.

77
00:07:07,987 --> 00:07:12,200
And I know how greatly your tragedy
must have weighed upon his mind.

78
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:17,438
I can't undo
the wrongs that you've suffered...

79
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:20,691
but I beg of you,
let the dead past remain buried.

80
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:23,044
My wife and I, and our son...

81
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:25,880
we want so much to be your friends.

82
00:07:36,265 --> 00:07:39,143
There is a car waiting, Herr Baron.

83
00:07:40,228 --> 00:07:43,539
Thank you. Thank you for your courtesy.

84
00:08:23,271 --> 00:08:26,816
- There's my little darling!
- Amelia!

85
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,853
I am glad to see you, Benson.

86
00:08:38,953 --> 00:08:43,207
- Thank you, sir. Should I take this?
- No, just take my coat, will you?

87
00:08:49,088 --> 00:08:51,424
I'm so glad to see you.

88
00:08:51,883 --> 00:08:53,050
Bless you.

89
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:57,205
What a comfort to find you here.

90
00:08:57,305 --> 00:09:00,166
- Welcome, madam. Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, Amelia.

91
00:09:00,266 --> 00:09:02,919
Peter had better go right to bed.
It's been a long trip.

92
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:04,629
Come along, darling.

93
00:09:04,729 --> 00:09:07,398
Amelia, are the bedrooms cheery?

94
00:09:09,525 --> 00:09:12,236
Yes, madam, quite cheery.

95
00:09:12,945 --> 00:09:15,072
I think you'll be surprised.

96
00:09:18,326 --> 00:09:21,954
It's medieval.
It's exciting, exhilarating.

97
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:28,361
You really feel that you
belong here already?

98
00:09:28,461 --> 00:09:30,129
Yes, I think I do.

99
00:09:31,464 --> 00:09:33,382
Why? Don't you like it?

100
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:39,347
It all seems so unreal,
but I'm excited, too.

101
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:41,332
Good night, Daddy!

102
00:09:41,432 --> 00:09:44,794
Daddy, look at me.
I'm way up here on a mountain.

103
00:09:44,894 --> 00:09:46,495
Good night, son.

104
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:53,460
I'll go and freshen up a bit
and see that Peter is put to bed.

105
00:09:59,174 --> 00:10:01,843
I'm terribly glad you're here with me.

106
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:06,390
Amelia, wait for me.
I don't want to get lost.

107
00:10:12,229 --> 00:10:15,382
Where did you get those other servants?
They look like Tyroleans.

108
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:18,719
They are. None of the people
of this province would serve here...

109
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:21,446
no matter what I offered to pay them.

110
00:10:21,947 --> 00:10:24,366
Strange, superstitious creatures.

111
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:29,454
- Where's the library, if there is a library?
- Here it is, sir.

112
00:10:51,268 --> 00:10:54,229
I think you're rather
like your father, sir.

113
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:58,650
If only I could have
some small portion of his genius.

114
00:11:00,777 --> 00:11:02,612
Think of it, Benson.

115
00:11:03,113 --> 00:11:05,240
Here, in this very study...

116
00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:09,995
the luminous facets of his brilliant mind
conceived his outstanding theory...

117
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:13,290
of the source of life.

118
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,085
Here, he planned a miracle...

119
00:11:18,128 --> 00:11:20,088
and saw it come to pass.

120
00:11:21,923 --> 00:11:25,160
A miracle that the good people
of Frankenstein called a monster.

121
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,537
They call it a lot worse than that, sir.

122
00:11:27,637 --> 00:11:30,374
Such stories as I've never heard.

123
00:11:30,474 --> 00:11:33,935
- Would you like a brandy, sir?
- Yes, thank you, Benson.

124
00:11:51,828 --> 00:11:53,038
"My son.

125
00:11:54,498 --> 00:11:58,752
"Herein you will find my faiths,
my beliefs, and my unfoldments.

126
00:11:59,336 --> 00:12:03,298
"A complete diary of my experiments,
charts, and secret formulas.

127
00:12:04,132 --> 00:12:07,719
"In short, the sum total
of my knowledge, such as it is.

128
00:12:08,178 --> 00:12:12,808
"Perhaps you will regard my work
with ridicule or even with distaste.

129
00:12:13,392 --> 00:12:15,644
"If so, destroy these records.

130
00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:22,551
"But if you, like me,
burn with the irresistible desire...

131
00:12:22,651 --> 00:12:25,153
"to penetrate the unknown, carry on.

132
00:12:25,862 --> 00:12:29,324
"Even though the path
is cruel and torturous, carry on.

133
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:31,893
"Like every seeker after truth...

134
00:12:31,993 --> 00:12:34,955
"you will be hated, blasphemed,
and condemned.

135
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:41,962
"But mayhap where I have failed,
you will succeed.

136
00:12:42,921 --> 00:12:46,258
"You have inherited the fortune
of the Frankensteins.

137
00:12:46,425 --> 00:12:49,302
"I trust you will not
inherit their fate."

138
00:13:04,776 --> 00:13:06,153
To you, sir.

139
00:13:16,538 --> 00:13:18,040
Our Father...

140
00:13:18,457 --> 00:13:23,128
help me be a good little boy,
and bless Mummy and Daddy. Amen.

141
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:26,590
Good night, my darling.

142
00:13:29,634 --> 00:13:32,746
I'll close the curtains, madam,
so the lightning won't bother him.

143
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:35,666
Please don't close them,
'cause I like lightning.

144
00:13:35,766 --> 00:13:38,335
He isn't afraid
of anything, is he, madam?

145
00:13:38,435 --> 00:13:42,147
His father has taught him
never to be afraid, and he isn't.

146
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,386
Do you think he'll be all right here?

147
00:13:47,486 --> 00:13:51,098
Yes, madam. Nothing can happen to him.
I'll leave my door open.

148
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:52,532
Please do.

149
00:14:15,138 --> 00:14:19,334
Why do you suppose they ever built in
these beds in this strange position?

150
00:14:19,434 --> 00:14:21,295
An old superstition.

151
00:14:21,395 --> 00:14:26,233
"If the house is filled with dread,
place the beds at head-to-head."

152
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:38,704
Come on, gentlemen, see!
More bags for Frankenstein.

153
00:15:16,908 --> 00:15:19,269
- Good evening, Inspector.
- Good evening.

154
00:15:19,369 --> 00:15:22,039
- The Baron is in, I know.
- Yes, but...

155
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:25,959
A policeman.

156
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:30,589
- Herr Baron Frankenstein?
- Yes.

157
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:34,926
I am Inspector Krogh
of the district police.

158
00:15:35,343 --> 00:15:38,747
I am glad to see you, Inspector.
Benson, take the Inspector's cape.

159
00:15:38,847 --> 00:15:40,015
Yes, sir.

160
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:51,902
- Won't you come in?
- Thank you.

161
00:15:56,907 --> 00:15:59,868
- Come over and dry out by the fire.
- Thank you.

162
00:16:00,285 --> 00:16:03,497
I've been studying
some old papers of my father's.

163
00:16:04,122 --> 00:16:06,666
- Care for a brandy?
- Thank you, no.

164
00:16:07,876 --> 00:16:10,904
I have come here, Herr Baron,
to assure you of protection.

165
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:14,674
- Protection? From whom?
- From a virulent and fatal poison.

166
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:17,244
Am I to be poisoned, then?

167
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:20,180
You are poisoned already by your name.

168
00:16:20,972 --> 00:16:25,252
To the best of my knowledge, it has served
my family faithfully for over 700 years.

169
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:28,046
You recommend that I change it to,
say, Smith?

170
00:16:28,146 --> 00:16:29,589
I'm afraid that wouldn't help.

171
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:33,777
You might change your name, but you can't
erase the brand. That's indelible.

172
00:16:34,152 --> 00:16:38,156
As long as you continue to live
in this place, you're in danger.

173
00:16:39,783 --> 00:16:43,437
You're speaking in riddles, Herr Inspector.
Danger from whom?

174
00:16:43,537 --> 00:16:45,856
The Burgomaster
and his inhospitable villagers?

175
00:16:45,956 --> 00:16:50,711
I think I can guarantee to control
their animosity, but not their fears.

176
00:16:51,128 --> 00:16:53,463
What are they afraid of, ghosts?

177
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:57,008
Perhaps.

178
00:16:58,343 --> 00:17:01,038
I'm afraid I don't believe
in them. Do you?

179
00:17:01,138 --> 00:17:03,682
When they commit murder, yes.

180
00:17:06,727 --> 00:17:09,563
- You're referring to the monster.
- Perhaps.

181
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:13,066
My dear Inspector,
he was destroyed years ago.

182
00:17:15,944 --> 00:17:17,237
Perhaps.

183
00:17:19,573 --> 00:17:21,950
Can we stick to facts, Inspector?

184
00:17:22,284 --> 00:17:25,270
That my father instilled life
into a dead man is perfectly true.

185
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:27,773
But I'm also convinced
that stories of this creature...

186
00:17:27,873 --> 00:17:31,710
have been so greatly exaggerated
in the telling and the retelling...

187
00:17:32,044 --> 00:17:35,697
that the simple folk of this neighbourhood
now believe him to have been...

188
00:17:35,797 --> 00:17:38,700
the most fiendish monster
that ever walked this earth.

189
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:43,388
Do you honestly know of one criminal act
that this poor creature committed?

190
00:17:44,014 --> 00:17:46,099
Did you ever even see him?

191
00:17:47,184 --> 00:17:49,895
The most vivid recollection of my life.

192
00:17:52,898 --> 00:17:57,402
I was but a child at the time,
about the age of your own son.

193
00:17:59,321 --> 00:18:02,975
The monster had escaped
and was ravaging the countryside...

194
00:18:03,075 --> 00:18:06,036
killing, maiming, terrorising.

195
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:10,957
One night, he burst into our house.

196
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:14,461
My father took a gun and fired at him...

197
00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:17,964
but the savage brute
sent him crashing to a corner.

198
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,635
Then he grabbed me by the arm.

199
00:18:26,556 --> 00:18:31,103
One doesn't easily forget, Herr Baron,
an arm torn out by the roots.

200
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:34,398
No, I...

201
00:18:35,023 --> 00:18:38,110
My lifelong ambition
was to have been a soldier.

202
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,195
But for this...

203
00:18:40,404 --> 00:18:44,616
I, who command seven gendarmes
in a little mountain village...

204
00:18:45,742 --> 00:18:47,786
might have been a general.

205
00:18:59,047 --> 00:19:01,508
I wish I could do something to...

206
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,887
- Won't you change your mind for brandy?
- Thank you, Baron.

207
00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:10,334
I apologise if I've aroused
your sympathy...

208
00:19:10,434 --> 00:19:13,670
but I have found
that by explaining my affliction...

209
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:17,190
it ceases to be quite such a curiosity.

210
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:24,781
You said there have been other murders
committed since the destruction of the...

211
00:19:25,615 --> 00:19:27,576
- Of my father's work.
- Yes.

212
00:19:28,243 --> 00:19:30,896
- How do you account for it?
- Well, I can't.

213
00:19:30,996 --> 00:19:34,608
Neither can the special agents imported
for the purpose from Scotland Yard...

214
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,401
and the Sureté Francaise.

215
00:19:36,501 --> 00:19:39,129
There have been six, all unsolved...

216
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:41,907
and all men of some prominence
in the village.

217
00:19:42,007 --> 00:19:46,286
In each case, the autopsy disclosed that
death was caused by a violent concussion.

218
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:48,163
There were no marks on the bodies...

219
00:19:48,263 --> 00:19:52,225
except a slight discoloration or bruise
at the base of the brain.

220
00:19:52,934 --> 00:19:56,063
But the hearts of all the victims
were ruptured.

221
00:19:56,438 --> 00:19:59,107
In fact, they had burst.

222
00:20:03,362 --> 00:20:06,281
Hence the local superstition
of the murdering ghost.

223
00:20:06,782 --> 00:20:11,119
Need I add that it is always
alluded to as Frankenstein?

224
00:20:12,162 --> 00:20:15,023
Now it's rumoured that you,
like your father, are a scientist.

225
00:20:15,123 --> 00:20:18,151
The villagers have seen
the strange instruments that preceded you.

226
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:20,629
That's why I've come to warn you.

227
00:20:22,005 --> 00:20:24,741
Inspector Krogh,
I should indeed seem ungrateful...

228
00:20:24,841 --> 00:20:27,869
if I were not to thank you
for your interest in my welfare.

229
00:20:27,969 --> 00:20:30,789
But I can assure you
I am not engaged in any black magic...

230
00:20:30,889 --> 00:20:34,810
nor in the creation of monsters,
however the villagers may think.

231
00:20:35,352 --> 00:20:39,272
Nevertheless, Herr Baron,
I stand ready when you need help.

232
00:20:39,731 --> 00:20:41,525
I shall not need it.

233
00:20:41,775 --> 00:20:45,596
When you need help, you have
but to ring the alarm bell in the tower...

234
00:20:45,696 --> 00:20:49,866
and I shall hear it wherever I may be
and hasten to your assistance.

235
00:20:50,325 --> 00:20:54,162
- Good night, Herr Baron.
- Good night and thank you, Inspector.

236
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:58,609
Darling, this is Inspector Krogh
of the police.

237
00:20:58,709 --> 00:21:01,253
- How do you do?
- Madam.

238
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,905
He called to assure us
that he's at our service.

239
00:21:04,005 --> 00:21:05,741
It's very good of you, Inspector.

240
00:21:05,841 --> 00:21:08,201
Perhaps you'll honour us
one night soon at dinner.

241
00:21:08,301 --> 00:21:09,720
Madam, I...

242
00:21:10,637 --> 00:21:12,681
I shall be honoured, madam.

243
00:21:17,394 --> 00:21:18,937
Wasn't he odd?

244
00:21:19,521 --> 00:21:22,633
Yes. He said if the villagers
bothered us, he'd take a hand.

245
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:25,177
We seem to be rather
undesirable characters.

246
00:21:25,277 --> 00:21:29,431
They'll change their attitude
when they get to know us a little better.

247
00:21:31,533 --> 00:21:35,245
What a dreadful storm.
What awful lightning!

248
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:38,165
It's magnificent.

249
00:21:39,249 --> 00:21:42,794
Nothing in nature is terrifying
when one understands it.

250
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,405
Think of it, darling.

251
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:49,660
My father drew that very lightning
from heaven and forced it to his own will...

252
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,513
to bring life to a being
that he created with his own hands.

253
00:21:54,973 --> 00:21:57,100
Why should we fear anything?

254
00:22:32,135 --> 00:22:33,804
Thank you, Benson.

255
00:22:37,057 --> 00:22:39,393
Well, hello!

256
00:22:39,851 --> 00:22:41,545
Good morning, son.

257
00:22:41,645 --> 00:22:43,714
- Did you have a nice sleep?
- Yes.

258
00:22:43,814 --> 00:22:47,259
- What are you going to do now?
- I'm going out hunting.

259
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:50,737
- What are you going to get?
- Elephants and tigers.

260
00:22:50,987 --> 00:22:55,075
That's fine. You better come along
down here. There's some stairs over there.

261
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,312
You see, it isn't so bad
in daylight, is it?

262
00:22:58,412 --> 00:23:02,190
No, but I just hope we don't have
any more nights like last night.

263
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:05,569
It's nights like that
that make beautiful mornings like this.

264
00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:07,821
I'm going to look over the estate...

265
00:23:07,921 --> 00:23:10,449
and I'm going to take
my gun with me, too.

266
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:13,035
You never can tell what you'll see,
can you, Peter?

267
00:23:13,135 --> 00:23:17,472
You might see some rhinoceros
or alligators.

268
00:23:19,266 --> 00:23:20,959
What's that, Daddy?

269
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:22,853
That? That's a boar.

270
00:23:23,353 --> 00:23:24,980
Like Aunt Fanny?

271
00:23:26,148 --> 00:23:29,860
No, Peter, not like Aunt Fanny.
A wild boar.

272
00:23:30,402 --> 00:23:33,321
I hope I don't have teeth like that.

273
00:23:33,697 --> 00:23:37,267
- Why, darling?
- They'd be too hard to clean.

274
00:23:39,327 --> 00:23:42,581
Now you run along with Amelia.
Don't go far.

275
00:23:43,665 --> 00:23:45,667
- Goodbye, Peter.
- Goodbye.

276
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,575
What's that weird-looking structure
across the ravine?

277
00:23:53,675 --> 00:23:55,661
That's my father's laboratory.

278
00:23:55,761 --> 00:23:59,264
They blew the roof off
when the monster was destroyed.

279
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,392
I can't wait to see inside it.

280
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:14,131
Sulphur.

281
00:25:31,314 --> 00:25:33,316
Hey, you, come down here!

282
00:25:40,198 --> 00:25:41,908
Come on, hurry up.

283
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:51,418
Come on, get up.

284
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:55,030
Why did you try to kill me?

285
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:59,092
- I thought you came here to kill me.
- That's a fine story.

286
00:25:59,593 --> 00:26:03,830
It's all right for you people to hate me,
but attempted murder is another thing.

287
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,307
Who are you?

288
00:26:05,557 --> 00:26:07,851
My name is Ygor.

289
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,645
Let me go, Frankenstein.

290
00:26:11,063 --> 00:26:14,316
- I'm turning you over to Inspector Krogh.
- No!

291
00:26:15,901 --> 00:26:18,528
- Not give me to Krogh.
- Why?

292
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:22,115
Krogh not want dead man. Ygor is dead.

293
00:26:22,616 --> 00:26:24,743
What are you talking about?

294
00:26:25,577 --> 00:26:27,079
You see that?

295
00:26:27,454 --> 00:26:30,582
They hanged me once, Frankenstein.

296
00:26:30,832 --> 00:26:32,626
They broke my neck.

297
00:26:34,544 --> 00:26:36,380
They said I was dead.

298
00:26:37,339 --> 00:26:39,549
Then they cut me down.

299
00:26:40,634 --> 00:26:42,010
Hanged you?

300
00:26:44,471 --> 00:26:47,766
- Why did they hang you?
- Because I stole bodies...

301
00:26:49,142 --> 00:26:52,979
- they said.
- Yes. Well, what are you doing here?

302
00:26:53,188 --> 00:26:56,191
They threw me in here long ago.

303
00:26:57,484 --> 00:27:01,947
They wouldn't bury me
in holy place like churchyard...

304
00:27:02,989 --> 00:27:06,785
because I stole bodies, they said.

305
00:27:10,372 --> 00:27:12,524
So Ygor is dead.

306
00:27:19,047 --> 00:27:22,259
You Dr. Frankenstein, like your father?

307
00:27:23,218 --> 00:27:26,471
Yes, but I can't mend a broken neck.

308
00:27:27,514 --> 00:27:31,184
Nobody can mend Ygor's neck.

309
00:27:31,685 --> 00:27:33,228
It's all right.

310
00:27:37,899 --> 00:27:40,193
So you doctor?

311
00:27:40,902 --> 00:27:43,613
Yes, I'm a doctor, amongst other things.

312
00:27:44,906 --> 00:27:46,908
You come with me.

313
00:28:58,105 --> 00:28:59,690
My grandfather.

314
00:29:15,288 --> 00:29:16,665
My father.

315
00:29:23,004 --> 00:29:25,465
Is this what you wanted to show me?

316
00:30:03,128 --> 00:30:04,546
He's alive!

317
00:30:10,844 --> 00:30:13,889
- How long has he been here?
- Long time.

318
00:30:15,057 --> 00:30:17,350
He is my friend.

319
00:30:19,936 --> 00:30:22,939
He does things for me.

320
00:30:24,608 --> 00:30:28,153
- Has he always been here?
- Nearly always.

321
00:30:28,695 --> 00:30:32,240
This is place of the dead.

322
00:30:33,158 --> 00:30:35,494
We're all dead here.

323
00:30:35,952 --> 00:30:39,539
- But he's not dead.
- No, not dead.

324
00:30:40,499 --> 00:30:41,750
Asleep.

325
00:30:43,043 --> 00:30:44,336
Sick.

326
00:30:44,961 --> 00:30:47,464
He has been so many months.

327
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,841
What happened?

328
00:30:50,884 --> 00:30:52,928
- Did you...
- Oh, no.

329
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:57,140
It happened one night
when he was outside.

330
00:30:58,183 --> 00:30:59,418
Outside?

331
00:30:59,518 --> 00:31:01,812
Yes. He was...

332
00:31:03,063 --> 00:31:04,856
hunting.

333
00:31:06,191 --> 00:31:08,694
There was a great storm.

334
00:31:09,111 --> 00:31:12,030
He was standing under tree...

335
00:31:14,032 --> 00:31:16,034
when lightning strike.

336
00:31:17,077 --> 00:31:21,498
- How did he get in here?
- I find him and bring him home.

337
00:31:22,933 --> 00:31:24,768
But he walks no more.

338
00:31:25,811 --> 00:31:28,605
Evidence of trauma...

339
00:31:29,648 --> 00:31:32,067
exactly the same as a human being.

340
00:31:32,734 --> 00:31:35,595
- He was supposed to be destroyed.
- No.

341
00:31:35,695 --> 00:31:37,572
He cannot be destroyed.

342
00:31:38,323 --> 00:31:40,075
Cannot die.

343
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:45,622
Your father made him live for always.

344
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:48,875
Now he is sick.

345
00:31:49,626 --> 00:31:52,129
Make him well, Frankenstein.

346
00:31:54,381 --> 00:31:57,884
- I don't know whether I...
- Your father made him.

347
00:31:58,844 --> 00:32:02,264
And Heinrich Frankenstein
was your father, too.

348
00:32:03,223 --> 00:32:05,433
Do you mean to imply then that...

349
00:32:06,351 --> 00:32:08,353
that is my brother?

350
00:32:10,564 --> 00:32:14,067
But his mother was lightning.

351
00:32:16,653 --> 00:32:19,447
Electricity. We'll see.

352
00:32:19,739 --> 00:32:22,809
I'll get my instruments from the castle.
We'll take him up there.

353
00:32:22,909 --> 00:32:23,952
No!

354
00:32:25,203 --> 00:32:27,205
You cannot take him away.

355
00:32:30,709 --> 00:32:33,378
Just up there in the old laboratory...

356
00:32:34,171 --> 00:32:36,281
where I have light and room.

357
00:32:36,381 --> 00:32:38,658
Please. You understand.

358
00:32:38,758 --> 00:32:43,013
No one must see him, Frankenstein.

359
00:32:43,263 --> 00:32:45,807
But does anyone know that he's here?

360
00:32:47,309 --> 00:32:48,602
Good.

361
00:32:59,446 --> 00:33:01,948
And no one will know that he is here...

362
00:33:02,824 --> 00:33:06,787
until your creation, Father,
walks again.

363
00:33:32,604 --> 00:33:35,298
What's going on at Castle Frankenstein?

364
00:33:35,398 --> 00:33:38,051
The whole village is alarmed
with anxiety.

365
00:33:38,151 --> 00:33:40,679
- Our men report nothing but quiet.
- Quiet?

366
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:44,616
There's nothing so ominous as quiet.
Besides, it isn't quiet.

367
00:33:44,991 --> 00:33:46,893
From the cemetery on Crag Hill...

368
00:33:46,993 --> 00:33:50,747
Hans Stenble can see Castle Frankenstein
with his field glasses.

369
00:33:51,164 --> 00:33:55,794
The servants have been moving large
crates and boxes into the old laboratory.

370
00:33:56,294 --> 00:33:58,797
They even have old Ygor helping them.

371
00:34:00,132 --> 00:34:02,868
We Frankensteinians
are as nervous as cats.

372
00:34:02,968 --> 00:34:04,703
We grovel at the howl of a wolf.

373
00:34:04,803 --> 00:34:06,955
When the wind slams
the door or a shutter...

374
00:34:07,055 --> 00:34:10,208
we tremble in our shoes
and hide ourselves like frightened rabbits.

375
00:34:10,308 --> 00:34:12,961
And always will
with a Frankenstein in our midst.

376
00:34:13,061 --> 00:34:15,255
What's he doing?
That's all we want to know.

377
00:34:15,355 --> 00:34:16,715
Yes, we want to know.

378
00:34:16,815 --> 00:34:19,134
Let's get Ygor here
and make him tell us.

379
00:34:19,234 --> 00:34:20,318
Yes!

380
00:34:48,013 --> 00:34:50,307
All right, Ygor, make it fast.

381
00:34:52,851 --> 00:34:54,019
Ready?

382
00:34:54,895 --> 00:34:56,404
Ready!

383
00:36:25,485 --> 00:36:26,553
No!

384
00:36:26,653 --> 00:36:29,181
What's the matter with you?
What are you doing?

385
00:36:29,281 --> 00:36:31,616
He cannot come in here. No one.

386
00:36:33,034 --> 00:36:36,229
You want me to make him well?
Very well, then. I'll need some help.

387
00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:37,898
This man is not just my servant.

388
00:36:37,998 --> 00:36:40,942
He's been with me for years,
helping me with my experiments.

389
00:36:41,042 --> 00:36:43,195
I need him now to make notes.

390
00:36:43,295 --> 00:36:45,755
All right, I'll not make him well.

391
00:36:50,385 --> 00:36:52,971
But if he tells...

392
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,922
All right, come along, Benson.

393
00:37:18,647 --> 00:37:20,565
Get your notes, Benson.

394
00:37:27,113 --> 00:37:28,698
Iris contracted.

395
00:37:29,282 --> 00:37:31,076
Marked sclerectasia.

396
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,411
Mental abnormality.

397
00:37:35,747 --> 00:37:38,792
Considerable osteodermia
in the frontal region.

398
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:42,170
Apparently these
are the exterior electrodes.

399
00:37:42,754 --> 00:37:47,008
The means by which my father
inducted the vital energy into the body.

400
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:51,538
Systolic pressure, over 300.

401
00:37:53,598 --> 00:37:57,018
Diastolic, over 220. Three times normal.

402
00:38:07,279 --> 00:38:10,782
Definite hyperpituitary. Minus 65.

403
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:15,537
That accounts for his great size.

404
00:38:25,338 --> 00:38:28,633
No human heart
could possibly function like that...

405
00:38:29,134 --> 00:38:31,303
especially in his condition.

406
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:34,639
It's beating at over 250 to the minute.

407
00:38:44,691 --> 00:38:46,818
He's completely superhuman.

408
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,510
Get your notes, Benson.

409
00:39:35,533 --> 00:39:37,827
Left ventricular preponderance.

410
00:39:38,578 --> 00:39:40,497
And look at this, Benson.

411
00:39:40,789 --> 00:39:42,816
- Do you know what those are?
- No.

412
00:39:42,916 --> 00:39:45,585
Bullets. Two bullets in his heart.

413
00:39:46,419 --> 00:39:48,171
But he still lives.

414
00:40:01,893 --> 00:40:04,562
I've never seen blood like that before.

415
00:40:05,522 --> 00:40:07,274
Polymorphocellular.

416
00:40:07,607 --> 00:40:09,442
Extreme hemachrosis.

417
00:40:09,776 --> 00:40:12,862
The alpha leukocytes
apparently do not dissolve.

418
00:40:13,655 --> 00:40:18,285
The structure of the blood is quite
different from that of a normal human being.

419
00:40:18,702 --> 00:40:21,663
The cells seem
to be battling one another...

420
00:40:21,871 --> 00:40:24,332
as if they had a conscious life
of their own.

421
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:29,279
- What was in those boxes?
- All kinds of things. Machines.

422
00:40:29,379 --> 00:40:31,840
- What kind of machines?
- All kinds.

423
00:40:32,173 --> 00:40:35,760
Wheels turn around,
electric lightnings come out.

424
00:40:36,344 --> 00:40:39,055
Bottles, big ones, little ones.

425
00:40:39,514 --> 00:40:41,266
Medicine. All kinds.

426
00:40:41,766 --> 00:40:44,561
He doctor.
I don't understand his business.

427
00:40:46,438 --> 00:40:48,131
I am blacksmith.

428
00:40:48,231 --> 00:40:50,900
Body snatcher, you mean?

429
00:40:51,151 --> 00:40:52,235
Yes.

430
00:40:53,653 --> 00:40:56,197
Has he asked you to rob any graves?

431
00:40:56,823 --> 00:40:59,784
- To get him a body?
- No!

432
00:40:59,951 --> 00:41:04,773
Tell us the truth, or we'll hang you again
and make a better job of it next time.

433
00:41:04,873 --> 00:41:07,943
No, you no can hang me again. Can they?

434
00:41:08,043 --> 00:41:11,279
No, that's been settled.
You were hanged and pronounced dead.

435
00:41:11,379 --> 00:41:13,114
But he was not dead.

436
00:41:13,214 --> 00:41:15,617
He was pronounced dead by Dr. Burgher.

437
00:41:15,717 --> 00:41:18,995
And all the others Burgher's
pronounced dead for the last 30 years...

438
00:41:19,095 --> 00:41:21,348
have been dead, haven't they?

439
00:41:21,723 --> 00:41:25,836
If Ygor came to life again,
it's the devil's work, not the court's.

440
00:41:25,936 --> 00:41:29,339
You mean that if he commits another crime,
he can't be hanged again?

441
00:41:29,439 --> 00:41:31,775
- Yes, but...
- I do nothing.

442
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:33,985
I help Frankenstein.

443
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:37,072
He good man. He pay me money.

444
00:41:37,238 --> 00:41:38,974
Well, you watch him.

445
00:41:39,074 --> 00:41:43,828
And if he starts to do anything
like his father and you don't tell us...

446
00:41:44,037 --> 00:41:46,247
I'll see that you hang again.

447
00:41:47,165 --> 00:41:49,292
You? Alone?

448
00:41:51,294 --> 00:41:55,465
It took eight men before
to say I was to be hanged.

449
00:41:56,216 --> 00:41:58,785
The same eight will find you
guilty again.

450
00:41:58,885 --> 00:41:59,928
So?

451
00:42:01,221 --> 00:42:03,832
- The same eight aren't here, Weber.
- No?

452
00:42:03,932 --> 00:42:07,936
Well, I'm one of the eight,
and I'll be one again with pleasure.

453
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,523
You, Neumüller.

454
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,109
You were one.

455
00:42:14,401 --> 00:42:15,819
And I, too.

456
00:42:16,152 --> 00:42:19,864
Yes. You, too, Lang.

457
00:42:20,532 --> 00:42:22,909
That's right. I remember.

458
00:42:24,494 --> 00:42:26,621
That's all here now?

459
00:42:27,622 --> 00:42:28,665
Yes.

460
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,209
The other six are all dead.

461
00:42:34,629 --> 00:42:36,881
They die. Dead.

462
00:42:37,549 --> 00:42:39,634
I die. Live.

463
00:42:41,094 --> 00:42:43,555
Quiet! That'll be all, Ygor.

464
00:42:44,097 --> 00:42:47,100
Go back to Castle Frankenstein
and be careful.

465
00:42:54,774 --> 00:42:58,194
- You spit on me!
- I am sorry. I cough.

466
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:01,489
You see, bone get stuck in my throat.

467
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:17,697
The results of my extensive examinations
establish beyond doubt...

468
00:43:17,797 --> 00:43:20,408
that the creature
was brought to life originally...

469
00:43:20,508 --> 00:43:23,553
by an electrical impulse
of terrifying potency.

470
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:29,601
It appears that my father thought
that he could extract from lightning...

471
00:43:30,185 --> 00:43:34,064
some super-violet ray
of life-giving properties.

472
00:43:36,024 --> 00:43:39,319
From a careful analysis
of his electrical hookup...

473
00:43:40,195 --> 00:43:43,473
I've learned that he actually
attracted cosmic rays...

474
00:43:43,573 --> 00:43:46,977
which neither he, nor anyone else
in the world of science at that time...

475
00:43:47,077 --> 00:43:48,745
even knew existed.

476
00:43:49,496 --> 00:43:52,732
Of course, since then,
many of our most profound scientists...

477
00:43:52,832 --> 00:43:57,462
have come to believe that these rays
are actually the very source of life itself.

478
00:43:57,671 --> 00:44:00,256
This creature is indeed a monster.

479
00:44:04,594 --> 00:44:09,249
There is not one part of his physical being
that's like that of human beings.

480
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:11,351
From his warped brain...

481
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:15,547
down to the tiniest argumentative cell
of his huge carcass...

482
00:44:15,647 --> 00:44:17,190
he's unearthly.

483
00:44:18,858 --> 00:44:22,429
Every fantastic story told of him
by the people of Frankenstein...

484
00:44:22,529 --> 00:44:25,073
I now believe to be absolutely true.

485
00:44:27,951 --> 00:44:29,661
I, as a man...

486
00:44:33,164 --> 00:44:34,874
should destroy him.

487
00:44:39,796 --> 00:44:41,589
But as a scientist...

488
00:44:42,674 --> 00:44:46,953
I should do everything in my power
to bring him back to conscious life...

489
00:44:47,053 --> 00:44:50,348
so that the world can study
his abnormal functions.

490
00:44:53,226 --> 00:44:55,645
That would vindicate my father...

491
00:44:56,396 --> 00:44:59,691
and his name would be enshrined
among the immortals.

492
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,532
Benson, turn on the generator.

493
00:45:47,781 --> 00:45:49,866
- Stop!
- Quiet, you fool!

494
00:46:44,129 --> 00:46:47,215
It's no good, Ygor.
I've done everything I can.

495
00:46:47,632 --> 00:46:50,760
I'm afraid we'll never get him
out of this coma.

496
00:46:51,052 --> 00:46:52,637
Come on, Benson.

497
00:46:53,805 --> 00:46:55,599
Take off these electrodes.

498
00:46:58,884 --> 00:47:01,954
I'm not going to work
at Castle Frankenstein any longer.

499
00:47:02,054 --> 00:47:05,724
I've seen enough to make me suspicious.
I'm going to quit.

500
00:47:06,183 --> 00:47:07,726
No, you're not.

501
00:47:08,018 --> 00:47:11,546
You'll stay there and report to me
everything you see and hear.

502
00:47:11,646 --> 00:47:14,274
I'll call there myself this afternoon.

503
00:47:15,317 --> 00:47:17,394
You'll be well repaid.

504
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:22,532
Now go back and don't tell anyone
you've seen me.

505
00:47:23,033 --> 00:47:25,452
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

506
00:47:28,747 --> 00:47:33,460
I'd like very much to visit the village,
but I'm ashamed to say I don't dare.

507
00:47:33,585 --> 00:47:37,881
I think you're very wise, madam.
There's a definite feeling of tension there...

508
00:47:38,006 --> 00:47:42,411
and I'm sure you'll be much better off
not to risk the discourtesy of the villagers.

509
00:47:42,511 --> 00:47:44,621
Yes, that's what Wolf said.

510
00:47:44,721 --> 00:47:47,624
I suspect the Baron, too,
finds time heavy on his hands here.

511
00:47:47,724 --> 00:47:51,395
No, never. He's almost constantly
in his laboratory.

512
00:47:52,145 --> 00:47:53,714
- Laboratory?
- Yes.

513
00:47:53,814 --> 00:47:56,341
He's fixed over his father's
old one, you know.

514
00:47:56,441 --> 00:47:58,610
He's deep in some experiment.

515
00:47:59,444 --> 00:48:02,014
I see. What sort of experiment?

516
00:48:02,114 --> 00:48:05,951
I'm sure I don't know.
I never bother him at times like this.

517
00:48:06,284 --> 00:48:07,894
He's terribly preoccupied now.

518
00:48:07,994 --> 00:48:11,315
But as soon as his problem's solved,
he'll be as gay as a lark again.

519
00:48:11,415 --> 00:48:12,566
He's like that.

520
00:48:12,666 --> 00:48:15,068
- Is he in his laboratory now?
- No.

521
00:48:15,168 --> 00:48:17,362
He came in to lunch
looking grey as a ghost.

522
00:48:17,462 --> 00:48:19,239
I could see he was on pins
and needles...

523
00:48:19,339 --> 00:48:22,367
so I suggested that he go out
into the open air for a while.

524
00:48:22,467 --> 00:48:23,952
He's been gone for hours.

525
00:48:24,052 --> 00:48:28,415
- You don't mind being left alone?
- Not in the daytime, but at night...

526
00:48:28,515 --> 00:48:31,977
- Good afternoon, Inspector.
- Good afternoon, Herr Baron.

527
00:48:33,729 --> 00:48:36,715
- I trust you enjoyed your walk.
- Yes, very much.

528
00:48:36,815 --> 00:48:40,344
There's nothing like a good walk
through the woods for clearing one's mind.

529
00:48:40,444 --> 00:48:42,179
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

530
00:48:42,279 --> 00:48:46,199
Yes, you scientists must have
to have clear minds and steady nerves.

531
00:48:46,908 --> 00:48:50,979
The Baroness has just been telling me
that you're knee-deep in experiments.

532
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:54,207
- Yes.
- And working in your father's laboratory?

533
00:48:54,916 --> 00:48:57,444
The villagers call it
"the Monster's home."

534
00:48:57,544 --> 00:49:00,238
Haven't seen him stalking about
by any chance, have you?

535
00:49:00,338 --> 00:49:01,423
No.

536
00:49:02,549 --> 00:49:05,761
- I fear he'll never stalk again.
- That's a relief.

537
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:09,039
But I'm curious to know
why you chose that place to work.

538
00:49:09,139 --> 00:49:11,833
- It was my father's.
- But without a roof?

539
00:49:11,933 --> 00:49:14,352
I sealed it up with some heavy canvas.

540
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:16,922
Don't the sulphur fumes bother you?

541
00:49:17,022 --> 00:49:19,800
- No, not at all.
- Sulphur fumes?

542
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:23,845
Forgive me, perhaps I shouldn't have
mentioned that. I thought madam knew.

543
00:49:23,945 --> 00:49:27,432
- Tell me.
- You see, our family history states...

544
00:49:27,532 --> 00:49:30,978
that the structure was built by the Romans
over a natural sulphur pit...

545
00:49:31,078 --> 00:49:32,980
and used by them as mineral baths.

546
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,874
One of the first
health resorts, perhaps.

547
00:49:36,374 --> 00:49:37,834
Health resort.

548
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,630
Yes, possibly.

549
00:49:42,005 --> 00:49:46,076
But during the succeeding centuries, the
boiling sulphur increased in its intensity...

550
00:49:46,176 --> 00:49:49,538
until now, I believe,
it is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.

551
00:49:49,638 --> 00:49:51,248
- Exactly.
- Even the stoutest Roman...

552
00:49:51,348 --> 00:49:52,833
couldn't venture into that today...

553
00:49:52,933 --> 00:49:56,478
without being parboiled to the bones
in just a few moments.

554
00:49:56,895 --> 00:50:00,382
Wolf, you do pick the strangest places.

555
00:50:00,482 --> 00:50:03,026
I'd like to see how you fixed it up.

556
00:50:03,944 --> 00:50:07,239
I'll have you come there some time
and parboil you.

557
00:50:17,582 --> 00:50:19,918
Well, hello!

558
00:50:20,544 --> 00:50:23,588
- Mother, may I come in?
- Come on in, son.

559
00:50:24,339 --> 00:50:26,116
Peter, this is Inspector Krogh.

560
00:50:26,216 --> 00:50:28,719
- How do you do?
- How do you do, sir?

561
00:50:29,052 --> 00:50:32,831
You're not supposed to shake hands
with a left hand.

562
00:50:32,931 --> 00:50:35,475
I'm sorry. That was very rude of me.

563
00:50:36,601 --> 00:50:39,212
You're not supposed
to wear gloves in the house, either.

564
00:50:39,312 --> 00:50:40,756
- Son.
- Sorry again.

565
00:50:40,856 --> 00:50:43,884
But, you see, I only have one real arm.
This one isn't mine.

566
00:50:43,984 --> 00:50:45,694
Well, whose is it?

567
00:50:46,737 --> 00:50:50,782
You see, Inspector Krogh
lost his other real arm...

568
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:53,326
in the war.

569
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:55,412
He's a soldier.

570
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:00,375
- Are you a general?
- No, he's more than a general.

571
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,170
He's an inspector.

572
00:51:04,296 --> 00:51:08,175
Well, I'm a soldier myself,
and I've been hunting all day long.

573
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:10,494
Hunting? Did you get anything?

574
00:51:10,594 --> 00:51:13,705
Yes, a few elephants and a few tigers.

575
00:51:13,805 --> 00:51:15,916
Did you have a nice long nap, darling?

576
00:51:16,016 --> 00:51:17,851
No, not a very long nap.

577
00:51:18,185 --> 00:51:20,771
A giant came in here and woke me up.

578
00:51:21,021 --> 00:51:24,274
A giant? What an imagination.

579
00:51:24,566 --> 00:51:27,135
No, Amelia, it wasn't imagination.

580
00:51:27,235 --> 00:51:30,263
It was a giant and he woke me up.

581
00:51:30,363 --> 00:51:33,241
And when I got up,
he had a hold of my arm.

582
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,229
Did you chase him away with your gun?

583
00:51:37,329 --> 00:51:39,606
No, he was a nice giant.

584
00:51:39,706 --> 00:51:42,918
I gave him my picture book
and then he went away.

585
00:51:43,418 --> 00:51:46,046
Are there lots of giants around here?

586
00:51:46,296 --> 00:51:48,548
Only one that I ever heard of.

587
00:51:49,049 --> 00:51:51,259
That must have been him, then.

588
00:51:52,844 --> 00:51:54,096
Perhaps.

589
00:51:58,308 --> 00:52:01,169
You're pretty much
of a giant yourself, aren't you?

590
00:52:01,269 --> 00:52:03,271
Aren't we getting heavy?

591
00:52:04,064 --> 00:52:05,799
Excuse me, Inspector.

592
00:52:05,899 --> 00:52:08,677
I'll take him up to the nursery.
It's almost his suppertime.

593
00:52:08,777 --> 00:52:10,095
Here we go.

594
00:52:10,195 --> 00:52:12,347
It must be that book
Jack the Giant Killer...

595
00:52:12,447 --> 00:52:15,659
that's got into his head
with his great imagination.

596
00:52:23,208 --> 00:52:25,544
Here we go up the big mountain.

597
00:52:27,587 --> 00:52:29,172
Duck your head.

598
00:52:42,102 --> 00:52:44,438
Hold tight. We're almost there.

599
00:52:48,442 --> 00:52:49,818
Here we are.

600
00:52:52,904 --> 00:52:54,348
Now, Peter...

601
00:52:54,448 --> 00:52:58,160
I want you to tell me
all about the elephants, the tigers...

602
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:00,245
and that giant.

603
00:53:01,872 --> 00:53:04,733
Really, Daddy,
there weren't any elephants and tigers.

604
00:53:04,833 --> 00:53:06,877
I just made-believe that.

605
00:53:07,544 --> 00:53:10,489
- But what about the giant?
- What giant?

606
00:53:10,589 --> 00:53:13,133
The one you gave your storybook to.

607
00:53:13,759 --> 00:53:15,469
He's real.

608
00:53:16,344 --> 00:53:18,263
What did he look like?

609
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:23,518
He was a great big man
with a hairy coat on.

610
00:53:24,061 --> 00:53:27,230
And he walked like this.

611
00:53:31,026 --> 00:53:32,552
What an imagination!

612
00:53:32,652 --> 00:53:34,988
Yes. See you later, son.

613
00:53:37,157 --> 00:53:38,909
What a boy!

614
00:53:44,581 --> 00:53:46,525
Going out, Herr Baron?

615
00:53:46,625 --> 00:53:50,195
Yes, I just remembered a thing
I have to check in my laboratory.

616
00:53:50,295 --> 00:53:54,116
I almost forgot the time.
I'm getting sort of absent-minded.

617
00:53:54,216 --> 00:53:56,968
I'll have to hurry, if you'll excuse me.

618
00:54:06,853 --> 00:54:07,896
Ygor!

619
00:55:04,286 --> 00:55:05,828
Ygor!

620
00:55:09,685 --> 00:55:11,274
Ygor!

621
00:59:03,421 --> 00:59:05,548
How did he get out of here?

622
00:59:05,882 --> 00:59:08,510
You make him well with your lightning.

623
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:11,554
After you go, he get up and walk.

624
00:59:12,097 --> 00:59:14,949
Now he's all right again.

625
00:59:17,018 --> 00:59:18,144
Come.

626
00:59:19,396 --> 00:59:21,064
Good man.

627
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:31,474
He must never get out again. Never.

628
00:59:31,574 --> 00:59:34,119
He just do what I tell him, always.

629
00:59:34,577 --> 00:59:35,703
See?

630
00:59:36,704 --> 00:59:37,747
Go.

631
00:59:47,549 --> 00:59:49,884
No one must know that he's here.

632
00:59:50,176 --> 00:59:54,039
No one know now, but you and Benson man.

633
00:59:54,139 --> 00:59:55,623
He'll never tell.

634
00:59:55,723 --> 00:59:58,309
No, he will never tell.

635
01:00:12,157 --> 01:00:13,283
Come.

636
01:00:23,501 --> 01:00:24,586
Igor.

637
01:00:25,754 --> 01:00:28,740
Ygor, I made him walk,
but I haven't made him well.

638
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:31,176
He isn't well here. You understand?

639
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,095
I must continue my experiments.

640
01:00:34,637 --> 01:00:37,056
He's well enough for me...

641
01:00:37,557 --> 01:00:40,351
and you no touch him again.

642
01:00:44,814 --> 01:00:48,443
If you want him to be well,
you must keep him here always.

643
01:00:48,943 --> 01:00:52,280
- Understand?
- I keep him here.

644
01:01:27,732 --> 01:01:29,175
You sent for me, sir?

645
01:01:29,275 --> 01:01:31,845
Yes, Benson.
Inspector Krogh is still in the library.

646
01:01:31,945 --> 01:01:34,723
I can't stand his suspicious look,
so I called you in here.

647
01:01:34,823 --> 01:01:35,932
Yes, sir.

648
01:01:36,032 --> 01:01:39,060
- Benson, it's alive!
- Alive? You mean...

649
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:41,813
- Yes, alive!
- But you said our experiment...

650
01:01:41,913 --> 01:01:46,776
I know. I, too, at first thought that we
failed, but I've actually seen it walk.

651
01:01:46,876 --> 01:01:48,002
Walk?

652
01:01:49,045 --> 01:01:51,214
It's like some huge animal.

653
01:01:51,965 --> 01:01:54,717
Never in my life
have I known cold fear...

654
01:01:55,718 --> 01:01:59,055
until that moment
that I felt his hand on my shoulder.

655
01:01:59,431 --> 01:02:02,559
I was like a child's doll
in those huge hands.

656
01:02:03,435 --> 01:02:07,188
He could have crushed me
as I would have crushed an eggshell.

657
01:02:07,355 --> 01:02:10,316
- How did you escape him, sir?
- Ygor came in.

658
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:13,845
It's amazing the control
he exercises over that thing.

659
01:02:13,945 --> 01:02:17,057
It's hypnosis,
or something more elemental perhaps.

660
01:02:17,157 --> 01:02:20,393
- What are you going to do about it?
- Do? Continue my experiments.

661
01:02:20,493 --> 01:02:22,912
- But what if he...
- I'm not worried.

662
01:02:23,163 --> 01:02:27,250
He's dangerous, of course,
but he loves Ygor and obeys him.

663
01:02:27,792 --> 01:02:29,986
My problem is how to make Ygor obey me.

664
01:02:30,086 --> 01:02:32,964
But what about madam
and Master Peter, sir?

665
01:02:33,673 --> 01:02:35,784
Oh, yes, I'll have to send them away.

666
01:02:35,884 --> 01:02:38,411
I'll suggest tonight
that they make a trip to Brussels.

667
01:02:38,511 --> 01:02:40,580
Get some tickets
for the noon train tomorrow.

668
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:44,793
I hope you forgive me speaking my way,
but I've served you for many years.

669
01:02:44,893 --> 01:02:48,922
I think it would be better if you called in
Inspector Krogh and told him everything.

670
01:02:49,022 --> 01:02:50,523
No, I will not!

671
01:02:51,566 --> 01:02:55,845
I have begun this thing and I'll finish it.
I'll not be halted by anything...

672
01:02:55,945 --> 01:02:59,683
till I'm the complete master of this living,
breathing, intelligent creature...

673
01:02:59,783 --> 01:03:01,826
my father dreamed of creating.

674
01:03:44,577 --> 01:03:48,081
- Herr Neumüller. How are you?
- Fine, Schmidt.

675
01:05:35,446 --> 01:05:38,532
- Thank you.
- I hope you don't feel I'm an intruder.

676
01:05:38,657 --> 01:05:40,492
Not at all, Inspector.

677
01:05:40,826 --> 01:05:44,063
Well, I practically invited
myself to dinner, but I...

678
01:05:44,163 --> 01:05:45,397
No, of course not.

679
01:05:45,497 --> 01:05:48,317
It's a great pleasure to have you.
You're our first guest.

680
01:05:48,417 --> 01:05:53,113
I never thought I'd have the privilege
of being entertained at Castle Frankenstein.

681
01:05:53,213 --> 01:05:57,801
No, it's a great pleasure to have you here.
You see, you're our first guest.

682
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:02,097
You just said that, didn't you, dear?

683
01:06:02,473 --> 01:06:03,974
Well, you are.

684
01:06:06,268 --> 01:06:09,338
Where is Benson?
Why isn't he serving dinner?

685
01:06:09,438 --> 01:06:11,173
We don't know, madam.

686
01:06:11,273 --> 01:06:14,301
He went up to the nursery
for the baby's supper tray...

687
01:06:14,401 --> 01:06:16,653
and we haven't seen him since.

688
01:06:17,946 --> 01:06:19,948
Have you seen him, Wolf?

689
01:06:20,115 --> 01:06:22,242
Yes, dear.

690
01:06:23,243 --> 01:06:27,039
I sent him over to the laboratory
to get some notes for me...

691
01:06:27,372 --> 01:06:30,334
that I want to work
on after dinner tonight.

692
01:06:30,793 --> 01:06:32,461
But how long ago?

693
01:06:34,546 --> 01:06:37,491
Perhaps my instructions
were a little complicated...

694
01:06:37,591 --> 01:06:39,284
and he may have become confused.

695
01:06:39,384 --> 01:06:42,221
You know, he hates to make mistakes.

696
01:06:45,432 --> 01:06:47,167
That awful knocker.

697
01:06:47,267 --> 01:06:49,503
Fritz, will you see who it is, please?

698
01:06:49,603 --> 01:06:52,339
Wolf, couldn't we install
an old-fashioned doorbell?

699
01:06:52,439 --> 01:06:54,675
That boom almost makes me
jump out of my skin.

700
01:06:54,775 --> 01:06:56,385
Yes, dear, I'll have a bell put in.

701
01:06:56,485 --> 01:07:00,472
The knocker must have been used in
the old days to arouse the entire household.

702
01:07:00,572 --> 01:07:04,326
A sort of call to arms
in times of danger.

703
01:07:06,995 --> 01:07:08,897
It's one of your men, Inspector.

704
01:07:08,997 --> 01:07:12,626
There has been an accident in the village.
A sudden death.

705
01:07:13,210 --> 01:07:15,754
He requested that you come at once.

706
01:07:16,755 --> 01:07:19,383
I'm terribly sorry. Please excuse me.

707
01:07:19,591 --> 01:07:23,912
What a shame to leave a delicious dinner
like this for so sordid a thing as...

708
01:07:24,012 --> 01:07:26,790
I trust that nothing has happened
to your butler, madam.

709
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:28,767
- Thank you.
- Good night.

710
01:07:29,059 --> 01:07:30,227
Baron.

711
01:07:40,279 --> 01:07:44,475
I think you ought to try and find Benson.
I'm terribly worried about him.

712
01:07:44,575 --> 01:07:46,935
- Yes, I will.
- But don't go alone.

713
01:07:47,035 --> 01:07:49,079
Silly. I'll be all right.

714
01:08:05,888 --> 01:08:08,682
- What's the matter with him?
- He's asleep.

715
01:08:10,058 --> 01:08:12,186
- Have you seen Benson?
- Yes.

716
01:08:12,519 --> 01:08:14,630
- When?
- About two hours ago.

717
01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:16,231
- Where?
- Here.

718
01:08:16,774 --> 01:08:19,860
He say you tell him monster walk again.

719
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:21,820
He came to see.

720
01:08:23,322 --> 01:08:24,823
Monster walk.

721
01:08:25,282 --> 01:08:27,284
Benson run!

722
01:08:28,035 --> 01:08:30,562
Where did he run to?
He isn't at the castle.

723
01:08:30,662 --> 01:08:33,582
He just run away in the woods.

724
01:08:35,167 --> 01:08:37,711
That thing's enough to scare anyone.

725
01:08:38,378 --> 01:08:41,048
I didn't think Benson would come here.

726
01:08:42,216 --> 01:08:44,993
Are you telling me the truth?
You didn't kill him?

727
01:08:45,093 --> 01:08:46,303
No.

728
01:08:47,638 --> 01:08:52,142
Why, I scare him to death.
I don't have to kill him to death.

729
01:09:04,321 --> 01:09:07,616
Where does the ladder
into the sulphur pit lead to?

730
01:09:08,742 --> 01:09:11,120
- A cave.
- A cave?

731
01:09:11,954 --> 01:09:14,498
It's warm. We stay there in winter.

732
01:09:16,458 --> 01:09:19,211
- Where does the cave lead to?
- Just cave.

733
01:09:39,815 --> 01:09:42,484
My deepest sympathies, Frau Neumüller.

734
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:44,428
How did it happen?

735
01:09:44,528 --> 01:09:47,056
He must have been asleep
and fallen off his wagon.

736
01:09:47,156 --> 01:09:50,993
The wheels passed over his legs
breaking them, and crushing his chest.

737
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:52,494
See here?

738
01:09:54,037 --> 01:09:58,625
Will you all leave while Dr. Burgher
and I make out the death certificates?

739
01:10:11,763 --> 01:10:13,891
Any other marks or bruises?

740
01:10:14,516 --> 01:10:16,768
Examine the back of the neck.

741
01:10:19,229 --> 01:10:21,465
- You don't think that...
- Perhaps.

742
01:10:21,565 --> 01:10:24,051
We won't know
until you perform an autopsy.

743
01:10:24,151 --> 01:10:27,112
Examine the heart,
and report to me at once.

744
01:10:51,595 --> 01:10:55,015
- What happened to Benson?
- I don't know, really, dear.

745
01:10:56,350 --> 01:10:58,477
I've been working him
pretty hard lately.

746
01:10:58,602 --> 01:11:01,171
Maybe he just wanted to go out
and get drunk.

747
01:11:01,271 --> 01:11:03,007
But Benson doesn't drink.

748
01:11:03,107 --> 01:11:05,384
Well, perhaps he does sometimes.

749
01:11:05,484 --> 01:11:08,220
He'll be back in the morning
bright and early. You'll see.

750
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:11,573
- Don't worry about him.
- It's you I'm worried about.

751
01:11:12,116 --> 01:11:13,909
You aren't yourself.

752
01:11:14,368 --> 01:11:16,829
Are you keeping something from me?

753
01:11:20,958 --> 01:11:22,376
No, darling.

754
01:11:23,752 --> 01:11:26,380
Is this place getting on your nerves?

755
01:11:26,922 --> 01:11:28,757
I hate it here, Wolf.

756
01:11:29,258 --> 01:11:32,594
- I'm terribly afraid all the time.
- I'm sorry, dear.

757
01:11:33,554 --> 01:11:36,165
I'm going to send you and Peter away
in the morning.

758
01:11:36,265 --> 01:11:40,085
I want you to take a trip to Brussels,
and I'll follow you in a few days.

759
01:11:40,185 --> 01:11:42,796
I've tried so desperately
to match your bravery, but...

760
01:11:42,896 --> 01:11:44,148
My dear.

761
01:11:50,404 --> 01:11:52,114
I'll be all right.

762
01:11:54,074 --> 01:11:55,826
There's a good girl.

763
01:11:59,997 --> 01:12:02,316
- Where are you going?
- To get Peter.

764
01:12:02,416 --> 01:12:05,377
I'll feel better having him
in here with me.

765
01:13:21,537 --> 01:13:22,579
No!

766
01:14:03,495 --> 01:14:06,607
Good morning, Inspector.
You're up rather early, aren't you?

767
01:14:06,707 --> 01:14:10,319
You're early yourself, Baron.
I came to inquire about your butler.

768
01:14:10,419 --> 01:14:12,905
Have you found him, dead or alive?

769
01:14:13,005 --> 01:14:17,159
No, but he'll be back.
He's done this sort of thing before.

770
01:14:17,259 --> 01:14:20,079
These sudden disappearances.
Can I give you a light?

771
01:14:20,179 --> 01:14:21,680
Thank you, no.

772
01:14:23,265 --> 01:14:26,502
He was in the war, you know.
He was wounded in the head.

773
01:14:26,602 --> 01:14:29,480
It makes him rather funny at times.

774
01:14:29,688 --> 01:14:31,048
But don't worry about him.

775
01:14:31,148 --> 01:14:34,093
I'm going down to the village.
Will you come along with me?

776
01:14:34,193 --> 01:14:36,387
The village? There's not a shop open.

777
01:14:36,487 --> 01:14:39,656
No, I'm going to the railroad station.

778
01:14:40,908 --> 01:14:44,369
My wife and child are going away
for a slight holiday.

779
01:14:45,162 --> 01:14:46,205
So?

780
01:14:48,248 --> 01:14:52,027
So, you see, I have to do
all the arranging myself...

781
01:14:52,127 --> 01:14:56,573
- now that that stupid Benson's gone.
- I'm afraid I must ask you not to go, Baron.

782
01:14:56,673 --> 01:14:59,134
Neither you, nor your wife, or child.

783
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:03,539
That accidental death that called me
from your dinner last night...

784
01:15:03,639 --> 01:15:05,599
was another burst heart.

785
01:15:07,184 --> 01:15:08,393
Listen.

786
01:15:23,450 --> 01:15:26,912
Ygor, shut up!
He's been playing that thing all night.

787
01:15:27,496 --> 01:15:29,665
There's a mob at your gate.

788
01:15:30,124 --> 01:15:34,128
They have a strange notion
that you had something to do with it.

789
01:15:34,628 --> 01:15:36,255
Silly, isn't it?

790
01:15:37,756 --> 01:15:41,493
Silly? They're mad.
I'll go down there and tell them so.

791
01:15:41,593 --> 01:15:43,887
- No, you won't go, Baron.
- Why?

792
01:15:44,513 --> 01:15:46,348
We'll talk it over...

793
01:15:47,099 --> 01:15:48,350
inside.

794
01:15:48,809 --> 01:15:51,437
All right, if you like.

795
01:16:00,112 --> 01:16:02,114
- Inspector.
- Madam.

796
01:16:04,825 --> 01:16:09,563
My dear, I assume from the Inspector's
attitude and pointed implications...

797
01:16:09,663 --> 01:16:11,315
- That I'm under arrest.
- Arrest?

798
01:16:11,415 --> 01:16:13,650
It appears we've returned
to the Middle Ages.

799
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:17,696
The villagers have laid siege to the castle
and are crying out for blood!

800
01:16:17,796 --> 01:16:18,864
Madam, I...

801
01:16:18,964 --> 01:16:21,950
A man is murdered a mile away,
and do you know what killed him?

802
01:16:22,050 --> 01:16:23,077
My name.

803
01:16:23,177 --> 01:16:26,080
The very name of Frankenstein
burst his heart.

804
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:29,500
And now the happy little villagers
are clamouring for my blood!

805
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:32,336
I'm afraid the Baron
is in a humorous mood this morning.

806
01:16:32,436 --> 01:16:36,340
I suppose it has its humorous side,
but you're not under arrest, madam.

807
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:40,177
I'm merely here to guarantee you protection
against any unprovoked assault.

808
01:16:40,277 --> 01:16:42,029
Unprovoked assault!

809
01:16:44,156 --> 01:16:47,309
Inspector, you mean it isn't safe
for us to leave?

810
01:16:47,409 --> 01:16:49,228
I'm afraid not, madam.

811
01:16:49,328 --> 01:16:53,315
But is there any reason
why you shouldn't be perfectly safe here?

812
01:16:53,415 --> 01:16:56,735
If one simple-minded villager
as much as sets foot inside that door...

813
01:16:56,835 --> 01:16:59,655
I'll shoot him like a dog!
You can tell them that for me...

814
01:16:59,755 --> 01:17:02,199
as long as you won't allow me
to tell them myself.

815
01:17:02,299 --> 01:17:04,201
I've never seen him so violent.

816
01:17:04,301 --> 01:17:09,014
Madam, last night I missed my dinner,
and this morning I've had no breakfast.

817
01:17:09,556 --> 01:17:10,833
Now, do you think...

818
01:17:10,933 --> 01:17:14,228
Certainly. I'll order some
at once. If you'll...

819
01:17:22,277 --> 01:17:25,614
Herr Baron,
shall we go into the library?

820
01:17:26,698 --> 01:17:29,201
I prefer to remain here, thank you.

821
01:17:30,077 --> 01:17:32,329
Shall we go into the library?

822
01:17:37,209 --> 01:17:41,739
I don't mind telling you, Inspector,
that as a guest in my own house...

823
01:17:41,839 --> 01:17:44,466
you'll find me extremely disagreeable.

824
01:17:55,102 --> 01:17:58,339
Sailing, sailing, over the bounding main

825
01:17:58,439 --> 01:18:00,924
- May I come in?
- Come in, Inspector, please.

826
01:18:01,024 --> 01:18:03,152
Thank you. Hello, young man.

827
01:18:03,610 --> 01:18:07,014
- Your mother said I could visit you.
- Hello, General.

828
01:18:07,114 --> 01:18:09,933
I'll be back in a moment, darling.
Excuse me, please.

829
01:18:10,033 --> 01:18:12,786
You see, I have no young son of my own.

830
01:18:14,788 --> 01:18:16,915
Oh, that's too bad.

831
01:18:17,499 --> 01:18:20,444
- Have you done any more hunting lately?
- Yes.

832
01:18:20,544 --> 01:18:23,464
- Has the giant paid you any more visits?
- Yes.

833
01:18:25,507 --> 01:18:28,302
- He's a great big fellow, I imagine.
- Yes.

834
01:18:28,594 --> 01:18:31,930
So big, possibly,
he can hardly get through that door?

835
01:18:32,306 --> 01:18:34,917
No, he doesn't come through the door.

836
01:18:35,017 --> 01:18:38,796
No? Where does he come in?
Through the window? The fireplace?

837
01:18:38,896 --> 01:18:41,440
- Through the wall.
- Through the wall?

838
01:18:42,274 --> 01:18:44,067
- Where?
- Over there.

839
01:18:47,446 --> 01:18:49,448
That's very interesting.

840
01:18:51,617 --> 01:18:53,936
You're not afraid of him at all,
are you, Peter?

841
01:18:54,036 --> 01:18:57,022
No, he's a nice giant.
He gave me a watch.

842
01:18:57,122 --> 01:18:58,832
- A watch?
- Yes.

843
01:18:59,166 --> 01:19:01,794
- Would you like to see it?
- Very much.

844
01:19:08,717 --> 01:19:10,052
Thank you.

845
01:19:11,678 --> 01:19:14,598
Yes, it's a very nice watch. A very...

846
01:19:18,602 --> 01:19:20,020
nice watch.

847
01:19:23,607 --> 01:19:27,986
Peter, shall we go downstairs
and have some nice hot chocolate?

848
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:29,571
Yes.

849
01:19:29,822 --> 01:19:33,350
- If the General will come with me.
- I'll be very pleased, sir.

850
01:19:33,450 --> 01:19:34,868
Here we go.

851
01:19:42,126 --> 01:19:44,837
- Hurry up.
- All right, I'm coming.

852
01:19:45,337 --> 01:19:47,364
Superstitious, blundering idiot!

853
01:19:47,464 --> 01:19:50,743
Prying, insinuating, accusing.
I'll kick him out of the house!

854
01:19:50,843 --> 01:19:54,455
I'll not be heckled by a stupid,
intolerable policeman.

855
01:19:54,555 --> 01:19:56,665
Wolf, the way you're carrying on...

856
01:19:56,765 --> 01:19:59,643
if I were a policeman,
I'd be suspicious myself.

857
01:20:00,227 --> 01:20:02,004
- You would?
- Yes, I would.

858
01:20:02,104 --> 01:20:05,691
Mysterious things have happened.
A murder in the village.

859
01:20:05,899 --> 01:20:08,635
Our own dear Benson
disappears for no reason.

860
01:20:08,735 --> 01:20:13,449
They probably think you, like your father,
have created another monster or...

861
01:20:16,285 --> 01:20:19,229
He's got even you, my own wife,
believing that I...

862
01:20:19,329 --> 01:20:22,149
I believe nothing.
I don't care about Krogh.

863
01:20:22,249 --> 01:20:25,043
But I'm afraid for you, for Peter.

864
01:20:25,419 --> 01:20:27,780
And only you, Wolf,
can restore my confidence.

865
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:31,633
Please, darling, Elsa,
please have faith in me!

866
01:20:31,758 --> 01:20:34,178
I'm sorry that I lost control of myself.

867
01:20:34,887 --> 01:20:39,224
I've no reason for being nervous like this.
But I've been working too hard.

868
01:20:39,767 --> 01:20:43,712
A terrific experiment,
one that I wanted to surprise you with...

869
01:20:43,812 --> 01:20:47,216
one that would establish me
and my work. My work...

870
01:20:47,316 --> 01:20:49,802
as something outstanding
in the world of science.

871
01:20:49,902 --> 01:20:52,846
But believe me, darling,
there's nothing to be afraid of.

872
01:20:52,946 --> 01:20:57,868
I wouldn't be afraid if I hadn't,
for the first time, sensed you were afraid.

873
01:20:58,535 --> 01:21:00,370
Me? Oh, silly.

874
01:21:01,121 --> 01:21:05,167
Everything's under control.
I'll not lose my temper again. You'll see.

875
01:21:14,927 --> 01:21:16,303
Inspector.

876
01:21:29,525 --> 01:21:32,553
Sorry, young man. I shan't be able
to take chocolate with you.

877
01:21:32,653 --> 01:21:35,597
Tell your father and mother
I'll be back very soon.

878
01:21:35,697 --> 01:21:38,909
- Goodbye, General.
- Krantz, remain here on guard.

879
01:21:41,578 --> 01:21:42,938
Now I can go to the lab.

880
01:21:43,038 --> 01:21:45,983
I mean, I must go to the lab.
Only for a minute, dear.

881
01:21:46,083 --> 01:21:48,043
I won't be long, really.

882
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:21,285
No touch him, Frankenstein!

883
01:22:21,702 --> 01:22:23,187
No touch him...

884
01:22:23,287 --> 01:22:26,582
or something happens to you
worse than dying.

885
01:22:26,915 --> 01:22:28,942
- How long has he been here?
- All night.

886
01:22:29,042 --> 01:22:31,195
You liar! He was in the village.

887
01:22:31,295 --> 01:22:34,715
- You made him kill Herr Neumüller.
- Yes, why not?

888
01:22:35,507 --> 01:22:37,259
Neumüller kills me.

889
01:22:37,468 --> 01:22:40,596
Eight men say Ygor hang.

890
01:22:41,221 --> 01:22:44,349
Now eight men dead.

891
01:22:44,933 --> 01:22:47,478
- All dead!
- You crazy fool!

892
01:22:47,728 --> 01:22:51,507
If Krogh finds him, he'll kill him.
Then he won't be any good to either of us.

893
01:22:51,607 --> 01:22:54,843
You get out of here. If I find you
hanging around here again, I'll...

894
01:22:54,943 --> 01:22:57,613
He's mine! He no belong to you!

895
01:22:58,238 --> 01:23:00,683
You go away, not me!

896
01:23:18,717 --> 01:23:20,010
Get back!

897
01:23:21,178 --> 01:23:22,538
Where is everybody?

898
01:23:22,638 --> 01:23:26,208
The Baron's in the library, sir.
The rest of the family are at dinner.

899
01:23:26,308 --> 01:23:28,836
I've had to send to Bandleheim
for additional police.

900
01:23:28,936 --> 01:23:32,047
Krantz, you report to Sgt. Schiller
at the lower gate.

901
01:23:32,147 --> 01:23:35,400
- The crowd is becoming unmanageable.
- Herr Inspector.

902
01:23:41,115 --> 01:23:42,366
Come in.

903
01:23:43,575 --> 01:23:46,520
Good evening, Inspector.
I thought that I'd see you sooner.

904
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:49,790
Sorry. I've been busy.
Very busy indeed, for me.

905
01:23:50,415 --> 01:23:52,818
My job is usually a rather sleepy one.

906
01:23:52,918 --> 01:23:55,070
- Have a drink?
- Thank you, no.

907
01:23:55,170 --> 01:23:58,715
I'm afraid I shall require
all the wits I've got tonight.

908
01:24:00,134 --> 01:24:03,220
I've never seen you
disturbed before, Inspector.

909
01:24:03,595 --> 01:24:08,016
- You've even forgotten to take off your hat.
- Not forgotten, Herr Baron.

910
01:24:08,434 --> 01:24:10,436
Merely a matter of form.

911
01:24:11,186 --> 01:24:14,148
My business tonight
is official, not social.

912
01:24:14,565 --> 01:24:16,984
Rather a crude custom, I agree...

913
01:24:18,110 --> 01:24:19,653
but a custom.

914
01:24:20,737 --> 01:24:23,282
Well, sir, what news from the front?

915
01:24:25,492 --> 01:24:28,454
Another death. Another inquest.

916
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,316
When did it occur? This afternoon?

917
01:24:32,416 --> 01:24:34,418
No. Sometime last night.

918
01:24:35,377 --> 01:24:38,197
It was only discovered
late this morning.

919
01:24:38,297 --> 01:24:40,090
Herr Lang, this time.

920
01:24:40,757 --> 01:24:42,676
The village apothecary.

921
01:24:43,010 --> 01:24:45,095
A very old and dear friend.

922
01:24:46,305 --> 01:24:47,973
He'll be mourned.

923
01:24:49,725 --> 01:24:52,227
- Too bad.
- Yes, isn't it?

924
01:24:53,103 --> 01:24:56,340
Herr Lang? Never heard
of him before. Oh, well.

925
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:59,301
I suppose the villagers will say
I killed him, just the same.

926
01:24:59,401 --> 01:25:03,071
No, not that you killed him,
but that you know who did.

927
01:25:06,033 --> 01:25:08,994
Really? But of course I know who did.

928
01:25:09,161 --> 01:25:11,455
Haven't you heard? The Monster!

929
01:25:12,456 --> 01:25:14,900
Yes, that's what they think.

930
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,404
Is it the old legendary monster
of my father's time...

931
01:25:18,504 --> 01:25:21,323
or am I supposed
to have whipped one up...

932
01:25:21,423 --> 01:25:24,051
as a housewife whips up an omelette?

933
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:27,429
I've been here over a month, you know.

934
01:25:28,055 --> 01:25:30,207
Your wife and child are in danger.

935
01:25:30,307 --> 01:25:31,834
So? From what?

936
01:25:31,934 --> 01:25:35,462
- You tried to send them away.
- I will tomorrow, in spite of you.

937
01:25:35,562 --> 01:25:38,065
You forget I have my hat on.

938
01:25:39,483 --> 01:25:41,735
Meaning that I'm under arrest?

939
01:25:42,694 --> 01:25:43,779
Yes.

940
01:25:45,155 --> 01:25:49,660
I promised your arrest to the villagers
to keep them quiet for the moment.

941
01:25:50,369 --> 01:25:52,479
For the murder of Lang and Neumüller?

942
01:25:52,579 --> 01:25:55,165
No. For the murder of Benson.

943
01:25:56,041 --> 01:25:59,086
A technical charge, for the time being.

944
01:26:00,963 --> 01:26:04,158
Why don't you search the laboratory?
You have my permission.

945
01:26:04,258 --> 01:26:07,594
I've searched it already
without your permission...

946
01:26:07,886 --> 01:26:10,097
with two men the other night.

947
01:26:10,222 --> 01:26:14,476
We found nothing incriminating
but a very large table...

948
01:26:15,894 --> 01:26:17,479
fit for a giant.

949
01:26:19,356 --> 01:26:21,050
Yes, it was my father's.

950
01:26:21,150 --> 01:26:23,652
I reconstructed it out of curiosity.

951
01:26:23,819 --> 01:26:26,071
Why don't you search it again?

952
01:26:29,575 --> 01:26:31,034
By George...

953
01:26:32,161 --> 01:26:34,229
I think I know who your monster may be.

954
01:26:34,329 --> 01:26:36,373
Good. Who?

955
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,733
Old Ygor.

956
01:26:39,918 --> 01:26:41,670
Of course. Why not?

957
01:26:42,504 --> 01:26:45,282
Everybody wants
to hang old Ygor again...

958
01:26:45,382 --> 01:26:47,468
yet he has a perfect alibi.

959
01:26:47,718 --> 01:26:51,830
He was constantly under observation
when every murder was committed.

960
01:26:51,930 --> 01:26:55,934
It's curious that the entire jury
that hanged him is dead.

961
01:26:57,019 --> 01:27:00,147
But he was never seen
at the scene of the crime.

962
01:27:00,564 --> 01:27:04,026
Yet it would be too simple
to hang old Ygor.

963
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:06,553
I don't trust him!

964
01:27:06,653 --> 01:27:09,531
I'm gonna find him
and kick him off the estate...

965
01:27:11,784 --> 01:27:13,577
with your permission.

966
01:27:15,913 --> 01:27:17,039
Yes.

967
01:27:17,998 --> 01:27:19,374
If you like.

968
01:30:41,326 --> 01:30:45,022
Amelia, you can put Peter to bed
at once, but stay with him.

969
01:30:45,122 --> 01:30:46,540
Yes, madam.

970
01:30:51,378 --> 01:30:54,823
Inspector, I'm more terrified
every minute.

971
01:30:54,923 --> 01:30:59,203
Madam, I personally guarantee to get you
and your son out of here in the morning.

972
01:30:59,303 --> 01:31:03,040
And Wolf. He's a bundle
of uncontrollable nerves and...

973
01:31:03,140 --> 01:31:07,060
Yes. I'm going in now to comfort him.

974
01:31:07,811 --> 01:31:09,146
Thank you.

975
01:31:15,886 --> 01:31:17,179
Come in.

976
01:31:19,056 --> 01:31:22,167
- Did you find Ygor?
- Yes, I got rid of him. Have a drink?

977
01:31:22,267 --> 01:31:24,044
How did you get rid of him?

978
01:31:24,144 --> 01:31:27,381
I killed him! He tried to murder me
with his hammer, so I shot him.

979
01:31:27,481 --> 01:31:30,217
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Compliment you.

980
01:31:30,317 --> 01:31:33,278
For it is he who undoubtedly
killed Benson.

981
01:31:35,572 --> 01:31:37,699
He's dead. Murdered.

982
01:31:38,450 --> 01:31:42,187
I just found his body
in a secret passageway off the nursery.

983
01:31:42,287 --> 01:31:43,956
Here's his watch.

984
01:31:44,373 --> 01:31:46,942
It was in the possession of your son.

985
01:31:47,042 --> 01:31:50,921
And here's a bit of chain
that was attached to Benson's vest.

986
01:31:51,888 --> 01:31:54,332
But Ygor didn't do it, nor did you.

987
01:31:54,508 --> 01:31:58,662
Nor was it done by any ghost.
There's a monster afoot and you know it.

988
01:31:58,762 --> 01:32:00,497
He's in your control.

989
01:32:00,597 --> 01:32:03,750
By heaven, I think you're a worse fiend
than your father.

990
01:32:03,850 --> 01:32:05,878
Where is this monster? Where is he?

991
01:32:05,978 --> 01:32:08,589
I'll stay by your side
until you confess.

992
01:32:08,689 --> 01:32:11,800
And if you don't,
I'll feed you to the villagers...

993
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:14,861
like the Romans fed Christians
to the lions.

994
01:32:16,363 --> 01:32:18,473
I wouldn't put it past you.

995
01:32:18,573 --> 01:32:21,143
In the meantime, will you have a drink?

996
01:32:21,243 --> 01:32:23,620
Or would you like to play darts?

997
01:35:50,994 --> 01:35:52,037
Amelia!

998
01:35:54,998 --> 01:35:57,542
Where is Peter, Amelia? Where is he?

999
01:35:59,127 --> 01:36:00,504
He's gone!

1000
01:36:01,421 --> 01:36:03,257
Peter!

1001
01:36:05,259 --> 01:36:07,427
- What is it?
- Peter's gone!

1002
01:36:07,761 --> 01:36:09,930
I'm going to the laboratory!

1003
01:36:50,387 --> 01:36:51,763
Here we are.

1004
01:36:54,433 --> 01:36:55,809
Peter!

1005
01:37:07,112 --> 01:37:08,905
Open the door!

1006
01:37:28,508 --> 01:37:30,010
Daddy!

1007
01:37:59,039 --> 01:38:00,332
Oh, baby.

1008
01:38:04,670 --> 01:38:08,407
Herewith I deed to you the castle
and the estates of Frankenstein.

1009
01:38:08,507 --> 01:38:10,075
Do with them what you will.

1010
01:38:10,175 --> 01:38:14,429
And may happiness and peace of mind
be restored to you all.

1011
01:38:15,222 --> 01:38:16,556
Goodbye.

1012
01:38:32,447 --> 01:38:34,516
- Goodbye, gentlemen.
- Goodbye, Baron.

1013
01:38:34,616 --> 01:38:36,827
- Goodbye, Peter.
- Goodbye, General.
