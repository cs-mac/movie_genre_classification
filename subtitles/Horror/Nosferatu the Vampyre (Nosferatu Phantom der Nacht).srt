Here is its story:</i>

29
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,500
<i>There once lived in Wisborg
Hutter and his young wife Ellen...</i>

30
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:31,375
“Why have you killed them...
the beautiful flowers...?!”

31
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:57,750
“Not so hasty, young friend!
No one outruns their fate.”

32
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:13,550
<i>There was also a property broker, Knock,
about whom all sorts of rumors went around.</i>

33
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:17,475
<i>One thing for certain,
he paid his people well...</i>

34
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:24,985
“Count Orlok – His Grace...
from Transylvania...”

35
00:08:25,085 --> 00:08:30,375
“wishes to purchase a lovely house...
in our little town...”

36
00:08:32,575 --> 00:08:38,350
“You could earn a tidy sum...”

37
00:08:41,725 --> 00:08:45,800
“...though it shall cost some effort...”

38
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,975
“a bit of sweat and perhaps...”

39
00:08:50,075 --> 00:08:54,150
“a little blood...”

40
00:09:42,025 --> 00:09:45,900
“He wants a right fine,
deserted house...”

41
00:09:58,175 --> 00:10:04,475
“That house... just across from yours.
Offer him that one!”

42
00:10:06,825 --> 00:10:15,775
“Travel quickly, travel well, young friend,
into the land of spectres.”

43
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:41,725
“I travel far, far away into the
land of thieves and spectres.”

44
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:23,945
<i>Thus did Hutter give his distraught
wife over to the care of his friends,</i>

45
00:12:24,045 --> 00:12:33,790
<i>the wealthy shipowner
Harding and his sister...</i>

“Do not be concerned.”

47
