1
00:01:48,306 --> 00:01:50,511
Now, on the day I was born

2
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,849
The nurses all gathered round

3
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:54,957
And they gazed in wild wonder

4
00:01:55,028 --> 00:01:57,485
At the joy they had found

5
00:01:57,557 --> 00:01:59,662
The head nurse spoke up

6
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:01,971
Said leave this one alone

7
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:04,275
She could tell right away

8
00:02:04,343 --> 00:02:06,799
That I was bad to the bone

9
00:02:06,872 --> 00:02:08,978
Bad to the bone

10
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:13,679
B-B-B-B-B-Bad

11
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:20,725
Bad to the bone

12
00:02:20,796 --> 00:02:23,098
I broke 1,000 hearts

13
00:02:23,165 --> 00:02:25,075
Before I met you

14
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,255
I'll break 1,000 more, baby

15
00:02:27,326 --> 00:02:29,848
Before I am through

16
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,059
I want to be yours, pretty baby

17
00:02:32,128 --> 00:02:34,268
Yours, and yours alone

18
00:02:34,337 --> 00:02:36,639
I'm here to tell you, honey

19
00:02:36,706 --> 00:02:39,161
That I'm bad to the bone

20
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:41,471
Bad to the bone

21
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:43,394
B-B-B-B-B-Bad

22
00:02:48,613 --> 00:02:50,469
Bad to the bone

23
00:03:35,285 --> 00:03:37,707
I'm a-gonna tell you
how it's gonna be

24
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:42,321
You gonna give
your love to me

25
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:33,603
My love is bigger
than the Cadillac

26
00:04:35,528 --> 00:04:38,180
After I show you I'll be back

27
00:04:40,457 --> 00:04:42,759
Your love for me
has got to be real

28
00:04:44,042 --> 00:04:44,936
Holy shit!

29
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,565
Come on, Arnie.

30
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:26,582
He's coming.
He's changing his shirt.

31
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:29,903
That's noise pollution,
what you're doing.

32
00:05:33,274 --> 00:05:36,756
You might as well be dumping
toxic waste on our lawn.

33
00:05:36,828 --> 00:05:39,795
Hey, Dennis.
I'll be right there.

34
00:05:39,868 --> 00:05:42,105
Just leave it.
It's okay.

35
00:05:42,172 --> 00:05:44,180
Go on. It's okay.

36
00:05:44,253 --> 00:05:46,109
Arnie, your lunch!

37
00:05:48,735 --> 00:05:50,590
Try and keep it cold.
There's yogurt in there.

38
00:05:50,655 --> 00:05:51,638
Right.

39
00:06:00,706 --> 00:06:02,365
Slow down!

40
00:06:08,773 --> 00:06:10,432
Are you guys having a war?

41
00:06:10,501 --> 00:06:14,300
She's pissed otf
'cause I'm taking shop. My dad too.

42
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,955
It won't embarrass them when you
fix their stupid Volvo for free.

43
00:06:18,025 --> 00:06:19,880
- What?
- Last night, we're playing Scrabble.

44
00:06:19,945 --> 00:06:22,663
It's neck-and-neck between me and her.
We blew my dad away early.

45
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:26,987
So, at the end, I had this choice
of "ratio" for five lousy points...

46
00:06:27,051 --> 00:06:29,091
- or...
- Or what, Arnie?

47
00:06:29,163 --> 00:06:32,263
"tellatio" for 24 points
and the game.

48
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:35,051
- What'd she do?
- She won by seven points...

49
00:06:35,117 --> 00:06:37,191
because obscenity's not allowed
in Scrabble.

50
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:42,020
- And it's in the dictionary!
- You jerk, Arnie. Jesus.

51
00:06:45,457 --> 00:06:48,175
You know, Arnie,
I was thinking...

52
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:50,152
Uh-oh.

53
00:06:50,227 --> 00:06:52,115
No, seriously.

54
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:55,792
Now that we're gonna be seniors,
I figure it's about time...

55
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,388
that we got you laid.

56
00:06:57,461 --> 00:07:01,422
- You know, like this year, huh?
- You need a girl to get laid.

57
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:06,701
- What about Gail Justin?
- I don't like her mustache.

58
00:07:06,775 --> 00:07:10,454
Fuck you! What do you care
if you get a little hair in your mouth?

59
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,408
Okay. How about Sally Hayes?
She's cute.

60
00:07:16,475 --> 00:07:19,291
- She's a sophomore!
- So what? She's a walking sperm bank.

61
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,210
I know. Come on.

62
00:07:21,276 --> 00:07:24,375
I don't have the minimum deposit
to open an account.

63
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:28,472
Are you kidding? You carry
your lite savings between your legs.

64
00:07:29,663 --> 00:07:31,703
Come on, Arnie.

65
00:07:31,775 --> 00:07:33,631
I think maybe
I'll just beat off.

66
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:43,420
Are you playing
football this year or what?

67
00:07:43,491 --> 00:07:45,434
Somebody's got to pick it up
when you fumble.

68
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:47,745
- Hey, Terry.
- How's your gimpy knee?

69
00:07:47,812 --> 00:07:49,886
It's better.
Coach wants me to practice.

70
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:53,756
Yeah? It's about time. I've been eatin'
dirt with your name on it for weeks.

71
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,022
Hi, Dennis.

72
00:07:59,016 --> 00:08:01,634
Oh, hey, Roseanne.
How you doing?

73
00:08:01,704 --> 00:08:05,896
I'm okay. They gonna
let you play tootball?

74
00:08:05,962 --> 00:08:07,043
Yeah.

75
00:08:07,114 --> 00:08:09,003
Doc says I'm as good as new.

76
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:12,578
Then I guess
I'll be seeing you out there.

77
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:16,201
I hope so.

78
00:08:17,007 --> 00:08:18,862
Well, T.T.F.N.

79
00:08:19,728 --> 00:08:21,997
Yeah. Ta-ta for now.

80
00:08:27,762 --> 00:08:29,617
I wouldn't put that in my mouth.

81
00:08:29,682 --> 00:08:31,538
- You don't know where it's been.
- Get outta here.

82
00:08:31,603 --> 00:08:34,768
But we know where it hasn't been.
With you.

83
00:08:34,836 --> 00:08:37,325
- Having trouble with your locker?
- No.

84
00:08:37,397 --> 00:08:40,180
- Did you see the new girl?
- I just got here!

85
00:08:40,246 --> 00:08:45,069
- I'm in love, and I'm fussy.
- I never noticed you were fussy.

86
00:08:45,143 --> 00:08:46,670
Drop dead, Cunningham.

87
00:08:46,743 --> 00:08:48,915
- What's her name?
- I don't know. She's in the office.

88
00:08:48,984 --> 00:08:52,815
She looks smart,
but she's got a slut's body.

89
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,978
Oh, shit. Here she comes.

90
00:08:57,051 --> 00:08:59,419
I think you'll like it here, Leigh.

91
00:08:59,484 --> 00:09:01,556
Give me something
for my lap.

92
00:09:01,628 --> 00:09:06,551
We have a good band. Went to the Rose
Parade. Not a bad way to meet boys.

93
00:09:06,622 --> 00:09:08,510
I would like to get involved
with the yearbook.

94
00:09:08,574 --> 00:09:12,350
We have a territic yearbook staff.
Won a prize last year.

95
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:16,825
So, what about admitting
Red China into the U. N.?

96
00:09:16,898 --> 00:09:19,200
- I think we already did that.
- Yeah, but...

97
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,136
do you think it was a good idea?

98
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:25,055
She smiled at me.

99
00:09:25,124 --> 00:09:28,223
I want to have deep,
meaningful sex with her.

100
00:09:28,293 --> 00:09:31,141
- Go get her, Bemis.
- Think I should?

101
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:33,890
You've got nothing
to lose but your virginity.

102
00:09:36,456 --> 00:09:39,140
Dennis, can you give me a hand?

103
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:41,991
- I can't...
- Yeah.

104
00:09:42,057 --> 00:09:44,676
- He doesn't have a chance.
- I don't think so either.

105
00:09:44,746 --> 00:09:47,944
She's much too classy for him.

106
00:09:48,011 --> 00:09:50,248
- There you go.
- What did you do?

107
00:09:50,315 --> 00:09:52,455
Lucky. See you at lunch.

108
00:10:06,129 --> 00:10:07,985
Hey, Charley.
Have you seen Arnie?

109
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,920
- Yeah. He's still in the shop.
- What's the matter?

110
00:10:10,994 --> 00:10:13,329
Buddy Repperton has his lunch.

111
00:10:13,396 --> 00:10:15,251
- Buddy Repperton.
- Hi, Dennis...

112
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:21,173
Come on, pizza face.

113
00:10:25,271 --> 00:10:28,371
You want it?
Come get it!

114
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,605
If it's yours,
why isn't your name on here anywhere?

115
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,200
"Arnie Cuntingham."

116
00:10:34,362 --> 00:10:37,233
Why doesn't it say Cuntingham?

117
00:10:37,307 --> 00:10:38,966
Just take it, and let's go eat.

118
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,916
That's all you got to do.
Come on.

119
00:10:55,649 --> 00:10:57,952
That's funny, Buddy,
real funny.

120
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,767
Go get Mr. Casey.

121
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:18,465
Come on.
You want to go for it?

122
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:21,288
Put the knife down.

123
00:11:21,353 --> 00:11:24,037
- Put down the knife.
- You want to make me?

124
00:11:25,514 --> 00:11:28,549
You've got a knife and he doesn't.
That makes you a chicken shit.

125
00:11:28,619 --> 00:11:31,369
- Yeah. That's chicken shit.
- Yeah?

126
00:11:31,436 --> 00:11:34,055
- Put it down.
- Yeah, put down the knite.

127
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,980
Put down the knife, okay?

128
00:11:50,194 --> 00:11:52,050
Get him, man!

129
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:15,286
How do you like that, dickface?

130
00:12:17,435 --> 00:12:20,120
All right, break it up!
Right now.

131
00:12:20,188 --> 00:12:22,676
You kids take a walk.
Get lost.

132
00:12:22,748 --> 00:12:24,177
Not you, Moochie.

133
00:12:24,253 --> 00:12:27,221
- I ain't been doing nothing.
- You all right, Dennis?

134
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,038
Yeah, I'm okay.

135
00:12:33,728 --> 00:12:36,150
Real cute.
Three on one.

136
00:12:38,978 --> 00:12:40,888
They started it.

137
00:12:40,963 --> 00:12:43,351
- That's not true.
- Shut up, cuntface!

138
00:12:43,426 --> 00:12:44,921
Shut your mouth!

139
00:12:44,995 --> 00:12:48,160
I don't have to listen
to garbage like that, Buddy!

140
00:12:51,461 --> 00:12:53,851
What were you saying?

141
00:12:53,927 --> 00:12:55,389
Repperton's got a knife.

142
00:12:55,463 --> 00:12:57,056
You fucking liar!

143
00:12:58,088 --> 00:13:00,292
It's a switchblade.

144
00:13:00,361 --> 00:13:03,939
That's bullshit, Mr. Casey.
He's lying. I swear to God.

145
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,190
Did Repperton here
pull a knife on you?

146
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,824
Yeah.

147
00:13:18,895 --> 00:13:21,001
Empty your pockets, Buddy.

148
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,829
Fuck I will.
You can't make me.

149
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:29,069
If you mean I don't have the authority,
you're wrong.

150
00:13:29,137 --> 00:13:32,138
Try it, you bald fuck, and I'll
knock you through the wall! Fuck!

151
00:13:38,997 --> 00:13:41,234
You two boys go up to the office.
Stay there.

152
00:13:41,302 --> 00:13:43,538
Don't go anywhere.
You've got enough trouble.

153
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,484
Now...

154
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:50,807
if you don't empty your pockets
right now, I'm gonna call the cops.

155
00:14:02,397 --> 00:14:03,825
Go to the office, Buddy.

156
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,646
I'll fix you!

157
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:16,184
You're gonna wish you were
never fucking born!

158
00:14:28,037 --> 00:14:31,900
So, all in all,
it wasn't a bad first day.

159
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,254
Think Repperton
will try to get even?

160
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,393
No, he's a douche bag.

161
00:14:39,464 --> 00:14:41,985
He'll tind somebody
else to pick on.

162
00:14:42,057 --> 00:14:44,959
- They kicked him out, you know.
- Good.

163
00:14:45,033 --> 00:14:47,106
They kick Moochie out?

164
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,219
Probation.

165
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,146
Those assholes.

166
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:55,369
Stop the car! Quick!
Go back!

167
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:57,380
- What's the matter?
- I want to look at her!

168
00:14:57,454 --> 00:14:59,528
- All right, Arnie.
- Just go back. All right?

169
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:01,454
Jesus Christ.

170
00:15:08,561 --> 00:15:10,417
What is it?

171
00:15:12,051 --> 00:15:14,124
Do you know someone who lives here?

172
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,124
What?

173
00:15:30,584 --> 00:15:31,959
Jesus.

174
00:15:46,557 --> 00:15:48,413
Be careful, Dennis.

175
00:15:50,303 --> 00:15:54,461
- This is a piece of shit.
- She could be fixed up.

176
00:15:54,528 --> 00:15:57,311
- Yeah.
- Oh, she could be really tough.

177
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:06,008
Forget it. This baby's got
93,000 miles on it.

178
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,148
Probably 193.

179
00:16:09,221 --> 00:16:11,109
I don't care.

180
00:16:11,173 --> 00:16:14,436
- I bet it won't even start.
- She'll start.

181
00:16:14,502 --> 00:16:17,318
You need these.

182
00:16:23,592 --> 00:16:25,666
How much do you want for her?

183
00:16:25,738 --> 00:16:28,968
- Whatever it is, it's not enough.
- Jesus, Arnie.

184
00:16:37,518 --> 00:16:40,334
Sonny, you ever owned a car before?

185
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,961
- Yeah, he owns a Mustang...
- No. I just got my license.

186
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:49,384
Name's George LeBay.

187
00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:53,327
Arnie Cunningham.
What are you asking?

188
00:16:54,323 --> 00:16:55,698
Start her up.

189
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,995
Really?

190
00:17:06,071 --> 00:17:07,926
Her name's Christine.

191
00:17:10,264 --> 00:17:12,120
I like that.

192
00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:14,708
Come on. We gotta get going.

193
00:17:14,778 --> 00:17:17,813
My asshole brother
bought her in September, '57.

194
00:17:17,883 --> 00:17:21,048
You got your new model year
in September.

195
00:17:21,116 --> 00:17:23,538
Brand-new, she was.

196
00:17:23,613 --> 00:17:26,363
She had the smell
of a brand-new car.

197
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:30,620
About the finest smell in the world,
except maybe for pussy.

198
00:17:32,831 --> 00:17:35,320
When he got her,
she had six miles on the odometer.

199
00:17:36,705 --> 00:17:39,455
Goddamn Roland went through hell
and back with Christine.

200
00:17:40,194 --> 00:17:43,708
If your brother loves this car so much,
why is he selling it?

201
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,026
'Cause he's stone cold dead.

202
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,588
Died six weeks ago.

203
00:17:50,661 --> 00:17:53,794
So, Mr. LeBay...

204
00:17:53,862 --> 00:17:55,423
how much do you want for her?

205
00:17:55,495 --> 00:17:58,114
I've been asking 300.

206
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,124
I'll make it 250 tor you.

207
00:18:01,192 --> 00:18:04,608
250? This isn't worth 50 bucks.

208
00:18:04,681 --> 00:18:07,781
The money's not important,
and there'll be no bringing her back...

209
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,152
'cause I'm selling this shit hole
and buying me a condo.

210
00:18:10,219 --> 00:18:12,130
You got a deal.

211
00:18:12,203 --> 00:18:14,539
I'll get the pink slip.

212
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:21,539
Will you stop and think about this
tor a moment?

213
00:18:21,615 --> 00:18:23,885
- Where are you getting the money?
- I've been saving all summer.

214
00:18:23,952 --> 00:18:26,920
- For college.
- You already have a car.

215
00:18:26,992 --> 00:18:28,749
He's screwing you.

216
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:31,087
You could get a decent car
for that much money.

217
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:33,740
Christine is decent.

218
00:18:33,811 --> 00:18:35,721
The guy's weird, Arnie.

219
00:18:35,796 --> 00:18:37,771
He's fucking weird.

220
00:18:37,844 --> 00:18:41,358
- So that was 300?
- Yeah, that's it.

221
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:44,213
- You said 250.
- 250 would do it.

222
00:18:44,278 --> 00:18:48,273
It this is a good idea,
let's just come back tomorrow.

223
00:18:48,343 --> 00:18:50,002
Do you realize
she's 20 years old?

224
00:18:50,072 --> 00:18:53,488
I mean, that makes her
officially an antique.

225
00:18:53,561 --> 00:18:57,840
Great. Darnell's junkyard
is full of official antiques.

226
00:18:57,915 --> 00:19:00,982
I'm buying her.
I don't care what you say.

227
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:02,940
It's your funeral, man.

228
00:19:09,213 --> 00:19:12,510
Would you give
Arnie a break?

229
00:19:12,575 --> 00:19:14,485
He doesn't know what he's doing.

230
00:19:15,328 --> 00:19:18,329
You don't know half as much
as you think you do...

231
00:19:18,401 --> 00:19:20,093
shitter.

232
00:19:22,658 --> 00:19:24,415
You did what?

233
00:19:24,483 --> 00:19:28,029
- She's outside.
- You're kidding, right?

234
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,647
You can't buy a car.
What are you talking about?

235
00:19:31,717 --> 00:19:35,034
- You're 17 years old.
- Oh, boy.

236
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,802
Actually, you're wrong.

237
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:40,669
I couldn't finance it,
but buying it for cash is no problem.

238
00:19:40,745 --> 00:19:43,942
Registering a car at 17
is something else...

239
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,246
and for that
I need your permission.

240
00:19:46,313 --> 00:19:48,453
You know how we do things.

241
00:19:49,323 --> 00:19:51,079
You could've consulted with us.

242
00:19:52,523 --> 00:19:55,972
I've consulted with you
about every damn thing I've ever done.

243
00:19:56,045 --> 00:19:59,876
If it's something I want,
I get outvoted, two to one!

244
00:19:59,951 --> 00:20:02,319
This is no committee meeting.
I bought the car, and that's it!

245
00:20:02,383 --> 00:20:06,344
It most certainly
is not it!

246
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:09,646
How could you have
let him do this?

247
00:20:10,673 --> 00:20:13,292
I didn't let him.
He wanted the car, and he bought it.

248
00:20:14,707 --> 00:20:16,847
I tried to talk him out ot it.

249
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:20,300
I doubt you tried very hard.

250
00:20:20,372 --> 00:20:23,986
- Yeah, well, I'm going home.
- I think you should.

251
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:25,909
That's it. I'm getting
the fuck out of here.

252
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:29,358
- What kind of lang...
- What did you say!

253
00:20:32,185 --> 00:20:35,153
You wanted me in college courses.
I'm there.

254
00:20:35,226 --> 00:20:38,074
You wanted chess club instead of band.
I'm there too.

255
00:20:38,139 --> 00:20:42,199
I've managed 17 years without
embarrassing you or landing in jail.

256
00:20:42,268 --> 00:20:45,050
I'm gonna have this one thing!

257
00:20:45,116 --> 00:20:50,071
You are not keeping
any car at this house.

258
00:20:50,141 --> 00:20:51,636
Fine!

259
00:20:58,401 --> 00:20:59,962
Thanks for the milk.

260
00:21:38,734 --> 00:21:42,183
- What's the problem?
- Could you honk your horn for me?

261
00:21:42,255 --> 00:21:44,645
Christine's doesn't
seem to work.

262
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,575
- Ah. Sure.
- Thanks.

263
00:22:18,683 --> 00:22:20,538
Stall 20.

264
00:22:22,812 --> 00:22:24,885
Get it over there
and shut it off...

265
00:22:24,957 --> 00:22:27,161
before we all
choke to death.

266
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,940
Kiddo, if you sold him that piece of
shit, you ought to be fuckin' ashamed.

267
00:22:34,015 --> 00:22:36,918
I didn't sell it to him.
I tried to talk him out of it.

268
00:22:36,992 --> 00:22:39,065
You should have tried harder.

269
00:22:52,485 --> 00:22:55,715
I knew a guy who had
a car like that once.

270
00:22:55,783 --> 00:22:58,533
Fuckin' bastard
killed himself in it.

271
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:00,455
Son of a bitch was so mean...

272
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,593
if you poured boiling water
down his throat...

273
00:23:02,664 --> 00:23:05,764
he would have pissed ice cubes.

274
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:09,446
Okay.
That's the last time...

275
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:12,647
you run that mechanical asshole
in here without an exhaust hose.

276
00:23:12,716 --> 00:23:15,434
I catch you doin' it one time,
and you're out. You understand?

277
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:18,821
- Huh?
- Yes.

278
00:23:18,893 --> 00:23:21,261
I'm gonna tell you
something else right now.

279
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,160
I don't take any shit
trom you kids.

280
00:23:25,232 --> 00:23:29,259
This place is for working stiffs,
gotta keep their cars runnin'.

281
00:23:29,329 --> 00:23:32,592
It's not for rich-assed, snot-nosed kids
draggin' on the Orange Belt.

282
00:23:32,658 --> 00:23:36,620
I don't allow no smoking in here
neither. You go out in the junkyard.

283
00:23:36,691 --> 00:23:40,075
- I don't smoke.
- Don't interrupt me, punk.

284
00:23:40,149 --> 00:23:42,899
Don't interrupt me.
Don't get smart.

285
00:23:44,278 --> 00:23:46,165
- Ah, sir?
- What?

286
00:23:47,606 --> 00:23:51,798
Those men over there are smoking.
Better tell them to stop.

287
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,433
You trying to help your buddy
right out of here, Chuck?

288
00:24:01,692 --> 00:24:04,344
Then shut your pie hole.

289
00:24:04,413 --> 00:24:06,300
I know a creep when I see one.

290
00:24:08,349 --> 00:24:10,936
I think I'm looking
at one right now.

291
00:24:13,087 --> 00:24:16,568
You're on probation.
You get it?

292
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,364
You screw around with me...

293
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:20,408
I don't care how much money
you paid up in front...

294
00:24:20,482 --> 00:24:24,345
I'll throw you out
on your ass! You got it?

295
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:27,234
- Huh?
- Yes, sir.

296
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,860
Good.

297
00:24:32,165 --> 00:24:34,533
Now get the hell out of here.
We're closed.

298
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:53,931
You gonna be okay?

299
00:24:56,365 --> 00:24:58,220
Yeah. I'm okay.

300
00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:07,659
You know, you better find yourself some
other charity besides me and Christine.

301
00:25:10,032 --> 00:25:11,942
What is it about that car?

302
00:25:15,154 --> 00:25:17,010
I don't know.

303
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:22,516
Maybe it's just that for the first time
I've found something uglier than me.

304
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:26,380
And I know I can fix her up.

305
00:25:26,455 --> 00:25:28,310
You're not ugly, Arnie.

306
00:25:30,807 --> 00:25:32,214
I know what I am.

307
00:25:33,848 --> 00:25:35,736
Queer, maybe, but not ugly.

308
00:25:36,985 --> 00:25:38,480
Fuck you.

309
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:48,376
Oh, bug out, Dennis.
You don't need this shit.

310
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:00,091
Where have you been?
You had us worried sick!

311
00:26:00,162 --> 00:26:02,781
You don't just up and drive off
whenever you...

312
00:26:12,421 --> 00:26:18,271
As I walk along I wonder

313
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:22,884
What went wrong with our love

314
00:26:22,953 --> 00:26:25,671
A love that was so strong

315
00:26:39,501 --> 00:26:43,147
He's done all this shit
in three weeks.

316
00:26:43,215 --> 00:26:46,380
Look how cockeyed he works.

317
00:26:46,448 --> 00:26:49,645
He's got tuckin' brand-new
windshield wipers...

318
00:26:49,712 --> 00:26:51,852
for a busted windshield.

319
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,950
Well, the boy does
have good hands.

320
00:26:56,018 --> 00:26:57,393
Good hands.

321
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:00,394
Bad taste in cars.

322
00:27:01,749 --> 00:27:06,453
You know, Papa,
you can't polish a turd.

323
00:27:31,838 --> 00:27:36,379
When I said you could scrounge through
that shit pile out back...

324
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:41,185
I didn't mean you could build
your whole fuckin' car with my stuff.

325
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,567
What do you care?
You're not doing anything with it.

326
00:27:44,642 --> 00:27:48,352
Hey! Don't think you
got the gold key to the crapper.

327
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:50,689
Nobody takes advantage
of me, understand?

328
00:27:52,292 --> 00:27:53,635
Yeah.

329
00:27:53,701 --> 00:27:58,175
If it wasn't for me, it'd cost you
a shit pile to put this heap together.

330
00:27:58,246 --> 00:27:59,621
I know.

331
00:28:04,745 --> 00:28:06,601
Look.

332
00:28:07,945 --> 00:28:12,070
I know you ain't got money
falling out of your asshole.

333
00:28:12,138 --> 00:28:14,474
If you did,
you wouldn't be here.

334
00:28:16,748 --> 00:28:19,913
Maybe we could work out
some kind of a deal.

335
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,789
You...

336
00:28:27,855 --> 00:28:30,190
pick up around the place.

337
00:28:30,257 --> 00:28:32,112
Do a few lubes...

338
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:36,077
put the toilet paper
on the little spools...

339
00:28:36,146 --> 00:28:38,318
shit like that.

340
00:28:38,387 --> 00:28:40,428
Do that and you can...

341
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,942
you can raid my junk pile
for whatever you want.

342
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:48,113
I might even throw in
a few bucks.

343
00:28:50,071 --> 00:28:52,439
I'll have to think about it.

344
00:28:52,504 --> 00:28:56,302
Well, don't think about it too long!
I'll throw you out on your fuckin' ass.

345
00:29:19,777 --> 00:29:24,001
Forever, my darling

346
00:29:24,066 --> 00:29:28,223
My love will be true

347
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:31,107
Always and forever

348
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:35,428
I'll love just you

349
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:39,937
Just promise me, darling

350
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:45,315
Your love in return

351
00:29:45,386 --> 00:29:48,582
May this fire in my soul, dear

352
00:29:50,058 --> 00:29:53,092
Forever burn

353
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:59,851
My heart's at your command, dear

354
00:30:01,102 --> 00:30:03,951
I'll bet you a dollar
she says no.

355
00:30:04,015 --> 00:30:05,871
Just 'cause she shot you down?

356
00:30:05,936 --> 00:30:08,587
She says no to everybody.

357
00:30:16,626 --> 00:30:18,602
Look what she's doing
to that pencil.

358
00:30:18,676 --> 00:30:21,295
I wish I was an eraser.

359
00:30:24,438 --> 00:30:26,806
Go on, studley.
Ask her out.

360
00:30:26,871 --> 00:30:29,140
Mind your own business.
Just read the book.

361
00:30:29,206 --> 00:30:32,917
Yeah. Come on.
Just don't tip the table over.

362
00:31:30,442 --> 00:31:32,297
What are you reading?

363
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:36,195
- History.
- Oh.

364
00:31:36,268 --> 00:31:40,231
- It's pretty boring, huh?
- Yeah.

365
00:31:40,302 --> 00:31:41,993
Listen, do you like music?

366
00:31:45,231 --> 00:31:47,818
What about dancing?

367
00:31:47,889 --> 00:31:49,481
Yes.

368
00:31:50,256 --> 00:31:52,941
Do you think you might...

369
00:31:53,009 --> 00:31:55,311
want to go dancing with me...

370
00:31:55,379 --> 00:31:58,641
like maybe this Friday night
after the game?

371
00:31:59,316 --> 00:32:01,259
I'm sorry. I can't.

372
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,004
Why not?

373
00:32:16,569 --> 00:32:17,943
I have a date.

374
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:21,623
Mr. Gilder! Are you lost?

375
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,010
No, ma'am.

376
00:32:25,084 --> 00:32:27,900
Why don't you return to your own seat
and get back to work.

377
00:32:29,661 --> 00:32:30,555
Yeah.

378
00:32:52,708 --> 00:32:55,392
Arnie, stay here
so we can talk this over.

379
00:32:55,461 --> 00:32:58,910
Mister, this is not a hotel
you can just drop into.

380
00:32:58,982 --> 00:33:00,893
- I don't need this.
- What do you need?

381
00:33:00,967 --> 00:33:04,995
- I need to leave. I'm late.
- You come back here this instant.

382
00:33:07,561 --> 00:33:09,220
Oh, shit.

383
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:11,657
Greetings to you too.

384
00:33:14,091 --> 00:33:17,256
Hey, man, no glasses.
You're lookin' good.

385
00:33:17,324 --> 00:33:20,260
I can't make it.
I meant to call you, but I forgot.

386
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:25,446
Is Dennis going with you?

387
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,903
- Are you going with him?
- Am I?

388
00:33:28,977 --> 00:33:31,879
No. I've gotta do an errand
for Darnell.

389
00:33:31,953 --> 00:33:34,987
- You need a ride?
- Got his car. Thanks, though.

390
00:33:35,058 --> 00:33:37,644
I'm sorry about the movie,
but this is work. Gotta go.

391
00:33:39,188 --> 00:33:42,571
- Don't worry about it.
- Did you have plans with Dennis?

392
00:33:43,861 --> 00:33:48,980
You are going to have no friends at all
if you keep treating people this way.

393
00:33:49,047 --> 00:33:50,454
Get off my back!

394
00:33:54,328 --> 00:33:57,144
You're his best friend.
What's going on?

395
00:34:01,434 --> 00:34:04,305
I don't know.
I hardly see him anymore.

396
00:34:06,236 --> 00:34:08,091
Neither do we.

397
00:34:10,109 --> 00:34:14,420
Ever since he bought that car
he's been obsessed with it.

398
00:34:14,494 --> 00:34:16,950
And you know what else?

399
00:34:17,023 --> 00:34:19,261
When we signed the registration papers
at Town Hall...

400
00:34:20,961 --> 00:34:24,956
they told us the man
who owned that car last...

401
00:34:25,027 --> 00:34:28,061
died in it
of carbon monoxide poisoning.

402
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:34,435
Jesus.
Does Arnie know about that?

403
00:34:36,165 --> 00:34:39,745
Arnie doesn't know anything anymore.

404
00:34:53,419 --> 00:34:54,946
What the hell do you want?

405
00:34:55,019 --> 00:34:56,907
I know about your brother.

406
00:34:59,117 --> 00:35:02,566
I know he died
choking on exhaust fumes.

407
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:05,127
You don't know shit, kid.

408
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:08,583
My brother died
'cause he wanted to.

409
00:35:08,656 --> 00:35:10,794
He ran a rubber hose
from the exhaust pipe.

410
00:35:10,864 --> 00:35:13,735
Arnie wouldn't have bought it
if he'd known somebody died in it.

411
00:35:15,377 --> 00:35:17,745
Either you're dumb or you
don't know your friend very well.

412
00:35:18,611 --> 00:35:21,263
He had the same look
my brother always had.

413
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:27,179
Probably the only thing my brother
ever loved in his life was that car.

414
00:35:27,255 --> 00:35:31,860
No shitter ever came between him
and Christine. If they did, watch out.

415
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:37,333
His five-year-old daughter choked to
death in it. He wouldn't get rid of it.

416
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:41,265
He rode around without a care
in the world except for Christine.

417
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:45,876
Only time I ever interfered
was when Rita killed herself.

418
00:35:45,948 --> 00:35:49,397
- Who's Rita?
- His wife!

419
00:35:49,469 --> 00:35:51,858
He didn't care
a rat's ass about her.

420
00:35:51,933 --> 00:35:54,105
She died the same way he did.

421
00:35:54,174 --> 00:35:56,925
Then I made him get rid of it.

422
00:35:56,991 --> 00:36:00,505
For decency, you know.

423
00:36:00,576 --> 00:36:02,716
Of course, the car came back
three weeks later.

424
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:04,696
What do you mean, "came back"?

425
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,442
Keep a-knockin', but you can't come in

426
00:37:16,888 --> 00:37:19,573
Come back tomorrow night
and try it again

427
00:37:19,642 --> 00:37:22,360
You said you loved me
and you can't come in

428
00:37:22,427 --> 00:37:24,282
You said you loved me

429
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:06,209
All right. Fifty.
Pass on go.

430
00:38:06,281 --> 00:38:08,136
Ready?

431
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,717
Want me to go deep or flat?

432
00:38:11,786 --> 00:38:14,656
Flat. I'll hit you
on the second shot comin' around.

433
00:38:27,695 --> 00:38:29,223
Hey, Trelawney.

434
00:38:29,297 --> 00:38:32,558
- Is that Cuntingham's car?
- Yep.

435
00:38:33,713 --> 00:38:35,568
I know where he keeps it.

436
00:38:52,695 --> 00:38:54,638
Down...

437
00:38:54,712 --> 00:38:56,273
set, go!

438
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:27,906
Fucking shit!

439
00:39:38,405 --> 00:39:40,381
Get a stretcher!
Come on!

440
00:40:37,944 --> 00:40:39,603
"5,000 Dirty Limericks."

441
00:40:41,146 --> 00:40:44,246
Ought to keep you busy for a while.

442
00:40:44,315 --> 00:40:47,131
This is the third time
I've come by.

443
00:40:47,196 --> 00:40:50,907
Must be dynamite drugs.
You're always asleep.

444
00:40:50,974 --> 00:40:52,828
Doesn't quite kill the pain.

445
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:58,363
Rockbridge hasn't won a game
since you got hurt.

446
00:40:58,431 --> 00:41:00,155
That makes you a hero, right?

447
00:41:01,216 --> 00:41:05,626
Did I tell you that I'm not gonna
be playing football again? Ever.

448
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:11,387
The doctor said that
one centimeter more...

449
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,395
and I would have been paralyzed
trom the waist down.

450
00:41:16,965 --> 00:41:18,656
Shitters did some job on you, huh?

451
00:41:20,935 --> 00:41:23,783
So what's this
about you and Leigh Cabot?

452
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:30,759
- We like each other okay.
- Ho-ho. Listen to Mr. Cool.

453
00:41:30,826 --> 00:41:34,055
She just happens to be
the most beautiful girl in the school.

454
00:41:34,123 --> 00:41:38,434
Well, it's not what you think.
I really...

455
00:41:38,508 --> 00:41:40,483
respect her mind.

456
00:41:40,557 --> 00:41:42,762
She lusts after my body.
What can I say?

457
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:44,205
Fuck you.

458
00:41:47,472 --> 00:41:49,577
I saw you guys at the football game.

459
00:41:51,729 --> 00:41:54,118
How'd you ever get that car
tixed up like that?

460
00:41:54,193 --> 00:41:58,351
Oh, just plain
old-fashioned hard work.

461
00:41:59,955 --> 00:42:01,385
I still can't keep her at home.

462
00:42:01,459 --> 00:42:03,948
Mom says it makes
the yard look crowded.

463
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:07,153
I'm surprised they let you register it.

464
00:42:07,222 --> 00:42:09,743
I told them it they didn't,
I'd drop school.

465
00:42:09,815 --> 00:42:11,888
Are you serious?

466
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:20,056
They just don't want me to grow up
because they'd have to face getting old.

467
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:33,495
Has it ever occurred to you...

468
00:42:33,566 --> 00:42:36,763
that part of being a parent...

469
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:38,936
is trying to kill your kids?

470
00:42:41,984 --> 00:42:43,894
See you around, pal.

471
00:43:33,104 --> 00:43:35,015
I'm sorry, Arnie. I can't.

472
00:43:55,992 --> 00:43:58,960
What's the matter?
What's wrong?

473
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:03,345
I can't. Here.

474
00:44:06,587 --> 00:44:08,443
In that car.

475
00:44:10,653 --> 00:44:12,509
What are you talking about?
Why not?

476
00:44:14,525 --> 00:44:16,151
'Cause I hate that car.

477
00:44:16,222 --> 00:44:19,639
You care more about that car
than me.

478
00:44:23,297 --> 00:44:24,727
That's crazy, Leigh.

479
00:44:24,801 --> 00:44:26,657
Who do you spend
more time with?

480
00:44:30,563 --> 00:44:34,655
Look...
You're gonna get a cold. Come on.

481
00:45:00,204 --> 00:45:03,336
I thought girls are supposed to
be jealous of other girls, not cars.

482
00:45:04,846 --> 00:45:06,221
This car's a girl.

483
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:07,781
Oh, please.

484
00:45:11,984 --> 00:45:13,707
Cut it out. Don't.

485
00:45:13,776 --> 00:45:17,739
What? You don't like me
slapping your girl?

486
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:30,416
It seems like nobody
likes my car these days.

487
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:53,848
Oh, shit!

488
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:08,193
You're mine

489
00:46:09,123 --> 00:46:11,939
And we belong

490
00:46:12,004 --> 00:46:15,649
Together

491
00:46:15,716 --> 00:46:20,769
Yes, we belong together

492
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:34,688
Yes, it belongs to only me

493
00:46:56,465 --> 00:46:59,401
What the hell
are you doing?

494
00:46:59,475 --> 00:47:02,443
Get your goddamn
hands off her!

495
00:47:30,941 --> 00:47:33,080
Whoa, whoa! Hey!

496
00:47:35,646 --> 00:47:37,719
You gonna be all right?

497
00:47:38,879 --> 00:47:40,538
Yeah, I'm fine now.

498
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:42,878
You scared the hell out of me.

499
00:47:42,945 --> 00:47:44,920
Then get rid of that car.

500
00:47:46,945 --> 00:47:49,335
I'm not going in it again.

501
00:47:49,411 --> 00:47:53,122
Wait a minute. Don't you blame
your choking on Christine.

502
00:47:53,188 --> 00:47:55,043
It happened, Arnie.

503
00:47:55,108 --> 00:47:58,655
When I choked, something happened.
The radio came on.

504
00:47:59,685 --> 00:48:02,850
- Everything got bright.
- So, what are you saying?

505
00:48:04,487 --> 00:48:06,724
I could've died,
and you couldn't even help.

506
00:48:06,792 --> 00:48:08,735
My door was locked.

507
00:48:08,809 --> 00:48:10,697
You didn't want that man
to help me either!

508
00:48:10,761 --> 00:48:14,178
I thought he was attacking you!
I could have done the Heimlich maneuver.

509
00:48:14,251 --> 00:48:15,657
But you didn't.

510
00:48:17,195 --> 00:48:20,644
There are other things.
That radio.

511
00:48:21,008 --> 00:48:24,204
All it gets is those old songs.

512
00:48:24,272 --> 00:48:26,246
Sometimes when we're making out...

513
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:29,318
it just stalls.

514
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:31,244
As if the car
were jealous, Arnie.

515
00:48:32,558 --> 00:48:34,499
A goddamn car!

516
00:48:37,739 --> 00:48:39,233
I'Il get it.

517
00:48:40,235 --> 00:48:42,144
Know what I think?

518
00:48:42,218 --> 00:48:44,967
I think you're just
sexually frustrated.

519
00:48:54,727 --> 00:48:56,449
I'm sorry, okay?

520
00:48:58,374 --> 00:49:00,894
Can I at least call you tomorrow?

521
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:11,009
I don't know.

522
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:38,328
Come on.

523
00:49:48,663 --> 00:49:50,703
Come on, baby, please.

524
00:49:50,775 --> 00:49:53,676
It's all right.
Everything is the same.

525
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:01,106
I love you like I do

526
00:50:06,515 --> 00:50:08,653
Don't know why I love you

527
00:50:08,722 --> 00:50:11,143
Don't know why I care

528
00:50:15,695 --> 00:50:20,134
I wonder why I love you like I do

529
00:50:20,205 --> 00:50:21,896
Is it because

530
00:50:21,966 --> 00:50:24,485
I know you love me too

531
00:51:49,653 --> 00:51:51,507
Check this out!

532
00:52:44,709 --> 00:52:47,457
Keep a-knockin',
but you can't come in

533
00:53:01,663 --> 00:53:06,070
I'll just be a second. I just have to
get my wallet out of Christine.

534
00:53:07,838 --> 00:53:10,172
Want to come in with me?

535
00:53:11,389 --> 00:53:12,763
Please.

536
00:53:28,664 --> 00:53:32,340
You know, I've been thinking.

537
00:53:32,407 --> 00:53:34,861
Maybe we should apply
to the same colleges next year.

538
00:53:38,164 --> 00:53:40,138
- Really?
- Yeah.

539
00:53:40,212 --> 00:53:42,219
If we get accepted
by the same schools...

540
00:53:42,292 --> 00:53:46,546
we could take it as a sign of fate.

541
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:49,708
You'd have me to help you
through math, and if...

542
00:53:52,273 --> 00:53:55,207
Arnie, what's wrong?

543
00:54:45,794 --> 00:54:47,648
Who did this?

544
00:55:06,171 --> 00:55:09,204
Don't touch me, shitter!
This is just what you wanted!

545
00:55:09,275 --> 00:55:11,347
You get away from her!

546
00:55:14,938 --> 00:55:16,792
Arnie, I'm sorry.

547
00:55:19,287 --> 00:55:20,847
Sorry?

548
00:55:20,919 --> 00:55:22,293
Yes.

549
00:55:23,478 --> 00:55:26,957
I...
That is, we...

550
00:55:27,029 --> 00:55:28,655
It's your fault.

551
00:55:30,196 --> 00:55:34,385
If you hadn't been so damn selfish that
you wouldn't let me park my own car...

552
00:55:34,452 --> 00:55:36,687
in your precious driveway,
this never would have happened.

553
00:55:37,682 --> 00:55:39,176
That's not fair.

554
00:55:39,249 --> 00:55:41,453
Oh, it's tair.

555
00:55:43,377 --> 00:55:46,376
Can't we even talk about this...

556
00:55:46,448 --> 00:55:48,302
like rational human beings?

557
00:55:48,368 --> 00:55:50,953
One of them took a shit
on the dashboard of my car, Ma.

558
00:55:51,023 --> 00:55:53,259
How's that for rational, huh?

559
00:55:56,846 --> 00:55:58,633
Why don't we...

560
00:56:00,875 --> 00:56:03,777
Your mother and I have decided
to help you buy a new car.

561
00:56:08,202 --> 00:56:11,550
Well, that's what
everybody wants, isn't it?

562
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,433
Well, fuck you.

563
00:56:15,496 --> 00:56:17,950
I'm fixing up Christine.

564
00:56:24,997 --> 00:56:28,379
Listen, mister, you've been
disrespectful to us once too often!

565
00:56:28,452 --> 00:56:30,753
You apologize to your mother
right now!

566
00:56:30,819 --> 00:56:32,990
Take your mitts off me, motherfucker!

567
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:42,998
I'm hittin' the sack.

568
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,709
We'll make it better, huh?

569
00:57:15,383 --> 00:57:17,138
Can't hurt us anymore...

570
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:20,499
not if we work together.

571
00:57:23,124 --> 00:57:25,458
We'll show those shitters
what we can do.

572
00:58:11,015 --> 00:58:12,541
Show me.

573
01:00:10,468 --> 01:00:12,769
Little bitty pretty one

574
01:00:12,835 --> 01:00:14,810
Come on, come to me

575
01:00:15,811 --> 01:00:17,752
Lovey dovey, lovely one

576
01:00:17,826 --> 01:00:20,246
Until I'm on my knees

577
01:00:52,408 --> 01:00:54,164
Is that you, Cunningham?

578
01:00:58,838 --> 01:01:01,073
Hey, you ain't mad, are ya?

579
01:01:49,799 --> 01:01:51,325
Oh, shit.

580
01:02:53,333 --> 01:02:55,188
You're a dead man now!

581
01:03:40,135 --> 01:03:41,661
Where have you been?

582
01:03:43,366 --> 01:03:45,275
You hear about
what happened to Moochie?

583
01:03:47,717 --> 01:03:49,244
Yeah.

584
01:03:51,556 --> 01:03:54,490
Almost makes you feel sorry
for the little bastard.

585
01:04:00,961 --> 01:04:02,554
How's Christine coming?

586
01:04:02,625 --> 01:04:04,217
Oh, cherry.

587
01:04:04,288 --> 01:04:07,451
I spent a shitload ot money on her,
and she's perfecto now.

588
01:04:09,791 --> 01:04:11,895
That's funny, you know, 'cause...

589
01:04:11,966 --> 01:04:13,821
I heard she was totaled.

590
01:04:15,006 --> 01:04:18,551
After I cleaned up the broken glass,
it wasn't so bad.

591
01:04:23,035 --> 01:04:24,889
I bet you a hundred bucks...

592
01:04:26,233 --> 01:04:28,142
it was Buddy Repperton.

593
01:04:29,433 --> 01:04:30,807
Maybe.

594
01:04:30,873 --> 01:04:35,891
So what if you fix it up and he
just comes back and does it again?

595
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:37,901
He won't do it again.

596
01:04:40,278 --> 01:04:41,968
What does that mean?

597
01:04:42,037 --> 01:04:44,370
Man, I gotta go.

598
01:04:44,436 --> 01:04:47,981
I hope you didn't think
I could hang around here all day.

599
01:04:48,051 --> 01:04:50,604
Yeah, that's you, Arnie,
always in demand.

600
01:04:52,242 --> 01:04:53,616
Stay loose.

601
01:04:56,370 --> 01:04:57,896
You know it.

602
01:05:00,465 --> 01:05:02,406
Happy Thanksgiving.

603
01:05:17,164 --> 01:05:19,236
Lean machine.

604
01:05:20,555 --> 01:05:21,928
They let you out early?

605
01:05:23,593 --> 01:05:25,022
Yeah, that's right.

606
01:05:27,432 --> 01:05:30,465
I'm Rudolph Junkins,
State Police, Detective.

607
01:05:30,535 --> 01:05:33,251
I'm just missing a study hall.
I got to get to work.

608
01:05:33,319 --> 01:05:36,035
I don't care about that.
I want to ask you about your car.

609
01:05:37,094 --> 01:05:40,476
You do nice body work.
I thought this thing was totaled.

610
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:43,970
- Who told you that?
- Why, hell, everybody.

611
01:05:44,035 --> 01:05:47,449
Local police, your mom and dad,
your girl. Cute girl, by the way.

612
01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:51,166
It wasn't as bad as it looked.

613
01:05:53,633 --> 01:05:56,447
The report said
they punched holes in the body.

614
01:05:56,512 --> 01:05:58,367
Damned if I can see the fill.

615
01:05:58,432 --> 01:06:00,536
You can if you look.

616
01:06:00,607 --> 01:06:03,061
It's right over there...

617
01:06:03,134 --> 01:06:05,206
and back here.

618
01:06:05,278 --> 01:06:08,757
I've been lucky with parts.
I replaced the entire door on this side.

619
01:06:08,828 --> 01:06:11,478
- Yeah?
- See where the paint doesn't match?

620
01:06:13,467 --> 01:06:17,656
Nope. A hell of a job, Arnie.

621
01:06:17,722 --> 01:06:19,412
Well, thank you very much.

622
01:06:45,234 --> 01:06:46,990
So what do you want?

623
01:06:47,057 --> 01:06:50,798
I really like this shade of red.
Didn't think they made this anymore.

624
01:06:50,864 --> 01:06:52,969
Do they still make this shade?

625
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:55,723
Well, they must.
I bought it, didn't I?

626
01:06:55,792 --> 01:06:59,206
- Where?
- Baker Auto out on Route 5.

627
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:03,497
- You still got the receipt?
- Tossed it out.

628
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:10,311
You know, it's funny...
Cigarette?

629
01:07:10,379 --> 01:07:11,971
No, thanks.

630
01:07:12,042 --> 01:07:15,075
Usually when somebody trashes a car,
we get photographs.

631
01:07:15,145 --> 01:07:18,308
Wait. They didn't really trash it.

632
01:07:18,376 --> 01:07:20,416
That's not what Leigh said.

633
01:07:20,489 --> 01:07:23,553
She was so shaken up,
giving me all the details...

634
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:25,215
she broke down crying.

635
01:07:25,286 --> 01:07:27,173
I understand...

636
01:07:28,677 --> 01:07:32,702
one ot the perpetrators
defecated on the dashboard.

637
01:07:32,772 --> 01:07:35,389
I would've thought you'd
be madder than hell at that...

638
01:07:35,459 --> 01:07:38,208
and I would've thought
you would've reported that.

639
01:07:39,043 --> 01:07:41,082
Shit wipes off.

640
01:07:42,337 --> 01:07:45,151
Moochie Welch
kind of got wiped off too.

641
01:07:47,296 --> 01:07:48,670
I don't know.

642
01:07:48,735 --> 01:07:51,734
- You don't know?
- No.

643
01:07:51,807 --> 01:07:53,268
Scout's honor?

644
01:07:54,142 --> 01:07:55,996
I'm not a Scout.

645
01:07:57,406 --> 01:08:00,983
The kid was cut in half. They had
to scrape his legs up with a shovel.

646
01:08:01,053 --> 01:08:03,866
Isn't that what you're supposed
to do with shit...

647
01:08:03,931 --> 01:08:06,036
scrape it up with a shovel?

648
01:08:07,610 --> 01:08:09,552
Don't get smart with me, son.

649
01:08:10,937 --> 01:08:13,654
Your girlfriend is
more convincing than you are.

650
01:08:20,535 --> 01:08:22,541
She's not my girlfriend.

651
01:08:22,614 --> 01:08:25,842
And since when is it against the law
to fix your own car...

652
01:08:25,908 --> 01:08:28,112
when somebody else busts it up?

653
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:29,903
Since never.

654
01:08:30,931 --> 01:08:32,786
Then you get otf my back.

655
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:55,722
I need to see you.

656
01:08:57,580 --> 01:08:59,881
I care about you.

657
01:09:04,138 --> 01:09:05,730
Look, I love you.

658
01:09:07,721 --> 01:09:10,241
I think we deserve one more try.

659
01:09:11,464 --> 01:09:13,919
Don't you?

660
01:09:13,992 --> 01:09:16,358
Would you give me a yes or no!

661
01:09:16,422 --> 01:09:19,236
Please don't do this to me.

662
01:09:19,301 --> 01:09:22,147
Just be straight with me.
You've had it, right?

663
01:09:22,212 --> 01:09:23,838
Well, fuck you, bitch!

664
01:10:07,895 --> 01:10:09,749
Want to do the honors?

665
01:10:12,054 --> 01:10:13,909
I'd love to bring her along.

666
01:10:13,974 --> 01:10:15,500
Sure.

667
01:10:15,573 --> 01:10:17,961
- She can earn her way.
- Bullshit.

668
01:10:18,037 --> 01:10:19,760
Let's get Vandenberg.

669
01:10:21,652 --> 01:10:23,177
Baby!

670
01:10:47,755 --> 01:10:51,333
I'll never be your beast of burden

671
01:10:52,427 --> 01:10:56,223
My back is broad
but it's a-hurtin'

672
01:10:57,417 --> 01:11:01,889
All I want is for you
to make love to me

673
01:11:11,078 --> 01:11:13,314
I've walked for miles

674
01:11:13,381 --> 01:11:15,290
My feet are hurtin'

675
01:11:17,859 --> 01:11:19,386
Asshole.

676
01:11:22,881 --> 01:11:24,539
Watch this.

677
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:33,181
Let's give this asshole
some of his own medicine.

678
01:11:37,694 --> 01:11:39,482
He's backing up too.

679
01:12:13,619 --> 01:12:16,139
Some shithead's following me!

680
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:19,246
I hope he comes in here!

681
01:12:46,794 --> 01:12:49,476
- Is that Cunningham?
- It can't be.

682
01:12:51,016 --> 01:12:52,903
Look at my car.

683
01:12:52,967 --> 01:12:55,684
Come on, prick!
We're not finished yet.

684
01:12:57,414 --> 01:12:58,691
Come on!

685
01:16:03,697 --> 01:16:06,030
Hello, Henry? This is Will.

686
01:16:06,096 --> 01:16:08,168
Listen. Cunningham get there?

687
01:16:09,423 --> 01:16:11,277
The order okay?

688
01:16:11,342 --> 01:16:12,902
Good.

689
01:16:12,974 --> 01:16:15,788
Listen. He was driving
my Caddy, wasn't he?

690
01:16:17,293 --> 01:16:19,780
Good. Yes. Take it easy.

691
01:16:50,019 --> 01:16:53,793
Okay, Jack. Come on out.

692
01:16:55,777 --> 01:16:57,500
The ride is over.

693
01:17:00,865 --> 01:17:04,661
If I'm gonna have to come in
and get ya...

694
01:17:04,736 --> 01:17:06,360
I'm gonna get ya.

695
01:17:21,531 --> 01:17:24,498
Why don't you do us both a favor.

696
01:17:24,570 --> 01:17:26,259
Come on out.

697
01:18:27,815 --> 01:18:30,497
I got a girl named Bony Moronie

698
01:18:33,317 --> 01:18:36,131
She's as skinny
as a stick of macaroni

699
01:18:38,596 --> 01:18:41,760
Oughta see her rock and roll
with her blue jeans on

700
01:18:43,235 --> 01:18:44,664
What?

701
01:18:44,739 --> 01:18:47,584
Not very fat
Just skin and bone

702
01:18:50,304 --> 01:18:52,987
I love her and she loves me

703
01:18:53,056 --> 01:18:55,773
We're all happy now
as we can be

704
01:18:55,839 --> 01:18:58,424
Makin' love
underneath the apple tree

705
01:19:01,438 --> 01:19:04,405
Well, I told her mama
and her papa too

706
01:19:44,562 --> 01:19:46,415
- What's goin' on?
- You tell me.

707
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:48,335
- Where were you last night?
- Home.

708
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:50,854
- What are you doing to my car?
- You didn't go out at all?

709
01:19:51,727 --> 01:19:55,882
Of course I went out. I got Darnell's
car out front with a load of parts.

710
01:19:55,949 --> 01:19:58,021
- You want the receipt?
- Yeah.

711
01:20:07,306 --> 01:20:09,695
How come you're showing up just now?

712
01:20:09,770 --> 01:20:12,322
Why didn't you unload
the stuff last night?

713
01:20:12,393 --> 01:20:14,280
Because I was tired, that's why.

714
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:19,206
If you don't believe me,
you can ask my mother.

715
01:20:19,271 --> 01:20:22,086
Why do you keep
butting into my life?

716
01:20:22,151 --> 01:20:26,426
Because we found your boss,
Will Darnell, dead in your front seat...

717
01:20:26,501 --> 01:20:28,540
with a shotgun by his side.

718
01:20:43,713 --> 01:20:47,737
- Why?
- I was hoping you could answer that.

719
01:20:47,807 --> 01:20:50,872
Somebody saw your car cruising
behind Buddy Repperton last night.

720
01:20:50,942 --> 01:20:53,145
He's dead too.

721
01:20:53,213 --> 01:20:56,344
So are Don Vandenberg
and Richard Trelawney.

722
01:20:57,628 --> 01:20:59,732
Guess nobody'll be trashing
your car anymore.

723
01:21:01,435 --> 01:21:03,639
Well, all I know...

724
01:21:08,025 --> 01:21:09,715
I got a Cadillac full of parts...

725
01:21:09,784 --> 01:21:11,791
and I'm supposed to be
at school in half an hour.

726
01:21:11,864 --> 01:21:14,995
We'Il take care of the Caddy.
I don't want you touching it.

727
01:21:20,694 --> 01:21:25,101
Honest, I don't know what's going on.
I swear I don't.

728
01:21:30,226 --> 01:21:32,081
May I please speak to Dennis?

729
01:21:33,362 --> 01:21:35,271
It's a girl.

730
01:21:39,344 --> 01:21:40,772
Happy New Year.

731
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:44,548
Can I come over there?
I need to talk to you.

732
01:21:45,710 --> 01:21:48,327
- What, about Arnie?
- About Christine.

733
01:21:52,844 --> 01:21:54,469
You first.

734
01:21:57,099 --> 01:21:58,854
I'm afraid for Arnie.

735
01:22:00,330 --> 01:22:02,402
I thought you wanted to talk
about Christine.

736
01:22:02,474 --> 01:22:05,026
What do you know about that car?

737
01:22:06,472 --> 01:22:09,121
I know that the guy
who owned the car before Arnie...

738
01:22:09,191 --> 01:22:10,620
Yeah?

739
01:22:10,695 --> 01:22:13,280
His daughter choked to death
in Christine.

740
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:15,837
How do you know that?

741
01:22:15,910 --> 01:22:18,876
LeBay's brother sold Arnie the car,
and the guy's a jerk.

742
01:22:18,948 --> 01:22:23,071
- He just came out and told me.
- I think I was supposed to be next.

743
01:22:25,731 --> 01:22:27,552
Come on.

744
01:22:29,985 --> 01:22:31,839
Arnie would never do that.

745
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:35,318
Not in a million years.

746
01:22:38,911 --> 01:22:41,015
I don't think he's Arnie.

747
01:22:44,350 --> 01:22:47,763
It's that car.
I swear it's the car.

748
01:22:48,476 --> 01:22:49,752
Maybe.

749
01:22:51,035 --> 01:22:53,369
I'm going to Arnie's tonight
for New Year's...

750
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:56,401
- I wouldn't.
- It's okay.

751
01:22:56,474 --> 01:22:59,735
We do it every year.
His folks are going to be there.

752
01:22:59,801 --> 01:23:03,030
Maybe if I get him alone,
maybe he'll talk to me.

753
01:23:03,096 --> 01:23:04,470
What if he doesn't?

754
01:23:05,816 --> 01:23:09,360
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

755
01:23:09,430 --> 01:23:11,698
What if that car doesn't let him?

756
01:23:15,444 --> 01:23:17,484
Then we destroy it.

757
01:23:49,130 --> 01:23:51,104
Well, come on
let's go

758
01:23:51,178 --> 01:23:53,927
Let's go, let's go
little darlin'

759
01:23:53,993 --> 01:23:56,840
And tell me that
you'll never leave me

760
01:23:56,904 --> 01:23:59,140
Come on, come on

761
01:24:02,759 --> 01:24:06,597
Well, now, swing me, swing me
all the way down there

762
01:24:06,662 --> 01:24:09,410
Come on, let's go, little darlin'

763
01:24:09,476 --> 01:24:12,475
Let's go again once more

764
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:17,882
My man, you really operate
on those babies.

765
01:24:19,042 --> 01:24:20,700
Yeah, I manage.

766
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:24,278
We got the old rust bucket tonight.

767
01:24:24,353 --> 01:24:27,320
You wanna watch what you call my car.

768
01:24:27,392 --> 01:24:29,562
She's real sensitive.

769
01:24:29,630 --> 01:24:31,834
Is she?

770
01:24:33,725 --> 01:24:35,580
Sorry, Christine.

771
01:24:35,645 --> 01:24:37,368
Good boy.

772
01:24:38,653 --> 01:24:40,114
Let's motorvate.

773
01:25:15,634 --> 01:25:17,488
Have a beer.
Don't be shy.

774
01:25:17,553 --> 01:25:19,375
My car's your car.

775
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:28,426
A toast.

776
01:25:28,493 --> 01:25:30,119
Death...

777
01:25:30,189 --> 01:25:33,188
to the shitters
ot the world in 1979.

778
01:25:34,252 --> 01:25:36,423
Come on.
I can't drink to that.

779
01:25:37,675 --> 01:25:39,682
What can you drink to?

780
01:25:39,755 --> 01:25:42,656
What about to us?
You know, to friendship?

781
01:25:42,730 --> 01:25:46,624
Oh, friendship. Right.
That's real good.

782
01:26:07,939 --> 01:26:09,214
Come on!

783
01:26:09,281 --> 01:26:11,550
I want you to see this.

784
01:26:11,617 --> 01:26:15,293
This is great alignment.
You just don't see this anymore.

785
01:26:21,951 --> 01:26:23,544
Don't be scared.

786
01:26:25,790 --> 01:26:28,341
I'm scared for you,
for what's happened to you.

787
01:26:28,412 --> 01:26:29,939
It's this fucking car.

788
01:26:31,132 --> 01:26:32,625
I know you're jealous.

789
01:26:35,579 --> 01:26:38,229
We'll always be triends,
as long as you stick with me.

790
01:26:38,298 --> 01:26:41,493
You know what happens
to shitters who don't.

791
01:26:41,561 --> 01:26:43,731
No. What does happen?

792
01:26:44,633 --> 01:26:47,087
Let's not kid each other.

793
01:26:48,023 --> 01:26:49,483
Who are the shitters?

794
01:26:51,222 --> 01:26:53,196
All of 'em.

795
01:26:58,068 --> 01:27:00,489
Leigh's on your side.

796
01:27:00,563 --> 01:27:03,432
- Oh, yeah?
- She cares a lot about you.

797
01:27:06,546 --> 01:27:08,552
She does.

798
01:27:08,625 --> 01:27:09,835
Yeah.

799
01:27:11,088 --> 01:27:13,738
Don't you like this beer?
I thought you liked beer.

800
01:27:13,807 --> 01:27:15,662
Did you hear what I just said?

801
01:27:16,718 --> 01:27:19,587
Let me tell you
a little something about love.

802
01:27:19,662 --> 01:27:22,312
It has a voracious appetite.

803
01:27:22,381 --> 01:27:26,984
It eats everything...
friendship, family.

804
01:27:27,052 --> 01:27:29,538
It kills me, how much it eats.

805
01:27:29,610 --> 01:27:31,301
I'll tell you something else.

806
01:27:31,370 --> 01:27:33,541
Feed it right,
and it can be a beautiful thing...

807
01:27:33,610 --> 01:27:36,260
and that's what we have.

808
01:27:36,329 --> 01:27:40,005
When someone believes in you, you can do
any fucking thing in the universe...

809
01:27:40,072 --> 01:27:42,406
and when you believe right back
in that someone...

810
01:27:42,472 --> 01:27:45,570
then watch out, world,
'cause nobody can stop you ever!

811
01:27:48,869 --> 01:27:50,941
You feel this way about Leigh?

812
01:27:53,412 --> 01:27:57,273
What? Fuck, no!
I'm talkin' about Christine, man.

813
01:27:57,347 --> 01:27:59,648
No shitter ever came
between me and Christine.

814
01:28:01,186 --> 01:28:02,615
Watch this.

815
01:28:06,689 --> 01:28:08,249
Oh, shit.

816
01:28:15,421 --> 01:28:17,144
Chicken shit!

817
01:28:19,645 --> 01:28:24,084
Man, there is nothin' finer than being
behind the wheel of your own car...

818
01:28:25,275 --> 01:28:27,129
except maybe for pussy.

819
01:29:57,472 --> 01:29:59,327
It's kinda spooky in here, huh?

820
01:30:01,216 --> 01:30:04,117
Looks like they cleaned out
the whole place.

821
01:30:04,191 --> 01:30:05,881
Jesus.

822
01:30:08,446 --> 01:30:11,641
That's where he used to keep it.
Down there.

823
01:30:12,668 --> 01:30:13,715
Yeah.

824
01:30:16,282 --> 01:30:17,809
You better get started.

825
01:30:38,996 --> 01:30:40,687
Yeah!

826
01:30:40,756 --> 01:30:42,446
What do you think?

827
01:30:44,179 --> 01:30:46,600
Let's try it.

828
01:31:33,253 --> 01:31:35,259
Christine's gonna come
through the door.

829
01:31:37,667 --> 01:31:40,252
You better get in the office
and stay out of sight.

830
01:31:40,323 --> 01:31:44,097
Once she gets inside, hit the button
and bring the door down.

831
01:31:45,122 --> 01:31:46,944
Then we'Il have her trapped.

832
01:31:47,009 --> 01:31:48,863
What if he doesn't come?

833
01:31:50,176 --> 01:31:51,997
Christine will.

834
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:20,334
You better get in the office.

835
01:32:20,407 --> 01:32:22,261
Keep your head down.

836
01:32:23,798 --> 01:32:27,572
When you hear me start this thing up,
that's when you hit the button.

837
01:34:05,497 --> 01:34:08,147
Leigh, don't move!
Stay where you are!

838
01:34:41,103 --> 01:34:42,531
You shitters!

839
01:36:08,309 --> 01:36:10,284
Oh, God.

840
01:37:45,817 --> 01:37:47,191
Arnie's dead.

841
01:37:51,608 --> 01:37:54,388
I'll forever love you

842
01:37:55,766 --> 01:37:58,002
The rest of my days

843
01:37:59,765 --> 01:38:02,099
I'll never part from you

844
01:39:47,222 --> 01:39:48,748
Are you okay?

845
01:39:49,845 --> 01:39:51,471
I think so.

846
01:40:07,632 --> 01:40:09,606
Rock, rock, rock
Oh, baby

847
01:40:16,845 --> 01:40:19,212
Rock and roll is here to stay

848
01:40:19,277 --> 01:40:21,448
It will never die

849
01:40:21,516 --> 01:40:23,850
It was meant to be that way

850
01:40:23,916 --> 01:40:26,304
Though I don't know why

851
01:40:26,379 --> 01:40:28,647
I don't care what people say

852
01:40:28,715 --> 01:40:31,267
Rock and roll is here to stay

853
01:40:31,338 --> 01:40:33,671
We don't care what people say

854
01:40:36,136 --> 01:40:38,077
Rock and roll will always be

855
01:40:38,151 --> 01:40:40,900
I dig it to the end

856
01:40:40,966 --> 01:40:43,355
It'll go down in history

857
01:40:43,430 --> 01:40:45,601
Just you watch, my friend

858
01:40:45,669 --> 01:40:48,156
Rock and roll will always be

859
01:40:48,229 --> 01:40:50,596
It'll go down in history

860
01:41:09,375 --> 01:41:13,149
I wouldn't feel so bad, if I were you.
You two are heroes, you know.

861
01:41:13,214 --> 01:41:17,368
Yeah. A real hero
could've saved Arnie.

862
01:41:17,435 --> 01:41:19,507
We didn't do so hot.

863
01:41:19,579 --> 01:41:21,913
Some things can't be helped.

864
01:41:21,978 --> 01:41:24,247
Some people too.

865
01:41:24,314 --> 01:41:25,688
Yeah.

866
01:41:34,039 --> 01:41:36,689
I love you so, dear

867
01:41:36,758 --> 01:41:39,343
And I'll never let you go

868
01:41:39,413 --> 01:41:42,729
Come on, baby, so

869
01:41:43,541 --> 01:41:45,363
God, I hate rock and roll.
