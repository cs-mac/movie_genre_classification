1
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:52,649
Put your right hand over your heart.

2
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:54,812
Ready? Begin.

3
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:58,824
I pledge allegiance to the flag...

4
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:03,260
of the United States of America.

5
00:01:03,364 --> 00:01:05,832
The cries of pain.

6
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:08,595
The shattered lives...

7
00:01:08,703 --> 00:01:11,001
the devastation.

8
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:14,268
Maybe we as a people
have gotten too used to the wars...

9
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:17,606
that we have seen in the movies.

10
00:01:17,712 --> 00:01:21,239
Because in this footage,
it becomes terribly apparent...

11
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:23,510
that there is
no triumphant music...

12
00:01:23,618 --> 00:01:25,779
there is no victorious hero.

13
00:01:25,887 --> 00:01:31,018
There is only the horrible
reality of human suffering.

14
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:34,185
This war isn't glamorous
or romantic.

15
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:37,594
It is rather a brutal reminder
of the violence...

16
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:41,099
that man is capable of.

17
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:44,296
And it leaves little doubt
in this reporter's mind...

18
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:48,205
that this war,
and perhaps all war...

19
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:51,210
is undeniably evil.

20
00:02:02,657 --> 00:02:05,148
Take this down. That's a girl.

21
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:07,989
I split it in half,
so there's one for tomorrow.

22
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:10,495
That's a girl.

23
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:18,669
When California Governor
Ronald Reagan was asked today...

24
00:02:18,773 --> 00:02:21,693
about his opposition to the proposed
expansion of Redwood National Park...

25
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:24,802
his response was- and I quote-

26
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:29,815
"A tree is a tree.
How many more do you need to look at?'"

27
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:33,045
In other news, censorship-

28
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,317
Hello. Yeah, okay.

29
00:02:37,425 --> 00:02:39,689
Look, look, I 'm on the way.
I 'm on the bloody way!

30
00:02:39,794 --> 00:02:42,695
Come on, son.
We gotta go. Come on.

31
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:13,757
No more logging!

32
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:16,762
Go home, murderers!
You're all murderers!

33
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:20,129
Get out of here!
This land isn't yours!

34
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:22,532
No more logging! No more!

35
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:26,163
You're murderers, all of you!
Don't deny it! You're killin' trees!

36
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:27,377
What do we got here, Burt?

37
00:03:27,402 --> 00:03:30,290
They just keep coming back. How
are we supposed to do our job?

38
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:33,677
We're gonna have to go through 'em.

39
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:35,612
All right, you heard him.

40
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,877
Let's do it.

41
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:40,010
You're all murderers!

42
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:49,023
Do you know why we fall these trees?
To build houses.

43
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,025
Houses for families.

44
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,419
I don't give a damn about
you or your families.

45
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,335
Look, my wife is sick.
She needs medication.

46
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,930
And if she doesn't get it,
she's gonna die.

47
00:04:01,042 --> 00:04:05,172
And you're making it impossible
for a man to do an honest day's work.

48
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:08,248
If your wife has to die
to save these trees...

49
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:10,249
so be it.

50
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:12,819
You-

51
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,354
Who's gonna save you?

52
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,489
You son of a bitch!

53
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,926
You okay? You okay?

54
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,932
Yeah. I-

55
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:30,367
He's got a gun!

56
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:32,939
Hold on! Hold it right there!

57
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,531
Everybody just calm down.
Let me take that.

58
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:37,372
- Come on. Come on.
- He hit me first.

59
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:39,969
- He started it!
- You're gonna go with me.

60
00:04:40,081 --> 00:04:43,346
- Goddamn it! Can't a man work anymore?
- I gotta run you in.

61
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:45,544
- Daddy!
- It's all right, lad. It'll be all right.

62
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:49,487
We're gonna stay here until
we get the petition to save these trees!

63
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,855
Yeah? And what is that petition
made out of? Paper, you moron!

64
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,623
- Paper from trees!
- Not from trees...

65
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:00,291
that were around
before the birth of Christ!

66
00:05:03,237 --> 00:05:05,364
No!

67
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,700
No! No!

68
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,378
No! No!

69
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:26,190
No! Let him go!
I'll kill every one of ya!

70
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:30,252
I swear to God,
I'll kill every last one of ya!

71
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:32,355
Dad!

72
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:18,936
And the home of the free -

73
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,207
- - Brave - -

74
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:23,579
Mmm. Creamy goodness.

75
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:26,551
Should he be driving?

76
00:06:26,654 --> 00:06:29,452
No. I'll drive.

77
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:32,720
It's the drugs that hold
Joey together.

78
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:35,454
- Right, burly man?
- Oh, yeah.

79
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,234
- Here.
- No, thanks.

80
00:06:46,207 --> 00:06:49,938
Sam, see the nest
up there at the top of that tree?

81
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:52,502
Oh, yeah.

82
00:06:52,527 --> 00:06:55,197
That's the nest of an
American bald eagle.

83
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:58,877
Hey, Captain. Hard to starboard.
I need to take a bio break.

84
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:02,114
- Me too.
- Aye, aye, mates.

85
00:07:02,223 --> 00:07:05,852
- Here you go. One-stop shopping.
- Ew. Come on, dude.

86
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,010
It's dripping!

87
00:07:07,035 --> 00:07:10,182
Ivan, you man the cannon.
Samantha steadies the aim.

88
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,494
Joey, look out!

89
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:19,705
Whoa.

90
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:25,344
- What the fuck was that?
- I think it was a dog.

91
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:28,609
- Really? I hate dogs.
- How could you hate dogs?

92
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:30,616
It's probably gone now.

93
00:07:30,718 --> 00:07:33,551
Ladies' room to the right,
big boy.

94
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:36,418
- Jack, come with me.
- Sorry, babe. I'm afraid of dogs too.

95
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:38,718
Oh, you're such a chicken shit!

96
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,010
- Someone's giving you a hummer.
- What?

97
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,554
Your phone. Who's calling?

98
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:11,648
Uh, nobody.

99
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,160
Are you hanging in there?

100
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:20,427
Yeah, I guess. As long
as Jimmy's not around, I'm fine.

101
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:23,662
Hey, this is gonna
be great for you.

102
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,897
Yo, guys. Watch out
for booby traps.

103
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,498
- Watch out for what?
- Booby traps.

104
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,510
What? Where?

105
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:33,603
What fuckin' booby-

106
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,416
I've been hit!

107
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,851
Dude, you all right?

108
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:41,938
Ow, fuck!

109
00:08:41,963 --> 00:08:44,914
Let me see. I gotta make
sure there's no glass in it.

110
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:47,358
Who the fuck were those guys?

111
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:49,691
I don't know, but we gotta
be careful out here, man.

112
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:52,732
The pot farmers catch us in their shit,
they'll chop our balls off...

113
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,063
and use 'em as fertilizer
for their crops.

114
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:58,696
Sounds like the perfect spot
for an outdoor music festival.

115
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:01,070
Ow! Jesus Christ, Samantha!

116
00:09:01,175 --> 00:09:03,370
I didn't mean to.

117
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:06,605
- I didn't mean to.
- It hurts.

118
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:08,711
I could sew that shit
up for you, if you want.

119
00:09:08,736 --> 00:09:09,400
What?

120
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:12,680
I have some needle
and thread in here.

121
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:16,586
Just run a lighter over it.
It's all clean.

122
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:20,148
- No, thanks, man.
- Do it, pussy!

123
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,928
- That shit will be sick.
- That shit's nasty.

124
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:23,506
- That shit will be sick.
- That shit's nasty.

125
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:26,294
- Do it.
- I'll do it.

126
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,300
Rambo style.

127
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,632
You're bleeding
and it's really deep.

128
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:34,299
We need to get
some disinfectant.

129
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,433
Go get me some of that whiskey.

130
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:38,443
Yes. Rambo.

131
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:41,309
Rambo! Rambo! Rambo!

132
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:44,646
Who's Rambo?

133
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:48,779
Okay. Do it.

134
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:51,414
Whoa!

135
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:57,857
I'm Rambo. I am Rambo.

136
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,966
Ah, fuck!

137
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:18,046
I can't watch, man.
I feel light-headed.

138
00:10:18,152 --> 00:10:20,677
Yes!

139
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:23,414
My fellow Americans...

140
00:10:23,524 --> 00:10:27,290
major combat operations
in Iraq have ended.

141
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:29,294
And the battle of Iraq-

142
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:33,025
You know, he's not just
the greatest American president...

143
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,101
he's just-

144
00:10:36,537 --> 00:10:38,505
Wow.

145
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:44,901
- Asshole tried to piss on my head.
- It's sterile.

146
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:47,105
Yeah, thanks.
I'll get some medicine.

147
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:50,479
- Pee-pee party.
- You want to get high?

148
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:52,552
- Yo.
- Oh.

149
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:06,591
What's wrong with her?
She seems kind of damaged.

150
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,600
- Who, Sam?
- Yeah.

151
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:12,138
- She's going through some shit right now.
- Like what?

152
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:14,867
- Ivan didn't tell you guys?
- No.

153
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:17,375
She wasn't always so tweaky.

154
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:20,606
She just got out of
a really fucked-up relationship.

155
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:24,980
Oh, my God.
This ecstasy is really strong.

156
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,820
You're candy flipping.
We took "X" and acid.

157
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:34,624
Acid too?

158
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:38,664
You know that liquid stuff
that we put on our tongues?

159
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:40,960
That wasn't mouthwash.

160
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:02,465
Jimmy was her old boyfriend.

161
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:05,253
A rich, spoiled brat
who couldn't handle being dumped.

162
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:08,209
And apparently he wasn't used
to not getting his own way.

163
00:12:08,234 --> 00:12:09,234
Samantha!

164
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,558
Jimmy? What are you doing here?

165
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,831
- Jimmy, please.
- Excuse us.

166
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:20,907
Jimmy.

167
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,704
- Are you fucked up? Are you fucked up?
- No. No!

168
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:28,508
- Did you give her shit?
- Fuck off, Jimmy!

169
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:31,413
You don't tell me to fuck off, pig.

170
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:33,918
What did I tell you, Samantha?
What did I tell you?

171
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:35,955
This cunt is bad news!

172
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:39,253
- Fuck you, asshole!
- Why are you so angry?

173
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:42,760
Why am I so angry?
Why am I so angry?

174
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:49,130
Sam had never tripped before.
So when Jimmy flipped out, she lost it.

175
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:52,228
I ask you to stay.
You fuckin' leave.

176
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:54,864
I don't get it.
I fuckin' love you!

177
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:58,467
- I love you, Samantha.
- No.

178
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:00,706
You're making a fool of yourself.

179
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:02,975
You don't love me.

180
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,289
- Help!
- Drugs are killing this fucking nation!

181
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:14,383
- Somebody help!
- Destroying your brain.

182
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,485
Frying out!

183
00:13:16,597 --> 00:13:18,656
I fucking love you!

184
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,515
Shit.

185
00:13:42,623 --> 00:13:44,557
You break it, you buy it.

186
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:50,861
Jodie Foster was great in that.

187
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:54,195
Jodie Foster wasn't in that one.
Linda Blair was in The Exorcist.

188
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:57,668
Yeah, The Exorcist. The priest.
And the possessed demon was Regan.

189
00:13:57,771 --> 00:14:00,934
Yeah, but it wasn't
President Reagan.

190
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,872
I could see how
you could get it confused.

191
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:05,103
Hey, beer.

192
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:08,113
- It has to last.
- Hey, where's Sam?

193
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:12,015
- She's inside.
- Go get her. Chop, chop.

194
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:14,781
- Chop, chop.
- All right.

195
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:17,413
- You heard him, man. It has to last.
- All right.

196
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,355
Sam?

197
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:21,359
Easy, tiger.

198
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:24,328
Whoa, dude.

199
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:26,922
Yo, man, that's the truck!
That's the truck from-

200
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:29,798
Come on. Let's go.

201
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:32,565
- You sure are cranky.
- You keep talkin' shit.

202
00:14:32,673 --> 00:14:35,403
The rednecks just
pulled up in the truck.

203
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:37,534
- What?
- The dude who threw the bottle at ya.

204
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:40,772
What's the matter with you, dude?
You got something stuck in your vagina?

205
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:42,781
Yeah, your mama's dick.

206
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:45,443
- What the hell is that supposed to mean?
- I don't fucking know.

207
00:14:54,795 --> 00:14:57,025
Good morning, Spike. Coffee-

208
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,030
I wanna fucking
kill these guys, man.

209
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:00,963
You might not wanna
do that, bro.

210
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:02,716
There's three of us,
there's three of them.

211
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,913
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

212
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:06,269
Plus, it's a well-known fact
that rednecks love their guns.

213
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:09,769
That's the motherfucker
I hit with the bottle.

214
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:13,275
- Don't be a pussy.
- I enjoy being a pussy.

215
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,314
- We should just leave.
- Yes.

216
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:19,010
Hey, you toothless, redneck pig fuckers,
you want some trouble?

217
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:21,349
Huh?

218
00:15:21,455 --> 00:15:24,856
'Cause my buddy here
was just wonderin'.

219
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,323
Who?

220
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:34,597
This-
This John Lennon-lookin' fella here?

221
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:37,363
He wants to fight?

222
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:41,373
- Thanks a lot, Joey.
- No problem. Bust a Jihad on his ass!

223
00:15:41,475 --> 00:15:44,535
- Shh.
- Ivan.

224
00:15:45,846 --> 00:15:49,111
- Whoa.
- What's going on?

225
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:51,548
Tell these guys
we don't want any trouble.

226
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,416
But your boyfriend here
is looking for trouble.

227
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,297
What do you expect?

228
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:56,949
- You threw a bottle.
- Hey, I thought that you deadheads...

229
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:59,958
believed in flower power
and shit.

230
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,460
Yeah, make love, not war.

231
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:07,192
Come on now. Just turn your scrawny
ass around and snuggle up to Yoko there...

232
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,736
- before you collect yourself a U.S.D.A.
- choice ass whoopin'.

233
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:13,362
- Stupid motherfuckers. Bring it on.
- You asked for it.

234
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:17,000
Oh! Not the knife, Muff.

235
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,404
Let's make us
some veggie burgers.

236
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:24,982
Whoa!

237
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:28,248
- Kick his ass!
- I'll kick your ass, bitch!

238
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:36,091
Come on, baby.
Let's kiss and make up.

239
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:37,925
Get off me!

240
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:40,829
Jesus, Muff. Settle down. Shit.

241
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:42,993
Holy shit.

242
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:49,400
What a pussy!

243
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:53,672
Thank you.

244
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,510
Thank you, sir.

245
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:14,927
Hello? Hello?

246
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,228
Samantha?

247
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:20,806
Samantha!

248
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:24,934
I know you're there. I know you're there!
Talk to me. Samantha-

249
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:33,142
I can't believe you'd fucking
do this to me. You're such a bitch.

250
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:35,813
- You are such a fucking bitch!
- Gus?

251
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:38,891
Goddamn it, Gus.
Get your ass out back...

252
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:43,292
and finish cleaning those grease traps
before those mangy dogs get at 'em.

253
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:47,332
- I fucking love violence!
- Shit, girl. Now I need another hit.

254
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:52,201
Goddamn! Ivan, your girlfriend is badass!
You know what I'm saying?

255
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:54,967
See that shit?
She got Clubber Lang on his ass.

256
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:57,635
- Who?
- Mr. T. Clubber Lang?

257
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,611
- Rocky?
- I pity the fool who don't know me.

258
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:04,241
- I didn't know you had that in you.
- You don't know shit.

259
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:08,947
I don't know why I stick it to you,
'cause you don't know shit.

260
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:11,387
Because I'm fine! That's why.

261
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:36,313
Gentlemen, there's a saying:

262
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,884
"Rome wasn't built in a day."

263
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:41,044
I got a little saying of my own:

264
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:44,590
Fuck Rome. This is America!

265
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:46,556
We can do whatever we please.

266
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,855
Some of you look a little worried.
Don't be.

267
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:51,328
We'll be out of here
first thing Monday...

268
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:55,663
and your precious little forest
won't be any the worse for wear.

269
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:58,966
Well, Mr. Baker, yours is certainly
an impressive enterprise.

270
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,867
Please call me Frank.

271
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:09,108
Well, it's just that... there's a couple
of concerns regarding, uh-

272
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:12,480
What, gate receipts,
profit sharing?

273
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:14,678
Fatalities.

274
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:19,858
Didn't some people die
at your festival last year?

275
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,327
I don't believe
we've had the pleasure.

276
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:27,127
Well, Mr. Baker, I'd like
to introduce you to...

277
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:31,761
Officer Buzz Hall, the town
of Carlyle's de facto peacekeeper.

278
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:33,771
De facto?

279
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:36,569
Our current fiscal crisis
doesn't allow for much of a staff.

280
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:40,237
Well, then you are
specifically Carlyle's finest.

281
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:42,508
Well, yes, he and Deputy Cooper.

282
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:46,051
Plus, there's a very strong park
ranger's force to help out with traffic.

283
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:48,450
Fan-fucking-tastic.

284
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:51,353
There are still some concerns however.
Buzz?

285
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:55,360
As I recall...

286
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:59,125
someone, uh, on drugs
was trampled at your festival last year...

287
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:01,700
when they couldn't get
to an exit.

288
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:05,897
A tragedy.
But I beefed up security this year.

289
00:20:06,006 --> 00:20:08,736
I heard they're the ones
that did the trampling.

290
00:20:08,842 --> 00:20:13,472
Well, then I can consider us lucky to have
you and yours to keep us safe this year.

291
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:22,381
De factoly speaking, of course.

292
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:25,556
What about the girl?

293
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,758
- What girl?
- The one who disappeared.

294
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:40,571
Buzz, you know how many kids
go runnin' off...

295
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:43,699
to follow the Grateful Dead
and whatnot.

296
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,506
- Jerry's dead.
- What?

297
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:51,243
Jerry Garcia is dead.
The Grateful Dead's no more.

298
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:53,251
She could have run off
with some other jam band.

299
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:56,447
Yeah. She could be, uh,
following the Phish.

300
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:59,320
Yeah, Phish broke up too.

301
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:02,156
Well, it concerned the folks
in Humboldt enough to shut you down.

302
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:04,856
That's why you're here in Carlyle,
isn't it, Frank?

303
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:09,634
- Buzz, can I have a word?
- Sure.

304
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:11,670
- How ya doing, son?
- Been better, been worse.

305
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,740
Uh-huh. Well, I know it. I do.

306
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:18,902
And I also know that this festival's
got your judgment a little clouded.

307
00:21:19,012 --> 00:21:21,572
My judgment?

308
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:23,512
Now look-see.

309
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,880
What do you see?
I'll tell you what I see.

310
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:28,351
I see jobs, son.

311
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:31,356
And that's just the shot
in the arm this little lumber town needs.

312
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:34,484
Not all shots
are good for you, Mayor.

313
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:40,396
Buzz, I need to know something.
Can I count on you to help pull this off?

314
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,094
You can count on me
to do my job.

315
00:21:43,203 --> 00:21:47,037
Just like I did yesterday
and just like I'll do tomorrow.

316
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,574
Is that a regulation length
mustache, Buzz?

317
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:17,769
Welcome to Free Love Festival...

318
00:22:17,871 --> 00:22:21,238
where America's best and brightest
come to celebrate-

319
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:22,240
Freedom?

320
00:22:22,265 --> 00:22:24,960
Yes, freedom to do
drugs-lots of fuckin' drugs!

321
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:27,911
- Yes!
- Speaking of which...

322
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,915
we have coke, we got speed...

323
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:34,145
we got a decent amount
of the purple hydro, buddy.

324
00:22:34,254 --> 00:22:37,223
And we got some of these pills
Jade took from her mom's pocketbook.

325
00:22:38,164 --> 00:22:40,612
Beer in the back. And
what do we got up there?

326
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,059
Looks like about
a half a sheet of acid left.

327
00:22:43,163 --> 00:22:45,961
- That's it?
- You don't think that's enough?

328
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:50,126
Well, you see, Samantha,
we are professional drug takers.

329
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:52,636
Yeah, don't try this at home.

330
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:54,832
Sam, don't worry.
It's not just about drugs.

331
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:56,966
The Free Love Festival
is a really great concert...

332
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:59,601
where peace-conscious people
gather and talk about...

333
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,044
all the shit this government's
trying to pull, you know.

334
00:23:02,148 --> 00:23:03,775
What the fuck
are you talkin' about?

335
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,783
She's talkin' about George W.
Going into Iraq...

336
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,319
and sucking the cocks
of all the corporate interests.

337
00:23:08,421 --> 00:23:09,286
Thank you.

338
00:23:09,311 --> 00:23:11,903
Shut the fuck up. George
Bush is the greatest.

339
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:14,585
The man's got balls.

340
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:16,594
Big Texas-size balls.

341
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:19,642
Probably the first man in history
to ever tell the whole world, "Fuck you."

342
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:22,328
I could do what I want,
and there ain't shit you can do about it."

343
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:25,131
George Bush is like the worst president
this country's ever had.

344
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:26,120
Yeah.

345
00:23:26,145 --> 00:23:28,789
You're just saying that 'cause
George Bush hates black people.

346
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:32,003
You're absolutely right.

347
00:23:33,346 --> 00:23:35,075
Whoa! What's that noise?

348
00:23:42,155 --> 00:23:45,124
Ah, shit.

349
00:23:45,225 --> 00:23:47,785
- What the hell!
- You okay?

350
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:49,862
Jesus Christ!

351
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:54,533
Dude, there's a fuckin' tree in the road.

352
00:23:54,634 --> 00:23:56,625
Get outta here!

353
00:23:56,736 --> 00:23:59,217
You're not wanted here!
This is the last time

354
00:23:59,242 --> 00:24:01,561
I'm gonna warn you
commie, pinko bastards.

355
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,140
Joey, don't go near him.

356
00:24:06,246 --> 00:24:09,272
I'm not.
It's the paper towel lumberjack guy.

357
00:24:09,382 --> 00:24:13,045
Hold it, hold it.
Hold it right there, Dylan Riggs. Jesus.

358
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:16,246
- Holding on. Roger that.
- Step back, please, please.

359
00:24:16,356 --> 00:24:18,517
This maniac just tried to kill us.

360
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:21,492
Dylan, what is your problem?
You could have crushed these kids.

361
00:24:21,594 --> 00:24:25,963
They're my problem-
you and these rainbows.

362
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:29,125
This ain't their goddamn forest.
Goddamn it!

363
00:24:29,235 --> 00:24:32,068
It's not your forest either.
You know, I could haul your ass in...

364
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:35,140
for felling this tree,
you crazy S.O.B.

365
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:39,644
This tree was tagged by the power company
on account of it's infested with beetles.

366
00:24:39,746 --> 00:24:43,011
And I am subcontracted
to take it out.

367
00:24:43,116 --> 00:24:45,107
Funny.
You picked today to do it, huh?

368
00:24:45,218 --> 00:24:48,745
Get this tree outta here.
Clear it before I remove you.

369
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:53,315
All right, first of all, is anybody hurt?

370
00:24:53,426 --> 00:24:55,986
We're fine.
But you're just gonna let him go?

371
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:58,586
What kind of backwards
fuckin' town is this?

372
00:24:58,698 --> 00:25:00,962
This is my town, son, okay?

373
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:03,245
And I'd appreciate it if it were
treated with a little more respect...

374
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:05,948
from those that live here and from those
that are just passing through.

375
00:25:05,972 --> 00:25:09,931
Sir, will you spank me?
My father never spanked me.

376
00:25:10,043 --> 00:25:12,238
I'm in desperate need
of discipline.

377
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:16,213
You think it's a joke? Every year, four
or five of you kids get killed up here...

378
00:25:16,316 --> 00:25:19,945
driving yourselves into redwoods
or get paralyzed sucking on nitrous...

379
00:25:20,053 --> 00:25:22,851
or blow yourselves up
cooking meth.

380
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:25,014
You think you're invincible.

381
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:27,092
You're not.

382
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:30,128
Sir, I'm sorry
to make your job more difficult.

383
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:34,563
I was wondering if Methuselah
could direct us to the nearest paddy wagon.

384
00:25:36,736 --> 00:25:40,263
We'll see what kind of a goddamn jig
you can do without your fuckin' legs!

385
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:43,865
All right,
why don't you guys get outta here now.

386
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:46,912
Or do I gotta search that van and see what
kind of trail mix you got hiding in there?

387
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:48,223
Or do I gotta search that van and see what
kind of trail mix you got hiding in there?

388
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:50,215
Would you like that?

389
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:57,121
Local problems?

390
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:59,123
Nothing we can't handle.

391
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:01,674
You just take care of your
end of things, Mr. Baker.

392
00:26:01,699 --> 00:26:02,699
Oh, I will.

393
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:08,733
- Mr. Mayor.
- Call me Hal.

394
00:26:08,835 --> 00:26:12,794
Hal, that's a beautiful pin you got there.
How do I get one?

395
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:15,465
You earn it, Frank.

396
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:32,920
It's gonna be
an interesting weekend.

397
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:38,192
That water felt so good.

398
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:41,733
Mmm, water's good.

399
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:44,860
I think I'm gonna go pick some mushrooms.
You wanna come?

400
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:47,439
No, I think I'm gonna
go lay down for a little bit.

401
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,906
Okay.

402
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:52,273
- I won't be long. Okay.
- Okay.

403
00:26:58,418 --> 00:27:02,149
Hey, Mr. Rabbit.
Come here, little guy.

404
00:27:02,255 --> 00:27:05,452
Mr. Rabbit, come here.
Come here, buddy.

405
00:27:05,558 --> 00:27:07,526
What is this place?

406
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:10,528
It used to be
an old logging tunnel...

407
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,608
before these radical
environmental hippies blew it up.

408
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:15,328
When they were building
this place...

409
00:27:15,435 --> 00:27:18,563
apparently 200 Chinese workers died
when they hit a gas pocket.

410
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:22,539
And they buried 'em
in a mass grave right over there.

411
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:31,574
Mr. Rabbit?

412
00:27:34,954 --> 00:27:38,151
Don't worry, Mr. Rabbit.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

413
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:43,556
Who's that?
Is that you, Mr. Rabbit?

414
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:46,530
Ooh, chantrelles.

415
00:27:50,871 --> 00:27:53,101
Ivan, look.

416
00:27:53,207 --> 00:27:55,767
Whoa.

417
00:27:55,876 --> 00:27:58,709
It's old Deuteronomy.

418
00:27:58,812 --> 00:28:00,609
He's got a pimpin' fur coat, though.

419
00:28:00,714 --> 00:28:04,912
- Pretty sweet.
- Where's your hooptie ride?

420
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:07,816
We didn't mean to disturb you.

421
00:28:07,921 --> 00:28:12,255
I'm not disturbed.
This is not my forest.

422
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:17,058
You like some old-school hippie, like,
nature's for everybody and nobody owns it?

423
00:28:17,164 --> 00:28:18,961
Yeah, you could say that.

424
00:28:19,066 --> 00:28:22,399
But you better be careful
if you go out in these woods.

425
00:28:22,503 --> 00:28:24,903
You never know
what you're gonna find.

426
00:28:25,005 --> 00:28:28,634
- You mean, like, Bigfoot?
- No, he's not dangerous.

427
00:28:28,742 --> 00:28:33,702
It's the traps the weed growers set
is what you better watch out for.

428
00:28:33,814 --> 00:28:36,647
I told you motherfuckers.

429
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,981
- Knowledge.
- It's true.

430
00:28:40,087 --> 00:28:42,112
People disappear
all the time out here.

431
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:47,789
- What do you mean? Why?
- Because of the weed.

432
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:51,763
Locals don't like anyone
fucking with their stash.

433
00:28:54,535 --> 00:28:57,129
Hey, check it out!

434
00:28:58,772 --> 00:29:00,501
Hello!

435
00:29:00,607 --> 00:29:03,474
Come on down.
We're having an orgy.

436
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:07,411
- Bring beers.
- Dude, it's those redneck fuck holes!

437
00:29:07,514 --> 00:29:10,244
- Ow!
- Ow!

438
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:13,979
- Whoa! Whoa! Duck and cover!
- Assholes!

439
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:16,351
- Go, go, go!
- Shit!

440
00:29:16,456 --> 00:29:19,186
Tuck and roll if necessary!

441
00:29:31,705 --> 00:29:35,300
Hey, dog. Come back here, man.

442
00:29:41,481 --> 00:29:43,449
Worthless mutt!

443
00:29:47,187 --> 00:29:51,624
I thought I told you
hippies to stay out of the forest.

444
00:30:22,122 --> 00:30:24,249
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

445
00:30:24,358 --> 00:30:27,225
Hey, don't bogart all the coke,
my friends.

446
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:30,125
- I was kind of talking.
- You're always talkin'.

447
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:33,666
I was saying how happy I was
that everyone came out here.

448
00:30:33,767 --> 00:30:35,731
I know things started
off a little weird, but

449
00:30:35,756 --> 00:30:37,591
I think this trip's
gonna be a lot of fun.

450
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:39,662
- Amen to that.
- Yeah.

451
00:30:39,773 --> 00:30:41,680
Know what I think would be fun?
If someone finds

452
00:30:41,705 --> 00:30:43,353
that pot field that guy
was talking about.

453
00:30:43,377 --> 00:30:44,017
Oh, yeah.

454
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:46,022
It's the lucid moments
that cut through the haze...

455
00:30:46,046 --> 00:30:48,571
that make bringing Joey
along worthwhile.

456
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:50,684
I'm just glad that cop
didn't find my coke.

457
00:30:50,709 --> 00:30:52,938
I don't know what I would
have done without it.

458
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,183
Probably speed.
Anything to keep you from eating.

459
00:30:56,289 --> 00:30:58,249
- She's on the cokehead diet.
- Go fuck yourself!

460
00:30:58,325 --> 00:31:01,351
- Baby.
- I would if I could.

461
00:31:01,461 --> 00:31:03,588
- I'd fuck myself every day silly.
- I bet you would.

462
00:31:03,697 --> 00:31:05,597
You're nuts, Joey.

463
00:31:05,699 --> 00:31:08,611
Before you were talking about booby traps,
and now you wanna go into the weed fields?

464
00:31:08,635 --> 00:31:10,535
I can get through 'em, sir.

465
00:31:10,637 --> 00:31:13,071
I mean, bobbing and weaving
like stealth bomber style.

466
00:31:13,173 --> 00:31:15,733
Bobbing, weaving,
tucking, rolling.

467
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:20,411
Necessary.
Necessary tuck and roll.

468
00:31:20,514 --> 00:31:22,482
- Samantha?
- No, thanks.

469
00:31:22,582 --> 00:31:25,608
- Just being polite. "I" man?
- No, I'm good.

470
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:28,950
Okay, more for me.

471
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:31,388
- You've had enough!
- There's never enough! Back up.

472
00:31:31,491 --> 00:31:33,891
Come on.

473
00:31:33,994 --> 00:31:37,794
Honey-

474
00:31:42,536 --> 00:31:46,996
With that last toot, I'm gonna go
draw up some plans to find that wild ganja.

475
00:31:47,107 --> 00:31:49,803
Jah, "Rastafaria."

476
00:31:54,381 --> 00:31:57,908
You tired?
You wanna go to sleep?

477
00:31:58,018 --> 00:32:00,009
You could have had some
if you wanted.

478
00:32:02,489 --> 00:32:04,957
I want some of you.

479
00:32:11,732 --> 00:32:14,963
Give me some of that.

480
00:32:15,068 --> 00:32:17,866
I hope it doesn't get
too overwhelming.

481
00:32:17,971 --> 00:32:20,667
All those people wasted.
It sounds like it could be a nightmare.

482
00:32:20,774 --> 00:32:23,709
You gotta stop worrying, Sam.

483
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:27,439
You're just scared 'cause of
that bad trip you had with Jimmy.

484
00:32:30,317 --> 00:32:34,481
Don't be scared.
Don't be a scaredy cat.

485
00:32:37,457 --> 00:32:42,417
Anyway, you'll be straight,
and I won't do anything too mind-altering.

486
00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:45,623
I'll, like,
smoke a little weed...

487
00:32:45,732 --> 00:32:48,963
have a couple beers,
and that's it.

488
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:52,038
- All right?
- Really?

489
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:54,505
I promise.

490
00:32:56,610 --> 00:33:00,171
I got a surprise for you.
Be right back.

491
00:33:14,094 --> 00:33:16,528
Sam -

492
00:33:17,631 --> 00:33:20,395
- Was her name -

493
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,867
- And for only one brief moment -

494
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:29,135
- She fell into my lap-

495
00:33:29,242 --> 00:33:33,804
- Seems she had everything I wanted-

496
00:33:33,914 --> 00:33:36,246
- In a girl-

497
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:41,013
- She paints her nails like my guitar -

498
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:45,956
- She played it
and that was the start -

499
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:50,723
- She danced like a wicked angel -

500
00:33:50,831 --> 00:33:55,825
- She danced to the beat of my heart -

501
00:33:55,936 --> 00:33:58,427
- Whoa, oh-oh -

502
00:33:58,538 --> 00:34:00,733
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa -

503
00:34:13,253 --> 00:34:17,747
- She told me you have pretty eyes -

504
00:34:17,858 --> 00:34:22,693
- And I told her your eyes
were what I first noticed -

505
00:34:22,796 --> 00:34:27,358
Then she said that's so cheesy -

506
00:34:27,467 --> 00:34:32,234
- I told her it can't be all that cheesy -

507
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:34,239
- If it's true-

508
00:34:34,341 --> 00:34:37,708
- She didn't like my music-

509
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:53,650
Ivan! Ivan.

510
00:35:29,763 --> 00:35:31,924
Get away from me!

511
00:35:32,032 --> 00:35:34,830
Damn. I'm just
getting some crunchies.

512
00:35:38,705 --> 00:35:40,639
Did you see anybody strange around?

513
00:35:43,777 --> 00:35:46,541
Yeah, there's weirdos
all over the place.

514
00:35:57,791 --> 00:36:00,385
- He said he'd come right back.
- How long's he been gone?

515
00:36:00,493 --> 00:36:02,552
- Since yesterday around 3:00.
- Excuse me.

516
00:36:02,662 --> 00:36:05,426
Hold on. Well, if he's still missing
by the time the show's over...

517
00:36:05,532 --> 00:36:07,432
I'll send someone out
to look for him.

518
00:36:07,534 --> 00:36:10,094
My boyfriend's lost in the woods
and he won't even do anything!

519
00:36:10,203 --> 00:36:12,694
Calm down. He's probably just-

520
00:36:12,806 --> 00:36:15,900
Passed out somewhere.

521
00:36:16,009 --> 00:36:18,500
Maybe if you told me
what kind of drugs he was on-

522
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:21,409
- Fascist pig!
- What did she call me?

523
00:36:21,514 --> 00:36:24,176
Why won't you help her?
She thinks that he's lost out there.

524
00:36:24,284 --> 00:36:27,845
I don't care if she thinks Mickey Mouse
is a goddamn kitty-cat.

525
00:36:27,954 --> 00:36:30,800
I'm not going out in the woods hunting for
some hippie who got lost picking flowers.

526
00:36:30,824 --> 00:36:32,724
He's probably in one
of these tents somewhere...

527
00:36:32,826 --> 00:36:36,728
banging some other
big-bushed granola-eatin' broad.

528
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,730
How can I help you?

529
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:42,733
I think somebody's following me.

530
00:36:42,836 --> 00:36:45,566
Buzz, you there?

531
00:36:45,672 --> 00:36:47,640
I'll be right back. I promise.

532
00:36:50,043 --> 00:36:53,877
- Buzz? Buzz?
- Yeah, go for. What's up?

533
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:58,007
We need you at the
north end of the river.

534
00:36:58,118 --> 00:37:00,382
It's a bad scene, man.

535
00:37:05,692 --> 00:37:07,660
All right, let him down.

536
00:37:07,761 --> 00:37:10,457
Looks like the critters got to him.

537
00:37:10,563 --> 00:37:13,088
Mighty big critters.

538
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:16,600
I guess I'll write up a report.

539
00:37:19,105 --> 00:37:21,505
- Bring it down. Easy, easy.
- I got it.

540
00:37:21,608 --> 00:37:23,906
Looks like an accident. You think?

541
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:33,084
Well, I don't think
he did this on purpose, Cooper.

542
00:37:33,186 --> 00:37:35,154
Fuckin'-A.

543
00:37:53,406 --> 00:37:56,967
I don't see any drugs.
Watch your feet. Watch your feet.

544
00:37:58,945 --> 00:38:00,879
Where's Joey?

545
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:05,383
Come on. Come this way.
Come this way. It's a real fuckin' smash.

546
00:38:09,122 --> 00:38:13,149
Beer! Beer!

547
00:38:13,259 --> 00:38:16,786
Anyone know where
I can get some fuckin' beer?

548
00:38:16,896 --> 00:38:19,262
- Nitrous.
- Nitrous.

549
00:38:21,835 --> 00:38:24,463
- Nitrous.
- Nitrous.

550
00:38:24,571 --> 00:38:27,506
Nitrous. Nitrous.

551
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:49,858
- Damn, girl. Watch where you're going!
- Sorry.

552
00:38:49,963 --> 00:38:52,488
What's up? Where you heading?

553
00:38:57,837 --> 00:39:00,829
Weed, shrooms, acid, "X"?

554
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:03,135
Shrooms, acid, "X"?

555
00:39:17,457 --> 00:39:21,757
What the hell are you doing?

556
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:24,887
Howdy, Mayor. How's it hangin'?

557
00:39:24,998 --> 00:39:27,728
Oh, do not give me nice, Buzz.

558
00:39:27,834 --> 00:39:30,268
You just shut down half the forest.
And for what?

559
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:34,466
Because some fuzzy nudist
got himself strung up on a snare?

560
00:39:34,574 --> 00:39:38,066
No, the body was attacked.
It could have been a mountain lion, a bear.

561
00:39:38,178 --> 00:39:41,375
Or, uh, hmm, maybe it was Bigfoot.

562
00:39:44,884 --> 00:39:48,376
There is a line of vehicles
stretching two miles back...

563
00:39:48,488 --> 00:39:50,479
and they're aimed at that campsite.

564
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:54,754
And here are your instructions.
You are going to let them in.

565
00:39:54,861 --> 00:39:59,059
You are gonna see to it that they are safe
and you're gonna keep it that way!

566
00:40:03,836 --> 00:40:06,805
You, uh, want me to open the road up?

567
00:40:06,906 --> 00:40:10,967
Come on.
And listen to an elected official?

568
00:40:11,077 --> 00:40:12,977
Aren't you an elected official?

569
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,214
Just shut down the roads, Cooper.

570
00:40:16,316 --> 00:40:21,083
And, uh, make sure the park rangers
know to not let anybody else in.

571
00:40:23,256 --> 00:40:27,249
Hey, Buzz,
you think, uh, it could be...

572
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:31,056
Bigfoot, like he said?

573
00:40:31,164 --> 00:40:35,032
Not unless Bigfoot
likes black jelly beans.

574
00:40:52,418 --> 00:40:56,514
- You look funny this close.
- Don't I look funny from back there?

575
00:40:56,623 --> 00:41:00,423
You always look funny. Strange.

576
00:41:11,437 --> 00:41:13,667
Oh, shit.

577
00:41:13,773 --> 00:41:16,469
Oh, shit, I'm starting to feel it.

578
00:41:16,576 --> 00:41:18,703
Samantha's gonna freak
if she finds out.

579
00:41:18,811 --> 00:41:21,405
It's no big deal.
You only took a half a hit of ecstasy.

580
00:41:21,514 --> 00:41:24,574
- It's not like you're shooting "H. '"
- I know.

581
00:41:24,684 --> 00:41:26,948
It's a big deal to her, though.

582
00:41:29,756 --> 00:41:31,656
She's gonna fuckin' know.

583
00:41:31,758 --> 00:41:34,921
Don't worry, sweetie.
You know she loves you.

584
00:41:36,062 --> 00:41:38,587
Really?

585
00:41:38,698 --> 00:41:40,666
Does she?

586
00:41:51,144 --> 00:41:53,112
Joey?

587
00:41:56,015 --> 00:41:58,506
- Whoa!
- Sorry.

588
00:41:58,618 --> 00:42:02,110
Uh, have you guys seen
Linda and Joey around?

589
00:42:02,221 --> 00:42:05,452
Uh, Linda isn't in here, honey,
and, uh, we're gonna be a while.

590
00:42:05,558 --> 00:42:07,458
Don't you know the golden rule?

591
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,961
I f the van is a-rockin',
don't come a-cock blockin'.

592
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:26,940
Do I look fucked up?

593
00:42:27,046 --> 00:42:29,947
- Yes.
- How do you feel?

594
00:42:30,049 --> 00:42:31,880
Well, I feel great.

595
00:42:31,984 --> 00:42:35,317
That's all that matters.

596
00:42:35,421 --> 00:42:37,446
- Linda?
- Samantha.

597
00:42:40,193 --> 00:42:42,184
I didn't know where you-

598
00:42:43,696 --> 00:42:45,596
Linda, can I talk to you
for a second?

599
00:42:45,698 --> 00:42:47,666
Sure, sweetie.

600
00:42:57,443 --> 00:42:59,968
Fuckin' amateur.

601
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,274
Look at you.

602
00:43:03,616 --> 00:43:05,516
That's beautiful.

603
00:43:05,618 --> 00:43:08,314
- I saw his car and I saw a cigarette butt-
- Jimmy's not here.

604
00:43:08,421 --> 00:43:12,289
- Yes, he is here.
- No, no, baby, baby, he's not here.

605
00:43:12,392 --> 00:43:14,690
Believe me, he's gone.
He won't get you.

606
00:43:14,794 --> 00:43:16,989
Okay?

607
00:43:17,096 --> 00:43:18,996
Linda!

608
00:43:21,868 --> 00:43:24,029
Linda! Linda!

609
00:43:25,538 --> 00:43:27,904
Come here.
I've got something to show you.

610
00:43:28,007 --> 00:43:31,773
Oh, I wonder what that could be.

611
00:43:35,248 --> 00:43:39,878
- Wait for me.
- But they said not to go into the woods.

612
00:43:52,999 --> 00:43:55,695
Quiet down, Jesus!

613
00:43:55,802 --> 00:43:58,669
Afternoon, Officer.
What can I do for you?

614
00:43:58,771 --> 00:44:01,797
I was, uh, hoping
we might have a word.

615
00:44:01,908 --> 00:44:04,433
There's been some trouble
I need to talk to you about.

616
00:44:04,544 --> 00:44:07,411
You're not shittin'?

617
00:44:07,513 --> 00:44:11,381
No, sir, I am not.
Festival grounds, north side of the river.

618
00:44:11,484 --> 00:44:15,818
A flower child stepped in a snare
and got strung up in a tree.

619
00:44:15,922 --> 00:44:19,085
Now, you wouldn't have any idea
who set that trap, would you?

620
00:44:20,893 --> 00:44:23,361
You got a search warrant, Buzz?

621
00:44:23,463 --> 00:44:26,125
No, sir, I do not.
But I can go get one.

622
00:44:26,232 --> 00:44:29,759
I've been meaning to see what kind of crops
you got growing back there anyway.

623
00:44:45,318 --> 00:44:47,809
I don't think
you understand, Buzz.

624
00:44:49,655 --> 00:44:54,524
I don't hate 'em because they came here
for some goddamn concert.

625
00:44:54,627 --> 00:44:59,291
No, I hate 'em because they ruined my life.

626
00:44:59,398 --> 00:45:02,697
They made it
so people think that...

627
00:45:02,802 --> 00:45:06,704
a goddamn tree is more important
than a human being.

628
00:45:06,806 --> 00:45:09,297
And they took my wife.

629
00:45:11,811 --> 00:45:13,779
And they took my boy.

630
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:17,008
I understand that.

631
00:45:17,116 --> 00:45:20,643
It's just I got a...
dead body on my hands.

632
00:45:20,753 --> 00:45:23,483
And I don't need another one.

633
00:45:23,589 --> 00:45:25,523
Well, I didn't kill anybody.

634
00:45:25,625 --> 00:45:29,186
I'm not saying you did,
but... I'm thinking, Dylan...

635
00:45:29,295 --> 00:45:32,615
that I'm gonna have to lock you up for a
little while, just till the concert's over.

636
00:45:32,665 --> 00:45:35,327
Now, it's for your own good.

637
00:45:35,434 --> 00:45:37,334
Uh, or I-

638
00:45:37,436 --> 00:45:40,599
You could show me
where the rest of those traps are.

639
00:45:41,908 --> 00:45:44,069
Well, I guess I could do that.

640
00:45:44,176 --> 00:45:47,441
But I still think
you authority types...

641
00:45:47,547 --> 00:45:50,675
are protectin' the wrong people.

642
00:45:50,783 --> 00:45:55,015
The government's got laws
that help corporations...

643
00:45:55,121 --> 00:45:57,817
and activists.

644
00:45:57,924 --> 00:46:00,164
Yeah, but who's out there
looking out for the little man?

645
00:46:00,192 --> 00:46:02,524
Huh?

646
00:46:02,628 --> 00:46:08,089
Well, some people say that the government's
looking out for the greater good.

647
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:11,431
Yeah? Well, that depends
who's in charge of the government.

648
00:46:11,537 --> 00:46:13,471
You know...

649
00:46:13,573 --> 00:46:16,041
Ronnie Reagan,
God rest his soul...

650
00:46:16,142 --> 00:46:18,736
he had a theory
about jelly beans.

651
00:46:18,844 --> 00:46:23,508
Yes, sir. He would keep
a big bowl of them on his table.

652
00:46:23,616 --> 00:46:26,016
And he'd watch people
when they took some.

653
00:46:26,118 --> 00:46:28,109
What would he watch for?

654
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,188
Well, he said
there were two types.

655
00:46:30,289 --> 00:46:35,352
Those who reached in and grabbed a handful
willy-nilly and didn't care what they got...

656
00:46:35,461 --> 00:46:39,898
and those who went in
with an agenda.

657
00:46:39,999 --> 00:46:43,594
Those who were-how do you say-

658
00:46:43,703 --> 00:46:47,298
more... tactical.

659
00:46:51,577 --> 00:46:54,478
You, uh...

660
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:57,549
show Cooper the rest
of them traps, all right?

661
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:01,586
Stick around this weekend.
It'll be over before you know it.

662
00:47:01,687 --> 00:47:03,814
Much obliged, Sheriff.

663
00:47:05,491 --> 00:47:07,459
Cooper, Cooper.

664
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:11,621
Coop, you there, buddy?

665
00:47:11,731 --> 00:47:13,699
Coop?

666
00:47:21,407 --> 00:47:22,357
Go for Cooper.

667
00:47:22,382 --> 00:47:25,231
I need you to come up
here to Ruby Ridge...

668
00:47:25,311 --> 00:47:28,712
and collect some of Dylan's
hippie traps, and keep an eye out too.

669
00:47:28,814 --> 00:47:32,477
I don't think he's gonna show
you where all of 'em are.

670
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,789
I'm gonna get you.

671
00:47:48,701 --> 00:47:52,193
You're gonna get it.

672
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,287
That's what I'm talkin' about.

673
00:47:55,312 --> 00:47:57,556
Shit, if there was a trap,
I'd go, "Hell, yeah."

674
00:47:57,643 --> 00:48:00,158
Oh, bud, you're scared of
titties if they're too big.

675
00:48:00,183 --> 00:48:01,626
Yeah. Your mama's titties.

676
00:48:01,714 --> 00:48:06,378
My mom has good tits.
You gotta admit that.

677
00:48:06,485 --> 00:48:09,545
She does.

678
00:48:09,655 --> 00:48:12,249
What do you say we play a little
hippie-hippie-bang-bang?

679
00:48:20,399 --> 00:48:22,424
Linda!

680
00:48:23,769 --> 00:48:27,796
Linda! Come here, girl.

681
00:48:30,142 --> 00:48:32,610
Kitty, kitty. Here, kitty.

682
00:48:32,712 --> 00:48:37,149
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty-
Pussy! Pussy, pussy.

683
00:48:37,249 --> 00:48:40,582
Come on, Linda!
Come on! Pussy! Good pussy!

684
00:48:40,686 --> 00:48:42,654
Joey?

685
00:48:43,923 --> 00:48:45,982
Joey, I'm here.

686
00:48:48,527 --> 00:48:50,654
Joey!

687
00:48:50,763 --> 00:48:53,288
Joey, I'm here!

688
00:48:53,399 --> 00:48:55,299
Joey.

689
00:48:55,401 --> 00:49:00,338
Joey? Quit screwin' around.

690
00:49:02,074 --> 00:49:04,042
Joey?

691
00:49:06,712 --> 00:49:08,680
Joey?

692
00:49:30,136 --> 00:49:33,105
I think we just found
the Garden of Eden!

693
00:49:49,488 --> 00:49:53,083
You have just found
a weapon of mass destruction.

694
00:49:53,192 --> 00:49:56,684
- Shut up.
- Okay, I can do that.

695
00:49:59,765 --> 00:50:02,199
Oh, just like that.

696
00:50:02,301 --> 00:50:04,667
- Ow! Fuck, I'm shot!
- What?

697
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:07,034
- Fuck!
- Oh, fuck!

698
00:50:07,139 --> 00:50:10,370
Oh! I'm fuckin' bleeding!

699
00:50:10,476 --> 00:50:13,570
What the fuck!

700
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:16,671
- Come on!
- Motherfucker!

701
00:50:17,817 --> 00:50:19,011
It's paint!

702
00:50:19,118 --> 00:50:22,212
They're shooting paint balls at us!

703
00:50:25,191 --> 00:50:28,592
Baby white boy was gettin'
his penis sucked on.

704
00:50:28,694 --> 00:50:31,254
- Let's go get a closer look.
- Shh!

705
00:50:37,403 --> 00:50:40,861
Damn it! Hank!

706
00:50:40,973 --> 00:50:43,203
I dropped my paint balls.

707
00:50:50,249 --> 00:50:52,183
Where in the fuck are they?

708
00:50:52,284 --> 00:50:54,184
They're not fucking here.

709
00:50:54,286 --> 00:50:56,584
No shit, Sherlock.

710
00:50:56,689 --> 00:50:59,249
Somebody's wantin' to play games.

711
00:51:01,794 --> 00:51:04,456
Playin' a little hide-and-seek
with the big bad wolf.

712
00:51:04,563 --> 00:51:06,724
Got you, bitch!

713
00:51:06,832 --> 00:51:10,268
- Fuckin'-
- Get this freak off me!

714
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:16,473
I said come on, motherfucker!

715
00:51:19,745 --> 00:51:22,111
Oh, fuck!

716
00:51:22,214 --> 00:51:24,910
Hurts, don't it?

717
00:52:01,387 --> 00:52:05,687
What the fuck's your problem, man?

718
00:52:33,887 --> 00:52:36,515
Come back, girl!

719
00:52:36,623 --> 00:52:38,989
I'm not gonna hurt ya.
I just wanna talk.

720
00:52:46,599 --> 00:52:48,533
Shit!

721
00:52:48,635 --> 00:52:52,036
Holy fuckin' shit! Help me!

722
00:52:52,138 --> 00:52:54,003
My leg! Oh, fuck!

723
00:52:54,107 --> 00:52:56,098
Please help!

724
00:52:56,209 --> 00:52:58,575
Bears! Oh, bear trap!
Fuckin' help!

725
00:52:58,678 --> 00:53:01,374
Oh, fuck! Please help!

726
00:54:18,558 --> 00:54:20,458
Well, Nancy...

727
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:25,725
you know young people today.

728
00:54:25,832 --> 00:54:28,232
No respect for anything.

729
00:54:38,314 --> 00:54:42,478
Nancy!

730
00:54:58,501 --> 00:55:00,526
What are you doin'?

731
00:55:00,636 --> 00:55:02,695
Get out of here!

732
00:55:02,805 --> 00:55:06,434
Come on. Bag huffer. Come on.

733
00:55:06,542 --> 00:55:08,510
Come on, ass sucker.

734
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:15,214
Busted! Here you go.
Put your hands out. Put your hands out.

735
00:55:15,318 --> 00:55:20,085
Fuck! I am startin'
to come down, though.

736
00:55:20,189 --> 00:55:22,623
Maybe I didn't take enough.

737
00:55:22,725 --> 00:55:26,388
Dude, quit bein' such a bitch.
Take some more. This is good shit.

738
00:55:26,496 --> 00:55:29,624
It's not speedy at all.
Nice and clean. Make you feel very cozy.

739
00:55:29,732 --> 00:55:32,132
I don't know.

740
00:55:32,235 --> 00:55:34,931
Do we have anything to drink?

741
00:55:35,037 --> 00:55:37,005
No. Come on, dude.
Just have some fun.

742
00:55:37,106 --> 00:55:40,098
Finally. Just swallow.

743
00:55:40,209 --> 00:55:43,667
Ivan.

744
00:55:43,779 --> 00:55:45,337
- Sam.
- Hey.

745
00:55:45,448 --> 00:55:48,440
Hi. I'm happy to see you.

746
00:55:50,987 --> 00:55:52,784
Where's Linda and Joey?

747
00:55:52,889 --> 00:55:56,347
I don't know. Maybe they're-
They're probably in there already.

748
00:55:56,459 --> 00:55:59,292
- Look, it's Abe Lincoln.
- Aye, aye, sir!

749
00:56:10,406 --> 00:56:13,068
Whoo-hoo! Funky town!

750
00:56:15,244 --> 00:56:17,144
What's wrong? Come on.

751
00:56:17,246 --> 00:56:21,182
Is it... starting to rain?

752
00:56:32,228 --> 00:56:34,992
Make some room!
Step back, step back.

753
00:56:35,097 --> 00:56:38,589
Step-Step out. Oh, my God.

754
00:56:40,736 --> 00:56:44,502
All right, I need everybody
on this end to please exit the premises.

755
00:56:44,607 --> 00:56:47,770
All right? I need that gate opened,
and I need you guys to move that way!

756
00:56:47,877 --> 00:56:50,675
Please! Come on!
Fellas, let's go.

757
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:52,441
Jesus Christ!

758
00:56:52,548 --> 00:56:55,745
Uh, Cooper, I need you to get over here
to the campground immediately.

759
00:56:55,851 --> 00:56:58,877
And I need a body bag. Guys, what
are you doin' waitin' around here?

760
00:56:58,988 --> 00:57:03,425
That's the door!
Let's go! Party is over!

761
00:57:04,709 --> 00:57:08,180
Let's go, guys. Come on.
Move it out. Please.

762
00:57:08,264 --> 00:57:12,496
Come on. Move out.
Watch out for the cars.

763
00:57:12,602 --> 00:57:14,661
- Guys, please, let's move out.
- Major bummer, man.

764
00:57:14,770 --> 00:57:17,136
The party's that way.
The party's that way.

765
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:20,676
I know I said shut it down,
but I need that highway back open.

766
00:57:20,776 --> 00:57:22,835
Please, sir, that's a fire hazard.

767
00:57:22,945 --> 00:57:25,846
Please, put out the, um,
the fire on your head there.

768
00:57:25,948 --> 00:57:30,146
I know. I know, guys. I'm sorry for the
inconvenience. There's always Burning Man.

769
00:57:30,253 --> 00:57:33,450
- There's no makin' love in the woods!
- Sheriff!

770
00:57:33,556 --> 00:57:35,956
Get your clothes on! No!

771
00:57:36,058 --> 00:57:38,704
Sheriff, what in the goddamn
name of Judas do you think you're doin'?

772
00:57:38,728 --> 00:57:41,595
- Shuttin' you down, Frank Baker.
- Fuck you.

773
00:57:41,697 --> 00:57:44,689
Frank, I got two dead bodies out there
and a killer on the loose.

774
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,995
Okay? Thanks for
the wonderful party, pal.

775
00:57:47,103 --> 00:57:50,869
But I got a job to do, all right? So please,
pack your shit and get out of here!

776
00:57:50,973 --> 00:57:54,409
Fuck you!
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you!

777
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:57,479
- Yeah, fuck me.
- Buzz kill.

778
00:57:57,580 --> 00:58:00,947
- Real nice language, by the way.
- Fuck you!

779
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:03,883
Let's go, guys.
Bird! Bird! Bird, please!

780
00:58:03,986 --> 00:58:08,355
Bird man! Hey! Hey! Come on!
Show's over, guys.

781
00:58:08,457 --> 00:58:11,324
Get out of the costume.
Go! Move it!

782
00:58:12,795 --> 00:58:14,922
- Jesus Christ.
- Fuck you!

783
00:58:15,031 --> 00:58:18,933
No refunds! Get out of my fuckin' way,
you fuckin' dumb ass!

784
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:50,396
Party!

785
00:58:52,535 --> 00:58:54,196
Get naked!

786
00:58:56,806 --> 00:58:59,297
Take clothes off!

787
00:59:45,287 --> 00:59:48,313
Rock it, George, man! Party!

788
00:59:48,424 --> 00:59:50,585
- Party!
- Party!

789
00:59:50,693 --> 00:59:52,422
- Party!
- Party!

790
00:59:52,528 --> 00:59:55,497
Party!

791
00:59:55,598 --> 00:59:58,863
Shut it down!

792
01:00:01,437 --> 01:00:03,302
I mean it!

793
01:00:03,406 --> 01:00:06,068
Maybe you've heard
and maybe you haven't...

794
01:00:06,175 --> 01:00:08,700
but there's been an incident
here tonight.

795
01:00:08,811 --> 01:00:13,771
And I have lawfully ordered everyone
to vacate these premises a long time ago!

796
01:00:16,652 --> 01:00:18,847
Right now, I am authorized-

797
01:00:18,954 --> 01:00:21,889
If you won't leave,
I am authorized...

798
01:00:21,991 --> 01:00:24,789
to call in any law enforcement agency
I deem necessary...

799
01:00:24,894 --> 01:00:26,794
to have you forcibly removed.

800
01:00:26,896 --> 01:00:28,989
That includes
the National Guard, people.

801
01:00:29,098 --> 01:00:33,660
You will be arrested! Go home!

802
01:00:33,769 --> 01:00:36,203
The show is over!

803
01:00:36,305 --> 01:00:38,535
Leave, people!

804
01:00:38,641 --> 01:00:40,541
And you, put your shirt on!

805
01:00:40,643 --> 01:00:43,271
- Put your shirt on! Put your shirt on!
- No!

806
01:00:43,379 --> 01:00:45,813
You think this is a joke?
It's not!

807
01:00:45,915 --> 01:00:49,180
If you don't leave,
you will die!

808
01:00:57,326 --> 01:00:59,886
Your sheriff thinks we have
a security problem, fine.

809
01:00:59,995 --> 01:01:02,520
Let him send in
the National Guard.

810
01:01:02,631 --> 01:01:05,156
Let him send in the motherfuckin'
marines for all I care.

811
01:01:05,267 --> 01:01:07,462
Let me remind you
of one thing, Mr. Mayor.

812
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:09,470
We have a contract...

813
01:01:09,572 --> 01:01:12,040
the cornerstone of
the American capitalist foundation!

814
01:01:12,141 --> 01:01:14,371
You see, that's just the thing,
uh, Mr. Baker.

815
01:01:14,477 --> 01:01:16,377
We do have a contract...

816
01:01:16,479 --> 01:01:19,414
- Uh-huh. Fuck you.
- And, uh...

817
01:01:19,515 --> 01:01:21,415
Let's just see what it says here.

818
01:01:21,517 --> 01:01:24,179
- Uh, you are to provide a concert.
- Uh-huh.

819
01:01:24,286 --> 01:01:26,754
Fuck you, Hal.

820
01:01:26,856 --> 01:01:28,756
- And revenues owed this town...
- Uh-huh.

821
01:01:28,858 --> 01:01:31,224
- By, uh, receipts from said concert...
- Uh-huh.

822
01:01:31,327 --> 01:01:34,694
- Fuck you. Uh-huh. Fuck you.
- Or out of your own pocket.

823
01:01:34,797 --> 01:01:36,697
Uh-huh. Fuck you!

824
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:37,749
Excuse me?

825
01:01:37,774 --> 01:01:40,623
No, I was talking to
somebody in the other room.

826
01:01:40,703 --> 01:01:42,261
Uh-Uh-huh.

827
01:01:42,371 --> 01:01:44,635
Well-

828
01:01:47,643 --> 01:01:51,773
Well, you seem really busy.
Let me let you run, okay?

829
01:01:54,183 --> 01:01:56,879
Where the fuck
do you think you're going?

830
01:01:56,986 --> 01:02:00,444
Pig said that the show was over.

831
01:02:00,556 --> 01:02:02,751
- So it's over. The show is over.
- No!

832
01:02:02,858 --> 01:02:05,088
No! The show is not over!

833
01:02:05,194 --> 01:02:08,590
So unpack your gear and get
the fuck back out there!

834
01:02:08,615 --> 01:02:09,746
Say what?

835
01:02:09,832 --> 01:02:12,596
There's a lot of people out there
who came expecting to see a show...

836
01:02:12,701 --> 01:02:15,761
and I'll be goddamned if some
hick cop's gonna shut me down!

837
01:02:15,871 --> 01:02:18,738
Well, what do you want us
to sing, Frank? "Taps"?

838
01:02:18,841 --> 01:02:22,368
Yeah. I don't give a fuck
if you sing motherfuckin' "Kumbaya."

839
01:02:22,478 --> 01:02:25,072
Just get the fuck out there.
We have a contract...

840
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:27,080
by the grace of
George fucking Washington...

841
01:02:27,182 --> 01:02:31,050
you motherfuckin' fucking fucks!

842
01:02:31,153 --> 01:02:33,121
Capisce?

843
01:02:34,790 --> 01:02:37,122
Hey!

844
01:02:52,207 --> 01:02:54,107
You wanna keep it alive?

845
01:02:59,481 --> 01:03:01,244
Meet us in the forest, man!

846
01:03:03,552 --> 01:03:05,952
- I n our forest!
- Fuck yeah!

847
01:03:06,055 --> 01:03:08,319
God's forest!

848
01:03:08,424 --> 01:03:11,222
Yeah!

849
01:03:12,361 --> 01:03:14,556
Where's my fucking phone?

850
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:21,258
Hey, it's mellow, you guys.
I talked to 'em. Everything's cool.

851
01:03:21,370 --> 01:03:23,304
What did they say?

852
01:03:23,405 --> 01:03:26,101
They said it's gonna take hours
to even get to the highway...

853
01:03:26,208 --> 01:03:30,975
not to mention Joey's got the keys,
and who knows where the fuck he is.

854
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:32,672
You didn't see him
at the concert?

855
01:03:32,781 --> 01:03:35,045
- No. Linda either.
- We have to go find them.

856
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:39,348
Fuck that. I'm not goin' out there
with Chuck Manson on the loose.

857
01:03:39,455 --> 01:03:44,518
- Dude, we can't just sit here.
- It's cool, honey. They'll come back.

858
01:03:44,627 --> 01:03:49,360
No, it's not cool.
We have to do something.

859
01:03:49,465 --> 01:03:52,923
If you wanna do something, you should
try the ecstasy. I highly recommend it.

860
01:03:55,371 --> 01:03:58,135
Sam, just come over here
and sit down next to me.

861
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,834
I don't wanna sit down,
and I don't wanna run away from reality.

862
01:04:00,943 --> 01:04:02,843
I just want to get out of here!

863
01:04:02,945 --> 01:04:06,711
I'll run from reality
screaming gladly.

864
01:04:09,351 --> 01:04:12,013
Plus, this dude said
the party's not over, not officially.

865
01:04:12,121 --> 01:04:14,021
What are you talkin' about?

866
01:04:14,123 --> 01:04:16,801
Some guys are thinkin' about
goin' in the woods, startin' a drum circle.

867
01:04:16,825 --> 01:04:18,725
Here, babe.

868
01:04:18,827 --> 01:04:21,728
You're stuck in bumblefuck,
you might as well party in bumblefuck.

869
01:04:21,830 --> 01:04:23,730
Are you insane?

870
01:04:23,832 --> 01:04:28,792
We're all insane, honey.

871
01:04:33,342 --> 01:04:36,402
- Dude, what is your girlfriend's problem?
- My problem?

872
01:04:36,512 --> 01:04:39,640
In case you haven't noticed,
people are dying around here.

873
01:04:39,748 --> 01:04:41,943
Well, where are we
gonna go, honey?

874
01:04:42,051 --> 01:04:44,349
Anywhere. Fuck!

875
01:04:44,453 --> 01:04:46,648
Look. Without Joey
and without Linda?

876
01:04:46,755 --> 01:04:49,019
Come on. Just come here.

877
01:04:49,124 --> 01:04:52,321
Let's just be together.
Everything's gonna be all right.

878
01:04:52,428 --> 01:04:55,397
And we'll go find...

879
01:04:55,497 --> 01:04:59,399
Joey and Linda... at the party.

880
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:03,138
What?

881
01:05:07,009 --> 01:05:08,909
What?

882
01:05:09,011 --> 01:05:11,138
You're fucked up too.

883
01:05:11,246 --> 01:05:13,680
I'm not fucked up.

884
01:05:13,782 --> 01:05:17,183
I'm just-
I'm just a little... fucked up.

885
01:05:17,286 --> 01:05:19,777
Come on, babe.
Where are you going?

886
01:05:19,888 --> 01:05:22,982
Sam.

887
01:05:23,092 --> 01:05:26,186
Come on, Sam. Don't-

888
01:05:53,388 --> 01:05:57,347
Fuck!

889
01:05:59,428 --> 01:06:01,396
W-W-W-Whoa!

890
01:06:03,699 --> 01:06:06,031
You leave me alone!

891
01:06:08,003 --> 01:06:10,301
Fuck!

892
01:06:15,677 --> 01:06:19,204
Ivan!

893
01:06:19,381 --> 01:06:21,474
The goddamn problem is...

894
01:06:21,583 --> 01:06:25,212
people just don't seem
to respect authority anymore.

895
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,880
Well, I respect you, Buzz.

896
01:06:27,990 --> 01:06:30,390
That's not exactly what I meant.

897
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:45,573
Old Man Riggs.
My pops always said he was crazy.

898
01:06:45,674 --> 01:06:48,302
I never thought he'd end up
killin' people though.

899
01:06:48,410 --> 01:06:50,503
Yeah, he's a regular
goddamn Greek tragedy.

900
01:07:18,674 --> 01:07:21,199
Wait, wait.

901
01:07:24,012 --> 01:07:25,912
Clear.

902
01:07:39,995 --> 01:07:42,486
Some people just like
jelly beans, pal.

903
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:47,660
- Get him off!
- I'm tryin'! I'm tryin'!

904
01:07:47,769 --> 01:07:50,795
- Get him off me!
- Get out of the way, Buzz!

905
01:07:50,906 --> 01:07:53,306
- Get him off!
- I can't!

906
01:07:53,408 --> 01:07:56,104
I can't shoot a dog!

907
01:07:56,211 --> 01:08:00,011
- Shoot him!
- No, Buzz! Shake him!

908
01:08:03,385 --> 01:08:05,910
Get off of me!

909
01:08:11,226 --> 01:08:14,491
- You're nice.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

910
01:08:14,596 --> 01:08:18,430
Shh!

911
01:08:43,825 --> 01:08:45,918
Dylan Riggs!

912
01:08:46,028 --> 01:08:50,226
Turn off the saw
and put your hands in the air!

913
01:08:50,332 --> 01:08:52,664
You ain't gonna take
my boy again!

914
01:08:53,969 --> 01:08:55,630
You're under arrest!

915
01:09:05,013 --> 01:09:07,345
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

916
01:09:07,449 --> 01:09:09,542
Go get him!

917
01:09:09,651 --> 01:09:12,176
Hang in there!

918
01:09:16,825 --> 01:09:19,589
Ivan!

919
01:09:19,695 --> 01:09:22,721
Jack? Jade?

920
01:09:34,876 --> 01:09:37,868
No!

921
01:09:39,781 --> 01:09:43,217
- Samantha?
- Ivan!

922
01:09:43,318 --> 01:09:46,947
Jack and Jade, they're-

923
01:09:51,093 --> 01:09:53,561
What's wrong with
your friend, Samantha?

924
01:09:53,662 --> 01:09:55,892
He seems pretty fucked up to me.
What do you think?

925
01:09:55,998 --> 01:09:58,694
You fuckin' asshole!

926
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,566
I thought hippies were supposed
to be nice little kooks.

927
01:10:02,671 --> 01:10:04,571
He didn't seem that happy to see me,
not at all.

928
01:10:04,673 --> 01:10:06,868
How could you?

929
01:10:06,975 --> 01:10:09,637
- I love you, Sam!
- I hate you! You're sick!

930
01:10:09,745 --> 01:10:13,647
- I fuckin' hate you!
- How could you say that?

931
01:10:13,749 --> 01:10:15,979
Let him go!

932
01:10:16,084 --> 01:10:18,143
Should I let you go,
you little bitch?

933
01:10:18,253 --> 01:10:21,154
- I'm not gonna do-
- You're not gonna nothin'!

934
01:10:23,692 --> 01:10:26,388
How could you pick
this piece of shit over me?

935
01:10:26,495 --> 01:10:28,486
How could you leave me
for this piece of shit?

936
01:10:28,597 --> 01:10:30,792
You're fucking crazy, Jimmy!

937
01:10:30,899 --> 01:10:35,097
How could you kill my friends?
You're a monster!

938
01:10:35,203 --> 01:10:37,831
What?

939
01:10:37,939 --> 01:10:40,669
What are you talking about?
I didn't touch your friends!

940
01:10:40,776 --> 01:10:43,142
He killed Jack and Jade.

941
01:10:44,346 --> 01:10:46,246
What?

942
01:10:46,348 --> 01:10:49,511
I didn't-
I didn't fuckin' kill anybody!

943
01:10:49,618 --> 01:10:51,848
What makes you think
I could kill somebody?

944
01:10:51,953 --> 01:10:53,853
Because you have a gun!

945
01:10:57,793 --> 01:11:00,785
All right. What can I say?

946
01:11:00,896 --> 01:11:03,160
I'm a big fan of Charlton Heston.

947
01:11:10,872 --> 01:11:13,272
But I'm a Republican!

948
01:11:16,611 --> 01:11:19,705
Sam, get out of here!

949
01:11:23,785 --> 01:11:25,844
Get the hell out of here!
Get out of here!

950
01:11:25,954 --> 01:11:28,514
Ivan!

951
01:11:28,623 --> 01:11:30,147
Sam, go!

952
01:11:36,898 --> 01:11:39,958
Well, there you go again.

953
01:12:40,061 --> 01:12:42,962
Hank? Linda? Joey?

954
01:12:43,064 --> 01:12:46,966
Somebody, please!

955
01:12:47,068 --> 01:12:49,730
Help! Help! Somebody help me!

956
01:13:03,218 --> 01:13:05,209
What-What was that?

957
01:13:07,422 --> 01:13:09,322
Acid.

958
01:13:11,426 --> 01:13:14,793
No! No! No!

959
01:13:14,896 --> 01:13:17,888
No! No!

960
01:14:26,301 --> 01:14:28,201
Truly improving.

961
01:14:37,746 --> 01:14:39,646
Ronnie?

962
01:14:39,748 --> 01:14:43,377
One, two, three, four!

963
01:16:07,936 --> 01:16:09,836
Jesus.

964
01:16:44,272 --> 01:16:47,435
California Department of Health Services...

965
01:16:47,542 --> 01:16:51,205
prepared for the release
of thousands of mental patients...

966
01:16:51,312 --> 01:16:54,509
many of them
violent extremists...

967
01:16:54,616 --> 01:16:58,211
as new cuts to the state budget
are due to take effect.

968
01:16:58,319 --> 01:17:01,880
Critics of the plan
blame Governor Ronald Reagan...

969
01:17:01,990 --> 01:17:04,618
for slashing the funds
to mental health board rates...

970
01:17:04,726 --> 01:17:08,628
the latest in a line of sweeping budgetary
changes-

971
01:17:08,730 --> 01:17:13,224
The actor turned conservative Republican
took office last January.

972
01:17:26,181 --> 01:17:29,912
Shh!

973
01:17:30,018 --> 01:17:32,179
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!

974
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:34,653
Oh, my God.

975
01:17:34,756 --> 01:17:37,816
Jesus. Take it easy.
It's okay. It's okay.

976
01:17:37,926 --> 01:17:41,225
Hey, hey, hey! It's okay.
No one's gonna hurt you anymore.

977
01:17:41,329 --> 01:17:44,992
- Give me your hands.
- You can't stop him.

978
01:17:45,099 --> 01:17:47,863
You can't stop him. It's R-

979
01:17:47,969 --> 01:17:49,561
It's Reagan.

980
01:17:49,671 --> 01:17:51,935
Calm down.
No one's gonna hurt you anymore.

981
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:53,940
It's all under control.

982
01:17:54,042 --> 01:17:56,510
It'll be all right.

983
01:17:58,313 --> 01:18:00,975
- You're okay.
- It's Reagan. It's Reagan.

984
01:18:01,082 --> 01:18:04,518
No one's gonna hurt you no more.

985
01:18:08,656 --> 01:18:10,283
Shh!

986
01:18:17,165 --> 01:18:20,532
How about we start collecting
some money from these bozos?

987
01:18:20,635 --> 01:18:22,626
This ain't supposed to be free.

988
01:18:22,737 --> 01:18:25,297
Nothin' in this world is free!

989
01:19:34,075 --> 01:19:37,442
Ronald Reagan!

990
01:19:37,545 --> 01:19:41,447
- Coop, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Did you get him?

991
01:19:41,549 --> 01:19:45,349
Dylan's dead.
But he's just the cleanup man.

992
01:19:45,453 --> 01:19:47,387
Look, I need an ambulance.

993
01:19:47,488 --> 01:19:50,616
And get me the park rangers.
Have 'em meet me by the campsite.

994
01:19:50,725 --> 01:19:53,717
This is a manhunt now...

995
01:19:53,828 --> 01:19:55,557
and Gus Riggs is our man.

996
01:19:55,663 --> 01:19:57,563
Dylan's kid?

997
01:19:57,665 --> 01:20:02,159
I thought they locked him up years ago.

998
01:20:09,911 --> 01:20:14,712
Yeah, well, it looks like Reagan released
him and about a thousand other maniacs.

999
01:20:14,816 --> 01:20:17,649
So lucky for us, he's back.

1000
01:20:17,752 --> 01:20:19,830
Who do you think he's after?

1001
01:20:19,854 --> 01:20:22,982
Hippies.

1002
01:21:08,577 --> 01:21:11,910
Nice puppies! Nice! Nice puppies! Nice!

1003
01:21:15,107 --> 01:21:17,598
Nice puppies!

1004
01:21:22,013 --> 01:21:26,279
Yeah. You okay? Buzz?

1005
01:21:26,384 --> 01:21:29,148
Cooper, I'm heading to Dylan's farm!

1006
01:21:29,254 --> 01:21:32,348
And, no, I am not okay!

1007
01:21:51,109 --> 01:21:53,600
Linda?

1008
01:21:55,347 --> 01:21:57,178
Linda?

1009
01:22:02,053 --> 01:22:06,149
- It's gonna be okay, sweetie.
- I'm so happy to see you.

1010
01:22:06,258 --> 01:22:09,489
I've missed you.

1011
01:22:10,762 --> 01:22:14,163
Can we go home now?

1012
01:22:42,928 --> 01:22:47,058
Now, Patti...

1013
01:22:47,165 --> 01:22:49,224
you see what happens...

1014
01:22:49,334 --> 01:22:52,030
when you hang out
with the wrong crowd?

1015
01:22:58,243 --> 01:23:03,510
No daughter of mine
is gonna be hooked on drugs.

1016
01:23:06,051 --> 01:23:08,781
You're gonna break
your mother's heart.

1017
01:23:12,123 --> 01:23:15,854
You're gonna break
your mother's heart.

1018
01:23:27,305 --> 01:23:30,069
Nancy?

1019
01:23:30,175 --> 01:23:32,439
Poindexter? Meese?

1020
01:23:46,424 --> 01:23:51,293
It's morning in America...

1021
01:23:51,396 --> 01:23:53,796
all over again!

1022
01:23:53,899 --> 01:23:56,959
Gus Riggs,
don't move a goddamn muscle!

1023
01:24:07,112 --> 01:24:09,774
Is this what you call
compassion and conservatism, boy?

1024
01:24:19,658 --> 01:24:22,092
Miss, you okay?

1025
01:24:24,262 --> 01:24:25,957
You hurt?

1026
01:24:26,064 --> 01:24:28,430
Cooper, you still standin', buddy?

1027
01:24:28,533 --> 01:24:30,797
I'm here, Buzzo.

1028
01:24:33,939 --> 01:24:38,035
What was that?

1029
01:24:44,049 --> 01:24:46,176
- Good! Got him!
- No!

1030
01:24:46,284 --> 01:24:48,809
- No! Don't shoot!
- Hold your fire!

1031
01:24:50,488 --> 01:24:54,720
These are God's creatures!
They're our friends!

1032
01:24:54,826 --> 01:24:58,227
- Oh, God!
- Okay, go ahead. Fire.

1033
01:25:01,099 --> 01:25:05,229
I got an injured girl here.
Looks like she's on drugs.

1034
01:25:05,337 --> 01:25:07,703
And, uh, a man down.

1035
01:25:07,806 --> 01:25:11,572
- No, don't leave me! Don't go! Please!
- Let go of my leg.

1036
01:25:11,676 --> 01:25:13,701
- Miss.
- Please!

1037
01:25:13,812 --> 01:25:16,747
You gotta let go of my leg.
Hey, whoa!

1038
01:25:16,848 --> 01:25:18,826
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Easy, easy! Whoa! No, no, no, no!

1039
01:25:18,850 --> 01:25:22,047
Hey, hey, hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1040
01:25:22,153 --> 01:25:25,213
Give me the gun. Give me the gun.
What are you doin'?

1041
01:25:25,323 --> 01:25:27,587
Come on! What are you, crazy?

1042
01:25:27,692 --> 01:25:30,661
What are you doin'?

1043
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:52,570
Sam was her name-

1044
01:26:52,677 --> 01:26:58,206
And for only one brief moment-

1045
01:26:58,316 --> 01:27:02,776
- She fell into my lap -

1046
01:27:02,887 --> 01:27:07,119
- Seems she had everything I wanted-

1047
01:27:07,225 --> 01:27:09,693
- In a girl-

1048
01:27:09,794 --> 01:27:14,527
- She paints her nails like my guitar -

1049
01:27:14,632 --> 01:27:19,399
- She played it
and that was the start -

1050
01:27:19,504 --> 01:27:24,203
- She danced like a wicked angel -

1051
01:27:24,309 --> 01:27:29,372
- She danced to the beat of my heart -

1052
01:27:32,350 --> 01:27:34,648
Jesus!

1053
01:27:46,764 --> 01:27:51,360
- She told me you have pretty eyes -

1054
01:28:06,584 --> 01:28:10,179
Look at this mess! Somebody's gonna
have hell to pay, that's for sure.

1055
01:28:10,288 --> 01:28:12,688
Jesus! This place stinks!

1056
01:28:13,858 --> 01:28:16,224
I'm goddamn fucked!

1057
01:28:19,330 --> 01:28:22,424
Hey, laughin' boy, come on.
Give me the... balloon.

1058
01:28:22,534 --> 01:28:24,502
Get out of here!

1059
01:28:26,604 --> 01:28:29,767
You okay?

1060
01:28:29,874 --> 01:28:32,399
You ever heard of
the trickle-down effect, Cooper?

1061
01:28:32,510 --> 01:28:34,410
I don't know.

1062
01:28:34,512 --> 01:28:37,948
It's when one big asshole goes crazy,
and the whole world goes to shit.

1063
01:28:38,049 --> 01:28:40,017
Hang on.

1064
01:28:41,719 --> 01:28:45,883
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

1065
01:28:45,990 --> 01:28:47,958
Good.

1066
01:28:50,361 --> 01:28:52,261
What?

1067
01:28:52,363 --> 01:28:55,196
We went up to the field.

1068
01:28:55,300 --> 01:28:57,131
We didn't find Gus's body.

1069
01:29:04,976 --> 01:29:07,467
Shit.

1070
01:29:56,361 --> 01:29:58,261
Fuck you!

1071
01:29:59,364 --> 01:30:01,730
Yeah!

1072
01:30:05,536 --> 01:30:07,856
Thank you.

1073
01:30:09,974 --> 01:30:13,137
Thank you so much.

1074
01:30:13,244 --> 01:30:15,269
It's not about protecting
so much...

1075
01:30:15,380 --> 01:30:19,043
the fish and the Earth for their
own sake, or nature for its own sake...

1076
01:30:19,150 --> 01:30:22,881
but recognizing that nature
is the infrastructure of our communities.

1077
01:30:22,987 --> 01:30:25,854
And that if we wanna
meet our obligation...

1078
01:30:25,957 --> 01:30:28,625
as a generation,
as a nation, a civilization...

1079
01:30:28,626 --> 01:30:29,183
as a generation,
as a nation, a civilization...

1080
01:30:29,294 --> 01:30:31,956
which is to create
communities for our children...

1081
01:30:32,063 --> 01:30:36,591
that provide them with the same
opportunities for dignity and enrichment...

1082
01:30:36,701 --> 01:30:38,965
as the communities
that our parents gave us...

1083
01:30:39,070 --> 01:30:41,664
we've gotta start by protecting
our environmental infrastructure-

1084
01:30:41,773 --> 01:30:43,673
the air we breathe,
the water we drink...

1085
01:30:43,775 --> 01:30:47,370
the shared resources,
the fisheries and the wildlife...

1086
01:30:47,478 --> 01:30:49,969
and the public lands
that enrich us...

1087
01:30:50,081 --> 01:30:52,879
that connect us to our history
and to our past...

1088
01:30:52,984 --> 01:30:55,817
that provide context
to our communities...

1089
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:59,151
and that are the source
ultimately of our values...

1090
01:30:59,257 --> 01:31:02,556
and virtues
and our character as a people.

1091
01:31:02,660 --> 01:31:06,494
And I wanna talk about some of those issues
about the environment tonight...

1092
01:31:06,597 --> 01:31:09,964
but more importantly
about the impact...

1093
01:31:10,068 --> 01:31:13,834
of excessive corporate power
on America...

1094
01:31:13,938 --> 01:31:17,601
not just on the environment,
but on American democracy.

1095
01:31:17,709 --> 01:31:20,576
And I don't think...

1096
01:31:20,678 --> 01:31:23,977
there's any such thing as
Republican children or Democratic children.

1097
01:31:24,082 --> 01:31:26,562
I think the worst thing
that could happen to the environment...

1098
01:31:26,617 --> 01:31:29,518
is if it becomes a province...

1099
01:31:29,620 --> 01:31:32,680
of a single political party,
as it seems to have done.

1100
01:31:32,790 --> 01:31:37,318
But you can't talk honestly about
the environment in any context today...

1101
01:31:37,428 --> 01:31:39,487
without speaking critically
of this president.

1102
01:31:39,597 --> 01:31:41,827
This is the worst
environmental president...

1103
01:31:41,933 --> 01:31:44,731
that we 've ever had
in American history bar none.

1104
01:31:46,838 --> 01:31:50,171
And if you go to
N. R. D. C. 'S Web site-

1105
01:31:50,274 --> 01:31:51,935
the Natural Resource
Defense Council...

1106
01:31:52,043 --> 01:31:53,943
which is one of the groups
for which we work-

1107
01:31:54,045 --> 01:31:57,708
you'll see over 400 major
environmental rollbacks listed there...

1108
01:31:57,815 --> 01:32:00,409
that have been promoted
or implemented by this administration...

1109
01:32:00,518 --> 01:32:02,611
over the past four years...

1110
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:04,711
as part of a deliberate
concerted effort...

1111
01:32:04,822 --> 01:32:07,313
to eviscerate 30years
of environmental law.

1112
01:32:07,425 --> 01:32:09,723
It's a stealth attack.
The White House has used...

1113
01:32:09,827 --> 01:32:12,660
all these kind of
ingenuous machinations...

1114
01:32:12,764 --> 01:32:16,495
to conceal its radical agenda
from the American people...

1115
01:32:16,601 --> 01:32:18,501
including Orwellian rhetoric.

1116
01:32:18,603 --> 01:32:21,563
When they want to destroy the forests,
they call it the Healthy Forest Act.

1117
01:32:21,639 --> 01:32:24,733
When they want to destroy the air,
they call it the Clear Skies Bill.

1118
01:32:24,842 --> 01:32:28,437
But most insidiously,
they have put polluters in charge...

1119
01:32:28,546 --> 01:32:32,346
of virtually all the agencies that are
supposed to protect Americans from pollution.

1120
01:32:32,450 --> 01:32:35,510
The head of the Forest Service
is a timber industry lobbyist...

1121
01:32:35,620 --> 01:32:38,180
probably the most rapacious
in history.

1122
01:32:38,289 --> 01:32:41,622
The head of public lands
is a mining industry lobbyist...

1123
01:32:41,726 --> 01:32:45,719
who believes that public lands
are unconstitutional.

1124
01:32:45,830 --> 01:32:49,857
The head of the air division,
E.P.A., is a utility lobbyist...

1125
01:32:49,967 --> 01:32:53,801
who's represented nothing but
the worst air polluters in our country.

1126
01:32:53,905 --> 01:32:56,305
The head of Superfund
is a woman whose last job...

1127
01:32:56,407 --> 01:32:59,342
was teaching corporate polluters
how to evade Superfund.

1128
01:32:59,444 --> 01:33:02,880
The second in command of E.P.A.
is a Monsanto lobbyist, and on and on.

1129
01:33:02,980 --> 01:33:06,040
If you go through all of
the departments of government...

1130
01:33:06,150 --> 01:33:08,050
that are relevant
to the environment-

1131
01:33:08,152 --> 01:33:12,486
the Department of Energy and Agriculture
and Interior and the E.P.A...

1132
01:33:12,590 --> 01:33:16,253
and even the relevant divisions of the justice
department-you'll find the same thing.

1133
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:18,920
It's the polluters
who are running the agencies...

1134
01:33:19,030 --> 01:33:21,089
that are supposed to
protect us from pollution.

1135
01:33:21,199 --> 01:33:24,600
And a couple of weeks ago,
it was revealed in the New York Times...

1136
01:33:24,702 --> 01:33:29,605
that this character,
who's the second in command of the C.E.Q...

1137
01:33:29,707 --> 01:33:31,585
which is the Council
on Environmental Quality...

1138
01:33:31,609 --> 01:33:33,873
was in the White House
advising the president...

1139
01:33:33,978 --> 01:33:36,776
on the environmental implications
of all of his policies.

1140
01:33:36,881 --> 01:33:40,874
And as it turns out, he's an
American Petroleum Institute lobbyist...

1141
01:33:40,985 --> 01:33:44,352
whose primary job
over the past four years...

1142
01:33:44,455 --> 01:33:48,391
has been combing through
every federal scientific document...

1143
01:33:48,493 --> 01:33:52,623
and removing any
inculpatory information...

1144
01:33:52,730 --> 01:33:54,891
about the oil and coal industry.

1145
01:33:54,999 --> 01:33:58,958
And he has suppressed
12 major studies on global warming...

1146
01:33:59,070 --> 01:34:02,062
and altered hundreds and hundreds
of studies-Ronald Reagan-

1147
01:34:02,173 --> 01:34:04,437
of anything that is critical
of the oil or coal-

1148
01:34:04,542 --> 01:34:08,034
that says something connects,
you know, oil or coal to some bad-

1149
01:34:08,145 --> 01:34:11,979
Ronald Reagan-
scientific circumstance.

1150
01:34:12,083 --> 01:34:15,712
So his job is to lie-
Ronald Reagan-in public.

1151
01:34:15,820 --> 01:34:19,620
And, you know, there's nothing wrong
with having businesspeople in government.

1152
01:34:19,724 --> 01:34:23,660
It's a good thing if your objective
is to recruit confidence and expertise.

1153
01:34:23,761 --> 01:34:28,698
But in all of the-Ronald Reagan-
situations, as I show in my book...

1154
01:34:28,799 --> 01:34:30,699
these individuals-
Ronald Reagan-

1155
01:34:30,801 --> 01:34:33,565
have not entered government service
for the public interest...

1156
01:34:33,671 --> 01:34:37,539
but rather to subvert the very laws
that they're now charged-Ronald Reagan-

1157
01:34:37,642 --> 01:34:40,941
in order to enrich the president's
corporate paymasters.

1158
01:34:41,045 --> 01:34:46,881
And they've imposed dramatic and
catastrophic impacts on the American public.

1159
01:34:46,984 --> 01:34:49,179
Most of us don 't know it
in this country...

1160
01:34:49,287 --> 01:34:53,121
because we have an indolent
and negligent press-Ronald Reagan-

1161
01:34:53,224 --> 01:34:56,091
that has simply let down
American democracy.

1162
01:34:56,193 --> 01:34:59,560
Ronald Reagan. That's- And I-

1163
01:34:59,664 --> 01:35:02,189
You know, I'll just
tell you something about that.

1164
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:06,930
The decline of American journalism
began in 1988...

1165
01:35:07,038 --> 01:35:09,472
when Ronald Reagan abolished
the Fairness Doctrine.

1166
01:35:09,574 --> 01:35:14,238
We had a law in this country that
required the press to behave responsibly.

1167
01:35:14,345 --> 01:35:17,314
And the Fairness Doctrine
was passed in 1928...

1168
01:35:17,415 --> 01:35:19,940
and said that the airwaves
belong to the public-

1169
01:35:20,051 --> 01:35:23,214
that the broadcasters
can be licensed to use them-

1170
01:35:23,321 --> 01:35:25,653
Ronald Reagan-Ronald Reagan-
Ronald Reagan-

1171
01:35:25,756 --> 01:35:28,520
Ronald Reagan-Ronald Reagan-

1172
01:35:35,866 --> 01:35:38,468
Feel the vibration in
the jubilation, fool!

1173
01:35:38,493 --> 01:35:40,088
I can feel it! I feel.

1174
01:35:40,171 --> 01:35:44,130
God's kingdom government
and the son of Yahweh will return!

1175
01:35:44,241 --> 01:35:49,372
- Yahweh!
- Return from the-to overthrow the ruler!

1176
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:53,177
Yes!

1177
01:35:53,284 --> 01:35:56,447
- Yes!
- Go on, Willis!

1178
01:35:56,554 --> 01:35:58,454
All right!

1179
01:35:58,556 --> 01:36:01,457
Whoo-hoo!
Destroy the wicked one!

1180
01:36:01,559 --> 01:36:03,459
- Go on, Willis!
- Destroy him!

1181
01:36:03,561 --> 01:36:06,758
For he who sayeth is a soothsayer!

1182
01:36:08,866 --> 01:36:12,700
Satan, get behind me
and pursueth the heathen!

1183
01:36:12,803 --> 01:36:17,740
Whoa to the soothsayer
who was the inducer of soot!

1184
01:36:17,842 --> 01:36:21,608
And yea to the one who prevail
over the temptation of evil!

1185
01:36:21,712 --> 01:36:23,612
Get your hand out of my pocket!

1186
01:36:23,714 --> 01:36:26,478
- Beelzebub and his herd of dark angels...
- That's some bullshit!

1187
01:36:26,584 --> 01:36:30,076
- Come and block off sleep in the night!
- That's some bullshit, Reverend!

1188
01:36:30,187 --> 01:36:33,315
- Behold, you heathen!
- Heathens!

1189
01:36:33,424 --> 01:36:36,916
Behold, my heathen,
because devil behind me!

1190
01:36:43,234 --> 01:36:46,169
- The blood of Abraham!
- Ecclesiastes!

1191
01:36:46,270 --> 01:36:49,137
Holy shit! Whoa!

1192
01:36:49,240 --> 01:36:52,437
Brother Eli!

1193
01:36:52,543 --> 01:36:55,341
Don't stop!

1194
01:36:55,446 --> 01:37:00,076
- Jacob!
- The man has spoken!

1195
01:37:00,184 --> 01:37:03,415
- Proverbs!
- Mary had children!

1196
01:37:06,757 --> 01:37:09,749
- Jehoshaphat!
- What's the word, Thunderbird?
