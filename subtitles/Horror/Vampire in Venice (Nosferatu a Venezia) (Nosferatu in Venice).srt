[ LOUIS ] So you want me to tell you
the story of my life.

3
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,359
[ MALLOY ] Like I said, that's what I do.
I interview people.

You'll need a lot of tape for my story.

No problem. I got a bag full of tape.

You followed me here, didn't you?

00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,829
Yeah, I suppose I did.

10

This is where you live?

You mean this literally, I take it?

19

[ LOUIS ] Absolutely.

20
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,079
I was waiting for you in that alleyway.

What a lucky break for me.

24

Perhaps lucky for both of us.

What were you gonna do?
Kill me, drink my blood?

[ LOUIS ] Yes.

But you needn't be concerned now.

30
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,109
[ MALLOY ] You really believe this,
don't you, that you're a vampire?

31
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,889
We can't begin this way.

32
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,649
Let me turn on the light.

33
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,989
- I thought vampires didn't like light.
- We love it.

- Don't be frightened.

How can I put you at ease?

Shall we begin like David Copperﬁeld?

46
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,239
I am born. I grew up.

47

Or shall we begin when I was born
to darkness, as I call it.

48
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,959
That's really where we should start,
don't you think?

49

You're not lying, are you?

50
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,759
[ LOUIS ] Why should I lie?

51
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,219
1791 was the year it happened.

52
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,939
[ LOUIS ] I was 24.

Younger than you are now.

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,899
But times were different then.
I was a man at that age.

The master of a large plantation,
just south of New Orleans.

I had lost my wife in childbirth.

She and the infant had been buried
less than half a year.

I would've been happy to join them.

Most of all, I longed for death.
