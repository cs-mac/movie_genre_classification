- All-purpose elixir!
- Most efficacious!

13
00:01:59,158 --> 00:02:00,580
Cures all ills!

14
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,787
Hello, Tamiya.

15
00:02:16,467 --> 00:02:19,138
Which is it,
gambling or women?

16
00:02:22,052 --> 00:02:26,297
- Your wife not back yet?
- Bastard!

17
00:02:27,609 --> 00:02:31,755
Naosuke, there aren't any
customers here.

18
00:02:31,755 --> 00:02:33,007
You shut up!

19
00:02:33,008 --> 00:02:41,495
You're a retainer of the
Tokugawa shogunate.

20
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:44,394
The government pays your wages.

21
00:02:45,226 --> 00:02:50,406
Your runaway wife is from a
ruined samurai family.

22
00:02:50,407 --> 00:02:54,297
<i>Hey, medicine man!
What's it good for?</i>

23
00:02:57,714 --> 00:03:01,473
It's time to give her up.

24
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:04,976
Naosuke...

25
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:11,733
you know why Oiwa ran
away from me?

26
00:03:12,814 --> 00:03:19,221
I killed that man in the den
last December.

27
00:03:22,465 --> 00:03:28,654
She didn't want to have a...
murderer for a husband.

28
00:03:31,108 --> 00:03:36,608
But mark my words:
I'll get her back.

29
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:43,804
I'll never find another woman with
such a beautiful body.

30
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:46,962
Huh, what a thing to say!

31
00:03:49,406 --> 00:03:52,107
What are you doing here today?

32
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:59,203
Oiwa's father brought her sister to
the masseur's place.

33
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:04,125
I'm waiting here...
for him to come back.

34
00:04:11,522 --> 00:04:15,023
<i>Employee's Entrance</i>

35
00:04:24,352 --> 00:04:28,210
Would you please put your
thumbprint here.

36
00:04:50,988 --> 00:04:56,958
Osode, now you're indentured,

37
00:04:50,988 --> 00:04:56,958
Osode, now you're indentured,

38
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:00,267
Do as your master tells you.

39
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:06,562
Father, I'll work as hard as my
salary demands.

40
00:05:07,661 --> 00:05:08,641
How dare you?!

41
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:13,026
It's not a difficult position.

42
00:05:13,027 --> 00:05:19,182
She only has to tend the toothpick stall
in the temple precincts.

43
00:05:21,246 --> 00:05:22,350
And these women?

44
00:05:24,317 --> 00:05:28,524
That's our other business.
But we keep them separate.

45
00:05:30,453 --> 00:05:33,705
Excuse me.
Go inside, dear.

46
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:40,125
Change this rag for one of ours.

47
00:05:40,126 --> 00:05:43,707
I'll bill you for the kimono later.

48
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:46,257
You can start work at the stall
right away.

49
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,149
Yomoshichi! Yomoshichi...

50
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,895
we're due back by now.

51
00:05:52,896 --> 00:05:56,950
If I miss this chance,
I won't see her for a year.

52
00:05:56,951 --> 00:05:58,986
- How stupid!
- Who's stupid?

53
00:05:58,987 --> 00:06:01,466
You are! You just don't get it.

54
00:06:07,682 --> 00:06:14,156
I know you're keen to see the
one you're betrothed to.

55
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:20,522
But our lord departs for the fief
after a year of duty in Edo.

56
00:06:20,557 --> 00:06:24,719
That's tomorrow.
You need to prepare.

57
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:26,176
You go on ahead.

58
00:06:26,923 --> 00:06:30,351
I have something important to tell her.

59
00:06:30,352 --> 00:06:32,713
But she's not at home.

60
00:06:32,714 --> 00:06:36,599
Oiwa said she went to the
masseur's place.

61
00:06:36,634 --> 00:06:37,838
Where's that?

62
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:40,566
I don't know.

63
00:06:41,076 --> 00:06:43,184
- You are stupid!
- So what?!

64
00:06:52,722 --> 00:06:57,546
That idiot sent Oiwa's sister to
work at the masseur's.

65
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:04,498
Oiwa sure is beautiful,
but her sister's even better!

66
00:07:04,499 --> 00:07:06,487
I'd choose the sister!

67
00:07:06,488 --> 00:07:09,990
- You can buy her tonight.
- Eh?

68
00:07:09,991 --> 00:07:12,822
That massage parlour is
a whorehouse.

69
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:15,489
A whorehouse?

70
00:07:15,524 --> 00:07:19,186
Yes, at night they massage
something else!

71
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:22,872
Shall I ask them to reserve
her for you?

72
00:07:26,874 --> 00:07:27,832
No, thank you.

73
00:07:28,931 --> 00:07:31,479
What? You're going back?

74
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,360
Why shouldn't I?

75
00:07:33,361 --> 00:07:35,020
But she'll want to see you.

76
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,980
- It's too late now.
- You fool!

77
00:07:36,981 --> 00:07:38,429
Yes, I know I am.

78
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:43,491
You won't even listen?
You won't try to help?

79
00:07:43,491 --> 00:07:45,493
- You're a coward!
- Stop it!

80
00:08:01,205 --> 00:08:05,009
Naosuke, if that dotard
refuses again...

81
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,268
I know. Leave him to me.

82
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:08,419
Be on time.

83
00:08:15,023 --> 00:08:19,263
Naosuke! Naosuke!
We have a customer!

84
00:08:19,264 --> 00:08:21,502
I'm busy. You go alone.

85
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:24,348
Our master will be furious.

86
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:25,620
Give up, man!

87
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:28,194
Father!

88
00:08:31,456 --> 00:08:33,535
Father, please help me out.

89
00:08:33,536 --> 00:08:37,631
I'll not have the likes of you
calling me 'father'!

90
00:08:37,632 --> 00:08:40,370
Please... just hear me out.

91
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,793
There's no point!

92
00:08:42,817 --> 00:08:49,348
Even if you won't listen,
Oiwa is still my wife.

93
00:08:49,349 --> 00:08:52,975
I want her to come back immediately.

94
00:08:52,976 --> 00:08:57,300
My daughter will have no murderer
for a husband.

95
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,177
What did you say...?

96
00:09:01,178 --> 00:09:05,774
I was considerate enough not to
have you arrested.

97
00:09:10,168 --> 00:09:11,178
Begone with you!

98
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:14,901
Are you all right?

99
00:09:23,883 --> 00:09:24,990
I'm sorry.

100
00:09:26,522 --> 00:09:28,337
Where's your hairpin?

101
00:09:29,687 --> 00:09:30,699
Maid...?

102
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:55,751
I'm terribly sorry.

103
00:09:58,851 --> 00:10:00,019
You're not hurt?

104
00:10:21,061 --> 00:10:22,523
I'm not going in.

105
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,569
Please, come in.

106
00:10:52,707 --> 00:10:54,649
I'll go see what they want.

107
00:10:55,616 --> 00:10:59,375
Hey... that new girl is mine.

108
00:11:13,163 --> 00:11:14,770
I'll go home, after all.

109
00:11:14,771 --> 00:11:16,391
OK, Go.

110
00:11:17,455 --> 00:11:18,769
I will!

111
00:11:20,156 --> 00:11:22,208
I'll bring her here now.

112
00:11:28,745 --> 00:11:30,755
What now?
Go on, go home.

113
00:11:33,137 --> 00:11:35,519
When I'm good and ready!

114
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:43,183
Then how will you pay back
this money?

115
00:11:43,184 --> 00:11:45,487
- I never agreed.
- It's in the contract.

116
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,724
Do as she says!

117
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:54,204
No violence!
You can't force her.

118
00:11:54,204 --> 00:11:55,896
She just needs persuading.

119
00:11:55,896 --> 00:11:58,437
Anyway, she has a client
waiting upstairs.

120
00:11:58,438 --> 00:11:59,662
Come on!

121
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:03,640
Hey! What about me?

122
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:06,192
The men upstairs paid
one gold piece.

123
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:08,757
He who pays more,
goes first.

124
00:12:11,016 --> 00:12:12,191
All right, then...

125
00:12:14,944 --> 00:12:18,022
There's two gold ryo.
She's mine.

126
00:12:18,023 --> 00:12:20,267
What shall we do?

127
00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:24,142
He paid more.
They can't complain.

128
00:12:24,145 --> 00:12:25,514
Then it's decided!

129
00:12:34,398 --> 00:12:35,447
Stop it!

130
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:41,566
Not here. In there.

131
00:13:12,188 --> 00:13:14,534
Please let me go!

132
00:13:15,047 --> 00:13:18,713
Once I get going,
there's no stopping me.

133
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:22,685
You monster!
I'm already betrothed.

134
00:13:24,631 --> 00:13:25,850
That sounds like Osode!

135
00:13:28,312 --> 00:13:30,365
Ouch! Don't bite me!

136
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,041
You bastard!

137
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:35,294
You coward!

138
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,478
I'll get him!

139
00:13:45,037 --> 00:13:47,125
What's going on?

140
00:13:50,226 --> 00:13:53,456
- Close the door!
- Yes!

141
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,331
How dare you?

142
00:13:59,942 --> 00:14:01,392
We're very sorry.

143
00:14:03,095 --> 00:14:06,674
We paid for her,
so she's ours.

144
00:14:22,398 --> 00:14:23,864
Osode, my darling!

145
00:14:33,418 --> 00:14:37,883
Prepare some 'moxibustion'
for me!

146
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,843
Something with a bite!

147
00:14:49,871 --> 00:14:53,326
Who are those men?

148
00:14:53,327 --> 00:14:56,956
One of them is engaged to her.

149
00:14:56,957 --> 00:15:00,427
- Which one?
- The one in white.

150
00:15:02,226 --> 00:15:05,805
Damn him!
You, come back!

151
00:15:33,251 --> 00:15:37,548
Please wait one year till I return.

152
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:41,449
When I come back next year,

153
00:15:41,484 --> 00:15:45,562
I'll get permission to marry you.

154
00:15:50,722 --> 00:15:54,840
I fell for that wench!
I really love her!

155
00:15:54,841 --> 00:15:59,813
I'll never give her up.
Osode is mine!

156
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,195
Thank you.

157
00:16:09,783 --> 00:16:13,129
- Is this yours?
- No, it's Yomoshichi's.

158
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:16,161
Well, I'll be damned if I'm going
back up there!

159
00:16:16,632 --> 00:16:20,218
Getting along well, are they?
I'll take it.

160
00:16:22,317 --> 00:16:27,806
I'll go have a drink. If you're not ready,
I'll go back alone.

161
00:16:40,171 --> 00:16:42,829
It's Naosuke...?

162
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,927
Listen, Oiwa...

163
00:16:51,204 --> 00:16:53,035
Is this Osode's father?

164
00:16:53,906 --> 00:16:59,923
Osode was forced to entertain
a client tonight.

165
00:17:02,145 --> 00:17:05,163
That cur, Takuetsu!

166
00:17:07,398 --> 00:17:09,186
I'll go with you.

167
00:17:12,687 --> 00:17:14,451
You stay here.

168
00:17:37,902 --> 00:17:45,266
Mother... mother,
please protect Osode.

169
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,638
Treacherous dog!

170
00:18:17,118 --> 00:18:18,224
You cowards...

171
00:18:38,441 --> 00:18:41,153
- Prepare to die!
- I curse you!

172
00:18:57,601 --> 00:19:03,023
That's him. He's the one...
He's dead!

173
00:20:12,785 --> 00:20:15,867
- Mr. Tamiya!
- Husband!

174
00:20:58,628 --> 00:21:02,600
- Who killed him?
- Two young samurai.

175
00:21:03,216 --> 00:21:08,844
Your father killed the one wearing
this white robe.

176
00:21:10,501 --> 00:21:16,325
The other made the head cut
that killed him.

177
00:21:18,631 --> 00:21:21,587
He took Yomoshichi's body with him.

178
00:21:25,164 --> 00:21:27,913
I will seek revenge.

179
00:21:29,036 --> 00:21:31,954
Revenge for my father-in-law.

180
00:21:34,821 --> 00:21:39,169
Wife, this is no time for
us to be apart.

181
00:21:39,852 --> 00:21:41,424
I want you back.

182
00:21:49,857 --> 00:21:55,528
Osode, in order to throw
them off the track,

183
00:21:55,529 --> 00:22:00,190
you protect yourself by moving
in with Naosuke.

184
00:22:00,191 --> 00:22:01,651
You can't be serious?!

185
00:22:01,652 --> 00:22:05,265
Since we're partners,
I'm obliged to help out.

186
00:22:05,266 --> 00:22:11,496
I will do whatever it takes to protect
your sister-in-law.

187
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:41,216
<i>A year has passed...</i>

188
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,488
Having the baby has spoiled
her beauty.

189
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:13,477
How can we raise a child
in this poverty?

190
00:23:14,118 --> 00:23:19,025
She's been bed-ridden
since she had it.

191
00:23:19,026 --> 00:23:23,577
Your dream to be promoted
in the ranks...

192
00:23:23,578 --> 00:23:27,487
may end up as just a dream.

193
00:23:32,114 --> 00:23:34,389
I want money so badly...

194
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:42,752
One good bribe and I'd get
the position I want.

195
00:23:59,003 --> 00:24:01,576
Who's that lass?

196
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,570
A pretty girl?

197
00:24:10,505 --> 00:24:13,117
Tell us. Who is she?

198
00:24:13,117 --> 00:24:14,839
None of your business.

199
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:22,245
A neighbour.
They just moved in.

200
00:24:22,246 --> 00:24:27,556
Not only that. She certainly
had her eye on you.

201
00:24:31,152 --> 00:24:34,768
Tamiya, how much do you earn
making umbrellas?

202
00:24:35,358 --> 00:24:37,612
The money doesn't matter.

203
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:45,650
My wife demands... that I revenge
her father's murder.

204
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:51,352
Tamiya... I know you wanted Oiwa
to die in childbirth.

205
00:24:52,468 --> 00:24:53,948
Don't say that here!

206
00:24:55,533 --> 00:25:00,621
Don't say that here!

207
00:24:55,533 --> 00:25:00,621
Don't say that here!

208
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:04,090
once or twice in his life,
at a minimum!

209
00:25:07,099 --> 00:25:09,150
Excuse my intrusion...

210
00:25:10,657 --> 00:25:15,214
Your new neighbour wishes to pay
his respects to you.

211
00:25:17,042 --> 00:25:18,375
Excuse me, gentlemen.

212
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:21,946
Oiwa, how do you feel today?

213
00:25:21,947 --> 00:25:25,184
I'll prepare your medicine.

214
00:25:28,478 --> 00:25:32,082
How come he knows the
new neigbours?

215
00:25:33,168 --> 00:25:35,803
<i>Your new neighbours,
the Ito family</i>

216
00:25:37,177 --> 00:25:39,656
Thank you for inviting me.

217
00:25:39,657 --> 00:25:42,070
In order to further our
acquaintance,

218
00:25:42,071 --> 00:25:47,214
we'd be honoured to have you
over for dinner tonight.

219
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:53,349
# Oh, how I long to build... #

220
00:25:53,350 --> 00:26:00,178
# a teahouse so very fine. #

221
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:09,275
# A place to await the boat, #

222
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:14,162
# which goes both upstream... #

223
00:26:14,163 --> 00:26:19,322
# and downstream, up and down. #

224
00:26:19,323 --> 00:26:24,037
# 'Tis a fine day in Kisarazu, #

225
00:26:24,038 --> 00:26:30,856
# but Edo is wreathed in cloud. #

226
00:26:30,857 --> 00:26:39,364
# Now a man, to be fair,
to be just, #

227
00:26:39,365 --> 00:26:48,715
# is handsomely browned by
the harsh sun. #

228
00:26:50,128 --> 00:26:53,456
- If you'll excuse me.
- Thank you for coming.

229
00:27:13,226 --> 00:27:15,932
You shouldn't get up.

230
00:27:16,415 --> 00:27:23,869
Since I've been sick, my husband has
nothing to wear when going out.

231
00:27:24,882 --> 00:27:29,225
I should at least finish off
this jacket.

232
00:27:29,852 --> 00:27:33,023
You are such a good wife, Oiwa.

233
00:27:34,331 --> 00:27:36,849
I only wish he appreciated you.

234
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:38,560
Don't say that.

235
00:27:39,975 --> 00:27:45,855
Once I fully recover,
he's bound to change.

236
00:27:46,693 --> 00:27:50,875
Then he can seek revenge for
my father's murder.

237
00:27:56,362 --> 00:27:57,409
Maid...

238
00:27:59,348 --> 00:28:00,858
I beseech your favour.

239
00:28:14,525 --> 00:28:21,784
Mr. Tamiya,
I know this is a sudden offer,

240
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:24,535
but we'd like you to accept these.

241
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:30,876
Mr. Tamiya,
please look at my daughter.

242
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:36,372
Since she ran into you last year
at the temple,

243
00:28:36,407 --> 00:28:41,261
she fell deeply in love
and became ill.

244
00:28:44,732 --> 00:28:49,462
We searched for you and finally,
today...

245
00:28:54,537 --> 00:28:56,448
Thank you for your offer...

246
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:02,477
but I have a wife and child,
both officially registered.

247
00:29:02,717 --> 00:29:03,930
We understand.

248
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:12,499
If money can resolve your problem,
I'll offer whatever is needed.

249
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:32,746
I didn't hear you enter.

250
00:29:32,781 --> 00:29:37,887
How are the neighbours?

251
00:29:50,294 --> 00:29:57,105
<i>Your hopes of promotion will
end up as just a dream.</i>

252
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:01,294
<i>I need money.</i>

253
00:30:01,295 --> 00:30:04,350
<i>I could buy a worthy position.</i>

254
00:30:05,348 --> 00:30:12,178
<i>If money can resolve your problem,
I'll offer whatever is needed.</i>

255
00:30:26,689 --> 00:30:30,781
Oiwa... give me money!
Money!

256
00:30:30,816 --> 00:30:35,114
- We don't have any!
- Yes... you do.

257
00:30:35,149 --> 00:30:36,669
Where are you going?

258
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:39,332
I need to get out and drink!

259
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:43,293
Please don't.
You'll wake the baby.

260
00:30:51,942 --> 00:30:54,322
I know you have some.
Hand it over!

261
00:30:55,299 --> 00:30:57,918
You've saved some secretly.

262
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,308
I would never do that.
Please don't...

263
00:31:02,595 --> 00:31:03,809
You obstinate bitch!

264
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:10,168
All right, I'll pawn something.

265
00:31:10,203 --> 00:31:12,293
Please, don't!

266
00:31:18,598 --> 00:31:20,867
This is worth something.

267
00:31:23,513 --> 00:31:27,039
No! That's the only thing I have
of my mother's.

268
00:31:37,034 --> 00:31:38,349
Get it off!

269
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:45,643
Please... take this kimono instead.

270
00:31:45,644 --> 00:31:48,212
I don't want this rag!

271
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:52,981
This mosquito net will sell.

272
00:31:52,982 --> 00:31:57,498
No, please don't!
He'll get bitten by mosquitoes.

273
00:31:57,499 --> 00:32:03,024
Drive the bloody things away.
That's your job!

274
00:32:05,597 --> 00:32:09,697
- You're too cruel!
- Let go!

275
00:32:10,376 --> 00:32:12,585
Please don't!

276
00:32:18,802 --> 00:32:21,190
You stupid, obstinate bitch!

277
00:32:23,015 --> 00:32:25,165
All right, Oiwa.

278
00:32:27,676 --> 00:32:34,272
You'll never let go, will you?
No matter what I do.

279
00:33:03,577 --> 00:33:06,525
It's all right. There, there...

280
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:10,318
<i>Laundry, Alterations & Repairs</i>

281
00:34:57,115 --> 00:34:59,390
Naosuke, are you in?

282
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:15,467
Can you go out?

283
00:35:15,502 --> 00:35:21,282
I was planning on going fishing.
Want to come?

284
00:35:21,668 --> 00:35:22,981
Fishing...?

285
00:35:26,994 --> 00:35:31,950
How's my sister?

Is she any better?

286
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:35,899
She's at home.

287
00:35:36,541 --> 00:35:38,022
How's the baby?

288
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,389
They're both home.

289
00:36:04,512 --> 00:36:10,094
If you're worried, ask Kohei to tend
to your sister today.

290
00:36:11,706 --> 00:36:12,759
<i>Hello?</i>

291
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,854
Coming.

292
00:36:14,811 --> 00:36:17,332
Some of those flowers, please.

293
00:36:24,887 --> 00:36:27,059
- How about these?
- They'll do fine.

294
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,033
That'll be 16 copper pieces.

295
00:36:29,034 --> 00:36:30,386
Thank you very much.

296
00:36:37,834 --> 00:36:40,087
- Hey, Naosuke...
- What?

297
00:36:40,122 --> 00:36:45,574
You still haven't bedded Osode,
have you?

298
00:36:49,309 --> 00:36:51,411
She always carries a dagger.

299
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:56,614
She puts it to her throat and
says she'll kill herself.

300
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,495
She's not much use to me dead.

301
00:37:08,373 --> 00:37:11,987
- Is Kohei there?
- Yes, I'm here.

302
00:37:12,357 --> 00:37:16,265
- How's your mother?
- No change.

303
00:37:16,853 --> 00:37:23,143
Can you go and see to my sister?
I'll stay with your mother.

304
00:37:23,144 --> 00:37:24,676
All right, then.

305
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:28,025
Thank you.

306
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:36,633
Mother, just a little bit more and we
can buy your medicine.

307
00:37:39,241 --> 00:37:43,554
Tamiya - if you really want to
get rid of Oiwa,

308
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:46,748
why not kill her?

309
00:37:49,187 --> 00:37:53,972
That way, Osode will be all alone.

310
00:37:55,544 --> 00:37:58,012
Then I can easily have her.

311
00:38:00,228 --> 00:38:03,661
A simpleton's solutions are
always simple.

312
00:38:04,344 --> 00:38:09,333
And you're always right,
aren't you?

313
00:38:10,816 --> 00:38:13,403
Listen, Naosuke...

314
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:19,087
one's reputation affects one's
promotion prospects.

315
00:38:20,345 --> 00:38:26,715
I need a strong reason,
one for which she'd deserve death.

316
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:31,575
Hey, Naosuke...

317
00:38:36,763 --> 00:38:37,968
What is it?

318
00:38:55,952 --> 00:38:57,622
Bodies...

319
00:39:04,649 --> 00:39:07,167
A lover's suicide, is it?

320
00:39:07,167 --> 00:39:10,594
More like lovers put to death.

321
00:39:10,595 --> 00:39:13,771
Probably an adulterous affair.

322
00:39:19,612 --> 00:39:26,866
A samurai's wife had an affair
with a servant.

323
00:39:26,866 --> 00:39:29,246
A rumour soon spread.

324
00:39:31,007 --> 00:39:35,869
They were nailed to a board
and tortured to death,

325
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:38,909
their bodies thrown into the river.

326
00:39:46,956 --> 00:39:53,107
Little fellow, it's such a lovely
jacket she's given you.

327
00:39:53,857 --> 00:39:55,678
Let me do it.

328
00:39:57,859 --> 00:39:59,980
Such a lucky boy!

329
00:40:00,678 --> 00:40:05,295
Look, he's smiling.
He takes after his father.

330
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:12,733
Please send my gratitude to your
master and mistress.

331
00:40:15,382 --> 00:40:20,859
This potion has been in the family
for generations.

332
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:26,745
It is especially good for
your complaint.

333
00:40:26,746 --> 00:40:29,081
I'm much obliged to you.

334
00:40:31,587 --> 00:40:33,899
- Be careful.
- Sorry.

335
00:41:00,064 --> 00:41:03,387
This testimonial says it's
good medicine.

336
00:41:04,355 --> 00:41:05,784
Take it.

337
00:41:06,362 --> 00:41:10,958
Will you go and thank the
neighbours for me?

338
00:41:11,596 --> 00:41:14,074
Is that necessary?

339
00:41:14,075 --> 00:41:16,393
Yes, you really should.

340
00:41:22,019 --> 00:41:23,033
Kohei?

341
00:41:50,735 --> 00:41:52,587
Will you wear this?

342
00:42:05,124 --> 00:42:06,694
Are they still painful?

343
00:42:21,869 --> 00:42:25,273
I bought you this.
For your fingers.

344
00:42:29,795 --> 00:42:32,767
<i>Ointment</i>

345
00:42:47,604 --> 00:42:48,954
Husband!

346
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,685
I'll go next door.

347
00:43:09,532 --> 00:43:10,297
Stop!

348
00:43:11,686 --> 00:43:13,384
You'll regret this!

349
00:43:19,439 --> 00:43:20,631
Hand it over.

350
00:43:20,632 --> 00:43:23,451
What are you talking about?

351
00:43:23,855 --> 00:43:26,250
You know what I mean.

352
00:43:29,723 --> 00:43:31,196
You still refuse?

353
00:43:31,231 --> 00:43:32,835
What do you mean?

354
00:43:35,943 --> 00:43:37,227
This is what I mean.

355
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:40,370
Forgive me.

356
00:43:42,299 --> 00:43:47,087
I have no money to buy medicine
for my mother.

357
00:43:52,625 --> 00:43:54,747
Don't try to deceive me...

358
00:43:54,782 --> 00:43:56,975
Please - forgive him.

359
00:43:58,387 --> 00:44:00,174
You stay out of it.

360
00:44:07,877 --> 00:44:13,639
Even a helping hand should be
loyal to his master.

361
00:44:15,234 --> 00:44:21,972
You're an insolent, disloyal cur to steal
your master's goods.

362
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:28,654
Hurts... does it?

363
00:44:35,206 --> 00:44:36,600
Stay back!

364
00:45:18,671 --> 00:45:19,801
Takuetsu...

365
00:45:22,802 --> 00:45:28,197
you watch him while I go out.

366
00:46:08,023 --> 00:46:14,731
If he tries to escape,
kill him with this sword.

367
00:46:20,202 --> 00:46:26,466
Mr. Tamiya, the medicine which I had
my maid give your wife... the thing is...

368
00:46:29,205 --> 00:46:31,146
She's going to take it.

369
00:46:32,907 --> 00:46:35,602
It is a ghastly poison.

370
00:46:37,484 --> 00:46:40,704
We lied to her.

371
00:46:42,831 --> 00:46:46,985
That poison will destroy her face.

372
00:46:50,864 --> 00:46:52,533
It's all my doing.

373
00:46:55,218 --> 00:46:58,359
I did it for my daughter.

374
00:47:01,855 --> 00:47:07,962
The poison will make her
as ugly as sin.

375
00:47:10,716 --> 00:47:12,945
Then you'll hate her.

376
00:47:16,738 --> 00:47:21,582
That is what we want.
I know how dreadful it is.

377
00:47:24,526 --> 00:47:28,631
But I love my daughter.

378
00:47:30,281 --> 00:47:36,393
It breaks my heart that she cannot
have the one she loves.

379
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:47,353
Thank you.

380
00:49:18,052 --> 00:49:21,527
Mistress, what's happening?

381
00:49:23,656 --> 00:49:25,696
What should I do?

382
00:49:25,731 --> 00:49:30,201
What's wrong?
Why are you in agony like this?

383
00:49:47,221 --> 00:49:49,889
What on Earth is going on?

384
00:49:54,138 --> 00:50:00,108
You're so beautiful. If I were a man,
I'd never leave you alone.

385
00:50:00,458 --> 00:50:01,955
Maid, will you stop it?!

386
00:50:01,956 --> 00:50:04,687
- I'll tell Mr. Tamiya!
- No! Don't!

387
00:50:07,773 --> 00:50:08,711
Mother!

388
00:50:13,379 --> 00:50:15,570
Has father finished?

389
00:50:16,511 --> 00:50:21,342
Oume, despite our efforts,
you must also do your best.

390
00:50:22,222 --> 00:50:24,986
You should be decent and modest.

391
00:50:24,987 --> 00:50:27,883
Mr. Tamiya is a samurai,
you understand?

392
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,977
Mistress, was the medicine effective?

393
00:50:35,427 --> 00:50:41,054
You had me very worried
there for a while.

394
00:50:46,547 --> 00:50:50,185
Frankly, I was quite startled!

395
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:06,997
Mistress, how do you feel now?

396
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:10,932
Mistress?

397
00:51:13,953 --> 00:51:17,479
Madame? Where are you?

398
00:51:22,962 --> 00:51:26,072
You shouldn't use such dirty water.

399
00:51:26,073 --> 00:51:30,332
My face suddenly felt like
it was burning.

400
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,226
I couldn't breathe.

401
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:40,188
But now... I feel better.

402
00:51:42,248 --> 00:51:45,678
I'm relieved to hear it.

403
00:51:49,635 --> 00:51:53,959
Is the baby sleeping now?

404
00:52:01,148 --> 00:52:04,802
Ma'am... your face!

405
00:52:05,444 --> 00:52:12,648
What about... my face?

406
00:52:15,328 --> 00:52:19,060
No, I mean you recovered
so quickly.

407
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:22,558
That medicine is very effective.

408
00:52:25,503 --> 00:52:31,702
I still feel a little dizzy,
but I do feel better now.

409
00:52:43,658 --> 00:52:45,701
The lamp is out.

410
00:52:45,702 --> 00:52:53,426
Takuetsu... would you go and get
some oil, please?

411
00:53:11,195 --> 00:53:15,421
- Hurry, please.
- Certainly.

412
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,457
Mr. Tamiya...

413
00:53:28,711 --> 00:53:30,709
She took the medicine?

414
00:53:32,759 --> 00:53:33,940
How about her face?

415
00:53:35,638 --> 00:53:37,413
You knew it was poison?

416
00:53:44,597 --> 00:53:47,547
No! Please stop!

417
00:53:51,721 --> 00:53:57,897
Takuetsu, go and mount her.

418
00:53:57,898 --> 00:53:59,721
Don't be silly!

419
00:54:00,919 --> 00:54:03,365
Then I can divorce her.

420
00:54:03,366 --> 00:54:06,893
You have a woman.

421
00:54:11,542 --> 00:54:13,111
Are you refusing me?

422
00:54:16,192 --> 00:54:17,619
You still say no?

423
00:54:20,828 --> 00:54:22,089
All right, I will.

424
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:27,371
If you don't do it...

425
00:54:30,222 --> 00:54:34,737
you know what'll happen.

426
00:54:39,579 --> 00:54:41,141
Hold out your hand.

427
00:54:52,324 --> 00:54:53,722
Don't fail me.

428
00:55:04,948 --> 00:55:08,252
- I'm back.
- Thank you very much.

429
00:55:13,263 --> 00:55:14,613
I'll bandage it.

430
00:55:16,365 --> 00:55:17,460
Thank you.

431
00:55:34,696 --> 00:55:39,493
I've never read your palm before.
This line looks bad.

432
00:55:40,038 --> 00:55:46,609
If you don't get rid of it,
your sufferings will never cease.

433
00:55:46,975 --> 00:55:51,181
How can I change something
I was born with?

434
00:55:51,956 --> 00:55:55,856
By severing the line between
you and your man!

435
00:55:57,552 --> 00:55:58,571
How insolent!

436
00:55:59,171 --> 00:56:00,140
Mistress!

437
00:56:05,706 --> 00:56:07,326
Have you lost your senses?!

438
00:56:07,327 --> 00:56:11,063
No, Madame.
I'm very serious.

439
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:15,291
While you pledge your all
to Mr. Tamiya...

440
00:56:15,292 --> 00:56:18,464
you no longer reside in his heart.

441
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,757
No! Don't!

442
00:56:35,345 --> 00:56:40,483
Forgive me. I'm so sorry.
Let me explain...

443
00:56:41,686 --> 00:56:47,426
Your husband told me to do this.

444
00:56:51,951 --> 00:56:56,876
What? My husband put you
up to this?

445
00:56:56,877 --> 00:57:00,758
If you don't believe me...

446
00:57:01,408 --> 00:57:07,303
look at your face in the mirror.

447
00:57:07,863 --> 00:57:10,677
Do it now.

448
00:57:11,245 --> 00:57:13,171
My face...?

449
00:57:43,874 --> 00:57:51,431
Is this... really me?
This horror?!

450
00:57:58,113 --> 00:58:00,891
What's happened to me?

451
00:58:04,141 --> 00:58:13,063
Oiwa - your husband and Ito,
your neighbour, are responsible.

452
00:58:13,064 --> 00:58:17,331
They said it was medicine.

453
00:58:17,332 --> 00:58:20,771
It was actually poison.

454
00:58:20,772 --> 00:58:27,195
He schemed to have me commit adultery with you.

455
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:30,050
Both want to get rid of you,

456
00:58:30,085 --> 00:58:34,987
then that shopkeeper's daughter can
marry your samurai husband.

457
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:39,538
How vicious a plot!

458
00:58:42,641 --> 00:58:45,605
They intended to kill me.

459
00:58:45,606 --> 00:58:51,640
While I still draw breath,
I'll have my revenge.

460
00:58:56,542 --> 00:58:58,459
Curse them!

461
00:59:02,603 --> 00:59:05,431
No! Not like this.

462
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,485
You're too crazed just now.

463
00:59:10,486 --> 00:59:15,548
You'll worsen your illness.
Calm down first.

464
00:59:23,021 --> 00:59:25,193
Yes, I must look neat.

465
00:59:27,751 --> 00:59:33,578
I must comb my hair and
blacken my teeth.

466
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:41,436
Takuetsu, would you be so good as to
bring my teeth-blackening things?

467
00:59:41,437 --> 00:59:44,853
You really shouldn't.
You've just given birth.

468
00:59:44,854 --> 00:59:46,224
That doesn't matter.

469
00:59:50,121 --> 00:59:51,663
Bring them now!

470
01:00:00,802 --> 01:00:12,821
<i># How the bamboo hedge... #</i>

471
01:00:16,892 --> 01:00:26,944
<i># has now grown to become... #</i>

472
01:00:26,945 --> 01:00:35,925
<i># as untamed as the grass is wild. #</i>

473
01:00:38,376 --> 01:00:49,685
<i># Even when sheltered by an eave, #</i>

474
01:00:49,686 --> 01:00:59,704
<i># the wild grass will ne'er
deign to wither. #</i>

475
01:01:22,216 --> 01:01:24,064
You're bleeding!

476
01:01:39,486 --> 01:01:40,495
Takuetsu!

477
01:01:42,002 --> 01:01:43,293
Stay right there!

478
01:01:56,639 --> 01:01:58,699
I've caught you red-handed.

479
01:02:03,513 --> 01:02:07,718
Now you and Oiwa have to die.

480
01:02:09,293 --> 01:02:14,806
If you must kill someone,
kill him.

481
01:02:17,585 --> 01:02:21,835
Yes, I forgot...
He's still in the cellar.

482
01:02:44,251 --> 01:02:49,656
You must have heard everything, eh?

483
01:02:50,727 --> 01:02:55,098
That's good... very good.

484
01:03:09,533 --> 01:03:11,069
Put them down.

485
01:04:01,126 --> 01:04:03,283
Come on. Hurry up.

486
01:04:24,173 --> 01:04:25,139
Coming!

487
01:04:41,674 --> 01:04:44,343
Good morning.
What's wrong?

488
01:04:47,496 --> 01:04:51,761
My son still hasn't returned home.
I'm getting worried.

489
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:53,311
That is unusual.

490
01:04:53,312 --> 01:04:56,054
He's not a child -
no need to worry.

491
01:04:56,055 --> 01:04:58,691
But it's not like him.
Sit down here.

492
01:05:07,942 --> 01:05:10,928
You scared me.
How did you get in?

493
01:05:10,929 --> 01:05:14,776
Kohei is in the back.

494
01:05:14,777 --> 01:05:16,698
Really? He's here?

495
01:05:19,709 --> 01:05:23,341
- Yes, it's him all right.
- Really?

496
01:05:28,783 --> 01:05:34,371
Oiwa, are you better now?
How's the boy doing?

497
01:07:33,891 --> 01:07:38,168
Oume, sorry to have kept
you waiting.

498
01:07:42,990 --> 01:07:44,626
Show me your face.

499
01:07:48,168 --> 01:07:49,016
Who's there?

500
01:07:59,326 --> 01:08:01,961
Oh, it's you, Naosuke.

501
01:08:04,122 --> 01:08:10,059
Tamiya, you're a real shrewd one,
aren't you?

502
01:08:11,890 --> 01:08:14,756
Chop off my head and I'd still live!

503
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:18,339
What do you want here, Naosuke?

504
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:22,522
You should know... hush money.

505
01:08:25,336 --> 01:08:26,963
Are you sure?

506
01:08:26,964 --> 01:08:28,865
Husband, some money.

507
01:08:51,973 --> 01:08:57,271
Tamiya, you can trust me:
I'll never mention this to a soul.

508
01:08:57,306 --> 01:09:00,341
You can count on me.

509
01:09:29,267 --> 01:09:31,661
There's just the two of us here.

510
01:09:33,732 --> 01:09:37,456
No need to hide anymore.
We're married now.

511
01:09:44,632 --> 01:09:49,660
Oume... turn around and let
me look at you.

512
01:09:51,943 --> 01:09:53,135
Yes, husband.

513
01:09:54,672 --> 01:09:56,762
We will always be together...

514
01:09:57,896 --> 01:09:59,107
forever...

515
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:11,359
Oiwa! Go to your grave!

516
01:10:19,976 --> 01:10:22,201
What have I done?!

517
01:10:35,669 --> 01:10:37,330
What's wrong with you?

518
01:10:37,697 --> 01:10:40,697
Big trouble!
Where's your master?

519
01:10:41,772 --> 01:10:46,433
He was tired,
so he went back to his room.

520
01:10:48,838 --> 01:10:51,445
Tamiya! Why are you carrying a sword?

521
01:10:57,673 --> 01:11:00,108
Mr. Tamiya, please! No!

522
01:11:20,005 --> 01:11:23,859
<i>Give me the medicine...</i>

523
01:12:38,847 --> 01:12:41,430
<i>For rent</i>

524
01:12:41,465 --> 01:12:43,128
Where is Takuetsu?

525
01:12:43,163 --> 01:12:46,568
Where is his lady stall-keeper?

526
01:12:46,603 --> 01:12:48,851
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do.

527
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:51,723
You're choking me!

528
01:12:53,062 --> 01:12:57,030
He went to Yotsuya,
but had some trouble there.

529
01:12:57,030 --> 01:12:59,619
I hear he's working in Fukagawa.

530
01:12:59,650 --> 01:13:01,556
Fukagawa, you say? Good!

531
01:13:38,206 --> 01:13:40,397
It's filthy. What is it?

532
01:13:44,304 --> 01:13:47,760
A tortoise shell comb.
That's a good catch!

533
01:15:08,682 --> 01:15:11,682
Excuse me, can I get a light?

534
01:15:11,682 --> 01:15:13,651
Sure. Here you are.

535
01:15:29,139 --> 01:15:31,166
It's been a while.

536
01:15:33,431 --> 01:15:38,754
It is a rare and good chance to find
you here, Tamiya Iyemon.

537
01:15:38,754 --> 01:15:44,551
I must extract vengeance for my
sister-in-law, Oiwa.

538
01:15:44,586 --> 01:15:48,363
That's what I should say!
But how've you been?

539
01:15:50,498 --> 01:15:52,613
Since then...

540
01:15:55,226 --> 01:15:58,446
I lost all chance of promotion.

541
01:15:59,116 --> 01:16:02,612
Everything goes against my wishes.

542
01:16:02,613 --> 01:16:04,918
Where do you live now?

543
01:16:06,495 --> 01:16:09,986
In a temple in Honjo.

544
01:16:11,886 --> 01:16:14,745
To ward away the evil luck
that dogs me.

545
01:16:52,368 --> 01:16:54,045
It's freezing outside!

546
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:56,559
It must have been cold out.

547
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:00,704
I didn't catch much,
then it started to snow.

548
01:17:00,739 --> 01:17:04,068
The only thing I did get was this.

549
01:17:05,144 --> 01:17:08,489
Put it in the basin.
I'll wash it.

550
01:17:10,484 --> 01:17:14,641
It's excellent quality;
it should fetch a good price.

551
01:17:20,547 --> 01:17:23,062
It's unusually cold today.

552
01:17:28,464 --> 01:17:30,092
That'll do it.

553
01:17:33,702 --> 01:17:37,725
I need something hot:
warm up some sake.

554
01:17:38,019 --> 01:17:43,811
I tried to buy some,
but our credit has run out.

555
01:17:44,802 --> 01:17:50,421
The gods haven't deserted us.
Look, I can sell this.

556
01:17:51,248 --> 01:17:52,741
Where did you get it?

557
01:17:53,190 --> 01:17:54,562
The river, like always.

558
01:17:55,719 --> 01:17:58,838
This used to be my mother's comb.

559
01:17:58,839 --> 01:18:01,691
My sister, Oiwa, had it.

560
01:18:01,692 --> 01:18:05,641
Well... there must be many
similar ones.

561
01:18:05,642 --> 01:18:09,188
You must promise never to sell it!

562
01:18:12,058 --> 01:18:18,567
All right. As usual,
I'll do whatever you say.

563
01:18:23,604 --> 01:18:27,344
The rice and soup are hot.
Come have dinner.

564
01:18:28,594 --> 01:18:30,946
Look - not much of a catch.

565
01:18:56,239 --> 01:18:59,956
It'll fetch a good price.
I'd better do it now.

566
01:19:13,838 --> 01:19:15,323
What are you doing?

567
01:19:15,324 --> 01:19:17,339
A hand grabbed me!

568
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:27,512
This is my sister's undergarment.

569
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:47,686
Naosuke! You told me my sister was
punished for adultery.

570
01:19:48,281 --> 01:19:53,371
This comb and these clothes
are all my sister's.

571
01:19:53,372 --> 01:19:58,115
I don't believe she did it.
Tell me the truth.

572
01:19:59,683 --> 01:20:02,272
Hey, masseur!

573
01:20:02,273 --> 01:20:05,495
Naosuke, are you truly protecting me?

574
01:20:05,496 --> 01:20:10,429
Of course I am.
Actually, I'm the only one...

575
01:20:18,305 --> 01:20:20,800
Good evening.
Thank you for calling me.

576
01:20:24,128 --> 01:20:25,588
It's you!

577
01:20:28,902 --> 01:20:30,119
It is...!

578
01:20:34,439 --> 01:20:35,693
How have you been?

579
01:20:35,694 --> 01:20:38,358
Yes... quite a surprise.

580
01:20:38,359 --> 01:20:40,871
- A long time.
- Indeed.

581
01:20:41,326 --> 01:20:45,970
It's a small world.
A man has to be careful.

582
01:20:47,395 --> 01:20:49,988
Anyway, let me begin.

583
01:20:58,507 --> 01:20:59,515
That comb!

584
01:20:59,516 --> 01:21:01,872
You know something?!

585
01:21:03,018 --> 01:21:07,356
I can never forget it.
It was Oiwa's.

586
01:21:08,278 --> 01:21:09,681
What happened to her?

587
01:21:09,682 --> 01:21:12,384
- She was murdered!
- By whom?

588
01:21:12,385 --> 01:21:16,134
Her husband - that samurai, Tamiya.

589
01:21:18,672 --> 01:21:22,909
I shudder to remember it.
I can't stay!

590
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:34,541
This was Oiwa's kimono!

591
01:21:41,755 --> 01:21:42,833
Tell me everything!

592
01:21:50,116 --> 01:21:53,693
Osode! I'll tell you the whole story.

593
01:21:59,685 --> 01:22:02,081
Takuetsu! Stop!

594
01:22:06,048 --> 01:22:08,276
Forgive me. Help!

595
01:22:10,602 --> 01:22:13,413
Takuetsu, I need to ask you.

596
01:22:19,415 --> 01:22:24,068
Osode, I'll tell you everything.
Listen to me.

597
01:22:24,068 --> 01:22:25,233
Osode!

598
01:22:26,477 --> 01:22:31,067
I missed you so much.
I'm so happy.

599
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:34,137
I really missed you.

600
01:22:37,554 --> 01:22:39,841
What's the matter? Tell me.

601
01:22:41,095 --> 01:22:44,647
Listen... My father has given
his consent.

602
01:22:45,001 --> 01:22:48,365
Even my mother was happy about it.

603
01:22:49,535 --> 01:22:53,604
What's upsetting you?
I'll never leave you again.

604
01:22:53,605 --> 01:22:54,964
Yomoshichi?

605
01:23:05,591 --> 01:23:10,318
My God! What have we done?

606
01:23:15,933 --> 01:23:19,430
I've told you everything.
Now kill me.

607
01:23:19,588 --> 01:23:23,200
One failure in life is enough
for me. Do it!

608
01:23:23,201 --> 01:23:28,792
No, I've got one more thing
to ask you, Naosuke.

609
01:23:28,793 --> 01:23:31,796
Eh? More questions?

610
01:23:31,797 --> 01:23:36,588
Where is Tamiya Iyemon,
the man who killed my sister?

611
01:23:36,589 --> 01:23:39,960
I can't tell you that.
Even outlaws have a code.

612
01:23:42,956 --> 01:23:49,564
Osode, the very cause of my failure is
that I truly fell in love with you.

613
01:23:51,199 --> 01:23:55,114
Now he's found you again,
it's no use.

614
01:23:55,916 --> 01:24:00,900
I'm beginning to regret all
the things I did.

615
01:24:01,652 --> 01:24:04,575
But... evil men have no regrets.

616
01:24:04,884 --> 01:24:07,984
Do it! Kill me now.

617
01:24:09,790 --> 01:24:11,596
Naosuke, prepare to die!

618
01:24:17,393 --> 01:24:18,861
Enough jokes!

619
01:24:19,266 --> 01:24:23,552
Naosuke - you'll not stake your life
for a chance?

620
01:24:23,553 --> 01:24:26,277
Hmmm? A chance for what?

621
01:24:26,278 --> 01:24:28,489
For your love, Osode.

622
01:24:29,430 --> 01:24:30,440
Yomoshichi!

623
01:24:30,441 --> 01:24:31,915
I'll stake mine.

624
01:24:32,253 --> 01:24:37,476
Let's you and I together kill Tamiya.

625
01:24:38,078 --> 01:24:40,876
Either of us could survive,

626
01:24:40,876 --> 01:24:43,887
or we both might die.
Let us fight!

627
01:24:43,888 --> 01:24:46,559
Trust our lives to our swords.

628
01:24:48,775 --> 01:24:51,015
I like that. Let's do it!

629
01:27:14,104 --> 01:27:15,736
Stop haunting me!

630
01:27:18,712 --> 01:27:20,296
Stop this agony!

631
01:27:23,663 --> 01:27:26,630
<i>Give me the medicine.</i>

632
01:27:28,282 --> 01:27:32,381
<i>Tamiya, give me the medicine.</i>

633
01:27:33,132 --> 01:27:38,060
<i>Give me the medicine.
Give me the medicine.</i>

634
01:27:39,366 --> 01:27:42,328
I'll give you this!

635
01:27:46,860 --> 01:27:49,800
It always starts out like this!

636
01:28:38,658 --> 01:28:43,563
Iyemon Tamiya! I've come to avenge
my father and sister.

637
01:28:43,563 --> 01:28:47,121
I have joined her quest!

638
01:28:51,839 --> 01:28:57,083
All right... I understand.

639
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:01,857
Why are you here?

640
01:29:01,857 --> 01:29:07,665
I refute you,
and take the side of Osode.

641
01:29:07,700 --> 01:29:12,207
Interesting... you'll regret it.

642
01:29:18,739 --> 01:29:23,544
I'll send the three of you to hell.

643
01:29:28,875 --> 01:29:30,294
Come on!

644
01:29:43,171 --> 01:29:44,995
Protect Tamiya!

645
01:30:43,436 --> 01:30:48,293
Stop running away!
Go back and get them.

646
01:31:13,822 --> 01:31:16,319
Osode, you're mine now!

647
01:31:17,949 --> 01:31:19,328
All mine!

648
01:31:28,594 --> 01:31:30,044
Osode!

649
01:31:30,916 --> 01:31:33,721
The final cut!

650
01:31:35,088 --> 01:31:38,659
Osode... do it.

651
01:31:42,547 --> 01:31:43,647
Hurry!

652
01:32:05,363 --> 01:32:12,362
Naosuke... this life had nothing
good in it...

653
01:33:02,878 --> 01:33:04,231
Elder sister!

654
01:33:10,247 --> 01:33:11,777
Dearest sister!

655
01:34:04,546 --> 01:34:07,720
The End

656
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:11,238
