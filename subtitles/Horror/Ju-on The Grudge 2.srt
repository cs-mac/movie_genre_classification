1
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,599
Ju-On is the curse of a person
who died with a deep grudge.

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,499
This grudge is accumulated in the place where
that person lived and becomes its "Karma".

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,750
Whoever gets in contact with this curse
loses his life and a new curse is born.

4
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,079
This noon at around 12:10...

5
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,429
in the prefecture Suginami, Tokyo,
in the residence of Yoshieki Matsuoka...

6
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:50,550
the corpses of Yoshieki, his wife Mariko
and their son Takashi had been found.

7
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:05,819
Mr. Matsuoka, Mariko and Takashi had lost
pints of blood because of exterior injuries.

8
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,020
Numerous wounds on the dead bodies...

9
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:19,349
Foul play is suspected in those deaths.

10
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,190
In the afternoon of the same day
the investigations were...

11
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,240
It seems to happen in
the night of the 21st...

12
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,819
Until further details should be revealed,

13
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,880
every piece of evidence of this case
suggests a crime of passion.

14
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:57,050
Matsuoka, as their neighbors
have described, was...

15
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:14,150
Ju-On: Girl in Black

16
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,629
Yes, yes.

17
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,450
That cruel family massacre.

18
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,220
I'm standing right in front of
the house where it happened.

19
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,900
It's so scary here!

20
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,590
What? Me?

21
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,600
Are you crazy? I don't do things like that.

22
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,210
But say: Do you come today?

23
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:53,960
[Tetsuya]

24
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,240
Hello.

25
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,440
So she DOES have a lover.

26
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,630
Shit!

27
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,790
What's that?

28
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,510
I don't hear anything.

29
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,579
But it's true.

30
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,999
Have you eavesdropped on your neighbor?

31
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,389
Definitely not.

32
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,679
So, how's your neighbor?

33
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,979
I've already seen her, she's really beautiful.

34
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,789
So what's her job?

35
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,970
She's a nurse.

36
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,109
Unfortunately, I think you don't
have a chance with her, Tetsuya.

37
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,030
That's not what I'm talking about.

38
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,330
She's really strange.

39
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,779
Yuko.

40
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,459
What's wrong with you?

41
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,660
Yuko?

42
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,149
Are you already on a first-name basis?

43
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,020
Hey, say:

44
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,859
That family massacre happened here, right?

45
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,159
The neighbor.

46
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,079
Yes, so what?

47
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,929
Maybe she's the culprit.

48
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:07,950
What?

49
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,409
No way.

50
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,179
Exactly.

51
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,359
It's possible that a lady in white was the culprit.

52
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,249
Right?

53
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,029
Yes, and in the hospital she...

54
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:21,709
had been molested by a doctor and then she killed him or so.

55
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,490
How scary.

56
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,459
We'll look after your apartment till
you're back from your part time job.

57
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,669
But don't do anything strange here.

58
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,739
Don't worry. Just go.

59
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,219
See you.

60
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,580
Bye.

61
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,320
Come here.

62
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,109
No, not in his apartment.

63
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,690
Why not?

64
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,370
Yuko?

65
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,420
Are you OK?

66
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,819
What?

67
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,409
I've heard a strange voice...

68
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,800
You just worry too much...

69
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:09,370
[Yuko]

70
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,640
Fukie.

71
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,000
Are you doing that nonsense again?

72
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,270
How's your mother?

73
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,670
She was here before, but she said,
she's still got work to do.

74
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,940
I see.
Your mother does work really hard.

75
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,940
You should really model yourself on her.

76
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,229
And now put on your pajamas.

77
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,230
Hey...

78
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,120
For how long do I need to stay here?

79
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,339
Well... I don't know that, too.

80
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,170
We don't have the results of
the follow-up examination yet.

81
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,630
What's wrong with me?

82
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,400
My body?

83
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,310
My head?

84
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,670
It can't be anything serious
if you're still feeling so good.

85
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,240
I know it.

86
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,800
I'm going to die soon.

87
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,880
I see. So...

88
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,390
She's now in an age where
children imagine such things...

89
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,909
So, please continue to look after her.

90
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,140
She's got accustomed to you, I think.

91
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,869
Yes, sure.

92
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,900
You can send her mother home now.

93
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,040
Call her when we've got the results
of the follow-up examination.

94
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,970
You may go now, Mrs. Yokota.

95
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,719
I'll call it a day.

96
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,819
Yes, have a nice evening.

97
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,940
Bye.

98
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,740
What?

99
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,400
See? There's nothing.

100
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,130
Sorry to wake you up.

101
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,860
Sleep tight.

102
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,560
Hello.

103
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,240
Yuko.

104
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,130
Are you on your way home?

105
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,550
Yes.

106
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,830
I'm on the way to my part time job.

107
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,210
I see.

108
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,760
Good luck!

109
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,470
Are you OK?

110
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,229
What?

111
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,320
Are you dreaming?

112
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,180
Sorry.

113
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,589
Would you please switch
supervising room 3035 with me?

114
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,680
What?

115
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,000
Fukie's room?

116
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,259
Do you still worry about it?

117
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,819
Well...

118
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,719
Fukie likes you most. She would be very sad.

119
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,550
Don't worry...

120
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,660
Fukie...

121
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,890
Stop that nonsense!

122
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:59,740
[Ayano]

123
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,689
Scary, isn't it?

124
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:14,300
These are hard times we're living in.

125
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,280
Maybe an accident...

126
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,460
Or was it a crime?

127
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,719
Oh... sorry...

128
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,609
Please stop at the next traffic light.

129
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,459
On this side?

130
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,249
Understood.

131
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,170
Don't you need to go further?

132
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:36,110
It's OK, it's not far from here.

133
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,010
Aya...

134
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,249
How is it?

135
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,219
Can I offer you a drink?

136
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,710
I need to go to work tomorrow.

137
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,779
Here, the money for the taxi.

138
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,049
Oh, never mind!

139
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:01,990
But it was me who called the taxi.

140
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,340
Then...

141
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,879
Is this really OK?

142
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,349
Yes, see you tomorrow.

143
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,039
But be careful, it's very dark.

144
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,080
Thank you very much.

145
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:28,260
You're even more dangerous!

146
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,380
Boss?

147
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,570
Please answer!

148
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:36,120
[Fukie]

149
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,060
Miss teacher!

150
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,480
Fukie!

151
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:44,009
Are you OK?

152
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,540
How are you?

153
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,409
It was just a light anemia.

154
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,680
Are you OK now?

155
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,210
Dad is here!

156
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:17,570
Fukie! How are you?

157
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,300
How was work today?

158
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,150
There was nothing important to do, so I went earlier.

159
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,899
Have you already eaten, Fukie?

160
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,349
No, not yet.

161
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,510
Poor thing...

162
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,659
Didn't they let you eat?

163
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,569
So, shall we go out for food today?

164
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:37,889
Fukie collapsed in school today.

165
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,490
Really?

166
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,330
It was just a light anemia.

167
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:44,139
I see.

168
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,879
So, shall we go to the steak house?

169
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,209
Or do you want Yakiniku?

170
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:50,930
No, we'll eat here today.

171
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,330
But you can cook tomorrow.

172
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,960
It's always the same with you...

173
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:03,110
What did you say?

174
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,220
Fukie.

175
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,330
With these hands you're going to kill that woman.

176
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,690
Fukie...

177
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:08,920
Fukie...

178
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,990
Fukie...

179
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,880
Fukie...

180
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,620
Fukie...

181
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,900
Would you please come, Mrs. Yokota?

182
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,990
You wait here, Fukie. OK?

183
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:42,710
There seems to be nothing wrong with her brain.

184
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,040
Then...

185
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,080
It seems to be a psychic problem...

186
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,639
A psychic problem?

187
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,570
Caused by stress in her familiar surroundings.

188
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:03,410
This happens often with children at her age.

189
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,350
OK, let's start, Fukie.

190
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,180
There's no need to be nervous.

191
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,930
Relax.

192
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,200
Take a deep breath.

193
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,610
Look at my hand.

194
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:41,940
And while you're doing that,
you'll listen to my voice, yes?

195
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,839
You don't need to talk.

196
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,770
Just answer within your heart.

197
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,630
Relax.

198
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:56,600
Imagine...

199
00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:01,110
that you're floating on a big, big ocean.

200
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,840
Your body...

201
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:06,780
is sinking down in the ocean.

202
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,690
it's not difficult to breath.

203
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,610
You're feeling much lighter than before.

204
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,730
you're sinking deeper and deeper...

205
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:25,940
and you're getting close to
the bottom of this deep ocean.

206
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,500
And your memories...

207
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:34,870
reach back to a time when you were much smaller.

208
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,120
How old are you now?

209
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:44,880
I.. am... 5...

210
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,590
You're 5, yes?

211
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,250
What do you see?

212
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,120
A beach.

213
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,150
What are you doing there?

214
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:04,820
I'm swimming with mum and dad in the sea.

215
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:08,240
So you're swimming in the sea.

216
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,490
It's fun.

217
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:19,520
Let's return to a time
when you were even smaller.

218
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,840
You're now...

219
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,940
inside the womb of your mother.

220
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,600
What do you see?

221
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,809
What?

222
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:45,150
Relax.

223
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,880
Relax!

224
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,420
Relax!

225
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,579
Fukie, answer!

226
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,499
Doctor!

227
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,120
Relax, Fukie!

228
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,910
Fukie!

229
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:10,120
Why didn't you give birth to me?

230
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,630
Would you please come, Mrs. Yokota?

231
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,820
We now have the results
of the follow-up examination.

232
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,400
This here...

233
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:40,590
is on the side of Fukie's mons pubis.

234
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,680
It seems to be a cyst.

235
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,190
A cyst?

236
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,680
This is a really rare case...

237
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:52,829
Within the uterus they still were twins.

238
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,380
But for some reason...

239
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,920
one of them absorbed to
other one and grew up alone.

240
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:03,360
But he became a cyst and remained
inside the body of the other one.

241
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:10,070
Her twin became a part of her body
and was born that way.

242
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,190
Inside of Fukie's body...

243
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:18,850
Inside of the born twin, in Fukie...

244
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:22,079
the other one subsisted...

245
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,300
and grew up until today.

246
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:11,130
Sister...

247
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,310
What is it?

248
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,920
I wanted to talk to you about something...

249
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,950
About Fukie?

250
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:42,930
[Yokota]

251
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,200
Have you seen Ma?

252
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,529
My little Ma.

253
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,030
She's black and very cute.

254
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,250
Don't you know her?

255
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,040
I can't find her.

256
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,160
Let's look somewhere else.

257
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,100
Fujie!

258
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,650
It's me, Yokota.

259
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,210
Fujie!

260
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:58,820
Fujie!

261
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:23,730
Fujie!

262
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
What?

263
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,410
I couldn't get you on the phone.

264
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,680
I'm coming in.

265
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,290
Have you drunk something?

266
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,060
Maybe it's an inappropriate moment...

267
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,170
May I turn the lights on?

268
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:38,160
Let me go!

269
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:57,930
With these hands you're
going to kill that woman!

270
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:21,250
[Mariko]

271
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,390
Do you feel anything?

272
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:34,070
I can't tell on the basis of this video.

273
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:38,090
What did the doctors say?

274
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:42,380
They said she has a cyst.

275
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:48,130
Maybe you should ask some experts.

276
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,900
And I'm not that good anyways.

277
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,360
But it just won't become better.

278
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:56,080
I feel so sorry for her.

279
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:58,880
I can really understand you, but...

280
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:02,600
The cyst within her...

281
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,640
I had another daughter
to whom I didn't give birth.

282
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,730
I think this is the curse of that child!

283
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,700
That's why you're the only one
who can help her.

284
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,700
Please!

285
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,210
Help me!

286
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,269
Hey, mother...

287
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:27,720
Can I go play with Ken today?

288
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,660
Hey, Takashi! Say hello first!

289
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,690
How old is he?

290
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,190
He's already going to elementary school.

291
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,499
Won't you take the elevator?

292
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,400
No, an old habit.

293
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:33,180
Mariko!

294
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,110
Do you have a problem?

295
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,739
Thanks.

296
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,060
It's all right.

297
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:55,780
Who was that?

298
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:58,410
The nurse who's looking after Fukie.

299
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:00,770
I see.

300
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,000
Sister...

301
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,480
I'm sorry.

302
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:09,029
We'll leave it for today.

303
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:09,979
What?

304
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,499
I need to restart from the beginning.

305
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,200
Don't say that!

306
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:14,990
There's no point in doing it today.

307
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,209
In three days...

308
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:19,250
I'll be back in three days.

309
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,630
Understood.

310
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,470
But come under all circumstances!

311
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,440
Let's start.

312
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:29,200
Look at her!

313
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:36,360
It's over.

314
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,820
In Fukie...

315
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,580
was another soul...

316
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:20,090
besides her own one.

317
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:23,880
As you've said...

318
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:28,720
it was probably the cursed soul
of that unborn child.

319
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:42,330
Please pray for her.

320
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,210

See you, sister.

Wait for me.

00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:56,510
Who are you?

327
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:58,870
Fukie?

328
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:56,540
Fukie?

329
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:24,080
No.

330
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:27,240
You're not Fukie.

331
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,250
You've taken her place, haven't you?

332
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:39,720
and I've banished Fukie's soul.

333
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,230
Run away!

You hate us.
