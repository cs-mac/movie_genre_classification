1
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:14,871
<b>RUST AND BONE</b>

2
00:03:01,037 --> 00:03:02,791
I'm hungry.

3
00:03:05,495 --> 00:03:07,580
I'm hungry.

4
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:45,334
Want some?

5
00:03:54,495 --> 00:03:56,047
Stop it.

6
00:03:57,787 --> 00:03:59,422
I said stop it!

7
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,793
Sam!

8
00:05:11,287 --> 00:05:13,005
Come on, hurry!

9
00:05:17,537 --> 00:05:19,172
Tired?

10
00:05:25,912 --> 00:05:30,474
- You're Ali [<i>Alain</i>]?
- Yeah. Get in.

11
00:05:31,453 --> 00:05:32,840
You took your time!

12
00:05:32,995 --> 00:05:35,461
- I've been looking for an hour.
- Move over, move.

13
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,582
I called Anna.
I couldn't find you.

14
00:05:38,745 --> 00:05:40,334
You like my truck?

15
00:05:40,495 --> 00:05:42,580
You really do?

16
00:05:42,745 --> 00:05:45,755
I don't like boys
who don't like my truck!

17
00:05:46,912 --> 00:05:48,666
So you want it?

18
00:05:50,745 --> 00:05:52,629
You seem nice.

19
00:05:52,787 --> 00:05:54,706
Eight truckers laid off.

20
00:05:55,162 --> 00:05:57,081
So I talked it over with Anna.

21
00:05:57,245 --> 00:06:00,623
I decided to go independent.

22
00:06:00,787 --> 00:06:03,204
I bought this rig.

23
00:06:08,495 --> 00:06:09,917
What's that for?

24
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,963
To eat outside when it's nice.

25
00:06:12,537 --> 00:06:14,622
We get sun here.

26
00:06:14,787 --> 00:06:17,288
I'm still buckled in.

27
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:19,833
Look at this.

28
00:06:24,745 --> 00:06:28,419
See those dogs?
They're Aunt Anna's.

29
00:06:30,328 --> 00:06:32,083
Whose spare parts?

30
00:06:32,245 --> 00:06:34,213
Our neighbour's, Che.

31
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,704
He does repairs on the side.

32
00:06:37,953 --> 00:06:39,791
Lucky for us.

33
00:06:48,162 --> 00:06:49,880
Tell me when.

34
00:06:50,037 --> 00:06:52,087
Make you big and strong.

35
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,627
When you see your sister last?

36
00:06:55,037 --> 00:06:56,874
I don't know, 5 years.

37
00:06:57,037 --> 00:06:58,672
That long?

38
00:06:58,828 --> 00:07:00,417
What does she do?

39
00:07:00,578 --> 00:07:02,416
She works in a supermarket.

40
00:07:02,578 --> 00:07:05,708
- Cashier?
- Yeah, exactly.

41
00:07:08,912 --> 00:07:10,997
Not those! She'll kill you.

42
00:07:11,162 --> 00:07:12,963
On top. The most expired.

43
00:07:13,537 --> 00:07:16,168
Organised by date, top to bottom.

44
00:07:16,328 --> 00:07:18,129
- Those.
- Start on top.

45
00:07:18,287 --> 00:07:19,875
Want one?

46
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:23,250
Anna brings them from work.

47
00:07:24,537 --> 00:07:27,002
They throw them away
once they expire.

48
00:07:27,162 --> 00:07:30,089
But you can eat them for another week.

49
00:07:31,495 --> 00:07:33,379
Make a good living?

50
00:07:35,828 --> 00:07:38,755
- We manage to make ends meet.
- What do you do?

51
00:07:38,912 --> 00:07:40,334
Deliveries. Frozen food.

52
00:07:40,495 --> 00:07:43,706
Mostly fish, but other stuff too.

53
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,548
Depends on the loads I find.

54
00:07:47,703 --> 00:07:49,671
Want coffee?

55
00:07:50,328 --> 00:07:52,213
Yeah, sure.

56
00:08:13,078 --> 00:08:15,081
He looks like you.

57
00:08:20,537 --> 00:08:23,713
Some reunion!
No kiss for your brother?

58
00:08:30,328 --> 00:08:32,248
Just this, for him?

59
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:34,794
At least she packed his passport.

60
00:08:34,953 --> 00:08:37,999
Oh please,
she just forgot it was in there.

61
00:08:38,162 --> 00:08:40,840
They used the kid to smuggle drugs.

62
00:08:40,995 --> 00:08:42,335
No way.

63
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,545
She told me so herself.

64
00:08:46,703 --> 00:08:48,209
How will you tend to him?

65
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,954
I have no time. I work.

66
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,943
Richard too.

67
00:08:51,078 --> 00:08:53,247
Was he in school there?

68
00:08:53,578 --> 00:08:56,459
You don't even know?
You're killing me.

69
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,480
- Did you go to school at Mom's?
- Yes.

70
00:09:00,495 --> 00:09:03,292
I'll see if I can enrol him nearby.

71
00:09:03,453 --> 00:09:06,168
He needs clothes.
He can't go like this.

72
00:09:06,328 --> 00:09:08,497
I'll ask the neighbours.

73
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,255
Want to sleep?

74
00:09:13,412 --> 00:09:16,374
- Should I close the door?
- No need.

75
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,041
Here you go.

76
00:09:31,245 --> 00:09:33,497
Give him some.

77
00:09:34,453 --> 00:09:36,475
Gentle. I'll be back.

78
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:38,470
Don't hurt them.

79
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:40,421
He licked me.

80
00:09:40,578 --> 00:09:41,621
Don't open.

81
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,338
Want to come eat?

82
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,921
They're cute.

83
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,629
We know a breeder.

84
00:09:58,787 --> 00:10:03,587
He leaves them a month.
A little extra money.

85
00:10:03,745 --> 00:10:06,956
- You doing okay?
- I'm exhausted.

86
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:12,710
- That won't start.
- You'll see.

87
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,955
Don't trust appearances.

88
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,337
Fine to go to work.

89
00:10:17,495 --> 00:10:19,961
- You kidding?
- Not at all.

90
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,417
Che!

91
00:10:24,245 --> 00:10:25,501
Where's your toolbox?

92
00:10:25,662 --> 00:10:27,416
In the back.

93
00:10:27,578 --> 00:10:29,830
Can you give us a hand?

94
00:11:05,662 --> 00:11:07,416
When is Mom coming?

95
00:11:07,578 --> 00:11:09,830
Soon.

96
00:11:11,995 --> 00:11:13,547
When is Mom coming?

97
00:11:13,703 --> 00:11:15,753
Soon, I said.

98
00:11:17,745 --> 00:11:18,918
But when?

99
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,879
I don't know.

100
00:11:25,287 --> 00:11:27,088
What was your last job?

101
00:11:27,245 --> 00:11:30,090
Short time in a slaughterhouse.
It closed.

102
00:11:30,245 --> 00:11:31,999
Never in security?

103
00:11:32,162 --> 00:11:36,334
Assistant security guard
in a stadium for six months.

104
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:39,340
Night-watchman. In a parking lot, too.

105
00:11:39,745 --> 00:11:41,665
Ever do any combat sports?

106
00:11:41,828 --> 00:11:43,250
Boxing for six years.

107
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,672
Kick-boxing for two.

108
00:11:47,953 --> 00:11:49,589
Can you prove it?

109
00:11:49,745 --> 00:11:51,878
Pictures? Boxing permit?

110
00:11:52,037 --> 00:11:55,130
I won a regional championship
in Belgium.

111
00:11:55,745 --> 00:11:57,380
I have a belt.

112
00:11:58,537 --> 00:12:00,125
You quit?

113
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:01,839
The coach did.

114
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:04,080
- Why?
- He died.

115
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,457
You don't smoke?

116
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,209
You don't drink?

117
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,792
I didn't hear.

118
00:12:13,953 --> 00:12:16,668
- I don't drink.
- No drugs?

119
00:12:17,578 --> 00:12:19,463
One good reason to hire you?

120
00:12:22,912 --> 00:12:24,713
Trust me.

121
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,042
So?

122
00:12:33,203 --> 00:12:36,877
I'll call him next week.
Is that his son?

123
00:12:37,037 --> 00:12:39,336
You didn't mention the kid?

124
00:12:39,495 --> 00:12:41,664
I didn't ask.

125
00:12:44,203 --> 00:12:45,543
Your hands are cold.

126
00:12:55,537 --> 00:12:57,871
You win. Go on in.

127
00:12:58,037 --> 00:13:00,620
Four against one. Not fair.

128
00:13:00,787 --> 00:13:02,256
Enjoy!

129
00:13:05,787 --> 00:13:09,663
See? It's easy.
It doesn't matter what you say.

130
00:13:10,828 --> 00:13:12,582
Just so she remembers you.

131
00:13:12,745 --> 00:13:15,163
Bit of luck, they're drunk, depressed.

132
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,229
There you are. Nice guy.

133
00:13:17,287 --> 00:13:19,357
- Does it work?
- You bet.

134
00:13:42,037 --> 00:13:44,538
Step back, please.

135
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:54,756
You okay? Tilt your head back.

136
00:13:54,912 --> 00:13:58,088
Good. Take a few breaths.

137
00:13:59,453 --> 00:14:00,959
Asshole!

138
00:14:02,037 --> 00:14:03,921
Breathe.

139
00:14:04,662 --> 00:14:06,546
I have to get home.

140
00:14:06,995 --> 00:14:08,251
Any friends here?

141
00:14:08,412 --> 00:14:11,126
I came alone. I have my car.

142
00:14:11,662 --> 00:14:13,581
- You can't drive.
- I'm fine.

143
00:14:13,745 --> 00:14:14,788
I'll call a cab.

144
00:14:14,953 --> 00:14:17,454
I have my car. I need it.

145
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,663
You're sweet.

146
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:21,295
Bitch! Yeah, you, slut!

147
00:14:21,453 --> 00:14:22,793
What the fuck?

148
00:14:22,953 --> 00:14:24,505
Shut up!

149
00:14:25,328 --> 00:14:27,166
Shit.

150
00:14:28,203 --> 00:14:30,123
Still bleeding?

151
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:31,875
I'm fine.

152
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,172
You got hurt?

153
00:14:39,328 --> 00:14:41,829
It's starting to swell.

154
00:14:51,453 --> 00:14:53,456
Go to the Annex often?

155
00:14:56,287 --> 00:14:58,290
Why do you go alone?

156
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,707
To dance?

157
00:15:05,245 --> 00:15:06,288
To meet guys.

158
00:15:07,162 --> 00:15:08,501
Oh, yeah?

159
00:15:09,953 --> 00:15:12,585
You don't dress like that,
just to dance.

160
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,704
How am I dressed?

161
00:15:15,578 --> 00:15:17,416
I don't know.

162
00:15:18,537 --> 00:15:19,793
Look.

163
00:15:20,412 --> 00:15:21,454
And?

164
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,838
You're dressed like a whore.

165
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,798
Excuse me?

166
00:15:32,203 --> 00:15:34,502
- How do you call it?
- Enough.

167
00:15:36,453 --> 00:15:38,373
- No surprise you...
- Shut up.

168
00:15:44,245 --> 00:15:47,255
- How will you get back?
- No idea.

169
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,505
Forget it.

170
00:15:49,662 --> 00:15:52,245
- For a cab.
- Forget it, I said.

171
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:54,666
Good night, then.

172
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,583
Got any ice up there?

173
00:15:56,745 --> 00:15:59,127
- What?
- Ice cubes.

174
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,205
Wait. I'll go see.

175
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,254
I can come up.

176
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,876
Someone's up there.

177
00:16:07,037 --> 00:16:08,246
So what?

178
00:16:08,412 --> 00:16:10,628
So wait and I'll come back.

179
00:16:14,745 --> 00:16:16,416
Okay.

180
00:16:17,328 --> 00:16:18,715
Come on.

181
00:16:24,495 --> 00:16:27,457
- Steph?
- There's ice here.

182
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,126
What happened?

183
00:16:30,453 --> 00:16:31,663
There was a fight.

184
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:34,163
- But you're okay?
- Fine.

185
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:36,873
Who's he?

186
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,129
Bouncer from the Annex.

187
00:16:39,287 --> 00:16:42,214
The Annex?
Why the fuck were you there?

188
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,005
What are you looking for?

189
00:16:44,162 --> 00:16:45,631
Ice cubes.

190
00:16:45,787 --> 00:16:46,913
He hurt his hand.

191
00:16:48,162 --> 00:16:50,414
Can we talk for a minute?

192
00:17:20,995 --> 00:17:22,879
Get off my back!

193
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:26,288
Any better?

194
00:17:26,453 --> 00:17:28,005
Yeah, it is.

195
00:17:30,245 --> 00:17:32,828
Is that you with the whales?

196
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,207
Is it your job?

197
00:17:38,495 --> 00:17:40,829
I'd never have imagined!

198
00:17:40,995 --> 00:17:43,247
Surprised a whore can train orcas?

199
00:17:47,537 --> 00:17:49,089
You can go. You're done.

200
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,839
Talking to me?

201
00:17:56,703 --> 00:17:58,173
Go on, please.

202
00:18:00,787 --> 00:18:03,465
I left my number, if you need it.

203
00:18:16,078 --> 00:18:17,667
You okay?

204
00:18:21,537 --> 00:18:23,338
You're upset.

205
00:18:28,703 --> 00:18:30,588
I saw your face there.

206
00:18:30,745 --> 00:18:32,665
Where?

207
00:18:32,828 --> 00:18:34,962
With the bouncer.

208
00:18:36,287 --> 00:18:37,958
I saw how he shut you up.

209
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,709
I see. He shut me up.

210
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,873
Yeah, he shut you up.

211
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,454
No more orders, Simon.

212
00:18:45,912 --> 00:18:47,666
Meaning?

213
00:18:48,203 --> 00:18:50,669
No more orders, that's all.

214
00:23:16,787 --> 00:23:18,790
Get out. It's filthy.

215
00:23:23,745 --> 00:23:25,499
Get out. It's filthy.

216
00:23:37,412 --> 00:23:38,668
Get out.

217
00:23:43,037 --> 00:23:45,668
Damn it. You're filthy!

218
00:23:47,328 --> 00:23:48,620
Don't touch me.

219
00:23:48,787 --> 00:23:50,706
Move it. Anna!

220
00:23:51,662 --> 00:23:54,210
Take off your pants.

221
00:23:54,662 --> 00:23:56,665
You smell like shit.

222
00:23:56,828 --> 00:23:58,334
Lift your arms.

223
00:24:00,453 --> 00:24:02,005
Come here.

224
00:24:08,037 --> 00:24:09,921
Stay put!

225
00:24:11,453 --> 00:24:13,172
What are you doing?

226
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:15,663
- Where were you?
- Doing ljaundry.

227
00:24:15,828 --> 00:24:17,417
What the hell?

228
00:24:17,828 --> 00:24:19,250
Don't cry!

229
00:24:19,412 --> 00:24:20,703
Turn that thing off.

230
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:23,204
- Where's Anna?
- She went out.

231
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:25,380
Come shower, Sam.

232
00:24:27,453 --> 00:24:29,124
Stay out of there!

233
00:25:16,787 --> 00:25:18,541
Anyone here?

234
00:25:59,703 --> 00:26:01,090
Steph!

235
00:26:02,287 --> 00:26:03,792
Wait!

236
00:26:06,662 --> 00:26:09,506
What did you do with my legs?

237
00:26:22,495 --> 00:26:25,624
What did you do with my legs?

238
00:27:58,578 --> 00:28:00,712
Your brothers called.

239
00:28:01,578 --> 00:28:05,336
They asked for you,
but I thought it best to wait.

240
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,954
What would I have done?

241
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,040
Give that to me.

242
00:29:02,662 --> 00:29:04,747
Give it to me, now.

243
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:07,505
Please.

244
00:29:09,662 --> 00:29:12,245
What were you thinking?

245
00:30:06,745 --> 00:30:10,454
How about a little stroll?

246
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,753
I don't feel like it.

247
00:30:23,078 --> 00:30:24,465
Right!

248
00:30:25,537 --> 00:30:27,374
Good. Left!

249
00:30:27,537 --> 00:30:28,828
Left, right!

250
00:30:35,495 --> 00:30:37,379
Watch your guard.

251
00:30:51,995 --> 00:30:53,998
How you doing, Foued?

252
00:31:21,495 --> 00:31:22,917
How's it going?

253
00:31:42,203 --> 00:31:43,874
Hold on.

254
00:31:50,745 --> 00:31:53,044
<i>- You forgot Sam.</i>
- I'm at the gym.

255
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:55,965
<i>- The school called.</i>
- I'm going.

256
00:31:56,578 --> 00:31:57,965
<i>You kidding? You forgot...</i>

257
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,004
I said I'm going!

258
00:32:18,787 --> 00:32:21,832
Mr. Van Versch, may I talk to you?

259
00:32:23,578 --> 00:32:25,252
I know.
I'm sorry, ma'am.

260
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:26,381
I was at work.

261
00:32:26,412 --> 00:32:29,505
Look how late it is.
Third time in two weeks!

262
00:32:29,662 --> 00:32:32,707
Next time I'll have to call the police.

263
00:32:33,328 --> 00:32:34,999
Come here!

264
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,839
Move, god-damn it.

265
00:32:48,995 --> 00:32:50,038
Fucking pain!

266
00:32:50,203 --> 00:32:52,337
- Don't like dogs?
- Not him.

267
00:32:52,495 --> 00:32:53,881
He doesn't like assholes.

268
00:32:54,037 --> 00:32:55,672
Move!

269
00:32:55,828 --> 00:32:57,583
What's his problem?

270
00:32:57,745 --> 00:32:59,629
Fucking reeks, too.

271
00:33:21,495 --> 00:33:22,538
<i>All?</i>

272
00:33:22,703 --> 00:33:25,002
Yeah, it's me. Who's that?

273
00:33:25,995 --> 00:33:27,465
<i>Stephanie.</i>

274
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,376
<i>Remember me?</i>

275
00:33:29,537 --> 00:33:31,954
<i>We met at the Annex.
The fight, the ice.</i>

276
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,628
Stephanie, sure!
How are you?

277
00:33:36,912 --> 00:33:38,879
<i>You hear what happened?</i>

278
00:33:39,037 --> 00:33:41,454
I saw it on TV.

279
00:33:42,412 --> 00:33:45,457
<i>So how do you think I am?</i>

280
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,421
I don't know.

281
00:33:50,287 --> 00:33:52,041
<i>How about you?</i>

282
00:33:52,203 --> 00:33:54,004
The usual.

283
00:33:55,495 --> 00:33:57,296
<i>Still a bouncer?</i>

284
00:33:57,453 --> 00:34:00,997
No, a security guard.
Four nights a week.

285
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,709
I'm here.

286
00:34:58,037 --> 00:34:59,506
Come in.

287
00:35:03,578 --> 00:35:05,546
Been here for long?

288
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:07,837
Just got here.

289
00:35:08,162 --> 00:35:10,627
The doorbell wasn't you?

290
00:35:13,828 --> 00:35:15,334
Sit down.

291
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,583
Something to drink? Coffee?

292
00:35:24,495 --> 00:35:25,751
I just have instant.

293
00:35:25,912 --> 00:35:28,626
That's fine. Need any help?

294
00:35:34,953 --> 00:35:37,122
Have you been here long?

295
00:35:37,287 --> 00:35:39,206
It's been...

296
00:35:40,703 --> 00:35:41,829
two...

297
00:35:41,995 --> 00:35:44,673
three, four months I think.

298
00:35:44,828 --> 00:35:46,547
It's not bad here.

299
00:35:46,703 --> 00:35:49,418
It's temporary, because...

300
00:35:49,662 --> 00:35:51,546
I'll do it.

301
00:35:54,078 --> 00:35:56,496
Insurance pays for this.

302
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:59,953
No one comes to help you?

303
00:36:00,953 --> 00:36:03,252
Help me what, walk?

304
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,329
To clean up and stuff.

305
00:36:07,245 --> 00:36:10,456
Yeah, people come. Lots of them.

306
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,209
You okay?

307
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,004
Does it stink in here?

308
00:36:56,162 --> 00:36:57,797
A little.

309
00:36:59,162 --> 00:37:01,212
It's me who stinks.

310
00:37:06,037 --> 00:37:07,542
Let's go out.

311
00:37:13,203 --> 00:37:14,922
Come on. Get dressed.

312
00:37:15,078 --> 00:37:16,465
I won't go out.

313
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,458
I won't go out.

314
00:37:31,703 --> 00:37:33,374
Be careful.

315
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:49,045
Stop pushing or I'll puke.

316
00:37:49,203 --> 00:37:50,922
I'll do it.

317
00:38:48,037 --> 00:38:50,004
I want to take a dip.

318
00:38:52,162 --> 00:38:53,714
You don't want to?

319
00:38:55,953 --> 00:38:57,873
Why? No bathing suit?

320
00:39:02,537 --> 00:39:04,208
Do you even realize?

321
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:06,420
Who cares? No one's here.

322
00:39:10,787 --> 00:39:12,955
I'm going.

323
00:40:33,412 --> 00:40:35,249
I think I will go in.

324
00:40:35,412 --> 00:40:36,834
Really?

325
00:40:39,078 --> 00:40:40,335
Can I have a towel?

326
00:41:12,828 --> 00:41:14,085
I'm done.

327
00:41:19,995 --> 00:41:21,584
How do I do this?

328
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:23,380
You have to carry me.

329
00:41:23,995 --> 00:41:25,038
Hang on.

330
00:41:47,203 --> 00:41:48,958
Don't let go too fast.

331
00:41:52,162 --> 00:41:53,714
You okay?

332
00:43:29,287 --> 00:43:31,254
Fuck, this feels good.

333
00:43:36,162 --> 00:43:37,833
Thanks.

334
00:45:12,703 --> 00:45:14,789
I won't need these.

335
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,040
Garbage.

336
00:45:21,912 --> 00:45:22,954
Garbage.

337
00:45:24,037 --> 00:45:26,205
There's nice stuff here.

338
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:28,043
This for example.

339
00:45:28,203 --> 00:45:30,502
You can wear it over pants.

340
00:45:33,995 --> 00:45:36,212
You liked this.

341
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:38,503
You liked this dress.

342
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:41,291
It's for you.

343
00:45:53,287 --> 00:45:54,087
I'll keep this one.

344
00:45:55,703 --> 00:45:58,086
See those fists.

345
00:45:58,245 --> 00:45:59,999
Damn! Look at that.

346
00:46:00,162 --> 00:46:02,461
I fought him before.

347
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:04,255
Twice at nationals.

348
00:46:04,412 --> 00:46:05,621
Damn good fighter.

349
00:46:06,537 --> 00:46:08,255
Knee, right.

350
00:46:08,412 --> 00:46:10,545
One right is all it takes.

351
00:46:15,412 --> 00:46:16,454
What do you want?

352
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,339
To come in.

353
00:46:18,953 --> 00:46:19,996
Who's he?

354
00:46:21,537 --> 00:46:23,006
Are you Martial?

355
00:46:23,162 --> 00:46:26,540
The boss mentioned him.
He's with the company.

356
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:56,457
Check this out.

357
00:46:56,620 --> 00:47:01,206
Two rights, then again. He's 200 lbs.

358
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:04,629
- He's not 200.
- At least 190.

359
00:47:07,953 --> 00:47:10,798
They should stop.
Why don't they stop?

360
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,378
Knee, knee.

361
00:47:13,537 --> 00:47:15,456
And again.

362
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:18,121
- Like that?
- What?

363
00:47:18,287 --> 00:47:20,835
- Fights.
- Yeah.

364
00:47:21,787 --> 00:47:25,081
- Can you fight?
- A Little, yeah.

365
00:47:25,787 --> 00:47:27,505
Ever fight?

366
00:47:27,662 --> 00:47:30,755
A long time ago.
I boxed. Kick-boxing too.

367
00:47:31,912 --> 00:47:35,005
Want to make some money? Fighting?

368
00:47:35,578 --> 00:47:37,130
You shitting me?

369
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:41,245
A guy organizes fights
near Nice, a gypsy.

370
00:47:41,412 --> 00:47:43,960
Betting, money.

371
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,542
How do you know him?

372
00:47:46,537 --> 00:47:50,460
I put cameras in a garage
he stole some Mercedes from.

373
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:53,879
We met when he wanted the tapes.

374
00:47:58,703 --> 00:48:00,457
What kind of boxing?

375
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:03,500
Like Kick-boxing? You use your feet?

376
00:48:03,662 --> 00:48:06,956
We use everything. Elbows, knees...

377
00:48:08,287 --> 00:48:10,503
We fuck each other up, bad.

378
00:48:11,662 --> 00:48:13,629
Last man standing wins.

379
00:48:13,787 --> 00:48:15,920
You're strangling me.

380
00:48:20,828 --> 00:48:23,294
First time doing it?

381
00:48:25,203 --> 00:48:26,625
Not scared?

382
00:48:26,787 --> 00:48:28,754
Scared of what?

383
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,672
How much do you get?

384
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:38,787
I don't know, 500, 1000.

385
00:48:38,953 --> 00:48:41,003
Depends if I win.

386
00:48:41,703 --> 00:48:43,339
You fight for 500?

387
00:48:45,245 --> 00:48:48,456
Get tuned up,
put your health at stake, for 500?

388
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:51,170
My health at stake?
Don't overstate it.

389
00:48:55,412 --> 00:48:56,798
I can give you 500.

390
00:48:58,037 --> 00:49:00,620
Cancel. I'll pay you tomorrow.

391
00:49:00,787 --> 00:49:03,916
If you're loaded, sure.
But I said I'd do it.

392
00:49:06,953 --> 00:49:08,754
If it's not the money, then why?

393
00:49:08,912 --> 00:49:11,922
- I never said it's not the money.
- So why?

394
00:49:12,078 --> 00:49:13,469
What a pain!

395
00:49:13,703 --> 00:49:16,500
Why? To fight. For the fun of it.

396
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:19,838
Like you and your fish. Why?
Because it's fun.

397
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:23,501
The money and the fun.

398
00:49:23,662 --> 00:49:25,084
See how I ended up?

399
00:49:25,828 --> 00:49:27,831
Spare me.

400
00:49:30,787 --> 00:49:32,920
Where's your stroller?

401
00:49:34,453 --> 00:49:36,954
If you go to your fight...

402
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,205
you think I can come?

403
00:49:59,412 --> 00:50:04,295
Two casts for two prosthetic devices.
To get you walking.

404
00:50:04,787 --> 00:50:07,667
After the sockets,
we'll choose the knees.

405
00:50:07,828 --> 00:50:10,127
Hydraulic, pneumatic, electronic.

406
00:50:10,287 --> 00:50:11,792
Electronic knees?

407
00:50:11,953 --> 00:50:15,711
You don't have to think.
It positions itself.

408
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:17,162
Do the feet move?

409
00:50:17,328 --> 00:50:19,960
No, they don't. They're carbon blades.

410
00:50:20,495 --> 00:50:22,628
Flexible, but don't move.

411
00:50:22,787 --> 00:50:26,496
- I'll walk like a robot?
- No, just fine.

412
00:50:26,662 --> 00:50:29,423
There are feet,
not covered by insurance...

413
00:50:29,578 --> 00:50:34,330
that can give you heels
0.4 to 2 inches high.

414
00:50:34,495 --> 00:50:36,877
For women it's important.

415
00:50:44,703 --> 00:50:46,255
Damn!

416
00:50:55,787 --> 00:50:58,204
You can go. I'll take a cab.

417
00:50:58,870 --> 00:50:59,961
I don't mind.

418
00:51:31,912 --> 00:51:35,206
Take Sam for five minutes.
The breeder's here.

419
00:51:40,745 --> 00:51:42,665
Can you watch your son?

420
00:51:42,828 --> 00:51:45,294
- Yeah, sure.
- Keep him inside, okay?

421
00:51:45,453 --> 00:51:47,172
<i>...competing since 2009.</i>

422
00:51:47,328 --> 00:51:52,164
<i>But that doesn't mean he's not been training,
so obviously we can expect...</i>

423
00:51:52,328 --> 00:51:54,248
Go to Daddy. Stay with him.

424
00:51:55,203 --> 00:51:56,495
Stay put.

425
00:51:56,662 --> 00:51:58,499
Your hands are cold.

426
00:51:59,453 --> 00:52:02,001
<i>Driving Luke Wise backup
against the cages.</i>

427
00:52:02,162 --> 00:52:04,544
<i>Seem to remember
a bit of judo background...</i>

428
00:52:04,703 --> 00:52:05,746
Don't touch.

429
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:09,039
<i>...is a judo extraordinaire.</i>

430
00:52:09,203 --> 00:52:11,835
<i>Famous for judo
in his home country of Romania.</i>

431
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:16,084
<i>Not only is he dangerous on the ground,
but he can strike effectively...</i>

432
00:52:16,245 --> 00:52:18,627
<i>so you have more things
to worry about</i>

433
00:52:19,203 --> 00:52:20,246
See him?

434
00:52:21,328 --> 00:52:24,090
- Look how strong he is.
- Who?

435
00:52:24,245 --> 00:52:26,711
The guy in black.

436
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:31,167
<i>Both times he scores,
once across the body...</i>

437
00:52:31,328 --> 00:52:34,006
Just a second. Stay here.

438
00:52:36,245 --> 00:52:37,750
What did he say?

439
00:52:37,912 --> 00:52:42,130
<i>...release that grip around the head,
look to get up on his shoulders.</i>

440
00:52:42,287 --> 00:52:43,377
What others?

441
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,421
How many?

442
00:52:48,953 --> 00:52:51,205
We didn't agree to that.

443
00:52:52,037 --> 00:52:54,715
Fight them yourself, fatso!

444
00:53:02,578 --> 00:53:04,913
Where are the dogs going?

445
00:53:05,912 --> 00:53:07,464
Don't worry. Go inside.

446
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:10,915
Tell him I don't give a fuck!

447
00:53:11,787 --> 00:53:14,003
I said, keep him inside.

448
00:53:14,162 --> 00:53:15,204
I'm on the phone!

449
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:17,704
Take care of your kid instead!

450
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:19,459
Come here!

451
00:53:20,745 --> 00:53:21,954
What the hell?

452
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,506
Let go!

453
00:53:23,662 --> 00:53:26,163
Take care of your kid!

454
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:27,798
Calm down.

455
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:31,459
Calm the hell down!

456
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:36,166
Fucking pain in the ass! Enough!

457
00:53:44,037 --> 00:53:46,964
- He's fine.
- Get the fuck out!

458
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,040
Get out. Hands off him!

459
00:53:49,203 --> 00:53:50,246
He's fine.

460
00:53:50,412 --> 00:53:52,130
Hands off him!

461
00:53:52,287 --> 00:53:53,543
Get the fuck out!

462
00:54:03,203 --> 00:54:05,171
It's all over.

463
00:54:16,953 --> 00:54:19,252
- Martial, slower!
- Buckle her in.

464
00:54:19,412 --> 00:54:22,043
Sit up. Your seat belt.

465
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:36,622
- Who's she?
- His girlfriend.

466
00:54:36,787 --> 00:54:37,829
Okay. Open up.

467
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:53,376
He thinks he's on ESPN.

468
00:54:54,662 --> 00:54:57,044
Who are all those guys?

469
00:54:57,203 --> 00:55:00,048
Dealers, I guess. Guys with cash.

470
00:55:05,787 --> 00:55:06,829
Feel okay?

471
00:55:06,995 --> 00:55:08,833
Yeah, great.

472
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,957
Any trouble, take a fall.

473
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,506
How much in bets?

474
00:55:18,662 --> 00:55:20,914
About 2000, but it'll go up.

475
00:55:22,828 --> 00:55:23,919
What do I do?

476
00:55:24,078 --> 00:55:25,251
No women. Stay here.

477
00:55:26,037 --> 00:55:27,079
Ready.

478
00:55:28,037 --> 00:55:29,127
Come on.

479
00:56:28,912 --> 00:56:30,038
That was fast.

480
00:56:38,662 --> 00:56:39,835
Fighting again?

481
00:56:39,995 --> 00:56:41,417
What?

482
00:56:42,995 --> 00:56:45,377
Another fight after.

483
00:56:45,537 --> 00:56:47,006
I need to run.

484
00:56:54,162 --> 00:56:55,916
Fuck.

485
00:58:57,912 --> 00:59:00,211
Pull over. I want to rinse off.

486
00:59:20,578 --> 00:59:21,621
What's the noise?

487
00:59:21,787 --> 00:59:25,212
- What's that for?
- For my son.

488
00:59:26,537 --> 00:59:28,338
You have a son?

489
00:59:29,078 --> 00:59:30,667
Let's go.

490
00:59:55,662 --> 00:59:58,044
And when you're there, you hit him.

491
00:59:58,203 --> 00:59:59,246
Lay off.

492
00:59:59,412 --> 01:00:01,379
But you hit him!

493
01:00:01,537 --> 01:00:04,334
Not on purpose. He's not dead.

494
01:00:04,495 --> 01:00:06,747
Why'd you bring him along?

495
01:00:06,912 --> 01:00:09,413
You should have left him there.

496
01:00:09,578 --> 01:00:11,463
That's for you.

497
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:12,793
What is it?

498
01:00:12,953 --> 01:00:15,039
What I owe, plus a few months.

499
01:00:15,203 --> 01:00:17,704
- Where did you get it?
- I won a fight.

500
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:20,291
What fight?

501
01:00:21,245 --> 01:00:23,544
It's all you found?
Getting beat up?

502
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:25,955
You want it or not?

503
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:29,173
Don't look at me like that.

504
01:00:38,745 --> 01:00:40,085
I cheated.

505
01:00:42,953 --> 01:00:44,505
Like it?

506
01:00:47,203 --> 01:00:50,084
- Like it?
- Yes, Ali.

507
01:01:00,745 --> 01:01:03,460
- Want to swim?
- Yes, Ali.

508
01:01:08,203 --> 01:01:12,541
You're stronger than them
and they're swimming.

509
01:01:12,703 --> 01:01:14,374
- Give me a kiss.
- Don't want to.

510
01:01:14,537 --> 01:01:16,836
You do. Give Daddy a kiss.

511
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:22,419
I don't want to!

512
01:02:26,912 --> 01:02:28,796
Over there.

513
01:02:36,578 --> 01:02:38,249
Come back now.

514
01:02:44,578 --> 01:02:46,795
My job isn't to monitor customers.

515
01:02:46,953 --> 01:02:49,252
It's to monitor staff.

516
01:02:51,703 --> 01:02:54,287
Say you manage a place like this.

517
01:02:54,453 --> 01:02:57,168
Too many workers,
and union reps bust your balls.

518
01:02:57,328 --> 01:02:59,462
- What then?
- I fire them.

519
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:02,582
You need a good reason to.

520
01:03:02,745 --> 01:03:05,376
You check if they loiter
in the rest-room...

521
01:03:05,537 --> 01:03:07,622
smoke on the premises...

522
01:03:07,787 --> 01:03:09,043
take long breaks.

523
01:03:09,203 --> 01:03:13,079
Then you force them to quit,
or fire them.

524
01:03:15,287 --> 01:03:17,041
<i>My cameras are for that</i>

525
01:03:17,203 --> 01:03:21,256
<i>I don't work for the retail chains.
I work for the managers.</i>

526
01:03:21,412 --> 01:03:23,711
<i>Guys in three-piece-suits.</i>

527
01:03:23,870 --> 01:03:25,671
<i>They can't get enough of me.</i>

528
01:03:25,828 --> 01:03:29,206
<i>I've equipped every chain store
in the area.</i>

529
01:03:29,495 --> 01:03:31,296
<i>You have the right?</i>

530
01:03:31,453 --> 01:03:34,583
<i>The right?
Since when does that matter?</i>

531
01:03:34,745 --> 01:03:39,462
<i>If management is caught spying
they go straight to court.</i>

532
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:41,540
<i>Me, straight to jail.</i>

533
01:03:51,662 --> 01:03:53,878
Left, left. On your left.

534
01:03:54,037 --> 01:03:56,336
Hold on. I'll wave.

535
01:04:05,870 --> 01:04:06,913
That's great.

536
01:04:09,828 --> 01:04:12,412
- When?
- Two days ago.

537
01:04:21,162 --> 01:04:22,832
Can I see?

538
01:04:39,537 --> 01:04:41,208
Want to swim?

539
01:04:43,370 --> 01:04:45,373
I don't know.

540
01:04:45,662 --> 01:04:49,205
I'm not sure I want to get undressed.

541
01:04:58,328 --> 01:05:01,339
Seeing anyone? A girlfriend?

542
01:05:01,912 --> 01:05:03,666
You have no one?

543
01:05:03,995 --> 01:05:06,164
They're not girlfriends.

544
01:05:06,953 --> 01:05:08,589
What are they?

545
01:05:09,162 --> 01:05:11,081
Quick fucks?

546
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:17,005
A lot of them?

547
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:23,088
You mind talking about it?

548
01:05:23,245 --> 01:05:25,129
Couldn't care less.

549
01:05:28,203 --> 01:05:30,289
Were you with a lot of guys?

550
01:05:31,912 --> 01:05:33,381
Before?

551
01:05:33,912 --> 01:05:35,713
I was with Simon.

552
01:05:36,662 --> 01:05:38,214
Is that all?

553
01:05:39,537 --> 01:05:43,590
There were others, but not that many.

554
01:05:44,578 --> 01:05:46,628
I was very...

555
01:05:47,828 --> 01:05:50,045
I liked being watched.

556
01:05:51,412 --> 01:05:54,292
I liked turning them on.

557
01:05:56,078 --> 01:05:59,124
I liked getting them worked up.

558
01:06:00,578 --> 01:06:03,340
But then I got bored.

559
01:06:07,662 --> 01:06:08,704
And now?

560
01:06:10,662 --> 01:06:12,214
Nothing.

561
01:06:15,828 --> 01:06:18,080
I forgot what it's like.

562
01:06:18,828 --> 01:06:21,163
I don't know if it still works.

563
01:06:22,703 --> 01:06:24,458
No more desire?

564
01:06:25,328 --> 01:06:27,580
That's not what I said.

565
01:06:27,745 --> 01:06:28,871
Sure, I feel desire.

566
01:06:29,745 --> 01:06:31,215
Change the subject.

567
01:06:35,203 --> 01:06:36,329
I'll do that.

568
01:06:36,495 --> 01:06:40,039
Come on.
I have to use these legs now.

569
01:06:46,537 --> 01:06:48,421
You want to fuck?

570
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:52,256
What?

571
01:06:53,078 --> 01:06:57,297
To see if it still works.
If we fuck, you'll know.

572
01:07:02,287 --> 01:07:04,337
Just like that?

573
01:07:10,703 --> 01:07:14,626
I'm not sure if I can.

574
01:07:15,162 --> 01:07:17,378
Your call. You tell me.

575
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:22,792
Hold on.

576
01:08:11,828 --> 01:08:13,380
Come here!

577
01:08:54,162 --> 01:08:57,042
Do you mind if we don't kiss?

578
01:08:57,203 --> 01:08:59,123
No problem.

579
01:08:59,745 --> 01:09:01,583
Breasts okay?

580
01:09:02,908 --> 01:09:03,908
Yes.

581
01:09:13,287 --> 01:09:15,005
You're crushing me.

582
01:09:15,162 --> 01:09:16,548
No more talking now.

583
01:09:16,703 --> 01:09:18,090
Okay.

584
01:09:23,570 --> 01:09:25,122
Gentle.

585
01:09:32,078 --> 01:09:33,121
Gentle.

586
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:03,590
You okay?

587
01:10:05,412 --> 01:10:07,047
Was it good?

588
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,706
It still works?

589
01:10:12,094 --> 01:10:13,094
Yes.

590
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:14,912
No, I don't know.

591
01:10:16,495 --> 01:10:18,498
Hard to say after one time.

592
01:10:18,662 --> 01:10:21,589
Yeah, but I can't right now.
I have to go.

593
01:10:21,745 --> 01:10:24,679
That's not what I meant, actually.

594
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,974
It's new, so...

595
01:10:27,037 --> 01:10:29,881
- Was it good or not?
- Yeah, it was.

596
01:10:32,537 --> 01:10:35,547
If you're up for it, just call.
If I'm OP, no problem.

597
01:10:37,703 --> 01:10:39,125
What's OP?

598
01:10:39,287 --> 01:10:42,297
Operational.
When I'm free, when I can.

599
01:10:43,787 --> 01:10:45,196
When you're OP, we...

600
01:10:50,361 --> 01:10:51,561
All right...

601
01:10:52,787 --> 01:10:55,169
Nothing. It's great.

602
01:10:56,328 --> 01:10:57,917
I'm off, bye.

603
01:14:48,787 --> 01:14:51,465
Sure, I've missed it.

604
01:14:57,703 --> 01:14:59,209
OP?

605
01:15:35,912 --> 01:15:37,913
Shit, get dressed.

606
01:15:38,787 --> 01:15:40,624
- What is it?
- My sister.

607
01:15:42,662 --> 01:15:44,895
You scared me.
Why are you there?

608
01:15:44,953 --> 01:15:46,375
Came to meet a girl...

609
01:15:46,537 --> 01:15:48,006
You bring girls here now?

610
01:15:48,162 --> 01:15:50,544
Stephanie, come meet my sister!

611
01:15:50,703 --> 01:15:52,422
The girl from Marineland.

612
01:15:57,537 --> 01:15:59,338
Poor thing.

613
01:16:04,828 --> 01:16:06,417
Four for us.

614
01:16:06,912 --> 01:16:08,749
That's enough.

615
01:16:12,453 --> 01:16:13,923
Is that him?

616
01:16:33,162 --> 01:16:34,916
- How old is he?
- Five.

617
01:16:36,828 --> 01:16:38,878
I'm out of grapefruit.

618
01:16:39,037 --> 01:16:42,047
I brought Vita-Mix.

619
01:16:42,203 --> 01:16:44,502
Maybe you prefer tea?

620
01:16:44,662 --> 01:16:46,581
- I'll make you tea.
- It's fine!

621
01:16:46,745 --> 01:16:48,878
- I have biscuits.
- It's fine.

622
01:16:49,037 --> 01:16:51,087
No big deal.

623
01:16:51,912 --> 01:16:54,673
- Want to go?
- Why?

624
01:16:54,828 --> 01:16:56,499
Her damned tea and biscuits.

625
01:16:56,662 --> 01:16:59,624
- She's really nice.
- Sure, she is.

626
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:04,580
She's tense.
She feels like a cashier with you.

627
01:17:19,495 --> 01:17:21,214
You sleep here?

628
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:24,002
You have a nice room.

629
01:17:29,412 --> 01:17:31,829
Why are you looking at me?

630
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:33,839
Does it scare you?

631
01:17:35,953 --> 01:17:37,707
Want to see?

632
01:17:49,828 --> 01:17:51,796
Does it hurt?

633
01:17:57,203 --> 01:17:58,625
Go on.

634
01:18:40,995 --> 01:18:44,373
Use this hand to grab my leg...

635
01:18:44,537 --> 01:18:45,746
on the side.

636
01:18:49,662 --> 01:18:51,499
Same movement.

637
01:18:54,203 --> 01:18:55,590
Good job.

638
01:19:54,953 --> 01:19:56,163
You okay?

639
01:19:56,328 --> 01:19:58,912
No, I'm not. He'll kill me.

640
01:20:01,412 --> 01:20:03,000
Ready?

641
01:22:58,328 --> 01:23:00,213
Want to get down?

642
01:23:00,495 --> 01:23:02,084
Dance!

643
01:23:06,287 --> 01:23:08,124
I'm going.

644
01:24:24,828 --> 01:24:28,004
- We'll talk tomorrow, okay?
- Leaving?

645
01:24:28,162 --> 01:24:29,631
I'm off.

646
01:24:32,912 --> 01:24:34,666
Later, guys. Thanks.

647
01:25:00,703 --> 01:25:02,789
Want a drink?

648
01:25:03,912 --> 01:25:06,294
Can I buy you one?

649
01:25:07,953 --> 01:25:10,750
- Champagne.
- Two champs, Mika.

650
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:14,038
I'm Pierre. And you?

651
01:25:14,203 --> 01:25:16,041
Marie.

652
01:25:16,662 --> 01:25:19,127
Come here often?

653
01:25:19,287 --> 01:25:20,958
On and off.

654
01:25:44,162 --> 01:25:47,006
I'm sorry. Not tonight.
I don't feel like it.

655
01:25:47,162 --> 01:25:48,750
No problem.

656
01:25:50,162 --> 01:25:51,750
I'm leaving.

657
01:25:51,912 --> 01:25:53,251
Thanks for the drink.

658
01:25:55,703 --> 01:25:56,746
I'm sorry, I...

659
01:25:57,870 --> 01:26:00,336
- Sorry for what?
- I couldn't know.

660
01:26:00,495 --> 01:26:01,538
Know what?

661
01:26:01,703 --> 01:26:03,504
I couldn't know...

662
01:26:03,662 --> 01:26:05,712
you had a...

663
01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:07,422
- Didn't have...
- Have what?

664
01:27:14,037 --> 01:27:15,791
You okay?

665
01:27:24,037 --> 01:27:26,122
You all stay late?

666
01:27:26,287 --> 01:27:27,839
I don't know.

667
01:27:28,870 --> 01:27:30,126
And your night?

668
01:27:30,287 --> 01:27:31,875
Normal.

669
01:27:39,078 --> 01:27:41,875
You think it's okay, talking like that?

670
01:27:42,037 --> 01:27:46,125
I ask how it went with the girl.
And you answer me 'normal'!?

671
01:27:47,703 --> 01:27:49,671
What should I say?

672
01:27:53,370 --> 01:27:54,792
Nothing.

673
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:56,163
What?

674
01:27:56,703 --> 01:27:59,169
Normal, like picking up
some bimbo there with me?

675
01:27:59,328 --> 01:28:02,339
- What would you say if I did it?
- Nothing.

676
01:28:02,495 --> 01:28:03,881
Really?

677
01:28:05,703 --> 01:28:08,963
You're being a pain.
What's the problem?

678
01:28:10,870 --> 01:28:12,873
What am I to you?

679
01:28:13,245 --> 01:28:14,631
A friend?

680
01:28:14,787 --> 01:28:16,292
A pal?

681
01:28:16,453 --> 01:28:19,168
A buddy like Foued and the others?

682
01:28:19,328 --> 01:28:21,497
You fuck your buddies?

683
01:28:30,495 --> 01:28:33,422
If we continue, we have to do it right.

684
01:28:34,162 --> 01:28:35,963
Let's show some manners.

685
01:28:37,078 --> 01:28:39,579
I mean consideration.

686
01:28:41,287 --> 01:28:44,416
You've always been
so considerate with me.

687
01:28:50,787 --> 01:28:52,671
Is that a plan?

688
01:28:55,787 --> 01:28:58,370
We continue, but not like animals.

689
01:29:06,953 --> 01:29:08,505
What is it?

690
01:29:11,912 --> 01:29:13,500
I'm OP.

691
01:29:16,870 --> 01:29:19,087
I'm OP, that's all.

692
01:29:19,745 --> 01:29:22,079
Why are you staring?

693
01:29:22,828 --> 01:29:23,871
Not up for it?

694
01:29:29,245 --> 01:29:31,046
Why not?

695
01:30:28,745 --> 01:30:31,542
We're calling the cops anyway!

696
01:30:31,828 --> 01:30:33,796
Get the equipment.

697
01:30:33,953 --> 01:30:36,087
Spying on your employees!

698
01:30:39,745 --> 01:30:42,127
Be man enough to look me in the eyes.

699
01:30:42,287 --> 01:30:44,965
Don't touch me.

700
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:47,372
He's guilty and he calls the cops.

701
01:30:54,828 --> 01:30:56,464
What are you doing?

702
01:30:56,620 --> 01:30:58,291
Packing up.

703
01:30:58,953 --> 01:31:00,707
Your equipment?

704
01:31:01,662 --> 01:31:03,001
No pictures.

705
01:31:03,162 --> 01:31:04,667
You work for them?

706
01:31:04,828 --> 01:31:06,250
I said, no pictures.

707
01:31:06,412 --> 01:31:08,082
No pictures? You film us!

708
01:31:08,245 --> 01:31:10,544
I'll smash your head in!

709
01:31:17,203 --> 01:31:20,166
Don't worry.
We got your faces!

710
01:31:20,328 --> 01:31:21,750
Shut up!

711
01:31:24,037 --> 01:31:27,047
I need to leave for a few months.

712
01:31:28,328 --> 01:31:32,121
Ali wants more fights.
You can take over while I'm away.

713
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:36,506
He's okay with it?

714
01:31:36,662 --> 01:31:38,712
He told me to call you.

715
01:31:42,412 --> 01:31:43,668
Why me?

716
01:31:43,828 --> 01:31:45,666
I guess he trusts you.

717
01:31:46,370 --> 01:31:49,167
I don't know the scene, those guys.

718
01:31:50,662 --> 01:31:52,665
Seen me with those beasts?

719
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:54,329
Yeah.

720
01:31:58,328 --> 01:32:01,919
It's all in here.
For the rest, ask and I'll answer.

721
01:32:04,412 --> 01:32:05,917
What about the betting?

722
01:32:06,078 --> 01:32:08,295
Can you count on your fingers?

723
01:32:09,203 --> 01:32:10,625
This one?

724
01:32:10,787 --> 01:32:12,588
Over there?

725
01:32:13,578 --> 01:32:15,877
I see you have a slight problem there.

726
01:32:16,037 --> 01:32:18,454
Yeah. An automatic, sorry.

727
01:32:18,620 --> 01:32:20,670
That's just what you need.

728
01:32:20,828 --> 01:32:22,748
But it has to look hot.

729
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:57,045
RIGHT

730
01:33:45,412 --> 01:33:46,834
You okay, RoboCop?

731
01:33:46,995 --> 01:33:48,500
What a madhouse.

732
01:33:48,662 --> 01:33:50,914
- How much?
- 3 400.

733
01:33:51,370 --> 01:33:52,543
Ready?

734
01:34:20,828 --> 01:34:22,380
I'm here.

735
01:34:25,328 --> 01:34:26,964
Don't look at me like this.

736
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:28,211
What are you doing?

737
01:34:28,370 --> 01:34:30,041
Taking a leek.

738
01:34:32,245 --> 01:34:33,999
Can I have my T-shirt?

739
01:34:34,162 --> 01:34:37,042
- What time is it?
- Six.

740
01:34:39,912 --> 01:34:42,211
I went out like a light.

741
01:34:43,662 --> 01:34:46,293
I don't want you seeing me like this.

742
01:34:46,453 --> 01:34:47,745
Hang on.

743
01:34:47,912 --> 01:34:49,168
Come here.

744
01:35:17,412 --> 01:35:19,877
What? What is it?

745
01:35:33,787 --> 01:35:35,837
We're allowed to now?

746
01:36:07,787 --> 01:36:09,790
Follow me, please.

747
01:36:09,953 --> 01:36:11,079
Management wants you.

748
01:36:13,495 --> 01:36:15,130
Wait here.

749
01:36:16,995 --> 01:36:18,465
You're here too?

750
01:36:18,620 --> 01:36:20,705
Yeah. And you?

751
01:36:23,537 --> 01:36:25,504
Know why we're here?

752
01:36:44,953 --> 01:36:46,459
So?

753
01:36:46,953 --> 01:36:48,340
I got fired.

754
01:36:48,495 --> 01:36:49,668
Don't worry, honey.

755
01:36:49,828 --> 01:36:51,914
Check this out.

756
01:36:55,912 --> 01:36:57,583
That's him packing up.

757
01:36:57,745 --> 01:37:00,791
This is when he tried to hit me.

758
01:37:01,953 --> 01:37:04,205
He left afterwards.

759
01:37:04,370 --> 01:37:06,587
I caught him red-handed.

760
01:37:44,287 --> 01:37:45,875
You okay?

761
01:37:47,787 --> 01:37:50,335
- What are you doing?
- I'm hungry.

762
01:37:50,495 --> 01:37:52,415
Shut that.

763
01:37:52,787 --> 01:37:54,837
You can't eat here.

764
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:58,670
You can't eat.

765
01:37:58,953 --> 01:38:01,039
What's this about?

766
01:38:01,870 --> 01:38:04,501
I got fired. I'm unemployed.

767
01:38:14,495 --> 01:38:17,671
What's the connection
with me not eating?

768
01:38:20,245 --> 01:38:21,667
The connection?

769
01:38:21,828 --> 01:38:24,590
There were cameras in the storing place.

770
01:38:25,328 --> 01:38:28,789
They saw us taking expired food
and fired us.

771
01:38:28,953 --> 01:38:31,170
You got your sister fired.

772
01:38:35,578 --> 01:38:37,416
How does that feel?

773
01:38:40,328 --> 01:38:42,663
How much did you get?

774
01:38:43,162 --> 01:38:46,587
Are you paid per store or a flat rate?

775
01:38:50,203 --> 01:38:51,839
No comment?

776
01:38:53,995 --> 01:38:55,915
I take you in, see to your kid.

777
01:38:56,078 --> 01:38:59,124
You get me fired, but no comment.

778
01:38:59,662 --> 01:39:00,953
Great.

779
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:04,246
I couldn't know.

780
01:39:04,412 --> 01:39:07,457
You couldn't know?
I don't understand.

781
01:39:08,578 --> 01:39:11,210
How could you do something like that?

782
01:39:12,370 --> 01:39:15,416
Whose side you're on? Theirs?

783
01:39:15,578 --> 01:39:17,664
What's going on in your head?

784
01:39:17,828 --> 01:39:19,629
You couldn't know what?

785
01:39:19,787 --> 01:39:22,204
That you were fucking us over?

786
01:39:22,370 --> 01:39:25,629
That we'd end up flat broke?

787
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:47,709
Calm down.

788
01:39:48,287 --> 01:39:50,372
Calm down, I said.

789
01:39:51,078 --> 01:39:53,461
Get your stuff and beat it.

790
01:39:54,328 --> 01:39:56,580
Don't show your face here again.

791
01:39:57,037 --> 01:39:58,708
Move it.

792
01:40:42,495 --> 01:40:45,505
OP?

793
01:41:19,995 --> 01:41:21,796
Ali the shit he left.

794
01:41:23,245 --> 01:41:26,125
His message said Strasbourg.

795
01:41:26,287 --> 01:41:28,290
God knows if he's still there.

796
01:41:28,453 --> 01:41:30,705
He never called you?

797
01:41:30,870 --> 01:41:32,920
Did you try the gym?

798
01:41:33,078 --> 01:41:35,081
They have no idea.

799
01:41:35,245 --> 01:41:37,828
If I had a number, I'd give it to you.

800
01:41:37,995 --> 01:41:40,329
Even after all the crap he did.

801
01:41:40,495 --> 01:41:42,214
You believe me?

802
01:41:43,745 --> 01:41:45,499
I believe you.

803
01:41:45,662 --> 01:41:47,084
Imagine!

804
01:41:47,245 --> 01:41:50,208
He left his kid.
It all means jack shit to him.

805
01:41:50,370 --> 01:41:51,461
You don't know him.

806
01:41:51,620 --> 01:41:54,335
I don't?
What did you expect from him?

807
01:41:54,495 --> 01:41:56,084
I don't know.

808
01:41:56,245 --> 01:41:57,636
Not this.

809
01:42:59,078 --> 01:43:01,793
Keep moving. Raise your arms.

810
01:43:05,370 --> 01:43:07,788
Keep your arms up. Aim.

811
01:43:54,120 --> 01:43:56,419
Any further and I can't back up.

812
01:43:56,578 --> 01:43:58,214
You got a new truck?

813
01:43:58,370 --> 01:44:00,208
I changed bosses.

814
01:44:00,370 --> 01:44:02,207
Back to being exploited.

815
01:44:02,412 --> 01:44:04,083
Ali.

816
01:44:04,453 --> 01:44:06,291
Put on your coat.

817
01:44:06,453 --> 01:44:07,840
Are things okay?

818
01:44:07,995 --> 01:44:09,584
It's fine.

819
01:44:10,245 --> 01:44:11,288
And Anna?

820
01:44:11,828 --> 01:44:13,001
She's fine.

821
01:44:13,162 --> 01:44:16,338
Working part-time in a school cafeteria.

822
01:44:16,495 --> 01:44:17,787
She likes it.

823
01:44:21,912 --> 01:44:24,673
- She knows about today?
- Sure.

824
01:44:25,995 --> 01:44:29,835
Tell her I can't help now,
but once I have money...

825
01:44:31,328 --> 01:44:33,414
Don't worry.
When's your fight?

826
01:44:33,578 --> 01:44:36,505
- Next month, the 9th.
- Keep me posted.

827
01:44:38,662 --> 01:44:40,214
Come on, Sam.

828
01:44:40,370 --> 01:44:43,085
I'm handing over, Mr. Sam.

829
01:44:43,245 --> 01:44:45,663
- My mittens.
- Give me a kiss.

830
01:44:47,287 --> 01:44:49,372
Extraction.

831
01:44:53,078 --> 01:44:54,251
I'll go deliver.

832
01:44:54,412 --> 01:44:57,256
I'll pick him up at 7 tonight.

833
01:44:59,412 --> 01:45:00,703
Seven p.m., okay?

834
01:45:00,870 --> 01:45:03,204
I have to be back tomorrow by 11.

835
01:45:03,370 --> 01:45:04,461
Don't worry.

836
01:45:07,745 --> 01:45:09,665
Sam! Make a snowman!

837
01:45:09,828 --> 01:45:11,038
Goodbye!

838
01:45:12,162 --> 01:45:13,916
I'll get you some fries!

839
01:45:14,078 --> 01:45:15,630
Okay.

840
01:45:23,203 --> 01:45:25,704
I want to skate too.

841
01:45:25,870 --> 01:45:27,340
They're skiing.

842
01:45:27,495 --> 01:45:28,621
They were skating.

843
01:45:28,787 --> 01:45:31,631
- Skiing, I said.
- Skating.

844
01:45:32,495 --> 01:45:33,881
Skiing.

845
01:45:34,037 --> 01:45:36,004
You're bugging me.

846
01:45:43,203 --> 01:45:45,088
Faster?

847
01:45:46,037 --> 01:45:48,170
I'll let go and you steer.

848
01:45:48,328 --> 01:45:51,090
Start steering now!

849
01:46:33,412 --> 01:46:34,538
Careful.

850
01:46:34,703 --> 01:46:35,829
Get the sled.

851
01:46:36,453 --> 01:46:38,005
Get on.

852
01:46:41,412 --> 01:46:43,711
One, two, three, go!

853
01:46:58,703 --> 01:47:00,706
One more.

854
01:47:08,370 --> 01:47:10,752
Ten more minutes, okay?

855
01:47:31,662 --> 01:47:33,380
Sam!

856
01:47:36,203 --> 01:47:37,874
Sam!

857
01:47:39,870 --> 01:47:41,292
Sam!

858
01:47:42,412 --> 01:47:43,798
Sam!

859
01:48:05,870 --> 01:48:07,292
Sam.

860
01:48:08,412 --> 01:48:09,538
Help!

861
01:48:55,037 --> 01:48:56,625
Sam!

862
01:49:06,037 --> 01:49:07,210
Sam.

863
01:49:07,370 --> 01:49:09,005
Sam.

864
01:49:09,162 --> 01:49:10,797
Sam!

865
01:50:11,662 --> 01:50:13,830
Let's go take care of you.

866
01:51:13,578 --> 01:51:15,084
Can you hold it?

867
01:51:15,245 --> 01:51:17,165
Yeah, go on.

868
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:45,004
Yeah, he's better.

869
01:51:47,078 --> 01:51:48,548
I'll put him on.

870
01:51:48,953 --> 01:51:50,921
She wants to talk to you.

871
01:51:51,078 --> 01:51:52,797
Is it Anna?

872
01:51:57,078 --> 01:51:58,667
<i>It's me.</i>

873
01:52:00,703 --> 01:52:02,422
<i>Do you mind?</i>

874
01:52:07,828 --> 01:52:09,547
<i>How is he?</i>

875
01:52:10,537 --> 01:52:13,038
He woke up an hour ago.

876
01:52:16,745 --> 01:52:18,334
<i>Is he hurt?</i>

877
01:52:18,495 --> 01:52:20,333
I don't think so.

878
01:52:22,328 --> 01:52:23,999
<i>How are you?</i>

879
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:27,668
I busted my hands on the ice.

880
01:52:30,120 --> 01:52:31,625
<i>Bad?</i>

881
01:52:32,495 --> 01:52:34,333
They're fractured.

882
01:52:41,828 --> 01:52:43,547
And you?

883
01:52:44,995 --> 01:52:46,796
<i>I'm okay.</i>

884
01:52:46,953 --> 01:52:48,459
What are you up to?

885
01:52:48,620 --> 01:52:51,666
<i>You mean now?</i>

886
01:52:52,037 --> 01:52:53,791
<i>Or just in general?</i>

887
01:52:53,953 --> 01:52:56,631
- I wanted to say...
<i>-You don't need to.</i>

888
01:52:56,787 --> 01:52:58,624
<i>I'll let you go.</i>

889
01:52:59,245 --> 01:53:02,339
<i>I'll call you back to see how Sam is.</i>

890
01:53:02,495 --> 01:53:04,996
<i>- Give him a kiss.</i>
- Don't hang up.

891
01:53:07,620 --> 01:53:09,209
Don't hang up.

892
01:53:09,370 --> 01:53:11,041
<i>I won't hang up.</i>

893
01:53:19,620 --> 01:53:21,789
For three hours...

894
01:53:21,953 --> 01:53:24,087
he was in a coma.

895
01:53:25,120 --> 01:53:27,454
For three hours, he was dead.

896
01:53:30,620 --> 01:53:32,837
I was afraid to lose him.

897
01:53:39,787 --> 01:53:41,209
Don't leave me.

898
01:53:41,370 --> 01:53:43,208
<i>I won't</i>

899
01:53:51,578 --> 01:53:53,214
<i>I love you.</i>

900
01:54:19,287 --> 01:54:22,084
<i>Twenty-seven bones
in a human hand.</i>

901
01:54:23,537 --> 01:54:25,836
<i>Certain monkeys have more.</i>

902
01:54:25,995 --> 01:54:28,875
<i>Gorillas, 32.
Five in each thumb.</i>

903
01:54:29,037 --> 01:54:31,253
<i>A man has 27.</i>

904
01:54:31,412 --> 01:54:34,505
<i>You break a hand,
you break a leg...</i>

905
01:54:34,662 --> 01:54:38,454
<i>after a while,
calcium joins it back together.</i>

906
01:54:38,620 --> 01:54:41,417
<i>It ends up even
stronger than before.</i>

907
01:54:42,578 --> 01:54:46,797
<i>But break a bone in your hand
and you'll see it never heals.</i>

908
01:54:49,662 --> 01:54:53,880
<i>You'll remember it at each fight,
with every punch.</i>

909
01:54:54,787 --> 01:54:56,671
<i>You'll be careful.</i>

910
01:54:57,078 --> 01:54:58,630
<i>But one day...</i>

911
01:54:58,787 --> 01:55:01,584
<i>the pain will comeback.</i>

912
01:55:01,995 --> 01:55:03,879
<i>Like needles.</i>

913
01:55:04,662 --> 01:55:06,629
<i>Like broken glass.</i>

914
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:23,038
