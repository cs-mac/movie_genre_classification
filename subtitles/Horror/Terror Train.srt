1
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:51,146
<i>Happy New Year.!</i>

2
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:54,709
Sigma, Phi, Omega, hey! Sigma, Phi, Omega, hey!

3
00:00:54,821 --> 00:01:00,123
Sigma, Phi, Omega, hey! Sigma, Phi, Omega, hey!
Sigma, Phi, Omega, hey!

4
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:19,176
Hey, there she is now.

5
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:23,079
<i>Will you tell me
what she sees in you, please?</i>

6
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:26,280
Can you figure
this one out, Ed?

7
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,354
I mean, now,
this guy's got some luck.

8
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:31,049
Women are strange, Doctor.

9
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:34,456
- Very strange.
- Right, Ed. Sensitive.

10
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,860
<i>He's probably very sensitive.
Chicks go for the sensitive fellows, you know.</i>

11
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:39,864
Yeah, well, I wouldn't mind
going in your place.

12
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:42,662
<i>Yeah, you would, wouldn't you, you devil?</i>

13
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:46,603
- You want him to fill in for ya? Huh?
- Offensive.

14
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:50,039
<i>- This is true love, old man.
- Touché, Jackson.</i>

15
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:54,876
Look, Alana's nice.
Confused, but nice.

16
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:57,711
Hey, there she goes.

17
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:06,222
Now, what do you say, huh? Huh?

18
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:09,295
- You trust me? Okay.
- We're gonna take good care of you.

19
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:11,295
- Come on.
- Let's go.

20
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,592
Don't worry.

21
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,863
What are you laughing at?
Come on!

22
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,565
- You're gonna love it.
- Give me that. You're gonna
need both your hands free.

23
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:24,575
You're gonna be wearing that beanie
all year if you don't get laid tonight.

24
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:27,373
Laid, sir? Me, sir?

25
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:36,916
Okay. Bare tit.
See what you can do.

26
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:42,226
Sorry. After you get laid.

27
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,532
Still wearing your beanie
I see, huh?

28
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:53,095
- Well, happy New Year anyway, buddy.
- Hey, same to you, Doc.

29
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:59,635
- Is that real?
- Is the pope Catholic?

30
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,873
I don't know what you're gonna do
when we get to med school.

31
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,249
<i>I'm losing my nerve.
I don't even know this guy.</i>

32
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,822
- Mitchy!
- You look adorable!

33
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,051
- I feel like an idiot.
- You can't chicken out now.

34
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:16,925
- Why am I doing this?
- Because you're the best bait
we got around here, honey.

35
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,624
- Come on. It'll be fun.
- Fun?

36
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:29,098
Oh, my God.
Look at this place!

37
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,177
I know.

38
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,709
- Who is that?
- I don't know.

39
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:37,681
Some friend of Doc's.
Anyway, you know what to do.

40
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,945
- Okay?
- Yeah, but I don't like it.

41
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,784
<i>- Go get her, tiger.
- Come on, Kenny. Go for it.!</i>

42
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,790
<i>- Go on.!
- Mitchy.!</i>

43
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,723
<i>Don't be afraid, Kenny.</i>

44
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,727
<i>- Hey, what are you doing?
- Mitchy!</i>

45
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:53,424
- Now, look, you really want her, right?
- Mm-hmm.

46
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:56,434
Okay. Go ahead.

47
00:03:56,536 --> 00:04:00,097
We'll be down here
if you need us. All right?

48
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,846
- Alana?
- Hello, Kenny.

49
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:14,145
Don't be shy.
This is my first time too.

50
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,762
Kiss me, Kenny.

51
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:34,389
<i>Kiss me.</i>

52
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,901
Kiss me.

53
00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:00,539
Yes, it's the opportunity
of a lifetime, my boy!

54
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,581
- One more. Hold it.
- Now!

55
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:13,852
- Ready?
- Yes!

56
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,361
There you go.

57
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:20,557
A train!

58
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,658
Well, you wouldn't let me buy you
a graduation present, so I got you this instead.

59
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:25,669
I love you.

60
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:39,875
Has anyone seen my girlfriend?
She's the one with the big caboose!

61
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,181
- You gonna let him get away with this?
- No way!

62
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:51,060
Hey! Now, this is
what I call a party!

63
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:56,124
- L-I'd like to propose a toast.
- Ridiculous!

64
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:59,864
- That's not toast, my good man.
- Shut up!

65
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,133
It's a real honor
hosting with you guys.

66
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,970
- I mean that.
- Hey, same here.

67
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:08,274
My last big college party.
But it's gonna be the best!

68
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,580
Hey! To four really great years.

69
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,586
- Oh, yeah!
- Really.

70
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,563
<i>Let's get the goodies. Come on.
I'll see you later on the train.</i>

71
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,093
- Oh, thanks.
- Are you guys medical students?

72
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:32,796
Well, premed.
Here's your date, Ed.

73
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:37,774
- Listen, thank you very much.
Would you like a joint?
- Yeah, I wouldn't mind one.

74
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:41,278
- Go ahead, help yourself.
- Oh, my God.

75
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,213
- Thank you very much, boys.
You're really a lot of fun.
- Hey, Doc, give me.

76
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,808
- Lot of fun.
- Come on. Let's get this thing into gear.

77
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,547
All right!

78
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:59,790
Hey, Donnelly.
Take a look at this.

79
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:03,699
My goodness gracious!

80
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:07,967
Happy New Year!

81
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,474
Goodies for everybody!

82
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,842
- Mr. Conductor!
- Yeah?

83
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,543
Did you say "all aboard"?
That's ridiculous!

84
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:23,179
They can't be bored.
I haven't even started.

85
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,851
Hey, Fred, forget it.

86
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,487
She's not your type.
Think of the children!

87
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:35,196
Come on, baby.
Open your eyes.

88
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:40,238
<i>Come on. Look at me.
Just my luck. She's a lesbian.</i>

89
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:44,503
Wait a sec. I've got an idea.
Let's play charades, and my word will be "orgy."

90
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:49,711
Wait, wait, wait!
I think she sprung a leak.

91
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,477
Either that,
or she's hissing me.

92
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:57,918
Excuse me. Excuse me.

93
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:06,895
Here, let me give you
a hand with that.

94
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,234
Thanks a lot.

95
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:14,238
- You the slicker of this outfit?
- I try to be.

96
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,736
- Extraordinaire!
- Hey, fella!

97
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:24,510
Did you make my date disappear?

98
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,148
- Come on. Let's check this train out.
- No, I've gotta find Pet...

99
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:32,383
before I forget
what she looks like.

100
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,627
<i>You may have some weather,
but the fella who came through at 6... 00...</i>

101
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,893
said the track was clear.

102
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,900
Try and see
they don't tear it apart.

103
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:47,166
<i>With a party like that, I'm always afraid
some kid's gonna hurt himself.</i>

104
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:51,004
Maggie, I wish to hell
they'd put a radio on that train.

105
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,568
What if one of those kids
got drunk and fell off?

106
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,547
I've been talkin' on that
for two years.

107
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:03,112
Belknap always puts
the kibosh on it.

108
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,383
<i>He says, "We ain't Amtrak.</i>

109
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,891
<i>We'rejust a little old
excursion train. "</i>

110
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:10,223
He oughta be here tonight.

111
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:12,559
<i>Be like ridin'herd
on a flea circus.</i>

112
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:27,211
Are you sure
you won't go with us, Maggie?

113
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,747
With a bunch like that?
Not on your life.

114
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:34,185
All right.
I'll see you tomorrow.

115
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:36,948
<i>- So long.
- So long.</i>

116
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:42,455
You folks ready
for the time of your life?

117
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:45,928
You won't be disappointed,
I promise.

118
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:54,199
All aboard!

119
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,776
Hey, look at Ed!

120
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:07,444
Fantastic!

121
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:10,886
Fabulous blood! Hey, did you see Ed?
Pretty good, eh?

122
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,390
Way to go, Eduardo!

123
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,351
<i>I don't know. I think the bar car's up this way.</i>

124
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,353
Anybody home?

125
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,013
- Hi.
- Is this the sink?

126
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:52,715
- Yeah.
- Looks like a bedpan.

127
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:55,817
- I think it is.
- Congratulations, by the way.

128
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:58,590
- Thank you.
- And lots of luck, for sure.

129
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:01,029
- Hiya, Mitchy.
- Hi. How's it goin'?

130
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:03,624
My roommate's graduating early too.

131
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,432
Maybe then Mitchy and I
can room together.

132
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,608
You're gonna stick me with that?

133
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,803
- What's wrong? Bunnies are cute.
- Oh, thanks.

134
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:21,185
Hey, come on. You know I have to work
before school starts. It's gonna be real expensive.

135
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:24,188
Shit. You'll get a scholarship.
You always do.

136
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,918
<i>- Well, I don't have one yet.
- Marry Mo and you won't need one.</i>

137
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,926
<i>Have you been talkin'
to him again?</i>

138
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,464
- Come on. I am gonna miss you.
- Yeah?

139
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:37,501
- Yeah.
- Aw, shoot. You're my only girlfriend.

140
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,629
<i>- You know that?
- You're my best friend. You know that?</i>

141
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:43,708
I am gonna miss you like crazy.

142
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,277
Oh! Oh, no.

143
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:48,778
I'm just an easy cry, that's all.

144
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,076
I can't let Doc see me like this.

145
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,083
- Where's the girls' room on this boat anyway?
- Hey, you.

146
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,676
- Hmm?
- We're always gonna be friends.

147
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:59,155
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

148
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,226
Yeah.

149
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:20,368
- Hi, Prez.
- Hey, Pet, how you doin'?

150
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,572
- Have you guys seen Eddie around?
- Ed?

151
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:25,980
- Check the car back there. It's open.
- Okay.

152
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:31,117
- She still runnin' hot on you?
- Nope.

153
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:33,453
Cooled down the grade.

154
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,993
She's really beautiful,
that old engine.

155
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,325
They don't make 'em
like that anymore.

156
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,331
Thank God for little favors.

157
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:44,231
<i>You're gonna see a train on the cover
of Time magazine one of these days...</i>

158
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,429
<i>and I'm gonna be
in that cab in the picture.</i>

159
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:49,666
And I'll be up in the Concorde,
and you'll be on welfare.

160
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:53,176
<i>You're diggin'your own grave
with that shovel career-wise.</i>

161
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,746
What's the price of gas right now?

162
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,612
Pretty soon, the only way
you'll get that beer can someplace...

163
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,241
<i>is you load it on a flatcar.</i>

164
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,286
Guess who'll be driving the train?

165
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:08,092
You can cook, you can take a shower,
you can watch TV...

166
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,855
and, by God,
you can hang a left if you feel like it.

167
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:15,098
That poor, deluded boy.

168
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:33,075
<i>It's a rotten crowd.
Listen to 'em.</i>

169
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:36,086
Well, it beats
a six-year-old's birthday party.

170
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:39,248
I have to have it quiet
when I do my illusions.

171
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:41,258
You know, it pays better too.

172
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,160
<i>Hey, I thought you said
you'd played frat parties before.</i>

173
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,664
<i>- They're not gonna watch.
- Oh, they'll watch.</i>

174
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:49,700
<i>Go out and do
some close-up magic.</i>

175
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:53,101
<i>- Warm 'em up.
- I'm not ready.</i>

176
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:58,608
Okay, here we go!
Stimulation for the nation.

177
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,474
<i>Hey, host lounge for seniors only.!</i>

178
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,947
<i>- Get out.!
- What do you think this is? Come on. Seniors only.</i>

179
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,746
We are gonna be remembered
forever for this one.

180
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,083
- Happy Hog Night, children.
- Hog Night?

181
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:13,625
Hog Night! That's right.
That's what they used to call it.

182
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:17,126
Big bonfire, and all
the pledges had to get laid.

183
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:20,426
It's true. They had to abolish it.
Something happened one year...

184
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:23,501
<i>- and they had to kick a whole
bunch of guys out of school.
- Well, almost kicked out.</i>

185
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,527
Christ, did we do that?

186
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,868
- You're the guys?
- Oh, no, it wasn't us.

187
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:30,874
It must've been somebody else.

188
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:34,878
Look, it was supposed to be a simple joke,
and it sort of got out of control one year.

189
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,346
<i>- Just forget about it.
- You wanna know what really happened?</i>

190
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,349
- Yeah!
- Will you just drop it?

191
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,817
We were freshmen.
It's Christmas vacation.

192
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,855
I got a job at the medical center,
practically a janitor.

193
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:48,688
So I go into this lab one night.
It's unlocked...

194
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,854
and there's this lady there...
poor soul... who'd just fallen apart.

195
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,864
<i>Yeah, literally.</i>

196
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:57,595
Now, I promised these dorks I was gonna
come up with something truly special.

197
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:03,073
<i>Yeah, really special.
Put a kid in the hospital.</i>

198
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,200
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I ruin your punch line?</i>

199
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,303
You tell them.
You were there, remember?

200
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,750
Hey, Alana.

201
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,486
Sucks to you.

202
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:24,960
Hey, come on. It's New Year's!
Let's be happy!

203
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:28,055
- Why don't you let these poor children go?
- Okay, children, run along.

204
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,260
Another time. Leave the women here.
Thank you very much.

205
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:33,497
<i>- Thanks for the booze, sir.
- Yeah, thanks.
- Booze?</i>

206
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,768
Well, that was
actually nice of you.

207
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,004
- Now, what are we gonna drink?
- What are we gonna drink?

208
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,013
-What are we gonna drink
-What are we gonna drink

209
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,015
-What are we gonna drink
- Champagne!

210
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,594
Absolutely there's a future in it.

211
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,596
People gotta come back to rail.

212
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,428
I'll bet you read
a lot of science fiction.

213
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,968
Hey, Shovels,
you know what we call him?

214
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,594
<i>Winnebago.</i>

215
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,469
How is the R.V. Business these days?

216
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,475
How the hell do you think it is?

217
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:15,206
I wouldn't be here if
I wasn't up to my hind end in inventory.

218
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:17,373
<i>But I'll move 'em sooner or later.</i>

219
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:20,645
Should've got out
10 years ago, not five.

220
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:26,122
<i>Now, think on this. When's the last time
somebody built a shopping mall...</i>

221
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,125
<i>next to a train station?</i>

222
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,991
Think about that.

223
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,943
Jesus!

224
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:48,638
Oh! It's you!

225
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,840
You about scared
the pants right off me.

226
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:53,213
You are bad, Eduardo.

227
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:56,082
What's this?
Oh, that thing.

228
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:59,919
Not only is that gross,
but I know who gave it to you.

229
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:03,290
Mm-hmm. Somebody else
is looking for you-hoo.

230
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:09,033
Mm-hmm.

231
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:11,796
You wanna know who she is?

232
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:15,771
Uh-huh. Well...

233
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:18,342
a cute little thing.

234
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:21,071
Now, tell me, what's her name?
Pet... that's it.

235
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,272
Are you stoned?

236
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:25,282
Surprise!

237
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,284
<i>Get lost.!</i>

238
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:30,014
Ow! That hurts!

239
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:33,091
How you doin', Eduardo?

240
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:35,284
Jesus!

241
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:39,091
Hey, Ed, that number
at the station...

242
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:44,168
with the sword,
better than Doc could have done.

243
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:47,796
Super fantastic, man.

244
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,974
Hey, Ed, want a drink?

245
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:08,149
Shh!

246
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,751
I've got the good stuff, Ed.

247
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:17,095
Hey, where do they keep
the glasses?

248
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:22,672
<i>Ah, here they are.
Now we're talkin' Whoops.!</i>

249
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:26,574
<i>Easy, Jackson. Here we go, Eduardo.
How's this?</i>

250
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:30,739
Hey, hey, hey! Take it easy, man.
What are you doin'?

251
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:35,047
Oh, my God! No! No, no!

252
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:46,459
<i>- Very classy.
- You like this, huh?</i>

253
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:51,867
You know, I've always wanted
my own toy train, but this is ridiculous.

254
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,734
- You know, you're very imaginative, buster.
- I have my moments.

255
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,640
I know. Hey, Mitch,
I may have to marry him after all.

256
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:01,611
Marry me.

257
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,715
<i>- It was my idea.
- Aw, Doc.</i>

258
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:09,878
I cannot tell a lie.
I'm sorry, buddy.

259
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:12,479
<i>- It got stuck in my throat.
- I thought you said it was your idea.</i>

260
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:14,752
<i>Look, I know I suggested
letting her think otherwise.</i>

261
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,727
- That's real generous of you.
- Thank you.

262
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:20,593
<i>- So you're the one who's paying for all this.
- Oh, no.</i>

263
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:24,897
Mo's the one with the bread.
I've got all the ideas.

264
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:28,939
For instance, guess what I put
in the stuff I gave those dorks?

265
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,235
You asshole!

266
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,937
You can't have a good time
without hurting somebody, can you?

267
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:36,479
Is that why you told me
it was your idea?

268
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:40,142
<i>'Cause I said I'd never go
to another one ofhis fucking parties?</i>

269
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,618
Alana, you're always walking out
on my parties.

270
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:46,452
<i>But this time, you can't.</i>

271
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:53,463
I'll get you for this one, Doc.

272
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,927
I mean it this time.

273
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:11,515
Now, look, this was
a good idea, right?

274
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,846
- Right?
- Yeah.

275
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,853
- So what the hell does it matter...
- It matters a lot!

276
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,490
I'm sorry.

277
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,861
I know.

278
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:30,897
I just can't wait for the other surprises
he's got planned.

279
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:33,027
Whoopee cushions, exploding cigars.

280
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:36,198
Oh, Jesus.

281
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:41,336
<i>- What?
- Somebody broke a bottle in there... already.</i>

282
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:43,778
I told you it was gonna be
another one of these stupid parties.

283
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:46,851
Come on!
Give it a chance, will ya?

284
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:14,975
Hey, Carne, what about those
smart alecks in the back?

285
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,275
Shouldn't we take a look-see?

286
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:21,341
Nah. I'd be a wet blanket
if I walked through there now.

287
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,353
They can cool down
by themselves.

288
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:26,288
Good evening.

289
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:34,058
Admit it. You're impressed.

290
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:36,065
Okay, I'm impressed.

291
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:38,533
- Mo...
- Good evening, ladies. Welcome aboard.

292
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:40,798
- Hello.
- How are you? So where are the guys?

293
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:42,806
- Weren't they with you?
- No, I didn't see 'em.

294
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:44,808
<i>Jackson was there for a while, but he must've...</i>

295
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,539
- Look, he's doing magic.
- A magician. What a great idea. Come on.

296
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:50,547
<i>- I wanna get some peanuts.
- Thank you.</i>

297
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:52,412
<i>- There's a ton of peanuts.
- They're not hot.</i>

298
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:55,418
- "They're not hot."
- Excuse me?

299
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,421
<i>Uh, could I borrow
that coin you have there?</i>

300
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:00,855
Yeah.

301
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,790
Watch this.

302
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:06,091
If I take your cigarette
and hold it up to your quarter...

303
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:09,963
it'll seem to be sticking to it...

304
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,127
just like that.

305
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:15,172
<i>And if we keep turning it, it'll look like...</i>

306
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:18,765
The cigarette's penetrating the quarter,
just like that.

307
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:21,744
Could you, um,
take this lighter here...

308
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:23,814
<i>- and, uh, light it up?
- It'll give you cancer.</i>

309
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,815
It's for effect. It's okay.

310
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:29,284
Okay.

311
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:31,582
You may have relatives in ze old country.

312
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,590
This is the best part of all.

313
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:35,853
If we take the cigarette
and start to remove it...

314
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:41,991
the quarter will seem
to, um, seal itself up.

315
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,330
- Whoo!
- That's great!

316
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,870
That's great. That's fantastic.

317
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:49,270
Thank you.
Have you ever seen a quarter...

318
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:51,899
that, um, allows a cigarette
to go through it?

319
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:55,207
- No.
- Well, there's no such thing.

320
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:02,817
- Now what about my peanuts?
- I've got that taken care of.

321
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:04,946
Come over here.

322
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:20,062
<i>Smart aleck.!</i>

323
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:29,838
<i>Uh, pick a card. Any card. It don't matter.</i>

324
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:34,718
Come on. L-I gotta go.
Show's about to start.

325
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:38,846
- Uh-huh. You gonna be part of it, Carne?
- Ain't you gonna pick one?

326
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,251
Free Will Baptist.
We never touch 'em.

327
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:47,695
I use 'em all the time in my work.

328
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:50,063
<i>Helps break the ice
for my customers.</i>

329
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:57,337
<i>This always happens to me. Always.</i>

330
00:27:57,442 --> 00:28:01,503
Aw, come on, Pet. You're always
looking for that kind of guy, right?

331
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:04,377
I mean, what you have to say is,
"Fuck 'em."

332
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:08,612
Listen, ifJackson shows up,
tell him I went home.

333
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:15,349
Me too. Ed was on the platform.
I bet the shit missed the train.

334
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,923
Hey, remember me?

335
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:28,797
Alana, come on.

336
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:31,671
I said I was sorry, and I meant it.

337
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:35,109
- It was stupid to let you think it was my...
- It's not that.

338
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:39,912
Well, would you mind
telling me why you're so upset?

339
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:43,749
You let him set you up again.
Mo, you're worth 10 of him.

340
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:46,221
Just because you belong to
the same stupid fraternity...

341
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:49,418
Hey, hey, I happen to like
this fraternity, okay?

342
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:51,495
You don't get it. You have no idea
what I'm trying to tell you.

343
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:54,087
Oh, yes, I do.

344
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:56,929
I understand, Alana.

345
00:28:57,035 --> 00:29:01,631
You have just never forgiven him for setting
you up with Kenny in the frat house.

346
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,300
You've always gotta be
Little Miss Perfect.

347
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,537
Look, I'm not gonna sit here and listen
to you cover for him all night, all right?

348
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:09,704
<i>Alana, please.!</i>

349
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:11,805
I know Doc
can be a jerk sometimes.

350
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,816
<i>I'm not stupid.</i>

351
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:16,648
<i>- Doc's my friend.
- You don't need an enemy, then.</i>

352
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:20,691
Very funny. Did you think
of that one all by yourself?

353
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,362
Excuse me.

354
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:32,126
<i>You pulled what?</i>

355
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:35,206
I didn't know
there was a muscle there.

356
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:37,536
- Oh, excuse me, sir.
- Okay.

357
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:42,378
<i>- Uh, just a minute there.
- Yeah?</i>

358
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,539
- Got a little trick I'd like to show you.
- Oh, great.

359
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:47,447
- Okay.
- Now, think on a card.

360
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:50,180
- Oh, now, don't tell me.
- You got it?

361
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:53,655
You got to concentrate
on the deck...

362
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:58,661
because it's the power of the thought
that makes it rise to the top.

363
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:01,561
<i>Let me show you
how to do that.</i>

364
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,964
Five.

365
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,535
Four.

366
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:12,141
Three. There it is.

367
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:14,143
Now, what...
what was your card?

368
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:21,318
- Jack of hearts.
- Not only has it risen to the top of the deck...

369
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:24,684
but now, it has become
the jack of spades.

370
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:27,223
Nice one, sir.

371
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:32,189
Just a gag.
Kind of clever, wasn't it?

372
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:36,829
I'm gonna wet my pants
if I don't stop laughing.

373
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:39,802
- Emergency!
- Emergency room, right here.

374
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,599
- Locked.
- Oh!

375
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:43,606
- There's another one down
at the end of the car here.
- Thanks.

376
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:46,541
- We'll just, uh, sit this one out.
- I can't wait.

377
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:49,272
Now, you tell the good doctor
just what's troubling you.

378
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,348
Come here.

379
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:06,923
My, that was pretty.

380
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,988
<i>- Very well done.
- You know how he does it?</i>

381
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,499
- Yeah.
- How?

382
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,168
We're sworn to secrecy.

383
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:14,820
<i>Hey.!</i>

384
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:17,918
- Where is everybody?
- Watching the magician.

385
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,395
- Where the hell areJackson and Ed?
- I don't know.

386
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:23,695
Hey, wait a minute.
We didn't hire a magician.

387
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:26,429
Well, maybe somebody else
had a good idea for a change, hmm?

388
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:29,028
I wanna see what he does.

389
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,267
Isn't she adorable?

390
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,914
She still mad?

391
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,714
Yeah, she's still mad.

392
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:45,255
She'll get over it.

393
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,881
You know, Doc...

394
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:49,892
I'm not so sure this time.

395
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,855
Well, if she dumps you,
you've always got me, you know.

396
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:59,266
I mean it.

397
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,788
Whoo!

398
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:03,463
Let's get out of here.

399
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:06,602
Excuse me.

400
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:08,763
Watch your toes, Mitchy.

401
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:12,036
Uh, what's with the snit sisters?

402
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:14,634
Wait a minute.
Excuse me.

403
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:17,509
One of my girlfriends thinks her boyfriend
was left back at the platform...

404
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:21,107
<i>- before we left.
- Oh, I don't think so, not if he came with you all.</i>

405
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:23,619
<i>The platform was clear.</i>

406
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:25,712
You know...

407
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:31,521
<i>they might've... they might've
switched disguises.</i>

408
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:34,029
- You know, it'd be hard to tell.
- You talking about Ed?

409
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,066
- Yeah.
- He's here. I saw him.

410
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:38,635
<i>- He's in the Groucho costume.
- He's here?</i>

411
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:40,499
Yeah.

412
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:42,505
- I'm sorry. False alarm.
- It's all right.

413
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,801
Hey, guys.

414
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:48,310
You should've seen that magician.
He was fantastic.

415
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:50,744
Poof! Just like that,
the woman was gone.

416
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:53,339
Think he knows
how to make one come?

417
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:56,545
- I hate magic. It's just tricks.
- Come on. You love tricks.

418
00:35:56,654 --> 00:36:00,420
- I love jokes.
- You're just pissed off'cause you can't figure it out.

419
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:06,329
These girls look faint.

420
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,330
Can we do anything
to revive them?

421
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:11,162
I don't know.
Maybe some kind of injection?

422
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:14,534
You girls better come back
to the consulting room with us.

423
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:17,107
<i>We may have
to do an exploratory.</i>

424
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:20,871
<i>- Yeah, you sure you guys have had any experience?
- Experience? Us?</i>

425
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:23,446
Oh, come on. Tell 'em, Doc.
We got experience.

426
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:26,949
Mo and I worked in an emergency
gynecological ward last summer.

427
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:29,281
- Really?
- Yeah, that's right. Doc won an award.

428
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:31,514
Best Pap smear in a supporting role.
Come on.

429
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:49,629
Let's go get some champagne.

430
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,140
Uh, I wanna stay here, okay?

431
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:54,871
- Enjoy yourselves.
- Thank you.

432
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:57,948
- Let's dance.
- What about the men?

433
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:01,815
The men can obviously
take care of themselves.

434
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,571
- I feel sick.
- This little lady cannot hold her liquor.

435
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:29,805
But there's something else
I can hold.

436
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,814
<i>Anyway, when in doubt, cut it out, right?</i>

437
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,043
Or cut it off.
Hey, hey, come on.

438
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:36,051
- Not in there.
- Not again!

439
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:39,611
Anyway, we look in the jar,
and there's the tattoo around the nipple.

440
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:42,921
- Oh, stop!
- Uh-oh. This one looks serious, Doc.

441
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:47,589
I agree. Get her in here.
Aw, shit, it's still locked.

442
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:50,792
- Uh-oh. Look who's here.
- Oh, hi. Hi.

443
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:53,267
<i>Medical problem.
You think it's serious?</i>

444
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:56,534
Smells like an alcohol problem to me.

445
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:58,905
We know you can handle it, Captain.

446
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,638
Come on.
Get out of here.

447
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,750
Anybody in there?

448
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:12,953
Speak up if you're in there.
Otherwise, I'm gonna use the passkey.

449
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,586
All right, I'm coming in.

450
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,399
My God.

451
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:20,947
If you wanna talk,
we can go back to my compartment.

452
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:23,322
- It's quiet there.
- Probably very private too...

453
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:26,260
with red lights and satin sheets.

454
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,424
- Mood music.
- Yeah, I had the pledges install a hot tub.

455
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,558
- It's very nice.
- Mmm!

456
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:35,571
Seriously. If you wanna talk,
I'm around, okay?

457
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:39,302
- You really have a hot tub?
- Oh, geez.

458
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,373
You all right?

459
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:14,603
You got somethin' to put in this?

460
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:16,680
Are you sick?

461
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:24,981
There's a boy dead back there.
He's in the sleeper toilet.

462
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,887
He must have...
I don't know what happened.

463
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:29,926
L-I just don't know.

464
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:31,927
No doubt in your mind?

465
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:34,224
Oh, he's dead, all right.

466
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:38,132
I never saw anybody
so dead as that.

467
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:40,965
I gotta sit down, Charlie,
for a minute.

468
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:48,172
Will you watch that car
while I call Walter?

469
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,247
Of course.

470
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:56,179
Uh, nobody knows, so...

471
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:59,552
- don't say nothin'.
- Sure.

472
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,623
Hi, guys.

473
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:06,093
Oh, where have you been
all my life?

474
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:08,563
Just this once.

475
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:25,507
Well, I can say
we crossed the line.

476
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:27,709
Oh, we can back into town,
sure we can.

477
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:30,309
But that'll green
that switch and that freight...

478
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:33,822
and we'll be backing up a hell of
a lot slower than he'll be coming towards us.

479
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:36,552
I guess the closest way out
is straight ahead.

480
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,094
Is all hell breaking loose
back there or what?

481
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:41,858
Just an accident.

482
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:44,127
Let's put on a little speed.

483
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:22,462
<i>Can you believe that guy?</i>

484
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:25,872
Yeah, but do you know
what he asked me to do? Oh, hi.

485
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:28,342
<i>- Could I get in there?
- I'm sorry. It's out of order.</i>

486
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:31,380
- Would you try the other side, please?
Thank you very much.
- Okay.

487
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:47,822
- Did you look?
- No, sir.

488
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:51,390
Sorry to put this on you, Charlie.

489
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,070
<i>What?</i>

490
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:08,949
What the hell?
There was blood there before.

491
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:10,987
<i>I could've sworn it.</i>

492
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,454
Something's happened.

493
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:17,493
<i>Some kind of practical joke.</i>

494
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:29,096
Dead drunk. That's what he is.

495
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:32,300
<i>Whoops-a-daisy.!</i>

496
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:34,639
<i>Damn kids.</i>

497
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:37,270
All right, up.
Come on. Up we go.

498
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:40,817
Whoops!
Bad choo-choo.

499
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,583
Oh, wow. D-Jack!

500
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:50,524
Do you know how gross that looks
when you're stoned?

501
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,528
Were you in here all this time?

502
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,827
<i>Were you sick?
He gets, you know, sick.</i>

503
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:58,629
I guess so.

504
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:02,365
Well, look, folks,
he's a-walkin' and a-talkin'.

505
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:05,874
Weighs a ton.
At least that's what his girlfriend says.

506
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:09,104
I mean, you know what I mean.

507
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:11,204
Oh, he'll be all right.
I'll take care of him.

508
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:14,512
<i>Easy does it, right, Jack?</i>

509
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:16,984
<i>That's a boy.</i>

510
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:19,351
Damn medical students.

511
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:24,151
- Oh, no. No, no.
- So, are you breaking up with Alana?

512
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:27,890
- Only for the weekend.
- But I thought you two were getting married.

513
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,296
- We are.
- Hey. Whoa.

514
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:33,268
- Hey, guys, a little booze. A little booze.
- Thank you.

515
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,429
A toast to us.

516
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:37,598
- Hey, there's Jackson.
- The old yearbook.

517
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:39,573
<i>- Let me see.
- Hey, look at Mo.</i>

518
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,577
- I look like an idiot.
- Well, you still do.

519
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,113
- Thanks a lot, old buddy.
- That's the Prez.

520
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:46,341
Who's that?

521
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:48,350
<i>That's just Kenny Hampson.</i>

522
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:51,216
He couldn't handle it.

523
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:55,018
Say, sweetheart,
let's take a walk.

524
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:59,061
Hey, Doc, where are you goin'?
Doc, don't leave me alone...

525
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:01,688
Hi. Hey, Ed,
is that you down there?

526
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,958
Boo!

527
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:07,970
D-Jack, you can make it.

528
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:12,736
Up! I mean, if you've never tried
an upper berth before...

529
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:14,708
Scoot!

530
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,481
You old faker.

531
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:24,986
Jackson's with another girl.
I know it.

532
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:27,819
You and Mitchy, you know,
you have an understanding.

533
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:30,450
But this is a first for us.

534
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,921
Could be a first for us too.

535
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:40,303
Right?

536
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:43,929
Like, uh...

537
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:46,134
you and I have never
really gotten to know each other...

538
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:50,543
and, uh, could be
our last chance.

539
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:55,183
Right, D-Jack?

540
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,157
Think, uh, you could manage
without the flipper?

541
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,638
Ooh.

542
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:29,150
Well, uh, you know what they say:

543
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:31,881
Cold hands, warm heart.

544
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,467
<i>I don't wanna get involved
in any controversy...</i>

545
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:54,476
<i>on the situation
in the Middle East...</i>

546
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:58,446
but as senior senator from my state,
I think I can speak for my constituents...

547
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:02,679
indeed all Americans,
when I say, "Fuck 'em!"

548
00:47:02,786 --> 00:47:04,686
You know, there are certain phrases
in American history...

549
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:08,315
<i>that have caught the fancy
of the American people.</i>

550
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:12,828
The phrase that's always caught my fancy
or aroused me as it were is...

551
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:15,763
"Let's bomb them suckers
into the Stone Age."

552
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:17,993
<i>You know,
it wouldn't be like Vietnam.</i>

553
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:21,901
They don't have no jungle to hide under.
Just sand and rock.

554
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:24,371
To my way of thinkin',
if the United States Cavalry...

555
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:27,773
<i>can take care of Paiutes
and Comanches...</i>

556
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:31,211
a B-52 ought to do just fine
with those camel jockeys.

557
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:34,580
- Of course, this is strictly
off the record, you understand.
- Yeah, sure.

558
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:37,654
Of course, you're all aware
of my campaign platform...

559
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:41,747
<i>which is a return to the gold standard,
euthanasia for all welfare recipients...</i>

560
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:46,455
<i>and six NFL franchises,
each with its own stadium,
for the state of Louisiana.</i>

561
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:51,262
<i>And our campaign slogan...
Let them eat brownies. What's that, ma'am?</i>

562
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:59,036
- I liked your show.
- I remember you.

563
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:03,604
Do you believe in magic?

564
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,774
I'll have to convince you.

565
00:48:20,797 --> 00:48:24,130
- Do you do this for all your fans?
- This is my first time, Alana.

566
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:30,137
<i>After the next show.</i>

567
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,970
<i>Alana?</i>

568
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:39,406
Mo's waiting for you.

569
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:42,280
He said to tell you
he's sorry, and so am I.

570
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:48,124
- You seen Mitchy?
- I thought she was with you.

571
00:48:48,225 --> 00:48:50,284
I must have missed her.

572
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:53,488
Anyway, go talk to the guy.

573
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,565
He doesn't wanna argue.

574
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,568
Thanks.

575
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:05,767
<i>- Mo?
- What?</i>

576
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:08,208
<i>Here, Mo.</i>

577
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:12,009
Thank you. Do you know
they drink out of these things?

578
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:15,175
- Why don't you come join me, Mo?
- No, I'll stay here.

579
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:18,721
- Come on. Does that mean I have to come to you?
- Mm-hmm.

580
00:49:18,822 --> 00:49:20,722
<i>- Hey, you wanna dance?
- No, I'll just watch.</i>

581
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:22,883
- Come on.
- No, no, that's okay.

582
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:25,484
You wanna watch, eh?
What do you wanna see?

583
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:30,365
- Oh, let's dance.
- No, I don't wanna dance.

584
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:32,662
<i>- Come on.
- No, that's okay.</i>

585
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:36,637
- Does that mean you wanna do something else?
- No, no, no! I'll dance.

586
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:39,368
- Oh, you're so cute.
- Hey, hey, no. Come on. Stop it.

587
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:42,809
- Will you let go of my pants?
- Uh-oh.

588
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:45,882
You're...

589
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:55,457
What happened to that blood?

590
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:04,198
And how the hell
did he bust that mirror?

591
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:09,237
With a hammer?

592
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:12,399
<i>Shuffled. Laid on the floor. There.</i>

593
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:17,674
Not only will I find the card that was selected
and signed by our skeptical friend here...

594
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:21,273
but, uh, I'm gonna do it...

595
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:23,046
without looking.

596
00:50:23,153 --> 00:50:27,852
- That's third-grade stuff.
- Really?

597
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,357
<i>Oh, he's getting violent. That's pretty sharp.</i>

598
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:36,298
<i>What's he got?</i>

599
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:38,221
<i>My God.</i>

600
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:39,311
Are you okay?

601
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:41,686
Do you know whose this is?

602
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:45,420
Yeah, it's Mitchy's. Michelle,
my girlfriend. I'll take it. Thank you.

603
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:48,898
Don't.

604
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,507
- What's going on?
- Will you go with me, please?

605
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:03,170
- Where'd you find this?
- Let's go, miss, please.

606
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:06,282
Come on.

607
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:10,786
I'm not letting you out.

608
00:53:10,887 --> 00:53:13,287
- Will you at least put your clothes on, please?
- No.

609
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,585
- But we're missing the magic show.
- Boring.

610
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:19,184
- No, no, not boring. Fun. Fun, fun, fun.
- Boring.

611
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:21,958
<i>- Mitchy? Mo?
- Oh, my God. It's Alana.</i>

612
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:24,898
I know he's in there.
Doc told me so.

613
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:27,026
<i>- Doc?
- Mitchy?</i>

614
00:53:27,137 --> 00:53:30,197
<i>- That fuckin' bastard!
- I have an office.</i>

615
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:34,744
- It's in the car up ahead. Now come on. Come on.
- Mo?

616
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:38,371
Sit down and stay put.

617
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:47,414
Mitchy? Mitchy?

618
00:53:47,524 --> 00:53:51,620
- Miss, sit down.
- Now just wait a minute.
Has something happened to her?

619
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:55,721
- She didn't fall off the train, did she?
- No, ma'am.

620
00:53:55,832 --> 00:53:58,926
Now listen to me, honey.

621
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:01,003
She's dead.

622
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:10,277
I don't believe you.
I don't believe you!

623
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,644
Hey, anyone can do that!

624
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:16,082
Well, rather than argue with you...

625
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:18,347
<i>I'm going to prove
that you're right.</i>

626
00:54:18,455 --> 00:54:21,618
- Have you seen Alana?
- No.

627
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:24,660
Bullshit, you haven't!
I wanna talk to you.

628
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,786
Hey, relax. Watch the show.

629
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:37,366
I didn't get caught, okay?

630
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:40,170
You made a mistake.

631
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:42,245
It can't be Mitchy.

632
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:47,674
- She's my goddamned best friend.
- Please, please.

633
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:53,946
Oh, God. Mitchy!

634
00:54:57,594 --> 00:54:59,562
Oh, no.

635
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:06,496
<i>We're gonna try a little mental telepathy.</i>

636
00:55:06,603 --> 00:55:10,539
First, you're gonna cover me with a cloth
so I can't see you.

637
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,473
Then hold up as many fingers
as you want behind my head.

638
00:55:12,508 --> 00:55:14,306
Then hold up as many fingers
as you want behind my head.

639
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:16,470
<i>- Hey, you seen Mitchy?
- On my command, pull away the cloth...</i>

640
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:20,481
<i>- and I'll be holding up
the exact same number of fingers.
- She's around somewhere.</i>

641
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:23,518
<i>Okay, cover me up.</i>

642
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:27,420
<i>Hey, why don't you stay under there.!</i>

643
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:33,228
<i>Can anybody make him disappear?</i>

644
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:35,195
<i>Shall we begin?</i>

645
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:42,164
<i>Good. Now hold your fingers up.</i>

646
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:44,797
<i>Are you sure
that's the number you want?</i>

647
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:48,002
<i>Then take hold
of the cloth. Ready?</i>

648
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:52,207
<i>- Wake me when it's over.!
- One, two, three.</i>

649
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:54,340
<i>Go.</i>

650
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:02,957
Seven.

651
00:56:15,071 --> 00:56:17,096
Who did that to her?

652
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:21,803
Probably some kid
messed up on dope.

653
00:56:21,911 --> 00:56:23,970
Alcohol.

654
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:27,811
I know these people.
They wouldn't do that.

655
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:30,351
No, of course not.

656
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:33,616
Probably some nut
just climbed on the train.

657
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:38,126
<i>I saw her half an hour ago
with a fella...</i>

658
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,128
fallin' down...

659
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:43,299
drunk.

660
00:56:44,768 --> 00:56:46,998
SweetJesus.

661
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:50,095
At the end of my last show, I, uh...

662
00:56:50,206 --> 00:56:53,437
<i>dematerialized my assistant.</i>

663
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:58,870
Well, for my next show,
I'm gonna need to have her back.

664
00:56:58,982 --> 00:57:00,950
So, watch.

665
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:22,201
<i>- Wake up, buddy. It's over.
- Thank you.</i>

666
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:24,364
<i>- Hey.
- Thank you.</i>

667
00:57:24,474 --> 00:57:26,601
Oh, that's a good one.
That's a good one.

668
00:57:26,709 --> 00:57:28,768
You're great. Thank you.

669
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:32,109
Get up. Come on, Mo.
Come on.

670
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:36,977
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

671
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:39,281
Mo?

672
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:41,516
<i>Mo?</i>

673
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:44,252
Mo?

674
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:47,887
Mo, get up.
Mo, wake up. Help!

675
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:52,128
Wake up. Help!

676
00:57:53,903 --> 00:57:56,303
Help me, please!

677
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:01,306
Get up!

678
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:08,179
<i>- Help! Please!
- Nice gag, Doc.</i>

679
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:12,648
<i>Help me.</i>

680
00:58:12,755 --> 00:58:14,689
<i>Please!</i>

681
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:21,858
Somebody, help me!
He's bleeding, you bastards!

682
00:58:21,965 --> 00:58:23,660
<i>Help.!</i>

683
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:26,234
- Doc?
- Help him.

684
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:31,171
- Put him down. Put him down.
- Mo? Mo? What's wrong with him?

685
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:33,003
- Get back.
- Mo?

686
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:36,044
<i>Come on. I need this from you now. Come on, Mo.</i>

687
00:58:36,145 --> 00:58:38,204
Alana, come look at his chest.

688
00:58:38,314 --> 00:58:40,578
- He's bleeding.
- Could be his heart.

689
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:42,708
- It's not his fucking heart!
- Come on!

690
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:45,287
<i>- Come on, Mo. Come on.
- Get back.</i>

691
00:58:45,388 --> 00:58:48,289
- Give him some air.
- I'm a doctor, goddamn it.

692
00:58:48,391 --> 00:58:51,383
Mo. Oh, no! No!

693
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:53,758
Oh, come on, Mo.

694
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:56,127
<i>Come on, buddy.</i>

695
00:58:56,232 --> 00:58:59,099
<i>- Come on. Come on.
- What is going on?</i>

696
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:01,636
- Get 'em out of here!
- Mo.

697
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:05,139
Move it!

698
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:08,142
Get 'em all down there together
and close that bar.

699
00:59:17,253 --> 00:59:20,450
Where's Mitchy?
Where is she?

700
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:23,923
She's dead.

701
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:25,995
Mitchy's dead.

702
00:59:29,198 --> 00:59:31,530
What are you talking about?

703
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:36,301
- She's dead.
- Mitchy!

704
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:40,399
Mitchy! Mitchy!

705
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:42,501
I'm getting out of here.

706
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:46,677
Brace yourself.
We're gonna lock up.

707
00:59:55,858 --> 00:59:57,689
Walter.

708
00:59:57,794 --> 01:00:01,525
My God, what's the matter with Walter?
He should have hit the brakes.

709
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:18,280
Emergency!

710
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:38,500
We're gonna derail!
Ease off on the brakes!

711
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:47,869
Brakes, now.

712
01:00:53,116 --> 01:00:55,880
Stop, damn you. Stop.

713
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:47,065
What the hell happened here?

714
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:49,070
<i>I don't know.</i>

715
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:53,141
He must have got 'em both.

716
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:59,242
Don't go back through
that train without this.

717
01:01:59,348 --> 01:02:03,944
Watch your step there.
Stay together. Don't go too far.

718
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:06,613
Come on. Keep on moving,
everybody. Come on.

719
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:12,127
Get yourselves a couple of fire axes
and search every damn inch of these cars.

720
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:16,062
He could be anywhere.
And he's lethal, so stick together.

721
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:18,395
And don't try to be heroes.

722
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:21,299
If you just think you hear somethin',
you come hollerin' for help.

723
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:23,304
Okay, chief.

724
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:28,207
Keep moving.
Watch your step, please.

725
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:30,245
- Hey, careful there.
- Stay together.

726
01:02:30,346 --> 01:02:32,814
Christ, the lights are gone.

727
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:58,005
Everybody, take off your masks.

728
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:01,372
<i>- I wanna know who's who.
- Tell us what's going on.</i>

729
01:03:01,477 --> 01:03:04,002
I will. Right now,
I'm telling you...

730
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:07,276
to stay with your dates,
stick by your friends.

731
01:03:07,383 --> 01:03:09,851
Elaine? Dominic?

732
01:03:18,027 --> 01:03:19,927
Look out!

733
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:24,198
<i>It's one of them little mothers.</i>

734
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,825
<i>- Hey, asshole.
- Jackson?</i>

735
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:30,167
<i>- Jackson?
- If this turns out to be another one of your stunts...</i>

736
01:03:30,273 --> 01:03:33,174
<i>Hey, you there, let go ofhim.</i>

737
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,775
<i>- Herbie Green?
- Okay?</i>

738
01:03:36,879 --> 01:03:39,177
<i>Dan Irwin?</i>

739
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:44,276
<i>I want the rest
of those masks off now. Hurry along there.</i>

740
01:03:44,387 --> 01:03:47,845
- How come it's just all my best friends
in the fucking world?
- What do we all have in common?

741
01:03:47,957 --> 01:03:50,892
- Jackson.
- You and me and Mitchy and the guys?

742
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:54,520
Doc, we hurt him.

743
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:58,760
- What are you talking about?
- Kenny Hampson. Your stunt with the corpse.

744
01:03:58,868 --> 01:04:01,234
Nobody'd do that
for a goddamn prank.

745
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:04,738
It wasn't just a prank.
Doc, he was sick.

746
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:10,006
I went to the hospital
just afterwards.

747
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:12,103
They wouldn't let me see him.

748
01:04:12,215 --> 01:04:14,149
They said he'd killed
somebody before.

749
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:17,151
And they said it might have been
an accident, but he killed somebody.

750
01:04:21,924 --> 01:04:23,892
Shit.

751
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:27,262
And we're next, aren't we?

752
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:33,067
- Come on.
- No.

753
01:04:42,912 --> 01:04:44,812
<i>- Come on! Come on!
- I am.!</i>

754
01:04:44,914 --> 01:04:48,179
I'm trying to save your life,
for Christ's sake.

755
01:04:48,284 --> 01:04:51,742
Get going.
Here goes nothing.

756
01:04:51,854 --> 01:04:53,754
Now listen to me.

757
01:04:53,856 --> 01:04:56,552
I don't wanna
get back on that train.

758
01:04:56,659 --> 01:05:00,026
Nobody does.

759
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:04,930
But we have no choice.
Nobody can make it if we stay up here.

760
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:12,804
Couldn't find a thing.

761
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:16,777
Come on.
We can't get on that train.

762
01:05:16,879 --> 01:05:20,872
<i>There are no roads up here.
Now, we'll put you all in one car.</i>

763
01:05:20,983 --> 01:05:23,383
With the killer!

764
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:25,386
Bullshit. We can walk.

765
01:05:25,488 --> 01:05:27,752
You'll die.

766
01:05:27,857 --> 01:05:29,882
At this temperature, you'll die.

767
01:05:29,992 --> 01:05:33,155
What do you think you're doing?
He could be in here.

768
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:37,062
<i>Lock, damn you.</i>

769
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:42,469
Fuckin' animal.

770
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:44,596
He can't do this to me.

771
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:48,871
If you can keep your head while all about you
are losing theirs and blaming it on you.

772
01:05:48,978 --> 01:05:51,674
We are gonna die
unless we get some help!

773
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:53,908
But I don't know who to trust anymore.

774
01:05:54,016 --> 01:05:56,849
I don't even trust you.

775
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,921
You're so slow.

776
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:12,964
Presto "chango." The same little shit.
Good old Kenny Hampson.

777
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:17,828
I knew I never liked magic.

778
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:19,931
The magician?

779
01:06:20,042 --> 01:06:23,671
We'll sit tight and when the train stops,
we'll play a trick on old Kenny.

780
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:27,875
- The train is stopped.
- Then they better start it up again
'cause it's gonna...

781
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:31,977
- He's back there with all of our friends!
- Let's hope so, huh?

782
01:06:32,088 --> 01:06:34,886
I don't believe you.

783
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:38,392
He's gonna kill everybody!
We've gotta tell them!

784
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:40,394
I'm not movin'.

785
01:06:43,566 --> 01:06:45,466
Every man for himself.

786
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:52,531
Alana, don't.

787
01:06:52,641 --> 01:06:55,132
- Don't!
- Let go of me!

788
01:06:55,244 --> 01:06:58,543
Doc! Doc!

789
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:00,512
Please. Doc!

790
01:07:00,616 --> 01:07:02,140
Doc!

791
01:07:02,251 --> 01:07:03,411
Doc!

792
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:07,345
<i>Hey, you there.!</i>

793
01:07:07,456 --> 01:07:10,391
Go back outside, miss.

794
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:13,428
<i>Please?</i>

795
01:07:36,752 --> 01:07:38,720
Oh, shit.

796
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:53,648
No! No!

797
01:09:57,326 --> 01:09:59,294
Help!

798
01:10:10,272 --> 01:10:12,263
Mitchy.

799
01:10:14,109 --> 01:10:16,236
Oh, Jesus Christ.

800
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:22,943
It's a joke.
A goddamn practical joke.

801
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:29,491
We're the brothers of Sigma Phi Omega, right?
Brothers, remember?

802
01:10:29,592 --> 01:10:33,585
That means we're gonna stick together.
We're gonna look out for each other.

803
01:10:33,696 --> 01:10:37,462
<i>- We're gonna protect each other.
Now get on the train.
- Have you seen the conductor?</i>

804
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:40,694
Anybody seen the conductor?

805
01:10:40,803 --> 01:10:42,862
- I know who it is.
- What?

806
01:10:42,972 --> 01:10:45,634
- Where's the conductor?
- Back there. Come on.

807
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:54,078
God, it was cold out there.
My feet are numb.

808
01:10:54,183 --> 01:10:56,151
I told you to stay in the car.

809
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:59,847
Well, they made me get off.
I mean, they had to search here.

810
01:11:04,526 --> 01:11:07,324
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is something missing?

811
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:11,990
<i>Geez, I was scared out there.</i>

812
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:17,368
I couldn't find you, and I'm thinking
this wacko's gonna jump out at me any minute.

813
01:11:17,473 --> 01:11:19,941
Hey, I should have
used one of these.

814
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,079
Yeah, this would have done.
What do you think?

815
01:11:26,348 --> 01:11:30,307
- Let's go back, Alana. They'll be coming back.
- Doc?

816
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:33,354
- It's okay. I'm with the prez.
- Damn it.

817
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:41,187
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

818
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:44,630
Well, whatever.
Have you ever shoveled any coal?

819
01:11:44,733 --> 01:11:46,633
- No.
- He's on the train.

820
01:11:46,735 --> 01:11:50,193
- Why isn't she lying down somewhere?
- The magician!

821
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:53,742
- Magician?
- I'll show you. Come on.

822
01:11:53,842 --> 01:11:55,969
Doc's got the picture.

823
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:04,646
<i>Doc, open up.</i>

824
01:12:04,753 --> 01:12:08,189
<i>Open up in there, please.</i>

825
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:10,258
<i>Doc?</i>

826
01:12:11,293 --> 01:12:14,319
<i>Doc? I just left him in there.</i>

827
01:12:35,884 --> 01:12:38,409
Keep her outside.

828
01:13:06,081 --> 01:13:08,208
Don't go in there, miss.

829
01:14:15,083 --> 01:14:17,142
<i>Doc.!</i>

830
01:14:35,771 --> 01:14:38,467
You move out real quiet, darlin'.

831
01:14:38,574 --> 01:14:42,010
Hey, what's going on?

832
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:45,602
We got the coffee maker workin', miss.

833
01:14:45,714 --> 01:14:48,239
Come on.

834
01:14:52,754 --> 01:14:56,554
<i>- Where is he?
- He's right back there.</i>

835
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:59,024
Come on.

836
01:14:59,127 --> 01:15:01,027
Ken?

837
01:15:01,129 --> 01:15:05,031
<i>They made coffee out here.
I'll bring you in a cup, okay?</i>

838
01:15:14,443 --> 01:15:16,968
What's going on, for Christ sake?
What's happening, huh?

839
01:15:17,079 --> 01:15:19,912
This is only for your own safety.

840
01:15:34,162 --> 01:15:37,427
I guess nobody's been in this one
for a couple of years.

841
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:41,128
You'll be able
to get some rest, yes, sir.

842
01:15:46,441 --> 01:15:49,968
It's a little dusty in here,
but it's clean.

843
01:15:50,078 --> 01:15:52,103
Come on in.

844
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:07,957
- I hope you don't mind
no sheets and no pillowcases.
- No.

845
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,963
- I'll get you some, though.
- No, please.

846
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:13,728
Okay, okay, don't worry.
I won't leave this car.

847
01:16:13,835 --> 01:16:16,167
I'm gonna be
right outside that door.

848
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:24,795
Come on now. Let us go, you guys.

849
01:17:24,906 --> 01:17:28,034
Out of my fucking way.

850
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:30,976
- Let me through!
- What did you say, boy?

851
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:34,606
- Say that again.
- Let us through or we'll break the door down.

852
01:17:34,716 --> 01:17:37,446
Shut up, all of you.

853
01:17:37,552 --> 01:17:41,488
I said, move off, sir.

854
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:44,354
He killed a couple of ours.

855
01:17:44,459 --> 01:17:46,359
You aim to kill him?

856
01:17:50,198 --> 01:17:52,166
Give me the ax.

857
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:56,365
Before you go...

858
01:17:56,471 --> 01:17:59,235
you take a look at the bodies
of some of your friends.

859
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:01,866
Is it worth that, son?

860
01:18:04,246 --> 01:18:06,806
Well, is it worth it?

861
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:24,191
I'll check it out myself.

862
01:18:58,166 --> 01:19:00,066
Hey, Ken.

863
01:19:01,503 --> 01:19:03,937
<i>Come on out here.
I wanna talk to you.</i>

864
01:19:05,707 --> 01:19:09,302
Gotta turn the heat off back there.
You wanna come up to the lounge?

865
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:12,941
<i>Gonna turn the lights off too.</i>

866
01:21:46,434 --> 01:21:48,698
<i>No.</i>

867
01:21:48,803 --> 01:21:51,567
No. No.

868
01:23:14,422 --> 01:23:16,549
Stop!

869
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:58,355
Kenny.

870
01:24:02,337 --> 01:24:03,702
Kenny!

871
01:24:07,942 --> 01:24:09,603
<i>Kenny, please.</i>

872
01:25:24,652 --> 01:25:27,280
What happened?

873
01:25:27,388 --> 01:25:29,515
He killed Mo.

874
01:25:32,227 --> 01:25:34,388
<i>- Clear out!
- Get out of the way, you guys.</i>

875
01:25:34,496 --> 01:25:37,465
<i>- Back up!
- Come on. Back up, damn it.</i>

876
01:25:37,565 --> 01:25:39,931
Get out of the way.
Come on!

877
01:25:40,034 --> 01:25:42,525
Clear the way back there.

878
01:26:19,541 --> 01:26:22,738
We'll be there in about 15 minutes.
Would you like a cup of coffee?

879
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:24,812
No, thanks.

880
01:27:53,735 --> 01:27:56,260
Hi. Listen, why don't you
come on back now.

881
01:27:56,371 --> 01:28:00,137
It's mellowed out and, well,
this place gives me the creeps.

882
01:28:01,342 --> 01:28:03,242
Okay.

883
01:28:42,417 --> 01:28:45,113
Why don't you come back
and join the...

884
01:28:45,219 --> 01:28:47,619
Join us. Come on.

885
01:29:04,906 --> 01:29:06,874
There's the light.

886
01:29:08,109 --> 01:29:11,169
Lord, that's beautiful.

887
01:29:12,847 --> 01:29:16,283
Go back and start the report,
Charlie. I'll bring her on in.

888
01:29:16,384 --> 01:29:18,352
Okay.

889
01:29:21,322 --> 01:29:23,313
- Got it?
- I got her.

890
01:29:23,424 --> 01:29:25,392
Okay.

891
01:31:01,389 --> 01:31:03,414
What the hell?

892
01:31:07,061 --> 01:31:10,622
Hey, Alana.

893
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:20,066
Carne!

894
01:31:20,174 --> 01:31:23,007
Oh, thank God. Charlie.

895
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:28,475
The magician's dead.

896
01:31:29,951 --> 01:31:32,511
Jesus, I don't know
who it is anymore.

897
01:31:48,803 --> 01:31:50,498
No.

898
01:32:08,189 --> 01:32:10,657
It was you.

899
01:32:14,328 --> 01:32:16,888
Kenny, I'm sorry.

900
01:32:20,001 --> 01:32:22,834
I never told you,
I'm so sorry.

901
01:32:22,937 --> 01:32:25,735
You haven't changed.

902
01:32:29,343 --> 01:32:31,243
I saw your picture
in the yearbook.

903
01:32:31,345 --> 01:32:33,939
<i>I never knew you liked magic.</i>

904
01:32:34,048 --> 01:32:38,041
I watched you tonight.
You liked him.

905
01:32:38,152 --> 01:32:41,121
No.

906
01:32:41,222 --> 01:32:44,714
Kenny, you're better than he is.
I'm sure you're better than he is.

907
01:32:45,893 --> 01:32:47,724
I am.

908
01:32:47,828 --> 01:32:50,296
He didn't know how
to cut a woman into pieces.

909
01:32:50,398 --> 01:32:52,958
You don't have to do this.

910
01:32:53,067 --> 01:32:55,297
You don't have to do this.

911
01:32:55,403 --> 01:32:59,305
Kiss me, Alana.

912
01:32:59,407 --> 01:33:01,398
- Kiss me, Kenny.
- Kiss me.

913
01:33:01,509 --> 01:33:03,875
Kiss me.

914
01:33:03,978 --> 01:33:06,310
Kiss me.
