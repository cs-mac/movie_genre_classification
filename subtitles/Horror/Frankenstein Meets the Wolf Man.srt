1
00:03:25,952 --> 00:03:29,683
Lawrence Stewart Talbot,

2
00:03:29,756 --> 00:03:34,591
who died at the youthful
age of 31.

3
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:36,595
R.I.P.

4
00:03:38,465 --> 00:03:40,399
That's it.

5
00:03:40,467 --> 00:03:42,526
Give me the chisel.

6
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:49,237
Suppose they didn't bury him
with the money on him.

7
00:03:49,309 --> 00:03:51,243
Everybody in the village
knows about it...

8
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:54,144
his gold watch and ring
and money in his pockets.

9
00:03:54,214 --> 00:03:58,173
It's a sin to bury good money when
it could help people.

10
00:04:01,955 --> 00:04:04,082
This gives me the creeps.

11
00:04:04,157 --> 00:04:07,558
What do you think it will look
like after so many years?

12
00:04:07,627 --> 00:04:10,994
Just bones and an empty skull.

13
00:04:12,165 --> 00:04:14,360
Watch the lamp.

14
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,045
Get me the light.

15
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,934
Wolfbane.

16
00:04:49,002 --> 00:04:50,936
Wolfbane?

17
00:04:51,004 --> 00:04:52,938
Yes.

18
00:04:54,174 --> 00:04:57,234
Even a man who is
pure at heart...

19
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,507
and says his prayers by night...

20
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,878
may become a wolf...

21
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:05,509
when the wolfbane blooms...

22
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:07,917
and the moon is full and bright.

23
00:05:25,805 --> 00:05:27,796
<i>It looks like he's asleep.</i>

24
00:05:27,874 --> 00:05:30,240
Let's get on with it.
First the ring.

25
00:05:32,212 --> 00:05:35,045
We won't have to worry for a long time.
I thought the dead was stiff.

26
00:05:35,115 --> 00:05:37,049
Shut up.

27
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,554
Gold.

28
00:05:51,364 --> 00:05:53,298
It's holding me.

29
00:05:55,902 --> 00:05:57,836
Help me.
Help me.

30
00:05:57,904 --> 00:05:59,872
Alive.

31
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:01,804
Help, help!

32
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,244
Don't leave me!

33
00:06:35,975 --> 00:06:38,273
Here, now.
Come up.

34
00:06:40,847 --> 00:06:43,315
Come on. Wake up and
get along with you.

35
00:06:43,383 --> 00:06:45,544
You've got a home, haven't you?

36
00:06:45,618 --> 00:06:48,212
Or do you want me to
take you to the station?

37
00:06:58,131 --> 00:07:00,065
Good heavens!

38
00:07:17,484 --> 00:07:18,723
How is the patient, Nurse?

39
00:07:18,749 --> 00:07:20,273
He's conscious, Dr. Mannering.

40
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,118
And talked. He insists
upon sitting up.

41
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:25,123
Conscious? Talked?

42
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:27,659
But that's impossible so soon
after a critical operation.

43
00:07:45,712 --> 00:07:47,805
The nurse tells me
you're well enough to talk.

44
00:07:49,516 --> 00:07:51,575
Why, yes.

45
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:57,951
Pulse, 72, no fever.

46
00:08:01,795 --> 00:08:03,820
There's no pain?

47
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:07,032
No.

48
00:08:12,505 --> 00:08:14,939
Where am I?
Queen's Hospital.

49
00:08:16,576 --> 00:08:20,410
Queens?
Yes, Queen's Hospital in Cardiff.

50
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,948
Wh...
How did I get here?

51
00:08:23,016 --> 00:08:25,561
You were found in the street more
dead than alive with a head injury.

52
00:08:25,585 --> 00:08:28,349
How did you get
that skull fracture?

53
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:32,551
I... don't remember.

54
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:35,389
This is Inspector Owen.
I'm Dr. Mannering.

55
00:08:35,461 --> 00:08:37,395
What's your name?

56
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:41,333
Lawrence Talbot.

57
00:08:41,401 --> 00:08:43,562
Lawrence Talbot.

58
00:08:43,636 --> 00:08:45,570
Where did you come from?

59
00:08:47,807 --> 00:08:50,401
Llanwelly Village.

60
00:08:50,476 --> 00:08:53,775
But... how did I get
to Cardiff?

61
00:08:53,847 --> 00:08:56,680
That's enough for now.
You must rest.

62
00:08:56,749 --> 00:08:59,047
You'll be fit again very soon.

63
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:10,552
If there's any change,
call me immediately.

64
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,564
Yes, Doctor.

65
00:09:30,516 --> 00:09:34,008
Hello? Put me through to the
police station at Llanwelly.

66
00:09:34,087 --> 00:09:37,113
Just a routine checkup, Doctor.
Then we can close the case.

67
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,975
Llanwelly Police Station.

68
00:09:57,043 --> 00:10:00,706
This is Inspector Owen
speaking, from Cardiff.

69
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,214
Have you got anything in
your file on a man named...

70
00:10:04,617 --> 00:10:06,915
Lawrence Talbot?

71
00:10:06,986 --> 00:10:09,716
Why, of course.
He lived here.

72
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:12,917
Good. That's all right, then. We've
got him up here in our hospital.

73
00:10:12,992 --> 00:10:15,859
I wouldn't want him
in our hospital.

74
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:18,955
He died four years ago.

75
00:10:19,032 --> 00:10:21,057
Why, of course I'm sure,
Inspector.

76
00:10:21,134 --> 00:10:23,159
I was present at his funeral.

77
00:10:23,236 --> 00:10:25,932
That'll be all,
Inspector. Good-bye.

78
00:10:27,507 --> 00:10:31,375
Lawrence Talbot died four years ago.
Your man's an impostor.

79
00:10:31,444 --> 00:10:35,574
That's a harsh word, Inspector.
Poor devil of unsound mind.

80
00:10:35,648 --> 00:10:38,048
I'll wager he's sound enough
to remember his own name.

81
00:10:38,117 --> 00:10:40,051
I'm gonna have
another talk with him.

82
00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:42,087
Inspector.
Yeah?

83
00:10:42,155 --> 00:10:44,851
That man is my patient,
not your prisoner.

84
00:10:44,924 --> 00:10:47,085
I'll decide when
he can be questioned again.

85
00:10:48,161 --> 00:10:50,925
Very well.
It's in your hands.

86
00:13:26,452 --> 00:13:29,853
I found this bandage here
when I came in this morning.

87
00:13:29,922 --> 00:13:33,790
I didn't open the window.
The patient must've done it himself.

88
00:13:45,671 --> 00:13:47,605
You'd better cover him up.

89
00:14:01,854 --> 00:14:04,015
You're all right.
Nothing has happened.

90
00:14:09,328 --> 00:14:12,525
Better get some more bandages.
We'll renew the compress.

91
00:14:12,598 --> 00:14:15,294
Now, don't excite yourself.
Please be calm.

92
00:14:20,106 --> 00:14:23,872
Doctor... something
terrible has happened.

93
00:14:23,943 --> 00:14:27,174
You must've had a nightmare. It's
evident you were walking in your sleep.

94
00:14:29,048 --> 00:14:30,982
Call the police.

95
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:34,178
The police?
Yes, you'd better call them.

96
00:14:34,253 --> 00:14:36,380
I'm a...

97
00:14:36,455 --> 00:14:38,389
I'm a murderer.

98
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:42,386
Yes, of course.
Anything you say.

99
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:47,590
Ask Inspector Owen to come here at once.
Yes, Doctor.

100
00:14:53,606 --> 00:14:56,097
What is all this
about wanting the police?

101
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:01,268
Last night, I...
I killed someone.

102
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:05,844
But you were in
this room all night.

103
00:15:05,918 --> 00:15:09,251
I tell you, I did it.
I killed someone.

104
00:15:09,322 --> 00:15:11,313
But you couldn't have.

105
00:15:12,491 --> 00:15:14,891
You must've heard
the nurses discussing it.

106
00:15:14,961 --> 00:15:17,759
Mr. Talbot, you're suffering
from a delusion.

107
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:22,028
It's true someone was killed last night,
but it happened many streets from here.

108
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:25,093
Moreover, he was attacked
by some sort of wild animal.

109
00:15:25,171 --> 00:15:29,437
That's just it.
I turn into an animal.

110
00:15:34,547 --> 00:15:36,538
Well, Mr. Talbot.

111
00:15:36,616 --> 00:15:39,141
Decided to remember
your real name?

112
00:15:39,218 --> 00:15:42,949
Mr. Talbot seems to have heard about
the unfortunate constable last night.

113
00:15:43,022 --> 00:15:46,185
It's disturbing him. But
he doesn't understand.

114
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:48,989
There's a curse upon me.
I change into a wolf.

115
00:15:52,064 --> 00:15:54,430
It's a bit difficult
to believe, my good man.

116
00:15:57,503 --> 00:15:59,596
See that scar?

117
00:15:59,672 --> 00:16:02,266
That's where I was bitten
by a wolf.

118
00:16:02,341 --> 00:16:05,572
Only it wasn't a real wolf.
It was a man.

119
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:09,411
A werewolf.
I killed him.

120
00:16:09,482 --> 00:16:12,645
Now I change into a wolf
at night when the moon is full.

121
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:15,987
Hmph.

122
00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:18,250
It's the truth.

123
00:16:18,324 --> 00:16:21,157
Ask Maleva, the old
Gypsy woman. She knows.

124
00:16:21,227 --> 00:16:23,161
Maleva? Gypsy?
Hmph.

125
00:16:23,229 --> 00:16:25,163
Mr. Talbot, you must
get back into bed.

126
00:16:25,231 --> 00:16:29,531
Oh, are you blind? Won't
you believe me? Help me.

127
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:32,662
Just tell us your real name.
Let us do the worrying.

128
00:16:32,738 --> 00:16:35,206
I told you.
Lawrence Talbot.

129
00:16:35,274 --> 00:16:39,040
Lawrence Talbot!
Why can't you understand?

130
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:43,013
Lawrence Talbot died
four years ago.

131
00:16:45,017 --> 00:16:46,951
Died?

132
00:16:48,521 --> 00:16:51,251
Four years?

133
00:16:51,324 --> 00:16:53,258
Well, I did...

134
00:16:55,094 --> 00:16:58,689
I can't die.

135
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,058
Mr. Talbot, if you want us to
help you, you must do as we say.

136
00:17:05,137 --> 00:17:07,970
Now, please lie down.
You think I'm insane.

137
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,804
<i>You think I don't know
what I'm talking about.</i>

138
00:17:10,876 --> 00:17:14,122
Well, you just look inside that grave where
Lawrence Talbot is supposed to be buried,

139
00:17:14,146 --> 00:17:16,080
and see if you find
a body in it.

140
00:17:16,148 --> 00:17:19,777
Please get back into bed.
Get on with it.

141
00:17:19,852 --> 00:17:23,879
You're treating me like a lunatic. Well,
you're as stupid as all the rest.

142
00:17:36,602 --> 00:17:38,536
Come along, Inspector.

143
00:17:42,575 --> 00:17:46,011
You mean to say that Talbot actually
experienced that murder last night?

144
00:17:46,078 --> 00:17:48,342
I'm afraid so.

145
00:17:48,414 --> 00:17:51,781
People with brain injuries sometimes
develop supernormal mental powers...

146
00:17:51,851 --> 00:17:54,217
that are quite extraordinary.

147
00:17:54,286 --> 00:17:56,379
Certainly he got up
and opened the window.

148
00:17:56,455 --> 00:17:59,822
The borderline between delusion
and reality is very narrow.

149
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:02,793
Sometimes a patient may
unknowingly overstep that line.

150
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,724
Then that man's dangerous.
He ought to be behind bars.

151
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,330
He's a lycanthrope.

152
00:18:10,403 --> 00:18:12,735
A what?
<i>Lycanthrope.</i>

153
00:18:12,805 --> 00:18:14,898
Oh.
What's that?

154
00:18:14,974 --> 00:18:17,807
A man who imagines himself
to be a wolf.

155
00:18:17,877 --> 00:18:20,573
Oh.

156
00:18:20,646 --> 00:18:23,513
Poor devil.

157
00:18:23,582 --> 00:18:26,483
We should try to do
something to help him.

158
00:18:26,552 --> 00:18:30,545
Well, Doctor, I think I'll run
up to Llanwelly and find out...

159
00:18:30,623 --> 00:18:33,091
You know, Inspector,
I had the very same idea.

160
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:35,650
To be able to cure this man,
I have to know who he is.

161
00:18:35,728 --> 00:18:38,162
Right.
We'll go up together.

162
00:18:58,384 --> 00:19:00,477
Somebody's broken
into this vault.

163
00:19:00,553 --> 00:19:02,487
How long since you were
here last, Sergeant?

164
00:19:02,555 --> 00:19:05,854
Not for months.
Nobody's died in Llanwelly lately,

165
00:19:05,925 --> 00:19:08,120
and nobody comes here
if he doesn't have to.

166
00:19:19,872 --> 00:19:21,806
The door...

167
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:26,910
What about it?
It's broken from inside.

168
00:19:26,979 --> 00:19:28,913
Here, give me that.

169
00:19:38,991 --> 00:19:41,482
Someone must've taken
the body out of the tomb.

170
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,189
That's not Lawrence Talbot.
Not Talbot?

171
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:48,665
Do you know who this is here?
Yes. That's Freddy Jolly.

172
00:19:48,734 --> 00:19:51,032
Who's he?
Been up for vagrancy.

173
00:19:54,273 --> 00:19:56,969
What would you say
he died of, Doctor?

174
00:19:57,042 --> 00:20:00,978
Severed jugular.
This man bled to death.

175
00:20:01,046 --> 00:20:03,207
Same as the constable
in Cardiff.

176
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:06,046
Looks rather like the bite of an animal.
Aye, that animal.

177
00:20:06,118 --> 00:20:08,211
We remember it well hereabouts.

178
00:20:08,287 --> 00:20:11,154
And it must've carried away
the corpse of poor Sir Lawrence.

179
00:20:11,223 --> 00:20:13,783
What animal?
Why, didn't you know, sir?

180
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:17,022
There was a wild animal
around here a few years ago.

181
00:20:17,096 --> 00:20:21,226
It killed people. Bit through their
throats, drained their blood.

182
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,497
Did they kill it?
Sir John Talbot thought he did, sir.

183
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,801
He attacked it in the dark
one night, or so he thought.

184
00:20:27,873 --> 00:20:31,809
But it was his son he killed.
Poor Mr. Larry.

185
00:20:31,877 --> 00:20:33,970
Where is Sir John Talbot now?

186
00:20:34,046 --> 00:20:38,210
Over there, sir. Died
of grief shortly after.

187
00:20:38,284 --> 00:20:40,650
Let's get out of here.
But the body, sir.

188
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:43,051
Mustn't touch that. That's evidence.
Yes, sir.

189
00:20:43,122 --> 00:20:46,101
Sergeant, if it's convenient, I'd like
to see a photograph of Lawrence Talbot.

190
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,854
There's one up in
my office, sir.

191
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,880
Good.

192
00:20:53,232 --> 00:20:55,632
Here's Mr. Larry's
photograph, sir.

193
00:20:58,304 --> 00:21:01,740
Take a look at this face, Doctor.
Isn't that our man in Cardiff?

194
00:21:01,807 --> 00:21:05,140
Yes. There is a similarity. But I
wouldn't swear it's the same man.

195
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,701
Of course it's not the same man.

196
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,580
If it were, I'd be off me top.

197
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:14,170
I think the sergeant here better
come back to Cardiff with us...

198
00:21:14,219 --> 00:21:16,153
and see if he can positively
identify this man.

199
00:21:16,221 --> 00:21:18,533
That's the thing to do. Do you
mind if I use your telephone?

200
00:21:18,557 --> 00:21:20,645
I'd like to check up on
my patient's condition.

201
00:21:20,671 --> 00:21:22,018
Of course, Doctor. Over there.

202
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:31,068
Hello? Put me through to the Queen's
Hospital in Cardiff, please.

203
00:21:31,136 --> 00:21:34,230
I want to talk to
Dr. Gordon.

204
00:21:34,306 --> 00:21:38,470
Have you ever heard of
a Gypsy woman named Maleva?

205
00:21:38,544 --> 00:21:41,012
A Gypsy woman?
A vagrant?

206
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,310
We always register them.

207
00:21:43,382 --> 00:21:45,850
Hello, Dr. Gordon?
This is Dr. Mannering speaking.

208
00:21:45,918 --> 00:21:48,113
How's Lawrence Talbot doing?

209
00:21:48,187 --> 00:21:51,281
You know, the head-injury case
that went violent yesterday.

210
00:21:57,229 --> 00:22:00,824
Did you notify the police?

211
00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:03,697
Well, I suppose that's all
we can do at present.

212
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:06,966
I'll be back tonight, Doctor.
Good-bye.

213
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,166
What happened to Talbot?
Did he die?

214
00:22:09,241 --> 00:22:12,233
No, he tore off his straightjacket
during the night and escaped.

215
00:22:12,311 --> 00:22:14,711
Tore off his straightjacket?

216
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,146
How?
Bit right through it.

217
00:22:17,216 --> 00:22:19,616
Tore it to shreds
with his teeth.

218
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:24,055
With his teeth?

219
00:22:39,905 --> 00:22:42,430
Bruno!
Stop it!

220
00:23:02,761 --> 00:23:05,355
What do you want here?

221
00:23:05,431 --> 00:23:08,730
I'm looking for
an old Gypsy woman.

222
00:23:08,801 --> 00:23:10,894
Maleva is her name.

223
00:23:10,969 --> 00:23:13,767
Is she here with you? Maleva?
Yeah, she is with us.

224
00:23:16,508 --> 00:23:19,841
You'll find her over there.

225
00:23:26,652 --> 00:23:29,177
Maleva!

226
00:23:29,254 --> 00:23:31,347
They told me you'd left England.

227
00:23:31,423 --> 00:23:35,587
I've looked all over Europe
for you, from town to town.

228
00:23:35,661 --> 00:23:39,290
Now that I've found you,
you must help me.

229
00:23:41,433 --> 00:23:43,367
Come in.

230
00:23:59,518 --> 00:24:02,419
What do you want from me?

231
00:24:02,488 --> 00:24:04,683
Maleva,

232
00:24:04,757 --> 00:24:07,749
here I still carry
the sign of the pentagram.

233
00:24:07,826 --> 00:24:10,351
The mark of the werewolf.

234
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:13,330
I kill people.

235
00:24:13,398 --> 00:24:16,094
When the moon is full,
I turn into a wolf.

236
00:24:16,168 --> 00:24:19,160
It's not in my power
to help you.

237
00:24:19,238 --> 00:24:21,798
You're the only one
that understands.

238
00:24:21,874 --> 00:24:24,672
Nobody else in the world
will believe me.

239
00:24:29,181 --> 00:24:32,514
But you...
you know.

240
00:24:33,585 --> 00:24:36,679
Your own son Bela
was a werewolf.

241
00:24:36,755 --> 00:24:40,191
He attacked me. He changed
me into a werewolf.

242
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:43,422
<i>He's the one that put
this curse on me.</i>

243
00:24:43,495 --> 00:24:47,522
You watched over him until
he was permitted to die.

244
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:50,159
Well, now I want to die too.

245
00:24:50,235 --> 00:24:53,762
<i>Won't you show me the way?</i>
I can't.

246
00:24:59,244 --> 00:25:02,680
But I will guard you
and take care of you...

247
00:25:02,748 --> 00:25:05,046
as I took care of my own son.

248
00:25:05,117 --> 00:25:09,053
You're not leaving us.
You're not going with him.

249
00:25:09,121 --> 00:25:11,214
He has the sign
of the beast on him.

250
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:14,623
He is dangerous
only when the moon is full.

251
00:25:14,693 --> 00:25:16,684
I shall watch over him.

252
00:25:16,762 --> 00:25:19,128
He will murder you.

253
00:25:19,198 --> 00:25:23,259
No. I shall take him
to a place I know.

254
00:25:25,404 --> 00:25:28,100
Where?
I know a man...

255
00:25:28,173 --> 00:25:31,165
who has the power to help you.

256
00:25:31,243 --> 00:25:33,370
Help me?

257
00:25:33,445 --> 00:25:35,379
Who?

258
00:26:16,889 --> 00:26:18,857
Is that the town?

259
00:26:18,924 --> 00:26:21,722
Yes, that is Vasaria.

260
00:26:23,428 --> 00:26:26,920
At last.

261
00:26:42,347 --> 00:26:45,339
Stop.
Ooh.

262
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:47,908
Let's ask in here.

263
00:27:19,651 --> 00:27:22,484
Are you the proprietor?
I am.

264
00:27:22,554 --> 00:27:26,490
<i>What do you beggars want?
We just want to ask you, sir,</i>

265
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:29,493
<i>about the Doctor Frankenstein.</i>

266
00:27:29,561 --> 00:27:33,497
Frankenstein? Don't mention
that name around this town.

267
00:27:33,565 --> 00:27:36,329
Oh, please, won't you
tell us where he lives?

268
00:27:45,477 --> 00:27:47,411
There.

269
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:53,643
That's his burial place.

270
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:56,517
The fire destroyed him
and all his misdeeds.

271
00:27:56,588 --> 00:27:58,954
He's dead?
Oh, but he can't be.

272
00:27:59,024 --> 00:28:00,992
He didn't die
any too soon for us.

273
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:03,550
We all wish that
he'd never been born.

274
00:28:03,628 --> 00:28:05,721
What did you want with him?

275
00:28:05,797 --> 00:28:08,231
I heard he was a great doctor...

276
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:12,327
who could help people that
other doctors couldn't cure.

277
00:28:12,404 --> 00:28:16,340
<i>Him? Murder and crimes
was all he ever brought us.</i>

278
00:28:16,408 --> 00:28:18,740
<i>He harbored a monster
in his house,</i>

279
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:21,142
<i>a thing created by black magic.</i>

280
00:28:21,213 --> 00:28:24,705
Dr. Frankenstein, dead.

281
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:33,424
Come.

282
00:28:33,492 --> 00:28:36,552
Thank you, sir,
for the information.

283
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:42,533
Come on.
Get out and stay out.

284
00:28:42,601 --> 00:28:44,535
We don't want your kind
around here.

285
00:28:44,603 --> 00:28:47,367
Oh, keep your hands off of me!

286
00:29:07,893 --> 00:29:11,226
Now I must go on living.

287
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:14,129
There's no hope for me to die.

288
00:29:51,803 --> 00:29:55,068
Wait! Stop!
Don't go!

289
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,584
Wait!
Don't go!

290
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:15,919
Don't!

291
00:30:59,738 --> 00:31:02,036
Who could've done
this terrible thing?

292
00:31:02,107 --> 00:31:03,836
Could it be the monster again?

293
00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:05,843
Frankenstein's monster?

294
00:31:05,911 --> 00:31:09,142
No. The monster was burned
to death by Dr. Frankenstein.

295
00:31:09,214 --> 00:31:11,409
Yes, we found his bones
and buried them.

296
00:31:11,483 --> 00:31:13,610
How do you know they were
the monster's bones?

297
00:31:13,685 --> 00:31:17,143
She wasn't killed by a monster.
An animal bit her to death.

298
00:31:17,222 --> 00:31:19,486
I saw the wound on her throat.

299
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:23,153
What animals are around
here that can kill people?

300
00:31:30,101 --> 00:31:32,899
A wolf.
Yes, a wolf.

301
00:31:32,971 --> 00:31:36,407
That's his cry. Come on.
Let's get him.

302
00:31:49,888 --> 00:31:52,220
Come on!
Come on!

303
00:32:28,526 --> 00:32:30,790
There he is!

304
00:32:52,751 --> 00:32:55,982
Where is he?
He was here a moment ago.

305
00:33:37,228 --> 00:33:39,890
The Gypsy woman! What
are you doing here?

306
00:33:39,964 --> 00:33:41,898
Come on.
Speak up, old witch.

307
00:33:41,966 --> 00:33:44,230
Where's that strange man
that was with you?

308
00:33:44,302 --> 00:33:47,396
Let's take her back to town.
We'll make her speak.

309
00:37:01,132 --> 00:37:04,431
Dr. Frankenstein
must've kept records.

310
00:37:04,502 --> 00:37:06,834
A diary.

311
00:37:06,905 --> 00:37:09,772
You know where it is.
Show me.

312
00:38:34,926 --> 00:38:36,860
It isn't here.

313
00:38:51,743 --> 00:38:54,940
"To my dear father."

314
00:38:55,013 --> 00:38:58,141
Then...
she's the one...

315
00:38:58,216 --> 00:39:00,184
that can tell me.

316
00:39:01,753 --> 00:39:05,553
And this man, he wishes to buy
the ruins of my father's estate?

317
00:39:05,623 --> 00:39:08,683
<i>Yes. That's why I asked you
to come here, Baroness.</i>

318
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,820
He wanted me to give him
your address.

319
00:39:11,896 --> 00:39:14,330
Naturally, I refused.

320
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:17,232
But since I knew you were anxious
to get rid of the property,

321
00:39:17,301 --> 00:39:19,895
and all the memories
connected with it,

322
00:39:19,971 --> 00:39:23,134
I thought that in
my position as mayor...

323
00:39:23,207 --> 00:39:26,040
I would take the liberty
of sending for you.

324
00:39:28,046 --> 00:39:30,844
- Did he say his name is Taylor?
- Yes.

325
00:39:30,915 --> 00:39:32,940
And that's all I know about him.

326
00:39:36,487 --> 00:39:39,183
Baroness Frankenstein,
Mr. Taylor.

327
00:39:40,391 --> 00:39:43,360
- Baroness.
- Mr. Taylor.

328
00:39:43,428 --> 00:39:47,228
<i>Come in, Mr. Taylor.
Come in, come in.</i>

329
00:39:47,298 --> 00:39:50,062
Do you mind if I speak to
the baroness alone, please?

330
00:39:50,134 --> 00:39:54,662
Why... Why,
certainly, certainly.

331
00:39:56,841 --> 00:39:59,503
Now, if...

332
00:39:59,577 --> 00:40:03,638
If you need a witness for the contract,
Baroness, I'm at your service.

333
00:40:03,715 --> 00:40:05,649
Thank you.

334
00:40:11,355 --> 00:40:14,347
Won't you please
sit down, Mr. Taylor?

335
00:40:14,425 --> 00:40:16,359
Thank you.

336
00:40:19,864 --> 00:40:22,025
I understand that
you want to buy our land.

337
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:25,536
No, I...
I wanted to meet you.

338
00:40:28,206 --> 00:40:30,936
I don't understand.
<i>I didn't know how to find you,</i>

339
00:40:31,008 --> 00:40:33,602
and the mayor wouldn't
give me your address,

340
00:40:33,678 --> 00:40:36,977
so I felt that if I offered
to buy your land...

341
00:40:37,048 --> 00:40:39,243
that you'd be sure to come.

342
00:40:39,317 --> 00:40:43,481
It's certainly a most unusual
way to make an acquaintance.

343
00:40:43,554 --> 00:40:46,182
But now that you have gone to
all this trouble to meet me,

344
00:40:46,257 --> 00:40:48,623
what can I really do for you?

345
00:40:50,962 --> 00:40:52,759
I want your father's records.

346
00:40:54,165 --> 00:40:57,464
<i>His experiments
with life and death.</i>

347
00:40:57,535 --> 00:41:00,265
<i>The records of the creation
of the monster.</i>

348
00:41:06,544 --> 00:41:08,603
My father's diary.

349
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:11,341
Yes. You must
give it to me.

350
00:41:11,415 --> 00:41:13,406
I don't have any records.

351
00:41:13,484 --> 00:41:15,418
If I had, I...

352
00:41:15,486 --> 00:41:18,478
I would have destroyed
them long ago.

353
00:41:18,556 --> 00:41:21,719
My father was a great scientist,

354
00:41:21,793 --> 00:41:25,126
but all he created
brought unhappiness,

355
00:41:26,397 --> 00:41:28,331
terror.

356
00:41:31,836 --> 00:41:34,828
Oh, but you don't understand.

357
00:41:34,906 --> 00:41:38,239
I must have them.
Won't you help me?

358
00:41:39,677 --> 00:41:43,670
I'm sorry, Mr. Taylor.
There is nothing I can do.

359
00:41:43,748 --> 00:41:46,046
The house burned down,

360
00:41:46,117 --> 00:41:48,347
and I have never set a foot
on that ground again...

361
00:41:48,419 --> 00:41:50,751
and never shall.

362
00:41:50,822 --> 00:41:53,290
And that's all the
information I can give you.

363
00:41:53,357 --> 00:41:56,918
Well, is everything
settled, Baroness?

364
00:41:56,994 --> 00:41:59,121
No.

365
00:41:59,197 --> 00:42:01,927
We decided not to go through
with the sale after all.

366
00:42:05,736 --> 00:42:08,899
Why, that sounds like...
Yes, Baroness.

367
00:42:08,973 --> 00:42:12,602
It's the Festival of New Wine.
It begins tonight.

368
00:42:12,677 --> 00:42:15,703
It's beautiful.

369
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,408
Takes me back to my childhood.

370
00:42:38,703 --> 00:42:42,537
Why don't you join us tonight,
Baroness, as our guest of honor?

371
00:42:42,607 --> 00:42:45,804
You would take the first
train in the morning.

372
00:42:45,877 --> 00:42:49,005
Thank you, Mayor.
Of course I'll stay.

373
00:42:57,755 --> 00:43:01,020
You, too, Mr. Taylor. I hope you
will accept the invitation...

374
00:43:01,092 --> 00:43:04,892
to be our guest tonight,
on behalf of our community.

375
00:43:04,962 --> 00:43:08,762
Thank you.
I'll be there.

376
00:45:47,425 --> 00:45:50,326
Eternally!
I don't want to live eternally!

377
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:55,863
Stay away!
Go away, all of you!

378
00:45:55,933 --> 00:45:58,163
<i>Let me alone.!</i>

379
00:45:58,235 --> 00:46:02,296
Stay away!

380
00:46:13,417 --> 00:46:15,578
Good evening,
Mr. Talbot.

381
00:46:15,653 --> 00:46:17,587
I beg your pardon.

382
00:46:17,655 --> 00:46:21,091
You must be mistaken. My name is Taylor.
I know you by Talbot.

383
00:46:21,158 --> 00:46:24,992
Lawrence Talbot. You carry your
identification on your forehead.

384
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:39,903
Baroness Frankenstein,
Dr. Mannering.

385
00:46:39,977 --> 00:46:41,945
How do you do,
Dr. Mannering?

386
00:46:42,012 --> 00:46:44,378
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.

387
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:50,680
How does it happen
that you're here, Doctor?

388
00:46:50,754 --> 00:46:52,722
I've been looking
for you, Mr. Talbot.

389
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:55,224
And you were very easy to find.

390
00:46:55,292 --> 00:46:57,852
The newspapers told me
where to look for you.

391
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:03,591
Fontainbleu, Aachen,

392
00:47:03,667 --> 00:47:05,601
Elrad,

393
00:47:05,669 --> 00:47:07,899
and finally Vasaria.

394
00:47:07,972 --> 00:47:11,237
I simply followed the trail
and found you.

395
00:47:11,308 --> 00:47:13,640
Very clever of you,
wasn't it, Doctor?

396
00:47:13,711 --> 00:47:16,874
Mr. Talbot is returning
to England with me.

397
00:47:16,947 --> 00:47:19,780
I don't think that I care
to do that, Doctor.

398
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:22,614
Baroness, will you give me
the honor of the next dance?

399
00:47:22,686 --> 00:47:24,620
Of course.

400
00:47:24,688 --> 00:47:26,656
At our Festival
of New Wine, gentlemen,

401
00:47:26,724 --> 00:47:28,724
it's a man's privilege
to ask any lady for a dance.

402
00:47:28,726 --> 00:47:31,217
And vice-versa.
Excuse us.

403
00:47:37,701 --> 00:47:40,101
Why have you followed me?

404
00:47:40,171 --> 00:47:42,696
Talbot, you're a murderer.

405
00:47:42,773 --> 00:47:45,867
Prove it.
You're insane at times, and you know it.

406
00:47:45,906 --> 00:47:48,187
You're sane enough now, though,
to know what you're doing.

407
00:47:48,212 --> 00:47:50,180
Why don't you let me
take care of you?

408
00:47:50,247 --> 00:47:52,659
Do you think it would do any good
to put me in a lunatic asylum?

409
00:47:52,683 --> 00:47:55,083
You know that's where you belong.
It's the only thing to do.

410
00:47:55,152 --> 00:47:58,610
That wouldn't do any good. I'd only
escape again, sooner or later.

411
00:47:58,689 --> 00:48:00,816
We might be able to cure you.
Might prevent you...

412
00:48:00,891 --> 00:48:04,327
I only want to die.
That's why I'm here.

413
00:48:04,395 --> 00:48:07,296
If I ever find peace,
I'll find it here.

414
00:48:07,364 --> 00:48:10,595
You understand.
Why don't you help me?

415
00:48:10,668 --> 00:48:12,602
Sit down.

416
00:48:16,006 --> 00:48:18,702
How can I help you?

417
00:48:18,776 --> 00:48:21,574
Dr. Frankenstein
left a diary.

418
00:48:21,645 --> 00:48:25,012
In it are his records of the
secrets of life and death.

419
00:48:28,986 --> 00:48:31,648
<i>If I can find
Dr. Frankenstein's diary,</i>

420
00:48:31,722 --> 00:48:34,282
<i>I can break this curse
and find peace in death.</i>

421
00:48:34,358 --> 00:48:37,225
<i>That's morbid.
Besides,</i>

422
00:48:37,294 --> 00:48:40,661
Dr. Frankenstein's experiments were
considered rather extraordinary.

423
00:48:40,731 --> 00:48:43,097
Medical science never,
never recognized them.

424
00:48:43,167 --> 00:48:46,659
That's just it. Why don't you
ask that girl, his daughter?

425
00:48:46,737 --> 00:48:49,297
She can tell you about
things Dr. Frankenstein did...

426
00:48:49,373 --> 00:48:51,603
that your medical science
has never heard of.

427
00:48:51,675 --> 00:48:54,644
Talbot, I'm appealing
to your better nature...

428
00:48:54,712 --> 00:48:56,942
while you can still
think normally.

429
00:48:57,014 --> 00:49:01,417
The moon will be full again soon. You must
come back with me while there's still time.

430
00:49:01,485 --> 00:49:05,512
Isn't there somebody
that could understand?

431
00:49:21,472 --> 00:49:24,134
Gentlemen, why those
serious faces?

432
00:49:27,278 --> 00:49:31,977
<i>The monster.! The monster.!
The monster.!</i>

433
00:50:13,891 --> 00:50:16,553
No. No, it's me.

434
00:50:16,627 --> 00:50:18,618
Come on with me.

435
00:51:07,177 --> 00:51:10,078
Well?

436
00:51:10,147 --> 00:51:13,548
Not a sign of them.
We shall have to wait until morning.

437
00:51:13,617 --> 00:51:15,744
It's clear to me
they're hiding in those ruins.

438
00:51:15,819 --> 00:51:18,686
Much as I'd like to kill the
monster, I'd hate to crawl around...

439
00:51:18,756 --> 00:51:22,556
through the dark catacombs of Frankenstein's
castle in the black of the night.

440
00:51:22,626 --> 00:51:25,686
What about that Frankenstein girl?
She has lived up there.

441
00:51:28,198 --> 00:51:30,826
Let's bring her in here.
Stop, stop.

442
00:51:32,236 --> 00:51:34,727
There's no need for us all
to storm after her.

443
00:51:34,805 --> 00:51:36,739
She'll come in if I ask her.

444
00:51:36,807 --> 00:51:39,105
Why should we treat her so fancy?
She's a Frankenstein.

445
00:51:39,176 --> 00:51:42,077
Wait, wait, wait.

446
00:51:42,146 --> 00:51:44,614
She's a young woman
who's done us no harm.

447
00:51:44,681 --> 00:51:46,615
Now, stay here.

448
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:05,368
The men would like to
talk to you, Baroness.

449
00:52:14,778 --> 00:52:17,178
The Gypsy woman is still
locked up in the prison.

450
00:52:17,247 --> 00:52:19,147
Let's find out what she
knows about all of this.

451
00:52:25,722 --> 00:52:29,283
There's the daughter of
the accursed Frankenstein.

452
00:52:30,872 --> 00:52:33,672
That name has brought nothing but
misery and misfortune to our village.

453
00:52:33,697 --> 00:52:36,495
We want an end of it,
do you hear? Tonight.

454
00:52:38,202 --> 00:52:40,261
Now listen to me.

455
00:52:40,337 --> 00:52:42,182
The baroness and I want
nothing but to help you.

456
00:52:42,206 --> 00:52:44,265
I tell you, he's lying.
I heard him this evening...

457
00:52:44,341 --> 00:52:46,673
<i>talking to that stranger
about insanity and murder.</i>

458
00:52:46,743 --> 00:52:47,971
I heard it with my own ears.

459
00:52:47,997 --> 00:52:50,363
Don't get excited. You won't
get anywhere by raving.

460
00:52:50,414 --> 00:52:54,214
Dr. Mannering is right. To find and
destroy the monster, we must have a plan.

461
00:52:54,284 --> 00:52:56,718
We know that it's hiding
in the Frankenstein ruins.

462
00:52:56,787 --> 00:53:00,223
I can lead you there,
if you want me to.

463
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:02,190
I know those cellars well.

464
00:53:02,259 --> 00:53:05,558
Don't trust her! Don't let them fool you!
They're all in this together!

465
00:53:07,631 --> 00:53:09,929
Here she is.
And the Gypsy too.

466
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,197
She's one of your gang of murderers.
You know these people?

467
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:15,363
Speak up, old witch.

468
00:53:15,439 --> 00:53:17,373
I never saw them before.

469
00:53:19,142 --> 00:53:21,076
What's your name?

470
00:53:21,144 --> 00:53:24,443
Maleva.
Maleva?

471
00:53:24,515 --> 00:53:28,747
See? He knows her. Why don't
you arrest them, all of them?

472
00:53:28,819 --> 00:53:32,846
Lock up these murderers. As long as I'm
mayor, justice shall be preserved.

473
00:53:32,923 --> 00:53:34,883
I shall decide what is to
be done in this village.

474
00:53:34,925 --> 00:53:38,452
Haven't we tried before to get
rid of the monster by force?

475
00:53:38,529 --> 00:53:40,463
We burned down the sanitarium,

476
00:53:40,531 --> 00:53:44,228
and yet we didn't destroy
Frankenstein's fiendish creation.

477
00:53:44,301 --> 00:53:46,269
We must be
more clever this time.

478
00:53:46,336 --> 00:53:48,361
Let's use our brains for once.

479
00:53:48,438 --> 00:53:51,965
Whose brains? Yours? I'd
rather depend on my fists.

480
00:53:52,042 --> 00:53:54,101
There's no use
in storming the ruins.

481
00:53:54,177 --> 00:53:56,111
We must pretend to be
friends with the monster.

482
00:53:56,179 --> 00:53:59,046
Yes. Why not elect it
mayor of Vasaria?

483
00:54:00,617 --> 00:54:02,778
This monster was created
artificially.

484
00:54:02,853 --> 00:54:05,822
It must be destroyed
by the same means.

485
00:54:05,889 --> 00:54:09,689
I'll take you to the ruins now.
I'll go with you, of course.

486
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:14,060
I promise you, if you'll help me, I'll rid
Vasaria of this curse once and for all.

487
00:54:20,571 --> 00:54:24,200
Talbot!
Talbot!

488
00:54:25,776 --> 00:54:28,438
Talbot, where are you?

489
00:54:32,349 --> 00:54:35,375
Talbot, we're your friends.

490
00:54:35,452 --> 00:54:38,649
They must be there.
I saw the smoke.

491
00:54:40,324 --> 00:54:43,225
- What do you want?
- We have come to help you.

492
00:54:44,294 --> 00:54:46,228
What do you mean?

493
00:54:46,296 --> 00:54:48,389
You wanted to find
my father's diary.

494
00:54:48,465 --> 00:54:51,730
Yes, of course.
<i>I'll show you where it is hidden.</i>

495
00:54:54,071 --> 00:54:56,938
She speaks the truth, my son.

496
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:03,175
I... I guess
I'll have to trust you.

497
00:55:40,984 --> 00:55:42,918
Steady.

498
00:55:44,588 --> 00:55:47,250
They're friends.

499
00:56:08,679 --> 00:56:10,772
This is Dr. Mannering.

500
00:56:10,847 --> 00:56:12,974
He's come to help you,
to make you well.

501
00:56:14,117 --> 00:56:17,484
<i>Yes, that's why I'm here.</i>

502
00:56:36,773 --> 00:56:38,707
Dr. Mannering.

503
00:56:40,944 --> 00:56:43,936
But the diary... You said you
knew where your father hid it.

504
00:56:45,415 --> 00:56:47,349
Yes.

505
00:56:52,656 --> 00:56:54,624
It isn't in there.
I know.

506
00:56:54,691 --> 00:56:56,625
Please.

507
00:57:15,879 --> 00:57:18,347
<i>The Secret of Life and Death.</i>

508
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:26,355
"Matter ages because
it loses energy."

509
00:57:26,423 --> 00:57:28,482
"This artificial body
I have created..."

510
00:57:28,558 --> 00:57:31,322
"has been charged with
superhuman power..."

511
00:57:31,394 --> 00:57:34,989
"so that its span of life
will be extended."

512
00:57:35,065 --> 00:57:39,695
"Its lifetime will equal the lives of
more than a hundred human beings."

513
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:43,069
"This, my creation,
can never perish, unless..."

514
00:57:47,978 --> 00:57:50,947
"unless its energies are
drained off artificially...

515
00:57:51,014 --> 00:57:54,177
by changing the poles
from plus to minus."

516
00:57:54,251 --> 00:57:57,982
But that's the secret of life.
What good does it do me?

517
00:57:58,054 --> 00:58:00,989
I'm not interested in life.

518
00:58:01,057 --> 00:58:03,457
I wasn't created artificially.

519
00:58:03,527 --> 00:58:06,655
I'm a human being. I've got
real blood in my veins.

520
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:08,994
What can we do to end my life?

521
00:58:13,403 --> 00:58:16,804
"Energy which cannot be
destroyed can be transmitted."

522
00:58:18,942 --> 00:58:20,876
Well, if that's the case,

523
00:58:20,944 --> 00:58:23,674
then the energies from my
body can be drained off also.

524
00:58:26,049 --> 00:58:28,745
Dr. Frankenstein must've...

525
00:58:28,819 --> 00:58:31,413
performed his experiments
in this room.

526
00:58:34,224 --> 00:58:36,215
With these machines.

527
00:58:42,032 --> 00:58:45,229
The don't seem to have been
destroyed by the fire.

528
00:58:45,302 --> 00:58:47,236
You must fix them...

529
00:58:47,304 --> 00:58:50,933
<i>and help me be rid of this thing
that keeps me alive eternally.</i>

530
00:58:57,514 --> 00:59:00,745
When you were talking
to the monster,

531
00:59:00,817 --> 00:59:03,217
I was afraid you meant
what you said.

532
00:59:03,286 --> 00:59:06,016
What did I say?

533
00:59:06,089 --> 00:59:08,250
You said you'd help him.

534
00:59:11,494 --> 00:59:13,724
Of course I can't.

535
00:59:13,797 --> 00:59:16,561
I mustn't.

536
00:59:32,215 --> 00:59:35,446
It shouldn't be difficult
to connect these wires again.

537
00:59:39,923 --> 00:59:43,359
Yes, I'll need these machines.

538
00:59:43,426 --> 00:59:46,054
I believe they can be
repaired again.

539
01:00:04,881 --> 01:00:07,111
<i>Machines, day after day.!</i>

540
01:00:07,183 --> 01:00:09,515
What does Mannering
need machines for?

541
01:00:09,586 --> 01:00:13,215
Remember Dr. Frankenstein?
He ordered machines too.

542
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:16,589
I tell you, that English doctor's no
better than Frankenstein himself.

543
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:21,529
Ho, hum. Always grumbling, Vazek.
Always complaining.

544
01:00:21,598 --> 01:00:24,294
We've got to trust the doctor.
What else can we do?

545
01:00:24,367 --> 01:00:28,133
But doesn't it strike you as strange that
Mannering and that Frankenstein girl...

546
01:00:28,204 --> 01:00:30,229
never tell us what
they're doing up there?

547
01:00:30,307 --> 01:00:32,298
If it wasn't for
that old Gypsy witch...

548
01:00:32,375 --> 01:00:35,742
driving her wagon down to buy their
provisions, we'd never see any of them.

549
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:41,280
- I think we ought to go up there and see for ourselves.
- <i>Right.</i>

550
01:00:41,351 --> 01:00:45,185
<i>Oh, they're not hurting us.
It's none of our affair what goes on there.</i>

551
01:00:45,255 --> 01:00:47,723
<i>Do you want to wait for disaster
to strike at us again?</i>

552
01:00:47,791 --> 01:00:50,385
I'll tell you what
we ought to do.

553
01:00:52,696 --> 01:00:55,324
Here are the ruins.

554
01:00:55,398 --> 01:00:58,333
In here are all of them.

555
01:00:58,401 --> 01:01:00,761
Here runs the underground
stream that drives

556
01:01:00,787 --> 01:01:02,988
the turbines that
Frankenstein installed.

557
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:06,531
But the water comes
from up here...

558
01:01:06,609 --> 01:01:08,543
to the dam below.

559
01:01:09,846 --> 01:01:12,041
Blow up that dam and they'll
all drown like rats.

560
01:01:12,115 --> 01:01:14,049
<i>All of them.</i>

561
01:01:18,855 --> 01:01:21,050
You're drunk, Vazek.

562
01:01:21,124 --> 01:01:23,820
That's why I don't take
your word seriously.

563
01:01:23,893 --> 01:01:26,760
Otherwise, I'd have you arrested
for conspiring to endanger...

564
01:01:26,830 --> 01:01:28,923
the lives of this community.

565
01:02:14,444 --> 01:02:16,708
That's the water.

566
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:20,045
The water rushing down
to turn the turbines.

567
01:02:20,116 --> 01:02:22,584
That'll make the machines work.

568
01:02:33,563 --> 01:02:36,589
<i>Doctor.!
Aren't you almost ready?</i>

569
01:02:36,666 --> 01:02:40,193
I'm setting the machines now. Everything
will be ready for you in a little while.

570
01:02:40,270 --> 01:02:42,204
Yes, but there's so little time.

571
01:02:42,272 --> 01:02:44,638
I don't want to live
through another spell.

572
01:02:44,707 --> 01:02:46,723
<i>Yes, I know. But please
don't bother me now.</i>

573
01:02:46,749 --> 01:02:47,599
<i>I have work to do.</i>

574
01:02:47,644 --> 01:02:51,512
Remember, Doctor.
It must be tonight.

575
01:03:01,524 --> 01:03:03,617
Why don't you lock him up...

576
01:03:03,693 --> 01:03:07,060
so you can give your full attention
to do what you promised...

577
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:09,428
to destroy the danger
of the monster?

578
01:03:09,499 --> 01:03:12,059
Please, Elsa, I know
what I have to do.

579
01:03:12,135 --> 01:03:15,127
- But he's insane!
<i>- Insane?</i>

580
01:03:15,205 --> 01:03:17,765
He's not insane.

581
01:03:17,841 --> 01:03:19,968
He simply wants to die.

582
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:52,638
Frank! Frank!

583
01:04:01,117 --> 01:04:03,449
Listen to me, Frank.

584
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:06,387
I saw my father become
obsessed by his power.

585
01:04:06,456 --> 01:04:08,424
He died a horrible death,

586
01:04:08,491 --> 01:04:10,755
just as my grandfather did.
Yes, I know.

587
01:04:10,827 --> 01:04:15,662
You promised the people to rid
Vasaria of this monstrous creation.

588
01:04:15,732 --> 01:04:17,825
I want to be sure that nothing,

589
01:04:17,901 --> 01:04:19,835
nothing whatsoever,
can sway you.

590
01:04:19,903 --> 01:04:24,772
It is in your hands to undo the crimes
my father and grandfather committed.

591
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:29,340
We must clear the name
of Frankenstein.

592
01:04:29,412 --> 01:04:32,973
All right. Tonight, I will
draw off the monster's energy.

593
01:04:34,217 --> 01:04:36,651
And I hope I'll bring
peace to both of them.

594
01:05:15,325 --> 01:05:17,589
"Connecting the plus poles
to the minus...

595
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:21,221
"will charge the energy output
of the nervous system...

596
01:05:21,297 --> 01:05:24,460
as by connecting
the minus to the minus."

597
01:05:27,737 --> 01:05:30,262
Connect the minus to the minus.

598
01:05:36,512 --> 01:05:38,537
I can't do it.

599
01:05:39,849 --> 01:05:43,250
I can't destroy
Frankenstein's creation.

600
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:47,014
I've got to see it
at its full power.

601
01:08:33,923 --> 01:08:38,019
Frank! You're making
him strong again!

602
01:08:47,336 --> 01:08:49,896
Frank, stop it!

603
01:08:49,972 --> 01:08:52,668
Stop the machine, Frank!
Don't pull that switch!

604
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:18,861
Where's Vazek?
He said he'd blow up the dam.
