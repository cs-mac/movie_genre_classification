Now it's time for my story.

30
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,460
My story deals with a man who

31
00:03:52,752 --> 00:03:54,392
used to live in that
old dilapidated house

32
00:03:54,546 --> 00:03:56,173
behind those trees.

33
00:03:57,007 --> 00:03:58,608
We're not supposed to
be this close to it

34
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,470
because many strange things

35
00:04:02,762 --> 00:04:04,389
happen around here.

36
00:04:06,183 --> 00:04:08,226
He was a farmer with his family,

37
00:04:08,518 --> 00:04:10,020
wife and two children.

38
00:04:10,312 --> 00:04:12,314
He was an evil man.

39
00:04:14,357 --> 00:04:16,067
Ugly and mean.

40
00:04:16,568 --> 00:04:17,861
He'd beat his wife.

41
00:04:20,071 --> 00:04:21,698
Brutally punish his children.

42
00:04:22,115 --> 00:04:23,700
He'd drink at the tavern and...

43
00:04:25,493 --> 00:04:26,953
Fight all the time.

44
00:04:27,245 --> 00:04:28,485
He once had a piece of his nose

45
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,917
bitten off in a brawl
and didn't feel a thing.

46
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:34,711
It was a night like tonight.

47
00:04:35,837 --> 00:04:37,881
Many many years ago.

48
00:04:39,466 --> 00:04:41,551
Wait a minute, now
that I think about it,

49
00:04:41,843 --> 00:04:43,595
it was the same
night as tonight.

50
00:04:44,387 --> 00:04:47,682
The woods, quiet and dark.

51
00:04:48,058 --> 00:04:50,644
The farmer, for no
apparent reason,

52
00:04:50,936 --> 00:04:53,980
went stark raving mad.

53
00:04:57,484 --> 00:04:58,735
He walked into his bedroom

54
00:04:59,027 --> 00:05:00,695
with an axe in his hand and

55
00:05:00,987 --> 00:05:04,950
chopped his sleeping
wife into little pieces.

56
00:05:05,325 --> 00:05:08,662
Then with his
bloodlust awakened,

57
00:05:08,954 --> 00:05:11,456
he walked down the
hall to his son's room

58
00:05:11,748 --> 00:05:12,669
and took an axe to him,

59
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,251
but he still wasn't finished.

60
00:05:15,001 --> 00:05:18,380
He walked across the hall
to his daughter's room.

61
00:05:18,672 --> 00:05:20,882
And without so much as a word,

62
00:05:21,174 --> 00:05:23,093
he chopped her into
little pieces too.

63
00:05:23,385 --> 00:05:26,304
Then he calmly walked
into the tavern,

64
00:05:26,596 --> 00:05:29,140
lifted the bloody
axe onto the bar,

65
00:05:30,642 --> 00:05:32,227
and ordered himself a beer.

66
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,645
Well it wasn't long before

67
00:05:33,937 --> 00:05:35,217
the town found
out what happened,

68
00:05:35,438 --> 00:05:37,148
and when it did, it was all over

69
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,818
for the mad farmer,
or so they thought.

70
00:05:40,193 --> 00:05:43,113
Ten men jumped him and dragged

71
00:05:43,405 --> 00:05:44,726
him screaming to
the nearest tree,

72
00:05:44,948 --> 00:05:46,283
where they quickly
looped a thick

73
00:05:46,574 --> 00:05:48,118
rope around his neck and hoisted

74
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,911
him high into the air.

75
00:05:50,203 --> 00:05:51,037
One of them grabbed
the bloody axe

76
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:53,248
and swung it at the
farmer's head leaving

77
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,293
a deep, bloody gash at
the side of his face.

78
00:05:57,168 --> 00:06:00,714
They left him there
hanging for dead.

79
00:06:01,047 --> 00:06:02,090
Next morning, when they

80
00:06:02,382 --> 00:06:04,301
went to cut him
down, he was gone.

81
00:06:04,843 --> 00:06:06,428
It was then they noticed the

82
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,847
bodies of his wife and
children were missing.

83
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:13,101
And their bodies have
never been found.

84
00:06:13,393 --> 00:06:14,686
Oh Max, come on, how could

85
00:06:14,978 --> 00:06:16,896
their bodies never be found?!

86
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,311
I mean where could they be?

87
00:06:18,523 --> 00:06:19,566
I don't know, Richie.

88
00:06:20,317 --> 00:06:22,986
All I do know is that
on certain nights,

89
00:06:23,278 --> 00:06:24,821
when the moon is full, he's out

90
00:06:25,113 --> 00:06:27,115
there stalking in the woods.

91
00:06:27,866 --> 00:06:29,451
Searching for people so he

92
00:06:29,743 --> 00:06:32,787
can chop their heads
off with an axe.

93
00:06:33,955 --> 00:06:35,915
Or hang them from a tree.

94
00:06:36,207 --> 00:06:37,607
You trying to be
funny or something?

95
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:39,127
What's this farmer's
name anyway?

96
00:06:40,045 --> 00:06:41,245
Richie, I have a good reason

97
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:42,630
I haven't told you his name.

98
00:06:43,298 --> 00:06:44,257
A very good reason.

99
00:06:44,924 --> 00:06:47,802
You see, it is said also that

100
00:06:48,094 --> 00:06:52,640
if you say his name above
a whisper in the woods,

101
00:06:52,932 --> 00:06:55,060
he will hear you because he can

102
00:06:55,352 --> 00:06:58,355
be anywhere anytime.

103
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:01,524
And if he hears
you call his name,

104
00:07:02,776 --> 00:07:03,902
he'll come for you.

105
00:07:04,527 --> 00:07:07,697
And if he comes for
you, he'll get you.

106
00:07:08,823 --> 00:07:11,576
One by one, you'll start

107
00:07:11,868 --> 00:07:15,080
to fall before night's over.

108
00:07:16,748 --> 00:07:18,458
"Ru get you all."

109
00:07:20,502 --> 00:07:25,382
His name is Madman Marz.

110
00:07:27,425 --> 00:07:29,177
What'd he
say, I couldn't hear him.

111
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:31,805
His name is Marz.

112
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,141
Madman Marz.

113
00:07:36,935 --> 00:07:39,938
Hey Marz, Madman Marz,

114
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,732
here we are, come
and get us, Madman!

115
00:07:46,778 --> 00:07:49,406
Madman Marz!

116
00:07:49,697 --> 00:07:51,658
Oh Richie, now you've done it!

117
00:07:52,325 --> 00:07:53,118
Don't you realize you're fooling

118
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,786
with things beyond
your control?!

119
00:07:55,662 --> 00:07:56,583
The Madman Marz doesn't

120
00:07:56,621 --> 00:07:57,914
understand anymore!

121
00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:01,126
Madman Marz thinks
you're making fun of him.

122
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,545
He didn't mean it, Marz!

123
00:08:03,878 --> 00:08:05,255
He's young and foolish and

124
00:08:05,547 --> 00:08:07,006
doesn't know what he's doing!

125
00:08:07,298 --> 00:08:09,134
Stay where you are,
we mean you no harm!

126
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:12,262
Let's hope that
stopped him in time.

127
00:08:13,054 --> 00:08:16,307
If not, no one is safe
in the woods tonight.

128
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:18,643
Anyone alone in the woods.

129
00:08:18,935 --> 00:08:21,771
You can't hear him,
you can't see him.

130
00:08:22,605 --> 00:08:25,442
You smell his odor of death,

131
00:08:26,317 --> 00:08:29,195
and you turn
around, and suddenly

132
00:08:29,487 --> 00:08:34,284
this horribly mutilated
face stares down at you.

133
00:08:35,285 --> 00:08:39,581
It's the last thing
you see before zap!

134
00:08:40,123 --> 00:08:41,374
Off goes your head.

135
00:08:44,502 --> 00:08:47,088
I hope you enjoyed
my little story.

136
00:08:48,631 --> 00:08:51,050
It's my way of saying goodbye

137
00:08:51,342 --> 00:08:53,386
and good luck to you children.

138
00:08:56,222 --> 00:08:58,349
Tomorrow, your
parents will be up

139
00:08:58,641 --> 00:09:02,228
to spend the last weekend
before Thanksgiving,

140
00:09:02,896 --> 00:09:06,649
and my winter
vacation down South.

141
00:09:09,527 --> 00:09:11,029
I enjoyed your company-

142
00:09:11,946 --> 00:09:14,240
Okay, when we break,
TP and the boys

143
00:09:14,908 --> 00:09:16,828
will have the responsibility
of killing the fire.

144
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,245
Everybody else will get
ready for the walk back

145
00:09:19,537 --> 00:09:24,334
and remember, don't walk in
the woods alone 'cause...

146
00:09:25,293 --> 00:09:28,296
The Madman Marz will get you!

147
00:09:28,588 --> 00:09:29,714
That's right.

148
00:09:36,554 --> 00:09:38,389
Betsy, what's a Madman Marz?

149
00:09:38,681 --> 00:09:40,321
It's nothing, honey,
it's just a figment

150
00:09:40,433 --> 00:09:42,477
of Max's imagination, something

151
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:44,437
he made up to scare
you, that's all.

152
00:09:45,104 --> 00:09:46,384
Oh, he sure did that all right,

153
00:09:46,648 --> 00:09:49,108
I was so scared I
couldn't open my eyes.

154
00:09:49,609 --> 00:09:50,985
And it's all right,
nobody's gonna

155
00:09:51,277 --> 00:09:53,071
come and get me and
chop off my head?

156
00:09:53,446 --> 00:09:54,646
Don't worry, honey, nobody's

157
00:09:54,822 --> 00:09:56,582
gonna hurt you, I'll
make sure of that, okay?

158
00:09:56,908 --> 00:09:58,029
Now you join the other girls

159
00:09:58,201 --> 00:09:59,661
and don't worry
about a thing, huh?

160
00:10:09,921 --> 00:10:11,464
Tonight, same time?

161
00:10:12,173 --> 00:10:14,008
Well if it isn't
the big brave man

162
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,219
who scares little
girls to tears.

163
00:10:16,553 --> 00:10:17,679
Proud of yourself?

164
00:10:18,846 --> 00:10:19,806
What's the matter?

165
00:10:20,098 --> 00:10:21,219
You scared half those kids

166
00:10:21,391 --> 00:10:22,433
to death, that's
what's the matter.

167
00:10:22,725 --> 00:10:24,852
Come on, Betsy, it's all
in fun, they enjoyed it.

168
00:10:25,186 --> 00:10:26,229
Now what about tonight?

169
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:27,647
Same time?

170
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:30,650
No, TP, I don't think
so, not tonight, okay?

171
00:10:31,109 --> 00:10:32,389
We don't have many nights left.

172
00:10:32,652 --> 00:10:34,612
Yes we do, we
have the rest of our lives.

173
00:10:34,904 --> 00:10:35,530
Come on, Betsy, you know you're

174
00:10:35,822 --> 00:10:36,322
not gonna wanna see me once

175
00:10:36,614 --> 00:10:37,574
we get back to the city.

176
00:10:37,657 --> 00:10:38,778
I'm sorry, TP let's just say

177
00:10:38,825 --> 00:10:39,659
I hate saying
goodbye, that's all.

178
00:10:39,951 --> 00:10:41,111
Hey, you two, you're making

179
00:10:41,286 --> 00:10:43,788
this public knowledge,
save it for later?

180
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,002
You never give up, do you?

181
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:51,159
What's that supposed to mean?

182
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:53,798
Give her room to
make up her own mind.

183
00:10:54,465 --> 00:10:55,550
If you really love her, the

184
00:10:55,842 --> 00:10:58,595
biggest test is letting
go, not holding on.

185
00:11:08,354 --> 00:11:09,022
Come on, you guys, let's go,

186
00:11:09,314 --> 00:11:10,398
we don't have all night.

187
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:11,730
Jimmy, grab some dirt over

188
00:11:11,983 --> 00:11:13,026
there and get that end.

189
00:11:13,318 --> 00:11:15,153
Tommy, kick the stones
a little closer.

190
00:11:15,903 --> 00:11:17,183
Richie, come on,
Richie, come on,

191
00:11:17,196 --> 00:11:18,517
move it, move it,
move it, Richie!

192
00:11:18,698 --> 00:11:19,699
I'm moving, I'm moving!

193
00:11:20,783 --> 00:11:22,118
What'd you say?

194
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,244
I didn't say anything,
I was talking to the fire.

195
00:11:23,536 --> 00:11:25,079
He didn't say
nothing, I heard him.

196
00:11:25,371 --> 00:11:27,123
Yeah, he lies and
you swear to it.

197
00:11:38,134 --> 00:11:39,218
Okay, that looks good.

198
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,678
Let's line up.

199
00:11:46,142 --> 00:11:48,394
All right, get ready for
a little double time.

200
00:11:48,728 --> 00:11:49,728
I wanna catch them before

201
00:11:49,771 --> 00:11:50,980
they reach the bungalows.

202
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:53,566
Double time in place, go!

203
00:11:56,653 --> 00:11:59,280
One, two, one, two,
one, two, one, two,

204
00:11:59,572 --> 00:12:02,700
one, two, one, two,
move out, let's go!

205
00:14:43,069 --> 00:14:44,509
All right, you guys,
you're released.

206
00:14:44,654 --> 00:14:46,489
Finish packing, clean
up's in a half hour.

207
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,000
Who is it?

208
00:14:58,292 --> 00:14:59,252
It's me, Stacy.

209
00:14:59,794 --> 00:15:00,920
Come on in!

210
00:15:06,342 --> 00:15:07,134
What's up?

211
00:15:07,677 --> 00:15:08,511
Nothing.

212
00:15:09,095 --> 00:15:10,054
You feeling okay?

213
00:15:10,346 --> 00:15:11,639
Yeah, I'm fine.

214
00:15:12,306 --> 00:15:14,976
I always get quiet when
it's over for the season.

215
00:15:15,268 --> 00:15:16,602
He never lets go, does he?

216
00:15:17,061 --> 00:15:18,396
No, he doesn't.

217
00:15:18,813 --> 00:15:21,440
He wants it to go
on and on and on.

218
00:15:21,732 --> 00:15:23,067
Are you gonna see him in town?

219
00:15:23,484 --> 00:15:24,735
I don't know, maybe.

220
00:15:25,486 --> 00:15:27,029
I need some breathing room.

221
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:28,155
Well I'm happy to hear that you

222
00:15:28,447 --> 00:15:31,576
recognize the signs
of a possessive male.

223
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,411
They should having a
big red warning light

224
00:15:33,703 --> 00:15:35,204
screwed into their
foreheads flashing

225
00:15:35,496 --> 00:15:37,164
beware, beware!

226
00:15:37,957 --> 00:15:39,166
That would make it
easier, wouldn't it,

227
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,918
you could see them a mile away.

228
00:15:41,794 --> 00:15:44,380
<i>Beep-hoop, beep-hoop, beep-boom!</i>

229
00:15:45,506 --> 00:15:47,633
And yet there are things
that I like about him.

230
00:15:48,718 --> 00:15:50,761
When we're alone,
he's soft and tender.

231
00:15:51,721 --> 00:15:53,472
I don't know, it's so confusing.

232
00:15:53,764 --> 00:15:54,849
Tell me about it.

233
00:15:55,141 --> 00:15:56,267
They chase you 'til
you're half dead,

234
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:58,769
get you, then try
to get rid of you.

235
00:15:59,103 --> 00:16:00,563
Personally, I don't care
which way they want it,

236
00:16:00,855 --> 00:16:02,356
only make up your mind.

237
00:16:03,024 --> 00:16:04,942
You've had an
interesting life, Stacy.

238
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:06,736
Boring Betsy.

239
00:16:07,069 --> 00:16:09,113
I'm looking forward
to finding me one man,

240
00:16:09,405 --> 00:16:10,865
and I'm gonna stay put.

241
00:16:11,324 --> 00:16:12,950
Anybody special in mind?

242
00:16:13,242 --> 00:16:14,118
A couple.

243
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,454
I didn't say I wanted
to stay put that fast.

244
00:16:17,288 --> 00:16:19,916
But my past is no secret to you.

245
00:16:22,168 --> 00:16:23,568
Listen, Stacy, I
want to thank you

246
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:25,309
for having an ear to
listen and a shoulder

247
00:16:25,588 --> 00:16:27,924
to cry on, there were
times I needed it.

248
00:16:28,215 --> 00:16:30,134
Okay, enough
hearts and flowers.

249
00:16:30,718 --> 00:16:32,094
I'm glad you're feeling better.

250
00:16:32,386 --> 00:16:33,826
I just wanted to
check and make sure.

251
00:16:33,971 --> 00:16:35,097
Thanks, I feel better.

252
00:16:36,349 --> 00:16:38,476
You know Betsy,
I don't have many

253
00:16:38,768 --> 00:16:41,520
women friends, and I
think you're one of them.

254
00:16:41,812 --> 00:16:42,813
Well I am.

255
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:44,899
Hey, give me your
number in the city, huh?

256
00:16:45,191 --> 00:16:46,275
Yeah, tomorrow.

257
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:47,652
Better hurry, we got clean
up in a couple of minutes.

258
00:16:47,944 --> 00:16:48,611
See you later.

259
00:16:48,903 --> 00:16:50,112
<i>'</i> - Bye bye. - ' Bye.

260
00:16:52,573 --> 00:16:54,533
Hey Max, is your
offer of 100 bucks

261
00:16:54,825 --> 00:16:55,451
to anyone who can pull this

262
00:16:55,743 --> 00:16:56,953
axe out of here still good?

263
00:16:57,244 --> 00:16:58,245
Yeah, it's still good!

264
00:17:09,048 --> 00:17:10,288
Come on, Max, give me a hand,

265
00:17:10,466 --> 00:17:11,884
let's get this axe outta here!

266
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:26,774
Come on, Dippy, give us a hand!

267
00:17:42,581 --> 00:17:44,250
Oh, let it go, TP.

268
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:47,128
We lost, there'll
be another time.

269
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,422
Maybe, but I don't like losing.

270
00:17:50,047 --> 00:17:52,258
Losing, winning,
what's the difference?

271
00:17:52,675 --> 00:17:53,926
Play the game with a fair heart

272
00:17:54,218 --> 00:17:55,218
and you'll always be able

273
00:17:55,428 --> 00:17:56,668
to look yourself in the mirror.

274
00:17:58,681 --> 00:18:01,100
Play too hard to win, and you

275
00:18:01,392 --> 00:18:03,269
might not like what you become.

276
00:18:05,438 --> 00:18:06,939
You become a winner.

277
00:18:07,648 --> 00:18:09,150
That's what you become.

278
00:18:22,163 --> 00:18:24,123
Dippy, it's empty-

279
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,998
- I don't see Richie anywhere.

280
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,891
He must have stayed
back at the campfire.

281
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,921
What are we gonna do?

282
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,650
Make up his bed
like he's sleeping.

283
00:19:11,003 --> 00:19:13,047
We got to give him
more time to get back.

284
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:14,499
Richie knows what he's doing.

285
00:21:20,758 --> 00:21:22,426
I'll make this short and sweet.

286
00:21:25,137 --> 00:21:26,263
Thanks, now I'll never stop.

287
00:21:27,348 --> 00:21:28,891
I think you all
contributed something

288
00:21:29,183 --> 00:21:31,477
to the growth of the
people as individuals

289
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:33,562
and the kids in
general that will

290
00:21:33,854 --> 00:21:35,606
stay with them the
rest of their lives.

291
00:21:35,898 --> 00:21:37,778
Yeah, they'll never go
out in the woods alone.

292
00:21:37,858 --> 00:21:38,734
Ever again.

293
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,864
Max, I'd like to say
something about the campfire.

294
00:21:44,156 --> 00:21:45,241
Sure, Betsy.

295
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,160
I know how you
enjoy telling stories

296
00:21:48,452 --> 00:21:50,079
around a fire, and I
don't wanna ruin it,

297
00:21:50,371 --> 00:21:51,651
but I'm concerned
with the effect

298
00:21:51,789 --> 00:21:52,706
it has on the
younger ones, they're

299
00:21:52,998 --> 00:21:54,238
in tears by the time it's over,

300
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:55,571
I don't think it's
good for them.

301
00:21:55,834 --> 00:21:57,675
That's a good point,
I never thought of that.

302
00:21:57,962 --> 00:21:59,162
I don't have any objections to

303
00:21:59,421 --> 00:22:01,181
excluding the younger
kids from the campfire.

304
00:22:02,216 --> 00:22:03,537
Next year, I'll
scare the hell out

305
00:22:03,592 --> 00:22:05,261
of only the older
ones, okay, Betsy?

306
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:07,972
I like to keep my staff happy.

307
00:22:08,264 --> 00:22:09,265
Within reason of course.

308
00:22:09,598 --> 00:22:10,516
All right, I'm
going into town to

309
00:22:10,808 --> 00:22:12,088
pick up the shutters
from Sunny's

310
00:22:12,101 --> 00:22:15,104
and play some cards,
anybody need anything?

311
00:22:15,396 --> 00:22:17,815
Yeah, but you ain't
gonna find it at Sunny's.

312
00:22:18,524 --> 00:22:19,900
Down, girl.

313
00:22:20,192 --> 00:22:22,033
You'll be back in the
big city in a day or two.

314
00:22:22,236 --> 00:22:24,238
You can get anything
you want there.

315
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,115
Hold it, I'm getting a bit

316
00:22:26,407 --> 00:22:28,200
too old for this kind of talk.

317
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:29,702
I'm leaving.

318
00:22:30,411 --> 00:22:31,412
Bye, Max.

319
00:22:31,704 --> 00:22:33,330
Oh, before I
forget, that beer you

320
00:22:33,622 --> 00:22:34,456
got hidden in the bottom of the

321
00:22:34,748 --> 00:22:36,792
refrigerator against orders...

322
00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:39,795
Save me one.

323
00:22:40,212 --> 00:22:41,533
I'll be back in a
couple of hours.

324
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,965
Keep a sharp eye on the kids.

325
00:22:43,257 --> 00:22:45,259
TP, you're in charge!

326
00:22:52,182 --> 00:22:54,685
I'd like to get into
something a bit more personal.

327
00:22:56,061 --> 00:22:57,813
Tonight, you all
witnessed a scene

328
00:22:58,105 --> 00:23:00,357
between Betsy and me
up at the campfire

329
00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:02,443
that should have never happened.

330
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:05,029
I'd like to publicly
apologize to Betsy

331
00:23:05,321 --> 00:23:06,989
and to the rest of
you for subjecting

332
00:23:07,281 --> 00:23:09,491
you to my petty and
selfish attitude.

333
00:23:11,327 --> 00:23:12,244
That's it, folks.

334
00:23:20,502 --> 00:23:21,920
I propose a toast.

335
00:23:22,254 --> 00:23:23,335
- Yeah.
- Well the man wants

336
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,465
a toast, so be it.

337
00:23:25,466 --> 00:23:27,051
To friends and friendship.

338
00:23:28,052 --> 00:23:29,720
To love, and lovers.

339
00:23:31,013 --> 00:23:32,890
May you always have
more than you need.

00:26:43,288 --> 00:26:44,581
you didn't let me finish.

375
00:26:45,207 --> 00:26:46,250
Please,

376
00:26:46,542 --> 00:26:48,126
You men are all alike!

377
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:01,575
Where am I?

378
00:28:27,267 --> 00:28:28,226
Damn.

379
00:29:13,063 --> 00:29:15,148
Okay, girl, let's go.

380
00:29:15,816 --> 00:29:16,942
You can do it.

381
00:29:18,068 --> 00:29:21,405
Up, I said go, yes!

382
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:25,826
Up.

383
00:29:35,168 --> 00:29:36,420
Pbbbt!

384
00:29:49,224 --> 00:29:50,726
Great fire, Bill.

385
00:29:51,143 --> 00:29:52,185
Thanks.

386
00:29:52,477 --> 00:29:54,813
I love to feel the
flames devour the wood.

387
00:29:55,522 --> 00:29:57,482
Who says there's no
beauty in destruction?

388
00:29:57,899 --> 00:30:01,069
I don't think there's beauty
in any kind of destruction.

389
00:30:01,862 --> 00:30:02,988
For any reason.

390
00:30:04,448 --> 00:30:06,158
I'd say that
depends on the reason.

391
00:30:06,616 --> 00:30:09,119
For as long as our
reason stays reasonable.

392
00:30:09,911 --> 00:30:12,122
That's the most frightening
thing about us humans.

393
00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:34,811
You never really know what's

394
00:30:35,103 --> 00:30:37,689
in my mind at any given time.

395
00:30:39,191 --> 00:30:40,391
You never know if I'm thinking

396
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,526
rationally, or if I've

397
00:30:41,818 --> 00:30:44,154
created some other reality.

398
00:30:44,821 --> 00:30:49,493
That seems to fit, that
seems to be normal.

399
00:30:51,036 --> 00:30:55,957
But you never really know
what normal is to me.

400
00:30:59,419 --> 00:31:01,922
You never really know.

401
00:31:02,964 --> 00:31:04,341
Dave, are you okay?

402
00:31:04,633 --> 00:31:05,842
Of course, Ellie.

403
00:31:06,301 --> 00:31:09,012
I'm letting my emotions
overcome my intellect.

404
00:31:11,181 --> 00:31:12,516
See what happens?

405
00:31:14,226 --> 00:31:17,646
See how easy it is to
question another human mind?

406
00:31:19,689 --> 00:31:21,024
I can judge by
your faces there's

407
00:31:21,316 --> 00:31:22,943
a question about me.

408
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:26,238
A touch of fear in your eyes.

409
00:31:26,863 --> 00:31:28,949
Who is this man, where
does he come from?

410
00:31:29,699 --> 00:31:34,621
I could take your
bodies, one at a time,

411
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:38,083
and hide them so no one
would ever find them.

412
00:31:39,251 --> 00:31:40,752
I could...

413
00:31:43,296 --> 00:31:46,925
Chop off your heads!

414
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,472
Jimmy, can you, can
you tell me anything

415
00:32:34,764 --> 00:32:36,808
about where Richie
the wise guy is?

416
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,316
Okay, get back to sleep.

417
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:47,235
Nobody leaves this cabin.

418
00:32:48,069 --> 00:32:49,070
That's an order.

419
00:33:05,337 --> 00:33:06,588
I'm gonna try and find him.

420
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,640
Why don't you get.

421
00:33:07,714 --> 00:33:08,965
Bill and Dave to help?

422
00:33:09,257 --> 00:33:11,343
I lost him, it's my
responsibility to find him.

423
00:33:11,635 --> 00:33:12,802
So dark out there, more

424
00:33:13,094 --> 00:33:14,134
people looking the better.

425
00:33:14,512 --> 00:33:15,633
Don't worry, I'm just gonna

426
00:33:15,847 --> 00:33:17,168
take a quick look,
if I don't find

427
00:33:17,265 --> 00:33:18,141
them I'll be back in
awhile to get the others.

428
00:33:18,516 --> 00:33:20,185
You wait in the
office and stay awake.

429
00:33:20,644 --> 00:33:21,728
Yes, sir!

430
00:33:23,063 --> 00:33:24,189
TP...

431
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,483
Be careful.

432
00:33:39,371 --> 00:33:40,455
TP?

433
00:33:47,212 --> 00:33:49,422
Nothing, it's okay, be careful.

434
00:34:11,653 --> 00:34:12,654
Were you serious about

435
00:34:12,946 --> 00:34:14,322
what you said this afternoon?

436
00:34:15,281 --> 00:34:16,441
Did it shock you that much?

437
00:34:16,783 --> 00:34:18,827
No, I only want you to be sure

438
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,246
of leaving school and me.

439
00:34:21,538 --> 00:34:23,957
I told you, I love you.

440
00:34:24,457 --> 00:34:25,959
I wanna be with you.

441
00:34:26,626 --> 00:34:27,877
Anymore doubts?

442
00:34:28,211 --> 00:34:28,837
No.

443
00:34:29,462 --> 00:34:30,755
No more doubts.

444
00:34:34,175 --> 00:34:37,178
Great moon tonight,
eh, Billy boy?

445
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,180
Yeah, great moon tonight.

446
00:34:39,514 --> 00:34:40,390
Yeah.

447
00:34:42,225 --> 00:34:43,810
Let's go for a swim.

448
00:34:44,185 --> 00:34:45,311
I have a better idea.

449
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,763
Richie!

450
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:23,850
Richie!

451
00:35:29,981 --> 00:35:31,649
Richie!

452
00:35:40,241 --> 00:35:41,201
Richie?

453
00:35:43,661 --> 00:35:44,954
That you, Richie?

454
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:49,834
Come on, Richie.

455
00:35:50,126 --> 00:35:51,846
Come on out, I know
you're in there, Richie.

456
00:35:52,504 --> 00:35:53,880
Come on out, Richie!

457
00:37:18,256 --> 00:37:19,057
Smells like death...

458
00:39:13,454 --> 00:39:14,831
He loves me not.

459
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:17,709
He loves me.

460
00:39:19,335 --> 00:39:21,129
He loves me not.

461
00:39:22,547 --> 00:39:23,798
He loves me.

462
00:39:25,883 --> 00:39:27,218
As if I didn't know.

463
00:39:31,973 --> 00:39:33,516
Oh TP, where are you?

464
00:39:36,185 --> 00:39:37,705
Then he said he'd be
back in 10 minutes

465
00:39:37,854 --> 00:39:39,480
and left, it's been close to 45

466
00:39:39,772 --> 00:39:41,983
and that's not like TP,
you know that, Dave.

467
00:39:42,275 --> 00:39:43,067
Yeah, I know.

468
00:39:44,193 --> 00:39:46,029
This happens at
least twice a year.

469
00:39:46,446 --> 00:39:47,926
Last year it took
us about three hours

470
00:39:48,031 --> 00:39:49,231
to track down a kid who made a

471
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,116
left instead of
a right and wound

472
00:39:50,408 --> 00:39:51,826
up in the North fork.

473
00:39:52,201 --> 00:39:53,494
That was in broad daylight.

474
00:39:54,746 --> 00:39:56,289
Betsy, I'm surprised at you.

475
00:39:56,914 --> 00:39:58,624
I didn't know you
were such a worrier.

476
00:39:58,916 --> 00:40:00,251
Why the strange
look in your eyes?

477
00:40:01,586 --> 00:40:04,213
Well you two are
gonna laugh, but...

478
00:40:05,256 --> 00:40:06,841
As TP was leaving,
I saw something

479
00:40:07,133 --> 00:40:08,259
by the side of the house.

480
00:40:09,093 --> 00:40:10,333
It was big, I couldn't make out

481
00:40:10,428 --> 00:40:11,554
any features because
of the shadows...

482
00:40:11,846 --> 00:40:13,139
Okay, Betsy, I get your point,

483
00:40:13,431 --> 00:40:14,515
I'll go looking for him.

484
00:40:14,974 --> 00:40:16,295
No need to make
up anymore stories

485
00:40:16,392 --> 00:40:18,102
for the dramatic effect.

486
00:40:18,394 --> 00:40:19,979
I'm not making up any stories.

487
00:40:20,271 --> 00:40:21,856
What happened to this shadow?

488
00:40:22,148 --> 00:40:23,733
Well the next
time I looked up...

489
00:40:24,942 --> 00:40:26,110
It was gone.

490
00:40:26,402 --> 00:40:28,402
Okay, I'm leaving, look,
see how fast I'm moving?

491
00:40:28,446 --> 00:40:30,031
Dave, don't make
fun of me please.

492
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,158
Okay, I'm sorry.

493
00:40:33,743 --> 00:40:35,161
Don't worry so much.

494
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,288
I'll find him one two three.

495
00:40:40,416 --> 00:40:42,251
Keep her company until
we get back, okay?

496
00:40:51,511 --> 00:40:53,096
I saw something out there.

497
00:40:54,972 --> 00:40:55,973
I did.

498
00:40:58,351 --> 00:40:59,936
At least I think I did.

499
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:03,958
TP!

500
00:42:05,334 --> 00:42:06,335
You out there?!

501
00:42:08,379 --> 00:42:09,380
TP!

502
00:42:12,258 --> 00:42:13,259
Richie!

503
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:33,529
TP!

504
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,158
Richie!

505
00:43:10,233 --> 00:43:11,400
TP!

506
00:43:13,528 --> 00:43:15,196
TP, where are you?!

507
00:43:17,573 --> 00:43:18,699
Richie!

508
00:44:45,202 --> 00:44:46,829
TP!

509
00:46:31,517 --> 00:46:35,187
Betsy, I think we
should go in the office.

510
00:46:36,439 --> 00:46:37,231
Yeah?

511
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:39,108
Tommy, what's up?

512
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:40,401
Nothing.

513
00:46:41,736 --> 00:46:42,695
I don't think.

514
00:46:50,286 --> 00:46:51,579
Betsy, wait here.

515
00:46:52,121 --> 00:46:53,038
I'm gonna go find Bill and Ellie

516
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:55,090
and then take a ride to
the end of the trail.

517
00:46:55,249 --> 00:46:56,792
I think we should
both stay here.

518
00:46:57,084 --> 00:46:57,835
Well Betsy, that's
the difference

519
00:46:58,127 --> 00:46:59,128
between you and me.

520
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:01,255
You're content to sit
behind and I'm not.

521
00:47:01,714 --> 00:47:03,048
I like to know what's going on.

522
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:04,580
I'll see you in a little while.

523
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,154
<i>Whoops.</i>

524
00:47:26,655 --> 00:47:28,240
Stacy, don't you ever knock?

525
00:47:28,532 --> 00:47:31,118
Sorry, I don't usually
bust in like this,

526
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:33,162
but we need you both
up in the office.

527
00:47:33,454 --> 00:47:34,255
What's the matter?

528
00:47:34,622 --> 00:47:35,706
I don't know.

529
00:47:35,998 --> 00:47:37,166
Richie's been missing
since the campfire

530
00:47:37,458 --> 00:47:38,959
and TP went to find him and then.

531
00:47:39,251 --> 00:47:40,291
Dave went to find them and

532
00:47:40,294 --> 00:47:42,004
nobody's returned
yet, so I figured

533
00:47:42,296 --> 00:47:43,377
it would be better if we're

534
00:47:43,464 --> 00:47:44,590
all available for duty.

535
00:47:45,299 --> 00:47:46,050
Soto speak.

536
00:47:46,342 --> 00:47:47,582
How long have they been gone?

537
00:47:47,593 --> 00:47:48,928
I don't know for sure.

538
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:50,763
Too long as far
as I'm concerned.

539
00:47:51,055 --> 00:47:52,056
I gotta get back.

540
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,016
Sorry again, you two.

541
00:47:54,308 --> 00:47:57,978
Don't rush, but hurry
if you know what I mean.

542
00:47:58,270 --> 00:47:59,104
We're coming.

543
00:47:59,396 --> 00:48:00,397
Be right there.

544
00:49:18,684 --> 00:49:20,227
Why isn't there
another flashlight?

545
00:51:00,327 --> 00:51:01,495
I don't like it.

546
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:04,415
I wish Max would get back,

547
00:51:04,707 --> 00:51:06,000
he always knows what to do

548
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:07,376
in an emergency.

549
00:51:07,668 --> 00:51:08,948
Easy, Ellie, this isn't exactly

550
00:51:09,003 --> 00:51:11,130
an emergency, Max would
do what we're doing.

551
00:51:11,547 --> 00:51:13,173
We gotta search for a lost kid.

552
00:51:13,924 --> 00:51:14,964
Only TP should have called

553
00:51:14,967 --> 00:51:15,926
the whole group together instead

554
00:51:16,218 --> 00:51:17,219
of going off on his
own, the more people

555
00:51:17,511 --> 00:51:19,054
you have searching,
the better it is.

556
00:51:19,346 --> 00:51:20,306
What are you gonna do?

557
00:51:20,514 --> 00:51:21,849
I'm gonna catch up with Stacy.

558
00:51:22,266 --> 00:51:23,017
What about you?

559
00:51:23,308 --> 00:51:24,935
Well if it's
better to have more

560
00:51:25,227 --> 00:51:26,937
people looking, then
I'll go with you.

561
00:51:28,147 --> 00:51:29,231
You okay here alone?

562
00:51:29,523 --> 00:51:30,649
Alone?

563
00:51:30,941 --> 00:51:32,985
I've got five kids to
look after, who's alone?

564
00:51:34,194 --> 00:51:36,071
Only get back as
soon as you can, huh?

565
00:51:36,363 --> 00:51:38,032
I don't want Max to
find everybody gone.

566
00:51:38,323 --> 00:51:39,241
He's funny that way.

567
00:51:39,616 --> 00:51:41,376
We'll gather the group
and come right back.

568
00:51:41,577 --> 00:51:42,857
Good, that's what I wanna hear.

569
00:52:11,023 --> 00:52:12,066
TP!

570
00:52:14,902 --> 00:52:15,736
Dave!

571
00:52:19,239 --> 00:52:20,199
Richie!

572
00:53:07,287 --> 00:53:08,163
Dave?!

573
00:53:13,585 --> 00:53:14,545
TP?!

574
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:17,714
Richie!

575
00:53:35,274 --> 00:53:36,191
Dave!

576
00:53:37,693 --> 00:53:38,902
Where are you?!

577
00:53:56,378 --> 00:53:58,380
Dave, are you hurt?

578
00:56:58,352 --> 00:56:59,394
" Stacy?!

579
00:57:00,354 --> 00:57:01,146
Stacy!

580
00:57:04,191 --> 00:57:05,067
There's the pickup.

581
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:06,151
Yeah, I see it.

582
00:57:06,735 --> 00:57:07,861
She's in the woods already.

583
00:57:09,988 --> 00:57:11,531
Look, the campfire
area's that way.

584
00:57:12,074 --> 00:57:13,274
If you move close to the trail

585
00:57:13,325 --> 00:57:15,166
and I go this way we'll
make a complete circle.

586
00:57:16,203 --> 00:57:17,120
Be careful.

587
00:57:17,412 --> 00:57:18,080
You too.

588
00:57:18,372 --> 00:57:18,933
Are you ready?

589
00:57:19,122 --> 00:57:20,499
Ready as I'll ever be.

590
00:59:07,147 --> 00:59:08,064
Bill!

591
00:59:21,328 --> 00:59:22,608
What is it, baby, what's wrong?

592
00:59:22,829 --> 00:59:24,664
Oh Bill, I saw
something horrible!

593
00:59:25,123 --> 00:59:27,250
It was big and huge and dark.

594
00:59:27,792 --> 00:59:29,044
I don't know.
I'm gonna go see for myself,

595
00:59:29,336 --> 00:59:30,754
you wanna wait here
or come with me?

596
00:59:31,046 --> 00:59:32,672
Why can't we go
back to the office?

597
00:59:32,964 --> 00:59:33,965
What good is that?

598
00:59:34,257 --> 00:59:35,091
Let's find out for
sure what you saw,

599
00:59:35,383 --> 00:59:36,843
if anything at all, okay?

600
00:59:37,344 --> 00:59:40,138
Okay, but don't
let go of my hand.

601
00:59:57,447 --> 00:59:58,823
I don't see anything, Ellie.

602
01:00:21,179 --> 01:00:22,013
Nothing.

603
01:00:23,056 --> 01:00:25,100
Yeah, let's go back now.

604
01:00:26,059 --> 01:00:27,519
Okay, let's go.

605
01:01:23,491 --> 01:01:24,909
Oh God!

606
01:01:26,494 --> 01:01:27,579
What is it, Bill?

607
01:01:27,871 --> 01:01:28,992
Nothing, stay in the truck!

608
01:02:41,486 --> 01:02:42,862
Ellie!

609
01:04:54,202 --> 01:04:55,245
Holy shit.

610
01:07:11,339 --> 01:07:12,465
" Betsy!

611
01:07:14,008 --> 01:07:16,177
Betsy, where are you?!

612
01:07:36,072 --> 01:07:37,240
Betsy!

613
01:07:39,826 --> 01:07:40,702
Betsy!

614
01:07:59,512 --> 01:08:00,638
Betsy!

615
01:08:02,515 --> 01:08:03,433
Betsy!

616
01:08:06,602 --> 01:08:07,937
Are you here?!

617
01:08:10,815 --> 01:08:12,191
Where's Betsy?

618
01:08:17,655 --> 01:08:18,740
Betsy?

619
01:08:21,451 --> 01:08:23,036
Anybody?

620
01:08:48,102 --> 01:08:49,187
Betsy?

621
01:14:44,083 --> 01:14:45,167
Max, get me Max.

622
01:14:46,836 --> 01:14:48,421
Max, it's Betsy!

623
01:14:48,712 --> 01:14:49,839
You gotta come back!

624
01:14:50,339 --> 01:14:51,632
There's blood all
over the place!

625
01:14:51,924 --> 01:14:53,926
Hold on, Betsy, what
are you talking about?

626
01:14:54,218 --> 01:14:55,052
I don't know, I don't
know, I don't know,

627
01:14:55,344 --> 01:14:56,178
it's just blood all
over the fireplace

628
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:57,847
you gotta come back now!

629
01:14:58,139 --> 01:14:59,019
I'll be right there!

630
01:14:59,432 --> 01:15:00,224
Please.

631
01:15:01,267 --> 01:15:02,101
Please hurry.

632
01:17:10,229 --> 01:17:11,230
Ellie?

633
01:17:17,987 --> 01:17:19,071
Wake everybody up!

634
01:17:37,506 --> 01:17:38,841
Okay, let's go, there's
no time to change,

635
01:17:39,133 --> 01:17:41,093
come on, get your
coats on, let's go.

636
01:17:41,385 --> 01:17:42,052
Bart, leave everything and

637
01:17:42,344 --> 01:17:43,804
get to the bus right now!

638
01:17:44,263 --> 01:17:45,723
Come on, let's go, come on!

639
01:17:49,685 --> 01:17:50,561
Come on.

640
01:17:55,316 --> 01:17:56,525
Get into the bus.

641
01:19:00,422 --> 01:19:01,882
Leave us alone!

642
01:19:03,092 --> 01:19:03,884
Stop it!

643
01:19:05,094 --> 01:19:06,804
GO away!

644
01:19:09,723 --> 01:19:11,225
Leave us alone!

645
01:19:13,310 --> 01:19:14,144
Go!

646
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:16,230
GO away!

647
01:19:39,253 --> 01:19:40,421
Ellie...

648
01:19:44,049 --> 01:19:45,217
I've got to find the others,

649
01:19:45,509 --> 01:19:47,261
gotta see if anybody's alive.

650
01:19:47,553 --> 01:19:49,054
Drive directly to
the police station,

651
01:19:49,346 --> 01:19:50,514
don't stop for anything.

652
01:19:50,806 --> 01:19:51,473
All right.

653
01:19:51,849 --> 01:19:53,642
Oh Betsy, don't leave us.

654
01:19:55,018 --> 01:19:56,228
I'm sorry, honey.

655
01:19:57,187 --> 01:19:58,105
I love you.

656
01:20:10,284 --> 01:20:11,660
Just get moving!

657
01:24:33,964 --> 01:24:35,090
Help me!

658
01:24:35,841 --> 01:24:36,842
Help!

659
01:25:48,163 --> 01:25:49,915
Richie, Richie!
