1
00:01:35,656 --> 00:01:38,336
<i>Achtung Achtung! Feind in Sicht.</i>

2
00:01:38,492 --> 00:01:40,960
<i>Alles in Stellung. Alles in Stellung.</i>

3
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:45,717
<i>Alle Maschinen für den Kampf bereit.</i>

4
00:02:45,934 --> 00:02:49,066
- You're off course by two degrees.
- Yes Sir!

5
00:02:50,605 --> 00:02:53,109
You've got to watch them all the time...

6
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,038
Captain...

7
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,661
...otherwise they'll become sloppy.

8
00:03:00,282 --> 00:03:03,129
They'll become very, very sloppy.

9
00:03:05,203 --> 00:03:07,209
I think we should join the party, Captain.

10
00:03:08,165 --> 00:03:09,921
Damn the passengers...

11
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,971
...to see, to become a Captain,

12
00:03:12,252 --> 00:03:13,593
...not a party host...

13
00:03:14,004 --> 00:03:15,048
...you take care of her.

14
00:03:16,548 --> 00:03:19,016
She'll be all yours in another three days.

15
00:03:20,594 --> 00:03:21,637
I will.

16
00:03:24,014 --> 00:03:25,853
Check her position every 30 minutes...

17
00:03:26,224 --> 00:03:29,772
...and tell the purser I will NOT be
attending the over 50s party tomorrow.

18
00:03:29,936 --> 00:03:30,979
Yes Sir!

19
00:03:31,772 --> 00:03:33,444
Unless you'd care to go...

20
00:03:33,774 --> 00:03:36,621
...I'm told you're an
excellent conversationalist.

21
00:03:37,486 --> 00:03:39,325
That depends on whom I'm talking to Sir.

22
00:03:41,198 --> 00:03:42,289
Bastard!

23
00:03:42,574 --> 00:03:43,997
Thank God it's his last trip!

24
00:04:04,054 --> 00:04:06,771
- Come on everyone, let's move!
- Good evening Mrs. Marshall.

25
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:13,855
Nick, I want to dance!

26
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,035
I wish I was 20 years younger!

27
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,245
You're not Cyril,
you'll have to dance with me.

28
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,841
Why don't you go to bed,
you can't keep your eyes open?

29
00:04:37,045 --> 00:04:38,433
Yes I can!

30
00:04:39,131 --> 00:04:42,061
Another half hour Long John Silver
and you're going to bed!

31
00:04:42,301 --> 00:04:43,343
That's not fair!

32
00:04:43,468 --> 00:04:45,473
She's staying up, why can't I?

33
00:04:45,679 --> 00:04:46,722
I'm older.

34
00:04:47,764 --> 00:04:49,485
Now that's enough, both of you.

35
00:05:02,529 --> 00:05:04,000
Ooh baby!

36
00:05:06,616 --> 00:05:08,040
You can come with me!

37
00:05:08,243 --> 00:05:09,286
Hey, great!

38
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:12,629
Now we've all had lots of booze
and what have...

39
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:14,592
...you all must be feeling very happy?

40
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,428
Let me hear yah, happy?

41
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,965
I can't hear you, a little louder,
are you happy?

42
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:08,388
Oh, Ladies and Gentlemen,
I see our captain has joined us.

43
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,513
Captain, welcome.

44
00:06:09,638 --> 00:06:10,812
On behalf of everybody, Captain...

45
00:06:10,973 --> 00:06:13,393
...I would like to thank you
for a very smooth trip...

46
00:06:13,558 --> 00:06:15,231
...especially the overland section.

47
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:17,360
Captain, how about a little bow?

48
00:06:18,855 --> 00:06:20,362
Let's hear it for the Captain!

49
00:06:24,277 --> 00:06:25,535
Thank you.

50
00:06:28,115 --> 00:06:30,914
Gentlemen, a little music if you please.

51
00:06:34,538 --> 00:06:38,334
Forty years at sea and you end up being a
straight man for a smart-ass comedian.

52
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:42,296
I wonder what sort of jokes he'll make
about me when I take command?

53
00:06:42,421 --> 00:06:44,841
None darling.
Nobody ever makes jokes about you.

54
00:06:46,675 --> 00:06:48,063
Am I as stuffy as that?

55
00:06:48,218 --> 00:06:49,429
I wouldn't know.

56
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,476
I hardly ever see you out of your uniform.

57
00:06:53,765 --> 00:06:55,023
Wait until tonight.

58
00:07:27,466 --> 00:07:30,313
Sir... take a look a this.

59
00:07:36,558 --> 00:07:38,112
It's on a collision course!

60
00:07:38,602 --> 00:07:39,812
Twenty degrees port!

61
00:08:18,141 --> 00:08:19,981
Can I have that please?

62
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,353
Ben!

63
00:08:23,605 --> 00:08:25,326
Is it past your bedtime?

64
00:08:25,983 --> 00:08:27,703
Ben, that's greedy!

65
00:08:28,151 --> 00:08:31,200
Robin, be an angel and take Ben
below and put him to bed.

66
00:08:31,446 --> 00:08:32,205
Say goodnight, Ben.

67
00:08:32,322 --> 00:08:33,365
Come on!

68
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,167
Good night mum.

69
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:40,921
Good night son.

70
00:08:42,624 --> 00:08:43,667
I'm sorry!

71
00:08:53,802 --> 00:08:55,225
Thank you band, thank you.

72
00:08:55,762 --> 00:08:57,186
Now, Ladies and Gentlemen...

73
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,238
...we are coming to the
end of a very long...

74
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,491
...and beautiful voyage.

75
00:09:08,233 --> 00:09:10,319
How about a little appreciation
for a great band...

76
00:09:10,652 --> 00:09:12,159
...Mal Diamond and the Boys.

77
00:09:18,452 --> 00:09:20,836
Maybe you'll get used to all of this.
I never did.

78
00:09:22,456 --> 00:09:24,675
Cruising around in endless circles...

79
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:29,637
...blue-rinse ladies repeating "have
a nice day!" over and over again...

80
00:09:29,921 --> 00:09:31,594
...and then having to
have dinner with them...

81
00:09:31,673 --> 00:09:35,137
...so that they can go back to Akron
or Toronto or wherever...

82
00:09:35,302 --> 00:09:37,054
...and say that they ate with the Captain.

83
00:09:47,564 --> 00:09:49,035
I thought daddy was the Captain?

84
00:09:49,191 --> 00:09:51,278
No dummy, not till the next trip!

85
00:09:51,443 --> 00:09:54,291
Good! Then I can get all the cake I want!

86
00:09:54,905 --> 00:09:56,376
Ben, come back!

87
00:10:32,317 --> 00:10:33,788
Whatcha doing now?

88
00:10:34,027 --> 00:10:35,071
I gotta go!

89
00:10:35,237 --> 00:10:36,279
You've just been!

90
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,451
Well I gotta go again.

91
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,783
Ben.

92
00:10:40,617 --> 00:10:41,660
Women.

93
00:10:52,587 --> 00:10:54,806
It's as if it's deliberately
trying to ram us.

94
00:10:56,258 --> 00:10:57,515
Full to port.

95
00:10:57,884 --> 00:10:58,927
Fast!

96
00:11:01,763 --> 00:11:03,187
Get me the Captain.

97
00:11:07,686 --> 00:11:10,486
My Husband was so anxious
to come on this cruise.

98
00:11:11,315 --> 00:11:13,818
But, when God calls,
you have to go.

99
00:11:14,192 --> 00:11:16,328
- Pardon?
- He died, just before we sailed.

100
00:11:16,862 --> 00:11:19,994
I'm not grieving.
I mean, he had a wonderful life.

101
00:11:20,365 --> 00:11:22,451
And he would have wanted
me to come on this cruise.

102
00:11:22,576 --> 00:11:24,830
- Are you a religious man?
- Excuse me.

103
00:11:26,121 --> 00:11:30,001
He's a wonderful man.
But he's not religious.

104
00:11:30,334 --> 00:11:31,377
How many more days?

105
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,753
Two and a half.

106
00:11:33,045 --> 00:11:34,172
Are you counting?

107
00:11:35,213 --> 00:11:37,717
Now listen,
you promise you'll forget me!

108
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,177
I promise.

109
00:11:41,678 --> 00:11:44,359
I know.
You say that to all the girls.

110
00:11:44,514 --> 00:11:45,557
You're right.

111
00:11:46,642 --> 00:11:48,481
What do you want me to say?

112
00:11:50,395 --> 00:11:52,650
I don't want you to say anything.

113
00:12:10,123 --> 00:12:11,511
Signal him to alter course!

114
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:12,960
We have, Sir!

115
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,930
Well signal him again, dammit!

116
00:12:16,797 --> 00:12:18,387
Full astern!

117
00:13:13,687 --> 00:13:15,490
Let's get the hell out of here!

118
00:13:15,856 --> 00:13:17,113
It's going down fast!

119
00:13:17,441 --> 00:13:18,483
Come on!

120
00:13:18,525 --> 00:13:19,568
Come on, let's go!

121
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,903
We've got to hold our position.

122
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:01,321
Make it easier for Air and Sea Rescue.

123
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,241
They did get a distress
signal off, didn't they?

124
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,707
Of course they did.

125
00:14:57,207 --> 00:14:58,299
Daddy, daddy!

126
00:14:58,709 --> 00:14:59,302
What is it?

127
00:14:59,584 --> 00:15:00,925
There's something in the water!

128
00:15:08,635 --> 00:15:09,809
Give me a hand!

129
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,013
Come on!

130
00:15:11,972 --> 00:15:13,146
It's the Captain!

131
00:15:14,641 --> 00:15:15,684
The poor man!

132
00:15:21,273 --> 00:15:22,316
Make some room.

133
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:26,653
Give him air.

134
00:15:27,446 --> 00:15:29,036
He's breathing, He's alright.

135
00:15:29,239 --> 00:15:31,493
- Captain, you poor thing!
- He'll be alright.

136
00:15:33,702 --> 00:15:35,339
Is he alright?

137
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:39,126
What can we do for him?

138
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,267
Wake up Margaret!

139
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:29,973
Margaret, it's a ship!

140
00:16:30,342 --> 00:16:31,385
Wake up!

141
00:16:32,177 --> 00:16:33,220
Ahoy!

142
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:35,973
Ahoy!

143
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,683
Ahoy!

144
00:16:40,018 --> 00:16:41,572
Hello up there!

145
00:16:42,062 --> 00:16:44,067
Is anybody up there, Ahoy!

146
00:16:46,316 --> 00:16:47,870
Ahoy!

147
00:16:54,825 --> 00:16:57,624
Hello! Ahoy!

148
00:17:05,544 --> 00:17:07,050
Ahoy!

149
00:17:07,337 --> 00:17:08,725
Ahoy!

150
00:17:23,895 --> 00:17:25,070
Hello!

151
00:17:29,192 --> 00:17:31,114
Is anybody up there?

152
00:17:33,697 --> 00:17:36,414
Hey! Anybody home?

153
00:17:41,997 --> 00:17:43,040
Look!

154
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,011
They've lowered the ladder!

155
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:46,835
Well at least someone on board heard us.

156
00:17:50,172 --> 00:17:52,640
What would a ship
be doing anchored out here?

157
00:17:52,966 --> 00:17:55,185
I don't know.
Maybe some sort of engine failure?

158
00:17:58,722 --> 00:17:59,814
Steady! Steady!

159
00:18:00,557 --> 00:18:01,600
Right. I got it.

160
00:18:06,188 --> 00:18:07,279
Mind the Captain!

161
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:13,991
Nick, go take a look.

162
00:18:35,884 --> 00:18:36,596
Hello?

163
00:18:36,718 --> 00:18:37,892
Hello, anyone on watch?

164
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:39,222
Hello! Hello!

165
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:40,973
Anybody here?

166
00:18:41,056 --> 00:18:42,099
Hello!

167
00:19:00,784 --> 00:19:02,670
There's no one here!

168
00:19:03,996 --> 00:19:05,206
Okay Ben, up you go.

169
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,623
Careful now.

170
00:19:18,969 --> 00:19:20,143
You next.

171
00:19:23,974 --> 00:19:25,611
Come on Robin. Come on.

172
00:19:26,727 --> 00:19:28,483
Come on. Give me your hand.

173
00:19:33,025 --> 00:19:34,199
See where he's going.

174
00:19:34,443 --> 00:19:36,448
Ben! Come here!

175
00:19:44,328 --> 00:19:45,370
Ben!

176
00:19:48,832 --> 00:19:49,875
I had to go!

177
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,719
You should wait till we find the washroom!

178
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,319
Nick, give me a hand!

179
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:14,983
Coming Sir!

180
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,294
That's it... that's it.

181
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,202
Easy!

182
00:20:38,053 --> 00:20:39,096
Hang on.

183
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,723
Hang on!

184
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,650
Trevor!

185
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:54,781
Nick!

186
00:20:54,945 --> 00:20:56,238
The Captain!

187
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,720
Nick! Come in here!

188
00:21:10,628 --> 00:21:11,885
Damn your ladder!

189
00:21:19,261 --> 00:21:21,101
We've got to get the rope around him.

190
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:26,852
Hold him there!

191
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,656
I'll pull him from above.

192
00:22:44,221 --> 00:22:45,894
Okay Sir... I've got you.

193
00:22:54,982 --> 00:22:56,655
- Is he okay?
- Yes Sir.

194
00:22:58,694 --> 00:22:59,987
There must be someone on watch.

195
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,572
- See if you can find 'em.
- Yes Sir.

196
00:23:04,492 --> 00:23:05,535
Give me a hand!

197
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,707
Let's sit him here.

198
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:14,127
Here, let me.

199
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,503
Are you alright?

200
00:23:15,544 --> 00:23:16,587
I'm fine.

201
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:05,469
It's not so bad...

202
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,894
...we're out of the water...

203
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:09,855
...and it's a nice day, huh?

204
00:24:10,057 --> 00:24:11,315
We could clear this mess up...

205
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:13,361
...play a little shuffleboard, get a tan...

206
00:24:13,894 --> 00:24:15,567
...we'll have a nice trip. Whaddaya say?

207
00:24:17,731 --> 00:24:18,942
What's going on!

208
00:24:20,484 --> 00:24:21,409
Oh my God... Jackie!

209
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:22,570
Get me down! Please!

210
00:24:23,112 --> 00:24:24,951
For God's sake, can you get me down!

211
00:24:25,448 --> 00:24:26,740
Jackie, grab my hand!

212
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:28,919
I feel so stupid up here!

213
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:30,328
You can grab my arm!

214
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:31,579
Grab it!

215
00:24:31,787 --> 00:24:32,998
What's the matter with you?!

216
00:24:33,414 --> 00:24:34,457
Oh Jesus... Jesus!

217
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:36,333
Grab me!

218
00:24:37,168 --> 00:24:38,461
Grab my hand!

219
00:24:38,627 --> 00:24:39,719
Grab him! Come on!

220
00:24:43,174 --> 00:24:44,597
It's swinging me out!

221
00:24:44,925 --> 00:24:46,183
It's swinging me out!

222
00:24:46,927 --> 00:24:48,220
Don't let me drop!

223
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:51,192
Hey... don't let me drop!

224
00:24:51,432 --> 00:24:52,475
Get me back!

225
00:24:53,434 --> 00:24:54,477
Get me back!

226
00:24:56,479 --> 00:24:57,866
Get me back!

227
00:24:59,774 --> 00:25:00,948
I'm going up!

228
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:03,402
Help me!

229
00:25:03,652 --> 00:25:04,695
Please!

230
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:25,973
Jackie, your hand!

231
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:08,102
No Trevor, don't!

232
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,474
The propellers!

233
00:26:09,718 --> 00:26:10,761
He's drowning!

234
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:11,846
He's drowning!

235
00:27:15,201 --> 00:27:17,787
Come on darling, it's alright.
It's alright.

236
00:27:17,995 --> 00:27:18,838
Up you go.

237
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:20,959
Come on... let's see what's in here.

238
00:28:22,768 --> 00:28:24,191
Ben... is that you?

239
00:28:24,437 --> 00:28:25,479
Yes Dad!

240
00:28:30,818 --> 00:28:31,910
Come on.

241
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:34,535
- Are you alright?
- Yes.

242
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,443
Dammit.

243
00:29:13,068 --> 00:29:15,619
What do we do now?
Do we just go on?

244
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,407
Be careful.

245
00:29:18,157 --> 00:29:19,201
Watch your heads.

246
00:29:33,714 --> 00:29:35,268
<i>Herr Ashland...</i>

247
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:40,145
<i>Kapitän Ashland...
können Sie Mich hören, Kapitän?</i>

248
00:29:42,598 --> 00:29:45,528
<i>Dieses Schiff hat auf Sie gewartet.</i>

249
00:29:47,228 --> 00:29:50,858
<i>Es ist Ihr neues Schiff, Kapitän.</i>

250
00:29:51,357 --> 00:29:52,994
<i>Können Sie Mich hören, Ashland?</i>

251
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:56,498
<i>Ashland...</i>

252
00:29:57,363 --> 00:29:59,166
<i>...es ist lhre Chance...</i>

253
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:01,705
<i>...worauf warten Sie noch?</i>

254
00:30:02,284 --> 00:30:05,049
<i>Ein neues Schiff...
Ein neues Kommand.</i>

255
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:07,623
<i>Ashland...</i>

256
00:30:12,586 --> 00:30:13,629
<i>...jetzt!</i>

257
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,809
<i>...Ihre Chance ist gekommen.</i>

258
00:30:57,798 --> 00:31:01,346
This old ship...
seems to have a life of it's own.

259
00:31:03,471 --> 00:31:04,764
Let's keep moving.

260
00:31:04,889 --> 00:31:06,609
Mummy, I'm frightened!

261
00:31:30,706 --> 00:31:33,257
Oh come on Robin, it's alright.

262
00:31:33,417 --> 00:31:35,588
Robin. Come on sweetie.

263
00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:38,297
Come on honey. Nothing can happen
as long as we're all together.

264
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:39,882
Come on.

265
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:42,601
It smells a bit funny in here.

266
00:31:48,015 --> 00:31:49,308
I wonder where the crew are?

267
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,610
Wherever they are, they certainly
don't care about this ship.

268
00:31:53,729 --> 00:31:55,781
What nationality can they be?

269
00:31:56,107 --> 00:31:57,198
How about German?

270
00:31:57,441 --> 00:31:58,699
- German?
- Yeah, look at this.

271
00:32:00,194 --> 00:32:04,666
It says... er... "Please replace games
where you found them", I think.

272
00:32:04,949 --> 00:32:05,991
It's German.

273
00:32:06,534 --> 00:32:07,576
I'm thirsty!

274
00:32:07,701 --> 00:32:08,744
Me too!

275
00:32:09,537 --> 00:32:12,751
Come on, let's see if we can find
the galley and get some water, hmm?

276
00:32:13,082 --> 00:32:14,505
Come on Robin, get up.

277
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:20,718
Listen, I'm going to try and find
some clothes for everyone - okay?

278
00:32:27,054 --> 00:32:28,644
I could use some help with Ashland.

279
00:32:28,848 --> 00:32:30,520
Well I... I'll try and help you.

280
00:32:37,606 --> 00:32:38,649
This it it, mum.

281
00:32:41,485 --> 00:32:44,867
Right Robin, you start over there,
and Ben and I will start over here.

282
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:08,481
Robin, now be careful
and don't eat anything.

283
00:33:25,654 --> 00:33:29,166
No no darling! Don't drink that!
No, not until we boil it, right?

284
00:33:29,325 --> 00:33:30,997
That's it, there's a good boy.

285
00:34:15,496 --> 00:34:16,588
Anybody there?

286
00:35:25,941 --> 00:35:27,662
The steam comes up here
and runs down there.

287
00:35:27,735 --> 00:35:29,206
That's called condensation.

288
00:35:29,612 --> 00:35:30,739
That's right Robin.

289
00:35:30,988 --> 00:35:32,031
We learned it at school.

290
00:35:32,281 --> 00:35:35,211
Just proves that not everything
you learn in school is useless, hmm?

291
00:36:38,848 --> 00:36:39,975
Oh look!

292
00:36:49,275 --> 00:36:50,901
Darling, there's some water over there.

293
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,367
Oh, thanks.

294
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:57,831
Has anyone seen Nick?

295
00:36:58,742 --> 00:36:59,785
No.

296
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,843
Hello.

297
00:37:17,928 --> 00:37:19,020
Hello! Hello!

298
00:37:20,097 --> 00:37:20,643
Hello!

299
00:37:21,056 --> 00:37:22,480
Who's there?

300
00:37:25,478 --> 00:37:26,520
Hello!

301
00:37:33,277 --> 00:37:34,535
Probably Nick?

302
00:37:34,945 --> 00:37:35,988
Probably.

303
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,142
<i>Ashland...</i>

304
00:37:53,464 --> 00:37:55,516
<i>...können Sie Mich hören, Kapitän?</i>

305
00:37:57,676 --> 00:38:00,357
<i>Sie sind hier endlich in Sicherheit.</i>

306
00:38:02,056 --> 00:38:03,609
<i>Ich erwarte Sie auf der Brücke.</i>

307
00:38:05,101 --> 00:38:06,143
<i>Sofort!</i>

308
00:38:08,187 --> 00:38:09,741
<i>Kommen Sie zur Brücke!</i>

309
00:38:39,552 --> 00:38:41,224
These old ships'll row on anything.

310
00:38:41,887 --> 00:38:43,014
Even wet blotting paper.

311
00:38:50,688 --> 00:38:51,730
Nick!

312
00:38:54,567 --> 00:38:55,777
Nick, can you hear me?

313
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,205
Coming!

314
00:39:04,201 --> 00:39:05,244
Nick!

315
00:39:09,248 --> 00:39:11,585
This door was locked.
What the hell's going on here?

316
00:39:11,709 --> 00:39:12,503
Did you find anyone?

317
00:39:12,668 --> 00:39:13,712
No. There's nobody on board.

318
00:39:13,836 --> 00:39:15,129
Well, where are they?

319
00:39:16,005 --> 00:39:16,717
C'mon Nick.

320
00:39:16,881 --> 00:39:18,304
Don't let this door shut!

321
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:19,967
What happened to you?

322
00:39:37,999 --> 00:39:40,335
What is it with this ship?
It's like it's running itself.

323
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,136
Take me to the chart room.

324
00:39:47,467 --> 00:39:52,640
<i>Kapitän Ashland, Sie gehören zum Schiff.
Sie müssen es sofort führen.</i>

325
00:39:54,724 --> 00:39:56,361
<i>Sofort!</i>

326
00:39:58,395 --> 00:40:00,067
I've gotta get to the bridge.

327
00:40:01,606 --> 00:40:03,077
No Captain Ashland, No.

328
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,621
What... ship is this?

329
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,787
I don't know Captain Ashland.
No-one knows.

330
00:40:09,197 --> 00:40:13,040
Captain Asland. No...
No, you... must lay down.

331
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,703
Rest.

332
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:16,746
Rest!

333
00:40:18,164 --> 00:40:19,207
Rest.

334
00:40:21,543 --> 00:40:22,585
That's odd.

335
00:40:23,586 --> 00:40:24,630
The course marked on this chart...

336
00:40:24,754 --> 00:40:26,756
...just goes around the Atlantic
in huge circles.

337
00:40:31,177 --> 00:40:32,565
Captain, take a look at this.

338
00:40:42,313 --> 00:40:45,031
This equipment must be
over forty years old.

339
00:40:51,364 --> 00:40:53,369
We can't use this junk
to send out a signal.

340
00:40:54,993 --> 00:40:56,703
Let's hope our first message got through.

341
00:41:01,499 --> 00:41:02,591
Look at this!

342
00:41:03,418 --> 00:41:04,889
This one's about Hitler.

343
00:41:05,253 --> 00:41:05,930
Who is he?

344
00:41:06,254 --> 00:41:08,971
A rather unpleasant man,
he started World War Two.

345
00:41:09,382 --> 00:41:10,723
Is this Hitler?

346
00:41:11,718 --> 00:41:12,761
Not quite...

347
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,095
The King of England.

348
00:41:21,478 --> 00:41:23,565

353
00:41:38,244 --> 00:41:40,047
Listen. There's that music again.

354
00:41:40,455 --> 00:41:41,048
He's wrong.

355
00:41:41,122 --> 00:41:42,415
There is someone else on board.

356
00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:44,376
Let's take a look.

357
00:41:44,459 --> 00:41:45,218
Come on Ben.

358
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:46,551
Let's stay together.

359
00:42:03,937 --> 00:42:05,574
This is incredible.

360
00:42:06,314 --> 00:42:08,651
What the hell are those
engines using for fuel?

361
00:42:14,614 --> 00:42:16,500
All these gauges read zero.

362
00:42:16,991 --> 00:42:18,332
Come on, let's get outta here.

363
00:42:18,535 --> 00:42:19,578
Lead the way!

364
00:42:21,037 --> 00:42:22,591
We've gotta get off this ship!

365
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:23,958
The lifeboats!

366
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:36,018
That's odd. I'm sure it was coming
from this direction.

367
00:42:37,303 --> 00:42:39,474
- Not in there.
- Maybe it's in the next room.

368
00:42:41,057 --> 00:42:42,611
It's a movie house.

369
00:42:43,017 --> 00:42:44,820
Movie house? It can't be.

370
00:42:45,895 --> 00:42:48,066
Can we run the film mummy? Can we?

371
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,203
I don't know.

372
00:42:50,692 --> 00:42:51,735
Let's see.

373
00:42:57,991 --> 00:42:59,034
It works!

374
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:14,265
<i>♪ I know a perfect recipe... ♪</i>

375

378
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:15,635
Mrs Morgan...

379
00:45:18,214 --> 00:45:19,257
Mrs Morgan...

380
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,473
- What? What is it?
- It's a movie.

381
00:45:22,802 --> 00:45:24,095
- Come quick!
- A movie?

382
00:45:52,665 --> 00:45:54,421
It should work, It looks well greased.

383
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,797
Let's go below, get cleaned up,
and get the others...

384
00:45:59,005 --> 00:46:00,476
...and get off this ship.

385
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:18,821
Stop moaning and put the lights on.

386
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:19,943
I'll get it.

387
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,216
What's happening to... to me?

388
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:34,457
Mrs Morgan!

389
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:41,721
Don't touch her mummy!
She's poisonous!

390
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:49,440
Robin! Come back! Robin!

391
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:24,716
Help me.

392
00:47:25,091 --> 00:47:25,850
Help...

393
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:27,771
<i>Töten Sie, Ashland...</i>

394
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,804
<i>...das ist das richtige!</i>

395
00:47:33,516 --> 00:47:35,023
<i>Töten Sie, Ashland...</i>

396
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:36,819
<i>...worauf warten Sie?</i>

397
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,157
<i>Es tut nicht weh.</i>

398
00:47:48,823 --> 00:47:49,748
What happened to you?

399
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:52,998
Daddy, daddy, I'm real frightened.
Can we all get off this ship please.

400
00:47:54,829 --> 00:47:56,301
Thank God.

401
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:57,583
It's Mrs Morgan.

402
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:01,003
Stay with them Nick.

403
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:02,379
Oh Nick.

404
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:22,982
She's dead.

405
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:28,458
Of a seizure. It was quite quick.

406
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:31,452
At least she won't be in pain any more.

407
00:48:32,742 --> 00:48:35,875
I suggest you assemble everyone
for a burial at sea.

408
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:49,515
We are gathered here to
pay our last respects...

409
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,896
...to a wonderful woman...

410
00:48:53,012 --> 00:48:55,397
...that sadly, we knew
for such a short time.

411
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:57,894
Those are quite the wrong words,
Marshall.

412
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:01,072
Perhaps you will allow me?

413
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:17,043
Let us pray...

414
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:19,873
...for the soul of our
dearly departed sister.

415
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:22,421
O God, whose mercies cannot be numbered.

416
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:26,264
Accept our prayers on behalf
of our servant departed...

417
00:49:26,504 --> 00:49:29,138
...and grant her entrance into
the halls of light and joy...

418
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:33,309
...in the fellowship of thy saints
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

419
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:35,055
Amen.

420
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:36,181
Amen.

421
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:38,395
Almighty God, we commend her spirit...

422
00:49:38,516 --> 00:49:40,185
...and we commit her body to the deep...

423
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:42,687
...in the sure hope of the
resurrection and eternal life...

424
00:49:42,937 --> 00:49:44,943
...through our Lord Jesus Christ.
Amen.

425
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:17,432
The boats!

426
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,932
The boats are our last chance!

427
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:20,183
Damn it I know it!

428
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:27,357
Quick, the other boat.

429
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:58,148
They're floating away, Dad!

430
00:50:58,263 --> 00:50:59,686
This damned ship!

431
00:50:59,889 --> 00:51:01,776
It's like it's alive,
trying to kill us!

432
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,281
Marshall!

433
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:56,074
Can you step up to the Bridge please.

434
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:17,594
Would you care to inspect the Wheel House?

435
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:39,411
Charts, sextant, log book.

436
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:43,034
Daily sailing orders.

437
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:46,422
Main steering gear.

438
00:52:48,289 --> 00:52:50,129
How do you like my chair, Marshall?

439
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,219
Ideal for long trips.

440
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:58,555
Did you say "your" chair?

441
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:01,896
Yes.
You'll get one when you are a Captain.

442
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:07,064
In the meantime, this is my ship,
and I am the Captain.

443
00:53:11,312 --> 00:53:13,318
Would you like to steer her?

444
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:17,323
All of my previous passengers
liked to do that.

445
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:19,537
They liked to pretend to be a Captain.

446
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:21,156
Like you.

447
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:24,372
But it's no so easy.

448
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:26,494
Try it.

449
00:53:47,932 --> 00:53:50,151
You took my last ship from me.

450
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:51,864
You won't get this one.

451
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,742
I didn't take your ship from you.

452
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:57,870
The company took it from you.

453
00:53:58,818 --> 00:53:59,992
And you know why?

454
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:01,874
Because you can't deal with people.

455
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:04,157
You don't know how to handle
a crew or passengers.

456
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:06,212
Maybe so Marshall.

457
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:09,420
But I know how to handle ships.

458
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:21,342
Engine room!

459
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,313
Full ahead!

460
00:54:31,267 --> 00:54:35,858
A captain never leaves his post,
even a pretend captain like you, Marshall.

461
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:39,490
Ashland, you're sick.

462
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:41,993
I'm taking command of this ship.

463
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:44,455
You can't.

464
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:49,622
No one can take this ship away from me!

465
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:02,679
Where do you plan to sail her?

466
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,223
Eternity, Marshall.

467
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:08,472
Eternity.

468
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:19,066
Come on Robin.
I want you to try and get some rest.

469
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:20,620
I can't. I'm too scared.

470
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:23,575
Oh shhh... there's nothing we can do
until tomorrow morning.

471
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,703
Why? Why do we have to wait?
I wanna go now.

472
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:28,336
Quiet. You'll wake Ben.

473
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:31,167
Now listen to me.

474
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:33,664
I want to get off this ship
as much as you do, but...

475
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:38,712
...we've got to wait until it's light so
we can all see what we're doing.

476
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:41,927
Daddy thinks it's best that
we stay right where we are.

477
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:45,768
We're warm, and dry and...

478
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:49,268
...we've got something to eat, and...
well...

479
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:52,016
Understand?

480
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:01,442
What is it?

481
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:03,323
Ashland's totally schizophrenic.

482
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,822
He's taken on the role
of a German naval officer.

483
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:09,578
It's as if this ship has somehow
taken possession of him.

484
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:11,034
Where is he now?

485
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:12,499
I left him in the Wheel House.

486
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,211
- Ben's sleeping?
- Yes, yes.

487
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:28,093
We'll lock ourselves in for the night,
til we figure a way to get off this ship.

488
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:30,387
C'mon.

489
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:48,013
Robin.

490
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:50,926
Robin?

491
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,143
What now?

492
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:56,390
I gotta go.

493
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:59,315
You can't, not now.
Hold it til morning.

494
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:00,685
I can't.

495
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,865
Come with me Robbie. Please.

496
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:09,779
Alright...

497
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,781
Men!

498
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:36,055
Where is it?

499
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:38,142
I don't know, but we'll find it.

500
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:43,692
No Ben.

501
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:45,901
But it's getting desperate!

502
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,227
Hurry up, Ben!

503
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,936
Okay! I'm ready.

504
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:25,988
Lori, I love you.

505
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:30,233
Do you?

506
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:33,611
Do you?

507
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:37,252
If you had asked me a week ago,
I'd have said no.

508
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:42,003
Now, maybe.

509
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:47,585
Come on. Let's take a shower.

510
01:00:14,734 --> 01:00:15,778
I'm scared.

511
01:00:15,985 --> 01:00:18,370
You're scared? I'm scared shirtless!

512
01:00:18,613 --> 01:00:20,700
It's shitless... oops!

513
01:00:20,948 --> 01:00:23,417
Never mind. I'm just trying to be polite.

514
01:00:23,576 --> 01:00:26,625
- I know lots of other words like...
- Okay wise guy.

515
01:00:26,788 --> 01:00:28,175
I think...

516
01:00:28,915 --> 01:00:29,840
...we...

517
01:00:29,957 --> 01:00:31,429
...we should go down there.

518
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:34,300
- You sure?
- Think so.

519
01:00:34,587 --> 01:00:36,260
You go first then.

520
01:00:36,422 --> 01:00:38,807
- You're smallest, you go.
- No, you.

521
01:00:38,925 --> 01:00:40,894
Men first, Ladies last.

522
01:00:41,177 --> 01:00:44,025
- Since when?
- Since now. Go on!

523
01:00:46,224 --> 01:00:47,896
What ya whistling for?

524
01:00:48,601 --> 01:00:50,653
If we get lost, we can hear each other.

525
01:00:51,062 --> 01:00:52,901
- That's stupid.
- No it isn't.

526
01:00:57,694 --> 01:00:58,986
Ben?

527
01:01:01,572 --> 01:01:02,664
Ben!

528
01:01:17,922 --> 01:01:20,259
Nick, open the door.

529
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:25,055
Hang on a minute. Looks like it's stuck.

530
01:01:30,059 --> 01:01:33,156
Nick... this is blood!

531
01:01:33,563 --> 01:01:35,116
It's blood!

532
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,030
Hold on... just hold on!

533
01:01:40,445 --> 01:01:41,951
Hold on, Lori! Hold on!

534
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:47,879
Somebody help me!

535
01:01:48,661 --> 01:01:51,046
Help me! Help me!

536
01:01:56,919 --> 01:01:58,889
Ben, are you down there?

537
01:02:12,727 --> 01:02:15,740
Let me out of here please!

538
01:02:22,028 --> 01:02:23,998
Ben, I'm coming down!

539
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:35,177
Get me out of here! Get me out of here!

540
01:02:38,503 --> 01:02:39,760
Help me!

541
01:02:40,254 --> 01:02:41,346
Lori!

542
01:02:42,173 --> 01:02:43,845
Lori! Don't give up!

543
01:03:02,819 --> 01:03:04,409
<i>Holt Eure Maschinengewehre.</i>

544
01:03:04,696 --> 01:03:06,036
<i>Munition nicht vergessen.</i>

545
01:03:06,155 --> 01:03:07,828
<i>Schnell, Schnell...
den Patronengürtel!</i>

546
01:03:08,491 --> 01:03:10,578
<i>Alles fertig? Ja!</i>

547
01:04:37,372 --> 01:04:38,546
Robin!

548
01:04:39,332 --> 01:04:40,459
Ben!

549
01:04:41,376 --> 01:04:42,716
Where are you?

550
01:04:44,045 --> 01:04:45,255
Ben!

551
01:04:46,506 --> 01:04:47,597
Robin!

552
01:04:48,174 --> 01:04:49,348
Answer me!

553
01:05:05,674 --> 01:05:07,265
Let me help you.

554
01:05:31,575 --> 01:05:32,833
Daddy!

555
01:05:50,928 --> 01:05:55,021
C'mon. Let's go find mum. C'mon.

556
01:06:09,947 --> 01:06:10,991
It's Lori.

557
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:12,451
Stay here, all of you.

558
01:06:19,290 --> 01:06:21,342
Shh... try and get some sleep.

559
01:06:55,451 --> 01:07:01,833
And to our mighty God, we commend her soul,
and we commit her body to the deep!

560
01:07:02,124 --> 01:07:03,298
No!

561
01:07:06,170 --> 01:07:09,219
Ashland you crazy bastard!

562
01:07:09,298 --> 01:07:11,766
We've gotta stop him before
he gets to someone else!

563
01:07:40,037 --> 01:07:41,544
This way!

564
01:09:58,259 --> 01:10:00,430
My God!

565
01:10:09,603 --> 01:10:12,237
What the hell are these?

566
01:10:12,898 --> 01:10:14,868
Gold teeth.

567
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:20,702
This must have been used
as an interrogation ship.

568
01:10:31,292 --> 01:10:33,297
It's still running.

569
01:11:24,970 --> 01:11:27,391
Come on, let's get the hell out of here!
Come on!

570
01:12:20,401 --> 01:12:22,655
Stop it!

571
01:12:38,335 --> 01:12:41,550
For God's sake! Stop It!

572
01:14:51,552 --> 01:14:53,557
This ship needs blood, Marshall...

573
01:14:54,013 --> 01:14:55,057
...needs blood...

574
01:14:55,514 --> 01:14:56,688
...it must have blood...

575
01:14:57,057 --> 01:14:58,185
...must have blood...

576
01:14:58,601 --> 01:15:00,154
...blood to survive...

577
01:15:00,728 --> 01:15:01,570
...blood...

578
01:15:01,687 --> 01:15:02,730
...your blood...

579
01:15:02,813 --> 01:15:04,653
...and the blood of your wife...

580
01:15:04,899 --> 01:15:06,405
...blood of your wife...

581
01:15:06,650 --> 01:15:08,157
...the blood of your children...

582
01:15:08,527 --> 01:15:09,915
...blood of your children...

583
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:11,281
...blood of your children...

584
01:15:11,405 --> 01:15:12,330
...your wife...

585
01:15:12,448 --> 01:15:17,087
...wife... children... children...
children... blood, Marshall...

586
01:15:17,495 --> 01:15:19,621
...must have blood...
this ship needs blood, Marshall...

587
01:15:19,622 --> 01:15:22,671
...must have blood...
this ship needs blood, Marshall...

588
01:16:00,287 --> 01:16:01,379
What's happening?

589
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:03,835
I don't know what's happening.
But we've got to get off this ship!

590
01:16:03,999 --> 01:16:05,471
But there aren't any boats!

591
01:16:05,543 --> 01:16:07,753
There may be something
we can use in the ship's store.

592
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:30,609
Keep them back...

593
01:16:31,944 --> 01:16:33,036
Margaret, keep them back!

594
01:16:56,552 --> 01:16:58,142
What is it mummy? What's in there?

595
01:16:58,345 --> 01:16:59,388
It's...

596
01:16:59,472 --> 01:17:02,105
It's... it's not... not for you.
Just stay there!

597
01:17:47,728 --> 01:17:48,820
Margaret...

598
01:17:49,563 --> 01:17:50,987
...put these on the kids.

599
01:17:51,941 --> 01:17:53,484
What are you going back in there for?

600
01:17:54,485 --> 01:17:56,237
There's something else in here we can use.

601
01:18:17,466 --> 01:18:19,103
- Come on!
- I'll help you daddy!

602
01:18:19,343 --> 01:18:20,684
- Attaboy, Ben. Grab the other end.
- Robin, you take this.

603
01:18:20,803 --> 01:18:21,846
Pick it up!

604
01:18:23,973 --> 01:18:24,518
Up you come.

605
01:18:24,807 --> 01:18:25,850
That's it.

606
01:18:25,975 --> 01:18:27,017
Come on.

607
01:18:27,184 --> 01:18:28,311
Hurry up! Hurry up!

608
01:18:30,146 --> 01:18:31,320
We've got to stop this ship.

609
01:18:48,721 --> 01:18:50,726
Keep this life jacket on all the time.

610
01:18:51,974 --> 01:18:53,185
Now, do you hear me Robin?

611
01:18:53,309 --> 01:18:54,351
Yes, mummy.

612
01:18:58,022 --> 01:18:59,065
Get down!

613
01:19:07,198 --> 01:19:09,369
No-one leaves my ship, Marshall!

614
01:19:12,536 --> 01:19:13,579
No-one!

615
01:19:28,052 --> 01:19:29,095
Come on, Ben!

616
01:19:30,596 --> 01:19:31,639
Come on!

617
01:19:32,348 --> 01:19:33,391
Go!

618
01:19:40,189 --> 01:19:41,232
Run!

619
01:19:44,735 --> 01:19:45,778
Stay down!

620
01:19:49,073 --> 01:19:50,627
Go to the children, quick!

621
01:20:13,472 --> 01:20:15,275
Hurry, children, hurry!

622
01:20:35,870 --> 01:20:37,507
That's right Robin, push!

623
01:20:38,914 --> 01:20:39,957
Go, Ben!

624
01:20:42,877 --> 01:20:44,218
Alright Robin, get ready!

625
01:20:46,714 --> 01:20:47,757
Go!

626
01:20:51,385 --> 01:20:52,726
Swim for the raft!

627
01:20:54,847 --> 01:20:56,769
No-one leaves my ship!

628
01:21:01,979 --> 01:21:03,486
Trevor!

629
01:21:13,449 --> 01:21:14,492
No!

630
01:21:15,034 --> 01:21:15,461
No!

631
01:21:15,743 --> 01:21:18,211
Get in there, you bitch!

632
01:21:34,095 --> 01:21:38,318
<i>- Achtung Achtung! Feind in Sicht.
- Alles in Stellung.</i>

633
01:21:38,599 --> 01:21:40,687
<i>Achtung Achtung! Alle Mann an Deck.</i>

634
01:22:20,975 --> 01:22:22,268
Trevor!

635
01:22:22,351 --> 01:22:24,190
Trevor!

636
01:22:36,699 --> 01:22:38,918
Ben... Robin... where's mum?

637
01:22:39,035 --> 01:22:40,707
She's still on the ship!

638
01:22:41,287 --> 01:22:42,331
Trevor!

639
01:22:50,963 --> 01:22:53,217
Alright... Margaret...

640
01:22:58,721 --> 01:22:59,895
Alright...

641
01:23:00,097 --> 01:23:01,140
Yes!

642
01:23:20,951 --> 01:23:22,209
Hard to port!

643
01:23:28,584 --> 01:23:31,966
You bastards! When I give an order
I expect it to be obeyed!

644
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,470
Do you hear me?!

645
01:23:34,673 --> 01:23:37,717
<i>Verfolgen Sie eine 30
Grad Steuerbordwendung.</i>

646
01:23:37,718 --> 01:23:41,182
<i>Voraussichtliche Berührung mit
Feind um 21.00 Uhr.</i>

647
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:53,990
I am your Captain!

648
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:58,621
I command you to alter course!

649
01:24:05,037 --> 01:24:06,460
Ben... give me that.

650
01:24:06,997 --> 01:24:08,125
Sit over here.

651
01:24:44,577 --> 01:24:50,461
<i>Kurs und Position ein. 190 Grad
Steuer voraus. Volle Kraft voraus...</i>

652
01:25:31,248 --> 01:25:32,376
It's going the other way.

653
01:25:33,584 --> 01:25:34,627
We made it!

654
01:25:37,129 --> 01:25:38,683
We'll be alright now.

655
01:25:41,384 --> 01:25:42,426
Keep paddling!

656
01:25:44,970 --> 01:25:46,013
That's it.

657
01:25:51,435 --> 01:25:54,449
Roger, base. We'll make just one
more sweep then we're headed home.

658
01:26:00,861 --> 01:26:01,455
Hold it!

659
01:26:01,862 --> 01:26:03,250
I think we've got something here.

660
01:26:03,989 --> 01:26:08,498
Yeah! We have a raft.
One, two, three, four... Yeah, four people.

661
01:26:08,911 --> 01:26:10,418
No sign of any further survivors.

662
01:26:12,081 --> 01:26:14,335
Hello! Hey! Hello!

663
01:26:14,625 --> 01:26:16,168
They seem to be in pretty good shape.

664
01:26:17,253 --> 01:26:18,759
Heading in to execute rescue.

665
01:26:20,423 --> 01:26:25,263
We're safe, Margaret. We're safe.
Robin... we're alright!
