Oh, shit.
You really are fucking useless, aren't you?

You really are fucking useless, aren't you?
Useless?

Aren't you? Useless?
You show me someone who can rig

Motion-Sensored, face-Recognition cameras.
Face-Recognition cameras?

Face-Recognition cameras. Face-Recognition
cameras? How'd you get this, though, on

Face-Recognition cameras?
How'd you get this, though, on our budget?

How'd you get this, though, on our budget?
I know a guy who specializes

I know a guy who specializes in them.
How do you know a guy who

422
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,640
In them. How do you know a guy who
specializes in cacti equipment?

How do you know a guy who specializes

Walkies. Give me that camera back.
And it's three words, penis.

Do you think this hairstyle makes me
look fat? [ FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ]

Go on, then. Tell them. Tell us what?
Dickwad here has forgotten

Tell us what? Dickwad here has
forgotten the walkie-talkies.

Dickwad here has forgotten the
walkie-Talkies. Oh, and the torches.

00:20:58,024 --> 00:20:59,390
The walkie-Talkies. Oh, and the torches.
Why don't we use our cameras

442
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:00,958
Oh, and the torches. Why don't we use our
cameras for light and call each other on

443
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,527
Why don't we use our cameras for light
and call each other on our phones?

444
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:10,529
What the... My battery's dead.

445
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,039
My battery's dead.
Jason? Mine, too.

Mine, too. I don't understand.
It was fully charged this

I don't understand.
It was fully charged this morning.

449

It was fully charged this morning.
It'll be the spirits.

Morning. It'll be the spirits.
They can do that... Draw on the

It'll be the spirits. They can do that...
Draw on the powers to feed their own.

452
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:26,784
They can do that... Draw on the powers to
feed their own. We must be dealing with

453
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,719
Powers to feed their own. We must be dealing
with something very strong if they've

454
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:30,288
We must be dealing with something very strong
if they've already taken all the power.

455
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,023
Something very strong if they've already taken
all the power. Makes you wonder what they'll

00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:33,291
Already taken all the power.
Makes you wonder what they'll take next.

You know, theatrics?

530
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:18,055
Little drama. You know, theatrics?
Something to stop them from

531

You know, theatrics? Something to stop
them from clicking the "stop" button and

532

Something to stop them from clicking the

get on television, I need to shine, and

542
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,609
And if I'm ever gonna get on television, I
need to shine, and so do the people around me.
