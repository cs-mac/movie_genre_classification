1
00:01:20,003 --> 00:01:21,804
<i>This way!</i>

2
00:01:38,748 --> 00:01:40,982
- <i>There!</i>
- <i>Where?</i>

3
00:01:41,972 --> 00:01:43,320
<i>Next to the further beech tree!</i>

4
00:02:00,826 --> 00:02:01,478
<i>Get Down.</i>

5
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:44,746
THE RED BARON

6
00:08:44,411 --> 00:08:46,650
Are you out of your bloody mind?

7
00:08:47,106 --> 00:08:48,184
Yes, sir.

8
00:08:48,623 --> 00:08:52,661
You risk the squadron planes to
attend an enemy funeral?

9
00:08:52,662 --> 00:08:54,012
Yes, sir!

10
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:58,531
Lehmann and Sternberg knew him, sir,
Captain Winston Clyde Walker.

11
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,012
The chap in the coffin I meant, sir.

12
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,818
Yes! I mean, sir...

13
00:09:04,513 --> 00:09:07,467
My uncle, the Duke of Westchester
is his mother's brother-in-law.

14
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:11,253
Lehmann and I, we went to school
with him. Eton, sir.

15
00:09:11,512 --> 00:09:14,011
You're talking about a British pilot,
for heaven sake.

16
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:15,911
One of the best in the
Royal Flying Corp.

17
00:09:16,282 --> 00:09:18,239
It's a pity that he's not with
us anymore, sir.

18
00:09:20,745 --> 00:09:22,179
Oh, what the hell!

19
00:09:23,238 --> 00:09:24,200
Dismissed!

20
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,272
I've heard you got yourself
some holes,

21
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,403
while paying your condolences,
Richthofen.

22
00:09:37,084 --> 00:09:39,475
Ah, I love these small gossipy
airfields, Kielmeyer.

23
00:09:39,476 --> 00:09:42,396
- Anyone wants a cigarette?
- French?

24
00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:47,785
- <i>De rien.</i>
- <i>Merci.</i>

25
00:09:47,989 --> 00:09:49,728
Richthofen brought down a two-seater.

26
00:09:53,284 --> 00:09:55,980
I supposed that's to make up for
ignoring my orders.

27
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,350
No...

28
00:09:57,351 --> 00:09:58,945
Just adding to my score.

29
00:10:03,724 --> 00:10:06,252
I have just got a report,
a British RE8

30
00:10:06,253 --> 00:10:07,802
crashed 12 km from here.

31
00:10:08,461 --> 00:10:09,983
My utmost respect, Baron.

32
00:10:11,091 --> 00:10:15,223
Let's go find your plane, let's get
your kill confirm, you bastards.

33
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:44,457
Help me, come on... Help me!

34
00:10:46,656 --> 00:10:48,038
Careful... Alright.

35
00:10:48,506 --> 00:10:49,038
One,

36
00:10:49,771 --> 00:10:51,600
two, three...

37
00:10:52,591 --> 00:10:54,443
I said careful...

38
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:13,771
Hurry up... He's bloody heavy.

39
00:11:17,012 --> 00:11:18,292
He's losing a lot of blood.

40
00:11:20,176 --> 00:11:21,435
Take these off.

41
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:26,371
You'll be alright, you'll be alright!

42
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:30,022
You can take him.

43
00:11:32,163 --> 00:11:33,576
Pick him up!

44
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,855
Thank you!

45
00:11:40,856 --> 00:11:42,776
You saved this man life.

46
00:11:42,777 --> 00:11:43,805
No.

47
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:45,563
I shot him down.

48
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:07,937
You're down, Sternberg.

49
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:12,608
Oh no. You attacked single seater
DH2 from above towards the...

50
00:12:12,609 --> 00:12:14,985
Listen Sterni, if the attacker
has a rotary engine then....

51
00:12:14,986 --> 00:12:16,861
What is a rotary engine?

52
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:25,722
Oh Lieutenant Sternberg...

53
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,356
Oh... Hello!

54
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,026
Hey...

55
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:34,378
Well obviously she prefers
men like me, Voss!

56
00:12:34,466 --> 00:12:36,310
Men like who?

57
00:12:37,761 --> 00:12:41,483
- Moses, Freud...
- Better get
ourselves circumcised, Voss.

58
00:12:44,117 --> 00:12:44,817
Good evening!

59
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:47,629
- <i>Bonjour lieutenant.</i>
- <i>Hello, Monique.</i>

60
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,908
Hey, not so fast.

61
00:12:50,207 --> 00:12:52,990
Hey Manfred... Look,
she looks like your little nurse...

62
00:12:53,224 --> 00:12:54,859
...at least from behind.

63
00:12:55,231 --> 00:12:56,941
<i>My little... Voss.</i>

64
00:12:57,808 --> 00:12:58,808
Oh la la!

65
00:12:59,313 --> 00:13:00,663
I'm sorry, sir.

66
00:13:00,664 --> 00:13:03,530
What are you doing here?

67
00:13:05,246 --> 00:13:07,042
Have a seat, have a drink on us.

68
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,586
I thought you chaps just
wanted to have some cocktails.

69
00:13:13,588 --> 00:13:15,492
Sit down and have a drink with us.

70
00:13:17,873 --> 00:13:18,373
Here!

71
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,309
I'm married you know...

72
00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:29,589
So am I!

73
00:13:30,046 --> 00:13:33,244
I mean, almost... at least.

74
00:13:36,409 --> 00:13:38,062
<i>...We need a bucket of water.</i>

75
00:13:48,603 --> 00:13:50,751
<i>The driver says the engine
is overheated.</i>

76
00:14:15,783 --> 00:14:18,225
- Lieutenant.
- The name is von Richthofen.

77
00:14:19,053 --> 00:14:21,029
Pleased to meet you again,
<i>Mademoiselle.</i>

78
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,371
- I know your name.
- Well?

79
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,971
The pilot you shot down told
me who you were.

80
00:14:27,281 --> 00:14:28,560
Did he survived?

81
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:32,482
Do you really care or are
you just curious?

82
00:14:32,825 --> 00:14:33,948
The latter.

83
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,223
At least you are honest.

84
00:14:36,591 --> 00:14:38,239
It's a start, isn't it?

85
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,787
Can you be caring without
being curious in the first place?

86
00:14:42,575 --> 00:14:44,964
So... What's your name?

87
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,932
His name is Captain Roy Brown.

88
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,216
And he's alive, no thanks to you.

89
00:14:51,217 --> 00:14:54,620
He told me you're
a supreme professional

90
00:14:54,985 --> 00:14:55,485
<i>Well done!</i>

91
00:14:55,575 --> 00:14:57,326
and a tricky rascal.

92
00:14:57,972 --> 00:14:58,760
Well...

93
00:14:58,761 --> 00:14:59,101
<i>Look...</i>

94
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,877
Tell him that I'm honor
by his compliments

95
00:15:01,878 --> 00:15:04,225
and hope I never have to meet

96
00:15:04,226 --> 00:15:05,623
him in the skies again.

97
00:15:06,484 --> 00:15:07,938
He might get the better of me.

98
00:15:08,785 --> 00:15:10,998
And I might not be lucky
enough to have

99
00:15:11,793 --> 00:15:13,622
such a gorgeous attendant.

100
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:18,467
Unbelievable. Enjoy your evening.

101
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:21,930
Do you happen to know what
became of my scarf?

102
00:15:22,961 --> 00:15:24,218
I'll have it send to you.

103
00:15:25,185 --> 00:15:26,456
No... Keep it.

104
00:15:26,457 --> 00:15:27,742
It will bring you luck!

105
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:29,525
The French have sent
their condolences

106
00:16:29,526 --> 00:16:31,396
and claimed the kill.

107
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,324
The service for Kielmeyer will be
held at 1600 hours.

108
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:39,153
The pilot who lead the attack
against us 4 days ago,

109
00:16:40,554 --> 00:16:41,699
it was Hawker.

110
00:16:42,903 --> 00:16:43,813
What?

111
00:16:44,033 --> 00:16:45,254
Major Lanoe Hawker?

112
00:16:47,681 --> 00:16:49,022
The very man.

113
00:16:50,537 --> 00:16:52,676
I saw his face... Full beard.

114
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,374
And the Grim Reaper painted
on his fuselage.

115
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:56,575
It's their top man.

116
00:16:58,137 --> 00:17:00,698
Oh shut up... Scary fellow.
He downs 9 of us.

117
00:17:01,195 --> 00:17:03,513
When they used to fly the
unarmed reconnaissance, he latched

118
00:17:03,514 --> 00:17:05,734
a one shot hunting rifle
to his fuselage.

119
00:17:05,735 --> 00:17:07,735
We almost touched wings.

120
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:09,064
Had a hard times to stay
out of his ways.

121
00:17:11,157 --> 00:17:13,261
When you got that close,
why didn't you attack?

122
00:17:14,152 --> 00:17:16,491
I only attack if I can win.

123
00:17:33,973 --> 00:17:35,886
How badly do you want the
<i>Pour le Merite?</i>

124
00:17:37,899 --> 00:17:39,261
I would kill for it.

125
00:17:41,148 --> 00:17:43,495
I just received a cable from
Supreme headquarters,

126
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:46,778
...and guess what?
They badly wants to give it to you.

127
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,219
Why don't they then?

128
00:17:49,729 --> 00:17:51,074
You know the rules.

129
00:17:51,075 --> 00:17:53,485
And not even Imperial command
would bend them for you,

130
00:17:53,486 --> 00:17:55,964
so hurry up and shoot down
a captured balloon.

131
00:17:57,802 --> 00:17:58,888
I hunt aeroplanes, sir!

132
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:01,777
Not objects that cannot move.

133
00:18:02,439 --> 00:18:03,919
You are not a hunter lieutenant,

134
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,547
you are a soldier
and you will follow orders

135
00:18:06,548 --> 00:18:09,505
especially when it comes straight
from General von Hoeppler.

136
00:18:24,574 --> 00:18:26,167
What if I shoot down Hawker?

137
00:18:26,498 --> 00:18:28,260
Stay away from Hawker.

138
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:30,136
You are no match for him.

139
00:18:37,935 --> 00:18:38,699
Let me through.

140
00:19:06,588 --> 00:19:08,306
Has anybody got a spanner?

141
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,214
I don't believe it.

142
00:19:42,036 --> 00:19:43,463
So you finally did it!

143
00:19:44,804 --> 00:19:46,428
You bagged yourself a legend.

144
00:19:47,755 --> 00:19:49,130
That made you a legend too!

145
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:53,719
Have one, my mother made them.

146
00:19:57,444 --> 00:19:59,554
Oswald Boelcke... First of the Aces.

147
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:00,964
They are desperate to find someone

148
00:20:00,965 --> 00:20:02,250
to fill the gap he left.

149
00:20:02,983 --> 00:20:04,095
You know what he once said
to me when I asked

150
00:20:04,096 --> 00:20:05,906
how he managed his business.

151
00:20:07,811 --> 00:20:09,235
"Well, it's quite simple...

152
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:11,920
...I fly close to my man...

153
00:20:11,921 --> 00:20:12,989
...aim well...

154
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,909
...and then of course he falls down."

155
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:20,115
Sterni and I are off to Arras,

156
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:21,985
why don't you join us for a drink?

157
00:20:22,334 --> 00:20:23,334
Not tonight!

158
00:20:23,434 --> 00:20:24,753
You could look for the little nurse.

159
00:20:25,848 --> 00:20:27,425
I mean the sooner you have her,

160
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:29,899
the sooner you get her out
of your system.

161
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,755
Can't have ties that involved,
can we?

162
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,085
Werner?

163
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:38,566
Hmm?

164
00:20:40,121 --> 00:20:42,094
I will filled the gap!

165
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,315
I will be the first of the Aces.

166
00:21:00,337 --> 00:21:01,431
Stop!

167
00:21:01,432 --> 00:21:03,069
There you go.

168
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:09,691
I'm starving.

169
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,191
Yeah, me too.

170
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,207
Prussians don't whine, gentlemen.

171
00:21:30,229 --> 00:21:31,275
Let's go.

172
00:21:33,866 --> 00:21:35,628
Go and find us some breakfast.

173
00:21:55,335 --> 00:21:56,881
At ease, gentlemen.

174
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,283
<i>L'ordre Pour Le Merite...</i>

175
00:22:02,241 --> 00:22:03,929
Where is it...

176
00:22:05,176 --> 00:22:07,956
Prussia's highest bravery award.

177
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:12,224
A year ago Boelcke was the first
pilot to ever received it.

178
00:22:13,777 --> 00:22:15,528
A lot has changed since...

179
00:22:16,942 --> 00:22:18,100
...right, Baron?

180
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:22,622
Indeed... sir!

181
00:22:23,005 --> 00:22:24,615
He only had to down 8 to get it.

182
00:22:24,616 --> 00:22:26,536
I shot down twice as many.

183
00:22:26,537 --> 00:22:29,865
An exception for you has
already been made, Richthofen.

184
00:22:29,866 --> 00:22:32,297
You... Still owe us that balloon,
don't you?

185
00:22:33,293 --> 00:22:36,516
However having shot down
the enemy's best

186
00:22:36,517 --> 00:22:38,229
"the notorious Captain Hawker"

187
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:43,105
you are now Germany's premier
air ace.

188
00:22:43,255 --> 00:22:45,792
You'll take over command of
11th Fighter wing.

189
00:22:45,793 --> 00:22:47,820
- Come!
- Excellent, sir.

190
00:22:48,831 --> 00:22:51,680
Have a look at this.
Here in the east,

191
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:54,815
the Tsar's armies are the least of
our problems, gentlemen.

192
00:22:55,293 --> 00:22:57,866
He'll soon have a revolution
on his hands.

193
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,293
Amusing, isn't it?

194
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:02,979
Lenin and his communists helping
the German emperor...

195
00:23:06,644 --> 00:23:09,631
The Western front is where
the danger lies.

196
00:23:11,017 --> 00:23:13,435
The British 1st and 3rd armies
are probing our lines

197
00:23:13,436 --> 00:23:15,129
with everything they've got.

198
00:23:16,137 --> 00:23:17,777
And they have got plenty.

199
00:23:22,606 --> 00:23:25,863
I must drive them back,

200
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:28,802
inch by inch and day by day,

201
00:23:29,998 --> 00:23:31,779
without Lenin's help.

202
00:23:37,198 --> 00:23:42,728
Richthofen, you'll be station
at LaBrayelles,

203
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,149
Northwest of Douai... Here!

204
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,610
Right in the middle.

205
00:23:52,271 --> 00:23:53,629
Sir?

206
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:55,065
Yes?

207
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:58,871
Isn't the middle supposed to be
closer to Paris by now, general?

208
00:23:59,051 --> 00:24:02,717
I mean, didn't you said that
we'll be there in 10 days...

209
00:24:02,717 --> 00:24:03,825
...2 months ago?

210
00:24:04,263 --> 00:24:04,888
Manfred!

211
00:24:17,146 --> 00:24:18,730
High command has given you a

212
00:24:18,731 --> 00:24:20,314
tremendous responsibility,
young man...

213
00:24:20,315 --> 00:24:22,145
going far beyond this medal.

214
00:24:22,863 --> 00:24:25,387
You're promoted to lead not
only the men

215
00:24:25,388 --> 00:24:27,974
of our futures placed under
your command,

216
00:24:28,209 --> 00:24:31,293
you've been chosen as a leader
of all fighting men.

217
00:24:31,294 --> 00:24:35,726
Symbol of courage, bravery
and overtness, determination.

218
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:39,585
A symbol of Germany's superiority.

219
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,249
Pilots are like Gods, Richthofen.

220
00:24:43,645 --> 00:24:46,692
When we lost Boelcke,
our troops lost a hero.

221
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:51,209
And if our enemy can killed God,
what chance...

222
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:56,333
Does the poor farmers dug deep
into the trenches thinks he has, hmm?

223
00:24:58,046 --> 00:24:59,397
Gods don't die.

224
00:24:59,909 --> 00:25:01,935
Do you understand it?

225
00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:04,868
Yes, sir.

226
00:25:05,724 --> 00:25:06,571
Fine!

227
00:25:07,416 --> 00:25:09,041
You're dismissed, gentlemen.

228
00:25:22,057 --> 00:25:23,232
Sir!

229
00:25:23,619 --> 00:25:24,381
Yes?

230
00:25:25,895 --> 00:25:26,618
Asked!

231
00:25:27,851 --> 00:25:32,520
Any chance of some croissants
and coffee?

232
00:25:56,745 --> 00:25:57,695
Here you are!

233
00:25:59,644 --> 00:26:00,758
Good morning mother.

234
00:26:01,316 --> 00:26:03,012
I take it you've a comfortable trip.

235
00:26:10,134 --> 00:26:13,134
When you're finally rid yourself
of this worn out jacket, Manfred?

236
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,449
- Where is it?
- Cousin... Brother!

237
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,385
You bastard!

238
00:26:19,423 --> 00:26:20,120
May I see it?

239
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:21,607
It's in there!

240
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,993
Here he is, my famous brother.
And he is still wearing

241
00:26:25,994 --> 00:26:27,272
this old jacket of his.

242
00:26:27,477 --> 00:26:28,832
I've already told him...

243
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:30,441
Stop making a fuss about my jacket!

244
00:26:31,085 --> 00:26:32,254
Give me a hug.

245
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:44,054
- <i>I still think that the jacket...</i>
- <i>Mom!</i>

246
00:26:53,686 --> 00:26:55,561
Good to have you home, son.

247
00:27:12,521 --> 00:27:15,221
- <i>Slow down... Low torque.</i>
- <i>I know!</i>

248
00:27:15,222 --> 00:27:16,953
<i>Keep your rudder straight.</i>

249
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,160
- <i>Stop now. Let me...</i>
- <i>Close up...</i>

250
00:27:23,447 --> 00:27:25,722
<i>I said straight... I said straight!</i>

251
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:29,367
- <i>You're not going straight.</i>
- <i>I can't concentrate.</i>

252
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:34,058
Everybody comes to honor our son,

253
00:27:34,158 --> 00:27:36,519
and all they do is played
with that plane.

254
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,852
...like little boys.

255
00:27:37,853 --> 00:27:40,466
As if my brothers would ever grow up.

256
00:27:40,467 --> 00:27:42,287
- Handsome little boys.
- Watch out!

257
00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:43,630
<i>I'm taking a left now.</i>

258
00:27:45,241 --> 00:27:46,241
<i>Slow down!</i>

259
00:27:47,414 --> 00:27:48,965
Let them enjoy their youth,

260
00:27:49,995 --> 00:27:51,667
whilst they can.

261
00:28:10,102 --> 00:28:10,802
<i>Watch out!</i>

262
00:28:11,168 --> 00:28:12,468
<i>Watch the hay stack!</i>

263
00:28:25,118 --> 00:28:26,454
You said you could fly a plane.

264
00:28:27,495 --> 00:28:28,586
I can't!

265
00:28:29,932 --> 00:28:31,511
Wait till I'm sitting in
a real plane.

266
00:28:32,117 --> 00:28:33,603
I'll beat your score.

267
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:43,471
<i>Hey!</i>

268
00:28:51,004 --> 00:28:52,004
<i>Let go of me!</i>

269
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:01,227
Keep the sun on your back.

270
00:29:01,554 --> 00:29:02,980
Don't fire too soon.

271
00:29:03,415 --> 00:29:05,933
It just warn your opponents,
it has no other effects.

272
00:29:07,352 --> 00:29:10,211
The best range for shooting
is 50 meters, not more.

273
00:29:11,184 --> 00:29:12,811
But remember,

274
00:29:12,911 --> 00:29:16,186
our tasks is to bring
down aeroplanes, not men.

275
00:29:16,823 --> 00:29:19,514
So stop firing when your
opponent's falling.

276
00:29:21,077 --> 00:29:22,870
Gentlemen, we are sportsmen...

277
00:29:24,073 --> 00:29:25,056
not butchers.

278
00:29:32,342 --> 00:29:33,512
- <i>Merci.</i>
- <i>De rien.</i>

279
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,229
Gentlemen!

280
00:29:40,664 --> 00:29:42,734
I'd like you to meet my
chief mechanic...

281
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:44,530
Sergeant Reuber.

282
00:29:48,104 --> 00:29:49,119
Dismissed!

283
00:29:51,773 --> 00:29:52,697
Sir!

284
00:29:53,498 --> 00:29:54,976
Stop clicking your heels, Wentzke.

285
00:29:55,304 --> 00:29:56,883
Yes, sir!

286
00:29:58,824 --> 00:30:00,977
- Hello!
- Oh, I almost forgot...

287
00:30:02,478 --> 00:30:06,148
if each of you hasn't shot down
at least one in the next 4 weeks,

288
00:30:06,149 --> 00:30:07,460
you're fired.

289
00:30:30,019 --> 00:30:30,927
Lieutenant!

290
00:30:31,456 --> 00:30:33,862
This is a hospital,
who do you think you are?

291
00:31:07,508 --> 00:31:08,681
I'm sorry.

292
00:31:09,087 --> 00:31:10,430
You knew him well?

293
00:31:15,756 --> 00:31:17,104
I still don't know your name...

294
00:31:17,978 --> 00:31:20,283
Kate Otersdorf.

295
00:31:21,105 --> 00:31:23,258
<i>Un nom allemand</i>, a german name?

296
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,070
<i>My father was German,
my mother is Belgian.</i>

297
00:31:27,431 --> 00:31:28,445
I see.

298
00:31:29,741 --> 00:31:31,445
I love these french cigarettes.

299
00:31:42,912 --> 00:31:43,931
You are...

300
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,179
...a very beautiful woman.

301
00:31:49,483 --> 00:31:50,930
I was hoping to see you again.

302
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:54,209
And I thought maybe wearing my scarf.

303
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:57,430
I will get it for you.

304
00:32:13,286 --> 00:32:15,199
I couldn't get all the stains out.

305
00:32:16,881 --> 00:32:17,671
<i>Mademoiselle!</i>

306
00:32:18,704 --> 00:32:20,226
Have I done something wrong?

307
00:32:21,241 --> 00:32:23,757
Am I not worth an answer
or is it just you hate all men?

308
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:24,868
Hate?

309
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,826
I don't hate you.

310
00:32:28,004 --> 00:32:29,179
Hate is men's domain.

311
00:32:29,936 --> 00:32:31,368
But you are angry, aren't you?

312
00:32:33,355 --> 00:32:35,312
There is another man's blood on it.

313
00:32:35,677 --> 00:32:37,368
And you do not seems to care.

314
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:40,233
Men like you scared me because

315
00:32:40,243 --> 00:32:42,550
I do not understand why
you do what you do.

316
00:32:43,793 --> 00:32:45,616
And being scared makes me angry.

317
00:32:47,212 --> 00:32:50,193
And now please, leave me alone.

318
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,241
Wait, Wait!

319
00:32:54,658 --> 00:32:56,366
Imagined you were out there...

320
00:32:57,086 --> 00:32:58,022
Like a hawk.

321
00:32:58,241 --> 00:32:59,365
Looking down...

322
00:33:00,786 --> 00:33:02,354
The wind blows around you.

323
00:33:02,662 --> 00:33:05,932
The smell of the engine,
draft from the propeller.

324
00:33:07,288 --> 00:33:08,576
Out there you can just not fall,

325
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:11,479
you can climb, turn, spin...

326
00:33:12,425 --> 00:33:13,405
Freedom!

327
00:33:15,304 --> 00:33:16,951
That's what men always dreamt of.

328
00:33:18,608 --> 00:33:20,521
I've dreamt of it since
I was a little boy.

329
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,574
But the best part,

330
00:33:23,929 --> 00:33:25,307
is the chase!

331
00:33:25,308 --> 00:33:26,583
The fights...

332
00:33:26,992 --> 00:33:28,228
The hunt!

333
00:33:29,651 --> 00:33:30,669
It's like a match.

334
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:33,117
A joust, just like sports.

335
00:33:35,523 --> 00:33:36,994
Tennis does not kill you.

336
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:41,288
It's childish dreams that
got your friends killed.

337
00:33:45,678 --> 00:33:47,338
No, I don't hate you, Baron.

338
00:33:49,452 --> 00:33:50,553
I pity you.

339
00:33:56,418 --> 00:33:58,307
Gentlemen, please!

340
00:33:59,154 --> 00:34:00,656
It shouldn't be that hard...

341
00:34:00,657 --> 00:34:02,211
to paint a plane, should it?

342
00:34:04,588 --> 00:34:05,872
Just do it!

343
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:06,994
Reuber!

344
00:34:15,788 --> 00:34:16,726
Manfred...

345
00:34:16,727 --> 00:34:17,901
What's wrong with you?

346
00:34:18,279 --> 00:34:20,896
What is this crazy paint
job all about?

347
00:34:22,486 --> 00:34:25,152
Honestly, you know damn well OCA
will crucify you for this!

348
00:34:25,353 --> 00:34:28,231
I don't care about what the 'Officers
in Charge of Aviation' think of this

349
00:34:28,241 --> 00:34:30,072
and you better not question
my orders.

350
00:34:31,116 --> 00:34:32,969
I just think you're making a mistake.

351
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:35,554
They will spot you from
a long way off.

352
00:34:35,654 --> 00:34:38,205
We completely lose the
advantage of surprise.

353
00:34:38,215 --> 00:34:39,968
I don't want them to be surprise.

354
00:34:41,442 --> 00:34:43,076
I want them to be scared.

355
00:34:53,118 --> 00:34:55,359
Lieutenant Kurt Wolff reporting
for duty, sir.

356
00:34:59,584 --> 00:35:01,638
Planning to take a nap up
there, lieutenant?

357
00:35:02,795 --> 00:35:04,133
Never fly without it, sir!

358
00:35:04,134 --> 00:35:05,931
You know, for luck!

359
00:35:05,941 --> 00:35:06,891
Superstitious huh!

360
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:08,855
Like me...

361
00:35:10,117 --> 00:35:11,949
My mother keeps ordering new coats

362
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:14,662
from our tailor,
I've never pick them up.

363
00:35:17,485 --> 00:35:18,553
See you around.

364
00:35:38,623 --> 00:35:39,126
Sir!

365
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,102
The general!

366
00:35:41,103 --> 00:35:42,656
General von Hoeppner!

367
00:35:43,367 --> 00:35:44,807
Over here, sir!

368
00:35:50,741 --> 00:35:52,794
You've become quite
a celebrity, Baron.

369
00:35:52,795 --> 00:35:54,259
You are making headlines.

370
00:35:58,696 --> 00:36:00,741
The emperor himself mentioned
your name

371
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:03,243
after hearing about your
29th victory.

372
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:04,822
So...

373
00:36:06,181 --> 00:36:08,484
I brought a little surprise
for you...

374
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:11,079
Didn't they runs out of medals
to give me?

375
00:36:13,673 --> 00:36:15,914
Well, it isn't exactly a medal.

376
00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:17,310
Sir...

377
00:36:24,745 --> 00:36:25,746
It wasn't my idea.

378
00:36:26,108 --> 00:36:27,746
We just thought it would
be good propaganda.

379
00:36:28,028 --> 00:36:30,183
"The Richthofen Brothers
flying together."

380
00:36:32,807 --> 00:36:33,526
Welcome.

381
00:36:35,006 --> 00:36:36,559
Your brother is a nice chap.

382
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,473
He really has the spirit our
Fatherland needs right now.

383
00:36:40,016 --> 00:36:41,350
So tell me...

384
00:36:41,602 --> 00:36:43,776
They comes out with this
strange names for you...

385
00:36:43,934 --> 00:36:44,978
<i>"Le Diable Rouge"</i>

386
00:36:44,979 --> 00:36:46,663
or "The Red Baron"

387
00:36:47,753 --> 00:36:48,882
Why is that?

388
00:37:09,951 --> 00:37:11,037
I see.

389
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:14,649
So much about army rules
and regulations.

390
00:37:18,381 --> 00:37:19,491
Interesting!

391
00:37:21,227 --> 00:37:22,621
Very interesting!

392
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,256
Tried to keep the sun on your back...

393
00:37:34,259 --> 00:37:35,258
Watch out for the winds.

394
00:37:36,037 --> 00:37:37,111
And never forget,

395
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:40,317
a pilot greatest virtue is to know
when to run.

396
00:37:40,327 --> 00:37:42,581
What... What this a joke?

397
00:37:43,081 --> 00:37:44,913
Just do what he tells you
to do, Lothar.

398
00:37:44,914 --> 00:37:46,205
Run away from a fight?

399
00:37:46,632 --> 00:37:47,636
Yes!

400
00:37:47,637 --> 00:37:49,759
- If you cannot win, you fly away!
- Fast!

401
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,539
It's a thin line between cowardice
and cleverness.

402
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,997
It's true.

403
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,600
Alright!

404
00:37:56,601 --> 00:37:58,053
Morning, gentlemen.

405
00:37:58,054 --> 00:37:59,499
That's a great idea.

406
00:37:59,696 --> 00:38:01,473
I already heard rumours that
the French thinks

407
00:38:01,474 --> 00:38:03,249
this paint is bulletproof.

408
00:38:10,702 --> 00:38:12,130
I wouldn't take this with me.

409
00:38:12,131 --> 00:38:14,180
It could get on the way up there.

410
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:28,929
This looks much better.

411
00:38:35,328 --> 00:38:37,129
The crop stays here.

412
00:38:42,413 --> 00:38:45,695
- Scattered them up, didn't we?
- Yeah, it was getting busy up there.

413
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,648
Damn French knows how to
protect their observation balloons.

414
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,432
I'm alright.

415
00:38:50,176 --> 00:38:51,545
It was fun, wasn't it?

416
00:38:53,692 --> 00:38:55,620
Can I stay at your cottage tonight?

417
00:38:55,621 --> 00:38:57,591
- Already feeling lonely?
- Yeah.

418
00:38:58,012 --> 00:38:59,975
Did you have him transfer?

419
00:39:00,497 --> 00:39:01,324
Who?

420
00:39:01,325 --> 00:39:02,942
Your brother, Lothar.

421
00:39:04,225 --> 00:39:05,911
Where is he? Did you see him?

422
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,671
He was right behind me.

423
00:39:07,672 --> 00:39:09,527
You better keep an eye on
your little brother.

424
00:39:09,528 --> 00:39:11,276
He has a hell of
a dangerous attitude.

425
00:39:22,042 --> 00:39:22,810
Oh for God sake.

426
00:39:22,811 --> 00:39:23,925
Let the poor fellow land.

427
00:39:24,072 --> 00:39:24,927
<i>What is he doing?</i>

428
00:39:34,259 --> 00:39:35,584
God... for Christ sake, Lothar!

429
00:39:35,872 --> 00:39:37,663
You shot this poor bastard to pieces.

430
00:39:38,861 --> 00:39:41,296
You think this makes our
father proud?

431
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:44,254
He lost his hearing saving
a wounded enemy.

432
00:39:44,522 --> 00:39:46,990
So now you want to win a war
without killing anyone, huh?

433
00:39:50,007 --> 00:39:52,703
I've watched you and Voss, and
I don't like what I see.

434
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:55,761
You are all...
you are all brilliant pilots,

435
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:57,368
but you've got the wrong attitude.

436
00:39:58,975 --> 00:40:01,561
This business of painting
a war plane red...

437
00:40:02,913 --> 00:40:03,959
Stop dreaming!

438
00:40:04,992 --> 00:40:06,196
This is just not a polo game.

439
00:40:06,462 --> 00:40:08,185
We are not boys anymore,
we're grown men

440
00:40:08,186 --> 00:40:09,694
fighting a bloody war.

441
00:40:10,076 --> 00:40:11,449
I'm quite aware of that.

442
00:40:13,089 --> 00:40:14,714
I'm quite aware of that!

443
00:40:15,386 --> 00:40:17,842
But still,
we can fight it with grace.

444
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:31,163
What?

445
00:40:33,327 --> 00:40:34,396
You were listening?

446
00:40:34,397 --> 00:40:36,069
The <i>Marseilles</i> heard you in Paris.

447
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,900
- ...and Berlin.
- Come on, he is just ambitious.

448
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,433
Well, have him contained then.

449
00:40:40,412 --> 00:40:43,648
I for one, I don't want to get kill
because of his ambitions.

450
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:46,500
And I hate to see you
get kill either.

451
00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:08,457
Morning my dear Hindenburg,

452
00:42:10,101 --> 00:42:12,683
and my dear friend von Hoeppner.

453
00:42:13,246 --> 00:42:15,735
Welcome to Berlin, gentlemen.

454
00:42:30,074 --> 00:42:33,589
The young man already seems to be
more famous than...

455
00:42:34,949 --> 00:42:36,186
...What was his name?

456
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:38,279
- Oswald Boelcke, your Majesty.
- Yes... Yes!

457
00:42:39,072 --> 00:42:40,748
We need men like him.

458
00:42:41,451 --> 00:42:42,335
I supposed...

459
00:42:43,129 --> 00:42:47,905
We'll have to give you
another promotion, Richthofen.

460
00:42:49,645 --> 00:42:51,928
You are a real hero.

461
00:42:54,536 --> 00:42:59,862
I take it the ladies're all over you.

462
00:43:00,617 --> 00:43:03,269
There aren't many ladies
at 10,000 feet, your Majesty.

463
00:43:15,215 --> 00:43:17,311
Corp, attention!

464
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,728
Well, are you ready, gentlemen?

465
00:44:43,182 --> 00:44:44,056
<i>Move on!</i>

466
00:44:44,156 --> 00:44:45,019
<i>Don't fall asleep.</i>

467
00:44:49,097 --> 00:44:50,361
<i>Move on.</i>

468
00:44:56,299 --> 00:44:57,237
<i>Captain!</i>

469
00:44:57,782 --> 00:44:59,007
What shall we do, sir?

470
00:44:59,267 --> 00:45:00,476
I could run them over.

471
00:45:01,394 --> 00:45:03,097
Put the pistol away.

472
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:06,860
What did he say?

473
00:45:06,861 --> 00:45:08,516
He wants my Captain's autograph.

474
00:45:18,224 --> 00:45:18,924
<i>Merci!</i>

475
00:45:21,673 --> 00:45:22,444
Ready!

476
00:45:22,445 --> 00:45:23,316
Go!

477
00:45:28,295 --> 00:45:29,422
- Ready!
- Go!

478
00:45:33,876 --> 00:45:35,177
How did you know?

479
00:45:35,578 --> 00:45:37,223
I saw you lose it.

480
00:46:12,231 --> 00:46:13,512
Good morning, gentlemen.

481
00:46:13,513 --> 00:46:14,708
Bodenschatz! Welcome!

482
00:46:15,134 --> 00:46:16,335
My new adjutant.

483
00:46:16,336 --> 00:46:17,459
Kurt Wolff!

484
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,590
- Welcome!
- I've heard a lot about you.

485
00:46:19,852 --> 00:46:20,555
Thanks.

486
00:46:21,888 --> 00:46:23,176
Orders, Sternberg, orders.

487
00:46:23,456 --> 00:46:25,239
My new commanding officer is the man

488
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,119
I commanded not so long ago.

489
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,419
So...

490
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:31,246
I've heard you chaps ran into some
massive Allied aerial activities?

491
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:32,679
More than massive.

492
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,338
Germany produces 10 planes,

493
00:46:34,339 --> 00:46:36,996
they've got hunderds unloaded
in the French coast.

494
00:46:37,021 --> 00:46:37,858
Let them come.

495
00:46:38,851 --> 00:46:40,754
We'll shoot them out of the
skies by the hundreds.

496
00:46:42,244 --> 00:46:43,707
Meet brother Lothar...

497
00:51:07,797 --> 00:51:08,911
No! Damn!

498
00:51:10,238 --> 00:51:13,069
You bastards! You fucking bastard!

499
00:53:13,507 --> 00:53:14,650
Damn gophers!

500
00:53:15,033 --> 00:53:17,441
You know it's pure luck I didn't ran
into one of those damn holes myself.

501
00:53:18,589 --> 00:53:20,063
Thank you for being so tactful.

502
00:53:20,812 --> 00:53:23,761
After embarrassing me by landing
safely with shredded fins.

503
00:53:24,691 --> 00:53:28,029
I've come to have a look.
Sopwith, right? New, isn't it?

504
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:30,214
It was...

505
00:53:30,885 --> 00:53:34,070
Captain Brown,
Royal Academy Flying Corp.

506
00:53:34,687 --> 00:53:36,633
Notorious Red Baron, I presume?

507
00:53:37,975 --> 00:53:40,226
Didn't I shoot you down a year ago?

508
00:53:40,851 --> 00:53:42,211
Indeed you did.

509
00:53:42,558 --> 00:53:44,160
Why're you still flying around then?

510
00:53:44,859 --> 00:53:46,624
Well, your prison camps
are quite fancy,

511
00:53:46,625 --> 00:53:48,388
however they don't have airfields.

512
00:53:51,747 --> 00:53:53,824
Thanks for pulling me out
of that wreck,

513
00:53:55,242 --> 00:53:56,536
for saving my life.

514
00:54:00,917 --> 00:54:02,870
Pulling you from that wreck
didn't save your live.

515
00:54:04,883 --> 00:54:05,742
True.

516
00:54:06,726 --> 00:54:10,030
Without her help I probably wouldn't
have make it back into a plane.

517
00:54:10,031 --> 00:54:11,508
She's sure is a great girl.

518
00:54:12,101 --> 00:54:13,913
She nursed me for weeks.

519
00:54:15,147 --> 00:54:16,482
Did you ever get back your scarf?

520
00:54:22,465 --> 00:54:23,820
What now?

521
00:54:24,509 --> 00:54:26,619
I guess we could try killing each
other with our pistols.

522
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:28,905
Killing you would make me famous too.

523
00:54:28,906 --> 00:54:30,149
Sorry, I didn't bring mine

524
00:54:30,159 --> 00:54:32,396
but you might want to button up
your holster before you lose yours.

525
00:54:48,366 --> 00:54:50,149
How long have you been
station in Europe?

526
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:52,349
Ever since Mother England called
the kids for help.

527
00:54:53,871 --> 00:54:56,082
Meaning us,
the Commonwealth colonies.

528
00:54:57,066 --> 00:55:00,215
You're right. The entire war seems
to be a family affair.

529
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:02,991
Family ties is what you aristocrats
are all about.

530
00:55:03,227 --> 00:55:04,956
Russian Tsar, the Royal familes
in Britain,

531
00:55:04,966 --> 00:55:06,705
France, Austria, Germany...

532
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:10,558
Everyone is someone's nephew,
uncle, brother.

533
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:12,909
Man, your love life sure knows
them all borders.

534
00:55:13,883 --> 00:55:16,535
But to protect those borders,
we killed each other off anyway.

535
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:20,010
And we always managed to find good
enough reasons, don't we?

536
00:55:27,588 --> 00:55:29,445
You didn't unsnapped that holster's
guard because you were

537
00:55:29,446 --> 00:55:31,301
afraid of me, did you?

538
00:55:31,445 --> 00:55:33,056
You have damn good eyes.

539
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:36,509
You thought about killing me?

540
00:55:37,382 --> 00:55:39,304
Isn't killing each other the reason
why we are here?

541
00:55:42,383 --> 00:55:43,261
Yes!

542
00:55:47,353 --> 00:55:48,548
Be seeing you.

543
00:55:50,133 --> 00:55:52,695
Don't get me wrong but I hope not.

544
00:55:56,663 --> 00:55:57,779
Yes!

545
00:56:04,998 --> 00:56:06,432
So long then.

546
00:56:06,906 --> 00:56:08,039
Good luck.

547
00:56:11,297 --> 00:56:12,852
Fucking family...

548
00:56:14,086 --> 00:56:16,588
Sooner or later this war
will be over.

549
00:56:17,133 --> 00:56:19,444
You should hook up with that nurse.

550
00:56:20,154 --> 00:56:21,804
I think she's got the hot for you.

551
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:24,695
What makes you say that?

552
00:56:25,976 --> 00:56:27,758
She kept bitching about
you for weeks.

553
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:57,259
Stop the truck!

554
00:56:59,967 --> 00:57:01,107
Stop the truck!

555
00:57:11,057 --> 00:57:12,822
There you are, we just found him.

556
00:57:24,539 --> 00:57:25,352
Sterni!

557
00:57:27,728 --> 00:57:28,885
Get a doctor here.

558
00:57:28,985 --> 00:57:31,257
He doesn't need a doctor,
he needs a priest.

559
00:57:32,542 --> 00:57:33,445
A rabbi.

560
00:57:33,858 --> 00:57:34,857
Oh really?

561
00:58:05,778 --> 00:58:07,091
He's dead, Manfred.

562
00:58:53,653 --> 00:58:54,653
I'm catching up, brother.

563
00:58:59,813 --> 00:59:01,569
It's days now since we buried him.

564
00:59:13,211 --> 00:59:14,977
Why is it you can't enjoy
the fact that

565
00:59:14,978 --> 00:59:16,742
I've been promoted. I'm your brother.

566
00:59:32,212 --> 00:59:33,822
He was a friend of yours, I know.

567
00:59:36,134 --> 00:59:37,525
But he was a fighter pilot too.

568
00:59:38,757 --> 00:59:40,008
He knew the risks he took.

569
00:59:43,652 --> 00:59:45,678
Every oath soldiers proudly take,

570
00:59:47,494 --> 00:59:50,190
but you are more than a soldier,
you are a superior officer!

571
00:59:52,228 --> 00:59:54,496
You have a responsibility
towards the men out there!

572
00:59:55,212 --> 00:59:56,892
Towards your country and your people.

573
01:00:05,464 --> 01:00:06,823
You know what our father
always said...

574
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:11,387
"A leader cannot afford to mourn."

575
01:01:22,757 --> 01:01:23,842
You smell nice.

576
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:27,534
Much better than all the flowers.

577
01:01:33,542 --> 01:01:35,792
You're still a little boy playing
silly games.

578
01:01:39,132 --> 01:01:40,420
You haven't changed.

579
01:01:43,249 --> 01:01:44,860
I'm not so sure about that.

580
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:50,716
A while ago, I wouldn't have let
myself got shot down.

581
01:01:52,492 --> 01:01:53,226
Turn over.

582
01:02:11,383 --> 01:02:13,419
So much for "Germany's bravest."

583
01:02:16,947 --> 01:02:18,774
I'm sick of men keeps bringing
this report of

584
01:02:18,775 --> 01:02:20,600
our lack of success every damn day.

585
01:02:22,222 --> 01:02:23,864
I'm just trying to fill
your seat, sir.

586
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:25,382
You send out single squadron,

587
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:26,397
Doering.

588
01:02:27,545 --> 01:02:28,930
They're in no position to
battle successfully

589
01:02:28,931 --> 01:02:31,115
against enemy formations.

590
01:02:31,962 --> 01:02:33,668
Captain Doering has his orders.

591
01:02:34,359 --> 01:02:37,384
The 'Officer in Charge of Avaition'
arranges us on a time table, sir.

592
01:02:37,681 --> 01:02:39,228
They are a bunch of idiots.

593
01:02:39,852 --> 01:02:41,821
Condemning us to routine
burial flights.

594
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:43,944
We needs to be flexible.

595
01:02:44,357 --> 01:02:45,091
Loose!

596
01:02:45,616 --> 01:02:47,399
Hit the enemy where he actually is.

597
01:02:51,002 --> 01:02:52,807
The British and French moved
their airbase

598
01:02:52,808 --> 01:02:54,611
wherever and whenever they like.

599
01:02:55,163 --> 01:02:55,854
Yes!

600
01:02:58,032 --> 01:03:00,653
We hardly ever down their
damn planes.

601
01:03:03,984 --> 01:03:07,526
I order you, to ignore OCA orders.

602
01:03:48,305 --> 01:03:51,461
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Otersdorf,
what are you doing?

603
01:03:52,806 --> 01:03:54,154
Just following orders, Baron.

604
01:03:57,022 --> 01:03:58,326
You were ordered to come with us?

605
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:00,335
Yes.

606
01:04:37,083 --> 01:04:39,309
<i>Richthofen, nice to have you
back, sir!</i>

607
01:04:41,541 --> 01:04:42,615
Welcome back.

608
01:05:04,291 --> 01:05:06,118
The red ones are the 11th wing.

609
01:05:08,342 --> 01:05:09,820
The yellow 10th.

610
01:05:11,647 --> 01:05:13,197
The Zebras... No: 6.

611
01:05:13,583 --> 01:05:15,021
And the black ones No: 4.

612
01:05:16,165 --> 01:05:17,665
You're looking at the most successful

613
01:05:17,666 --> 01:05:19,165
fighter squadron of the war.

614
01:05:19,988 --> 01:05:22,128
And these men are the best pilots
in the skies.

615
01:05:30,664 --> 01:05:32,360
I thought it would never happen.

616
01:05:32,554 --> 01:05:33,288
What?

617
01:05:34,045 --> 01:05:35,411
See you smile.

618
01:05:41,811 --> 01:05:43,463
I thought you're not supposed to fly.

619
01:05:53,042 --> 01:05:54,917
Your nurse is a very good
looking girl.

620
01:06:00,245 --> 01:06:02,485
I've got a hole in my head
but I'm not blind.

621
01:06:06,424 --> 01:06:08,497
I am already fit enough to
punch you in the face.

622
01:06:14,675 --> 01:06:15,695
What are you writing?

623
01:06:17,408 --> 01:06:18,730
A book.

624
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:21,409
About flying.

625
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:23,739
What are you reading?

626
01:06:24,366 --> 01:06:25,780
I never see you without a book.

627
01:06:26,389 --> 01:06:27,770
No?

628
01:06:28,017 --> 01:06:29,225
Oscar Wilde!

629
01:06:31,076 --> 01:06:32,180
You ever read one?

630
01:06:36,742 --> 01:06:37,470
No...

631
01:06:37,804 --> 01:06:40,331
I cannot see any
British literature in here.

632
01:06:43,426 --> 01:06:43,926
Hmm!

633
01:06:45,810 --> 01:06:46,935
Try this!

634
01:06:50,123 --> 01:06:51,466
There must be

635
01:06:52,207 --> 01:06:53,669
Shakespeare in there somewhere...

636
01:06:54,077 --> 01:06:55,598
My father read his play's once.

637
01:06:55,936 --> 01:06:56,685
'Lear...'

638
01:06:56,686 --> 01:06:58,097
'Comedy of Errors.'

639
01:06:58,661 --> 01:07:00,623
You might find a couple
of songs too...

640
01:07:01,331 --> 01:07:03,140
and a lot of playing billards,

641
01:07:05,059 --> 01:07:07,748
hunting, flying, riding...

642
01:07:07,997 --> 01:07:10,461
ahem... How to flirt.

643
01:07:19,791 --> 01:07:21,487
A hole in the head makes reading
someone mind

644
01:07:21,488 --> 01:07:22,966
pretty easy, Baron.

645
01:07:24,647 --> 01:07:25,686
So...

646
01:07:27,897 --> 01:07:28,607
Just ask.

647
01:07:35,935 --> 01:07:37,093
Would you...

648
01:07:38,710 --> 01:07:40,640
Would you join me for dinner?

649
01:07:42,496 --> 01:07:43,424
Yes.

650
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:15,203
So?

651
01:08:16,252 --> 01:08:17,290
Difference...

652
01:08:17,841 --> 01:08:19,513
from what I thought you would be.

653
01:08:21,851 --> 01:08:23,048
Different?

654
01:08:23,601 --> 01:08:25,077
Your write,

655
01:08:25,581 --> 01:08:28,106
it's entertaining.

656
01:08:28,410 --> 01:08:30,044
You thought it would be blunt,

657
01:08:30,748 --> 01:08:31,459
boring...

658
01:08:31,824 --> 01:08:32,906
and deadly serious.

659
01:08:32,907 --> 01:08:33,406
No!

660
01:08:34,685 --> 01:08:36,375
But you write about war.

661
01:08:36,376 --> 01:08:38,561
I thought there would fanaticism...
Patriotism.

662
01:08:38,890 --> 01:08:40,841
Patriotism... hmm.

663
01:08:42,426 --> 01:08:43,990
"...the virtue of the vicious."

664
01:08:48,077 --> 01:08:49,343
You did read Wilde.

665
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:51,258
Even a little Dante.

666
01:08:52,636 --> 01:08:54,114
It's helpful right now.

667
01:08:54,894 --> 01:08:57,806
To knows a little about infernos,
isn't it?

668
01:09:01,970 --> 01:09:03,094
Dance with me.

669
01:09:04,732 --> 01:09:05,576
No.

670
01:09:06,098 --> 01:09:06,913
Better not... no.

671
01:09:08,163 --> 01:09:09,591
I am an infernally miserable dancer.

672
01:09:10,126 --> 01:09:11,873
Imagined you're flying...

673
01:09:50,765 --> 01:09:51,719
Great!

674
01:09:54,311 --> 01:09:55,766
To have a hole in my head.

675
01:09:58,608 --> 01:10:01,235
Without it I wouldn't be sitting
here next to you, would I?

676
01:10:09,982 --> 01:10:10,843
Mentzke...

677
01:10:12,328 --> 01:10:14,092
Can you turn the car around?

678
01:10:48,435 --> 01:10:50,076
There are so many hospitals
now they have

679
01:10:50,077 --> 01:10:52,114
to give them numbers.

680
01:10:52,924 --> 01:10:54,220
This is No: 76.

681
01:10:56,091 --> 01:10:57,582
There's 500 patients.

682
01:11:00,061 --> 01:11:01,546
Most of these men will die.

683
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:04,303
Those that don't,
will never walk again,

684
01:11:04,784 --> 01:11:05,468
see again,

685
01:11:06,426 --> 01:11:07,585
taste again...

686
01:11:08,402 --> 01:11:09,107
love again!

687
01:11:12,436 --> 01:11:14,697
No, it's not great to have
a hole your head.

688
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:18,186
You're lucky to be still alive.

689
01:11:20,436 --> 01:11:23,610
Being born of nobility, you've
advantages these men here do not.

690
01:11:25,452 --> 01:11:26,670
They don't have choices.

691
01:11:27,655 --> 01:11:28,800
It's not a game.

692
01:11:31,096 --> 01:11:33,096
This is the lowest we'll ever get.

693
01:11:35,810 --> 01:11:37,462
It never gets darker.

694
01:12:50,285 --> 01:12:51,266
Come in.

695
01:13:08,928 --> 01:13:12,310
Can you give me something
for my head?

696
01:14:29,848 --> 01:14:30,674
Go to the cellar.

697
01:14:31,434 --> 01:14:32,278
Now!

698
01:14:33,434 --> 01:14:34,770
They fly at night?

699
01:14:39,716 --> 01:14:40,888
Get yourself a gas mask.

700
01:14:42,575 --> 01:14:43,720
Do you fly at night?

701
01:14:45,028 --> 01:14:46,548
No, we don't!

702
01:14:51,417 --> 01:14:52,074
<i>Here.</i>

703
01:14:54,533 --> 01:14:55,441
<i>Find a save place.</i>

704
01:14:59,851 --> 01:15:00,762
Lights out!

705
01:15:00,975 --> 01:15:02,285
<i>Everybody turns off the lights.</i>

706
01:15:02,286 --> 01:15:03,167
Give it to me.

707
01:15:03,283 --> 01:15:04,457
It's OCA, sir.

708
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:05,576
This is Bodenschatz.

709
01:15:06,185 --> 01:15:07,383
Turn off all the lights!

710
01:15:09,233 --> 01:15:10,264
Night bombers!

711
01:15:10,388 --> 01:15:11,403
Good morning captain!

712
01:15:11,404 --> 01:15:12,388
Four already passed

713
01:15:12,389 --> 01:15:13,375
and four more coming.

714
01:15:13,376 --> 01:15:15,028
Just take it all,
it could be worse, sir.

715
01:15:15,813 --> 01:15:18,030
It's not as if they just happened
to fly past, Doering.

716
01:15:19,674 --> 01:15:21,909
They know about this field and 
there will be more than eight.

717
01:15:21,919 --> 01:15:22,685
Lots more!

718
01:15:53,051 --> 01:15:53,871
Good morning.

719
01:15:54,595 --> 01:15:55,834
- Good morning.
- Morning, sir!

720
01:15:56,540 --> 01:15:57,546
Wolff, you alright?

721
01:15:57,646 --> 01:15:58,609
I can't find my cap!

722
01:15:58,729 --> 01:16:00,611
All machine-gun posts are
being manned.

723
01:16:00,714 --> 01:16:03,378
There's nothing more we can do
to protect the planes on the ground.

724
01:16:03,658 --> 01:16:04,658
Mentzke, get my gear!

725
01:16:05,641 --> 01:16:06,554
Ready my plane.

726
01:16:07,378 --> 01:16:09,200
You are injured,
you cannot fly, Manfred.

727
01:16:09,201 --> 01:16:10,853
I'm not going to be a sitting duck.

728
01:16:11,231 --> 01:16:12,090
I've got wings.

729
01:18:31,893 --> 01:18:33,969
You flew right in between them,
are you out of your mind?

730
01:18:35,473 --> 01:18:36,295
Take me to her...

731
01:18:47,498 --> 01:18:48,609
You've to lay still.

732
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,423
Go and find her.

733
01:18:51,658 --> 01:18:53,253
I just need to know if
she's not hurt.

734
01:19:10,594 --> 01:19:11,642
It looks plainer.

735
01:19:14,733 --> 01:19:17,045
Fokker built this great new plane,

736
01:19:19,216 --> 01:19:20,825
as maneuverable as the devil.

737
01:19:23,731 --> 01:19:25,043
They climb like monkeys.

738
01:19:31,324 --> 01:19:32,734
I know you are angry with me.

739
01:19:57,185 --> 01:19:59,034
I've been ordered back
to the hospital.

740
01:20:00,530 --> 01:20:01,371
I know.

741
01:20:10,150 --> 01:20:12,076
I'm sorry about Kurt Wolff.

742
01:20:14,238 --> 01:20:15,737
He was a charming young man.

743
01:20:17,107 --> 01:20:19,157
He forgot his night cap, you know.

744
01:20:19,418 --> 01:20:20,686
His lucky night cap.

745
01:20:23,891 --> 01:20:24,656
Baron...

746
01:20:26,970 --> 01:20:27,735
Yes?

747
01:20:27,981 --> 01:20:29,859
Take me to dinner again
with you sometime.

748
01:20:30,934 --> 01:20:33,553
And promise to always
wear this lucky jacket of yours.

749
01:21:05,787 --> 01:21:06,906
We are not late, are we?

750
01:21:07,151 --> 01:21:08,058
No, we aren't.

751
01:21:24,036 --> 01:21:24,721
Lavatory?

752
01:21:24,722 --> 01:21:26,237
Down the stairs to the right, sir.

753
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:27,326
Back in a minute.

754
01:21:47,422 --> 01:21:48,496
Attention!

755
01:21:50,277 --> 01:21:51,842
<i>Everything goes according to plan.</i>

756
01:21:51,843 --> 01:21:54,440
- Yes!
- Very satisfactory, yes.

757
01:21:54,517 --> 01:21:55,243
Oh.

758
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:00,407
Our famous flying ace

759
01:22:00,408 --> 01:22:02,138
visiting our frontlines!

760
01:22:04,072 --> 01:22:06,694
Thank you for answering
my invitation.

761
01:22:07,268 --> 01:22:09,701
Quite a dornier sight from
down here, isn't it...

762
01:22:09,702 --> 01:22:10,871
...Richthofen.

763
01:22:12,744 --> 01:22:13,930
Your Majesty...

764
01:22:16,954 --> 01:22:18,017
Your Majesty!

765
01:22:18,224 --> 01:22:20,164
Aha... The little brother.

766
01:22:22,149 --> 01:22:24,901
You're looking desposed,
my dear Baron.

767
01:22:26,371 --> 01:22:27,420
Yes, your Majesty.

768
01:22:28,391 --> 01:22:29,342
I'm fine.

769
01:22:30,434 --> 01:22:31,669
I always am.

770
01:22:32,876 --> 01:22:35,013
Sometimes even irritated, sir.

771
01:22:37,377 --> 01:22:39,542
How can you be "irritably fine"?!

772
01:22:40,735 --> 01:22:42,170
It happens out here.

773
01:22:44,189 --> 01:22:45,434
We kill a couple of men.

774
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:48,625
And while they fall down in flames,
we feel just fine.

775
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:51,202
I find this irritating.

776
01:22:59,605 --> 01:23:03,560
My soldiers, do not...

777
01:23:04,046 --> 01:23:05,624
kill people.

778
01:23:06,661 --> 01:23:08,528
They simply destroyed the enemy.

779
01:23:09,589 --> 01:23:10,809
Well,

780
01:23:11,044 --> 01:23:12,949
the effects seems to be the same.

781
01:23:26,264 --> 01:23:27,358
Yes, Mentzke?

782
01:23:27,965 --> 01:23:29,277
You have a visitor, sir.

783
01:23:36,530 --> 01:23:38,152
I thought you might want
to celebrate.

784
01:23:46,054 --> 01:23:47,403
They published your book!

785
01:23:51,552 --> 01:23:53,342
The whole of Europe is reading it.

786
01:23:54,641 --> 01:23:55,624
So...

787
01:23:55,955 --> 01:23:57,855
How about dinner

788
01:23:58,392 --> 01:23:59,684
and then a dance?

789
01:24:00,497 --> 01:24:02,073
They shut down the "Metropole."

790
01:24:02,307 --> 01:24:03,795
Yes, I know.

791
01:24:03,796 --> 01:24:05,949
A British bomb hit the kitchen.

792
01:24:10,965 --> 01:24:12,113
Damn those English!

793
01:24:12,262 --> 01:24:14,077
They won't be happy till
all of Europe foods

794
01:24:14,078 --> 01:24:15,892
is as horrible as theirs.

795
01:24:31,394 --> 01:24:32,778
They don't want me to fly anymore.

796
01:24:36,551 --> 01:24:39,259
They're doing everything they can to
make me stay back on the ground.

797
01:24:40,636 --> 01:24:41,488
Really?

798
01:24:46,278 --> 01:24:47,854
They want me to command the
entire airforce,

799
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:50,553
the emperor himself.

800
01:24:52,304 --> 01:24:53,858
That's so wonderful!

801
01:24:55,177 --> 01:24:57,140
So many times I woke up in
the middle of the night,

802
01:24:58,234 --> 01:24:58,552
and read...

803
01:24:58,553 --> 01:25:00,553
the lists of missing pilots.

804
01:25:05,378 --> 01:25:07,615
It is so good to have you down here.

805
01:25:08,552 --> 01:25:09,632
Safe!

806
01:25:21,193 --> 01:25:21,980
Good!

807
01:25:35,943 --> 01:25:38,160
Your dancing has improved.

808
01:25:42,225 --> 01:25:44,201
I have a lot of times to
do this anyway.

809
01:26:01,771 --> 01:26:03,597
- <i>Good evening, men.</i>
- <i>Good evening, sir.</i>

810
01:26:03,598 --> 01:26:05,242
- <i>Bloody freezing, huh?</i>
- <i>So true, sir.</i>

811
01:26:11,947 --> 01:26:13,441
A brand new Bentley.

812
01:26:14,848 --> 01:26:16,115
Where did you get it?

813
01:26:17,365 --> 01:26:19,104
Bentleys don't fall out of the sky.

814
01:26:19,276 --> 01:26:21,676
Trust me, I've to argue a little
with the chap.

815
01:26:47,469 --> 01:26:49,248
You always wanted to be first
of the Aces.

816
01:26:50,115 --> 01:26:51,941
Now they offer it to you
and you hesistate.

817
01:26:52,935 --> 01:26:53,688
Yes...

818
01:26:56,043 --> 01:26:57,391
I always wanted to be like him.

819
01:27:01,008 --> 01:27:01,776
Werner...

820
01:27:05,797 --> 01:27:07,449
Could you ever give up flying?

821
01:27:10,248 --> 01:27:11,298
I don't think so.

822
01:27:13,277 --> 01:27:14,842
But if you ask my advice...

823
01:27:15,572 --> 01:27:16,882
You should grabbed your chance.

824
01:27:18,369 --> 01:27:19,598
You only want me to stop,

825
01:27:19,599 --> 01:27:21,304
so you can be first.

826
01:27:21,803 --> 01:27:23,330
I'll let you find out.

827
01:27:24,986 --> 01:27:27,014
Alright... Alright.

828
01:27:27,886 --> 01:27:29,249
- I'll stopped...
- Good.

829
01:27:30,178 --> 01:27:31,617
If you stop first.

830
01:27:33,407 --> 01:27:34,344
I don't think so.

831
01:27:34,345 --> 01:27:35,866
I am married to my plane.

832
01:27:36,276 --> 01:27:38,304
This is how I spend my spare time.

833
01:27:48,776 --> 01:27:50,907
These are fine planes you're
building us, Fokker.

834
01:27:51,831 --> 01:27:53,221
- The best.
- Yes, thank you.

835
01:27:53,921 --> 01:27:58,899
And yet somehow our own pilots seem
to think they can do better.

836
01:28:00,210 --> 01:28:01,127
Oh well...

837
01:28:01,658 --> 01:28:03,927
We sometimes modified
the plane a little.

838
01:28:04,797 --> 01:28:06,627
- Here and there.
- Modifications is one thing,

839
01:28:06,628 --> 01:28:09,797
...but replacing our engines with
those from enemy planes...

840
01:28:09,897 --> 01:28:11,897
- How did you hear of this?
- Early this morning

841
01:28:11,898 --> 01:28:13,830
we received a report of the recovery

842
01:28:14,412 --> 01:28:15,481
of a new triplane.

843
01:28:17,075 --> 01:28:17,675
Well...

844
01:28:17,685 --> 01:28:20,515
The Brits were less than
amused to find

845
01:28:20,516 --> 01:28:24,356
one of their own Bentley engine's in
a Fokker, they shot down.

846
01:28:28,295 --> 01:28:30,302
- I need to see it.
- Of course.

847
01:28:30,312 --> 01:28:31,600
I need to see it at once.

848
01:28:31,601 --> 01:28:34,094
Get me the damn report, now!

849
01:29:14,149 --> 01:29:15,624
Just three more weeks, Manfred.

850
01:29:16,163 --> 01:29:17,861
I already had my marching orders.

851
01:29:18,076 --> 01:29:19,598
I'm going to join your combat wing.

852
01:29:21,732 --> 01:29:23,593
What's become of him?

853
01:29:24,658 --> 01:29:26,062
Fallen in combat.

854
01:29:30,162 --> 01:29:31,359
And him,

855
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:32,630
his name is Voss, right?

856
01:29:39,276 --> 01:29:40,356
They are all dead.

857
01:29:49,526 --> 01:29:51,302
I will fight with you and Lothar!

858
01:29:51,542 --> 01:29:53,506
Our big offensive is in
full preparation.

859
01:29:53,903 --> 01:29:55,212
They called it "Operation Michael."

860
01:29:56,344 --> 01:29:57,688
We will win this war, won't we?

861
01:29:58,072 --> 01:29:59,360
Wolfram, please...

862
01:29:59,907 --> 01:30:01,044
It's alright, father.

863
01:30:01,045 --> 01:30:01,722
Of course we'll win.

864
01:30:02,419 --> 01:30:04,635
The Allies don't have a clue about
what's coming at them.

865
01:30:09,447 --> 01:30:11,013
For weeks we've been flying out,

866
01:30:11,525 --> 01:30:13,090
and decepting their reconnaissances.

867
01:30:13,511 --> 01:30:15,511
Keeping them from finding out
where we'll breakthrough.

868
01:30:17,056 --> 01:30:18,798
And we did a bloody good job.

869
01:30:20,901 --> 01:30:22,906
This offensive is going to push them
back into the channel.

870
01:30:45,870 --> 01:30:46,370
Sir!

871
01:30:47,795 --> 01:30:48,535
Morning, sir!

872
01:30:55,315 --> 01:30:55,970
Please...

873
01:30:55,971 --> 01:30:57,056
Follow us, sir.

874
01:31:09,011 --> 01:31:10,065
Take cover!

875
01:31:36,906 --> 01:31:38,400
What an unexpected surprise!

876
01:31:40,655 --> 01:31:43,075
You came to visit another
British defeat, captain.

877
01:31:45,267 --> 01:31:46,032
Lieutenant,

878
01:31:46,305 --> 01:31:48,286
go and see if you could find
somebody with a camera.

879
01:31:49,081 --> 01:31:51,984
It's excellent propaganda and
makes a very good picture.

880
01:31:52,604 --> 01:31:54,920
We have our flying ace down
here with us,

881
01:31:55,636 --> 01:31:56,846
on this victorious day.

882
01:31:58,199 --> 01:31:59,419
Your excellency,

883
01:31:59,420 --> 01:32:00,668
we need to talk.

884
01:32:04,144 --> 01:32:05,264
You don't want me down here.

885
01:32:07,054 --> 01:32:09,420
If you give me the power to make
strategic decisions,

886
01:32:10,004 --> 01:32:11,324
you won't have like them.

887
01:32:13,845 --> 01:32:15,087
Why wouldn't we?

888
01:32:16,198 --> 01:32:18,706
We very much trust your
abilities, Baron.

889
01:32:19,306 --> 01:32:20,868
I suggest we surrender!

890
01:32:20,968 --> 01:32:22,524
Huh... What arrogances...

891
01:32:23,589 --> 01:32:25,645
What a pompous child you are!

892
01:32:25,646 --> 01:32:26,946
I was victor...

893
01:32:26,956 --> 01:32:29,024
in 63 aerial battles.

894
01:32:29,906 --> 01:32:30,749
You know how I did it?

895
01:32:32,138 --> 01:32:33,459
When I faced a battle I couldn't win,

896
01:32:34,310 --> 01:32:35,106
I flew away.

897
01:32:36,884 --> 01:32:39,481
What makes you think we cannot
win this war?

898
01:32:40,062 --> 01:32:41,576
What about our boys?

899
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:43,650
Our holy cause...

900
01:32:43,982 --> 01:32:45,591
Our soldiers out in the field...

901
01:32:46,010 --> 01:32:48,381
You want to give all our efforts
to the enemy...

902
01:32:48,619 --> 01:32:49,819
...von Richthofen!

903
01:32:52,156 --> 01:32:53,281
French...

904
01:32:55,197 --> 01:32:56,885
Great cigarettes.

905
01:32:59,499 --> 01:33:01,312
What makes us think

906
01:33:01,746 --> 01:33:03,502
our causes is better than the French,

907
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:06,727
or the British and the Americans?

908
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:08,908
It isn't!

909
01:33:10,907 --> 01:33:12,931
It's not even difference from theirs.

910
01:33:13,571 --> 01:33:15,662
We just need an excuse for
what we do because

911
01:33:15,672 --> 01:33:16,694
without it

912
01:33:17,658 --> 01:33:18,977
we would see who we really are.

913
01:33:25,104 --> 01:33:27,367
Put this fool back into
his aeroplane,

914
01:33:29,196 --> 01:33:30,562
and give him a parachute.

915
01:33:31,778 --> 01:33:34,549
I can't afford to lose another
idealistic hero.

916
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:48,625
Operation Michael...

917
01:33:53,307 --> 01:33:55,760
Our ground forces attack on
both side of

918
01:33:55,761 --> 01:33:57,743
Socome town from here and from here.

919
01:33:58,232 --> 01:34:00,297
That's a 70 kilometers battleline.

920
01:34:00,298 --> 01:34:01,838
Right!

921
01:34:03,526 --> 01:34:04,338
Three armies...

922
01:34:06,022 --> 01:34:07,995
The 2nd army and 17th army

923
01:34:07,996 --> 01:34:09,654
are launching the offensive
from here.

924
01:34:10,356 --> 01:34:12,433
The 18th army will attack from here.

925
01:34:13,403 --> 01:34:15,248
Our task is to gain control of
the entire

926
01:34:15,249 --> 01:34:17,299
airspace and keeps it, my friends.

927
01:34:18,370 --> 01:34:20,527
Shouldn't be a problem should it,
Bodenschatz?

928
01:34:20,884 --> 01:34:23,049
Our planes are outnumber
4 to 1, Udet.

929
01:34:25,956 --> 01:34:28,043
We've lived with that for months
and weeks.

930
01:34:30,169 --> 01:34:31,666
It will be worse than ever.

931
01:34:34,351 --> 01:34:35,953
They'll send everything they've
got against us.

932
01:34:50,098 --> 01:34:50,927
<i>Fucking cold.</i>

933
01:35:40,479 --> 01:35:41,696
What the hell are you doing?

934
01:35:43,284 --> 01:35:44,806
Sorry if I have bother you, sir.

935
01:35:45,415 --> 01:35:47,502
What're you doing with my
brother's picture?

936
01:35:48,008 --> 01:35:49,356
He ordered me to take them down.

937
01:35:50,683 --> 01:35:51,662
All of them.

938
01:35:53,138 --> 01:35:53,959
Sir!

939
01:36:04,504 --> 01:36:05,731
<i>Move out!</i>

940
01:38:17,082 --> 01:38:18,367
May God be with us.

941
01:38:30,892 --> 01:38:31,851
Gentlemen...

942
01:38:34,397 --> 01:38:35,123
Let's go!

943
01:38:55,490 --> 01:38:56,272
<i>Contact!</i>

944
01:38:57,932 --> 01:38:58,619
<i>Contact!</i>

945
01:38:59,193 --> 01:38:59,916
<i>Contact!</i>

946
01:42:59,098 --> 01:43:01,128
He's really back, isn't he?

947
01:43:02,936 --> 01:43:05,933
His 'Flying Circus' swept the
British from the skies!

948
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:08,219
I saw him fly past,

949
01:43:09,266 --> 01:43:10,498
waving at us.

950
01:43:36,247 --> 01:43:36,936
Sir!

951
01:43:47,143 --> 01:43:48,014
Gentlemen!

952
01:43:49,830 --> 01:43:53,322
High Command of the Northern sector
thanks us for our accomplishments.

953
01:43:54,436 --> 01:43:56,434
I want to add my thanks.

954
01:43:56,787 --> 01:43:58,590
You've show me some splendid flying.

955
01:43:58,908 --> 01:43:59,703
Thank you.

956
01:44:00,408 --> 01:44:01,806
<i>Bravo! Hear! Hear!</i>

957
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,105
<i>Thank you captain!</i>

958
01:44:51,571 --> 01:44:54,536
This isn't how you imagine your
famous cousin to be, is it?

959
01:44:57,363 --> 01:44:59,486
The glorious captain that you
often saw photograph.

960
01:45:00,908 --> 01:45:02,540
Fatherland greatest hero.

961
01:45:03,359 --> 01:45:05,584
The first of all the aces who
shot down 80.

962
01:45:07,621 --> 01:45:09,447
Nobody ever down that many.

963
01:45:11,342 --> 01:45:12,907
I am really proud to be his brother.

964
01:45:18,780 --> 01:45:20,954
You can't beat family, Udet.

965
01:45:23,058 --> 01:45:24,808
Peace? Peace!

966
01:45:56,888 --> 01:45:57,955
Is that one of yours?

967
01:46:00,641 --> 01:46:01,728
I can't tell anymore.

968
01:46:03,558 --> 01:46:04,779
You're flying again, ain't you?

969
01:46:08,238 --> 01:46:09,435
Why didn't you tell me?

970
01:46:10,623 --> 01:46:12,428
Why did you lie to me again?

971
01:46:32,612 --> 01:46:33,801
I didn't want to scare you.

972
01:46:34,262 --> 01:46:35,610
I wanted you to be happy.

973
01:46:36,921 --> 01:46:38,999
Kate, I just cannot do what
they asked me.

974
01:46:39,532 --> 01:46:41,074
They offered you safety,

975
01:46:41,715 --> 01:46:42,684
your life.

976
01:46:48,623 --> 01:46:49,753
When I was a little boy...

977
01:46:51,058 --> 01:46:53,362
I could hit all the targets
with my father's rifle.

978
01:46:55,817 --> 01:46:58,051
Targets so faraway the others
couldn't even see them.

979
01:47:00,082 --> 01:47:02,208
I dreamed of seeing everything.

980
01:47:02,574 --> 01:47:03,809
Trying to think like a bird.

981
01:47:04,969 --> 01:47:05,771
Hawk eyes!

982
01:47:06,829 --> 01:47:08,137
"Eagle eyes" I was called.

983
01:47:10,186 --> 01:47:11,389
When I became a pilot,

984
01:47:12,831 --> 01:47:15,222
I truly thought I had see everything
from up there.

985
01:47:17,625 --> 01:47:18,873
I saw nothing.

986
01:47:19,858 --> 01:47:22,013
I was blind before I met you.

987
01:47:23,558 --> 01:47:24,895
You opened my eyes.

988
01:47:26,058 --> 01:47:27,872
You thought me to see what
I didn't want to see.

989
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:31,719
We all choose to fly.

990
01:47:32,656 --> 01:47:34,622
Voss, Sternberg...

991
01:47:34,623 --> 01:47:36,420
Lehmann, Wolff...

992
01:47:36,421 --> 01:47:38,096
Hawker.

993
01:47:39,013 --> 01:47:41,453
On whatever side we fought,
we all knew the risks we took.

994
01:47:45,183 --> 01:47:46,547
I wanted to be the best,

995
01:47:48,117 --> 01:47:49,856
I wanted to win and I thought I won.

996
01:47:50,219 --> 01:47:51,940
But I can see now, Kate...
I have seen.

997
01:47:51,980 --> 01:47:54,378
That we have turn the world into
a damn slaughter house.

998
01:47:54,379 --> 01:47:56,498
And I'm already too big a part of it.

999
01:47:58,093 --> 01:48:00,755
They're using my photograph,
to give hope

1000
01:48:00,756 --> 01:48:01,327
where there is none.

1001
01:48:02,362 --> 01:48:04,020
They used my name to
feign immortality,

1002
01:48:04,576 --> 01:48:05,403
where else in reality,

1003
01:48:05,404 --> 01:48:06,744
there is annihilation.

1004
01:48:08,159 --> 01:48:09,761
You said it yourself,

1005
01:48:10,128 --> 01:48:12,005
<i>"The men dying out there,
they have no choice."</i>

1006
01:48:12,266 --> 01:48:13,178
I have!

1007
01:48:13,676 --> 01:48:15,406
I cannot order them into battle.

1008
01:48:16,391 --> 01:48:18,031
I can perhaps leads them.

1009
01:48:18,032 --> 01:48:19,110
Help them!

1010
01:48:19,111 --> 01:48:20,236
Die with them,

1011
01:48:20,237 --> 01:48:22,783
but I will not betrayed them nor
keep the truth from them

1012
01:48:22,784 --> 01:48:25,236
by remaining the immortal
God's Berlin wants me to be.

1013
01:48:31,041 --> 01:48:31,800
You...

1014
01:48:32,513 --> 01:48:33,951
...are my greatest victory.

1015
01:48:54,289 --> 01:48:55,689
Sir?

1016
01:48:57,734 --> 01:48:58,813
Excuse me, sir.

1017
01:49:00,594 --> 01:49:01,512
Sir...

1018
01:49:04,314 --> 01:49:07,578
Sir... British aeroplanes are
approaching the front, sir.

1019
01:49:08,235 --> 01:49:08,888
Thank you.

1020
01:49:10,138 --> 01:49:10,797
Sir.

1021
01:49:31,046 --> 01:49:32,076
Yes, thank you!

1022
01:49:40,077 --> 01:49:41,968
They were last reported
at Lagnycourt.

1023
01:49:42,724 --> 01:49:43,928
So...

1024
01:49:43,929 --> 01:49:45,499
They are coming in from
the Northwest.

1025
01:49:46,662 --> 01:49:47,654
Thank you.

1026
01:49:48,563 --> 01:49:49,600
Brother.

1027
01:49:49,601 --> 01:49:52,144
You don't mind if I lead No:11 and
you fly on my right?

1028
01:49:52,813 --> 01:49:53,974
Be my guest.

1029
01:49:54,665 --> 01:49:55,387
Wolfram...

1030
01:49:56,514 --> 01:49:58,123
Stayed clear of any involvement.

1031
01:49:58,640 --> 01:49:59,764
Keep close to Lothar.

1032
01:50:00,252 --> 01:50:02,341
If you are attacked,
break off and fly home!

1033
01:50:02,389 --> 01:50:03,347
Fast!

1034
01:50:04,887 --> 01:50:06,800
It's a thin line between cowardice
and cleverness.

1035
01:50:24,529 --> 01:50:25,733
A great day to fly.

1036
01:50:29,591 --> 01:50:30,982
You are a brave man, Baron.

1037
01:50:36,889 --> 01:50:38,250
A very brave man...

1038
01:51:44,186 --> 01:51:44,786
<i>Thank you!</i>

1039
01:52:48,035 --> 01:52:48,702
<i>Contact!</i>

1040
01:53:00,186 --> 01:53:00,686
<i>Contact!</i>

1041
01:53:15,546 --> 01:53:16,226
<i>Contact!</i>

1042
01:53:29,091 --> 01:53:29,691
<i>Contact!</i>

1043
01:54:33,203 --> 01:54:33,848
Thank you.

1044
01:54:34,189 --> 01:54:35,234
You are welcome.

1045
01:54:36,922 --> 01:54:38,055
Miss...

1046
01:55:25,834 --> 01:55:27,564
I could not come sooner.

1047
01:55:29,244 --> 01:55:32,250
It's not so easy to cross the line
into British territory.

1048
01:55:36,127 --> 01:55:38,093
Finally a friend of ours help me.

1049
01:55:42,703 --> 01:55:44,964
He asked me why it was important
for me to come here?

1050
01:55:47,938 --> 01:55:49,425
I told him I love you.

1051
01:55:53,127 --> 01:55:55,178
Did I ever tell you?
