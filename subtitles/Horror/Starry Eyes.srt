1
00:01:12,998 --> 00:01:16,243
Hi, welcome to Big Taters.
My name is Sarah.

2
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:19,144
Can I start you guys off
with an order of our freedom tops?

3
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,058
Sarah, you know the rule
about cell phones.

4
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:33,460
I'm sorry. I just... I was
just checking on something.

5
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,827
Yeah, well check it on your break.

6
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,404
Mario, where has she
been hiding that thing?

7
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:58,485
Put the car in drive, Charlie.

8
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:02,322
You're here for one reason
and one reason only

9
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,791
because...

10
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,458
You know the lines. Keep your eyes up.

11
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,633
I stopped going to church when I was 16.

12
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:16,334
- So I don't...
- Up, up, up.

13
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:27,174
I really haven't been able
to take my eyes off of Erin.

14
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:30,943
The word on the street there's
a rumor going around that she's...

15
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:34,815
...bicycle but sadly
I'm sitting here realizing

16
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:36,616
that I've never gone to take a ride...

17
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,485
Oh, hi, how are you? Good to see you.

18
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:41,805
- Hey, Sarah. Nice to see you.
- Hello. How's it going?

19
00:03:41,906 --> 00:03:43,390
- I'm glad you came.
- Fine. Yeah.

20
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:47,561
And I'm glad you brought
your wonderful roommate.

21
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:51,262
- Suck it, Danny.
- I said you were wonderful.

22
00:03:55,902 --> 00:04:00,507
- You coming?
- Hey, I honestly don't know what it is.

23
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,843
Oh, don't be coy. You're coming.

24
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:05,512
Yeah, come, and I'll tell you
all about my new project.

25
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,582
Yeah, it's really good. We've been
working on it for like the last two,

26
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:10,476
- three months now.
- Cool.

27
00:04:10,577 --> 00:04:13,286
I'm playing Simone. She has the
best lines in the whole thing.

28
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:19,426
I've been writing it and Erin has been
providing some very insightful feedback.

29
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:22,329
I am honestly actually kind
of surprised to see you here.

30
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,497
- I thought you were avoiding me.
- Erin.

31
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:28,399
- Why would you think that?
- Because I "stole your role."

32
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,906
Okay, Danny do you want
to help me in the kitchen?

33
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,074
Yeah.

34
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:37,510
- I'm kidding, Sarah. Don't worry.
- Okay.

35
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,981
I didn't even know that you auditioned
for it and it was just a stupid commercial.

36
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,283
Honestly, it was kind of a
horrible experience anyway.

37
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:47,255
The director was a total perv and you
should be glad that you didn't get it.

38
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:49,890
- Okay.
- I'm going to get a drink.

39
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,957
- Sarah?
- Yeah.

40
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,592
Oh, my God, Sarah.

41
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,361
- Did you do something with your hair?
- No.

42
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,730
Are you coming to Performation?
You totally have to.

43
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,966
- Everyone's going to perform something.
- Oh, perform?

44
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:03,768
Yeah, we'll finally get to see these acting
chops that we've heard so much about.

45
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,072
Okay.

46
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,942
I like your shoes, Sarah.

47
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:15,215
...I'm no ginko but I am Poe.

48
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,278
The Rosebowl's got a table of them.
Hey I had to find the film

49
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:20,320
- but it works great.
- Oh.

50
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,788
- Here, check this out.
- Oh.

51
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,423
- That's sexy right?
- Yeah.

52
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:27,091
Danny and I are making a dark room
so we can do all the processing.

53
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:29,162
That's cool.

54
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,519
Well, we were going to do a gallery
show but it's just so much easier

55
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,767
to put that shit on Instagram.
It's just a way bigger audience.

56
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:40,006
Are you kidding me?
Beer on my butt.

57
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:42,340
- Are you okay?
- Dudes, don't.

58
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:47,178
Nip slip.

59
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:16,774
Sarah.

60
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:21,581
- Hey, Sarah, hey you alright?
- Yeah. Yeah.

61
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:24,985
Hey listen, so about this script
that we were talking about earlier,

62
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:28,655
I was wondering maybe you and
I could get together sometime and...

63
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:31,224
Oh, my God.

64
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:35,428
- What's going on?
- Oh, this ad for a role.

65
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,521
- They just called me in for an audition.
- What? Really?

66
00:06:37,622 --> 00:06:39,087
- That's great. Congratulations.
- No, way, cool.

67
00:06:39,187 --> 00:06:40,133
- That's cool.
- Thank you.

68
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,135
What is the role for?

69
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,338
It's this movie called
The Silver Scream.

70
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:48,706
Oh, my God.
I hope that's a working title.

71
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,743
- What?
- It's really cool.

72
00:06:59,115 --> 00:07:03,987
Chloe did not get fed up
and just take off.

73
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:07,728
She's not out on another one of her,

74
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:10,597
benders.

75
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:13,133
She's not out on another
one of her benders.

76
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:15,268
Something happened to her.

77
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:19,907
I, I went to her...

78
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,406
I... I...

79
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:27,679
I went over to her trailer and I...

80
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,218
Sorry.

81
00:07:33,318 --> 00:07:36,824
I, I went to...

82
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:39,427
I...

83
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,094
I went to...

84
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:45,930
I...

85
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,407
Oh, oh, God.

86
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:05,449
I'm... I'm...

87
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,062
Sarah Walker.

88
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,802
I'm Sarah Walker.

89
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,943
I'm Sarah Walker.

90
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:06,010
Hi, Sarah.

91
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,282
I brought a headshot.

92
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,719
That won't be necessary.
We have your digital file.

93
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:17,087
Yeah, of course. I just thought
you might want a hard copy.

94
00:09:22,027 --> 00:09:25,932
What you do in this room right now
will render that headshot null and void.

95
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:31,471
When you exit this room you will
either have made a lasting impression

96
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:37,209
or blend into the sea of thousands of
forgotten girls who pass through these halls

97
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,009
every day.

98
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:48,052
A photograph won't change that.

99
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:55,195
Okay.

100
00:09:55,995 --> 00:10:00,266
Well, hopefully you'll see something in me
because I know I'd be great for this.

101
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:05,806
I grew up on scary movies
and I'm an actor obviously.

102
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:10,477
So I, I think I'd be pretty good.

103
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:14,581
Don't tell us, Sarah. Show us.

104
00:10:36,862 --> 00:10:39,432
Chloe didn't get fed up
with the shoot and just take off.

105
00:10:39,532 --> 00:10:41,033
She's not out there
on one of her benders.

106
00:10:41,133 --> 00:10:43,703
- Something happened to her.
- Happened to her, like what?

107
00:10:43,803 --> 00:10:47,973
I went to her trailer after everyone said
that she took off and I found this.

108
00:10:48,073 --> 00:10:51,644
- And?
- Her dad gave her this, Chaz.

109
00:10:51,744 --> 00:10:54,146
On the morning of her birthday
before he left for work

110
00:10:54,246 --> 00:10:56,823
- when he still lived in Long Island.
- So?

111
00:10:56,923 --> 00:11:01,494
So her birthday is September 11. Her dad
died that morning in the World Trade Center.

112
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,476
She would never leave without this.

113
00:11:03,577 --> 00:11:06,099
- No way, not ever.
- Okay, so she wouldn't leave without it.

114
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,966
I mean, that still doesn't mean
something happened.

115
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:13,729
Well, that's not all.
When I was in her trailer

116
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:17,543
I-I heard a shuffling and then I saw
something out of the corner of my eye.

117
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:20,013
Don't say it. Don't tell me you're
believing these stories now too.

118
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:22,148
I turned. I saw her, Chaz.

119
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,750
- Saw who?
- Chloe.

120
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,819
So she's still here.

121
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,862
It was her...

122
00:11:30,563 --> 00:11:32,522
only it wasn't.

123
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:40,331
- Thank you, Sarah.
- No problem.

124
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,167
We'll be in touch.

125
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,941
Okay.

126
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,648
Do you have any notes for me?

127
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:58,351
I can do it again, different if
you didn't like what you saw.

128
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,419
We saw what we needed, Sarah. Thank you.

129
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,917
Fuck. Fuck. God. Fuck.

130
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:48,368
Fuck!

131
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:50,468
God!

132
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:07,378
Maybe we didn't see all
we needed from you after all.

133
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:13,619
What was that you were doing
in the washroom, Sarah?

134
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,222
What?

135
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,088
Your fit.

136
00:14:20,357 --> 00:14:23,494
That... that was nothing.

137
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,667
Sarah, you have my attention.

138
00:14:35,371 --> 00:14:39,513
- I was disappointed in myself.
- So you punished yourself.

139
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:44,817
No, I don't... It's just something
I do. I don't know.

140
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:49,589
Would you do it again, for us, now?

141
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:54,727
- What?
- I want to see your fit, Sarah.

142
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:57,930
I've never done that in
front of anyone before.

143
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,431
Alright then, thank you for coming in.

144
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:33,624
Thank you, Sarah. We'll be in touch.

145
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,371
Hey, how'd it go?

146
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,677
How did the audition go? What happened?

147
00:17:25,777 --> 00:17:29,949
Not good. I think they made fun of me.

148
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,951
What?

149
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,320
I don't really want to
talk about it right now.

150
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,122
Okay, well, hey,
everyone's coming by in a little bit.

151
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,358
You should come hang out with us.

152
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:43,994
I kind of want to be alone. Thanks.

153
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,063
Our little tater tot
full of birthing cheer,

154
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:22,165
our little tater tot
has lived another year.

155
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,836
I love birthdays.

156
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,544
Again with the phone, Sarah?
Am I going to have to start frisking you?

157
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:42,054
David, what are you doing
standing there staring at me?

158
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:45,991
I told you to go defrost
those chicken strips like an hour ago.

159
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,827
They're like a block of ice.

160
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,327
Jesus Christ.

161
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:55,668
Hi, this is Sarah Walker calling you back.
You just called me.

162
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:58,637
Hello Sarah. Yes, we tried to call...

163
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:00,416
Yes, yeah, I'm so sorry about that.

164
00:19:00,517 --> 00:19:03,309
- I was...
- Please don't cut me off, Sarah.

165
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,143
We'd like to see you again.

166
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:11,917
Yes, yeah, yeah, I would...
I would love to come in again.

167
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:14,820
Great. I'll e-mail you the details.

168
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,224
And Sarah, this will be
different from the last time.

169
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:23,794
Oh, well good because I only
have so much hair on my head.

170
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,344
Well, thank you. Thank you so much

171
00:19:29,445 --> 00:19:32,969
- and I'm sorry that I cut you off...
- Yeah.

172
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,183
Jeez.

173
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,556
What's going on with you lately?

174
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:53,659
Listen, Sarah,

175
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,128
Tater's girls are all family.

176
00:19:56,228 --> 00:20:01,468
So, if one of you isn't on the ball
then that affects the whole family.

177
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:06,706
You would never want to hurt
your family now, would you, Sarah?

178
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:11,744
- I don't really have a family, Carl.
- I'm talking about your Big Tater's family,

179
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:16,315
the phone thing, all these
auditions that you're going on.

180
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:21,520
I know it's important to you but...
this is your job.

181
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,054
You got to prioritize.

182
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:31,161
- Yeah, maybe you're right.
- I know that I am.

183
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:35,365
I think I may have to quit.

184
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:41,290
No, I don't... You didn't understand
what I was trying to say.

185
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:46,454
This job is getting in the way, Carl.
I have a talent,

186
00:20:47,055 --> 00:20:50,649
a real talent and I'm not going
to take that for granted anymore.

187
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:55,120
Now that's... You... You're twisting my
words around and that's not what I meant.

188
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,891
Let me... Let's... Let's start over.

189
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,827
You have a gift. No.

190
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,163
This. This place.

191
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:11,001
Sarah, there are a million other girls
who would beg for a steady job like this.

192
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:16,740
I am not a million other girls.

193
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,098
You can go right in.

194
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,371
Close the door behind you.

195
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:58,214
Step forward please.

196
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:03,686
Stand right on that pink mark.

197
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:07,891
It's so dark.

198
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:14,631
Lower your hand.

199
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:20,072
Thank you for seeing us again, Sarah.

200
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,442
Of course, yeah,
this is my top priority.

201
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:27,913
Today we'd like to try
something different with you.

202
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:31,183
Of course. Sure, I...
I didn't get any...

203
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:35,154
- Would you mind disrobing for us?
- Excuse me?

204
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:39,389
Would you mind disrobing, please?

205
00:22:42,926 --> 00:22:47,900
The ad didn't say anything about nudity.
Does the role call for that?

206
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,102
It doesn't.

207
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:53,939
Sarah, you've already proven
that you can memorize lines.

208
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:58,444
Now we need to see you bare.
Let your inhibitions go.

209
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,079
Didn't I do that last time?

210
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:06,716
That's the reason you're here Sarah,
the only reason you got a call back.

211
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:10,422
Sarah, you know who we are.

212
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:13,290
You know the pictures we've made, yes?

213
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:04,174
Completely, Sarah.

214
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:42,078
It's okay, Sarah. I told you
this would be different.

215
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,552
Sarah,

216
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:49,619
relax yourself.

217
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,261
Sarah, if you can't
fully let yourself go,

218
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:59,429
how can you ever transform
into something else?

219
00:25:57,255 --> 00:26:01,758
That's what we were
looking for, Sarah. Thank you.

220
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:37,827
Okay, okay. Here we go.

221
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:40,930
One, two, three.

222
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:45,270
If I have to take one more goddamn
photo of you two idiots jumping,

223
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,337
I swear to God I'm going to kill myself.

224
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,948
- Hey, Sarah.
- Hey.

225
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:57,116
Hey, how'd it go?

226
00:26:57,216 --> 00:27:01,953
- Tracy told us that you had a callback.
- Oh, yeah, they wanted to see me again.

227
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:05,255
Yeah, I read the ad.
The role seemed a little silly though.

228
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:10,162
Yeah, but it's Astreus Pictures
so it's legit.

229
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:13,665
It's Astreus? Wow, that is legit.
They're the real deal.

230
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:16,001
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Good job.

231
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:19,171
Don't you think it's kind
of a long shot, though?

232
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,007
What's Extra, Extraneous...?

233
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:24,276
- Astre... Astreus Pictures.
- Astreus. It's stupid.

234
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:27,179
They're a production company.
They've been around forever.

235
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:31,783
Fell off a little last few years
but they're coming back?

236
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:34,352
Maybe you can put in
a word with production,

237
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:36,588
get a little PA work or something?

238
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:40,990
- What about our film?
- We're still going to make our film.

239
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,896
Well, I haven't gotten
the role yet. So...

240
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:46,796
That's true.

241
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:56,975
- Oh, Trace.
- Hey. Hey.

242
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:59,211
- How'd it go?
- Great. I think it went great.

243
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:00,028
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

244
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:02,047
You didn't feel like they were
making fun of you this time?

245
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:05,283
No, you know what, I don't think they
were making fun of me the first time either.

246
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:07,553
- Oh, okay. Awesome.
- Yeah.

247
00:28:07,653 --> 00:28:09,488
- Anyway, I don't want to jinx it.
- Of course.

248
00:28:09,588 --> 00:28:10,739
- You and your superstitions.
- Yeah.

249
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:13,089
Hey, you should go throw on
a bathing suit and come join us.

250
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:14,860
Oh, shit.

251
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,859
Yo, Erin, Erin.

252
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,270
Shit.

253
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,038
Ashley, here.

254
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:30,774
Here, here. Here, you're okay.
You're okay. You're okay...

255
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:40,416
Sarah, if you can't really let yourself go
how can you transform into something else?

256
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:09,048
- Hello?
- I have some good news for you, Sarah.

257
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:11,683
He wants to meet you.

258
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:13,785
He, who?

259
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,952
The producer.

260
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:25,762
Oh, my God.

261
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:46,449
- ...this is your moment.
- Oh, man.

262
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:52,157
- I don't know what this is.
- Jesus Christ, can we not watch another one.

263
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:53,692
- Wait, wait, just...
- Do you know who wrote this?

264
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,327
Watch what he does.

265
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:58,330
I'm not trying to be rude
but this is fucking stupid.

266
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,365
Oh, yeah.

267
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,000
That guy rocks.

268
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,768
Do you know how many times I've
wanted to do that? It's crazy.

269
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:19,049
Wow.

270
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:23,788
- That's right, you have that thing.
- What thing?

271
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:26,956
She's got a meeting with the producer.

272
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:30,629
- At Astreus?
- Yeah.

273
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:32,764
I told you you'd get it.

274
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:35,133
Don't you think
you're a little overdressed?

275
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:38,370
- This? This is nothing.
- It's a little much.

276
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:42,939
Look, you look amazing.
Go kick some ass.

277
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:23,212
Just remember to be yourself in here.

278
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:42,598
Sarah,

279
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:47,870
- thank you for coming.
- Thank you for having me.

280
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:57,682
You're just as beautiful in person
as you are on the audition tapes.

281
00:31:57,782 --> 00:32:01,117
Thank you. I didn't realize
I was being taped.

282
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:05,356
Well, I am excited, Sarah.

283
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:09,928
We audition a lot of
young women in this building

284
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:14,232
but very, very few ever
make it to this room.

285
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:17,135
Wow, that's great.

286
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:20,371
Yes, we've had our share of winners,

287
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:24,776
some pretty big names have
passed right through here,

288
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:27,243
going way back.

289
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:33,551
So, did you like our little yarn?

290
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:36,855
Absolutely, I loved it.
I read it three times.

291
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:41,025
Good. I have high hopes
for this picture.

292
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:46,832
Yes. It's kind of my love letter
to this town.

293
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:53,371
Ambition, the blackest of human desires.

294
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:58,209
Everyone has it. But how many act on it?

295
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,278
That's what intrigues me.

296
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:04,449
That's what lights me up as they say.

297
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:07,185
There's something primal there

298
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:10,989
and that's why you're sitting
right here in this room.

299
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:15,727
- But I mean, it's a horror movie as well.
- Of course.

300
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:19,264
The two are not mutually exclusive.

301
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:24,902
This industry is a plague Sarah,
a plague of unoriginality,

302
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:28,339
hollow be thy name, shallow be thy name.

303
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:31,509
Yes, it's a plague alright.

304
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:35,547
And what does every
plague have a lot of?

305
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:37,782
- Rats?
- Precisely.

306
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:40,952
Yes, thousands of them,
hungry little rats,

307
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:43,087
hungry for the cheese.

308
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:47,192
You cut through the fog of this town

309
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:49,694
and you get desperation,

310
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:55,667
plastic parishioners worshiping
their deity of debauchery.

311
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:58,503
But that's what I find
interesting, Sarah.

312
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:02,807
That's what I want
to capture in this film,

313
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:07,445
the ugliness of the human spirit.

314
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:11,183
Yeah, okay, I mean, I can see that.

315
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:15,086
So why do you do it, darling?

316
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:17,956
Why, why do I do what?

317
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:21,757
Why do you pull your beautiful hair out?

318
00:34:26,962 --> 00:34:29,701
I... It's just a habit.

319
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:33,203
I started doing it
when I was a little girl and...

320
00:34:34,703 --> 00:34:37,609
it helps me focus on the moment.

321
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:39,811
The moment.

322
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:43,781
- Well, this is a moment.
- Yes, yes it is.

323
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:46,584
The role of Celeste is a really big deal

324
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:50,622
for a young actress with no
other credits to her name.

325
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:54,285
Your face will be on the poster.
The poster on a wall,

326
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:58,429
a wall in the lobby,
a lobby of a movie theater,

327
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:02,300
a theater with a marquee,

328
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,503
The Silver Scream.

329
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:09,841
Now you know that doesn't happen
very much anymore, right?

330
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:13,144
This is a great opportunity
for a young actress,

331
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:17,582
a great opportunity
for an actress with ambition.

332
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:23,087
That's me. I'm your girl. I will do
whatever it takes for this role.

333
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:27,759
Good, because we want
to offer it to you.

334
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:31,129
We think you could be great
in this role, Sarah.

335
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,996
I think you could be great in this role.

336
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:41,673
I agree. Truthfully,
I think I am this role.

337
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:47,312
I mean, this character has a dream
and she has so much potential.

338
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:51,182
Sarah, forget about all that.

339
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:54,652
This world is about the doers,

340
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,588
the people who don't just
talk about what they're going to do,

341
00:35:57,688 --> 00:36:01,424
they just do it. And that's you.

342
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:07,832
Thank you. Thank you for saying that.

343
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:11,336
I worked so hard, you know.

344
00:36:11,436 --> 00:36:13,571
Every week is a new class,

345
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:17,440
a new audition and I just never...

346
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:28,083
If you want me to...
to read more with...

347
00:36:28,984 --> 00:36:30,722
other actors,

348
00:36:33,422 --> 00:36:35,126
or another audition.

349
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:40,231
Sarah, this is the audition.

350
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:42,468
I told you before,

351
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:48,039
very, very few actresses
ever get to this room.

352
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:51,709
Sarah, you're at the gates.

353
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:56,314
All you need is for me
to open them for you.

354
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:59,450
I can make you a star, Sarah.

355
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,418
- You know I can.
- Whoa, no.

356
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,556
Let me out.

357
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:11,594
Let me out. Open the door.

358
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:38,890
How'd it go?

359
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,959
Not good.

360
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,862
- Maybe I should submit my headshot.
- Seriously.

361
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:46,664
I'm kidding.

362
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:48,900
- Are you all right?
- Oh, honey, I'm kidding.

363
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,066
Hey.

364
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:53,903
- Maybe you should...
- Yeah.

365
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:56,605
It was a fucking joke.

366
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:00,543
Coming in.

367
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:11,854
What are you doing? Hey,

368
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,926
don't cry, hun.

369
00:38:18,196 --> 00:38:20,131
What happened?

370
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:23,701
Everything was going so well.

371
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:27,038
I was so sure I was going to get it.

372
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:30,208
I quit my job for this.

373
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,710
You quit your job for this?

374
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:36,314
I was so sure. I was so sure.

375
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:40,084
Okay, wait a minute, what happened?

376
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:43,788
It was one final step

377
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:49,391
and I could have had it too
if I was just willing to...

378
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:54,363
Hun, willing to what?

379
00:38:57,235 --> 00:39:00,305
Come on, you don't...
You don't mean sex.

380
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:03,441
I mean, he didn't say specifically what.

381
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:06,377
Oh, my God.

382
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:08,379
Are you being serious?

383
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:12,751
What a fucking creep, okay.
Do people still even do that?

384
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,987
Well, no one out there does.

385
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,356
And I sure as heck don't.

386
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:22,025
And you don't. Okay?

387
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:27,698
- Okay?
- Okay. Okay.

388
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:29,566
Wait,

389
00:39:30,967 --> 00:39:34,539
you don't wish that you did it do you?

390
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,910
It was a gateway part.

391
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,979
Sarah, it was two auditions.

392
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,949
I mean, and seriously, who gets
hired for a lead role that quickly?

393
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,750
Doesn't that seem a
little suspicious to you?

394
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:54,725
Listen, Danny was just telling me how
badly he wants to have you in his movie.

395
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:56,127
You should talk to him.

396
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,559
Oh, shut up.

397
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:02,064
What are they up to now?

398
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:17,281
I can make you a star, Sarah.

399
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:20,015
You know I can.

400
00:40:27,692 --> 00:40:31,796
So I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.

401
00:40:32,796 --> 00:40:35,466
I know that you were trying to help me

402
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:39,337
and I twisted your words.

403
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:43,405
I twisted them and...

404
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:48,112
Look, Sarah, I get it.

405
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:52,183
Really, I do. I'm not an idiot.

406
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:54,717
I know what town we live in.

407
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:58,422
I mean, you think you're the
first waitress I've ever had

408
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:01,058
that was destined for stardom?
I've had my share.

409
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:03,394
But they all understood
that being a Taters girl

410
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:07,098
is what paid the bills
while they chased the dream.

411
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:11,567
Now I'm not sure you see
how the two are connected.

412
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:18,643
I mean, I don't know what
else you want me to say.

413
00:41:18,743 --> 00:41:22,246
Do you want me to beg for this job?

414
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:25,049
Well, you don't got to be a jerk about it.
I mean, I've already had like,

415
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:28,100
- 20 applications since you quit, so...
- I'm sorry. I didn't...

416
00:41:28,201 --> 00:41:30,289
I didn't mean it like that.

417
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:36,929
Look, I want you to see
this place for what it really is.

418
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:41,332
Yeah, I know you think it's cheesy.

419
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:44,602
Too self-aware,
not ironic enough for you,

420
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:48,205
the menus, the specials,
all those clever meal names,

421
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:50,041
calling the little kids tater tots,

422
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:54,378
saying see you later tater gator
when the customers are leaving.

423
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:58,683
That's all me. All right?

424
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:04,238
It may not be cool to a
young woman your age

425
00:42:04,339 --> 00:42:07,359
- but it's me.
- Okay.

426
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:10,770
Look, just...

427
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:14,865
promise me that until your star
is on the sidewalk out there

428
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:19,805
you'll try and value me
and what I'm trying to do here.

429
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:23,138
Can you...

430
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:26,475
Can you do that for me?

431
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:30,746
Are you a Taters girl?

432
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,050
Yeah, I can do that.

433
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:41,490
I'm a Taters girl.

434
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:04,448
I guess my point is that I just
feel like, the austerity lifestyles,

435
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:07,149
sort of eastern lifestyles exists...

436
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:15,059
I got no friends at my party.

437
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:18,629
Hey. Back to slumming it
like the rest of us?

438
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:20,195
Hey.

439
00:43:20,865 --> 00:43:22,266
Hey.

440
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:24,435
- What's up, Erin?
- Hi.

441
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:26,068
What's up?

442
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:29,805
Do you have like, an amp for that?

443
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:40,749
This is good.

444
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:44,938
Who knows how to scat?

445
00:43:45,038 --> 00:43:49,226
This is the issue with the millennial
generation. It's just, it's entitlement.

446
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:04,041
Hey, you get off my lawn.

447
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:07,578
It's my property you're sitting on.

448
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:11,049
You're loitering.
I could have you arrested.

449
00:44:11,549 --> 00:44:15,551
It's a crime. It's where I live.

450
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,890
- You live there?
- Yeah.

451
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,126
Why?

452
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:24,795
See, it's LA.

453
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:27,465
Why should I spend $1500
a month on an apartment

454
00:44:27,565 --> 00:44:31,402
when I'm just going to spend
all day in the car anyway?

455
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:35,672
- So this is your car too?
- It's my car. It doesn't run but...

456
00:44:35,772 --> 00:44:37,906
it did when I had that epiphany.

457
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:54,192
Tracy told us what happened.

458
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:57,561
Told you, told you what?

459
00:44:57,661 --> 00:45:03,632
That the producer at
Astreus got inappropriate.

460
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:09,838
Maybe it's worth it.

461
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,981
I just started back up
at Big Taters yesterday.

462
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:19,583
I kind of feel like
I'm selling my soul already.

463
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:23,285
So it may as well be
for something I love.

464
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:31,295
I don't know. If you want to do
what you love, why not just do it?

465
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:36,067
I mean, you work at this restaurant.
You work at Big Taters. I live in a van.

466
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:38,170
So what?

467
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:44,239
Those things aren't mutually exclusive from
us being able to do what we want to do.

468
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:49,648
We got all these people,
all our friends,

469
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:53,250
they're just sitting around
trying to figure out what to do,

470
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:56,387
trying to figure out how to make something.
Maybe we should be sitting around anymore.

471
00:45:56,487 --> 00:46:00,622
Maybe we should just get together
and make something.

472
00:46:04,662 --> 00:46:08,232
I'm going to send you my script.

473
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:11,199
You're going to dig it, trust me.

474
00:46:13,671 --> 00:46:17,339
And we'll work around your
precious Big Taters schedule.

475
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:23,915
You'd direct me?

476
00:46:24,415 --> 00:46:25,948
Yeah.

477
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:30,287
I'd be your leading lady?

478
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:31,889
I say rape, you say don't.

479
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:34,056
- Sure.
- Simone?

480
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:41,296
If you want.

481
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:46,935
Then, yeah.

482
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:52,307
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I'll be in your movie.

483
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:56,580
Alright, okay.

484
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,816
I've been trying to talk to you
about it for a week.

485
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:02,487
Fuck Astreus Pictures.
We're going to make our own movie.

486
00:47:03,087 --> 00:47:05,220
All right?

487
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:08,156
Do you have any champagne?

488
00:47:11,729 --> 00:47:13,261
Okay. Hold on.

489
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:29,878
What is it?

490
00:47:33,484 --> 00:47:36,318
It's the start of the night
we're never going to forget.

491
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,464
Three, two, one.

492
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:20,557
This world is about the doers,

493
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:25,830
the people who don't just talk about what
they're going to do, they just do it.

494
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:27,996
And that's you.

495
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:34,638
Astreus Pictures.

496
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:38,109
Hi, this is Sarah Walker calling.

497
00:49:38,609 --> 00:49:42,342
I made a mistake.
I never should have left that office.

498
00:49:45,616 --> 00:49:47,849
I want to meet him again.

499
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:07,802
582 Canyon Drive. Be there in one hour.

500
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,745
Come in, Sarah.

501
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:47,836
There won't be a third
opportunity, Sarah.

502
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:12,461
Your house is beautiful.

503
00:52:16,432 --> 00:52:19,601
Do you want me to read a scene?

504
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:30,078
Do you want to discuss
the role some more?

505
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:46,729
I'm sorry that I left
the other night. I'm...

506
00:52:47,129 --> 00:52:52,600
I'm... I... I really could
be great for this part.

507
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:59,443
Words, Sarah, just words.

508
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:04,181
What would you be willing
to do to convince me,

509
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:07,784
to make me believe in you again?

510
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:12,889
Would you forgo your eyes
for a new pair of eyes,

511
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:16,159
eyes that see with our vision?

512
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:19,129
Would you give up your body

513
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:23,166
to become a vessel for our voice,

514
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:26,003
for my voice?

515
00:53:26,103 --> 00:53:33,408
Will you give your old life away
for a glorious, new life?

516
00:53:36,579 --> 00:53:38,446
Yes.

517
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:42,517
Then show me.

518
00:54:28,899 --> 00:54:32,102
The gateway is opened, Sarah.

519
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:38,775
All you have to do is be willing
to step inside forever

520
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:41,943
and never look back.

521
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:45,985
Kill your old life, Sarah.

522
00:54:46,785 --> 00:54:49,893
Bury it in the earth

523
00:54:50,294 --> 00:54:54,858
and join us in the skies.

524
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:04,299
Show me the girl I thought you were.

525
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,309
Let me see the real, Sarah.

526
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,575
Sarah, order's up.

527
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:28,883
Oh, Jesus Christ, Sarah.

528
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,956
Go home. You shouldn't
be here right now.

529
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,559
No, no, it's... I'm fine. It's fine.

530
00:56:35,659 --> 00:56:40,096
It's not fine. What are you doing?
Come here. Come on. Come on.

531
00:56:40,196 --> 00:56:42,299
Come on, come on.
Give me it. Give me it.

532
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:45,233
Give me that. Give me it.
Give me it. Give me it.

533
00:56:54,678 --> 00:56:57,879
Get the fuck out of here
and don't come back.

534
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:09,891
Astreus Pictures.

535
00:57:10,827 --> 00:57:12,929
This is Sarah Walker calling.

536
00:57:16,829 --> 00:57:19,536
I'm not feeling very well.

537
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:22,405
I mean, I'm fine.

538
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:24,642
It's fine. I just...

539
00:57:25,742 --> 00:57:30,013
I don't... I don't know what's
happening right now.

540
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:34,115
So if someone could...

541
00:57:37,821 --> 00:57:42,059
If someone could please call me
back when you get this, please.

542
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:44,959
Thank you.

543
00:57:57,374 --> 00:57:58,973
Are you okay?

544
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:02,176
Are you alright?

545
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:08,051
Hey, Sarah, you alright?
Let me look at you. Come here.

546
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:11,486
Hey, are you okay? You alright, Sarah?

547
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:17,494
- Danny, get drunk with me.
- I'm alright right now, man.

548
00:58:17,594 --> 00:58:19,396
But I love you. I love you very much.

549
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:22,265
Suit yourself but we won't be able
to sneak booze into the bowl.

550
00:58:22,365 --> 00:58:27,404
It easy to sneak booze in. All you have
to do is flirt with the dude at the door.

551
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:30,671
Oh. Yeah, yeah, I'll give that a shot.

552
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,174
Dude.

553
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:36,179
She's going to Ralph.

554
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:38,515
Hey, I think maybe
we need to get her home.

555
00:58:38,615 --> 00:58:41,485
Get her like some water or something.

556
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:45,488
- Yo, Poe, put that away.
- No, no, no, this is golden.

557
00:58:45,588 --> 00:58:48,391
I'm going to make a Tumblr. It's going
to be called Sick, slutty Sarah, yeah.

558
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:50,827
No, you're not.
What the fuck are you thinking?

559
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:53,096
- Damn it, leave him alone.
- I love you. It's okay.

560
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,731
Give me my fucking phone!

561
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:56,230
- Whoa!
- Jesus.

562
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:01,235
Dude.

563
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:07,341
Sarah? What the...
I was trying to stop him. What...

564
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,613
- Okay, what...?
- Let's just keep it funny everybody.

565
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:11,781
- Relax.
- Am I the bad guy now?

566
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:14,684
- Why are you defending her, Danny?
- Go after her. She's sick.

567
00:59:14,784 --> 00:59:16,586
Sarah, you shouldn't go
down there. It's not safe.

568
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:17,954
Go after her. She's going to...

569
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:19,556
She just pushed me.
She's not going to want me to...

570
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:21,989
I mean it. She's obviously
not feeling well.

571
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:38,272
Astreus Pictures.

572
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:40,141
Hello?

573
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:43,144
Hello?

574
00:59:49,486 --> 00:59:53,421
I don't feel good. I don't feel...

575
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:58,228
Hello?!

576
00:59:58,528 --> 01:00:00,895
I did what you asked.

577
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:11,939
Hey, you okay?

578
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:17,512
How dare you! How dare
you touch me! How dare you!

579
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:34,795
I'm sorry.

580
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:51,884
Sarah, if you can't really let yourself
go how can you ever transform

581
01:00:51,985 --> 01:00:54,451
- into something else?
- You're at the gates.

582
01:00:54,551 --> 01:00:58,755
All you need is for me
to open them for you.

583
01:00:58,855 --> 01:01:02,325
Maybe we didn't see what
we needed from you after all.

584
01:01:02,425 --> 01:01:04,260
Your face would be on the poster,

585
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:07,764
the poster on the wall,
a wall in a lobby,

586
01:01:07,864 --> 01:01:10,033
the lobby of the movie theater,

587
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:12,402
a theater with a marquee.

588
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,838
They are all losers. Cancer.

589
01:01:14,938 --> 01:01:17,574
Kill your old life, Sarah.

590
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:20,709
Bury it in the earth

591
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:26,046
and join us in the skies.

592
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:35,823
Sarah? You okay?

593
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:38,995
Go away.

594
01:01:39,295 --> 01:01:41,929
Listen, I really need to get in there.

595
01:01:44,934 --> 01:01:48,872
I... Just go away please.

596
01:01:48,972 --> 01:01:52,173
You've been in there for like, two hours.
I have to get ready for work.

597
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:16,898
Are you okay?

598
01:02:20,336 --> 01:02:22,203
Sweetie, what...?

599
01:02:29,812 --> 01:02:31,748
Do you smell that?

600
01:02:33,148 --> 01:02:35,552
I think it's coming from you.

601
01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:37,554
Yeah,

602
01:02:37,654 --> 01:02:44,193
Sarah, no offense,
but I mean, that's you.

603
01:02:44,293 --> 01:02:46,663
- Are you on your period?
- What?

604
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:49,599
Fuck you.
All right, that's enough, okay.

605
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:52,735
I've had enough of your shit.
What the hell's going on with you?

606
01:02:52,835 --> 01:02:54,835
You told them.

607
01:02:55,872 --> 01:02:57,273
- You told them.
- Who? What?

608
01:02:57,373 --> 01:03:00,978
About my audition. And the producer,

609
01:03:01,579 --> 01:03:03,296
- right?
- It came...

610
01:03:03,396 --> 01:03:05,582
I bet you all got off on it too, right?

611
01:03:05,882 --> 01:03:08,885
- No.
- Seeing me fail like that?

612
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:12,455
Sarah, those are your friends.
Okay, nobody wanted that for you.

613
01:03:12,555 --> 01:03:15,325
They're your friends!
They're your friends!

614
01:03:15,425 --> 01:03:17,994
I am trying to do something big.

615
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:21,731
I'm trying to do something with my life.

616
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:24,200
How am I supposed to do this

617
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:27,256
when you surround me with these...

618
01:03:27,557 --> 01:03:29,205
losers?

619
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:33,610
Do you hear the words that are
coming out of your mouth right now?

620
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:37,780
They're like venom to me,

621
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:42,485
like, like a cancer,
all of you guys, just all of you.

622
01:03:42,585 --> 01:03:47,890
You and Danny, Erin, just like,
living off of me.

623
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:50,726
Oh, living off of you?

624
01:03:51,026 --> 01:03:54,030
Okay, the last time I checked I covered
your rent for the past two months

625
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:56,105
and I'm guessing you don't have
this month's either because

626
01:03:56,206 --> 01:03:59,268
you're so obsessed with this job
that just wants to fuck you

627
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:02,536
instead of the job
that actually pays your bills.

628
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:32,333
What the fuck?

629
01:05:00,997 --> 01:05:05,833
Now it's our apartment again.
So do me a favor, Trace, and fuck off!

630
01:05:20,683 --> 01:05:22,183
Sarah.

631
01:05:29,123 --> 01:05:31,358
Don't fight it.

632
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:39,033
Sleep now, Sarah.
We want to show you something.

633
01:06:33,957 --> 01:06:36,393
I hope that's a working title.

634
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:40,995
- Are you sure you really...
- Danny was just talking about it...

635
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,802
Maybe we get to see the acting chops
that we've heard so much about.

636
01:06:46,902 --> 01:06:49,071
- Sarah, are you a Tater's girl?
- Tracey told us what happened.

637
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:51,205
He was just telling me...

638
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:54,508
You know what you have to do.

639
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:44,131
What's the matter, Sarah?
Are you not feeling well?

640
01:11:46,402 --> 01:11:48,435
I'm dying.

641
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:55,044
- I'm dying.
- Yes, you are.

642
01:11:55,144 --> 01:12:00,814
You can go into the ground to be
forgotten forever or you can be reborn.

643
01:12:03,352 --> 01:12:08,224
Did you expect it to be painless,
that it would be easy,

644
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:10,059
that you'd simply wake up one morning

645
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:14,564
with everything you ever
wanted laid out before you?

646
01:12:14,964 --> 01:12:17,465
I told you Sarah,

647
01:12:18,066 --> 01:12:21,437
dreams require sacrifice.

648
01:12:21,537 --> 01:12:23,873
And so do we.

649
01:12:23,973 --> 01:12:27,309
I can give you what you want Sarah,

650
01:12:27,409 --> 01:12:32,481
but you need to embrace
who you really are.

651
01:12:32,581 --> 01:12:36,919
It's time to become one of us.

652
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:41,488
It's time to be remembered.

653
01:12:52,901 --> 01:12:54,301
Grab something.

654
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,243
Hit him.

655
01:14:29,164 --> 01:14:31,867
I can't get over
comfortable your bed is.

656
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:33,936
More comfortable
than the five year old futon

657
01:14:34,036 --> 01:14:36,603
you've been dragging
around since college?

658
01:14:40,843 --> 01:14:42,442
I got to pee.

659
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:47,149
- You want anything?
- Yeah, I want some water

660
01:14:47,249 --> 01:14:49,885
and a treat, a little special something.

661
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:51,585
Okay.

662
01:15:49,311 --> 01:15:52,212
- Bravo.
- Jesus fucking Christ.

663
01:15:55,017 --> 01:15:56,786
Sarah?

664
01:15:57,286 --> 01:16:00,256
You scared the shit out of me.

665
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:02,155
Don't!

666
01:16:06,328 --> 01:16:09,429
Sarah, what are you doing here?

667
01:16:11,166 --> 01:16:15,337
You let him put that
revolting thing in you.

668
01:16:15,437 --> 01:16:18,974
And then he gives you
the role of Simone back.

669
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:21,441
You were watching us?

670
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:28,251
You think I had to fuck Danny
to get a role in his movie?

671
01:16:29,551 --> 01:16:34,057
That's sad that you see
the world like that.

672
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:39,662
Sarah, you know that me and Danny
have hooked up before, right?

673
01:16:39,762 --> 01:16:43,564
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe we just like each other?

674
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:50,474
Sarah, get the fuck out of here.

675
01:16:51,874 --> 01:16:54,110
You know what's sad?

676
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:56,176
You.

677
01:16:57,846 --> 01:16:59,946
All of you.

678
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:06,256
A role in Danny's little film, how sad.

679
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:11,994
What's sadder is that you
think I want any of it,

680
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:14,161
that I'd sink so low.

681
01:17:15,864 --> 01:17:19,668
Right. Why would you have
to fuck Danny for her role

682
01:17:19,768 --> 01:17:23,807
when you've already fucked
some big time movie producer?

683
01:17:24,907 --> 01:17:30,277
Yeah, Tracy told us about the stack
of cash from Astreus Pictures.

684
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:37,086
Oh, my God,

685
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:39,788
Sarah, did you...

686
01:17:39,888 --> 01:17:44,059
Did you actually suck
some old producer's cock

687
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:48,429
for a role in a movie
called The Silver Scream?

688
01:17:56,036 --> 01:17:58,007
That's sad.

689
01:17:58,707 --> 01:18:01,143
It's a gateway part.

690
01:18:01,243 --> 01:18:03,078
From here it sounds
a lot like prostitution.

691
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:04,378
Don't!

692
01:18:09,551 --> 01:18:12,388
- Sarah, what happened to you?
- Don't, don't touch me.

693
01:18:12,488 --> 01:18:13,489
- Sarah...
- Don't touch me.

694
01:18:13,589 --> 01:18:14,590
- Sarah.
- Don't.

695
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:15,658
Stop it, stop it.

696
01:18:15,758 --> 01:18:19,893
- We need to get you to a hospital.
- No, no, get off me.

697
01:19:05,707 --> 01:19:08,274
It feels good.

698
01:19:13,282 --> 01:19:16,650
See what happens when you stop fighting?

699
01:19:18,454 --> 01:19:21,090
Trust us, Sarah.

700
01:19:21,390 --> 01:19:23,890
Don't hurt yourself.

701
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:28,562
Let us in. Embrace who you are.

702
01:20:30,425 --> 01:20:32,192
What's up?

703
01:23:28,603 --> 01:23:30,170
Sarah?

704
01:23:33,074 --> 01:23:34,941
What are you doing here?

705
01:23:40,248 --> 01:23:42,448
Hey, did you see Erin?

706
01:23:43,952 --> 01:23:47,420
Yeah. We talked.

707
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:52,594
Okay, what did you talk about?

708
01:23:52,894 --> 01:23:54,427
You.

709
01:23:56,164 --> 01:23:57,764
Right.

710
01:24:02,737 --> 01:24:06,677
Did she tell you
how worried we are about you?

711
01:24:08,577 --> 01:24:11,514
Since you ran off the other night?

712
01:24:12,114 --> 01:24:16,086
You know, Tracy came by here,
she said the two of you had a big fight.

713
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:20,019
We're all pretty concerned.

714
01:24:26,962 --> 01:24:30,053
Look, Sarah, whatever is going on...

715
01:24:32,954 --> 01:24:34,967
we can help you.

716
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:38,475
You know, just talk to me.

717
01:24:40,175 --> 01:24:42,058
You,

718
01:24:42,759 --> 01:24:44,644
help me?

719
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:50,917
Yeah.

720
01:24:53,388 --> 01:24:56,125
Yeah, I'm your friend.

721
01:24:56,825 --> 01:24:59,159
No, you're not.

722
01:24:59,894 --> 01:25:02,428
None of you are.

723
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:07,367
Sarah, of course we are.

724
01:25:09,771 --> 01:25:11,604
Sarah?

725
01:25:12,874 --> 01:25:15,308
Jesus, what's wrong with you?
Are you...?

726
01:25:27,756 --> 01:25:29,989
I don't have any friends.

727
01:25:38,566 --> 01:25:40,333
Wait! Don't!

728
01:25:41,770 --> 01:25:44,237
Sarah, don't, don't.

729
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:51,210
Why, why?

730
01:25:53,748 --> 01:25:57,487
There's only one thing in
this whole world that I want

731
01:25:59,087 --> 01:26:01,754
and they're going to give it to me.

732
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:14,333
They see the real me.

733
01:27:43,157 --> 01:27:44,190
Yes.

734
01:27:48,296 --> 01:27:51,499
Hail Astreus. Hail Astreus.

735
01:27:51,599 --> 01:27:54,934
Hail Astreus. Hail Astreus.

736
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:58,640
Hail Astreus. Hail Astreus.

737
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:01,941
Hail Astreus. Hail Astreus.

738
01:28:02,076 --> 01:28:05,313
Hail Astreus. Hail Astreus.

739
01:28:05,413 --> 01:28:08,650
Hail Astreus. Hail Astreus.

740
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:12,285
Hail Astreus. Hail Astreus.

741
01:28:12,387 --> 01:28:15,557
Hail Astreus. Hail Astreus.

742
01:28:15,657 --> 01:28:18,960
Hail Astreus. Hail Astreus.

743
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:21,596
Hail Astreus. Hail...

744
01:28:21,696 --> 01:28:25,665
She is ready to transform.

745
01:29:31,666 --> 01:29:33,399
Sarah?

746
01:29:35,804 --> 01:29:38,070
Sarah, are you here?

747
01:29:45,013 --> 01:29:46,712
Sarah?

748
01:29:47,882 --> 01:29:49,815
Are you in there?

749
01:29:53,621 --> 01:29:55,154
Sarah?

750
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:01,797
All right, this is just weird.

751
01:30:02,397 --> 01:30:04,830
And a fire hazard.

752
01:30:07,335 --> 01:30:11,637
Look, I'm sorry, okay.

753
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:16,762
I shouldn't have told everyone
what happened. That's your business.

754
01:30:16,862 --> 01:30:21,180
If you wanted them to know
then, well, you would've told them.

755
01:30:25,019 --> 01:30:28,954
Anyway, I needed to say that.

756
01:30:30,692 --> 01:30:33,559
Hey, are you okay in there?

757
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:45,238
You're hurting me.

758
01:30:51,245 --> 01:30:54,650
Your eyes. You told everyone.

759
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:57,719
Lie down next to me.

760
01:30:57,819 --> 01:31:02,791
Come lie next to me, Trace,
like old times.

761
01:31:03,991 --> 01:31:06,158
I don't want to do that.

762
01:31:07,362 --> 01:31:09,398
Come to me.

763
01:31:10,198 --> 01:31:13,900
We're all alone. There's nothing.

764
01:31:23,878 --> 01:31:26,645
Things are changing for me, Trace.

765
01:31:27,749 --> 01:31:29,183
That's good.

766
01:31:30,483 --> 01:31:32,651
I'm happy for you.

767
01:31:33,521 --> 01:31:36,155
I just wanted to say goodbye.

768
01:31:38,226 --> 01:31:41,961
Where... are you going?

769
01:31:46,067 --> 01:31:48,401
Just say goodbye to me, Trace.
