1
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:46,535
- You're gonna burn him. Be careful.
- Shut up.

2
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,831
Oh, my God...

3
00:02:51,513 --> 00:02:52,973
Holy...

4
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,582
You girls are cruel.

5
00:03:14,251 --> 00:03:17,121
Guys, quit. You're going...
Seriously just stop.

6
00:03:17,221 --> 00:03:20,591
- You're going to burn...
- What was that?!

7
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,593
- Matt, stop.
- Wha...

8
00:03:22,693 --> 00:03:25,162
- Matt, stop the car. You hit something.
- What?

9
00:03:25,362 --> 00:03:27,532
Wait, let me get my camera.

10
00:03:27,632 --> 00:03:29,233
Something's burning.
The engine's burning.

11
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:32,003
Fucked up the front end.
Everyone, chill. Everyone, chill.

12
00:03:32,103 --> 00:03:33,910
You gonna give the deer
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation?

13
00:03:37,642 --> 00:03:39,210
Hit a fucking deer or something.

14
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,912
I mean, you good, man.
The car's still running.

15
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,880
- I'm good?!
- There's nothing leaking...

16
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,315
- 700 bucks!
- Look, there's nothing leaking

17
00:03:44,415 --> 00:03:46,884
at the bottom, bro.
You're straight. It sounded fine.

18
00:03:46,984 --> 00:03:49,020
- We can get there. Let's go.
- I know, but it's just...

19
00:03:54,925 --> 00:03:56,460
That wasn't no deer, bro.

20
00:04:17,848 --> 00:04:19,423
It's here.

21
00:04:31,962 --> 00:04:34,298
Fuck what is that? Over there.

22
00:04:34,598 --> 00:04:36,578
Look at the leaves.

23
00:04:43,774 --> 00:04:46,110
Holy shit.

24
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,756
Guys, something's moving out there.

25
00:04:55,018 --> 00:04:56,520
Let's go!

26
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,690
- Jesus.
- Okay, okay. We're coming. Chill.

27
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,126
Matt, maybe we should just go home.

28
00:05:02,426 --> 00:05:04,362
Babe, I've driven, like, 8 hours.

29
00:05:04,462 --> 00:05:06,164
- I'm not just going to turn around.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

30
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,065
Really? Really? My beard?

31
00:05:08,165 --> 00:05:11,302
- Shut up, Brian.
- You shut up. You burnt my fucking beard.

32
00:05:11,402 --> 00:05:13,967
Yo, did anybody see what that was?

33
00:05:14,067 --> 00:05:15,806
- Maybe it was a bear.
- Wait, wait, wait.

34
00:05:15,906 --> 00:05:17,542
- I got something.
- I don't know if it was a fucking bear.

35
00:05:17,642 --> 00:05:20,551
- It's probably a deer or something.
- What is that?

36
00:05:21,912 --> 00:05:23,220
Yo, what the fuck is that?

37
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:28,452
It looks like it's walking.

38
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,255
Fucking shit!

39
00:05:31,355 --> 00:05:33,091
- I think I missed the road.
- What the hell?

40
00:05:33,191 --> 00:05:36,494
There we go. This is it.

41
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:41,565
- Riverfront.
- Oh, that shit is overgrown.

42
00:05:41,765 --> 00:05:44,168
- Is this for real it?
- Oh, my God.

43
00:05:44,268 --> 00:05:47,278
Trust me, it's better
on the other side, guys.

44
00:05:57,581 --> 00:05:59,483
Dude, I don't remember it being this...

45
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:03,157
- Do you remember where we stop?
- No.

46
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,632
Bro, your uncle has a cabin out here?

47
00:06:14,732 --> 00:06:16,109
Yeah, dude.

48
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:32,683
- What the fuck bro?
- We're not getting past that.

49
00:06:33,183 --> 00:06:36,453
It's seriously just up here.
We've got to walk from here.

50
00:06:36,553 --> 00:06:38,189
What do you mean you can't...

51
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:40,691
- What? Where do you want to go around?
- I don't know!

52
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,998
- What are you getting out for?
- She's right. We have to walk from here.

53
00:06:47,098 --> 00:06:48,736
- Are you serious?
- I'm not walking.

54
00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:52,636
Black people don't do this shit, man.

55
00:06:53,475 --> 00:06:56,021
All right, guys.
It's just up here to the right.

56
00:07:00,922 --> 00:07:02,580
Let's go.

57
00:07:03,281 --> 00:07:05,516
Anybody hear that?

58
00:07:05,816 --> 00:07:07,624
Hear what?

59
00:07:10,087 --> 00:07:12,124
I heard something, man.

60
00:07:17,695 --> 00:07:19,285
There it is.

61
00:07:20,698 --> 00:07:22,867
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

62
00:07:23,334 --> 00:07:25,236
Home, sweet home.

63
00:07:25,436 --> 00:07:26,837
Seriously?

64
00:07:27,337 --> 00:07:29,507
Trust me, guys.
It looks a lot better in the daylight.

65
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,176
Oh, shit. Jesus. Watch out on the right.

66
00:07:32,276 --> 00:07:34,019
There's a loose board.

67
00:07:36,514 --> 00:07:39,050
Whoa.

68
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,818
Guess we didn't need
to steal the keys, huh?

69
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,119
Shut up.

70
00:07:48,526 --> 00:07:50,028
Man.

71
00:08:00,382 --> 00:08:04,942
I mean, yeah, we just gotta brush off some
of these leaves and stuff, but... this is it.

72
00:08:07,044 --> 00:08:10,281
When's the last time he was here?

73
00:08:10,381 --> 00:08:12,850
Kind of looks like somebody
left in a hurry.

74
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,585
It's like a lovemaking
palace up in here.

75
00:08:14,685 --> 00:08:16,420
Sweat stains on it.

76
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,292
Usually they got rose petals and shit
on the ground but we got leaves.

77
00:08:21,392 --> 00:08:24,762
We got leaves. This is...
you can make tons of magic up in here.

78
00:08:24,862 --> 00:08:27,598
I mean, you just hop on, you know?

79
00:08:28,714 --> 00:08:30,434
Oh, baby!

80
00:08:30,534 --> 00:08:31,802
- All right, Brian.
- Yeah!

81
00:08:31,902 --> 00:08:33,904
- So lame.
- Brian, quit it.

82
00:08:34,004 --> 00:08:36,407
You're making it all fucking dusty.

83
00:08:36,507 --> 00:08:38,676
Fucking job!

84
00:08:38,776 --> 00:08:41,445
- What the hell was that?
- What was that?

85
00:08:41,545 --> 00:08:43,582
Hello?

86
00:08:45,849 --> 00:08:47,285
Hello?

87
00:08:47,385 --> 00:08:50,489
Matt, hold on. Matt. Wait up.

88
00:08:54,226 --> 00:08:55,764
Don't go over there.

89
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,873
Seriously, there's a fucking pig
in your cabin?

90
00:09:09,773 --> 00:09:11,442
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Oh, hell, no, man.

91
00:09:11,542 --> 00:09:14,309
- We'll get it out and we'll just...
- I'm not touching it! It's your cabin.

92
00:09:14,409 --> 00:09:17,615
- And I'm not staying in this motherfucker.
- It's a fucking hog. We're out in the woods.

93
00:09:17,715 --> 00:09:19,850
- I'm not staying here.
- Me neither.

94
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,452
Come on, babe. Fuck that.

95
00:10:00,124 --> 00:10:02,020
Matt.

96
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,495
What?

97
00:10:09,933 --> 00:10:11,938
What is that?

98
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,222
You see anything?

99
00:10:36,126 --> 00:10:37,603
No.

100
00:10:39,262 --> 00:10:41,267
Just go to sleep.

101
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,379
It sounds like it's crying.

102
00:10:51,575 --> 00:10:53,410
Close the window dude.

103
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,880
- Do you hear that?
- Close the window.

104
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,249
Dude, you don't hear... come on.

105
00:10:59,419 --> 00:11:01,222
Oh, you're a dick.

106
00:11:11,695 --> 00:11:14,265
Dude, do you think it was that shit
that Uncle Bob saw back in the day?

107
00:11:14,365 --> 00:11:17,773
- Shut up about that.
- Why?

108
00:11:21,005 --> 00:11:24,509
Not a word about any of that
stupid shit. I'm serious.

109
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,780
I'm serious.

110
00:11:39,056 --> 00:11:41,427
Maybe it's that thing we hit.

111
00:12:14,925 --> 00:12:17,166
Oh, my God.

112
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:19,968
What do we got here?

113
00:12:24,968 --> 00:12:27,705
So... this is pretty sweet.

114
00:12:27,805 --> 00:12:31,205
Usually when you put a GoPro
camera inside of this casing,

115
00:12:31,305 --> 00:12:33,444
it doesn't focus very well underwater.

116
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:37,014
So, I went out and I bought
one of these bad boys.

117
00:12:37,114 --> 00:12:39,850
That's going to help me focus underwater
because it's got a flat lens.

118
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:42,886
So, we're pretty much going to get
some pimp shots underwater today.

119
00:12:42,986 --> 00:12:45,122
What's going on? Hey.

120
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,491
- Brian.
- What's up?

121
00:12:47,591 --> 00:12:50,994
- Come swimming with us.
- Oh, I'll be right there.

122
00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:53,664
What's up? How you doing?

123
00:12:53,764 --> 00:12:56,333
- What is this?
- It's called a little GoPro camera.

124
00:12:56,433 --> 00:12:58,369
- You're an obsessed freak.
- What's going to happen is

125
00:12:58,469 --> 00:13:00,004
I'm going to make you guys
look like super pimps

126
00:13:00,104 --> 00:13:01,772
because we're going to have
the best YouTube video ever.

127
00:13:01,872 --> 00:13:04,007
- You're lame. Let's go.
- Hold up, hold up.

128
00:13:04,107 --> 00:13:05,995
I got to get this shit together.

129
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,660
Die, motherfuckers!

130
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:19,022
Good shit! That's great shit!

131
00:13:19,122 --> 00:13:21,333
Shit, dude, nice!

132
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,728
- What you got? What you got?
- Want to see what I got?

133
00:13:24,828 --> 00:13:26,797
- I'd love to see what you got.
- I'm going to show y'all what I got.

134
00:13:26,897 --> 00:13:29,695
- Hold up, this is how I'm about to do it.
- Make me proud.

135
00:13:30,501 --> 00:13:32,903
YouTube ain't got shit on us, man!

136
00:13:33,003 --> 00:13:35,405
Oh! Damn!

137
00:13:35,505 --> 00:13:39,078
I don't know. Todd may have just
shown up Matt for sure.

138
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,952
What do we got here?

139
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:27,233
Looks like a little love walk going on.

140
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,216
God, I am so going to hell for this.

141
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:49,384
Todd you son of a bitch.
I hate you, you lucky bastard.

142
00:14:51,114 --> 00:14:53,423
I shouldn't be shooting this.

143
00:15:01,325 --> 00:15:04,295
Oh, shit! What the fuck is that?!
What the sh... what the hell was that?

144
00:15:04,395 --> 00:15:05,829
I know that's not Brian.

145
00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:08,265
Dude, be careful man.
There's something over there.

146
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:09,967
There's something over there.
It just ran up the ridge.

147
00:15:10,067 --> 00:15:12,603
- I know what's over here, bro.
- I know. I'm serious, man.

148
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,304
There's something fucking
over there, all right?

149
00:15:14,404 --> 00:15:15,606
Brian, you're a fucking asshole!

150
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,108
- I didn't get anything!
- What the fuck is wrong with you?!

151
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:21,245
- Give me the fucking camera, man.
- You're going to break the fucking camera, man!

152
00:15:21,345 --> 00:15:22,844
- What the fuck dude?!
- God you are such an...

153
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,015
Seriously, I need that
fucking memory card.

154
00:15:25,115 --> 00:15:26,550
You're recording your little brother's
friends in the woods?

155
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:29,252
- What is wrong with you?
- I got your memory card. Come get it.

156
00:15:29,352 --> 00:15:32,443
- Yeah, whatever dude.
- What's going on, man? What's going on?

157
00:15:32,543 --> 00:15:34,391
Your brother's recording us
messing around in the woods.

158
00:15:34,491 --> 00:15:36,360
Now you talking shit!
I will fuck you up!

159
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,294
What's wrong with you?!

160
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:40,097
Because of that fucking memory card!
There was a fucking beast on the memory card!

161
00:15:40,197 --> 00:15:42,766
- Okay, no need to name Todd's dick.
- Oh, that's really fucking cute.

162
00:15:42,866 --> 00:15:45,335
- You're fucking cute!
- I'm being fucking serious, man.

163
00:15:45,435 --> 00:15:47,071
Serious?
You're acting like an eight-year-old.

164
00:15:47,171 --> 00:15:47,938
Come on, bro.

165
00:15:48,038 --> 00:15:50,674
We're about to go shoot some paintballs.
Film us doing that or something, man.

166
00:15:50,774 --> 00:15:52,843
That sounds like a fun fucking time.
You dicks.

167
00:15:52,943 --> 00:15:54,144
What'd you say?!

168
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,065
I said I'll be in the woods.

169
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:06,356
This is definitely where I was shooting.

170
00:16:06,456 --> 00:16:09,865
He ran across that ridge. Right there.

171
00:16:18,135 --> 00:16:20,137
This is definitely the spot.

172
00:16:22,072 --> 00:16:24,203
I hear something.

173
00:16:27,744 --> 00:16:30,547
See, years ago,

174
00:16:30,647 --> 00:16:33,249
my uncle saw something out here.

175
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:37,153
Something that freaked him the fuck out.

176
00:16:39,156 --> 00:16:42,993
Bad enough that he never came back
to his beloved hunting cabin.

177
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,402
He never used the word Bigfoot

178
00:16:52,502 --> 00:16:56,340
but man, if it's out here,

179
00:16:57,674 --> 00:17:00,668
Brian Tover's going to get it on video.

180
00:17:01,011 --> 00:17:03,680
'Cause that's what I do, man.

181
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,617
That's my thing.

182
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,854
Hey.

183
00:17:11,454 --> 00:17:12,956
Hey, big man.

184
00:17:13,056 --> 00:17:16,899
We can be cool, man.
We can be... we can be friends.

185
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,100
'Cause, like, I'm hairy too, man.

186
00:17:20,797 --> 00:17:22,176
Chicks dig it, man.

187
00:17:25,068 --> 00:17:27,011
Holy fucking shit.

188
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,845
Look at the size of this print.

189
00:17:36,413 --> 00:17:38,551
Look at that thing.

190
00:17:39,449 --> 00:17:42,358
There's some toe marks in here.

191
00:17:45,055 --> 00:17:46,356
Holy shit.

192
00:17:54,498 --> 00:17:56,971
There's definitely something moving.

193
00:18:00,137 --> 00:18:01,980
Hello?

194
00:18:06,176 --> 00:18:07,914
Hello?

195
00:18:10,147 --> 00:18:12,007
Holy shit.

196
00:18:15,885 --> 00:18:17,792
Holy shit.

197
00:18:20,157 --> 00:18:22,237
I think I see something.

198
00:18:26,196 --> 00:18:27,819
Hey.

199
00:18:28,932 --> 00:18:31,105
We can be friends, man.

200
00:18:39,776 --> 00:18:41,619
Holy shit.

201
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,588
I'm backing off.

202
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,427
It's your house.

203
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,166
You know where I'll be.
Yeah, you know where I'll be.

204
00:19:12,743 --> 00:19:14,644
It's 1:37 a.m.

205
00:19:14,744 --> 00:19:18,705
I think the noise from up there
at the cabin is probably...

206
00:19:19,305 --> 00:19:21,844
scaring anything off.

207
00:19:21,944 --> 00:19:24,154
It'll come, but...

208
00:19:27,891 --> 00:19:30,693
man, as soon as those lights go off...

209
00:19:31,661 --> 00:19:33,165
then we're going to have something.

210
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,566
Should be...

211
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,745
coming from right over here.

212
00:19:41,338 --> 00:19:43,074
Until then,

213
00:19:44,842 --> 00:19:46,610
I'm just going to wait.

214
00:19:50,881 --> 00:19:52,983
Trying to get some...

215
00:19:53,283 --> 00:19:54,889
creatures out of the woods here.

216
00:19:56,253 --> 00:19:58,321
Just got to mimic their sounds.

217
00:19:59,237 --> 00:20:01,091
It's got to be very delicate.

218
00:20:07,564 --> 00:20:10,600
- What are you doing?
- Oh, sorry.

219
00:20:12,269 --> 00:20:14,037
I'm...

220
00:20:14,137 --> 00:20:16,006
just recording some stuff.

221
00:20:16,106 --> 00:20:20,911
I got some GoPros set up
all over the forest.

222
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:25,382
If anything moves up in here,
Brian Tover's going to catch it.

223
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:28,262
- Why?
- Why?

224
00:20:28,832 --> 00:20:31,622
Why? 'Cause I'm making a video.
Because it's going to be huge.

225
00:20:31,722 --> 00:20:35,892
This is going to be like
"Alien Autopsy" huge, you know?

226
00:20:35,992 --> 00:20:39,696
Like... like YouTube top fucking ten.

227
00:20:39,796 --> 00:20:43,099
Okay, whatever. Can you please
just be quiet? We're trying to sleep.

228
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:44,301
- I'm sorry.
- Good night.

229
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:47,270
I'll be quiet.
I'm just letting you know.

230
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:48,739
- All right?
- Good night.

231
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:53,343
Shit's going to be like...
like "Daily Show" huge.

232
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:58,948
I think those calls did the trick.

233
00:20:59,048 --> 00:21:03,155
And now we motherfucking wait.

234
00:21:32,215 --> 00:21:33,360
Damn it!

235
00:21:41,124 --> 00:21:43,167
There's a noise.

236
00:21:50,167 --> 00:21:52,535
I definitely heard some sounds.

237
00:21:52,635 --> 00:21:54,637
Just out here.

238
00:21:58,575 --> 00:22:01,016
Sounds like what I heard yesterday.

239
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,754
Looks like it found me.

240
00:22:13,141 --> 00:22:15,001
Fuck.

241
00:22:21,864 --> 00:22:23,810
Holy shit.

242
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:28,905
Hey, man.

243
00:22:36,713 --> 00:22:38,392
Hello?

244
00:22:39,516 --> 00:22:41,896
Mr. Sasquatch?

245
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,593
I just want to be friends.

246
00:22:47,957 --> 00:22:50,277
Mr. Sasquatch?

247
00:22:52,757 --> 00:22:56,266
Shit! Motherfucker!
What the fuck, dude?!

248
00:22:57,934 --> 00:23:00,470
Man, that's fucked up, dude.
You guys are fucking assholes.

249
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,706
You should have seen your face, man.

250
00:23:03,369 --> 00:23:07,344
Shit, dude! You fucking dick, man.

251
00:23:07,444 --> 00:23:11,681
Mr. Sasquatch,
can I suck your hairy cock?

252
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:15,151
Holy fuck.

253
00:23:17,053 --> 00:23:19,122
- We should get inside. Go, go.
- Holy shit.

254
00:23:19,222 --> 00:23:20,895
Let's go.

255
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:34,546
- Go, go, go. Go, go, go, go.
- What the fuck?

256
00:23:34,971 --> 00:23:37,307
Turn off the lights.
Turn off the lights.

257
00:23:37,407 --> 00:23:39,609
Get the lights. Get the lights.
Get the lights.

258
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:42,979
Todd, what is that?

259
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:45,982
- I don't fucking know.
- There's something out there.

260
00:23:46,697 --> 00:23:49,273
That ain't no fucking animal, man.
What the fuck is that?

261
00:23:49,373 --> 00:23:51,494
- I know what it is.
- Shut up. Shut up.

262
00:24:01,097 --> 00:24:03,133
Okay, we'll just stay close
and stay quiet.

263
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:15,679
- Guys, get back, get back, get back.
- Do you see anything?

264
00:24:19,382 --> 00:24:22,752
- I want to go. I want to go now.
- Okay, listen. I know, baby. Listen.

265
00:24:22,852 --> 00:24:25,008
- Now might not be the best time, okay?
- We're safe in the cabin.

266
00:24:25,108 --> 00:24:27,824
- You need to calm down.
- Guys, we're safe in the cabin.

267
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,125
We have to stay calm, okay?

268
00:24:29,225 --> 00:24:31,628
We're going to be fine
as long as we don't provoke it okay?

269
00:24:31,728 --> 00:24:35,165
There's no credible documented cases
of a Sasquatch attack.

270
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,067
Shut up about a Sasquatch.

271
00:24:37,167 --> 00:24:38,201
- I'm serious.
- Shut up.

272
00:24:50,647 --> 00:24:53,725
We're in fucking East Texas, okay?
The big fucking thicket.

273
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:58,321
- There's a new sighting every goddamn week.
- Okay, guys. Whatever it is,

274
00:24:58,421 --> 00:25:00,590
we'll just leave in the morning, okay?

275
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:02,559
- When the sun comes up.
- All right.

276
00:25:02,659 --> 00:25:03,927
- Okay?
- Okay.

277
00:25:07,197 --> 00:25:09,740
Turn the fucking flashlight off.

278
00:25:54,735 --> 00:25:57,614
Okay, okay, okay.

279
00:26:12,595 --> 00:26:14,572
Is it gone?

280
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:27,911
Brian, get your crazy ass back here.

281
00:26:28,011 --> 00:26:29,622
It's okay.

282
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,549
Brian.

283
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:44,861
It's gone. It's okay.
There's nothing out here.

284
00:26:49,032 --> 00:26:51,100
- What was that?!
- What the fuck is that?

285
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,270
What was it? What'd you see?

286
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:55,538
- I think I got it on film.
- Got what?

287
00:26:55,638 --> 00:26:57,040
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

288
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,210
- You scared it off. You scared it off.
- It ran off. It ran off.

289
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,611
- Okay.
- I think I got it.

290
00:27:01,711 --> 00:27:04,748
- Shut up!
- Bri, what was it?

291
00:27:04,848 --> 00:27:07,295
It was fucking Bigfoot dude.

292
00:27:09,058 --> 00:27:11,180
What was that?

293
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:15,658
- Oh, shit.
- Shut up, shut up.

294
00:27:16,158 --> 00:27:19,696
- What the fuck?!
- What is it?

295
00:27:25,668 --> 00:27:28,049
You guys, what is it doing?

296
00:27:31,106 --> 00:27:33,675
Don't open... don't open the window.
Are you crazy?!

297
00:27:53,496 --> 00:27:55,907
- Oh, shit.
- Fuck.

298
00:27:58,935 --> 00:28:02,099
Fuck. What the fuck?

299
00:28:02,372 --> 00:28:04,028
Shit.

300
00:28:06,609 --> 00:28:10,452
- What the... oh, shit.
- Motherfuck.

301
00:28:12,749 --> 00:28:15,320
See if it starts, man. Maybe it starts.

302
00:28:19,522 --> 00:28:21,281
Fucking nothing.

303
00:28:21,781 --> 00:28:24,015
- No? Come on, bro.
- Nothing!

304
00:28:25,528 --> 00:28:27,296
Brian, let's go back.

305
00:28:27,396 --> 00:28:29,599
I thought Brian said they were peaceful.

306
00:28:29,699 --> 00:28:31,534
- Brian, I thought you said...
- I thought you said it was peaceful.

307
00:28:31,634 --> 00:28:33,436
That's what the fucking book
said, all right?

308
00:28:33,536 --> 00:28:35,540
Let's get the fuck back.

309
00:28:50,153 --> 00:28:52,488
We just wait.

310
00:28:54,124 --> 00:28:57,835
We have plenty of food and we'll just wait
until his uncle gets here.

311
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:05,035
My uncle's not coming.

312
00:29:05,135 --> 00:29:07,637
Well, he's going to figure out
that we're not back eventually.

313
00:29:07,737 --> 00:29:10,039
I stole the key.

314
00:29:10,139 --> 00:29:13,716
- From Uncle Bob.
- Are you kidding?

315
00:29:15,912 --> 00:29:17,823
What does he mean he stole the key?

316
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:23,286
Because he doesn't let anyone
come out here.

317
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,321
So no one knows we're here?

318
00:29:26,167 --> 00:29:27,837
No.

319
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:32,387
Are you fucking kidding me?!

320
00:29:33,362 --> 00:29:36,165
- Why the hell, Matt?!
- It's not his fault.

321
00:29:36,265 --> 00:29:39,885
No, it's not just his fault. It's your fucking
fault, too, because you knew, too!

322
00:29:39,985 --> 00:29:44,209
Dora, come on. I'm sorry.
Calm down, okay?

323
00:29:44,941 --> 00:29:46,091
Matt,

324
00:29:47,522 --> 00:29:50,747
nobody knows we're out here.
What the fuck are we going to do, bro?

325
00:29:51,447 --> 00:29:53,349
Dude, hold up.

326
00:29:53,449 --> 00:29:56,341
Matt, I'll go. I'll go. I'll go.

327
00:29:57,186 --> 00:29:59,822
I'm faster than you.
No offense, but I'm faster, dude.

328
00:29:59,922 --> 00:30:04,260
I know these woods, okay?
Just take care of the girls, okay?

329
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,796
Matt, wait.

330
00:30:07,314 --> 00:30:08,865
I'll be back, okay, babe?

331
00:30:09,065 --> 00:30:12,125
- Baby, you don't have to do this.
- It's okay. It's okay.

332
00:30:12,225 --> 00:30:15,114
Matt, you don't have to do this, please.

333
00:30:15,972 --> 00:30:19,921
Hey, listen, bro.
You get cell phone reception,

334
00:30:20,021 --> 00:30:23,617
you make that call,
you get your ass back here, all right?

335
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,417
- Later, man.
- Good luck, Matt.

336
00:30:27,517 --> 00:30:30,190
- Ride fast bro.
- Like a demon.

337
00:30:32,495 --> 00:30:34,488
Don't stop.

338
00:31:16,492 --> 00:31:18,539
Damn it.

339
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,450
I know this isn't the weekend
you girls expected,

340
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:36,953
but this shit is serious.

341
00:31:37,053 --> 00:31:39,255
I don't know how long it's going to be
before Matt gets back

342
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:43,392
and whatever the fuck's out there is big
and if it gets in here, we're fucked.

343
00:31:43,592 --> 00:31:45,595
Okay, we're going to take
all the furniture,

344
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,830
we're going to put it
against the windows and doors.

345
00:31:48,576 --> 00:31:52,268
And Brian, what you're going to do
is put down the fucking camera.

346
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:55,471
- For real, bro.
- All right. Okay.

347
00:32:05,348 --> 00:32:08,492
Hey, hey, hey, hey. What do we got here?

348
00:32:09,585 --> 00:32:11,130
Come check this out guys.

349
00:32:12,355 --> 00:32:13,529
Oh, shit.

350
00:32:16,025 --> 00:32:17,393
Thank you.

351
00:32:17,793 --> 00:32:19,417
Hello?

352
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:26,135
- Check that out.
- Let me see what's going on.

353
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:27,709
- Babe, be careful.
- Yeah.

354
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:34,777
What you got?

355
00:32:34,877 --> 00:32:37,186
Let me see if I can find
a light. Hold up.

356
00:32:39,181 --> 00:32:42,685
Oh, shit! Hey, guys! Hey, we got a gun!

357
00:32:42,785 --> 00:32:44,687
Hell, yeah. You know what I'm saying?

358
00:32:44,787 --> 00:32:47,000
Dude. Dude, be careful
where you point that fucking thing.

359
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,663
Do you even know how to use that?

360
00:32:49,763 --> 00:32:53,629
- Todd, you just pointed the gun at my face.
- Todd, watch it!

361
00:32:53,729 --> 00:32:56,165
Hold on, dude. What the...

362
00:32:56,465 --> 00:32:58,034
Will you check to see if it's loaded?

363
00:32:58,134 --> 00:32:59,969
It's probably not even loaded.
Calm down and shit.

364
00:33:00,069 --> 00:33:03,079
- Do you even know how to open it?
- Calm down, calm down. I'm about to check.

365
00:33:03,739 --> 00:33:06,742
- Dude, really?
- It's loaded. Y'all going to be trippin...

366
00:33:06,842 --> 00:33:10,146
- Do you even know how to use a gun?
- I play paintball.

367
00:33:10,346 --> 00:33:12,349
How different can it be?

368
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,699
Come on.

369
00:33:32,201 --> 00:33:34,285
Thank God. Okay.

370
00:33:40,376 --> 00:33:41,878
9-1-1. What's your emergency?

371
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,980
Yeah, we're trapped in a cabin
outside Route 212.

372
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,094
Hello? 9-1...

373
00:33:49,785 --> 00:33:52,421
- 9-1-1. What's your emergency?
- Yeah, my name's Matt Tover.

374
00:33:52,521 --> 00:33:55,024
- Hello? Is anyone there?
- We're outside Route 212 in a cabin.

375
00:33:55,124 --> 00:33:57,026
- Hello? 9-1-1.
- Hello?

376
00:33:57,126 --> 00:33:59,095
Fuck! Come on.

377
00:33:59,195 --> 00:34:00,941
Come on.

378
00:34:05,735 --> 00:34:08,237
- Hello? Hello?
- Please.

379
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,058
Hey, Uncle Bob. It's...

380
00:34:11,874 --> 00:34:13,109
Oh, God.

381
00:34:13,209 --> 00:34:16,012
Matt is that you? Matt? Can you hear me?

382
00:34:16,112 --> 00:34:18,781
- Uncle Bob, it's Matt!
- I'm having a bad connection.

383
00:34:18,881 --> 00:34:21,241
- I'm at the cabin!
- Hello?

384
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:23,122
Cabin?

385
00:34:23,222 --> 00:34:25,524
- Uncle Bob, it's Matt. We're at the cabin!
- Matt did you say the cabin?

386
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:36,073
What the fuck?!

387
00:34:41,603 --> 00:34:43,104
Come on!

388
00:34:44,691 --> 00:34:46,260
Come on!

389
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:19,461
Holy...

390
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,402
Help!

391
00:35:46,502 --> 00:35:48,871
Somebody!

392
00:36:00,983 --> 00:36:02,828
Fuck!

393
00:36:43,058 --> 00:36:45,738
Maybe he found somebody on the road.

394
00:36:48,697 --> 00:36:51,377
They're probably
on their way back right now.

395
00:36:56,171 --> 00:36:59,950
We knew why my uncle
never let anyone come out to this place.

396
00:37:03,912 --> 00:37:06,023
We just didn't believe him.

397
00:37:13,722 --> 00:37:16,224
We should have never come out here.

398
00:37:19,795 --> 00:37:21,629
I'm sorry.

399
00:37:26,435 --> 00:37:29,939
We should probably get inside.
It will be dark soon.

400
00:37:33,075 --> 00:37:37,021
Matt's the man, guys.
He's bringing back help.

401
00:37:37,513 --> 00:37:39,114
All right?

402
00:37:39,214 --> 00:37:41,007
Oh, shit!

403
00:37:42,451 --> 00:37:44,526
Holy fucking shit man.

404
00:37:52,861 --> 00:37:56,032
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Come on, Brian, come on!

405
00:37:56,632 --> 00:37:59,635
Oh, shit. Move something.
Move something.

406
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:01,804
- That's Matt's bike.
- Fuck.

407
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:03,672
Help me with this, man.
Help me with this.

408
00:38:03,772 --> 00:38:05,841
I'm trying, man.

409
00:38:06,141 --> 00:38:07,951
Move it!

410
00:38:10,673 --> 00:38:12,815
Fuck. Fuck.

411
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:16,752
- Come on. Grab that shit.
- Wait guys. Where is it?

412
00:38:16,852 --> 00:38:20,656
- I don't fucking know man.
- That's Matt's bike.

413
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:22,891
- Oh, shit.
- Do you see it?

414
00:38:22,991 --> 00:38:25,951
- I can't see shit.
- Check the other window.

415
00:38:29,465 --> 00:38:31,972
- Can you see it?
- I can't see shit out there.

416
00:38:33,002 --> 00:38:35,304
It's waiting for it to get dark.

417
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:39,383
It's waiting for the night.

418
00:39:34,396 --> 00:39:35,998
It's at the generator.

419
00:39:47,109 --> 00:39:49,511
- Oh, shit.
- It got the generator.

420
00:39:49,611 --> 00:39:52,248
He's fucking with us.
He's fucking with us.

421
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:55,617
Okay, okay. He's fucking with us.

422
00:39:55,717 --> 00:39:57,883
Oh, shit.

423
00:40:07,789 --> 00:40:09,498
Todd shoot it.

424
00:40:09,598 --> 00:40:12,401
- I don't want to waste a shot.
- Fuck that! Shoot it!

425
00:40:13,902 --> 00:40:16,005
- Be careful man.
- Fuck.

426
00:40:16,105 --> 00:40:18,883
Be careful... oh, shit.

427
00:40:21,209 --> 00:40:24,613
- Where'd it go?
- It's okay.

428
00:40:25,086 --> 00:40:29,651
It's gone, okay? It can't get in.
Fucker can't get in, okay?

429
00:40:29,751 --> 00:40:31,487
He can't get in.

430
00:40:35,194 --> 00:40:38,602
Get in the room! Get in the room!
Go, go, go, go!

431
00:40:41,764 --> 00:40:44,908
- Help me!
- Go, man.

432
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:51,974
What do we do now?

433
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:54,143
Okay.

434
00:40:57,846 --> 00:41:00,558
Okay, guys. Okay.

435
00:41:07,914 --> 00:41:10,903
Let's go. Let's go.

436
00:41:23,138 --> 00:41:24,840
Shit.

437
00:41:39,894 --> 00:41:41,523
I can't hold it!

438
00:41:56,171 --> 00:41:58,640
Where did it go?

439
00:41:59,499 --> 00:42:01,377
It ran off.

440
00:42:01,777 --> 00:42:04,680
- It's gone.
- I think you got it.

441
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,288
Yeah.

442
00:42:22,764 --> 00:42:25,046
Help me!

443
00:42:28,437 --> 00:42:30,782
- Guys, help her! Help her!
- Help me! Help me!

444
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:34,476
Get off her! Get off her, motherfucker!

445
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,631
Beth!

446
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:45,321
Shit, come on. Oh, shit.

447
00:42:45,421 --> 00:42:47,990
Brian, help me! Help me, man!

448
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,959
Go, go! Get to the cellar!

449
00:42:51,059 --> 00:42:54,463
- Got to get the gun. Come on.
- Get it.

450
00:43:14,016 --> 00:43:17,986
It thinks we're outside.
He doesn't know we're down here.

451
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:02,831
Be quiet okay baby? Please.

452
00:44:07,002 --> 00:44:08,871
Is it gone?

453
00:44:10,005 --> 00:44:14,142
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, God!
He looked at me! He looked right at me.

454
00:44:15,544 --> 00:44:18,180
- He knows we're in here.
- Shut up, shut up, shut up.

455
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,349
- He knows.
- Quiet. Be quiet. Shut up.

456
00:44:22,354 --> 00:44:24,728
He doesn't know. He doesn't know.

457
00:44:38,321 --> 00:44:40,168
Oh, my God.

458
00:44:40,498 --> 00:44:42,004
He knows.

459
00:44:42,602 --> 00:44:45,075
He fucking knows that we're here.

460
00:45:00,955 --> 00:45:02,691
Shoot him!

461
00:45:21,477 --> 00:45:23,417
Motherfucker.

462
00:45:29,785 --> 00:45:32,754
Let's go. Let's go.

463
00:45:33,824 --> 00:45:35,445
Are you okay?

464
00:45:47,869 --> 00:45:49,680
Lizzy.

465
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:52,583
Lizzy.

466
00:45:55,677 --> 00:45:57,954
Is she breathing?

467
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:00,984
- Is she okay?
- Wake up.

468
00:46:32,848 --> 00:46:35,041
Holy shit.

469
00:46:50,198 --> 00:46:52,200
Hey, guys.

470
00:46:54,169 --> 00:46:56,080
It's all clear up here.

471
00:47:36,378 --> 00:47:37,782
We got it.

472
00:47:45,353 --> 00:47:47,189
Oh, my God.

473
00:47:47,589 --> 00:47:49,126
Jesus.

474
00:48:33,301 --> 00:48:35,747
It's his fucking bike.

475
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:46,386
We have to go. We can't stay here.

476
00:48:48,583 --> 00:48:50,488
See you soon, man.

477
00:48:54,923 --> 00:48:56,969
What about Liz?

478
00:48:58,326 --> 00:49:00,428
We'll come back for her body.

479
00:49:19,548 --> 00:49:22,321
Brian, your cell phone working?

480
00:49:23,218 --> 00:49:24,886
No.

481
00:49:25,086 --> 00:49:27,059
- Yours?
- Fuck, no.

482
00:49:36,198 --> 00:49:37,917
Hey.

483
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,471
Hey.

484
00:49:41,669 --> 00:49:43,839
It's over this way.

485
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:45,907
- What?
- It's the trail.

486
00:49:46,107 --> 00:49:50,649
If we take the trail, it's going to take us
half the time to get to 212.

487
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,982
Look at that shit, man.
There's no road out there.

488
00:49:54,082 --> 00:49:56,027
I've been out here before.

489
00:49:58,186 --> 00:49:59,908
Sure?

490
00:50:10,698 --> 00:50:12,900
It's straight down there.

491
00:50:15,694 --> 00:50:17,242
Fuck.

492
00:50:19,006 --> 00:50:22,110
Some fucking shortcut you got, man.

493
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:24,746
Dora. Dora. Over this way.

494
00:50:24,846 --> 00:50:26,650
- What?
- Over this way.

495
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:31,920
No, no, no. We keep going right up here.

496
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:34,756
I'm serious.
We keep just walking right up here.

497
00:50:34,856 --> 00:50:38,960
- Dude, I know these fucking woods.
- Todd, he's been here before. Come on.

498
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:41,947
Yeah, whatever.
It better be over this way. Come on.

499
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:44,415
Holy shit.

500
00:50:48,903 --> 00:50:51,205
I think we did something to it.

501
00:50:56,077 --> 00:50:58,179
What the fuck did we do?

502
00:50:58,279 --> 00:51:00,687
We didn't do shit.
We didn't do anything.

503
00:51:12,894 --> 00:51:14,696
Holy shit.

504
00:51:14,896 --> 00:51:16,942
It's Matt's bag.

505
00:51:17,465 --> 00:51:19,067
- Oh, shit.
- Matt?

506
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,902
- Matt?
- Wait, Dora.

507
00:51:21,002 --> 00:51:22,831
Matt?

508
00:51:23,138 --> 00:51:25,473
- Matt?
- Dora, slow down. Slow down, Dora.

509
00:51:25,573 --> 00:51:27,719
I see more blood.

510
00:51:34,649 --> 00:51:36,656
Oh, God.

511
00:51:46,821 --> 00:51:50,740
No. No, no, no, no.

512
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:51,845
Shit.

513
00:51:54,202 --> 00:51:57,434
Hey. Hey, baby. Watch out, watch out.

514
00:52:07,884 --> 00:52:11,361
Leave me here.

515
00:52:41,215 --> 00:52:43,127
Slow down, slow down. I can't see shit.

516
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:47,589
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

517
00:52:47,989 --> 00:52:50,492
- You all right man?
- We got to rest, bro.

518
00:52:50,692 --> 00:52:52,627
Cut the light off.
Don't keep it on too long.

519
00:52:52,727 --> 00:52:54,628
All right.

520
00:52:55,196 --> 00:52:57,999
We got to find some cover,
somewhere not out...

521
00:52:58,099 --> 00:53:00,076
somewhere not out in the open.

522
00:53:08,910 --> 00:53:12,254
Where the...
where the hell's the 212, man?

523
00:53:14,449 --> 00:53:16,217
We're getting close.

524
00:53:16,317 --> 00:53:19,395
I remember this little bridge
and this road.

525
00:53:26,728 --> 00:53:28,607
Hey, man.

526
00:53:31,165 --> 00:53:33,436
I'm sorry about Liz, bro.

527
00:54:42,203 --> 00:54:44,707
I think it found us.

528
00:55:04,629 --> 00:55:06,377
Jesus.

529
00:55:08,363 --> 00:55:10,599
Chill out, chill out.

530
00:55:13,468 --> 00:55:17,043
- Fuck that. That thing killed Liz.
- Todd! Todd!

531
00:55:17,143 --> 00:55:19,175
- Brian, stay here. Stay here.
- I'm right here! Let's go!

532
00:55:19,275 --> 00:55:21,243
- Get under that.
- Where this fucker at?!

533
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:23,913
- I can do this all night, motherfucker!
- What are you doing? Shut up!

534
00:55:24,013 --> 00:55:27,816
- How you going to kill my friends?!
- Shut up, Todd. Todd!

535
00:55:27,916 --> 00:55:30,451
I'm killing this motherfucker right now!
Where you at?!

536
00:55:30,551 --> 00:55:31,830
Where you at?!

537
00:55:34,389 --> 00:55:35,824
You can't even see it.
What are you shooting at?

538
00:55:35,924 --> 00:55:38,473
What's up?! I'm right...

539
00:55:42,063 --> 00:55:45,199
- What the fuck? Oh, shit!
- Okay, okay.

540
00:55:46,601 --> 00:55:49,671
Fucking save the shell.
Save the shell, bro.

541
00:55:50,171 --> 00:55:51,234
Fuck it.

542
00:55:51,334 --> 00:55:54,242
- Dude, don't waste the shells.
- The shell's not coming out, man.

543
00:55:54,342 --> 00:55:56,277
The shell's not coming out, man.

544
00:55:56,377 --> 00:55:58,845
Yo, we can't stay here.
We got to move. We got to move.

545
00:55:58,945 --> 00:56:01,918
Dora, come on. Dora, let's go.
Let's go, let's go.

546
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:03,918
Watch out, watch out!

547
00:56:04,018 --> 00:56:07,389
- Go, go, go, go, go, go.
- Come on, y'all!

548
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:09,209
Fuck that shit, nigga!

549
00:56:10,511 --> 00:56:13,361
Come on, man. We got to fucking go.

550
00:56:13,561 --> 00:56:16,202
- Brian, come on.
- Careful. Coming.

551
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:21,169
- You guys see it?
- No.

552
00:56:21,269 --> 00:56:23,005
- Do you see it?
- Fucking be careful dude.

553
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:27,875
All right, man. Where the fuck are we, bro?
Where the fuck are we, bro?

554
00:56:28,675 --> 00:56:30,645
What is that?

555
00:56:30,745 --> 00:56:34,550
Guys, guys. There's people here.
There's people here. They can help us.

556
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,352
That looks deserted.
That looks deserted Brian.

557
00:56:37,452 --> 00:56:40,321
- Where the fuck are we, bro?
- Must be close to the 212.

558
00:56:40,421 --> 00:56:42,884
Okay, let's get the fuck
out of here, man. Where...

559
00:56:44,272 --> 00:56:47,262
- Matt?
- It's Matt! It's Matt!

560
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:49,064
- Yo, Matt!
- That's Matt.

561
00:56:49,164 --> 00:56:51,999
- Matt!
- Matt!

562
00:56:52,099 --> 00:56:54,536
- Matt!
- Brian.

563
00:56:54,636 --> 00:56:58,406
- Brian, hold on a second.
- Shut up. I can hear him.

564
00:56:58,806 --> 00:57:00,288
Oh...

565
00:57:00,857 --> 00:57:03,498
What the hell is that?

566
00:57:08,088 --> 00:57:09,684
Matt?

567
00:57:09,784 --> 00:57:11,786
- Where is he?
- Matt.

568
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:14,845
I don't hear him. Matt?

569
00:57:14,945 --> 00:57:17,595
Whoa, whoa. Yo.

570
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:23,741
- Matt.
- He sounds hurt. Matt.

571
00:57:23,841 --> 00:57:27,576
Come on. Let's go in here.

572
00:57:30,672 --> 00:57:32,487
Slow down.

573
00:57:36,377 --> 00:57:38,479
Holy fuck.

574
00:57:38,679 --> 00:57:40,409
Matt?

575
00:57:41,482 --> 00:57:43,251
Matt?

576
00:57:43,651 --> 00:57:46,721
It's some sort of a tunnel.

577
00:57:46,821 --> 00:57:48,997
Or a nest or something.

578
00:57:50,386 --> 00:57:53,061
Matt. He's down there. He's down there.

579
00:57:53,161 --> 00:57:55,386
- Hold this.
- Whoa. What are you doing?

580
00:57:56,864 --> 00:57:59,100
- What are you doing?
- I'm going in to get him.

581
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,984
Come on, dude.
You can't be going in there.

582
00:58:02,084 --> 00:58:04,239
I don't have a choice.
That's my bro down there.

583
00:58:04,539 --> 00:58:07,174
I've got this.
I'll be able to see in the dark.

584
00:58:07,274 --> 00:58:11,243
- Brian, it's all we got left.
- All right.

585
00:58:20,999 --> 00:58:23,257
He'll be all right, Dora.

586
00:58:23,457 --> 00:58:25,337
You're all right?

587
00:58:50,518 --> 00:58:52,264
Matt?

588
00:59:00,228 --> 00:59:03,224
Fuck. Which way?

589
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:06,001
Which way?

590
00:59:07,102 --> 00:59:08,625
Matt?

591
00:59:10,553 --> 00:59:14,075
- Matt?
- Brian? Brian?!

592
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:15,982
Matt.

593
00:59:17,445 --> 00:59:18,903
- Brian.
- Matt.

594
00:59:19,003 --> 00:59:21,783
Brian, Brian, over here. Over here.

595
00:59:21,883 --> 00:59:25,259
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

596
00:59:29,791 --> 00:59:31,993
Matt, how you doing, buddy?

597
00:59:32,093 --> 00:59:34,262
It's in here, man. You got to go.

598
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:37,298
- You got to get out of here, man.
- Okay, okay, okay.

599
00:59:37,398 --> 00:59:39,634
- Let's go. Let's go.
- You got to get out of here.

600
00:59:39,734 --> 00:59:41,269
Why?

601
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:44,149
- What, what, what?
- He smashed my legs.

602
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:48,276
- Shit.
- He smashed...

603
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:51,813
- He smashed my legs.
- I'm going to get you out of here, bro.

604
00:59:51,913 --> 00:59:54,048
I'm going to get you out of here.
Grab on to me.

605
00:59:54,148 --> 00:59:57,403
Where are you? I need you
to grab onto me. Grab on to me!

606
00:59:57,503 --> 00:59:59,588
Grab on to me. Grab on to my arm.

607
01:00:01,088 --> 01:00:03,500
It's still in here.

608
01:00:07,328 --> 01:00:09,622
It's still here.

609
01:00:11,466 --> 01:00:14,429
- He's here. I see him.
- Do you see it?

610
01:00:16,002 --> 01:00:20,217
Shoot it! Shoot it, Brian! Shoot it!

611
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:25,048
Shoot it!

612
01:00:25,546 --> 01:00:27,348
Shoot it!

613
01:00:30,151 --> 01:00:32,153
Did you get it? Did you get it?

614
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:35,623
I don't know. I think so. I think so.

615
01:00:35,723 --> 01:00:39,860
Come on. Grab on to me.
Grab on to me. Grab on to me.

616
01:00:42,830 --> 01:00:44,575
Come on.

617
01:00:48,369 --> 01:00:50,905
- Motherfucker!
- Okay, okay, okay.

618
01:00:51,446 --> 01:00:53,074
I can't see it.

619
01:00:53,723 --> 01:00:55,476
Come on. Hold on.

620
01:00:55,576 --> 01:00:57,845
Hold on to my hand, bro.
Hold on to my hand.

621
01:00:57,945 --> 01:01:01,050
Keep holding on. Keep holding on.

622
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:02,584
- Keep on holding.
- Holding.

623
01:01:02,684 --> 01:01:04,454
Come on.

624
01:01:11,092 --> 01:01:12,360
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, shit.

625
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:15,396
- Matt. Matt!
- You got him.

626
01:01:15,958 --> 01:01:18,121
- You made it bro.
- Todd, help me.

627
01:01:18,221 --> 01:01:20,668
You got him. You fucking got him.
That's what I'm talking about.

628
01:01:20,768 --> 01:01:23,437
All right, we're clear, we're clear.
We got to get him.

629
01:01:23,537 --> 01:01:25,223
All right.

630
01:01:29,043 --> 01:01:31,145
- Did you fucking kill that thing?
- Yeah, I shot it, man.

631
01:01:31,245 --> 01:01:33,214
- I shot it.
- Okay. Is it dead?

632
01:01:33,314 --> 01:01:35,116
- I think so.
- Move out of the way.

633
01:01:35,216 --> 01:01:38,854
This is fucked up.
This is going to hurt man.

634
01:01:42,405 --> 01:01:43,127
Come on.

635
01:01:43,227 --> 01:01:45,693
Guys, let's get him
back to the camper. Come on.

636
01:01:45,793 --> 01:01:48,166
Come on, follow me. Look out, look out.

637
01:01:49,897 --> 01:01:52,172
Here. There's a path, there's a path.

638
01:01:53,634 --> 01:01:55,949
- Follow me.
- Fuck.

639
01:01:57,772 --> 01:02:00,349
Here we go. Come on.

640
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:02,449
Ready?

641
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:07,415
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
- Be careful, be careful.

642
01:02:10,042 --> 01:02:11,485
I got you.

643
01:02:11,585 --> 01:02:12,620
- Okay, buddy.
- I got you.

644
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:14,063
Here. Give him some water.

645
01:02:18,392 --> 01:02:21,428
Guys, we should have just gone
to the fucking beach.

646
01:02:23,792 --> 01:02:26,367
That's my phone.
That's my phone. Holy shit.

647
01:02:26,467 --> 01:02:29,871
- Uncle Bob. Uncle Bob.
- Brian? Where the heck are you? Where's Matt?

648
01:02:29,971 --> 01:02:32,607
Matt's with us. He's hurt.
We're out at the woods. We're at the cabin.

649
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:34,943
I'm at the cabin. I can't hear you.
You're at the cabin?

650
01:02:35,043 --> 01:02:39,030
- We're in a camper that's near the 212.
- Brian, can you hear me?

651
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:41,683
Hello? Hello?

652
01:02:41,983 --> 01:02:44,052
- I fucking lost it again. All right...
- Fuck!

653
01:02:44,152 --> 01:02:46,320
All right,
I'm going to try to fucking redial.

654
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:49,557
Come on, come on, come on.
You got it? You get him?

655
01:02:49,657 --> 01:02:54,194
No, no. It's out again.
He says he's at the cabin. He's close.

656
01:02:54,294 --> 01:02:55,964
- Fuck.
- Fuck!

657
01:02:56,064 --> 01:02:59,767
- Jesus fucking Christ, dude.
- My bad man.

658
01:02:59,867 --> 01:03:03,036
Okay, so, he's coming, right?

659
01:03:03,136 --> 01:03:04,805
- He's on the way, right?
- He's... I don't know. It cut off.

660
01:03:04,905 --> 01:03:07,775
- I told him we were in a trailer by the 212.
- Give me your phone. I'll keep calling it.

661
01:03:07,875 --> 01:03:13,547
All right, guys. All right, I got it.
Okay, okay. Fireworks.

662
01:03:13,647 --> 01:03:15,549
Check it out, check it out.
I can light off fireworks.

663
01:03:15,649 --> 01:03:18,853
- It's fucking daylight out there, dude.
- So the fuck what? It's better than nothing.

664
01:03:18,953 --> 01:03:22,189
If he hears them or he sees them,
he'll know where we are.

665
01:03:22,808 --> 01:03:25,135
Okay, okay.

666
01:03:28,129 --> 01:03:30,097
- Okay.
- Yeah?

667
01:03:30,197 --> 01:03:32,421
Yeah. I'm going.

668
01:03:32,521 --> 01:03:34,811
Let's go, let's go!

669
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:42,982
Come on, buddy.

670
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:50,218
This better fucking work.
I'm going to fucking light these fireworks,

671
01:03:50,318 --> 01:03:53,788
signal Uncle Bob, save Matt, the end.

672
01:03:53,888 --> 01:03:58,569
Here we go, guys. Here we go.
This is a good spot. Come on.

673
01:03:59,393 --> 01:04:03,798
Fuck, fuck, fuck. Ready? Ready?
Hey, boy, this is for you.

674
01:04:03,898 --> 01:04:06,744
Buy you a whole lot of shit. Come on.

675
01:04:09,436 --> 01:04:11,038
What the fuck?

676
01:04:11,338 --> 01:04:12,640
Oh, shit!

677
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,778
Shit. Holy cow.

678
01:04:16,944 --> 01:04:18,579
- Is that them?
- Yeah.

679
01:04:18,679 --> 01:04:21,315
- You can actually see them.
- I told you this would work.

680
01:04:21,415 --> 01:04:24,318
He did it. He did it.

681
01:04:24,518 --> 01:04:27,087
We got help coming for you, Matty boy.

682
01:04:27,735 --> 01:04:30,831
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

683
01:04:32,032 --> 01:04:33,386
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

684
01:04:34,775 --> 01:04:35,804
Come on, Todd.

685
01:04:37,798 --> 01:04:39,600
There he is. Oh, fuck!

686
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,936
Yo, he's coming!

687
01:04:45,948 --> 01:04:46,957
Oh, my god!

688
01:04:48,309 --> 01:04:50,478
Get off me, man!
Get off me, motherfucker!

689
01:04:50,578 --> 01:04:52,345
Get off me, bitch!

690
01:04:55,716 --> 01:04:57,351
Get off me!

691
01:04:57,551 --> 01:04:59,486
No, no, no, no, no!

692
01:05:01,355 --> 01:05:03,624
We have to help him!

693
01:05:03,924 --> 01:05:07,995
Get this motherfucker off me, man!
Get him off me! Help!

694
01:05:18,939 --> 01:05:20,441
Okay, okay, okay.

695
01:05:25,413 --> 01:05:27,163
Holy shit.

696
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:32,924
I can't see him.
He took him into the woods.

697
01:05:34,422 --> 01:05:36,791
What are we going to do with Matt?

698
01:05:37,091 --> 01:05:39,835
Oh, shit. Oh, fuck.

699
01:05:47,501 --> 01:05:49,937
Stop crying, stop crying.

700
01:05:59,146 --> 01:06:02,370
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

701
01:06:11,959 --> 01:06:14,228
Shut up, shut up.

702
01:06:14,328 --> 01:06:15,332
Be quiet.

703
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,742
Oh, fuck. Oh, shit.

704
01:06:30,377 --> 01:06:31,494
Matt, wake up!

705
01:06:31,813 --> 01:06:33,658
He's pushing us towards the edge!

706
01:06:35,649 --> 01:06:37,284
He's pushing us.
He's trying to push us over.

707
01:06:37,384 --> 01:06:39,754
Come on, Matt. Come on, buddy.

708
01:06:42,590 --> 01:06:44,564
Come on, Matt.

709
01:06:46,493 --> 01:06:48,028
Oh, shit.

710
01:06:48,128 --> 01:06:49,943
Shit!

711
01:07:24,965 --> 01:07:27,971
Matt. Matt, wake up.

712
01:07:29,336 --> 01:07:31,672
Wake up, Matt. We got to go home.

713
01:07:32,713 --> 01:07:34,351
Matt!

714
01:07:36,477 --> 01:07:38,082
Dora.

715
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:46,587
Hey, hey.

716
01:07:52,393 --> 01:07:54,261
Dora, Dora.

717
01:07:57,764 --> 01:07:59,405
Oh, shit.

718
01:08:01,068 --> 01:08:02,745
No! No!

719
01:08:20,021 --> 01:08:21,576
Oh, shit.

720
01:11:11,158 --> 01:11:15,028
Guys... Dora. Dora.

721
01:11:15,128 --> 01:11:16,863
Wake up.

722
01:11:16,963 --> 01:11:18,530
Guys?

723
01:11:23,604 --> 01:11:25,391
No.

724
01:11:29,576 --> 01:11:31,778
I'm sorry, guys.

725
01:11:34,681 --> 01:11:38,385
We gotta go. We gotta go.
It's gonna come back. Come on.

726
01:11:38,485 --> 01:11:42,156
Please, come on, guys. Come on, guys.

727
01:11:43,156 --> 01:11:44,961
Oh, shit.

728
01:11:47,928 --> 01:11:49,737
Holy shit.

729
01:11:50,397 --> 01:11:52,251
Oh...

730
01:11:57,804 --> 01:11:59,677
That's it.

731
01:12:00,341 --> 01:12:02,175
That's it.

732
01:12:12,185 --> 01:12:15,322
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It was an accident.

733
01:12:21,595 --> 01:12:22,906
We didn't mean to.

734
01:12:25,231 --> 01:12:28,475
We didn't mean to kill your baby.

735
01:12:29,369 --> 01:12:32,163
We didn't mean to kill your baby!

736
01:12:44,585 --> 01:12:47,213
- Brian?!
- Uncle Bob! Uncle Bob!

737
01:12:47,313 --> 01:12:50,123
- Brian!
- Uncle Bob, help!

738
01:12:50,223 --> 01:12:53,244
- Help me!
- Oh, my God.

739
01:12:53,344 --> 01:12:56,430
- Come on. I know I know.
- Brian, what'd you boys do?

740
01:12:56,530 --> 01:12:58,698
We have to get 'em!
We have to take them all.

741
01:12:58,798 --> 01:13:00,567
Come on. Come on,
we got to get out of here.

742
01:13:00,667 --> 01:13:03,003
- No, we can't leave them.
- Come on, Brian!

743
01:13:03,103 --> 01:13:05,544
- I don't want to leave them.
- Let's get to the truck.

744
01:13:05,644 --> 01:13:06,673
Okay.

745
01:13:06,873 --> 01:13:08,809
We didn't listen to you, Uncle Bob.

746
01:13:14,448 --> 01:13:16,450
It's my fault. It's all my fault.

747
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:19,490
Shut up. We'll deal with it
when we get to the truck.

748
01:13:21,655 --> 01:13:23,295
Come on.

749
01:13:25,692 --> 01:13:27,588
Uncle Bob!

750
01:13:32,566 --> 01:13:34,835
Just stop! Stop!

751
01:13:34,935 --> 01:13:37,504
Please, stop! Please!

752
01:13:37,604 --> 01:13:39,283
Please.

753
01:13:42,709 --> 01:13:44,904
It was an accident.

754
01:13:58,725 --> 01:14:00,727
I'm sorry.

755
01:14:07,768 --> 01:14:09,508
I'm done.

756
01:14:15,509 --> 01:14:17,545
This is Brian Tover.

757
01:14:20,247 --> 01:14:22,759
And this is my last video.
