My brother,

he died when I was 15.

No, there's not fear.
It was anger,

worked at the...

At a meat-packing plant
about 20 miles
outside of town.

216
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:49,236
They'd slaughter
cattle there

and supply our markets
with corn-fed organic beef.

And by the time he'd
get home, my mom would
always be asleep.

I'd lay there
on my pillow

of his boots walk

You know, I can vividly
remember my first day
at kindergarten.

355
00:32:47,696 --> 00:32:50,016
I was wearing
a light blue dress,

356
00:32:51,232 --> 00:32:53,648
and I was there no
more than 10 minutes

357
00:32:53,713 --> 00:32:56,976
before some boy asked me
what was wrong with my face.

358
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:03,231
That was the first time
I realized I had something
to be ashamed of.

You have nothing
to be ashamed of.

Stephen, you're supposed
to be impartial, remember?

361
00:33:11,696 --> 00:33:12,831
Yeah.

362
00:33:14,976 --> 00:33:18,336
Listen, I could have
a lot worse than
a birthmark covering my body.

363
00:33:21,647 --> 00:33:22,990
But that's kind of
hard to swallow

364
00:33:23,055 --> 00:33:26,351
whenever I have to
look in the mirror
to fix my hair.

365
00:33:27,856 --> 00:33:30,032
Or when I look
at my sisters.

366
00:33:31,999 --> 00:33:34,542
What that boy asked me
when I was five years old

367
00:33:34,607 --> 00:33:37,791
is what people want
to ask me every day
of my life.

368
00:33:40,464 --> 00:33:43,742
And every time I have
to meet someone
for the first time,

369
00:33:43,807 --> 00:33:46,751
I'll always be that
5-year-old girl again.

with agoraphobia.

473
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:12,190
So, you would
never leave the house.

474
00:44:12,256 --> 00:44:16,575
How did you do anything
like get food
or toilet paper?

475
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,839
Well, I was completely
dependent on my mother,

476
00:44:19,904 --> 00:44:22,558
and I had developed
a severe hatred for her.

477
00:44:24,399 --> 00:44:27,551
She was the cause
of everything
horrible in my life,

478
00:44:29,343 --> 00:44:31,166
but she was
my only friend.

479
00:44:34,623 --> 00:44:38,157
She died when I was 21.
Heart attack.

480
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,582
I never told anyone.

481
00:44:43,646 --> 00:44:48,878
I didn't call anyone.
I never had. I couldn't.

482
00:44:48,943 --> 00:44:52,222
About three weeks later,
the neighbors noticed
the smell, I guess,

483
00:44:52,287 --> 00:44:55,230
and they came over
and called an ambulance.

484
00:44:55,295 --> 00:44:58,798
After that, they came
and checked on me
quite frequently.

485
00:44:58,894 --> 00:45:00,190
It's a good thing
they did, too,

486
00:45:00,095 --> 00:45:03,821
because the day I tried
to commit suicide
they found me.

487
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:10,719
Would you mind
talking about that?

488
00:45:19,535 --> 00:45:21,710
I cut my throat
with a razor.

489
00:45:27,214 --> 00:45:29,133
I was dead
for five minutes.

490

But that's why I'm here.

491

Three years ago,
I could not step
out of my house.

492
00:45:42,302 --> 00:45:46,619
And now the world is at
my feet, and it's because
when I came back,

493
00:45:48,605 --> 00:45:50,957
I came back
completely fearless.

hard to swallow whenever...

What's going on?
Hey.

632
01:00:08,872 --> 01:00:12,198
This weird video
started playing
on the campus channel.

...a light blue dress,

634
01:00:19,128 --> 01:00:21,686
and I was there no
more than 10 minutes...

635
01:00:26,087 --> 01:00:28,247
This is on every TV
across campus right now.

I'll always be that
5-year-old girl. You know,
I can vividly remember

637
01:00:30,952 --> 01:00:32,597
my first day
at kindergarten.

638
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:34,086
...covering my body.
I had something
to be ashamed of.

639
01:00:34,150 --> 01:00:38,342
...every day of my life...
What was wrong with my face.

640
01:00:38,408 --> 01:00:41,766
What was wrong with my face.
What was wrong with my face.

Hey, watch it!

That's all right.

When I... When I was
reviewing your tape,

648
01:01:48,645 --> 01:01:51,974
I realized there were
a few more questions
we should have asked you.

649
01:01:52,039 --> 01:01:56,292
Your interview was so
compelling I didn't wanna
leave any stone unturned.

650
01:01:58,597 --> 01:02:00,468
Stephen and Cheryl
not here?

No, they couldn't
make it tonight.

Can I get
you a drink?

789
01:17:57,661 --> 01:17:58,972
Quaid.

790
01:18:04,989 --> 01:18:06,428
Sorry, Quaid.

791
01:18:09,533 --> 01:18:10,683
Sorry.

792
01:18:14,046 --> 01:18:15,739
Whatever I did,

793
01:18:18,877 --> 01:18:20,188
I'm sorry.

794
01:18:21,790 --> 01:18:23,835
Please just let me out.

795
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:26,475
Please.

796
01:18:29,772 --> 01:18:31,019
I'm sorry.

797
01:19:16,715 --> 01:19:19,497
It startled me how
suddenly she gave in.

798
01:19:20,235 --> 01:19:22,906
Fuck...

799
01:19:22,971 --> 01:19:26,794
She sat in the middle of
the room and ate the meat
down to the bone.

800
01:19:26,892 --> 01:19:28,330
Just like that.

801
01:19:35,994 --> 01:19:37,609
Where did she go?

802
01:19:39,161 --> 01:19:41,641
Well, she wandered downstairs.
She came into the kitchen,

803
01:19:41,706 --> 01:19:43,385
drank several
glasses of water.

804
01:19:43,403 --> 01:19:45,914
Then she sat on a chair
for three or four hours,

805
01:19:45,978 --> 01:19:48,569
and then I cooked
her something to eat,
potatoes, and then she left.

806
01:19:48,634 --> 01:19:52,314
You're fucking lying.
I know it.
Where is she?

807
01:19:52,379 --> 01:19:55,689
Look, if it'll make
you feel any better,
check the house.

808
01:19:55,754 --> 01:19:56,938

809
01:19:59,609 --> 01:20:00,600
Who's with you?

810
01:20:00,664 --> 01:20:02,393
No one. Cut me...
Cut me out.

811
01:20:02,459 --> 01:20:04,473
Come on,
cut me out, cut me out.
Hurry the fuck up, Quaid.

812

01:22:44,709 --> 01:22:46,485

QUAID: Watching the fear
of death, the pinnacle of
all dread approach,

818
01:25:22,993 --> 01:25:25,762
that was the limits.

819
01:25:25,826 --> 01:25:29,697
Someone once
wrote that no man
can know his own death.

820
01:25:29,761 --> 01:25:33,056
But to know the death
of others, intimately,

821
01:25:33,121 --> 01:25:38,544
to watch the tricks that
the mind would surely perform
to avoid the bitter truth,

822
01:25:38,610 --> 01:25:41,712
that was a clue to
death's nature, wasn't it?

823
01:25:43,985 --> 01:25:47,552
That might, in some
small way, prepare
a man for his own death.

824
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:05,089
To live another's dread
vicariously was the safest,

825
01:26:05,153 --> 01:26:07,392
cleverest way to
touch the beast.

01:26:29,009 --> 01:26:32,030
Steve. No!

828
01:26:33,087 --> 01:26:35,022
No, Steve.

829
01:26:44,928 --> 01:26:47,679
Let's see how
hungry you have to be
to get through that.

830
01:26:48,848 --> 01:26:49,823
No.

831
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:55,935
No!

832
