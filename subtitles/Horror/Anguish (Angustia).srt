1
00:01:33,741 --> 00:01:35,451
<i>What's the matter?</i>

2
00:01:35,576 --> 00:01:36,744
<i>Tommy!</i>

3
00:01:37,203 --> 00:01:38,204
<i>Tommy!</i>

4
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:39,622
Tommy!

5
00:01:40,456 --> 00:01:41,457
Hi!

6
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:43,876
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy!

7
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:44,960
Hey!

8
00:01:45,669 --> 00:01:46,754
Hey.

9
00:01:51,258 --> 00:01:52,259
<i>Tommy.</i>

10
00:01:52,885 --> 00:01:53,969
<i>Tommy...</i>

11
00:01:54,845 --> 00:01:57,014
What are you doing here?

12
00:01:57,139 --> 00:01:59,058
Come to Mother.

13
00:02:06,023 --> 00:02:11,445
John! One of the snails has gotten out!
Could you put it back with the others?

14
00:02:11,821 --> 00:02:14,448
Okay! I'm coming, Mother.

15
00:02:20,955 --> 00:02:25,626
Goddamn! One of my birds got out!

16
00:02:25,751 --> 00:02:29,630
Catch him! What were you doing with
him out of the cage?

17
00:02:29,755 --> 00:02:34,802
- No one likes to be caged in.
- You can't trust them for a minute!

18
00:02:36,428 --> 00:02:38,180
Feed him!

19
00:02:42,268 --> 00:02:44,311
Come on, come on!
Get back here!

20
00:02:45,771 --> 00:02:47,314
Come here!

21
00:02:49,483 --> 00:02:52,111
Be careful with the table!

22
00:02:52,236 --> 00:02:55,739
Catch him! Don't let him go
into the kitchen!

23
00:03:00,786 --> 00:03:03,247
Hurry! Catch him!

24
00:03:07,793 --> 00:03:10,337
Hurry! Catch him!

25
00:03:14,717 --> 00:03:16,385
Catch him!

26
00:03:17,887 --> 00:03:21,182
Be careful with the lamp!
Now where's he going?

27
00:03:24,685 --> 00:03:26,729
John! Hurry!

28
00:03:26,854 --> 00:03:31,025
You're in a lot of trouble.

29
00:03:35,446 --> 00:03:40,117
What are you doing? Get down from
there! You're going to fall!

30
00:03:43,078 --> 00:03:46,707
The bird is stuck behind the cupboard.
I can't reach him.

31
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:51,295
You've got to force him out. You can
do it. Get down!

32
00:03:57,259 --> 00:03:58,427
Listen!

33
00:04:01,013 --> 00:04:02,264
He's moving.

34
00:04:03,224 --> 00:04:06,310
You stay here. I'll be right back.

35
00:04:20,533 --> 00:04:21,534
Here.

36
00:04:22,493 --> 00:04:23,869
Use this.

37
00:04:26,622 --> 00:04:29,834
Be careful. Don't hurt him.

38
00:04:33,087 --> 00:04:35,131
Don't force it.

39
00:04:42,555 --> 00:04:44,223
Be careful!

40
00:04:44,348 --> 00:04:46,225
Don't hurt him.

41
00:04:47,226 --> 00:04:49,186
Slowly.

42
00:05:02,032 --> 00:05:06,871
- I've got him, Ma! I've got him, Mother!
- Be careful! Don't hurt him.

43
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,331
Slowly.

44
00:05:11,876 --> 00:05:13,461
Slowly.

45
00:05:15,463 --> 00:05:19,049
He won't get away again. He knows
he can't hide from me.

46
00:05:19,049 --> 00:05:23,596
Now, give him to me, John.
Give him to me.

47
00:05:24,013 --> 00:05:26,390
Give him to me, John.

48
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:33,189
You did a good job, John.
John is a good boy.

49
00:05:33,564 --> 00:05:37,026
You mustn't run off like that, Tommy.

50
00:05:37,818 --> 00:05:40,905
You're very, very bad!

51
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:44,742
See what happens when
you disobey Mother.

52
00:05:56,295 --> 00:05:58,923
It's a very rare genetic chain

53
00:05:59,006 --> 00:06:01,842
which causes the distinctive
characteristics

54
00:06:01,967 --> 00:06:05,930
and the unique shape of this kind of
retinal activity.

55
00:06:06,055 --> 00:06:08,140
This is one of the rarest examples.

56
00:06:08,265 --> 00:06:10,684
It's from Mr. Murphy's grandfather's
collection

57
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,479
which was started at the turn of the
century.

58
00:06:13,562 --> 00:06:17,483
The Murphy family has continued to
add to the collection until today.

59
00:06:17,608 --> 00:06:22,613
The collection includes samples from
every country in the world.

60
00:06:22,988 --> 00:06:27,326
Obviously, the collection is only shown
to doctors and graduates for research,

61
00:06:27,451 --> 00:06:30,329
under special permission by the Murphys.

62
00:06:30,412 --> 00:06:34,458
Mr. Pressman is our orderly in charge
of its maintenance.

63
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,876
Pressman!

64
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:40,840
What are you doing over there?
Bring me the key.

65
00:06:41,257 --> 00:06:42,508
Sorry, doctor.

66
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:19,420
I can't get used to these lenses.
They hurt.

67
00:07:21,046 --> 00:07:25,551
Don't worry. It's quite normal for them
to feel uncomfortable at first.

68
00:07:25,676 --> 00:07:28,345
These drops will help.

69
00:07:30,055 --> 00:07:33,100
Please get them out of my eyes.

70
00:07:33,225 --> 00:07:37,188
I can't stand it! They're cutting into
my eyes! Take them out!

71
00:07:37,313 --> 00:07:42,024
Are you deaf? I told you to take
these things out of my eye!

72
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,594
They're hurting me!

73
00:07:43,694 --> 00:07:46,238
- Take them out!
- Please, please.

74
00:07:46,363 --> 00:07:49,909
Don't get upset. I promise they'll stop
hurting in a few minutes.

75
00:07:49,992 --> 00:07:51,952
Take them out! Do you hear me?

76
00:07:52,077 --> 00:07:54,538
You wear them! You need them
more than I do!

77
00:07:54,663 --> 00:07:57,792
No. I'm not allowed. My mother would...

78
00:07:57,917 --> 00:07:58,959
Excuse me.

79
00:07:59,084 --> 00:08:01,629
Where are you going? Come back here!

80
00:08:01,754 --> 00:08:04,215
Where is Dr. Murphy?

81
00:08:10,304 --> 00:08:16,143
<i>Get these things out of my eyes! They're
hurting. Get them out!</i>

82
00:08:16,268 --> 00:08:19,313
- Calm down please.
- How do you expect me to calm down?

83
00:08:19,438 --> 00:08:22,525
- The man is a complete nut.
- I'm sorry this happened.

84
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,152
He's very sensitive to comments about
his eyes.

85
00:08:25,277 --> 00:08:27,863
He's diabetic and he's
losing his vision.

86
00:08:27,988 --> 00:08:30,116
Then why is he working here?

87
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:34,703
I'm sorry for not getting to you sooner.
John is usually good with the patients.

88
00:08:34,829 --> 00:08:37,081
The schedule has been crazy because
of the holidays.

89
00:08:37,206 --> 00:08:41,377
I never expected such a strange person
to be working in Dr. Murphy's office.

90
00:08:41,502 --> 00:08:43,003
Not at these prices!

91
00:08:43,754 --> 00:08:47,925
Our intention is to help everyone.
In fact, his mother is one of the main...

92
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:51,178
I don't care about anyone's mother!
I'm late as it is.

93
00:08:51,303 --> 00:08:54,265
I want to see Dr. Murphy next time.

94
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:59,395
<i>In fact, his mother is one of the main...
I don't care about anyone's mother...</i>

95
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,565
<i>I want to see Dr. Murphy next time.</i>

96
00:09:03,524 --> 00:09:05,901
You can see.

97
00:09:06,777 --> 00:09:09,321
You have no idea

98
00:09:10,114 --> 00:09:13,451
what it's like to really suffer.

99
00:09:14,994 --> 00:09:17,413
But you will!

100
00:09:18,122 --> 00:09:20,040
Just wait!

101
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:24,211
You'll be sorry!

102
00:09:36,682 --> 00:09:40,144
She doesn't know how much they need you.

103
00:09:44,648 --> 00:09:47,026
John is your best boy, isn't he Mother?

104
00:09:47,151 --> 00:09:51,572
Yes, John. You're my best boy and
the best surgeon in town.

105
00:10:02,374 --> 00:10:06,962
And now, you must start thinking of
the spirals.

106
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,300
The spiral that's coming into your head.

107
00:10:11,801 --> 00:10:13,969
Think of the center.

108
00:10:14,428 --> 00:10:16,430
The center of the spiral.

109
00:10:16,972 --> 00:10:21,102
Imagine the spiral in your mind.

110
00:10:21,227 --> 00:10:25,606
Think of the center and
you'll be with me.

111
00:10:31,487 --> 00:10:32,613
All finished.

112
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,418
Slowly, my baby.

113
00:10:47,253 --> 00:10:50,464
Deep, easy breaths.

114
00:10:51,507 --> 00:10:55,302
Let your mind float into space.

115
00:10:56,637 --> 00:11:00,766
Feel the power and flow of your heart.

116
00:11:01,434 --> 00:11:02,852
Relax.

117
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,355
You can feel it.

118
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:10,317
Your eyelids are heavy.

119
00:11:10,734 --> 00:11:13,654
Your eyes are closed

120
00:11:13,904 --> 00:11:17,241
and you cannot open them.

121
00:11:18,117 --> 00:11:23,164
Your blood is rushing from
your heart to your head.

122
00:11:24,331 --> 00:11:30,838
Feel it. Your head is filling up
with blood.

123
00:11:31,922 --> 00:11:33,299
Good.

124
00:11:34,216 --> 00:11:39,472
Now your blood is flowing from your
head back to your heart.

125
00:11:39,597 --> 00:11:43,601
Feel it! It makes you strong!

126
00:11:43,726 --> 00:11:51,400
Feel it! It makes you strong!
Feel it! It makes you strong!

127
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:54,904
Feel it! It makes you strong!

128
00:11:54,904 --> 00:11:59,325
Now you are with Mommy as one.

129
00:12:00,242 --> 00:12:02,620
Like before.

130
00:12:02,745 --> 00:12:06,832
Together as one.

131
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:11,754
For years you were like a snail.

132
00:12:12,254 --> 00:12:15,549
Hiding, happy.

133
00:12:15,674 --> 00:12:18,719
<i>Hiding, happy.</i>

134
00:12:19,887 --> 00:12:23,015
<i>Hiding, happy.</i>

135
00:12:23,307 --> 00:12:27,186
<i>Hiding, happy.</i>

136
00:12:27,561 --> 00:12:31,565
<i>Hiding, happy.</i>

137
00:12:43,619 --> 00:12:45,621
Go get the buzzer!

138
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,752
It's impossible to get ready like this.

139
00:12:52,044 --> 00:12:54,213
<i>- Yeah?
- Ms. Robinson?</i>

140
00:12:54,338 --> 00:12:56,132
<i>Just a minute. Who is this?</i>

141
00:12:56,215 --> 00:12:59,385
My name is John Pressman.
I'm from Dr. Murphy's office.

142
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:04,140
There's been a mistake. Ms. Robinson
took the wrong pair of contact lenses.

143
00:13:04,265 --> 00:13:07,226
<i>That sounds like her. Come in.</i>

144
00:13:29,457 --> 00:13:30,791
Come in.

145
00:13:32,126 --> 00:13:34,086
What do you want?

146
00:13:34,503 --> 00:13:37,047
I told you it's about Ms. Robinson's
contact lenses.

147
00:13:37,173 --> 00:13:39,884
I see. Aren't you working late tonight?

148
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:42,011
Caroline, it's for you!

149
00:13:42,845 --> 00:13:44,096
Who is it?

150
00:13:44,221 --> 00:13:45,973
He's from Murphy's.

151
00:13:46,098 --> 00:13:47,975
Oh, no! You!

152
00:13:48,434 --> 00:13:51,604
- What do you want?
- I'm sorry to bother you so late.

153
00:13:51,729 --> 00:13:54,398
You were right to complain about
those lenses.

154
00:13:54,523 --> 00:13:56,442
They gave you the wrong ones.

155
00:13:56,567 --> 00:14:00,821
I brought the right pair with me. I'd
be glad to put them in for you.

156
00:14:00,946 --> 00:14:03,741
No, no, no. Not now.

157
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,494
I just finished putting my makeup on.

158
00:14:06,619 --> 00:14:08,496
I'll go to the clinic tomorrow.

159
00:14:08,496 --> 00:14:09,872
Come on, honey.

160
00:14:09,997 --> 00:14:13,375
I want to see you with the contacts on.
You'll look gorgeous!

161
00:14:13,501 --> 00:14:17,421
- I really don't have a lot of time.
- It'll only take a few minutes.

162
00:14:17,546 --> 00:14:22,218
I promise there's nothing to worry about.
These are your exact measurements.

163
00:14:22,343 --> 00:14:24,345
They won't hurt at all.

164
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,973
Oh, alright. But hurry, we're
late as it is.

165
00:14:35,356 --> 00:14:37,483
Now, you won't feel a thing. I promise.

166
00:14:37,566 --> 00:14:40,986
I hope not after what happened
this morning.

167
00:14:55,584 --> 00:14:58,295
You're right. It didn't hurt.

168
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,924
You know how sorry I am for what
happened this morning.

169
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:06,846
I appreciate the fact that you didn't
say anything to Dr. Murphy about it.

170
00:15:06,971 --> 00:15:10,349
I really appreciate it a lot.

171
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:15,229
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I really appreciate it.

172
00:15:46,302 --> 00:15:47,553
Caroline?

173
00:16:08,407 --> 00:16:09,408
Caroline?

174
00:16:14,413 --> 00:16:15,748
Caroline?

175
00:16:28,636 --> 00:16:30,096
Caroline?

176
00:16:43,609 --> 00:16:45,486
Oh my God!

177
00:16:46,654 --> 00:16:48,614
Caroline! Caroline!

178
00:17:00,292 --> 00:17:02,336
You're crazy!

179
00:18:15,284 --> 00:18:16,452
Hello?

180
00:18:16,535 --> 00:18:18,037
<i>- Mrs. Pressman?
- Yes?</i>

181
00:18:18,162 --> 00:18:22,666
<i>This is Marnie from Dr. Murphy's office.
He asked me about making an appointment</i>

182
00:18:22,792 --> 00:18:25,586
<i>for your eyes. Mrs. Pressman?</i>

183
00:18:27,213 --> 00:18:34,303
<i>We like John and appreciate his effort,
but lately he's been a little strange...</i>

184
00:18:34,678 --> 00:18:39,642
I understand the situation completely!
You needn't worry about John

185
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:41,977
returning to your hospital.

186
00:18:42,103 --> 00:18:46,232
Dr. Murphy knows that John is the best
surgeon he's ever seen!

187
00:18:46,357 --> 00:18:48,109
<i>He's an orderly!</i>

188
00:18:53,405 --> 00:18:57,034
You don't want him anymore.

189
00:18:58,494 --> 00:19:01,205
Jealousy!

190
00:19:02,414 --> 00:19:05,292
You will all pay for this!

191
00:19:06,085 --> 00:19:10,631
Now John go for those guys!

192
00:19:10,756 --> 00:19:12,383
Don't stop!

193
00:19:12,508 --> 00:19:15,928
Go on! Go on!

194
00:19:16,053 --> 00:19:19,849
Go on! Go on!

195
00:19:20,266 --> 00:19:23,352
<i>Go on! Go on!</i>

196
00:19:23,477 --> 00:19:26,897
<i>Go on! Go on!</i>

197
00:19:27,606 --> 00:19:29,984
<i>Go on!</i>

198
00:19:53,757 --> 00:19:55,885
Did you see that?

199
00:19:56,469 --> 00:19:58,220
Yeah, so what?

200
00:19:59,889 --> 00:20:00,848
Gross!

201
00:20:01,474 --> 00:20:03,058
So disgusting.

202
00:20:04,393 --> 00:20:06,312
Shut up and watch!

203
00:20:11,192 --> 00:20:13,319
I was really scared.

204
00:20:16,363 --> 00:20:17,448
Crazy!

205
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:26,791
<i>That's right, John.</i>

206
00:20:30,377 --> 00:20:32,379
<i>That's right.</i>

207
00:20:32,505 --> 00:20:35,758
<i>John's a good boy.</i>

208
00:20:35,883 --> 00:20:39,762
<i>Go on! Go on!</i>

209
00:20:39,887 --> 00:20:42,014
<i>Go on!</i>

210
00:20:42,098 --> 00:20:44,058
<i>Go on!</i>

211
00:20:44,183 --> 00:20:46,227
<i>Go on!</i>

212
00:20:59,532 --> 00:21:01,909
It's too much.

213
00:21:05,704 --> 00:21:08,874
Don't worry about it.
It's only a movie.

214
00:21:08,999 --> 00:21:11,127
It's only a movie.

215
00:21:11,252 --> 00:21:13,921
All those eyes! All this blood!

216
00:21:14,046 --> 00:21:16,715
It's making me dizzy.

217
00:21:21,011 --> 00:21:23,180
This guy is really sick.

218
00:21:24,181 --> 00:21:26,642
What the hell is he going to do?

219
00:21:28,394 --> 00:21:29,979
Oh, my.

220
00:21:31,147 --> 00:21:34,150
Stop with that!

221
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,115
It's this film.

222
00:21:42,867 --> 00:21:46,537
I don't want to see this.
It's making me sick!

223
00:21:49,665 --> 00:21:52,418
Linda, I want to leave.

224
00:21:56,589 --> 00:21:59,175
Never again. You're one big baby.

225
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:03,179
There's something about this guy that
gives me the creeps.

226
00:22:03,304 --> 00:22:06,474
Come, on. This is fun.
He's an eye hunter.

227
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,142
You're serious?

228
00:22:08,851 --> 00:22:10,853
You think this is funny?

229
00:22:11,771 --> 00:22:14,440
- It's disgusting!
- Oh, come on!

230
00:22:14,857 --> 00:22:18,527
Next time I'll take you
to a Disney movie.

231
00:22:19,487 --> 00:22:20,571
Please.

232
00:22:22,281 --> 00:22:24,825
I want to leave. I'm serious.

233
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:27,536
Tough. I don't.

234
00:22:49,642 --> 00:22:52,269
My eyes are really hurting!

235
00:22:53,187 --> 00:22:55,189
I can't see.

236
00:22:55,564 --> 00:22:57,900
Are you going to blame this
on the movie too?

237
00:22:58,025 --> 00:23:03,280
Mama Bear has the same problem with her
contacts. Take them out.

238
00:23:06,283 --> 00:23:07,576
John!

239
00:23:12,373 --> 00:23:15,918
Linda! Have you got a Kleenex?

240
00:23:16,001 --> 00:23:20,047
For the last time, stop bugging me!

241
00:23:25,177 --> 00:23:26,429
Mama,

242
00:23:27,221 --> 00:23:28,931
I don't feel...

243
00:23:30,391 --> 00:23:32,476
My head hurts.

244
00:23:33,227 --> 00:23:35,855
Let those eyes go!

245
00:23:36,313 --> 00:23:38,816
They let you go from the hospital.

246
00:23:38,941 --> 00:23:42,486
From now on, all the eyes of the city
will be ours!

247
00:23:42,611 --> 00:23:46,699
All the eyes of the city will be ours!

248
00:23:49,702 --> 00:23:53,497
<i>All the eyes of the city will be ours!</i>

249
00:23:54,165 --> 00:23:59,336
<i>All the eyes of the city will be ours!</i>

250
00:24:03,132 --> 00:24:07,261
<i>All the eyes of the city will be ours!</i>

251
00:24:07,887 --> 00:24:13,142
<i>All the eyes of the city will be ours!</i>

252
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:23,360
- I still feel dizzy, Mother.
- Eat! Eat! Eat! You need energy!

253
00:24:23,486 --> 00:24:26,781
There's a knife. Good boy!

254
00:24:26,906 --> 00:24:30,242
Very good! Do as I tell you always.

255
00:24:30,367 --> 00:24:33,287
Put your hand over your heart.

256
00:24:33,412 --> 00:24:38,167
Feel the power!
Blood is still in your head.

257
00:24:38,501 --> 00:24:43,088
Slowly it empties to
return to your heart.

258
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:45,800
Your with Mother now.

259
00:24:45,925 --> 00:24:49,220
You want to go back, don't you?

260
00:24:49,553 --> 00:24:53,015
Mommy will open the door.

261
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:56,477
See the eye!

262
00:24:57,353 --> 00:24:59,939
Slowly, my baby.

263
00:25:00,064 --> 00:25:03,317
Deep, easy breaths.

264
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:08,781
Let your mind float into space.

265
00:25:09,448 --> 00:25:13,702
<i>Feel the power and flow of your heart.</i>

266
00:25:14,578 --> 00:25:15,996
<i>Relax.</i>

267
00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:19,208
<i>See the light.</i>

268
00:25:20,835 --> 00:25:23,629
<i>The light beyond.</i>

269
00:25:25,881 --> 00:25:27,341
First,

270
00:25:32,054 --> 00:25:34,473
White to black.

271
00:25:35,683 --> 00:25:38,269
Black to white.

272
00:25:39,103 --> 00:25:41,814
One and two...

273
00:25:42,606 --> 00:25:46,318
and two are one.

274
00:25:46,819 --> 00:25:49,613
Your eyelids are heavy.

275
00:25:50,406 --> 00:25:53,159
<i>Your eyes are closed</i>

276
00:25:53,284 --> 00:25:56,871
<i>and you cannot open them.</i>

277
00:25:57,288 --> 00:26:00,624
<i>The blood is rushing from your heart</i>

278
00:26:00,749 --> 00:26:02,835
<i>to your head.</i>

279
00:26:03,752 --> 00:26:05,713
<i>Feel it!</i>

280
00:26:05,838 --> 00:26:10,676
<i>Your head is filling up with blood!</i>

281
00:26:13,596 --> 00:26:19,143
<i>Now the blood is flowing from your head
back to your heart.</i>

282
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,855
<i>Feel it! It makes you strong!</i>

283
00:26:24,231 --> 00:26:25,566
<i>Right</i>

284
00:26:26,066 --> 00:26:27,276
<i>left.</i>

285
00:26:30,821 --> 00:26:32,281
<i>Come closer.</i>

286
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,119
<i>Very good.</i>

287
00:26:40,372 --> 00:26:42,833
Left to right.

288
00:26:44,293 --> 00:26:45,503
Right

289
00:26:46,587 --> 00:26:48,172
to left.

290
00:26:49,256 --> 00:26:51,092
Good.

291
00:26:52,301 --> 00:26:53,928
Slowly,

292
00:26:54,386 --> 00:26:56,222
softly.

293
00:26:58,724 --> 00:27:00,976
<i>Follow the light!</i>

294
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:03,979
<i>Follow the light!</i>

295
00:27:04,396 --> 00:27:06,732
<i>Very good.</i>

296
00:27:07,066 --> 00:27:09,693
Honey, what's the matter?

297
00:27:10,569 --> 00:27:12,696
Are you okay?

298
00:27:13,405 --> 00:27:15,658
I feel dizzy too.

299
00:27:17,243 --> 00:27:20,871
I don't know what's happening to me.

300
00:27:21,288 --> 00:27:25,292
Why don't you go to the lobby
for some air?

301
00:27:25,626 --> 00:27:28,170
Alone? Are you kidding?

302
00:27:28,295 --> 00:27:32,049
For years, you were like a snail.

303
00:27:32,591 --> 00:27:34,176
Hiding.

304
00:27:34,969 --> 00:27:36,429
Happy.

305
00:27:37,346 --> 00:27:40,391
Hiding. Happy.

306
00:27:40,516 --> 00:27:42,309
<i>Hiding.</i>

307
00:27:42,977 --> 00:27:44,437
<i>Happy.</i>

308
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,605
<i>Hiding.</i>

309
00:27:46,981 --> 00:27:48,899
<i>Happy.</i>

310
00:27:49,275 --> 00:27:50,484
<i>Hiding.</i>

311
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,236
<i>Happy.</i>

312
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:56,031
<i>One and two</i>

313
00:27:56,157 --> 00:27:59,994
<i>and two are one.</i>

314
00:28:00,911 --> 00:28:02,621
<i>Right hand.</i>

315
00:28:03,205 --> 00:28:04,582
<i>Left hand.</i>

316
00:28:04,707 --> 00:28:07,418
This stuff really works?

317
00:28:15,551 --> 00:28:21,015
Now run! Run.
Don't stop!

318
00:28:22,892 --> 00:28:25,060
<i>Run .
Don't stop!</i>

319
00:28:36,113 --> 00:28:38,491
Run, run!

320
00:28:45,664 --> 00:28:47,041
Run!

321
00:30:49,497 --> 00:30:52,333
They are going to be very sorry, Mother.

322
00:30:54,251 --> 00:30:57,254
They're not nice people.

323
00:31:24,406 --> 00:31:27,493
Patty! Do you feel better?

324
00:31:28,244 --> 00:31:30,996
Yeah, I feel okay.

325
00:31:32,498 --> 00:31:36,377
- But I want to leave.
- Come on. I'm having fun.

326
00:31:37,044 --> 00:31:38,462
I'm not!

327
00:31:40,464 --> 00:31:42,007
Oh, no!

328
00:31:42,091 --> 00:31:45,219
Now he's going to a movie theater!

329
00:31:45,553 --> 00:31:49,056
Wow! That's going to be hot!

330
00:31:57,356 --> 00:31:58,941
One, please.

331
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:20,546
Hey you! Put the ticket in the box.

332
00:33:37,289 --> 00:33:38,666
Linda!

333
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:41,502
This is gonna be too much!

334
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:56,851
Oh, no!

335
00:33:57,935 --> 00:33:59,145
Linda.

336
00:34:01,063 --> 00:34:02,731
Be quiet!

337
00:35:50,506 --> 00:35:54,510
Linda, I really can't take this anymore.
Please let's go.

338
00:35:54,969 --> 00:35:57,096
I'm not kidding!

339
00:35:57,221 --> 00:36:00,975
Patty, give me a break. It's not real.
It's make-believe.

340
00:36:01,308 --> 00:36:05,312
Besides, if you want me to leave,
give me back my 5 dollars.

341
00:36:06,647 --> 00:36:08,691
I can't stand it!

342
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:15,322
- Okay if you want to stay, I'm leaving.
- Good for you.

343
00:36:15,448 --> 00:36:17,908
See you at school.

344
00:37:08,167 --> 00:37:11,045
Excuse me. Where is the restroom?

345
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:14,006
It's down the hall on the left.

346
00:37:18,594 --> 00:37:20,554
Hey! Are you okay?

347
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,431
Yeah.

348
00:37:25,226 --> 00:37:26,769
I'm fine.

349
00:38:04,223 --> 00:38:07,893
<i>That's right. John's a good boy.</i>

350
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:12,148
<i>Now go for those two!</i>

351
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:15,067
Go on!

352
00:38:15,734 --> 00:38:17,361
Go on!

353
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,363
Do it!

354
00:38:19,488 --> 00:38:21,198
Don't stop!

355
00:38:21,615 --> 00:38:22,825
Yes!

356
00:38:24,118 --> 00:38:25,369
Yes!

357
00:38:27,121 --> 00:38:31,041
<i>Keep going. Don't stop.</i>

358
00:38:31,167 --> 00:38:33,627
<i>Don't stop!</i>

359
00:39:00,696 --> 00:39:03,115
<i>Now seriously,</i>

360
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:07,161
<i>Mother will always take care of you.</i>

361
00:39:07,286 --> 00:39:08,871
<i>You're not alone!</i>

362
00:39:11,707 --> 00:39:14,293
<i>You're safe with me.</i>

363
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:17,213
<i>Your eyes are my eyes.</i>

364
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:22,051
<i>Your hands are my hands.</i>

365
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:31,102
I'm going to get some more popcorn.
Want anything?

366
00:39:50,538 --> 00:39:53,249
<i>You will do all that I say!</i>

367
00:39:53,332 --> 00:39:56,085
Leave me alone!

368
00:42:05,005 --> 00:42:06,090
Linda!

369
00:42:06,173 --> 00:42:08,175
Linda, he's in there!

370
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,344
What are you doing here?
I thought you left.

371
00:42:10,469 --> 00:42:13,305
- He's in there! I saw him!
- Who?

372
00:42:14,056 --> 00:42:17,935
Him! The man over there.
He's in the ladies room.

373
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:21,689
It's not him. He hasn't moved
from his seat.

374
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:32,908
Listen to me. I swear to God there's
a man in the ladies room.

375
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:35,327
Creep!

376
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:43,002
I'll do anything you say. Just go check
for yourself and see if he's there.

377
00:42:45,379 --> 00:42:49,675
You're a pain in the ass! I'm never
going to the movies with you again.

378
00:42:49,759 --> 00:42:54,638
- You're worse than my baby brother.
- Please? Just this one time.

379
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:56,432
Please?

380
00:42:56,932 --> 00:43:00,019
Alright. I have to go anyway.
I'll get some more popcorn too.

381
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:01,437
I'll go with you.

382
00:43:01,562 --> 00:43:04,857
No way! Stay here and
tell me what happens.

383
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:07,067
Linda, wait!

384
00:43:26,921 --> 00:43:30,883
Here. Have some popcorn.

385
00:45:24,872 --> 00:45:25,998
Linda...

386
00:45:38,177 --> 00:45:40,304
<i>John, come back home.</i>

387
00:45:40,846 --> 00:45:46,352
<i>You're losing me. You need my strength
again, John.</i>

388
00:45:50,064 --> 00:45:52,024
No. I'm staying, Mother.

389
00:45:52,358 --> 00:45:54,276
I can do it by myself.

390
00:45:54,401 --> 00:45:59,115
<i>Why? You can't do it alone!
Think of the spiral.</i>

391
00:45:59,198 --> 00:46:00,825
By myself.

392
00:46:02,952 --> 00:46:08,332
<i>John, think of the spirals. The center
of the spirals.</i>

393
00:46:08,791 --> 00:46:11,210
<i>The spirals...</i>

394
00:46:11,877 --> 00:46:13,129
I feel...

395
00:46:13,254 --> 00:46:15,506
<i>Remember the spirals.</i>

396
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:20,094
<i>You need me, John. You know you need me.</i>

397
00:46:20,469 --> 00:46:24,223
<i>Be with me John and do as I say.</i>

398
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:27,977
<i>Come back home before it's too late.</i>

399
00:46:36,694 --> 00:46:42,366
One, two, three, four, five, six.

400
00:46:46,912 --> 00:46:49,874
<i>Come back, come back.</i>

401
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:55,421
<i>Come back, come back.
Come back, come back.</i>

402
00:46:58,132 --> 00:47:01,552
Hi! Boy, you must know this picture
by heart. How many times...

403
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:15,983
Such a kid.

404
00:48:24,677 --> 00:48:26,720
<i>I can prove myself, Mother.</i>

405
00:48:28,222 --> 00:48:30,307
<i>I don't need you anymore.</i>

406
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:44,989
<i>I can do it alone.</i>

407
00:48:45,448 --> 00:48:48,242
Poor kid. This movie's
really getting to her.

408
00:48:48,367 --> 00:48:50,453
Yeah, it got to me too.

409
00:48:50,953 --> 00:48:53,414
She's still pretty spaced-out.

410
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:46,175
What are you doing in the ladies room?

411
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:50,304
Get out! Don't touch me!
You pervert!

412
00:49:57,019 --> 00:49:59,980
<i>I can do it by myself, Mother.</i>

413
00:50:06,529 --> 00:50:11,325
<i>Come back, I beg you! Come back!</i>

414
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:15,830
<i>Come back, come back!</i>

415
00:51:05,504 --> 00:51:07,882
Keep an eye on the register.

416
00:51:08,007 --> 00:51:09,717
Don't be too long.

417
00:51:09,842 --> 00:51:12,553
Thanks, I won't be longer than an hour.

418
00:51:29,111 --> 00:51:30,696
Anyone there?

419
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:42,249
Miss, are you alright?

420
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:50,091
My friend is in the bathroom.

421
00:51:50,216 --> 00:51:52,551
She's been gone for a long time.

422
00:51:53,636 --> 00:51:57,640
She'll be right back. Don't cry.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

423
00:51:57,765 --> 00:51:59,558
I'm scared.

424
00:52:02,603 --> 00:52:04,271
Is she okay?

425
00:52:04,396 --> 00:52:07,566
I think so, but she's crying.

426
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,680
I'd like some popcorn please.

427
00:52:45,521 --> 00:52:47,231
Are you okay?

428
00:52:47,648 --> 00:52:51,360
What were you doing in the ladies room?

429
00:52:51,485 --> 00:52:53,154
<i>Say something to her.</i>

430
00:52:53,279 --> 00:52:55,531
Maybe you should go find her friend.

431
00:52:58,117 --> 00:53:01,287
Excuse me, Miss. Maybe I can help you.

432
00:53:01,412 --> 00:53:05,291
What's your friend's name?
I'll go look for her.

433
00:53:06,375 --> 00:53:08,210
Linda.

434
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:13,841
Mother.

435
00:53:18,763 --> 00:53:19,805
Mother.

436
00:53:27,062 --> 00:53:31,150
Just stay in your seat and I'll
have your friend back.

437
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:45,372
It's alright. Don't worry.

438
00:53:46,499 --> 00:53:49,126
My husband went to get your friend.

439
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:52,421
Hello?

440
00:54:03,724 --> 00:54:05,184
Excuse me?

441
00:54:05,893 --> 00:54:07,186
Excuse me?

442
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:17,780
Excuse me? Hello?

443
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,574
Hello?

444
00:54:21,867 --> 00:54:23,577
Is there anybody in here?

445
00:54:35,756 --> 00:54:40,344
Don't be silly. She's probably talking
to some cute guy in the lobby.

446
00:54:40,428 --> 00:54:41,804
You'll see.

447
00:55:03,284 --> 00:55:05,327
You won't see.

448
00:56:42,675 --> 00:56:44,844
Don't worry, Mother.

449
00:56:45,469 --> 00:56:47,721
I won't leave.

450
00:56:48,889 --> 00:56:50,891
Don't worry, Mother.

451
00:56:54,937 --> 00:56:56,439
Nobody...

452
00:56:57,481 --> 00:56:58,816
will...

453
00:57:06,198 --> 00:57:08,492
Calm down, calm down.

454
00:57:27,762 --> 00:57:30,848
No one is going to leave here.

455
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:33,100
No one.

456
00:58:11,806 --> 00:58:15,476
Don't worry, Mother. I won't leave.
Nobody will.

457
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:17,561
Nobody will.

458
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:28,489
I love you, Mother.

459
00:58:45,214 --> 00:58:49,051
- Please! You have to help me!
- Excuse me?

460
00:58:49,969 --> 00:58:51,595
My friend's in the theater!

461
00:58:51,929 --> 00:58:54,390
There's a murderer in there! I saw him!

462
00:59:06,068 --> 00:59:09,071
Hey! What are you doing?

463
00:59:10,114 --> 00:59:12,700
Oh my God! Mary!

464
00:59:14,952 --> 00:59:17,580
Are you...are you crazy?

465
00:59:26,046 --> 00:59:27,506
But you have to help!

466
00:59:27,631 --> 00:59:29,842
I'd like to help, but I can't.

467
00:59:29,967 --> 00:59:33,971
But you can't leave!
He's killing people!

468
00:59:34,513 --> 00:59:36,348
Hello, police?

469
00:59:39,518 --> 00:59:44,607
There's a madman in the theater!
He tried to kill me!

470
00:59:57,495 --> 00:59:58,496
<i>Hurry!</i>

471
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,501
<i>Emergency! Calling all cars...</i>

472
01:00:03,793 --> 01:00:07,004
- I'll be right back.
- Don't leave.

473
01:00:07,129 --> 01:00:10,007
Just be a minute. Stay put.

474
01:00:31,403 --> 01:00:33,155
...he's killing people!
We need to get help!

475
01:00:33,155 --> 01:00:36,909
Tell me where your friend is and
I'll see if she needs any help.

476
01:00:37,034 --> 01:00:42,123
In the theater! There's a man going
around killing people!

477
01:00:42,248 --> 01:00:43,916
I'm sure you're mistaken.

478
01:00:48,045 --> 01:00:51,924
<i>- Mama.
- Come home!</i>

479
01:01:19,243 --> 01:01:22,037
I'm going to kill you, you bastard!

480
01:01:35,342 --> 01:01:40,306
- Quiet! Where are you going?
- I want some candy.

481
01:02:05,915 --> 01:02:07,083
Quiet.

482
01:02:21,097 --> 01:02:24,391
Laura, what's the matter? Laura!

483
01:02:25,893 --> 01:02:27,686
Oh no!

484
01:02:32,108 --> 01:02:36,403
Look! There's a man in the projection
booth! Come on!

485
01:02:44,078 --> 01:02:47,665
Stop crying. It'll be alright.
Don't worry.

486
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:52,044
There's no way out!
No one's gonna leave!

487
01:03:02,972 --> 01:03:06,684
- I'll go inside and look around.
- Don't go!

488
01:03:18,612 --> 01:03:24,577
<i>- I've given you everything you ever...
- Mother, please. Take me home.</i>

489
01:03:24,702 --> 01:03:27,913
I'll be a good boy.

490
01:03:28,956 --> 01:03:32,793
<i>You've got my power and my energy!</i>

491
01:03:33,669 --> 01:03:39,341
You idiot! How can you do anything
without me!

492
01:03:39,425 --> 01:03:42,303
Come back before it's too late!

493
01:03:46,474 --> 01:03:47,892
Bastard.

494
01:04:05,534 --> 01:04:07,078
My God.

495
01:04:12,708 --> 01:04:15,336
Let's go find a phone booth.

496
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:22,468
Mother?

497
01:04:24,512 --> 01:04:26,764
I'll be a good boy.

498
01:04:26,889 --> 01:04:30,351
<i>John, don't do this to me!
Think of the spiral!</i>

499
01:04:30,476 --> 01:04:32,603
<i>That's going to help you!</i>

500
01:04:32,937 --> 01:04:39,235
<i>And the snails, John!
Remember we owe it to them, John!</i>

501
01:04:48,077 --> 01:04:54,583
John! Leave this instant!
I demand you leave the theater!

502
01:05:10,766 --> 01:05:14,311
<i>Why, John, why?</i>

503
01:05:14,854 --> 01:05:18,107
Get away, fly away!

504
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:27,533
<i>Fly, fly, fly!</i>

505
01:06:34,058 --> 01:06:37,019
<i>Come home!</i>

506
01:06:37,937 --> 01:06:40,231
<i>Come home!</i>

507
01:06:40,356 --> 01:06:41,315
No!

508
01:06:41,857 --> 01:06:44,443
No, no I won't!

509
01:06:44,902 --> 01:06:49,824
I'm sick of you! I hate you!
I despise you!

510
01:06:54,161 --> 01:06:56,247
Don't worry, Mother.

511
01:06:56,622 --> 01:06:58,999
Don't worry.

512
01:07:22,606 --> 01:07:24,233
Stop!

513
01:07:25,943 --> 01:07:27,194
Stay back!

514
01:07:27,319 --> 01:07:31,574
Alright, take it easy mister.
I don't want to hurt you.

515
01:07:31,949 --> 01:07:33,492
Get out of the way.

516
01:07:33,617 --> 01:07:35,578
Get out of the way!

517
01:07:35,703 --> 01:07:37,496
Do you understand?

518
01:07:37,621 --> 01:07:39,540
Give me your knife.

519
01:07:39,665 --> 01:07:42,084
Give me your knife!

520
01:07:48,549 --> 01:07:51,302
Back! Get back!

521
01:07:56,766 --> 01:07:59,727
I'm going to kill you bastard.

522
01:08:10,404 --> 01:08:12,323
I warned you.

523
01:08:12,448 --> 01:08:16,035
You had to leave me to be on your own.

524
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,662
Why didn't you listen to me?

525
01:08:18,788 --> 01:08:21,874
I'm coming to take you home.

526
01:08:21,957 --> 01:08:24,251
Don't leave the theater.

527
01:08:24,376 --> 01:08:27,463
You fool! Alice gave up so much for you!

528
01:08:27,588 --> 01:08:29,131
What's your problem?

529
01:08:32,885 --> 01:08:34,553
What's going on?

530
01:09:10,673 --> 01:09:13,008
Nobody leave your seats!

531
01:09:13,592 --> 01:09:16,095
Get up! Get up!

532
01:09:16,429 --> 01:09:19,306
Stay where you are! Don't move!

533
01:09:31,402 --> 01:09:33,446
You get down! Everyone down!

534
01:09:33,571 --> 01:09:36,031
Everyone down or I'll kill you!

535
01:09:41,579 --> 01:09:44,039
I know what I'm doing!

536
01:09:44,874 --> 01:09:46,667
There's a madman in there!

537
01:09:46,792 --> 01:09:50,588
Stay calm, police are on their way!

538
01:09:55,926 --> 01:09:58,637
Please don't let anything happen
to Patty.

539
01:09:59,472 --> 01:10:02,725
- Please, dear God.
- No one will harm your friend.

540
01:10:06,187 --> 01:10:09,023
We will find a way out.

541
01:10:14,862 --> 01:10:17,948
Stay away from the exits!
Stay away from the exits!

542
01:10:19,492 --> 01:10:21,535
Back, back!

543
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:23,537
I don't want to hurt anyone.

544
01:10:24,455 --> 01:10:26,165
The doors are locked!

545
01:10:33,631 --> 01:10:37,635
- She can stay here.
- Why don't you go inside?

546
01:10:38,844 --> 01:10:40,221
I'm right here.

547
01:10:41,347 --> 01:10:43,766
Take positions and stand by.

548
01:10:45,142 --> 01:10:50,856
- What have we got here, Captain?
- Looks bad.

549
01:10:56,237 --> 01:10:58,572
Don't move and nobody gets hurt!

550
01:11:00,699 --> 01:11:02,076
Stay in your seats!

551
01:11:02,201 --> 01:11:05,121
Stay calm! Get down!

552
01:11:05,621 --> 01:11:09,500
Stay calm! Get down!

553
01:11:09,625 --> 01:11:12,795
I told you! Stay away!

554
01:11:14,255 --> 01:11:16,173
There's no way out.

555
01:11:22,430 --> 01:11:25,015
Take this one to the 2nd ambulance.

556
01:11:26,684 --> 01:11:28,853
It's the third so far. Dead.

557
01:11:32,648 --> 01:11:34,358
I'm waiting for you Mother.

558
01:11:34,817 --> 01:11:36,735
<i>Then hurry.</i>

559
01:11:36,735 --> 01:11:38,571
We'll take it from here.

560
01:12:05,723 --> 01:12:07,266
Let's go!

561
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,940
- Unit One report.
- Pretty dark in there.

562
01:12:15,065 --> 01:12:18,611
Armed Caucasian male, 5 foot 7.
Hostage, female.

563
01:12:18,944 --> 01:12:22,239
They're in front of the screen.
Looks like he's got a .38.

564
01:12:22,364 --> 01:12:26,368
<i>Tell him there's no escape. He's
surrounded. And drop the girl.</i>

565
01:12:27,536 --> 01:12:29,497
<i>Keep the lights off to
protect the people.</i>

566
01:12:29,622 --> 01:12:33,584
<i>Establish a dialog with the guy.
Test his reactions.</i>

567
01:12:33,959 --> 01:12:36,670
<i>...the L.A.P.D.</i>

568
01:12:38,631 --> 01:12:40,341
<i>...got you surrounded.</i>

569
01:12:40,466 --> 01:12:42,551
<i>There's no way out.</i>

570
01:12:43,302 --> 01:12:45,888
<i>Let the girl go!</i>

571
01:12:46,639 --> 01:12:49,767
<i>Put your hands in the
air and don't move!</i>

572
01:12:49,892 --> 01:12:52,394
No! I can't leave.

573
01:12:52,686 --> 01:12:55,856
Not until Mother comes to get me.

574
01:12:58,692 --> 01:13:00,402
A real weirdo.

575
01:13:00,528 --> 01:13:04,782
<i>In my opinion, there is no way we can
establish a dialog with this guy.</i>

576
01:13:05,157 --> 01:13:07,076
I think I'm going to pass out.

577
01:13:08,077 --> 01:13:10,996
Try and breathe as evenly as possible.

578
01:13:11,455 --> 01:13:14,959
I'm not going to drop the gun!
Just leave me alone!

579
01:13:15,084 --> 01:13:19,588
Leave me alone! I'll kill her!
I don't want to hurt anyone!

580
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:21,674
I have to stay here.

581
01:13:21,799 --> 01:13:23,926
She's coming to take me home!

582
01:13:24,051 --> 01:13:25,803
Leave me alone!

583
01:13:26,387 --> 01:13:28,681
Mother, please take me back.

584
01:13:28,973 --> 01:13:31,225
I want to go home!

585
01:13:32,268 --> 01:13:34,854
<i>Don't say anything else to him.
He may kill the girl.</i>

586
01:13:34,979 --> 01:13:37,648
<i>Wait for the right moment.
Don't take any chances.</i>

587
01:13:37,773 --> 01:13:42,027
<i>Wait a few seconds, and if he doesn't
drop the girl, we'll turn on the lights.</i>

588
01:13:42,361 --> 01:13:43,946
<i>Got that?</i>

589
01:13:47,241 --> 01:13:49,869
Yes, Mother. I'm waiting for you.

590
01:13:49,994 --> 01:13:51,620
I'll be good.

591
01:13:52,079 --> 01:13:56,125
Captain, I think we should stop the
movie. He's talking to the screen.

592
01:13:56,417 --> 01:13:58,627
<i>Have you got a clear shot?</i>

593
01:13:59,545 --> 01:14:01,338
No, not yet.

594
01:14:01,464 --> 01:14:03,132
The girl's too close to him.

595
01:14:03,257 --> 01:14:05,551
The light! The light!

596
01:14:08,387 --> 01:14:10,181
I see the light!

597
01:14:11,056 --> 01:14:13,017
I see it's power!

598
01:14:19,023 --> 01:14:20,608
I'll be a...

599
01:14:20,733 --> 01:14:22,526
good boy.

600
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:26,197
I won't hurt anyone anymore.

601
01:14:32,328 --> 01:14:35,456
- I'm sorry I didn't believe you at first.
- It's okay.

602
01:14:36,123 --> 01:14:39,627
It's gonna be okay. She'll be alright.

603
01:14:41,128 --> 01:14:42,671
Don't do it!

604
01:14:45,633 --> 01:14:49,261
You bastard!
You took my mother away from me!

605
01:14:53,891 --> 01:14:55,810
Wait a minute - he dropped the girl.

606
01:14:55,935 --> 01:14:59,230
Take him out clean. All units stand by.

607
01:15:25,881 --> 01:15:28,134
What are you looking at?

608
01:15:28,259 --> 01:15:30,886
I want your eyes too!

609
01:15:31,011 --> 01:15:32,972
Like all the others!

610
01:15:38,519 --> 01:15:41,605
- He's in there. He's got a girl.
- Don't worry. He's dead.

611
01:15:54,869 --> 01:15:58,456
They got the killer. Your friend's
alright. She'll be out in a minute.

612
01:15:58,456 --> 01:16:01,834
You certainly took
your time to get here.

613
01:16:01,959 --> 01:16:04,670
We got here as fast as we could.

614
01:16:15,681 --> 01:16:19,143
Roll over, calm down.

615
01:17:04,021 --> 01:17:05,439
Patty!

616
01:17:07,650 --> 01:17:08,818
Patty!

617
01:17:34,677 --> 01:17:38,722
I was so scared I couldn't see you!
I'm sorry I didn't believe you!

618
01:17:38,848 --> 01:17:42,768
- Did he hurt you?
- I was really...

619
01:17:42,893 --> 01:17:45,396
It must have been terrible for you!

620
01:17:58,409 --> 01:18:01,912
I'm with you now, Patty.
Don't worry, I won't leave.

621
01:18:02,037 --> 01:18:04,957
I promise I won't leave you.

622
01:18:17,303 --> 01:18:21,849
She thought the scalpel was in her eye,
but it was all in her imagination.

623
01:18:21,974 --> 01:18:26,312
In a couple of days, she'll be completely
recovered. It was quite a shock.

624
01:18:26,645 --> 01:18:29,064
I think she'd be better
off staying here.

625
01:18:29,190 --> 01:18:34,403
It was all in her imagination,
but for her it was quite real.

626
01:18:34,987 --> 01:18:37,239
You don't have to worry any longer.

627
01:18:37,364 --> 01:18:41,077
It's best we leave her alone now,
I don't want her excited.

628
01:18:41,202 --> 01:18:44,163
Don't worry. Your daughter will be fine.

629
01:18:48,793 --> 01:18:50,878
Your not going to leave me alone?

630
01:18:51,003 --> 01:18:53,214
She's had enough excitement for today.

631
01:18:53,339 --> 01:18:58,094
Don't worry, but I have to go now.
The doctor wants you to get some rest.

632
01:18:59,011 --> 01:18:59,411
Stay.

633
01:18:59,437 --> 01:19:01,038
I'll be back first thing
tomorrow morning.

634
01:19:01,138 --> 01:19:02,848
Come on now. Time to go.

635
01:19:04,558 --> 01:19:06,185
Come back tomorrow.

636
01:19:06,519 --> 01:19:09,688
- You have to leave now.
- I have to leave, Patty.

637
01:19:09,814 --> 01:19:13,109
Are you sure I can't stay? We won't
talk or anything.

638
01:19:13,234 --> 01:19:15,486
- I'll just lay on the couch.
- Your friend needs to sleep.

639
01:19:15,611 --> 01:19:20,074
With you here, she'll just start
remembering what happened.

640
01:19:45,558 --> 01:19:48,602
- See you tomorrow.
- Goodbye, Doctor.

641
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:53,816
The girl in Room 22. If she wakes up,
give her this tranquilizer.

642
01:19:54,608 --> 01:19:56,318
See you tomorrow.

643
01:20:29,351 --> 01:20:32,605
Like the doctor said, it's all in
your imagination.

644
01:20:32,730 --> 01:20:35,232
I really don't exist.
