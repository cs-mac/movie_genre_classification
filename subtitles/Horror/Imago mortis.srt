1
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,153
And people looked like they were
interested in what I was saying...

2
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,515
Hi, Orfeo.

3
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,833
- Happy New Year...
- Hey, Bruno! It's been a while!

4
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,388
- How are you?
- Fine. How did you spend Christmas?

5
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,835
Working all night, as usual.

6
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,515
You call this life?
Santa left a present for you.

7
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,828
Really?

8
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,909
Hey...

9
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,719
Absinth!

10
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,629
Thanks, Bruno. If I had any power
in this film school I'd give you...

11
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,797
-...the highest grades in every discipline.
- I know.

12
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,993
It's for her.

13
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,199
Do it, Orfeo...

14
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,880
The camera you see here,
my dear students...

15
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,959
...is the same one with which
your principal, Gustav Olinsky...

16
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,036
...fiilmed every one of his movies.

17
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,915
Behind this hatch...

18
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,478
...the history of cinema was imprinted...

19
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,638
...with a photochemical process.

20
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,750
- Hi! - How are you? - Fine.

21
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,395
- Hi... Aki! - Yo, Richard, how are you?
- How was your Christmas, Matteo?

22
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,115
It was like every holiday:
I ate a lot and drank too much.

23
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,231
- Hi, Aki!
- Here you are, Bruno!

24
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,913
- Didn't see you in class.
- Yeah, we just arrived.

25
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,349
- The trip was horrible.
- Did you come with Ozu?

26
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,273
- Yeah, he'll be here soon. He wanted
to call home before, you know...

27
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,799
- Ciao.
- Scusa.

28
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,394
- Oh... - Yo! - Yo...

29
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,636
Calavera...

30
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,919
- How are you? - Fine, and you?
- Me too.

31
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,030
- Any news about your grandmother?
- Mh... well... you know, she...

32
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,549
- I hope your aim improves.
- Hi.

33
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,830
- Leilou, forgive me for before.
- Don't worry.

34
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,996
- But now I'm stealing her away from you for a while.
- Of course.

35
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,230
- Fine with you? - Okay, see you later.
- Okay.

36
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,039
Excuse me, Mr. Olinsky.
I wanted to talk with you about something.

37
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,113
Something regarding the fiilm archive.

38
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,792
- So tell me, what's the problem?
- You see, I'm having an hard time making ends meet.

39
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,795
And I was thinking that if started
working in the archive again...

40
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,997
...I'd be able to pay...
at least a fraction of the college funds.

41
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,718
You're the student that
lost his family in an accident...

42
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,153
...a while ago, right?

43
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,555
- Yes. - Countess Orsini became very
worried about you, since that happened.

44
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,359
- She cares about you a lot.
- Yeah.

45
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,590
Well then, welcome back
to the archive, Marquez!

46
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,792
Thanks, professor Caligari.

47
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,239
Olinsky.

48
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,350
Silence, please. Thanks.

49
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,159
A lot of you dream of becoming a director.

50
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,236
The different roles will be decided with a test...

51
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,276
...I'm about to propose to you all.

52
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,714
In the next 10 days you'll have to submit...

53
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,598
...a photographic excercise...

54
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,310
...which will allow our dear teachers
to evaluate your dedication,...

55
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,996
...your sensibility, your technique
and your personal style.

56
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,230
So, a single photo for each theme...

57
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,476
...which will be submitted with a fake name...

58
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,275
...and which will be evaluated by the faculty.

59
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,273
Only I will know the authors' names.

60
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,590
How much time do we have for each photo?

61
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,389
Since its Monday, you'll have
to submit it Wednesday morning.

62
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,234
Time.

63
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,476
- Hello, Calavera. How's it going?
- Hey...

64
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,554
- Fine. - How have your holidays been?
- Hm, fine.

65
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,398
- Did you miss me?
- I'd say so!

66
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,559
Uhm... Elena is throwing a small
party for her birthday this evening.

67
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,959
Really?

68
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,517
No teachers, only a few friends.

69
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,556
- Yes, but... I dont think I'll come.
- Why not?

70
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,231
- I've got to work at the archive.
- Can't you start tomorrow?

71
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,789
- We'll all be there, it'll be fun.
- Yeah...

72
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,273
- Okay.
- Okay.

73
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,396
I'll tell Elena you won't be there.

74
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,949
Okay.

75
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,513
Here you go, youngin'.

76
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,508
Thanks.

77
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,995
Countess Orsini, Professor Olinsky told me that...

78
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,558
...you worried about me because
of the accident involving my family.

79
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,839
Well, I wanted to thank you.

80
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,435
It's something that saddened me a lot.

81
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,438
Didnt you get the data from Astolfi?

82
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,160
- No, I'm going now. - Ah.

83
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,159
- Well, let's hope that old fart
won't give you any problems.

84
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,118
Its a real pleasure to have you back in the archive, you know?

85
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,429
Thanks.

86
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,039
Mister Astolfi?

87
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,354
Mister Astolfi? It's Bruno Marquez.

88
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,839
I'm the student in charge with the archive.

89
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,869
I don't want to annoy you,
but I have to get all the data you have.

90
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,912
Bruno Marquez...

91
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,716
You look more dead than alive.

92
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,670
- How's the food in the mess hall?
- Well... it's not bad.

93
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,191
Kinda disgusting, eh?

94
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,274
- You can come back on friday. Okay?
- Okay.

95
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,035
Thank you.

96
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:35,197
Poor Astolfi... since his son died
he's not the same anymore.

97
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,632
Drink it. It'll make all your ghosts go away.

98
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,435
Ah!

99
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,712
Orfeo, is that true that Caligari
fiilmed all his movies...

100
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,679
...with this camera?
- Yes, that's right.

101
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,829
All his creativity was imprinted here.

102
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,996
Don't keep us on our toes, Lucia.
Can we see it now?

103
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:47,432
Of course, Gusta, We tought
a little wait would have...

104
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,593
...whetted your appetite.
Right, Athanasius?

105
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,669
May I?

106
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:09,916
The very first edition of Kircher's
"Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae"!

107
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,878
- It's wonderful... - Incredible!
- Wonderful, Lucia!

108
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,875
What's up?

109
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,192
- Did you see it, too?
- What are you talking about?

110
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,391
There was a boy near the shelves,
pointing at something!

111
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,549
I'm the only one here.

112
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,553
I thought you'd like to see me
and I didn't go to the party.

113
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,552
Okay, it's just that you
scared me. Sorry.

114
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,232
- Did you drink something?
- Absinthe.

115
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,069
I bought a bottle for Orfeo
and we drank some of it.

116
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,395
- That explains your visions.
- Yeah.

117
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,638
Can we get out of here... please?

118
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,280
Yessir, Captain Calavera!

119
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,559
I don't get why you always
have to call me Calavera!

120
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,791
Your skin is so pale...
Calaveras are marzipan skulls...

121
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,950
...that the kids eat in Mexico City...

122
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,635
...during the "Day of the Dead".
I'm making you a compliment!

123
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,918
- Elena.
- Hi! We missed you yesterday night.

124
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,788
Yeah, I'm sorry.
They told you the reason, right?

125
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,396
- Sure, don't worry.
- Here. I got... I got something for you.

126
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,356
- Oh thanks, you didn't have to.
It's wonderful! - Yeah...

127
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,313
I see you're aware of my taste
for the macabre.

128
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,198
Well, I know we like the same things.

129
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:11,479
- You know, we could work together...
Iike writing a script, or... - Yeah!

130
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,790
- Yeah?
- Interesting.

131
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:19,034
- Oh, you think so? Thanks... er... bye.
- See you soon.

132
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,237
And this last one is from
some guy named "Calavera".

133
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,033
I wanted you to know this class level...

134
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,236
...and what your classmates have submitted.

135
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,472
Now, I think this is a way to get
better for the next theme.

136
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,199
Death.

137
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,950
- What happened?
- Arianna, I saw him again. - Who?

138
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:27,274
The boy from the archive. In the woods...
I went to take pictures of animals...

139
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,278
...and he was there. - Are you sure?
- I swear! I saw him!

140
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,352
- You have to believe me!
- I'll start to eat.

141
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,153
Okay, I'm coming.

142
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,393
Listen, come to my room after you're
done with the archives...

143
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,109
...so we can speak a bit. Okay?
- Okay. Later.

144
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,279
Calaverita? She's not there.

145
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,432
- How do you know about Calavera?
- It's not like a big secret.

146
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:34,193
- Did she tell you where she was headed?
- She's in the dark room together with June and Richard.

147
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,069
This afternoon she was struck by inspiration...

148
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,310
...while you were working in the archive.

149
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,999
Hey, your photo was really fantastic.

150
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,834
Now we'll open up the back of this Bolex...

151
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,155
...and I'll show you the various mechanisms.

152
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,676
As you can see, its design
is simple and compact...

153
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,957
It's easy to handle and to shoot,
just like an AK-47.

154
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,516
- Now let's open it...

155
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,358
...so I'll show you all
the various functions.

156
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,759
The incredible ease of use makes this camera
really useful to shoot documentaries...

157
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,990
"At two o'clock in my room!"

158
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:18,312
You hold it with your hands, like this.
Please everybody, pay attention.

159
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,155
May I?

160
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:31,476
You can come, but don't even
breath until I say so.

161
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,157
Ah! Got it.

162
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,033
Do you recognize this cave?

163
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,471
Yes. They call it "Well of Death".

164
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,633
It's an hour's walk from the school.
In the woods, behind Mrs. Orsini's house.

165
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,475
- Thank you.
- Bruno!

166
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,192
- If you want to bring a girl there,
I know loads of better places.

167
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,997
Do me a favour. Come with me to that cave.

168
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,755
- Bruno, I'm REALLY trying to believe you, but...
- Please, you have to come with me.

169
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,635
To see if there really is something there...

170
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,988
...and it's not just me going crazy.
Listen: I promise you...

171
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,030
...that if we go there and find nothing,
I won't touch the subject anymore. Okay?

172
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,916
Why can't you go alone?

173
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,318
Because I trust you...

174
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,715
...and I'm scared.

175
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,438
He pointed at something in this direction.

176
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,235
Wait!

177
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,592
- He was there.
- Where? - Here!

178
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,074
What is that?

179
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,196
It looks like some kind of helmet.

180
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,953
- Damn...

181
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,591
We're done for today.

182
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,029
Fear.

183
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,110
- Since the week is about to end,
you'll have one more day...

184
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,839
...to take your picture.

185
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,519
Please, I would like to talk
with the student nicknamed "Calavera".

186
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,949
We both know you found
the object, Mister Marquez...

187
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,600
...but you got something
that belongs to this school!

188
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,478
...and I think its absurd that
you hid it under your bed!

189
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,477
- It's not there anymore, professor.
- What?!

190
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,870
I don't know... somebody took it.

191
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,349
Those tools are extremely important!

192
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,036
- Important for what, professor?
- This is none of your business!

193
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,556
Find the thanatoscope, Mister Marquez,
or you will be thrown out of this college.

194
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,916
Do you have any idea on who stole it?

195
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,073
No, I don't.

196
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,149
But I'm going to be honest with you:
I'm in big trouble.

197
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:21,153
Caligari told me that if I
don't find it, he'll kick me out.

198
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,831
- Tell me, did you have other visions today?
- No.

199
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,199
- But, did you see? That stuff about
the cave was true. - Yes, it was true...

200
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,351
I gotta go. I have to get some
old movies at Astolfi's place.

201
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,953
Astolfi?

202
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,635
And Caligari... and Countess Orsini...

203
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,190
I see you like hanging with all
the school's freaks, Calavera...

204
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,272
Yeah, right... I'm Calavera after all.

205
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,317
- The thanatoscope is back with us.
- What, the thanatoscope?

206
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:09,075
"With us"? Wasn't it...
Does Ermete know about it?

207
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,793
So, where is it?

208
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,838
One of our students accidentally found it.

209
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,918
But I think he wanted to steal it.

210
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,949
- Gustav, talk to Ermete about it!
- This is really preposterous!

211
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,039
Mister Astolfi?

212
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,156
Mister Astolfi? It's Bruno Marquez.

213
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,797
I came to get the data, as we agreed.

214
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,269
Hello.

215
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,279
I never agreed to anything with anyone.

216
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,952
Expecially not with the
worst student of our school.

217
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,596
- You're pulling my leg, right?
- But of course I'm just kidding.

218
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,791
Come inside, my boy.

219
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,429
Here.

220
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,239
Can you take a look to this photo, please?

221
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,399
Mister Ermete?

222
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,833
Mister Astolfi?

223
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,233
Mister Ermete?

224
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,879
Where did you get it?

225
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,552
It's a picture of a tool I found the other day...

226
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,039
...in the "Well of Death".

227
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,429
The Well of Death... I see...

228
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,473
- Where is it now?
- I don't know.

229
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,158
- Somebody stole it from my room.
- When? - This morning.

230
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,472
- Darn...
- Mister Olinsky called it...

231
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,757
- "Thanascope".
- Thanatoscope! Did Olinksy see it?

232
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,788
Yes... or no... I can't remember now. You see, I...

233
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:14,668
- You have 10 seconds to get out of here.
- What? - 9.

234
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,155
- But...
- 8.

235
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,708
- What did I say? - 7.
- Can you at least give me back... - 6.

236
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,438
- Give me back my photo.
- Scram!

237
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,555
You woke up early!

238
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,551
Hi. Morning, Leilou.

239
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,595
What's up?

240
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,799
Did you use a butchered lamb... for your photo?

241
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,553
- Me?! - Yeah.
- A lamb? - Yeah.

242
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,315
As far as I know, only two people
like dead animals here.

243
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,072
You and Aki.

244
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,793
Forget it.

245
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,912
- Hi...
- Calavera!

246
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,992
Listen, I've got to tell somebody
what's happening to me...

247
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,595
...or else I'll go crazy.
Can you come to the library with me?

248
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,354
Believe me, Arianna. There's too
much strange stuff happening!

249
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:51,038
First the vision, then the cave.
And the chest, the theft, the lamb!

250
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,919
- Why are we in the library?
- Because now I'm sure.

251
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,388
If we search together, I'm sure we
can find out what a thanatoscope is.

252
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,232
- A what?
- A thanatoscope.

253
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,796
That lantern-thing we found.
I think Caligari knew about it.

254
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,917
Astolfi is trying to rebuild it. So...

255
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,355
Read.

256
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,596
"It's a mock-up, done with ancient drawings...

257
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,797
...of tools created by Girolamo Fumagalli...

258
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:26,476
...by the end of the XVII century,
which seems to have magical features."

259
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,632
"For many, the thanatoscope was
the first step in the direction...

260
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:33,429
...that brought, centuries after,
the invention of photography."

261
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,793
- It's over?
- It's over.

262
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,395
Look!

263
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,914
- Orsini! Like the Countess!
- The school's owner? - Yeah!

264
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,153
When we printed that book...

265
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:02,556
...I didn't know what a thanatoscope
was at all. Neither did I know its origin...

266
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,588
...or what it was for. I only knew it existed...

267
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:10,468
...so I decided to put it in the book,
but only as random trivia.

268
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,955
Some time after I found some references...

269
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,919
...in an ancient manuscript
and realizing its importance...

270
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,959
...i decided to publish a book
focused on the tanathoscope itself.

271
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:26,592
On its dark powers and naturally
on its inventor, Girolamo Fumagalli.

272
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,431
During my research I stumbled
onto the original thanatoscope...

273
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:34,672
...built by Fumagalli itself and used
in a German expressionist movie...

274
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,955
...about his life, which was never completed.

275
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,351
I found out that the objects from
the movie set were all auctioned...

276
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,671
...by UFA studios itself.

277
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,558
So I sent Gustav Olinsky to buy them all.

278
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,949
Bundled with the thanatoscope
and all the other instruments...

279
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,591
...there also was the script of that movie
which was cancelled so abruptly.

280
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,075
Well, Olinsky went mad about that script...

281
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,068
...so I decided to produce the movie.

282
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,111
I had Fumagalli's entire lab rebuilt
from the ground up.

283
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:11,557
Olinsky was the director and
Astolfi the cinematographer.

284
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:19,391
Fumagalli was a Jesuit. He had been
a disciple of Athanasius Kircher...

285
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,835
...a man who lived in the 17th Century...

286
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,674
...who was held in great reverence
among alchemists.

287
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,395
Fumagalli was a true genius.
He discovered that in the human eye...

288
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,278
...images are quickly imprinted on the retina...

289
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,635
...and therefore they could be captured.

290
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,915
Snapshots from a man's life can be preserved...

291
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,958
...and survive death and decay.

292
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:43,231
The "tool" used to capture the
pictures was a human being...

293
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,392
...who was forced to stare at a composition.

294
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:51,076
Istant death was caused
by rupturing the occipital bone.

295
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,916
Carpem mortis aspectum...

296
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,079
...per oculos tuos!

297
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:11,878
Carpem mortis aspectum per oculos tuos!

298
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,430
"I'll capture death through your eyes."

299
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:21,548
To capture the pictures you had
to extract the eyeballs...

300
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,428
...and extract the contents of the
retina with a peculiar instrument.

301
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,757
That's what the thanatoscope did:

302
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,479
It projected the pictures
imprinted on a retina...

303
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,990
...on a thin glass sheet
which was imbued...

304
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,514
...with a photosensitive liquid.

305
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,195
That way you were able to keep the
pictures forever, through all times.

306
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:46,471
Fumagalli called this
procedure "Thanatography".

307
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,519
However, while he was going wild
with all his experiments, he was captured,...

308
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,439
...tried and sentenced to death.

309
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,875
The shooting of our movie was halted too,
because of a death...

310
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,916
...caused by the thanatoscope.

311
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:18,195
Astolfi's son, Sebastiano,
was Olinsky's assistant...

312
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:22,068
...and his girlfriend acted
as the experiment's guinea pig.

313
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,278
To shoot a scene, Sebastiano
put the killing mechanism...

314
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,752
...right on the girl's head,
sure that the safety lock was on.

315
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,593
Howerver, inexplainably, during the shooting...

316
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,588
...the mechanism suddenly sprung up,
killing the girl istantly.

317
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,277
That night Sebastiano took the thanatoscope...

318
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,476
...and hid it along with everything else...

319
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,758
...and committed suicide, by jumping
out the window on the last floor.

320
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,038
Since then Astolfi,
unable to cope with the pain...

321
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:56,955
...has been living like a hermit
in the attic where his son died.

322
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:03,110
Er... would it be possible to take
a look at all the data about that movie?

323
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:06,835
Everything that was shot
is kept in our archive.

324
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,229
Oh...

325
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,713
It can't be...

326
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,589
It's him...

327
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,756
He's trying to tell me something.

328
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,392
He wants to tell me something.

329
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,236
Sorry, I should've believed you.

330
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,149
Calavera...

331
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,910
It's Sunday!
Why don't you try to relax a bit?

332
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,513
Let's get back to sleep.

333
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,958
Yeah...

334
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,273
Astolfi is trying to
rebuild the thanatoscope...

335
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,112
I saw it with my own eyes!

336
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,436
- I saw the copy!
- So what?

337
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:44,230
Well, I think he has the original...
I think that...

338
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,348
-...the one who stole it from
my room gave it to him. - So?

339
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,991
So it might be used again!
We have to stop it!

340
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,195
- Where are you going now?
- Follow me.

341
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,595
- Good morning, Orfeo.
- Bruno Marquez!

342
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:18,478
- Are we bothering you?
- No, no, come in!

343
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:23,356
Well, I know that both you and
Ms. Niccolodi have the keys to all the rooms.

344
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,592
- Hm? - I need the Astolfi one.
Can you give it to me?

345
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:34,753
- Hm...
- Well... I tought that you could...

346
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,468
- Well, you know.
- Now... I... can't.

347
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,637
Believe me, Orfeo.
It's really important to me.

348
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,793
I'm really sorry, but I can't do that.

349
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,430
But if by chance somebody entered here...

350
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,988
...and took the third key in the first row...

351
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,629
Third key... first row...

352
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,789
I wonder... what would happen.

353
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,234
- Hey! -Hello!
- How's it going, pal? - Fine.

354
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:10,239
- Did you meet Arianna?
- Yes, at the entrance with Leilou.

355
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:14,035
- Do you have your picture for tomorrow?
- Yes, it's ready, I just developed it.

356
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:16,953
- Fantastic. See you tomorrow then.
- Good Night! - Bye!

357
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,792
Orfeo! Orfeo!

358
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,434
Orfeo!

359
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,475
In this photo we can see a certain use,...

360
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:23,552
...even if it's not all that well done,
of field depth.

361
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,593
Mr. Marquez!

362
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,474
What does this photo represent for you?!

363
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:39,154
Well... I tried to describe fear...

364
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:44,276
...using everything I had at hand, professor.

365
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:58,918
Destiny!

366
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,516
Ms. Niccolodi, do you know where Orfeo is?

367
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,999
He went to the city.
He had to buy some replacements.

368
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:34,196
- Do you know when will he come back?
- That's up to him, Marquez.

369
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:37,272
You know Orfeo well.
It's raining a lot.

370
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:42,715
The road must be blocked. Maybe he's going
to sleep at his brother's place.

371
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,348
Countess Orsini!

372
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,679
- What's the matter, Marquez?!
- They killed him!

373
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,631
Orfeo is dead! They used him
for... a thanatography!

374
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,632
Now calm down! You're panicking.

375
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,355
Astolfi wants to re-enact
the rituals... and I'm sure....

376
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,069
...that crazy Caligari is lending him a hand.
- Caligari?

377
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:38,391
- Professor Olinsky, Countess!
- Caligari?

378
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:43,318
Should I take it as a compliment,
Mr. Marquez?

379
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:47,190
This is the end of your job at the archive!
Another misstep...

380
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:50,113
...and I'll send you back to your
grandma's home immediatly!

381
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,709
Come on, hand me the keys.

382
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,673
Give me back the archive keys, Mr. Marquez!

383
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,875
It's too bad I'll have to inform
your classmates...

384
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:04,793
...about the disturbing
mental state you're in.

385
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,479
Marquez!

386
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,115
Elena...

387
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:21,036
...please tell Ms. Niccolodi...

388
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:24,351
...to gather all the students
in the Main Hall in an hour.

389
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,477
- Something happened?
- No. Not yet.

390
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,755
Ermete? It's me, Gustav.

391
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:48,639
What do you want?

392
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,835
Can you let us in for a moment?

393
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,310
We're looking for something. Can we?

394
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,877
It's just a few minutes.

395
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,714
May I ask you what you
were doing, Ermete?

396
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:11,590
I was rearranging stuff. You know,
I collected too much crap over the years.

397
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,232
Mr. Marquez...

398
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,990
You all know this is a small community...

399
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:50,076
...Iike a big family. The reason why
I gathered you all here today...

400
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,628
...is to inform you of a rather grave matter...

401
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:56,235
...which unfortunately involves
one of your classmates...

402
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,639
Mr. Marquez.

403
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:01,429
Every one of you knows about
the tragic death of his parents...

404
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,988
...which occurred some months
ago because of an accident.

405
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:08,398
So, I ask everyone in this class
to be sympathetic to him...

406
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,439
...because I'm sure every one of you
understands his fragile state of mind.

407
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:14,718
Thanks for your attention.

408
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,195
Ari...

409
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:37,835
- What happened?
- Today I went to see Countess Orsini...

410
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:43,188
...and I told her... that Astolfi
was trying to repeat the experiment.

411
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:45,755
And I moronically accused Caligari...

412
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,555
...to be... his accomplice...

413
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:51,913
...and... to have killed Orfeo.

414
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:58,678
-But Caligari was there and he heard everything.
- Bruno...

415
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,671
I'm not... I don't have any
mental illness, believe me.

416
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:11,757
And then... he tried to make me look
like a joke... in front of everybody.

417
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:15,635
I'm not confused...
due to my family's passing.

418
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,519
Yeah, he played dirty.

419
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:22,439
And... what are the others saying?

420
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,991
You can guess it...

421
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:29,795
- Elena wants to know if there's a way to help you.
- Of course.

422
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,678
She's so kind.

423
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:35,109
Leilou noticed you act strangely...

424
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,272
...but you always act strangely, so...

425
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,990
- What about Arianna?
- Arianna... is so worried about you...

426
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,316
I really missed you a lot.

427
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:53,514
- We only met yesterday.
- No...

428
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:57,637
For me it was... a lot longer ago.

429
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,432
Do you still have the key to Astolfi's room?

430
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,073
What key?

431
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,115
Bruno!

432
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:57,715
Bruno!

433
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,119
Bruno!

434
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,029
Bruno!

435
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,119
What happened to you?

436
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:08,068
I don't know.

437
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:18,476
I was... I was running
and... somebody hit me.

438
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:25,839
- Did you go get the key?
- Elena... - What?!

439
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:29,749
- They killed Elena... - Listen...
-...and somebody else...

440
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:34,871
- In the theater!
- Stop! Bruno! Bruno!

441
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:54,398
What are you doing Bruno?!
We're working here!

442
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:58,151
You still don't know
what the red light means?

443
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,590
Oh, sorry, Calavera...

444
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,833
Caligari asked us to go soft on you...

445
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:09,593
- He told us of your problems.
- Stop it, Lou.

446
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:11,909
Let's go.

447
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,474
Let's go.

448
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,272
So, you threw the key away...

449
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:27,397
...then you waited for me to be
asleep to go get it back?

450
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:30,358
- No, it didn't go this way!
- If you think that by acting this way...

451
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,317
...you can earn my trust,
you're dead wrong.

452
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:38,479
- No... Iisten to me...
- Bruno Marquez...

453
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:46,111
You have to swallow one of these
after breakfast and another after dinner...

454
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,634
It's for your mental health.

455
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,429
Try to sleep more at night.

456
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,438
I have a class right now.

457
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:57,991
You wanna clean yourself up a little or would
you rather stay in your room to see dead people?

458
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:01,872
I think I'll take a shower
and change my clothes.

459
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:03,791
Don't forget the pills.

460
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:10,228
Bruno, it hurts me to see you
in this state. You have to recover.

461
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,599
Okay.

462
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,553
You wouldn't believe everything
Caligari said, right?

463
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:30,191
No, of course not.
Don't worry. Are you okay?

464
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:33,477
Yeah, I'm alright. Just a bit tired.

465
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:38,235
- Did you guys meet Elena today?
- No, we don't have the same classes.

466
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:43,556
Did you notice if there was somebody
else missing this morning?

467
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:50,395
- Ah... Matteo!
- Yeah, Gunter was missing too.

468
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:54,190
- Why? Did something happen?
- No, nothing.

469
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:04,919
Gunter?

470
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,469
Gunter?

471
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:11,400
- Hi...
- Bruno, what do you want?! - I'm sorry...

472
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:16,429
It's just that... I didn't see
you in class and I wanted to know...

473
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,958
-...if you're alrlight.
- Oh... well I've got the flu.

474
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:22,838
- Take care, okay?
- Okay, thanks.

475
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,355
Matteo?

476
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:32,669
Matteo?

477
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:36,992
The student Matteo Danese has
been granted a permission...

478
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:41,153
...to absent himself from lessons
to take a picture of the old factory.

479
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,309
Who signed it?

480
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:46,789
Dr. Elena Montenegro. Oh, look!

481
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,916
It says she's accompanying him.

482
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:25,234
- Hey, chill out, man...
- Damn...

483
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,389
Oh, I forgot, you're the one that...

484
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:30,714
Sorry.

485
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:34,112
- How are you, crazy-boy?
- I'm fine.

486
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,269
You almost gave me a heart attack.

487
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:38,873
Are you going back to your room?

488
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,313
Yeah.

489
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,951
I'm going to the studio.
I'm bringing these little wonders to Aki.

490
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:50,312
- Cool stuff, uh?
- She'll like them a lot.

491
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,034
This school is unluckily overrun by bugs.

492
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:57,596
- Aki loves it, though.
- Well, see ya.

493
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,113
Get some rest.

494
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:02,592
See you tomorrow.

495
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:45,996
Wow... they're the biggest ones
I've ever seen here at school.

496
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:50,398
Richard has been nice to you.
I thought he only cared about Elena.

497
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,313
Ozu...

498
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:17,154
Aki...

499
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:19,279
Ozu...

500
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,633
The nickname of this author is Murnau.

501
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:11,312
- Ah!
- Calavera...

502
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:14,795
The boy who has issues...

503
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,355
Hey...

504
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:31,393
- You know where Ozu and Aki are?
- They must be sleeping as usual.

505
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,631
- They're always late.

506
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:40,912
- With today's theme
the exercise is complete.

507
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,470
The evaluation criteria will be
on both artistic and technical sides.

508
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:48,389
The teachers will rate them and,
depending on this, every one of you...

509
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:52,075
...will get a role in the
shooting of the shorts.

510
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,432
Truth.

511
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:48,471
What's happening, Mr. Astolfi?

512
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:55,519
Every last imprisoned soul
will be set free.

513
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:58,629
They will finally rest in peace.

514
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:01,711
What are you talking about?

515
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,628
A perfect thanatography...

516
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:10,590
They will be freed by creating
a perfect thanatography.

517
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:14,156
- What's this?
- This will save Sebastiano.

518
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:16,714
But Sebastiano is dead, Mr. Astolfi!

519
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:22,830
Death is just a transition.
It's the price we have to pay for our sins.

520
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:28,108
It's also the only way to obtain...

521
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:30,990
...a perfect thanatography...

522
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:36,154
...a picture which freezes
the exact moment of death...

523
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,950
...the one in which you suddenly realize...

524
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:42,038
...your unavoidable end.

525
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:46,669
To obtain it you need two victims...

526
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:52,118
...to stare at each other in the eyes
in the exact moment of death.

527
01:17:53,480 --> 01:18:00,397
The thanatoscope allowed Fumagalli
to continue his cursed experiments...

528
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:03,916
...after his death, through
the hands of others...

529
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:07,396
It's like his spirit possessed them...

530
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:12,549
...to complete the work
he started four centuries ago.

531
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:19,478
- This... this is ridicolous!
- Not if Satan will get what he deserves...

532
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:25,517
Everything will come to an end and,
freed from the curse, every one of them...

533
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:31,233
...will overcome death and
be free for all eternity.

534
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:38,471
- Where is Orfeo?
- Only by dying can someone be reborn.

535
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:49,313
You killed him.

536
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:57,679
- Where do you think you're going now?
- To the studio, to end this...

537
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,318
...once and for all.

538
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:27,675
Arianna! Arianna, it's all true!
Astolfi did it!

539
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,470
No, Arianna... no!

540
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:23,229
Arianna!

541
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,912
Arianna! Calm down.

542
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:29,392
I'm with you now! Don't be scared!
Calm down! You don't have to...

543
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,313
Leilou? What do you want to do?

544
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,673
- What are you doing?
- Don't worry.

545
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:40,918
No, no, please.
Did you go crazy?

546
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:42,115
Stop it!

547
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:47,148
Stop it, Leilou.

548
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,999
- It's a bad joke...
- Shh!

549
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:53,432
Keep your eyes like that, okay?
You won't feel pain, Calavera.

550
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:55,033
I promise.

551
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:57,915
Why do you want to do this
horrible thing to us?

552
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,915
Your contribution will be invaluable.

553
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:03,952
Thanks to you,
my short will be fantastic!

554
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:07,277
And when I'll show professor
Olinsky what I have done...

555
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:09,551
...the director's chair will be mine.

556
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:14,716
He was so kind to me when he found out...

557
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:17,872
...I was the one to get the
device from your room...

558
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:24,078
He didn't even scold me.
Instead, he showed me how to use it.

559
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,677
Isn't it wonderful, Bruno?

560
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:33,595
He told me that if I was able to include...

561
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:37,434
...a thanatography in my short,
it would become the best one for sure.

562
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:47,118
And if I refused...

563
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:50,159
...he'd understand that...

564
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:53,311
...but he would have asked somebody else.

565
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,513
I couldn't refuse.

566
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:19,111
I tried so many times.

567
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:22,760
- You know, don't you?
- Don't do that, Leilou.

568
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:29,473
This is just... madness.

569
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:32,833
Please...

570
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:35,279
I beg you...

571
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:41,359
Please...

572
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:44,959
Free us.

573
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:52,318
This time I will succeed.

574
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:06,079
Choking is the best way...

575
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:08,549
...to capture the exact moment of death.

576
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:13,391
I'll capture your death through Bruno's eyes.

577
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:36,753
Forgive me.

578
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:39,759
I'm sorry, dear.

579
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:46,912
But this is my chance.

580
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:49,996
I knew it would happen here...

581
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:53,679
...and now I can finally
put an end to all this.

582
01:24:56,360 --> 01:25:00,592
I know what you want, Fumagalli...
I know what you were looking for.

583
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:02,193
So, let's do it.

584
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:10,155
Listen to me, Bruno: when I'll be dead...

585
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:13,835
...you'll have to finish the process...

586
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:17,233
...or else my sacrifice will be in vain.

587
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:20,154
I have a drawing in my trouser's pocket.

588
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:25,039
It shows how the device works.
Follow it carefully...

589
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:28,476
-...and do everything that needs to be done.
- Wait!

590
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,275
- We have to destroy those devices!

591
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:35,109
No! Once you have obtained what you need...

592
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:39,711
...there will be no more reason to destroy them.
It will be the end, Bruno.

593
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:44,511
Who said it would end?

594
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:46,993
Don't do it.

595
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:49,679
It's absurd!

596
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,752
It's absolutely useless!

597
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:57,593
- Mr. Astolfi!
- This will be the perfect thanatography.

598
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:06,953
Imago mortis...

599
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:10,357
...per oculos tuos.

600
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:36,633
What's happening?

601
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,399
Nothing.

602
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,871
Do you see anything?

603
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:53,679
No.

604
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:38,633
What were you going to do
for the "truth" theme?

605
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:42,275
Nothing.

606
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,232
- Nothing?
- Mh.

607
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:25,235
Oh...

608
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:51,714
