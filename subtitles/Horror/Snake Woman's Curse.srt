23
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,775
In the early days of the Meiji Period,

24
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,787
in the remote countryside
of northern Japan,

25
00:02:02,888 --> 00:02:08,793
where deep mountains
face the desolate Sea of Japan,

26
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:16,265
the village of Onuma had
not yet been westernized.

27
00:02:16,368 --> 00:02:17,996
Even if the people had wanted to fish,

28
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,605
there were no ports
a fishing boat could use.

29
00:02:20,706 --> 00:02:26,838
Villagers could survive only
by farming the meager soil.

30
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:35,644
The Onuma family, who owned the land,
were breaking the farmers' backs.

31
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,513
Come on.

32
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,556
Landlord! Please, landlord!

33
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,360
Sir, please!

34
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:25,868
Landlord!
Please don't repossess my field!

35
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:29,100
Please! Master!

36
00:03:29,241 --> 00:03:35,237
I will work harder than anybody else.
Please!

37
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:39,717
Yasuke, it's dangerous! Stay away.

38
00:03:39,818 --> 00:03:43,345
Please, landlord.
Without the field, I can't live.

39
00:03:43,455 --> 00:03:47,118
Please.
Please say something, master!

40
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:50,194
Please! Landlord!

41
00:03:50,295 --> 00:03:53,924
I'll pay off my debt.
I will definitely do it.

42
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,762
Please don't take away my field!

43
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:59,393
Sir! Please!

44
00:03:59,504 --> 00:04:00,631
Father! Father!

45
00:04:00,772 --> 00:04:03,366
- Please! Sir!
- Father!

46
00:04:03,475 --> 00:04:07,913
Landlord!
I can't live if you take the field!

47
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,211
Father!

48
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,442
Landlord!

49
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,219
Father!

50
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,484
What happened, Father?

51
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,490
Father, are you okay?

52
00:04:21,627 --> 00:04:23,788
Father! Father!

53
00:04:26,598 --> 00:04:27,918
- Are you okay?
- What's going on?

54
00:04:28,999 --> 00:04:29,729
- Father.
- Yasuke?

55
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,497
- Yasuke? Hang on!
- Are you okay?

56
00:04:31,637 --> 00:04:32,848
- Yasuke? What happened?
- Father!

57
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,170
Hang on, Father!

58
00:04:35,307 --> 00:04:36,433
Yasuke?

59
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:03,802
Landlord.

60
00:05:04,836 --> 00:05:06,031
Please.

61
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:08,971
Don't take the farm.

62
00:05:09,841 --> 00:05:11,002
Father.

63
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,011
Sutematsu.

64
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,148
Thank you.

65
00:05:16,882 --> 00:05:18,850
It's late. Please go home.

66
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,549
Please take care.

67
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,715
Thank you.

68
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,689
Please say hello to Matsugoro.

69
00:05:27,826 --> 00:05:30,317
Yeah.

70
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,454
My father will be shocked.

71
00:05:32,564 --> 00:05:34,156
Take care.

72
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,415
He isn't well yet.

73
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,920
Why did you let him work on the farm?

74
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:59,217
That was stupid.

75
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:01,326
My mother and I tried to stop him.

76
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:02,427
So foolish.

77
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,391
Sutematsu.

78
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:14,532
- When I feel jealous,
- Give me candies!

79
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,938
- I have a hard time,
- Give me candies!

80
00:06:18,076 --> 00:06:23,071
So I make a rice dumpling for the Buddha.

81
00:06:24,783 --> 00:06:25,909
Asa.

82
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,285
Kamekichi, do you have an errand?

83
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,889
I'm going to the next village.

84
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,184
You're working so hard.

85
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,451
By the way, how is Yasuke?

86
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:36,261
Thank you for asking.

87
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,626
Last night he slept well.

88
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,597
Well, I guess it was a bad day yesterday.

89
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,129
What's wrong?

90
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:47,466
Okay, I'll put you under hypnosis.

91
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,131
Hypnosis?

92
00:06:49,274 --> 00:06:54,473
Yes. Hypnosis will control
the threads of people's minds.

93
00:06:54,613 --> 00:06:55,705
The threads of minds?

94
00:06:55,814 --> 00:06:57,475
Don't worry. Close your eyes.

95
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,381
- Relax.
- Like this?

96
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,485
Yes.

97
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,555
Are you ready? Relax.

98
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:06,386
I'm hypnotizing you.

99
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:09,427
You're feeling...

100
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:14,660
When I feel jealous,
I have a hard time.

101
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,134
So I make a rice dumpling for the Buddha.

102
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,302
Kamekichi! Idiot!

103
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,905
So I make a rice dumpling for the Buddha.

104
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,978
Thanks for your help.

105
00:08:04,182 --> 00:08:06,617
Poor bird. You're hurt.

106
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:10,544
Sue! Sue!

107
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,468
Asa! Asa.

108
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,202
Trouble. Father is in trouble.

109
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,504
- Hurry!
- Father?

110
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,191
- Yasuke!
- Father!

111
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,419
- What happened, Father?
- Do you need water?

112
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,256
- Father?
- Let me go!

113
00:08:50,395 --> 00:08:52,863
- What did I do?
- Father?

114
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:54,728
After you get better, we will.

115
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:56,026
- Let go.
- Yasuke.

116
00:08:57,202 --> 00:09:01,502
I might die tomorrow.

117
00:09:01,606 --> 00:09:04,769
I have to see the landlord
and ask him something!

118
00:09:06,711 --> 00:09:08,611
I will ask him about you.

119
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,908
- Sue. Sue.
- Yasuke. Calm down.

120
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:14,348
Please wake me up. Please.

121
00:09:14,452 --> 00:09:15,783
Are you all right? Father?

122
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:20,882
If I die, you can't pay back the debt.

123
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:25,430
I have to ask him a
once-in-a-lifetime thing:

124
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,192
Ask him about the debt.

125
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:30,067
Father?

126
00:09:30,135 --> 00:09:32,467
- Yasuke?
- Here's his medicine.

127
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:33,981
- Father.
- Yasuke, take the medicine.

128
00:09:34,005 --> 00:09:35,199
Father.

129
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:40,067
I... Even if I have to eat dirt,

130
00:09:40,178 --> 00:09:42,442
for the master.

131
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:43,707
Landlord.

132
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:46,949
Please excuse me.

133
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,417
Please.

134
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,988
- Father!
- Yasuke!

135
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:52,750
- Father! Father!
- Yasuke!

136
00:09:52,857 --> 00:09:53,857
Hang on.

137
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,221
- Father!
- Yasuke!

138
00:09:55,327 --> 00:09:58,319
Father! Father!

139
00:10:09,341 --> 00:10:10,467
Landlord.

140
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,067
Even if I have to eat dirt,
I'll pay you back.

141
00:10:42,173 --> 00:10:43,333
Father.

142
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:49,111
From now on we'll try to help you.

143
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:51,774
Please let us know.

144
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,854
Yasuke passed away.

145
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:37,928
May he rest in peace.

146
00:11:40,732 --> 00:11:42,097
This is your condolence payment.

147
00:11:44,302 --> 00:11:45,701
Thank you.

148
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,738
Thank you very much.

149
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,571
Yasuke said that,
even if he had to eat dirt,

150
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:57,172
he wanted to work for you
until he was dead.

151
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,842
He was worried about the debt.

152
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:01,749
Regarding that problem,

153
00:12:01,886 --> 00:12:04,013
I need you to return the farm.

154
00:12:05,924 --> 00:12:07,084
But...

155
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:10,723
- It'll make us...
- Don't worry.

156
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,730
Sue will work in my main building.

157
00:12:13,832 --> 00:12:17,394
Tomorrow morning,
we'll teach you how to weave.

158
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:22,372
You two will work
to repay the debt.

159
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:26,103
We will tear down this place immediately,

160
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:30,746
to reclaim land here
and plant mulberry trees.

161
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,884
You have to prepare for it.

162
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,116
Do you understand that?

163
00:13:02,313 --> 00:13:03,313
Landlord.

164
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,659
- Do it.
- Yes.

165
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,201
You guys, too.

166
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,428
- Heave-ho!
- Do it.

167
00:13:26,538 --> 00:13:27,971
- You, too.
- Heave-ho!

168
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,872
Do it harder!

169
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,875
Heave-ho!

170
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,818
Heave-ho!

171
00:13:49,427 --> 00:13:50,485
Harder!

172
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,159
Take it all away.

173
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:59,166
Sue, come here.

174
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:06,969
Sue. This is best for you two.

175
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:09,706
Let's go.

176
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,519
There you go.

177
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,097
Come on.

178
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:28,392
Yes.

179
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:39,440
Hey, it's not like they're going to Hell.

180
00:14:39,577 --> 00:14:40,737
Eh, Sutematsu?

181
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,007
It might be worse than Hell.

182
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,119
Sutematsu!

183
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,721
What are you doing?
Get back to work!

184
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,749
It's a snake! Kill it!

185
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,019
No, don't!

186
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:05,197
Because of the interest,
Yasuke's debt has increased substantially.

187
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:09,107
From now on, you two will work to repay it.

188
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,901
Do you understand?

189
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:13,569
It will take ten years.

190
00:15:13,678 --> 00:15:16,442
During that period, of course,
I won't pay you any salary.

191
00:15:17,448 --> 00:15:20,713
But since I'm giving you free food,
you'll need to work hard.

192
00:15:20,818 --> 00:15:22,615
Takeo, take them away.

193
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:23,914
Sure.

194
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:39,096
Hey, Sue, listen.

195
00:15:42,307 --> 00:15:44,139
Now, do you understand?

196
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,139
Sue.

197
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:56,579
If you think that working here will be
easier than on the farm, you're mistaken.

198
00:15:57,722 --> 00:15:59,246
Yes.

199
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,127
It's so hot!

200
00:16:07,131 --> 00:16:08,325
It really is.

201
00:16:10,668 --> 00:16:12,466
If you have any questions,

202
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:15,004
or if others are bullying you,

203
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:16,766
you can ask me anything.

204
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:17,875
Okay?

205
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:19,203
Kuzu, she's new here.

206
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,437
She'll teach you, okay?

207
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:24,942
Good luck.

208
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:28,846
You will work there.

209
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,048
Listen, if you have any questions,

210
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,818
or if others are bullying you,

211
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,724
you can ask me anything, okay?

212
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:39,329
- Not okay!
- Kame!

213
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:44,161
1. WAKE UP AT 4 A. M.
2. WORK FROM 5 A. M. TO 9 P. M.

214
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:48,227
3. NO CHATTING AT WORK
4. TAKE CARE OF YOUR TOOLS

215
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:56,407
Whatever the weather, I keep weaving...

216
00:17:06,991 --> 00:17:13,954
I keep weaving...

217
00:17:16,367 --> 00:17:24,367
Weaving woman don't sleep...

218
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:40,013
don't sleep...

219
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:43,128
Oh, no!
You're doing it the wrong way.

220
00:17:43,261 --> 00:17:45,230
You're hopeless.

221
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:47,194
IF YOU WORK HARD,

222
00:17:47,298 --> 00:17:48,960
YOU CAN ENDURE SHORTAGE
AND DISCOMFORT

223
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,736
Don't slack off! Do it faster!

224
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,300
Carrying only one is too slow.

225
00:18:32,443 --> 00:18:33,933
Carry one more!

226
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:36,014
I can't see you work so sloppily.

227
00:18:37,648 --> 00:18:38,808
I mean it.

228
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:44,847
Kame! You don't need to help her.

229
00:18:45,656 --> 00:18:46,817
It can't be helped.

230
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:03,006
Sue.

231
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,871
You're doing great, aren't you?

232
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,111
What happened? You broke it!

233
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:14,278
Be careful.

234
00:19:16,587 --> 00:19:20,182
You, hitting on another man
so soon after your husband died!

235
00:19:20,992 --> 00:19:22,153
You're like a cat in heat!

236
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:27,827
Hey, Tora, watch out.

237
00:19:27,932 --> 00:19:29,559
Yes.

238
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:32,363
Red, red, red pepper is so hot.

239
00:19:32,503 --> 00:19:33,834
Heat, heat.

240
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,337
Tora, thanks for helping.

241
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,034
- Sure.
- Sue, that's a bad cough.

242
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:39,176
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

243
00:19:39,243 --> 00:19:41,734
Didn't your husband have the same illness?

244
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:47,681
My shoulder hurts.
I'd rather become sick and die.

245
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:52,086
Well, Mino and everyone,
I'll take care of the rest of it.

246
00:19:52,223 --> 00:19:53,247
Please take your baths.

247
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,326
Are you sure? Thank you.

248
00:19:55,426 --> 00:19:57,087
I appreciate it.

249
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:58,696
It's so hot.

250
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:02,392
Sue. Take care.

251
00:20:34,932 --> 00:20:40,132
I remember the sky
I saw this afternoon.

252
00:20:40,271 --> 00:20:44,264
Red, red, red pepper is so hot.

253
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,409
Heat, heat.

254
00:21:02,426 --> 00:21:03,586
Asa.

255
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,790
Mother!

256
00:21:14,472 --> 00:21:16,337
Is anything wrong with you?

257
00:21:16,474 --> 00:21:17,998
You look pale.

258
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:20,838
I'm all right.

259
00:21:22,013 --> 00:21:25,073
You've become really thin.

260
00:21:25,182 --> 00:21:27,151
Your work is hard, isn't it?

261
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:31,278
It's hard. But I'm still young.

262
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,857
It's tough for you, isn't it?

263
00:21:34,358 --> 00:21:35,916
I'm okay.

264
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,153
Look.

265
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,321
Eat some of these and get well.

266
00:21:39,463 --> 00:21:41,090
Can I take this many?

267
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,660
We can't eat it every day,
but sometimes we manage.

268
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,170
Thank you.

269
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,333
I will give some to the other girls.
They'll be happy.

270
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,876
That would be nice.

271
00:21:55,681 --> 00:22:00,174
Anyway, keep working hard,
and you'll get promoted soon.

272
00:22:00,318 --> 00:22:02,809
Take care, Mother.

273
00:22:04,855 --> 00:22:05,981
Thank you.

274
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:11,020
I'll visit you again.

275
00:22:28,446 --> 00:22:30,038
Sue.

276
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,512
How dare you steal them!

277
00:22:34,051 --> 00:22:36,144
You sneak thief!

278
00:22:36,253 --> 00:22:37,811
Please give her a break.

279
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:41,153
- Please.
- Kame, stay away.

280
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:43,385
Hey! You must apologize to her.

281
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,222
- Hey!
- Saiji.

282
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:06,210
You sneak thief.

283
00:23:07,551 --> 00:23:10,349
Starting tomorrow, you'll work outside.

284
00:23:10,454 --> 00:23:13,423
I can't let a dirty thief
stay in the house!

285
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:17,356
I was wrong. I'm sorry. So sorry.

286
00:23:17,461 --> 00:23:18,587
That's enough!

287
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:40,807
The village mayor is coming.

288
00:23:40,951 --> 00:23:43,647
Ma'am, the mayor is coming.

289
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:48,759
Welcome, Mayor.

290
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:50,986
- Hey, Kame.
- Please come this way.

291
00:23:51,128 --> 00:23:52,288
Good.

292
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:58,227
Thanks for coming on such a hot day.

293
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,634
No problem.

294
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:02,170
Please.

295
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:03,467
Thank you.

296
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:14,747
Congratulations, my young master.

297
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:18,016
The village mayor came today
to talk about your bride.

298
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:19,957
Congratulations.

299
00:24:21,992 --> 00:24:23,585
You're jealous, aren't you?

300
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:27,757
Young master won't act so filthy any more!

301
00:24:27,865 --> 00:24:29,127
Are you sure?

302
00:24:29,233 --> 00:24:30,427
You idiot.

303
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:36,097
- Snake! Snake!
- What happened?

304
00:24:36,907 --> 00:24:38,431
Saiji, kill it.

305
00:24:38,542 --> 00:24:39,668
Yes.

306
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,278
Please stop. Don't kill it.

307
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:45,042
Help it. Please help it.

308
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:48,019
- Please don't kill...
- Stay away.

309
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:50,014
Please.

310
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,956
What's the meaning of this?

311
00:24:53,057 --> 00:24:55,151
I feel so sorry for it.

312
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:58,122
It's ominous.

313
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:02,490
You know how important today is.

314
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:05,161
Are you trying to insult our Onuma family?

315
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:07,500
No, I'm not.

316
00:25:07,605 --> 00:25:09,073
- I just...
- No excuses!

317
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:10,868
Snake woman!

318
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,170
- Please forgive me.
- Don't touch it!

319
00:25:15,346 --> 00:25:16,507
Sue!

320
00:25:22,953 --> 00:25:26,548
It's so ominous. Hey, bring salt!

321
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:27,851
- Salt!
- Salt. Yes.

322
00:25:30,628 --> 00:25:31,822
Get her out of here.

323
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,391
Hurry.

324
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:36,657
Go.

325
00:25:47,645 --> 00:25:49,340
Lay her down now.

326
00:25:49,446 --> 00:25:50,879
Are you okay?

327
00:25:55,386 --> 00:25:57,684
It's terrible.
We should call a doctor immediately.

328
00:25:57,788 --> 00:26:01,280
You idiot.
You don't have to call a doctor.

329
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:04,559
Sue.

330
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:05,788
Hang on.

331
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,768
It's a lot of fun.

332
00:26:12,903 --> 00:26:14,394
If you cheat a geisha.

333
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:16,186
You'll have bad luck
for seven generations.

334
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,271
Of course, it was fun.

335
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,244
You'll have bad luck,
as they're all cats.

336
00:26:22,346 --> 00:26:25,645
It was so fun to get a lot of watermelons.

337
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:29,615
I know, I know so much about it.

338
00:26:31,288 --> 00:26:33,814
I knew everything from the beginning.

339
00:26:37,761 --> 00:26:41,892
It's a beautiful day today.
Congratulations.

340
00:26:42,933 --> 00:26:45,060
What about me acting as a go-between?

341
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,161
Ideal son-in-law?

342
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,234
Thank you for everything.

343
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:54,073
Good. No problem?

344
00:26:55,212 --> 00:26:57,976
Of course not.

345
00:26:58,115 --> 00:26:59,777
Right, Masae?

346
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:01,749
It really is a wonderful offer.

347
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:05,516
If her lips are thick,

348
00:27:05,656 --> 00:27:08,648
she is compassionate.

349
00:27:08,792 --> 00:27:12,125
The relationship between husband and wife
would be very deep.

350
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,924
Your young master is so sweet.

351
00:27:14,031 --> 00:27:17,432
You'll dote on the bride.

352
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:21,835
Your ear seems stiff and turned-up.

353
00:27:21,972 --> 00:27:24,441
It means you'll make a lot of money,

354
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:27,169
and your business will go well.

355
00:27:27,311 --> 00:27:30,769
It's so lucky.

356
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:33,715
Do you guys know who I was?

357
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:37,720
I was a soldier in the
Satsuma gun-fighters.

358
00:27:37,855 --> 00:27:39,653
This is the proof.

359
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:41,726
This stuff here.

360
00:27:41,859 --> 00:27:44,327
When I was in the gun-fighters...

361
00:27:50,734 --> 00:27:52,998
I carried the gun like this.

362
00:27:54,838 --> 00:27:58,798
What a lucky man...

363
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:04,644
is Mr. Wakamatsu.

364
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:05,875
Shoot!

365
00:28:21,865 --> 00:28:23,264
Sue.

366
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:24,698
I brought you food.

367
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,270
Why don't you eat some?

368
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,265
Sue.

369
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,201
Asa.

370
00:28:31,308 --> 00:28:32,707
What did you say?

371
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:33,834
Say it again.

372
00:28:33,944 --> 00:28:35,105
Asa.

373
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:43,119
Whatever the weather,

374
00:28:43,253 --> 00:28:49,954
I keep weaving...

375
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,756
Every night I have to work late.

376
00:28:54,898 --> 00:28:56,058
I'm really exhausted.

377
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,430
What the hell are you talking about?

378
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,903
Stop complaining.
Get back to work now!

379
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:05,104
Asa.

380
00:29:05,242 --> 00:29:06,300
There's trouble!

381
00:29:06,443 --> 00:29:07,774
Your mother is in trouble.

382
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,310
Hurry.

383
00:29:09,446 --> 00:29:11,073
Come with me.

384
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:12,479
Where are you going?

385
00:29:12,616 --> 00:29:13,810
You'd better come back soon.

386
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:16,212
Mother.

387
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,384
Mother.

388
00:29:22,326 --> 00:29:23,487
Mother, are you all right?

389
00:29:24,962 --> 00:29:26,123
Dead.

390
00:29:27,531 --> 00:29:29,328
I'm going to join your father.

391
00:29:30,501 --> 00:29:31,934
No.

392
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:34,766
Please don't die.

393
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:36,465
Sue.

394
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:37,768
What?

395
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,437
What did you say?

396
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:44,341
Asa.

397
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:47,407
Mother.

398
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,344
- Mother.
- Sue.

399
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:53,012
- Mother.
- Sue.

400
00:29:58,195 --> 00:29:59,321
Sue!

401
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:14,135
Hey, I feel sorry for Sue.

402
00:30:14,244 --> 00:30:15,643
Me, too.

403
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:17,305
Same here.

404
00:30:24,588 --> 00:30:27,022
- You scared us.
- Hey, what are you doing?

405
00:30:27,157 --> 00:30:28,215
Stop!

406
00:30:28,358 --> 00:30:30,326
Hey!

407
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:31,622
Don't!

408
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,390
Stop it.

409
00:30:35,532 --> 00:30:36,692
Please.

410
00:30:48,011 --> 00:30:49,172
Honey?

411
00:30:50,414 --> 00:30:51,575
What's going on?

412
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:42,926
You're alone, finally.

413
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:46,527
I want to die.

414
00:31:49,606 --> 00:31:50,606
I'd rather die.

415
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:56,276
You lost your mother and father.

416
00:31:56,413 --> 00:31:57,903
I understand how you feel.

417
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,813
Hey, cheer up.

418
00:32:02,819 --> 00:32:03,980
I'll be with you.

419
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,459
I heard that your mother
was driven to her death.

420
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:15,124
Damn it.

421
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,091
If you keep working there...

422
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:22,801
Someday, I will get you out of that house.

423
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,635
I have a huge debt.

424
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,751
I don't know when I can get out of there.

425
00:32:29,446 --> 00:32:32,677
Hey, whatever happens...

426
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:34,844
I will marry you.

427
00:32:40,223 --> 00:32:43,125
When the summer holiday arrives,
let's meet here.

428
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:05,706
Asa, I have something to tell you.

429
00:33:18,395 --> 00:33:21,558
Asa, I need your help.

430
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:25,327
I want you to visit the wholesaler in town
and give this letter to him.

431
00:33:25,435 --> 00:33:28,336
Yes, but...

432
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,365
Don't worry about the old man.

433
00:33:32,509 --> 00:33:36,708
Please start getting ready now so you
don't have to come back late at night.

434
00:33:36,847 --> 00:33:38,246
- Please.
- Sure.

435
00:34:15,952 --> 00:34:17,181
Please don't.

436
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,079
Shit.

437
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,249
Asa! Asa!

438
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:26,725
Please don't!

439
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,025
Stay quiet.

440
00:34:31,268 --> 00:34:32,292
Please don't!

441
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,398
Wait.

442
00:34:40,577 --> 00:34:41,737
Asa.

443
00:34:44,181 --> 00:34:45,546
Please don't!

444
00:34:57,961 --> 00:34:59,121
Idiot!

445
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:09,900
Asa.

446
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,652
Please don't.

447
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,280
Young master!

448
00:35:28,391 --> 00:35:30,154
Asa. Asa.

449
00:35:30,293 --> 00:35:32,955
Please don't do this. Please.

450
00:35:33,063 --> 00:35:34,257
Asa.

451
00:36:36,226 --> 00:36:37,887
- Asa!
- Asa!

452
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:46,231
- Asa!
- Asa!

453
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:52,005
- Asa!
- Asa!

454
00:36:52,108 --> 00:36:54,668
Hey! You go that way!

455
00:36:54,778 --> 00:36:56,336
Kame, you go this way.

456
00:36:56,447 --> 00:37:01,077
- Asa!
- Asa!

457
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,251
Asa!

458
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,420
I found Asa!

459
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:16,398
- You found her?
- We found her!

460
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,898
Asa! Asa!

461
00:37:18,802 --> 00:37:21,362
Asa! Asa! Are you okay?

462
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:26,909
I guess she escaped.

463
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:29,478
Lock her in the shed for a few days.

464
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:31,081
- Yes.
- It'll serve as a warning.

465
00:37:34,985 --> 00:37:36,748
Takeo.

466
00:37:36,853 --> 00:37:38,980
It's you who's responsible
for failing to supervise.

467
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:41,818
That's why she escaped.
You need a tight leash.

468
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:43,118
Yes.

469
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:14,490
Asa.

470
00:38:16,693 --> 00:38:19,992
Whatever happens, I will marry you.

471
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:33,605
You have to hurry up.

472
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:34,870
- Hey, watch out!
- Yes.

473
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:12,842
You've all done a fine job.

474
00:39:12,949 --> 00:39:15,918
I'll give you a bonus.

475
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,546
- Tami.
- Yes.

476
00:39:20,724 --> 00:39:22,487
It's your day off today.

477
00:39:22,592 --> 00:39:24,059
You can go anywhere you want.

478
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:30,097
- Mino.
- Yes.

479
00:39:30,233 --> 00:39:31,929
Thank you very much.

480
00:39:32,068 --> 00:39:34,333
- Iku.
- Yes.

481
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:35,638
- Thank you very much.
- Yoshi.

482
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,900
Thank you very much.

483
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:39,168
- Fuku.
- Yes.

484
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:41,870
- Thank you very much.
- Saki.

485
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,838
Thank you very much.

486
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:46,108
- Ume.
- Yes.

487
00:39:47,717 --> 00:39:49,344
- Thank you very much.
- Tome.

488
00:39:49,452 --> 00:39:50,784
Yes.

489
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,080
- Thank you very much.
- Haru.

490
00:39:52,222 --> 00:39:53,849
Yes.

491
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,035
- Thank you very much.
- Sayo.

492
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,458
Yes.

493
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:57,594
Thank you very much.

494
00:40:03,166 --> 00:40:04,724
Asa.

495
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:06,097
You stay.

496
00:40:07,771 --> 00:40:10,706
After all, you might escape again, right?

497
00:40:11,608 --> 00:40:15,635
What kind of look is that?

498
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:20,217
First of all, we can't afford
to give you a break,

499
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:24,481
as you're only a new worker here.

500
00:40:24,621 --> 00:40:26,088
Do you understand that?

501
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,885
Go and clean up the mosquito net.

502
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:30,721
Yes.

503
00:40:30,827 --> 00:40:35,458
When you're done with that,
polish all the lamps.

504
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,599
Yes.

505
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,638
Asa.

506
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:47,936
Be patient.

507
00:40:55,518 --> 00:40:56,518
Asa.

508
00:40:56,619 --> 00:40:58,416
Don't worry. Okay?

509
00:40:59,556 --> 00:41:01,353
Forget about what that old hag said.

510
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:02,981
Do you know what I mean?

511
00:41:03,126 --> 00:41:04,458
Now close your eyes.

512
00:41:04,561 --> 00:41:06,028
I'll put you under hypnosis.

513
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:10,099
Are you ready?
Look this way. Close your eyes.

514
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:11,634
Now you're ready.

515
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:17,195
Good. Hypnosis will disentangle
the threads of your mind.

516
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:21,436
When I feel jealous,
I have a hard time...

517
00:41:22,579 --> 00:41:23,603
- Kame!
- Yes.

518
00:41:23,713 --> 00:41:27,445
When I feel jealous,
I have a hard time.

519
00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:21,029
Are you Sutematsu?

520
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:23,766
Yes.

521
00:42:28,878 --> 00:42:30,607
Asa won't come.

522
00:42:31,748 --> 00:42:33,375
What?

523
00:42:33,483 --> 00:42:35,918
I'm sorry, but they didn't let her out.

524
00:42:36,052 --> 00:42:37,052
Why?

525
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:42,188
When she left for the town on an errand,
she tried to escape.

526
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:44,385
What? Escape?

527
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,362
That's ludicrous.

528
00:42:49,465 --> 00:42:53,266
She tried to escape
without telling me anything?

529
00:42:53,403 --> 00:42:56,429
I'm not sure if I should say this.

530
00:43:00,443 --> 00:43:01,723
Please tell me whatever you can.

531
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:05,603
This occurred to me afterward.

532
00:43:07,784 --> 00:43:11,379
It was the day the lightning hit.

533
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:15,082
When Asa went on an errand,
I saw the young master.

534
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:19,594
He was secretly heading
for the mountain from the back door.

535
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:21,631
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

536
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:24,661
From that day on,

537
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:27,669
Asa stopped talking,
as if she became another person.

538
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,829
And then,

539
00:43:30,974 --> 00:43:33,170
later that night, when we brought her back,

540
00:43:33,309 --> 00:43:37,336
Asa squinted at the young master
with such a terrible look.

541
00:43:38,648 --> 00:43:40,844
I might be wrong.

542
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:54,787
Being carried in a palanquin,

543
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:59,130
I felt as if I had become a monkey.

544
00:43:59,235 --> 00:44:03,934
- I was sold somewhere.
- Hey, dance with me!

545
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:07,670
So I work in the rest of my life.

546
00:44:32,335 --> 00:44:33,461
Please don't, young master.

547
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:39,007
- Asa.
- Please don't.

548
00:44:41,411 --> 00:44:42,411
Stay quiet.

549
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:47,313
Ouch! Damn it.

550
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:00,722
Please don't.

551
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:03,423
Asa, you're ruined.

552
00:45:04,934 --> 00:45:06,424
You can't get married to Sutematsu.

553
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:10,499
You're not a virgin anymore.

554
00:45:10,606 --> 00:45:11,766
You're ruined.

555
00:45:15,411 --> 00:45:16,571
Shit.

556
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:20,677
Asa.

557
00:45:21,751 --> 00:45:23,116
Wait.

558
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:24,845
Asa. Asa.

559
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:30,083
- Asa.
- No!

560
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:39,193
Let's go, Mother.

561
00:45:39,302 --> 00:45:41,532
Hurry, Mother.

562
00:45:48,144 --> 00:45:51,773
Hey, baby, have a good night's sleep.

563
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:57,309
You'll enjoy staying at Shinagawa Inn.

564
00:46:27,483 --> 00:46:28,643
Asa.

565
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:36,818
That day, when the lightning hit...

566
00:46:38,728 --> 00:46:40,320
Tell me what really happened.

567
00:46:40,463 --> 00:46:41,623
Hey.

568
00:46:41,731 --> 00:46:43,460
Tell me the truth. Honestly.

569
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:46,162
The guy who just left, did he...

570
00:46:50,907 --> 00:46:52,034
Son of a bitch.

571
00:46:55,978 --> 00:47:00,938
Why the hell didn't you resist the guy,
the goddamn son of a bitch? Why?

572
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:06,951
I asked young master not to do it.

573
00:47:09,425 --> 00:47:10,722
I hate him.

574
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,556
I hate young master.

575
00:47:12,695 --> 00:47:13,992
Idiot.

576
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:15,689
What young master?

577
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,664
What landlord?

578
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:19,326
You can't call him that.

579
00:47:22,505 --> 00:47:24,370
You should have killed him.

580
00:47:24,507 --> 00:47:28,705
Why didn't you resist
until you really killed him?

581
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,650
I can't live any longer.

582
00:47:36,753 --> 00:47:38,687
I'd rather die.

583
00:47:43,025 --> 00:47:45,858
Hey, look at them. So hot!

584
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:48,693
A thousand degrees hot.

585
00:47:48,798 --> 00:47:51,164
This is called "rabu-scene", isn't it?

586
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:54,327
No. "Labu-scene."

587
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:57,498
Love scene in English.

588
00:47:57,608 --> 00:47:59,166
Love scene.

589
00:47:59,275 --> 00:48:00,765
Hey, Sutematsu.

590
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:03,606
You have to buy me a drink.
You promised me that.

591
00:48:03,746 --> 00:48:06,943
Come and do your love scene later at night.

592
00:48:07,083 --> 00:48:08,243
Let's go.

593
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:14,621
- Love scene!
- Love scene!

594
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:21,961
Love scene! So hot!

595
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:33,568
Asa.

596
00:48:35,244 --> 00:48:36,404
Asa.

597
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:21,951
Mother.

598
00:49:23,726 --> 00:49:24,920
I'm ruined.

599
00:49:26,663 --> 00:49:28,460
I feel sorry for Sutematsu.

600
00:49:33,235 --> 00:49:34,964
Everyone's dead.

601
00:49:36,706 --> 00:49:38,971
I can't live anymore.

602
00:49:41,143 --> 00:49:42,167
What can I do?

603
00:49:43,713 --> 00:49:44,840
Come here.

604
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:47,516
If you come, you'll feel better.

605
00:49:49,753 --> 00:49:51,721
If you come, you won't suffer.

606
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,318
What happened?

607
00:50:22,418 --> 00:50:23,418
It's scary.

608
00:50:27,456 --> 00:50:28,821
What's going on, Kamekichi?

609
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:31,226
- Can you hear that?
- What?

610
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,556
- Can you hear that?
- What can you hear?

611
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,425
You're scared like a girl.

612
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:37,726
- It's scary!
- You're a coward.

613
00:50:37,867 --> 00:50:39,335
Are you really a man?

614
00:50:47,309 --> 00:50:49,539
- I'm scared!
- Be quiet.

615
00:50:50,813 --> 00:50:54,681
I went to the toilet outside just now.

616
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:57,553
- And...
- And?

617
00:50:57,653 --> 00:51:01,385
And something tripped me.

618
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:02,514
What was that?

619
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:05,254
It was too dark to see it clearly.

620
00:51:06,295 --> 00:51:08,456
It was squishy, something squishy.

621
00:51:08,597 --> 00:51:10,190
- Squishy?
- Yes.

622
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:14,066
When I looked carefully,
it seemed like a human being.

623
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:16,866
- A woman!
- Woman? Really?

624
00:51:16,972 --> 00:51:19,032
You're kidding again, Kame?

625
00:51:19,141 --> 00:51:20,233
It's true.

626
00:51:20,342 --> 00:51:22,777
So I asked, "Who are you?"

627
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,210
But she didn't reply.

628
00:51:34,824 --> 00:51:38,056
Do you remember
the newspaper article sometime ago?

629
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:40,595
About the girl who shaved her hair,
cut her throat,

630
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:42,494
and tried to commit suicide?

631
00:51:42,632 --> 00:51:44,566
The girl was like seventeen years old.

632
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:46,135
She was deceived by some guy.

633
00:51:46,268 --> 00:51:47,929
She was pregnant.

634
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:50,972
She cut her throat with the razor,
but she couldn't kill herself.

635
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:54,805
The blood was pouring from her cut throat!

636
00:51:58,681 --> 00:51:59,909
Hey.

637
00:52:00,016 --> 00:52:01,244
Asa isn't here.

638
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:02,510
- Asa?
- Yes.

639
00:52:21,137 --> 00:52:22,969
Takeo?

640
00:52:23,072 --> 00:52:24,335
Takeo.

641
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:25,963
What's going on?

642
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:28,340
- Snake!
- Snake?

643
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:29,604
There is no snake.

644
00:52:32,014 --> 00:52:33,710
You're half-asleep like a kid.

645
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:46,019
What the hell?

646
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,221
Rats again?

647
00:52:49,865 --> 00:52:51,025
Damn it.

648
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:39,244
Asa.

649
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,849
Asa. Asa.

650
00:53:53,896 --> 00:53:55,056
Who's there?

651
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:12,637
Asa!

652
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:14,937
Asa! Asa!

653
00:55:31,193 --> 00:55:32,456
The bride is coming!

654
00:55:32,561 --> 00:55:33,721
Come on!

655
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:19,067
You look really beautiful.

656
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,879
Takeo?

657
00:56:33,822 --> 00:56:35,119
Let's go to the ceremony.

658
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:44,798
What a lucky man is Mr. Onuma.

659
00:56:52,307 --> 00:56:56,574
What a lucky man.

660
00:56:56,679 --> 00:57:00,911
You'll prosper increasingly...

661
00:57:01,016 --> 00:57:04,782
in the future.

662
00:57:12,094 --> 00:57:16,588
What a lucky man...

663
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:23,070
is Mr. Onuma.

664
00:57:27,811 --> 00:57:34,682
You'll prosper increasingly in the future.

665
00:57:44,393 --> 00:57:46,293
Hey, where the hell do you think you're...

666
00:57:47,329 --> 00:57:48,956
Stop him!

667
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:54,134
You did a terrible thing to Asa!
I'll beat you to death!

668
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:56,204
What the hell are you talking about?

669
00:57:56,338 --> 00:57:57,338
Get out of here!

670
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,533
You bastard!
What the hell are you doing?

671
00:58:02,978 --> 00:58:04,138
Sutematsu!

672
00:58:05,981 --> 00:58:08,211
- Come any closer and I'll kill you.
- Sutematsu, don't!

673
00:58:14,858 --> 00:58:16,018
Stop him!

674
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:22,023
Hold him.

675
00:58:26,101 --> 00:58:27,568
You can't do it.

676
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:29,068
Damn it!

677
00:58:31,407 --> 00:58:32,567
This way!

678
00:58:38,447 --> 00:58:39,641
Where did he go?

679
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:43,681
Damn it.

680
00:58:43,786 --> 00:58:45,650
- You guys search that way.
- Yes, sir.

681
00:58:45,755 --> 00:58:47,382
We'll go this way.

682
00:58:47,523 --> 00:58:48,650
Come, hurry!

683
00:58:54,063 --> 00:58:55,394
Matsugoro.

684
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:58,763
Your son forgot
that he was just a tenant farmer.

685
00:58:58,902 --> 00:59:00,494
He put up a fight with me.

686
00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:02,900
I'm so sorry for what my son did.

687
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:06,173
He escaped into the mountains.

688
00:59:07,876 --> 00:59:09,936
- Please forgive us.
- Shut up!

689
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:12,707
Police officers,
please comb the mountains.

690
00:59:12,815 --> 00:59:15,340
- We'll arrange it right away.
- Please find him.

691
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:16,918
- Landlord.
- Shut up!

692
00:59:17,052 --> 00:59:19,384
You guys look for him
at the base of the mountain.

693
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:21,129
- Yes, sir.
- Please forgive us, landlord!

694
00:59:22,057 --> 00:59:23,684
Landlord!

695
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:25,784
Hurry!

696
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:29,064
Come this way!

697
01:00:08,538 --> 01:00:10,664
The crazy man from last
night, was he caught?

698
01:00:10,806 --> 01:00:12,398
No, not yet.

699
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:17,068
It was a special day for you.

700
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,338
You were frightened, weren't you?

701
01:00:20,483 --> 01:00:22,951
- Yes.
- Thank you.

702
01:00:24,519 --> 01:00:26,351
It's unjustified resentment.

703
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:29,423
Takeo didn't do anything wrong.

704
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:33,420
What's wrong?

705
01:00:46,242 --> 01:00:48,039
Here you go.

706
01:00:48,177 --> 01:00:50,144
I don't want it anymore.
Take it away.

707
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:52,009
But you should eat.

708
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:54,708
I told you I didn't want it!
Didn't you hear that?

709
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:02,621
Your mother seemed very terrified.

710
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:04,884
I'm scared.

711
01:01:06,094 --> 01:01:09,826
Well, she was just nervous.
Don't worry.

712
01:01:09,931 --> 01:01:11,455
She will get better soon.

713
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:14,400
- Kinu, come here now.
- Yes.

714
01:01:23,045 --> 01:01:24,307
You've gotten so tense.

715
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:27,349
You're so cute.

716
01:01:30,018 --> 01:01:31,178
You smell good.

717
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,059
What's the matter?

718
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:47,362
You...

719
01:01:51,974 --> 01:01:53,669
Young master.

720
01:01:53,775 --> 01:01:55,265
Please don't do this.

721
01:01:55,411 --> 01:01:57,106
Please don't do this to me.

722
01:02:00,282 --> 01:02:02,409
Young master,

723
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,383
please don't do this to me.

724
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:06,722
Darling!

725
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:40,387
Takeo, please stop acting
like a new bridegroom,

726
01:02:40,489 --> 01:02:42,252
and start working harder.

727
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:53,426
What are you doing?

728
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:54,628
She is a snake!

729
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:57,672
Snake woman! You!

730
01:02:57,806 --> 01:02:58,806
Father!

731
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:01,101
Takeo. Don't get rough with her.

732
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:02,210
Let me go!

733
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:04,506
Saru? Kame? Is anyone near here?

734
01:03:04,646 --> 01:03:06,114
You snake!

735
01:03:06,215 --> 01:03:07,477
Anyone?

736
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:11,109
Shit! Snake!

737
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:23,749
Kinu.

738
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:25,980
I'm not scared anymore.

739
01:05:26,922 --> 01:05:28,947
I'm fine with you being some monster.

740
01:05:29,090 --> 01:05:30,955
Don't tell me something so terrible.

741
01:05:31,092 --> 01:05:33,721
Please don't do things like that anymore!

742
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:36,297
Otherwise,

743
01:05:36,431 --> 01:05:38,331
I'll return to my parents' place.

744
01:05:38,467 --> 01:05:40,434
Sorry. I apologize.

745
01:05:42,304 --> 01:05:44,329
Is your burn all right?

746
01:05:44,472 --> 01:05:48,067
Yes. But it's itchy.

747
01:05:49,844 --> 01:05:51,436
- Would you scratch it?
- Sure.

748
01:05:54,115 --> 01:05:55,115
- Is it here?
- Yes.

749
01:06:11,967 --> 01:06:15,096
Honey, are you okay? Honey!

750
01:06:37,726 --> 01:06:41,025
- Help!
- A snake!

751
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:42,391
Please don't!

752
01:06:43,365 --> 01:06:44,559
Help!

753
01:06:44,699 --> 01:06:46,826
- Hey, what's going on?
- Anybody?

754
01:06:49,038 --> 01:06:51,233
- Anybody?
- Please help me!

755
01:06:51,373 --> 01:06:53,739
- Hey! Is anybody here?
- What are you doing to me?

756
01:06:53,876 --> 01:06:55,400
Hang on, young master.

757
01:06:55,543 --> 01:06:58,011
- Let me go!
- Young master!

758
01:06:58,114 --> 01:06:59,206
Young master!

759
01:07:01,416 --> 01:07:02,543
What are you doing?

760
01:07:06,121 --> 01:07:09,056
I'll kill anybody who gets in my way.

761
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:48,519
Young master.

762
01:07:50,065 --> 01:07:51,293
Please don't do this.

763
01:08:22,965 --> 01:08:24,454
Please don't do this.

764
01:08:26,202 --> 01:08:27,260
Young master.

765
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:30,570
- Please don't do this.
- Help me.

766
01:08:32,173 --> 01:08:33,640
Please don't do this to me.

767
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:36,444
Young master.

768
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:39,780
Please don't do this.

769
01:08:41,216 --> 01:08:42,274
Please don't do this.

770
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:45,278
Young master.

771
01:08:46,889 --> 01:08:48,288
Please don't do this to me.

772
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:23,822
It's an order from the police commander.

773
01:09:23,926 --> 01:09:26,520
Please come to headquarters immediately.

774
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:28,061
That's it.

775
01:09:29,864 --> 01:09:32,958
Police commander?
What good is the police?

776
01:09:33,068 --> 01:09:35,002
It's just plain rude. Go.

777
01:09:35,904 --> 01:09:37,064
Yes, sir.

778
01:10:30,391 --> 01:10:31,449
Landlord.

779
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:34,926
Even if I have to eat dirt,
I'll pay you back.

780
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:43,632
Commander.

781
01:10:43,771 --> 01:10:46,069
How can you believe these rumors?

782
01:10:48,644 --> 01:10:52,045
Mr. Onuma, why don't we talk quietly?

783
01:10:52,146 --> 01:10:53,613
It's rude.

784
01:10:53,748 --> 01:10:55,545
If you're acting like that, Commander,

785
01:10:55,650 --> 01:10:58,586
I will ask the prefectural
governor to fire you.

786
01:10:58,686 --> 01:11:01,780
We're just asking you,
in compliance with the law.

787
01:11:03,024 --> 01:11:05,219
I want you to answer my questions.

788
01:11:05,327 --> 01:11:06,487
What good is the police?

789
01:11:06,628 --> 01:11:08,619
Don't patronize me,
bragging about law and order.

790
01:11:10,832 --> 01:11:15,792
First of all, you reported
that your son died of illness.

791
01:11:17,171 --> 01:11:18,900
I also heard that he committed suicide.

792
01:11:19,007 --> 01:11:20,635
That's ridiculous.

793
01:11:20,775 --> 01:11:24,268
The doctor proved that
he died of heart failure.

794
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:27,315
Regarding that,
I need him to come here as a witness.

795
01:11:28,317 --> 01:11:29,443
Commander.

796
01:11:30,551 --> 01:11:32,246
Are you interrogating me?

797
01:11:32,354 --> 01:11:35,914
Not at all. But...

798
01:11:36,024 --> 01:11:38,288
I'm asking you in person, as a commander.

799
01:11:38,394 --> 01:11:40,862
I have nothing to hide.

800
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:46,199
Summoning me here!
You won't get away with it.

801
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:52,363
Second, you reported that Yasuke's wife
died of lung disease.

802
01:11:52,507 --> 01:11:54,372
It was lung disease.

803
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:56,637
All of her ancestors died of lung disease.

804
01:11:57,746 --> 01:12:01,806
The death of one or two tenant farmers
has nothing to do with me.

805
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:04,681
So you insist that you have
nothing to do with it?

806
01:12:04,819 --> 01:12:07,117
They were working for you.

807
01:12:08,489 --> 01:12:09,684
She died in your house.

808
01:12:11,359 --> 01:12:14,351
Do you think you can
take their lives so lightly?

809
01:12:16,398 --> 01:12:17,956
Commander.

810
01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:19,193
Your point is...

811
01:12:20,569 --> 01:12:22,628
you're doubtful about
the cause of Asa's death.

812
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:26,838
You're not sure about why Yasuke died.

813
01:12:26,942 --> 01:12:28,466
You're suspicious of me, aren't you?

814
01:12:30,511 --> 01:12:33,241
The lives of one or two tenant farmers.

815
01:12:33,381 --> 01:12:35,212
They're the same as worms.

816
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:37,181
Worms wriggling in the rice field.

817
01:12:43,559 --> 01:12:46,323
- What the hell?
- Mr. Onuma!

818
01:12:46,427 --> 01:12:48,327
- What's the matter with you?
- Commander!

819
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:49,920
Damn it!

820
01:12:50,064 --> 01:12:52,055
Mr. Onuma! What happened to you?

821
01:13:14,122 --> 01:13:16,420
I know we can't be together.

822
01:13:16,557 --> 01:13:18,548
Though I want to say good-bye to you.

823
01:13:38,613 --> 01:13:41,081
Why doesn't one of us
try acting as a medium?

824
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:43,316
Any volunteers?

825
01:13:43,452 --> 01:13:45,420
Who do you think can do it?

826
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:48,148
I think Kame can do it.

827
01:13:48,289 --> 01:13:50,554
- Right.
- Kame can do it.

828
01:13:51,527 --> 01:13:52,926
You can do it, Kame.

829
01:13:53,028 --> 01:13:54,222
No, I can't.

830
01:13:54,328 --> 01:13:55,625
I'm scared.

831
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:58,163
If I act as a medium,
dead people appear, right?

832
01:13:58,300 --> 01:13:59,460
No, I don't want to.

833
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,465
Kame, you're a man, aren't you?

834
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:03,969
You can't use hypnosis now!

835
01:14:04,105 --> 01:14:07,768
- Do it! Do it!
- Please don't.

836
01:14:13,481 --> 01:14:14,813
Excuse me, priestess.

837
01:14:14,949 --> 01:14:17,612
I've used hypnosis. Can I do it?

838
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:22,314
This will be "Hypnosis versus the Medium"!

839
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:24,649
Hey, Kinjo! Kinjo!

840
01:14:28,063 --> 01:14:29,859
Please begin.

841
01:14:29,997 --> 01:14:33,091
I know we can't be together.

842
01:14:33,202 --> 01:14:35,762
Though I want to say good-bye to you.

843
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,130
It's coming! It's coming!

844
01:15:03,664 --> 01:15:06,155
I'm begging you.

845
01:15:06,268 --> 01:15:12,332
My soul becomes like this.
Please don't forget about me.

846
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:19,403
When you can finally see
me, please talk to me.

847
01:15:23,851 --> 01:15:25,376
Young master.

848
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,886
Please don't do this.

849
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:29,581
I can't live anymore.

850
01:15:29,725 --> 01:15:31,158
That's Asa's voice.

851
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:32,351
- Really?
- Asa?

852
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:37,427
I want to die.

853
01:15:37,565 --> 01:15:39,533
Asa.

854
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:43,365
Why did you die, Asa?

855
01:15:49,610 --> 01:15:52,045
- I'm scared.
- No! It's creepy!

856
01:17:05,386 --> 01:17:07,081
- It's a snake!
- A snake?

857
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:11,952
Shut up!

858
01:17:13,395 --> 01:17:14,862
Listen up, everyone.

859
01:17:14,997 --> 01:17:19,365
When dawn breaks, burn away
all the mountain forest around here.

860
01:17:20,735 --> 01:17:21,760
Burn the snakes.

861
01:17:23,005 --> 01:17:24,336
Kill them all!

862
01:17:29,176 --> 01:17:30,336
Shut up!

863
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:37,646
Masae. Masae!

864
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:41,788
- Saiji.
- Yes, sir.

865
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:47,157
Drive nails into the shed,
and lock it up so no one can enter.

866
01:17:47,261 --> 01:17:48,261
Yes, sir.

867
01:17:48,363 --> 01:17:50,297
We'll stop weaving.

868
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:53,128
We'll fire all the weaving women.

869
01:17:53,234 --> 01:17:54,379
- Landlord!
- Do you understand?

870
01:17:54,403 --> 01:17:57,372
It's too sudden.
We'll all have a lot of trouble.

871
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:58,734
Shut up!

872
01:17:58,873 --> 01:18:01,206
Are you against me?
Get out of here.

873
01:18:01,342 --> 01:18:03,708
- Get out!
- Landlord, please.

874
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:06,871
We're very poor,
and can't survive if we have to go home.

875
01:18:07,015 --> 01:18:09,711
- Please.
- Landlord!

876
01:18:09,850 --> 01:18:13,719
Your people can survive
drinking water and eating anything.

877
01:18:13,854 --> 01:18:15,822
Please don't say that, landlord.

878
01:18:15,923 --> 01:18:19,552
We'll work day and night,
as much as possible.

879
01:18:19,694 --> 01:18:21,719
- Please let us work.
- Shut up! Stop it!

880
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:25,822
- Please.
- Kame, you're fired, too!

881
01:18:25,934 --> 01:18:27,162
- Get out of here!
- Landlord!

882
01:18:27,269 --> 01:18:29,896
Get out of here! Now! Get out!

883
01:18:30,037 --> 01:18:33,268
- Please let us work!
- Get out!

884
01:18:33,408 --> 01:18:34,670
Get out of here!

885
01:18:39,514 --> 01:18:41,038
Masae! Masae.

886
01:18:55,229 --> 01:18:56,355
Landlord.

887
01:18:56,465 --> 01:18:59,730
Even if I have to eat dirt,
I'll pay you back.

888
01:21:52,172 --> 01:21:53,367
Landlord.

889
01:21:53,475 --> 01:21:56,535
Even if I have to eat dirt,
I'll pay you back.

890
01:21:58,947 --> 01:22:00,710
Landlord.

891
01:22:00,814 --> 01:22:04,910
Even if I have to eat dirt,
I'll pay you back.

892
01:22:06,453 --> 01:22:08,216
Landlord.

893
01:22:08,323 --> 01:22:12,259
Even if I have to eat dirt,
I'll pay you back.

894
01:22:27,042 --> 01:22:28,805
Landlord.

895
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:33,176
Even if I have to eat dirt,
I'll pay you back.

896
01:22:35,015 --> 01:22:36,015
Landlord.

897
01:22:36,150 --> 01:22:39,278
Even if I have to eat dirt,
I'll pay you back.
