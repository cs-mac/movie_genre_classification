1
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,402
Evening, Dr. Kessler.

2
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:45,723
Front desk.

3
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,292
Yes, ma'am.

4
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,234
We'll certainly check it out.

5
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,837
-Right away.
-Problem, Lyle?

6
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,139
Miss Wells in 413.

7
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:04,114
She claims there are animal noises
coming from the room next door.

8
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,082
She thinks it might be a dog.

9
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:10,180
-She says it's keeping her awake.
-Are you going to check it out?

10
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:13,048
That's Dr. Kessler's room.

11
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:17,425
You know how he feels about people
going into his room when he's not in there.

12
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,554
He hasn't had--

13
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:21,463
The man is a weirdo, Lyle,
and a troublemaker.

14
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:25,971
And if he is keeping an animal,
he'll be out on the street before morning.

15
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:55,935
Damn!

16
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,577
Oh, God!

17
00:04:58,431 --> 00:04:59,398
Good God!

18
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,958
It's a child!

19
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:20,212
Lyle, it's me.

20
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,184
Call the police.

21
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,187
Just do it.

22
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:58,350
Hello.

23
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:42,528
Richard?

24
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:46,797
<i>Hi, I'm not here right now.</i>
<i>So after the beep, leave your name...</i>

25
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:50,426
<i>number, and a brief message</i>
<i>and I'll try and get back to you. Thanks.</i>

26
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,065
Hello, Richard, it's me, Virginia.

27
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:58,334
I just thought, maybe, you'd like
to come over for a beer or something.

28
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:01,242
I thought maybe you'd be home, but....

29
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,148
I'll be up for a while.

30
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,651
So if you get home before...

31
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:10,745
you know, too late,
just give me a call. Okay?

32
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,126
And....

33
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,528
Who is it?

34
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,496
<i>Police. Open up.</i>

35
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,740
Richard. Come on up.

36
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:46,712
Hi.

37
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,518
Are you okay?

38
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,816
Yeah, why?

39
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:08,324
You sounded a little agitated on the phone.

40
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,004
No.

41
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,537
That was just my phone voice.

42
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,970
Can I get you a beer or something?

43
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:22,409
Yeah, I'd love a cold beer.

44
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:26,679
Then why don't you
just go sit in there and I'll go get it for you.

45
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,036
"<i>Much of Madness, More of Sin</i>"?

46
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:52,303
"Tortured and ridiculed
by the scientific establishment...

47
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:56,074
"for his investigations
into the creation of superior life forms...

48
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:58,978
"noted zoologist Dr. Alan Kessler...

49
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,550
"continues his experiments...

50
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,281
"in the cloaked secrecy
of his basement laboratory.

51
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,914
"Finally, after years of failure
and frustration...

52
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:09,654
"he manages to successfully mate
his own seed with an egg excised...

53
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,860

54
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:15,263
"and plants it in the womb
of an unwitting human surrogate."

55
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:16,857
A little light reading?

56
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:22,673
So, scared yourself again
and lured me over with a cold beer...

57
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:25,573
-so you wouldn't have to be alone?
-You caught me.

58
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,038
Honey, how can you read this crap?

59
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:30,478
I don't know. It's some thing....

60
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:34,779
It's like potato chips, I just can't stop.

61
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,487
Potato chips?

62
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:47,464
I don't know, this one was different.
It was really special.

63
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,500
-Very well written.
-I'll bet.

64
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:55,367
What happens?

65
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,803
-With what?
-The book.

66
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,441
How does it end?

67
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,707
The surrogate dies in delivery.

68
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:08,111
Dr. Kessler has to raise the creature
as his own son.

69
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,749
But it's an evil, wild thing.

70
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,020
And he can't control it.

71
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,627
I know the feeling.

72
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:21,066
One night, somebody...

73
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,298
lets the jackal boy escape.

74
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:29,765
And Dr. Kessler goes out looking for it,
and he hunts it down.

75
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,205
Corners it in an alley.

76
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:36,209
And he begs it to come home with him.

77
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,012
But it hates him.

78
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,245
It hates him for bringing it into this world.

79
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,612
It turns...

80
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:48,056
and it leaps, and screaming in agony....

81
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:12,503
I don't see what the problem is.
It's not like he asked you to marry him.

82
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,743
-Yeah, well....
-Excuse me.

83
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,544
We've only been seeing each other
for six weeks.

84
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:23,383
He already wants me to meet his parents
over Christmas.

85
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,083
Crimson Falls, Ohio.

86
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,620
I don't know,
sounds like a pre-proposal to me.

87
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:30,990
Pre-proposal?

88
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,791
Excuse me.

89
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,293
I think I'll take these.

90
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:42,403
All I know is,
if I had a guy like Richard on the line...

91
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,006
I'd reel him in.

92
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,704
Yeah, I can see you
in a muumuu and curlers...

93
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,273
scrambling up eggs for your husband.

94
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:54,546
You don't know it, but deep down
underneath this chic, cosmopolitan savvy...

95
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:57,144
beats the heart of a submissive hausfrau.

96
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:01,457
Richard's really special,
but I think I'll just take it slow.

97
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,685
All I'm saying is, if I had Mr. Right...

98
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,390
I'd be home packing my bags
for Crimson Falls.

99
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:10,127
You're sure not gonna meet him
putting in 14 hours a day at this dump.

100
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:13,864
Maybe not. But I'm more likely
to run into a gorgeous guy...

101
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,771
in a bookstore
than a smart guy in a singles bar.

102
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:18,198
Hi, Mona!

103
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,047
Hi.

104
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:24,982
Then again, I could just kill myself.

105
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,948
What the hell are you looking for?

106
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,927
I'm looking for this book called <i>I, Madman</i>.

107
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:40,057
I've been looking for it everywhere.
But I can't find it.

108
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,727
It's by this guy, his name is Malcolm Brand.

109
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:49,066
-That's charming.
-No, don't knock it, it's really good.

110
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,436
It's horrific. It makes Stephen King
read like Mother Goose...

111
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,012
but it's passionate.

112
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,005
It's sort of like Poe.

113
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,443
-I never heard of him.
-I hadn't either until yesterday.

114
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:05,255
He wrote two of them, this one,
and one called <i>I, Madman</i>...

115
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,486
which came in with the estate sale. Crap!

116
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:16,801
-Where are you going?
-Upstairs, to have another look.

117
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:21,236
You sure are spending a lot of time
trying to find something called <i>I, Madman</i>.

118
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,387
-You find it?
-No, I didn't.

119
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,290
Maybe somebody bought it.

120
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,228
Yeah, maybe.

121
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:36,197
No, his mouth is stopp'd;
Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.

122
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,406
He is dead, my lord?

123
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,910
Had all his hairs been lives,
my great revenge...

124
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,981
had stomach for them all.

125
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:48,279
-Alas! He is betray'd, and I undone.
-Out, strumpet!

126
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:52,380
-Weep'st thou for him to my face?
-O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!

127
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,954
-Sorry I'm late.
-You didn't miss much.

128
00:19:57,062 --> 00:20:00,122
-Yeah, I can see that. Did he call us?
-No.

129
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:03,065
-Being done, there is no pause.
-But whilst I say one prayer!

130
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,295
It is too late.

131
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,930
I know about 20 people
who'd like to do that.

132
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,236
No, Collette's all right.

133
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:12,974
Any comments?

134
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:14,511
-No.
-Bravo!

135
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:16,843
Collette, Michael, very good work.

136
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:21,344
Our own Ms. Berkowitz is going to star
in a new made-for-television movie:

137
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:22,886
<i>No More Yesterdays</i>.

138
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:24,953
Congratulations.

139
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:32,027
You should have gotten that part,
you're absolutely perfect for it.

140
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,621
-Come on, Lenny.
-No, really. Perfect.

141
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:35,900
No.

142
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:39,900
-Collette's really talented and very beautiful.
-So are you.

143
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:42,465
I hate her.

144
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:49,004
How about dinner?
We'll talk about her behind her back.

145
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:52,049
No, I can't. I have plans with Richard.

146
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,044
Getting serious?

147
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:58,823
Maybe.

148
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,617
Okay, we'll take one more couple.

149
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:04,789
Kelly and Martin, please.

150
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:06,862
-All right!
-We're off the hook!

151
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,159
Look at this.

152
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,366
We're not going to get to do our Cyrano.
I bought a new nose and everything.

153
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:18,366
<i>Hi, it's Rich. Something came up here.</i>
<i>I pulled a narcotics stakeout.</i>

154
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,131
<i>I'm going to have to pass on dinner.</i>

155
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:24,806
<i>I'll try and stop by afterwards,</i>
<i>but if it's late, I'll call.</i>

156
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,472
<i>I miss you and I love you, honey. Goodbye.</i>

157
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,448
Oh, Mona!

158
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:45,340
Hello, Anna. It's been a long time.

159
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:47,482
Stay away from me.

160
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,483
But I fixed it, Anna.

161
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,486
What do you mean?

162
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,352
Look. A clean slate.

163
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,893
And a fresh palate.

164
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:58,756
Jesus!

165
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:04,851
What are you doing?

166
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:06,957
I was just...

167
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,359
making a fire, and...

168
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:13,368
I heard a noise.

169
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:17,333
Yeah, I knocked. Honey,
you've got to keep your front door locked.

170
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:19,735
Something on the stove?

171
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,847
Yes.

172
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,208
I was making some tea.

173
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:38,963
Great.

174
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:14,498
You okay?

175
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:18,866
Yeah. Why?

176
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,434
I don't know.

177
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:29,637
You just seemed to be
away there for a while.

178
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,314
I'm sorry.

179
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:38,382
How much do you love me?

180
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:43,621
On a scale of 1 to 10?

181
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,131
20.

182
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:51,631
Enough to cut off your ear?

183
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,337
No.

184
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,876
Yes. I don't know.
What kind of an idiotic question is that?

185
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,435
It's just this book I'm reading.

186
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:05,141
This guy, he's a poet.

187
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:09,778
He's a doctor, really,
but he sort of dropped out.

188
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:14,191
Anyway, he's madly in love
with this actress named Anna Templer.

189
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:18,989
She won't have anything to do with him
because she thinks he's really ugly.

190
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:20,927
She just can't get past it.

191
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,691
So, he cuts off his ear?

192
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:27,069
It's totally hopeless.
He's desperate to please her.

193
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:29,800
Then one night, he's been drinking heavily.

194
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:33,542
You'd have to be more than just insane
to have these thoughts.

195
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:38,038
He goes into his closet,
digging around for his old medical bag.

196
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:41,585
He finds it, takes it out, over to a mirror.

197
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:45,547
He pumps his face full of Novocaine,
and then, with his scalpel...

198
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:48,455
begins to slice away his features,
one by one.

199
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:51,023
And he's crazed with love!

200
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:52,923
So he slices off his face?

201
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:56,865
Great! The guy's never heard
of a candygram or flowers?

202
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,364
It's only a book, Richard.

203
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,997
It gives me the creeps.

204
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:05,004
Okay, we won't talk about it anymore.

205
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,077
You always get weird
when you read that shit.

206
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,613
If it'll make you feel any better...

207
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:18,755
first thing after breakfast...

208
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,926
I'll cut myself shaving.

209
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:24,820
Come here.

210
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:30,129
That's really sweet of you.

211
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:15,736
<i>I stood in the shadow of an alley,</i>
<i>watching and waiting.</i>

212
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:20,273
<i>Watching and waiting for that special one.</i>

213
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:25,484
<i>It had to be a woman's. I knew that for sure.</i>

214
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:30,755
<i>Only she spends the time</i>
<i>caring and cultivating...</i>

215
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:34,892
<i>and combing the silken crown.</i>

216
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:40,970
<i>A downy frame around a painting</i>
<i>as beautiful as the portrait itself.</i>

217
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:45,335
<i>They were all out.</i>

218
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,508
<i>The jet-blacks.</i>

219
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,745
<i>The mousy browns.</i>

220
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:01,255
<i>The bleached blondes.</i>

221
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:08,894
<i>But none was right...</i>

222
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:13,429
<i>until Red came along.</i>

223
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,143
<i>Good old Red.</i>

224
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,083
<i>It was perfection.</i>

225
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:32,452
<i>Soft as cloud and brilliant as sun.</i>

226
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:37,090
<i>Her flaming crimson torch of feathers.</i>

227
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:41,229
<i>Ready and ripe for easy picking.</i>

228
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:21,490
Oh, my God!

229
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,274
Can't somebody call the police?

230
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:10,805
Please....

231
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:17,050
Just a little something to help you sleep.

232
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:34,671
Now...

233
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:40,604
I would like you to count backwards
slowly from 100.

234
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:43,707
99.

235
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:46,777
98.

236
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:50,581
97.

237
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:54,185
96.

238
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:57,255
95.

239
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,590
94.

240
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:04,328
93.

241
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:07,431
92.

242
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:10,367
91.

243
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,104
90.

244
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:17,540
89.

245
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:20,377
88.

246
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,182
87.

247
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,288
86.

248
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:31,454
85.

249
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:41,431
82.

250
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:43,236
81.

251
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:47,311
80.

252
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:29,413
You like the color, Anna?

253
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,780
Miss? Are you getting on or what?

254
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:22,326
Jesus Christ, Mona!

255
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:25,834
I'm sorry.
I thought he was in the back with me.

256
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,238
He scared the shit out of me.
Where did he come from?

257
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:32,639
I found him. I figured
we could keep him here. He's mouse patrol.

258
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:34,938
-Oh, God.
-Boy, are you jumpy.

259
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:39,541
I thought you weren't coming to work
till 4:00 today.

260
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:44,314
The book! First edition Hemingway.

261
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:48,654
Old lady Vettey came in yesterday
after you left.

262
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:52,422
She had a shit-fit when she saw
that stuff hadn't been unpacked yet.

263
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:55,332
-What stuff?
-That stuff upstairs.

264
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,128
The estate sale shipment.

265
00:38:58,069 --> 00:38:59,093
Oh, yeah.

266
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,170
I'll clean this up.

267
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:04,372
Okay, I'll unpack the stuff.

268
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:23,193
"Malcolm Brand"?

269
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:49,650
"Malcolm Brand."

270
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:11,206
Who'd want to buy a used sex manual?

271
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:15,870
-Mona, where did you find this book?
-What are you talking about?

272
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:22,151
-Didn't you leave this outside my door?
-Isn't this the book you're looking for?

273
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:24,918
I didn't find it.

274
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:56,451
<i>-Yeah, Channing's desk.</i>
-Detective Channing, please.

275
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:59,919
<i>-He's not in.</i>
-Hi, this is Virginia Clayton.

276
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:02,748
I called before. I'm a friend of Richard's.

277
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:05,222
-Is he back yet?
<i>-No.</i>

278
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:08,527
<i>But I gave him your message</i>
<i>about a half-hour ago.</i>

279
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:12,525
I know. But it's very important
that he calls me back.

280
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:17,237
<i>All I can do is give it to him again.</i>
<i>I'm sure he'll call you back.</i>

281
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:19,372
-Yes, thank you.
<i>-Okay.</i>

282
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:22,078
Have him call me back as soon as possible.

283
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:23,180
<i>Okay.</i>

284
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:02,146
<i>...completely bald. A chrome dome.</i>
<i>A cue ball.</i>

285
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,048
<i>But just look at these results!</i>

286
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:08,022
<i>With daily applications</i>
<i>of our advanced formula, hair growth....</i>

287
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:22,596
Do you like the music?

288
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:32,039
Why are you doing this to me?

289
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,672
Lovely.

290
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:40,116
Please...

291
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:42,109
leave me alone.

292
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:44,853
You'll come around, Anna.

293
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:46,956
You will love me.

294
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:50,686
No, I don't love you. I'll never love you!

295
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:54,762
You can't mean that.

296
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:08,967
<i>911. Is this an emergency?</i>

297
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:12,035
Yes, there's a murder,
it's about to happen. I think.

298
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:15,543
<i>-The address, please?</i>
-On Wilshire and St. Paul.

299
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:18,881
The Piano Repair Restoration.

300
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:21,780
<i>Can I have your name, please?</i>

301
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:36,633
Stop it!

302
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:40,102
I closed the book.

303
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:44,674
Stop it!

304
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:24,975
Step back, please.

305
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:28,313
Navarro's upstairs.
Forensic's stuff will take a half an hour.

306
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:33,888
Come on, this way.

307
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,489
Step back, please.

308
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:36,852
Here you go.

309
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:40,287
Watch your heads, boys.

310
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:44,561
-Frank.
-Yeah?

311
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:47,401
-Any news about the witness?
-Not a word.

312
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:48,800
Check this out.

313
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:00,341
-Hey, Channing.
-Hi.

314
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:03,113
Hello, gentlemen.

315
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,448
Bag those up, please.

316
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:08,047
-We got anything?
-Well, not much.

317
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:12,094
Male, probably 6'2" or 6'3".

318
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:15,193
-Didn't leave any fingerprints.
-Look at this.

319
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,463
Son of a bitch sliced his ears off.

320
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:30,838
Excuse me.

321
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:33,115
I believe that shade was down.

322
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:07,940
It's me, Richard. Open the door!

323
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:16,854
Did you see it?

324
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:19,091
-Did you make the call?
-Yes.

325
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,193
Can you identify him, honey?

326
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:24,357
Richard, I'm so scared.

327
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:28,064
It's okay. It'll be all right.

328
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:36,405
All-righty.

329
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,940
How about...

330
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:41,985
that?

331
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:44,644
Yeah. That's the right shape.

332
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:49,653
-But they have to be closer together.
-Closer together, all right.

333
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:54,027
No problem. How about that?

334
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:55,495
Yeah, that's it.

335
00:48:56,166 --> 00:48:57,133
Terrific.

336
00:48:57,868 --> 00:48:59,460
Let's work on the nose.

337
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:02,969
There's no nose.

338
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:05,597
No nose.

339
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:10,071
He usually wears a scarf
over the bottom half of his face.

340
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:13,111
But he's showed me a couple of times.

341
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:14,711
He showed you?

342
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:19,646
That he doesn't have one. Not yet, anyway.

343
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:23,452
-He doesn't have one what?
-A nose.

344
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:28,789
It's like his hair.
He didn't have that until he killed Collette.

345
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:34,665
-And now he's got that guy's ears.
-Collette Berkowitz, the actress?

346
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,604
She was in my acting class.

347
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:46,139
You're saying it's the same guy
who killed the Berkowitz woman?

348
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:53,579
How do you know that?

349
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:56,993
Because he showed me
this morning, on the bus.

350
00:49:58,028 --> 00:50:02,328
Virginia, honey,
we're not following you here.

351
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:04,957
Why don't we just
take it from the top, okay?

352
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:10,133
-It all started with the book.
-A book?

353
00:50:11,808 --> 00:50:13,173
Richard knows about it.

354
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:16,109
It's this weird book
that I picked up where I work.

355
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,611
-Somehow this character got out.
-He got out?

356
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:21,508
He got out of the book.

357
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:27,546
One minute I was reading about him,
and the next minute he was next to me.

358
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:30,387
He thinks that I'm this actress
named Anna Templer.

359
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:32,086
She's in the book, too.

360
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:34,095
And he doesn't have a nose?

361
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:36,188
He doesn't have anything. He cut it all off.

362
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:40,531
His hair, his ears, his lips,
and his nose. Everything.

363
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:42,598
And now he's going to go around...

364
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:46,642
and take things from other people
so he can graft them onto his own face.

365
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:56,745
Miss Clayton, why would he....

366
00:50:58,588 --> 00:51:00,681
Why would anybody do such a thing?

367
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:04,125
Because he thinks that it will please me.

368
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:07,756
He thinks that it will please Anna.

369
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:12,266
But because he thinks I'm Anna,
it's really the same thing, right?

370
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:17,533
I want to thank you very much
for coming in.

371
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:20,769
Look, I mean,
I know this must sound really crazy.

372
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:24,142
No, really. You've been a big help.

373
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:32,611
Detective, when you have a moment,
my office, please?

374
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:44,129
Can you give me a minute here, please?

375
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:45,966
Yeah. Sure.

376
00:51:56,012 --> 00:51:57,707
What is happening to you?

377
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,651
-Richard, I know it sounds crazy.
-You're damn right it sounds crazy.

378
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:10,521
If you don't believe me,
you should read the book.

379
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:13,926
-It's all right there.
-I don't have to read the book. It isn't real!

380
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:19,300
Sorry to interrupt.

381
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:21,097
Garber's waiting, Richie.

382
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:27,767
I know you had a terrible night.

383
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:33,249
Why don't you wait downstairs for me
and when I finish with the lieutenant...

384
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:36,982
we'll go home and try and figure out
what you think you saw.

385
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:40,885
Please, just wait for me downstairs?

386
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:42,853
Okay, Richard.

387
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:15,757
Going down?

388
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,165
Why don't you leave me alone!

389
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:27,634
Why are you doing this?

390
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,298
Stay away from me!

391
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,133
I want you, Anna.

392
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:35,573
-You're all I ever wanted.
-Stay away!

393
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:41,280
This isn't happening.
This is just in my mind.

394
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:44,876
Things will be better, Anna.
Soon you'll love me as much as I love you.

395
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:46,319
No, I'm not Anna!

396
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:49,725
I'll have your heart one way or another.

397
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:52,761
Just go ahead and kill me, then.
Get it over with.

398
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:55,028
Get it over with.

399
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:16,750
Are you all right?

400
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:31,257
Sure you're all right?

401
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:07,601
"Non-fiction."

402
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:48,970
Look, Mel, I don't want to hear from strikes.

403
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:52,139
Look, Mel, I don't give a shit
about your labor problems!

404
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:54,142
I've got orders to fill.

405
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:59,051
I need 1,000 copies of <i>East Of Edith</i>
by Friday or I'm finished with this business!

406
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:01,715
Yeah, but look,
have the wrappers been printed yet?

407
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:10,229
Look, check the warehouse.

408
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:13,402
We got a load of that western title
that didn't sell.

409
00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:16,098
Yeah, <i>Long In The Saddle</i>.

410
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:20,665
Yeah, just switch the covers.

411
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:26,708
Mel, nobody's going to know the difference.

412
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:29,751
Nobody gives a shit, believe me!

413
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:36,447
Look, I got someone in the office.
I'll call you back.

414
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:43,093
-Are you Sidney Zeit?
-No. I'm Nelson Doubleday.

415
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:44,493
What can I do for you?

416
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:47,365
Well, actually, sir, if you don't mind...

417
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:50,803
-I have something I'd like to show you.
-I only publish smut.

418
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:54,633
I would love to chat with you,
but I've got a lot of work to do.

419
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:58,374
Did you publish this book?

420
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:07,752
So my moniker's all over it.

421
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:11,721
-What is it to you?
-I want to know about Malcolm Brand.

422
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:17,126
I wasn't married to the guy.
I just published a couple of his books.

423
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,068
Please.

424
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:23,906
You doing a paper or something?

425
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:26,642
College?

426
00:57:29,512 --> 00:57:32,879
I don't know what to tell you.
The books speak for themselves.

427
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:34,574
The guy was a lunatic.

428
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:37,811
Spent the last year of his life
in a rubber room.

429
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:41,986
That's where he wrote the last one.
One day he just took a powder.

430
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:44,184
Walked right out through the gate.

431
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:48,126
Nobody paid any attention.
Found him nearly a week later.

432
00:57:49,098 --> 00:57:52,033
Said it was exposure,
but they couldn't be sure.

433
00:57:52,936 --> 00:57:54,335
Why not?

434
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:57,902
Because by the time they got to him,
his body was ripped apart...

435
00:57:58,007 --> 00:58:01,875
by some animals.
Probably a pack of hungry dogs.

436
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:05,476
He was a weirdo, all right.

437
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:07,447
I remember once...

438
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:12,849
-right after his first book....
-<i>Much of Madness, More of Sin</i>.

439
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:15,424
Yeah, that's the one. Did pretty well.

440
00:58:15,558 --> 00:58:17,685
And even had a bit of a following.

441
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:20,027
Anyway, I got him an assignment.

442
00:58:20,129 --> 00:58:22,962
A short story. <i>Esquire</i>, kiddo.

443
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:25,326
And we're talking about the mainstream.

444
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:26,834
And they wanted him.

445
00:58:26,936 --> 00:58:29,461
So Malcolm started working on her
right away.

446
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:32,632
Two months later,
he returns the advance money...

447
00:58:32,742 --> 00:58:35,040
and tells me he can't finish the story.

448
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:38,511
And get this: claims the characters
were talking back to him.

449
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:40,411
Refusing to do what he says.

450
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:44,909
One even chased him out of town
for a couple of weeks.

451
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:48,218
The monster from the first book.
You know, the jackal boy.

452
00:58:48,424 --> 00:58:49,948
Claims he had hated him.

453
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:53,654
Was hunting him down.
Some return of evil for evil.

454
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:58,927
-You published this book as nonfiction.
-Both books were nonfiction.

455
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:02,095
Malcolm insisted.
Claimed they were confessions.

456
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:05,398
He was a ranting schizophrenic.

457
00:59:05,775 --> 00:59:07,902
Of course, nobody believed
anything he said.

458
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:11,105
So this stuff in the book,
about what he did to himself....

459
00:59:12,815 --> 00:59:13,782
Oh, yeah.

460
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,787
He messed himself up pretty bad, all right.

461
00:59:20,323 --> 00:59:21,756
Yeah.

462
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,401
Okay. You got the coroner on three
and your girlfriend's on one.

463
00:59:34,504 --> 00:59:37,302
All right,
just call me if you find anything else.

464
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:42,271
Dr. Price, could you hold on for
just one minute? I appreciate it. Thank you.

465
00:59:45,548 --> 00:59:47,516
<i>Why didn't you wait for me downstairs?</i>

466
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:48,675
<i>Where are you?</i>

467
00:59:48,785 --> 00:59:51,219
Listen, you're never going to believe this.

468
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:53,983
<i>-I know where he's going.</i>
-What are you talking about?

469
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:58,355
There's going to be another killing, tonight.
Another guy.

470
00:59:59,362 --> 01:00:03,423
A Mediterranean type.
Olive skin with a strong Roman profile.

471
01:00:03,566 --> 01:00:07,002
Brand's going to follow him home
from a bar downtown on Grant.

472
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:09,301
I can't talk about this now.

473
01:00:09,405 --> 01:00:11,930
The phones are ringing,
I've got two murders to solve--

474
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:14,771
Richard, listen to me!
I'm telling you, it's Brand.

475
01:00:14,877 --> 01:00:18,278
He's back to finish what he started,
what he wrote about in the book!

476
01:00:18,381 --> 01:00:21,077
I'm telling you that I don't believe in ghosts!

477
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:23,319
Just hold on for a minute, all right?

478
01:00:23,419 --> 01:00:25,683
Dr. Price, thanks for.... Oh, shit!

479
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:33,762
Fuck!

480
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:50,545
-Waiting for a bus, little girl?
-Jesus Christ, Lenny.

481
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:52,075
Hey, I'm sorry.

482
01:00:57,620 --> 01:01:00,054
-Are you waiting for someone?
-No.

483
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:03,723
Well, yes, actually.
I was waiting for an old friend.

484
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:07,886
That's something about Collette.

485
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:10,497
-It's a terrible thing.
-It's horrible.

486
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:17,101
I was thinking of picking up
a pizza and going home.

487
01:01:17,206 --> 01:01:20,767
You're welcome to join me.
I mean, if your friend doesn't show up.

488
01:01:22,645 --> 01:01:25,910
Thank you, but I'll just wait here
for a little while longer.

489
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,277
Thanks, anyway.

490
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:28,644
Okay. Sure.

491
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:33,254
-Some other time, then?
-Okay.

492
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:39,256
-I'll see you in acting class.
-Okay. See you later.

493
01:02:41,057 --> 01:02:44,254
<i>54-1. 54-1. Advise for code four.</i>

494
01:02:51,834 --> 01:02:53,825
-Evening, Lieutenant.
-Evening.

495
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:59,441
-Okay, what do we got here?
-Another mutilation, sir.

496
01:03:00,209 --> 01:03:01,904
He got the nose this time.

497
01:03:06,649 --> 01:03:10,278
-I understand we have a witness?
-Yes, sir. She's right over there.

498
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:15,616
Oh, hell.

499
01:03:16,492 --> 01:03:18,653
-Sir?
-Nothing.

500
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:20,888
-Where's Channing?
-He's on his way.

501
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:22,488
Come here.

502
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:34,772
-Virginia? Thanks, I've got it. It's okay.
-Richard!

503
01:03:34,877 --> 01:03:39,143
Richard, do you know who that is?
That's Lenny, from my acting class.

504
01:03:39,248 --> 01:03:42,342
-What are you talking about?
-I knew this was gonna happen!

505
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:45,284
It's word for word out of the book.
The bar, the alley.

506
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:48,255
I couldn't do anything!
I couldn't make it stop.

507
01:03:48,424 --> 01:03:51,393
It's okay. Just come over here
and tell me what happened.

508
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:54,725
Damn it, where were you?
Why didn't you listen to me?

509
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:58,494
-Why did you hang up the phone?
-I didn't hang up on you, okay?

510
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:00,295
It was crazy when you called.

511
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:04,635
-I just hit a button and--
-And you just couldn't deal with it, right?

512
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:09,475
You couldn't deal with it. That there might
be some truth in what I'm saying!

513
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:12,037
I'm sorry, okay?

514
01:04:12,582 --> 01:04:16,245
Maybe I should have looked
into this thing a little more than I did.

515
01:04:16,419 --> 01:04:20,856
Garber had us running down other leads.
He's my boss, what am I supposed to do?

516
01:04:21,757 --> 01:04:24,920
You should just read the book,
Richard, please!

517
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:26,892
And then we'll talk about it.

518
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:41,002
Okay, all right,
I admit there are certain similarities.

519
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:42,940
I'll even go as far as to say...

520
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:45,479
that maybe there's
some copycat killer out there.

521
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:49,813
Somebody who's read the book
and is getting off on the gore. I don't know.

522
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:54,489
That's fine, but it doesn't explain
Malcolm Brand showing up in my apartment.

523
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:58,022
Let's stick close to earth
for the time being, all right?

524
01:04:58,127 --> 01:05:01,619
We have to figure out when this maniac
is going to strike next.

525
01:05:03,966 --> 01:05:06,935
It's right here. It's here in Chapter 8.

526
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:12,030
"I watched her before.

527
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:16,703
"Perched behind her desk,
lonely lady librarian, love-starved swan.

528
01:05:17,813 --> 01:05:21,943
"How I imagined her sweet, full lips
burning passionately against her pillow...

529
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:26,351
"late at night when the stone-cold cats
ceased standing guard over her lust."

530
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:29,155
He means the library.

531
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:33,194
I mean, it's all right here.
Right down to the stone-cold cats.

532
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:37,162
He means the lions
outside the steps of the main branch.

533
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,692
Do you see?

534
01:05:57,987 --> 01:05:59,784
So what happened in the end?

535
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:02,184
To the girl, I mean, Anna.

536
01:06:03,526 --> 01:06:05,118
You don't want to know.

537
01:06:12,201 --> 01:06:13,259
Yes, I do.

538
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:21,909
He cuts out her heart with his scalpel,
and he wears it around his neck.

539
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:26,111
Like a crucifix.

540
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:34,314
Close to his own heart.

541
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:59,047
-Hello?
-Looks like we're in luck.

542
01:06:59,148 --> 01:07:02,413
Garber's letting us go for it,
and throwing in some uniforms.

543
01:07:02,551 --> 01:07:04,348
That's great news, Richard.

544
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:09,253
It took some doing, but he's desperate.

545
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:11,217
<i>And if we're wrong....</i>

546
01:07:11,327 --> 01:07:14,819
We're not wrong. I'm positive about this.
He'll be there tonight.

547
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:18,991
All right, the library closes at 8:00.
Can you be there in half an hour?

548
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:20,799
In half an hour?

549
01:07:21,804 --> 01:07:23,328
Okay, I'll be there.

550
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:34,640
Mona, I'm gonna leave work
a little early tonight. All right?

551
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:36,083
Fine.

552
01:07:36,185 --> 01:07:37,152
Okay.

553
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:42,416
-Mona, is there something wrong?
-No, nothing.

554
01:07:43,259 --> 01:07:46,387
Nothing's wrong. You've walked
around here like a zombie all day.

555
01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:49,123
You haven't said two words to me
since you got here.

556
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:53,429
I'll be stuck here doing your work
while you run all around fighting crime.

557
01:07:53,536 --> 01:07:56,403
It's the estate sale stuff.
I forgot to unpack it.

558
01:07:56,505 --> 01:07:59,440
The least you can do is let me in
on what's going on.

559
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:01,739
I will. I'll call you later.

560
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:04,610
I'll unpack that stuff tomorrow morning.

561
01:08:05,281 --> 01:08:06,248
Okay?

562
01:08:06,949 --> 01:08:08,314
No, forget about it.

563
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:10,314
I'll finish it off tonight.

564
01:08:11,353 --> 01:08:12,411
All right.

565
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:16,123
Okay, I'm gonna go.

566
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:22,931
I'll call you later.

567
01:08:24,366 --> 01:08:26,630
Okay. Thanks, Mona.

568
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:27,929
Yeah. Go.

569
01:08:45,988 --> 01:08:50,152
<i>Okay, Joey, the place is secure.</i>
<i>Everyone should be out in four minutes.</i>

570
01:08:58,467 --> 01:08:59,434
Marian...

571
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:03,662
if you see or hear anything,
anything at all, you let us know.

572
01:09:03,772 --> 01:09:05,933
-We'll be listening on that radio.
-Okay.

573
01:09:07,109 --> 01:09:10,237
The rent-a-cops have all been briefed.
Business as usual.

574
01:09:10,346 --> 01:09:12,041
Good, you understand that?

575
01:09:12,214 --> 01:09:14,705
It's possible he's been watching you
for a few days.

576
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:16,751
Don't do anything unusual.

577
01:09:17,186 --> 01:09:20,485
What you normally do when you lock up,
do the same tonight.

578
01:09:20,589 --> 01:09:22,352
All right, kids, showtime.

579
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:26,024
There, almost set.

580
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:30,098
-You're sure you're okay?
-Yeah.

581
01:09:31,066 --> 01:09:32,158
Here we go.

582
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:40,635
-Is everybody ready?
-I think I....

583
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:03,621
-You're sure you want to do this?
-No.

584
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:08,096
Not particularly, but I'm the only one
who fits the suit.

585
01:10:14,076 --> 01:10:15,134
All right?

586
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:49,506
<i>Oh, my God, it's really dark down here.</i>

587
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:53,582
<i>Hello?</i>

588
01:10:54,216 --> 01:10:56,184
<i>Hope you guys can hear me.</i>

589
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:11,918
Okay, I'm in the microfiche room.

590
01:12:28,811 --> 01:12:31,439
<i>Wait. I think I hear something.</i>

591
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:32,911
Where is she?

592
01:12:40,122 --> 01:12:41,384
It's footsteps.

593
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:45,057
<i>There's somebody out in the hall.</i>

594
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:50,792
<i>-They're coming closer!</i>
-That's it, go!

595
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:51,866
<i>Richard!</i>

596
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:07,572
He's in the room.

597
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:09,611
Richard, he's in the room.

598
01:13:19,495 --> 01:13:21,087
Freeze, police officer!

599
01:13:37,846 --> 01:13:38,835
Coffee?

600
01:13:43,852 --> 01:13:46,184
I'll have a uniform
take you back to my place.

601
01:13:46,288 --> 01:13:48,256
And I'll be there as soon as I can.

602
01:13:48,357 --> 01:13:50,791
What, that's it? You're just gonna give up?

603
01:13:51,126 --> 01:13:53,651
He didn't show up. What can we do?

604
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:59,196
Listen, Richard, it's gonna happen tonight.
I mean, maybe not here, but somewhere.

605
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:03,466
If it hasn't happened already.

606
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:06,769
I mean, you know, there's more than
one library in this city.

607
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:08,968
Not with cats on the front steps.

608
01:14:09,545 --> 01:14:12,480
Come on, Virginia, we gave it a shot.
It didn't pan out.

609
01:14:12,581 --> 01:14:15,709
We can't stake out every building in the city
with books inside...

610
01:14:15,818 --> 01:14:19,117
based on some cryptic passage
from a 30-year-old novel.

611
01:14:22,224 --> 01:14:24,852
Now go back to my apartment, all right?

612
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:26,721
We'll talk about it later.

613
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:28,789
Right, later.

614
01:14:31,533 --> 01:14:32,864
<i>Vámonos</i>, Richie.

615
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:34,898
You got some shit to shovel.

616
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:51,611
Channing, I want to talk to you. Now.

617
01:15:21,083 --> 01:15:22,175
"Librarian.

618
01:15:24,253 --> 01:15:26,414
"Love-starved swan.

619
01:15:30,659 --> 01:15:32,490
"Passionate lips.

620
01:15:36,865 --> 01:15:37,889
"Lions...

621
01:15:40,135 --> 01:15:41,329
"and cats."

622
01:15:48,443 --> 01:15:50,206
Get off the phone, Mona.

623
01:16:09,031 --> 01:16:11,693
Detective Channing's desk,
Detective Fishman speaking.

624
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:14,028
Hi, Virginia.

625
01:16:14,136 --> 01:16:16,627
No, he's in with the lieutenant right now.

626
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:18,406
Sure.

627
01:16:25,047 --> 01:16:27,538
Okay, I'll get it to him. 'Bye.

628
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,545
Fishman. Where you going?

629
01:16:33,655 --> 01:16:36,419
-Important message for Richard.
-Let me see that.

630
01:16:37,693 --> 01:16:39,888
Yes, Richie's nutty girlfriend.

631
01:16:39,995 --> 01:16:43,362
You won't be doing him
any favors by bringing this to him now.

632
01:17:57,105 --> 01:17:59,266
Mona, are you back there?

633
01:18:21,163 --> 01:18:22,824
Mona, I'm sorry.

634
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:39,777
I knew you'd come, Anna.

635
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:45,717
It's our wedding day.

636
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:11,377
No.

637
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:13,739
Somebody let me out of here!

638
01:20:40,368 --> 01:20:41,460
Leave me alone!

639
01:21:14,736 --> 01:21:15,998
Leave me alone!

640
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:52,430
Stay away from me.

641
01:21:56,011 --> 01:22:00,948
Finally your heart will be mine.

642
01:22:05,487 --> 01:22:06,454
Don't!

643
01:22:36,251 --> 01:22:38,219
Virginia, move away. Back away.

644
01:22:43,858 --> 01:22:45,325
You all right, baby?

645
01:22:46,661 --> 01:22:48,253
-Sweetheart?
-See?

646
01:23:16,891 --> 01:23:18,324
Son of a bitch!

647
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:52,289
<i>Head more canine than human.</i>
<i>A scrawny, growling, evil thing.</i>

648
01:23:52,394 --> 01:23:54,794
<i>Conceived much of madness, more of sin.</i>

649
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:57,430
<i>It lived, it lived!</i>
