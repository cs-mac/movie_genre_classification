1
00:00:03,708 --> 00:00:05,474
Sammy's hurt.
He's hurt real bad.

2
00:00:05,476 --> 00:00:08,210
This one goes out to any angel
with their ears on.

3
00:00:08,212 --> 00:00:13,082
This is Dean Winchester...
And I need your help.

4
00:00:13,084 --> 00:00:14,383
Start with a name.
Ezekiel.

5
00:00:14,385 --> 00:00:15,884
There is a chance I can fix
your brother.

6
00:00:15,886 --> 00:00:18,854
How will it work?
I heal Sam while healing myself.

7
00:00:18,856 --> 00:00:20,589
Sam can eject me
at any time.

8
00:00:20,894 --> 00:00:23,211
And if Sam does eject me,
he will die.

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,605
Then we keep it a secret
for now.

10
00:00:25,606 --> 00:00:27,356
I just got to hope that you're
one of the good guys.

11
00:00:27,358 --> 00:00:28,640
I am.

12
00:00:31,244 --> 00:00:32,478
Zeke!

13
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,497
You can bring her back
like you did with Cass.

14
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:39,034
I cannot keep doing that.
Why the hell not?!

15
00:00:39,036 --> 00:00:42,338
Every time I use my power,
it weakens me.

16
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:45,324
Merry Christmas.

17
00:00:45,326 --> 00:00:47,126
Dad wants us to pick up
where he left off --

18
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:49,111
saving people,
hunting things...

19
00:00:49,113 --> 00:00:50,162
The family business.

20
00:00:50,164 --> 00:00:52,014
<i>Becky, it's all real.</i>
I <i>knew</i> it!

21
00:00:52,016 --> 00:00:53,799
Nipples?

22
00:00:55,102 --> 00:00:57,169
I mean, come on.
We hunt monsters!

23
00:00:57,171 --> 00:00:59,505
Why am I here?!

24
00:00:59,507 --> 00:01:00,473
I mean, normal people,

25
00:01:00,475 --> 00:01:01,724
they see a monster,
and they run.

26
00:01:01,726 --> 00:01:03,008
But not us -- no, no, no.

27
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,144
We search out things
that want to kill us.

28
00:01:05,146 --> 00:01:07,346
Real. It's real.
No, no, no.

29
00:01:07,348 --> 00:01:08,864
Now you die.

30
00:01:08,866 --> 00:01:11,617
You know who does that?
Crazy people!

31
00:01:11,619 --> 00:01:12,618
I'm Batman.

32
00:01:13,571 --> 00:01:15,554
We...are insane!

33
00:01:15,556 --> 00:01:17,189
I lost my shoe.

34
00:01:19,877 --> 00:01:21,710
That was scary.

35
00:01:23,713 --> 00:01:27,333
<i>And with a 1:20 left</i>
<i>in the game, it's 62-54.</i>

36
00:01:27,335 --> 00:01:30,252
<i>This team wants</i>
<i>that championship.</i>

37
00:01:30,254 --> 00:01:31,587
<i>It would be great.</i>

38
00:01:31,589 --> 00:01:32,871
<i>He's up.</i>

39
00:01:32,873 --> 00:01:34,223
<i>It's good, but the ref's</i>
<i>on the whistle.</i>

40
00:01:34,225 --> 00:01:37,743
<i>He's calling a foul.</i>
<i>It could be charging.</i>

41
00:01:37,745 --> 00:01:40,012
<i>Number 10 --</i>
<i>he's not happy about that.</i>

42
00:01:40,014 --> 00:01:42,381
<i>This guy just about</i>
<i>could foul out,</i>

43
00:01:42,383 --> 00:01:44,683
<i>and nobody but the ref</i>
<i>wants to see that happen.</i>

44
00:01:44,685 --> 00:01:46,685
<i>Coach Johnson</i>
<i>watching the clock.</i>

45
00:01:46,687 --> 00:01:49,438
<i>He calls time-out.</i>

46
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,106
<i>Talking to the ref right now.</i>

47
00:01:51,108 --> 00:01:52,274
<i>You know, so far in this game,</i>

48
00:01:52,276 --> 00:01:54,059
<i>there have been</i>
<i>a number of fouls called</i>

49
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:55,995
<i>by this particular ref,</i>
<i>and that's not...</i>

50
00:02:00,234 --> 00:02:02,835
Easy, Colonel.

51
00:02:25,258 --> 00:02:27,610
Is anyone here?

52
00:02:38,538 --> 00:02:39,905
Whoa!

53
00:02:45,495 --> 00:02:48,163
Gets me every time.

54
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,805
What's the matter, boy?
It's me.

55
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:07,233
What the hell?

56
00:03:26,028 --> 00:03:30,028

Wow.

59
00:03:37,915 --> 00:03:39,414
What?

60
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:40,582
Kevin.

61
00:03:40,584 --> 00:03:43,485
Just poured some buffalo milk
down his gob twice.

62
00:03:43,487 --> 00:03:44,786
Buffalo milk?

63
00:03:44,788 --> 00:03:46,171
Yeah,
the hangover cure-all.

64
00:03:46,173 --> 00:03:48,924
It's got everything in it.
Except buffalo milk.

65
00:03:48,926 --> 00:03:51,643
How is that kid still recovering
from Branson?

66
00:03:51,645 --> 00:03:53,462
What can I say?
He's an amateur.

67
00:03:53,464 --> 00:03:56,482
The slippery nipple shots at
the Dolly Parton Dixie Stampede

68
00:03:56,484 --> 00:03:57,716
nearly killed the guy.

69
00:03:57,718 --> 00:03:58,817
All right.

70
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:00,352
Well, uh,
I got something

71
00:04:00,354 --> 00:04:02,070
that's gonna get us
back on the road.

72
00:04:03,056 --> 00:04:04,239
A case?
Yeah.

73
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:05,441
You sure
you're ready for that?

74
00:04:05,442 --> 00:04:09,060
Why would I not be ready
for that?

75
00:04:09,062 --> 00:04:11,747
Aren't you kind of running
on empty?

76
00:04:11,749 --> 00:04:13,532
Yeah, but the last
three nights straight,

77
00:04:13,534 --> 00:04:14,917
I had eight hours
of shut-eye.

78
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,418
And for a hunter,
that's like 20.

79
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,170
Trust me, Dean.
I feel good.

80
00:04:18,172 --> 00:04:19,705
Well, that's great and all,
James Brown,

81
00:04:19,707 --> 00:04:21,290
but you're still recovering
from the trials.

82
00:04:21,292 --> 00:04:23,292
I think you ought to pace
yourself, you know?

83
00:04:23,294 --> 00:04:25,544
And the sooner
you heal...

84
00:04:27,463 --> 00:04:28,580
Yeah?

85
00:04:28,582 --> 00:04:30,799
I just want you
back to your old self.

86
00:04:30,801 --> 00:04:31,850
I am, Dean.

87
00:04:31,852 --> 00:04:33,218
Look, Kevin's back
on the heaven spell.

88
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,269
Crowley's locked up.

89
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:35,921
We should be out there
doing what we do best.

90
00:04:35,923 --> 00:04:38,190
Well...
You want to listen at least?

91
00:04:38,192 --> 00:04:39,107
Okay, great.

92
00:04:39,109 --> 00:04:41,143
Taxidermist
named Max Alexander

93
00:04:41,145 --> 00:04:42,444
mysteriously crushed
to death.

94
00:04:42,446 --> 00:04:44,646
Nearly every joint in his body
dislocated,

95
00:04:44,648 --> 00:04:45,614
every bone broken.

96
00:04:45,616 --> 00:04:47,366
Poor guy is
a human pretzel.

97
00:04:47,368 --> 00:04:49,735
You tell me what's got
that kind of strength.

98
00:04:49,737 --> 00:04:51,102
A demonic Luchador?

99
00:04:51,104 --> 00:04:53,906
Shop's a couple hours away
in Enid, Oklahoma.

100
00:04:53,908 --> 00:04:55,490
We should at least
check it out.

101
00:04:55,492 --> 00:04:58,293
Unless there's some reason
you think we shouldn't.

102
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,470
Subtle.

103
00:05:08,472 --> 00:05:11,139
Check that out.

104
00:05:11,141 --> 00:05:13,175
Huh.

105
00:05:21,467 --> 00:05:24,186
Well, the creep factor
just skyrocketed.

106
00:05:24,188 --> 00:05:25,737
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

107
00:05:25,739 --> 00:05:28,640
How are you?
Agents Michaels and Deville.

108
00:05:29,993 --> 00:05:31,577
The body's already been
to the morgue.

109
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:33,996
Just wrapping it up
with Dave Stephens.

110
00:05:33,998 --> 00:05:35,781
He's the one
who discovered the body.

111
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,451
Such a shame.
I used to go hunting with Max.

112
00:05:39,453 --> 00:05:40,752
He was a real good egg.

113
00:05:40,754 --> 00:05:42,170
Sorry for your loss.
Thanks.

114
00:05:42,172 --> 00:05:43,672
You mind showing my partner
around?

115
00:05:43,674 --> 00:05:45,374
I just got a couple questions
for Mr. Stephens.

116
00:05:45,376 --> 00:05:47,376
Okay. Come on.

117
00:05:49,161 --> 00:05:51,496
Dave Stephens?
Yeah.

118
00:05:51,498 --> 00:05:53,131
I just got a couple questions
for you

119
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:54,216
if that's all right.

120
00:05:54,218 --> 00:05:56,001
I'll tell you
whatever you need to know.

121
00:05:56,003 --> 00:06:00,022
Max was a...a real pal.

122
00:06:00,024 --> 00:06:01,690
Hunting buddy?

123
00:06:01,692 --> 00:06:03,942
Mm. Yeah.

124
00:06:03,944 --> 00:06:06,061
Eh, lucky guess.

125
00:06:06,063 --> 00:06:09,114
So, uh, about what time
did you discover the body?

126
00:06:09,116 --> 00:06:12,784
About 9:00 a.m. --
my usual pickup time.

127
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:15,404
I come in every Wednesday
and Sundays,

128
00:06:15,406 --> 00:06:17,355
uh, to collect
the entrails.

129
00:06:17,357 --> 00:06:19,157
The what?

130
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:21,326
The animal organs.

131
00:06:21,328 --> 00:06:22,544
Ah.

132
00:06:22,546 --> 00:06:26,331
After Max would, uh,
dig them out and work his magic.

133
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,833
Huh.

134
00:06:27,835 --> 00:06:30,886
He, uh -- he was
a real artist, you know?

135
00:06:30,888 --> 00:06:35,390
Strange thing is, though, uh,
bins were empty this morning.

136
00:06:35,392 --> 00:06:37,426
Why is that strange?

137
00:06:37,428 --> 00:06:39,177
Well,
because it's a Sunday.

138
00:06:39,179 --> 00:06:41,463
Weekend hunts
are pretty much a given

139
00:06:41,465 --> 00:06:43,682
in this neck of the woods,

140
00:06:43,684 --> 00:06:45,317
so they're usually, mm,
chock-full of guts.

141
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:47,436
Ah.
Mm.

142
00:06:47,438 --> 00:06:49,321
Any chance Max could have
cleaned them out himself?

143
00:06:49,323 --> 00:06:51,222
No. It's a --
it's a biohazard.

144
00:06:51,224 --> 00:06:53,859
You can't just, you know,
throw the stuff out.

145
00:06:53,861 --> 00:06:55,360
You got to burn it.

146
00:06:55,362 --> 00:06:57,829
Huh.

147
00:06:57,831 --> 00:06:59,748
Is there, uh, anything else
missing from the shop?

148
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,118
No. The register was full,
and the safe was intact.

149
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,088
And all of Max's trophies
were still on the walls.

150
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,924
And was there anybody else here
when you showed up?

151
00:07:08,926 --> 00:07:11,126
No one.

152
00:07:11,128 --> 00:07:16,131
No, other than, uh...
The Colonel.

153
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:18,917
Hmm.

154
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:21,853
Excuse us.

155
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,272
So?
Okay, so, uh...

156
00:07:24,274 --> 00:07:27,025
We got a thief
who's jonesing for animal parts,

157
00:07:27,027 --> 00:07:29,561
we got a pagan symbol,
and we got a human pretzel.

158
00:07:29,563 --> 00:07:31,279
Yeah, it all sounds
very witch-y,

159
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:32,931
but I wasn't
able to find a hex bag.

160
00:07:32,933 --> 00:07:35,217
All right,
well, let's keep digging.

161
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:37,369
But, uh, not here.

162
00:07:37,371 --> 00:07:40,706
I don't like the way
that one's looking at me.

163
00:07:48,998 --> 00:07:53,118
Okay, uh, that...symbol
in the graffiti,

164
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,586
it's...not wiccan.

165
00:07:54,588 --> 00:07:57,055
It's copywritten.

166
00:07:57,057 --> 00:08:01,810
Local animal-rights group,
Enid's answer to PETA.

167
00:08:01,812 --> 00:08:04,346
S.N.A.R.T.?

168
00:08:04,348 --> 00:08:05,881
You got to be kidding me.

169
00:08:05,883 --> 00:08:08,133
Well, it makes sense
that an animal-rights group

170
00:08:08,135 --> 00:08:09,951
would have an axe to grind
with a taxidermist.

171
00:08:09,953 --> 00:08:13,155
Why?
The animal's already dead.

172
00:08:13,157 --> 00:08:15,107
Yeah, but hunters
are what keep them in business.

173
00:08:15,109 --> 00:08:18,076
Now the question is,
are those bleeding hearts

174
00:08:18,078 --> 00:08:21,479
actually witches
or just hippies?

175
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:25,083
What's the difference?

176
00:08:28,988 --> 00:08:31,489
Always knew I'd find
the source of all evil

177
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:33,158
at a vegan bakery.

178
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,327
What's that smell?

179
00:08:36,329 --> 00:08:37,596
Patchouli.

180
00:08:37,598 --> 00:08:41,499
Yeah, mixed with depression
from meat deprivation.

181
00:08:41,501 --> 00:08:42,801
Hey.

182
00:08:42,803 --> 00:08:45,270
You know who wears sunglasses
inside?

183
00:08:45,272 --> 00:08:46,721
Blind people.

184
00:08:46,723 --> 00:08:48,774
And douchebags.

185
00:08:54,346 --> 00:08:57,365
Olivia
and Dylan Camrose?

186
00:08:57,367 --> 00:08:59,117
At your service.

187
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:00,819
You two are members
of s.N.A.R.T.?

188
00:09:00,821 --> 00:09:03,688
Founders and co-presidents,
actually.

189
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,625
Uh, can we interest you
in some literature?

190
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,860
Or a flaxseed scone?

191
00:09:08,862 --> 00:09:10,879
It's wheat-free,
gluten-free, sugar-free,

192
00:09:10,881 --> 00:09:12,130
and surprisingly moist.

193
00:09:12,132 --> 00:09:13,548
Let me stop you
right there.

194
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:18,587
Uh, we're here to investigate
the death of Max Alexander,

195
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:20,005
a local taxidermist.

196
00:09:20,007 --> 00:09:21,890
He's...dead?

197
00:09:21,892 --> 00:09:22,891
You knew him?

198
00:09:22,893 --> 00:09:26,511
Ish. Um...small town.

199
00:09:26,513 --> 00:09:28,480
Well, he was murdered
last night,

200
00:09:28,482 --> 00:09:30,232
and a S.N.A.R.T. logo was found
at the crime scene.

201
00:09:30,234 --> 00:09:31,766
You two wouldn't happen
to know

202
00:09:31,768 --> 00:09:33,518
anything about that,
would you?

203
00:09:36,405 --> 00:09:38,890
His business is funded
by hunters,

204
00:09:38,892 --> 00:09:41,526
and you know
how hunters are.

205
00:09:41,528 --> 00:09:42,577
They're selfish dicks

206
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:44,746
who define themselves
by what they kill.

207
00:09:44,748 --> 00:09:48,533
And as animal advocates,
we couldn't stand for that.

208
00:09:48,535 --> 00:09:50,902
So, you killed him?

209
00:09:50,904 --> 00:09:52,570
Of course not.

210
00:09:52,572 --> 00:09:54,956
S.N.A.R.T. doesn't tolerate
violence.

211
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,341
Huh.

212
00:09:56,343 --> 00:09:59,377
This coming from a couple
who spray-paints death threats.

213
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:01,746
It was a scare tactic.
We just wanted to spook him.

214
00:10:01,748 --> 00:10:04,082
Turns out we were the ones
who got spooked.

215
00:10:04,084 --> 00:10:05,550
What does that mean?

216
00:10:08,087 --> 00:10:11,923
Well, last night,
when we were tagging the joint,

217
00:10:11,925 --> 00:10:13,775
we heard this noise.
A hissing noise.

218
00:10:13,777 --> 00:10:15,610
It freaked us out,
so we ran out into the alley.

219
00:10:15,612 --> 00:10:18,613
But someone attacked us.
Sprayed us in the eyes with mace.

220
00:10:18,615 --> 00:10:19,648
And it's not like we could go
to the cops.

221
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,566
So, now we look
like total douchebags

222
00:10:21,568 --> 00:10:23,935
because we have to wear
our sunglasses inside.

223
00:10:36,466 --> 00:10:38,283
Necrosis?

224
00:10:38,285 --> 00:10:40,635
Premature death
of tissues --

225
00:10:40,637 --> 00:10:41,953
that's why their eyes
were all messed up.

226
00:10:41,955 --> 00:10:44,256
And it's not caused
by mace.

227
00:10:44,258 --> 00:10:45,924
All right.
What caused it?

228
00:10:45,926 --> 00:10:49,728
Right here. "Blunt force,
radiation, venom."

229
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:50,946
As in "snake"?

230
00:10:50,948 --> 00:10:52,647
The taxidermist
was constricted.

231
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:54,266
Olivia and Dylan
heard hissing,

232
00:10:54,268 --> 00:10:55,984
and they were sprayed
in the eyes.

233
00:10:55,986 --> 00:10:57,969
By venom.
By venom.

234
00:10:57,971 --> 00:11:00,272
Okay, so...
What are we talking here,

235
00:11:00,274 --> 00:11:02,640
some sort of a freaky-ass
snake monster?

236
00:11:02,642 --> 00:11:04,910
Maybe.

237
00:11:04,912 --> 00:11:10,481
The weird thing is snakes
either envenomate or constrict.

238
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:11,950
No snake does both.

239
00:11:11,952 --> 00:11:15,153
Correction --
freaky-ass mega-snake monster.

240
00:11:15,155 --> 00:11:18,373
It could be a Vetala.

241
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,075
Yeah, but they're not afraid
to sink their fangs in.

242
00:11:20,077 --> 00:11:22,160
Taxidermist was
bite-free.

243
00:11:22,162 --> 00:11:24,095
It doesn't really fit
the profile.

244
00:11:24,097 --> 00:11:25,630
Right. So...?

245
00:11:25,632 --> 00:11:29,668
So, call Kevin.
Have him look some stuff up.

246
00:11:40,846 --> 00:11:44,699
Aren't you early,
dude?

247
00:11:52,658 --> 00:11:54,359
Hmm.

248
00:13:05,197 --> 00:13:06,231
Dude!

249
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:09,167
You said you were from
a perfume company.

250
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,580
No! No, please!

251
00:13:38,255 --> 00:13:39,554
Claw marks.

252
00:13:39,556 --> 00:13:42,441
Yeah. The cops said
all the cats went missing.

253
00:13:42,443 --> 00:13:43,692
Right, so, yesterday,

254
00:13:43,694 --> 00:13:45,143
uh, we're dealing with
some sort of a snake monster.

255
00:13:45,145 --> 00:13:46,278
Today,
it's a killer kitty.

256
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,779
I don't know.

257
00:13:47,781 --> 00:13:49,097
Hey.

258
00:13:49,099 --> 00:13:51,733
Why does that mutt
look familiar?

259
00:13:56,923 --> 00:14:01,159
That was
the taxidermist's dog.

260
00:14:01,161 --> 00:14:03,662
So, he's been
at both crime scenes?

261
00:14:03,664 --> 00:14:05,714
Yeah.

262
00:14:05,716 --> 00:14:07,949
Maybe he's a suspect.

263
00:14:07,951 --> 00:14:11,336
You know may--

264
00:14:11,338 --> 00:14:13,422
Could be a skinwalker,
maybe a shapeshifter.

265
00:14:13,424 --> 00:14:17,342
Doesn't really look
like a monster to me.

266
00:14:17,344 --> 00:14:19,678
One way to find out.

267
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,431
Come here, boy.
Hey.

268
00:14:22,433 --> 00:14:24,299
This isn't gonna hurt
at all.

269
00:14:24,301 --> 00:14:27,652
Unless it hurts.

270
00:14:33,025 --> 00:14:35,477
Hmm.

271
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:38,480
I guess we can, uh,
rule out killer.

272
00:14:40,334 --> 00:14:43,985
Do you agents need
any further assistance?

273
00:14:45,488 --> 00:14:47,255
Officer, I think we're okay.
Thanks.

274
00:14:47,257 --> 00:14:49,341
All right,
well, let me know.

275
00:14:51,428 --> 00:14:56,381
Officer. Excuse me.
Uh, can I borrow your hat?

276
00:15:04,724 --> 00:15:08,009
Good luck
getting adopted.

277
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:15,550
Okay, so,
the Colonel's not a suspect.

278
00:15:15,552 --> 00:15:17,702
Yeah,
but he's a witness.

279
00:15:17,704 --> 00:15:20,705
Hey, boy.
You speak sign language?

280
00:15:20,707 --> 00:15:22,324
That's monkeys.

281
00:15:22,326 --> 00:15:23,875
Huh?

282
00:15:23,877 --> 00:15:26,044
You know what?
This is gonna sound crazy.

283
00:15:26,046 --> 00:15:27,362
I read this book once
about this guy

284
00:15:27,364 --> 00:15:29,364
who tried to teach his dog
to speak

285
00:15:29,366 --> 00:15:30,749
after it witnessed
a murder.

286
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:32,501
It worked?

287
00:15:32,503 --> 00:15:33,868
No.

288
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,554
But he wrote a book
about it?

289
00:15:35,556 --> 00:15:37,005
Yeah, well, he doesn't have
what we have.

290
00:15:37,007 --> 00:15:39,341
Kevin. Hey, it's me.

291
00:15:39,343 --> 00:15:41,176
How do we speak
to a dog?

292
00:15:41,178 --> 00:15:44,212
An Inuit spell.

293
00:15:44,214 --> 00:15:45,564
Yeah.

294
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:49,935
Who knew the, uh, Men of Letters
had its own Eskimo section?

295
00:15:49,937 --> 00:15:52,737
And it's supposed to let us
communicate with the Colonel?

296
00:15:52,739 --> 00:15:57,392
Yeah,
well...that's the plan.

297
00:15:57,394 --> 00:16:02,414
Kevin said it's like a sort of
a human/animal mind meld.

298
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,065
Meaning?
If it works,

299
00:16:04,067 --> 00:16:07,669
we should be able to read
the Colonel's thoughts.

300
00:16:10,173 --> 00:16:11,573
All right, I'll do it.

301
00:16:11,575 --> 00:16:13,074
You -- you got enough
on your plate.

302
00:16:13,076 --> 00:16:14,593
Like what?

303
00:16:16,213 --> 00:16:19,798
Uh, like...you're tired.

304
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,583
You're on the mend.
Okay?

305
00:16:21,585 --> 00:16:24,302
Plus, you -- you've got
a sensitive stomach.

306
00:16:24,304 --> 00:16:26,805
Last thing we need is
you chucking this stuff up. Huh?

307
00:16:28,258 --> 00:16:32,310
Doesn't look so bad.

308
00:16:37,767 --> 00:16:40,652
I was wrong.

309
00:16:40,654 --> 00:16:42,320
Come on.

310
00:16:45,826 --> 00:16:49,494
Ha!

311
00:16:50,631 --> 00:16:53,215
<i>"Deila hér me.</i>

312

313
00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:03,241
All right.
Let's get this party started.

314
00:17:03,243 --> 00:17:05,126
Tell me
everything you know.

315
00:17:07,531 --> 00:17:10,515
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

316
00:17:11,518 --> 00:17:14,653
Tough crowd.

317
00:17:22,144 --> 00:17:25,030
♪ <i>I got to take a little time</i> ♪

318
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:27,282
So, call Kevin.

♪ <i>A little time to think things over</i> ♪
spell tasted like ass and was a bust.

320
00:17:31,121 --> 00:17:33,321
At least it didn't affect

I think the spell worked.

So, apparently, the Inuit spell
has some side effects.

382
00:19:59,361 --> 00:20:00,744

What kind

00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:06,200
When you mind meld
with an animal,

386
00:20:06,202 --> 00:20:09,953
it's...possible to start
exhibiting some of its behavior.

Don't look at me, Hoss.
It ain't my fault.

Well, how long am I gonna have
the urge to...

389
00:20:18,431 --> 00:20:19,996

it's an exact science, you know?

397
00:20:36,515 --> 00:20:39,066
But hopefully,
when the spell wears off,

398
00:20:39,068 --> 00:20:42,202
so will the side effects.

399
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:45,923

maybe dig up
something we missed?

483
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:37,028
Over there.
Hi!

484
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:40,448
Ohh, a-a cowboy hat,
leather pants.

485
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:42,700
The dude's
a total closet case.

486
00:24:42,702 --> 00:24:44,735
Okay, what else can you tell me
about the guy

487
00:24:44,737 --> 00:24:46,003
other than his outfit?

488
00:24:46,005 --> 00:24:49,540
Um, he was carrying
a burlap sack for the cats.

489
00:24:49,542 --> 00:24:51,008
What does he want
with the cats?

490
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:53,010
Ooh, attaboy, yes.
Hell if I know.

491
00:24:53,012 --> 00:24:56,297
But he took all of them,
except for the one he ate.

492
00:24:56,299 --> 00:24:58,516
Ew.
What?

493
00:24:58,518 --> 00:25:02,520
Apparently, our guy has
a sweet tooth for kitty cats.

494
00:25:02,522 --> 00:25:03,938
Huh.

495
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,191
Oh. Oh, and the sack had
something written on it.

496
00:25:07,193 --> 00:25:09,193
Okay, what did it say?

497
00:25:11,481 --> 00:25:13,231
Hey, come on.
We had a deal.

498
00:25:13,233 --> 00:25:15,266
Well, you tell that
to the tall drink.

499
00:25:15,268 --> 00:25:17,434
He's the one
who stopped rubbing.

500
00:25:17,436 --> 00:25:18,569
Sam.

501
00:25:18,571 --> 00:25:19,603
Hand cramps.

502
00:25:19,605 --> 00:25:22,606
He's not talking.

503
00:25:22,608 --> 00:25:25,826
Attaboy.

504
00:25:25,828 --> 00:25:29,180
It said
"Avant-Garde Cuisine."

505
00:25:29,182 --> 00:25:32,049
Lucky for you,
I read French.

506
00:25:32,051 --> 00:25:34,252
That's a café
on Main Street.

507
00:25:34,254 --> 00:25:35,586
"No dogs allowed."

508
00:25:35,588 --> 00:25:38,756
Well, no wonder he smelled
like hamburgers and dish soap.

509
00:25:38,758 --> 00:25:40,007
We got to go downtown.

510
00:25:40,009 --> 00:25:42,126
Apparently our guy works
at a restaurant.

511
00:25:42,128 --> 00:25:44,295
Whoa-oh, yeah.

512
00:25:44,297 --> 00:25:47,515
No, no, wait, wait, wait.
Sure you don't want to adopt me?

513
00:25:47,517 --> 00:25:48,849
No, thanks.
Uh, we'll pass.

514
00:25:48,851 --> 00:25:50,968
No,
I'm not above licking feet.

515
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:52,820
Hey, big'un!
Come back here!

516
00:25:52,822 --> 00:25:54,105
All right.
Well...

517
00:25:54,107 --> 00:25:55,573
Hey, hold up.

518
00:25:55,575 --> 00:25:57,308
What's the matter?

519
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:01,946
Best belly rub I ever had.

520
00:26:04,199 --> 00:26:05,533
Freedom!

521
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,171
I left a surprise in there
for animal control.

522
00:26:10,173 --> 00:26:12,990
I didn't peg you
for a softy.

523
00:26:12,992 --> 00:26:15,626
Going home. I'm going home.
Honey, I'm coming home.

524
00:26:15,628 --> 00:26:17,044
Yeah,
I'm coming home.

525
00:26:17,046 --> 00:26:18,346
I'm going home!

526
00:26:18,348 --> 00:26:19,463
Bacon! Bacon! Bacon!
Bacon!

527
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,690
I'm sorry.

528
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:49,293
Who can afford to be closed
on Monday these days?

529
00:26:49,295 --> 00:26:50,828
A homicidal maniac?

530
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,129
Yeah.

531
00:26:52,131 --> 00:26:53,831
Hey.

532
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:11,849
Check this out.
Chef Leo.

533
00:27:11,851 --> 00:27:13,184
Think he's our guy?

534
00:27:13,186 --> 00:27:15,102
It's Okie town.

535
00:27:15,104 --> 00:27:17,855
Lots of dudes
wear cowboy hats.

536
00:27:26,698 --> 00:27:28,282
Whoa.

537
00:27:28,284 --> 00:27:33,287
Oxycodone,
tramadol, methadone.

538
00:27:33,289 --> 00:27:35,506
Oh, guess he likes to cook
comfortably numb.

539
00:27:35,508 --> 00:27:37,041
Yeah, apparently.

540
00:27:37,043 --> 00:27:38,676
Help us.

541
00:27:38,678 --> 00:27:40,411
Please, mister.
Over here.

542
00:27:40,413 --> 00:27:41,712
Did you hear that?

543
00:27:43,548 --> 00:27:46,083
Sounded like little kids.

544
00:27:48,553 --> 00:27:51,389
Help. If you don't free us,
the chef will eat us.

545
00:27:51,391 --> 00:27:52,406
She's not lying.

546
00:27:52,408 --> 00:27:55,726
We're in a cage!

547
00:27:59,231 --> 00:28:00,664
Eat you?

548
00:28:00,666 --> 00:28:02,817
Look in the refrigerator
behind you.

549
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:05,536
Yeah, behind you.
In the fridge.

550
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,941
Hey.

551
00:28:10,943 --> 00:28:12,609
"Owl brains."

552
00:28:12,611 --> 00:28:13,961
"Cheetah liver."

553
00:28:13,963 --> 00:28:15,546
"Grizzly heart."

554
00:28:15,548 --> 00:28:20,000
Ah, a spell book.
Shamanism.

555
00:28:20,002 --> 00:28:22,670
Well, what's a chef doing
dabbling with witchcraft?

556
00:28:22,672 --> 00:28:24,221
It says here whatever
animal organ you ingest

557
00:28:24,223 --> 00:28:27,558
with the right mix
of hoo doo and spices,

558
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,960
you temporarily gain the power
of that animal.

559
00:28:29,962 --> 00:28:34,098
So, okay, if you're munching
on owl brains...

560
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,666
Your head spins around
like "The Exorcist"?

561
00:28:35,668 --> 00:28:38,302
Close.
Bolsters your IQ.

562
00:28:38,304 --> 00:28:42,173
Okay, eat a cheetah liver
for speed,

563
00:28:42,175 --> 00:28:44,024
bear heart
for strength.

564
00:28:44,026 --> 00:28:45,726
Okay, so if he's chowing down
on this stuff --

565
00:28:45,728 --> 00:28:46,677
Then it would make sense

566
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:48,178
why he constricted
the taxidermist

567
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,681
and clawed the guy
at the shelter.

568
00:28:50,683 --> 00:28:53,284
Well, no offense, but why would
he want to eat you guys?

569
00:28:53,286 --> 00:28:55,002
Uh, we have
collapsible spines.

570
00:28:55,004 --> 00:28:56,036
We do. Promise.

571
00:28:56,038 --> 00:28:57,688
Look at this.
Hmm?

572
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:59,189
"Lion liver plus
eagle heart.

573
00:28:59,191 --> 00:29:01,408
"Rattlesnake fangs plus
anaconda bladder.

574
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,494
Baboon brains plus
black widow abdomen."

575
00:29:03,496 --> 00:29:05,396
He's mixing ingredients.

576
00:29:05,398 --> 00:29:06,714
What the hell for?

577
00:29:08,468 --> 00:29:10,601
Shoo! Quiet!

578
00:29:10,603 --> 00:29:12,720
Don't shush me!
You be quiet!

579
00:29:12,722 --> 00:29:16,557
I am quite. Now.

580
00:29:35,577 --> 00:29:37,111
Who the hell are you?

581
00:29:37,113 --> 00:29:38,529
We're from
the health department.

582
00:29:38,531 --> 00:29:40,063
Stopped by
for an inspection.

583
00:29:40,065 --> 00:29:42,065
I wasn't aware
we had one scheduled.

584
00:29:42,067 --> 00:29:45,252
Yeah, no, you wouldn't be.
That's the point.

585
00:29:45,254 --> 00:29:47,004
Besides,
I thought you were closed.

586
00:29:47,006 --> 00:29:48,572
We are.
Chef's having a private dinner.

587
00:29:48,574 --> 00:29:51,842
In fact,
he'll be here any minute.

588
00:29:51,844 --> 00:29:54,795
Oh. Well, then. In that case,
kitchen's shut down.

589
00:29:54,797 --> 00:29:57,097
Shut down? Why?

590
00:29:57,099 --> 00:29:59,416
Because, uh, y-you're both
in clear violation

591
00:29:59,418 --> 00:30:01,235
of penal code 8.14.

592
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:07,024
Out. Come on. Get out.

593
00:30:07,026 --> 00:30:10,261
Both of you.
We'll let you know.

594
00:30:12,564 --> 00:30:13,614
All right.

595
00:30:13,616 --> 00:30:15,098
I'll take the front.
You take the back.

596
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,767
Do we even know
how to kill this guy?

597
00:30:16,769 --> 00:30:18,953
Well, empty one of these
in his head.

598
00:30:18,955 --> 00:30:20,704
See what that does.

599
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,657
Aah!

600
00:31:00,947 --> 00:31:03,313
Chameleons aren't
that bad.

601
00:31:03,315 --> 00:31:05,115
Kind of taste
like chicken.

602
00:31:30,292 --> 00:31:33,010
How the hell
did you do that?

603
00:31:33,012 --> 00:31:35,646
D-do what?

604
00:31:35,648 --> 00:31:38,565
Don't play coy.
I want to know what you are.

605
00:31:40,152 --> 00:31:43,687
Oh,
screw the sharktopus.

606
00:31:45,324 --> 00:31:47,458
You're my main course.

607
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:11,659
Why does it smell like dog
in here?

608
00:32:14,463 --> 00:32:17,899
That smell's coming
from you.

609
00:32:32,315 --> 00:32:35,683
All dogs
should be leashed.

610
00:32:44,726 --> 00:32:46,744
What did you do
to my brother?

611
00:32:48,497 --> 00:32:51,449
Your brother?

612
00:32:51,451 --> 00:32:53,501
What was your mom smoking
when she had you two?

613
00:32:53,503 --> 00:32:55,286
He's fine.

614
00:32:55,288 --> 00:32:57,588
He's just taking
a little cat nap before dinner.

615
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,457
I've never had human heart
before.

616
00:32:59,459 --> 00:33:00,558
Heard it's a bit chewy.

617
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,593
Good job
I'm not a fussy eater.

618
00:33:05,681 --> 00:33:06,964
You're sick.

619
00:33:06,966 --> 00:33:09,717
Been told that
once or twice.

620
00:33:09,719 --> 00:33:11,886
No, no.
Not in the head.

621
00:33:11,888 --> 00:33:14,355
I, uh -- well,
you are that, too,

622
00:33:14,357 --> 00:33:18,092
but I mean
sick like cancer.

623
00:33:20,595 --> 00:33:24,098
Well, I guess dogs really can
sniff it out.

624
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:27,601
Stage IV carcinoma.

625
00:33:27,603 --> 00:33:28,786
Huh.

626
00:33:28,788 --> 00:33:30,621
So that's why
you're doing this.

627
00:33:30,623 --> 00:33:32,657
What happened?

628
00:33:32,659 --> 00:33:35,877
Draw the short straw,
decided to break bad?

629
00:33:35,879 --> 00:33:37,378
See,
when I was diagnosed,

630
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,114
I was way past
standard treatment.

631
00:33:40,116 --> 00:33:41,949
No one could save me.

632
00:33:41,951 --> 00:33:44,285
But then with the help
of a Pawnee shaman

633
00:33:44,287 --> 00:33:47,171
and a zoo membership,
I found a cure,

634
00:33:47,173 --> 00:33:50,174
albeit a temporary one.

635
00:33:50,176 --> 00:33:52,477
Cancer always came back.

636
00:33:54,114 --> 00:33:56,647
You start experimenting
with different organs, huh?

637
00:33:56,649 --> 00:34:00,151
Traded in the single serving
for a combo platter.

638
00:34:00,153 --> 00:34:03,154
Well, what can I say?
Combination therapy works.

639
00:34:03,156 --> 00:34:05,139
I felt stronger,

640
00:34:05,141 --> 00:34:09,026
and the effects
lasted longer.

641
00:34:09,028 --> 00:34:12,530
And if you smoke a few innocent
people in the process,

642
00:34:12,532 --> 00:34:15,616
well, hell,
at least you felt better.

643
00:34:15,618 --> 00:34:19,754
Well, I didn't mean
to kill anyone -- at first.

644
00:34:19,756 --> 00:34:25,760
But if people got in my way,
they became collateral damage.

645
00:34:25,762 --> 00:34:30,097
Guess you eat enough predators,
you start to become one.

646
00:34:30,099 --> 00:34:33,851
You are what you eat,
right?

647
00:34:35,004 --> 00:34:36,387
Do you really think
the power you hold

648
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:38,005
over other people's lives

649
00:34:38,007 --> 00:34:40,725
can make up for what you lack
in your own?

650
00:34:46,064 --> 00:34:49,200
So, dog boy,

651
00:34:49,202 --> 00:34:53,237
what do I need to eat
to take you down, huh?

652
00:34:56,325 --> 00:34:59,794
You don't
want to do this.

653
00:34:59,796 --> 00:35:02,163
Oh, but I do
want to do this.

654
00:35:03,865 --> 00:35:07,718
See, I'm gonna kill you,
work up a nice appetite,

655
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,889
and then I'm gonna eat
your brother.

656
00:35:13,259 --> 00:35:16,811
I mean, I don't know
what the hell he is,

657
00:35:16,813 --> 00:35:21,816
but with healing powers
like that, who cares?

658
00:35:23,068 --> 00:35:25,653
He could cure me.

659
00:35:28,357 --> 00:35:30,107
Ah.

660
00:35:32,027 --> 00:35:35,530
Dog on sort-of dog.

661
00:35:43,121 --> 00:35:44,922
<i>Rahuraar,</i>

662
00:35:44,924 --> 00:35:50,744
<i>sakuriisat iisat</i>
<i>a ti'pah kaawakit.</i>

663
00:35:50,746 --> 00:35:53,047
<i>'A tarahkista'u...</i>

664
00:35:54,299 --> 00:35:57,385
<i>...a raah.</i>

665
00:36:23,246 --> 00:36:27,265
Sorry.
Wolf trumps dog.

666
00:36:27,267 --> 00:36:30,101
Maybe.
But not a whole pack.

667
00:37:12,549 --> 00:37:13,999
Hey.

668
00:37:14,001 --> 00:37:17,186
For the love of God,
Sammy.

669
00:37:17,188 --> 00:37:18,638
Hey, Sammy.

670
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,525
Zeke.

671
00:37:22,527 --> 00:37:24,026
Whoever the hell
you are.

672
00:37:24,028 --> 00:37:26,279
Hey. Come on.

673
00:37:26,281 --> 00:37:30,816
Don't make me lick
your damn face.

674
00:37:30,818 --> 00:37:31,817
Hey.

675
00:37:40,494 --> 00:37:43,579
Come on.

676
00:37:43,581 --> 00:37:45,631
When you called us
about adopting him,

677
00:37:45,633 --> 00:37:46,865
we couldn't
believe it.

678
00:37:46,867 --> 00:37:48,634
Aren't you
the sweetest?

679
00:37:48,636 --> 00:37:50,002
Ugh.
Back off, tofu-breath.

680
00:37:50,004 --> 00:37:52,871
Oh,
you must be starving.

681
00:37:52,873 --> 00:37:56,759
Lucky for you, I baked
some vegan doggy cupcakes.

682
00:38:02,183 --> 00:38:05,351
I'm gonna be pooping wheatgrass
with these two.

683
00:38:06,387 --> 00:38:07,886
Look, I know
they're hippie freaks,

684
00:38:07,888 --> 00:38:09,188
but they're gonna give you
a good home --

685
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,389
one that you deserve.

686
00:38:10,391 --> 00:38:12,325
Yeah, yeah.

687
00:38:12,327 --> 00:38:15,027
Wish we could take you
on the road with us,

688
00:38:15,029 --> 00:38:17,847
but it's no life
for a dog.

689
00:38:17,849 --> 00:38:20,499
Don't sweat it.
I get carsick anyway.

690
00:38:20,501 --> 00:38:22,668
I was afraid to tell you
earlier,

691
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,120
but I barfed
in your backseat.

692
00:38:24,122 --> 00:38:26,372
You...

693
00:38:26,374 --> 00:38:28,257
What?

694
00:38:31,596 --> 00:38:33,078
I'm gonna miss you,
buddy.

695
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,964
I'll miss you, too.

696
00:38:34,966 --> 00:38:37,350
And by the way,
as an honorary dog,

697
00:38:37,352 --> 00:38:39,084
there's something
you should know.

698
00:38:39,086 --> 00:38:41,554
Dog's aren't really
man's best friend.

699
00:38:41,556 --> 00:38:43,472
What are you
talking about?

700
00:38:43,474 --> 00:38:45,558
I know it sounds
like a conspiracy theory,

701
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,777
but the real reason
we were put here was to...

702
00:38:50,148 --> 00:38:52,948
Put here to do what?

703
00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:57,620
Oh, you got to be
kidding me.

704
00:38:57,622 --> 00:38:59,989
Oh, <i>now</i> the spell
wears off?!

705
00:39:05,712 --> 00:39:07,713
Okay.

706
00:39:13,687 --> 00:39:15,655
How did it go?

707
00:39:15,657 --> 00:39:19,842
Well, bad news is
I'm gonna miss the flea bag.

708
00:39:19,844 --> 00:39:21,394
Good news is

709
00:39:21,396 --> 00:39:23,796
it looks like the spell
is finally wearing off.

710
00:39:25,165 --> 00:39:27,350
You okay?

711
00:39:27,352 --> 00:39:30,135
The Stetson man
got you pretty good.

712
00:39:30,137 --> 00:39:31,237
Yeah, I'm fine.

713
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:33,972
I-I just, uh...

714
00:39:33,974 --> 00:39:36,308
I can't stop thinking
about what he said.

715
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,777
Oh, come on, Sammy.

716
00:39:37,779 --> 00:39:39,745
Guy was out of
his freaking gourd.

717
00:39:39,747 --> 00:39:44,250
Yeah, but, I mean,
why -- why would he ask that?

718
00:39:44,252 --> 00:39:46,285
Why -- why did he want to know
what I was?

719
00:39:46,287 --> 00:39:49,121
Who the hell knows?

720
00:39:49,123 --> 00:39:51,424
He was all jacked up
on juice, you know?

721
00:39:51,426 --> 00:39:53,959
He was possessed by -- by
something he couldn't control.

722
00:39:53,961 --> 00:39:56,162
It was...

723
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,002
It was just
a matter of time

724
00:40:03,004 --> 00:40:05,938
before it
completely took over.

725
00:40:07,841 --> 00:40:11,343
You can't reason with crazy,
right?

726
00:40:11,345 --> 00:40:13,846
I don't know.

727
00:40:13,848 --> 00:40:15,981
Well, I do.

728
00:40:15,983 --> 00:40:18,684
Trust me, Sam.
You got nothing to worry about.

729
00:40:34,108 --> 00:40:39,108
