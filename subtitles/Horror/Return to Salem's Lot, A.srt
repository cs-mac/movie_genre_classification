1
00:00:01,156 --> 00:00:02,689
Previously on "Salem"...

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:04,031
Fornicator!

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:06,893
He searches.

4
00:00:08,596 --> 00:00:10,989
So where is the witch?

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,299
Right here.

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,600
Aaah!

7
00:00:14,069 --> 00:00:15,504
If he cannot be stopped,

8
00:00:15,505 --> 00:00:19,674
well, then it's an
entirely new game, isn't it?

9
00:00:19,675 --> 00:00:24,646
Everything your father
does, he does for you.

10
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:29,450
I no longer want to be your customer.

11
00:00:29,451 --> 00:00:32,487
True love cannot be bought or sold.

12
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:34,055
Let's just live.

13
00:00:34,056 --> 00:00:36,091
You still love John Alden.

14
00:00:36,092 --> 00:00:40,595
The grand rite ferments
best in a loveless heart.

15
00:00:40,596 --> 00:00:42,931
He serves at my behest.

16
00:00:42,932 --> 00:00:46,034
He won't come out for you.

17
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,538
Father.

18
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:51,106
My dear Increase.

19
00:00:51,107 --> 00:00:54,009
How long may we enjoy
your presence in town?

20
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,246
Until every last Devil's whore of a witch

21
00:00:57,247 --> 00:01:00,982
in Salem is dead.

22
00:01:04,053 --> 00:01:05,520
Depravity.

23
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:07,055
Can there be a more apt word

24
00:01:07,056 --> 00:01:09,891
to describe the current
state of your fair city?

25
00:01:09,892 --> 00:01:11,125
Drink, perversity,

26
00:01:11,126 --> 00:01:13,795
abominations of each and every variety

27
00:01:13,796 --> 00:01:15,230
offered and received.

28
00:01:15,231 --> 00:01:18,133
And even as we cater to our inner demons,

29
00:01:18,134 --> 00:01:21,169
we have allowed actual demons to flourish!

30
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,838
Witches!

31
00:01:22,839 --> 00:01:24,473
He was not supposed to be here.

32
00:01:24,474 --> 00:01:26,107
Living vessels of godlessness.

33
00:01:26,108 --> 00:01:27,042
So why is he?

34
00:01:27,043 --> 00:01:28,477
The serpent from eden...

35
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:30,445
He came to see what his
son had accomplished.

36
00:01:30,446 --> 00:01:31,546
You have listened and...

37
00:01:31,547 --> 00:01:33,782
And why is he staying?

38
00:01:33,783 --> 00:01:36,918
He saw what his son had accomplished.

39
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,488
There are witches hidden amongst us,

40
00:01:39,489 --> 00:01:41,456
and you people of Salem,

41
00:01:41,457 --> 00:01:45,661
seduced by drink and by flesh,

42
00:01:45,662 --> 00:01:47,628
are happily blinded to it.

43
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:48,963
Standing before you,

44
00:01:48,964 --> 00:01:51,500
with the certainty of the rising sun,

45
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:55,737
I assure you this will change.

46
00:01:55,738 --> 00:01:58,273
Mrs. Sibley.

47
00:01:58,274 --> 00:02:02,677
Reverend, your words are inspiration.

48
00:02:02,678 --> 00:02:04,178
England's loss is our gain.

49
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:07,382
I trust your husband's
condition is improving.

50
00:02:07,383 --> 00:02:08,449
Sadly, no.

51
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,619
Well, please tell George

52
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,688
I shall visit him again at once.

53
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:16,124
Perhaps my presence may
be of some comfort to him.

54
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,992
Oh, how could it not?

55
00:02:34,076 --> 00:02:35,376
I have no words.

56
00:02:36,612 --> 00:02:39,180
Like a man who's seen the face of God.

57
00:02:40,716 --> 00:02:44,052
Only an awed silence is
the appropriate response.

58
00:02:51,394 --> 00:02:52,561
Your father.

59
00:02:52,562 --> 00:02:55,029
And like that, the mood is ruined.

60
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,798
No, your... your father.

61
00:02:56,799 --> 00:02:58,132
He's... he's in the common.

62
00:02:58,133 --> 00:03:01,302
With a crowd, no doubt,
hanging on his every word.

63
00:03:01,303 --> 00:03:04,372
With a crowd, yes, but he's not speaking.

64
00:03:04,373 --> 00:03:07,175
Well, then you must have him
confused with someone else.

65
00:03:08,077 --> 00:03:10,345
He's walking this way.

66
00:03:10,346 --> 00:03:12,147
And by "this way," you mean...

67
00:03:15,651 --> 00:03:19,520
He cannot find me here.

68
00:03:25,394 --> 00:03:28,029
And where better to begin
our cleansing of Salem

69
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,130
than in its most vile den?

70
00:03:29,131 --> 00:03:30,766
The back stairs.

71
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:32,500
No, no, no, no, y-you'll
cross the landing.

72
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:34,135
Gloriana, my father does not understand me.

73
00:03:34,136 --> 00:03:35,403
He never has.

74
00:03:35,404 --> 00:03:37,038
- If he discovers me...
- Under the bed now.

75
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:40,041
- What?!
- Under the bed now!

76
00:03:49,785 --> 00:03:51,152
Where's my Bible?

77
00:03:51,153 --> 00:03:53,354
I-I-I don't
see it!

78
00:03:58,327 --> 00:04:01,062
Oh.

79
00:04:01,063 --> 00:04:02,964
Reverend Mather.

80
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:05,733
You know me?

81
00:04:05,734 --> 00:04:08,069
Is there anyone in the
province who doesn't?

82
00:04:15,545 --> 00:04:17,278
You are alone?

83
00:04:18,648 --> 00:04:21,149
No.

84
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,653
I'm here with my lord.

85
00:04:24,654 --> 00:04:27,722
His words, anyway.

86
00:04:27,723 --> 00:04:32,360
They offer great comfort
in these perilous times...

87
00:04:32,361 --> 00:04:34,362
Even for a woman like me.

88
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:50,979
Do you not sense it?

89
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:55,884
The commingling of sin and sorcery?

90
00:04:55,885 --> 00:04:58,720
Take a breath.

91
00:05:00,256 --> 00:05:02,957
You can almost taste it...

92
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,160
Satan's toxic nectar,

93
00:05:05,161 --> 00:05:10,431
designed to divert and disarm.

94
00:05:20,542 --> 00:05:22,777
Ah.

95
00:05:24,514 --> 00:05:28,282
The proprietress of this
charming establishment.

96
00:05:28,283 --> 00:05:30,919
What'll it be today, Reverend?

97
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,553
Thin and pliant,

98
00:05:32,554 --> 00:05:35,290
or thick and playful?

99
00:05:41,563 --> 00:05:43,832
Mind your betters, madam.

100
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:48,469
I run an honest house.
You'll find nothing here.

101
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,504
I have made my name finding things

102
00:05:50,505 --> 00:05:54,275
where there is nothing to be found.

103
00:06:06,756 --> 00:06:09,190
Orris root?

104
00:06:09,191 --> 00:06:12,727
Strangers tramp in and
out of here every day.

105
00:06:12,728 --> 00:06:16,965
I do not know what substances they carry.

106
00:06:36,619 --> 00:06:38,919
Hmm.

107
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,670
Casting stones.

108
00:06:58,373 --> 00:07:01,576
Selectmen of Salem...

109
00:07:01,577 --> 00:07:04,946
We've uncovered a witch.

110
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,992

www.addic7ed.com

111
00:07:53,395 --> 00:07:55,329
One of ours.

112
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,732
Exactly what we feared the
minute he stepped off that ship.

113
00:07:57,733 --> 00:08:00,134
Now, well, you know what this means.

114
00:08:00,135 --> 00:08:02,203
Just because I don't share your panic

115
00:08:02,204 --> 00:08:03,538
doesn't mean I don't grasp the stakes.

116
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:05,473
He will press her for names,

117
00:08:05,474 --> 00:08:07,541
and whose will be she tempted to provide?

118
00:08:07,542 --> 00:08:08,642
She was careless,

119
00:08:08,643 --> 00:08:10,811
leaving objects of her
craft so close at hand.

120
00:08:10,812 --> 00:08:13,481
And for that carelessness, we may all burn,

121
00:08:13,482 --> 00:08:15,116
to say nothing of what will
become of our grand rite.

122
00:08:15,117 --> 00:08:18,119
Your hysteria offers no solutions.

123
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,089
Mab simply needs to be reminded
what is expected of her.

124
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,790
Her silence.

125
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,459
You're right.

126
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,261
I shall pay her a visit at once.

127
00:08:30,532 --> 00:08:32,033
You're worried.

128
00:08:32,034 --> 00:08:34,802
He is formidable, the senior Mather,

129
00:08:34,803 --> 00:08:38,172
part bully, part bloodhound.

130
00:08:38,173 --> 00:08:41,775
Mab has been loyal to the hive throughout.

131
00:08:41,776 --> 00:08:44,312
It is not Mab that worries me.

132
00:08:44,313 --> 00:08:47,315
Increase promises to pay another visit.

133
00:08:47,316 --> 00:08:49,317
How long before he realizes

134
00:08:49,318 --> 00:08:51,419
that George is not sick, but spelled?

135
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,721
And at whose hands? Mine.

136
00:08:53,722 --> 00:08:55,623
Then prevent this.

137
00:08:55,624 --> 00:08:57,726
Yes.

138
00:08:59,028 --> 00:09:01,262
Increase may visit at his pleasure,

139
00:09:01,263 --> 00:09:04,765
for what loving wife would
leave her ailing husband at home

140
00:09:04,766 --> 00:09:07,835
when his condition
demands attention at once?

141
00:09:23,718 --> 00:09:25,586
You're drinking early today.

142
00:09:25,587 --> 00:09:26,820
If you knew my father,

143
00:09:26,821 --> 00:09:28,489
you'd commend me for waiting this long.

144
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,925
You know, the way you speak
of him, you make him sound...

145
00:09:30,926 --> 00:09:32,193
Inhuman?

146
00:09:32,194 --> 00:09:34,262
- Yes.
- Good.

147
00:09:34,263 --> 00:09:37,631
Then I have painted an accurate picture.

148
00:09:37,632 --> 00:09:41,336
Don't believe me? See for yourself.

149
00:09:42,704 --> 00:09:46,107
Cotton, I've been in
search of you all morning.

150
00:09:46,108 --> 00:09:48,309
I supposed I should have realized

151
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:51,445
you would be somewhere
where whiskey is served.

152
00:09:52,414 --> 00:09:53,581
Father, this is John...

153
00:09:53,582 --> 00:09:54,749
John Alden.

154
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,652
Your father and I were
classmates at university.

155
00:09:58,653 --> 00:10:00,087
Yes, I know.

156
00:10:00,088 --> 00:10:02,190
An honor, Captain.

157
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:04,725
Truly, I can have no greater respect

158
00:10:04,726 --> 00:10:07,795
than for a man who has
risked his life in battle.

159
00:10:07,796 --> 00:10:12,967
Sadly, not all young men
possess the same mettle.

160
00:10:12,968 --> 00:10:15,436
What brings you, father?

161
00:10:15,437 --> 00:10:17,805
Well, I am shocked to discover

162
00:10:17,806 --> 00:10:21,275
the extent of the depravity
and immorality in Salem.

163
00:10:21,276 --> 00:10:25,280
The people need a reminder
of the wages of their sin.

164
00:10:25,281 --> 00:10:26,914
And so they will get one.

165
00:10:26,915 --> 00:10:29,250
Mm-hmm. - In
Sunday's sermon.

166
00:10:29,251 --> 00:10:31,152
No. No.

167
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:36,825
They need to hear your voice now.

168
00:10:36,826 --> 00:10:39,527
A public recitation on the commons,

169
00:10:39,528 --> 00:10:42,162
illustrated by the face of sin.

170
00:10:42,163 --> 00:10:45,099
The face of sin?

171
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,002
And who is that?

172
00:10:49,704 --> 00:10:52,673
And Cotton?

173
00:10:52,674 --> 00:10:54,943
Your Bible.

174
00:11:24,803 --> 00:11:28,305
The hospital in Boston awaits him.

175
00:11:28,306 --> 00:11:30,407
It is my only hope to find a cure

176
00:11:30,408 --> 00:11:32,175
for his worsening condition.

177
00:11:38,316 --> 00:11:42,619
And, Isaac, your feelings
towards my husband

178
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,654
for what he once did...

179
00:11:44,655 --> 00:11:46,023
They're understandable,

180
00:11:46,024 --> 00:11:48,458
but to help him in his hour of need

181
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:50,727
shows me the true measure of you...

182
00:11:50,728 --> 00:11:53,963
For which I am forever grateful.

183
00:11:56,867 --> 00:11:59,436
We will be in Boston by daybreak.

184
00:12:25,296 --> 00:12:27,030
A moment with the accused?

185
00:12:27,031 --> 00:12:28,765
Yes, magistrate.

186
00:12:37,942 --> 00:12:40,810
You've come here to kill me.

187
00:12:40,811 --> 00:12:44,281
It would be within my right to do so.

188
00:12:44,282 --> 00:12:46,383
The code of the hive is clear.

189
00:12:46,384 --> 00:12:49,286
But, no, we have agreed to spare you.

190
00:12:49,287 --> 00:12:50,820
I would allow nothing else.

191
00:12:50,821 --> 00:12:55,959
Still... to the issue at hand.

192
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,961
He will interrogate you.

193
00:12:57,962 --> 00:12:59,796
And I will give him nothing.

194
00:12:59,797 --> 00:13:04,101
I will swallow the blackened
pill before I betray the cause.

195
00:13:04,102 --> 00:13:06,603
That will be your intent, yes,

196
00:13:06,604 --> 00:13:07,837
until he tortures you

197
00:13:07,838 --> 00:13:10,540
and then, hearing your cries of pain,

198
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,075
tortures you some more,

199
00:13:12,076 --> 00:13:14,311
at which point you will beg for him

200
00:13:14,312 --> 00:13:15,979
to allow you to offer a name,

201
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,949
even if only to release
yourself from the agony.

202
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,950
When that happens...

203
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:23,953
And it will happen...

204
00:13:26,824 --> 00:13:31,094
I have just the distraction
for you to provide.

205
00:13:43,274 --> 00:13:45,542
Where do you go at night, father?

206
00:13:45,543 --> 00:13:48,879
Anne. Awake at this hour?

207
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,681
Mother says I shouldn't ask such questions,

208
00:13:51,682 --> 00:13:53,450
that I should simply be grateful

209
00:13:53,451 --> 00:13:56,219
for the sacrifices you make on our behalf.

210
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,156
Nonsense. Ask whatever you like.

211
00:13:59,157 --> 00:14:04,428
Tonight I was preoccupied
with business of the town.

212
00:14:11,102 --> 00:14:13,770
And do you believe she is a witch?

213
00:14:13,771 --> 00:14:15,538
Who?

214
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:18,041
The woman you sought out at the jail.

215
00:14:18,042 --> 00:14:19,542
You followed me?

216
00:14:19,543 --> 00:14:22,512
I simply wanted to know
what those sacrifices were

217
00:14:22,513 --> 00:14:25,115
and why they seem to be
so often made in secret.

218
00:14:25,116 --> 00:14:28,285
First you snoop about in my room,

219
00:14:28,286 --> 00:14:32,855
unearthing my belongings, and now...

220
00:14:34,058 --> 00:14:36,293
No.

221
00:14:38,463 --> 00:14:40,930
No? What?

222
00:14:40,931 --> 00:14:44,434
No, I do not believe she is a witch.

223
00:14:44,435 --> 00:14:46,669
She is but a sad, lonely woman.

224
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,970
I am glad to hear

225
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:50,540
there is some common sense left in Salem.

226
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,575
Good night, father.

227
00:14:52,576 --> 00:14:53,943
Good night, dear.

228
00:15:14,732 --> 00:15:17,134
Please! I am innocent!

229
00:15:17,135 --> 00:15:20,437
You have pled guilty to
the practice of witchcraft.

230
00:15:20,438 --> 00:15:25,175
But such a plea is not
sufficient to spare your life.

231
00:15:25,176 --> 00:15:28,878
I want names of others.

232
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:31,648
I know of no others.

233
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:33,383
Again.

234
00:15:33,384 --> 00:15:36,219
No! I swear I'm innocent!

235
00:15:40,891 --> 00:15:42,425
He's insane.

236
00:15:42,426 --> 00:15:44,994
On a good day.

237
00:15:56,307 --> 00:15:58,175
Aah!

238
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:03,246
Only the name of a fellow witch

239
00:16:03,247 --> 00:16:04,448
will spare your life.

240
00:16:04,449 --> 00:16:07,917
I know of no others.

241
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:11,921
I will ask again, but first a caution.

242
00:16:11,922 --> 00:16:14,957
The next time, the saltwater
that filled your mouth only

243
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,394
will travel down your
throat into your lungs.

244
00:16:17,395 --> 00:16:20,797
And then the taste you struggle to discern

245
00:16:20,798 --> 00:16:25,002
will not be of water,
nor of air, but of death.

246
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:28,505
A name.

247
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:33,576
Wait!

248
00:16:35,045 --> 00:16:39,015
And I wait only for the
name of a fellow witch.

249
00:16:41,852 --> 00:16:44,854
And I will give it to you.

250
00:16:46,991 --> 00:16:49,993
Her! Gloriana!

251
00:16:55,033 --> 00:16:56,366
No.

252
00:16:56,367 --> 00:16:59,569
No. No. No!

253
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,971
This is a mistake. No,
father, this is a mistake.

254
00:17:01,972 --> 00:17:03,272
Miss embry is no witch.

255
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:05,375
You are here to observe, not to interfere.

256
00:17:05,376 --> 00:17:06,509
Listen to me, father.

257
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,411
This is what I have tried to tell you,

258
00:17:08,412 --> 00:17:11,047
and now I see it to be true...
That we have been wrong.

259
00:17:11,048 --> 00:17:11,881
Cotton.

260
00:17:11,882 --> 00:17:12,982
That in our zeal

261
00:17:12,983 --> 00:17:14,183
to rid Satan from our midst,

262
00:17:14,184 --> 00:17:16,319
we are instead killing innocents.

263
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,521
Do not presume to instruct me.

264
00:17:18,522 --> 00:17:21,491
We are doing the Devil's work for him!

265
00:17:21,492 --> 00:17:24,327
And my life's work is a mistake?

266
00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:28,698
Respectfully... yes.

267
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:31,568
Stand aside.

268
00:17:31,569 --> 00:17:33,803
Please, father, I beg you... spare her.

269
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:35,071
Get out of my way.

270
00:17:35,072 --> 00:17:36,239
Listen to me!

271
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:39,275
I have.

272
00:17:39,276 --> 00:17:42,645
And I will no longer let you act the fool.

273
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:45,615
You are sure it is I who acts the fool?

274
00:17:47,285 --> 00:17:49,119
Cotton.

275
00:17:52,056 --> 00:17:55,058
Take her to the cage.

276
00:17:56,794 --> 00:17:59,429
Cotton. Cotton!

277
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,631
No.

278
00:18:01,632 --> 00:18:06,135
Cotton! Cotton!

279
00:18:21,552 --> 00:18:24,453
Oh, Lord. What is it, Mr. Sibley?

280
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:29,058
Try to breathe, Mr. Sibley. That's it.

281
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,862
Slow breath, Mr. Sibley.

282
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:34,731
That's right.

283
00:18:34,732 --> 00:18:37,200
That's it, nice and easy.

284
00:18:38,436 --> 00:18:39,402
No!

285
00:19:50,681 --> 00:19:51,237
Father!

286
00:19:51,238 --> 00:19:53,005
Father, you have no evidence.

287
00:19:53,006 --> 00:19:56,542
Nonsense. I have the
word of an admitted witch.

288
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:59,345
A woman who practices the Devil's craft?

289
00:19:59,346 --> 00:20:01,047
You trust her to finger others?

290
00:20:01,048 --> 00:20:02,582
Tell me...

291
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:05,518
Do all accusations stir
such passions in you?

292
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:08,888
Or is there something unique
about the whore's case?

293
00:20:08,889 --> 00:20:13,059
I know these people. I
have lived among them.

294
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,462
Miss embry is no tool of Satan.

295
00:20:16,463 --> 00:20:21,301
And if she were to be
examined for the Devil's marks?

296
00:20:21,302 --> 00:20:25,438
An examination?

297
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:27,140
I'm confident...

298
00:20:27,141 --> 00:20:30,143
No, I am certain... That
you would find nothing.

299
00:20:30,144 --> 00:20:33,546
In fact, yes, I would encourage
you to settle the issue

300
00:20:33,547 --> 00:20:35,114
and conduct the exam at once.

301
00:20:35,115 --> 00:20:38,818
Me? No.

302
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:41,754
No, I will leave that to you.

303
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:48,561
You will examine the accused.

304
00:21:00,508 --> 00:21:02,374
Captain.

305
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,478
No.

306
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:07,046
John!

307
00:21:12,353 --> 00:21:14,320
That wasn't the reaction I was expecting.

308
00:21:14,321 --> 00:21:16,989
Nor the greeting I was.

309
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,492
The other night...

310
00:21:19,493 --> 00:21:22,328
What we said... what we did.

311
00:21:22,329 --> 00:21:24,264
What, do you regret it?

312
00:21:24,265 --> 00:21:26,566
No.

313
00:21:26,567 --> 00:21:30,136
My only regret is that
it can never happen again.

314
00:21:31,538 --> 00:21:34,307
I'm a married woman, John.

315
00:21:34,308 --> 00:21:36,509
With a very sick husband.

316
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:39,979
Mr. Sibley would never
do me the favor of dying.

317
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,046
We both know that.

318
00:21:41,047 --> 00:21:43,015
He was taken to hospital.

319
00:21:43,016 --> 00:21:45,318
From where he will surely return...

320
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:48,254
As alive and married as ever.

321
00:21:48,255 --> 00:21:51,257
Is that the reason?

322
00:21:51,258 --> 00:21:52,992
Sibley?

323
00:21:52,993 --> 00:21:54,394
Nothing else?

324
00:21:54,395 --> 00:21:56,028
Not a fear?

325
00:21:56,029 --> 00:22:00,032
Or a secret that you
think I couldn't accept?

326
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:01,934
Because there is no one in Salem

327
00:22:01,935 --> 00:22:03,936
unburdened by their past...

328
00:22:03,937 --> 00:22:07,173
Not even me.

329
00:22:08,275 --> 00:22:10,476
I'm sorry, John.

330
00:22:15,048 --> 00:22:17,583
I hope you can understand.

331
00:22:33,267 --> 00:22:35,868
Father, please.

332
00:22:35,869 --> 00:22:37,269
Proceed.

333
00:22:54,355 --> 00:22:55,722
No marks.

334
00:22:55,723 --> 00:22:57,524
Turn her.

335
00:23:10,804 --> 00:23:12,071
Nothing.

336
00:23:12,072 --> 00:23:14,173
Raise her smock.

337
00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:27,953
Still nothing.

338
00:23:27,954 --> 00:23:30,423
The upper torso.

339
00:23:38,899 --> 00:23:40,600
Father...

340
00:23:40,601 --> 00:23:42,769
The upper torso.

341
00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:17,737
Wait.

342
00:24:35,588 --> 00:24:37,690
So, you see, as I assured you,

343
00:24:37,691 --> 00:24:39,525
she bears no signs of a Devil's agent,

344
00:24:39,526 --> 00:24:41,393
no blemishes, no witches' teats.

345
00:24:41,394 --> 00:24:44,063
All of which I will be sure
to mention at her trial.

346
00:24:44,064 --> 00:24:45,598
Her trial?

347
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:48,801
But I have proven to
you she is without marks.

348
00:24:48,802 --> 00:24:52,338
Have you forgotten? We are not judges.

349
00:24:52,339 --> 00:24:55,107
We are simply seekers of the truth.

350
00:24:55,108 --> 00:24:58,544
The power of verdict
rests with the selectmen.

351
00:24:58,545 --> 00:25:01,046
This is Salem. You know how they will vote.

352
00:25:01,047 --> 00:25:03,015
Well, then you save

353
00:25:03,016 --> 00:25:05,851
your rage and your impudence for them.

354
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:26,872
Another woman was accused
today... as you saw.

355
00:25:26,873 --> 00:25:29,709
It's madness, this witch panic.

356
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,944
Yes, it is regrettable.

357
00:25:31,945 --> 00:25:34,079
Regrettable?

358
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,347
What would you have me do?

359
00:25:35,348 --> 00:25:37,783
You could speak out, rail against it.

360
00:25:37,784 --> 00:25:41,120
You have any number of
options beyond nothing.

361
00:25:41,121 --> 00:25:43,789
I am one man. Perhaps
you expect too much of me.

362
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,325
Perhaps you are content with too little.

363
00:25:45,326 --> 00:25:48,227
Hold your tongue, child.

364
00:25:48,228 --> 00:25:50,362
I just don't understand

365
00:25:50,363 --> 00:25:53,733
why he's so content to see people hang...

366
00:25:53,734 --> 00:25:55,668
Almost as if he secretly likes it.

367
00:25:55,669 --> 00:25:58,337
I don't appreciate the insinuation.

368
00:25:58,338 --> 00:26:00,907
What insinuation is that?

369
00:26:00,908 --> 00:26:02,441
That I was somehow in league

370
00:26:02,442 --> 00:26:03,743
with the murdering puritans.

371
00:26:03,744 --> 00:26:06,412
Oh, no, that was not my insinuation at all.

372
00:26:07,814 --> 00:26:09,582
In fact, it was quite the opposite.

373
00:26:11,551 --> 00:26:13,619
And what might that be?

374
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:17,589
You know, I'm... I'm suddenly very tired.

375
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,925
What are you accusing me of?

376
00:26:18,926 --> 00:26:20,526
I think I should lie down.

377
00:26:20,527 --> 00:26:23,362
Anne, do not walk away until
you have explained yourself.

378
00:26:23,363 --> 00:26:25,164
Anne!

379
00:26:37,811 --> 00:26:40,212
May I ask you a question?

380
00:26:40,213 --> 00:26:42,448
Why does he hate you?

381
00:26:42,449 --> 00:26:44,349
Two reasons only...

382
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,485
For what I am...

383
00:26:46,486 --> 00:26:50,156
And what I am not.

384
00:26:50,157 --> 00:26:52,257
And you've appealed to
him on the girl's behalf?

385
00:26:52,258 --> 00:26:55,861
Repeatedly. He does not regard me.

386
00:26:55,862 --> 00:27:00,533
Truth told, he does not
regard anyone except...

387
00:27:00,534 --> 00:27:02,734
For you, John.

388
00:27:02,735 --> 00:27:04,136
Cotton, no.

389
00:27:04,137 --> 00:27:07,506
You are everything he ever wished me to be.

390
00:27:07,507 --> 00:27:09,809
You are a hero in war.

391
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:14,379
You are a man without weakness or frailty.

392
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:17,349
Cotton, I'm sorry.

393
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:21,954
Begging another puritan
asshole to do the right thing?

394
00:27:21,955 --> 00:27:25,057
Since when has it worked?

395
00:27:25,058 --> 00:27:28,460
- And why would it work now?
- You're right.

396
00:27:28,461 --> 00:27:32,331
No man should be forced to
humble himself before my father.

397
00:27:32,332 --> 00:27:36,669
I have been in Salem for months.

398
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:40,339
I have made allies and enemies in scores.

399
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,643
But the closest thing that
I have come to a friend...

400
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:48,214
Is you.

401
00:27:48,215 --> 00:27:50,916
So I ask you...

402
00:27:50,917 --> 00:27:54,620
I beg you...

403
00:27:54,621 --> 00:27:56,856
To appeal to my father,

404
00:27:56,857 --> 00:28:00,259
if there is some small part of you

405
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,661
that can call me a friend, too.

406
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:18,511
Mr. Sibley?

407
00:28:44,004 --> 00:28:46,572
Mr. Sibley?!

408
00:28:54,047 --> 00:28:56,448
Mr. Sibley?!

409
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,362
Mr. Sibley.

410
00:29:10,363 --> 00:29:12,698
Help me, Isaac.

411
00:29:15,636 --> 00:29:18,037
You can speak.

412
00:29:18,038 --> 00:29:21,073
The Lord's miraculous workings.

413
00:29:21,074 --> 00:29:23,209
You're leaking blood.

414
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:26,578
Which is why I need your help.

415
00:29:26,579 --> 00:29:29,215
Go to Salem.

416
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:34,486
Return with supplies and
one to administer them.

417
00:29:34,487 --> 00:29:36,856
Help you?

418
00:29:36,857 --> 00:29:39,992
Yes.

419
00:29:41,828 --> 00:29:44,463
Do you remember the day you marked me?

420
00:29:46,633 --> 00:29:51,537
The day you seared my flesh
with the sign of the fornicator?

421
00:29:51,538 --> 00:29:54,006
You remember that?

422
00:29:54,007 --> 00:29:58,710
And I would imagine that
not a moment has since passed

423
00:29:58,711 --> 00:30:00,379
that you didn't wish me dead.

424
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:06,752
And now your chance,
without even raising a hand.

425
00:30:06,753 --> 00:30:10,289
Walk away, and I will surely die here.

426
00:30:13,193 --> 00:30:15,160
Why shouldn't I?

427
00:30:15,161 --> 00:30:19,364
Because while you desired revenge

428
00:30:19,365 --> 00:30:24,103
I bore regret for what I did.

429
00:30:24,104 --> 00:30:27,539
Words.

430
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:30,309
Then help me, and I will shower you

431
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:33,312
not with words, but gold,

432
00:30:33,313 --> 00:30:37,249
more than you've ever hoped to possess.

433
00:30:39,085 --> 00:30:40,452
Gold?

434
00:30:40,453 --> 00:30:43,722
To return with... with
medicines and Mrs. Sibley?

435
00:30:43,723 --> 00:30:45,024
No.

436
00:30:45,025 --> 00:30:45,958
Not her.

437
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:48,260
Increase.

438
00:30:48,261 --> 00:30:49,728
Increase?

439
00:30:49,729 --> 00:30:51,664
Tell my wife nothing.

440
00:30:51,665 --> 00:30:55,434
Bring me Increase Mather at once.

441
00:30:57,838 --> 00:30:59,938
Go now, boy!

442
00:30:59,939 --> 00:31:02,574
Run!

443
00:31:02,575 --> 00:31:04,276
Run!

444
00:31:04,277 --> 00:31:06,211
Run!

445
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:39,898
Yes?

446
00:31:43,136 --> 00:31:44,570
Reverend.

447
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:47,272
The answer is no.

448
00:31:47,273 --> 00:31:49,240
I didn't ask a question.

449
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:52,077
You're here to beg for the
whore's life, are you not?

450
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:55,680
Dispatched by my besotted son, no doubt.

451
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:57,082
Yes.

452
00:31:57,083 --> 00:32:01,053
Well, let me save you the
trouble, Captain Alden.

453
00:32:01,054 --> 00:32:04,422
The decision has been
made to take her to trial.

454
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:09,094
But rest assured I will
be sure to tell Cotton

455
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:11,397
that your pleas were most heartfelt.

456
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:15,133
Sir... Gloriana is no witch.

457
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:16,534
No.

458
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:20,706
But I think you will agree
she has bewitched my son.

459
00:32:24,377 --> 00:32:27,012
You know, my father held
you in high regard, Reverend.

460
00:32:27,013 --> 00:32:29,481
Alden sr. Was a good man.

461
00:32:29,482 --> 00:32:32,451
He viewed the world with uncommon reason.

462
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:36,021
Yeah, well, except when
it came to his own son.

463
00:32:38,758 --> 00:32:41,760
He wanted me to study scripture,

464
00:32:41,761 --> 00:32:44,530
and I chose to explore the woods.

465
00:32:44,531 --> 00:32:47,065
He wanted me to attend university,

466
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:48,767
and I volunteered for war.

467
00:32:48,768 --> 00:32:52,871
He went to his grave thinking
my life's choices mistakes.

468
00:32:57,209 --> 00:33:00,578
And yet he allowed you to make them.

469
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:02,981
Well, that's because
he knew the difference.

470
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:04,315
Between?

471
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,685
Between loving his son's choices

472
00:33:06,686 --> 00:33:08,854
and loving his son.

473
00:33:25,204 --> 00:33:26,572
Captain Alden.

474
00:33:26,573 --> 00:33:28,640
Isaac, what is it?

475
00:33:28,641 --> 00:33:31,442
Not here.

476
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:36,081
George Sibley can speak?

477
00:33:36,082 --> 00:33:37,715
As clearly as you or I.

478
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:39,551
And wounded, he doesn't request his wife,

479
00:33:39,552 --> 00:33:41,152
- but asks for...
- Increase Mather.

480
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:45,590
I trust him no more than a thief.

481
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:48,927
But to disobey a man of his standing?

482
00:33:50,997 --> 00:33:52,730
Then do nothing.

483
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,568
Captain?

484
00:33:56,569 --> 00:34:00,706
You sought my advice, so I offer it.

485
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:02,641
Do nothing.

486
00:34:02,642 --> 00:34:04,509
But to leave him any longer

487
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,511
than I have in the woods, bleeding...

488
00:34:06,512 --> 00:34:08,179
He will die.

489
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:12,217
Yes.

490
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:15,020
Does he deserve anything less?

491
00:34:15,021 --> 00:34:17,823
The man who marked your flesh...

492
00:34:17,824 --> 00:34:19,891
Drove me to war...

493
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:23,461
And has ruled over Salem
like a power-mad king?

494
00:34:23,462 --> 00:34:26,031
And now, what, he begs for compassion?

495
00:34:26,032 --> 00:34:28,700
Cooperation?

496
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:34,605
What?

497
00:34:37,643 --> 00:34:40,478
I know you love her, Captain.

498
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:44,282
But to leave him to die is murder.

499
00:34:46,819 --> 00:34:51,456
Do... nothing.

500
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,970
No. Where are you taking me?

501
00:35:06,472 --> 00:35:09,607
Tell me! Where are you taking me?!

502
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:12,811
Good people of Salem,

503
00:35:12,812 --> 00:35:15,847
it has come to my attention

504
00:35:15,848 --> 00:35:19,650
that the accusation leveled today

505
00:35:19,651 --> 00:35:22,720
was a trick of the witches...

506
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:28,493
An infernal ploy to delude and
distract from the truly guilty.

507
00:35:28,494 --> 00:35:33,965
This woman is no sorceress.

508
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:38,336
And therefore she will not go to trial.

509
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:47,746
But what her advocates fail to grasp

510
00:35:47,747 --> 00:35:52,884
is that absence of guilt
does not mean innocence...

511
00:35:52,885 --> 00:35:58,423
For this whore is no
innocent... Far from it.

512
00:35:58,424 --> 00:36:01,793
She is guilty of sin, sins of the flesh,

513
00:36:01,794 --> 00:36:05,296
sins against God, sins
both mortal and eternal,

514
00:36:05,297 --> 00:36:09,500
and as such, she warrants
no place in Salem.

515
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:10,501
No.

516
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,971
And so, by my decree,

517
00:36:12,972 --> 00:36:15,941
she is hereby banished from our midst,

518
00:36:15,942 --> 00:36:20,311
her expulsion immediate and beyond dispute.

519
00:36:20,312 --> 00:36:23,581
And should she... Look at me...

520
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:28,853
Ever return at any time,

521
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:30,655
for any reason,

522
00:36:30,656 --> 00:36:34,025
you will find yourself once
again beside me on the common,

523
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:36,128
your lifeless body dangling

524
00:36:36,129 --> 00:36:39,397
from the wrong end of the hangman's noose.

525
00:36:39,398 --> 00:36:40,232
Take her.

526
00:36:40,233 --> 00:36:41,332
Cotton!

527
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:43,901
- Gloriana!
- Cotton! Cotton!

528
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:46,071
Cotton! Cotton!

529
00:36:46,072 --> 00:36:48,373
- Gloriana!
- Stand back. Stay back.

530
00:36:48,374 --> 00:36:50,942
No! Gloriana!

531
00:36:57,884 --> 00:36:59,851
I'm sorry.

532
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:07,658
Take her as far as your steeds will travel.

533
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:13,098
And let it be known

534
00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:16,268
neither sin nor sinner

535
00:37:16,269 --> 00:37:20,071
have any place in Salem.

536
00:37:39,487 --> 00:37:41,756
George.

537
00:37:41,757 --> 00:37:44,492
I don't know how or by whom,

538
00:37:44,493 --> 00:37:47,261
but the familiar has been excised from him.

539
00:37:47,262 --> 00:37:50,998
He could be anywhere right
now, talking to anyone.

540
00:37:50,999 --> 00:37:52,634
All that we've worked for,

541
00:37:52,635 --> 00:37:55,837
all that I've sacrificed,
incinerated in an instant.

542
00:37:55,838 --> 00:37:58,339
Calm yourself and help me.

543
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:19,661
Mutare, et notum sumbotis.

544
00:38:19,662 --> 00:38:22,797
Forma enim esse ostendit.

545
00:38:22,798 --> 00:38:25,433
Corpus, anima, mens.

546
00:38:25,434 --> 00:38:27,969
Lead me to the one I seek.

547
00:38:38,113 --> 00:38:40,648
The creature will lead me to him.

548
00:38:40,649 --> 00:38:44,018
With luck, I will find him quickly.

549
00:38:44,019 --> 00:38:46,955
And without it, we shall all burn.

550
00:39:01,904 --> 00:39:05,940
You take issue with my methods.

551
00:39:05,941 --> 00:39:09,510
I understand.

552
00:39:09,511 --> 00:39:14,148
What you need to understand
is that everything I have done

553
00:39:14,149 --> 00:39:18,286
has been to make you
worthy of the Mather name.

554
00:39:20,189 --> 00:39:22,256
I loved her.

555
00:39:22,257 --> 00:39:24,392
Do not say that.

556
00:39:24,393 --> 00:39:28,863
My silence does not make it untrue.

557
00:39:28,864 --> 00:39:31,599
One day,

558
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:37,905
when you are governor of this great land,

559
00:39:37,906 --> 00:39:43,645
a man of power and a model of virtue,

560
00:39:43,646 --> 00:39:47,348
respected and feared in equal measure,

561
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:50,151
you will trace it back to this day...

562
00:39:52,621 --> 00:39:56,790
The day I removed
temptation from your path.

563
00:40:20,883 --> 00:40:22,917
- You there.
- Yes?

564
00:40:22,918 --> 00:40:26,087
Bring me some black tea,
very strong, if you please.

565
00:40:26,088 --> 00:40:27,621
Mm-hmm.

566
00:40:32,494 --> 00:40:34,395
Are you not the young man

567
00:40:34,396 --> 00:40:37,965
who transported Mr.
Sibley to Boston yesterday?

568
00:40:37,966 --> 00:40:41,069
Isaac, sir.

569
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,836
- Isaac.
- Mm.

570
00:40:42,837 --> 00:40:45,239
Boston and back?

571
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,008
Record time.

572
00:40:47,009 --> 00:40:48,876
You must be quite the horseman, Isaac.

573
00:40:48,877 --> 00:40:51,645
No, I-I wouldn't say that.

574
00:40:51,646 --> 00:40:53,414
Well, tell me.

575
00:40:53,415 --> 00:40:57,018
Did the physician offer any insight

576
00:40:57,019 --> 00:40:59,787
into the patient's condition?

577
00:40:59,788 --> 00:41:03,090
Physician?

578
00:41:03,091 --> 00:41:07,060
A diagnosis? Or a prognosis?

579
00:41:07,061 --> 00:41:10,131
Um...

580
00:41:10,132 --> 00:41:12,900
No, I can't...

581
00:41:14,069 --> 00:41:15,869
Well, you did take Mr. Sibley

582
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:17,805
to the hospital, did you not?

583
00:41:17,806 --> 00:41:22,143
What is it you are not saying?

584
00:41:22,144 --> 00:41:25,646
Isaac... look at me.

585
00:41:29,318 --> 00:41:32,086
Tell me the truth about your journey.

586
00:41:38,893 --> 00:41:41,895
The injured is due South, inland,

587
00:41:41,896 --> 00:41:44,431
on the wooded path to Boston.

588
00:41:46,802 --> 00:41:47,969
Hyah!

589
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:49,503
Clear the way.

590
00:43:32,974 --> 00:43:35,776
Who's there? Show yourself.

591
00:43:35,777 --> 00:43:38,079
Who are you?

592
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,880
The name is Petrus.

593
00:43:39,881 --> 00:43:43,250
Not an hour ago, I spied you sleeping,

594
00:43:43,251 --> 00:43:47,021
and, seeing your grave wound,
I have returned with medicinals.

595
00:43:47,022 --> 00:43:50,291
Stop. Not one step closer.

596
00:43:50,292 --> 00:43:53,261
But, sir, an infection
has already taken root.

597
00:43:53,262 --> 00:43:56,797
Do not worry yourself. Aid is on the way.

598
00:43:57,865 --> 00:44:00,634
But you are in pain, are you not?

599
00:44:00,635 --> 00:44:06,407
I have concocted a simple
physic to ease your suffering.

600
00:44:06,408 --> 00:44:12,413
No creature, man or animal,
should suffer as you do, sir.

601
00:44:14,116 --> 00:44:15,882
Please.

602
00:44:30,865 --> 00:44:33,367
What have you given me?

603
00:44:34,536 --> 00:44:37,404
I am truly sorry, sir.

604
00:44:41,643 --> 00:44:43,410
She made me.

605
00:44:47,215 --> 00:44:49,249
We will take him to your shack

606
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:50,651
until the threat has passed.

607
00:44:50,652 --> 00:44:53,354
Did you really think it would be so easy

608
00:44:53,355 --> 00:44:56,823
to escape us, Mr. Sibley?

609
00:44:58,927 --> 00:45:03,063
There, up ahead!

610
00:45:08,003 --> 00:45:11,172
George? George?

611
00:45:15,677 --> 00:45:17,378
You're the servant?

612
00:45:17,379 --> 00:45:19,179
Yes, sir, sent by Mrs. Sibley

613
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:20,747
to retrieve her ailing husband.

614
00:45:20,748 --> 00:45:23,184
This is worse than I had feared.

615
00:45:23,185 --> 00:45:25,386
Which is why he needs to be
taken to hospital at once.

616
00:45:25,387 --> 00:45:26,454
No.

617
00:45:26,455 --> 00:45:29,357
It is not the injury that troubles me,

618
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:31,525
but how he came by it.

619
00:45:31,526 --> 00:45:34,127
He sought to free himself
from the witches' grip.

620
00:45:34,128 --> 00:45:35,829
I do not understand.

621
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:37,398
The man is not ill.

622
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:41,702
He has been spelled.

623
00:45:41,703 --> 00:45:44,538
Might you know something about that?

624
00:45:50,945 --> 00:45:52,946
Miss Hale.

625
00:45:52,947 --> 00:45:55,015
Do you remember that
afternoon in the graveyard,

626
00:45:55,016 --> 00:45:56,950
when you implied my
father is not who he seems?

627
00:45:56,951 --> 00:45:58,952
Yes.

628
00:45:58,953 --> 00:46:02,689
Invite me inside, and
I'll tell you why I agree.

629
00:46:20,509 --> 00:46:23,010
Tell me... where is Mr. Sibley?

630
00:46:23,011 --> 00:46:24,445
We have a problem.

631
00:46:24,446 --> 00:46:25,746
That was not my question.

632
00:46:25,747 --> 00:46:27,781
Either you know where he is, or you don't.

633
00:46:27,782 --> 00:46:29,150
I do know where he is,

634
00:46:29,151 --> 00:46:30,718
and that is the problem.

635
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:33,320
The Reverend has deemed
him a victim of witchcraft

636
00:46:33,321 --> 00:46:36,724
and has decided that George
is to rest under his care.

637
00:46:36,725 --> 00:46:39,126
Quickly now. Make haste.

638
00:46:39,127 --> 00:46:40,828
My God.

639
00:46:40,829 --> 00:46:43,163
Petrus' physic will last but a day.

640
00:46:43,164 --> 00:46:44,831
There. There.

641
00:46:44,832 --> 00:46:48,235
And then Mr. Sibley will
awake, lucid and eager.

642
00:46:48,236 --> 00:46:51,104
To tell Increase everything.

643
00:46:51,105 --> 00:46:53,286
