1
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:13,300
Just fire me instead!

2
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,600
If you really want to fire someone
that badly, start with me!

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,300
Nam Jung Gi...
you really want me to do it?

4
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,899
Just kill me instead!

5
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:28,600
<i>[Episode 12]</i>

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,100
Fine! If you really want it, I--
you think I can't fire you?

7
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,200
You just asked me to, didn't you?

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,500
You insolent punk... and after how
I doted on you so much, all this time!

9
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,399
Geez.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,200
<i>So why the hell did you
all receive bribes?</i>

11
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,799
<i>At the very least, you shouldn't have
gotten caught if you did, you punks!</i>

12
00:01:17,754 --> 00:01:20,653
<i>What is it that you
really want to protect?</i>

13
00:01:20,653 --> 00:01:22,853
Do you still, by any chance

14
00:01:22,853 --> 00:01:25,953
believe that there's something more
important in this world than money?

15
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:28,754
There was once a time
when you believed that, too.

16
00:01:28,754 --> 00:01:34,754
And you saw the value of things
like happiness, pride, and love.

17
00:01:34,754 --> 00:01:37,439
And in that state, you were dazzling
enough even though you had nothing.

18
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,340
And now I've come to realize that
those things are all useless.

19
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,340
So? Is your present self even happy?

20
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,840
Aw, are you worried about me?

21
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:58,439
I want you to be happy. I felt this way
before, and I still truly do. Trust me.

22
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:02,040
Sorry, but I don't believe in the
trust that humans have to offer.

23
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,239
You can easily buy that
from people with money.

24
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,840
And it's a fickle thing.

25
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:10,340
At the very least,
money doesn't lie.

26
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:14,539
From now on, pick up
my calls immediately.

27
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:18,039
When I tell you to come, come.
And when I tell you to go, go.

28
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:21,939
Be meek and do as I tell you,
like you did before.

29
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:28,840
Then maybe, just maybe,
you can protect those people.

30
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,740
Though I'm not sure they're
worth protecting.

31
00:02:35,278 --> 00:02:37,639
<i>What's going to happen to us now?</i>

32
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:40,939
You saw how the President was
acting toward Deputy Chief Nam, right?

33
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:43,240
Yeah. He was being real stubborn.

34
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,740
But why, exactly, is
he trying to fire people?

35
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,439
I think that I'm probably going
to be the first one to be fired.

36
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:53,039
I'm a temp worker, and I
sold Lovely out last time.

37
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,340
No, that's not true. Chief Ok is
covering that up, remember?

38
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,639
Just trust in her, okay?

39
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:00,039
And you're the only designer
on the Marketing Team.

40
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:02,240
It's not like they're going
to fire the only designer.

41
00:03:03,175 --> 00:03:07,340
Really? Will I really be okay?

42
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,240
I'm the one who should be worried!

43
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,340
I left work early and was late
because of my kid last time.

44
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,840
The President yelled at me about that.

45
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,740
But you're in charge
of our online store.

46
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,740
There's so much work to be
done for that right now.

47
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:23,139
There's no way they'd fire you over
being late a couple of times.

48
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:24,439
- Don't worry.
- Yes.

49
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:26,939
You were one of the founding members
of this company, with the President.

50
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:30,139
Right? I'll be okay, right?

51
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:35,039
And we can't develop new products
without Deputy Chief Nam

52
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,039
so it won't be him.
Then...

53
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,939
No way... will it be me?

54
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:49,539
Well, yeah. I don't specialize in one
thing and just do a little of everything.

55
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:52,139
- I'm sure I'd be the first to go.
- Hey! That's not true!

56
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:55,039
There's so many things that you do!
Don't you worry.

57
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,639
You're Deputy Chief Nam's
right-hand man!

58
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:58,740
I'm sure that Deputy Chief Nam
will protect you, for sure.

59
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,939
We're the team that developed Pat Pat,
so why do we have to go through this?

60
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:05,939
I know, right? Exactly!

61
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:07,840
This is driving me crazy!

62
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,740
Hey, we've been outside
for too long. Let's go!

63
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:29,639
<i>Do those people even value you?</i>

64
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,240
<i>What do you mean by that?</i>

65
00:04:32,156 --> 00:04:36,939
If you were to tell those people to pick
between you and money right now

66
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:39,040
which one would they choose, I wonder?

67
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,339
- Want to bet on it?
- Crazy bastard.

68
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:51,639
If those people do choose you,
I promise to get out of your hair.

69
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:55,939
I'll leave you and Lovely alone,
forever.

70
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,240
- Are you that confident?
- It's money, after all.

71
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,939
I've never met a person
who said that they hate money.

72
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:20,339
Oh, Chief! Did you just
get back from someplace?

73
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:22,540
I had a personal affair to attend to.

74
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:28,740
It's utter chaos here right now. Do you
think you could convince the President...

75
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,139
Do you like money,
Deputy Chief Nam?

76
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:38,639
Excuse me?

77
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:44,240
Well, who in the world would
say that they hate money?

78
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,740
Would you want to quit working at
this kind of place if you had money?

79
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,939
Well, I can't make a
statement like that, but--

80
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:53,939
Having to endure the haughtiness of
superiors, and having to grovel...

81
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:56,740
isn't it true that you wouldn't have to
endure these things if you had money?

82
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,240
Um, why are you asking this
sort of thing, all of the sudden?

83
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,540
- Chief.
- I was just curious.

84
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,240
I wanted to know what
this place means to you

85
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,240
and whether or not it was worth
more than just money to you.

86
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,639
Well, whatever.

87
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:26,439
Where have all of you been?

88
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:28,339
You should be at your
desks more at times like this.

89
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:30,839
We felt too uneasy to sit still,
so we went out for some fresh air.

90
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:33,439
Oh, the Chief is here!

91
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:39,639
- Did you try talking to her?
- Huh? Yeah.

92
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:42,639
- I did, but...
- What did she say?

93
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,639
Does she have a countermeasure planned?

94
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,540
- She asked me, "do you like money?"
- Huh?

95
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,740
That's all she said before
going back into her office.

96
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:57,240
- What the hell does that mean?
- Exactly. I have no idea.

97
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,740
Oh, how nice.

98
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:12,339
You're worried about a
lot of things as of late, right?

99
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:15,939
It's not easy to do restructuring.

100
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:20,639
Well, nothing lasts forever.
Isn't that right?

101
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,939
Of course! You can cut
out needless expenses

102
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:25,040
and your product will sell
well as long as it gets produced

103
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,540
and it's only a matter of time before
you find replacements for them, anyway.

104
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:32,740
I have tons of people working for me who
do nothing but collect their paychecks.

105
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,240
And it really pisses me off, it does!

106
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,540
You've made a courageous decision.
Let's clap for him together!

107
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,939
- All right! Claps!
- Claps!

108
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:45,439
Geez, you people.

109
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:52,439
If everything goes well this time around
I'll help you out, so don't worry.

110
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:58,639
I heard you found an investor.
Couldn't you maybe introduce me to him?

111
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,740
- Can I get in on that, too?
- And you can't leave me out!

112
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:08,639
Well, CEO Lee is quite
a busy person, you see.

113
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,339
I'll try talking to him about it
after the restructuring is over.

114
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:18,740
- Wow... you're our savior!
- I thought Director Kim was.

115
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,839
As if! How could I compare you
to that Director Kim?

116
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:25,240
Of course! You're obviously the best!

117
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,639
- Yes, of course!
- Obviously!

118
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,940
Did you call for me, sir?

119
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,740
- Yeah, come on in.
- Yes, sir?

120
00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:42,835
I have something that I need
to ask of you this time.

121
00:08:42,835 --> 00:08:45,835
Yes, sir? Just say the word!

122
00:08:45,835 --> 00:08:48,835
Hand in your resignation letter.

123
00:08:49,335 --> 00:08:51,934
Excuse me?
Resignation... letter?

124
00:08:51,934 --> 00:08:59,235
Yeah, a resignation letter.
Can you do that for me?

125
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:06,434
Please forgive me just this once, sir!
If there's something that I did wrong

126
00:09:06,434 --> 00:09:07,835
I'll take responsibility for it!

127
00:09:07,835 --> 00:09:09,434
If there's something you don't like
about me, just say the word!

128
00:09:09,434 --> 00:09:11,235
Please, just let me go
this once, sir!

129
00:09:11,235 --> 00:09:16,835
I'm telling you, Manager Yang
is such a dramatic person!

130
00:09:16,835 --> 00:09:17,934
Excuse me?

131
00:09:17,934 --> 00:09:22,335
The thing is,
someone came to scout you out.

132
00:09:29,934 --> 00:09:31,971
I've heard a lot about you
from Director Kim.

133
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:33,654
I heard that you're quite
a skilled individual.

134
00:09:33,654 --> 00:09:37,955
That's why I wanted to ask you to do
some freelance work for me.

135
00:09:43,654 --> 00:09:49,455
This is the down payment I'd give you,
regardless of how long the project takes.

136
00:09:54,654 --> 00:10:00,254
One? Do you mean 1,000...

137
00:10:00,254 --> 00:10:04,955
Think bigger, my friend.
I'm talking about 100 million won.

138
00:10:04,955 --> 00:10:07,955
Just finish up this one project well
and come back to me.

139
00:10:07,955 --> 00:10:11,355
If you do, I'll make sure you can
come back to your original position.

140
00:10:13,855 --> 00:10:15,554
You have confidence that
you'll do well, right?

141
00:10:17,054 --> 00:10:19,154
Thank you, sir!

142
00:10:19,154 --> 00:10:23,355
Why are you thanking me?
You should be thanking CEO Lee.

143
00:10:23,355 --> 00:10:26,855
Thank you, CEO Lee!
I'll do my best!

144
00:10:29,855 --> 00:10:35,054
<i>All I did was write a number, and
I've got him bowing down like this.</i>

145
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,654
You can't even catch that?
Seriously?

146
00:10:50,054 --> 00:10:52,455
- That's right!
- Honey.

147
00:10:52,455 --> 00:10:55,855
- Should I just quit and be a housewife?
- I mean...

148
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:58,654
it's getting harder and
harder for your mother

149
00:10:58,654 --> 00:11:01,754
and Ji Ho will be starting school soon.

150
00:11:01,754 --> 00:11:03,554
I feel like I'll have to help him
with his studies a bit.

151
00:11:03,554 --> 00:11:09,455
What nonsense is that?
In difficult times such as this -- yes!

152
00:11:09,455 --> 00:11:13,355
Geez! Anyway, in these times, it
won't work if I'm the only breadwinner.

153
00:11:13,355 --> 00:11:15,754
Right?
It won't work, right?

154
00:11:15,754 --> 00:11:21,054
- That's right! Yeah!
- Lower the volume!

155
00:11:21,554 --> 00:11:24,955
<i>Have you been eating well?
Is there anything going on at work?</i>

156
00:11:24,955 --> 00:11:26,654
Of course not.
Everything's fine.

157
00:11:26,654 --> 00:11:32,554
- Mom, you're not sick or in pain, right?
<i>- No, I'm totally fine!</i>

158
00:11:32,554 --> 00:11:35,455
<i>Make sure you're obedient
to your superiors</i>

159
00:11:35,455 --> 00:11:37,554
<i>and serve your President well, okay?</i>

160
00:11:37,554 --> 00:11:39,254
<i>And make sure you get
promoted this year, for sure!</i>

161
00:11:39,254 --> 00:11:42,855
Of course I will.
Don't worry, Mom.

162
00:11:42,855 --> 00:11:45,153
I'll talk to you later.

163
00:12:00,455 --> 00:12:03,355
How will I make a living
if I do get fired?

164
00:12:16,855 --> 00:12:19,455
<i>Do you like money,
Deputy Chief Nam?</i>

165
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:23,355
Would you want to quit working at
this kind of place if you had money?

166
00:12:23,355 --> 00:12:25,355
Having to endure the haughtiness of
superiors, and having to grovel...

167
00:12:25,355 --> 00:12:28,394
isn't it true that you wouldn't have to
endure these things if you had money?

168
00:12:29,754 --> 00:12:35,254
What could it be?
Why did she ask me that?

169
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,355
Oh, this is so frustrating!

170
00:12:44,455 --> 00:12:47,455
Oh, good work.
Go on home and rest now.

171
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:54,154
Please reconsider, President.

172
00:12:54,154 --> 00:12:56,054
With the opening of the duty-free shop
and getting onto the e-commerce site

173
00:12:56,054 --> 00:12:57,754
there are so many things
that need to be done.

174
00:12:57,754 --> 00:13:01,154
We should be looking to hire more people,
so doing this now makes no sense!

175
00:13:01,154 --> 00:13:05,455
The decision has already been made,
so don't argue and just do as I say!

176
00:13:05,455 --> 00:13:08,455
Who did you make the decision with,
without the consent of the employees?

177
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:11,754
Wasn't it with that man, Lee Ji Sang?

178
00:13:12,455 --> 00:13:15,554
You said that you'd take care of it,
and wouldn't give him executive power.

179
00:13:15,554 --> 00:13:18,754
Has that person already begun
to become involved with management?

180
00:13:18,754 --> 00:13:21,855
Who's involved with management, now?
I'm still the President, you know!

181
00:13:21,855 --> 00:13:24,054
I told you, didn't I?

182
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:28,455
All he cares about is his own profits.
He doesn't care if the company fails!

183
00:13:28,455 --> 00:13:30,754
He's an investor who will be of
no help to helping the company grow!

184
00:13:30,754 --> 00:13:35,054
I'll be the judge of that! Stop being so
over-involved in all company affairs

185
00:13:35,054 --> 00:13:37,355
and just work hard on the work
that you're responsible for!

186
00:13:38,054 --> 00:13:41,455
I'm the president of this company!
I am!

187
00:13:48,754 --> 00:13:52,254
<i>You know, the world is actually
quite a simple place.</i>

188
00:13:53,554 --> 00:13:58,654
People who've had a taste of money
can't ever go back.

189
00:13:58,654 --> 00:14:05,154
You'll need to realize
that soon, Da Jung.

190
00:14:17,754 --> 00:14:20,054
Hey, there's really nobody
who's suitable?

191
00:14:20,054 --> 00:14:22,754
- No.
- See?

192
00:14:22,754 --> 00:14:24,955
I told you that you should've
taken more drastic measures.

193
00:14:24,955 --> 00:14:26,855
If you just leave them, they're
going to try and endure until the end!

194
00:14:26,855 --> 00:14:29,754
Don't you know how tenacious
those people are?

195
00:14:29,754 --> 00:14:31,654
- What should I do?
- It's obvious.

196
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:33,254
Make them want to
quit of their own volition.

197
00:14:33,254 --> 00:14:35,355
So, how, exactly?

198
00:14:35,355 --> 00:14:41,455
Just leave that to me.
I'll do all the dirty work.

199
00:14:41,455 --> 00:14:45,054
So you just worry about
getting the investment funds.

200
00:14:53,855 --> 00:14:58,455
Ms. Jang Mi Ri. Did you
buy the tissues on your desk?

201
00:14:58,455 --> 00:15:00,455
No, they were here.

202
00:15:00,455 --> 00:15:02,754
I see.
"Egotistical."

203
00:15:02,754 --> 00:15:06,554
These are meant to be used by everyone,
so why are you hogging them to yourself?

204
00:15:06,554 --> 00:15:10,154
Those tissues are expensive ones,
you know. Use them in moderation.

205
00:15:10,654 --> 00:15:12,654
- What the hell?
- Deputy Han.

206
00:15:12,654 --> 00:15:15,054
How many cups of coffee
have you had today?

207
00:15:15,054 --> 00:15:17,754
- It's my third. Why?
- "Addicted to caffeine."

208
00:15:17,754 --> 00:15:21,554
All that is coming out of company
funds, so drink in moderation.

209
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:25,654
Why are you pissing me off?
It's not like a cup costs that much.

210
00:15:25,654 --> 00:15:28,054
Manager Shin, what are you doing?

211
00:15:28,054 --> 00:15:32,455
You're on the internet when
you're supposed to be working.

212
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:34,554
Are you writing comments
online or something?

213
00:15:34,554 --> 00:15:37,154
It's a beauty community site.
I'm working right now!

214
00:15:37,154 --> 00:15:41,054
"Addicted to using the internet."
Hey, punk!

215
00:15:41,054 --> 00:15:44,054
I feel like you smoke longer
than you actually work here!

216
00:15:44,054 --> 00:15:47,254
- "Nicotine addition."
- What?

217
00:15:47,254 --> 00:15:50,654
Doing other things during working
hours will add up against you, too!

218
00:15:50,654 --> 00:15:53,054
- Got that?
- What the hell are you doing?

219
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:59,254
Let go! I'm doing worker
assessments, obviously!

220
00:15:59,254 --> 00:16:04,554
I'm going to be using this to take into
consideration during restructuring

221
00:16:04,554 --> 00:16:06,654
so just be aware of that.

222
00:16:08,554 --> 00:16:11,855
- How ridiculous.
- Why don't you just put a CCTV here

223
00:16:11,855 --> 00:16:15,054
- and "Big Brother" us?
- Oh, great idea.

224
00:16:15,054 --> 00:16:17,054
I'll be sure to do that for you. CCTVs.

225
00:16:17,054 --> 00:16:20,855
- What did you say?
- Manager Shin. See me.

226
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:23,654
Sure!

227
00:16:32,054 --> 00:16:36,654
Why is the President acting that way?
I'm sure you know something about it!

228
00:16:36,654 --> 00:16:40,054
Deputy Chief Nam. Are you aware
of the fact we have an investor?

229
00:16:40,054 --> 00:16:42,355
An investor?

230
00:16:42,355 --> 00:16:47,254
That guy is giving our company a
ridiculous amount of money right now.

231
00:16:47,254 --> 00:16:52,754
And it's all thanks to that that we can
have ads everywhere for our new product!

232
00:16:52,754 --> 00:16:56,554
So, that investor told him to do this?
To fire all the employees?

233
00:16:56,554 --> 00:16:59,754
He said that he'd give us
even more money

234
00:16:59,754 --> 00:17:01,254
if we decrease our expenses
and trim down our staff a bit

235
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:03,855
so it's not an offer that the
President can exactly ignore.

236
00:17:04,654 --> 00:17:09,855
So you all are trying to kick out
employees just for some more money?

237
00:17:09,855 --> 00:17:14,454
- How could you do this to us?
- Geez! You really are an idiot.

238
00:17:14,454 --> 00:17:16,055
You know,
Deputy Chief Nam...

239
00:17:16,055 --> 00:17:20,954
it's best to take cover and
do nothing during a typhoon.

240
00:17:20,954 --> 00:17:26,654
If you try to fight back, you
might be blown away. Got that?

241
00:17:40,454 --> 00:17:43,555
<i>At times like this, we must
stick together, we can't wuss out.</i>

242
00:17:43,555 --> 00:17:47,454
<i>Obviously. We can't just act alone to
try and be the only one to survive.</i>

243
00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:48,454
<i>- Got that, everyone?
- Yes, ma'am!</i>

244
00:17:48,454 --> 00:17:50,954
<i>We'll only survive if we stick together!
If we split apart, we'll all die!</i>

245
00:18:03,755 --> 00:18:07,255
You like sugar in yours, right?

246
00:18:07,755 --> 00:18:09,055
Why are you acting like this
all of a sudden? You're scaring me.

247
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:12,555
Um, sorry about before.
I was just a bit alarmed, is all.

248
00:18:12,555 --> 00:18:15,055
My voice got louder
without me realizing it.

249
00:18:16,654 --> 00:18:21,855
I'm planning on quitting drinking coffee
now. Um, what do you like?

250
00:18:21,855 --> 00:18:25,555
I have a coupon for a family restaurant.

251
00:18:25,555 --> 00:18:27,454
Ew, no thanks.

252
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:45,355
- What are you doing?
- You have a lot on your plate now

253
00:18:45,355 --> 00:18:48,454
- so you're quite fatigued, right?
- So?

254
00:18:48,454 --> 00:18:51,855
Let's drink together sometime.
I'll pay for it.

255
00:18:53,355 --> 00:18:58,055
You want to buy me dinner and drinks.
Why is everyone like this lately?

256
00:18:58,055 --> 00:19:01,855
- Wasn't I originally an outcast?
- Oh, of course not!

257
00:19:01,855 --> 00:19:04,454
Who'd make you into an outcast?

258
00:19:04,454 --> 00:19:10,654
Hey, no. You're all being
way too obvious. Lay off.

259
00:19:10,654 --> 00:19:12,855
Geez, I ought to...

260
00:19:13,355 --> 00:19:15,255
Goodbye, sir!

261
00:19:16,654 --> 00:19:20,954
<i>Let's show him our strength!
Let's present the issue to him</i>

262
00:19:20,954 --> 00:19:23,954
<i>and don't any of you dare hand
in a letter of resignation. Okay?</i>

263
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:27,454
<i>Obviously. Let's endure
for as long as we can!</i>

264
00:19:27,454 --> 00:19:32,055
<i>Let's not render ourselves into
pathetic people! We can do it!</i>

265
00:19:34,454 --> 00:19:38,055
<i>I know that both of you are
trying to butter Manager Shin up!</i>

266
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:44,555
What am I supposed to do?
You people are too much.

267
00:19:45,654 --> 00:19:51,055
<i>At first it felt like everyone was
helping and cooperating with one another</i>

268
00:19:51,055 --> 00:19:56,355
<i>but it didn't take long for everyone to
try and find their own way out.</i>

269
00:19:57,255 --> 00:20:01,555
<i>Could I say with confidence
that I'm not the same?</i>

270
00:20:02,355 --> 00:20:08,954
Does this make sense?
I have to curry his favor to survive?

271
00:20:08,954 --> 00:20:12,055
Who? You're not talking about
that damn Manager Shin, are you?

272
00:20:12,055 --> 00:20:15,954
Yeah! He's the one doing our
performance reports right now!

273
00:20:15,954 --> 00:20:21,355
He hates me because of
what happened last time!

274
00:20:21,355 --> 00:20:25,855
I'd rather die than try to
curry that damn man's favor!

275
00:20:25,855 --> 00:20:28,855
I think I'm going to be fired,
no matter how I think about it!

276
00:20:28,855 --> 00:20:31,755
What kind of criteria is that
for restructuring?

277
00:20:31,755 --> 00:20:33,355
- Wow, that really sucks.
- I know, right?

278
00:20:33,355 --> 00:20:36,055
So can you talk to your
Big Sis about this for me?

279
00:20:36,555 --> 00:20:40,055
And tell her to please
help me to not get fired.

280
00:20:40,055 --> 00:20:43,755
- Huh?
- I hate Manager Shin

281
00:20:43,755 --> 00:20:47,055
and I have nobody
that I can rely on at work!

282
00:20:48,055 --> 00:20:55,855
So please, put in a
good word for me! Okay?

283
00:20:56,055 --> 00:21:02,755
Okay. Well. Yeah, sure.
I'll try asking her

284
00:21:02,755 --> 00:21:05,855
to protect our Mi Ri!

285
00:21:05,855 --> 00:21:09,755
- Don't worry.
- Bong Gi!

286
00:21:09,755 --> 00:21:13,654
Thanks, Bong Gi!

287
00:21:18,855 --> 00:21:23,755
- Bong Gi!
- I'm sure it'll all be fine!

288
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,630
What is it that you
wanted to talk about?

289
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:33,240
I thought of a way for us to fight
against the restructuring with our power.

290
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,660
How about we all agree
to take a pay cut, instead?

291
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,230
For now, we can return
our bonuses

292
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,730
and try to help the company in
any way we can. And if we do that--

293
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,430
It's not like the company
is in dire straits

294
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,800
so why do you want to
collect less severance?

295
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,100
They need to decrease spending
because that's what the investor wants.

296
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,700
And it's better for all of us to survive
than for someone to get fired.

297
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,000
- We can't do that.
- And why not?

298
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,200
I thought that the company was
in an emergency situation.

299
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,300
We'll all take pay cuts and
decrease our expenses!

300
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,200
It's not like the company will fail
if they don't get the investment

301
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,400
so why are you offering to
take a pay cut?

302
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,900
But even so, I can't just sit
and watch someone get fired.

303
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,800
Just look at what Manager Shin is doing!
Is that really fair judgment?

304
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:17,800
What does coffee drinking and talking on
the phone have to do with performance?

305
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,500
It's not fair, nor is it unbiased.

306
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,400
Then, you do it.

307
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,000
What?

308
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,500
Do a fair and unbiased
review of the employees.

309
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:33,100
- Um, I--
- You know our team the best.

310
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,800
Analyze their performance
in an unbiased way

311
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,700
and submit that to be considered
for the restructuring process.

312
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,100
- But Chief, I'm really--
- Do it.

313
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:50,100
Wouldn't it be fairer to leave it to you
rather than to someone like Manager Shin?

314
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:56,600
<i>And so, you want me to do it?
Damn it!</i>

315
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,200
Don't worry too much.
Just trust me. Okay?

316
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,700
Thanks, Bong Gi.

317
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,900
- Oh, it's here.
- I'll be going, then.

318
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,200
Be careful on your way home!

319
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,400
Restructuring, huh?
What to do?

320
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,800
I'm worried about Mi Ri,
but about Jung Gi, too.

321
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,600
- Mr. Nam Bong Gi!
- Yes?

322
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:39,800
Your name is Nam Bong Gi, right?
And it's not Ok Bong Gi.

323
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,400
How dare you!

324
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,900
What?

325
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,900
I don't know if they changed the
passcode, but the door won't open.

326
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,800
And they won't pick
up the phone, either.

327
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,500
And I was waiting and waiting,
and it got so late.

328
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,000
Oh, but it's been so long
since you first got here!

329
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,300
You were standing there all this time?

330
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I don't really want to take these back
with me, so can I leave these with you

331
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,400
for you to give to my
kids when they get back?

332
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,900
Oh, of course!
No problem, here!

333
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:17,100
I'll store them in the refrigerator
and give this to them.

334
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,700
- Which suite do they live in, again?
- 1301. I'll leave it to you, then!

335
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,700
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you!

336
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,600
Geez, looks like the kids
changed the passcode

337
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,000
because they considered her a nuisance.

338
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,800
They don't even know how
their parent feels. Sheesh.

339
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,200
You're done with work already?
Hey! Son! Jung Gi!

340
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,800
What's wrong with him?

341
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,200
<i>You do it.</i>

342
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:52,700
Wouldn't it be fairer to leave it to you
rather than someone like Manager Shin?

343
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:57,000
Maybe something happened
at work again? Sheesh.

344
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,600
And why are you walking around
with those on at nighttime?

345
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,400
Hey, punk!
Hey, Bong Gi!

346
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,100
I held back all this time
because of Deputy Chief Nam

347
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,400
but I can't anymore.

348
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,100
Stop lying about your identity and
toying with Jang Mi Ri, right now!

349
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:19,300
Or else I'll really let you have it!
Got that?

350
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:26,700
And why's he so down?
I guess he failed another audition.

351
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:37,200
Damn it, what do I do?
I'm going to go insane!

352
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,900
Damn it, what do I do?
What do I do?

353
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,200
What are all of you hiding?

354
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:07,100
You know, I was taking a look, and
you score the lowest in diligence.

355
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,500
What?
Why me?

356
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,800
You arrive late and leave early.

357
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:18,000
Well, that couldn't be helped
because of my child.

358
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,600
But in exchange, I've been putting in
extra hours and got all my work done.

359
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:27,500
Well, documentation doesn't lie.
I'm just telling you the truth as it is.

360
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,500
Also, you should re-use paper cups.

361
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:36,300
How can a company stay afloat
with people wasting cups like that?

362
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,200
You sure don't value the
company's assets at all, do you?

363
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,100
Work, punk. What the hell
are you looking at?

364
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:52,100
What? So I'm the one
who's been targeted?

365
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:58,100
- Hey, Deputy Chief Nam!
- Yes, President?

366
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:02,200
I heard from Chief Ok that you didn't
like Manager Shin's method of assessment

367
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,700
- and complained about it.
- What?

368
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,400
- Well, yes, I did.
- Therefore...

369
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:14,200
you said that you wanted to do a fair
assessment yourself. Is that right?

370
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:19,100
What? I, um...
that's not what I said...

371
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:23,600
I believe that it is your rightful duty
as the Deputy Chief of our department.

372
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,400
But, um, I don't have
the right to judge anyone.

373
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,700
The lives of the Marketing Team
members are on the line here

374
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:34,000
but you want to pass over this duty
to the General Affairs Manager?

375
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,900
- Is that what you're saying?
- I mean, no, not exactly--

376
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,800
Sheesh! All right, give it a shot, then.

377
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,000
Do the performance reviews
and report back to me. That's all.

378
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,600
President!
President!

379
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:51,400
- Chief!
- He outranks me, I can't do anything.

380
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,400
Chief!

381
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:05,900
Wow! So our lives depend
on Deputy Chief Nam now?

382
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,600
But even so, he'll be fairer
than Manager Shin.

383
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,600
President.
President!

384
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,500
I can't do it! How could I fire
someone from our team?

385
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,300
It's my decision,
so why can't you do it?

386
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,900
- Do it!
- Don't be like that, sir.

387
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:26,500
Please reconsider! Who are the people
who made the company what it is now?

388
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,500
It's all the employees here!

389
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,100
So how could you possibly
think about firing them, overnight?

390
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,900
What? Who made the
company what it is now?

391
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,100
- All the employees of Lovely!
- Hey!

392
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,800
How dare you spout such nonsense?

393
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:44,400
Who's the one who went crawling around
for funds so I could pay all of you?

394
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,100
Do you people know how I feel?
Do you? Huh?

395
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,400
I begged and pleaded so much to
bring us to where we are!

396
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,400
But what? You people made
the company what it is?

397
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:58,000
Hey. I'm the one who made this
company what it is now!

398
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Lovely is mine!

399
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,900
I thought I could finally take a break
and then you all betray me like this?

400
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,400
- President!
- Shut it.

401
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,500
Bring me the results by
the end of this week.

402
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,800
And if you can't,
I'll fire you instead.

403
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:18,300
- President!
- Got it? Now get out! Get out!

404
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,800
This can't happen. I still have a lot
more payments left on my apartment

405
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,300
and Ji Ho's cram school fees when
he starts school will be no joke!

406
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:42,800
I really can't get fired. Can't like,
someone else volunteer instead of me?

407
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,900
But even so, you have a
husband and your own place.

408
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,600
For me, it'll be the end
if I don't make any money.

409
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,200
Where could I go after being fired from
here after just being a temp worker?

410
00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:00,000
House? As if! Except the veranda, the
entire apartment belongs to the bank!

411
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,300
But even so,
I can work nights

412
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:08,500
and even work weekends
when they call me out.

413
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,900
But it's hard for you to do
that because of your child.

414
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,600
Hey, are you two trying
to survive on your own?

415
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,900
You're saying that all you need
to do is kick me out, right?

416
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:20,400
Wow, I didn't know you two
were going to be like this.

417
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,000
Deputy Chief Nam.
Take this.

418
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:45,900
All right. Your lives are
in his hands now

419
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,300
so you don't need to hate me anymore!

420
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:56,100
So you're really going to do it?

421
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:01,100
You're not on the President's
side too, are you?

422
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:06,650
Whatever. I'm not submitting a
letter of resignation, no matter what!

423
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:09,330
Fire me if you want!
Whatever!

424
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:22,220
What a shitty company.
What do we do now?

425
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:33,520
That's why I asked Bong Gi for a favor
to put in a good word for me.

426
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,320
Try asking him too! We have to try and
get any advantage we can right now!

427
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,420
You still haven't gotten a call from
that bastard Nam Bong Gi?

428
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:45,920
What?
What do you mean, Nam Bong Gi?

429
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,620
Deputy Chief Nam.
I have something to talk to you about.

430
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:08,820
Um, Deputy Park. I'm not really in
the state to be talking right now.

431
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,720
If it's not urgent, let's talk later.

432
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,720
Before you worry about who to fire,
why not manage your brother better?

433
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,720
What are you talking about?

434
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,320
You didn't know that he lied
about being Chief Ok's little brother

435
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,320
and toyed with Ms. Mi Ri?

436
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:29,320
He even lied to her, saying that he'd
make sure she wouldn't get fired.

437
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,420
- What?
- What kind of situation is this?

438
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:36,220
I mean, everyone is on edge already
because nobody knows who'll be fired.

439
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,120
Even if you can chalk it up
to immaturity

440
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,020
he shouldn't have lied about that!

441
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:45,820
Um, is that true?
That punk really did that?

442
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:48,120
Why don't you ask him yourself?

443
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,920
So his name isn't Ok Bong Gi?

444
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,220
- Ms. Mi Ri.
- So what you're saying is...

445
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:05,320
Bong Gi is actually
your younger brother?

446
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:09,720
I'm so sorry. This is all my fault!
It's all because of me!

447
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,520
I'm so sorry, Ms. Mi Ri.

448
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:20,020
How could you-- I didn't know
you were this type of person!

449
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:25,720
He was toying with your subordinate,
pretending to be someone else...

450
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,820
you knew that, and yet you did nothing?

451
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:37,720
- No, it's not like that!
- I'm so disappointed in you!

452
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,120
This bastard!

453
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:57,820
- Oh, Dad! You're just getting home?
- Yeah, you're home a bit late.

454
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,820
Nam Woo Joo, go to your room
and listen to some music.

455
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:06,420
Uncle, you caused trouble again,
didn't you?

456
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:10,520
- Huh? No.
- Nam Woo Joo. Now!

457
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,520
Yes, sir.

458
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:33,420
Why do you live your life like that?

459
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,520
What are you saying?
What's wrong with my lifestyle?

460
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,420
How could you pretend that
you were Chief Ok's little brother?

461
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:46,120
Hear me out first, Big Bro.
It's not that I deliberately did that.

462
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,920
They misunderstood and thought
that I was her younger brother first!

463
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,820
All I said was that I was close
to someone at Lovely Cosmetics--

464
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,720
- You terrible bastard.
- Big Bro!

465
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,820
All you do is drink all night
when you're unemployed

466
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:01,820
and you have no source of income,
but use all the money you want.

467
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:04,320
You make a big deal out of yourself
and think of life to be easy

468
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,020
and now, you're even lying
about your identity?

469
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,320
And this kind of scum
is my little brother?

470
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,320
- Are you finished?
- You think life is a joke, right?

471
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,320
It's totally fun, right?

472
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,620
Meanwhile, do you know what kids your
age go through to just try and survive?

473
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:22,620
I do! I'm right beside them, watching.

474
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,520
Who else puts their all into
surviving as you do, after all?

475
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,120
You wake up early in the morning
and work until late at night.

476
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:31,820
You have to go back to work, too, at
night or on weekends when they need you.

477
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:34,820
You can barely get a proper
glimpse of your only son's face

478
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:39,420
and do everything at work,
besides eating and sleeping.

479
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:43,520
But here you are, worried
that you'll be fired in your forties

480
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,420
because of internal restructuring.

481
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,120
Is that really the right way
to live your life?

482
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:54,620
- You little--
- I work hard, too!

483
00:35:54,620 --> 00:36:00,120
It's hard for me, too! I'm just living
my life a bit differently than others.

484
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:04,620
So, Big Bro...
don't worry about me.

485
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:24,120
<i>Yeah. Who am I to judge
how someone else lives?</i>

486
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:30,220
<i>I gave my youth to this company
and yet I'm worried about getting fired.</i>

487
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:39,220
<i>And I'm here wondering if I should
fire someone so I can survive.</i>

488
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,820
<i>Who am I to judge?</i>

489
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,250
Jang Mi Ri.

490
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:14,920
- Mi Ri.
- Terrible bastard.

491
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,720
- Who is it?
- Oh, hello.

492
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,720
So you are home today. I rang a couple
of times, but nobody was here.

493
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,820
Oh... Woo Joo's grandfather.
What brings you here?

494
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:41,120
Your mother left this with
me yesterday. Here you go.

495
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,820
Damn it, I told her not
to bring stuff like this.

496
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:48,520
- You have it.
- Why would I do that?

497
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,820
Your mother-in-law made this for you
and your husband with love and care!

498
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:55,320
Well, as you can see, we always come
home late, and we always eat bread

499
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,820
for breakfast, so we don't
need side dishes.

500
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,820
Also, nobody eats them.

501
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,620
We'll end up throwing them
out when they go bad anyway.

502
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:06,520
But even so, you can't
just throw food away!

503
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,420
Then you eat it!
Or throw it away!

504
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,320
Um, excuse me!
Ji Hoon's mother!

505
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:16,620
Oh, geez. I can't just throw
precious food away.

506
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:21,120
I'm sure she'd be quite upset if
she knew her children act this way.

507
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,320
Geez, this makes me so worried.

508
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:33,520
Oh, Ms. Mi Ri. I called because
I was worried about you.

509
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,320
- Are you sick?
- I'm just whatever.

510
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,120
I feel humiliated that I
fell for his act like an idiot

511
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,320
so I don't want to come to work.

512
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,520
But still, you can't miss work
at a time like this.

513
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,920
<i>Well, isn't this good for you?</i>

514
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:52,120
You can use this in your
employee performance reports.

515
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:55,520
The younger brother lied to me,
and the older brother will fire me...

516
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,420
how charming.

517
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:18,020
Deputy Chief Nam, I printed out the
sales report for the 99 lipsticks.

518
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:24,420
- Good work, Deputy Han.
- Make sure you note the online event.

519
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:27,720
- What?
- Write that I'm responsible

520
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,420
for the sales going up. I'm responsible
for at least half our figures!

521
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:34,520
Of course, Deputy Han. Of course
I'll acknowledge your efforts.

522
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,620
Please cut me some slack,
Deputy Chief Nam.

523
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,520
Sure. Got it.

respect you, right?</i>

<i>Everyone is desperate.</i>

527
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:12,220
<i>And I don't have the right to judge
them based on their desperation.</i>

528
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:20,020
<i>No, nobody in the world can truly judge
the worth of another human being.</i>

- Is it really this person?
- Yes.

- You're not going to regret this?
- I... will not.

<i>Honestly, I don't have the
confidence that I won't regret it.</i>

- Um, you know--
- You'll have to give me allowance now.

No way. This really isn't right.

What happened, Deputy Chief Nam?

549
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:29,820
There's no way this could be.
I didn't write your name there!

00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:38,520
I really believed in you.
Wow. This is too much.

You want me to leave?
Why? Why me?

gave me said "Deputy Han."

- What happened?
- Talk to Chief Ok about it.

- Leave.

us since our first factory was built!

We were even with her as she had Ji Ho
and went to his first birthday party!

President! You really can't do this!

562
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,220
But how long can I keep letting her
slide because of those things?

- I chose Deputy Han.
- Why did you do that?

I told you, I'll leave!
I'll take responsibility!

- And why are you doing that?
- Because I'm the highest-up.

I took a bribe from
another company, too.

You're not the only one
who took it, though.

At any rate, I said I'd
take responsibility

00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,220
so why did you change it
as you pleased?

588
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:12,920
Deputy Chief Nam!
You're the Deputy Chief.

589
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:16,720
How are you going to
raise Woo Joo if you quit?

590
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,120
What about your father?
And your younger brother?

591
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:22,320
What about your family,
who depends on you?

592
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:26,420
Will it really be okay if you leave?

593
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:38,920
No, it won't be. Still, there isn't
a person who'd be okay if they left!

594
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:43,720
It's true that I won't be okay, but
the others won't be okay, either!

595
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:50,020
There isn't a single person
that is okay to just fire!

596
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:45,420
You know, I really thought about what
I did so wrong to be targeted and fired

597
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:48,520
but I did think of something
that I did wrong.

598
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:53,220
Never talking back or complaining
and doing what I was told to do.

599
00:48:53,220 --> 00:49:04,120
Having the best interest of the company
at heart and never using vacation days.

600
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:10,720
And giving up my paid-for vacation
for my 10-year anniversary here to work.

601
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,120
And all that has led me to this.

602
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:19,120
On the other hand, someone else is
a sexual harasser and is still here.

603
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:23,920
Listen, Deputy Han. I'm a part
of the company's royal family.

604
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:28,120
You should have a conscience. How could
you think to drag me down with you?

605
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:51,120
Deputy Han. I'm so sorry
for being so powerless.

606
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:54,420
I'm so, so sorry.

607
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:04,420
I had to work without
talking back even once.

608
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:14,320
And I still can't say anything
even as I leave. How cruel, really.

609
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:20,120
Here's a gift.

610
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,820
I'll be going, then.

611
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:56,620
<i>A company that just casts aside someone
who'd been a comrade just yesterday.</i>

612
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:00,720
<i>And me, who can
only stand and watch</i>

613
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:05,720
<i>as my comrade is taken from
us due to the power of money.</i>

614
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:12,420
<i>Is it really right to
live my life like this?</i>

615
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:26,520
How can you just quit
without any notice?

616
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:30,720
I mean, I just wanted to
take better care of Ji Ho...

617
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,320
Why do you need to worry
about that, when I'm around?

618
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:37,420
Are you doing this because I complained
a few times about watching him?

619
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:40,920
- No, it's not that.
- Oh, whatever.

620
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,220
Go back to your company and
take back your resignation letter.

621
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:49,020
- How am I supposed to do that?
- We have so many expenses right now.

622
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:50,920
Do you think things will be okay with me
being the only one earning money?

623
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:53,820
Yes, child. How could he
manage that on his own?

624
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:57,020
Don't worry about Ji Ho, and
take back your resignation letter.

625
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,120
Um, Mother, can't I take some time off?

626
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:09,020
I've been working since I graduated
college, and I'm so worn out.

627
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:14,120
You know, I had to start working again
100 days after I gave birth to Ji Ho.

628
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:18,220
I'm so overwhelmed with
issues at home and at work.

629
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:21,220
I'm going to take some
time off for the time being. Okay?

630
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:23,620
Honey. You think you're the
only one who wants to relax?

631
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:28,020
- I want to, too!
- And you do, when you get home!

632
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:33,320
You take weekends and holidays off.
But this is my second job!

633
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,320
Do you know that?

634
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:40,320
Wow, someone would think
that all I do is boss you around!

635
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:44,620
Hey, you have to earn as much as
you can while you're still young!

636
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:48,220
Geez, seriously.
She has no conscience.

637
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:50,520
Are you trying to put him through
more than you already have?

638
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:54,720
Oh, I'm oh-so sorry

639
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:59,120
for being a terrible daughter-in-law
who just makes your son suffer.

640
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:05,420
But you know, I can't just take
back my resignation letter. I got fired.

641
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,920
- What?
- I got fired.

642
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:12,420
I was one of the people they
fired during the restructuring.

643
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:16,020
- Oh my.
- I held on for as long as I could.

644
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:20,120
So let me just breathe
a little now, okay?

645
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,920
Who is it?

646
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,120
Manager Yang!

647
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:56,920
Oh, I was wondering what I'd do
if I couldn't see you before I left.

648
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:59,420
Why did you submit your
resignation letter all of a sudden?

649
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:02,420
I suffered because I trusted you when
you said not to trust Director Kim

650
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:04,320
and I ended up getting stabbed
in the back for that in the end.

651
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:07,520
I don't have any residual
feelings here anymore.

652
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,520
Oh, really? Where are you going, then?

653
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,520
Well, I don't want to tell you just yet.

654
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,420
But I'll give you a call
when I get settled over there.

655
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:17,120
Goodbye.

656
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:24,120
He doesn't look like someone
who just got backstabbed, though.

657
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:28,120
Thank you.
Thank you!

658
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:38,020
Wow, so fast!
Thank you, CEO Lee!

659
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:45,020
All right.
It's your turn this time.

660
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:50,720
<i>[Contract to be on Executive Board]</i>

661
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:08,520
I finally feel like our company
is making its mark!

662
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:12,720
It's truly an honor
to be able to serve you.

663
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:16,720
Please take care of me, President Jo.

664
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,820
Hello, Deputy Chief Nam.

665
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:47,820
What great weather we're having.
It seems like it's getting warmer soon.

666
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:53,520
Oh, want me to make you some
iced coffee to cool you down?

667
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:56,020
- Sure, Ms. Mi Ri.
- What about you, Deputy Park?

668
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,920
- Sure.
- What about you, Deputy Han--

669
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:08,220
<i>The space that we cut away
in order for us to survive</i>

670
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:11,720
<i>left a more deep, residual
pain that we'd expected.</i>

671
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:19,520
<i>But we had to bury that pain in our
hearts and live with what we did.</i>

672
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,920
Yes, I sent the estimate via email.
Please check it.

673
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,020
As for the meeting, shall we plan it
for three days from today?

674
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:27,220
Yes. Yes, I understand.

675
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:29,820
Um, Deputy Han!

676
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:41,220
<i>Have we grown stronger, or weaker?</i>

677
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:45,920
Mi Ri, Mi Ri, Jang Mi Ri, I'm so sorry.
What I did was terrible.

678
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,720
I'm so sorry, Ms. Mi Ri.

679
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,420
I'm sorry.

680
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:04,620
Mi Ri, Mi Ri, Jang Mi Ri.
Hi there.

681
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:10,020
Ms. Mi Ri!
Wait up!

682
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:15,120
Bong Gi, Bong Gi, Nam Bong Gi.
Bye.

683
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:28,420
You were the one who kicked me out,
so why do you want to see me?

684
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:32,720
I'm sure saying something
like this now is futile, but

685
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:36,720
the one who gave your name
to the President wasn't me.

686
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:41,220
At any rate, I'm so sorry that
I couldn't protect you.

687
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:45,020
I already know that I was
being targeted from the start.

688
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:50,920
I know it wasn't you who
did that, so don't be sorry.

689
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:55,420
Geez. It sure is fun to tease you
for the first time in a while.

690
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:04,520
And having time off isn't
as bad as I thought.

691
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:09,720
I reflected on why I lived
such a stressful life before

692
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:16,020
and I can play with my son all I want.
I can even make my husband breakfast.

693
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:22,220
So don't you live like that. Living
like that isn't all there is to life.

694
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:28,220
So you're going to take some
time off for the time being?

695
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:34,520
But even so, I guess I'm not all bad.
I've been getting some offers.

696
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:40,220
That's great. You are skilled, so you'll
be fine no matter where you go.

697
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:45,520
- But, um, where is that, exactly?
- Don't worry about it.

698
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,120
It's not a huge place.
It's pretty small.

699
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,720
When's your first day there?

700
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:56,520
I'm thinking about starting there
after playing for another week.

701
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:59,820
That's a relief.
Congrats, Deputy Han.

702
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:01,920
Thanks, Deputy Chief Nam.

703
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:07,120
Oh yeah. I almost forgot.
I came to bring this to you.

704
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,920
What's this?

705
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:16,520
Geez, when did you have
the time to set this aside?

706
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:20,520
Geez, you sure do have a
knack for looking out for others.

707
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:23,520
- That's all I know how to do, though.
- Don't belittle that.

708
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,020
Don't you know what a
difficult thing that is to do?

709
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:30,320
Who in their right mind would
submit their own name to be fired?

710
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,720
Are you an idiot?

711
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:39,620
<i>Be happy no matter where
you go, Deputy Han.</i>

712
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:45,320
<i>Perhaps what we did was just
to make each other feel relieved</i>

713
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:55,120
<i>to try and pretend to overcome
this well, by acting like adults.</i>

714
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,220
<i>And that's what we did, but...</i>

715
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:02,720
Here's the additional
information from the HSN.

716
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:08,720
Great. What about the preparations to
have our product in the duty-free store?

717
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:12,420
The interior is all finished, and all we
need to do is set up the displays.

718
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:13,920
- What about e-commerce?
- Oh, yes.

719
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,020
We've been getting lots of complaints
about the current delivery service

720
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:17,520
so we're thinking about
switching to another one.

721
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:20,420
- You take care of that.
- Yes, ma'am.

722
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:30,720
Hey, do I look okay? Huh?
I look good, right?

723
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:34,620
Come on, hold it properly!
Yes, like that.

724
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:02,520
CEO Lee.
Welcome to Lovely.

725
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:13,020
Let's plan an event for the day
that the duty-free shop opens.

726
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:14,720
- Yes.
- Yes, ma'am.

727
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:19,420
Chief Ok. Deputy Chief Nam.
Come out here, everyone.

728
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:20,520
I have someone
I want to introduce you to.

729
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:45,320
All right, say hello.
He's an investor of our company

730
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:50,020
and a head director at our company
