Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss,
Your Honor.

172
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:59,860
The girls have been in
my care at the Institute

173
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,029
since they were
found 87 days ago.

174
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,199
And how would you
define their progress?

175
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:09,678
Solid, and astoundingly fast.
If I may?

176
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:16,146
Your Honor,
Victoria and Lilly Desange

177
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,551
were found in
deplorable conditions,

178
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:24,557
isolated, starved. They feared and
distrusted all physical contact.

179
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:29,828
Their emotional growth was clearly
compromised by their abandonment.

180
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:32,232
In order to survive
such extreme isolation,

181
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:34,735
the girls created
an imaginary guardian,

182
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:39,336
a parent figure to feed them,
sing to them, protect them.

183
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,746
They called her "Mama."

184
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:48,414
Victoria and Lilly have a real
chance at a normal life now.

185
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,715
With the right care, physical
and emotional development,

186
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:55,657
and much-needed love and
affection, they will get better.

187
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:57,557
Thank you, Dr. Dreyfuss.

188
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:00,893
Miss Podolski, would you
care to address the court?

189
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:01,952
Good morning, Your Honor.

190
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:04,428
Jeffrey Desange
murdered my niece

191
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:06,797
and abandoned his
daughters in the forest.

192
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:09,099
Now, his brother did
an extraordinary thing.

193
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:11,537
Lucas never gave
up on his nieces,

194
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:14,277
but he did it for the girls,
not for himself.

195
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:16,879
So if he still has their
best interest at heart,

196
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,180
he must know that neither his
salary nor his very small apartment

197
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:22,377
are suitable for
the raising of two children,

198
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,682
let alone two children
with very special needs.

199
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,143
How many kids have
you raised, Jean?

200
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:27,589
About as many as you, Lucas.

201
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:31,021
Of course she wants
the girls, Lucas.

202
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,527
Stand in her shoes
for a second.

203
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:36,064
She can't just sweep in and take them.
They're not hers to take.

204
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:38,065
I'm not sure
that's entirely fair.

205
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:41,730
I'll tell you what's not fair. It's not
fair that she gets to buy my nieces.

206
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,764
Would it really be
such a bad thing?

207
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,035
What?

208
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:50,470
Annabel plays in a band. You
draw pictures for a living.

209
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:54,244
The way you live, do you have
room for children in your life?

210
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:55,376
I mean, really?

211
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:57,681
What are you saying, Gerald?

212
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,850
When it comes to
the girls' welfare,

213
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:05,360
the family court judge is pretty much
obliged to act on my recommendation.

214
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:08,159
And right now, I'd be
lying if I didn't say

215
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,530
it was a slam dunk
for Miss Podolski.

216
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,301
But the truth is,

217
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,134
I don't want them living on
the other side of the country

218
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,730
any more than you do.

219
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:22,845
So, we can really, really help
each other out right now.

220
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:27,907
You want the girls, I need
continued access to them.
