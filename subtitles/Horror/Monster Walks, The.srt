What will happen to that child?

17
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,560 
She will become a slave and property of local government in Yeongjo.

I am uneasy about leaving Yang Sun alive.

21
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,990 
This could be a trap.

22
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,620 
It it too dangerous for you to do it yourself.

23
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:01,760 
If she is a local government slave that is under the Defense Minister's jurisdiction, there should be a way to get her out.

24
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,250 
I will find out.

25
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,510

53
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:45,160 
All of the dead, took the medicine

to protect the Crown Prince without any hesitation.

55
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,720 
There are too many people being sacrificed.

56
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,370 
After I heard the story of Gwi from the prior King,

57
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,210 
I vowed to get rid of him and

58
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,530 
protect the country and its people.

59
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:08,360 
But I still haven't even been able to make an attempt to get rid of him and reached this age,

We have that person.

63
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,370 
The one who woke the Royal Concubine's body.

64
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,540 
That another vampire.

65
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,030 
I really believe that person is,

66

helping us in secret.

What are your thoughts on this matter, Crown Prince?

71
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:27,110 
I believe your statement is right a thousand and ten thousand times over.

72
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,470 
<i>We believe you are right.</i>

73
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:34,420 
<i>The Crown Prince is definitely the Lustful Student.</i>

74
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,020 
So if give me just one more chance--

75
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,050 
Stop.

76
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,180 
STOP!

77
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:45,390 
The dead Lustful Student said he handed the memorandum over to someone else.

78
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,660 
So what do you think will happen...

79
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,860 
if it is Kim Seong Yeol?

80
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,800 
Are you saying you believe that old bookseller's words?

81
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,840 
He can't be the Lustful Student!

82
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:02,860 
All this is the King's trick to protect the Crown Prince.

83
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,430 
What if it is not a trick?

84
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,910 
Have you called for me?

85
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:17,790 
You may leave now Prime Minister.

86
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,110 
I have something to discuss with this child.

87
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,810 
I have an idea to bring Kim Seong Yeol sooner?

88
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,700 
Do you have any idea?

89
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:52,270 
No I don't with my limited knowledge.

Love affair with a human woman.

91
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:59,100 
I can't believe he's doing this reckless act.

92
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,130 
Keep an eye on the daughter of that dead bookseller.

93
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,160 
Around that daughter,

94
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,990 
Kim Sung Yeol will be there.

95
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,980 
I will do as you command.

96
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,120 
You're so lucky.

97
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,600 
The traitors' families even get to live.

98
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,890 
If you even want to eat grass to live, you should work until you die!

99
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,090 
Whether they are the secret plan or are related to the secret plan,

100
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,990 
I don't know. <br> But,

101
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,000 
Crown Prince Sadong

102
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,040 
must have found the secret plan by following them.

103
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,800 
If the secret plan to get rid of Gwi is a human,

104
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,400 
does that mean they are stronger than Gwi?

105
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,200 
I also don't know that either.

106
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:08,540 
Lee Hyo Yeon, Choi Hyeong Gyu, Jeong Geum Ok...

107
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:12,530 
They all have different family roots and levels.

108
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,670 
You go find the person who was in charge of the family registry from 120 years ago.

109
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,430 
If we track their whereabouts,

110
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,720 
we'll be able to find out how they are related.

111
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,290 
Yes, my Lord.

112
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,820 
How is the Crown Prince doing?

113
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,360 
According to the Defense Minister, the Crown Prince

114
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,450 
has become a completely different person.

115
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,390 
He is siding with the Noron and firing the officials from Soron side.

116
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,850 
Even the scholar No Hak Young who was framed and released,

117
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,380 
got fired by the Crown Prince himself.

118
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,570 
What is the Crown Prince's schedule today?

119
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,670 
I will look around quietly

120
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:02,060 
so tell them not to make any unnecessary preparations.

121
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,940 
Yes, Your Highness.

122
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:07,190 
Gwi will watch you.

123
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,390 
You have to make everyone believe that the Crown Prince has changed.

124
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:15,410 
How my powerless act can bring a devastation,

125
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,870 
I learned it the hard way.

126
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,670 
Until I can gather all the power,

127
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,800 
I will wait.

128
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,020 
What is it?

129
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,800 
I was waiting because I had something I needed to check with you.

130
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,340 
Did you really,

131
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,500 
officials from the Soron side and the Sungkyunkwan professors,

132
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,190 
send a petition to the King to exile those people?

133
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,050 
Why to a former official,

134
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,780 
do I need to explain that?

135
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:03,930 
The Lustful Student that you served...is dead.

136
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:07,800 
I'll look over this once thinking of our past relationship,

137
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,930 
Don't do this kind of rash and thoughtless action ever again.

138
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:19,240 
Go down the path you chose by only looking at the future.

139
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:23,840 
Everyone says that the Crown Prince has changed,

140
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:28,440 
but I don't believe it.

141
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,130 
Kicking me out like this,

142
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:35,210 
keeping Jo Yang Sun as a slave,

143
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,160 
I'm sure that you have a reason for doing so.

144
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,810 
I...will always wait for Your Highness

145
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,410 
in the same place.

146
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:52,640 
Until we see each other again, stay strong.

147
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,550 
Clean it up quickly!

148
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,540

have committed a sin towards me that cannot be washed away.

With the heart that is sorry towards me,

save the nation and its people.

158

Because that's what the Lustful Student should do.

00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,970 
and treasure yourself.

168
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,850 
Have I seen such a crazy woman? <br> This precious salt!

169
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,750 
What are you doing? Pick it up quickly!

170
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:56,090 
Kim Sung Yeol is not next to that child,

171
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,110 
the Crown Prince is.

172
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,850 
Isn't she an amazing child?

173
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,650 
I heard this is very fertile land in Pyongyang.

174
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,720 
It's not even another slave, but trying to take out the Lustful Student's daughter

175
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,250 
is not an easy task. <br> You know that as well.

176
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,170 
I will never forget your grace.

177
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:33,580 
<i>I will hand over the slave document right away,</i>

178
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,970 
so you can take her at a proper time.

179
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:48,030 
But, I heard that you often drink with the Prime Minister

180
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,930 
so I planned to give him greetings.

181
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,730 
But he is not visiting.

182
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,020 
Don't even talk about it.

183
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:00,530 
The Prime Minister and his daughter don't have an ordinary relationship.

184
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:04,710 
The Prime Minister won't have much time.

185
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,520 
If you say they are not ordinary...

186
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:14,300 
There is no other perfect relationship than their father and daughter relationship.

187
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,660 
<i>Actually at the time he became a lowly government official, he was at a country province.</i>

188
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,260 
But he got promoted to the Prime Minister in very short time.

189
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,400 
<i>There were a lot of rumors.</i>

190
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,560 
He was the head of his fallen family.

191
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,160 
And In an effort to try raise his family up

192
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,710 
he gave his one and only daughter

193
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,950 
to the higher ranking person, according to the rumor.

194
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:37,940 
Another rumor is that his wife's illness is due to that.

195
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,240 
What did the Elder say?

196
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:02,210 
You can't even recognize your father, so how could you be a princess?

197
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,860 
Don't even dream about it.

198
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:12,830 
The Crown Prince will be de-crowned by me anyway.

199
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,040 
What are you talking about?

200
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,790 
Why?

201
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,760 
Those words reach your ears?

202
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,150 
I asked you what are you talking about.

203
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:29,020 
The Crown Prince is the Lustful Student who is trying to get rid of Gwi.

204
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,780 
It's certain.

205
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:39,210 
I will show the evidence to the Elder soon and have the Crown Prince kneel in front of me.

206
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,600 
<i> Don't even talk about it.</i>

207
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,950 
<i>There is no other perfect relationship than their father and daughter relationship. The one child and only daughter,</i>

208
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:54,090 
<i>he gave her to the higher ranking person according to the rumor.</i>

209
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:58,390 
<i>Another rumor is that his wife's illness is due to that.</i>

210
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,420 
You saw for yourself?

211
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,310 
Yes.

212
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:35,770 
She looked very weak mentally and physically.

213
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:39,340 
-and-<br>-What is it? Is she in danger?

214
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:43,130 
And an impressive character met that daughter.

215
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,330 
Who are you talking about?

216
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:48,590 
It seems you are very interested in that woman.

217
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,800 
It was the Crown Prince.

218
00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:02,050 
I don't know what the relationship is between the high Crown Prince and a mere slave girl

219
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:05,370 
but they shared quite a long talk.

220
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,330 
You need to make up for the salt thrown away.

221
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:24,890 
Move all of it into the storage before the sun rises tomorrow.

222
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:30,910 
If there is even one left when I return tomorrow, you won't get fed for three days.

223
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:36,110 
<i>Father... I have to endure through this, don't I? I should stay alive, right?</i>

224
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:43,320 
<i> Live...I need to live...because I need to take care of Dam Yi and mother.</i>

225
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,540 
<i> Because I have to do father's worth too.</i>

226
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:00,550 
Hey, young lady. <br> Are you okay?

227
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,670 
Aigoo.

228
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,950 
Are you okay?

229
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,520 
Aigoo...what should we do?

230
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:23,320 
Why are you out here by yourself?

231
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,920 
To give to Hye Ryeong...

232
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,480 
I planted a lot of wild flowers here.

233
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,460 
Someone pulled them all out.

234
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,020 
I saw them and saw them again.

235
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:41,360 
They must have all been taken away.

236
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:50,330 
I wanted to show it to our Hye Ryeong when she came.

237
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:57,140 
She would've liked it a lot if she saw it.

238
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:01,820 
Escort her inside.

239
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,410 
Yes, Miss.

240
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:07,900 
Let's go.

241
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,050 
Let's go.

242
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,490 
Where is Hye Ryeong?

243
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:20,460 
You haven't seen Hye Ryeong?

244
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,790 
There are a few tens of people named Jung Choon Soo.

245
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:48,790 
And if you find all the peoples' names written in the memorandum, there will be over a few hundreds.

246
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,440 
Something is strange.

247
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:59,370 
There's no way the Crown Prince would leave such an ambiguous clue.

248
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:43,720 
Is this the secret plan?

249
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:50,450 
<i>The maternal relation, The befitting Royal's will and the Guardian Gwi?</i>

250
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:53,750 
What do you think this means?

251
00:26:53,750 --> 00:27:00,210 
<i> It was a human that called Gwi out. <br> Kicking him out also cannot be done without a human's help.</i>

252
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:03,590 
<i> To the King who submitted to Gwi because he was greedy for the throne,</i>

253
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:07,560 
<i>there was nothing I could help with.</i>

254
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:16,560 
<i>I am a guardian gwi existing only to get rid of that vampire who broke the rules.</i>

255
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,980 
<i>What did you do to me?</i>

256
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:21,390 
<i>Take my ability...</i>

257
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:26,420 
<i>And you will become the one and only vampire that can compete against Gwi.</i>

258
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,650 
The befitting Royal...

259
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:36,900 
The Crown Prince and I are one of the secret plan to get rid of Gwi.

260
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,690 
You want to take the family member of a traitor?

261
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:58,370 
Can't you tell by the Defense Minister's hand written letter and the slave document?

262
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:03,630 
Ah that Jo...where is that Jo?

263
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:06,660 
I think you just wasted your money.

264
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:10,210 
How am I supposed to use some girl who is pretty much dead?

265
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:12,820 
What does that mean?

266
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,080 
Here.

267
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,620 
Aigoo!<br> Aigoo...aigoo!

268
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:24,080 
Snap out of it!

269
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,600 
Can you hear my voice?

270
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,250 
Look here. Endure it for a bit.

271
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:40,150 
Then what does the maternal relation mean?

272
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:44,740 
Perhaps they are connected in maternal relations?

273
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:48,240 
If so, then they can have different last names and the family roots.

274
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:56,040 
If so, if we find who's mother that is, then we can find the clue to get rid of Gwi.

275
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:03,010 
First, I'll have to meet with the Crown Prince.

276
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:05,400 
My Lord!

277
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,140 
My Lord!

278
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,130 
What happened?

279
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:12,900 
I don't think there will be any use taking her to a doctor.

280
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,980 
She's barely alive, my Lord.

281
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,170 
Let her down.

282
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,530 
Prepare the bathtub and hot water.

283
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:35,190 
Stop.

284
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,810 
Don't get involved.

285

310
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:58,170 
Mother.

311
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,200 
What are you doing right now?

312
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:41,490 
I asked, what were you doing?

313
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:44,200 
For the Lustful Student who lost his life not too long ago

314
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,250 
and his followers, I was praying for them to reincarnate in paradise

315
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:56,760 
Praying for the afterlife of criminals?

316
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:03,820 
Do you even know how dangerous your actions are?

317
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,540 
To satisfy those who died painfully and with regrets,

318
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:10,370 
praying for the safety of their families that are alive,

319
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:12,150 
is it wrong?

320
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,960 
Why are you doing that?

321
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,530 
<i> I asked to do it.</i>

322
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,500 
While trying to help me,

323
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,410 
You've been scolded without fault

324
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:32,690 
I'm sorry.

325
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:34,650 
Not at all.

326
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:45,710 
I thought of Crown Prince Sadong.

327
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:51,240 
I heard that they were people who follow his teachings.

328
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:55,760 
Do you know what father's wishes are?

329
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:02,730 
Did you already know?

330
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:06,440 
I did.

331
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:09,810 
I, too wanted to continue his wishes-

332
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,610 
Wait a moment.

333
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:17,530 
Crown Prince... are you Lustful Student?

334
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,520 
Please tell me that you are not.

335
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,540 
Tell me that not!

336
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,970 
Can I

337
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:33,940 
rest next to you for just one night, Mother?

338
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:41,550 
It has been long since I haven't been able to sleep.

339
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:48,820 
I wish to sleep, please.

340
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,870 
<i>The Crown Prince is Lustful Student.</i>

341
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,920 
Why do you keep going to the sanctuary?

342
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:16,570 
If he meets you at the choosing of the Crown Princess, he will say that you purposely approached him

343
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:25,250 
Did I allow you to ask questions?

344
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,330 
Forgive me, Lady.

345
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:31,250 
<i>Approached him on purpose...</i>

346
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:33,950 
<i>I have to make sure he doesn't think so.</i>

347
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:39,900 
There is something you have to do for a moment.

348
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,440 
You face is cold.

349
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:51,000 
I... will make it warm for you.

350
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,070 
If you come here,

351
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,620 
I will make it warm.

352
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,760 
Don't leave.

353
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:38,980 
Like this...

354
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:42,920 
Just by my side...

355
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:47,220 
Stay, please.

356
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,770 
I will not leave.

357
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,160 
I like you

358
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:19,910 
so much, Scholar.

359
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:30,940 
I love you.

360
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:40,760

is up to here.

370
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:35,130 
There is no future...<br>♫<i> I want to become the rain <i>♫</i></i>

397
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,220 
She'll wake up tomorrow.

398
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:05,560 
Tell that to her family and prepare a ship on time.

399
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,370 
Do you really...

400
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:11,030 
have to send her off?

401
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:16,180 
I am ignorant and have no sense, but I can also see it.

402
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:19,670 
As much as you risk your life for her...

403
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,990 
she's in your heart.

404
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:22,920 
Ho Jin.

405
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:27,560 
You lived like a dead person for 120 years.

406
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,080 
Now...

407
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,460 
isn't it time for you to be happy?

408
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:36,110 
Finding the secret plan and getting rid of Gwi...

409
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:39,310 
is the one and only reason I have to be alive for.

410
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:42,870 
After that's over, I, too...

411
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:47,270 
will disappear from the human world.

412
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:05,740 
The memorial that my husband asked for,

413
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:09,250 
take care of it well, Monk.

414
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:11,390 
Your husband

415
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:14,320 
will have gone to a good place.

416
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,280 
Yes, Monk.

417
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:20,370 
He's someone who has never done something bad in his whole life.

418
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:22,420 
He must have been taken away well.

419
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:27,880 
The husband and wife's good deeds will reach to heaven.

420
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:31,870 
Taking in and raising someone else's child as his own

421
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:36,660 
and never once forgetting that child's parents' memorial for 10 years

422
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,150 
isn't something easy.

423
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:42,010 
What are you talking about?

424
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:46,910 
Yang Sun isn't of blood relation to her father?

425
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:48,910 
Then perhaps...

426
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:52,600 
she is the child of Seo Jung Do my husband had been memorializing?

427
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,420 
Is that what you are saying?

428
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,700 
<i>Father.</i>

429
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:13,500 
Unni, you're okay, right?

430
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,420 
Unni...

431
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,630 
<i>Father, it hurts!</i>

432
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,410 
Unni!

433
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,480 
Unni!

434
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:38,800 
Unni.

435
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:43,170 
Thank you for coming back. Thank you, Unni.

436
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:45,880 
I'm sorry.

437
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:49,920 
Only I lived...

438
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:54,150 
I couldn't protect Father...

439
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,340 
I'm sorry, Dam.

440
00:44:57,050 --> 00:45:01,570 
Why are you sorry? What did you do wrong?

441
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:05,730 
I'm sorry.

442
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,900 
I'm sorry.

443
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:12,630 
I'm sorry.

444
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:16,460 
Let's leave Hanyang.

445
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:20,390 
Let's go to Tamna where no one knows us and live on our own.

446
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:24,140 
Scholar said he'd send us there today.

447
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:27,160 
Scholar?

448
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:32,430 
What do we do if the Crown Prince submitted to Gwi?

449
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:38,120 
What if he tells Gwi that you have the secret plan?

450
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,990 
I still have to confirm it.

451
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:44,510 
To see if the Crown Prince still has the desire to get rid of Gwi.

452
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:51,350 
The Crown Prince is also one of the secret plans to get rid of Gwi.

453
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:55,870 
About Jo...

454
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:57,700 
Just...

455
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:00,510 
if she leaves now, you don't even know when you'll see her.

456
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:04,320 
Are you really going to send her off without seeing her face even once?

457
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:12,490 
Until I leave, escort her well.

458
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:24,070 
<i>Crown Prince Junghyun's Memorandum.</i>

459
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:32,430 
Hey.

460
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:37,330 
The weather is unbelievable.

461
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:41,330 
The heavens are even helping you be able to leave peacefully.

462
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:45,610 
I came to see the Scholar.

463
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:46,550 
About that...

464
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:48,530 
He left early at dawn.

465
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:51,230 
He told me to

466
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:53,320 
make sure you were escorted off well.

467
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,590 
Is he going somewhere?

468
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:58,410 
Can I find him?

469
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:03,290 
Far away...he went to the countryside.

470
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,990 
Let's hurry and go. Soo Hyang will escort your mother.

471
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:12,810 
Let's go.

472
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:46,590 
I'll ask you one thing.

473
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:48,820 
Speak.

474
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:52,620 
About the noble my husband had been memorializing,

475
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:57,240 
Seo Jeong Do. Was he an amazing person?

476
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:01,920 
He was closely serving the Crown Prince Sadong and a professor of Sungkyunkwan.

477
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,780 
When the Crown Prince was killed ten-years ago,

478
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:08,850 
He was accused as well, and died.

479
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:14,870 
If the Father was a criminal...

480
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:19,210 
the child must also be like that.

481
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:32,780 
Are we going to Tamna now?

482
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,530 
Mother is here.

483
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,300 
Mother.

484
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:45,680 
Mother!

485
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:48,830 
Why am I your mother?

486
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:51,530 
Do we share blood?

487
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:54,780 
Why am I your mother?

488
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:57,280 
It's enough that you killed Dam Yi's father like that.

489
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,110 
Who else are you going to kill that you show your face?

490
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:02,800 
Who else are you going to kill!

491
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,360 
What are you?

492
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,370 
What are you!

493
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:08,820 
Mother, why are you like this?

494
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,850 
What did she do wrong?

495
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:12,930 
Stop it!

496
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:29,180 
I...

497
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:31,830 
did wrong.

498
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:34,710 
I did wrong.

499
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:37,240 
Shut up.

500
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:41,780 
I don't even want to see you anymore, so don't appear in front of me ever again.

501
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:45,720 
If we have to leave with this child...

502
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,060 
we will stay here.

503
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:50,590 
Mother, why are you like this?

504
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:54,760 
You said that if Unni came back, we'd go to Tamna and live well together.

505
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,800 
You said that!

506
00:49:58,380 --> 00:49:59,580 
Aigoo.

507
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:02,560 
Do you think you will feel comfortable if you leave Yang Sun and go?

508
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:06,000 
Let's get on the boat first.

509
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,500 
I don't want to! Did you not hear?!

510
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:11,810 
She's...

511
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:15,380 
not my child.

512
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:18,080 
She's...

513
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,450 
not my husband's child either.

514
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,320 
Mother.

515
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:30,050 
Why am I not Father's child?

516
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:31,960 
Why?

517
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:38,380 
Your real father is a dead man named Seo Jeong Do.

518
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:43,710 
What situation do you want to arise from being attached to us as a criminal's daughter

519
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:47,090 
Go...

520
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:52,000 
Please go!

521
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:31,250 
Show yourself.

522
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,630 
What's your identity? You're not a human, huh?

523
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:51,920 
Yes. I'm a...

524
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,960 
vampire.

525
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:05,050 
120 years ago, I lived as Crown Prince Junghyun's friend and I became a vampire.

526
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:07,550 
My name is Kim Sung Yeol.

527
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:13,460 
10 years ago, your father, Crown Prince Sadong,

528
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:17,550 
told me the sceret plan to get rid of Gwi is a human.

529
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:22,820 
Not so long ago, I recieved this book.

530
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:32,480 
What's your reason for coming to me and showing me this book?

531
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:37,130 
It's to check your determination.

532
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:14,960 
I will give you this memorandum.

533
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,670 
Your Highness, His Majesty is looking for you.

534
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:40,330 
What is it?

535
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:45,580 
Big trouble, sir. You should go there quickly.

536
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:59,070 
If you want to go, you have to get on the boat right now.

537
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:11,500 
I won't go, Mother.

538
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:15,290 
Unni, no. <br>I want to go with you.

539
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:28,130 
When you become comfortable seeing me

540
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:31,460 
then I will go to you.

541
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:34,670 
Stay healthy.

542
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:47,000 
Only send my Mother and sister.

543
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:50,540 
I ask you.

544
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:55,460 
You might get dragged off to be a slave again, so

545
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:58,790 
leave together.

546
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:08,230 
Sis, where are you going? If you're not going I'm not going either!

547
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:45,960 
What happened?

548
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:48,540 
They went without Yang Sun.

549
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:55,130 
She says Yang Sun is not her child. <br> She says that child is

550
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:58,610 
the one you saved, the bloodline of Seo Jeong Do.

551
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:02,710 
Did you know?

552
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:05,170 
Where's Yang Sun?

553
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:08,020 
I don't know.

554
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:12,270 
<i>Subtitles brought to you by The Hot BloodSuckers Team @ Viki</i>

555
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:37,580 
That's right.

556
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:40,580 
I will get rid of Gwi my way.

557
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:47,160 
Are you saying there's a way to get rid of Gwi without the memorandum?

558
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:52,960 
There should be a way, so forget about the memorandum now.

559
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,660 
Can the Prince become the King?

560
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:16,960 
My Father says the Crown Prince is the Lustful Student.

561
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:23,750 
If that's true, he can't get the throne.

562
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:28,960 
How can I give the guy who wanted to kill me my throne?

563
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:35,710 
You look worried.

564
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:38,510 
Are you worried about the Prince?

565
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:44,040 
Whether he becomes the King or not, it doesn't matter to me.

566
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:48,630 
All I want is the seat next to the King.

567
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:03,790 
My mother lost her mind because of that

568
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:08,630 
and there's only one thing I thought about when I endured those long years.

569
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:13,790 
To stand on a higher position than my father...

570
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:28,710 
That's the reason I have to be the King's woman.

571
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:34,830 
If a smart child like you were the Queen, I wouldn't have to worry.

572
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:39,210 
When I see you, I remember a woman.

573
00:58:39,210 --> 00:58:42,870 
She was as smart as you

574
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:45,210 
and had big ambitions.

575
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:49,500 
Was she your lover?

576
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:51,710 
I liked her.

577
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:56,790 
It was the first time I shared feelings with a human.

578
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:01,170 
What happened to her?

579
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:03,670 
I killed her.

580
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,630 
There was no other choice.

581
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:15,430 
She had my child without my permission.

582
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:22,960 
Since long ago, there was a story that said a a baby born between a human and vampire can kill a vampire.

583
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,580 
What happened to the child?

584
00:59:29,890 --> 00:59:32,250 
The child probably died already.

585
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:36,290 
That happened over 200 years ago.

586
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:01,130 
<i> Unni, are we really going to Tamna tomorrow?</i>

587
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:02,670 
<i>Of course!</i>

588
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:05,130 
<i>When we get there, we'll get your leg recovered.</i>

589
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:12,530 
<i>Father, let's live only eating the fish that Dam Yi gets.</i>

590
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:17,420 
<i>Aigoo, we're going to live in luxury thanks to our daughter!</i>

591
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:22,670 
<i>Mother you just laughed, right?</i>

592
01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:24,670 
<i>I heard too! She laughed.</i>

593
01:00:24,670 --> 01:00:28,240 
<i>Even I heard her laughing.<i></i></i>

594
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:34,120 
<i>Eat and sleep already. We have to leave early tomorrow.</i>

595
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:37,960 
<i>Yeah yeah, do as your Mother says.</i>

596
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:42,250 
<i>But, she really did laugh.</i>

597
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:47,170 
<br>

598
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:58,290 
<i> No... No... Father...</i>

599
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:03,160 
<i>Father, wake up.</i>

600
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:05,250 
<i>Let's go home.</i>

601
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:09,610 
<i>Mother and Dam Yi are waiting.</i>

602
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:26,250 
<i>You killed Dam Yi's father already. Who are you trying to kill now?!</i>
