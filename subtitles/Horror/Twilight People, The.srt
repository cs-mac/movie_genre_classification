1
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:00,689
"These violent delights
have violent ends,

2
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:05,256
"and in their triumph die,
like fire and powder,

3
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:09,830
"which, as they kiss, consume."

4
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:46,332
Gran?

5
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,320
Edward, don't! She'll see you.

6
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:17,229
Okay.

7
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:29,778
Gran, I'd like you to meet...

8
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,144
Happy birthday, Bella.

9
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,551
Happy birthday.

10
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,957
I thought we agreed, no presents.

11
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,596
Well, the one from me's not wrapped,
so it doesn't count.

12
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:32,070
That's actually great. Thanks, Dad.

13
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:36,346
It goes with this one from your mom.
We coordinated.

14
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,675
Well, she coordinated me.

15
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:44,011
It's to put your pictures
in from senior year.

16
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,719
Senior year.

17
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:52,324
-How'd you get so old so fast?
-I didn't. It's not that old.

18
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:55,192
I don't know. Is that a gray hair?

19
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:57,301
No. No way.

20
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,999
Happy birthday.

21
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,509
That's really funny.

22
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:08,981
<i>Another missing hiker brings
the total to 3 presumed dead.</i>

23
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:10,777
<i>Rangers are searching
for the killer animal...</i>

24
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:16,017
<i>Situation's all critical</i>

25
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,957
<i>You've got to look first before you go</i>

26
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,926
It's Bella. Bella!

27
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:23,852
-Hi.
-I'm...

28
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:28,158
Today's the big day, Bella.

29
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,831
R and J essay due.

30
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:34,300
-Yeah.
-Wherefore art thou, Bella?

31
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:39,309
Let me take a picture of you guys.
My mom wants me to put together, like,

32
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,505
a scrapbook full of memories.

33
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,569
Cool. Yeah.

34
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,013
I take them. I'm not in them.

35
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:44,481
-No, no, no, come here.
-Well, you are today.

36
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,915
You'll photoshop this
if my nose looks big, right?

37
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:49,819
Don't worry, I'm in the picture.
No one will be looking at you guys.

38
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,288
That's good.

39
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:54,050
Good. Cullen's here.

40
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:59,088
Well, talk to you later.

41
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:23,816
-Happy birthday.
-Don't remind me.

42
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:29,152
Bella, your birth is definitely
something to celebrate.

43
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:31,924
-Yeah, but my aging's not.
-Your aging?

44
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:37,065
I think 18 is a little young
to start worrying about that.

45
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:38,763
It's one year older than you.

46
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,363
No, it isn't. I'm 109.

47
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,804
Well, maybe I shouldn't be dating
such an old man.

48
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:48,438
It's gross.
I should be thoroughly repulsed.

49
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,693
-We have to go to class.
-Okay.

50
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,991
Wait a second.

51
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,665
Someone wants you.

52
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,272
-Bella!
-Jacob!

53
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,035
What?

54
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,869
I'll leave you to talk.

55
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,849
Hello, biceps! You know,
anabolic steroids are really bad for you.

56
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:31,319
Well, I'm just filling out, Bella.

57
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,827
You know, it wouldn't seem so drastic
if we hung out more.

58
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:38,229
You should switch schools.
You can come hang out with the palefaces.

59
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:41,733
I'm all right.
I prefer the rez school's exclusivity.

60
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,836
They let any old riffraff into this place.

61
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,797
I see. Then why are you slumming it?

62
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,564
I was just buying a part for the Rabbit.

63
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:52,167
You should really come
take a ride when it's done.

64
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,610
Is it fast?

65
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:56,640
It's decent.

66
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:00,081
-I'm kidding.
-Okay. Good.

67
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,913
Hey, happy birthday.

68
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,651
Your dad told my dad, so...

69
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,261
Yeah, of course he did.

70
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:12,390
I saw this the other day and thought of you.

71
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,763
Catches bad dreams.

72
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,795
That's kind of perfect.

73
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,373
Thank you.

74
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,376
No problem.

75
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:28,739
-Good seeing you.
-Yeah, I'll see you later.

76
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:29,941
Bye.

77
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:35,114
So how come Jacob Black
gets to give you a gift and I don't?

78
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,190
Because I have nothing to give back to you.

79
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:42,693
Bella, you give me everything
just by breathing.

80
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,256
See? Thank you.

81
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,926
-That's all I want.
-Bella!

82
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:51,801
Happy birthday!

83
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:56,601
I thought I said no presents.

84
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,837
I've already seen you open it,
and guess what,

85
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:00,344
you love it.

86
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:03,211
You're gonna wear it tonight. Our place.

87
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:07,943
Come on. Please? It'll be fun.

88
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,957
-Okay. All right.
-Great!

89
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:16,153
Okay, I'll see you at 7:00.

90
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:21,200
Jasper, no fair with the mood control thing.

91
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,328
Sorry, Bella. Happy...

92
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,037
Never mind.

93
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,608
You can't trust vampires. Trust me.

94
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,639
<i>O my love! My wife!</i>

95
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,645
<i>Death, that hath sucked
the honey of thy breath</i>

96
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,153
<i>hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.</i>

97
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:45,187
<i>Thou art not conquered.</i>

98
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:50,561
<i>Beauty's ensign yet is crimson
in thy lips and in thy cheeks.</i>

99
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:54,264
<i>And death's pale flag is not advanced there.</i>

100
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,301
I hate being celebrated.

101
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,938
There are worse tragedies.
I mean, look at Romeo.

102
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,975
Killed his true love out of sheer stupidity.

103
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:05,969
Yeah.

104
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,640
Though I do envy him one thing.

105
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:12,575
Juliet is, like, perfect.

106
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,917
If you like
that obviously beautiful sort of thing.

107
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:22,126
Not the girl, the suicide.

108
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,295
It's nearly impossible for...

109
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,397
For some people.

110
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:38,305
For humans, a little poison,

111
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,404
a dagger to the heart.

112
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,276
There's so many different options.

113
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:51,455
Why would you say that?

114
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,249
Because I had to consider it once.

115
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,488
I didn't know if I'd get to you in time.

116
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:03,295
I had to come up with some kind of plan.

117
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,265
What was the plan?

118
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,797
That I'd go to Italy
and provoke the Volturi.

119
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,873
-The what?
-The Volturi.

120
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:16,403
Now, who'd like to repeat
the last few lines of iambic pentameter

121
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:19,042
just to show they were paying attention?

122
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,851
Mr. Cullen?

123
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,516
Yes, Mr. Berty.

124
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,128
"O here will I set up my everlasting rest

125
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:38,297
"and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
from this world-wearied flesh.

126
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,003
"Eyes, look your last.

127
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,871
"Arms, take your last embrace!

128
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:47,745
"And, lips, O you, the doors of breath,

129
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:52,748
"seal with a righteous kiss a dateless
bargain to engrossing death!"

130
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,080
Eyes on the screen, people.

131
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,090
Thus with a kiss I die.

132
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,661
The Volturi are a very old,
very powerful family.

133
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:11,896
I guess they're the closest thing
to royalty my world has.

134
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,700
-Is that Carlisle?
-Yeah.

135
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:18,103
He lived with them for a few decades.

136
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:22,773
Described them as very refined.
No respect for human life, of course,

137
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:27,152
but a respect for the arts and the sciences,
at least.

138
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,211
And the law.

139
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:32,986
Above all, the law.

140
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:37,991
Vampires have laws?

141
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,159
Not very many.

142
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:45,167
And only one that's regularly enforced.

143
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,140
What is it?

144
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,303
That we keep the existence
of our kind a secret.

145
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:56,806
We don't make spectacles of ourselves,

146
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:01,209
and we don't kill conspicuously.

147
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,592
Unless, of course, you want to die.

148
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,099
You gotta stop talking about that.

149
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:27,942
I can't even think
about someone hurting you.

150
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:34,610
Bella, the only thing that can hurt me
is you.

151
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:39,480
And I don't have anything else
to be afraid of.

152
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:40,616
That's not true.

153
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,825
Victoria? She'll come for me one day.

154
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:51,260
Alice will see when she decides,
and we'll be ready.

155
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,437
I could protect you

156
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:56,169
if you change me.

157
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:59,276
Bella, you already do protect me.

158
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,238
You're my only reason

159
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,647
to stay alive,

160
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:09,150
if that's what I am.

161
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,788
But it's my job to protect you.

162
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:20,457
From everyone except my sister.

163
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,764
It's time! It's time. It's time. It's time!

164
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:26,568
(The Violet Hour)

165
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,267
<i>Your lips are nettles</i>

166
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,400
<i>Your tongue is wine</i>

167
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:34,471
<i>You're left as liquid
But your body's pine</i>

168
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,242
Sorry about all this.

169
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,148
-We tried to rein Alice in.
-As if that were even possible.

170
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,709
-Happy birthday, Bella.
-Thanks.

171
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,659
I found it in your bag. You mind?

172
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,658
Dating an older woman. Hot.

173
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,095
-What?
-You first, Rosalie.

174
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,030
It's a necklace. Alice picked it out.

175
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:02,667
Thanks.

176
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,106
Show me the love.

177
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,807
This one's from Emmett.

178
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,778
Already installed it in your truck.

179
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,290
Finally a decent sound system

180
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,758
-for that piece of...
-Hey! Don't hate the truck.

181
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:25,089
Open Esme and Carlisle's.

182
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,890
Just a little something
to brighten your day.

183
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:31,937
Yes, you've been looking
kind of pale lately.

184
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,276
Paper cut.

185
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:09,098
Jaz, Jaz. It's okay. It's just a little

186
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,841
blood.

187
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,251
Get Jasper out of here.

188
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:29,290
I'm sorry, I can't.

189
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,395
I'll have to stitch this up in my office.

190
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,294
Check on Jasper.

191
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,571
I'm sure he's very upset with himself,

192
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,166
and I doubt he'll listen to anyone
but you right now.

193
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:45,437
Edward.

194
00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:00,381
-I never wanted to have a party.
-It's not your fault.

195
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:06,591
Jasper hasn't been away from human blood
as long as the rest of us.

196
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,960
How do you do it?

197
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:12,062
Years and years of practice.

198
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:16,472
Did you ever think
of just doing it the easy way?

199
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,368
No.

200
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:23,982
I knew who I wanted to be.
I wanted to help people.

201
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:28,483
It brings me happiness,
even if I am damned regardless.

202
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,321
Damned?

203
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:36,022
Like hell?

204
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,902
Carlisle, you couldn't be damned.

205
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,568
You couldn't. It's impossible.

206
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,734
Thank you, Bella.

207
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:53,904
You've always been very gracious about us.

208
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:01,248
So that's it?
That's why he won't change me?

209
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,323
Imagine the situation in reverse.

210
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:11,228
If you believed as Edward does,

211
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,828
could you take away his soul?

212
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:39,888
You can't protect me

213
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,655
from everything.

214
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:47,098
At some point,
something's gonna separate us.

215
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,429
It's gonna be an accident or illness

216
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,003
or old age,

217
00:17:55,774 --> 00:18:00,143
as long as I'm human.
And the only solution is to change me.

218
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:05,378
That's not a solution. That's a tragedy.

219
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:09,080
You're not gonna want me
when I look like a grandmother.

220
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:22,600
Bella, do you not understand
my feelings for you at all?

221
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,100
Carlisle told me

222
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,336
how you feel about your soul.

223
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,743
I don't believe that.

224
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,042
So don't worry about mine.

225
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:42,016
You should go inside.

226
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,669
It's still my birthday.

227
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,298
So can I ask one thing?

228
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,108
Kiss me?

229
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:41,911
I love you.

230
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,915
I love you.

231
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,167
(Roslyn)

232
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:17,043
<i>Up with your turret</i>

233
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:23,277
<i>Aren't we just terrified?</i>

234
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:38,459
<i>Shale, screen your worry</i>

235
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:43,531
<i>From what you won't ever find</i>

236
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:56,354
<i>Don't let it fool you</i>

237
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:01,219
<i>Don't let it fool you</i>

238
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,919
<i>Down</i>

239
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,027
Hey.

240
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,372
Just come take a walk with me.

241
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:41,098
We have to leave Forks.

242
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:45,563
Why?

243
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:52,665
Carlisle's supposed to be
10 years older than he looks,

244
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:55,144
and people are starting to notice.

245
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:01,808
Okay, I've gotta think of something to say
to Charlie.

246
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,496
When you say "we"...

247
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:22,001
I mean my family and myself.

248
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:29,739
Edward, what happened with Jasper,
it's nothing.

249
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:32,778
You're right. It was nothing,

250
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,912
nothing but what I always expected

251
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:43,122
and nothing compared
to what could have happened.

252
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:51,965
You just don't belong in my world, Bella.

253
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,737
I belong with you.

254
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,811
No. You don't.

255
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:06,784
I'm coming.

256
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,013
Bella,

257
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:12,754
I don't want you to come.

258
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:22,061
You don't want me?

259
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:28,932
No.

260
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:36,047
That changes things a lot.

261
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,984
But if it's not too much to ask,

262
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:44,221
can you just promise me something?

263
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,786
Don't do anything reckless.

264
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:53,326
For Charlie's sake.

265
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,735
And I'll promise something to you in return.

266
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:00,670
This is the last time you'll ever see me.

267
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,865
I won't come back,

268
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:07,269
and you can go on with your life
without any interference from me.

269
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:11,846
It will be like I never existed, I promise.

270
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:19,053
If this is about my soul, take it.
I don't want it without you.

271
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,149
It's not about your soul.

272
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:26,594
You're just not good for me.

273
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,168
Not good enough for you.

274
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:34,031
I'm just sorry I let this go on for so long.

275
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:37,238
Please...

276
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:40,074
Don't...

277
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:46,714
Goodbye.

278
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:03,561
Edward.

279
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:17,542
Edward.

280
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:23,181
Edward.

281
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:27,488
Edward!

282
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:36,661
Edward.

283
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:34,979
I'm gonna try the Cullens' place again.

284
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:38,781
-The Cullens left town, Charlie.
-Good riddance.

285
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:40,552
Where'd they go?

286
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:43,459
We'll find her, Charlie.

287
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:45,860
-Thanks, Harry.
-Charlie!

288
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:47,223
Hey.

289
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,094
She's all right.

290
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:56,429
I got her. Thank you, Sam.

291
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,991
(Possibility)

292
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:42,546
<i>There's a possibility</i>

293
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:51,223
<i>There's a possibility</i>

294
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:57,694
<i>All that I had</i>

295
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:01,364
<i>Was all I'm gonna get</i>

296
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:09,711
Alice, you've disappeared,

297
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:14,285
like everything else.

298
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:18,249
Now who else can I talk to? I'm lost.

299
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,957
When you left,

300
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:30,528
and he left,

301
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,137
you took everything with you.

302
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:40,268
But the absence of him is everywhere I look.

303
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:51,179
It's like a huge hole has been punched
through my chest.

304
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:57,887
Bella.

305
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:16,046
But in a way I'm glad.

306
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:19,673
The pain is my only reminder
that he was real,

307
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:21,442
that you all were.

308
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:32,355
All right. That's it.

309
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:36,225
What?

310
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,967
You're going to Jacksonville
to live with your mother.

311
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:44,241
I'm not leaving Forks.

312
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:49,410
Bells, he's not coming back.

313
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,745
I know.

314
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:57,819
It's just not normal, this behavior.

315
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:02,323
Quite frankly, it's scaring the hell
out of me and your mother.

316
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:06,294
Baby, I don't want you to leave.

317
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:11,432
I don't, but just go. Go to Jacksonville.
Make some new friends.

318
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:13,163
I like my old friends.

319
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:16,002
-Well, you never see them anymore.
-I do.

320
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:23,738
I'm gonna go shopping tomorrow
with Jessica.

321
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,744
-You hate shopping.
-I...

322
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:31,614
I need a girls' night out.

323
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:37,257
All right. Girls' night.

324
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:39,994
Shopping.

325
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:44,495
I like it. Go buy some stuff.

326
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:54,868
<i>Hi, Jessica, it's Bella.</i>

327
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:57,979
Yeah, Bella Swan.

328
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:04,454
I don't know why
you want to sit through

329
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:07,821
all those zombies eating people
and no hot guys kissing anybody.

330
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:11,419
It's gross. Like... And why are there
that many zombie movies anyway?

331
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:14,090
'Cause if it's supposed to, like,
draw a parallel about leprosy,

332
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:17,157
my cousin had leprosy.
It's not funny, you know?

333
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:20,136
And, like, is it supposed to be
a metaphor for consumerism?

334
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:22,399
Because don't be so pleased
with your own, like,

335
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:25,101
self-referential cleverness, you know?

336
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:28,668
Like, some girls like to shop.
Not all girls, apparently.

337
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:31,738
Although I was surprised
you even called at all. You know?

338
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:34,944
Like, your depression thing,
I get it. I'm totally, totally worried.

339
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,043
But after a while it's like,

340
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,610
-you're still bumming...
-You want a ride, girls?

341
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,680
and I'm going through stuff, too.
You know? Like Mike deciding

342
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:40,815
he just wants to be friends.

343
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:41,881
What's up? Look what we found.

344
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,154
It's hard, you know?

345
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:44,558
Like, and since when does "just friends"...

346
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,153
-What's up guys?
-Look what we found.

347
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,289
Hey, where you going?

348
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:57,363
Keep walking.

349
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,138
This is dangerous.

350
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:13,251
-Dude, come on.
-Come here for a sec!

351
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,455
I think I know those guys.

352
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:22,357
We got beer! We got bikes!

353
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:25,525
Well, they seem great. Can we go?

354
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:28,769
I'm just gonna see something.

355
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:31,307
Hey, girlie!

356
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:38,409
All right, all right. We got a taker.

357
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:40,550
Turn around.

358
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,597
-Shut up!
-You shut up!

359
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:05,135
I'm sorry, I thought you
were somebody else.

360
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:08,042
No, that's cool.
I'll be whoever you want me to be, honey.

361
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:10,774
So, what do you say?

362
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:17,947
You promised me, nothing reckless.

363
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:25,090
You promised it would be
as if you never existed.

364
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:33,365
-You lied.
-You say something, babe?

365
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:34,928
You know what? Never mind.

366
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,718
Stop! Stop, stop, stop!

367
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:07,637
Hey, what the hell's wrong with you?

368
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:09,400
Just curious.

369
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:13,410
-I thought that I saw something.
-You...

370
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:17,511
You're insane, actually. Or suicidal.

371
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:20,609
That homeboy could've been a psycho.

372
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:25,054
I was about to end up in an FBI
interview room like some lame TV show.

373
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:27,415
God, that was such a rush.

374
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,687
Awesome.
So you're an adrenaline junkie now?

375
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:33,024
That's cool. You can go bungee jumping.

376
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:36,362
You don't get on the back
of some random loser's motorcycle.

377
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:37,594
Crazy.

378
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:44,768
Alice, I saw him.

379
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:49,677
Maybe I'm crazy now. I guess that's okay.

380
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:55,081
If a rush of danger
is what it takes to see him,

381
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,383
then that's what I'll find.

382
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,652
Bella!

383
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:05,821
Where the hell have you been, loca?

384
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:12,335
I brought you something.

385
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,598
-Okay.
-It's a little crazy.

386
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:24,341
Scrap metal. You shouldn't have.

387
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:26,645
I saved it from the junkyard.

388
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:32,754
I think they'll probably cost more to fix
than they're worth,

389
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,288
but then I thought that
if I had a mechanic friend

390
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,621
to help me out then...

391
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:40,061
-Me being the mechanic-type friend?
-That's right.

392
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:44,258
-Since when are you into motorcycles?
-Since now.

393
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,542
I get it if you think that
this is really stupid and reckless.

394
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:56,637
Yeah, I mean,
it's completely stupid and reckless.

395
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,277
When do we start?

396
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,686
Now.

397
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:09,322
-Please?
-All right.

398
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:16,096
Hey, be careful. Those things
are actually really heavy, so...

399
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:23,703
Jake, you're, like, buff.

400
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:26,038
How did that happen?
You're, like, 16. I don't get it.

401
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,443
Age is just a number, baby.
What are you, like, 40 now?

402
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:36,082
It feels like that sometimes.

403
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:48,993
That song's good. You don't like it?

404
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:54,503
I don't really like music anymore, kind of.

405
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:57,663
Okay. No more music.

406
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:02,938
So I was thinking,
if we're gonna do this every day,

407
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,879
and hopefully we will,

408
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,679
we have to, like,
fit some homework in there somewhere.

409
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:10,812
I don't want Billy thinking that
I'm a bad influence on you.

410
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:13,982
You? Influence me? Please.

411
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,885
Are you... I'm older than you,

412
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:22,330
so that makes me the influencer
and you the influencee.

413
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,992
No, no, no.

414
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:27,799
My size and knowledge base
actually makes me older than you

415
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:30,397
because of your general paleness
and lack of know-how.

416
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,965
I convinced you to build
2-wheeled death machines with me.

417
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:36,605
Don't you think that makes you
kind of young and naive?

418
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:38,911
Okay. So where do we stand?

419
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:42,886
-I'm 35. And you might be, like, 32.
-Come on.

420
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:47,650
-Yo, Jake, you in there?
-It's okay. It's just my boys.

421
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:50,523
-Hey, Jake.
-Hey. Guys, this is Bella.

422
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:53,119
-Bella, that's Quil and Embry.
-Hi.

423
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:55,561
I'm Quil Ateara.

424
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,602
So the bike building story is true.

425
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,763
Yeah, yeah,
I taught him everything he knows.

426
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,637
What about the part
where you're his girlfriend?

427
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,175
We're friends, you know.

428
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:09,906
-Burn.
-Actually,

429
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,881
remember I said she's a girl and a friend.

430
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,815
Embry, do you remember him
making that distinction?

431
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:15,874
Nope.

432
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:18,444
So you guys have girlfriends?
That's awesome.

433
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:23,217
Yeah, right.
Quil's actually taking his cousin to prom.

434
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,055
Yeah, that's still a riot.

435
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:28,098
You want funny, Black?
I'll give you funny.

436
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,731
Jeez.

437
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:32,132
Hey, that hold's illegal!

438
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,194
I got 5 bucks on Quil.

439
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:35,903
You're on.

440
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:37,863
(Shooting The Moon)

441
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:42,436
<i>All of the astronauts
Champagne in plastic cups</i>

442
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:46,813
<i>Waiting for the big hero to show</i>

443
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:51,944
<i>Outside the door he stands
His head in his hands</i>

444
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:55,251
<i>And his heart in his throat</i>

445
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:58,352
<i>What can he tell them now</i>

446
00:39:58,696 --> 00:39:59,958
Dear Alice,

447
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,396
I wish I had your real address.

448
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:05,393
I wish I could tell you about Jake.

449
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:07,864
He makes me feel better.

450
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:11,473
I mean, he makes me feel alive.

451
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:16,171
The hole in my chest,

452
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:21,274
well, when I'm with Jake,
it's like it's almost healed

453
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,751
for a while.

454
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:28,321
So, Quil keeps asking to come over.
I think he likes you a little too much.

455
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:34,494
Well, I'm really not into
the whole cougar thing. You know?

456
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,691
What's up with you and age?

457
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:42,138
I mean,
how old was that Cullen guy, anyway?

458
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:47,609
But even Jake can't keep
the dreams away.

459
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,981
Hey, hey, hey!

460
00:40:58,689 --> 00:40:59,883
Wake up, Bella.

461
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,619
You're okay. You're okay.

462
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:18,141
I thought this thing was starting to work,
but I guess not.

463
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:26,574
Can I ask you something?

464
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:30,486
Hanging out with Jacob,

465
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:35,119
that seems to take your mind
off things a bit, doesn't it?

466
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,927
You know, sometimes

467
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:46,962
you gotta learn to love what's good for you.

468
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:49,703
You know what I mean?

469
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:54,268
Of course, what do I know?

470
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:56,909
I'm just a terminal bachelor.

471
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:01,207
Famous ladies' man.

472
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:04,879
Okay.

473
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,382
I'm gonna go to bed.

474
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:10,082
Uh...

475
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:12,027
I love you.

476
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:22,696
If I told you I couldn't have fixed
these bikes, what would you have said?

477
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:27,543
Are you doubting your mad skills?

478
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:31,579
No. Definitely not.
I mean, they'll run fine.

479
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:33,949
It's just,

480
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:39,687
maybe if I was smart,
I would have dragged out the rebuild a bit.

481
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:48,822
If you told me you couldn't fix these bikes,
I would say that that's really too bad,

482
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:52,767
but that we're just gonna
have to find something else to do.

483
00:42:57,942 --> 00:42:59,671
Is that Sam Uley?

484
00:43:00,644 --> 00:43:03,044
Yeah. Him and his cult.

485
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:07,383
My God.

486
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:12,149
Did you see that?

487
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:21,762
They're not really fighting, Bella.
They're cliff diving.

488
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:24,323
Scary as hell, but a total rush.

489
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:30,471
-A rush?
-Most of us jump from lower down.

490
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:33,840
We leave the showing off
to Sam and his disciples.

491
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,345
You have some kind of beef with him
or something?

492
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:42,041
I don't know.

493
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,679
They just think they run this place.

494
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:48,023
Embry used to call them
hall monitors on steroids.

495
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:50,526
-Now look at him.
-That's Embry?

496
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:54,694
-Yeah.
-What happened to him?

497
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:56,757
He missed some school.

498
00:43:56,834 --> 00:44:00,930
Now all of a sudden, he started
following Sam around like a little puppy.

499
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:03,838
Same thing happened with Paul and Jared.

500
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,606
Sam keeps giving me this look,

501
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:11,409
like he's waiting for me or something.

502
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:15,413
It's kind of starting to freak me out.

503
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,886
Well, you should just avoid him.

504
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:21,254
I try.

505
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:39,706
Okay.

506
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:44,906
-You look scared.
-I'm not.

507
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:47,680
All right.

508
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:49,742
-Brake?
-That one.

509
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:54,488
Clutch?

510
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:55,752
Good.

511
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:57,218
Gas?

512
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:00,992
Ready?

513
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:05,193
Now, slowly release the clutch.

514
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,398
Bella.

515
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:12,964
Stop.

516
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:19,874
You all right?

517
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:22,948
I'm gonna go again.

518
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,547
Okay.

519
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:44,831
Hit the brake!

520
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,447
I wanna go again.

521
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:02,253
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

522
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:04,886
-No. I want to go again.
-No. Forget it.

523
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:07,323
No more bikes.

524
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:09,823
Man, your head.

525
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:15,133
-Yeah.
-My God, I'm sorry.

526
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:19,036
What, you're apologizing for bleeding?

527
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:22,975
Yeah. I guess I am.

528
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:26,748
Well, it's just blood, Bella. No big deal.

529
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:33,284
There.

530
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:41,922
What are you staring at?

531
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,429
You're sort of beautiful.

532
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,644
How hard did you hit your head?

533
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:00,140
I don't know.

534
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:03,918
Let's go.

535
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:08,824
I did see something in the woods.

536
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:10,758
Totally. Baby, I believe you.

537
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,126
No, he doesn't.
He's just trying to get lucky.

538
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:18,558
No, okay.
It was jet black and huge.

539
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:21,468
On all 4s,
it was still taller than a person.

540
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:22,732
A bear, maybe?

541
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:25,274
Or an alien.
You're lucky you didn't get probed.

542
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,668
Well, I saw it.

543
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:31,438
You know, you're not the only one.

544
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:34,911
My dad's been getting reports
at the station.

545
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:37,920
Like, 5 hikers have been killed
by some bear.

546
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:40,115
But they can't find the bear.

547
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:46,160
Last time you clowns doubt my girlfriend.

548
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:51,734
So? I mean,

549
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:54,196
Bella's back?

550
00:47:58,008 --> 00:47:59,600
Yeah, I guess so.

551
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:02,236
All right, that's... Well, welcome.

552
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:06,341
So, listen, now that you're talking

553
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:12,515
and eating again, which, you know,
you've got to get that protein in there,

554
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:18,857
I was just wondering if you wanted to go
see a movie with me.

555
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,528
Yeah. Sure. Yeah, I do.

556
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,666
Cool.

557
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,230
Let me see, we could check out

558
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:34,072
Love Spelled Backwards Is Love.

559
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:37,272
You know, it's a dumb title,
but it's a romantic comedy.

560
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:40,180
-I mean, it's supposed to be pretty...
-No. No romance.

561
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:47,314
How about Face Punch?
Have you heard of that?

562
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:50,591
I mean, that's an action movie.

563
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:52,492
Yeah, that's perfect.

564
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:55,160
Guns, adrenaline.

565
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:57,261
That's my thing.

566
00:48:57,334 --> 00:48:58,494
Okay.

567
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:03,203
We should get a bunch of people to go.
Do you guys want to go see Face Punch?

568
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,501
Face Punch, yeah!

569
00:49:04,574 --> 00:49:06,064
Mike, hey,
we were supposed to watch that.

570
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:07,701
Remember, the trailer's like...

571
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,008
-"Punch faces."
-I remember.

572
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,776
Yeah! Movie night with Bella.

573
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:17,884
So Face Punch?

574
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:20,547
You like action movies?

575
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,948
Not really.

576
00:49:25,929 --> 00:49:28,693
I heard it sucks. Bad.

577
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,101
Are you even old enough to see this movie?

578
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:35,800
I mean, you know, without,
like, adult supervision.

579
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:37,840
Right, yeah, well,
she's buying my ticket for me.

580
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:39,842
She's buying it. Okay.

581
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:43,913
Jessica bailed,
and Angela got the stomach flu,

582
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,245
so Eric's taking care of her.

583
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,377
-It's just us 3.
-Great!

584
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:52,011
-Great.
-Yeah.

585
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:56,523
<i>Put your gun down.</i>

586
00:49:56,593 --> 00:49:59,289
<i>Put your gun down or I'm gonna
blow your frickin' head off.</i>

587
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:01,831
<i>Both of you put both
of your guns down</i>

588
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:04,628
<i>or I'm gonna blow both
of your frickin' heads off.</i>

589
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:07,503
<i>All right, forget it, let's do this!</i>

590
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:28,447
Okay, I think I'm gonna throw up.

591
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:35,961
He's...

592
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:38,130
What a marshmallow!

593
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:42,727
You should hold out for someone
with a stronger stomach.

594
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:46,264
Someone who laughs at the gore
that makes weaker men vomit.

595
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:48,174
Yeah. I'll keep my eye open for that.

596
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:54,816
I feel bad. He probably has
that flu that's going around.

597
00:50:58,155 --> 00:51:00,487
What? I can't hold your hand?

598
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,582
No, of course you can.

599
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:09,456
I just think it means, you know,
something a little different to you. So...

600
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:15,069
Okay, well, tell me something.
You like me, right?

601
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,572
And you think I'm sort of beautiful?

602
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:27,276
Jacob, please, don't do this.

603
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:35,149
Why?

604
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:41,393
Because you're about to ruin everything.

605
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:45,861
And I need you.

606
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:55,244
Well, I've got loads of time.

607
00:51:56,379 --> 00:51:58,279
I'm not gonna give up.

608
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:02,010
I don't want you to,

609
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:07,484
but it's just 'cause I don't want you
to go anywhere.

610
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:12,290
And that's really selfish.

611
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:19,030
You know,
I'm not like a car that you can fix up.

612
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:27,200
I'm never gonna run right.
So I should be fair to you.

613
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:31,876
It's because of him, right?

614
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:43,420
Look,

615
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:47,495
I know what he did to you.

616
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:53,097
But, Bella, I would never ever do that.

617
00:52:55,805 --> 00:52:59,002
I won't ever hurt you. I promise.

618
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,410
I won't let you down.

619
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,280
You can count on me.

620
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:14,112
Well,

621
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,258
I need to go home.

622
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:31,272
I was feeling sick before the movie. Okay?

623
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:35,842
What is your problem?

624
00:53:35,912 --> 00:53:38,176
Right now? You're my problem.

625
00:53:38,848 --> 00:53:42,181
Feeling sick?
Maybe you need to go to the hospital.

626
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,151
You want me to put you in the hospital?

627
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:48,555
Jake! Jake. Jake, the movie's over.
What are you doing?

628
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:51,587
You're really hot.

629
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:56,428
Like, you feel like you have a fever.
Are you okay?

630
00:53:57,434 --> 00:53:59,732
I don't know what's happening.

631
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:03,195
I gotta go.

632
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:09,973
That dude is weird.

633
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:16,212
<i>Jake, your dad says you have mono.</i>

634
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:19,949
He won't let me visit,
but would you call me?

635
00:54:25,495 --> 00:54:28,123
Hey, it's me again. I just...

636
00:54:29,165 --> 00:54:32,100
I'm sorry about what I said
at the movie theater.

637
00:54:33,169 --> 00:54:36,400
I just wanted to hear your voice,
so no pressure.

638
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:40,942
Jacob, please...

639
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:44,278
Call me.

640
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:46,975
Okay. We should be back around 3:00.

641
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:55,184
Hey.

642
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,117
Look, I don't have to go fishing today.

643
00:54:58,194 --> 00:54:59,627
Yes, you do.

644
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:02,624
Yeah, you do.
Go. What are you talking about?

645
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:04,394
Just be careful.

646
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:05,900
Always am.

647
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:10,095
Those bears won't get the drop on me,
Bella.

648
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:12,164
My kung fu is strong.

649
00:55:45,408 --> 00:55:46,568
Jake!

650
00:55:47,577 --> 00:55:48,839
Hey!

651
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:55,617
You cut your hair off?

652
00:55:58,455 --> 00:56:00,286
And got a tattoo?

653
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:04,854
Bella.

654
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:07,897
I thought you were too sick to come outside

655
00:56:08,832 --> 00:56:11,528
or pick up the phone when I call.

656
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:14,100
Go away.

657
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:16,598
What?

658
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:19,605
Go away.

659
00:56:21,578 --> 00:56:23,773
What happened to you? What's...

660
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:26,111
Hey! What happened?

661
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:32,145
Did Sam get to you?
Is that what's happening?

662
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:35,521
Sam's trying to help me. Don't blame him.

663
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:39,094
But if you want somebody to blame,

664
00:56:39,262 --> 00:56:43,198
how about those filthy bloodsuckers
you love, the Cullens?

665
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:51,533
I don't know what you're talking about.

666
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:54,338
No, you know exactly
what I'm talking about.

667
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:57,175
You've been lying to everyone. Charlie.

668
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:01,507
But you can't lie to me.

669
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:04,780
-Not anymore, Bella.
-Jacob!

670
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:06,786
Jacob!

671
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:14,319
Look, Bella,

672
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:17,897
we can't be friends anymore.

673
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:22,534
Look, Jake,
I know that I've been hurting you.

674
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:27,233
It's killing me. It kills me.

675
00:57:29,512 --> 00:57:32,310
I just need... Maybe give me, like,

676
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:34,407
-some time or something.
-Look, don't.

677
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:36,875
It's not you.

678
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:42,690
It's not you, it's me, right? Really?

679
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:45,958
It's true. It is me.

680
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:51,025
I'm not good.

681
00:57:53,837 --> 00:57:57,034
I used to be a good kid.

682
00:57:58,374 --> 00:57:59,773
Not anymore.

683
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:03,538
This doesn't even matter. All right?

684
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:04,836
This is over.

685
00:58:04,914 --> 00:58:07,075
You can't break up with me.

686
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:10,280
I mean...

687
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:13,918
I mean, you're my best friend.

688
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:18,189
You promised me.

689
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:20,993
I know.

690
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:24,561
I promised I wouldn't hurt you, Bella.

691
00:58:25,401 --> 00:58:27,961
And this is me keeping that promise.

692
00:58:28,738 --> 00:58:30,069
Go home

693
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:34,243
and don't come back
or you're gonna get hurt.

694
00:58:47,757 --> 00:58:49,088
Alice,

695
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:51,616
things are...

696
00:58:53,263 --> 00:58:55,163
Things are bad again.

697
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:59,460
Without Jake, I just... I can't stand it.

698
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:05,103
I don't see Edward anymore.

699
00:59:06,576 --> 00:59:09,477
Will it really feel like he never existed?

700
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:20,149
I will find the place
where I can see him again.

701
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:16,639
Bella.

702
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:18,942
Laurent.

703
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:23,441
I didn't expect to find you here.

704
01:00:25,588 --> 01:00:29,888
I went to visit the Cullens,
but the house is empty.

705
01:00:32,228 --> 01:00:34,753
I'm surprised they left you behind.

706
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,955
Weren't you sort of

707
01:00:38,101 --> 01:00:39,693
a pet of theirs?

708
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:42,228
Yeah. You could say that.

709
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:44,637
Do the Cullens visit often?

710
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:50,835
Lie.

711
01:00:56,452 --> 01:00:57,714
Yeah, absolutely, all the time.

712
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,378
Lie better.

713
01:00:59,455 --> 01:01:02,049
I'll tell them that you stopped by.

714
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,854
But I probably shouldn't

715
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:07,990
tell Edward,

716
01:01:09,799 --> 01:01:11,164
'cause he's pretty protective.

717
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:13,429
But he's far away, isn't he?

718
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:18,102
Why are you here?

719
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:22,543
I came as a favor to Victoria.

720
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,539
-Victoria?
-She asked me to see

721
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:31,246
if you were still under
the protection of the Cullens.

722
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:34,721
Victoria feels it's only fair
to kill Edward's mate,

723
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:36,953
given he killed hers.

724
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:38,789
An eye for an eye.

725
01:01:39,462 --> 01:01:40,656
Threaten him.

726
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:44,222
Edward would know who did it.
And he'd come after you.

727
01:01:45,268 --> 01:01:47,202
I don't think he will.

728
01:01:48,404 --> 01:01:51,373
After all, how much could you mean to him

729
01:01:51,808 --> 01:01:54,299
if he left you here unprotected?

730
01:01:56,679 --> 01:01:59,671
Victoria won't be happy
about my killing you,

731
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:01,740
but I can't help myself.

732
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:03,814
You are so mouth-watering.

733
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:07,617
-Please, don't. I mean, you helped us.
-No, no...

734
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:12,056
Don't be afraid. I'm doing you a kindness.

735
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:15,023
Victoria plans on killing you slowly,

736
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:17,630
painfully,

737
01:02:18,601 --> 01:02:20,831
whereas I'll make it quick.

738
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:22,569
I promise.

739
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,564
You will feel nothing.

740
01:02:31,314 --> 01:02:32,941
Edward, I love you.

741
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:37,013
I don't believe it.

742
01:03:44,053 --> 01:03:46,613
-Dad! I saw them.
-What's the matter?

743
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:49,715
-In the woods. They're not bears.
-What do you mean "in the woods"?

744
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:51,521
Bell, what the hell
were you doing out in the woods?

745
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:55,325
They're wolves.
I mean, they're like huge wolves.

746
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:57,263
Are you sure about that, Bella?

747
01:03:57,333 --> 01:04:00,564
Yeah! I just saw them.
They were after something.

748
01:04:01,737 --> 01:04:02,965
Wolves?

749
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:05,607
You saw them?

750
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:10,804
All right, well, Harry,

751
01:04:12,081 --> 01:04:15,414
feel like going hunting?
Get some of your guys together?

752
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:17,910
Sure, yeah, I'll just...

753
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,520
By now, those wolves will be dead,

754
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:26,185
and Laurent would have told her
I'm unprotected.

755
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:27,524
Victoria.

756
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:30,755
I should go to the station.

757
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:33,267
Yeah, you should. You should go.

758
01:04:33,903 --> 01:04:36,269
Can you just stay in the house?

759
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:02,559
Bella!

760
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:06,667
You scared me.

761
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:10,194
-What the hell are you doing?
-Back up. I'm coming up.

762
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:23,645
Hey.

763
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:27,516
Look, I'm sorry.

764
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:36,895
-For what?
-I wish I could explain.

765
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:40,129
But I literally can't.

766
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:52,245
Have you ever had a secret
you couldn't tell anyone,

767
01:05:53,182 --> 01:05:55,650
one that wasn't yours to share?

768
01:05:58,554 --> 01:06:01,079
Well, that's what it's like for me.

769
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:02,688
But worse.

770
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:07,461
You have no idea how tight I'm bound.

771
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:10,064
I hate this.

772
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,991
I hate what they've done to you.

773
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:30,543
I mean, the killer part is,
you already know.

774
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:39,356
Bella, do you remember
when we walked on the beach at La Push?

775
01:06:40,896 --> 01:06:42,193
The...

776
01:06:46,202 --> 01:06:48,864
The story. The story about

777
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:51,799
the cold ones.

778
01:06:53,542 --> 01:06:57,273
I guess I understand
why that's the only part you remember.

779
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:08,154
There's gotta be something that you can do.

780
01:07:08,224 --> 01:07:10,249
No. I'm in it for life.

781
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:14,322
Well, maybe we should just
get out of here for a while.

782
01:07:14,397 --> 01:07:16,262
Just leave,

783
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:17,959
just you and me.

784
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:19,993
You'd do that?

785
01:07:23,139 --> 01:07:25,107
I would do it for you.

786
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:34,747
It's not something
I can just run away from, Bella.

787
01:07:35,684 --> 01:07:39,176
But I would run away with you

788
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:44,858
if I could.

789
01:07:48,998 --> 01:07:52,229
I gotta go.
They'll start wondering where I am.

790
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:57,872
Come here.

791
01:08:02,144 --> 01:08:03,441
Please,

792
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,277
try to remember.

793
01:08:07,883 --> 01:08:10,010
It'd be so much easier

794
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:12,845
if you knew.

795
01:08:15,324 --> 01:08:17,815
I'll try. But, Jake...

796
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:21,357
Jake, what are you doing? Wait, Jake.

797
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:29,664
Jake.

798
01:08:46,555 --> 01:08:48,318
Edward, I'm scared.

799
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:50,518
You should be.

800
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:57,532
Really, it's just like an old story.

801
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,465
I'm not really supposed
to say anything about it.

802
01:08:59,535 --> 01:09:03,335
Did you know Quileutes
are supposedly descended from wolves?

803
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:19,415
Bella?

804
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:21,584
I need to see him.

805
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:23,848
He's not in.

806
01:09:25,528 --> 01:09:28,827
-Okay, I'm sorry, I really need to see him.
-Bella!

807
01:09:44,813 --> 01:09:46,474
What did you do?

808
01:09:47,483 --> 01:09:48,507
-Okay, what did you do?
-Hey.

809
01:09:48,584 --> 01:09:49,983
-What did you do to him?
-Easy!

810
01:09:50,052 --> 01:09:51,110
He didn't want this.

811
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:53,553
What did we do? What did he do?
What'd he tell you?

812
01:09:53,622 --> 01:09:55,055
-Both of you calm down.
-Nothing.

813
01:09:55,124 --> 01:09:58,218
He tells me nothing
because he's scared of you.

814
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:05,299
-Too late now.
-Bella, get back!

815
01:10:06,468 --> 01:10:09,198
Paul, calm down, now!

816
01:10:17,846 --> 01:10:19,074
Bella!

817
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:21,442
Run!

818
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:26,018
Jake, run!

819
01:10:52,214 --> 01:10:53,374
Paul!

820
01:11:04,026 --> 01:11:06,688
Hey! Take Bella back to Emily's place.

821
01:11:08,397 --> 01:11:10,797
Guess the wolf's out of the bag.

822
01:11:15,804 --> 01:11:19,672
Alice, is it possible that
everything is true?

823
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:22,776
The fairy tales and horror stories?

824
01:11:22,845 --> 01:11:26,406
Is it possible that there isn't anything
sane or normal at all?

825
01:11:28,584 --> 01:11:30,484
Hey, I think we should go back
and see if Jacob's okay.

826
01:11:30,552 --> 01:11:33,214
I hope Paul sinks some teeth in him.
Serves him right.

827
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:35,086
No way. Jacob's a natural.

828
01:11:35,157 --> 01:11:38,888
You see him phase on the fly?
I got 5 says Paul doesn't touch him.

829
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:41,395
Come on in, Bella. We won't bite.

830
01:11:41,764 --> 01:11:43,527
Speak for yourself.

831
01:11:43,599 --> 01:11:44,623
(Done All Wrong)

832
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,691

833
01:11:46,769 --> 01:11:48,964
<i>And done all wrong</i>

834
01:11:50,172 --> 01:11:53,164
<i>All the wrong I've done
I'm sure I'll live quite long</i>

835
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:57,838
Hey, about Emily, Sam's fiance?
Don't stare. It bugs Sam.

836
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:02,177
Why would I stare?

837
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:05,379
Are you guys hungry? Like I have to ask.

838
01:12:12,795 --> 01:12:14,387
Who's this?

839
01:12:14,463 --> 01:12:16,294
Bella Swan. Who else?

840
01:12:19,068 --> 01:12:21,332
So, you're the vampire girl.

841
01:12:24,373 --> 01:12:26,432
So, you're the wolf girl.

842
01:12:29,311 --> 01:12:30,744
Guess so.

843
01:12:30,813 --> 01:12:33,373
Well, I'm engaged to one.

844
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:41,247
Save some for your brothers.
And ladies first. Muffin?

845
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:43,781
Sure. Thanks.

846
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:47,351
Leave it to Jacob to find a way
around Sam's gag order.

847
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:50,098
He didn't say anything to me.

848
01:12:50,165 --> 01:12:51,325
That's a wolf thing.

849
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,891
Alpha's orders get obeyed
whether we want them to or not.

850
01:12:53,969 --> 01:12:56,233
And check it out.
We can hear each other's thoughts.

851
01:12:56,305 --> 01:13:00,173
Would you shut up?
These are trade secrets. Damn it!

852
01:13:00,476 --> 01:13:02,808
This chick runs with vampires.

853
01:13:03,812 --> 01:13:06,406
You can't really run with vampires.

854
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:10,249
'Cause they're fast.

855
01:13:10,486 --> 01:13:13,250
Yeah? Well, we're faster.

856
01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:16,317
Freaked out yet?

857
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,460
You're not the first monsters I've met.

858
01:13:20,529 --> 01:13:23,362
Jake's right.
You're good with weird.

859
01:13:25,134 --> 01:13:26,294
Hey.

860
01:13:45,687 --> 01:13:47,052
Sorry.

861
01:14:01,503 --> 01:14:03,368
So you're a werewolf?

862
01:14:05,174 --> 01:14:07,574
Yeah. Last time I checked.

863
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:12,906
A few lucky members
of the tribe have the gene.

864
01:14:13,215 --> 01:14:17,083
A bloodsucker moves into town
and the fever sets in.

865
01:14:19,655 --> 01:14:20,747
Mono.

866
01:14:22,491 --> 01:14:24,015
Yeah. I wish.

867
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:31,357
Well, can't you find a way to just stop?

868
01:14:33,902 --> 01:14:35,893
I mean, it's wrong.

869
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:41,032
It's not a lifestyle choice, Bella.

870
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:44,173
I was born this way. I can't help it.

871
01:14:44,246 --> 01:14:47,443
You're such a hypocrite. What,
I'm not the right kind of monster for you?

872
01:14:47,516 --> 01:14:49,416
It's not what you are.

873
01:14:49,852 --> 01:14:53,219
It's what you do. They never hurt anybody.

874
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:57,090
You've killed people, Jake.

875
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:59,559
Bella, we're not killing anyone.

876
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:03,029
Then who is?

877
01:15:03,098 --> 01:15:06,067
What we're trying
to protect you people from,

878
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:08,462
the only thing we do kill,

879
01:15:10,839 --> 01:15:12,136
vampires.

880
01:15:13,642 --> 01:15:14,700
Wait, Jake, you can't.

881
01:15:14,776 --> 01:15:17,040
Don't worry.
We can't touch your little precious Cullens

882
01:15:17,112 --> 01:15:19,580
unless they violate the treaty.

883
01:15:20,148 --> 01:15:22,309
That's not what I'm saying.

884
01:15:22,584 --> 01:15:25,144
You can't kill vampires. They'll...

885
01:15:25,621 --> 01:15:27,282
They'll kill you.

886
01:15:27,456 --> 01:15:30,892
Really? We took out that leech
with the dreads easy enough.

887
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:36,456
Laurent?

888
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:39,194
And his red-headed girlfriend is next.

889
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:41,034
Victoria's here?

890
01:15:41,103 --> 01:15:44,129
Was. We chased her all the way
to the Canadian border the other night.

891
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:47,642
She keeps coming back.
We don't know what she's after.

892
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:49,040
I do.

893
01:15:52,414 --> 01:15:53,540
Me.

894
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:05,491
Don't worry. We've got this place covered.

895
01:16:06,161 --> 01:16:08,629
She won't get near you or Charlie.

896
01:16:09,197 --> 01:16:10,926
Look, you've got to be careful.

897
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:14,127
She's fast. You don't know how fast she is.

898
01:16:14,202 --> 01:16:18,070
You know, your lack of confidence in us
is a little insulting.

899
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:21,440
All right, I'd better go.

900
01:16:22,811 --> 01:16:24,369
You gotta go?

901
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,440
Yeah.

902
01:16:27,182 --> 01:16:29,309
Got a vampire to kill.

903
01:16:42,965 --> 01:16:45,490
Alice, I'm all right.

904
01:16:47,169 --> 01:16:48,932
Until I'm alone.

905
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:52,672
And lately, that's all the time.

906
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:55,804
Jacob's gone. He's hunting Victoria.

907
01:16:55,877 --> 01:16:58,141
And Charlie's hunting Jacob.

908
01:16:58,213 --> 01:16:59,908
And you're gone.

909
01:17:00,882 --> 01:17:02,645
And so is Edward.

910
01:17:06,655 --> 01:17:09,021
And there's just nothing now.

911
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:14,085
You got something, Harry?

912
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:16,924
Nope. Nothing.

913
01:17:24,606 --> 01:17:26,540
But I realize where I have to go,

914
01:17:26,608 --> 01:17:29,133
what I have to do to see him again.

You're like your own sun.

974
01:24:09,911 --> 01:24:13,608
This is better, now that you know about me.

975
01:24:16,951 --> 01:24:18,179
But...

976
01:24:23,458 --> 01:24:25,824
You saw what happened to Emily.

977
01:24:29,164 --> 01:24:30,756
Sam got angry.

978
01:24:31,699 --> 01:24:33,894
Lost it for a split second.

979
01:24:35,303 --> 01:24:37,396
Em was standing too close.

980
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:42,538
He'll never be able to take that back.

981
01:24:45,146 --> 01:24:47,171
What if I got mad at you?

982
01:24:58,626 --> 01:25:00,093
Sometimes,

983
01:25:02,664 --> 01:25:05,224
I feel like I'm gonna disappear.

984
01:25:11,806 --> 01:25:14,070
Okay, not that you need me

985
01:25:14,709 --> 01:25:17,041
to tell you something like this,

986
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:22,275
but I always will.
You're not gonna lose yourself.

987
01:25:25,186 --> 01:25:27,347
I wouldn't let that happen.

988
01:25:29,624 --> 01:25:30,852
How?

989
01:25:34,329 --> 01:25:36,627
I'll tell you all the time

990
01:25:40,268 --> 01:25:42,259
how special you are.

991
01:26:01,723 --> 01:26:03,953
Thank you. For everything.

992
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:12,159
Wait.

993
01:26:14,969 --> 01:26:16,664
There's a vampire.

994
01:26:17,105 --> 01:26:18,834
How do you know?

995
01:26:19,073 --> 01:26:22,099
I can smell it. I'm getting you out of here.

996
01:26:22,944 --> 01:26:24,502
That's Carlisle's car.

997
01:26:26,047 --> 01:26:27,537
They're here.

998
01:26:27,916 --> 01:26:31,443
Bella, it's a trick! Stop!
You gotta come with me!

999
01:26:35,023 --> 01:26:36,650
They won't hurt me.

1000
01:26:36,724 --> 01:26:40,125
If a Cullen is back here,
this is their territory.

1001
01:26:40,562 --> 01:26:42,962
Treaty says we can only defend
on our own lands.

1002
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:47,092
-I can't protect you here.
-Okay. That's okay. You don't have to.

1003
01:26:49,604 --> 01:26:51,367
You're about to cross a line.

1004
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:53,373
Then don't draw one.

1005
01:26:53,675 --> 01:26:54,937
Please?

1006
01:27:11,859 --> 01:27:13,053
Alice?

1007
01:27:13,361 --> 01:27:15,921
-My God! What are you...
-Bella!

1008
01:27:16,564 --> 01:27:20,762
I'm sorry, I just,
I can't believe you're here. Is...

1009
01:27:20,835 --> 01:27:24,134
Would you like to explain to me
how you're alive?

1010
01:27:24,872 --> 01:27:25,896
What?

1011
01:27:25,974 --> 01:27:29,171
I saw a vision of you.
You jumped off a cliff.

1012
01:27:30,111 --> 01:27:32,238
Why in the hell
would you try and kill yourself?

1013
01:27:32,313 --> 01:27:33,473
I mean, what about Charlie?

1014
01:27:33,548 --> 01:27:36,312
-What about...
-I didn't try to kill myself.

1015
01:27:36,384 --> 01:27:37,851
I was cliff jumping.

1016
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:39,682
Recreationally.

1017
01:27:39,754 --> 01:27:41,153
It was fun.

1018
01:27:43,658 --> 01:27:47,389
I have never met anyone more
prone to life-threatening idiocy.

1019
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:53,992
Does...

1020
01:27:54,569 --> 01:27:56,628
Did you tell him?

1021
01:27:56,704 --> 01:27:57,762
No.

1022
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:02,170
He only calls in once every few months.

1023
01:28:03,778 --> 01:28:06,042
He said he wants to be alone.

1024
01:28:11,886 --> 01:28:15,253
Bella, what is that
God-awful wet dog smell?

1025
01:28:18,526 --> 01:28:20,289
That's probably me.

1026
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:23,560
Or it's Jacob.

1027
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:26,198
Jacob who?

1028
01:28:27,535 --> 01:28:29,662
Jacob's kind of a werewolf.

1029
01:28:31,272 --> 01:28:34,400
Bella!
Werewolves are not good company to keep.

1030
01:28:35,677 --> 01:28:37,542
Speak for yourself.

1031
01:28:42,417 --> 01:28:44,578
I had to see you were safe.

1032
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:48,884
I thought you couldn't protect me here.

1033
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:50,920
Guess I don't care.

1034
01:28:54,629 --> 01:28:56,893
Well, I'm not gonna hurt her.

1035
01:28:58,499 --> 01:29:00,433
No, you're just a harmless Cullen.

1036
01:29:00,501 --> 01:29:03,937
I'm talking about the other bloodsucker
who tried to kill Bella because of you.

1037
01:29:04,005 --> 01:29:05,063
Victoria?

1038
01:29:05,139 --> 01:29:07,266
Yeah, Victoria's been around.

1039
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:09,105
I didn't see her.

1040
01:29:09,610 --> 01:29:13,137
I didn't see you
get pulled out of the water, either.

1041
01:29:14,048 --> 01:29:17,017
I can't see past you and your pack of mutts.

1042
01:29:17,085 --> 01:29:19,246
Don't get me upset...

1043
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:23,484
-Hey, stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop.
-...or things are gonna get very ugly.

1044
01:29:28,863 --> 01:29:30,797
I'll give you a minute.

1045
01:29:36,804 --> 01:29:37,862
Hey.

1046
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:41,568
You're not going anywhere.
You're gonna come back,

1047
01:29:41,642 --> 01:29:44,406
-right?
-As soon as you put the dog out.

1048
01:29:53,421 --> 01:29:54,786
Is he...

1049
01:29:58,926 --> 01:30:00,484
Are there others?
How many Cullens are here

1050
01:30:00,561 --> 01:30:02,756
and how long are they staying?

1051
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:03,922
No.

1052
01:30:04,832 --> 01:30:06,561
It's just Alice.

1053
01:30:11,205 --> 01:30:14,003
And she can stay as long as she'd like.

1054
01:30:16,444 --> 01:30:18,776
Well, are the rest coming back?

1055
01:30:25,086 --> 01:30:26,144
No.

1056
01:30:28,022 --> 01:30:29,455
Not that I know of.

1057
01:30:30,625 --> 01:30:32,183
Anything else?

1058
01:30:36,464 --> 01:30:37,829
That's it.

1059
01:30:40,034 --> 01:30:43,697
Well, if that's all,
then you'd better go run back to Sam.

1060
01:30:46,774 --> 01:30:48,571
I've done it again.

1061
01:30:49,544 --> 01:30:51,705
I keep breaking my promise.

1062
01:30:56,951 --> 01:30:59,715
We don't have to do this to each other.

1063
01:31:04,158 --> 01:31:05,716
Yes, we do.

1064
01:31:17,572 --> 01:31:18,903
Bella...

1065
01:31:41,796 --> 01:31:43,388
Swan residence.

1066
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:51,263
He's not here right now.

1067
01:31:51,973 --> 01:31:53,873
He's arranging a funeral.

1068
01:32:09,824 --> 01:32:11,451
Who was that?

1069
01:32:11,726 --> 01:32:12,784
What?

1070
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:14,657
Always in the way.

1071
01:32:16,831 --> 01:32:18,025
Who was that?

1072
01:32:18,099 --> 01:32:19,760
Bella, step back.

1073
01:32:19,834 --> 01:32:23,031
-Jake, who was that?
-Bella! Bella, it's Edward.

1074
01:32:23,638 --> 01:32:27,039
He thinks you're dead.
Rosalie told him why I came here.

1075
01:32:29,243 --> 01:32:31,973
Why would you...
Why didn't you let me speak to him?

1076
01:32:32,046 --> 01:32:33,240
-He didn't ask for you.
-Bella.

1077
01:32:33,314 --> 01:32:36,875
-I don't care!
-Bella. Bella! He's going to the Volturi.

1078
01:32:37,552 --> 01:32:39,452
He wants to die, too.

1079
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:44,517
He left you, Bella.
He didn't want you anymore. Remember?

1080
01:32:44,592 --> 01:32:48,050
No, I'm not gonna let him kill himself
out of guilt.

1081
01:32:48,763 --> 01:32:50,594
What about your dad?

1082
01:32:51,165 --> 01:32:54,532
I'm 18. I'm legally free to go,
and I left a note.

1083
01:32:56,304 --> 01:32:58,033
Please, Bella,

1084
01:32:59,473 --> 01:33:01,566
just stay here.

1085
01:33:03,344 --> 01:33:04,834
For Charlie.

1086
01:33:07,648 --> 01:33:09,206
Or for me.

1087
01:33:10,251 --> 01:33:11,775
I have to go.

1088
01:33:17,758 --> 01:33:19,487
I'm begging you.

1089
01:33:22,163 --> 01:33:23,562
Please.

1090
01:33:25,299 --> 01:33:26,926
Goodbye, Jacob.

1091
01:33:35,443 --> 01:33:36,637
Okay.

1092
01:34:38,105 --> 01:34:40,437
So you've made up your minds.

1093
01:34:40,675 --> 01:34:43,143
I'm afraid your particular gifts

1094
01:34:44,278 --> 01:34:46,610
are too valuable to destroy.

1095
01:34:47,548 --> 01:34:52,417
But if you're unhappy
with your lot, join us.

1096
01:34:53,554 --> 01:34:57,285
We would be delighted to utilize
your skills.

1097
01:34:58,225 --> 01:35:00,785
Won't you consider staying with us?

1098
01:35:02,563 --> 01:35:04,929
You know it will happen anyway.

1099
01:35:04,999 --> 01:35:06,899
Not without cause.

1100
01:35:11,172 --> 01:35:12,730
Such a waste.

1101
01:35:19,947 --> 01:35:21,778
I'm guessing you didn't rent this car?

1102
01:35:21,849 --> 01:35:23,908
I figured you wouldn't be opposed
to grand theft auto.

1103
01:35:23,984 --> 01:35:25,349
Not today.

1104
01:35:28,689 --> 01:35:30,350
What? What do you see?

1105
01:35:30,424 --> 01:35:32,324
They refused him.

1106
01:35:32,393 --> 01:35:34,827
-So?
-He's gonna make a scene.

1107
01:35:35,162 --> 01:35:37,960
-Show himself to the humans.
-No! When?

1108
01:35:39,033 --> 01:35:42,059
He's gonna wait until noon,
when the sun's at its highest.

1109
01:35:44,839 --> 01:35:46,033
God, Alice, you got to hurry up.

1110
01:35:46,107 --> 01:35:48,007
There's Volterra.

1111
01:36:12,767 --> 01:36:15,600
-Why are they all in red?
-San Marco's Day festival.

1112
01:36:15,669 --> 01:36:18,502
They're commemorating
the expulsion of vampires from the city.

1113
01:36:18,572 --> 01:36:19,903
It's the perfect setting.

1114
01:36:19,974 --> 01:36:22,534
The Volturi will never let him
get far enough to reveal himself.

1115
01:36:22,610 --> 01:36:24,339
We have 5 minutes.

1116
01:36:24,411 --> 01:36:26,675
I know, Bella, just breathe.

1117
01:36:32,787 --> 01:36:33,776
Alice!

1118
01:36:33,854 --> 01:36:36,049
Bella, you're the only one
he can't see coming.

1119
01:36:36,123 --> 01:36:39,183
If I go, he'll read my thoughts.
He'll think I'm lying. He'll rush into it.

1120
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:43,293
-Where do I go?
-He'll be under the clock tower. Go!

1121
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:37,074
Don't!

1122
01:38:39,146 --> 01:38:40,306
Heaven.

1123
01:38:40,381 --> 01:38:42,042
You have to move.

1124
01:38:42,883 --> 01:38:45,647
Open your eyes. Look at me. I'm alive.

1125
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:48,149
You have to move.

1126
01:38:49,023 --> 01:38:50,251
Bella.

1127
01:38:57,731 --> 01:38:59,824
-You're here.
-I'm here.

1128
01:39:02,703 --> 01:39:03,897
You're alive.

1129
01:39:07,374 --> 01:39:08,568
Yes.

1130
01:39:18,018 --> 01:39:20,612
I needed to make you see me once.

1131
01:39:21,655 --> 01:39:22,952
You had to know that I was alive,

1132
01:39:23,023 --> 01:39:26,151
that you didn't have
to feel guilty about anything.

1133
01:39:29,029 --> 01:39:31,623
I can let you go now.

1134
01:39:36,403 --> 01:39:38,564
I never acted out of guilt.

1135
01:39:41,008 --> 01:39:44,500
I just couldn't live in a world
where you don't exist.

1136
01:39:45,913 --> 01:39:47,938
-But you said...
-I lied.

1137
01:39:48,649 --> 01:39:51,743
I had to lie. But you believed me so easily.

1138
01:39:57,391 --> 01:40:00,986
Because it doesn't make sense
for you to love me.

1139
01:40:03,697 --> 01:40:07,292
I mean, I'm nothing. I'm human. I'm nothing.

1140
01:40:08,502 --> 01:40:12,063
Bella, you're everything to me.

1141
01:40:14,041 --> 01:40:15,736
You're everything.

1142
01:40:41,468 --> 01:40:43,561
I won't be needing your services after all,
gentlemen.

1143
01:40:43,637 --> 01:40:45,730
Aro wants to speak with you again.

1144
01:40:45,806 --> 01:40:47,034
No rules were broken.

1145
01:40:47,107 --> 01:40:51,305
Nonetheless, we should take this
conversation to a more appropriate venue.

1146
01:40:51,378 --> 01:40:52,640
Fine.

1147
01:40:53,947 --> 01:40:56,313
Bella, why don't you go
and enjoy the rest of the festival?

1148
01:40:56,383 --> 01:40:57,748
The girl comes with us.

1149
01:40:57,818 --> 01:40:59,513
No. You can go to hell.

1150
01:41:01,889 --> 01:41:03,481
Come on, guys.

1151
01:41:03,724 --> 01:41:07,125
It's a festival.
You wouldn't want to make a scene.

1152
01:41:07,961 --> 01:41:09,394
We wouldn't.

1153
01:41:09,763 --> 01:41:11,094
Enough.

1154
01:41:12,666 --> 01:41:13,792
Jane.

1155
01:41:14,601 --> 01:41:17,593
Aro sent me to see what was taking so long.

1156
01:41:25,646 --> 01:41:27,614
Just do as she says.

1157
01:41:40,194 --> 01:41:41,559
Go ahead.

1158
01:41:45,566 --> 01:41:47,227
Don't be scared.

1159
01:41:48,168 --> 01:41:49,499
Are you?

1160
01:41:50,471 --> 01:41:51,563
No.

1161
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:32,271
-Is she human?
-Yes.

1162
01:42:35,449 --> 01:42:37,076
Does she know?

1163
01:42:37,551 --> 01:42:38,711
Yes.

1164
01:42:39,086 --> 01:42:40,849
Then, why would...

1165
01:42:42,489 --> 01:42:44,286
She wants to be.

1166
01:42:44,758 --> 01:42:46,157
And so she will be.

1167
01:42:46,226 --> 01:42:47,659
Or dessert.

1168
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:59,970
Sister. They send you out
to get 1 and you bring back 2.

1169
01:43:00,707 --> 01:43:02,174
And a half.

1170
01:43:03,343 --> 01:43:04,742
Such a clever girl.

1171
01:43:04,811 --> 01:43:06,711
What a happy surprise!

1172
01:43:07,781 --> 01:43:10,409
Bella is alive after all.

1173
01:43:11,318 --> 01:43:13,980
Isn't that wonderful?

1174
01:43:15,088 --> 01:43:16,988
I love a happy ending.

1175
01:43:21,428 --> 01:43:23,259
They are so rare.

1176
01:43:30,103 --> 01:43:32,628
Her blood appeals to you so much

1177
01:43:33,907 --> 01:43:35,738
it makes me thirsty.

1178
01:43:36,009 --> 01:43:38,773
How can you stand to be so close to her?

1179
01:43:38,979 --> 01:43:41,971
-It's not without difficulty.
-Yes, I can see that.

1180
01:43:45,385 --> 01:43:48,946
Aro can read every thought
I've ever had with one touch.

1181
01:43:49,990 --> 01:43:52,185
And now you know everything.

1182
01:43:52,826 --> 01:43:54,589
So get on with it.

1183
01:43:57,731 --> 01:44:00,928
You are quite a soul reader yourself,
Edward.

1184
01:44:02,569 --> 01:44:06,835
Though you can't read Bella's thoughts.

1185
01:44:10,244 --> 01:44:11,711
Fascinating.

1186
01:44:15,249 --> 01:44:20,619
I would love to see if you are
an exception to my gifts, as well.

1187
01:44:23,357 --> 01:44:25,484
Would you do me the honor?

1188
01:44:46,346 --> 01:44:47,779
Interesting.

1189
01:44:49,950 --> 01:44:51,542
I see nothing.

1190
01:45:00,894 --> 01:45:02,418
I wonder if...

1191
01:45:03,263 --> 01:45:06,232
Let us see if she's immune
to all our powers.

1192
01:45:07,801 --> 01:45:09,268
Shall we, Jane?

1193
01:45:11,138 --> 01:45:12,867
-No!
-Pain.

1194
01:45:28,922 --> 01:45:30,253
Stop!

1195
01:45:31,091 --> 01:45:32,820
Stop! Please! Stop!

1196
01:45:32,893 --> 01:45:36,761
Stop! Just stop hurting him!
Please! Please!

1197
01:45:38,465 --> 01:45:39,693
Jane?

1198
01:45:41,802 --> 01:45:42,791
Master?

1199
01:45:47,374 --> 01:45:49,103
Go ahead, my dear.

1200
01:45:54,614 --> 01:45:56,809
This may hurt just a little.

1201
01:46:12,966 --> 01:46:14,433
Remarkable!

1202
01:46:16,670 --> 01:46:18,900
She confounds us all.

1203
01:46:19,940 --> 01:46:23,137
So what do we do with you now?

1204
01:46:23,677 --> 01:46:26,771
You already know
what you're going to do, Aro.

1205
01:46:27,781 --> 01:46:29,646
She knows too much.

1206
01:46:30,183 --> 01:46:31,946
She's a liability.

1207
01:46:35,922 --> 01:46:37,480
That's true.

1208
01:46:41,361 --> 01:46:42,623
Felix?

1209
01:46:46,533 --> 01:46:47,591
No!

1210
01:47:49,162 --> 01:47:52,256
Please! No! No! please!

1211
01:47:55,135 --> 01:47:58,263
Kill me! Kill me! Not him.

1212
01:48:09,282 --> 01:48:11,807
How extraordinary.

1213
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:17,957
You would give up your life
for someone like us.

1214
01:48:19,059 --> 01:48:20,424
A vampire.

1215
01:48:21,828 --> 01:48:24,262
A soulless monster.

1216
01:48:24,331 --> 01:48:26,322
Just get away from her!

1217
01:48:30,437 --> 01:48:34,874
You don't know a thing about his soul.

1218
01:48:46,486 --> 01:48:48,181
This is a sadness.

1219
01:48:50,323 --> 01:48:53,884
If only it were your intention
to give her immortality.

1220
01:49:02,802 --> 01:49:04,064
Wait!

1221
01:49:05,705 --> 01:49:07,798
Bella will be one of us.

1222
01:49:09,509 --> 01:49:10,999
I've seen it.

1223
01:49:12,779 --> 01:49:14,713
I'll change her myself.

1224
01:49:48,615 --> 01:49:50,105
Mesmerizing.

1225
01:49:50,550 --> 01:49:54,953
To see what you have seen
before it has happened.

1226
01:49:57,891 --> 01:50:02,351
Your gifts will make for an intriguing

1227
01:50:03,597 --> 01:50:05,030
immortal,

1228
01:50:06,099 --> 01:50:07,623
Isabella.

1229
01:50:12,505 --> 01:50:13,938
Go now.

1230
01:50:14,641 --> 01:50:16,609
Make your preparations.

1231
01:50:17,410 --> 01:50:19,401
Let us be done with this.

1232
01:50:21,247 --> 01:50:23,511
Heidi will arrive any moment.

1233
01:50:25,385 --> 01:50:28,786
Thank you for your visit.

1234
01:50:28,855 --> 01:50:30,413
We will return the favor.

1235
01:50:30,490 --> 01:50:33,459
I would advise that you follow through
on your promise soon.

1236
01:50:33,526 --> 01:50:35,892
We do not offer second chances.

1237
01:50:37,530 --> 01:50:40,624
Goodbye, my young friends.

1238
01:50:47,007 --> 01:50:48,838
Nice fishing, Heidi.

1239
01:50:48,908 --> 01:50:51,138
Yes, they do look rather juicy.

1240
01:50:51,211 --> 01:50:52,940
Save some for me.

1241
01:50:53,913 --> 01:50:56,711
This way, please. Stay together.

1242
01:51:11,364 --> 01:51:12,888
Stop! Stop!

1243
01:51:23,777 --> 01:51:25,301
You're here.

1244
01:51:27,347 --> 01:51:28,939
You can sleep.

1245
01:51:32,719 --> 01:51:35,347
I'll still be here when you wake up.

1246
01:51:38,958 --> 01:51:41,984
Bella, the only reason I left

1247
01:51:43,763 --> 01:51:46,698
was because I thought
I was protecting you.

1248
01:51:48,568 --> 01:51:50,229
I needed you

1249
01:51:50,303 --> 01:51:54,239
to have a chance at a normal, happy life.

1250
01:51:58,344 --> 01:52:00,710
It was so easy for you to leave.

1251
01:52:03,316 --> 01:52:06,979
Leaving you was the hardest thing
I've done in 100 years.

1252
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:15,318
And I swear,

1253
01:52:16,663 --> 01:52:19,291
I will never fail you again.

1254
01:52:21,601 --> 01:52:23,159
I'm so sorry.

1255
01:52:25,572 --> 01:52:27,506
-Charlie's coming.
-Hey.

1256
01:52:30,643 --> 01:52:32,042
You okay?

1257
01:52:33,446 --> 01:52:34,708
I'm fine.

1258
01:52:37,817 --> 01:52:39,978
Dad, you don't have to worry.

1259
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:42,511
You know, last time you said that,
you took off.

1260
01:52:42,589 --> 01:52:44,750
I didn't see you for 3 days.

1261
01:52:46,459 --> 01:52:48,359
I'm really sorry, Dad.

1262
01:52:50,130 --> 01:52:53,827
Bella, do not ever do that to me again.

1263
01:52:56,669 --> 01:52:57,761
Ever.

1264
01:53:00,573 --> 01:53:02,131
And you're grounded

1265
01:53:02,609 --> 01:53:04,736
for the rest of your life.

1266
01:53:05,912 --> 01:53:07,072
Okay.

1267
01:53:17,357 --> 01:53:20,155
I'm not technically
breaking any of his rules.

1268
01:53:23,163 --> 01:53:26,394
He did say
I couldn't take a step inside the door.

1269
01:53:26,866 --> 01:53:29,164
I came in through the window.

1270
01:53:32,806 --> 01:53:35,297
He's not gonna forgive me easily.

1271
01:53:37,777 --> 01:53:39,074
I know.

1272
01:53:41,114 --> 01:53:42,479
Can you?

1273
01:53:46,252 --> 01:53:47,810
I hope you can,

1274
01:53:48,621 --> 01:53:51,818
'cause I honestly don't know
how to live without you.

1275
01:53:56,162 --> 01:53:57,561
Come here.

1276
01:54:15,215 --> 01:54:18,184
Once Alice changes me,

1277
01:54:21,120 --> 01:54:23,247
you can't get rid of me.

1278
01:54:24,490 --> 01:54:26,788
She won't need to change you.

1279
01:54:27,393 --> 01:54:30,885
There are always ways
to keep the Volturi in the dark.

1280
01:54:32,599 --> 01:54:34,999
No. No.

1281
01:54:41,774 --> 01:54:43,765
You all know what I want.

1282
01:54:45,979 --> 01:54:48,948
And I know how much I'm asking for.

1283
01:54:51,217 --> 01:54:54,709
The only thing that I can think of
for it to be fair is to just vote.

1284
01:54:54,787 --> 01:54:58,154
-You don't know what you're talking about.
-Shut up.

1285
01:54:59,759 --> 01:55:00,953
Alice?

1286
01:55:01,427 --> 01:55:03,987
I already consider you my sister.

1287
01:55:07,767 --> 01:55:09,394
-Yes.
-Thank you.

1288
01:55:09,469 --> 01:55:10,959
I vote "yes."

1289
01:55:12,405 --> 01:55:15,897
It would be nice to not
want to kill you all the time.

1290
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:20,243
I'm sorry.

1291
01:55:22,148 --> 01:55:25,276
I'm really sorry to both of you
for how I've acted,

1292
01:55:25,919 --> 01:55:27,978
and I'm really grateful
that you were brave enough

1293
01:55:28,054 --> 01:55:30,147
to go and save my brother.

1294
01:55:31,691 --> 01:55:35,127
But this isn't a life
I would have chosen for myself.

1295
01:55:37,664 --> 01:55:41,327
And I wish that there'd been someone
to vote "no" for me.

1296
01:55:44,237 --> 01:55:45,636
So, no.

1297
01:55:47,073 --> 01:55:48,973
I vote "Hell, yeah."

1298
01:55:50,910 --> 01:55:53,276
And we can pick a fight
with these Volturi some other way.

1299
01:55:53,346 --> 01:55:56,315
I already consider you a part of the family.

1300
01:55:56,950 --> 01:55:58,178
Yes.

1301
01:56:04,057 --> 01:56:06,287
Why are you doing this to me?

1302
01:56:07,994 --> 01:56:09,359
You know what this means.

1303
01:56:09,429 --> 01:56:13,297
You've chosen not to live without her,
which leaves me no choice.

1304
01:56:14,033 --> 01:56:15,933
I won't lose my son.

1305
01:56:22,141 --> 01:56:26,168
I'll wait until after graduation
to make it easier on Charlie.

1306
01:56:31,184 --> 01:56:34,119
Edward, I want you to be the one to do it.

1307
01:56:41,094 --> 01:56:43,187
He wants to talk to me.

1308
01:56:46,332 --> 01:56:47,959
So you're still alive for now.

1309
01:56:48,034 --> 01:56:50,502
He thinks it's me keeping you away.

1310
01:56:50,570 --> 01:56:53,061
You stay the hell out of my head.

1311
01:56:54,173 --> 01:56:57,665
Jacob, I know you have something
to say to me.

1312
01:57:00,013 --> 01:57:03,915
But I want to say something to you first,
if that's all right.

1313
01:57:05,051 --> 01:57:06,450
Thank you.

1314
01:57:09,589 --> 01:57:12,990
Thank you for keeping Bella alive
when I didn't.

1315
01:57:13,526 --> 01:57:15,619
No. You didn't.

1316
01:57:17,630 --> 01:57:20,292
And it wasn't for your benefit, trust me.

1317
01:57:20,366 --> 01:57:22,231
I'm still grateful.

1318
01:57:22,802 --> 01:57:24,030
But I'm here now.

1319
01:57:24,103 --> 01:57:26,833
I'm not gonna leave her side
until she orders me away.

1320
01:57:26,906 --> 01:57:28,237
We'll see.

1321
01:57:31,110 --> 01:57:33,271
Hey, my turn to talk.

1322
01:57:37,850 --> 01:57:41,377
I'm here to remind you
about a key point in the treaty.

1323
01:57:41,554 --> 01:57:43,419
I haven't forgotten.

1324
01:57:43,489 --> 01:57:45,047
What key point?

1325
01:57:45,291 --> 01:57:47,589
If any of them bites a human,

1326
01:57:48,361 --> 01:57:50,124
the truce is over.

1327
01:57:51,531 --> 01:57:53,362
But if I choose it,
it has nothing to do with you.

1328
01:57:53,433 --> 01:57:55,458
No. No, I won't let you.

1329
01:57:57,070 --> 01:57:59,504
You're not gonna be one of them, Bella.

1330
01:57:59,572 --> 01:58:01,472
It's not up to you.

1331
01:58:02,175 --> 01:58:04,541
You know what we'll do to you.
I won't have a choice.

1332
01:58:04,610 --> 01:58:06,305
Bella, please, come.

1333
01:58:06,379 --> 01:58:07,539
Wait.

1334
01:58:09,515 --> 01:58:12,109
Is he gonna hurt me? Read his mind.

1335
01:58:19,459 --> 01:58:20,790
Jake,

1336
01:58:27,233 --> 01:58:28,825
I love you.

1337
01:58:33,539 --> 01:58:35,200
So, please,

1338
01:58:39,779 --> 01:58:41,838
don't make me choose,

1339
01:58:47,620 --> 01:58:49,554
'cause it'll be him.

1340
01:58:52,925 --> 01:58:54,790
It's always been him.

1341
01:59:02,268 --> 01:59:03,599
Bella...

1342
01:59:11,377 --> 01:59:14,505
-Goodbye, Jacob.
-No, you don't speak for her!

1343
01:59:19,285 --> 01:59:21,276
Bella, get out of here.

1344
01:59:23,055 --> 01:59:24,420
Stop!

1345
01:59:26,626 --> 01:59:27,923
Stop!

1346
01:59:27,994 --> 01:59:31,054
You can't hurt each other
without hurting me.

1347
01:59:50,082 --> 01:59:51,208
Jake.

1348
02:00:06,265 --> 02:00:07,698
He's right.

1349
02:00:08,834 --> 02:00:11,268
You shouldn't become what I am.

1350
02:00:16,475 --> 02:00:18,136
I can't do this alone.

1351
02:00:20,813 --> 02:00:22,781
Then, please, just wait.

1352
02:00:29,789 --> 02:00:32,417
Just give me 5 years.

1353
02:00:38,030 --> 02:00:39,657
That's too long.

1354
02:00:44,136 --> 02:00:45,603
Then 3?

1355
02:00:50,309 --> 02:00:52,106
You're so stubborn.

1356
02:00:53,980 --> 02:00:56,073
What are you waiting for?

1357
02:01:04,824 --> 02:01:07,884
I have one condition

1358
02:01:10,363 --> 02:01:12,831
if you want me to do it myself.

1359
02:01:16,969 --> 02:01:18,800
What's the condition?

1360
02:01:19,405 --> 02:01:21,100
And then forever.

1361
02:01:22,875 --> 02:01:24,775
That's what I'm asking.

1362

Subtitles: Arigon

1363
