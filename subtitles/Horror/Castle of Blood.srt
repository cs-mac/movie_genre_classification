1
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,858
There came a light tap
at the library door -

2
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,756
and, pale as the tenant of a tomb,

3
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,322
a menial entered upon tiptoe.

4
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,049
His looks were wild with terror,

5
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,818
and he spoke to me in a voice
tremulous,

6
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,692
husky, and very low.

7
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,808
What said he?

8
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,772
- Some broken sentences I heard.

9
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,976
He told of a wild cry disturbing
the silence of the night -

10
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,959
of the gathering together of the household -

11
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,222
of a search in the direction of the sound;

12
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,996
and then his tones grew thrillingly distinct

13
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,282
as he whispered me of a violated grave -

14
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,377
of a disfigured body
enshrouded,

15
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,633
yet still breathing - still palpitating -
still alive.

16
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,439
He pointed to garments;

17
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,096
they were muddy and clotted with gore.

18
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,448
I spoke not,

19
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,736
and he took me gently by the hand:

20
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,372
it was indented with the impress
of human nails.

21
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,823
He directed my attention
to some object against the wall.

22
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,984
I looked at it for some minutes:
it was a spade.

23
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,576
With a shriek I bounded to the table,
and grasped the box that lay upon it.

24
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,895
But I could not force it open;

25
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,416
and in my tremor, it slipped from my hands,
and fell heavily, and burst into pieces;

26
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,696
and from it, with a rattling sound,

27
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,872
there rolled out some instruments
of dental surgery,

28
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,758
intermingled with thirty-two

29
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,359
small, white and

30
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,865
ivory-looking substances

31
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,916
that were scattered to and fro
about the floor.

32
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,082
They were the thirty-two magnificent
teeth of my cousin Berenice,

33
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,409
The teeth that had obsessed me
during her illness,

34
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,617
and which,
six months after her death,

35
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,678
I had found again

36
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,992
during a horrible night

37
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,047
when I no longer remembered
what I had done

38
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,944
and what had befallen me.

39
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,207
I know that story. It's by you.

40
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,767
It almost seems real
when you tell it.

41
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,800
- Who are you?
- Alan Foster, journalist for The Times.

42
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,449
You're the one who's been after me
for the last five days.

43
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,145
You refused to see me. It was the
only way to get an interview.

44
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,722
It's not every day that
Edgar Allan Poe shows up in London.

45
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,639
Yes, it's the first time
I've been in England

46
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,535
and certainly the last.

47
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,217
London has disappointed you so much?

48
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,465
Life has disappointed me.

49
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,859
Please sit down.

50
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,702
I admit that I'm not a fiction writer.

51
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,049
I'm one of your colleagues.
I'm a chronicler.

52
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,039
My tales
are drawn from real facts.

53
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,097
Real in your writer's
teeming imagination.

54
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,737
No. It's simply a matter of
true cases, my young friend.

55
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,912
I'm not a child. There's only
seven years difference between us.

56
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,239
Seven?

57
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,890
No. Between us, there are centuries
and a word that doesn't exist:

58
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,041
Death.

59
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,895
You are extraordinary.

60
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,216
If death is really
the only sure thing, then...

61
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,473
You confuse the grave
with death, my young friend.

62
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,122
The marble slab of a sepulchre
proves the existence of the grave,

63
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,168
but not of what lies
beyond the grave,

64
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,791
a world inhabited by an incalculable
number of anonymous beings.

65
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,814
Don't ridicule me.

66
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,272
An intelligent man like you
couldn't believe in the beyond

67
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,668
except for poetic purposes.

68
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,841
I thank you for treating me
like a fool in such an elegant way.

69
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,559
That was not at all my intention.

70
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,242
I admire and respect you too much
to talk to you in such a manner.

71
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,553
But I'm convinced
that the cycle of life

72
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,018
finishes with death, in the grave.

73
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,959
Beyond, there is the void, nothingness.

74
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,038
Therefore, nothing material,
nothing concrete.

75
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,312
The spirit is impalpable
without the body

76
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,215
which is the essence of living beings.

77
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,036
The dead cannot return to earth,
as they do in your stories,

78
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,657
much less frighten us.

79
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,432
As for me, I'm very afraid,

80
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,779
but only of the living.

81
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,878
Who stop doing harm
only after their death.

82
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,048
Permit me, sir?

83
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,239
I am Lord Thomas Blackwood.

84
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,119
I wager £100
that you will not be able

85
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,278
to spend the night in my castle
in Providence.

86
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,257
You think that I would run away,
blinded by fear?

87
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,079
No, you won't run away.

88
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,762
All those who accepted my wager
died in the castle.

89
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,258
I'm sorry, but I can't
accept your wager.

90
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,078
You're right, my young friend.

91
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,288
I heard of this castle

92
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,592
located on Providence hill,
when I arrived in London.

93
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,305
The last ones to enter it were
a young couple on their honeymoon.

94
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,334
The husband was a cousin of my wife.

95
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,337
Lord Thomas will correct me if I'm wrong,
but it's my understanding

96
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,116
that they never left it again.
- They stayed there because they liked it.

97
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,369
I doubt they vanished into thin air.

98
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,969
Dead or alive,
they left the castle.

99
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,855
Forgive me for contradicting you,

100
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,585
but Mr. Poe is right.
They never left the castle.

101
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,082
They are resting there,
in the family cemetery.

102
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,386
Every year, I search for a brave man
to take up my challenge,

103
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,792
in the hope of clearing up the mystery
of this terrifying legend.

104
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,598
You are very nice,

105
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,936
and I'm happy
that you have refused my wager.

106
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,762
It's not that I don't want to,
but I can't, my lord.

107
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,219
A £100,

108
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,945
that's too great a sum
for the pocket of an honest journalist.

109
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,408
- But £10...
- You'll accept for £10?

110
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,411
- Whenever you like.
- It must be tonight...

111
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,023
the night of the dead.

112
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,066
Today is the first of November.
From midnight to dawn,

113
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,416
the dead return to the castle
to relive the tragedies of their deaths.

114
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,198
Very well! Tonight,
my theory will be confirmed,

115
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,358
and I'll write a sensational article

116
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,063
about the castles of terror.

117
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,904
Think well, my young friend.

118
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,658
Everything's been thought of.
I'll finish the interview, and we'll go.

119
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,054
We must leave now.

120
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,922
The castle is far. It will take
at least two hours by coach.

121
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,948
Yes, but I have
to write my article.

122
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,586
If that's the only thing that keeps you,
we can talk on the way,

123
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,638
for I don't mind accompanying you.

124
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,479
It's a great honour, Mr. Poe.

125
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,975
In that case,

126
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,907
let's go. Would you mind if we stop
for a moment at my newspaper?

127
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,638
Od course.

128
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,935
Have you ever tried writing

129
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,323
stories based on reality?

130
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,568
Reality...

131
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,256
always voyages beyond,
outside, or beneath

132
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,988
all the forms established

133
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,818
by society or by the mind,

134
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:08,040
to the abysses, to the
bottom of the sea, to the South Pole.

135
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,428
Of all melancholy topics, what,

136
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,576
according to the
universal understanding of mankind,

137
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,399
is the most melancholy?

138
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,344
Death is the obvious reply.

139
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,608
And when is this most melancholy of topics

140
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,465
most poetical? When it most closely
allies itself to Beauty.

141
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,995
The death then of a beautiful woman
is unquestionably

142
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,038
the most poetical topic in the world.

143
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,648
We've arrived.

144
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,105
You can still withdraw
and return with us.

145
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,663
Your £10 is too tempting.

146
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,713
- Think carefully.
- Thanks for the interview,

147
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,458
and I hope Lord Thomas's ghosts
will let me publish it.

148
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,063
We'll come back at dawn.
Good luck.

149
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,838
Good luck, my young friend.

150
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,482
You'll find torches
under the staircase.

151
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,369
Don't let yourself be influenced
by this atmosphere.

152
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,858
All this is absurd.

153
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,857
These suspicious noises,
these strange apparitions

154
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,463
must have a rational explanation!

155
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,377
To doubt, even if only for a second,
means to be afraid.

156
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,299
It's an optical illusion.

157
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,446
It's very simple.
It's just an optical illusion.

158
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,925
Did my brother send you?

159
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,762
If your brother is
Lord Thomas Blackwood, then yes.

160
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,442
Your brother told me
that the castle was unoccupied.

161
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,769
Yes, I know what he says.

162
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,463
- To him, I'm dead.

163
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,937
He refuses to see me
ever since I left

164
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,953
his world
to seek happiness here.

165
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:51,016
Haven't you been able to persuade him
to reconcile with you?

166
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,158
No, I've stayed alone.

167
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,952
Maybe it's better
that I go away.

168
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,983
Are you afraid of me?

169
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,522
No, but if had known,
I wouldn't have accepted this wager.

170
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,295
Of course...

171
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,818
The famous wager that my brother
offers each year

172
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,918
in order to give me company
for one night

173
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:20,160
and to nourish the legend
that surrounds this castle.

174
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,618
Are these stories true?

175
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,205
They are fantastic stories.

176
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,648
They're coincidences,
chance occurrences.

177
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,183
Don't you want to win the wager?

178
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:36,256
Has anyone won it
before me?

179
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,704
The past matters little.

180
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,862
Now, there is just you, me,
and £100.

181
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,543
To tell the truth,
I bet only £10.

182
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,024
I'm not as rich
as you think.

183
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,764
You won't become rich,

184
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,402
but you can help me
put one over on m'lord.

185
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,758
Come.

186
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,652
I've prepared your room
on this floor.

187
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,055
You knew I was coming?

188
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,703
Of course.
You, or someone else...

189
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,128
Every year,
someone comes on this night.

190
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,228
On this night...

191
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,368
the night of the dead.

192
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,895
- Are you afraid?
- Who blew them out?

193
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,849
No one.

194
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,426
Everything goes out and lights up again
sometimes, surely you know that.

195
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,154
You're trembling.

196
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,607
It's cold here.

197
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,963
Must it be up to me,

198
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,128
a woman, to put you at ease?

199
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,409
- I thought you were braver than that...
- Look.

200
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,299
- What?
- The painting.

201
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,032
Once again the candlelight

202
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,073
has played tricks with me.

203
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,358
Tricks?

204
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,648
A simple optical illusion.

205
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,905
The portrait of your ancestor

206
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,738
looked to me
like a living image.

207
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,283
Julia doesn't belong
to the Blackwood family.

208
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,688
And what's more, she's my age.

209
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,762
Forgive me, I keep saying
stupid things.

210
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,798
Please offer my excuses
to Lady Julia,

211
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,878
though I don't have the honour
of knowing her.

212
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,992
I'm sure you'll know her soon.

213
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,008
I found it on the ground
in the stable.

214
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:49,336
- I brought it up, thinking that...

215
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,239
I've been looking for it for a long time.

216
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,899
I had lost it.

217
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,132
Strange! I was expecting
to spend a terrifying night

218
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,198
and I find myself
in such charming company.

219
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,856
If you're referring to me,
you won't be disappointed.

220
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,922
I don't disappoint
people I like...

221
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,498
And I like you.

222
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,162
But Julia is very mistrustful,
especially toward men.

223
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,182
Here we are.
Here things are a little more in order.

224
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,336
I have no servants anymore,
and I've neglected the ground floor.

225
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,058
But these rooms are still pleasant.

226
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,359
Come close to me, Alan.

227
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,942
Tell me about the world outside,
and tell me about yourself.

228
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,929
There's nothing new in London.

229
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,368
Fog, boredom,
and eternal traditions.

230
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,744
You see, London hasn't changed.

231
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,679
You haven't missed anything
by staying in this castle.

232
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,171
It's we Londoners who have been deprived
of the pleasure of admiring your charm

233
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,459
and your beauty.

234
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,745
You are very nice,
and you have the an

235
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,463
of making yourself agreeable
in a woman's eyes.

236
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,558
I say what I think.
It's not a compliment.

237
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,212
It's been a long time
since I felt myself so much a woman.

238
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,417
You wanted me
to speak of myself, too.

239
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,172
I am poor, a bachelor,
and without family.

240
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,079
I'm thirty years old, I'm a journalist,

241
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,449
and I feel terribly alone.

242
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,379
I'm desperately alone, too.

243
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,689
May I join you?

244
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,458
Happy to make your acquaintance.

245
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,378
Elisabeth has told you about me?

246
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,224
She only satisfied my curiosity,

247
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:39,196
because your portrait interested me.
But you are even more beautiful.

248
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,055
You flatter me.

249
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,804
What did she tell you?

250
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,839
Your name. Only your name.

251
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,233
Should I be grateful,
and thank you for your discretion?

252
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,642
No. It would have been better
if you hadn't come.

253
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,305
Why? Perhaps I'm bothering you?

254
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:01,515
Not at all. We were talking about London
and about me, before going to bed.

255
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,829
Together, of course.

256
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,014
What are you saying?

257
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:09,547
Excuse me, I didn't mean to
refer to what Elisabeth was imagining.

258
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,768
I meant at the same time,

259
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,662
- and not in the same bed.
- Stop it!

260
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,772
I, too, wish you a good night

261
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,894
even if it's without her.

262
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,815
I don't understand you.

263
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,658
Don't lie, Alan.
You don't know how to lie.

264
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,278
Who told you my first name?

265
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:47,731
No one. I heard Elisabeth
say it when I came in.

266
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,419
I'm telling you
for the last time:

267
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:14,212
stop insulting me, humiliating me,
persecuting me.

268
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,448
You don't know
what I'm capable of.

269
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,843
I know you.
What can you do to me?

270
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,407
Kill me, perhaps?
You can't.

271
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,353
- And so?
- Be quiet!

272
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,188
It's not enough for you
that you've ruined my life?

273
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,948
Why do you persecute me like this?

274
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,959
You like Alan, don't you?

275
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,857
- Admit you like him.
- Yes! I like him.

276
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,679
- And I desire him.
- You don't love him...

277
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,479
Yes, yes, I love him.

278
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:49,035
You poor thing, if hadn't been there,
you'd be happy in his arms.

279
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,438
Happy...

280
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,297
Maybe with him
I would have been happy.

281
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,832
No, it's not true.
You've never been happy.

282
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,282
But, this time,
I had a kind of premonition.

283
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,233
Julia, I beg you,
I entreat you,

284
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,273
leave me one last chance.

285
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,132
No, you will only be happy
beside me.

286
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,698
Get out! I am a woman,
do you understand?

287
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,343
A real woman.
Get out of my life.

288
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,824
What life, Elisabeth ?

289
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,065
Do you know
what you're saying?

290
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:30,785
I despise you, I hate you, Julia.

291
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,018
<i>"I'll wait for you at midnight
in the park under the big oak tree. Herbert"</i>

292
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,472
Excuse me, I wanted to see
if you were sleeping.

293
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,513
I was going to go back to bed
without waking you.

294
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,418
I was going to read
a very interesting book.

295
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,079
I never sleep before dawn

296
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,153
because I spend all my nights
at the newspaper.

297
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,578
- May I stay a little while?
- Of course.

298
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,793
One would have to be stupid
or abnormal to refuse

299
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,208
the company of
a beautiful woman like you.

300
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,039
This isn't the best thing before sleeping.
But if you were going to read, I'll go.

301
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,073
No, please stay.

302
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,472
There are so many things
to read in your eyes.

303
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:44,866
The things that are written
in my eyes:

304
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,645
Kiss me.

305
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,152
Hold me close to you.

306
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,904
I'm yours.

307
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,732
Take me -
that's what's written there.

308
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,658
Yes, take me.

309
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,122
Maybe your warmth can save me
from this cold that imprisons me

310
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,777
hopelessly.

311
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:15,342
Take me, kiss me,
my love.

312
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,521
Alan, I'm alive
only when I love.

313
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,802
Bitch! I knew it.

314
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,753
I knew
it would end with this.

315
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,375
- Where are you going?
- Let me go.

316
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,124
This doesn't concern you.

317
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,022
I still love her.
Don't do this.

318
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,608
Why? So that I can always be
treated like this?

319
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,529
Herbert must know about it,
immediately!

320
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,098
We met each other too late.

321
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,687
My love, the main thing
is that I've found you.

322
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,033
Now we'll be together always.

323
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,734
Always separated.

324
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,338
I, in my world, and you...

325
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,222
in yours, far from here.

326
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,352
My world will be yours, Elisabeth.

327
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,553
I can't go back.
I don't belong to it anymore.

328
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:33,831
- What is it, Alan?
- I was so frightened.

329
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,248
It seemed as if
your head wasn't beating.

330
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,512
My head doesn't beat.

331
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,849
It hasn't beaten for ten years.

332
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:51,081
I am dead.

333
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,905
It's not possible!

334
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,665
Yes, everything is possible, tonight.

335
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,419
Don't worry about Elisabeth.

336
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,694
But she's disappeared.

337
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,550
She'll come back.

338
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,257
She's wounded. We must take care of her.

339
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,368
- It's useless.
- Useless?

340
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,081
You're all mad here.
When will you understand that...

341
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:33,736
She's already being taken care of.
Trust me.

342
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,470
Who are you?

343
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,896
- I am Dr. Carmus.

344
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:45,167
- The famous medical researcher?

345
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,817
We had no news of you for some time.
We thought you were...

346
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,485
Dead?

347
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,207
I stopped living a futile existence

348
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:59,302
in a world that made it impossible
for me to complete my studies.

349
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,289
You have had a shock.

350
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,239
You need to drink something strong.

351
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,961
There's a stock
of excellent whisky in my study.

352
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,528
Sit down.

353
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,679
Relax, Foster.

354
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,428
- Your name is Foster, isn't it?
- How did you know?

355
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,775
I heard you speaking
with Elisabeth.

356
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:37,596
- You...
- Yes, I saw everything.

357
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,103
I heard everything,

358
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,442
but there was no way for me
to intervene.

359
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,623
You'll understand why.

360
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:00,251
Sit down, relax, and drink your whisky.

361
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,378
I don't understand.

362
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,559
It's as if I were living
in a nightmare.

363
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,162
Yet I'm convinced, I'm sure, that
Elisabeth is alive.

364
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,898
I felt her body trembling,
I felt her warmth.

365
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,937
At this moment, she's alive
thanks to the power of her senses

366
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,678
that do not wish to die.

367
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,695
What do you mean?

368
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:35,360
Three forms of life
exist together in every human being.

369
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,898
That of the body
is the most fragile form.

370
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,048
Next, there is the spirit,
which is indestructible.

371
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,858
Finally, there are the senses,
which are not eternal,

372
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:51,248
but which can survive
long after death.

373
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:55,058
Especially when a human being
is torn from life

374
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,685
by an act of violence

375
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,645
in a moment

376
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,528
when the senses are undergoing
an intense emotion.

377
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,889
In shod,
one does not entirely die

378
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,809
when one is not ready to die.

379
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,399
That is a totally absurd theory.

380
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:14,097
But I can demonstrate.

381
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,172
Be careful,
this reptile is very poisonous.

382
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,199
At this moment,
all its senses are mobilised

383
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,358
by a profound
instinct of defence.

384
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,015
Theoretically,

385
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,818
the snake should have died
when I struck the blow.

386
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,389
But it continues to live.

387
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,712
I did this experiment
when I was a child,

388
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,205
with lizards.

389
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:16,560
It's true, the body struggles for
a few seconds, but then...

390
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,168
There.

391
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:26,233
Now it has completely
ceased living.

392
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,662
Move your hand closer to it.

393
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,074
Be careful.

394
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,438
Its glands are still secreting
venom.

395
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:42,426
The reptile is dead, but
its defence instinct survives.

396
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,045
Not for long.

397
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,568
When the blood circulation stops,

398
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,729
decomposition begins,

399
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,383
leading to the death
of the sensory-motor system.

400
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:01,427
I don't believe your theory
can apply to human beings.

401
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,002
You should believe it,
because you've seen the proof of it.

402
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,137
You've seen Elisabeth.

403
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,499
You've spoken with her.

404
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:14,577
You've felt her body
trembling in your arms.

405
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,239
Yet,

406
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,529
Elisabeth is buried over there,

407
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,103
in the park cemetery.

408
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,275
And the others?

409
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,158
They too are buried there.

410
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,448
They are victims of
the same destiny.

411
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,495
What destiny?

412
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:35,008
Follow me, and you'll find out.

413
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,128
Soon, the dead

414
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,544
will relive once again
the final episode

415
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,694
of their earthly existence.

416
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,249
Only Lord Thomas's perversity

417
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,823
could have made you come here
tonight.

418
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:11,203
He takes after his great-grandfather,
the first Count of Blackblood.

419
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,374
Blackwood!

420
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,103
He took the name Blackwood.

421
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,938
"Wood" instead of "blood."

422
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:25,206
He was made a nobleman because
he hanged opponents of the Crown.

423
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,463
He was the executioner of London.

424
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,657
Don't be surprised, Foster.

425
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,609
You have many more things to see.

426
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,682
Doctor, I beg you,

427
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,383
tell me about Elisabeth.

428
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:50,332
It's time.
From now on, words are useless.

429
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,999
Look.

430
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:26,408
- Do you want something to drink?

431
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,089
- What do you want?
- Leave. Don't stay with him.

432
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,398
Wait for me in the stable.
Go.

433
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,145
I lost sight of you.

434
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,159
- I'm keeping an eye on her.

435
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:22,171
You took over for me while I was gone.
Now, it's my turn.

436
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,062
What a magnificent family portrait.

437
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:32,814
You're going?

438
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,365
Yes, I'm going back to London.

439
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,319
I have to work tomorrow,
and I hate not getting enough sleep.

440
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,297
Before, you used to get up early
to hunt. The city has changed you.

441
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,983
I've given up
the pleasure of hunting.

442
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:47,408
It's been a pleasure for me
to see you reunited again.

443
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,967
William,
try not to leave her alone anymore.

444
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,624
I've sold all my possessions
in America.

445
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,798
Now, I travel
only for pleasure.

446
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:01,915
What if we went on a cruise,
to visit France, Italy...

447
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,638
That's a good idea.

448
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:07,452
We'll come see you in London
and talk about it again.

449
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,264
- Let me.
- No, I can go with them.

450
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,028
Stay here with the other guests.

451
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:04,412
Goodbye, Elisabeth,
and have a good time hunting.

452
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,972
- Don't go back to him.
- Stop being stupid, he's my husband.

453
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,298
George, the coach!

454
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,464
Come on.

455
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,898
You can't go back to him.
You belong to me.

456
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,937
We love each other. We've experienced
unforgettable moments.

457
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,112
He'll go away again, Herbert
Let me go.

458
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,823
No. I know
you'll leave with him.

459
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,497
I'll kill you
if you go back to him!

460
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,183
 Let me go!

461
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,802
No, I don't want to.

462
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:35,633
What you have seen
belongs to the past of the Blackwoods.

463
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,462
And it is only a prologue.

464
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,068
The real tragedy begins now.

465
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,918
Come.

466
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,817
I am alive
only when I love.

467
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:51,152
Don't cry, Elisabeth.
I beg you.

468
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:56,212
It's all over. I'm here.
Don't cry anymore.

469
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,785
- Please, Elisabeth.
- Go away.

470
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,025
- Please.
- Go away.

471
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:05,313
- Don't push me away.
- I hate you, I despise you.

472
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,824
I like men, do you understand?

473
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,325
No, it's not true.

474
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:13,713
I hate you, you're a murderess!
Leave me alone.

475
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:18,146
I can't live with you anymore.

476
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,656
I won't leave you again.
We'll stay together forever.

477
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:44,321
I'd rather die.

478
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:48,752
You can't say that,

479
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:53,892
because I -
I love you, Elisabeth.

480
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,144
Stop!

481
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,303
Let me go, Carmus.

482
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,377
No one is holding you.
You are the prisoner of the present.

483
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,903
You cannot cross
the threshold of the past.

484
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:59,692
That's not true.
That's all a lot of nonsense.

485
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,462
The dead live
in another space,

486
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,978
in another dimension.

487
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,088
I must convince you.

488
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:11,457
Let me go, and I'll convince you
of the contrary, Carmus.

489
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,858
You're wrong again, Foster.

490
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,243
Look, there is nothingness
behind you.

491
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,658
Let me go.

492
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:26,272
Don't try to hide, Carmus.

493
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,328
Where are you, Carmus?

494
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:55,108
Show yourself, I beg you.

495
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:02,818
Tell Lord Thomas
he has won the wager.

496
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,033
I want to get out of here.
I can't stand it anymore.

497
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:19,306
Open it!
I know you're there. Open!

498
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,615
I've lost the wager.

499
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,569
I give up.

500
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,608
I'm going mad.

501
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,739
Look out, Carmus.

502
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,535
You have seen how and why

503
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:31,728
I died.

504
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:01,392
"Blood is the source of life:

505
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:05,252
only blood revives the dead!
We will drink your blood!"

506
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,009
Marvellous. Our first night
will be unforgettable.

507
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:59,192
A night of love and terror
if Lord Blackwood is telling the truth.

508
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,685
Don't leave me.

509
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,704
You are afraid, Mrs. Perkins?

510
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:09,523
Yes, I'm afraid of cheating on you
with a ghost.

511
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:14,798
Don't go in.

512
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,538
Don't go in.
Stop!

513
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,254
Let me do it.

514
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:48,318
Don't go up.
You'll be killed.

515
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:28,049
You want to keep me from leaving.
Very well.

516
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,105
You don't frighten me.

517
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,185
You're dead!

518
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,462
I'm alive.

519
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:51,565
What was it?

520
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:54,553
A ghost
spying on us through the keyhole.

521
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:58,992
- Don't be stupid. Go see.
- All right.

522
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:03,288
I'll be right back.

523
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:16,777
Now it's your turn,
Foster.

524
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:40,485
Your hour has struck.

525
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:04,097
Run away, Alan.
They want your blood.

526
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:07,642
I beg you, flee.

527
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:43,468
Follow me. Quickly.

528
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:19,742
In one hour, it will be dawn.

529
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:01,089
From now on,
you are in our hands.

530
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:04,233
You can't escape us.

531
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:07,729
Your fate is sealed.

532
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:20,758
We don't want to give up life.

533
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:36,923
Your blood will be our life.

534
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,165
Where were you?

535
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:49,903
Perhaps I can save you. Come.

536
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:52,623
- You're not with the others?
- I love you.

537
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:56,378
I've never loved anyone
as much as you.

538
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:57,709
But you're alive.

539
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:01,532
No, I wanted to be.
I beg you, run away.

540
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:03,495
Hurry, before it's too late.

541
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:05,574
They're coming.
Go through the park.

542
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:09,042
Your life will be safe
beyond the gate.

543
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:11,822
- Come with me.

544
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:17,382
You can't take me into a world
that is no longer mine.

545
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:21,747
Let me go.
I'm dead, you must understand.

546
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:25,777
No, you're alive.
Believe me, you're alive!

547
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:27,519
- Come.

548
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:30,005
Let me go, please!

549
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:32,993
I can't follow you!

550
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:38,503
Let me go!

551
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:43,208
- I can't go any further.

552
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:47,738
I beg you, let me go.

553
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,334
My love.

554
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:43,519
You can't escape us.

555
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:46,063
Your fate is sealed.

556
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:51,279
We don't want to give up life.

557
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:54,793
Now your blood is ours.

558
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,982
Your blood will be our life.

559
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:02,288
You won't escape.

560
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:27,457
You can't escape us, Alan!

561
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:18,569
He made it.
He's waiting for us in front of the gate.

562
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:20,569
Stop, Laster.

563
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:43,582
No one has ever
survived the night of the dead.

564
01:24:55,600 --> 01:25:00,071
Unfortunately, you've lost
the wager, my boy.

565
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:08,001
Let's go.
I'll have him buried in the park.

566
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,698
When I write this story,

567
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:21,266
no one will believe it.
As always.

568
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:41,498
Did you stay for me, Alan?

569
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,528
