00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:06,381

00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,446
(Country music in the background)

3
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:24,042
(Southern U.S. accent)
My name's Buck, I'm raring to fuck.

4
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,546
Let's just get it over with.

5
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:34,761
There ain't no hurry, I...
I paid for a whole hour.

6
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:42,852
Besides, I sort of thought
we could try something new.

7
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,985
My, my! You're a nice looking filly.

8
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,030
Nice legs...

9
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,783
Those nice big blue lamps.

10
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,995
Nice shoulders...

11
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:10,046
Hey, why don't you turn over
and get up on your knees, hm?

12
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,425
(Pats the bed) ...for old Buck.

13
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,176
Come on.

14
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,846
Come on.

15
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:30,567
I'm going to ride you like
you've never been rode before.

16
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,571
- What do you mean?
- I've got a surprise for you.

17
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,072
No!

18
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,617
- Don't tell me. I'm not gonna to do that!
- Yes, you are. Now come on!

19
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,536
- Stay up on those legs.
- No, I'm not!

20
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,288
- Come on!
- Stop it! No...

21
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,623
Get up on those knees!
Come here!

22
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,710
No! I'm not going to do that,
you stop it!

23
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:51,546
- Come on now, get those knees up!
- Please, don't!

24
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,256
- Come here!
- No!

25
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,050
There ain't no such word as no,
understand? Now, come here!

26
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,887
- Don't, no, no!
- Come on, now!

27
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,766
- Come on.
- Stop it! Get away!

28
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,642
- Shh!

29
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:08,146
Listen, all I want to do
is get what I paid for.

30
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:12,484
So you get back in this bed and you get up
on your knees. You hear me?

31
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,029
Get away!

32
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:19,741
(Screams) Miss Hattie! Miss Hattie!

33
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:23,620
No, don't, please don't!
Don't, don't!

34
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,247
(Screams)

35
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,250
What the hell is going on in here?

36
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,044
(Screams)

37
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,506
Miss Hattie, I wasn't doing nothing,
I swear to God, just what I paid for.

38
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:38,092
- That's all I want.
- I ain't gonna do what he wants.

39
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,261
Not for 20 dollars,
not for nothing!

40
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,389
What you carrying on for like that?
Buck's a good boy.

41
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,850
- He ain't gonna hurt you.
- Yes, ma'am!

42
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:49,187
I don't know. Maybe I'm just not
cut out to be a whore.

43
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,981
Now, Buck,
I'll tell you what you do.

44
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,609
You get your hat and go on downstairs

45
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:57,654
and you pick out
two of my very best girls.

46
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,447
- No extra charge.
- Two?

47
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,533
- That's right, two!
- For the price of one?

48
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:04,744
Exactly. That's a good boy.

49
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,955
Now, you look here.

50
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:10,124
I didn't ask you to come here.
You came here asking me.

51
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,920
Now, I took you in and I fed you
and I cleaned you up.

52
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,755
You don't want to work?

53
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:18,299
You just pack your bag
and get the hell out of here.

54
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,260
(Chatter and commotion)

55
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:27,600
...right now. I got no use for those who
don't work for their keep. Get, get, get.

56
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,811
My bag.

57
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:33,064
- Ruby! Ruby! Where is that girl?
- Yes, Miss Hattie.

58
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:36,025
Get this tramp's bag.
I want her out of here right now.

59
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,195
You wait out on the front porch.
Go on! Get!

60
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:45,535
Get on up there, now. Miss Hattie says
I gets two and I picks you.

61
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,788
(Laughing) We're going to have
so much fun!

62
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,125
Damn fools.

63
00:04:56,671 --> 00:05:01,301
Lord, child! You sure got yourself
in a heap of trouble.

64
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:05,763
Miss Hattie chased you out.
You've barely been here.

65
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:10,727
And now Buck.
He'd have made me mad.

66
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,980
Funny business, smart ales,
sassy mouth.

67
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,775
Where are you going to go now, child?

68
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,778
I don't know but I'll be all right.

69
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:25,783
- Got any money?
- I'll be all right, Ruby.

70
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,956
- You take this.
- No, I can't Ruby, I can't take it.

71
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,376
You take this.
There's a place right down the road.

72
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,003
I think it's called The Starlight.

73
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:40,340
But just don't go out there
telling them you're from Miss Hattie's.

74
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,300
Now you take this...

75
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,178
Take it!

76
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:52,727
Thanks! I'll pay you back,
I promise.

77
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,105
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

78
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,609
You're no trouble.
No trouble at all.

79
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,737
Some girls just ain't cut out
for things like this.

80
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,450
Now you best be on your way.
You take care, hear?

81

85

Hello?

86
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,197
Is somebody...?

87
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,616
(Music continues in the background)

88
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,124
Hello?

89
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:41,127
I'm kind of lost
and I saw your sign.

90
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,337
Are you Open?

91
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,719
Hello?

92
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,854

(Footsteps)

95
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,453
- Uh, what...?
- Do you have a room?

96
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:19,415
Oh, er... yes.

97
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:26,464
(Distant hooting and chirping)

98
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:36,516
Oh, no, no... Over here.

99
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,936
There. Yeah, here.

100
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,191
(Pencil scratching the paper)

101
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,906

102
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,577
(Laughs gently) Yeah.

103
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:00,832
Oh, no ma'am.
Pay in the morning.

104
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,501
(Splashing outside)

105
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,842
Oh, you've seen it, huh?

106
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:16,097
That ain't no ordinary gator.
That's a croc!

107
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:21,185
Gators, they can't move fast
unless they're in the water.

108
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:25,356
Old croc now... not the same.
Outrun a horse.

109
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:30,528
Oh, upstairs, ma'am.
Go ahead. Go ahead.

110
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:38,077
Yeah. Got out of there one day
and chased down a nigger mule.

111
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:41,873
Ha-ha! Tore it half in two
before it hit the ground.

112
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:47,003
Front part still screaming.
Head and legs for 50 yards.

113
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,213
(Laughs loudly)

114
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:55,261
That old croc made no distinctions.
Not at all. Eats anything. Anything at all.

115
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,637
(Creepy music box melody)

116
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,265

(Shrieks)

124
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,449
Whore!

125

162
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,218
(Dog barking)

163
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:52,970
Snoopy!

164
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,098
How do you do, sir?

165
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,935
Oh... Oh, can't complain.

166
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:04,273
No siree, can't say as I can.

167
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,151
I wonder if I might use
your restroom?

168
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:11,322
Oh, well, yes, help yourself.

169
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,574
- Snoopy! Come on, Snoopy!
- Where is it?

170
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,284
Right in there.

171
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,579
Go up those stairs there
and you turn to your right.

172
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:19,663
Snoopy!

173
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,665
- In there, go on.
- Appreciate it.

174
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,216
How do you do, ma'am?

175
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,385
Oh, just fine, thank you.

176
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,221
How far is it to Tyler?

177
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,267
Oh, about an hour, I reckon.

178
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,604
(Car approaching)

179
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:45,981
Old man!

180
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,775
(Laughing over country music)

181
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:52,154
Get! Get on out of here!

182
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,365
(Horn blaring)

183
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:57,034
You got a paying customer here
needs some service!

184
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,453
Get that junk off my property!

185
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,664
Old Buck done work his magic again.

186
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,334
Old Buck goes to work, ain't a woman
alive who stands a chance. Ain't no way!

187
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,252
- You get out of here.
- No way!

188
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:11,799
- I've got folks here. Real folks!
- In the saddle riding high again!

189
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:16,887
I've got me some sure enough hot stuff
ripe and ready for the picking.

190
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,847
Yee-haw!

191
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:23,394
How do, ma'am.
The name's Buck.

192
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:26,814
I told you I don't want you
coming around here. I told you!

193
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,315
(Piercing sound)

194
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:31,985
Don't pay him no mind. He gets his
dander a bit... Don't mean nothing.

195
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,905
Look at that. He got
himself all riled up again.

196
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,699
That's it, put it down.

197
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,201
Mark it down, mark it.

198
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,162
Here you go, old man.

199
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,583
Now, you best get out of here,
right now. Go on, get!

200
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,836
Get! Get out of here!

201
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:53,465
(Laughs) You can count on that.
But I'll be back before long.

202
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,759
Take it to the bank.

203
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,721
(Car engine and radio)

204
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:05,060
(Grumbles) Won't have it. No... no, sir.

205
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,064
I won't, I won't.

206
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,743
Come and go, come and go,
it's all it is.

207
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,792
Tell it, and I tell it, and I tell it!

208
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,757
- It don't sit right with me.
- Monkey, wake up!

209
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,550
Think I don't know.

210
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:40,596
Ha! Don't need eyes for that!

211
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,015
No, sir.

212
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,810
Mommy, Mommy!
It's dead, Mommy!

213
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,729
What, sweetheart?
What's the matter?

214
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,982
The little monkey's dead
in its cage. See?

215
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,737
Pitiful little creature.

216
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,864
(Dog barks)

217
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,784
I'm sorry, baby.

218
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,705
Your monkey's dead.

219
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,373
(Grumbles)

220
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,752
(Barking continues)

221
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,804
Well... I reckon that's that.

222
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,056
(Crocodile grunting)

223
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,356
- (Barking and grunting)
- Snoopy!

224
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,237
Snoopy!

225
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:42,199
- Oh my God!
- Come here!

226
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,701
Angie! Angie, no!

227
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,578
Angie!

228
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,374
(Squealing and screaming)

229
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,714
Folks! In here!

230
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:01,009
(Angie screams)

231
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:05,013
Here folks! That old croc,
he'll eat anything. Go in here! In here.

232
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:14,064
He'll eat anything. Weren't no harm
done. There's nobody hurt.

233
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:17,401
- Is there a place we can lay her down?
- Upstairs, upstairs.

234
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:23,490
Ain't nothing no one can do about it.
All according to the instincts.

235
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:31,498
(Babbling) Make no distinctions.
None at all.

236
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:36,295
- (indistinct babbling)
- The door!

237
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:39,047
It's OK, baby. Here we go.

238
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:43,385
- Would you excuse us, please?
- Oh, yes. Ma'am. Surely, yes sir.

239
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,388
Did you see that thing?

240
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,226
All right, all right.

241
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,437
(Sobbing)

242
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,731
It's OK, baby.

243
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,441
Angie, calm down.

244
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,401
Calm down!

245
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,862
(Creepy music box melody)

246
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,908
Calm down!

247
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,453
Snoopy!

248
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,288

(Footsteps)

253
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,615
(Distant crying)

254
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,720
Things happen.

255
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:15,018
All according to instincts.

256
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:28,448
There ain't none.
There ain't no distinctions.

257
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,664
Distinctions.

258
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:41,253
None at all.

259
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:51,930
You've gotta do what...

260
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:54,307
...what you gotta do.

261
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,735
(Angie whimpers)

262
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,240
It's gonna be OK.

263
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:21,585
Is she all right, honey?

264
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,880
Snoopy!

265
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,800
What do you expect?

266
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,430
I'm sorry!

267
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:39,478
I didn't... I'm sorry.

268
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:42,522
Baby, honey, I'm sorry.

269
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:47,611
I'm sorry.

270
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:52,866
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry
that this whole thing happened.

(Anguished wail)

273
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,619
I don't know...
I don't know what you expect.

274
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:43,416
Nothing.

275
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:50,549
I don't expect you to do nothing.

276
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:54,010
(Country music)

277
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:59,850

(Woman, quarrelling)
'You don't even have a job.'

281
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,494
- 'I have a job!'
- 'You did not have a job...'

282

(Country music)

286
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:55,298
Yes sir, what can I do for you?

287
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:58,260
We need a couple of rooms,
for my daughter and myself.

288
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,762
Oh, right in here, right in here.

289
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:09,854
Right here, you've got to sign right here.

290
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:18,405
Let's see... Rooms three and six,
top of the stairs right there, sir.

291
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,661
(Discordant sound)

292
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:29,708
No, no. Don't have none
of that here.

293
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,085
You've got to go to the
local prostitution home.

294
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,841
You've seen this girl there?

295
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:43,388
I've seen them there.
I won't have nothing to do with it at all.

296
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:47,267
I mean, this girl.
You've actually seen her?

297
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,561
I done said all I've got to say.

298
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:52,856
Because if you've seen her,
I need to know about it.

299
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:57,110
All right. At least tell me
how I can find this place.

300
00:28:57,193 --> 00:29:00,822
I'm not looking for trouble.
I just have to locate this girl.

301
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,907
She happens to be my daughter.

302
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:07,746
Dad, please,
we can see to it later.

303
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:16,379
All right. You keep it to yourself,
old timer. See where it will get you.

304
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,800
Thank you.

305
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:24,721
Please, it's just been one
of those days, please excuse us.

306
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:34,147
Dad? Dad are you all right?

307
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,943
- What are you doing?
- You'll feel better when you get inside

308
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,071
- and lie down.
- I'm not going inside

309
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,323
I'm going to check
this thing out right now.

310
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:47,827
- Please, it can wait.
- Ma'am, can I help you?

311
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,705
It's the least I can do,
I feel awful bad about it.

312
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,958
- Yeah...
- Coming or staying? I'm going into town.

313
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,961
Thank you. We'll be back later, OK?

314
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:01,257
Maybe you're right. Got to get
something to eat, anyway.

315
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:51,307
Why don't you just take that cigarette
and grind it out in my eye?

316
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:58,523
Was that your eye?
Oh, honey, I thought it was an ashtray!

317
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:01,901
Oh, did I burn you?

318
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:05,864
No, you didn't burn me, no,
you just gouged my eye out.

319
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,908
She just gouged my eye out.
No, wait a second...

320
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:13,246
(Laughs) No, you didn't do that.
No, you didn't.

321
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:16,124
You did! You did!
There's a hole there.

322
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,918
You did! You gouged my eye out.

323
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,087
Where is it?

324
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:26,134
Where is it? Where did she put it?
Where did it roll to? Honey?

325
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,636
Honey, where did it roll to?

326
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:35,935
Let's just take... soon take that eye
and scrunch it up!

327
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:44,861
Roy? I didn't say anything,
and I didn't mean anything,

328
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:48,573
and I don't know why
you're being so ridiculous.

329
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:52,619
Now, you just stop it!

330
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:57,790
OK, OK, I'll stop it.

331
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,919
I'll just stop it.

332
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:03,046
(crying)

333
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:12,514
(Barking noise)

334
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,933
Stop it! Stop it!

335
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,434
(Barking noises)

336
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:19,145
(Shouting) Roy, stop it!

337
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,527
Stop it!

338
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,405
(Angie whimpers)

339
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:35,119
Roy, what do you want me to do?

340
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:40,625
Throw myself to the alligators?
ls that what you want, huh?

341
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:47,090
Is that what you want me to do?

342
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,094
(Hissing)

343
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,233
(Door slams)

344
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:14,701
Can't pretend it never happened!

345
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:19,080
What? Oh, sir, got no call.

346
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:24,544
Look, it's all according to the
instincts. There was no harm done.

347
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:31,801
No... Oh, no sir, no sir,
there ain't no call.

348
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:38,349
No, that ain't no common gator.
He's come all the way from Africa.

349
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:42,270
They don't come from around here.
Don't come from around here at all.

350
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:45,481
Frank Buck, Frank Buck,
you know about him?

351
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:49,444
"Bring 'Em Back Alive" Frank Buck,
they call him.

352
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,404
Come from up at Gainesville.

353
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:54,949
They've got him a statue
that looks just like him.

354
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,285
Every kind of animal in that zoo.

355
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:00,747
He's the one! I got it from him.
You know, he told me, he says,

356
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:06,461
you know, them things, ain't nobody
knows how old... they don't never die.

357
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:09,714
- Oh, sir! Sir!
- Sir!

358
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,716
That thing is dangerous!

359
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:14,093
Now, it attacked my child.

360
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:18,056
I'm going to see to it that I destroy it,
and I would advise you not to interfere.

361
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:22,060
Oh, just you wait. Get me the uniform.

362
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:27,982
Give me the uniform.
Tell them to give the signal.

363
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,902
There ain't nobody knows.
Nobody knows.

364
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:36,866
Most likely never.
Won't never be the way things are...

365
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:41,412
Creature can't go against himself.

366
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:44,207
(High-pitched beeping)

367
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,004
- Snoopy!
- Daddy's off to slay the dragon.

368
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,798
(Shouting) Ah!

369
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:54,217
(Sudden discordant tune)

370
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,219
(Gunshot)

371
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:04,394
(Laughing)

372
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,152
(Screaming)

373
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,988
(Grunting)

374
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,044
Daddy took care of everything.

375
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,715
Go to sleep, baby.

376
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,594
(Sighs)

377
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,807
(Country music in the background)

378
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:52,400
Oh, Oh...

379
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,613
(Groaning)

380
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:52,293
That BC makes me feel
better already.

381
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,868
(Wooden sound)

382
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:30,748
(laughs)

383
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:03,155
Roy! Hey! You bring up that suitcase!

384
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,288
Where is he, anyway?

385
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:14,709
Oh, he'll be up in a minute, ma'am.
In a minute.

386
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,952
(Water running)

387
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,101
(Sighs)

388
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:24,273
(Country music in the background)

389
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,671
My God! What are you doing in here?

390
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,465
Get out of here!

391
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:52,510
- I seen it.
- Roy?

392
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,637

393
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,650
(Screams)

394
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,238
(Shouts) Mummy?

395
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,406
(Muffled cries)

396

(Screaming) Please, somebody!

414
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,584
Somebody!

415

Oh, please. Please.

416
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:54,423
Please?

417
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:56,258

(Sudden piercing sound)

425
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:53,857
They... done shot up my leg.

426
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,987
Didn't hurt nothing much.

427
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,448
Give me a scare.

428
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:08,122
Little girl she done run
under my place.

429
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:13,585
I suspect I gotta go in there
and pull her out.

430
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:20,217
Well, I... best, I go on.

431
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:30,769
Oh... I... didn't catch his name.

432
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:36,650
I never put it down. Yeah.

433
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:41,822
Put...
Put the letters down...

434
00:45:44,033 --> 00:45:46,410
...put the numbers down...

435
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:48,954
...and all such as that.

436
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,792
All according to the regulations. Yeah.

437
00:45:55,419 --> 00:46:00,299
Regulations say that
that's the way it's gotta go.

438
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,344
I know the rules...

439
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:07,765
I know the rules
and I bided by 'em.

440
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:09,892
(Croaking)

441
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:24,990
There. Oh, there...

442
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,203
There, now. There.

443
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:37,252
They come at me,
they come at me.

444
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:46,720
Give me my uniform,
find me the hat.

445
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:52,309
Here it is, put it on, get to it!

446
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:58,148
And by God, that's that.
Come at me.

447
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:04,947
Think they ain't got to abide
by the rules.

448
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:08,659
Think I don't know.
Think I don't see.

449
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:13,288
You don't need eyes for that.
No, sir.

450
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,085
Judd knows...

451
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:21,296
He knows what he knows.

452
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:26,260
They laugh, laugh...

453
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:31,056
Old fool... fool,
and I don't wanna hear it

454
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,685
And by God I ain't going to neither.

455
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:38,230
They come at me.
I give them the signal.

456
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,819
They know what that means.

457
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:52,953
That means get and get
or by God you're done for. Done.

(Police radio in the background)

464
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:37,247
- Are you Sheriff Martin?
- That's right, what can I do for you?

465
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:40,250
I understand you run
a wide-open town, Martin.

466
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,961
- Dad, please.
- ls that right?

467
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:45,547
Well, there might be some folks
over there at Huntsville

468
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:49,676
would be glad to argue that with you.
I'd be mighty surprised to hear it.

469
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,013
- Is that so?
- Well, that's the way I hear it.

470
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:56,725
Well, I'd like you to tell me.
I'd like to hear it from you.

471
00:48:56,808 --> 00:49:00,562
Just what the hell do you call this bawdy
house thing you've got going down here?

472
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,272
Bawdy house?

473
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,316
You know damn well
what I'm talking about.

474
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:06,818
Why don't you just simmer down?

475
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:11,573
You get off that high horse of yours
and maybe we'll get down to something.

476
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:13,909
Ma'am, how do you do?

477
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:15,452
Fine, thanks.

478
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:19,164
Why don't you explain to me
what this is all about?

479
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:21,708
Well, my sister, she...

480
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:26,755
She disappeared some time ago.
We've been trying to locate her.

481
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:29,800
The man from the hotel,
old hotel outside of town,

482
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:32,844
- the one with the crocodile.
- Old Judd?

483
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:35,722
- Well, we checked in there.
- Miss...

484
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:39,518
- Libby... Libby Wood.
- OK, Miss Libby Wood.

485
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:43,188
Why don't you take your daddy back
to the hotel and get him all calmed down?

486
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:45,649
We'll look into this
first thing in the morning.

487
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:48,402
We'll look into it right now.
If my little girl's out there,

488
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:51,280
I don't want her to spend
another night in that place.

489
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:54,157
You figure she's over there
at Miss Hattie's?

490
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:57,452
Damn it! I don't figure!
I gotta know!

491
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:02,708
All right. I'll take you over there
and put your mind at ease.

492
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:05,502
And, ma'am, why don't you
go on back to the hotel there.

493
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:09,798
I'll drop your daddy off at Miss Hattie's,
and... we'll look into it.

494
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:11,550
I'm going with you.

495
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:16,096
Miss Hattie's liable to be real surprised
to see you walk in there with us...

496
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:21,351
Well, if that's the way you want it,
why, OK. Come on, we'll take my car.

497
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:24,980
(Croaking)

498
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:29,067
(Country music in the background)

499
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:38,744
(Night swamp sounds)

500
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:43,665
(Splashing)

501
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:46,835
(High-pitched sounds)

502
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:55,761
(Footsteps)

503
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:49,356
(High-pitched sounds)

504
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,006
(Knocking)

505
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:21,596
Mister Martin! How do you do?
Come on in!

506
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,282
What is it?

507
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:43,326
Miss Hattie? Mister Martin
and some friends out hereto see you.

508
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:46,496
Show them on in!
Show them in!

509
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,373
Come in folks.

510
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:51,668
Martin, is that you? Where the hell
you been keeping yourself?

511
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:54,087
- How are you, Hattie?
- Just fine. How are you?

512
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,715
I got some friends here
wanna have a little word with you.

513
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:59,718
How do you do, folks?
Just sit right down.

514
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:01,678
Make yourselves right at home.

515
00:53:01,762 --> 00:53:05,390
My name is Rebecca.
Folks call me Hattie.

516
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:07,809
- Where you folks from?
- Houston.

517
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,519
Houston...

518
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:13,440
Say, would you be interested
in a real good buy?

519
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:16,276
I got a little piece of property
up at the Heights.

520
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:19,613
I could sell it to you real cheap.
Course, it needs a little fixing up.

521
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:23,450
But lots of folks moving in there,
young folks fixing things up.

522
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:24,951
Hattie?

523
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:28,288
This is Mr Harvey Wood.

524
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,373
How do you do?
Pleased to meet you.

525
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,959
- And his daughter, Libby.
- Hi.

526
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:38,131
Now, Mr Woods believes that
you're acquainted with his daughter.

527
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,217
Never saw her before in my life!

528
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:44,596
Dad, you wanna go now?
Let's get something to eat.

529
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:48,433
- Where are you folks staying?
- Starlight Hotel.

530
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:51,353
Judd's! Ha! That old reprobate!

531
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:55,440
I didn't know he was still
taking folks in. Old goat!

532
00:53:55,524 --> 00:53:58,151
Place about to fall down, ain't it?

533
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:02,364
Old Judd used to be a regular around
here, but I had to run him off.

534
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:08,662
The old fool. All he wanted to do
was just look and talk his crazy fool talk.

535
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,914
Scared the girls, too.

536
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:12,999
Say, you know what he said?

537
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:18,171
He says that big gator of his
is really a crocodile from Africa.

538
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:23,134
He says those things don't die.
You've got to kill 'em.

539
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:28,974
He's the one that tore off old Judd's leg.
That's right, tore it clean off and ate it.

540
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:33,311
Hattie, these people
have had enough for today.

541
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:35,021
I'll take them back to the hotel.

542
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,732
Oh yes, well, I suspect you're right,
I get to talking.

543
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:41,027
Well, you folks come back
if you're ever this way now.

544
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,280
- Thank you. Nice meeting you.
- Yes, indeed.

545
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:45,657
If you think about that piece
of property now,

546
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,409
you can come up with it.
You'll like it.

547
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:49,953
It's got a big pecan tree
in the front yard.

548
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:52,914
- Bye, Hattie.
- Bye there, sweetheart.

549
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,376
Silly fools!

550
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:08,388
Ooh, little girl. Come on outta there.

551
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:12,851
Come on. Old Judd,
he ain't gonna hurt you.

552
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:19,107
No sirree, he won't.
He got something for you.

553
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,735
Look! Look here.

554
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:27,657
Come on outta there.

555
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:31,536
Come look at what old Judd
done brought you.

556
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:35,457
Mm-hm. Yes, ma'am. Look here.

557
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,712
Little girl...

558
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:51,306
(Squeaking and high-pitched sounds)

559
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:08,365
Aargh!

560
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:09,866
(Screams)

561
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:25,590
(laughs)

562
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:29,970
(Screams)

563
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,639
Mummy! Daddy!

564
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:40,063
(Screams)

565
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:04,796
- (Libby) 'Can I bring you anything?'
- (Harvey) 'No, no, I'm fine.'

566
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:06,965
(Libby) 'You sure you're not hungry?'

567
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:08,717
(Harvey) 'You run along. I'm fine.'

568
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,553
(Music box melody)

569
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,070
(Angie whimpers)

570
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:42,375
(Hooting and chirping)

571
00:57:55,764 --> 00:57:59,517
(Carillon sounds)

572
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:18,411
(Angie crying in the distance)
'Mummy!'

573
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,747
Who is it?

574
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:26,086
Who's there?

575
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:52,487
(Muffled cries)

576
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,838
(Sudden loud cry)

577
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:16,761
(High-pitched discordant sound)

578
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:23,476
(Choking)

579
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:14,277
(Choking and grunting)

580
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,804
Come on and get it.

581
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,308
Come on and get it!

582
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:47,060
Yes, they will.

583
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:52,649
They don't wanna hear what
old Judd's gotta tell them.

584
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:56,236
No, Judd's an old fool.

585
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,029
Yeah, he is.

586
01:00:58,112 --> 01:01:00,448
Set the dogs again, Major.

587
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:06,371
Shut up! Shut up! Ain't nobody
wanna hear your fool talk!

588
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:11,376
Think it's easy?

589
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:13,962
Think it's easy?

590
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:19,968
Weren't nobody tell them different.
No, sir, they don't.

591
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:25,765
No... No, sirree.

592
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:32,272
I guess we whopped them. 35 zip.

593
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:35,441
Shit! Them boys
never got inside our set.

594
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:39,737
Yes, that old colored boy there,
supposed to be so good -

595
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:42,198
won't go no place tonight.

596
01:01:42,282 --> 01:01:45,952
Coloured, hell!
Goddamn nigger if you ask me.

597
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:50,999
Showed them old boys
what it's all about.

598
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:52,750
- Yeah.
- Aw.

599
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:55,628
- Yeah, we did.
- I'd know where to go.

600
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:59,424
No need to get no stick after
me either. Not this old boy!

601
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:03,261
(Country music)

602
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:56,898
Hey, what you looking at?

603
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:00,693
What you looking at?

604
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:05,448
See something you like?

605
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:09,327
(indistinct)

606
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:19,337
Stand up man!

607
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:38,022
(Clapping)

608
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,949
Marlo, I believe you got a shot here.

609
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:07,343
- Tired, huh?
- Yeah.

610
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:12,473
Well, I could've saved you this trip.
I reckon I know how it is, though.

611
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:15,935
If it was my daughter,
I'd probably do the same thing.

612
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:19,230
- Thank you for being so patient.
- How long's it been?

613
01:04:21,149 --> 01:04:22,650
Your sister...

614
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:27,447
- Been a while?
- Yeah.

615
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:30,867
Coffee for two, and the lady
will have something to eat.

616
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:35,037
Excuse me sir, there's a boy back there
who don't seem to behave himself.

617
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:36,789
Well, who's that? Buck?

618
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:39,584
Yeah, but telling him
don't seem to do no good.

619
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:43,045
Tell him I got my eye on him. I don't
wanna hear another word out of him.

620
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:46,841
He gives you any trouble,
you come and tell me.

621
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,347
The police turn up anything?

622
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:56,767
Nothing, huh?

623
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:59,061
No, nothing.

624
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:03,316
There's more to it than that.
Dad's very sick...

625
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:06,736
A very sick man.
It's just a question of time.

626
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,786
What are you having?

627
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:19,207
I'll have that chicken
fried steak, please.

628
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:21,626
And you keep the coffee coming.

629
01:05:29,217 --> 01:05:31,636
He can be a hard man.

630
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:34,722
When she left, Dad said good riddance.

631
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:40,561
But the things he's been through this past
year have made him a different man.

632
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:44,482
He's dying and he's obsessed
with finding her.

633
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:49,570
He's spent a fortune
on private detectives,

634
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:55,368
chased all over the country himself...
when he's not in hospital.

635
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:59,664
(Buck) 'Yee-haw.
Shittin' and a gettin'!'

636
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:04,168
Excuse me just a minute.
Better go have a word with that boy.

637
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:17,890
Hey, fella. I think it's time
for you to pack it in.

638
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:20,434
- I ain't doing nothing.
- No.

639
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:23,187
I suppose that girl
is drinking Coca-Cola.

640
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:26,232
It ain't hurting nothing.
What's it to you?

641
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:29,193
Now, you just move on out now.
Take her along with you.

642
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:32,405
- You understand?
- All right, all right.

643
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:34,824
All right.

644
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:38,327
Got a burr up your ass,
don't make a shit to me.

645
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:40,955
Now, you got a fat mouth, kid.

646
01:06:41,038 --> 01:06:46,168
One more word out of you and I'm gonna
haul your ass in. You understand that?

647
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:48,087
Yes, sir.

648
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:56,554
Take off your star, you egg sucker!

649
01:07:00,891 --> 01:07:03,728
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

650
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:05,855
- See something here you like?
- No.

651
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:08,399
- Something you wanna say?
- I don't wanna say anything.

652
01:07:08,482 --> 01:07:10,318
- Hey, Buck.
- I didn't do anything to you.

653
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:13,863
- Come on, let's go.
- Watch who you're fooling with, OK?

654
01:07:13,946 --> 01:07:15,740
Come on, Buck.

Hey, old man!
Chicken done come home to roost.

659
01:07:45,686 --> 01:07:47,980
- Get, get!
- Bringing the bacon home!

660
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:51,359
I told you. I told you,
I don't want you coming around here.

661
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:53,319
Now get on outta here.

662
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:58,282
Get off my property.
Get off my property!

663
01:07:58,366 --> 01:08:01,118
Aw, look at that,
done ruffled his feathers.

664
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:04,288
I'm Lynette. You're cute.
Did anybody ever tell you that?

665
01:08:04,372 --> 01:08:05,748
I said get, get, get!

666
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:08,125
I won't have none of it.
Now get outta here!

667
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:09,960
Ain't he cute, Buck.

668
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:14,048
Oh, don't pay him no mind.
He's jealous. I know about you.

669
01:08:14,131 --> 01:08:16,133
- What?
- Think you scare people but you don't.

670
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:18,928
They know you're sweet.
You are. I know you are.

671
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:21,722
You just act mean so people
don't know you're soft-hearted.

672
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:23,599
See, you know it's true.

673
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:28,020
I'm full up. I got no room.
Now get outta here.

674
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:31,982
You took my money, you old fart.
I may have to do what Miss Hattie says.

675
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:36,320
Take a stick of dynamite and shove it
up that old croc's ass of yours.

676
01:08:36,404 --> 01:08:39,281
Now you pay me some mind.
Come on.

677
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:46,872
Rutting and rutting.

678
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:50,292
Do it right there in the dirt,
they got a mind to.

679
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:53,462
Don't make no difference.

680
01:08:54,755 --> 01:08:58,426
Get it in their heads to do it
and it don't make no difference.

681
01:08:59,343 --> 01:09:01,470
Won't have it.

Sheriff, I just...

684
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:27,204
Libby. A lot of kids these days
are running away from home.

685
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:29,999
She'll turn up.
You just wait and see.

686
01:09:30,082 --> 01:09:33,419
- I hope you're right.
- Tell you what I'll do.

687
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:36,464
I'll send out
an APB on her right now.

688
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:38,758
I'd really appreciate it.

689
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:43,179
You look tired.
Go on back to the hotel.

690
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:46,015
If you need me,
you get in touch with me.

What's that?

708
01:12:58,749 --> 01:13:01,377
It's nothing. Come here.
Just don't pay no mind to it.

709
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:03,253
It's nothing.

Don't you fret.
