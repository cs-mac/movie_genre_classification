1
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:20,208
Go on, do your prayers, Eddie. Go on.

2
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:27,716
God bless Mama and Daddy
and the farm. Amen.

3
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,854
- Mama.
- Mmm-hmm?

4
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:45,442
- What's wrong with Daddy tonight?
- Nothing, Eddie.

5
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:48,570
You mind me and you go
right to sleep, you hear?

6
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,349
Will it be all right?

7
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:01,768
Should I be afraid?

8
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:09,911
Tom Harley. Open up, Tom.
It's me, Clayton Heller. Tom.

9
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,341
Please open the door.

10
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,836
For God's sakes, Tom.
Open up, please!

11
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,922
It's after me, Tom.
It's gonna get me.

12
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:24,425
God in heaven, Tom.
We can't just sit here.

13
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:28,554
We have to, Ellie. This has
nothing to do with us.

14
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,599
What kind of a Christian
are you, for God's sakes?

15
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,768
- You got to help me, Harley!
- Tom.

16
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:36,270
- Mama.
- See to the boy.

17
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,106
Tom, it's gonna get me if
you don't open the door!

18
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:41,901
For God's sake, please help me! Tom.

19
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,821
Why doesn't Daddy let the man in?

20
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:49,959
- Please open the door!
- He can't, baby. He just can't.

21
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:57,800
Get away from my door.

22
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,629
- Get away from me and my family!
- Tom, please!

23
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,767
You got to help me, Tom.

24
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:10,430
It's coming. I didn't kill that girl.

25
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:13,182
I don't know nothing about that,
and I don't want to.

26
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,977
They said I did, Tom. But I didn't.

27
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:20,398
Now, I'm sorry. I am. But I can't
risk my family for you, Clayton.

28
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,109
Now, I got my shotgun here.

29
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,163
Get away. Get away
afore I have to use it.

30
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:29,183
Gypsy, ready? Ready?

31
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,480
Pick it up. Come here. Come on.

32
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:39,736
All right, ready? Go get it.

33
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,202
Come on.

34
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:04,177
Now, young man, come up here.

35
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:10,049
- I thank you. What've you been doing?
- Playing with Gypsy.

36
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,592
Mmm-hmm.

37
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,728
That's good.

38
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:18,099
You know something?
When I was your age,

39
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,060
your great-grandmama
used to wash my hands.

40
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:25,606
And she was so old that the skin on
her hands was thin as tissue paper.

41
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,909
It felt so good.

42
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,780
Guess what?

43
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:37,201
Last one in the house will get the
privilege of washing the breakfast dishes.

44
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:39,504
Get out of town.

45
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,177
Come on, Gypsy.

46
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:06,606
- Not at the table, Billy.
- But he's awful hungry, Daddy.

47
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,950
Put it in the bowl.

48
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,212
- Is it story time?
- I reckon.

49
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:24,590
Wait. I got to get something.

50
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:30,254
- Daddy?
- Hold on.

51
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:33,266
- I made you a present.
- You did?

52
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:37,812
I like presents.

53
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:42,859
Oh, well. Now, this is something.

54
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,988
It goes around your neck.

55
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:50,066
This is something special.

56
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:53,027
- You really like it?
- I love it.

57
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:56,656
You don't have to wear it every day
or nothing. Just when it strikes you.

58
00:10:56,657 --> 00:11:00,918
Give me a hug. I ain't
never taking it off, punk.

59
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,578
All right, now, wait a minute.

60
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,998
Once upon a time,
there was this scruffy old man,

61
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:09,927
and you know, he was one of
them yes-and-no kind of guys.

62
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:13,673
So anyhow, he was very proud
'cause he had this very clever son,

63
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,216
and he knew that one day,

64
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:18,594
this son was gonna grow up
to be something very special.

65
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,688
So, and one day...

66
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:27,728
Really, Tracy. You know, Joel is a
great guy once you get to know him.

67
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,281
Honey, get me a beer.

68
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:41,992
So how much further is
it to the cabin, Steve?

69
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,878
About 50 miles.

70
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:50,334
Why do you always have to
carry that stupid rifle with you?

71
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:54,222
'Cause you never know what you're
gonna find in the jungle, yo.

72
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,850
- Sorry.
- Thank you, klutz.

73
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,661
Okay, come on.

74
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,891
- Let her rip.
- Now?

75
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:42,270
Get the potatoes, kid.

76
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,529
Sweet potatoes.
Come on, get it over there.

77
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,488
- Wait, Steve, pull over.
- What?

78
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:04,241
- I want to take a picture of this.
- These people can get pretty weird, Trace.

79
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:08,078
We heard a story a couple years
ago about a guy who killed his wife

80
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,289
and ate her just to get
rid of the evidence.

81
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,916
- Yeah.
- That's disgusting.

82
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:15,044
No, the cops found, like,
her foot or something in this big pot

83
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:18,422
with all these carrots and onions.
It was like foot stew.

84
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:21,550
You know, I think this
was the guy, too.

85
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,936
This was the guy.

86
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:29,692
Get a few more of these. Here you go.
Get a few more of them, boy.

87
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,853
All right, here we are.

88
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:35,606
- Where?
- Downtown Bradley Mountain.

89
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:38,951
Cabin's the next stop.
Just a few miles from here.

90
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:40,736
- Kimbo.
- Yeah?

91
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,872
Help me out.

92
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:48,494
This is your last chance to shop, lady.
Breathe deep. The air is clean.

93
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:52,164
- You guys are animals.
- Civilization is behind us.

94
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,216
No, Gypsy!

95
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,710
- Hook shot.
- No, Gypsy.

96
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:00,139
- Whoa! Nice dog.
- No.

97
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,433
Gypsy!

98
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,762
Made a friend there
already, huh, Joel?

99
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:07,847
Gypsy, no.

100
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:10,558
Check out this kid's glasses.
We're talking Coke bottles.

101
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,184
Jesus.

102
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,821
- What? All I said was...
- We heard you, man.

103
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,283
Come on, Scratch. Let's do it.

104
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:30,661
- What's your name?
- Billy. This is my dog Gypsy.

105
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:32,705
Hey, Gypsy. How're you doing?

106
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,799
Hey, Gypsy.

107
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,668
Come on. I thought we were gonna
get everyone settled in first.

108
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:42,339
Listen. If you want to stay here and play
with the vegetables, that's fine with me.

109
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,841
I'm going.

110
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:46,519
Fetch, boy. Go get it.

111
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:53,776
- Come on, Gypsy. Come on. Come on.
- Yeah. Good dog. That a boy, Gypsy.

112
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,715
Come on.

113
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:19,460
Come on, Joe.

114
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:21,211
- Come on, Jimmy Joe.
- Shut up.

115
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:23,005
- You shut up.
- Stop it.

116
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:25,090
You young ones just
stay put now, you hear?

117
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,059
Yes, sir.

118
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,735
- What's that?
- It's a camera, stupid.

119
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:39,905
Yeah, it's my camera. See?

120
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:43,117
Hey, can I take your picture?

121
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,954
There you go.

122
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:49,573
Good afternoon, Mr. Wallace.
What do you know today?

123
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:50,991
No more than I did yesterday.

124
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:53,711
Honey. Honey.

125
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:57,673
- Do you have any beer, sir?
- No. No liquor.

126
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,043
- Hessie, look.
- What?

127
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:03,462
Jimmy Joe, you give that here.

128
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,464
Jimmy Joe gots the ball
and won't give it up.

129
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:09,226
Give it here. Give it.
Come on. Give it.

130
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,234
Jimmy Joe, you done bad.

131
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:20,312
Y'all know what settles
on bad ones, don't you?

132
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,731
- Pumpkinhead.
- Pumpkinhead.

133
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,359
Y'all stop.
There ain't no Pumpkinhead.

134
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,071
- What about old Mr. Foley?
- He moved away.

135
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,864
Uh-uh.

136
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,366
Pumpkinhead got him.

137
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,451
Teared off his head
and drank all the blood.

138
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:36,078
- Did not.
- Did too.

139
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,204
Shut up, Hessie!

140
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:40,833
"Keep away from Pumpkinhead
Unless you're tired of living

141
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:45,087
"His enemies are mostly dead
He's mean and unforgiving"

142
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,056
Stop it!

143
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:56,724
- Stop it!
- "Bolted doors and windows barred

144
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:59,226
- "Guard dogs prowling in the yard"
- Pumpkinhead. Pumpkinhead.

145
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:01,645
"Won't protect you till you're dead

146
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:06,150
"Nothing will, from Pumpkinhead
So keep away from Pumpkinhead"

147
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:08,536
- Stop it!
- Stop it!

148
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:14,783
I mean, well,
you've got him pretty scared.

149
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:17,503
- Pumpkinhead.
- All right.

150
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,968
Get in the truck. Come on.

151
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,346
Hey.

152
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:48,108
Come on.

153
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:50,661
Here you go, Billy.

154
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:56,166
I was just about to
say something myself.

155
00:17:57,368 --> 00:18:00,037
- That'll do it for you, Mr. Wallace?
- That and my feed.

156
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:02,915
Damn, I left it up at the house.
Give me a couple of minutes. Will you?

157
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,084
I ain't got it. I'm due back now.

158
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:07,586
Suppose I drop it off right at
your door? How'd that be?

159
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,004
Be there before dark.

160
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:20,432
Billy, bring Gypsy inside
out of the sun for a while.

161
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,526
Yes, Daddy.

162
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,481
- Got to admit, he's pretty good.
- He's a jerk.

163
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:29,942
Yeah, but he's a talented jerk.

164
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,319
Nah.

165
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,371
He's just a jerk jerk.

166
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:39,660
Billy, I want you to stay right
here and mind things, okay?

167
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:41,537
I got to fetch something
up at the house.

168
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:44,131
- Yes, sir, Daddy.
- Then we'll take us a little ride.

169
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,335
Do you have to encourage him?

170
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:52,222
Maggie, he's my brother.

171
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:59,772
Be a good boy, now.

172
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:11,158
- You man enough?
- Go for it!

173
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,889
Gypsy, no.

174
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:01,700
Little boy?

175
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,661
- Are you okay?
- Little boy?

176
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,463
What?

177
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,801
Gypsy!

178
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:25,733
No!

179
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,064
Jesus.

180
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:42,666
- Don't move him.
- He just came out of nowhere.

181
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:45,836
- Is he all right?
- He's cold.

182
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,550
It's gonna be okay, Billy.

183
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:56,597
All right, keep him warm.
Keep him warm.

184
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:59,341
- It's gonna be okay, little boy.
- Oh, God.

185
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:03,136
- Hey! Stay here.
- We got to do something.

186
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:05,814
You're gonna be fine.

187
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:12,145
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

188
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:14,648
We stay, I'm fucked, man.
Is that what you want?

189
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:16,400
It was an accident.
I almost hit him myself.

190
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:19,486
Yeah, but I've been drinking.
They'll fry me.

191
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:20,612
You got to help me, Scratch.

192
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,739
- Call an ambulance.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

193
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,625
Hurry!

194
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:28,620
- What are you doing? What are you doing?
- Get in the car.

195
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:32,508
- Get in the car. Get in the fucking car.
- No, we can't just leave him.

196
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,970
Damn it.

197
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:47,014
Joel, get back here!
Where the fuck is he going?

198
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:50,901
- Forget Joel.
- Forget... Fuck.

199
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:55,405
It'll be fine.
Everything's gonna be okay.

200
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:58,150
- Come on.
- Chris, did you get through?

201
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,736
- No phone.
- What about that guy at the stand?

202
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:02,988
He's gone, he's gone, he's gone!

203
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:07,200
Oh, God. Get to the cabin.
There's a phone over there.

204
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:10,427
It's all right. Chris.
Take care of her...

205
00:22:10,428 --> 00:22:12,831
- and I'll stay with the kid.
- Yeah.

206
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:16,793
Go help Chris with Maggie,
and I'll stay with the kid.

207
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:20,430
- Are you sure?
- I'll stay with him. Go! Go!

208
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:24,726
It's okay, Maggie. It's okay.

209
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,527
Go.

210
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,056
Billy?

211
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,608
Billy?

212
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:14,226
Gypsy.

213
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,696
Billy.

214
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,407
Gypsy.

215
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:46,716
Billy. Billy, Daddy's here.

216
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:06,620
It's okay.

217
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:21,927
Nobody saw him. It was
an accident. Can I help?

218
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:01,583
- Okay, Maggie, come on.
- Come on, Maggie.

219
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:04,878
Maggie, come on. Listen. Just get up
to the cabin and get on that phone.

220
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:05,962
I'm right behind you.

221
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:09,975
- I just stay on this trail?
- Yes, stay on the trail.

222
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:28,910
Did you call for help?

223
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:35,042
Jesus. This is crazy.

224
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:48,180
Damn you!

225
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,843
Jesus, he just ripped the
phone cord out of the wall.

226
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,220
What?

227
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:57,138
I'm going back. I'm gonna
drive to the nearest town.

228
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:59,224
You're not going anywhere.

229
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:01,059
- Hey!
- Hey!

230
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,769
What's up, man?

231
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,479
Chris, please.

232
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,316
Joel was in another accident a couple
of months ago and a girl was hurt.

233
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:10,485
He's on probation right now.
If the police find out about it,

234
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:13,488
- he could go to jail.
- They're not gonna find out about it.

235
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,323
Look, man, I'm real sorry about that,

236
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:19,252
but that little boy down
there needs our help now.

237
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:21,880
Joel,

238
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:26,835
just give me the keys, all right?

239
00:26:34,552 --> 00:26:36,928
- You okay?
- Yeah. Go.

240
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,272
He wouldn't stop.

241
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:14,724
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

242
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:46,965
Once upon a time,

243
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:50,594
there was this old man,

244
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:57,225
and he had a very, very special son.

245
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,270
- Daddy.
- Yeah, baby?

246
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,566
- Hey, are you okay?
- Steve! Steve!

247
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:57,953
Hey, Steve, let us out, man!
We're in here!

248
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:01,906
Oh, man. I just don't believe this.

249
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:03,491
I'm not going to jail
for a fucking accident.

250
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:05,285
- Come on, Steve! Damn it!
- Come on!

251
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:08,204
Just look, the kid's father showed up.
He took the kid away.

252
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,789
Now, I think everything's
gonna be okay.

253
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,957
- Really?
- Yeah.

254
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:13,918
- Did you tell him what happened?
- I told him it was an accident.

255
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,213
- And?
- And he just looked at me.

256
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:20,383
- What do you mean, he just looked at you?
- I don't know.

257
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:22,594
Don't lie to me!

258
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:25,397
He looked at me like
he wanted to kill me.

259
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:18,483
Looking for your pa.

260
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:20,109
- Hey! Bunt!
- Sir?

261
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:23,079
- Fetch your grandpa.
- Okay.

262
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:31,746
Grandpa, Pa wants you.
Mr. Harley's outside with the feed.

263
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:35,550
You go on out and unload
the feed. I'll be out directly.

264
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,392
- Here's what I owe you.
- Keep it if you can help me.

265
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:55,320
I'm looking for an old woman.

266
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:58,857
She lives somewhere in
the mountains hereabouts.

267
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:01,484
Some folkses say as
how she's got powers.

268
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:03,903
I never heared of no such woman.

269
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:06,990
Mr. Wallace. Please.

270
00:31:06,991 --> 00:31:10,293
I can't tell you what I don't know.

271
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,341
- Bunt.
- Sir?

272
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:27,886
- Get over by the house.
- But you told me to do this first.

273
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:30,597
You do what I told you,
boy, and you do it now.

274
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:32,440
Okay.

275
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:40,156
- What killed him?
- City folks run him over.

276
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:45,278
- Left him.
- I'm sorry about your boy.

277
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,197
You got to tell me. She's the
only one that can help him.

278
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:52,785
- Like I said, I'm sorry.
- You got to tell me, God damn it!

279
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:57,582
She can't help him. All she can
do is take you straight to hell.

280
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:03,054
Now, you go on home. You go
home and you bury your boy.

281
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,272
Hold it!

282
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:25,869
Mr. Harley, I heard you
talking to my grandpa.

283
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:28,997
I know who you're looking for.

284
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:32,492
- What's your trade?
- What?

285
00:32:32,493 --> 00:32:34,919
Her name's Haggis.

286
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:44,963
She's up on Black Ridge.

287
00:32:44,964 --> 00:32:46,631
Get in back.

288
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:48,600
No way.

289
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,762
You got to show me. Get in back.

290
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:55,982
Okay, but I'm only going part way.

291
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:01,696
That old woman scares
the piss out of me.

292
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:08,411
Stop it! Stop the truck! Stop!

293
00:33:11,115 --> 00:33:14,951
This is as far as I go.
You keep on straight.

294
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:17,161
Follow this road till
you can't no more.

295
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:20,215
You come to a cabin, that's her.

296
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:05,069
Who are you?

297
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:08,981
Ed Harley. I thought...

298
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:14,120
Afraid raising the dead
ain't within my power.

299
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:52,033
This is...

300
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:56,746
This is all I got.
This is everything.

301
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:05,630
Nothing I can do for him.

302
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:10,001
- When I was young...
- I said, there's nothing I can do.

303
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:12,804
- I saw it.
- What?

304
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:17,976
What do you want, Ed Harley?

305
00:36:18,135 --> 00:36:20,144
Say it.

306
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:27,026
Say it! Say it!

307
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,691
When I was young,
folks used to talk about you.

308
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,693
Said as how you knew things.

309
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:39,864
Said if a man had been wronged,
he could come to you

310
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:43,743
and you'd called upon this
thing in that man's name,

311
00:36:43,744 --> 00:36:46,245
and that man, he'd be avenged.

312
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:48,798
What you're asking

313
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:52,969
got a powerful price.

314
00:36:53,754 --> 00:36:56,047
They killed my boy.

315
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:59,809
They run him over and they left him.

316
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:07,525
Ever hear of Razorback Hollow?

317
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:12,146
There's an old graveyard

318
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:15,283
way back deep in them woods.

319
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:21,205
Mountain folk used to bury kin
in there, kin they's ashamed of.

320
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,450
Bring a shovel.

321
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:28,046
The thing you're
looking for is in there.

322
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:31,457
Bring it back here.

323
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:36,763
Some things I got to do to it
before it'll be any use to you.

324
00:37:37,214 --> 00:37:41,434
- That graveyard... How will I know...
- You'll know, Ed Harley.

325
00:37:42,636 --> 00:37:44,812
You'll know.

326
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:53,029
Leave the boy.

327
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:18,424
God.

328
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:21,854
When we get out of here,

329
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:25,566
Joel's gonna be carrying his
balls home in a knapsack.

330
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:28,652
Remind me never to
piss you off, Tracy.

331
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:31,071
I'll tell them it was my fault,

332
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:34,250
that it was my bike that hit him.

333
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:39,005
The worst they're gonna give
me is a slap on the wrist.

334
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:41,048
No.

335
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,727
Look, I'm really starting
to worry about Maggie.

336
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:07,199
Bring it here.

337
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:29,972
- What is it?
- It's what you wanted, Ed Harley.

338
00:42:31,508 --> 00:42:38,472
For each of man's evils,
a special demon exists.

339
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:41,016
You're looking at vengeance,

340
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:47,323
cruel, devious,
pure-as-venom vengeance.

341
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,619
Give me your hand.

342
00:45:17,841 --> 00:45:21,143
You can go now, Ed Harley.

343
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,772
Now it begins.

344
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:54,260
What'd you do, Daddy?

345
00:46:28,745 --> 00:46:33,549
Well, fuck it. Let's just kidnap
Chris and Tracy and go to Mexico.

346
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:37,553
Guys.

347
00:46:39,756 --> 00:46:44,101
You got to do the right thing,
and you got to do it now.

348
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:54,570
They killed our boy, Lynn, honey.
Now they're gonna pay.

349
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:21,013
Maggie.

350
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:27,019
Here. Look.

351
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:29,221
Look, Maggie. Look at it.

352
00:47:29,222 --> 00:47:32,182
You always found your
strength from this.

353
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:34,810
Well, find it now and come back.

354
00:47:34,811 --> 00:47:36,937
I need you.

355
00:47:36,938 --> 00:47:40,065
Steve. Steve.

356
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:41,950
Yeah.

357
00:47:47,824 --> 00:47:50,751
It's okay. I'm sure the
boy's gonna be fine.

358
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:54,004
I'm sure his father's
taking care of everything.

359
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:01,887
Steve! No!

360
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:25,536
Help! Steve! No!

361
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:38,173
I'm always fucking up.

362
00:48:39,626 --> 00:48:42,720
My whole life, one big fuck-up.

363
00:48:43,296 --> 00:48:45,723
But it stops now.

364
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:02,940
- Help me! Help me!
- Maggie!

365
00:49:02,941 --> 00:49:05,659
- Maggie, what happened?
- It's killing him!

366
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:12,416
Lock the door.

367
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:17,296
Steve!

368
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:23,251
If those scum hurt my brother,
I'll rip their fucking hearts out. Steve!

369
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:25,337
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee...

370
00:49:25,338 --> 00:49:28,173
Maggie, whatever you saw
out there, it wasn't the devil.

371
00:49:28,174 --> 00:49:29,424
It was!

372
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:32,728
- There is no such thing.
- There is! I saw it!

373
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:37,983
Oh, man, be okay, Steve. Be okay.
We're gonna find him, man.

374
00:50:05,378 --> 00:50:09,339
They should be okay, right? I mean,
they took the gun and everything.

375
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:13,685
God is the only thing that can
stop what's out there, Kim.

376
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:29,535
Just in case God doesn't show.

377
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:42,381
Oh, God, Steve.

378
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:45,843
Cabin, man! Come on!

379
00:50:56,429 --> 00:50:58,397
Jesus.

380
00:50:58,848 --> 00:51:00,474
- Joel!
- You all right?

381
00:51:00,475 --> 00:51:02,434
- There was something at the window.
- What about Steve?

382
00:51:02,435 --> 00:51:03,602
We couldn't find him.

383
00:51:03,603 --> 00:51:05,479
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

384
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,105
We've got to get
the hell out of here.

385
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:09,357
We're not going
anywhere without Steve.

386
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:12,402
- Maggie, we don't know what's out there.
- Steve is out there.

387
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:14,488
She's right. Now, come on.
We're gonna find him.

388
00:51:14,489 --> 00:51:16,498
Maggie, wait!

389
00:51:32,173 --> 00:51:35,893
- Here, help me!
- Maggie!

390
00:51:40,098 --> 00:51:42,065
Tracy!

391
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:47,145
- Maggie! Maggie!
- God damn it! Tracy! Wait!

392
00:52:17,677 --> 00:52:21,388
- Maggie! Maggie!
- Did you see something?

393
00:52:21,389 --> 00:52:25,150
- I saw something. I don't know what...
- Just stay close, okay?

394
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:16,159
It'll pass, Ed Harley.

395
00:53:16,736 --> 00:53:20,822
- Let it finish.
- No, you got to stop it.

396
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:23,158
It's what you wanted.

397
00:53:23,159 --> 00:53:26,953
No! Not like this! Not like this!

398
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:30,090
I see it. This is wrong.

399
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:32,542
Nothing I can do.

400
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:35,637
It's got to run its course now.

401
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:39,341
What did you think? It'd be easy,

402
00:53:39,342 --> 00:53:42,552
neat and clean and painless?

403
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:45,555
- You're a fool.
- If you won't help me...

404
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:48,183
If you don't help me,
then I'll do it myself.

405
00:53:48,184 --> 00:53:50,602
I'll do it, I'll do it myself.

406
00:53:50,603 --> 00:53:56,024
You'll fail, Ed Harley.
You'll fail and you'll die, too.

407
00:53:56,025 --> 00:53:58,318
Then I'll die. Then I'll die!

408
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:02,906
And pay the final
price all the sooner.

409
00:54:02,907 --> 00:54:05,533
God damn you. God damn you.

410
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:09,171
He already has, son.

411
00:54:10,498 --> 00:54:13,383
He already has.

412
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,888
Maggie!

413
00:54:48,369 --> 00:54:52,255
No! No!

414
00:55:30,328 --> 00:55:32,921
I'm the one you want!

415
00:56:11,994 --> 00:56:14,337
No!

416
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:22,962
No!

417
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:24,806
No!

418
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:29,886
- Oh, my God, Joel. What's wrong?
- It's got Kim.

419
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:31,638
- What's got her?
- It's a thing.

420
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:34,274
- What thing, man?
- It's a thing! I don't know! It's a thing!

421
00:56:37,686 --> 00:56:40,855
- Kim! Kim! Kim!
- Come on, man. Come on, man.

422
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:43,116
Tracy, come on!

423
00:56:43,609 --> 00:56:46,286
Kim! Kim!

424
00:56:47,696 --> 00:56:51,416
- Joel!
- Oh, my God.

425
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:53,410
Kim!

426
00:56:58,457 --> 00:57:01,251
- No.
- No!

427
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:05,555
No!

428
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:13,847
Joel, come on. We got to move, man.

429
00:57:13,848 --> 00:57:15,857
Come on!

430
00:58:41,352 --> 00:58:43,361
Help us!

431
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:46,814
- Hello?
- Why is this happening?

432
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:51,119
- I don't know!
- We got to move. Let's go.

433
00:58:53,614 --> 00:58:56,741
- Help! Somebody help us!
- Help!

434
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:58,618
Help us!

435
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:02,413
Anybody in there, please?
There's something after us.

436
00:59:02,414 --> 00:59:04,341
Please!

437
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:07,585
Where's Steve at?

438
00:59:07,586 --> 00:59:09,128
Please!

439
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:11,348
Don't be mad.

440
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:14,642
- I'm cold.
- Come on.

441
00:59:16,178 --> 00:59:18,229
Steve's dead.

442
00:59:20,975 --> 00:59:22,976
Come on, man.

443
00:59:22,977 --> 00:59:24,769
Come on.

444
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:26,780
Come on.

445
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:35,038
Tracy.

446
00:59:43,706 --> 00:59:46,374
Shit. It's locked.

447
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:49,552
Okay, just get back.

448
00:59:54,008 --> 00:59:56,643
Empty your hands, son.

449
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:03,608
Get away from here.

450
01:00:03,642 --> 01:00:06,403
- Go on. Get.
- Look, mister.

451
01:00:06,979 --> 01:00:12,450
We got something chasing us.
We just want to use your truck, okay?

452
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:15,870
- Please.
- Get off my land.

453
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:18,531
Don't make me have to shoot you.

454
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:22,994
- Please. We just need your help.
- I can't help you.

455
01:00:22,995 --> 01:00:25,163
You folks is marked.

456
01:00:25,164 --> 01:00:28,258
Marked? What do you mean, marked?

457
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:11,759
Joel. Joel, no. No, Joel,
you don't know if it's dead!

458
01:01:19,093 --> 01:01:20,977
It's dead.

459
01:01:42,074 --> 01:01:43,958
Joel!

460
01:02:22,197 --> 01:02:23,573
Come on.

461
01:02:23,574 --> 01:02:24,782
- Come on.
- What is it?

462
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:28,411
I don't know! But whatever it is, it's
not gonna get us. Do you hear me?

463
01:02:28,412 --> 01:02:33,174
It's not gonna get us! There must
be somebody that can help us!

464
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:35,718
Come on!

465
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:54,070
Bunt, get away from that window.

466
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:57,356
Grandpa, you sure that thing
ain't gonna hurt the animals?

467
01:02:57,357 --> 01:03:00,276
It only kills what it was
called upon to kill.

468
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:03,029
Them, and whatever gets in its way.

469
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:04,781
Our animals will be fine.

470
01:03:04,782 --> 01:03:08,751
You get away from that
window, and you get to bed.

471
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:13,915
Help! Help us!

472
01:03:13,916 --> 01:03:16,926
Get to bed like I told you. Now.

473
01:03:17,628 --> 01:03:19,712
For God's sake, please.

474
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:23,057
Help us! Come on, man! Let us in.

475
01:03:28,806 --> 01:03:30,648
Damn.

476
01:03:59,461 --> 01:04:02,213
- Bunt?
- Go back to sleep, Hessie.

477
01:04:02,214 --> 01:04:04,974
- What you doing?
- Nothing.

478
01:04:11,598 --> 01:04:13,441
Okay.

479
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:18,646
If I tell you, you got to promise
not to tell nobody. Not a soul.

480
01:04:18,647 --> 01:04:21,491
- I won't.
- Cross your heart.

481
01:04:22,401 --> 01:04:24,861
- Now swear.
- I swear.

482
01:04:24,862 --> 01:04:26,704
Spit.

483
01:04:30,075 --> 01:04:33,995
I'm gonna help those folks, Hessie. I got
to find out if it's real or just a story.

484
01:04:33,996 --> 01:04:35,955
Grandpa will whip you
good if he finds out.

485
01:04:35,956 --> 01:04:38,758
He ain't gonna find out.

486
01:04:41,587 --> 01:04:43,680
Be careful.

487
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:47,850
Of course I'm gonna be careful.

488
01:05:06,028 --> 01:05:07,829
Hey.

489
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:12,867
Shh.

490
01:05:12,868 --> 01:05:14,794
Come on.

491
01:05:19,124 --> 01:05:21,459
- It's you.
- Did you get a look at it?

492
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:23,711
- What's it look like? Is it big?
- Who are you?

493
01:05:23,712 --> 01:05:28,558
- Man, what's going on?
- I'm trying to help you, for Christ's sake.

494
01:05:29,509 --> 01:05:31,761
My name's Bunt. I live
in this house here.

495
01:05:31,762 --> 01:05:34,430
How come nobody answered
the door? Didn't they hear us?

496
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:37,767
They can hear you.
They ain't allowed to help.

497
01:05:37,768 --> 01:05:39,977
They ain't allowed to let you in.
They can't get involved.

498
01:05:39,978 --> 01:05:43,147
- What do you mean, man?
- A man back there said we were marked.

499
01:05:43,148 --> 01:05:47,902
We can't talk about this here. Come on.
I know a place that might be safe.

500
01:05:47,903 --> 01:05:49,779
Come on.

501
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:55,251
I know where we can go.
Come on. Come on.

502
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:43,758
Ain't it neat?

503
01:06:44,251 --> 01:06:48,921
About 40 years ago, they tried to
start a congregation up around here.

504
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:51,716
Didn't work out, I guess.

505
01:06:51,717 --> 01:06:55,177
I figure it's a holy place,
so it might not like it here.

506
01:06:55,178 --> 01:06:57,146
Come on.

507
01:06:57,973 --> 01:07:00,483
Come on. Watch out.

508
01:07:12,237 --> 01:07:17,166
Bunt. What do you know about
that thing that's after us?

509
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:20,336
It's some kind of demon.

510
01:07:22,414 --> 01:07:23,539
Before tonight I didn't believe it.

511
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:28,627
I thought it was just something that
they made up to scare the little kids.

512
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:33,132
But when the sun went down, my grandpa
fetched the whole family together.

513
01:07:33,133 --> 01:07:36,302
And he told us that some outsider
folks had done something real bad.

514
01:07:36,303 --> 01:07:39,522
He wouldn't say what. He just said

515
01:07:39,848 --> 01:07:43,100
that Pumpkinhead was
gonna be out after them,

516
01:07:43,101 --> 01:07:45,144
and that we better stay
inside till he got them.

517
01:07:45,145 --> 01:07:48,531
- Pumpkinhead?
- That's what it's called,

518
01:07:48,899 --> 01:07:51,567
'cause it comes from the old
pumpkin patch graveyard.

519
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:55,196
- Well, do you know why it's after us?
- No, ma'am.

520
01:07:55,197 --> 01:07:57,531
But you must have done something bad.

521
01:07:57,532 --> 01:08:00,868
See, according to the legend, if one
man does something bad to another man,

522
01:08:00,869 --> 01:08:04,497
it's got to be something real bad,
something like killing...

523
01:08:04,498 --> 01:08:09,010
Then that other man can have Pumpkinhead
conjured up to take revenge.

524
01:08:10,837 --> 01:08:13,089
The kid at the stand.

525
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:16,851
What? What?

526
01:08:17,511 --> 01:08:20,521
There was an accident earlier.

527
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:25,818
One of our friends hit a
little boy with a motorcycle.

528
01:08:26,144 --> 01:08:28,020
Where?

529
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:32,074
At the fruit stand a couple
of miles down the road.

530
01:08:32,109 --> 01:08:34,360
Gosh almighty. Billy Harley.

531
01:08:34,361 --> 01:08:37,330
You know? You heard about it?

532
01:08:40,826 --> 01:08:42,952
I took his...

533
01:08:42,953 --> 01:08:48,591
I saw his pa, Mr. Harley, this afternoon.
I took him somewhere.

534
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:52,094
- Well, was his son okay?
- I can't say for sure.

535
01:08:53,338 --> 01:08:55,548
But if that thing's hunting you,
I suppose not.

536
01:08:55,549 --> 01:08:57,299
Oh, my God.

537
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:01,228
- Your friends, where are they now?
- They're dead.

538
01:09:06,101 --> 01:09:07,685
Do you know the spot
on Bradley Mountain

539
01:09:07,686 --> 01:09:09,603
- where people park their cars?
- Yes.

540
01:09:09,604 --> 01:09:12,198
- Can you take us there?
- Uh-huh.

541
01:09:13,859 --> 01:09:16,535
I think it's here now.

542
01:09:37,174 --> 01:09:38,924
Go!

543
01:09:38,925 --> 01:09:41,102
Go! Move it!

544
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:43,122
Wallace! Wallace! Open up!

545
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:48,753
Wallace, open up! Wallace!

546
01:10:48,787 --> 01:10:51,121
We got to stop it!

547
01:10:51,122 --> 01:10:55,051
We got to stop it, or it's
going to kill them all.

548
01:10:55,794 --> 01:10:59,129
Open up or I'll blow the
goddamn thing off the hinges.

549
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:01,432
Lose it, Harley.

550
01:11:07,389 --> 01:11:11,609
You get away from here.
Get away from me and my kin.

551
01:11:27,951 --> 01:11:29,960
This way.

552
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:43,465
Stay here.

553
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:45,768
- No.
- Stay here.

554
01:12:11,703 --> 01:12:13,629
Chris!

555
01:12:30,472 --> 01:12:32,481
Chris.

556
01:12:39,314 --> 01:12:41,240
Chris.

557
01:12:41,816 --> 01:12:44,201
Come on. Please.

558
01:12:46,071 --> 01:12:47,830
Come on.

559
01:12:54,788 --> 01:12:57,331
Ma'am, you got to get up.
Come on. We got to go.

560
01:12:57,332 --> 01:13:00,459
Please. We can't stop it. No one can.

561
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:02,636
Somebody can.

562
01:13:04,464 --> 01:13:06,757
- Mr. Harley.
- Come with me.

563
01:13:06,758 --> 01:13:08,926
Mr. Harley,
it's Pumpkinhead. It's real.

564
01:13:08,927 --> 01:13:10,686
Now.

565
01:13:11,846 --> 01:13:13,856
Come on.

566
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:23,949
Get in.

567
01:13:54,472 --> 01:13:56,857
Get in the house.

568
01:13:56,933 --> 01:13:58,817
Do you wanna live?

569
01:14:21,499 --> 01:14:23,333
You Okay?

570
01:14:23,334 --> 01:14:25,177
Yeah.

571
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:29,431
Thanks to you.

572
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:36,605
I'm gonna go outside
and talk to Mr. Harley.

573
01:14:37,265 --> 01:14:39,984
I want you to stay here.

574
01:14:41,019 --> 01:14:42,778
Mmm-hmm.

575
01:15:18,223 --> 01:15:20,482
Mr. Harley?

576
01:15:21,392 --> 01:15:23,527
Mr. Harley.

577
01:15:25,271 --> 01:15:27,740
It was an accident.

578
01:15:30,193 --> 01:15:32,286
He's dead.

579
01:15:33,404 --> 01:15:36,790
Nobody saw him until it was too late.

580
01:15:46,668 --> 01:15:51,305
Can't you stop this?
Can't you call it off?

581
01:15:52,799 --> 01:15:55,517
Nothing can call it off.

582
01:15:57,387 --> 01:16:01,732
But I'm gonna send it back to
whatever hell it come from.

583
01:16:30,837 --> 01:16:33,013
You old dog.

584
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:52,825
Mr. Harley?

585
01:17:24,182 --> 01:17:26,516
Mr. Harley, are you okay?

586
01:18:14,482 --> 01:18:16,408
Chris.

587
01:20:40,127 --> 01:20:42,137
Kill me.
