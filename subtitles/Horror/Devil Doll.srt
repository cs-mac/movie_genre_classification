THE DIABIC DOLL

3
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,233
You will never win.

4
00:03:05,025 --> 00:03:06,824
You will always lose.

5
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:27,449
And you sympathize.

6
00:03:50,184 --> 00:03:52,638
Of all the good
news in London...

7
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:55,238
I have to get stuck
with the Great Vorelli.

8
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:56,892
It must be for something.

9
00:03:57,244 --> 00:03:59,045
We'll see.

10
00:04:00,289 --> 00:04:04,189
Did you talk to this Hypnotist?
This... Dr. Heller?

11
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:06,145
I spoke to him earlier.

12
00:04:06,402 --> 00:04:09,642
He said he will find his way to the theater by
himself and that he does not want to see you.

13
00:04:10,537 --> 00:04:13,565
He said he could not stand talking
to a journalist at night...

14
00:04:13,566 --> 00:04:15,566
but will come to the office
tomorrow at 10:30...

15
00:04:15,567 --> 00:04:17,666
to give you your opinion about Mr.
Vorelli.

16
00:04:18,321 --> 00:04:21,585
Quite independent, is not it? He does not
know that we will pay for his services?

17
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:24,398
I do not think money
interests you very much.

18
00:04:24,536 --> 00:04:27,980
These retired specialists do not
care about money, or so they say.

19
00:04:29,596 --> 00:04:32,319
Well, take note so that you will not
forget to be available to Mr. Heller,

20
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,219
Tomorrow at 10:30.

21
00:04:35,265 --> 00:04:37,509
What else?
And the girl who will be willing?

22
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,167
Oh, I'm sorry, Mark, I forgot to tell you.

23
00:04:40,168 --> 00:04:42,668
The one we choose does not want to do this.
You're scared.

24
00:04:42,752 --> 00:04:43,867
Afraid of what?

25
00:04:43,898 --> 00:04:46,654
From Mr. Vorelli.
That things are wrong.

26
00:04:48,898 --> 00:04:50,709
Where can I get another one?

27
00:04:50,852 --> 00:04:52,633
It will be difficult. At this time.

28
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,637
Yes...

29
00:05:14,511 --> 00:05:16,533
Hello, may I speak to Marianne?

30
00:05:24,617 --> 00:05:26,488
Hello. Hello, Marianne?

31
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,484
How are you?

32
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:33,986
Yes. Marianne, would you like
to go to the theater tonight?

33
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:46,009
Ladies and gentlemen, I will suggest to
this man that his life is in danger.

34
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,624
Who can die at any moment.

35
00:05:53,694 --> 00:05:57,352
Mr. Harrison...
Look me in the eye.

36
00:06:03,837 --> 00:06:06,850
Mr. Harrison, you told me that in China...

37
00:06:07,331 --> 00:06:10,238
Once he saw a man run
down the street.

38
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:17,749
I want you to imagine
that he's in his place.

39
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,708
Who is on his knees.

40
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:26,686
On my knees...

41
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:45,435
It is about to be
executed by a soldier,

42
00:06:45,436 --> 00:06:48,336
who will shoot a bullet at the back of his neck.

43
00:06:50,488 --> 00:06:55,207
He's alone. Look up to see
the faces of the crowd.

44
00:06:55,869 --> 00:06:58,177
In a few moments, it will move away.

45
00:06:58,261 --> 00:07:00,976
Leaving him dead on the pavement.

46
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:06,038
You turn around... and see the
soldier standing behind you.

47
00:07:06,628 --> 00:07:11,197
Threatening and cold.
Your weapon is ready to fire.

48
00:07:12,776 --> 00:07:15,086
You have little to die for.

49
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,742
Wait for the sound of the gun.

50
00:07:20,277 --> 00:07:24,332
The pain the bullet will cause you
while piercing his head.

51
00:07:28,186 --> 00:07:30,828
Wait for the sound of the gun.

52
00:07:31,512 --> 00:07:35,726
The tremendous pain that the bullet will cause
while piercing his head.

53
00:08:02,512 --> 00:08:05,543
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I need another volunteer.

54
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:07,450
Someone?

55
00:08:11,662 --> 00:08:13,793
Maybe this young lady in line seven?

56
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:16,954
Someone?

57
00:08:22,154 --> 00:08:23,024
Vá.

58
00:08:23,105 --> 00:08:24,830
Mark, I do not think so.

59
00:08:24,925 --> 00:08:26,690
Come on, you promised me.

60
00:08:26,983 --> 00:08:27,983
It's fine.

61
00:08:49,983 --> 00:08:52,070
Well, it's very easy on your part.

62
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,023
Would you mind telling me your name?

63
00:08:54,986 --> 00:08:57,085
Marianne Horn.

64
00:08:58,286 --> 00:09:00,998
"Are you afraid, Miss Horn?"
- No...

65
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:02,599
I do not think so.

66
00:09:03,306 --> 00:09:06,050
Are you a professional artist?

67
00:09:06,873 --> 00:09:08,158
No, no.

68
00:09:08,203 --> 00:09:11,836
I knew it was not.
She seems to be a very sober young woman.

69
00:09:13,325 --> 00:09:15,912
Let's see, Miss Horn.
You dance?

70
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,011
Everybody Dance.

71
00:09:19,897 --> 00:09:21,291
Ballet?

72
00:09:21,292 --> 00:09:23,692
Do not. Not since I did some
classes when I was a kid.

73
00:09:23,893 --> 00:09:24,893
I understand.

74
00:09:25,057 --> 00:09:28,330
MS. Horn, do not be afraid.

75
00:09:28,657 --> 00:09:31,440
S... look me in the eye.

76
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:55,756
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight we have
a modern dance specialist with us.

77
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:02,040
He will dance with Miss Horn and assure you
that she will dance as well as he does.

78
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:08,410
Miss Horn, at some point you
will begin to listen to music.

79
00:10:08,411 --> 00:10:13,511
When that music starts,
you'll become a dancer.

80
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,244
You are Marianne Horn again.

81
00:12:01,986 --> 00:12:04,345
But a magnificent
dancer was lost.

82
00:12:09,727 --> 00:12:14,681
And now, ladies and gentlemen, I beg you
to pay attention to my next number.

83
00:12:17,448 --> 00:12:19,898
- What happened to you?
- I do not know.

84
00:12:20,383 --> 00:12:23,869
"Where did you learn to dance like that?"
- Mark, I do not know.

85
00:12:27,715 --> 00:12:32,327
And now, ladies and gentlemen, I will
introduce you to my esteemed collaborator:

86
00:12:32,328 --> 00:12:33,328
Hugo.

87
00:12:34,302 --> 00:12:38,609
When you see it, you may think that it is
nothing more than a simple doll of a venturi.

88
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,310
In fact he is, but...

89
00:12:41,693 --> 00:12:44,022
has unexpected talents.

90
00:12:55,545 --> 00:12:58,873
Well, Hugo, what are you going to
do to make the public fun tonight?

91
00:12:58,874 --> 00:13:01,374
Whatever you wish, dear Vorelli.

92
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:05,314
Except for that sort of thing.
- What are you talking about?

93
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:09,030
You just laughed as I spoke.

94
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,751
What's wrong with that?

95
00:13:11,194 --> 00:13:16,145
It is an old trick of the ventures.
Everyone is doing it now. It's beaten.

96
00:13:17,037 --> 00:13:20,349
Perhaps we can show the public
a variation on the subject.

97
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,992
Give me some wine. I want wine.

98
00:13:25,293 --> 00:13:27,900
A doll drinking wine?

99
00:13:27,995 --> 00:13:29,717
Do not be ridiculous.

100
00:13:31,322 --> 00:13:34,786
I want some. Give it to me.
I know what wine is.

101
00:13:34,787 --> 00:13:38,886
I took it once.
Why can not I have wine?

102
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,265
You're a doll, Hugo.

103
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:59,475
What? Was that beaten up?

104
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,924
Look at the audience applauding.

105
00:14:05,944 --> 00:14:08,804
They're not clapping you,
they're clapping me.

106
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,540
Yeah, me. Hugo, the doll.

107
00:14:16,118 --> 00:14:21,620
If it's for you, you should go and
thank the public, should not you?

108
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:25,838
Go to the spotlight and thank.

109
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:29,961
You have to obey me.

110
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:32,458
Hugo...

111
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:38,258
Walk to the spotlight and thank.

112
00:15:04,108 --> 00:15:06,192
Thank you.

113
00:15:10,794 --> 00:15:12,991
Go back to your master.

114
00:15:54,527 --> 00:15:56,573
Do you know who this girl was?

115
00:15:56,648 --> 00:15:58,650
What were you seducing yourself in your head?

116
00:15:58,807 --> 00:16:01,721
MS. Horn. Marianne Horn.

117
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:05,017
One of the richest girls in England.

118
00:16:05,267 --> 00:16:08,480
Your aunt will give a bouncy
ball on Saturday night.

119
00:16:08,673 --> 00:16:13,246
I think I will call her
to offer her my talents.

120
00:16:24,445 --> 00:16:31,442
<i>Marianne, Marianne, come to me...</i>

121
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,558
What did you say?

122
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,168
Anything. Because?

123
00:16:37,722 --> 00:16:40,845
I thought you had said my name.

124
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,175
You must be hearing things.

125
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,402
You know, I must admit that
Vorelli is certainly different.

126
00:16:48,517 --> 00:16:50,714
And the doll is fascinating.

127
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:59,072
He scares me. It really does
seem to have unusual powers.

128
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:02,448
Yeah. The paper had a pretty
good idea about Vorelli.

129
00:17:03,927 --> 00:17:07,129
I still think he's a scam,
but a very good one.

130
00:17:15,846 --> 00:17:18,731
I would like the opportunity
to examine this doll.

131
00:17:19,678 --> 00:17:22,264
And in that, you can help me.

132
00:17:22,895 --> 00:17:28,272
Oh, I can? That's what you think.
I've had enough.

133
00:17:28,273 --> 00:17:30,173
Let's go, please.

134
00:17:30,448 --> 00:17:31,727
What can I do?

135
00:17:32,157 --> 00:17:34,875
Well, your aunt is going to
give her annual bouncy ball.

136
00:17:34,876 --> 00:17:37,776
You could go to the great
Vorelli and invite him.

137
00:17:40,376 --> 00:17:43,630
I know he will. I saw how he looked
at you when he came onstage.

138
00:17:44,876 --> 00:17:47,033
Besides, your aunt will love it.

139
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:50,780
I would have the opportunity
to examine the doll closely.

140
00:17:52,953 --> 00:17:55,192
Because you will invite him
to spend the night.

141
00:17:56,301 --> 00:17:58,383
It's the only way I can do it.

142
00:17:58,874 --> 00:18:02,660
The newspaper clippings on Vorelli do
not explain anything about the doll.

143
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:05,768
No one has ever touched him and
no one knows how he handles it.

144
00:18:06,566 --> 00:18:07,945
What do you say?

145
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:12,297
Well, you know he's very attractive.

146
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:15,098
Maybe I could be
attracted to him.

147
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,824
Well, I'll take the risk.

148
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,505
What do you say?

149
00:18:21,405 --> 00:18:24,808
That's right.
The things I do for you.

150
00:19:20,305 --> 00:19:24,492
Yes it's good.
This Vorelli is too good.

151
00:19:24,794 --> 00:19:26,534
Must have some trick.

152
00:19:26,682 --> 00:19:29,625
This is the work of a
very trained hypnotist.

153
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:33,226
The art of hypnosis has advanced a
lot since the time of the spells.

154
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:35,444
How do you explain that the doll walks?

155
00:19:35,445 --> 00:19:40,469
I think if I examine it, it would prove
to be a perfect mechanical device.

156
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:44,681
But the tension between Vorelli and
the doll was there, everyone felt.

157
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:49,269
Mass hypnotism, Mr. English.
It is as real as individual hypnotism.

158
00:19:49,818 --> 00:19:52,939
What we saw was a dramatic production.

159
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,440
I'm telling you, a succession
of theatrical tricks.

160
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:05,096
<i>Do not forget what I told you.
I do not want any more pictures of me.</i>

161
00:20:06,106 --> 00:20:10,047
<i>If you continue like this, you already know
what will happen. Do not repeat it again.</i>

162
00:20:18,379 --> 00:20:20,653
- You can come in now.
- Thanks.

163
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,887
I'm so glad to see you again, Miss.
Horn.

164
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:36,389
I did not even know you remembered me.

165
00:20:36,857 --> 00:20:40,361
Not on the contrary.
I have not forgotten you.

166
00:20:42,088 --> 00:20:46,117
Thanks. But I came
to ask you a favor.

167
00:20:46,118 --> 00:20:48,118
That you go to your
aunt's benefit.

168
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,445
Yes. But how did you guess?

169
00:20:51,076 --> 00:20:53,595
Very predictable.
It is very simple.

170
00:20:54,512 --> 00:20:58,331
I read in the papers that your aunt
is giving her annual bouncy ball.

171
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:00,077
You're right.

172
00:21:06,804 --> 00:21:08,210
Follow me?

173
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,822
What is?

174
00:21:10,774 --> 00:21:13,694
A Sicilian wine.

175
00:21:14,032 --> 00:21:16,969
A little sweet, but
pretty good at this time.

176
00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:22,616
I always drink.
It's called: Sangre della Virgine.

177
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:25,456
The virgin's blood.

178
00:21:27,293 --> 00:21:30,128
Smell. It has a delicious aroma.

179
00:21:31,327 --> 00:21:35,718
"Is not it too early to drink?"
"But this is a special occasion.

180
00:21:35,971 --> 00:21:37,776
By the bountiful dance.

181
00:21:39,893 --> 00:21:41,951
You mean you will?

182
00:21:41,952 --> 00:21:46,552
- If you want to.
- Oh, I really want it, this is wonderful!

183
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:51,953
I did not expect that I could come in
here and accept my invitation, this way.

184
00:21:54,216 --> 00:21:56,239
But you know it's bouncy.

185
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,540
"Your honor..."
- It will not be anything.

186
00:21:59,511 --> 00:22:02,729
My aunt will be so happy.
I do not know how to thank you.

187
00:22:02,802 --> 00:22:04,630
I will be delighted.

188
00:22:05,403 --> 00:22:08,228
But... he still has not drank his wine.

189
00:22:12,529 --> 00:22:14,126
It is very sweet.

190
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,610
Look at him...

191
00:22:21,263 --> 00:22:23,757
Deep and thick...

192
00:22:24,017 --> 00:22:26,489
red and white...

193
00:22:27,852 --> 00:22:34,404
deep... thick...
red... cold...

194
00:22:40,368 --> 00:22:44,069
"Then will you come?"
"If you ask me."

195
00:22:44,235 --> 00:22:48,017
Thanks. After your presentation
we will send you a car.

196
00:22:59,433 --> 00:23:00,433
Thanks.

197
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,264
I have, thank you.

198
00:23:09,977 --> 00:23:11,197
Thanks.

199
00:23:13,677 --> 00:23:16,305
Aunt Eva, this is your fourth bowl.

200
00:23:16,324 --> 00:23:18,156
- No, honey. My fifth.
- How are you.

201
00:23:26,015 --> 00:23:27,015
Excuse.

202
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:34,625
- Are you having fun, my dear?
- Yes.

203
00:23:35,758 --> 00:23:38,019
- You look beautiful.
- Thanks.

204
00:23:38,131 --> 00:23:39,517
Oh, Mark is coming to.

205
00:23:39,802 --> 00:23:41,110
- Hello.
- Hello.

206
00:23:41,311 --> 00:23:44,515
Mark, you're absolutely wonderful.

207
00:23:44,516 --> 00:23:48,116
You're behaving divinely.
Made us great publicity.

208
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:52,272
I thank you very much.

209
00:23:52,273 --> 00:23:56,073
But I warn you that you must continue
to behave well with Marianne.

210
00:23:56,294 --> 00:23:58,090
She adores you.

211
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,435
Do not worry. I'll do it.

212
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:03,467
Forgiveness. I have to
talk to Lady Hampton.

213
00:24:07,659 --> 00:24:08,738
What's the matter with you?

214
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:11,179
Hey?

215
00:24:11,204 --> 00:24:12,204
Hm?

216
00:24:13,102 --> 00:24:17,106
Oh, nothing.
I was daydreaming, I guess.

217
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:20,927
Mark, I do not like this.

218
00:24:21,012 --> 00:24:22,776
Do not you? Your aunt loves it.

219
00:24:22,806 --> 00:24:24,872
She does not know what she wants to do.

220
00:24:24,931 --> 00:24:27,714
As long as you can raise
funds, what does it matter?

221
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:33,192
It's just that... I do not know.
I wish I had never seen him.

222
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:42,440
Mark, when do I introduce Mr. Vorelli?

223
00:24:42,884 --> 00:24:44,226
You can already submit.

224
00:24:44,227 --> 00:24:45,327
Oh gosh.

225
00:24:49,967 --> 00:24:52,235
Do not worry. Everything will work out.

226
00:24:53,138 --> 00:24:57,235
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a
big surprise for you tonight.

227
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,724
Please, let's get a
little closer here.

228
00:25:01,732 --> 00:25:02,732
Thanks.

229
00:25:02,936 --> 00:25:06,276
I'd like you to
form a semicolon.

230
00:25:07,501 --> 00:25:12,674
I am delighted to introduce
The Great Vorelli and Hugo.

231
00:25:16,899 --> 00:25:19,901
Well, Hugo, I think I
should sing a song.

232
00:25:20,139 --> 00:25:22,179
Do not! I'm tired!

233
00:25:22,603 --> 00:25:24,689
Well, I think you're in a bad mood.

234
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:29,428
I'll leave you alone and when
you're ready to act, act.

235
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:42,706
In the meantime, if you'll excuse
me, I'd like to eat something.

236
00:25:43,111 --> 00:25:45,763
I just got back from the
theater and did not have time.

237
00:25:47,977 --> 00:25:49,733
Oh. Ham.

238
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,261
Really like.

239
00:25:52,507 --> 00:25:54,497
Cannibal!

240
00:25:55,132 --> 00:25:58,778
And what would you eat to
become a cannibal? Sawdust?

241
00:25:58,822 --> 00:26:02,102
Give me something to eat! I'm hungry!

242
00:26:02,947 --> 00:26:06,139
Who ever heard of a
ventriloquist dummy?

243
00:26:06,423 --> 00:26:10,553
I can eat. I can eat like you.

244
00:26:10,554 --> 00:26:13,654
You're not the only one who likes to eat.

245
00:26:14,051 --> 00:26:15,820
Do not be ridiculous.

246
00:26:16,455 --> 00:26:19,985
I'm hungry! I want to eat something!
Now!

247
00:26:20,902 --> 00:26:23,714
Of course you do not expect me to serve you.

248
00:26:32,336 --> 00:26:37,268
Very well. Serve yourself for yourself.

249
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,064
Do not drink too much, Hugo.

250
00:27:07,065 --> 00:27:10,364
The wine will cause the sawdust
of your stomach to swell.

251
00:27:11,259 --> 00:27:16,658
It's a doll, Hugo.
A common puppet.

252
00:27:26,782 --> 00:27:27,782
Hugo!

253
00:27:28,949 --> 00:27:30,957
Let go of that knife!

254
00:27:32,297 --> 00:27:33,762
I said...

255
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,554
drop it

256
00:27:44,817 --> 00:27:50,293
It frightened the ladies.
You have to apologize.

257
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:51,414
Tell them you're sorry.

258
00:27:59,005 --> 00:28:04,732
I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen.

259
00:28:06,481 --> 00:28:08,328
And I...?

260
00:28:12,611 --> 00:28:14,210
I...

261
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:17,607
Yes tell me!

262
00:28:18,051 --> 00:28:23,370
I'm sorry...

263
00:28:23,413 --> 00:28:24,420
Master!

264
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,711
Master.

265
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:45,680
It went up ten minutes ago.
He would have come back.

266
00:28:46,106 --> 00:28:49,681
When he comes down, I'll go upstairs.
I gotta take a look at that doll.

267
00:28:50,949 --> 00:28:53,074
It's impossible...

268
00:28:54,153 --> 00:28:56,224
There has to be somebody inside.

269
00:28:56,479 --> 00:29:01,166
A very small man or maybe a boy.
This is either mechanical.

270
00:29:01,672 --> 00:29:05,034
Honey, it was fascinating, wonderful.

271
00:29:05,048 --> 00:29:06,636
Wonderful.

272
00:29:06,737 --> 00:29:09,237
Have you ever seen anything
so incredible, Mark?

273
00:29:09,283 --> 00:29:10,898
No, never.

274
00:29:10,938 --> 00:29:12,664
There it is.

275
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,802
Excuse.

276
00:29:15,346 --> 00:29:16,982
Congratulations.

277
00:29:19,105 --> 00:29:22,925
- Mr. Vorelli, it was magnific.
- Thank you.

278
00:29:23,174 --> 00:29:27,613
Yours is an incredible doll.
But how do you do it?

279
00:29:27,614 --> 00:29:29,314
It's my mystery, ma'am.

280
00:29:31,131 --> 00:29:34,909
I think I'd like to have a drink, Marianne.
Want to join me?

281
00:29:35,139 --> 00:29:36,364
Thanks.

282
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,615
- It was a great performance.
- Oh yeah.

283
00:30:47,336 --> 00:30:50,608
And when I call you, you will come.

284
00:30:51,318 --> 00:30:55,488
Wherever you are, you will come.

285
00:30:55,543 --> 00:30:59,094
But until I call, you'll be yourself.

286
00:31:00,703 --> 00:31:03,585
The lovely old girl.

287
00:31:06,466 --> 00:31:08,914
And now I'll leave you, my dear.

288
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:15,343
Good evening, beautiful Marianne.

289
00:32:26,271 --> 00:32:28,258
<i>Come with me.</i>

290
00:32:30,054 --> 00:32:34,647
<i>Remember if. He promised to obey me.</i>

291
00:32:34,973 --> 00:32:36,741
<i>You have to obey me.</i>

292
00:32:55,763 --> 00:32:58,832
<i>Come on, Marianne...</i>

293
00:33:01,106 --> 00:33:02,482
<i>Marianne...</i>

294
00:33:03,973 --> 00:33:04,973
<i>Now...</i>

295
00:33:14,505 --> 00:33:16,054
<i>Marianne...</i>

296
00:33:21,571 --> 00:33:23,198
<i>Come to me...</i>

297
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,699
<i>Marianne...</i>

298
00:33:55,958 --> 00:33:59,174
You came, Marianne.
He obeyed me.

299
00:34:00,198 --> 00:34:02,227
But you do not know you're here.

300
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:07,416
You will not remember anything tomorrow.

301
00:34:07,514 --> 00:34:11,708
I will not remember anything.

302
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:21,222
She is very beautiful, my Marianne.

303
00:34:21,532 --> 00:34:23,994
You must learn to respond.

304
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,627
- Is afraid of me?
- Do not.

305
00:34:29,009 --> 00:34:31,471
So why do you resist me?

306
00:34:31,834 --> 00:34:36,884
You're not that strong. My thoughts
have already penetrated your mind.

307
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:43,148
See? I just have to think.

308
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,723
Help me!

309
00:35:41,805 --> 00:35:44,545
Meet me!

310
00:35:45,919 --> 00:35:51,149
In Berlin, 1948.

311
00:35:52,368 --> 00:35:57,538
Find me in Berlin...

312
00:35:57,739 --> 00:35:58,739
Hugo!

313
00:36:37,233 --> 00:36:40,158
- Your breakfast, Mr. English.
- Thank you.

314
00:36:43,221 --> 00:36:45,166
How was the party?

315
00:36:46,178 --> 00:36:49,681
The doll spoke to me last night.
He entered my room.

316
00:36:50,524 --> 00:36:52,731
Did the doll come into your room?

317
00:36:52,732 --> 00:36:53,932
That's it.

318
00:36:54,413 --> 00:36:56,684
And what did he tell you, Mark?

319
00:36:56,913 --> 00:37:00,734
I know it sounds crazy but
you asked for my help.

320
00:37:01,265 --> 00:37:05,054
He told me about Berlin.
Berlin, 1948.

321
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,078
When did you start having those nightmares, Mark?

322
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,086
I'm sure it was not more than that.

323
00:37:11,087 --> 00:37:14,100
It was not a nightmare.
This doll talked to me.

324
00:37:14,269 --> 00:37:16,591
It was all as real as...

325
00:37:16,671 --> 00:37:18,183
You're not serious.

326
00:37:18,353 --> 00:37:19,480
Very serious.

327
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,263
Hello?

328
00:37:23,773 --> 00:37:25,233
For you, Mark.

329
00:37:27,122 --> 00:37:28,972
- Hello?
- Hello, Mark.

330
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:32,149
Mark, Marianne is not doing very well.

331
00:37:32,596 --> 00:37:35,366
The whole house is in a
mess after last night.

332
00:37:35,517 --> 00:37:39,249
I was wondering if
you could come here.

333
00:37:39,317 --> 00:37:40,909
What happened?

334
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:45,954
You know, Mark. The charity, the
preparations, the same party.

335
00:37:46,015 --> 00:37:49,053
She's nervous.
Anyone would stay.

336
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:50,299
But are you okay?

337
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:53,344
Dr. Keisling, the
family doctor, is here.

338
00:37:53,445 --> 00:37:55,145
He would like to have a word with you.

339
00:37:56,631 --> 00:37:59,100
Hello? Mr. English?

340
00:37:59,101 --> 00:38:00,301
Yes, Doctor.

341
00:38:00,682 --> 00:38:04,658
I'm sorry to make you come here, but I
think you'd better come and see Marianne.

342
00:38:04,766 --> 00:38:06,024
What is the problem?

343
00:38:06,126 --> 00:38:09,800
No, nothing serious, but...
I urge you to come.

344
00:38:10,882 --> 00:38:13,544
Right. I'll be there in two hours.

345
00:38:13,578 --> 00:38:17,772
Very well.
It will be a pleasure to meet you. Thank you.

346
00:38:28,677 --> 00:38:30,997
Glad you could come so fast.

347
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,540
Yes...

348
00:38:58,053 --> 00:38:59,053
Yes...

349
00:39:01,729 --> 00:39:04,288
She seems to be in a state of semicom.

350
00:39:04,626 --> 00:39:06,527
With moments of delirium.

351
00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:11,675
Make him stop, Mark...

352
00:39:12,293 --> 00:39:14,444
Marianne, my dear...

353
00:39:21,694 --> 00:39:25,764
Make him stop, Mark...
Make it stop...

354
00:39:25,765 --> 00:39:27,165
Honey, what have you got?

355
00:39:30,503 --> 00:39:32,905
He's calling me, Mark...

356
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:36,621
Please, make him stop...

357
00:39:36,622 --> 00:39:39,122
- Who's calling you?
- Please please...

358
00:39:39,323 --> 00:39:41,723
Please, make him stop...

359
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,767
Let's let her rest.

360
00:39:43,917 --> 00:39:47,052
Maybe if I fall asleep the fever will come down.

361
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:50,480
Please, make him stop...

362
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:15,677
A very strange case.

363
00:40:15,819 --> 00:40:17,251
No, thank you.

364
00:40:17,819 --> 00:40:20,632
I expected her visit to calm her down.

365
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,647
Maybe she's hypnotized...

366
00:40:22,845 --> 00:40:24,463
Think about it.

367
00:40:25,421 --> 00:40:26,618
Vorelli.

368
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:28,846
I do not understand.

369
00:40:29,464 --> 00:40:32,375
Doctor, he was put into trance
by a professional hypnotist.

370
00:40:32,376 --> 00:40:35,276
A man named Vorelli.
The Great Vorelli.

371
00:40:35,927 --> 00:40:41,208
Mr. English, at this time.
Hypnotized. And for what reason? Because?

372
00:40:41,423 --> 00:40:43,591
You said that you yourself do
not understand the symptoms.

373
00:40:43,592 --> 00:40:46,192
You just said it's a
very strange case.

374
00:40:46,976 --> 00:40:50,971
I'll have to study it in depth.
It could be an unknown virus.

375
00:40:51,703 --> 00:40:55,499
You know Dr. Heller?
The expert on hypnosis and mesmerism?

376
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:59,518
Yes. I once attended a
conference at the university.

377
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:01,439
A very interesting man.

378
00:41:01,445 --> 00:41:03,266
I'd like you to see Marianne.

379
00:41:03,889 --> 00:41:06,885
It's clear. If you think it will
do anything, I will not object.

380
00:41:06,886 --> 00:41:09,686
But in the meantime, let's
continue with the tests.

381
00:41:09,714 --> 00:41:11,504
Thank you, Doctor.

382
00:41:12,258 --> 00:41:14,591
You do not believe a
word I say, do you?

383
00:41:15,009 --> 00:41:20,235
Let's say that I keep, as you
Americans say, an open mind.

384
00:41:25,387 --> 00:41:27,526
This, come this way.

385
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:31,217
Thank you.

386
00:41:38,387 --> 00:41:39,635
Ah.

387
00:41:40,436 --> 00:41:42,036
Would you mind telling me your name?

388
00:41:42,906 --> 00:41:44,912
- Miss Penton.
- Miss Penton.

389
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:48,550
And what kind of work
do you do, Miss Penton?

390
00:41:49,449 --> 00:41:51,579
I play the cello in the symphony orchestra.

391
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:52,780
Oh really?

392
00:41:52,981 --> 00:41:55,881
So you must be a
connoisseur of good music.

393
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,632
Yes, I think so.

394
00:41:58,734 --> 00:42:00,858
And what does music do to you?

395
00:42:02,274 --> 00:42:04,853
Well... I feel things.

396
00:42:06,388 --> 00:42:10,181
I suppose different types of music
make you feel different things.

397
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,870
Oh, yes, definitely.

398
00:42:13,059 --> 00:42:14,059
I understand.

399
00:42:14,556 --> 00:42:16,659
Now, Miss Panton, do not be afraid.

400
00:42:17,706 --> 00:42:20,723
Just look into my eyes.

401
00:42:21,464 --> 00:42:23,611
That's it.

402
00:42:29,651 --> 00:42:31,286
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

403
00:42:31,351 --> 00:42:34,584
I will prove to you that we do
not all have secret desires.

404
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:38,026
Desires that go against
what surrounds us.

405
00:42:38,951 --> 00:42:43,125
And how music can actually
get them to surface.

406
00:42:48,789 --> 00:42:52,790
Miss Panton, in some moments you
will be listening to a record.

407
00:42:53,462 --> 00:42:55,334
When you hear music start,

408
00:42:55,835 --> 00:42:57,729
you will become a stripper.

409
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:00,330
And you'll dance for us.

410
00:45:12,104 --> 00:45:13,976
Would you like a cup of coffee, Mark?

411
00:45:14,321 --> 00:45:15,078
Yes.

412
00:45:15,186 --> 00:45:16,403
Yes thanks.

413
00:45:22,391 --> 00:45:24,246
- Hi, Dr. Heller.
- Hello.

414
00:45:27,008 --> 00:45:28,937
Hello, Mr. English.

415
00:45:29,154 --> 00:45:32,111
Hello, Doctor.
Lisa, bring us coffee.

416
00:45:32,432 --> 00:45:33,851
Yes of course.

417
00:45:36,616 --> 00:45:38,422
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

418
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:42,275
- I just saw Miss. Horn.
"And how is it?"

419
00:45:42,302 --> 00:45:47,253
Well... back to being
in a state of semicom.

420
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:50,890
By the way...
I spoke to Vorelli this morning.

421
00:45:51,253 --> 00:45:53,403
He confirmed my theory
that Marianne...

422
00:45:53,404 --> 00:45:55,704
has a subconscious
fear of hypnotism.

423
00:45:57,759 --> 00:45:59,244
It's his fault, is not it?

424
00:45:59,801 --> 00:46:03,307
We can not blame him.
Marianne let herself be hypnotized.

425
00:46:03,629 --> 00:46:05,913
He offered to hypnotize
her again...

426
00:46:05,914 --> 00:46:08,413
and disrupt the control
it exerts on it.

427
00:46:08,478 --> 00:46:12,810
But... it's dangerous, Mark.
Too dangerous.

428
00:46:13,092 --> 00:46:15,449
We have to find another solution.

429
00:46:15,974 --> 00:46:17,237
Yes, but which one?

430
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:20,713
I'm still not sure.

431
00:46:21,477 --> 00:46:23,600
It will take a lot of time.

432
00:46:24,186 --> 00:46:26,030
The mind is very fragile.

433
00:46:26,896 --> 00:46:30,260
We have to be
gentle and patient.

434
00:46:31,911 --> 00:46:33,952
I have to do something.

435
00:46:56,423 --> 00:46:57,677
Hugo...

436
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:02,004
She said you're ugly.

437
00:49:47,457 --> 00:49:49,267
VORELLI KILLER

438
00:50:00,528 --> 00:50:02,233
Good morning, Mr. English.

439
00:50:02,338 --> 00:50:03,916
Finally we got to talk to Mr.
Heller...

440
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:07,417
Forget it. Call Bob Garrett
at his number in Berlin...

441
00:50:07,919 --> 00:50:09,719
Call your hotel.
He will know where he is.

442
00:50:10,905 --> 00:50:13,800
Hi, Mark.
How's your little newspaper?

443
00:50:13,926 --> 00:50:15,663
How is the action in England?

444
00:50:15,847 --> 00:50:18,059
<i>Action? What action?
What are you talking about?</i>

445
00:50:18,251 --> 00:50:21,383
It's women. What was he going to refer to?
The girls.

446
00:50:21,497 --> 00:50:23,677
Forget it. I have a job for you.

447
00:50:23,718 --> 00:50:26,749
One what?
Hey, I have work to spare here.

448
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:28,050
Right now I'm at
the typewriter...

449
00:50:28,051 --> 00:50:30,251
writing an article
on the Berlin Wall.

450
00:50:30,713 --> 00:50:32,417
Write down what I tell you.

451
00:50:32,423 --> 00:50:35,945
Wait a moment.
Sweetheart, give me water and paper.

452
00:50:39,752 --> 00:50:40,752
Thank you.

453
00:50:41,784 --> 00:50:44,025
Right, Mark. Start talking.

454
00:50:44,282 --> 00:50:46,389
A magician, hypnotist.

455
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:48,590
Called The Great Vorelli.
He worked in Berlin.

456
00:50:48,815 --> 00:50:51,980
I want you to investigate everything.
I repeat, all I can about it.

457
00:50:52,335 --> 00:50:54,935
I want you to come back years later. Come back to 1947.

458
00:50:55,454 --> 00:50:57,581
I want to know who he is, where he
came from, and with whom he worked.

459
00:50:58,069 --> 00:51:01,242
<i>Check the archives of the police,
the hospitals and the theaters.</i>

460
00:51:01,243 --> 00:51:02,743
<i>Understood?</i>

461
00:51:03,046 --> 00:51:06,505
Slow down, Mark, slow down.
How do you spell the name?

462
00:51:07,172 --> 00:51:08,914
V-o-r-e-1-i.
Vorelli. Very well.

463
00:51:09,248 --> 00:51:11,226
Now get out of bed
and go to work.

464
00:51:11,348 --> 00:51:15,231
Very good very good. Keep
calm and all that is said.

465
00:51:15,554 --> 00:51:19,001
"Hey, how do you know I'm in bed?"
- I know you, Bob, I know you.

466
00:51:19,315 --> 00:51:22,838
Call me when you have something.
Goodbye, Bobby.

467
00:51:26,493 --> 00:51:27,807
Bye.

468
00:51:30,592 --> 00:51:32,865
"Vorelli's helper
was found dead."

469
00:51:32,866 --> 00:51:36,466
Listen to this: "Miss Kardina was
last seen by Carlos Sandis,"

470
00:51:36,467 --> 00:51:39,067
"the stage manager, at 7:15."

471
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:42,979
"On returning to the theater for the
evening performance, he found her dead."

472
00:51:42,996 --> 00:51:45,100
"Mr. Jack Walton, Theater Director,"

473
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:47,701
"said that Mr. Vorelli
was in his office."

474
00:51:47,817 --> 00:51:51,152
"That you've been talking to a customs
official about your passport..."

475
00:51:51,153 --> 00:51:53,453
"and exit procedures
for travel to Spain."

476
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,213
"The customs officer proved Mr.
Walton's statement."

477
00:51:57,214 --> 00:52:00,700
"They were interrupted by Carlos Sandis,
who had just found the corpse."

478
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:02,301
And here is the best. Listen:

479
00:52:02,683 --> 00:52:07,510
"Mr. Vorelli said, open quotation marks:
That poor girl did not have an enemy. "

480
00:52:07,511 --> 00:52:09,011
"It's a horrible crime."

481
00:52:09,012 --> 00:52:12,812
"I hope the police persevere,
find the killer and justice."

482
00:52:13,151 --> 00:52:15,671
"I'm going to miss her a lot."

483
00:52:16,528 --> 00:52:19,516
The Great Vorelli
with a perfect libah.

484
00:52:20,743 --> 00:52:22,023
Do you know what I think?

485
00:52:22,863 --> 00:52:24,444
That he killed her.

486
00:52:25,514 --> 00:52:27,611
I do not know how, but it was him.

487
00:52:29,734 --> 00:52:32,112
We'll see what Bob investigates in Berlin.

488
00:52:55,286 --> 00:52:57,736
What we have done so far has not helped.

489
00:52:58,102 --> 00:53:01,894
This new American remedy seems
to have a calming effect.

490
00:53:02,013 --> 00:53:03,151
There is something.

491
00:53:03,189 --> 00:53:07,423
Mr. Vorelli called back today.
You seem very worried about Marianne.

492
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:10,011
Yes. He calls regularly.
Very nice.

493
00:53:12,876 --> 00:53:15,598
Doctor, I think you should go up.

494
00:53:15,952 --> 00:53:17,694
Ms. Still delirious.

495
00:53:17,752 --> 00:53:19,598
I feared this.

496
00:53:52,921 --> 00:53:56,235
Another injection, nurse.
Half a pound and a half.

497
00:54:40,148 --> 00:54:42,999
They call you on the phone.
From your office.

498
00:54:45,098 --> 00:54:46,691
How are you?

499
00:55:02,954 --> 00:55:04,584
Hi, Lisa. What is there?

500
00:55:07,289 --> 00:55:09,077
A clue? What does it mean?

501
00:55:11,079 --> 00:55:12,642
Did you say that?

502
00:55:14,673 --> 00:55:16,753
Get me a ticket for the
first flight to Berlin.

503
00:55:16,754 --> 00:55:20,154
Call Bob and tell him to pick me up.
And book a room at the Hilton.

504
00:55:21,403 --> 00:55:23,353
I do not know how long I'll stay there.

505
00:55:26,026 --> 00:55:27,707
<i>Marianne...</i>

506
00:55:29,738 --> 00:55:31,497
<i>Marianne...</i>

507
00:55:33,324 --> 00:55:37,727
<i>Yes, yes, it's coming...</i>

508
00:55:54,865 --> 00:55:57,320
All right, Grace.

509
00:55:58,901 --> 00:56:01,654
Grace, you look very beautiful.

510
00:56:11,296 --> 00:56:13,116
Do you know what your job is?

511
00:56:14,278 --> 00:56:15,458
Yes sir.

512
00:56:15,627 --> 00:56:19,258
Poor Magda.
I will miss her in so many ways.

513
00:56:19,469 --> 00:56:21,562
Tonight, you will stay in her place.

514
00:56:21,659 --> 00:56:22,693
Yes sir.

515
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:25,058
You can go now, Grace.

516
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:28,253
I'll try not to disappoint you, Mr. Vorelli.

517
00:56:28,425 --> 00:56:30,025
I'm sure you will not, dear.

518
00:57:13,643 --> 00:57:15,132
Well, where do we start?

519
00:57:15,251 --> 00:57:18,351
Relax, Mark, relax.
I'll tell you everything.

520
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:22,352
In 1947, Vorelli began
to work in Vaudeville.

521
00:57:22,774 --> 00:57:24,537
But before that he was a doctor.

522
00:57:24,538 --> 00:57:25,538
Doctor?

523
00:57:25,539 --> 00:57:28,539
As it seems to me, after obtaining his
license, he refused to exercise...

524
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:31,040
and became fanatical by
the Eastern mysteries.

525
00:57:31,041 --> 00:57:32,541
He even studied them.

526
00:57:32,996 --> 00:57:33,996
At where?

527
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,290
In Egypt, Huron, Burma.

528
00:57:36,436 --> 00:57:38,713
He has been with the llamas
of Tibet for a full year.

529
00:57:38,714 --> 00:57:41,114
Always studying the same thing.

530
00:57:41,709 --> 00:57:42,709
Hypnosis?

531
00:57:42,946 --> 00:57:44,687
Do not. Not exactly.

532
00:57:44,741 --> 00:57:48,215
What he most believed was that he
could separate a man from his soul.

533
00:57:48,247 --> 00:57:50,195
Difficult to imagine, Mark.

534
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:52,439
And why did you dedicate yourself to Vaudeville?

535
00:57:52,523 --> 00:57:55,690
In December 47 he was expelled
from the Medical Society.

536
00:57:55,706 --> 00:57:57,462
But I could not figure out why.

537
00:57:57,463 --> 00:57:59,462
But the truth is that he was expelled.

538
00:57:59,472 --> 00:58:03,067
The next time someone saw him was
when he started acting in Vaudeville.

539
00:58:03,212 --> 00:58:06,221
He had a number with a boy and a girl.
Hypnotism and all that.

540
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:08,265
He hypnotized them and they did things.

541
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:11,951
One of the numbers that Vorelli did
was stick a dagger in the boy.

542
00:58:11,971 --> 00:58:14,579
Through a friend I was
able to find the woman.

543
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:16,380
It is to her where I am taking you now.

544
00:58:18,472 --> 00:58:22,320
I think it's just the American
police looking for something.

545
00:58:22,359 --> 00:58:24,378
No, we're not cops.

546
00:58:26,222 --> 00:58:28,651
And what do you want?

547
00:58:28,652 --> 00:58:32,252
Know what happened in 48
when you worked with him.

548
00:58:32,479 --> 00:58:34,159
An accident happened, did not it?

549
00:58:35,425 --> 00:58:36,425
Yes.

550
00:58:37,452 --> 00:58:40,299
He did not hear me.

551
00:58:41,319 --> 00:58:44,156
His companion, a boy,
was part of the number.

552
00:58:44,224 --> 00:58:47,315
Oh yeah. Hugo.

553
00:58:48,868 --> 00:58:49,868
Hugo?

554
00:58:50,178 --> 00:58:51,422
Tell us about it.

555
00:58:52,137 --> 00:58:54,569
Would be better...

556
00:58:55,022 --> 00:58:57,054
cut Vorelli's throat.

557
00:59:00,301 --> 00:59:02,216
It's been a long time.

558
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:05,152
I was too young.

559
00:59:06,965 --> 00:59:09,240
Vorelli hired Hugo and me.

560
00:59:09,418 --> 00:59:13,718
We made a number.
We were a couple of dancers.

561
00:59:14,305 --> 00:59:17,547
We won little money
but we were happy.

562
00:59:19,529 --> 00:59:22,633
Vorelli said we'd win more.
Right.

563
00:59:22,861 --> 00:59:23,861
Continues.

564
00:59:25,012 --> 00:59:27,378
Vorelli hypnotized us.

565
00:59:27,973 --> 00:59:29,842
It made us do things.

566
00:59:30,212 --> 00:59:34,520
But off the stage we
were not ourselves.

567
00:59:35,498 --> 00:59:38,961
Then Hugo changed.

568
00:59:39,738 --> 00:59:42,368
Vorelli became his master.

569
00:59:43,155 --> 00:59:47,267
And then... I brought that doll.

570
01:00:14,147 --> 01:00:17,802
Oh, he looks like Hugo!

571
01:00:19,841 --> 01:00:22,263
Yes, he could look like me.

572
01:00:33,535 --> 01:00:37,420
It will look like... It will look like...

573
01:01:21,022 --> 01:01:22,357
Out of here!

574
01:01:22,751 --> 01:01:25,680
And do not come back until I call you!

575
01:01:27,153 --> 01:01:29,341
You will not believe it.

576
01:01:29,422 --> 01:01:32,992
The police did not want
to believe me, but I did.

577
01:01:36,139 --> 01:01:40,757
One night when I went
into the dressing room.

578
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:44,501
I saw the rehearsal.

579
01:01:46,029 --> 01:01:52,526
It was as if...
he would take Hugo's soul...

580
01:01:53,045 --> 01:01:56,509
giving it to the doll.

581
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,394
I tell you what I saw!

582
01:02:01,392 --> 01:02:02,858
I believe you, Mercedes.

583
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:04,998
So you're the first.

584
01:02:05,028 --> 01:02:07,453
And I'm not the only one who knows.

585
01:02:07,543 --> 01:02:09,316
There is another who knows.

586
01:02:11,058 --> 01:02:12,569
Tell me what happened next.

587
01:02:12,802 --> 01:02:16,616
He said.
Vorelli hypnotized us.

588
01:02:17,395 --> 01:02:20,915
It made me do ridiculous things.

589
01:02:21,056 --> 01:02:24,288
And he and Hugo did incredible things.

590
01:02:24,645 --> 01:02:27,942
He thrust a dagger
into his chest.

591
01:02:28,941 --> 01:02:31,834
So, one night...

592
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:38,868
This time, Hugo, you're going to die!

593
01:03:03,003 --> 01:03:05,050
He is my slave.

594
01:03:05,714 --> 01:03:08,464
You will not feel anything.

595
01:03:09,336 --> 01:03:13,050
This is the power of hypnotism.

596
01:03:16,547 --> 01:03:17,742
Watch.

597
01:04:02,865 --> 01:04:07,837
Vorelli had done the same thing many
times and Hugo had not felt anything.

598
01:04:07,954 --> 01:04:12,260
But that time Hugo felt
the blood coming out!

599
01:04:13,970 --> 01:04:15,632
It's hard to believe.

600
01:04:17,629 --> 01:04:18,946
Nobody believes.

601
01:04:20,943 --> 01:04:24,491
Neither the police nor anyone.

602
01:04:29,094 --> 01:04:31,249
Hans, come here.

603
01:04:34,273 --> 01:04:36,746
Maybe you believe in Hans's version.

604
01:04:41,473 --> 01:04:43,132
Did you call me, Mercedes?

605
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:46,670
Hans. Here he is.
He will tell you.

606
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:51,699
These gentlemen are journalists.
They want to know something about Vorelli.

607
01:04:52,069 --> 01:04:56,216
Say it. In front.
Tell them about the doll.

608
01:04:57,571 --> 01:04:59,771
Well, I can not say much.

609
01:05:00,274 --> 01:05:02,135
I was the janitor at the time.

610
01:05:02,439 --> 01:05:04,965
It was not even on the
stage when it happened.

611
01:05:05,243 --> 01:05:07,177
It was in Vorelli's room.

612
01:05:07,744 --> 01:05:10,190
Enjoying that he was away,
he cleaned the room.

613
01:05:10,815 --> 01:05:14,040
I did not see anything... but I heard.

614
01:05:14,545 --> 01:05:17,764
I heard the dagger thrust
into Hugo's chest.

615
01:05:23,071 --> 01:05:24,814
And I saw the doll...

616
01:05:26,184 --> 01:05:31,161
The police came soon. Confusion.
The interrogation.

617
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,578
Witnessed in court?

618
01:05:35,058 --> 01:05:39,522
They asked questions. I answered,
they laughed, they called me crazy.

619
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:41,757
What was the verdict?

620
01:05:42,102 --> 01:05:44,617
Vorelli took the risk.

621
01:05:44,694 --> 01:05:46,230
"Accident".

622
01:05:47,091 --> 01:05:51,588
Hugo died three months after the...
"accident".

623
01:05:52,483 --> 01:05:54,833
In the hospital, in bed.

624
01:05:55,107 --> 01:05:59,814
He did not move for three months.
He was lying on the bed.

625
01:06:00,615 --> 01:06:02,015
Looking at the ceiling.

626
01:06:03,177 --> 01:06:06,026
And then he died.

627
01:06:07,269 --> 01:06:08,828
Died.

628
01:06:10,881 --> 01:06:13,809
Gentlemen, we do not want to drive them
out, but we have to take care of business.

629
01:06:13,811 --> 01:06:16,112
Customers are waiting, you know.

630
01:06:16,187 --> 01:06:19,285
If it's over, I'd be grateful if
you could give us 100 marks...

631
01:06:19,286 --> 01:06:22,786
information.
We've lost more than that in time.

632
01:06:23,081 --> 01:06:24,081
It's fine.

633
01:06:24,206 --> 01:06:27,028
Bobby, can you take
me to the airport?

634
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:32,032
At first I thought it
was a mechanical doll.

635
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:35,331
Or until there was a person
alive inside the doll.

636
01:06:36,691 --> 01:06:38,867
I even went into his room
and examined the doll.

637
01:06:38,868 --> 01:06:41,068
It was nothing more than a wooden doll.

638
01:06:46,683 --> 01:06:48,902
I've never told you this before, Doctor.

639
01:06:48,953 --> 01:06:53,381
The night I examined the doll, he
came to my room and talked to me.

640
01:06:54,204 --> 01:06:57,110
"You were dreaming."
- I knew you'd say that.

641
01:06:57,134 --> 01:06:58,966
I thought it was a dream, too.

642
01:06:59,267 --> 01:07:02,255
But what this doll told me
took me to Mercedes in Berlin.

643
01:07:03,928 --> 01:07:05,603
I know you're thinking
that I'm crazy,

644
01:07:05,604 --> 01:07:08,604
but somehow, he put the
life of a man in that doll.

645
01:07:08,644 --> 01:07:10,917
You have a tremendous imagination.

646
01:07:11,212 --> 01:07:13,146
But I do not like it, Doctor.

647
01:07:13,234 --> 01:07:17,112
Marianne is in bed.
Much like Hugo Novik.

648
01:07:17,425 --> 01:07:19,515
For three months he lay
immobile in a bed.

649
01:07:19,525 --> 01:07:21,823
You are exaggerating the problem.

650
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:24,620
The case of Hugo Novik was catalepsy.

651
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:27,288
- Catalepsy?
- Yes, no life.

652
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:30,661
A perfect case of traumatic shock.

653
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:33,782
This explains the case of the dagger.

654
01:07:34,777 --> 01:07:37,990
Instead of saying that it would not hurt,
he probably said he was going to die.

655
01:07:38,569 --> 01:07:39,941
Or almost.

656
01:07:45,975 --> 01:07:48,278
For three months, Hugo lay in
a hospital without moving...

657
01:07:48,279 --> 01:07:50,879
while Vorelli completed
his transfer.

658
01:07:51,339 --> 01:07:54,492
He put his spy inside that
doll before Hugo died.

659
01:07:54,687 --> 01:07:59,520
And over the years, Hugo Novik's
soul has been inside the doll.

660
01:07:59,704 --> 01:08:01,672
It's crazy.

661
01:08:03,036 --> 01:08:06,281
Besides, Marianne did not
suffer a traumatic shock.

662
01:08:06,687 --> 01:08:08,426
Or maybe yes, I do not know.

663
01:08:08,931 --> 01:08:10,781
The night Vorelli showed
up at his aunt's house,

664
01:08:10,782 --> 01:08:12,481
something happened in your room.

665
01:08:12,593 --> 01:08:14,497
The next day, she was
helpless in bed.

666
01:08:14,794 --> 01:08:17,487
Either way, Hugo Novik's took
place fifteen years ago.

667
01:08:17,574 --> 01:08:19,644
His power may have
increased since then.

668
01:08:19,682 --> 01:08:21,692
You're wasting your time, Mark.

669
01:08:21,705 --> 01:08:24,014
I tell you he stole
this man's soul.

670
01:08:24,097 --> 01:08:26,844
I do not know how and I can not give
you a scientific explanation...

671
01:08:26,845 --> 01:08:28,745
but I know that's what happened.

672
01:08:29,036 --> 01:08:33,889
Mark, do you really believe we should
seriously discuss this matter?

673
01:08:34,355 --> 01:08:37,836
A soul transferred by a
Vaudeville magician.

674
01:08:38,098 --> 01:08:42,307
Vorelli is not a simple Vaudeville magician.
Look at Marianne.

675
01:08:43,735 --> 01:08:46,505
She is a very nervous young woman.

676
01:08:46,675 --> 01:08:49,893
Her case is a case of
interrupted hypnosis.

677
01:08:49,987 --> 01:08:53,103
"That I can understand.
- Very well. What do you suggest?

678
01:08:53,598 --> 01:08:56,682
Forget all this madness.
Forget about Vorelli.

679
01:08:57,319 --> 01:08:59,344
You're tired, nervous.

680
01:08:59,604 --> 01:09:02,065
Maybe even a little jealous.

681
01:09:03,112 --> 01:09:04,903
Are you convinced of that?

682
01:09:04,995 --> 01:09:07,246
You have my word.

683
01:09:07,586 --> 01:09:09,317
I wish I could believe you.

684
01:09:12,738 --> 01:09:14,049
Doctor Heller.

685
01:09:14,618 --> 01:09:16,756
Oh, yes, Dr. Keisling.

686
01:09:17,398 --> 01:09:18,644
Yes...

687
01:09:19,692 --> 01:09:21,396
Oh good.

688
01:09:21,926 --> 01:09:26,674
Marianne is awake and
perfectly normal.

689
01:09:27,525 --> 01:09:29,928
Yes, yes, of course. I'll come this afternoon.

690
01:09:30,485 --> 01:09:31,485
Good.

691
01:09:31,696 --> 01:09:33,396
Thank you, Doctor. Bye.

692
01:09:36,316 --> 01:09:38,006
Thank God.

693
01:09:38,269 --> 01:09:44,141
Mark, take my advice. Forget
Vorelli, forget the doll.

694
01:09:44,790 --> 01:09:46,783
Marianne is much better.

695
01:09:46,896 --> 01:09:49,451
Vorelli is not the villain what you imagine.

696
01:10:21,778 --> 01:10:23,954
Maybe you should not stay too long.

697
01:10:24,659 --> 01:10:27,588
Yes sir. It's clear. I understand.

698
01:11:02,321 --> 01:11:06,404
You'll tell your uncles that you love me.

699
01:11:06,948 --> 01:11:10,517
I love you. I love you.

700
01:11:10,587 --> 01:11:15,286
And you'll tell Mark
he'll marry me.

701
01:11:16,234 --> 01:11:18,622
I'm going to marry you.

702
01:11:18,866 --> 01:11:21,054
Now I have to go.

703
01:11:21,066 --> 01:11:24,977
But when I call you, you will come.

704
01:11:25,419 --> 01:11:27,017
Remember if.

705
01:11:27,494 --> 01:11:32,298
When I call you, you will come, Marianne.

706
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:37,976
- Hello.
- Hello. How are you?

707
01:12:37,977 --> 01:12:39,477
It's good to see you.

708
01:12:39,535 --> 01:12:41,406
- You're much better.
- Thanks.

709
01:12:41,407 --> 01:12:43,107
Dr. took the pills.

710
01:12:44,288 --> 01:12:47,512
Mark, I have to tell you something.

711
01:12:50,076 --> 01:12:54,411
I'm staying with Vorelli.
I'm in love with him.

712
01:12:54,963 --> 01:12:56,003
Is what?

713
01:12:56,295 --> 01:12:57,877
I'm in love.

714
01:13:00,670 --> 01:13:02,404
Sorry, Mark.

715
01:13:02,981 --> 01:13:04,677
How can I explain?

716
01:13:04,869 --> 01:13:07,010
It happened the night you slept here.

717
01:13:09,481 --> 01:13:11,990
I do not know. I do not know what to say.

718
01:13:12,673 --> 01:13:13,833
Forgiveness.

719
01:14:18,377 --> 01:14:23,054
Well, Hugo.
Tonight we will fly to Spain.

720
01:14:23,644 --> 01:14:28,931
And the rich and beautiful Miss
Marianne Horn will become my wife.

721
01:14:29,850 --> 01:14:32,250
What a delicious idea.

722
01:14:33,324 --> 01:14:36,405
Tonight will be our last performance.

723
01:14:36,937 --> 01:14:38,794
All four.

724
01:14:38,835 --> 01:14:44,121
You, Hugo, my beautiful fiancee,
my ugly wooden doll and me.

725
01:14:46,738 --> 01:14:51,952
And then, after a few months, the
transformation will be complete.

726
01:14:52,232 --> 01:14:57,677
My beautiful wife will die,
leaving me all her money...

727
01:14:57,678 --> 01:15:02,178
and for you, a small,
ugly wooden companion.

728
01:15:04,186 --> 01:15:07,860
Of course...
You're ugly too, are not you?

729
01:15:18,233 --> 01:15:19,807
Serve me another.

730
01:15:47,052 --> 01:15:48,547
<i>How stupid I am.</i>

731
01:15:50,287 --> 01:15:54,872
<i>I made a lot of unnecessary spending
on an article about a phony.</i>

732
01:15:55,142 --> 01:15:57,093
<i>A third-class impostor.</i>

733
01:15:57,817 --> 01:16:01,971
<i>The only woman that I cared about
in life falls in love with him.</i>

734
01:16:02,566 --> 01:16:06,351
<i>If you do not fire me after this fiasco,
it's because you're as crazy as I am.</i>

735
01:16:13,706 --> 01:16:16,863
Sleep, my Marianne.

736
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:21,102
Sleep deeply.

737
01:16:46,951 --> 01:16:50,570
I'll wake up my beautiful Marianne
after tonight's performance.

738
01:16:51,354 --> 01:16:55,980
Hugo, today will be our last presentation.

739
01:16:56,679 --> 01:16:59,923
You've lost control too often.

740
01:17:04,531 --> 01:17:06,527
There's so much time in
his little wooden body...

741
01:17:06,528 --> 01:17:08,928
who is becoming a person again.

742
01:17:14,295 --> 01:17:17,033
I think I should give you a little lesson.

743
01:17:39,658 --> 01:17:43,828
Oh, dear Grace.
I'm very busy.

744
01:17:43,829 --> 01:17:44,929
I thought you needed me.

745
01:17:45,933 --> 01:17:47,468
Not now, my dear.

746
01:17:47,860 --> 01:17:51,105
I have to get things right
with the director before I go.

747
01:17:51,813 --> 01:17:53,108
I'll go to your room...

748
01:17:53,109 --> 01:17:55,109
- Very well.
"When you're through with him."

749
01:18:03,457 --> 01:18:07,659
Hugo... I am your master.

750
01:18:08,722 --> 01:18:12,314
Go back to your cage or I'll destroy you.

751
01:20:01,410 --> 01:20:03,647
Do not be alarmed, Mr. English.

752
01:20:03,823 --> 01:20:06,517
Vorelli is now
on the wooden dummy.

753
01:20:08,242 --> 01:20:10,846
I am peaceful, Master.

754
01:20:11,013 --> 01:20:14,152
The situation is reversed.

755
01:20:14,728 --> 01:20:19,357
Do not be afraid of Marianne.
He's sleeping soundly.

756
01:20:19,702 --> 01:20:23,618
When you wake up it will
be the same as before.

757
01:20:26,306 --> 01:20:31,046
Mr. English, get me out of here.
I am the Great Vorelli.

758
01:20:31,363 --> 01:20:34,365
You can not do this to me.

759
01:20:34,366 --> 01:20:37,666
Please, Mr. English.
Do not let him do that.

760
01:20:37,919 --> 01:20:41,040
I'll do anything you want.
Take me out of here.

761
01:20:41,103 --> 01:20:47,913
I'll do anything you want. Please.
I am The Great Vorelli.

762
01:20:50,514 --> 01:20:52,514
END

763
01:20:52,515 --> 01:21:00,515
