1
00:02:47,881 --> 00:02:49,790
Did you hear that?

2
00:02:49,924 --> 00:02:51,548
They shut down the main reactor.

3
00:02:51,675 --> 00:02:53,195
We'll be destroyed for sure.

4
00:02:53,322 --> 00:02:54,235
This is madness.

5
00:03:04,539 --> 00:03:05,737
We're doomed.

6
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:12,932
There'll be no escape
for the princess this time.

7
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,979
What's that?

8
00:04:57,604 --> 00:05:00,011
R2-D2, where are you?

9
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:17,198
At last!

10
00:05:17,328 --> 00:05:19,071
Where have you been?

11
00:05:19,204 --> 00:05:20,366
They're heading in this direction.

12
00:05:20,497 --> 00:05:22,288
What are we going to do?

13
00:05:22,415 --> 00:05:24,158
We'll be sent to
the spice mines of Kessel...

14
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,749
smashed into who knows what!

15
00:05:27,044 --> 00:05:29,830
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?

16
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,633
<i>The Death Star plans
are not in the main computer.</i>

17
00:05:44,765 --> 00:05:47,386
Where are those transmissions
you intercepted?

18
00:05:47,517 --> 00:05:50,303
What have you done with those plans?

19
00:05:50,436 --> 00:05:53,270
We intercepted no transmissions.

20
00:05:53,397 --> 00:05:55,140
This is a consular ship.

21
00:05:55,273 --> 00:05:57,349
We're on a diplomatic mission.

22
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:59,689
If this is a consular ship...

23
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:02,025
where is the ambassador?

24
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,899
Commander, tear this ship apart
until you've found those plans...

25
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:12,034
and bring me the passengers!
I want them alive!

26
00:06:24,587 --> 00:06:26,129
There's one. Set for stun.

27
00:06:31,634 --> 00:06:33,460
She'll be all right.

28
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:35,467
Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

29
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:38,715
Hey! You're not permitted in there.
It's restricted.

30
00:06:38,848 --> 00:06:41,599
You'll be deactivated for sure.

31
00:06:43,602 --> 00:06:44,930
Don't you call me
a mindless philosopher...

32
00:06:45,061 --> 00:06:46,175
you overweight glob of grease!

33
00:06:46,312 --> 00:06:47,936
Now come out before
somebody sees you.

34
00:06:50,357 --> 00:06:52,183
Secret mission?
What plans?

35
00:06:52,317 --> 00:06:53,597
What are you talking about?

36
00:06:53,735 --> 00:06:55,193
I'm not getting in there.

37
00:06:57,946 --> 00:06:59,819
I'm going to regret this.

38
00:07:07,287 --> 00:07:08,662
There goes another one.

39
00:07:08,788 --> 00:07:10,910
Hold your fire.
There's no life forms.

40
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,699
It must have short-circuited.

41
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:17,161
That's funny. The damage
doesn't look as bad from out here.

42
00:07:17,294 --> 00:07:19,167
Are you sure this thing is safe?

43
00:07:21,297 --> 00:07:22,376
Oh.

44
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,892
Darth Vader.
Only you could be so bold.

45
00:07:42,021 --> 00:07:44,346
The Imperial Senate will
not sit still for this.

46
00:07:44,482 --> 00:07:45,596
When they hear you've
attacked a diplomatic...

47
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:47,191
Don't act so surprised,
Your Highness.

48
00:07:47,317 --> 00:07:49,772
You weren't on any
mercy mission this time.

49
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:53,981
Several transmissions were
beamed to this ship by rebel spies.

50
00:07:54,114 --> 00:07:56,948
I want to know what happened
to the plans they sent you.

51
00:07:57,075 --> 00:07:58,783
I don't know what
you're talking about.

52
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:00,617
I'm a member of the Imperial Senate...

53
00:08:00,744 --> 00:08:02,154
on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.

54
00:08:02,287 --> 00:08:05,121
You are part of the Rebel Alliance
and a traitor.

55
00:08:05,247 --> 00:08:06,824
Take her away!

56
00:08:10,877 --> 00:08:12,537
Holding her is dangerous.

57
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,212
If word of this gets out...

58
00:08:14,338 --> 00:08:16,129
it could generate sympathy
for the rebellion in the senate.

59
00:08:16,256 --> 00:08:18,829
I've traced the rebel spies to her.

60
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:21,635
Now she is my only link
to finding their secret base.

61
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,132
She'll die before
she'll tell you anything.

62
00:08:24,262 --> 00:08:25,542
Leave that to me.

63
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,257
Send a distress signal...

64
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:29,630
and then inform the senate
that all aboard were killed.

65
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:31,141
Lord Vader,
the battle station plans...

66
00:08:31,267 --> 00:08:32,429
are not aboard this ship...

67
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,970
and no transmissions were made.

68
00:08:34,103 --> 00:08:36,593
An escape pod was jettisoned
during the fighting...

69
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,272
but no life forms were aboard.

70
00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:41,149
She must have hidden
the plans in the escape pod.

71
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:45,023
Send a detachment down to retrieve
them... See to it personally, Commander.

72
00:08:45,153 --> 00:08:47,643
There'll be no one
to stop us this time.

73
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,859
Yes, sir.

74
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,124
How did we get into this mess?

75
00:09:05,252 --> 00:09:07,921
I really don't know how.

76
00:09:08,045 --> 00:09:09,622
We seem to be made to suffer.

77
00:09:09,755 --> 00:09:11,083
It's our lot in life.

78
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:16,501
I've got to rest before I fall apart.

79
00:09:16,635 --> 00:09:18,592
My joints are almost frozen.

80
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:27,137
What a desolate place this is!

81
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,140
Where do you think you're going?

82
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:34,933
Well, I'm not going that way.

83
00:09:35,066 --> 00:09:36,643
It's much too rocky.

84
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,602
This way is much easier.

85
00:09:38,735 --> 00:09:40,644
What makes you think...

86
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:42,652
there are settlements over there?

87
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,698
Don't get technical with me.

88
00:09:45,824 --> 00:09:49,073
What mission?
What are you talking about?

89
00:09:50,995 --> 00:09:53,532
I've just about had enough of you.

90
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,038
Go that way.

91
00:09:55,165 --> 00:09:57,038
You'll be malfunctioning within a day...

92
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,743
you nearsighted scrap pile.

93
00:09:58,876 --> 00:10:01,201
And don't let me catch you
following me begging for help...

94
00:10:01,336 --> 00:10:02,794
because you won't get it.

95
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:18,549
No more adventures.

96
00:10:18,683 --> 00:10:20,640
I'm not going that way.

97
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,710
That malfunctioning little twerp.

98
00:10:55,836 --> 00:10:57,912
This is all his fault.

99
00:10:58,046 --> 00:11:00,715
He tricked me into going this way...

100
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,713
but he'll do no better.

101
00:11:06,469 --> 00:11:08,093
Wait! What's that?

102
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,595
A transport.

103
00:11:09,721 --> 00:11:11,381
I'm saved!

104
00:11:11,514 --> 00:11:13,222
Over here!

105
00:11:13,349 --> 00:11:14,380
Hey!

106
00:11:14,517 --> 00:11:16,177
Hey!

107
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:19,809
Help! Please help!

108
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:50,884
R2?

109
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,927
R2-D2, it is you! It is you!

110
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,410
Someone was in the pod.

111
00:15:33,548 --> 00:15:36,217
The tracks go off in this direction.

112
00:15:36,341 --> 00:15:38,250
Look, sir, droids.

113
00:15:52,896 --> 00:15:54,473
We stopped.

114
00:15:54,605 --> 00:15:56,265
Wake up! Wake up!

115
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:04,192
We're doomed.

116
00:16:12,035 --> 00:16:14,111
Do you think they'll melt us down?

117
00:16:28,006 --> 00:16:29,879
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

118
00:16:30,007 --> 00:16:31,631
Will this never end?

119
00:17:12,581 --> 00:17:13,956
All right, fine. Let's go.

120
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,205
Luke! Luke!

121
00:17:19,587 --> 00:17:22,753
Luke, tell Uncle
if he gets a translator...

122
00:17:22,881 --> 00:17:24,624
be sure it speaks Bocce.

123
00:17:24,757 --> 00:17:27,247
Doesn't look like we have much
of a choice, but I'll remind him.

124
00:17:37,142 --> 00:17:39,763
Yeah, we'll take that red one.

125
00:17:39,894 --> 00:17:41,933
No, not that one.

126
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:47,346
I suppose you're programmed
for etiquette and protocol.

127
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,858
Protocol? Why, it's
my primary function, sir.

128
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,439
I am well-versed in all the customs...

129
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:53,193
I have no need for a protocol droid.

130
00:17:53,321 --> 00:17:54,863
Of course you haven't, sir.

131
00:17:54,989 --> 00:17:56,187
Not in an environment such as this.

132
00:17:56,323 --> 00:17:57,603
That is why I have
been programmed...

133
00:17:57,741 --> 00:17:59,863
What I really need is
a droid who understands...

134
00:17:59,993 --> 00:18:01,866
the binary language
of moisture vaporators.

135
00:18:01,994 --> 00:18:05,279
Vaporators? Sir, my first job
was programming binary load lifters...

136
00:18:05,413 --> 00:18:06,080
very similar to your vaporators
in most respects.

137
00:18:06,117 --> 00:18:06,661
very similar to your vaporators
in most respects.

138
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:08,413
Can you speak Bocce?

139
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:11,078
Of course I can, sir.
It's like a second language to me...

140
00:18:11,209 --> 00:18:12,489
Yeah, all right. Shut up.
I'll take this one.

141
00:18:12,627 --> 00:18:13,907
Luke!

142
00:18:16,505 --> 00:18:18,581
Take these two over
to the garage, will you?

143
00:18:18,715 --> 00:18:19,877
I want them cleaned up before dinner.

144
00:18:20,008 --> 00:18:21,039
But I was going into Tosche Station...

145
00:18:21,175 --> 00:18:22,550
to pick up some power converters.

146
00:18:22,676 --> 00:18:24,134
You can waste time
with your friends...

147
00:18:24,261 --> 00:18:25,719
when your chores are done.

148
00:18:25,846 --> 00:18:27,803
Now come on. Get to it.

149
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:30,052
All right. Come on.

150
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:34,801
And the red one. Come on.

151
00:18:36,103 --> 00:18:38,510
Well, come on, red. Let's go.

152
00:18:56,953 --> 00:18:57,984
Uncle Owen!

153
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,495
Yeah?

154
00:18:59,621 --> 00:19:02,325
This R2 unit has
a bad motivator. Look.

155
00:19:02,457 --> 00:19:04,829
Hey, what are you
trying to push on us?

156
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,787
Excuse me, sir...

157
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,371
but that R2 unit is in prime condition,
a real bargain.

158
00:19:12,506 --> 00:19:14,794
Uncle Owen, what about that one?

159
00:19:14,925 --> 00:19:16,253
What about that blue one?

160
00:19:16,384 --> 00:19:18,709
We'll take that one.

161
00:19:18,844 --> 00:19:20,042
Take this away.

162
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:21,507
You'll be very pleased
with that one, sir.

163
00:19:21,638 --> 00:19:23,429
He really is in first-class condition.

164
00:19:23,556 --> 00:19:24,754
I've worked with him before.

165
00:19:24,891 --> 00:19:25,721
Here he comes.

166
00:19:29,561 --> 00:19:30,936
OK Let's go.

167
00:19:31,062 --> 00:19:32,888
Now, don't you forget this.

168
00:19:33,022 --> 00:19:34,765
Why I should stick
my neck out for you...

169
00:19:34,898 --> 00:19:36,807
is quite beyond my capacity.

170
00:19:42,612 --> 00:19:44,403
Thank the maker!

171
00:19:44,531 --> 00:19:46,523
This oil bath is going to feel so good.

172
00:19:46,657 --> 00:19:50,274
I've got such a bad case
of dust contamination...

173
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,441
I can barely move.

174
00:19:51,578 --> 00:19:52,609
It just isn't fair.

175
00:19:52,745 --> 00:19:54,287
Oh, Biggs is right.

176
00:19:54,413 --> 00:19:56,701
I'm never gonna get out of here.

177
00:19:56,832 --> 00:19:58,789
Is there anything I might do to help?

178
00:19:58,917 --> 00:20:01,324
No. Not unless you can alter time...

179
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,832
speed up the harvest,
or teleport me off this rock.

180
00:20:03,962 --> 00:20:05,539
I don't think so, sir.

181
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:07,000
I'm only a droid...

182
00:20:07,131 --> 00:20:08,541
and not very knowledgeable
about such things...

183
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,382
not on this planet, anyway.

184
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:13,877
As a matter of fact,
I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.

185
00:20:14,011 --> 00:20:16,383
Well, if there's
a bright centre to the universe...

186
00:20:16,513 --> 00:20:18,920
you're on the planet
that it's farthest from.

187
00:20:19,057 --> 00:20:20,171
I see, sir.

188
00:20:20,308 --> 00:20:22,016
You can call me Luke.

189
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,518
I see, Sir Luke.

190
00:20:23,644 --> 00:20:24,842
Ha ha.

191
00:20:24,978 --> 00:20:26,223
Just Luke.

192
00:20:26,354 --> 00:20:30,018
Oh... And I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

193
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:32,521
This is my counterpart... R2-D2.

194
00:20:32,651 --> 00:20:33,849
Hello.

195
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:37,358
You got a lot of carbon scoring.

196
00:20:37,488 --> 00:20:39,527
Looks like you boys have
seen a lot of action.

197
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,280
With all we've been through...

198
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,150
sometimes I'm amazed we're in
as good condition as we are...

199
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:44,659
what with the rebellion and all.

200
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,658
You know of the rebellion
against the Empire!?

201
00:20:46,786 --> 00:20:48,825
That's how we came
to be in your service...

202
00:20:48,955 --> 00:20:50,330
if you take my meaning, sir.

203
00:20:50,456 --> 00:20:51,570
Have you been in many battles?

204
00:20:51,707 --> 00:20:52,987
Several, I think.

205
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,619
Actually, there's not much to tell.

206
00:20:54,751 --> 00:20:56,577
I'm not much more
than an interpreter...

207
00:20:56,711 --> 00:20:58,537
and not very good at telling stories.

208
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,995
Well, not at making them
interesting, anyway.

209
00:21:01,131 --> 00:21:03,088
Well, my little friend...

210
00:21:03,216 --> 00:21:06,002
you got something jammed
in here real good.

211
00:21:06,134 --> 00:21:07,509
Were you on a Starcruiser or...

212
00:21:07,636 --> 00:21:11,004
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

213
00:21:11,138 --> 00:21:13,177
What's this?

214
00:21:13,307 --> 00:21:15,299
"What is what"?
He asked you a question.

215
00:21:15,433 --> 00:21:16,382
What is that?

216
00:21:16,517 --> 00:21:17,892
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

217
00:21:18,018 --> 00:21:20,140
You're my only hope.

218
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,564
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

219
00:21:25,691 --> 00:21:27,399
You're my only hope.

220
00:21:29,069 --> 00:21:31,820
He says it's nothing, sir,
merely a malfunction.

221
00:21:31,946 --> 00:21:34,353
Old data. Pay it no mind.

222
00:21:34,489 --> 00:21:36,861
Who is she?
She's beautiful.

223
00:21:36,991 --> 00:21:40,324
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

224
00:21:40,452 --> 00:21:42,824
I think she was a passenger
on our last voyage.

225
00:21:42,954 --> 00:21:44,662
A person of some importance, I believe.

226
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:45,868
Our captain was attached...

227
00:21:45,998 --> 00:21:47,160
Is there any more
to this recording?

228
00:21:49,209 --> 00:21:50,584
Behave yourself, R2.

229
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,501
You're going to get us into trouble.

230
00:21:52,628 --> 00:21:55,379
It's all right. You can trust him.
He's our new master.

231
00:21:58,174 --> 00:22:01,542
He says that he's the property
of Obi-Wan Kenobi...

232
00:22:01,677 --> 00:22:03,135
a resident of these parts...

233
00:22:03,261 --> 00:22:05,052
and it's a private message for him.

234
00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:07,136
Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what
he's talking about.

235
00:22:07,264 --> 00:22:09,221
Our last master
was Captain Antilles.

236
00:22:09,349 --> 00:22:10,807
But with all
we've been through...

237
00:22:10,934 --> 00:22:13,970
this little R2 unit has
become a bit eccentric.

238
00:22:14,103 --> 00:22:17,222
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.

239
00:22:17,355 --> 00:22:19,976
I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know
what he's talking about?

240
00:22:20,107 --> 00:22:21,980
I don't know any Obi-Wan...

241
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:25,477
but old Ben lives out
beyond the Dune Sea.

242
00:22:25,612 --> 00:22:27,355
He's kind of a strange old hermit.

243
00:22:27,488 --> 00:22:28,898
Help me,
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

244
00:22:29,031 --> 00:22:30,489
I wonder who she is.

245
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:31,646
Sounds like she's in trouble.

246
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:33,656
I better play back the whole thing.

247
00:22:35,536 --> 00:22:37,742
He says the restraining bolt...

248
00:22:37,871 --> 00:22:40,540
has short-circuited
his recording system.

249
00:22:40,665 --> 00:22:43,451
He suggests that if you remove the bolt...

250
00:22:43,584 --> 00:22:45,872
he might be able to play
back the entire recording.

251
00:22:46,002 --> 00:22:48,374
Oh, yeah. Well...

252
00:22:48,504 --> 00:22:50,911
I guess you're too small
to run away on me...

253
00:22:51,048 --> 00:22:52,246
if I take this off.

254
00:22:52,382 --> 00:22:53,378
OK...

255
00:22:55,968 --> 00:22:57,877
There you go.

256
00:22:58,011 --> 00:23:00,003
Wait a minute.
Where'd she go?

257
00:23:00,138 --> 00:23:02,593
Bring her back.
Play back the entire message.

258
00:23:02,723 --> 00:23:03,802
"What message"?

259
00:23:03,933 --> 00:23:06,091
The one you've just been playing!

260
00:23:06,226 --> 00:23:08,218
The one you're carrying
inside your rusty innards.

261
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:10,429
Luke! Luke!

262
00:23:10,563 --> 00:23:11,973
All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.

263
00:23:12,105 --> 00:23:13,563
I'm sorry, sir...

264
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:16,476
but he appears to have
picked up a slight flutter.

265
00:23:16,609 --> 00:23:18,233
Here. See what you can do with him.

266
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,984
I'll be right back.

267
00:23:21,654 --> 00:23:25,437
Just you reconsider playing
that message for him.

268
00:23:26,825 --> 00:23:29,031
No, I don't think he likes you at all.

269
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,485
No, I don't like you, either.

270
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:41,369
You know, I think that R2 unit
we bought might have been stolen.

271
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,076
What makes you think that?

272
00:23:44,213 --> 00:23:46,620
Well, I stumbled across a recording
while I was cleaning him.

273
00:23:46,757 --> 00:23:49,710
He says he belongs to someone
called Obi-Wan Kenobi.

274
00:23:51,636 --> 00:23:54,008
I thought he might have meant old Ben.

275
00:23:54,137 --> 00:23:55,547
Do you know what
he's talking about?

276
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,676
Mm-mm.

277
00:23:56,806 --> 00:23:59,890
I wonder if he's related to Ben.

278
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,760
That wizard's just a crazy old man.

279
00:24:01,893 --> 00:24:05,261
Tomorrow, I want you to take
that R2 unit to Anchorhead...

280
00:24:05,396 --> 00:24:06,854
and have its memory erased.

281
00:24:06,981 --> 00:24:08,938
That'll be the end of it.
It belongs to us now.

282
00:24:10,692 --> 00:24:13,313
But what if this Obi-Wan
comes looking for him?

283
00:24:13,444 --> 00:24:14,475
He won't.

284
00:24:14,611 --> 00:24:16,983
I don't think he exists any more.

285
00:24:17,113 --> 00:24:19,485
He died about the same time
as your father.

286
00:24:19,615 --> 00:24:20,860
He knew my father?

287
00:24:20,991 --> 00:24:22,699
I told you to forget it.

288
00:24:22,826 --> 00:24:27,202
Your only concern is to prepare
those new droids for tomorrow.

289
00:24:27,329 --> 00:24:29,238
In the morning, I want them
up there on the south ridge...

290
00:24:29,373 --> 00:24:31,199
working on those condensers.

291
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:32,364
Yes, sir.

292
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,367
I think those new droids
are gonna work out fine.

293
00:24:36,503 --> 00:24:40,203
In fact, I, uh, was also thinking
about our agreement...

294
00:24:40,339 --> 00:24:43,541
about me staying on another season?

295
00:24:43,675 --> 00:24:45,833
And if these new droids
do work out...

296
00:24:45,969 --> 00:24:47,878
I want to transmit my application
to the academy this year.

297
00:24:48,012 --> 00:24:50,763
You mean the next semester
before the harvest?

298
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:52,680
Sure. There's more
than enough droids.

299
00:24:52,807 --> 00:24:54,799
Harvest is when I need you the most.

300
00:24:54,934 --> 00:24:56,926
It's only one season more.

301
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,637
This year we'll make
enough on the harvest...

302
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,347
that I'll be able
to hire more hands...

303
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,397
and then you can go
to the academy next year.

304
00:25:03,524 --> 00:25:05,232
You must understand
I need you here, Luke.

305
00:25:05,358 --> 00:25:07,101
But it's a whole 'nother year!

306
00:25:07,235 --> 00:25:08,645
Look, it's only one more season.

307
00:25:08,778 --> 00:25:10,854
Yeah, that's what you said
when Biggs and Tank left.

308
00:25:10,988 --> 00:25:11,901
Where are you going?

309
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,228
Looks like I'm going nowhere.

310
00:25:13,365 --> 00:25:15,156
I have to go finish
cleaning those droids.

311
00:25:15,283 --> 00:25:17,192
Owen, he can't stay here forever.

312
00:25:17,326 --> 00:25:18,606
Most of his friends have gone.

313
00:25:18,744 --> 00:25:20,820
It means so much to him.

314
00:25:20,954 --> 00:25:22,697
I'll make it up to him next year.

315
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:23,826
I promise.

316
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:27,324
Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.

317
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,451
He has too much of his father in him.

318
00:25:29,585 --> 00:25:31,624
That's what I'm afraid of.

319
00:26:19,081 --> 00:26:20,789
Ooh!

320
00:26:20,916 --> 00:26:22,326
What are you doing
hiding back there?

321
00:26:22,459 --> 00:26:25,744
It wasn't my fault, sir.
Please don't deactivate me.

322
00:26:25,878 --> 00:26:28,712
I told him not to go,
but he's faulty, malfunctioning.

323
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,381
Kept babbling on about his mission.

324
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:32,131
Oh, no.

325
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,884
That R2 unit has always
been a problem.

326
00:26:43,016 --> 00:26:45,506
These astrodroids
are getting quite out of hand.

327
00:26:45,643 --> 00:26:47,600
Even I can't understand
their logic at times.

328
00:26:47,728 --> 00:26:49,186
How could I be so stupid?

329
00:26:49,313 --> 00:26:50,475
He's nowhere in sight.

330
00:26:50,605 --> 00:26:51,933
Blast it!

331
00:26:52,065 --> 00:26:54,472
Pardon me, sir,
but couldn't we go after him?

332
00:26:54,608 --> 00:26:56,268
It's too dangerous
with all the Sandpeople around.

333
00:26:56,401 --> 00:26:58,440
We'll have to wait until morning.

334
00:26:58,570 --> 00:26:59,768
Luke! I'm shutting the power down.

335
00:26:59,904 --> 00:27:02,276
All right!
I'll be there in a few minutes.

336
00:27:02,406 --> 00:27:03,864
Boy, am I gonna get it.

337
00:27:03,991 --> 00:27:06,825
That little droid's going to
cause me a lotta trouble.

338
00:27:06,951 --> 00:27:09,276
Oh, he excels at that, sir.

339
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,828
Come on.

340
00:27:19,294 --> 00:27:20,492
Luke?

341
00:27:21,754 --> 00:27:22,916
Luke!

342
00:27:24,423 --> 00:27:25,751
Luke!

343
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,758
Have you seen Luke this morning?

344
00:27:33,888 --> 00:27:35,880
He said he had some things to do
before he started today...

345
00:27:36,015 --> 00:27:37,295
so he left early.

346
00:27:37,433 --> 00:27:38,843
Did he take those
two new droids with him?

347
00:27:38,976 --> 00:27:40,434
I think so.

348
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,133
Well, he better have those units
in the south range...

349
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,725
repaired by midday,
or there'll be hell to pay.

350
00:27:45,939 --> 00:27:47,730
Lookit, there's a droid on the scanner.

351
00:27:47,857 --> 00:27:49,351
Dead ahead.

352
00:27:49,484 --> 00:27:52,484
It might be our little R2 unit.
Hit the accelerator!

353
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:16,496
Hey, whoa! Where do
you think you're going?

354
00:28:17,922 --> 00:28:19,665
Master Luke is your rightful owner now.

355
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:22,798
We'll have no more
of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.

356
00:28:24,385 --> 00:28:25,630
And don't talk to me
of your mission, either.

357
00:28:25,761 --> 00:28:27,006
You're fortunate he doesn't blast you...

358
00:28:27,137 --> 00:28:28,547
into a million pieces right here!

359
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,756
No. It's all right,
but I think we'd better go.

360
00:28:32,475 --> 00:28:34,384
What's wrong with him now?

361
00:28:34,518 --> 00:28:36,759
There are several creatures
approaching from the southeast.

362
00:28:36,895 --> 00:28:40,726
Sandpeople, or worse.

363
00:28:40,856 --> 00:28:42,729
Come on.
Let's go have a look.

364
00:28:42,858 --> 00:28:43,937
Come on!

365
00:28:46,027 --> 00:28:49,312
Well, there are
two Banthas down there...

366
00:28:49,446 --> 00:28:51,403
but I don't see any...
Wait a second.

367
00:28:51,531 --> 00:28:52,906
They're Sandpeople, all right.

368
00:28:53,032 --> 00:28:55,783
I can see one of them now.

369
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,214
Hello, there.

370
00:30:13,635 --> 00:30:16,884
Come here, my little friend.
Don't be afraid.

371
00:30:18,973 --> 00:30:21,345
Oh, don't worry.
He'll be all right.

372
00:30:27,271 --> 00:30:30,057
Rest easy, son.
You've had a busy day.

373
00:30:30,189 --> 00:30:33,937
You're fortunate
to be all in one piece.

374
00:30:36,402 --> 00:30:37,682
Ben?

375
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,314
Ben Kenobi?

376
00:30:39,446 --> 00:30:41,403
Boy, am I glad to see you.

377
00:30:41,531 --> 00:30:44,531
The Jundland Wastes are not
to be travelled lightly.

378
00:30:46,702 --> 00:30:48,778
Tell me, young Luke...

379
00:30:48,912 --> 00:30:51,782
what brings you out this far?

380
00:30:51,914 --> 00:30:53,574
This little droid.

381
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:57,209
I think he's searching
for his former master...

382
00:30:57,335 --> 00:31:00,703
but I've never seen such devotion
in a droid before.

383
00:31:00,838 --> 00:31:02,747
He claims to be the property...

384
00:31:02,881 --> 00:31:04,458
of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

385
00:31:04,591 --> 00:31:05,753
Is he a relative of yours?

386
00:31:05,883 --> 00:31:08,255
Do you know who
he's talking about?

387
00:31:08,385 --> 00:31:10,507
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

388
00:31:12,096 --> 00:31:14,254
Obi-Wan.

389
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:19,300
Now, that's a name
I've not heard in a long time.

390
00:31:19,435 --> 00:31:21,842
A long time.

391
00:31:21,979 --> 00:31:24,267
I think my uncle knows him.

392
00:31:24,397 --> 00:31:25,891
He said he was dead.

393
00:31:26,024 --> 00:31:27,815
Oh, he's not dead.

394
00:31:27,942 --> 00:31:29,056
Not yet.

395
00:31:29,193 --> 00:31:30,603
You know him?

396
00:31:30,736 --> 00:31:33,606
Well, of course I know him.
He's me.

397
00:31:35,698 --> 00:31:39,564
I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan...

398
00:31:39,701 --> 00:31:42,108
since, oh, before you were born.

399
00:31:42,244 --> 00:31:44,035
Well, then the droid
does belong to you.

400
00:31:44,162 --> 00:31:46,866
I don't seem to remember
ever owning a droid.

401
00:31:48,666 --> 00:31:49,864
Very interesting.

402
00:31:51,418 --> 00:31:54,252
I think we better get indoors.

403
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:56,834
The Sandpeople are easily startled...

404
00:31:56,964 --> 00:32:00,332
but they'll soon be back,
and in greater numbers.

405
00:32:03,177 --> 00:32:04,587
3PO.

406
00:32:13,935 --> 00:32:16,639
Where am I?
I must have taken a bad step.

407
00:32:18,147 --> 00:32:19,724
Can you stand?

408
00:32:19,856 --> 00:32:21,398
We've got to get out of here before
the Sandpeople return.

409
00:32:21,524 --> 00:32:24,014
I don't think I can make it.
You go on, Master Luke.

410
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:26,820
There's no sense in you risking yourself
on my account.

411
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,320
I'm done for.

412
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,189
No, you're not.

413
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,354
What kind of talk is that?

414
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,114
Quickly. They're on the move.

415
00:32:37,953 --> 00:32:39,992
No, my father didn't
fight in the wars.

416
00:32:40,122 --> 00:32:41,865
He was a navigator
on a spice freighter.

417
00:32:41,998 --> 00:32:43,824
That's what your uncle told you.

418
00:32:43,958 --> 00:32:45,749
He didn't hold
with your father's ideals.

419
00:32:45,876 --> 00:32:47,038
Thought he should
have stayed here...

420
00:32:47,169 --> 00:32:48,995
and not gotten involved.

421
00:32:49,129 --> 00:32:51,038
You fought in the Clone Wars?

422
00:32:51,172 --> 00:32:54,042
Yes. I was once a Jedi knight...

423
00:32:54,174 --> 00:32:55,454
the same as your father.

424
00:32:58,052 --> 00:32:59,795
I wish I'd known him.

425
00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:03,712
He was the best starpilot in the galaxy...

426
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,390
and a cunning warrior.

427
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:06,429
I understand you've become...

428
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:09,263
quite a good pilot yourself.

429
00:33:09,394 --> 00:33:12,264
And he was a good friend.

430
00:33:12,396 --> 00:33:14,518
Which reminds me...

431
00:33:14,648 --> 00:33:17,352
I have something here for you.

432
00:33:19,527 --> 00:33:22,361
Your father wanted you to have this...

433
00:33:22,487 --> 00:33:23,862
when you were old enough...

434
00:33:23,989 --> 00:33:26,028
but your uncle
wouldn't allow it.

435
00:33:26,157 --> 00:33:27,699
He feared you might
follow old Obi-Wan...

436
00:33:27,825 --> 00:33:29,782
on some damn-fool
idealistic crusade...

437
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,653
like your father did.

438
00:33:31,786 --> 00:33:33,577
Sir, if you'll not be needing me...

439
00:33:33,704 --> 00:33:34,653
I'll close down for a while.

440
00:33:34,788 --> 00:33:36,448
Sure. Go ahead.

441
00:33:37,832 --> 00:33:39,658
What is it?

442
00:33:39,792 --> 00:33:42,543
It's your father's lightsaber.

443
00:33:42,669 --> 00:33:45,918
This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.

444
00:33:46,047 --> 00:33:49,664
Not as clumsy or random
as a blaster.

445
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:55,884
An elegant weapon
for a more civilised age.

446
00:33:56,013 --> 00:33:58,219
For over a thousand generations...

447
00:33:58,348 --> 00:34:00,221
the Jedi knights were the guardians...

448
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:03,386
of peace and justice
in the old Republic...

449
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,305
before the dark times...

450
00:34:06,438 --> 00:34:08,015
before the Empire.

451
00:34:10,566 --> 00:34:12,973
How did my father die?

452
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:17,355
A young Jedi named Darth Vader...

453
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:20,607
who was a pupil of mine
until he turned to evil...

454
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:24,737
helped the Empire hunt down
and destroy the Jedi knights.

455
00:34:26,328 --> 00:34:28,949
He betrayed and
murdered your father.

456
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:32,993
Now the Jedi are all but extinct.

457
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:38,000
Vader was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

458
00:34:38,128 --> 00:34:39,622
The Force?

459
00:34:39,755 --> 00:34:43,123
The Force is what gives
a Jedi his power.

460
00:34:43,257 --> 00:34:47,301
It's an energy field created
by all living things.

461
00:34:47,427 --> 00:34:49,253
It surrounds us, penetrates us...

462
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:51,426
it binds the galaxy together.

463
00:34:57,893 --> 00:35:01,972
Now let's see if we can't figure out
what you are, my little friend...

464
00:35:02,105 --> 00:35:04,014
and where you come from.

465
00:35:04,148 --> 00:35:05,725
I saw part of a message he was...

466
00:35:05,858 --> 00:35:07,850
I seem to have found it.

467
00:35:07,985 --> 00:35:12,064
General Kenobi, years ago
you served my father in the Clone Wars.

468
00:35:12,196 --> 00:35:13,524
Now he begs you to help him...

469
00:35:13,655 --> 00:35:15,861
in his struggle against the Empire.

470
00:35:15,991 --> 00:35:18,742
I regret that I am unable to present
my father's request to you in person.

471
00:35:18,868 --> 00:35:20,825
But my ship has fallen under attack...

472
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:23,159
and I am afraid my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed.

473
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:24,996
I have placed information...

474
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,747
vital to the survival
of the rebellion...

475
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,700
into the memory systems
of this R2 unit.

476
00:35:28,834 --> 00:35:30,625
My father will know
how to retrieve it.

477
00:35:30,752 --> 00:35:32,376
You must see this droid...

478
00:35:32,503 --> 00:35:35,040
safely delivered to him on Alderaan.

479
00:35:35,172 --> 00:35:36,880
This is our most desperate hour.

480
00:35:37,007 --> 00:35:41,086
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

481
00:35:55,187 --> 00:35:57,724
You must learn
the ways of the Force...

482
00:35:57,856 --> 00:36:00,062
if you're to come
with me to Alderaan.

483
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:02,598
Alderaan?
I'm not going to Alderaan.

484
00:36:02,735 --> 00:36:04,193
I've got to get home.

485
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:05,647
It's late.
I'm in for it as it is.

486
00:36:05,779 --> 00:36:08,530
I need your help, Luke.
She needs your help.

487
00:36:08,656 --> 00:36:11,775
I'm getting too old
for this sort of thing.

488
00:36:15,828 --> 00:36:17,203
I can't get involved.

489
00:36:17,329 --> 00:36:19,701
I've got work to do.

490
00:36:19,831 --> 00:36:22,368
It's not that I like the Empire.
I hate it...

491
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,702
but there's nothing
I can do about it right now.

492
00:36:25,836 --> 00:36:27,958
It's all such a long way from here.

493
00:36:28,087 --> 00:36:30,044
That's your uncle talking.

494
00:36:30,172 --> 00:36:31,370
My uncle.

495
00:36:31,507 --> 00:36:33,997
How am I ever gonna explain this?

496
00:36:34,134 --> 00:36:35,877
Learn about the Force, Luke.

497
00:36:42,848 --> 00:36:45,089
Look, I can take you
as far as Anchorhead.

498
00:36:45,225 --> 00:36:49,222
You can get a transport there to
Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

499
00:36:49,353 --> 00:36:53,302
You must do what you feel
is right, of course.

500
00:37:01,071 --> 00:37:03,110
Until this battle station
is fully operational...

501
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:04,649
we are vulnerable.

502
00:37:04,782 --> 00:37:06,821
The Rebel Alliance
is too well equipped.

503
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,907
They're more dangerous
than you realise.

504
00:37:09,035 --> 00:37:11,407
Dangerous to
your starfleet, Commander...

505
00:37:11,537 --> 00:37:13,695
not to this battle station.

506
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:16,534
The rebellion will
continue to gain support...

507
00:37:16,666 --> 00:37:18,326
in the Imperial Senate...

508
00:37:18,459 --> 00:37:21,578
The Imperial Senate will no longer
be of any concern to us.

509
00:37:21,711 --> 00:37:23,253
I have just received word...

510
00:37:23,379 --> 00:37:25,916
that the emperor has
dissolved the council permanently.

511
00:37:26,048 --> 00:37:28,585
The last remnants
of the old Republic...

512
00:37:28,717 --> 00:37:30,127
have been swept away.

513
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,920
That's impossible.

514
00:37:32,053 --> 00:37:34,294
How will the emperor maintain control
without the bureaucracy?

515
00:37:34,429 --> 00:37:37,299
The regional governors
now have direct control...

516
00:37:37,432 --> 00:37:39,140
over their territories.

517
00:37:39,267 --> 00:37:43,311
Fear will keep
the local systems in line...

518
00:37:43,436 --> 00:37:44,811
fear of this battle station.

519
00:37:44,937 --> 00:37:46,763
And what of the rebellion?

520
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:48,770
If the rebels have obtained...

521
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:50,144
a complete technical readout
of this station...

522
00:37:50,275 --> 00:37:51,935
it is possible, however unlikely...

523
00:37:52,068 --> 00:37:54,356
that they might find a weakness
and exploit it.

524
00:37:54,486 --> 00:37:58,697
The plans you refer to will
soon be back in our hands.

525
00:37:58,823 --> 00:38:01,230
Any attack made by the rebels
against this station...

526
00:38:01,367 --> 00:38:02,695
would be a useless gesture...

527
00:38:02,826 --> 00:38:05,151
no matter what technical data
they've obtained.

528
00:38:05,286 --> 00:38:08,868
This station is now the ultimate power
in the universe.

529
00:38:08,997 --> 00:38:11,285
I suggest we use it.

530
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:12,826
Don't be too proud...

531
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:15,165
of this technological terror
you've constructed.

532
00:38:15,294 --> 00:38:18,662
The ability to destroy
a planet is insignificant...

533
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:21,038
next to the power of the Force.

534
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:24,588
Don't try to frighten us with
your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.

535
00:38:24,718 --> 00:38:27,635
Your sad devotion
to that ancient religion...

536
00:38:27,762 --> 00:38:30,217
hasn't helped you conjure up
the stolen data tapes...

537
00:38:30,347 --> 00:38:32,304
or given you
clairvoyance enough...

538
00:38:32,432 --> 00:38:34,638
to find the rebels'
hidden fortre...

539
00:38:40,605 --> 00:38:43,439
I find your lack
of faith disturbing.

540
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,973
Enough of this.
Vader, release him.

541
00:38:48,111 --> 00:38:49,688
As you wish.

542
00:38:51,864 --> 00:38:53,903
This bickering is pointless.

543
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:58,776
Lord Vader will provide us with
the location of the rebel fortress...

544
00:38:58,911 --> 00:39:01,697
by the time this station
is operational.

545
00:39:01,829 --> 00:39:04,154
We will then crush the rebellion...

546
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:05,700
with one swift stroke.

547
00:39:12,504 --> 00:39:14,496
It looks like the Sandpeople
did this, all right.

548
00:39:14,631 --> 00:39:16,339
Look. There's gaffi sticks,
Bantha tracks.

549
00:39:16,466 --> 00:39:17,497
It's just, I've never heard of them...

550
00:39:17,633 --> 00:39:18,582
hitting anything this big before.

551
00:39:18,717 --> 00:39:19,748
They didn't...

552
00:39:19,885 --> 00:39:22,340
but we are meant to think they did.

553
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:24,343
These tracks are side-by-side.

554
00:39:24,472 --> 00:39:26,630
Sandpeople always ride single file...

555
00:39:26,765 --> 00:39:28,638
to hide their numbers.

556
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:31,055
These are the same Jawas
that sold us R2 and 3PO.

557
00:39:31,185 --> 00:39:34,636
And these blast points,
too accurate...

558
00:39:34,771 --> 00:39:36,099
for Sandpeople.

559
00:39:36,231 --> 00:39:39,646
Only imperial stormtroopers
are so precise.

560
00:39:39,775 --> 00:39:42,941
But why would imperial troops
want to slaughter Jawas?

561
00:39:47,489 --> 00:39:49,647
If they traced the robots here...

562
00:39:49,783 --> 00:39:50,981
they may have learned
who they sold them to...

563
00:39:51,117 --> 00:39:53,109
and that would lead
them back... home!

564
00:39:53,244 --> 00:39:54,786
Wait, Luke!

565
00:39:54,912 --> 00:39:56,869
It's too dangerous!

566
00:40:20,681 --> 00:40:22,175
Uncle Owen!

567
00:40:22,307 --> 00:40:24,714
Aunt Beru!

568
00:40:24,851 --> 00:40:26,179
Uncle Owen!

569
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,681
And now, Your Highness...

570
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,680
we will discuss the location...

571
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,050
of your hidden rebel base.

572
00:42:03,843 --> 00:42:05,716
There's nothing you could
have done, Luke...

573
00:42:05,845 --> 00:42:07,387
had you been there.

574
00:42:07,513 --> 00:42:09,221
You'd have been killed, too...

575
00:42:09,347 --> 00:42:12,929
and the droids would now be
in the hands of the Empire.

576
00:42:13,059 --> 00:42:16,723
I want to come
with you to Alderaan.

577
00:42:16,853 --> 00:42:18,596
There's nothing for me here now.

578
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:20,936
I want to learn
the ways of the Force...

579
00:42:21,065 --> 00:42:22,559
and become a Jedi
like my father.

580
00:42:37,786 --> 00:42:40,620
Mos Eisley spaceport.

581
00:42:40,746 --> 00:42:45,952
You will never find a more
wretched hive of scum and villainy.

582
00:42:46,084 --> 00:42:48,041
We must be cautious.

583
00:43:29,492 --> 00:43:31,698
How long have you
had these droids?

584
00:43:31,827 --> 00:43:33,025
Three or four seasons.

585
00:43:33,161 --> 00:43:34,441
They're up for sale
if you want them.

586
00:43:34,579 --> 00:43:36,405
Let me see your identification.

587
00:43:36,539 --> 00:43:39,824
You don't need to see
his identification.

588
00:43:39,958 --> 00:43:42,283
We don't need to see
his identification.

589
00:43:42,418 --> 00:43:44,743
These aren't the droids
you're looking for.

590
00:43:44,879 --> 00:43:47,749
These aren't the droids
we're looking for.

591
00:43:47,881 --> 00:43:50,253
He can go about his business.

592
00:43:50,383 --> 00:43:52,755
You can go about your business.

593
00:43:52,885 --> 00:43:53,834
Move along.

594
00:43:53,969 --> 00:43:55,167
Move along.

595
00:43:55,303 --> 00:43:56,465
Move along.

596
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:15,723
I can't abide those Jawas.
Disgusting creatures!

597
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:18,315
Go on, go on.

598
00:44:19,864 --> 00:44:22,070
I can't understand how
we got by those troops.

599
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:23,574
I thought we were dead.

600
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:26,404
The Force can have
a strong influence...

601
00:44:26,535 --> 00:44:27,993
on the weak-minded.

602
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:32,616
Do you really think we're
gonna find a pilot here...

603
00:44:32,748 --> 00:44:34,290
that'll take us to Alderaan?

604
00:44:34,416 --> 00:44:37,333
Most of the best freighter pilots
are to be found here...

605
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:38,835
only watch your step.

606
00:44:38,961 --> 00:44:40,669
This place can be a little rough.

607
00:44:40,796 --> 00:44:42,872
I'm ready for anything.

608
00:44:46,384 --> 00:44:47,926
Come along, R2.

609
00:45:38,382 --> 00:45:41,418
Hey! We don't serve their kind here.

610
00:45:41,551 --> 00:45:42,464
What?

611
00:45:42,593 --> 00:45:44,170
Your droids,
they'll have to wait outside.

612
00:45:44,303 --> 00:45:45,417
We don't want them here.

613
00:45:45,554 --> 00:45:46,668
Why don't you wait
out by the speeder?

614
00:45:46,805 --> 00:45:47,836
We don't want any trouble.

615
00:45:47,972 --> 00:45:49,845
I heartily agree with you, sir.

616
00:45:58,314 --> 00:45:59,476
Uh...

617
00:45:59,606 --> 00:46:00,886
I'll have one of those.

618
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:38,134
He doesn't like you.

619
00:46:38,261 --> 00:46:40,004
I'm sorry.

620
00:46:40,137 --> 00:46:42,710
I don't like you, either.

621
00:46:42,848 --> 00:46:44,639
You just watch yourself.

622
00:46:44,766 --> 00:46:45,928
We're wanted men.

623
00:46:46,058 --> 00:46:49,307
I have the death sentence on 12 systems.

624
00:46:49,436 --> 00:46:50,894
I'll be careful.

625
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:52,218
You'll be dead!

626
00:46:52,355 --> 00:46:54,228
This little one's not worth the effort.

627
00:46:54,356 --> 00:46:56,597
Come, let me get you something.

628
00:47:03,238 --> 00:47:05,444
Aah!

629
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:25,164
I'm all right.

630
00:47:26,339 --> 00:47:28,711
Chewbacca here is first mate...

631
00:47:28,841 --> 00:47:31,841
on a ship that might suit us.

632
00:47:34,846 --> 00:47:38,297
I don't like the look of this.

633
00:47:52,776 --> 00:47:56,820
Han Solo. I'm captain
of the Millennium Falcon.

634
00:47:56,946 --> 00:48:00,279
Chewie here tells me you're looking
for passage to the Alderaan system.

635
00:48:00,407 --> 00:48:02,695
Yes, indeed,
if it's a fast ship.

636
00:48:02,825 --> 00:48:05,695
Fast ship? You've never heard
of the Millennium Falcon?

637
00:48:05,827 --> 00:48:08,282
Should I have?

638
00:48:08,413 --> 00:48:11,615
It's the ship that made the Kessel run
in less than 12 parsecs.

639
00:48:13,542 --> 00:48:15,748
I've outrun imperial starships.

640
00:48:15,877 --> 00:48:17,916
Not the local bulk cruisers,
mind you.

641
00:48:18,045 --> 00:48:20,167
I'm talking about
the big Corellian ships now.

642
00:48:22,006 --> 00:48:24,294
She's fast enough for you,
old man.

643
00:48:24,425 --> 00:48:26,049
What's the cargo?

644
00:48:26,176 --> 00:48:29,260
Only passengers...
myself, the boy...

645
00:48:29,387 --> 00:48:30,881
two droids...

646
00:48:31,013 --> 00:48:33,930
and no questions asked.

647
00:48:34,057 --> 00:48:37,057
What is it, some kind
of local trouble?

648
00:48:37,185 --> 00:48:40,269
Let's just say we'd like to avoid...

649
00:48:40,395 --> 00:48:42,304
any imperial entanglements.

650
00:48:42,439 --> 00:48:46,187
Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?

651
00:48:46,317 --> 00:48:48,605
And it's gonna cost you
something extra.

652
00:48:50,403 --> 00:48:52,194
10,000, all in advance.

653
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:55,144
10,000?

654
00:48:55,282 --> 00:48:59,030
We could almost
buy our own ship for that!

655
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,366
But who's gonna fly it,
kid, you?

656
00:49:01,495 --> 00:49:03,534
You bet I could.
I'm not such a bad pilot myself.

657
00:49:03,663 --> 00:49:06,035
We don't have
to sit here and listen...

658
00:49:06,165 --> 00:49:09,249
We can pay you 2,000 now...

659
00:49:09,376 --> 00:49:12,376
plus 15 when
we reach Alderaan.

660
00:49:12,503 --> 00:49:14,376
Seventeen, huh?

661
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:20,289
OK You guys got
yourselves a ship.

662
00:49:20,426 --> 00:49:21,671
We'll leave as soon
as you're ready.

663
00:49:21,802 --> 00:49:22,881
Docking Bay 94.

664
00:49:23,011 --> 00:49:24,173
Ninety-four.

665
00:49:25,889 --> 00:49:28,130
Looks like somebody's
beginning to take an interest...

666
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:30,637
in your handiwork.

667
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:32,889
All right.
We'll check it out.

668
00:49:44,778 --> 00:49:46,153
17,000!

669
00:49:46,279 --> 00:49:47,821
Those guys must really
be desperate.

670
00:49:47,947 --> 00:49:49,986
This could really save my neck.

671
00:49:50,115 --> 00:49:52,736
Get back to the ship,
get it ready.

672
00:49:52,867 --> 00:49:54,444
You'll have to sell your speeder.

673
00:49:54,577 --> 00:49:57,910
That's OK I'm never coming back
to this planet again.

674
00:50:00,707 --> 00:50:02,450
Yes, Greedo.

675
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:03,745
As a matter of fact,
I was just going to see your boss.

676
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:05,833
Tell Jabba that I've got his money.

677
00:50:19,304 --> 00:50:21,462
Yeah, but this time I've got the money.

678
00:50:25,267 --> 00:50:27,804
I don't have it with me.

679
00:50:27,936 --> 00:50:28,552
Tell Jabba...

680
00:50:36,567 --> 00:50:38,191
Even I get boarded sometimes.

681
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:40,358
Do you think I had a choice?

682
00:50:44,699 --> 00:50:46,738
Over my dead body.

683
00:50:52,329 --> 00:50:53,609
I'll bet you have.

684
00:51:07,424 --> 00:51:09,297
Sorry about the mess.

685
00:51:18,516 --> 00:51:22,050
Her resistance to the mind probe
is considerable.

686
00:51:22,185 --> 00:51:25,221
It'll be some time before we can
extract any information from her.

687
00:51:25,355 --> 00:51:27,228
The final checkout is completed.

688
00:51:27,356 --> 00:51:28,898
All systems are operational.

689
00:51:29,024 --> 00:51:30,897
What course shall we set?

690
00:51:31,026 --> 00:51:32,650
Perhaps she would respond...

691
00:51:32,777 --> 00:51:34,650
to an alternative
form of persuasion.

692
00:51:34,778 --> 00:51:36,153
What do you mean?

693
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,153
I think it is time
we demonstrated...

694
00:51:38,281 --> 00:51:39,989
the full power of this station.

695
00:51:40,116 --> 00:51:41,610
Set your course for Alderaan.

696
00:51:41,742 --> 00:51:43,117
With pleasure.

697
00:51:43,243 --> 00:51:45,531
Lock the door, R2.

698
00:51:46,788 --> 00:51:50,073
Check this side of the street.

699
00:51:53,459 --> 00:51:56,625
The door's locked.
Move on to the next.

700
00:52:01,757 --> 00:52:04,591
I would much rather have
gone with Master Luke...

701
00:52:04,718 --> 00:52:06,176
than stay here with you.

702
00:52:06,302 --> 00:52:08,590
I don't know what
all this trouble is about...

703
00:52:08,721 --> 00:52:10,381
but I'm sure
it must be your fault.

704
00:52:11,515 --> 00:52:12,760
You watch your language.

705
00:52:14,809 --> 00:52:17,928
All right. Give it to me.
I'll take it.

706
00:52:18,061 --> 00:52:19,603
Look at this.

707
00:52:19,729 --> 00:52:21,721
Ever since the XP-38 came out,
they just aren't in demand.

708
00:52:21,856 --> 00:52:23,314
It'll be enough.

709
00:52:46,833 --> 00:52:48,375
Right here, Jabba.

710
00:52:49,836 --> 00:52:51,330
I've been waitin' for you.

711
00:52:54,548 --> 00:52:56,624
You didn't think
I was gonna run, did you?

712
00:53:08,308 --> 00:53:10,977
Look, Jabba, next time you want to
talk to me, come see me yourself.

713
00:53:11,102 --> 00:53:12,382
Don't send one of these twerps.

714
00:53:26,697 --> 00:53:29,899
Look, Jabba,
even I get boarded sometimes.

715
00:53:31,117 --> 00:53:33,489
You think I had a choice?

716
00:53:33,619 --> 00:53:35,362
But I got a nice, easy charter.

717
00:53:35,495 --> 00:53:37,783
I'll pay ya back,
plus a little extra.

718
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:39,823
I just need a little more time.

719
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:50,039
Fifteen, Jabba. Don't push it.

720
00:54:01,765 --> 00:54:04,386
Jabba... you're a wonderful human being.

721
00:54:13,191 --> 00:54:15,230
If the ship's as fast as he's boasting...

722
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:16,687
we ought to do well.

723
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:42,543
What a piece of junk!

724
00:54:42,672 --> 00:54:44,878
She'll make.5 past light speed.

725
00:54:45,007 --> 00:54:46,465
She may not look like much...

726
00:54:46,591 --> 00:54:48,215
but she's got it
where it counts, kid.

727
00:54:48,343 --> 00:54:51,012
I've made a lot of
special modifications myself.

728
00:54:51,136 --> 00:54:53,591
But we're a little rushed,
so if you'll just get on board...

729
00:54:53,722 --> 00:54:55,132
we'll get outta here.

730
00:54:59,768 --> 00:55:00,966
Hello, sir.

731
00:55:10,109 --> 00:55:11,519
Which way?

732
00:55:13,153 --> 00:55:15,478
All right, men,
load your weapons.

733
00:55:17,031 --> 00:55:19,652
Stop that ship!
Blast them!

734
00:55:28,957 --> 00:55:30,665
Chewie, get us out of here!

735
00:55:32,376 --> 00:55:36,373
Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much
I hate space travel.

736
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:56,555
Looks like an imperial cruiser.

737
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:57,635
Our passengers must be hotter
than I thought.

738
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,348
Try and hold 'em off.

739
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:01,104
Angle the deflector shields
while I make the calculations...

740
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:02,097
for the jump to light speed.

741
00:56:12,365 --> 00:56:14,073
Stay sharp.
There's two more comin' in.

742
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,943
They're gonna try
and cut us off.

743
00:56:16,076 --> 00:56:17,867
Why don't you outrun 'em?
I thought you said this thing was fast!

744
00:56:17,994 --> 00:56:19,867
Watch your mouth, kid, or you're
gonna find yourself floating home.

745
00:56:19,996 --> 00:56:21,324
We'll be safe enough...

746
00:56:21,455 --> 00:56:23,364
once we make the jump
to hyperspace.

747
00:56:23,499 --> 00:56:25,372
Besides, I know a few manoeuvres.
We'll lose 'em.

748
00:56:29,503 --> 00:56:31,412
Here's where the fun begins.

749
00:56:31,546 --> 00:56:33,372
How long before you can make
the jump to light speed?

750
00:56:33,506 --> 00:56:36,175
It'll take a few moments to get
the coordinates from the navicomputer.

751
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,008
Are you kidding?
At the rate they're gaining?

752
00:56:38,135 --> 00:56:41,301
Travelling through hyperspace
ain't like dustin' crops, boy!

753
00:56:41,429 --> 00:56:42,460
Without precise calculations...

754
00:56:42,596 --> 00:56:43,675
we'd fly right through a star...

755
00:56:43,806 --> 00:56:45,264
or bounce too close
to a supernova...

756
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:47,382
and that would end your trip
real quick, wouldn't it?

757
00:56:47,517 --> 00:56:48,513
What's that flashing?

758
00:56:48,643 --> 00:56:49,425
We're losing a deflector shield.

759
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:50,935
Go strap yourselves in.

760
00:56:51,061 --> 00:56:52,887
I'm gonna make the jump to light speed.

761
00:57:13,912 --> 00:57:16,284
We've entered the Alderaan system.

762
00:57:16,414 --> 00:57:17,612
Governor Tarkin.

763
00:57:17,748 --> 00:57:19,158
I should have expected...

764
00:57:19,291 --> 00:57:21,164
to find you holding Vader's leash.

765
00:57:21,293 --> 00:57:22,835
I recognised your foul stench...

766
00:57:22,961 --> 00:57:24,918
when I was brought on board.

767
00:57:26,088 --> 00:57:28,294
Charming to the last.

768
00:57:28,423 --> 00:57:31,044
You don't know
how hard I found it...

769
00:57:31,175 --> 00:57:33,132
signing the order
to terminate your life.

770
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:34,422
I'm surprised you had the courage...

771
00:57:34,553 --> 00:57:36,011
to take the responsibility yourself.

772
00:57:36,137 --> 00:57:39,173
Princess Leia,
before your execution...

773
00:57:39,306 --> 00:57:40,966
I would like you to be my guest...

774
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:44,550
at a ceremony that will make
this battle station operational.

775
00:57:44,685 --> 00:57:47,769
No star system will dare
oppose the emperor now.

776
00:57:47,896 --> 00:57:50,303
The more you tighten
your grip, Tarkin...

777
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,144
the more star systems
will slip through your fingers.

778
00:57:53,275 --> 00:57:56,228
Not after we demonstrate
the power of this station.

779
00:57:56,361 --> 00:57:58,733
In a way,
you have determined...

780
00:57:58,863 --> 00:58:01,697
the choice of the planet
that will be destroyed first.

781
00:58:01,823 --> 00:58:03,649
Since you are reluctant...

782
00:58:03,783 --> 00:58:06,700
to provide us with the location
of the rebel base...

783
00:58:06,827 --> 00:58:09,697
I have chosen to test this station's
destructive power...

784
00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:12,830
on your home planet of Alderaan.

785
00:58:12,957 --> 00:58:14,119
No! Alderaan is peaceful.

786
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:15,708
We have no weapons.
You can't possibly...

787
00:58:15,834 --> 00:58:17,826
You would prefer another target?
A military target?

788
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:20,451
Then name the system.

789
00:58:22,339 --> 00:58:25,672
I grow tired of asking this,
so it will be the last time.

790
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,469
Where is the rebel base?

791
00:58:32,013 --> 00:58:34,171
Dantooine.

792
00:58:34,307 --> 00:58:35,717
They're on Dantooine.

793
00:58:35,849 --> 00:58:38,221
There. You see, Lord Vader?

794
00:58:38,351 --> 00:58:39,761
She can be reasonable.

795
00:58:39,894 --> 00:58:41,685
Continue with the operation.
You may fire when ready.

796
00:58:41,812 --> 00:58:43,270
What?

797
00:58:43,397 --> 00:58:44,725
You're far too trusting.

798
00:58:44,856 --> 00:58:46,314
Dantooine is too remote...

799
00:58:46,441 --> 00:58:48,931
to make an effective demonstration,
but don't worry.

800
00:58:49,068 --> 00:58:51,938
We will deal with your rebel friends
soon enough.

801
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,149
No!

802
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:56,527
Commence primary ignition.

803
00:59:19,633 --> 00:59:22,966
Are you all right?
What's wrong?

804
00:59:23,094 --> 00:59:25,466
I felt a great disturbance
in the Force...

805
00:59:25,596 --> 00:59:27,090
as if millions of voices...

806
00:59:27,222 --> 00:59:29,095
suddenly cried out in terror...

807
00:59:29,223 --> 00:59:30,765
and were suddenly silenced.

808
00:59:30,891 --> 00:59:33,642
I fear something terrible
has happened.

809
00:59:35,061 --> 00:59:37,730
You'd better get on
with your exercises.

810
00:59:39,815 --> 00:59:42,519
Well, you can forget your troubles
with those imperial slugs.

811
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:44,607
I told you I'd outrun them.

812
00:59:48,655 --> 00:59:50,694
Don't everybody thank me at once.

813
00:59:50,823 --> 00:59:55,283
Anyway, we should be at Alderaan
about 02:00 hours.

814
01:00:02,791 --> 01:00:04,582
Now be careful, R2.

815
01:00:12,632 --> 01:00:14,174
Argh!

816
01:00:14,299 --> 01:00:16,042
He made a fair move.
Screaming about it can't help you.

817
01:00:16,176 --> 01:00:18,962
Let him have it. It's not wise
to upset a Wookiee.

818
01:00:19,095 --> 01:00:21,420
But, sir, nobody worries
about upsetting a droid.

819
01:00:21,555 --> 01:00:24,591
That's 'cause a droid don't pull
people's arms out of their sockets...

820
01:00:24,724 --> 01:00:26,099
when they lose.

821
01:00:26,225 --> 01:00:28,264
Wookiees are known to do that.

822
01:00:28,394 --> 01:00:30,018
Grrr...

823
01:00:30,145 --> 01:00:32,600
I see your point, sir.

824
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:34,105
I suggest a new strategy, R2.

825
01:00:34,231 --> 01:00:35,689
Let the Wookiee win.

826
01:00:35,816 --> 01:00:38,306
Argh!

827
01:00:53,621 --> 01:00:57,784
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force
flowing through him.

828
01:00:57,916 --> 01:00:59,908
You mean it controls your actions?

829
01:01:00,043 --> 01:01:02,960
Partially, but it also
obeys your commands.

830
01:01:07,465 --> 01:01:10,501
Hokey religions and
ancient weapons are no match...

831
01:01:10,634 --> 01:01:12,294
for a good blaster
at your side, kid.

832
01:01:12,427 --> 01:01:14,715
You don't believe
in the Force, do you?

833
01:01:14,846 --> 01:01:18,095
Kid, I've flown from
one side of this galaxy to the other.

834
01:01:18,223 --> 01:01:19,765
I've seen a lot of strange stuff...

835
01:01:19,891 --> 01:01:22,179
but I've never seen anything
to make me believe...

836
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:25,761
there's one all-powerful force
controlling everything.

837
01:01:25,896 --> 01:01:29,975
There's no mystical
energy field controls my destiny.

838
01:01:30,107 --> 01:01:34,056
It's all a lot of
simple tricks and nonsense.

839
01:01:34,194 --> 01:01:37,064
I suggest you try it again, Luke.

840
01:01:37,196 --> 01:01:40,113
This time, let go
your conscious self...

841
01:01:42,075 --> 01:01:44,197
and act on instinct.

842
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:47,611
With the blast shield down,
I can't even see.

843
01:01:47,746 --> 01:01:49,121
How am I supposed to fight?

844
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:50,196
Your eyes can deceive you.

845
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:51,410
Don't trust them.

846
01:02:00,839 --> 01:02:03,127
Stretch out with your feelings.

847
01:02:17,602 --> 01:02:19,724
You see? You can do it.

848
01:02:19,854 --> 01:02:21,478
I call it luck.

849
01:02:21,605 --> 01:02:24,178
In my experience,
there's no such thing as luck.

850
01:02:24,315 --> 01:02:26,687
Look, good against remotes
is one thing.

851
01:02:26,817 --> 01:02:29,687
Good against the living,
that's something else.

852
01:02:31,154 --> 01:02:32,778
Looks like we're coming
up on Alderaan.

853
01:02:36,116 --> 01:02:37,396
You know, I did feel something.

854
01:02:37,534 --> 01:02:38,696
I could almost see the remote.

855
01:02:38,826 --> 01:02:39,739
That's good.

856
01:02:39,869 --> 01:02:41,695
You've taken your first step...

857
01:02:41,829 --> 01:02:43,620
into a larger world.

858
01:02:48,083 --> 01:02:49,197
Yes?

859
01:02:49,334 --> 01:02:52,120
Our scout ships have
reached Dantooine.

860
01:02:52,253 --> 01:02:54,126
They found the remains
of a rebel base...

861
01:02:54,255 --> 01:02:56,580
but they estimate that it has
been deserted for some time.

862
01:02:56,715 --> 01:03:00,249
They are now conducting an extensive
search of the surrounding systems.

863
01:03:00,384 --> 01:03:03,337
She lied. She lied to us!

864
01:03:03,470 --> 01:03:06,174
I told you she would never...

865
01:03:06,306 --> 01:03:08,678
consciously betray the rebellion.

866
01:03:08,807 --> 01:03:10,764
Terminate her immediately.

867
01:03:13,936 --> 01:03:15,050
Stand by, Chewie.
Here we go.

868
01:03:15,187 --> 01:03:16,562
Cut in the sublight engines.

869
01:03:18,857 --> 01:03:20,481
What the...

870
01:03:21,567 --> 01:03:23,440
Arrghh arrgh!

871
01:03:23,569 --> 01:03:25,941
We've come out of hyperspace
into a meteor shower.

872
01:03:26,071 --> 01:03:27,269
Some kind of asteroid collision.

873
01:03:27,405 --> 01:03:28,318
It's not on any of the charts.

874
01:03:28,447 --> 01:03:29,692
What's going on?

875
01:03:29,824 --> 01:03:32,065
Our position's correct,
except no Alderaan.

876
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,445
What do you mean?
Where is it?

877
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:34,821
That's what I'm trying
to tell you, kid.

878
01:03:34,952 --> 01:03:36,327
It ain't there. It's
been totally blown away.

879
01:03:36,454 --> 01:03:37,367
What? How?

880
01:03:37,496 --> 01:03:39,120
Destroyed by the Empire.

881
01:03:39,247 --> 01:03:41,535
The entire starfleet couldn't destroy
the whole planet.

882
01:03:41,666 --> 01:03:42,994
It would take 1,000 ships
with more firepower than...

883
01:03:45,002 --> 01:03:46,793
There's another ship coming in.

884
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:47,869
Maybe they know what happened.

885
01:03:48,004 --> 01:03:49,202
It's an imperial fighter.

886
01:03:50,881 --> 01:03:51,960
It followed us!

887
01:03:52,090 --> 01:03:54,082
No. It's a short-range fighter.

888
01:03:54,217 --> 01:03:56,209
There aren't any bases around here.
Where did it come from?

889
01:03:59,471 --> 01:04:01,214
It sure is leaving in a big hurry.

890
01:04:01,348 --> 01:04:02,261
If they identify us,
we're in big trouble.

891
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:03,339
Not if I can help it.

892
01:04:03,474 --> 01:04:04,505
Chewie, jam its transmissions.

893
01:04:04,642 --> 01:04:05,507
It would be as well to let it go.

894
01:04:05,642 --> 01:04:06,555
It's too far out of range.

895
01:04:06,685 --> 01:04:07,883
Not for long.

896
01:04:10,813 --> 01:04:14,940
A fighter that size couldn't get
this deep into space on its own.

897
01:04:15,066 --> 01:04:17,687
He must have gotten lost,
been part of a convoy or something.

898
01:04:17,818 --> 01:04:19,442
Well, he ain't gonna
be around long enough...

899
01:04:19,570 --> 01:04:20,684
to tell anybody about us.

900
01:04:23,198 --> 01:04:24,989
Look at him.
He's heading for that small moon.

901
01:04:25,116 --> 01:04:27,737
I think I can get him before
he gets there. He's almost in range.

902
01:04:29,327 --> 01:04:31,319
That's no moon.

903
01:04:31,454 --> 01:04:32,912
It's a space station.

904
01:04:33,038 --> 01:04:34,829
It's too big to be a space station.

905
01:04:38,167 --> 01:04:40,574
I have a very bad feeling about this.

906
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:42,454
Turn the ship around.

907
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:44,745
Yeah. I think you're right.
Full reverse!

908
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,087
Chewie, lock in
the auxiliary power.

909
01:04:51,302 --> 01:04:53,757
Chewie, lock in
the auxiliary power!

910
01:04:56,139 --> 01:04:57,847
Why are we still
moving towards it!?

911
01:04:57,974 --> 01:04:59,765
We're caught in a tractor beam.
It's pulling us in!

912
01:04:59,892 --> 01:05:01,516
There's got to be
something you can do!

913
01:05:01,644 --> 01:05:03,019
There's nothing
I can do about it, kid.

914
01:05:03,145 --> 01:05:04,343
I'm at full power.
I'm gonna have to shut down.

915
01:05:04,479 --> 01:05:05,973
They're not gonna
get me without a fight.

916
01:05:10,525 --> 01:05:11,805
You can't win...

917
01:05:11,943 --> 01:05:14,065
but there are alternatives
to fighting.

918
01:05:30,666 --> 01:05:32,824
Clear Bay 327.

919
01:05:32,959 --> 01:05:35,284
We are opening
the magnetic field.

920
01:05:49,930 --> 01:05:51,128
To your stations!

921
01:05:51,265 --> 01:05:52,545
Come with me.

922
01:05:56,477 --> 01:05:58,019
<i>Close all outboard shields.</i>

923
01:05:58,145 --> 01:06:00,102
<i>Close all outboard shields.</i>

924
01:06:01,564 --> 01:06:02,595
Yes?

925
01:06:02,732 --> 01:06:04,142
<i>We've captured a freighter...</i>

926
01:06:04,275 --> 01:06:05,555
<i>entering the remains
of the Alderaan system.</i>

927
01:06:05,692 --> 01:06:07,400
<i>Its markings match
those of a ship...</i>

928
01:06:07,527 --> 01:06:09,934
<i>that blasted its way
out of Mos Eisley.</i>

929
01:06:10,071 --> 01:06:13,570
They must be trying to return
the stolen plans to the princess.

930
01:06:13,698 --> 01:06:16,615
She may yet be of some use to us.

931
01:06:21,371 --> 01:06:25,320
<i>Unlock 1, 5, 7, and 9.
Release charge.</i>

932
01:06:27,125 --> 01:06:29,164
<i>316, report to control.</i>

933
01:06:32,254 --> 01:06:34,211
There's no one on board, sir.

934
01:06:34,339 --> 01:06:37,043
According to the log, the crew
abandoned ship right after take-off.

935
01:06:37,175 --> 01:06:39,048
It must be a decoy, sir.

936
01:06:39,176 --> 01:06:40,634
Several of the escape pods
have been jettisoned.

937
01:06:40,761 --> 01:06:41,626
Did you find any droids?

938
01:06:41,761 --> 01:06:42,626
No, sir.

939
01:06:42,762 --> 01:06:44,671
If there were any on board,
they must also have jettisoned.

940
01:06:44,805 --> 01:06:46,299
Send a scanning crew aboard.

941
01:06:46,432 --> 01:06:48,223
I want every part
of this ship checked.

942
01:06:48,350 --> 01:06:49,299
Yes, sir.

943
01:06:49,434 --> 01:06:50,809
I sense something...

944
01:06:50,935 --> 01:06:53,888
a presence I've not felt since...

945
01:06:56,564 --> 01:06:58,106
Get me a scanning crew in here
on the double.

946
01:06:58,232 --> 01:06:59,940
I want every part
of this ship checked.

947
01:07:09,032 --> 01:07:10,989
There's no one here.

948
01:07:19,749 --> 01:07:21,622
Boy, it's lucky you had
these compartments.

949
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:23,160
I use them for smuggling.

950
01:07:23,293 --> 01:07:24,917
I never thought I'd
be smuggling myself in 'em.

951
01:07:25,044 --> 01:07:26,372
This is ridiculous.

952
01:07:26,504 --> 01:07:27,749
Even if I could take off...

953
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,255
I'd never get past
the tractor beam.

954
01:07:29,381 --> 01:07:30,791
Leave that to me.

955
01:07:30,924 --> 01:07:33,675
Damn fool, I knew
that you were gonna say that.

956
01:07:33,801 --> 01:07:35,081
Who's the more foolish...

957
01:07:35,219 --> 01:07:37,211
the fool or the fool
who follows him?

958
01:07:37,346 --> 01:07:38,804
Argh!

959
01:07:46,019 --> 01:07:47,394
The ship's all yours.

960
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,393
If the scanners pick up anything...

961
01:07:49,521 --> 01:07:51,394
report it immediately.

962
01:07:51,523 --> 01:07:53,314
All right, let's go.

963
01:08:08,286 --> 01:08:09,661
Hey, down there!

964
01:08:11,705 --> 01:08:13,744
Could you give us a hand
with this?

965
01:08:22,296 --> 01:08:25,249
TK-421, why aren't you
at your post?

966
01:08:25,382 --> 01:08:27,670
TK-421, do you copy?

967
01:08:39,935 --> 01:08:41,761
Take over.
We've got a bad transmitter.

968
01:08:41,895 --> 01:08:43,721
I'll see what I can do.

969
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:48,349
Grrr!

970
01:09:00,075 --> 01:09:03,075
Between his howling and your blasting
everything in sight...

971
01:09:03,203 --> 01:09:05,740
it's a wonder the whole station
doesn't know we're here.

972
01:09:05,871 --> 01:09:07,365
Bring them on!

973
01:09:07,498 --> 01:09:08,612
I'd prefer a straight fight
to all this sneakin' around.

974
01:09:08,749 --> 01:09:10,706
We've found the computer outlet, sir.

975
01:09:10,833 --> 01:09:13,584
Plug in. He should be able to interpret
the entire imperial network.

976
01:09:23,802 --> 01:09:26,471
He says he's found
the main controls...

977
01:09:26,595 --> 01:09:28,967
to the power beam that's
holding the ship here.

978
01:09:29,097 --> 01:09:31,219
He'll try to make the precise location
appear on the monitor.

979
01:09:31,349 --> 01:09:34,018
The tractor beam is coupled
to the main reactor...

980
01:09:34,143 --> 01:09:35,553
in seven locations.

981
01:09:35,686 --> 01:09:37,180
A power loss
at one of the terminals...

982
01:09:37,312 --> 01:09:39,849
will allow the ship to leave.

983
01:09:39,981 --> 01:09:42,815
I don't think you boys can help.

984
01:09:42,941 --> 01:09:44,649
I must go alone.

985
01:09:44,776 --> 01:09:46,353
Whatever you say.

986
01:09:46,486 --> 01:09:48,194
I've done more than I bargained for
on this trip already.

987
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:49,778
I want to go with you.

988
01:09:49,905 --> 01:09:52,146
Be patient, Luke.
Stay and watch over the droids.

989
01:09:52,282 --> 01:09:53,859
They must be delivered safely...

990
01:09:53,991 --> 01:09:56,991
or other star systems will suffer
the same fate as Alderaan.

991
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:01,163
Your destiny lies along
a different path from mine.

992
01:10:04,374 --> 01:10:08,157
The Force will be with you always.

993
01:10:15,570 --> 01:10:17,609
Argh argh argh!

994
01:10:17,739 --> 01:10:19,281
You said it, Chewie.

995
01:10:19,407 --> 01:10:22,822
Where did you dig up
that old fossil?

996
01:10:22,951 --> 01:10:24,824
Ben is a great man.

997
01:10:24,952 --> 01:10:27,442
Yeah, great at getting us
into trouble.

998
01:10:27,579 --> 01:10:28,907
I didn't hear you give any ideas.

999
01:10:29,039 --> 01:10:30,367
Well, anything's better
than just hangin' around...

1000
01:10:30,498 --> 01:10:31,660
waiting for 'em to pick us up.

1001
01:10:31,791 --> 01:10:32,656
Who do you think...

1002
01:10:33,959 --> 01:10:35,334
What is it?

1003
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:37,499
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

1004
01:10:37,629 --> 01:10:39,954
He says "I've found her"
and keeps repeating "She's here."

1005
01:10:40,089 --> 01:10:42,793
Well, who... who has he found?

1006
01:10:42,925 --> 01:10:43,838
Princess Leia.

1007
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:45,627
The princess?
She's here!?

1008
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:46,673
Princess?

1009
01:10:46,802 --> 01:10:48,047
Where? Where is she?

1010
01:10:48,179 --> 01:10:49,424
Princess? What's going on?

1011
01:10:54,183 --> 01:10:57,634
Level 5, Detention Block AA-23.

1012
01:11:01,772 --> 01:11:05,105
I'm afraid she's scheduled
to be terminated.

1013
01:11:05,233 --> 01:11:06,229
Oh, no!

1014
01:11:06,359 --> 01:11:07,734
We've got to do something!

1015
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:09,402
What are you talking about?

1016
01:11:09,528 --> 01:11:10,726
The droids belong to her.

1017
01:11:10,862 --> 01:11:11,727
She's the one in the message.

1018
01:11:11,863 --> 01:11:12,977
We got to help her.

1019
01:11:13,114 --> 01:11:14,312
Now look, don't get
any funny ideas.

1020
01:11:14,449 --> 01:11:15,563
The old man wants us
to wait right here.

1021
01:11:15,699 --> 01:11:17,074
But he didn't know
she was here.

1022
01:11:17,201 --> 01:11:19,277
Just find a way back into that
detention block.

1023
01:11:19,411 --> 01:11:20,360
I'm not going anywhere.

1024
01:11:20,495 --> 01:11:21,574
They're going to execute her.

1025
01:11:21,704 --> 01:11:23,162
Look, a few minutes ago, you said...

1026
01:11:23,289 --> 01:11:24,238
you didn't want to just wait here
to be captured.

1027
01:11:24,373 --> 01:11:25,369
Now all you want to do is stay?

1028
01:11:25,499 --> 01:11:27,159
Marching into the detention area...

1029
01:11:27,292 --> 01:11:28,406
is not what I had in mind.

1030
01:11:28,543 --> 01:11:29,574
But they're gonna kill her!

1031
01:11:29,710 --> 01:11:31,334
Better her than me.

1032
01:11:39,176 --> 01:11:40,421
She's rich.

1033
01:11:40,552 --> 01:11:42,959
Argh!

1034
01:11:43,095 --> 01:11:44,257
Rich?

1035
01:11:44,388 --> 01:11:45,965
Mm-hmm. Rich, powerful.

1036
01:11:46,098 --> 01:11:49,098
Listen, if you were to rescue her,
the reward would be...

1037
01:11:49,225 --> 01:11:50,387
What?

1038
01:11:50,518 --> 01:11:51,928
Well, more well
than you can imagine.

1039
01:11:52,061 --> 01:11:54,433
I don't know.
I can imagine quite a bit.

1040
01:11:54,562 --> 01:11:55,593
You'll get it.

1041
01:11:55,730 --> 01:11:56,761
I better.

1042
01:11:56,898 --> 01:11:58,308
You will.

1043
01:11:58,440 --> 01:11:59,934
All right, kid.
You better be right about this.

1044
01:12:00,067 --> 01:12:01,098
All right.

1045
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:02,099
What's your plan?

1046
01:12:02,235 --> 01:12:03,515
Um...

1047
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:07,187
3PO, hand me those binders there,
will you?

1048
01:12:07,322 --> 01:12:09,279
OK

1049
01:12:09,407 --> 01:12:11,529
Now... I'm gonna
put these on you.

1050
01:12:11,659 --> 01:12:12,655
Grrr!

1051
01:12:12,785 --> 01:12:16,698
OK Han, you... you put those on.

1052
01:12:16,829 --> 01:12:17,908
Don't worry, Chewie.

1053
01:12:18,039 --> 01:12:19,497
I think I know
what he has in mind.

1054
01:12:19,623 --> 01:12:22,409
Master Luke, sir,
pardon me for asking...

1055
01:12:22,542 --> 01:12:25,293
but what should R2 and I do
if we're discovered here?

1056
01:12:25,461 --> 01:12:26,919
Lock the door.

1057
01:12:27,046 --> 01:12:29,252
And hope they don't have blasters.

1058
01:12:29,381 --> 01:12:31,089
That isn't very reassuring.

1059
01:12:36,845 --> 01:12:37,876
Grrr!

1060
01:12:51,606 --> 01:12:52,981
<i>517 to scanner control.</i>

1061
01:12:53,107 --> 01:12:56,392
<i>517 to scanner control.</i>

1062
01:12:59,946 --> 01:13:01,985
<i>316, report to control.</i>

1063
01:13:05,283 --> 01:13:07,820
<i>53 to upper bay door.</i>

1064
01:13:07,952 --> 01:13:10,573
<i>53 to upper bay door.</i>

1065
01:13:22,588 --> 01:13:24,829
I can't see a thing
in this helmet.

1066
01:13:55,071 --> 01:13:57,692
This is not gonna work.

1067
01:13:57,823 --> 01:13:58,937
Why didn't you say so before?

1068
01:13:59,074 --> 01:14:01,031
I did say so before.

1069
01:14:16,087 --> 01:14:19,420
Where are you taking this... thing?

1070
01:14:19,548 --> 01:14:22,252
Prisoner transfer
from Cell Block 1138.

1071
01:14:22,383 --> 01:14:24,873
I wasn't notified.

1072
01:14:25,010 --> 01:14:27,132
I'll have to clear it.

1073
01:14:32,266 --> 01:14:33,464
Argh!

1074
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:34,880
Look out! He's loose!

1075
01:14:35,018 --> 01:14:35,883
He'll tear us all apart!

1076
01:14:36,019 --> 01:14:37,299
I'll get him!

1077
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:01,575
Look out!

1078
01:15:07,835 --> 01:15:08,700
Arrgh!

1079
01:15:11,921 --> 01:15:14,376
We gotta find out which cell
this princess of yours is in.

1080
01:15:14,507 --> 01:15:15,882
Here it is... 2187.

1081
01:15:16,008 --> 01:15:18,545
You go and get her.
I'll hold them here.

1082
01:15:21,512 --> 01:15:23,884
Uh... Uh, everything's
under control.

1083
01:15:24,014 --> 01:15:25,212
Situation normal.

1084
01:15:25,348 --> 01:15:26,546
What happened?

1085
01:15:26,682 --> 01:15:29,054
Had a slight weapons malfunction...

1086
01:15:29,184 --> 01:15:31,390
but, uh, everything's
perfectly all right now.

1087
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:34,271
We're fine... We're all fine
here now. Thank you.

1088
01:15:34,397 --> 01:15:35,559
How are you?

1089
01:15:35,689 --> 01:15:37,562
We're sending a squad up.

1090
01:15:37,691 --> 01:15:39,066
Uh, negative, negative!

1091
01:15:39,192 --> 01:15:41,765
We have a... a reactor leak
here, uh, now.

1092
01:15:41,902 --> 01:15:42,933
Give us a few minutes
to lock it down.

1093
01:15:43,070 --> 01:15:44,896
Uh, large leak, very dangerous.

1094
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:47,734
Who is this? What's your
operating number?

1095
01:15:47,865 --> 01:15:48,979
Uh...

1096
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,362
Boring conversation anyway.

1097
01:15:51,493 --> 01:15:54,327
Luke! We're gonna have company!

1098
01:16:07,714 --> 01:16:10,204
Aren't you a little short
for a stormtrooper?

1099
01:16:10,341 --> 01:16:11,206
Huh?

1100
01:16:11,342 --> 01:16:12,884
Oh, the uniform.

1101
01:16:14,594 --> 01:16:16,586
I'm Luke Skywalker.
I'm here to rescue you.

1102
01:16:16,721 --> 01:16:18,131
You're who?

1103
01:16:18,263 --> 01:16:19,377
I'm here to rescue you.
I've got your R2 unit.

1104
01:16:19,514 --> 01:16:20,593
I'm here with Ben Kenobi.

1105
01:16:20,724 --> 01:16:21,886
Ben Kenobi!?
Where is he?

1106
01:16:22,016 --> 01:16:22,965
Come on!

1107
01:16:24,852 --> 01:16:26,180
He is here.

1108
01:16:26,311 --> 01:16:28,636
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

1109
01:16:28,771 --> 01:16:29,969
What makes you think so?

1110
01:16:30,106 --> 01:16:32,643
A tremor in the Force.

1111
01:16:32,775 --> 01:16:33,889
The last time I felt it...

1112
01:16:34,025 --> 01:16:36,147
was in the presence
of my old master.

1113
01:16:36,277 --> 01:16:38,732
Surely he must be dead by now.

1114
01:16:38,863 --> 01:16:41,697
Don't underestimate the Force.

1115
01:16:41,823 --> 01:16:43,696
The Jedi are extinct.

1116
01:16:43,825 --> 01:16:46,031
Their fire has gone out of the universe.

1117
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:49,575
You, my friend, are all that's left
of their religion.

1118
01:16:49,704 --> 01:16:51,198
Yes.

1119
01:16:51,330 --> 01:16:52,326
We have an emergency alert...

1120
01:16:52,456 --> 01:16:55,077
in Detention Block AA-23.

1121
01:16:55,208 --> 01:16:56,322
The princess?

1122
01:16:56,459 --> 01:16:57,739
Put all sections on alert.

1123
01:16:57,877 --> 01:16:59,335
Obi-Wan is here.

1124
01:16:59,462 --> 01:17:01,454
The Force is with him.

1125
01:17:01,588 --> 01:17:02,619
If you're right...

1126
01:17:02,756 --> 01:17:04,629
he must not be
allowed to escape.

1127
01:17:04,757 --> 01:17:06,251
Escape is not his plan.

1128
01:17:06,383 --> 01:17:08,043
I must face him alone.

1129
01:17:14,515 --> 01:17:16,673
Argh!

1130
01:17:16,808 --> 01:17:18,884
Get behind me!
Get behind me!

1131
01:17:30,318 --> 01:17:31,397
Watch your left.

1132
01:17:31,528 --> 01:17:33,070
They went down the cell bay.

1133
01:17:35,614 --> 01:17:37,191
Can't get out that way.

1134
01:17:37,324 --> 01:17:38,901
Looks like you managed to cut off
our only escape route.

1135
01:17:39,033 --> 01:17:43,361
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell,
Your Highness.

1136
01:17:43,495 --> 01:17:44,870
C-3PO, C-3PO!

1137
01:17:44,996 --> 01:17:46,241
Yes, sir?

1138
01:17:46,372 --> 01:17:48,080
Are there any other ways
out of the cell bay?

1139
01:17:48,207 --> 01:17:49,915
We've been cut off!

1140
01:17:52,127 --> 01:17:54,333
What was that?
I didn't copy.

1141
01:17:54,462 --> 01:17:57,795
I said all systems have been alerted
to your presence, sir.

1142
01:17:57,923 --> 01:17:59,714
The main entrance seems
to be the only way in or out.

1143
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:02,794
All other information
on your level is restricted.

1144
01:18:02,927 --> 01:18:04,421
Open up in there!

1145
01:18:04,553 --> 01:18:06,379
Open up in there!

1146
01:18:06,513 --> 01:18:08,173
Oh, no!

1147
01:18:08,306 --> 01:18:09,848
There isn't any other way out!

1148
01:18:12,017 --> 01:18:13,808
Argh!

1149
01:18:15,478 --> 01:18:17,684
I can't hold them off forever!
Now what!?

1150
01:18:17,813 --> 01:18:19,521
This is some rescue!

1151
01:18:19,648 --> 01:18:21,308
You came in here, and you didn't
have a plan for getting out?

1152
01:18:21,441 --> 01:18:23,398
He's the brains, sweetheart!

1153
01:18:23,526 --> 01:18:24,688
Well, I didn't...

1154
01:18:26,361 --> 01:18:27,357
What the hell are you doing?

1155
01:18:27,487 --> 01:18:29,812
Somebody has to save our skins.

1156
01:18:32,157 --> 01:18:33,817
Into the garbage chute, fly boy.

1157
01:18:40,705 --> 01:18:42,365
- Get in there!
- Arrgh!

1158
01:18:42,498 --> 01:18:45,332
Get in there, you big furry oaf!

1159
01:18:45,459 --> 01:18:46,621
I don't care what you smell.

1160
01:18:46,752 --> 01:18:49,538
Get in there, and
don't worry about it.

1161
01:18:52,214 --> 01:18:53,672
Wonderful girl!

1162
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:56,713
Either I'm going to kill her...

1163
01:18:56,843 --> 01:18:59,001
or I'm beginning to like her.

1164
01:19:00,554 --> 01:19:03,258
Get in there!

1165
01:19:06,225 --> 01:19:08,264
Aah!

1166
01:19:10,103 --> 01:19:11,182
Ah!

1167
01:19:11,312 --> 01:19:12,806
Argh!

1168
01:19:14,690 --> 01:19:17,441
The garbage chute was
a really wonderful idea.

1169
01:19:17,567 --> 01:19:21,066
What an incredible smell
you've discovered!

1170
01:19:23,696 --> 01:19:25,937
Let's get out of here.

1171
01:19:26,073 --> 01:19:27,318
Get away from there.

1172
01:19:27,449 --> 01:19:28,398
No, wait!

1173
01:19:35,164 --> 01:19:36,077
Will you forget it!?
I already tried it!

1174
01:19:36,206 --> 01:19:37,700
It's magnetically sealed.

1175
01:19:37,832 --> 01:19:39,871
Put that thing away!
You're gonna get us all killed!

1176
01:19:40,001 --> 01:19:41,910
Absolutely, Your Worship.

1177
01:19:42,044 --> 01:19:44,332
Look, I had everything under control
till you led us down here!

1178
01:19:44,462 --> 01:19:45,956
Ya know, it's not
gonna take 'em long...

1179
01:19:46,089 --> 01:19:47,583
to figure out
what happened to us!

1180
01:19:47,715 --> 01:19:49,588
It could be worse.

1181
01:19:49,716 --> 01:19:50,665
Woorr!

1182
01:19:53,344 --> 01:19:54,589
It's worse.

1183
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:56,214
There's something alive in here.

1184
01:19:56,346 --> 01:19:57,721
That's your imagination.

1185
01:19:57,848 --> 01:20:00,634
Something just moved past my leg.

1186
01:20:02,351 --> 01:20:04,390
Look! Did you see that?

1187
01:20:04,519 --> 01:20:05,384
What?

1188
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:07,228
Grrr!

1189
01:20:25,744 --> 01:20:26,609
Woorr!

1190
01:20:26,745 --> 01:20:27,610
Kid!

1191
01:20:27,745 --> 01:20:28,610
Luke!

1192
01:20:28,746 --> 01:20:30,156
Luke!

1193
01:20:30,289 --> 01:20:31,238
Luke!

1194
01:20:32,457 --> 01:20:33,571
Luke!

1195
01:20:37,294 --> 01:20:38,290
Aah!

1196
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:39,369
Woorr!

1197
01:20:39,504 --> 01:20:43,003
Luke! Luke, grab hold of this!

1198
01:20:43,132 --> 01:20:45,539
Blast it!
My gun's jammed.

1199
01:20:45,676 --> 01:20:47,300
Where?

1200
01:20:47,427 --> 01:20:48,376
Anywhere!

1201
01:20:56,267 --> 01:20:57,263
Luke, Luke!

1202
01:21:20,994 --> 01:21:22,618
Help him!

1203
01:21:22,746 --> 01:21:23,825
What happened?

1204
01:21:23,955 --> 01:21:25,034
I don't know.

1205
01:21:25,164 --> 01:21:27,370
It just let go of me
and disappeared.

1206
01:21:33,671 --> 01:21:37,371
I got a bad feeling about this.

1207
01:21:37,507 --> 01:21:39,713
Grrr!

1208
01:21:41,843 --> 01:21:42,708
The walls are moving!

1209
01:21:42,844 --> 01:21:44,124
Don't just stand there!

1210
01:21:44,262 --> 01:21:46,717
Try and brace it with something.

1211
01:21:51,851 --> 01:21:53,808
Grrr!

1212
01:21:53,936 --> 01:21:55,394
Help me!

1213
01:22:08,072 --> 01:22:09,103
Wait a minute!

1214
01:22:11,908 --> 01:22:13,568
3PO!

1215
01:22:13,701 --> 01:22:16,026
Come in, 3PO!

1216
01:22:16,161 --> 01:22:17,655
3PO!

1217
01:22:17,788 --> 01:22:19,614
Where could he be?

1218
01:22:24,334 --> 01:22:26,291
Take over. See to him.

1219
01:22:28,629 --> 01:22:30,787
Look, there.

1220
01:22:32,174 --> 01:22:33,549
They're madmen.

1221
01:22:33,675 --> 01:22:34,920
They're heading for the prison level.

1222
01:22:35,051 --> 01:22:36,545
If you hurry, you might catch them.

1223
01:22:36,677 --> 01:22:38,135
Follow me.

1224
01:22:42,265 --> 01:22:44,304
You stand guard.

1225
01:22:48,186 --> 01:22:49,644
Come on.

1226
01:22:53,356 --> 01:22:54,814
Oh!

1227
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:01,728
All this excitement has overrun
the circuits in my counterpart here.

1228
01:23:01,863 --> 01:23:05,278
If you don't mind, I'd like to take him
down to maintenance.

1229
01:23:05,407 --> 01:23:06,865
All right.

1230
01:23:18,834 --> 01:23:19,699
3PO!

1231
01:23:19,835 --> 01:23:21,163
Come in, 3PO!

1232
01:23:21,294 --> 01:23:22,704
3PO!

1233
01:23:22,837 --> 01:23:24,212
Get on top!

1234
01:23:24,338 --> 01:23:25,452
I can't.

1235
01:23:25,589 --> 01:23:28,459
Where could he be!? 3PO!

1236
01:23:28,592 --> 01:23:30,631
3PO, will you come in!

1237
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:32,135
They aren't here.

1238
01:23:32,261 --> 01:23:33,459
Something must have
happened to them.

1239
01:23:33,595 --> 01:23:34,970
See if they've been captured.

1240
01:23:35,096 --> 01:23:36,092
Hurry.

1241
01:23:39,558 --> 01:23:41,135
One thing's for sure...

1242
01:23:41,268 --> 01:23:42,678
we're all gonna be a lot thinner.

1243
01:23:45,438 --> 01:23:47,430
Get on top of it.

1244
01:23:47,564 --> 01:23:48,643
I'm trying.

1245
01:23:53,611 --> 01:23:55,437
Thank goodness they haven't found them.

1246
01:23:55,570 --> 01:23:56,566
Where could they be?

1247
01:23:59,115 --> 01:24:00,657
"Use the comlink"?

1248
01:24:00,783 --> 01:24:03,452
Oh, my. I forgot.
I turned it off.

1249
01:24:06,204 --> 01:24:08,777
Are you there, sir?

1250
01:24:08,914 --> 01:24:10,657
3PO!

1251
01:24:10,790 --> 01:24:11,821
We've had some problems.

1252
01:24:11,958 --> 01:24:13,072
Will you shut up
and listen to me!?

1253
01:24:13,209 --> 01:24:15,000
Shut down all
the garbage mashers...

1254
01:24:15,127 --> 01:24:16,040
on the detention level, will ya!?

1255
01:24:16,169 --> 01:24:17,793
Do you copy!?

1256
01:24:17,921 --> 01:24:21,336
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!

1257
01:24:21,465 --> 01:24:24,002
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!

1258
01:24:24,134 --> 01:24:25,842
No! Shut them all down. Hurry!

1259
01:24:38,311 --> 01:24:39,224
What?

1260
01:24:39,354 --> 01:24:40,848
Ha ha!

1261
01:24:42,982 --> 01:24:45,058
Listen to them.
They're dying, R2!

1262
01:24:45,192 --> 01:24:46,769
Curse my metal body!

1263
01:24:46,901 --> 01:24:50,767
I wasn't fast enough.
It's all my fault! My poor master.

1264
01:24:50,904 --> 01:24:52,446
We're all right! You did great!

1265
01:24:52,572 --> 01:24:54,979
Hey! Open the pressure
maintenance hatch...

1266
01:24:55,116 --> 01:24:57,238
on unit number...
Where are we?

1267
01:24:57,368 --> 01:25:00,701
3263827!

1268
01:25:45,071 --> 01:25:48,071
If we can just avoid
any more female advice...

1269
01:25:48,198 --> 01:25:50,404
we ought to be able
to get outta here.

1270
01:25:50,533 --> 01:25:51,991
Well, let's get moving.

1271
01:25:52,118 --> 01:25:53,067
Grrr!

1272
01:25:53,202 --> 01:25:55,075
Where are you going?

1273
01:25:55,203 --> 01:25:56,234
Aw...

1274
01:25:56,371 --> 01:25:57,781
No, wait! They'll hear!

1275
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:00,866
Come here, you big coward.

1276
01:26:00,999 --> 01:26:01,948
Chewie, come here.

1277
01:26:02,084 --> 01:26:03,412
Listen...

1278
01:26:03,543 --> 01:26:06,116
I don't know who you are
or where you came from...

1279
01:26:06,253 --> 01:26:09,170
but from now on, you do
as I tell you, OK?

1280
01:26:09,297 --> 01:26:11,206
Look, Your Worshipfulness...

1281
01:26:11,341 --> 01:26:13,214
let's get one thing straight.

1282
01:26:13,342 --> 01:26:16,128
I take orders from
just one person... me.

1283
01:26:16,261 --> 01:26:18,253
It's a wonder you're still alive.

1284
01:26:18,388 --> 01:26:21,637
Will somebody get this big
walking carpet out of my way?

1285
01:26:21,765 --> 01:26:24,884
No reward is worth this.

1286
01:26:33,983 --> 01:26:36,141
Give me regular reports, please.

1287
01:26:36,276 --> 01:26:37,355
Right.

1288
01:26:39,570 --> 01:26:40,945
Do you know what's going on?

1289
01:26:41,072 --> 01:26:42,815
Maybe it's another drill.

1290
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:49,487
You seen that new VT-16?

1291
01:26:49,620 --> 01:26:51,945
Yeah. Some of the other guys
were telling me about it.

1292
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:54,156
They say it's... it's quite a thing to see...

1293
01:26:54,290 --> 01:26:56,366
What was that?

1294
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:58,042
Ah, it's nothing. Outgassing.

1295
01:26:58,168 --> 01:26:59,117
Don't worry about it.

1296
01:27:04,673 --> 01:27:05,538
There she is.

1297
01:27:05,674 --> 01:27:06,872
C-3PO? Do you copy?

1298
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:07,957
Yes, sir.

1299
01:27:08,092 --> 01:27:10,001
- Are you safe?
- For the moment.

1300
01:27:10,135 --> 01:27:12,423
We're in the main hangar
across from the ship.

1301
01:27:14,472 --> 01:27:16,049
We're right above you.
Stand by.

1302
01:27:16,182 --> 01:27:17,842
You came in that thing?

1303
01:27:17,975 --> 01:27:19,006
You're braver than I thought.

1304
01:27:19,142 --> 01:27:20,422
Nice! Come on.

1305
01:27:24,605 --> 01:27:25,470
It's them!

1306
01:27:25,606 --> 01:27:26,555
Blast them!

1307
01:27:27,690 --> 01:27:28,686
Get back to the ship!

1308
01:27:28,816 --> 01:27:30,226
Where are you going?
Come back!

1309
01:27:30,359 --> 01:27:31,355
He certainly has courage.

1310
01:27:31,485 --> 01:27:32,813
What good will it do us...

1311
01:27:32,944 --> 01:27:35,102
if he gets himself killed?
Come on.

1312
01:27:35,238 --> 01:27:38,820
Aah!

1313
01:27:40,325 --> 01:27:42,566
Aah!

1314
01:27:58,839 --> 01:27:59,953
Whoop!

1315
01:28:00,090 --> 01:28:02,711
I think we took a wrong turn.

1316
01:28:07,012 --> 01:28:07,961
There's no lock.

1317
01:28:12,016 --> 01:28:13,261
That oughta hold them
for a while.

1318
01:28:13,392 --> 01:28:14,850
Quick! We've got to get across.

1319
01:28:14,976 --> 01:28:16,684
Find the controls
that extend the bridge.

1320
01:28:16,811 --> 01:28:18,186
I think I just blasted it.

1321
01:28:18,312 --> 01:28:20,103
They're coming through!

1322
01:28:42,456 --> 01:28:43,452
Here, hold this.

1323
01:29:00,344 --> 01:29:01,458
Here they come.

1324
01:29:11,645 --> 01:29:13,436
For luck.

1325
01:29:19,317 --> 01:29:22,234
We think they may be splitting up.

1326
01:29:22,361 --> 01:29:25,610
They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir.

1327
01:29:39,166 --> 01:29:40,245
Where could they be?

1328
01:29:45,129 --> 01:29:47,002
Close the blast doors!

1329
01:29:54,386 --> 01:29:56,592
Open the blast doors!
Open the blast doors!

1330
01:30:14,985 --> 01:30:17,357
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.

1331
01:30:17,487 --> 01:30:18,981
We meet again at last.

1332
01:30:19,113 --> 01:30:22,197
The circle is now complete.

1333
01:30:22,324 --> 01:30:24,779
When I left you,
I was but the learner.

1334
01:30:24,909 --> 01:30:26,948
Now I am the master.

1335
01:30:27,077 --> 01:30:29,994
Only a master of evil, Darth.

1336
01:30:49,386 --> 01:30:51,627
Your powers are weak, old man.

1337
01:30:51,763 --> 01:30:53,340
You can't win, Darth.

1338
01:30:53,472 --> 01:30:55,429
If you strike me down...

1339
01:30:55,557 --> 01:30:58,890
I shall become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine.

1340
01:31:05,607 --> 01:31:08,358
You should not have come back.

1341
01:31:34,128 --> 01:31:36,797
Didn't we just leave this party?

1342
01:31:38,548 --> 01:31:39,579
What kept you?

1343
01:31:39,716 --> 01:31:40,629
We, uh, ran into some old friends.

1344
01:31:40,758 --> 01:31:41,789
The ship all right?

1345
01:31:41,926 --> 01:31:43,634
It seems OK,
if we can get to it.

1346
01:31:43,761 --> 01:31:45,552
I just hope the old man got
the tractor beam out of commission.

1347
01:32:00,065 --> 01:32:01,263
Look!

1348
01:32:04,902 --> 01:32:06,728
Come on, R2, we're going.

1349
01:32:08,613 --> 01:32:09,644
Now's our chance! Go!

1350
01:32:13,533 --> 01:32:14,482
Ben?

1351
01:32:30,046 --> 01:32:31,754
No!

1352
01:32:39,845 --> 01:32:40,710
Come on!

1353
01:32:40,846 --> 01:32:41,960
Come on!

1354
01:32:42,097 --> 01:32:43,555
Come on!

1355
01:32:43,681 --> 01:32:44,795
Luke, it's too late!

1356
01:32:44,932 --> 01:32:46,675
Blast the door, kid!

1357
01:32:56,441 --> 01:32:58,682
• Run, Luke, run! •

1358
01:33:00,819 --> 01:33:03,653
I hope that old man got that
tractor beam out of commission...

1359
01:33:03,780 --> 01:33:06,353
or this is gonna be a real short trip.
OK Hit it!

1360
01:33:16,832 --> 01:33:18,705
Aargh!

1361
01:33:36,930 --> 01:33:39,088
We're coming up
on their sentry ships.

1362
01:33:39,224 --> 01:33:40,884
Hold them off.

1363
01:33:41,017 --> 01:33:44,681
Angle the deflector shields
while I charge up the main guns.

1364
01:33:52,275 --> 01:33:54,730
I can't believe he's gone.

1365
01:33:57,404 --> 01:33:59,859
There wasn't anything
you could have done.

1366
01:33:59,990 --> 01:34:02,860
Come on, buddy.
We're not out of this yet.

1367
01:34:19,046 --> 01:34:22,046
You in, kid?
OK, stay sharp.

1368
01:34:32,931 --> 01:34:34,045
Here they come.

1369
01:34:52,071 --> 01:34:53,897
They're coming in too fast!

1370
01:35:01,912 --> 01:35:03,370
We've lost the lateral controls!

1371
01:35:03,496 --> 01:35:05,737
Don't worry.
She'll hold together.

1372
01:35:07,291 --> 01:35:09,248
Hear me, baby?
Hold together.

1373
01:35:26,305 --> 01:35:27,254
Ha ha!

1374
01:35:31,434 --> 01:35:32,976
Got him! I got him!

1375
01:35:33,102 --> 01:35:35,343
Great, kid!
Don't get cocky.

1376
01:35:36,772 --> 01:35:38,396
There's still two more
of them out there!

1377
01:36:12,299 --> 01:36:13,709
That's it! We did it!

1378
01:36:13,842 --> 01:36:15,964
We did it!

1379
01:36:16,093 --> 01:36:18,548
Help! I think I'm melting!
This is all your fault!

1380
01:36:26,518 --> 01:36:27,893
Are they away?

1381
01:36:28,019 --> 01:36:31,055
They've just made the jump
into hyperspace.

1382
01:36:31,188 --> 01:36:35,516
You're sure the homing beacon
is secure aboard their ship?

1383
01:36:35,650 --> 01:36:38,319
I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.

1384
01:36:38,444 --> 01:36:40,187
This had better work.

1385
01:36:40,403 --> 01:36:43,072
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?

1386
01:36:43,197 --> 01:36:46,281
You know, sometimes
I amaze even myself.

1387
01:36:46,408 --> 01:36:48,649
That doesn't sound too hard.

1388
01:36:48,785 --> 01:36:50,065
They let us go.

1389
01:36:50,203 --> 01:36:51,448
It's the only explanation...

1390
01:36:51,579 --> 01:36:53,121
for the ease of our escape.

1391
01:36:53,247 --> 01:36:54,326
Easy? You call that easy?

1392
01:36:54,456 --> 01:36:55,405
They're tracking us.

1393
01:36:55,540 --> 01:36:57,200
Not this ship, sister.

1394
01:36:57,333 --> 01:37:00,997
At least the information
in R2 is still intact.

1395
01:37:01,128 --> 01:37:02,752
What's so important?
What's he carrying?

1396
01:37:02,879 --> 01:37:05,749
The technical readouts
of that battle station.

1397
01:37:05,881 --> 01:37:08,418
I only hope that
when the data's analysed...

1398
01:37:08,550 --> 01:37:10,127
a weakness can be found.

1399
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:11,754
It's not over yet.

1400
01:37:11,886 --> 01:37:13,594
It is for me, sister.

1401
01:37:13,721 --> 01:37:15,429
Look, I ain't in this
for your revolution...

1402
01:37:15,555 --> 01:37:17,381
and I'm not in it for you, Princess.

1403
01:37:17,515 --> 01:37:18,713
I expect to be well paid.

1404
01:37:18,849 --> 01:37:20,011
I'm in it for the money.

1405
01:37:20,142 --> 01:37:22,099
You needn't worry
about your reward.

1406
01:37:22,227 --> 01:37:23,804
If money is all that you love...

1407
01:37:23,937 --> 01:37:26,392
then that's what you'll receive.

1408
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:30,349
Your friend is quite a mercenary.

1409
01:37:30,483 --> 01:37:32,689
I wonder if he really cares
about anything...

1410
01:37:32,818 --> 01:37:34,312
or anybody.

1411
01:37:34,445 --> 01:37:35,903
I care.

1412
01:37:42,451 --> 01:37:44,941
So...

1413
01:37:45,078 --> 01:37:46,572
what do you think of her, Han?

1414
01:37:46,704 --> 01:37:48,530
I'm trying not to, kid.

1415
01:37:48,664 --> 01:37:50,703
Good.

1416
01:37:54,085 --> 01:37:57,038
Still, she's got a lot of spirit.

1417
01:37:59,172 --> 01:38:00,547
I don't know.
What do you think?

1418
01:38:00,673 --> 01:38:02,167
You think a princess
and a guy like me...

1419
01:38:02,299 --> 01:38:04,042
No!

1420
01:38:50,294 --> 01:38:51,243
You're safe.

1421
01:38:51,378 --> 01:38:52,623
When we heard about Alderaan...

1422
01:38:52,754 --> 01:38:53,916
we feared the worst.

1423
01:38:54,047 --> 01:38:55,707
We have no time
for sorrows, Commander.

1424
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:57,631
You must use the information
in this R2 unit...

1425
01:38:57,758 --> 01:38:58,671
to help plan the attack.

1426
01:38:58,801 --> 01:39:00,259
It's our only hope.

1427
01:39:22,068 --> 01:39:23,313
Yes.

1428
01:39:23,444 --> 01:39:24,854
We're approaching the planet Yavin.

1429
01:39:24,987 --> 01:39:26,860
The rebel base is on a moon
on the far side.

1430
01:39:26,989 --> 01:39:29,526
We are preparing
to orbit the planet.

1431
01:39:38,206 --> 01:39:40,245
The battle station
is heavily shielded...

1432
01:39:40,374 --> 01:39:42,165
and carries a firepower...

1433
01:39:42,292 --> 01:39:44,201
greater than half the starfleet.

1434
01:39:44,335 --> 01:39:48,628
Its defences are designed around
a direct large-scale assault.

1435
01:39:48,755 --> 01:39:53,996
A small, one-man fighter should be able
to penetrate the outer defence.

1436
01:39:54,134 --> 01:39:56,340
Pardon me for asking, sir...

1437
01:39:56,470 --> 01:39:59,340
but what good are snub fighters
going to be against that?

1438
01:39:59,472 --> 01:40:02,971
The Empire doesn't consider
a small, one-man fighter...

1439
01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:04,096
to be any threat...

1440
01:40:04,225 --> 01:40:06,976
or they'd have a tighter defence.

1441
01:40:07,103 --> 01:40:10,139
An analysis of the plans
provided by Princess Leia...

1442
01:40:10,272 --> 01:40:13,521
has demonstrated a weakness
in the battle station.

1443
01:40:13,649 --> 01:40:16,353
The approach will not be easy.

1444
01:40:16,485 --> 01:40:19,604
You're required to manoeuvre
straight down this trench...

1445
01:40:19,737 --> 01:40:23,070
and skim the surface
to this point.

1446
01:40:23,198 --> 01:40:25,902
The target area
is only 2 metres wide.

1447
01:40:26,034 --> 01:40:28,156
It's a small thermal exhaust port...

1448
01:40:28,286 --> 01:40:30,776
right below the main port.

1449
01:40:30,913 --> 01:40:34,032
The shaft leads directly
to the reactor system.

1450
01:40:34,165 --> 01:40:36,786
A precise hit will start
a chain reaction...

1451
01:40:36,917 --> 01:40:39,123
which should destroy the station.

1452
01:40:39,252 --> 01:40:42,834
Only a precise hit will
set up a chain reaction.

1453
01:40:42,963 --> 01:40:44,243
The shaft is ray-shielded...

1454
01:40:44,381 --> 01:40:46,089
so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.

1455
01:40:46,216 --> 01:40:48,671
That's impossible,
even for a computer.

1456
01:40:48,801 --> 01:40:52,216
It's not impossible. I used to bull's-eye
womp rats in my T-16 back home.

1457
01:40:52,346 --> 01:40:54,718
They're not much bigger
than 2 metres.

1458
01:40:54,847 --> 01:40:58,215
Then man your ships,
and may the Force be with you.

1459
01:41:06,273 --> 01:41:08,728
<i>Orbiting the planet
at maximum velocity.</i>

1460
01:41:08,858 --> 01:41:10,767
<i>The moon with the rebel base...</i>

1461
01:41:10,901 --> 01:41:13,189
<i>will be in range in 30 minutes.</i>

1462
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:15,608
This will be a day long remembered.

1463
01:41:15,738 --> 01:41:18,145
It has seen the end of Kenobi...

1464
01:41:18,282 --> 01:41:22,824
and will soon see the end
of the rebellion.

1465
01:41:26,371 --> 01:41:29,704
All flight crews, man your stations.

1466
01:41:29,832 --> 01:41:32,702
All flight crews, man your stations.

1467
01:41:35,128 --> 01:41:38,212
So... you got your reward
and you're just leaving, then?

1468
01:41:38,339 --> 01:41:39,797
That's right. Yeah.

1469
01:41:39,923 --> 01:41:43,623
I got some old debts I got
to pay off with this stuff.

1470
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:45,468
And even if I didn't...

1471
01:41:45,594 --> 01:41:48,215
you don't think I'd be fool enough
to stick around here, do ya?

1472
01:41:48,347 --> 01:41:49,971
Why don't you come with us?

1473
01:41:50,098 --> 01:41:51,924
You're pretty good in a fight.
We could use ya.

1474
01:41:52,058 --> 01:41:54,928
Come on. Why don't you
take a look around?

1475
01:41:55,060 --> 01:41:56,340
You know what's about to happen...

1476
01:41:56,478 --> 01:41:57,758
what they're up against.

1477
01:41:57,895 --> 01:41:59,057
They could use
a good pilot like you.

1478
01:41:59,188 --> 01:42:00,646
You're turning
your back on them.

1479
01:42:00,773 --> 01:42:03,145
What good's a reward
if you ain't around to use it?

1480
01:42:03,275 --> 01:42:05,148
Besides, attacking
that battle station...

1481
01:42:05,276 --> 01:42:06,307
ain't my idea of courage.

1482
01:42:06,444 --> 01:42:09,230
It's more like... suicide.

1483
01:42:10,614 --> 01:42:11,527
All right.

1484
01:42:11,656 --> 01:42:13,897
Take care of yourself, Han.

1485
01:42:14,033 --> 01:42:16,570
I guess that's what
you're best at, isn't it?

1486
01:42:16,701 --> 01:42:18,029
Hey, Luke.

1487
01:42:21,330 --> 01:42:23,737
May the Force be with you.

1488
01:42:26,709 --> 01:42:27,658
Argh!

1489
01:42:27,793 --> 01:42:30,081
Argh!

1490
01:42:30,212 --> 01:42:31,492
What are you looking at?

1491
01:42:31,630 --> 01:42:33,421
I know what I'm doing.

1492
01:42:37,843 --> 01:42:41,258
All pilots to your stations.

1493
01:42:41,387 --> 01:42:43,344
All pilots to your stations.

1494
01:42:48,601 --> 01:42:50,011
What's wrong?

1495
01:42:50,144 --> 01:42:51,638
Oh, it's Han.

1496
01:42:51,770 --> 01:42:53,976
I don't know.
I really thought he'd change his mind.

1497
01:42:54,105 --> 01:42:55,682
He's got to follow his own path.

1498
01:42:55,815 --> 01:42:57,641
No one can choose it for him.

1499
01:42:57,774 --> 01:43:01,853
I only wish Ben were here.

1500
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:11,157
Open main launch tubes.

1501
01:43:12,244 --> 01:43:14,117
Main launch tubes opening, sir.

1502
01:43:14,329 --> 01:43:15,242
Hey, Luke!

1503
01:43:15,371 --> 01:43:16,402
Biggs!

1504
01:43:16,539 --> 01:43:18,247
I don't believe it.
How are you?

1505
01:43:18,374 --> 01:43:19,239
Great.

1506
01:43:19,374 --> 01:43:20,370
Hey, coming up?

1507
01:43:20,500 --> 01:43:21,745
I'll be right up there with you...

1508
01:43:21,876 --> 01:43:23,536
and have I got stories to tell you.

1509
01:43:23,669 --> 01:43:26,918
Are you sure
you can handle this ship?

1510
01:43:27,047 --> 01:43:29,716
Sir, Luke is
the best bush pilot...

1511
01:43:29,841 --> 01:43:31,465
in the outer-rim territories.

1512
01:43:31,592 --> 01:43:32,671
You'll do all right.

1513
01:43:32,801 --> 01:43:34,081
Thank you, sir. I'll try.

1514
01:43:34,219 --> 01:43:35,796
I gotta get aboard.

1515
01:43:35,929 --> 01:43:37,127
We'll hear all your stories when
we get back, all right?

1516
01:43:37,263 --> 01:43:38,176
All right.

1517
01:43:38,305 --> 01:43:39,336
Hey, Biggs.

1518
01:43:39,473 --> 01:43:40,848
I told you I'd make it someday.

1519
01:43:40,974 --> 01:43:41,839
It'll be like old times, Luke.

1520
01:43:41,975 --> 01:43:43,683
They'll never stop us.

1521
01:43:46,854 --> 01:43:48,562
Hey, this R2 unit of yours
seems a bit beat up.

1522
01:43:48,688 --> 01:43:49,719
You want a new one?

1523
01:43:49,856 --> 01:43:51,480
Not on your life.

1524
01:43:51,607 --> 01:43:52,982
That little droid and I have
been through a lot together.

1525
01:43:53,108 --> 01:43:54,057
You OK, R2?

1526
01:43:55,819 --> 01:43:58,107
Good.

1527
01:43:58,237 --> 01:44:01,522
Gold squadron,
begin take-off procedure.

1528
01:44:01,656 --> 01:44:04,229
Hang on tight, R2.
You've got to come back.

1529
01:44:06,535 --> 01:44:08,527
You wouldn't want my life
to get boring, would you?

1530
01:44:56,907 --> 01:45:01,070
• Luke, the Force will be with you. •

1531
01:45:11,585 --> 01:45:13,043
<i>Standby alert.</i>

1532
01:45:13,169 --> 01:45:15,375
<i>Death Star approaching.</i>

1533
01:45:15,504 --> 01:45:18,623
<i>Estimated time to firing range,
15 minutes.</i>

1534
01:45:31,767 --> 01:45:32,965
All wings report in.

1535
01:45:33,101 --> 01:45:33,966
Red 10 standing by.

1536
01:45:34,102 --> 01:45:35,133
Red Seven standing by.

1537
01:45:35,270 --> 01:45:36,301
Red Three standing by.

1538
01:45:36,437 --> 01:45:37,635
Red Six standing by.

1539
01:45:37,771 --> 01:45:39,146
Red Nine standing by.

1540
01:45:39,273 --> 01:45:40,222
Red Two standing by.

1541
01:45:40,357 --> 01:45:41,306
Red 11 standing by.

1542
01:45:41,441 --> 01:45:43,267
Red Five standing by.

1543
01:45:44,693 --> 01:45:46,566
Lock S-foils in attack position.

1544
01:45:50,865 --> 01:45:52,738
We're passing through
the magnetic field.

1545
01:45:52,866 --> 01:45:54,028
Hold tight.

1546
01:45:54,159 --> 01:45:57,278
Switch your deflectors on.
Double front.

1547
01:46:00,289 --> 01:46:02,032
Look at the size of that thing!

1548
01:46:02,165 --> 01:46:04,738
Cut the chatter, Red Two.
Accelerate to attack speed.

1549
01:46:08,170 --> 01:46:09,166
This is it, boys.

1550
01:46:09,295 --> 01:46:10,872
Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.

1551
01:46:11,005 --> 01:46:12,167
I copy, Gold Leader.

1552
01:46:12,298 --> 01:46:13,792
We're starting for
the target shaft now.

1553
01:46:13,924 --> 01:46:14,920
We're in position.

1554
01:46:15,050 --> 01:46:16,129
I'm going to cut across the axis...

1555
01:46:16,259 --> 01:46:17,421
and try and draw their fire.

1556
01:46:31,854 --> 01:46:33,478
Heavy fire, boss, 23 degrees.

1557
01:46:33,606 --> 01:46:35,100
I see it. Stay low.

1558
01:46:42,571 --> 01:46:44,065
This is Red Five. I'm going in.

1559
01:46:48,575 --> 01:46:49,654
Luke, pull up!

1560
01:46:51,369 --> 01:46:52,400
Are you all right?

1561
01:46:52,537 --> 01:46:53,651
I got a little cooked, but I'm OK

1562
01:46:59,584 --> 01:47:01,208
We count 30 rebel ships, Lord Vader...

1563
01:47:01,335 --> 01:47:02,331
but they're so small...

1564
01:47:02,461 --> 01:47:03,623
they're evading our turbolasers.

1565
01:47:03,754 --> 01:47:05,580
We'll have to destroy
them ship to ship.

1566
01:47:05,713 --> 01:47:07,705
Get the crews to their fighters.

1567
01:47:10,342 --> 01:47:12,500
Watch yourself.
There's a lot of fire coming...

1568
01:47:12,635 --> 01:47:14,508
from the right side
of that deflection tower.

1569
01:47:14,637 --> 01:47:15,633
I'm on it.

1570
01:47:15,763 --> 01:47:17,672
I'm going in.
Cover me, Porkins.

1571
01:47:17,806 --> 01:47:19,051
I'm right with you,
Red Three.

1572
01:47:25,479 --> 01:47:26,724
I've got a problem here.

1573
01:47:26,855 --> 01:47:27,685
Eject.

1574
01:47:27,814 --> 01:47:28,727
I can hold it.

1575
01:47:28,856 --> 01:47:29,721
Pull up!

1576
01:47:29,857 --> 01:47:32,561
No, I'm all... Aah!

1577
01:47:35,069 --> 01:47:37,145
<i>The rebel base
will be in firing range...</i>

1578
01:47:37,279 --> 01:47:38,773
<i>in seven minutes.</i>

1579
01:47:41,866 --> 01:47:44,700
• Luke, trust your feelings. •

1580
01:47:52,499 --> 01:47:56,496
Squad leaders, we've
picked up a new group of signals.

1581
01:47:56,627 --> 01:47:58,251
Enemy fighters coming your way.

1582
01:47:58,379 --> 01:48:00,039
My scope's negative.
I don't see anything.

1583
01:48:00,172 --> 01:48:01,286
Pick up your visual scanning.

1584
01:48:01,423 --> 01:48:02,372
Here they come.

1585
01:48:05,634 --> 01:48:07,342
Watch it. You've got one
on your tail.

1586
01:48:12,723 --> 01:48:13,672
I'm hit!

1587
01:48:15,058 --> 01:48:16,137
You've picked one up!
Watch it!

1588
01:48:16,267 --> 01:48:17,595
I can't see it!

1589
01:48:19,561 --> 01:48:21,269
He's on me tight.
I can't shake him!

1590
01:48:23,022 --> 01:48:23,971
I'll be right there.

1591
01:48:36,157 --> 01:48:38,030
Several fighters have broken off...

1592
01:48:38,159 --> 01:48:40,614
from the main group.
Come with me.

1593
01:48:43,580 --> 01:48:46,070
Fall in! Fall in!

1594
01:48:46,207 --> 01:48:47,156
Watch your back, Luke.

1595
01:48:47,291 --> 01:48:48,240
Watch your back.

1596
01:48:48,375 --> 01:48:49,620
Fighters above you, coming in.

1597
01:48:55,964 --> 01:48:57,043
I'm hit, but not bad.

1598
01:48:57,173 --> 01:48:58,548
R2, see what you can do with it.

1599
01:48:58,675 --> 01:49:00,833
Hang on back there.

1600
01:49:00,968 --> 01:49:03,505
Red Six, can you see Red Five?

1601
01:49:03,637 --> 01:49:05,131
There's a heavy fire zone.

1602
01:49:05,263 --> 01:49:06,093
Red Five, where are you?

1603
01:49:06,222 --> 01:49:07,632
I can't shake him!

1604
01:49:11,726 --> 01:49:13,184
I'm on him, Luke. Hold on.

1605
01:49:16,438 --> 01:49:18,062
Blast it, Biggs! Where are you?

1606
01:49:25,111 --> 01:49:26,142
Thanks, Wedge.

1607
01:49:26,279 --> 01:49:28,520
Good shooting,
Wedge. Red Leader...

1608
01:49:28,656 --> 01:49:29,818
this is Gold Leader.

1609
01:49:29,948 --> 01:49:31,062
We're starting our attack run.

1610
01:49:32,909 --> 01:49:35,364
I copy, Gold Leader.
Move into position.

1611
01:49:37,704 --> 01:49:39,945
Stay in attack formation.

1612
01:49:40,081 --> 01:49:42,951
The exhaust port
is marked and locked in.

1613
01:49:48,796 --> 01:49:49,994
Switch all power...

1614
01:49:50,130 --> 01:49:52,585
to front deflector screen.

1615
01:49:52,716 --> 01:49:54,174
Switch all power...

1616
01:49:54,300 --> 01:49:56,209
to front deflector screen.

1617
01:49:59,971 --> 01:50:01,679
How many guns do you think,
Gold Five?

1618
01:50:01,806 --> 01:50:02,968
Say about 20 guns...

1619
01:50:03,099 --> 01:50:05,008
some on the surface,
some on the towers.

1620
01:50:05,142 --> 01:50:07,976
<i>Death Star will be in range
in five minutes.</i>

1621
01:50:10,104 --> 01:50:13,104
Switch to targeting computer.

1622
01:50:15,608 --> 01:50:17,600
Computer locked. Getting a signal.

1623
01:50:19,653 --> 01:50:22,108
The guns! They've stopped!

1624
01:50:23,823 --> 01:50:25,198
Stabilise your rear deflectors.

1625
01:50:25,324 --> 01:50:27,032
Watch for enemy fighters.

1626
01:50:27,159 --> 01:50:28,902
They're coming in!
Three marks at 210.

1627
01:50:30,912 --> 01:50:33,034
I'll take them myself.
Cover me.

1628
01:50:33,163 --> 01:50:34,443
Yes, sir.

1629
01:50:49,009 --> 01:50:50,040
It's no good.
I can't manoeuvre.

1630
01:50:50,176 --> 01:50:51,207
Stay on target.

1631
01:50:51,344 --> 01:50:52,209
We're too close.

1632
01:50:52,345 --> 01:50:53,376
Stay on target.

1633
01:50:55,180 --> 01:50:56,129
Loosen up!

1634
01:50:59,225 --> 01:51:01,976
Gold Five to Red Leader,
lost Tiree, lost Hutch.

1635
01:51:02,102 --> 01:51:03,347
I copy, Gold Leader.

1636
01:51:03,478 --> 01:51:04,427
They came from behind.

1637
01:51:09,149 --> 01:51:11,022
We've analyzed their attack, sir...

1638
01:51:11,151 --> 01:51:13,523
and there is a danger.

1639
01:51:13,652 --> 01:51:16,059
Should I have your
ship standing by?

1640
01:51:16,196 --> 01:51:19,066
Evacuate in our moment of triumph?

1641
01:51:19,198 --> 01:51:20,906
I think you overestimate
their chances.

1642
01:51:21,033 --> 01:51:23,702
<i>Rebel base, three minutes
and closing.</i>

1643
01:51:23,827 --> 01:51:26,282
Red boys, this is Red Leader.

1644
01:51:26,412 --> 01:51:27,787
Rendezvous at mark 6.1.

1645
01:51:27,913 --> 01:51:30,071
This is Red Two flying toward you.

1646
01:51:30,207 --> 01:51:32,080
Red Three standing by.

1647
01:51:32,208 --> 01:51:33,750
Red Leader, this is Base One.

1648
01:51:33,876 --> 01:51:35,334
Keep half your group
out of range...

1649
01:51:35,461 --> 01:51:36,741
for the next run.

1650
01:51:36,879 --> 01:51:39,251
Copy, Base One. Luke,
take Red Two and Three.

1651
01:51:39,380 --> 01:51:42,665
Hold up here and wait for
my signal to start your run.

1652
01:51:50,514 --> 01:51:52,305
This is it!

1653
01:51:56,894 --> 01:51:58,970
We should be able to see it by now.

1654
01:52:00,688 --> 01:52:02,431
Keep your eyes open
for those fighters.

1655
01:52:04,149 --> 01:52:05,429
There's too much interference.

1656
01:52:05,567 --> 01:52:06,646
Red Five, can you see them
from where you are?

1657
01:52:06,776 --> 01:52:08,649
No sign of any...
Wait. Coming in.35.

1658
01:52:08,778 --> 01:52:09,727
I see them.

1659
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:12,359
I'm in range.

1660
01:52:13,657 --> 01:52:14,606
Target's coming up.

1661
01:52:17,951 --> 01:52:20,073
Just hold them off
for a few seconds.

1662
01:52:20,203 --> 01:52:22,491
Close up formation.

1663
01:52:23,873 --> 01:52:26,031
Almost there.

1664
01:52:35,131 --> 01:52:37,040
You'd better let her loose.
They're right behind me.

1665
01:52:37,258 --> 01:52:38,372
Almost there.

1666
01:52:39,801 --> 01:52:41,425
I can't hold them.

1667
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:44,380
Aah!

1668
01:52:49,684 --> 01:52:51,142
It's away!

1669
01:52:54,980 --> 01:52:56,474
It's a hit!

1670
01:52:56,606 --> 01:52:58,645
Negative, negative.
It didn't go in.

1671
01:52:58,774 --> 01:53:01,395
It just impacted on the surface.

1672
01:53:07,948 --> 01:53:09,525
Red Leader, we're right above you.

1673
01:53:09,658 --> 01:53:11,946
Turn to .05.
We'll cover for you.

1674
01:53:12,076 --> 01:53:15,527
Stay there. I just lost
my starboard engine.

1675
01:53:15,662 --> 01:53:17,903
Get set up for your attack run.

1676
01:53:22,542 --> 01:53:24,166
Aah!

1677
01:53:30,715 --> 01:53:33,834
<i>Rebel base,
one minute and closing.</i>

1678
01:53:33,968 --> 01:53:36,174
Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.

1679
01:53:36,303 --> 01:53:38,094
We're going in full throttle.

1680
01:53:38,221 --> 01:53:39,596
That ought to keep those
fighters off our back.

1681
01:53:39,806 --> 01:53:41,798
Right with you, boss.

1682
01:53:41,932 --> 01:53:44,173
Luke, at that speed, will you be able
to pull out in time?

1683
01:53:44,309 --> 01:53:46,301
It'll be just like
Beggars Canyon back home.

1684
01:53:53,649 --> 01:53:55,855
We'll stay back
far enough to cover you.

1685
01:53:55,985 --> 01:53:57,016
My scope shows the tower...

1686
01:53:57,152 --> 01:53:58,527
but I can't see the exhaust port.

1687
01:53:58,653 --> 01:54:00,111
Are you sure
the computer can hit it?

1688
01:54:03,574 --> 01:54:05,566
Watch yourself.
Increase speed, full throttle.

1689
01:54:05,700 --> 01:54:06,945
What about that tower?

1690
01:54:07,076 --> 01:54:08,190
You worry about those fighters!

1691
01:54:08,327 --> 01:54:09,489
I'll worry about the tower!

1692
01:54:15,124 --> 01:54:18,077
R2, that stabiliser's
broken loose again.

1693
01:54:18,210 --> 01:54:19,490
See if you can't lock it down.

1694
01:54:28,217 --> 01:54:30,423
Fighters coming in.3.

1695
01:54:38,475 --> 01:54:40,882
I'm hit!
I can't stay with you!

1696
01:54:41,019 --> 01:54:43,344
Get clear, Wedge.
You can't do any more good back there.

1697
01:54:43,479 --> 01:54:44,428
Sorry.

1698
01:54:45,689 --> 01:54:47,432
Let him go.
Stay on the leader.

1699
01:54:50,443 --> 01:54:51,901
Hurry, Luke. They're coming in
much faster this time.

1700
01:54:52,027 --> 01:54:53,189
We can't hold them.

1701
01:54:56,823 --> 01:54:58,151
R2, try and increase the power.

1702
01:55:04,912 --> 01:55:06,074
Hurry up, Luke!

1703
01:55:06,205 --> 01:55:07,699
Quick! Quick!

1704
01:55:15,253 --> 01:55:17,743
<i>Rebel base, 30 seconds and closing.</i>

1705
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:18,959
I'm on the leader.

1706
01:55:22,467 --> 01:55:23,842
Hang on, R2.

1707
01:55:39,397 --> 01:55:41,685
• Use the Force, Luke. •

1708
01:55:44,567 --> 01:55:46,559
• Let go, Luke. •

1709
01:55:48,695 --> 01:55:50,983
The Force is strong with this one.

1710
01:55:51,114 --> 01:55:52,691
• Luke, trust me. •

1711
01:55:58,244 --> 01:55:59,572
His computer's off.

1712
01:55:59,704 --> 01:56:01,577
Luke, you switched off
your targeting computer!

1713
01:56:01,705 --> 01:56:03,282
What's wrong?

1714
01:56:03,415 --> 01:56:05,039
Nothing. I'm all right.

1715
01:56:17,968 --> 01:56:19,166
I've lost R2!

1716
01:56:20,762 --> 01:56:23,596
<i>The Death Star
has cleared the planet.</i>

1717
01:56:23,722 --> 01:56:26,508
<i>The Death Star
has cleared the planet.</i>

1718
01:56:26,641 --> 01:56:28,265
<i>Rebel base in range.</i>

1719
01:56:28,392 --> 01:56:30,847
You may fire when ready.

1720
01:56:30,978 --> 01:56:33,184
<i>Commence primary ignition.</i>

1721
01:56:46,323 --> 01:56:47,947
I have you now.

1722
01:56:50,284 --> 01:56:51,363
What?

1723
01:56:51,493 --> 01:56:52,442
Yahoo!

1724
01:56:54,287 --> 01:56:55,615
Look out!

1725
01:57:01,751 --> 01:57:04,537
You're all clear, kid!
Now let's blow this thing and go home!

1726
01:57:11,384 --> 01:57:12,794
<i>Stand by.</i>

1727
01:57:15,845 --> 01:57:17,303
<i>Stand by.</i>

1728
01:57:27,938 --> 01:57:28,803
Great shot, kid!

1729
01:57:28,939 --> 01:57:31,097
That was one in a million!

1730
01:57:31,232 --> 01:57:35,727
• Remember, the Force
will be with you — always. •

1731
01:57:54,166 --> 01:57:55,624
Luke!

1732
01:57:59,587 --> 01:58:00,962
Hey! Hey!

1733
01:58:01,088 --> 01:58:02,831
I knew you'd come back.
I just knew it.

1734
01:58:02,965 --> 01:58:04,245
Well, I wasn't going to let you
get all the credit...

1735
01:58:04,382 --> 01:58:05,662
and take all the reward.

1736
01:58:05,800 --> 01:58:08,337
Hey, I knew there was
more to you than money.

1737
01:58:08,469 --> 01:58:09,631
Oh, no!

1738
01:58:09,761 --> 01:58:12,168
Oh, my. R2, can you hear me?

1739
01:58:12,305 --> 01:58:15,673
Say something.
You can repair him, can't you?

1740
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:17,599
We'll get to work
on him right away.

1741
01:58:17,726 --> 01:58:19,054
You must repair him.

1742
01:58:19,185 --> 01:58:21,058
Sir, if any of my circuits
or gears will help...

1743
01:58:21,187 --> 01:58:22,052
I'll gladly donate them.

1744
01:58:22,187 --> 01:58:23,301
He'll be all right.
