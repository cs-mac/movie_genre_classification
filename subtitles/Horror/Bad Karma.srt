- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm there.

Second night of freedom,
the fucker gets pulled over for DUI.

100
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,949
It took five cops
to get him in the car.

Only five, eh?

102
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,692

Woman: Welcome to
the land of the living.

149
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,525
I was driving.

150
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,661
I felt like--

151
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,528
like my che--

152
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,658
like an elephant sat
on my chest.

153
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,636
You had a heart attack,
Mr. Molloy.

154
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:55,863
I had a heart attack?

155
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:59,540
It's hardly surprising,

156
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,567
given this toxicology report.

157
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,911
My best estimation
is that your heart stopped

158
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,574
somewhere around
the North Street exit.

159
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:16,186
( Horn honking continuously)

160
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:20,527
It seems that the impact
of your chest hitting the steering wheel

161
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,863
restarted your heart.

162
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,028
Do you understand
what I'm telling you, Mr. Molloy?

163
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,931
It's a miracle you're alive.

164
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,202
However, there are indications

165
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,806
that you've suffered
some heart damage.

166
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,840
Heart damage?

167
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:42,614
It's minor.

168
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,918
With medication,

169
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,220
you should be able to live
a normal life...

170
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,186
provided you clean up
your act.

- Hey, come here.
-( buzzer sounds)

185
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:09,205
Come on, I'll buy you lunch.
I got something to tell you. Come here.

186
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,869
- I don't look hungry, do I?
- You do a little.

187
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,773
- No lie?
- Yeah, I got the ring and everything.

188
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:19,407
Bullshit.

189
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,475
Well, let's see it.

190
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,851
I didn't bring it to work, did I?

191
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:25,878
It's expensive.

192
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,050
When are you gonna
pop the question?

193
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,923
Friday night.

194
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,485
I got it all planned out.

195
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,190
I got a nice new suit.

196
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,096
I'm gonna get dressed up
really nice.

197
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,499
- Yeah.
- And then I'm gonna-- I'm gonna-

198
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,806
Parole officer.

199
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,401
I'm gonna leave you
with it, brother.

200
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,002
Thanks.

201
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,976
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

202
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,488
- Good.
- Everything going well?

203
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,424
Yeah.

204
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,655
All right, well, you know
the routine. Let's see it.

205
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:05,923
Yes, sir.

206
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,763
( Pills rattle)

207
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:19,836
So how is your mate Bear?
Keeping out of trouble?

208
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:21,139
Yeah, yeah.

209
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,704
No, we're both doing really good.
We're model citizens now.

210
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,613
(man chuckles)
Yeah, that's good.

211
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,118
- Keep it up.
-( snickering )

212
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:30,714
Something funny?

213
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,349
No, no, I was-
I was thinking of something.

214
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,859
He was telling me a joke
and it just registered.

215
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:38,122
Huh. This is new.

216
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,721
Yeah, she just got
her hair cut, so...

217
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,063
I just think
she looks stunning.

218
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:46,001
Well, they sort of make it all
worthwhile, don't they?

219
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,631
She does for me.

220
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,569
Well, say hello
to your mate Bear for me.

221
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:52,667
- Yeah.
- All right.

222
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:54,302
- It's good seeing you.
- Keep up the good work, mate.

223
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,108
Okay, thanks.

224
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:00,545
- See ya, Bear.
- All right.

225
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:07,513
- He says hello.
-( laughs )

226
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,486
Bear: You still haven't told her
you're an ex-con.

227
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,396
Molloy: That's not the easiest thing
to work into a conversation.

228
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,422
Yeah, okay.
Well, try this:

229
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:18,867
She goes, "How was
work today, Molloy?"

230
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,735
You go, "Better than doing
three to five years

231
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,366
- in the Long Bay Correctional, honey."
-( laughing )

232
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,573
That's a lot of help, Bear.

233
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:31,241
Seriously, listen, listen.

234
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,580
Better that she hears it
from you

235
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,279
than from your P.O.

236
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,517
I know.

237
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,432
Ba by!

238
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:31,805
I'm here.

239
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,832
Where's my gorgeous girl?

240
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,308
Hi.

241
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,374
Give me a kiss.

242
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,249
- Hi.
- Gorgeous, how was work?

243
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,617
- It was good.
- Yeah?

244
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,246
- I left early.
- I could see that.

245
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,188
- It looks great.
- Look at that.

246
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:49,556
- Look at this.
- I know.

247
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:52,460
Wow, we could probably
cook in here tonight.

248
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,293
We can cook
in here tonight,

249
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,266
but we've got
two of everything.

250
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,268
I see a garage sale
in our future.

251
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,564
- Really?
- Yeah.

252
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,593
What else do you see
in our future?

253
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,836
Well, actually I'm trying
not to think about it,

254
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,308
not get too far
ahead of myself.

255
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,504
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

256
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,207
Really? And your five-year-plan-
that just doesn't exist?

257
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:13,114
That's not really a plan.
It's more of a reminder.

258
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,277
<i>Oh, "I'll create
three new lines of jewelry,</i>

259
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,311
establish an online presence,
open a shop in Melbourne."

260
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,346
Yes, okay,
maybe it is a plan,

261
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,757
- but seriously...
- What?

262
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:25,125
I'm trying to be
less anal about it.

263
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,959
What?

264
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,092
( laughs ) I'm trying to be
less anal about it.

265
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,124
- Wait, wait, what was that?
- You heard me.

266
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,932
- You know what?
- Yeah?

267
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,064
I love when you talk dirty.

268
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,085
Hey, Kel?

269
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,792
Mm-hmm?

270
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,796
- ( Sighs )
- What?

271
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,874
I love you so much.

272
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,741
I love you too.

273
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,722
- You hungry?
- I'm so hungry.

274
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,984
Okay, what do you
want me to get?

275
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:34,794
- There you go, mate.
- All right. Thank you.

276
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,476
- What's up, Sammy?
- Hey, Molloy.

277
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,107
How are the flowers
doing tonight?

278
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:10,063
( laughs)

279
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,501
Let me see this.

280
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,611
You know why he doesn't
ask her for it?

281
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:24,113
'Cause he's a pussy.

282
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,241
Holy shite.

283
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,683
When did you get out?

284
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,483
About a week ago.

285
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,512
I thought they had you
for another year.

286
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:35,024
They did.
I cut a deal.

287
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,425
Told 'em I had a big fish.

288
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:39,953
How have you been?

289
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,459
- Good.
- Good.

290
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,867
Good, you know,
just one day at a time.

291
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,097
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

292
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,163
How is your heart?

293
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,868
( Chuckles )
it's-- it's good.

294
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:53,877
The doctor says
if I avoid stress

295
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:56,175
I'll be good for another
100,000 miles.

296
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,805
That's good.

297
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:01,215
I gotta say, mate,
you're an original.

298
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,776
(chuckles)

299
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:06,017
Driving that car into
a fucking pharmacy-- fuck.

300
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:08,388
I was in jail
when I heard that,

301
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:10,689
laughed my
fucking ass off.

302
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,457
You got time for a drink?

303
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,260
No, man, I'm sober.
I've been sober for three years.

304
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:16,960
Oh, good for you.
Good for you.

305
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,560
- That's great. Look--
- My parole officer's been on me

306
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:22,504
like bark on a tree.
If he sees me talking to another ex-con,

307
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,771
I'm fucked. He's gonna violate my ass
so fast, it'll make your head spin.

308
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:27,470
- So...
- So I'll make it brief.

309
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,743
I got something on,
a two-man job,

310
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,612
high-risk. high-yield.

311
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,982
You've been out a week.

312
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,748
What, are you already
looking to go back?

313
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:39,517
I'm not gonna go back, mate.
I'm just looking for a partner.

314
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,057
Me?

315
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:45,152
What, are you
out of your mind?

316
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,686
Just hear me out.

317
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,426
Just drop it.

318
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:52,060
She got you
by the balls, eh?

319
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,433
What?

320
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,460
Your girl-- she's got you
by the balls.

321
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:58,866
- Anything else?
- No, that's it. That's it.

322
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:00,808
Hey, mate, are we cool on this?
I'm just fucking with you.

323
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:02,505
- Yeah, yeah, we're cool. We're cool.
- All right.

324
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,014
- Open the fucking register.
- Yates, just don't.

325
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,313
Just do what he says.
All right, all right, all right.

326
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,977
- Easy, easy.
- Shut up. Move over.

327
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:11,214
Sammy, just do what he says.
Do what he says.

328
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,713
Yates.

329
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:15,190
- Fill them up. Hurry up.
- No.

330
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,194
- Let's go.
- Fill it up your fucking self.

331
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,429
Fucking hurry up.

332
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:24,024
Jesus.
Yates, what the fuck?

333
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,265
Jesus Christ, Yates.
What the fuck's the matter with you?

334
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,932
The sooner you fill them,
the sooner he gets to see a doctor.

335
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:31,305
All right, all right, all right.

336
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:37,109
Hang in there, Sammy.

337
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:38,478
Go.

338
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,250
And your wallet.

339
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:44,584
Okay, here.

340
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,216
Here we go.
All right.

341
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:52,589
Smile.

342
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,225
And while you're at it,
some smokes.

343
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,736
Oh. Oh.

344
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,499
Come on.

345
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:03,403
What's up with you, mate?

346
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,637
Oh, Jesus. Oh.
Ow. Ow.

347
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,702
You all right?
Fucking-A.

348
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:14,377
Better living
through chemistry, eh?

349
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,582
What the fuck?

350
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,127
Sam.

351
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:29,132
Sammy.

352
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:30,861
What the fuck
are you doing?

353
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:31,924
(gunshot)

354
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:07,635
(distant sirens wailing)

355
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,128
- Hey, sweetie.
- Oh.

356
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:49,366
You scared me.

357
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:51,931
What took you so long?

358
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:53,772
Oh.

359
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,873
They're beautiful.

360
00:23:58,303 --> 00:23:59,646
Thank you.

361
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:05,687
-( TV chatter )
- You know what's crazy?

362
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,486
It's that I've got
a whole other load

363
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:10,686
of boxes at my apartment.

364
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,561
Are you okay
with this, Jack?

365
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:20,369
What? I'm sorry, baby.
What?

366
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,736
Giving up this room.
I don't want you to feel

367
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:25,002
like I'm, you know,
taking over.

368
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:28,068
No, no, no, no, it's fine.
I want you to take over.

369
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:29,635
It's absolutely fine.

370
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:32,080
I just used it
for storage anyhow.

371
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:34,140
I'm just sorry it's so small.

372
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:36,015
Are you kidding me?
It's perfect.

373
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:38,146
Okay.

374
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:42,022
( News jingle plays )

375
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:44,049
Anchor: Two people
have been shot dead

376
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,961
in an armed robbery
at a convenience store.

377
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:50,660
Residents are not demanding police
crack down on gangs of armed thugs

378
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:53,636
responsible for a wave of crime
on the tourist strip.

379
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,366
We cross to our reporter
live outside the scene

380
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:58,396
of the latest shooting.

381

Reporter: Police who are searching
for two white male suspects...

382
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:03,845
- Sweetie.
- ...In a robbery in which...

383
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,849
- Yeah.
- ...two people were killed.

384
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:09,284
Honey, can I use
some of your muscle, please?

385
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:13,245
( Cat mews )

Yates: Smile.

389
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,016
- Kel.
- Yeah?

390
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:28,463
Kel, my car's running rough.

391
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:30,796
- Can I take you to work...
- Yeah.

392
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:33,894
- ...and pick you up after?
- Yeah, sure. Of course.

393
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,269
What's mine is yours.

394
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:40,799
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

395
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:42,675
I'll see you downstairs.

396
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:43,873
Okay.

397
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:57,851
Thanks, sweetie.

398
00:26:57,882 --> 00:26:59,691
Have a beautiful day.

399
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:08,966
Oh, I forgot cash.
Can I borrow some?

400
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,405
Oh, shoot.

401
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:15,934
- I must have lost my wallet.
- Oh.

402
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,038
Probably fell out
at work again. Sorry.

403
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:20,515
No, that's fine.
I'll stop by the ATM at lunch.

404
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:22,540
- All right.
- All right. Bye.

405
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,532
- Good morning, Lisa.
- You would not believe

406
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:40,399
the morning I have had.

407
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,269
(car lock chirps)

408
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,779
Fuck!

409
00:28:57,635 --> 00:29:00,172
(siren wailing)

410
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:01,684
It's open.

411
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:07,421
Hi. Oh, I hope you had
a better day than I did.

412
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:09,356
Don't tell me. Lisa?

413
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,155
Yep. Major melodrama.

414
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:12,490
( Chuckles )
What happened now?

415
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:15,191
- Oh, off with the boyfriend again.
-( woman speaking on radio)

416
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,133
I just-- I just can't
hear it again-

417
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:21,899
breaking up, back together;
happy, sad.

418
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,610
Did your wallet turn up?

419
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:35,347
- What?
- Your wallet. Did your wallet turn up?

420
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:37,216
Uh, no.

421
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:39,449
I had to cancel
the credit cards.

422
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:42,515
Oh. Maybe you should
call the police.

423
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:44,254
Hey, hey, Kel.

424
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:50,898
- Have you been messing with my hat?
- No.

425
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:55,098
Not since the APA declared it harmful
to women and small animals.

426
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:58,973
You coming?

427
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:00,806
Yeah, I'll be right there.

428
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:02,470
Curtis.
( kisses )

429
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,675
Honey, I'm beat.

430
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:45,984
Do you mind if we get takeaway
again tonight?

431
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,225
Okay.

432
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,923
We could get Thai.

433
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,523
There's that great place
up on Baldwin's.

434
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,761
They do a fantastic curry.

435
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,806
Yeah, that sounds good.

436
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:20,853
I hope you're hungry.

437
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,950
I got a lot.
What did you order?

438
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:26,588
I just was about to call you.
Your friend Gary popped by.

439
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:27,995
Who?

440
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:29,259
Gary.

441
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:30,527
Gary?

442
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,466
Love what you've done
with the place.

443
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,128
Oh, there he is.

444
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:35,660
Hey, big fella.

445
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:37,695
Guess what I found.

446
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,634
Must have fallen out
in the dark.

447
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:41,871
Kelly: Oh.

448
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,641
It's all there.

449
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,406
Anyway.

450
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:51,113
I'd best be
getting out of here.

451
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:53,281
- It was a pleasure meeting you.
- You too.

452
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:55,313
Just for the record,

453
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,417
you're too good for him.

454
00:31:57,448 --> 00:32:00,520
That's what I keep
telling him.

455
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:02,997
Um, why don't you stay
for dinner?

456
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:04,728
We've got Thai.

457
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:07,725
And it never actually
occurred to me

458
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,706
that somebody sat down
with a chunk of silver

459
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:14,574
and fashioned it into a ring
or a bracelet

460
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,601
or whatever.

461
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:19,308
I know it sounds lame.

462
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:22,442
I'm sorry.

463
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:25,010
I'm babbling on.
You must be bored stiff.

464
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,649
Not at all.
It's fascinating.

465
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,149
I have a tendency
to be a bit obsessive.

466
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:33,628
Ask Jack about
my five-year plan.

467
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:37,826
I've just set up a studio
in our spare bedroom.

468
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:39,266
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

469
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,065
I'd love to see it.

470
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:43,231
- Really?
- Yeah.

471
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:48,642
Okay, so it's still
a work in progress.

472
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:51,078
Oh, no, it's great.
A little tight maybe.

473
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:53,048
Yeah.

474
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:54,709
It's a start.

475
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:57,083
I want to open up
my own shop one day.

476
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:58,610
- That's smart.
- Yeah.

477
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,179
- Cut out the middle man.
- Exactly.

478
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:02,248
-( Cell phone ringing )
- All I need is capital.

479
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,227
- Jack: Hello.
- Oh, that's beautiful.

480
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:07,855
You just seemed
a little jumpy yesterday,

481
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:09,922
so I'm just calling up to make sure
everything's okay.

482
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:11,558
Hey, yeah.

483
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:13,227
And work's all good?

484
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:15,237
You don't have any issues there
you would need to talk about?

485
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:17,762
- Work is fine, you know, just-
- Oh, it's beautiful.

486
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:20,708
- And this one too. It's my favorite.
- Just same old stuff, same old.

487
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,109
All right.

488
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:24,545
Well, just remember,
if you need me, you give me a call.

489
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,571
- Oh, I appreciate that.
- Kelly: It's my favorite.

490
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:28,606
Kelly: Yeah,
it's kind of the Aztec...

491
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:30,641
- Jack: Okay, yep. Thanks.
- Yates: May I?

492
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,951
It's beautiful.

493
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:34,479
Thank you.

494
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,992
- It's absolutely beautiful.
- Let's go. I'll walk you out.

495
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,619
- All right.
- Kelly: Okay.

496
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:40,026
- See you.
- See you. Nice to meet you.

497
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:41,655
- Yeah, see you around.
- Yeah, likewise.

498
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,632
- I'll be right back.
- All right, sweetie.

499
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:56,172
So tell me about this
five-year plan.

500
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,702
Stay away from her.

501
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:01,379
What do you think
you're doing?

502
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:04,819
Hmm? Look, I don't blame you
for not telling her

503
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:06,981
about our little escapade
at the convenience store.

504
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:08,922
Chicks can be funny
about that that stuff-

505
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:11,756
all that violence
and stuff.

506
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:14,593
What's it gonna take
to get you out of my life?

507
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:16,963
Now why the fuck would I want
to get out of your life?

508
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,592
What do you want?

509
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:22,332
I told you, I need a partner,
someone I can trust.

510
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,203
There's good money
in it, mate.

511
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,730
Think of Kelly.

512
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:29,000
You stay away from us.

513
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:32,378
If I see you, if I hear you,
if I even get a fucking whiff of you,

514
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,713
I'm gonna rip your fucking world apart.
You understand me?

515
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,844
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, fuck.

516
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:40,720
Oh. Oh. Oh.

517
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,419
What's going on, mate?
What's going on, big fellow?

518
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:46,395
Oh, what's this?

519
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,897
Nitro-- nitroglycerin.

520
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,593
Take when needed.

521
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:52,726
I guess that's about now, huh?

522
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,828
Did you lie about
your heart, mate,

523
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:57,066
said it was some kind of
genetic defect,

524
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,041
that you were born with it?

525
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:01,236
You sold me out, didn't you?

526
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,108
- What?
- You sold me out.

527
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:05,136
I had a fucking heart attack.

528
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:08,844
Still there was no need
to squeal like a fucking pig.

529
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,411
You know what?
You're gonna fuck--

530
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,515
you're gonna fucking
do this for me

531
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:18,083
one way or the other,
you fucking dog.

532
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:39,138
Honey, that was fun last night,
wasn't it?

533
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,081
Yeah, it was a blast.

534
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:43,085
Do you need my car today?

535
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:46,179
No, I'm all set. I just need
to blow out the fuel filter.

536
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:49,054
Oh, I love it
when you talk dirty.

537
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,117
- I love you.
- Have a good day.

538
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,295
- Gary, hi.
- Hiya, love.

539
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:32,858
Hi. ls everything okay?

540
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,496
Yeah, everything's fine.
I just was in the neighborhood

541
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,767
and I wanted to thank you
again for last night.

542
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:39,968
Like I said, anytime.

543
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:42,170
That's not the real reason
I'm here.

544
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,941
Really?

545
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:45,276
No.

546
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:46,873
I want to show you
something.

547
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,041
- Is Jack in on this?
- No, no, no, no.

548
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:52,816
But it does have something to do
with your five-year plan.

549
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:54,880
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

550
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,914
It's not far from here.

551
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:58,950
I mean, it's, like,
five minutes.

552
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,129
Um, okay.

553
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:04,190
- Well, I'll just go and get my jacket.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

554
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,963
Okay. All right.

555
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:36,460
No worries.

556
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,942
Molloy, the boss said
you were looking for me.

557
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:51,139
Yeah.

558
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:56,180
Did you hear about
the convenience store job?

559
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:03,381
What?

560
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:05,724
You're different
than I expected.

561
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,457
Oh.

562
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:08,987
How so?

563
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,057
You're not Molloy's type.

564
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:14,365
Really?

565
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:16,394
Why is that?

566
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:18,429
You got too much class.

567
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,373
( Both chuckle)

568
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:23,675
The videotape is gonna show

569
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:26,204
me and Yates talking
like we were planning it out.

570
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:28,877
10 seconds later
he kills the kid.

571
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:31,477
Next thing I know,
I'm emptying the register.

572
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:33,648
10 seconds after that
he kills the woman.

573
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,148
Like you were in it together?

574
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,759
I couldn't go to the cops.

575
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:43,857
Well, if you did, we'd be talking
through glass again.

576
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:46,664
I don't know what to fucking do.
I don't know what to do.

577
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,634
- What do you think?
- I love it.

578
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:57,544
(laughs ) Oh my God,
Jack is going to absolutely flip.

579
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:02,009
Yates-

580
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:04,485
he didn't just happen
to run into you.

581
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:07,216
He planned this.
He set you up,

582
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:09,554
that crazy fuck.

583
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,355
What am I gonna do?

584
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:13,384
Have you told your woman
about any of this?

585
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:15,158
No, no, no, man.

586
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,166
Listen, Molloy,

587
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,725
I gotta go, all right?

588
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:21,998
But I'm off tomorrow.
Anything you need-

589
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,028
you just let me know.

590
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,201
Whew. Fuck.

591
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:43,191
How much do you know
about him?

592
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,125
- About his past?
- Yeah.

593
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,823
I know he moved here from LA
about eight years ago

594
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:49,490
after a divorce, no kids.

595
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,864
Left a good job in Sydney
'cause of the stress.

596
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,335
This is fantastic.

597
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:58,668
Why? Have you got
some dirt on him?

598
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:00,937
Might have.

599
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:02,967
(cell phone ringing )

600
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,139
Duty calls.

601
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:06,546
Lisa?

602
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,994
What are you talking about?
What space?

603
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:22,691
Well, he came by the shop

604
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,996
and said that he had
something to show me.

605
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:27,502
And you just went off
with him?

606
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:30,131
Yeah. Why wouldn't I?
He's your friend, isn't he?

607
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:33,404
No, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I just-

608
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,571
Anyway, this space is fantastic.
You're gonna love it.

609
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,602
The light is-.

610
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:40,912
It's killer.
It's brilliant.

611
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:44,715
He said he's got some kind
of a deal in the works.

612
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:46,050
What kind of deal?

613
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:48,147
I don't know.
He didn't go into detail,

614
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,181
but just that he's closing
in a week or two

615
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:54,663
and when he's done,
he wants to invest.

616
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:57,894
He wants me to come up
with some kind of a business plan

617
00:40:57,922 --> 00:40:59,663
by the weekend.

618
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,364
You really shouldn't have
just gone off with him.

619
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:05,697
Are you jealous?

620
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:07,572
No, I..

621
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:10,101
- You are.
- No.

622
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:13,377
Well, you shouldn't be,
'cause all we talked about was you.

623
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,948
(glass clinking)

624
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,011
(distant dog barking )

625
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:22,320
- What was that?
- What was what?

626
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,571
- Honey, what's going on?
- Stay right here.

627
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:03,161
What's going on?
Are you all right?

628
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:06,396
Yeah, I saw someone
checking door handles.

629
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:08,767
He-- he stole that car

630
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,863
I was just trying to stop him.

631
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:13,671
Stopping a moving vehicle?
Are you crazy?

632
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,404
It's okay.

633
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:17,343
Kelly: Let's go inside.

634
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,870
Maybe we should call
the police.

635
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:21,247
No, I didn't get
a license plate number.

636
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:23,684
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

637
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,175
Yeah.

638
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:32,876
( Phone ringing )

639
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:38,650
Yeah.

640
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:41,356
Rule number one:
always know where the camera is.

641
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:43,387
I don't suppose
this is the original, is it?

642
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,592
You suppose right.

643
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,603
Piccolo's on Broadbeach,
20 minutes.

644
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:54,974
Hey, um,

645
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:56,569
that was someone
from work.

646
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,739
I gotta go meet him
for some coffee.

647
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:01,340
- He's having some trouble.
- Okay.

648
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:24,963
Come on, Kelly, pick up.

649
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,233
Damn it.

650
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:31,205
- Kelly! Kel--
- Yeah, I'm in here, honey.

651
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,731
Oh, that was a long coffee.
I've got to go.

652
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:36,267
I just called you, like, a minute ago.
Why--?

653
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,473
Well, I was just-
I was blow-drying my hair.

654
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:54,554
Hey, Molloy.

655
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:57,031
This was on my desk
when I came in this morning.

656
00:45:58,021 --> 00:46:00,160
Thanks, boss.

657
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:51,912
(water running)

658
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:54,354
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

659
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:57,154
No, no, no, no, no.

660
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:59,058
Oh.

661
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:02,126
Oh, fuck.

662
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,024
No!

663
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:21,605
-( phone ringing )
- Oh my God.

664
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:26,944
Yeah.

665
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:30,357
I hate myself, mate.
I really do.

666
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:31,950
Listen to me,
you motherfucker.

667
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:34,588
If you come near her again,
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

668
00:47:34,618 --> 00:47:38,122
Rule number two: don't make a threat
unless you can back it up.

669
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:42,501
All right, look,
we need to talk.

670
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:45,632
- We are talking.
- No. No, no, no, face to face.

671
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:47,573
You win.

672
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:50,442
You've proved your point.

673
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:53,209
I'll do the job.
I'm in, okay?

674
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:54,443
All right, mate.

675
00:47:54,471 --> 00:47:57,077
I'm not feeling the love.

676
00:47:57,107 --> 00:47:59,519
Just do the fucking math.

677
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:02,285
I want you out of my life
for good.

678
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:03,882
You understand me?

679
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:07,225
I do this job--
I get that video tape, the original.

680
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:10,425
And then you disappear.
That's what's gotta happen.

681
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:12,559
Sounds more than fair.

682
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:16,503
Meet me at 10:00
at Elsewhere.

683
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:18,199
Do you know where that is?

684
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:22,142
I was baptized there.
It was a beautiful thing.

685
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:23,803
I'll meet you there.

686
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:25,370
Don't be late, Molloy.

687
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:41,084
He posted pictures of me

00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:15,084
This here situation,

704
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:17,353
the way you tell it,

705
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:18,951
I don't see
no good end to it.

706
00:50:18,982 --> 00:50:22,191
If it was the old days,
I'd take him out for you myself,

707
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:24,165
chuck a spear in his ass.

708
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:30,369
But I got a good woman now.
And she's in a family way.

709
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:32,965
I'm not asking you
to take him out.

710
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:34,407
I need a gun.

711
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:36,274
Oh.

712
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:38,074
I don't do guns, Molloy.
You know that.

713
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:40,741
I know,
but you know people who do.

714
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:45,786
Look, I wouldn't be asking,
but I don't know what else to do.

715
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:48,813
He got into my house
and took a videotape

716
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:51,086
of Kelly taking a shower.

717
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:55,923
And you're gonna do this
yourself?

718
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:58,193
I'm gonna do
whatever it takes, yeah.

719
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:07,432
I always liked you, Molloy.

720
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:09,740
You bailed me out of more jams
than I can count.

721
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:12,178
You always
treated me square,

722
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:15,308
like a person,
like a human being.

723
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:18,342
And that's why
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

724
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:21,356
You're out of your league
with Yates.

725
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:24,222
What, you think waving a pistol
around in his face

726
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,318
is gonna put
the fear of God in him?

727
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:28,590
It ain't gonna happen,
brother.

728
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:32,725
He ain't afraid of nothing,
and that includes God.

729
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,669
You flip the situation around,

730
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:40,300
say you were fucking with him,
getting into his shit

731
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:43,311
or sniffing around
his woman-

732
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:45,335
you'd already be dead

733
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:47,541
with your throat cut.

734
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:50,978
You ain't the man
you used to be, Molloy.

735
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:53,248
And you ain't a killer.

736
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:56,257
You ain't got it in you.

737
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,281
You know that.

738
00:51:58,315 --> 00:52:00,454
I know that.

739
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:02,987
And Yates-
he knows that too.

740
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:11,902
Can you give me a gun
or not?

741
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:23,008
- Jack: Hey, baby, you still at work?
- Yeah, I'm just closing up.

742
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:27,487
Listen, I'm gonna go out with a couple
of the guys tonight after work,

743
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:29,513
shoot some pool,
have a few laughs.

744
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:32,755
Good. Seems like you could do
with a night out.

745
00:52:32,782 --> 00:52:34,125
Kel...

746
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:40,568
Jack?

747
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:41,762
Are you there?

748
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,564
Yeah, I'm here.

749
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:47,802
I gotta go. baby-

750
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,333
Okay, love you.

751
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:53,478
- Ready?
- Yeah.

752
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:18,828
Are you sure about this?

753
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:21,770
Yeah, I'm sure.

754
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,588
Ain't much good
without these.

755
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:41,160
What do I owe you?

756
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:43,357
Maybe you can help me
get my land back.

757
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:46,299
( Both chuckle)

758
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:48,894
Thanks.
I really appreciate this.

759
00:53:48,925 --> 00:53:50,802
No worries.

760
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:57,842
Why do you think
he's doing this?

761
00:53:59,336 --> 00:54:02,806
There's spirits that take over
weaker souls like Yates-

762
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:06,252
turns them into murderers
and thieves.

763
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:09,280
There ain't no "why" to it,

764
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:11,019
no understanding it.

765
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:13,755
It's just the way it is,

766
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:16,286
the way it's always been-

767
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,321
evil.

768
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,205
Are you still gonna do this?

769
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:32,611
I'm meeting him tonight
at Elsewhere at 10:00.

770
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:34,377

00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,847
Hey.

806
00:59:40,977 --> 00:59:42,217
Kelly: Hey.

807
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,247
The truth, okay?

808
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:47,691
The truth, all of it.

809
00:59:49,385 --> 00:59:51,558
I did two stints in prison-

810
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:54,797
one for stealing a car...

811
00:59:56,492 --> 01:00:00,565
and the other one
for possession of-- of drugs.

812
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:05,703
I was doing about three grams,

813
01:00:05,735 --> 01:00:08,409
if not more, of coke

814
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:11,146
a day.

815
01:00:11,174 --> 01:00:14,087
I was taking downs
to take the edge off.

816
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:16,112
And...

817
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:19,793
I would just drink...

818
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:23,862
all day long.

819
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:33,171
I've lied.

820
01:00:33,196 --> 01:00:35,802
I've cheated.

821
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:43,115
I did about a dozen
armed robberies.

822
01:00:46,342 --> 01:00:50,085
And I never gave any of it
a second thought.

823
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:53,526
It's just what I did
back then.

824
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,321
But that's the past.

825
01:00:58,354 --> 01:01:00,800
I'm telling you, it's over.

826
01:01:02,558 --> 01:01:04,595
And I had nothing to do--

827
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:07,164
nothing to do
with the convenience store.

828
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:12,111
I was being setup,

829
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:14,775
blackmailed by Gary.

830
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:17,148
His real name is Yates.

831
01:01:20,043 --> 01:01:22,182
I'm so sorry

832
01:01:22,211 --> 01:01:24,350
that I lied to you.

833
01:01:26,482 --> 01:01:29,326
I'm--

834
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:31,354
I'm on parole.

835
01:01:31,387 --> 01:01:34,596
And I didn't--

836
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:36,865
I didn't know if they were gonna
throw me in jail

837
01:01:36,893 --> 01:01:39,806
or deport me back to the US.

838
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,609
And then

839
01:01:43,633 --> 01:01:45,635
I would never have gotten
to see you again.

840
01:01:45,668 --> 01:01:49,912
And I'm not sure if I was gonna
be able to take that.

841
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:54,477
Just go.

842
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:55,750
I'm sorry.

843
01:01:55,778 --> 01:01:59,089

( Phone ringing )

866
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:40,281
- Hello.
- You found my little surprise?

867
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:42,687
You sick motherfucker!

868
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:45,386
I take that as a yes.

869
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:47,724
Elsewhere, 10:00.

870
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:50,931
(chuckles)

871
01:04:56,926 --> 01:04:58,428
( knocking on door)

872
01:05:09,705 --> 01:05:11,616
Oh my God.

873
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,182
Hey.

874
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:21,252
Hey. Fancy seeing you.

875
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:24,060
- How are you doing?
- Well, aren't you gonna invite me in?

876
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:26,123
Yeah, I was just
on my way out.

877
01:05:26,155 --> 01:05:28,066
Kelly just called me.
She said-

878
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,592
She's not here?

879
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:31,627
No, she-- she's having
car trouble.

880
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:33,766
- So she needed me to pick--
- Hope you don't mind if I just

881
01:05:33,796 --> 01:05:35,503
come in and have
a little look around.

882
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:39,340
Yeah.

883
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:43,178
Um, you want something
to drink?

884
01:05:43,205 --> 01:05:45,151
- No, I'm good, thanks.
- Huh?

885
01:05:45,174 --> 01:05:46,812
- I'm good.
- Yeah?

886
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:52,481
I'm just surprised
to see you.

887
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:56,291
- Molloy.
- Yeah?

888
01:05:57,653 --> 01:06:00,930
I don't normally do house calls,
as you know.

889
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:04,905
I've had a call from a friend of yours,
said they're a bit concerned about you.

890
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:06,634
So here I am.

891
01:06:06,662 --> 01:06:07,902
Oh.

892
01:06:11,167 --> 01:06:13,169
Everything's fine.

893
01:06:13,202 --> 01:06:14,806
Mm-hmm.

894
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:21,521
"The Great Escape."
( chuckles )

895
01:06:21,544 --> 01:06:23,956
Yeah, it's a great movie,
a classic.

896
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,789
Yeah.

897
01:06:29,085 --> 01:06:31,224
So this is pretty much it.

898
01:06:31,253 --> 01:06:33,255
L-- I-- I gotta get Kelly.

899
01:06:33,289 --> 01:06:35,166
Like I tell you,
since I'm here,

900
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:37,068
might as well do this.

901
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:39,164
It'll take a sec.

902
01:06:39,195 --> 01:06:41,175
Yeah. Yeah.

903
01:06:41,197 --> 01:06:42,699
After you.

904
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:56,621
Um...

905
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:06,890
SO...

906
01:07:06,922 --> 01:07:09,198
(Jack coughing)

907
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,237
Excuse me.

908
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:13,968
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

909
01:07:13,996 --> 01:07:16,636
I just got a little cold,
I think.

910
01:07:16,665 --> 01:07:18,576
( Urinating )

911
01:07:19,568 --> 01:07:21,946
Drink more water
and be safe.

912
01:07:23,773 --> 01:07:25,650
There you go.

913
01:07:25,674 --> 01:07:27,210
That's good.

914
01:07:29,678 --> 01:07:31,919
(water running)

915
01:07:33,516 --> 01:07:36,019
Okay.

916
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:38,293
That's it.

917
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,095
So...

918
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:43,161
So I don't mean to be rude.

919
01:07:43,192 --> 01:07:45,263
I just gotta-

920
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:48,833
So everything's all right?

921
01:07:48,864 --> 01:07:51,140
Yeah, no, it's great.

922
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:53,875
She's-- she's all moved in.

923
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:56,509
Uh, yeah, it's--

924
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:58,450
it's great.

925
01:07:58,474 --> 01:08:01,717
Well, you know what?

926
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:03,587
I might have been wrong
about you.

927
01:08:03,612 --> 01:08:06,889
Oh, well, there's a first time
for everything, I guess.

928
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:08,418
(chuckles)
Yeah.

929
01:08:08,451 --> 01:08:10,590
Well, you just keep
out of trouble.

930
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:12,621
Okay. Thanks for stopping by.

931
01:08:12,655 --> 01:08:13,929
Yeah.

932
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:38,019
Hey.

933
01:08:39,181 --> 01:08:41,491
Shall we go talk?

934
01:08:41,517 --> 01:08:42,689
Yeah.

935
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:45,426
After you.

936
01:08:54,897 --> 01:08:57,104
Where are we going, matey?

937
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:59,545
Oh. Whoo-hoo-hoo!

938
01:08:59,568 --> 01:09:01,172
Don't move.

939
01:09:01,203 --> 01:09:04,741
Don't move. Don't move.

940
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:09,953
I told you to stay away
from us, didn't I?

941
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:11,981
You did. You did.
(chuckles)

942
01:09:13,516 --> 01:09:15,427
You think it's fucking funny?

943
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:18,364
Yes, I do.
( laughing )

944
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:21,095
You fuck with me--
that's fine.

945
01:09:21,123 --> 01:09:24,764
Whatever you got,
I can take.

946
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:27,433
But you fuck with her,
you fuck with Kelly--

947
01:09:27,463 --> 01:09:30,000
that I'm not gonna take.
That I won't take.

948
01:09:30,032 --> 01:09:32,034
And what you did to Bear,
motherfucker-

949
01:09:32,067 --> 01:09:34,308
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Don't put your fucking hand out.

950
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:36,407
Bear came at me, partner.

951
01:09:36,438 --> 01:09:37,940
- Get out!
-( alarm ringing)

952
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:02,070
( door slams )

953

(distant siren wailing)

954
01:11:33,822 --> 01:11:36,132
Oh. ( laughing)

955
01:11:44,266 --> 01:11:45,939
Come on, you.

956
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:50,948
(coughing )

957
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:01,327
Well, go on, shoot me.

958
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:02,886
Shoot me.

959
01:12:02,918 --> 01:12:04,727
Not yet, partner.

960
01:12:04,753 --> 01:12:07,131
We still have
one more job to pull.

961
01:12:20,102 --> 01:12:22,514
(cell phone ringing )

962
01:12:30,612 --> 01:12:32,114
Oh, fuck.

963
01:12:34,717 --> 01:12:36,719
(groaning )

964
01:12:39,722 --> 01:12:41,099
Yeah, hello.

965
01:12:41,123 --> 01:12:43,603
Yates:
Did you have a nice nap?

966
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:46,003
I've got one more
surprise for you.

967
01:12:47,329 --> 01:12:49,138
Meet me in 20 minutes,

968
01:12:49,164 --> 01:12:51,576
305 Surf Parade.

969
01:13:10,185 --> 01:13:12,187
( Tires screech )

970
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:31,878
You're so fucking
predictable, man.

971
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:36,382
Shut the blinds.

972
01:13:57,332 --> 01:14:00,211
You four, over there.

973
01:14:00,235 --> 01:14:01,543
Come on.

974
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:03,709
Hey, you don't need them.
Just leave them alone. Let them go.

975
01:14:03,739 --> 01:14:06,117
- Shut up!
- Just let them go.

976
01:14:07,309 --> 01:14:08,947
On the floor.

977
01:14:08,977 --> 01:14:11,014
Hands behind your head.

978
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:14,622
Get down!

979
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:16,254
(women scream )

980
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:18,060
Feels good, doesn't it?

981
01:14:28,597 --> 01:14:29,701
(women scream )

982
01:14:31,366 --> 01:14:33,676
(women whimpering )

983
01:14:33,702 --> 01:14:35,841
Come on, fill them up.

984
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:46,956
I'm sorry.
It's gonna be okay.

985
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:52,695
(women scream )

986
01:14:57,893 --> 01:14:59,895
We're getting close, mate-

987
01:15:00,929 --> 01:15:02,931
end of your life.

988
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:05,943
It's called karma.

989
01:15:05,968 --> 01:15:08,278
(Jack groaning)

990
01:15:08,303 --> 01:15:10,476
And as usual,

991
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:13,544
you're bringing someone
with you.

992
01:15:13,575 --> 01:15:15,521
(women scream )

993
01:15:18,146 --> 01:15:20,353
Excuse me.
What are you doing?

994
01:15:21,617 --> 01:15:23,756
Fill them up.
Come on.

995
01:15:32,427 --> 01:15:33,804
You looking for these?

996
01:15:38,433 --> 01:15:40,811
Give him his pills.

997
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:42,816
Back room now, come on.

998
01:15:42,838 --> 01:15:44,681
Come on, open the safe.
Let's go.

999
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:49,783
Now be quiet.

1000
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:54,757
All right, come on.
Hurry up, open it.

1001
01:15:57,786 --> 01:16:00,027
Good girl.

1002
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:01,557
(whimpers)

1003
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:03,934
Are you fucking with me?

1004
01:16:03,959 --> 01:16:06,030
- No. Just--
- You'd better not.

1005
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:08,371
Just-- just hold on, okay?

1006
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:09,899
I'll get it.

1007
01:16:13,969 --> 01:16:16,449
(woman whimpering )

1008
01:16:23,712 --> 01:16:24,884
Hey.

1009
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:29,555
Shh. Shh.

1010
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:33,066
- Here you go, mate.
-( pills rattling)

1011
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:34,863
Kelly:
Why are you doing this?

1012
01:16:37,225 --> 01:16:40,331
He stole my fucking life.

1013
01:16:41,363 --> 01:16:43,309
You understand?

1014
01:16:43,332 --> 01:16:46,404
Three years
in a fucking cell.

1015
01:16:49,171 --> 01:16:51,742
And he's out here with you,

1016
01:16:51,773 --> 01:16:54,014
shacked up with Miss-

1017
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:55,544
Miss April.

1018
01:16:57,646 --> 01:17:00,650
It's not fair,

1019
01:17:00,682 --> 01:17:02,184
not in my world.

1020
01:17:08,523 --> 01:17:10,366
You should have been
there, mate.

1021
01:17:10,392 --> 01:17:13,669
I was busy being dead.

1022
01:17:13,695 --> 01:17:15,902
Then you should have
stayed there.

1023
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:20,209
Ladies before gentlemen.

1024
01:17:20,235 --> 01:17:21,236
( Gasps )

1025
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:23,078
(screams)

1026
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:24,607
Oy!

1027
01:17:43,759 --> 01:17:46,137
Oh. Oh.

1028
01:18:01,076 --> 01:18:03,078
(groaning )

1029
01:18:06,481 --> 01:18:09,018
- I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry.
- Just hold on.

1030
01:18:17,959 --> 01:18:19,632
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't be silly.

1031
01:18:19,661 --> 01:18:22,301
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, Kelly.

1032
01:18:24,566 --> 01:18:26,739
You have to get out of here.
Come on, Jack.

1033
01:18:26,768 --> 01:18:28,406
Come on.

1034
01:18:29,504 --> 01:18:31,848
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

1035
01:18:35,043 --> 01:18:36,886
The 9'-IV"

1036
01:18:36,912 --> 01:18:41,054
the guy that did all those things
back then,

1037
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:44,496
the guy
with the death wish--

1038
01:18:44,519 --> 01:18:47,193
he got his wish, Kelly.

1039
01:18:49,424 --> 01:18:51,426
He had a heart attack

1040
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:52,905
and died.

1041
01:18:53,995 --> 01:18:56,373
He doesn't exist anymore.

1042
01:18:57,833 --> 01:19:00,439
And the guy

1043
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:03,507
that you're looking at now--

1044
01:19:03,538 --> 01:19:08,078
the guy
with the nine-to-five job,

1045
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:11,023
lives in a two-bedder,

1046
01:19:11,046 --> 01:19:14,050
loves Thai takeaway...

1047
01:19:16,151 --> 01:19:19,132
loves when his girlfriend
talks dirty to him...

1048
01:19:19,154 --> 01:19:21,657
( both chuckle)

1049
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:24,603
...the way she smiles.

1050
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:31,669
He loves everything
about her.

1051
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:35,807
And whatever happens
with us,

1052
01:19:35,837 --> 01:19:38,249
that's enough.

1053
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:42,285
Okay?
