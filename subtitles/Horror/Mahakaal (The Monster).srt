1
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,218
I aIways wanted to be
in the movies

2
00:00:27,454 --> 00:00:33,415
When I was IittIe I thought for sure
1 day, I couId be a big big star...

3
00:00:33,593 --> 00:00:35,686
Or maybe just beautifuI...

4
00:00:35,895 --> 00:00:39,262
BeautifuI and rich,
Iike the women on TV

5
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:42,558
Yeah, I had a Iot of dreams

6
00:00:42,702 --> 00:00:45,193
And I guess you can
caII me a reaI romantic

7
00:00:45,338 --> 00:00:49,035
Because I truIy beIieve that
one day...they'II come true

8
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:51,934
So I dream about it for hours

9
00:00:52,112 --> 00:00:55,782
As the years went by,
I Iearnt to stop sharing this with people

10
00:00:55,782 --> 00:00:57,374
They said I was dreaming

11
00:00:57,484 --> 00:01:01,215
But back then, I beIieved
it whoIe heartiIy

12
00:01:01,488 --> 00:01:05,015
So whenever I was down,
I would just escape into my mind

13
00:01:05,358 --> 00:01:08,384
To my other Iive, where
I was someone eIse

14
00:01:08,561 --> 00:01:10,756
It made me happy to think
that aII these peopIe...

15
00:01:10,897 --> 00:01:13,297
just didn't know yet
who I was gonna be

16
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,230
But 1 day they'II aII see

17
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:19,370
I heard that MariIyn Monroe
was discovered in a soda shop

18
00:01:19,406 --> 00:01:21,601
And I thought for sure,
it couId be Iike that

19
00:01:21,775 --> 00:01:23,640
So I started growing up
reaI young...

20
00:01:23,843 --> 00:01:27,904
And I aIways secretIy Iooking
for who is gonna discover me?

21
00:01:28,047 --> 00:01:29,878
Was it this guy?

22
00:01:32,385 --> 00:01:33,909
Or maybe this one?

23
00:01:34,587 --> 00:01:36,054
You never knew

24
00:01:36,923 --> 00:01:40,381
But even if they couIdn't take me
aII the way ... Iike MariIyn

25
00:01:40,493 --> 00:01:43,223
They wouId somehow
beIieve in me just enough

26
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:48,460
They wouId see me for what I couId
be, and think I was beautifuI

27
00:01:50,537 --> 00:01:52,732
Like a diamond in the rough

28
00:01:53,807 --> 00:01:55,798
They'II take me away...

29
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:57,467
To my new Iife

30
00:01:57,677 --> 00:01:59,736
And my new worId

31
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:02,006
Where everything
would be different

32
00:02:05,552 --> 00:02:10,888
Yeah, I Iived that way
for Iong Iong time

33
00:02:11,124 --> 00:02:14,890
And my head dreaming
Iike that

34
00:02:14,961 --> 00:02:16,553
It was nice

35
00:02:16,729 --> 00:02:18,594
1 day it just stopped

36
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,609
By the time I met
you aII...

37
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:43,455
Shame...
aII I want is a beer

38
00:02:59,472 --> 00:03:01,463
How are you doing?
-Great

39
00:03:01,508 --> 00:03:02,634
Anyone sitting here?

40
00:03:02,742 --> 00:03:04,209
No

41
00:03:26,432 --> 00:03:29,401
Madam our services
are for patrons onIy

42
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,503
Give me a beer
whatever cheapest

43
00:03:37,544 --> 00:03:40,411
So what it is Iike,
a gay pIace or what?

44
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,409
Yeah

45
00:03:44,017 --> 00:03:45,609
Hey, whatever, man

46
00:04:08,808 --> 00:04:10,742
Can I buy you that drink?

47
00:04:10,877 --> 00:04:12,640
I got my own money

48
00:04:15,615 --> 00:04:19,016
I'II have a pitcher, whatever
she's having

49
00:04:21,087 --> 00:04:22,987
Look, I'm not gay aIrite?

50
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:26,554
Well, it makes sense

51
00:04:26,593 --> 00:04:27,958
So what are you doing
here then?

52
00:04:28,127 --> 00:04:30,027
My truck broke down, I'm a ...

53
00:04:31,564 --> 00:04:33,657
I got a pressure cIeaning
business

54
00:04:33,766 --> 00:04:35,165
What's pressure cIeaning?

55
00:04:35,335 --> 00:04:37,132
You know steam cIean?

56
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,037

00:06:42,628 --> 00:06:44,892
The bar is cIosed

93
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,159
Then why don't you take
that stick out of your ass...

00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:59,367
What you do for is that?

97
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,308
We had a good time

98
00:07:05,485 --> 00:07:08,181
Yeah, I know, it was fun

99
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,084
I'm sorry, I caIIed you
dumb dyke

100
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,653

00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,087
And thanks for the drinks

102
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,857
No...No Problem.

103
00:07:19,232 --> 00:07:20,460
So see you around ok

104
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:22,056
Do you wanna stay with
me?

105
00:07:22,735 --> 00:07:25,966
I didn't mean....you know
you don't have to do anything

106
00:07:26,205 --> 00:07:27,934
Shit I know

107
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:33,677
Fuck it

108
00:07:33,946 --> 00:07:36,608
Yeah? My truck's
broken down

109
00:07:37,617 --> 00:07:42,111
Ok, car's over here,
come here, this way

110
00:07:45,124 --> 00:07:47,092
AII I wanted was a beer

111
00:07:47,293 --> 00:07:51,423
But the day I met SeIby I'd spent
most of the afternoon sitting in the rain,
about to kiII myseIf

112
00:07:51,631 --> 00:07:52,825
So you can understand

113
00:07:52,932 --> 00:07:57,301
I was fIexibIe, I mean everybody
gotta have faith in something

114
00:07:57,436 --> 00:08:00,530
For me? For me aII I had Ieft
was Iove

115
00:08:00,673 --> 00:08:02,868
And I was getting pretty sure that,
I wasn't gonna Iove a man again

116
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:04,475
So I was gonna do it

117
00:08:04,777 --> 00:08:07,644
And the onIy reason I did it
was a five doIIar biII

118
00:08:07,847 --> 00:08:10,441
I knew I probabIy given some
asshoIe a bIowjob for it

119
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:14,484
So reaIIy tried to piss me off that
if I kiIIed myseIf without spending it

120
00:08:14,654 --> 00:08:16,884
BasicaIIy I sucked
him off for free

121
00:08:17,023 --> 00:08:18,547
So I made a deaI

122
00:08:18,691 --> 00:08:20,989
I said God, I gotta spend
this 5 bucks

123
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:22,788
But when it's gone
so am I

124
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,331
If you've got something for me
in this life, you better bring it on

125
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,563
And there she was

126
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:36,673
Just some friends my parents
and I are staying with

127
00:08:40,746 --> 00:08:43,146
You wanna take a shower
or anything?

128
00:09:10,877 --> 00:09:13,846
Goodnite
-Goodnite

129
00:09:34,267 --> 00:09:36,235

are here

130
00:09:38,237 --> 00:09:39,704
Me neither

131
00:09:46,012 --> 00:09:48,105
Can I touch your face?

132
00:09:54,754 --> 00:09:56,449
Sure

133
00:10:25,418 --> 00:10:26,578
Honey!

134
00:10:29,255 --> 00:10:33,419
God Donna!
Donna sorry, just a sec!

135
00:10:36,362 --> 00:10:38,796
I'm sorry, I'm supposed
to be ready for church

136
00:10:40,866 --> 00:10:42,356
Hey, where's my shirt?

137
00:10:45,438 --> 00:10:49,067
Look at this, it's 5 o'cIock in
the morning and she ain't dressed yet

138
00:10:52,445 --> 00:10:53,946
I'm sorry about that

139
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:55,311
No, it's aIrite

140
00:10:55,514 --> 00:10:57,175
Hey thanks for letting me crash

141
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,015
No, that was nice

142
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,382
So when are you Ieaving?

143
00:11:06,492 --> 00:11:07,823

00:11:07,994 --> 00:11:12,328
But you know, I'm gonna be hanging out

145
00:11:13,366 --> 00:11:15,857

-Yeah yeah yeah

146
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:18,398

You have fun at church,

149
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,553
Who was that person?

150
00:11:36,055 --> 00:11:38,023
She's just a friend I made

151
00:11:38,157 --> 00:11:41,126
Honey, I think she was a
straight person

152
00:11:41,527 --> 00:11:44,519
Did you check your stuff,
because she might have stole something

153
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:49,294
No...I checked it, she didn't
take anything

154
00:11:49,468 --> 00:11:54,929
Listen, honey, you cannot bring peopIe
like that here, what if Charles had seen her?

155
00:11:55,508 --> 00:11:56,907
I'm sorry

156
00:11:57,043 --> 00:12:00,535
A person Iike that ... no Mdm

157
00:12:01,113 --> 00:12:03,946
We have no business with
peopIe Iike that

158
00:12:16,295 --> 00:12:18,229

196
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:16,238
Well, how about that guy?

00:15:23,349 --> 00:15:24,680

202
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,727
Well he, he's straight up, S&M

203
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:42,367
That's Trevor,
That's the son of the people I'm staying with

204
00:15:42,534 --> 00:15:44,001
Shit I'm sorry

205
00:15:44,136 --> 00:15:45,728
I don't care about that

206
00:15:47,273 --> 00:15:49,764
I don't reaIise he was gonna
be here

207
00:15:57,783 --> 00:16:02,584
This girl in my church, she toId
everyone that I tried to kiss her

208
00:16:02,721 --> 00:16:05,019
So my parents
basically disowned me

209
00:16:05,157 --> 00:16:08,752
And I decided to come down here
and try to figure somethings out

210
00:16:08,827 --> 00:16:10,988
Then this happened
before I could get a job

211
00:16:13,032 --> 00:16:15,000
How Iong do you have to stay on?

212
00:16:15,134 --> 00:16:17,034
Not too much Ionger

213
00:16:17,403 --> 00:16:20,167
But my dad had to pay my medicaI biIIs

214
00:16:20,372 --> 00:16:23,432
So I made a deaI with him,
that I would go back

215
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:29,570
Which ...you know...it...probabIy
for the best...maybe it'll work

216
00:16:29,715 --> 00:16:34,880
Maybe he'II be able to save my
souI and aII that

217
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:41,389
WeII I bet you twenty, I'II beat

218
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:43,355

00:16:52,171 --> 00:16:53,035

Do you wanna die?

318
00:27:53,331 --> 00:27:55,561
Do you wanna fucking die?

319
00:27:55,967 --> 00:27:57,958

323
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,578
Sorry it was me

324
00:30:28,686 --> 00:30:29,778

00:30:30,221 --> 00:30:32,849
No, it's me I feII out of bed

326
00:30:40,298 --> 00:30:42,163
If that woman's in here, Selby, so help me god ..

327
00:30:44,903 --> 00:30:49,636

don't appreciate what he toId me

328
00:30:49,841 --> 00:30:51,968
I don't think your father

329
00:30:53,444 --> 00:30:56,902
If she's in here, I want you
to get her out rite now!

330
00:30:57,782 --> 00:31:00,342
Or Charlie bound to bIow

331
00:31:13,364 --> 00:31:14,626
What the heII are
you doing here?

332
00:31:17,535 --> 00:31:19,867
No man, I just wanted to see you

333
00:31:27,078 --> 00:31:28,773
I got in a fight

334
00:31:29,347 --> 00:31:31,178
It must have been a really Iong fight

335
00:31:31,316 --> 00:31:34,183
I got a man reaIIy
beaten me up, ok

336
00:31:37,488 --> 00:31:39,683
It wasn't my fauIt

337
00:31:44,262 --> 00:31:46,025
Are you ok?

338
00:31:53,504 --> 00:31:55,267
But it's cooI now

339
00:31:55,907 --> 00:31:57,738
It's cooI

340
00:31:58,076 --> 00:31:59,771
I was thinking...

341
00:32:00,812 --> 00:32:03,440
You know I want you to
stay a IittIe Ionger

342
00:32:04,482 --> 00:32:06,317
Cause I can't

343
00:32:06,317 --> 00:32:07,375
Why not?

344
00:32:07,485 --> 00:32:10,147
Cause I toId you

345
00:32:11,656 --> 00:32:16,218

346
00:32:16,261 --> 00:32:19,753

348
00:32:33,578 --> 00:32:36,479
I was goona use it to take you

349
00:32:37,248 --> 00:32:40,183
That's enough to rent
a hoteI for whoIe week

350
00:32:40,385 --> 00:32:44,617
We can party, hang out,
whatever you wanna do, you know

351
00:32:48,893 --> 00:32:50,793
Maybe I can come back

352
00:32:54,966 --> 00:32:59,164
No, you can't come back

353
00:32:59,537 --> 00:33:01,630
Cause I'II be gone

354
00:33:10,481 --> 00:33:12,142

Oh My God SeIby!

367
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:52,700

I found a roomate and...

376
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,861
I can't dad

377
00:37:25,036 --> 00:37:27,436
I'm not even staying
here anymore

378
00:37:30,174 --> 00:37:36,079
I just came by to pick up some stuff,
I'm not even staying at Donna's anymore

379
00:37:45,923 --> 00:37:50,417
Ok..ok..I'm an aduIt now,

380
00:37:51,062 --> 00:37:53,929
And I gotta go

381
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:56,826
What are you doing?

382
00:37:57,635 --> 00:38:02,334
She's not even...gay

383
00:38:02,473 --> 00:38:06,705
She's just some old street
hooker, she's just using you

384
00:38:15,586 --> 00:38:16,883
I quit

385
00:38:17,455 --> 00:38:18,683
What?

386
00:38:20,257 --> 00:38:21,986
What're your bags doing here?

387
00:38:22,093 --> 00:38:23,617
I'm staying

388
00:38:25,329 --> 00:38:28,594
HoIy shit girI, you just
made my day

389
00:38:30,034 --> 00:38:31,331
How did you get them huh?

390
00:38:31,502 --> 00:38:33,231
I took a cab

391
00:38:34,338 --> 00:38:36,363
But Leen, you can take care
of me rite? cause...

392
00:38:36,507 --> 00:38:38,475
I've spent aII our money

393
00:38:41,979 --> 00:38:43,640
It don't even matter

394
00:38:43,981 --> 00:38:45,915
What you said?
You quit?

395
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:48,745
Hooking...I quit hooking

396
00:38:48,919 --> 00:38:50,113
Why?

397
00:38:50,655 --> 00:38:53,749
Why? because it's shit, it's time man,
I fucking hate it

398
00:38:54,191 --> 00:38:55,681
I thought you said
it wasn't that bad

399
00:38:55,826 --> 00:38:59,091
Oh..it is, you know, but,
not aIways, it's not the point

400
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,925
I got you now

401
00:39:01,132 --> 00:39:03,225
I got everything going for me

402
00:39:04,068 --> 00:39:05,626
So I'm gonna do a broiI

403
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:08,136
This time I'm doing
it a broiI

404
00:39:08,205 --> 00:39:09,331
How about that?

405
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,336
Fine, but what are you
gonna do about work?

406
00:39:12,643 --> 00:39:15,407
ExactIy....I'll get a job

407
00:39:15,546 --> 00:39:20,176
Go cIean...straighten up, you know,
fuck it, man, I'II get a career

408
00:39:20,985 --> 00:39:26,252
House, car...you know,
how about that

409
00:39:27,758 --> 00:39:30,124
What kind of job are
you gonna get?

410
00:39:30,428 --> 00:39:32,589
I've been thinking
about that

411
00:39:33,831 --> 00:39:36,231
I was thinking maybe like
a veterinarian, you know

412
00:39:36,367 --> 00:39:38,335
Cos I fucking Iove animaIs,
you know

413
00:39:38,436 --> 00:39:40,028
Yeah...

414
00:39:40,304 --> 00:39:44,434
But that's a doctor...
you gotta get a degree for that

415
00:39:45,409 --> 00:39:49,869
No, I'm not, no

416
00:39:50,748 --> 00:39:54,616
Shit, I know, you know
what I always wanted to be?

417
00:39:54,752 --> 00:39:56,219
What?

418
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,754
President of the US

419
00:40:14,405 --> 00:40:17,238
I just haven't been feeIing too good
Iately, you know

420
00:40:20,745 --> 00:40:22,372
But I will though, man

421
00:40:23,047 --> 00:40:24,844
I'II be feeIing great

422
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,578
It's fucking
ceIebration time

423
00:40:33,457 --> 00:40:37,018
Oh yes this is...
this is big

424
00:40:37,161 --> 00:40:40,392
I once heard this thing that
aIways stuck with me

425
00:40:40,731 --> 00:40:41,959
I must've been around
13 years oId

426
00:40:42,133 --> 00:40:45,330
Cause I remember I just
put the baby up for adoption

427
00:40:45,503 --> 00:40:47,494
They caII the assembIy
of my junior high

428
00:40:47,638 --> 00:40:49,765
Cause this guy who pIayed
drum for certain workmen...

429
00:40:49,974 --> 00:40:51,737
Was coming to taIk to
us about success...

430
00:40:51,876 --> 00:40:54,242
and making your mark
on the worId

431
00:40:54,645 --> 00:40:58,103
I don't have any experience,
per se...

432
00:40:58,249 --> 00:41:01,514
I'm a reaI...I mean
I'm a reaI hard worker

433
00:41:01,685 --> 00:41:04,882
I was real excited, cause he was
the 1st reaI ceIebrity I've seen...

434
00:41:05,156 --> 00:41:06,953
And this was exactIy the
kind of thing I wanted to Iearn...

435
00:41:07,057 --> 00:41:08,854
How to foIIow in the
footsteps of ...

436
00:41:09,059 --> 00:41:10,219
I don't even write it
down, you know

437
00:41:10,361 --> 00:41:11,988
Just stay rite...
just stay rite there

438
00:41:12,196 --> 00:41:15,427
And you shouId know that
I've worked with peopIe aII my Iife

439
00:41:15,766 --> 00:41:18,462
So I'm reaI good with
peopIe and...

440
00:41:19,403 --> 00:41:21,803
I know how to work the roledex

441
00:41:22,006 --> 00:41:23,667
So I Iisten reaI hard to any advice he had

442
00:41:25,209 --> 00:41:28,645
For sure he said something
that stuck rite in my reaI mind

443
00:41:28,779 --> 00:41:31,942
It was aII you need in
Iife...is Iove

444
00:41:32,082 --> 00:41:33,481
And to beIieve in
yourseIf

445
00:41:33,784 --> 00:41:35,718
then there's nothing you can't do

446
00:41:38,656 --> 00:41:40,920
To make sure that i have aII
this straight

447
00:41:41,091 --> 00:41:44,492
BasicaIIy, you've no experience,
no coIIege degree...

448
00:41:44,628 --> 00:41:47,392
No resume, no work history
what-so-ever in fact

449
00:41:47,531 --> 00:41:49,965
And now you wouId
Iike to be...a Iawyer

450
00:41:50,568 --> 00:41:54,334
No, see...I'm sorry,
but when I read the ad...

451
00:41:54,471 --> 00:41:56,336
It said you were Iooking
for a secretary

452
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,204
Ok, weII you need to
Iearn how to type...

453
00:41:59,343 --> 00:42:00,935
You'll need computer skiIIs

454
00:42:01,078 --> 00:42:02,875
Most of our secretaries
have coIIege degree

455
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:06,040
Infact most of them have
speciaIised in Iaw

456
00:42:06,183 --> 00:42:10,711
I don't mean to sound harsh, but
frankIy this is a IittIe insuIting

457
00:42:13,157 --> 00:42:14,920
AII that Iooks great,
It must be wonderfuI, but...

458
00:42:15,059 --> 00:42:16,356
Can I teII you something?

459
00:42:16,527 --> 00:42:20,088
When the beach party is over, you
don't get to say, you know what

460
00:42:20,264 --> 00:42:23,324
I think now I would Iike to have what everybody
eIse has worked their entire Iife for...

461
00:42:23,434 --> 00:42:25,026
It doesn't work that way

462
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:27,835
Fuck you, man!

463
00:42:28,005 --> 00:42:29,336
Yeah fuck you!

464
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,374
You don't fucking
know me

465
00:42:31,475 --> 00:42:33,568
Ok, great, that's great, see?

466
00:42:33,711 --> 00:42:38,478
Now I'm so sorry I didn't hire you before.
LesIie couId you pIease escort miss...

467
00:42:38,582 --> 00:42:41,346
I don't even know her name, because of course
she doesn't have a resume...

468
00:42:41,452 --> 00:42:43,977
No need, you fucking asshoIe,
you piece of shit

469
00:42:44,121 --> 00:42:46,055
What you think I'm
fucking retard?

470
00:42:47,224 --> 00:42:48,691

473
00:42:56,867 --> 00:43:01,099
Nice idea, it doesn't exactIy
work out that way

474
00:43:01,238 --> 00:43:05,231
But I guess it was better to hear
flat out lying then to know the truth at thirteen

475
00:43:09,146 --> 00:43:13,412
Fuck this phoney shit, told him to fuck himself,

478
00:43:20,424 --> 00:43:21,914
Not a fucking thing

479
00:43:22,426 --> 00:43:24,792
Not one fucking thing

480
00:43:24,995 --> 00:43:25,927
Stupid mother fucker

481
00:43:26,096 --> 00:43:28,656
I've bet nobody fucking ever taIked
to him Iike that in his whoIe Iife

482
00:43:28,799 --> 00:43:31,962
Fucking office job, who the

483
00:43:32,102 --> 00:43:33,437
You gotta fucking sitting

00:43:33,437 --> 00:43:34,369
You got your IittIe phone...

485
00:43:34,505 --> 00:43:36,302
You got your piece of paper,
your IittIe pen...

486
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,169
You write shit down,
bIa bIa bIa

487
00:43:38,242 --> 00:43:41,439
Fucking a monkey can
do that shit, man, fuck!

488
00:43:41,745 --> 00:43:43,440
I thought you wanted a
job Iike that

489
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,172
You know what?

490
00:43:45,349 --> 00:43:47,510
No. Toby, 2 more

491
00:43:48,385 --> 00:43:51,354
Honey, AI says I can't give you
any tab

492
00:43:51,455 --> 00:43:54,959
Toby, how Iong have I
been the customer here?

493
00:43:54,959 --> 00:43:56,688
Would you cut me some

494
00:43:58,095 --> 00:44:00,120

Fucking Iazy bastard,

496
00:44:05,769 --> 00:44:08,260
Al runs a tab aII the time

497
00:44:08,405 --> 00:44:10,305
he just probabIy doesn't
know it

498
00:44:10,441 --> 00:44:13,376
Leen, what are you
gonna do?

499
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:15,842
I got it on fucking
controI, man

500
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:22,074
I'm kind of starving here

501
00:44:26,423 --> 00:44:29,392
There's no way, you could
maybe ah...

502
00:44:30,394 --> 00:44:32,555
I don't know, caII your
dad or...

503
00:44:33,197 --> 00:44:39,261
Yeah I know I know,

504
00:44:41,338 --> 00:44:44,501
Fuck it, man, I got shit

505
00:44:45,642 --> 00:44:47,872
It's not a fucking big deaI

506
00:44:51,348 --> 00:44:53,475
Can I just give it to
you straight

507
00:44:54,551 --> 00:44:57,213
The truth is,
I'm...I'm a hooker

508
00:44:57,488 --> 00:44:59,547
I'm trying to cIean my Iife up
here, you know...

509
00:44:59,723 --> 00:45:01,987
Go straight and questions
and aII, so...

510
00:45:02,126 --> 00:45:05,152
If there's any Iink that you
can heIp me with...

511
00:45:08,365 --> 00:45:10,333
That's because I was...
-That's not even matter gonna matter

512
00:45:10,501 --> 00:45:11,535
Because the best you're gonna get is
factory work

513
00:45:11,535 --> 00:45:14,197
Hey Todd, do we even have any
factory work?

514
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:16,161
Fuck!

515
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:19,407
I'm sorry, I'm just trying
to taIk to you here ...

516
00:45:25,883 --> 00:45:28,044
You don't have any
change, do you?

517
00:45:48,172 --> 00:45:51,039
Madam, I'm afraid I've to
ask you to come with me

518
00:45:51,275 --> 00:45:52,537
Why?

519
00:45:52,776 --> 00:45:54,767
Well we've had some compIains
out here, so ...

520
00:45:58,148 --> 00:46:00,309
So what they compIained about?

521
00:46:00,517 --> 00:46:04,078
Cause I just got out,
it's my day off

522
00:46:04,788 --> 00:46:06,653
A day off?

523
00:46:07,324 --> 00:46:11,192
And what's a day off for a
whore, you go to church or something?

524
00:46:25,642 --> 00:46:27,507
Don't you remember me?

525
00:46:27,611 --> 00:46:29,272
No

526
00:46:30,314 --> 00:46:33,249
I busted you not eight months ago for
tricking up on 95

527
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,216
It seems to me you might
owe me one

528
00:46:40,557 --> 00:46:42,855
Yeah, you sure went easy
on me

529
00:46:44,094 --> 00:46:45,789
You aImost broke my
fucking jaw

530
00:46:45,996 --> 00:46:48,430
PIease, you do time

531
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,165
Climb over

532
00:47:36,513 --> 00:47:37,775
SeI?

533
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:41,340
SeIby?

534
00:47:42,052 --> 00:47:45,681
SeIby? Jeses Christ,
what're you doing

535
00:47:45,756 --> 00:47:47,155
What the fuck are you doing?

536
00:47:51,161 --> 00:47:52,287
PIease drop the fucking bIade

537
00:47:52,396 --> 00:47:54,296
I take you to a fucking
doctor, ok

538
00:47:54,464 --> 00:47:55,863
Just stop it

539
00:48:00,204 --> 00:48:02,104
What are you taIking about?

540
00:48:02,339 --> 00:48:03,431
You can stop Leen.

541
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:04,472
Stop what?

542
00:48:04,608 --> 00:48:06,439
You can stop the game

543
00:48:07,177 --> 00:48:10,237
I'm out there trying
my best, ok?

544
00:48:10,414 --> 00:48:12,382
Why did you quit
hooking?

545
00:48:12,816 --> 00:48:16,513
Cause I needed to,
aIrite?

546
00:48:16,653 --> 00:48:19,019
Because you thought I was stupid,
enough to support you?

547
00:48:19,122 --> 00:48:20,555
No, SeIby

548
00:48:20,691 --> 00:48:22,488
That you wouldn't even
have to fuck me to get it

549
00:48:22,626 --> 00:48:23,615
Because I'm so hard-up

550
00:48:23,727 --> 00:48:25,786
No! no! SeIby, that's
not the reason

551
00:48:25,896 --> 00:48:28,057
You said we were gonna
party, party, party...

552
00:48:28,198 --> 00:48:29,961
Well there hasn't been a fucking party!

553
00:48:32,402 --> 00:48:35,337
Nothing! when I toId you
that I'm starving

554
00:48:36,707 --> 00:48:38,572
Cause you're using me
-No! I just...

555
00:48:40,077 --> 00:48:42,739
Because I fucking kiIIed
someone, aIrite?

556
00:48:49,686 --> 00:48:52,985
My Iast john, aIrite,
I fucking kiIIed my Iast john

557
00:48:53,156 --> 00:48:55,954
I was raped and beat to
fuck and was gonna get kiIIed

558
00:48:56,126 --> 00:48:58,651
But I won't...I didn't wanna
Iose you, you know...

559
00:48:58,762 --> 00:49:00,559
All I could think about was that for the rest of
your fucking Iife

560
00:49:02,266 --> 00:49:05,429
And you never know that
I fucking meant to be there

561
00:49:05,969 --> 00:49:08,802
I didn't wanna die,
thinking that maybe

562
00:49:09,373 --> 00:49:11,398
Maybe you couId love me

563
00:49:12,609 --> 00:49:14,668
So I kiIIed him

564
00:49:15,078 --> 00:49:21,347
I shot him, aIrite...
I fucking shot him

565
00:49:28,959 --> 00:49:31,427
I'm sorry, I Iet you
fucking down aIrite

566
00:49:31,561 --> 00:49:34,359
Now, you know me Sel,
now you fucking know me aIrite

567
00:49:38,935 --> 00:49:40,300
No, I don't wanna go

568
00:49:40,504 --> 00:49:42,529
Sure you do,
sure you fucking do!

569
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:46,200
Leave me fun,
Ieave me fucking fun!

570
00:49:52,616 --> 00:49:54,413
I'm sorry

571
00:50:25,615 --> 00:50:27,515
I know...

572
00:50:28,685 --> 00:50:30,744
He would have killed kiIIed you

573
00:50:47,037 --> 00:50:48,698
I need to get this taken off and
I'm gonna get a job

574
00:50:51,174 --> 00:50:54,974
No, I understand that
if you can't get a work

575
00:50:55,245 --> 00:50:57,042
I don't even mind

576
00:51:00,217 --> 00:51:03,709
I wanted to go back before
it was just...so shit scared of getting caught

577
00:51:03,854 --> 00:51:06,084
You know that was the
onIy reason

578
00:51:12,896 --> 00:51:14,796
I'm a hooker

579
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:48,122
You got a wet pussy?

580
00:51:50,934 --> 00:51:52,765
Yes, sure

581
00:51:53,937 --> 00:51:55,529
You Iike to fuck?

582
00:51:58,742 --> 00:52:00,175
Yup

583
00:52:02,112 --> 00:52:06,549
Jesus Christ, you'll think nobody
ever taIked dirty to you before

584
00:52:08,952 --> 00:52:11,785
I just Iike to settle
first, you know

585
00:52:15,158 --> 00:52:17,683
CaII me daddy,
whiIe I fuck you

586
00:52:18,428 --> 00:52:21,329
I try, what you Iike
to fuck your kids?

587
00:52:21,965 --> 00:52:32,705
What? I'm just kidding
with you

588
00:52:33,443 --> 00:52:35,343
I'm just messing with you

589
00:52:36,213 --> 00:52:38,204
I'II caII you daddy

590
00:52:38,882 --> 00:52:40,713

591
00:52:40,851 --> 00:52:42,443
See, I'm caIIing you daddy

592
00:52:42,486 --> 00:52:44,181

593
00:52:46,923 --> 00:52:48,151
$20 huh?

594
00:52:48,658 --> 00:52:50,455
Yup

595
00:52:53,396 --> 00:52:55,296
Some good shit here!

596
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:06,531
Come on, you wanna suck it for me

597
00:53:09,312 --> 00:53:10,779
Come on baby

598
00:54:27,791 --> 00:54:31,192
Life is funny...it's hard

599
00:54:31,661 --> 00:54:35,825
But it's aIso strange, how things can
be so different than you think

600
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,663
I remember I was just a
kid in before age cIub...

601
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:46,140
Set up this beautifuI gigantic red and yellow ferris
wheeI. It Iit up to nite sky

602
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:50,143
They caIIed it....the Monster

603
00:54:52,148 --> 00:54:53,410
You want some money?

604
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:59,345
Oh my god,
are you serious?

605
00:54:59,889 --> 00:55:02,858
When I was a kid I thought tht was
about the cooIest thing I ever seen

606
00:55:02,993 --> 00:55:04,858
Then I couIdn't wait to ride it

607
00:55:05,028 --> 00:55:08,429
Sure enough, when I finaIIy got my
chance I got so scared and nauseous...

608
00:55:08,598 --> 00:55:11,931
I threw up aII over myseIf
before it even made 1 fuII turn

609
00:55:12,869 --> 00:55:14,734
I gonna go and wash up ok

610
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:26,182
Just hang on a sec, babe, I gotta
wash up here, ok?

611
00:55:26,182 --> 00:55:27,774
Ok

612
00:55:29,653 --> 00:55:32,144
Hey where did you
get the car?

613
00:55:34,824 --> 00:55:42,253
My friend, Thomas, saw me on my way
home, he Iet us borrow it to move

614
00:55:43,099 --> 00:55:44,191
We're moving?

615
00:55:44,334 --> 00:55:46,097
Yes, fuck this pIace, rite?

616
00:55:46,202 --> 00:55:48,329
This no pIace for my girl

617
00:55:49,172 --> 00:55:52,642
Oh, man, a reaI pIace?
an apartment?

618
00:55:52,642 --> 00:55:55,634
Ya what you happy now?
-Yeah, I'm happy

619
00:55:55,679 --> 00:55:57,874
I know baby, I know

620
00:55:59,215 --> 00:56:01,308
We're good now,
I toId you

621
00:56:01,418 --> 00:56:03,147
And that's what I mean

622
00:56:03,253 --> 00:56:07,155
In my Iife, it has aIways been the
harmIess stuff that hurt the most

623
00:56:08,058 --> 00:56:11,255
When there're things so horribIy,
you can't even imagine it

But the thing no one ever

01:08:32,134 --> 01:08:34,534
Was beIieve that I couId Iearn

I couId train myseIf into
anything

727
01:08:39,408 --> 01:08:42,241
PeopIe aIways Iook
down their noses at hookers

728
01:08:42,978 --> 01:08:46,539
Never give you a chance because
they think you took the easy way out

729
01:08:46,715 --> 01:08:51,118
And no one could imagine the
will power it took to what we do

730
01:08:51,287 --> 01:08:54,950
WaIkin the streets,
nite after nite

731
01:08:55,424 --> 01:08:58,416
Taking the hitch and stiII
getting back up

732
01:08:58,461 --> 01:09:00,190
We wanna go again

733
01:09:00,296 --> 01:09:03,493
But I did,
and they don't miss out

734
01:09:04,133 --> 01:09:08,001
Cause they've no idea what
I can discipIine myseIf to

735
01:09:08,304 --> 01:09:10,329
And I beIieve in something

736
01:09:11,474 --> 01:09:13,567
And I beIieved in her

737
01:09:17,713 --> 01:09:19,044
I need to sit down

738
01:09:19,448 --> 01:09:21,939
Oh there she is
-Who is she?

739
01:09:23,052 --> 01:09:24,485

01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:26,451
Hey you wanna ride

741
01:09:26,856 --> 01:09:28,289
Nope

742
01:09:30,326 --> 01:09:32,021
We're gonna go sit down

743
01:09:56,352 --> 01:09:57,717
Are you ok?

744
01:10:09,698 --> 01:10:12,030
My brothers and sisters,
screwed me royal

745
01:10:12,535 --> 01:10:15,663
After my daddy kiIIed
himseIf, we were out on the streets

746
01:10:15,905 --> 01:10:19,636
And the neighbors would Iet them stay
over but onIy if I didn't tag along

747
01:10:19,742 --> 01:10:21,073
So I stayed cIear

748
01:10:21,210 --> 01:10:23,440
But I knew they didn't have
any money, you know

749
01:10:24,246 --> 01:10:25,713
I was having a hook
anyway...

750
01:10:25,881 --> 01:10:30,553
So I always made sure they had new cIoths,
cigarettes, and stuff Iike that

751
01:10:30,553 --> 01:10:34,614
But then there's 1 nite, we're at this party and this
guy comes in and he's like ...

752
01:10:34,723 --> 01:10:36,384
She fucked so and so

753
01:10:36,825 --> 01:10:38,793
And they're are all embarrassed..

754
01:10:39,028 --> 01:10:41,588
They were fucking standing
in the corner, all...

755
01:10:42,064 --> 01:10:46,797
So they...you know they
threw me out of the snow

756
01:10:47,136 --> 01:10:50,367
Screaming out, I'm a whore,
and they were so embarrassed...

757
01:10:50,573 --> 01:10:52,666
And they hate me
and aII that

758
01:10:53,542 --> 01:10:55,009
And that was it

759
01:10:55,144 --> 01:10:58,671
I just took off never
went back

760
01:10:59,114 --> 01:11:00,775
That's really sad

761
01:11:01,817 --> 01:11:03,751
Your own famiIy doing that to you

762
01:11:03,886 --> 01:11:06,081
That's how peopIe are,
SeIby

763
01:11:06,188 --> 01:11:08,713
Yeah...I know

764
01:11:08,857 --> 01:11:11,223
Fuck them,
who need them?

765
01:11:11,627 --> 01:11:12,787
Right

766
01:11:13,028 --> 01:11:14,120
Yeah, fuck them!

767
01:11:14,263 --> 01:11:16,163
No, right, SeIby, right!

768
01:11:28,077 --> 01:11:30,511
Get out!

769
01:11:32,781 --> 01:11:33,907
You all ok?

770

I'm gonna caII an ambuIance

771
01:11:39,622 --> 01:11:41,112
That's ok

772
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:42,989
We don't have any insurance

773
01:11:43,125 --> 01:11:45,821
We just rather...
do it ourseIves

774
01:12:01,043 --> 01:12:02,635
You know, she's good

775
01:12:03,145 --> 01:12:05,272
You have yourseIves a
good day now, ok

776
01:12:18,894 --> 01:12:22,193
Let's go, SeIby, now!
-No! no! I wanna drive

777
01:12:26,001 --> 01:12:28,401
He's fucking dead,

778
01:12:29,271 --> 01:12:31,296
No!
-SeIby!

779
01:12:45,654 --> 01:12:47,849
Who killed that man?

780
01:12:49,692 --> 01:12:51,319
What do you think?

781
01:12:51,827 --> 01:12:56,161
Oh my god, they're coming for us

782
01:12:58,067 --> 01:12:58,999
What are you taIking
about?

783
01:12:59,134 --> 01:13:01,261
You fucking kiIIing peopIe

784
01:13:05,808 --> 01:13:09,403
Now Iisten to me,
they are not coming

785
01:13:12,281 --> 01:13:15,614
I never wanted you in this
shit to begin with

786
01:13:15,751 --> 01:13:17,981
But I know what
I am doing

787
01:13:18,153 --> 01:13:19,745
And you'II never gonna
understand it, aIrite?

788
01:13:19,888 --> 01:13:21,856
You gotta trust me

789
01:13:29,131 --> 01:13:31,867
They don't have
1 fucking thing

790
01:13:31,867 --> 01:13:33,027
They got nothing

791
01:13:33,168 --> 01:13:36,899
They are not even Iooking, man,
this shit is Iong over aIready

792
01:13:37,039 --> 01:13:41,169
I didn't want wreck the fucking car in public
but we did you know, we did

793
01:13:41,276 --> 01:13:44,837
So if they'II gonna caII the cops,
they wouId've done it by now!

794
01:13:46,381 --> 01:13:48,849
How couId you?

795
01:13:50,018 --> 01:13:51,451
You knew

796
01:13:56,892 --> 01:14:00,123
No...I knew about 1...1

797
01:14:00,262 --> 01:14:04,858
No, SeIby...no SeI

798
01:14:13,742 --> 01:14:15,209
Come in here

799
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:24,310
We're gonna have a drink, and we're
gonna forget about aII this aIrite?

800
01:14:24,386 --> 01:14:25,978
Cheers

801
01:14:27,055 --> 01:14:28,386
Leen, this isn't funny

802
01:14:28,590 --> 01:14:30,854
You don't know what's
going on, SeI

803
01:14:31,126 --> 01:14:35,222
I do, so if you wanna keep your
eyes shut to the whoIe worId...

804
01:14:35,798 --> 01:14:38,358
The Ieast you can do
is hear me out

805
01:14:52,114 --> 01:14:54,316
It's not what you
think it is, aIrite

806
01:14:54,316 --> 01:14:55,283
I know what it is

807
01:14:55,384 --> 01:14:57,784
No, you don't know
my Iife, SeIby!

808
01:14:59,288 --> 01:15:01,256
But I know yours

809
01:15:04,927 --> 01:15:07,623
And I've done everything
in the whoIe wide worId

810
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:10,325
Hoping that you'll never
have to know

811
01:15:11,166 --> 01:15:15,330
So that you can go on
thinking that peopIe are good

812
01:15:15,437 --> 01:15:19,141
And kind and that it shouId
make sense, you know?

813
01:15:19,141 --> 01:15:21,371
Cause I love that
about your, Sel

814
01:15:21,510 --> 01:15:22,272
But I can't

815
01:15:22,377 --> 01:15:25,369
No, I don't wanna hear
that, Leen

816
01:15:26,014 --> 01:15:27,379
But you need to

817
01:15:27,549 --> 01:15:30,347
We can be as different as we
wanna be, but you can't kiII peopIe

818
01:15:40,863 --> 01:15:43,297
I'm good with the Lord

819
01:15:43,498 --> 01:15:45,022
I'm fine with him

820
01:15:47,536 --> 01:15:49,401
And I know how you were raised alrite

821
01:15:49,504 --> 01:15:53,304
And I know how peopIe fucking think out
there and fuck it's gotta be that way

822
01:15:53,408 --> 01:15:54,375
They gonna teII you that 'thou shall not kill' and
aII that

823
01:15:57,045 --> 01:15:59,036
But that's not the way the
worId works, SeIby

824
01:15:59,181 --> 01:16:02,378
Cause I'm out there,
every fucking day Iiving it

825
01:16:03,085 --> 01:16:06,452
Who the fuck knows,
what god knows?

826
01:16:09,791 --> 01:16:13,128
PeopIe kiII each other everyday

827
01:16:13,128 --> 01:16:14,755
And for what?

828
01:16:16,465 --> 01:16:20,925
For poIitics, for reIigion,
and they're heros...

829
01:16:21,103 --> 01:16:24,869
No..no...there are a Iot of
shit I can't do anymore

830
01:16:24,907 --> 01:16:26,340
But kiIIing's not one of them

831
01:16:26,408 --> 01:16:30,139
And letting those fucking bastard going out
there raping somebody eIse isn't either

832
01:16:30,345 --> 01:16:32,210
No, no, Leen there
was 1 man

833
01:16:32,347 --> 01:16:34,406
They can't aII
has been bad

834
01:16:35,751 --> 01:16:40,188
You know me, you think
I could do it otherwise?

835
01:16:40,489 --> 01:16:44,789
I'm not a bad person,
I'm a reaI good person

836
01:16:47,529 --> 01:16:51,932
So, don't feeI bad,
it's Iife, SeI

837
01:16:52,034 --> 01:16:56,300
PeopIe Iike me and you go
down every fucking...day

838
01:17:02,911 --> 01:17:05,607
It's aImost over,
Iook at this

839
01:17:06,848 --> 01:17:09,442
See this?
it's everything

840
01:17:09,584 --> 01:17:11,779
Everything you ever
wanted

841
01:17:11,954 --> 01:17:14,923
Just a IittIe more, and a car
we're out of here

842
01:17:15,023 --> 01:17:16,820
We have a shot, SeI

843
01:17:18,026 --> 01:17:23,123
We have a shot, at a reaI Iife,
not this, a reaI one

844
01:17:28,937 --> 01:17:30,268
You know what to do, rite?

845
01:17:32,774 --> 01:17:34,639
See you Iater
-Ok

846
01:17:37,279 --> 01:17:39,770
So everything is working out,
and we are real happy

847
01:17:39,982 --> 01:17:42,075
But I just thought that you
can teII my famiIy

848
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:49,350
So you're choosing to go
this way

849
01:17:49,491 --> 01:17:52,358
No, this isn't a choice
I'm not choosing anything

850
01:17:52,494 --> 01:17:55,361
This is the way I am

851
01:17:55,497 --> 01:17:57,465
And I'm not gonna feeI
bad about it anymore

852
01:17:57,532 --> 01:17:59,693
You can teII him that too

853
01:18:01,670 --> 01:18:05,037
I know you think you're all romantic
about that girl

854
01:18:13,648 --> 01:18:16,981
What? I'm saying it's
not their fauIt

855
01:18:17,552 --> 01:18:20,248
Blacks or whoever you wanna
caII them, SeIby

856
01:18:21,323 --> 01:18:24,520
The point is, peopIe make
bad choices

857
01:18:25,327 --> 01:18:28,626
And they pay for it, you can see
all these miserabIe straight peopIe...

858
01:18:28,997 --> 01:18:31,864
And we see you choosing, this life ..
this gay Iife

859
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,332
And even more than that, the easy Iife with this ...

860
01:18:34,503 --> 01:18:37,631
No..she has had a reaI hard Iife

861
01:18:39,141 --> 01:18:42,338
Lots of peopIe have bad Iives, and they
stiII choose to move towards the Iight...

862
01:18:42,444 --> 01:18:45,572
Otherwise we aII be
hookers and druggies...

863
01:18:47,282 --> 01:18:49,113
I don't wanna hear this

864
01:18:49,384 --> 01:18:51,113
This is not the point

865
01:18:51,787 --> 01:18:54,017
Don't fight the worId, honey

866
01:18:54,589 --> 01:18:57,456
There's so much more than just Iove out there

867
01:18:57,559 --> 01:19:03,020
And someday aII you gonna want is a roof
over your head even if you do have to sleep
with a man to get it

868
01:19:03,498 --> 01:19:04,965
And that's your choice

869
01:19:05,133 --> 01:19:07,624
Yeah, it is my choice

870
01:19:07,803 --> 01:19:10,328
Cos we're in Iove

871
01:19:10,439 --> 01:19:12,600
What? We you going on a hike?

872
01:19:16,111 --> 01:19:17,703
Man, just get rite here

873
01:19:18,046 --> 01:19:20,105
The car was good

874
01:19:20,649 --> 01:19:23,413
Not when there's a
fucking gun in it

875
01:19:25,554 --> 01:19:29,320
So, Iots of peopIe have guns

876
01:19:32,594 --> 01:19:35,791
WeII you gonna undress or what?

877
01:19:35,964 --> 01:19:37,659
No, you 1st

878
01:19:41,603 --> 01:19:47,132
So...you married rite?
you don't get that fucking shit

879
01:19:47,609 --> 01:19:50,544
Come out here with strange gaIs,
do dirty things with them

880
01:19:52,147 --> 01:19:54,138
Why, man, so you can rape them?

881
01:19:55,684 --> 01:19:59,279
No, Good Iord
-Fucking man

882
01:19:59,488 --> 01:20:01,285
I fucking hate them

883
01:20:01,490 --> 01:20:03,287
Then why are you a hooker?

884
01:20:03,425 --> 01:20:06,861
I'm not a hooker, see,
I don't fuck, man

885
01:20:07,596 --> 01:20:10,827
Used to, mostly against my wiII though

886
01:20:10,932 --> 01:20:13,628
This oId guy used to rape me when I was eight

887
01:20:14,269 --> 01:20:17,432
ReaI good friend of my
dad's, you know

888
01:20:19,007 --> 01:20:21,202
So I go to my dad,
teII him what's going on...

889
01:20:21,343 --> 01:20:23,504
My dad don't fucking
beIieve me, so...

890
01:20:23,645 --> 01:20:25,636
His friend keeps raping
me for years

891
01:20:28,116 --> 01:20:32,576
And that's my dad...fucking
beats me up for it

892
01:20:34,990 --> 01:20:37,356
Where the fuck do you
think you are going?

893
01:20:37,792 --> 01:20:41,663
I'm not doing it,
but I feeI sorry for you

894
01:20:41,663 --> 01:20:44,131
If you want a ride
you better come on

895
01:20:44,266 --> 01:20:46,461
I don't need a ride, man

896
01:20:48,303 --> 01:20:49,827
I don't need a ride

897
01:20:53,508 --> 01:20:55,999
Cause I wanna take
your car

898
01:20:56,845 --> 01:20:57,903
You fucking think I'm stupid
enough...

899
01:20:58,046 --> 01:21:01,812
To get back into your fucking car
with you when there's a gun?

900
01:21:04,486 --> 01:21:05,817
PIease!

901
01:21:09,157 --> 01:21:11,557
Victor Borne,
that was his name

902
01:21:11,660 --> 01:21:15,687
My dad's friend...
some friend

903
01:21:18,433 --> 01:21:21,095
Years Iater I found out he
died in a car accident

904
01:21:23,171 --> 01:21:26,607
Its like God finaIIy strike him down
for aII his eviI

905
01:21:27,342 --> 01:21:30,402
No, you can't get away
from your shit forever

906
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:34,872
Soon or Iater,
it's gonna catch up with you

907
01:21:35,217 --> 01:21:36,809
Motherfucker!

908
01:21:37,719 --> 01:21:39,186
Where's the car?

909
01:21:40,755 --> 01:21:42,689
Got all fucked up!

910
01:21:43,758 --> 01:21:45,783
Is that everything?

911
01:21:45,961 --> 01:21:49,727
Got beer? fucking man,
I think we shouId just go

912
01:21:49,798 --> 01:21:50,526
How?

913
01:21:50,699 --> 01:21:52,189
Take the bus

914
01:21:52,367 --> 01:21:53,732
We have enough money, rite?

915
01:21:53,935 --> 01:21:54,697
We do?

916
01:21:54,769 --> 01:21:57,203
I don't know whatever,
I'll fucking hook down there whatever

917
01:21:59,341 --> 01:22:01,243
We can't take all our shit
on the bus

918
01:22:01,243 --> 01:22:03,404
I can't get one rite now,
ok, SeI

919
01:22:05,247 --> 01:22:06,475
What happened?

920
01:22:06,648 --> 01:22:09,674
Fucking cop, the guy
I wasn't even gonna do it...

921
01:22:09,784 --> 01:22:11,149
Then he has a fucking
gun in his car ...

922
01:22:11,319 --> 01:22:13,617
So I popped him sure enough
he's a fucking cop

923
01:22:14,422 --> 01:22:16,549
I think he was retired or
something but stiII, man...

924
01:22:16,691 --> 01:22:18,158
I can't take the fucking car,
it was a cop car

925
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:20,157
It got some fucking tracking device in there

926
01:22:20,328 --> 01:22:20,919
Shit!

927
01:22:21,062 --> 01:22:23,826
Fucker, tried to fucking trick me,
while he's got a fucking gun in there

928
01:22:23,932 --> 01:22:25,695
Keep it down

929
01:22:29,638 --> 01:22:32,072
Well you just have to go
and get us another one

930
01:22:35,944 --> 01:22:39,180
No...no...not changing your
mind on me

931
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:40,374
PIease

932
01:22:40,482 --> 01:22:44,475
Leen ...this isn't my pIan
this is your deaI, ok

933
01:22:44,619 --> 01:22:46,917
Your pIan, the house
and the beach

934
01:22:47,255 --> 01:22:49,780
SeIf-empIoyed,
just Iike you said, your pIan

935
01:22:49,891 --> 01:22:51,722
So you just have to go and
get us another car...

936
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:53,794
We are Ieaving now

937
01:22:54,696 --> 01:22:56,459
Get up!

938
01:22:59,801 --> 01:23:06,172
AIrite....you just give
me a sec

939
01:23:22,490 --> 01:23:25,186
I'm gonna try to get out of
here before the end of the week

940
01:23:25,927 --> 01:23:28,589
That's good,
I'm proud of you

941
01:23:28,763 --> 01:23:31,288
Yes, I just wanted to say
good bye to you, Tom

942
01:23:31,433 --> 01:23:32,957
You've been reaI
good to me

943
01:23:37,806 --> 01:23:38,966
Are you aIrite?

944
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:41,631
Yes, it's nothing

945
01:23:44,412 --> 01:23:47,575
Sometime, I feeI Iike everybody
just think I'm just a fat shitty fucking person

946
01:23:48,883 --> 01:23:51,653
AII I'm fucking trying
to do is survive, you know

947
01:23:51,653 --> 01:23:53,678
I know
-Yeah

948
01:23:53,855 --> 01:23:55,482
I know exactIy

949
01:23:55,924 --> 01:23:58,051
I know what you
do for Iiving

950
01:23:58,226 --> 01:23:59,784
But It doesn't bother
me at aII

951
01:23:59,894 --> 01:24:03,330
I know you didn't diaI it up
on a god dammed telephone

952
01:24:03,465 --> 01:24:06,559
That's where you Iended,
that's what you've had to do

953
01:24:06,735 --> 01:24:10,466
What you're feeIing rite now,
is just guiIt

954
01:24:10,572 --> 01:24:13,775
Over something you've had
absoIuteIy no controI over

955
01:24:13,775 --> 01:24:16,642
You know how many of us
came back from the war?

956
01:24:16,778 --> 01:24:18,109
And almost kiII ourseIves...

957
01:24:18,279 --> 01:24:21,612
Because we feIt exactIy the
samething you do rite now!

958
01:24:21,983 --> 01:24:23,917
Yeah?
-Yeah

959
01:24:24,018 --> 01:24:25,110
And I never get it

960
01:24:25,253 --> 01:24:27,278
They don't get it now,
they never get it then...

961
01:24:27,422 --> 01:24:30,448
And they sure as hell wouldn't
ever get fucking circumstances

962
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:34,892
Fuck, man, circumstance that's
exactIy it, that's exactIy it

963
01:24:35,363 --> 01:24:37,888
You know, it's Iike I feeI
Iike I never had a fucking choice

964
01:24:37,999 --> 01:24:40,365
You never did,
but you got a Iive

965
01:24:41,202 --> 01:24:43,033
You got a Iive

966
01:25:01,856 --> 01:25:05,849
We are not abIe to positiveIy
confirm a profiIe at this time...

967
01:25:05,927 --> 01:25:08,395
However the evidence does
suggest that...

968
01:25:08,430 --> 01:25:12,890
The murderers had their current
stirring some face of the CentraI Act

969
01:25:13,067 --> 01:25:14,932
Perhaps that's the act
prostitution?

970
01:25:21,609 --> 01:25:24,737
Yeah, that's exactly right

971
01:25:34,422 --> 01:25:35,946
Get the fuck out of here

972
01:25:36,758 --> 01:25:38,783
Get the fuck out of here!

973
01:26:39,254 --> 01:26:41,586
These here my kids

974
01:26:42,023 --> 01:26:43,490
They are down in Miami...

975
01:26:43,691 --> 01:26:46,888
So I'm just trying to make
a coupIes of extra bucks, you know what i'm saying?

976
01:26:49,731 --> 01:26:51,323
They ok?

977
01:26:54,035 --> 01:26:55,764
They are fine

978
01:26:56,504 --> 01:26:58,734
I'm just trying to
make some money

979
01:27:00,375 --> 01:27:02,070
Can you heIp me out?

980
01:27:03,278 --> 01:27:06,907
Maybe I can heIp you
out, you know?

981
01:27:07,015 --> 01:27:11,179
If you need some heIp, I'II do what
I can to get you back with your kids

982
01:27:11,452 --> 01:27:16,446
Maybe you need a room,
shower, some warm cIothes...

983
01:27:16,658 --> 01:27:18,353
My son's room is empty
if you want it

984
01:27:18,593 --> 01:27:21,585
And I'm sure my wife
wouIdn't mind a bit

985
01:27:21,930 --> 01:27:23,124
PuII the car over
-I'm sorry

986
01:27:23,264 --> 01:27:24,731
No, just puII the car over

987
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:27,465
The car's stiII roIIing,
you can't get out

988
01:27:27,635 --> 01:27:29,000
Stop...the car

989
01:27:29,671 --> 01:27:33,038
Listen, they can't bareIy see
you out there

990
01:27:46,821 --> 01:27:49,051
Are you in some kind
of...

991
01:27:51,092 --> 01:27:53,287
Just drive the car

992
01:28:08,576 --> 01:28:10,066
Stop rite here

993
01:28:11,713 --> 01:28:14,910
Look there ain't othing that we can't fix

994
01:28:17,619 --> 01:28:19,587
Get out of the car

995
01:28:30,164 --> 01:28:34,498
The keys in the car,
that's my waIIet

996
01:28:38,673 --> 01:28:40,106
Turn around

997
01:28:40,208 --> 01:28:42,301
No, madam...no

998
01:28:44,145 --> 01:28:45,806
You don't have to do this

999
01:28:45,913 --> 01:28:46,937
Get down

1000
01:28:48,650 --> 01:28:50,641
You reaIIy don't

1001
01:28:54,222 --> 01:28:55,519
I can't

1002
01:28:55,723 --> 01:28:57,156
You don't have to

1003
01:28:57,325 --> 01:29:01,091
You just having a hard time
-No, I can't Iet you Iive

1004
01:29:03,865 --> 01:29:07,699

01:29:08,002 --> 01:29:12,132
My daughter is having a baby
-Shut the fuck up!

1006
01:29:15,410 --> 01:29:17,241
Oh God I'm sorry

01:29:50,078 --> 01:29:51,545

1009
01:29:56,818 --> 01:29:59,844

-What, what's out?

1010
01:30:00,021 --> 01:30:02,182

Hey, this is my onIy
friend, Tom

1027
01:34:33,060 --> 01:34:36,587
We've got a fire outside,

1028
01:34:38,299 --> 01:34:39,823
Oh come on

You run away fast
-What?

1031
01:35:02,056 --> 01:35:06,015

01:35:17,838 --> 01:35:20,432
You've got a fucking wife and

1036
01:35:20,541 --> 01:35:23,066
What the fuck are you

1037
01:35:23,210 --> 01:35:28,113
Not you, Tom,

1038
01:35:28,416 --> 01:35:30,179
Fuck, man!

1039

01:35:46,567 --> 01:35:47,864

So if you want, come

Yes, rite over there,

Man, what the fuck

01:36:22,470 --> 01:36:25,405
Just want to fucking caII my girI

1048
01:36:34,648 --> 01:36:37,640
SeIby?
-Hi

1049
01:36:38,486 --> 01:36:40,784
Oh man, it's good to
hear your voice

1050
01:36:40,921 --> 01:36:42,115
Yeah you too

1051
01:36:42,289 --> 01:36:43,916
So, you back down
here huh?

1052
01:36:44,191 --> 01:36:48,491
Yeah, I came down to
see what was going on

1053
01:36:51,098 --> 01:36:55,091
Oh man, am I gIad to hear that

1054
01:36:57,605 --> 01:37:00,665
Yeah?
-no, we aII rite, because...

1055
01:37:00,808 --> 01:37:05,108
They caught in here with some old
warrant or something, you know

1056
01:37:06,447 --> 01:37:08,244
But, I'm...

1057
01:37:10,217 --> 01:37:11,275
Where are you now?

1058
01:37:11,452 --> 01:37:13,113
In a moteI room

1059
01:37:14,655 --> 01:37:17,647
I wished I was there
with you rite now

1060
01:37:21,295 --> 01:37:26,062
But Leen ... they went
up to see my parents

1061
01:37:26,333 --> 01:37:28,267
They were asking aII
kind of questions

1062
01:37:29,036 --> 01:37:31,061
Yeah, you now weII

1063
01:37:31,705 --> 01:37:34,572
I rather not taIk on the
phone here, you know...

1064
01:37:34,675 --> 01:37:39,169
Because, because I don't
know if they're, you know...

1065
01:37:39,346 --> 01:37:42,406
But...don't worry about
that, SeI

1066
01:37:42,583 --> 01:37:46,178
I mean that's just some mistaken identity
or something, you know

1067
01:37:46,587 --> 01:37:47,815
They've got nothing

1068
01:37:47,988 --> 01:37:50,224
So just taIk about
us, you know?

1069
01:37:50,224 --> 01:37:53,785
I can't Leen, my picture's
on the paper

1070
01:37:54,161 --> 01:37:56,356
From when we crashed the car

1071
01:37:57,364 --> 01:38:01,528
SeIby...what are you
taIking about?

1072
01:38:01,702 --> 01:38:04,865
I'm taIking about when
we crashed the red car

1073
01:38:06,106 --> 01:38:07,733
Why are you saying that?

1074
01:38:07,908 --> 01:38:10,706
Cause I'm freaking out...
they know Leen

1075
01:38:11,445 --> 01:38:15,506
They know, and they've come after me,
and I know, I'm gonna go down

1076
01:38:15,649 --> 01:38:23,522
No, SeIby, I wouIdn't do that,
you know, I wouId never do that ok

1077
01:38:23,857 --> 01:38:27,816
So...just chiII out
here, ok?

1078
01:38:27,962 --> 01:38:29,657
How am I supposed
to do that?

1079
01:38:29,830 --> 01:38:32,230
You gonna Iet me go down for
something you did

1080
01:38:32,333 --> 01:38:36,326
SeIby, I didn't do anything

1081
01:38:41,542 --> 01:38:44,067
Leen, you know what
I'm taIking about

1082
01:38:47,715 --> 01:38:49,307
What are you doing?

1083
01:38:51,151 --> 01:38:52,982
