1
00:00:28,889 --> 00:00:31,016
They're trying to kill me!
They are crazy!

2
00:00:33,018 --> 00:00:34,937
Just calm down, Sally. You're safe now.

3
00:00:35,687 --> 00:00:36,887
Can you tell me what happened?

4
00:00:37,022 --> 00:00:38,649
We ran out of gas.

5
00:00:39,191 --> 00:00:40,651
Kirk went for help.

6
00:00:42,653 --> 00:00:43,654
Hello?

7
00:00:44,655 --> 00:00:45,739
Hello?

8
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,201
Anybody home?

9
00:01:02,714 --> 00:01:03,715
Kirk!

10
00:01:25,779 --> 00:01:26,780
Kirk?

11
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:46,174
Jerry!

12
00:01:46,258 --> 00:01:47,759
Jerry!

13
00:01:48,594 --> 00:01:50,846
Sally, I hear something. Stop! Stop!

14
00:02:08,113 --> 00:02:10,324
No! Please! Please!

15
00:02:11,617 --> 00:02:12,910
Please! Please stop!

16
00:02:17,915 --> 00:02:19,249
Give me that hammer!

17
00:02:53,992 --> 00:02:55,632
<i>Sheriff, we've got
the victim's statement.</i>

18
00:02:55,702 --> 00:02:57,496
<i>She's en route to the hospital.</i>

19
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:58,622
<i>What's your 20?</i>

20
00:02:58,705 --> 00:03:00,958
On Quick Hill Road.
Headed out there now.

21
00:03:01,249 --> 00:03:03,835
Call for an ambulance,
in case there's any others still alive.

22
00:03:04,544 --> 00:03:05,879
<i>Hey, Sheriff. This is Marvin.</i>

23
00:03:06,004 --> 00:03:08,215
<i>I'm only two minutes
behind you and I'm closing.</i>

24
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,901
<i>All right, step on it, Marvin.</i>

25
00:03:11,343 --> 00:03:13,095
<i>Sheriff, that family is likely armed.</i>

26
00:03:13,178 --> 00:03:14,930
<i>You gonna wait for backup?</i>

27
00:03:15,013 --> 00:03:17,599
<i>I can't wait. I'm going in now.</i>

28
00:03:24,982 --> 00:03:26,462
- I swear to God.
- Come on, let's go.

29
00:03:26,775 --> 00:03:27,776
Shit.

30
00:03:36,994 --> 00:03:40,122
<i>Sheriff wants
an ambulance to 647 Quick Hill Road.</i>

31
00:03:40,205 --> 00:03:41,248
<i>You copy?</i>

32
00:03:47,462 --> 00:03:49,339
- Drayton?

33
00:03:49,423 --> 00:03:51,466
You know why I'm here!

34
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,968
Come out and bring your son, Jed.

35
00:03:53,552 --> 00:03:55,053
Hands high above your heads.

36
00:03:58,265 --> 00:03:59,558
I ain't leavin', Drayton.

37
00:04:00,767 --> 00:04:03,270
I have a girl says you butchered her friends.

38
00:04:04,062 --> 00:04:06,148
No one's turning a blind eye to this.

39
00:04:11,445 --> 00:04:14,114
He's protecting the house and the family.

40
00:04:14,197 --> 00:04:15,837
Yeah, well that ain't the way I heard it.

41
00:04:28,295 --> 00:04:31,423
Oh, damn it. Come on out here!

42
00:04:31,757 --> 00:04:34,176
Look, I ain't waiting out here all day.

43
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:36,428
I'll call in the Staties,
if that's what you want.

44
00:04:37,763 --> 00:04:39,222
Send the boy out, Drayton!

45
00:04:40,265 --> 00:04:42,559
Look, this don't have to
get no uglier than it already is.

46
00:04:42,642 --> 00:04:43,643
Fuckers ain't getting anybody in this family.

47
00:04:43,727 --> 00:04:45,288
You don't wanna make it worse.

48
00:04:45,312 --> 00:04:47,647
I ain't leaving without the boy, Drayton.

49
00:04:47,773 --> 00:04:48,857
We're Sawyers!

50
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,358
- Hell, yeah!
- What's it gonna be?

51
00:04:50,442 --> 00:04:52,235
You do what you have to do, Sheriff!

52
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,403
Send the boy out!

53
00:04:57,616 --> 00:04:59,951
Give him the boy. He's simple anyway.

54
00:05:00,327 --> 00:05:01,870
He's family.

55
00:05:23,475 --> 00:05:24,935
We're gonna send out Jed.

56
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:28,146
All right. Send him.

57
00:05:29,272 --> 00:05:30,273
Hold it up, Marvin.

58
00:05:31,316 --> 00:05:32,818
And he gets a good lawyer!

59
00:05:33,693 --> 00:05:34,694
Agreed.

60
00:05:36,321 --> 00:05:37,405
You did it now, boy!

61
00:05:38,573 --> 00:05:39,894
You let that bitch meat get away.

62
00:05:45,163 --> 00:05:46,665
- Oh, shit.

63
00:05:52,546 --> 00:05:54,714
- Come on out, Sawyer!
- Give us that retard!

64
00:05:57,968 --> 00:05:59,845
There's more! Them ain't cops.

65
00:06:01,513 --> 00:06:02,848
Get back here, Drayton!

66
00:06:03,807 --> 00:06:04,808
We got trouble!

67
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,190
All right, just stay back now, Burt. I got this.

68
00:06:11,523 --> 00:06:13,066
- We're here to back you up.
- Yeah, you can start

69
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,527
by getting everybody back in their cars
and high-tailing it outta here.

70
00:06:15,694 --> 00:06:16,894
Yeah, that ain't gonna happen.

71
00:06:16,903 --> 00:06:19,489
Let's go, boys!
Lynch these son of a bitches.

72
00:06:19,698 --> 00:06:20,698
I've got control of this.

73
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,020
He's bringing the boy out, okay?

74
00:06:23,201 --> 00:06:24,202
What are we doing there, Sheriff?

75
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:25,412
Kick his ass out!

76
00:06:25,537 --> 00:06:27,017
Look, he's bringing his son out here.

77
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:28,540
Bring him out!

78
00:06:28,832 --> 00:06:31,084
- Light 'em up, Ollie!
- Special delivery!

79
00:06:31,751 --> 00:06:33,503
- No!
- Motherfuckers!

80
00:07:25,805 --> 00:07:27,933
Hell, yeah. Sawyer bonfire.

81
00:07:29,309 --> 00:07:30,393
This is on you, Burt.

82
00:07:32,354 --> 00:07:35,398
Eye for an eye, Sheriff.
Can't get around the Good Book.

83
00:07:39,611 --> 00:07:40,654
Helluva job, boys!

84
00:07:41,071 --> 00:07:42,364
Whoo!

85
00:07:56,461 --> 00:07:58,838
Keep looking.
When they're charred, they're hard to find.

86
00:08:00,215 --> 00:08:02,717
Ah, hell. Hey, Burt!

87
00:08:05,136 --> 00:08:06,471
- Yeah?
- Looky here.

88
00:08:07,973 --> 00:08:09,891
I'm hanging this bad boy over the bar.

89
00:08:11,643 --> 00:08:13,844
- This baby's coming home with me.
- We gonna be heroes.

90
00:08:30,537 --> 00:08:32,080
- Son of a bitch.

91
00:08:32,872 --> 00:08:34,040
Help us.

92
00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:38,169
Yeah. Yeah. Come here.

93
00:08:38,503 --> 00:08:40,922
Come on. Come here. Come on.

94
00:08:41,214 --> 00:08:42,841
Come on. Let her go. Let her go.

95
00:08:43,383 --> 00:08:46,177
Come on. Yeah. Yeah.

96
00:08:47,304 --> 00:08:49,180
I got her. Everything's okay.

97
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,227
Shh! Shh!

98
00:08:55,186 --> 00:08:56,187
It's okay.

99
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,450
Hey, Gavin, where've you been? What is...

100
00:09:09,034 --> 00:09:10,368
Oh, my God. It's a baby.

101
00:09:10,535 --> 00:09:12,454
Found her.
Brought her out through the woods.

102
00:09:14,289 --> 00:09:16,041
Gavin! Come on, man,
we're gonna be in the paper.

103
00:09:16,124 --> 00:09:17,584
Yeah, man, I'll be right there.

104
00:09:18,251 --> 00:09:19,252
Yeah, yeah.

105
00:09:19,502 --> 00:09:20,462
Come on now, you're gonna miss it!

106
00:09:20,545 --> 00:09:21,705
- Gavin...
- Come on!

107
00:09:21,713 --> 00:09:23,548
She's been burned.

108
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:25,592
Okay. Yeah, yeah, brother!

109
00:09:26,301 --> 00:09:27,302
Be right there, my man!

110
00:09:27,385 --> 00:09:28,595
We're gonna keep her, right?

111
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,760
I got her for you, Arlene.

112
00:09:29,804 --> 00:09:32,390
You never know how you look
till you get that picture took.

113
00:10:09,928 --> 00:10:10,929
I'll be right back.

114
00:10:15,975 --> 00:10:17,685
Come on, what were you thinking?

115
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:20,230
Hey. He was Ryan's idea. I warned you.

116
00:10:20,814 --> 00:10:22,524
Well, next time your raunchy-ass boyfriend

117
00:10:22,607 --> 00:10:25,443
tries to stick me with one of his
high school band buddies,

118
00:10:26,611 --> 00:10:28,947
- kiss him for me.
- What?

119
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,282
I like him. He was pretty cool.

120
00:10:31,616 --> 00:10:34,953
We started talking
and he made these incredible crepes.

121
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,454
Amazing.

122
00:10:36,663 --> 00:10:38,373
He's got this thing about becoming a chef.

123
00:10:38,456 --> 00:10:41,668
And there's actually a lot more to him
than meets the eye.

124
00:10:41,876 --> 00:10:44,754
So, do you think you can handle this
four-day road trip with him to New Orleans?

125
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:47,632
I am way ahead of you, girl.
He even volunteered to drive.

126
00:10:48,091 --> 00:10:50,093
- Seriously? Wow.
- Hell, yeah!

127
00:10:50,176 --> 00:10:52,095
- I was talking to...
- Hey, Nikki!

128
00:10:52,345 --> 00:10:53,865
Bobby wants you back at your register.

129
00:10:55,056 --> 00:10:57,642
All right. I'm gonna go work
on my Halloween costume.

130
00:10:58,143 --> 00:10:59,394
And I don't mean scary.

131
00:11:24,961 --> 00:11:27,422
Nikki digs your old high school friend.

132
00:11:27,505 --> 00:11:30,425
- Something about crepes?
- That's Kenny's signature move.

133
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:32,510
Nikki had no chance.

134
00:11:36,181 --> 00:11:38,342
I thought we weren't gonna
bring our work home with us.

135
00:11:39,434 --> 00:11:40,435
You think I'm cracked?

136
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:44,856
No. But you might
wanna broaden your extracurriculars.

137
00:11:47,442 --> 00:11:48,682
Get over here and tear this up.

138
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,695
I'm not up for a bruising.

139
00:11:51,404 --> 00:11:52,697
I wasn't talking about the bag.

140
00:11:53,948 --> 00:11:55,033
Neither was I.

141
00:12:09,214 --> 00:12:10,882
I love your crazy little birthmark.

142
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,763
Fuck.

143
00:12:18,056 --> 00:12:19,057
Who is that?

144
00:12:19,724 --> 00:12:22,810
Shit. That, it might be my contract.

145
00:12:27,732 --> 00:12:28,858
I'm coming!

146
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,252
- It's for you.
- Me?

147
00:12:48,086 --> 00:12:49,837
Some law office in Dallas, yeah.

148
00:12:55,343 --> 00:12:57,011
My grandmother died three weeks ago.

149
00:12:58,054 --> 00:12:59,734
I thought all your grandparents were dead.

150
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:00,848
So did I.

151
00:13:02,141 --> 00:13:04,227
I just wanted to have a child.

152
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,311
Enough.

153
00:13:05,395 --> 00:13:06,771
- I wanted to have a child so bad...
- Enough!

154
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:09,440
- ...and I couldn't!
- Enough, Arlene. Enough!

155
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,151
Why couldn't you tell me?

156
00:13:12,443 --> 00:13:13,653
Tell you what?

157
00:13:13,778 --> 00:13:15,238
Your mother has a defective uterus?

158
00:13:16,739 --> 00:13:18,741
She wanted a kid. End of story.

159
00:13:19,784 --> 00:13:21,995
So what? We're not
good enough for you now?

160
00:13:22,203 --> 00:13:23,204
I didn't say that.

161
00:13:23,955 --> 00:13:26,249
I just wanna know where I came from

162
00:13:26,332 --> 00:13:27,375
and who I came from.

163
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,627
Well, we're the ones that raised you.

164
00:13:29,794 --> 00:13:31,963
And you were damn lucky, I'd say.

165
00:13:32,463 --> 00:13:33,631
Those people were...

166
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:35,870
I can't even put that into words.

167
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:37,051
- There are no words...
- Shut up, Arlene.

168
00:13:37,135 --> 00:13:38,720
- ...for that, Heather.
- Shut up!

169
00:13:42,974 --> 00:13:44,434
You came from a shit heap.

170
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:48,521
There. Now you know.

171
00:13:49,355 --> 00:13:51,274
If I'd had half a mind, I'd've left you there.

172
00:13:56,362 --> 00:13:57,864
I'm out! I'm done.

173
00:13:57,947 --> 00:13:59,073
Don't even think about going down there!

174
00:13:59,532 --> 00:14:00,617
Heather!

175
00:14:02,785 --> 00:14:03,786
Heather.

176
00:14:05,371 --> 00:14:08,416
Heather. You go down there
you're gonna bring trouble on us.

177
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:09,792
What are you talking about?

178
00:14:11,336 --> 00:14:12,420
Trust me.

179
00:14:12,795 --> 00:14:16,132
Newt, Texas is the last place you wanna be.

180
00:14:37,028 --> 00:14:38,905
- How'd it go?
- Like shit.

181
00:14:39,781 --> 00:14:40,948
It sucks when you find out

182
00:14:41,032 --> 00:14:43,076
your parents have been
lying to you your whole life.

183
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,535
Baby, I'm sorry.

184
00:14:44,619 --> 00:14:45,828
I was adopted.

185
00:14:49,499 --> 00:14:51,376
I never felt right about them.

186
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:55,046
I'm gonna go pack.

187
00:14:55,296 --> 00:14:57,048
- For Texas, not New Orleans.
- Wait.

188
00:14:57,131 --> 00:14:58,883
- Hold on.
- No, Ryan. I have to go.

189
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:01,052
- Forget Halloween.
- Wait. Wait, just listen to me, please.

190
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,261
Hey.

191
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,975
Oh. Ryan called us.

192
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:10,728
- Kenny!
- That's really cool art.

193
00:15:11,187 --> 00:15:13,648
See, I kinda figured you'd wanna deal with

194
00:15:13,731 --> 00:15:15,024
your grandmother's stuff so...

195
00:15:15,108 --> 00:15:17,276
So, knowing how hard-headed you are,

196
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,820
we have decided to come with you.

197
00:15:19,362 --> 00:15:21,197
Really? You guys would do that?

198
00:15:21,447 --> 00:15:22,448
Are you kidding me?

199
00:15:23,157 --> 00:15:27,245
Come here. Of course!
Come on. You're our girl.

200
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:31,374
Listen, I wasn't gonna send you to some
cousin-fuck town all alone.

201
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:33,626
I don't mind driving to Texas.

202
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,086
I hear they got great barbecue.

203
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:38,715
So, maybe so, maybe no?

204
00:15:38,798 --> 00:15:41,050
All right. Sounds like a plan.

205
00:15:41,134 --> 00:15:42,593
- Let's do this.
- Oh, yeah.

206
00:15:53,896 --> 00:15:54,981
What! What!

207
00:15:55,273 --> 00:15:56,816
What! What!

208
00:16:02,947 --> 00:16:04,031
Texas here we come!

209
00:16:09,996 --> 00:16:11,706
Oh, my God. Are you kidding me?

210
00:16:11,789 --> 00:16:13,124
Jesus Christ.

211
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:14,417
Go, go!

212
00:16:20,423 --> 00:16:21,424
Fuck.

213
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:24,510
- What'd you get?
- All this.

214
00:16:25,762 --> 00:16:28,055
You like? 'Cause it was, like, 25 bucks.

215
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:29,932
Get out. That's a rip-off.

216
00:16:30,308 --> 00:16:32,852
Don't worry about it, honey.
It's on your credit card.

217
00:16:33,144 --> 00:16:35,813
Oh, yeah? Well, that's okay. You know why?

218
00:16:36,439 --> 00:16:37,440
Because...

219
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:41,027
- Kenny paid for the gas.
- What?

220
00:16:41,402 --> 00:16:42,862
What the... Give me that.

221
00:16:42,945 --> 00:16:44,739
- How'd you get that, man?
- Oh, Kenny.

222
00:16:44,864 --> 00:16:48,034
- Don't cry.
- It's okay. Let's go, baby.

223
00:16:48,117 --> 00:16:49,619
- Ready?
- Baby, let's go.

224
00:16:54,207 --> 00:16:55,208
What was that?

225
00:16:59,045 --> 00:17:00,338
Jesus, dude, you all right?

226
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:02,089
Oh, my God.

227
00:17:02,423 --> 00:17:04,183
- Yeah, it's all right.
- You hit him, Kenny.

228
00:17:05,843 --> 00:17:07,345
Sorry, I didn't see you, man.

229
00:17:07,428 --> 00:17:08,429
It's all right.

230
00:17:11,098 --> 00:17:12,308
I should probably sue.

231
00:17:14,268 --> 00:17:15,948
But I'll settle for a stick of that jerky.

232
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:20,191
Say, where y'all headed?

233
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:21,734
New Orleans.

234
00:17:22,235 --> 00:17:23,861
You're kiddin'! That's great!

235
00:17:24,362 --> 00:17:25,905
- That where you goin'?
- No, no.

236
00:17:26,197 --> 00:17:28,282
Shreveport? It's on the way.

237
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:30,243
Did your car break? Where's your car?

238
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,371
Uh, that's a bit of a long story.

239
00:17:33,788 --> 00:17:34,914
Short of it is

240
00:17:35,248 --> 00:17:38,251
my lady dumped my butt and I've been
thumbing my way back from Tulsa.

241
00:17:39,877 --> 00:17:40,878
I sure could use a ride.

242
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,530
Ain't got no problem paying my way.

243
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:45,842
60 bucks.

244
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,553
You'll be doing a guy a favor.
Help a fella out.

245
00:17:49,554 --> 00:17:50,555
Rain?

246
00:17:51,222 --> 00:17:53,057
- Okay. Come on.
- Yeah?

247
00:17:54,225 --> 00:17:56,060
We have to stop in Texas on the way.

248
00:17:56,227 --> 00:17:58,229
Well, sure beats walking.

249
00:17:59,105 --> 00:18:00,106
All right.

250
00:18:34,015 --> 00:18:35,016
You Okay?

251
00:18:36,601 --> 00:18:37,935
Yeah. I'm good.

252
00:18:39,604 --> 00:18:42,481
- You scared at all?
- No.

253
00:18:44,817 --> 00:18:47,028
I'm just wondering where I fit, you know?

254
00:18:47,445 --> 00:18:48,529
Yeah.

255
00:18:50,615 --> 00:18:51,699
So, what's in Newt?

256
00:18:53,951 --> 00:18:55,328
One-sided family reunion.

257
00:18:56,662 --> 00:18:59,123
My grandmother died.
I gotta sign some papers.

258
00:18:59,624 --> 00:19:03,002
My condolences. Were you two close?

259
00:19:03,461 --> 00:19:05,588
I just learned about her yesterday.

260
00:19:05,671 --> 00:19:07,089
But family's family.

261
00:19:07,757 --> 00:19:08,758
Amen, sister.

262
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:14,639
Family is a messy business.

263
00:19:14,722 --> 00:19:16,432
Ain't nothin' thicker than blood.

264
00:19:47,171 --> 00:19:49,048
So, do you know anything about this place?

265
00:19:50,007 --> 00:19:51,258
Just the address.

266
00:19:51,801 --> 00:19:53,241
We're just in and out, right?

267
00:19:53,678 --> 00:19:54,804
That's the deal.

268
00:19:56,389 --> 00:19:57,390
We'd never find this at night.

269
00:19:57,473 --> 00:19:59,754
What the hell?
We wouldn't be able to see anything.

270
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:01,268
Hey, this is it.

271
00:20:01,477 --> 00:20:03,312
This is Homestead Road. Make a left.

272
00:20:16,367 --> 00:20:17,567
This can't be it, right?

273
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:19,328
He said a big gate.

274
00:20:22,373 --> 00:20:23,374
Wow.

275
00:20:28,546 --> 00:20:30,089
- Wow.

276
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:33,342
Well, there's gotta be
something behind there.

277
00:20:33,718 --> 00:20:34,799
Like a castle or somethin'.

278
00:20:35,553 --> 00:20:36,721
All right.

279
00:21:04,915 --> 00:21:06,917
Mr. Farnsworth? I'm Heather.

280
00:21:07,001 --> 00:21:10,296
I could tell from the car. Dead ringer.

281
00:21:10,421 --> 00:21:12,181
Thank you for coming
all the way from Dallas.

282
00:21:12,298 --> 00:21:13,758
Anything for Verna.

283
00:21:13,841 --> 00:21:16,260
She was a good woman. Salt of the earth.

284
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:20,598
Though not the most popular in these parts.

285
00:21:21,682 --> 00:21:23,976
I didn't know you were bringing friends.

286
00:21:24,477 --> 00:21:25,478
Is that okay?

287
00:21:26,896 --> 00:21:29,482
Well, it's your house, if you want it.

288
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:31,984
Just so you know...

289
00:21:32,401 --> 00:21:34,820
Verna's trust forbids you from selling it.

290
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:36,679
It's all described in these papers.

291
00:21:36,947 --> 00:21:38,532
Okay. Thanks.

292
00:21:38,824 --> 00:21:41,786
You can't quite see the house from here.

293
00:21:42,453 --> 00:21:45,289
But it's just up beyond those trees.

294
00:21:48,626 --> 00:21:53,130
These keys, they open
everything inside and out.

295
00:21:53,631 --> 00:21:55,508
Verna was big on security.

296
00:21:57,802 --> 00:22:01,097
0-8-19.

297
00:22:02,473 --> 00:22:03,849
Best to remember it as a date.

298
00:22:04,141 --> 00:22:05,101
August 19th.

299
00:22:05,184 --> 00:22:07,061
Right. And the gates work automatically

300
00:22:07,144 --> 00:22:08,145
from the other side.

301
00:22:09,814 --> 00:22:11,982
- I have a house.
- And a whole list of assets

302
00:22:12,066 --> 00:22:13,266
that I'll be forwarding to you

303
00:22:13,317 --> 00:22:15,152
as soon as the accountants sign off.

304
00:22:16,821 --> 00:22:19,031
Oh. I almost forgot.

305
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:22,076
The most important thing.

306
00:22:22,993 --> 00:22:25,246
It's from Verna. Make sure you read it.

307
00:22:25,329 --> 00:22:26,747
Okay. I will.

308
00:22:26,831 --> 00:22:30,334
And call me if you have any questions.

309
00:22:33,129 --> 00:22:34,588
You're not coming in?

310
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:37,049
Uh...

311
00:22:37,174 --> 00:22:39,802
No. I promised some other folks I'd stop by.

312
00:22:40,094 --> 00:22:41,595
Don't forget to read Verna's letter.

313
00:22:43,097 --> 00:22:44,098
Hey.

314
00:22:44,849 --> 00:22:45,891
How did you find me?

315
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:49,520
Find you? Honey, you were never lost.

316
00:23:35,107 --> 00:23:36,650
It's a mansion! Oh, my God!

317
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:46,410
- Wow.
- Sweet.

318
00:23:46,911 --> 00:23:50,039
No way. Oh, my God, girl!

319
00:23:50,122 --> 00:23:51,540
- Wow.
- Are you kidding?

320
00:23:51,624 --> 00:23:53,250
This is nicer than the outside.

321
00:23:54,293 --> 00:23:56,253
- I don't know where to start.
- How about here?

322
00:24:00,841 --> 00:24:02,760
What is going on here?

323
00:24:02,885 --> 00:24:05,137
Wow.

324
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:06,847
Some fine dining.

325
00:24:09,099 --> 00:24:11,435
- Heather, can I open this one?
- Yeah.

326
00:24:14,021 --> 00:24:15,814
- Wow.
- Wow.

327
00:24:17,775 --> 00:24:19,568
This is definitely worth coming home to.

328
00:24:19,652 --> 00:24:20,653
Want some tea?

329
00:24:21,612 --> 00:24:22,655
It's all set up.

330
00:24:22,988 --> 00:24:24,073
So, Heather.

331
00:24:24,156 --> 00:24:27,159
What exactly did Granny do for a living?

332
00:24:28,118 --> 00:24:29,370
I have no idea.

333
00:24:29,453 --> 00:24:31,121
Hey! Check this out!

334
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:36,259
Look like Granny liked to play a little pool.

335
00:24:37,461 --> 00:24:38,963
- Who wanna play?
- I do.

336
00:24:39,171 --> 00:24:41,882
- Got money, bitch?
- Okay, I'm a bitch now.

337
00:24:42,132 --> 00:24:43,300
Yeah, you're my bitch.

338
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:44,718
Okay, rack 'em up.

339
00:24:44,802 --> 00:24:46,603
- What'd you say about my rack?
- Rack 'em up.

340
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:49,056
- Oh!
- Whoo.

341
00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:50,808
Now it's a party!

342
00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:53,477
- Nice.
- Oh, I scratched.

343
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,896
Oh, too bad.

344
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:57,815
Ouch!

345
00:24:58,357 --> 00:24:59,478
All right. You wanna see me?

346
00:24:59,483 --> 00:25:01,284
I'm gonna dominate you.
Where's the white one?

347
00:26:11,221 --> 00:26:12,222
Thank you.

348
00:26:32,409 --> 00:26:34,286
Hey! What's going on?

349
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:36,497
This house is insane!

350
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,457
God, we gotta stay the night. It's too cool.

351
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,250
That kitchen is so amazing.

352
00:26:40,334 --> 00:26:41,752
Y'all have to let me cook for you tonight.

353
00:26:42,002 --> 00:26:43,482
Yeah. And you can thank Darryl.

354
00:26:43,796 --> 00:26:45,964
He's the one
splurging on the steaks, ain't that right?

355
00:26:46,048 --> 00:26:47,508
Hey, Shreveport can wait.

356
00:26:47,591 --> 00:26:49,392
I needed something like this for a long time.

357
00:26:49,468 --> 00:26:50,469
Thanks, you guys.

358
00:26:50,969 --> 00:26:52,721
God, is he a Boy Scout or what?

359
00:26:54,014 --> 00:26:56,392
- Come on.
- No, I'm overkill on this mission.

360
00:26:56,934 --> 00:26:59,311
I'm gonna get the bags, clean up a little.

361
00:27:23,043 --> 00:27:24,878
Yeah, I'm a regular Boy Scout.

362
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:06,587
All right. So let's, uh, divide and conquer.

363
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,031
Will you take care of that for me?

364
00:28:15,012 --> 00:28:16,613
We'll see you in a few weeks, Mr. Mayor.

365
00:28:18,849 --> 00:28:22,811
Burt. Wish I had a swing
like that in my backyard.

366
00:28:22,895 --> 00:28:24,216
Yeah, that's something all right.

367
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,523
Hello, precious.

368
00:28:26,857 --> 00:28:27,941
Whoo.

369
00:28:36,158 --> 00:28:37,159
Come on, baby.

370
00:28:39,328 --> 00:28:41,955
Where's your mama? Where's your mama?

371
00:28:42,956 --> 00:28:43,957
Where's your mama?

372
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:47,377
I'm gonna get, like,
one more thing and then I'm done.

373
00:28:47,461 --> 00:28:49,379
- All right. I'll meet you outside.
- Cool.

374
00:28:49,463 --> 00:28:51,715
There's, like, a carnival
or something going on?

375
00:28:57,387 --> 00:28:59,389
Price check.
- Fuck are you doing?

376
00:29:00,265 --> 00:29:01,266
Nobody's looking.

377
00:29:02,684 --> 00:29:03,769
Listen, it was one time.

378
00:29:03,852 --> 00:29:07,356
One time. And I had,
like, 18 kamikazes. Come on.

379
00:29:08,941 --> 00:29:10,275
Come on. You begged for it.

380
00:29:11,109 --> 00:29:14,488
And now I'm begging you to
keep your hands off my shit.

381
00:29:17,407 --> 00:29:18,909
- Okay.
- All right.

382
00:30:14,631 --> 00:30:18,010
Beautiful big door for a beautiful big key.

383
00:30:24,474 --> 00:30:26,768
Oh, I got your stash now, you old cunt.

384
00:30:32,733 --> 00:30:34,334
What am I gonna do with a bunch of wine?

385
00:30:45,996 --> 00:30:46,997
What the hell is this?

386
00:30:57,799 --> 00:30:59,009
Here we go. Come on.

387
00:31:01,887 --> 00:31:02,929
Come on!

388
00:31:04,139 --> 00:31:05,807
I've dealt with stubborn bitches before.

389
00:31:06,808 --> 00:31:09,061
You just need some kicking.

390
00:31:09,978 --> 00:31:10,979
Now, honey.

391
00:31:22,115 --> 00:31:25,077
I'm coming back here. I don't quit easy!

392
00:31:56,441 --> 00:31:57,484
You're asking for trouble.

393
00:32:00,028 --> 00:32:02,189
That wouldn't burn
if you doused it with a fuel tanker.

394
00:32:04,574 --> 00:32:06,214
This here will give you some good flavor.

395
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:08,578
But if you wanna unleash some hellfire,

396
00:32:09,996 --> 00:32:11,164
this here's the stuff.

397
00:32:12,666 --> 00:32:13,667
Good to know.

398
00:32:17,421 --> 00:32:18,839
In town for the carnival?

399
00:32:20,424 --> 00:32:21,717
Just a little housewarming.

400
00:32:23,969 --> 00:32:26,012
Well, you best keep it down.

401
00:32:26,096 --> 00:32:27,376
I'd hate to have to haul you in.

402
00:32:27,806 --> 00:32:28,974
I'll try to behave.

403
00:32:30,058 --> 00:32:31,643
- How much is this?
- That'll be $9.

404
00:32:31,768 --> 00:32:33,048
So, whereabouts is this shindig?

405
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,231
Homestead Road.

406
00:32:37,315 --> 00:32:39,235
Ain't nothing out there
but the old Carson place.

407
00:32:39,276 --> 00:32:40,277
That's the one.

408
00:32:41,069 --> 00:32:42,309
I thought that place was empty.

409
00:32:42,612 --> 00:32:43,613
Not anymore.

410
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,240
This officer bothering you?

411
00:32:46,616 --> 00:32:48,368
Say the word and I'll shoot him.

412
00:32:48,452 --> 00:32:49,453
He will, too.

413
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,122
Go read some meters.

414
00:32:55,292 --> 00:32:58,378
Burt Hartman, proud mayor
of this little slice of paradise.

415
00:32:58,462 --> 00:32:59,463
How're you doin'?

416
00:33:01,423 --> 00:33:03,383
- Heather.
- Nice to meet you, Heather.

417
00:33:04,968 --> 00:33:06,303
Now, my ears aren't what they used to be,

418
00:33:06,386 --> 00:33:07,747
but I swear I coulda heard you say

419
00:33:07,804 --> 00:33:09,125
something about the Carson place.

420
00:33:09,806 --> 00:33:10,807
I inherited it.

421
00:33:11,808 --> 00:33:14,060
- You're a Carson?
- No.

422
00:33:15,645 --> 00:33:17,522
- You're not a Sawyer.
- Yep.

423
00:33:19,316 --> 00:33:20,525
Yeah, you've got her eyes.

424
00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:22,235
- You knew her?
- Yeah.

425
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:23,820
Me and your family go way back.

426
00:33:24,112 --> 00:33:25,197
And I know they wouldn't want you

427
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,365
to be burdened with that beat-up old trap.

428
00:33:27,449 --> 00:33:28,450
Tell you what.

429
00:33:28,867 --> 00:33:30,660
I'll take the whole place off your hands.

430
00:33:30,952 --> 00:33:31,953
No, thanks.

431
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,956
Gonna hardball me, huh?
Hell, I like you already.

432
00:33:35,165 --> 00:33:36,166
Come on, let's go.

433
00:33:36,792 --> 00:33:38,293
Come on. Give me a number.

434
00:33:45,133 --> 00:33:46,343
Yo!

435
00:33:46,802 --> 00:33:47,844
Oh.

436
00:33:48,094 --> 00:33:50,055
- Oh, shit.
- What?

437
00:33:50,514 --> 00:33:51,515
Fucking thief.

438
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:55,602
He took my keys.

439
00:33:56,561 --> 00:33:59,356
- Wow, he played that smooth.
- Yeah, he did.

440
00:33:59,606 --> 00:34:00,857
We should've never picked that guy up.

441
00:34:00,941 --> 00:34:01,942
Yo!

442
00:34:03,693 --> 00:34:05,195
- Whoo!
- Let's do this right.

443
00:34:06,822 --> 00:34:08,698
- What's wrong?
- Darryl ripped us off.

444
00:34:09,783 --> 00:34:12,619
So he heisted some ashtrays
and candlesticks.

445
00:34:12,702 --> 00:34:15,831
That shouldn't keep you
from having a good time. Come on.

446
00:34:16,081 --> 00:34:17,624
- Cheers, you guys.
- Yeah.

447
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:19,084
To happiness.

448
00:34:19,459 --> 00:34:22,462
- To the queen.
- Yeah.

449
00:34:22,546 --> 00:34:25,048
- To the Sawyers.
- To the Sawyers.

450
00:34:25,131 --> 00:34:26,383
Sawyers. All right.

451
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,807
Hey, there's a butler's pantry in here!

452
00:36:48,233 --> 00:36:49,234
Darryl?

453
00:36:55,532 --> 00:36:56,533
Darryl?

454
00:37:01,621 --> 00:37:03,331
Yo, Darryl!

455
00:37:18,722 --> 00:37:19,723
Darryl!

456
00:38:05,769 --> 00:38:06,895
Oh, my God, you've gotta see this!

457
00:38:06,978 --> 00:38:07,979
What?

458
00:38:08,104 --> 00:38:10,106
- It's so fucked up! Come on!
- Whoa, what's wrong?

459
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,441
Come on!

460
00:38:14,652 --> 00:38:16,321
- It's right down there.
- Where?

461
00:38:16,446 --> 00:38:18,656
- It's right down there.
- Where?

462
00:38:18,782 --> 00:38:20,617
It's in that stall, right there.

463
00:38:21,242 --> 00:38:22,911
- In here?
- Oh, God!

464
00:38:24,954 --> 00:38:26,039
Nikki, I don't see shit.

465
00:38:26,122 --> 00:38:29,542
It's right under that bucket.
It's under that bucket right there.

466
00:38:29,626 --> 00:38:30,794
It's right under that bucket.

467
00:38:32,462 --> 00:38:33,463
Okay.

468
00:38:42,138 --> 00:38:43,306
What the hell, Nikki?

469
00:38:45,308 --> 00:38:46,810
What are you doing?

470
00:38:53,149 --> 00:38:54,317
I told you it was fucked up.

471
00:39:53,084 --> 00:39:54,085
Ryan!

472
00:39:56,379 --> 00:39:57,380
Ryan!

473
00:40:00,133 --> 00:40:01,134
You guys!

474
00:40:08,349 --> 00:40:09,350
Kenny?

475
00:44:33,906 --> 00:44:34,907
Dude, what the...

476
00:44:36,117 --> 00:44:38,286
What is that? What the... What is he doing?

477
00:44:40,163 --> 00:44:41,164
Who is that?

478
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:44,709
Hey! Hey!

479
00:44:49,338 --> 00:44:50,339
Hey!

480
00:44:52,884 --> 00:44:53,885
- Go.
- What?

481
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:55,011
- Oh, my God!
- Go!

482
00:45:01,142 --> 00:45:02,685
- Move. Move!
- Close the door!

483
00:45:31,881 --> 00:45:33,633
Welcome to Texas, motherfucker!

484
00:45:40,723 --> 00:45:41,724
Did you hit him?

485
00:45:42,391 --> 00:45:43,392
I don't know.

486
00:45:43,726 --> 00:45:45,061
- Did you hit him?
- I don't know!

487
00:45:49,065 --> 00:45:50,186
Something's coming. Back up.

488
00:45:50,566 --> 00:45:51,817
Back up! Back up, Nikki!

489
00:45:54,987 --> 00:45:56,280
- Get in the van!
- It's Heather!

490
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,324
Move over, move over!

491
00:45:58,407 --> 00:46:00,576
Let me in! Hurry and get us out of here! Go!

492
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,245
Go, go, go, go!

493
00:46:07,917 --> 00:46:09,168
Go!

494
00:46:11,837 --> 00:46:12,838
Go! Go!

495
00:46:15,049 --> 00:46:16,175
Go, go, go!

496
00:46:17,677 --> 00:46:18,761
What the hell was that?

497
00:46:21,889 --> 00:46:22,890
Where's Kenny?

498
00:46:24,016 --> 00:46:25,476
He's dead. They're fucking dead!

499
00:46:31,774 --> 00:46:33,025
Ryan, slow down. Slow down.

500
00:46:33,109 --> 00:46:34,652
The gate, the gate needs to open!

501
00:46:34,819 --> 00:46:36,339
- Give it time to open!
- We got to go.

502
00:46:36,445 --> 00:46:37,572
Fuck the gate! Buckle up!

503
00:46:46,581 --> 00:46:48,374
- What happened?
- The car stopped.

504
00:46:48,457 --> 00:46:49,458
Why?

505
00:46:49,709 --> 00:46:51,294
Okay, back it up. Back...

506
00:46:54,755 --> 00:46:56,674
- Ryan!
- Back it up, back it up, back it up!

507
00:46:56,757 --> 00:46:58,397
- Back up the car!
- What's wrong with it?

508
00:46:58,801 --> 00:47:00,177
- Ryan, go!
- I'm fucking trying!

509
00:47:00,386 --> 00:47:02,096
- Back up the car!
- It won't start!

510
00:47:04,473 --> 00:47:05,933
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

511
00:47:06,225 --> 00:47:08,144
- Back up!
- Here we go. Here we go.

512
00:47:13,149 --> 00:47:14,609
Wait for the gate to open.

513
00:47:16,527 --> 00:47:17,903
- Fuck!
- Ryan!

514
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:19,071
Ryan! Start it!

515
00:47:20,906 --> 00:47:22,450
- Go Ryan, go!
- It won't start!

516
00:47:23,909 --> 00:47:25,369
Now, go, go, go!

517
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:27,413
- Ryan, go!
- Ryan, go!

518
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:29,332
- Ryan, go!
- Come on!

519
00:47:29,415 --> 00:47:30,791
- Go, go!
- Please, go!

520
00:47:32,084 --> 00:47:33,085
Come on!

521
00:47:41,636 --> 00:47:42,637
Here he comes!

522
00:48:06,118 --> 00:48:09,705
Ryan. Ryan.

523
00:48:36,232 --> 00:48:37,858
Heather, what happened?

524
00:48:42,822 --> 00:48:43,989
What?

525
00:48:44,115 --> 00:48:48,077
Quiet. Quiet.

526
00:48:52,039 --> 00:48:53,582
We gotta get outta here now.

527
00:48:53,666 --> 00:48:55,334
We gotta get outta here right now!

528
00:49:04,135 --> 00:49:06,762
Get away, get away, he's coming over here!

529
00:49:11,392 --> 00:49:12,393
My leg.

530
00:49:14,729 --> 00:49:15,730
No, Nikki!

531
00:49:48,971 --> 00:49:51,557
Hey! Hey, you country fuck!

532
00:50:30,721 --> 00:50:31,722
Run, run!

533
00:50:38,854 --> 00:50:40,356
Hey, Wanna play a game?

534
00:50:42,691 --> 00:50:43,692
Call the police!

535
00:50:49,198 --> 00:50:51,367
Get out of the way! Call the police!

536
00:50:54,245 --> 00:50:56,038
- Go! Get out of the way!
- What the hell?

537
00:51:02,211 --> 00:51:03,337
What is going on?

538
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:05,422
Hey! Hey!

539
00:51:40,082 --> 00:51:41,083
Drop the fucking saw!

540
00:51:42,626 --> 00:51:43,669
I said, drop it!

541
00:51:43,752 --> 00:51:44,753
Put it down!

542
00:52:06,775 --> 00:52:07,815
Where's the girl?

543
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:09,403
Carl is tending to her in the back.

544
00:52:09,486 --> 00:52:10,613
All right.

545
00:52:18,454 --> 00:52:21,248
<i>Sheriff? This is Marvin. I'm at the crash site.</i>

546
00:52:21,332 --> 00:52:23,208
<i>- You copy?
- Go ahead, Marvin.</i>

547
00:52:23,918 --> 00:52:25,358
Approaching the vehicle now.

548
00:52:25,794 --> 00:52:28,213
Late model VW bus on its side.

549
00:52:30,382 --> 00:52:31,383
It's a real mess.

550
00:52:32,676 --> 00:52:34,356
<i>- Do you need an ambulance?
- Checking now.</i>

551
00:52:37,723 --> 00:52:39,892
That's a negative.
No one. No victims on the scene.

552
00:52:41,644 --> 00:52:44,980
Sheriff? There's blood everywhere.

553
00:52:45,564 --> 00:52:49,234
Seat's all sawed up.
Somebody died out here.

554
00:52:49,944 --> 00:52:52,264
All right, stay where you are, Marvin.
I'll get back at ya.

555
00:52:52,655 --> 00:52:53,656
Roger that.

556
00:53:10,381 --> 00:53:12,967
- Hey.
- They find her?

557
00:53:14,426 --> 00:53:15,427
We Will.

558
00:53:17,805 --> 00:53:20,516
- Got you a shirt here.
- Thanks.

559
00:53:20,683 --> 00:53:21,684
At least it's clean.

560
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:26,710
I should've never brought them here.

561
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:33,112
Look, this town ain't much,
but we take care of our own here.

562
00:53:33,946 --> 00:53:35,698
He'll be a sack of meat scraps by dawn.

563
00:53:36,824 --> 00:53:38,033
You can count on it.

564
00:53:39,368 --> 00:53:40,369
Carl!

565
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,959
- Take your time.
- Okay.

566
00:53:57,928 --> 00:53:59,555
Sheriff Hooper? This is Heather.

567
00:53:59,638 --> 00:54:00,639
Hi.

568
00:54:00,806 --> 00:54:01,807
You the girl that guy was chasing?

569
00:54:01,974 --> 00:54:02,975
Yeah.

570
00:54:03,142 --> 00:54:05,394
He killed my friends, but Nikki...

571
00:54:06,103 --> 00:54:07,604
She was still alive after the crash.

572
00:54:07,896 --> 00:54:09,565
Yeah, we're on it,
but there was no one at the site.

573
00:54:09,732 --> 00:54:12,132
No, she was there. I left her there.
He must have moved them.

574
00:54:12,151 --> 00:54:13,277
Do you know who he is?

575
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:16,280
No. He was in the house, he was...

576
00:54:16,488 --> 00:54:18,365
- What house?
- The Carson Estate.

577
00:54:20,659 --> 00:54:23,037
My grandmother left it to me. Verna Carson.

578
00:54:23,579 --> 00:54:24,955
We just got here a few hours ago.

579
00:54:26,623 --> 00:54:28,417
I'm a Sawyer, if that's your next question.

580
00:54:28,751 --> 00:54:30,753
Sheriff, I dug through the evidence room.

581
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:32,981
Pulled out what we had on Verna Carson.

582
00:54:33,922 --> 00:54:35,466
Also pulled a big file on the Sawyers.

583
00:54:35,591 --> 00:54:36,967
You get a good look at him?

584
00:54:37,259 --> 00:54:38,427
He was wearing a face.

585
00:54:39,303 --> 00:54:40,304
A mask?

586
00:54:42,973 --> 00:54:44,058
A human face.

587
00:54:47,644 --> 00:54:49,021
Carl, we're a little short-handed.

588
00:54:49,271 --> 00:54:51,690
I'm gonna need you out on the street.
Get going.

589
00:54:53,776 --> 00:54:55,377
<i>Sheriff, the mayor just got here.</i>

590
00:54:55,486 --> 00:54:56,737
<i>He's looking for you.</i>

591
00:54:58,072 --> 00:54:59,073
Thanks.

592
00:54:59,948 --> 00:55:02,117
Take a seat. I'll be back in a minute.

593
00:55:06,455 --> 00:55:08,256
Some fucking crazy just tore up the carnival!

594
00:55:08,415 --> 00:55:10,125
I need to know
what the police are gonna do about it!

595
00:55:10,417 --> 00:55:11,418
My office.

596
00:55:15,798 --> 00:55:16,840
I think it may be Jed.

597
00:55:17,341 --> 00:55:18,342
Jed Sawyer?

598
00:55:18,592 --> 00:55:19,927
No way.

599
00:55:20,219 --> 00:55:21,929
We burned that place
to the ground years ago, Hooper.

600
00:55:22,012 --> 00:55:23,347
You were there. No one escaped.

601
00:55:23,514 --> 00:55:25,474
Well, maybe he crawled out
through the back. I don't know.

602
00:55:25,766 --> 00:55:27,226
You telling me he's been
holed up all these years

603
00:55:27,309 --> 00:55:28,477
and now he's running around on the loose?

604
00:55:28,644 --> 00:55:31,188
I'm telling you a 6'5" man

605
00:55:31,313 --> 00:55:32,815
came out of Verna Carson's house

606
00:55:32,981 --> 00:55:35,484
wearing a skin mask and wielding that.

607
00:55:35,984 --> 00:55:37,065
Sheriff?

608
00:55:37,486 --> 00:55:38,904
I'm at the Carson place.

609
00:55:39,655 --> 00:55:40,823
<i>Gate's busted open.</i>

610
00:55:41,782 --> 00:55:42,991
There's a broken side mirror that looks like

611
00:55:43,075 --> 00:55:44,118
it matches the van.

612
00:55:44,201 --> 00:55:46,245
Marvin, I told you to stay at the van.

613
00:55:46,328 --> 00:55:47,329
Now, that's an order. Do you copy?

614
00:55:47,412 --> 00:55:48,956
Hell, no! That's not how we play this!

615
00:55:49,164 --> 00:55:50,916
There's a blood trail on the pavement.

616
00:55:51,291 --> 00:55:53,293
Sheriff, no disrespect,
but I think I need to move on this.

617
00:55:53,377 --> 00:55:54,938
<i>That's not your call, Officer.</i>

618
00:55:55,295 --> 00:55:57,673
<i>Marvin! This is Mayor Hartman.
You got your Eagle?</i>

619
00:55:57,923 --> 00:55:59,323
You know it, with an extended clip.

620
00:56:00,843 --> 00:56:02,302
Just looking for a reason, sir.

621
00:56:02,511 --> 00:56:04,072
Then what the hell are you waiting for?

622
00:56:04,972 --> 00:56:06,849
Marvin, stand down.

623
00:56:06,932 --> 00:56:08,642
Now, we believe Jed Sawyer may be alive.

624
00:56:08,809 --> 00:56:09,930
<i>And he may be in that house.</i>

625
00:56:10,018 --> 00:56:13,814
Copy that, sir,
but a chainsaw don't make you bulletproof.

626
00:57:40,984 --> 00:57:42,027
Door's wide open.

627
00:57:42,736 --> 00:57:44,112
This is a mistake.

628
00:57:44,196 --> 00:57:45,836
Now, stop it now before you get him hurt.

629
00:57:45,864 --> 00:57:47,544
<i>- It's hot pursuit, Hooper.
- I'm going in.</i>

630
00:57:52,871 --> 00:57:53,872
Police!

631
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:05,801
Yeah.

632
00:58:05,968 --> 00:58:08,428
- Give me a visual.
- You got it.

633
00:58:12,474 --> 00:58:13,475
Movin'.

634
00:59:03,984 --> 00:59:05,027
This is on you, Burt.

635
00:59:05,193 --> 00:59:06,528
Eye for an eye, Sheriff.

636
00:59:06,611 --> 00:59:07,863
Can't get around the Good Book.

637
00:59:16,371 --> 00:59:17,531
<i>Entering the kitchen.</i>

638
00:59:17,873 --> 00:59:18,874
Proceed.

639
00:59:26,465 --> 00:59:27,591
What the hell?

640
00:59:32,262 --> 00:59:33,638
<i>Following the blood.</i>

641
00:59:37,726 --> 00:59:38,727
Jesus!

642
00:59:40,937 --> 00:59:41,938
<i>You seeing this?</i>

643
00:59:42,898 --> 00:59:43,899
Shit.

644
00:59:48,403 --> 00:59:50,322
Looks like it leads to this door.

645
00:59:51,573 --> 00:59:52,574
<i>Push it open.</i>

646
01:00:01,083 --> 01:00:02,167
What the hell is this?

647
01:00:02,751 --> 01:00:03,919
<i>Proceed, Officer.</i>

648
01:00:09,132 --> 01:00:10,384
I don't know about this, Burt.

649
01:00:10,592 --> 01:00:12,912
God damn it. Do I gotta come down there
and hold your hand?

650
01:00:41,289 --> 01:00:42,529
<i>So, where are you now?</i>

651
01:00:42,541 --> 01:00:43,708
<i>I'm in the wine cellar.</i>

652
01:00:50,424 --> 01:00:52,426
There's an opening to some kind of...

653
01:00:54,803 --> 01:00:55,804
I don't know.

654
01:00:58,640 --> 01:00:59,641
Going through.

655
01:01:05,147 --> 01:01:08,650
Looks like some kind of crazy catacomb.

656
01:01:13,155 --> 01:01:14,656
Still following the blood.

657
01:01:27,836 --> 01:01:30,046
Getting a bad feeling here.

658
01:01:49,065 --> 01:01:50,734
Jesus Christ. What is this?

659
01:01:57,991 --> 01:01:58,992
It's a haven?

660
01:02:12,172 --> 01:02:13,173
Dresses.

661
01:02:18,428 --> 01:02:19,429
High heels.

662
01:02:21,389 --> 01:02:22,724
<i>Little farm toys.</i>

663
01:02:23,433 --> 01:02:24,559
<i>Bones.</i>

664
01:02:25,101 --> 01:02:26,102
<i>Man.</i>

665
01:02:31,233 --> 01:02:35,403
Ladies makeup? What a fruitcake.

666
01:03:18,738 --> 01:03:20,198
<i>This is the most disturbing place</i>

667
01:03:20,282 --> 01:03:21,324
<i>that I have ever been.</i>

668
01:03:21,575 --> 01:03:22,617
What's that to your left?

669
01:03:23,285 --> 01:03:24,286
It's a door.

670
01:03:24,369 --> 01:03:26,129
<i>Marvin, keep your hands
on that gun!</i>

671
01:03:31,376 --> 01:03:33,003
My fucking God.

672
01:03:34,588 --> 01:03:35,589
<i>How many?</i>

673
01:03:37,757 --> 01:03:39,217
<i>You tell me.</i>

674
01:03:39,467 --> 01:03:40,802
What fucking human does that?

675
01:03:45,098 --> 01:03:46,975
Shit, this is fucked up.

676
01:03:52,188 --> 01:03:53,315
What's in there?

677
01:03:53,607 --> 01:03:54,733
<i>What's in the freezer?</i>

678
01:03:59,821 --> 01:04:00,942
<i>Be careful, Marvin.</i>

679
01:04:20,133 --> 01:04:21,134
Oh!

680
01:04:22,552 --> 01:04:23,553
Shit!

681
01:04:23,803 --> 01:04:24,846
It's okay! It's okay. Didn't happen!

682
01:04:25,013 --> 01:04:27,098
Marvin! You get the hell
out of there right now!

683
01:04:31,645 --> 01:04:32,896
That sick fuck'll be back out there tonight.

684
01:04:33,313 --> 01:04:34,314
We rally the boys,

685
01:04:34,481 --> 01:04:36,024
we torch that place to the ground!

686
01:04:36,107 --> 01:04:38,526
End this! Finish what we started years ago.

687
01:04:39,027 --> 01:04:40,528
Not this time. Not on my watch!

688
01:05:30,578 --> 01:05:33,331
- What happened that day was a travesty.
- It was justice!

689
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:36,626
I wanna see the Sawyer girl.

690
01:05:37,210 --> 01:05:39,587
She's a victim, Burt!
She hasn't done anything!

691
01:05:40,213 --> 01:05:41,715
She's breathing, ain't she?

692
01:05:53,685 --> 01:05:54,728
Yeah, I know what you're thinking, Burt.

693
01:05:55,019 --> 01:05:56,229
You have no idea!

694
01:05:58,648 --> 01:06:00,358
Nothing better happen to that girl, Burt!

695
01:06:17,208 --> 01:06:19,369
- Hello, Farnsworth here.
- Hi. This is Heather Miller.

696
01:06:20,295 --> 01:06:22,005
My friends have all been killed.

697
01:06:22,088 --> 01:06:23,840
I just found out about August 19th.

698
01:06:23,923 --> 01:06:25,175
How could you leave us
alone in that house?

699
01:06:25,467 --> 01:06:27,635
Okay. Where are you?

700
01:06:28,428 --> 01:06:29,804
I'm at the bank on Main Street.

701
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:32,223
Uh, meet me at Johnny B. Red's.

702
01:06:32,307 --> 01:06:33,808
It's a bar about a quarter mile

703
01:06:34,017 --> 01:06:35,977
<i>east on Fifth and Main.</i>

704
01:06:36,144 --> 01:06:37,270
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

705
01:06:39,481 --> 01:06:42,066
I want your Halloween candy!

706
01:06:42,233 --> 01:06:43,651
Come on and party with us!

707
01:08:49,819 --> 01:08:50,987
Why didn't you warn me?

708
01:08:51,070 --> 01:08:52,155
All my friends are dead.

709
01:08:52,238 --> 01:08:54,324
My family was wiped out by this crazy town.

710
01:08:54,741 --> 01:08:56,993
- Did you read Verna's letter?
- No.

711
01:08:57,452 --> 01:08:58,995
Well, I asked you to, right?

712
01:09:00,747 --> 01:09:03,333
Verna was very particular.
I'm sure she laid it all out.

713
01:09:03,625 --> 01:09:04,709
But you knew about him.

714
01:09:04,792 --> 01:09:06,593
You knew about this town.
You knew everything.

715
01:09:06,794 --> 01:09:07,795
Oh, okay.

716
01:09:08,463 --> 01:09:09,464
Okay, so who is he?

717
01:09:10,381 --> 01:09:13,927
Well, the person in the basement

718
01:09:15,345 --> 01:09:16,846
is Jedidiah Sawyer.

719
01:09:17,639 --> 01:09:18,640
Goes by Jed.

720
01:09:19,641 --> 01:09:20,642
He's your cousin.

721
01:09:22,310 --> 01:09:23,811
For years I suspected something,

722
01:09:23,895 --> 01:09:25,730
but I never knew for sure about Jed

723
01:09:25,813 --> 01:09:28,524
until about four months ago when Verna,

724
01:09:29,984 --> 01:09:32,695
who was very sick, presented him to me.

725
01:09:33,446 --> 01:09:36,950
A grown man, huge, but mentally stunted.

726
01:09:38,159 --> 01:09:40,662
With emotions of an eight-year-old.

727
01:09:41,996 --> 01:09:43,831
Frankly, he scared the shit out of me.

728
01:09:44,666 --> 01:09:45,667
Why'd she keep him?

729
01:09:47,335 --> 01:09:49,671
Nobody loves you like your family, I guess.

730
01:09:50,004 --> 01:09:51,381
She preserved you, too.

731
01:09:52,382 --> 01:09:55,343
She investigated everyone
who was involved with the...

732
01:09:56,052 --> 01:09:57,178
August 19th.

733
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:58,721
Found you right away.

734
01:09:58,805 --> 01:10:00,325
And she let me live with those people?

735
01:10:00,723 --> 01:10:02,183
You were safer there.

736
01:10:03,518 --> 01:10:06,396
And she knew
there would always come a day.

737
01:10:07,855 --> 01:10:09,357
Jed knows about you, too.

738
01:10:09,899 --> 01:10:11,025
That was some welcome.

739
01:10:13,486 --> 01:10:15,238
He doesn't know who you are.

740
01:10:15,697 --> 01:10:17,448
And the last time a girl got away,

741
01:10:17,532 --> 01:10:19,242
Jed lost his whole family.

742
01:10:19,325 --> 01:10:22,203
So, he'll stay after you.
He doesn't know any better.

743
01:10:22,537 --> 01:10:23,830
Burt Hartman, too.

744
01:10:24,831 --> 01:10:27,333
After reading that police file,

745
01:10:27,417 --> 01:10:30,044
you know this town's dirty little secret.

746
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,425
- Burt. Burt!
- Yeah!

747
01:10:36,926 --> 01:10:37,927
Let me through.

748
01:10:38,177 --> 01:10:39,697
Let's go. I'm getting you out of here.

749
01:10:40,722 --> 01:10:41,806
- Move!
- Hey!

750
01:10:41,889 --> 01:10:43,409
- Out of my way!
- What's your problem?

751
01:10:43,433 --> 01:10:44,892
Use the back door. Yeah, take it!

752
01:10:46,853 --> 01:10:47,895
Burt.

753
01:11:02,493 --> 01:11:03,703
I got her, Burt!

754
01:11:06,622 --> 01:11:07,623
She's right here.

755
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:11,252
You going somewhere, precious?

756
01:11:11,544 --> 01:11:12,587
Huh?

757
01:11:12,754 --> 01:11:13,963
Oh.

758
01:11:16,799 --> 01:11:19,052
She cut me. Burt!

759
01:11:23,765 --> 01:11:25,349
That little bitch.

760
01:11:25,433 --> 01:11:26,976
She won't get far, that's for sure.

761
01:11:28,311 --> 01:11:29,562
Come on. Get up now!

762
01:11:35,443 --> 01:11:38,279
Stop! Stop! Stop!

763
01:11:41,157 --> 01:11:42,158
What's going on?

764
01:11:42,241 --> 01:11:43,493
Burt Hartman and his guys,

765
01:11:43,659 --> 01:11:45,369
they beat up my lawyer at the bar.

766
01:11:45,453 --> 01:11:46,579
And they're after me.

767
01:11:47,997 --> 01:11:49,624
Okay, come on. Let's give you a ride.

768
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,460
We have to stop at the bar.
We have to go back.

769
01:11:52,585 --> 01:11:53,628
Okay.

770
01:12:08,017 --> 01:12:09,310
There he is. That's Farnsworth.

771
01:12:09,477 --> 01:12:10,853
That's the place! Stop the car!

772
01:12:11,312 --> 01:12:12,313
Stop the car!

773
01:12:12,814 --> 01:12:14,023
That's the bar! Stop!

774
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:15,483
Let me out! What are you doing?

775
01:12:18,653 --> 01:12:20,071
Stop the fucking car!

776
01:12:20,363 --> 01:12:21,405
What are you doing?

777
01:12:24,075 --> 01:12:25,076
Yep?

778
01:12:25,243 --> 01:12:27,084
Sawyer girl's loose.
She's headed towards town.

779
01:12:27,495 --> 01:12:29,622
Yeah, yeah. I got her. She's in the back.

780
01:12:29,872 --> 01:12:31,272
What do you want me to do with her?

781
01:12:31,332 --> 01:12:32,959
<i>Tell you what,</i>

782
01:12:33,042 --> 01:12:34,883
<i>take her up to
the slaughterhouse and hold her.</i>

783
01:12:36,003 --> 01:12:38,714
I'm dealing with Ollie. She sliced him good.

784
01:12:39,507 --> 01:12:40,675
<i>Just give me a few minutes.</i>

785
01:12:41,509 --> 01:12:42,552
Okay.

786
01:12:42,844 --> 01:12:43,845
You got it, Dad.

787
01:12:45,471 --> 01:12:46,973
That's your fucking dad?

788
01:12:48,891 --> 01:12:50,434
Fucking stop the car!

789
01:12:50,726 --> 01:12:51,769
Let me out!

790
01:12:52,019 --> 01:12:54,355
Open the door, you liar!

791
01:12:57,859 --> 01:12:59,986
<i>Okay, Marvin, do you copy?</i>

792
01:13:00,236 --> 01:13:01,988
<i>We have the girl from the Carson house.</i>

793
01:13:03,197 --> 01:13:04,657
<i>Come on, Marvin, pick up.</i>

794
01:13:05,449 --> 01:13:07,118
<i>Are you there? Come on, Marvin.</i>

795
01:13:09,996 --> 01:13:12,957
<i>That you, Marvin? If you can hear me,</i>

796
01:13:13,166 --> 01:13:14,727
<i>then meet us out at the slaughterhouse.</i>

797
01:13:31,392 --> 01:13:33,311
Sheriff, I represent Verna Carson's estate

798
01:13:33,394 --> 01:13:34,634
and her granddaughter, Heather.

799
01:13:34,854 --> 01:13:35,813
I know who she is.

800
01:13:35,897 --> 01:13:37,481
Well, at this very moment,
she's in the back of

801
01:13:37,565 --> 01:13:39,567
one of your police cars against her will

802
01:13:39,650 --> 01:13:41,485
heading out of town,
out past Johnny B. Red's.

803
01:13:41,944 --> 01:13:42,945
All right, come with me.

804
01:13:46,949 --> 01:13:48,367
She's headed out Highway 28.

805
01:13:49,535 --> 01:13:50,703
There's nothing out there.

806
01:13:52,955 --> 01:13:55,124
Oh, shit. I know where he's headed.

807
01:14:07,595 --> 01:14:08,596
You know,

808
01:14:10,890 --> 01:14:12,350
I thought you were pretty cute.

809
01:14:22,944 --> 01:14:24,570
So you're a Hartman, huh?

810
01:14:26,781 --> 01:14:27,782
Yep.

811
01:14:30,993 --> 01:14:31,994
Whoa!

812
01:14:35,581 --> 01:14:36,707
I'm a Sawyer.

813
01:14:55,810 --> 01:14:56,811
Please stop!

814
01:15:17,957 --> 01:15:19,125
CARLI Quit it!

815
01:15:30,177 --> 01:15:31,178
Don't tempt me.

816
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:35,975
You should feel
right at home in this nasty place.

817
01:15:36,851 --> 01:15:38,561
Your family used to work this shithole.

818
01:16:46,295 --> 01:16:49,632
We'll take it from here.
No place for a cop, son.

819
01:17:36,470 --> 01:17:37,471
It's me!

820
01:17:37,721 --> 01:17:38,722
It's Heather!

821
01:17:39,473 --> 01:17:40,474
It's your cousin!

822
01:17:40,683 --> 01:17:42,852
It's me! I'm Heather!

823
01:17:43,394 --> 01:17:44,562
Please, it's Heather!

824
01:17:55,698 --> 01:17:57,074
Come here. You remember me?

825
01:18:06,584 --> 01:18:08,586
Come on, Ollie.
Let's feed his ass to the shark.

826
01:18:08,669 --> 01:18:09,670
- Move!
- Hit him, Burt.

827
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,297
Come here! Move your big ass!

828
01:18:12,047 --> 01:18:13,299
Get up there!

829
01:18:15,843 --> 01:18:17,303
You about to die, motherfucker.

830
01:18:17,386 --> 01:18:21,056
Just like your gammy, your sick cousins
and your damn horrible brother.

831
01:18:21,474 --> 01:18:23,350
- Get down! Move!

832
01:18:26,061 --> 01:18:28,272
I'm gonna end the whole
Sawyer bloodline tonight.

833
01:18:28,355 --> 01:18:30,065
You and your pretty bitch cousin.

834
01:18:31,066 --> 01:18:32,546
Atta boy, Burt. Hit him again.

835
01:18:34,195 --> 01:18:36,197
Motherfucker, you're about to die, boy.

836
01:18:37,198 --> 01:18:38,324
Son of a bitch!

837
01:18:38,407 --> 01:18:40,727
- Go get that chain, Ollie.
- All right. I'll get it, Burt.

838
01:18:43,370 --> 01:18:44,872
Grotesque excuse for a man.

839
01:18:45,706 --> 01:18:46,874
You're not gonna get off that easy, boy.

840
01:18:47,291 --> 01:18:48,852
I'm gonna enjoy this shit, you hear me?

841
01:18:49,084 --> 01:18:50,294
- Hurry up, Ollie.
- I got it.

842
01:18:50,544 --> 01:18:51,545
Give me that.

843
01:18:54,548 --> 01:18:56,300
You're about to
get chewed up like a fucking cow!

844
01:18:56,383 --> 01:18:58,552
Fit for a pig meal, is what you'll be.

845
01:19:01,096 --> 01:19:02,598
Turn it on, Ollie and fire it up. Let's go.

846
01:19:02,723 --> 01:19:03,974
All right, Burt. I'm on it!

847
01:19:04,058 --> 01:19:05,059
Bet your ass, boy.

848
01:19:06,101 --> 01:19:07,781
I'm gonna enjoy
watching you get chewed up.

849
01:19:15,486 --> 01:19:16,820
You son of a bitch.

850
01:19:17,071 --> 01:19:18,656
This is my town, you fucking cockroach.

851
01:19:18,739 --> 01:19:19,740
She rolling, Burt!

852
01:19:23,702 --> 01:19:26,080
Out of all you Sawyers, all you sick fucks,

853
01:19:26,163 --> 01:19:27,373
the only one that gets out of the fire

854
01:19:27,456 --> 01:19:28,582
is a fucking retard?

855
01:19:28,791 --> 01:19:29,951
How the fuck did that happen?

856
01:19:32,253 --> 01:19:33,254
You remember me?

857
01:19:46,392 --> 01:19:48,394
You got nine lives? Are you a cat?

858
01:19:48,561 --> 01:19:50,813
You came back. But you're gonna die today,

859
01:19:50,896 --> 01:19:52,457
you motherfucker, just like your daddy.

860
01:19:52,815 --> 01:19:54,275
Your day has come!

861
01:20:05,411 --> 01:20:06,412
Hey!

862
01:20:07,037 --> 01:20:08,038
- Fucker!
- Hey!

863
01:20:08,789 --> 01:20:09,790
Hey!

864
01:20:10,416 --> 01:20:11,458
Oh-ho.

865
01:20:11,542 --> 01:20:12,543
Look who's back.

866
01:20:13,711 --> 01:20:14,920
That's right.

867
01:20:18,424 --> 01:20:19,633
Do your thing, coz.

868
01:20:29,935 --> 01:20:32,021
- You cockroach.

869
01:20:32,104 --> 01:20:33,147
Bitch, you're dead now.

870
01:20:33,564 --> 01:20:35,924
I will fuck you up, you hear me?
You piece of fucking trash.

871
01:21:06,764 --> 01:21:07,885
Oh, thank God, Hooper!

872
01:21:08,265 --> 01:21:09,266
Shoot him!

873
01:21:09,892 --> 01:21:11,602
Come on, shoot him! Shoot him!

874
01:21:11,769 --> 01:21:12,770
Don't shoot!

875
01:21:12,936 --> 01:21:14,355
Hooper! Take him out!

876
01:21:15,648 --> 01:21:17,316
Shoot the fuck. Kill him!

877
01:21:19,234 --> 01:21:21,070
Pull the trigger, you weak son of a bitch!

878
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:22,905
He's gonna kill me!

879
01:21:24,406 --> 01:21:26,075
- Oh, God!
- Don't shoot him!

880
01:21:26,283 --> 01:21:29,119
Hooper! Finish what we started!

881
01:21:56,105 --> 01:21:58,399
Can't get around the Good Book, Burt.

882
01:22:08,909 --> 01:22:10,119
Clean this shit up.

883
01:24:14,993 --> 01:24:16,328
<i>Dearest Granddaughter.</i>

884
01:24:17,788 --> 01:24:21,458
<i>This home and all it
comes with, is now yours.</i>

885
01:24:23,085 --> 01:24:27,005
<i>Just know that these gifts
come with certain burdens.</i>

886
01:24:28,924 --> 01:24:33,262
<i>Your real name is Edith Rose Sawyer.</i>

887
01:24:35,514 --> 01:24:37,349
<i>Farnsworth was instructed to give you</i>

888
01:24:37,516 --> 01:24:39,393
<i>a set of keys to the manor.</i>

889
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:42,062
<i>The large key opens the fortified door</i>

890
01:24:42,145 --> 01:24:43,230
<i>to the wine cellar.</i>

891
01:24:44,022 --> 01:24:47,150
<i>There you will discover a metal door.</i>

892
01:24:47,693 --> 01:24:49,444
<i>Behind it lives your cousin,</i>

893
01:24:50,237 --> 01:24:51,238
<i>Jedidiah Sawyer,</i>

894
01:24:53,323 --> 01:24:56,159
<i>your only remaining blood relative.</i>

895
01:24:56,577 --> 01:24:59,746
<i>He's family-bound and will protect you.</i>

896
01:25:00,664 --> 01:25:03,584
<i>He simply requires your care in return.</i>

897
01:25:06,086 --> 01:25:10,090
<i>Edith, you are the last of my line of Sawyer.</i>

898
01:25:12,259 --> 01:25:14,553
<i>My blood runs through you.</i>

899
01:25:16,430 --> 01:25:19,266
<i>The decision to stay is yours.</i>

900
01:25:20,183 --> 01:25:23,061
<i>Just remember, you're a Sawyer</i>

901
01:25:23,604 --> 01:25:25,439
<i>and this is home.</i>

902
01:26:24,790 --> 01:26:27,417
<i>Now, it's your time.</i>

903
01:31:22,796 --> 01:31:25,465
Now remember, you tell her
that you love her.

904
01:31:27,133 --> 01:31:29,844
For this kind of money, I almost do.
