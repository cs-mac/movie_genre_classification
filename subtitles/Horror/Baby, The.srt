1
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:22,809
Are you a doctor?

2
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:23,810
Yes. Yes.

3
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,312
He's an actor.

4
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,813
Oh, an actor.

5
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,524
We're very popular
with actors.

6
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,817
Have l, uh,
seen you in anything?

7
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,654
Let's see. I did Hamlet a while back,
didn't l, Liz?

8
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:36,323
And then we did, the, uh,
The Sand piper.

9
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,991
He's joking.
He was in Luther

10
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,493
and Nobody Loves An Albatross

11
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,828
and a lot of television
plays and commercials.

12
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:44,331
Well, that's where the money is,
isn't it? Commercials.

13
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,958
And the artistic thrills, too.

14
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,216
7, Diego.

15
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:55,968
Originally,
the smallest apartment was in 9.

16
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,470
They've been broken up
into four, fives, and sixes.

17
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:00,472
Now, 7-E is a four,

18
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:02,558
originally the back
part of a 10.

19
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:05,394
It has the original dining room
for its living room,

20
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,312
another bedroom
for the bedroom,

21
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:08,814
and two servants' rooms
thrown together

22
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,066
for a dining room
or a second bedroom.

23
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,609
Do you have children?

24
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:15,112
Uh, we plan to.

25
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:19,533
We must oil that gate,
Diego.

26
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:23,203
This way, please.

27
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:33,046
The previous tenant,
Mrs. Gardenia,

28
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:35,174
passed away
just a few days ago,

29
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:36,800
so nothing
has been moved yet.

30
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:38,969
Her son asked me to say
that some of the furniture

31
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,346
could be picked up
practically for the asking.

32
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,848
Did she die
in the apartment?

33
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:43,974
Not that it makes
any difference.

34
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,351
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
In a hospital.

35
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,854
She'd been in a coma
for weeks.

36
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,355
After you, please.

37
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,857
Thank you.

38
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:53,859
She was very old

39
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,361
and passed away
without ever waking.

40
00:03:56,403 --> 00:04:01,366
I'd be grateful to go that way myself
when the time comes.

41
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,620
Oh, no, no, no, not
in the apartment, no.

42
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,914
She was chipper
right to the end,

43
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,541
Been one of the first women
lawyers in New York state.

44
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,293
Did a little gardening on
the side, too.

45
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,253
She was quite a woman.

46
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:14,755
Oh, closet.

47
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,174
Oh, plenty of closets.

48
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:20,761
Oh, nice view of the park.

49
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,263
Oh, very nice view.
"I can no longer associate myself"

50
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:24,556
Now, this room, for instance,

51
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,058
it would make
a lovely nursery.

52
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,768
Yes. Yellow and white wallpaper

53
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,770
would brighten it
tremendously.

54
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,772
What are all
these things here?

55
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,273
Herbs, mostly.

56
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:35,150
A nice large bathroom.

57
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,777
Mmm. Mint, basil.

58
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,946
Yeah. No marijuana?

59
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,830
The, uh, master bedroom.

60
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:49,873
Oh, yes.

61
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:52,334
Here we are,
back at the hallway again.

62
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:53,710
There.

63
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,298
Oh...
Oh, Guy!

64
00:04:58,382 --> 00:04:59,299
Yeah.

65
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:00,300
Ohh!

66
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:02,219
The fireplace works,
Of course.

67
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,220
Great.

68
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,721
Oh!

69
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,766
Oh, it's a wonderful apartment.
I love it!

70
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,226
See what she's trying
to do?

71
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,727
She's trying to get you
to lower the rent, see?

72
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,230
Yes. Well, we'd raise it
if we were allowed.

73
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,149
Apartments with
this kind of charm--

74
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,779
Why, that's odd.

75
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,244
There's a closet
behind that secretary.

76
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,247
I'm su--
I'm sure there is.

77
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,250
Yeah. Oh, I think you're right.

78
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,964
She moved it.
It used to be there.

79
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:47,764
Give me
a hand, will you?

80
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,747
I see now why she
went into a coma!

81
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:17,127
She couldn't have lifted it by herself.
She was 89!

82
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,712
Should we open it?

83
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:20,255
Maybe her son should.

84
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,344
I'm authorized
to show the apartment.

85
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,846
Well!

86
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,848
Whatever she locked in
got out.

87
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,351
Well, perhaps she didn't need
five closets.

88
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:36,355
Why would she cover up
her vacuum cleaner and her towels?

89
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,482
I don't suppose
we'll ever know.

90
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,817
Maybe she was becoming
senile after all.

91
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:41,985
Is there anything else?

92
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,321
Yes, please.
What about the laundry facilities?

93
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:45,906
It's bigger
than the other one.

94
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:49,117
Yeah. It's more expensive, too,
you know?

95
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,619
It's better located.

96
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:52,120
Yeah, well, God knows,

97
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,289
I could walk to all
the theaters from here.

98
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,416
Oh, Guy, let's take it,
please?

99
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,835
That living room
could be--

100
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,044
Oh, please,
let's take it.

101
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,964
O.K., darling,
we get out of the other lease, O.K.

102
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:03,966
I was tempted
to write the management

103
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,301
that you were drug addicts
and litterbugs.

104
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:07,803
Instead, I decided to lie

105
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,805
and tell them you
were wonderful tenants.

106
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,306
Oh, you're great, Hutch.

107
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,308
Wish I could talk
you out of it, though.

108
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:14,810
He's pulling
your leg, Ro, honey.

109
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,311
Indeed I'm not.

110
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,188
Now, that looks great.
That is--

111
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,190
Are you aware
that the Bramford

112
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:23,861
had rather an unpleasant reputation
around the turn of the century?

113
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,863
It's where
the Trench sisters

114
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,865
conducted their little
dietary experiments,

115
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,701
and Keith Kennedy
held his parties.

116
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,662
Adrian Marcato lived there, too.
So did Pearl Ames.

117
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:35,747
- Who was Adrian Marcato?
- Who were the Trench sisters?

118
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:38,917
The Trench sisters were two proper
Victorian ladies.

119
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:41,920
They cooked and ate several
young children, including a niece.

120
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:42,921
Oh, lovely.

121
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:45,340
Adrian Marcato
practiced witchcraft.

122
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,010
He made quite a splash
in the nineties

123
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,971
by announcing that he'd
conjured up the living devil.

124
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,472
Apparently,
people believed him,

125
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:54,725
so they attacked
and nearly killed him

126
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,393
in the lobby
of the Bramford.

127
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:57,436
You're joking?

128
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,646
Later, the Keith Kennedy
business began,

129
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,899
and by the twenties,
the house was half empty.

130
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,609
I knew about
Keith Kennedy.

131
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,152
I didn't know that Marcato
lived there.

132
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:06,570
And those sisters.

133
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,780
World War Il filled
the house up again.

134
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:09,781
Terrific.

135
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:11,033
What? The house?

136
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,034
The lamb.

137
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,035
Oh.

138
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,828
They called it
Black Bramford.

139
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,916
But, Hutch, awful things happen
in every apartment house.

140
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:22,336
Ah, but this house has a high incidence
of unpleasant happenings.

141
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,797
In '59, a dead infant was found,

142
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:28,342
wrapped in newspaper
in the basement.

143
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:31,178
Mmm! You really
rouse my appetite.

144
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,263
Have some more wine.

145
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,301
Roman!

146
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:14,805
Bring me in some root beer
when you come!

147
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,675
Hey, these are shelves.

148
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,107
Hey...

149
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:08,692
Iet's make love.

150
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,319
Shh!

151
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:38,824
I think I hear
the Trench sisters chewing.

152
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:40,325
Oh!

153
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,964
Straight up
to the left.

154
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:56,425
Here in Daytona, Florida,

155
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,760
it's the 250-CC
100-Mile Classic

156
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:01,221
with Yamaha leading
the pack on the final lap...

157
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:04,850
and winning it, as Yamaha takes 7
of the top 10 places.

158
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:08,687
It's the third straight year for Yamaha,
a clean sweep.

159
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,814
Yamaha is race bred
from champions,

160
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:12,107
and, as you can see,

161
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:14,026
we have a model for
every kind of riding.

162
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:17,362
You know,you really should
Discover the swingin' world of Yamaha.

163
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:18,697
Why don't you get on,
have a ride?

164
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,948
Come on. Get on.

165
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:21,992
O.K., come on.
Let'sgo.

166
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:28,582
Look.

167
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:36,173
It's great.

168
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:56,318
I'm sorry. I thought
you were Victoria Vetri, the actress.

169
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,319
I'm sorry.

170
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,112
That's all right.

171
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:00,906
A lot of people
think I'm Victoria.

172
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,407
I don't see
any resemblance.

173
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:03,909
Do you know her?

174
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:04,910
No.

175
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:08,580
My name's
Terry Gionoffrio.

176
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:11,583
Nice to meet you.
I'm Rosemary Woodhouse.

177
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,919
Uh, we--we're
new tenants here.

178
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,921
I'm staying with the Castavets,
seventh floor.

179
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,423
I'm their guest, sort of,
Since June.

180
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:20,634
Our apartment used to be
the back part of yours.

181
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:21,760
Oh, for goodness sakes.

182
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:23,554
You took the old lady's apartment.
Mrs., uh...

183
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,389
Yeah, um, Miss, uh...
Gard--Gardenia.

184
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:26,431
Gardenia. Yeah.

185
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:28,225
She was a good friend
of the Castavets.

186
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,811
She used to grow all kinds of herbs
and things for her to cook with.

187
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:31,854
I saw those plants.

188
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,772
Yeah. Well, now,
she grows her own things.

189
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:37,359
Excuse me a moment.
I have to put the softener in.

190
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:38,527
What does
your husband do?

191
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:39,528
He's an actor.

192
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:41,822
No kidding?
What's his name?

193
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,490
Guy Woodhouse.

194
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:46,493
He was in Luther
and Nobody Loves an Albatross,

195
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:49,162
and he does a lot
of television and radio.

196
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:51,498
Gee, I watch TV
all day long.

197
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:53,166
I bet I've seen him.

198
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:55,169
Wow!

199
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:56,503
Ooh!

200
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:58,005
I hate this basement.

201
00:13:58,088 --> 00:13:59,506
Yeah, me, too.

202
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,341
It gives me the creeps.

203
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:03,177
Listen, why don't we come down here
regular together

204
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:04,469
and do our laundry?

205
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:05,971
O.K., that would be great.

206
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,306
I have a good luck charm.

207
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:10,434
It might work
for both of us.

208
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:11,935
Oh, that's beautiful.

209
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:12,936
Isn't it?

210
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:15,272
Mrs. Castavet
gave it to me.

211
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,398
It's good luck.

212
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:17,941
Anyway, it's supposed to be.

213
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,943
It's got some
stuff inside.

214
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,283
I'm not mad about
the smell either.

215
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,618
I hope it works.

216
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:28,952
It's a beautiful charm, though.

217
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:30,954
I've never seen
anything like it.

218
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:32,331
European.

219
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,541
The Castavets are the most wonderful
people in the world,

220
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:35,459
bar none.

221
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,336
You know, they picked me up
Off the sidewalk, literally?

222
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:38,337
You were sick?

223
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,256
I was starving and on dope

224
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:42,591
and doing a lot
of other things.

225
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:44,092
They're childless, though.

226
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:45,594
I'm like the daughter
they never had.

227
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:47,763
At first, I thought they
wanted me for some kind of sex thing,

228
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:50,265
but they've turned out to be
like real grandparents.

229
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:53,185
It's nice to know
there are people like that

230
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:55,562
when you hear
so much about apathy

231
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:57,606
and people who are afraid
of getting involved.

232
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:00,067
I'd be dead now
if it wasn't for them.

233
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,819
That's an absolute fact,
dead or in jail.

234
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:06,031
You don't have any family
that could have helped you?

235
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,199
A brother in the Navy.

236
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:10,536
Why, it's impossible
to be 100% sure!

237
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:12,329
If you want my opinion,

238
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,581
we shouldn't tell her at all!

239
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:15,666
That's my opinion!

240
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,751
That must be
the partition.

241
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:21,922
That's the back part
of the original 10 with a dining room,

242
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:24,216
and there's--
there's a closet over here,

243
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:26,718
and then there's
a closet over here.

244
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:06,425
Stay back, huh, lady?

245
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:15,976
Get back now,
will you, please?

246
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:17,936
Get back.
There's nothing to see.

247
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,731
Get back,
will you, please?

248
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,026
Jesus.

249
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:25,194
Get back!

250
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:26,695
We know her.

251
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:28,197
What's her name?

252
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,531
Terry.

253
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:30,616
Terry what?

254
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:32,659
Ro?

255
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:35,662
What was her name again?
Terry what?

256
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:37,998
I don't remember.
An ltalian name.

257
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:40,501
She was staying with some people
named Castavet,

258
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:41,502
7-E.

259
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:43,378
Yeah. We got that already.

260
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:45,214
Short and sweet.

261
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:48,175
She stuck it to the window sill
with a band-aid.

262
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:49,051
Come on. Get back.

263
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:50,552
Theresa Gionoffrio.

264
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:51,720
Move on!

265
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:52,846
Move on!

266
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,058
You knew her?

267
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:57,059
Only slightly.

268
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:59,061
Come on, Ro baby.
Let's go.

269
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:00,687
Oh! Here they come.

270
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:06,235
You folks the Castavets
on the seventh floor?

271
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:07,236
We are.

272
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,614
You have a young woman named
Theresa Gionoffrio living with you?

273
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,783
We do. What's wrong?
Has there been an accident?

274
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,285
You'd better brace yourself
for some bad news.

275
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,286
She's dead.

276
00:17:17,496 --> 00:17:19,039
Jumped out
of the window.

277
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:21,542
That's not possible!
It's a mistake!

278
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:26,380
Artie, you want to let these folks
take a look, please?

279
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,258
I knew this would happen.

280
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:32,344
She got deeply depressed
every three weeks or so.

281
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:35,305
I told my wife about it,
but she pooh-poohed me.

282
00:17:36,265 --> 00:17:39,226
Well, that--that doesn't
mean she killed herself.

283
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:40,853
She was a very happy girl

284
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,855
with no reason
for self-destruction.

285
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,399
She must have been cleaning
the windows or something.

286
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:47,359
She wasn't cleaning
windows at midnight.

287
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:48,861
Why not? Maybe she was!

288
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:50,362
Is that her handwriting?

289
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:53,866
Yeah.

290
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,117
Definitely.
Absolutely.

291
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:56,410
Thank you.

292
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,871
I'll see this gets back
to you when we're done with it.

293
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:01,290
I don't believe it.
I just don't believe it.

294
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:02,791
She was so happy.

295
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,710
Who's the next-of-kin?

296
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:06,378
She's all alone.
She didn't have anybody,

297
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:07,379
only us.

298
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:08,881
Didn't she
have a brother?

299
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:09,882
Did she?

300
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:12,384
She said she did.
In the Navy.

301
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:13,886
News to me.

302
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:15,888
Do you know where he's stationed?

303
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:17,055
No, I don't.

304
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:20,267
She mentioned him to me
in the laundry room.

305
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:21,727
I'm Rosemary Woodhouse.

306
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,229
Uh, we're in,
uh, 7-E.

307
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:26,732
I feel just the way you do,
Mrs. Castavet.

308
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:29,234
She seemed so happy
and full of--

309
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:32,237
She said wonderful things about you
and your husband,

310
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:33,238
how grateful she was.

311
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:34,823
Thank you.

312
00:18:34,907 --> 00:18:36,742
You know anything else
about this brother

313
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:37,826
except he's
in the Navy?

314
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:38,869
No, I don't.

315
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:40,746
It should be easy
to find him.

316
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,541
I'm so stunned.
I'm so sorry.

317
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,501
It's such a pity.

318
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:47,503
Well, thank you.

319
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:31,922
Sometimes I wonder how come
you're the leader of anything.

320
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:41,014
Please don't tell me
what Laura-Louise said

321
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:42,516
because I'm not interested.

322
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:44,810
If you'd listened to me,

323
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:46,186
we wouldn't have
had to do this!

324
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:47,813
We'd have been
all set to go now

325
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:50,649
instead of having to start
all over from scratch!

326
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:52,818
I told you not to
tell her in advance!

327
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:55,863
I told you she wouldn't
be open-minded!

328
00:19:57,948 --> 00:20:00,909
I told Sister Veronica
about the windows,

329
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:02,661
and she withdrew the school
from the competition.

330
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:03,871
Otherwise, we would--

331
00:20:11,837 --> 00:20:13,255
Hello. How are you?

332
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:14,840
Fine. May I come in a minute?

333
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:16,300
Yes, of course. Please do.

334
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:17,801
I just come over
to thank you

335
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:19,303
for saying those nice things to us
the other night.

336
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:20,804
Oh, no, please.
There's--

337
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:22,973
Poor Terry. We thought
maybe we'd failed her some way,

338
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,726
although her note made it crystal clear
we hadn't.

339
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:27,603
You'll never know
how helpful it was

340
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:29,229
in such a shock moment.

341
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:31,440
So I do thank you.
Roman does, too.

342
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:32,482
Roman's my hubby.

343
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:34,818
You're welcome.
I'm glad I could help.

344
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:38,447
Yeah. Well, she was cremated yesterday.

345
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,699
Now we got to forget and go on.
It won't be easy.

346
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:42,618
We don't have any children of our own.
You have any?

347
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:43,619
No, we don't.

348
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:45,120
Oh, well,
there you have it.

349
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:48,957
Ohh! Oh...
that's a nice--

350
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:51,668
Look how you put the table!
Now, isn't that interesting?

351
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:52,920
I saw it in a magazine.

352
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:55,339
Oh, my. Nice paintjob.

353
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:56,507
I know.

354
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,342
Ahh...well.

355
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:01,011
That's nice. What is that?
That's the TV room?

356
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:02,304
Yeah, well,
only temporarily.

357
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:04,139
It's going
to be a nursery.

358
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:05,307
Oh, you're pregnant?

359
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:06,475
No, not yet.

360
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:08,435
I hope to be as soon
as we're settled.

361
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:10,020
Wonderful.
Well, you're young and healthy.

362
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:11,313
You ought to have
lots ofchildren.

363
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:12,814
We plan to have three.

364
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:14,608
I'm dying to see what you did
to this apartment.

365
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:16,818
The woman who had it before
was a dear friend of mine.

366
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,320
I know.
Terry told me.

367
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:19,655
Well, did she?

368
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:22,157
You two had some long talks together
in the laundry room.

369
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:23,200
Only one.

370
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:24,701
Oh! Oh, my goodness!

371
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:27,204
Ah ha ha!
It looks so much brighter.

372
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,333
What do you pay
for a chair like that?

373
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:35,128
Um, I'm not sure, really.
I think about $200.

374
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,340
What does your hubby do?

375
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:39,842
He's an actor.

376
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:43,345
I knew it!
I said it to Roman yesterday.

377
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:45,138
He's so good-looking.

378
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,140
What movies was he in?

379
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:48,058
No movies.

380
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:49,852
He was in two plays
called Luther

381
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:51,436
and Nobody Loves an Albatross

382
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,355
and a lot of television
and radio.

383
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:54,356
Listen, Rosemary...

384
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:56,900
I got a 2-inch thick
sirloin steak

385
00:21:56,942 --> 00:21:58,819
sitting defrosting
right this minute.

386
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:01,196
Why don't you and Guy come over,
have supper with us tonight?

387
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:02,114
What do you say?

388
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:03,615
Oh, no. We couldn't.

389
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:04,783
Why not?

390
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:06,869
No, really, that's very kind of you.
Listen--

391
00:22:06,952 --> 00:22:09,788
It would be a real help to us.
Oh...

392
00:22:09,872 --> 00:22:11,790
first night we'll be alone since...

393
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,377
Oh, are you sure it wouldn't be
too much trouble for you?

394
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:17,754
Oh, honey, if it was trouble,
I wouldn't ask you.

395
00:22:17,838 --> 00:22:19,506
All right.
You go ahead and count on us.

396
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,841
I'll have to check with Guy,
though.

397
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:24,428
Listen, you tell him
I won't take no for an answer!

398
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:25,971
Oh! Here's your mail!

399
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:26,972
Oh! Ads!

400
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:27,973
Thank you.

401
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:39,193
Yoo-hoo!

402
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:42,112
Hey.

403
00:22:42,154 --> 00:22:43,780
Mmm!

404
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:58,462
Donald Baumgart
got that part.

405
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:12,559
It's a bad play anyway.

406
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:14,061
Yeah. Even if it folds out of town,

407
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:16,438
it's the kind of part
that gets noticed.

408
00:23:22,653 --> 00:23:24,071
Mrs. Castavet was here

409
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:28,075
to thank me for what
I said about Terry.

410
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:31,411
She is the nosiest
person I've ever seen.

411
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:34,331
You know she actually
asked the prices of things?

412
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:35,582
No kidding.

413
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,920
She invited us to have dinner
with them tonight.

414
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:41,672
I told her I'd have
to check with you,

415
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:43,549
but that it would
probably be O.K.

416
00:23:43,632 --> 00:23:46,635
Oh, Jesus! We don't have to do that,
do we, honey?

417
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:47,803
I think they're lonely.

418
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:50,389
We get friendly with
an old couple like that,

419
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:51,348
and we'll never
get rid of them.

420
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:53,058
They're right
across the wall.

421
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:55,686
I told her she
could count on us.

422
00:23:58,939 --> 00:24:00,399
You don't have
to sulk about it.

423
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:01,775
I'm not sulking.

424
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:03,944
I see exactly
what you mean.

425
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:04,945
Hell, we'll go.

426
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:06,446
No, no. What for?

427
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,614
We'll go!

428
00:24:07,698 --> 00:24:10,868
No. We don't have to
if you don't want to.

429
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:14,121
That sounds so phony,
but I really mean it, really, I do.

430
00:24:15,372 --> 00:24:17,249
Be my good deed
for the day.

431
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:21,378
O.K., but only if you want to.

432
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:23,839
We'll make it clear that it's just
for this one night

433
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:26,049
and not the beginning
of anything, all right?

434
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:28,552
Oh! Perfect timing!
Come on in.

435
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:31,054
Roman's fixing us
some vodka blushes.

436
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:33,724
My, I'm glad you could come, Guy.

437
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:36,268
I'm fixing to tell everybody
that I knew you when.

438
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:37,978
Look, dinner isn't ready
just yet,

439
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:39,521
but sit down there
anywhere.

440
00:24:39,605 --> 00:24:40,689
Take a seat
on the couch.

441
00:24:40,772 --> 00:24:42,191
You'll find yourself
very comfortable.

442
00:24:42,274 --> 00:24:44,526
I seem to have
overfilled the glasses.

443
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,528
No, no, no.
Don't get up.

444
00:24:46,612 --> 00:24:50,157
Generally, I pour these out precisely
as a bartender, don't l, Minnie?

445
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,200
Just watch
the carpet.

446
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:53,035
But this evening I made
a little too much,

447
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:55,537
and rather I'm afr--
Oh, there we are.

448
00:24:55,621 --> 00:24:56,705
No, no, no.
Sit down, please.

449
00:24:56,788 --> 00:24:58,040
Now, Mrs. Woodhouse...

450
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:01,460
Uh, Mr. Woodhouse,
uh, vodka blush?

451
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:02,461
Yes, thanks.

452
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:03,962
Have you ever
tasted one?

453
00:25:04,046 --> 00:25:05,464
No, no.
I haven't.

454
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:06,507
It looks delicious.

455
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,967
Minnie. They're very
popular in Australia.

456
00:25:09,051 --> 00:25:11,637
Now, to our guests--
welcome to our home.

457
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,638
Hear, hear.

458
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:13,639
Cheers.

459
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:14,765
Mmm.

460
00:25:17,768 --> 00:25:19,478
The carpet.

461
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:20,896
Oh, dear.

462
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:22,481
Brand-new carpet.

463
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:25,817
This man
is so clumsy!

464
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:27,986
Do you come
from Australia?

465
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:31,490
Oh, no, no. I'm from
right here in New York city.

466
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:32,991
I've been there, though.

467
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:34,493
I've been everywhere,
literally.

468
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:37,496
You name a place,
and I've been there.

469
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:38,997
Go ahead. Name a place.

470
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:40,499
Fairbanks, Alaska!

471
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:43,001
I've been there,
been all over Alaska--

472
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:47,381
Yes--Fairbanks, Juneau, Anchorage,
Nome, Sitka, Seward.

473
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:49,174
I spent four months
there in '38--

474
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:50,342
Where are
you folks from?

475
00:25:50,425 --> 00:25:51,844
Well--Well, l--

476
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:54,346
I'm from Omaha.
Guy's from Baltimore.

477
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:56,515
Omaha's a good city.
Baltimore is, too.

478
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:58,934
Do you travel
for business?

479
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:00,853
Well, business
and pleasure both.

480
00:26:00,936 --> 00:26:03,981
I'm 79, and I've been going one place
or another since I was 10.

481
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:06,149
You name a place,
I've been there.

482
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:07,317
Ah! Steak's ready.

483
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:09,319
Don't rush your drinks, now.

484
00:26:10,112 --> 00:26:12,072
Roman, take your pill!

485
00:26:12,114 --> 00:26:16,159
No Pope ever visits a city where
the newspapers are on strike.

486
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:18,996
I heard he's going to postpone
and wait till it's over.

487
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,998
Well, that's show biz.

488
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:24,543
That's exactly what it is.

489
00:26:24,585 --> 00:26:26,503
All the costumes
are rituals,

490
00:26:26,545 --> 00:26:27,671
all religions.

491
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:30,048
Oh, I think we're offending Rosemary.

492
00:26:30,132 --> 00:26:30,841
No, no.

493
00:26:30,883 --> 00:26:33,010
No, you're not religious,
my dear, are you?

494
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:35,053
Well, l--I was brought up a Catholic.

495
00:26:35,095 --> 00:26:36,555
Now I don't know.

496
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:38,056
You looked
uncomfortable.

497
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:39,558
Well, he is the Pope.

498
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,060
Now, you don't need
to have respect for him

499
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:44,021
because he pretends
that he's holy.

500
00:26:44,104 --> 00:26:45,272
Now, that's a good point.

501
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:48,775
When I think what they spend
on robes and jewels!

502
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:52,779
A good picture of the hypocrisy
behind organized religion

503
00:26:52,863 --> 00:26:54,323
was given, I thought,
in Luther.

504
00:26:54,364 --> 00:26:57,117
Did you ever get to play
that leading part, Guy?

505
00:26:57,201 --> 00:26:58,327
Me? No.

506
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:00,579
Weren't you Albert Finney's
understudy?

507
00:27:00,913 --> 00:27:01,955
No.

508
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,207
Well, that's strange.

509
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:05,375
I remember being struck
by a gesture you made

510
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:06,877
and checking in the program

511
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,378
to see who you were.

512
00:27:08,712 --> 00:27:10,130
Um, what gesture
was that?

513
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:13,967
Well, I'm not sure now.
It was a reaction--

514
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:17,387
Oh, I did a thing with my arms
when Luther was having a fit.

515
00:27:17,471 --> 00:27:19,431
It was a kind of
involuntary reach.

516
00:27:19,473 --> 00:27:23,727
That's it! That's it.
It had a wonderful authenticity to it.

517
00:27:24,353 --> 00:27:26,647
Oh, come on.
-No, no. I mean it!

518
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:29,149
My father was
a theatrical producer,

519
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:31,944
and my early years
were spent in the company

520
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:34,988
of Mrs. Fiske, Forbes-Robertson,
Modjeska.

521
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,156
Guy?

522
00:27:36,198 --> 00:27:37,658
Oh, yes, please.

523
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:40,827
You have a most interesting
inner quality, Guy.

524
00:27:40,911 --> 00:27:43,247
It appears in your
television work, too.

525
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,165
It should take you
a long way, indeed,

526
00:27:45,249 --> 00:27:48,460
provided, of course,
that you get those initial breaks.

527
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:51,588
Are you preparing
for a show now?

528
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:54,591
Um, well,
I'm up for a couple parts.

529
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:57,094
Well, I can't believe
that you won't get them.

530
00:27:57,177 --> 00:27:58,512
Well, I can.

531
00:27:58,554 --> 00:28:01,515
I'd like to have
a spice garden someday.

532
00:28:01,557 --> 00:28:03,934
I guess I'm a country girl
at heart.

533
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:06,186
You come from a big family?

534
00:28:06,562 --> 00:28:07,980
Three brothers
and two sisters.

535
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:09,481
Your sisters married?

536
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:11,775
They have children?

537
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:13,777
One has two,
the other has four.

538
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:16,280
There's a chance you'll have
lots of children, too.

539
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:17,781
We're fertile, all right.

540
00:28:18,657 --> 00:28:21,076
I've got 16
nieces and nephews.

541
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:22,661
Oh, my goodness!

542
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:30,377
Would you like me to wash
and you can wipe for a while?

543
00:28:30,502 --> 00:28:31,962
Oh, no.
That's fine, dear.

544
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:43,348
Now, Roman, will you stop
bending Guy's ears

545
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,850
with your Modjeska stories?

546
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:47,352
He's only listening
'cause he's polite.

547
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:49,354
No, no, no, no.
It's very interesting, Mrs. Castavet.

548
00:28:49,438 --> 00:28:52,065
Minnie!
I'm Minnie, he's Roman, O.K.?

549
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:53,483
O.K.?

550
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:54,651
O.K.

551
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:55,819
O.K.!

552
00:28:55,903 --> 00:28:57,153
Terrific.
Just terrific.

553
00:28:57,154 --> 00:28:58,280
Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye.

554
00:28:58,363 --> 00:28:59,448
Thank you
for having us.

555
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:01,241
Yeah, it was lovely.
Oh, bless you.

556
00:29:01,325 --> 00:29:02,409
Minnie!

557
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:03,952
Minnie, ya good kid, ya.

558
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:06,747
Ooh!
About that steak, huh?

559
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,749
Oh, my God!
And the cake.

560
00:29:08,832 --> 00:29:11,460
How did you eat two pieces?
It was weird.

561
00:29:11,502 --> 00:29:13,086
Out of politeness.
That's how I ate two pieces.

562
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,338
Out of politeness.

563
00:29:15,923 --> 00:29:18,342
Only three dinner plates
that matched.

564
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:20,010
Shh!

565
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:22,763
And all that beautiful,
beautiful silver.

566
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:24,681
We'll be nice.
Maybe they'll will it to us.

567
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:26,767
Oh!
Yeah.

568
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,602
Guess what they have
in their bathroom.

569
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:29,770
A bidet.

570
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:31,271
Jokes for the John.

571
00:29:31,355 --> 00:29:32,439
No.

572
00:29:32,523 --> 00:29:34,441
A book on a hook
right next to the toilet.

573
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:37,694
Roman's stories are pretty damned
interesting, though.

574
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:38,820
Yeah?

575
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,698
Never even heard
of Forbes-Robertson before.

576
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:43,700
I'm going to go over there
again tomorrow night

577
00:29:43,784 --> 00:29:45,202
and hear some more.

578
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:46,286
You are?

579
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,371
Yeah. He asked me.

580
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:49,122
Here. Do this damn thing for me,
will you?

581
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:51,291
I thought we were going to do something
With Joan and Dick Jellico.

582
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:53,710
- Was that definite?
- Well, it wasn't definite.

583
00:29:53,794 --> 00:29:55,963
We'll see them next week.

584
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:59,216
You don't have to come along
If you don't want to.

585
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:00,717
You can stay here.

586
00:30:02,302 --> 00:30:05,222
Yeah, I think I will stay here.

587
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:07,224
He knew Henry lrving, too.

588
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:09,393
I mean,
really interesting, you know?

589
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:12,396
Why did they take
their pictures down?

590
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:13,564
What do you mean?

591
00:30:13,647 --> 00:30:15,482
Their pictures.
They took them down.

592
00:30:15,566 --> 00:30:17,985
The hooks in the wall
and clean spaces

593
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:20,821
and the one picture
that is there doesn't fit.

594
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:22,239
I didn't notice that.

595
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,945
Hi, dear.
We're not bothering you, are we?

596
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:03,947
This is my dear friend
Laura-Louise McBurney,

597
00:31:04,031 --> 00:31:05,449
Lives up on 12.

598
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:07,951
Laura-Louise,
this is Guy's wife Rosemary.

599
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:09,453
Hello, Rosemary.
Welcome to the Bram!

600
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:12,456
Laura-Louise just met Guy.
She wanted to meet you, too.

601
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:13,957
Could we come in?

602
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:15,459
Uh, of course. Please do.

603
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:17,461
There you are.
Go ahead.

604
00:31:17,544 --> 00:31:20,297
Oh, look what you got.
There's a light.

605
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:24,635
Oh, gosh!
Isn't that beautiful!

606
00:31:25,302 --> 00:31:26,386
It came this morning.

607
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,222
Are you all right, dear?
You look worn.

608
00:31:28,305 --> 00:31:31,225
Oh, no. I'm fine.
It's the first day of my period.

609
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:32,809
And you're up and around?

610
00:31:32,893 --> 00:31:34,811
On my first day,
I experienced such pain,

611
00:31:34,895 --> 00:31:36,313
I couldn't move, eat,
or anything.

612
00:31:37,731 --> 00:31:40,817
Dan used to give me gin
through a straw to kill the pain.

613
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:43,737
Girls today take things
much more in their stride.

614
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,739
They're much healthier
than we were,

615
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:48,283
Thanks to vitamins, better medical care.

616
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:50,452
What are those things over there,
seat covers?

617
00:31:50,536 --> 00:31:52,371
Um, cushions for the window seats.

618
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:53,997
Oh, yeah.

619
00:31:58,168 --> 00:32:00,045
Oh, before I forget.

620
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,341
This is for you
from Roman and me.

621
00:32:04,424 --> 00:32:05,884
For me?

622
00:32:05,926 --> 00:32:08,929
It's just a little present is all.
For moving in.

623
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:09,763
There's no reason--

624
00:32:09,847 --> 00:32:12,307
It's real old.
It's over 300 years.

625
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,400
It's lovely.

626
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:24,403
Yeah. The green inside
is called tannis root.

627
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:25,904
That's for good luck.

628
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:29,449
It's lovely, but l--
I can't accept it.

629
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:30,951
You already have.

630
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:33,579
Put it on.
-Yeah.

631
00:32:34,955 --> 00:32:38,625
Ah, you'll get used to the smell
before you know it.

632
00:32:38,709 --> 00:32:40,169
Yeah, go on.

633
00:32:41,295 --> 00:32:44,381
Ohh, yes.

634
00:32:45,757 --> 00:32:48,385
Well, were his stories
as interesting as last night?

635
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:50,429
Yes. Did you have a good time?

636
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,597
All right.

637
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:53,098
I got a present.

638
00:32:54,975 --> 00:32:56,435
It was Terry's.

639
00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:57,603
No kidding?

640
00:32:57,644 --> 00:32:59,104
Kind of pretty, though.

641
00:33:02,941 --> 00:33:05,360
Aren't you going to wear it?

642
00:33:05,444 --> 00:33:06,528
It smells.

643
00:33:07,196 --> 00:33:09,239
There's stuff in it
called tannis root

644
00:33:09,323 --> 00:33:10,741
from her greenhouse.

645
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:12,242
Not too bad, though.

646
00:33:22,211 --> 00:33:23,295
Tannis, anyone?

647
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:25,047
Well, if you took it,

648
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:27,424
you ought to wear it.

649
00:33:45,067 --> 00:33:46,151
Hello.

650
00:33:46,235 --> 00:33:47,319
Yes.

651
00:33:47,402 --> 00:33:48,820
This is he.

652
00:33:55,077 --> 00:33:57,538
Oh, God, no.

653
00:33:59,581 --> 00:34:01,083
Oh, the poor guy.

654
00:34:02,251 --> 00:34:03,335
And, uh...

655
00:34:03,418 --> 00:34:06,338
They don't have any idea
what's causing it?

656
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:08,340
Oh, my God.
That's awful.

657
00:34:08,423 --> 00:34:09,925
That's just awful.

658
00:34:12,094 --> 00:34:13,512
Yes, I would.

659
00:34:13,595 --> 00:34:15,514
I mean, yes, I am.

660
00:34:17,015 --> 00:34:19,977
I hate to get it
that way, but...

661
00:34:22,145 --> 00:34:24,106
Well, you'd have
to speak to my agent

662
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:26,191
about that end of it.

663
00:34:27,651 --> 00:34:29,111
Alan Stone.

664
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:30,821
I'm sure there won't be any problem,
Mr. Weiss,

665
00:34:30,904 --> 00:34:33,365
not as far as
we're concerned.

666
00:34:34,157 --> 00:34:35,701
Thank you, Mr. Weiss.

667
00:34:39,955 --> 00:34:41,206
Guy?

668
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:44,585
What is it?

669
00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:51,717
Donald Baumgart--
he's gone blind.

670
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:55,220
He woke up yesterday
and he can't see.

671
00:34:55,262 --> 00:34:56,346
Oh, no.

672
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,390
Oh, I've got the part.

673
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,811
It's a hell of a way
to get it.

674
00:35:07,524 --> 00:35:08,609
Listen, uh...

675
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:10,152
I have to get out
and walk around.

676
00:35:10,235 --> 00:35:11,653
I understand.
Go ahead.

677
00:35:22,581 --> 00:35:25,542
Baumgart--
Donald Baumgart.

678
00:35:27,628 --> 00:35:29,213
It's a fascinating part.

679
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:31,215
He'll really
be noticed this time.

680
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:33,217
He also has an offer
for a lead

681
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,719
in a television
series, Miami Beach.

682
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:37,221
He's suddenly very hot.

683
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:40,766
Mm-hmm. I understand
why you're so overjoyed.

684
00:35:40,849 --> 00:35:44,228
Well, it's a difficult
period in his life.

685
00:35:44,311 --> 00:35:45,395
A challenge.

686
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,564
I see.

687
00:35:47,648 --> 00:35:49,066
You know how actors are.

688
00:35:49,149 --> 00:35:51,568
They're all a bit
self-centered.

689
00:35:51,652 --> 00:35:53,570
I'll bet even
Laurence Olivier

690
00:35:53,654 --> 00:35:55,572
is vain
and self-centered.

691
00:35:56,823 --> 00:35:58,242
It's a difficult part.

692
00:35:58,325 --> 00:36:00,744
He's got to work
with crutches

693
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:03,205
and, naturally,
he's preoccupied.

694
00:36:03,247 --> 00:36:04,706
And he...

695
00:36:04,748 --> 00:36:07,543
well, preoccupied.

696
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,631
I see you had another suicide
up there at happy house.

697
00:36:12,673 --> 00:36:14,132
Oh, didn't I tell you?

698
00:36:14,174 --> 00:36:15,634
No, you didn't.

699
00:36:15,676 --> 00:36:17,302
It was that girl
I told you about,

700
00:36:17,386 --> 00:36:20,347
the drug-addict who was rehabilitated
by this old couple, the Castavets.

701
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:21,807
I'm sure I told you that.

702
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:24,351
They didn't rehabilitate her
very successfully,

703
00:36:24,393 --> 00:36:25,644
it seems.

704
00:36:46,915 --> 00:36:48,375
I've been a creep.

705
00:36:49,668 --> 00:36:51,712
It's from worrying if Baumgart
would regain his sight,

706
00:36:51,753 --> 00:36:53,213
rat that I am.

707
00:36:53,255 --> 00:36:54,006
Oh, it's natural.

708
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:55,883
You're bound to feel
two ways about it.

709
00:36:55,924 --> 00:36:57,885
Even if I'm Mr. Yamaha
for the rest of my days,

710
00:36:57,926 --> 00:36:59,887
I'm going to stop giving you
the short end of the stick.

711
00:36:59,928 --> 00:37:00,721
You haven't been.

712
00:37:00,762 --> 00:37:01,346
Yes, I have.

713
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:04,141
I've been tearing my hair out
over my career.

714
00:37:04,308 --> 00:37:06,226
Let's have a baby.
All right?

715
00:37:06,894 --> 00:37:09,813
Let's have three babies, one at a time,
all right?

716
00:37:09,897 --> 00:37:11,315
A baby. You know.

717
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:13,317
Mama, dada, poo-poo.
you know?

718
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,818
You mean it?

719
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:16,320
Sure, I mean it.

720
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:18,155
I mean, I even figured out
the right time to start,

721
00:37:18,238 --> 00:37:19,323
Look.

722
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:21,825
You mean it, really?

723
00:37:23,493 --> 00:37:26,413
No, I'm kidding.
Sure, I mean it.

724
00:37:26,496 --> 00:37:29,374
Oh, Ro, honey, for God's sake,
don't cry.

725
00:37:29,499 --> 00:37:32,336
I won't. I won't.

726
00:37:36,256 --> 00:37:37,674
Here goes nothing.

727
00:37:49,394 --> 00:37:50,812
Mmm-unh! The paint!

728
00:37:50,896 --> 00:37:52,523
The paint!

729
00:37:52,606 --> 00:37:53,899
Good grief.

730
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:06,495
Nobody, but nobody
has a fire tonight.

731
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:13,502
Isn't it gorgeous?

732
00:38:13,544 --> 00:38:16,547
I hope we have
the coldest winter ever.

733
00:38:32,521 --> 00:38:34,064
Oh, shit!

734
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:43,031
Hi, Guy! How are ya?

735
00:38:43,073 --> 00:38:45,033
No, don't let her in.

736
00:38:45,075 --> 00:38:46,034
Not tonight.

737
00:38:46,076 --> 00:38:49,037
Oh, that's very kind of you.

738
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:57,004
Oh, are you sure
you don't want to come in?

739
00:38:57,005 --> 00:38:57,588
No! I don't want
to bother you.

740
00:38:59,631 --> 00:39:00,924
Good.

741
00:39:02,843 --> 00:39:03,635
Good.

742
00:39:04,011 --> 00:39:06,763
Who says
there's nothing to ESP?

743
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:09,641
Madame and monsieur shall
have ze dessert after all!

744
00:39:09,683 --> 00:39:11,101
Mousse au chocolat.

745
00:39:11,185 --> 00:39:13,604
Or as Minnie calls it--
chocolate mouse.

746
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:17,065
I was afraid she'd stay
all evening.

747
00:39:17,149 --> 00:39:19,067
She just wanted us
to try it.

748
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:21,612
Seein' it's one of her specialities.

749
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:23,238
It was sweet of her, really.

750
00:39:23,322 --> 00:39:24,573
We shouldn't
make fun of her.

751
00:39:24,656 --> 00:39:26,617
Yeah, you're right,
you're right, you're right.

752
00:39:38,795 --> 00:39:41,381
Mmm! It's good.

753
00:39:56,647 --> 00:39:59,566
Has an undertaste.

754
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:01,777
A chalky undertaste.

755
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,239
I don't get it.

756
00:40:06,949 --> 00:40:09,243
That's silly, honey.
There is no undertaste.

757
00:40:09,326 --> 00:40:10,494
There is.

758
00:40:11,453 --> 00:40:14,665
Come on. The old bat slaved all day.
Now eat it.

759
00:40:14,748 --> 00:40:16,708
-I don't like it.
-It's delicious.

760
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:18,460
Here. You can have mine.

761
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:20,796
All right. Don't eat it.
There's always something wrong.

762
00:40:21,922 --> 00:40:24,341
Oh, if it's going to turn
into a big thing--

763
00:40:24,424 --> 00:40:25,676
Look, if you really
can't stand it,

764
00:40:25,759 --> 00:40:27,177
just don't eat it.

765
00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:31,181
Mmm! It's delicious!
No undertaste at all.

766
00:40:32,307 --> 00:40:34,935
Would you turn
the record over, please?

767
00:40:48,156 --> 00:40:50,576
There, Daddy,
do I get a gold star?

768
00:40:50,659 --> 00:40:52,578
You get two of them.

769
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:54,538
I'm sorry
if I was stuffy.

770
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:56,081
You were.

771
00:40:56,164 --> 00:40:58,125
...is making a full circle
of the ball park...

772
00:40:58,166 --> 00:40:59,626
It's the Pope
at Yankee Stadium!

773
00:40:59,668 --> 00:41:01,461
...to his specially built
canopy at second base.

774
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:02,963
Put him out!

775
00:41:03,005 --> 00:41:04,965
Listen to that crowd roar.

776
00:41:05,007 --> 00:41:06,967
Everywhere the Pope
Has been today,

777
00:41:07,009 --> 00:41:08,468
he's received this type
of reception.

778
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,971
As one man put it
This afternoon,

779
00:41:11,013 --> 00:41:12,973
"Perhaps we are being
undignified,

780
00:41:13,015 --> 00:41:14,474
but this is
a special day. "

781
00:41:14,558 --> 00:41:15,976
And a special day
it has been.

782
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:18,979
That's a great spot
for my Yamaha commercial.

783
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:23,150
I'd like to give you
a brief summary

784
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:24,651
of today's
historic happening.

785
00:41:24,735 --> 00:41:27,654
Pope Paul VI arrived
27A.M.

786
00:41:29,573 --> 00:41:30,991
What is it?

787
00:41:32,784 --> 00:41:33,994
Dizzy.

788
00:41:38,916 --> 00:41:40,000
Hey.

789
00:41:42,586 --> 00:41:43,670
No wonder.

790
00:41:43,754 --> 00:41:45,172
All that booze.

791
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:50,636
You didn't eat anything
all day before dinner, huh?

792
00:41:55,766 --> 00:41:57,184
Hey.

793
00:41:57,267 --> 00:41:58,977
Hey.

794
00:42:22,209 --> 00:42:23,293
Nice.

795
00:42:23,377 --> 00:42:24,962
Sleep is what you need.

796
00:42:25,045 --> 00:42:26,463
A good night's sleep.

797
00:42:27,339 --> 00:42:29,174
We have to make a baby.

798
00:42:29,258 --> 00:42:32,177
Oh, we'll...
we'll do it.

799
00:42:33,178 --> 00:42:35,889
Tomorrow.
There's plenty of time.

800
00:42:36,306 --> 00:42:37,724
Just a nap.

801
00:43:16,138 --> 00:43:18,557
Why are you
taking them off?

802
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,559
To make you
more comfortable.

803
00:43:20,642 --> 00:43:22,519
I am more comfortable.

804
00:43:22,603 --> 00:43:24,897
Sleep, Ro.

805
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:07,397
Isn't Hutch
coming with us?

806
00:44:07,481 --> 00:44:08,565
Catholics only,

807
00:44:08,649 --> 00:44:12,569
I wish we weren't bound by these
prejudices,

808
00:44:12,653 --> 00:44:15,322
but, unfortunately...

809
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:01,368
Easy, easy.

810
00:45:01,451 --> 00:45:03,287
You got her too high.

811
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:05,289
Typhoon!
Typhoon!

812
00:45:05,372 --> 00:45:08,292
It killed 55 people
in London

813
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:11,628
and it's heading this way!

814
00:45:17,342 --> 00:45:19,845
You better
go down below, Miss.

815
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,576
She's awake.
She sees.

816
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:25,369
She don't see.

817
00:46:25,452 --> 00:46:26,036
As long as
she ate the mouse,

818
00:46:26,078 --> 00:46:28,997
She can't hear.
She's like dead. Now sing.

819
00:46:39,633 --> 00:46:42,636
I'm sorry to hear
you aren't feeling well.

820
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:44,972
It's only the mouse bite.

821
00:46:45,055 --> 00:46:47,558
You'd better have
your legs tied down

822
00:46:47,641 --> 00:46:49,393
in case of convulsions.

823
00:46:50,561 --> 00:46:53,063
Yes, I suppose so.

824
00:46:53,647 --> 00:46:56,108
There's always a chance
it was rabid.

825
00:46:56,149 --> 00:46:57,401
If the music bothers you,

826
00:46:57,442 --> 00:47:00,404
Iet me know,
and I'll have it stopped.

827
00:47:00,445 --> 00:47:01,822
Oh, no, no, no.

828
00:47:01,905 --> 00:47:04,658
Please don't change
the program on my account.

829
00:47:05,409 --> 00:47:06,827
Try to sleep.

830
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:10,247
We'll be waiting up on deck.

831
00:47:47,576 --> 00:47:51,038
This is no dream!
This is really happening!

832
00:48:00,172 --> 00:48:02,633
They tell me you have
been bitten by a mouse.

833
00:48:02,716 --> 00:48:05,636
Yes. That's why I couldn't come
to see you.

834
00:48:05,677 --> 00:48:06,803
That's all right.

835
00:48:06,845 --> 00:48:10,766
We wouldn't want you
To jeopardize your health.

836
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:13,268
Am I forgiven, father?

837
00:48:13,352 --> 00:48:16,855
Oh, absolutely.

838
00:48:28,742 --> 00:48:31,036
00.

839
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,122
Uhm.

840
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:37,668
Five minutes.

841
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:40,671
I have to be at Alan's
00.

842
00:48:41,755 --> 00:48:42,840
Eat out.

843
00:48:42,923 --> 00:48:44,424
Like hell I will.

844
00:48:55,352 --> 00:48:57,312
What time is it?

845
00:48:57,354 --> 00:48:59,231
00.

846
00:49:00,357 --> 00:49:02,693
What time did I go to sleep?

847
00:49:02,776 --> 00:49:04,695
You didn't go to sleep.

848
00:49:04,778 --> 00:49:06,196
You passed out.

849
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,699
From now on you get
cocktails or wine,

850
00:49:08,782 --> 00:49:11,410
Not cocktails and wine, hmm?

851
00:49:11,493 --> 00:49:14,037
The dreams I had.

852
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:21,587
Don't yell.
I already filed them down.

853
00:49:22,671 --> 00:49:25,048
I didn't want to
miss baby night.

854
00:49:25,132 --> 00:49:27,801
A couple of my nails were ragged.
-While I was out?

855
00:49:27,843 --> 00:49:31,138
And it was kind of fun,
in a necrophile sort of way.

856
00:49:33,724 --> 00:49:37,895
I dreamed
someone was raping me.

857
00:49:37,978 --> 00:49:39,897
I don't know,
someone inhuman.

858
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,940
Thanks a lot!

859
00:49:44,484 --> 00:49:47,070
What's the matter?
-Nothing.

860
00:49:48,488 --> 00:49:50,741
I didn't want
to miss the night.

861
00:49:50,824 --> 00:49:53,744
We could've done it
this morning or tonight.

862
00:49:53,827 --> 00:49:56,246
Last night wasn't
the only split second.

863
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:59,750
I was a little bit loaded myself,
you know?

864
00:50:19,686 --> 00:50:21,146
Oh! Hello there.
Did ya like it?

865
00:50:21,188 --> 00:50:21,855
Oh, yeah.

866
00:50:21,939 --> 00:50:24,316
I think I put a little too much
cream de cocoa in it.

867
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:25,484
No, no.
It was delicious.

868
00:50:25,526 --> 00:50:26,777
You'll have to give me
the recipe.

869
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,820
Yeah, love to.
Oh, listen, you going shopping?

870
00:50:28,862 --> 00:50:30,405
Do me a teeny favor,
will ya?

871
00:50:30,489 --> 00:50:32,950
Get me six eggs, a small instant Sanka.
I'll pay you later.

872
00:50:32,991 --> 00:50:34,451
Right. Bye-bye.

873
00:50:44,711 --> 00:50:47,172
Don't you think we ought
to talk about it?

874
00:50:47,214 --> 00:50:48,298
About what?

875
00:50:48,966 --> 00:50:50,926
The way you haven't
been looking at me.

876
00:50:50,968 --> 00:50:53,136
What are you talking about?
I've been looking at you.

877
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,346
You haven't.

878
00:50:54,388 --> 00:50:55,848
Why, sure, I have.

879
00:50:55,889 --> 00:50:58,851
Now, what is it?
What's the matter?

880
00:51:01,103 --> 00:51:02,729
Nothing. Never mind.

881
00:51:02,771 --> 00:51:04,982
No, no. Don't say that.
What is it?

882
00:51:05,065 --> 00:51:06,149
Nothing.

883
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:08,151
Look, honey, l--

884
00:51:08,235 --> 00:51:10,487
I know I've been preoccupied
with the part and all,

885
00:51:10,571 --> 00:51:11,989
but it is important.

886
00:51:12,072 --> 00:51:14,491
That doesn't mean
I don't love you.

887
00:51:28,839 --> 00:51:31,175
It was due on Friday.

888
00:51:32,676 --> 00:51:33,760
It was?

889
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:37,389
It'll probably come
tonight or tomorrow.

890
00:51:37,472 --> 00:51:38,724
- Wanna bet?
- Yeah.

891
00:51:38,807 --> 00:51:40,100
- A quarter.
- O.K.

892
00:51:40,184 --> 00:51:41,351
You're going to lose.

893
00:51:41,435 --> 00:51:42,603
Shut up, will you?

894
00:51:42,686 --> 00:51:43,604
You're getting me
all jumpy.

895
00:51:44,229 --> 00:51:45,814
It's only been two days.

896
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,774
When will I know?

897
00:51:47,858 --> 00:51:50,277
I'll call you just as soon as I
get the results.

898
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,446
I like to do
a general examination

899
00:51:52,529 --> 00:51:54,448
just to know
something more...

900
00:51:56,116 --> 00:51:59,036
It was Elise Dunstan who recommended
you to me, Doctor.

901
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:00,120
Oh, yes.
How is she?

902
00:52:00,162 --> 00:52:03,040
She's fine. And the boys are great.
Did you deliver all of them?

903
00:52:03,749 --> 00:52:05,167
No, just the last.

904
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:07,002
Universal hemoglobin.

905
00:52:07,085 --> 00:52:09,171
Yes, Doctor.

906
00:52:21,558 --> 00:52:23,018
We went to see
The Fantasticks.

907
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:25,145
-Did you?
-Mmm.

908
00:52:25,187 --> 00:52:26,855
Did you enjoy it?
-Yeah.

909
00:52:26,897 --> 00:52:27,981
Good.

910
00:52:34,112 --> 00:52:35,197
Hello?

911
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,198
Mrs. Woodhouse?

912
00:52:36,281 --> 00:52:37,157
Dr. Hill?

913
00:52:37,241 --> 00:52:38,325
Congratulations.

914
00:52:38,408 --> 00:52:40,661
-Really?
-Really.

915
00:52:43,372 --> 00:52:44,414
Are you there?

916
00:52:44,498 --> 00:52:46,917
Uh, yes, um,
what happens now?

917
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,419
You come see me
next month.

918
00:52:49,503 --> 00:52:51,421
You get those Natalin pills.
One a day.

919
00:52:51,505 --> 00:52:53,924
I'll mail you forms
for the hospital.

920
00:52:54,007 --> 00:52:55,926
Uh, when will it be?

921
00:52:56,009 --> 00:52:57,928
It works out
to be June 28th.

922
00:52:58,804 --> 00:53:01,390
-That sounds so far away!
-It is.

923
00:53:01,473 --> 00:53:02,850
One more thing,
Mrs. Woodhouse,

924
00:53:02,891 --> 00:53:04,852
we'd like another
blood sample.

925
00:53:04,893 --> 00:53:06,353
Oh, yes, of course.

926
00:53:06,395 --> 00:53:07,479
What for?

927
00:53:07,563 --> 00:53:09,481
The nurse didn't take enough,

928
00:53:09,565 --> 00:53:11,567
so would you
drop by and see her?

929
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:13,527
But I am pregnant,
aren't I?

930
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:17,531
Oh, yes, it's just for blood samp--
Blood sugar and so forth.

931
00:53:17,614 --> 00:53:19,199
But you're pregnant.
Don't worry.

932
00:53:19,241 --> 00:53:21,785
All right.
Well, I'll come in on Monday.

933
00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:23,370
All right.
Don't forget the pills.

934
00:53:23,412 --> 00:53:24,413
No, I won't.

935
00:53:24,496 --> 00:53:26,748
-Goodbye, Mrs. Woodhouse.
-Goodbye, Dr. Hill.

936
00:53:29,042 --> 00:53:30,460
Blood sugar?

937
00:53:46,476 --> 00:53:47,728
What's that?

938
00:53:50,898 --> 00:53:52,107
Oh!

939
00:53:52,191 --> 00:53:53,233
That's great.

940
00:53:53,317 --> 00:53:54,860
That's just great.

941
00:53:54,943 --> 00:53:55,861
Father.

942
00:53:55,944 --> 00:53:56,987
Mother.

943
00:53:59,198 --> 00:54:01,241
Guy, Guy, listen.

944
00:54:01,325 --> 00:54:04,328
Let's, uh, make this
a new beginning, O.K.?

945
00:54:04,411 --> 00:54:06,663
A new openness in
talking to each other,

946
00:54:06,747 --> 00:54:08,832
because we haven't been open.

947
00:54:08,874 --> 00:54:12,127
That's true.
I've been so goddamned self-centered.

948
00:54:12,169 --> 00:54:13,712
That's what
the whole trouble is.

949
00:54:13,795 --> 00:54:15,964
You know I love you,
don't you, Ro?

950
00:54:16,048 --> 00:54:17,299
I do. I swear to God

951
00:54:17,382 --> 00:54:18,675
I'm going to be
as open and--

952
00:54:18,759 --> 00:54:20,052
It's my fault
as much as yours.

953
00:54:20,135 --> 00:54:21,887
No, bull, it's mine.
Now you bear with me.

954
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:23,722
I'll try and do better,
you hear?

955
00:54:23,805 --> 00:54:25,474
Oh, Guy.

956
00:54:34,733 --> 00:54:35,817
What?

957
00:54:35,859 --> 00:54:37,152
It's...

958
00:54:37,194 --> 00:54:40,364
a fine way for parents
to be carrying on.

959
00:54:40,447 --> 00:54:42,407
Hey...

960
00:54:42,491 --> 00:54:43,992
know what I'd love to do?

961
00:54:44,076 --> 00:54:44,993
What?

962
00:54:45,077 --> 00:54:46,620
Tell Minnie and Roman.

963
00:54:46,703 --> 00:54:48,997
Oh, I know, I know.

964
00:54:49,081 --> 00:54:50,332
It's, uh...

965
00:54:50,374 --> 00:54:53,502
it's, uh, supposed to be
a deep, dark secret,

966
00:54:53,585 --> 00:54:56,255
but I already told them
that we were trying.

967
00:54:56,338 --> 00:54:58,841
They were so pleased.

968
00:54:58,924 --> 00:55:00,717
Tell them.

969
00:55:01,426 --> 00:55:02,761
Back in two minutes?

970
00:55:14,314 --> 00:55:16,149
You're pregnant.

971
00:55:18,902 --> 00:55:20,362
Another blood sample.

972
00:55:20,487 --> 00:55:21,446
Ta-da!

973
00:55:21,488 --> 00:55:24,700
Now, that's what
I call good news.

974
00:55:24,783 --> 00:55:27,786
Aw, honey,
congratulations.

975
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:28,787
Thank you.

976
00:55:28,871 --> 00:55:31,582
-Best wishes, Rosemary.
-Thank you very much.

977
00:55:31,665 --> 00:55:33,333
We are more pleased
than we can say.

978
00:55:33,417 --> 00:55:34,877
We didn't have any
champagne on hand,

979
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,712
but this will do
just as nicely.

980
00:55:36,753 --> 00:55:37,754
When are you due, dear?

981
00:55:37,796 --> 00:55:39,173
June 28th.

982
00:55:39,256 --> 00:55:40,716
Oh, it's going
to be so exciting.

983
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,342
Listen, dear,
you got a good doctor?

984
00:55:42,426 --> 00:55:43,719
Oh, yes,
a very good one.

985
00:55:43,802 --> 00:55:45,262
One of the top
obstetricians

986
00:55:45,345 --> 00:55:47,514
is a dear friend of ours,
Abe Sapirstein.

987
00:55:47,598 --> 00:55:49,725
Delivers all
the society babies.

988
00:55:49,808 --> 00:55:50,934
Abe Sapirstein?

989
00:55:51,018 --> 00:55:53,020
One of the finest obstetricians
in the country.

990
00:55:53,103 --> 00:55:55,063
Wasn't he on Open End
a couple of years ago?

991
00:55:55,105 --> 00:55:56,064
That's right.

992
00:55:57,107 --> 00:55:58,317
Ro?

993
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,861
Uh...
well, what about Dr. Hill?

994
00:56:00,944 --> 00:56:02,529
Don't worry about Hill.
I'll tell him something.

995
00:56:02,613 --> 00:56:03,822
You know me.

996
00:56:03,906 --> 00:56:06,033
Listen, I won't let you
go to no Dr. Hill

997
00:56:06,116 --> 00:56:07,534
nobody ever heard of.

998
00:56:07,618 --> 00:56:09,578
The best is what you're going to have,
young lady.

999
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:11,079
Where's your telephone, huh?

1000
00:56:11,121 --> 00:56:12,539
It's in the bedroom.

1001
00:56:12,623 --> 00:56:13,832
He's a brilliant man.

1002
00:56:13,916 --> 00:56:15,042
Very sensitive.

1003
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:17,085
Ro, sit down, sit down.

1004
00:56:17,127 --> 00:56:18,545
No, I'm fine.

1005
00:56:18,629 --> 00:56:20,964
Abe, Minnie. Fine.

1006
00:56:21,048 --> 00:56:22,466
Listen, Abe,
a dear friend of ours

1007
00:56:22,549 --> 00:56:24,801
just found out today
she's pregnant.

1008
00:56:24,885 --> 00:56:27,721
Yeah, isn't it?
I'm in her apartment right now.

1009
00:56:27,804 --> 00:56:29,932
We told her you'd be glad
to take care of her.

1010
00:56:30,015 --> 00:56:33,185
You wouldn't charge her none of
your fancy society prices neither.

1011
00:56:33,227 --> 00:56:34,728
Well, just wait a minute.

1012
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:37,147
00?

1013
00:56:37,189 --> 00:56:38,106
All right.

1014
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:39,691
00's fine, Abe.

1015
00:56:39,775 --> 00:56:42,861
Uh-huh.
Yeah, well, you, too.

1016
00:56:42,945 --> 00:56:44,947
No, no, no, no,
not at all.

1017
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:46,240
All right.
Well, let's hope so.

1018
00:56:46,323 --> 00:56:47,991
Goodbye.

1019
00:56:48,075 --> 00:56:49,910
Well, there you are.

1020
00:56:49,993 --> 00:56:51,453
Thanks a million, Minnie.

1021
00:56:51,537 --> 00:56:53,247
I don't know how to thank you.
Both of you.

1022
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:55,707
Just have a fine,
healthy baby, that's all.

1023
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:59,837
My, I can't wait to tell
Laura-Louise.

1024
00:56:59,878 --> 00:57:01,088
Oh...

1025
00:57:01,171 --> 00:57:04,466
uh, please don't tell anyone else,
not right away.

1026
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:07,010
No, she's right.
There's plenty of time.

1027
00:57:07,135 --> 00:57:09,930
Now, to a fine, healthy baby.

1028
00:57:09,972 --> 00:57:12,015
-Hear, hear.
-Hear!

1029
00:57:13,642 --> 00:57:14,893
Andy.

1030
00:57:17,521 --> 00:57:19,314
or Susan.

1031
00:57:20,482 --> 00:57:22,317
Susan.

1032
00:58:07,654 --> 00:58:09,865
Please don't read books.

1033
00:58:09,948 --> 00:58:13,785
No pregnancy was ever exactly
like the ones described in the books.

1034
00:58:14,494 --> 00:58:17,289
And don't listen
to your friends, either.

1035
00:58:17,372 --> 00:58:20,542
No two pregnancies
are ever alike.

1036
00:58:20,626 --> 00:58:24,129
Dr. Hill prescribed vitamin pills.
-No pills.

1037
00:58:24,171 --> 00:58:27,090
Minnie Castavet
has a herbarium.

1038
00:58:27,174 --> 00:58:29,218
I'm going to have her
make a daily drink for you

1039
00:58:29,301 --> 00:58:31,553
that'll be fresher, safer,
and more vitamin-rich

1040
00:58:31,637 --> 00:58:33,972
than any pills
on the market.

1041
00:58:35,182 --> 00:58:37,726
Any questions you have,
call me night or day.

1042
00:58:37,809 --> 00:58:40,687
Call me, not your Aunt Fanny.
That's what I'm here for.

1043
00:58:40,771 --> 00:58:43,315
-Here.
-What's in it?

1044
00:58:43,398 --> 00:58:46,235
Snips and snails
and puppy dogs' tails.

1045
00:58:46,318 --> 00:58:48,195
That's fine,
but what if we want a girl?

1046
00:58:48,278 --> 00:58:49,488
Do you?

1047
00:58:50,405 --> 00:58:52,366
It would be nice if the first one
were a boy.

1048
00:58:52,449 --> 00:58:56,036
Well, there you are.

1049
00:58:57,287 --> 00:58:59,373
No, really, what is in it?

1050
00:58:58,956 --> 00:59:01,083
A raw egg, gelatin, herbs.

1051
00:59:01,166 --> 00:59:02,668
Tannis root?

1052
00:59:02,751 --> 00:59:05,546
Some of that along
with some other things.

1053
00:59:06,046 --> 00:59:09,007
Don't be so violent, Harry.
If you want to be stupid,

1054
00:59:09,091 --> 00:59:10,592
be nonviolent stupid,

1055
00:59:10,676 --> 00:59:13,136
I'm in love with no one.

1056
00:59:13,178 --> 00:59:15,097
Especially not
your fat wife.

1057
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:17,432
I'm a hopeless cripple...

1058
00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:21,228
What's that?

1059
00:59:22,437 --> 00:59:24,857
I-I've been
to Vidal Sassoon.

1060
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:28,360
Don't tell me
you paid for that.

1061
00:59:28,443 --> 00:59:29,945
Guy,

1062
00:59:30,028 --> 00:59:31,530
I have a pain.

1063
00:59:31,613 --> 00:59:32,573
Where?

1064
00:59:32,656 --> 00:59:33,866
Here.

1065
00:59:33,949 --> 00:59:35,325
Just now?

1066
00:59:35,367 --> 00:59:36,660
Since Monday.

1067
00:59:37,327 --> 00:59:38,537
A sharp pain.

1068
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:39,913
Did you see Sapirstein?

1069
00:59:39,997 --> 00:59:41,373
I'm seeing him
on Wednesday.

1070
00:59:41,498 --> 00:59:42,541
This is ridiculous.

1071
00:59:42,666 --> 00:59:43,959
Why don't you see Sapirstein?

1072
00:59:44,042 --> 00:59:45,419
Why didn't you say anything?

1073
00:59:45,502 --> 00:59:47,671
I see him Wednesday
regular.

1074
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:50,424
An entirely natural
expansion of the pelvis.

1075
00:59:50,507 --> 00:59:52,134
You can fight it
with ordinary aspirin.

1076
00:59:52,217 --> 00:59:54,803
I was afraid it might be
an ectopic pregnancy.

1077
00:59:54,887 --> 00:59:56,096
Ectopic?

1078
00:59:56,722 --> 00:59:58,599
I thought you weren't
going to read books, Rosemary.

1079
00:59:58,682 --> 01:00:01,935
-It was staring at me in the drugstore.
-All it did was worry you.

1080
01:00:02,019 --> 01:00:04,229
Will you go home
and throw it away, please?

1081
01:00:04,313 --> 01:00:06,481
The pains will
be gone in two days.

1082
01:00:07,774 --> 01:00:09,568
Ectopic pregnancy!

1083
01:00:53,278 --> 01:00:55,155
I look awful.

1084
01:00:56,073 --> 01:00:59,451
What are you talking about?
You look great!

1085
01:00:59,452 --> 01:01:02,079
It's that haircut
that looks awful.

1086
01:01:02,162 --> 01:01:03,205
You want the truth, honey,

1087
01:01:03,247 --> 01:01:06,208
that's the worst mistake
you ever made.

1088
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:41,326
My God!

1089
01:01:42,452 --> 01:01:45,080
It's Vidal Sassoon.
It's very in.

1090
01:01:45,163 --> 01:01:46,790
What's wrong with you?

1091
01:01:46,874 --> 01:01:48,333
Do I look that bad?

1092
01:01:48,417 --> 01:01:49,459
Terrible!

1093
01:01:49,543 --> 01:01:51,712
You're not on one
Of those Zen diets, are you?

1094
01:01:51,795 --> 01:01:52,713
No.

1095
01:01:52,796 --> 01:01:53,881
Then what is it?

1096
01:01:53,964 --> 01:01:55,132
Have you seen a doctor?

1097
01:01:56,008 --> 01:01:59,887
Hutch, I might
as well tell you.

1098
01:01:59,888 --> 01:01:59,888
I'm pregnant.

1099
01:01:59,889 --> 01:01:59,889
Oh, rubbish.

1100
01:01:59,678 --> 01:02:03,390
Pregnant women gain weight.
They don't lose it.

1101
01:02:03,473 --> 01:02:05,058
I don't sleep well.

1102
01:02:05,142 --> 01:02:08,020
I have stiff joints or something,
so I get a pain.

1103
01:02:08,103 --> 01:02:09,062
Nothing serious.

1104
01:02:09,771 --> 01:02:11,815
Well, congratulations.

1105
01:02:11,899 --> 01:02:13,609
You must be very happy.

1106
01:02:13,692 --> 01:02:15,903
Oh, I am.
We both are.

1107
01:02:15,944 --> 01:02:17,779
Who's your obstetrician?

1108
01:02:17,863 --> 01:02:19,573
Abraham Sapirstein.

1109
01:02:19,656 --> 01:02:22,951
Oh! He delivered two
of my daughter's babies.

1110
01:02:23,035 --> 01:02:24,786
He's one of the best
in the city.

1111
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:26,079
When did you
see him last?

1112
01:02:26,163 --> 01:02:27,581
Um, yesterday.

1113
01:02:27,623 --> 01:02:28,540
And?

1114
01:02:28,624 --> 01:02:30,834
And he says
it's fairly common.

1115
01:02:32,085 --> 01:02:34,171
How much weight
have you lost?

1116
01:02:35,506 --> 01:02:37,508
Uh, 3 pounds.

1117
01:02:37,591 --> 01:02:39,551
Nonsense. You've lost
far more than that.

1118
01:02:40,177 --> 01:02:42,429
It's perfectly normal
to lose a little at first.

1119
01:02:42,513 --> 01:02:44,056
Later on, I'll be gaining.

1120
01:02:44,139 --> 01:02:45,557
Well...

1121
01:02:46,433 --> 01:02:49,520
we must assume Dr. Sapirstein
knows where of he speaks.

1122
01:02:49,603 --> 01:02:51,563
He should.
He charges enough.

1123
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:53,065
We're getting
bargain rates.

1124
01:02:53,148 --> 01:02:55,067
Our neighbors are
close friends of his.

1125
01:02:55,943 --> 01:02:56,902
I'll go.

1126
01:02:56,944 --> 01:02:57,861
Stay where you are.

1127
01:02:57,945 --> 01:03:00,239
It hurts less
when I move around.

1128
01:03:02,741 --> 01:03:04,993
Oh, I was just
talking about you.

1129
01:03:05,077 --> 01:03:06,245
Favorably, I hope.

1130
01:03:06,286 --> 01:03:07,746
Do you need anything
from outside?

1131
01:03:07,829 --> 01:03:09,373
No. Thank you for asking.

1132
01:03:09,456 --> 01:03:10,874
Is Guy home already?

1133
01:03:10,958 --> 01:03:12,668
00.

1134
01:03:12,751 --> 01:03:13,669
Oh.

1135
01:03:13,752 --> 01:03:16,421
A friend of ours is here.

1136
01:03:16,505 --> 01:03:18,674
Would you--
would you like to meet him?

1137
01:03:18,757 --> 01:03:20,551
If I won't
be intruding.

1138
01:03:20,592 --> 01:03:22,052
No. Please come in.

1139
01:03:33,188 --> 01:03:36,191
Hutch, this is Roman Castavet.

1140
01:03:36,483 --> 01:03:37,442
Edward Hutchins.

1141
01:03:37,484 --> 01:03:38,485
How do you do?

1142
01:03:38,527 --> 01:03:39,611
Oh, how are you, sir?

1143
01:03:39,653 --> 01:03:41,530
I was just telling Hutch
that it was you and Minnie

1144
01:03:41,572 --> 01:03:42,948
who sent me
to Dr. Sapirstein.

1145
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:45,033
Oh, so Rosemary has told you
the good news.

1146
01:03:45,117 --> 01:03:46,118
Yes, she has.

1147
01:03:46,201 --> 01:03:47,995
We must see that
she gets plenty of rest.

1148
01:03:48,036 --> 01:03:50,205
I was a bit alarmed
by her appearance.

1149
01:03:50,289 --> 01:03:51,915
Well, she has lost
some weight,

1150
01:03:51,957 --> 01:03:53,917
but that's quite normal
for the early months.

1151
01:03:53,959 --> 01:03:56,837
Later on, she'll gain,
probably far too much.

1152
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:57,838
So I gather.

1153
01:03:57,921 --> 01:03:59,381
Please sit down.

1154
01:03:59,464 --> 01:04:02,301
Mrs. Castavet makes
a vitamin drink for me every day

1155
01:04:02,384 --> 01:04:03,844
from fresh herbs
she grows.

1156
01:04:03,927 --> 01:04:06,722
Yes, all according to Dr. Sapirstein's
directions, of course.

1157
01:04:06,763 --> 01:04:08,765
He's inclined
to be suspicious

1158
01:04:08,849 --> 01:04:11,351
of commercially prepared
vitamin pills.

1159
01:04:11,435 --> 01:04:13,812
Indeed?
But surely they're manufactured

1160
01:04:13,896 --> 01:04:15,355
under every imaginable
safeguard.

1161
01:04:15,439 --> 01:04:17,691
That's quite true,
but commercial pills

1162
01:04:17,733 --> 01:04:19,776
can sit for months
on a druggist's shelf

1163
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:22,571
and lose a great deal
of their original potency.

1164
01:04:22,613 --> 01:04:23,739
I hadn't thought of that.

1165
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:26,241
I like the idea of having everything
fresh and natural.

1166
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:30,245
I'll bet expectant mothers
chewed bits of tannis root

1167
01:04:30,329 --> 01:04:32,331
when nobody'd even heard
of vitamin pills.

1168
01:04:32,372 --> 01:04:33,415
Tannis root?

1169
01:04:33,498 --> 01:04:35,459
It's one of the herbs
she puts in the drink.

1170
01:04:35,501 --> 01:04:37,794
Or is it an herb?
Can a root be an herb?

1171
01:04:37,836 --> 01:04:40,464
You sure you don't mean anise
or orris root?

1172
01:04:40,547 --> 01:04:41,465
No, tannis.

1173
01:04:44,218 --> 01:04:45,260
Look.

1174
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:49,681
It's good luck, too.

1175
01:04:49,765 --> 01:04:51,808
Ish!

1176
01:04:53,810 --> 01:04:56,313
Doesn't look like,
uh, root matter,

1177
01:04:56,396 --> 01:04:58,982
more like mold or fungus
of some kind.

1178
01:05:00,776 --> 01:05:02,152
Is it ever called
by any other name?

1179
01:05:02,236 --> 01:05:04,154
Not to my knowledge, no.

1180
01:05:05,572 --> 01:05:08,784
Tannis. I must look it up
in the encyclopedia.

1181
01:05:08,867 --> 01:05:11,662
What a pretty holder
or charm or whatever it is.

1182
01:05:11,745 --> 01:05:13,163
The Castavets gave it to me.

1183
01:05:13,914 --> 01:05:14,706
You and your wife

1184
01:05:14,748 --> 01:05:16,500
seem to be taking better care
of Rosemary

1185
01:05:16,583 --> 01:05:17,584
than her own parents.

1186
01:05:17,668 --> 01:05:20,170
We're very fond of her.
And of Guy, too.

1187
01:05:20,254 --> 01:05:22,297
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'll have to go.

1188
01:05:22,381 --> 01:05:24,091
My wife is waiting for me.

1189
01:05:24,174 --> 01:05:25,509
It's a pleasure
to have met you.

1190
01:05:25,592 --> 01:05:26,927
Oh, don't bother, Rosemary.

1191
01:05:27,052 --> 01:05:29,555
We'll meet again, I'm sure.

1192
01:05:32,266 --> 01:05:34,351
I just noticed
he has pierced ears.

1193
01:05:35,185 --> 01:05:38,063
Pierced ears
and piercing eyes.

1194
01:05:38,146 --> 01:05:39,815
What's she like?

1195
01:05:40,816 --> 01:05:43,151
Nosy.
Funny.

1196
01:05:43,193 --> 01:05:44,945
Guy's gotten
very close to them.

1197
01:05:44,987 --> 01:05:46,446
I suppose they've become

1198
01:05:46,488 --> 01:05:48,866
sort of parent figures for him.

1199
01:05:50,617 --> 01:05:51,827
And you?

1200
01:05:52,703 --> 01:05:54,454
I--I don't know.

1201
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:57,374
Sometimes I think they're too friendly
and helpful.

1202
01:05:59,042 --> 01:06:00,586
Hey, what a surprise.

1203
01:06:00,627 --> 01:06:01,670
How are you, Hutch?
Good to see you.

1204
01:06:01,712 --> 01:06:03,005
You're the surprise.
What happened?

1205
01:06:03,046 --> 01:06:05,674
They stopped for a rewrite,
those dumb bastards.

1206
01:06:06,466 --> 01:06:08,552
Ah, stay where you are.
Nobody move.

1207
01:06:08,635 --> 01:06:10,220
Would you like some coffee?

1208
01:06:10,304 --> 01:06:11,305
Love some!

1209
01:06:16,894 --> 01:06:17,936
Loot!

1210
01:06:18,562 --> 01:06:20,647
Seems congratulations
are in order.

1211
01:06:20,689 --> 01:06:21,899
Yeah, it's wonderful,
isn't it?

1212
01:06:21,982 --> 01:06:23,066
When's the baby due?

1213
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:24,401
June 28th.

1214
01:06:24,651 --> 01:06:26,236
Did you know
that Dr. Sapirstein

1215
01:06:26,278 --> 01:06:28,488
delivered two of
Hutch's grandchildren?

1216
01:06:28,572 --> 01:06:29,823
-Really?
-Mmm.

1217
01:06:29,907 --> 01:06:31,366
I met your neighbor.

1218
01:06:31,408 --> 01:06:32,367
Roman Castavet.

1219
01:06:32,409 --> 01:06:33,869
Oh, did you?

1220
01:06:33,911 --> 01:06:35,287
Funny old duck,
isn't he?

1221
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:37,372
Did you ever notice
he has pierced ears?

1222
01:06:37,414 --> 01:06:39,750
-You're kidding.
-No, I'm not. I saw.

1223
01:06:39,791 --> 01:06:41,752
It's a shame we haven't
seen more of you lately,

1224
01:06:41,793 --> 01:06:45,005
but with me being so busy
and Ro being the way she is,

1225
01:06:45,088 --> 01:06:46,256
we really haven't
seen anyone.

1226
01:06:46,298 --> 01:06:48,091
Perhaps we can have dinner
together soon.

1227
01:06:48,133 --> 01:06:49,092
You're not going,
are you?

1228
01:06:49,134 --> 01:06:50,427
Thanks for the coffee, my dear.

1229
01:06:50,469 --> 01:06:52,471
Thank you for coming,
my dear.

1230
01:06:57,267 --> 01:06:59,603
This isn't mine.
It must be yours, right?

1231
01:06:59,686 --> 01:07:00,687
Right you are.

1232
01:07:00,771 --> 01:07:03,148
Have you thought about names,
or is it too soon?

1233
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:04,983
Andrew or Douglas
if it's a boy,

1234
01:07:05,025 --> 01:07:06,485
Melinda or Sarah
if it's a girl.

1235
01:07:06,527 --> 01:07:07,819
Sarah? What happened to Susan?

1236
01:07:07,861 --> 01:07:09,947
Say, is there another
of these around?

1237
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:11,490
Oh.

1238
01:07:16,537 --> 01:07:17,538
I don't see it, Hutch.

1239
01:07:17,579 --> 01:07:19,414
No, it's not here.

1240
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:21,708
I probably left it
at the City Center.

1241
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:23,168
I'll stop back there.

1242
01:07:23,252 --> 01:07:24,920
Let's really have that dinner,
shall we?

1243
01:07:24,962 --> 01:07:25,921
Definitely.

1244
01:07:25,963 --> 01:07:26,922
Next week.

1245
01:07:26,964 --> 01:07:27,923
Bye.

1246
01:07:27,965 --> 01:07:28,924
Goodbye.

1247
01:07:28,966 --> 01:07:29,925
- Bye.
- Bye.

1248
01:07:37,724 --> 01:07:39,726
It was a nice surprise.

1249
01:07:39,810 --> 01:07:42,062
Guess what he said.

1250
01:07:42,813 --> 01:07:43,730
What?

1251
01:07:43,814 --> 01:07:45,232
I look terrible.

1252
01:07:46,149 --> 01:07:46,984
Good old Hutch.

1253
01:07:47,025 --> 01:07:49,111
He's spreading cheer
wherever he goes.

1254
01:07:49,194 --> 01:07:51,363
I'm going to get a paper,
honey.

1255
01:07:52,406 --> 01:07:54,198
He's a professional crepehanger.

1256
01:07:54,199 --> 01:07:55,909
He's not a professional
crepehanger.

1257
01:07:55,951 --> 01:07:57,953
Then he's one of the top-ranking
amateurs.

1258
01:08:10,174 --> 01:08:11,091
Hello.

1259
01:08:11,175 --> 01:08:13,886
Oh, uh, she's not
feeling too well.

1260
01:08:14,845 --> 01:08:16,930
Well, I think she's asleep.

1261
01:08:17,014 --> 01:08:18,265
All right.

1262
01:08:19,308 --> 01:08:22,227
Oh, she could be, yeah.

1263
01:08:22,311 --> 01:08:24,771
All right,
can you hold on a minute?

1264
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:29,693
It's Hutch.
He wants to speak to you.

1265
01:08:29,735 --> 01:08:30,777
Oh.

1266
01:08:31,445 --> 01:08:35,532
I told him you were resting,
but he said he couldn't wait.

1267
01:08:42,247 --> 01:08:43,081
Hutch?

1268
01:08:43,123 --> 01:08:45,542
Tell me, dear,
do you go out at all?

1269
01:08:45,626 --> 01:08:49,171
Well, I--I haven't been going out,
why?

1270
01:08:49,254 --> 01:08:51,256
Can you meet me
00

1271
01:08:51,298 --> 01:08:53,467
in front of
the Time-Life building?

1272
01:08:53,550 --> 01:08:55,093
Yes, if you want me to.

1273
01:08:55,469 --> 01:08:57,387
What is it?
Can't you tell me now?

1274
01:08:57,429 --> 01:08:58,639
I'd rather not.

1275
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:00,933
We can have an early lunch
if you like.

1276
01:09:01,016 --> 01:09:02,059
That would be nice.

1277
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:03,060
00 then?

1278
01:09:03,143 --> 01:09:04,061
O.K.

1279
01:09:04,144 --> 01:09:05,562
Oh, did you find your glove?

1280
01:09:05,646 --> 01:09:06,897
No, they didn't have it.

1281
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:08,482
Good night, Rosemary.
Sleep well.

1282
01:09:08,524 --> 01:09:10,400
You, too.
Good night.

1283
01:09:11,026 --> 01:09:12,402
What was that?

1284
01:09:12,444 --> 01:09:13,987
He wants to talk to me.

1285
01:09:14,029 --> 01:09:14,988
What about?

1286
01:09:15,030 --> 01:09:16,740
I don't know.
He wouldn't say.

1287
01:09:17,491 --> 01:09:19,201
I think those
boys' adventure stories

1288
01:09:19,243 --> 01:09:20,744
are going to his head.

1289
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:24,706
Where are you meeting him?

1290
01:09:24,790 --> 01:09:28,794
Uh, Time and Life building
00.

1291
01:09:31,463 --> 01:09:32,756
This is ridiculous.

1292
01:09:33,549 --> 01:09:35,133
You're pregnant,
I've got the yens.

1293
01:09:35,175 --> 01:09:36,593
I'm getting an ice-cream cone.
You want one?

1294
01:09:36,677 --> 01:09:38,178
Yeah, I'd love one.

1295
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:39,304
Vanilla?

1296
01:09:39,388 --> 01:09:40,305
O.K.

1297
01:09:40,389 --> 01:09:41,348
O.K.

1298
01:10:03,745 --> 01:10:04,663
Hi.

1299
01:10:04,746 --> 01:10:05,914
Minnie, I'm going out now,

1300
01:10:05,998 --> 01:10:07,666
so I won't have
00.

1301
01:10:07,749 --> 01:10:09,251
That's fine, dear.
Take it later.

1302
01:10:09,293 --> 01:10:11,253
Buzz me when you get back,
huh?

1303
01:10:38,822 --> 01:10:42,159
Pain, be gone.
I will have no more of thee.

1304
01:11:17,444 --> 01:11:18,570
Yes?

1305
01:11:18,654 --> 01:11:20,531
Is this Edward Hutchins'
apartment?

1306
01:11:20,614 --> 01:11:21,865
Yes. Who is this, please?

1307
01:11:21,949 --> 01:11:23,951
My name is
Rosemary Woodhouse.

1308
01:11:23,992 --> 01:11:25,661
I had an appointment
with Mr. Hutchins.

1309
01:11:25,744 --> 01:11:28,121
Is he there?

1310
01:11:28,163 --> 01:11:29,122
Hello?

1311
01:11:29,164 --> 01:11:32,251
He was taken ill
this morning.

1312
01:11:32,334 --> 01:11:34,461
-Taken ill?
-Yes.

1313
01:11:34,503 --> 01:11:37,130
He's in a deep coma at St. Vincent's
hospital.

1314
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,216
That's awful.

1315
01:11:39,299 --> 01:11:43,387
I--I--I just spoke to him
30.

1316
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:45,097
I spoke to him
00.

1317
01:11:45,138 --> 01:11:46,598
Who is this?

1318
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,058
You don't know me,
Rosemary.

1319
01:11:48,141 --> 01:11:49,893
I'm Grace Cardiff,
Hutch's friend.

1320
01:11:49,977 --> 01:11:52,813
Um, do they know
what's causing it?

1321
01:11:52,855 --> 01:11:54,565
No, they don't know yet.

1322
01:11:54,648 --> 01:11:56,775
At the moment, he's
totally unresponsive.

1323
01:11:58,026 --> 01:12:00,112
Oh, I'm going
to the hospital now.

1324
01:12:00,153 --> 01:12:01,572
Is there anything
I can do?

1325
01:12:01,655 --> 01:12:02,698
Not really.

1326
01:12:04,116 --> 01:12:06,159
All right, um,
thank you.

1327
01:12:34,730 --> 01:12:35,981
No!

1328
01:12:36,023 --> 01:12:38,734
This is what I call
the long arm of coincidence!

1329
01:12:41,195 --> 01:12:44,156
I said to myself,
as long as Rosemary's going out,

1330
01:12:44,198 --> 01:12:47,201
I might as well go out and do
a little bit of Christmas shopping.

1331
01:12:47,242 --> 01:12:50,662
Now here you are, here I am.
Isn't that something?

1332
01:12:50,746 --> 01:12:53,040
Aw, darling,
what's the matter?

1333
01:12:53,081 --> 01:12:55,459
You feel all right?

1334
01:12:55,542 --> 01:12:58,712
Aw...
aw, you poor thing.

1335
01:12:58,754 --> 01:13:00,255
You know
what I think?

1336
01:13:00,297 --> 01:13:02,132
I think we better
be going home now.

1337
01:13:02,216 --> 01:13:03,217
What do you say?

1338
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:05,135
No, no, you have
your shopping to do.

1339
01:13:05,177 --> 01:13:07,471
Ah, shoot,
there's two more weeks.

1340
01:13:24,821 --> 01:13:26,823
It'll stop any day now.

1341
01:13:26,865 --> 01:13:30,244
It's like a wire inside me
getting tighter and tighter.

1342
01:13:30,327 --> 01:13:33,330
Usually older women
with less flexible joints

1343
01:13:33,413 --> 01:13:35,332
have this sort of trouble.

1344
01:13:35,415 --> 01:13:36,792
I'm not going out anymore.

1345
01:13:36,834 --> 01:13:37,876
You don't have to.

1346
01:13:37,918 --> 01:13:40,128
One minute to go!

1347
01:13:41,255 --> 01:13:43,841
Rosemary,
I want you to meet Dr. Shand.

1348
01:13:43,924 --> 01:13:46,134
He used to be
a famous dentist.

1349
01:13:46,218 --> 01:13:48,095
He made the chain
For your charm.

1350
01:13:48,178 --> 01:13:49,596
Oh, how do you do?

1351
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,098
Come on, sweetie.

1352
01:13:51,181 --> 01:13:52,808
Put this wonderful hat on.

1353
01:13:52,891 --> 01:13:55,018
Doctor, come over here.

1354
01:13:55,102 --> 01:13:56,019
Minnie, Minnie.

1355
01:13:56,103 --> 01:13:57,521
Happy New Year.

1356
01:13:57,604 --> 01:13:59,648
Have a good year.

1357
01:13:59,731 --> 01:14:01,149
Happy New Year.

1358
01:14:03,777 --> 01:14:06,280
To 1966!

1359
01:14:06,363 --> 01:14:08,407
The Year 1!

1360
01:15:00,792 --> 01:15:02,711
What the hell are you doing?

1361
01:15:02,753 --> 01:15:04,796
Planning the menu.

1362
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:08,759
We're having a party
a week from Saturday.

1363
01:15:08,842 --> 01:15:10,385
It's for our old--

1364
01:15:10,469 --> 01:15:12,346
I mean, our young friends.

1365
01:15:12,387 --> 01:15:14,515
Minnie and Roman
are not invited.

1366
01:15:14,598 --> 01:15:16,558
Neither is Laura-Louise.

1367
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:18,268
Nor is Dr. Sapirstein.

1368
01:15:18,352 --> 01:15:19,853
It's going to be
a very special party.

1369
01:15:19,895 --> 01:15:22,272
You have to be
under 60 to get in.

1370
01:15:28,403 --> 01:15:29,655
Well.

1371
01:15:29,738 --> 01:15:31,073
For a minute there,

1372
01:15:31,156 --> 01:15:32,866
I didn't think
I was going to make it.

1373
01:15:32,908 --> 01:15:34,409
You'll make it,
all right.

1374
01:15:34,451 --> 01:15:35,911
You can be bartender.

1375
01:15:35,953 --> 01:15:37,579
Oh, swell.

1376
01:15:38,372 --> 01:15:40,332
Do you really think
it's such a good idea?

1377
01:15:40,374 --> 01:15:42,918
I think it's the best idea
I've had in months.

1378
01:15:43,001 --> 01:15:45,921
Don't you think you ought to check
with Dr. Sapirstein first?

1379
01:15:46,004 --> 01:15:48,006
What for?
I'm just giving a party.

1380
01:15:48,090 --> 01:15:49,925
I'm not going to swim
the English Channel.

1381
01:15:49,967 --> 01:15:51,426
What about the pain?

1382
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:54,680
Oh, haven't you heard?

1383
01:15:54,888 --> 01:15:56,598
It'll go away
in a day or two.

1384
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:59,184
That looks interesting.
What's it for?

1385
01:15:59,226 --> 01:16:01,186
We're having some people
over on Saturday.

1386
01:16:01,228 --> 01:16:03,522
Oh, you feel up
to entertaining?

1387
01:16:03,564 --> 01:16:05,190
Yes, I do.
These are old friends

1388
01:16:05,232 --> 01:16:06,733
I haven't seen
in a long time.

1389
01:16:06,817 --> 01:16:08,861
They don't even know yet
that I'm pregnant.

1390
01:16:08,902 --> 01:16:10,237
I'll give you a hand
if you like.

1391
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:11,822
I'll help you
dish things out.

1392
01:16:11,905 --> 01:16:14,032
No, thank you, Minnie,
but I can manage.

1393
01:16:14,074 --> 01:16:15,742
It's going
to be a buffet,

1394
01:16:15,826 --> 01:16:17,578
and we're getting
a bartender, so...

1395
01:16:17,619 --> 01:16:18,996
I'll help you
take the coats.

1396
01:16:19,079 --> 01:16:22,958
No, really,
you do too much for me as it is.

1397
01:16:24,418 --> 01:16:27,337
Well, let me know
if you change your mind.

1398
01:16:27,338 --> 01:16:29,131
Drink your drink now.

1399
01:16:29,173 --> 01:16:30,632
I'd rather not.

1400
01:16:31,341 --> 01:16:32,926
Not right this minute.

1401
01:16:33,051 --> 01:16:35,012
I'll drink it
in a little while.

1402
01:16:35,095 --> 01:16:36,680
It don't do
to let it stand.

1403
01:16:36,763 --> 01:16:38,265
No, I won't wait too long.

1404
01:16:38,348 --> 01:16:41,059
You go on back, and I'll bring
the glass back to you later.

1405
01:16:41,101 --> 01:16:42,644
I'll wait.
I'll save you the walk.

1406
01:16:42,728 --> 01:16:45,063
You'll do no such thing.
It makes me very nervous

1407
01:16:45,147 --> 01:16:46,481
when people
watch me cook.

1408
01:16:46,523 --> 01:16:47,482
Now, scoot.

1409
01:16:47,524 --> 01:16:49,109
Don't let it
stand too long.

1410
01:16:49,193 --> 01:16:51,111
It's going to lose its vitamins.

1411
01:17:01,705 --> 01:17:05,918
You dirty, stinking secret-keeper.
Congratulations!

1412
01:17:05,959 --> 01:17:08,212
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

1413
01:17:09,630 --> 01:17:11,089
-Hey, Rosie.
-Yeah?

1414
01:17:11,173 --> 01:17:13,217
Bob and Leo got stuck
at another party, dear,

1415
01:17:13,258 --> 01:17:14,676
but they'll be over
right away.

1416
01:17:14,718 --> 01:17:15,636
Oh, fine.

1417
01:17:15,886 --> 01:17:19,223
Oh Rosie, you're so lucky.
It's a fantastic house.

1418
01:17:21,934 --> 01:17:24,645
Hi.
It's been so long!

1419
01:17:24,728 --> 01:17:27,898
You look like
a piece of chalk!

1420
01:17:28,232 --> 01:17:30,609
You make him
feed you, luv.

1421
01:17:33,403 --> 01:17:36,031
-Adrian Marcato lived here.
- Yeah, and the Trench sisters.

1422
01:17:36,073 --> 01:17:38,200
-Trent sisters?
-Trench. They ate little children.

1423
01:17:38,283 --> 01:17:40,827
He doesn't just mean
they ate them.

1424
01:17:40,911 --> 01:17:43,163
He means
they ate them.

1425
01:17:48,710 --> 01:17:50,546
I made their first one strong
to get them happy,

1426
01:17:50,629 --> 01:17:52,214
then I go light
and conserve, eh?

1427
01:17:52,297 --> 01:17:56,385
Rosie, do you feel O.K.?
You look a little tired.

1428
01:17:56,426 --> 01:17:58,720
Thanks for the understatement.

1429
01:18:01,515 --> 01:18:03,851
How do you like C.C. Hill?
Isn't he a dream boy?

1430
01:18:03,934 --> 01:18:05,769
Mm-hmm, but I--I--

1431
01:18:05,811 --> 01:18:07,104
I'm not going to him.

1432
01:18:08,021 --> 01:18:09,022
You're not?

1433
01:18:09,106 --> 01:18:12,985
I've got another doctor
named Sapirstein, an older man.

1434
01:18:13,068 --> 01:18:14,486
Oh, congratulations, Papa.

1435
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:16,071
Thanks. Weren't nothing to it.

1436
01:18:16,154 --> 01:18:17,614
Ro, I'm going to take
that dip inside.

1437
01:18:17,656 --> 01:18:20,450
Oh, yeah, please.
See my flowers?

1438
01:18:20,534 --> 01:18:21,493
Yeah.

1439
01:18:21,994 --> 01:18:23,537
Elise, will you give me a hand?

1440
01:18:23,620 --> 01:18:25,080
Oh, yeah, sure.

1441
01:18:30,669 --> 01:18:31,879
Hey, whatever happened
to the other guy?

1442
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:34,381
-Is he still blind?
-Donald Baumgart?

1443
01:18:34,423 --> 01:18:35,799
Well, you know who he is.

1444
01:18:35,883 --> 01:18:37,551
He's the boy that Zoe Piper
lives with.

1445
01:18:37,634 --> 01:18:39,094
He's writing a play.

1446
01:18:39,136 --> 01:18:40,596
-Is he still blind?
-Excuse me.

1447
01:18:41,388 --> 01:18:42,723
Yeah. He's going through hell

1448
01:18:42,764 --> 01:18:44,558
trying to make
the adjustment.

1449
01:18:44,641 --> 01:18:46,602
He dictates
and Zoe writes.

1450
01:18:54,526 --> 01:18:56,069
Are you all right?

1451
01:18:58,363 --> 01:18:59,781
Yeah, I'm fine.

1452
01:18:59,865 --> 01:19:02,075
I just had a cramp
for a minute.

1453
01:19:02,117 --> 01:19:03,076
Don't cry.

1454
01:19:03,118 --> 01:19:05,454
It's all right. It's good for her.
Let her cry it out.

1455
01:19:05,495 --> 01:19:07,122
It's all right, darling.
It's all right.

1456
01:19:07,206 --> 01:19:08,665
Sit down, sit down.

1457
01:19:14,546 --> 01:19:16,507
-Hey, let me in.
-Sorry, girls only.

1458
01:19:16,590 --> 01:19:18,675
-I want to talk to Rosemary.
-You can't. She's busy.

1459
01:19:18,717 --> 01:19:19,760
I have to wash these--

1460
01:19:19,801 --> 01:19:21,011
Use the bathroom.

1461
01:19:26,099 --> 01:19:27,559
It hurts so much!

1462
01:19:27,601 --> 01:19:29,853
I'm so afraid
the baby's gonna die.

1463
01:19:29,895 --> 01:19:32,314
When did the pain start?

1464
01:19:32,356 --> 01:19:33,815
Um...

1465
01:19:33,857 --> 01:19:35,817
in, uh, November.

1466
01:19:35,859 --> 01:19:37,319
November?

1467
01:19:37,361 --> 01:19:38,320
What?

1468
01:19:38,403 --> 01:19:40,822
You have been in pain
since November,

1469
01:19:40,864 --> 01:19:42,824
and he's not doing anything
to help you?

1470
01:19:42,866 --> 01:19:44,826
He says it's gonna stop.

1471
01:19:45,410 --> 01:19:47,246
Why don't you go
to see another doctor?

1472
01:19:47,287 --> 01:19:48,747
No, he's very good.

1473
01:19:49,540 --> 01:19:51,583
He was on Open End.

1474
01:19:51,625 --> 01:19:54,086
He sounds like
a sadistic nut.

1475
01:19:54,127 --> 01:19:56,088
Rosemary,
pain like that

1476
01:19:56,129 --> 01:19:59,591
is a warning that
something isn't right.

1477
01:19:59,633 --> 01:20:01,593
Go see Dr. Hill.

1478
01:20:01,635 --> 01:20:04,096
Go see anybody
besides that...that...

1479
01:20:04,137 --> 01:20:05,097
That nut.

1480
01:20:05,138 --> 01:20:07,391
You can't go on
suffering like this.

1481
01:20:07,474 --> 01:20:08,934
I won't have
an abortion.

1482
01:20:08,976 --> 01:20:10,936
Nobody's telling you
to have an abortion.

1483
01:20:10,978 --> 01:20:13,647
Just go to see another doctor,
that's all.

1484
01:20:22,614 --> 01:20:25,659
The thing to do now
is move.

1485
01:20:25,742 --> 01:20:26,660
Guy?

1486
01:20:26,743 --> 01:20:27,744
Yeah?

1487
01:20:27,828 --> 01:20:31,290
I'm going to Dr. Hill
Monday morning.

1488
01:20:32,207 --> 01:20:35,419
Dr. Sapirstein is either lying,
or he's...

1489
01:20:35,502 --> 01:20:37,671
I don't know,
out of his mind.

1490
01:20:37,754 --> 01:20:40,174
Pain like this is a warning
something's wrong.

1491
01:20:40,257 --> 01:20:41,300
Rosemary...

1492
01:20:41,383 --> 01:20:44,178
and I'm not drinking
Minnie's drink anymore.

1493
01:20:44,261 --> 01:20:47,222
I want vitamins and pills
like everyone else.

1494
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:50,350
I haven't drunk it
for the last three days.

1495
01:20:50,434 --> 01:20:51,476
I've thrown it away.

1496
01:20:51,518 --> 01:20:52,436
You've what?

1497
01:20:52,519 --> 01:20:54,479
I've made
my own drink.

1498
01:20:56,106 --> 01:20:58,859
Is that what those bitches
were giving you in there?

1499
01:21:00,110 --> 01:21:01,904
And is that
their hint for today?

1500
01:21:01,945 --> 01:21:02,946
They're my friends--

1501
01:21:03,030 --> 01:21:05,365
They're a bunch of
not very bright bitches

1502
01:21:05,449 --> 01:21:07,534
who ought to mind
their own goddamn business!

1503
01:21:07,576 --> 01:21:09,995
All they said was
get a second opinion.

1504
01:21:10,078 --> 01:21:11,496
Rosemary, you got the best doctor
in New York.

1505
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:12,956
You know
who Dr. Hill is?

1506
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:14,458
He's a Charlie Nobody.

1507
01:21:14,541 --> 01:21:15,667
That's who he is!

1508
01:21:15,709 --> 01:21:19,463
I'm tired of hearing
how great Dr. Sapirstein is.

1509
01:21:20,297 --> 01:21:22,633
Well, we'll have to pay Sapirstein,
we'll have to pay Hill.

1510
01:21:22,674 --> 01:21:24,092
It's out of
the question.

1511
01:21:24,176 --> 01:21:25,594
No, I'm not changing.

1512
01:21:25,677 --> 01:21:28,639
I just wanna go to Dr. Hill
and get a second opinion.

1513
01:21:28,889 --> 01:21:30,807
I won't let you do it, Ro.

1514
01:21:30,891 --> 01:21:32,809
I mean,
because it's, uh...

1515
01:21:32,893 --> 01:21:35,312
it's not fair
to Sapirstein.

1516
01:21:35,395 --> 01:21:37,814
Not fair to...

1517
01:21:37,898 --> 01:21:39,816
What are you
talking about?

1518
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:42,110
What about
what's fair to me?

1519
01:21:42,152 --> 01:21:43,570
You want
a second opinion?

1520
01:21:43,654 --> 01:21:47,699
You tell Sapirstein
and let him decide who gives it.

1521
01:21:47,741 --> 01:21:50,160
No! I want Dr. Hill!

1522
01:21:50,244 --> 01:21:52,162
At least have
that much courtesy--

1523
01:21:52,246 --> 01:21:54,665
If you won't pay,
then I'll...

1524
01:21:57,835 --> 01:21:59,753
Ro?

1525
01:21:59,795 --> 01:22:01,213
Rosemary?

1526
01:22:01,296 --> 01:22:02,714
What is it?

1527
01:22:04,091 --> 01:22:06,009
It stopped.

1528
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:08,262
What?

1529
01:22:08,345 --> 01:22:10,764
The pain stopped
just like that.

1530
01:22:10,848 --> 01:22:12,683
Stopped?
-Stopped.

1531
01:22:14,768 --> 01:22:17,688
What was in
that drink you made?

1532
01:22:19,314 --> 01:22:20,232
Uh...

1533
01:22:20,941 --> 01:22:23,861
eggs, milk, sug--

1534
01:22:23,944 --> 01:22:25,362
sugar.

1535
01:22:25,445 --> 01:22:26,864
What else?

1536
01:22:29,992 --> 01:22:31,451
What else?

1537
01:22:31,535 --> 01:22:36,415
Come on, Rosemary, for Christ's sake,
what else was in that drink?

1538
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,959
It's alive!

1539
01:22:39,042 --> 01:22:40,961
Guy, it's moving!

1540
01:22:41,044 --> 01:22:43,463
It's alive!
It's all right!

1541
01:22:43,547 --> 01:22:44,464
Feel.

1542
01:22:44,548 --> 01:22:45,465
Feel.

1543
01:22:45,549 --> 01:22:46,967
Oh, yeah, I felt it.

1544
01:22:47,050 --> 01:22:48,886
Don't be scared.
It won't bite you.

1545
01:22:48,969 --> 01:22:51,388
It's wonderful.
It really is.

1546
01:22:51,471 --> 01:22:53,390
I feel it kicking.

1547
01:22:53,473 --> 01:22:54,892
It's alive!

1548
01:22:54,975 --> 01:22:56,894
It's moving!

1549
01:23:00,981 --> 01:23:03,901
I'll, uh, clean up
some of this mess.

1550
01:23:20,918 --> 01:23:22,377
Watch the walls.

1551
01:23:31,428 --> 01:23:33,388
Thanks, boys.
Have one on the baby.

1552
01:23:33,430 --> 01:23:34,890
Thank you very much.

1553
01:24:04,211 --> 01:24:05,671
What's that for?

1554
01:24:05,712 --> 01:24:08,173
This is
my hospital suitcase.

1555
01:24:08,215 --> 01:24:10,676
Honey,
you got three weeks.

1556
01:24:16,682 --> 01:24:17,599
Yes?

1557
01:24:17,683 --> 01:24:19,601
Hello, Mrs. Cardiff.

1558
01:24:22,187 --> 01:24:23,105
No.

1559
01:24:24,690 --> 01:24:26,108
Oh, my God.

1560
01:24:28,193 --> 01:24:29,611
Oh, my God.

1561
01:24:29,695 --> 01:24:32,114
Yes, of course I will.

1562
01:24:44,168 --> 01:24:45,544
Hutch is dead.

1563
01:24:51,175 --> 01:24:52,593
I feel awful.

1564
01:24:52,676 --> 01:24:56,096
All this time,
I didn't even think of him.

1565
01:25:17,034 --> 01:25:18,952
Doris, we'll see you later.

1566
01:25:19,036 --> 01:25:20,454
I beg your pardon.

1567
01:25:20,537 --> 01:25:22,956
I'm Mrs. Woodhouse.
I knew your father.

1568
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:24,458
Oh, so you're Rosemary.

1569
01:25:24,541 --> 01:25:25,459
I'm terribly sorry.

1570
01:25:25,542 --> 01:25:27,503
Thank you.
This is my sister Edna.

1571
01:25:27,544 --> 01:25:28,462
How do you do?

1572
01:25:28,545 --> 01:25:29,963
And my husband.

1573
01:25:30,047 --> 01:25:30,964
How do you do?

1574
01:25:31,048 --> 01:25:31,965
I'm sorry to be late.

1575
01:25:32,049 --> 01:25:32,966
Excuse me.

1576
01:25:33,050 --> 01:25:33,967
Yes?

1577
01:25:34,051 --> 01:25:34,968
I'm Grace Cardiff.

1578
01:25:35,052 --> 01:25:36,470
I was hoping to meet you.

1579
01:25:36,553 --> 01:25:37,971
Thank you for calling me.

1580
01:25:38,055 --> 01:25:39,097
I was going to mail this,

1581
01:25:39,181 --> 01:25:40,474
but then I thought you
were going to be here.

1582
01:25:40,557 --> 01:25:42,601
What is it?
-A book.

1583
01:25:42,684 --> 01:25:44,978
Hutch regained consciousness
at the end,

1584
01:25:45,062 --> 01:25:46,980
and he thought it was
the next morning.

1585
01:25:47,481 --> 01:25:48,690
You know,
when you had the appointment.

1586
01:25:48,732 --> 01:25:49,650
Oh, yes.

1587
01:25:50,734 --> 01:25:52,361
I wasn't there,
but he told the doctor

1588
01:25:52,402 --> 01:25:54,821
to make sure you got the book
that was on his desk.

1589
01:25:54,905 --> 01:25:56,240
Thank you.

1590
01:25:57,658 --> 01:25:59,660
Oh, and I'm to tell you
the name is an anagram.

1591
01:26:00,369 --> 01:26:01,453
The name of the book?

1592
01:26:01,995 --> 01:26:03,247
Apparently.

1593
01:26:03,330 --> 01:26:06,625
He was delirious,
so it's hard to be sure.

1594
01:26:31,692 --> 01:26:32,651
I heard you come in.

1595
01:26:32,693 --> 01:26:34,111
It certainly
wasn't very long.

1596
01:26:34,194 --> 01:26:35,863
I was late.
I couldn't get a taxi.

1597
01:26:35,904 --> 01:26:37,322
Oh, what a shame.

1598
01:26:37,406 --> 01:26:39,324
Oh, you got mail already?

1599
01:26:39,408 --> 01:26:41,326
Somebody gave it to me.

1600
01:26:41,410 --> 01:26:43,829
Here. I'll hold it.

1601
01:26:43,912 --> 01:26:45,539
Book.

1602
01:26:46,623 --> 01:26:49,668
Oh, I know that house.
The Gilmores used to live there.

1603
01:26:49,751 --> 01:26:51,253
Oh?
-Yeah.

1604
01:26:51,461 --> 01:26:53,046
I've been there
lots of times.

1605
01:26:53,130 --> 01:26:55,549
Grace-- That's one
of my favorite names.

1606
01:26:55,632 --> 01:26:56,550
Yes.

1607
01:26:56,633 --> 01:26:58,051
You need anything?

1608
01:26:58,135 --> 01:26:59,052
Nothing, thank you.

1609
01:26:59,136 --> 01:27:00,053
Take a nap,
why don't you?

1610
01:27:00,137 --> 01:27:01,054
I'm going to.

1611
01:27:01,138 --> 01:27:02,055
Yeah. Goodbye.

1612
01:27:44,306 --> 01:27:46,725
"Born in Glasgow in 1846,

1613
01:27:46,808 --> 01:27:49,228
He was soon after
brought to New York.

1614
01:27:49,311 --> 01:27:52,231
He resided for several years
in the United St--

1615
01:27:52,314 --> 01:27:56,735
He was attacked by a mob
outside the Bram..."

1616
01:27:56,818 --> 01:28:00,280
Outside, not in the lobby.

1617
01:28:09,164 --> 01:28:10,582
There are no witches.

1618
01:28:10,666 --> 01:28:12,042
Not really.

1619
01:28:15,128 --> 01:28:17,047
The name is an anagram.

1620
01:29:39,963 --> 01:29:42,090
Now, that really makes sense.

1621
01:29:44,176 --> 01:29:45,594
Poor Hutch.

1622
01:30:42,067 --> 01:30:42,985
Ro?

1623
01:30:47,573 --> 01:30:48,991
What's with the chain?

1624
01:30:52,744 --> 01:30:54,204
What's the matter?

1625
01:30:55,747 --> 01:30:58,166
You all right?
-I'm fine.

1626
01:30:58,250 --> 01:30:59,668
Oh.

1627
01:30:59,751 --> 01:31:01,211
Oh, why, thank you.

1628
01:31:01,253 --> 01:31:03,213
How was the funeral?

1629
01:31:03,255 --> 01:31:04,381
O.K.

1630
01:31:04,423 --> 01:31:06,925
Got the shirt
that was in the New Yorker.

1631
01:31:11,930 --> 01:31:13,724
I got that shirt
that was in the New Yorker.

1632
01:31:14,349 --> 01:31:15,767
That's nice.

1633
01:31:15,851 --> 01:31:17,769
Do you know
who Roman really is?

1634
01:31:17,853 --> 01:31:18,979
What do you mean,
honey?

1635
01:31:19,021 --> 01:31:20,439
He's Adrian Marcato's son.

1636
01:31:20,522 --> 01:31:21,440
What?

1637
01:31:21,523 --> 01:31:22,941
Come here.

1638
01:31:23,025 --> 01:31:25,944
I want to show you something.

1639
01:31:26,028 --> 01:31:29,948
Roman Castavet
is Steven Marcato rearranged.

1640
01:31:31,533 --> 01:31:32,951
It's from Hutch.

1641
01:31:39,541 --> 01:31:40,459
Look.

1642
01:31:42,044 --> 01:31:43,462
And look here.

1643
01:31:43,545 --> 01:31:45,464
There he is when he was 13.

1644
01:31:45,547 --> 01:31:46,965
See the eyes?

1645
01:31:49,551 --> 01:31:50,469
Coincidence.

1646
01:31:50,552 --> 01:31:51,970
In the same house?

1647
01:31:52,054 --> 01:31:53,472
And look. Look here.

1648
01:31:53,555 --> 01:31:55,974
"Soon after that
in August, 1886,

1649
01:31:56,058 --> 01:31:57,976
his son Steven
was born."

1650
01:31:58,060 --> 01:31:59,478
1886. Got it?

1651
01:31:59,561 --> 01:32:01,480
That makes him 79 now.

1652
01:32:01,563 --> 01:32:02,981
No coincidence.

1653
01:32:08,070 --> 01:32:09,488
No, I guess not.

1654
01:32:10,656 --> 01:32:13,492
He's Steven Marcato,
all right.

1655
01:32:13,575 --> 01:32:14,493
Poor old geezer.

1656
01:32:14,576 --> 01:32:15,786
With a crazy father
like that,

1657
01:32:15,827 --> 01:32:18,247
no wonder he switched
his name around.

1658
01:32:18,330 --> 01:32:20,249
You don't think
he's the same?

1659
01:32:20,332 --> 01:32:22,251
What do you mean,
a witch?

1660
01:32:22,334 --> 01:32:23,752
Ro, are you kidding?

1661
01:32:23,836 --> 01:32:25,254
Oh, Ro, honey.

1662
01:32:27,005 --> 01:32:30,300
His father was a martyr to it.
Do you know how he died?

1663
01:32:30,342 --> 01:32:32,261
Honey, it's 1966.

1664
01:32:32,344 --> 01:32:35,097
This was published
in 1933.

1665
01:32:35,222 --> 01:32:36,431
There were covens
in Europe.

1666
01:32:36,473 --> 01:32:39,309
That's what they're called--
the congregation.

1667
01:32:39,726 --> 01:32:42,187
Covens in Europe, in America,
and in Australia,

1668
01:32:42,229 --> 01:32:44,648
and they have one right here,
that whole bunch.

1669
01:32:44,731 --> 01:32:47,276
The parties with the singing
and the flute and the chanting,

1670
01:32:47,317 --> 01:32:49,152
those are esbats or sabbaths
or whatever they're called.

1671
01:32:49,194 --> 01:32:50,320
Honey, don't get excited.

1672
01:32:50,362 --> 01:32:51,780
Read what they do, Guy.

1673
01:32:51,864 --> 01:32:53,782
They use blood
in their rituals.

1674
01:32:53,866 --> 01:32:56,785
The blood that has the most power
is baby's blood.

1675
01:32:56,869 --> 01:32:58,787
And they don't just use the blood,
they use the flesh, too.

1676
01:32:58,871 --> 01:33:00,289
Rosemary,
for God's sakes!

1677
01:33:00,747 --> 01:33:03,125
They're not setting foot
in this apartment ever again.

1678
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:05,627
They're not coming within 50 feet
of the baby.

1679
01:33:05,669 --> 01:33:06,587
They're old people.

1680
01:33:06,670 --> 01:33:08,088
They have a bunch
of old friends.

1681
01:33:08,172 --> 01:33:10,591
Dr. Shand happens
to play the recorder.

1682
01:33:10,674 --> 01:33:13,552
I'm not taking any chances
with the baby's safety.

1683
01:33:13,594 --> 01:33:15,053
We're gonna sublet
and move out.

1684
01:33:15,095 --> 01:33:16,555
We are not.
-Oh, yes we are!

1685
01:33:16,597 --> 01:33:18,515
We'll talk about it later.

1686
01:33:21,602 --> 01:33:24,146
I don't think you ought
to read any more of that.

1687
01:33:24,980 --> 01:33:27,524
-Just this last chapter.
-Not today, honey.

1688
01:33:28,692 --> 01:33:31,028
Look. Your hands are shaking.
Come on. Give it to me.

1689
01:33:31,069 --> 01:33:32,863
Read it tomorrow.
-Guy!

1690
01:33:32,946 --> 01:33:34,406
I mean it, now.

1691
01:33:34,448 --> 01:33:35,908
Give it to me.

1692
01:33:43,332 --> 01:33:46,251
Fantastic.
Absolutely fantastic.

1693
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:47,961
What'd you say the name was,
"Marchado"?

1694
01:33:48,003 --> 01:33:49,129
Marcato.

1695
01:33:49,171 --> 01:33:51,548
He told me his father
was a coffee importer.

1696
01:33:51,798 --> 01:33:53,258
He told Guy
he was a producer.

1697
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:55,010
I understand
how disturbed you must be

1698
01:33:55,052 --> 01:33:56,512
to have him for
a close neighbor.

1699
01:33:56,553 --> 01:33:59,014
I don't want anything more
to do with him or Minnie.

1700
01:33:59,056 --> 01:34:02,518
I can't take even the slightest chance
for the baby's sake.

1701
01:34:02,559 --> 01:34:05,020
Absolutely.
Any mother'd feel the same way.

1702
01:34:05,062 --> 01:34:07,022
Is there
any chance at all

1703
01:34:07,064 --> 01:34:09,024
that maybe Minnie put something
harmful in those drinks

1704
01:34:09,066 --> 01:34:10,526
or in those
little cakes?

1705
01:34:10,567 --> 01:34:13,946
No, Rosemary, I'd have seen evidence
of it long ago.

1706
01:34:14,821 --> 01:34:16,573
I won't take anything else
from them.

1707
01:34:16,657 --> 01:34:17,574
You won't have to.

1708
01:34:17,658 --> 01:34:19,076
I can give you some pills

1709
01:34:19,159 --> 01:34:22,079
that'll be adequate
these last few weeks.

1710
01:34:22,162 --> 01:34:25,082
In a way,
this may be the answer

1711
01:34:25,165 --> 01:34:27,084
to Minnie's and
Roman's problem, too.

1712
01:34:27,167 --> 01:34:28,585
What do you mean?

1713
01:34:28,669 --> 01:34:30,087
Roman's very ill.

1714
01:34:30,170 --> 01:34:34,091
In fact, confidentially, he has
no more than a month or two left.

1715
01:34:34,174 --> 01:34:35,592
I had no idea.

1716
01:34:35,676 --> 01:34:38,095
He wanted to pay a last visit
to a few of his favorite cities.

1717
01:34:38,178 --> 01:34:39,096
They didn't want
to offend you

1718
01:34:39,179 --> 01:34:41,098
by leaving before
the baby's birth.

1719
01:34:41,723 --> 01:34:43,642
I'm sorry to hear
that Roman isn't well.

1720
01:34:43,725 --> 01:34:45,143
He'd be
extremely embarrassed

1721
01:34:45,227 --> 01:34:47,646
if he knew
what you found out.

1722
01:34:47,729 --> 01:34:48,647
Suppose we do this.

1723
01:34:48,730 --> 01:34:50,232
I'll tell him
to leave on Sunday.

1724
01:34:50,274 --> 01:34:52,359
I'll say I spoke to you
and you understand.

1725
01:34:52,693 --> 01:34:55,112
Are you sure they'll
leave on Sunday?

1726
01:34:55,195 --> 01:34:56,613
I'll see to it.

1727
01:34:59,283 --> 01:35:00,742
No matter
where we are,

1728
01:35:00,784 --> 01:35:02,369
our thoughts are gonna be with you
every minute

1729
01:35:02,452 --> 01:35:04,705
till you're all
happy and thin again.

1730
01:35:04,788 --> 01:35:07,791
Your sweet little boy or girl
laying safely in your arms.

1731
01:35:07,833 --> 01:35:09,293
Thank you.
Thank you for everything.

1732
01:35:09,334 --> 01:35:11,712
Yeah. You make Guy
send us lots of pictures, ya hear?

1733
01:35:11,795 --> 01:35:13,213
Yes, I will.

1734
01:35:13,297 --> 01:35:14,715
Now, I'm not going
to wish you good luck

1735
01:35:14,798 --> 01:35:16,216
because you
won't need it.

1736
01:35:16,300 --> 01:35:18,719
You're going to have
a happy, happy life.

1737
01:35:18,802 --> 01:35:21,221
Have a good trip
and come back safely.

1738
01:35:21,305 --> 01:35:25,225
Perhaps. But I may stay in Dubrovnik
or Pescara

1739
01:35:25,309 --> 01:35:26,727
or maybe Majorca.

1740
01:35:26,810 --> 01:35:28,729
We shall see,
we shall see.

1741
01:35:28,812 --> 01:35:29,730
Come back.

1742
01:35:29,813 --> 01:35:30,731
Bye, Minnie.

1743
01:35:30,814 --> 01:35:31,732
Yeah, goodbye.

1744
01:35:31,815 --> 01:35:33,233
Goodbye, Roman.
Bye-bye.

1745
01:35:33,317 --> 01:35:34,735
Take care now.

1746
01:35:34,818 --> 01:35:36,862
Kennedy Airport,
Pan Am Building.

1747
01:35:36,945 --> 01:35:38,238
Bye!

1748
01:35:38,322 --> 01:35:39,531
Bye, Roman.

1749
01:35:42,201 --> 01:35:43,619
Oh, boy.

1750
01:35:49,875 --> 01:35:50,876
Guy?

1751
01:35:50,876 --> 01:35:51,502
Hmm?

1752
01:35:51,585 --> 01:35:53,170
Where's my book?

1753
01:35:53,253 --> 01:35:56,757
Oh, I put it
in the garbage.

1754
01:35:58,300 --> 01:35:59,218
What?

1755
01:35:59,301 --> 01:36:02,054
I didn't want you
upsetting yourself anymore.

1756
01:36:02,137 --> 01:36:04,097
Guy, Hutch gave me that book.

1757
01:36:04,139 --> 01:36:05,599
He left it to me.

1758
01:36:05,641 --> 01:36:07,100
I wasn't thinking
about that.

1759
01:36:07,142 --> 01:36:08,602
That's a terrible thing to do.

1760
01:36:08,644 --> 01:36:11,605
I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking about Hutch.

1761
01:36:18,111 --> 01:36:20,030
Hey, watch out, lady!

1762
01:37:14,168 --> 01:37:19,548
"Some cultures believed that a personal
possession of the victim is necessary

1763
01:37:19,590 --> 01:37:21,425
and spells cannot be cast

1764
01:37:21,466 --> 01:37:24,386
without one of the victim's
belongings."

1765
01:37:24,469 --> 01:37:25,387
Yeah?

1766
01:37:26,138 --> 01:37:27,556
Is this Donald Baumgart?

1767
01:37:27,639 --> 01:37:28,557
That's right.

1768
01:37:29,308 --> 01:37:31,185
This is Rosemary Woodhouse,

1769
01:37:31,268 --> 01:37:32,686
Guy Woodhouse's wife.

1770
01:37:32,769 --> 01:37:33,687
Oh, yes.

1771
01:37:33,770 --> 01:37:35,189
I want to know--

1772
01:37:35,272 --> 01:37:37,691
You must be
a happy little lady,

1773
01:37:37,774 --> 01:37:40,194
living in the Bram,
rows of uniformed lackeys.

1774
01:37:40,277 --> 01:37:41,695
I wanted to know
how you are,

1775
01:37:41,778 --> 01:37:42,779
if there's been
any improvement.

1776
01:37:42,863 --> 01:37:44,281
Well, bless your heart.

1777
01:37:46,283 --> 01:37:47,701
Guy Woodhouse's wife, huh?

1778
01:37:47,784 --> 01:37:49,203
Well, I'm splendid.

1779
01:37:49,286 --> 01:37:52,706
I only broke
six glasses today.

1780
01:37:53,790 --> 01:37:56,210
Guy and I
are both very unhappy

1781
01:37:56,293 --> 01:38:00,714
that he got his break
because of your misfortune.

1782
01:38:02,257 --> 01:38:04,176
Aw, what the hell.

1783
01:38:04,259 --> 01:38:07,179
That's the way it goes, right?

1784
01:38:07,262 --> 01:38:11,683
I'm sorry I didn't come along that day
he came to visit you.

1785
01:38:11,767 --> 01:38:13,602
V-Visit?

1786
01:38:13,685 --> 01:38:17,105
Oh, you mean the day
we met for drinks?

1787
01:38:17,648 --> 01:38:20,067
Yes, that's what I meant.

1788
01:38:20,734 --> 01:38:23,570
By the way,
he has something of yours, you know.

1789
01:38:23,654 --> 01:38:25,072
What do you mean?

1790
01:38:25,155 --> 01:38:27,074
Don't you know?

1791
01:38:27,157 --> 01:38:28,075
No.

1792
01:38:28,158 --> 01:38:30,577
Didn't you miss anything
that day?

1793
01:38:32,037 --> 01:38:35,082
You don't mean my tie,
do you?

1794
01:38:35,165 --> 01:38:35,832
Yes.

1795
01:38:35,916 --> 01:38:39,169
Oh, well, he's got mine,
and I've got his.

1796
01:38:40,170 --> 01:38:41,421
He can have it back.

1797
01:38:41,505 --> 01:38:42,673
I'm sorry.

1798
01:38:42,756 --> 01:38:46,426
Doesn't matter to me now
what color tie I'm wearing.

1799
01:38:46,510 --> 01:38:48,929
I didn't understand.
I thought he'd only borrowed it.

1800
01:38:49,012 --> 01:38:51,932
Oh, no.
It was a trade.

1801
01:38:52,015 --> 01:38:53,433
Or...

1802
01:38:53,517 --> 01:38:55,435
do you think
he stole it?

1803
01:38:55,519 --> 01:38:57,437
I have to hang up now.

1804
01:38:57,521 --> 01:39:00,440
I just wanted to know if there'd been
any improvement.

1805
01:39:00,524 --> 01:39:01,942
No, no, there isn't.

1806
01:39:02,025 --> 01:39:04,945
It was nice of you to call. Bye.

1807
01:39:42,316 --> 01:39:43,942
You aren't in labor,
are you?

1808
01:39:43,984 --> 01:39:45,944
No, but I have
to see the doctor.

1809
01:39:45,986 --> 01:39:46,945
It's very important.

1810
01:39:46,987 --> 01:39:48,447
But he has to leave
00,

1811
01:39:48,488 --> 01:39:50,449
and there is Mrs. Byron.

1812
01:39:50,490 --> 01:39:52,451
I'm sure he'll see you.
Just sit down.

1813
01:39:52,492 --> 01:39:53,452
Thank you.

1814
01:40:15,474 --> 01:40:17,392
How is it out there?

1815
01:40:17,476 --> 01:40:19,853
Oh, awful. 94.

1816
01:40:19,937 --> 01:40:20,896
Ugh!

1817
01:40:20,979 --> 01:40:22,898
See you next week.
Make an appointment.

1818
01:40:22,981 --> 01:40:24,399
Yes, I will.

1819
01:40:30,405 --> 01:40:32,324
You're due any day now,
aren't you?

1820
01:40:32,407 --> 01:40:32,950
Tuesday.

1821
01:40:32,991 --> 01:40:35,953
You're smart to get it over with
before August.

1822
01:40:37,287 --> 01:40:38,205
Mrs. Byron.

1823
01:40:39,373 --> 01:40:41,792
He'll see you right after.

1824
01:40:41,875 --> 01:40:43,877
Well, let's see, um...

1825
01:40:43,919 --> 01:40:45,379
July the 10th?

1826
01:40:45,420 --> 01:40:46,797
What time?

1827
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:47,798
00?

1828
01:40:47,881 --> 01:40:48,799
Fine.

1829
01:40:48,882 --> 01:40:50,300
All right.
See you then.

1830
01:40:50,384 --> 01:40:51,718
Thank you.
-Bye-bye.

1831
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:52,719
Good luck.

1832
01:40:52,761 --> 01:40:53,971
Thank you.

1833
01:41:01,186 --> 01:41:04,064
Mmm! That smells nice.
What is it?

1834
01:41:05,774 --> 01:41:06,942
Oh, my--

1835
01:41:07,025 --> 01:41:09,444
It's called detchema.

1836
01:41:09,528 --> 01:41:11,196
Well, it's a big improvement
on your regular,

1837
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:12,656
if you don't mind
my saying.

1838
01:41:12,698 --> 01:41:14,157
That wasn't a perfume.

1839
01:41:14,199 --> 01:41:15,450
That was a good luck charm.

1840
01:41:15,492 --> 01:41:16,451
I threw it away.

1841
01:41:16,493 --> 01:41:17,578
Good.

1842
01:41:18,370 --> 01:41:21,832
Maybe the doctor will follow
your example.

1843
01:41:25,836 --> 01:41:27,296
Dr. Sapirstein?

1844
01:41:27,337 --> 01:41:28,797
Yes. The aftershave.

1845
01:41:28,839 --> 01:41:30,799
Well, it isn't, is it?

1846
01:41:30,841 --> 01:41:33,177
I don't think he has
a good luck charm.

1847
01:41:33,260 --> 01:41:35,721
Anyway, he has the same smell
once in a while.

1848
01:41:36,597 --> 01:41:38,557
When he does--
Oh, boy.

1849
01:41:39,433 --> 01:41:41,185
Haven't you ever noticed?

1850
01:41:41,268 --> 01:41:42,728
No.

1851
01:41:42,769 --> 01:41:46,023
Well, maybe you thought it was your own
you were smelling.

1852
01:41:46,106 --> 01:41:48,567
What is it,
a chemical thing?

1853
01:41:49,443 --> 01:41:51,820
Will you excuse me a moment,
please?

1854
01:41:51,862 --> 01:41:53,197
My husband
is waiting outside.

1855
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,240
I have to go
and tell him something.

1856
01:41:55,282 --> 01:41:57,117
I'll be back in a minute.

1857
01:42:45,332 --> 01:42:46,792
Dr. Hil"s office.

1858
01:42:46,834 --> 01:42:47,793
Dr. Hill, please.

1859
01:42:47,835 --> 01:42:49,294
This is his
answering service.

1860
01:42:49,336 --> 01:42:51,797
Would you like
to leave a message?

1861
01:42:51,839 --> 01:42:55,801
Um, yes.
My name is Rosemary Woodhouse.

1862
01:42:55,843 --> 01:42:57,302
Woodhouse.

1863
01:42:57,344 --> 01:43:01,807
And would you ask him to call me back
right away, please?

1864
01:43:01,849 --> 01:43:06,812
Uh, my number is
475-2598.

1865
01:43:06,854 --> 01:43:09,314
It's an emergency.
I'm in a phone booth.

1866
01:43:09,356 --> 01:43:10,315
All right.

1867
01:43:20,325 --> 01:43:23,245
Quickly, please,
Dr. Hill, call me.

1868
01:43:30,335 --> 01:43:31,753
Oh, oh, really?

1869
01:43:31,837 --> 01:43:33,755
Did he really say that?

1870
01:43:33,839 --> 01:43:36,258
Oh, he didn't say that.

1871
01:43:36,341 --> 01:43:39,261
What else was it
that he said?

1872
01:43:39,344 --> 01:43:40,762
Oh, that's wonderful.

1873
01:43:40,846 --> 01:43:43,265
That's wonder--
That's marvelous.

1874
01:43:44,349 --> 01:43:45,267
Yes. Dr. Hill?

1875
01:43:45,350 --> 01:43:46,268
Did I get the name right?

1876
01:43:46,351 --> 01:43:47,769
Is it Rosemary Woodhouse?

1877
01:43:47,853 --> 01:43:48,770
Yes.

1878
01:43:48,854 --> 01:43:50,772
Are you Dr. Hil"s patient?

1879
01:43:50,856 --> 01:43:51,815
No.

1880
01:43:51,899 --> 01:43:55,277
Um, yes, I mean,
well, I've seen him once.

1881
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:58,405
Um, please, please tell him
he has to speak to me.

1882
01:43:58,447 --> 01:43:59,364
It's important.

1883
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:01,742
Tell him to call me, hmm?

1884
01:44:01,783 --> 01:44:03,702
-All right.
-Thank you.

1885
01:44:10,709 --> 01:44:12,044
All of them.

1886
01:44:12,127 --> 01:44:13,545
All of them.

1887
01:44:13,629 --> 01:44:15,547
All in it together.

1888
01:44:15,631 --> 01:44:17,049
All of them.

1889
01:44:17,132 --> 01:44:19,051
All of them witches.

1890
01:44:19,134 --> 01:44:21,553
Don't you worry,
little Andy or Jenny,

1891
01:44:21,637 --> 01:44:25,057
I'll kill them before
I let them touch you.

1892
01:44:29,144 --> 01:44:30,062
Yes. Dr...

1893
01:44:30,145 --> 01:44:31,063
Mrs. Woodhouse?

1894
01:44:31,146 --> 01:44:32,105
Yes!

1895
01:44:32,189 --> 01:44:35,067
Oh, thank you,
Thank you for calling me.

1896
01:44:35,150 --> 01:44:36,568
Thought you were
in California.

1897
01:44:36,652 --> 01:44:40,072
No. No, I've been
to another doctor,

1898
01:44:40,155 --> 01:44:42,574
and he isn't good,
Dr. Hill.

1899
01:44:42,658 --> 01:44:44,576
He's been lying to me

1900
01:44:44,660 --> 01:44:48,580
and giving me unusual kinds
of drinks and capsules.

1901
01:44:48,664 --> 01:44:50,582
The baby's due
on Tuesday.

1902
01:44:50,666 --> 01:44:52,084
Remember you told me
June 28th?

1903
01:44:52,167 --> 01:44:54,086
Well, I want you
to deliver it.

1904
01:44:54,169 --> 01:44:55,587
Mrs. Woodhouse...

1905
01:44:55,671 --> 01:44:57,589
Please let me
talk to you.

1906
01:44:57,673 --> 01:45:00,592
Let me come and explain
what's been going on.

1907
01:45:00,676 --> 01:45:02,594
I can't stay too long here.

1908
01:45:02,678 --> 01:45:05,097
They'll be coming,
looking for me.

1909
01:45:05,180 --> 01:45:06,098
Dr. Hill?

1910
01:45:06,181 --> 01:45:08,100
Dr. Hill,
there's a plot--

1911
01:45:08,183 --> 01:45:10,102
I know that sounds crazy.

1912
01:45:10,185 --> 01:45:11,603
You're probably thinking,

1913
01:45:11,687 --> 01:45:13,564
"My God, this poor girl
has really flipped,"

1914
01:45:13,605 --> 01:45:16,567
but I haven't flipped,
Dr. Hill, I swear.

1915
01:45:16,608 --> 01:45:18,318
By all the saints,
I haven't.

1916
01:45:18,402 --> 01:45:20,863
There are plots against people,
aren't there?

1917
01:45:20,904 --> 01:45:22,364
Yes, I suppose there are.

1918
01:45:22,406 --> 01:45:25,868
Well, then there's one against me
and my baby.

1919
01:45:27,452 --> 01:45:30,038
Come to my office
00.

1920
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:31,039
No!

1921
01:45:31,081 --> 01:45:32,082
Right now.

1922
01:45:32,958 --> 01:45:34,835
Mrs. Woodhouse,
I'm not at my office now.

1923
01:45:34,918 --> 01:45:36,837
I'm home. I've been up
since yesterday morning.

1924
01:45:36,879 --> 01:45:38,338
I beg you.

1925
01:45:38,380 --> 01:45:39,840
I beg you.

1926
01:45:41,133 --> 01:45:43,594
I can't stay here.

1927
01:45:44,428 --> 01:45:47,389
00.
-Yes, thank you.

1928
01:45:47,431 --> 01:45:48,557
Oh, wait! Dr. Hill?

1929
01:45:48,599 --> 01:45:49,558
Yes?

1930
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:52,060
My husband may call you,
asking--

1931
01:45:52,102 --> 01:45:55,063
I'm not gonna speak to anyone.
I'm gonna take a nap.

1932
01:45:55,105 --> 01:45:56,064
Thank you.

1933
01:46:29,973 --> 01:46:31,600
Keep the change.

1934
01:46:31,642 --> 01:46:33,852
Uh, driver, please,

1935
01:46:33,894 --> 01:46:38,524
could you wait and watch until--
until I'm inside the door?

1936
01:46:54,081 --> 01:46:55,415
He lied to you.

1937
01:46:55,415 --> 01:46:57,334
He said we were
going to Hollywood.

1938
01:46:57,334 --> 01:46:58,377
The worst thing of all,

1939
01:46:58,460 --> 01:46:59,920
he's involved
with them as well.

1940
01:47:00,838 --> 01:47:02,339
He sleeps in pajamas now.

1941
01:47:02,381 --> 01:47:03,715
He never used to before.

1942
01:47:03,757 --> 01:47:05,509
He's probably
hiding a mark.

1943
01:47:05,592 --> 01:47:07,719
You know they give you marks
when you join--

1944
01:47:07,803 --> 01:47:09,429
All sorts of rituals.

1945
01:47:09,513 --> 01:47:11,306
They hold sabbaths there.

1946
01:47:11,390 --> 01:47:13,267
You could hear them singing
through the wall.

1947
01:47:13,350 --> 01:47:16,436
Guy, my husband Guy
said it was Dr. Shand,

1948
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:18,647
one of these people
playing a recorder.

1949
01:47:18,730 --> 01:47:21,358
Now, how did he know
it was Dr. Shand

1950
01:47:21,441 --> 01:47:23,777
unless he was there
with them?

1951
01:47:23,819 --> 01:47:26,947
Um, they're very clever people.

1952
01:47:27,030 --> 01:47:29,116
They planned everything right
from the beginning.

1953
01:47:29,199 --> 01:47:32,119
They probably made
some sort of deal with Guy.

1954
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:35,873
They gave him success,
and he promised them our baby

1955
01:47:35,956 --> 01:47:38,292
to use in their rituals.

1956
01:47:38,375 --> 01:47:40,002
I know
this sounds crazy,

1957
01:47:40,043 --> 01:47:43,714
but I've--I've got books here.
Look.

1958
01:47:44,798 --> 01:47:48,385
There was another actor like him,
Donald Baumgart,

1959
01:47:48,427 --> 01:47:50,137
and they put
a spell on him.

1960
01:47:50,179 --> 01:47:52,598
They cast a spell on him
and made him blind

1961
01:47:52,681 --> 01:47:54,600
so that Guy
could get his part.

1962
01:47:54,683 --> 01:47:56,643
Look, here.

1963
01:47:58,854 --> 01:48:01,023
I had this friend
Edward Hutchins.

1964
01:48:01,106 --> 01:48:02,858
Maybe you heard of him,
a writer.

1965
01:48:02,941 --> 01:48:04,443
He wrote stories
for boys.

1966
01:48:04,526 --> 01:48:05,944
Anyway, he was my good friend

1967
01:48:06,028 --> 01:48:07,404
since I first came
to New York.

1968
01:48:07,487 --> 01:48:08,780
May I keep this?

1969
01:48:08,864 --> 01:48:12,451
Yes, please,
and, look, anyway,

1970
01:48:12,534 --> 01:48:15,370
once Mr. Hutchins
came to visit me--

1971
01:48:15,412 --> 01:48:19,499
Came to visit me. It was the time
I was having this pain, Doctor.

1972
01:48:19,541 --> 01:48:23,587
I was suffering so-- You can't
imagine how much I was suffering,

1973
01:48:23,670 --> 01:48:25,547
and they wouldn't help me.
Nobody would.

1974
01:48:25,589 --> 01:48:28,967
They were giving me a drink
with tannis root in it.

1975
01:48:29,051 --> 01:48:32,137
Also witches' stuff,
tannis root.

1976
01:48:32,221 --> 01:48:35,349
Hutch came, and he immediately saw
something was wrong.

1977
01:48:35,390 --> 01:48:37,309
He--He knew about witches,
you see.

1978
01:48:37,392 --> 01:48:40,354
Suddenly, Guy rushed in with his makeup
still on,

1979
01:48:40,395 --> 01:48:41,563
which he never did.

1980
01:48:41,647 --> 01:48:44,191
They probably
called him to come home

1981
01:48:44,274 --> 01:48:46,151
and steal one of
Hutch's belongings,

1982
01:48:46,235 --> 01:48:48,070
which he did.
Took his glove,

1983
01:48:48,153 --> 01:48:50,113
and they put a spell
on him, too.

1984
01:48:50,197 --> 01:48:54,535
Put him in a coma.
Three months later, he died.

1985
01:48:54,576 --> 01:48:57,079
Now, maybe all of this
is coincidence,

1986
01:48:57,120 --> 01:48:58,455
but one thing
is for sure.

1987
01:48:58,539 --> 01:49:00,707
They have a coven
and they want my baby.

1988
01:49:04,002 --> 01:49:06,046
Certainly seems that way.

1989
01:49:16,098 --> 01:49:18,433
I was afraid you
wouldn't believe me.

1990
01:49:18,517 --> 01:49:20,102
I don't believe
in witchcraft,

1991
01:49:20,185 --> 01:49:23,772
but there are plenty of maniacs
and crazy people in this city.

1992
01:49:23,856 --> 01:49:25,524
The doctor's name is Shand,
you say?

1993
01:49:25,607 --> 01:49:28,986
N-No, Dr. Shand is
one of these people.

1994
01:49:29,069 --> 01:49:31,071
The doctor's name
is Sapirstein.

1995
01:49:31,989 --> 01:49:34,241
Abraham Sapirstein?

1996
01:49:34,575 --> 01:49:37,035
Yeah.

1997
01:49:37,119 --> 01:49:38,287
Do you know him?

1998
01:49:38,328 --> 01:49:40,581
I've met him once or twice.

1999
01:49:40,664 --> 01:49:42,416
To look at him,
you'd never think he--

2000
01:49:42,457 --> 01:49:45,169
No, you wouldn't.
Not in a million years.

2001
01:49:45,878 --> 01:49:47,796
Would you like to go
into Mount Sinai right now,

2002
01:49:47,838 --> 01:49:49,464
this evening?

2003
01:49:49,548 --> 01:49:53,093
Yeah, I would love to.
Would that be possible?

2004
01:49:53,177 --> 01:49:55,429
It's difficult,
but we'll try.

2005
01:49:56,180 --> 01:49:58,974
I want you to lie down
and get some rest.

2006
01:49:59,016 --> 01:50:00,017
Yes.

2007
01:50:00,100 --> 01:50:03,353
Anything they've got,
even a broom closet'd be fine.

2008
01:50:03,437 --> 01:50:05,856
I hope we can
do better than that.

2009
01:50:11,820 --> 01:50:15,657
I'll see what I can do,
then I'll check you over.

2010
01:50:17,868 --> 01:50:19,244
Oh, should I undress now?

2011
01:50:19,328 --> 01:50:22,039
No. It'll take me about
a half-hour on the telephone.

2012
01:50:22,122 --> 01:50:24,166
You just lie down, rest.

2013
01:50:26,168 --> 01:50:27,085
O.K.?

2014
01:50:27,169 --> 01:50:28,253
O.K.

2015
01:50:36,678 --> 01:50:38,972
God bless Dr. Hill.

2016
01:50:44,895 --> 01:50:48,524
Everything's going to be O.K. now,
Andy or Jenny.

2017
01:50:48,607 --> 01:50:51,985
We're going to be in a nice,
clean hospital

2018
01:50:52,027 --> 01:50:53,987
with no visitors.

2019
01:50:56,532 --> 01:50:57,616
Oh.

2020
01:51:15,050 --> 01:51:16,802
Monsters.

2021
01:51:19,638 --> 01:51:20,931
Monsters.

2022
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:27,020
Unspeakable.

2023
01:51:27,062 --> 01:51:28,856
Unspeakable.

2024
01:52:00,429 --> 01:52:02,222
I was sleeping.

2025
01:52:16,445 --> 01:52:18,822
Come with us quietly,
Rosemary.

2026
01:52:18,906 --> 01:52:20,949
Don't argue or make a scene

2027
01:52:21,033 --> 01:52:23,452
because if you say anything more about
witches or witchcraft,

2028
01:52:23,493 --> 01:52:25,913
we're going to be forced to take you
to a mental hospital.

2029
01:52:25,996 --> 01:52:28,040
You don't want that,
do you?

2030
01:52:28,123 --> 01:52:29,291
So put your shoes on.

2031
01:52:29,374 --> 01:52:31,710
Wejust want
to take you home.

2032
01:52:31,793 --> 01:52:32,920
No one's going
to hurt you.

2033
01:52:32,961 --> 01:52:36,423
Or the baby.
Put your shoes on.

2034
01:52:54,358 --> 01:52:55,776
She's fine now.

2035
01:52:56,151 --> 01:52:58,153
We're going to go home and rest.

2036
01:52:58,237 --> 01:52:59,488
That's all it takes.

2037
01:52:59,571 --> 01:53:00,989
Thank you for your trouble,
Doctor.

2038
01:53:01,031 --> 01:53:02,699
Glad I could be of help, sir.

2039
01:53:02,741 --> 01:53:04,701
It's a shame you had to come in here.

2040
01:53:57,963 --> 01:53:59,965
Good evening,
Mrs. Woodhouse.

2041
01:54:15,480 --> 01:54:17,441
Mrs. Woodhouse!

2042
01:54:17,482 --> 01:54:19,443
Mrs. Woodhouse!

2043
01:54:44,468 --> 01:54:45,469
Uhh!

2044
01:55:23,590 --> 01:55:24,633
Ro!

2045
01:55:24,716 --> 01:55:26,093
Ro!

2046
01:55:26,134 --> 01:55:27,427
Ro!

2047
01:55:28,971 --> 01:55:30,764
Ro, baby, Ro!

2048
01:55:30,806 --> 01:55:32,015
Ro!

2049
01:55:35,269 --> 01:55:36,395
Come on, open up, Ro.

2050
01:55:36,436 --> 01:55:37,521
Go to hell!

2051
01:55:37,604 --> 01:55:38,564
Come on, honey.
No one's going to hurt you.

2052
01:55:38,647 --> 01:55:40,899
You promised them the baby,
get out!

2053
01:55:40,983 --> 01:55:42,317
No, I didn't promise
them anything.

2054
01:55:42,401 --> 01:55:43,360
What are you talking about?
Promised who?

2055
01:55:43,443 --> 01:55:44,361
Rosemary, you're--

2056
01:55:44,444 --> 01:55:46,738
You, too! Get away!

2057
01:56:18,729 --> 01:56:19,688
Hello.

2058
01:56:19,730 --> 01:56:20,439
Elise?

2059
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:21,481
Mrs. Dunstan is out.

2060
01:56:21,940 --> 01:56:23,317
-Who is this?
-The babysitter.

2061
01:56:23,358 --> 01:56:24,318
Do you know
where she went?

2062
01:56:24,359 --> 01:56:25,611
They went
to the movies.

2063
01:56:26,236 --> 01:56:29,072
This is Rosemary.
Please ask her to call Rosemary

2064
01:56:29,114 --> 01:56:30,574
the second
she gets home.

2065
01:56:30,616 --> 01:56:33,660
It's terribly urgent.
Don't-- Don't forget.

2066
01:56:33,744 --> 01:56:35,329
Don't worry.
I'll tell her.

2067
01:56:35,412 --> 01:56:36,580
Thank you.

2068
01:56:43,462 --> 01:56:44,922
We don't want
to hurt you, Ro.

2069
01:56:46,715 --> 01:56:48,342
We're your friends,
Rosemary.

2070
01:56:48,425 --> 01:56:50,052
There's nothing to be afraid of,
Rosemary.

2071
01:56:50,135 --> 01:56:51,678
Honest and truly there isn't.

2072
01:56:51,762 --> 01:56:54,932
This is nothing but a mild sedative
to calm you down.

2073
01:56:55,015 --> 01:56:57,392
You know I wouldn't
let any--

2074
01:56:57,476 --> 01:56:58,435
Ro.

2075
01:56:58,519 --> 01:56:59,436
Aah!

2076
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:00,938
Ro, Ro!

2077
01:57:01,021 --> 01:57:02,147
Help me!

2078
01:57:02,231 --> 01:57:03,148
Oh, Ro, baby.

2079
01:57:03,232 --> 01:57:06,193
Somebody help me!

2080
01:57:06,276 --> 01:57:07,277
Aah!

2081
01:57:16,620 --> 01:57:18,038
Wait a minute.

2082
01:57:18,956 --> 01:57:21,166
Wait a minute now.

2083
01:57:26,380 --> 01:57:28,215
We happen to be
in labor here.

2084
01:57:28,257 --> 01:57:29,216
Here?

2085
01:57:29,258 --> 01:57:29,800
Here.

2086
01:57:29,883 --> 01:57:30,968
You're all right, baby.

2087
01:57:31,051 --> 01:57:32,469
You're going to be
perfectly all right.

2088
01:57:32,553 --> 01:57:33,595
I swear to God you will.

2089
01:57:33,679 --> 01:57:36,348
There were supposed
to be doctors, hospitals!

2090
01:57:36,390 --> 01:57:37,349
Doctors, hospitals!

2091
01:57:38,517 --> 01:57:41,854
Everything--
Everything's clean and sterile!

2092
01:57:43,480 --> 01:57:44,481
No, she isn't here, Elise.

2093
01:57:44,565 --> 01:57:46,525
I'll have her
call you back.

2094
01:57:52,322 --> 01:57:53,782
Oh, Andy...

2095
01:57:53,866 --> 01:57:56,493
Andy or Jenny...

2096
01:57:56,577 --> 01:58:00,539
I--I'm sorry,
my little darling.

2097
01:58:00,622 --> 01:58:02,249
Forgive me.

2098
01:58:13,343 --> 01:58:14,803
Hi.

2099
01:58:19,975 --> 01:58:21,101
Hi.

2100
01:58:23,103 --> 01:58:26,315
Is it all right?

2101
01:58:27,107 --> 01:58:30,611
Yes, it's fine.

2102
01:58:32,112 --> 01:58:34,489
What is it?

2103
01:58:34,573 --> 01:58:36,116
A boy.

2104
01:58:40,370 --> 01:58:43,207
Really?
A boy?

2105
01:58:52,549 --> 01:58:54,551
And it's all right?

2106
01:58:54,635 --> 01:58:56,303
Yes.

2107
01:59:15,906 --> 01:59:17,866
Where is it?

2108
01:59:17,950 --> 01:59:18,951
Ohh!

2109
01:59:19,034 --> 01:59:20,536
Oh, my goodness.

2110
01:59:20,577 --> 01:59:23,288
Oh, gee, what a start you gave me.
My goodness.

2111
01:59:23,330 --> 01:59:24,706
The baby, where is it?

2112
01:59:24,790 --> 01:59:28,293
Oh, uh, you wait
here one minute.

2113
01:59:30,420 --> 01:59:32,047
Where's my baby?

2114
01:59:32,130 --> 01:59:34,591
Uh, I'll go find Dr. Abe.

2115
01:59:34,633 --> 01:59:36,134
Ju-Just wait.

2116
01:59:52,609 --> 01:59:54,027
Where's the baby?

2117
01:59:57,614 --> 01:59:59,116
Where is it?

2118
01:59:59,157 --> 02:00:01,326
Honey...

2119
02:00:01,869 --> 02:00:03,203
There were complications,
Rosemary,

2120
02:00:03,245 --> 02:00:05,163
but nothing that will affect
future births.

2121
02:00:08,584 --> 02:00:10,294
It's...

2122
02:00:11,670 --> 02:00:12,796
Dead.

2123
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:14,298
It was in
the wrong position.

2124
02:00:14,381 --> 02:00:15,799
In the hospital
I might have been able

2125
02:00:15,883 --> 02:00:17,426
to do something about it,
but you wouldn't listen.

2126
02:00:17,509 --> 02:00:20,470
Honey, we can have others
as soon as you're better. I promise you.

2127
02:00:20,554 --> 02:00:23,140
Absolutely. You can start on another
in a very few months.

2128
02:00:23,223 --> 02:00:24,558
As soon as
you're better.

2129
02:00:24,600 --> 02:00:25,767
No.

2130
02:00:27,477 --> 02:00:29,938
I don't believe you.
You're both lying.

2131
02:00:30,022 --> 02:00:32,024
You're lying!
It didn't die!

2132
02:00:32,065 --> 02:00:33,150
You took it!

2133
02:00:33,233 --> 02:00:34,484
You're lying!

2134
02:00:34,568 --> 02:00:36,195
You're witches!

2135
02:00:36,278 --> 02:00:37,279
You're lying!

2136
02:00:37,362 --> 02:00:38,822
You're lying!

2137
02:00:38,906 --> 02:00:40,824
You're lying!

2138
02:00:40,908 --> 02:00:42,576
You're lying!

2139
02:00:51,251 --> 02:00:54,755
Abe says it's called
pre-partum.

2140
02:00:54,838 --> 02:00:57,716
I don't know.
It's some kind of a hysteria.

2141
02:00:58,675 --> 02:01:02,596
Boy, you were really kapow,
out of your mind.

2142
02:01:05,015 --> 02:01:10,312
Uh, I know where you got the idea
that Minnie and Roman were witches,

2143
02:01:10,938 --> 02:01:16,068
but, um, how come you thought
that Abe and I joined the party?

2144
02:01:18,904 --> 02:01:21,030
Um, let's face it, darling.

2145
02:01:21,031 --> 02:01:25,369
You had the pre-partum crazies.

2146
02:01:25,911 --> 02:01:30,290
Now you're going to rest,
and you're going to get over them.

2147
02:01:30,374 --> 02:01:34,044
I know this is the worst thing
that ever happened to you,

2148
02:01:34,127 --> 02:01:36,463
but from now on,
everything's going to be roses.

2149
02:01:36,547 --> 02:01:38,507
Paramount's within an inch
of where we want them,

2150
02:01:38,549 --> 02:01:40,801
and suddenly Universa"s
interested, too,

2151
02:01:40,884 --> 02:01:42,135
and we're going
to blow this town,

2152
02:01:42,219 --> 02:01:44,346
and we're going to be
in the beautiful Hills of Beverly

2153
02:01:44,429 --> 02:01:47,850
with a pool, a spice garden,
the whole schmeer,

2154
02:01:47,891 --> 02:01:49,560
and the kids, too, Ro.

2155
02:01:49,643 --> 02:01:52,563
Scout's honor.
You heard what Abe said.

2156
02:01:56,400 --> 02:01:59,278
Now, I got to run now
and get famous.

2157
02:02:02,114 --> 02:02:04,575
Let me see your shoulder.

2158
02:02:07,494 --> 02:02:09,329
Let me see your shoulder.

2159
02:02:09,413 --> 02:02:10,414
Are you kidding?

2160
02:02:10,497 --> 02:02:13,292
Your left shoulder.

2161
02:02:13,375 --> 02:02:15,752
All right.
Anything you say.

2162
02:02:18,797 --> 02:02:22,134
I generally prefer
doing this to music.

2163
02:02:22,217 --> 02:02:23,719
Left shoulder.

2164
02:02:26,763 --> 02:02:27,848
Right shoulder.

2165
02:02:31,143 --> 02:02:35,063
And that's as far as I go
without a blue light.

2166
02:02:39,067 --> 02:02:40,944
The high pressure area
that we see here

2167
02:02:41,028 --> 02:02:43,405
has been causing this
extreme heat and humidity.

2168
02:02:44,031 --> 02:02:46,658
And unfortunately
will be staying with us city dwellers

2169
02:02:46,742 --> 02:02:48,285
through the rest of the week.

2170
02:02:48,368 --> 02:02:51,496
It will be hot and over cast
upstate New York as well

2171
02:02:51,580 --> 02:02:55,000
with the possibility of thunder showers
tonight and tomorrow

2172
02:02:55,083 --> 02:02:57,544
withg radual clearing
by tomorrow night.

2173
02:02:57,586 --> 02:03:02,049
All you people leaving the city this
upcoming weekend should find it hot.

2174
02:03:26,073 --> 02:03:29,618
Do you hear a baby crying?

2175
02:03:29,701 --> 02:03:32,162
Why, no, I don't, dear.

2176
02:03:32,246 --> 02:03:34,039
Now, you come
and get into your bed now.

2177
02:03:34,081 --> 02:03:37,000
It's time for you
to take your pill.

2178
02:03:46,260 --> 02:03:48,220
Did you turn the air
conditioner off?

2179
02:03:48,262 --> 02:03:49,054
Mm-hmm.

2180
02:03:49,096 --> 02:03:51,139
Well, you mustn't do that, dear.

2181
02:03:51,223 --> 02:03:54,184
Why, people are actually dying,
it's so hot.

2182
02:04:09,324 --> 02:04:11,034
What do you do
with the milk?

2183
02:04:11,535 --> 02:04:14,329
Why, uh,
throw it away.

2184
02:04:14,413 --> 02:04:16,081
Your pill, Rosemary.

2185
02:04:25,465 --> 02:04:26,800
Hello, girls.

2186
02:04:26,884 --> 02:04:30,387
Whew. 95 out.

2187
02:04:30,470 --> 02:04:33,765
Some new people
moved on in up in 8.

2188
02:04:33,849 --> 02:04:36,185
Do they have a baby?

2189
02:04:38,061 --> 02:04:39,438
How'd you know that?

2190
02:04:39,521 --> 02:04:42,566
I heard it crying.

2191
02:04:43,901 --> 02:04:45,360
Oh, wait a minute.

2192
02:04:48,780 --> 02:04:51,575
Oh, no.
Don't do that.

2193
02:04:51,658 --> 02:04:53,202
Why not?

2194
02:04:53,285 --> 02:04:56,747
Uh, a little messy, that's all.

2195
02:07:46,667 --> 02:07:48,627
Easy, easy.

2196
02:08:05,727 --> 02:08:08,522
Got her too high.

2197
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:31,295
Not if he's still waiting
for a plane, he isn't.

2198
02:08:33,964 --> 02:08:35,716
Oh, hell, now, Hayato.

2199
02:08:35,799 --> 02:08:37,092
You're just
making fun of me.

2200
02:08:37,134 --> 02:08:39,803
You're pulling my leg,
like we say.

2201
02:09:04,953 --> 02:09:08,081
Aah!

2202
02:09:08,790 --> 02:09:11,043
Rosemary,
go back to bed.

2203
02:09:11,168 --> 02:09:13,545
You know you're not supposed
to be up and around.

2204
02:09:13,587 --> 02:09:14,546
Is the mother?

2205
02:09:14,630 --> 02:09:15,756
Uh, Rosemary--

2206
02:09:15,797 --> 02:09:19,259
Shut up. You're in Dubrovnik.
I don't hear you.

2207
02:10:04,137 --> 02:10:06,807
What have you
done to it?

2208
02:10:06,849 --> 02:10:08,976
What have you done
to its eyes?

2209
02:10:09,059 --> 02:10:10,561
He has his
father's eyes.

2210
02:10:15,899 --> 02:10:19,528
What are you talking about?
Guy's eyes are normal.

2211
02:10:19,570 --> 02:10:22,698
What have you done to him,
you maniacs?

2212
02:10:22,739 --> 02:10:25,200
Satan is his father,
not Guy.

2213
02:10:25,951 --> 02:10:29,580
He came up from hell and begat a son
of mortal woman.

2214
02:10:29,621 --> 02:10:30,539
Hail, Satan.

2215
02:10:30,622 --> 02:10:31,623
Hail, Satan.

2216
02:10:31,707 --> 02:10:35,127
Satan is his father,
and his name is Adrian.

2217
02:10:35,210 --> 02:10:38,463
He shall overthrow the mighty
and lay waste their temples.

2218
02:10:38,547 --> 02:10:41,884
He shall redeem the despised
and wreak vengeance

2219
02:10:41,967 --> 02:10:45,429
in the name of the burned
and the tortured!

2220
02:10:45,470 --> 02:10:46,430
Hail, Adrian!

2221
02:10:46,471 --> 02:10:47,431
Hail, Adrian!

2222
02:10:47,472 --> 02:10:49,558
Hail, Satan!
Hail, Satan!

2223
02:10:49,641 --> 02:10:51,310
Hail, Satan!

2224
02:10:51,393 --> 02:10:53,228
He chose you
out of all the world.

2225
02:10:53,312 --> 02:10:55,731
Out of all the women
in the whole world, he chose you.

2226
02:10:55,814 --> 02:10:57,524
He arranged things
because he wanted you

2227
02:10:57,608 --> 02:10:59,026
to be the mother
of his only living son.

2228
02:10:59,109 --> 02:11:01,445
His power is stronger
than stronger!

2229
02:11:01,486 --> 02:11:04,239
His might shall last
longer than longer!

2230
02:11:04,323 --> 02:11:06,158
Hail, Satan!

2231
02:11:06,700 --> 02:11:08,452
No!

2232
02:11:08,493 --> 02:11:11,288
It can't be!

2233
02:11:11,371 --> 02:11:13,165
No!

2234
02:11:13,248 --> 02:11:14,666
Go look at his hands.

2235
02:11:14,750 --> 02:11:16,126
And his feet.

2236
02:11:18,128 --> 02:11:20,506
Oh, God!

2237
02:11:21,590 --> 02:11:23,467
God is dead!

2238
02:11:23,509 --> 02:11:24,843
Satan lives!

2239
02:11:24,927 --> 02:11:26,720
The year is one!

2240
02:11:26,762 --> 02:11:27,971
- Hail, Satan!
- Hail, Satan!

2241
02:11:28,055 --> 02:11:29,765
The year is one,
and God is done!

2242
02:11:29,848 --> 02:11:30,933
Oh, God!

2243
02:11:31,016 --> 02:11:32,559
The year is one!

2244
02:11:32,601 --> 02:11:35,312
Hail, Adrian!

2245
02:11:35,395 --> 02:11:37,856
Hail, Satan!

2246
02:11:38,232 --> 02:11:40,108
Why don't you help us out,
Rosemary?

2247
02:11:41,235 --> 02:11:42,735
Be a real mother to Adrian.

2248
02:11:42,736 --> 02:11:44,863
You don't have to join
If you don't want to.

2249
02:11:44,905 --> 02:11:48,075
Just be a mother
to your baby.

2250
02:11:48,909 --> 02:11:52,496
Minnie and Laura-Louise
are too old.

2251
02:11:52,579 --> 02:11:54,122
It's not right.

2252
02:11:56,250 --> 02:11:58,043
Think about it, Rosemary.

2253
02:12:11,765 --> 02:12:13,308
Oh, God!

2254
02:12:13,392 --> 02:12:14,768
Oh, shut up with your oh, Gods,

2255
02:12:14,810 --> 02:12:16,228
or we'll kill you,
milk or no milk.

2256
02:12:16,270 --> 02:12:17,396
You shut up.

2257
02:12:17,479 --> 02:12:21,483
Rosemary's his mother,
so you show some respect.

2258
02:12:22,776 --> 02:12:24,194
Come, my friend.

2259
02:12:24,278 --> 02:12:27,030
Come see him.
Come see the child.

2260
02:12:37,165 --> 02:12:40,252
What would you
like to drink?

2261
02:12:40,294 --> 02:12:42,796
They, uh, promised
me you wouldn't be hurt,

2262
02:12:42,838 --> 02:12:45,507
and you haven't
been, really.

2263
02:12:46,717 --> 02:12:50,971
I mean, supposing you had the baby
and you lost it.

2264
02:12:51,054 --> 02:12:53,015
Wouldn't that
be the same?

2265
02:12:53,056 --> 02:12:56,143
And we're getting so much
in return, Ro.

2266
02:13:06,486 --> 02:13:10,991
Oh, Guy, let me introduce
you to Argyron Stavropoulos.

2267
02:13:11,033 --> 02:13:13,619
How proud you must be.

2268
02:13:13,702 --> 02:13:15,162
Is this the mother?

2269
02:13:15,204 --> 02:13:16,371
Why in the name of--

2270
02:13:16,413 --> 02:13:18,457
Here, drink this.
You'll feel a little better.

2271
02:13:18,540 --> 02:13:20,000
What's in it?
Tannis root?

2272
02:13:20,083 --> 02:13:21,001
Nothing's in it.

2273
02:13:21,084 --> 02:13:22,794
Just plain,
ordinary Lipton's tea.

2274
02:13:22,878 --> 02:13:24,296
You drink it.

2275
02:13:55,577 --> 02:13:57,037
Get away from here.

2276
02:13:57,120 --> 02:13:58,288
Roman.

2277
02:13:58,372 --> 02:14:00,374
You're rocking him too fast.

2278
02:14:00,457 --> 02:14:02,251
Sit down.
Get her out of here.

2279
02:14:02,292 --> 02:14:03,544
Put her where she belongs.

2280
02:14:03,627 --> 02:14:05,170
You're rocking him too fast.

2281
02:14:05,254 --> 02:14:06,296
That's why he's crying.

2282
02:14:06,380 --> 02:14:07,214
Oh, mind your own business.

2283
02:14:07,256 --> 02:14:08,549
Let Rosemary rock him.

2284
02:14:09,591 --> 02:14:12,177
Go on, sit down with the others.
Let Rosemary rock him.

2285
02:14:12,219 --> 02:14:13,262
Well, she's liable to--

2286
02:14:13,345 --> 02:14:16,265
Sit down with the others,
Laura-Louise.

2287
02:14:25,315 --> 02:14:26,817
Rock him.

2288
02:14:29,570 --> 02:14:32,865
You're trying to get me
to be his mother.

2289
02:14:32,948 --> 02:14:34,950
Aren't you his mother?

2290
02:16:42,786 --> 02:16:42,953
END
