<i>[Episode 18]</i>

2
00:00:28,347 --> 00:00:31,115
No... Tae Ha...

3
00:00:31,254 --> 00:00:32,576
No!

4
00:00:42,704 --> 00:00:46,214
What are you doing not taking care
of the Prosecutor first, punk?

5
00:00:49,444 --> 00:00:51,204
Yeo Gyeong...

6
00:00:53,434 --> 00:00:57,784
Go to the hospital first.
I'll go after I wrap up here.

7
00:01:15,064 --> 00:01:19,493
Doggoo, you a**hole...
how is that you're here?

8
00:01:19,494 --> 00:01:23,843
Pil Seung... did you get a fake eye?

9
00:01:23,844 --> 00:01:27,344
How did you see to it that you think
it was okay to mess with a prosecutor?

10
00:01:29,384 --> 00:01:32,133
Listen to me carefully.

11
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:35,813
Don't ask nor try to figure it out.
Just disappear.

12
00:01:35,814 --> 00:01:39,873
Whatever the Noodle Master says
to you, you shouldn't come out.

13
00:01:39,874 --> 00:01:45,043
If you show your face, I'll kill you.
Got it?

14
00:01:45,044 --> 00:01:51,314
If I don't find work, I'll
starve to death all the same.

15
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:03,303
Tens of gold badges (Assemblymen)
are tangled in this and

16
00:02:03,304 --> 00:02:06,423
a Prosecutors' Office Special
Investigative Team is twisted in it.

17
00:02:06,424 --> 00:02:10,823
If you get involved thinking, "Something's
gotta give," then you'll be shredded to death.

18
00:02:10,824 --> 00:02:14,413
Eat this money and get
your feet out of it, okay?

19
00:02:14,414 --> 00:02:19,584
You can't even handle me alone. Understand?

20
00:02:29,224 --> 00:02:30,994
Come in.

21
00:02:39,984 --> 00:02:41,714
Sit down.

22
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:48,973
I'll tell you the reason I called you here.

23
00:02:48,974 --> 00:02:54,103
Noodle Maker Kim Da Hae is especially
generous to you, Noodle Chef.

24
00:02:54,104 --> 00:02:57,303
Is there another reason
why you approached her?

25
00:02:57,304 --> 00:02:58,953
What are you saying?

26
00:02:58,954 --> 00:03:05,573
TV appearance issue and also the
noodle master position issue...

27
00:03:05,574 --> 00:03:10,784
I believe you're behind
it all, Noodle Chef.

28
00:03:11,934 --> 00:03:15,023
Are you showing concern as an adviser?

29
00:03:15,024 --> 00:03:18,844
Or are you concerned as her father?

30
00:03:20,124 --> 00:03:22,043
You knew?

31
00:03:22,044 --> 00:03:27,533
It's an open secret. Everyone
knows, but pretends not to know.

32
00:03:27,534 --> 00:03:32,843
Don't influence Da Hae. Distance
yourself and don't get close to her.

33
00:03:32,844 --> 00:03:36,643
If you're saying that as an
adviser, I can't do that.

34
00:03:36,644 --> 00:03:42,963
Noodle Maker Kim Da Hae has the talent to lead Goong
Rak Won. I'll stay close to her and help her.

35
00:03:42,964 --> 00:03:46,583
If you're saying this as her
father, I can't do that either.

36
00:03:46,584 --> 00:03:49,514
Adviser, you don't have the right.

37
00:03:50,574 --> 00:03:55,304
Listen to me. Don't make this any bigger.

38
00:03:56,204 --> 00:04:01,863
Now, I'll tell you the reason I came here.
Vacate your office.

39
00:04:01,864 --> 00:04:05,933
This office... There's no reason for a
mere adviser to occupy this office.

40
00:04:05,934 --> 00:04:08,703
I'll give you three days,
so wrap things up here.

41
00:04:08,704 --> 00:04:13,203
Also, please don't come in
and out of the kitchen.

42
00:04:13,204 --> 00:04:18,173
I won't accept the kitchen being
used for your political ambition.

43
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:23,394
You act as though you've
got the whole world.

44
00:04:24,714 --> 00:04:28,823
If Goong Rak Won is a small world,
you're not wrong in saying that.

45
00:04:28,824 --> 00:04:33,144
If I captured enemy territory,
I should reap the spoils.

46
00:04:35,534 --> 00:04:39,284
You're my spoils, Adviser.

47
00:05:02,044 --> 00:05:07,093
You said you had a name you had to
recover for your father's sake, right?

48
00:05:07,094 --> 00:05:09,953
I also have names I need to recover.

49
00:05:09,954 --> 00:05:14,953
When I recover those names, something
very interesting will happen.

50
00:05:14,954 --> 00:05:17,743
I don't need spoils.

51
00:05:17,744 --> 00:05:21,183
I'll destroy everything.

52
00:05:21,184 --> 00:05:23,384
Three days.

53
00:05:24,654 --> 00:05:26,914
Take everything.

54
00:05:27,824 --> 00:05:31,534
I'll throw whatever is left
away in the trash can.

55
00:06:00,524 --> 00:06:02,993
Why not sleep more?

56
00:06:02,994 --> 00:06:08,424
You didn't faint from the
injury, but from exhaustion.

57
00:06:13,094 --> 00:06:15,204
Everything's a mess.

58
00:06:16,804 --> 00:06:20,373
We were lucky. Both you and I.

59
00:06:20,374 --> 00:06:21,983
It's the Noodle Master, right?

60
00:06:21,984 --> 00:06:25,883
If he finds out they
failed, he'll try again.

61
00:06:25,884 --> 00:06:28,724
There's no guarantee you'll
be as lucky next time.

62
00:06:30,994 --> 00:06:34,903
I have you. Stop them again.

63
00:06:34,904 --> 00:06:37,023
Yeo Gyeong.

64
00:06:37,024 --> 00:06:42,023
I should show them what happens if they mess with a
prosecutor. They keep trying because I let it slide.

65
00:06:42,024 --> 00:06:44,184
I'll sweep them all away...

66
00:06:45,254 --> 00:06:47,254
Oh, so dizzy...

67
00:06:53,654 --> 00:06:57,314
Sleep some more. I'll say
until you fall asleep.

68
00:07:04,074 --> 00:07:06,564
<i>ID, Park Tae Ha.</i>

69
00:07:25,124 --> 00:07:27,784
Is the Prosecutor alright?

70
00:07:30,874 --> 00:07:33,073
How about you?

71
00:07:33,074 --> 00:07:34,333
Are you worried?

72
00:07:34,334 --> 00:07:37,603
You almost got a hole on your side.
Wouldn't I be worried?

73
00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:41,463
Everything is good with you except
your focus. How disappointing...

74
00:07:41,464 --> 00:07:46,364
Did the Noodle Master really
order my father to kill people?

75
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:51,783
That's right.

76
00:07:51,784 --> 00:07:55,263
I don't think he said it in so many words.

77
00:07:55,264 --> 00:07:58,423
But isn't going to the extent of giving drugs
to a drug addict and handing him a knife

78
00:07:58,424 --> 00:08:01,554
the same as ordering him to kill?

79
00:08:03,354 --> 00:08:08,563
Tae Ha, if you're not going to kill
the Noodle Master, come out of there.

80
00:08:08,564 --> 00:08:13,093
Noodle Master, that punk... he
ruins people by riling them up.

81
00:08:13,094 --> 00:08:21,094
You, too, will be used like your
father and will be abandoned.

82
00:08:22,994 --> 00:08:25,813
I can't leave yet.

83
00:08:25,814 --> 00:08:30,004
Why? Because of that cocky friend of yours?

84
00:08:31,184 --> 00:08:37,644
I came in because of my friends at first. But there's
someone else I need to protect besides my friend.

85
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,104
Please take good care of Yeo Gyeong.

86
00:09:06,234 --> 00:09:08,763
<i>Noodle Master</i>

87
00:09:08,764 --> 00:09:12,414
Hyungnim... let's get out
of this at this point.

88
00:09:31,734 --> 00:09:35,434
<i>Doggoo</i>

89
00:09:43,904 --> 00:09:44,574
Ha Jung Tae speaking.

90
00:09:44,575 --> 00:09:47,163
<i>Hey, Ha Jung Tae, how are you?</i>

91
00:09:47,164 --> 00:09:51,134
<i>Don't hang up, punk. I
have something to say.</i>

92
00:09:52,854 --> 00:09:54,923
From observing your behavior yesterday...

93
00:09:54,924 --> 00:09:57,343
you must be quite desperate, huh?

94
00:09:57,344 --> 00:09:58,933
Yesterday?

95
00:09:58,934 --> 00:10:03,273
Kang Gil Seung and his gang... they dug up a
hole and buried their heads like ostriches do.

96
00:10:03,274 --> 00:10:05,124
There's no use looking for them.

97
00:10:07,114 --> 00:10:09,273
This is my last warning.

98
00:10:09,274 --> 00:10:14,293
The reason I didn't kill you is because
I didn't want to make Da Hae an orphan.

99
00:10:14,294 --> 00:10:19,033
If you mess around again, I'll
go in to Goong Rak Won again.

100
00:10:19,034 --> 00:10:24,344
You're really dead then. Got it?

101
00:10:40,984 --> 00:10:43,204
What happened to your face?

102
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:47,134
I fell drunk.

103
00:10:47,894 --> 00:10:50,594
You drink without money?

104
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,474
See if you're missing anything.

105
00:11:08,274 --> 00:11:10,893
Thank you.

106
00:11:10,894 --> 00:11:12,774
Go.

107
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,173
What's going on?

108
00:11:45,174 --> 00:11:47,073
I think the Noodle Master
senses our relationship.

109
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:49,553
It's because you dropped our photo.

110
00:11:49,554 --> 00:11:52,713
No, you might have given
it to him yourself.

111
00:11:52,714 --> 00:11:56,043
Are you saying I sold you guys out?

112
00:11:56,044 --> 00:11:57,493
How did you see the photo?

113
00:11:57,494 --> 00:12:02,313
The Noodle Master showed it to me.
Right in front of my eyes.

114
00:12:02,314 --> 00:12:05,253
Why are you still by his side?

115
00:12:05,254 --> 00:12:10,464
I know the reason why you came. But the
reason for your staying here is inexplicable.

116
00:12:11,194 --> 00:12:13,883
Get out of here. That's the
only way I can trust you.

117
00:12:13,884 --> 00:12:16,843
When everything is over, I'll
leave on my own two feet.

118
00:12:16,844 --> 00:12:20,273
Whatever kind of revenge
you want, do it fast.

119
00:12:20,274 --> 00:12:23,903
The way I see it, you and Yeo
Gyeong are both in danger.

120
00:12:23,904 --> 00:12:29,034
Worry about yourself. I
can take care of myself.

121
00:12:30,164 --> 00:12:34,374
Don't be so sure. Yeo
Gyeong said the same thing.

122
00:12:36,254 --> 00:12:40,964
Go see Yeo Gyeong. Bye.

123
00:12:44,854 --> 00:12:46,924
<i>Hospital Room 203</i>

124
00:12:56,884 --> 00:12:58,973
Are you looking for someone?

125
00:12:58,974 --> 00:13:01,524
Chae Yeo Gyeong...

126
00:13:02,734 --> 00:13:06,594
Patient in room 203 was discharged.

127
00:13:08,674 --> 00:13:12,953
Shouldn't you stay in the
hospital for a few more days?

128
00:13:12,954 --> 00:13:16,793
I don't have that kind of time.
How about the thugs?

129
00:13:16,794 --> 00:13:19,154
Well...

130
00:13:20,984 --> 00:13:23,664
<i>Myeong</i>

131
00:13:48,204 --> 00:13:53,583
I told them off so they'd understand.
So, don't look for them.

132
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:57,113
Only sparks will fly if you mess
with the fire that's going out.

133
00:13:57,114 --> 00:13:59,243
Let the attackers who
attacked a prosecutor go?

134
00:13:59,244 --> 00:14:03,813
From the looks of it, I think they
were going to stop at kidnapping you.

135
00:14:03,814 --> 00:14:06,993
But if you corner them like crazy,

136
00:14:06,994 --> 00:14:09,453
they'll come carrying weapons next time.

137
00:14:09,454 --> 00:14:14,194
When their own lives are on the line,
who cares if you're a prosecutor?

138
00:14:16,534 --> 00:14:19,514
Focus on the Noodle Master.

139
00:14:27,384 --> 00:14:30,673
You sent in the witness
application, right, CEO Lee?

140
00:14:30,674 --> 00:14:34,774
He said he was ready to testify.
So, I sent it in.

141
00:14:35,934 --> 00:14:38,863
If you don't need it, we'll
just say it never happened.

142
00:14:38,864 --> 00:14:42,163
This... Can he testify for sure?

143
00:14:42,164 --> 00:14:45,953
A change of heart happens
so quickly in a person.

144
00:14:45,954 --> 00:14:51,553
I can't guarantee it. But
I think he'll do it.

145
00:14:51,554 --> 00:14:54,813
Keep it for me. I'll summon him soon.

146
00:14:54,814 --> 00:14:58,563
Wow, playing prosecutor is so fun.

147
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,794
What will you do now?

148
00:15:04,234 --> 00:15:06,464
Hyungnim...

149
00:15:07,714 --> 00:15:10,964
What's wrong? Looks like you
were eating stolen food.

150
00:15:11,884 --> 00:15:15,654
Oh, Prosecutor Ahn, what brings you here?

151
00:15:18,524 --> 00:15:20,793
I'm Prosecutor Chae Yeo Gyeong.

152
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:28,794
Ah... Prosecutor Chae. Had I known how beautiful you are,
I would've responded to your subpoena ten times over.

153
00:15:29,684 --> 00:15:35,563
In any case, looks like we'll be seeing each other quite a bit.
I couldn't connect the Noodle Master with Aide Park alone.

154
00:15:35,564 --> 00:15:39,923
I have to bring you into it in
order to arrest the Noodle Master.

155
00:15:39,924 --> 00:15:44,723
Are you speaking Russian?
Hey, you translate.

156
00:15:44,724 --> 00:15:46,853
Did you stick a log in your ear?

157
00:15:46,854 --> 00:15:50,603
Assemblyman. You can choose
one of the two options.

158
00:15:50,604 --> 00:15:54,513
First, I'll arrest you in violation of the tax
law and will wrap up the case by fining you.

159
00:15:54,514 --> 00:15:58,373
You'll hurt your image, but
you can keep your gold badge.

160
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:04,153
If you insist on being stubborn, I'll arrest you the
minute the Temporary National Assembly Session adjourns.

161
00:16:04,154 --> 00:16:08,013
Be ready to serve a minimum of three
years to a maximum of five years.

162
00:16:08,014 --> 00:16:12,553
How can you say such a cruel thing?
Is there any other way?

163
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,574
No, there isn't.

164
00:16:21,094 --> 00:16:23,883
Number one.

165
00:16:23,884 --> 00:16:25,613
I have a condition.

166
00:16:25,614 --> 00:16:32,124
Sell out Noodle Master Ha Jung Tae.
I'll pay you a lot for him.

167
00:16:37,474 --> 00:16:39,954
Let me think about it.

168
00:16:59,484 --> 00:17:01,354
Speak.

169
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:05,483
Prosecutor Chae Yeo Gyeong...

170
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:08,004
Yeah, I heard she came to work today.

171
00:17:09,924 --> 00:17:14,393
You'll have to suppress her.

172
00:17:14,394 --> 00:17:18,953
There's plenty reason for her dismissal, but
looks like they're blocking it internally.

173
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:22,233
You're the one who caused all the problems.

174
00:17:22,234 --> 00:17:27,194
Why are you whining to me for your
inability to take care of it?

175
00:17:29,294 --> 00:17:33,773
You joined me offering lots of
money to Goong Rak Foundation.

176
00:17:33,774 --> 00:17:38,323
I gave you more shares in the Foundation compared
to Goong Rak Won. I can't even ask for this favor?

177
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:41,634
If you're asking me a favor,
show me how much you care.

178
00:17:43,064 --> 00:17:46,033
You have cash stored away in
your personal deposit box.

179
00:17:46,034 --> 00:17:48,074
Assemblyman!

180
00:17:53,904 --> 00:17:55,874
I apologize.

181
00:17:57,474 --> 00:18:04,643
If I touch my customer's money, I'm dead.
You know this.

182
00:18:04,644 --> 00:18:08,983
That's why everyone wants to wear the
gold badge. If you put on a gold badge,

183
00:18:08,984 --> 00:18:14,154
it's not embezzlement if you touch that
money. It becomes investment for your work.

184
00:18:15,124 --> 00:18:19,993
For now, bring it to me and
let's talk next time we meet.

185
00:18:19,994 --> 00:18:25,283
Must you even eat my bone marrow?

186
00:18:25,284 --> 00:18:28,743
People who haven't tasted
meat only want meat.

187
00:18:28,744 --> 00:18:35,284
One must eat even the bone marrow to say
that you've tasted everything. Understand?

188
00:18:48,184 --> 00:18:51,423
Anyway, please clean this up first.
So dark. I hate to see this.

189
00:18:51,424 --> 00:18:54,153
What are you doing?

190
00:18:54,154 --> 00:18:57,233
You're here. Good timing.

191
00:18:57,234 --> 00:18:59,933
This sofa is too big for
our living quarters.

192
00:18:59,934 --> 00:19:04,823
What living quarters? Didn't
you say in three days?

193
00:19:04,824 --> 00:19:09,933
I changed my mind. Since it's come to this,
I wanted to take care of it quickly.

194
00:19:09,934 --> 00:19:12,243
I'm going to destroy the secret room.

195
00:19:12,244 --> 00:19:20,073
Oh, my goodness... Even putting a rotating door... You made
such a big deal. How odd. Are you filming a spy movie?

196
00:19:20,074 --> 00:19:24,333
The corporate credit card for the
Noodle Master will be discontinued.

197
00:19:24,334 --> 00:19:30,633
Also, what else... Oh, yeah...
I fired all your men.

198
00:19:30,634 --> 00:19:34,943
Ugly guys dressed in dark suits
don't look good around here.

199
00:19:34,944 --> 00:19:38,023
Also, what makes you think there's
a terror threat at Goong Rak Won?

200
00:19:38,024 --> 00:19:41,523
To hire more than ten security guards
and bodyguards? Don't you think so?

201
00:19:41,524 --> 00:19:43,953
You're having so much fun. So much fun.

202
00:19:43,954 --> 00:19:46,314
Does it look like it?

203
00:19:47,804 --> 00:19:52,133
What should I do? I shouldn't
be so transparent.

204
00:19:52,134 --> 00:19:55,293
Do you know how I feel?

205
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:59,353
I feel like I'm on cloud nine.

206
00:19:59,354 --> 00:20:02,013
It's so great, so great. Such an ecstasy.

207
00:20:02,014 --> 00:20:04,404
Keep floating on cloud nine.

208
00:20:05,274 --> 00:20:06,793
I'll make you fall from there.

209
00:20:06,794 --> 00:20:13,444
Oh, my gosh... Aigo... so scary. What should
I do? I'm so scared that I'm about to cry.

210
00:20:21,994 --> 00:20:23,724
Be careful.

211
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:30,484
That moron... he'll do anything
to get back what he lost.

212
00:20:40,794 --> 00:20:42,894
Go Gang Sook... she's a scary woman.

213
00:20:44,234 --> 00:20:48,693
She placed a mat for me to sleep on
in a spot where her father died.

214
00:20:48,694 --> 00:20:50,393
She wants me to have a
nightmare or something?

215
00:20:50,394 --> 00:20:53,044
Should I look for a place
for you to stay outside?

216
00:20:54,234 --> 00:20:56,694
That's what Go Gang Sook wants.

217
00:20:57,894 --> 00:21:02,184
If I leave here, I'll never be
able to get back to Goong Rak Won.

218
00:21:03,524 --> 00:21:05,433
- Secretary Park.
- Yes, Noodle Master.

219
00:21:05,434 --> 00:21:09,753
Does it look like I'm
finished to you as well?

220
00:21:09,754 --> 00:21:12,324
I do see that circumstances aren't good.

221
00:21:13,454 --> 00:21:15,703
It will change soon.

222
00:21:15,704 --> 00:21:21,124
After I'm nominated and become a Assemblyman,
I'll put everything back the way it was.

223
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,493
The person who smiles
the widest right now...

224
00:21:25,494 --> 00:21:30,194
will be the one who'll cry the most then.

225
00:21:47,834 --> 00:21:50,743
<i>Why are you revealing this to me?</i>

226
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:57,414
<i>The palace pheasant buckwheat noodles. My father
perfected it, but Noodle Master stole it.</i>

227
00:22:10,504 --> 00:22:13,044
Is this about the Noodle Master?

228
00:22:16,704 --> 00:22:18,384
It's not like that.

229
00:22:19,754 --> 00:22:22,534
Come in. There's something
I want to say to you.

230
00:22:34,684 --> 00:22:36,294
I have a favor to ask you.

231
00:22:38,004 --> 00:22:39,914
Please oblige me.

232
00:22:41,004 --> 00:22:45,234
Noodle Master... so that he
can't do any more wrong...

233
00:22:46,344 --> 00:22:48,364
Please stop him.

234
00:22:51,984 --> 00:22:55,014
Stop getting hurt yourself.

235
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:59,324
Promise me. Hurry.

236
00:23:00,354 --> 00:23:04,524
Go to sleep. It's late.

237
00:24:45,204 --> 00:24:47,794
Please sign the release form.

238
00:24:57,044 --> 00:24:59,893
If you want, I can get you a bodyguard.

239
00:24:59,894 --> 00:25:01,774
I'm okay.

240
00:25:17,874 --> 00:25:19,764
Assemblyman.

241
00:25:23,334 --> 00:25:24,924
You're here.

242
00:26:00,764 --> 00:26:02,454
Put it away.

243
00:26:30,674 --> 00:26:33,034
And the classified document?

244
00:26:44,884 --> 00:26:48,464
<i>K120-17: Corruption in the National
Security and Defense Industry</i>

245
00:26:51,754 --> 00:26:57,034
- The original?
- The original... I'll give it to you after the nomination.

246
00:26:58,584 --> 00:27:01,494
That's a fair deal.

247
00:27:05,844 --> 00:27:07,634
What is it?

248
00:27:09,834 --> 00:27:13,363
Answer sheet to the candidate evaluation.

249
00:27:13,364 --> 00:27:17,393
It's the same as wearing a gold
badge starting today for you.

250
00:27:17,394 --> 00:27:21,273
Your district... Doesn't even
a corpse get elected there?

251
00:27:21,274 --> 00:27:26,673
- Review that and do well in your evaluation.
- I understand.

252
00:27:26,674 --> 00:27:32,424
And... until your
nomination is confirmed...

253
00:27:33,204 --> 00:27:38,773
just breathe. Nothing
else will be tolerated.

254
00:27:38,774 --> 00:27:45,644
If you do something like messing with Prosecutor
Chae like last time, you're finished.

255
00:27:47,494 --> 00:27:51,124
- I'll keep that in mind.
- You'll find out soon.

256
00:27:51,994 --> 00:27:58,514
You'll experience yourself why perfectly normal
people go crazy just to wear a gold badge.

257
00:28:23,044 --> 00:28:27,303
I only focus on the future of our nation...

258
00:28:27,304 --> 00:28:29,863
and happiness of our people...

259
00:28:29,864 --> 00:28:31,793
I'll solely focus...

260
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:36,754
Solely focus...

261
00:28:40,714 --> 00:28:47,193
An exiled king must live like this.
She made sure you can't go anywhere.

262
00:28:47,194 --> 00:28:50,543
I can go anywhere except for the kitchen.

263
00:28:50,544 --> 00:28:54,813
Do you know who you are if you can't
go into the Goong Rak Won kitchen?

264
00:28:54,814 --> 00:28:59,393
An outsider. You're being treated
like an outsider, Noodle Master.

265
00:28:59,394 --> 00:29:03,433
I just let her have it for the time being.
All I have to do is get it back.

266
00:29:03,434 --> 00:29:07,173
How? In what way?

267
00:29:07,174 --> 00:29:10,843
I listened to you and took my hands
off of Goong Rak Foundation.

268
00:29:10,844 --> 00:29:14,143
I'm shaky without any strings to hold
on to. Will you just stand and watch?

269
00:29:14,144 --> 00:29:19,763
The cruelest revenge is to bring misfortune when
she thinks she's reached the happiest moment.

270
00:29:19,764 --> 00:29:22,273
Tell her to be happy to
her heart's content.

271
00:29:22,274 --> 00:29:24,623
She doesn't have many days
left until she's miserable.

272
00:29:24,624 --> 00:29:28,024
Give me Goong Rak Won
shares as you promised.

273
00:29:29,644 --> 00:29:33,423
I should at least hold on
to that to feel as ease.

274
00:29:33,424 --> 00:29:37,873
I told you. My nomination comes
first and shares comes after that.

275
00:29:37,874 --> 00:29:40,183
Noodle Master!

276
00:29:40,184 --> 00:29:41,963
Don't be confrontational with me.

277
00:29:41,964 --> 00:29:45,623
What will you do if even I
turn my back on you? Wait.

278
00:29:45,624 --> 00:29:50,814
I never break a promise I made.

279
00:29:52,584 --> 00:29:57,094
Do you know who Prime
Noodle Chef Moo Myeong is?

280
00:30:07,144 --> 00:30:10,353
He's the bastard who ruined the banquet.

281
00:30:10,354 --> 00:30:14,093
<i>I found him. The bastard
who ruined the banquet...</i>

282
00:30:14,094 --> 00:30:19,504
<i>I mean, Choi Soon Seok. I found him.</i>

283
00:30:26,774 --> 00:30:28,353
Choi Soon Seok.

284
00:30:28,354 --> 00:30:32,673
He came into Goong Rak Won
targeting you from the get-go.

285
00:30:32,674 --> 00:30:39,303
To revenge his father's death, he hid
a knife with him. That's Moo Myeong.

286
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:42,703
His medical records from the time he
was stabbed by Secretary Hwang...

287
00:30:42,704 --> 00:30:47,114
The banquet guest list he stashed away...
It's all in there.

288
00:30:49,664 --> 00:30:52,724
<i>Invitation List</i>

289
00:30:56,314 --> 00:31:00,843
But how do you know about this, Madam Seol?

290
00:31:00,844 --> 00:31:05,173
I held Moo Myeong's hand and...

291
00:31:05,174 --> 00:31:08,003
was going to chew you out, Noodle Master.

292
00:31:08,004 --> 00:31:10,644
We were accomplices.

293
00:31:40,214 --> 00:31:44,723
Are you Choi Soon Seok?

294
00:31:44,724 --> 00:31:50,354
Not Moo Myeong. Ha Jung
Tae's son, Choi Soon Seok.

295
00:31:54,984 --> 00:31:58,014
You're Kim Gil Do.

296
00:31:58,934 --> 00:32:04,033
Gangnam San 323-37.

297
00:32:04,034 --> 00:32:09,173
Right here. The spot where you're
standing is where you were born.

298
00:32:09,174 --> 00:32:12,713
Seongbukdong 387-18.

299
00:32:12,714 --> 00:32:16,853
So Tae Seop's house where you
committed your first murder.

300
00:32:16,854 --> 00:32:23,883
And Gangwondo Bongpyeong Yupori 802-2.

301
00:32:23,884 --> 00:32:28,243
You killed my father and even my mother...

302
00:32:28,244 --> 00:32:34,983
And that wasn't enough. You stole my
father's name and life altogether there.

303
00:32:34,984 --> 00:32:42,363
And again here! This is where Choi Soon
Seok took away everything Kim Gil Go had.

304
00:32:42,364 --> 00:32:44,653
At a place where you were born!

305
00:32:44,654 --> 00:32:46,114
Shut up!

306
00:32:48,764 --> 00:32:52,983
If I was going to kill you, I could've
done it a hundred times over!

307
00:32:52,984 --> 00:32:55,413
Do you know why I let
you live all this time?

308
00:32:55,414 --> 00:32:58,483
To take away everything you've got.

309
00:32:58,484 --> 00:33:03,334
Ha Jung Tae... bore a monster.

310
00:33:05,354 --> 00:33:07,843
It's not over yet.

311
00:33:07,844 --> 00:33:12,743
There's one more thing I'll take away.
So, anticipate.

312
00:33:12,744 --> 00:33:18,784
The thing you'd never want to lose!
I'll take it away ruthlessly.

313
00:33:39,414 --> 00:33:41,963
Jung Tae...

314
00:33:41,964 --> 00:33:47,244
Look at your kid. To kill me...

315
00:33:47,924 --> 00:33:51,324
he appeared in front of me
as someone just like me.

316
00:34:18,534 --> 00:34:20,704
Ha Jung Tae...

317
00:34:21,874 --> 00:34:24,454
Wait a little longer.

318
00:34:25,524 --> 00:34:31,394
I'll send your son to your side.

319
00:34:44,094 --> 00:34:48,853
Oh, my gosh! This is so nice!

320
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:51,524
We can even record our show here.

321
00:34:54,844 --> 00:34:57,543
Why did you want me to come?

322
00:34:57,544 --> 00:35:00,714
I'm sure it's not to show
off your restaurant.

323
00:35:04,974 --> 00:35:06,683
Go live?

324
00:35:06,684 --> 00:35:10,233
Yes, the viewers can participate and...

325
00:35:10,234 --> 00:35:13,254
Moreover, it's something new.

326
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:17,703
It is, but as a cooking show...

327
00:35:17,704 --> 00:35:20,243
It takes too long to cook and...

328
00:35:20,244 --> 00:35:23,074
there exists variables.

329
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:28,754
Is Senator So Tae Seop well?

330
00:35:31,974 --> 00:35:32,964
Yes.

331
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:35,813
He mentioned you at times, Hyeon Jeong.

332
00:35:35,814 --> 00:35:39,674
Come by our Chi Meon Restaurant
with the Senator some time.

333
00:35:44,594 --> 00:35:48,904
It would be nice to have
Adviser Ha Jung Tae as well.

334
00:35:55,314 --> 00:35:59,343
Sure, I'll work on it.

335
00:35:59,344 --> 00:36:03,223
While we're at it, let's make it big.

336
00:36:03,224 --> 00:36:07,654
You must make sure Adviser Ha
Jung Tae appears on the show.

337
00:36:10,694 --> 00:36:14,903
And this production didn't come from me.

338
00:36:14,904 --> 00:36:17,794
You started it, Hyeon Jeong.

339
00:36:19,484 --> 00:36:23,554
Do you understand what I mean?

340
00:36:24,394 --> 00:36:26,673
I'm not a child.

341
00:36:26,674 --> 00:36:31,293
You have to keep your secret,
too, Prime Noodle Chef.

342
00:36:31,294 --> 00:36:33,904
That's the only way things will proceed.

343
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,073
Hasn't he gone crazy yet?

344
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:44,794
It must be hard to endure
with a clear head.

345
00:36:45,394 --> 00:36:50,033
Adviser Ha? Why do you ask me that?

346
00:36:50,034 --> 00:36:53,134
Aren't you guys buddies
these days, Madam Seol?

347
00:36:54,124 --> 00:36:58,363
I heard you two go around stuck
to each other. Isn't that true?

348
00:36:58,364 --> 00:36:59,963
What nonsense you speak!

349
00:36:59,964 --> 00:37:04,484
I plan to promote Prime
Noodle Chef to Noodle Master.

350
00:37:07,884 --> 00:37:10,944
It hasn't been long since
he became an heir.

351
00:37:12,094 --> 00:37:15,933
The Noodle Chef position has
been vacant for three years.

352
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:17,513
You must be more serious about
the Noodle Master position.

353
00:37:17,514 --> 00:37:20,533
If I leave the noodle
master position vacant,

354
00:37:20,534 --> 00:37:24,174
I don't know when Ha Jung Tae that
moron would come running for it.

355
00:37:24,924 --> 00:37:27,643
Since I've closed the casket,
I'm trying to hammer it shut.

356
00:37:27,644 --> 00:37:31,273
The Prime Noodle Chef can't
become the Noodle Master.

357
00:37:31,274 --> 00:37:35,123
Why not? Are you starting to hurt
seeing me doing whatever I want to?

358
00:37:35,124 --> 00:37:39,123
Prime Noodle Chef... he's
doesn't have sense of taste.

359
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:41,804
He lost his sense of taste.

360
00:37:41,874 --> 00:37:46,274
How can he be Noodle Master when he
can't taste anything? Don't you agree?

361
00:37:46,474 --> 00:37:47,174
Is that true?

362
00:37:47,194 --> 00:37:50,663
Why would I lie over something
that can be easily found out?

363
00:37:50,664 --> 00:37:54,473
If the Clan finds out, his place
as the heir is in jeopardy.

364
00:37:54,474 --> 00:37:57,414
So, stop acting in vain.

365
00:37:59,584 --> 00:38:05,003
He's like Beethoven. He's really amazing.
Don't you think so?

366
00:38:05,004 --> 00:38:09,764
Without sense of taste, could
he make such delicious noodles?

367
00:38:11,644 --> 00:38:12,963
Isn't he just like Beethoven?

368
00:38:12,964 --> 00:38:15,113
Madam Go!

369
00:38:15,114 --> 00:38:18,984
Madam Seol, listen up, okay?

370
00:38:19,754 --> 00:38:23,713
If your string got cut off, just stay put.

371
00:38:23,714 --> 00:38:28,483
Don't go around causing ruckus
with your mere 10% shares.

372
00:38:28,484 --> 00:38:30,733
Goong Rak Won is mine!

373
00:38:30,734 --> 00:38:32,443
Don't you understand?

374
00:38:32,444 --> 00:38:35,763
If you don't understand, just memorize it.

375
00:38:35,764 --> 00:38:38,084
Memorize!

376
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:42,053
Please put it on this end.

377
00:38:42,054 --> 00:38:43,613
Right here.

378
00:38:43,614 --> 00:38:45,814
Watch out for the floor.

379
00:39:40,094 --> 00:39:45,394
<i>Father, it's where Kim Gil
Do's desk used to be.</i>

380
00:39:46,614 --> 00:39:49,784
<i>He signed your name here.</i>

381
00:39:50,634 --> 00:39:52,854
<i>I took it from him.</i>

382
00:39:53,784 --> 00:39:56,714
<i>It's where Kim Gil Do's glory used to be.</i>

383
00:39:57,504 --> 00:40:00,864
<i>He obtained it through your
name and your secret recipe.</i>

384
00:40:02,294 --> 00:40:04,774
<i>I got rid of it all.</i>

385
00:40:05,824 --> 00:40:06,824
<i>And this is...</i>

386
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:11,504
<i>where he was born and grew up.</i>

387
00:40:12,914 --> 00:40:16,914
<i>I'll destroy it completely, so that
he can't even dream of coming back.</i>

388
00:40:18,234 --> 00:40:21,073
<i>Wait a little longer.</i>

389
00:40:21,074 --> 00:40:23,474
<i>Just a little longer.</i>

390
00:40:24,994 --> 00:40:29,273
<i>It's not a legal matter. It's a matter of
enforcement. As far as enforcement is concerned...</i>

391
00:40:29,274 --> 00:40:32,103
<i>With issues like these...</i>

392
00:40:32,104 --> 00:40:36,983
<i>Steal, change, imitate.</i>

393
00:40:36,984 --> 00:40:40,253
<i>I don't have to work at
creating an original.</i>

394
00:40:40,254 --> 00:40:45,394
<i>I can just steal, change, and imitate.</i>

395
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,824
Did they change my car, too?

396
00:40:59,264 --> 00:41:00,684
Forget it.

397
00:41:09,864 --> 00:41:12,433
Is today the candidate evaluation for
the Special Election nomination?

398
00:41:12,434 --> 00:41:13,823
Yes, Prosecutor.

399
00:41:13,824 --> 00:41:15,633
Some reporters must've shown up.

400
00:41:15,634 --> 00:41:18,093
Probably quite a few.

401
00:41:18,094 --> 00:41:20,274
Do you want to go look?

402
00:41:24,814 --> 00:41:26,684
Candidate Ha Jung Tae.

403
00:41:49,374 --> 00:41:52,803
I'm nomination candidate Ha Jung Tae.

404
00:41:52,804 --> 00:41:56,073
The great noodle master of Goong Rak Won...

405
00:41:56,074 --> 00:41:58,593
You must be a little nervous.

406
00:41:58,594 --> 00:42:03,743
There's no one who hasn't had a bowl of noodles
at Goong Rak Won over the candidate evaluation.

407
00:42:03,744 --> 00:42:07,253
Think of how you served noodles. Relax.

408
00:42:07,254 --> 00:42:09,823
Thank you, Chairman.

409
00:42:09,824 --> 00:42:11,844
Shall we begin?

410
00:42:20,344 --> 00:42:23,884
Who'd call you a political
novice, Noodle Master?

411
00:42:24,794 --> 00:42:27,103
As if you've been in office
for about three terms...

412
00:42:27,104 --> 00:42:30,743
your easy confidence,
attitude of conviction...

413
00:42:30,744 --> 00:42:34,543
and persuasive communication skills...

414
00:42:34,544 --> 00:42:37,053
Also, down to earth speaking manner...

415
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,783
Most importantly, making
people feel comfortable.

416
00:42:39,784 --> 00:42:41,723
You're born with it.

417
00:42:41,724 --> 00:42:43,733
You're generous in your compliment.

418
00:42:43,734 --> 00:42:47,323
If you trust me and follow, there
will be good things down the road.

419
00:42:47,324 --> 00:42:51,434
I'll be trusting you.

420
00:42:57,754 --> 00:43:01,613
Long time no see, Senator
and Noodle Master.

421
00:43:01,614 --> 00:43:03,253
What's going on?

422
00:43:03,254 --> 00:43:07,824
I request you to accompany me in
regards to Congressman Choi's case.

423
00:43:09,154 --> 00:43:12,764
Why now of all times?

424
00:43:13,544 --> 00:43:17,193
Why here of all places?

425
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:22,463
We have reporters here and looks like you'd be watchful of
others since it's candidate evaluation day for the nomination.

426
00:43:22,464 --> 00:43:24,783
I believe I picked good timing.

427
00:43:24,784 --> 00:43:28,214
I deny your request to accompany you.

428
00:43:29,114 --> 00:43:31,673
It will become a little noisy.

429
00:43:31,674 --> 00:43:34,513
Go follow her... before it gets louder.

430
00:43:34,514 --> 00:43:36,093
<i>Noodle Master, what's this about?</i>

431
00:43:36,094 --> 00:43:37,783
<i>Prosecutor Chae, one word please!</i>

432
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:40,443
<i>- Will this affect the nomination?
- Will it matter?</i>

433
00:43:40,444 --> 00:43:42,923
<i>One word please!</i>

434
00:43:42,924 --> 00:43:45,443
<i>Please say one word! Please!</i>

435
00:43:45,444 --> 00:43:47,673
<i>There must be something.
Please say something.</i>

436
00:43:47,674 --> 00:43:50,814
<i>Will you keep your promise?</i>

437
00:43:58,024 --> 00:44:01,513
<i>Ha Jung Tae... how long has he
been in the interrogation room?</i>

438
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:03,684
<i>Going on seven hours.</i>

439
00:44:04,814 --> 00:44:06,953
Hold onto him a little longer.

440
00:44:06,954 --> 00:44:09,274
He's probably going crazy.

441
00:44:12,174 --> 00:44:16,803
We saw Senator So Tae Seop and he knows
we're trying to involve Congressman Choi.

442
00:44:16,804 --> 00:44:20,263
They're probably worried just about now.

443
00:44:20,264 --> 00:44:24,023
The answer is out there already. Wouldn't
they call when their meeting is over?

444
00:44:24,024 --> 00:44:29,054
If you testify, she'll let you
get away with paying a fine?

445
00:44:29,594 --> 00:44:33,893
That's what she says, but I can't trust
anyone at the Prosecutors' Office.

446
00:44:33,894 --> 00:44:36,693
Some give their hearts and even
let them slap their cheek...

447
00:44:36,694 --> 00:44:38,703
Men who got screwed over...

448
00:44:38,704 --> 00:44:40,843
can fill up a truck.

449
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:44,144
She said she'd dig up to the
end if you don't testify?

450
00:44:45,204 --> 00:44:49,173
So I was thinking... if the
Prosecutors' Office looks into it,

451
00:44:49,174 --> 00:44:52,063
wouldn't it eventually lead
to Goong Rak Foundation?

452
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:55,153
I'm afraid you might be
hassled if she continues.

453
00:44:55,154 --> 00:44:58,024
That shouldn't happen, seriously...

454
00:45:02,224 --> 00:45:04,523
So I was wondering...

455
00:45:04,524 --> 00:45:09,044
If the charges against me are dismissed,
wouldn't it both benefit me and you?

456
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:15,334
You go and testify.

457
00:45:17,784 --> 00:45:22,753
Don't let it affect Goong Rak
Foundation and stop at your level.

458
00:45:22,754 --> 00:45:25,484
Instead, sell out the Noodle Master.

459
00:45:27,314 --> 00:45:29,343
What happens to Noodle
Master's nomination then?

460
00:45:29,344 --> 00:45:33,754
I'm sure he put in everything he
had and bought the nomination.

461
00:45:34,614 --> 00:45:38,344
Did I ask him to put everything in?
He did it happily.

462
00:45:39,074 --> 00:45:42,224
Call the Special Investigative
Team and wrap it up.

463
00:45:43,144 --> 00:45:46,444
Live people should live
and dead should die.

464
00:45:53,994 --> 00:45:56,124
Yes, Congressman Choi.

465
00:45:57,624 --> 00:45:59,864
You made the right decision.

466
00:46:09,924 --> 00:46:12,424
You can go home.

467
00:46:25,214 --> 00:46:27,644
Did you get what you wanted?

468
00:46:28,654 --> 00:46:32,713
Somewhat. How about you, Noodle Master?

469
00:46:32,714 --> 00:46:35,494
Not even a scratch.

470
00:46:47,984 --> 00:46:49,734
Noodle Master.

471
00:46:51,514 --> 00:46:53,784
Congressman Choi is here to see you.

472
00:46:54,624 --> 00:46:56,414
Congressman Choi?

473
00:47:06,244 --> 00:47:10,363
The results of the candidate evaluation for the
Special Election will be announced today, right?

474
00:47:10,364 --> 00:47:11,553
Yes.

475
00:47:11,554 --> 00:47:13,123
You must be nervous.

476
00:47:13,124 --> 00:47:18,814
I remember the first time I walked into
the Chi Meon Restaurant 30 years ago.

477
00:47:19,604 --> 00:47:24,294
I barged in trusting the secret recipe to
the palace pheasant buckwheat noodles.

478
00:47:25,624 --> 00:47:29,573
That mophead became me today.

479
00:47:29,574 --> 00:47:34,553
How I would turn out in
30 years from now on...

480
00:47:34,554 --> 00:47:36,814
will be determined today.

481
00:47:38,164 --> 00:47:41,284
You ask if I'm nervous?

482
00:47:42,564 --> 00:47:46,143
Honestly, more than 30 years ago...

483
00:47:46,144 --> 00:47:48,284
I'm nervous today.

484
00:47:49,044 --> 00:47:51,744
I'm being summoned by the
Special Investigative Team.

485
00:47:52,614 --> 00:47:57,313
After meeting with the Special Investigative Team,
even the most powerful conglomerates or congressmen

486
00:47:57,314 --> 00:48:01,043
don't end well. That place was
set up to catch people like us.

487
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:04,694
Even Doggoo who accepted
money got his case dropped.

488
00:48:05,504 --> 00:48:08,804
They can't accuse you of
crime for losing money.

489
00:48:10,794 --> 00:48:12,704
Noodle Master.

490
00:48:16,074 --> 00:48:18,433
Don't blame me.

491
00:48:18,434 --> 00:48:19,733
What are you talking about?

492
00:48:19,734 --> 00:48:23,183
In life, things happen that
goes against how you feel.

493
00:48:23,184 --> 00:48:27,814
Well... It's not like things would
work out just because I want it to.

494
00:48:28,444 --> 00:48:31,434
Let's get together for some soju later on.

495
00:48:34,254 --> 00:48:36,724
Thank you for the noodles.

496
00:48:57,474 --> 00:49:03,274
<i>Breaking news: Korea's Freedom Party nominates Professor Lee Gun Shil.
Goong Rak Won's Noodle Master Ha Jung Tae unexpectedly denied nomination.</i>

497
00:49:03,894 --> 00:49:09,694
<i>Breaking news: Korea's Freedom Party nominates Professor Lee Gun Shil.
Goong Rak Won's Noodle Master Ha Jung Tae unexpectedly denied nomination.</i>

498
00:49:18,654 --> 00:49:22,233
I got rid of the indigestion
I had for ten years!

499
00:49:22,234 --> 00:49:23,403
I don't need Tums.

500
00:49:23,404 --> 00:49:27,303
I didn't think request to accompany
me would deny him the nomination.

501
00:49:27,304 --> 00:49:29,313
The splinter in my finger is

502
00:49:29,314 --> 00:49:32,823
much more painful than a sword
stabbing another person.

503
00:49:32,824 --> 00:49:36,213
What if they get screwed for
embracing the Noodle Master?

504
00:49:36,214 --> 00:49:39,594
This is why politics is scary.

505
00:49:40,284 --> 00:49:42,493
When is Congressman Choi being summoned?

506
00:49:42,494 --> 00:49:43,893
Tomorrow.

507
00:49:43,894 --> 00:49:47,543
You don't know when he's going to
change his testimony. Don't relax yet.

508
00:49:47,544 --> 00:49:49,223
Okay.

509
00:49:49,224 --> 00:49:53,523
Anyway, how far will you dig Noodle Master?

510
00:49:53,524 --> 00:49:56,103
Violation of Foreign Exchange
Transactions Act? Tax laws?

511
00:49:56,104 --> 00:49:58,193
Also, murder and soliciting murder...

512
00:49:58,194 --> 00:50:00,254
I'll add to it.

513
00:50:05,124 --> 00:50:10,914
Do it right if you're going to do it. There will be
bigger opposition more you try to let him have it.

514
00:50:22,264 --> 00:50:23,654
Tae Ha.

515
00:50:34,494 --> 00:50:35,944
Noodle Master.

516
00:50:37,394 --> 00:50:39,523
Want to grab a drink?

517
00:50:39,524 --> 00:50:41,024
Yes.

518
00:51:43,014 --> 00:51:45,894
I know you killed my father.

519
00:51:48,234 --> 00:51:51,294
But I won't kill a man like my father did.

520
00:51:52,284 --> 00:51:57,424
Instead, your downfall...

521
00:51:58,614 --> 00:52:01,394
I'll witness it up close.

522
00:52:02,924 --> 00:52:05,403
Do you know this?

523
00:52:05,404 --> 00:52:11,503
Your daughter... she asked me to stop
you from committing more crimes.

524
00:52:11,504 --> 00:52:14,853
But I know I can't do that.

525
00:52:14,854 --> 00:52:18,264
Stopping you from committing more crimes...

526
00:52:20,464 --> 00:52:23,044
Only you yourself can do that.

527
00:52:57,734 --> 00:52:59,443
<i>It's me, Senator.</i>

528
00:52:59,444 --> 00:53:02,783
Did you get some sleep, Noodle Master?

529
00:53:02,784 --> 00:53:05,373
<i>Thanks to you, I slept well.</i>

530
00:53:05,374 --> 00:53:08,144
<i>I'll give up the nomination.</i>

531
00:53:09,084 --> 00:53:14,093
Regarding this matter, I won't be
bothering you in the future, Senator.

532
00:53:14,094 --> 00:53:16,613
You make me feel so bad.

533
00:53:16,614 --> 00:53:20,413
But I won't go to jail.

534
00:53:20,414 --> 00:53:25,973
I gave up my dreams and
sacrificed Goong Rak Foundation.

535
00:53:25,974 --> 00:53:28,654
I don't think jail is fitting.

536
00:53:29,844 --> 00:53:34,713
I'd like to see you with Congressman Choi.
Please be our mediator.

537
00:53:34,714 --> 00:53:40,093
Well, that's not hard, but it won't be
easy to dismiss the Prosecutors' Office.

538
00:53:40,094 --> 00:53:43,713
It will be a small amount, but
I'll express my gratitude.

539
00:53:43,714 --> 00:53:47,644
If you go as far as this,
I can't ignore you.

540
00:53:48,454 --> 00:53:50,753
Let's meet together.

541
00:53:50,754 --> 00:53:54,554
Won't we come up with a solution
if we put our heads together?

542
00:53:55,194 --> 00:53:57,283
At my house?

543
00:53:57,284 --> 00:53:59,544
Sure, let's do that.

544
00:54:07,594 --> 00:54:11,213
Geez, Prosecutor Chae, I
feel so bad about this.

545
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:15,353
Something urgent came up today.
I won't be able to show.

546
00:54:15,354 --> 00:54:19,323
Look, Congressman Choi. If you break your
promise this way, I won't just stand back.

547
00:54:19,324 --> 00:54:21,453
Oh, my, scary...

548
00:54:21,454 --> 00:54:25,723
I'm getting goosebumps all over.
It's not like I can show it to you.

549
00:54:25,724 --> 00:54:28,544
Alright then. I'm busy, so...

550
00:54:51,344 --> 00:54:53,033
CEO Lee, it's me.

551
00:54:53,034 --> 00:54:56,953
The person who sent in the Witness
Application, can I meet him?

552
00:54:56,954 --> 00:54:58,964
I'll be waiting.

553
00:55:05,814 --> 00:55:11,533
♪ <i>There's still regret,
but not very much...</i> ♪

554
00:55:11,534 --> 00:55:15,073
I need to know how much more it'll
grow, so I can figure out the size.

555
00:55:15,074 --> 00:55:18,793

557
00:55:20,074 --> 00:55:24,113
Geez, the Noodle Master has no sense...

558

♪ <i>When I walk this path...</i> ♪

559
00:55:35,654 --> 00:55:38,474
I'll drive. Secretary
Park can take a break.

560
00:55:40,624 --> 00:55:42,883
Give me the key.

561
00:55:42,884 --> 00:55:45,433
I'll go with you.

562
00:55:45,434 --> 00:55:48,933
You do what you're told.
I'll be the judge always.

563
00:55:48,934 --> 00:55:51,134
Please think it over once more.

564
00:56:20,344 --> 00:56:22,734
Welcome, Noodle Master.

565
00:56:24,054 --> 00:56:26,744
Have a seat over here.

566
00:56:32,484 --> 00:56:34,703
You made the right decision.

567
00:56:34,704 --> 00:56:37,733
This isn't the only election.

568
00:56:37,734 --> 00:56:39,863
While trying to do well...

569
00:56:39,864 --> 00:56:43,573
Things like this happen. Can't
we try to be understanding?

570
00:56:43,574 --> 00:56:46,644
I apologize for making your worry.

571
00:56:49,834 --> 00:56:55,643
Geez, scared me. I have a weak heart.

572
00:56:55,644 --> 00:56:59,303
But... don't you have something to give us?

573
00:56:59,304 --> 00:57:00,913
Geez, man...

574
00:57:00,914 --> 00:57:03,553
Of course I should give it to you.

575
00:57:03,554 --> 00:57:08,033
My life depends on your
word, Congressman Choi.

576
00:57:08,034 --> 00:57:12,233
It's all for mutual benefit.

577
00:57:12,234 --> 00:57:16,913
And even if they get voted in,
some people die afterward.

578
00:57:16,914 --> 00:57:22,413
What do they call it? Oh, right, "Vacancy."
They call it vacant when the position is empty.

579
00:57:22,414 --> 00:57:27,534
What I'm saying is you'll have that type
of opportunity, so don't be too upset.

580
00:57:28,554 --> 00:57:30,804
Is that so?

581
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:44,963
Since you're sure about
testifying, I'll believe you.

582
00:57:44,964 --> 00:57:50,254
First, I'll proceed with the basic
investigation. Your name is...

583
00:57:54,434 --> 00:57:56,314
Hwang Seong Woo.

584
00:57:57,634 --> 00:57:59,953
Your title at Goong Rak Won?

585
00:57:59,954 --> 00:58:03,373
Goong Rak Won Noodle Master Ha
Jung Tae's Executive Assistant...

586
00:58:03,374 --> 00:58:05,983
and Goong Rak Won's operations manager.

587
00:58:05,984 --> 00:58:10,013
Which crime committed by the
Noodle Master would you testify?

588
00:58:10,014 --> 00:58:12,023
<i>Soliciting murder and</i>

589
00:58:12,024 --> 00:58:14,583
<i>numerous embezzlement and corruption.</i>

590
00:58:14,584 --> 00:58:17,273
Also forgery of documents and...

591
00:58:17,274 --> 00:58:24,524
I'll testify regarding assault,
blackmailing and other crimes.

592
00:58:37,024 --> 00:58:39,823
You still haven't quit smoking?

593
00:58:39,824 --> 00:58:45,054
I smoke seldom when I feel frustrated.

594
00:58:49,704 --> 00:58:52,564
Are you going to smoke?

595
00:58:59,554 --> 00:59:02,373
Gil Do, don't do it.

596
00:59:02,374 --> 00:59:04,554
<i>I'll put it back.</i>

597
00:59:06,244 --> 00:59:07,293
<i>Then...</i>

598
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:09,433
<i>- One.
- This never happened.</i>

599
00:59:09,434 --> 00:59:11,813
<i>Do you understand what I'm saying?</i>

600
00:59:11,814 --> 00:59:13,694
One.

601
00:59:15,274 --> 00:59:19,674
What's with the mood all of a sudden?
Is something wrong?

602
00:59:24,234 --> 00:59:26,064
<i>Two.</i>

603
00:59:28,934 --> 00:59:31,494
Kim Gil Do!

604
00:59:34,034 --> 00:59:37,014
<i>- Three.
- Three.</i>

605
01:00:00,724 --> 01:00:04,774
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

606
01:00:10,224 --> 01:00:14,954
There just opened up a vacancy.

607
01:00:16,874 --> 01:00:22,464
Will it be okay if I fill the empty spot?
