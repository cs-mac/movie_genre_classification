1
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,292
The nightmare again?

2
00:08:16,695 --> 00:08:18,660
Don't worry, don't worry.

3
00:08:20,922 --> 00:08:22,343
Don't worry.

4
00:08:23,576 --> 00:08:25,127
It'll soon be over.

5
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:55,652
Dad?

6
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,932
- <i>Going already?</i>
- Soon. Tod's not here yet.

7
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,103
Oh, don't go yet.

8
00:10:03,725 --> 00:10:05,147
Here.

9
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:09,773
- Happy birthday, darling.
- But it's tomorrow.

10
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:12,081
Well, what's wrong with now?

11
00:10:12,414 --> 00:10:13,566
Open it.

12
00:10:14,018 --> 00:10:16,366
Oh, sorry I couldn't
find any pretty paper.

13
00:10:17,271 --> 00:10:19,025
Oh, Dad.

14
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:22,758
It's beautiful.

15
00:10:24,182 --> 00:10:26,538
It's the most precious
thing I can give you.

16
00:10:27,904 --> 00:10:29,493
I'll treasure it.

17
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:34,435
No,no, no... Don't just treasure it.
It was meant to be worn.

18
00:10:34,664 --> 00:10:38,064
It must be worth a fortune.
Supposing I'll lose it?

19
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:39,368
You won't.

20
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:42,565
Wear it always.
Wear it now.

21
00:10:43,107 --> 00:10:46,494
Here.
Happy birthday, darling.

22
00:10:49,169 --> 00:10:50,330
Thank you.

23
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,047
Hi.

24
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:11,511
Glad you could make it.

25
00:11:47,051 --> 00:11:48,996
Shut your bloody row!

26
00:11:52,377 --> 00:11:54,608
I sometimes wonder
why I took this job.

27
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,514
Well, we know that,
don't we?

28
00:11:56,614 --> 00:11:57,978
Get him inside.

29
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,608
What about
a bit of fun?

30
00:12:05,732 --> 00:12:07,964
Let's have a look at
old Snakey Berrigan.

31
00:12:09,292 --> 00:12:12,172
My God, he hasn't been in the
jacket all night, has he?

32
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:22,035
Seem to have quietened him down;
he's not doing any of his crazy bits.

33
00:12:22,138 --> 00:12:25,529
Perhaps he'll let up later,
when we get the harness off.

34
00:12:28,872 --> 00:12:33,061
...stars... the Milky Way...
the Galaxy...

35
00:12:41,076 --> 00:12:42,668
...pulsar...

36
00:12:49,823 --> 00:12:51,211
Hello, cat.

37
00:12:53,066 --> 00:12:55,052
When are you going to
let me speak to him?

38
00:12:55,152 --> 00:12:56,529
- Who?
- Your father.

39
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:59,341
- Not now.
- Not now, what does that mean?

40
00:12:59,352 --> 00:13:01,086
You don't feed him enough.

41
00:13:01,223 --> 00:13:03,985
He should be gorged
and fat and purring.

42
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,602
Darling, there are areas of
research you can help me with.

43
00:13:06,991 --> 00:13:09,864
Sometimes I think there are only
two things you want me for.

44
00:13:11,811 --> 00:13:13,915
- You're absolutely right.
- Am I?

45
00:13:14,142 --> 00:13:16,632
Yes. Absolutely.

46
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,687
You drink too much.

47
00:13:20,787 --> 00:13:22,271
<i>Madre mia.</i>

48
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:24,304
I thought you'd never see it.

49
00:13:24,898 --> 00:13:26,861
- When did you get it?
- Birthday present.

50
00:13:26,961 --> 00:13:29,771
- From your father?
- What are you going to give me?

51
00:13:30,448 --> 00:13:32,944
I've never seen anything
so beautiful.

52
00:13:37,235 --> 00:13:39,706
He must have got it
on the expedition.

53
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:45,882
What do you know about it?

54
00:13:46,407 --> 00:13:48,432
I don't know anything
about it.

55
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,145
Don't you want to know?

56
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:51,792
I'll ask him later.

57
00:13:53,062 --> 00:13:56,783
It's the first time he's given anything
away about the expedition.

58
00:13:56,996 --> 00:13:59,544
Anything in any meaning
of the word "giving."

59
00:14:00,022 --> 00:14:03,138
No reports, no journals,
no findings—nothing.

60
00:14:03,447 --> 00:14:04,883
Absolute secrecy.

61
00:14:05,158 --> 00:14:07,113
Perhaps there was
nothing else to give.

62
00:14:07,391 --> 00:14:10,682
You've never had anything else like it?
No other presents?

63
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:12,717
No.

64
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:20,263
All these years,
and now this ring.

65
00:14:21,264 --> 00:14:24,140
It's unlike anything
I've ever seen before.

66
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,679
I know, we can find out
from a friend of mine. Okay?

67
00:14:28,979 --> 00:14:30,293
Okay.

68
00:14:40,788 --> 00:14:44,460
Be careful. He can
be dangerous.

69
00:14:45,165 --> 00:14:46,722
I'll be close at hand.

70
00:14:47,336 --> 00:14:48,722
Thank you, doctor.

71
00:15:38,514 --> 00:15:39,914
Oh, come on, Berrigan,
you know what I want,

72
00:15:40,114 --> 00:15:41,314
and it's in there,
isn't it?

73
00:15:45,121 --> 00:15:47,783
Get your hands off me,
you maniac!

74
00:15:53,942 --> 00:15:55,439
I'm afraid we
have to go, sir.

75
00:15:55,738 --> 00:15:57,356
At once, please.

76
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,928
Okay, show us
your sarcophagus.

77
00:16:14,436 --> 00:16:17,092
- Knock it off, Arthur.
- Yeah, that's what I mean.

78
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:18,585
Maybe later.

79
00:16:19,087 --> 00:16:21,212
Promises, promises.

80
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:24,616
- Hello, love.
- Hello, Tod.

81
00:16:24,773 --> 00:16:26,547
- Geoff about?
- Behind there.

82
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,588
Tod! I didn't
expect you today.

83
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,471
I wasn't planning on coming over

84
00:16:30,571 --> 00:16:32,198
but there's something
I had to show you.

85
00:16:32,298 --> 00:16:33,298
What do you make of that?

86
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:37,688
My God.

87
00:16:45,076 --> 00:16:46,723
Where'd you get this?

88
00:16:46,935 --> 00:16:49,345
- Whose is it?
- It's mine.

89
00:16:51,812 --> 00:16:53,191
Isn't it lovely?

90
00:16:54,408 --> 00:16:55,469
No!

91
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:17,936
Death is afar still.

92
00:17:18,264 --> 00:17:20,543
He will have
no use of you yet.

93
00:17:22,248 --> 00:17:25,274
There's hardship.
And strife.

94
00:17:25,374 --> 00:17:29,129
But it's outweighed by the joy
of children's voices.

95
00:17:29,325 --> 00:17:32,311
That's Teddy and Tricia,
my Ron's twins.

96
00:17:32,507 --> 00:17:34,468
Are they coming home?

97
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:39,038
Oh, it's so hot. I shall
have to take this off.

98
00:17:57,979 --> 00:18:00,047
Oh, what is it,
Miss Dickerson?

99
00:18:08,734 --> 00:18:10,871
I can't go on.
The vibrations are wrong.

100
00:18:10,971 --> 00:18:12,623
I shall have to ask you
to leave, Mrs. Caporal.

101
00:18:12,723 --> 00:18:14,637
Next week, by all
means, we'll continue.

102
00:18:14,737 --> 00:18:16,733
You saw something there
for me—you're afraid to tell me!

103
00:18:16,953 --> 00:18:19,760
Get out now.
Take your coat with you.

104
00:18:30,478 --> 00:18:32,478
It's so beautiful.

105
00:18:33,025 --> 00:18:35,486
Fantastic how it
catches the light.

106
00:18:37,271 --> 00:18:38,774
Can I have it back?

107
00:18:55,762 --> 00:18:58,071
I should ring Geoffrey,
and see how he is.

108
00:18:58,242 --> 00:18:59,868
He'll be fine.

109
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:02,378
The doctor said so.

110
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:05,594
Was it this
that frightened him?

111
00:19:06,258 --> 00:19:07,792
I thought it was me.

112
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,214
Probably reminded him
of someone.

113
00:19:11,433 --> 00:19:13,410
That's not much
of a compliment.

114
00:19:24,686 --> 00:19:26,168
He's late.

115
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:27,961
He'll be here.

116
00:19:28,942 --> 00:19:31,589
Go on, you can go.
You've fussed enough.

117
00:19:31,734 --> 00:19:34,240
I can't just leave you.
Suppose he doesn't come?

118
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,750
He'll come.

119
00:19:36,346 --> 00:19:37,963
You heard what the doctor said.

120
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:41,284
"You've got to expect these things
when you reach your age."

121
00:19:41,824 --> 00:19:44,122
Go on with you.
Don't fuss.

122
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,459
All right, then.
Look after yourself.

123
00:19:47,475 --> 00:19:48,668
Night.

124
00:20:47,744 --> 00:20:49,482
I'm glad you've come.

125
00:20:49,694 --> 00:20:51,660
I'm glad you wanted me to.

126
00:20:55,616 --> 00:20:57,289
What happened?

127
00:20:58,135 --> 00:21:00,382
- It was her.
- "Her?"

128
00:21:00,482 --> 00:21:03,861
As large as life.
Standing over there.

129
00:21:04,593 --> 00:21:05,834
And the ring.

130
00:21:06,537 --> 00:21:09,178
She who has no name.

131
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:13,558
How could it had happened?
We'd have known.

132
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,827
That damn Fuchs'd
have needed to see.

133
00:21:15,927 --> 00:21:18,386
And though he does believe
he'd do everything himself.

134
00:21:19,468 --> 00:21:21,088
But it <i>was</i> her.

135
00:21:22,177 --> 00:21:23,674
Well, don't you believe me?

136
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:26,426
Are you ready for this?

137
00:21:27,592 --> 00:21:29,723
She is Margaret Fuchs.

138
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,040
- His daughter.
- What?

139
00:21:34,482 --> 00:21:37,731
- It's impossible.
- And in a few hours' time,

140
00:21:37,943 --> 00:21:40,473
it will be her birthday.

141
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,764
<i>I, Tera,</i>

142
00:22:35,467 --> 00:22:37,146
<i>Queen of Darkness,</i>

143
00:22:37,501 --> 00:22:39,963
<i>Priestess of Ancient Egypt,</i>

144
00:22:40,649 --> 00:22:42,908
<i>have lived before.</i>

145
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:47,773
<i>My spirit has never rested
through all these weary centuries.</i>

146
00:22:48,689 --> 00:22:52,361
<i>My soul has wandered
among the boundless stars</i>

147
00:22:53,737 --> 00:22:56,711
<i>while my mortal body waited.</i>

148
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:23,539
<i>Now, as the time draw nearer
to the predestined hour,</i>

149
00:23:23,963 --> 00:23:27,993
<i>I have guided these people
towards my tomb,</i>

150
00:23:28,683 --> 00:23:32,720
<i>made them the guardians
of my most sacred relics,</i>

151
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:38,820
<i>to protect with their lives,
until they are reclaimed.</i>

152
00:23:39,824 --> 00:23:42,012
<i>That will be soon.</i>

153
00:23:43,106 --> 00:23:44,208
<i>Soon.</i>

154
00:23:46,408 --> 00:23:48,047
<i>Soon.</i>

155
00:23:52,285 --> 00:23:54,848
Can you read it,
Professor Fuchs?

156
00:23:55,830 --> 00:24:00,423
"She who is buried here,
shall henceforth have no name,

157
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:06,551
shall cease to exist
in the minds of man,

158
00:24:06,949 --> 00:24:09,949
as she has ceased
to exist in life."

159
00:25:08,471 --> 00:25:09,871
Look!

160
00:25:46,385 --> 00:25:47,507
Look!

161
00:26:22,982 --> 00:26:24,775
We <i>do</i> have her name.

162
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:31,746
Tera.

163
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:42,518
Mrs. Fuchs.

164
00:27:02,428 --> 00:27:04,042
She's dead.

165
00:27:04,128 --> 00:27:05,760
Doctor, quick!

166
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:38,428
Oh my God!
Look!

167
00:28:24,582 --> 00:28:26,528
What is it, the nightmare?

168
00:28:27,699 --> 00:28:29,088
I must get home.

169
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,234
- But darling, it's 3 AM.
- I don't care, I've got to go.

170
00:28:34,316 --> 00:28:36,634
- But now?
- Yes, now.

171
00:28:36,694 --> 00:28:38,836
Okay, okay,
I'll take you.

172
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,714
What kind of danger?

173
00:29:51,786 --> 00:29:54,412
I don't know what, I just
feel that something's wrong.

174
00:30:03,104 --> 00:30:04,492
Did you feel that?

175
00:30:04,672 --> 00:30:07,656
Yes. Something seemed to—

176
00:30:09,394 --> 00:30:10,230
Dad!

177
00:30:10,295 --> 00:30:11,916
Out of the way, we'll
have to break it in.

178
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:14,800
But I've never been down there.
Nobody's allowed down there.

179
00:30:14,882 --> 00:30:16,374
So we'll be the first.

180
00:30:23,776 --> 00:30:24,858
Dad!

181
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:27,510
Dad!

182
00:30:29,434 --> 00:30:30,879
Oh, Dad.

183
00:30:31,436 --> 00:30:33,136
How did it happen?

184
00:30:33,871 --> 00:30:35,793
There's no one else here.

185
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,598
No other way in or out.

186
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,508
Doctor Putnum
has my instructions.

187
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,988
Call him.

188
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:45,518
He left instructions?

189
00:30:45,737 --> 00:30:48,739
Did he expect this would happen?
Is this what you dreamt?

190
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,558
- Just call Putnum.
- All right.

191
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:38,302
Thank you, doctor.

192
00:31:51,045 --> 00:31:52,487
Putnum's on his way.

193
00:31:52,858 --> 00:31:54,619
Should we move him?

194
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:58,912
Yes. I'll take him
to his room.

195
00:32:00,621 --> 00:32:03,196
Don't worry.
He'll be okay.

196
00:32:11,266 --> 00:32:13,606
Do you want
the police involved?

197
00:32:13,677 --> 00:32:15,700
Well, we have to report it.

198
00:32:15,737 --> 00:32:17,864
And we must find out
what happened.

199
00:32:18,344 --> 00:32:19,815
<i>How</i> it happened.

200
00:32:21,137 --> 00:32:22,882
His instructions,
what were they?

201
00:32:22,956 --> 00:32:24,088
That there should
be no police,

202
00:32:24,363 --> 00:32:27,488
and that you and I should
make decisions on his behalf.

203
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:31,049
I see. Then he knew something
like this might happen.

204
00:32:31,208 --> 00:32:33,556
You'll have to ask him
when he wakes.

205
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,747
He must tell you everything.
For his sake as well as yours.

206
00:32:39,718 --> 00:32:41,469
Why can't you tell me?

207
00:32:42,446 --> 00:32:46,768
Truly, I wish I could, but I've never
been allowed into his total confidence

208
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:49,850
beyond the odd
hint and suggestion.

209
00:32:52,644 --> 00:32:56,845
But in those hints and suggestions,
something truly astounding.

210
00:32:57,626 --> 00:33:00,950
At last he'll be able
to show the world of science,

211
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:03,511
just how little it knows.

212
00:33:04,165 --> 00:33:06,026
I'll be back tomorrow, Margaret.

213
00:33:06,661 --> 00:33:09,006
He should stay like this
for a few days.

214
00:33:11,394 --> 00:33:13,590
If there's any change, call me.

215
00:33:14,358 --> 00:33:16,278
He's my priority.

216
00:33:17,892 --> 00:33:20,262
- Goodbye, Margaret.
- Goodbye.

217
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,580
Geoffrey.

218
00:34:01,009 --> 00:34:02,171
Can you hear me?

219
00:34:04,753 --> 00:34:06,289
Can you hear anything?

220
00:34:09,309 --> 00:34:11,228
Father, what do I have to do?

221
00:34:16,273 --> 00:34:17,976
What do I have to do?

222
00:36:23,631 --> 00:36:24,861
Tod?

223
00:36:26,163 --> 00:36:27,627
Don't be scared.

224
00:36:29,139 --> 00:36:31,979
Do you remember, me?
It was rather a long time ago.

225
00:36:32,794 --> 00:36:33,823
Tod!

226
00:36:37,919 --> 00:36:40,113
Your father and I
were friends, and I've

227
00:36:40,357 --> 00:36:42,185
come to help you,
as he can't.

228
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:44,649
Corbeck?

229
00:36:45,173 --> 00:36:47,617
He said you were never
to be allowed in this house.

230
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:52,341
You need my help now, more
than anything else in this world.

231
00:36:55,432 --> 00:36:56,532
Margaret?

232
00:37:04,651 --> 00:37:06,145
- You've seen her?
- Yes.

233
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:09,775
And you're wearing the ring.
Do you know what it means, the ruby?

234
00:37:12,757 --> 00:37:15,581
The symbol of
the god to come.

235
00:37:18,054 --> 00:37:19,651
How much do you know?

236
00:37:20,776 --> 00:37:21,876
Nothing.

237
00:37:22,412 --> 00:37:24,573
Oh, he left you
in ignorance of all this?

238
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:30,668
It's a strange
and fantastic affair,

239
00:37:30,801 --> 00:37:33,222
but it's not entirely
frightening if we know,

240
00:37:33,305 --> 00:37:35,624
if we try to understand.

241
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:43,028
The idea of this
Queen of Darkness,

242
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,244
it obsessed your father
since he was a young man,

243
00:37:45,378 --> 00:37:48,680
and he stumbled across,
uh, a veiled reference

244
00:37:48,889 --> 00:37:49,889
to such a creature,

245
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,311
<i>in a medieval tract on sorcery.</i>

246
00:37:53,461 --> 00:37:55,308
But she was buried a legend.

247
00:37:55,889 --> 00:37:57,354
And she had no name.

248
00:37:57,533 --> 00:38:00,754
And your father was determined
to find the truth, and...

249
00:38:01,175 --> 00:38:04,366
...make his mark on
the world of Egyptology.

250
00:38:05,427 --> 00:38:09,080
He dreamt of big things.
But he didn't know how big.

251
00:38:10,339 --> 00:38:11,877
So then you assembled a team?

252
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,292
Yeah.

253
00:38:13,942 --> 00:38:16,229
Yes, and began our search.

254
00:38:16,946 --> 00:38:19,347
We found her tomb
<i>in the valley of the sorcerer,</i>

255
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:22,553
<i>hidden, a secret,
for was a figure of great fear</i>

256
00:38:22,643 --> 00:38:24,898
<i>to the priests, of her time,
who killed her.</i>

257
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:29,452
I think your father must
have been driven by some...

258
00:38:29,698 --> 00:38:33,199
...occult knowledge that even he
was unaware he possessed.

259
00:38:33,485 --> 00:38:34,927
It was his destiny.

260
00:38:35,745 --> 00:38:36,981
And what then?

261
00:38:37,507 --> 00:38:38,507
Then?

262
00:38:39,482 --> 00:38:42,402
Horror. Wonder.

263
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,506
There was an attack
on one of our bearers,

264
00:38:45,525 --> 00:38:46,962
<i>and at that moment,</i>

265
00:38:47,184 --> 00:38:48,575
<i>horrifyingly,</i>

266
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,892
<i>fresh blood was released
in her veins.</i>

267
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,049
How could this be?

268
00:38:54,434 --> 00:38:57,904
How could she be
so perfectly preserved?

269
00:38:59,575 --> 00:39:00,993
And you?

270
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:06,116
Born exactly at the moment that
your father first looked on her.

271
00:39:06,276 --> 00:39:08,093
Born in her image.

272
00:39:08,694 --> 00:39:10,675
Born as we spoke her name,

273
00:39:10,795 --> 00:39:13,577
which the priests
hadn't entirely obliterated.

274
00:39:15,627 --> 00:39:16,746
Tera.

275
00:39:24,815 --> 00:39:26,465
Thought I heard
you call me.

276
00:39:26,578 --> 00:39:28,657
Yes, I... I did.

277
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:31,654
We have a visitor.

278
00:39:33,141 --> 00:39:35,380
Corbeck.
Friend to the family.

279
00:39:36,072 --> 00:39:38,412
Julian called me and
asked me to come over.

280
00:39:39,345 --> 00:39:40,541
Tod Browning.

281
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:48,523
- Suppose you heard all that.
- I did. Some of it.

282
00:39:48,715 --> 00:39:50,744
Must have sounded
insane to you.

283
00:39:51,749 --> 00:39:54,495
I have studied areas of
parapsychology, ESP, et al.

284
00:39:54,744 --> 00:39:57,630
Oh yes, parapsychology,
the paranormal plane.

285
00:39:57,865 --> 00:40:00,429
Telekinesis the
modern approach.

286
00:40:01,269 --> 00:40:04,025
She has some kind of
power, that's obvious.

287
00:40:04,349 --> 00:40:07,690
Good. I'm glad we
don't have to convince you.

288
00:40:09,772 --> 00:40:12,151
- I'd like to see her.
- Her power is astral,

289
00:40:12,251 --> 00:40:16,063
latent, able to be tapped in a way
that I do not comprehend,

290
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:19,095
and neither does Julian.
But we must understand,

291
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:22,918
or it will be directed against us
as it was against Julian.

292
00:40:23,018 --> 00:40:26,569
And that gives us
an important first task.

293
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:28,879
And what's that?

294
00:40:29,384 --> 00:40:32,539
Margaret, you must contact
all the old members of our team,

295
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,490
who bare your father
and I no love.

296
00:40:35,844 --> 00:40:37,653
Geoffrey Dandridge is
one of them, isn't he?

297
00:40:37,709 --> 00:40:38,804
Yes.

298
00:40:39,917 --> 00:40:42,801
He's a friend of mine, but
he's never once mentioned this.

299
00:40:43,885 --> 00:40:47,041
Geoffrey always preferred
to forget as much as possible

300
00:40:47,141 --> 00:40:51,228
about the entire affair.
He was a superstitious man.

301
00:40:51,765 --> 00:40:53,752
He was also a scientist.

302
00:40:55,725 --> 00:40:58,869
But, as you say, most things
begin with superstition.

303
00:40:59,812 --> 00:41:01,551
We can start with him.

304
00:41:01,978 --> 00:41:03,335
If you wish.

305
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,462
What can these people
do to help us?

306
00:41:06,711 --> 00:41:09,004
Not us. Tera.

307
00:41:09,309 --> 00:41:12,126
They can help reunite her
with her soul.

308
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:31,388
- Hello?
- Tod here, Geoffrey, how are you?

309
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:33,690
Oh, I'm fine now, Tod,
but very busy.

310
00:41:33,833 --> 00:41:35,295
It's about Julian Fuchs.

311
00:41:35,611 --> 00:41:36,611
That was his daughter,
Maragret...

312
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:40,044
- I won't have anything to do with it.
- I know why you were frightened.

313
00:41:44,189 --> 00:41:45,979
Jesus, he's scared.

314
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:47,802
Then we shall start with Berrigan.

315
00:41:48,269 --> 00:41:50,708
We thought Mr. Berrgain's
family were all dead.

316
00:41:51,146 --> 00:41:54,028
And now you're his second
visitor in the last few days.

317
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,825
- Another visitor?
- Mm.

318
00:41:56,593 --> 00:41:59,081
- Who was he, doctor?
- Oh, I've no idea.

319
00:41:59,363 --> 00:42:01,938
But you know, since that time,
he's been like a man possessed.

320
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,785
What does he do
with his time?

321
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:09,184
Every waking hour,
poring over his books.

322
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,509
Ordering more.
Always writing.

323
00:42:11,626 --> 00:42:13,289
As if time
were running out.

324
00:42:14,136 --> 00:42:18,142
I think his fantasy world
is dominated by the presence of...

325
00:42:18,907 --> 00:42:20,523
...some demoniac being.

326
00:42:20,862 --> 00:42:23,499
He fights against the clock
to try to understand,

327
00:42:23,866 --> 00:42:28,267
to bring some... order
in the world he's created himself.

328
00:42:28,492 --> 00:42:29,592
I see.

329
00:42:29,758 --> 00:42:32,329
There's no way for us
to break through to him,

330
00:42:32,429 --> 00:42:34,182
and so, you see,
we can't help him.

331
00:42:35,146 --> 00:42:36,146
Now...

332
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:40,059
I hope this won't disturb you.

333
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,828
...then came the executioners.

334
00:42:47,289 --> 00:42:49,514
- And they put the sun screws on me.
- Thank you, doctor.

335
00:42:49,819 --> 00:42:52,677
Her blood poured
out of the nails.

336
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,635
Everywhere.

337
00:42:56,633 --> 00:42:59,487
I couldn't use my hands
for four weeks.

338
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:02,120
T-th-tha—this is...

339
00:43:13,982 --> 00:43:15,979
I'm not ready yet.
There's more to do.

340
00:43:16,154 --> 00:43:17,913
Please don't be frightened.

341
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:20,150
Try to listen and understand.

342
00:43:21,242 --> 00:43:23,213
If he thinks I'm Tera, then...

343
00:43:25,554 --> 00:43:27,305
You know who I am?

344
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,514
Yes.

345
00:43:29,988 --> 00:43:32,183
And you're afraid,
aren't you?

346
00:43:34,813 --> 00:43:36,056
You're here to kill me.

347
00:43:36,346 --> 00:43:38,851
You've been waiting all these
years, torturing me,

348
00:43:38,967 --> 00:43:41,974
and now that I'm close to
the answer, you come for me?

349
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:44,515
I don't wish to kill anybody.

350
00:43:44,794 --> 00:43:47,339
I just want what's mine.
My familiar.

351
00:43:47,677 --> 00:43:49,083
The snake.

352
00:43:49,694 --> 00:43:52,457
Yes. You're powerless
without it.

353
00:43:52,872 --> 00:43:54,312
I haven't got it.

354
00:43:57,571 --> 00:43:59,270
No, no, don't, no!

355
00:43:59,738 --> 00:44:00,131
No, no, no!

356
00:44:01,125 --> 00:44:02,125
No, no...

357
00:44:02,576 --> 00:44:04,140
Not this way.

358
00:44:04,525 --> 00:44:06,780
But I think it's something to tell the
doctor and have him get it for us.

359
00:44:06,901 --> 00:44:07,901
No!

360
00:44:09,143 --> 00:44:10,730
There's another way.

361
00:44:10,878 --> 00:44:12,797
- ...no, leave me alone...
- Restrain him.

362
00:44:33,775 --> 00:44:35,114
Hello, Margaret.

363
00:44:36,085 --> 00:44:37,699
- How is he?
- Oh, he's fine.

364
00:44:37,799 --> 00:44:40,701
His neck's healing very well.
The danger has passed.

365
00:44:40,801 --> 00:44:42,418
Blood pressure's normal.

366
00:44:42,674 --> 00:44:45,791
But there is a slight
sign of paralysis.

367
00:44:46,084 --> 00:44:49,582
On the left hand side.
So be prepared.

368
00:44:51,344 --> 00:44:54,410
Have you and Mr. Browning
discovered anything of any value?

369
00:44:54,713 --> 00:44:56,448
No, it's all up to my father.

370
00:44:57,008 --> 00:45:00,646
Yes, of course, he knows,
but he was too scared.

371
00:45:00,695 --> 00:45:03,793
Never knew what kind of Pandora's Box
he might have down there.

372
00:45:03,895 --> 00:45:07,054
Wanted to keep you out of it,
so that you'd be safe.

373
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:12,284
Seems like I've been involved
all my life, doesn't it?

374
00:45:13,767 --> 00:45:15,942
Maybe even longer.

375
00:45:24,902 --> 00:45:26,415
Good night, doctor.

376
00:45:35,913 --> 00:45:38,470
- Your father's journal.
- What does it say?

377
00:45:39,525 --> 00:45:41,535
Your mother died
as you were born.

378
00:45:41,784 --> 00:45:43,885
I know. She died
giving me life.

379
00:45:44,206 --> 00:45:45,861
No, not exactly.

380
00:45:46,405 --> 00:45:47,623
What, then?

381
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:51,755
Your father and the others found
the tomb, were <i>in</i> the tomb,

382
00:45:52,004 --> 00:45:55,053
at the exact moment
of your birth in London.

383
00:45:56,199 --> 00:45:59,381
These two events were
more than a coincidence.

384
00:46:00,366 --> 00:46:04,563
They were a unity. And he says
she created this unity.

385
00:46:05,401 --> 00:46:08,411
He says here: She achieved
dominance over sleep,

386
00:46:08,678 --> 00:46:10,116
over the will.

387
00:46:10,462 --> 00:46:12,692
She would lie as if dead
in her sarcophagus,

388
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:14,550
as though willing her body,

389
00:46:14,903 --> 00:46:19,786
as though preparing for some
abstract metaphysical state.

390
00:46:21,859 --> 00:46:24,272
An astral body
with a free will.

391
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,570
A conscious intelligence.

392
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:31,428
We can keep people frozen
in suspended animation.

393
00:46:31,643 --> 00:46:34,499
People with cancer,
waiting for a cure.

394
00:46:34,904 --> 00:46:37,766
Their bodies idling
like a machine.

395
00:46:38,019 --> 00:46:40,404
Not dead, not alive.
Waiting.

396
00:46:40,682 --> 00:46:43,690
Non-life. But waiting.

397
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:48,610
I get a feeling
of great loneliness.

398
00:46:48,865 --> 00:46:51,056
Of her dreaming alone.

399
00:46:51,555 --> 00:46:54,744
Dreaming of things far different
from those around her.

400
00:46:54,889 --> 00:46:57,268
A land far away
in miles and years,

401
00:46:57,337 --> 00:46:59,072
yet close to her heart.

402
00:46:59,373 --> 00:47:01,878
No scheming and
malignant priesthood.

403
00:47:01,978 --> 00:47:06,023
No repressive archaic laws
or endless rituals of death.

404
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:10,256
A land where love is the divine
possession of the soul.

405
00:47:11,062 --> 00:47:12,610
That'll be the day.

406
00:47:12,769 --> 00:47:14,338
Don't laugh, Tod.

407
00:47:14,638 --> 00:47:18,425
I can feel it in my heart.
See it with my sleeping eyes.

408
00:47:18,879 --> 00:47:21,062
Perhaps it was her dream
to make it come true.

409
00:47:21,155 --> 00:47:23,272
Yeah. Perhaps you're right.

410
00:47:24,705 --> 00:47:25,705
Let's go.

411
00:47:38,992 --> 00:47:42,188
Does old Snakey want
his little pet, then?

412
00:47:45,918 --> 00:47:47,780
This really is something.

413
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:50,380
Old Snakey found it
in Egypt, didn't he?

414
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,035
I wonder why it makes him
feel better seeing it.

415
00:47:53,135 --> 00:47:54,751
Only Snakey knows.

416
00:47:55,089 --> 00:47:56,779
And he's not telling, is he?

417
00:47:57,031 --> 00:47:58,551
Must be a reason.

418
00:47:58,745 --> 00:48:01,104
He's crazy, that's the reason.

419
00:48:06,267 --> 00:48:08,720
Now, no more of your
screaming, okay?

420
00:48:09,187 --> 00:48:12,209
'Cause no one's gonna
take a blind bit of notice.

421
00:48:14,713 --> 00:48:17,400
- Okay, that's it.
- Must be worth a fortune.

422
00:48:17,623 --> 00:48:18,638
Must it?

423
00:48:19,445 --> 00:48:21,043
Only if you're crazy.

424
00:48:43,111 --> 00:48:44,111
Oh, dear.

425
00:48:45,391 --> 00:48:47,022
The dawn chorus has started.

426
00:48:47,454 --> 00:48:50,949
Well... Now it's your turn
to make me laugh.

427
00:50:54,379 --> 00:50:55,379
No!

428
00:50:58,037 --> 00:50:59,037
It's—it's coming!

429
00:51:01,251 --> 00:51:02,470
It's coming!

430
00:51:10,165 --> 00:51:11,684
The snake!

431
00:51:29,501 --> 00:51:30,910
Let me out!
Let me out!

432
00:51:31,102 --> 00:51:33,136
Let me out!
I don't wanna die!

433
00:51:33,487 --> 00:51:36,215
Let me out!
Let me out, oh!

434
00:52:38,001 --> 00:52:39,126
Margaret.

435
00:53:04,043 --> 00:53:05,043
Margaret.

436
00:54:49,655 --> 00:54:50,655
Margaret?

437
00:54:51,662 --> 00:54:52,662
Dad!

438
00:54:54,066 --> 00:54:55,947
Oh Dad, are you
really all right?

439
00:54:56,657 --> 00:54:59,275
- What time is it?
- No, try and lie still.

440
00:55:01,789 --> 00:55:05,238
My... my whole side...

441
00:55:06,244 --> 00:55:08,578
Dr. Putnum thought
this might happen.

442
00:55:10,353 --> 00:55:11,782
What's become of me?

443
00:55:12,283 --> 00:55:14,516
You've had a terrible shock.

444
00:55:15,893 --> 00:55:17,411
Try and remember.

445
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:20,365
I'd been out with Tod,

446
00:55:20,721 --> 00:55:23,214
and when we came back,
we found you in the cellar.

447
00:55:27,817 --> 00:55:31,162
You're safe. Oh, I was sure
you would be.

448
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:35,055
Is that why you gave me the ring?
To protect me?

449
00:55:38,894 --> 00:55:40,307
Tell me.

450
00:55:43,235 --> 00:55:45,537
It belonged to Tera,
didn't it?

451
00:55:46,377 --> 00:55:49,945
- You know?
- Everything you have belongs to her.

452
00:55:50,407 --> 00:55:51,407
But...

453
00:55:52,408 --> 00:55:54,344
How could it protect me?

454
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:03,576
The priests of her time
cut the hand from her.

455
00:56:04,753 --> 00:56:09,480
Not only did it symbolize
what they believed was her evil,

456
00:56:10,142 --> 00:56:13,840
they also thought
that with her body incomplete

457
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:15,955
her power would be destroyed.

458
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:21,355
Evidently, it wasn't that simple.

459
00:56:22,716 --> 00:56:25,033
Then this ring was on that hand.

460
00:56:26,287 --> 00:56:28,345
A talisman for you.

461
00:56:28,786 --> 00:56:30,817
I have given you so little.

462
00:56:32,026 --> 00:56:33,710
To protect me?

463
00:56:38,385 --> 00:56:41,578
Or give me her power?

464
00:56:43,919 --> 00:56:46,466
You've got to
tell me everything.

465
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:50,527
Look, Berrigan's dead. Somehow the
snake he had was transferred here.

466
00:56:52,024 --> 00:56:55,013
How could it...
so soon?

467
00:56:55,168 --> 00:56:57,675
- Listen, Corbeck's been telling me—
- Corbeck?

468
00:56:57,964 --> 00:56:59,199
Yes.

469
00:57:00,412 --> 00:57:03,709
- You called him.
- Lies are all he'll ever tell you.

470
00:57:04,429 --> 00:57:07,992
He is never to come here.
He is not to be involved.

471
00:57:08,375 --> 00:57:09,731
Not now.

472
00:57:09,931 --> 00:57:12,996
Trust me. Wait until
the time is right.

473
00:57:13,167 --> 00:57:15,389
Don't have anything
to do with Corbeck.

474
00:57:15,589 --> 00:57:17,804
This ring, if we have it,
where's the hand?

475
00:57:17,991 --> 00:57:19,132
Promise me.

476
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:12,951
Berrigan's dead.

477
00:58:14,113 --> 00:58:16,013
But you knew that.

478
00:58:16,238 --> 00:58:18,151
And we have the snake.

479
00:58:18,545 --> 00:58:20,069
But you knew that too.

480
00:58:20,337 --> 00:58:22,324
But you found me.

481
00:58:23,196 --> 00:58:26,185
I didn't know
you'd do that. I'm glad.

482
00:58:26,405 --> 00:58:29,529
My father's recovering.
He can talk.

483
00:58:29,975 --> 00:58:31,968
- He told you?
- Yes.

484
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:33,531
- Everything?
- Yes.

485
00:58:33,728 --> 00:58:36,128
And don't tell me
<i>he</i> lied.

486
00:58:36,364 --> 00:58:39,102
Delusions, theories...
He doesn't know the truth.

487
00:58:39,362 --> 00:58:41,244
But what you call
the truth is lies.

488
00:58:41,439 --> 00:58:44,439
- For your sake.
- That's what <i>he</i> said.

489
00:58:45,555 --> 00:58:47,833
You're both trying to use me,
but you don't care about

490
00:58:48,037 --> 00:58:52,182
what might happen to me.
And what you say is all lies.

491
00:58:52,809 --> 00:58:54,791
Well, not any longer.

492
00:58:55,003 --> 00:58:57,632
I'm important to this affair.
Born in her image.

493
00:58:57,795 --> 00:59:01,469
I don't know how or why, but
you need me, I do know that.

494
00:59:02,091 --> 00:59:05,908
This force may have us trapped,
but it fascinates me.

495
00:59:07,048 --> 00:59:08,438
It's part of me.

496
00:59:08,682 --> 00:59:11,061
Your father believes that
Tera is a force of evil.

497
00:59:11,274 --> 00:59:14,563
And he spent these years trying
to find the root of that force,

498
00:59:14,794 --> 00:59:17,062
while trying to keep
the evil bottled up.

499
00:59:17,312 --> 00:59:19,440
And you want
to let it loose?

500
00:59:20,365 --> 00:59:22,529
I don't accept it
as a concept.

501
00:59:22,709 --> 00:59:24,976
Then what <i>do</i> you accept?

502
00:59:25,547 --> 00:59:29,953
See, Tera is far beyond the laws
and dogma of her times.

503
00:59:30,157 --> 00:59:31,619
And of ours.

504
00:59:31,928 --> 00:59:34,533
Beyond good and evil?

505
00:59:34,761 --> 00:59:36,816
Love. Hate.

506
00:59:37,035 --> 00:59:40,026
She's a law compelling
beyond good and evil,

507
00:59:40,237 --> 00:59:44,349
and if we can find out how far
beyond, how much we can learn.

508
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:47,346
But why do we need the relics?

509
00:59:47,937 --> 00:59:50,170
I think you know why.

510
00:59:50,689 --> 00:59:53,298
You feel it.

511
00:59:55,813 --> 00:59:58,350
- Resurrection.
- Yes.

512
00:59:58,519 --> 01:00:00,321
A rebirth for Tera.

513
01:00:00,686 --> 01:00:03,565
For her knowledge.
For her ideas.

514
01:00:04,297 --> 01:00:06,758
And for us?

515
01:00:07,923 --> 01:00:10,564
Complete control.

516
01:00:10,837 --> 01:00:13,224
Over life, over death.

517
01:00:13,539 --> 01:00:15,400
Secrets hidden.
Obscured.

518
01:00:15,595 --> 01:00:17,415
Unguessed at for ages.

519
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:21,186
With our hands
to use as we will.

520
01:00:21,399 --> 01:00:23,292
And my father?

521
01:00:23,799 --> 01:00:26,809
- We cannot afford the weak.
- What do you mean?

522
01:00:27,037 --> 01:00:29,644
He has no real courage,
no real strength,

523
01:00:29,855 --> 01:00:32,393
only a cheap,
intellectual conceit.

524
01:00:32,606 --> 01:00:36,396
- But all his years of study...
- He's been afraid.

525
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:39,811
That's why he wanted nothing to with me,
and that is why he filled Berrigan

526
01:00:39,975 --> 01:00:42,465
and all the others
with the fear of God.

527
01:00:42,789 --> 01:00:45,705
Well, the meek shall
not inherit the earth.

528
01:00:45,885 --> 01:00:47,782
They wouldn't know
what to do with it.

529
01:00:48,309 --> 01:00:51,129
Can we afford
to let him be part?

530
01:00:51,456 --> 01:00:53,231
To let them control it?

531
01:00:53,442 --> 01:00:55,979
Are you going to go on
allowing them to use you?

532
01:00:56,667 --> 01:00:58,380
- No.
- Good.

533
01:00:58,567 --> 01:01:02,869
Well, then together, we will share
whatever we contrive to make.

534
01:01:03,261 --> 01:01:06,862
Tell me... What would you do
to possess it all?

535
01:01:07,459 --> 01:01:08,657
Anything.

536
01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:12,634
Well, then, together
we will do everything.

537
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,433
Not yet.

538
01:01:15,918 --> 01:01:18,312
There's still some
shopping to do.

539
01:01:19,953 --> 01:01:22,369
Dandridge annd Dickerson.

540
01:01:33,524 --> 01:01:35,940
Oh, not now, Tod,
I'm busy.

541
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:38,824
What do you mean, busy? We're
going to see Geoffrey, aren't we?

542
01:01:39,036 --> 01:01:41,054
It's not a good idea.
Look what happened last time.

543
01:01:41,246 --> 01:01:42,760
Seeing me again
might kill him.

544
01:01:43,467 --> 01:01:45,674
Yes, well,
go on home, then.

545
01:01:45,885 --> 01:01:48,346
Look, Dad's nearly recovered,
you can talk to him tomorrow,

546
01:01:48,497 --> 01:01:50,230
but just don't bother me now.

547
01:01:50,434 --> 01:01:52,842
- What do you mean?
- I'm in no danger.

548
01:01:53,062 --> 01:01:54,766
Oh, let me alone.

549
01:02:39,691 --> 01:02:42,104
My turn to surprise you.

550
01:02:43,157 --> 01:02:44,735
This is your house?

551
01:02:45,023 --> 01:02:48,062
It has some rather interesting
views. I am considering buying it,

552
01:02:48,146 --> 01:02:51,337
but I may change my mind,
it all rather depends on...

553
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,777
...circumstances.

554
01:02:59,867 --> 01:03:02,022
Do I need to
ask you to leave?

555
01:03:03,306 --> 01:03:05,274
What are you
doing to Margaret?

556
01:03:06,354 --> 01:03:08,132
Why, what's she
doing to you?

557
01:03:12,769 --> 01:03:14,946
Just tell me
where she is.

558
01:03:16,310 --> 01:03:17,525
Shopping.

559
01:03:22,385 --> 01:03:24,425
It's ten to six,
Mr. Dandridge.

560
01:03:24,714 --> 01:03:26,521
Mr. Dandridge?

561
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,765
Then you'd better go now.

562
01:03:29,063 --> 01:03:32,085
- Or you'll find the shops all shut.
- All right, then.

563
01:03:32,645 --> 01:03:34,349
But you won't work
too late, will you?

564
01:03:39,423 --> 01:03:40,590
Will you?

565
01:03:41,977 --> 01:03:43,194
You're fussing.

566
01:03:44,817 --> 01:03:46,045
All right, then,
take care.

567
01:03:46,249 --> 01:03:49,973
Oh wait, I forgot to show you this.
You didn't know, did you?

568
01:03:50,226 --> 01:03:52,418
One of your colleagues died.

569
01:03:52,681 --> 01:03:54,349
Mr. Berrigan.

570
01:03:55,036 --> 01:03:56,329
Berrigan?

571
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,535
Didn't think you knew.

572
01:04:02,948 --> 01:04:04,047
Night.

573
01:04:06,817 --> 01:04:08,255
My God.

574
01:04:49,626 --> 01:04:51,006
Corbeck?

575
01:04:54,458 --> 01:04:56,130
Tod, is that you?

576
01:04:57,647 --> 01:04:59,337
Veronica?

577
01:05:04,991 --> 01:05:06,399
Who are you?

578
01:05:13,267 --> 01:05:15,265
Are you feeling better now?

579
01:05:18,011 --> 01:05:19,818
You have a relic
from the tomb.

580
01:05:20,307 --> 01:05:22,527
The Skull of
the Sacred Jackal.

581
01:05:23,866 --> 01:05:25,386
We want it.

582
01:05:26,733 --> 01:05:28,381
You killed Berrigan.

583
01:05:29,034 --> 01:05:30,376
You and your father.

584
01:05:31,216 --> 01:05:33,808
He was afraid he'd die
if he gave it up.

585
01:05:34,236 --> 01:05:36,061
Is that what you think?

586
01:05:37,198 --> 01:05:39,966
Supposing you die
if you keep it?

587
01:05:40,421 --> 01:05:41,981
Had you thought of that?

588
01:05:43,001 --> 01:05:45,162
We want it, Mr. Dandridge!

589
01:06:51,806 --> 01:06:53,750
What the hell
are you doing here?

590
01:06:53,826 --> 01:06:55,387
I changed my mind.

591
01:06:55,598 --> 01:06:57,791
You seemed determined
that we should see Geoffrey.

592
01:06:58,012 --> 01:07:00,936
Corbeck said
you were shopping.

593
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:02,321
Did he?

594
01:07:04,516 --> 01:07:06,819
What are you two up to in there?
Where's Geoffrey?

595
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:08,512
He's not there.

596
01:07:09,235 --> 01:07:10,556
Come on, Tod.

597
01:07:11,362 --> 01:07:14,044
No. I want
to look around.

598
01:07:14,616 --> 01:07:17,596
If you must. But you'll
be wasting your time.

599
01:07:47,858 --> 01:07:49,026
Geoff?

600
01:11:13,003 --> 01:11:14,187
Look!

601
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:16,071
I know.

602
01:11:30,910 --> 01:11:32,007
Margaret?

603
01:11:34,078 --> 01:11:35,302
Margaret?

604
01:11:35,536 --> 01:11:37,177
Margaret, where are you?

605
01:11:40,297 --> 01:11:42,574
You two'd better not know
what the hell you've been doing.

606
01:11:42,762 --> 01:11:44,653
Margaret, I hope
to God you don't.

607
01:11:44,816 --> 01:11:46,601
But it's ended. We're getting
out of this, all of us.

608
01:11:46,765 --> 01:11:48,421
This is something
precious and fantastic.

609
01:11:48,632 --> 01:11:50,832
Two people have died because of
what you've been dabbling with.

610
01:11:51,004 --> 01:11:52,618
- It could kill you.
- No!

611
01:11:52,782 --> 01:11:56,099
- Or you.
- Like smoking, or driving cars.

612
01:11:56,281 --> 01:11:58,114
You <i>are</i> insane.

613
01:11:58,310 --> 01:12:00,977
- And <i>you're</i> going crazy, c'mon.
- Let me go!

614
01:12:01,794 --> 01:12:03,647
Come on, before
it's too late!

615
01:12:09,915 --> 01:12:12,015
- Where are you going?
- To get help.

616
01:12:12,187 --> 01:12:14,200
- And who can you get to help you?
- Help for you.

617
01:12:14,372 --> 01:12:16,748
Tod, don't!
Or <i>you're</i> dead!

618
01:12:16,904 --> 01:12:18,351
Tod!

619
01:12:48,075 --> 01:12:51,442
- He'd have died anyway.
- But I wished him dead!

620
01:12:58,593 --> 01:13:01,235
Don't fight it.
Let it flow through you.

621
01:13:01,383 --> 01:13:02,424
Let it be yours.

622
01:13:02,564 --> 01:13:04,692
Look at the ring.
When I saw you wearing it

623
01:13:04,864 --> 01:13:07,688
I knew the time was near, or else
he wouldn't have given it to you.

624
01:13:08,066 --> 01:13:10,825
The stars shift their relative
position in the heavens.

625
01:13:10,997 --> 01:13:14,412
Through enormous distances.
But they appear small.

626
01:13:15,161 --> 01:13:18,133
They are measured by centuries,
not by years.

627
01:13:18,451 --> 01:13:21,563
But they do not correspond to
their position in the constellation

628
01:13:21,774 --> 01:13:23,829
as it was when she was alive.

629
01:13:24,704 --> 01:13:28,758
They are in the position
that they are in now. Tonight.

630
01:13:30,044 --> 01:13:33,770
- She chose it.
- So you must not weaken.

631
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:35,727
You were born for this.

632
01:13:36,316 --> 01:13:38,933
You are coming of age.

633
01:13:49,186 --> 01:13:50,391
Margaret.

634
01:14:00,248 --> 01:14:02,004
What have you done to her?

635
01:14:02,364 --> 01:14:03,544
She's alright.

636
01:14:10,265 --> 01:14:13,141
- She needs help.
- She doesn't exist.

637
01:14:13,321 --> 01:14:15,737
She's a pawn,
an instrument, a vessel.

638
01:14:15,916 --> 01:14:17,868
- No!
- Oh, let's face it.

639
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:21,121
When tonight is over, she will
be dead, and Tera will live.

640
01:14:21,292 --> 01:14:24,387
- It is tonight, isn't it?
- No, no...

641
01:14:24,589 --> 01:14:26,631
I won't go through with it.
Not now.

642
01:14:26,786 --> 01:14:30,484
All you've done is lock yourself
in here and play games.

643
01:14:30,656 --> 01:14:32,276
"How clever I am."

644
01:14:32,788 --> 01:14:36,546
"How is it possible? Wouldn't it
be fun if it were all true?"

645
01:14:36,751 --> 01:14:39,255
Well, it <i>is</i> true.
Undeniably so.

646
01:14:39,395 --> 01:14:40,666
And you?

647
01:14:41,247 --> 01:14:42,929
You are scared.

648
01:14:43,101 --> 01:14:46,982
Every waking moment,
you are scared.

649
01:14:47,090 --> 01:14:49,377
And she's made you see,
hasn't she?

650
01:14:49,516 --> 01:14:53,130
See your conceits.
See your games.

651
01:14:53,519 --> 01:14:56,470
Tera has given you a warning.

652
01:14:57,250 --> 01:15:01,004
"Don't let me down.
Don't try and back out,

653
01:15:01,159 --> 01:15:03,588
or you are dead."

654
01:15:04,799 --> 01:15:06,743
You know what
you've got to do.

655
01:15:07,427 --> 01:15:10,074
And you know that
there's no help for her.

656
01:15:10,997 --> 01:15:12,167
Yes.

657
01:15:12,905 --> 01:15:15,425
Then I'll just go
and bring some things,

658
01:15:15,621 --> 01:15:18,574
and then I think we'll be
almost ready for her, won't we?

659
01:15:45,657 --> 01:15:47,201
The one last relic.

660
01:15:49,072 --> 01:15:51,290
The third phase of her soul.

661
01:15:52,374 --> 01:15:54,788
Without it, we can
stop this nightmare.

662
01:15:57,478 --> 01:16:00,014
Unless it's all too late?

663
01:16:10,567 --> 01:16:11,847
Tod!

664
01:16:12,863 --> 01:16:14,490
Tod!

665
01:16:24,958 --> 01:16:26,390
Do it.

666
01:16:27,112 --> 01:16:30,286
Using her as a guinea pig?
As an experiment?

667
01:16:31,112 --> 01:16:34,240
Put her out.
She mustn't awake.

668
01:16:34,367 --> 01:16:36,073
Mustn't be conscious.

669
01:16:39,373 --> 01:16:40,513
Do it.

670
01:16:46,747 --> 01:16:50,451
Time is just a moment
out of space.

671
01:16:51,575 --> 01:16:54,652
What are the dead
but memory?

672
01:16:54,902 --> 01:16:57,789
And when the memory dies...

673
01:17:06,971 --> 01:17:08,649
There are mighty things,

674
01:17:09,783 --> 01:17:12,899
but life itself is mightier.

675
01:17:13,935 --> 01:17:17,307
Life itself is...

676
01:17:19,521 --> 01:17:22,342
Life itself is...

677
01:17:36,678 --> 01:17:38,061
Get back to bed, Margaret.

678
01:17:38,217 --> 01:17:40,917
I'm going to give you something
to help you sleep for a while.

679
01:17:41,097 --> 01:17:41,987
Useless.

680
01:17:42,207 --> 01:17:44,609
But you're not well, Margaret.
You need to rest.

681
01:17:44,781 --> 01:17:47,233
I've been sleeping too long.

682
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:49,287
Julian!

683
01:17:50,471 --> 01:17:52,109
Afraid?

684
01:17:52,657 --> 01:17:56,739
I'm only trying to help you.
Why should I be afraid?

685
01:17:57,156 --> 01:18:00,141
Because I want
to see you die!

686
01:18:39,516 --> 01:18:40,684
Putnum!

687
01:19:03,050 --> 01:19:04,253
No...

688
01:19:41,001 --> 01:19:43,199
What are you going to
do with the body, Julian?

689
01:19:43,879 --> 01:19:47,203
You have an incinerator.
It takes longer, but it's safer.

690
01:19:47,851 --> 01:19:50,871
You see, I'm not even going
to ask you why you killed him.

691
01:19:51,435 --> 01:19:54,476
Now, then, let me
give you a hand.

692
01:19:57,634 --> 01:19:59,603
But you've done enough
to ruin everything.

693
01:19:59,758 --> 01:20:03,276
You've sat and studied, brooded,
and watched and done nothing.

694
01:20:03,455 --> 01:20:05,243
But I've searched,
I've traveled the world.

695
01:20:05,383 --> 01:20:07,266
I've come to
the age of understanding.

696
01:20:07,414 --> 01:20:09,308
I have recovered
the Scroll of Life.

697
01:20:09,472 --> 01:20:13,170
Soon the moment will be here.
Tera will be reborn.

698
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:16,881
- But you don't understand...
- I understand everything.

699
01:20:17,045 --> 01:20:18,895
That you  need me,
that we need Margaret,

700
01:20:19,043 --> 01:20:20,497
and that only I
can control her.

701
01:20:20,661 --> 01:20:24,453
No, not anymore.
It's out of our hands.

702
01:20:24,609 --> 01:20:27,975
- Tera's in control.
- <i>We</i> control Tera.

703
01:20:28,772 --> 01:20:32,263
<i>We</i> give her life.
Without us she's dust and ashes.

704
01:20:32,434 --> 01:20:35,826
Now, then.
Where is Margaret?

705
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:39,326
She killed Putnum,
and ran out.

706
01:20:39,441 --> 01:20:41,293
God only knows where.

707
01:20:42,168 --> 01:20:44,494
We know where,
don't we?

708
01:20:57,926 --> 01:20:58,903
Answer it.

709
01:21:07,813 --> 01:21:09,238
Help me.

710
01:21:14,256 --> 01:21:15,410
I'm...

711
01:21:16,571 --> 01:21:18,347
Margaret Fuchs.

712
01:21:18,758 --> 01:21:20,422
Gunther.

713
01:21:20,596 --> 01:21:22,630
Must be his daughter.

714
01:21:23,322 --> 01:21:24,368
Margaret?

715
01:21:29,392 --> 01:21:30,713
Margaret?

716
01:21:32,553 --> 01:21:34,954
No! It's happened!

717
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:36,708
You have to help me.

718
01:21:37,316 --> 01:21:38,799
You know its power.

719
01:21:38,963 --> 01:21:40,499
I have no mind left.
No will.

720
01:21:40,655 --> 01:21:43,243
I'll face you!
I won't run!

721
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:50,397
She can live or die,
I'll be safe.

722
01:21:50,729 --> 01:21:52,779
<i>You'll</i> be safe
if you give it to me.

723
01:21:53,629 --> 01:21:55,441
Yes, I'll get you.

724
01:21:55,622 --> 01:21:57,595
Only don't make it kill me.
Please.

725
01:21:57,822 --> 01:21:59,152
Don't!

726
01:22:07,486 --> 01:22:09,390
Yes, that's it,
give it to me.

727
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:35,840
No!

728
01:22:37,336 --> 01:22:38,336
No!

729
01:22:42,928 --> 01:22:44,584
No, don't!

730
01:22:48,687 --> 01:22:50,167
No, don't! Don't!

731
01:22:56,527 --> 01:22:57,527
No, don't!

732
01:23:03,897 --> 01:23:06,001
No, no! Don't!

733
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:01,299
Come.

734
01:24:03,799 --> 01:24:05,265
We must go.

735
01:25:08,504 --> 01:25:10,050
The Scroll of Life.

736
01:26:48,905 --> 01:26:51,145
No! No, don't read the scroll.

737
01:26:51,285 --> 01:26:52,331
Destroy it!

738
01:26:52,495 --> 01:26:54,319
It can only bring
evil and destruction.

739
01:26:54,459 --> 01:26:57,094
The worst that's in you.
The worst that's in all of us.

740
01:26:57,234 --> 01:26:58,994
That's all we've seen
from this business.

741
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:01,115
But it's not what Tera wants.

742
01:27:01,816 --> 01:27:04,539
You've abused the power
she's given you, thanks to him.

743
01:27:05,251 --> 01:27:06,576
Do it my way.

744
01:27:06,977 --> 01:27:09,424
Wait and watch,
with patience and trust.

745
01:27:09,695 --> 01:27:12,124
Wait until <i>she</i> is ready.

746
01:27:13,755 --> 01:27:15,685
She is ready now.

747
01:27:15,849 --> 01:27:17,757
All but the lamps.

748
01:27:18,365 --> 01:27:21,550
No...
Not like this.

749
01:27:21,979 --> 01:27:26,196
You can't only have good things,
beautiful things, holy things.

750
01:27:26,602 --> 01:27:29,072
They're worthless
without their opposites.

751
01:27:31,569 --> 01:27:33,098
Get the lamps.

752
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:34,220
No.

753
01:27:36,461 --> 01:27:38,102
The lamps.

754
01:28:06,495 --> 01:28:09,408
Celestial Osiris,
Isis and Horus,

755
01:28:09,548 --> 01:28:12,259
this before us is
a child of the gods,

756
01:28:12,399 --> 01:28:14,944
a being of majesty
and might.

757
01:28:15,457 --> 01:28:19,298
Her astral spirit wanders
the cold places and dark,

758
01:28:19,437 --> 01:28:23,028
seeking reunion with her soul,
with her body,

759
01:28:23,396 --> 01:28:24,816
so that she may rise,

760
01:28:24,987 --> 01:28:27,529
as is the privilege and
destiny of the gods,

761
01:28:27,661 --> 01:28:30,770
so that she may
walk again on this earth.

762
01:28:31,044 --> 01:28:33,470
Let life flow again
in this body,

763
01:28:33,634 --> 01:28:35,192
let the soul rejoin it,

764
01:28:35,348 --> 01:28:38,696
let the astral spirit
be rekindled.

765
01:28:39,009 --> 01:28:41,574
Osiris, Isis, Horus...

766
01:28:41,746 --> 01:28:44,016
What use is this
if we're to die?

767
01:28:44,722 --> 01:28:47,168
Instruments of her will,
using all of us.

768
01:28:47,323 --> 01:28:48,693
You didn't find her.

769
01:28:48,850 --> 01:28:51,034
She found you and
led you to the tomb.

770
01:28:51,237 --> 01:28:53,487
Made you devote yourself
to her.

771
01:28:53,717 --> 01:28:57,041
And the others? Just guarding
the relics with their lives?

772
01:28:58,206 --> 01:29:00,623
More chances for her
to be reborn.

773
01:29:00,795 --> 01:29:03,371
Once she regains her place
usurped by the priests.

774
01:29:03,607 --> 01:29:05,204
We're as meaningless
as all the dead.

775
01:29:05,392 --> 01:29:06,679
These thousands of years.

776
01:29:07,055 --> 01:29:09,866
But, Margaret, you died
when your mother died.

777
01:29:10,045 --> 01:29:12,282
And suddenly,
you were alive.

778
01:29:13,763 --> 01:29:15,602
She is you!

779
01:29:17,479 --> 01:29:21,859
- He mustn't finish the scroll.
- Osiris, Isis, Horus,

780
01:29:22,078 --> 01:29:25,562
I command thee, gods of
the upper and lower worlds...

781
01:29:38,391 --> 01:29:39,936
The scroll.

782
01:30:13,484 --> 01:30:15,358
Help me!

783
01:30:15,559 --> 01:30:17,279
Help me!

784
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:20,841
Help me...

785
01:31:44,913 --> 01:31:47,437
- Is there no information?
- Nothing.

786
01:31:47,597 --> 01:31:49,595
She's the same as she was
when they brought her in.

787
01:31:49,743 --> 01:31:51,855
Naked and more dead
than alive.

788
01:31:52,003 --> 01:31:54,291
- No relatives, no visitors?
- None.

789
01:31:54,486 --> 01:31:57,202
They say all the others were
crushed beyond recognition.

790
01:31:57,581 --> 01:32:00,112
She's the only one who
can tell us who she is.
