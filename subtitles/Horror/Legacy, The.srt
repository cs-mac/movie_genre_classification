than I ever dreamed

12

than I ever imagined.

MAN: We built a new grid
for programs and users.

24
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:20,244
Now, I couldn't be in there all the time,

25
00:02:20,347 --> 00:02:25,410

that could think.

Good evening. Our lead story.

51
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:15,124
ENCOM CEO and video game icon
Kevin Flynn has disappeared.

52
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:18,255
He was best known for designing Tron
and Space Paranoids,

53
00:04:18,365 --> 00:04:21,095
the two bestselling video games
in history.

54
00:04:21,235 --> 00:04:24,329
Flynn took ownership of ENCOM
in 1982

55
00:04:24,438 --> 00:04:27,805
as the company skyrocketed
to the top of the tech industry.

56
00:04:27,908 --> 00:04:32,208
But things changed in 1985
with the untimely death of Flynn's wife,

57
00:04:32,312 --> 00:04:34,803
the mother of his young son, Sam.

58
00:04:34,915 --> 00:04:36,883
Recently, ENCOM board members

59
00:04:36,984 --> 00:04:38,212
have been troubled by reports

60
00:04:38,318 --> 00:04:41,287
of Flynn's erratic,
even obsessive, behavior.

61
00:04:41,388 --> 00:04:45,085
With Flynn missing,
the company is now in chaos.

62
00:04:45,192 --> 00:04:47,387
This afternoon, ENCOM's board

63
00:04:47,494 --> 00:04:50,657
moved to seize control
from Flynn's partner, Alan Bradley,

64
00:04:50,764 --> 00:04:53,733
vowing to return the company
to profitability.

65
00:04:54,134 --> 00:04:59,037
Loyal to the end, Bradley maintains
his belief that Flynn is not missing

66
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:01,733
and is instead pursuing his dream of

67
00:05:01,842 --> 00:05:05,278
"a digital frontier
to reshape the human condition."

Kevin Flynn may have simply
run away.

hope for his imminent return,

to happen more than young Sam Flynn,

Yeah. He got your page.

Of course.

His patience usually beats out

533
00:52:11,535 --> 00:52:13,833
Flynn shared them with me.

534
00:52:13,938 --> 00:52:15,735
I've read them all.

Flynn is teaching me
about the art of the selfless,

about removing oneself
from the equation.

KEVIN: With my disk, it's possible.
SAM: And then what?

660
01:00:15,552 --> 01:00:17,281
Game over.

661

The guy doesn't dig imperfection.

662
01:00:22,459 --> 01:00:24,927
What's more imperfect than our world?

663
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:29,796
I can't let that happen. I won't.

664
01:00:30,267 --> 01:00:33,430
So what do we do? Nothing?

665
01:00:33,537 --> 01:00:36,472
It's amazing how productive
doing nothing can be.

666
01:00:36,573 --> 01:00:40,168
Clu's planning something.
We've known that for a while.

There's unrest out there,
even revolution.

669
01:00:44,782 --> 01:00:48,980
If we sit tight, Clu might
be brought down from the inside.

670
01:00:49,086 --> 01:00:52,385
SAM: If the portal is closing, we can't
sit around. We have to move now.

671
01:00:52,489 --> 01:00:57,290
Tell me, what brought you here,
to the Grid?

672
01:00:57,828 --> 01:00:59,693
Alan got your page.

673
01:00:59,797 --> 01:01:02,527
I didn't send any page.

674
01:01:03,033 --> 01:01:04,261
It was Clu.

675
01:01:04,368 --> 01:01:07,235
Clu sent that page.
That's why you're here.

676
01:01:07,337 --> 01:01:10,306
This is all his design.
He wanted a new piece

677
01:01:10,407 --> 01:01:12,841
on the board to change the game!

678
01:01:12,943 --> 01:01:15,002
With you, he got more
than he ever dreamed.

679
01:01:15,112 --> 01:01:20,243
This is precisely what he wants.
Us together heading for the portal.

680
01:01:20,350 --> 01:01:24,480
It's his game now.
The only way to win is not to play.

681
01:01:26,523 --> 01:01:28,423
Well, that's a hell of a way to live.

682
01:01:28,525 --> 01:01:30,083
But it is a way.

683
01:01:34,898 --> 01:01:36,729
We can go home.

684

Don't you want that?

685

past things like wants and hopes.

That's great, Dad.
Keep telling yourself that.

687

Good night, Sam.

688
01:02:22,279 --> 01:02:24,577
How can he be so afraid
of his own creation?

689
01:02:24,681 --> 01:02:27,844
I mean, he built Clu.
Why doesn't he just end him?

690
01:02:29,152 --> 01:02:31,211
He could,
but it would require reintegration.

691
01:02:31,321 --> 01:02:32,788
Yeah, all right.

692
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:36,553
Flynn would never survive the event.
It would mean the end of them both.

I'm going through the portal.

696

Clu wants Flynn's disk, not mine.

697
01:02:50,674 --> 01:02:55,270
I'm going to find Alan and we'll figure
this thing out from the other side.

698
01:02:55,379 --> 01:02:58,815
This may be Clu's game here, but
in my world, he's gone in one keystroke.

699
01:02:58,916 --> 01:03:02,181
But I can't do anything
unless I get to the portal.

in this place for eternity either.

We do nothing.

We do it your way.
Full-on sprint to the portal.

If we beat Clu there, we have a chance.

Let's get her out of here.

This'll take us there.

- Is she gonna make it?
- I don't know.

is just enormously complex.

- Some of it. The rest of it is just

beyond me.

866

She's an ISO.

KEVIN: Yeah. The last ISO.

868
01:21:27,256 --> 01:21:28,621
SAM: All this time,

869
01:21:28,724 --> 01:21:31,056
you were just protecting her.

- Wireless interlinking.

- Of digital devices?
- Yeah.

892

I said I'd show you the Grid.

You should have seen this place
back then.

903

I couldn't wait to show it to you.
Could not wait.

Chasing after
what was right in front of me.

Right in front of me.

Twenty years in the shed, no tarp.

Well, when I'm done, better than ever.

You will.

926
01:25:43,111 --> 01:25:45,545
She's rebooting. Give her this.

The old man's gonna knock on the sky,

entered the space,

our understanding is still valid?

935
01:26:38,667 --> 01:26:40,760
Control of the city?

936
01:26:41,370 --> 01:26:44,339
A sizeable request, I know.

937
01:26:44,439 --> 01:26:47,272
But seemingly fitting compensation.

searching for this, Clu?

uneasy.

But always necessary.

953
01:27:42,297 --> 01:27:43,924
You know you need me

954
01:27:44,066 --> 01:27:46,034

I should never have sent you to Zuse.
It was a mistake.

It's okay. I've made a few myself.

Where is he?

969
01:28:42,557 --> 01:28:45,390
SAM: I think he's knocking on the sky.

Yeah.

I know.

01:29:12,988 --> 01:29:15,286
QUORRA: It was during the Purge.

976
01:29:16,458 --> 01:29:18,392
Clu was relentless.

977
01:29:18,794 --> 01:29:22,127
The Black Guard were executing ISOs
in the streets.

978
01:29:23,298 --> 01:29:26,028
Everyone I knew disappeared.

979
01:29:28,703 --> 01:29:30,728
Then they came for me.

980
01:29:33,508 --> 01:29:35,408
So I ran.

981
01:29:36,511 --> 01:29:39,776
A sympathetic program
smuggled me out of the city.

982
01:29:39,881 --> 01:29:42,372
But soon they had me surrounded.

983
01:29:42,484 --> 01:29:44,475
I prepared for the end.

984

01:46:14,508 --> 01:46:16,806
(ENGINE STOPS)

1148
01:46:22,116 --> 01:46:23,913
(ENGINE STOPS)

1149
01:46:26,854 --> 01:46:27,912
(LAUGHS)

1150
01:46:37,398 --> 01:46:38,763
Yes!

1151
01:46:50,311 --> 01:46:51,335
It's jammed.

1152
01:46:56,951 --> 01:47:00,216
Tron. What have you become?

1153
01:47:05,259 --> 01:47:06,556
Oh, come on.

1154
01:47:09,763 --> 01:47:12,288
TRON: Flynn, go!

1155
01:47:15,769 --> 01:47:17,964
CLU: Rinzler! Take the shot!

1156
01:47:20,875 --> 01:47:22,570
Finish the game!

1157
01:47:30,451 --> 01:47:32,385
Roll!

1158
01:47:44,798 --> 01:47:47,494
TRON: I fight for the users.

1159
01:47:48,068 --> 01:47:49,592
(SCREAMS)

1160
01:47:57,478 --> 01:47:59,946
That's it. It's over.

1161
01:48:00,915 --> 01:48:01,939
It's over!

1162
01:48:02,583 --> 01:48:03,914
(LAUGHS)

1163
01:48:04,084 --> 01:48:05,881
QUORRA: Whoo!

1164
01:48:13,394 --> 01:48:16,522
Quorra, there's something
I need you to do.

1165
01:49:05,245 --> 01:49:07,145
Let's get you home, Dad.

1166
01:49:11,218 --> 01:49:12,515
There it is.

1167
01:49:13,153 --> 01:49:17,385
- Take her down.
- Hang on. This could be rough.

1168
01:50:09,576 --> 01:50:11,771
This is mine.

1169
01:50:16,984 --> 01:50:19,077
I had a feeling you'd be here!

1170
01:50:19,219 --> 01:50:23,019
(LAUGHS) The cycles
haven't been kind, have they?

1171
01:50:23,957 --> 01:50:26,221
Oh, you don't look so bad.

1172
01:50:27,528 --> 01:50:31,089
I did everything.
Everything you ever asked.

1173
01:50:31,698 --> 01:50:33,427
I know you did.

1174
01:50:33,534 --> 01:50:36,833
- CLU: I executed the plan!
- As you saw it.

1175
01:50:36,970 --> 01:50:42,135
You... You promised that we
would change the world together.

1176
01:50:42,543 --> 01:50:44,670
- You broke your promise.
- I know.

1177
01:50:44,945 --> 01:50:46,310
I understand that now.

1178
01:50:46,413 --> 01:50:49,849
I took this system
to its maximum potential.

1179
01:50:49,950 --> 01:50:52,077
I created the perfect system!

1180
01:50:52,186 --> 01:50:55,917
The thing about perfection
is that it's unknowable.

1181
01:50:57,091 --> 01:51:01,687
It's impossible but it's also
right in front of us all the time.

1182
01:51:01,829 --> 01:51:05,458
You wouldn't know that
because I didn't when I created you.

1183
01:51:07,267 --> 01:51:08,996
I'm sorry, Clu.

1184
01:51:11,138 --> 01:51:13,538
I'm sorry.

1185
01:51:25,986 --> 01:51:27,044
(YELLS)

1186
01:51:35,262 --> 01:51:36,456
Go.

1187
01:51:49,910 --> 01:51:51,002
Clu!

1188
01:51:51,979 --> 01:51:54,243
Remember what you came for.

1189
01:52:08,262 --> 01:52:09,251
Dad!

1190
01:52:09,396 --> 01:52:10,863
CLU: You knew I'd beat you.

1191
01:52:11,031 --> 01:52:14,057
And still you did all this? For him.

1192
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:21,468
No.

1193
01:52:27,080 --> 01:52:28,342
No!

1194
01:52:28,448 --> 01:52:29,779
Why?

1195
01:52:31,485 --> 01:52:32,850
He's my son.

1196
01:52:39,226 --> 01:52:40,215
Go!

1197
01:52:46,099 --> 01:52:47,157
Dad!

1198
01:52:53,740 --> 01:52:55,867
Sam! It's time!

1199
01:52:56,143 --> 01:52:57,269
No!

1200
01:52:57,678 --> 01:53:00,408
Sam, it's what he wants.

1201
01:53:02,482 --> 01:53:04,382
I'm not leaving you!

1202
01:53:04,818 --> 01:53:06,285
Take her!

1203
01:53:17,764 --> 01:53:19,322
Yes!

1204
01:53:47,027 --> 01:53:48,688
Goodbye, kiddo.

1205
01:54:17,357 --> 01:54:19,325
(GROANS)

1206
01:54:20,027 --> 01:54:21,892
No!

1207
01:55:32,833 --> 01:55:34,630
SAM: Al?

1208
01:55:39,072 --> 01:55:40,869
ALAN: You paged me?

1209
01:55:41,408 --> 01:55:43,035
Yeah.

1210
01:55:43,844 --> 01:55:46,108
I need you at ENCOM at 8:00 a.m.

1211
01:55:48,081 --> 01:55:49,571
What about the board?

1212
01:55:51,251 --> 01:55:53,151
You're chairman now.

1213
01:55:55,489 --> 01:55:57,923
I'm taking the company back, Alan.

1214
01:56:02,028 --> 01:56:03,222
Oh, and...

1215
01:56:04,531 --> 01:56:06,158
You were right.

1216
01:56:07,868 --> 01:56:09,267
About what?

1217
01:56:10,937 --> 01:56:12,495
About everything.

1218
01:56:37,397 --> 01:56:38,659
QUORRA: What's next, Sam?

1219
01:56:44,471 --> 01:56:47,838
I guess we're supposed
to change the world.

1220
01:56:51,912 --> 01:56:54,608
Come on. I wanna show you something.
