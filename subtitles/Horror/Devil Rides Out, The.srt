1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Melody of Love

2
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:09,970
Goodbye.

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,340
We'll never meet again.

4
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,990
Every day is a dream

5
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:55,000
I can't believe this is real

6
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,730
Every day

7
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:02,190
This feels like magic

8
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:07,170
I'm getting closer to you

9
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,440
Will you listen to my heart?

10
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,730
Wasn't that great?

11
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,200
Yeah.

12
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,970
I definitely saw an improvement.

13
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,060
Deulim's up next?

14
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:29,800
Begin.

15
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:35,440
Every day is a dream

16
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:39,660
I can't believe this is real

17
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,470
Every day

18
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:47,240
This feels like magic

19
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,300
I'm getting...

20
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,740
I'm sorry. I'll do that again.

21
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,940
That won't be necessary.

22
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,900
Let's give her another chance.

23
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,940
Deulim, whenever you're ready.

24
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,370
Thank you.

25
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,740
That won't be necessary.

26
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,470
Shouldn't we give her another chance?

27
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,590
We're in the middle of auditions.

28
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,690
She can rehearse as much as she wants,

29
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,890
but there's only one chance at auditions.

30
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,270
We're not here to give out free chances.

31
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,140
That's as far as she goes.

32
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,530
I guess we have no choice.

33
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,260
You're the last one, right?

34
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,890
Yes.

35
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,030
Good work.

36
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,530
That was really ruthless.

37
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,400
Let's go.

38
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,090
Get ready.

39
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,900
I'll be in my office.

40
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,300
You did well. Don't worry.

41
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,090
You would have gotten high marks if you didn't make that mistake.

42
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,700
What a shame.

43
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,600
That's okay.

44
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,190
You were great up there.

45
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,260
Really?

46
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,690
You amazed me.

47
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,800
Today I saw why you were the lead.

48
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,560
I don't know what to say.

49
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,130
Are we going out to dinner tonight?

50
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,490
Should we go?

51
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,040
You worked hard for the auditions.

52
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,300
Let's go.

53
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:55,890
Let's go.

54
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,890
Come join us.

55
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,200
Do you mind if I go home?

56
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,030
Did something happen?

57
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,640
You seem down.

58
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,160
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

59
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,440
If you want to become a successful musical star,

60
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:18,040
you have to let go of some of your other desires.

61
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,240
It's not easy to achieve your dream.

62
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:26,800
Don't lose focus in the next round of auditions.

63
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,840
You said you want to prove yourself.

64
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,560
Live up to that.

65
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,960
I will.

66
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,890
You'd be at the top if it wasn't for the mistake.

67
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,370
Thank you.

68
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,500
Go home and rest if you don't feel like joining the dinner party.

69
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:47,100
But promise me you'll do nothing but rest.

70
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,840
All right.

71
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,400
Suim.

72
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,190
Are you busy?

73
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,740
No. Come in.

74
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,300
Sit.

75
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,500
I heard you're having auditions today.

76
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,300
Were you worried about Deulim?

77
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,370
She wasn't feeling well yesterday.

78
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,740
I could tell.

79
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,000
Did she do badly today?

80
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,690
She made a mistake.

81
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,890
She did?

82
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,160
But she worked so hard.

83
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,540
Her throat wasn't in the best condition.

84
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,600
I was a little hard on her.

85
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,240
She might not get a part?

86
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,970
We're doing evaluations now.

87
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,130
I can't give you the results.

88
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,000
Oh no.

89
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,060
She has another round of auditions left.

90
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,800
She'll have to prepare herself.

91
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,560
Can she overturn these results?

92
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,300
We'll have to wait and see.

93
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,540
Everyone's working really hard though.

94
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:07,170
I didn't want to ask you this,

95
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,470
but can you help her out?

96
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,560
If she doesn't get a role,

97
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:14,690
I'll feel horrible.

98
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,240
Why should you feel guilty?

99
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:23,870
I told her to give up Hyeonu and focus on her career.

100
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,300
I felt so cheap saying that.

101
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:33,170
Do you think she gave up Hyeonu for you?

102
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,090
I don't know what she's thinking.

103
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:44,300
I can't tell if she knows the truth about us or if she's really tired of Hyeonu.

104
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,740
But there's no way to ask.

105
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,470
What'll you do if Deulim knows the truth?

106
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,160
And she gave him up for you?

107
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,100
I don't know.

108
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,000
I don't even want to think about it.

109
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,190
I thought she'd do well today though.

110
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,530
What if she can't win any roles?

111
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,630
I know how you feel but I can't do her any favors.

112
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,940
Deulim wouldn't want that, either.

113
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:16,170
Yeah. I was stupid.

114
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:22,600
Hyeonu would want to know the results, too.

115
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,260
You should call him.

116
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,000
Once the results are out.

117
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:31,240
Don't feel too guilty.

118
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,740
I know how hard this was for you.

119
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,690
Taegyeong.

120
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,900
This is so hard.

121
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,800
But I can't tell anyone.

122
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,330
This feeling

123
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,090
Is coming to me every day

124
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,790
Every day

125
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:03,900
Deulim.

126
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,530
Suim.

127
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,690
Why are you practicing again?

128
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,130
I made a couple mistakes.

129
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,590
There's another round.

130
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,730
Don't push yourself too hard.

131
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,860
What if you ruin your voice?

132
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,990
Why don't you rest today?

133
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,690
Were you worried about me?

134
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,360
I wanted to come to support you but I was too late.

135
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,790
I'm glad you didn't see it.

136
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,090
If you saw me make that mistake,

137
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,990
you would've been really upset.

138
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,670
Deulim.

139
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,670
Should we go have some fun?

140
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,330
We can watch a movie and go eat out.

141
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,490
Really? Okay.

142
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,300
Here.

143
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,590
That's okay.

144
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,090
Eat up.

145
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,300
You're trying to stay thin, right?

146
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,690
Yeah. I want t o look pretty.

147
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:01,140
It's been so long since we laughed like this.

148
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,140
Deulim.

149
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,960
I'm sorry I put you through a hard time.

150
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,770
I really am.

151
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,840
That's okay.

152
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,890
I'm the one who yelled at you without knowing how you felt.

153
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,600
I didn't want to do that.

154
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:22,440
I should have helped you.

155
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,440
I'm sorry I didn't.

156
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:28,490
Suim. I'm fine.

157
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:34,800
Can you really break up with that man?

158
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,990
You really like him.

159
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,540
Why are you mentioning him again?

160
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:45,290
He's the reason you didn't do well on your audition, isn't it?

161
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,870
It's not that.

162
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,590
I was overreaching.

163
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,670
It happens when dumb kids try to cram for an exam the night before.

164
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,890
I have such a positive personality.

165
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,000
Look at me, eating like this.

166
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,400
Eat up.

167
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,100
Don't worry about me.

168
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,800
And don't give up on that guy of yours.

169
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:20,690
Why does this taste so bad?

170
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,140
It's sweet to me.

171
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,240
Maybe you lost your appetite.

172
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,670
He's been like that ever since he went to the other dry cleaner's.

173
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,770
Why?

174
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,900
Did you go there to spy?

175
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,770
Yes, because we had no customers.

176
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,670
That place was crowded though.

177
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,770
It's probably temporary.

178
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,940
So don't worry.

179
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,540
You don't know how customers are.

180
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,870
That's the way it is with restaurants.

181
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,490
Even if the food is good,

182
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,490
they all go to the new place on the block.

183
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,790
We might lose money this month.

184
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,270
How will we fill the hole?

185
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,670
We might have to close down the shop.

186
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,640
What'll we do?

187
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,400
Do you have money for a new business?

188
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:02,240
We can't keep running at a loss.

189
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,790
Don't think that.

190
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,300
We've had that cleaner's for 20 years.

191
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,770
What else will we do?

192
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,970
Yes.

193
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,060
You should focus your energy into one project.

194
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,330
I'm home.

195
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,190
- Hey.
- You're home.

196
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,640
Did you eat?

197
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:18,240
Suim bought me a great dinner.

198
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,730
And we even saw a movie.

199
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,390
It's hard to believe you fought yesterday.

200
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:26,190
Their fights don't even last long.

201
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,730
That's how it is with sisters.

202
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,160
It's like cutting a radish with a knife.

203
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,830
Isn't it cutting water with a knife?

204
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,260
It's tough to cut a radish with a knife.

205
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,900
Why do you have to be so critical?

206
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,100
You don't have to be.

207
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,260
Everyone understood me.

208
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,640
That's true.

209
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,870
Didn't you have auditions today?

210
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,960
Did you do well?

211
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,830
Well...

212
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,060
My voice gave out in the end but

213
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,440
I can do better next time.

214
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:57,800
I knew it. You came home so late.

215
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:01,440
You weren't taking care of yourself.

216
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,940
Why don't you go rest?

217
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,770
Goodnight.

218
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,300
What is it?

219
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,140
I'm a little dizzy.

220
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,360
You have a fever.

221
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,390
What if you have the flu again?

222
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,270
Why did you stay out so late?

223
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,190
I'm okay.

224
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,690
Take her to her room.

225
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,770
Let's go.

226
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,460
She's upset over the auditions.

227
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,690
She won't get the lead?

228
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,740
Why didn't you come home sooner?

229
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,630
Why did you stay out in the cold?

230
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,970
I didn't know she was sick.

231
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,130
I would've brought her home.

232
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,690
I wanted to stay out late.

233
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,060
I'm okay.

234
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,190
Your father won't forgive you if you do this to yourself.

235
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,270
You have to take care of your health if you don't want him yelling at you.

236
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,330
Okay.

237
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,190
This looks like the flu.

238
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,900
Let's get her a fever reducer.

239
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,870
Go see a doctor tomorrow.

240
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,030
Okay.

241
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,640
I want to sleep now.

242
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:08,530
Why are you both giving me such a hard time?

243
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,830
I'll go get some medicine.

244
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,860
Who is that?

245
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,190
It's my friend.

246
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,230
Why is she calling at this hour?

247
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,560
Yeah, it's me.

248
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:34,540
This is Gu Sejun.

249
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,800
I know who you are, girl.

250
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,370
Why are you calling at this hour?

251
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:40,440
Your kids must be there.

252
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,300
Yes.

253
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,540
It's cold, so go inside.

254
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,970
May I ask why you called?

255
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:55,440
I wanted to hear your voice.

256
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,800
We used to talk as parent and teacher.

257
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:02,560
Yes.

258
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:08,990
It feels strange to talk to you like this.

259
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,800
Yes.

260
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:17,600
Yeah, let's meet up sometime.

261
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,190
I'm a little busy these days.

262
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,490
Bye.

263
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,790
Goodbye, Jeongja.

264
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,830
Goodbye.

265
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,440
Who was that?

266
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,900
You scared me.

267
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,690
Don't you know how to knock?

268
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,300
I did, but you didn't hear me.

269
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,770
Who was that? The Witch?

270
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,170
No.

271
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,640
And stop calling her that.

272
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,340
Who was that?

273
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,800
You kept your voice low.

274
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,170
It must have been a woman.

275
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,670
Do you have someone else already?

276
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,060
It's not what you think.

277
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,800
I knew it!

278
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:54,960
I don't care who she is as long as she's not the Witch.

279
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,630
I told you not to call her that.

280
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,300
Mom says to come out and have some fruit.

281
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,360
I'm home.

282
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,760
Son, you're here.

283
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,900
Hi. I'm going to my room.

284
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,870
Taegyeong, come here.

285
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,130
What is it?

286
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,470
It's about Hyeonu.

287
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,990
Does he like someone else?

288
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,000
Who told you?

289
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,290
I guess it's true.

290
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:21,270
I told you!

291
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,800
Who is she?

292
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,770
Why do you want to know?

293
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:29,130
Don't fall for Suim again because of this.

294
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,270
I don't want you to be with her.

295
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,940
You don't know what might happen.

296
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,900
This is about pride.

297
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,370
You have to marry up.

298
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,490
To someone better than Suim.

299
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,960
I'll make her pay for what she did to you.

300
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,670
Why does your pride matter in this?

301
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,190
This is about his marriage.

302
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,140
His feelings are what matters.

303
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:51,100
I'm doing this for his own good.

304
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,760
Suim has to regret refusing him.

305
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:59,330
I don't like that you're saying this.

306
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:03,730
He's busy with his new performance.

307
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,630
Oh.

308
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:08,960
Did you set a date with Ms. An?

309
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:09,900
Yes.

310
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,640
It's next Saturday.

311
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,570
Listen.

312
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,940
I told you I'm breaking up with her.

313
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,670
For that divorcee?

314
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,800
Will you stop calling her that?

315
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,490
She has a name.

316
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,900
What is it?

317
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:26,340
How is her name important?

318
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,370
To me, she'll always be known as divorcee.

319
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,640
Honey.

320
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:32,400
She comes from a painful past.

321
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,300
That would be rude.

322
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,560
And it's common to get a divorce these days.

323
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,500
I wouldn't say this to anyone else.

324
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,790
But my own brother wants to marry one.

325
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,560
I can't help the way I feel.

326
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:50,640
It wouldn't be fair for Ms. An to keep seeing a shell of a man.

327
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:53,730
I'm not going to be with her.

328
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,900
You won't get away this easy.

329
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,230
You hear me?

330
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:04,400
You think you can be with that woman in spite of mom?

331
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,690
In high school, kids called me the Bulldozer.

332
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,840
I've still got it.

333
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,140
I can't wait to see you in action.

334
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:14,900
Is Hyeonu not going to give Suim a chance?

335
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,100
No.

336
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,900
But Suim liked Hyeonu so much.

337
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:21,460
Would it be okay if she came to you?

338
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,900
She's the one I like.

339
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,570
I don't care who she liked.

340
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,800
I care that I like her.

341
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,730
That matters more to me.

342
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,960
Suim's such a fool.

343
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,640
She doesn't know what she has.

344
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:07,900
I'm not coming back to the theater.

345
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,940
We'll never see each other again.

346
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,490
What's wrong, Deulim?

347
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,960
Did you have a bad dream?

348
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,230
Suim...

349
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,900
Are you in pain?

350
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,960
No...

351
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,840
- Breakfast is ready.
- All right.

352
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,530
Didn't Hyeonu come home last night?

353
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,630
He had some paperwork to go over.

354
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,900
He called to say he'll be working late.

355
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,260
Is everything okay?

356
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,060
Yes. Don't worry.

357
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,040
Why don't you go check on him later?

358
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,840
I'm going to take him a change of clothes.

359
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,270
I'll take that.

360
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:58,590
I'll drop by on my way to work.

361
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,300
I can go instead.

362
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,170
Let's eat.

363
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,260
Is Deulim up?

364
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,060
Didn't you see her leave?

365
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,140
Did she leave?

366
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,670
I thought she was in bed.

367
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,100
She was gone when I got up.

368
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:17,300
But she's not feeling well.

369
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,860
I'll stop by to see her later.

370
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,190
Okay.

371
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,740
Suim.

372
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,590
Yes?

373
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:29,060
Did you find out about the guy she's seeing?

374
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,400
No. I've been busy lately.

375
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:38,690
What if Deulim got sick from going on late night dates with that boy?

376
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,230
I don't think so.

377
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,500
She's been at the theater rehearsing for the auditions.

378
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,530
Okay. Get ready for work.

379
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,830
Okay.

380
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,800
You're here already.

381
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,000
Hey.

382
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,860
Didn't you go home last night?

383
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,400
No. I stayed here.

384
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,940
You slept here?

385
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,870
I had a drink.

386
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,460
And I didn't want to go home.

387
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,140
But you should have.

388
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,140
Your family must have been worried.

389
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:41,940
They'll only worry about me getting injured.

390
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,840
When my heart's already broken.

391
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,540
All this over a girl?

392
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,760
I feel so powerless.

393
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,630
I feel like a useless person.

394
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,840
Hyeonu.

395
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,970
Hello.

396
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,170
Dad.

397
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,490
Is everything okay?

398
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,670
Yes.

399
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,960
But you should sleep at home.

400
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,670
I brought you some clothes.

401
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,830
Change. I'll be outside.

402
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,800
Have a seat.

403
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,690
Is this hard for you?

404
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:27,260
Do you hate me?

405
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,640
I made you a lawyer when you wanted to get into musicals.

406
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,900
And I want you to marry Suim.

407
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:40,690
I know this may come as a burden.

408
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,140
But Hyeonu.

409
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,260
Yes?

410
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,690
When you become a father,

411
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,400
you want certain things for your son.

412
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,860
I wanted you to follow in my footsteps.

413
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,940
I wanted to validate my life that way.

414
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:02,600
Dad.

415
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:05,600
Which is why I was strict with you

416
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,740
every time you strayed from the path.

417
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:12,760
I don't know if that was hard on you

418
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:17,560
but I've always wanted the best for you.

419
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:21,670
You're to follow in my footsteps.

420
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:25,990
You're too young to know now,

421
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,800
but it's rewarding to live as a man of the law.

422
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,560
You'll find out soon.

423
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:38,730
You said you wanted to do just things.

424
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:42,560
Not everyone can practice that in society.

425
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,740
You were born with great character.

426
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,730
And you need someone who can

427
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,640
understand you and hold your hand.

428
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:55,730
That's how you can do the right thing.

429
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,460
But I can't be with Suim.

430
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,290
Try to look at her good qualities.

431
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,060
That's how you can approach her.

432
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,200
Dad.

433
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,100
Don't sleep out. Sleep at home.

434
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:10,630
Your grandfather will worry.

435
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,190
Are you leaving?

436
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,600
Yes.

437
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:28,040
He slept in the office last night.

438
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,400
He had a bit to drink so he felt sorry about going home.

439
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:36,760
There's a good place in this building that sells really good stew.

440
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,460
I'll get him some.

441
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,360
Try to be understanding of Hyeonu's behavior.

442
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:48,900
I told you this before but you're the only one who can help him.

443
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,260
Don't get weak.

444
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,440
Do you understand?

445
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,090
I'm sorry.

446
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:57,000
You trust in me

447
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,870
but I may not be enough.

448
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:02,490
Don't say that.

449
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,260
I wouldn't know how to face you.

450
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,500
Father.

451
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:12,170
Go back to work then.

452
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,070
Hello.

453
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,730
I need to ask you something.

454
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,900
I was going to ask to see you.

455
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,760
Have a seat.

456
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:31,860
Do you want something to drink?

457
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,900
Actually, I...

458
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:37,230
Tell me the truth.

459
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:42,340
Is Sejun seeing that woman he was with before?

460
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,370
Of course not.

461
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,440
That can't ever happen.

462
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:54,230
Why did Sejun say he doesn't want to see me anymore?

463
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,960
He's never had a real girlfriend.

464
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,030
He doesn't know how to express himself.

465
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:03,340
I thought that was it at first but I don't believe that anymore.

466
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:05,970
You know how a woman has a sixth sense.

467
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,730
Don't worry about that.

468
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:12,790
I'll drag him to the family meeting if i have to.

469
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,730
Just bring your parents.

470
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,760
Okay. I'll trust you.

471
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,030
Please do.

472
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:27,670
Sejun! Just wait till we're married!

473
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,370
I'll get you for this!

474
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:40,370
I'm sorry I have to keep saying no.

475
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,340
That's okay.

476
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:45,690
I have 97 times left.

477
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,900
Sejun.

478
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:50,070
Ms. An.

479
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:53,330
Hello.

480
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:55,000
Hello.

481
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,760
What are you doing with Sejun?

482
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,360
Ms. An, I...

483
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,400
No other reason.

484
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:09,960
We were discussing my son.

485
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,990
Is he in trouble?

486
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,230
He's not getting into trouble anymore.

487
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,940
He's behaving well now.

488
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,600
Goodbye.

489
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,370
What's left?

490
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,460
What did you mean by 97 times?

491
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:31,290
Yes, I...

492
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:35,060
You're not in...

493
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,560
She didn't borrow money from you, did she?

494
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,670
What?

495
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,240
I don't know what that means.

496
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,790
Where were you?

497
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,130
I was with your sister.

498
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:51,800
I told her everything.

499
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,090
That's fine.

500
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:56,670
You can do whatever you need to do to make yourself feel better.

501
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,530
Do you promise?

502
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,860
Yes.

503
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,670
All right.

504
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,600
I'll see you on Saturday.

505
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:10,170
Oh, I meant excluding that.

506
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:15,490
This is the information on the theater Sanghyeon wants to purchase.

507
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,860
Let's look it over.

508
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,130
They made almost no money last year.

509
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:25,490
I didn't think the finances were this bad.

510
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,940
What are you doing here?

511
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:32,640
I wanted to ask you something.

512
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,300
Do I have to excuse myself?

513
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,130
No, it's about Sanghyeon.

514
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,340
Sit.

515
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,630
What about him?

516
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,730
I heard he's about to buy a theater.

517
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:49,190
You're advising him?

518
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,290
Yeah.

519
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,990
You know what that theater means.

520
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,960
How can an investment company but up a theater like that?

521
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:07,370
But you two are helping him with the acquisition?

522
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,640
Yeah.

523
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:13,190
The theater has no other options.

524
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,100
Even if they need the money,

525
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:20,290
you can't ask them to change the CEO and the whole cast.

526
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,760
How can you be the face of this?

527
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:25,260
I worried about that, too,

528
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,360
but I decided to do as Sanghyeon wants.

529
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:31,030
That's all I can do.

530
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,460
Hyeonu.

531
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,600
If I say no to this,

532
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,870
Sanghyeon will go to another lawyer.

533
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,730
And he'll get what he wants.

534
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,490
The outcome will be the same regardless.

535
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,670
How is that the same?

536
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,730
You'll feel horrible after this is over.

537
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,960
Horrible?

538
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,860
Will that change anything?

539
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,600
Even if I feel guilty?

540
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,830
This isn't right.

541
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,970
I have a headache.

542
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:04,030
Let's go have a drink.

543
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,330
Again?

544
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,440
It's still light out.

545
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:10,100
I thought we were done for the day.

546
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:12,270
You should go too.

547
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,460
Want to go?

548
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,760
I have work to do.

549
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,170
Then let's go.

550
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:26,290
Why do you look so awful?

551
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,140
I'm fine, so don't worry.

552
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:34,230
Give the acquisition another thought.

553
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,670
Or just walk away.

554
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:40,470
I have to take this so I can give more benefits to the theater.

555
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,060
Drop this.

556
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,590
How did the auditions go?

557
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:49,670
Fine...

558
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,290
I guess Suim didn't tell you.

559
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,230
She told me to tell you.

560
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,060
What?

561
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,670
Deulim made a mistake.

562
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,670
Mistake?

563
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,460
She wasn't feeling well.

564
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,330
And the results?

565
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:05,970
Her scores were the lowest.

566
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,940
How can it be that bad?

567
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,170
Everyone else worked hard.

568
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,800
Oh.

569
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,960
She told me she'd do well.

570
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,640
She came today but

571
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,400
she seemed really weak.

572
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:33,000
This is Deulim Cleaner's.

573
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,640
Who?

574
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:44,060
I've been telling myself I should apologize after what happened at the family meeting.

575
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,570
Don't worry about the past.

576
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,990
I taught Suim myself at the judicial institute.

577
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,590
I see.

578
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:57,600
She has a great character.

579
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:00,690
She was flawless.

580
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,640
I could tell she grew up well.

581
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:06,840
Thank you for saying that.

582
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:09,800
I've always kept one eye on her.

583
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:14,090
And I learned that she and my son went to the same college.

584
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,490
I knew this was meant to be.

585
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:25,070
I want Suim to be my daughter in law.

586
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,070
Let's be in-laws.

587
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:33,640
I know you're fond of my girl.

588
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:38,670
I wanted to thank you for being so kind.

589
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,060
I'm sorry this is coming so late.

590
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:47,490
But a marriage can't happen because the parents want it to.

591
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,190
There are a lot of problems.

592
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,140
I know you're very disappointed in my son.

593
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:56,690
But Suim's so strong.

594
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,490
If we're patient enough,

595
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,560
I know this will end well.

596
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,200
I don't know.

597
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:08,640
I don't want to tell my daughter to be patient any longer.

598
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,900
Sir.

599
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:12,940
A marriage isn't easy, even if the kids like one another.

600
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:16,260
Which is why...

601
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:21,490
I don't think I can tell my daughter to marry your son.

602
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,800
Please.

603
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,330
Sir, please be patient with us.

604
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:33,670
I'm sorry this had to end.

605
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,100
Excuse me.

606
00:32:54,800 --> 00:33:00,640
I said I'd never see you again but I came back. I'm drunk.

607
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,990
Don't drink.

608
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:11,090
Deulim.

609
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,960
Can't we be together?

610
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:22,570
Don't you think you can fight this with me?

611
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:26,740
You said you'd trust me.

612
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,300
You said you'll stay with me.

613
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,290
You said you won't give me up.

614
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,960
Don't.

615
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,360
Why are you doing this?

616
00:33:48,500 --> 00:34:00,370
I didn't want to see you again but I couldn't help it.

617
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,460
I feel like if I drink again,

618
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:07,530
I'd end up here again.

619
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:23,970
What is she doing in the street?

620
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:30,360
Don't do this. Go home.

621
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,230
Deulim?

622
00:34:43,420 --> 00:35:02,500
