3
00:00:06,552 --> 00:00:08,433
Seriously, it came out again.

4
00:00:08,433 --> 00:00:11,836
See, you threw out this hair clip
for no reason and it's all bent now!

5
00:00:13,648 --> 00:00:15,355
Seriously...

6
00:00:15,355 --> 00:00:16,827
Hand it over.

7
00:00:19,675 --> 00:00:21,257
Come over here.

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,845
Did it work?

9
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,255
But... about that story of the Little
Mermaid you mentioned yesterday.

10
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:49,165
Does it really end like that?

11
00:00:50,276 --> 00:00:54,666
To my knowledge, the Little Mermaid
doesn't disappear into sea foam bubbles.

12
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:01,044
The Prince can't remember,
so what can you do?

13
00:01:07,054 --> 00:01:09,167
How would you have
liked it to end then?

14
00:01:11,122 --> 00:01:12,404
Me?

15
00:01:31,085 --> 00:01:33,251
Hey, hurry up!
The boat came in!

16
00:01:39,045 --> 00:01:41,743
People must be waiting. Let's go.

17
00:01:56,098 --> 00:01:58,052
About that Little Mermaid
story earlier...

18
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,107
I remembered how it ended.

19
00:02:03,737 --> 00:02:06,162
How... does it end?

20
00:02:16,567 --> 00:02:19,367
'The moment the Little Mermaid
turns into sea foam bubbles...'

21
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:26,271
'The Prince's memory...'

returned.'

23
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,389
Shouldn't fairytales
usually end like that?

24
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:47,818
A happy ending.

25
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:50,157
People don't know fairytales very well.

26
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:56,531
Soo In, when did you get here?

27
00:02:56,531 --> 00:02:58,763
- Just now.
- Let's go.

28
00:03:12,705 --> 00:03:14,395
Are you all right?

29
00:03:17,343 --> 00:03:19,287
Yes.

30
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:22,047
I'm sorry to have made
you worry over nothing.

31
00:03:23,721 --> 00:03:25,669
Not at all. Let's go.

32
00:03:37,822 --> 00:03:40,399
That's right. It isn't over yet.

33
00:03:40,851 --> 00:03:43,924
Snap out of it, Park Soo In.

34
00:03:49,686 --> 00:03:51,720
- This way.
- Yes.

35
00:03:54,896 --> 00:03:58,707
President Jo!
Let's have dinner together.

36
00:03:58,707 --> 00:04:00,792
I have something to
tell you as well.

37
00:04:26,204 --> 00:04:28,124
Let's eat.

38
00:04:28,892 --> 00:04:32,731
- Did you find what you lost?
- Yes, I did.

39
00:04:33,445 --> 00:04:35,702
What was it that you
were in such a hurry?

40
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,339
This is all because of that
hair clip you bought her.

41
00:04:40,563 --> 00:04:43,866
Spend money if you're going
to buy a present for your girlfriend.

42
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,245
How countrified.

43
00:04:51,217 --> 00:04:53,047
Go on, eat.

44
00:04:59,074 --> 00:05:00,579
What?

45
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:02,993
Is it the first time you've seen
someone wrap eel in lettuce?

46
00:05:04,109 --> 00:05:05,878
It's delicious wrapped
in sesame leaf as well.

47
00:05:05,878 --> 00:05:09,262
President Jo. I told you that
I had something to tell you.

48
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,738
Joon Hyun and I are getting engaged.

49
00:05:15,972 --> 00:05:18,344
I felt like you should know
ahead of time.

50
00:05:19,623 --> 00:05:23,840
We're planning a quiet occasion
without letting the press know.

51
00:05:25,273 --> 00:05:27,842
Yes well... that's
something to celebrate.

52
00:05:27,842 --> 00:05:30,046
Congratulations.

53
00:05:38,435 --> 00:05:41,993
Did I... do something wrong
by bringing up the engagement party?

54
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:49,289
I'm sorry for deciding that
on my own without consulting you.

55
00:05:50,575 --> 00:05:53,707
No, it's okay. Let's go.

56
00:06:08,527 --> 00:06:10,003
You're going to go home, right?

57
00:06:11,618 --> 00:06:14,471
No, I'll go to the practice studio.

58
00:06:15,928 --> 00:06:18,056
I'd like for you to rest at home today.

59
00:06:19,551 --> 00:06:23,041
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

60
00:06:27,438 --> 00:06:29,396
You don't have to be like that
in front of me.

61
00:06:29,396 --> 00:06:31,213
Do whatever you want.

62
00:06:31,213 --> 00:06:33,068
Don't hold it in.

<i>Joon Hyun and I are getting engaged.</i>

64
00:07:20,532 --> 00:07:24,138
Joon Hyun and I are getting engaged.

65
00:07:26,611 --> 00:07:28,467
Found it!

66
00:07:46,631 --> 00:07:49,951
We found this at the crime scene.
Is this yours?

67
00:07:56,713 --> 00:07:58,649
- Tae Song.
<i>- Where are you right now?</i>

68
00:07:59,727 --> 00:08:02,505
I'm on my way to hand my cellphone
to a repair shop...

69
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:05,295
Never mind. I'll go myself.

70
00:08:07,299 --> 00:08:10,201
It'll take some time to recover
the videos.

71
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:12,706
I'll contact you.

72
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:20,766
He isn't here.

<i>Customer, were you happy
with your service?</i>

75
00:08:47,921 --> 00:08:53,076
<i>We'll contact you when the phone
you gave us is repaired. Thank you.</i>

76
00:08:54,603 --> 00:08:56,115
He gave them a cellphone to repair?

77
00:08:56,115 --> 00:08:58,526
But this is his cellphone.

78
00:08:59,682 --> 00:09:02,240
No way...

79
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:09,169
- You're here?
- You're here.

80
00:09:12,872 --> 00:09:14,794
These are the locations for
our engagement party.

81
00:09:14,794 --> 00:09:16,348
Why don't you choose.

82
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,876
I think this one is run down
despite it being popular...

83
00:09:19,318 --> 00:09:21,886
What? He already picked it up?

84
00:09:21,886 --> 00:09:24,307
Jang Joon Hyun picked up
his cellphone in person.

85
00:09:27,403 --> 00:09:29,154
Are you all right?

86
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,807
Why didn't I think of
that cellphone earlier?

87
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:39,586
It's all over if he looks
at that cellphone!

88
00:09:39,586 --> 00:09:41,920
It'll have pictures of them
together and everything!

89
00:09:42,711 --> 00:09:45,319
What do we do now?
What are we going to do?

90
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:47,433
Calm down.
Your engagement's coming up soon.

91
00:09:48,873 --> 00:09:50,328
I'll take care of the cellphone.

92
00:09:50,328 --> 00:09:52,175
You trust me, don't you?

[Lee Hwa Soon: LA Address]

94
00:10:07,213 --> 00:10:09,397
Hello?

95
00:10:09,397 --> 00:10:11,971
Is this Hwa Soon?
It's me, Yang Joo Hee.

96
00:10:14,303 --> 00:10:16,348
Right, it's been a while.

97
00:10:16,348 --> 00:10:20,298
Did you hear? That Joon Hyun
and Soo In are getting engaged?

98
00:10:20,298 --> 00:10:23,089
Goodness, you didn't know?

99
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:27,184
These are all the albums
Shine Star produced.

100
00:10:27,184 --> 00:10:31,621
Should I call it a
kind of honorary hall?

101
00:10:32,295 --> 00:10:34,638
Wow.

102
00:10:34,638 --> 00:10:36,058
Choose one.

103
00:10:36,058 --> 00:10:40,330
See if there's a record that
could be your role model.

104
00:10:47,807 --> 00:10:50,287
What if you put out a ballad?

105
00:10:51,021 --> 00:10:52,052
What?

106
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,259
There's no rule saying
you have to stick to trot.

107
00:10:55,308 --> 00:10:57,639
Think about it.
There are a lot of options.

109
00:11:08,956 --> 00:11:10,917
Yes, Soo In.

110
00:11:11,864 --> 00:11:14,120
Our engagement party
invitations came today.

111
00:11:18,406 --> 00:11:21,460
Who would you invite from Shine Star?

112
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,916
I was going to ask my mom first.

113
00:11:27,749 --> 00:11:29,998
Choon Hee.

114
00:11:34,242 --> 00:11:38,520
Our engagement party is on Monday.
You can come, right?

115
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:43,261
We shouldn't do that.
How about you sing a celebratory song?

116
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:47,795
We can quiet down the rumors
between the three of us that way.

117
00:11:47,795 --> 00:11:50,452
- Soo In.
- I have an event that day.

118
00:12:09,381 --> 00:12:11,551
I'm sorry.

119
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:14,924
About what?

120
00:12:14,937 --> 00:12:16,372
Asking you to sing
a celebratory song.

121
00:12:28,378 --> 00:12:30,314
Are you happy?

122
00:12:34,483 --> 00:12:37,410
What reason would I have...
not to be?

123
00:12:46,242 --> 00:12:49,077
That's enough then.

124
00:12:54,555 --> 00:12:56,971
I gave out all the invitations.

125
00:12:56,971 --> 00:12:59,338
I promised to give them
a call the day before...

126
00:12:59,338 --> 00:13:01,519
- Soo In?
- Yeah?

127
00:13:02,963 --> 00:13:05,806
Don't misunderstand what
I'm going to say and just listen.

128
00:13:07,638 --> 00:13:11,231
There's something I need to confirm...
before the engagement party.

129
00:13:11,231 --> 00:13:13,412
So about that...

130
00:13:13,412 --> 00:13:15,725
Couldn't we postpone
the engagement party?

131
00:13:16,456 --> 00:13:18,619
- Joon Hyun.
- No, it's that...

132
00:13:18,619 --> 00:13:21,536
- It's not because of something else...
- Is there another woman?

133
00:13:21,536 --> 00:13:23,040
Huh?

134
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,131
Tell me the truth.

135
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,682
It's not like that.

136
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,770
That's enough then.

137
00:13:33,174 --> 00:13:38,791
Joon Hyun. After a sudden accident
and losing your memory...

138
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,858
I understand that you're probably
really confused lately.

139
00:13:42,945 --> 00:13:46,002
Let's try a little harder, okay?

140
00:13:46,512 --> 00:13:49,769
And...

141
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,806
Thanks.

142
00:13:52,806 --> 00:13:58,214
You saved me at the concert hall.
I won't ever forget that.

143
00:13:58,214 --> 00:14:01,142
I wanted to make sure
that I told you these words.

144
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:20,094
What's all this?

145
00:14:20,094 --> 00:14:21,727
Son!

146
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:26,316
Oh, my son! Have you been well?

147
00:14:26,316 --> 00:14:28,834
Mom. Why did you come here?

148
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:32,488
What do you mean? Should I not come
even if my son's getting engaged?

149
00:14:32,488 --> 00:14:37,067
Yang Joo... I mean,
Soo In's mother called me.

150
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:39,537
My impressive son.

151
00:14:41,895 --> 00:14:45,985
How long has it been, Hwa Soon?
You haven't changed.

152
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:49,390
I always look the same.
But you've seemed to age.

153
00:14:52,122 --> 00:14:54,604
- We're both getting older.
- 'We'?

154
00:14:54,604 --> 00:14:59,104
Oh dear, there are people asking me
if I'm in my twenties in the States.

155
00:15:01,032 --> 00:15:03,731
Mother, we're seeing each other
after quite a while.

156
00:15:03,731 --> 00:15:06,305
- Do you remember me?
- Oh yes, Soo In.

157
00:15:07,512 --> 00:15:09,692
It's the first time seeing each other
since you were young, right?

158
00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:13,977
- How pretty you've grown up to be.
- Thank you.

159
00:15:13,977 --> 00:15:16,202
But who's going to pay for the house?

160
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,372
- House?
- The house the kids will live in.

161
00:15:20,372 --> 00:15:23,195
Shouldn't you have
prepared one if you're

162
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:26,042
getting Joon Hyun
as a son-in-law?

163
00:15:36,115 --> 00:15:38,991
[Soo In]

164
00:15:51,621 --> 00:15:54,201
Are you happy?

165
00:16:03,828 --> 00:16:07,949
Jang Joon Hyun and Park Soo In
are getting engaged today.

166
00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:11,319
What? Jang Joon Hyun
and Park Soo In?

167
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:19,186
Per your instructions, I also
looked into Yang Joo Hee.

168
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,022
Is that right?

169
00:16:43,453 --> 00:16:46,531
You have to go back to your owner now.

170
00:16:52,148 --> 00:16:57,045
Right. You at least have to stay
by Jang Joon Hyun's side.

171
00:16:58,994 --> 00:17:01,278
I'll miss you.

172
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:23,776
It was here.

173
00:17:33,582 --> 00:17:37,153
<i>I'll make sure to find
your guitar for you. Choon Hee.</i>

174
00:17:50,553 --> 00:17:55,354
Goodness, President Jo.
What brings you?

175
00:17:55,904 --> 00:17:58,201
Were you responsible
for the scandal

176
00:17:58,214 --> 00:18:00,522
between Choi Choon Hee
and the politician?

177
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,218
Excuse me?

178
00:18:03,218 --> 00:18:05,297
Choi Choon Hee is a singer
I told you to train.

179
00:18:05,297 --> 00:18:07,991
But you fed her to the wolves
like that, Director Yang?

180
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,851
What was your reason for that?

181
00:18:12,851 --> 00:18:16,530
I don't know what you're talking about.

182
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,392
I don't know what
you've heard...

183
00:18:19,405 --> 00:18:22,278
Did you know Choon Hee
is Sung Joo's daughter?

184
00:18:23,065 --> 00:18:25,782
I have a debt to Oh Sung Joo.

185
00:18:26,337 --> 00:18:30,358
I'll take care of Choi Choon Hee
until her father returns.

186
00:18:30,358 --> 00:18:32,517
I'm warning you, Director Yang.

187
00:18:32,517 --> 00:18:36,869
If you mess with Choi Choon Hee
one more time...

188
00:18:38,037 --> 00:18:41,087
I won't stand for it.

189
00:18:50,981 --> 00:18:56,371
President Jo just came by.

190
00:18:56,371 --> 00:18:58,401
He claims to know everything
about Choi Choon Hee.

191
00:18:58,401 --> 00:19:00,261
It's okay.

192
00:19:00,261 --> 00:19:06,132
If this gets out, then let's take
care of Choi Choon Hee for good.

193
00:19:15,518 --> 00:19:19,036
Jang Joon Hyun?

194
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,748
Someone asked me to deliver this to you.

195
00:19:26,703 --> 00:19:30,223
Who... dropped this off?

196
00:19:30,223 --> 00:19:33,434
A woman dropped by not too long ago
and asked me to give this to you.

197
00:19:33,434 --> 00:19:35,721
- A woman?
- Yes.

198
00:20:12,834 --> 00:20:14,500
Choi Choon Hee?

199
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,866
Choi Choon Hee!

200
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:38,717
Choi Choon Hee!

201
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,258
Choi Choon Hee!

202
00:20:48,703 --> 00:20:50,639
Choi Choon Hee!

203
00:20:53,394 --> 00:20:55,394
Choi Choon Hee!

204
00:20:58,498 --> 00:21:02,774
Choi Choon Hee!

205
00:21:28,074 --> 00:21:30,129
Are you awake now?

206
00:21:33,968 --> 00:21:35,446
Choi Choon Hee.

207
00:21:35,446 --> 00:21:37,342
What about Choi Choon Hee?

208
00:21:41,302 --> 00:21:44,056
She's asleep.
She'll wake up soon.

209
00:21:47,986 --> 00:21:50,810
She'll be fine once she's stabilized.

210
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,044
Neither of you have to worry.

211
00:22:17,364 --> 00:22:22,768
<i>I want to say that I love you</i>

212
00:22:22,768 --> 00:22:29,090
<i>Just riding on this wish</i>

213
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,965
<i>Afraid that you might leave</i>

214
00:22:31,965 --> 00:22:32,087
- Choi Choon Hee.
- Hmm?
<i>Afraid that you might leave</i>

215
00:22:32,087 --> 00:22:34,079
- Choi Choon Hee.
- Hmm?

216
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:36,638
Sorry.

217
00:22:56,527 --> 00:22:58,542
Are you okay?

218
00:22:59,269 --> 00:23:01,369
Huh?

219
00:23:01,948 --> 00:23:04,784
I was a bit late, wasn't I?

220
00:23:31,299 --> 00:23:33,627
It's yours, Choi Choon Hee.

221
00:23:39,325 --> 00:23:41,125
- Over there.
- Joon Hyun!

222
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:43,755
Joon Hyun!

223
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,124
Goodness, my son!

224
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:49,367
Son, what happened?
I heard you were in an accident!

225
00:23:49,367 --> 00:23:51,934
- Don't worry, I'm fine.
- Are you really okay?

226
00:23:51,934 --> 00:23:56,582
Yeah. But how did you know
that I was here?

227
00:23:56,582 --> 00:23:58,308
I tried calling and
the nurse picked up.

228
00:23:58,308 --> 00:24:02,181
But Joon Hyun, who were you
in such a rush to see?

229
00:24:02,181 --> 00:24:03,885
Huh?

230
00:24:03,885 --> 00:24:07,636
A friend who lives far away came by
and left without a word.

231
00:24:07,636 --> 00:24:09,859
I went looking for that friend, and...

232
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:13,725
But now the engagement party is ruined
because of me. What will you do?

233
00:24:13,725 --> 00:24:15,529
Is that the issue right now?

234
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:17,357
We can reschedule
the engagement party.

235
00:24:17,357 --> 00:24:19,637
You should be getting better right now.

236
00:24:19,637 --> 00:24:21,855
Still, what a relief.

237
00:24:21,855 --> 00:24:26,868
Someone was complaining because they
didn't know you were in an accident...

238
00:24:28,739 --> 00:24:31,351
What a relief. Oh, my son.

239
00:24:31,351 --> 00:24:35,552
In any case, nothing good
can come from Yang Joo Hee's family.

240
00:24:35,552 --> 00:24:38,693
Like that accident on stage
and today's accident, too...

241
00:24:38,693 --> 00:24:41,278
What's going on?

242
00:24:43,922 --> 00:24:47,321
Figures, in Sung Joo's accident too...

243
00:24:48,638 --> 00:24:50,378
There was an accident in the past?

244
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:55,076
No, my son. It was nothing at all.

245
00:25:14,435 --> 00:25:17,996
Now that our son-in-law is well,
we should continue with the engagement.

246
00:25:17,996 --> 00:25:22,636
You saved me at the concert.
I won't ever forget that.

247
00:25:26,165 --> 00:25:31,514
Even if this gets out, let's take care
of Choi Choon Hee for good next time.

248
00:26:10,316 --> 00:26:12,320
Are you awake now?

249
00:26:16,554 --> 00:26:19,336
You're looking for the man
that came in with you, right?

250
00:26:19,336 --> 00:26:21,792
- Singer Jang Joon Hyun.
- Was he really hurt?

251
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:23,966
- Did he look okay?
- He went back home earlier.

252
00:26:23,966 --> 00:26:27,991
It's a relief that
both of you are fine.

253
00:26:27,991 --> 00:26:30,073
Ah, yes.

254
00:26:33,574 --> 00:26:35,837
That guy has no loyalty.

255
00:26:35,837 --> 00:26:38,069
How can he just leave?

256
00:26:40,237 --> 00:26:43,875
But it's a relief to
hear that he's fine.

257
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,967
[Missed Call]

258
00:27:08,983 --> 00:27:11,238
You must be giving it
to your girlfriend.

259
00:27:12,412 --> 00:27:14,907
Who is it?

260
00:27:16,314 --> 00:27:18,224
It's President Jo!

261
00:27:22,827 --> 00:27:25,444
Here, a present for the Little Miss.

262
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:28,104
Wow, it's candy! Looks delicious!

263
00:27:37,126 --> 00:27:39,400
What? You don't like candy?

264
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,402
That's not it...

265
00:27:41,402 --> 00:27:43,716
This is a bribe.

266
00:27:43,716 --> 00:27:46,384
- Huh?
- I'm a fair person.

267
00:27:46,384 --> 00:27:49,570
I'm going to keep a firm boundary
with you and Joon Hyun.

268
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:52,607
I won't stand for it
if you cross it.

269
00:27:52,607 --> 00:27:55,291
Ah, so there was that problem!

270
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:59,241
That's right. How about this then?

271
00:27:59,241 --> 00:28:03,590
You eat this candy and also
eat the ones from that man!

272
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,559
That's fair then.

273
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:08,543
It's fair not to receive anything
from anyone

274
00:28:08,543 --> 00:28:10,970
but isn't it also fair to accept
gifts from both people?

275
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:13,147
- Isn't that right?
- Oh!

276
00:28:13,147 --> 00:28:15,062
All right, here.

277
00:28:20,313 --> 00:28:22,406
What's this?

278
00:28:22,898 --> 00:28:25,763
I have to hand it to these adults.

279
00:28:25,763 --> 00:28:28,829
You shouldn't joke around
with food!

280
00:28:28,829 --> 00:28:30,525
I really thought it was candy!

281
00:28:30,525 --> 00:28:33,113
The real candy's here!

282
00:28:40,805 --> 00:28:42,374
- Is it good?
- Yes.

283
00:28:45,578 --> 00:28:47,463
This is for your sister.
Chocolate.

284
00:28:47,463 --> 00:28:51,576
Wow, chocolate!
I really like chocolate!

285
00:28:51,576 --> 00:28:53,520
No, you can't eat this, Byul.

286
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,883
There's a bitter alcohol in here
that only adults can eat.

287
00:28:55,883 --> 00:28:58,245
- Liquor?
- Yeah.

288
00:28:58,245 --> 00:29:00,933
Your sister is probably having
a hard day today.

289
00:29:00,933 --> 00:29:05,885
Tell her to eat these and
have sweet dreams tonight.

290
00:29:05,885 --> 00:29:07,849
Got it?

291
00:29:07,849 --> 00:29:10,458
I think I know what you mean.

292
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,282
What?

293
00:29:22,282 --> 00:29:24,522
This competition has
gone on, but it feels

294
00:29:24,535 --> 00:29:26,786
like the other competitor
has withdrawn.

295
00:29:27,803 --> 00:29:29,854
Jang Joon Hyun didn't get engaged.

296
00:29:29,854 --> 00:29:32,675
- What?
- They're rescheduling it.

297
00:29:32,675 --> 00:29:35,203
In any case...

298
00:29:35,203 --> 00:29:39,048
You should probably
pull it more towards you, huh?

299
00:29:39,048 --> 00:29:44,845
So what I'm thinking, is to give you
a proper chance to act as my father.

300
00:29:44,845 --> 00:29:46,881
Huh?

301
00:29:56,097 --> 00:29:58,950
<i>Ji Sook, I'm sorry.</i>

302
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:03,021
<i>Because of my momentary passion,
I couldn't look at you.</i>

303
00:30:03,021 --> 00:30:06,654
<i>I'll just keep watch over you
from a distance.</i>

304
00:30:11,322 --> 00:30:12,579
Tae Song!

305
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:15,217
- Hi, Pil Nyeo.
- Have you been well?

306
00:30:15,217 --> 00:30:18,154
Look how much better you look
after being away for some time.

307
00:30:18,154 --> 00:30:22,663
It must make a difference. I feel
great and my skin feels good, too.

308
00:30:22,663 --> 00:30:27,299
Oh. Then you two went
on a trip together?

309
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:29,908
So you've officially
become a couple then?

310
00:30:29,908 --> 00:30:31,964
We've officially become a couple!

311
00:30:32,905 --> 00:30:35,350
Ji Sook!

312
00:30:36,579 --> 00:30:40,064
No, it's good.

313
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,811
Let's eat together.
Why are you eating alone?

314
00:30:44,811 --> 00:30:47,048
Should we order one more?

315
00:30:47,048 --> 00:30:49,862
- I'm... done. Done.
- You still have a lot left.

316
00:30:49,862 --> 00:30:51,697
You can't.

317
00:30:51,697 --> 00:30:53,642
- Goodbye.
- I'm leaving!

318
00:30:55,809 --> 00:30:57,981
They're embarrassed.

319
00:31:03,285 --> 00:31:04,561
Hi.

320
00:31:06,645 --> 00:31:08,874
I'm your top fan.

321
00:31:08,874 --> 00:31:13,143
- Hello.
- You're prettiest when you smile

322
00:31:13,143 --> 00:31:17,651
so why does your face look like it's
carrying all the burdens of the world?

323
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:24,916
Should we hold a fan meeting
to boost your spirits?

324
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:26,600
- A fan meeting?
- Yes.

325
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,735
Hi.

326
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:37,844
What? Are you worried because
it'll be expensive?

327
00:31:37,844 --> 00:31:40,086
Afraid I might ask you to pay?

328
00:31:40,086 --> 00:31:42,576
Of course not, of course not at all.

329
00:31:42,576 --> 00:31:46,673
I'm just kidding.
Over here.

330
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:54,700
President Jo.
What are you doing here?

331
00:31:56,318 --> 00:31:59,318
- I planned this with my father.
- Father...

332
00:31:59,318 --> 00:32:01,835
He's your father?

333
00:32:03,268 --> 00:32:05,336
- President Jo Hee Moon...
- Father.

334
00:32:05,336 --> 00:32:07,554
Goodness, oh my!

335
00:32:07,554 --> 00:32:10,921
There were so many things
I was curious about!

336
00:32:10,921 --> 00:32:14,879
I heard that you told Jang Joon Hyun
to train me.

337
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:17,393
But how did you know who I was?

338
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,965
I was the one who trained your mother.

339
00:32:19,965 --> 00:32:23,668
It was the first job I had
when I established Shine Star.

340
00:32:25,149 --> 00:32:32,149
Then the person who gave up
singing was... my mother?

341
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:33,717
That's right.

342
00:32:33,717 --> 00:32:37,736
Your mother was a great singer.

343
00:32:41,552 --> 00:32:43,730
But you knew about this too, President?

344
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:47,278
What? No, I just found out.

345
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:52,219
But Father, Choon Hee must take after
her mother's excellent singing talent.

346
00:32:52,219 --> 00:32:56,097
That's right. I sometimes
see Choon Hee's

347
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:59,998
mother in Choon Hee's
performances.

348
00:33:00,689 --> 00:33:04,798
How about you make your mother's dreams
come true, Choi Choon Hee?

349
00:33:13,786 --> 00:33:19,518
<i>Mom, I want to become
an impressive singer like you.</i>

350
00:33:22,139 --> 00:33:25,085
<i>You're going to help me
concentrate on singing, right?</i>

351
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:30,009
<i>I miss you.</i>

352
00:34:03,807 --> 00:34:06,073
Who is it?

353
00:34:07,239 --> 00:34:10,293
Is this Choi Choon Hee's...

354
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,727
Why are you at our house?

355
00:34:16,315 --> 00:34:17,763
Hey, Choi Choon Hee.

356
00:34:19,295 --> 00:34:22,878
Next time that happens,
don't get involved.

357
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:27,118
If you have to get involved...
then call me.

358
00:34:33,987 --> 00:34:35,363
Boo!

359
00:34:35,977 --> 00:34:38,179
Why I ought to just...

360
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,960
I feel better. Don't
you think of the

361
00:34:39,973 --> 00:34:41,764
person waiting at home
who made you food?

362
00:34:41,764 --> 00:34:44,852
- Hey, I'm sorry.
- Let's go.

363
00:34:44,852 --> 00:34:46,254
Agreed.

364
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:17,311
What brings you here?

365
00:35:38,814 --> 00:35:41,669
You dropped off my guitar
and left, didn't you?

366
00:35:41,669 --> 00:35:43,095
What was that?

367
00:35:43,095 --> 00:35:45,657
You entrusted that to me
when you were my manager.

368
00:35:45,657 --> 00:35:47,677
I entrusted that to you?

369
00:35:47,677 --> 00:35:49,737
I definitely gave that to the new...

370
00:35:49,737 --> 00:35:51,846
What?

371
00:35:51,846 --> 00:35:54,139
So what I'm saying is that

372
00:35:54,139 --> 00:35:57,121
it's a one of a kind so I wouldn't
have entrusted that to you.

373
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:59,543
I don't know your situation.

374
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:04,758
Anyhow, what happened
to your engagement party?

375
00:36:04,758 --> 00:36:06,964
We're going to reschedule it.

376
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:08,603
Good for you.

377
00:36:09,905 --> 00:36:12,127
How could you have run out like that?

378
00:36:12,127 --> 00:36:13,845
What if something even worse happened?

379
00:36:15,068 --> 00:36:17,294
You don't even have a pretty face.

380
00:36:17,294 --> 00:36:19,835
You'll probably look good
if you get a scar.

381
00:36:19,835 --> 00:36:20,976
Did you come all the
way here to say that?

382
00:36:20,989 --> 00:36:22,141
That's not it...

383
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,744
Ah, it's hot!

384
00:36:29,825 --> 00:36:31,757
What's going on?

385
00:36:31,757 --> 00:36:34,555
- Why doesn't the rotation work?
- It's broken.

386
00:36:34,555 --> 00:36:36,916
During the summer?

387
00:36:37,387 --> 00:36:39,574
You're really something.

388
00:36:57,935 --> 00:37:00,113
<i>[Six times for a big one!
four times for a small one!]</i>

389
00:37:14,223 --> 00:37:15,903
I'm leaving.

390
00:37:15,903 --> 00:37:18,041
You called me yesterday, didn't you?

391
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:21,157
- Yeah.
- How did you know my number?

392
00:37:21,157 --> 00:37:23,636
I asked Tae Song.

393
00:37:24,878 --> 00:37:26,615
Why did you call?

394
00:37:26,615 --> 00:37:29,027
That's because...

395
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:32,454
I wanted to say thanks.

396
00:37:34,301 --> 00:37:38,458
Thanks... for yesterday.

397
00:37:40,146 --> 00:37:42,253
I'm leaving.

398
00:37:54,316 --> 00:37:57,169
<i>Thanks, Choi Choon Hee.</i>

399
00:37:57,169 --> 00:38:01,486
<i>For saving me... and
for finding my guitar.</i>

400
00:38:07,528 --> 00:38:09,486
What are you talking about?

401
00:38:09,486 --> 00:38:13,492
It's not like we did anything!
Who's Park Soo In to bark out orders?

402
00:38:13,492 --> 00:38:15,466
She wants us to do
a homeless persons' event?

403
00:38:15,466 --> 00:38:17,400
Don't you think it's
too much, Chul Man?

404
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,980
Those people don't know
how to be grateful.

405
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:25,075
Forget all those people
who don't have a conscience!

406
00:38:29,532 --> 00:38:32,209
Choon Hee. What do you think?

407
00:38:33,909 --> 00:38:35,915
I want to do it.

408
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,922
I'll think of Dad,
and if he likes my

409
00:38:39,935 --> 00:38:43,068
song, then I think
I'll be strengthened.

410
00:38:43,068 --> 00:38:44,627
Okay, good.

411
00:38:44,627 --> 00:38:48,212
Chul Man, should we do
a dance this time, too?

412
00:38:48,212 --> 00:38:51,348
Of course. How could we not do one?

413
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:58,442
- Isn't that right, Ji Sook?
- You really are amazing, Chul Man.

414
00:38:58,442 --> 00:39:01,282
You're Choon Hee's manager
and her backup dancer.

415
00:39:01,282 --> 00:39:03,887
Do they call that 'a multi-player'?

416
00:39:05,334 --> 00:39:06,831
Goodness, look at me.

417
00:39:09,566 --> 00:39:11,999
Don't worry about the
chorus, Choon Hee.

418
00:39:11,999 --> 00:39:14,961
Tae Song, let's make sure
to practice and get it right this time.

419
00:39:14,961 --> 00:39:16,566
We have to match our lips.

420
00:39:16,566 --> 00:39:18,334
Like this and that,
they have to be in sync...

421
00:39:19,777 --> 00:39:21,886
Oh my endorphins.

422
00:39:21,886 --> 00:39:23,817
Thank you, everyone.

423
00:39:26,794 --> 00:39:28,345
- Tae Song.
- Huh?

424
00:39:31,629 --> 00:39:34,037
Pil Nyeo.

425
00:39:37,315 --> 00:39:38,458
Goodness.

426
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:41,374
P...Pil Nyeo...

427
00:39:44,546 --> 00:39:47,002
Pil Nyeo! Pil Nyeo!

428
00:39:48,885 --> 00:39:52,740
Good good! Your voice
just came through from behind you.

429
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,088
Now that you have your sound down.

430
00:39:55,088 --> 00:39:58,674
The 'feel' is very important in trot.

431
00:39:58,674 --> 00:40:00,552
'Feel.' Listen.

432
00:40:05,594 --> 00:40:09,880
<i>It was like this from the start.
I liked you</i>

433
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,882
<i>from the moment I first met you.</i>

434
00:40:13,882 --> 00:40:20,921
<i>Like a cold, I get feverish
and that's how I knew it was love.</i>

like a happy pigeon.</i>

439
00:40:45,267 --> 00:40:47,885
- Hello.
- Hello.

440
00:40:49,168 --> 00:40:51,588
I'm trusting you all today!
Let's get together!

441
00:40:51,588 --> 00:40:53,741
We're... we're really doing this, okay?

442
00:40:53,741 --> 00:40:56,351
Let's do our best and be serious.

443
00:40:56,351 --> 00:40:59,487
Start! Choi Choon Hee!
Choi Choon Hee! Fighting!

444
00:41:00,037 --> 00:41:02,039
- Fighting!
- I'm really nervous.

445
00:41:07,321 --> 00:41:09,506
Hello. I'm singer Choi Choon Hee.

446
00:41:09,506 --> 00:41:14,412
I'll be singing 'My Way'
for you all today.

447
00:41:14,412 --> 00:41:17,835
How noisy! It's hard enough
living as  it is!

448
00:41:17,835 --> 00:41:21,535
- We can't even eat in peace?
- That's right! Let us eat!

449
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:26,385
Mister, you're very tired, aren't you?

450
00:41:26,385 --> 00:41:29,982
I really had a hard time
making a living, too.

451
00:41:29,982 --> 00:41:34,296
But the thing about music...
is that it's a great strength.

452
00:41:34,296 --> 00:41:37,340
So if you give me just three minutes...

453
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:42,160
I want to be a small source
of strength for you all today.

454
00:41:42,674 --> 00:41:46,163
Could I sing just one song for you?
Thank you.

455
00:41:46,163 --> 00:41:49,074
Then I'll be singing 'My Way' for you!

456

<i>I thought that I came a long way.</i>

<i>I look back and you aren't there.</i>

458
00:42:14,113 --> 00:42:15,431
<i>- Not there!
- Not there!</i>

459
00:42:15,431 --> 00:42:20,121
<i>I really thought it would
rain hard.</i>

460
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:23,819
<i>But there wasn't any.</i>

461
00:42:23,819 --> 00:42:25,289
<i>- Wasn't any!
- Wasn't any!</i>

462
00:42:25,289 --> 00:42:29,890
<i>At first I wasn't afraid...</i>

463
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:34,769
<i>But that scaredy cat changed
after some time.</i>

464
00:42:34,769 --> 00:42:38,859
<i>Everyone can fall at least once.</i>

465
00:42:38,859 --> 00:42:43,987
<i>But you can't get yourself down now.</i>

466

<i>Until the day I collapse
going down my path</i>

467
00:42:49,671 --> 00:42:54,568
<i>I'm going to stand up and
face it one more time.</i>

00:43:43,689 --> 00:43:46,788
<i>- Is this Choi Myung Sik?</i>
- Yes, it is.

477
00:43:48,082 --> 00:43:49,527
Yes.

478
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:50,995
You postponed your
surgery before.

479
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:53,544
What date should I reschedule it for?

480
00:43:53,544 --> 00:43:56,667
About that...

481
00:43:56,667 --> 00:44:00,590
I don't think I can get surgery.
I'm sorry.

482
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:02,924
You can't afford not
to get surgery at this time.

483
00:44:02,924 --> 00:44:06,824
<i>Choi Myung Sik!
Choi Myung Sik!</i>

484
00:44:16,765 --> 00:44:21,286
Joon Hyun. This came for you.

485
00:44:21,286 --> 00:44:23,556
Wow, it was...

486
00:44:24,462 --> 00:44:29,407
What's this? Jang Joon Hyun,
has your memory returned?

487
00:44:29,407 --> 00:44:32,204
Wow, this is good news!

488
00:44:32,204 --> 00:44:34,235
This is good! I'm so happy for you!

489
00:44:34,235 --> 00:44:36,063
- This is good news!
- Can you laugh right now?

490
00:44:36,063 --> 00:44:37,619
Get on your knees.

491
00:44:44,013 --> 00:44:47,275
I'm sorry.
I deserve to die.

492
00:44:48,708 --> 00:44:50,375
You deserve to die?

493
00:44:52,027 --> 00:44:53,967
For what?

494
00:44:53,967 --> 00:44:56,815
For having handed me over
to the police?

495
00:44:56,815 --> 00:45:02,046
Or not telling me about Choon Hee?
What do you think is the graver sin?

496
00:45:03,514 --> 00:45:05,931
The second?

497
00:45:06,674 --> 00:45:10,157
Forget it. There's something
you need to do for me.

498
00:45:10,157 --> 00:45:12,060
What's that?

499
00:45:13,373 --> 00:45:16,527
Keep it a secret that my memory's
returned for the time being.

500
00:45:16,527 --> 00:45:18,011
Huh?

501
00:45:18,011 --> 00:45:20,590
If Director Yang finds out, who know
what will happen to Choon Hee.

502
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:23,436
You can keep this secret, right?

503
00:45:24,845 --> 00:45:27,984
- I got it.
- I'll kill you if you betray me again.

504
00:45:29,384 --> 00:45:32,887
I... thought you'd be better
if I did that...

505
00:45:37,836 --> 00:45:40,183
Joon Hyun, is it okay
to overwork yourself

506
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:42,554
like this when you
were just discharged?

507
00:45:44,767 --> 00:45:46,241
- Soo In.
- Hmm?

508
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:50,578
Just a minute.

509
00:45:58,146 --> 00:46:01,990
There's something that
I've been wanting to ask you.

510
00:46:03,913 --> 00:46:05,347
W...what's that?

511
00:46:07,008 --> 00:46:10,835
That day... the day of the accident...

512
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:14,136
Why were you up on that stage?

513
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:19,225
That wasn't your stage, but
Choi Choon Hee's concert.

514
00:46:21,555 --> 00:46:26,181
That... I went to cheer Choon Hee on.

515
00:46:26,181 --> 00:46:27,811
She's my junior, after all.

516
00:46:27,811 --> 00:46:30,102
I went because I should at least
be looking after her.

517
00:46:30,706 --> 00:46:33,043
I see.

518
00:46:34,465 --> 00:46:38,115
But the thing is... I keep having
these weird thoughts.

519
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:42,990
That someone was targeting
someone else...

520
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:45,606
and that I was hit for their sakes.

521
00:46:47,154 --> 00:46:50,336
By any chance...

522
00:46:50,336 --> 00:46:52,191
was that person was
targeting Choi Choon Hee.

523
00:46:52,862 --> 00:46:57,463
J...Joon Hyun, I don't even want
to think about that day.

524
00:46:57,463 --> 00:47:00,180
Do you know how surprised I was
when you were hurt?

525
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:02,786
I seriously thought that
something terrible happened to you.

526
00:47:04,038 --> 00:47:07,877
All that's important to me
is that you're safe, Joon Hyun.

527
00:47:07,877 --> 00:47:10,897
If someone targeted Choi Choon Hee...

528
00:47:10,897 --> 00:47:12,690
then that's a relief.

529
00:47:15,143 --> 00:47:17,195
But someone I love.

530
00:47:19,367 --> 00:47:22,847
If they were targeting you, then I
probably couldn't stand aside.

531
00:47:24,645 --> 00:47:26,988
I'd hunt them down to the end.

532
00:47:34,955 --> 00:47:37,379
Come in.

533
00:47:48,412 --> 00:47:50,387
Come in. What brings you here?

534
00:47:51,576 --> 00:47:53,450
I came to see you, of course.

535
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:57,202
Is that right?
Should I call Soo In over, too?

536
00:47:57,202 --> 00:47:58,946
We could all have dinner later.

537
00:47:58,946 --> 00:48:02,293
More importantly, I have something
to tell you, Director Yang.

538
00:48:03,252 --> 00:48:04,754
Go ahead.

539
00:48:05,851 --> 00:48:07,845
There's something that's been
on my mind.

540
00:48:07,845 --> 00:48:09,990
About the accident last time...

541
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:14,913
I went to the office at the concert
because I'm superstitious.

542
00:48:14,913 --> 00:48:19,406
But it just so happened that
the CCTV cameras weren't on then.

543
00:48:20,758 --> 00:48:25,775
I lost my cellphone there too.

544
00:48:27,649 --> 00:48:29,495
And so?

545
00:48:29,495 --> 00:48:32,773
I'm thinking... that I need
to look more into it.

546
00:48:36,401 --> 00:48:40,427
Aren't you overdoing it when
your body isn't up to it yet?

547
00:48:41,072 --> 00:48:43,356
I'll look into that problem myself
from now on.

548
00:48:43,356 --> 00:48:45,060
- You...
- No.

549
00:48:45,834 --> 00:48:48,796
I'm the type who gets impatient
when I'm curious.

550
00:48:49,973 --> 00:48:52,327
I'm planning to hunt it down
myself to the end.

551
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:01,493
But the thing is...

552
00:49:01,493 --> 00:49:08,706
Why... are you telling me
all this right now?

553
00:49:09,584 --> 00:49:11,209
What do you mean?

554
00:49:13,193 --> 00:49:17,138
We'll be a family soon, and family
shares everything with each other.

555
00:49:17,138 --> 00:49:19,376
Am I wrong, Director Yang?

556
00:49:20,292 --> 00:49:23,985
Of course... you aren't wrong.

557
00:49:28,658 --> 00:49:30,521
Mom, Joon Hyun is acting weird.

558
00:49:30,521 --> 00:49:34,387
I'll say. He keeps
asking about that day.

559
00:49:34,387 --> 00:49:35,594
He went to you, too?

560
00:49:35,594 --> 00:49:38,237
Did his memory return
and he's pretending it didn't?

561
00:49:38,237 --> 00:49:40,603
Wait a minute.

562
00:49:40,603 --> 00:49:44,031
Let's think of an order.
What's the priority.

563
00:49:51,515 --> 00:49:54,309
When will our little Byul....
She's here.

564
00:50:04,476 --> 00:50:06,882
Hey.

565
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,918
- Ow!
- I heard you hit my sister!

566
00:50:15,523 --> 00:50:18,503
You! You called your older
sister like a coward?

567
00:50:18,503 --> 00:50:20,972
You little punk!
So fearless!

568
00:50:20,972 --> 00:50:22,847
Do you want to be hit?

569
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:25,453
You little punks! So fearless!

570
00:50:25,453 --> 00:50:26,989
Do you want to be hit?

571
00:50:26,989 --> 00:50:28,314
Mister!

572
00:50:28,314 --> 00:50:32,290
Who is it? You won't let go?
Let go!

573
00:50:33,006 --> 00:50:34,737
You let go first.

574
00:50:40,672 --> 00:50:44,480
Mister, don't butt in
and be on your way.

575
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,066
How annoying.

576
00:50:46,066 --> 00:50:49,296
Pick up the gum you spat out right now.

577
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:50,916
What is he saying?

578
00:50:50,916 --> 00:50:53,196
This man, seriously...

579
00:50:53,196 --> 00:50:55,252
He doesn't know what
to be afraid of.

580
00:50:57,248 --> 00:51:00,380
Hey, who are you?

581
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:02,437
Who are you to talk like that?

582
00:51:04,014 --> 00:51:06,744
I'm...

583
00:51:08,293 --> 00:51:12,582
Music's god... Jang Joon Hyun.

584
00:51:12,582 --> 00:51:14,512
- Oh my god!
- Ah! Joon Hyun!

585
00:51:14,512 --> 00:51:16,411
You're really Jang Joon Hyun?

586
00:51:17,758 --> 00:51:19,581
What do I do? Hit me!

587
00:51:19,999 --> 00:51:22,665
It hurts! This isn't a dream!

588
00:51:24,789 --> 00:51:26,177
Kids.

589
00:51:26,177 --> 00:51:31,202
I'm part of Byul's family, but you
seem to be giving her a hard time.

590
00:51:31,202 --> 00:51:33,528
No, no. What do you mean?

591
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:36,755
I'm seeing this cutie
for the first time!

592
00:51:39,317 --> 00:51:42,056
My little sister is really
good friends with her!

593
00:51:42,056 --> 00:51:44,249
- Isn't that right?
- Then...

594
00:51:44,249 --> 00:51:46,289
You're going to get along
from now on, right?

595
00:51:47,523 --> 00:51:49,307
Hurry up and answer.

596
00:51:50,439 --> 00:51:51,472
Yes.

597
00:51:59,666 --> 00:52:01,454
- Should I give you an autograph?
- Yes, yes!

598
00:52:01,454 --> 00:52:03,879
- Should I take a picture with you?
- Yes!

599
00:52:03,879 --> 00:52:05,341
All right!

600
00:52:05,341 --> 00:52:07,722
- Does it taste good?
- It does.

601
00:52:09,649 --> 00:52:13,354
Byul, about today...

602
00:52:13,758 --> 00:52:16,981
I know. It's a secret
to my sister, right?

603
00:52:18,738 --> 00:52:19,913
Secret? Okay.

604
00:52:19,913 --> 00:52:21,203
Okay.

605
00:52:22,464 --> 00:52:24,367
- Bang!
- Bang!

606
00:52:24,367 --> 00:52:26,011
- Bang, bang!
- Bang, bang, bang!

607
00:52:26,011 --> 00:52:30,116
Choi Myung Sik? It's been a while
since I've seen him, too.

608
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:37,245
Anyone home?

609
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:52,698
Father!

610
00:52:53,843 --> 00:52:56,313
Father, are you okay?

611
00:53:11,473 --> 00:53:13,710
Here, here, here.

612
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:16,214
It's fine. It's hot, it's hot.
Be careful.

613
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:20,020
You haven't eaten until now?

614
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:23,476
That's what I'm saying.
I said we should eat anywhere, but...

615
00:53:23,476 --> 00:53:29,694
For me, if I don't have the ox
bone broth you've cooked overnight

616
00:53:29,694 --> 00:53:32,455
to have this soondae soup...

617
00:53:32,455 --> 00:53:35,863
Then no matter what I eat,
it feels like I haven't eaten.

618
00:53:37,124 --> 00:53:38,577
Check, please!

619
00:53:38,577 --> 00:53:40,065
- Yes.
- Sit down.

620
00:53:40,065 --> 00:53:42,005
Coming!

621
00:53:44,025 --> 00:53:45,951
- For two, yes?
- Yes.

622
00:53:46,775 --> 00:53:48,821
Fourteen thousand Won.

623
00:53:51,185 --> 00:53:52,591
Goodbye!

624
00:54:04,479 --> 00:54:08,301
Father, are you awake now?

625
00:54:24,145 --> 00:54:27,941
In order to resolve my debts...

626
00:54:27,941 --> 00:54:31,111
I went to loan sharks and
took out a private loan.

627
00:54:32,774 --> 00:54:35,943
But then I was nearly beaten
to death by them.

628
00:54:37,739 --> 00:54:41,158
When I opened my eyes,
I was in the hospital.

629
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:45,282
I also have colon cancer.

630
00:54:46,378 --> 00:54:52,637
I found out... that I only have
six months to live.

631
00:54:55,103 --> 00:54:58,214
I don't have the money
to pay for treatment, either.

632
00:54:59,154 --> 00:55:04,023
But I wanted to leave something
to my children before I went...

633
00:55:04,023 --> 00:55:06,419
So I started cleaning.

634
00:55:10,423 --> 00:55:13,035
But this pitiful life...

635
00:55:15,101 --> 00:55:18,313
is still breathing.

636
00:55:29,634 --> 00:55:33,036
When I was in grade school...

637
00:55:33,036 --> 00:55:38,688
I came back from school
to find out that my father had died.

638
00:55:45,299 --> 00:55:47,087
I shouldn't have gone
to school that day.

639
00:55:49,831 --> 00:55:55,086
I should have stayed by his side
for one more hour...

640
00:55:59,194 --> 00:56:04,978
You hAve no idea how
long I regretted that.

641
00:56:11,278 --> 00:56:13,412
Father.

642
00:56:14,431 --> 00:56:18,228
Choon Hee's having a really hard time
because of various scandals.

643
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:22,534
I'm going to go back to Choon Hee.

644
00:56:22,534 --> 00:56:27,058
But before I do, couldn't you
take care of her for now?

645
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:34,460
Even if it's just for an hour more.

646
00:56:44,065 --> 00:56:45,843
Yes.

647
00:56:46,718 --> 00:56:49,294
- President.
- Yes.

648
00:56:49,294 --> 00:56:52,308
Hello.

649
00:56:52,308 --> 00:56:55,015
I heard you had a concert
at a homeless persons' event.

650
00:56:55,015 --> 00:57:00,209
Yes, I went to help volunteer
but they were so good to me.

651
00:57:01,087 --> 00:57:04,871
It had a positive response,
so the company is going to help out.

652
00:57:04,871 --> 00:57:07,363
Oh really? That's really great news.

653
00:57:08,705 --> 00:57:12,155
And... at the concert...

654
00:57:12,155 --> 00:57:15,039
I think I discovered
an extremely important fact.

655
00:57:16,779 --> 00:57:18,820
Congratulating people
when they're happy,

656
00:57:18,833 --> 00:57:20,884
comforting those
when they're sad...

657
00:57:20,884 --> 00:57:26,358
and a song that doesn't differentiate
between age groups is trot.

658
00:57:27,627 --> 00:57:30,334
I really must be made for trot.

659
00:57:32,827 --> 00:57:35,376
I'm happiest when I sing trot.

660
00:57:36,647 --> 00:57:41,571
So about the ballad album
that you mentioned last time...

661
00:57:41,571 --> 00:57:43,710
Understood.
We'll pretend that never came up.

662
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,617
As expected!

663
00:57:45,617 --> 00:57:47,751
Thank you!

664
00:58:02,172 --> 00:58:07,643
Choi Choon Hee? Yes it was her who was
hospitalized with Jang Joon Hyun.

665
00:58:15,848 --> 00:58:18,520
Has Joon Hyun's memories returned?

666
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,980
Or has he just fallen
for Choi Choon Hee again?

667
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:23,386
How do we make sure?

668
00:58:23,386 --> 00:58:25,862
Just do as I tell you.

669
00:58:30,342 --> 00:58:32,467
I'll cook it for you.
Go and get changed.

670
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:34,015
Okay.

671
00:58:59,468 --> 00:59:01,524
Choon Hee.

672
00:59:03,398 --> 00:59:07,444
The strings on my ukelele are fixed.
Did you fix them?

673
00:59:07,444 --> 00:59:09,268
No.

674
00:59:11,022 --> 00:59:13,781
Huh? The fan turns now.

675
00:59:56,058 --> 00:59:58,563
Joon Hyun, I love it.

676
00:59:58,563 --> 01:00:00,739
You bought this for me, right?

677
01:00:00,739 --> 01:00:02,358
It says 'Angel' here.

678
01:00:04,766 --> 01:00:07,017
It wasn't?

679
01:00:08,923 --> 01:00:11,034
What's with your expression, Joon Hyun?

680
01:00:13,634 --> 01:00:17,379
- I'm disappointed in you, Soo In.
- Huh?

681
01:00:24,054 --> 01:00:26,584
I wanted to give it to you properly.

682
01:00:27,883 --> 01:00:29,869
I wanted to see your
surprised expression.

683
01:00:32,832 --> 01:00:35,181
So are you angry, Joon Hyun?

684
01:00:35,181 --> 01:00:37,704
I'm sorry. What do I do?

685
01:00:39,265 --> 01:00:41,517
I'm just kidding.

686
01:00:41,517 --> 01:00:46,091
Why do I have such good taste?
It suits you perfectly.

687
01:00:48,034 --> 01:00:50,126
Seriously.

688
01:01:13,567 --> 01:01:16,905
Good thing you came!
Fix my ukelele strings for me!

689
01:01:16,905 --> 01:01:19,953
- The rotation's broken.
- In this heat?

690
01:01:19,953 --> 01:01:21,951
Watch out!

691
01:02:05,553 --> 01:02:09,517
I'll drink it well.

692
01:03:05,221 --> 01:03:07,714
I'm back.

693
01:03:17,014 --> 01:03:25,014
