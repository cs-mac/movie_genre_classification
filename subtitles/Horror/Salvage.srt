1
00:01:18,895 --> 00:01:21,393
- Busy night?
- Four customers!

2
00:01:21,394 --> 00:01:23,342
Oh~oh, a record!

3
00:01:23,343 --> 00:01:26,543
- Will you count it for me?
- I always do.

4
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:29,302
Thanks...
Good night!

5
00:01:29,357 --> 00:01:31,003
Have a good morning.

6
00:01:31,004 --> 00:01:32,003
Hm...

7
00:01:43,217 --> 00:01:46,803
Please, please, stop it!
Please dont!

7
00:01:46,804 --> 00:01:48,803
You don't have to do this.

8
00:02:27,122 --> 00:02:29,486
God, Jimmy, you're late again.

9
00:02:29,487 --> 00:02:32,073
I told you I got class.

10
00:02:34,511 --> 00:02:37,230
- Who are you?
- My friends call me Duke,

11
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:39,367
Jimmy couldn't make it,
he send me to pick you up.

12
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:40,762
What'd you mean,
he couldn't make it?

13
00:02:40,763 --> 00:02:44,645
Come on, you can ask him yourself,
I know him from the salvage yard.

14
00:02:44,646 --> 00:02:47,965
Hey, we even put in a new starter.
Listen...

15
00:02:52,686 --> 00:02:54,734
Good as new.

16
00:02:56,936 --> 00:02:59,515
What's the matter?
Come on, I gotta get back.

17
00:02:59,839 --> 00:03:01,424
Okay.

18
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:24,157
Do you mind
if I listen to music?

19
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,601
Whatever.

20
00:03:39,002 --> 00:03:41,020
You know you might have
to give me directions,

21
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:43,190
I didn't write it down
what Jimmy told me.

22
00:03:43,191 --> 00:03:44,913
Okay.

23
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:47,868
- How do you know Jimmy?
- We're friends.

24
00:03:50,841 --> 00:03:52,692
He's a great kid.

25
00:03:56,218 --> 00:03:58,975
You know he's always
bragging about you?

26
00:03:59,961 --> 00:04:01,434
I can't say blame him...

27
00:04:01,435 --> 00:04:04,534
I gotta tell you, I think you're
the prettiest girl I've ever seen.

28
00:04:06,015 --> 00:04:07,834
Thanks.

29
00:04:09,446 --> 00:04:12,413
If I had a girl like you,
I guess I brag too.

30
00:04:31,301 --> 00:04:33,462
What the fuck are you doing?

31
00:04:33,593 --> 00:04:36,700
I just wanna see your pretty face,
you got nice skin.

32
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,083
You don't have to touch it.

33
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,064
You haven't talked very much,
I'm not trying to rape you.

34
00:04:42,204 --> 00:04:45,264
I'm sure you don't act like that
when Jimmy touches you, huh?

35
00:04:51,178 --> 00:04:54,270
You're not gonna be
a stuck-up cunt, are you?

36
00:04:56,799 --> 00:05:00,334
Don't tell me you're another one
of those fucking cunt's.

37
00:05:04,021 --> 00:05:06,048
Turn right here.

38
00:05:21,651 --> 00:05:23,499
I better walk you up
to the door, huh?

39
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,056
I'm alright, thanks.

40
00:05:30,712 --> 00:05:32,234
Mom.

41
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:37,227
Mom, are you here?

42
00:05:49,907 --> 00:05:53,972
Jimmy, it's me. Look... um, some
weirdo picked me up in your truck...

43
00:05:53,973 --> 00:05:57,255
and drove me home and... and I wanna
make sure you're not dead or something.

44
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:59,063
Call me.

45
00:06:37,557 --> 00:06:40,533
You know, I can see you
through the door.

46
00:06:42,751 --> 00:06:44,698
It's me, Duke.
You remember me?

47
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,972
I just give you a ride home.

48
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,369
What'd you want?

49
00:06:49,797 --> 00:06:53,352
Oh, you left something in my car,
I thought you might want it back.

50
00:06:53,353 --> 00:06:55,137
What?

51
00:06:56,339 --> 00:06:58,839
Your ear-ring.

52
00:07:00,297 --> 00:07:02,417
I'm not gonna open the door.

53
00:07:06,706 --> 00:07:09,255
Quit foolin' around,
open the door.

54
00:07:09,747 --> 00:07:13,771
- No.
- All right, hey, I tell you what...

55
00:07:13,973 --> 00:07:16,633
I just leave it out here,
at the porch for you, alright?

56
00:07:16,634 --> 00:07:18,733
You can get it later,
how'd that be?

57
00:07:19,894 --> 00:07:21,978
That would be great.

58
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:25,623
All right then,
that's what I'm gonna do, superstar.

59
00:07:26,991 --> 00:07:28,986
See you later.

60
00:09:40,068 --> 00:09:43,106
Please God, no...

61
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:51,867
Go ahead and press it,
I won't pay over-time.

62
00:09:55,973 --> 00:09:57,882
Are you okay?

63
00:09:58,984 --> 00:10:00,784
Yeah.

64
00:10:01,227 --> 00:10:05,509
Don't worry about me, I'll...
huh, take care of this for you.

65
00:10:43,861 --> 00:10:45,591
Get in.

66
00:10:53,501 --> 00:10:55,083
Hey.

67
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:01,005
- What's the matter?
- Sorry.

68
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,654
Forget it.

69
00:11:06,114 --> 00:11:09,065
- Long night?
- Work was okay, but...

70
00:11:09,066 --> 00:11:11,179
I think I must've
dozed off or something,

71
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,679
I had this fucked-up dream.

72
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,057
- Was I in it?
- No.

73
00:11:15,757 --> 00:11:19,333
There was like... this creepy guy,
who picked me up from work...

74
00:11:19,334 --> 00:11:22,926
drove me home, dragged me into
the basement and killed me.

75
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,730
Oh, man...
that's so weird.

76
00:11:27,092 --> 00:11:30,316
- I had this crazy dream too.
- No shit! Really?

77
00:11:30,317 --> 00:11:32,471
You and me, we...
we were getting it on, right?

78
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:34,957
And here's the weird thing.

79
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,810
Jen, shows up... and she went like:
Yeah, I always wanna do it with a girl.

80
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:40,590
- And, huh...
- Right.

81
00:11:40,591 --> 00:11:43,120
So lame, I can't even believe
we're having this conversation.

82
00:11:43,121 --> 00:11:45,521
Well... I know Jennifer,
your best friend.

83
00:11:45,522 --> 00:11:48,061
I just think we should at least
ask her, if she'll do that.

84
00:11:48,062 --> 00:11:49,614
You want me have sex
with your best friend?

85
00:11:49,615 --> 00:11:52,011
Did you not with my friend?

86
00:11:52,881 --> 00:11:55,417
Okay, let's not go there.

87
00:12:02,205 --> 00:12:04,222
You wanna come in?

88
00:12:04,764 --> 00:12:07,533
- My mom's home.
- Figures.

89
00:13:16,841 --> 00:13:20,041
- Jesus mom, you scared me.
- Oh, no kidding?

90
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:21,892
You gonna open the door,
or you want me to?

91
00:13:21,893 --> 00:13:24,096
- Wait.
- What?

92
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,836
Don't open it.

93
00:13:28,505 --> 00:13:30,405
- Hi. Jimmy.
- How are you, Kate?

94
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,105
- How you doin'?
- I'm great...

95
00:13:32,106 --> 00:13:34,502
That's a smokin' blouse
you're wearing today.

96
00:13:34,503 --> 00:13:36,727
Well, thank you.
That's a very nice compliment.

97
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:38,198
You know it almost makes me think,

98
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:40,548
I should take you out
instead of your daughter.

99
00:13:40,932 --> 00:13:43,524
Hello... get a room!

100
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:47,089
Yeah... well,
I'm gonna go wait in the truck.

101
00:13:50,842 --> 00:13:52,646
Are you late for class again?

102
00:13:52,647 --> 00:13:53,784
Mom...

103
00:13:53,785 --> 00:13:56,421
You know that Jimmy is kind enough.
to come and get you every morning,

104
00:13:56,422 --> 00:13:58,452
because you can't be bothered
to get your drivers licence,

105
00:13:58,453 --> 00:14:00,172
the least you can do
is to be ready.

106
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,203
None of your buisness.

107
00:14:01,204 --> 00:14:04,450
You're 19 years old, the agreement was
that'd you stay here, while you...

108
00:14:04,451 --> 00:14:06,683
Blah... blah... blah...
blah... blah...

109
00:14:06,684 --> 00:14:08,820
Have a nice day!

110
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:11,820
Whoa... whoa, whoa.

111
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:16,863
- Can you... huh, you push the truck?
- Why, what about this shit?

112
00:14:16,864 --> 00:14:20,294
What? You don't have a drivers license,
how you gonna jump-start the truck?

113
00:14:20,813 --> 00:14:22,570
Please.

114
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,398
Thank you.

115
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,720
Hurry up, put some ass into it.

116
00:14:31,988 --> 00:14:33,922
Push harder!

117
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:45,164
- Was that enough ass for you?
- That was a lotta ass, baby.

118
00:14:45,165 --> 00:14:48,725
You know that's all the ass you gonna
get until you get the starter fixed.

119
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:06,589
<i>Through me is the way,
into the woeful city.</i>

120
00:15:06,935 --> 00:15:09,605
Through me is the way,
to the eternal world.

121
00:15:09,606 --> 00:15:12,368
Through me is the way,
among the lost people.

122
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,020
Justice moved my locken maker.

123
00:15:15,021 --> 00:15:19,171
Divine power, the supreme wisdom,
and abiding love made thee.

124
00:15:19,172 --> 00:15:20,834
Before thee,

125
00:15:20,835 --> 00:15:24,202
things created stay eternal,
and my eternal lasts!

126
00:15:24,608 --> 00:15:27,850
Appending all hope
thee who enter.

127
00:15:43,245 --> 00:15:45,354
- Oh'oh...
- Sorry about that.

128
00:15:45,355 --> 00:15:47,485
Um... we're about
outta time anyway...

129
00:15:47,486 --> 00:15:48,486
Please don't forget,

129
00:15:48,487 --> 00:15:50,986
you know that 3 page report on
escrows is due for tomorrow.

130
00:15:50,987 --> 00:15:52,885
I'll see you then.

131
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,424
Watch?
Watch this.

132
00:16:00,572 --> 00:16:02,062
Come on.

133
00:16:02,063 --> 00:16:04,962
What you doing?
Let's go.

134
00:16:05,063 --> 00:16:06,962
Fuck you.

135
00:16:07,572 --> 00:16:10,362
- I'll just carry you.
- Okay.

136
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,372
What's that for?

137
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:41,812
How about a... picnic under
the bleachers, something like that.

138
00:16:41,813 --> 00:16:44,104
Somebody might see.

139
00:16:44,105 --> 00:16:46,773
So? That makes it exciting.

140
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:54,995
Sounds like we got company.

141
00:16:56,796 --> 00:16:59,896
I thought
that's what makes it exciting.

142
00:17:59,629 --> 00:18:03,275
- Huh, some one's up there.
- Yeah, no shit.

143
00:18:03,281 --> 00:18:06,147
- Will you check it out?
- I just did.

144
00:18:06,148 --> 00:18:08,115
Please.

145
00:18:29,728 --> 00:18:31,727
Claire...

146
00:18:31,728 --> 00:18:34,018
you're acting crazy today.

147
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:37,519
I know, I'm sorry.

148
00:19:58,506 --> 00:20:00,949
No... no... no... no!

149
00:21:21,506 --> 00:21:23,449
Hello?

150
00:21:24,207 --> 00:21:26,570
Is there anybody down there?

151
00:21:49,314 --> 00:21:51,236
Hello?

152
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,351
Mom?

153
00:22:02,286 --> 00:22:04,312
Mom you in there?

154
00:22:07,542 --> 00:22:09,781
Turn the light on.

155
00:22:41,105 --> 00:22:45,208
What the hell you're doing down here
in the dark? Who are you talking to?

156
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:48,399
I lost something down here.

157
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,854
I was just looking for it.

158
00:22:58,134 --> 00:23:00,432
I guess I'll get it.

159
00:23:09,531 --> 00:23:11,459
- Hello.
- Hey, what's up?

160
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,661
Hey Jimmy.

161
00:23:12,662 --> 00:23:16,102
Sam and I playing basketball tomorrow,
and I thought maybe you could bring Jen.

162
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,183
Yeah, I guess.

163
00:23:18,413 --> 00:23:20,600
Yeah, Jen told me
she liked basketball.

164
00:23:20,601 --> 00:23:22,650
Hey Jimmy, are you okay?

165
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:26,351
- Huh... yeah, why wouldn't I be?
- No reason.

166
00:23:26,654 --> 00:23:29,569
So... huh, see you
at the basketball court tomorrow.

167
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:32,739
- Yeah, okay, see you.
- You'll bring Jen.

168
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,663
- Bye.
- Will you bring Jen?

169
00:23:37,522 --> 00:23:39,556
Are you ready for this, James?
This ball in that hole.

170
00:23:39,557 --> 00:23:41,756
- Let's go... do it... do it...
- I'm doing it right now, ready?

171
00:23:41,757 --> 00:23:44,061
- Alright... here we go.
- Ohh...

172
00:23:46,062 --> 00:23:49,656
- That's, man!... Gosh...
- Calm down man, it's just a game.

173
00:23:49,657 --> 00:23:52,004
It's uncalled for, I wanna
play basketball here.

174
00:23:52,005 --> 00:23:55,309
- So, huh, Jimmy had a dream last night.
- Oh yeah? Let's hear it.

175
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:58,708
You me and him had a 3 way.

176
00:23:59,109 --> 00:24:00,211
No...

177
00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:03,857
Hey, guys you're ready? I'm gonna
teach that boy a lesson of humility.

178
00:24:03,858 --> 00:24:06,205
Alright, let's see it.

179
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,511
Yeah...

180
00:24:11,512 --> 00:24:13,811
I won't play
with you no more.

181
00:24:13,812 --> 00:24:16,217
Just get some training
and come back.

182
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,842
- Hi, baby.
- Nice dream, Jimmy.

183
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:25,817
- What's your name?
- You told her?

184
00:24:25,818 --> 00:24:29,036
Oh yeah, you should tell Sam.
I think he might like to hear it.

185
00:25:10,641 --> 00:25:11,942
Ready?

186
00:25:12,541 --> 00:25:14,242
No.

187
00:25:15,528 --> 00:25:18,355
Show me how to do it,
and you push it.

188
00:25:19,314 --> 00:25:21,697
Alright, well... uh,
this pedal is the clutch.

189
00:25:21,698 --> 00:25:23,944
You put your foot on it,
push it down,

189
00:25:23,945 --> 00:25:25,744
when I tell you to,
let her go.

190
00:25:26,802 --> 00:25:28,978
That's what you've been doing
this whole time?

191
00:25:28,979 --> 00:25:30,520
Hm, pretty cool, huh?

192
00:25:30,521 --> 00:25:33,338
Learn something new every day.

193
00:25:41,094 --> 00:25:43,711
Come on, Sally,
put some ass into it.

194
00:25:43,712 --> 00:25:46,596
Hey, what did Jen say about
my dream when you told her?

195
00:25:46,597 --> 00:25:48,174
She thought it was funny.

196
00:25:48,175 --> 00:25:53,098
Funny like... how? It's disgusting,
or like... that might be kinda cool?

197
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:54,998
If you wanna fuck Jennifer,

197
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:56,428
then just do it,
I'm not stopping you.

198
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,835
Pop the clutch.
Pop the clutch.

199
00:26:05,178 --> 00:26:07,488
Oh come on, give me a little
more credit then that.

200
00:26:07,489 --> 00:26:10,022
I mean...
I would never cheat on you.

201
00:26:10,536 --> 00:26:12,053
But if you want me to,

202
00:26:12,054 --> 00:26:13,651
I mean here,
I would do it right now.

203
00:26:13,652 --> 00:26:15,324
I would do it right now.

204
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:17,668
Because that's how much
I love you.

205
00:26:18,695 --> 00:26:21,022
Are you retarted?

206
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,631
Take me home... God!

207
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:42,099
Mom?

208
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:45,377
Mom, are you there?

208
00:29:45,378 --> 00:29:48,277
Yes I'm here,
I'm just getting dressed.

209
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,124
Okay.

210
00:30:01,343 --> 00:30:03,363
Jeez mom, nice outfit...

210
00:30:03,364 --> 00:30:05,063
what'd you got
a hot date or something?

211
00:30:05,064 --> 00:30:06,802
He's somebody I met at work.

211
00:30:06,803 --> 00:30:08,402
He... huh, worked there
something over a year.

212
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:10,274
What?

213
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:12,345
So, can you... huh,
get yourself up...

213
00:30:12,346 --> 00:30:14,245
and... huh, to class
in the morning?

214
00:30:14,858 --> 00:30:16,431
I guess...

215
00:30:16,432 --> 00:30:19,533
Because there's some possibility,
that I may be spending the night.

216
00:30:19,534 --> 00:30:21,627
Okay, I get it.

217
00:30:23,358 --> 00:30:25,060
Well, have a good night.

218
00:30:25,061 --> 00:30:27,601
And be careful... okay?

219
00:30:27,602 --> 00:30:30,001
'Cause I worry about you,
in that place all alone.

220
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:32,240
Okay.

221
00:30:32,742 --> 00:30:35,745
I will...
Thanks.

222
00:30:36,642 --> 00:30:37,823
Bye.

223
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:40,471
Have fun on your date.

224
00:30:43,794 --> 00:30:45,832
- Hey Gertie.
- Hey.

225
00:30:51,499 --> 00:30:54,532
- Busy night?
- No, it's been dead.

226
00:30:54,534 --> 00:30:57,447
Oh, good...
I didn't get any sleep last night.

227
00:30:57,448 --> 00:30:58,847
I'm ready to do lull.

228
00:30:59,464 --> 00:31:02,345
Don't let Cleatus catch you,
he said he might stop by later.

229
00:31:02,346 --> 00:31:03,808
What's he gonna do, fire me?

230
00:31:03,809 --> 00:31:05,463
- Yeah.
- I wish.

231
00:31:05,464 --> 00:31:07,686
- See you.
- Bye.

232
00:33:42,056 --> 00:33:44,448
Hello?

233
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:51,065
If anyone is over there?
I'm gonna press the alarm.

234
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,229
The police are gonna come.

235
00:36:17,979 --> 00:36:19,694
Not yet.

236
00:36:57,361 --> 00:36:59,929
- It's okay, it's alright.
- He's in there.

237
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:02,774
It'll be alright,
we'll get 'em.

238
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:11,241
Alright Claire,
what this guy look like?

239
00:37:11,722 --> 00:37:15,575
Okay... he had red hair.

240
00:37:15,659 --> 00:37:20,113
And he was... I guess he was
like... huh, average hight...

241
00:37:20,213 --> 00:37:22,713
Um... he... huh...

242
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:25,895
he was wearing this like
gray jacket, and...

242
00:37:25,896 --> 00:37:28,095
and he said he worked
at the salvage-yard, so...

243
00:37:28,096 --> 00:37:31,514
I did get it stained...
I...

244
00:37:34,828 --> 00:37:36,395
What?

245
00:37:36,906 --> 00:37:39,090
Claire, are you high?

246
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:41,112
No.

247
00:37:41,312 --> 00:37:44,698
From time to time, you don't...
smoke a little weed,

247
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:46,598
do a little extacy?

248
00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:52,140
- I just think you'd... huh...
- What am I supposed to say?

249
00:37:52,181 --> 00:37:54,466
I used to buy it off of you
in the parking-lot,

249
00:37:54,467 --> 00:37:56,016
before you became
Captain ass-hole.

250
00:37:56,017 --> 00:37:57,642
All right, alright,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

251
00:37:57,643 --> 00:38:00,347
Alright... let's move on.

252
00:38:00,348 --> 00:38:03,313
Would you get the TV
and the VCR for me?

253
00:38:05,572 --> 00:38:08,111
There's someting
you'd wanna see.

254
00:38:22,111 --> 00:38:23,769
Alright.

255
00:38:25,418 --> 00:38:27,919
That's you, right?

256
00:38:28,501 --> 00:38:31,048
- Yeah.
- Sleeping.

257
00:38:37,241 --> 00:38:39,756
That's you waking up,

258
00:38:39,757 --> 00:38:42,622
walking across the store,

259
00:38:48,172 --> 00:38:51,158
and getting into a fight
with yourself.

260
00:38:57,413 --> 00:38:59,690
I don't understand.

261
00:39:02,032 --> 00:39:04,016
I felt it.

262
00:39:04,017 --> 00:39:07,611
Look, he had red hair, okay?
He...

263
00:39:07,612 --> 00:39:10,064
He worked at the salvage-yard,
he.. he had a funny name..

264
00:39:10,065 --> 00:39:13,082
- I don't remember it...
- Duke Desmond?

265
00:39:13,094 --> 00:39:16,375
- You know him?
- Yep, yeah...

266
00:39:19,433 --> 00:39:21,485
I shot him death last week.

267
00:39:21,486 --> 00:39:24,534
Everybody in this town
seams to know that, but you.

268
00:39:26,422 --> 00:39:30,854
- He's dead?
- Dead and gone forever.

269
00:39:33,035 --> 00:39:34,935
I'm loosing my mind.

270
00:39:34,936 --> 00:39:37,665
Look...
it's not surprising...

270
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,465
you're having night-mares
about this guy.

271
00:39:39,466 --> 00:39:41,679
It's been all over the news.

272
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,303
We found some kid cut up...

272
00:39:43,304 --> 00:39:45,503
in the back of his own
pick up truck.

273
00:39:46,613 --> 00:39:49,159
I'm sorry,
come on, I'll take you home.

274
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:51,283
Let's go.

275
00:40:28,583 --> 00:40:30,778
You look pretty tired.

276
00:40:30,779 --> 00:40:33,424
Why'd you go ahead lay down
and get some sleep?

277
00:40:33,545 --> 00:40:35,657
I'll wake you up
when you get home.

278
00:40:37,183 --> 00:40:38,760
Thanks.

279
00:41:31,253 --> 00:41:33,237
What the fuck?

280
00:42:32,409 --> 00:42:35,183
God!... No!

281
00:42:35,311 --> 00:42:36,983
Not you!

282
00:43:20,609 --> 00:43:22,283
Shut up!

283
00:43:26,985 --> 00:43:28,732
Well, let me guess...

284
00:43:29,585 --> 00:43:31,332
That one, right?

285
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:33,654
How did I know that?

286
00:43:35,265 --> 00:43:39,413
This just isn't happening.
This isn't for real.

287
00:43:40,852 --> 00:43:43,670
Well, how would you know
what wasn't for real?

288
00:43:43,671 --> 00:43:45,346
Look.

289
00:43:47,312 --> 00:43:49,330
You want me to tell you?

290
00:43:49,331 --> 00:43:51,086
'Cause all of this
is bull-shit.

290
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:53,286
You, me, everything,
it's all made up.

291
00:43:53,761 --> 00:43:56,801
The only thing that's real,
is what you feel.

292
00:43:57,759 --> 00:44:00,737
The only thing that's real
in this whole world,

292
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:04,037
"is what... you... feel"...

293
00:44:05,264 --> 00:44:08,000
when I cut your head off.

294
00:44:13,902 --> 00:44:15,776
Mom! Mom!

295
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,976
No! No! No!

296
00:44:57,302 --> 00:44:58,976
Shut up!

297
00:45:07,586 --> 00:45:11,982
Don't! No, please, don't hurt me.
Let go of me, please!

298
00:45:11,983 --> 00:45:13,835
Please, don't hurt me.

299
00:45:14,811 --> 00:45:17,349
This is not real.

300
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:19,845
This isn't really happening.

301
00:45:20,105 --> 00:45:21,989
This isn't happening.

302
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:24,826
This isn't happening. No!

303
00:45:24,926 --> 00:45:26,926
This isn't happening.

304
00:45:27,263 --> 00:45:31,550
It isn't happening!
Please God, no!

305
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:39,051
This isn't happening!

306
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,628
No! No...

307
00:45:41,629 --> 00:45:44,765
Please, please, God...

308
00:45:48,629 --> 00:45:51,365
God...
No!

309
00:45:54,029 --> 00:45:58,965
No... no... no!
Don't hurt me.

310
00:45:59,449 --> 00:46:01,958
Please don't, Please...

311
00:46:02,269 --> 00:46:04,883
Please. Please. Please!

312
00:46:39,063 --> 00:46:41,044
Good... morning.

313
00:46:42,912 --> 00:46:45,347
What the hell's
the matter with you?

314
00:48:28,283 --> 00:48:31,022
Through me is the way
among the lost people.

315
00:48:31,023 --> 00:48:33,005
Justice moved my locken maker.

316
00:48:33,006 --> 00:48:37,964
Divine power, the supreme wisdom,
and abiding love made thee.

317
00:48:37,965 --> 00:48:39,962
Before thee,

318
00:48:39,963 --> 00:48:43,214
things created stay eternal,
and my eternal lasts!

319
00:48:43,215 --> 00:48:46,411
Appending all hope
thee who enter.

320
00:48:58,482 --> 00:49:01,091
Sorry about that... We're about
out of time for today.

321
00:49:01,092 --> 00:49:02,185
Yes, Claire?

322
00:49:02,186 --> 00:49:04,561
You gave this lecture yesterday.

323
00:49:04,628 --> 00:49:08,033
Well, how would you know?
You weren't even here yesterday.

324
00:49:14,274 --> 00:49:16,023
Where're you going?

325
00:49:17,424 --> 00:49:18,837
What the hell's the problem?

326
00:49:18,838 --> 00:49:20,337
I've been to your house,
your work,

326
00:49:20,338 --> 00:49:22,037
looking for you,
I've waited.

327
00:49:30,156 --> 00:49:33,121
Okay... you're not crazy.

328
00:49:33,858 --> 00:49:35,763
You know I'm here to listen,

328
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:38,063
just tell me
what the problem is.

329
00:49:39,651 --> 00:49:42,206
I'm seeing stuff, Jimmy.

330
00:49:43,366 --> 00:49:45,019
Like what?

331
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:47,647
Like people...
killing me.

332
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:50,482
And... and it isn't like...
I just see it,

332
00:49:50,482 --> 00:49:52,102
I... I feel it too...

333
00:49:52,103 --> 00:49:54,695
it's like... it's really
happening to me.

334
00:49:54,696 --> 00:49:57,765
The weird thing is... okay,

335
00:49:57,766 --> 00:50:01,580
I saw a picture of the guy
who keeps attacking me.

336
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:04,691
Well, that's weird, right?

337
00:50:05,566 --> 00:50:09,698
I saw a picture of the man,
after I imagined him.

338
00:50:10,072 --> 00:50:12,454
What if there's something
with this guy, you know?

339
00:50:12,455 --> 00:50:15,859
I mean... maybe he's a ghost
or something?

340
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:17,807
The sheriff said
he was a serial killer...

340
00:50:17,808 --> 00:50:19,297
and was shot to death.

341
00:50:19,298 --> 00:50:21,728
Claire, what the fuck
are you talking about?

342
00:50:21,729 --> 00:50:25,318
- Well, maybe he's a ghost?
- Bitch, are you crazy?

343
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:27,050
What?

344
00:50:27,051 --> 00:50:29,647
Oh... just great!

345
00:50:29,945 --> 00:50:32,147
I so cannot deal with this.

346
00:50:33,869 --> 00:50:35,943
Fuck you!

347
00:50:42,899 --> 00:50:44,732
Honey.

348
00:50:44,846 --> 00:50:46,601
Wait, please.

349
00:50:46,602 --> 00:50:48,162
I didn't mean
to call you the "B" word.

350
00:50:48,163 --> 00:50:49,930
Go home, Jimmy.

351
00:50:49,931 --> 00:50:52,398
It's just... I didn't know
you'd be talking about some...

351
00:50:52,399 --> 00:50:54,098
serial killer ghost shit.

352
00:50:54,099 --> 00:50:57,744
- Go...
- Just... just... let me help you.

353
00:50:57,781 --> 00:51:00,879
You know what, I... I'll help you,
just... I wanna help you.

354
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,476
Just stop walking down the street,
like you're some kinda kook.

355
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:06,774
Hey, fuck you, Jimmy!
You don't even believe me.

356
00:51:06,775 --> 00:51:10,119
I do believe you.
There is a ghost.

357
00:51:12,985 --> 00:51:15,874
Oh, I'm sorry, it's just
the funny face you just made, I...

358
00:51:15,875 --> 00:51:17,217
I... I do really think
there is a ghost.

359
00:51:17,218 --> 00:51:20,946
- You're just such an ass-hole.
- I'm... I am an ass-hole...

360
00:51:20,947 --> 00:51:24,126
huh... you just made me laugh,
with your funny face.

361
00:51:24,272 --> 00:51:26,274
There really is a ghost,
come on...

362
00:51:26,275 --> 00:51:28,588
- Fuck you!
- Come on.

363
00:51:33,606 --> 00:51:35,302
Hello?

364
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:45,467
Hello?

365
00:51:53,101 --> 00:51:55,095
Is anybody here?

366
00:52:00,021 --> 00:52:03,146
- It's closed.
- Can I help you?

367
00:52:03,364 --> 00:52:05,980
- God, you scared me.
- I'm sorry...

368
00:52:05,981 --> 00:52:07,519
if you're here for the...
huh, bibel-study,

368
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,819
it's at 3 o'clock
this afternoon.

369
00:52:09,821 --> 00:52:13,187
Um, actually, we wanted
to talk to a minister.

370
00:52:13,226 --> 00:52:16,227
- He is out.
- Ask him.

371
00:52:16,228 --> 00:52:18,068
But he's a janitor.

372
00:52:18,069 --> 00:52:21,318
He works in the church,
that's pretty close.

373
00:52:22,069 --> 00:52:23,786
Um...

374
00:52:23,787 --> 00:52:26,540
I don't know if you can help me,
but...

375
00:52:26,541 --> 00:52:28,060
I'm seeing ghosts.

376
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:30,564
Well... a ghost,
just one...

377
00:52:30,565 --> 00:52:32,863
His name is Duke Desmond.

378
00:52:32,864 --> 00:52:34,470
Duke? You sure?

379
00:52:34,471 --> 00:52:37,321
Don't look at me,
I... I haven't seen any ghosts.

380
00:52:37,322 --> 00:52:40,755
- He went to this church.
- But he died, right?

381
00:52:40,756 --> 00:52:43,273
- Yeah, the cops shot him.
- Fantastic.

382
00:52:43,274 --> 00:52:45,401
Hm, that's all you needed to hear.
You ready to go?

383
00:52:45,402 --> 00:52:50,413
He had us all fooled, but there's...
talk of Jesus and salvation.

384
00:52:50,414 --> 00:52:53,796
I guess the devil works
in mysterious ways these days.

385
00:52:53,797 --> 00:52:56,306
Hiding in plain side.

386
00:52:56,586 --> 00:52:59,601
Oh, but you don't have to
worry about him though, huh...

387
00:52:59,602 --> 00:53:02,859
- He wont hurt you.
- That's because he's dead, right?

388
00:53:02,867 --> 00:53:04,700
Because he's in hell.

389
00:53:04,701 --> 00:53:07,615
Wait... one more thing,

390
00:53:07,616 --> 00:53:10,139
you know where he lived?

391
00:53:35,018 --> 00:53:36,317
Hm...

392
00:53:36,318 --> 00:53:38,179
This is it.

393
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:39,502
This is where he lived.

394
00:53:39,503 --> 00:53:41,421
Yeah, it looks like
a psychos house, it's a dump.

395
00:53:41,422 --> 00:53:44,491
Can we get out of here?

396
00:53:49,848 --> 00:53:51,600
It's kinda deserted.

397
00:53:51,601 --> 00:53:54,810
Okay, great, even better.
Can we please leave?

398
00:53:55,879 --> 00:53:57,852
Don't... even think about it.

399
00:53:57,853 --> 00:54:00,829
What? I thought you didn't
believe in this stuff?

400
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:04,123
I don't, it just... this place
gives me a bad feeling.

401
00:54:04,124 --> 00:54:05,926
Like what?

402
00:54:05,927 --> 00:54:08,579
Like you know, when you get
kinda nervous... and...

403
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:11,417
some butter-flies going
through your stomach, and...

404
00:54:11,418 --> 00:54:13,493
You know this place makes me
feel like taking a crap.

405
00:54:13,494 --> 00:54:15,122
Crap.

406
00:54:15,571 --> 00:54:18,589
Okay, well,
I guess you stay here, and...

407
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:21,282
I go look around.

408
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,836
Hello?

409
00:55:55,137 --> 00:55:58,803
Is anybody here? Huh...
I need to use your restroom.

410
00:58:47,919 --> 00:58:49,519
Jimmy.

411
00:58:56,619 --> 00:58:58,019
Come on.

412
00:59:00,279 --> 00:59:02,901
Hi, I need sheriff Miller?

413
00:59:02,902 --> 00:59:05,615
- This is him.
- Sheriff Miller, it's Claire.

414
00:59:05,616 --> 00:59:08,794
Look... um, I'm in a cabin,
out on route 16.

415
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:11,333
I... I think Jimmy come in to get me,
and I think he might've gotten killed...

416
00:59:11,334 --> 00:59:13,547
- and I need somebody to come.
- Whoa, whoa, woman.

417
00:59:13,548 --> 00:59:16,361
Hard for me to tell you
what's going on Claire, but...

418
00:59:16,362 --> 00:59:18,950
we're gonna find out
soon enough.

419
01:00:03,678 --> 01:00:05,754
Who are you now?

420
01:00:19,627 --> 01:00:22,667
Where'd keep your
old news papsers?

421
01:00:23,341 --> 01:00:25,643
Is it for a specific class?

422
01:00:25,644 --> 01:00:28,690
- It doesn't matter.
- Actually it does.

423
01:00:29,742 --> 01:00:33,317
- It's philosophy of antiquity.
- Who's the professor for that?

424
01:00:33,318 --> 01:00:36,515
What is your deal, lady?
Just tell me where it is.

425
01:00:36,516 --> 01:00:39,562
Shh...
this is a library.

426
01:02:14,186 --> 01:02:16,739
Did you find
what you were looking for?

427
01:04:58,871 --> 01:05:00,270
Claire.
Look out!

428
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:03,512
Oh my God, Claire,
what's wrong?

429
01:05:03,989 --> 01:05:06,434
Close the door.

430
01:05:06,467 --> 01:05:08,386
Are you okay?

431
01:05:08,686 --> 01:05:11,088
Come on, let's go
in the other room.

432
01:05:11,747 --> 01:05:13,484
Come on.

433
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:19,737
It's okay,
I'm gonna call the police.

434
01:05:19,738 --> 01:05:22,078
- It's okay.
- No, I already talked to the police.

435
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:24,997
I'm telling you, I... I think
there in on it, I do...

436
01:05:24,998 --> 01:05:27,941
No, it's okay,
I'm your best friend.

437
01:05:27,942 --> 01:05:30,470
I'm here,
I will take care of you.

438
01:05:30,471 --> 01:05:33,253
I promise,
nothing's gonna happened.

439
01:05:33,254 --> 01:05:35,755
You're in a safe place, okay?

440
01:05:41,098 --> 01:05:42,759
Okay?

441
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:13,360
Here.

442
01:06:14,664 --> 01:06:16,444
Come here, sweety.

443
01:06:17,464 --> 01:06:20,352
I called the police,
they're on the way.

444
01:06:20,887 --> 01:06:22,797
It's okay, calm down.

445
01:06:23,956 --> 01:06:26,179
It's okay, Claire,
you're save.

446
01:06:34,099 --> 01:06:37,548
Duke Desmond, don't move!

447
01:06:40,451 --> 01:06:43,454
Hold your positons, I got him.

448
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:50,352
Okay, okay...
You got me officer, you got me.

449
01:06:50,353 --> 01:06:52,871
I found that boy in your truck.

450
01:06:55,130 --> 01:06:57,139
Why'd you do it?

451
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,388
Come on man,
what'd you want me say?

452
01:06:59,389 --> 01:07:00,889
I don't know...

453
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:05,126
Okay, okay, cowboy.

454
01:07:07,917 --> 01:07:09,418
I tell you...

455
01:07:11,458 --> 01:07:14,566
- We're gonna meet with a lawyer.
- What?

456
01:07:17,364 --> 01:07:19,184
You know about them?

457
01:07:21,675 --> 01:07:25,877
I can't resist 'em, man, they're
controlling me with something.

458
01:07:25,878 --> 01:07:27,113
What the hell
you're talking about?

459
01:07:27,114 --> 01:07:29,940
Like I'm getting radiosignals
put into my head, man.

460
01:07:29,941 --> 01:07:32,105
That's how they
must be controlling me...

461
01:07:32,106 --> 01:07:34,818
they put a piece of medal
in my head or something, man...

462
01:07:34,819 --> 01:07:36,692
and it's telling me
what to do.

463
01:07:36,693 --> 01:07:39,115
I can't help it
when I do this shit.

464
01:07:39,116 --> 01:07:42,711
They make me do this, man,
they've taken contol.

465
01:07:44,847 --> 01:07:48,517
Come on, man, don't tell me
you're on of them or something?

466
01:07:54,619 --> 01:07:58,519
- Hey.
- Hey, you wanna come on in?

467
01:08:08,619 --> 01:08:10,719
She was quite upset.

468
01:08:31,914 --> 01:08:33,922
You wanna see her?

469
01:10:24,749 --> 01:10:26,148
Alright...

470
01:10:26,149 --> 01:10:28,380
Push the clutch down.

471
01:10:32,131 --> 01:10:34,982
Come on, come on.

472
01:12:23,407 --> 01:12:26,182
Claire! I need your help.

473
01:12:26,183 --> 01:12:28,171
I need you to help me.

474
01:12:28,172 --> 01:12:30,252
Help me, Claire.

475
01:12:46,446 --> 01:12:48,207
Mom?

476
01:12:49,546 --> 01:12:52,702
Claire! I need your help.

477
01:12:52,956 --> 01:12:55,961
Claire, come down to
the basement, I need you.

478
01:12:57,511 --> 01:12:59,485
Mom?

479
01:12:59,553 --> 01:13:02,558
You have to come down
to the basement, Claire.

480
01:13:04,091 --> 01:13:07,100
Please, don't make me
go down there, mom, please.

481
01:13:07,963 --> 01:13:11,064
Claire, come down here
and help me, please.

482
01:13:11,165 --> 01:13:13,788
Claire, I need help.

483
01:13:13,831 --> 01:13:16,545
Hij komt voor mij nu...

484
01:13:18,944 --> 01:13:21,837
I'm in pain.
Come down.

485
01:13:22,812 --> 01:13:24,708
Help me!

486
01:13:26,264 --> 01:13:28,392
Please, somebody help me.

487
01:13:49,564 --> 01:13:51,073
Mom?

488
01:13:59,625 --> 01:14:02,146
What're you doing down here?

489
01:14:08,002 --> 01:14:09,781
Mom?

490
01:14:13,508 --> 01:14:15,826
Mom, please hurry...

491
01:14:16,253 --> 01:14:18,662
we have to get outta here...

492
01:14:20,408 --> 01:14:22,405
He's coming...

493
01:14:25,451 --> 01:14:27,878
We've got to get outta here...

494
01:14:30,212 --> 01:14:32,689
We can't get outta here.

495
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:36,297
Don't you get it?

496
01:14:36,543 --> 01:14:39,049
You got to relive
what you did,

497
01:14:40,015 --> 01:14:43,270
again and again...

498
01:14:43,396 --> 01:14:45,869
But why are you
doing this, mom?

499
01:14:45,870 --> 01:14:48,498
Stop calling me that.

500
01:14:49,444 --> 01:14:53,609
- You're not my daughter.
- Yes I am, I'm Claire.

501
01:14:53,610 --> 01:14:56,022
Claire is dead.

502
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:59,114
Because you killed her.

503
01:14:59,386 --> 01:15:02,517
Because you killed her,
and Duke!

504
01:15:08,474 --> 01:15:11,051
I didn't do anything.

505
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:14,408
I didn't do anything.

506
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:16,145
You want me to tell you?
Shh...

507
01:15:16,146 --> 01:15:17,584
You wanna know the secret?

508
01:15:17,585 --> 01:15:19,005
I shot him death last week.

509
01:15:19,006 --> 01:15:20,545
Dit alles hier is zever.

510
01:15:20,546 --> 01:15:23,083
- You, me... all of it.
- Duke is dead, right?

511
01:15:23,084 --> 01:15:26,230
- Because he's in hell.
- I'm not, Duke.

512
01:15:26,667 --> 01:15:29,101
Please... I didn't kill him...

513
01:15:29,102 --> 01:15:31,685
Appending all hope
thee who enter.

514
01:15:31,686 --> 01:15:34,868
The only thing that's real,
is what you feel.

515
01:15:34,869 --> 01:15:37,285
- Because he's dead, right?
- Because he's in hell.

516
01:15:37,286 --> 01:15:40,174
I didn't do anything, please.

517
01:15:42,286 --> 01:15:43,874
Please...

518
01:15:46,476 --> 01:15:49,914
I didn't do it!
I didn't do anything!

519
01:15:49,915 --> 01:15:53,579
I haven't done anything.
Please, God, help...

520
01:16:07,819 --> 01:16:09,757
Gute nacht?
