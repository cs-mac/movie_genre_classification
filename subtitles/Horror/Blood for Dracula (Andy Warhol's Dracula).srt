1
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,005
God be praised.
I am victorious.

2
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,642
She has taken her own life.

3
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,600
Her soul cannot be saved.

4
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,841
She is damned.

5
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,809
It is God's law.

6
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,402
Is this my reward
for defending God's church?

7
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,561
Sacrilege!

8
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,361
I renounce God!

9
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,841
I shall rise from my own death...

10
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,608
...to avenge hers
with all the powers of darkness.

11
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,443
The blood is the life...

12
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,405
...and it shall be mine!

13
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,647
For the dead travel fast.

14
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:30,165
How dare you touch him!
He belongs to me!

15
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,643
You yourself never loved.

16
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:40,488
Yes. I too can love.

17
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,730
And I shall love again.

18
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,931
Are we to have nothing tonight?
