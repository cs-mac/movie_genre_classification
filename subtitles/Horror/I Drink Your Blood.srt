1
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,970
Let it be known to all the spirits,

2
00:00:48,053 --> 00:00:51,974
that I am a Capricorn,
living in the 10th house.

3
00:00:52,057 --> 00:00:54,184
The house of our Lord Satan.

4
00:00:55,269 --> 00:00:57,229
Let it be known to all the spirits that I,

5
00:00:57,563 --> 00:00:59,856
Horace Bones, was born into Hell.

6
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:03,110
And reborn to this Earth.

7
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:06,029
Let all the spirits hear.

8
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:10,867
I am the firstborn son of Satan.

9
00:01:11,994 --> 00:01:13,829
He commands my thoughts.

10
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:16,039
I speak his words.

11
00:01:16,582 --> 00:01:18,250
The book of the dead.

12
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:21,753
Sons and daughters of Satan.

13
00:01:23,088 --> 00:01:25,632
Put aside your worldy things.

14
00:01:26,675 --> 00:01:29,219
And come to me.

15
00:01:42,608 --> 00:01:44,318
Let it be known, sons and daughters,

16
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:46,028
that Satan was an acidhead.

17
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,239
Drink from his cup. Pledge yourselves.

18
00:01:50,115 --> 00:01:53,702
And together, we'll all freak out.

19
00:02:32,157 --> 00:02:36,203
Before the Sados
sacrifice, repeat after me:

20
00:02:36,536 --> 00:02:38,664
To the glory of the mighty

21
00:02:38,747 --> 00:02:41,792
one in Hell, I will devote myself.

22
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,919
To the glory of the mighty one

23
00:02:44,002 --> 00:02:47,172
in Hell, I will devote myself.

24
00:02:47,506 --> 00:02:51,218
I will worship him.

25
00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:55,972
I will suffer for him.

26
00:02:56,098 --> 00:02:58,183
I will die for him.

27
00:02:58,308 --> 00:03:00,769
I will die for him.

28
00:03:00,894 --> 00:03:02,938
I will kill for him.

29
00:03:03,063 --> 00:03:05,273
I will kill for him.

30
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:07,150
Oh, father of damnation,

31
00:03:07,275 --> 00:03:10,696
on the eve of destruction,
protect this ritual circle.

32
00:03:11,613 --> 00:03:15,701
And the blood of Sados will
flow freely in your honor.

33
00:03:43,353 --> 00:03:44,229
Horace!

34
00:03:44,771 --> 00:03:45,689
Who's that girl?

35
00:03:47,149 --> 00:03:48,316
<i>' Stop her!</i>

36
00:04:08,628 --> 00:04:10,589
Hey, Horace, it's ok. She's with me.

37
00:04:10,672 --> 00:04:12,674
She's a local kid, she's from around here.

38
00:04:12,758 --> 00:04:14,426
You invited her here?

39
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:15,302
Yeah.

40
00:04:15,385 --> 00:04:16,470
How many times have I got to

41
00:04:16,553 --> 00:04:18,221
say it, no strangers on the scene!

42
00:04:19,055 --> 00:04:20,849
Local girl my ass!

43
00:04:45,165 --> 00:04:47,209
Pete, is that Sylvia?

44
00:04:52,422 --> 00:04:53,548
Sylvia, Sylvia!

45
00:04:53,632 --> 00:04:55,258
Oh my God, what happened to her?

46
00:04:56,301 --> 00:04:58,053
Oh, run and get your grandfather, Pete!

47
00:04:58,887 --> 00:04:59,805
Sylvia!

48
00:05:14,528 --> 00:05:15,987
Son of a bitch!

49
00:05:21,576 --> 00:05:23,203
It's no use, everybody out.

50
00:05:23,328 --> 00:05:25,205
We'll have to make it to
the next town on foot.

51
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,765
Population 40?

52
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:45,892
Soon it's gonna be 48.

53
00:05:46,643 --> 00:05:48,937
Well, guess who's coming to din-din?

54
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,481
Valley Hills. Sounds peaceful.

55
00:05:51,565 --> 00:05:53,191
Maybe I'll drop my kid there.

56
00:05:55,527 --> 00:05:57,195
Hey. Don't wake him.

57
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,015
- She hasn't uttered one
word. She's in shock.

58
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,100
Isn't there a doctor up at the dam site?

59
00:07:09,225 --> 00:07:10,852
Yes, there's a Dr. Oaks.

60
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:13,229
I'm sure Roger would let him come.

61
00:07:13,355 --> 00:07:15,315
Can't you do something for her, Grandpa?

62
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,108
I'm only a veterinarian, Pete.

63
00:07:17,233 --> 00:07:19,152
And your sister's not an animal.

64
00:07:19,235 --> 00:07:21,279
- Somebody certainly
treated her like one.

65
00:07:21,363 --> 00:07:22,656
What do you think happened?

66
00:07:23,615 --> 00:07:25,283
Nobody around here could have done it!

67
00:07:25,617 --> 00:07:26,326
It could be one of the construction

68
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,911
workers up at the dam site.

69
00:07:29,621 --> 00:07:30,956
- Well, I have
to go out there anyway.

70
00:07:32,332 --> 00:07:34,501
I'll tell Roger exactly what's happened.

71
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:36,252
He'll find out who did this.

72
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:38,630
Come on, Pete.

73
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,267
Hey, you! Wait a minute!

74
00:07:52,644 --> 00:07:53,520
Good morning.

75
00:07:54,354 --> 00:07:55,814
I know you've got problems,

76
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:57,315
but so do I, we've got to talk.

77
00:07:58,608 --> 00:08:00,694
- Fellas, you go on. I'll
catch up to you at the dam.

78
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:02,570
Something dreadful has happened.

79
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,920
Roger, I'm very upset!

80
00:08:19,587 --> 00:08:21,297
What's upsetting that can't be fixed?

81
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:24,759
- Pete's sister has been
assaulted and brutally beaten.

82
00:08:24,843 --> 00:08:27,262
And I know one of your men is responsible!

83
00:08:33,226 --> 00:08:34,853
But if the girl's in a state of shock,

84
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:37,147
how do you know one of my men did it?

85
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,606
Who else could it be?

86
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,860
There's nobody left in Valley Hills

87
00:08:41,985 --> 00:08:43,611
because of your damn dam!

88
00:08:43,987 --> 00:08:46,364
Honey, don't take it out on me, huh?

89
00:08:53,705 --> 00:08:56,875
- I'm sorry. I guess
living in a ghost town,

90
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,254
so isolated, so alone, it's
beginning to get to me.

91
00:09:01,337 --> 00:09:04,090
- Look, the dam will be
completed before you know it.

92
00:09:04,174 --> 00:09:05,550
And you'll never be alone again.

93
00:09:05,633 --> 00:09:07,761
Oh, it can't be soon enough.

94
00:09:07,802 --> 00:09:10,805
That bakery is only open
at your request, Mr. Davis.

95
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:12,557
And a good thing, too.

96
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:15,310
When Frank was killed-

97
00:09:15,643 --> 00:09:18,897
- Hey, hey, hey. We agreed
never to discuss the past.

98
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:22,609
Here.

99
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,738
- Mornin', Pete. Let's
have the usual, huh?

100
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,781
<i>Comm' fight up.</i>

101
00:09:27,822 --> 00:09:29,282
What about Sylvia Banner?

102
00:09:31,284 --> 00:09:34,287
- Honey, rape is a little
out of an engineer's domain.

103
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,748
<i>' Big help you are!</i>

104
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,252
- Look, I'll do what I
can, but I'm no detective.

105
00:09:41,628 --> 00:09:42,253
Dr. Oak.

106
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:44,047
Good morning, Mrs. Nash, how are you?

107
00:09:44,172 --> 00:09:45,173
Fine, thank you.

108
00:09:45,757 --> 00:09:47,634
I'm kidnapping your doctor for a while.

109
00:09:47,717 --> 00:09:48,718
Of course.

110
00:09:48,802 --> 00:09:49,636
Something happen in town?

111
00:09:53,598 --> 00:09:57,018
- Hey, the madness of city
life sure psychs me out!

112
00:09:57,685 --> 00:10:00,063
Hippies. Hippies all over our place!

113
00:10:00,146 --> 00:10:03,233
This place is from no place. Nothin'!

114
00:10:03,817 --> 00:10:06,820
- We oughta do 'em like we did
those colored folks, honey.

115
00:10:06,861 --> 00:10:10,073
String 'em up, we should
just string 'em up!

116
00:10:10,657 --> 00:10:11,658
I'm hungry-

117
00:10:11,741 --> 00:10:13,618
What a rathole to get stuck in.

118
00:10:14,953 --> 00:10:15,745
Shit.

119
00:10:16,121 --> 00:10:18,206
You better get used to it,

120
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:20,250
'cause we're going to operate
out of here for a while.

121
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:24,045
- Horace Bones, sometimes
I wonder about you.

122
00:10:25,755 --> 00:10:28,842
Better pray I forget you ever said that.

123
00:10:28,967 --> 00:10:31,261
Nobody wonders about anything but me!

124
00:10:31,386 --> 00:10:34,931
Okay. Okay, what are we gonna do here?

125
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,100
I mean, there's nothing here to steal,

126
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,351
there's no food, nothin'!

127
00:10:38,685 --> 00:10:41,312
- And no fuzz pokin' in
on what we're doing, dig?

128
00:10:41,646 --> 00:10:45,692
Shelley, you're beautiful,
but if you ain't careful,

129
00:10:45,775 --> 00:10:49,821
I'm gonna skin your ass alive!

130
00:11:21,686 --> 00:11:22,770
Good morning.

131
00:11:24,981 --> 00:11:26,816
Are you open for business?

132
00:11:28,651 --> 00:11:29,861
We have a few meat pies left.

133
00:11:29,944 --> 00:11:30,862
<i>' Any milk?</i>

134
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,699
- We have a hungry
bunch waiting out there.

135
00:11:34,782 --> 00:11:37,660
You see, we are all members
of a rock music group,

136
00:11:37,744 --> 00:11:38,870
and we were on our way to Terreton,

137
00:11:38,953 --> 00:11:42,665
to play an engagement,
and our truck broke down.

138
00:11:43,124 --> 00:11:44,125
What a shame.

139
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:45,793
Would you happen to know of a place

140
00:11:45,877 --> 00:11:47,045
we could stay for the night?

141
00:11:47,754 --> 00:11:48,880
My wife isn't feeling so good.

142
00:11:48,963 --> 00:11:50,632
I got one on the way.

143
00:11:50,715 --> 00:11:52,008
Well, the hotel's been boarded up now

144
00:11:52,091 --> 00:11:55,345
for over two years, and the houses

145
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,722
are coming down in another few weeks.

146
00:11:57,805 --> 00:11:58,848
How much?

147
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:01,059
Oh, I'll settle for five dollars.

148
00:12:03,102 --> 00:12:04,604
Thank you very much.

149
00:12:04,896 --> 00:12:07,774
I threw in a few cakes. On the house.

150
00:12:09,817 --> 00:12:11,861
The Lord will bless you, lady!

151
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,655
The Lord will bless you.

152
00:12:34,926 --> 00:12:37,595
Sue-Lin. Pick a house.

153
00:12:38,596 --> 00:12:41,975
Any empty house, the
whole town's up for grabs!

154
00:12:42,767 --> 00:12:44,310
Pick your house, Sue-Lin!

155
00:13:18,678 --> 00:13:19,846
Oh come on, now, why this place

156
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:21,264
when there's so many others?

157
00:13:21,597 --> 00:13:22,724
Are you complaining?

158
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,058
Just,just asking.

159
00:13:42,327 --> 00:13:43,661
It ain't safe to go in there!

160
00:13:43,786 --> 00:13:44,704
Why not?

161
00:13:44,829 --> 00:13:45,580
It's haunted!

162
00:13:45,705 --> 00:13:47,707
Nobody's lived in there
for years and years!

163
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:49,042
It's full of big rats!

164
00:13:49,167 --> 00:13:53,713
So we'll have a
rat hunt! We'll barbecue them!

165
00:13:55,048 --> 00:13:56,966
Whoever catches the most rats will be

166
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:01,262
supreme ruler of Sados
for one night!

167
00:14:23,576 --> 00:14:25,244
Come here you little ugly!

168
00:15:07,995 --> 00:15:09,956
Hey, big man, look at my rats!

169
00:15:22,885 --> 00:15:23,928
Good, Rollo.

170
00:15:26,264 --> 00:15:27,807
Just like shish-kabob.

171
00:15:37,108 --> 00:15:41,154
Let it be known that Rollo Yates is

172
00:15:41,195 --> 00:15:43,739
supreme ruler of Sados for one night.

173
00:15:44,657 --> 00:15:45,867
He can do anything.

174
00:15:47,827 --> 00:15:48,995
I could do anything?

175
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,582
Demand anything?

176
00:15:52,665 --> 00:15:53,207
Mmm-hm.

177
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:55,126
Anything!

178
00:16:00,965 --> 00:16:04,135
Let it be known that I, Rollo Yates,

179
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,972
was created in Hell, and
reborn to this Earth.

180
00:16:08,097 --> 00:16:12,185
I am the firstborn son of Satan.

181
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:17,190
Therefore, Satan is a black man.

182
00:16:18,608 --> 00:16:20,193
He commands my thoughts.

183
00:16:21,652 --> 00:16:25,656
And I conjure you, in
his name, to obey me.

184
00:16:26,073 --> 00:16:28,201
Satan said there is no fear.

185
00:16:28,826 --> 00:16:31,204
If his sons and daughters are
willing to suffer for him,

186
00:16:31,871 --> 00:16:34,916
die for him, and to kill for him...

187
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:39,962
Then there is no fear of pain or blood.

188
00:16:40,796 --> 00:16:44,634
- Pain and blood are
signs of life. Not death.

189
00:16:45,843 --> 00:16:46,719
Right, Sue-Lin.

190
00:16:46,802 --> 00:16:49,013
So I say, let us put it to the test.

191
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:52,642
If there is fear among us,
then we must get rid of it now.

192
00:16:54,018 --> 00:16:56,729
And if there's a cop-out in the group,

193
00:16:56,854 --> 00:17:01,108
then he is not a true
member of Satan's family.

194
00:17:09,742 --> 00:17:13,162
- There's nothing to be
afraid of, dear. There, there.

195
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:15,790
Here, take this.

196
00:17:16,832 --> 00:17:19,585
Doctor's orders. You feel
like talking about it?

197
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,671
Oh, Grandpa!

198
00:17:23,714 --> 00:17:24,924
It was horrible.

199
00:17:25,633 --> 00:17:27,134
You can't turn away from this,

200
00:17:27,218 --> 00:17:28,719
Sylvia, and forget about it.

201
00:17:30,763 --> 00:17:32,056
I'm so ashamed.

202
00:17:32,139 --> 00:17:34,684
- All the more reason why I
should know what happened.

203
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:35,935
Don't you think?

204
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,022
I met this boy.

205
00:17:40,731 --> 00:17:42,108
I caught him stealing a chicken.

206
00:17:44,986 --> 00:17:46,112
His name is Andy.

207
00:17:49,949 --> 00:17:52,201
- You ain't serious about
goin' through with this thing?

208
00:17:56,163 --> 00:17:59,250
He'll kill me! He'll kill me!

209
00:18:04,463 --> 00:18:07,883
Okay, sure. You can carry a
thing up to a certain point,

210
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:09,093
and then I bleed to death!

211
00:18:09,427 --> 00:18:12,888
To the glory of the mighty one in Hell,

212
00:18:12,972 --> 00:18:14,473
I will devote myself.

213
00:18:14,849 --> 00:18:17,893
- To the glory of
the mighty one in Hell,

214
00:18:17,977 --> 00:18:19,895
I will devote myself.

215
00:18:19,979 --> 00:18:21,105
I will worship him.

216
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:23,024
I will worship him.

217
00:18:23,107 --> 00:18:26,569
I will suffer for him.

218
00:18:26,694 --> 00:18:27,987
I will die for him.

219
00:18:28,112 --> 00:18:29,864
I will die for him.

220
00:18:29,989 --> 00:18:31,824
I will kill for him.

221
00:18:31,949 --> 00:18:33,784
I will kill for him.

222
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:35,119
What are you characters, nuts?

223
00:18:35,494 --> 00:18:37,330
Tryin' to scare me like this.

224
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,168
Look, a chicken or a pig is
one thing, but not Shelley!

225
00:19:06,859 --> 00:19:07,902
He's copped out.

226
00:19:07,985 --> 00:19:09,195
Take him up to the attic.

227
00:19:17,036 --> 00:19:18,829
Hey, Grandpa! What are you going to do?

228
00:19:18,954 --> 00:19:21,457
- Go back in the house, Pete,
and don't ask questions!

229
00:19:21,582 --> 00:19:22,708
I'm coming with you!

230
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:23,793
Did you hear me, boy?

231
00:19:23,918 --> 00:19:25,961
You're not to leave your sister alone!

232
00:19:27,713 --> 00:19:30,007
- Grandpa! You don't know
what you're getting into!

233
00:19:30,466 --> 00:19:32,009
There's eight of them, and they're crazy!

234
00:19:32,093 --> 00:19:34,428
- I know what I'm doing, boy,
now go back in the house!

235
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:22,453
- All right,
that's enough. Cut him down.

236
00:21:22,953 --> 00:21:24,955
We have a visitor.

237
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:31,003
Is there something you want?

238
00:21:32,421 --> 00:21:33,881
Is the young man dead?

239
00:21:36,258 --> 00:21:38,844
Drunk, maybe, dead he's not.

240
00:21:39,428 --> 00:21:41,347
I'm surprised you're taken in by all this.

241
00:21:41,889 --> 00:21:44,975
You see, we are a theatrical group,

242
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,852
and we were rehearsing a horror

243
00:21:46,936 --> 00:21:48,729
scene that we perform in theaters.

244
00:21:48,813 --> 00:21:51,023
Are you the one they call Horace?

245
00:21:51,106 --> 00:21:52,191
Among other things.

246
00:21:53,234 --> 00:21:55,069
Are you planning on using that thing?

247
00:21:55,152 --> 00:21:57,196
Yes, you son of a bitch!

248
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:58,989
Around here, we don't fool around with

249
00:21:59,073 --> 00:22:01,659
punks like you, who attack
and beat up young girls!

250
00:22:01,742 --> 00:22:02,910
Are you talking about Sylvia?

251
00:22:02,993 --> 00:22:07,039
Yes, my granddaughter. Outside.

252
00:22:07,414 --> 00:22:08,874
If you're gonna kill me,

253
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:12,086
why don't you do it right here,

254
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:14,171
it's much more convenient!

255
00:22:15,381 --> 00:22:17,424
Uh-oh. Your glasses are dirty.

256
00:22:17,508 --> 00:22:20,636
Let's clean them for you, or
you'll never aim properly.

257
00:22:27,226 --> 00:22:30,187
There you are. Nice and clean.

258
00:22:37,194 --> 00:22:39,947
See if the old geezer's
gun is loaded properly.

259
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:42,491
We wouldn't want a near miss, would we?

260
00:22:42,575 --> 00:22:44,034
Take your hands off me!

261
00:22:45,077 --> 00:22:48,330
Gramps, we want to cooperate with you!

262
00:23:10,436 --> 00:23:12,730
Grandpa! Grandpa!

263
00:23:15,316 --> 00:23:20,321
- Hey. You're pretty
yummy for a dirty old man.

264
00:23:21,614 --> 00:23:26,619
Aw, have a breath freshener, handsome!

265
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:31,874
Makes you stay sweet for hours!

266
00:23:33,334 --> 00:23:34,460
Grandpa!

267
00:23:35,461 --> 00:23:37,046
Horace, let him go!

268
00:23:37,171 --> 00:23:38,339
We can't let him go now.

269
00:23:38,464 --> 00:23:41,008
- If you don't let him go,
we're in for a lot of trouble!

270
00:23:41,091 --> 00:23:42,635
Hey, you! Get up!

271
00:23:44,053 --> 00:23:46,972
Get your ass downstairs and
do something about that kid!

272
00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:51,894
(Tmere, baby!

273
00:23:52,436 --> 00:23:53,729
Where's my grandfather?

274
00:23:54,271 --> 00:23:56,065
Hey, you're cute!

275
00:23:56,649 --> 00:23:58,108
Don't you like girls?

276
00:23:58,525 --> 00:24:00,069
What have you done with my grandfather?

277
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,948
He's inside, having a groovy time!

278
00:24:04,031 --> 00:24:04,907
If you don't send him out,

279
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:07,076
I'm going to call Mr. Davis up at the dam!

280
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:08,202
He's gonna get the law on you!

281
00:24:08,702 --> 00:24:11,580
- Honey, why don't you
come inside with me now?

282
00:24:12,164 --> 00:24:13,624
No, you ain't gettin' me in there!

283
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:15,376
Send my grandfather out!

284
00:24:16,585 --> 00:24:18,587
Cool it, cherub. Wait here.

285
00:24:19,838 --> 00:24:21,548
Hey, midget. Come over here.

286
00:24:22,174 --> 00:24:22,466
No.

287
00:24:22,591 --> 00:24:23,592
Aw, Horace, he's just a kid.

288
00:24:23,717 --> 00:24:25,219
I want to talk to you!

289
00:24:29,223 --> 00:24:30,099
Horace!

290
00:24:30,724 --> 00:24:31,600
Horace!

291
00:24:58,085 --> 00:24:59,336
Horace, let him go!

292
00:25:05,092 --> 00:25:05,926
Here he is.

293
00:25:06,051 --> 00:25:07,261
He's a little drunk, cherub, do you

294
00:25:07,636 --> 00:25:09,013
think you can handle him?

295
00:25:09,138 --> 00:25:09,596
Yes.

296
00:25:09,722 --> 00:25:10,931
Give us a kiss, handsome.

297
00:25:12,224 --> 00:25:13,642
Before you leave.

298
00:25:19,523 --> 00:25:22,109
Come back real soon. Bye!

299
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:17,513
What happened to Grandpa?

300
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:20,849
He went over to the old hotel.

301
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:22,893
He was gonna kill 'em.

302
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:24,395
Instead they got him drunk.

303
00:27:24,478 --> 00:27:27,439
He's not drunk, stupid. He's been doped!

304
00:27:27,523 --> 00:27:28,107
Huh?

305
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,734
With that stuff that they call LSD.

306
00:27:30,818 --> 00:27:32,069
The whole bunch take it.

307
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:34,405
- What does it do, that
I whatever you call it?

308
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:36,365
Boy, you really don't know anything.

309
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:38,409
It makes a person crazy.

310
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:41,328
- Wow. Is that what
they've done to Grandpa?

311
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:46,333
Come on, Grandpa. Come on.

312
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:17,799
Pete, what did you do?

313
00:29:17,883 --> 00:29:18,425
Nothing!

314
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:20,928
- Don't lie to me! What
was that shot I just heard?

315
00:29:21,303 --> 00:29:22,346
Don't get excited.

316
00:29:23,222 --> 00:29:26,225
I just shot at a mad dog
that was snooping around.

317
00:29:26,308 --> 00:29:27,809
How would you know if it's mad?

318
00:29:28,227 --> 00:29:29,811
I may not know about that L stuff that

319
00:29:29,895 --> 00:29:33,023
makes you crazy, but I know about rabies.

320
00:29:33,232 --> 00:29:35,150
Grandpa told me all about it.

321
00:29:36,068 --> 00:29:37,110
Well, did you kill it?

322
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:40,906
- No, I don't think so,
but I scared it off.

323
00:29:41,031 --> 00:29:43,200
- Well, that thing has
gotta be caught and killed.

324
00:29:49,873 --> 00:29:52,000
I'm gonna go upstairs and
I'm gonna stay with Grandpa.

325
00:30:17,067 --> 00:30:18,402
He wouldn't do the same for you.

326
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:21,863
- And what happens if he
dies? We're all responsible.

327
00:30:22,072 --> 00:30:23,865
So we dump him. No loss.

328
00:30:23,991 --> 00:30:25,701
He's a troublemaker anyway.

329
00:30:25,993 --> 00:30:27,369
Nobody will miss him.

330
00:32:39,209 --> 00:32:40,377
Good morning, Pete.

331
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:41,878
Good morning.

332
00:32:54,891 --> 00:32:55,684
How's Sylvia?

333
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:56,935
Oh, she won't be in today.

334
00:32:57,811 --> 00:32:59,813
But I can help you with
some of the chores.

335
00:33:07,863 --> 00:33:09,030
Is anything wrong, Pete?

336
00:33:09,281 --> 00:33:10,198
No.

337
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:12,367
You don't seem to be in a very talkative

338
00:33:12,743 --> 00:33:13,744
mood this morning.

339
00:33:14,202 --> 00:33:16,413
Let's see, 12, 24, 25...

340
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:18,999
That oughta be enough.

341
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,209
Maybe you oughta make another dozen.

342
00:33:21,877 --> 00:33:24,171
For those folks that
moved into the old hotel.

343
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,881
You mean the hippie group?

344
00:33:25,964 --> 00:33:27,215
They took over the old hotel?

345
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:29,092
Yeah, and they're gonna be

346
00:33:29,176 --> 00:33:30,677
looking for something to eat today.

347
00:33:32,763 --> 00:33:35,098
- Well, I guess we don't
want anybody to starve.

348
00:34:30,612 --> 00:34:31,238
Mornin'.

349
00:34:31,321 --> 00:34:32,239
Mornin' boy.

350
00:34:32,906 --> 00:34:33,824
Hey, what you got to eat?

351
00:34:34,157 --> 00:34:35,867
We have beef and chicken pies.

352
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,369
We can let you have a dozen.

353
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:41,748
- Meat pies for breakfast?
I don't think so.

354
00:34:41,873 --> 00:34:43,291
Hey, don't you have anything else?

355
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:44,876
The meat pies are ready now.

356
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:46,837
Hot, right out of the oven.

357
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:48,797
We got a special on 'em.

358
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:51,758
A quarter apiece, if you take a dozen.

359
00:34:54,886 --> 00:34:56,346
All right, we'll take the meat pies.

360
00:34:56,888 --> 00:34:58,348
Mmm, they look yummy.

361
00:34:58,682 --> 00:34:59,933
No, no! Let me.

362
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:03,311
We'll make a baker out of you yet, Pete.

363
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:06,022
Nope, I'm gonna be a veterinarian.

364
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:12,821
How you feeling?

365
00:35:16,241 --> 00:35:17,742
Something's got to be done about

366
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:20,203
that gang of savage hyenas.

367
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:27,043
- Pete said that he saw
a mad dog last night.

368
00:35:27,752 --> 00:35:28,962
Not with rabies?

369
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:31,214
Yep, that's what he said.

370
00:35:31,965 --> 00:35:33,884
- Well, I'd better
report that immediately.

371
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:46,062
Mildred's Bakery. Yes, Dr. Banner.

372
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:54,988
No, he didn't. Pete never
said a word about it.

373
00:35:55,071 --> 00:35:56,907
I knew he was worried about something,

374
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,367
but I thought it was because
of what happened to Sylvia.

375
00:36:05,874 --> 00:36:08,919
Pete, why didn't you tell
me about the rabid dog?

376
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,795
It should be reported immediately.

377
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:12,380
Because.

378
00:36:13,381 --> 00:36:14,215
Because why?

379
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:17,636
Because I killed it this morning.

380
00:36:24,309 --> 00:36:25,143
Mildred?

381
00:36:25,268 --> 00:36:25,810
Yes?

382
00:36:25,936 --> 00:36:28,063
What happens if a human gets rabies?

383
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:31,858
They go insane and die. Why do you ask?

384
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:34,110
No reason. Just curious.

385
00:36:39,282 --> 00:36:40,283
Meat pies again?

386
00:36:40,617 --> 00:36:41,910
Well, that's all they had, hick.

387
00:36:42,827 --> 00:36:44,788
You want anything else,
you gotta walk eight miles.

388
00:36:44,871 --> 00:36:46,456
If you're gonna complain, don't eat.

389
00:36:49,918 --> 00:36:51,002
All right, more for us.

390
00:37:52,647 --> 00:37:54,899
- Hey, fatso. You
aren't gonna finish that?

391
00:37:55,025 --> 00:37:56,693
Blech. Tastes funny.

392
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,319
Well, they're baked fresh this morning.

393
00:37:58,445 --> 00:37:59,654
I saw it come out of the oven.

394
00:37:59,779 --> 00:38:00,572
She probably has

395
00:38:00,697 --> 00:38:02,657
morning sickness, don't you think?

396
00:38:05,535 --> 00:38:06,745
So starve.

397
00:38:14,252 --> 00:38:15,086
Hi.

398
00:38:18,256 --> 00:38:19,299
What do you want?

399
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:21,009
I got worried about you.

400
00:38:21,509 --> 00:38:22,343
How do you feel?

401
00:38:23,386 --> 00:38:24,137
I'll live.

402
00:38:26,514 --> 00:38:29,059
- Listen, Sylvia, I'm awful
sorry for what happened.

403
00:38:29,142 --> 00:38:29,934
Honest, I-

404
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:32,437
A lot of good that does now.

405
00:38:37,984 --> 00:38:40,195
- Will you listen? I'm gonna
leave that idiot group.

406
00:38:40,862 --> 00:38:42,238
They're no damn good, anyhow.

407
00:38:44,115 --> 00:38:44,866
Well, how'd you get mixed up

408
00:38:44,991 --> 00:38:46,326
with them in the first place?

409
00:38:46,785 --> 00:38:47,702
Kicks, that's all.

410
00:38:47,827 --> 00:38:48,870
Some kicks.

411
00:38:49,871 --> 00:38:51,164
What are they supposed to be?

412
00:38:51,289 --> 00:38:53,917
Sados. The sons and daughters of Satan.

413
00:38:54,918 --> 00:38:56,211
Not really, it's all fake.

414
00:38:56,336 --> 00:38:57,378
But it sounds kinky.

415
00:38:57,504 --> 00:39:01,549
Satan? I guess you don't believe in God.

416
00:39:02,467 --> 00:39:05,011
I don't know. That's a fact, Sylvia.

417
00:39:06,096 --> 00:39:08,014
He sure doesn't treat us like He should.

418
00:39:21,736 --> 00:39:22,862
Very funny.

419
00:39:30,578 --> 00:39:32,664
God, I feel like I'm suffocating.

420
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:34,791
Such a muggy day-

421
00:39:34,916 --> 00:39:35,959
Not the weather.

422
00:39:36,084 --> 00:39:38,503
The spirit of evil that's gotten into you.

423
00:39:38,628 --> 00:39:40,338
You mean you ain't hot from the heat?

424
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:42,799
I don't feel anything.

425
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:45,260
I'm at peace with my father.

426
00:39:46,261 --> 00:39:47,470
So I'm carrying his baby,

427
00:39:47,595 --> 00:39:49,097
so what more does the son of a...

428
00:39:50,056 --> 00:39:51,516
The little devil want?

429
00:39:54,644 --> 00:39:57,564
- I got a pain in my
gut. What does that mean?

430
00:39:57,647 --> 00:39:59,232
Cramps.

431
00:39:59,315 --> 00:40:00,900
Devil's cramps, huh?

432
00:40:01,609 --> 00:40:03,945
He comes in mysterious ways, Rollo.

433
00:40:04,028 --> 00:40:05,947
None of us feel well, Horace.

434
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,824
The food must've been spoiled.

435
00:40:07,907 --> 00:40:08,950
Yeah, they sure were anxious to

436
00:40:09,033 --> 00:40:10,743
unload those meat pies off on us.

437
00:40:11,035 --> 00:40:12,662
I think they done it deliberately.

438
00:40:14,038 --> 00:40:14,998
Wait a minute.

439
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:19,502
Wait a minute!

440
00:40:20,712 --> 00:40:22,046
Now I get the picture.

441
00:40:23,173 --> 00:40:25,300
They were trying to get
even with us for last night.

442
00:40:27,677 --> 00:40:31,389
So tonight, we wreck the bakery!

443
00:40:31,514 --> 00:40:32,724
Not tonight!

444
00:40:32,849 --> 00:40:35,894
Unless you want us throwing
up all over the place.

445
00:40:40,023 --> 00:40:42,984
There's one way of curing a bellyache.

446
00:40:43,067 --> 00:40:43,943
Horace?

447
00:40:55,955 --> 00:40:58,499
- God damn it! We need the
material, and we need it now!

448
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:01,044
- Look, we're working around
it, but it's holding us back!

449
00:41:04,005 --> 00:41:06,257
- Look, you see what you can
do and get back to me, huh?

450
00:41:10,094 --> 00:41:12,055
Sorry, honey, I can't leave now.

451
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:15,892
- Then I'll wait. I can't go
into town, I'd be too afraid.

452
00:41:16,017 --> 00:41:18,228
- Are you sure Dr. Banner
wasn't exaggerating?

453
00:41:18,353 --> 00:41:20,605
You know, he is an old
man, and he may be senile.

454
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:23,650
What about Sylvia? She was badly beaten!

455
00:41:23,775 --> 00:41:24,901
All right, all right, I'll buy that,

456
00:41:25,026 --> 00:41:27,195
but all this crap about a
devil's cult sacrificing humans-

457
00:41:27,278 --> 00:41:29,989
Roger, sometimes you infuriate me!

458
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,077
Now, wait a minute, huh?

459
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:36,871
The stupid pneumatic drill is more

460
00:41:36,955 --> 00:41:38,373
important to you than my safety.

461
00:41:38,456 --> 00:41:39,624
I didn't say I wouldn't go into town.

462
00:41:39,707 --> 00:41:41,167
Oh, forget it! It'll soon be dark,

463
00:41:41,251 --> 00:41:42,627
and I wanna get home before then.

464
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,128
Look, I'll be in as soon as I can.

465
00:41:45,046 --> 00:41:48,716
And I still love you. Even
if you are a stubborn bitch.

466
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,011
Don't bother, Mr. Davis. Just drop dead.

467
00:43:42,246 --> 00:43:43,247
' No!

468
00:43:59,889 --> 00:44:02,058
You're mad, you son of a bitch!

469
00:45:29,854 --> 00:45:32,106
- On the eve of
destruction, blood will flow

470
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:35,109
freely in your honor, father of Hell.

471
00:49:00,981 --> 00:49:03,275
Hold up, boy. Sit down.

472
00:49:22,211 --> 00:49:23,045
Come in, Mrs. Nash.

473
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:25,131
We're just sitting down to
supper, won't you join us?

474
00:49:25,172 --> 00:49:27,675
- I've got to use your
phone. I must reach Roger.

475
00:49:29,176 --> 00:49:31,262
Something terrible is happening in town.

476
00:49:42,022 --> 00:49:43,023
No, turn the light out!

477
00:49:44,108 --> 00:49:46,694
It's okay. What are you doing here?

478
00:49:47,153 --> 00:49:49,321
- Well, listen, I'm in
trouble, you gotta help me.

479
00:49:52,324 --> 00:49:54,660
- Okay, listen. Go and
wait out in the barn,

480
00:49:54,744 --> 00:49:56,746
and I'll be out therejust
as soon as I can, okay?

481
00:50:02,251 --> 00:50:03,127
Here.

482
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:23,230
Hey. Hey, Ed. Come here.

483
00:50:24,273 --> 00:50:25,691
Take the truck and drive into town.

484
00:50:26,108 --> 00:50:27,234
Take Joe here and a few
of the boys with you.

485
00:50:27,318 --> 00:50:28,235
" What's up?

486
00:50:28,277 --> 00:50:29,737
I'm not sure, there might be trouble.

487
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:32,072
Check the bakery. Make
sure Mildred Nash is okay,

488
00:50:32,156 --> 00:50:33,991
and leave one of the boys with
her until I can get there.

489
00:50:34,074 --> 00:50:35,159
Then check the old hotel.

490
00:50:35,242 --> 00:50:36,202
Can't you tell us anything more?

491
00:50:36,285 --> 00:50:38,704
- Mrs. Nash told me a
wild group of hippies

492
00:50:38,788 --> 00:50:41,123
busted into the hotel
and are raising hell.

493
00:50:41,207 --> 00:50:42,124
We can flatten 'em, huh?

494
00:50:42,833 --> 00:50:43,751
Here, better take this.

495
00:50:44,585 --> 00:50:45,252
In case there's any trouble.

496
00:50:46,754 --> 00:50:47,630
That serious, huh?

497
00:50:48,088 --> 00:50:49,131
I'm not sure.

498
00:51:15,032 --> 00:51:16,659
Andy, what's happened?

499
00:52:59,377 --> 00:53:01,713
- My car is right over
here in the driveway.

500
00:53:02,714 --> 00:53:04,799
- Come along with
that flashlight, will you, Pete?

501
00:53:14,809 --> 00:53:15,935
Is that real blood?

502
00:53:15,977 --> 00:53:17,437
God's sake, don't touch it!

503
00:53:44,922 --> 00:53:45,923
What's the trouble?

504
00:53:46,924 --> 00:53:47,884
No trouble, handsome.

505
00:53:48,593 --> 00:53:49,302
Where you headin'?

506
00:53:50,511 --> 00:53:51,346
Valley Hills.

507
00:53:51,929 --> 00:53:52,889
Give a girl a lift?

508
00:53:53,556 --> 00:53:54,474
Hop in the back.

509
00:53:56,768 --> 00:53:58,311
Ooh, what's a little lady like you

510
00:53:58,394 --> 00:53:59,729
doing all alone on a road?

511
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,273
Some black creep was following me.

512
00:54:02,774 --> 00:54:04,650
Oh, well you just get your

513
00:54:04,734 --> 00:54:06,944
pretty little ass in here, honey,

514
00:54:07,278 --> 00:54:08,654
and we'll protect you.

515
00:54:08,738 --> 00:54:10,365
Oh, yeah.

516
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:12,992
Hey, what are you guys up m?

517
00:54:13,326 --> 00:54:15,203
Anything you're up to, honey.

518
00:54:15,453 --> 00:54:16,621
Okay, Ed!

519
00:54:24,504 --> 00:54:26,339
Hey, Matt. Look around, huh?

520
00:54:26,464 --> 00:54:27,382
I'll be right back.

521
00:54:27,507 --> 00:54:29,634
Okay, Ed. Let's go.

522
00:54:29,717 --> 00:54:31,552
<i>Here you g0, baby'- !</i>

523
00:54:43,439 --> 00:54:45,775
- Hey, you guys ain't
gonna leave me out here?

524
00:54:45,858 --> 00:54:47,860
- Oh, we're just gonna
have a look around, honey,

525
00:54:47,944 --> 00:54:49,195
we'll be right back.

526
00:54:49,278 --> 00:54:51,030
There's nothin' but rats in there.

527
00:54:51,697 --> 00:54:53,449
We can have more fun outside.

528
00:54:56,577 --> 00:54:57,870
What's the big rush?

529
00:54:58,204 --> 00:55:01,290
Yeah. Damn rats can wait!

530
00:55:04,961 --> 00:55:07,672
Come on, rats. I've some cheese for ya!

531
00:55:07,755 --> 00:55:08,798
Come on, rats!

532
00:55:38,244 --> 00:55:39,454
That must be Davis calling now.

533
00:55:40,246 --> 00:55:41,330
There's nobody here, man.

534
00:55:42,081 --> 00:55:42,957
Let's go, huh?

535
00:55:43,249 --> 00:55:44,125
<i>, okay-</i>

536
00:55:56,345 --> 00:55:58,473
Hey, Matt! Where are you?

537
00:56:00,099 --> 00:56:01,392
Where the hell did he go to?

538
00:56:02,018 --> 00:56:04,228
I knew I never should
have picked up that broad!

539
00:56:28,669 --> 00:56:29,712
God damn!

540
00:56:35,384 --> 00:56:36,928
Somebody's living here, all right.

541
00:56:43,935 --> 00:56:44,769
Shit!

542
00:56:44,852 --> 00:56:45,478
What?

543
00:56:46,103 --> 00:56:46,771
Look!

544
00:56:49,482 --> 00:56:50,274
Jesus.

545
00:56:51,859 --> 00:56:52,902
Don't look at it.

546
00:56:54,362 --> 00:56:56,364
Oh man, come on, let's get out of here!

547
00:56:57,198 --> 00:56:58,241
- Wait a minute.
- It's a body!

548
00:56:58,366 --> 00:57:00,660
- Get a hold of yourself!
Hold it! Look at me!

549
00:57:00,785 --> 00:57:02,703
We were supposed to check
this place out, right?

550
00:57:02,828 --> 00:57:04,288
Well, I ain't doin' it alone!

551
00:57:05,915 --> 00:57:06,749
Come on!

552
00:59:00,488 --> 00:59:01,614
Wait a minute.

553
00:59:03,366 --> 00:59:04,033
Listen.

554
00:59:04,867 --> 00:59:06,369
Somebody's coming out of the house.

555
00:59:06,619 --> 00:59:07,995
Come on, let's go upstairs.

556
00:59:14,919 --> 00:59:16,003
They're comin' in the barn.

557
00:59:16,087 --> 00:59:17,129
Ssh! Don't move.

558
00:59:34,355 --> 00:59:35,815
Get away from him, Sylvia!

559
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:37,900
Pete, what are you doin' out here?

560
00:59:38,359 --> 00:59:40,319
Are you tryin' to spy on me?

561
00:59:40,528 --> 00:59:41,987
No, I'm tryin' to tell you something!

562
00:59:42,321 --> 00:59:43,823
He's diseased with rabies!

563
00:59:43,906 --> 00:59:45,241
Would you stop talkin' silly?

564
00:59:45,324 --> 00:59:46,450
Get back to bed!

565
00:59:46,534 --> 00:59:49,829
- Honest, Sylvia! I wouldn't
kid about somethin' like that!

566
00:59:50,454 --> 00:59:52,957
I took blood from the rabid dog I killed,

567
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:55,459
then contaminated the meat
pies I sold to his group!

568
00:59:56,335 --> 00:59:58,295
Pete, what are you talkin' about?

569
00:59:58,379 --> 00:59:59,338
It's the truth!

570
00:59:59,422 --> 01:00:02,299
I wanted to pay 'em back for
what they did to Grandpa!

571
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,385
Pete, Pete, listen to me!

572
01:00:09,014 --> 01:00:10,433
If what you say is true,
Pete, then chances are

573
01:00:10,558 --> 01:00:12,393
pretty good that I
ain't been contaminated.

574
01:00:13,144 --> 01:00:15,688
My God, I didn't eat any
of those pies, I swear it!

575
01:00:15,813 --> 01:00:17,314
And I was on the outs of the group,

576
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,567
so I stayed clear of 'em
the whole day through.

577
01:00:19,692 --> 01:00:21,736
That's a fact, really! Sylvia...

578
01:00:22,611 --> 01:00:25,281
Listen, I ain't had any
close contact with them

579
01:00:25,406 --> 01:00:27,491
since what they did to
your old man last night.

580
01:00:28,242 --> 01:00:30,369
Do you have any idea what you've done?

581
01:00:32,246 --> 01:00:34,331
Yes, but I hope you won't tell Grandpa.

582
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:37,376
I only told you because
I was worried about you.

583
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:38,878
Oh, Pete.

584
01:00:47,636 --> 01:00:49,263
Let's g0, bOYS!

585
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:55,227
- Please don't leave me
alone! Take me with you!

586
01:00:55,311 --> 01:00:56,645
Sure, why not?

587
01:00:56,771 --> 01:01:00,357
Some of the boys, they
just can't appreciate you!

588
01:01:30,513 --> 01:01:31,472
Hello, Mr. Davis. Come in.

589
01:01:31,555 --> 01:01:33,349
Doc, is Mildred Nash here?

590
01:01:33,432 --> 01:01:36,393
Yes, she is. She's upstairs. Sleeping.

591
01:01:36,477 --> 01:01:37,311
Well, don't disturb her,

592
01:01:37,394 --> 01:01:38,938
I just was very worried about her.

593
01:01:39,271 --> 01:01:40,356
Well, I'm very glad you are here.

594
01:01:40,606 --> 01:01:42,525
We have to have a serious talk.

595
01:01:42,608 --> 01:01:44,360
Has something happened to Mildred?

596
01:01:44,443 --> 01:01:46,403
No, Mrs. Nash is all right.

597
01:01:46,862 --> 01:01:48,447
But something has happened.

598
01:01:48,572 --> 01:01:51,408
Something that endangers
this entire valley.

599
01:02:00,835 --> 01:02:05,297
Construction workers! Rise and unite!

600
01:02:05,673 --> 01:02:08,342
Look at what we have here!

601
01:02:08,759 --> 01:02:11,470
See this construction!

602
01:02:11,846 --> 01:02:15,724
And she's waitin' to be riveted! Woo!

603
01:02:28,779 --> 01:02:31,490
- Per Mildred's description
of the man who attacked her,

604
01:02:31,574 --> 01:02:33,492
I'm inclined to believe he has rabies.

605
01:02:34,493 --> 01:02:34,869
Rabies?

606
01:02:34,994 --> 01:02:36,620
Hydrophobia, the same thing.

607
01:02:36,745 --> 01:02:38,706
Now, I don't have to tell
you, it's highly infectious.

608
01:02:39,582 --> 01:02:40,833
It's also fatal, isn't it?

609
01:02:41,292 --> 01:02:42,626
You're damn right, it is.

610
01:02:42,751 --> 01:02:45,462
It's a disease that attacks
the central nervous system

611
01:02:45,588 --> 01:02:48,424
in all flesh-eating animals,
including us humans.

612
01:02:48,549 --> 01:02:50,593
It is transmitted upon contact,

613
01:02:50,718 --> 01:02:53,429
symptoms begin to show almost immediately,

614
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:55,014
depending on the person's condition.

615
01:02:55,556 --> 01:02:56,599
What are the symptoms?

616
01:02:56,891 --> 01:02:59,894
- Hydrophobia, as
characterized by choking,

617
01:02:59,977 --> 01:03:02,354
convulsions, frothing of the mouth.

618
01:03:03,439 --> 01:03:07,026
Burning fever, an uncontrollable thirst,

619
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:09,403
but an inability to swallow,

620
01:03:09,486 --> 01:03:11,697
and a fear of water that borders on panic.

621
01:03:23,542 --> 01:03:25,377
Hey, man. Leave her alone.

622
01:03:25,502 --> 01:03:26,712
Can't you see she's having a fit?

623
01:03:30,424 --> 01:03:31,342
God damn it, don't you see

624
01:03:31,467 --> 01:03:32,635
what the hell she did to me?

625
01:03:34,678 --> 01:03:36,680
This time I'm really gonna cool her ass.

626
01:03:36,805 --> 01:03:37,765
No, man!

627
01:04:09,421 --> 01:04:11,590
- How soon before death
overtakes the victim?

628
01:04:12,383 --> 01:04:14,426
That depends on the constitution.

629
01:04:14,802 --> 01:04:16,428
But it's a blessing when it comes.

630
01:04:35,572 --> 01:04:37,992
But before that it's like the
devil takes over the body,

631
01:04:38,325 --> 01:04:40,536
the mind reduced to
the level of an animal,

632
01:04:40,619 --> 01:04:42,413
capable of the most savage acts.

633
01:04:42,496 --> 01:04:45,499
The color of red triggers
an excitement in the mind,

634
01:04:45,582 --> 01:04:48,794
and of course, the fear
of water and clear liquid

635
01:04:48,877 --> 01:04:52,423
produces an almost fanatical
craving for raw flesh.

636
01:04:52,506 --> 01:04:55,634
What worries me is the fact
that this here hippie group

637
01:04:55,676 --> 01:04:58,262
is on hard drugs, coupled
with the reaction to

638
01:04:58,345 --> 01:04:59,638
the rabies virus, it's bound to

639
01:04:59,722 --> 01:05:02,474
cause unthinkable complications.

640
01:05:09,565 --> 01:05:10,733
Come in. Come in.

641
01:05:10,858 --> 01:05:12,526
Sit down. Come on.

642
01:05:16,488 --> 01:05:19,575
My dear girl, you should be in
a hospital in your condition.

643
01:05:19,616 --> 01:05:22,786
- Oh, I'm okay. But we've been
walkin' for miles it seems,

644
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:25,789
and we ain't had anything
to eat, but that's all.

645
01:05:26,665 --> 01:05:28,667
Carrie, that ain't nice, now put it back!

646
01:05:29,626 --> 01:05:31,587
Well, she don't know better, she's a mute.

647
01:05:32,463 --> 01:05:34,631
Well, what am I standing here for?

648
01:05:34,715 --> 01:05:36,842
The least I can do is get
you two something to eat.

649
01:05:36,925 --> 01:05:39,595
Oh, anything. Anything'll be fine.

650
01:06:52,876 --> 01:06:54,795
Davis. Davis!

651
01:06:56,547 --> 01:06:57,714
Oh, good morning, Doc.

652
01:06:57,756 --> 01:06:59,758
- We're in for a hell of a
lot of trouble this morning.

653
01:07:00,509 --> 01:07:01,385
What is it?

654
01:07:01,468 --> 01:07:03,720
- You better come with me and
see for yourself. Down here.

655
01:07:23,657 --> 01:07:24,783
Down there, Davis.

656
01:07:25,701 --> 01:07:27,244
We found her that way.

657
01:07:30,539 --> 01:07:31,623
I don't know how to explain it,

658
01:07:31,748 --> 01:07:33,208
I don't even know what to put to report.

659
01:07:33,792 --> 01:07:34,793
Wait a minute.

660
01:07:55,647 --> 01:07:57,482
Davis, I've gotta call the Red Cross.

661
01:07:57,816 --> 01:07:59,401
We're in a state of emergency.

662
01:08:07,701 --> 01:08:08,911
Jesus Christ!

663
01:08:13,582 --> 01:08:14,875
No, Davis. There's too many.

664
01:08:15,751 --> 01:08:17,461
Come on, we'll be much
safer down at the quarry!

665
01:08:17,544 --> 01:08:18,420
Come on!

666
01:10:06,903 --> 01:10:08,196
Hey, you!

667
01:10:08,739 --> 01:10:11,241
What the hell do you think you're doin'?

668
01:10:14,244 --> 01:10:15,829
Put that goddamn thing down!

669
01:11:28,985 --> 01:11:29,653
<i>' MOIIy!</i>

670
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,238
<i>_ Oh:</i>

671
01:11:31,321 --> 01:11:32,155
Stay away from us, Molly.

672
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:32,989
Don't come any closer.

673
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:34,950
What's wrong?

674
01:11:36,076 --> 01:11:38,078
Oh, Andy, I'm so desperate.

675
01:11:40,914 --> 01:11:41,665
Don't you know?

676
01:11:41,748 --> 01:11:42,499
What?

677
01:11:42,874 --> 01:11:44,835
- Honey, you've got rabies,
you're contaminated,

678
01:11:44,918 --> 01:11:46,211
the whole group has it!

679
01:11:46,503 --> 01:11:47,421
Rabies?

680
01:11:49,631 --> 01:11:51,550
You mean like dogs?

681
01:11:54,678 --> 01:11:56,388
Oh my God!

682
01:11:58,140 --> 01:11:59,808
Andy, help me!

683
01:11:59,891 --> 01:12:02,602
Help me, get me to a
hospital, I'm all alone!

684
01:12:03,145 --> 01:12:04,479
Stay away!

685
01:12:09,443 --> 01:12:10,777
Baby, I'm sorry.

686
01:12:12,195 --> 01:12:12,863
It's hopeless.

687
01:12:18,118 --> 01:12:19,244
MY baby!

688
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:23,206
Poor little bastard.

689
01:14:50,770 --> 01:14:52,981
Oh, Roger! I'm so glad you're here!

690
01:14:53,857 --> 01:14:54,816
That awful woman-

691
01:14:54,941 --> 01:14:56,568
- Now, you listen
to me, and listen carefully.

692
01:14:56,693 --> 01:14:58,069
All hell broke loose up at the dam,

693
01:14:58,194 --> 01:14:59,237
and I've gotta get help!

694
01:15:02,741 --> 01:15:03,742
Lock all the doors and windows,

695
01:15:03,867 --> 01:15:05,660
and don't let anybody in, anybody!

696
01:15:06,328 --> 01:15:07,829
You can't be sure who's been contaminated.

697
01:15:07,954 --> 01:15:08,622
I'm going with you.

698
01:15:08,747 --> 01:15:10,165
No, it's too dangerous on the road

699
01:15:10,248 --> 01:15:11,458
between here and the highway.

700
01:15:12,125 --> 01:15:13,418
I'm not even sure I can get through.

701
01:15:13,501 --> 01:15:15,337
Then I'll go stay with Dr. Banner.

702
01:15:57,712 --> 01:16:00,423
- You've got to stay here and
wait for Dr. Oaks to call.

703
01:16:00,882 --> 01:16:02,092
You'd better take this.

704
01:16:02,884 --> 01:16:03,718
Oh, Roger!

705
01:16:04,177 --> 01:16:05,679
Don't hesitate to use it.

706
01:16:10,684 --> 01:16:12,310
I could hide in the cellar.

707
01:16:13,311 --> 01:16:14,646
That would be the safest place.

708
01:16:16,314 --> 01:16:17,524
Oh, Roger, be careful!

709
01:17:14,497 --> 01:17:15,373
<i>, Die!</i>

710
01:19:10,405 --> 01:19:12,323
Open the door, Mrs. Nash!

711
01:19:12,407 --> 01:19:13,324
Open up!

712
01:19:14,826 --> 01:19:15,618
Open Up!

713
01:19:18,413 --> 01:19:20,039
For God's sake, open the door!

714
01:19:32,427 --> 01:19:33,720
Open the door, Mrs. Nash!

715
01:19:35,471 --> 01:19:36,431
Open up!

716
01:19:52,488 --> 01:19:53,823
Oh, God! Let us in!

717
01:19:56,618 --> 01:19:58,661
- Gimmie that
chair. You don't need that!

718
01:22:54,879 --> 01:22:57,381
Lock the doors! I'll lock the windows!

719
01:24:09,245 --> 01:24:10,538
What the hell are you doing?

720
01:24:10,621 --> 01:24:11,789
Look, I've got orders to kill on sight.

721
01:24:11,873 --> 01:24:13,499
There may be a woman in that car!

722
01:24:13,583 --> 01:24:14,625
Hold your fire!

723
01:24:21,257 --> 01:24:21,924
Come on, Pete boy!

724
01:24:28,598 --> 01:24:30,683
Go. Mildred!
