00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,800
- Thanks for taking us to the movies.
- You're welcome, Donna.

3
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,200
See you at school tomorrow.

4
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,000
I'll wait for you at cheerleading tryouts.

5
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,300
Yeah, I think I'm gonna skip it this year.

6
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,900
Why?

7
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,500
Well, my mom doesn't think
it's such a good idea, you know,

8
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,200
- with all that's happened.
- She's probably right.

9
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,700
There's only one spot left on the team,
and one of us has to get it

10
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,600
so that Crissy doesn't.

11
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,000
What did that poor girl do to you two
to make you hate her so?

12
00:03:04,035 --> 00:03:05,300
Where do you want me to start?

13
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,300
See you tomorrow. Bye.

14
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,500
Bye.

15
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,300
<i>They had an 8 and 2 record in 1941,
when they won the Rose Bowl at Duke.</i>

16
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm home.

17
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,400
Dad?

18
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,700
Joey?

19
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,100
I almost killed myself on this!

20
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,900
Joey?

21
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,500
Did you hear me, butthole?

22
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,400
Hey!

23
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,000
Turn the TV down.

24
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,900
Where is she?

25
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,800
Where is she?

26
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,500
She's not here!

27
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,000
I swear to God!

28
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,200
Oh, help me, somebody!

29
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,800
Please, don't.

30
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,000
She belongs to me.

31
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,900
Where is she?

32
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,400
- I know you know, you're her mother.
- No!

33
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,300
Tell me where she is!

34
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,500
She's at a sleepover.

35
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,100
Please, don't.

36
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,900
Help me! Help me! Please, stop! Stop!

37
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,000
Help me!

38
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,900
I did it for us.

39
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,700
No!

40
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,700
And then what happens?

41
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,500
And then I wake up, just like I always did.

42
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,765
Well, like I told you before,

43
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,600
the nightmare is an associate form
of reliving the real experience.

44
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,300
It's to be expected.

45
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,600
I know.

46
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,600
I just...
They went away for such a long time.

47
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,000
I can't believe they're back.

48
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,700
Donna, it's going to take
more than three years.

49
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,000
You're doing amazingly well.

50
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,700
Think of him only as a phantom to you now.

51
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,600
He was caught and put away forever

52
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,200
2,300 miles away.

53
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,700
The only place that he can hurt you
is in your dreams.

54
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,900
I just thought they stopped.

55
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,500
Psychological trauma often heightens
during times of transition.

56
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,100
And you don't need me to tell you
that your life is in transition.

57
00:07:12,135 --> 00:07:15,400
High school is coming to an end,
college in the fall.

58
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,500
The uncertainty
that comes with being an adult.

59
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,800
The memories of that night
will come and go and fade with time,

60
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,100
but you will never forget it.

61
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,065
Just like you'll never forget
tomorrow night.

62
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,500
But hopefully that will be a memory
that you'll always want to remember.

63
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,500
So, tell me,

64
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,200
what color is your dress?

65
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,800
It's a champagne color
with pink and gold beads and it's corseted,

66
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,000
so it's a little sexy.

67
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,900
Oh, it sounds pretty.

68
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,100
If you want to talk about sexy,

69
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,700
you should see Lisa's dress
with that plunging neckline.

70
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,600
Ronnie's gonna love you in it.

71
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,600
Yeah, he's gonna love me
even more out of it.

72
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,700
I made sure Ronnie got
the biggest limousine he could find.

73
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,700
I can't actually believe
that Michael is helping spring for the limo

74
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
and a two bedroom suite
with Ronnie and Bobby.

75
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,000
It's prom night.
That boy's planning on getting laid.

76
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,900
Yeah. In his dreams maybe.

77
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,600
All right, Donna. Have a look.

78
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,700
Oh, it looks good. I like it.

79
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,600
- Donna?
- What?

80
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,965
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

81
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,600
What time did Bobby say
to be ready for the limo?

82
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,900
- 7:00.
- Oh, I'm so excited.

83
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,500
- He's going to be here soon, Donna!
- Okay, Aunt Karen!

84
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,800
She's come so far.

85
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,500
Going to her senior prom.

86
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

87
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,100
Oh, my God. Oh, my gosh. I'm sorry.

88
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,065
Sorry.

89
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,000
No, no, it's okay.

90
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,800
Have you stopped taking your pills?

91
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,200
Yeah, for like a week now.

92
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,200
You know what Dr. Crowe said.

93
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,900
I know, I just...

94
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,565
I don't want to be numb tonight.

95
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,000
I wanna remember everything.
Everything that happens.

96
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,900
Besides, you know, it's my prom.
I'm supposed to be really anxious, right?

97
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,700
Of course you are.

98
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,600
Gosh, you look so beautiful.

99
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,765
Thanks.

100
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,700
You are gonna have so much fun.
This is gonna be a great night.

101
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,100
Oh, my God! He's here.

102
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,100
Don't worry.

103
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,500
Here.

104
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,300
I know she would want you
to wear it tonight.

105
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,800
No, no. What if I get something on it?

106
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,700
She would be so proud of you.

107
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,000
Come here.

108
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,400
Thank you.

109
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,800
I'm gonna go downstairs
and tell Bobby that you're almost ready.

110
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,000
Okay.

111
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,100
Thanks.

112
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,000
I wouldn't be getting a scholarship
or anything, not my first year.

113
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,000
But I think if I work really, really hard...

114
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,800
You look beautiful.

115
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,400
Thanks.

116
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,900
You look so good. You clean up very well.

117
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,700
Thank you.

118
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,700
It's so pretty.

119
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,200
Yeah. Four hours with the flower lady.

120
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,000
- Did you pick it out yourself?
- Kind of.

121
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,565
Did not!

122
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,500
Okay, yeah. Thank you.

123
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,200
- Thank you.
- Here, I can do this.

124
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,400
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
- Oh, my God!

125
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,300
You totally scared me.

126
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,900
- Perfect.
- Photo op.

127
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,300
Okay, ready?

128
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,200
- So cheesy.
- Okay. One, two, three, four, five.

129
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,900
There we go.

130
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,700
We're trusting you.

131
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,400
- I went to prom once...
- Honey, honey. It's okay.

132
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,700
I know, sir.
You have nothing to worry about.

133
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,900
You're the most beautiful girl in the world.

134
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,500
- Thanks, Uncle Jack.
- Come here.

135
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,500
- I love you guys.
- Have a great time, all right?

136
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,500
- Thank you.
- Good night.

137
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,300
I cannot wait to get there.

138
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,400
You look awesome!

139
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Let's get to the goddamn prom.

140
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,500
You guys look so pretty!

141
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,700
Well, not the guys,
the guys look very handsome.

142
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,900
Wait, now guys get in.

143
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,100
You know Crissy is going
all Hollywood with her theme this year

144
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,200
since she's the president
of the prom committee.

145
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:50,700
I heard that she spent $100,000 over budget
and her dad had to write a check.

146
00:13:50,735 --> 00:13:52,800
- Stop it!
- He's totally pissed!

147
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,900
I wish that was my daddy.

148
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,200
Rich bitch, one word.

149
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,100
- Oh, hyphen.
- $100,000?

150
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,600
Come on, more pictures! Pictures!

151
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,800
Next?

152
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,000
Great. Perfect.

153
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,400
- Hey, Winn.
- Yeah, that's Detective Winn to you, kid.

154
00:14:45,435 --> 00:14:47,500
This just came in for you.

155
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,100
What?

156
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,100
<i>- Biller here.</i>
- This is Detective Winn from Bridgeport PD.

157
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,100
I'm calling about a fax
concerning the escape of Richard Fenton.

158
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,000
What the hell is going on?

159
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,100
<i>We just received word from the hospital
of Fenton's escape on Wednesday evening.</i>

160
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,300
Why'd it take three goddamn days
to notify us?

161
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,400
<i>Sorry, sir.
I needed to notify the court.</i>

162
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,800
- Damn it, I don't believe this.
- What is it?

163
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,400
This is a case I had three years ago.
Hey, Jones, get me a car?

164
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,700
Come on.

165
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,600
High school teacher, he got crazy obsessed
with a young female student.

166
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,265
They fired him. That didn't stop it.

167
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,200
Then the family got a restraining order
against him and he went psycho.

168
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,300
She got home from the movies,
he didn't know she was there.

169
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,300
She hid under the bed
and had to watch him kill her mother.

170
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,600
Oh, my God.

171
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,700
We arrested that son-of-a-bitch
at his house.

172
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,000
<i>We found journals of this guy
having fantasies about this girl.</i>

173
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,900
<i>He had pictures of her everywhere.</i>

174
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,600
That was pretty hard for her, too,
she had to ID him.

175
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,300
<i>You got something to say, Mr. Fenton?</i>

176
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,400
Nothing can keep us apart.

177
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,700
- That's him.
<i>- She needs me now more than ever.</i>

178
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,300
She has no family.

179
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,900
- I see what you're trying to do.
- All she has is me.

180
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,700
- Hey, listen to me.
- You know we love one another?

181
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,000
- Ask Donna.
- Can we go now, please?

182
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,100
Are we almost done here?

183
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,600
Donna makes me feel,
and when I touch her...

184
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,400
That's enough!
Don't look over there, look at me!

185
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,200
- Can we go now, please?
<i>- We'll be together forever.</i>

186
00:16:20,235 --> 00:16:21,765
You're gonna be in jail!

187
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,500
We'll be together forever.
That's my promise.

188
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,800
That's enough. We're going.

189
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,300
All right, you're going to jail.

190
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,400
<i>I'll see you soon, Donna.</i>

191
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,000
<i>We matched DNA,
his prints were everywhere,</i>

192
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,400
<i>so her IDing him sealed the deal.</i>

193
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,000
As far as we were concerned,
he was going to die. Definitely.

194
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,500
The jury didn't think so.
No, they came back with insanity.

195
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,800
He's been in a maximum security prison
for the criminally insane

196
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,900
<i>up until three days ago.</i>

197
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,400
What happened to the girl?

198
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,400
Well, she's got an aunt and uncle
that live here. They took her in.

199
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,300
After the trial,
things settled down a little bit,

200
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,600
- until she started getting the letters.
- Letters?

201
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,400
Yeah, and some sick shit, too.
Hang tight, kid.

202
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,900
I'm gonna go tell the aunt and uncle.
This is gonna rock their world.

203
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,100
- Oh, we're turning in! We're here!
- Are we here? Yeah!

204
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,400
Holy crap!

205
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,500
We're here!

206
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,900
Talk about Hollywood.

207
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,300
You look lovely.

208
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,000
Nice try, Mr. Nichols. Bad boy.

209
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,300
Oh, God!

210
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,600
<i>May I help you, sir?</i>

211
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,700
Donna Keppel, you look incredible.

212
00:18:34,735 --> 00:18:36,500
And Claire, you, too.

213
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,200
And Lisa, wow!

214
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
That dress, it's so...

215
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,600
Inappropriate?

216
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,900
Crissy! Wow, your dress...

217
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,800
It's so simple.

218
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,100
It's so you.

219
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,500
Girls.

220
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,700
Gentlemen?

221
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,665
Crissy, come on, this is prom.

222
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,600
Okay, let's just all be nice,
and just forget about the past.

223
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,000
As fellow prom queen nominee,
I want to wish you luck tonight.

224
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,500
You're gonna need all you can get.

225
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,500
Oh, you think you got it all wrapped up,
do you?

226
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,900
Well, they're certainly not propped up
and on parade like yours are,

227
00:19:17,935 --> 00:19:19,500
that's for sure.

228
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,800
- You know what, I'm so sick...
- Baby, baby, she's not even worth it.

229
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:27,400
Look, you're gonna be queen,
I'm gonna be your king, all right?

230
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,100
Look, I'm gonna go get the keys right quick.
I'll be back.

231
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,600
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

232
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,800
Lisa, you really do look beautiful.
I just know you're gonna win.

233
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,400
Well, thanks, Ms. Waters.

234
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,500
- Have fun.
- Bye.

235
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,600
I know who she voted for.

236
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,300
- She is so in love with you.
- Shut up.

237
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,100
<i>Bridgeport High, huh?</i>

238
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,300
<i>Come on, now. What's up, everybody,
and welcome to the prom of all proms!</i>

239
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,500
- Oh, my God! Look at this place!
- Hey, look at me on the big screen.

240
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,600
<i>Bridgeport High, make some noise!</i>

241
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,600
<i>Yeah!</i>

242
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,900
<i>My name is DJ Tyler.
I'm gonna be hosting the events tonight.</i>

243
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,400
<i>This has to be
the greatest prom on Earth.</i>

244
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,700
<i>Brought to you also by Crissy Lynn.
I see you over there, girl. Yeah!</i>

245
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:18,600
<i>Congratulations, Bridgeport High,
to all 206 of you graduates.</i>

246
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,400
<i>It's time to get the party started!
Get out there and get your party pumping!</i>

247
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,800
<i>Now, it's time for
a little Consequence.</i>

248
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,200
I mean, you gotta hand it to Crissy, though.
This is amazing!

249
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,700
Wait, does this mean
we can't make fun of her anymore?

250
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,100
Nah!

251
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,865
And just so you know,
our fitness center will be closed

252
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,000
because of the renovations being done
on the mezzanine level.

253
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:02,365
Thank you, Mr. Ramsey.
If I can just get your autograph.

254
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,400
Can I get three keys to suite 312?
I have it reserved under Ronnie Heflin.

255
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,900
One moment.

256
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,500
All right. There you are, Mr. Heflin.

257
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,900
Thank you.

258
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,200
Do you have a preference
as to which floor, Mr. Ramsey?

259
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,400
Third floor would be great.

260
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,300
You really outdid yourself, Crissy.
I mean, we really appreciate it.

261
00:21:27,335 --> 00:21:30,600
Thanks. I wanted it to look
just like an L.A. club.

262
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,500
I mean, nobody can believe it, right?

263
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,000
- One for you.
- Thank you.

264
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,600
One for you.

265
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,900
- And one for...
- We're going up to the room to freshen up.

266
00:21:47,935 --> 00:21:49,500
Why, baby? You look great.

267
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,400
That's correct!
You're doing very well tonight.

268
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,300
But I'll look even better when I get back.

269
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,600
Well, let's go get a table,
before they're all gone.

270
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,100
Oh, hold that door.

271
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,100
Thank you.

272
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,300
Oh, man.

273
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,100
So...

274
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,800
Which one of you beautiful young women
is my date tonight?

275
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,600
So, we're gonna take this party upstairs,
ladies. Room 604.

276
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,400
Yeah, we'll... Be right up.

277
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,900
Lisa!

278
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,400
- 604.
- Right. Got it.

279
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,765
Come on.

280
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,700
- I'm gonna hold you to that.
- Sixth floor.

281
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,000
Excuse me. What's his problem?

282
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,200
Oh, my God.

283
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,800
The one on the end looked like my dad.
I swear.

284
00:22:53,835 --> 00:22:55,300
Kind of, yeah!

285
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,600
That one guy was kind of cute.

286
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,700
- No!
- No!

287
00:23:02,735 --> 00:23:04,400
Oh, my God!

288
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,300
Oh, my God, you guys!

289
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,700
Come here, come here, come here!

290
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,500
Excuse me?

291
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,700
My card, it doesn't seem to work.
Can you help?

292
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,900
Here's your problem, it's got a scratch.

293
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:01,100
Call the front desk, and someone
will bring you a replacement card.

294
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,900
Thank you very much.

295
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,100
One more thing.

296
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,000
Can I have some extra towels?

297
00:24:09,035 --> 00:24:10,200
Sure.

298
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,400
Jack?

299
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,700
Detective Winn.

300
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,200
- Is she here?
- No, no, she's not.

301
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,800
- She's at her senior prom, why?
- Jack, I gotta talk to you.

302
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,300
Come outside.

303
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,165
What's going on?

304
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,300
Jack, it's Richard Fenton.
He escaped from jail three days ago.

305
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,565
He's at large.

306
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,600
How could it take so long
for us to be notified?

307
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,300
Jack, I think we should bring Donna home,
just to be safe.

308
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,900
I can't take a chance. I gotta put
a unit on your house, you know that.

309
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,400
All right?
And I'm gonna put backup on the hotel.

310
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,100
No.

311
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,900
Thank you.

312
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,300
For what?

313
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,100
For tonight.

314
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,900
For everything.

315
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,100
Well, you're welcome.

316
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,800
I am pretty awesome.

317
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,500
- At prom, you're gonna talk about this?
- I don't understand...

318
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,500
Hey, what's going on
with Claire and Michael?

319
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,200
Oh, same ol', same ol'.

320
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
He's freaking out because
she's going away to college. You know.

321
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,100
Babe, they'll be fine.

322
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,700
- I gotta talk to you.
- Okay. I'll be right back.

323
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:39,000
- What's going on?
- Michael. He's making me so damn mad.

324
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,900
And on top of that, I have killer cramps.

325
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,300
Don't let a stupid argument
ruin your prom night, okay?

326
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,100
And I have Midol up in my purse.
I'll go get it for you.

327
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,600
Thank you.

328
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,465
Is everything okay?

329
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,300
Yeah, I need the key to the suite.
I gotta go get something for Claire.

330
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,400
- I'll just go with you.
- Oh, no, no. It's okay.

331
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,300
Thank you.

332
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,600
Patrol car just pulled up.

333
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:21,400
I don't understand how you could not bring
her home with that maniac on the loose.

334
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,500
And Detective Winn, he said he wanted
to bring her home, you said that...

335
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,300
I know, I know, I know.

336
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,800
But he also said that there's no reason
to believe that Fenton's headed this way.

337
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:36,000
And, honey, if we show up at her prom,
in front of all her friends,

338
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:42,500
what's that gonna do to all the progress
that she's made over the past three years?

339
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,900
Do you remember how many nights
she woke up screaming?

340
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,400
I just don't ever want that little girl
to go through that again, do you?

341
00:28:50,435 --> 00:28:52,300
No, of course I don't.

342
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,100
- But I'm so scared.
- I know, I know.

343
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,700
Hello?

344
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,600
Is anybody here?

345
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,200
Claire?

346
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,600
Bobby?

347
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,200
Is that you?

348
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,800
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry.

349
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,300
You scared the hell out of me!

350
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,100
Are you okay?

351
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,300
No.

352
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,565
What happened?

353
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,700
Michael thinks I'm going away to school
just so I can date other guys.

354
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:14,200
He just went ballistic because
he saw me talking to Rick. He's impossible.

355
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,400
I'm sorry.
Here, take these, it'll make you feel better.

356
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,000
Thanks.

357
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,700
Do you want me to hang out with you,
until you want to go back downstairs?

358
00:31:25,735 --> 00:31:29,800
No. I'm just gonna fix my face,
then I'll come back down. Thanks.

359
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,800
How are you doing?

360
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,400
I'm good.

361
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,600
- You look beautiful.
- You look beautiful.

362
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,400
Okay, I'll go request some J.T.,
we'll dance, we'll have fun.

363
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,300
See you down there.

364
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,800
Donna?

365
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,300
Michael?

366
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,000
Michael? What are you doing?

367
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,700
Mr. Fenton?

368
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,965
- Nash.
- I'm at Pacific Grand.

369
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,400
Our girl's got the senior prom tonight.

370
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,800
I want you to get Hicks, Stryker, Ansen,
and Grant, get them in plain clothes,

371
00:33:52,835 --> 00:33:54,100
<i>get them over here ASAP.</i>

372
00:33:54,135 --> 00:33:55,900
Why, is something wrong?

373
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,100
<i>No, and that's exactly
how I want to keep it.</i>

374
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,300
By some chance this bastard decides
to come here, we're gonna be ready for him.

375
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,800
You got it.

376
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,600
Hey. Detective Winn, Bridgeport PD.
How are you?

377
00:34:11,635 --> 00:34:13,400
Doing fine, thanks.

378
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,200
Have you seen this man tonight?

379
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,800
No. Who is this guy, anyway?

380
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,500
Oh, he's just someone I'm looking for.

381
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,100
He dangerous?

382
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,700
Do me a favor, why don't you make
copies of that, give it to your staff.

383
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,600
- Let me know if anyone sees him.
- Will do.

384
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,900
You got exits here.
How many exits you got?

385
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:42,100
- Two outside fire stairwells.
- Let me see that. Yep.

386
00:34:42,135 --> 00:34:44,500
There's the loading dock in the back.

387
00:34:44,535 --> 00:34:46,600
Stairwell from the basement.

388
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:51,400
Three fire exits lit up on the ground floor,
in the main entrance.

389
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,900
- Can I keep this?
- It's all yours.

390
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,400
Okay, great. Thank you very much.

391
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,500
Should I be concerned?

392
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,700
No.

393
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,400
<i>All right, folks.
You looking real good out there tonight.</i>

394
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,000
<i>But what I'm gonna do is,
I'm gonna slow it down just a little bit,</i>

395
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,200
<i>because I don't want you
to sweat out your good clothes.</i>

396
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,100
<i>On your way to the dance floor, though,
fellas, grab your girl</i>

397
00:35:22,135 --> 00:35:23,700
<i>and thank your man Ronnie out there.</i>

398
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,600
<i>Ronnie Heflin is sending this song
out to his girl, Lisa Hines.</i>

399
00:35:27,635 --> 00:35:31,200
<i>So, we gonna get that busy right now.
Here you go, folks.</i>

400
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,400
You wanna dance?

401
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,400
What's going on?

402
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,800
I'm thinking about going to State
with you next year.

403
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Why?

404
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,900
I don't know.

405
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:20,100
I guess I just don't think I'm ready
to be so far away from home.

406
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:25,100
If we were at State together,
then we'd get to see each other all the time.

407
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,400
I mean, if you wanted to.

408
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,600
No, I would love that.

409
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,500
I mean, I would. I mean, you know I would.
It would be amazing.

410
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,800
But?

411
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,100
But nothing, Donna.

412
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,300
You got into Brown with a full scholarship.

413
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,400
I mean, you don't just throw that away
for anything, or anybody.

414
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,900
It's not that I don't want
to be near you next year.

415
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,000
It's just that...

416
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
That would be really selfish of me.

417
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,500
And I'd always know in the back of my head
that I was the reason

418
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:02,900
that you didn't get a big-time
Ivy League shot at the world, you know?

419
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,500
But what if this long distance thing
doesn't work out?

420
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,165
I mean, look what's happening
with Michael and Claire.

421
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,900
And Claire's gonna be only a two hour drive
away from him next year.

422
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,500
Claire and Michael are not you and me.

423
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,400
Not even close.

424
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,400
Right?

425
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,300
What is it?

426
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,000
I'm scared.

427
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,300
It just feels like

428
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,900
everything's falling apart.

429
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,900
And I'm scared of losing you.

430
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,300
I'm scared that somebody else
is gonna come along

431
00:37:37,335 --> 00:37:39,900
and find out how amazing you are.

432
00:37:39,935 --> 00:37:42,100
If this is real, it'll last.

433
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:48,300
I think we've been through some
pretty rough times already, don't you think?

434
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:53,000
- Yeah.
- Donna, you gotta stop being scared, okay?

435
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,700
Because there's nothing
left to be scared of.

436
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,500
I promise.

437
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,000
Hey, you guys seen Claire lately?

438
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,300
Yeah. She's up in the suite.

439
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,965
What the hell is she doing up there?

440
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,500
You pissed her off, Michael.
She's been crying her eyes out.

441
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:15,100
You can't keep doing this to her.
You're gonna lose her.

442
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,100
Yeah, I doubt that.

443
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Claire and Michael, exhibit A.
Nothing like us.

444
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,300
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

445
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,100
Claire?

446
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,100
Claire?

447
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,800
Are you here?

448
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,900
Are you in there?

449
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:30,100
Come on, babe.
Look, I don't want to fight anymore, okay?

450
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:35,200
Honestly, I promise. I'm gonna stop
bugging you about going away and all.

451
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,300
I'm just gonna deal with it, okay?
I swear to God.

452
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,000
Claire, please, don't do this.

453
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,200
All right. Fine.

454
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,900
I'm just gonna sit out here.
I'm just gonna wait for you to come out.

455
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,900
I don't care how long it takes.
I got all damn night.

456
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,800
All right.

457
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,400
Claire,

458
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,800
what do you want me to say?

459
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,900
You want me to say that I'm sorry?

460
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,500
Okay. Okay, I'm sorry.

461
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,000
Claire, look, I really am sorry, Claire.

462
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,700
Look, don't let my being an idiot
ruin our prom, okay?

463
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,600
Okay? Claire?

464
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,400
All right, where'd you go?

465
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,000
Claire?

466
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,700
Gotcha!

467
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,800
But I already said I was sorry.
What else do you want me to say, huh?

468
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,700
This is getting silly. Enough already.

469
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,600
Claire?

470
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,100
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

471
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,700
<i>I did not know you partied like that
here at Bridgeport!</i>

472
00:42:37,735 --> 00:42:40,200
<i>Man, you done wore me out up here!</i>

473
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,600
<i>I tell you what though, I'm gonna take me
a little 15-minute break.</i>

474
00:42:43,635 --> 00:42:44,900
<i>But while I'm gone,</i>

475
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,600
<i>the AV department put together
a nice little yearbook for you, so enjoy that.</i>

476
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:53,200
<i>And when I come back, this year's
prom king and prom queen, all right?</i>

477
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,000
<i>See you in a minute.</i>

478
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,900
Hey, let's go upstairs.

479
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,500
They're gonna announce king and queen.

480
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,500
DJ's taking a break, and then he's gonna
come back and play a couple other songs.

481
00:43:15,535 --> 00:43:17,900
You don't care about this at all, do you?

482
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,800
What's to care about?

483
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,900
What if Ronnie wins king instead of you?

484
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,200
What if he does?

485
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:29,200
He's her boyfriend.
I have to be crowned with her boyfriend?

486
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,800
Look, Ronnie's the starting quarterback.
All-city two years in a row.

487
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,600
Yeah, Crissy, you could do a lot worse.

488
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,600
Besides, maybe you won't even win.

489
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:48,600
All right, look, I'm gonna go upstairs,
just call me when it's time, okay?

490
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,800
If he were any dumber I'd have to water him.

491
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,600
I wanna make a toast

492
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,900
to my little queen.

493
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,700
No matter what happens.

494
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,000
Cheers.

495
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,100
If that bitch wins, I swear

496
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,300
I'll hurl.

497
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:24,000
Okay, I'm sorry, but just explain to me
why do you care so much?

498
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,300
Because what do you get?

499
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,300
You get like a bouquet of roses and
a tacky tiara you can only wear at proms.

500
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,400
It's not about what you get.
It's, like, about the honor, you know?

501
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,300
It's about the respect of my peers.

502
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,300
- What?
- Your peers?

503
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,200
- That's the geekiest thing you've ever said.
- Okay, I guess it was a little geeky.

504
00:44:46,235 --> 00:44:50,600
But seriously, I just want Crissy to know
that she can't buy everything.

505
00:44:50,635 --> 00:44:53,200
And think about the reunions to come.

506
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:57,400
If I win, it'll eat away at her
till the day she dies.

507
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,065
That's awful.

508
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:02,200
You're so sexy
when you're mean and vindictive.

509
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,400
All right.

510
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,300
How's it going?

511
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,300
Yeah, well, so far so good.
Anything your end?

512
00:45:16,335 --> 00:45:17,400
No.

513
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,665
Which one is she?

514
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,400
She's the blonde, at the back table.

515
00:45:22,435 --> 00:45:23,500
She's pretty.

516
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,100
And alive. And I want her to stay that way.

517
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,900
Guys.

518
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,500
This is it.

519
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,900
This is all ending, this time of our lives.

520
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,600
You know, everyone always says that
prom is supposed to be this amazing time

521
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:51,900
that everyone looks forward to
since the beginning of freshman year.

522
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,200
But no one ever tells you

523
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,800
it's really sad, you know?

524
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,200
Because some of us are never
gonna see each other again.

525
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,200
- Except for us!
- Oh, thank you.

526
00:46:03,235 --> 00:46:05,100
We'll see each other all the time.

527
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,200
Well, I don't know about any of them, but...

528
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,600
I'm sure gonna miss you guys.

529
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:15,400
Ronnie, I'm gonna be 100 miles away.
I'm not going too far.

530
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,900
And I'll be home on the holidays.

531
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,800
And Claire's only gonna be two hours away.

532
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,500
- Where is Claire?
- Oh, yeah.

533
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,900
- Where's Michael?
- Maybe they're still in the suite.

534
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,300
Where we should be.

535
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,000
All right, stop.

536
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,500
You know what,
we're gonna give you guys some space.

537
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,600
- Yeah, we'll be right back.
- I think that's a good idea.

538
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:39,600
Come on, Maria. Where are you? Maria?

539
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,700
<i>Are you there?</i>

540
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,900
<i>Hello?</i>

541
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,400
Hey, Simms, come here.

542
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,465
Have you seen Maria?
412 needs a turn down

543
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,500
and I'm trying to get her on her walkie,
but she doesn't answer.

544
00:46:54,535 --> 00:46:57,500
I've got this for 304.
I'll check and see if she's there.

545
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:59,200
All right, thanks.

546
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:03,200
- Great, thanks.
- Thank you.

547
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,900
Evening, sir.

548
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,300
Maria?

549
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,400
Excuse me, sir?

550
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,300
Yes.

551
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,500
Did you happen to see
the housekeeper up here?

552
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,600
She's right here in my room.

553
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,600
Turning down the bed.

554
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,500
Thank you.

555
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,600
Maria?

556
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:23,000
Hey, yo, Bobby,
let me talk to you for a sec.

557
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,700
Me and Lisa are gonna head up to the suite,

558
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,900
see what's taking
Michael and Claire so long. All right?

559
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,600
Right. Just make it quick, all right?

560
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,400
Five minutes, max.

561
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,000
Is that all?

562
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:34,500
Very funny.

563
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:38,100
If you do see Michael and Claire,
tell them to get their butts down here.

564
00:48:38,135 --> 00:48:39,600
Will do. Bye.

565
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,800
Where are they going?

566
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Upstairs to the suite
for a little alone time.

567
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,400
I'm not sleeping in that bed.

568
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,400
- I'm having a great time.
- Me, too.

569
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,600
I'm sorry.

570
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,200
Gotcha.

571
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,600
Look, come on, baby.

572
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,500
- Lisa?
- Yeah.

573
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,900
That guy, he looks so familiar.

574
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,400
His eyes.

575
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,600
Baby, your eyes are so...

576
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,500
- Where is it?
- The very back of the hotel's parking lot.

577
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,300
Come on, we ain't got a lot of time.

578
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,300
I swear that I know
that guy from somewhere.

579
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,400
Look, know him or want to get to know him?

580
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,100
Don't be stupid.

581
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,900
Did you see how he looked at me?
I mean, his eyes were so...

582
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,900
God, I swear I've seen him
some place before.

583
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,600
Why don't you stop
thinking about him, right?

584
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,700
Think about me, okay?

585
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:05,400
<i>There you go, Bridgeport.
That's how you do a prom, everybody.</i>

586
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:09,100
<i>You need to come to the parking lot.
I think we got something.</i>

587
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,100
<i>All right, I'm gonna have to ask you
to move on out the way.</i>

588
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,200
<i>Clear the dance floor, because
this is the end of my time right now.</i>

589
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,300
<i>It's time for me
to bring to the stage,</i>

590
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,900
<i>the prettiest P.E. teacher
I've ever met in my whole life.</i>

591
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,400
<i>Ms. Waters, everybody,
because she's about to announce</i>

592
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:29,400
<i>this year's prom king and prom queen.
Here we go!</i>

593
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,865
<i>Okay. Oh, sorry, sorry.</i>

594
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:36,500
<i>Let's give it up for DJ Tyler
for giving us an awesome prom.</i>

595
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:42,500
<i>All righty.
Now, I have in my hot little hand here</i>

596
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,700
<i>Bridgeport High School's
prom king and prom queen.</i>

597
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,300
<i>Will the nominees please
join me here up on stage?</i>

598
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:53,700
<i>For prom queen I have,
Crissy Lynn, Lisa Hines...</i>

599
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,400
- They gotta get down here.
- I know, I know.

600
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,500
<i>... Michelle Evaretti,
and Katie Higgins.</i>

601
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,300
<i>Come on up, girls!</i>

602
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:05,100
<i>- What's goin' on? You've reached Ronnie.
- Straight to voicemail.</i>

603
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,300
Try him on the house phone.

604
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,300
<i>All righty, and prom king is
Rick Leland,</i>

605
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,000
<i>Ronnie Heflin, Michael Kelley,
and Dennis Long.</i>

606
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,600
A woman over in Woodburn
filed a missing persons on her husband.

607
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:25,400
She said that he would take the train
to work every day in Portland,

608
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,800
but he would always
leave his car at the station.

609
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,700
But he didn't come home last night.

610
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:32,900
Open it up.

611
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,065
No wallet, no ID, no credit card, no money.

612
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:43,400
And the car was registered to
a Howard K. Ramsey, our missing person.

613
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,600
<i>What about these decorations, everybody?
The prom committee, sensational job.</i>

614
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,600
You're so beautiful.

615
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:11,400
Jesus Christ!

616
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:14,000
- Of course! It's him, it's him!
- Look, enough already.

617
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:17,100
No, I gotta get to Donna!

618
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,500
I don't believe this.

619
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,800
Come on!

620
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,300
Damn it!

621
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
- Why the rush?
- Oh, God!

622
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:03,900
It must be off the hook.
They're not answering the room either.

623
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,700
Well, you better go up and try to find them.
I'm sorry. Be fast!

624
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,700
Oh, my God!

625
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,000
Lisa?

626
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,300
Lisa?

627
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:50,100
<i>- Ronnie Heflin, Lisa Hines.
- Oh, here's Ronnie! Here's Ronnie.</i>

628
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,500
Hey, where's Lisa?

629
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,400
I don't know. She said she came down
here to tell you that...

630
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:56,100
Oh, maybe she's in the bathroom.
Okay, you get up on stage. Go, go.

631
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,900
<i>- Ronnie, please.
- Sorry. I'm right here.</i>

632
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:02,200
Give me the key to the suite.
I'm gonna go try to find her in the bathroom.

633
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:03,600
If she's not there, I'll go check upstairs.

634
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:08,800
Where the hell is she?

635
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,700
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

636
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,000
<i>Has anyone seen Lisa Hines?</i>

637
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:58,100
Excuse me, sir. Howard K. Ramsey,
is he registered here? Ramsey.

638
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:02,100
Yes, sir. Room 309.

639
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,500
Okay, here's what we're doing.
You stay here by the front door.

640
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,500
You tell the guys at the exits
what's happening,

641
00:58:07,535 --> 00:58:09,400
- and get me some backup, okay?
- You got it.

642
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,500
Give me a room key to room 309.

643
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:26,300
Mr. Ramsey.

644
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,900
Ah, damn it.

645
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:20,500
No. No, he's here. He's killed a maid.

646
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:23,600
<i>Cover all the doors.
I'm gonna pull the alarm.</i>

647
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:27,100
I want the entire place cleared immediately!
We'll flush him out.

648
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,900
Find Donna Keppel and put her
in protective custody now! Nash, now!

649
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
All right. You got it.
Stryker, watch the door.

650
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,800
<i>All right, we're gonna
have to start without her.</i>

651
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:44,100
<i>Bridgeport High's
prom king and prom queen are...</i>

652
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:52,800
<i>Alert! Please exit the building.
This is an emergency.</i>

653
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:58,100
<i>- Please stay calm. Quiet, please.
- Everyone, please, quiet down!</i>

654
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:01,950
I'm Detective Nash
with the Bridgeport Police Department.

655
01:00:01,985 --> 01:00:05,600
I am going to need you
to exit the hotel through the lobby.

656
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:10,700
Now, there's no reason to panic.
The Fire Department will be here shortly.

657
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:13,300
They were just about to
crown king and queen!

658
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,500
People! I'm not kidding, here!
Please, let's move, now!

659
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,100
This will have to wait, all right?

660
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,000
- The hell it will!
- Crissy!

661
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:27,500
Shit!

662
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,300
Oh, my God! You have to be kidding me!

663
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:52,400
Lisa?

664
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,400
<i>Alert! Please exit the building.
This is an emergency.</i>

665
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,300
Keep it moving, people.

666
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:10,500
Crissy, what's going on?
Where's everyone going?

667
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:14,900
- Hey, Rick? What's going on?
- I don't know, but we gotta go outside.

668
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,600
I forgot my mom's shawl upstairs.

669
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:21,800
If you see Bobby can you tell him
I'll meet him outside?

670
01:01:21,835 --> 01:01:22,900
Thanks.

671
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,400
<i>Alert! Please exit the building.
This is an emergency.</i>

672
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,500
<i>If there is a Donna Keppel here,</i>

673
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,800
<i>will you please come
to the front of the stage?</i>

674
01:01:40,835 --> 01:01:44,000
Excuse me. Why are you looking for Donna?

675
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:45,500
Why? Do you know where she is?

676
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,400
- She went looking for my girl.
- Where?

677
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,100
Women's restroom
and then up to the third floor.

678
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,100
Why?

679
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,000
Hey, what's the problem?

680
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:58,300
<i>Your attention, please.
Keep this area clear for emergency vehicles.</i>

681
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,600
<i>Stay on the sidewalk.</i>

682
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:18,300
<i>Alert! Please exit the building.
This is an emergency.</i>

683
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,800
Lisa?

684
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:30,900
Claire?

685
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:35,800
Hello?

686
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,600
Oh, I've missed you.

687
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:30,100
There isn't a moment where
I haven't thought about you, Donna.

688
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:32,100
Please, don't do this.

689
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,200
Don't be afraid.

690
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:37,900
Donna!

691
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,400
Get out!

692
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:41,700
No!

693
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:44,500
No!

694
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,100
Donna, open up.

695
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:09,800
Open up!

696
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:11,500
Donna!

697
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,200
No!

698
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:18,600
No!

699
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:28,000
Leave me alone!

700
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:40,700
Ansen, Grant, I need these people back!
Push them 50 yards back!

701
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,800
Get them back here, put it right there.
Come on! Let's go!

702
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:44,900
You gotta be all the way back
to the sidewalk, all right?

703
01:05:44,935 --> 01:05:46,700
- Winn.
- Where is she?

704
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,300
I don't know. They got separated.

705
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,800
- He said she went to go look for her friend.
- What the hell is going on?

706
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:52,500
Why won't anybody
tell me why you're looking for Donna?

707
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,600
Hey, man. She went back up
to your suite to get something.

708
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:58,500
Move, move, move!

709
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:01,100
She told me to tell you just to wait here.
She'd come back down.

710
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,400
You couldn't tell me sooner, Rick?

711
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:05,100
Did you see Lisa?

712
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:06,700
No.

713
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,200
Donna?

714
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:50,700
Donna, stop!

715
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:58,400
He's in there, he's in there,
he's in there, he's in there!

716
01:06:58,435 --> 01:07:00,300
Claire's under the bed and she's dead!
She's dead!

717
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,700
- Get her out of here, Nash.
- You have to help me, please.

718
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,900
Hey! Donna! Donna!

719
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,800
Bobby. Bobby. Oh, my God! Bobby!

720
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:50,200
- Yeah, come on. Here. You okay?
- Donna, get in the car. Please.

721
01:08:50,235 --> 01:08:52,600
- I'm going with her.
- Okay, get in the car.

722
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:54,365
Can he come with me?

723
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:57,600
- Don't leave me. Don't leave me.
- I won't. I'm coming, I'm coming, baby.

724
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,800
- Look, what's happening?
- Hold on.

725
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:01,900
I talked to your aunt and uncle.
They know what's going on, okay?

726
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,100
- I'm gonna take you home, all right?
- Look, did you see Lisa?

727
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:05,500
Claire's dead.

728
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:09,800
What'd you say?

729
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:12,200
Bobby! Wait!

730
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:13,700
Wait!

731
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,400
Clear a lane here, please!

732
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:20,100
Yeah.

733
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:23,500
He's somewhere in this hotel,
because all the exit points are covered.

734
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:24,865
We're gonna tear this place apart,

735
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:27,000
room by room, floor by floor,
until we get him.

736
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:28,100
How's the girl doing?

737
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:30,565
Yeah, she's safe.
And her boyfriend's with us, too.

738
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,800
Keep that house completely covered
until I find this guy.

739
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:34,600
<i>Yeah, no problem.</i>

740
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:42,200
My girlfriend is missing, and I need to know
what the hell is going on!

741
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:45,800
I'm sure she's out here somewhere,
all right? Just take a look for her.

742
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,100
Okay, let's go!

743
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,365
We'll find her.

744
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:59,500
Here it is. We have three dead.
One maid, two kids, okay?

745
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:03,200
We've had all the exits covered all night,
so there's no way he got out.

746
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:06,600
I want to start on the ground floor,
and work our way up.

747
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:10,600
The hotel already knows what's going on,
so let's get to work. Come on, let's go!

748
01:10:10,635 --> 01:10:14,500
Hey, Hicks, do me a favor,
get all those people to go home. Everybody.

749
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:16,200
Consider it done.

750
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:20,400
Hey, is everybody out?

751
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:22,400
- Yes, sir.
- I think so.

752
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:26,000
Lisa?

753
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,600
Donna!

754
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:41,400
Oh, my God! Oh, thank God you're safe!

755
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,800
- It's all happening again.
- It's okay.

756
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:46,165
- Bobby, you okay?
- Yes, sir, I am.

757
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,500
I called my parents
and I told them what was happening.

758
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:51,200
- I'd like to stay with Donna tonight.
- Absolutely, absolutely.

759
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:52,600
Come on inside.

760
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:54,100
Mr. Turner, please.

761
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:57,100
- I'm Detective Nash.
- Hey, how are you?

762
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:59,900
How many entrances are on the house?

763
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:03,000
There's the front and the back, what?

764
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:05,700
Tell me you've caught this animal.

765
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:17,600
- I can't find Lisa!
- We are looking for her.

766
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:20,600
I've got some missing students inside.
I want to know what you're doing about it.

767
01:11:20,635 --> 01:11:22,100
We are doing the best we can.
Please, be patient.

768
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:35,300
<i>Copy that.
We're finishing fourth floor, north exposure.</i>

769
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:39,900
Someone said that Claire was murdered,
and Michael and Lisa are missing.

770
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,900
- We all clear?
- We're all clear.

771
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,100
Let's close it up.

772
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,300
Over here.

773
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,400
Jesus.

774
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:14,000
<i>... faculty, staff, and guests,
to evacuate onto the streets.</i>

775
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:17,900
<i>The news conference, I'm sure,
will be forthcoming, and we will be here live</i>

776
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,365
<i>to give you the updates as they come in.
But to recap,</i>

777
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:25,400
<i>a night that was supposed to be
one of the greatest nights in a student's life</i>

778
01:12:25,435 --> 01:12:29,100
<i>may have ended tragically
in the historic Pacific Grand Hotel.</i>

779
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:31,600
What's going on, Detective?

780
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:33,800
This is an active crime scene investigation.

781
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:36,400
If we have any more information to share,
you will be the first to know.

782
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:37,965
Is it true that a student was murdered?

783
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,400
And that other students
at the prom are missing?

784
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:42,300
- Can you give us anything?
- Detective?

785
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:47,400
<i>The SWAT teams are engaged at the hotel.
Guests were evacuated and cleared.</i>

786
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:15,100
Look, we're just down the hall
if you need anything.

787
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,900
What are you doing?

788
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,400
Checking to see if there's
any news on what happened.

789
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,200
<i>Three students may have been
injured or killed in this historic hotel.</i>

790
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,000
They're dead.

791
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:40,965
They're dead, Bobby. They're dead.

792
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,300
- No, you still don't know that.
- Michael, Lisa and Claire, they're all dead.

793
01:13:45,335 --> 01:13:46,900
He killed them.

794
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:52,300
They're dead because
he was trying to get to me.

795
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:55,200
No, Donna. This is not your fault, okay?

796
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:58,000
This is not you, okay? This is him.

797
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:02,900
This is him, and they're gonna catch him,
okay? I promise.

798
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:05,200
How?

799
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,900
How can you promise me that?

800
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:15,000
I'm sorry.

801
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,700
Okay. Okay, come on.

802
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:25,300
Listen to me, I'm gonna be here, okay?

803
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,900
I'm gonna be here watching over you, okay?

804
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:50,400
Sorry, two, sir, is right here. Girl.

805
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:59,200
We got a positive ID from Ronnie Heflin.

806
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:03,500
His girlfriend was the female victim
we found up on the construction level.

807
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,065
- How's the kid doing?
- Not so good.

808
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:09,300
That's it. We turned the place upside down,
no sign of him anywhere.

809
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:13,500
What do you wanna do about the press?
They're getting kind of antsy.

810
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:15,800
I don't know.

811
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:19,400
I don't know.

812
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,300
What is that?

813
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,900
What the hell is that?

814
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:42,200
Get me a ladder. Get me a ladder!

815
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:43,400
Let's move this bed.

816
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,800
Come on, come on, put it right here.
Who's got a flashlight?

817
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:22,965
Jesus!

818
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,100
- Oh, my God.
- It's Simms!

819
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:29,200
- Hey, is everybody out?
- I think so.

820
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:34,600
Damn it. He walked right by me.
Move, move!

821
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:39,200
- Hey, has anybody talked to Nash?
- 10 minutes ago. Everything was cool.

822
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:58,500
- Nash.
- Hey, Fenton's out. He's not at the hotel.

823
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:01,200
Copy that. We're on it.

824
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,065
<i>What's the status with the family?</i>

825
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:07,000
They all went upstairs
about an hour and a half ago.

826
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:09,065
There's a light on in Donna's bedroom.

827
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:12,400
All right. I'm gonna call
and let them know what's happening.

828
01:17:12,435 --> 01:17:14,800
<i>- Copy?
- Yeah, you got it.</i>

829
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:26,000
<i>She's not supposed to be with somebody
else, she's supposed to be with me.</i>

830
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:28,600
<i>There was even the song on the radio.</i>

831
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:30,700
- Donna?
- Oh, my gosh!

832
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:31,900
You scared me.

833
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,900
- You okay?
- Yeah.

834
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:37,100
- I thought you were sleeping.
- No.

835
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,600
No, I was just resting my eyes.

836
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,100
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

837
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,600
<i>It's not like you hear the song Mandy
on the radio every day.</i>

838
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:48,700
<i>I haven't heard that song
in like ten years.</i>

839
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:47,200
What?

840
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:57,100
<i>The number you have reached is not
in service at this time. This is a recording.</i>

841
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,200
Were you sleeping?

842
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:01,900
No. I was just resting my eyes, okay?

843
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:06,500
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

844
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:14,400
<i>It's not like you hear the song Mandy
on the radio every day.</i>

845
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,900
<i>I haven't heard that song
in like ten years.</i>

846
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:36,700
<i>The number you have reached is not
in service at this time. This is a recording.</i>

847
01:19:36,735 --> 01:19:39,000
No, it can't be. It can't be.

848
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,300
I can't get through.
Something weird's going on with the phone.

849
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:03,965
Get in there and check it out!

850
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,500
<i>- Everything is secure, sir.
- Get in there and check it out right now!</i>

851
01:20:07,535 --> 01:20:09,700
<i>I'll be there in five minutes.</i>

852
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:41,200
Nash!
I told you to get up in there and call me!

853
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:44,500
Nash?

854
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,900
Thank you for staying.

855
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,300
Bobby?

856
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,400
Hey. Hey.

857
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:56,700
Donna?

858
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:06,200
Be quiet, or they'll find us.

859
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:24,700
Oh, my God!

860
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:32,800
One of your guys is down in the backyard.

861
01:23:32,835 --> 01:23:35,200
It's okay. It's okay.

862
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:40,300
Are you ready to go with me?

863
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:53,300
No!

864
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:07,900
Help!

865
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,065
Call me an ambulance.

866
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:11,400
I've got officers down,
I need backup, now, now!

867
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:12,500
Where is she?

868
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:15,650
- Let me go!
- Stop! Stop!

869
01:24:15,685 --> 01:24:18,500
- Get off me!
- Donna!

870
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:21,300
No!

871
01:24:57,800 --> 01:24:59,000
Bobby?

872
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,100
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

873
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:07,200
I'm sorry.

874
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:10,100
Come on, sweetheart. It's okay. It's okay.

875
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:15,900
It's over.

876
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:26,000
It's over, it's over. Okay?

877
