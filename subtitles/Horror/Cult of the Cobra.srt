James McCullen, you Scottish pig,

2
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:19,669
you've been found guilty of treason
for the sale of military arms

3
00:01:19,781 --> 00:01:22,978
to the enemies of our Lord,
King Louis Xlll,

4
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:26,053
even whilst you sold arms
to our Lord himself.

5
00:01:26,621 --> 00:01:31,923
Your king is a vile bag of filth
who murders his own allies.

6
00:01:33,027 --> 00:01:34,619
I should have charged him double.

7
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:39,632
You tried to overthrow the Crown
in conspiracy with its enemies.

8
00:01:39,734 --> 00:01:42,965
Unlike your simpleton king,
his enemies know

9
00:01:43,071 --> 00:01:47,405
that it is the true McCullen destiny
not simply to supply arms,

10
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:49,101
but to run the wars!

11
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,940
Do you have anything else to say
before the sentence is carried out?

12
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:53,536
Yes, I do.

13
00:01:53,648 --> 00:01:56,014
Clan McCullen is far greater
and more powerful

14
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:58,210
than any of you could ever imagine.

15
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,255
My sons will continue to rise
long after I am gone,

16
00:02:02,357 --> 00:02:03,722
as will their sons

17
00:02:03,825 --> 00:02:06,623
and, God willing, their sons.

18
00:02:06,728 --> 00:02:09,288
It shall not end with my death!

19
00:02:09,397 --> 00:02:12,798
We are not going to kill you, McCullen.

20
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:15,461
We're going to make an example of you!

21
00:02:18,106 --> 00:02:23,703
So that no man, woman nor child may
ever see your treacherous face again,

22
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:28,181
you shall wear this mask
for the term of your natural life.

23
00:02:28,283 --> 00:02:32,151
No! No! No! No!

24
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:48,058
For nearly four centuries,
my ancestors have been

25
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:50,933
the greatest creators of weaponry
in the world.

26
00:02:51,606 --> 00:02:53,972
But perhaps in this century,
I'll outdo them all.

27
00:02:56,945 --> 00:02:58,412
Nanomites, perfect little soldiers

28
00:02:58,513 --> 00:03:01,676
originally developed
to isolate and kill cancer cells.

29
00:03:01,783 --> 00:03:03,080
But at MARS lndustries,

30
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:05,651
and with the help
of a little NATO funding,

31
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:08,984
we discovered how to program them
to do almost anything.

32
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,684
For example, eat metal.

33
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,896
Watch this test
of the world's first nanomite warhead.

34
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:20,597
Each of these warheads
contains 7 million nanomites

35
00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:23,694
and has the ability to eat anything
from a single tank

36
00:03:24,806 --> 00:03:26,330
to an entire city.

37
00:03:29,177 --> 00:03:34,046
As you can see, it quickly converts
to eating any and all material in its path.

38
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:38,542
Once unleashed,
the nanomites will not stop, ever.

39
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:40,416
Once the target has been destroyed,

40
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:43,285
the launcher triggers
a kill switch unique to each warhead

41
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:47,691
that short-circuits the nanomites,
preventing any unwanted destruction.

42
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:50,889
Gentlemen, I'm pleased to announce
that tomorrow morning,

43
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:55,459
your first order of nanotech warheads
ships from my factory in Kyrgyzstan.

44
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:16,323
Weapons case on the move.
ETA two minutes to NATO team.

45
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,300
All right, listen up.
NATO wants the best of the best.

46
00:04:29,404 --> 00:04:32,032
That's why we're here.
We got Panthers front and back.

47
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,471
RHlNO's carrying the package
in the middle.

48
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:37,032
Minimum distance at all times.
Apaches are covering us from overhead.

49
00:04:37,145 --> 00:04:40,239
Detail, attention. Fall out, boys.

50
00:04:40,515 --> 00:04:42,779
Captain Hauser,
Mr. McCullen requires a signature.

51
00:04:42,884 --> 00:04:44,146
Not gonna explode, is it?

52
00:04:44,252 --> 00:04:46,618
They're not weaponized yet,
and the kill switches are inside.

53
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:49,519
All the same,
I'd avoid potholes if I were you.

54
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:52,892
-Hey, Bill?
- Yeah?

55
00:04:52,994 --> 00:04:55,019
Put that in the RHlNO, would you?

56
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:57,624
All right, ladies! Mount up!

57
00:05:16,084 --> 00:05:18,609
Okay, Apaches, we're heavy,
so keep your eyes open.

58
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,120
Roger that.
Skies are clear all the way to Ganci.

59
00:05:30,098 --> 00:05:33,067
-Hey, Duke, I've been thinking.
-You know, I warned you about that.

60
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,600
I've been thinking about
where we should transfer to.

61
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:36,329
-Don't say the Air Force.
- The Air Force!

62
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:38,667
What did I say? I thought
we were done with this conversation.

63
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:40,331
You were done with this conversation,
not me.

64
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:41,408
You know, I've been flying

65
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:42,567
-since I was 1 3 years old.
-Thirteen years old.

66
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:45,145
You know, I don't think your dad's
crop-duster counts as hours logged.

67
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:49,242
I'm talking jets, man. Jets.

68
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,183
And you know I qualify
every time we're on leave.

69
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,180
-You want to get up in the air?
- Yeah.

70
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:57,451
-I'll buy you a trampoline.
-I filled out the application.

71
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,384
Really? They accept those in crayon?

72
00:06:00,495 --> 00:06:02,224
Come on, dude.
Give me one good reason why not.

73
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,731
'Cause I want to be on the ground,
in the fight, not flying over it.

74
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:20,575
Pioneer 1, this is Pioneer 2,
going night vision.

75
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:22,581
-Roger that.
- Go ahead and back off.

76
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:24,480
Give me some separation.

77
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:26,951
Pioneer 1, this is Pioneer 2. Going NVS.

78
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:28,021
Roger.

79
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,550
Hey, Duke,
weren't we supposed to meet up

80
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,423
with the recon team at 40 klicks?

81
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:37,987
- Yeah. So?
-Well, we just passed kilometer 41.

82
00:06:40,268 --> 00:06:43,169
-Eyes out, eyes out!
-Sweep's still clear, sir.

83
00:06:43,271 --> 00:06:45,933
Roger that.
There's nothing up here but us.

84
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:56,548
Tom, put a self-test on the flare
and start to scan for...

85
00:06:56,651 --> 00:06:57,879
Holy...

86
00:06:58,352 --> 00:06:59,683
What the hell is that?

87
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:07,025
Pioneer 1, you've been hit.

88
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:12,892
Stop!

89
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:17,671
- Bird down! Bird down!
-Back up! Back up! Back up!

90
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:20,172
All units, we are under attack!
They're after the warheads!

91
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,298
Pioneer 2, engage!

92
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:24,435
-Put that asshole on the ground!
-Roger that. Put some hurt on this guy!

93
00:07:27,348 --> 00:07:29,908
Tommy guns. Firing, firing, firing!

94
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:33,915
- Missiles armed.
- Match and shoot.

95
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:35,420
Match and shoot! Missiles off!

96
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:41,285
They shot them right out of the air.

97
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:46,094
Oh, my God.

98
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,235
- Pioneer 2 is down! We've lost our air!
-They're boxing us in!

99
00:07:57,345 --> 00:07:59,905
All units, fan out!
I repeat, all units, fan out!

100
00:08:10,258 --> 00:08:13,159
I want SAMs on that thing!
Light him up! Light him up!

101
00:08:22,136 --> 00:08:24,036
He's coming around.
Get those.50s on him!

102
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:32,011
Incoming!

103
00:08:34,415 --> 00:08:35,643
Hold on!

104
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,484
You okay?

105
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:44,615
Yeah, but my leg is pinned.
What the hell was that?

106
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:34,133
-Come on, we gotta get in this fight.
-Careful, my leg!

107
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,765
Come on, buddy, let's go.
Let's go, get up, come on!

108
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,112
Duke, you gotta go get those warheads!

109
00:09:42,216 --> 00:09:44,446
Shut up! I gotta get you out of here first!

110
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,815
Fire at the opening!
Right side, right side!

111
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:56,592
Get up, get up, get up, get up!

112
00:09:58,532 --> 00:09:59,931
My damn leg!

113
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:03,034
-You wait here, okay?
-Where are you going?

114
00:10:03,137 --> 00:10:04,365
I gotta go get that case.

115
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:11,735
Air Force, right.

116
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:15,214
Don't move!

117
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,820
-Hello, Duke.
- Ana?

118
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:27,622
Now, you have to admit,
you had that coming.

119
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:40,230
Ana!

120
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,270
Ana!

121
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:20,310
Bye-bye.

122
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:29,217
Ana! Ana!

123
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:44,165
Don't make me shoot a woman.

124
00:11:47,408 --> 00:11:48,898
Incoming!

125
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,128
Stand down. Stand the hell down!

126
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:14,463
-Put the weapon down, sir.
-We're not the enemy.

127
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,798
Pointing your weapons at me doesn't
make you my friend, now, does it?

128
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:17,962
Please hand over the case, sir.

129
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:20,540
I don't know you, and I sure as hell
don't know who they are,

130
00:12:20,641 --> 00:12:22,472
and until I find out,
I'm not lowering anything

131
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:23,804
and I ain't handing anything over.

132
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:26,539
If it weren't for us, you'd be out there
with the rest of your boys.

133
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:29,241
- So hand over the case.
-What's your unit?

134
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,442
That's classified.

135
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:32,610
Someone would like to have
a word with you.

136
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:38,950
State your name and rank.

137
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:42,093
- You first.
-My team just saved your life, son.

138
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:44,357
This is the part
where you get to say thank you.

139
00:12:44,465 --> 00:12:45,830
Those aren't the words
that come to mind right now.

140
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:48,163
I wasn't told anything
about any support for this mission,

141
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:49,702
so why don't you tell your team
to stand down?

142
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:51,430
We could turn this
into one big turkey shoot.

143
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:52,699
Yep.

144
00:12:54,008 --> 00:12:55,134
Or not.

145
00:12:55,576 --> 00:12:57,237
Easy, Ripcord.

146
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:59,005
-How do you know me?
-Expert marksman,

147
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:03,049
second in your battalion.
Weapons specialist, jet qualified.

148
00:13:03,484 --> 00:13:04,917
-I told you.
-Not now, Rip.

149
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:09,513
My name is General Clayton Abernathy.
Perhaps you've heard of me, Duke.

150
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,490
General Hawk.
Afghanistan, NATO forward command.

151
00:13:12,593 --> 00:13:16,495
Yeah, that was my last job.
I'm in a whole new outfit now.

152
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:20,032
Hey, I just need to deactivate
the tracking beacon for security.

153
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:23,831
Put down that weapons case, son,
and let us deliver those warheads.

154
00:13:23,938 --> 00:13:25,667
No way. I signed for them.

155
00:13:25,773 --> 00:13:28,333
It's my mission, my package.
I carry them, I deliver them.

156
00:13:28,442 --> 00:13:31,878
Well, that's just fine, but you seem to be
a little short of transportation right now,

157
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:34,709
so my Team Alpha
will deliver you to me.

158
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:36,613
And where exactly are you, sir?

159
00:13:37,218 --> 00:13:39,049
Come see for yourself.

160
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,429
I thought all you Special Ops guys
were tough.

161
00:13:54,535 --> 00:13:57,129
We are tough. But we're also sensitive.

162
00:13:58,505 --> 00:13:59,767
I got it. Thanks.

163
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:02,501
Wow, this is some primo stuff here.

164
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:06,506
Hey, bro, you got
some real lifelike hair over there.

165
00:14:06,614 --> 00:14:08,138
And a kung fu grip.

166
00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:09,944
- Lie down.
-Okay.

167
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,517
What kind of outfit is this, anyway?

168
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:14,053
It's not regular Army,
based on all the accents.

169
00:14:14,455 --> 00:14:16,514
You're British.
What are you, French North African?

170
00:14:16,624 --> 00:14:18,148
Morocco. Where were you born?

171
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:20,454
Duke wasn't born.
He was government-issued.

172
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:23,394
-What about you?
-He doesn't speak.

173
00:14:23,497 --> 00:14:25,465
-Why?
-He doesn't say.

174
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:28,524
He doesn't say.
So, somehow you're all in the same unit,

175
00:14:28,636 --> 00:14:30,467
but one you can't tell me
the name of, right?

176
00:14:30,571 --> 00:14:31,833
We'd get tossed for telling.

177
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:34,840
You're gonna go after those guys
that hit my convoy, huh?

178
00:14:36,777 --> 00:14:39,644
Well, whoever you are
and whatever this unit is,

179
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,079
I want in.

180
00:15:17,318 --> 00:15:18,444
General.

181
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,151
-What's up, girl?
-Good job, Joes.

182
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:21,619
Outstanding.

183
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:25,255
Welcome to the Pit, Duke.
I've read a lot about you two.

184
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:27,520
Well, you can't believe
everything you read. See, I actually...

185
00:15:27,628 --> 00:15:30,426
I understand we even tried to recruit you
a few years back.

186
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:32,897
-I never got asked to join any Op group.
-Really?

187
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,366
You don't remember Thailand
about four years ago?

188
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:37,528
Right before you broke up that bar?

189
00:15:37,638 --> 00:15:39,230
About four years ago,
my boy had issues.

190
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,671
I mean, his issues had issues.

191
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:43,533
I've been in the military my entire life

192
00:15:43,644 --> 00:15:46,044
and I have never seen
a tac operation like this.

193
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:49,013
All right, you trusted me,
I guess I'll trust you.

194
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:52,244
Technically, G.I. Joe does not exist,
but if it did,

195
00:15:52,353 --> 00:15:54,514
it'd be comprised
of the top men and women

196
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:58,113
from the best military units in the world,
the alpha dogs.

197
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,088
When all else fails, we don't.

198
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:05,731
Ten nations signed on in our first year,

199
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:08,859
working together, sharing intel.
Now we have 23.

200
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:13,001
- What's that?
-Camouflage suit.

201
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,109
It photographs everything behind you
and puts it in front of you.

202
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:21,372
-Mr. McCullen is standing by, sir.
-Patch him through via TelePresence.

203
00:16:21,482 --> 00:16:23,177
- So who hit us?
-Currently unknown.

204
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:24,511
But one thing's for sure,

205
00:16:24,618 --> 00:16:27,178
she's got highly classified intel
and state-of-the-art weaponry,

206
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:29,118
which means there's a whole
hell of a lot of money behind her.

207
00:16:29,223 --> 00:16:31,783
Their capabilities are beyond anything
we've ever encountered.

208
00:16:31,892 --> 00:16:34,861
Yeah, that's the one and only reason
why we got our asses kicked out there.

209
00:16:34,962 --> 00:16:37,260
We need to find out
everything we can about her.

210
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:39,059
Knowing is half the battle.

211
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:43,496
Gentlemen, Mr. McCullen,

212
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:47,270
CEO of MARS lndustries
and the builder of these warheads.

213
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:50,138
General, clearly you were the
security option I should have chosen.

214
00:16:50,244 --> 00:16:54,010
What did you just say? My team
did everything we could out there,

215
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:56,981
-and a lot of good men went down.
-Yeah, but not you.

216
00:16:57,084 --> 00:17:00,713
That mission was classified,
so clearly someone sold us out.

217
00:17:00,821 --> 00:17:04,689
I spent 1 0 years and 1 3 billion euros
creating these four warheads.

218
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:07,454
Your job, Captain, was to protect them,

219
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:10,189
and if it wasn't for General Hawk,
you'd have failed.

220
00:17:10,297 --> 00:17:13,960
That's not a fair assessment.
He followed his orders to the letter.

221
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:16,433
Well, that wasn't enough.

222
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:19,506
Now, so the bastards who attacked you
can't find you,

223
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:22,131
you need to disable
the tracking beacon hidden in the case.

224
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:25,143
-We already have.
- Good man.

225
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:28,408
But allow me to check them
to see if any have been damaged.

226
00:17:36,857 --> 00:17:38,449
Open it, please.

227
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,027
My scan says they're intact, sir.

228
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:45,428
- What's the code?
- 5- 2- 9- 4- 4- 0.

229
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:12,122
Please keep me informed
of your progress, General.

230
00:18:16,697 --> 00:18:18,221
Breaker?

231
00:18:18,332 --> 00:18:22,132
My voice analyzer on that guy
was going up, down and sideways.

232
00:18:22,236 --> 00:18:25,637
Looks like McCullen's working an angle
he don't want us to catch.

233
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:28,999
We're on a deadline.
We need those warheads now!

234
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:32,101
You knew that!
Ten years setting this up,

235
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:36,114
wringing money out of NATO,
this was supposed to be the easy part.

236
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:39,083
If you had let me stage the assault
at your precious factory,

237
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:40,346
I could have contained the situation.

238
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:42,979
And lost the trust of our clients
in the process.

239
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,183
It had to be NATO's fault!

240
00:18:49,263 --> 00:18:50,730
What happened?

241
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,559
-Did you hesitate when you saw him?
- No.

242
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:57,369
This had nothing to do with him.

243
00:18:58,572 --> 00:19:00,301
Forgive my jealousy.

244
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:08,378
Have you tracked the case?

245
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:11,246
They, of course,
deactivated the homing beacon.

246
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,651
I gave them a code
to quietly reactivate it.

247
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:20,449
It's in Egypt.
The Pit, only mentioned in whispers.

248
00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:23,655
I will get those warheads back.

249
00:19:25,098 --> 00:19:26,588
I hope so.

250
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:32,867
If I were really there,
I might actually let you touch me.

251
00:19:32,973 --> 00:19:36,500
-I'll send a jet.
- Business first.

252
00:19:37,077 --> 00:19:39,477
Besides, I'm married, remember?

253
00:19:40,814 --> 00:19:44,648
If you had sent me in the first place,
it would already be done.

254
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:49,418
I'm sending you now, Storm Shadow.
No more mistakes.

255
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:52,492
The schedule mustn't be compromised
any further.

256
00:19:52,593 --> 00:19:54,618
Keep your eye on her for me.

257
00:19:54,728 --> 00:19:59,131
American politics,
governors, senators, congressmen.

258
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:00,961
No wonder nothing ever gets done.

259
00:20:01,068 --> 00:20:03,400
That's what we're going to fix,
Mr. Zartan.

260
00:20:31,632 --> 00:20:35,193
The king cobra, magnificent creature.

261
00:20:35,302 --> 00:20:38,635
Nature's Grim Reaper
and symbol of lethal purpose.

262
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:41,139
Unseen until it strikes.

263
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:44,668
Its venom can kill a full-grown elephant
with a single bite.

264
00:20:44,778 --> 00:20:47,975
-Very nice.
-So far we've created 20 Neo-Vipers.

265
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,879
-Nineteen stand before you.
-ls it working?

266
00:20:50,984 --> 00:20:56,115
We injected 1,000 cc of
the nanomite solution into each subject.

267
00:20:56,223 --> 00:20:58,919
When they finally stopped screaming,

268
00:20:59,026 --> 00:21:01,017
brain scans showed
a complete inactivity

269
00:21:01,128 --> 00:21:03,255
of the self-preservation region
of the cortex.

270
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:04,728
English, Doctor?

271
00:21:08,068 --> 00:21:10,263
They feel no fear.

272
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:17,534
Cortical nerve clusters
show complete inactivity.

273
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:23,641
They feel no pain.
Concepts of morality are disengaged.

274
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,686
They feel no regrets, no remorse.

275
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:34,619
The nanomites join together
as a fighting mechanism,

276
00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:38,391
first blocking, then expelling
the cobra's venom.

277
00:21:42,903 --> 00:21:45,030
And they're completely obedient?

278
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,471
Of course.

279
00:21:49,843 --> 00:21:52,744
The real-world applications are endless.

280
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:57,010
So, you tell me, is it working?

281
00:21:58,218 --> 00:22:01,187
Send a team to rendezvous
with Storm Shadow and the Baroness.

282
00:22:01,288 --> 00:22:05,554
Consider it done.
The Joes will never know what hit them.

283
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:12,089
The 20th Neo-Viper is already set up
in Washington, DC

284
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:13,393
and awaiting your signal.

285
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,731
You've done well. You've thrown
the caber clear out of the yard.

286
00:22:16,837 --> 00:22:19,738
Construction of the presidential bunker
has also been completed.

287
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,308
Now, if we sold one warhead
on the black market,

288
00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:23,671
I could continue my research.

289
00:22:23,777 --> 00:22:25,768
I appreciate your thirst
for knowledge, Doctor,

290
00:22:25,879 --> 00:22:28,177
but this world is messy enough. No.

291
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:32,811
What it needs is unification, leadership.

292
00:22:33,954 --> 00:22:38,448
It has to be taken out of chaos
by someone with complete control.

293
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:43,924
Beijing, Moscow, Washington...

294
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:46,025
When these missiles detonate,

295
00:22:46,133 --> 00:22:49,193
the world will turn
to the most powerful man on the planet.

296
00:22:50,771 --> 00:22:54,070
When I'm finished,
the money will take care of itself.

297
00:22:54,174 --> 00:22:57,200
You'll be able to do
all the research you want.

298
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:06,475
We grabbed this image
from one of our tactical cameras.

299
00:23:06,586 --> 00:23:09,350
Now we're running her face
through an infinity scan.

300
00:23:11,691 --> 00:23:13,181
Hey, isn't that...

301
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,820
We have access to any photograph
on any server, anywhere in the world.

302
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:20,093
Yep. Everyone gets photographed
in some way at some time.

303
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,361
Football game, ATM machine, airport...

304
00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:25,597
We'll find her,
and then we'll find out who sent her.

305
00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:27,969
-From NATO, sir.
-Are you okay?

306
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:30,602
What happened to her?

307
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:36,011
Well, it appears that I've been made
official custodian of the warheads.

308
00:23:36,116 --> 00:23:38,141
Looks like your mission
is complete here, Duke.

309
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:40,845
When you move them, she's gonna
come after you. You know that, right?

310
00:23:40,954 --> 00:23:43,616
And with her intel and toys,
she'll find you.

311
00:23:43,723 --> 00:23:44,690
What's your point?

312
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:47,521
You're going after her first
and we want in.

313
00:23:47,627 --> 00:23:50,653
General, it was our team that got wasted
out there. We deserve payback.

314
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:54,495
You don't ask to be part of G.I. Joe.
You get asked.

315
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:58,934
You scouted me four years ago.
Now I'm ready. Let's have at it.

316
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,836
Well, I've lost men, too, Captain.

317
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:02,568
-lf you want revenge...
- I know her.

318
00:24:02,676 --> 00:24:03,665
Excuse me?

319
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:06,405
You said
knowing's half the battle, right?

320
00:24:06,513 --> 00:24:08,447
Well, I know who she is.

321
00:24:08,915 --> 00:24:11,543
She was a blonde.
Her name is Ana Lewis.

322
00:24:11,651 --> 00:24:14,017
I could tell you everything
you need to know about her,

323
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,815
up until the last four years.

324
00:24:15,922 --> 00:24:18,186
After that, obviously,
a lot of things have changed.

325
00:24:38,411 --> 00:24:39,935
Finally, my wife is home.

326
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:47,418
Hello, Daniel. How was your meeting
with the Minister of Defense?

327
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,819
He was thrilled.
The accelerator performed flawlessly.

328
00:24:50,924 --> 00:24:53,256
I wish you would have been there.

329
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,624
You and your little lab rats
are so clever.

330
00:24:55,729 --> 00:24:58,357
- How was Monte Carlo?
-I didn't get what I was after.

331
00:24:58,465 --> 00:25:01,161
-I suppose I should be grateful.
- Most husbands would be.

332
00:25:01,268 --> 00:25:04,135
Most husbands don't have
such mysterious wives.

333
00:25:04,237 --> 00:25:06,467
They know exactly where they are
and what they do.

334
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:07,835
They think they know.

335
00:25:07,941 --> 00:25:11,104
Ana, I don't wanna fight. I missed you.

336
00:25:11,211 --> 00:25:13,543
Well, I never tire of a good fight.

337
00:25:15,448 --> 00:25:19,407
But not with you, darling. Let me
freshen up and I'll meet you downstairs.

338
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:22,579
I do love you, my beautiful Baroness.

339
00:25:28,762 --> 00:25:32,994
McCullen gave me orders to kill
the Baron if he so much as touched you.

340
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:35,932
Well, he's my husband.
Of course he touches me.

341
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:39,437
And besides, his work at the lab goes
much better after we've touched.

342
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:41,473
And that's the important thing.

343
00:25:42,108 --> 00:25:44,338
So what are you doing? Spying on me?

344
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:48,973
If I was spying on you,
you would never know.

345
00:25:52,485 --> 00:25:53,975
Getting closer.

346
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,656
You were my best student.

347
00:25:58,491 --> 00:26:01,187
I'll be coming with you
to retrieve the warheads.

348
00:26:01,294 --> 00:26:02,761
We go at dawn.

349
00:26:26,286 --> 00:26:27,651
Come on, Ana.

350
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:34,351
Okay, so, I've been wanting to do this
before we deploy.

351
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:45,736
Duke, it's beautiful. It's too beautiful.

352
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:48,706
I'm only going to buy one of these,
so why not?

353
00:26:51,478 --> 00:26:52,968
So what do you say?

354
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:55,877
Say yes, you idiot.
He's a real American hero.

355
00:26:55,982 --> 00:26:57,074
Thanks for ruining the mood, Rex.

356
00:26:57,183 --> 00:26:59,515
I apologize. I just came to offer you
a ride back to post.

357
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:01,348
What? It's time already?

358
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:04,252
-Yeah, we got to go at 0500.
- Is it...

359
00:27:05,058 --> 00:27:07,686
Yeah, it is, right? That's why
you're pulling Rex out of the lab.

360
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:12,094
-Ana, look, I'm sorry, but I can't...
-Yeah, yeah, classified, top secret,

361
00:27:12,198 --> 00:27:13,756
you'd have to kill me if you told me,
blah- blah- blah.

362
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:15,201
And speaking of classified information,
you still haven't answered me.

363
00:27:15,201 --> 00:27:17,863
And speaking of classified information,
you still haven't answered me.

364
00:27:19,172 --> 00:27:22,733
Yes. Yes. Of course it's yes.

365
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:25,535
On one condition.

366
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:29,680
You have to promise me
that you will not let my genius,

367
00:27:29,783 --> 00:27:31,751
egghead brother get hurt.

368
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:34,751
He's the only family I've got left.

369
00:27:35,855 --> 00:27:37,755
Promise me, Duke.

370
00:27:37,857 --> 00:27:39,188
I promise.

371
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:45,264
-Hey! My three favorite people.
-Mr. Weems. Good, man?

372
00:27:45,365 --> 00:27:46,593
- Yeah.
- Look.

373
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:50,396
Wow. Nice rock. That's a lot of love.

374
00:27:51,271 --> 00:27:53,068
-Are you proposing?
-I'm actually done proposing.

375
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:56,609
-I already said yes.
-Oh, my God! Congratulations!

376
00:27:56,709 --> 00:28:00,167
Beautiful! You guys are like the little
white couple on the wedding cake.

377
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,673
How cute. Give me some love.

378
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,980
Congratulations. Wait. It's not official.

379
00:28:06,086 --> 00:28:08,020
- What?
- It's not official.

380
00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:10,749
-Not until you answer my question.
-Okay.

381
00:28:11,925 --> 00:28:13,586
Do you love my boy?

382
00:28:15,495 --> 00:28:18,293
Always and forever.

383
00:28:22,936 --> 00:28:25,632
You may have blackmailed
your way onto this team.

384
00:28:25,738 --> 00:28:27,603
Doesn't mean I've got to like it.

385
00:28:28,174 --> 00:28:31,007
But it does mean
I've gotta get you mission ready,

386
00:28:31,411 --> 00:28:32,708
Joe style.

387
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,514
Standing in front of you
are Delta- 6 Accelerator suits.

388
00:28:37,617 --> 00:28:39,517
- What does it accelerate?
- You.

389
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:43,555
It'll make you run faster, jump higher
and hit harder than any of your enemies.

390
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,421
Let's suit up.

391
00:28:45,525 --> 00:28:49,689
Head-to-toe hydraulics
and highly pressurized pneumatics.

392
00:28:51,998 --> 00:28:54,933
An advanced cybernetics
heads-up display helmet,

393
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:56,763
which feeds into the suit.

394
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,838
You think it, it does it.

395
00:29:01,474 --> 00:29:03,271
Twin gas-propelled grappling spears

396
00:29:03,376 --> 00:29:06,436
and triple-explosive,
heat-seeking, fire-and-forget rockets.

397
00:29:06,546 --> 00:29:08,173
And my personal favorite,

398
00:29:08,281 --> 00:29:11,114
a 1 0- millimeter caseless
Gatling submachine gun,

399
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:15,449
capable of firing 50 rounds per second.
Fully self-contained firepower.

400
00:29:15,555 --> 00:29:17,648
Perfect for a couple of cowboys like you.

401
00:29:19,058 --> 00:29:21,754
I just missed everything you said.
Hey, how do I look?

402
00:29:21,861 --> 00:29:23,351
-Pretty cool, huh?
-Any questions?

403
00:29:40,647 --> 00:29:41,807
Yo, Sergeant Stone.

404
00:29:41,915 --> 00:29:44,611
-Are they Joes?
-Hell, no. They're jokes.

405
00:29:45,185 --> 00:29:46,243
Boys.

406
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,644
You're gonna need these.

407
00:29:54,928 --> 00:29:57,897
Just so you know,
when I get a target in my sights,

408
00:29:58,665 --> 00:30:00,155
I take it down.

409
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,194
Oh, shit!

410
00:30:05,071 --> 00:30:06,800
-Again.
-Again?

411
00:30:22,088 --> 00:30:26,218
Just so you know, some targets
are harder to hit than others.

412
00:30:31,464 --> 00:30:34,058
-Again.
-You're gonna need that helmet.

413
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:47,206
Stand down, Snake Eyes.

414
00:30:47,313 --> 00:30:49,281
All right. Walk away. It's over.
This ain't pay-per-view.

415
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,585
I'm nasty with it!

416
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:56,712
You missed one.

417
00:30:56,823 --> 00:30:58,723
Come on. That gotta be
some kind of a record or something.

418
00:30:58,825 --> 00:31:01,453
- The record is all 20 killed.
-Who did that? Let me guess.

419
00:31:01,561 --> 00:31:04,086
-Snake Eyes?
- No. Me.

420
00:31:04,197 --> 00:31:08,258
If you're gonna shoot at something,
kill it. Otherwise, take up knitting.

421
00:31:16,943 --> 00:31:18,638
Beginner's luck. Stay focused.

422
00:31:25,151 --> 00:31:27,016
-Again.
-Again?

423
00:31:33,326 --> 00:31:35,556
I have never seen Snake Eyes take a hit.

424
00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:37,787
They're Joes.

425
00:31:39,232 --> 00:31:40,290
Maybe.

426
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:48,032
Let's go.

427
00:31:48,775 --> 00:31:52,871
Hey, man, Breaker told me that Scarlett
graduated college at 1 2 years old.

428
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:55,373
She's like some freaky little
deadly genius.

429
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:57,847
-Rip. I get it, Rip. You like her.
-Sorry, my bad.

430
00:32:01,154 --> 00:32:04,646
- To hell with it.
-Rip. Rip.

431
00:32:07,327 --> 00:32:09,818
Into the valley of death rode the 600.

432
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:12,523
Hey, what are you doing?
A little beach reading?

433
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,324
Okay.

434
00:32:17,403 --> 00:32:21,100
Look, I think you and me
got off on the wrong foot.

435
00:32:21,641 --> 00:32:26,271
See, I'm attracted to you.
And you, you're attracted to me.

436
00:32:26,713 --> 00:32:28,305
And him, the damn Zen master,

437
00:32:28,414 --> 00:32:30,245
he creeps me out.
What I'm trying to say is...

438
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,818
- We're attracted to each other.
-Thank you!

439
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:35,615
That's what you're saying.
It's not what I'm saying.

440
00:32:36,255 --> 00:32:37,415
It's not?

441
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:40,253
So, what are you saying?

442
00:32:43,296 --> 00:32:46,823
Attraction is an emotion.
Emotions are not based in science.

443
00:32:46,933 --> 00:32:50,733
And if you can't quantify
or prove that something exists, well,

444
00:32:50,837 --> 00:32:52,737
in my mind, it doesn't.

445
00:32:54,407 --> 00:32:56,500
Okay. I'll get back to you on that one.

446
00:32:57,176 --> 00:32:59,644
Attention! General on deck!

447
00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:02,146
At ease. Duke,

448
00:33:02,248 --> 00:33:05,740
you scored in the top half percent
of all people we've ever tested.

449
00:33:06,386 --> 00:33:10,083
Rip, if we average your scores
with Duke's, you pass, too.

450
00:33:10,556 --> 00:33:11,955
- Welcome aboard.
-Thank you, sir.

451
00:33:12,058 --> 00:33:14,390
-Provisionally, of course.
-Thank you, sir.

452
00:33:34,046 --> 00:33:37,243
Sir, sensors detecting seismic activity
to the southwest.

453
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,045
Probably just a tremor,
but have a team check it.

454
00:34:27,467 --> 00:34:29,298
There's our little weapons case.

455
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:32,371
All right. You three, guard the machines.

456
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,995
-Sorry to disturb you, sir.
-That's all right, Corporal.

457
00:35:03,102 --> 00:35:06,902
I need you to sign here, here and here.
And also here, here...

458
00:35:18,384 --> 00:35:20,079
Goodbye, sweetheart.

459
00:35:25,391 --> 00:35:27,951
That's right. You don't kill women.

460
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,585
For you, Zartan, I'd make an exception.

461
00:35:59,025 --> 00:36:00,583
Warheads, Rip! Come on!

462
00:36:05,898 --> 00:36:07,024
Go, go!

463
00:36:11,137 --> 00:36:13,571
We've got the warheads.
Prep the Mole Pods for evac.

464
00:36:13,673 --> 00:36:15,800
-We're on our way.
-We're already on it.

465
00:36:32,525 --> 00:36:34,755
-Now how do we get out of here?
- Follow me.

466
00:36:37,096 --> 00:36:38,893
Like that's gonna happen.

467
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:51,970
Find the control room.
Open the exterior hatch.

468
00:36:52,078 --> 00:36:54,012
- And secure this area.
- We're on it.

469
00:36:58,985 --> 00:37:00,077
Clear.

470
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:12,022
Go, go!

471
00:37:14,967 --> 00:37:18,403
-Can you fly one of these things?
-Don't move! Ana, put the case down.

472
00:37:19,138 --> 00:37:21,606
Fine. Done.

473
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:26,178
Stop. Ana, stop right there.

474
00:37:26,278 --> 00:37:28,838
-You can't shoot me, can you?
- I will if I have to.

475
00:37:28,948 --> 00:37:31,644
Deep down, you're still the same man
I fell in love with.

476
00:37:31,751 --> 00:37:35,312
- Don't force this.
-What could have been. Right, Duke?

477
00:37:36,389 --> 00:37:38,721
Just give me the case, God damn it.

478
00:37:38,824 --> 00:37:43,887
-Move and I'm gonna blow her away.
-Do it. You already killed me once.

479
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:45,992
Duke, watch out!

480
00:37:58,577 --> 00:37:59,669
Ana, drop the case!

481
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,386
Hello, brother.

482
00:38:42,088 --> 00:38:43,146
Damn!

483
00:38:48,094 --> 00:38:49,356
Eat this!

484
00:39:13,452 --> 00:39:14,783
Hey, genius!

485
00:40:28,828 --> 00:40:30,159
See you, Duke.

486
00:40:59,058 --> 00:41:02,027
-How many warheads?
-Four, Mr. President.

487
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:05,290
-Any threats? Demands?
-None so far, sir.

488
00:41:05,397 --> 00:41:07,365
We take this to mean
the terrorists are unfocused.

489
00:41:07,466 --> 00:41:09,366
-No clear goals.
- No.

490
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:12,827
It means they intend to use them.

491
00:41:14,073 --> 00:41:15,597
General Hawk is stable now,

492
00:41:15,708 --> 00:41:18,040
but he won't be conscious
for another day or so.

493
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:19,872
He's one tough bastard.

494
00:41:32,024 --> 00:41:33,116
Hey.

495
00:41:36,228 --> 00:41:37,991
-You all right?
- I'm fine.

496
00:41:38,731 --> 00:41:41,564
-I didn't want anyone to see me like this.
-Why?

497
00:41:42,768 --> 00:41:44,827
I don't know. All the men we lost,
General Hawk wounded,

498
00:41:44,937 --> 00:41:46,564
my neck just doesn't seem important.

499
00:41:46,672 --> 00:41:50,665
You almost lost your life out there.
You have a reason to be concerned.

500
00:41:52,978 --> 00:41:55,071
First fight I lost since I was a kid.

501
00:41:56,882 --> 00:41:58,907
My father taught me to win.

502
00:41:59,018 --> 00:42:04,684
Look, I don't see how you could teach
anybody to win everything every time.

503
00:42:06,725 --> 00:42:08,158
I mean, look at you.

504
00:42:08,627 --> 00:42:10,117
You're still here, right?

505
00:42:10,596 --> 00:42:12,962
You get knocked down, you get back up.

506
00:42:13,098 --> 00:42:15,225
Maybe that's
what he wanted you to learn.

507
00:42:17,736 --> 00:42:20,637
But then again,
that would be an emotional response,

508
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:23,401
one that can't be explained or quantified.

509
00:42:40,426 --> 00:42:43,657
Hey. Looks like
we're all seeing ghosts today, huh?

510
00:44:22,157 --> 00:44:23,556
Storm Shadow!

511
00:44:27,529 --> 00:44:30,657
English, Storm Shadow.
Where are your manners?

512
00:44:31,032 --> 00:44:32,465
He is hungry.

513
00:44:32,867 --> 00:44:36,894
We need to invite him in
and show him the path.

514
00:44:37,372 --> 00:44:41,365
-He is a cur, a weakling!
-He does not fight like one.

515
00:44:46,981 --> 00:44:49,279
Now, what shall we call you?

516
00:44:55,557 --> 00:44:57,855
This belonged to an ancestor of mine.

517
00:44:58,626 --> 00:45:01,026
He was caught selling arms
to both sides.

518
00:45:01,129 --> 00:45:04,326
The French forced him to wear it
for the rest of his life.

519
00:45:04,432 --> 00:45:07,924
They called him Destro,
destroyer of nations.

520
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:09,903
So why do you keep it?

521
00:45:10,004 --> 00:45:12,666
So that I never forget
the most important rule in dealing arms.

522
00:45:12,774 --> 00:45:15,334
Let me guess. Never sell to both sides?

523
00:45:15,443 --> 00:45:17,911
Never get caught selling to both sides.

524
00:45:20,949 --> 00:45:23,213
Take the warheads to Paris.
Have them weaponized.

525
00:45:23,318 --> 00:45:25,445
-Then I want you to test one.
- Test one?

526
00:45:25,553 --> 00:45:28,249
We'll let CNN show the world
how well they perform.

527
00:45:29,691 --> 00:45:31,750
Fear is a great motivator.

528
00:45:35,163 --> 00:45:39,259
I have a target in mind,
one the French will never forget,

529
00:45:40,135 --> 00:45:43,434
as I've never forgotten
what they did to Clan McCullen.

530
00:45:53,348 --> 00:45:56,283
-Are you ready, Mr. Zartan?
-Born ready, Doctor.

531
00:45:56,384 --> 00:45:58,352
This is going to be
the achievement of a lifetime.

532
00:45:58,453 --> 00:46:01,422
Yes, as a master of disguise,
you have no equal, my friend.

533
00:46:01,523 --> 00:46:05,459
Eighteen months of studying my target,
learning mannerisms,

534
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,357
but the devil is in the details.

535
00:46:07,462 --> 00:46:10,226
Gentlemen, let's get it going.

536
00:46:10,331 --> 00:46:11,525
One more thing.

537
00:46:11,633 --> 00:46:14,227
I'll control my own brain,
thank you very much.

538
00:46:17,705 --> 00:46:19,036
Let's do this.

539
00:46:37,926 --> 00:46:41,453
-Wow. That was a bit nasty.
- Think so?

540
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:44,391
Let's run some tests.

541
00:46:46,034 --> 00:46:52,030
Eye color. Skin tone. Hair follicles.

542
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:56,374
And initiating facial reconstruction tests.

543
00:47:07,055 --> 00:47:08,750
We gotta find out
who's holding their leash.

544
00:47:08,856 --> 00:47:12,314
With their weaponry, financing
and intel, these guys are high-line pros.

545
00:47:12,427 --> 00:47:14,122
That limits the possibilities.

546
00:47:14,229 --> 00:47:17,528
-Hey, the weapons case.
- What?

547
00:47:17,632 --> 00:47:19,224
Remember, McCullen had us
open the weapons case?

548
00:47:19,334 --> 00:47:21,029
- What about it?
-I bet you he gave us a code

549
00:47:21,135 --> 00:47:23,296
that reactivated the tracking beacon.

550
00:47:23,404 --> 00:47:26,896
You're right.
McCullen, that son of a bitch.

551
00:47:27,008 --> 00:47:29,374
So, McCullen uses NATO
to fund his R&D

552
00:47:29,477 --> 00:47:31,138
and then he steals the warheads back.

553
00:47:31,246 --> 00:47:35,910
-And who says you're not a thinker?
-Hey, I found her.

554
00:47:37,051 --> 00:47:38,416
Yeah, that's her all right.

555
00:47:38,519 --> 00:47:42,421
Her name is Ana de Cobray.
Baroness, if you're feeling formal.

556
00:47:42,523 --> 00:47:46,050
Baroness? Wow, she really traded up,
huh? Financially, of course.

557
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,219
- Who's he?
-Daniel de Cobray.

558
00:47:48,329 --> 00:47:51,059
Big shot French scientist.
Runs a lab in Paris.

559
00:47:51,165 --> 00:47:54,100
- Lab? What kind of lab?
- Particle accelerator.

560
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:58,771
Oh, my God. They're going to use him
to weaponize the warheads.

561
00:47:59,674 --> 00:48:01,665
Well, that's where she's going.

562
00:48:01,776 --> 00:48:02,936
I like croissants.

563
00:48:34,642 --> 00:48:37,372
-Go, go, go, go!
-Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

564
00:48:37,578 --> 00:48:39,068
Pull up on the truck!

565
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:44,183
Go, go, go!

566
00:48:45,286 --> 00:48:48,380
- Two o'clock!
-Go, go, go, go, go!

567
00:48:48,489 --> 00:48:49,820
Go, let's move!

568
00:48:52,927 --> 00:48:55,555
-ln the alley!
-Get down, get down!

569
00:48:55,663 --> 00:48:56,960
You see them?

570
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:02,360
- Two more on the left!
- Get down!

571
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:04,938
Dubble Bubble? It always helps me.

572
00:49:06,641 --> 00:49:09,201
Yeah. Hey, you good?

573
00:49:10,011 --> 00:49:11,342
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

574
00:49:13,381 --> 00:49:16,043
All right, Mr. Science Officer,
you're up, okay?

575
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:18,050
You don't find it in four minutes,
you get out of there.

576
00:49:18,152 --> 00:49:22,145
That house will not be there in five.
I already called for the air strike.

577
00:49:22,256 --> 00:49:23,587
Come on! Here we go!

578
00:49:26,361 --> 00:49:28,226
I got you! Go, go, go, go!

579
00:49:30,298 --> 00:49:31,959
Oh, crap!

580
00:49:35,269 --> 00:49:36,463
Rooftop!

581
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,301
Hey, Duke, I gotta level with you.

582
00:49:41,409 --> 00:49:44,742
-I hate it when you level with me.
-It's going to be a long five minutes.

583
00:49:50,485 --> 00:49:53,682
No, no, no! It's too early. It's too early!

584
00:49:54,355 --> 00:49:56,983
- Duke!
- Rex! Rex!

585
00:50:17,044 --> 00:50:18,170
Rex.

586
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:24,084
Duke! Come on. We gotta go.

587
00:50:24,185 --> 00:50:25,675
-I gotta get Rex.
-We gotta go, man!

588
00:50:25,787 --> 00:50:28,585
Black Hawk's waiting! We gotta go!
Nothing you can do!

589
00:50:28,689 --> 00:50:30,657
-Nothing you can do, man! Come on!
-I gotta get Rex.

590
00:50:35,696 --> 00:50:38,290
Ready. Aim. Fire.

591
00:50:39,167 --> 00:50:40,794
Forward, march.

592
00:51:34,088 --> 00:51:36,215
Are you going to sign in or shall l?

593
00:52:00,648 --> 00:52:01,706
Ana?

594
00:52:03,651 --> 00:52:04,879
Who is this?

595
00:52:05,586 --> 00:52:07,053
Hey! What are you doing?

596
00:52:07,154 --> 00:52:09,088
-What's going on here?
-I need you to do something for me

597
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:11,021
and I don't have much time.

598
00:52:11,726 --> 00:52:13,455
What are these things?

599
00:52:13,561 --> 00:52:14,960
They're warheads, dear.

600
00:52:15,062 --> 00:52:18,725
And I need you to weaponize them
for me, or we'll kill everyone in here.

601
00:52:20,768 --> 00:52:23,532
Hey! This is a civilian laboratory!

602
00:52:24,238 --> 00:52:26,934
We don't have the correct
programming protocols for weaponizing!

603
00:52:27,041 --> 00:52:31,137
The protocols are in the case.
I told you, I don't have much time.

604
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:45,188
Hey, is that Dubble Bubble?

605
00:52:45,793 --> 00:52:46,953
But it's my last piece.

606
00:52:47,862 --> 00:52:50,558
-Come on, give it to me.
-All right, there you go.

607
00:52:50,665 --> 00:52:53,600
All right. Stick to the plan.
Scarlett, Snake Eyes, take the front.

608
00:52:53,701 --> 00:52:56,192
Rip, Duke, take the back.
Breaker will be our eyes and ears.

609
00:52:56,304 --> 00:52:57,532
I'll give the orders from here.

610
00:52:57,638 --> 00:53:00,402
-You do what I say, when I say. Got it?
-Yes, Daddy.

611
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:50,184
Here.

612
00:53:50,891 --> 00:53:53,018
-They're all alive.
-Merci, Daniel.

613
00:54:10,544 --> 00:54:13,445
I told you I'd kill him
if he touched you again.

614
00:54:13,814 --> 00:54:15,805
I heard you the first time.

615
00:54:21,489 --> 00:54:22,156
Okay, we're almost there.
Scarlett, you better put your suit on.

616
00:54:22,156 --> 00:54:24,420
Okay, we're almost there.
Scarlett, you better put your suit on.

617
00:54:34,669 --> 00:54:35,966
That's her.

618
00:54:43,077 --> 00:54:44,840
Take that Hummer, Snake!

619
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:11,429
Careful.
They're worth millions of dollars each.

620
00:55:11,539 --> 00:55:13,166
Millions of dollars. Got it.

621
00:55:14,508 --> 00:55:18,103
- Jesus.
-My bad. My bad. Won't happen again!

622
00:55:21,615 --> 00:55:23,014
Thanks a lot, buddy!

623
00:55:23,417 --> 00:55:26,909
Come on, Scarlett, babe. You in or out?
We gotta get in this fight!

624
00:55:38,566 --> 00:55:41,865
Tracking signal is good.
Don't let go of that truck, Snake Eyes.

625
00:56:15,035 --> 00:56:16,730
Let's get that bastard off the roof.

626
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:47,197
Look out!

627
00:56:50,604 --> 00:56:52,162
Hey, Heavy, it's getting thick out here!

628
00:56:52,273 --> 00:56:54,673
Yeah, I know. They're driving
right into the heaviest traffic.

629
00:56:54,775 --> 00:56:56,299
What kind of escape route is that?

630
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:59,402
Maybe they're not trying to escape.
Maybe they're heading somewhere.

631
00:56:59,513 --> 00:57:01,310
-Possible target?
- Yes.

632
00:57:03,818 --> 00:57:07,481
Some place with a lot of metal.

633
00:57:10,958 --> 00:57:14,860
-They're going to blow it up. All units!
-Guys, you have to stop them!

634
00:57:14,962 --> 00:57:16,361
Yeah, we're working on it.

635
00:57:16,564 --> 00:57:17,553
I mean right now!

636
00:57:17,665 --> 00:57:20,429
They're going to detonate one
of the warheads on the Eiffel Tower!

637
00:57:54,268 --> 00:57:55,394
Crush him!

638
00:57:56,604 --> 00:57:57,764
Snake!

639
00:58:03,611 --> 00:58:05,203
He's underneath. Kill him!

640
00:58:17,491 --> 00:58:19,959
That redhead is really starting
to piss me off.

641
00:58:23,597 --> 00:58:24,621
Shit!

642
00:58:25,733 --> 00:58:26,927
Oh, God!

643
00:58:28,502 --> 00:58:30,265
I got you. I got you.

644
00:58:31,705 --> 00:58:32,729
-Nice save, slick.
-Come on,

645
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,400
don't start being all nice to me now.
Gotta go.

646
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,240
Get in!

647
00:58:45,252 --> 00:58:48,221
All right, Rip, let's take this thing down!
Hang on, Snake!

648
00:58:57,131 --> 00:58:59,326
Try this on for size, boys.

649
00:59:14,214 --> 00:59:15,374
Oh, shit!

650
00:59:34,234 --> 00:59:35,758
We lost them!

651
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:37,628
Cut through that building
across the street.

652
00:59:37,738 --> 00:59:39,330
- Where's the door?
- Make one!

653
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,067
Right! Come on, Rip!

654
00:59:42,176 --> 00:59:43,939
I'm coming. I'm coming!

655
00:59:45,212 --> 00:59:47,180
I don't have them! Where are they?

656
01:00:09,503 --> 01:00:12,097
-They're evacuating the Tower.
-We're only 2 kilometers away.

657
01:00:12,206 --> 01:00:14,299
Snake, we're running out of time.
You gotta do something.

658
01:00:14,408 --> 01:00:15,705
It's now or never.

659
01:00:25,252 --> 01:00:28,244
-He gave up.
-He never gives up.

660
01:00:41,235 --> 01:00:42,429
Coming through!

661
01:01:04,324 --> 01:01:06,758
Okay, that was crazy.
I didn't expect that.

662
01:01:07,861 --> 01:01:10,295
-What happened to you?
-I went through the train.

663
01:01:10,397 --> 01:01:12,865
-What happened to you?
-I jumped over it.

664
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:16,326
- You can do that?
-Yeah. I told you to read that manual.

665
01:01:16,437 --> 01:01:17,870
There's a manual?

666
01:01:22,009 --> 01:01:24,477
Next time, I'll drive.

667
01:01:37,524 --> 01:01:39,754
Here. Take the kill switch.

668
01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:51,628
Come on. Get out of the way!

669
01:01:54,241 --> 01:01:56,402
Hey, guys, they're alive
and they're on the move.

670
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:59,775
And they've activated the warhead.
I'm tracking the kill switch now.

671
01:02:01,281 --> 01:02:02,475
Duke! Duke, it's on the Baroness!

672
01:02:02,583 --> 01:02:05,108
Storm Shadow has one of the warheads,
and it's armed!

673
01:02:15,929 --> 01:02:18,557
Get out of my way! Get out!

674
01:02:19,566 --> 01:02:20,999
Get out!

675
01:02:22,269 --> 01:02:23,293
Nice shoes.

676
01:02:34,081 --> 01:02:35,639
You get the warhead,
I'll get the kill switch.

677
01:02:35,749 --> 01:02:36,977
Yeah, I'm on it.

678
01:03:00,007 --> 01:03:01,668
Damn, that ninja's fast!

679
01:03:05,145 --> 01:03:06,169
No.

680
01:03:31,138 --> 01:03:32,366
Oh, no!

681
01:03:45,118 --> 01:03:47,279
-Bloody hell.
- No.

682
01:04:08,675 --> 01:04:10,040
They're gonna eat through
the entire city.

683
01:04:10,143 --> 01:04:11,906
Duke, you have to hit that kill switch!

684
01:04:44,311 --> 01:04:45,972
Oh, God.

685
01:05:08,769 --> 01:05:09,861
Disarmed.

686
01:05:23,450 --> 01:05:25,884
Congratulations, Duke.
You just saved Paris.

687
01:05:28,789 --> 01:05:30,313
Or at least most of it.

688
01:06:00,287 --> 01:06:03,415
- Is that blood?
-Spaghetti sauce. Don't ask.

689
01:06:04,358 --> 01:06:06,223
-They got Duke.
- We know.

690
01:06:06,626 --> 01:06:09,117
-What are you doing?
-Plugging into his cerebral cortex.

691
01:06:09,229 --> 01:06:10,253
I hate to break the news to you,

692
01:06:10,364 --> 01:06:12,628
but I don't think he's gonna
give you much in his dead condition.

693
01:06:12,733 --> 01:06:14,598
The brain survives
a couple of minutes after death.

694
01:06:14,701 --> 01:06:17,329
We can retrieve the electrical impulses
from his most recent memories

695
01:06:17,437 --> 01:06:19,530
-and convert them to images.
-Well, can we find Duke?

696
01:06:19,639 --> 01:06:21,197
We need to find
the other three warheads first.

697
01:06:21,308 --> 01:06:24,471
If this guy remembers his way home,
maybe we can find both.

698
01:06:25,312 --> 01:06:28,509
Okay, here come the images.
Let's see where this guy's been.

699
01:06:34,087 --> 01:06:35,111
- He's still alive!
- He can't be.

700
01:06:35,222 --> 01:06:36,280
He's got 3-inch needles in his head!

701
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:39,484
-Hey, dead guys don't breakdance!
-What's happening, Breaker?

702
01:06:39,593 --> 01:06:42,391
-Nanomites, they're eating him.
- Must be some sort of self- destruct.

703
01:06:42,496 --> 01:06:45,021
-Hurry, Breaker!
-Come on, come on, come on.

704
01:06:46,633 --> 01:06:48,567
No. No!

705
01:06:50,737 --> 01:06:52,136
No, no, no!

706
01:06:53,874 --> 01:06:56,342
The beauty of nanotechnology.

707
01:06:58,011 --> 01:07:00,206
- We are screwed.
-Relax. I got everything I could.

708
01:07:00,313 --> 01:07:02,440
What? Then what the hell was the,
"No, no, no, no!" for?

709
01:07:02,549 --> 01:07:03,709
That was for McCullen.

710
01:07:03,817 --> 01:07:06,513
-They were watching us.
-Okay. So what did you get?

711
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:07,985
Actually, not that much. Just images.

712
01:07:08,088 --> 01:07:09,988
Come on, Frenchie. I thought you said
you was the best at this.

713
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:11,387
- I am the best at this!
-All right.

714
01:07:11,491 --> 01:07:13,015
-Nobody can do what I just did.
-Okay.

715
01:07:15,629 --> 01:07:16,994
Wait, no.

716
01:07:17,497 --> 01:07:19,362
We didn't do it. We're the good guys.

717
01:07:21,101 --> 01:07:22,830
-Put your hands up, Rip.
- We don't have time for this!

718
01:07:22,936 --> 01:07:24,665
We're not allowed to engage
with friendly forces.

719
01:07:24,771 --> 01:07:27,672
They don't look too friendly to me.
I gotta get my boy.

720
01:07:27,774 --> 01:07:29,639
-Look, Captain...
-Rip!

721
01:07:54,801 --> 01:07:57,031
We're still trying to locate
the three remaining warheads, sir.

722
01:07:57,137 --> 01:07:59,935
- What's the status of the Joes?
-They've been detained.

723
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:03,498
-The French are pretty upset.
-Of course they're upset.

724
01:08:05,212 --> 01:08:06,645
Get me the French Ambassador.

725
01:08:15,188 --> 01:08:17,986
...in a matter of seconds
by a strike by a missile...

726
01:08:18,091 --> 01:08:19,422
Hey, no, no!

727
01:08:20,694 --> 01:08:23,720
Please don't touch that!
That's my equipment. It's very...

728
01:08:24,998 --> 01:08:26,625
Okay, he's touching it.

729
01:08:27,934 --> 01:08:30,027
-Nice going, slick.
- It's not his fault.

730
01:08:30,136 --> 01:08:32,229
He's just emotional.

731
01:08:32,806 --> 01:08:34,899
-Here, let me look at that.
- I'm fine.

732
01:08:35,008 --> 01:08:37,374
Just trying to help. General!

733
01:08:42,349 --> 01:08:48,049
The French have agreed to let you all go
on the condition that none of you return.

734
01:08:49,222 --> 01:08:50,246
Ever.

735
01:08:50,357 --> 01:08:52,518
- Never?
- It could be worse.

736
01:08:52,626 --> 01:08:54,253
What do you mean by never?
Like, never, never, ever?

737
01:08:54,361 --> 01:08:55,828
There's more.

738
01:08:55,929 --> 01:08:59,490
All of you have been recalled
by your respective heads of state.

739
01:08:59,599 --> 01:09:01,999
Team Alpha is to return to the Pit.

740
01:09:03,370 --> 01:09:04,928
What about Duke?

741
01:09:11,845 --> 01:09:14,143
Call McCullen.
Tell him we have the three warheads.

742
01:09:14,247 --> 01:09:15,475
Right away.

743
01:09:18,018 --> 01:09:19,986
Why didn't you just kill me?

744
01:09:20,086 --> 01:09:22,953
McCullen has something special
in mind for you.

745
01:09:23,056 --> 01:09:24,250
McCullen.

746
01:09:26,393 --> 01:09:27,917
What happened to you?

747
01:09:28,028 --> 01:09:29,393
Now you care?

748
01:09:30,797 --> 01:09:31,855
Okay.

749
01:09:33,233 --> 01:09:34,598
I am sorry.

750
01:09:35,802 --> 01:09:37,770
I'm sorry about Rex.

751
01:09:38,505 --> 01:09:41,099
I'm sorry that I couldn't bring Rex home.

752
01:09:42,042 --> 01:09:45,011
And I'm so sorry
that I couldn't face you afterwards.

753
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:48,845
Well, everybody's sorry
about something.

754
01:10:56,583 --> 01:10:57,948
Master!

755
01:10:58,518 --> 01:10:59,712
Master.

756
01:11:21,408 --> 01:11:23,672
Okay, so what about Duke?
We're just gonna forget about him?

757
01:11:23,777 --> 01:11:24,971
We've got our orders.

758
01:11:25,078 --> 01:11:27,012
Look, man,
what if it was one of your guys?

759
01:11:27,113 --> 01:11:29,604
What if it was Scarlett or Breaker?
What would you do then?

760
01:11:29,716 --> 01:11:32,082
Looks pretty remote.
Might be a good location for a base.

761
01:11:32,185 --> 01:11:34,949
Snow. That leaves us with what,
a third of the earth?

762
01:11:35,055 --> 01:11:36,215
Yeah.

763
01:11:38,425 --> 01:11:40,757
-Hey, is that McCullen's shadow?
-What you got?

764
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:43,226
-Spherical trigonometry.
- I must have missed that class.

765
01:11:43,329 --> 01:11:45,297
If you know the height of the object,
the length of the shadow,

766
01:11:45,398 --> 01:11:46,831
and the time and date
that the image was captured,

767
01:11:46,933 --> 01:11:49,128
-you can figure out its location.
-That's why I missed that class.

768
01:11:49,235 --> 01:11:50,998
All right, Breaker, give it to me.
What have we got?

769
01:11:51,104 --> 01:11:56,303
Okay. McCullen is 1 80 centimeters tall.
His shadow is 46 centimeters.

770
01:11:56,409 --> 01:11:58,138
This image has decayed 6%,

771
01:11:58,244 --> 01:12:01,611
which means
it's 51 hours and 1 7 minutes old.

772
01:12:02,148 --> 01:12:03,979
That's at the polar icecap.

773
01:12:04,084 --> 01:12:05,608
-Heavy.
-Yep.

774
01:12:07,353 --> 01:12:08,320
What do you say, sir?

775
01:12:08,421 --> 01:12:10,685
I said you've been ordered back
to the Pit,

776
01:12:11,825 --> 01:12:14,988
but I didn't say when
and I didn't say which route to take.

777
01:12:18,131 --> 01:12:19,621
Maybe a northern one.

778
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:38,508
That is a lot of ice.

779
01:12:38,618 --> 01:12:40,950
Thousands of miles across
and 1 0 stories thick.

780
01:12:41,054 --> 01:12:43,989
Locating McCullen's base will be
like finding a needle in a coal mine.

781
01:12:44,090 --> 01:12:46,115
-Haystack.
-Oh, right.

782
01:12:46,593 --> 01:12:48,254
Haystack in a coal mine.

783
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:39,269
No! McCullen has plans for him!

784
01:13:46,553 --> 01:13:47,747
Enough!

785
01:14:01,835 --> 01:14:03,359
And what was your plan?

786
01:14:03,970 --> 01:14:06,404
Run 3,000 miles across the ice?

787
01:14:11,611 --> 01:14:13,101
Stupid soldier.

788
01:14:21,588 --> 01:14:22,987
Move it.

789
01:14:23,456 --> 01:14:25,321
-That's strange.
- What?

790
01:14:25,658 --> 01:14:28,354
When they stole the weapons case,
I set my scanner

791
01:14:28,461 --> 01:14:31,726
to look out for the tracking beacon
in case it came back on.

792
01:14:31,831 --> 01:14:34,595
-And it just came back on.
-That's my boy!

793
01:14:55,688 --> 01:14:56,712
Three left.

794
01:14:56,823 --> 01:15:00,589
Take the warheads to the missiles.
I want them ready to launch in one hour.

795
01:15:00,827 --> 01:15:02,351
It will be done.

796
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:12,538
My beautiful Lady of the Lake.

797
01:15:21,114 --> 01:15:22,706
This bother you?

798
01:15:24,384 --> 01:15:28,514
It's funny, isn't it? The entire balance
of power in the world about to shift,

799
01:15:28,621 --> 01:15:32,022
two guys can still have a stare-down
over who gets the girl.

800
01:15:49,542 --> 01:15:51,669
I'm gonna make you very unhappy.

801
01:15:51,778 --> 01:15:53,746
-I'm already unhappy.
-Get up!

802
01:16:06,092 --> 01:16:08,686
Video from the Aqua Cam
is coming online now.

803
01:16:09,228 --> 01:16:10,661
Bloody hell.

804
01:16:10,997 --> 01:16:14,023
They've built a military base
under the polar icecap.

805
01:16:14,133 --> 01:16:17,034
It's the perfect location.
Nearly undetectable, easily defensible.

806
01:16:17,136 --> 01:16:19,696
-Duke's got to be in there somewhere.
- And the warheads.

807
01:16:19,806 --> 01:16:21,899
We have to find a quiet way
to get inside.

808
01:16:24,410 --> 01:16:27,174
Elevator cables.
They've got a surface entrance.

809
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:31,512
Guys, there's something else.
Going to sonar view.

810
01:16:32,218 --> 01:16:34,516
They've got tunnels
running through the ice pack.

811
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:36,884
Hey, look, they've got
their own attack subs.

812
01:16:36,990 --> 01:16:38,480
Okay, what's that?

813
01:16:38,591 --> 01:16:41,253
- Missile tubes.
- Must be for the nanomite warheads.

814
01:16:41,361 --> 01:16:44,626
Take us up. I'll create a distraction
from outside and keep them busy

815
01:16:44,731 --> 01:16:47,325
while you lot infiltrate the facility
from above. We'll find Duke...

816
01:16:47,433 --> 01:16:48,957
- Grab the warheads.
-Kill all the bad guys.

817
01:16:49,869 --> 01:16:53,066
As you all know,
Team Alpha is under direct orders

818
01:16:53,172 --> 01:16:55,606
to return to their
respective national bases.

819
01:16:55,708 --> 01:16:59,735
But I have something I need to do
which goes against all orders.

820
01:17:00,713 --> 01:17:03,443
So, if any of you decide
that you have to leave now,

821
01:17:03,549 --> 01:17:06,313
I will certainly not hold it against you.

822
01:17:16,329 --> 01:17:17,353
Okay, then.

823
01:17:18,564 --> 01:17:19,724
What are you gonna do
with the warheads?

824
01:17:19,832 --> 01:17:22,528
You take to your training well.
That's good.

825
01:17:22,635 --> 01:17:24,398
Still trying to develop intel.

826
01:17:24,504 --> 01:17:26,699
-So you won't mind telling me.
- lsn't it obvious?

827
01:17:26,806 --> 01:17:29,001
I'm a businessman.
I'm going to use them.

828
01:17:29,108 --> 01:17:30,710
Millions of people are gonna die
if you launch those warheads,

829
01:17:30,710 --> 01:17:31,574
Millions of people are gonna die
if you launch those warheads,

830
01:17:31,677 --> 01:17:32,701
so what is it that you want?

831
01:17:32,812 --> 01:17:36,942
To strike fear into the hearts of every
man, woman and child on the planet.

832
01:17:37,617 --> 01:17:39,847
Then they'll turn to the person
with the most power.

833
01:17:39,952 --> 01:17:41,010
You?

834
01:17:41,687 --> 01:17:43,177
No, not me.

835
01:17:43,289 --> 01:17:45,450
-You're not seeing the whole picture.
- Then tell me.

836
01:17:45,558 --> 01:17:47,583
I don't wanna spoil the surprise.

837
01:17:58,004 --> 01:17:58,993
Guests.

838
01:17:59,105 --> 01:18:01,938
Meet the genius
behind all my nanotechnology.

839
01:18:02,041 --> 01:18:04,771
Genius? You are too kind.

840
01:18:05,244 --> 01:18:08,372
As you can see,
we are loading my nanomite warheads

841
01:18:08,481 --> 01:18:10,312
into the high-V missiles.

842
01:18:10,416 --> 01:18:13,146
Once at maximum velocity, Mach 5,

843
01:18:13,519 --> 01:18:16,716
not even the Joes have
the technology to catch them.

844
01:18:16,823 --> 01:18:19,917
So, who's this? Another recruit?

845
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:22,918
Albeit a rather unwilling one.

846
01:18:23,029 --> 01:18:25,463
I'll prepare him for the procedure.

847
01:18:46,686 --> 01:18:49,314
All teams, listen up,
this is General Hawk.

848
01:18:49,422 --> 01:18:52,516
The mission is a go.
I say again, the mission is a go.

849
01:18:53,226 --> 01:18:54,193
Good luck, Joes.

850
01:19:24,557 --> 01:19:27,117
-The teams have been deployed, sir.
-Get me a satellite uplink.

851
01:19:27,226 --> 01:19:29,694
I wanna see everything
that's going on down there.

852
01:19:42,542 --> 01:19:43,702
You picking up anything?

853
01:19:43,809 --> 01:19:46,175
Negative.
There's nothing on the scanner.

854
01:19:58,791 --> 01:20:00,520
-Nice shooting.
-Thank you.

855
01:20:02,428 --> 01:20:04,157
We're a long way from Miami.

856
01:20:05,598 --> 01:20:08,431
That's a Night Raven.
They actually built one.

857
01:20:08,534 --> 01:20:11,094
Looks fast.
That McCullen got some gadgets.

858
01:20:12,505 --> 01:20:17,943
MARS lndustries manufactures
70% of all arms on this planet.

859
01:20:18,344 --> 01:20:20,039
70%.

860
01:20:21,113 --> 01:20:24,139
Did you know that, Duke?

861
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:29,551
There are two sides to McCullen's
operation, the Sword and the Shield.

862
01:20:29,922 --> 01:20:32,390
The Sword creates and sells weaponry.

863
01:20:32,491 --> 01:20:36,894
The Shield creates defensive
technology, like high-tech bunkers,

864
01:20:36,996 --> 01:20:39,055
which are supposed
to protect one from anything

865
01:20:39,165 --> 01:20:42,066
from a nuclear blast
to a nanomite warhead.

866
01:20:42,168 --> 01:20:46,400
Unfortunately, the bunker
in which I took shelter

867
01:20:46,505 --> 01:20:48,200
was just a prototype.

868
01:20:48,307 --> 01:20:49,740
Who are you?

869
01:21:02,455 --> 01:21:03,683
Rex?

870
01:21:04,790 --> 01:21:07,384
You son of a bitch! Ana buried you!

871
01:21:07,493 --> 01:21:09,927
Moving ceremony, I'm sure.

872
01:21:10,029 --> 01:21:12,088
The three-volley salute.

873
01:21:12,198 --> 01:21:15,190
Boots on the ground.
A folded flag in her arms.

874
01:21:15,301 --> 01:21:17,735
Why? Why didn't you just come in?

875
01:21:17,837 --> 01:21:20,772
Because I discovered something.

876
01:21:23,976 --> 01:21:26,308
...subject number 23.

877
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:30,080
This will only hurt a little.

878
01:21:30,182 --> 01:21:32,582
What comes next, more so.

879
01:21:32,685 --> 01:21:35,153
Listen, Mindbender,
do whatever it takes.

880
01:21:35,254 --> 01:21:36,721
So will I.

881
01:21:36,822 --> 01:21:40,087
Remember, science requires sacrifice.

882
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:43,828
-It's beautiful, isn't it?
-Stay where you are!

883
01:21:45,264 --> 01:21:47,027
Are you going to shoot me?

884
01:21:49,368 --> 01:21:52,269
These aren't chemical or nuclear,
are they?

885
01:21:52,371 --> 01:21:53,531
No.

886
01:21:53,639 --> 01:21:55,937
They're something much, much better.

887
01:21:56,042 --> 01:21:57,407
It is beautiful.

888
01:21:59,445 --> 01:22:01,777
Nanomites, it's beyond...

889
01:22:02,281 --> 01:22:04,715
It's light years ahead
of what anyone else is doing in the field.

890
01:22:05,418 --> 01:22:06,908
Proximity alert.

891
01:22:07,019 --> 01:22:10,716
Aerial attack imminent.
All personnel to the bunker.

892
01:22:15,394 --> 01:22:18,056
Come on. Come on! What?

893
01:22:18,164 --> 01:22:20,496
What are you doing?
Don't close that. Don't...

894
01:22:21,934 --> 01:22:25,199
If we live, I'll show you everything.

895
01:22:29,909 --> 01:22:33,811
We survived that blast, somewhat.

896
01:22:33,913 --> 01:22:38,213
And Dr. Mindbender and I escaped
with his research, which I perfected

897
01:22:38,317 --> 01:22:41,377
and which you will
now experience first-hand.

898
01:22:41,487 --> 01:22:43,751
Does Ana know about this? About you?

899
01:22:43,856 --> 01:22:46,416
No, and she never will.

900
01:22:48,994 --> 01:22:50,552
Commence the launch sequence.

901
01:22:50,663 --> 01:22:56,226
Commencing launch sequence.
T-minus four, three, two, one.

902
01:22:56,669 --> 01:22:58,102
Ignite primary engines.

903
01:22:59,672 --> 01:23:01,264
We have ignition.

904
01:23:07,079 --> 01:23:08,876
They're launching the missiles!

905
01:23:45,151 --> 01:23:48,416
We lost the Beijing missile.
Warhead three is down, sir.

906
01:23:48,521 --> 01:23:50,546
- Alert all defenses.
-Yes, sir.

907
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:51,953
He's here.

908
01:24:03,569 --> 01:24:05,935
- What about the other two?
-We gotta find the kill switches.

909
01:24:06,038 --> 01:24:07,198
They're already way too far out of range.

910
01:24:07,306 --> 01:24:10,002
Somebody has to get up there
and shoot those things down.

911
01:24:10,109 --> 01:24:13,408
Well, I guess that's me.

912
01:24:14,213 --> 01:24:15,510
- Sir.
- What is it?

913
01:24:15,614 --> 01:24:17,548
STRATCOM is tracking three warheads

914
01:24:17,650 --> 01:24:19,413
that have just launched off
the polar icecap.

915
01:24:19,518 --> 01:24:20,507
One was downed immediately.

916
01:24:20,619 --> 01:24:22,519
The other two are currently entering
the upper atmosphere.

917
01:24:22,621 --> 01:24:24,054
We need to get you
down to the bunker, sir.

918
01:24:24,156 --> 01:24:26,818
Well, they haven't made any demands.
What's their plan?

919
01:24:29,195 --> 01:24:31,186
Now, this is very cool.

920
01:24:31,697 --> 01:24:33,995
-Yeah, but can you fly it?
-I can fly anything.

921
01:24:34,099 --> 01:24:36,624
You just find a way
to guide me to those warheads.

922
01:24:36,735 --> 01:24:38,999
-Right. Ripcord...
- Yeah?

923
01:24:41,907 --> 01:24:43,670
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

924
01:24:44,043 --> 01:24:45,772
-Hey, do me a favor.
- Yeah?

925
01:24:45,878 --> 01:24:47,937
- Save Duke.
-You got it.

926
01:24:57,523 --> 01:24:58,785
Let's go!

927
01:25:10,135 --> 01:25:12,433
The floor is pressure-plated
and laser-protected.

928
01:25:12,538 --> 01:25:15,735
Anything larger than a quarter
that touches that floor gets fried.

929
01:25:18,777 --> 01:25:22,975
You left me for dead, Duke,
and look at me.

930
01:25:24,149 --> 01:25:26,743
Now you'll know what it's like
to be a monster.

931
01:25:34,193 --> 01:25:36,093
- We don't have much time.
- Ana?

932
01:25:45,971 --> 01:25:47,461
Oh, my God.

933
01:25:49,308 --> 01:25:51,868
- Ana!
-Security, to the operating chamber!

934
01:25:51,977 --> 01:25:54,502
- Rex!
-I press this, she dies.

935
01:25:54,613 --> 01:25:57,844
-You did this to your own sister!
-I loved my sister.

936
01:25:57,950 --> 01:26:01,852
Do you have any idea the state
she was in with me dead, you gone?

937
01:26:03,155 --> 01:26:06,124
Have you ever felt truly alone?

938
01:26:07,059 --> 01:26:11,086
I gave her a way to deal with the pain.
I gave her purpose.

939
01:26:11,297 --> 01:26:14,130
You could have stopped all of this
just by letting her know you were alive!

940
01:26:14,233 --> 01:26:16,428
Science requires sacrifice.

941
01:26:16,535 --> 01:26:18,969
All she's done was because of you!

942
01:26:19,071 --> 01:26:22,165
And because of you, Duke.
You abandoned her.

943
01:26:22,274 --> 01:26:25,471
-Let's not forget that point.
-I'm gonna kill you, Rex.

944
01:26:30,115 --> 01:26:32,140
- Is she still alive?
- For now.

945
01:26:32,251 --> 01:26:34,913
I thought we had complete control.
You said this couldn't happen.

946
01:26:35,020 --> 01:26:36,044
I didn't think it could.

947
01:26:36,155 --> 01:26:39,784
I've never seen anyone override
the programming, even momentarily.

948
01:26:39,892 --> 01:26:41,621
She did this for him.

949
01:26:42,227 --> 01:26:45,788
The pain must have been excruciating.

950
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:55,932
What you'll have to do

951
01:26:56,041 --> 01:26:59,704
is to rewire the laser panel's brain
by carefully...

952
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:03,778
-Or you can just stab it.
- This is Scarlett. We're in.

953
01:27:04,683 --> 01:27:05,707
Deploy the SHARCs!

954
01:27:06,485 --> 01:27:07,747
Detaching SHARCs 1-3...

955
01:27:07,853 --> 01:27:10,754
Detaching SHARCs
Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta.

956
01:27:10,856 --> 01:27:13,347
-Full speed ahead.
-Detaching SHARCs.

957
01:27:13,459 --> 01:27:16,860
SHARCs Victor, Franklin, Tango
into flanking positions.

958
01:27:16,962 --> 01:27:19,294
All right, boys. Attack formation.

959
01:27:32,711 --> 01:27:35,305
Fan out.
Wait until the Joes break formation.

960
01:27:35,714 --> 01:27:38,444
Stay tight. Here they come.

961
01:28:01,006 --> 01:28:03,406
-Fire up the pulse cannon!
-We're on it, sir.

962
01:28:06,845 --> 01:28:08,244
- I'll do it!
- Put it down!

963
01:28:08,347 --> 01:28:09,837
Your choice, Duke.

964
01:28:10,582 --> 01:28:12,174
Charging pulse cannon.

965
01:28:24,763 --> 01:28:26,458
Everybody stay tight on the enemy craft.

966
01:28:26,565 --> 01:28:28,430
Don't let that cannon catch you
out in the open.

967
01:28:28,534 --> 01:28:30,229
Bogey at 10 o'clock.

968
01:28:30,335 --> 01:28:32,064
I'm hit! I'm hit! I'm hit!

969
01:28:33,172 --> 01:28:36,835
Missile 2, all telemetry
and propulsion systems nominal.

970
01:29:04,837 --> 01:29:07,067
-Ripcord, can you hear me?
-Loud and clear, buddy.

971
01:29:07,172 --> 01:29:09,299
Doing Mach 6 and loving it!

972
01:29:10,175 --> 01:29:12,143
Come on, girl.
Time to show me what you got.

973
01:29:14,747 --> 01:29:17,648
Okay, Rip, I have the coordinates
of the other two warheads.

974
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:20,412
The closest target is Moscow.
You'll have to hit that one first.

975
01:29:20,519 --> 01:29:22,009
Target two is Washington.

976
01:29:26,325 --> 01:29:27,724
You'll be safe down in this bunker, sir.

977
01:29:27,826 --> 01:29:30,556
-How soon before it strikes the city?
-Seventeen minutes, sir.

978
01:29:30,662 --> 01:29:33,062
-It's all up to the Joes now.
-Please hurry, Mr. President.

979
01:29:33,165 --> 01:29:34,860
We need to get you buttoned up.

980
01:29:52,951 --> 01:29:55,818
General Hawk, we've lost our engines.
We're completely disabled.

981
01:29:55,921 --> 01:29:59,015
Somebody take out that damn cannon.
There's 200 Joes on that sub.

982
01:29:59,124 --> 01:30:01,058
We're on it, sir. All right, Snake,

983
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:02,457
the cannon control room
should be right there,

984
01:30:02,561 --> 01:30:04,461
where all the laser conduits converge.

985
01:30:05,464 --> 01:30:09,025
Did you think she loved you?
Did you imagine your life with her?

986
01:30:09,535 --> 01:30:11,400
All I know is,
neither one of you deserve her.

987
01:30:11,503 --> 01:30:13,994
- That's it. She dies!
-Don't do it, Rex!

988
01:30:27,019 --> 01:30:28,281
Come on.

989
01:30:30,589 --> 01:30:31,817
I'm gonna get you out of here.

990
01:30:33,859 --> 01:30:34,985
Get up!

991
01:30:35,627 --> 01:30:37,288
You're coming with me.

992
01:30:53,545 --> 01:30:56,912
Ripcord, the Moscow missile
will impact in four minutes.

993
01:30:57,015 --> 01:30:58,505
All right, I got a visual on it.

994
01:30:59,017 --> 01:31:00,143
Dead ahead.

995
01:31:01,086 --> 01:31:03,350
You have to knock it down
before it re-enters the atmosphere.

996
01:31:03,455 --> 01:31:05,150
If those nanomites hit the ground,
it's all over.

997
01:31:05,324 --> 01:31:06,621
They'll destroy the whole city.

998
01:31:06,725 --> 01:31:08,249
Houston, we have a problem.

999
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:11,659
- The fire controls are not in here.
-What do you mean, not in there?

1000
01:31:11,997 --> 01:31:13,658
I mean, I don't see them anywhere.

1001
01:31:14,533 --> 01:31:15,898
It must be voice- activated.

1002
01:31:16,001 --> 01:31:17,229
Okay. Fire!

1003
01:31:19,238 --> 01:31:22,332
Shoot! Blast away! Bust a cap!

1004
01:31:23,909 --> 01:31:27,003
-Nothing's happening!
-I bet it's in a different language.

1005
01:31:27,112 --> 01:31:30,275
Wait a minute. McCullen is Scottish.
Maybe the plane responds to Celtic.

1006
01:31:30,382 --> 01:31:33,442
-Try Teine.
- What?

1007
01:31:33,552 --> 01:31:37,420
-Teine. It's Celt, Scottish for fire.
-Okay, got it.

1008
01:31:46,365 --> 01:31:48,731
Nice going, ace.
You just saved Moscow.

1009
01:31:48,834 --> 01:31:51,598
Just doing my job.
Now guide me to Washington.

1010
01:31:57,976 --> 01:32:01,070
Yeah. Yeah, thanks, that's great news.
I'll let him know.

1011
01:32:01,179 --> 01:32:04,012
Sir, one of the Joes shot down
the warhead heading for Moscow.

1012
01:32:04,116 --> 01:32:05,413
Thank God.

1013
01:32:10,088 --> 01:32:12,352
What are you doing? Oh, my God!

1014
01:32:17,562 --> 01:32:18,927
It's done.

1015
01:32:31,910 --> 01:32:35,641
Hello, Mr. President.
Mr. McCullen sends his regards.

1016
01:32:36,515 --> 01:32:37,948
Oh, my God.

1017
01:32:39,885 --> 01:32:41,614
So, that's what this is all about.

1018
01:32:44,122 --> 01:32:46,090
All right. Keep tight, boys.

1019
01:32:46,191 --> 01:32:49,058
All guns on that cannon.
Torpedoes away!

1020
01:33:00,872 --> 01:33:01,998
I've just lost my wingman.

1021
01:33:02,107 --> 01:33:04,166
Retargeting Joe submarine.

1022
01:33:06,678 --> 01:33:08,236
I've got a shot.

1023
01:33:29,067 --> 01:33:32,332
Pulse cannon fault. Pulse cannon fault.

1024
01:33:33,005 --> 01:33:35,030
Cannon now offline.

1025
01:33:45,384 --> 01:33:48,683
-The whole damn system's down.
-I'm trying to bring it back online.

1026
01:33:55,694 --> 01:33:56,752
Now you die.

1027
01:34:19,718 --> 01:34:20,980
Launch immediately.

1028
01:34:21,086 --> 01:34:23,077
-Chart a course up to the ice pack.
-Yes, sir.

1029
01:34:38,637 --> 01:34:41,105
-We gotta go after Rex and McCullen.
- How could it be Rex?

1030
01:34:42,707 --> 01:34:44,572
Hey, Scarlett, it's Duke!

1031
01:34:44,676 --> 01:34:46,303
- He looks fine.
-But what's he doing with her?

1032
01:34:58,557 --> 01:35:01,685
Okay, we got a track on McCullen's sub.
He's headed up into the ice pack.

1033
01:35:04,796 --> 01:35:05,922
Duke, behind us!

1034
01:35:09,668 --> 01:35:11,829
Looks like they're onto us.
Ana, shoot those guys.

1035
01:35:11,937 --> 01:35:12,995
Love to.

1036
01:35:57,315 --> 01:36:01,012
When our master was killed,
you took a vow of silence.

1037
01:36:01,786 --> 01:36:04,084
Now you will die without a word.

1038
01:36:08,093 --> 01:36:10,425
All right, the second one in my sights.

1039
01:36:10,529 --> 01:36:13,726
Okay, Rip, you only got 30 seconds
before it enters the lower atmosphere.

1040
01:36:26,912 --> 01:36:28,004
I got you!

1041
01:36:36,221 --> 01:36:37,711
-Ripcord, you missed.
- The warhead has entered

1042
01:36:37,822 --> 01:36:38,811
the lower atmosphere.

1043
01:36:38,924 --> 01:36:40,892
I know, I know! I'm on it, I'm on it!

1044
01:36:44,796 --> 01:36:45,854
Shit!

1045
01:36:47,999 --> 01:36:50,263
-I can't shake these guys.
-Duke, I'm out!

1046
01:36:50,635 --> 01:36:53,229
-All right, let's see what we got here.
-Black Ray, Eliminator, LAW.

1047
01:36:53,338 --> 01:36:56,000
Laser Artillery Weapon.
That sounds good.

1048
01:37:02,380 --> 01:37:03,574
- Scarlett!
-Hey, Duke!

1049
01:37:03,682 --> 01:37:04,740
I'm going after McCullen and Rex.

1050
01:37:04,849 --> 01:37:05,907
You guys better get the hell out of there.

1051
01:37:06,017 --> 01:37:08,042
I can't. Rip has one more warhead
to take down.

1052
01:37:08,153 --> 01:37:09,142
Rip, where is he?

1053
01:37:16,494 --> 01:37:19,292
The missile's just gone drone.
It's going in for the kill!

1054
01:38:21,359 --> 01:38:23,793
Sir, there's a hostile Mantis craft
coming up behind us.

1055
01:38:23,895 --> 01:38:25,192
- Seal the door.
- Sir.

1056
01:38:31,636 --> 01:38:33,126
There you are.

1057
01:38:43,081 --> 01:38:44,946
One got through. I hit them!

1058
01:38:47,652 --> 01:38:49,449
Duke! They're back!

1059
01:38:53,358 --> 01:38:55,690
Going hot in three, two, one.

1060
01:39:08,440 --> 01:39:11,102
There's gotta be another way around
to Rex and McCullen.

1061
01:39:11,209 --> 01:39:13,541
Charting new course for alternate route.

1062
01:39:21,619 --> 01:39:23,610
Twenty seconds until impact.

1063
01:39:23,722 --> 01:39:25,212
Come on, come on, come on.

1064
01:39:28,626 --> 01:39:30,253
You're too close, Rip! Back off!

1065
01:39:30,362 --> 01:39:34,389
Actually, I think
I'm just about close enough.

1066
01:39:52,117 --> 01:39:53,948
He's taking the nanomites
back into the upper atmosphere.

1067
01:40:03,795 --> 01:40:06,161
Ripcord, get out of that plane!

1068
01:40:06,264 --> 01:40:07,959
Almost there!

1069
01:40:10,602 --> 01:40:12,331
Eject, Ripcord, eject!

1070
01:40:22,547 --> 01:40:25,038
He did it. He actually did it.

1071
01:40:25,650 --> 01:40:26,810
Ripcord?

1072
01:40:29,354 --> 01:40:30,685
Ripcord?

1073
01:40:33,224 --> 01:40:34,282
Ripcord!

1074
01:40:34,392 --> 01:40:36,383
Didn't I ask you not to yell at me?

1075
01:40:38,997 --> 01:40:43,195
Everybody, listen up! We still have
a lot of Joes out there in harm's way.

1076
01:40:43,301 --> 01:40:44,427
Let's bring them home.

1077
01:40:47,839 --> 01:40:50,467
- Did it work?
-Yes, yes, it worked.

1078
01:40:51,810 --> 01:40:55,576
Good. Because I think
I'm about to get arrested, again.

1079
01:40:57,182 --> 01:40:58,171
Don't move!

1080
01:40:58,283 --> 01:40:59,841
-Hey, hey, same team, same team!
-Hands up!

1081
01:40:59,951 --> 01:41:01,612
Same team.

1082
01:41:01,719 --> 01:41:03,346
Okay, okay, okay.

1083
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:12,088
- What's our status?
- We've lost aft thrusters and the sonar.

1084
01:41:12,197 --> 01:41:15,826
-We're running blind.
- Kill them. Kill all the Joes.

1085
01:41:15,934 --> 01:41:18,801
-Detonate the ice pack.
-Right away, sir.

1086
01:41:27,111 --> 01:41:30,239
They're telling the other ships to abort.
He's gonna blow the ice pack.

1087
01:41:30,348 --> 01:41:32,942
This is Duke calling all Joes.
The ice pack's coming down!

1088
01:41:33,051 --> 01:41:34,211
There's a ton of steel and ice

1089
01:41:34,319 --> 01:41:35,308
-headed your way!
- What?

1090
01:41:39,357 --> 01:41:42,053
Everybody, pull back! Pull back now!

1091
01:41:48,333 --> 01:41:50,426
Door! The door, the door! Get the door!

1092
01:41:53,805 --> 01:41:55,067
Come on!

1093
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:05,916
Ana, we could get out of here right now,
free and clear, safe and sound.

1094
01:42:09,320 --> 01:42:11,914
-Let's get them.
-That's my girl.

1095
01:42:25,036 --> 01:42:27,869
-This is cutting it close, Duke.
-I'm not letting those two get away.

1096
01:42:31,042 --> 01:42:32,703
Come on, guys, get out of there!

1097
01:42:40,652 --> 01:42:41,949
Snake!

1098
01:43:22,093 --> 01:43:24,960
- This is Scarlett. We're all clear.
-This is Duke. We're clear, too.

1099
01:43:25,063 --> 01:43:26,690
Yo, Joe!

1100
01:43:32,737 --> 01:43:34,102
Yeah!

1101
01:43:51,522 --> 01:43:54,116
Now that we have
a moment to ourselves,

1102
01:43:55,093 --> 01:43:56,526
I've designed something

1103
01:43:56,628 --> 01:43:59,597
-especially for you, James.
- No!

1104
01:44:01,165 --> 01:44:03,099
This will only hurt a little.

1105
01:44:04,936 --> 01:44:08,372
What comes next, more so.

1106
01:44:13,444 --> 01:44:16,777
Nanomites, perfect little healers.

1107
01:44:30,395 --> 01:44:34,092
I've finally taken my place
in a long line of McCullens.

1108
01:44:34,198 --> 01:44:40,398
James McCullen is no more.
Now you are Destro.

1109
01:44:42,674 --> 01:44:44,835
What have you done to me?

1110
01:44:52,450 --> 01:44:57,979
The time has come for the cobra
to rise up and reveal himself.

1111
01:45:00,792 --> 01:45:05,092
You will call me Commander.

1112
01:45:16,708 --> 01:45:19,506
This is Captain Duke Hauser.
Prepare to be boarded.

1113
01:45:21,479 --> 01:45:22,571
Sir.

1114
01:45:25,349 --> 01:45:28,978
You are relentless, Duke.
I'll give you that much.

1115
01:45:30,088 --> 01:45:33,854
And what's to stop me
from blowing you out of the water?

1116
01:45:33,958 --> 01:45:37,325
Self-preservation. I'm taking you in, Rex.

1117
01:45:41,165 --> 01:45:42,996
You and what army?

1118
01:45:44,402 --> 01:45:45,664
My army.

1119
01:46:01,719 --> 01:46:05,177
You know, Duke,
this has only just begun.

1120
01:46:10,995 --> 01:46:12,622
I'll be waiting for you.

1121
01:46:25,076 --> 01:46:27,909
I've never seen encoding like this.
I mean, physically, she's fine,

1122
01:46:28,012 --> 01:46:30,640
but when Rex programmed them,
he sure didn't want them taken out.

1123
01:46:30,748 --> 01:46:33,080
-So there's nothing you can do for her?
-lt'll take some time,

1124
01:46:33,184 --> 01:46:35,084
but we'll take them out.

1125
01:46:40,057 --> 01:46:41,649
Till we get those things
out of your head,

1126
01:46:41,759 --> 01:46:43,818
Iooks like you're gonna be
seeing a lot of me around here.

1127
01:46:43,928 --> 01:46:47,989
You can't save me, Duke.
No one can, not after all I've done.

1128
01:46:48,566 --> 01:46:50,431
Look, that wasn't you.

1129
01:46:53,304 --> 01:46:55,135
I'm not giving up on you.

1130
01:47:29,407 --> 01:47:32,001
-Man, we look good.
-Yeah, well, you better get used to it.

1131
01:47:32,109 --> 01:47:34,873
Heavy Duty thinks you guys
ought to stick around permanently.

1132
01:47:34,979 --> 01:47:36,173
So, you're asking us, right?

1133
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:37,372
Yeah, 'cause he didn't sound
like he was asking.

1134
01:47:37,481 --> 01:47:38,607
'Cause you gotta be asked
to join the G.I. Joes.

1135
01:47:38,716 --> 01:47:40,013
I'm asking.

1136
01:47:40,551 --> 01:47:41,609
Well, I'm in.

1137
01:47:41,719 --> 01:47:45,985
-How do you feel about this?
-I feel very emotional.

1138
01:47:46,891 --> 01:47:50,349
All Joes mobilize and ready check
for Operation Mongoose.

1139
01:47:50,461 --> 01:47:53,726
All ground transports,
rendezvous at Base Brothers Grimm.

1140
01:47:53,831 --> 01:47:56,732
All Howler Hunters will rendezvous
at Base Roman Ruin.

1141
01:47:56,834 --> 01:47:58,392
Good luck, Joes.

1142
01:48:30,368 --> 01:48:32,427
Mr. President, it's good to see you.

1143
01:48:32,536 --> 01:48:34,401
-Thank you. And you.
-It's nice to have you back safely, sir.

1144
01:48:34,505 --> 01:48:36,097
-Thank you. John.
-Welcome back, sir.

1145
01:48:36,207 --> 01:48:39,142
Thank you. Thank you all so much.
