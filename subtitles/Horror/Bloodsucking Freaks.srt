1
00:02:19,903 --> 00:02:22,910
The new shipment has arrived, Master.

2
00:04:09,597 --> 00:04:11,660
Good, good, good...

3
00:04:12,351 --> 00:04:15,675
What a marvelous, wonderful,
attentive audience you are.

4
00:04:15,775 --> 00:04:16,703
And I may I add...

5
00:04:16,876 --> 00:04:18,591
... a brave one too.

6
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:23,475
Now those of you who are weak willed
or coward would have fled by now.

7
00:04:23,516 --> 00:04:25,108
Or regurgitated...

8
00:04:25,785 --> 00:04:27,723
...over the seats in front of you.

9
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:30,621
But why, really?

10
00:04:31,007 --> 00:04:33,296
This is just a theatrical presentation.

11
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,584
A show,

12
00:04:35,434 --> 00:04:39,522
which offers no reality,
not a fraction of reality.

13
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:41,933
And just allows us, you and me...

14
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:45,047
... to tell into our deepest fantasies

15
00:04:45,048 --> 00:04:47,266
far beyond erotica.

16
00:04:50,003 --> 00:04:51,081
I'm...

17
00:04:52,008 --> 00:04:53,676
Sardu

18
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:57,946
Master of the Theater of the Macabre.

19
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,270
Tonight...

20
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,531
... we begin with torture.

21
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,031
Again I warn you...

22
00:05:04,101 --> 00:05:06,090
If should you find what you see...

23
00:05:06,318 --> 00:05:08,677
is a little upsetting to your stomachs...

24
00:05:09,502 --> 00:05:11,868
then just pretend we're play acting.

25
00:05:13,131 --> 00:05:15,729
But if you're skeptical or bored...

26
00:05:16,378 --> 00:05:18,952
then just pretend that what you see...

27
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:21,131
is real.

28
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:36,267
Are you willing to accept Sardu
as your lord and master...

29
00:05:36,268 --> 00:05:38,758
and obey his every whim and command?

30
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:41,464
Listen...

31
00:05:41,517 --> 00:05:43,183
I'll do anything you want.

32
00:05:43,407 --> 00:05:45,507
Oh no, no, no, my dear!

33
00:05:46,266 --> 00:05:47,871
We've just begun.

34
00:05:48,071 --> 00:05:49,761
It's a trick!

35
00:05:50,408 --> 00:05:51,980
Who said that?

36
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:58,618
Ohhh Mr. Maverick,
the famous football player.

37
00:06:00,314 --> 00:06:01,762
Ralphus...

38
00:06:02,568 --> 00:06:05,285
Would you care to try it
on Miss DeNatalie there?

39
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:07,285
The lovely prima ballerina.

40
00:06:07,712 --> 00:06:09,830
Don't you dare!

41
00:06:11,014 --> 00:06:12,146
A trick?

42
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:20,040
What you are about to see now is
the is the 2nd degree of torture.

43
00:06:20,383 --> 00:06:23,187
The iron tourniquet.

44
00:07:00,334 --> 00:07:02,124
She's dead, master.

45
00:07:10,586 --> 00:07:12,628
She is dead.

46
00:07:13,112 --> 00:07:14,562
Tell me, Mr. Maverick...

47
00:07:14,662 --> 00:07:16,266
Why are you applauding?

48
00:07:16,301 --> 00:07:17,920
She is a very good actress.

49
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:21,394
What if I were to tell you
that she is really dead?

50
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:24,038
Actually and eternally?

51
00:07:24,073 --> 00:07:24,982
Trash!

52
00:07:26,104 --> 00:07:28,421
I've seen better, years ago...

53
00:07:28,525 --> 00:07:30,781
in the Grand-Guignol in Paris.

54
00:07:31,344 --> 00:07:35,052
Ahh Mr. Creasy Silo,
the eminent critic.

55
00:07:35,864 --> 00:07:37,511
Not here officially...

56
00:07:37,961 --> 00:07:41,755
I don't review third rate magic shows.

57
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,857
Magic?

58
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:47,263
And let Mr. Silo
explain our next trick...

59
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,492
Dismemberment.

60
00:08:46,331 --> 00:08:50,242
Ohh now we're getting
the proper reaction.

61
00:09:15,392 --> 00:09:18,022
Now the eyes, Ralphus.

62
00:09:42,489 --> 00:09:44,315
Call this a trick?

63
00:09:45,347 --> 00:09:47,066
Not a trick...

64
00:09:48,043 --> 00:09:49,198
Drama.

65
00:09:49,498 --> 00:09:51,901
Pure theater.

66
00:09:55,201 --> 00:09:59,029
The donation for actors, please.
Non of the actors receive any pay.

67
00:10:01,321 --> 00:10:04,276
The donation for actors, please.
Non of the actors receive any pay.

68
00:10:08,081 --> 00:10:10,066
Thank you very much, sir.

69
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,523
A donation for the actors.

70
00:10:12,081 --> 00:10:13,783
Mr. Silo...

71
00:10:14,036 --> 00:10:15,610
A donation for the actors?

72
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:16,748
Actors?

73
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,956
No true actor would submit
to engage in such trash.

74
00:10:22,891 --> 00:10:25,017
But you are going
to review my show.

75
00:10:25,036 --> 00:10:26,571
Absolutely not!

76
00:10:26,832 --> 00:10:28,075
You heard me in there ...

77
00:10:28,335 --> 00:10:32,377
If I were to review your
so-called show even badly,

78
00:10:33,097 --> 00:10:37,129
I feel some of my readers
might come just out of curiosity.

79
00:10:37,566 --> 00:10:40,729
And I do not want to be responsible
for keeping your theater open,

80
00:10:40,948 --> 00:10:42,902
one more day!

81
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,829
Then we shall see.

82
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,418
Really ?

83
00:10:56,234 --> 00:10:57,309
Hey, don't listen to him.

84
00:10:57,528 --> 00:10:59,607
I hate critics and he is
at the top of the list.

85
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:01,820
You know, I really liked your show.

86
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,117
Thank you, Mr. Maverick.

87
00:11:04,336 --> 00:11:06,122
You ought to move it up town.

88
00:11:06,342 --> 00:11:07,333
Ohh well...

89
00:11:07,887 --> 00:11:10,560
And what did Miss DeNatalie
think of our show?

90
00:11:10,935 --> 00:11:14,098
It was just so real.

91
00:11:14,652 --> 00:11:16,061
That girl in the chair...

92
00:11:16,364 --> 00:11:17,523
She was excellent.

93
00:11:17,584 --> 00:11:19,696
She's a fantastic actress.
I'd like to meet her.

94
00:11:20,716 --> 00:11:22,703
Well, perhaps another time.

95
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,626
She got a terrible headache.

96
00:11:26,597 --> 00:11:27,507
Oh, I could imagine!

97
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,125
Good night.

98
00:11:29,237 --> 00:11:30,543
Thank you.

99
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:31,724
Good night.

100
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:36,818
Tom, will you please get me
out of here before I throw up.

101
00:12:59,428 --> 00:13:02,367
Don't you dare ruin my dinner!

102
00:13:35,001 --> 00:13:36,490
How delightful...

103
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:38,739
A little after dinner music.

104
00:13:43,707 --> 00:13:46,404
I want Creasy Silo brought here!

105
00:13:49,498 --> 00:13:52,028
You want us to kidnap him, master?

106
00:13:53,741 --> 00:13:55,173
Yes, Ralphus.

107
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:58,066
I can't do it, it's too dangerous.

108
00:13:58,326 --> 00:13:59,942
I'll get caught!

109
00:14:00,294 --> 00:14:02,817
You must do this for me, Ralphus.

110
00:14:03,368 --> 00:14:06,234
Then what will you do for me, master?

111
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:24,600
You've been a very bad boy today.

112
00:14:24,862 --> 00:14:26,934
Have I really been that bad?

113
00:14:28,944 --> 00:14:30,850
Must I be punished?

114
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:09,495
Now I find this artist makes
a very interesting statement.

115
00:15:10,056 --> 00:15:12,989
I beg your pardon, haven't
I seen you somewhere before?

116
00:15:37,174 --> 00:15:40,347
Welcome to the Theater
of the Macabre, Mr Silo.

117
00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:46,120
I think your appreciation of my art shall
be greatly enhanced in the next few days.

118
00:15:50,461 --> 00:15:51,786
I don't believe it!

119
00:15:52,171 --> 00:15:56,076
I don't believe it, Sardu.

120
00:15:57,169 --> 00:16:02,522
Thinking of all these is so trite
and kidnapping, so classical.

121
00:16:05,042 --> 00:16:08,728
The eminent critic has a
sense of humor in times of stress.

122
00:16:09,748 --> 00:16:12,478
But it won't suffice for
what is to follow, my friend.

123
00:16:13,122 --> 00:16:16,402
Unless of course you agree
that my theater is true art

124
00:16:16,621 --> 00:16:19,611
and you apologise to me
in the most sincere way.

125
00:16:20,895 --> 00:16:22,209
Or...?

126
00:16:23,828 --> 00:16:25,250
Torture.

127
00:16:29,243 --> 00:16:31,024
This will never work, Sardu.

128
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:35,116
Allow me to show you.

129
00:16:39,781 --> 00:16:44,239
No. No.

130
00:17:01,299 --> 00:17:05,263
A most modern method
of reflex orientation.

131
00:17:06,399 --> 00:17:11,579
Ralphus will now induce
500 volts to her nervous system.

132
00:17:41,695 --> 00:17:44,425
If she does as she
is told, there is no pain,

133
00:17:44,525 --> 00:17:45,367
if not...

134
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,819
excruciating agony.

135
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,640
She will soon learn, the only
thing to alleviate her discomfort ...

136
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,027
is her utterly correct
responses to my commands

137
00:17:56,127 --> 00:17:59,043
and the sound of this whistle.

138
00:18:11,997 --> 00:18:13,528
No. ..

139
00:18:34,568 --> 00:18:35,723
Master!

140
00:18:36,284 --> 00:18:38,607
Please don't hurt me any more!

141
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:40,608
Master !

142
00:18:43,924 --> 00:18:45,481
I know, my dear.

143
00:18:46,449 --> 00:18:50,136
We will soon find many
exciting things for you to do.

144
00:18:51,281 --> 00:18:54,028
And in time you'll
learn to enjoy them.

145
00:18:58,215 --> 00:18:59,402
Gidee Up!

146
00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:02,717
So Creasy...

147
00:19:02,946 --> 00:19:08,010
look on in awe at a man who has
turned all his fantasies into reality.

148
00:19:08,636 --> 00:19:09,509
Not really.

149
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,885
One still escapes you ...

150
00:19:11,903 --> 00:19:14,175
Success in the theater.

151
00:19:15,152 --> 00:19:16,848
That is about to occur.

152
00:19:17,067 --> 00:19:20,405
My new show
received critical acclaim.

153
00:19:20,525 --> 00:19:23,890
You haven't the talent to
create anything but garbage.

154
00:19:24,899 --> 00:19:27,431
A ballet is forming in my mind.

155
00:19:27,983 --> 00:19:30,545
It will combine 2 art forms...

156
00:19:30,773 --> 00:19:33,388
Sadism and dance.

157
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,963
Cos the public cannot
digest eroticism alone.

158
00:19:37,564 --> 00:19:41,500
But to display sadism and
discipline in its purest form

159
00:19:41,629 --> 00:19:43,717
would on lead to imprisonment.

160
00:19:44,545 --> 00:19:49,177
But by simply disguising
it with a story, a minimal plot

161
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,551
and a score...

162
00:19:51,311 --> 00:19:56,309
will result in my being
hailed as a creative genius.

163
00:19:56,344 --> 00:19:57,174
Kill me!

164
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,724
Kill me!

165
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:01,530
Oh no, my friend.

166
00:20:02,391 --> 00:20:06,161
You're going to be front
row, centre in my triumph.

167
00:20:06,557 --> 00:20:07,578
After all...

168
00:20:08,973 --> 00:20:11,922
what good is the show
without a critic?

169
00:20:19,072 --> 00:20:21,077
Have you finished your ride, Ralphus?

170
00:20:21,396 --> 00:20:23,168
Put her to work in the toilet.

171
00:20:28,512 --> 00:20:31,378
Her mouth will make
an interesting urinal.

172
00:20:39,534 --> 00:20:44,856
At last I'm glad to see some of the petro
dollars flowing back in this direction.

173
00:20:54,072 --> 00:20:57,470
I can't say I'm not doing
my bit for the economy.

174
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:04,251
One million.

175
00:21:16,243 --> 00:21:18,613
Whoa, there's no need to count it.

176
00:21:18,648 --> 00:21:21,808
Your employer is an old customer.

177
00:21:21,843 --> 00:21:24,882
He is very pleased with
the quality of the shipment.

178
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:29,813
They have done much to maintain
peace in my area of the world.

179
00:21:30,241 --> 00:21:34,351
You tell Henry that
he is a very fine gentleman.

180
00:21:34,386 --> 00:21:36,424
And a very good customer.

181
00:21:37,105 --> 00:21:38,911
Will I be seeing him shortly?

182
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,031
No, not likely.

183
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:44,542
At this moment, he is
flying back to the Middle east.

184
00:21:44,577 --> 00:21:48,918
To be on hand to supervise
the reception of the shipment.

185
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,733
Personally!

186
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:55,500
If that is agreeable
with everybody concerned.

187
00:22:29,022 --> 00:22:31,856
Go away!
Go away!

188
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:34,971
Filthy bitches!

189
00:22:35,006 --> 00:22:36,003
Get back!

190
00:22:36,952 --> 00:22:39,598
Get back!
Away, bitches!

191
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:40,585
Get back!

192
00:22:42,693 --> 00:22:43,840
Stay back!

193
00:22:54,153 --> 00:22:54,791
Stay back!

194
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:02,356
Sluts!

195
00:23:04,812 --> 00:23:06,351
Are you hurt, master?

196
00:23:06,471 --> 00:23:08,099
It's just a scratch.

197
00:23:08,806 --> 00:23:10,269
Still untrainable!

198
00:23:10,892 --> 00:23:14,087
Still refuse to accept
me as your master, eh?

199
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,510
Ralphus.

200
00:23:18,545 --> 00:23:19,509
Master?

201
00:23:20,615 --> 00:23:22,356
Starve them to bed.

202
00:23:25,412 --> 00:23:26,986
A dinner by candlelight?

203
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:28,447
How romantic!

204
00:23:32,129 --> 00:23:33,454
How's the fillet?

205
00:23:34,591 --> 00:23:35,713
Tender?

206
00:23:36,787 --> 00:23:40,004
You are eating one of my
trainees that didn't quite work out.

207
00:23:42,977 --> 00:23:45,346
You mean I didn't spoil your appetite?

208
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:49,392
Nothing you can say
or do will revolt me.

209
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:51,854
My next show will.

210
00:23:55,661 --> 00:23:57,026
Your shows ...

211
00:23:57,246 --> 00:23:58,321
would revolt...

212
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,992
anyone.

213
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,353
It will be built around ballet.

214
00:24:06,717 --> 00:24:10,462
You haven't the talent
to stage a proper ballet.

215
00:24:11,165 --> 00:24:14,032
It will star Natasha DeNatalie.

216
00:24:19,777 --> 00:24:22,037
She'll never dance for you.

217
00:24:22,907 --> 00:24:24,566
Not willingly.

218
00:24:25,994 --> 00:24:27,265
Yes, master?

219
00:24:27,786 --> 00:24:29,060
Ralphus.

220
00:24:29,248 --> 00:24:33,527
Be a little chap and run along and
collect Natasha DeNatalie for me.

221
00:24:40,222 --> 00:24:41,003
Tom ..

222
00:24:41,221 --> 00:24:43,381
you do everything just so well...

223
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,177
even make love.

224
00:24:45,921 --> 00:24:49,390
Well, no matter what I do, nothing
compares to you on the stage, beautiful.

225
00:24:49,984 --> 00:24:52,283
You make Lincoln Center just come alive.

226
00:24:55,699 --> 00:24:57,601
I have to get to work, though.

227
00:25:00,915 --> 00:25:02,591
Estonian ballerinas...

228
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:04,474
- Tom.
- Hmm.

229
00:25:04,778 --> 00:25:07,805
Do you find me attractive
as a star of the ballet...

230
00:25:07,967 --> 00:25:09,293
or as a person?

231
00:25:09,411 --> 00:25:10,285
Both.

232
00:25:10,304 --> 00:25:13,006
Oh, come on, I think
you just like dancing.

233
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:15,208
Not when they look like you, I do.

234
00:25:17,245 --> 00:25:18,419
Natasha

235
00:25:23,071 --> 00:25:25,247
I'll be late for rehearsal.

236
00:25:25,782 --> 00:25:26,804
One cup of coffee?

237
00:25:27,034 --> 00:25:28,025
No.

238
00:25:29,412 --> 00:25:30,987
Will I see you tonight?

239
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:32,574
Well ..

240
00:25:32,834 --> 00:25:34,451
after the performance.

241
00:25:46,394 --> 00:25:47,416
You know, Tom ..

242
00:25:50,189 --> 00:25:52,224
if I had time...

243
00:25:53,738 --> 00:25:57,514
you would be the only person
I would spend it with in this world.

244
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:08,535
Welcome.

245
00:27:08,754 --> 00:27:12,490
So, you've decided to leave Lincoln
Center and come to dance with me?

246
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,521
Do you like?

247
00:27:37,835 --> 00:27:40,317
I like very much, master.

248
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,572
Then do what you please with her,

249
00:27:42,591 --> 00:27:44,709
only don't incapacitate her.

250
00:27:45,261 --> 00:27:47,211
She must dance for me.

251
00:27:53,961 --> 00:27:55,520
Ralphus!

252
00:27:56,069 --> 00:27:58,103
No marks on her body!

253
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,270
Who is this?

254
00:28:31,657 --> 00:28:33,191
Natasha? No, she is not here.

255
00:28:34,036 --> 00:28:35,194
She did what?

256
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:37,197
She didn't come to the theater?

257
00:28:40,295 --> 00:28:41,786
How long has she been missing?

258
00:28:45,968 --> 00:28:47,961
Jesus Christ!

259
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:52,634
Why didn't you call me earlier?

260
00:28:57,735 --> 00:29:01,487
Natasha DeNatalie has joined my company.

261
00:29:05,955 --> 00:29:08,489
Her absence will not be taken lightly.

262
00:29:09,375 --> 00:29:10,824
The Police will track her here.

263
00:29:11,043 --> 00:29:13,162
They haven't tracked anyone here yet.

264
00:29:13,589 --> 00:29:15,456
I've been in business for years.

265
00:29:15,674 --> 00:29:18,575
DeNatalie is a celebrity.

266
00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:24,995
Public opinion will force them...

267
00:29:27,316 --> 00:29:28,841
to come here.

268
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,092
It's nothing...

269
00:29:31,448 --> 00:29:33,199
have it your missing high schoolgirls...

270
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,972
whose feat is of...

271
00:29:35,201 --> 00:29:38,395
no interest, not even parents.

272
00:30:15,882 --> 00:30:17,947
Now, will you dance for me?

273
00:30:22,641 --> 00:30:23,848
Continue.

274
00:30:49,927 --> 00:30:52,036
She is stronger than we thought.

275
00:30:52,473 --> 00:30:57,194
24 hours without sleep, warmth,
and comfort and she still denies me.

276
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,672
Really, I quite admire her courage.

277
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:03,727
It's really quite a challenge.

278
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,785
<i> This is the New York Police
Department emergency number 911.</i>

279
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:27,312
<i> There is no one in at the moment.
You are listening to a recording.</i>

280
00:31:27,331 --> 00:31:30,078
<i>At the sound of the beep,
leave your name, telephone number,</i>

281
00:31:30,109 --> 00:31:34,185
<i>a short description of the crime
and their perpetrators.</i>

282
00:31:47,681 --> 00:31:49,655
Is she dead, master?

283
00:31:51,849 --> 00:31:53,122
Not quite.

284
00:31:55,356 --> 00:31:57,561
If she dies no new show.

285
00:31:57,989 --> 00:31:59,315
I know, idiots.

286
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,822
And all our work will have been in vain.

287
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,831
Call the doctor.

288
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,274
Will she live, doctor?

289
00:32:54,298 --> 00:32:55,572
I've given Ralphus a prescription.

290
00:32:57,597 --> 00:32:59,089
How much do I owe you?

291
00:32:59,688 --> 00:33:02,884
My malpractice insurance is going up.

292
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:06,484
How about taking it out on trade?

293
00:33:07,906 --> 00:33:09,701
Another operation?

294
00:33:10,964 --> 00:33:12,042
What kind?

295
00:33:12,723 --> 00:33:15,882
Ooh, you make it up.

296
00:33:27,322 --> 00:33:29,057
This won't hurt a bit.

297
00:33:29,886 --> 00:33:31,339
Pretty patient.

298
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,341
No. ..

299
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:33,793
Now...

300
00:33:34,943 --> 00:33:36,895
I like coming to Sardu's...

301
00:33:37,407 --> 00:33:41,866
'cos he lets me do anything
I want to, to the patients.

302
00:33:42,552 --> 00:33:43,943
Understand ?

303
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:52,935
Hi, aren't we going to
have a pretty operation.

304
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:56,487
I don't have many...

305
00:33:56,998 --> 00:33:58,532
pretty patients...

306
00:34:00,196 --> 00:34:02,309
because I get into a lot of trouble...

307
00:34:02,328 --> 00:34:04,130
and my mother doesn't like it.

308
00:34:05,962 --> 00:34:07,555
I live with my mother.

309
00:34:08,026 --> 00:34:11,058
Please.
Please don't hurt me.

310
00:34:11,093 --> 00:34:12,484
I'm not going to hurt you.

311
00:34:12,912 --> 00:34:15,225
I'm a doctor.
I'm going to cure you.

312
00:34:15,836 --> 00:34:17,415
Of everything.

313
00:34:20,557 --> 00:34:23,302
Please. Please
I'll do anything.

314
00:34:23,849 --> 00:34:24,932
You will?

315
00:34:29,287 --> 00:34:32,535
Can you do something with your mouth?

316
00:34:33,223 --> 00:34:35,041
I love mouths.

317
00:34:35,663 --> 00:34:37,337
I should have been a dentist.

318
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:38,926
But...

319
00:34:39,855 --> 00:34:43,355
My mother said that a
doctor is much classier.

320
00:34:45,069 --> 00:34:46,361
You won't bite?

321
00:34:48,436 --> 00:34:50,540
Okay, open wide.

322
00:34:51,753 --> 00:34:53,504
You sure you won't bite?

323
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,590
Let's make sure you won't bite.

324
00:35:10,683 --> 00:35:12,594
That's it...

325
00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:24,331
Now...

326
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,445
When I was in school...

327
00:35:26,466 --> 00:35:28,635
they used to say that...

328
00:35:29,987 --> 00:35:33,255
I couldn't do that.

329
00:35:45,546 --> 00:35:46,622
Now...

330
00:35:46,641 --> 00:35:48,677
you can't bite.

331
00:35:59,933 --> 00:36:01,175
Doctor?

332
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,212
Well, you're not going
to do her hair, are you?

333
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:16,823
No.

334
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:21,394
A little bit of a
elective neurosurgery.

335
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:44,363
I was just going to see
the doctor out, master?

336
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,203
What did you say?

337
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:54,860
I was just going to see
the doctor out, master.

338
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:55,929
Doctor!

339
00:39:58,192 --> 00:39:59,215
Get rid of him!

340
00:40:00,071 --> 00:40:01,148
Yes, master.

341
00:40:03,622 --> 00:40:04,988
Permanently.

342
00:40:18,675 --> 00:40:22,093
Would it be easier to
get a taxi out of Broadway?

343
00:40:22,312 --> 00:40:24,315
No, it's quicker this way.
You'll like it.

344
00:40:28,834 --> 00:40:29,993
Right here!

345
00:40:30,213 --> 00:40:32,580
... my office in a cab.
I'm not trying to wait for the subway!

346
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:33,949
This is faster.

347
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:36,384
Come on.
Right this way.

348
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:41,607
Okay, I ... thank you.
Say goodbye to Sardu.

349
00:42:48,178 --> 00:42:50,188
Bulls eye, coming up.

350
00:44:22,229 --> 00:44:23,013
Who is it?

351
00:44:23,232 --> 00:44:25,732
Sergeant Tucci,
New York City Police Department.

352
00:44:27,071 --> 00:44:28,021
Come on in.

353
00:44:29,078 --> 00:44:30,923
You left a message on
our service, Mr Maverick.

354
00:44:30,924 --> 00:44:32,024
Right, right.

355
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,115
How about a drink?

356
00:44:34,335 --> 00:44:35,952
No, I haven't got the time.

357
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:38,580
Got another case uptown.

358
00:44:38,841 --> 00:44:41,164
- Listen, have you got any leads for...
- Fine place you got here!

359
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,283
No wonder.

360
00:44:44,222 --> 00:44:46,839
That was some contract you just signed.

361
00:44:47,725 --> 00:44:50,510
I mean, keeping the chips
for the rest of your life.

362
00:44:51,869 --> 00:44:53,438
And those hairspray commercials,

363
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:57,110
- really something!
- The DeNatalie case...

364
00:44:57,527 --> 00:44:58,896
Do you have any leads?

365
00:45:01,684 --> 00:45:03,275
Only you, QP.

366
00:45:03,494 --> 00:45:04,276
Me?

367
00:45:06,162 --> 00:45:06,987
You!

368
00:45:08,833 --> 00:45:10,158
I don't understand.

369
00:45:10,377 --> 00:45:11,968
Huh, you were sleeping with her.

370
00:45:12,655 --> 00:45:14,139
You could have got into
an argument or something?

371
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:15,540
Hey, come on.

372
00:45:16,299 --> 00:45:17,750
Don't worry about it.

373
00:45:18,645 --> 00:45:22,004
A little money upfront and I
can prove that the mayor did it.

374
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:24,484
This rotten town.

375
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:26,741
What did you expect?

376
00:45:27,897 --> 00:45:30,639
My father worked for 25 years, for what?

377
00:45:31,239 --> 00:45:32,132
<i> Niente</i>

378
00:45:33,155 --> 00:45:35,271
He didn't live to see his pension.

379
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:37,188
Now, was he was an honest cop, too?

380
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:39,357
He was a clerk in the
Department of Commerce.

381
00:45:39,376 --> 00:45:41,494
When are you going to find Natasha?

382
00:45:41,678 --> 00:45:43,696
How much is it worth to you?

383
00:45:44,291 --> 00:45:45,240
Worth to me?

384
00:45:45,443 --> 00:45:47,827
Well, you son of a bitch.
She is a citizen, man.

385
00:45:47,947 --> 00:45:48,953
Take it easy...

386
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:52,082
I know she is a citizen.

387
00:45:52,101 --> 00:45:53,466
So she's a citizen...

388
00:45:54,312 --> 00:45:56,759
Saw her pictures in a file at
the Missing Persons Bureau.

389
00:45:56,819 --> 00:45:58,543
They mail it to 50 police departments.

390
00:46:00,163 --> 00:46:01,947
Nobody is going to
bother looking for her.

391
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,605
She will show up...

392
00:46:05,323 --> 00:46:06,898
dead, if she's lucky.

393
00:46:07,826 --> 00:46:09,486
You want to be smart, QP?

394
00:46:10,247 --> 00:46:12,645
Take some of this money you have...

395
00:46:13,002 --> 00:46:15,201
and grease the hands of justice.

396
00:46:15,462 --> 00:46:17,244
Make that, the wheels of justice.

397
00:46:21,551 --> 00:46:22,625
Alright.

398
00:46:23,303 --> 00:46:24,461
How much?

399
00:46:26,682 --> 00:46:27,786
Ten grand.

400
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:36,400
Well, how is our little patient today?

401
00:46:37,101 --> 00:46:38,596
I won't dance.

402
00:46:39,448 --> 00:46:40,888
Enough of that!

403
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:45,434
Time to recoup your energy.

404
00:46:46,322 --> 00:46:49,190
Ralphus has made
some chicken soup for you.

405
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:55,696
There...
He made it especially for you.

406
00:46:59,212 --> 00:47:00,400
Delicious?

407
00:47:02,133 --> 00:47:03,749
My mother taught me...

408
00:47:03,968 --> 00:47:06,667
I used the whole chicken.

409
00:47:07,054 --> 00:47:09,522
The secret is cooking it alive.

410
00:47:19,137 --> 00:47:21,978
We have a little entertainment
planned for you today...

411
00:47:22,905 --> 00:47:24,648
some thing that may happen to you...

412
00:47:24,867 --> 00:47:27,485
if you still insist on not dancing.

413
00:47:29,372 --> 00:47:30,238
Lights!

414
00:47:31,566 --> 00:47:32,855
The rack.

415
00:47:33,876 --> 00:47:35,703
A legitimate form of punishment,

416
00:47:35,922 --> 00:47:39,373
legalized by both the
Church and the State.

417
00:47:42,138 --> 00:47:43,243
Action!

418
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:21,130
This is going to go far beyond
every stretch of your imagination.

419
00:48:51,426 --> 00:48:53,125
Slowly, girls!

420
00:48:53,244 --> 00:48:54,418
Slowly!

421
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:47,923
- QP?
- Yeah.

422
00:49:48,158 --> 00:49:49,149
Sergeant Tucci.

423
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:52,444
I finally figured out what happened
to your girlfriend Natasha.

424
00:49:53,064 --> 00:49:53,878
What?

425
00:49:53,797 --> 00:49:56,951
The Times critic Creasy Silo,
disappeared last week, right?

426
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:57,901
Right.

427
00:49:58,030 --> 00:49:59,578
Yeah, they ran off together.

428
00:50:00,256 --> 00:50:01,413
Bullshit!

429
00:50:01,433 --> 00:50:03,291
Extremely plausible.

430
00:50:03,361 --> 00:50:05,793
Tucci, I want my money back.

431
00:50:06,221 --> 00:50:08,672
It's only a theory, QP.

432
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:09,764
Listen...

433
00:50:09,975 --> 00:50:11,215
I'm working on it.

434
00:50:11,434 --> 00:50:12,969
Yeah, well, you better be.

435
00:50:27,496 --> 00:50:29,978
Our second
demonstration, my dear.

436
00:50:30,499 --> 00:50:34,993
Add punishment for little girl who
refuses to take her dancing lesson.

437
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:46,175
Due to her tender age,
we're being most gentle with her.

438
00:50:47,812 --> 00:50:49,135
Help me!

439
00:51:00,075 --> 00:51:01,985
Now, as long as
you do as we tell you ...

440
00:51:02,204 --> 00:51:04,153
the longer you'll stay alive.

441
00:51:23,311 --> 00:51:27,472
Open your mouth, I'm going
to put something nice into it.

442
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:30,685
Good!

443
00:51:30,904 --> 00:51:33,020
Bite down hard.
Don't let go.

444
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:36,066
You may lose your head.

445
00:51:36,618 --> 00:51:40,502
Now, let's see how long you can
go before you open your mouth.

446
00:51:46,412 --> 00:51:48,245
Why, I almost forgot...

447
00:51:51,136 --> 00:51:55,379
We're going to cane you for
being a very bad little girl.

448
00:52:01,773 --> 00:52:03,431
Help me!

449
00:53:35,339 --> 00:53:39,168
How many times do I have to tell you,
you're white and I'm brown, idiot!

450
00:53:40,262 --> 00:53:42,588
How much we play for, Master?

451
00:53:44,099 --> 00:53:46,735
Well, let's start off
with the finger in the pot.

452
00:54:49,284 --> 00:54:51,501
You don't have any more chips, master.

453
00:54:52,178 --> 00:54:54,338
Why is it you always win?

454
00:54:55,641 --> 00:54:56,550
Play on!

455
00:54:56,653 --> 00:54:59,136
But you don't have
any more chips, master.

456
00:55:03,107 --> 00:55:05,560
I bet you an arm and a leg, I do.

457
00:55:13,746 --> 00:55:15,944
What's this about a hunger strike?

458
00:55:18,044 --> 00:55:20,160
Well, I won't have it.

459
00:55:19,979 --> 00:55:22,995
You're as much a part
of the scene as Natasha.

460
00:55:23,218 --> 00:55:24,312
Ralphus.

461
00:55:25,452 --> 00:55:27,102
Force feed him.

462
00:55:59,916 --> 00:56:02,250
Allow me to introduce to you...

463
00:56:02,269 --> 00:56:03,710
your rival...

464
00:56:05,439 --> 00:56:06,463
Maya.

465
00:56:14,133 --> 00:56:15,663
Natasha!

466
00:56:16,912 --> 00:56:19,562
She will not dance for you either.

467
00:56:19,681 --> 00:56:20,886
Oh, yes, she will ...

468
00:56:21,116 --> 00:56:24,067
but she'll do a dance
of a different kind.

469
00:56:24,703 --> 00:56:27,864
I shall now demonstrate to
you what shall happen to you...

470
00:56:28,083 --> 00:56:31,117
if you do not immediately
agree to start rehearsal.

471
00:57:07,804 --> 00:57:12,440
I think your colleague has
hung up her dancing shoes forever.

472
00:57:22,905 --> 00:57:26,931
Now are you planning to
cut short your dancing career?

473
00:57:27,342 --> 00:57:29,243
I will dance!

474
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,396
Oooh, she will dance.

475
00:57:33,809 --> 00:57:35,650
She will dance.

476
00:57:49,444 --> 00:57:51,133
Theater Macabre.

477
00:57:52,732 --> 00:57:55,831
Nope. Master Sardu
can't come to the phone.

478
00:57:57,628 --> 00:57:59,638
He's tied up for the moment.

479
00:58:25,746 --> 00:58:27,920
She shall dance.

480
00:58:31,567 --> 00:58:33,484
You were wrong, Creasy.

481
00:58:34,938 --> 00:58:36,906
She shall dance for me.

482
00:58:39,495 --> 00:58:41,309
Have some champagne.

483
00:58:56,738 --> 00:58:57,827
That's enough.

484
00:59:00,778 --> 00:59:03,628
"Ballerina Flips Lid For Freak Show"

485
00:59:04,564 --> 00:59:06,924
Your little girlfriend didn't disappear.

486
00:59:07,143 --> 00:59:08,635
She just went off Broadway.

487
00:59:08,978 --> 00:59:11,104
- Right here in Variety.
- Give me that.

488
00:59:13,308 --> 00:59:15,042
Christ, I don't believe it...

489
00:59:16,204 --> 00:59:17,676
You know broads...

490
00:59:17,705 --> 00:59:18,917
Come on.

491
00:59:18,918 --> 00:59:22,102
She wouldn't give up Lincoln Center
for that rat hole in Soho!

492
00:59:22,276 --> 00:59:25,153
Ooh, they kidnapped her
and tortured her.

493
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:26,639
Wise up!

494
00:59:26,858 --> 00:59:28,806
But she's not
appearing willingly.

495
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:31,602
Yeah.
Hey!

496
00:59:32,431 --> 00:59:34,964
What kind of show
does this guy Sardu put on?

497
00:59:35,976 --> 00:59:37,133
Ahh, nude ones.

498
00:59:39,105 --> 00:59:41,704
I wonder how much he's paying off ...

499
00:59:42,317 --> 00:59:44,240
I got to talk to her.

500
01:00:08,622 --> 01:00:10,957
Careful, Ralphus.
Careful.

501
01:00:11,076 --> 01:00:13,557
We want him to look
his best for opening night.

502
01:00:14,426 --> 01:00:16,996
No, no.

503
01:00:17,734 --> 01:00:21,018
You wouldn't dare
allow me appear in public.

504
01:00:21,405 --> 01:00:22,979
Oh, yes, I would.

505
01:00:24,741 --> 01:00:28,360
And you're going to have
the best seat in the house.

506
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:49,542
Ok girls, take ten.

507
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:53,431
Well, Ralphus, what
do you think so far?

508
01:00:54,393 --> 01:00:56,610
Nah! It's too long, master.

509
01:00:56,629 --> 01:00:57,777
Too long?

510
01:00:57,905 --> 01:01:00,287
Then why didn't you cut
out the last Inquisition joke

511
01:01:00,288 --> 01:01:02,547
and make your exit on the Gestapo.

512
01:01:02,582 --> 01:01:03,590
Ralphus!

513
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:07,406
- Master?
- Yes.

514
01:01:07,441 --> 01:01:11,005
- About my billing?
- Don't talk to me about billing!

515
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:14,443
I thought you gave that all up when
you left the William Morris Agency!

516
01:01:17,427 --> 01:01:18,668
Actors...

517
01:01:21,041 --> 01:01:23,539
Master will be with you in a moment.

518
01:01:23,569 --> 01:01:26,683
He's on the telephone
with his press agent.

519
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:35,489
It's some witty place.

520
01:01:39,669 --> 01:01:41,177
You know something, QP?

521
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,865
There is more in here than meets the eye.

522
01:01:44,134 --> 01:01:45,083
Yeah what?

523
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:47,337
I smell money.

524
01:01:49,515 --> 01:01:52,987
I always thought these
Off-Off Broadway gimmicks

525
01:01:52,988 --> 01:01:54,824
were front for something else.

526
01:01:55,355 --> 01:01:56,513
So for what?

527
01:01:57,149 --> 01:01:58,373
I don't know.

528
01:01:58,567 --> 01:01:59,756
Something big.

529
01:02:03,988 --> 01:02:05,276
Mr. Maverick.

530
01:02:07,452 --> 01:02:10,008
Well, it's certainly
nice seeing you again.

531
01:02:10,043 --> 01:02:10,447
Either way.

532
01:02:10,666 --> 01:02:11,655
John Tucci.

533
01:02:12,375 --> 01:02:15,309
Sergeant John Tucci,
New York City Police Department.

534
01:02:15,328 --> 01:02:16,376
Really?

535
01:02:18,174 --> 01:02:20,333
You are both coming
to our opening tonight.

536
01:02:21,010 --> 01:02:22,461
Listen...

537
01:02:22,888 --> 01:02:24,275
I'd like to see Natasha.

538
01:02:24,304 --> 01:02:27,187
Oh I'm afraid not.
She's exhausted.

539
01:02:27,217 --> 01:02:29,366
Rehearsal after rehearsal.

540
01:02:29,812 --> 01:02:32,020
You know what a perfectionist she is!

541
01:02:32,021 --> 01:02:34,057
Ya, I know all about that.
I just want to see her, alright.

542
01:02:34,176 --> 01:02:34,816
Why?

543
01:02:35,694 --> 01:02:39,362
I mean, we're all going to Sardis
aren't we, afterwards, to celebrate.

544
01:02:39,448 --> 01:02:41,742
I said I wanted to see her.

545
01:02:42,294 --> 01:02:44,497
Well, absolutely not.

546
01:02:44,789 --> 01:02:46,378
This is the theater.

547
01:02:46,497 --> 01:02:48,665
You know what an opening is like?

548
01:02:48,917 --> 01:02:52,743
In fact I can hardly afford to spend
these few moments talking to you.

549
01:02:53,798 --> 01:02:56,290
Produce the lady, Sardu.

550
01:02:56,719 --> 01:02:57,742
Please...

551
01:02:58,764 --> 01:03:02,004
Produce the lady
or produce your license.

552
01:03:02,139 --> 01:03:03,178
<i>Capish.</i>

553
01:03:03,851 --> 01:03:05,927
If she's not here in five minutes...

554
01:03:06,939 --> 01:03:09,573
there's going to be so many
violations against this place...

555
01:03:10,051 --> 01:03:13,123
that you won't be able to
open a can of beer tonight.

556
01:03:15,323 --> 01:03:16,814
If you insist...

557
01:03:18,578 --> 01:03:19,850
I insist!

558
01:03:21,706 --> 01:03:22,781
Very well.

559
01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:26,609
But don't take up
too much of her time.

560
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:32,828
Hey there, you got a nice
way of getting things done.

561
01:03:32,843 --> 01:03:34,677
It's called tact.

562
01:03:39,711 --> 01:03:40,968
Hi, Tom!

563
01:03:44,466 --> 01:03:46,732
I'm sorry I didn't called you, Tom.

564
01:03:46,752 --> 01:03:50,337
But I've just been so
tied up with my new show.

565
01:03:50,781 --> 01:03:52,230
Were you here willingly?

566
01:03:52,449 --> 01:03:53,723
Of course!

567
01:03:54,618 --> 01:03:58,154
I mean, Lincoln Center
it is just so boring.

568
01:03:58,415 --> 01:04:02,408
You know, one night Giselle act or the
other, that would be the only thing that

569
01:04:02,527 --> 01:04:05,654
I would have to look forward to.

570
01:04:06,091 --> 01:04:07,582
Believe me...

571
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:10,819
Sardu is a genius.

572
01:04:11,747 --> 01:04:14,024
This is where it's all at...

573
01:04:14,143 --> 01:04:16,251
right here in Soho.

574
01:04:16,745 --> 01:04:18,677
Yeah, but this is a S & M show.

575
01:04:19,330 --> 01:04:20,805
It's not S & M.

576
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:23,176
This is art!

577
01:04:23,819 --> 01:04:24,520
And ..

578
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:28,171
please, will you come
to the show tonight.

579
01:04:28,367 --> 01:04:31,980
And now Ralphus will show
both of you gentlemen out.

580
01:04:32,015 --> 01:04:33,583
Don't bother, Sardu.

581
01:04:34,374 --> 01:04:36,291
We'll find our own way out.

582
01:04:37,145 --> 01:04:37,826
Come on, Tom

583
01:05:00,738 --> 01:05:04,586
Master...

584
01:05:05,779 --> 01:05:06,819
Master...

585
01:05:09,074 --> 01:05:09,926
Master!

586
01:05:11,417 --> 01:05:14,919
Oh, Master, please
don't punish me, Master.

587
01:05:16,614 --> 01:05:17,658
Master.

588
01:05:21,985 --> 01:05:23,507
Master..

589
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:36,335
You did very well, Natasha.

590
01:05:37,948 --> 01:05:40,352
Thank you, master.

591
01:05:44,288 --> 01:05:46,816
Thank you, master.

592
01:05:56,495 --> 01:05:58,786
I don't know what the hell
is the matter with her.

593
01:05:59,214 --> 01:06:00,914
I thought I know her like a book.

594
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,352
Something doesn't smell right in that place.

595
01:06:03,678 --> 01:06:04,882
Maybe she's right.

596
01:06:04,911 --> 01:06:07,271
Sex and sadism might be
the new thing, I don't know...

597
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:10,618
She was trying to tell you
something QP, and you missed it.

598
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:12,151
Like what?

599
01:06:13,213 --> 01:06:16,868
- She never danced Giselle...
- I know, how do you know?

600
01:06:17,011 --> 01:06:18,793
I am a freak for anything in a tutu.

601
01:06:18,812 --> 01:06:20,602
- You?
- Uh, uh.

602
01:06:20,637 --> 01:06:22,792
When I was a kid,
I wanted to become a dancer.

603
01:06:23,142 --> 01:06:24,759
But I come from an Italian family...

604
01:06:24,978 --> 01:06:26,971
My father wanted me to do
something honorable...

605
01:06:27,564 --> 01:06:29,055
so I became an honest cop.

606
01:06:30,191 --> 01:06:32,317
But I want to get this guy, Sardu.

607
01:06:33,054 --> 01:06:34,145
My way.

608
01:06:38,075 --> 01:06:39,717
What are you doing back here?

609
01:06:39,836 --> 01:06:42,193
I have a show opening
in less than 2 hours.

610
01:06:42,228 --> 01:06:43,613
Business, Sardu.

611
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:46,176
Business?

612
01:06:47,462 --> 01:06:48,968
Monkey business.

613
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:51,193
I don't understand.

614
01:06:51,226 --> 01:06:52,416
Understand this!

615
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:56,978
Ralphus...

616
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,039
Shut up!

617
01:06:58,891 --> 01:07:02,177
You kill a cop in this town and
you're as good as dead, Sardu.

618
01:07:02,625 --> 01:07:03,827
<i>Capish</i>

619
01:07:04,648 --> 01:07:07,048
And you have a record
a mile long, downtown.

620
01:07:08,655 --> 01:07:10,561
Three open murder charges.

621
01:07:11,365 --> 01:07:12,189
Now ...

622
01:07:12,866 --> 01:07:14,766
where's this place, the front door?

623
01:07:16,939 --> 01:07:18,863
I'll cut you in.

624
01:07:19,082 --> 01:07:21,065
Of course you'll cut me in.

625
01:07:21,276 --> 01:07:23,035
But what's going on here, Sardu?

626
01:07:24,087 --> 01:07:25,512
White slavery.

627
01:07:26,731 --> 01:07:27,973
White slavery!

628
01:07:28,885 --> 01:07:30,686
You were keeping years ago.

629
01:07:31,723 --> 01:07:33,903
My show must open tonight.

630
01:07:33,938 --> 01:07:36,717
How much you willing to pay
for your show to open tonight?

631
01:07:39,606 --> 01:07:41,473
I'll give you $50,000.

632
01:07:42,319 --> 01:07:44,350
$50,000?

633
01:07:47,032 --> 01:07:49,348
You making that money off these broads?

634
01:07:50,744 --> 01:07:53,788
I do volume business.
I ship all over the world.

635
01:07:54,375 --> 01:07:55,799
International, huh?

636
01:07:56,668 --> 01:07:59,201
Well, I guess then we'll
have to up the ante, Sardu.

637
01:08:00,339 --> 01:08:01,987
A 100, 000.

638
01:08:03,176 --> 01:08:05,794
Alright, I accept
your proposition, Tucci.

639
01:08:06,221 --> 01:08:06,959
Good.

640
01:08:07,597 --> 01:08:08,504
Tonight.

641
01:08:10,266 --> 01:08:11,991
I can't get my hands on that much...

642
01:08:12,011 --> 01:08:14,577
Well, you better get your
hands on that much cash.

643
01:08:15,146 --> 01:08:17,097
Now you don't keep
any money in the banks.

644
01:08:17,216 --> 01:08:20,228
Because the IRS will be down
here with their hands out.

645
01:08:21,013 --> 01:08:23,647
And don't give me any garbage
about safety deposit boxes.

646
01:08:25,117 --> 01:08:25,941
Tonight.

647
01:08:27,954 --> 01:08:28,977
Tonight.

648
01:08:29,830 --> 01:08:30,997
Good

649
01:08:32,374 --> 01:08:33,450
Up front...

650
01:08:34,128 --> 01:08:36,660
before the curtains go up, Sardu.

651
01:08:43,774 --> 01:08:45,482
Well, what did you find out?

652
01:08:45,934 --> 01:08:47,633
I hate to disappoint you, kid.

653
01:08:51,064 --> 01:08:52,270
He's on the up and up.

654
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:54,490
Sardu's on the up and up.
A little weird...

655
01:08:54,518 --> 01:08:55,735
but on the up and up.

656
01:08:55,770 --> 01:08:57,177
Giselle?
What about Giselle?

657
01:08:57,296 --> 01:08:59,314
She did it 3 years ago, in St. Louis.

658
01:08:59,533 --> 01:09:01,850
and she's got 8 performances next year.

659
01:09:02,061 --> 01:09:03,569
You know my problem is?

660
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:05,988
I've been at this job too long.

661
01:09:06,748 --> 01:09:07,937
I don't trust anyone.

662
01:09:08,236 --> 01:09:09,931
So it means, you're
going to drop the case?

663
01:09:09,932 --> 01:09:11,027
What else can I do?

664
01:09:11,547 --> 01:09:14,837
She wants to be in a freak
show.  It's a free country.

665
01:09:15,875 --> 01:09:19,586
Hey, maybe some weirdo goes down there,
gets turned on to ballet, who knows ...

666
01:09:21,266 --> 01:09:23,302
Hey, cheer up.
Why don't you and I go?

667
01:09:23,337 --> 01:09:24,638
You don't still want to go down there?

668
01:09:24,673 --> 01:09:27,555
Why not?
It it's ballet, I'm on my way!

669
01:09:28,859 --> 01:09:31,216
Well, who might have say,
what is art and what isn't?

670
01:09:32,028 --> 01:09:32,852
Let's go.

671
01:09:40,787 --> 01:09:42,646
Break a leg, Ralphus.

672
01:09:43,959 --> 01:09:45,751
Whose, master?

673
01:09:46,711 --> 01:09:49,498
Ralphus, that was just
a theatrical expression.

674
01:09:51,427 --> 01:09:52,631
Hey, Ziegfeld!

675
01:09:53,204 --> 01:09:54,461
You forget about me?

676
01:09:59,603 --> 01:10:00,528
Wait here.

677
01:10:00,688 --> 01:10:02,987
I'll take a look,
see what I can do.

678
01:10:03,206 --> 01:10:04,656
I think I'll take a look, too.

679
01:10:04,875 --> 01:10:06,641
I said, wait here.

680
01:10:35,754 --> 01:10:40,217
I promise you, you will have a
banquet before this night is through.

681
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:57,218
Stay back!
Stay back!

682
01:10:58,030 --> 01:10:59,179
Back!

683
01:11:45,233 --> 01:11:45,947
Excuse me.

684
01:11:49,105 --> 01:11:49,969
Listen...

685
01:11:50,273 --> 01:11:52,323
Sardu is holding Natasha prisoner.

686
01:11:52,801 --> 01:11:53,658
What?

687
01:11:53,844 --> 01:11:56,342
He's got a white slavery
action, 2 -300 girls a year.

688
01:11:56,571 --> 01:11:57,761
Tortures them.

689
01:11:58,823 --> 01:12:00,096
White slavery?

690
01:12:00,743 --> 01:12:03,643
It's all over town, you close 'em up
on east side, they move to the west side.

691
01:12:03,672 --> 01:12:06,682
You close them up on Park Avenue, what
do you think, they move down to Soho.

692
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:10,244
White slavery in this day and age?

693
01:12:10,964 --> 01:12:13,562
You haul them into court and
the judges let them go, you know why?

694
01:12:13,617 --> 01:12:15,683
Because they are in on the take,
like everybody else is.

695
01:12:16,804 --> 01:12:17,962
I don't believe it!

696
01:12:18,682 --> 01:12:20,795
Where do you think
half the girls wind up

697
01:12:20,796 --> 01:12:22,628
will come into this town
belong to show business?

698
01:12:23,061 --> 01:12:24,448
Off, off Broadway?

699
01:12:25,563 --> 01:12:27,555
But this time, Sardu's gone too far.

700
01:12:27,901 --> 01:12:29,025
And I'm going to fix him.

701
01:12:29,044 --> 01:12:30,865
That freak wants to be a celebrity.

702
01:12:31,947 --> 01:12:33,319
Hey, hey, hey, calm down!

703
01:12:33,448 --> 01:12:35,973
Many innocent people here,
you want anybody get hurt?

704
01:12:37,078 --> 01:12:38,652
Take it easy.

705
01:12:38,871 --> 01:12:40,113
Watch the show, huh.

706
01:12:45,003 --> 01:12:46,663
5 minutes to deck...

707
01:12:46,755 --> 01:12:47,662
5 minutes...

708
01:12:53,514 --> 01:12:56,650
You look positively magnificent, my dear.

709
01:12:56,685 --> 01:12:58,308
Thank you, master.

710
01:12:58,768 --> 01:13:02,850
The Schubert's already inquiring
about moving our show up to Broadway ...

711
01:13:02,858 --> 01:13:03,599
and then...

712
01:13:04,484 --> 01:13:05,925
Hollywood!

713
01:13:19,168 --> 01:13:21,258
And the chief inquisitor said:

714
01:13:21,377 --> 01:13:24,873
"You must be a secret Jew,
your tongue smoked!"

715
01:13:35,006 --> 01:13:37,615
I thought I told you to
stop at the Gestapo joke.

716
01:13:37,856 --> 01:13:39,978
Listen to them,
listen to them...

717
01:13:40,013 --> 01:13:41,530
They love me,
they love me...

718
01:13:47,743 --> 01:13:49,234
Actors.

719
01:14:00,458 --> 01:14:01,762
And now...

720
01:14:01,863 --> 01:14:05,023
our prima ballerina,
Natasha DeNatalie...

721
01:14:05,224 --> 01:14:07,690
in a composition of my own...

722
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:11,911
"The artist, seduction and death...

723
01:14:11,912 --> 01:14:13,653
of a critic".

724
01:16:45,186 --> 01:16:46,583
Is that Creasy Silo?

725
01:16:46,619 --> 01:16:47,683
Quiet!

726
01:18:15,097 --> 01:18:16,170
Only the two of us?

727
01:18:21,728 --> 01:18:23,678
What about the rest of the police force?

728
01:18:23,697 --> 01:18:25,181
They will make too much noise.

729
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,852
Anyway we want to keep it out
of the papers, don't we?

730
01:18:27,853 --> 01:18:28,912
Tucci.

731
01:18:31,633 --> 01:18:34,622
If I make it official, we gonna
have to cut it up too many ways.

732
01:18:35,269 --> 01:18:36,590
Cut what?

733
01:18:37,247 --> 01:18:38,939
Sardu's treasure.

734
01:18:39,250 --> 01:18:41,749
He's got a fortune
stashed away down there.

735
01:18:41,784 --> 01:18:42,825
I mean, look!

736
01:18:43,212 --> 01:18:44,827
Silver certificates.

737
01:18:45,047 --> 01:18:47,288
He hasn't spend a nickel in years.

738
01:18:47,323 --> 01:18:48,733
Hey, don't you have
any sense of justice?

739
01:18:49,051 --> 01:18:51,733
And what about the people
down in that dungeon right now?

740
01:18:52,222 --> 01:18:53,954
We'll take care of it.

741
01:18:53,989 --> 01:18:54,998
Later.

742
01:20:02,511 --> 01:20:05,489
Oh Christ. People ought to be
more careful of what they leave ....

743
01:20:08,771 --> 01:20:11,237
What the matter, kid?
Never got a little head before?

744
01:20:11,315 --> 01:20:12,338
Come on.

745
01:20:41,476 --> 01:20:43,459
You're hereby placed under arrest!

746
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:44,988
You have the right to counsel,

747
01:20:44,989 --> 01:20:48,241
not required to make any statement
without the presence of counsel.

748
01:20:48,276 --> 01:20:51,842
It is your right to remain silent and
anything you say maybe held against you.

749
01:20:51,961 --> 01:20:53,233
Understand?

750
01:20:53,672 --> 01:20:54,513
Good!

751
01:21:00,305 --> 01:21:01,339
Natasha!

752
01:21:26,819 --> 01:21:27,819
Ralphus

753
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:29,786
Master wants you.

754
01:21:44,260 --> 01:21:46,750
Come here, you little pervert!

755
01:22:05,056 --> 01:22:07,158
I may have to get some of these keys.

756
01:22:07,193 --> 01:22:08,515
Keep your eyes on these...

757
01:22:09,034 --> 01:22:10,158
weirdos.

758
01:22:20,883 --> 01:22:22,958
Okay, Sardu, freeze!

759
01:22:24,986 --> 01:22:26,458
And your boyfriend...

760
01:22:26,493 --> 01:22:27,221
too.

761
01:22:42,990 --> 01:22:44,690
- Hey, who's in there?

762
01:22:45,245 --> 01:22:47,545
He is making love to Creasy Silo.

763
01:22:47,664 --> 01:22:48,729
What?

764
01:22:49,958 --> 01:22:51,424
Creasy?

765
01:22:52,837 --> 01:22:56,711
I killed Creasy during the "pas de deux".

766
01:23:03,807 --> 01:23:05,873
There is no .... I can take.

767
01:23:07,769 --> 01:23:09,173
Tucci...

768
01:23:09,722 --> 01:23:11,115
Do me a favor?

769
01:23:11,817 --> 01:23:13,408
Hit me again!

770
01:23:13,635 --> 01:23:15,887
If he opens his mouth again, kill him!

771
01:23:17,573 --> 01:23:18,631
Please?

772
01:23:39,098 --> 01:23:41,499
Jesus Christ!

773
01:23:47,349 --> 01:23:50,239
Alright, ladies,
Shall we all spring you later?

774
01:23:54,449 --> 01:23:55,498
Shit!

775
01:24:00,241 --> 01:24:01,407
Cut it!

776
01:24:01,626 --> 01:24:04,550
There's plenty of time
to play with that later.

777
01:24:05,194 --> 01:24:06,789
You know how to get in though?

778
01:24:23,934 --> 01:24:26,861
Okay, ladies,
We got to get a job to do.

779
01:24:44,783 --> 01:24:46,736
Come on.
We gotta help him.

780
01:24:51,975 --> 01:24:53,333
Let's get out of here!

781
01:24:55,228 --> 01:24:56,761
My master!

782
01:24:57,231 --> 01:24:59,322
You hurt my master.

783
01:24:59,899 --> 01:25:00,848
Come on!

784
01:25:52,821 --> 01:25:53,637
Come on!

785
01:25:54,381 --> 01:25:55,456
Come on!

786
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:57,824
What's the matter with you?
Come on!

787
01:25:58,042 --> 01:25:59,993
I must get back to my master.

788
01:26:03,099 --> 01:26:05,043
Come on! Let's go.
Let's get out of here!

789
01:26:06,285 --> 01:26:07,393
God damn it!

790
01:26:24,268 --> 01:26:25,134
Tom!

791
01:26:46,604 --> 01:26:48,707
I'm coming, master!
