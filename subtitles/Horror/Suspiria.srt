1
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,080
Suzy Bannion decided to
perfect her ballet studies...

2
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,800
In the most famous school of dance in Europe.

3
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,450
She chose the celebrated academy of Freiburg.

4
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,160
One day at 9:00 in the morning,
She left Kennedy airport, New york,

5
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,830
And arrived in Germany at
10:40 p.m. Local time.

6
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,880
Taxi!

7
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,200
Taxi, taxi!

8
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,390
Taxi! Hey, taxi!

9
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,640
Taxi! Taxi!

10
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,440
Can you give me a hand?

11
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,600
Uh, Escherstrausse.

12
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,720
-Was?
-Escherstrausse.

13
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,650
Was?

14
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,370
Ah, Escherstrausse.

15
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,640
Ja, ja.

16
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,100
Has it been raining this hard for long?

17
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,010
Half an hour.

18
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,820
Can you wait a minute, please?

19
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,690
-Hello?
-Who is it?

20
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,070
Suzy Bannion. I just got in from New York.

21
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,420
-I don't know you. Go away!
-But I have the letter you sent.

22
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,770
Look, it's really raining hard. You
could just let me in and I'll explain.

23
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,190
-Go away. Go away!
-But you don't understand!

24
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,950
Wait! Wait a minute. Wait.

25
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,220
Hello. Is anybody there?

26
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:18,150
Hello?

27
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,120
If you're happy enough with the couch,
you can stay for as long as you please.

28
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,470
Thanks, but I'll be leaving in the morning.

29
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,360
-I'm going away forever.
-Oh, big deal, kid.

30
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,760
So what if you've been thrown out of school?

31
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,590
I always got kicked out of school,
beginning in kindergarten.

32
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,970
No, that's not it. I don't give a
damn about getting kicked out.

33
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,120
Well, then?

34
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,510
It's useless to try and explain it to you.

35
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,430
You wouldn't understand.

36
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,850
It all seems so...Absurd,

37
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,770
So fantastic.

38
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:09,420
All I can do is get away from
here as soon as possible.

39
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,400
Would you mind if I used the
bathroom? I'd like to dry off.

40
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,690
No, of course not. Go ahead.

41
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,700
Hey, why don't you close it?

42
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,460
That's better. It was just the wind.

43
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:48,300
You sure are in bad shape.

44
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,530
You have to tell me all about it.

45
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,360
The wind! The windows burst open.

46
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,740
-I got scared.
-No. That's not it.

47
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,100
I mean, what it is that's got you so upset.

48
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:08,820
Okay, you can tell me about it later.

49
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,490
Let me in! Pat!

50
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,050
Pat! Pat!

51
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:36,840
Help me! Help me!
There's a murderer!

52
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:43,210
Help me! Help!
There's a murderer!

53
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,200
Help me! Help!

54
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,490
No! No! No!

55
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,730
Help me!

56
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,260
Help!

57
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,220
There's a murderer!

58
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:50,140
No!

59
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,420
Good morning. Good morning, Daniel.

60
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,350
Good morning, miss Tanner.

61
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,000
-Good morning. May I help you?
-Yes, I'm Suzy Bannion.

62
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,870
We expected you yesterday evening.
You wrote us that--

63
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,280
Right. I did arrive
last night about 10:00.

64
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:57,150
But the door was locked,
and somebody on the call box...

65
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,550
Said they didn't know who
I was and couldn't let me in.

66
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,920
-Who said that to you?
-I don't know. She didn't say her name.

67
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:05,800
I'm so sorry. At any rate,
Now you're here among us,

68
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:10,110
So welcome to our academy. I'm miss
Tanner, one of the instructors.

69
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,030
Nice to meet you.

70
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,920
Come along. I'd like to
introduce you to madame Blanc,

71
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,840
Our vice directress.

72
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,760
She was a very famous ballerina.

73
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,680
-Madame Blanc?
-Yes?

74
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,920
Suzy Bannion, our new student.

75
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,600
Oh, yes.

76
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,280
-Excuse me, gentlemen.
-Of course, madame.

77
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:36,040
You're pretty. Very pretty
indeed. They're policemen.

78
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:40,360
I knew a woman called Bannion years
ago in New York. Carol Bannion.

79
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,240
-She's my aunt.
-Good! She's a marvelous woman,

80
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,640
A friend and benefactress
of artists everywhere.

81
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:49,010
I'm delighted to have her niece here.

82
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,000
Well, I offer our academy's official
welcome in the name of our directress,

83
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,400
Who unfortunately is not
here at the moment.

84
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,800
-She's traveling abroad.
-Thank you.

85
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:00,630
Albert, please wait for me upstairs.

86
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,520
He's my nephew. I'm very attached to him.

87
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,450
I must tell you what I
have to say very quickly...

88
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,840
Because those gentlemen
are waiting for me.

89
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,710
Something terrible, truly
horrible, has happened.

90
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,520
One of our students, Pat Hingle, who was
expelled just yesterday for improper conduct,

91
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:19,600
Was murdered last night by some
madman. It's a frightening story.

92
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:22,000
But I always warn our students,
Don't I, miss Tanner?

93
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,410
I tell them to be careful, not to get
involved with questionable friendships.

94
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:28,240
What I wanted to tell you was that
your room here isn't free yet.

95
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,170
-Just a slight hitch.
-Yes, but don't worry.

96
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:34,480
We've found you a place to stay with one of
our third-year students who lives in town.

97
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:37,840
You'll have to pay 50 of your
American dollars a week,

98
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:40,720
But it's a good price, and you can
deduct it from your fee here.

99
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:44,100
Now I entrust you to the care of miss Tanner,
one of our veteran teachers here.

100
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:49,840
Don't be upset if she seems a little
stern or surly. It's only her manner.
She's even that way with me.

101
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,740
She really is an invaluable teacher.

102
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,930
-Come with me.
-And now, gentlemen--

103
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,060
As you know, our courses last three years,

104
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,460
And you must pass an exam
at the end of each year.

105
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,330
So, the girl left the school
About 11:00 in the evening?

106
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:09,180
-That's my information.
-Excuse me.

107
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:12,540
When I got here last night about 11:00,
I saw a girl leaving the school.

108
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:15,890
She's a new student. She just
arrived. What did she look like?

109
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,750
Well, she had blonde hair and
was wearing a brown raincoat.

110
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:24,060
-What did she do?
-I don't know. I only saw her
for a minute in a storm.

111
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,940
So you see? It really was 11:00.

112
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,830
Coming?

113
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:34,620
We don't teach you how to dance here,
because we presume our students already know how.

114
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:38,460
This is an established academy
dedicated to specializing.

115
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,340
This is Pavlos, our general handyman.

116
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,980
He's really ugly, isn't he?
don't be afraid to say so.

117
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,730
He can't understand you, anyway.
He speaks only Romanian.

118
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:51,070
You see that gorgeous smile? He's been very
handsome ever since he got those false teeth.

119
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,770
Last year, he discovered He
had gingivitis of the gums,

120
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,180
So he had all his teeth pulled.

121
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:03,060
The top row one morning.
The bottom row a day later.

122
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,970
Bang.

123
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,370
-Where are we going?
-To the locker room.

124
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,750
We also have a swimming pool,
which you can use when you want.

125
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:18,340
Miss Tanner. I have something to tell you.

126
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:21,220
-Squawk, squawk. Polly parrot.
-Who said that? Shut up.

127
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,620
That's enough of these little
games for the moment.

128
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:27,460
I want to introduce Suzy Bannion, our new student.

129
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:31,310
You'll find several fellow Americans
among these girls--Miriam, for one.

130
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,180
-Hello.
-Hi.
-Your locker's over there.

131
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,580
You'll find everything in there except shoes.

132
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:40,430
For today, you can borrow shoes
from someone who has two pairs.

133
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,270
Hurry up, everybody. I'll be waiting
for all of you in the red room.

134
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,150
Come with me.

135
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:58,670
Mata Hari is going to file her report.

136
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,910
My name is Olga, and you're my tenant.

137
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,820
Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

138
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:09,710
They tell me you have to give me $50 a week.

139
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,110
-Yeah.
-In advance.

140
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,510
Well, don't worry. If you think I'm not--Oh--

141
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,350
Don't get hot under the collar.
That's how people are here.

142
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,150
Uh, can anybody lend me a pair of shoes?

143
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,030
-Yes. Me.
-Oh, thank you.

144
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,910
If you want to buy them, I can make
you a nice price. Fifteen marks.

145
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,790
Oh, no, thanks. I already have some in my suitcase.

146
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,720
I just need a pair for today.

147
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,640
But if you'd rather not--

148
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,520
No. Okay. Go ahead. Take them.

149
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,400
-But, uh, Give them back, hmm?
-Of course.

150
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,120
Oh, excuse me.
I'm sorry.

151
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,050
Oh, it's okay. It doesn't matter.

152
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,720
Did they shake you up with all
that talk about money?

153
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,650
Well, I'm not exactly used to it.

154
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,040
Same with me at first.

155
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,440
Then I found out it's a
charming habit around here.

156
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,600
I once read that names...

157
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:15,950
Which begin With the letter "S"...

158
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,370
Are the names of snakes.

159
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,170
Next year, after I finish the course,

160
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:29,050
I've got an offer from the
state school of ballet in Geneva.

161
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,920
What about you?

162
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:35,780
Well, I'll go back to yhe states,
but I'm not exactly sure what I'll do.

163
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,130
Hey, thanks.
My room is really pretty.

164
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,050
-Like it?
-Uh-huh.

165
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:45,370
That makes me happy. I bet we'll do
nicely together. I think you're sweet.

166
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,290
Even if I have the name of a snake?

167
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,210
I was just kidding.

168
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,620
Don't tell me you're as touchy as Sara.

169
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:54,020
No.

170
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,770
Hello?

171
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,660
Oh, hi! No, no, no.

172
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,590
You did the right thing.

173
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,940
-Hi.
-Hi.

174
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,090
Oh, you didn't have to bring these over here.

175
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,510
I could've picked them up myself tomorrow.

176
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,900
I thought you might be needing them.

177
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,820
Yes, but it really wasn't necessary.

178
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:21,150
-Anyway, thanks a lot.
-Oh, no. It's nothing.

179
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,540
-Ciao.
-Ciao.

180
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:26,420
-Don't you want to stay for a while?
-No, thanks. I can't.

181
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:30,260
I live at the school, so I've got to
be back for supper in half an hour.

182
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,180
-I have to.
-Just for a minute?

183
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,580
No, no, really. I have to be going.

184
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,460
They get very upset if you
show up late for supper.

185
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:41,780
-Okay, sunday. No, not before lunchtime.
-Well, ciao.

186
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:44,180
See you tomorrow.

187
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,100
Bye.

188
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,030
No, go on.

189
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,870
Uh-huh, I know.

190
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:55,710
You caught one. Yes, yes, I can
hear you very well.

191
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,630
Didn't you see how he was blushing?

192
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,510
He's cute, except he doesn't have any, um--

193
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,860
And he never has enough money
for room and board at school.

194
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:06,260
That's why that bitch Tanner
has got him under her thumb.

195
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,670
She gives him 1,001 errands to do.

196
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,550
Sure.

197
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,470
I got it. Okay.

198
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,340
Call me back tomorrow evening.
Give me a chance to think it over.

199
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,620
Yes, yes. Okay, okay.

200
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,020
Anyway, he is cute.

201
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:23,910
Poor Pat. She liked him a lot.

202
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,740
That poor kid, ending up like that.

203
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,150
I can't even think about it.

204
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,550
I heard you saw her yesterday evening.

205
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,420
Uh-huh. Outside the school.

206
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,830
She was acting very strange.

207
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,750
Mumbling to herself.

208
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,160
She really felt terrible when they kicked
her out, but she really deserved it.

209
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,950
-There was so much noise.
-God, was she difficult.

210
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,350
She was saying things that made no sense.

211
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,720
She was always arguing, causing trouble.

212
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,840
"Secret."

213
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,470
"Iris."

214
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,920
What?

215
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,240
Uh, I remember...

216
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,170
She mentioned the word "secret."

217
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:12,990
And then she...Mentioned a flower--

218
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,910
Iris, I think, or a lilac.

219
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,320
Secret flowers? What's
that supposed to mean?

220
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:20,200
I don't know. She was a busybody.

221
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:24,040
It would've been easy for her to
find out one of us was in a jam.

222
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:55,640
-How do you like it at Olga's?
-It's nice.

223
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:59,500
Those eight on the list this morning,
come with me to the yellow room.

224
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:05,240
Good morning, miss Tanner. Suzy.

225
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:08,130
-Good morning, madame Blanc.
-I've got good news for you.

226
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,020
We have it all arranged.
Your room is ready for you.

227
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,890
Isn't that marvelous? You can
move in today, if you like.

228
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,300
But I'd rather stay at Olga's, if it's okay.

229
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,690
Doesn't matter to me, my dear,

230
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,570
But in your letter of enrollment, you
said you'd be boarding at the school.

231
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:24,440
-I know, but--
-The room is free now.

232
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:27,810
-Well, I didn't think it was so important.
-As you wish.

233
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,220
If that's what you want, so be it.

234
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,140
Sara?

235
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,890
I had no idea you were so strong-willed.

236
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,770
I see that when you make up
your mind about something,

237
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:55,180
Nothing will change it for you.

238
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:57,100
My compliments.

239
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,870
Witch!

240
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,830
And then, toward the end of the 19th century,

241
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:39,700
The technique of classical ballet...

242
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:43,070
Assumed a different, more stylized impostation.

243
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,910
All right. Let's warm up.

244
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:49,780
What's wrong? Don't you feel well?

245
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:53,150
No, it's nothing. I just feel a little weak.

246
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,550
If it gets any worse, I'll just stop.

247
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,470
And now some exercises.

248
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:00,350
Daniel, you may begin.

249
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,120
One, two, three and four.

250
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:11,520
And one and two...

251
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,930
And three and four.

252
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,480
And one and two...

253
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,400
And three and four.

254
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,320
-And one--
-I'm sorry, miss Tanner.

255
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,670
I feel a little weak. Can I
just rest for a second?

256
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,790
Weak? Come on. It's an easy step.

257
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,200
This is the first time we've worked together.

258
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,080
I want to see what you can do,
how far along you are.

259
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,920
Now, come along and join the others.
Come on; let's go.

260
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,550
Daniel?

261
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,440
All together now.

262
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,230
And one and two...

263
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,120
And three and four.

264
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,440
-I can't. Please.
-And one and two...

265
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:54,360
And three and four.

266
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:59,640
And one and two and three and four.

267
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,720
And one and two and three and four.

268
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:07,800
Pay attention, Suzy. Get those legs
up higher. You're not paralyzed.

269
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,920
Get those legs up higher.
And one and two and three and--

270
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:16,920
Pay attention, Suzy. And one and two...

271
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:19,310
And three and four.

272
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,170
And one and two and three and four.

273
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,980
Come on. Come on. Run along.

274
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:57,370
Come on. Drink up.

275
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:00,250
-Oh, you--You must drink.
-No, that's enough.

276
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,650
You heard what the doctor said.

277
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:05,060
-Drink up.
-No.

278
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,990
You must drink.

279
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:09,970
The blood that was hemorrhaging is
going back with the intake of liquids.

280
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:13,810
-Right, professor Verdegast?
-Obviously.

281
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,200
My dear madame.

282
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:20,050
Do not be concerned. It's nothing,
as I've already told the young lady.

283
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,930
That's a relief, professor.
How do you feel, dear?

284
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,820
-Uh, better.
-The fault lies with your exercises.

285
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:31,090
When somebody's been out of practice,
violent movement could cause tiny
tears in internal ligaments.

286
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,020
Thus the hemorrhaging.

287
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,860
You look better already. You've
even got color back in your cheeks.

288
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,780
-Isn't that right?
-Oh, yes. She looks much better.

289
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,700
-Ow!
-Hold still.

290
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:44,060
This will get you back into shape in no time.

291
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,820
Here we are. Fine, fine. A day or two,
you'll be on your feet, as good as new.

292
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,540
-Who brought my bags here?
-Olga. What a dear.

293
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:59,430
The minute she heard you were ill, she
went right home and brought your things.

294
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,250
Oh, and she also left me your $50,
and she didn't take a penny of it.

295
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:06,140
Why--Why did she do that?

296
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:09,020
-If I wanted to, I would--
-Well, my dear,

297
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:11,890
What you need now is
some peace and quiet.

298
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,260
If the hemorrhaging should start
again, which is very improbable,

299
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,660
You can telephone me.

300
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:21,030
And Tanner, she is to eat
bland food for about a week.

301
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,420
And you mustn't let
her have any fruit.

302
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,820
-A drop of vin rose?
-Yes.

303
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:29,180
Good. A glass of red wine with
each meal. It works miracles.

304
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:32,550
Clears up anemia and strengthens
red corpuscles. It builds the blood.

305
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:36,390
Rest well. You're in good hands.

306
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,540
Suzy, we're next-door neighbors.

307
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:05,430
So, you moved in here.

308
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,310
Well, they moved me in here.

309
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,230
I really didn't want to.

310
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:13,590
You know, as soon as I got sick,
your pal Olga ran and got my bags...

311
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,510
And threw me out of her place.

312
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,880
She must've thought I had
something awfully contagious.

313
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:23,670
But I can't stand to live in a
boarding school like a ten-year-old.

314
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,550
Oh, wow. You come back strong.

315
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,950
Yeah, you know, I feel really well.

316
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,310
I mean, it's almost as if nothing
had happened. It's incredible.

317
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,670
-And all thanks to professor Verdegast.
-Verdegast?

318
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,590
-He came to look at you?
-Yeah.

319
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,000
Come in.

320
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,320
Hi, Pavlos.

321
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,690
Thank you.

322
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:01,480
You'd better keep an eye on that
lighter. He really likes it.

323
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:03,400
Yes, but I don't think he's a thief.

324
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,320
At least you know.

325
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:09,170
-Are you eating up here?
-Yeah, they put me on a restricted diet.

326
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:12,040
And on a restricted diet, they give you wine?

327
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:15,890
That's professor Verdegast's idea.
Says it'll build up my blood.

328
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:24,880
The bell. Oh, god. That means
it's only 15 minutes till supper.

329
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:27,280
I'd better change.

330
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:30,170
-Ciao. See you later.
-Okay.

331
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,980
Where? Where?

332
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:00,900
Everywhere. The whole floor.

333
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,770
It's disgusting! It's disgusting!

334
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,180
-Where are they coming from?
-I don't know! Let's go and see!

335
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:09,550
-They're coming from the ceiling.
-In the meantime, everybody downstairs.

336
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,080
Don't let anyone come up.

337
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,230
I'm sorry. Truly mortified.
Please excuse me.

338
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,150
But it was nothing to do
with you, madame.

339
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,030
No, of course not, girls.
It was not madame Blanc's fault.

340
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,680
We ordered those cases
of food by mail...

341
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,080
From a reliable firm that
we thought to be honest.

342
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,890
Obviously, It arrived spoiled.

343
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:35,280
In a few days' time,
you see what happened.

344
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:37,920
-Oh, it was awful.
-Yes, one got in my mouth.

345
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:41,760
I suppose we're fortunate those things
only reached the floor below the attic.

346
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:44,640
-Are the other floors all right?
-Yes. We checked them out.

347
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:46,560
Just the floor where the
students' rooms are.

348
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:49,440
Well, I'll take care of the problem
of fumigating in the morning.

349
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:52,800
In the meantime, for tonight, I've
thought of a makeshift arrangement.

350
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:55,210
Go and see how they're getting
along, will you, dear?

351
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:59,040
The boys have kindly offered to help,

352
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:01,460
And they and the servants are turning
the practice hall into a dormitory.

353
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:05,280
If some of you choose to find hotel
rooms, I'll have no objections.

354
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:07,200
But it's already late,
and in any case,

355
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:09,120
The inconvenience will only
be for one night.

356
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,400
We'll all sleep together.

357
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,760
-Bravo.
-You all right?

358
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:17,170
-Yes, thank you.
-Fine.

359
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,570
-Is everything all right?
-Yes, thank you.

360
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,480
-Good.
-Are you all right?

361
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,410
Yes, madame Blanc. Thank you.

362
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,290
-Oh, it's very comfortable. Just like being in camp.
-Good.

363
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,690
Are you sleeping here with
us, too, Madame Blanc?

364
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:31,090
Certainly, as are all the other
teachers and miss Tanner.

365
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:33,960
Do the teachers live here at school?

366
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:35,880
No, they live in town.

367
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:39,250
They leave after supper at
9:30, just like clockwork.

368
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,300
It's very late. You won't be afraid
if I turn out the lights?

369
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,180
-Good night, everyone.
-Good night. Good night.

370
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:24,210
Is that guy hot for you?

371
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:26,090
-Maybe.
-That's funny.

372
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,870
I heard he was, uh--

373
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,220
-Of course, I'm not much of a gossip.
-That's a good one.

374
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,660
Come on. You tried to get
him and didn't make it.

375
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,570
-You liar! That's not--
-Why don't you two shut up?

376
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,020
Some of us want to go to sleep.

377
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:49,180
Hey, Sara. Forget it. It's okay.

378
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,200
Suzy, are you asleep?

379
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:11,800
-Were you sleeping?
-No. What's the matter?

380
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:15,780
You hear that snoring?

381
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:18,510
It's weird.

382
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,300
Hear it?

383
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:23,570
Where do you think it's coming from?

384
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:32,840
Behind the sheet.

385
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,270
Lies!

386
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,250
What?

387
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,520
They lied to us.

388
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:44,920
The directress is here.

389
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:48,280
That's her, the one who's snoring.

390
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:50,680
She's the directress.

391
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:53,070
-How do you know?
-I'm sure it's her.

392
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,190
Last year, for a while,

393
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,220
I lived in one of the guest rooms...

394
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,290
Under the top of the stairs.

395
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,580
One night,

396
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:11,190
I heard someone coming very late in,

397
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,220
Getting into bed in the room next to mine.

398
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:17,250
And then--

399
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:20,720
Then I heard this weird kind of snoring.

400
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:24,130
I tell you, it was so weird
I never forgot it.

401
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,970
Listen.

402
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,410
You hear that whistle?

403
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,430
It's exactly the same.

404
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:39,250
The next morning, madame Blanc told me...

405
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,650
That the directress had spent
a few hours at the school...

406
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:44,570
And had slept in the room next to mine.

407
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:48,540
You see?

408
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:52,450
So I know she's the directress.

409
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,420
She's here.

410
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,360
She's there.

411
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:02,320
Right behind that sheet.

412
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,570
Thank you. I'm grateful you can take
care of the fumigating so promptly.

413
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:29,450
-Good morning, madame Blanc.
-Good morning, Daniel.

414
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:32,810
-Is everything in order now?
-All cleaned up, madame.

415
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,220
Just to be sure, we checked
the other floors too.

416
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,970
Miss Tanner. Excuse me.

417
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,890
Did the directress sleep
here last night?

418
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,780
-No, she didn't. Good morning, Daniel.
-Good morning.

419
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:50,100
You know she's away on a trip. Maybe
she'll pay us a visit two weeks from now.

420
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:53,450
Excuse me, miss Tanner, But which
class do I attend this morning?

421
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,370
The second-year class in the red room.

422
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,300
Thank you.

423
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:56,100
Stop!

424
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,990
Stop! Stop!

425
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,860
Enough. Enough!

426
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:04,740
-Do you know what happened? Do you know?
-What day is it?

427
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:08,110
Your lousy, disgusting
dog has bitten Albert!

428
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,040
He took a piece out
of Albert's arm.

429
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,900
-What?
-Did you all hear that?

430
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:15,790
That miserable dog tried
to mutilate a child.

431
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,630
Madame Blanc had to rush Albert to
a first-aid center to have stitches put in!

432
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:23,000
-That's impossible.
-Let's go to the first-aid center.

433
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:26,350
Even if you can't see the blood, at least
you can hear the poor child's crying.

434
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,280
That's enough now!

435
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:32,110
My dog's a peaceful, faithful
animal. He's never hurt anyone.

436
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,510
The boy must have done
something to him first!

437
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,870
Oh, the poor little animal!
The poor little puppy!

438
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:42,190
If I ever see him within a mile of this
school again, I'll have him put to death!

439
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,110
Stop it!

440
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,040
I won't allow such talk, you understand?

441
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,910
You won't allow it?

442
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,320
Then get out! You and your dog!

443
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,680
-Get moving!
-You bitch!

444
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:56,600
Out!

445
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:59,470
I'm going. I'm going.

446
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,880
But try to understand that--

447
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,730
That I'm blind, not deaf.

448
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:08,120
Get it? Huh?

449
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:10,040
Not deaf.

450
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,670
Not deaf. You understand that?

451
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,610
You understand?

452
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:19,880
Ahh, fresh air!

453
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:22,280
Let me out of this gilded parade.

454
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:26,610
Get out! Get out of here! Good riddance!

455
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:33,810
Oh, Pavlos, how much longer
do I have to eat like this?

456
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:59,330
Hey, listen.

457
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:03,160
There they go, right on schedule.

458
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:05,570
The teachers. Remember?

459
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:10,380
Can you hear them?
They're going away.

460
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:16,130
You hear them?

461
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,980
Yes.

462
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,350
I--

463
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:39,300
I--I don't think they'll
even miss school.

464
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:42,180
What? What did you say?

465
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,580
Wake up.

466
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:48,910
I said, it doesn't seem to
me that they're going out.

467
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:52,760
A front door is on the left.

468
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:57,550
Their footsteps are going to the
right, somewhere inside the school.

469
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:01,860
Jesus, Suzy.

470
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:02,870
-You're a genius.
-Mmm.

471
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,180
Fantastic.

472
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:09,490
How come I never noticed that before?

473
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:14,310
Suzy. If they don't leave,
Where do they go?

474
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:16,700
Wake up. Suzy.

475
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:21,320
Come on. Wake up. Suzy!

476
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,150
I'm so sleepy.

477
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,070
I don't know why. I'm sorry.

478
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,940
Maybe--

479
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:32,360
Maybe we can find out where they really go.

480
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:38,120
Of course!
Yes.

481
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:44,360
Begin to count the steps as they go.

482
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,840
It's like the search of alietne.

483
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,750
Easy.

484
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:26,100
What is it? Huh?

485
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:28,030
Come on.

486
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:31,390
Come on; let's go home.

487
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:55,630
Who is that? Who's there?

488
00:50:57,070 --> 00:50:59,120
Easy, boy.

489
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,330
What is it?

490
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:10,760
What's happening?

491
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,610
Who's there?

492
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,270
Who's there?

493
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:39,760
Wait!

494
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:34,290
Poor Daniel. Torn to pieces. Incredible.

495
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:37,170
Oh, yeah, but you can never put
too much trust in wolfhounds.

496
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:40,530
They're crazy. We had two of them
once at the villa in Gestaad.

497
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:43,420
My god. First Pat gets
murdered by a madman,

498
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,810
And now Daniel is killed by his dog.

499
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:48,220
Yeah. Maybe there's a hex on the place.

500
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:52,550
Yeah. Let's call in the exorcist
and have it purged.

501
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:56,860
-What is it? Is something wrong?
-No, everything's all right.

502
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,490
Is it something personal, dear?

503
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,900
No, no, it's nothing like that.

504
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:05,750
Miss Tanner, would you mind?

505
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:07,790
I'd like a few minutes
alone with Suzy.

506
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:14,990
Well? What is it?

507
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:18,840
I just wanted to talk to you about some of
the things that have been happening lately.

508
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:22,190
Oh, I know you're upset by Daniel's
death, as we all have been.

509
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,110
No, but it's more than that.

510
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:26,990
Does anybody know anything
about who killed Pat?

511
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:28,920
I spoke with the chief of
police just this morning.

512
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,320
He told me they had
some definite clues.

513
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,670
-You know that I saw her the night I arrived here.
-Yes, you told me that.

514
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:38,040
And that she was mumbling some
strange, unrelated words.

515
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,910
No, you didn't tell me that.

516
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:44,270
Because it was something that didn't
make any sense. It was in a thunderstorm.

517
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,150
I just didn't pay much attention to it.

518
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,030
I only caught two words distinctly:

519
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,430
"Secret" and "Irises."

520
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:55,790
I don't know what they mean, but
I thought they might be important.

521
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,710
You've done very well. Congratulations.

522
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:00,590
I don't know what the words
"Secret" or "Irises" mean either.

523
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,990
But I think it's only right we should
let the police know about it.

524
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,290
I'm only amazed you waited
two days before-- hello?

525
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:10,940
-You really messed things up.
-What are you talking about?

526
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:13,840
Because... Maybe Pat was talking to...

527
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,720
Someone just inside the building that night.

528
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:22,960
And we know that someone
wasn't one of the teachers.

529
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,350
Come on.

530
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,150
Now you've put them
on the hunt for somebody.

531
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,030
What difference does that make to you?

532
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,960
Big difference.

533
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,800
Because I was Pat's friend.

534
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,670
She was telling me something
When you suddenly showed up.

535
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:51,040
She got scared and she ran away.

536
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:53,440
She was in hysterics almost.

537
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,830
And then she was killed.

538
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:59,190
Remember that voice when you rang the bell?

539
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,610
Well, that was me.

540
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:59,210
I heard strange, incredible, absurd things.

541
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:01,610
Pat was taking notes on them for months.

542
00:57:01,610 --> 00:57:04,960
And before going away,
she gave me all the notes.

543
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:08,330
I've only told one person,
a very good friend of mine.

544
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:11,220
Frank Mandel. He's here
for a convention.

545
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:14,570
I'll let you read them tonight.

546
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:28,620
Suzy, wake up. Please. Wake up.

547
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:31,980
The notes are gone! Someone
stole them from me!

548
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:35,580
You understand? They disappeared.

549
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:40,260
Don't fall asleep! Please help me!

550
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:43,380
-Wake up! Help me!
-I can't.

551
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:45,060
Can't?

552
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:52,250
This is the only thing I got left,
and that's because I kept it on me. Look.

553
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,650
-Look.
-What is it?

554
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:58,980
What's the matter with you? Don't
you remember? What's going on?

555
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:03,050
This is the key that'll get us
wherever the teachers go every night.

556
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:06,900
I thought it out yesterday evening
while I was sitting here next to you.

557
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:12,390
Suzy, do you know
anything about witches?

558
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:20,560
Oh, no! Please!

559
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,350
Don't leave me alone!

560
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:39,760
I must get away!

561
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:34,650
Wait!

562
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:56,940
Wait!

563
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:30,430
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

564
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:14,140
Looking for Sara? She's disappeared.

565
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:17,020
But that's impossible. I just
talked to her last night.

566
01:06:17,030 --> 01:06:20,870
She left this morning, as a matter
of fact, without telling anyone.

567
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:24,220
Just packed her bags and left. She
was heard leaving about 6:00.

568
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:27,580
-You heard her leave, didn't you?
-Sara? Oh, yes.

569
01:06:27,590 --> 01:06:30,950
I heard the door close and her
footsteps going down the hall.

570
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:34,780
And then I heard a car driving off down the
street. I guess someone was waiting for her.

571
01:06:34,790 --> 01:06:39,600
-But it's impossible.
-If she wasn't happy here, she could've told someone.

572
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,480
Why sneak off like a thief?

573
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:56,160
Hello. May I speak to Frank
Mandel, please? Yes, thank you.

574
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:00,470
Hello. This is Suzy Bannion.

575
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:03,350
No, we've never met. I'm a
friend of Sara's.

576
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:07,690
Yes. Hello. Do you happen to
know where Sara is?

577
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:12,000
Well, she disappeared from
school this morning.

578
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:15,350
Yes, it seems she left and
took all her luggage.

579
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:19,680
Yes. Uh, listen, could I see
you sometime today?

580
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:23,510
Well, I'm really worried about her.

581
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:27,840
Oh, great. Where?

582
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:31,200
At the convention center.
Okay. I'll see you there.

583
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:34,550
She didn't inform any of her classmates.
I've already asked all of them.

584
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:37,930
It's very upsetting. I can't
understand why she did it.

585
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:40,800
I'm the one who's held responsible
by their families.

586
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:44,280
I'll call her father in Geneva.
Perhaps she might have gone there.

587
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:00,590
I've already phoned Sara's father.
He's the Italian consul in Geneva.

588
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:04,910
But he wasn't there today.
He was away for the weekend.

589
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:08,760
They said he'd be back by monday, and
they don't know anything about her there.

590
01:08:08,770 --> 01:08:11,640
Well, do you understand
Why I'm so worried?

591
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:15,950
Yes, but before we both get upset,
let's wait for the father's return.

592
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:19,320
Maybe they got together this morning
and went off on their own.

593
01:08:19,330 --> 01:08:25,070
I know her quite well. She was a
patient of mine three years ago.

594
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:28,920
-Were you aware of that?
-No. I didn't even know you were a psychiatrist.

595
01:08:28,930 --> 01:08:33,250
Well, she had a nervous breakdown
after her mother's death,

596
01:08:33,730 --> 01:08:35,640
And she came to me for treatment.

597
01:08:36,130 --> 01:08:39,480
After she got better again,
we remained friends,

598
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:44,280
But lately she was upset about some notions
put into her head by a friend of hers.

599
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:47,170
-Not you, I hope?
-No.

600
01:08:47,410 --> 01:08:49,800
They were kind of wild ideas.

601
01:08:49,810 --> 01:08:54,130
She had discovered that the
Tam academy was founded...

602
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:58,570
In 1895 by a certain Helena Markos,
A Greek immigrant,

603
01:08:58,580 --> 01:09:01,950
And that the local people
believed her to be a witch.

604
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:07,210
-I guess you knew that?
-No. But I have a strange feeling...

605
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:12,500
That somebody already told me
about it--Or something similar.

606
01:09:12,510 --> 01:09:14,410
I can't--can't remember.

607
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:18,260
Well, that really got Sara's imagination
going. Earlier in the 19th century,

608
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:22,920
The Markos woman had been expelled
from several european countries.

609
01:09:22,930 --> 01:09:28,220
She seemed to have something about her
which urged religious people to persecute her.

610
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:33,010
She also wrote a number of books, and
I read that among the initiated,

611
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:36,500
She went by the name "The Black Queen."

612
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:40,340
After she settled down here, she became
the subject of a lot of gossip.

613
01:09:40,350 --> 01:09:44,180
Nevertheless, she managed to put
her hands on a great deal of money,

614
01:09:44,190 --> 01:09:46,580
And she founded the Tam academy--

615
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:51,490
At first a sort of school of
dance and occult sciences.

616
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:54,380
But that didn't last long,
because in 1905,

617
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:57,250
After being hounded and
cursed at for ten years,

618
01:09:57,260 --> 01:10:00,610
Madame Markos died in a fire.

619
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:03,980
That's all there is, as far
as witchcraft is concerned.

620
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:08,910
The school was taken over by her favorite
pupil. The study of the occult was abandoned.

621
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:13,220
And soon the place became
the famous dance academy.

622
01:10:13,230 --> 01:10:18,030
But what does it mean to be a witch?

623
01:10:18,270 --> 01:10:21,500
Well, as a believer in the material
world and a psychiatrist to boot,

624
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:25,820
I'm convinced that the current spread
of belief in magic and the occult...

625
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:29,170
Is part of mental illness.

626
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:34,470
Bad luck isn't brought by broken
mirrors, but by broken minds.

627
01:10:35,910 --> 01:10:38,260
Excuse me. Milius?

628
01:10:38,350 --> 01:10:40,760
Professor Milius can answer your
question better than I can.

629
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:44,110
He wrote a book called paranoia
or magic, and believe me,

630
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:46,040
It's the final word on the subject.

631
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:50,350
Excuse me, Milius. If you don't mind,
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.

632
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:54,190
-Fraulein.
-She's interested in your favorite subject:

633
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,590
Witches.

634
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:59,970
Can you tell her something
about the mysterious?

635
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:04,270
Well, I have to go. I have an
appointment to keep.

636
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:06,670
Keep me posted, Hmm?

637
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:09,070
Hello. I'm sorry to bother you.

638
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:13,390
Ah, so, what would you like to know?

639
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:16,750
-Do you believe in the existence of witches?
-Ah.

640
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:20,600
I have known some women who
are said to be witches.

641
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:23,950
-Really?
-I have studied the phenomenon for a long time.

642
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:26,360
I am of the opinion that
it is an important appendage...

643
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:29,720
Of contemporary psychiatry.

644
01:11:29,730 --> 01:11:31,640
You're skeptical, my dear.

645
01:11:31,650 --> 01:11:35,000
Well, frankly, it is a little
hard to believe.

646
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:41,830
-What do witches do?
-They are malefic, negative and destructive.

647
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:46,160
Their knowledge of the art of the occult
gives them tremendous powers.

648
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:51,450
They can change the course of events and
people's lives, but only to do harm.

649
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:55,750
-You don't believe me?
-No, I--

650
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:59,110
Their goal is to accumulate
great personal wealth,

651
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:02,960
But that can only be achieved
by injury to others.

652
01:12:02,970 --> 01:12:06,310
They can cause suffering,
sickness and even the death...

653
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:10,160
Of those who, for whatever
reason, have offended them.

654
01:12:12,330 --> 01:12:15,440
Why do you have all this
interest in the occult?

655
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:18,310
Because some friends spoke
to me about witches.

656
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:21,200
I read some stuff.

657
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:24,090
Have you ever heard of Helena Markos?

658
01:12:24,570 --> 01:12:27,430
Oh, yes. She was a very
famous black queen.

659
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:30,320
A powerful witch with a tremendous
talent for doing evil,

660
01:12:30,330 --> 01:12:32,250
A real mistress of magic.

661
01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:35,490
She lived and died in the city.
Did you know that?

662
01:12:35,980 --> 01:12:40,290
Yes. And might there exist
a guild of witches?

663
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:43,170
The correct term would
be a coven of witches.

664
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:46,060
A woman becomes queen of her magic
is a hundred times more powerful...

665
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:48,930
Than the rest of the coven,
which is like a serpent.

666
01:12:48,940 --> 01:12:52,770
Its strength rests with its leader--
That is, with its head.

667
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:56,610
A coven deprived of its leader
is like a headless cobra:

668
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:59,020
Harmless.

669
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:02,850
Skepticism is the natural
reaction of people nowadays,

670
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:05,750
But magic is ever present.

671
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:09,460
In other words:

672
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:16,650
Which means that magic is everywhere,

673
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:20,010
And all over the world,
it's a recognized fact.

674
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:23,060
Always.

675
01:13:36,470 --> 01:13:39,350
Mark? Mark?

676
01:13:47,510 --> 01:13:50,860
Excuse me. Where is everybody?

677
01:13:50,870 --> 01:13:55,180
They have all gone to the theater
for the opening of the Bolshoi.

678
01:13:55,190 --> 01:13:58,070
-Then why didn't anyone tell me about it?
-I don't know.

679
01:13:58,550 --> 01:14:01,910
Miss Tanner obtained
tickets for everyone.

680
01:14:06,230 --> 01:14:10,540
-Frank, this is Suzy. Sara's friend?
-Suzy? Hello?

681
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:12,950
-I can't--
-Talk louder. I can't hear you very well.

682
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:16,300
-Did something happen?
-Well, I haven't heard from Sara,

683
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:19,180
But a lot of strange
things are happening.

684
01:14:19,190 --> 01:14:22,420
I mean, for example,
when I eat at night, I--

685
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:25,530
Hello? Hello, Frank?

686
01:14:26,110 --> 01:14:28,870
Hello? Can you hear me?

687
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:31,650
Frank? Hello?

688
01:14:31,660 --> 01:14:34,860
Hello? Hello?

689
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:36,790
Hello?

690
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:41,600
Hello, Frank, can you hear me?

691
01:16:08,490 --> 01:16:11,370
No!

692
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:18,090
No!

693
01:17:55,470 --> 01:17:58,820
They don't leave the school at all.

694
01:17:58,830 --> 01:18:03,590
The front door is on the left. Their
footsteps are going to the right.

695
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:35,260
Two, three, four, five, six,

696
01:18:35,270 --> 01:18:38,120
Seven--

697
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:45,320
I can find out where they're
going by counting their footsteps.

698
01:19:54,930 --> 01:19:56,850
Twenty.

699
01:21:05,180 --> 01:21:07,580
Who's there?

700
01:21:48,230 --> 01:21:51,900
Carpet. That's why the
footsteps stop here.

701
01:22:09,590 --> 01:22:12,950
It's impossible. There's gotta
be another way out of here.

702
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:21,390
The secret--
I saw it behind the door!

703
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:24,640
Three Irises!
Turn the blue one!

704
01:23:25,950 --> 01:23:28,830
The secret--
I saw it behind the door!

705
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:31,480
Three Irises!
Turn the blue one!

706
01:26:16,220 --> 01:26:20,060
I told you: we must get rid of that
bitch of an american girl!

707
01:26:20,070 --> 01:26:25,240
Vanish--She must vanish! Make
her disappear, understand?

708
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:31,470
She won't eat or drink
anything this evening.

709
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:41,550
Vanish--She must vanish!

710
01:26:41,670 --> 01:26:44,550
She must die, die, die!

711
01:26:51,990 --> 01:26:54,390
Helena, give me power.

712
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:10,710
Sickness! Sickness!

713
01:27:11,190 --> 01:27:13,580
Away with her! Away with trouble!

714
01:27:13,590 --> 01:27:18,400
Death, death, death!

715
01:29:12,490 --> 01:29:15,370
Who is it? Who's there?

716
01:29:15,510 --> 01:29:20,300
I've been expecting you.
The American girl!

717
01:29:20,780 --> 01:29:23,660
I knew you'd come.

718
01:29:23,770 --> 01:29:28,460
You wanna kill me? You wanna
kill Helena Markos?

719
01:29:41,990 --> 01:29:45,820
You wanted to kill me.
You wanted to kill me!

720
01:29:45,830 --> 01:29:49,660
What are you going to do now, huh?

721
01:29:53,030 --> 01:29:56,150
Now death is coming for you!

722
01:29:58,180 --> 01:30:02,510
You wanted to kill Helena Markos!

723
01:30:04,660 --> 01:30:07,540
Hell is behind that door!

724
01:30:07,990 --> 01:30:10,870
You're going to meet death now!

725
01:30:11,780 --> 01:30:14,180
The living dead!

726
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:30,410
Witch, witch.
