"Episode 85"

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,640
My brother said he was
going to KJ Bar with Ha-na?

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,520
That's what he said.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,280
He didn't want me
to accompany him.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,600
They went public with
their dating.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,960
And I've been thinking of ways
to harass Ra-hee's family.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,280
This is it.

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,600
Should I torture them
with this?

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,240
Torture?

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,640
Are you talking about
physical torture?

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,960
No, psychological torture.

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,960
Hwang-so Soy Sauce
got its name back

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,680
Hwang-so Soy Sauce
got its name back?

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,520
KJ Bar?
Do-eun, it's late.

16
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,080
Why do you want to go there?

17
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,080
Do-hyeon?
He'll be there?

18
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,440
There he is.

19
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,080
They have undeniable chemistry!
It's explosive!

20
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,400
Don't you agree, Ra-gong?
What about you, Ra-hee?

21
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,480
Ra-hee.

22
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,200
Let go.

23
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,080
Ra-hee,
are you not feeling well?

24
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,840
Are you dizzy?
Or are you just shocked?

25
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,240
You're scary when you
look at me like that.

26
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,480
Ra-gong, I'm scared.

27
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,320
Stop her.

28
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,120
Ra-hee, don't make
yourself more pathetic.

29
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,320
Let's go.

30
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,200
Our date's ruined.

31
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,560
Ra-gong, you should
take Ra-hee home.

32
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,880
I want to go home too.

33
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,840
Come on.

34
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:34,440
When I first saw you here,
I wished you were a woman.

35
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,440
I wanted to dance with you.

36
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,320
I dreamed of a happy
ending with you.

37
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,800
A happy ending?

38
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,240
It wasn't a happy ending.

39
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,560
As I wished, you
really were a woman.

40
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,280
But there was a bigger
obstacle for us.

41
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,040
I got married and you're
at odds with my dad.

42
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,560
But one thing hasn't changed.

43
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,240
What's that?

44
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,560
I still love you the same.

45
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,360
I don't think about anything
else when I'm with you.

46
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,520
I don't think about you
being my dad's enemy.

47
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,480
I forget that I was married.

48
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,840
I only think about one thing.

49
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,200
It's that I love you.

50
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,920
I should go.

51
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,880
Thanks, Ha-na.

52
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,840
Thanks for the good memories.

53
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:24,320
I thank you too for helping me get
Hwang-so Soy Sauce's name back.

54
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,200
I heard the happy news that
Hwang-so got its name back.

55
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,680
I waited up to congratulate you.

56
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,720
Your cheeks are flushed.

57
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,400
You look like you're
happy and excited.

58
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,520
Where did you go?

59
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,720
Ha-na.

60
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,880
What?

61
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,960
Do-hyeon helped me get
Hwang-so Soy Sauce's name back.

62
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,640
I had a cocktail with him.
I'm going to go change.

63
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,840
Do you remember my telling you
about dopamine, norepinephrine,

64
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:50,640
neutrophin, testosterone,
oxytocin and endorphin?

65
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,040
The only time your body releases all
6 hormones is when you're in love.

66
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:05,560
Your behaviour today is similar
to how you behaved a year ago.

67
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,600
When we came back from living by
the beach, you had a frozen heart.

68
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,360
But today,
you seem like your old self

69
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,840
before we went to
live by the beach.

70
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:27,080
Did Do-hyeon melt
your frozen heart?

71
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,240
Do you love Do-hyeon still?

72
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,040
Do I still love him?

73
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,920
No.
I don't love him.

74
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,560
Do-hyeon and Ha-na have the
most chemistry I've ever seen

75
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,000
between two people.

76
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,360
I want them to make it legal.

77
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,680
What I mean by that is,
I'm going to get them married.

78
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,600
Ha-na and Do-hyeon
getting married...

79
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,920
Do-eun.

80
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,200
Yes?

81
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,440
You want them to get married?
Are you out of your stupid mind?

82
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,120
You startled me!
Why are you yelling at me?

83
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,880
And did you just call me stupid?
Mind your manners!

84
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,400
Don't forget, this is
your ex-husband's house!

85
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,880
How dare you yell
at me at my house!

86
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,440
It's only been a month since
Do-hyeon and I divorced.

87
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,280
This is just wrong.

88
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,880
Ra-hee.

89
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,520
How could you do this to me?

90
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,080
I saw you with Ha-na.

91
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,280
I couldn't go home after
seeing you two together.

92
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,120
Do you want to see me die?

93
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,360
How can you flaunt your
relationship with her?

94
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,720
I already announced that she
and I are going to get engaged.

95
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,880
Everyone knows she
and I are dating.

96
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,320
So what's wrong with
my being seen with her?

97
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,040
What's wrong in this picture
is you coming to my house.

98
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,040
It's only been a month since
I signed the divorce papers.

99
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,520
We just got divorced.

100
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,680
What does it matter how long
it's been when it's over?

101
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,520
It's not over for me.

102
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,160
That's right.
I haven't let go of you.

103
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,400
I only signed the divorce papers
because I thought I could work on

104
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,240
our reconciliation
after the divorce.

105
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,160
I didn't think our
marriage was really over!

106
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,480
All I want is you, Do-hyeon.

107
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,880
Can't you give me a chance?

108
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,360
You could give me a chance
considering the feelings we shared.

109
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,600
The feelings we shared?

110
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,160
I don't remember sharing
any feelings with you.

111
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,280
We were never really
husband and wife.

112
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:28,520
Were we ever man and wife even for a
day during our 6 months of marriage?

113
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,680
No, we weren't.

114
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,840
I thought I'd grow to love you
after marrying you like my dad said.

115
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,960
But it never happened.

116
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,160
You can't force yourself to
love someone and

117
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,320
you can't force yourself
to stop loving someone.

118
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,880
That's why our marriage ended.

119
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,840
We never had any love and
never shared any feelings.

120
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,360
They were never man and
wife during their marriage?

121
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,720
They were more like strangers
during their 6 months of marriage?

122
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,600
They had separate beds.

123
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,280
They never consummated
their marriage.

124
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:35,720
I'm saying there's nothing to stop
Do-hyeon and Ha-na.

125
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,360
I want them to get married.

126
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,880
You're getting ahead of yourself.
Yes, they're dating now.

127
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:48,000
But you can't predict the future.
I don't like that he was married.

128
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,560
He was someone else's husband.
Ha-na's never been married.

129
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,280
Ha-myung, don't be like that.
Be on my side.

130
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,760
They looked so good
together when they danced.

131
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,760
I recorded them dancing.

132
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,320
This was last night?

133
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,880
Yes, last night.

134
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,880
I even put it on the
company's Intranet.

135
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,560
You have anxiety?

136
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,280
Yes, Mom.
I think something will happen.

137
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,840
Ha-na decided to pretend to
date Do-hyeon for our safety.

138
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,960
But I think she's begun
to really like him.

139
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,400
Ha-na's cheeks were flushed

140
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,640
when she came home after
dancing with him last night.

141
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,120
Do-hyeon's sister wants him
and Ha-na to get married.

142
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:58,480
Mom, what if Ha-na
wants to marry Do-hyeon?

143
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:05,800
Should we let her or stop her?

144
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,880
Mr. Sul Jin-mok's a scary man.

145
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,480
It won't go that far.

146
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,760
Why?

147
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,520
Not everyone in love
ends up getting married.

148
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,640
And first love usually never lasts.

149
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,480
And it's no secret that our family
and Do-hyeon's are archenemies.

150
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:37,400
I want Ha-na to find out how she
really feels and find her true love.

151
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,000
Her true love?

152
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,920
Ms. Jang Ha-na?

153
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,480
Ms. Eun.

154
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,760
What is it?

155
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,920
It's Ms. Jang.

156
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,200
Why did you put it down?

157
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,160
You're both here.
I have a good idea.

158
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,440
I want to create a product called
Return of Hwang-so Soy Sauce and

159
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,200
let the consumers know
we got our name back.

160
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,600
I want to get the public's support
in getting the company stabilized.

161
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,080
We need more starter soy
sauce to create a new product.

162
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,960
And we don't have enough of it.

163
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,520
We have enough for the
first production,

164
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,560
but I'm worried about
the second production.

165
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,200
Yoon-chan, did something happen?

166
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,120
What?
Nothing.

167
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,000
Are you sure?

168
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,080
I'm listening.
Go on.

169
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,320
We have to make more soy sauce.

170
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:17,480
Every time we make a new soy sauce
at Hwang-so, we have a ceremony.

171
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,120
I should perform the ceremony

172
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,240
but I don't know if my grandpa
will allow me to do it.

173
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,120
Only men can perform Hwang-so's
ceremonies,

174
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,120
and only the first sons, right?

175
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,040
Yes.
That's why this is a problem.

176
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:39,840
Let's explain it to him and
convince him to give you permission.

177
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,400
What did you show up again?

178
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,760
I came to see my grandpa.

179
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,360
What?
This is not your house anymore!

180
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,840
You can't just keep coming here!

181
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,480
I'm glad you came, actually.

182
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,240
I let you go last time
without hurting you.

183
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,440
But this time, I'm
going to hurt you bad!

184
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,560
Chung-ran, Ra-gong!

185
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,600
What is it, Mom?

186
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,440
Hey, Jang Ha-na!

187
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,040
Why would you ever come here?

188
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,120
We have to beat her!

189
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,160
We have to beat her real
good so she won't come back!

190
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,280
Why, you little witch!

191
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,680
Get away from her.

192
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,800
Yoon-chan...

193
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,480
Who's this man?

194
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,360
He's pretty big...

195
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,600
Yoon-chan?

196
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,120
What are you doing here,
Yoon-chan?

197
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,040
I asked you to get away from her.

198
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,120
What?
I don't care that you're big!

199
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,720
Get out of my way!

200
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,640
We have to get back at her
for what she's done to us!

201
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,920
Mom, Grandma, don't.

202
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,560
Let go of me, Ra-gong!

203
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,640
Don't stop us, Ra-gong!

204
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,200
Mom, Grandma, just don't do it.

205
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,960
You'll regret it.

206
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,040
He's a gangster?

207
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,000
Yes.
You don't want to mess with him.

208
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,760
He beat me a few times.
You don't want to get him angry.

209
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,240
That witch Ha-na's engaged
to Do-hyeon

210
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,000
but she's working with that man?

211
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,920
He's Daichong's president?

212
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,080
How did that idiot girl
get so lucky?

213
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,720
She's got SS Group's vice chairman
as a boyfriend and

214
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,840
Daichong's president
as a business partner?

215
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,520
She must've saved a nation in her
previous life to get so lucky.

216
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,840
So how do we teach
her a lesson now?

217
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,600
Can we ever teach her a
lesson in my lifetime?

218
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,600
I heard you got Hwang-so
Soy Sauce's name back.

219
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,200
You did a good job.

220
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,400
Thank you.

221
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,840
I brought my partner Yoon-chan
with me to ask you something.

222
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,520
What is it?

223
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,320
Please give me your
permission for the ceremony.

224
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,880
The ceremony?

225
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,640
What Hwang-so Soy Sauce
needs to do now is

226
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,600
become independent from SS Group.

227
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,400
If it's not financially
stable in a month,

228
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,200
it will again go back to SS Group.

229
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,520
To be financially independent,
we have to create a new soy sauce.

230
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,360
We don't have enough of the
starter soy sauce in stock.

231
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,640
Please give us your permission
for the ceremony, Grandpa.

232
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,400
Who's going to perform it?

233
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,680
I'm the president, so I will do it.

234
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,920
I can't allow that.

235
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,600
You're a woman.

236
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,200
For the last 400 years, only
men have performed the ceremony.

237
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,640
As someone who knows
the tradition well,

238
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,160
how can you even ask such a thing?

239
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,560
Grandpa, I'm all for
following tradition.

240
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,880
But I believe you have
to learn to be flexible.

241
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,840
Hwang-so Soy Sauce is
in a crisis right now.

242
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,880
I won't allow it.

243
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,280
Tradition is tradition because

244
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,320
it's handed down from
generation to generation.

245
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,400
It wouldn't have any meaning if
it's something you can easily break.

246
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,920
Only men can be royal chefs.
Women can't be royal chefs.

247
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,960
I'm home.

248
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,680
This is not good.

249
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,880
What do we do if we
can't have the ceremony?

250
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,920
We need a new soy sauce to
be independent of SS Group.

251
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,760
We have to find a way.

252
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,200
Let's just go forward for now.

253
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,000
Let's just move on with our plan.

254
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,120
What do you mean?

255
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,120
Let's keep the public's interest up
by making a new soy sauce with

256
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,520
the starter soy sauce we have.

257
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,160
Let's find a way to make
more after we do that.

258
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,480
Okay.

259
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,000
I'll get Do-hyeon's
approval tomorrow.

260
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,320
Why don't we use SS Group's sales
network to sell our soy sauce?

261
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,280
We should sell our soy
sauce at SS Foods' stores.

262
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,640
We can do that since we're
SS Group's subsidiary.

263
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,080
That's a twist.

264
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,640
We're using SS Group
to our advantage.

265
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,440
Jang Ha-na's going to launch a new
product under Hwang-so name?

266
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,720
She's out to humiliate you, Father.

267
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,040
She wants everyone to know she got
the name back and that

268
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,560
she's going up against SS Group.

269
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,400
I'll handle this.

270
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It hurts my pride that
she's attacking us, Father.

271
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,160
Launch of Return of
Hwang-so Soy Sauce

272
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,480
Launch of Return of
Hwang-so Soy Sauce?

273
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,520
You want to humiliate SS Group?

274
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,640
You can't do that.

275
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,320
What are you doing?

276
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,400
I'm stopping you from
launching a new product.

277
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,840
As a board member,
I'm stopping you.

278
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,280
Stopping me on what grounds?

279
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,120
It didn't meet quality
control requirements.

280
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,000
Our product's top of the line.

281
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,720
That's to be seen.

282
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,280
SS Foods' research team
will review the product.

283
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,160
It takes at least a week.

284
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,200
See if you can sell it
after the review's done.

285
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,920
Too bad it'll be too late by then.

286
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,320
As a board member,
I have no choice

287
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,160
but to close the storage until
the review's completed.

288
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,600
You're being unreasonable.

289
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,640
That's right,
I'm being unreasonable.

290
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,000
You're Hwang-so Soy Sauce's
president and engaged to Do-hyeon!

291
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,520
Why do you get everything?

292
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,640
Why do I have to lose
everything to you?

293
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,400
I'll stop you like crazy.

294
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,560
I'll stop you every time
you attempt to do something.

295
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,760
See if you can do anything.

296
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,440
There's trouble.

297
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,360
There's an order to
close the storage.

298
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,200
Close the storage?
Why?

299
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,440
Jang Ra-hee did it to cause trouble
for Hwang-so Soy Sauce.

300
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,080
I think Mr. Sul Jin-mok's
supporting her.

301
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,480
I should go to Hwang-so Soy Sauce.

302
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,920
Ra-hee ordered the
storage to be closed?

303
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,200
I'm filing a formal complaint.

304
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:43,320
It's wrong of SS Group's board
member Jang Ra-hee to interfere in

305
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,920
my business for personal reasons.

306
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,000
I'll meet with her.

307
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,720
Do-hyeon.

308
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,360
I'll get right to the point.

309
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,760
You can't have Hwang-so
Soy Sauce's storage closed.

310
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,680
Did Ha-na tell you that?

311
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,160
She told on me?

312
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,960
This is not right.
Just cancel it.

313
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,040
How can you openly side
with her in front of me?

314
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,000
You're the one making me angrier.

315
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,520
The more you defend Ha-na,
the more jealous I get and

316
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,760
the more I want to
cause trouble for her!

317
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,840
Jealous?

318
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,080
What right do you
have to get jealous?

319
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,120
Who do you think you are?

320
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,840
I'm your ex-wife.

321
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,040
I was your wife until
just a month ago.

322
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,240
You didn't give me
time to get over you!

323
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,680
No one can criticize
me for my actions.

324
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,680
Everyone can understand my wanting
to stop your engagement and

325
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,360
come between you and Ha-na!

326
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,600
Going after someone who doesn't love
you is the kind of person you are?

327
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,440
Thanks for showing
me your true colours.

328
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,320
Now I don't even feel guilty
for having divorced you.

329
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,520
Do-hyeon.

330
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,720
If you're willing to play dirty,
I won't lose to you either.

331
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:08,400
You have my dad supporting you,
but I'm the company's vice chairman.

332
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,080
Let's see who wins.

333
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,640
SS Foods' research team
already went to the storage?

334
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,520
Yes.

335
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,000
I was about to report
it to Mr. Sul Do-hyeon.

336
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,120
Where's Ha-na?

337
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,000
She went to SS Group.

338
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,200
She said she'd turn her
phone off during the meeting.

339
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,520
Who are you?

340
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,480
You're not Hwang-so
Soy Sauce employees.

341
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,840
What are you doing?

342
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,320
We received an order to close the
storage from SS Foods research team.

343
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,280
Ms. Jang Ra-hee gave us an order
to transfer all the soy sauce to

344
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,520
SS Foods' research team.

345
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,720
Let's move everything all at once.
Let's see how much we have.

346
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,600
I won't let you do that.

347
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,240
Who are you?
Get out of our way.

348
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,520
I said I won't let you do that.

349
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,000
Just get out of my way!

350
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,160
Let go of her!

351
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,600
Are you okay, Ha-na?

352
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,680
We have to stop them.

353
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,440
We can't get the soy sauce back if
they take it to the research team.

354
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,520
Who are you?

355
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,280
Are you Mr. Sul,
the vice chairman?

356
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,160
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were involved.

357
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,720
I'm sorry.

358
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,160
Just leave.

359
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:01,960
All right.

360
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,040
But Ms. Jang Ra-hee gave us an
order to transfer everything here

361
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,160
to the research team.

362
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,360
I said leave!

363
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,200
All right.

364
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,160
All right, Young-ho.

365
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,400
More men will be coming
to take the soy sauce.

366
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,600
They'll arrive soon.

367
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,080
It'll take time for us to bring
the soy sauce back

368
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,480
if SS Foods takes
all the soy sauce.

369
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,040
I know it's just temporary,
but let's lock the door.

370
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,960
Let's wait until Hwang-so
Soy Sauce people arrive.

371
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,240
It's an emergency situation because
Ra-hee ordered the storage closed.

372
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,400
I can't get in touch
with Ms. Jang.

373
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,520
I think she went to the storage.

374
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,800
I want to go to the storage.

375
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,960
All right.

376
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,480
I'll have the driver
bring the car around.

377
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,160
What's wrong?

378
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,560
Are you worried
about the situation?

379
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,200
Actually, there's something
that worries me more.

380
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,240
Is it about Ms. Jang?

381
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,320
I keep thinking the same thing.

382
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,320
I'm always a step behind.

383
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,240
And that's making me nervous.

384
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:25,200
I have this feeling that maybe Ha-na
has someone else in her heart.

385
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,480
Who locked the door?

386
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,200
It shouldn't be locked.
What's going on?

387
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,200
Go to headquarters and
find out what's going on.

388
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:53,600
I'm glad I can help you
protect your products.

389
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,800
Will you be okay?

390
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,160
Thanks to you I can
sell my product,

391
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,000
but you'll be seen as a betrayer
in your father's eyes.

392
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,720
A betrayer?

393
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,160
What you did affects
SS Group's profits.

394
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,960
And you sided with me
in front of employees.

395
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,680
I'll be in trouble with my dad.

396
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,560
There's another issue.

397
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:35,000
But when you become SS Group's CEO,
this could come back to haunt you.

398
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,600
It could.

399
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,640
Don't you care?

400
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,360
It's not important to me.

401
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,640
Why are you smiling?

402
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,920
I like that you're
worried about me.

403
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,040
I'm not worried about you.

404
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,240
You're worried about me.

405
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,600
I'm just stating the facts.

406
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,680
Fine.

407
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,760
It's cold.
Let's put more cardboard on here.

408
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,080
What happened to your hand?

409
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,920
Blood... What happened?

410
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,240
You're hurt.
Why didn't you say anything?

411
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,320
It's okay.

412
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,080
It's not okay.
Are you kidding me?

413
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:38,040
What if you get a
tetanus infection?

414
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,680
It stopped bleeding.

415
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,840
So go to a hospital
when we get out.

416
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,240
How did you know what to do?

417
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,000
I pretended to be a
man for many years.

418
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:05,280
I got into a lot of fights
but couldn't go to a hospital.

419
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,240
I had to treat my wounds myself.

420
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,640
Ha-na.

421
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,200
Can I kiss you on the cheek?

422
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:03,080
Did Do-hyeon melt
your frozen heart?

423
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:08,160
Do you love Do-hyeon again?
