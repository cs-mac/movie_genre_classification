2
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:53,627
The Ninth Gate (1999)

3
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:28,537
It's an impressive collection.
You have some very rare editions here.

4
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:32,833
-Are you sure you wanna sell them all?
-They're no use to Father, not anymore.

5
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,210
Not since he's been this way.

6
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:39,590
His library was his whole world.
Now it's just a painful memory.

7
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,050
Unbearably painful.

8
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:45,220
I understand.

9
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:53,812
Well, at a rough preliminary estimate,
you have a collection here...

10
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,814
...worth around $600,000.

11
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,399
Six hundred thousand?

12
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,902
Yes, or thereabouts.

13
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:04,031
I've picked out one or two volumes
that merit special attention.

14
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:07,075
This Persiles, for example, is important.

15
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,452
I'd hang on to that.

16
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:10,996
It will never depreciate.
It's a good investment.

17
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:14,208
-Valuable?
-Very valuable.

18
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:21,089
As for this Hypnerotomachia Di Poliphili
by Colonna, Venice 1545...

19
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,218
...I'm sure I could find you a buyer.

20
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,679
But I wouldn't let the rest go
for less than $500,000...

21
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,265
...under any circumstances.

22
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,601
It may take a month to place them.

23
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,770
In the meantime,
I advise you to be patient.

24
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:36,730
-A month?
-Yes, a month or two.

25
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,982
It depends on how much
of a hurry you're in.

26
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:40,692
You see, more hurry, less money.

27
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,530
-Of course.
-Well, that's my advice anyway.

28
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,740
I'm sure you wouldn't
want to rush things...

29
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,284
...but please feel free
to consult another expert.

30
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,954
If you have any questions,
you know where to reach me.

31
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,459
Incidentally, this four-volume edition
of Don Quixote is quite nice...

32
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,461
...but not particularly valuable.

33
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:04,842
Now, I could take it off your hands...

34
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,386
...right away.

35
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,433
How much were you thinking of?

36
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:17,312
I couldn't go more
than 4000, 4200, tops.

37
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:19,773
Fine.

38
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:28,949
-You here?
-Hello, Witkin.

39
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,367
You didn't waste much time.

40
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:32,786
There's a small fortune in there,
help yourself.

41
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,038
You're a vulture, Corso. A vulture.

42
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:36,790
Who isn't, in our business?

43
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,166
You'd stoop to anything.

44
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,169
For a Quixote by Ybarra?
You bet I would.

45
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:43,547
Unscrupulous.
Thoroughly unscrupulous.

46
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,591
Happy hunting.

47
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:07,446
I just got off the phone with Witkin.

48
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:09,364
He's spitting blood.

49
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:12,534
Really? What's his problem?

50
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:17,372
He said you're a double-dealing,
money-grubbing bastard.

51
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:20,751
Thought he had that deal sewed up.

52
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,753
He said you queered his pitch.

53
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,422
Well, he should've been
quicker off the mark.

54
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:27,049
May I?

55
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:31,512
Sure. And he said your evaluation
was way over the top.

56
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,348
Got those people coming out in a rash.

57
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:37,976
Now they're asking twice
what those books are worth.

58
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:45,776
Let's face it, you screwed him.

59
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:47,819
-That's what it's called.
-Yes.

60
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,239
He also said
that you snatched the Don Qui--

61
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:01,875
Ybarra, Don Quixote, 1780.

62
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,753
All four volumes.

63
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:06,755
Son of a bitch.

64
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,757
Fantastic.

65
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:11,677
Fantastic. You are the best.

66
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:15,681
That client of yours, the Swiss,
you think he'd still be interested in this?

67
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:18,976
I have Witkin on my ass. I told him
I had no part of this operation.

68
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,853
Except 10 percent.

69
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:24,481
20 percent. The Swiss was my client.

70
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:27,609
-No deal.
-Fifteen, for my children's sake.

71
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:30,571
-You don't have any children.
-I'm still young, give me time.

72
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:33,407
Ten.

73
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:50,465
Hey, man, how you doing?
How about a couple of bucks?

74
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:53,594
Not today. Not today.

75
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,224
Hey.

76
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:17,951
And earlier, in 1580,
in De La Demonomanie Des Sorciers...

77
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,329
...by the Frenchman, Jean Bodin.

78
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:25,125
Bodin was probably the first
to attempt to establish a system...

79
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:29,379
...if the term 'system' may be applied
to the Middle Ages...

80
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:32,799
...for classifying
the contemporary perceptions of evil.

81
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:37,513
In Bodin, we find one of the first definitions
of the word 'witch.'

82
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,515
And I quote:

83
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:44,144
"A witch is a person who,
though cognizant of the laws of God...

84
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:48,649
...endeavors to act through
the medium of a pact with the devil."

85
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:52,194
To assist them in their work,
many witches kept familiars.

86
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:55,197
That is to say,
creatures such as cats or toads...

87
00:10:55,364 --> 00:11:00,035
...in which supernatural spirits or demons
were thought to reside.

88
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:03,413
For those of you ladies and gentlemen
who wish to delve more deeply...

89
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,874
...into the controversial subject
of witchcraft...

90
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:10,087
...a great deal of relevant information
may be found in the following works:

91
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:13,215
Nicolas Remes' Demonolattia Libri...

92
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:18,554
...and Compendium Maleficarum
by Francesco Maria Guazzo.

93
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:31,775
I see you were stimulated
by my little talk, Mr. Corso.

94
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:37,114
-Did I snore?
-Well, it's nice of you to ask.

95
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:40,284
No. Not that I noticed.

96
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,493
Shall we go?

97
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:52,212
Don't you sleep nights?

98
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,090
-Like a baby.
-Strange.

99
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:57,301
I'd have bet a brace
of Gutenberg Bibles...

100
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:00,220
...you spend half the night
with your eyes peeled.

101
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:03,056
You're one of those lean,
hungry, restless types...

102
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,517
...that put the wind up Julius Caesar.

103
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:08,979
Men who stab their friends in the back.

104
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:15,444
Not, I suspect, that you have many friends,
do you, Mr. Corso?

105
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:17,613
Your kind seldom does.

106
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,115
That makes woo of us.

107
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,498
You're right, of course.

108
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:31,376
Your friendships don't concern me
in the least.

109
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:35,255
Our relations have always been strictly
commercial and that's the way I like it.

110
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:38,300
The professional and the personal
should be mutually exclusive.

111
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:41,970
Listen, I came here to do some business,
not shoot the breeze.

112
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:44,473
If you wanna expound
your personal philosophies...

113
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,766
...write another book.

114
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:48,435
-You don't like me, do you?
-I don't have to like you.

115
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,729
You're a client and you pay well.

116
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,579
You're privileged, Mr. Corso.

117
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:09,998
Very few people ever set foot in here.

118
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:12,918
This is my private collection.

119
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,839
Some bibliophiles specialize
in gothic novels...

120
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:19,174
...others in books of hours.

121
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:22,845
All my own rare editions
have the same protagonist.

122
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,012
The devil.

123
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:26,265
-May I take a look?
-Yes.

124
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,642
It's why I brought you here.

125
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:46,451
Beautiful, aren't they?

126
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:50,789
The soft sheen, the superb gilding.

127
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:53,834
Not to mention the centuries of wisdom
they contain.

128
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:57,296
I know people who would kill
for a collection like this.

129
00:13:57,546 --> 00:14:00,007
The Ars Diavoli.

130
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:04,511
You'll never see as many books
on the subject anywhere else in the world.

131
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:07,556
They're the rarest,
the choicest editions in existence.

132
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:10,684
It's taken me a lifetime
to assemble them.

133
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:14,146
Only the supreme masterpiece
was missing.

134
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:15,814
Come.

135
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:26,533
The Nine Gates
of the Kingdom of Shadows.

136
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,493
-You're familiar with it?
-Yes.

137
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,787
Venice, 1666.

138
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:35,250
The author and printer, Aristide Torchia,
was burned by the holy Inquisition...

139
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:37,544
...together with all his works.

140
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,713
Only three copies survived.

141
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,881
One.

142
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:43,759
Catalog lists three copies surviving
in private ownership:

143
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:46,512
-Fargas, the Kessler and the Telfer.
-It's true.

144
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:49,515
You know your business,
but you're mistaken nonetheless.

145
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:52,601
According to my own research,
only one is authentic.

146
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:54,978
Well, three are known.

147
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:57,022
That's the trouble.

148
00:14:57,523 --> 00:14:58,774
Where'd you get it?

149
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:01,109
I bought it from Telfer.

150
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:03,779
-Telfer?
-Yes, he finally sold it to me.

151
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:06,490
The day before he killed himself.

152
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,076
It's good timing.

153
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:23,632
-Silence is golden.
-Precisely.

154
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:26,426
Ever heard of the Delomelanicon?

155
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:29,721
I've heard of it, yes. It's a myth, isn't it?

156
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:32,307
A book reputed to have been written
by Satan himself.

157
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:33,600
No myth.

158
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,269
That book existed.

159
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,063
Torchia actually acquired it.

160
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:43,360
The engravings you are now admiring
were adapted...

161
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:46,530
...by Torchia from the Delomelanicon.

162
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:50,075
They form a kind of satanic riddle.

163
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:52,911
Correctly interpreted
with the aid of the original text...

164
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:54,913
...and sufficient inside information...

165
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,418
...they're reputed to conjure up
the prince of darkness in person.

166
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:01,628
You don't say.

167
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:04,506
Are you a religious man, Mr. Corso?

168
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:07,718
I mean, do you believe
in the supernatural?

169
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:10,929
I believe in my percentage.

170
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:15,058
Don't you get dizzy standing there?

171
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:21,398
What is it that you want
from me, Balkan?

172
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:29,489
I want you to go to Europe
and investigate.

173
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,075
The other two copies are
in Portugal and France.

174
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:35,162
I want you to find some way
of comparing them with mine.

175
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:38,457
Every page, every engraving,
the binding, everything.

176
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:41,376
I'm convinced only one is authentic.
I wanna know which.

177
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:43,045
That could be an expensive trip.

178
00:16:45,214 --> 00:16:46,965
That's to get you started.

179
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:49,134
Spend what you need.

180
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:52,846
What if I find that your copy's a forgery?

181
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,890
It's quite possible.

182
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:56,600
Really?

183
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,145
It doesn't appear to be.

184
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:06,151
-Even the paper sounds kosher.
-Even so.

185
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:09,571
-There's something wrong.
-You mean the devil won't show up?

186
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:16,036
If all three copies turn out to be bogus
or incomplete your work will be done.

187
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:18,997
If, on the other hand,
one of them turns out to be genuine...

188
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:20,582
...I'll finance you further.

189
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:25,379
I want you to get it for me,
at all costs, never mind how.

190
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:28,465
-"Never mind how" sounds illegal.
-Wouldn't be the first time...

191
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:30,259
...you've done something illegal.

192
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:34,096
-Not that illegal.
-Hence the size of the check.

193
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:41,812
Do a good job, I'll double it.

194
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:47,985
Gotta be something wrong with it
if you're letting it out of your hands.

195
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:50,112
I have the utmost faith in you,
Mr. Corso.

196
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:53,949
Nothing more reliable than a man whose
loyalty can be bought for hard cash.

197
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:56,512
Good morning, I'm Dean Corso.

198
00:18:56,678 --> 00:19:00,891
I'm terribly sorry to disturb you
at a time like this.

199
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:15,489
It would be very helpful, ma'am,
if you could tell me what you know...

200
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:17,699
...about this book.

201
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:29,419
-Isn't this one of my husband's books?
-Right.

202
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:33,549
It was in his collection until very recently.
He sold it to a client of mine.

203
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:35,133
I'm trying to authenticate it.

204
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,261
He sold it, you say?

205
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:40,055
Strange. This was one of
his most treasured possessions.

206
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:42,099
-He never mentioned the sale?
-No.

207
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:44,226
It's news to me.

208
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:45,853
Who bought it?

209
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:48,146
A private collector.

210
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:49,690
May I know his name?

211
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:52,651
I'm afraid that's confidential.

212
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:54,903
I suppose he has a bill of sale?

213
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,281
-No problem there.
-Is this your job?

214
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,366
Authenticating rare books?

215
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:02,035
And tracking them down, yes.

216
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:03,537
You're a book detective.

217
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:05,414
Kind of.

218
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:09,710
Do you recall when and where
your husband acquired this book?

219
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:13,714
In Spain.

220
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:16,258
We were vacationing at Toledo.

221
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:18,635
Andrew got very excited.

222
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:21,430
He paid a great deal of money for it.

223
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:24,099
He was a fanatical collector.

224
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:26,226
So I gather.

225
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,729
I'll show you.

226
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,126
It's impressive.

227
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:54,838
Andrew used to spend many hours
in here.

228
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:57,049
Too many.

229
00:20:57,216 --> 00:20:58,967
Did he ever try it out?

230
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,637
I don't understand.

231
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:03,138
The book.

232
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:05,724
Did he ever use it to perform
some kind of ritual...

233
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:08,977
...intended to produce
a supernatural effect?

234
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:10,562
Are you serious?

235
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:12,731
Yes, absolutely.

236
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:16,318
Andrew was a trifle eccentric,
Mr. Corso...

237
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:18,487
...but he wasn't insane.

238
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:20,948
It's true he'd been acting...

239
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:25,452
...strangely those last few days.
He shut himself up in here.

240
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:29,331
He seldom emerged except for meals.

241
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:32,167
That morning, I was awoken...

242
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:34,837
...by the screams of the maid.

243
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:40,342
He'd hanged himself.

244
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:44,930
Whatever he was up to...

245
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:49,852
...I certainly can't see him chanting
mumbo jumbo or trying to raise the dead.

246
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:52,896
The devil, Mrs. Telfer.

247
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:54,982
This book is designed to raise the devil.

248
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,583
Thus let the light shine.

249
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:54,096
Son of a bitch. Where did you get this?

250
00:25:54,263 --> 00:25:55,597
Balkan.

251
00:25:55,764 --> 00:25:57,975
Wants me to research it.

252
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,477
Balkan owns a Nine Gates?

253
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:03,772
Recently acquired
from the late lamented Andrew Telfer.

254
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:05,315
Trust Balkan.

255
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:08,861
What does he need you for?
I don't suppose he plans to sell it.

256
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:11,738
He wants me to compare it
with the two surviving copies...

257
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:13,782
...which are in Portugal and France.

258
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:17,703
-So I'm off to Europe.
-Compare it?

259
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:21,623
Yeah. Only one of three's authentic,
he says.

260
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,626
Well, this looks genuine enough.

261
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:27,421
Christ, it's gotta be worth a million.

262
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:30,716
-Take care of it.
-That's why I'm here.

263
00:26:30,883 --> 00:26:32,301
I need you to stash it for me.

264
00:26:33,302 --> 00:26:35,512
-Because I'm starting to see things.
-Like what?

265
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,807
Uninvited visitors, unfamiliar faces.

266
00:26:38,974 --> 00:26:41,977
I don't trust anyone, not even Balkan.

267
00:26:42,144 --> 00:26:44,605
Come to think of it,
I'm not even sure I trust you.

268
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:47,774
You know I wouldn't screw you
unless there was a good reason.

269
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:52,112
Money, women, business.
Other than that, you can relax.

270
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:55,782
-I'll pick it up on my way to the airport.
-Sure.

271
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,327
These engravings are terrific.

272
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:01,538
Or horrific, whichever.

273
00:27:01,705 --> 00:27:05,709
Sensational. Absolutely sensational.

274
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,671
May I come in?

275
00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:02,057
Please, sit down.

276
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,729
I've come to talk business.

277
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:13,402
Yesterday, when you came to see me
about that book...

278
00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:17,656
...I was too surprised to react
as I should've done.

279
00:28:17,823 --> 00:28:20,325
I mean, it really was one
of Andrew's favorites.

280
00:28:21,076 --> 00:28:22,452
So you said.

281
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:24,746
I'd like to get it back.

282
00:28:26,415 --> 00:28:29,251
-That could be a problem.
-Not necessarily. It all depends.

283
00:28:29,418 --> 00:28:32,254
-On what?
-On you.

284
00:28:32,421 --> 00:28:36,425
I don't understand, Mrs. Telfer.
The book is not mine to dispose of.

285
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:46,727
You work for money, I take it?

286
00:28:46,894 --> 00:28:48,937
-What else?
-I have a great deal of money.

287
00:28:49,104 --> 00:28:51,857
-I'm very happy for you.
-You could stage a theft.

288
00:28:52,024 --> 00:28:54,735
I imagine your client is well insured.

289
00:28:54,902 --> 00:28:57,446
-I'm a professional, ma'am.
-A professional mercenary.

290
00:28:57,613 --> 00:29:01,617
-Mercenaries work for the highest bidder.
-I make a living.

291
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:03,452
I could throw in a bonus.

292
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:08,707
-This has happened before someplace.
-I know. In the movies.

293
00:29:08,874 --> 00:29:11,543
And she had an automatic
in her stocking.

294
00:29:15,297 --> 00:29:17,174
No automatic.

295
00:29:26,475 --> 00:29:29,311
-Would you like a drink?
-Why not?

296
00:31:00,861 --> 00:31:03,155
Okay, where is it?

297
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:04,865
Where's what?

298
00:31:05,324 --> 00:31:07,868
Don't fuck with me.

299
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:11,413
I thought I already did.

300
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,252
Wait. No, no, wait, wait, wait.

301
00:31:17,836 --> 00:31:19,421
Take it easy. Wait.

302
00:31:42,486 --> 00:31:44,279
You have reached
Bernie's Rare Books.

303
00:31:44,446 --> 00:31:47,616
Please leave your message
after the beep.

304
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:51,286
Bernie, you there?

305
00:31:52,371 --> 00:31:53,872
Pick up.

306
00:31:56,959 --> 00:31:58,544
Bernie.

307
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,820
Give me a minute, I won't be long.

308
00:32:24,987 --> 00:32:28,615
-You can take me on to Kennedy.
-No problem, sir.

309
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:57,102
Bernie?

310
00:33:00,272 --> 00:33:01,857
Bernie.

311
00:33:03,525 --> 00:33:05,444
Oh, Jesus.

312
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:23,545
Jesus Christ.

313
00:33:32,221 --> 00:33:33,805
Bernie.

314
00:34:24,565 --> 00:34:26,441
No problem?

315
00:35:02,644 --> 00:35:03,979
Stop.

316
00:35:04,146 --> 00:35:07,858
-Stop at that phone booth. Pull over.
-No problem, sir.

317
00:35:13,655 --> 00:35:16,408
He isn't available at this time.
May I know who's calling?

318
00:35:16,575 --> 00:35:18,827
-Dean Corso.
-Would you like to leave a message?

319
00:35:18,994 --> 00:35:21,455
No. I have to talk with him at once.

320
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:23,081
Oh, I'm afraid he's in transit.

321
00:35:23,248 --> 00:35:26,293
Give me your number, I'll have him return
when he checks with us.

322
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,337
No. I am at a phone booth.

323
00:35:28,504 --> 00:35:30,047
It's an emergency.

324
00:35:30,214 --> 00:35:32,090
I have to speak with him right now.

325
00:35:32,257 --> 00:35:35,302
Right now, do you hear me? Right now.

326
00:35:36,303 --> 00:35:38,055
One moment.

327
00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:56,865
-Jesus Christ.
-Are you there, Mr. Corso?

328
00:35:57,032 --> 00:35:59,576
-Yes.
-I'll patch you through.

329
00:36:03,288 --> 00:36:05,123
Mr. Corso, what have you got for me?

330
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:08,043
-More than I bargained for.
-What do you mean?

331
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:11,880
I mean I quit. I wanna return the book.
Where are you?

332
00:36:12,047 --> 00:36:14,424
I'm disappointed in you, Mr. Corso.

333
00:36:14,591 --> 00:36:16,510
You never let me down before.

334
00:36:16,677 --> 00:36:18,846
Well, this is different.

335
00:36:19,012 --> 00:36:21,598
-You remember Bernie Ornstein?
-Ornstein?

336
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:23,225
-Yeah.
-The dealer?

337
00:36:23,392 --> 00:36:27,771
I gave him your book to stash for me,
and now he's dead. Murdered.

338
00:36:27,938 --> 00:36:29,398
Because of the book?

339
00:36:29,565 --> 00:36:31,400
What else?

340
00:36:32,568 --> 00:36:35,654
Well, I never said it would be easy.
If it's a question of money--

341
00:36:35,821 --> 00:36:37,364
It isn't the money. I want out.

342
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:39,908
This matter means a great deal to me,
Mr. Corso.

343
00:36:40,075 --> 00:36:42,244
I'm not an ungenerous man,
you know that.

344
00:36:42,411 --> 00:36:46,415
Proceed as arranged and you can
tack another zero onto your fee.

345
00:36:46,582 --> 00:36:48,792
Final call for passengers
traveling to Paris....

346
00:36:48,959 --> 00:36:52,713
Hey, where are you, Balkan?

347
00:36:54,298 --> 00:36:56,049
Balkan?

348
00:37:49,603 --> 00:37:52,648
-Do you speak English?
-Yes, I do.

349
00:37:53,398 --> 00:37:56,193
I would like to get your opinion on this.

350
00:38:07,246 --> 00:38:10,165
What a habit for a bookbinder.

351
00:38:10,499 --> 00:38:12,918
The Nine Gates, superb edition.

352
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:16,088
Very rare. The Telfer copy.

353
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:19,049
Yes. You used to own it, right?

354
00:38:19,216 --> 00:38:20,425
-We used to, yes.
-Sold it.

355
00:38:20,592 --> 00:38:23,011
We sold it when the opportunity
presented itself.

356
00:38:23,178 --> 00:38:25,347
-It was too good to--
-Too good to miss.

357
00:38:25,514 --> 00:38:27,808
-An excellent sale.
-An excellent buy.

358
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:30,769
-Impeccable condition.
-Impeccable.

359
00:38:30,936 --> 00:38:34,022
-Are you the present owner?
-No. A client of mine.

360
00:38:34,189 --> 00:38:37,818
I would never have believed
she would part with it, never.

361
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:40,028
-She?
-Mrs. Telfer.

362
00:38:42,906 --> 00:38:45,868
I understood that it was
Mr. Telfer that had bought it.

363
00:38:46,034 --> 00:38:47,536
He paid for it.

364
00:38:47,703 --> 00:38:49,705
It was Mrs. Telfer who made him buy it.

365
00:38:49,872 --> 00:38:52,708
-He didn't seem particularly--
-Interested.

366
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:56,044
An exceptional specimen.

367
00:38:56,211 --> 00:38:58,630
-Do you think it could be a forgery?
-Forgery?

368
00:38:58,797 --> 00:39:01,717
-You hear that, Pablo?
-I took you for a professional.

369
00:39:01,884 --> 00:39:05,053
-You speak too lightly of forgeries.
-Far too lightly.

370
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:08,140
Forging a book is very expensive.

371
00:39:08,307 --> 00:39:12,561
Paper of the period, right inks.
Too expensive to be profitable.

372
00:39:12,728 --> 00:39:14,521
-Still, it can be done.
-Of course.

373
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:17,566
Requires a great skill,
but, yes, it can be done.

374
00:39:17,733 --> 00:39:19,735
Do you think
that could be the case here?

375
00:39:19,902 --> 00:39:20,903
What makes you ask?

376
00:39:21,069 --> 00:39:25,073
My client wishes to satisfy himself
on the book's authenticity.

377
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,243
His name is Balkan.
Boris Balkan of New York.

378
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:32,331
-All books have a destiny of their own.
-And a life of their own.

379
00:39:32,497 --> 00:39:36,460
Mr. Balkan is a celebrated collector.
He's no fool.

380
00:39:36,627 --> 00:39:38,420
He must know this book
is authentic.

381
00:39:38,587 --> 00:39:40,172
-We know it.
-So must he.

382
00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:42,549
-We had this book for years.
-Many years.

383
00:39:42,716 --> 00:39:45,260
And ample opportunity
to study it thoroughly.

384
00:39:45,427 --> 00:39:48,555
The printing, the binding
are magnificent examples...

385
00:39:48,722 --> 00:39:50,682
...of 17th century
Venetian craftsmanship.

386
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:55,354
Finest rag paper,
resistant to the passage of time.

387
00:39:55,521 --> 00:39:57,814
None of your modern wood pulp.

388
00:39:57,981 --> 00:40:01,902
Watermarks, ink, typefaces.

389
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:05,614
If this is a forgery,
or a copy with missing pages restored...

390
00:40:05,781 --> 00:40:07,282
...it's the work of a master.

391
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:09,284
-A master.
-Yes.

392
00:40:09,451 --> 00:40:11,620
Have you studied the engravings?

393
00:40:11,787 --> 00:40:14,456
They seem to have
some underlying significance.

394
00:40:14,623 --> 00:40:17,376
But of course. Here, for example.

395
00:40:17,543 --> 00:40:19,795
This one could be interpreted
as a warning.

396
00:40:19,962 --> 00:40:25,217
"Venture too far," it seems to say, "and
danger will descend on you from above."

397
00:40:25,384 --> 00:40:28,220
These type of books
often contain little puzzles.

398
00:40:28,387 --> 00:40:31,765
Especially in the case
of such an illustrious collaborator.

399
00:40:31,932 --> 00:40:32,933
Collaborator?

400
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,478
You could not have proceeded
very far in your research, senor.

401
00:40:36,645 --> 00:40:38,146
Here, look close.

402
00:40:38,313 --> 00:40:40,816
Now, you see?
Only six of the nine engravings...

403
00:40:40,983 --> 00:40:42,734
...were signed by Aristide Torchia.

404
00:40:42,901 --> 00:40:45,946
Yes. And the other three?

405
00:40:46,113 --> 00:40:48,073
This is one of them.

406
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:51,326
"LCF."

407
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:54,746
-Who's LCF?
-Think.

408
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:02,796
Lucifer?

409
00:41:03,547 --> 00:41:07,050
Very perceptive of you, senor.

410
00:41:07,676 --> 00:41:10,345
Torchia was burned alive
because he wrote this book...

411
00:41:10,512 --> 00:41:12,306
...in collaboration with someone else.

412
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:14,224
Come on. You can't honestly believe--

413
00:41:14,391 --> 00:41:18,103
The man who wrote this book
did so in alliance with the devil...

414
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:19,730
...and went to the stake for it.

415
00:41:19,897 --> 00:41:23,358
Even hell has its heroes, senor.

416
00:43:17,806 --> 00:43:19,308
I've seen you before.

417
00:43:19,474 --> 00:43:22,019
-Have you?
-Yes.

418
00:43:22,186 --> 00:43:24,479
Are you traveling in this car?

419
00:43:24,646 --> 00:43:27,149
-The next one.
-The sleeper.

420
00:43:27,316 --> 00:43:29,735
I travel on the cheap.

421
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:32,196
You're a student?

422
00:43:32,362 --> 00:43:34,573
Something like that.

423
00:43:34,823 --> 00:43:38,493
-I like trains.
-Trains I'm on?

424
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,662
Just trains.

425
00:43:43,207 --> 00:43:44,666
What's your name?

426
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:46,502
Guess.

427
00:43:48,086 --> 00:43:50,214
-Green eyes--
-That'll do.

428
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,841
-What's yours?
-Corso.

429
00:43:53,008 --> 00:43:54,927
Strange name.

430
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,471
Italian. It means "run."

431
00:43:57,638 --> 00:43:59,765
You don't look like a runner to me.

432
00:43:59,932 --> 00:44:01,433
More the quiet type.

433
00:44:05,812 --> 00:44:09,441
Well, give my regards to Balkan.

434
00:44:09,608 --> 00:44:12,819
-Tell him I'm doing my best.
-Balkan?

435
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,988
Never mind.

436
00:44:15,155 --> 00:44:17,157
See you around.

437
00:44:17,407 --> 00:44:19,159
Maybe.

438
00:44:20,202 --> 00:44:22,579
I wouldn't be surprised.

439
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:04,640
Yes, Dean Corso, Mr. Fargas.

440
00:46:04,806 --> 00:46:09,061
Corso? Oh, yes. Please, come in.

441
00:46:09,228 --> 00:46:10,896
Thank you.

442
00:46:15,943 --> 00:46:17,528
Please.

443
00:46:22,407 --> 00:46:24,493
Home, sweet home.

444
00:46:28,038 --> 00:46:30,707
You won't say no to a brandy, I take it?

445
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:33,043
Thank you very much.

446
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,100
Thank you.

447
00:46:49,351 --> 00:46:51,353
What handsome glasses.

448
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,939
They're the only ones I have left.

449
00:46:54,523 --> 00:46:56,024
Thanks.

450
00:46:57,734 --> 00:47:00,863
-Must've been a beautiful place.
-It was.

451
00:47:01,029 --> 00:47:04,074
But old families
are like ancient civilizations...

452
00:47:04,241 --> 00:47:06,493
...they wither and die.

453
00:47:09,413 --> 00:47:13,166
There they are, 834 our of them.

454
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:16,086
A pity you didn't see them
in better times.

455
00:47:16,253 --> 00:47:17,462
I used to have 5000.

456
00:47:18,046 --> 00:47:20,507
But these are the survivors.

457
00:47:20,674 --> 00:47:22,885
So this is the Fargas collection?

458
00:47:23,051 --> 00:47:25,888
Not quite as I imagined it, I must say.

459
00:47:26,054 --> 00:47:27,556
C´est la vie, my friend.

460
00:47:27,723 --> 00:47:32,644
But I keep them in perfect condition.
Safe from damp, light, heat, rats.

461
00:47:32,811 --> 00:47:34,730
I dust and air them every day.

462
00:47:39,902 --> 00:47:42,237
These are the occult.

463
00:47:42,404 --> 00:47:44,072
What do you think?

464
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:46,366
-Not bad.
-Not bad indeed.

465
00:47:46,533 --> 00:47:49,036
At least 10 of them are extremely rare.
Here.

466
00:47:49,203 --> 00:47:52,080
Plancy's Dictionnaire Infernal.

467
00:47:53,248 --> 00:47:56,335
First edition, 1844.

468
00:47:58,921 --> 00:48:04,176
Leonardo Fioravanti's
Compendio de Secreti, 1571.

469
00:48:09,223 --> 00:48:11,141
And there it is.

470
00:48:11,391 --> 00:48:13,519
In perfect condition.

471
00:48:17,439 --> 00:48:20,150
It has traveled the
world for three and a half centuries...

472
00:48:20,317 --> 00:48:22,861
...yet it might've been printed yesterday.

473
00:48:23,445 --> 00:48:26,865
Is it in order? I mean, you haven't
detected anything unusual?

474
00:48:27,032 --> 00:48:30,452
Unusual? No.
The text is complete, the engravings too.

475
00:48:30,619 --> 00:48:33,455
Nine, plus the title page,
just as the catalog states...

476
00:48:33,622 --> 00:48:37,626
...just like Kessler in Paris
and Telfer in New York.

477
00:48:37,793 --> 00:48:40,629
Yes. It isn't the Telfer anymore.

478
00:48:40,796 --> 00:48:42,464
Telfer killed himself.

479
00:48:42,631 --> 00:48:46,051
But he sold his copy
to Boris Balkan first.

480
00:48:46,218 --> 00:48:48,136
Balkan.

481
00:48:48,303 --> 00:48:51,223
If he sets his heart on a book,
no price is too high.

482
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:53,642
Not that I would ever sell this one.

483
00:48:53,809 --> 00:48:55,435
Not at any price.

484
00:48:56,854 --> 00:48:58,772
It's....

485
00:48:59,147 --> 00:49:01,275
It's strange that he
should've sent you here...

486
00:49:01,441 --> 00:49:04,027
...if he already had....

487
00:49:05,571 --> 00:49:07,447
You have it here?

488
00:49:08,365 --> 00:49:10,200
May I see it?

489
00:49:28,886 --> 00:49:31,013
Superb.

490
00:49:35,517 --> 00:49:37,519
Beautiful.

491
00:49:38,103 --> 00:49:39,188
Identical.

492
00:49:39,771 --> 00:49:41,857
Two of the only three
to escape the flames...

493
00:49:42,024 --> 00:49:45,444
...reunited for the first time
in over three centuries.

494
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:48,363
Yes.

495
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:50,699
Look at this slight imperfection here.

496
00:49:50,866 --> 00:49:52,701
The damaged S.

497
00:49:52,868 --> 00:49:55,787
The same type, the same impression.

498
00:49:56,538 --> 00:49:58,373
Incredible.

499
00:50:00,709 --> 00:50:03,212
You see,
if it weren't for this slight discoloration...

500
00:50:03,378 --> 00:50:06,882
...on the back of your copy,
no one could tell them apart.

501
00:50:07,132 --> 00:50:11,720
If you don't mind, I'd like to stay for a while
and examine them in detail.

502
00:50:14,806 --> 00:50:17,559
What are you looking for, Mr. Corso?

503
00:50:17,726 --> 00:50:19,728
I'm not quite sure.

504
00:50:19,895 --> 00:50:24,066
Some books are dangerous.
Not to be opened with impunity.

505
00:50:24,525 --> 00:50:25,651
That's very true.

506
00:51:00,936 --> 00:51:03,272
I'll be damned.

507
00:54:04,453 --> 00:54:05,871
Hello again.

508
00:54:06,538 --> 00:54:09,291
-You didn't say you were bound for Sintra.
-Neither did you.

509
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:12,377
-What are you doing here?
-Reading.

510
00:54:12,544 --> 00:54:15,380
-I can see that.
-And bumping into people.

511
00:54:15,547 --> 00:54:17,049
Unexpectedly.

512
00:54:17,216 --> 00:54:19,635
Yes. Unexpectedly is right.

513
00:54:20,969 --> 00:54:22,930
Are you on a business trip?

514
00:54:23,096 --> 00:54:25,974
Is that why you always carry
that thing around?

515
00:54:31,563 --> 00:54:34,149
-Is this part of your course?
-My course?

516
00:54:34,316 --> 00:54:36,985
Winning friends and influencing people.

517
00:54:37,152 --> 00:54:39,738
-You said you were a student.
-Did I?

518
00:54:39,947 --> 00:54:43,116
So I am. In a way.

519
00:54:44,076 --> 00:54:45,827
I like books.

520
00:54:45,994 --> 00:54:47,621
Do you?

521
00:54:50,749 --> 00:54:53,710
-Have you been traveling long?
-A while.

522
00:54:54,336 --> 00:54:56,588
I don't suppose you
ever travel by motorbike.

523
00:54:56,755 --> 00:54:59,091
Excuse me, senhor.

524
00:54:59,258 --> 00:55:01,009
For me? You're sure?

525
00:55:07,766 --> 00:55:09,601
The phone, sir.

526
00:55:09,768 --> 00:55:11,854
-Yes?
-Mr. Corso?

527
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:14,314
My God. How'd you find me?

528
00:55:14,481 --> 00:55:15,983
Made any progress?

529
00:55:16,149 --> 00:55:18,861
Progress? Yeah, you could call it that.

530
00:55:19,027 --> 00:55:20,696
Well?

531
00:55:20,863 --> 00:55:24,241
I can't talk here, I'm in the lobby.
Let me call you back. Where are you?

532
00:55:24,408 --> 00:55:27,578
Never mind that. Get them
to transfer it to your room, I'll wait.

533
00:55:27,744 --> 00:55:29,204
All right.

534
00:55:29,997 --> 00:55:33,041
Senhor, pardon me. Could you
send this up to my room, please?

535
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:34,293
-Yes.
-Thank you.

536
00:55:44,303 --> 00:55:46,138
-Still there?
-Yes.

537
00:55:46,305 --> 00:55:47,306
All right.

538
00:55:47,472 --> 00:55:49,266
I've examined the Fargas copy.

539
00:55:49,433 --> 00:55:51,727
It's authentic enough,
at least it looks that way.

540
00:55:51,894 --> 00:55:54,980
It's like yours,
but there are discrepancies.

541
00:55:55,147 --> 00:55:57,065
Discrepancies?

542
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:00,736
The engravings, they're not identical.

543
00:56:00,903 --> 00:56:02,946
It's, like, keys in different hands...

544
00:56:03,113 --> 00:56:06,158
...doorways open in one copy
and bricked up in the other.

545
00:56:06,325 --> 00:56:08,285
-And there's another thing.
-Yes.

546
00:56:08,452 --> 00:56:10,370
Yes, go on.

547
00:56:10,537 --> 00:56:15,792
Ones that differ aren't signed "Torchia."
They're signed "LCF."

548
00:56:18,003 --> 00:56:19,713
-Still there?
-LCF?

549
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,423
Listen, where are you, anyway?

550
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:24,343
I must have that copy, Mr. Corso.

551
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:26,428
Get it for me.

552
00:56:27,221 --> 00:56:30,599
The old man wouldn't sell it
to save his life. He said as much.

553
00:56:30,766 --> 00:56:32,434
Did he?

554
00:56:33,602 --> 00:56:37,606
Hello?

555
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,556
Just a minute.

556
00:57:17,938 --> 00:57:19,815
Yeah.

557
00:57:28,824 --> 00:57:32,369
-What time is it?
-Early, but you have to go.

558
00:57:33,078 --> 00:57:35,330
-Go? Go where?
-The Fargas place.

559
00:57:35,497 --> 00:57:36,790
I've already seen Fargas.

560
00:57:36,957 --> 00:57:38,750
I think you should see him again.

561
00:57:38,917 --> 00:57:41,503
What is this, some kind of practical joke?
Who are you?

562
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:45,174
-What do you know about Fargas?
-Get dressed. I'll wait for you outside.

563
00:58:28,759 --> 00:58:31,595
Don't bother. He isn't there.

564
00:58:31,762 --> 00:58:33,847
Oh, really? Then where is he?

565
00:58:34,014 --> 00:58:35,724
Over there.

566
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:07,089
God almighty.

567
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:21,520
Wanna get inside?

568
00:59:23,105 --> 00:59:24,606
I had thought about it, yes.

569
00:59:47,963 --> 00:59:49,381
You wait here.

570
01:00:14,448 --> 01:00:16,158
Shit.

571
01:00:37,596 --> 01:00:40,182
Well? Did you find it?

572
01:00:40,349 --> 01:00:43,685
You know, it's come to my attention
that you know too goddamn much.

573
01:00:43,852 --> 01:00:47,356
-Why do you keep following me around?
-You're wasting time asking questions.

574
01:00:47,523 --> 01:00:50,734
Better get out of here. There's
a flight from Lisbon to Paris at noon.

575
01:00:50,901 --> 01:00:53,028
-We should just make it.
-What's with the "we"?

576
01:00:53,195 --> 01:00:54,821
There are two of us, aren't there?

577
01:00:54,988 --> 01:00:57,282
What happened back there?

578
01:01:03,038 --> 01:01:06,333
The old man caught someone stealing,
I guess.

579
01:01:06,792 --> 01:01:09,962
-What do you guess happened to him?
-He drowned.

580
01:01:10,462 --> 01:01:13,090
-With a little help from who?
-He's dead. Who cares?

581
01:01:13,257 --> 01:01:14,925
I do.

582
01:01:15,259 --> 01:01:17,761
I could easily wind up the same way.

583
01:01:17,928 --> 01:01:20,848
Not with me around to look after you.

584
01:01:21,223 --> 01:01:23,100
Oh, I see.
You're my guardian angel then.

585
01:01:23,267 --> 01:01:25,352
If you say so.

586
01:01:29,815 --> 01:01:34,069
-Someone's playing a game with me.
-Of course. You're a part of it.

587
01:01:35,404 --> 01:01:37,781
And you're getting to like it.

588
01:02:24,286 --> 01:02:26,914
-Hello, Gruber.
-Hello, Mr. Corso.

589
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,832
Delighted to see you again.

590
01:02:28,999 --> 01:02:32,211
We don't have any vacancies...

591
01:02:32,544 --> 01:02:35,839
...but I'm sure I'll be able
to organize something.

592
01:02:38,342 --> 01:02:39,801
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

593
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:09,725
Good afternoon.

594
01:04:09,892 --> 01:04:13,604
I'm Dean Corso. I have an appointment
with Baroness Kessler.

595
01:04:18,192 --> 01:04:19,943
This way.

596
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:31,330
You have 30 minutes.

597
01:04:36,418 --> 01:04:39,004
-Yes?
-Monsieur Corso.

598
01:04:39,171 --> 01:04:42,466
Oh, yes, Mr. Corso. Come in.

599
01:04:42,633 --> 01:04:45,719
I've heard a great deal about you.

600
01:04:46,428 --> 01:04:49,848
-Nothing good, I hope.
-You hope right.

601
01:04:50,682 --> 01:04:53,435
Well, I'm reassured, baroness,
because in my trade...

602
01:04:53,602 --> 01:04:58,357
...to be spoken well of
can be professionally disastrous.

603
01:04:59,608 --> 01:05:02,736
-My God.
-Yes, there it is.

604
01:05:02,903 --> 01:05:05,239
The Kessler collection.

605
01:05:07,282 --> 01:05:08,992
I know your catalog almost by heart.

606
01:05:09,159 --> 01:05:10,869
Strange we haven't met before.

607
01:05:11,036 --> 01:05:13,622
Your name is a byword
among dealers and collectors.

608
01:05:14,206 --> 01:05:18,252
But I imagine you know
your own reputation better than I do.

609
01:05:18,418 --> 01:05:21,421
Yes, well, it does keep the wolf
from the door, so to speak.

610
01:05:21,588 --> 01:05:23,549
Sorry, were you
in the middle of something?

611
01:05:23,715 --> 01:05:28,136
My latest work, The Devil: History
and Myth, a kind of biography.

612
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,473
It will be published early next year.

613
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:33,809
-Why the devil?
-I saw him one day.

614
01:05:33,976 --> 01:05:37,896
I was 15 years old
and I saw him as plain as I see you now.

615
01:05:38,355 --> 01:05:39,731
It was love at first sight.

616
01:05:39,898 --> 01:05:42,985
You know, 300 years ago,
you'd have been burned at the stake...

617
01:05:43,151 --> 01:05:46,947
-...for saying something like that.
-I wouldn't have said it.

618
01:05:47,364 --> 01:05:50,617
Nor would I have made
a million by writing about it.

619
01:05:50,784 --> 01:05:52,327
Yeah.

620
01:05:52,494 --> 01:05:55,747
What is it you wish to discuss,
Mr. Corso?

621
01:05:55,914 --> 01:05:59,001
There's a book in your collection
I'd like to examine, if possible.

622
01:05:59,168 --> 01:06:01,086
The Nine Gates
of the Kingdom of Shadows?

623
01:06:01,253 --> 01:06:04,298
The Nine Gates. An interesting work.

624
01:06:04,464 --> 01:06:06,717
Everyone's been asking me
about it lately.

625
01:06:06,884 --> 01:06:09,344
-Is that so?
-Follow me.

626
01:06:12,306 --> 01:06:15,225
Do you truly believe
in the devil, baroness?

627
01:06:15,392 --> 01:06:19,271
Enough to devote my life
and my library to him.

628
01:06:19,438 --> 01:06:22,858
Not to mention many years of work.

629
01:06:23,025 --> 01:06:24,193
Don't you?

630
01:06:24,359 --> 01:06:26,195
Almost.

631
01:06:27,696 --> 01:06:30,199
This book demands
a certain amount of faith.

632
01:06:30,365 --> 01:06:32,618
I'm afraid my faith
is in short supply these days.

633
01:06:32,784 --> 01:06:37,497
I know this work extremely well.
I've studied it for years.

634
01:06:37,664 --> 01:06:40,292
Do you have any doubts
about its authenticity?

635
01:06:40,584 --> 01:06:42,294
-None whatsoever.
-You're sure?

636
01:06:42,461 --> 01:06:44,963
My knowledge of this book is profound.

637
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:48,258
-I wrote a biography of its author.
-Yes, I've read it.

638
01:06:48,425 --> 01:06:51,637
Aristide Torchia,
The Devil's Apprentice. Excellent work.

639
01:06:51,803 --> 01:06:53,388
A courageous man.

640
01:06:53,555 --> 01:06:57,643
He died for the sake
of this very book in 1667.

641
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:01,563
While studying the black arts in Prague,
he acquired a copy...

642
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:04,107
...of the dread Delomelanicon.

643
01:07:04,274 --> 01:07:09,404
This is Torchia's adaptation of that work
which was written by Lucifer himself.

644
01:07:09,571 --> 01:07:12,991
After they burned him at the stake,
a secret society was founded...

645
01:07:13,158 --> 01:07:17,246
...to perpetuate its memory
and preserve its secrets.

646
01:07:17,412 --> 01:07:20,457
The Order of the Silver Serpent.

647
01:07:20,624 --> 01:07:23,585
-A sect?
-A kind of witches' coven.

648
01:07:23,752 --> 01:07:26,255
For centuries,
they have met to read from this book...

649
01:07:26,421 --> 01:07:28,590
...and worship the prince of darkness.

650
01:07:28,757 --> 01:07:31,760
Today, they have degenerated
into a social club...

651
01:07:31,927 --> 01:07:35,764
...for bored millionaires and celebrities
who use its meetings...

652
01:07:35,931 --> 01:07:40,435
...as an excuse to indulge
their jaded sexual appetites.

653
01:07:40,602 --> 01:07:43,355
I, myself, belonged to the order.

654
01:07:43,522 --> 01:07:46,984
Years ago,
but time is too precious at my age.

655
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:49,736
Besides, my orgy days are over.

656
01:07:49,987 --> 01:07:52,698
I told them to go to the devil.

657
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:55,742
You mean it's all about sex or...?

658
01:07:55,909 --> 01:07:57,035
Of course not.

659
01:07:57,202 --> 01:08:00,539
They are under the illusion
that they owe their money and success...

660
01:08:00,706 --> 01:08:02,249
...to membership in the order.

661
01:08:02,416 --> 01:08:03,458
Do they still meet?

662
01:08:03,625 --> 01:08:07,171
Every year
on the anniversary of Torchia's death.

663
01:08:07,337 --> 01:08:08,964
They'll be meeting very soon now.

664
01:08:09,131 --> 01:08:11,800
-And you say they read from this book.
-Not this one.

665
01:08:11,967 --> 01:08:16,388
I took mine back when Liana Telfer
acquired the one in Toledo.

666
01:08:16,555 --> 01:08:18,307
Victor Fargas is a nonbeliever.

667
01:08:18,473 --> 01:08:23,395
He's always refused to participate,
so naturally, they use the Telfer copy.

668
01:08:23,562 --> 01:08:25,772
Not that it has ever worked.

669
01:08:25,939 --> 01:08:28,859
-Did Andrew Telfer ever take part?
-Telfer?

670
01:08:29,026 --> 01:08:30,819
No, no.

671
01:08:30,986 --> 01:08:34,740
That creature, Liana,
married him for his money.

672
01:08:34,907 --> 01:08:38,160
She comes of an old
and aristocratic French family...

673
01:08:38,327 --> 01:08:40,579
...the Saint Martins,
but they were penniless...

674
01:08:40,746 --> 01:08:44,666
...so Liana used his dollars
to restore her chateau...

675
01:08:44,833 --> 01:08:46,502
...and buy The Nine Gates.

676
01:08:46,668 --> 01:08:50,047
If he ever finds out what his wife
gets up to at these gatherings...

677
01:08:50,214 --> 01:08:52,174
...he'll probably kill himself.

678
01:08:53,342 --> 01:08:56,595
Funny you should say that, baroness,
he hanged himself last week.

679
01:09:01,266 --> 01:09:04,895
Who, exactly,
are you working for, Mr. Corso?

680
01:09:05,062 --> 01:09:09,191
My client's name is irrelevant, baroness.
I'm simply trying to authenticate his copy.

681
01:09:09,358 --> 01:09:11,568
The one that Telfer sold him
before he died.

682
01:09:11,735 --> 01:09:15,822
How stupid of me.
I should have guessed.

683
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:20,202
You've outstayed your welcome,
Mr. Corso.

684
01:09:20,369 --> 01:09:22,621
I was hoping to examine
your copy in detail.

685
01:09:22,788 --> 01:09:24,831
Certainly not.

686
01:09:24,998 --> 01:09:27,501
Tell your client,
who can only be Boris Balkan...

687
01:09:27,668 --> 01:09:32,297
...to come and examine it himself,
if he dares.

688
01:09:32,714 --> 01:09:36,927
Tell him not to send any more
wolves in sheep's clothing.

689
01:09:37,386 --> 01:09:40,639
Now, kindly leave.

690
01:09:43,058 --> 01:09:46,728
I'm sorry if I have troubled you.

691
01:09:46,895 --> 01:09:48,480
Thank you very much for your time.

692
01:09:48,647 --> 01:09:52,401
You don't know what you're
getting yourself into, Mr. Corso.

693
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:55,654
Get out, before it's too late.

694
01:09:56,071 --> 01:09:58,323
I'm afraid it already is, baroness.

695
01:09:58,490 --> 01:10:00,075
Good day.

696
01:13:51,765 --> 01:13:53,642
They're broken.

697
01:13:54,268 --> 01:13:56,687
You should be more careful.

698
01:14:11,827 --> 01:14:14,913
-I need a favor, Gruber.
-Certainly, Mr. Corso.

699
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,957
Liana Telfer.

700
01:14:17,124 --> 01:14:21,295
Maiden name de Saint Martin,
40ish, brunette, dishy.

701
01:14:21,461 --> 01:14:24,673
Probably accompanied by...

702
01:14:25,924 --> 01:14:34,308
...a black gentleman with closely cropped
platinum blond hair and a mustache.

703
01:14:34,474 --> 01:14:36,810
I wanna know if they're staying
at some hotel here.

704
01:14:37,186 --> 01:14:38,854
-Take a little time.
-Yes, of course.

705
01:14:39,021 --> 01:14:41,231
Start with the five-stars,
that's your best bet.

706
01:14:41,398 --> 01:14:43,150
-Very well, sir.
-All right.

707
01:14:43,317 --> 01:14:45,527
Are you feeling all right?

708
01:14:45,944 --> 01:14:49,114
I've felt better, Gruber. Thanks.

709
01:14:49,281 --> 01:14:51,533
Let me know if you locate them.

710
01:15:04,713 --> 01:15:09,843
Put this against the back of your neck.

711
01:15:21,522 --> 01:15:24,691
You were really great down there
by the river.

712
01:15:24,858 --> 01:15:26,944
I haven't thanked you for that.

713
01:16:07,901 --> 01:16:10,279
All right, look.

714
01:16:11,029 --> 01:16:13,949
I think it's about time you told me
what's going on here.

715
01:16:14,366 --> 01:16:16,910
-Someone's after your book.
-No kidding.

716
01:16:17,077 --> 01:16:19,454
And you, where do you fit into it?

717
01:16:28,422 --> 01:16:29,923
Yeah?

718
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:33,260
There's a call for you.

719
01:16:34,803 --> 01:16:37,472
May I take it in reception, please?

720
01:16:38,515 --> 01:16:40,976
All right, I'll be right down.

721
01:16:54,615 --> 01:16:56,617
-Yes?
-Anything new?

722
01:16:56,783 --> 01:16:59,077
Oh, his master's voice again.

723
01:16:59,244 --> 01:17:01,205
No, not much aside from the fact...

724
01:17:01,371 --> 01:17:04,875
...that someone's tried to take my life
a couple of times.

725
01:17:05,042 --> 01:17:08,504
Oh, yes. Fargas has been murdered.

726
01:17:10,005 --> 01:17:12,341
Murdered? How do you know?

727
01:17:12,508 --> 01:17:14,718
I saw him. And his copy.

728
01:17:14,885 --> 01:17:17,012
Or what was left of it, anyway.

729
01:17:17,179 --> 01:17:20,807
Someone had snatched the engravings
and tried to burn the rest.

730
01:17:20,974 --> 01:17:24,478
-What do you make of it?
-That's tragic. It's tragic.

731
01:17:24,645 --> 01:17:27,439
What about Baroness Kessler?
How did you get on today?

732
01:17:27,606 --> 01:17:30,317
-Where exactly are you?
-What about her copy?

733
01:17:30,484 --> 01:17:32,319
No. Why do I get the impression...

734
01:17:32,486 --> 01:17:34,738
...that you've been
down my neck the entire time?

735
01:17:34,905 --> 01:17:39,701
ftou're an investment of mine, Mr. Corso.
I'm merely looking after it.

736
01:17:42,871 --> 01:17:44,873
The old woman swears
her copy's authentic...

737
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:48,001
...but I didn't get a chance
to examine it closely.

738
01:17:48,168 --> 01:17:52,256
She threw me out as soon as she
guessed that you were behind my visit.

739
01:17:52,422 --> 01:17:55,467
You aren't exactly in her good books,
if you know what I mean.

740
01:17:55,634 --> 01:17:57,845
-You must see her again.
-What, are you kidding?

741
01:17:58,011 --> 01:18:01,890
-Have you seen her secretary?
-Try the lunch break.

742
01:18:04,101 --> 01:18:05,519
Hello?

743
01:18:33,922 --> 01:18:36,049
Do you have a photocopy machine
back there?

744
01:18:36,216 --> 01:18:37,426
Oh, yes, monsieur.

745
01:18:37,593 --> 01:18:40,929
-May I use it?
-Of course, monsieur.

746
01:21:39,233 --> 01:21:43,654
Yes. Hello, baroness, it's me,
the wolf in sheep's clothing.

747
01:21:43,820 --> 01:21:47,866
I thought I made myself quite clear,
Mr. Corso.

748
01:21:48,033 --> 01:21:52,287
Well, I've got something
for you, baroness.

749
01:21:52,454 --> 01:21:54,331
A kind of peace offering.

750
01:21:54,498 --> 01:21:57,042
Will you allow me to give it to you?

751
01:21:57,209 --> 01:21:58,961
Please?

752
01:22:24,528 --> 01:22:26,321
First, let me apologize.

753
01:22:26,488 --> 01:22:30,367
I should've told you right away
that I'm working for Boris Balkan.

754
01:22:30,534 --> 01:22:34,496
It was foolish of me to think that I could
deceive someone as astute as yourself.

755
01:22:34,663 --> 01:22:39,668
-So please forgive me.
-Flattery will get you nowhere, Mr. Corso.

756
01:22:39,918 --> 01:22:41,670
Get on with it.

757
01:22:41,837 --> 01:22:43,380
Right.

758
01:22:44,756 --> 01:22:46,341
These...

759
01:22:47,968 --> 01:22:49,761
...are for you.

760
01:22:51,805 --> 01:22:53,515
What is this?

761
01:22:53,682 --> 01:22:56,185
What is this supposed to be?

762
01:22:56,643 --> 01:22:59,771
You said that your knowledge
of The Nine Gates was extensive...

763
01:22:59,938 --> 01:23:03,233
...but did you ever compare your copy
with the other two?

764
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:05,027
No.

765
01:23:05,194 --> 01:23:07,905
-Why?
-Well, you should.

766
01:23:08,071 --> 01:23:11,408
These are copies of the engravings
in Balkan's book.

767
01:23:11,575 --> 01:23:14,161
You'll find that some of them differ
from yours.

768
01:23:14,328 --> 01:23:16,121
Differ?

769
01:23:16,705 --> 01:23:20,334
So you question my book's authenticity,
do you?

770
01:23:20,501 --> 01:23:23,003
If that's your peace offering,
you can take it and go.

771
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:25,547
My Nine Gates is absolutely genuine.

772
01:23:25,714 --> 01:23:27,424
I don't dispute that, baroness.

773
01:23:27,591 --> 01:23:30,511
In my opinion,
all three copies are genuine.

774
01:23:30,677 --> 01:23:33,013
But the fact remains,
they display variations.

775
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:35,307
Variations?

776
01:23:35,891 --> 01:23:39,186
If that were true,
it would be a revelation.

777
01:23:39,353 --> 01:23:40,562
What makes you so sure?

778
01:23:42,606 --> 01:23:45,234
I've already compared these
with the Fargas engravings.

779
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:47,694
And in his book...

780
01:23:48,987 --> 01:23:52,241
...the keys were in the other hand.

781
01:23:53,075 --> 01:23:56,078
Here, the doorway wasn't bricked up.

782
01:23:56,828 --> 01:23:58,080
And in this one...

783
01:23:58,247 --> 01:24:01,750
...the man was hanging by the other leg.

784
01:24:17,391 --> 01:24:20,769
-Well?
-Well, what?

785
01:24:23,063 --> 01:24:25,816
Look closely, baroness.

786
01:24:26,608 --> 01:24:28,026
The turrets.

787
01:24:28,193 --> 01:24:29,945
Three in yours...

788
01:24:30,112 --> 01:24:32,030
...four in Balkan's.

789
01:24:43,792 --> 01:24:45,460
Amazing.

790
01:24:45,627 --> 01:24:49,298
I'm convinced there'll be a third one
in here somewhere.

791
01:24:49,464 --> 01:24:53,010
Three variations in three copies
makes nine.

792
01:24:53,177 --> 01:24:55,971
Coincidence, or something more?

793
01:24:56,263 --> 01:25:01,018
Maybe Torchia hid the secret
of the Ninth Gate in three books, not one.

794
01:25:02,686 --> 01:25:04,771
I must admit I'm impressed.

795
01:25:04,938 --> 01:25:08,483
This puts an entirely different complexion
on the matter.

796
01:25:08,650 --> 01:25:13,155
You have my permission
to investigate further, Mr. Corso.

797
01:25:13,322 --> 01:25:15,240
Take as long as you need.

798
01:25:31,089 --> 01:25:34,801
My permission did not extend
to that, Mr. Corso.

799
01:25:36,011 --> 01:25:38,597
Nobody smokes in my library.

800
01:28:22,761 --> 01:28:24,513
Baroness?

801
01:31:11,972 --> 01:31:14,808
Excuse me, there's something missing
from my room.

802
01:31:14,975 --> 01:31:16,852
Has anyone been up there
while I was out?

803
01:31:17,019 --> 01:31:18,812
Only your wife, monsieur.

804
01:31:18,979 --> 01:31:21,356
My wife? I don't have a wife.

805
01:31:21,523 --> 01:31:23,442
Excuse me, monsieur.

806
01:31:27,571 --> 01:31:29,531
For you, sir.

807
01:31:35,162 --> 01:31:38,290
-Yes?
-What news?

808
01:31:39,791 --> 01:31:41,251
News?

809
01:31:41,418 --> 01:31:42,544
Let me see.

810
01:31:42,711 --> 01:31:44,004
Well....

811
01:31:44,171 --> 01:31:48,550
Yes, the good news is that I got to
examine the old woman's book...

812
01:31:48,717 --> 01:31:51,011
...and three of her engravings
were signed "LCF."

813
01:31:51,178 --> 01:31:56,016
The bad news is that someone strangled
her and made a bonfire of her collection.

814
01:31:56,183 --> 01:32:00,270
-Now, that's tragic, wouldn't you say?
-You took the words out my mouth.

815
01:32:00,562 --> 01:32:03,565
Yes. It's the Fargas story all over again.

816
01:32:03,732 --> 01:32:06,151
I'm of the mind
that they tore out the engravings...

817
01:32:06,318 --> 01:32:07,986
...before they torched the place.

818
01:32:08,153 --> 01:32:09,738
That makes woo sets they've got.

819
01:32:09,905 --> 01:32:11,907
And my copy?

820
01:32:12,324 --> 01:32:15,035
Well, I learned my lesson, fortunately.

821
01:32:15,202 --> 01:32:17,204
I don't carry it around with me anymore.

822
01:32:17,371 --> 01:32:19,581
Otherwise, it might've gone up
in smoke.

823
01:32:19,748 --> 01:32:22,376
Excellent. Good thinking.

824
01:32:22,543 --> 01:32:24,294
Well, with two copies gone...

825
01:32:24,461 --> 01:32:26,380
...that seems to conclude
your assignment.

826
01:32:26,547 --> 01:32:28,590
It only remains for you
to return my book.

827
01:32:28,757 --> 01:32:31,969
I'm staying at the Ritz. You can
pick up your check at the same time.

828
01:32:32,135 --> 01:32:34,263
Shall we say in half an hour?

829
01:32:35,973 --> 01:32:38,475
There's more bad news.

830
01:32:39,977 --> 01:32:42,771
-I don't have it.
-You don't have it?

831
01:32:43,355 --> 01:32:46,024
Someone lifted it from my room.

832
01:32:49,653 --> 01:32:53,240
Listen to me very carefully, Mr. Corso.

833
01:32:53,949 --> 01:32:56,201
I think you may already have
some idea...

834
01:32:56,368 --> 01:33:00,789
...of the lengths to which I am prepared
to go when I want something.

835
01:33:01,623 --> 01:33:06,753
Unless you recover my property
in double-quick time...

836
01:33:07,129 --> 01:33:10,632
...you'll discover
just how far that can be.

837
01:33:22,477 --> 01:33:23,729
-Where is it?
-Where's what?

838
01:33:23,896 --> 01:33:25,731
The book, where is it?

839
01:33:25,898 --> 01:33:28,025
Would I be here if I took it?

840
01:33:28,233 --> 01:33:30,903
You should know better by now.

841
01:33:36,158 --> 01:33:38,577
I must apologize for my young colleague,
Mr. Corso...

842
01:33:38,744 --> 01:33:40,746
...that was unpardonable of him.

843
01:33:40,913 --> 01:33:42,623
Is that her?

844
01:33:42,789 --> 01:33:43,790
No, monsieur.

845
01:33:43,957 --> 01:33:46,835
She was tall, dark hair,
very chic, very elegant.

846
01:33:47,002 --> 01:33:49,671
Which reminds me, sir,
I have the information you wanted.

847
01:33:49,838 --> 01:33:51,798
The lady and gentleman
you mentioned...

848
01:33:51,965 --> 01:33:55,636
...they are staying
at the Plaza Athénée Hotel...

849
01:33:55,802 --> 01:33:59,014
...Suite 209, 211.

850
01:33:59,181 --> 01:34:01,183
Thank you very much, Gruber.
I owe you one.

851
01:34:01,350 --> 01:34:03,769
I need a taxi, quick.

852
01:34:05,896 --> 01:34:09,608
Send this to Mr. Balkan at the Ritz.
That's B-A-L-K-A-N.

853
01:34:12,611 --> 01:34:16,156
-Fax it, immediately.
-Certainly, sir.

854
01:34:17,324 --> 01:34:19,409
Always a pleasure to be of service.

855
01:34:19,576 --> 01:34:20,786
You coming?

856
01:34:40,848 --> 01:34:42,933
What do you plan to do
if you see them?

857
01:34:43,100 --> 01:34:45,561
Probably hide behind you.

858
01:35:39,281 --> 01:35:41,283
Whoa, that's them. That's them.

859
01:35:43,785 --> 01:35:47,164
We should grab a taxi
before they take off.

860
01:35:47,873 --> 01:35:49,625
Let's go.

861
01:36:06,975 --> 01:36:08,810
They're going.

862
01:36:41,927 --> 01:36:43,512
Coming?

863
01:36:54,648 --> 01:36:56,775
Couldn't you pick something
less conspicuous?

864
01:36:56,942 --> 01:36:58,360
Don't be so picky.

865
01:36:58,527 --> 01:37:02,030
Some people would give their eyeteeth
for a ride in this.

866
01:37:38,066 --> 01:37:41,904
Listen, we can't sit on their tail forever,
they're bound to smell a rat.

867
01:38:05,928 --> 01:38:06,929
How do I look?

868
01:38:09,223 --> 01:38:11,225
You look ridiculous.

869
01:38:18,774 --> 01:38:20,400
Sit tight.

870
01:39:09,116 --> 01:39:10,993
Take your pick.

871
01:39:11,535 --> 01:39:12,911
No, you.

872
01:39:13,078 --> 01:39:15,789
-You know everything.
-If you say so.

873
01:39:29,344 --> 01:39:31,054
We lost them.

874
01:39:31,221 --> 01:39:33,182
Well, not at this speed.

875
01:39:33,348 --> 01:39:34,683
Must've gone the other way.

876
01:39:34,850 --> 01:39:37,811
You mean,
I don't know everything after all?

877
01:39:37,978 --> 01:39:39,855
Turn around.

878
01:39:53,076 --> 01:39:55,579
30ish, brunette, dishy.

879
01:39:55,746 --> 01:39:58,498
-What was her name again?
-Telfer. Liana Telfer.

880
01:39:58,665 --> 01:40:00,876
No, her maiden name.

881
01:40:01,919 --> 01:40:04,546
-Saint Martin.
-Look.

882
01:40:54,388 --> 01:40:56,473
The chateau, I knew it.

883
01:41:19,538 --> 01:41:25,377
Keep going.

884
01:43:43,849 --> 01:43:46,101
See them anywhere?

885
01:43:49,354 --> 01:43:50,981
No.

886
01:45:19,319 --> 01:45:22,489
-Sorry to intrude on you like this.
-What are you doing here?

887
01:45:22,656 --> 01:45:26,368
I just dropped by to pick up
the book you stole from my room.

888
01:45:26,535 --> 01:45:30,205
-That book is mine.
-We've been through all this before.

889
01:45:30,372 --> 01:45:31,957
My husband gave it to me.

890
01:45:32,124 --> 01:45:34,042
-Well....
-It wasn't his to sell.

891
01:45:34,209 --> 01:45:36,170
Sold it to get back at you.
What happened?

892
01:45:36,336 --> 01:45:38,463
-Catch you with that albino?
-How dare you?

893
01:45:39,256 --> 01:45:41,300
Keep an eye on her.

894
01:45:42,551 --> 01:45:43,844
Don't.

895
01:45:44,011 --> 01:45:46,388
Be careful. She bites.

896
01:45:57,524 --> 01:45:59,109
Hi.

897
01:46:02,404 --> 01:46:03,739
Don't move.

898
01:46:03,906 --> 01:46:05,908
Either one of you.

899
01:46:06,074 --> 01:46:07,951
Get the book.

900
01:46:22,216 --> 01:46:24,927
Don't kill them up here,
you'll make a mess.

901
01:46:25,093 --> 01:46:27,262
Take them downstairs.

902
01:46:28,013 --> 01:46:29,431
You, go first.

903
01:46:29,598 --> 01:46:31,308
And you.

904
01:46:43,529 --> 01:46:45,280
Down.

905
01:46:59,711 --> 01:47:01,630
Open the door.

906
01:47:14,184 --> 01:47:15,811
Watch out.

907
01:47:33,412 --> 01:47:35,247
I didn't know you had it in you.

908
01:48:06,195 --> 01:48:08,197
You stay here and cover me.

909
01:48:08,363 --> 01:48:10,365
I'm going down.

910
01:48:51,240 --> 01:48:52,741
Who's that?

911
01:48:53,867 --> 01:48:59,081
Mumbo jumbo, mumbo jumbo,
mumbo jumbo.

912
01:49:06,338 --> 01:49:09,258
Look around you, all of you.
What do you see?

913
01:49:09,424 --> 01:49:13,136
A bunch of buffoons, in fancy dress.

914
01:49:13,303 --> 01:49:16,723
Think the prince of darkness
would actually deign to manifest himself...

915
01:49:16,890 --> 01:49:19,643
...before the likes of you?
He never has, and he never will.

916
01:49:19,810 --> 01:49:21,270
Never.

917
01:49:22,521 --> 01:49:24,356
You read from his book...

918
01:49:24,523 --> 01:49:27,609
...but you have no conception
of its true power.

919
01:49:27,776 --> 01:49:30,028
I, alone, have grasped its secret.

920
01:49:30,195 --> 01:49:33,115
I, alone, have fathomed
the master's grand design.

921
01:49:33,282 --> 01:49:37,661
I, alone, am worthy to enjoy the fruits
of that discovery.

922
01:49:37,828 --> 01:49:40,622
Absolute power
to determine my own destiny.

923
01:49:40,789 --> 01:49:43,500
You're insane, Boris.
Give it back to me.

924
01:49:43,667 --> 01:49:46,211
You, Liana de Saint Martin...

925
01:49:46,378 --> 01:49:49,631
...you're even guiltier than the rest
of this pathetic rabble.

926
01:49:49,798 --> 01:49:53,135
You have at least some idea of what
this book can do in the right hands.

927
01:49:53,302 --> 01:49:56,305
Yet, you lend yourself
to these farcical proceedings...

928
01:49:56,471 --> 01:50:00,392
...these orgies of aging flesh
conducted in the master's name.

929
01:50:00,559 --> 01:50:01,643
You're a charlatan.

930
01:50:29,505 --> 01:50:32,508
Don't, Corso. Don't.

931
01:50:40,974 --> 01:50:42,851
Let it be.

932
01:51:16,552 --> 01:51:19,263
-What is it with you?
-He just murdered someone in public.

933
01:51:19,429 --> 01:51:21,223
You're off the hook...

934
01:51:21,390 --> 01:51:22,891
...for the other killings.

935
01:51:23,058 --> 01:51:25,143
-You should be grateful.
-I'm ecstatic.

936
01:51:25,310 --> 01:51:27,896
You're out of a job. It's over.
What more do you want?

937
01:51:28,063 --> 01:51:29,898
You know what.

938
01:51:55,757 --> 01:51:57,843
Not taking me for a ride?

939
01:51:58,260 --> 01:52:02,097
-You were working for him all along.
-Funny, I thought you were.

940
01:52:48,644 --> 01:52:50,437
Shit.

941
01:56:59,061 --> 01:57:03,273
Yes.

942
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:05,192
That's it.

943
01:57:05,734 --> 01:57:07,986
Precisely.

944
01:57:09,238 --> 01:57:11,573
All is in readiness.

945
01:57:12,616 --> 01:57:14,409
One...

946
01:57:14,576 --> 01:57:16,245
...four...

947
01:57:16,411 --> 01:57:21,250
...three, six, seven...

948
01:57:21,416 --> 01:57:26,964
...five, eight, woo, nine.

949
01:57:27,673 --> 01:57:29,758
The enigma is solved at last.

950
01:57:31,927 --> 01:57:33,512
To travel in silence...

951
01:57:33,679 --> 01:57:36,056
...by a long and circuitous route...

952
01:57:36,223 --> 01:57:40,727
...to brave the arrows of misfortune
and fear neither noose, nor fire.

953
01:57:40,894 --> 01:57:45,440
To play the greatest of all games
and win, foregoing no expense...

954
01:57:45,607 --> 01:57:50,028
...is to mock the vicissitudes of fate
and gain at last the key...

955
01:57:50,195 --> 01:57:52,489
...that will unlock...

956
01:57:53,240 --> 01:57:55,742
...the ninth gate.

957
01:58:00,455 --> 01:58:01,456
Corso.

958
01:58:02,124 --> 01:58:05,752
What were you expecting,
an apparition?

959
01:58:06,920 --> 01:58:10,549
You're not wanted here, Mr. Corso.
Leave.

960
01:58:10,716 --> 01:58:13,510
I'm the only apparition
you'll see tonight.

961
01:58:13,677 --> 01:58:15,971
You'll find a check waiting
at my New York office.

962
01:58:16,138 --> 01:58:18,140
Payment in full.

963
01:58:18,307 --> 01:58:20,100
You killed for those.

964
01:58:20,267 --> 01:58:23,312
-They're worth more than money.
-Infinitely more.

965
01:58:23,478 --> 01:58:25,480
But they happen to be mine.

966
01:58:25,647 --> 01:58:27,482
Not yours.

967
01:58:28,567 --> 01:58:31,069
You know something, Corso?

968
01:58:31,653 --> 01:58:33,989
In spite of our differences...

969
01:58:34,156 --> 01:58:36,658
...I have a soft spot for you.

970
01:58:36,825 --> 01:58:39,870
-I'm touched.
-We have something in common.

971
01:58:40,037 --> 01:58:41,955
We share the same passion.

972
01:58:42,122 --> 01:58:45,000
You've developed the same obsession,
haven't you?

973
01:58:45,167 --> 01:58:48,712
Unfortunately for you,
only one of us is destined to fulfill it.

974
01:58:48,879 --> 01:58:51,006
You're out of your depth. Kindly go.

975
01:58:52,674 --> 01:58:54,593
I'm not leaving here empty-handed.

976
01:58:54,760 --> 01:58:57,012
Don't even think about it.

977
01:58:57,888 --> 01:58:59,806
Stand aside.

978
01:59:00,349 --> 01:59:02,392
I credited you with more finesse.

979
01:59:02,559 --> 01:59:06,480
-You heard me. Stand back.
-Put that away, it's not your style.

980
01:59:28,168 --> 01:59:31,547
It seems you've found your proper niche
at last.

981
01:59:31,713 --> 01:59:33,549
I like that.

982
01:59:33,882 --> 01:59:35,551
Now...

983
01:59:36,552 --> 01:59:38,720
...you can watch.

984
01:59:46,603 --> 01:59:49,731
I'm entering uncharted territory.

985
01:59:49,940 --> 01:59:55,320
Taking the road that leads to equality
with God.

986
02:00:10,377 --> 02:00:12,337
You can't come with me.

987
02:00:12,504 --> 02:00:16,675
I must travel alone,
but you may look on...

988
02:00:16,925 --> 02:00:18,177
...and marvel.

989
02:00:18,343 --> 02:00:22,181
-That's very kind of you.
-Indeed it is.

990
02:00:24,600 --> 02:00:27,686
There have been men
who have been burned alive...

991
02:00:27,853 --> 02:00:31,231
...or disemboweled
for just a glimpse...

992
02:00:31,398 --> 02:00:36,445
...of what you are about to witness.

993
02:00:43,702 --> 02:00:46,079
I give you my allegiance, master.

994
02:00:46,246 --> 02:00:49,124
I pledge myself to you, body and soul.

995
02:00:49,291 --> 02:00:52,461
Let me fear neither noose,
nor fire, nor poison.

996
02:00:52,628 --> 02:00:54,588
Erase me from the book of life...

997
02:00:54,755 --> 02:00:57,257
...inscribe me
in the black book of death.

998
02:00:57,424 --> 02:01:00,552
Admit me to the ninth gate.

999
02:01:00,719 --> 02:01:02,054
Let it be so.

1000
02:01:05,307 --> 02:01:08,685
Let it be so now.

1001
02:01:19,321 --> 02:01:21,031
Yes.

1002
02:01:22,574 --> 02:01:26,453
I feel the power surge through me
like an electric current...

1003
02:01:26,620 --> 02:01:29,831
...rendering me capable of any feat
of mind or body.

1004
02:01:29,998 --> 02:01:31,542
I'm invulnerable.

1005
02:01:31,708 --> 02:01:33,919
I'm invincible.

1006
02:01:35,671 --> 02:01:40,259
I could float on air,
I could walk on water.

1007
02:01:44,179 --> 02:01:45,180
Behold.

1008
02:01:45,347 --> 02:01:47,307
I plunge my hands in fire.

1009
02:01:47,474 --> 02:01:49,810
I feel no heat.

1010
02:01:49,977 --> 02:01:52,855
That's just great. Give us another one.

1011
02:02:12,875 --> 02:02:15,002
It's miraculous.

1012
02:02:15,419 --> 02:02:19,089
I feel nothing. Nothing at all.

1013
02:05:28,904 --> 02:05:30,656
Is that it?

1014
02:05:31,406 --> 02:05:32,491
Is the game over?

1015
02:05:33,367 --> 02:05:34,743
For Balkan, yes.

1016
02:05:34,910 --> 02:05:36,245
Not for you.

1017
02:05:36,411 --> 02:05:37,996
Why didn't it work for Balkan?

1018
02:05:38,163 --> 02:05:40,082
The ninth engraving was a forgery.

1019
02:05:43,752 --> 02:05:45,796
Where's the real one?

1020
02:05:47,422 --> 02:05:49,174
I want it.

1021
02:05:51,593 --> 02:05:52,928
You're running low on gas.

1022
02:07:32,694 --> 02:07:34,279
Pepe Lopez.

1023
02:07:34,446 --> 02:07:36,031
Ricardo Herrera.

1024
02:07:39,535 --> 02:07:41,537
Do you speak English?
