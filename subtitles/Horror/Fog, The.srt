23.976 English (from SDH)

2
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,924
Are you Kathy Nicolo?

3
00:01:18,461 --> 00:01:20,292
Yeah.

4
00:01:21,197 --> 00:01:23,358
Is this your house?

5
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:48,734
House of Sand and Fog (2003)

6
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:56,422
Nadi, of course,
agreed that it was a wonderful idea

7
00:02:56,493 --> 00:03:00,953
to cut down the trees
at our home on the Caspian,

8
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,624
to have the sea spread before us,

9
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,763
to reach infinity with our eyes,

10
00:03:08,838 --> 00:03:11,500
to see forever.

11
00:03:13,743 --> 00:03:18,510
But then, our life went the way of the trees

12
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:24,076
when the Ayatollahs ripped the soul
out of our beautiful country.

13
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,590
Well, enough.

14
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:31,720
Today is not a day for the old.

15
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,662
It is a day for the young.

16
00:03:34,731 --> 00:03:37,461
To the future.
To our Soraya.

17
00:03:37,534 --> 00:03:40,401
May she be a happy wife
as she is a bride.

18
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,995
And, perhaps,

19
00:03:43,072 --> 00:03:46,371
she will not forget her poor
mother and father so soon

20
00:03:46,443 --> 00:03:50,379
and return to us and give to us
many little grandbabies.

21
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,944
A father can dream.

22
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,275
He's so tan.

23
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:32,651
- Retirement has been good to the colonel.
- He's not. He works for Boeing.

24
00:04:32,722 --> 00:04:36,249
He doesn't work for Boeing.
My son works for Boeing.

25
00:04:36,326 --> 00:04:39,124
Who knows what he does now?

26
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:52,130
<i># I love you</i>

27
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:20,063
<i>Es todo. Terminamos.</i>

28
00:06:42,885 --> 00:06:45,786
<i>- Hello.</i>
<i>- Kathy?</i>

29
00:06:45,855 --> 00:06:49,382
<i>- What time is it?</i>
<i>- It's, um, 9:00.</i>

30
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:53,792
<i>- Mom, it's 6:00 a.m. here.</i>
<i>- I don't think 6:00 a.m. will kill you.</i>

31
00:06:53,863 --> 00:06:56,525
<i>Your father got up at 4:30</i>
<i>every day of his life,</i>

32
00:06:56,599 --> 00:06:58,590
<i>God bless his soul.</i>

33
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:03,735
<i>So, how's it going?</i>
<i>How's the program?</i>

34
00:07:03,806 --> 00:07:06,274
Fine. I'm fine.

35
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,276
<i>One day at a time, right?</i>

36
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,278
<i>I just hope it's working.</i>

37
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:11,904
How's everyone there?

38
00:07:11,981 --> 00:07:14,745
<i>Frankie's good.</i>
<i>Salesman of the month again.</i>

39
00:07:14,817 --> 00:07:16,341
<i>You know your brother.</i>

40
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:19,445
<i>His Lisa's In her seventh month.</i>

41
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,921
Wow.

42
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,787
<i>How's your better half?</i>

43
00:07:22,858 --> 00:07:24,291
Fine.

44
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,555
He's right here.
He's sleeping.

45
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:29,223
<i>Sleeping? Hmm.</i>

46
00:07:29,298 --> 00:07:31,926
Mom, I'm really tired.
I'm gonna go, okay?

47
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:35,493
<i>Listen. I almost forgot.</i>
<i>Your Aunt Frances won a trip to Reno.</i>

48
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:38,802
<i>We're gonna come out on the 18th.</i>
<i>I thought we'd stop by.</i>

49
00:07:38,874 --> 00:07:39,966
The 18th?

50
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,839
<i>Yeah. Two weeks.</i>

51
00:07:41,911 --> 00:07:43,572
Yeah, okay.

52
00:07:43,646 --> 00:07:47,207
Um, Nick's gonna be away
on business, though.

53
00:07:47,283 --> 00:07:49,774
<i>- Again?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

54
00:07:49,852 --> 00:07:51,843
<i>- Wow.</i>
<i>- I'm gonna go, okay, Mom?</i>

55
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:53,912
<i>- You're still not smoking, right?</i>
<i>- Bye.</i>

56
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,254
<i>'Cause they say it's a slippery...</i>

57
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:21,478
Just a second!

58
00:08:31,494 --> 00:08:32,859
You Kathy Lazaro?

59
00:08:32,928 --> 00:08:35,419
Yeah. Why?

60
00:08:38,901 --> 00:08:43,964
Due to the nonpayment of business taxes
associated with this property,

61
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,704
the county has petitioned the court
on its behalf to reclaim these costs.

62
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:53,306
It should come as no surprise to you.
I'm sure you've had ample warning.

63
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,877
We've sent many notices.

64
00:08:56,952 --> 00:09:01,446
Now the house is up
for auction tomorrow morning.

65
00:09:01,524 --> 00:09:04,459
Auction?
What are you talking about?

66
00:09:04,527 --> 00:09:06,654
Are you out of your mind?

67
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,762
There's no smoking In my house.

68
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:21,603
Hey, Chuck.

69
00:09:21,677 --> 00:09:25,579
'Cause I see your number right here.

70
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,310
Yeah. We gonna meet down there?

71
00:09:28,384 --> 00:09:33,151
Supposed to be a hot one today.
I'd dress lightly if I were you.

72
00:09:33,222 --> 00:09:36,919
It's okay, 'cause I'm not leaving.

73
00:09:36,992 --> 00:09:39,358
I'm afraid you have no choice,
Mrs. Lazaro.

74
00:09:39,428 --> 00:09:42,591
All of your things will be auctioned off
with the property.

75
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,929
Do you want that?

76
00:09:45,768 --> 00:09:47,827
Look, you can't evict me.

77
00:09:47,903 --> 00:09:51,202
I never owed a fucking business tax.
It doesn't make sense.

78
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,508
Okay, well, this is where I get off.

79
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:01,414
Deputy Sheriff Burdon will assist you
In vacating the property.

80
00:10:19,435 --> 00:10:21,300
Do you have a lawyer?

81
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,430
I can't afford a lawyer.
I'm a house cleaner.

82
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,606
Here's the number
for the legal assistance office.

83
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:34,638
They may be able to help.
Nothing's written In blood.

84
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:38,744
You just have to clear out today.
You might be moving back In next week.

85
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:45,125
In the meantime, maybe you can call
some friends or family.

86
00:10:45,194 --> 00:10:47,685
Stay with them.

87
00:10:47,763 --> 00:10:50,561
There's no one to call.

88
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,932
I'll tell you what.

89
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,435
I know some movers
that owe me a favor.

90
00:11:02,511 --> 00:11:04,206
Brian.

91
00:11:05,548 --> 00:11:08,483
Go down to Safeway
and get some boxes.

92
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:10,917
Let's help this lady pack up.

93
00:11:13,989 --> 00:11:15,923
Lester.

94
00:11:41,813 --> 00:11:43,906
May I help you?

95
00:11:43,982 --> 00:11:46,883
My car is parked here.

96
00:11:46,952 --> 00:11:49,682
You asked yesterday also.

97
00:14:06,491 --> 00:14:09,358
Oh, oh, what happened to you?

98
00:14:09,428 --> 00:14:10,417
I fell.

99
00:14:10,495 --> 00:14:12,486
- Again?
- Yeah.

100
00:14:12,564 --> 00:14:15,124
Wash up.
Do not get blood on the floor.

101
00:15:26,771 --> 00:15:29,638
The house was repossessed
for tax payment delinquency.

102
00:15:29,707 --> 00:15:31,902
It's got three bedrooms, one bath.

103
00:15:31,976 --> 00:15:34,410
A widow's walk would increase
property value.

104
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:36,310
What is this "widow's walk"?

105
00:15:36,381 --> 00:15:39,748
A deck on top of the house
so you can see the ocean.

106
00:15:39,817 --> 00:15:42,149
We still got time here.
Feel free to look around.

107
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,224
Nadereh.

108
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:30,817
Today God has kissed our eyes.

109
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,998
Do you remember
our bungalow on the Caspian,

110
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,198
how I ordered the trees
cut down on the west side

111
00:17:42,273 --> 00:17:45,436
so we may view the sea?

112
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,977
Please, be quiet.

113
00:17:47,044 --> 00:17:51,037
Do you remember how the general
brought his family there for New Year,

114
00:17:51,115 --> 00:17:52,548
how beautiful it was?

115
00:17:52,617 --> 00:17:55,381
What is the matter for you today, Behrani?

116
00:17:56,687 --> 00:17:57,711
Nadi?

117
00:18:01,993 --> 00:18:04,985
I today have bought for us
another bungalow.

118
00:18:06,497 --> 00:18:09,557
I purchased this home
for a price no one would believe.

119
00:18:09,634 --> 00:18:13,263
It is worth two, maybe three times that.

120
00:18:13,337 --> 00:18:16,272
We will live In this home
for a short while

121
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,604
and then sell it and
find one even better.

122
00:18:18,676 --> 00:18:21,110
<i>Nah! Nah!</i>

123
00:18:54,412 --> 00:18:57,074
Perhaps you did not come here
to live like a gypsy.

124
00:18:57,148 --> 00:18:59,480
But I did not come here
to work like an Arab...

125
00:19:00,484 --> 00:19:02,179
to be treated like an Arab.

126
00:19:02,253 --> 00:19:05,313
For four years we have lived
a life we could not afford

127
00:19:05,389 --> 00:19:09,485
and spent almost everything
to marry Soraya with a good family.

128
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:14,497
This apartment alone has cost
us over $140,000 In rent.

129
00:19:14,565 --> 00:19:17,830
And what of Esmail's
university education?

130
00:19:17,902 --> 00:19:20,837
Soon we will have nothing.

131
00:19:20,905 --> 00:19:25,365
And then you will see what it is like
to walk In the shoes of the gypsies.

132
00:19:31,315 --> 00:19:33,112
So...

133
00:19:35,786 --> 00:19:39,552
tomorrow, you will begin packing,
and there's no more to discuss.

134
00:19:39,624 --> 00:19:41,956
Do not open your lips.

135
00:19:56,373 --> 00:20:00,309
$500? They evicted you
from your house for that?

136
00:20:00,377 --> 00:20:01,435
You got it.

137
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:05,971
Um, are you staying with friends?

138
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:08,483
Yeah, I'm with a friend.

139
00:20:10,554 --> 00:20:15,890
- How much is this gonna cost me?
- It's on a sliding scale.

140
00:20:16,893 --> 00:20:20,124
Um, how come you didn't do something
about this earlier?

141
00:20:20,196 --> 00:20:21,185
I did.

142
00:20:21,264 --> 00:20:23,357
I went to the courthouse,
months ago,

143
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:28,370
and I signed a statement saying
that I never owed a business tax

144
00:20:28,438 --> 00:20:31,771
because I never owned a business.

145
00:20:32,609 --> 00:20:34,668
I even had it certified.

146
00:20:34,744 --> 00:20:36,541
And what about the follow-up mail?

147
00:20:37,747 --> 00:20:39,237
I didn't open it.

148
00:20:46,957 --> 00:20:50,950
It's very important to me that
I get my house back by the 18th.

149
00:20:51,027 --> 00:20:53,052
I'm expecting company.

150
00:20:53,129 --> 00:20:56,121
- When did you sign that letter?
- I don't know.

151
00:20:56,199 --> 00:20:57,291
March?

152
00:20:57,367 --> 00:21:00,803
Well, I hate to be
the bearer of bad news,

153
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,395
but the county's
already sold your house.

154
00:21:03,473 --> 00:21:05,373
What?

155
00:21:08,645 --> 00:21:14,311
- No. They can't do that.
- The auction date's been set for months.

156
00:21:14,384 --> 00:21:19,947
Don't worry. They'll rescind the sale,
or we'll file a lawsuit against the county.

157
00:21:20,023 --> 00:21:23,356
- We'll get your house back.
- Before the 18th, right?

158
00:21:23,426 --> 00:21:25,621
It's possible.

159
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:12,460
Fuck.

160
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:18,639
Hello.

161
00:22:25,585 --> 00:22:27,109
- Sorry.
- Shit.

162
00:22:27,186 --> 00:22:30,178
- I didn't mean to scare you.
- Don't do that.

163
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,385
You all right?

164
00:22:33,459 --> 00:22:36,121
Yeah. I'm fine. You?

165
00:22:36,195 --> 00:22:37,560
Good. Good.

166
00:22:44,604 --> 00:22:46,663
You working undercover or something?

167
00:22:46,739 --> 00:22:48,001
Excuse me?

168
00:22:49,342 --> 00:22:52,072
No. I'm off.

169
00:22:52,145 --> 00:22:56,639
I just... I drive by this way, and, uh...

170
00:22:56,716 --> 00:22:59,879
figured I'd check In on you,
see how you're holding up.

171
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,180
They already sold your house?

172
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:06,191
Technically, it's mine and my brother's.

173
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:08,887
My dad left it to us when he died.

174
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,427
I haven't told my family.

175
00:23:14,133 --> 00:23:17,125
My lawyer's trying
to get them to rescind it.

176
00:23:18,838 --> 00:23:22,535
So I'm trying not
to harp on the negative.

177
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:32,347
You have any kids, Mr. Burdon?

178
00:23:35,088 --> 00:23:36,146
Two.

179
00:23:37,724 --> 00:23:39,555
Call me Lester.

180
00:23:41,394 --> 00:23:44,955
My husband left me eight months ago.

181
00:23:46,733 --> 00:23:48,724
No one knows that, either.

182
00:24:07,787 --> 00:24:10,551
Do you mind if I give you
some professional advice?

183
00:24:10,623 --> 00:24:11,715
No.

184
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:14,885
Do it all through your lawyer, Kathy.

185
00:24:14,961 --> 00:24:18,328
I wouldn't drive past that house
till the keys were back In my hand.

186
00:24:21,801 --> 00:24:24,031
Thanks for checking In on me.

187
00:24:24,837 --> 00:24:25,929
Sure.

188
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,907
Night.

189
00:24:33,379 --> 00:24:35,939
Hey, Kathy, wait.

190
00:24:36,015 --> 00:24:39,507
Listen. This is my direct number
at the department.

191
00:24:39,585 --> 00:24:41,416
Most of the time, I'm on patrol.

192
00:24:41,487 --> 00:24:47,687
But if you ever need anything,
anything at all, just leave a message.

193
00:24:52,265 --> 00:24:55,029
- See ya.
- Good night.

194
00:25:53,992 --> 00:25:57,325
It is like our garden In Isfahan.

195
00:26:38,437 --> 00:26:40,200
<i>Hello?</i>

196
00:26:40,272 --> 00:26:41,796
<i>Hello?</i>

197
00:26:47,446 --> 00:26:50,244
Yeah?

198
00:26:50,315 --> 00:26:54,547
Your credit card didn't go through.
That's two days now.

199
00:27:00,792 --> 00:27:03,283
God, I'm really sorry about that.

200
00:27:03,362 --> 00:27:06,695
Look, um, I'm gonna get
my paycheck on Friday.

201
00:27:06,765 --> 00:27:10,724
Is there any way we can
let it slide until then?

202
00:29:53,127 --> 00:29:56,255
The only affordable way
to put a terrace up there

203
00:29:56,331 --> 00:29:59,095
is to put the stairs
on the outside.

204
00:30:00,335 --> 00:30:02,565
It'll have to block
that kitchen window.

205
00:30:04,806 --> 00:30:06,862
I could do that for about a grand.

206
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:10,205
If we have to go through the roof,
about $4,000 to $ 7,000.

207
00:30:10,277 --> 00:30:14,373
- But this window must be obstructed?
- I don't see any other way.

208
00:30:15,949 --> 00:30:17,814
That is acceptable.

209
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:21,613
Can you start today?

210
00:31:38,298 --> 00:31:39,731
Hey!

211
00:31:41,902 --> 00:31:44,632
Hey!

212
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:52,706
- What are you doing?
- Excuse me?

213
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:55,475
What the fuck are you doing?
This is my house.

214
00:31:55,549 --> 00:31:56,538
Who are you?

215
00:31:56,617 --> 00:31:59,177
This is my house.
Who said you could do this?

216
00:31:59,253 --> 00:32:01,813
- Are you Mrs. Behrani?
- No.

217
00:32:01,889 --> 00:32:05,848
Mr. Behrani hired us.
You're gonna have to talk to him.

218
00:32:19,706 --> 00:32:20,798
Oh, fuck.

219
00:32:20,874 --> 00:32:23,365
- Whoa, lady.
- Shit.

220
00:32:23,443 --> 00:32:24,467
Damn!

221
00:32:25,312 --> 00:32:26,802
Stay right there.
Don't move.

222
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,370
Hold on.

223
00:32:28,882 --> 00:32:31,442
Ah! Oh, man.

224
00:32:32,352 --> 00:32:34,752
- Let's get her inside.
- Fuck.

225
00:32:34,821 --> 00:32:37,153
Come on.

226
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:40,949
Careful.

227
00:32:47,701 --> 00:32:50,101
Could we use your bathroom?
She stepped on...

228
00:32:56,376 --> 00:32:59,868
Sorry, ma'am. Could we use
your washroom to clean her foot?

229
00:33:04,718 --> 00:33:07,278
- Okay.
- It is okay.

230
00:33:08,255 --> 00:33:11,053
For one moment, please.

231
00:33:13,126 --> 00:33:14,354
Here.

232
00:33:15,028 --> 00:33:16,689
I got it.

233
00:33:29,276 --> 00:33:31,744
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

234
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,041
Have you had a tetanus shot lately?

235
00:33:36,116 --> 00:33:38,209
I'm gonna be sick.

236
00:33:38,285 --> 00:33:41,880
Is she bleeding?
Excuse me.

237
00:33:41,955 --> 00:33:44,753
- Esmail, a bandage.
- Okay.

238
00:33:57,471 --> 00:33:59,632
I don't want to ruin your towel.

239
00:34:02,509 --> 00:34:05,069
Here.
I use this for skateboarding.

240
00:34:05,145 --> 00:34:08,308
Don't worry. I washed it.

241
00:34:16,757 --> 00:34:17,746
Okay.

242
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:52,419
This is, of course, our family pictures.

243
00:34:55,128 --> 00:34:56,561
Thank you.

244
00:35:29,396 --> 00:35:31,364
I think I should go.

245
00:35:32,995 --> 00:35:34,519
What happened?

246
00:35:35,631 --> 00:35:39,499
I'll tell you what happened.
My yard is a construction site.

247
00:35:40,302 --> 00:35:44,398
- You were there?
- Yeah, I was there. I was at my house.

248
00:35:44,473 --> 00:35:46,532
I stepped on some nails.

249
00:35:46,608 --> 00:35:50,374
I was bleeding on my own doorstep,
waiting for a stranger to open my door.

250
00:35:50,446 --> 00:35:54,780
You can't just go over there.
You've got to let us handle this.

251
00:35:59,321 --> 00:36:01,653
I want them out of my house.

252
00:36:02,758 --> 00:36:06,319
They're already more at home there
than I ever was.

253
00:36:10,532 --> 00:36:11,897
Did you get their name?

254
00:36:13,469 --> 00:36:16,802
Ah... Bahroony?

255
00:36:16,872 --> 00:36:20,239
Behmini, something like that.
They're Middle Eastern.

256
00:36:21,243 --> 00:36:23,803
- Gary?
- Yes, Connie?

257
00:36:23,879 --> 00:36:26,245
Will you type a letter
to the courier service

258
00:36:26,315 --> 00:36:28,943
and make sure that it
gets to a Mr. Behrmini?

259
00:36:57,379 --> 00:37:02,817
It's damn hard to sell a house nowadays.
This is what you call a real buyer's market.

260
00:37:03,919 --> 00:37:07,514
Well, sorry,
but she comes In at...

261
00:37:07,589 --> 00:37:10,023
$174,000.

262
00:37:43,692 --> 00:37:46,388
- You're late, Behrani.
- I am not late.

263
00:37:46,461 --> 00:37:50,557
I have come to tell you that I'm no longer
to return to this job.

264
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,525
You tell the office, Colonel?

265
00:37:53,735 --> 00:37:54,724
No.

266
00:37:55,804 --> 00:37:57,169
So why tell me, man?

267
00:38:23,699 --> 00:38:25,724
Is this you?

268
00:38:26,602 --> 00:38:27,933
Hmm.

269
00:38:33,175 --> 00:38:37,373
"... inform you... that under
these circumstances...

270
00:38:40,082 --> 00:38:43,347
"currently owe, or as a property...

271
00:38:43,418 --> 00:38:46,785
"we request that you vacate
the property immediately."

272
00:38:48,624 --> 00:38:52,788
Mother whores! Goddamn it!

273
00:39:24,893 --> 00:39:26,827
Mr. Barmeeny is here.

274
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:30,093
Oh, Mr. Barmeeny.

275
00:39:30,165 --> 00:39:33,259
My name is Behrani.

276
00:39:33,335 --> 00:39:36,998
Colonel Massoud Amir Behrani.

277
00:39:37,072 --> 00:39:39,233
I wish to speak with Mr. Walsh, please.

278
00:39:39,307 --> 00:39:43,038
I'm Connie Walsh.
This is my office, Colonel.

279
00:39:43,111 --> 00:39:45,739
Please come In.

280
00:39:50,986 --> 00:39:53,978
I'm sure our letter came
as a shock to you, Colonel.

281
00:39:54,056 --> 00:39:58,755
The situation is this: Pacific County
has made a number of mistakes.

282
00:39:58,827 --> 00:40:02,160
First, they levied a tax
on my client which she did not owe.

283
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:07,634
Second, they evicted her for nonpayment.
And third, they auctioned the property.

284
00:40:07,703 --> 00:40:11,901
- Unfortunately, this is where you come In.
- But I now own the house.

285
00:40:11,973 --> 00:40:16,376
I paid for it In cash.
I have a bill of sale. Here, please.

286
00:40:16,445 --> 00:40:18,913
Would you sell the county back the house?

287
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:23,508
They would make it as comfortable
a transaction as possible.

288
00:40:23,585 --> 00:40:28,579
Please listen to me very carefully.
The only comfortable transaction possible

289
00:40:28,657 --> 00:40:32,457
is if the county tax office
paid to me $174,000.

290
00:40:32,527 --> 00:40:36,122
Mr. Behrani, you only paid
a quarter of that amount.

291
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,130
The market can already pay me this.
Good morning, Miss Walsh.

292
00:40:44,506 --> 00:40:45,871
Wait, please.

293
00:40:46,675 --> 00:40:49,303
From a legal standpoint,
you are In the right.

294
00:40:49,377 --> 00:40:53,143
But the true owner of this house
is living In a motel, Mr. Behrani.

295
00:40:53,215 --> 00:40:55,445
All her belongings are locked In storage.

296
00:40:55,517 --> 00:40:59,385
Why should she wait to get back
into her home that was wrongfully taken?

297
00:40:59,454 --> 00:41:03,083
Just because you want to turn a profit.

298
00:41:03,158 --> 00:41:06,025
Things are not as they appear.

299
00:41:06,094 --> 00:41:09,825
It is a matter of necessity
for me and my family.

300
00:41:09,898 --> 00:41:14,267
I'm sorry. I do not have
a choice In this matter.

301
00:42:19,601 --> 00:42:21,569
Hey.

302
00:42:24,572 --> 00:42:26,096
This is a surprise.

303
00:42:26,174 --> 00:42:28,233
Good one or a bad one?

304
00:42:28,309 --> 00:42:30,368
It's good.
It's good.

305
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,814
What happened to your foot?

306
00:42:34,882 --> 00:42:36,179
Oh, I, um...

307
00:42:36,251 --> 00:42:39,709
I stopped by my house, and they were
doing construction on the roof.

308
00:42:39,787 --> 00:42:41,584
I stepped on some nails.

309
00:42:41,656 --> 00:42:44,625
Thanks for letting me
ride along today, Mr. Burdon.

310
00:42:48,263 --> 00:42:50,731
So, how's the El Rancho?

311
00:42:50,798 --> 00:42:53,096
I'm not there anymore.

312
00:42:53,167 --> 00:42:55,226
I'm staying at the Bonneville now.

313
00:42:55,303 --> 00:42:57,931
I don't know it.

314
00:42:58,006 --> 00:43:00,167
You're looking at it.

315
00:43:13,788 --> 00:43:16,780
I haven't had a drink
In three years, Lester.

316
00:43:17,525 --> 00:43:20,983
Oh, I'm sorry. I... I should have asked.
I didn't know.

317
00:43:21,062 --> 00:43:23,394
No, it's okay.

318
00:43:27,902 --> 00:43:30,962
The fog's coming In.

319
00:43:38,479 --> 00:43:41,642
I'd like to ask you
a personal question, if I could.

320
00:43:41,716 --> 00:43:44,082
Okay.

321
00:43:45,086 --> 00:43:47,054
Just get it over with.

322
00:43:47,121 --> 00:43:49,681
Why is your husband no longer with you?

323
00:43:54,162 --> 00:43:56,027
I wanted kids.

324
00:43:57,298 --> 00:43:59,129
He didn't want kids.

325
00:44:00,468 --> 00:44:04,905
But I guess if he really wanted me,
he would have wanted them, too.

326
00:44:11,279 --> 00:44:13,509
I think he's a fool.

327
00:44:18,686 --> 00:44:21,052
Maybe we should find you
a place to stay.

328
00:44:35,236 --> 00:44:39,104
Do you remember the beauty
of the Caspian Sea, Esmail?

329
00:44:39,173 --> 00:44:42,040
The water like glass.

330
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:44,135
The beach sand like gold.

331
00:44:47,882 --> 00:44:50,578
It is beautiful here.

332
00:44:51,919 --> 00:44:55,252
Massoud, when must we move again?

333
00:44:55,323 --> 00:44:57,314
Not too soon.

334
00:44:57,392 --> 00:45:01,453
Perhaps once we get a buyer, we will
tell them to wait until autumn.

335
00:45:01,529 --> 00:45:04,089
Would you prefer that?

336
00:45:04,165 --> 00:45:06,929
I will do as you wish.

337
00:45:08,569 --> 00:45:11,299
There was this little runt of a guy.

338
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:16,842
Kept beating up his wife.
Except she wouldn't press charges.

339
00:45:16,911 --> 00:45:19,778
We'd show up,
and there they'd be at the door

340
00:45:19,847 --> 00:45:23,544
like Romeo and Juliet, arm In arm.

341
00:45:23,618 --> 00:45:25,586
She had welts and bruises all over.

342
00:45:25,653 --> 00:45:29,145
So, one night we get called out there again,

343
00:45:29,223 --> 00:45:34,160
and I slipped down their hallway
and stuffed two eight-balls In his closet.

344
00:45:34,228 --> 00:45:36,355
Turns out he was on parole.

345
00:45:36,431 --> 00:45:41,767
He goes back to jail, she's safe,
and I slept like a baby.

346
00:45:46,274 --> 00:45:48,174
Did I just lose you?

347
00:45:48,242 --> 00:45:49,834
No.

348
00:45:50,378 --> 00:45:53,643
I'm sorry. I, um...

349
00:45:53,714 --> 00:45:56,774
To tell you the truth, I think
the wine's distracting me.

350
00:45:56,851 --> 00:45:59,285
- I'll send it back.
- No, it's fine.

351
00:45:59,353 --> 00:46:00,877
- You sure?
- Yeah.

352
00:46:00,955 --> 00:46:05,221
See, when I think of my sobriety,
I don't think about wine.

353
00:46:06,127 --> 00:46:08,322
Alcohol was never a problem.

354
00:46:10,264 --> 00:46:12,858
Well, you're a grown woman.

355
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:31,382
Cheers.

356
00:47:50,164 --> 00:47:53,565
- What are your kids' names?
- Nate and Bethany.

357
00:47:53,634 --> 00:47:56,467
Nate is four. Bethany is nine.

358
00:47:58,839 --> 00:48:01,205
- Where is your house?
- In Millbrae.

359
00:48:01,275 --> 00:48:05,268
In a housing development
called Palomino Meadows.

360
00:48:05,346 --> 00:48:08,076
You have to drive through it
to get to the mall.

361
00:48:08,149 --> 00:48:11,084
Yeah, I know where that is.

362
00:48:11,152 --> 00:48:15,111
God, I've probably driven
by it a dozen times.

363
00:48:15,189 --> 00:48:18,056
I've probably even seen your wife.

364
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:23,794
- Carol.
- Yeah. Carol.

365
00:48:27,868 --> 00:48:32,635
- What's your situation, Les?
- I married my best friend.

366
00:48:32,707 --> 00:48:34,868
And for seven of
the last nine years,

367
00:48:34,942 --> 00:48:39,311
I haven't wanted to give her more
than a hug or a peck on the cheek.

368
00:48:40,081 --> 00:48:41,571
That's my situation.

369
00:48:41,649 --> 00:48:45,517
- What about her?
- It's not the same for her.

370
00:48:57,365 --> 00:49:00,232
Do you want to come inside?

371
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:13,900
Massoud.

372
00:50:27,988 --> 00:50:29,979
We are blessed.

373
00:50:46,135 --> 00:50:50,128
- What time is it?
- It's 10:00.

374
00:50:50,206 --> 00:50:51,867
Oh, God.

375
00:50:51,941 --> 00:50:55,206
I should have been home hours ago.

376
00:50:55,278 --> 00:50:57,303
I'm sure Carol called the department.

377
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:00,907
I'm sure they asked her
if I was feeling any better.

378
00:51:06,856 --> 00:51:08,687
Things are finally In motion.

379
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:13,423
I'm finally gonna get it over with.

380
00:51:13,496 --> 00:51:14,793
It?

381
00:51:16,265 --> 00:51:18,358
Telling her the truth
about how I feel.

382
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:23,365
How do you feel?

383
00:51:31,147 --> 00:51:33,206
I feel found.

384
00:51:56,939 --> 00:51:59,806
Well, Kathy, bad news.

385
00:51:59,875 --> 00:52:03,072
The county's done their part,
but the new owner won't go along.

386
00:52:03,145 --> 00:52:05,705
He's asking for four times
what he bought it for.

387
00:52:05,781 --> 00:52:08,249
We can sue the county,
but it'll take months.

388
00:52:10,286 --> 00:52:12,880
Do you mean that...

389
00:52:12,955 --> 00:52:15,685
I can't legally get my house back?

390
00:52:15,758 --> 00:52:18,750
It would've been a lot easier
if you'd just opened your mail.

391
00:52:18,828 --> 00:52:21,023
You can't expect the law to work miracles.

392
00:52:21,097 --> 00:52:26,592
I don't expect miracles.
I expect you to do your fucking job.

393
00:52:30,206 --> 00:52:33,539
I don't know what I'm doing
sitting here talking to you.

394
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:37,067
And as you see,
very excellent rooms.

395
00:52:37,146 --> 00:52:40,638
It is cool inside,
even during the day.

396
00:52:40,716 --> 00:52:44,049
And from the widow's walk,
sunsets are quite beautiful.

397
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,111
There is very little fog In this area.

398
00:52:46,188 --> 00:52:49,214
- When would the house be available?
- Not until autumn.

399
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:53,159
- We would need time to find a new home.
- That might work for us.

400
00:52:56,732 --> 00:53:00,930
Yes. She has come for a tool her boyfriend
carpenter may have left behind.

401
00:53:01,003 --> 00:53:04,097
I have been expecting her.
One moment, please.

402
00:53:05,508 --> 00:53:09,103
I am happy you came.
Please, this way. I will show you.

403
00:53:09,178 --> 00:53:12,238
My family knows nothing of this.
I'd like for it to remain so.

404
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:14,339
You have me confused
with someone else.

405
00:53:14,417 --> 00:53:16,817
I'm quite certain I know who you are.

406
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,981
I'm Kathy Nicolo.

407
00:53:20,756 --> 00:53:23,156
I know my lawyer talked to you,
Mr. Bahrooni,

408
00:53:23,225 --> 00:53:28,128
- but I thought we could meet face-to-face.
- My name is Behrani. Colonel Behrani.

409
00:53:28,197 --> 00:53:30,927
Colonel Behrani, I'm sorry.

410
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,663
My father left this house
to me and my brother.

411
00:53:34,737 --> 00:53:37,672
Tell this to the bureaucrats
at the County Tax Office.

412
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,401
They have made a mistake, not I.

413
00:53:39,475 --> 00:53:43,104
They said they'd give you
your money back. You've put that deck on.

414
00:53:43,179 --> 00:53:45,113
I'm sure they'd repay you for that.

415
00:53:45,181 --> 00:53:47,775
I'm sorry, but I've nothing more to say.

416
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:50,444
Why should I be penalized
for their incompetence?

417
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:52,885
You should sue them for enough
to buy ten homes.

418
00:53:52,955 --> 00:53:56,618
I'll even sell you this house
for the right price. That's all I require.

419
00:53:56,692 --> 00:54:00,492
I don't know where he left his hammers.
I've nothing more to say.

420
00:54:00,563 --> 00:54:02,394
Let go of me.

421
00:54:02,465 --> 00:54:05,957
You can't expect to just move In here
and make money off of this.

422
00:54:06,035 --> 00:54:07,627
This is my house.

423
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:10,228
I lived here, and you stole
this house from me,

424
00:54:10,306 --> 00:54:12,638
you son of a bitch!

425
00:54:22,151 --> 00:54:24,312
This is a stolen house!

426
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:27,321
He's trying to sell you
a stolen house!

427
00:55:03,625 --> 00:55:06,219
What'd you tell your kids?

428
00:55:07,229 --> 00:55:10,357
I told them the truth.

429
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:14,664
My old man walked out on us.
I swore I would never do that to my own.

430
00:55:33,321 --> 00:55:35,050
What happened?

431
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:40,660
My lawyer couldn't get the house back.

432
00:55:40,729 --> 00:55:43,391
So I went to see the owner.

433
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:47,026
- And he put his hand on you?
- It's okay. Don't worry about it.

434
00:55:47,102 --> 00:55:49,536
That's not right.

435
00:55:49,604 --> 00:55:52,038
He's got no right to do that.

436
00:55:56,344 --> 00:55:58,471
Who is this guy?

437
00:55:58,547 --> 00:56:00,412
His name's Behrani.
He's a colonel.

438
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:02,882
Behrani?
What country is he from?

439
00:56:02,951 --> 00:56:06,387
I don't know.
But his wife hardly speaks any English.

440
00:56:10,625 --> 00:56:15,619
Maybe they haven't been here that long.
Maybe they don't know their way around.

441
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:22,026
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna pay 'em a visit.

442
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:28,708
Officers tend to listen to other officers.
It's worth a shot.

443
00:56:28,777 --> 00:56:30,768
What if he doesn't listen?

444
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,509
Then I'll make him listen.

445
00:56:42,958 --> 00:56:46,416
<i>Oomadan! Oomadan!</i>

446
00:56:49,998 --> 00:56:50,987
Little bird.

447
00:56:51,066 --> 00:56:55,264
Little bird!
Little bird!

448
00:56:55,337 --> 00:56:57,271
Welcome to our new home.

449
00:56:59,674 --> 00:57:03,542
- Does it go down the hill?
- It is an investment property, Soraya.

450
00:57:03,612 --> 00:57:06,410
Like our second home on the Caspian.

451
00:57:07,082 --> 00:57:09,607
It's an investment home.

452
00:57:14,689 --> 00:57:18,181
Let us go to the roof porch,
for the view.

453
00:57:35,534 --> 00:57:37,729
Jesus, look at them.

454
00:57:37,803 --> 00:57:40,704
What are they celebrating,
stealing a woman's house?

455
00:57:43,375 --> 00:57:45,536
Fuck these people.

456
00:57:45,611 --> 00:57:47,875
<i>You're a very wise man,</i>
<i>Genob Sarhang,</i>

457
00:57:47,947 --> 00:57:52,577
to live In such a place that gives you
a view of God's wonders.

458
00:59:15,634 --> 00:59:18,626
Did you post that sign, sir?

459
00:59:18,704 --> 00:59:21,298
Yes. Is there a difficulty, officer?

460
00:59:21,373 --> 00:59:24,069
And that's your sign
at the bottom of the hill?

461
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:25,576
Yes.

462
00:59:26,779 --> 00:59:30,180
Please, come In, officer.

463
00:59:40,726 --> 00:59:44,856
I am new to the area.
Is a permit required to post signs?

464
00:59:45,898 --> 00:59:47,388
Not on the house.

465
00:59:47,466 --> 00:59:51,061
- But the utility pole's city property.
- I see.

466
00:59:51,136 --> 00:59:55,402
Very well. I will put the sign elsewhere.
Thank you for informing me.

467
00:59:55,474 --> 00:59:58,272
You're a long way from home,
aren't you?

468
00:59:58,344 --> 01:00:00,744
This is my home.
I am an American citizen.

469
01:00:00,813 --> 01:00:03,008
Were you a general?

470
01:00:03,082 --> 01:00:05,346
I was a colonel.

471
01:00:06,719 --> 01:00:09,153
Officer, what more can I do for you?

472
01:00:09,221 --> 01:00:10,813
What's your name?

473
01:00:10,889 --> 01:00:13,153
Massoud Amir Behrani.

474
01:00:13,225 --> 01:00:15,819
And the names of your family?

475
01:00:15,894 --> 01:00:19,421
Why do you need the names of my family?
What is your name, Officer?

476
01:00:19,498 --> 01:00:23,195
Deputy Sheriff Joe Gonzalez.
Let me ask you a question.

477
01:00:23,268 --> 01:00:25,395
Are you selling this house on your own?

478
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:27,735
I do not wish to offend, Officer,

479
01:00:27,806 --> 01:00:30,468
but if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.

480
01:00:30,542 --> 01:00:32,476
Civil code 1101.

481
01:00:32,544 --> 01:00:34,739
Yes, you have informed me.

482
01:00:34,813 --> 01:00:38,010
I suggest you come with me
to witness the removal of the sign.

483
01:00:38,083 --> 01:00:41,519
No, I'm talking about
the disclosure law, Colonel.

484
01:00:41,587 --> 01:00:45,387
You, as the owner, have the obligation
to tell all prospective buyers

485
01:00:45,457 --> 01:00:48,858
anything about the property
they have a right to know.

486
01:00:48,927 --> 01:00:51,191
I do not understand.

487
01:00:51,597 --> 01:00:54,964
- You sure about that?
- Are you interrogating me, Mr. Gonzalez?

488
01:00:55,033 --> 01:00:59,129
I don't know. You tell me. I understand
your friend, the Shah, made a habit of it.

489
01:00:59,204 --> 01:01:02,401
I don't know who you think you're
speaking to, but I've had enough.

490
01:01:02,474 --> 01:01:04,942
You have done your job.
Now you may leave.

491
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:18,454
You're used to giving orders, aren't you?
Let me get right to the point here.

492
01:01:18,524 --> 01:01:22,483
Pacific County has offered you money.
They don't want any trouble.

493
01:01:22,561 --> 01:01:25,394
The only one that seems
to want trouble is you.

494
01:01:25,964 --> 01:01:27,955
You don't want to do the right thing,

495
01:01:28,033 --> 01:01:31,969
which is to sell this house
back at the price you paid

496
01:01:32,037 --> 01:01:34,665
so it can be returned to the real owner.

497
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:38,801
The real owner, Mr. Behrani.
Now, that just won't wash.

498
01:01:53,959 --> 01:01:57,258
I have more than one contact
at Immigration.

499
01:01:57,329 --> 01:02:00,196
People get deported every single day.

500
01:02:00,999 --> 01:02:04,162
There are a lot of things
I can do, Colonel.

501
01:02:04,236 --> 01:02:07,831
I suggest you call the movers,
so I won't have to.

502
01:02:31,196 --> 01:02:33,721
What happened?

503
01:02:33,799 --> 01:02:36,700
Well, the guy's obviously
not right off the boat.

504
01:02:36,768 --> 01:02:38,497
I think you're right.

505
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:42,939
He probably buys up seized property
to make a killing.

506
01:02:43,008 --> 01:02:46,910
I set him straight.
I think he'll listen.

507
01:02:48,981 --> 01:02:50,642
He will.

508
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:58,981
So, what do we do now?

509
01:03:00,859 --> 01:03:03,225
I mean...

510
01:03:03,295 --> 01:03:06,025
Look at us.
We're both homeless.

511
01:03:22,214 --> 01:03:25,672
Listen. My friend has
a cabin a few miles south.

512
01:03:25,751 --> 01:03:28,345
We can stay there.

513
01:03:28,687 --> 01:03:32,555
Give to me an answer, Behrani.
What did that man say of deporting?

514
01:03:32,624 --> 01:03:36,082
- He said nothing, Nadi.
- Do not lie to me! I heard him.

515
01:03:36,161 --> 01:03:38,789
Who was that man?
Tell to me, Behrani.

516
01:03:38,864 --> 01:03:40,957
What have you done?

517
01:03:41,033 --> 01:03:43,524
It's none of your business
what I have done.

518
01:03:43,602 --> 01:03:47,402
Have you no faith In me, no respect?
That man said I must remove the sign.

519
01:03:47,472 --> 01:03:49,497
<i>- Coward! Liar!</i>
<i>- Mawmawn.</i>

520
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:52,510
<i>You kasif liar!</i>

521
01:03:52,578 --> 01:03:55,706
It is your fault we were
forced to flee from Iran.

522
01:03:55,781 --> 01:03:57,976
<i>- It is your fault we are here.</i>
<i>- Mawmawn!</i>

523
01:03:58,050 --> 01:04:00,245
Yours and your Savak friends!

524
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:01,513
<i>Mawmawn!</i>

525
01:06:04,370 --> 01:06:07,168
How long can we stay here?

526
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:10,073
Until we get things figured out.

527
01:06:19,585 --> 01:06:21,485
You hungry?

528
01:06:21,554 --> 01:06:23,613
I could eat.

529
01:07:23,449 --> 01:07:25,747
Do you still love her?

530
01:07:30,823 --> 01:07:33,018
Look, it's just...

531
01:07:34,193 --> 01:07:36,661
it's not her.

532
01:07:36,729 --> 01:07:40,130
She's a good person.
A good mother.

533
01:07:42,902 --> 01:07:45,302
Would this have happened anyway...

534
01:07:46,305 --> 01:07:48,170
even if you hadn't met me?

535
01:07:49,242 --> 01:07:51,005
Yes.

536
01:08:02,588 --> 01:08:04,283
I miss my dad.

537
01:08:11,297 --> 01:08:15,028
He worked really hard for that house.

538
01:08:16,602 --> 01:08:18,399
It took him...

539
01:08:21,674 --> 01:08:25,132
thirty years to pay it off.

540
01:08:25,211 --> 01:08:28,009
And it took me eight months
to fuck it up.

541
01:08:28,648 --> 01:08:31,378
Hey. Hey.

542
01:08:34,086 --> 01:08:35,747
Come here.

543
01:08:38,658 --> 01:08:41,058
We're gonna get your house back.

544
01:08:41,127 --> 01:08:43,220
Soon.

545
01:08:43,296 --> 01:08:46,754
When this is all done,
I promise,

546
01:08:48,134 --> 01:08:50,659
I'll move you back In myself.

547
01:09:40,386 --> 01:09:42,650
My son.

548
01:09:43,756 --> 01:09:47,089
Do not follow the example of your father
one day when you are married.

549
01:09:47,159 --> 01:09:49,252
Do not do as I did last evening.

550
01:09:53,099 --> 01:09:55,727
Do not be disrespectful, son.
Look at me.

551
01:10:02,641 --> 01:10:05,940
<i>Bawbaw... were you a Savaki?</i>

552
01:10:06,012 --> 01:10:07,036
No.

553
01:10:08,447 --> 01:10:11,644
I only bought
fighter planes for Shah-jahn.

554
01:10:11,717 --> 01:10:15,209
- Why did that man say we'd be deported?
- I do not know.

555
01:10:15,287 --> 01:10:17,050
But we are American citizens.

556
01:10:17,123 --> 01:10:20,923
We own this house.
They can do nothing to us now.

557
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:23,719
<i>I feel bad for that lady, bawbaw-jahn.</i>

558
01:10:25,998 --> 01:10:29,525
The woman's house was taken from her
because she did not pay her taxes.

559
01:10:29,602 --> 01:10:33,402
That happens when one is not responsible.
Do you understand?

560
01:10:33,472 --> 01:10:34,962
Do not feel bad.

561
01:10:35,041 --> 01:10:37,236
Americans do not
deserve what they have.

562
01:10:37,309 --> 01:10:41,678
They have the eyes of children who
are forever looking for the next distraction,

563
01:10:41,747 --> 01:10:45,808
entertainment, sweet taste In the mouth.
We are not like them.

564
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:51,588
We know rich opportunities when we see
them and don't throw away God's blessing.

565
01:10:54,627 --> 01:10:57,562
You know I must raise money
for your education.

566
01:10:57,630 --> 01:10:59,621
I can get another paper route.

567
01:10:59,698 --> 01:11:01,962
<i>Man meedoonam,</i>

568
01:11:03,035 --> 01:11:04,696
<i>azizam.</i>

569
01:11:06,705 --> 01:11:08,297
I know.

570
01:11:09,542 --> 01:11:12,375
You are a kind child.

571
01:11:12,445 --> 01:11:15,437
Quickly becoming a man.

572
01:11:15,514 --> 01:11:17,573
You have my respect for your heart.

573
01:11:25,124 --> 01:11:27,183
Soon all this will be over.

574
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:34,860
<i>Bawbaw-jahn.</i>

575
01:11:36,102 --> 01:11:38,195
Thank you.

576
01:12:31,022 --> 01:12:32,717
Hey.

577
01:12:38,363 --> 01:12:40,854
Have a good day at work.

578
01:12:49,474 --> 01:12:52,409
You need to see what you're doing
to this family, Les.

579
01:12:52,477 --> 01:12:55,275
Look at your children,
at the damage you're causing.

580
01:12:55,347 --> 01:12:58,180
- This is not the time for this, Carol.
- When is the time?

581
01:12:58,249 --> 01:13:01,116
When I'm not on my way to work.

582
01:13:03,722 --> 01:13:05,778
Stop it!

583
01:13:06,257 --> 01:13:08,885
Do you want to get arrested?
Is that what you want?

584
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:12,953
You want to arrest me? God, go ahead.
Arrest me In front of our children.

585
01:13:13,031 --> 01:13:15,556
Daddy, please.

586
01:13:16,735 --> 01:13:18,760
Please!

587
01:13:21,306 --> 01:13:23,536
Oh, God, I didn't mean to do this.

588
01:13:23,608 --> 01:13:26,202
Don't go.
Please, don't go.

589
01:13:26,277 --> 01:13:29,246
We checked, and we have
no Joe Gonzalez on the force.

590
01:13:29,314 --> 01:13:33,774
Did he have anything else on him
that might help us to ID him?

591
01:13:33,852 --> 01:13:38,016
We have hundreds of deputies
In the department.

592
01:13:38,089 --> 01:13:40,580
He wore a golden star,

593
01:13:40,658 --> 01:13:45,118
a badge with two
pistol barrels crossed...

594
01:13:45,196 --> 01:13:48,063
and letters of gold spelling F-T-O.

595
01:14:03,148 --> 01:14:06,413
There are only eight field training officers
In the department.

596
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:09,248
Tell me if you see him here.

597
01:14:17,695 --> 01:14:22,098
Yes. That is him.

598
01:14:22,167 --> 01:14:24,362
That is the man who threatened me.

599
01:14:25,070 --> 01:14:26,697
It's Burdon.

600
01:14:27,705 --> 01:14:31,641
You're completely confident
this is the officer?

601
01:14:36,247 --> 01:14:38,238
I'm sorry this happened to you, sir.

602
01:14:38,316 --> 01:14:40,807
I can promise you,
it won't happen again.

603
01:14:56,868 --> 01:14:58,335
Hi.

604
01:15:02,273 --> 01:15:04,935
What do you think?

605
01:15:05,009 --> 01:15:07,341
I cleaned the whole place.

606
01:15:09,714 --> 01:15:11,045
What's wrong?

607
01:15:13,618 --> 01:15:16,143
Kath, I need to go home
for a while today.

608
01:15:16,221 --> 01:15:20,555
I need to go home and explain
things to Carol better,

609
01:15:20,625 --> 01:15:22,684
to Nate and Bethany.

610
01:15:23,495 --> 01:15:26,293
I should be home when
they come back from school.

611
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:30,227
- You just said "home" three times.
- It is my home.

612
01:15:32,904 --> 01:15:35,702
At least until we make another one.

613
01:15:37,509 --> 01:15:41,605
- Are you coming back?
- In a couple of hours, three at the most.

614
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:44,045
I'll understand if you don't.

615
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:50,451
I don't deserve you.

616
01:15:56,794 --> 01:15:58,921
Of course you do.

617
01:17:17,075 --> 01:17:18,736
Fuck.

618
01:17:24,415 --> 01:17:30,684
I told the kids that this was just temporary,
you were taking time off, like a vacation.

619
01:17:32,156 --> 01:17:34,522
I didn't know what else to tell them.

620
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:38,390
Tell them the truth, Carol.

621
01:17:47,772 --> 01:17:49,103
Hello?

622
01:17:49,173 --> 01:17:51,505
<i>Deputy Lester Burdon?</i>

623
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:00,881
Hello.

624
01:18:00,952 --> 01:18:03,420
<i>- Deputy Lester Burdon?</i>
<i>- Yes?</i>

625
01:18:03,488 --> 01:18:08,084
Lieutenant Alvarez with Internal Affairs.
Dispatch yourself to my office immediately.

626
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:10,821
Can it wait till I'm back on duty, sir?

627
01:18:10,895 --> 01:18:14,353
<i>No, deputy, it cannot.</i>
<i>Be In my office In 45 minutes,</i>

628
01:18:14,432 --> 01:18:17,833
<i>or you can come In tomorrow</i>
<i>and drop off your badge.</i>

629
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:45,924
Please, a moment. Wait.

630
01:18:45,996 --> 01:18:48,521
Oh, excuse for me, please.

631
01:18:50,634 --> 01:18:55,298
Oh, I am sorry
for keeping you to waiting.

632
01:18:55,372 --> 01:18:57,306
How is your foot?

633
01:18:57,374 --> 01:18:59,808
- Better. Thank you.
- Oh.

634
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:02,703
Can I come In?

635
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:05,806
- Please, come In.
- Thank you.

636
01:19:11,121 --> 01:19:13,851
I grew up In this house.

637
01:19:13,924 --> 01:19:17,917
It's the house my father left
to me and my brother when he died.

638
01:19:17,995 --> 01:19:21,795
The county evicted me
from this house by mistake,

639
01:19:21,865 --> 01:19:24,265
and your husband bought it,

640
01:19:24,334 --> 01:19:28,998
and now he won't sell it back
for less than four times what he paid.

641
01:19:29,072 --> 01:19:33,065
I don't want to argue with him.
You know, I really don't.

642
01:19:33,143 --> 01:19:37,341
It's just that if this goes to court,
it could take...

643
01:19:37,414 --> 01:19:41,282
- They are to deport us?
- I don't know.

644
01:19:41,351 --> 01:19:45,481
You must see.
They will kill us.

645
01:19:45,556 --> 01:19:48,024
They will shoot my children.

646
01:19:53,564 --> 01:19:56,362
Hey. Hey.

647
01:19:58,502 --> 01:20:01,630
You don't understand a word
I'm saying, do you?

648
01:20:01,705 --> 01:20:05,300
Please, you are a very nice girl.

649
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:07,707
Please, you write for me everything.

650
01:20:07,778 --> 01:20:10,645
I want for to understand,

651
01:20:10,714 --> 01:20:14,047
for discussing with my husband.

652
01:20:14,117 --> 01:20:16,745
- Okay?
- Okay.

653
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:57,293
Do you think you can frighten me with your
stupid deputy coming here telling lies?

654
01:20:57,361 --> 01:20:59,488
What do you think I am?

655
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:02,191
- Do you think I'm stupid?
- Don't!

656
01:21:02,266 --> 01:21:06,225
In my country, you'd not be worthy
to raise your eyes to me. You're nothing!

657
01:21:06,303 --> 01:21:08,294
<i>- Nakon!</i>
<i>- Tell your deputy friend</i>

658
01:21:08,372 --> 01:21:10,772
his superior officers know everything.

659
01:21:10,841 --> 01:21:12,832
You tell him that.
This is our home!

660
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:14,070
- Please...
- Our home!

661
01:21:14,144 --> 01:21:17,079
Please stop!

662
01:21:17,147 --> 01:21:19,274
Please to stop, Behrani.

663
01:21:33,764 --> 01:21:37,928
<i>- Kathy? K, is that you?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

664
01:21:39,269 --> 01:21:41,669
<i>Mom said you sounded</i>
<i>strange on the phone.</i>

665
01:21:41,738 --> 01:21:43,603
<i>What's going on?</i>

666
01:21:43,674 --> 01:21:47,735
I need help.
I really need some help.

667
01:21:47,811 --> 01:21:49,403
<i>What's wrong?</i>

668
01:21:49,479 --> 01:21:52,346
Do you think you could
just come out here?

669
01:21:52,416 --> 01:21:54,213
Please?

670
01:21:54,284 --> 01:21:56,013
<i>K.</i>

671
01:21:56,086 --> 01:21:59,351
<i>K, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I just got a real shit storm here.</i>

672
01:21:59,423 --> 01:22:02,256
<i>We just got the new models In,</i>
<i>there's inventory...</i>

673
01:22:02,326 --> 01:22:06,820
<i>I'll be right there.</i>
<i>Just give me a second here.</i>

674
01:22:06,897 --> 01:22:09,422
I just feel lost, Frankie.

675
01:22:09,499 --> 01:22:12,627
You know? I just, um...

676
01:22:15,005 --> 01:22:17,064
I just feel lost.

677
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:20,200
<i>Look, Ma and the aunts</i>
<i>will be out there on the 18th.</i>

678
01:22:20,277 --> 01:22:24,475
<i>They can help you, bring you back,</i>
<i>straighten you out. Okay?</i>

679
01:22:24,548 --> 01:22:27,415
<i>I'm sorry, K,</i>
<i>but I gotta go. Okay?</i>

680
01:22:27,484 --> 01:22:29,475
Okay.

681
01:22:29,553 --> 01:22:31,521
Yeah.

682
01:22:31,588 --> 01:22:34,056
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Chin up, baby sister.</i>

683
01:22:34,124 --> 01:22:35,591
<i>I'll call you later.</i>

684
01:22:35,659 --> 01:22:39,356
Okay.
Hey, don't tell Mom, all right?

685
01:22:41,498 --> 01:22:43,295
Okay, bye.

686
01:22:43,367 --> 01:22:44,732
Fuck.

687
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:21,822
Pack of Royals.

688
01:23:21,897 --> 01:23:23,558
Wild night, huh?

689
01:23:23,632 --> 01:23:26,863
Seems to be heading In that direction.

690
01:23:28,704 --> 01:23:30,899
- Have a good one.
- Thanks.

691
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:42,375
This and, um, three on two.

692
01:23:46,121 --> 01:23:51,058
- You need a funnel with that?
- No. Just a book of matches.

693
01:26:20,409 --> 01:26:22,673
Oh, God!

694
01:26:24,946 --> 01:26:27,847
Oh, God!

695
01:26:49,004 --> 01:26:53,873
I'm sorry.

696
01:27:15,263 --> 01:27:19,495
I don't want the house anymore.

697
01:27:19,568 --> 01:27:21,729
I don't care.

698
01:27:21,803 --> 01:27:23,794
Nadi! Nadereh!

699
01:27:32,314 --> 01:27:35,112
I can't...

700
01:27:40,722 --> 01:27:42,849
Don't go.

701
01:27:47,596 --> 01:27:50,258
Don't go.

702
01:27:51,867 --> 01:27:53,926
Don't go.

703
01:27:55,103 --> 01:27:58,504
<i>Nakon. Nakon.</i>
<i>Nakon. Nakon.</i>

704
01:27:58,573 --> 01:28:02,236
You must sleep now.
You must rest.

705
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,230
Please, some tea.

706
01:29:29,698 --> 01:29:32,189
Please, have bath to relax.

707
01:29:49,584 --> 01:29:51,245
Shh. Esmail.

708
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:59,724
That car In the driveway,
is it that woman's?

709
01:29:59,794 --> 01:30:01,989
The woman has tried to take
her own life.

710
01:30:02,063 --> 01:30:03,724
We must help her.

711
01:30:03,798 --> 01:30:07,063
<i>Pesaram, she is a bird, a broken one.</i>

712
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:13,735
Your grandfather used to say that a bird
which flies into your house is an angel.

713
01:30:13,808 --> 01:30:16,003
You must look upon his presence
as a blessing.

714
01:30:16,077 --> 01:30:19,843
<i>We have a guest In the house.</i>
<i>You must be a gentleman,joon-am.</i>

715
01:30:20,549 --> 01:30:22,073
Very kind,

716
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:24,084
very polite,

717
01:30:24,152 --> 01:30:26,086
very quiet.

718
01:32:07,022 --> 01:32:08,250
Hello?

719
01:32:08,323 --> 01:32:11,451
Hello?

720
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:13,460
Do you need anything?

721
01:32:15,397 --> 01:32:16,762
Hello?

722
01:32:16,831 --> 01:32:18,696
<i>Nah!</i>

723
01:32:21,202 --> 01:32:23,670
<i>Bolandsho, bolandsho.</i>

724
01:32:30,345 --> 01:32:32,540
Your mouth...
your mouth to open.

725
01:32:32,614 --> 01:32:34,514
Very good. Your mouth.

726
01:32:34,582 --> 01:32:36,516
Very good.

727
01:32:36,584 --> 01:32:40,076
Yes. Yes.

728
01:32:42,691 --> 01:32:44,488
<i>Biroon!</i>

729
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:47,892
Ah, very good.

730
01:32:51,366 --> 01:32:54,358
I feel sorry for her.

731
01:32:54,436 --> 01:32:58,304
<i>- We should have moved.</i>
<i>- Ghazatoh bokhor.</i>

732
01:33:04,846 --> 01:33:07,041
Yes, perhaps you are right.

733
01:33:07,115 --> 01:33:08,946
We should have moved.

734
01:34:28,296 --> 01:34:30,321
Put her down! Put her down!

735
01:34:30,398 --> 01:34:31,888
- Aah!
- Put her down!

736
01:34:31,966 --> 01:34:34,230
What did you do to her?
Step back!

737
01:34:34,302 --> 01:34:36,031
Shut up!

738
01:34:36,103 --> 01:34:38,697
- Listen! Listen!
- No! Move!

739
01:34:38,773 --> 01:34:39,762
Les...

740
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,206
- Don't.
- Move!

741
01:34:51,953 --> 01:34:53,545
What did you do to her?

742
01:34:53,621 --> 01:34:57,682
- She took a whole bottle of my mom's pills.
- Bring 'em to me.

743
01:35:02,763 --> 01:35:04,424
How many? When?

744
01:35:04,498 --> 01:35:07,296
English! English!

745
01:35:09,236 --> 01:35:13,832
My wife says, 20 tablets,
perhaps half an hour ago.

746
01:35:13,908 --> 01:35:17,173
My wife made her lose her stomach.
She has vomited the pills.

747
01:35:17,244 --> 01:35:19,735
She also tried to shoot herself
with that pistol.

748
01:35:19,814 --> 01:35:23,773
I discovered her with it In her automobile.
She was quite upset.

749
01:35:23,851 --> 01:35:26,718
She'd been drinking a great deal.

750
01:35:29,857 --> 01:35:31,984
That's bullshit.

751
01:35:34,595 --> 01:35:36,529
Come here.

752
01:35:36,597 --> 01:35:39,498
Pick her up.
Carry her into that room.

753
01:35:46,073 --> 01:35:47,301
Carefully!

754
01:35:57,818 --> 01:35:59,513
Step away.

755
01:36:11,899 --> 01:36:16,768
She'll be okay.
All right, come on.

756
01:36:23,544 --> 01:36:26,138
I don't want to see this door move.

757
01:36:42,630 --> 01:36:47,124
Get some rest, 'cause tomorrow
you're selling this place back to the county.

758
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:54,539
Kath?

759
01:36:56,143 --> 01:36:58,077
Kathy?

760
01:36:58,145 --> 01:36:59,976
- Kathy!
- Hmm?

761
01:37:27,308 --> 01:37:28,969
Fuck.

762
01:37:29,910 --> 01:37:32,401
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

763
01:38:04,041 --> 01:38:05,736
<i>- Bawbaw?</i>
<i>- Yes?</i>

764
01:38:06,643 --> 01:38:09,441
- I have to go.
- Use the toilet.

765
01:38:11,081 --> 01:38:13,743
Your mother will not look.

766
01:38:27,531 --> 01:38:29,624
Esmail.

767
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:33,966
Today I want you to pretend
to be frightened of this man.

768
01:38:34,037 --> 01:38:36,904
- You must do everything he says.
- Why?

769
01:38:36,973 --> 01:38:39,237
He's weak.
He's nothing without his gun.

770
01:38:42,212 --> 01:38:46,672
He's very scared.
And a scared man is dangerous.

771
01:38:46,750 --> 01:38:47,876
We will...

772
01:38:47,951 --> 01:38:52,354
<i>remain lions In our hearts, pesaram.</i>

773
01:39:14,578 --> 01:39:17,012
- You're here.
- I'm here.

774
01:39:20,250 --> 01:39:22,241
Sir. Sir.

775
01:39:22,319 --> 01:39:24,719
Please let us out so my family can eat.

776
01:39:27,457 --> 01:39:31,587
- What's going on?
- I locked them In the bathroom.

777
01:39:32,129 --> 01:39:35,064
Why?
That's crazy, Les.

778
01:39:35,132 --> 01:39:38,863
No. What's crazy
is trying to kill yourself.

779
01:39:38,935 --> 01:39:40,163
Kathy, why?

780
01:39:43,206 --> 01:39:46,039
I didn't think you were coming back.

781
01:39:47,444 --> 01:39:50,311
Well, I'm back.

782
01:39:50,380 --> 01:39:52,712
Do you really want to die?

783
01:39:54,618 --> 01:39:56,916
I just wanted things to change.

784
01:39:59,256 --> 01:40:02,748
You will get out when
you call the goddamn county!

785
01:40:02,826 --> 01:40:04,020
Sir.

786
01:40:04,094 --> 01:40:06,289
Sir, may I speak with you?

787
01:40:13,303 --> 01:40:15,203
- What?
- Please open the door.

788
01:40:15,272 --> 01:40:18,002
I wish to speak with you directly.

789
01:40:26,516 --> 01:40:29,349
I think I have a possible resolution.

790
01:40:29,419 --> 01:40:31,580
You and I will go
to the government office

791
01:40:31,655 --> 01:40:35,648
and I will sign the necessary papers
for returning the house to them.

792
01:40:35,725 --> 01:40:38,922
They to me will write
a check for $45,000.

793
01:40:38,995 --> 01:40:41,930
This check I will give
to you and the woman,

794
01:40:41,998 --> 01:40:46,298
In exchange for putting
the house In my name.

795
01:40:47,804 --> 01:40:50,534
- You would do that?
- I would do that.

796
01:40:53,043 --> 01:40:55,170
Wait.

797
01:41:00,684 --> 01:41:04,347
- We can't do this, Les.
- I think that this can all work out.

798
01:41:04,421 --> 01:41:06,548
He signs the house to the county.

799
01:41:06,623 --> 01:41:10,491
When he gets the check, he gives it to us,
then you sign the house back to him.

800
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:14,087
It's wrong.
It's just wrong to do it this way.

801
01:41:14,164 --> 01:41:16,894
This has got to work.
This way, you get some money.

802
01:41:16,967 --> 01:41:18,958
He gets what he wants, the house.

803
01:41:19,035 --> 01:41:21,902
It's a win-win situation.
No one gets hurt.

804
01:41:21,972 --> 01:41:24,702
Let's just go.

805
01:41:24,774 --> 01:41:27,368
Please, let's just go.

806
01:41:27,444 --> 01:41:29,571
Kathy, we could use that money.

807
01:41:29,646 --> 01:41:31,773
To start new.

808
01:41:31,848 --> 01:41:36,012
- It's our only choice now.
- He'll never let it happen.

809
01:41:40,790 --> 01:41:44,191
All right, leave the keys
and go do what you promised.

810
01:41:45,194 --> 01:41:48,527
But your son stays here with me.

811
01:41:48,598 --> 01:41:52,193
You're not back soon,
Ishmael and I will be gone.

812
01:41:52,268 --> 01:41:54,532
But we have made an agreement.

813
01:41:59,008 --> 01:42:00,202
No.

814
01:42:00,276 --> 01:42:03,541
I will for you do nothing
without my son.

815
01:42:03,613 --> 01:42:05,376
Nothing.

816
01:42:14,290 --> 01:42:15,814
Shit.

817
01:42:16,959 --> 01:42:18,950
Fine. Let's just do this.

818
01:42:36,646 --> 01:42:39,581
Move it, Colonel. Come on.
You, too, Ishmael.

819
01:42:41,651 --> 01:42:43,710
Excuse me, Mr. Burdon.

820
01:42:43,786 --> 01:42:45,777
- Slow down.
- Deputy Sheriff Burdon.

821
01:42:45,855 --> 01:42:49,848
Sir? I know you're busy.

822
01:42:49,926 --> 01:42:52,918
I just wanted to say
I appreciate everything you taught me.

823
01:42:54,864 --> 01:42:58,595
- I just wanted to say thanks.
- Hey, I appreciate that.

824
01:42:58,668 --> 01:43:01,136
And good luck to you, Brian.

825
01:43:13,816 --> 01:43:15,340
All right.

826
01:43:16,018 --> 01:43:17,542
Now, you listen to me.

827
01:43:17,620 --> 01:43:20,214
When we get In there,
you and Ishmael here,

828
01:43:20,289 --> 01:43:22,382
you're gonna have
to hear me a lot better.

829
01:43:22,458 --> 01:43:24,824
You have to do exactly what I tell you.

830
01:43:24,894 --> 01:43:27,158
Help. Somebody, help us!

831
01:43:27,230 --> 01:43:29,698
Somebody call police, fast!

832
01:43:29,765 --> 01:43:34,225
My name is Esmail, not Ishmael.

833
01:43:35,371 --> 01:43:39,307
<i>Pesaram. Pesaram!</i>
<i>Help, somebody! Call police!</i>

834
01:43:39,375 --> 01:43:41,172
Esmail, please.

835
01:43:41,244 --> 01:43:42,836
Drop it now!

836
01:43:42,912 --> 01:43:45,403
- I said drop it!
- Wait!

837
01:43:55,157 --> 01:43:57,022
No!

838
01:44:01,697 --> 01:44:04,257
We have an officer-involved shooting.

839
01:44:07,670 --> 01:44:10,662
Goddamn it, this kid
is gonna bleed to death.

840
01:44:10,740 --> 01:44:13,004
Call to hospital!

841
01:44:13,075 --> 01:44:14,736
Hospital!

842
01:44:14,810 --> 01:44:15,799
Sir...

843
01:44:15,878 --> 01:44:19,370
I want only my son!
I want only my son!

844
01:44:20,783 --> 01:44:22,512
- Sir...
- I want only my son!

845
01:44:23,753 --> 01:44:26,415
I want only my son!

846
01:44:28,124 --> 01:44:29,716
My son!

847
01:44:32,228 --> 01:44:33,889
It is him, he has done this.

848
01:44:33,963 --> 01:44:37,956
I will kill you!
I will kill you!

849
01:44:38,034 --> 01:44:39,831
I will kill you!

850
01:44:44,440 --> 01:44:46,931
<i>Pesaram, I am here!</i>

851
01:44:48,945 --> 01:44:51,937
<i>Pesaram, I am here!</i>

852
01:44:57,553 --> 01:45:00,215
<i>Pesaram, I am here!</i>

853
01:45:04,493 --> 01:45:07,291
<i>Pesaram, I am here!</i>

854
01:45:14,603 --> 01:45:17,003
What is your name, Deputy?

855
01:45:17,073 --> 01:45:18,802
Sir?

856
01:45:19,542 --> 01:45:22,443
- What?
- What is your name?

857
01:45:36,759 --> 01:45:39,751
I'm so sorry about all of this.

858
01:45:43,632 --> 01:45:45,964
I have a headache.

859
01:45:46,035 --> 01:45:48,697
Please, excuse for me.

860
01:46:05,720 --> 01:46:07,915
Please, I must to my son.

861
01:46:20,935 --> 01:46:24,530
Burdon corroborates the whole deal.

862
01:46:24,606 --> 01:46:27,734
Mr. Behrani?
You're free to go.

863
01:46:27,809 --> 01:46:31,267
This is your recourse. You can press
charges against Deputy Burdon...

864
01:46:31,346 --> 01:46:33,576
Please, I must to hospital, please.

865
01:46:33,648 --> 01:46:35,343
Your son is at St. Vincent.

866
01:46:35,417 --> 01:46:38,648
He's three blocks east.
We can get a police escort!

867
01:46:45,260 --> 01:46:47,251
I want only my son.

868
01:46:48,797 --> 01:46:53,728
I want only my son.

869
01:46:56,037 --> 01:47:02,974
Emergency!

870
01:47:03,645 --> 01:47:06,775
Emergency!

871
01:47:06,848 --> 01:47:09,749
I must see my son.
He is here.

872
01:47:09,818 --> 01:47:11,786
- He has been shot.
- His name?

873
01:47:13,855 --> 01:47:16,050
What's his name, sir?

874
01:47:16,524 --> 01:47:18,185
Behrani.

875
01:47:19,661 --> 01:47:21,253
Esmail.

876
01:47:21,329 --> 01:47:23,923
He's In trauma.
You can wait In the lounge.

877
01:47:32,073 --> 01:47:34,268
<i>Please, God, don't take my joon-am.</i>

878
01:47:34,342 --> 01:47:37,834
<i>I make my nazr. My nazr, hear me.</i>
<i>Please to hear me.</i>

879
01:47:37,912 --> 01:47:41,473
I will give everything to one
who is less fortunate.

880
01:47:41,549 --> 01:47:44,746
Yes! I will make it for the broken bird.

881
01:47:44,819 --> 01:47:47,083
<i>Please, God, I'm making nazr</i>
<i>to this woman.</i>

882
01:47:47,155 --> 01:47:48,816
To Kathy Nicolo.

883
01:47:48,890 --> 01:47:51,882
And I to you promise,
if you heal my son,

884
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:55,054
I will return her father's house.

885
01:47:55,130 --> 01:47:57,530
I will also give to her
all the money I have.

886
01:47:57,599 --> 01:48:01,467
<i>My God, Khoda.</i>
<i>I make nazr only for my son.</i>

887
01:48:01,536 --> 01:48:03,902
Please, I want only for my son.

888
01:48:03,972 --> 01:48:06,964
I beg you, I will do whatever is your will.

889
01:48:07,041 --> 01:48:09,509
I will purchase ten kilos
of the finest seed

890
01:48:09,577 --> 01:48:13,741
and find an American mosque, and I will
feed them to all the birds outside.

891
01:48:13,815 --> 01:48:16,978
I will let the birds cover me
and peck out my eyes.

892
01:48:18,119 --> 01:48:20,451
<i>Please, God, my nazr is In your hands.</i>

893
01:50:37,992 --> 01:50:40,483
<i>Hi.</i>
<i>You've reached the Burdon family.</i>

894
01:50:40,561 --> 01:50:43,257
<i>We're not here right now,</i>
<i>but if you leave a message...</i>

895
01:50:43,331 --> 01:50:45,595
<i>we'll call you right back!</i>

896
01:50:49,137 --> 01:50:51,002
Let's go, Burdon.

897
01:52:10,847 --> 01:52:14,681
- Nadereh.
- Hmm?

898
01:52:16,186 --> 01:52:18,313
Massoud.

899
01:52:48,351 --> 01:52:49,648
Drink this.

900
01:52:51,554 --> 01:52:54,216
Some tea.

901
01:53:40,670 --> 01:53:43,195
I am tired.

902
01:53:48,078 --> 01:53:52,811
Soon we will return
to the flowers of Isfahan...

903
01:53:53,883 --> 01:53:55,544
the mosques of Qom...

904
01:53:56,686 --> 01:53:59,917
and to the fine hotels
of old Tehran.

905
01:54:06,996 --> 01:54:11,262
I have taken us so far off our course.

906
01:54:11,334 --> 01:54:14,201
But now it is time to return.

907
01:54:14,270 --> 01:54:18,104
It is time for us to go home,

908
01:54:18,174 --> 01:54:20,369
to our destiny.

909
01:59:16,939 --> 01:59:18,270
Oh, God!

910
01:59:39,361 --> 01:59:42,421
Oh, God!

911
02:00:10,392 --> 02:00:12,986
Please!

912
02:01:24,066 --> 02:01:26,534
Are you Kathy Nicolo?

913
02:01:29,137 --> 02:01:30,570
Yeah.

914
02:01:31,873 --> 02:01:33,636
Is this your house?

915
02:01:41,950 --> 02:01:45,613
No, it's not my house.
