1
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,400
- I'm so tired.
I could sleep a thousand years.

2
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,400
- Don't worry.
You'll pick up again tonight.

3
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,100
- It hasn't changed much here.

4
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,900
- It has changed.

5
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,900
It changes slowly.

6
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,900
- How?

7
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,900
- It changes slowly.
That's all.

8
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,800
- Wait.

9
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,700
I'd like to talk to you.

10
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,900
- I'm listening.

11
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,400
Is this a proposal?

12
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,400
The jewel, is it a proposal?

13
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,200
You stare at me...

14
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,400
And seem to want to hurt me.

15
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,200
Then your face
turns normal again.

16
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,800
It's the old you.

17
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,700
You continue to stare at me.

18
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,100
And then...

19
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,900
I feel you're coming.

20
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,600
As you come between my thighs,

21
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,100
I feel your sperm rise up
within me

22
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:43,300
and fill me
and flow out through my eyes.

23
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:48,100
There are white tears,
thick ones, coating my cheeks.

24
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,800
My mouth is red,

25
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,100
and the white tears
trickle over it.

26
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,900
I don't want to wipe them away.

27
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,200
I cry so much.

28
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,900
I can't stop crying.

29
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,500
You don't have an emerald?

30
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,400
- No, I don't have an emerald.

31
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,400
- Maybe next time.

32
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,400
- Maybe.

33
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,100
You always remember
your dreams?

34
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,500
No.

00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,200
? And I know a man ?

48
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:24,000
? Should be stronger ?

? Down that aisle together ?

52
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:42,200
? Whoa, all I need ?

53
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,800
? Is your promise ?

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:51,700

- Near the mirror.

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,700
Near the mirror, Clothilde.

66
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,100
- I'll show you.

67
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,000
- Pass me a hairpin?

68
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,200
- Leave me some.

69
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,400
- Don't worry.

70
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,300
- He's nice but heavy.

71
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,500
Physically heavy too.

72
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,500
When he's on top of me,
I'm crushed.

73
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,200
- I hope he hasn't given me
the clap.

74
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,200
- Claptrap.

doesn't come tonight.

I'm sick of him.

77
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,300
Three times in a row.
What a drag!

78
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,500
Always asking what I think
of his crooked cock,

79
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,400
before I kiss his ass.

80
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Who did you have?

81
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,000
- Michaux.

82
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,900
- He's sweet on you.
- For now he is.

83
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,300
It's only been twice.

84
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,200
- He doesn't want me now.

85
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,400
- Do you like him?

86
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,700
- Yes, I like him.

87
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,900
- That's all?
- It's something.

88
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,800
- You like him or you think
he could pay your debts

89
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,200
to get you out?

90
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,800
- Is that a problem?

91
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,800
Maybe I have fewer debts
than you.

92
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,000
- I doubt it.

93
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,600
- Sir...

94
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,100
- Good evening.

95
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,900
- Mine doesn't work.

96
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,300
- You lose!

97
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,000
- There.

98
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,400
- Can we come closer?
- Of course.

99
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,800
She's very meek.

100
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,200
I call her Ninon.

101
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,300
- A female?
- Yes.

102
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,100
- Alla vostra!

103
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,700
- Show me your hands.

104
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,700
- You won a point?

105
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,700
- Yes, my blow got me the...

106
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,400
- Doctor, you've lost.

107
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,500
- You have to drink.
- I've lost?

108
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,400
- See you later.

109
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,800
- I just finished
an amazing English novel,

110
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,100
full of aliens and Martians...

111
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,800
who invade Earth using rays
and chemical weapons.

112
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,700
They're very powerful

113
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,700
and easily eliminate
human beings.

114
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,600
They devastate the cities...

115
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,900
But not being immune
to human diseases,

116
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,600
they end up dying...

117
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,500
The story is told
by a journalist

118
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,700
who escapes the first attacks

119
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,800
and who seeks his wife
in a deserted land.

120
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,800
Idiotic but pure genius.

121
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,100
Have you read it?

122
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,500
- No, my only books are
Sade's diaries and the Bible.

123
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,600
And I haven't read the Bible.

She drew a self-portrait.
She's pretty.

141
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,200
- A pretty drawing
means nothing.

142
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,200
- May I?

143
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,400
- Yes.

144
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,400
- Very nice, Marie.

145
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,700
I'd like to be here
to welcome her.

146

- She's a baby.

147
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,200
- With the countess dead,

148
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,300
who'll be
the 20th century's beauty?

149
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,400
- I say you are.

150
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,900
- What was that?

151
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
- The Jewess is the new beauty.

152
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,400
- Thank you.

153
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,200
- Il mio maestro.

154
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,000
I've missed you.

155
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,900
- Caca, I was here two days ago.

156
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,900
- But not yesterday.

157
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,400
Where were you?

158
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,600
- With my wife.

159
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,300
- No!

160
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,700
The shame of it...

161
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,200
- It's been two weeks.

162
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,900
- I stayed in.

163
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,200
I wasn't in the mood for it.

164
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,800
- And now?
Are you in the mood?

165
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,600
- Very much.

166
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,200
- I had an odd dream about you
last week.

167
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,200
- All the girls say that.

168
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,800
- I swear, it's true.

169

- What was it?

170
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,800
- It's rather unusual.

171
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,400
- Want to tell me upstairs?

172
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,400
- I'd like that.

173
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,200
Get drinks and come to the room
with black curtains.

174
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,600
- What are you doing?

175
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,100
- It's a gift.

176
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,600
- I'm so tired.
I could sleep a thousand years.

177
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,500
- Don't worry.
You'll pick up again tonight.

178
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,500
- Give me a glass?

179
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,100
- Which one?
- I don't mind.

180
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,500
- Got any antiseptic soap?

181
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,500
- I can't afford any.

182
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,200
- And you?
- You're a pain.

183
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,200
I'll lend you some,
but buy your own.

184
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,600
- Thank you.

185
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,400
- Clothilde?

186
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,300
Can you help me?

187
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,100
Hold this.

188
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,500
Thanks.

189
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,400
- What are you doing?

190
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,900
- It's a gift.

191
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,300
- What's wrong?

192
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,900
- Nothing's wrong.

193
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,400
No one knows
what you're thinking.

194
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,500
- I don't think anything.

195
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,800
- She's nearly done.

196
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,300
- Send her to me after.

197
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,500
She's as pretty
as a blazing flower.

198
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,600
- My fingers must be cursed...

199
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,800
- The sound of the sirens...

200
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,900
- I start to undress.

201
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,300
And you put a box down
on the bed.

202
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,100
A tiny box.

203
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,000
I open it.

204
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,600
There's an emerald inside.

205
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,400
You still say nothing,
so I'm convinced that...

206
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,000
Well, I ask if it's a proposal.

207
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,100
You don't reply.

208
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,000
- That's it then.

209
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,200
Loubet has pardoned Dreyfus
at last.

210
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,000
- If the talk turns to Dreyfus,
I'm going up.

211
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,200
- Come on.

212
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,700
Let's go up.

213
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,700
- With pleasure.

214
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
- Shall we have commerce?

215
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,600
- I'd love to.

216
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,700
- You always remember
your dreams?

217
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,800
I want to tie you up.
May I?

218
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,700
- Yes, you may.

219
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,800
- He's envious of everything.

220
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,100
I'm happy with you.

221
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,800
- Vuitton...

222
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,200
- Vuitton...

223
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,100
- What?

224
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,800
Vuitton?

225
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,000
- I love saying that name.

226
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,100
He's a genius.

227
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,200
- Vuitton.

228
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,600
- I love this song.

229
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:09,000
"March 1900."

230
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,800
"The dawn of the 20th century."

231
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,600
- Spread your thighs.

232
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,800
Go on, spread them.
- No!

233
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:55,700
- I need to see inside your sex
to paint you.

234
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,000
Even to do your face.

235
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,100
It's very important.

236
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:08,000
Men never look into
the sex of women enough.

237
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,200
There...

238
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,300
I'm beginning to see
the picture.

239
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,000
I have the impression
I've painted your face 40 times.

240
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,900
This face...

241
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,900
This face...

242
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,800
You smell nice.

243
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,400
- Jicky by Guerlain.

244
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,000
- I know.
I loved a woman who wore it.

245
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,100
- I'm not jealous.

246
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,300
- How old are you?

247
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,900
- Why do you ask?

248
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,300
- So I'll know.

249
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:20,400
- I'm 28.

250
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,600
- How long have you been here?

251
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,500
- 12 years.

252
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:33,100
- I'll leave this here.

253
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,100
It's for you.

254
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I really have to go.

255
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,400
- It moved!

256
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,900
It moved!

257
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,800
- Even with two I lose.

258
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,900
It's pathetic!

259
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,600
- How are you, children?

260
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,800
Say hello to Pauline.

261
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,100
Okay, girls?
Met Pauline?

262
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,100
- We saw her earlier.

263
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,600
- Chinese arm lock!

264
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,100
- You didn't get me.

265
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,200
- Where are you off to?

266
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,400
- Maurice is taking me out
for the afternoon.

267
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,500
- Lucky you.
I want to go out too.

268
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,300
- Hello.

269
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,600
- Caca...

270
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,000
- Julie, please.

271
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
My name's Julie.
- Everyone calls her Caca.

272
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,800
- My name's Julie.

273
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,600
What are you doing
with my doll?

274
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,000
Bimba, dame un po'.

275
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,100
Don't touch it!

276
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,800
- You are pretty.

277
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,900
You went for your permit?

278
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,900
- Yes, before I came here.

279
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,900
- They examined you?

280
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:45,100
- I'm perfectly healthy.

281
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,700
- Any scars?

282
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,400
- No.

283
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,500
- Your breasts...

284
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,900
Are they firm?
- Very.

285
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,100
- Even without a corset?
- They're firm.

286
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,900
- All right.

287
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,800
You have your permit?
- Yes, I told you.

288
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,300
My papers are in order.

289
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,800
- Undress, please.

290
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,600
- Now?
- Yes, get used to it.

291
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,600
You're not here to make jam.

292
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,500
How old are you now?
- 16.

293
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,500
I have a letter from my parents.

294
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,200
- Do you speak well?

295
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,900
You're polite?
- Yes, I've been taught.

296
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,300
- Can you read?
- Yes.

297
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,300
- And write?
- Yes.

298
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,200
- Go on.

299
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,700
Turn round.

300
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,600
Nice buttocks.

301
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,100
Nice breasts.
- I'm young.

302
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,300
- You mustn't slim.

303
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,400
Can you let your hair down?

304
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,300
Your voice...
- What about it'?

305
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,800
- It's a bit weak.

306
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,200
- I can try harder.
- Try.

307
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,200
- I'll manage it.
- Show me.

308
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,500
- If I say I'll manage it,
I will.

309
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,700
- This isn't a knocking shop.

310
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,100
- I know.

311
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,300
That's why I wrote to you.

312
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,500
- If you don't fit in,
I can't keep you.

313
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,600
You learn the job as you go.
It's not easy.

314
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,900
- Can I get dressed now?

315
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,600
- You have a nickname?

316
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,600
La Petite.
Will that do?

317
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,000
Do you have a lover?

318
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,900
- No lover.

319
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,200
- Are you a virgin?

320
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,000
Tell me.
It's not a problem.

321
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,200
I can check.

322
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,500
Are you a virgin?
- No.

323
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,300
- Why choose this place?

324
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,700
- To be independent.
To be free.

325
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,100
- To be free?
In a house of tolerance?

326
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,200
Freedom's outside, not here.

327
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,100
- To earn money of my own.

328
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,200
- Do you want to marry?

329
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,000
- No.
- Why are you lying?

330
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Don't fool yourself.

331
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,100
A man rarely marries
a prostitute.

332
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,100
- We all live together.

333
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,900
We're always together.

334
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,700
We're nice to each other,
respect each other.

335
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,800
All right?

336
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,000
We share beds.

337
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,900
You can sleep here.

338
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
There's room with Clothilde.

339
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,100
You stay until the clients go,

340
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,600
but get up when you want.

341
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,600
When you get up,
go down to the dining room.

342
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,500
You never go out alone.

343
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,200
Only with Madame or a man.

344
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,200
If you're alone outside,
that's soliciting.

345
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,500
At around 4:00, we wash.

346
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,700
We have to be clean.
Very clean.

347
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,600
Smell nice. Clean hair.

348
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:12,600
Soap your body and hair daily
and rub down with cologne.

349
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,400
Often we do it in pairs.

350
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,700
I wash you, you wash me...

351
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,400
I'll show you the creams.

352
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,300
A hairdresser comes at 6:00.

353
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,400
He can curl your hair,
dye it and so on.

354
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,700
You don't pay him.
Madame does.

355
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,900
If a client likes your hair
one particular way,

356
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,400
don't change it too often.

357
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,600
Come on.

358
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,900
If a client says you smell
or you're dirty,

359
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,600
Madame will fine you.

360
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,400
It'll only increase your debts.

361
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,900
So wash yourself.

362
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,700
We all buy our own perfume.

363
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:54,500
You don't use another girl's.
You buy your own.

364
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,300
After each client,

365
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,700
rinse your mouth with water
and a few drops of mouthwash.

366
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,700
It's strong, but it works.

367
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,500
- My name's La.
- Pauline.

368
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,600
- I know.

369
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,800
Welcome.

370
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:17,100
- When the client undresses,
discreetly check his cock.

371
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,400
Check for sores or spots.

372
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,000
Check his body for rashes too.

373
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,100
Any doubts, don't have sex.

374
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,100
After each job, wash your lips,

375
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,500
rinse and rub them
with cologne.

376
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,600
Ever used it?

377
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,200
- No.

378
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,800
- It stings, but that's normal.

379
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,800
- When you get to the room,
what do you do?

380
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,700
Talk?
- Yes, you talk.

381
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,100
You chat a little.

382
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,000
They might talk
about themselves.

383
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,700
You have another drink.

384
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,700
It helps.

385
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,600
Find out what he's like
and adapt.

386
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,700
- After a while,
you get the same ones.

387
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,600
- Just arouse them
and make them come.

388
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,400
But fake it during sex.

389
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,500
- Why?
- Because.

390
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,500
That's how we do it.

391
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,600
- Hello.

392
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,800
Pauline.

393
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,600
- Madeleine.

394
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,500
This is for you.

395
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,800
- What's that?

396
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,600
- A wine stain.
I can't get it out.

397
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,300
- Let me see.

398
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,800
I'll wear it anyway.

399
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,900
The old woman will only add it
to my debts.

400
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,600
- Tighter.
- Don't move.

401
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,400
- Looking for wrinkles?

402
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,700
Let me see.

403
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,200
No, you're fine.

404
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,200
Just a few around the eyes.

405
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,100
- That's okay.

406
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,100
You don't have one.

407
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,100
- They'll come.

408
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,800
- Want to try?

409
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,600
It helps with love.

410
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,500
- Good evening.

411
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,600
- I'm Jacques.

412
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,600
I follow you'?

413
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:25,100
- Did Madame buy you
from another house or not?

414
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,300
- No.

415
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,900
- You have no debts then.

416
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:33,300
- What were you before?
- A seamstress.

417
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,800
- I was a laundress.

418
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,400
It was torture, believe me.

419
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,300
My lungs are full of ammonia.

420
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,500
- What did you do before?

421
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,500
- Me?
I did nothing special.

422
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,200
- You're from the bourgeoisie?

423
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,400
- The petty bourgeoisie.
Very petty.

424
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,600
- You have no debts then.
- We all have debts.

425
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,800
- You work to pay them off.

426
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,300
- In your dreams.

427
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,500
She makes sure you never pay
them off and leave.

428
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,800
Even with a lot of clients,
you always need perfume...

429
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:13,100
- Go easy on that stuff.

430
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,900
- But, Madame,
Mondays are quiet.

431
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,900
It helps us relax.
- It won't be quiet for long.

432
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,900
Come on, up you get.

433
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,400
He's a new one.

434
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,600
Are you all right?
- Yes, fine.

435
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:32,700
- That's good.
Very good.

436
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,200
Just...

437
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:46,100
- Michaux could pay off
your debts.

438
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,300
- If he does, I'll marry him.

439
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,400
- The tall girl is popular.

440
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,300
Next to her, the Algerian.

441
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,200
Samira.

442
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,300
That young one there is 15.
She's a virgin.

443
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,100
I can send for a boy too.

444
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,600
19, very pretty.

445
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,200
He can be here in an hour.

446
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,200
- I need to think about it.

447
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,300
- Do you like champagne?
- Not really.

448
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,500
- But he loves it.

449
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,100
- Come on.

450
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,600
- It's cold.

451
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,700
- You'll get used to it.

452
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:54,400
You'll see, it's delicious.

453
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,800
- Very nice.

454
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,200
- It's wonderful here.

455
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,200
You see girls without corsets...

456
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,400
- La...

457
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,400
- Someone for you.
- Who is it?

458
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,200
- Victor.

459
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:49,300
Hurry up now.
He's in the blue room.

460
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:57,600
Michaux will be in at one.
Try to see someone else first.

461
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,400
When Pauline finishes,
check it went well.

462
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,100
- Why me?

463
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:14,000
So shall we have commerce?

464
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,800
- No, not today.
- Why not?

465
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,300
- Because.

466
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,700
- Pity.

467
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,100
Who did Charles go with?

468
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,600
- La.

469
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,200
- She milked the first one?

470
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,200
That other guy...

471
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,300
Who did he go with?

472
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,800
- No idea.

473
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,400
- Won't you sit down?

474
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,500
Can you lift your veil'?

475
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,300
What's your name?

476
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,100
- The Jewess.
- No. Your real name.

477
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,100
- Madeleine.

478
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,000
- I'm Jacques.

479
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,200
- Why did you come up?

480
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:54,300
- I paid for the night.

481
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,300
Does that hurt?
- No.

482
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,100
- How did it happen?

483
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:01,900
You don't have to tell me.

484
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,200
- It was a man...

485
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:11,400
A man I knew well.

486
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,200
We were in one of the rooms.

487
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,400
He asked if he could tie me up.

488
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,900
I said he could.

489
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,700
I played along.

490
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,900
And that was that.

491
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,500
- No one ever comes to see you?

492
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,200
- No.

493
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,000
- So what do you do here?

494
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,100
- I make the beds.

495
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,400
I help in the kitchen.

496
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:45,300
I help in the laundry.

497
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,500
I look after the girls.

498
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:53,500
- Does she hide you?
- No.

499
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,400
Why are you asking me all this?

500
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,600
- I don't know.

501
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,600
Didn't you want to have
a normal life?

502
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,900
Outside.

503
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,300
You could find a job.

504
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,000
I can help if you want.

505
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,500
- I don't know.

506
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,800
Do you want to make love or not?

507
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,700
I don't want to talk any more.

508
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:16,700
- Vuitton...

509
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:29,100
- Thank you again.
- My pleasure.

510
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,500
- I'll get my animal.

511
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,800
- I adore her.

512
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,700
- I've never had her.

513
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:03,400
- When she goes off you,
you get this.

514
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,800
- Pussy fur?

515
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,500
- Who were you with?

516
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,500
- My Julie.

517
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,400
Caca.

518
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,700
- How many?

519
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,400
- Four.
You?

520
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,300
- Six.

521
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,700
- Five.

522
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,100
- Three.

523
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,700
I'll never get out of here.

524
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,100
- Okay?

525
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,000
- This shit is sticky...

526
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,900
- Let me help.

527
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,400
What's this?

528
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:47,700
- It's not easy in a bathtub
but I'm okay.

529
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:50,900
- Want some ointment?
- I'm okay.

530
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,600
- Did it go well?

531
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,600
- I think so.

532
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:03,200
How do I clean the sperm
with the sponge?

533
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,300
- Use this cream and rub gently.

534
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,300
It stings but that's normal.

535
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,400
- It's so depressing.

536
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,400
It'll be dawn soon.

537
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,300
- I've drunk too much.

538
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,900
- Thank you.

539
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,900
- 80.

540
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,900
"Mr. Prefect,"

541
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,600
"I am a widow
raising two children."

542
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:18,500
"My duty is to provide for them
and make a decent living."

543
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,000
"As I advance in years,"

544
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:25,400
"finding a trade other than
the one I have is impossible."

545
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,200
"You know I run
a respectable house."

546
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:29,800
"My girls are healthy,"

547
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:33,200
"and we abide by the rules
for such houses."

548
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,200
"I know the law and uphold it."

549
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:39,400
"I've never offered a girl
to a politician"

550
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,500
"or used one for corruption."

551
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:45,000
"In a word, the house is clean."

552
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,600
"The landlord,
the notary Hallereau,"

553
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:50,200
"knows of your affection
for this house"

554
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,400
"and so demands
a large increase in rent."

555
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,600
"He refuses to negotiate."

556
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,700
"I paid for all the fittings."

557
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,000
"Business is now good."

558
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:05,100
"But this increase in rent
would force me into debt,"

559
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:09,200
"obliging me to sell up
and move out."

560
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,200
"I have no one else to turn to."

561
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:16,600
"Please allow me to make
a living and raise my children."

562
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:21,200
"Allow me the consolation
an indebted woman requires."

563
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,200
"Marie-France Dallaire."

564
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,600
- It reeks of sperm
and champagne here.

565
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,500
- Why do they call you Caca?

566
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,000
- Why do they call you Caca?

567
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,900
- Why am I Long Hair?

568
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,100
- Let's just say...

569
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:06,800
I have a specialty.

570
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:11,100
- I get the picture.

571
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:12,800
- Want to know anyway?

572
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,500
- Julie, we're eating!

573
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,800
- Why?

574
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,000
- Don't spoil it.

575
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,900
- Does it still hurt?

576
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:28,100
- Only a little at night now.

577
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,600
- Did Madame make you?
- No.

578
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:34,100
She asked me.

579
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,200
- And?

580
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:39,100
He paid for the night,
but didn't want sex.

581
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:40,600
- Why not?

582
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:45,300
- Probably, I just to see
the monster close up.

583
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:48,000
He was sweet.

584
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,300
He said he'd come back
next week.

585
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:51,600
But I don't believe him.

586
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,600
- Want to check in the cards?

587
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,900
- No, it's okay.

588
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,200
- Last night was
a real freak show.

589
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,000
I had one...

590
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,300
He keeps going to confession

591
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,100
to talk filth
to get the priest hard.

592
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,700
He wanks off at the same time.

593
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,300
- That's sick!

594
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:15,100
- I'd like to see
a brothel for women.

595
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:19,200
A great place with great men
who are hard all the time

596
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,600
and tell us we're pretty,

597
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,400
even if we're old
with saggy tits.

598
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:26,000
- We'd never ask
the stupid questions they do.

599
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:28,600
- Do you like my tits?

600
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,000
Do you like my big tits?

601
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,100
- What's "whore" in Arabic?

602
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,200
- "Zaniya"...

603
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:36,100
or "Qahba,"
depending how polite you are.

604
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,900
- What's the polite one?

605
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:42,300
- "Zaniya," the kept woman.

606
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:45,800
- I don't mind being
a kept woman.

607
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,400
- Is Maurice going to propose?

608
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,700
- Perhaps.

609
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:54,000
If his wife dies.

610
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,600
- Are you in love?

611
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:57,800
- No.

612
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,300
But he's sweet.

613
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:01,400
The other day,

614
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:04,100
we went to the Wepler
for oysters.

615
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:07,600
Then we went dancing.

616
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:11,300
Know what I told him?

617
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:13,400
"I would pluck out my eyes
for you"

618
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,700
"so you'd have more holes"

619
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,900
"to make love to me."

620
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,400
He loved that!

621
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,200
- Is this only for Madeleine?

622
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,800
- No, for all of us.

623
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:33,500
Four show the past,

624
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:37,500
four the present
and four the future.

625
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:01,400
- Oh, cazzo.

626
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,500
- No, it's all right.

627
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,500
That's the good spade card.

628
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,800
It means stability, luck,
security...

629
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,000
The nine of clubs
means a job, a situation.

630
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:15,100
The Queen is a kind woman.

631
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
There's a young man, single.

632
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,100
He's next to a diamond card.

633
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:30,700
There's a romantic project,
but it's upside down.

634
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,900
That means there's a problem.

635
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,100
A girl with long hair.

636
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,200
She's upside down too.

637
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,700
You have to be wary of her.

638
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:48,800
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

639
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:51,700
- That it's upside down.

640
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,700
- It's in relation
to the dealer.

641
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,900
- They're only cards.

642
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,600
- If you draw them,
they're more than that.

643
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,800
- You're a bit of a mystic?

644
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,900
- I want to stop.

645
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,900
- We've started, let's finish.

646
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:08,100
Come on, the future.

647
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,300
- What did they call you before?

648
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,900
- The Jewess.

649
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
- Which is the worst one?

650
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,700
- The ten.

651
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:18,800
- Do you like that?

652
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,500
- Yes.

653
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:55,900
- What do you want?

654
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:58,700
- To see the Woman Who Laughs.

655
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:00,800
- For sex or just to see her?

656
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:04,200
- To see her first,
then decide.

657
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,900
- Inside a room,
you do as you like,

658
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,200
but you see girls here for sex,
the normal way.

659
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:14,100
- I'd like La as a doll then.

660
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:21,200
- Come here.

661
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,800
You smell nice, my doll.

662
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:47,800
- Who did you have?

663
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,500
- Simon.
And you?

664
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:51,800
- Louis.

665
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:06,900
- Julie, no!

666
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,400
Help me!
Julie!

667
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,900
- I want the peach.

668
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,300
- Well?

669
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:38,000
- I'll get you!
You have to strip right now.

670
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,800
Catch.

671
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:57,900
Marie-France, where do
the clients get their money?

672
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:00,500
- In industry, textiles,
paper...

673
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,000
Family fortunes too.

674
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:04,900
Fortunes of the aristocracy.

675
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:06,300
- Are there a lot
of aristocrats?

676
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,000
- Yes.

677
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:10,000
We get a lot of aristocrats.

678
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,200
- What does Louis work in?

679
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,700
- Louis is in textiles.

680
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:16,800
He made his fortune
in textiles.

681
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:19,500
Michaux has a family fortune.

682
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:23,900
Charles is a family fortune too.

683
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:27,000
- Who's the richest one?

684
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,300
- The richest one?

685
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:32,400
Charles.

686
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:36,900
He doesn't spend the most,
but he's the richest one.

687
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,700
- Has he been coming long?

688
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:42,200
- Yes, since the days
when I worked at L'Apollonide

689
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:45,500
like you do.

690
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,000
- My back hurts.

691
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,200
I'm sick of his doll thing.

692
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:16,000
- Don't complain.
There's worse.

693
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,300
- I'm not saying that,
just that I'm sick of it.

694
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:21,400
- You do as you want.

695
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,600
You get rid of creeps
with a few pussy hairs.

696
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:28,100
My whole bush wouldn't do that!

697
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:43,300
- It feels like an eternity
since we had a day out.

698
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,600
It's me.

699
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,200
Give me your cigarette.

700
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:54,500
All right.

701
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:55,900
What is it?

702
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:59,100
I was thinking a Lanvin hat
would suit you.

703
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:01,000
Go on then, Polo.

704
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,900
Treat me to a hat.

705
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:09,400
The fresh air loosens you up.

706
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,400
Want a drop of champagne?

707
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,800
Please.

708
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:17,300
Want some too?

709
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,800
Yeah, okay.

710
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Gently!

711
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,600
Sorry.

712
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:28,000
Pardon me.

713
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,100
It slipped out.

714
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:30,800
Calm down, Polo.

715
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:33,000
Oh, you know...

716
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:37,200
I'm sorry, it's old age.

717
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:38,500
This is nice.

718
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:39,700
Oh, yes!

719
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:41,400
I feel so good!

720
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:45,800
- I don't think
I'll be here long.

721
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:47,500
- I said that too.

722
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,000
Now look at me.

723
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:51,200
- We'll see.

724
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:54,600
I don't have any debts yet.

725
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:57,500
- We'll see.

726
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:11,300
- "I understand
your sense of injustice,"

727
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:14,100
"and I've always given you
my support."

728
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:17,300
"But, as a prefect,
I can't work miracles."

729
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:22,300
"I cannot oppose
a landlord's decision."

730
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:25,500
- Good evening.

731
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:27,000
- Who's here this evening?

732
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,800
- The same ones.

733
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:33,200
Still want to see the Jewess?
- Pardon me?

734
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:37,200
- The Woman Who Laughs.
Want to go up to see her?

735
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:38,800
You can,
but it'll cost you more.

736
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:41,200
- No.
I was a bit tipsy last time.

737
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,400
Who else is there?

738
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:43,600
- Who else...

739
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:47,000
Sweetness, Clea, Climbing Rose,
Fine Thigh...

740
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:08,500
- Afterwords, women couldn't
compete in the games.

741
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:10,800
- Why not?

742
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,200
- Good question.

743
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:18,400
They were thrown from a rock
if ever they went there.

744
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:22,600
But now they can go.

745
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:25,500
- They couldn't go
because the athletes were nude.

746
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:28,400
Now they're dressed.

747
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:31,500
So women can take part.

748
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,700
- Will you go up with me
and another girl?

749
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,700
- Who?

750
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,600
- Anyone.
You choose.

751
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,400
- I don't know.

752
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:02,600
I'd rather go alone
if you don't mind.

753
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:16,600
- Shall I put you in my will?

754
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:23,900
Do you want to be in my will?

755
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:25,100
- No.

756
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:28,300
I want you to stay alive.

757
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:32,000
- If anyone here is alive,

758
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:34,600
I am.

759
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:41,500
- Good evening.

760
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,800
- Ah, Louis!

761
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:49,000
- A drink
or shall I call Samira?

762
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,900
- Both.

763
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:59,900
- "I understand
your sense of injustice,"

764
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,800
"and I've always given you
my support."

765
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:07,700
"But, as a prefect,
I can't work miracles."

766
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:19,400
- Thank you.

767
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,900
- Some women
have very large breasts.

768
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:26,700
They could have an accident,
knock themselves out...

769
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:28,200
- Yes, that's true.

770
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:31,000
- They could bandage them.

771
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:35,300
- It's not so much fun.

772
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:54,200
- Fine Thigh.

773
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,600
- Fine Thigh...

774
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:04,000
- Clothed or naked?

775
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:06,300
- I prefer you naked.

776
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:09,100
- It costs more.
- I know.

777
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:05,200
- Talk to me in Japanese.

778
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:10,600
Go on, make it up.

779
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:16,100
Make it up.

780
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:25,600
- More.

781
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:51,400
- What does that mean?

782
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:56,600
- It means my tongue
comes towards you.

783
01:14:56,700 --> 01:15:00,600
Slowly.
It slithers across the floor.

784
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,600
It slips under the bed.

785
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:05,200
It rises up the side of it.

786
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,200
It reaches your feet.

787
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:09,100
It licks them.

788
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:11,500
It glides up along your leg.

789
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:13,600
Along your thigh.

790
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,800
It reaches your sex.

791
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:17,900
It winds around it.

792
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,300
It swallows it completely.

793
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:23,200
Sword swallower.

794
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:29,400
- Your Japanese is very good.

795
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:38,600
Do you want some?

796
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:42,000
- You don't have to smoke it.

797
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,400
You can take a bit and eat it.

798
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:48,000
- It's okay, I know.

799
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,500
- I want to see you often.

800
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:25,300
- Won't Clothilde
be angry with me?

801
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:27,200
- I can see more than one girl.

802
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:32,000
Now stop asking questions
and talk to me in Japanese.

803
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,000
You're very young.

804
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,100
- Not that young.

805
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:52,300
- Really?

806
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:56,900
- Not many girls my age
have been fucked in champagne.

807
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:58,800
- Did you like it?

808
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:01,700
- I loved it.

809
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:14,000
- Men never look into the sex
of women enough.

810
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:26,500
Wonderful.

811
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:30,900
After one night with you,
I could kill myself.

812
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,800
- Say "Ah."

813
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:53,900
Good.

814
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:55,200
What's that spot?

815
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:56,500
- Nothing.

816
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:58,200
- Have you had it long?

817
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:00,200
- It's nothing.

818
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:01,200
- All right.

819
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:02,300
One month? Two?

820
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:03,800
- No, a few days.

821
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:06,800
- All right.

822
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,300
Any itching?

823
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:10,300
- No.

824
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:20,500
- No new rashes on your body?
- No.

825
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:23,900
- Let me take a look.

826
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:31,000
Let me see.

827
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:36,800
Lie down now
and let me examine you.

828
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:53,900
Let me see.

829
01:18:57,700 --> 01:19:01,300
Nothing around the anus.

830
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:04,300
I'll use the speculum now.

831
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:18,800
- If ever I get out of here,
I'll never make love again.

832
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:22,600
- No...
- Yes.

833
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:23,800
I have to examine you.

834
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,900
You have to lie down.

835
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:28,100
- No!
- I have to examine you.

836
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:29,800
I have to.

837
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:31,100
Come on.

838
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:32,600
Now spread your thighs.

839
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:34,800
No two ways about it.

840
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:38,500
I can't see your sex otherwise.
Come on now.

841
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,900
Look at me.

842
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:45,700
You have to lie down.

843
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:49,200
Lie down and spread your thighs.
You have to do it.

844
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:55,200
The cervix is fine.

845
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:57,500
Heavy but normal discharge.

846
01:19:57,500 --> 01:20:00,000
How about your period?

847
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:02,700
- It comes and goes.

848
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:04,700
- When did you last have it?
Two months ago?

849
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:05,800
Three?

850
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:07,800
- Not long ago.
I forget.

851
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:10,700
- Six months?

852
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:13,600
You don't have your period
any more?

853
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:15,900
- I'm not pregnant.

854
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:18,900
- Six months...

855
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:21,300
- I just don't have my period
any more.

856
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:23,600
- How about your period?

857
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,700
- Same thing.

858
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:27,800
It comes and goes.

859
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:29,400
- And you?

860
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:30,500
- Normal.

861
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:32,200
- And you there?

862
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:34,000
- Mine's fine.

863
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,700
- Let me examine you.

864
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:48,900
Lie down.

865
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,800
- Okay?
- Yes, I'm healthy.

866
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:22,400
- Well?

867
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:25,200
- I'm fine.
I'm healthy.

868
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:27,200
- And the others?

869
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:28,500
- I don't know.

870
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:29,700
- I swear...

871
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:34,100
- What am I supposed to do now?

872
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:36,600
You think they're not pregnant?

873
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,800
- No, I'm sure.

874
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:43,100
But, I'm sorry,
that girl there has syphilis.

875
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:57,400
- It's okay. I accept it.
- Bravo.

876
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:05,700
- I'd just like someone
to give me a hug.

877
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:20,600
I want a macaroon.

878
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:27,700
- What a shit job.

879
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:37,500
- Fucking is a fuck awful job.

880
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:16,500
- It won't be easy tonight.

881
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:18,100
- No.

882
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:21,000
- Have you seen my bracelet?

883
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:23,800
- Which one?
- The pearl one.

884
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:27,000
- I think I saw it in the box.

885
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:40,300
- I put a charm on her doll.

886
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:41,600
I got a needle and...

887
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,600
- It's not your fault, Samira.

888
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,400
It could have been me or you.

889
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:47,300
It's the clap.

890
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:49,900
- Samira, go down.
Louis will be here soon.

891
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:57,900
- Madame...

892
01:23:57,900 --> 01:23:59,300
I have my period.

893
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:01,300
- We're too busy.

894
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:02,800
Take a cold bath.
- Please...

895
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:03,900
- I can't.

896
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,800
I'm already one girl short
as it is.

897
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:09,900
You'll have to work more.

898
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:11,400
- Yes, Madame.

899
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:15,200
- And try to show
a little joy tonight.

900
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:17,200
All right?

901
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:23,500
- Tonight,
just pretend I'm dead.

902
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:27,900
? Baby ?

903
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:32,800
? I don't Wanna be the one ?

904
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:36,200
? That hurt you ?

905
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:39,800
? Mmmm ?

906
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:42,900
? Baby ?

907
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:46,600
? I don't Wanna be the one ?

908
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:52,100
? That causes you pain ?

909
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:56,000
? Hey, hey, hey, hey ?

910
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,200
? Somebody find me a preacher ?

911
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:01,200
? So I can buy the rights ?

912
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:04,800
? I Wanna love you ?

913
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:08,300
? Listen, baby ?

914
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:09,500
? I'm so...?

915
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:38,900
? Somebody find me a preacher ?

916
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
? So I can buy the rights ?

917
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,600
? I Wanna love you ?

918
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:45,000
- You really have a tiny head.

919
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,800
- So?

920
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,800
A tiny head is pretty,
isn't it?

921
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,900
- It's very pretty.
Charming.

922
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:53,800
You have a tiny head too.

923
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:55,100
- I'm sorry?

924
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:57,500
- The size of your head...

925
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:59,800
- My head is fine and delicate.

926
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:02,400
- I knew it.

927
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:07,700
A woman called Pauline Tarnowsky
has written a scientific study

928
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:09,500
on prostitutes.

929
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:12,800
She says their heads are smaller
than average.

930
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:15,400
The same is true of criminals.

931
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:17,200
- Really?

932
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:19,800
- I can lend it to you
if you want.

933
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:21,600
- If it's good.

934
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:24,500
- It's very good.

935
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:39,900
- Right now, a normal girl
goes for 300.

936
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:42,600
400 for a Negress.

937
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:44,900
Plus the debts.
- I can't.

938
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:47,600
Even keep Julie without working,
I can't.

939
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:50,500
Paris is too expensive now.

940
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:59,100
- I have a friend
who organizes special evenings.

941
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:02,500
The Woman Who Laughs
interests him.

942
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:23,500
- I want to pay off your debts.

943
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,500
- Five times six.

944
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:47,700
- Eight...

945
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:49,500
- 30...40.
- 40.

946
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:53,300
- Here you are.

947
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:55,000
- Five times seven?

948
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:58,000
No, five times nine.

949
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,400
- What time is it?

950
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:01,900
- It's only 8:00.
Go to bed.

951
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:04,900
You'll look like hell tonight.

952
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:07,500
Five times nine?

953
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:13,800
- You're still here?

954
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:15,900
- Will you sleep with me?

955
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:17,100
- No.

956
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:18,800
It's too late now.

957
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:19,900
Or too early.

958
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:24,000
- I didn't mean sex.
Just sleeping.

959
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:27,100
I don't want to go home.
I feel bad.

960
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:32,800
- Just sleep then?

961
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:34,300
At 8:00 a.m.,

962
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:38,200
there's no more commerce.

963
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:40,200
You can lie
between Samira and me.

964
01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:41,900
- I promise.

965
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:43,500
I'll be fine between you.

966
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:46,100
- La, go to bed.

967
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:47,800
- Sorry.

968
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:52,400
Good night.

969
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:55,700
- I can't bring myself
to go home.

970
01:28:55,700 --> 01:28:58,200
Where's Pauline?
- She's asleep by now.

971
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:02,700
- Who with?

972
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:06,100
Do you mind
if I stay here awhile?

973
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:09,000
If I go home, I'll be a wreck.

974
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,700
- You've gone off Clothilde?

975
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:11,900
- I don't know.

976
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:13,400
I adore her, but...

977
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:14,900
we don't have fun.

978
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:17,200
I make her sad.

979
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:20,200
But I'm very fond of her.

980
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:22,200
I love whores.

981
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:26,600
I find them wonderful.
They move me.

982
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:29,600
I'm happy with them.
Terrible, isn't it?

983
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:32,600
- I understand.

984
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:34,600
I understand you.

985
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:00,800
- It's occupied.

986
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:21,700
"Anthropometric Study
of Prostitutes and Thieves."

987
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:24,900
"Pauline Tarnowsky -1889"

988
01:32:08,900 --> 01:32:11,200
- Spread your legs.

989
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:15,100
So I can see you.

990
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:18,100
Tighter.

991
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:23,000
My geisha...

992
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:38,700
- "The prostitute
is a female criminal."

993
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:45,900
"We observe an encephalon
several millimeters smaller,"

994
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:47,700
"due to the fact"

995
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:51,700
"that prostitutes
have smaller heads."

996
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:58,700
"Consequently, this means they
have much less brain matter."

997
01:32:58,700 --> 01:33:02,000
"Their weak intelligence"

998
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,500
"and mental abnormality
is natural."

999
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:09,800
"The dull spirit of some
can become stupor in others"

1000
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:15,500
"and even attain
a state verging on idiocy."

1001
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:24,300
- Get up, Clothilde.

1002
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:30,400
- I'm fine here.
- You are?

1003
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:32,800
Stupefied, you're fine?

1004
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:38,400
You'll end up
in a Marseille brothel

1005
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:42,800
turning tricks
on a vermin-ridden mattress.

1006
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:45,300
- No.

1007
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:48,000
Know what I'm going to do?

1008
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:49,500
I'll sell myself

1009
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:51,600
to another house.

1010
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:55,600
For a high price,
so I can pay off my debts.

1011
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,400
- Of course.

1012
01:33:57,500 --> 01:34:01,900
No one will want your debts.

1013
01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:03,600
- Well, I'll sell my teeth.

1014
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:10,300
- A Marseille brothel,
with the clap.

1015
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:13,400
- Great.
Fine.

1016
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:17,600
We deserve the clap.

1017
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:20,000
We deserve our punishment.

1018
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,700
- Ooh.

1019
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:24,000
- I've been here 12 years.

1020
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,900
The clap will be a nice break.

1021
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:45,800
- Be brave.

1022
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:53,400
- Good-bye.

1023
01:34:57,100 --> 01:34:59,700
- My dear Julie...

1024
01:34:59,700 --> 01:35:02,100
my little Caca...

1025
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:03,800
it hurts me to write this

1026
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:08,400
because it will hurt you
to read it.

1027
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:11,000
You're ill, my little Julie,

1028
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,800
and I Wish I was there
to comfort you.

1029
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:17,800
But there are things

1030
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:26,300
Don't think I'm abandoning you.

1031
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:29,900
I'd never abandon someone
I cherish as much as you

1032
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:33,300
after all these months.

1033
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:37,200
But I must tell you this.

1034
01:35:37,300 --> 01:35:38,500
Our relations must change.

1035
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:41,600
I don't want to catch
your disease.

1036
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:45,000
I never hesitate
to sacrifice myself,

1037
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:50,500
but now that sacrifice
would hurt me and not help you.

1038
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:58,700
You know I cannot pursue
your disease.

1039
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:02,300
I think I have eluded it
as I have no symptoms,

1040
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:06,700
but I'm not safe yet.

1041
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:10,000
I have to Wait two more Weeks.

1042
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:15,700
Julie, if I were ill,
I would forgive you.

1043
01:36:15,700 --> 01:36:19,600
But no one in my family
has ever had such diseases,

1044
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:22,900
and I Wouldn't like
to infect others.

1045
01:36:22,900 --> 01:36:25,800
Men have secrets
but no mystery,

1046
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:29,300
and I'm so sorry,
my little Julie.

1047
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:31,900
I stiff love you,

1048
01:36:31,900 --> 01:36:36,600
even more now
because you're ill.

1049
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:41,100
Your loving friend, Maurice.

1050
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:43,000
- "Men..."

1051
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,500
"Men have secrets
but no mystery,"

1052
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:47,700
"and I'm so sorry,
my little Julie."

1053
01:36:47,700 --> 01:36:49,000
"I still love you,"

1054
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,500
"even more now
because you're ill."

1055
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:53,500
"Your loving friend, Maurice."

1056
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:55,100
- Where was it?

1057
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:56,200
- In the mail.

1058
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:57,700
- Tear it up.

1059
01:36:57,700 --> 01:36:59,000
She mustn't read it.

1060
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:05,400
- That's really sick.

1061
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:08,300
- I can keep her
because he's still paying.

1062
01:37:08,300 --> 01:37:11,500
Even if he no longer sees her.

1063
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:13,100
Any news of Pauline?

1064
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:15,500
- No.

1065
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:20,200
Is the house closing down?

1066
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:22,700
- I don't know.

1067
01:37:30,300 --> 01:37:33,300
- Does it suit me?

1068
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:21,400
- It's funny.
She looks like an old doll.

1069
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:23,100
- No, she's too thin.

1070
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:25,000
She's like a big puppet.

1071
01:39:25,100 --> 01:39:27,900
But I like her breasts.

1072
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,200
- Pinch her nipples

1073
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:06,300
to see if she stops smiling.

1074
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:45,700
- Has Pauline left,
or did something happen to her?

1075
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:49,200
- Could Madame have sold her
without saying?

1076
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:51,700
- Will she sell us one by one?

1077
01:41:58,700 --> 01:42:00,600
Will she sell us one by one?

1078
01:42:00,600 --> 01:42:03,300
- I don't know.

1079
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:09,100
God only knows
where we'll end up.

1080
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:13,200
Maybe in some seedy brothel,
with revolting clients.

1081
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:16,200
Especially past 25.

1082
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:33,100
- Looking at the freak?

1083
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:42,900
Forgive me.
I'm sorry.

1084
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:50,400
- You too.

1085
01:43:04,100 --> 01:43:05,800
I don't want to die.

1086
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:08,800
- You're not going to.
I promise.

1087
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:14,100
- I want to see Maurice.

1088
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:19,300
- He's going to come.
Soon.

1089
01:43:58,900 --> 01:44:04,400
? Letters I've Written ?

1090
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:09,600
? Never meaning to send ?

1091
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:13,900
? Beauty I'd always missed ?

1092
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:19,100
? With these eyes before ?

1093
01:44:19,100 --> 01:44:23,200
? Just what the truth is ?

1094
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:26,500
? I can't say any more ?

1095
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:31,100
? 'Cause I love you ?

1096
01:44:31,200 --> 01:44:34,200
? Yes,

1097
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:42,200
? Oh, how I love you ?

1098
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:51,800
? Gazing at people ?

1099
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:56,700
? Some hand in hand ?

1100
01:44:56,800 --> 01:45:01,000
? Just what I'm going through ?

1101
01:45:01,100 --> 01:45:06,100
? They can't understand ?

1102
01:45:06,100 --> 01:45:10,000
? Some try to tell me ?

1103
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:15,300
? Thoughts they cannot defend ?

1104
01:45:15,300 --> 01:45:19,700
? Just what you want to be ?

1105
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:23,000
? You will be in the end ?

1106
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:27,400
? And I love you ?

1107
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:30,600
? Yes,

1108
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:37,200
? Oh, how I love you ?

1109
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:42,200
? Oh, how I love you ?

1110
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:19,400
? Oh, how I love you ?

1111
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:24,100
I Oh, how I love you ?

1112
01:47:24,100 --> 01:47:27,300
? Oh ?

1113
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:32,000
? 'Cause I love you ?

1114
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,800
? Yes,

1115
01:47:34,900 --> 01:47:38,400
? Oh, how I love you ?

1116
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:41,400
? Oh ?

1117
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:46,400
? Oh, how I love you ?

1118
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:57,100
- I feel your sperm fill me up

1119
01:47:57,100 --> 01:47:58,700
and flow out through my eyes.

1120
01:47:58,700 --> 01:48:04,400
There are white tears,
thick ones, coating my cheeks.

1121
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:06,800
My mouth is red,

1122
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:10,900
and the white tears
trickle over it.

1123
01:48:10,900 --> 01:48:13,500
I don't want to wipe them away.

1124
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:14,600
I cry so much...

1125
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:16,800
I can't stop crying.

1126
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:18,900
You don't have an emerald?

1127
01:48:18,900 --> 01:48:20,700
- No, I don't have one.

1128
01:48:20,700 --> 01:48:22,900
I want to tie you up.
May I?

1129
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:30,300
Shh.

1130
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:56,200
- You were on the floor.

1131
01:48:56,200 --> 01:49:00,200
I picked you up.

1132
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:01,900
- Thank you.

1133
01:49:09,900 --> 01:49:13,400
- You said something
in your sleep.

1134
01:49:13,400 --> 01:49:17,300
- What did I say?

1135
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:19,300
- "If we don't burn,"

1136
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:21,700
"how will the night be lit?."

1137
01:49:21,700 --> 01:49:24,700
"Michaux..."

1138
01:49:24,700 --> 01:49:27,900
"my fragment..."

1139
01:49:27,900 --> 01:49:30,300
"meteorite."

1140
01:49:31,700 --> 01:49:33,200
- I said that?

1141
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:35,500
- Shh.

1142
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:42,800
Don't be afraid
to express your love.

1143
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:47,200
Don't be afraid.

1144
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:22,400
- What's your name?

1145
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:24,100
- Madeleine.

1146
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:26,300
- No nickname?

1147
01:50:26,300 --> 01:50:28,300
- Just Madeleine.

1148
01:50:36,100 --> 01:50:37,800
- Long live France.

1149
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:44,500
- Where will they go?

1150
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:47,500
- I've sold some
to other houses.

1151
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:49,800
A man has bought Samira.

1152
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:53,200
The others will do
what they can.

1153
01:50:53,300 --> 01:50:57,000
Enjoy them while they're here.

1154
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,100
- I'm not staying.

1155
01:50:59,200 --> 01:51:01,700
I'm in no mood for fun

1156
01:51:01,700 --> 01:51:03,900
I just wanted
to give you a kiss.

1157
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:16,800
- A new Jeanne Paquin dress?

1158
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:18,200
- Yes.

1159
01:51:18,200 --> 01:51:20,200
- You're ravishing.

1160
01:51:20,300 --> 01:51:24,200
- Thank you.

1161
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:26,900
Cheers.

1162
01:51:26,900 --> 01:51:30,100
- My favorite sound.

1163
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:33,900
- It's not crystal now,
just glass.

1164
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,600
- Never mind.

1165
01:51:35,600 --> 01:51:38,100
It's still champagne.

1166
01:51:38,200 --> 01:51:41,500
- You look wonderful.

1167
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,200
- Look, they're having fun now.

1168
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:52,500
- Do it.

1169
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:56,300
Go on.

1170
01:51:56,300 --> 01:51:59,800
- I attended the opening
of the metro yesterday.

1171
01:51:59,900 --> 01:52:01,100
It's horrendous.

1172
01:52:02,500 --> 01:52:04,400
It's dark, the seats are hard,

1173
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:06,000
and it's so grim.

1174
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,900
Everyone seemed happy.

1175
01:52:07,900 --> 01:52:10,200
Stupidly happy.

1176
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:13,900
They loved crossing Paris
underground!

1177
01:52:13,900 --> 01:52:16,600
It's appalling.

1178
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:21,900
I walked back from Porte Maillot
to Palais Royal.

1179
01:52:21,900 --> 01:52:23,900
I thought of you.

1180
01:52:23,900 --> 01:52:26,700
What will we do without you?

1181
01:52:26,700 --> 01:52:30,500
- You'll have other experiences.

1182
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:34,800
All the other houses
will be closing too.

1183
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:37,900
It's sad, but too bad.

1184
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,500
Today love is out
on the street.

1185
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:43,000
No one can stop that.

1186
01:52:45,700 --> 01:52:48,700
- What will you do now?

1187
01:52:48,700 --> 01:52:50,100
- I don't know.

1188
01:52:50,100 --> 01:52:53,500
I'm a bit tired.

1189
01:52:57,200 --> 01:53:02,300
- Promise to stay yourself,
even without L'Apollonide.

1190
01:53:02,300 --> 01:53:04,600
Keep the flowers, the music,

1191
01:53:04,700 --> 01:53:06,600
the fine dresses,

1192
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:08,700
the color, the champagne,

1193
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:10,800
even in glass...

1194
01:53:10,900 --> 01:53:13,900
Make noise, please.
We're going to need it.

1195
01:54:36,900 --> 01:54:38,900
- Have we met before?

1196
01:54:38,900 --> 01:54:41,400
- Perhaps.

1197
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:42,800
- I'd remember.

1198
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:44,600
What's your name?

1199
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:46,300
- Madeleine.

1200
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:56,600
- A little perfume...

1201
01:55:06,200 --> 01:55:08,700
- What are you like under there?

1202
01:55:08,700 --> 01:55:10,200
- However you want.

1203
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:13,000
How do you want me to be?

1204
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,300
- I don't know.

1205
01:55:14,300 --> 01:55:18,300
Aren't you asking me
what I'm like?

1206
01:55:18,300 --> 01:55:20,700
- No.

1207
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:48,500
- La?

1208
01:55:51,700 --> 01:55:53,600
- La's up in a room.

1209
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:00,900
- Hear that, Simone?

1210
01:56:00,900 --> 01:56:02,500
The fireworks?

1211
01:56:02,600 --> 01:56:06,200
It's the fireworks!

1212
01:56:18,300 --> 01:56:20,200
- Don't be scared.

1213
01:56:20,200 --> 01:56:21,600
My pretty Ninon...

1214
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:25,600
It's Bastille Day,
but no one's beheading you.

1215
01:56:26,700 --> 01:56:28,600
Musik bitte!

1216
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:06,500
- It's the fireworks!

1217
01:57:06,600 --> 01:57:10,200
- I want champagne.

1218
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:13,300
Musik bitte!

1219
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,600
- Come in.

1220
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:25,200
- You really do like it.

1221
01:59:36,700 --> 01:59:37,800
- I want to stop.

1222
01:59:37,800 --> 01:59:40,800
I don't like it any more.

1223
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:43,800
- I'm paying, so I decide.

1224
01:59:54,100 --> 01:59:55,600
- Shh.

1225
02:01:23,100 --> 02:01:27,800
- What will you do now?

1226
02:01:27,800 --> 02:01:30,800
- I don't know.

1227
02:02:04,200 --> 02:02:08,100
- This is a song
about a bad girl.

1228
02:02:08,100 --> 02:02:12,900
Something that happened to me
a long time ago.

1229
02:02:12,900 --> 02:02:14,500
Everybody was telling me

1230
02:02:14,500 --> 02:02:18,700
how the little girl
was running around.

1231
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:21,500
But I had a head of my own.

1232
02:02:21,500 --> 02:02:26,000
And I just Wouldn't listen
to nobody.

1233
02:02:26,100 --> 02:02:31,400
My father, he told me,
my mother said I would cry.

1234
02:02:31,500 --> 02:02:34,300
"Said, " Son, this Woman'//
break your heart,

1235
02:02:34,300 --> 02:02:38,100
and then she'll put you down."

1236
02:02:38,100 --> 02:02:40,800
That's when I told Mama
these Words.

1237
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:42,900
Lord, have mercy.

1238
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:48,600
? Bad girl, Mama ?

1239
02:02:50,500 --> 02:02:52,900
? Bad ?

1240
02:02:52,900 --> 02:02:58,200
? Bad girl ?

1241
02:02:58,200 --> 02:03:02,100
? Mama, they call her
bad girl ?

1242
02:03:02,100 --> 02:03:06,100
? All because she Wanted
to be free ?

1243
02:03:06,100 --> 02:03:09,900
? Mama, I'm in love
with the little girl ?

1244
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:13,000
? And I believe
that she loves me ?

1245
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:16,300
? What my heart feels,
my lips must confess ?

1246
02:03:16,300 --> 02:03:19,300
? That I would never
let her on ?

1247
02:03:19,300 --> 02:03:22,000
? I don't care
if they call her bad ?

1248
02:03:22,100 --> 02:03:25,300
? Bad girl, Mama ?

1249
02:03:25,300 --> 02:03:27,300
? Lord, have mercy ?

1250
02:03:27,400 --> 02:03:28,800
? A-ow! ?

1251
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:30,600
? Bad! ?

1252
02:03:30,600 --> 02:03:36,000
? Bad girl ?

1253
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:39,700
? Girl been a mystery ?

1254
02:03:39,700 --> 02:03:43,800
? Too bad to be explained
by anything ?

1255
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:47,700
? But I believe
one of these days ?

1256
02:03:47,800 --> 02:03:51,300
? The whole World
will understand ?

1257
02:03:51,300 --> 02:03:54,400
? What my heart feels
my lips must confess ?

1258
02:03:54,500 --> 02:03:57,700
? That I will never let
the little girl on ?

1259
02:03:57,800 --> 02:04:00,800
? I don't care
if they call her bad ?

1260
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:02,700
? Bad girl ?

1261
02:04:02,700 --> 02:04:05,300
? You gotta believe me, Mama ?

1262
02:04:05,400 --> 02:04:06,600
? A-ow! ?

1263
02:04:06,600 --> 02:04:08,500
? Bad! ?

1264
02:04:08,500 --> 02:04:13,200
? Bad girl ?

1265
02:04:13,200 --> 02:04:15,200
? Ah! ?

1266
02:04:15,200 --> 02:04:17,600
I Ah!
Whoa! ?

1267
02:04:21,800 --> 02:04:24,300
? Bad! ?

1268
02:04:29,300 --> 02:04:36,700
? Bad girl, Mama ?

1269
02:04:36,800 --> 02:04:38,900
? Bad! ?

1270
02:04:38,900 --> 02:04:40,500
? Bad girl ?

1271
02:04:40,500 --> 02:04:43,700
? Lord, have mercy ?

1272
02:04:43,700 --> 02:04:46,900
? Oh, bad ?

1273
02:04:46,900 --> 02:04:49,600
? Bad, bad girl ?

1274
02:04:49,700 --> 02:04:51,500
? Lord ?

1275
02:04:51,600 --> 02:04:53,200
? A-ow! ?

1276
02:04:53,200 --> 02:04:54,900
? Bad! ?

1277
02:04:54,900 --> 02:04:56,600
? Bad girl ?

1278
02:04:56,600 --> 02:04:59,900
? A-ow! A-ow! A-ow! ?

1279
02:04:59,900 --> 02:05:01,900
? Bad! ?

1280
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:03,900
? Bad girl ?

1281
02:05:03,900 --> 02:05:07,400
? Lord, have mercy ?

1282
02:05:07,500 --> 02:05:10,000
? Bad! ?

1283
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:13,600
? Bad girl ?

1284
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:15,700
? Whoa, oh ?

1285
02:05:15,700 --> 02:05:17,800
? Bad ?

1286
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:20,300
? Bad girl ?

1287
02:05:20,400 --> 02:05:22,100
? Whoof ?

1288
02:05:22,100 --> 02:05:24,300
? Lord! ?

1289
02:05:24,300 --> 02:05:28,200
? You Won't understand
what I'm saying... ?
