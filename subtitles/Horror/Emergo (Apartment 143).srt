1
00:00:03,975 --> 00:00:07,236
(June) I've always been someone
Who can wear a lot of different hats,

2
00:00:07,356 --> 00:00:09,115
Like here in apartment 23.
(beeps)

3
00:00:09,235 --> 00:00:11,388
Sometimes I need to be
a mixologist...

4
00:00:11,877 --> 00:00:13,953
Sometimes I need to be
a teacher...

5
00:00:19,197 --> 00:00:22,935
And sometimes I need to be
the bearer of bad news.

6
00:00:24,283 --> 00:00:25,641
What up? (sighs)

7
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,612
I'm sorry to have to tell
you this, but...

8
00:00:27,658 --> 00:00:28,980
You decided to get a pixie cut?

9
00:00:29,004 --> 00:00:29,913
What? No.

10
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:31,838
Oh, thank God.
My heart is still racing.

11
00:00:32,139 --> 00:00:33,775
Feel that? That's fear.

12
00:00:34,808 --> 00:00:37,158
Well, what I was gonna tell you was...
(bottles clink, cabinet closes)

13
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,496
Your plant died.

14
00:00:38,543 --> 00:00:40,728
What plant? I hate plants.
I don't have no plant.

15
00:00:40,848 --> 00:00:43,423
Sure you do. You got one
about a month ago.

16
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:49,210
I'm all about the environment.
I fancy myself a tree hugger.

17
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,985
Oh, right. Ethan. He was my
emergency contact for a month.

18
00:00:53,105 --> 00:00:56,221
Well, I don't know how it died.
I watered it all the time.

19
00:00:57,102 --> 00:00:58,821
With water from your goldfish's bowl?

20
00:00:58,941 --> 00:01:01,061
What goldfish? I hate goldfish.
I don't have no goldfish.

21
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,357
(clinks)
Ooh!

22
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,722
(chuckles) I'm all about the goldfish.
Wanna have sex?

23
00:01:08,889 --> 00:01:12,156
Weird fair. A lot of weird booths
at that weird fair.

24
00:01:12,814 --> 00:01:13,777
(sighs)

25
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:15,970
Well, remind me never
to trust you

26
00:01:16,021 --> 00:01:18,271
With taking care of anything
of mine, Chloe. (chuckles)

27
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:19,822
Oh. What's that?

28
00:01:20,865 --> 00:01:24,669
Mm. "Chloe, thanks for looking
after my great-uncle in apartment 14."

29
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:26,931
"He needs his daily shot
of insulin."

30
00:01:27,674 --> 00:01:30,262
(siren wails in distance,
police radio chatter)

And we analyze companies'

37
00:01:45,998 --> 00:01:48,443
Ms. Berman, if you give me
this opportunity,

38
00:01:48,563 --> 00:01:51,232
I will show you how committed I am
To Berman, Marks and Mathers.

39
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,177
Even though this is
an unpaid internship,

40
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,473
It requires 7 days a week,
24 hours a day.

41
00:01:55,593 --> 00:01:57,331
- Okay.
- When I sleep, which is rare,

42
00:01:57,369 --> 00:01:59,240
I do so standing up,
like a cow.

43
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,206
My time is yours.
I'm single.

44
00:02:01,244 --> 00:02:03,472
I don't have any pets,
and my only hobby is

45
00:02:03,512 --> 00:02:05,449
The seasonal raising
of window box pansies.

46
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:06,349
- Stop it.
- I will.

47
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:06,892
Excellent.

48
00:02:07,112 --> 00:02:10,257
You will also be required
to do a few personal things for me...

49
00:02:10,438 --> 00:02:12,762
Pick up my dry cleaning,
meet with my contractor.

50
00:02:12,802 --> 00:02:13,982
How are you at giving haircuts?

51
00:02:14,027 --> 00:02:15,253
Great. I'm great at it.

52
00:02:15,524 --> 00:02:16,727
You start tomorrow.

53
00:02:20,277 --> 00:02:21,232
- Burma.
- Nice.

54
00:02:21,352 --> 00:02:22,767
- Uzbekistan.
- Awesome.

55
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,072
- Sweden.
- Great.

56
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:25,452
Not a country.
That's a crab.

57
00:02:25,496 --> 00:02:26,756
Good for you!
(chuckles)

58
00:02:26,788 --> 00:02:27,713
You're so smart!
(door opens)

59
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,691
I got the internship!
(chuckles)

60
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,981
If I nail this,
I'll be back in the game.

61
00:02:32,182 --> 00:02:32,886
Of course, it's unpaid,

62
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,552
So there's that and working
at the coffee shop,

63
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,766
But it's okay,
'cause I'm a great multitasker.

64
00:02:37,082 --> 00:02:38,090
What... what... is that smoke?

65
00:02:38,323 --> 00:02:40,624
Oh, yeah. There's a small
grease fire in the oven.

66
00:02:40,657 --> 00:02:43,506
What?! What? God!

67
00:02:43,626 --> 00:02:46,177
You have to smother the flames!

68
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:48,266
Oh, my gosh!
The whole place...

69
00:02:48,304 --> 00:02:51,328
(coughing)
could have burned down!

70
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,357
Well, I was gonna make a pizza,
and then I passed out,

71
00:02:54,387 --> 00:02:56,872
And when I woke up, I was like,
"I don't make pizzas."

72
00:02:56,932 --> 00:02:59,122
(laughs) She doesn't.

73
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,025
Chloe, you have to learn
to be more responsible.

74
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:04,960
Do you not see a pattern here?

75
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,602
You see something
that you want,

76
00:03:06,722 --> 00:03:08,794
And then you abandon it
because you get bored

77
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:11,797
or because you're too selfish
to care about anyone else!

78
00:03:11,917 --> 00:03:14,495
June, I'm interested
in what you're saying.

79
00:03:14,555 --> 00:03:16,934
Write it down and put it in
the basket next to the toilet.

80
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:19,467
I'll get to it as soon
as my busy season's over.

81
00:03:19,587 --> 00:03:22,147
"Busy season."
You don't even have a job.

82
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:26,335
In the span of 3 days,
I make 70% of my annual income.

83
00:03:26,455 --> 00:03:28,329
When the U.N. holds
its general assembly,

84
00:03:28,366 --> 00:03:30,987
I am the nightlife guide
for dignitaries.

85
00:03:31,107 --> 00:03:32,965
I know just enough
of every language to drink

86
00:03:33,023 --> 00:03:35,630
and dance with powerful men
from all over the world.

87
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:37,459
It's a ton of work,
and, frankly...

88
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,903
Me encuentra un peu
bukan zhongfu.

89
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:41,029
Huh?

90
00:03:41,149 --> 00:03:42,453
That means
"I'm feeling overwhelmed"

91
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:44,101
In spanish, french,
and mandarin.

92
00:03:44,255 --> 00:03:46,300
I really wanted to wing
some tagalog at you,

93
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,941
But I don't know
the pluperfect.

94
00:03:49,305 --> 00:03:52,283
Mm.
(horn honks)

95
00:03:52,474 --> 00:03:53,993
(indistinct conversations)

96
00:03:54,113 --> 00:03:55,741
Oh, hey.
You got the internship?

97
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:57,636
That's great.
I know you really wanted it.

98
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,538
Yeah, I'm really excited,
but it's gonna be a lot of work.

99
00:03:59,552 --> 00:04:01,120
- I think Pepper's stealing coffee.
- What?

100
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:04,509
It's, uh... hi.
Pepper, hi. (chuckles)

101
00:04:04,862 --> 00:04:07,969
Wednesday. Hump day.
It's hump day, dump day!

102
00:04:08,044 --> 00:04:09,557
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

103
00:04:10,365 --> 00:04:12,568
(dishes and utensils clinking)
(sighs, lowered voice)

104
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,608
I can't fire her because we have
a strict corporate dismissal policy,

105
00:04:15,642 --> 00:04:17,058
And she's extremely litigious.

106
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:18,417
(lowered voice)
Oh, that's right.

107
00:04:18,475 --> 00:04:21,180
She uses the word "allegedly"
far too often.

108
00:04:21,463 --> 00:04:25,045
Um, someone allegedly ordered
a pumpkin spice, no whip.

109
00:04:26,295 --> 00:04:28,537
I've installed security cameras
to catch her in the act,

110
00:04:28,657 --> 00:04:30,122
So since I can't trust her,

111
00:04:30,146 --> 00:04:32,290
I'm gonna need you to take on
more responsibility...

112
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,217
Morning muffin deliveries,
closing at night.

113
00:04:34,261 --> 00:04:36,888
- Do you think you can handle that?
- Absolutely. (chuckles)

114
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:38,923
The more I have to do,
the better I get things done.

115
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,214
In high school,
I maintained a 4.0 G.P.A.

116
00:04:42,334 --> 00:04:44,262
While writing a musical.
It was called "Kick it up!"

117
00:04:44,382 --> 00:04:45,392
It was about
an all-girls kickball...

118
00:04:45,423 --> 00:04:47,496
So angry at her,
I kinda don't care.

119
00:04:51,486 --> 00:04:55,256
Ohh. Sorry I'm late.
Things have been so crazy.

120
00:04:55,376 --> 00:04:57,273
The general assembly
convenes tomorrow,

121
00:04:57,325 --> 00:04:58,454
So I had to rent a monkey.

122
00:04:58,897 --> 00:05:01,073
Italians love it
when I bring a monkey.

123
00:05:01,322 --> 00:05:02,276
Italians.

124
00:05:03,286 --> 00:05:04,309
Hmm. I said yes to a movie.

125
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,163
It's called "In papa's arms."
it's gonna be amazing.

126
00:05:06,283 --> 00:05:08,434
It stars the one and only
Kiernan Shipka.

127
00:05:08,554 --> 00:05:09,584
What are those words?

128
00:05:09,704 --> 00:05:10,966
The little blonde girl
from "Mad men."

129
00:05:11,156 --> 00:05:12,463
She's the one actor
I've been dying to work with.

130
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:13,707
She's got this quiet intensity.

131
00:05:13,827 --> 00:05:16,367
She's like a... like a small,
blonde Daniel Day-Lewis.

132
00:05:16,602 --> 00:05:18,423
- Is the script any good?
- No idea.

133
00:05:18,543 --> 00:05:20,472
I just said "yes" the minute
I heard Kiernan was on board.

134
00:05:20,592 --> 00:05:22,298
Luther's reading it right now.
He'll tell me what he thinks.

135
00:05:22,418 --> 00:05:24,101
- You can have Luther do that?
- Of course.

136
00:05:24,221 --> 00:05:25,418
Luther reads all
my scripts for me.

137
00:05:25,538 --> 00:05:27,333
"She slams the door behind her,

138
00:05:27,373 --> 00:05:30,398
Causing alex to get his hand
stuck in the fondue pot."

139
00:05:30,518 --> 00:05:33,253
(chuckling)
"Alex... 'a little help here?'"

140
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:37,797
"fondue pot." I mean...
"Check, please!"

141
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,992
This is quality television.

142
00:05:40,112 --> 00:05:43,479
You can have Luther read
you stories?

143
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:46,456
Yeah. He's my assistant.
He does whatever I need him to do...

144
00:05:46,835 --> 00:05:48,057
Eat questionable sushi,

145
00:05:48,177 --> 00:05:49,769
tickle my forearm
while we're watching TV,

146
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:51,143
carry me over puddles.

147
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,255
(girl) uh-huh. Uh-huh.

148
00:05:57,747 --> 00:06:00,845
Okay. Thank you. All set.

149
00:06:00,965 --> 00:06:03,609
You have drinks with the foreign
minister of Panama at 9:00.

150
00:06:03,626 --> 00:06:06,348
Then dancing and dessert with the
ambassador to Myanmar at 10:00.

151
00:06:06,468 --> 00:06:10,099
Fine. Now we just need to find
an outfit that works for both events.

152
00:06:10,142 --> 00:06:13,750
Panama likes it slutty, but Myanmar
likes to keep it classy.

153
00:06:14,731 --> 00:06:16,401
What... what's going on?
(gasps)

154
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:19,020
oh, June. Great news.
(thuds)

155
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,416
I thought about what you said,

156
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:23,141
About needing to be
more responsible, so...

157
00:06:24,683 --> 00:06:25,783
I got an assistant.

158
00:06:25,992 --> 00:06:27,852
What?
H-how can you afford that?

159
00:06:27,925 --> 00:06:30,261
Oh, it's free.
I got a foster child.

160
00:06:31,841 --> 00:06:34,890
Molly, F.Y.I.,
we have a no flip-flop policy,

161
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:37,699
So I'm gonna need to see you
in a closed-toe shoe.

162
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,097
Thank you.

163
00:06:39,717 --> 00:06:43,098
(whispers) it's amazing!
(door closes)

164
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,154
(whispering) What the hell?
(slurps) You got a foster child?!

165
00:06:52,274 --> 00:06:52,652
Yep.

166
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:55,328
I needed some assistant work
during my busy season.

167
00:06:55,376 --> 00:06:57,959
I figured, why not a kid
that needs a home?

168
00:06:59,323 --> 00:07:02,843
Now I know why people like
kids so much. They're handy.

169
00:07:03,365 --> 00:07:05,583
But you'll see.
You'll see when you have one.

170
00:07:06,046 --> 00:07:07,564
How did you do this?

171
00:07:07,964 --> 00:07:09,921
I know, right? Usually you
have to be on the list

172
00:07:09,955 --> 00:07:11,204
for, like, a year, but luckily,

173
00:07:11,324 --> 00:07:13,511
my friend special K.
works in child services,

174
00:07:13,536 --> 00:07:14,728
so she hooked me up.

175
00:07:14,848 --> 00:07:17,631
You know, I don't tell her enough,
but she's a great gal.

176
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:20,065
Molly, let's send her
a cookie bouquet.

177
00:07:20,185 --> 00:07:21,961
How about
a smoked sable platter?

178
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,284
Outside the box.
I like it. Let's do it.

179
00:07:24,404 --> 00:07:24,728
Okay.

180
00:07:24,787 --> 00:07:27,258
Chloe, this is insane.

181
00:07:27,327 --> 00:07:29,934
This is beyond irresponsible.

182
00:07:30,188 --> 00:07:31,338
You can't keep her.

183
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:33,508
You want to throw molly back
out on the streets,

184
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,069
back to her junkie mother,

185
00:07:35,348 --> 00:07:37,595
instead of taking her in
and loving her

186
00:07:37,715 --> 00:07:40,500
until she goes on to play
college football for ole miss?

187
00:07:41,363 --> 00:07:43,136
That is the premise
of "The blind side."

188
00:07:43,312 --> 00:07:44,491
This is my responsibility.

189
00:07:44,521 --> 00:07:45,839
You won't even notice
that she's here...

190
00:07:46,273 --> 00:07:47,864
(lowered voice) Although she
does play the french horn.

191
00:07:47,984 --> 00:07:49,804
(chuckles)
Okay. You know what?

192
00:07:49,828 --> 00:07:53,016
It's fine. I don't care.
You do what you want to do.

193
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,572
I have my own stuff
to deal with, so...

194
00:07:54,614 --> 00:07:58,003
I've got it under control.
Now if you'll excuse me,

195
00:07:58,123 --> 00:08:00,417
I have a very busy 72 hours
coming up.

196
00:08:00,476 --> 00:08:01,083
Okay.

197
00:08:01,203 --> 00:08:02,759
Molly.
Kimono.

198
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:04,799
Burka.

199
00:08:06,232 --> 00:08:07,301
Sombrero.

200
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,657
Hello, Joyce.
I picked up your dry cleaning,

201
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:18,430
I got your coffee, and I marked
our quarterly report,

202
00:08:18,446 --> 00:08:20,347
and it's ready for review
and signature.

203
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:21,336
Walk with me.

204
00:08:22,922 --> 00:08:24,210
Uh, yes.

205
00:08:25,293 --> 00:08:27,286
(whirring)

206
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,196
I'm impressed with you, June.
(keypad beeps)

207
00:08:29,222 --> 00:08:30,916
I'm usually the last one
to leave the office,

208
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:33,238
but I was in here late last night
and saw you working.

209
00:08:33,483 --> 00:08:34,771
Didn't you hear me as I passed?

210
00:08:34,978 --> 00:08:36,728
I was wearing my sweater
with the little bells on it.

211
00:08:36,848 --> 00:08:37,621
No, I didn't.

212
00:08:37,688 --> 00:08:39,316
I thought so.
You didn't say bye.

213
00:08:39,974 --> 00:08:42,927
My point is, I'm impressed with
the dedication you're showing.

214
00:08:43,047 --> 00:08:44,847
I want you to help out
with the toy-con account.

215
00:08:44,967 --> 00:08:45,949
It's a lot to slog through.

216
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:48,100
Think you can handle it?
Absolutely. (chuckles)

217
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,147
I am a great multitasker.

218
00:08:50,378 --> 00:08:52,407
(chuckles) Juggling is not
just a fun pastime

219
00:08:52,444 --> 00:08:54,871
That destroyed my wrists.
It is a way of life.

220
00:08:55,138 --> 00:08:57,208
Great. Oh, and by the way,

221
00:08:57,682 --> 00:08:59,890
lot of compliments.
- Oh. (chuckles)

222
00:09:02,026 --> 00:09:04,384
(beeping)

223
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,271
"...Giving a new meaning
to the term 'daddy's girl.'

224
00:09:09,235 --> 00:09:12,632
Fade out." (exhales deeply)
"The end."

225
00:09:14,697 --> 00:09:17,154
Wow. It's the one version
of body swap movie

226
00:09:17,274 --> 00:09:18,897
that's never been attempted
before...

227
00:09:19,752 --> 00:09:22,398
Father and daughter.
(sighs)

228
00:09:23,502 --> 00:09:24,985
But can I pull it off?

229
00:09:25,282 --> 00:09:27,382
I mean, I've never been
a 12-year-old girl before.

230
00:09:27,977 --> 00:09:29,859
I've had tons
of 12-year-old girl fans,

231
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,820
countless stalkers, thousands of
dreams where I was one,

232
00:09:33,069 --> 00:09:34,385
But I don't know
if I could become one.

233
00:09:34,505 --> 00:09:36,544
You just need to prepare.

234
00:09:36,664 --> 00:09:40,629
Like with any role, you have
to be around a preteen girl,

235
00:09:40,749 --> 00:09:42,183
Get inside her head,

236
00:09:42,303 --> 00:09:44,687
And who better to teach you

237
00:09:45,181 --> 00:09:47,790
than La Shipka herself?

238
00:09:48,701 --> 00:09:51,095
Luther, clear my schedule.

239
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,069
We need to make
cinematic history!

240
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,980
Sir, it has been clear
for weeks.

241
00:09:58,482 --> 00:10:00,297
(horns honk)

242
00:10:00,997 --> 00:10:02,171
(sighs) ohh.

243
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,024
(door closes)

244
00:10:03,073 --> 00:10:04,239
What's going on?
Where's Chloe?

245
00:10:04,427 --> 00:10:05,974
May I tell her who's asking?

246
00:10:06,509 --> 00:10:08,264
- It's June.
- June...

247
00:10:08,818 --> 00:10:10,649
- Got it.
- Uh, she's in Seattle.

248
00:10:10,672 --> 00:10:12,970
The argentinean diplomat
is a fan of "Grey's Anatomy."

249
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,198
Wait. What? She just
left you here like that?

250
00:10:16,986 --> 00:10:17,807
Unbelievable.

251
00:10:17,972 --> 00:10:18,851
Oh. I'll get her for you.

252
00:10:19,148 --> 00:10:21,281
(beeps)
Hi. I've... I've got June.

253
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:22,441
(lowered voice)
I'm putting her through.

254
00:10:22,484 --> 00:10:24,535
(cell phone rings)

255
00:10:24,744 --> 00:10:25,322
(beeps)

256
00:10:27,068 --> 00:10:27,647
Chloe.

257
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:30,736
Hi. Who knew Seattle was
so rainy? Brr.

258
00:10:30,786 --> 00:10:32,018
What the hell are you doing?!

259
00:10:32,073 --> 00:10:34,059
Um, working.
My busy season?

260
00:10:34,107 --> 00:10:35,649
You can't just take off
to Seattle.

261
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:37,879
You have a child.
You have responsibilities.

262
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,005
Um, that's why I have a child,

263
00:10:40,049 --> 00:10:42,010
Because I have
responsibilities.

264
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,819
- Molly, are you there?
- I'm here, Chloe.

265
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,689
Can you extend my trip
for a day?

266
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:47,408
I just need some time
to myself.

267
00:10:47,463 --> 00:10:49,414
Okay, do you want to be
On the same flight back,

268
00:10:49,469 --> 00:10:50,859
just one day later, or...

269
00:10:50,873 --> 00:10:52,717
Figure it out, Molly. Bye.
(beeps)

270
00:10:52,738 --> 00:10:53,218
(sighs) ohh.
(beeps)

271
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:55,426
This is the last thing
that I need to deal with.

272
00:10:55,758 --> 00:10:57,193
I have to go
through the toy-con account,

273
00:10:57,212 --> 00:10:59,041
and mark wants me to look over
security camera footage

274
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:00,124
of Pepper weighing the beans.

275
00:11:00,196 --> 00:11:00,989
Have you eaten yet?

276
00:11:02,183 --> 00:11:03,679
Great. I'll just do it.

277
00:11:04,343 --> 00:11:05,441
Mm. This is so like Chloe,

278
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,071
leaving you here eating
chocolate for dinner.

279
00:11:08,438 --> 00:11:11,646
Sorry. I shouldn't disparage
your guardian in front of you.

280
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:14,765
Relax. I left my last home
when "20/20" broke down the door

281
00:11:14,814 --> 00:11:15,684
To do an expose.

282
00:11:15,804 --> 00:11:17,259
This is like a slumber party.

283
00:11:18,289 --> 00:11:20,566
I am so sorry.
I think I saw that episode.

284
00:11:25,732 --> 00:11:27,108
(door opens)

285
00:11:27,903 --> 00:11:31,165
Ah. (sighs) I'm home.

286
00:11:31,841 --> 00:11:35,126
Oh, Molly,
did you intend to book me

287
00:11:35,146 --> 00:11:37,133
at a hotel with
the scratchiest towels

288
00:11:37,153 --> 00:11:39,130
in Seattle, or was
that a coincidence?

289
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:40,307
I-I'm sorry. (chuckles)

290
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:43,209
Hey, you're home!

291
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:45,158
(lowered voice) This is exactly
what I didn't want to happen!

292
00:11:45,197 --> 00:11:47,461
What, you not knowing how
to apply eyeliner?

293
00:11:48,515 --> 00:11:50,589
No. You abandoning Molly.

294
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,798
This is just like
your goldfish or your plant.

295
00:11:52,918 --> 00:11:56,490
As if I didn't have enough to do,
you leave me with your kid.

296
00:11:56,524 --> 00:11:57,954
Wow, June. Unbelievable.

297
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,819
I love how, when you're upset,
she's my kid.

298
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,395
She's your kid, too, you know?

299
00:12:01,515 --> 00:12:01,910
What?

300
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,436
Oh. I said
we were lesbian co-parents.

301
00:12:05,006 --> 00:12:07,310
Come on, June, you moved in
the first day we met.

302
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,112
I bagged me quite the trophy.

303
00:12:09,232 --> 00:12:10,536
Oh!

304
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,631
(door closes)

305
00:12:18,845 --> 00:12:21,930
Of course I had to say we were
lesbian lover co-parents.

306
00:12:21,973 --> 00:12:24,196
They never would have given
a kid to a single mom

307
00:12:24,239 --> 00:12:25,697
who doesn't have
an "official job."

308
00:12:25,719 --> 00:12:27,937
How did you make me
a co-parent with me knowing?!

309
00:12:28,057 --> 00:12:29,761
Don't you remember
When that social worker

310
00:12:29,804 --> 00:12:31,972
came by the house to see
if we were fit parents?

311
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:33,873
You mean that woman
that came to interview us

312
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:35,103
for that apartment blog?

313
00:12:35,152 --> 00:12:38,541
And over here is our bookshelf
made of reclaimed wood...

314
00:12:38,568 --> 00:12:39,001
Ah.

315
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,481
And this over here is
our reading nook.

316
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:42,023
(chuckles)

317
00:12:42,066 --> 00:12:43,990
We're in between cats
at the moment.

318
00:12:44,012 --> 00:12:46,604
That's why there's no fur.
Mm.

319
00:12:48,678 --> 00:12:50,824
So that paper that I signed
was not a photo release?

320
00:12:50,873 --> 00:12:53,242
That was you getting
a foster kid.

321
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,863
That was the moment
you got a kid.

322
00:12:56,822 --> 00:12:59,301
- Anyway, it's a moot point.
- What do you mean?

323
00:12:59,334 --> 00:13:00,835
Well, now that
my busy season's over,

324
00:13:00,873 --> 00:13:02,050
I don't need the extra help.

325
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,427
Plus, she wasn't
a great assistant.

326
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,367
I mean, every day
between 9:00 and 3:00,

327
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:06,736
I could not get ahold of her.

328
00:13:06,774 --> 00:13:10,833
Ohh. She was at school.
You cannot fire your daughter.

329
00:13:10,904 --> 00:13:13,162
Lord knows this is not
the best time for me

330
00:13:13,282 --> 00:13:14,636
With my job and my internship,

331
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:17,354
But we have
a responsibility to Molly...

332
00:13:17,474 --> 00:13:19,376
Hi. We were just talking.

333
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,303
We're not fighting.

334
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:22,242
Is... is everything okay?
Do you need anything?

335
00:13:22,307 --> 00:13:24,036
I-I need someone
to make me a costume.

336
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:26,112
I'm playing the dragon
in "Flower drum song."

337
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,879
(inhales deeply)
oh, I would love to,

338
00:13:27,906 --> 00:13:29,891
but I'm actually making
a dragon costume

339
00:13:29,913 --> 00:13:32,311
For somebody else.
They just asked, so...

340
00:13:32,338 --> 00:13:33,411
(sighs)
(chuckles)

341
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,422
(horns honk in distance)

342
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:41,375
(whispers) what time is it?

343
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:42,815
Oh.

344
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,737
(lowered voice)
uh, joyce. (chuckles)

345
00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:49,796
- What?
- Um... (chuckles)

346
00:13:49,837 --> 00:13:52,818
I-I was wondering if, uh...
I can't hear you.

347
00:13:52,858 --> 00:13:55,377
Um, uh, I-I hate to...
I hate to do this,

348
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,247
but I-I actually...
- Can you hear her?

349
00:13:57,281 --> 00:13:57,763
No, joyce.

350
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,159
You see?
She can't hear you either.

351
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,618
Neither michelle nor I
can hear you.

352
00:14:01,652 --> 00:14:02,760
(normal voice)
I hate to do this,

353
00:14:02,787 --> 00:14:04,827
But I have something
I need to go do at 4:00.

354
00:14:04,979 --> 00:14:06,159
My daughter's in a play.

355
00:14:06,215 --> 00:14:08,627
Daughter? You never mentioned
you had a kid.

356
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:11,003
Okay. Uh, well, my roommate
unwittingly signed me up

357
00:14:11,031 --> 00:14:12,336
for a foster child,
and she has a play,

358
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,811
and I don't want her to look out
and see an empty chair.

359
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:17,868
Your roommate unwittingly signed
you up for a foster child,

360
00:14:17,894 --> 00:14:19,656
And she has a play,
and you don't want her

361
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:21,614
To just look out there and see
an empty chair?

362
00:14:22,868 --> 00:14:26,214
June, June, June, June, June,

363
00:14:26,237 --> 00:14:29,033
June, June, June, June.

364
00:14:30,435 --> 00:14:31,531
June.

365
00:14:33,775 --> 00:14:34,758
(doorbell rings)

366
00:14:38,115 --> 00:14:39,994
Kiernan, hey. Come on in.

367
00:14:40,032 --> 00:14:41,418
Thank you so much for coming.

368
00:14:41,646 --> 00:14:42,766
Can I get you something
to drink?

369
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,093
I don't really have
any kid drinks,

370
00:14:44,132 --> 00:14:46,128
But, uh, I-I could just
give you some coffee.

371
00:14:46,157 --> 00:14:47,193
You could sip it
through a straw.

372
00:14:47,227 --> 00:14:47,907
Sure. Thanks.

373
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:49,992
I heard, uh, Jon Hamm's
really good at basketball.

374
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,117
Is that true?
Is January Jones a robot?

375
00:14:52,237 --> 00:14:53,241
Can I have your boots?

376
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,652
Chloe, Kiernan is here
so that we can work.

377
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:58,686
Fine. Guess I'll just read
a script or something.

378
00:14:59,714 --> 00:15:00,686
"Check, please!"

379
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:01,831
That sounds fun.

380
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,685
All right. Have a seat.

381
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:10,893
So my agent called and said you
wanted to hang out and study me?

382
00:15:11,105 --> 00:15:12,746
Yeah. Yeah, since we're,
uh, you know,

383
00:15:12,776 --> 00:15:13,869
We're swapping bodies
in the movie,

384
00:15:13,915 --> 00:15:15,768
I just figured,
uh, I should, you know,

385
00:15:15,888 --> 00:15:18,510
kinda get inside your head
and, you know,

386
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,932
See where you're coming from,
get my tween on.

387
00:15:21,052 --> 00:15:22,489
- Don't say that.
- No?

388
00:15:22,609 --> 00:15:24,578
Well, I-I heard it a lot
at the Kids' Choice Awards.

389
00:15:24,698 --> 00:15:25,694
I got slimed in '04.

390
00:15:25,814 --> 00:15:27,137
(chuckles)
That's so long ago.

391
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,899
Guys, listen to this.

392
00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:31,724
Alex and jane are really nervous
because the food critic

393
00:15:31,762 --> 00:15:33,797
is coming to their restaurant
on opening night.

394
00:15:33,917 --> 00:15:37,471
Then Javier accidentally
deep-fries a pair of glasses,

395
00:15:37,517 --> 00:15:40,729
And they say, "Javier, you need
to be more responsible."

396
00:15:40,912 --> 00:15:43,831
That's exactly
what June said to me!

397
00:15:43,951 --> 00:15:47,226
I'm Javier,
and Molly is the glasses!

398
00:15:49,426 --> 00:15:51,439
Don't mind Chloe.
She's totes cray-cray.

399
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:52,844
Don't say that either.

400
00:15:53,368 --> 00:15:55,880
When June said it, I thought it was
the dumbest thing I'd ever heard,

401
00:15:55,918 --> 00:15:58,698
but somehow, reading it
In this television script

402
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:02,349
by... These three jews,
It suddenly hit home.

403
00:16:02,533 --> 00:16:04,777
Sometimes, things don't click

404
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,154
Until Hollywood really
spells them out for you.

405
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:09,950
- Ahem.
- Ahem.

406
00:16:10,023 --> 00:16:11,564
- Stop it.
- Stop it.

407
00:16:11,729 --> 00:16:13,636
- No, seriously.
- No, seriously.

408
00:16:13,756 --> 00:16:14,414
(sighs)
(sighs)

409
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:20,329
(indistinct conversations,
espresso machine gurgles)

410
00:16:20,923 --> 00:16:23,982
Okay. Vanilla latte.
That'll be $3.50.

411
00:16:24,612 --> 00:16:27,233
Miss, please don't pour
your coffee into the trash hole.

412
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:30,074
I asked "room for cream?"
for this very reason.

413
00:16:30,194 --> 00:16:32,231
Pepper, can I have a little help
up here? I'm swamped.

414
00:16:32,263 --> 00:16:33,429
No! (chuckles)

415
00:16:33,496 --> 00:16:35,969
Pepper is not handling cash
or coffee anymore, June.

416
00:16:36,011 --> 00:16:37,058
You know that.

417
00:16:37,088 --> 00:16:39,570
So is your daughter gonna
be here all day?

418
00:16:39,594 --> 00:16:41,121
Because there's kind
of a policy... (sighs)

419
00:16:41,157 --> 00:16:42,804
against employees bringing
kids to work.

420
00:16:42,828 --> 00:16:45,637
(sighs) I'm so sorry. I just...
I couldn't find a sitter.

421
00:16:45,703 --> 00:16:48,096
Hey, Robin. Can you please
babysit for me?

422
00:16:48,126 --> 00:16:48,769
No. Busy.

423
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:52,075
Don't worry. She won't get
in the way. (mouths words)

424
00:16:52,705 --> 00:16:54,694
Can you take off
parental controls?

425
00:16:54,742 --> 00:16:56,348
- No.
- Can I buy "tiny wings"?

426
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,913
No.
(bells jingling)

427
00:16:58,033 --> 00:17:00,327
- June.
- Oh! Look who's here.

428
00:17:00,363 --> 00:17:00,856
(door closes)

429
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,732
First you flaked
on molly's play,

430
00:17:02,786 --> 00:17:05,026
and then I ask you
to take her to jazz class,

431
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,556
and you said you would,
and you did not.

432
00:17:06,676 --> 00:17:08,524
Look, I thought about
what you said,

433
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:10,804
and I don't just exist
in a vacuum,

434
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,336
And I really need to take
responsibility for my own actions.

435
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:16,689
Well, I... th...
I mean, that... that's great.

436
00:17:16,943 --> 00:17:18,605
I'm... I'm really glad
that you feel that way.

437
00:17:19,244 --> 00:17:20,897
Okay, so molly needs
new kneepads

438
00:17:21,017 --> 00:17:22,693
for her floor routine,
so I'm gonna need,

439
00:17:22,739 --> 00:17:24,459
Um, I'm gonna need a check
for half of that.

440
00:17:24,475 --> 00:17:25,882
No. I can't do it.
I don't want to.

441
00:17:26,002 --> 00:17:28,936
You! You! You have not
changed at all.

442
00:17:29,056 --> 00:17:31,599
It's one thing to realize that
you're a parent philosophically,

443
00:17:31,641 --> 00:17:33,601
But it's another thing
to be a parent.

444
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:36,150
You need to commit to this.
You are either in

445
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,455
or you are out, Chloe.

446
00:17:37,575 --> 00:17:40,648
Oh. Then I am out. I didn't
realize I had a choice. Thanks.

447
00:17:40,678 --> 00:17:41,664
(cell phone rings)
you...

448
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,198
(bells jingling, beeps)

449
00:17:43,517 --> 00:17:46,078
Hello? Hi. Hi, Joyce. Hi.

450
00:17:46,104 --> 00:17:48,269
I'm so sorry I forgot to e-mail
you those toy-con documents.

451
00:17:48,284 --> 00:17:49,199
I'm still at work...

452
00:17:49,738 --> 00:17:52,226
What? No. No!

453
00:17:52,459 --> 00:17:54,728
Look, okay, look,
I know I have a kid,

454
00:17:54,781 --> 00:17:57,058
But I can do this job
just as... just as well

455
00:17:57,095 --> 00:17:58,425
As any other employee.

456
00:17:59,568 --> 00:18:01,366
No, I-I didn't know
that michelle had

457
00:18:01,396 --> 00:18:03,214
an inhospitable womb,
but you know what?

458
00:18:03,254 --> 00:18:05,468
I-I don't think it's fair
that you reward her for that.

459
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:09,245
Ma'am! Ma'am, please don't pour
that coffee down the hole.

460
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,962
Where do you think
the liquid goes?

461
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,065
Joyce? J...
(whispers) crap!

462
00:18:13,103 --> 00:18:13,392
(beeps)

463
00:18:13,464 --> 00:18:14,627
Is chloe mad at me?

464
00:18:14,656 --> 00:18:16,584
Because I asked her
if she wanted to roll calls,

465
00:18:16,608 --> 00:18:18,763
and she said I'm not
her assistant anymore.

466
00:18:18,956 --> 00:18:20,365
Honey, no.

467
00:18:20,687 --> 00:18:22,599
You're not
her assistant anymore.

468
00:18:22,628 --> 00:18:25,342
You're our... well...
(chuckles) you're my child,

469
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:28,032
And you know what?
You and I are gonna be just fine.

470
00:18:28,922 --> 00:18:29,549
(sighs) That's too bad,

471
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:31,780
Because working for chloe
was fun, and you're kinda lame.

472
00:18:31,824 --> 00:18:33,312
You have a lot of rules.

473
00:18:34,467 --> 00:18:36,501
Lame? You think I'm lame?

474
00:18:37,064 --> 00:18:39,231
After everything I've done
for you? (chuckles)

475
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,443
I mean, I spent 19 hours...
(chuckles)

476
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:43,478
Sewing you a dragon costume,
and, you know,

477
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,720
Sewing you a dragon costume,
and, you know,

478
00:18:45,783 --> 00:18:47,001
To go to your play.

479
00:18:47,198 --> 00:18:50,704
(raised voice) I work two jobs
to give you a life,

480
00:18:50,752 --> 00:18:53,897
And no one cares...
Not you, not Chloe,

481
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:56,316
not Joyce, not Lucky, Lucky,

482
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:57,701
sterile Michelle!

483
00:18:58,052 --> 00:19:00,748
Would it kill anyone
to say thank you,

484
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,687
To look over at me and say,

485
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:07,069
"June, hey, we see you,
we see you, and thank you"?!

486
00:19:08,036 --> 00:19:10,154
Your breath smells
when you yell.

487
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,540
Your breath smells
when you yell!

488
00:19:12,564 --> 00:19:14,884
(screaming) Your breath smells
when you yell!

489
00:19:14,912 --> 00:19:18,433
Your breath smells
when you yell!

490
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,380
Oh, my god.
She's shaking her baby.

491
00:19:20,443 --> 00:19:22,434
You sucked
in "Flower drum song"!

492
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:27,115
You're killing your mother!
Why?!

493
00:19:32,815 --> 00:19:35,329
(gasps, panting)

494
00:19:35,449 --> 00:19:39,032
- Oh, what happened?
- Shh. Shh.

495
00:19:39,152 --> 00:19:40,243
You blacked out.

496
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:42,958
You're overworked.
You took on too much.

497
00:19:43,435 --> 00:19:46,609
Did I shake our baby?
Yeah. Yeah, you did.

498
00:19:46,729 --> 00:19:49,694
- Oh, my God. Is she okay?
- Don't worry.

499
00:19:49,732 --> 00:19:52,164
I took care of it.
I used the it's just beans

500
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:53,930
security footage
of you shaking Molly

501
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,212
to prove to child services that
you're an unfit mother.

502
00:19:56,438 --> 00:19:58,369
You'll never be able
to lead a girl scout troop

503
00:19:58,399 --> 00:20:00,106
or sponsor a hungry child.

504
00:20:00,144 --> 00:20:02,799
Oh, God. My baby.

505
00:20:02,853 --> 00:20:03,778
Don't worry.

506
00:20:03,898 --> 00:20:06,395
She's going on
to a good, stable home.

507
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,193
I used my connections
and hooked her up

508
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,085
with the ambassador to Morocco
and his wife.

509
00:20:10,129 --> 00:20:11,798
They've been trying
to adopt for years.

510
00:20:12,161 --> 00:20:14,199
Everyone who's ever worked
on my desk goes on

511
00:20:14,243 --> 00:20:15,522
to bigger and better things.

512
00:20:16,109 --> 00:20:19,502
Wow. For once, you cleaned up
your own mess.

513
00:20:19,533 --> 00:20:22,275
Yeah, well, after I saw you
freaking out at the coffee shop,

514
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:24,320
I realized it was
because of something I had done,

515
00:20:24,339 --> 00:20:27,543
and I do need to take responsibility
for my own actions.

516
00:20:27,711 --> 00:20:30,710
I guess you needed more responsibility,
and I needed less.

517
00:20:31,739 --> 00:20:34,468
I thought I could handle it,
but I guess I can't.

518
00:20:34,962 --> 00:20:35,530
(chuckles)

519
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,647
Remember when I thought
I could take care of a plant?

520
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,987
Ha! (laughing) I couldn't even
take care of a kid.

521
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:42,331
What am I gonna do
with a plant? (laughs)

522
00:20:44,983 --> 00:20:46,331
Ah. Molly.

523
00:20:46,701 --> 00:20:49,786
She really is gone.
It's so quiet.

524
00:20:51,424 --> 00:20:54,225
Hmm.
(sniffs)

525
00:20:55,764 --> 00:20:56,909
(door closes)

526
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:11,339
You embarrassed me
in front of Jenkins

527
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,006
At the business meeting today.

528
00:21:13,176 --> 00:21:14,271
Oh, you're embarrassed?

529
00:21:14,446 --> 00:21:16,714
You got my period
during cheerleader tryouts.

530
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,573
I can never show my face
at school again!

531
00:21:18,627 --> 00:21:20,571
Do you think this is easy
for me?

532
00:21:20,607 --> 00:21:22,743
Do you think I like having
to sit while I pee?!

533
00:21:22,797 --> 00:21:25,325
Do you think I like having
to make out with mommy?!

534
00:21:26,631 --> 00:21:28,821
(sighs) Oh, my God.

535
00:21:28,941 --> 00:21:31,624
Cut! This is a disaster!
(buzzer)

536
00:21:31,678 --> 00:21:32,520
(crew speaking indistinctly)
what?

537
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,247
Well, I-I thought that was
working pretty well.

538
00:21:34,283 --> 00:21:35,426
How... how'd that feel
for you?

539
00:21:35,468 --> 00:21:36,882
Ohh. This is a train wreck.

540
00:21:38,952 --> 00:21:40,704
I-I thought that was some
of my best work ever.

541
00:21:40,734 --> 00:21:41,281
I mean...

542
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,074
Hey, whoa, whoa. I'm still
working on that, a-actually.

543
