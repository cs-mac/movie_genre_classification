1
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:02,563
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's more
than an entertainment. It's a panacea.

2
00:02:02,563 --> 00:02:05,106
Well, a tonic.
That's it, ladies and gents.

3
00:02:05,106 --> 00:02:08,507
A tonic for jangled nerves
and tired blood.

4
00:02:08,507 --> 00:02:11,774
There's nothing like a good fright
for toning up the circulation.

5
00:02:11,774 --> 00:02:14,976
That's what you've got in here.
Yes, ladies and gents, it's in here.

6
00:02:14,976 --> 00:02:18,020
You'll shriek, you'll shudder,
you'll shiver...

7
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,123
...but it's all in fun
and no harm done.

8
00:02:20,123 --> 00:02:22,759
So come along, ladies and gents,
get your tickets now.

9
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:25,122
Only half a crown. Half a crown...

10
00:02:25,122 --> 00:02:29,027
...for the greatest thrill
you've ever had in your life.

11
00:02:40,778 --> 00:02:44,805
Come along to
the Torture Garden of Dr. Diabolo.

12
00:02:44,805 --> 00:02:49,750
Dr. Diabolo's Torture Garden.

13
00:03:21,085 --> 00:03:24,179
Yes, my friends. There is no end...

14
00:03:24,179 --> 00:03:27,256
...to man's inhumanity to man.

15
00:03:27,256 --> 00:03:28,915
You have seen torture.

16
00:03:29,661 --> 00:03:33,358
Now I'm gonna show you death.

17
00:03:40,972 --> 00:03:43,270
The electric chair.

18
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:45,268
It's used...

19
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:51,448
...for the execution of condemned
criminals in the United States.

20
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:56,546
The man in that chair has
committed a crime. It's murder.

21
00:03:56,754 --> 00:03:58,153
He's gonna pay for it.

22
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,158
Strapped and helpless
in that little chair...

23
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:04,219
...the creature awaits his doom.

24
00:04:05,363 --> 00:04:09,163
Perhaps you feel sympathy,
compassion for him, eh?

25
00:04:09,163 --> 00:04:11,302
Well, not me.

26
00:04:11,603 --> 00:04:13,434
Not me...

27
00:04:13,434 --> 00:04:15,937
...for reasons of my own.

28
00:04:16,808 --> 00:04:20,574
And soon, thousands of volts
of electricity...

29
00:04:20,574 --> 00:04:22,872
...will sear every nerve...

30
00:04:22,872 --> 00:04:25,743
...and every cell of his body.

31
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:29,377
A very civilized method of revenge...

32
00:04:29,377 --> 00:04:31,545
...that I approve of.

33
00:04:31,823 --> 00:04:34,451
You'll notice the bits of sponge
here and there...

34
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:37,254
...where the electrodes
touch the flesh.

35
00:04:37,254 --> 00:04:39,589
That is to prevent the gentleman...

36
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:43,700
...from being burnt to a cinder
before your eyes. But nevertheless...

37
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,166
...he will burn inside.

38
00:04:46,671 --> 00:04:48,002
Inside.

39
00:04:48,573 --> 00:04:50,438
Inside.

40
00:04:50,908 --> 00:04:52,899
Inside.

41
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:57,041
You picture yourself in his place.

42
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:59,649
Yes, try that.

43
00:05:00,451 --> 00:05:03,477
Now, in his final moment...

44
00:05:05,123 --> 00:05:07,284
...his last breath...

45
00:05:07,284 --> 00:05:11,189
...his last sweet second of life.

46
00:05:11,996 --> 00:05:13,429
And now, my friend...

47
00:05:13,429 --> 00:05:16,999
...in full payment
for what has passed...

48
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:19,398
...I am going to pull the switch.

49
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:53,931
And that, ladies and gentlemen,
concludes our regular performance.

50
00:05:56,107 --> 00:05:57,665
But wait.

51
00:05:58,042 --> 00:05:59,942
There's more to come.

52
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,408
Oh, yes.

53
00:06:01,408 --> 00:06:04,070
What you have seen...

54
00:06:06,584 --> 00:06:09,348
...are imaginary horrors.

55
00:06:11,055 --> 00:06:12,682
But now...

56
00:06:12,682 --> 00:06:15,951
...I can let you experience
real ones.

57
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:20,757
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
I do have a private exhibit.

58
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:24,796
It is for the true connoisseurs.

59
00:06:24,796 --> 00:06:28,905
Yes, right behind the curtain there
you will find...

60
00:06:29,207 --> 00:06:31,402
...the real Torture Garden.

61
00:06:31,402 --> 00:06:34,568
It is not for the faint of heart.

62
00:06:34,568 --> 00:06:38,307
For what you find there will be
more terrifying, more horrendous...

63
00:06:38,307 --> 00:06:40,417
...than your deepest,
darkest dreams.

64
00:06:40,417 --> 00:06:42,951
Now, then,
who has the courage to try it?

65
00:06:46,057 --> 00:06:48,787
- How much does it cost?
- Well, since this exhibit...

66
00:06:48,787 --> 00:06:52,020
...is limited to a special few, £5.

67
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,723
- Five pounds? You got a nerve.
- And what about you?

68
00:06:55,723 --> 00:07:00,234
Have you the nerve to face the thing
that lies waiting inside there, eh?

69
00:07:00,234 --> 00:07:02,430
It's a thrill of a lifetime,
I guarantee it.

70
00:07:02,774 --> 00:07:06,574
If you don't agree with me afterwards,
I'll cheerfully refund your money.

71
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:09,241
Well, come on.
Are you all cowards?

72
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,105
It is a lot of money...

73
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,384
...but I'd like to see.

74
00:07:15,086 --> 00:07:16,883
What about you, mate?

75
00:07:17,088 --> 00:07:19,113
I think he's a fake.

76
00:07:20,057 --> 00:07:21,957
Still, let's have a go.

77
00:07:27,398 --> 00:07:28,888
One moment.

78
00:07:28,888 --> 00:07:33,503
There are others here who may find
this exhibit of special interest.

79
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:34,999
These two ladies.

80
00:07:38,776 --> 00:07:41,006
Come on, I dare you.

81
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:49,186
Yes, thank you. Now step
right inside, if you don't mind.

82
00:07:49,186 --> 00:07:53,312
Don't be afraid.
I'll join you in a moment.

83
00:07:56,527 --> 00:07:58,358
Is this all there is?

84
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:02,662
- It's not much to look at, is it?
- Not for a fiver, it isn't.

85
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:05,666
- You're American, aren't you?
- Yes.

86
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,395
- Where you from?
- Hollywood.

87
00:08:07,395 --> 00:08:09,938
- You in films?
- Yes, my cousin's visiting me...

88
00:08:09,938 --> 00:08:13,508
...on holiday. I'm afraid
she must find it rather dull here.

89
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:16,442
Yes or no?

90
00:08:29,894 --> 00:08:31,589
Where is he?

91
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:08,755
Oh, it's just a waxworks.

92
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:11,230
A dummy?

93
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,633
- If you ask me, we're the dummies.
- It isn't quite what I expected.

94
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:17,933
- What did you expect?
- Well, I don't know, but...

95
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,800
Where is he, this...?
What's he call himself?

96
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,708
Diabolo. You call me?

97
00:09:24,348 --> 00:09:27,875
- Who's your friend?
- That's a good question.

98
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,418
This is a figure from ancient legend.

99
00:09:30,418 --> 00:09:33,250
Atropos, goddess of destiny.

100
00:09:33,457 --> 00:09:37,450
In the left hand, the skein of life.
In the right, the shears of fate.

101
00:09:37,728 --> 00:09:40,390
Each colored thread
represents a human life.

102
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:44,126
And the shears
have the power to cut it short.

103
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:45,860
Oh, come on.

104
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,063
It's just a mechanical figure
that tells your fortune for a penny.

105
00:09:49,373 --> 00:09:51,364
Yes, she can tell your fortune,
of course.

106
00:09:51,364 --> 00:09:53,510
That's the least of it. No, no, no.

107
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:58,513
See, I promised you horror.
And I intend to keep that promise.

108
00:09:58,513 --> 00:10:01,914
This sibyl here
has a very strange magic...

109
00:10:01,914 --> 00:10:05,886
...a very strange power.
For she is able to reveal...

110
00:10:05,886 --> 00:10:10,084
...to each and every one of you
the ultimate horror.

111
00:10:10,084 --> 00:10:12,252
Which is, of course...

112
00:10:12,252 --> 00:10:16,526
...the horror that you have
hidden away inside yourself.

113
00:10:16,526 --> 00:10:19,226
The secret, in fact...

114
00:10:19,226 --> 00:10:21,064
...of your own evil.

115
00:10:21,064 --> 00:10:24,730
A very old-fashioned word
nowadays, "evil. "

116
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,240
You'd prefer I say:

117
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,905
"The primordial monstrosities that
lurk beneath the surface of the mind. "

118
00:10:31,905 --> 00:10:34,517
But I prefer "evil. "

119
00:10:34,819 --> 00:10:36,116
Just a minute.

120
00:10:36,116 --> 00:10:39,814
- Is this all you've got to show us?
- No, there is this also:

121
00:10:39,814 --> 00:10:43,927
That if you can gain a knowledge
of your inner evil...

122
00:10:43,927 --> 00:10:48,464
...why, then you will have been
forewarned, and perhaps...

123
00:10:48,464 --> 00:10:50,430
...that is, perhaps...

124
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,092
...you can escape
the monstrous act...

125
00:10:53,092 --> 00:10:55,067
...and the hideous consequences.

126
00:10:55,306 --> 00:10:59,834
Are you trying to tell us that this
thing can really foretell the future?

127
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:02,775
I'm simply trying to say
that what she foretells...

128
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:05,347
...need not come to pass.

129
00:11:05,347 --> 00:11:07,916
Not if you heed what you've learned.

130
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:12,283
Not if you shun the evil
that lies deep in your nature.

131
00:11:12,283 --> 00:11:14,686
I didn't pay £5 to listen to you
preach a sermon.

132
00:11:14,686 --> 00:11:18,124
- I think you've lost your money, friend.
- Come here, young man.

133
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:20,825
Come here.

134
00:11:21,132 --> 00:11:22,895
What, are you afraid?

135
00:11:27,405 --> 00:11:29,965
You seem to doubt my word.

136
00:11:30,374 --> 00:11:33,172
How would you like
to be the first to learn...

137
00:11:33,172 --> 00:11:35,175
...what fate has in store for you?

138
00:11:35,513 --> 00:11:37,208
What do I do, ask it questions?

139
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:40,440
That won't be necessary.
Just stand where you are.

140
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:42,810
The figure will communicate
with you.

141
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,421
- How?
- Through your mind.

142
00:11:46,724 --> 00:11:50,319
Just look at the figure.
Look at the figure.

143
00:11:50,319 --> 00:11:54,396
It can't hurt you.
Now look at the shears.

144
00:11:54,765 --> 00:11:58,292
Look deeply. Deeply, deeply.

145
00:11:58,536 --> 00:12:01,903
Deeply, deeply...

146
00:12:01,903 --> 00:12:05,531
...into the shears of fate.

147
00:12:47,952 --> 00:12:50,978
- Hello, I'm Colin Williams.
- I'm Nurse Parker.

148
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,953
Yes, your uncle said
you might be coming for a visit.

149
00:12:53,953 --> 00:12:56,650
- How is he?
- His heart is very weak.

150
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,624
The doctor says it could be
any time now.

151
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:01,354
- I'll try not to tire him.
- Good.

152
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:03,260
I'll be off. If there's any change...

153
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,732
...get in touch with Dr. Silversmith
in the village.

154
00:13:05,732 --> 00:13:08,633
- Yes, I will. Thank you. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

155
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:14,375
Well, Colin, it's been a long time.

156
00:13:16,781 --> 00:13:20,740
- Yes. Three years, isn't it?
- It must be all of that.

157
00:13:21,352 --> 00:13:22,944
You're looking fit.

158
00:13:22,944 --> 00:13:26,920
- And you.
- My time on earth is short.

159
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:31,921
- Since you're my sole living relative-
- Yes, I realize that.

160
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:35,226
- Frankly, I'm very grateful.
- Are you, now?

161
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:38,031
Yeah. It just so happens that...

162
00:13:38,031 --> 00:13:40,329
...right now I'm in a bit
of a fix, financially.

163
00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:43,735
I didn't invite you here
to discuss money.

164
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:46,840
Sit down.

165
00:13:47,044 --> 00:13:48,841
- Here, let me-
- No.

166
00:13:49,046 --> 00:13:51,344
What I have to say...

167
00:13:51,982 --> 00:13:54,610
...is of far greater importance.

168
00:13:55,452 --> 00:13:59,479
This may be the last time
we shall ever meet.

169
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:04,594
Once and for all, I want to urge
you again to mend your ways.

170
00:14:04,862 --> 00:14:07,524
You can't expect
to go on like this forever.

171
00:14:07,524 --> 00:14:13,261
You must find a job, settle down,
make something of your life.

172
00:14:14,538 --> 00:14:19,066
If you could only understand this,
if you could see the light...

173
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:23,071
...that would be the greatest legacy
I could give you.

174
00:14:23,714 --> 00:14:25,682
You're absolutely right.

175
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:28,641
These last three years
haven't been easy.

176
00:14:28,986 --> 00:14:32,422
Believe me, I've learned my lesson.

177
00:14:33,257 --> 00:14:34,815
Good.

178
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,293
- You have a job?
- I've got one promised...

179
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,294
...as soon as I've cleared up
my obligations.

180
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,225
Oh, it's not all that bad,
it's just a matter...

181
00:14:45,225 --> 00:14:47,131
...of a few thousand pounds.

182
00:14:47,131 --> 00:14:49,772
Out of the question,
absolutely out of the question.

183
00:14:49,772 --> 00:14:51,771
- Uncle Roger.
- I don't have the money.

184
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:55,543
And what about your fortune?
My inheritance.

185
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:59,445
- There is no fortune.
- Rubbish!

186
00:15:00,217 --> 00:15:02,344
Everyone knows you've got money.

187
00:15:02,786 --> 00:15:04,879
You've lived here
on your own, what...

188
00:15:05,256 --> 00:15:06,883
...thirty years?

189
00:15:07,358 --> 00:15:09,223
You've never worked.

190
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,456
- How do you pay for it all?
- That's none of your business.

191
00:15:12,456 --> 00:15:15,224
That's where you're wrong.
It is my business.

192
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,164
I've been asking questions.

193
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:21,767
They say in the village that
everything you buy is paid for in cash.

194
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:24,407
No, no, not just ordinary cash.

195
00:15:24,407 --> 00:15:28,443
But coins. Old gold coins.

196
00:15:28,443 --> 00:15:31,638
Please, I don't want to talk about it.

197
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:33,305
All right.

198
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:35,677
We'll talk about something else.

199
00:15:37,655 --> 00:15:39,680
This cottage, for instance.

200
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,688
Very old, isn't it?

201
00:15:41,688 --> 00:15:44,259
They say in the village
it was deserted for years...

202
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:46,487
...before you moved in
and renovated it.

203
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,630
There's talk about it
belonging to a witch.

204
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:51,165
- Local gossip, superstition.
- Is it?

205
00:15:51,165 --> 00:15:53,963
Surely you don't believe
in witchcraft.

206
00:15:53,963 --> 00:15:58,404
This cottage was owned by
a harmless old woman, an eccentric.

207
00:15:58,404 --> 00:16:01,043
You mean a miser, don't you?

208
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:05,307
A miser with a hidden hoard of gold.
And you discovered it.

209
00:16:05,307 --> 00:16:07,507
- That's the truth!
- Stop.

210
00:16:07,507 --> 00:16:09,880
Can't you see
what you're doing to me?

211
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,147
- Let me alone.
- Not until you tell me...

212
00:16:12,147 --> 00:16:14,314
...where that money is hidden.

213
00:16:18,462 --> 00:16:21,989
Colin, my medicine.

214
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,964
There, on the mantelpiece.

215
00:16:24,964 --> 00:16:26,659
Quickly.

216
00:16:28,806 --> 00:16:30,398
Half a glass.

217
00:16:30,398 --> 00:16:32,064
Hurry.

218
00:16:51,362 --> 00:16:53,262
- The money.
- Please.

219
00:16:53,731 --> 00:16:55,164
I'll tell you later.

220
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:05,203
Now!

221
00:17:07,411 --> 00:17:09,242
Colin.

222
00:17:09,242 --> 00:17:11,244
Oh, God.

223
00:17:24,561 --> 00:17:26,085
Damn.

224
00:17:45,449 --> 00:17:49,579
I was handing him his medicine
when he had this final spasm.

225
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:52,916
They go like that sometimes.
One's seen it before.

226
00:17:53,891 --> 00:17:56,018
Seven o'clock, you said?

227
00:17:56,894 --> 00:17:59,055
What? Oh, about that.

228
00:17:59,055 --> 00:18:01,493
I really didn't check the exact time.

229
00:18:01,493 --> 00:18:05,624
Oh, 7 is near enough.
It's just a formality for the record.

230
00:18:05,936 --> 00:18:08,200
I'll complete this in the morning.

231
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,203
Oh, thank you, doctor.

232
00:18:10,203 --> 00:18:13,810
- You're stopping for the funeral?
- Certainly.

233
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:17,678
You don't mind spending the night
here alone?

234
00:18:17,678 --> 00:18:20,339
No. No, of course not.

235
00:18:23,787 --> 00:18:26,551
Well, look after yourself.

236
00:21:11,722 --> 00:21:13,314
Yes.

237
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:13,199
Yes.

238
00:23:13,577 --> 00:23:15,442
I can hear you.

239
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:20,711
Your name...

240
00:23:22,085 --> 00:23:24,918
...is Balthazar.

241
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,653
You've come to stay with me.

242
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:32,484
To serve me...

243
00:23:33,897 --> 00:23:36,525
...as you served my uncle.

244
00:23:39,536 --> 00:23:42,004
You will...

245
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:43,969
...reward me...

246
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:47,275
...as you rewarded him...

247
00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:51,447
...in return...

248
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:55,143
...for things I must do for you.

249
00:23:55,719 --> 00:23:57,550
My uncle...

250
00:23:58,555 --> 00:24:00,955
...was ungrateful.

251
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:05,557
He buried...

252
00:24:05,557 --> 00:24:09,358
...you away in the darkness.

253
00:24:09,358 --> 00:24:12,866
But now you are free...

254
00:24:15,572 --> 00:24:17,563
...and hungry.

255
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:23,941
Hungry.

256
00:25:41,825 --> 00:25:42,575
No.

257
00:25:46,096 --> 00:25:46,846
No!

258
00:26:18,562 --> 00:26:20,120
Dream.

259
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:41,705
You've come...

260
00:27:41,705 --> 00:27:43,573
...to stay with me...

261
00:27:43,573 --> 00:27:45,271
...serve me...

262
00:27:45,271 --> 00:27:47,177
...as you served my uncle.

263
00:27:47,177 --> 00:27:49,682
You will reward me...

264
00:27:49,682 --> 00:27:51,718
...as you rewarded him.

265
00:30:23,606 --> 00:30:24,356
No.

266
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:27,505
No, not her.

267
00:30:34,984 --> 00:30:38,613
All right, I'll do it. I'll do it.

268
00:31:20,063 --> 00:31:21,928
Mr. Williams.

269
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,329
Mr. Williams.

270
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:42,281
Mr. Williams. Mr. Williams.

271
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:47,415
There's... There's a man
out there with his head all...

272
00:31:52,228 --> 00:31:53,068
No! No!

273
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:32,567
Good evening, sir.

274
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:41,400
Not leaving us now, are you, sir?

275
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,272
I've got my living to earn, you know.

276
00:32:43,272 --> 00:32:46,779
I won't keep you. But I thought you
might be able to give me information.

277
00:32:47,116 --> 00:32:49,880
There's been some talk of a tramp
reported in this area.

278
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,920
Harmless old chap apparently,
but we're on the lookout for him.

279
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,023
You don't happen
to have seen him, have you?

280
00:32:55,023 --> 00:32:57,523
No. I've seen no one all day.

281
00:32:57,523 --> 00:33:00,060
Now, if you'll excuse me...

282
00:33:01,164 --> 00:33:03,530
Let me give you a hand with this, sir.

283
00:33:16,379 --> 00:33:18,609
Why did you do it, Colin?

284
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:24,846
What made you kill them?

285
00:33:25,455 --> 00:33:28,788
- Balthazar.
- Balthazar? Who is he?

286
00:33:30,193 --> 00:33:31,717
I don't know.

287
00:33:33,062 --> 00:33:35,622
He takes the form of a cat.

288
00:33:36,232 --> 00:33:39,463
But he's not a cat. He's inside me.

289
00:33:39,936 --> 00:33:43,133
He's in- He's inside my head.

290
00:33:43,133 --> 00:33:46,298
I see. He's inside your head.

291
00:33:46,298 --> 00:33:50,003
Oh, yeah. I know how it sounds.

292
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:52,308
But it's true.

293
00:33:53,716 --> 00:33:56,048
Balthazar is real.

294
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:58,685
How long has he been with you?

295
00:33:58,685 --> 00:34:00,846
Since last night...

296
00:34:01,491 --> 00:34:03,618
...when I found a skeleton
in the cellar.

297
00:34:03,618 --> 00:34:07,092
- In your uncle's house?
- The witch's house.

298
00:34:07,092 --> 00:34:11,165
Don't you see? Balthazar must
have been the witch's familiar spirit.

299
00:34:11,934 --> 00:34:16,064
He made my uncle rich
with the witch's gold.

300
00:34:16,939 --> 00:34:18,668
In return...

301
00:34:18,668 --> 00:34:20,672
...for murdering, huh?

302
00:34:20,672 --> 00:34:23,835
But my uncle tricked him.

303
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,072
He buried him away
in the darkness.

304
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:30,984
Balthazar said he was ungrateful.

305
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:33,747
Anyway...

306
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:35,719
...I freed him.

307
00:34:36,492 --> 00:34:38,084
And then he...

308
00:34:38,294 --> 00:34:42,253
He wanted to have
the same agreement with me.

309
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,997
Now, you don't know
what it's like, doctor...

310
00:34:45,997 --> 00:34:48,296
...to have a creature...

311
00:34:48,296 --> 00:34:50,496
...whispering inside your head...

312
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,735
...giving you commands.

313
00:34:53,076 --> 00:34:54,976
You've got to obey.

314
00:34:55,945 --> 00:34:58,470
You've got to obey or...

315
00:34:59,882 --> 00:35:01,474
Or he starts...

316
00:35:01,784 --> 00:35:05,515
...scratching and clawing inside.

317
00:35:06,923 --> 00:35:10,689
He forced me to kill the tramp
and Nurse Parker.

318
00:35:11,227 --> 00:35:13,252
We found the bodies in your trunk.

319
00:35:13,252 --> 00:35:16,159
But there's one more thing
you must tell us, Colin.

320
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:18,357
What happened to their heads?

321
00:35:18,568 --> 00:35:21,332
- Why did you-?
- Not me.

322
00:35:21,704 --> 00:35:23,695
Balthazar.

323
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,168
That's what he feeds on
when he's hungry.

324
00:35:28,311 --> 00:35:30,541
You mustn't let him
come back to me.

325
00:35:30,541 --> 00:35:32,772
- Please don't go.
- I'll be back in the morning.

326
00:35:32,772 --> 00:35:35,543
No, you can't leave me
here alone, not all night.

327
00:35:35,543 --> 00:35:38,380
Balthazar will be hungry again,
and if he isn't fed-

328
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,887
Don't you understand?
He'll be hungry.

329
00:35:41,887 --> 00:35:43,616
Come back!

330
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:46,954
Come back! Please.

331
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:50,194
Please don't leave me!

332
00:36:09,051 --> 00:36:10,746
Let me out!

333
00:36:10,746 --> 00:36:14,048
Get me away from him!
Get me away from him!

334
00:36:14,048 --> 00:36:17,283
Let me out! He's here! He's hungry!

335
00:36:17,283 --> 00:36:20,088
- Now, what's your problem?
- Look.

336
00:36:22,331 --> 00:36:26,427
There's nothing there. Now you
calm down and get some sleep.

337
00:36:26,427 --> 00:36:28,467
No, don't go away.

338
00:36:28,467 --> 00:36:31,300
He'll come back for me!

339
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,374
He'll come back!

340
00:36:33,374 --> 00:36:37,240
Don't let it get at me! Help!

341
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:22,285
Are you all right?

342
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:25,058
You seemed to be in a trance.

343
00:37:25,058 --> 00:37:28,459
Just standing there
and staring into space for a minute.

344
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:31,794
Only a minute?

345
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:34,992
It seemed like days.

346
00:37:37,073 --> 00:37:38,597
I can't explain.

347
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:40,468
I can.

348
00:37:41,143 --> 00:37:42,371
There is a theory:

349
00:37:42,371 --> 00:37:46,504
The past, the present and the future
are merely different aspects...

350
00:37:46,504 --> 00:37:48,843
...of the same moment
in time and space.

351
00:37:49,852 --> 00:37:51,513
Do you understand that theory?

352
00:37:51,988 --> 00:37:55,151
Then perhaps you can understand
that since a drowning man...

353
00:37:55,151 --> 00:37:58,782
...can view his entire past
in a few seconds...

354
00:37:58,782 --> 00:38:01,293
...he can also view his future...

355
00:38:01,293 --> 00:38:03,557
...by the same rule.

356
00:38:03,766 --> 00:38:06,132
Particularly if he's hypnotized?

357
00:38:06,132 --> 00:38:09,237
That's all it was. Hypnosis.
It's a trick.

358
00:38:09,237 --> 00:38:11,100
- No trick.
- What then?

359
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,639
A warning.

360
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:15,936
What exactly did you see?

361
00:38:17,346 --> 00:38:19,109
- I'd rather not talk about it.
- Well...

362
00:38:19,315 --> 00:38:21,840
...was there anything about it
that was true?

363
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:27,283
It's true I have an uncle
who lives in the country.

364
00:38:27,556 --> 00:38:31,287
And I was going to see him to ask...

365
00:38:33,195 --> 00:38:35,288
- But how did you know?
- I never saw you before.

366
00:38:35,288 --> 00:38:38,024
I know nothing about you.
You are merely a customer.

367
00:38:38,267 --> 00:38:40,064
Who comes next?

368
00:38:40,636 --> 00:38:44,470
Who is the next to meet Atropos,
the goddess of destiny?

369
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,699
What about you, young lady?

370
00:38:47,476 --> 00:38:49,671
Surely an innocent young woman
like yourself...

371
00:38:49,671 --> 00:38:53,076
...has no deep, dark secrets
in her mind.

372
00:38:54,717 --> 00:38:58,813
Why don't you? After all,
it was your idea to come in here.

373
00:39:07,229 --> 00:39:11,290
It will show you nothing
but what is in your own heart.

374
00:39:11,967 --> 00:39:13,594
Now...

375
00:39:15,004 --> 00:39:16,995
...look at the shears.

376
00:39:16,995 --> 00:39:18,640
Look closely at the shears.

377
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,368
Your eyes are fixed on the shears,
they can't look away.

378
00:39:21,811 --> 00:39:24,780
Look deeply, deeply.

379
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:28,383
Deeply into the shears of fate.

380
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:43,330
- What time is it?
- Seven-twenty.

381
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:47,196
Oh, no. He'll be here in 10 minutes.
I'll never get this done in time.

382
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,970
So let him wait a while.

383
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,039
- Who is it?
- Mike Charles.

384
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:55,105
And he's not the kind
you keep waiting.

385
00:39:55,105 --> 00:39:56,938
This dinner date
could be important.

386
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,945
You know what it can mean.

387
00:39:58,945 --> 00:40:02,107
Going to the right places,
meeting the right people.

388
00:40:02,107 --> 00:40:05,776
I know. It's the only way
for a girl to get ahead in this town.

389
00:40:06,622 --> 00:40:11,025
Look at these wrinkles. And I haven't
even had my shower yet!

390
00:40:12,428 --> 00:40:14,623
Go on, go take your shower.
Let me iron the dress.

391
00:40:14,623 --> 00:40:18,062
Oh, would you?
Carla, gee, thanks. You're an angel.

392
00:40:18,267 --> 00:40:20,758
What are roommates for?

393
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,987
- Finished?
- Oh, Millie, it's that darned material.

394
00:41:13,987 --> 00:41:16,215
The iron was too hot.

395
00:41:16,215 --> 00:41:18,383
- Oh, no!
- I'm sorry, Millie.

396
00:41:18,383 --> 00:41:20,620
- No!
- You can wear something else maybe.

397
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,730
You know I haven't got
any wardrobe.

398
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:26,095
I went without lunches
a whole month to buy this dress.

399
00:41:26,095 --> 00:41:29,032
I'd let you have one of mine,
only I've only got one good one.

400
00:41:29,032 --> 00:41:30,832
And I'm wearing that tonight.

401
00:41:30,832 --> 00:41:33,907
Oh, no, he's here.
Oh, Carla, please do something.

402
00:41:33,907 --> 00:41:38,240
- Make some excuse.
- Listen, don't worry. I'll handle it.

403
00:41:42,618 --> 00:41:45,246
Hello. I'm Mike Charles.

404
00:41:45,855 --> 00:41:48,449
Hello, I'm Carla Hayes,
Millie's roommate.

405
00:41:48,449 --> 00:41:51,923
- Won't you come in?
- Thanks.

406
00:41:55,664 --> 00:41:58,155
- Millie almost ready?
- Millie can't go out tonight.

407
00:41:58,155 --> 00:41:59,892
She's in bed with the flu.

408
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:03,197
- Well, can I just say hello?
- I don't think you should.

409
00:42:03,197 --> 00:42:04,999
That flu's kind of catching.

410
00:42:04,999 --> 00:42:07,665
Yeah, yeah, maybe
I better not go in there.

411
00:42:12,381 --> 00:42:16,545
- Gee, I'm sorry your evening's ruined.
- Yeah, it is kind of rough.

412
00:42:16,545 --> 00:42:18,482
Could have been
a real swinging scene.

413
00:42:18,482 --> 00:42:21,851
- Table for two at Danny's.
- Danny's?

414
00:42:33,936 --> 00:42:38,100
- Like it?
- Love it. All these people.

415
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,034
- Isn't that Bruce Benton over there?
- Where?

416
00:42:41,034 --> 00:42:44,737
- At the table in the corner.
- Yeah, and Eddie Storm.

417
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:48,149
- He's a producer, isn't he?
- The biggest.

418
00:42:48,551 --> 00:42:51,850
Oh, no. Mike Charles, of all people.

419
00:42:52,054 --> 00:42:55,490
With any luck, he'll be too interested
in his new friend to notice us.

420
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,683
Come on, let's say hello.

421
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:04,629
- Eddie! How's it going?
- Why, Mike.

422
00:43:04,629 --> 00:43:08,668
- Bruce. Mike Charles, remember?
- Yes. Yes, of course.

423
00:43:08,668 --> 00:43:12,273
Oh, Carla Hayes, Eddie Storm.
I guess you know who this is.

424
00:43:12,273 --> 00:43:14,841
- Won't you join us?
- Really, we don't want to intrude.

425
00:43:14,841 --> 00:43:16,238
Oh, go ahead and sit down.

426
00:43:16,238 --> 00:43:18,380
Eddie and I got some business
to talk over.

427
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:21,539
You go ahead and order.
I'm buying Eddie a little drink.

428
00:43:26,221 --> 00:43:30,715
I can't believe it. Imagine me
having dinner with Bruce Benton.

429
00:43:30,715 --> 00:43:33,555
You know, I've had a thing about you
ever since I was...

430
00:43:33,555 --> 00:43:37,893
Ever since you were a little girl.
Go ahead and say it. I don't mind.

431
00:43:37,893 --> 00:43:40,661
- It just doesn't seem possible.
- What?

432
00:43:40,661 --> 00:43:42,326
Your having dinner with me?

433
00:43:42,326 --> 00:43:44,699
Or because I've been around
so long?

434
00:43:44,699 --> 00:43:47,034
Now you're embarrassing me.

435
00:43:47,409 --> 00:43:50,173
You'll feel better
after you've had a drink.

436
00:43:55,351 --> 00:43:58,809
What's with you? I've been trying to
get you on the phone for two weeks.

437
00:43:58,809 --> 00:44:01,081
I'm lining up production
on his new picture.

438
00:44:01,081 --> 00:44:03,554
- You know how these things are.
- Don't give me that.

439
00:44:03,554 --> 00:44:05,853
You've been freezing me.
I've knocked around...

440
00:44:05,853 --> 00:44:09,555
...this industry for 25 years. I figure
I'm entitled to a little consideration.

441
00:44:09,555 --> 00:44:11,632
I realize that.

442
00:44:11,632 --> 00:44:13,893
You know how important
this business is to me.

443
00:44:13,893 --> 00:44:17,402
- When do I get the word?
- Now, if you like.

444
00:44:17,402 --> 00:44:20,804
Great. Eddie, baby,
I knew you wouldn't let me down.

445
00:44:20,804 --> 00:44:23,467
You talked to them?
Well, what did they say?

446
00:44:23,467 --> 00:44:26,012
- Nothing doing.
- What do you mean, nothing doing?

447
00:44:26,012 --> 00:44:29,309
You know the pictures I've made.
I've got a right to belong.

448
00:44:29,309 --> 00:44:32,477
- You were voted down.
- But I'd do anything, really I would.

449
00:44:32,477 --> 00:44:35,624
- Talk to them again.
- I'm sorry, you know the rules.

450
00:44:35,624 --> 00:44:38,692
Don't take it so hard.
Have another drink.

451
00:44:38,692 --> 00:44:40,590
- Where you going?
- Don't worry about me.

452
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:44,028
I'll have another drink, lots of drinks.
You tell your friends from me...

453
00:44:44,028 --> 00:44:47,100
...not to worry about Mike Charles.
He can take care of himself.

454
00:44:47,403 --> 00:44:48,927
But maybe they ought to worry...

455
00:44:48,927 --> 00:44:52,301
...because Mike Charles
is just liable to take care of them.

456
00:45:08,557 --> 00:45:12,653
That's wonderful.
Would you really do that for me?

457
00:45:12,653 --> 00:45:16,093
Anybody who knows the titles of all
the pictures I've made since 1950...

458
00:45:16,093 --> 00:45:17,698
...deserves a break.

459
00:45:17,698 --> 00:45:19,800
Sorry to keep you waiting.

460
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,368
- Where's Mr. Charles?
- He asked to be excused.

461
00:45:22,368 --> 00:45:24,802
Another engagement.
I hope you don't mind.

462
00:45:24,802 --> 00:45:26,634
That's quite all right.

463
00:45:26,634 --> 00:45:29,903
Bruce and I were just having
a very interesting discussion.

464
00:45:29,903 --> 00:45:33,207
I was suggesting to Miss Hayes that
she come to the studio Monday...

465
00:45:33,207 --> 00:45:35,748
...and make a test for that part
we have open.

466
00:45:36,485 --> 00:45:38,350
You mean the sister?

467
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:40,283
What do you think?

468
00:45:41,023 --> 00:45:44,186
Well, I don't know.
It's the second lead.

469
00:45:44,186 --> 00:45:47,726
- What have you done?
- Television, mostly.

470
00:45:47,726 --> 00:45:51,525
Bruce was just telling me
about the part. It sounds fascinating.

471
00:45:51,525 --> 00:45:52,928
I'm sure I could handle it.

472
00:45:53,168 --> 00:45:55,636
Why don't we shoot some film
and see?

473
00:45:57,072 --> 00:45:59,438
All right, let's do that.

474
00:45:59,438 --> 00:46:03,271
Finks, the whole lot of them. Finks.

475
00:46:05,147 --> 00:46:08,674
You better believe me.
Finks, that's what they are.

476
00:46:08,674 --> 00:46:12,582
- Them and their "top ten. "
- What top ten?

477
00:46:12,582 --> 00:46:14,313
Stars.

478
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:16,082
Directors.

479
00:46:16,082 --> 00:46:19,125
Producers. The big ones.

480
00:46:19,125 --> 00:46:23,162
The ones who stay on top
year after year after year.

481
00:46:23,162 --> 00:46:26,768
Who never seem to grow old.
Never slow down.

482
00:46:27,536 --> 00:46:31,529
Brother, I could tell you
something about that top ten.

483
00:46:31,529 --> 00:46:34,574
And don't think I won't tell it
in the right places.

484
00:46:34,574 --> 00:46:37,769
I've had it. Up to here.

485
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,313
Eddie Storm and all the rest of them.

486
00:46:41,313 --> 00:46:44,919
- Eddie Storm, the producer?
- Producer.

487
00:46:45,287 --> 00:46:46,652
Listen.

488
00:46:46,889 --> 00:46:50,290
If you only knew the real story
behind that character...

489
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:52,359
I could tell it.

490
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:55,390
Here.

491
00:46:56,765 --> 00:46:58,426
On the house.

492
00:46:58,934 --> 00:47:02,461
You make yourself at home.
I gotta go out back for a minute.

493
00:47:16,084 --> 00:47:17,949
You're not eating.

494
00:47:18,821 --> 00:47:21,790
I start filming next week, remember?

495
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:25,017
Now you know how I keep
my boyish figure.

496
00:47:25,761 --> 00:47:28,958
- And you?
- I'm on a diet.

497
00:47:34,036 --> 00:47:37,164
Excuse me, Mr. Storm.
There's a call for you.

498
00:47:37,906 --> 00:47:39,601
I'll take it over there.

499
00:47:39,601 --> 00:47:42,073
- Will you excuse me?
- Yes.

500
00:47:51,253 --> 00:47:53,312
Boy, I never thought
when I went out tonight...

501
00:47:53,312 --> 00:47:55,285
...that all this would be happening.

502
00:47:56,458 --> 00:47:59,518
Meeting you, get a chance
to be in a film with you.

503
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:04,089
I thought you'd wanna know.

504
00:48:04,933 --> 00:48:06,161
Sure.

505
00:48:06,161 --> 00:48:08,326
Sure, I understand.

506
00:48:08,326 --> 00:48:11,472
Don't worry. I'll handle it.

507
00:48:26,388 --> 00:48:28,982
Nothing important.
It's just a little problem.

508
00:48:29,391 --> 00:48:31,757
It's all been taken care of.

509
00:48:39,601 --> 00:48:42,900
- Where are we?
- Home. In your own garage.

510
00:48:44,039 --> 00:48:46,439
Oh, you're a real pal. Thanks.

511
00:48:46,439 --> 00:48:48,132
Hey!

512
00:49:30,852 --> 00:49:33,047
Carla, did you see this?

513
00:49:33,047 --> 00:49:35,689
Mike Charles is dead.

514
00:49:36,358 --> 00:49:40,294
He was overcome by exhaust fumes
in his garage.

515
00:49:40,294 --> 00:49:42,396
It happened last night.

516
00:49:43,398 --> 00:49:46,993
- Didn't he take you home?
- No.

517
00:49:48,603 --> 00:49:51,094
He left the restaurant
almost as soon as we got there.

518
00:49:51,094 --> 00:49:54,674
The paper says it was an accident.
He'd been drinking.

519
00:49:54,977 --> 00:49:57,445
How could he take you
to an expensive restaurant...

520
00:49:57,445 --> 00:50:01,139
- ... and then just walk out?
- Look, Millie, I hardly knew the man.

521
00:50:01,139 --> 00:50:03,011
He was your date.

522
00:50:03,011 --> 00:50:05,585
Let's talk about something
more pleasant.

523
00:50:05,887 --> 00:50:07,912
Hey, I made a good contact
last night.

524
00:50:07,912 --> 00:50:11,582
Eddie Storm's testing me on Monday
for a part in a new Bruce Benton film.

525
00:50:11,582 --> 00:50:13,625
A good part.

526
00:50:14,463 --> 00:50:16,124
Look, I know it sounds
cold-blooded...

527
00:50:16,124 --> 00:50:18,926
...but if a girl wants
to get ahead in this town...

528
00:50:18,926 --> 00:50:21,763
...she's gotta take her chances
when she gets them.

529
00:50:21,763 --> 00:50:25,395
And not worry about what happens
to anybody else.

530
00:50:25,395 --> 00:50:27,599
I wouldn't want to get there
that way.

531
00:50:28,543 --> 00:50:33,071
Millie, dear, I'm going to get there...

532
00:50:33,682 --> 00:50:35,582
...any way.

533
00:50:40,756 --> 00:50:42,280
Another day, another dollar.

534
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,119
- Tomorrow's call, Mr. Benton.
- Thanks, Fred.

535
00:50:45,761 --> 00:50:47,353
Well...

536
00:50:47,562 --> 00:50:50,690
...I see they've written
an extra scene for you.

537
00:50:51,366 --> 00:50:54,733
- You looked great in the shots today.
- I'd never have been in those shots...

538
00:50:54,733 --> 00:50:56,598
...if it wasn't for you.

539
00:51:00,876 --> 00:51:04,505
I got you something to show you
how much I appreciate it.

540
00:51:13,455 --> 00:51:17,585
- You can't afford a present like this.
- But I want you to have it.

541
00:51:17,585 --> 00:51:19,056
Put it on, okay?

542
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:23,022
Thanks.

543
00:51:27,169 --> 00:51:29,535
It was quite a day today.

544
00:51:32,407 --> 00:51:36,207
I'm really beat.
Where do you get all your energy?

545
00:51:37,212 --> 00:51:38,440
Clean living.

546
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,444
It certainly doesn't come
from overeating.

547
00:51:40,444 --> 00:51:43,311
You didn't even touch
your lunch this noon.

548
00:51:43,311 --> 00:51:45,680
- I'll make up for it tonight.
- Where are we going?

549
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,930
Not "we. " Me.

550
00:52:01,903 --> 00:52:05,566
I thought you said something
about going out tonight.

551
00:52:06,608 --> 00:52:11,739
I'm sorry about the hang-up.
Not tonight. Tomorrow night.

552
00:52:12,047 --> 00:52:16,108
Well, what kind of hang-up is it,
blond or brunette?

553
00:52:22,858 --> 00:52:24,723
Two brunets.

554
00:52:28,396 --> 00:52:29,727
Your agents?

555
00:52:32,267 --> 00:52:33,859
In a way.

556
00:52:34,903 --> 00:52:38,100
I'll see you in the morning.
Good night.

557
00:53:05,634 --> 00:53:08,728
- Where's Bruce?
- You just missed him.

558
00:53:08,728 --> 00:53:10,462
But you didn't?

559
00:53:11,406 --> 00:53:14,341
Bruce and I were rehearsing
our lines for tomorrow.

560
00:53:14,843 --> 00:53:17,038
- That's all right, isn't it?
- Of course.

561
00:53:17,038 --> 00:53:18,736
Rehearsals never hurt anybody.

562
00:53:18,736 --> 00:53:21,610
That's why I have them every day.
On the set.

563
00:53:22,951 --> 00:53:25,613
What's the matter, you have
some reason for disliking me?

564
00:53:26,555 --> 00:53:28,750
I didn't say that. You I like.

565
00:53:29,124 --> 00:53:31,615
You and Bruce Benton together,
that's a bad scene.

566
00:53:31,615 --> 00:53:35,092
Take my advice and lay off.
He's not for you.

567
00:53:44,873 --> 00:53:46,932
There he is now. Bruce!

568
00:53:47,375 --> 00:53:49,741
Bruce! Wait!

569
00:53:51,079 --> 00:53:52,478
Where did he say he was going?

570
00:53:52,478 --> 00:53:54,512
He just said he had
a business appointment.

571
00:53:54,512 --> 00:53:57,447
Business appointment?
With two of the worst hoods in town?

572
00:54:09,497 --> 00:54:11,328
Don't panic. He's all right.

573
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:22,738
Leo, help me get him
up to the car. Hurry!

574
00:54:24,412 --> 00:54:27,347
- Where you taking him?
- The sanatorium.

575
00:54:27,816 --> 00:54:29,681
Sunset Crest Sanatorium.

576
00:54:36,024 --> 00:54:38,925
- What happened?
- The operation's over.

577
00:54:39,227 --> 00:54:41,127
Dr. Heim says he'll be all right.

578
00:54:41,496 --> 00:54:42,724
That's impossible.

579
00:54:43,064 --> 00:54:45,726
Oh, no. It's true.

580
00:54:46,001 --> 00:54:47,298
Dr. Heim.

581
00:54:47,502 --> 00:54:51,165
My dear young lady, let me assure
you, there is no cause for alarm.

582
00:54:52,274 --> 00:54:55,141
- Only for silence.
- He's right.

583
00:54:55,443 --> 00:54:57,775
We can't have any publicity.
Bad for the picture.

584
00:54:58,446 --> 00:55:00,676
How can there be a picture
with Bruce-?

585
00:55:00,676 --> 00:55:04,114
The bullet has been removed.
He's resting comfortably.

586
00:55:04,586 --> 00:55:07,646
But I saw him. He was dead.

587
00:55:09,624 --> 00:55:12,092
- He's alive.
- Dr. Heim's a great surgeon.

588
00:55:12,294 --> 00:55:13,727
He has his own techniques.

589
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:16,659
Believe me, dear lady,
your friend is quite safe.

590
00:55:17,198 --> 00:55:19,666
- When can I see him?
- Monday.

591
00:55:20,001 --> 00:55:22,026
He will be back on the set Monday.

592
00:55:37,719 --> 00:55:39,380
Cut it!

593
00:55:40,488 --> 00:55:42,388
Great, Bruce, great. Okay, boys.

594
00:55:49,798 --> 00:55:51,698
Something wrong?

595
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55,936
- I can't believe it.
- Dr. Heim told you he'd be here.

596
00:55:56,838 --> 00:55:58,772
Looks good, doesn't he?

597
00:56:00,375 --> 00:56:03,139
- I've gotta talk to you.
- Want you in five minutes, Carla.

598
00:56:03,445 --> 00:56:05,777
Let's go inside.

599
00:56:06,414 --> 00:56:10,578
Okay, now take it in a fraction.
Right, that's it.

600
00:56:11,753 --> 00:56:14,745
Somebody fix that backing there.

601
00:56:15,757 --> 00:56:17,952
When are you going
to tell me the truth?

602
00:56:18,426 --> 00:56:22,362
All right. You would find out
sooner or later anyway.

603
00:56:22,831 --> 00:56:26,733
The man we saw in the car
the other night was Bruce's double.

604
00:56:26,733 --> 00:56:29,529
His double?
Look, I know his stand-in.

605
00:56:29,804 --> 00:56:31,066
I said, double.

606
00:56:31,272 --> 00:56:33,069
Let's face it, Bruce is getting along.

607
00:56:33,069 --> 00:56:35,402
He needs somebody
to share the load.

608
00:56:35,643 --> 00:56:37,201
After all, how do you imagine...

609
00:56:37,201 --> 00:56:40,507
...he's kept going as a top star
for over 30 years?

610
00:56:40,982 --> 00:56:42,779
Now you know the secret.

611
00:56:43,151 --> 00:56:45,745
But you still haven't told me
what happened.

612
00:56:46,554 --> 00:56:49,785
Just what you saw.
Bruce's double owed gambling debts.

613
00:56:50,158 --> 00:56:52,786
He was taken for a ride and killed.

614
00:56:53,128 --> 00:56:55,119
Then Dr. Heim didn't operate.

615
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:58,754
No. He merely disposed of the body.

616
00:57:00,034 --> 00:57:01,763
Who is Dr. Heim?

617
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:04,161
No more secrets.
You know too much already.

618
00:57:05,006 --> 00:57:07,372
Perhaps I know more than you think.

619
00:57:07,709 --> 00:57:09,506
What are you talking about?

620
00:57:09,506 --> 00:57:13,977
I did a little reading over the weekend.
At the newspaper office.

621
00:57:14,315 --> 00:57:18,547
Some old clippings.
They keep a file there, you know.

622
00:57:18,987 --> 00:57:20,716
It's called a morgue.

623
00:57:21,456 --> 00:57:25,119
- It's very appropriate, don't you think?
- What are you getting at?

624
00:57:25,493 --> 00:57:28,929
I thought I was getting at the truth
about Dr. Heim...

625
00:57:29,564 --> 00:57:31,532
...but instead I found out
something else.

626
00:57:32,367 --> 00:57:33,698
About you.

627
00:57:34,469 --> 00:57:36,437
On April 5th, 1944...

628
00:57:36,437 --> 00:57:39,698
...there was a speedboat accident
in the harbor off Newport Beach.

629
00:57:40,108 --> 00:57:41,837
You were thrown from the boat.

630
00:57:41,837 --> 00:57:44,808
When they took you to the hospital,
they thought you were dying.

631
00:57:44,808 --> 00:57:46,241
According to the story...

632
00:57:46,241 --> 00:57:49,542
...you were rushed from that hospital
to a private clinic:

633
00:57:49,542 --> 00:57:52,015
Sunset Crest Sanatorium.

634
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:56,151
The man who operated on you
there was a refugee physician.

635
00:57:56,791 --> 00:57:58,019
A Dr. Heim.

636
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:00,059
Two minutes, Miss Hayes.

637
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:02,719
Yes, it's true. He saved me.

638
00:58:02,997 --> 00:58:06,797
- A wonderful plastic surgeon.
- He must have been.

639
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:12,499
According to that newspaper story,
your entire skull and chest...

640
00:58:12,499 --> 00:58:15,142
...had been crushed beyond repair.

641
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,973
I don't see any scars, Mr. Storm.

642
00:58:21,216 --> 00:58:23,184
- I've had enough of this.
- Well, I haven't.

643
00:58:23,184 --> 00:58:26,912
I'm gonna see Bruce tonight,
and he'll tell me the truth.

644
00:58:39,534 --> 00:58:42,094
- Have you seen Mr. Benton?
- I haven't seen him leave yet.

645
00:58:42,094 --> 00:58:43,635
Thank you.

646
00:59:14,035 --> 00:59:15,730
Main gate?

647
00:59:16,271 --> 00:59:20,731
As soon as Dr. Heim gets here,
send him to Stage G.

648
00:59:23,077 --> 00:59:25,045
It doesn't concern you.

649
00:59:25,346 --> 00:59:27,712
Don't you see?
I have to know the truth.

650
00:59:27,916 --> 00:59:30,749
- There's nothing to tell you.
- Oh, yes, there is.

651
00:59:31,152 --> 00:59:32,483
Carla, please.

652
00:59:35,757 --> 00:59:38,351
You were the one who was shot.

653
00:59:38,726 --> 00:59:41,160
You were the one that we took
to the sanatorium.

654
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,263
Get out. I'm not gonna talk
about it.

655
00:59:43,665 --> 00:59:45,690
But you've gotta talk about it.

656
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:47,858
Bruce, don't you understand?

657
00:59:47,858 --> 00:59:50,869
- I'm in love with you.
- No, you can't be in love with me.

658
00:59:50,869 --> 00:59:53,735
Bruce, what happened?
What is it about Dr. Heim?

659
01:00:11,159 --> 01:00:13,184
It's metal.

660
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,492
All right.

661
01:00:20,969 --> 01:00:23,369
Look at it. Take a good look.

662
01:00:23,638 --> 01:00:25,765
You wanted to know
the secret of the top ten.

663
01:00:25,765 --> 01:00:28,636
The box-office stars who seem
to go on forever and ever.

664
01:00:29,243 --> 01:00:33,737
The ones who never age.
The immortals of the screen.

665
01:00:34,115 --> 01:00:37,312
Well, now you know the secret.
They are immortal.

666
01:00:37,919 --> 01:00:41,013
- It's Dr. Heim.
- Yes. Dr. Heim.

667
01:00:41,756 --> 01:00:45,590
He found a way of preserving
the brain and its abilities...

668
01:00:45,893 --> 01:00:47,986
...in a synthetic body.

669
01:00:48,262 --> 01:00:51,356
He did that to you and Eddie Storm?

670
01:00:52,033 --> 01:00:56,333
Yes. There are a few of us,
but only a few.

671
01:00:56,804 --> 01:00:58,738
And you don't have
to have an accident.

672
01:00:59,207 --> 01:01:01,698
But you must be
a very special person...

673
01:01:01,698 --> 01:01:03,741
...with a very special hunger.

674
01:01:04,212 --> 01:01:06,237
Not for food or drink...

675
01:01:06,237 --> 01:01:09,178
...or love. You can't have
any of those.

676
01:01:09,584 --> 01:01:13,918
You must live to feed only
on the applause and the fame.

677
01:01:15,223 --> 01:01:17,282
For some of us, it's enough.

678
01:01:18,259 --> 01:01:20,159
I'd rather be dead.

679
01:01:23,865 --> 01:01:25,162
So...

680
01:01:25,162 --> 01:01:26,960
...we are in time.

681
01:01:29,704 --> 01:01:31,365
You told her?

682
01:01:34,375 --> 01:01:36,275
Then we have no choice.

683
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:39,345
- What are you gonna do?
- Mike Charles knew the secret.

684
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:41,377
He wanted to be one of us.

685
01:01:41,377 --> 01:01:44,143
When we refused,
he threatened to talk.

686
01:01:44,143 --> 01:01:47,253
We couldn't risk that with him
and we can't risk it with you.

687
01:01:47,622 --> 01:01:48,919
Wait.

688
01:01:51,459 --> 01:01:53,222
There is another way.

689
01:01:53,222 --> 01:01:55,885
You once told me
about your ambitions...

690
01:01:55,885 --> 01:01:58,760
...that you'd do anything
for fame and stardom.

691
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,725
You can have your wish.

692
01:02:02,970 --> 01:02:04,301
No.

693
01:02:04,739 --> 01:02:07,606
- How soon can you operate?
- Immediately.

694
01:02:08,242 --> 01:02:10,142
- No!
- Nurse!

695
01:02:17,618 --> 01:02:19,609
And here are the stars
of this production:

696
01:02:19,609 --> 01:02:22,756
Bruce Benton
and the lovely Carla Hayes.

697
01:02:22,957 --> 01:02:25,858
Miss Hayes, I understand that
your performance in this picture...

698
01:02:25,858 --> 01:02:29,793
...indicates that you'll soon be in
the top ten in filmdom.

699
01:02:31,399 --> 01:02:34,300
- Look, there's Carla Hayes!
- Isn't she a doll!

700
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:36,937
A living doll!

701
01:02:43,377 --> 01:02:44,935
There, there, that's all right.

702
01:02:44,935 --> 01:02:47,377
Now, don't be afraid.
That's all in your mind.

703
01:02:47,377 --> 01:02:50,449
That was a warning
sounding in your mind.

704
01:02:50,449 --> 01:02:53,951
It's a warning of things
that can be, of course.

705
01:02:54,155 --> 01:02:56,555
For now, they are without
substance, they're images.

706
01:02:56,555 --> 01:02:59,249
They're the kind of things
that dreams are made of.

707
01:02:59,249 --> 01:03:03,022
Oh, the mind is a strange animal,
isn't it?

708
01:03:03,231 --> 01:03:05,961
It can turn on you like a panther.

709
01:03:05,961 --> 01:03:09,934
But, of course, like a panther,
it can be tamed...

710
01:03:09,934 --> 01:03:14,200
...by certain people. And that's a kind
of a blessing, don't you agree?

711
01:03:15,042 --> 01:03:16,669
I don't know why we came here.

712
01:03:17,044 --> 01:03:18,909
For the mystery and the excitement.

713
01:03:18,909 --> 01:03:22,538
But you have obtained more
than you bargained for.

714
01:03:22,538 --> 01:03:26,949
- You've obtained knowledge.
- You're quite a philosopher.

715
01:03:27,421 --> 01:03:29,184
Yes, I try to be.

716
01:03:29,184 --> 01:03:32,849
Now, who is next?
Who wants to meet the goddess...

717
01:03:32,849 --> 01:03:35,962
...and take this fascinating journey?
You?

718
01:03:35,962 --> 01:03:40,089
- Dorothy, don't.
- Don't worry. I'm not afraid.

719
01:03:42,103 --> 01:03:46,130
Look at the shears.
Look at the shears.

720
01:03:46,507 --> 01:03:48,099
Deeply, deeply...

721
01:03:48,099 --> 01:03:50,744
...you gaze at the shears.

722
01:03:51,212 --> 01:03:53,737
Look at the shears of fate.

723
01:04:33,788 --> 01:04:36,416
Miss Endicott? I'm Maxine Chambers.

724
01:04:36,416 --> 01:04:37,956
Leo Winston's manager.

725
01:04:37,956 --> 01:04:40,355
I saw from his diary
he was expecting you today.

726
01:04:40,355 --> 01:04:42,553
I thought you were interviewing
him yesterday.

727
01:04:42,553 --> 01:04:44,891
He had to rush off to a concert,
as you know...

728
01:04:44,891 --> 01:04:46,761
...so we thought
we'd continue today.

729
01:04:46,761 --> 01:04:48,162
I see.

730
01:04:48,162 --> 01:04:50,702
I'm afraid he won't be able
to spare you much time.

731
01:04:50,702 --> 01:04:53,739
- He has to rehearse this evening.
- Thank you.

732
01:05:03,484 --> 01:05:06,817
- Milk and sugar?
- No, thank you.

733
01:05:08,723 --> 01:05:10,520
I really hate to stop.

734
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:12,852
There's so much more
I'd like to know about you.

735
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:16,257
If I gave your readers any more
material, they'd complain of eyestrain.

736
01:05:16,257 --> 01:05:18,489
I wasn't thinking of my readers,
Mr. Winston.

737
01:05:19,967 --> 01:05:21,901
You're very flattering.

738
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,435
You really do love music, don't you?

739
01:05:28,435 --> 01:05:30,304
Yes, I do.

740
01:05:30,645 --> 01:05:33,375
In that case, perhaps
you'd better meet Euterpe.

741
01:05:33,915 --> 01:05:35,382
Who?

742
01:05:35,716 --> 01:05:37,877
Come in here, and I'll show you.

743
01:05:46,627 --> 01:05:49,027
Oh, Euterpe, the goddess of music.

744
01:05:49,931 --> 01:05:51,489
Yes.

745
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:55,492
Yes, it was a present from my mother
before she died.

746
01:05:58,973 --> 01:06:02,636
Euterpe and I have been together
for years now.

747
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:11,714
Shall we play something
for the lady?

748
01:06:54,929 --> 01:06:57,193
I'm sorry.
I'm afraid that wasn't very good.

749
01:06:57,398 --> 01:06:58,888
Oh, I shouldn't have let you.

750
01:06:58,888 --> 01:07:01,159
You must be tired
after last night's concert.

751
01:07:01,369 --> 01:07:02,119
No.

752
01:07:03,104 --> 01:07:05,197
No, it's not that.

753
01:07:05,973 --> 01:07:09,170
It's just that
Euterpe isn't used to you yet.

754
01:07:09,170 --> 01:07:12,073
Please accept my apologies for her.

755
01:07:12,073 --> 01:07:15,010
Perhaps she doesn't like me.

756
01:07:17,518 --> 01:07:18,883
I do.

757
01:07:21,222 --> 01:07:23,588
I was just thinking...

758
01:07:24,291 --> 01:07:26,384
...you're quite a lonely person,
aren't you?

759
01:07:26,384 --> 01:07:28,118
What makes you say that?

760
01:07:29,096 --> 01:07:31,621
This habit you have
of talking to yourself.

761
01:07:31,621 --> 01:07:34,165
I couldn't help noticing
this afternoon.

762
01:07:34,602 --> 01:07:37,571
I was talking to Euterpe.

763
01:07:38,105 --> 01:07:40,938
You mean, I'm going
to have a piano for a rival?

764
01:07:41,475 --> 01:07:43,409
No, it's...

765
01:07:43,844 --> 01:07:46,711
It's just that I haven't had time to...

766
01:07:48,416 --> 01:07:51,908
Believe me, Dorothy,
you have no rivals.

767
01:07:54,688 --> 01:07:57,555
It's no good.
I'm making too many mistakes.

768
01:07:58,759 --> 01:08:01,159
- Why?
- I don't know.

769
01:08:01,629 --> 01:08:02,960
Don't you?

770
01:08:03,697 --> 01:08:06,564
- How many hours do you practice?
- Quite enough.

771
01:08:06,801 --> 01:08:08,598
Until what time
are you out every night?

772
01:08:08,598 --> 01:08:11,294
I can't see what possible
difference that makes.

773
01:08:11,294 --> 01:08:14,441
Leo, I'm sorry
if I'm speaking out of turn...

774
01:08:14,441 --> 01:08:17,076
...but I'm your friend,
I'm not just your manager.

775
01:08:17,378 --> 01:08:19,778
And I can't stand by
and watch that girl...

776
01:08:19,778 --> 01:08:22,142
...take over your life,
ruin your career.

777
01:08:22,142 --> 01:08:24,716
You sound exactly like my mother.

778
01:08:24,716 --> 01:08:27,911
Whenever I used to bring a girl home,
all she'd say to me was...

779
01:08:27,911 --> 01:08:30,489
...that it was going
to ruin my career.

780
01:08:30,489 --> 01:08:32,626
You're in love with her.

781
01:08:34,328 --> 01:08:35,989
Yes.

782
01:08:38,365 --> 01:08:39,923
And I think she loves me too.

783
01:08:40,234 --> 01:08:41,496
Well, in that case...

784
01:08:41,496 --> 01:08:44,433
...you're just going to have to try
and make her understand.

785
01:08:44,433 --> 01:08:46,971
She just can't go on
being so demanding.

786
01:08:48,175 --> 01:08:49,938
Look, Maxine...

787
01:08:50,377 --> 01:08:53,312
...you're a good manager
and a good friend.

788
01:08:53,581 --> 01:08:56,641
But you don't have to worry
about me in either capacity.

789
01:08:56,641 --> 01:08:58,978
Dorothy hasn't ruined my life.

790
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:02,380
For the first time in years,
I feel really happy.

791
01:09:24,011 --> 01:09:25,011
Leo?

792
01:09:37,291 --> 01:09:38,849
Leo?

793
01:09:41,962 --> 01:09:43,623
Leo?

794
01:09:50,971 --> 01:09:52,996
What's the matter?

795
01:09:54,175 --> 01:09:55,972
Are you all right?

796
01:09:58,445 --> 01:10:00,140
Yes, of course.

797
01:10:05,553 --> 01:10:08,386
I was just working something out
for my next concert.

798
01:10:08,386 --> 01:10:11,389
I shouldn't have interrupted,
but I've got something for you...

799
01:10:11,389 --> 01:10:13,823
...and I couldn't wait
to give it to you.

800
01:10:16,730 --> 01:10:19,893
And we're invited
to the Harcourts' tonight.

801
01:10:24,638 --> 01:10:26,799
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

802
01:10:27,241 --> 01:10:28,970
Yes, it's lovely.

803
01:10:31,278 --> 01:10:33,007
Dorothy...

804
01:10:33,614 --> 01:10:36,583
- ... about tonight-
- Yes. Pick me up at 8:00.

805
01:10:40,254 --> 01:10:42,188
Yes, of course.

806
01:10:42,456 --> 01:10:44,549
Let's go and have a drink.

807
01:10:58,272 --> 01:11:00,069
Leo, what's the matter?

808
01:11:00,069 --> 01:11:02,232
Nothing.

809
01:11:03,344 --> 01:11:06,438
When I came in there,
you were sitting...

810
01:11:06,847 --> 01:11:09,577
...as if you were in a trance.

811
01:11:09,817 --> 01:11:11,978
I was just tired.

812
01:11:12,253 --> 01:11:14,778
There's no need to worry about me.

813
01:11:15,256 --> 01:11:17,349
Tell me the truth.

814
01:11:19,193 --> 01:11:22,560
Oh, very well. I suppose
you've got to know sooner or later.

815
01:11:24,098 --> 01:11:26,965
It's Euterpe. She resents you.

816
01:11:27,568 --> 01:11:28,796
You see...

817
01:11:28,796 --> 01:11:31,631
...I've been trying
to communicate with her.

818
01:11:32,273 --> 01:11:35,333
She thinks you're hurting me
and preventing me from working.

819
01:11:35,709 --> 01:11:38,200
- She wants to protect me.
- Is this some sort of joke...

820
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:40,404
...pretending that a piano is a-?

821
01:11:53,927 --> 01:11:57,590
No, I haven't come here
to talk about myself.

822
01:11:58,132 --> 01:12:00,396
But you've got to do
something about Leo.

823
01:12:00,834 --> 01:12:04,099
You've got to cancel his tour,
he's in no condition for it.

824
01:12:04,405 --> 01:12:06,532
If we don't do something,
he'll have a breakdown.

825
01:12:06,532 --> 01:12:07,935
Yes, I know.

826
01:12:08,676 --> 01:12:11,144
If Leo isn't well, it's because
you're smothering him.

827
01:12:12,446 --> 01:12:15,472
You're smothering him
with your demands on his time...

828
01:12:15,472 --> 01:12:17,139
...your possessiveness.

829
01:12:17,139 --> 01:12:21,379
You just aren't the sort of person
Leo needs, believe me.

830
01:12:21,689 --> 01:12:24,590
- I love him.
- Do you?

831
01:12:24,958 --> 01:12:28,189
Or do you just love the idea of being
the wife of a world-famous pianist?

832
01:12:28,762 --> 01:12:30,821
Is your love real...

833
01:12:30,821 --> 01:12:33,990
- ... or just selfish?
- Oh, you're the selfish one.

834
01:12:34,201 --> 01:12:37,830
All you're interested in is making
money out of Leo's career.

835
01:12:38,038 --> 01:12:40,029
First his mother and now you...

836
01:12:40,029 --> 01:12:43,802
...and this ridiculous story
about Euterpe.

837
01:12:44,211 --> 01:12:46,702
- Euterpe?
- Don't pretend you don't know about it.

838
01:12:46,702 --> 01:12:50,077
You probably encourage it.
But it won't work. I won't let it.

839
01:12:50,751 --> 01:12:53,049
Leo belongs to me now.

840
01:13:06,667 --> 01:13:07,667
Leo?

841
01:13:09,803 --> 01:13:11,600
Leo?

842
01:13:12,673 --> 01:13:14,402
Leo?

843
01:13:14,775 --> 01:13:15,855
Leo! Leo!

844
01:13:19,346 --> 01:13:21,371
Dorothy.

845
01:13:28,856 --> 01:13:31,324
I heard the piano playing...

846
01:13:31,859 --> 01:13:35,124
- ... and then you answered the door.
- Yes.

847
01:13:36,764 --> 01:13:39,562
But that's not possible. You...

848
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:43,661
You couldn't have come from
the piano to the door so quickly.

849
01:13:44,138 --> 01:13:46,606
I wasn't playing, it was Euterpe.

850
01:14:04,358 --> 01:14:07,191
- Leo, come here.
- It's only a metronome.

851
01:14:07,191 --> 01:14:08,726
Yes...

852
01:14:08,962 --> 01:14:11,556
...and this is only a piano.

853
01:14:12,566 --> 01:14:16,764
There's nothing here
but wood and metal and ivory.

854
01:14:16,764 --> 01:14:18,996
It's got no life of its own.

855
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:21,906
And it can't interfere with ours.

856
01:14:24,778 --> 01:14:28,373
You're tired.
We'll go away together.

857
01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:32,383
- Away from-
- What about my concert tour?

858
01:14:32,653 --> 01:14:35,520
I spoke to Maxine today.
I told her she'd have to postpone it.

859
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,384
What did she say?

860
01:14:37,384 --> 01:14:39,458
She'll come around.

861
01:15:10,190 --> 01:15:12,454
You're not angry with me, are you?

862
01:15:12,454 --> 01:15:14,924
No, of course not.

863
01:15:17,297 --> 01:15:20,357
I know I'm tired. It's just that
I've never missed a tour before.

864
01:15:20,357 --> 01:15:22,729
Leo, you'd better
make up your mind.

865
01:15:22,729 --> 01:15:27,670
Either we go away together,
or I'll go by myself.

866
01:15:29,710 --> 01:15:32,440
- You really mean that, don't you?
- Yes.

867
01:15:34,248 --> 01:15:36,842
In that case, I have no choice.

868
01:15:37,885 --> 01:15:39,785
When do you want to leave?

869
01:15:42,356 --> 01:15:44,551
Well, we could go tonight.

870
01:15:45,058 --> 01:15:50,621
We could ring Maxine from
wherever we are in the morning.

871
01:15:52,199 --> 01:15:55,293
You go and pack,
and then I'll pick up my things.

872
01:16:34,608 --> 01:16:36,269
Leo?

873
01:16:40,681 --> 01:16:42,410
Leo?

874
01:16:42,410 --> 01:16:43,490
Leo? Leo?

875
01:16:46,086 --> 01:16:47,576
Leo!

876
01:16:48,655 --> 01:16:50,179
Leo.

877
01:17:11,044 --> 01:17:11,794
No.

878
01:17:20,487 --> 01:17:21,749
No!

879
01:17:25,025 --> 01:17:26,652
No! No!

880
01:17:27,861 --> 01:17:30,659
No! No! No!

881
01:18:11,338 --> 01:18:14,535
Look what he's done.
He's frightened you.

882
01:18:15,242 --> 01:18:17,733
- No, I'm all right.
- What did you see?

883
01:18:19,179 --> 01:18:22,114
- Just an illusion.
- An illusion?

884
01:18:22,949 --> 01:18:24,382
That's very good!

885
01:18:24,584 --> 01:18:29,351
Call it whatever you want.
An illusion, a fantasy, a memory.

886
01:18:29,589 --> 01:18:31,989
Now, that's very good too.
A memory...

887
01:18:32,225 --> 01:18:34,193
...but a memory of the future.

888
01:18:34,193 --> 01:18:37,990
A memory of the shape
of things to come.

889
01:18:38,398 --> 01:18:39,626
Now then...

890
01:18:39,866 --> 01:18:41,891
...which of you two gentlemen...

891
01:18:41,891 --> 01:18:46,301
...will be next to take this plunge
into the river of time?

892
01:18:46,773 --> 01:18:48,673
Oh, not you.

893
01:18:48,673 --> 01:18:52,039
Afraid. Are you afraid?

894
01:18:53,113 --> 01:18:54,580
You?

895
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:55,330
No.

896
01:18:56,783 --> 01:19:00,116
As a matter of fact,
I've always wanted...

897
01:19:00,487 --> 01:19:02,819
...to sample your wares.

898
01:19:04,291 --> 01:19:05,758
Very well.

899
01:19:06,326 --> 01:19:08,920
Very well then. Look at the shears.

900
01:19:09,463 --> 01:19:11,761
Look at the shears, sir.

901
01:19:11,761 --> 01:19:16,198
Look at the shears.
Deeper and deeper and deeper.

902
01:19:16,436 --> 01:19:18,563
Look at the shears.

903
01:19:18,972 --> 01:19:21,839
Look at the shears of fate.

904
01:19:42,162 --> 01:19:44,596
First edition, isn't it?

905
01:19:44,965 --> 01:19:47,433
A great rarity to the collector
of Edgar Allan Poe.

906
01:19:47,433 --> 01:19:50,195
Yes, I know. Might I ask...

907
01:19:50,195 --> 01:19:52,304
- ... where you obtained it?
- It isn't mine.

908
01:19:52,304 --> 01:19:54,030
This gentleman owns the collection.

909
01:19:54,030 --> 01:19:56,971
Lancelot Canning,
this is Mr. Ronald Wyatt.

910
01:19:56,971 --> 01:20:00,341
I was just admiring your collection.

911
01:20:00,341 --> 01:20:03,483
Does this volume
happen to be for sale?

912
01:20:03,483 --> 01:20:06,210
Oh, I'm afraid not.
As you probably know...

913
01:20:06,210 --> 01:20:08,149
...only six of these
are known to exist.

914
01:20:08,149 --> 01:20:12,553
- Yes, I'm well aware of that.
- You are interested in Poe?

915
01:20:12,553 --> 01:20:17,129
Mr. Canning is probably the world's
greatest collector of Poe memorabilia.

916
01:20:17,497 --> 01:20:21,797
I'm prepared to pay
a very good price.

917
01:20:22,235 --> 01:20:25,693
I'm sorry. My collection
must remain complete.

918
01:20:25,693 --> 01:20:28,204
Mr. Canning has many things
besides these books...

919
01:20:28,204 --> 01:20:30,741
...more than you
can possibly imagine.

920
01:20:32,279 --> 01:20:34,008
"Al Aaraaf. "

921
01:20:34,214 --> 01:20:37,445
- And "Tamerlane. "
- Yes. And Collected Poems, 1829.

922
01:20:37,445 --> 01:20:40,814
- Boston edition.
- Yes. Cost you $ 15,000 at least...

923
01:20:40,814 --> 01:20:42,579
...at Sotheby's last year.

924
01:20:42,956 --> 01:20:47,359
Prose Romance, 1843,
sold in that year for 12 cents.

925
01:20:47,727 --> 01:20:50,958
Value now $50,000.

926
01:20:51,298 --> 01:20:53,323
We have much in common.

927
01:20:53,323 --> 01:20:55,365
If you should ever come
to the States...

928
01:20:55,365 --> 01:20:57,628
...perhaps you might care
to see my collection.

929
01:20:57,628 --> 01:20:59,567
You live in America?

930
01:20:59,773 --> 01:21:03,607
My whole life is centered around
Edgar Allan Poe in every respect.

931
01:21:03,607 --> 01:21:05,938
Well, I will most certainly
take advantage...

932
01:21:05,938 --> 01:21:08,774
...of your invitation
when I'm in Maryland.

933
01:21:08,774 --> 01:21:11,281
- I shall look forward to seeing you.
- Yes, thank you.

934
01:21:11,281 --> 01:21:13,112
Excuse me.

935
01:21:34,641 --> 01:21:36,404
Mr. Wyatt?

936
01:21:36,404 --> 01:21:38,203
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

937
01:21:38,203 --> 01:21:40,608
I didn't expect to see you again
quite so soon.

938
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:43,647
It's interesting, very interesting.

939
01:21:43,647 --> 01:21:45,307
My grandfather's idea.

940
01:21:45,307 --> 01:21:47,953
He built this house
when he started his Poe collection.

941
01:21:47,953 --> 01:21:50,521
My father and I merely
followed in his footsteps.

942
01:21:50,891 --> 01:21:54,156
That's Poe's cravat. He wore it in
Baltimore during his last appearance.

943
01:21:54,156 --> 01:21:57,922
You have other items
from his wardrobe as well.

944
01:21:58,131 --> 01:22:01,191
My collection is very complete.

945
01:22:02,369 --> 01:22:04,997
Did you know
that he played the flute?

946
01:22:05,538 --> 01:22:08,029
No. Did he really?

947
01:22:09,175 --> 01:22:12,144
There. Oh, I'm sorry,
I should've asked you before.

948
01:22:12,144 --> 01:22:14,337
- Would you care for a drink?
- Yes, thank you.

949
01:22:14,337 --> 01:22:15,845
- Whiskey?
- Yes.

950
01:22:15,845 --> 01:22:18,541
- Or sherry?
- Oh, yes, thank you.

951
01:22:29,296 --> 01:22:31,628
Oh, this is lovely.

952
01:22:33,733 --> 01:22:35,325
Yes.

953
01:22:41,441 --> 01:22:45,104
- To your health.
- And to your collection.

954
01:22:45,312 --> 01:22:46,973
There speaks the true collector.

955
01:22:46,973 --> 01:22:49,775
My father was like that.
And so was his.

956
01:22:50,317 --> 01:22:53,081
Today they'd both be called fanatics.

957
01:22:53,386 --> 01:22:57,618
It's true. Collecting can become
a kind of mania.

958
01:23:04,731 --> 01:23:07,359
What a strange man he was.

959
01:23:07,359 --> 01:23:12,562
What a fascination he exerted over
the minds of those who loved fantasy.

960
01:23:14,574 --> 01:23:16,565
Or do you think
it's because people...

961
01:23:16,565 --> 01:23:19,541
...are fascinated
by the mystery of death?

962
01:23:20,780 --> 01:23:22,475
No one will ever equal
his knowledge...

963
01:23:22,475 --> 01:23:25,140
...of the secrets
that lie beyond the grave.

964
01:23:26,019 --> 01:23:28,544
Let us drink to the immortal...

965
01:23:28,544 --> 01:23:31,589
...Edgar Allan Poe.

966
01:24:09,262 --> 01:24:12,254
Oh, no. No, thank you,
I've had enough.

967
01:24:12,532 --> 01:24:15,933
I go on drinking like this,
you'll think I'm Poe himself.

968
01:24:21,007 --> 01:24:22,565
Thank you.

969
01:24:23,576 --> 01:24:27,137
Now, then.
Do you want to see downstairs?

970
01:24:27,514 --> 01:24:30,677
- Why? What's down there?
- The rest of my treasures.

971
01:24:30,677 --> 01:24:33,011
That's why you encouraged me
to drink, wasn't it?

972
01:24:33,011 --> 01:24:35,279
- You wanted me to show you more.
- Oh, really.

973
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:39,482
Oh, it doesn't matter.
I was going to show you anyway.

974
01:24:43,396 --> 01:24:45,091
Come along.

975
01:24:49,436 --> 01:24:53,566
There's one thing you must
promise me first.

976
01:24:54,174 --> 01:24:56,165
What I'm going to show you now...

977
01:24:56,165 --> 01:24:59,334
- ... will remain a secret between us?
- Oh, yes, of course.

978
01:24:59,546 --> 01:25:02,572
Good. Good man.

979
01:25:21,067 --> 01:25:23,592
You're a very privileged man,
Mr. Wyatt.

980
01:25:23,592 --> 01:25:27,763
Not a living soul has been
down here since my father died.

981
01:26:09,048 --> 01:26:10,640
It's fabulous.

982
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:12,978
Absolutely fabulous.

983
01:26:13,219 --> 01:26:15,949
Here are my real treasures.

984
01:26:25,698 --> 01:26:29,566
Poe's original manuscript?
Yes, but-

985
01:26:29,566 --> 01:26:32,762
I thought they were all
in university collections.

986
01:26:33,006 --> 01:26:34,530
See for yourself.

987
01:26:34,741 --> 01:26:37,539
You saw his letters upstairs.
You recognize his handwriting.

988
01:26:37,539 --> 01:26:39,769
- This is the same.
- Yes, but...

989
01:26:39,769 --> 01:26:43,973
...I don't recognize the title,
The House of the Worm.

990
01:26:47,220 --> 01:26:52,283
Is this an unpublished work?

991
01:26:52,659 --> 01:26:54,149
All these are unpublished.

992
01:26:54,149 --> 01:26:57,728
I've read everything
ever written about Poe.

993
01:26:58,131 --> 01:27:01,328
I never read any mention
of unpublished stories.

994
01:27:01,328 --> 01:27:05,562
Nobody else knows. But you can
see for yourself, this is genuine.

995
01:27:09,008 --> 01:27:11,977
I suppose you wouldn't be
interested in...

996
01:27:12,679 --> 01:27:14,271
...parting with any of these, huh?

997
01:27:14,714 --> 01:27:17,649
That's right. I wouldn't.

998
01:27:30,029 --> 01:27:34,659
Well, what part did this box
play in the life of Poe?

999
01:27:36,069 --> 01:27:37,934
Oh, nothing.

1000
01:27:39,639 --> 01:27:41,368
Well, why is it here?

1001
01:27:43,676 --> 01:27:46,804
I'll tell you about it
when we get upstairs.

1002
01:27:46,804 --> 01:27:49,073
It's getting late.

1003
01:27:51,150 --> 01:27:54,745
Please, please. No, please-
No, I-

1004
01:27:55,154 --> 01:27:57,782
Oh, I must see more.

1005
01:27:58,758 --> 01:28:00,089
No.

1006
01:28:00,089 --> 01:28:02,421
The Further Adventures of...

1007
01:28:02,762 --> 01:28:05,196
...Arthur Gordon Pym.

1008
01:28:07,834 --> 01:28:10,564
Look at that paper, look.
Look at-

1009
01:28:12,005 --> 01:28:14,064
This paper is...

1010
01:28:14,474 --> 01:28:16,533
Why, it's almost new.

1011
01:28:17,844 --> 01:28:20,278
Oh, yes. Yes, look at...

1012
01:28:21,114 --> 01:28:25,346
Look at the watermark.
"Weber and Sons, 19-"

1013
01:28:28,388 --> 01:28:29,912
1966.

1014
01:28:30,723 --> 01:28:33,851
Well, that's impossible.
It's a mistake.

1015
01:28:33,851 --> 01:28:37,190
- It's just a trick of the light.
- Oh, it's a trick, all right.

1016
01:28:37,430 --> 01:28:40,558
And I want to know the truth.

1017
01:28:41,334 --> 01:28:43,199
- We must go upstairs now.
- No.

1018
01:28:43,199 --> 01:28:46,532
No, you're going to tell me.
You're going to tell me, or I'll-

1019
01:28:47,573 --> 01:28:52,010
I'll break my promise of silence.
Now, what's the secret?

1020
01:28:55,248 --> 01:28:56,647
Yes.

1021
01:28:56,883 --> 01:28:59,317
You wrote these stories, didn't you?

1022
01:28:59,752 --> 01:29:03,552
Didn't you?
You wrote them, didn't you?

1023
01:29:08,928 --> 01:29:11,761
- No, I didn't write them.
- Then who did?

1024
01:29:12,031 --> 01:29:13,692
Who did?

1025
01:29:24,344 --> 01:29:26,676
- This box.
- You told me it had nothing to do...

1026
01:29:26,676 --> 01:29:28,643
- ... with the life of Poe.
- That's right.

1027
01:29:28,643 --> 01:29:31,545
It had nothing to do with his life.

1028
01:29:31,951 --> 01:29:34,476
But it had to do with his death.

1029
01:29:35,822 --> 01:29:37,551
My grandfather...

1030
01:29:37,551 --> 01:29:40,659
...made money by selling cadavers
to medical students.

1031
01:29:41,127 --> 01:29:42,719
Robbing graves?

1032
01:29:43,029 --> 01:29:46,658
One of the graves he opened
was the last resting place...

1033
01:29:46,658 --> 01:29:48,733
...of Edgar Allan Poe.

1034
01:29:49,102 --> 01:29:51,570
The body, of course,
had crumbled to dust.

1035
01:29:52,004 --> 01:29:55,531
But he gathered that dust
and kept it...

1036
01:29:56,008 --> 01:29:57,976
...in this box.

1037
01:30:01,314 --> 01:30:04,943
So you see, he really was
the greatest collector.

1038
01:30:05,485 --> 01:30:09,216
He even collected
Edgar Allan Poe himself.

1039
01:30:15,828 --> 01:30:19,264
You're lying! We both can see
the box is empty.

1040
01:30:21,734 --> 01:30:25,534
But- And this is the real secret.

1041
01:30:27,473 --> 01:30:29,964
- my grandfather was more
than a grave robber.

1042
01:30:30,810 --> 01:30:32,778
He was a student of the occult.

1043
01:30:33,212 --> 01:30:35,942
Did you know that there are ways
to raise the dead?

1044
01:30:36,616 --> 01:30:38,811
To reanimate the dust?

1045
01:30:39,285 --> 01:30:41,549
Now, those stories by Poe...

1046
01:30:42,088 --> 01:30:44,750
...filled with nameless terrors...

1047
01:30:44,957 --> 01:30:46,515
...are written on modern paper...

1048
01:30:46,515 --> 01:30:48,990
...because Poe has been
brought back to us.

1049
01:30:49,362 --> 01:30:50,590
He's still alive.

1050
01:30:51,197 --> 01:30:53,256
You expect me to believe that?

1051
01:30:55,902 --> 01:30:58,166
You can believe what you like.

1052
01:30:58,638 --> 01:31:01,334
Now, you put those
manuscripts back.

1053
01:31:01,874 --> 01:31:04,274
We're going upstairs.

1054
01:31:11,617 --> 01:31:13,710
There's a third key here.

1055
01:31:15,988 --> 01:31:18,218
Is it for that door?

1056
01:31:19,692 --> 01:31:20,442
No.

1057
01:31:21,794 --> 01:31:22,544
No.

1058
01:31:25,031 --> 01:31:27,363
Then what's it for?

1059
01:31:28,634 --> 01:31:30,898
- Give me those keys.
- No.

1060
01:31:31,471 --> 01:31:35,168
No. You're hiding more treasures
from me, aren't you?

1061
01:31:35,942 --> 01:31:39,935
I want to see if you've been
telling me the truth. I want to see!

1062
01:31:40,146 --> 01:31:42,740
- You give me those keys.
- No, I won't!

1063
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:43,490
No!

1064
01:33:37,697 --> 01:33:40,461
Mr. Poe. I am...

1065
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:42,993
...Ronald Wyatt.

1066
01:33:45,004 --> 01:33:47,165
I want to help you to...

1067
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:51,105
To release all these new works.

1068
01:33:51,410 --> 01:33:56,143
Now, with your knowledge
of the unknown...

1069
01:33:56,682 --> 01:33:59,014
...of death itself...

1070
01:33:59,685 --> 01:34:01,846
Knowledge of death?

1071
01:34:02,488 --> 01:34:04,285
I pray to die.

1072
01:34:04,991 --> 01:34:08,188
To die? Again?

1073
01:34:08,828 --> 01:34:12,628
I sought and found the unknown.

1074
01:34:13,299 --> 01:34:15,893
Made a deal with the devil.

1075
01:34:16,669 --> 01:34:18,569
Eternal life.

1076
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:24,876
To preserve the works
of Edgar Allan Poe for the world...

1077
01:34:24,876 --> 01:34:28,013
...is the work of God,
not the devil.

1078
01:34:28,314 --> 01:34:33,013
To condemn a man to a living hell
is the work of the devil.

1079
01:34:33,013 --> 01:34:36,052
And one's soul
can only be released...

1080
01:34:36,052 --> 01:34:39,214
...if a living soul replaces his...

1081
01:34:39,214 --> 01:34:41,360
...in the devil's domain.

1082
01:34:44,964 --> 01:34:48,024
Is there no other way
to release you?

1083
01:34:49,268 --> 01:34:52,829
There is another way. By fire.

1084
01:34:55,007 --> 01:34:56,998
I have the means...

1085
01:34:56,998 --> 01:34:58,609
...here.

1086
01:35:00,813 --> 01:35:02,804
But in return...

1087
01:35:05,551 --> 01:35:09,112
...you must tell me more
about the unknown.

1088
01:35:09,455 --> 01:35:12,583
Yes. Yes, I will.

1089
01:35:23,002 --> 01:35:26,597
If you liberate one who has made
a pact with the devil...

1090
01:35:26,939 --> 01:35:30,340
...you yourself become
the devil's slave.

1091
01:35:30,743 --> 01:35:32,734
You are trapped, my friend.

1092
01:35:32,734 --> 01:35:35,676
Trapped. Is that not a good ending...

1093
01:35:35,676 --> 01:35:39,579
...for the last story
of Edgar Allan Poe?

1094
01:36:00,906 --> 01:36:02,806
You are trapped.

1095
01:36:02,806 --> 01:36:04,636
Trapped!

1096
01:36:12,618 --> 01:36:15,416
No, it can't be.

1097
01:36:15,416 --> 01:36:17,385
What did you see?

1098
01:36:18,524 --> 01:36:20,151
I can't believe it.

1099
01:36:20,826 --> 01:36:23,124
What is it that you cannot believe,
my friend?

1100
01:36:23,863 --> 01:36:25,330
You.

1101
01:36:25,664 --> 01:36:27,598
It really is.

1102
01:36:30,169 --> 01:36:32,194
What do you mean?

1103
01:36:35,141 --> 01:36:36,768
You know what he saw.

1104
01:36:38,410 --> 01:36:39,638
Who are you?

1105
01:36:40,179 --> 01:36:41,510
Me?

1106
01:36:41,747 --> 01:36:44,443
My name is Diabolo, my friend.

1107
01:36:44,443 --> 01:36:46,585
Dr. Diabolo.

1108
01:36:46,919 --> 01:36:49,479
I'm very well-known
for my excursions...

1109
01:36:49,479 --> 01:36:52,852
...into the unexplored regions
of the mind.

1110
01:36:53,392 --> 01:36:55,326
Now let's see who's next.
Who hasn't-?

1111
01:36:55,326 --> 01:36:58,554
- Why, you are, of course, aren't you?
- No, not me.

1112
01:36:58,864 --> 01:37:01,799
Oh, yes. You've paid your money.
You'll receive full value, sir.

1113
01:37:02,001 --> 01:37:04,162
No. I came in here to see-

1114
01:37:04,162 --> 01:37:07,203
There's something going on
I don't wanna know anything about.

1115
01:37:07,203 --> 01:37:09,603
I don't care whether you
want to know about it!

1116
01:37:09,603 --> 01:37:13,074
You are going to face that sibyl
and look into the future.

1117
01:37:13,074 --> 01:37:15,577
- I won't!
- You are going to do what I tell you.

1118
01:37:15,577 --> 01:37:17,716
- You are going to-
- It's you. You're mad.

1119
01:37:17,716 --> 01:37:19,407
Mad!

1120
01:37:20,252 --> 01:37:23,119
But you're not gonna
get away with it.

1121
01:37:23,923 --> 01:37:26,187
Because I'm going to kill you.

1122
01:37:26,187 --> 01:37:27,825
I'm gonna kill you!

1123
01:37:38,637 --> 01:37:40,764
Come on, let's get out of here.

1124
01:38:10,703 --> 01:38:12,796
You were great tonight.

1125
01:38:13,105 --> 01:38:15,573
We gave them a good show
for their money.

1126
01:38:16,475 --> 01:38:18,773
A show that money
couldn't buy, doctor.

1127
01:38:24,383 --> 01:38:27,375
Well, I've gotta get outside.

1128
01:38:27,653 --> 01:38:30,178
Gotta get ready
for the next performance.

1129
01:38:30,956 --> 01:38:34,915
So you decided to wait,
eh, Mr. Wyatt?

1130
01:38:35,427 --> 01:38:37,361
I was interested in...

1131
01:38:37,563 --> 01:38:39,087
Making a deal with me too?

1132
01:38:45,337 --> 01:38:47,168
Oh, yes.

1133
01:38:47,673 --> 01:38:50,836
Yes, I think so.

1134
01:38:51,644 --> 01:38:53,544
At the right time.

1135
01:38:54,580 --> 01:38:56,377
Do you have a light?

1136
01:39:39,591 --> 01:39:43,652
Of course, I lose one or two
along the line this way...

1137
01:39:43,652 --> 01:39:45,820
...but it's great for the sport.

1138
01:39:46,031 --> 01:39:48,556
And it's only fair, you know...

1139
01:39:48,867 --> 01:39:51,700
...to give them a chance
to escape my domain.

1140
01:39:54,173 --> 01:39:56,573
But will you?
