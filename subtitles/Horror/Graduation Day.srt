1
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:06,408
Aint that the kid who died a
couple months ago?

2
00:05:08,445 --> 00:05:16,414
Tough. A real shame. You knew her?

3
00:05:22,468 --> 00:05:26,931
You read about those two naked
girls down in San Diego?

4
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,450
It was in all the papers.

5
00:05:35,489 --> 00:05:38,460
I hear they were a couple
of real lesbos.

6
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:44,470
Whats the matter cat got your tongue?

7
00:05:46,508 --> 00:05:50,469
Its okay I got plenty of tongue
for both of us.

8
00:05:57,025 --> 00:05:58,995
Move your hand.

9
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:01,931
Come on give a guy a break,
lm a tax payer.

10
00:06:02,468 --> 00:06:03,936
I said move it.

11
00:06:04,471 --> 00:06:05,598
Youre not one of those
lesbos are you?

12
00:06:15,489 --> 00:06:19,451
Okay. But you even
breathe in my direction,

13
00:06:20,998 --> 00:06:23,467
and youll be eating your
balls for lunch.

14
00:06:25,004 --> 00:06:26,472
You some kind of nut or something?

15
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:51,504
Fucking graduation the make a big deal
out of it, like it was something special.

16
00:07:01,498 --> 00:07:04,128
Let me out.

17
00:07:04,503 --> 00:07:07,133
I thought you wanted to go
to market street.

18
00:07:07,508 --> 00:07:08,874
Alright, alright, Jesus Christ.

19
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,818
Your welcome for the ride lady.

20
00:10:22,695 --> 00:10:25,165
Alright the hell with it, lets
get this show on the road.

21
00:10:26,369 --> 00:10:29,670
We cant take a newspaper
picture without Paula.

22
00:10:29,741 --> 00:10:32,337
Shes the best cross country
runner weve ever had. And you know it.

23
00:10:32,412 --> 00:10:34,347
Had is right.

24
00:10:34,715 --> 00:10:37,515
Hold it down.

25
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,180
Come on coach, shes just
jogging for god sakes.

26
00:10:41,393 --> 00:10:42,520
You know that for a fact?

27
00:10:46,435 --> 00:10:48,028
What did she have to say?

28
00:10:48,738 --> 00:10:51,334
Nothing, I assumed she were to
meet up after homeroom.

29
00:10:51,743 --> 00:10:52,711
Boys in back.

30
00:10:54,748 --> 00:10:56,717
We cant take the
picture without Paula.

31
00:10:58,755 --> 00:11:01,658
How bout it coach. What was
the calculated risk?

32
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,821
how many of us were supposed to
make it through the season alive?

33
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,056
Youre out of line fella

34
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:09,002
Well youve done a lot worse coach.

35
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:13,679
Come on were on a tight schedule
lets just take the picture.

36
00:11:22,728 --> 00:11:26,188
Move in closer. Thats it. Right spot. Come on.

37
00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:51,401
Oh honey am I glad to see you.

38
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,747
Let me take your hat.

39
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:58,752
Youve lost weight. No I havent mom.

40
00:11:58,821 --> 00:12:02,691
Ive been the same weight for 10 years. Really?

41
00:12:03,394 --> 00:12:04,692
Are you alright?

42
00:12:04,897 --> 00:12:07,197
It was just awful. Just awful.

43
00:12:07,735 --> 00:12:12,198
Look honey Anne is home.

44
00:12:12,276 --> 00:12:14,542
No shit she is.

45
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:17,050
Dont talk to my mother like that.

46
00:12:17,117 --> 00:12:22,252
If you dont like it you can go back
to China or wherever you came from.

47
00:12:22,426 --> 00:12:23,724
I mean no one invited you here.

48
00:12:23,795 --> 00:12:29,738
Now please dont fight, Ronalds
joking thats all. Arent you honey?

49
00:12:30,773 --> 00:12:35,736
He didnt mean anything by it. Now
where did you come from this time honey?

50
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:37,474
Guam.

51
00:12:38,119 --> 00:12:43,755
Did you hear that. She came all the
way from Guam for the graduation.

52
00:12:44,462 --> 00:12:45,760
Isnt that nice? Very nice.

53
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:50,765
You cant be too hard on him,
it was a terrible shock.

54
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,778
Ill take you up to Lauras
room you relax for awhile

55
00:12:54,846 --> 00:12:56,781
What about my room mom?

56
00:12:57,885 --> 00:13:02,723
Ronald made it into a dark room.
Hes a terrific photographer.

57
00:13:02,793 --> 00:13:06,526
You wont mind? Lauras room
is nice and tidy.

58
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:08,735
Nobodys been there since she died

59
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:15,245
Okay mom. Come on III show you.

60
00:13:15,313 --> 00:13:18,751
No its alright. I know where it is

How long you gonna stay?

62
00:13:23,793 --> 00:13:27,095
Just until after graduation.

63
00:13:29,303 --> 00:13:30,601
Why?

64
00:13:31,807 --> 00:13:35,438
Ronald will probably
want to know thats all.

65
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,778
Honey? The trophy and insurance
money Lauras I mean.

66
00:13:41,857 --> 00:13:43,952
Do you plan on keeping them?

67
00:13:44,161 --> 00:13:51,800
No mom. Did you hear that Ronald
youll get to keep the money.

68
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:50,836
Why didnt you call us at the airport?
I would have picked you up.

69
00:14:50,904 --> 00:14:55,844
I got here alright. Yeah I can see that.

70
00:14:57,881 --> 00:15:00,886
You got something on your mind?

71
00:15:00,886 --> 00:15:05,829
What did they call you for? I brought
her up like she was my own.

72
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:08,833
I outta to be up their getting
that trophy.

73
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:11,804
Why do you gotta come sniffing around?

74
00:15:12,006 --> 00:15:12,973
I have every right to.

75
00:15:13,173 --> 00:15:16,805
I see the navy hasnt taught
you any manners.

76
00:15:17,848 --> 00:16:20,842
Youre still the big mouth self
centered bitch you were the day you left.

77
00:16:20,918 --> 00:16:23,354
I outta slap some mind into you...

78
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:29,355
I wouldnt if I were you I did learn
a few things in the military.

79
00:16:32,237 --> 00:16:33,866
Bitch!

80
00:16:50,935 --> 00:16:52,904
Hi Sally. Hi.

81
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:48,929
Did I frighten you? Lm sorry.

82
00:17:48,997 --> 00:17:51,797
I was looking for the auditorium.
I must have gotten lost.

83
00:17:51,968 --> 00:17:56,931
Strange you know I used to know this
place like the back of my hand.

84
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,381
The auditorium is over there
you cant miss it.

85
00:18:03,688 --> 00:18:05,850
Thats beautiful

86
00:18:06,927 --> 00:18:08,896

You have lovely eyes.

88
00:18:12,937 --> 00:18:25,756
My sister had lovely eyes like yours.

89
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:05,922
Lets all give our attention to
our principal Mr. Guglione.

90
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,979
Alright seniors.

91
00:19:41,015 --> 00:19:43,484
If you cant behave were just gonna
call the whole thing off.

92
00:19:43,552 --> 00:19:46,990
Is that what you want to see? Is
that what you want to happen?

93
00:19:52,366 --> 00:19:55,997
Well which will it be? Behave or quit.

94
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,509
Which will it be? Behave or quit.

95
00:19:59,044 --> 00:20:03,006
I mean it, lm serious boys and girls.

96
00:20:03,718 --> 00:20:09,524
Graduation is for you,
not for me. Remember that.

97
00:20:10,062 --> 00:20:16,027
Now simmer down, I mean it.
Thats better.

98
00:20:18,076 --> 00:20:22,037
The diplomas are tickets to
the adult world.

99
00:20:22,115 --> 00:20:25,713
You want to get in? You have to
pay the admission charge.

100
00:20:28,092 --> 00:20:32,054
Respect authority do you understand me?

101
00:20:36,105 --> 00:20:39,703
At the exercise tomorrow.
Boy is she weird.

102
00:20:40,612 --> 00:20:42,080
I will call you name and one
up at a time.

103
00:20:42,148 --> 00:20:47,088
You will come up here and I
will hand you a diploma.

104
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:54,090
You will take the diploma with your
left hand and shake your right.

105
00:20:55,137 --> 00:20:57,106
And no jokes about being left handed.

106
00:20:59,143 --> 00:21:02,046
Then the monsignor.

107
00:21:09,093 --> 00:21:12,098
The monsignor will say the benediction.

108
00:21:12,098 --> 00:21:16,059
You will stand there with your heads
bowed. You better be serious.

109
00:21:16,137 --> 00:21:19,074
Then we will get to the special awards.

110
00:21:26,121 --> 00:21:30,082
Boys and girls we have a special
guest with us today.

111
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:34,099
I would like you to give a warm
welcome to Laura Ramsteads sister

112
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:39,767

113
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:52,129
She flew all the way from
Guam to be with us.

114
00:21:54,167 --> 00:22:00,974
During the ceremony we will call for
a moment of silence for Laura.

115
00:22:04,618 --> 00:22:05,744
Boys and girls that will be all today.

116
00:22:16,136 --> 00:22:20,098
Theyre animals I swear they get
worse from year to year.

117
00:22:29,157 --> 00:22:32,128

135
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:06,278
Quiet. Quiet. What.

136
00:28:08,316 --> 00:28:10,285

I dont believe here what is

141
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:28,677
Coach Michaels tells me youre good
enough for the Olympics.

142
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:30,847
He never told me that.

143
00:29:30,918 --> 00:29:33,821
Sally could you do a couple of
turns for me on the bar?

144
00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:35,856
What do you mean a couple turns?

145
00:29:35,927 --> 00:29:39,365

feel up to it today.

147
00:29:42,938 --> 00:29:46,376
The man is here from the paper for
Christ sake. Dont embarrass me.

148
00:29:46,444 --> 00:29:48,880
Hey its okay coach...

149
00:29:48,948 --> 00:29:50,849

Get your little ass up on those
bars and get to work

You broke you concentration. Ive
never seen anything so sloppy.

154
00:30:42,537 --> 00:30:45,474
It doesnt really matter coach.

155
00:30:45,675 --> 00:30:46,767

00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:54,488

159
00:33:58,626 --> 00:34:00,595
This is for you coach.

160
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,198
Sit on it.

161
00:34:36,621 --> 00:34:38,591
What are you doing?

162

Why did you ever leave show business?

164
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:27,433
I never really left it.
Show business is my life.

165
00:35:29,475 --> 00:35:33,414

When you an entertainer as I was.

168
00:35:46,169 --> 00:35:48,139
The bell rang 10 minutes ago.

169
00:35:49,174 --> 00:35:52,145
There arent anymore real classes.
Tomorrow is graduation day.

170
00:35:53,348 --> 00:35:55,647
Mr. Roberts is going to for
the whole summer.

171
00:35:55,718 --> 00:35:58,655
Oh I wish I could go with you.

172
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:02,591
What about it Mr. Roberts you want me
to come back later or what?

173
00:36:02,663 --> 00:36:04,598
Oh no Deloris your right on time.

174
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:07,603
We were just letting it all hang out.
As they say in the industry.

175
00:36:08,306 --> 00:36:11,607
Ill see you and you in the fall.

176
00:36:15,651 --> 00:36:19,613
Goodbye Joanne. Goodbye Doris.
Sing one for me.

177
00:36:25,668 --> 00:36:32,635
Deloris theres now way I can pass you,
summer school is the only answer.

178
00:36:32,712 --> 00:36:34,648
Youve hardly been here. Let me show
you your record. And youll see

179
00:36:37,186 --> 00:36:38,654
What are you doing?

180
00:36:40,693 --> 00:36:46,657
As I was saying. Summer school isnt
all that bad really.

181
00:36:46,735 --> 00:36:51,676
Dont do that. Not here.
Someone could come in.

182
00:37:16,685 --> 00:37:19,154
Blondie would you come in for
a minute, quick like a bunny?

183
00:37:19,222 --> 00:37:20,155
Like a what?

184
00:37:20,224 --> 00:37:23,161
You know like a rabbit, quick, chop chop.

185
00:37:33,713 --> 00:37:35,682
You lie.

186
00:37:50,741 --> 00:37:56,706
Blondie you look just terrific.

187
00:37:57,752 --> 00:38:00,723
Alright, how much is there?

188
00:38:02,861 --> 00:38:05,661
Not much, nothing that you cant
whip out in no time

189
00:38:10,707 --> 00:38:16,171
Except they must be individual
done and addressed to

190
00:38:16,249 --> 00:38:20,689
The school super intendent, the
school board, and the athletic dep

191
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:24,696
On the other side do the same for
the art, music and math departments.

192
00:38:27,234 --> 00:38:31,697
You have to be kidding. I am up to
my garter belts already.

193
00:38:31,775 --> 00:38:34,712
Tomorrows graduation day.

194
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,716
I know thats why it has
to be done quick.

195
00:38:36,917 --> 00:38:38,886
I know. Like a bunny.

196
00:38:41,758 --> 00:38:47,723
Blondie. I would appreciate
this very much.

197
00:38:47,802 --> 00:38:51,740
Its very important to me.

198
00:38:52,109 --> 00:38:54,738
Dont try to be nice. Im
really pissed off.

199
00:38:54,813 --> 00:38:58,582
This is just not fair. Ill be
up half the night with this.

200
00:39:01,791 --> 00:39:05,695
What do you say I come by your
place with a bottle of wine

201
00:39:05,764 --> 00:39:09,703
after your finished.

202
00:39:13,745 --> 00:39:17,706
You know Mr. Guglioni you are
a real bastard.

203
00:39:22,759 --> 00:39:24,729
Make it around midnight.

204
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,879
Did you here it?

205
00:41:36,946 --> 00:41:38,882
Hear what?

206
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:42,888
Strange tapping noises everywhere,
you must have heard it?

207
00:41:42,956 --> 00:41:44,891
No I havent heard a thing.

208
00:41:44,959 --> 00:41:46,895
There must be something in the pipes.

209
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:47,895
What do you think it is?

210
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:49,900
I dont know but lm gonna find out.

211
00:41:49,968 --> 00:41:50,900
You do that.

212
00:42:31,937 --> 00:42:37,902
Alright however it is youre
not supposed to be here.

213
00:42:37,981 --> 00:42:41,919
I wont hassle you or anything.

214
00:42:41,987 --> 00:42:43,923
Get your ass out now.

215
00:42:53,973 --> 00:42:57,935
Mr. Roberts. You look a lot
thinner without your clothes on.

216
00:42:58,014 --> 00:43:00,951
Do you find me attractive?

217
00:43:01,019 --> 00:43:04,889
sure I do. Your fine

218
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:09,898
Do you like snakes?
I call this my little cobra.

219
00:43:10,934 --> 00:43:12,903
Why is it poisonous?

220
00:43:13,939 --> 00:43:19,904
Youre very funny. So are you,
youre real funny.

221
00:43:44,022 --> 00:43:46,959
Come back here. Dont think I
dont know who you are because I do.

222
00:43:47,027 --> 00:43:49,964
Come back and show your
face you miserable scum.

223
00:44:02,018 --> 00:44:04,921
You really screwed up this year,
Youll be lucky to graduate.

224
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:11,422
Ill graduate. Doing what?
You hardly went to class

225
00:44:11,501 --> 00:44:16,943
Its cool I talked to Mr. Roberts
he didnt care. Ill graduate.

226
00:44:18,346 --> 00:44:20,941
How many girls have you screwed?
Is it true about the ones at Sacred Heart?

227
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:28,952
You a calculator or something?
No I just wondered.

228
00:44:29,497 --> 00:44:33,960
Every one. Cheerleaders, Softball
girls. Youre kidding

229
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:37,976
You know Nancy? In the back of
a car first time I met her.

230
00:44:38,044 --> 00:44:42,985
So you did do it? Had to
teach her a little bit.

231
00:44:44,188 --> 00:44:55,003
Shes my best friend. What did
she say? About you, nothing at all.

232
00:44:55,072 --> 00:44:59,011
Well she probably didnt say
anything because of her boyfriend.

233
00:45:03,987 --> 00:45:08,950
Im really horny. Theres time
for that later.

234
00:45:09,029 --> 00:45:11,965
I really am. Later.

235
00:45:21,015 --> 00:45:23,986
How you like to get busted
week before grad?

236
00:45:26,524 --> 00:45:28,493
You lack discipline.

237
00:45:35,038 --> 00:45:38,009
Im gonna miss you in the fall McGregor.

238
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:44,519
Narcs are an endangered species.
Theyre not bright.

239
00:45:44,588 --> 00:45:49,528
Instead of flying south they fly up
their own ass and mate with themselves

240
00:45:50,063 --> 00:45:52,032
And what comes out. McGregor!

241
00:46:02,083 --> 00:46:06,989
And if I catch you smoking dope around
campus, you ass is mine.

242
00:48:31,128 --> 00:48:37,093
Are you crazy? These are precision
instruments you could snap a blade.

243
00:48:38,307 --> 00:48:43,111
I didnt touch your machines.
You didnt?

244
00:48:43,315 --> 00:48:48,119
I didnt come here to play games.
Then why did you come?

245
00:48:48,189 --> 00:48:53,130
To point a killer at a finger. Go
ahead, everyone else in town has.

246
00:48:54,667 --> 00:48:57,136
Maybe they know something.
They dont know nothing.

247
00:48:58,173 --> 00:49:02,179
All the years I gave them
winners they loved me.

248
00:49:02,179 --> 00:49:07,587
One accident where a child
gets a blood clot and

249
00:49:07,655 --> 00:49:11,593
its my fault and lm out on my ass.

250
00:49:12,129 --> 00:49:13,757
I say you got off easy.

251
00:49:14,132 --> 00:49:17,763
Listen I didnt kill your sister.
I loved her.

252
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:24,105
Loved you lying bastard you
and your stupid track team.

253
00:49:26,152 --> 00:49:30,113
I didnt kill anyone. I give my
life to Laura and all my kids.

254
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:36,123
I pushed them I yelled at them,
that didnt mean I didnt care.

255
00:49:38,172 --> 00:49:44,137
I spent 4 years with Laura
I molded her I shaped her

256
00:49:48,188 --> 00:49:50,488
She was precision she was power.

257
00:49:53,029 --> 00:49:54,999
Like a machine?

258
00:50:02,211 --> 00:50:06,674
Im sorry I have a lot to
do. Why did you come?

259
00:50:08,221 --> 00:50:12,183
I came for an answer I think I got it

260
00:50:21,744 --> 00:50:23,713
Well meet again Michaels

261
00:50:36,267 --> 00:50:38,237
Yeah I guess we will.

262
00:52:23,311 --> 00:52:26,281
Hey give me my ball.

263
00:55:01,437 --> 00:55:04,340
Listen coach lm really
sorry I really am.

264
00:55:06,378 --> 00:55:10,340
Coach Michaels looks like you
had yourself a pretty good deal.

265
00:55:10,419 --> 00:55:12,854
Surrounded by all that fine young stuff.

266
00:55:15,393 --> 00:55:20,857
You got lipstick on you.
To bad you blew it

267
00:55:24,909 --> 00:55:30,874
Dont treat me like shit coach I
can hurt you bad. If I put my mind to it.

268
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:32,887
You son of a bitch.

269
00:59:13,518 --> 00:59:15,487
whats wrong? Did I do something?

270
00:59:25,538 --> 00:59:27,507
You know its a really nice night.

271
00:59:30,546 --> 00:59:33,016
Must be nice to piss anywhere.

272
00:59:35,554 --> 00:59:37,524
The worlds my toilet

273
01:03:12,712 --> 01:03:15,683
No lm not saying youre wrong.
Im not saying youre right.

274
01:03:25,733 --> 01:03:27,703
Of course she can come to that.
Shell be there at 4 o clock.

275
01:03:31,743 --> 01:03:33,712
Shes not supposed to miss
graduation exercise.

276
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:52,733
Its miss Fisk she is fit to be tied.
Tony has not been home all night.

277
01:03:54,781 --> 01:03:59,744
What does she want? She needs someone
to crab at and lm not important enough.

278
01:04:00,458 --> 01:04:04,021
Why me I dont know where the damn
kid is. Tell her that shes on line 2.

279
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:09,694
Tell here what? If I knew Id
have your job.

280
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:15,203
I dont have the time just tell
her lm not here.

281
01:04:15,716 --> 01:04:21,715
I do lots of things for you Mr.
Guglioni, but lying is not one of them

282
01:04:28,770 --> 01:04:33,733
Hi Ms. Fisk. How are you,
yes I did hear.

283
01:04:33,812 --> 01:04:39,755
Apparently some of the kids didnt
get home last night.

284
01:04:39,822 --> 01:04:45,765
I am and lm not.

285
01:04:45,832 --> 01:04:52,766
There good kids all of them.
All from the same track team.

286
01:04:59,821 --> 01:05:09,726
I certainly would if the were mine.
I certainly will Ms. Fisk.

287
01:05:17,785 --> 01:05:20,254
why are those little bastards
doing this to me.

288
01:05:20,322 --> 01:05:24,762
This is their graduation not mine.
I am calling this all off.

289
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:30,761
I got a thousand people waiting for me.

290
01:05:35,814 --> 01:05:40,823
Mr. Guglionis office hes right here.

291
01:05:40,823 --> 01:05:43,794
I told you I didnt want to
speak to more people.

292
01:05:43,861 --> 01:05:46,798
You tell the truth on your own time.

293
01:05:51,874 --> 01:05:55,812
its Ms. Brentwood, Paulas mother
wants to talk to you.

294
01:06:40,855 --> 01:06:46,819
Im not here Blondie, tell them
jokes tell them lies.

295
01:06:46,897 --> 01:06:50,836
Just tell them to stop bugging me.

296
01:06:55,879 --> 01:07:58,873
Mr. Guglioni? Who let you in?

297
01:07:58,916 --> 01:08:01,887
From now on its fly or fall
on their own.

298
01:08:01,955 --> 01:08:05,324
Their probably just raising hell.

299
01:08:10,870 --> 01:08:14,831
Neither do I. Thats why lm here.

300
01:08:20,886 --> 01:08:22,856
Hey chief. Whats the good word?

301
01:08:25,895 --> 01:08:30,858
Wheres your badge?
I must have lost it.

302
01:08:33,908 --> 01:08:36,879
Heres a list of home rooms,
check em out.

303
01:08:37,914 --> 01:08:41,876
Got you covered. What if
theyre not there?

304
01:08:44,425 --> 01:08:47,395
Then you write in your
report not there.

305
01:08:47,462 --> 01:08:49,398
Should I look for them?

306
01:08:49,466 --> 01:08:51,901
No McGregor were here to make
a report. Thats all.

307
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:54,907
About a bunch of irresponsible
inconsiderate kids,

308
01:08:54,975 --> 01:08:58,414
about to fly out of their nest
and shit all over us.

309
01:08:58,481 --> 01:09:00,916
So make your report and lets go.

310
01:09:00,985 --> 01:09:02,955
I get Closter phobic just being
around schools.

311
01:09:02,955 --> 01:09:04,857
Thats a good one.

312
01:10:30,032 --> 01:10:32,001
Impressive isnt it?

313
01:10:34,038 --> 01:10:37,009
Its too bad about coach Michaels.

314
01:10:37,076 --> 01:10:41,015
Yes it is. It is a pity.
He was a fine coach.

315
01:10:41,083 --> 01:10:43,018
Thats the way it is in public life.

316
01:10:43,086 --> 01:10:46,023
Youre only as good as you last mistake.

317
01:10:46,091 --> 01:10:50,030
Sobering thought isnt it?

318
01:10:50,098 --> 01:10:54,036
How is your report going?
lm working on it.

319
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:37,041
Coach Michaels lm inspector Helliman.

320
01:11:41,082 --> 01:11:44,053
Six seniors didnt make
it home last night.

321
01:11:46,090 --> 01:11:48,059
Do you know anything about it?

322
01:11:49,596 --> 01:11:53,057
You didnt see or hear anything
theres nothing you can tell me?

323
01:11:58,110 --> 01:12:00,079
They were all on your track team.
I have no track team.

324
01:12:02,116 --> 01:12:06,021
In case you hadnt heard lve
been canned. I heard.

325
01:12:09,061 --> 01:12:14,024
If youll excuse me I have
to finish packing.

326
01:12:18,076 --> 01:12:21,047
Ill see you at the graduation ceremony.

327

339
01:17:46,283 --> 01:17:47,717
Who are you whats your
stake in all this?

340
01:18:10,256 --> 01:18:14,217
You dont understand I never
killed anyone. Its all a mistake.

341
01:18:14,295 --> 01:18:19,236
I was there I saw you kill her.

342
01:18:19,304 --> 01:18:22,240
What are you talking about?

343
01:18:22,308 --> 01:18:25,245
You killed Laura you all killed her.

344
01:18:25,313 --> 01:18:29,252
Now you all have to be punished.

345
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:32,588
You killed Sally.

346
01:18:35,297 --> 01:18:43,266
Sally, Ralph, Diane, Paula, Tony, Pete.

347
01:18:50,322 --> 01:18:54,283
All of them thats right.
They all had to punished.

348
01:19:04,278 --> 01:19:10,243
30 seconds thats all it took.
Just 30 seconds.

349
01:19:20,304 --> 01:19:24,266
Come on Laura. You can do it.

350
01:19:24,345 --> 01:19:28,283
Just a little bit more, move your ass.

351
01:19:33,325 --> 01:19:38,289
30 seconds. Then youre dead.

352
01:19:40,337 --> 01:19:44,299
My whole life was changed
in just 30 seconds.

353
01:19:46,347 --> 01:19:54,316
We were gonna be married the
day after graduation day.

354
01:19:58,367 --> 01:20:00,336

355
01:20:25,411 --> 01:20:28,382
Kevin are you alright?

356
01:20:28,450 --> 01:20:33,390
He killed them.
I tried to get him to tell you.

357
01:20:37,431 --> 01:20:39,400
Could you come to the
station and make a statement?

358
01:20:40,436 --> 01:20:41,404
A statement of what?

359
01:20:42,439 --> 01:20:45,410
A record of What happened,
what you saw what he said to you.

360
01:20:45,478 --> 01:20:48,415
Try to make sense of this mess.

361
01:20:49,451 --> 01:20:52,422
Ill go with you. No I dont
want you involved.

362
01:20:55,461 --> 01:20:58,466
Did you ever see anything so awful?

363
01:20:58,466 --> 01:21:03,429
You work with people day
after day week after week.

364
01:21:04,408 --> 01:21:06,378
Month after month, year after year.

365
01:21:06,446 --> 01:21:12,389
Could you get me Lauras trophy I
want it before I leave.

366
01:21:14,425 --> 01:21:20,390
Lauras trophy? Kevin picked it up
today with Lauras diploma.

367
01:21:21,103 --> 01:21:21,900
Are you sure?

368
01:21:22,438 --> 01:21:26,400
This morning he said that you said
you wanted him to have it

369
01:21:30,451 --> 01:21:33,422
Kevins not the type of boy
to lie is he?

370
01:21:36,461 --> 01:21:43,429
No of course not, thank you.

371
01:24:15,557 --> 01:24:18,494
Were getting married after
graduation just like we planned.

372
01:24:21,533 --> 01:24:22,501
I though you loved her?

373
01:24:24,538 --> 01:24:26,507
What kind of sister are you
shes your flesh and blood.

374
01:24:29,546 --> 01:24:34,509
Laura loves peace and quiet.
Dont you sweat heart.

375
01:24:42,568 --> 01:24:44,537
They were so awful to her.

376
01:24:44,605 --> 01:24:47,542
They just stuck her in the
ground like she never existed.

377
01:24:49,579 --> 01:24:52,550
Nobody would talk abut her.
You couldnt mention her name.

378
01:24:53,586 --> 01:24:58,549
But I set them straight now theyre
all dead and gone.

379
01:31:16,817 --> 01:31:19,788
Terrible I dont know what more to say.

380
01:31:20,823 --> 01:31:24,785
Cant you stay longer.

381
01:31:24,863 --> 01:31:27,800
I got to be on that plane
tomorrow morning

382
01:31:28,837 --> 01:31:32,798
Im sorry mom I really am.

383
01:33:18,884 --> 01:33:20,853
They took her from the grave.

384
01:33:24,894 --> 01:33:29,857
What did you come here for?
Never nothing but trouble.

385
01:33:31,905 --> 01:33:34,876
You woke up Anne in the
middle of the night.

386
01:33:35,912 --> 01:33:39,873
Come on, everyone to bed now.

387
01:33:44,927 --> 01:33:47,898
Forgive Ronald hes been
through a lot.

388
01:33:56,946 --> 01:33:58,916
Sleep tight. Dont let the
bed bugs bite.
