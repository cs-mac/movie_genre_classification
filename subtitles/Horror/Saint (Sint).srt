00:17:11,393 --> 00:17:13,914
Now a billionaire oil magnate...

170
00:17:13,954 --> 00:17:15,874
and leader
of his own political party...

171
00:17:15,914 --> 00:17:18,754
Tretiak predicted that the civil
unrest engulfing Russia...

172
00:17:18,794 --> 00:17:22,914
will only worsen, unless
Reformist President Karpov...

173
00:17:22,914 --> 00:17:24,674
can overcome
the heating-oil shortage...

174
00:17:24,715 --> 00:17:38,435
that has already killed
scores of Russians.

175
00:17:38,476 --> 00:17:39,876
WOMAN: What beautiful work.

176
00:17:47,996 --> 00:17:51,76
Ah. Cloisonne.

177
00:17:51,76 --> 00:17:52,196
It is old.

178
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,317
SIMON: [Spanish accent] Yes.
It belonged to my grandmother.

179
00:17:58,117 --> 00:17:59,276
Please.

180
00:18:04,397 --> 00:18:07,797
Tonight I feel like
the oldest person on this plane.

181
00:18:09,157 --> 00:18:12,638
My husband, he's sending me
to England to live...

182
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:15,98
until things change.

183

You are married
not even a year...

00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:20,638
and already this bastard
has a girlfriend?!

185
00:18:21,638 --> 00:18:22,918
I am sorry.

186
00:18:22,918 --> 00:18:24,358
It's not my business.

187
00:18:27,79 --> 00:18:29,999
How come you know
so much about me?

188
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:32,239
It is a gift.

189
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:38,160
I'm Martin de Porres.
I am from Spain...

190
00:18:38,199 --> 00:18:40,40
but I'm named
for a Peruvian saint...

191
00:18:40,79 --> 00:18:43,80
who could cure
the sick or the injured...

192
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,639
by the laying of hands.

193
00:18:56,361 --> 00:18:58,601
INSPECTOR: Hmm.
He's the same build...

194
00:18:58,601 --> 00:19:00,921
as the description
the Russians gave us...

195
00:19:01,461 --> 00:19:03,21
but he doesn't
sound like an Aussie.

196
00:19:03,62 --> 00:19:04,182
WOMAN: No.

197
00:19:07,43 --> 00:19:08,881
WOMAN: Could be faking it.

SECURITY GUARD:
X-rays are clear.

199
00:19:17,363 --> 00:19:19,842
He hasn't swallowed
the microchip. Anything?

200
00:19:20,382 --> 00:19:23,63
SIMON: You English with
your chips, your fish and chips.

201
00:19:22,602 --> 00:19:23,963
On the airplane, I had chicken.

202
00:19:24,03 --> 00:19:26,83
WOMAN: Van Gogh theft,
Netherlands.

203
00:19:26,122 --> 00:19:28,124
Last year. Same eyes.

204
00:19:28,163 --> 00:19:29,844
INSPECTOR: Different chin.

207
00:20:23,907 --> 00:20:26,67
What is your name?!

208
00:20:25,608 --> 00:20:27,48
Answer the question!

209
00:20:29,908 --> 00:20:32,27
[Echoing]
What is your name?! Hey!

210

MAN ON TELEPHONE:
Lou, the microchip arrived.

211
00:20:39,168 --> 00:20:40,288
I put the dough in your account.

212
00:20:40,829 --> 00:20:43,29
SIMON: Sorry I didn't get back
to you about that diamond.

213
00:20:43,69 --> 00:20:44,629
Moscow's like Dodge City now.

214
00:20:44,168 --> 00:20:46,689
All them greedy Commies have
turned into crazy capitalists.

215
00:20:46,728 --> 00:20:48,969
It's disgusting.
It's made 'em sloppy.

216
00:20:49,09 --> 00:20:51,209
One or two more easy scores
like this last one...

-l top 50 mil, I'm quitting.
-l heard that before.

SIMON: Not from me.
I don't know nuttin'.

You don't believe me?
Try and find me.

-Fuck you, Lou.
-See yourself.

SIMON: My name
is Bruno Hautenfaust.

I was named for a saint
who was a very wealthy man.

Had the wine, women, songs...

SIMON: He's not a racecar.
Nobody runs him.

He's an independent contractor.

will mind if I kill him.

Oh, yes.

you request of my employer?

TRETIAK: Do you know
what cold fusion is?

SIMON: Of course.

266
00:24:09,963 --> 00:24:12,83
It's the theory...

267
00:24:11,624 --> 00:24:14,144
of nuclear fusion
at room temperature...

268

SIMON: Klein, Bitte.

SIMON: As far as science goes,
it ranks just above astrology.

Those who claim to
have achieved the experiment...

274

have never been able
to duplicate it.

TRETIAK: Until now.

276
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:35,265
There is an electrochemist
working at Oxford.

277
00:24:35,805 --> 00:24:38,86
We believe
that this good lady...

278
00:24:37,626 --> 00:24:40,426
made a breakthrough
in cold fusion.

279
00:24:40,466 --> 00:24:44,386
Your employer
will obtain the formula for me.

280
00:24:44,425 --> 00:24:48,66
He's very busy,
and you are very boring.

281
00:24:48,106 --> 00:24:49,866
Your offer must inspire him.

282
00:24:49,866 --> 00:24:52,386
This woman
has repeatedly avoided...

283
00:24:52,427 --> 00:24:56,106
my agents' attempts
to find the formula.

284
00:24:56,147 --> 00:24:58,147
She's cagey, difficult.

285
00:25:00,07 --> 00:25:02,208
Maybe your agents are stupid.

286
00:25:06,127 --> 00:25:10,48
I think this inspiration would
cost you three million dollars.

287
00:25:10,87 --> 00:25:12,288
TRETIAK: [Chuckles]
Ridiculous.

288
00:25:11,788 --> 00:25:16,388
SIMON: Why? You will have
the world market in energy.

289
00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:18,787
Cost you a nickel
for every million you make.

290
00:25:18,828 --> 00:25:20,68
His deposit should go--

291
00:25:20,108 --> 00:25:23,148
Hey. It is not for me.

292
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:24,629
It is for mother Russia.

293
00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:28,430
But you want mother Russia,
too, Mr. Tretiak.

294
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:32,69
Three million in a bank account
in Zurich. Agreed?

295
00:25:34,229 --> 00:25:35,789
Yes.

296
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:40,909
How long to get
your employer's agreement?

297
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,109
I'll ask.

298
00:25:56,911 --> 00:25:58,471
Your offer has inspired her.

299
00:25:59,11 --> 00:26:00,91
I'll do it.

300
00:26:01,231 --> 00:26:03,392
Bank account number in Zurich.

301
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:06,152
Auf wiedersehen. Bye, sonny.

302
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:07,912
TRETIAK: Bye-bye.

303
00:26:09,352 --> 00:26:13,473
I really love this guy.
Ha ha ha!

304
00:26:17,11 --> 00:26:19,12
ILYA:
Too bad we have to kill him.

305
00:26:19,52 --> 00:26:20,413
Yeah, too bad.

306
00:26:34,434 --> 00:26:37,154
WOMAN: When the electrochemists
Pons and Fleischman...

307
00:26:37,694 --> 00:26:40,94
announced in 1989...

308
00:26:39,634 --> 00:26:42,714
that they had discovered
cold fusion...

309
00:26:42,754 --> 00:26:46,875
a revolutionary process
of generating energy...

310
00:26:46,914 --> 00:26:50,275
they were at first
acclaimed as geniuses...

311
00:26:50,315 --> 00:26:53,34
and then condemned
as charlatans.

312
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:57,75
The protocols of cold fusion...

313
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,475
SIMON: What are those? Drugs?

314
00:26:59,16 --> 00:27:02,16
Could I have one?
My head's pounding.

315
00:27:02,55 --> 00:27:04,96
She's boring the life
out of me.

316
00:27:05,355 --> 00:27:07,356
-They're for my heart.
-Oh.

317
00:27:08,476 --> 00:27:11,637
You have very pretty eyes.
You're a pretty lady.

318
00:27:11,676 --> 00:27:14,37
-Who are you?
-Me?

319
00:27:14,37 --> 00:27:16,476
I'm here to do an interview
with that Dr. Russell.

320
00:27:17,17 --> 00:27:19,616
I'm gonna expose her as a fraud.

321
00:27:19,157 --> 00:27:21,997
You don't put any stock in
this cold fusion mumbo jumbo?

322
00:27:22,37 --> 00:27:24,78
-Actually, I do.
-Really?

323
00:27:24,117 --> 00:27:27,197
WOMAN: Dr. Emma Russell.

324
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,238
Oops.

325
00:27:40,99 --> 00:27:45,499
EMMA: Well, I didn't prepare
any formal remarks.

326
00:27:45,39 --> 00:27:46,919
I'm actually more interested...

327
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:50,319
in what questions you all have
about cold fusion...

328
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,398
so I thought we would

Please?

MAN: I have, Dr. Russell.

332
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,280
Can you explain
the actual process of fusion...

333
00:28:03,321 --> 00:28:04,880
you know, the theory?

334
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:07,640
Yes. Oh, there it is.

335
00:28:08,181 --> 00:28:12,21
This is the--the apparatus.

336
00:28:12,61 --> 00:28:13,381
And very simply...

337
00:28:12,921 --> 00:28:16,40
when positively charged
deuterons...

338
00:28:16,81 --> 00:28:18,921
are attracted
to the palladium cathode...

339
00:28:18,961 --> 00:28:20,361
they cram together...

340
00:28:20,401 --> 00:28:23,801
and there are millions of them
inside the cathode...

341
00:28:23,842 --> 00:28:27,82
getting closer and closer,
and then they fuse...

342
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,202
and they create energy
in the form of helium.

343
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:30,762
WOMAN: But I read somewhere...

344
00:28:30,802 --> 00:28:32,482
that the experiment
couldn't be replicated...

345
00:28:33,22 --> 00:28:36,663
so how do we know it works?

346
00:28:36,203 --> 00:28:38,283
EMMA: We don't.

347
00:28:38,322 --> 00:28:39,442
Not yet.

348
00:28:41,23 --> 00:28:42,822
But if you remember Einstein...

349
00:28:42,362 --> 00:28:45,363
he knew the theory
of relativity to be true...

350
00:28:45,403 --> 00:28:47,164
long before he could prove it.

351
00:28:47,164 --> 00:28:47,724
I mean, he felt the truth.

352
00:28:47,724 --> 00:28:48,844
And, uh, some of us
feel the same way...

353
00:28:48,844 --> 00:28:52,363
And, uh, some of us
feel the same way...

354
00:28:52,904 --> 00:28:54,63
about cold fusion...

355
00:28:53,604 --> 00:28:55,963
because it's there.
It's in nature...

356
00:28:56,504 --> 00:29:01,64
the raw, natural power
just waiting to be harnessed.

357
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:04,845
When we ignite
that cold fusion fire...

358
00:29:04,884 --> 00:29:07,84
I mean, just imagine.

359
00:29:08,165 --> 00:29:12,46
There's more energy
in one cubic mile of seawater...

360
00:29:12,85 --> 00:29:14,806
than in all the known
oil reserves on earth.

361
00:29:14,845 --> 00:29:18,765
I mean, you could drive
your car 55 million miles...

362
00:29:18,806 --> 00:29:21,165
on a gallon of heavy water.

363
00:29:21,206 --> 00:29:23,966
It would be the end
of pollution...

warmth for the whole world.

365

So why don't I demonstrate
for you...

366
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:35,287
why other people in the past
have been so unsuccessful?

01:22:07,392 --> 01:22:09,993
However, burns will heal.

991
01:22:10,532 --> 01:22:13,92
Maybe a little chance
of scarring, perhaps...

992
01:22:12,633 --> 01:22:15,873
but all in all,
I'd say he's a very lucky boy.

993
01:22:15,873 --> 01:22:18,152
ILYA: Lucky? Look at me.

994
01:22:19,532 --> 01:22:22,93
I am a damn devil.

995
01:22:21,633 --> 01:22:23,113
TRETIAK: Christ.

996
01:22:26,273 --> 01:22:27,353
Yes?

997
01:22:27,393 --> 01:22:30,394
BOTVIN: I have run every test
on this cold fusion formula...

998
01:22:30,433 --> 01:22:34,794
and must conclude
it is not merely incomplete...

999
01:22:34,834 --> 01:22:37,34
but rather...impossible.

1000
01:22:37,75 --> 01:22:40,714
You may as well try to create
perpetual motion.

1001
01:22:41,635 --> 01:22:44,355
I invest millions...

1002
01:22:46,14 --> 01:22:48,855
and you can't make it work!

1003
01:22:51,634 --> 01:22:54,435
What are you doing
with my money?

1004
01:22:56,995 --> 01:23:00,676
Do you think it comes so easy?

1005
01:23:00,717 --> 01:23:01,835
No!

1006
01:23:01,875 --> 01:23:03,835
BOTVIN: But, sir...

1007
01:23:03,876 --> 01:23:08,357
I have been working for
nearly two weeks without sleep.

1008
01:23:08,396 --> 01:23:12,797
At first blush, the theorem
appears quite convincing.

1009
01:23:12,837 --> 01:23:14,316
It does?

1010
01:23:19,96 --> 01:23:23,217
Yes. It does.

1011
01:23:23,438 --> 01:23:24,718
Good man.

1012
01:23:24,758 --> 01:23:27,317
We can use it
to destroy our enemies.

1013
01:23:29,37 --> 01:23:32,398
TRETIAK: Only Dr. Russell
can spoil my plan.

1014
01:23:32,438 --> 01:23:35,119
If she gets back to London
and speaks to the press...

1015
01:23:35,158 --> 01:23:38,838
YURI: From here to the airport
are three army checkpoints...

1016
01:23:38,878 --> 01:23:40,678
all of them loyal to us.

1017
01:23:40,718 --> 01:23:42,719
TRETIAK: Make certain
they get the message--

1018
01:23:43,259 --> 01:23:46,19
she doesn't leave Moscow alive.

1019
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:49,160
Mr. President.

1020
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:52,200
As former Vice-minister
of Energy and Power...

1021
01:23:52,239 --> 01:23:57,319
I hear all manner of schemes
that provide cheaper energy.

1022
01:23:57,360 --> 01:24:00,800
And as our countrymen
freeze to death...

1023
01:24:00,841 --> 01:24:04,160
I've become aware of
a marvelous new technology...

1024
01:24:04,201 --> 01:24:07,41
about which I'm hopelessly
out of my league...

1025
01:24:07,80 --> 01:24:09,721
from a scientific viewpoint.

1026
01:24:09,761 --> 01:24:12,881
That's why I brought
our eminent physicist here...

1027
01:24:12,921 --> 01:24:16,41
Dr. Lev Botvin from
the University of Moscow.

1028
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:19,61
AIDE: Before we are dazzled
by the good news...

1029
01:24:18,602 --> 01:24:21,162
let's dispense with the bad.

1030
01:24:21,201 --> 01:24:23,322
What is the price
of this marvel?

1031
01:24:23,362 --> 01:24:26,81
YURI: The cost of research
and development are there...

1032
01:24:26,121 --> 01:24:29,682
which is all
you are asked to defray.

1033
01:24:35,63 --> 01:24:37,702
Ten billion in hard currency?

1034
01:24:37,242 --> 01:24:42,163
I can't even pay my teachers,
my miners, my doctors.

1035
01:24:49,364 --> 01:24:51,283
Where are you heading?

1036
01:24:51,324 --> 01:24:54,604
I thought we'd drink
some vodka to get warmer.

1037
01:24:58,645 --> 01:25:01,604
Like the miracle of socialism...

1038
01:25:01,644 --> 01:25:04,844
our miracle
of cold fusion failed.

1039
01:25:04,885 --> 01:25:06,04
But no matter.

1040
01:25:06,44 --> 01:25:10,165
We have sold cold fusion
to President Karpov.

1041
01:25:10,206 --> 01:25:13,605
We will use the scandal
of its failure to destroy him.

1042
01:25:13,645 --> 01:25:16,405
The army must be mobilized
by midnight tomorrow.

1043
01:25:16,445 --> 01:25:19,926
You're a man in a hurry.
That's only one day.

1044
01:25:19,966 --> 01:25:23,246
ILYA: Not now, old witch.
We're working.

1045
01:25:23,287 --> 01:25:24,685
TRETIAK: Yes. Think of it.

1046
01:25:24,726 --> 01:25:30,326
One day, you can be proud again
to be a Russian general...

1047
01:25:30,366 --> 01:25:34,327
with a big nuclear missile
where your prick used to be.

1048
01:25:34,367 --> 01:25:37,367
AIDE: You must complete a form
before you get on a flight home.

1049
01:25:37,407 --> 01:25:38,966
Any medical problems?

1050
01:25:39,07 --> 01:25:40,447
EMMA: I have a heart condition.

1051
01:25:40,487 --> 01:25:42,928
AIDE: Do you need me to arrange
any medication for you?

1052
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:46,248
EMMA: Well, I haven't
needed a pill.

1053
01:25:46,768 --> 01:25:47,928
That's strange.

1054
01:25:47,968 --> 01:25:50,07
MARINE: Get a form from
table three down the corridor.

1055
01:25:50,48 --> 01:25:51,488
I'll be back in 10 minutes...

1056
01:25:52,27 --> 01:25:54,148
by your side,
all the way to the airport.

1057
01:25:53,688 --> 01:25:54,808
EMMA: Thank you.

REPORTER: ...Across the street
in central Moscow...

1059
01:25:57,49 --> 01:26:01,489
where a mob attacked several
companies with ties to America.

1060
01:26:02,28 --> 01:26:05,829
Apparently, four U.S. citizens
were injured in the attack.

1061
01:26:05,409 --> 01:26:07,169
I'm told
that all American citizens...

1062
01:26:07,209 --> 01:26:09,729
have been asked to report
to the American embassy...

1063
01:26:09,770 --> 01:26:11,609
for immediate evacuation.

-No, I'm fine.
-May I help you?

Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is August Christopher.

Named after Saint Augustine,
who coined my favorite phrase--

01:26:25,330 --> 01:26:27,771
"Give me chastity
and give me constancy...

1069

"but do not give it yet."

[Protesters chanting in Russian]

1071
01:26:34,291 --> 01:26:37,691
Simon, I'm on the next flight
out of here.

1072
01:26:37,731 --> 01:26:38,892
Are you coming with me?

1073
01:26:38,931 --> 01:26:42,292
No. But they are.

1074
01:26:48,211 --> 01:26:51,692
I'll need you to develop
a sudden fear of flying.

1075
01:26:52,232 --> 01:26:54,33
Find a quiet room.

1076
01:26:54,372 --> 01:26:56,613
Finish the formula
and fax it back to me.

1077
01:26:56,652 --> 01:26:58,333
My number's on the back.

1078
01:26:58,373 --> 01:27:02,13
I don't understand.
Why are you keeping my cards?

1079
01:27:02,53 --> 01:27:03,813
I've got to deal
with the Russians...

1080
01:27:03,852 --> 01:27:05,854
or you'll never be safe.

1081
01:27:06,393 --> 01:27:08,74
Be good at school.

1082
01:27:07,614 --> 01:27:08,733
Wait.

1083

-Don't you trust me, darlin'?
-Trust who?

1084
01:27:15,353 --> 01:27:17,34
SIMON: That hurts, Emma.

1085
01:27:17,74 --> 01:27:19,634
EMMA: I'm serious.
What's your name?

1086
01:27:19,174 --> 01:27:21,854
My name is August Christopher.

1087

Of course I trust you,
August Christopher.

1088

Thomas More.

1091
01:27:32,975 --> 01:27:35,814
After all,
you are my personal saint.

1092
01:27:37,235 --> 01:27:39,76
You have to be a very good...

1093
01:27:38,615 --> 01:27:42,16
and, usually, a very dead person
to become a saint.

1094
01:27:42,556 --> 01:27:46,37
And more importantly,
you have to work three miracles.

1095
01:27:46,77 --> 01:27:48,276
Now, get to work.

1096
01:27:49,36 --> 01:27:50,636

Better hurry. It's leaving.

will depose the president...

01:42:26,399 --> 01:42:29,839
Last night, it became clear
what I have to do this morning.

1306
01:42:29,879 --> 01:42:33,80
I'm going to give
cold fusion to the world.

1307
01:42:33,119 --> 01:42:35,880
It's the only way,
if we're ever together again...

1308
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:39,600
that I'll know it's for you,
and you'll know it's for me.

1309
01:42:40,100 --> 01:42:45,60
If cold fusion is free,
then you and I will be free.

1310
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:47,721
If you think giving away
everything before the world...

1311
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:50,01
preventing us from making
an unimaginable fortune...

1312
01:42:50,41 --> 01:42:53,680
will accomplish anything...
you're absolutely right.

1313
01:42:56,401 --> 01:42:58,282
Simon, what are you doing here?

1314
01:42:58,321 --> 01:43:00,682
There are police.

1315
01:43:00,722 --> 01:43:02,122
They're everywhere.

1316
01:43:02,162 --> 01:43:04,402
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

1317
01:43:04,441 --> 01:43:07,362
-You wore the pin.
-Of course.

1318
01:43:11,163 --> 01:43:12,283
You better go.

1319
01:43:25,643 --> 01:43:26,924
How will I find you?

1320
01:43:26,964 --> 01:43:28,843
[Giggles]

1321
01:43:28,883 --> 01:43:31,603
I'll find you. You found me.

1322
01:43:49,686 --> 01:43:52,165
[Applause]

1323
01:43:57,646 --> 01:44:00,606
Although our next speaker
requires no introduction...

1324
01:44:00,646 --> 01:44:05,05
after last week's
Moscow fireworks...

1325
01:44:05,46 --> 01:44:09,286
please let me welcome
Dr. E.J. Russell.

1326
01:44:09,327 --> 01:44:13,47
SIMON: Excuse me.
Is this seat taken?

1327
01:44:13,87 --> 01:44:15,967
No.

1328
01:44:16,06 --> 01:44:17,727
CHAIRMAN: Dr. Russell?

1329
01:44:26,407 --> 01:44:29,207
You don't believe in all this
cold fusion mumbo jumbo, do you?

1330
01:44:29,207 --> 01:44:30,808
EMMA:
Thank you. Good morning.

1331
01:44:30,848 --> 01:44:32,287
INSPECTOR: No.

1332
01:44:32,328 --> 01:44:36,369
We all know cold fusion
has had a...

1333
01:44:36,408 --> 01:44:39,249
a difficult childhood.

1334
01:44:39,290 --> 01:44:41,809
Those of us in the field
are orphans...

1335
01:44:41,848 --> 01:44:43,728
bastards, at best.

1336
01:44:43,769 --> 01:44:48,690
But difficult childhoods make
the most interesting adults.

1337
01:44:50,130 --> 01:44:52,369
I know most of you thought
that cold fusion...

1338
01:44:52,409 --> 01:44:54,969
SIMON: I'm her biggest fan.

1339
01:44:55,10 --> 01:44:57,730
I think she's a fox.
Look at that.

1340
01:44:57,730 --> 01:44:58,850
EMMA: Even though
some of you may feel...

1341
01:44:58,850 --> 01:45:00,650
EMMA: Even though
some of you may feel...

1342
01:45:00,691 --> 01:45:04,290
that its practical application
is still somewhat speculative...

1343
01:45:04,330 --> 01:45:08,410
I've come here today to share
how that dream is slowly...

1344
01:45:08,951 --> 01:45:10,31
becoming a reality.

1345
01:45:10,71 --> 01:45:13,431
Yes, it may take years
to finally learn...

1346
01:45:12,971 --> 01:45:14,852
SIMON: Look at the time.
Got to go.

1347
01:45:14,892 --> 01:45:18,371
EMMA: ...stabilize its power,
but with your help...

1348
01:45:18,411 --> 01:45:21,292
we can all work towards
making the--the...

1349
01:45:22,412 --> 01:45:26,692
dream of cold fusion
finally come true.

1350
01:45:49,894 --> 01:45:50,974
Quickly!

1351
01:45:51,13 --> 01:45:52,773
We got him!

1352
01:45:52,773 --> 01:45:54,653
Hyah!

1353
01:45:56,293 --> 01:45:58,14
INSPECTOR:
Hands behind your back!

1354
01:45:58,55 --> 01:46:00,55
Got you, you slippery--

1355
01:46:00,94 --> 01:46:01,294
MAN: What's going on?

1356
01:46:07,294 --> 01:46:08,495
Damn!

1357
01:46:15,174 --> 01:46:17,15
REPORTER: Donations totaling
three billion dollars...

1358
01:46:17,556 --> 01:46:19,35
were made today
to the Red Cross....

1359
01:46:19,76 --> 01:46:20,156
the Salvation Army...

1360
01:46:19,696 --> 01:46:21,976
and the United Nations
Children's Fund.

1361
01:46:22,16 --> 01:46:23,656
The funds were wired
from the account...

1362
01:46:23,697 --> 01:46:26,656
of jailed Russian tycoon
Ivan Tretiak.

1363
01:46:27,196 --> 01:46:29,76
In other philanthropic news...

1364
01:46:28,616 --> 01:46:30,856
a nonprofit
research foundation...

1365
01:46:30,897 --> 01:46:34,857
has been established to develop
cold fusion technology...

1366
01:46:34,857 --> 01:46:37,57
funded with
an anonymous donation...

1367
01:46:37,97 --> 01:46:40,977
and to be headed by Russian
physicist Dr. Lev Botvin.

1368
01:46:41,16 --> 01:46:43,338
The E.J. Russell Foundation...

1369
01:46:43,377 --> 01:46:45,257
is charged to develop
inexpensive...

Light a candle.

Lay flowers at the door...

1372
01:46:50,219 --> 01:46:52,897
for those who're left behind...

1373
01:46:52,938 --> 01:46:55,779
and the ones
who've gone before.

1374
01:46:55,858 --> 01:46:57,938
Here it comes now...

1375
01:46:57,979 --> 01:47:01,98
sure as silence follows rain...

1376
01:47:01,139 --> 01:47:03,979
the taste of you upon my lips...

1377
01:47:04,18 --> 01:47:06,299
the fingers in my brain.

1378
01:47:06,839 --> 01:47:09,79
Ever gentle...

1379
01:47:08,619 --> 01:47:12,300
as it kills me where I lay...

1380
01:47:12,340 --> 01:47:14,819
who am I to resist?

1381
01:47:14,899 --> 01:47:17,219
Who are you to fail?

1382
01:47:17,260 --> 01:47:21,181
Got to get you out of my mind...

1383
01:47:22,381 --> 01:47:26,780
but I can't escape
from the feeling...

1384
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:32,81
as I try to leave
the memory behind.

1385
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:38,82
Without you,
what's left to believe in?

1386
01:47:49,223 --> 01:47:51,622
I'm so sorry...

1387
01:47:52,162 --> 01:47:55,42
for the way it had to go.

1388
01:47:55,42 --> 01:47:57,442
Now I feel your presence...

1389
01:47:56,983 --> 01:47:59,704
in a way I could not know...

1390
01:47:59,743 --> 01:48:01,784
and I wonder...

1391
01:48:01,822 --> 01:48:05,263
do you ever feel the same?

1392
01:48:05,303 --> 01:48:07,464
In the spilling darkness...

1393
01:48:08,03 --> 01:48:11,244
do you ever hear my name?

1394
01:48:10,784 --> 01:48:14,664
Got to get you out of my mind...

1395
01:48:15,823 --> 01:48:20,105
but I can't escape
from the feeling...

1396
01:48:20,144 --> 01:48:21,425
as l...

1397
01:48:21,425 --> 01:48:25,106
try to leave
the memory behind.

1398
01:48:26,384 --> 01:48:30,745
Without you,
what's left to believe in?

1399
01:48:38,06 --> 01:48:42,566
Deep in the back
of your mind...

1400
01:48:48,627 --> 01:48:52,906
Deep in the back
of your mind...

1401
01:48:57,68 --> 01:48:59,468
And how could you dare...

1402
01:49:00,08 --> 01:49:03,167
to come so close...

1403
01:49:02,707 --> 01:49:05,908
when you're just a ghost to me?

1404
01:49:08,148 --> 01:49:13,268
And I've got to get you
out of my mind...

1405
01:49:14,428 --> 01:49:18,828
but I can't escape
from the feeling...

1406
01:49:18,909 --> 01:49:20,109
as l...

1407
01:49:20,148 --> 01:49:23,669
try to leave
the memory behind.

1408
01:49:25,69 --> 01:49:29,389
Without you,
what's left to believe in?

1409
01:49:36,70 --> 01:49:40,469
Here in the back of your mind...

[Ballad begins]

CRYSTAL: [Singing]
It's just black-and-white...

1412
01:49:58,272 --> 01:49:59,712
or color.

1413
01:50:03,671 --> 01:50:06,152
Those postcards...

1414
01:50:06,192 --> 01:50:07,873
sent from heaven...

1415

says, "Make the most...

"of never-never."

01:50:17,13 --> 01:50:20,132
Horizon starts right here.

01:50:20,993 --> 01:50:24,833
The future's always near...

01:50:24,872 --> 01:50:25,993
and l...

1420
01:50:28,993 --> 01:50:31,34
I know this time...

1421
01:50:31,73 --> 01:50:33,234
is borrowed.

1422
01:50:33,273 --> 01:50:37,313
I try to remember
and forget my sorrow...

1423

or color.

1426
01:50:49,274 --> 01:50:52,715
Don't want to end in tears.

1427
01:50:57,436 --> 01:51:01,915
I'll leave before
my fears are found.

1428
01:51:02,455 --> 01:51:05,96
Scared to love...

1429

these four walls...

1432
01:51:14,76 --> 01:51:16,157
are lost forever.

1433
01:51:16,197 --> 01:51:18,237
I will never...

1434
01:51:18,277 --> 01:51:20,438
be that clever.
