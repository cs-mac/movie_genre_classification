Former New York socialite
Judith Case and John Raymond

3
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,402
<i>are joined by Satan in unholy wedlock
before a live altar, a nude red head.</i>

4
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,961
<i>Self-ordained sorcerer,
Minister Anton LaVey</i>

5
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,288
<i>presided at
the San Francisco ceremony.</i>

6
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,130
<i>As the worst man looks on,</i>

7
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,721
<i>the blessings of Lucifer
and Beelzebub are invoked.</i>

8
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,804
The elaborate rites smacked
<i>of</i> publicity because next day,

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,810
<i>the bride and groom secured
a conventional wedding license.</i>

10
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,322
Two days in LA to go on
my dark tour. David has to handle it.

11
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,010
Two days!

12
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,764
Cannot believe I agreed
to this shit.

13
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,809
Chlo, you wanna hit off this J?

14
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,080
No, I'm good, thanks.

15
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,049
Hey, will you open
a fucking window?

16
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,768
LA, spread your legs.

17
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,443
So tired, I can barely get high.

18
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,130
Too dark.

19
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,408
Keeps burning
through that memory, Chlo.

20
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,560
You guys are like
a fucking Apple commercial.

21
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,845
Devil face.

22
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,888
Oh, my God, that was so KISS.

23
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,416
Knights In Satan's Service.

24
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,896
KISS worshiped pussy, not Satan.

25
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,127
- Hey, don't we all?
- I hate that word.

26
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,044
What? Seth said it, not me.

27
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,009
Hit him anyway, Chlo, they love it.

28
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,044
<i>Where the fuck are we?</i>

29
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,929
Good evening, Los Angeles.

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,202
<i>And</i> we <i>are officially lost.</i>

31
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,761
Damn it.

32
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,684
The arrow shows Flower.
Is this Flower?

33
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,649
No, this is Santa Fe.

34
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,404
Hey, should we get back
on the highway?

35
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,085
Are you sure you had the GPS on?

36
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,526
I don't know, do I?

37
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,448
Nope, 'cause I'm an idiot.

38
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,127
Ah... ha-ha, there she is.
Welcome back, Kim.

39
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,645
I'm sorry, you call her Kim?

40
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,040
Don't ask.

41
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,408
Okay, hello to you, too.

42
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,331
Junkies and whores.

43
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,403
Welcome to La La Land, darling.

44
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,886
Right, there it is.
Let's get the hell out of here.

45
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,801
Yes.

46
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,445
Elise Stevens.

47
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,291
Two nights, right?

48
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,364
Yeah, and specifically
requested room 204.

49
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,884
Laney Gore bled on the floor in 204.

50
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,124
- That's the shit, bro.
- So the shit.

51
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,241
Who the hell's Laney Gore?

52
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,169
One of many surprises
we have in store.

53
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,570
!' Play nice.

54
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,850
I am playing nice.

55
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,929
Laney!

56
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,602
- Oh, my God.
- Wow.

57
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,885
- Smell that asbestos.
- Oh, wow.

58
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,202
Nice. What a shit hole.

59
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,044
Oh, my God. Look at this.

60
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,604
Seth, I think
this is where it happened.

61
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,680
- Matches the photograph, right?
- Yeah.

62
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,326
Hey, this isn't a suite,
it's a dump.

63
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,970
Why did we pay an extra 20?

64
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,048
Room 204.
Laney Gore slit her throat here.

65
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,690
- What?
- Yep.

66
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,526
1972. One of the early sisters
of LaVey's Church of Satan.

67
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,689
Check out the bloodstains
like wet paint.

68
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,091
Oh, my God. It is the same.
David, look.

69
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,163
Yeah. Fucking awesome.

70
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,008
Hey, why are we here
and not Coachella?

71
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,243
Because Chloe's my best friend
and you're on her leash. Okay?

72
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,529
- And you're on mine, bitch.
- You wish, bitch.

73
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,168
Hey, you guys
really want to stay here?

74
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,290
- Yeah.
- Darling, this is why we came.

75
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,481
Right?

76
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,130
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

77
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,680
David, are you okay with this?

78
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,011
- He can't hear you.
- He's sleeping.

79
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,440
Get <i>back</i> here!

80
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,526
Oh, my savior.

81
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,006
Nice neighbors we have.

82
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,856
Yeah, this place
is a squatter's paradise.

83
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,166
You get a needle at check-in.

84
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,364
Anything?

85
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,320
I thought I felt something
a while ago, but...

86
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,056
Yeah. Well, maybe that
was just Milton Bradley

87
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,560
- pocketing your 20 bucks.
- I felt something.

88
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,841
- I swear to God.
- Ask it something.

89
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,201
Hello.

90
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,361
Who are you?

91
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,131
Are you Laney Gore?

92
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,721
What do you decree?

93
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,451
"What do you decree?"

94
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,761
<i>Hey.</i>

95
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,489
Oh, my God, Seth,
you're totally doing that.

96
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,721
I'm not.

97
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,647
What do you want? What do you want?
What do you want?

98
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,361
"B"

99
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,481
"BJ."

100
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,496
Oh, my God, it's like
we're thinking the same thing!

101
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,921
Seth! You little fucking prick!

102
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,401
Fucking goth troll.

103
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,449
- Yeah, my goth troll.
- Bullshit.

104
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,329
Come on, it's cool.

105
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,245
It's not cool,
nobody's taking this seriously!

106
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,562
Okay. Sorry, your bullshit
Satanic tourism,

107
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,445
- I have to take this seriously?
- It's not Satanic tourism,

108
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,768
it's about understanding
the dark natures.

109
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,008
Wow, that's very
Aleister Crowley of you.

110
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,296
You know what? Fuck you, David.

111
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,816
If you didn't wanna do this,
why'd you come?

112
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,841
To get a BJ.

113
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,256
Hey, I've got that
department covered.

114
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,281
Oh, do you?

115
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,896
If you guys are gonna
shit around all weekend,

116
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,296
maybe we should just
blow this whole thing off

117
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,687
and go to Coachella.
This isn't bullshit for me, okay?

118
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,496
I mean, would it kill you, David,

119
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,887
to open your fucking mind
and be a free spirit?

120
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,725
I swear to God, I can't deal
with this frat-boy shit!

121
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,646
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Tension release.

122
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,010
We'll have our coffee.
And from now on they'll behave.

123
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,087
Come on, it's Spring Break.

124
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,529
Come on, LA for two nights,
and then Coachella, right?

125
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,127
Look, we're on board.
Our minds are open.

126
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,201
Yeah?

127
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,321
So... you tell me. What's the plan?

128
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,926
All righty.

129
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,616
- Everybody get together.
- Mm-hm.

130
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,687
- Come on!
- Ow!

131
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,841
- Cheer up!
- Yeah.

132
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,731
- 'Kay? This is where Satan lives.
- Okay. This is happening.

133
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,486
Oh... Cute.
Check out the cross, it's kick-ass.

134
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,486
It's cool.

135
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,971
Oh, my God.

136
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,526
We love your look.

137
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,601
They're friendly.

138
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,121
Hey!

139
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,896
Uh... Dude, uh, we're trying
to find the Sharon Tate house...

140
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,921
Fuck off.

141
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,963
Yeah, well, fuck you, too!

142
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,650
Colossal waste of time, take two.

143
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,768
Sick. I'm gonna use this
as my screen saver.

144
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,445
Color-tone the shit out of it.

145
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,360
Hey, did we ever find out
where her house is?

146
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,285
Go suck cock, bitch.

147
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,726
David, no.

148
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,202
Yeah, go suck
the devil's cock, bitch!

149
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,648
Oh, my God. Good one, Dave.

150
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,724
- Fucker loogied all over my window.
- Welcome to LA.

151
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,970
- No shit!
- This city sucks.

152
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,602
All right. First ones here.

153
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,726
Only ones here.

154
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,056
Sorry, why are we not at a
taping of Two and A Half <i>Men?</i>

155
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,526
Chloe, can you keep his negative
energy away from me, please?

156
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,206
And, David, that shitty show's
been canceled.

157
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,483
Just like the photos.
Insanely awesome.

158
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,881
Oh, my God. Were people
really murdered here?

159
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,600
Bloody and cold.

160
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,880
Seth, we got to find a way
around the back.

161
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,121
Yeah.

162
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,800
Can you get the hell
out of the way?

163
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,401
Dick.

164
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,920
Wow, Dave,
you're just an asshole magnet.

165
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,849
Yeah, no shit. I'm here with you.

166
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,000
Oh, my God. Dave, do you ever
get tired of being wrong?

167
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,496
Oh, you gotta be

168
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,329
- fucking kidding me.
- Mm-hmm.

169
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,164
All right. Yeah.

170
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,561
They came this way about ten PM,

171
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,809
up the hill, to the backyard.

172
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,931
Big-ass hill. Jesus,
what were they? Sherpas?

173
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,241
Why'd they do it?

174
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,536
Manson thought some record
producer that fucked him over

175
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,006
was still living here.
He was actually the target.

176
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,810
Wrong place, wrong time, eh?

177
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,724
On steroids.
Slit her stomach open.

178
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,723
- She was fuckin' pregnant.
- Seth!

179
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,244
Oh, my God, it's so pretty.

180
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,131
I know,
that's what makes it so creepy.

181
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,240
Seth, get a picture of us.

182
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,566
Chloe!

183
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,406
- I don't want to.
- Chloe.

184
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,370
No. Fine.

185
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,411
- Say "Charlie."
- Charlie.

186
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,649
Yep. Totally worth it.

187
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,161
1641 Cahuenga.

188
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,006
Okay.
So, now we're touring porn shops.

189
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,961
Nah, dick,
they just don't advertise.

190
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,490
Call me a dick again, Seth...

191
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,488
Dude. Dave.
You gotta chill, bro.

192
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,730
He's right. You need to chill.

193
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,167
Chlo, do you know how much shit
we're missing right now?

194
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,441
It's almost over.

195
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,364
I'm just saying.
She's your cousin. Okay?

196
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,682
I barely tolerate her
and I don't like Seth.

197
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,001
- David.
- Seriously.

198
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,611
They don't even offer gas money.

199
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,491
Oh, my God, will you guys
fucking grow a pair?

200
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,523
Seriously. Hell, fuck.

201
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,929
Oh, I have a pair, Morticia.

202
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,686
Big pair.

203
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,682
Blow my fucking mind.

204
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,048
Oh, how spine-tingly awesome.

205
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,330
Seth, check it out.

206
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,808
Mmm... incantations.

207
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,847
Check it out.
How wet are you right now?

208
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,486
Oh.

209
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,360
That's rad.

210
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,521
Boo!

211
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,770
- A bad hand-job.
- Good one, Dave.

212
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,888
- Is it real?
- It's mummified.

213
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,201
Taken from the body
of a convicted child murderer.

214
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,084
Killed a ten year-old girl
back in Modesto in '85.

215
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,001
Satanic Panic.

216
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,408
Cases like this all over
Southern Cali, right?

217
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,766
The Panic was a myth.

218
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,287
This asshole was a killer
and a pedophile.

219
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,649
Satan had nothing to do with it.

220
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,323
Yet, here he is,
on display in your shop.

221
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,450
- Yo, how much?
- Not for sale.

222
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,681
What about this?

223
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,289
- You know Coptic Greek?
- I can read.

224
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,324
You need the accent
for the incantations.

225
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,446
It wouldn't work for you.

226
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,451
Asshole.

227
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,136
Well, I guess you're not
ready for the Dark Embrace.

228
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,366
You see his tattoo?

229
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,126
Yeah, upside down cross.
Very original.

230
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,121
Out.

231
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,448
Yeah, yeah. It's cool.

232
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,682
- Now, fucker!
- Or what?

233
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,562
Are you gonna
spill some pig's blood on me?

234
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,563
No, just cut your fucking heart out.

235
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,567
Hey... Place is horseshit.
All right. Let's go.

236
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,841
Poser dick fucks. Shop sucks.

237
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,696
Well, that went splendidly.

238
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,080
I'm gonna burn this place on Yelp.

239
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,680
Enough of this shit.
We're doing the Starline Tour.

240
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,841
Dave at the wheel.

241
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,809
- I hate your van, Dave.
- It hates you.

242
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,616
I'm serious, <i>it</i> was like a shrine.

243
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,563
It had goats' eyes
and dried intestines.

244
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,696
Oh, my God. Are we still
in that little Satan shop?

245
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,760
It's a sacrificial circle.

246
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,531
They give gifts to Lucifer,
in turn, he grants power.

247
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,002
Wow. Goat eyes and pig balls.
The gifts that keep on giving.

248
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,891
We should head back there.

249
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,851
Follow him and see where he goes.

250
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,530
Probably back to his mom's basement.

251
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,080
Seth's right. We should follow him.

252
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,811
- What, are you serious?
- Come on, it'll be fun.

253
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,645
I guarantee
it'll lead somewhere dark.

254
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,371
You can't just tail someone
for fun. There are laws.

255
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,090
Yeah, talk to Google about that.

256
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,720
Nancy Drew did it all the time,
nobody gave her shit.

257
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,564
I'd say we're more like
that Scooby gang

258
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,091
with this piece-of-shit van.

259
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,210
Dude, I paid 1,200 cash with
140,000 miles in that engine,

260
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,284
- and it kicks your fucking goth ass.
- Such a piece of shit.

261
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,761
Insult that van one more time,
we will have serious words.

262
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,480
Maybe we should just check out
and head to Coachella.

263
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,285
Oh, Chlo, stop being a bitch.

264
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,489
She's not a bitch... she's lame.

265
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,406
Hey, that asshole had a blade on him,
who knows what those people are into.

266
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,160
I thought he lives
in his mom's basement?

267
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,009
It doesn't mean he's not a wacko.

268
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,920
Hey, Chloe, come on.
The guy's a total puss.

269
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,536
Oh, with a devil shrine
in the back room?

270
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,245
Yeah, well, one devil shrine
does not a douchebag make.

271
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,656
Honestly, these people probably
circle-jerk to Marilyn Manson

272
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,286
- and call it a day.
- Okay, let's put it to a vote.

273
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,136
Who wants to follow numbnuts
to his little tree fort

274
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,161
of demonic possession?

275
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,131
Yeah!

276
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,361
- David.
- What?

277
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,928
Babe, I'm sorry, I love you,
but I need a little excitement.

278
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,084
Chloe, you're out-voted.
Terribly sorry.

279
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,482
Yay, we're going spying!

280
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,521
Yes!

281
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,842
Hey, if you don't wanna go,
we won't go.

282
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,569
David's right, you owe gas money.

283
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,802
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

284
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,365
Yo, here.

285
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,321
Thank you.

286
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,810
Fucking peer pressure.

287
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,806
Come here, darling.

288
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,881
Tongue!

289
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,326
Use your tongue.

290
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,761
Tongue!

291
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,401
David. David.

292
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,600
They're heading out.
Hey, guys, they're heading out.

293
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,725
Oh, that fuckin'
bald-headed piece of shit.

294
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,004
Fucking bald motherfucker.

295
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,200
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, he's gonna
get away! Come on.

296
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,520
Yeah, the hell they are.

297
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,000
Go, go, go, yo, yo, yo!

298
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,576
- Hey, don't lose him.
- Floor it, Dave!

299
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,967
Floor it, Dave!
He just ran the red.

300
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,089
Hold on, I'm blowin' through it.

301
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,643
Yeah! No fear! No fear!

302
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,600
Yeah, that's right, bitch,
I know how to tail.

303
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,485
They're in the right.
Right, right, right.

304
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,976
- Turning right.
- I see him, grommet.

305
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,411
Seth, he sees him.

306
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,169
I think they're headed
towards the coast.

307
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,256
Yep, that is exactly
where they're going.

308
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,884
Dave, I find myself apologizing.

309
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,565
This van actually does kick my ass.

310
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,416
Dude, it's a stealth fucking fighter.

311
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,976
God, I'm loving their black tint.

312
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,047
Maybe they're vampires.

313
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,240
Ha! No shit, right?

314
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,040
- How much fun is this?
- Yes!

315
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,322
Hey, yo, not to spoil
the moment or anything,

316
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,000
but does anyone know what the fuck
we're gonna do once we stop?

317
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,736
That's what makes it
so much fun, Dave.

318
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,366
- No idea.
- Okay.

319
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,160
Yo.

320
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,571
Dude, don't let them get away.

321
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,000
- I got 'em. I got 'em.
- I think we're in Malibu.

322
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,531
Posh Satanists.

323
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,840
Yeah. They probably
have a fuckin' reality show.

324
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,721
This is exciting.
I'm, like, gonna pee.

325
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,641
Okay.
Now this feels <i>like</i> trespassing.

326
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,205
<i>Let's go back.</i>

327
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,096
David! David, kill the
headlights, they're gonna spot us.

328
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,640
Fuck you, man. I can't see shit.

329
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,176
No, he's right. They'll spot us.

330
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,201
Damn it.

331
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,696
- Fuck, it's dark.
- Oh, shit.

332
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,767
Oh, fuck.

333
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,726
- Damn, it's dark.
- Fuck.

334
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,456
You know,
I'm gonna drive us off this cliff,

335
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,481
I swear to Christ.

336
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,130
You're doing a good job, babe.

337
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,405
Oh. Check out this house.

338
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,008
Of course it's a shit hole.

339
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,002
- Pull over.
- All right, all right.

340
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,447
- They will see us.
- No, we're too far away.

341
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,086
All right, from here we walk.

342
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,049
Seth, there's a flashlight
on the floor.

343
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,041
Got it.

344
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,805
Shh, quiet.

345
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,884
Seth!

346
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,887
Hey!
I feel like we're trespassing.

347
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,161
This is wrong, guys.

348
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,890
Stop being a buzz kill.

349
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,448
Yeah. Hey, we'll just take
a little peek

350
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,601
and then we'll head out.

351
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,442
I mean, come on, you can't
tell me you're not curious.

352
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,364
- Shit.
- Are you okay?

353
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,801
Are you okay?

354
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,089
I ripped my fucking
stockings! Cow shit...

355
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,726
It's not funny, dickhead.

356
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,936
- It's a little funny.
- Elise, it's hot.

357
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,160
- Really?
- Yeah.

358
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,976
- Take you down right here.
- Piss off.

359
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,844
Shh! Get down, fucktards.

360
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,216
We should get a little closer.

361
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,765
Is that the cumball from the shop?

362
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,002
Yeah, that's cumball, all right.

363
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,608
- He had a knife on him.
- My God, I told you.

364
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,966
- We should get closer.
- No.

365
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,200
- Yeah.
- Come on. Come on.

366
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,641
- Let's do it. Let's go.
- All right. All right.

367
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,168
Oh, my God.
What are they playing?

368
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,483
Satanic rage.

369
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,160
Oh, my God.

370
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,604
Hey, Satan's children,
are you doing ecstasy?

371
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,924
- Must be a rave.
- Satanic ecstasy.

372
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,201
Can you see in there?

373
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,971
David, I can't see shit.

374
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,849
- Let's go in the back.
- Yeah.

375
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,280
- David!
- All right, all right.

376
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,960
Shit.

377
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,646
Robes. They're wearing fucking robes.

378
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,968
Shh!

379
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,369
Just when it couldn't get
any more pathetic.

380
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,128
Ladies and gentlemen,
the world's worst Latin class.

381
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,768
No shit, right, what the hell
are they doing?

382
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,616
They're summoning
the spirit world.

383
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,244
You see the elemental signs
on the wall?

384
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,523
Are they written in blood?

385
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,081
- Magic marker.
- Good one, Dave.

386
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,730
I have my moments.

387
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,291
Oh, nice.

388
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,090
- Very nice.
- Seriously?

389
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,923
Hey, that's the freak
from the back room.

390
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,456
And probably the leader, right?

391
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,527
Yeah.

392
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,045
Oh... shit!

393
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,127
Boobs. We have boobies!

394
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,330
Okay. Now I'm starting
to understand the dark powers.

395
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,811
- Seriously?
- Sorry.

396
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,080
Oh, my God. David.

397
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,886
- Elise, what are they doing?
- I don't know.

398
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,849
- David.
- What the hell?

399
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,600
My God, David,
they're gonna cut her!

400
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,041
- We have to do something!
- Hey, Chlo, it's cool.

401
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,441
No!

402
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,965
Hey!

403
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,720
Hey, leave her the fuck alone!

404
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,928
- Shit! Go, go, go.
- He's got a gun!

405
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,329
Go, go!

406
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,891
That's it, a fuckin' gun!

407
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,087
Go, go!

408
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,561
Shit, they're shooting
at us! Run! Run, run, run!

409
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,165
Chloe, hurry up. Come on, run!

410
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,571
- Come on, come on.
- Shit!

411
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,965
Get in! Get in!

412
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,166
Go, go, go!

413
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,370
Did they follow us?

414
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,530
No. I think we're okay.

415
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,164
Jesus Christ!
What the hell was that?

416
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,120
Grommet,
tell me you got that on video.

417
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,967
Oh, fuck.

418
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,924
Fuck! Fuck, I dropped my phone
back there.

419
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,445
I dropped my fucking phone!

420
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,160
- Dave, we gotta go back.
- The hell we do.

421
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,736
Yeah, dude.
You'll get another one.

422
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,683
Yo, yo, there's some
serious viral on that shit.

423
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,444
They tried to shoot us.

424
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,170
Yeah. Well, we were trespassing.

425
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,976
Are you really
taking their side right now?

426
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,002
No, asshole,
I'm just pointing out the obvious.

427
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,616
If anything, they'll find
your fuckin' phone

428
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,687
and report us to the cops.

429
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,531
Good, we can tell the cops about
their sacrificial massacre.

430
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,651
Okay, you guys.
Did anybody see them cut her?

431
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,087
- No, but they were going to.
- How do we know that?

432
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,576
The whole thing
could have been for shits.

433
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,726
David, the girl was scared.

434
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,776
I'm not saying that she wasn't.
I'm just pointing out

435
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,962
the fact that we don't know
the whole story.

436
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,525
God.

437
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,525
Shit.

438
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,801
Elise.

439
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,530
Elise, your phone.

440
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,682
- Hello?
- Elise?

441
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,611
No. Who's this?

442
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,050
<i>My name's Alice.
I think I found your phone.</i>

443
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,971
That's her there, right?

444
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,006
Yup.

445
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,921
Morning.

446
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,491
You okay?

447
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,124
There's no one else here.

448
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,761
Just me.

449
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,525
How'd you know to call us?

450
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,364
Elise was the last call.

451
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,606
Is that you?

452
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,441
That's me.

453
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,731
Do you live around here?

454
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,685
- I got it before they did.
- Oh. Cool.

455
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,764
If you want a reward,
I can give you...

456
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,251
I want the magic word.

457
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,400
Please.

458
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,287
And video's intact. Thank you.

459
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,287
Um... I'm surprised
you didn't delete it.

460
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,611
It wasn't my concern.

461
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,249
So what the fuck was this last night?

462
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,129
Seth, shut up! God.

463
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,326
- We were all there.
- You shouldn't have been.

464
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,404
Fair enough.
But it's good we were, right?

465
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,962
Because whatever
fuckin' virginal sacrifice...

466
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,010
- It wasn't a sacrifice.
- Then what was it?

467
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,685
You wouldn't understand.

468
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,646
Try me.

469
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,084
It was an excommunication.

470
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,566
They were kicking you out?

471
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,966
Why?

472
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,090
Because I wouldn't do
what they wanted.

473
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,281
See ya.

474
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,284
Wait, Alice.
Do you need any money?

475
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,080
- 'Cause I can...
- No! No, no. It's fine.

476
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,880
Well, do you need
a ride anywhere, 'cause...

477
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,001
Chloe.

478
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,968
- I already asked her that.
- It's okay. I'm leaving tomorrow.

479
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,326
Where?

480
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,924
Bakersfield, maybe.

481
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,800
You sure you don't need anything?

482
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,361
Yeah. I'm fine.

483
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,730
Who knew Satanists liked
iced cafe mochas?

484
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,410
She never said she was a Satanist.

485
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,325
- No, just a groupie.
- I'm so curious now.

486
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,768
What do you think
they wanted her to do?

487
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,571
She's barely legal with no home.
Do the math.

488
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,807
She did have nice titties.

489
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,486
She's all ratchet. Okay?
Girlfriend needs to get a bra.

490
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,927
You guys are just
so fucking nice, aren't you?

491
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,765
She's just a kid,
probably some homeless runaway.

492
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,320
Chlo, we all have our issues.

493
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,731
Oh, fuck you, Seth.

494
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,884
She was cool enough to call and
give your fucking phone back.

495
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,451
She didn't even want money.

496
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,560
Yeah, what she wanted
was a place to crash.

497
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,016
You could read it all over her face.

498
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,041
Well, so?

499
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,368
Would it have been so bad
to help her out?

500
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,760
Chloe, for all we know,

501
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,889
she could've been
some little crackhead.

502
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,480
Wow!

503
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,005
For so-called "free spirits",

504
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,924
you guys come up
really fucking short.

505
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,411
Whatever that was.

506
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,528
Chloe.

507
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,566
I'm sorry. I'm a total bitch.

508
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,051
Megabitch.

509
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,609
Yo, there she is.

510
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,727
David, look,
she has nowhere to go.

511
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,211
What?
She's waiting for the bus.

512
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,050
She's so not waiting for the bus.

513
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,400
She said she's heading out
tomorrow, and so are we.

514
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,930
It's one night.

515
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,730
The place is a shithole.

516
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,530
Could she really
fuck it up any more?

517
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,730
Guess we could at least offer.

518
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,486
All because you goth snobs

519
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,160
didn't want to see
Two and a Half Men.

520
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,925
Will you drop it, please?

521
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,967
- Come here, baby.
- Uh-uh.

522
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,648
Alice. Hey.

523
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,930
This is Laney Gore's room.

524
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,840
Yeah.

525
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,211
- What, Laney got naked.
- So fucking full of shit.

526
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,050
No. Laney was totally naked.

527
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,526
No.

528
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,609
She was still in her underwear.

529
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,650
There was blood all over the walls.

530
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,966
Right there.

531
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,082
She tried to make a star
with the blood.

532
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,330
- Why?
- She needed a door.

533
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,244
Took a razor and started slicing
through her skin.

534
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,646
Wait. I thought she slit her throat.

535
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,129
That's what most people think.

536
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,722
The truth is,
is that she cut her wrists.

537
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,564
Took her almost five minutes,

538
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,569
and then she tried
to bathe in her own blood.

539
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,804
- Why'd she do that?
- She wanted to be worthy.

540
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,211
- She wanted to be welcomed.
- Into hell?

541
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,324
Didn't know it was so hard to get in.

542
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,370
Hell isn't a place.

543
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,927
It's a beautiful confusion.

544
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,604
And there's pain.

545
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,760
Okay, uh...

546
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,526
No offense,
but you kinda weren't there.

547
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,603
So... how do you know

548
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,760
it took her five minutes
to cut through her wrists?

549
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,451
Jesus.

550
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,844
This is from back when I was 13.

551
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,044
- I was in a bad place.
- A lot of us were.

552
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,931
- Are you Satanic?
- Seth. Jesus fucking Christ.

553
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,043
I don't believe in organizations.

554
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,722
I believe in finding my own path.

555
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,490
That's not what LaVey believed.

556
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,041
LaVey was a fraud.

557
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,566
Most of them are.

558
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,167
I believe in the power
and reward granted unto Him.

559
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,484
Power not of this Earth.

560
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,606
Just like you.

561
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,569
There's a difference.
I believe in the one, true God.

562
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,886
So do I.

563
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,288
I... didn't mean
to bring down the party.

564
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,163
No. It's okay. Sucks anyway.

565
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,136
This is what happens
when we let Seth buy the beer.

566
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,367
Yo, El Brazo, God boy.

567
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,566
Aw, dude.

568
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,644
Now it's a party!
Now it's a party!

569
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,406
Wet t-shirt,
taking it back to '87!

570
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,011
To Laney Gore.

571
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,286
Laney Gore.

572
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,726
And now we chug!

573
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,965
I don't like this.

What the fuck?

589
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,480

00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,841
I can feel her.

597
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,086
I feel Laney.

598
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,206
We tried to summon her.

599
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,841
- We used this.
- She's beyond that.

600
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,406
We can reach her.

601
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,800
I can show you how.

602
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,606
What do you mean?

603
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,285
She means she can summon. Right?

604
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,770
I can do a lot of things.

605
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,522
I just need willing others
to help me.

606
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,361
We're willing.

607
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,450
- No, we're not.
- Chlo, come on.

608
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,450
Don't you want to know
where she went?

609
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,406
- She's dead.
- There's no death.

610
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,564
Just transition. I can show you.

611
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,081
Take my hand.

612
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,966
No. This we don't record.

613
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,680
All are welcome.

614
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,009
Laney wants to show us something.

615
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,325
Something beautiful.

616
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,371
Chloe.

617
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,647
And these four be here with me.

618
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,485
And now we travel
from flame to flame.

619
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,806
I see it.

620
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,526
I want to share.

621
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,128
No, they are not like the others.

622
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,765
They're of the humble.

623
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,681
They want to.

624
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,760
- Oh. Hey!
- Shit.

625
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,487
What the...

626
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,122
- Yo, what are you doing?
- David, shut up.

627
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,360
Don't tell me to shut up,
she's fuckin' up the walls.

628
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,726
Awesome.

629
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,931
- Alice, are you okay?
- She's drunk.

630
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:55,762
- Oh, shit.
- Oh! Oh, shit!

631
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,571
- Chloe, she's just drunk.
- She only had one beer, Dave.

632
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,080
Can you please get her some water?

633
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,444
- Hey"
- Alice: Don't you see?

634
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,370
She found the door.

635
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,126
Laney's with him.

636
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,920
All are welcome.

637
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,091
Oh, my God.

638
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,851
It's beautiful.

639
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,446
Whoa! Hey!

640
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,606
It's beautiful.

641
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,851
Oh, my God. David.

642
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,570
- Oh, fuck.
- Fuck.

643
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,406
It's okay.

644
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,965
We all made the choice.

645
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,604
We're joined now in the circle.

646
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,969
Yeah, the fuck we did. Out.

647
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,404
Don't you see? He wants us.

648
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,247
Just like Laney.

649
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,120
We'll all be summoned.

650
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,367
And I'm the first.

651
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,809
I'll guide us through the darkness.

652
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,441
Through the labyrinth.

653
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,091
Alice, you need to leave.

654
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,400
I know.

655
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,805
I'll see you soon.

656
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,764
Yeah. Yeah, no, I...
I really appreciate that, Jay.

657
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,648
No, no, no. We just, uh...
we just got off to a late start.

658
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,847
Be an extra day.

659
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,445
Yeah. Yeah.

660
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,046
Okay.

661
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,042
Yeah, no, it's perfect.
It's perfect.

662
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,601
All right, cool.

663
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,800
We should have never
brought her in, I swear to God.

664
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,616
They said if all checks out,
we'll be cleared in two days.

665
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,136
I don't wanna wait two days.
We should have never picked her up.

666
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,161
We should have never...

667
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,120
All right, Elise,
you made your fucking point!

668
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,844
All right, I talked to my cousin.

669
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,920
We can crash at his place
in the Palisades.

670
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,166
There's a key under the mat.

671
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,127
- Where's the Palisades?
- The fuck if I know.

672
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,406
I want to leave.

673
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,210
Elise, we don't have a choice
right now.

674
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,402
- Says who?
- Says the LAPD.

675
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:18,045
All right? It's either the
Palisades or the Scooby van.

676
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,001
Um...

677
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,011
Where's the bathroom?

678
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,528
It's, uh, last door on the left.

679
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,009
Elise.

680
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,205
Oh, God.

681
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,320
How long you really think
we'll be here?

682
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,131
Who the hell knows?

683
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,016
I mean, they still have to
interview everyone

684
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:13,644
from that goddamn house, too.

685
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,889
This is so fucked.

686
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,001
Whole lotta fucked.

687
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:15,521
Elise?

688
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,206
Elise?

689
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,731
Elise?

690
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,611
Elise, are you okay?

691
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:46,800
Elise?

692
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:07,405
Chlo. Chlo. Chloe, hey.
Hey. Hey. Hey. You're okay.

693
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:11,360
You're okay. You're okay.
You're okay.

694
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:06,521
Police?

695
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,001
No, my mom.

696
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,566
<i>Hey.</i>

697
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,002
No, we're still in LA. Just...

698
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,482
No, just decided to stay another day.

699
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:20,608
No, no. It's fine. Don't worry.

700
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,601
I don't know yet.

701
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:24,801
Yes. We will.

702
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,090
Yes, I promise.

703
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,210
Did you tell her what happened?

704
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,803
I still don't even know
what happened.

705
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,565
Offerings.

706
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,329
She said she would be the first,
and the rest would be summoned.

707
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,969
We all made the choice
and grabbed her hand.

708
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:05,282
Chloe, she didn't know
what she was saying.

709
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,287
Look.

710
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,644
A couple of days
and we're out of here.

711
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,564
All right? We'll forget this.

712
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,281
Forget this?

713
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,003
How do you erase that
from your fucking mind?

714
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,811
- Chloe.
- She slit her own throat!

715
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,330
She died right in front of us.

716
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,801
Yeah, Chloe, I know.
I was there, too.

717
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,041
Look.

718
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,564
Another day,
and we'll be on the road.

719
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,206
All right?

720
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,966
Might even make the last night
of Coachella, God willing.

721
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:03,201
Chloe.

722
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,006
Elise, forget it.

723
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,724
No. I want to know
why she did it.

724
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:00,364
I want to know where she is.

725
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,364
She's not gonna tell you, she's dead.

726
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:08,806
I wanna know.

727
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:13,600
Come here.

728
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,005
<i>Oh, that's cute!</i>

729
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,041
David?

730
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,169
David?

731
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,721
Really? Who's the asshole?

732
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,848
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck, my ass.

733
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,570
What the hell
is your problem, Seth?

734
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,609
- I didn't do this.
- You're such an asshole.

735
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,366
- It's not funny, Seth.
- Fuck you. I didn't do shit!

736
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:47,816
Dave was the one in here, not me!

737
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,360
Dude, don't even
try that shit with me.

738
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,091
What the fuck?

739
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,291
Motherfuckers!

740
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,041
David, no.

741
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:20,726
What is this?

742
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,120
We don't even know
if it was them.

743
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:36,844
Yeah? Who the hell else
would it be?

744
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,047
Sick pieces of shit.

745
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,376
Let's just call the police.

746
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,640
David, let's call the police!

747
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,723
- I don't feel well.
- Shit.

748
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,167
- Hey!
- I don't feel well.

749
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,321
- Hey!
- David, stop!

750
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,891
They're not even open!

751
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:49,521
Fuckers!

752
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,446
Yo, there he is.

753
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:55,801
Hey!

754
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,162
- Shit.
- David!

755
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,768
Fuck! Jesus.

756
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,530
What? You want this?

757
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,125
David, no!

758
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:15,564
You think this shit is funny?
Breaking into my place?

759
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,416
Fuck you, man, I don't even know
where you live!

760
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,441
Bullshit!

761
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,329
- Fucker! Hit him again.
- David, no!

762
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,050
I repeat,
why'd you break into my place?

763
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,321
I didn't.

764
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,760
What'd you do to that girl, man?

765
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:25,841
- What?
- Alice!

766
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,570
- What'd you do to her?
- Nothing.

767
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,961
Nothing? She just slit
her throat in our hotel room

768
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:31,376
for no apparent fuckin' reason.

769
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:32,576
She said you made her do things.

770
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,656
Is that why you kicked her out
of your little bullshit cult?

771
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,256
You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about, man!

772
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,696
You got rid of her because
she wouldn't go along

773
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:40,451
- with your twisted shit!
- We wouldn't go along with hers, man!

774
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:47,366
We kicked her out
because she was too hardcore.

775
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:50,811
Even for us.

776
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:00,082
You broke my fuckin' nose, man!

777
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:05,444
What the hell's gotten into you?

778
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:06,920
What?
The fucker tried to slash me.

779
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,365
So you break his nose?

780
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,936
You should've
put it through his brain.

781
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,616
Goddamn it, we're already
in enough trouble,

782
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:12,641
we don't need any more!

783
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,680
- Chlo, don't get my fucking...
- Seth, shut up!

784
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,124
What is happening?

785
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,884
Fuck! Chloe!

786
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,361
Chloe. What is going on?

787
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,080
Can we get out of here please?
I don't really feel well.

788
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,764
I just want to
get the fuck out of here.

789
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,776
Can we get the fuck out
of here please? I feel sick.

790
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,484
Okay.
Hey, does anyone understand

791
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,296
that we are part
of a police investigation?

792
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:48,970
We can't leave town.

793
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:50,970
I wanna go. Can we go?

794
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:52,685
- Yeah, we can.
- Jesus!

795
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,649
- We can.
- No, we can't.

796
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,336
Okay, the police say
we can't go anywhere.

797
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,736
I don't care what they said.

798
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,524
Something happened in that hotel room

799
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,336
and it's still fucking happening
right now.

800
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:04,250
It's like we're marked or something.

801
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,004
You feel it. I know you do.

802
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,730
- I feel it.
- Come on.

803
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:10,121
- No. We have to leave.
- It just hurts a little bit.

804
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,406
Fucking look at her.

805
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:13,360
We can call the cops
in Boulder if you want.

806
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:19,491
Let's just grab our things and go.

All right.

815
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:33,161
Shit.

Do we even know
where we're <i>going?</i>

817

- What about up here?
- Chloe, there's nothing!

819

Oh, shit. Dave, pull over.

820

- What?
- No, you gotta pull over now.

No, no, no. We'll find you
somewhere else...

It hurts!

835
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,208
Chlo, is she okay?

836
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:58,090
Uh... Yeah.
It's okay. I'm right here.

837
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:02,851
- We need to get her to a hospital.
- What's wrong?

838
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,161
- I don't know.

Seth, stop.
Just give her a minute... Seth!

Where?

845
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:28,649
I don't know.

846
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:35,130
Seth, will you help me?
