By Mikhel for SUBTITULOS.ES
==SPREAD THE WORD==

5
00:02:54,082 --> 00:02:55,613
Help, help, I'm drown...

6
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,497
- Help, I'm drown...
- No!

7
00:03:05,647 --> 00:03:06,351
Help, I'm drown...

8
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:08,176
- No, no.
- Help, I'm drown...

9
00:03:08,473 --> 00:03:09,995
- Help, I'm drown...
- Don't drown.

10
00:03:10,006 --> 00:03:12,271
- I'm drown...
- You're OK now...

11
00:03:12,295 --> 00:03:14,272
Oh no! I'm here!

12
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:16,102
- You're not gonna drown! No!
- Help, I'm drown...

13
00:03:16,638 --> 00:03:18,364
Mr. Noonan?

14
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,851
- A-are you okay,
Mr. Noonan?

15
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:27,745
Uh...

16
00:03:29,703 --> 00:03:30,317
Yes.

17
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,159
Yes, I'm fine.

18
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,269
Yes, I'm fine, I'm just, uh...

19
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:41,906
I just slipped.

20
00:03:42,113 --> 00:03:44,567
I'm sorry to make
a habit of scaring you.

21
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:47,005
I-I just wanted
to get the upstairs

22
00:03:47,138 --> 00:03:49,303
as clean as I got
the downstairs the other day.

23
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:50,040
Yeah.

24
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:51,842
The tub needed a good scouring.

25
00:03:51,872 --> 00:03:52,454
Oh, yeah.

26
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:54,674
I wanted to fill it up and let it soak

27
00:03:54,803 --> 00:03:56,432
before I scrubbed and drained it.

28
00:03:56,655 --> 00:03:57,784
I hope you don't mind.

29
00:03:57,914 --> 00:03:59,835
No, good idea.
Scrub away.

30
00:04:01,778 --> 00:04:02,745
All's well.

31
00:04:04,441 --> 00:04:05,432
Please.
Thank you.

32
00:04:15,218 --> 00:04:16,388
Mr. Noonan?

33
00:04:20,487 --> 00:04:23,364
Yes, Mrs. Meserve?

34
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,568
Be careful... even though
it's cloudy out,

35
00:04:28,081 --> 00:04:29,518
the summer heat gets muggy.

36
00:04:30,097 --> 00:04:32,422
It's been known to drive
more than a few people

37
00:04:32,456 --> 00:04:34,436
a little Dark Score crazy.

38
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,676
That's the second time
I've heard that expression...

39
00:04:40,824 --> 00:04:42,073
"Dark Score crazy."

40
00:04:44,854 --> 00:04:45,646
What's it mean?

41
00:04:46,694 --> 00:04:49,366
Oh, it's...
It's that whole...

42
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:51,710
"Curse of Dark Score Lake" stuff...

43
00:04:52,097 --> 00:04:54,364
Just stories people tell
around the campfire.

44
00:04:54,622 --> 00:04:55,480
Stories?

45
00:04:58,638 --> 00:04:59,674
People going...

46
00:05:01,408 --> 00:05:02,191
You know...

47
00:05:05,682 --> 00:05:06,782
Mad?

48
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,045
Is that what happens when
people go Dark Score crazy?

49
00:05:12,174 --> 00:05:13,076
They go mad?

50
00:05:15,403 --> 00:05:17,393
No, seriously.
I mean, how does this happen?

51
00:05:17,435 --> 00:05:19,560
How does what happen,
Mr. Noonan?

52
00:05:19,576 --> 00:05:21,382
The madness.
Hmm?

53
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:26,120
What do people do when
they go Dark Score crazy?

54
00:05:29,674 --> 00:05:31,535
Mattie Devore's husband, Lance...

55
00:05:33,174 --> 00:05:35,256
He tried to drown their little girl.

56
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:37,137
Dad!

57
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,588
Who else?

58
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:45,041
There was normal Jellison back in '68.

59
00:05:45,126 --> 00:05:48,115
"Buddy Jellison's cafe"...
Normal Jellison?

60
00:05:48,253 --> 00:05:48,953
Buddy's father.

61
00:05:50,296 --> 00:05:52,599
He held Buddy's little sister
under the water...

62
00:05:53,049 --> 00:05:56,377
Drowned her...Right in front
of little Buddy's eyes.

63
00:05:56,545 --> 00:05:57,175
Who else?

64
00:05:59,011 --> 00:06:01,725
- Who else, Mrs. Meserve?
- I don't know.

65
00:06:03,183 --> 00:06:05,575
There was, uh...
Bill Dean's father.

66
00:06:05,577 --> 00:06:08,479
Bill Dean?
Our Bill Dean?

67
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,481
His father's name was Fred.

68
00:06:10,555 --> 00:06:12,002
Same kind of thing...

69
00:06:12,092 --> 00:06:13,891
Killed Billy's little sister

70
00:06:13,928 --> 00:06:17,525
40, maybe 50 years ago,
I guess it'd be...

71
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,839
Also when they were little.

72
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,736
Let me guess.
He tried to drown her.

73
00:06:28,327 --> 00:06:31,324
Drowned her right out there...

74
00:06:31,326 --> 00:06:34,317
Dark Score Lake.

75
00:06:34,411 --> 00:06:36,086
"Help me, I'm drowning."

76
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:39,012
Pardon me, Mr. Noonan?

77
00:06:39,228 --> 00:06:40,462
Nothing.

78
00:06:40,496 --> 00:06:42,561
Nothing, I was just, um...

79
00:06:42,595 --> 00:06:44,676
Thinking out loud, that's all.

80
00:06:44,722 --> 00:06:47,513
Of course, you didn't hear
any of this from me.

81
00:06:47,515 --> 00:06:49,542
- No.
- This is a small town.

82
00:06:49,614 --> 00:06:52,139
People don't take too kindly
to having their secrets spilled.

83
00:06:52,141 --> 00:06:55,576
It's surprising
the secrets that people keep.

84
00:06:55,746 --> 00:06:57,294
No, it ain't,
Mr. Noonan.

85
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,603
A person without secrets

86
00:06:58,654 --> 00:07:01,302
is like a scarecrow without stuffing.

87
00:07:01,304 --> 00:07:05,039
The things nobody knows
make us who we are.

88
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,155
Tell me something.

89
00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:15,983
Did my wife ever...

90
00:07:16,017 --> 00:07:17,987
Yes, Mr. Noonan?

91
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:28,929
Did Jo ever have...

92
00:07:28,931 --> 00:07:31,558
Any company here?

93
00:07:31,592 --> 00:07:35,602
"Company," Mr. Noonan?

94
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:40,576
Was my wife seeing someone?

95
00:07:40,612 --> 00:07:43,535
Not that I'm aware of,
Mr. Noonan.

96
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:49,758
Okay.

97
00:07:49,784 --> 00:07:52,025
Now, if there's nothing more...

98
00:07:52,059 --> 00:07:53,952
No.

99
00:07:54,003 --> 00:07:56,366
Thank you.

100
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,437
Oh, Jo.

101
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:11,738
Jo, I'm sorry.
I just...

102
00:09:05,608 --> 00:09:09,646
Overdue books?

103
00:10:08,456 --> 00:10:09,750
Come on, Jo.

104
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,361
What are you hiding from me?

105
00:10:11,408 --> 00:10:13,164
Show me.

106
00:11:38,263 --> 00:11:41,938
Oh!

107
00:12:46,323 --> 00:12:51,762
 Suddenly in my prime

108
00:12:51,796 --> 00:12:57,717
 I mean I'm happy as a bird 

109
00:12:57,812 --> 00:13:00,427
 flying up above

110
00:13:07,637 --> 00:13:11,693
"The Curse
of Dark Score Lake."

111
00:13:20,663 --> 00:13:22,912
Oh, Max Devore.

112
00:13:23,115 --> 00:13:25,261
You were as ugly then as you are now.

113
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,366
"Tanglewood nursing home."

114
00:13:50,755 --> 00:13:54,532
"And Sara Tidwell's disappearance

115
00:13:54,551 --> 00:13:58,437
"at the height of her fame
at the close of the 1930s

116
00:13:58,584 --> 00:14:01,972
gave rise
to much speculation."

117
00:14:14,422 --> 00:14:16,976
Hmm...

118
00:14:21,383 --> 00:14:23,637
 She was bored

119
00:14:23,713 --> 00:14:25,802
 but she was honest

120
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:30,136
 the victim of a rich man's whim 

121
00:14:30,177 --> 00:14:35,479
 he betrayed her in the garden 

122
00:14:41,986 --> 00:14:43,519
- Hey, you.
- Jackpot!

123
00:14:43,572 --> 00:14:46,735
What's that supposed to mean?

124
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:48,660
John Storrow, my lawyer...
He just called

125
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,336
and said that he found a link

126
00:14:50,369 --> 00:14:52,003
between Elmer Durgin,
you know, Kyra's Ad Litem

127
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,579
from the custody proceedings.

128
00:14:53,606 --> 00:14:55,187
Who's supposed to be
completely unbiased.

129
00:14:55,222 --> 00:14:57,475
Right, right, right... and
none other than Max Devore.

130
00:14:57,504 --> 00:14:58,962
- Get out of here.
- It's true!

131
00:14:59,013 --> 00:15:00,607
Since late may,
Durgin has paid off his house.

132
00:15:00,641 --> 00:15:02,666
He's paid off his car.
He's bought a boat.

133
00:15:02,715 --> 00:15:04,680
He's caught up on ten years'
worth of child support.

134
00:15:04,682 --> 00:15:06,711
All on a government salary.

135
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:08,657
And he's received several
deposits into his bank account,

136
00:15:08,673 --> 00:15:10,930
courtesy of Devore.

137
00:15:10,962 --> 00:15:12,598
It's over, Mike.

138
00:15:12,668 --> 00:15:14,685
It's over.
This custody case is over.

139
00:15:14,724 --> 00:15:16,553
They're not going to grant him
custody of Kyra,

140
00:15:16,612 --> 00:15:18,614
not with that type
of judicial tampering.

141
00:15:18,895 --> 00:15:20,519
Great.
The home team wins.

142
00:15:21,633 --> 00:15:22,981
Hmm?

143
00:15:24,004 --> 00:15:25,333
I can't thank you enough, Mike.

144
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,306
I mean, if you would've
caved in to Devore,

145
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:29,067
like everybody else in this town,

146
00:15:29,133 --> 00:15:31,577
Kyra and I would be saying
our good-byes probably soon.

147
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:33,301
Oh, well, thanks for saying so,

148
00:15:33,343 --> 00:15:34,750
but I don't think I really...
But... but nothing.

149
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,570
I mean, you stood up for us

150
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:41,105
as if you were our...
Our knight in shining armor.

151
00:15:41,578 --> 00:15:43,878
- Thanks.
- I'll never forget that.

152
00:15:49,525 --> 00:15:50,253
What is it?

153
00:15:52,111 --> 00:15:53,171
It's... it's him.

154
00:15:53,776 --> 00:15:54,214
Who?

155
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:56,102
Him.

156
00:15:56,137 --> 00:15:58,063
The... the guy, the one that
I saw Jo having dinner with

157
00:15:58,065 --> 00:16:00,690
at Warrington's.

158
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:02,541
That's the guy
I've been worried about...

159
00:16:02,543 --> 00:16:04,709
The one who I thought
was sleeping with Jo?

160
00:16:10,893 --> 00:16:12,839
That's my brother, Sid.

161
00:16:12,861 --> 00:16:13,893
What?

162
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,534
My gay brother, Sid.

163
00:16:19,556 --> 00:16:20,665
I love you, Sid.

164
00:16:23,739 --> 00:16:25,251
Yeah, well, it still doesn't explain

165
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,582
why she didn't tell me
she was pregnant

166
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:29,451
in the first place, but...

167
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,511
It's good enough for now.

168
00:16:31,545 --> 00:16:33,073
Yeah, I guess it is.

169
00:16:33,095 --> 00:16:35,515
Hey, listen, um...

170
00:16:35,584 --> 00:16:37,629
Thanks for coming over.
Are you kidding?

171
00:16:37,685 --> 00:16:39,772
I couldn't wait
to tell you the good news.

172
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:42,417
Well, congratulations.
It went well.

173
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,571
- I'll see you soon?
- Sure. Yeah.

174
00:16:58,605 --> 00:17:00,795
Good.

175
00:17:19,245 --> 00:17:20,938
Oh, my God.

176
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:25,088
Oh, my God.

177
00:17:30,629 --> 00:17:31,244
Jo?

178
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,362
Did you do this?

179
00:17:37,313 --> 00:17:38,346
Are you...

180
00:17:39,574 --> 00:17:40,431
Are you upset?

181
00:17:59,094 --> 00:18:02,558
 Frankie and Johnny
were sweethearts 

182
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:06,562
 oh, what a couple in love 

183
00:18:07,745 --> 00:18:09,881
I'm right there with you, baby.

184
00:18:09,915 --> 00:18:11,331
I'm right there with you, baby.

185
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:13,290
I'm right there with you, baby.

186
00:18:13,365 --> 00:18:14,792
- I'm right there with you, baby.
- Sara.

187
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:16,155
I'm right there with you, baby.

188
00:18:16,189 --> 00:18:17,851
Sara Tidwell.

189
00:19:00,985 --> 00:19:01,906
Oh, come on.

190
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:04,294
This damn thing's driving me nuts.

191
00:19:04,321 --> 00:19:05,122
Come on.

192
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:22,943
"Sid...Down...

193
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:25,780
Lift."

194
00:19:26,745 --> 00:19:30,694
Jo, is this about
your dinner with Sid?

195
00:19:43,707 --> 00:19:44,840
Hey, Sid, it's Mike.

196
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,931
Um, listen, when you get this message,

197
00:19:46,973 --> 00:19:48,387
will you give me a call?

198
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:50,129
Uh, there's something
I want to ask you.

199
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,250
Okay, talk soon.

200
00:20:01,091 --> 00:20:04,427
Okay.

201
00:20:31,415 --> 00:20:33,041
Hey, Sid.
Hey, Mikey.

202
00:20:33,075 --> 00:20:35,281
I just noticed
I missed your call... what's up?

203
00:20:35,314 --> 00:20:38,179
Uh...
It's, um...

204
00:20:38,251 --> 00:20:40,184
It's about Jo.

205
00:20:40,247 --> 00:20:41,698
You okay?

206
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:43,184
I haven't heard from you in a while.

207
00:20:43,232 --> 00:20:44,564
Starting to get worried.

208
00:20:44,598 --> 00:20:46,122
No, no, no, I'm great.

209
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:47,891
I'm really, really, really good.

210
00:20:47,925 --> 00:20:50,557
Uh, really enjoying myself out here.

211
00:20:50,591 --> 00:20:52,060
Glad you pushed me
out the door, you know.

212
00:20:52,112 --> 00:20:54,114
It's a change of scenery...

213
00:20:54,201 --> 00:20:55,405
Good for the spirit, so to speak.

214
00:20:55,448 --> 00:20:57,147
Well, that's great.

215
00:20:57,245 --> 00:20:59,266
You sound out of breath,
by the way, like, uh...

216
00:20:59,288 --> 00:21:01,159
Like you've been knockin'
the boots or something.

217
00:21:02,621 --> 00:21:05,418
No, no, no knocking boots for me.

218
00:21:05,452 --> 00:21:08,049
Yeah, well, okay, whatever, Mikey.

219
00:21:08,085 --> 00:21:09,001
So what's going on?

220
00:21:09,082 --> 00:21:10,619
Uh...

221
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,781
When, uh...

222
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:17,127
When you and Jo got together
up here for dinner, um...

223
00:21:17,147 --> 00:21:18,630
Yeah, it's that,
uh, big old place, um...

224
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,130
Warrington's?

225
00:21:20,138 --> 00:21:21,634
Warrington's!
Yeah, that's it.

226
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,264
Well, when you were there,

227
00:21:23,298 --> 00:21:25,268
or a-anywhere around
Dark Score, I guess,

228
00:21:25,302 --> 00:21:28,089
uh, did something happen with a lift?

229
00:21:28,145 --> 00:21:29,491
A lift?

230
00:21:29,657 --> 00:21:32,003
A lift. Uh, did you
take a lift somewhere?

231
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:33,701
Was there a place called "the lift"?

232
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:38,491
I mean, I-I don't know...
Anything to do with a lift.

233
00:21:38,854 --> 00:21:41,132
Sorry, Mikey, it's...
It's not ringing any bells.

234
00:21:43,318 --> 00:21:45,589
Okay, okay.
All right, uh...

235
00:21:46,949 --> 00:21:47,512
Don't worry.

236
00:21:47,554 --> 00:21:48,513
All's well.
Thanks.

237
00:21:48,911 --> 00:21:50,068
Why do you ask?

238
00:21:50,637 --> 00:21:52,988
Oh, it's... it's just, um,
something I'm working on,

239
00:21:52,999 --> 00:21:54,013
something that's, uh...

240
00:21:54,652 --> 00:21:56,527
Rattling around inside my head.

241
00:21:56,936 --> 00:21:59,445
Hey, fantastic!
Oh, that's great, Mikey.

242
00:21:59,534 --> 00:22:00,146
Glad to hear it.

243
00:22:00,717 --> 00:22:01,802
Sorry I couldn't help you, though.

244
00:22:02,108 --> 00:22:03,236
Yeah.

245
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,235
Hey, listen, Sidney, don't worry.

246
00:22:05,258 --> 00:22:07,199
You take care of yourself now.
Love you.

247
00:22:07,233 --> 00:22:09,284
Talk to you soon, Mikey.
Bye.

248
00:22:09,335 --> 00:22:11,567
Okay, take care.

249
00:22:11,589 --> 00:22:14,236
All right.

250
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:22,207
Hey, green lady.

251
00:22:22,263 --> 00:22:26,599
How are you this day, huh?

252
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:30,356
Oh?

253
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,105
You want to tell me something?

254
00:22:32,139 --> 00:22:36,137
Hmm?

255
00:23:34,502 --> 00:23:38,538
Oh, Jesus.

256
00:23:43,425 --> 00:23:46,374
Yeah.

257
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:54,480
Whore run off and left you,
has she, Noonan?

258
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,212
I always liked a whore.

259
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,377
Didn't I, rogette?

260
00:23:58,485 --> 00:24:01,826
Yes, sir...
In their place.

261
00:24:02,211 --> 00:24:04,313
She good, that little whore?

262
00:24:05,334 --> 00:24:09,211
Must be good to have
kept my son a prisoner

263
00:24:09,235 --> 00:24:11,095
in that nasty little trailer

264
00:24:11,953 --> 00:24:13,326
before killing him.

265
00:24:13,749 --> 00:24:15,277
What do you want, Devore?

266
00:24:15,578 --> 00:24:18,274
Do you care
about your soul, Mr. Noonan?

267
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,436
God's butterfly caught
in a cocoon of flesh

268
00:24:22,438 --> 00:24:26,094
that will one day stink and rot

269
00:24:26,096 --> 00:24:27,641
just like mine.

270
00:24:27,696 --> 00:24:31,660
What the hell are you talking about?

271
00:24:31,727 --> 00:24:34,282
I'm going to give you
one chance to save your soul.

272
00:24:34,316 --> 00:24:36,094
Go away...

273
00:24:36,199 --> 00:24:37,542
Right now, this very day,

274
00:24:37,544 --> 00:24:40,713
in the clothes you stand in,

275
00:24:40,747 --> 00:24:44,559
and leave the whore
and the "whorelet" to me.

276
00:24:44,594 --> 00:24:46,173
That "whorelet" you're talking about

277
00:24:46,207 --> 00:24:47,821
is your granddaughter!

278
00:24:47,908 --> 00:24:52,685
I'm not afraid to do
the things that need to be done.

279
00:24:52,752 --> 00:24:55,530
You're even crazier
than I thought, the two of you.

280
00:24:55,564 --> 00:24:57,373
Are you sure you want to be

281
00:24:57,407 --> 00:25:00,577
the little girl's hero, Noonan?

282
00:25:00,594 --> 00:25:02,621
Just get out of my space,
the two of you.

283
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,511
Are you crazy?

284
00:25:23,373 --> 00:25:26,062
Rogette was always quite an athlete.

285
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,428
Don't forget, Mr. Noonan...

286
00:25:46,673 --> 00:25:49,904
Custody has its responsibilities.

287
00:26:32,585 --> 00:26:35,333
Hi, you've reached the lake house,
please leave me a message.

288
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:37,387
Hey, Mike, I tried to call your cell,

289
00:26:37,407 --> 00:26:38,838
but the voice mail didn't pick up.

290
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:40,481
I Fed Ex'd you a bunch of galleys

291
00:26:40,509 --> 00:26:42,350
<i>for red shirt man earlier today.</i>

292
00:26:42,778 --> 00:26:43,964
And I got to tell you again, Mike,

293
00:26:44,532 --> 00:26:46,869
I think this is the best
Michael Noonan book yet.

294
00:26:47,027 --> 00:26:48,841
Scribner feels the same way, too,

295
00:26:49,073 --> 00:26:51,247
which is why they did such great
work on the cover, I think.

296
00:26:51,284 --> 00:26:54,566
Mm, I should have sent them
the one I wrote 15 years ago.

297
00:26:54,631 --> 00:26:56,894
That one would have really
knocked their socks off.

298
00:26:56,897 --> 00:26:58,817
But as you know, with this
crunch publication schedule,

299
00:26:58,871 --> 00:27:00,097
time is of the essence,

300
00:27:00,203 --> 00:27:02,189
so the sooner you can get back to us

301
00:27:02,219 --> 00:27:03,758
with your final revisions, the better.

302
00:27:03,802 --> 00:27:05,624
Oh, sure, Marty.

303
00:27:05,678 --> 00:27:07,770
Nothing pressing going on here, mate.

304
00:27:07,772 --> 00:27:09,542
Thanks, Mike... hope
you're doing well otherwise.

305
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:13,241
Give my love to...

306
00:27:13,276 --> 00:27:16,738
I'll see you soon, Mike.
Congratulations again.

307
00:27:42,508 --> 00:27:44,798
Why not?

308
00:28:01,393 --> 00:28:02,965
"Sid down lift."

309
00:28:16,052 --> 00:28:20,593
"Side down left."

310
00:28:20,595 --> 00:28:22,889
"Side...Down...Left."

311
00:28:25,999 --> 00:28:26,870
Down left side.

312
00:28:28,426 --> 00:28:29,201
Down left side.

313
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:29,938
Hmm.

314
00:28:33,246 --> 00:28:34,337
There you go.

315
00:28:37,718 --> 00:28:39,640
There you go.

316
00:28:39,675 --> 00:28:40,677
Gotcha.

317
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:46,808
Oh, Jo.
Jo, Jo, Jo.

318
00:28:46,857 --> 00:28:48,827
<i>You and I were such nuts
for times crosswords.</i>

319
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:52,146
Weren't we just?

320
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:55,062
Although I think I was the bigger nut.

321
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:57,118
Here we go.
All right.

322
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,479
"Booya-moon.
Booya-moon."

323
00:29:00,744 --> 00:29:03,522
"Booya-moon"?

324
00:29:03,639 --> 00:29:04,879
What does that mean?

325
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:15,678
Yes?

326
00:29:15,702 --> 00:29:16,884
Ah.

327
00:29:16,886 --> 00:29:19,619
Deputy foot...Man.

328
00:29:20,246 --> 00:29:21,324
I've got a message for you.

329
00:29:21,608 --> 00:29:22,909
Do you, now?
What is it?

330
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,207
Another threat from Methuselah?

331
00:29:24,224 --> 00:29:25,148
No threats.

332
00:29:25,789 --> 00:29:27,270
You might call this good news.

333
00:29:27,738 --> 00:29:29,689
You know your boss
almost killed me today?

334
00:29:29,758 --> 00:29:30,235
Yeah.

335
00:29:30,956 --> 00:29:32,807
If you promise to cease
all legal maneuvers,

336
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,464
if you promise to let Mr.
Devore rest in peace, so to speak,

337
00:29:36,905 --> 00:29:38,412
then he promises to cease his efforts

338
00:29:38,446 --> 00:29:40,043
to gain custody of his granddaughter.

339
00:29:40,685 --> 00:29:41,436
What are you saying?

340
00:29:42,066 --> 00:29:44,876
If this suits you,
call Mr. Devore at Warrington's

341
00:29:45,306 --> 00:29:46,935
and tell him you agree to the terms.

342
00:29:46,937 --> 00:29:48,654
- Uh-huh.
And what's the catch?

343
00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:50,291
There's no catch.

344
00:29:50,293 --> 00:29:52,162
Mr. Devore is nothing
if not a man of his word.

345
00:29:52,196 --> 00:29:53,661
Hmm.

346
00:29:57,918 --> 00:30:00,016
Peachy.

347
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,609
Rogette Whitmore speaking.

348
00:30:12,643 --> 00:30:14,490
- Uh-huh.
This is Mike Noonan.

349
00:30:14,682 --> 00:30:17,723
So wonderful to hear
from you, Mr. Noonan.

350
00:30:17,773 --> 00:30:20,340
Did you enjoy your swim?

351
00:30:20,409 --> 00:30:25,144
You and Mr. Devore seem
to be sore losers, Ms. Whitmore.

352
00:30:25,146 --> 00:30:29,208
Mr. Devore does not lose.

353
00:30:29,263 --> 00:30:31,834
But he does not lose.

354
00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:36,340
You were the one who looked
like a loser today, Mr. Noonan...

355
00:30:36,379 --> 00:30:40,063
Pawing around and yelping out
there like a bitch in heat.

356
00:30:40,109 --> 00:30:41,841
Listen, you ugly bitch,

357
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:44,629
if either of you ever
try anything like that again,

358
00:30:44,663 --> 00:30:46,100
I'm going to come over there

359
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,883
and wring your scrawny Turkey necks.

360
00:30:47,943 --> 00:30:49,430
Do you understand me?

361
00:30:49,457 --> 00:30:52,730
And who's the sore loser now,
Mr. Noonan?

362
00:30:54,206 --> 00:30:59,137
Enough pleasantries.

363
00:30:59,186 --> 00:31:01,873
We have a deal.

364
00:31:01,895 --> 00:31:05,346
Wonderful, Mr. Noonan.

365
00:31:11,907 --> 00:31:13,607
And before I let you go,

366
00:31:13,609 --> 00:31:16,227
Mr. Devore would like me
to remind you

367
00:31:17,062 --> 00:31:21,038
"custody has
its responsibilities."

368
00:34:12,461 --> 00:34:16,651
 Sometimes I feel

369
00:34:17,628 --> 00:34:20,406
 like a motherless child

370
00:34:22,491 --> 00:34:25,261
 sometimes I feel

371
00:34:26,666 --> 00:34:30,081
 like a motherless child

372
00:34:31,047 --> 00:34:34,660
 sometimes I feel

373
00:34:34,669 --> 00:34:43,237
 like a motherless child  a long way

374
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:52,753
 from home  a long ways from home 

375
00:34:56,741 --> 00:35:01,622
 Sometimes I feel

376
00:35:01,656 --> 00:35:06,283
 like I'm almost gone

377
00:35:06,317 --> 00:35:10,348
 sometimes I feel

378
00:35:10,429 --> 00:35:15,507
 like I'm almost gone

379
00:35:15,596 --> 00:35:19,645
 sometimes I feel

380
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:29,450
 like I'm almost gone  a long way

381
00:35:29,485 --> 00:35:33,485
 from home  a long way  from home 

382
00:36:05,024 --> 00:36:06,477
What happened to you, Sara?

383
00:36:18,404 --> 00:36:20,392
Mike, Mr. Mike, help me!

384
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:22,662
Sweetheart, what's wrong, child?

385
00:36:22,692 --> 00:36:25,580
Huh?
Where is she?

386
00:36:25,612 --> 00:36:27,698
Okay, come.
Come with me.

387
00:36:27,732 --> 00:36:29,496
There, there!

388
00:36:29,573 --> 00:36:33,881
 Sometimes I feel

389
00:36:33,915 --> 00:36:35,378
Come, come, quick, quick.

390
00:36:35,412 --> 00:36:39,626
 Like a motherless child okay.

391
00:36:39,661 --> 00:36:41,184
Uh, let's go down this way, come on.

392
00:36:41,296 --> 00:36:44,255
Come this way.

393
00:36:52,923 --> 00:36:55,058
Over here!

394
00:37:11,825 --> 00:37:14,075
This way, this way.

395
00:37:43,196 --> 00:37:45,397
Let's go in here, in here.
Very quiet.

396
00:37:46,233 --> 00:37:47,754
There's a good girl.

397
00:37:48,368 --> 00:37:49,441
Stay there, okay?

398
00:37:58,668 --> 00:38:00,340
I'm scared, Mr. Mike.

399
00:38:01,535 --> 00:38:03,294
We're going to be fine, Kyra.

400
00:38:03,661 --> 00:38:06,372
But you have to be very, very quiet.

401
00:38:06,632 --> 00:38:07,438
Okay?

402
00:38:08,056 --> 00:38:08,961
All right.

403
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,582
Really quiet.

404
00:38:25,953 --> 00:38:29,086
Just keep squeezing my hand
if you feel scared, okay?

405
00:38:33,109 --> 00:38:33,727
But...

406
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:37,271
I'm not holding
your hand, Mr. Mike.

407
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,704
Are you scared, too, little one?

408
00:38:52,847 --> 00:38:55,506
Oh, child.
Do you want us to help you?

409
00:38:56,452 --> 00:38:58,100
Max Devore is dead.

410
00:38:59,748 --> 00:39:03,073
But custody still has
its responsibilities!

411
00:39:03,277 --> 00:39:05,285
No!

412
00:39:05,325 --> 00:39:08,615
- They're hurting me!
- Kyra!

413
00:39:08,647 --> 00:39:12,232
Please help me!

414
00:39:25,049 --> 00:39:27,255
Kyra!

415
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:37,059
Kyra!

416
00:39:39,097 --> 00:39:42,121
Lie still, bag of bones.

417
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,875
Shit.

418
00:39:49,003 --> 00:39:51,350
Oh, jeez.

419
00:39:56,043 --> 00:39:58,481
Hey.

420
00:39:58,495 --> 00:40:00,716
Hello?

421
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:03,040
Mike, it's Mattie.

422
00:40:03,133 --> 00:40:04,984
Hey, Mattie, how are you?

423
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,456
You'll never guess
what I'm calling to tell you.

424
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:11,047
- Max Devore's dead?
- Yes.

425
00:40:11,049 --> 00:40:12,942
He killed himself last night.

426
00:40:12,968 --> 00:40:15,521
Is it already making the rounds?

427
00:40:15,523 --> 00:40:17,438
Yeah, yeah, something like that.

428
00:40:17,507 --> 00:40:19,916
You know what this means, Mike?

429
00:40:20,145 --> 00:40:22,000
- Uh-uh, no,
what is it?

430
00:40:22,114 --> 00:40:23,686
It's over.

431
00:40:23,728 --> 00:40:26,561
That's good.

432
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:28,366
That's really good, Mattie.

433
00:40:28,368 --> 00:40:31,280
I'm very happy for you.
Congratulations.

434
00:40:36,835 --> 00:40:39,235
Do you want to come over
tomorrow night after the funeral?

435
00:40:39,976 --> 00:40:41,318
- A-are you going
to the funeral?

436
00:40:41,695 --> 00:40:42,830
No, but you are.

437
00:40:44,945 --> 00:40:48,059
And you're going to come over and
tell me every little last detail.

438
00:40:49,418 --> 00:40:50,610
Uh...

439
00:40:51,441 --> 00:40:54,528
Well, let... let me just think
about this one, now.

440
00:40:54,697 --> 00:40:57,470
I'm not sure.
Um, just let me think about it.

441
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:58,600
Absolutely.

442
00:40:58,627 --> 00:41:00,197
I mean, you take
all the time you need, but...

443
00:41:02,428 --> 00:41:03,736
Go on.
But what?

444
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:08,053
Jo would want you
to be happy, you know?

445
00:41:12,088 --> 00:41:14,263
I'm sorry.

446
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:15,913
I'm sorry.
I-I shouldn't have said that.

447
00:41:15,937 --> 00:41:18,757
I-I-I shouldn't have said
any of this.

448
00:41:18,802 --> 00:41:20,091
It's okay.

449
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:22,783
It's okay.

450
00:41:22,789 --> 00:41:25,189
You've done no wrong.
All's good.

451
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:28,572
I'll come over for dinner
tomorrow night.

452
00:41:32,158 --> 00:41:34,776
I look forward to it.

453
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:37,124
Yeah, yeah, me too.
Okay.

454
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,048
Good-bye.

455
00:41:39,076 --> 00:41:41,226
Okay, bye.

456
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:59,707
Lie still bag of bones.
Lie still bag of bones.

457
00:42:08,613 --> 00:42:12,480
Lie still bag of bones.
Lie still bag of bones.

458
00:42:23,762 --> 00:42:24,618
Oh, God.

459
00:44:24,939 --> 00:44:25,589
Hello, sir.

460
00:44:28,266 --> 00:44:29,310
What are you doing here?

461
00:44:29,508 --> 00:44:31,568
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to disturb you.

462
00:44:31,569 --> 00:44:33,628
Harold, is it really you?

463
00:44:34,011 --> 00:44:34,659
Harold?

464
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:38,615
You look so young, so young.

465
00:44:38,866 --> 00:44:41,394
But you're dead, Harold.

466
00:44:41,593 --> 00:44:42,636
What are you doing here?

467
00:44:42,864 --> 00:44:44,606
How can this be?
Sir, I'm not...

468
00:44:44,629 --> 00:44:46,081
Max is dead.

469
00:44:46,731 --> 00:44:48,576
I went to his funeral today.

470
00:44:49,132 --> 00:44:53,402
Old mad Max Devore is finally dead.

471
00:44:54,027 --> 00:44:57,515
Sir...
I'm not Harold.

472
00:44:58,322 --> 00:44:59,240
I'm Mike.

473
00:45:00,296 --> 00:45:01,510
Harold was my grandfather.

474
00:45:01,681 --> 00:45:06,314
And I take it
that you and my grandfather

475
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:08,883
were old friends.

476
00:45:09,789 --> 00:45:11,128
We grew up together.

477
00:45:12,158 --> 00:45:12,659
Yeah.

478
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,026
My name is Edgar white.

479
00:45:16,078 --> 00:45:17,889
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Mr. white.

480
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:19,611
Oh, "Edgar" is fine.

481
00:45:20,901 --> 00:45:22,709
"Mr. white"
is my old man.

482
00:45:22,743 --> 00:45:27,652
And he's been gone for a long time.

483
00:45:27,654 --> 00:45:30,774
What are you doing here?

484
00:45:30,815 --> 00:45:34,637
Well, I was at, uh,
Max Devore's funeral today,

485
00:45:34,696 --> 00:45:36,268
and I saw you.

486
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:40,575
And, um, well,
you looked pretty upset.

487
00:45:40,603 --> 00:45:43,403
Max was an old friend.

488
00:45:43,437 --> 00:45:46,237
It's never easy to bury an old friend.

489
00:45:46,302 --> 00:45:49,551
Mm.

490
00:45:49,587 --> 00:45:53,923
Max Devore and me...
We grew up together.

491
00:45:53,957 --> 00:45:57,541
Harold and normal and Fred...

492
00:45:57,543 --> 00:46:00,641
And old Max, of course.

493
00:46:00,787 --> 00:46:04,176
They're all gone now.

494
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:08,499
I'm the last one left.

495
00:46:08,552 --> 00:46:11,254
But, you know,

496
00:46:11,288 --> 00:46:13,485
I told your missus
all of this already.

497
00:46:13,487 --> 00:46:15,963
My missus?

498
00:46:15,965 --> 00:46:18,234
Well, yeah, yeah, um...

499
00:46:18,307 --> 00:46:19,842
Jo Noonan, right?

500
00:46:19,844 --> 00:46:22,018
- Mm-hmm.

501
00:46:22,086 --> 00:46:24,431
I didn't realize
you and she had talked.

502
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,202
Pretty gal.

503
00:46:26,458 --> 00:46:27,364
How is she?

504
00:46:29,364 --> 00:46:30,138
She, uh...

505
00:46:31,298 --> 00:46:32,270
She passed away.

506
00:46:36,566 --> 00:46:38,249
Sorry to hear that.

507
00:46:39,597 --> 00:46:40,858
What did you two talk about?

508
00:46:41,264 --> 00:46:43,848
Oh, nothing much.

509
00:46:44,631 --> 00:46:46,938
She had a bunch of questions
about the history

510
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:48,239
of Dark Score Lake.

511
00:46:49,121 --> 00:46:51,522
Said she wanted to write an
article or a book or something.

512
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:56,783
Did she want to know
about Dark Score fair in 1939...

513
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:00,488
And Sara Tidwell?

514
00:47:02,764 --> 00:47:04,327
Among other things, yeah.

515
00:47:06,141 --> 00:47:07,371
But I told her...

516
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:10,081
I don't know anything.

517
00:47:10,834 --> 00:47:12,908
But you were lying to her,
weren't you?

518
00:47:13,577 --> 00:47:14,083
Hmm?

519
00:47:15,067 --> 00:47:16,379
You do know something.

520
00:47:17,003 --> 00:47:19,026
I bet there's lots of things you know

521
00:47:19,028 --> 00:47:23,778
you wish you could just forget, hmm?

522
00:47:26,035 --> 00:47:29,649
Max Devore is dead now, Edgar.

523
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:31,393
He can't hurt you anymore.

524
00:47:31,423 --> 00:47:36,487
That's not always true.

525
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:39,933
Tell me the secret of Max Devore

526
00:47:39,935 --> 00:47:44,978
that you keep in your heart
after all these years.

527
00:47:47,091 --> 00:47:50,027
Tell me, Edgar.

528
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:52,171
Tell me what happened...

529
00:47:52,339 --> 00:48:01,429
To you, Max Devore... And Sara Tidwell.

530
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:03,734
It's not about what happened

531
00:48:03,757 --> 00:48:07,008
between me and Devore
and Sara Tidwell.

532
00:48:07,036 --> 00:48:09,095
What is it, then?

533
00:48:09,129 --> 00:48:12,787
It's about what we did.

534
00:48:12,902 --> 00:48:16,095
Tell me.

535
00:48:16,142 --> 00:48:18,555
Just tell me.

536
00:48:18,589 --> 00:48:22,135
It was the summer of '39...

537
00:48:24,305 --> 00:48:26,206
At the Dark Score fair.

538
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,288


539
00:48:27,347 --> 00:48:29,244
 she was poor...

540
00:48:29,264 --> 00:48:33,880
Sara Tidwell was performing
on the main stage.

541
00:48:33,936 --> 00:48:36,387
And she was like nothing

542
00:48:36,421 --> 00:48:39,889
we had ever seen before
around these parts.

543
00:48:39,923 --> 00:48:42,273


544
00:48:42,314 --> 00:48:45,894
it was me, Fred Dean,

545
00:48:45,928 --> 00:48:51,270
normal Jellison,
your grandfather Harold Noonan,

546
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,294
and mad Max Devore.

547
00:48:54,373 --> 00:48:58,877
Even then, Max was
the man with the plan.

548
00:48:58,915 --> 00:49:01,996
And everyone knew
that he would eventually

549
00:49:02,048 --> 00:49:05,589
run Dark Score Lake

550
00:49:05,623 --> 00:49:09,280
and become a very rich
and important man in the world.

551
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:12,900
It was Max's idea to go to the show.

552
00:49:12,919 --> 00:49:14,222
 He took her in...

553
00:49:14,261 --> 00:49:19,279
We were all het up from the show.

554
00:49:19,322 --> 00:49:21,397
 A small port wine

555
00:49:21,467 --> 00:49:25,574
and it was Max who suggested
we pay Sara a visit afterwards.

556
00:49:29,537 --> 00:49:33,945
Of course, none of us knew
what Max had planned.

557
00:49:33,979 --> 00:49:37,149
At least that's what
I've been telling myself

558
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,320
all these years.

559
00:49:39,331 --> 00:49:41,535
I liked your show.

560
00:49:43,585 --> 00:49:47,294
Well, thank you, sugar.

561
00:49:47,328 --> 00:49:49,171
Maybe I'll see you at the next one.

562
00:49:49,209 --> 00:49:51,006
I'm talking to you, girl.

563
00:49:51,043 --> 00:49:52,293
Don't you turn away from me.

564
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:56,175
Liking my singing
doesn't buy you a right to me.

565
00:49:58,099 --> 00:49:59,268
Stop her!

566
00:50:07,475 --> 00:50:10,449
You think you can sing the way you do

567
00:50:10,485 --> 00:50:11,944
and get away with it, huh?

568
00:50:11,982 --> 00:50:14,537
You think you and your
kind can boil our blood

569
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:17,537
and not give us what we want
when you're done, huh?

570
00:50:17,568 --> 00:50:21,456
Come here.

571
00:50:21,491 --> 00:50:24,244
Get over here and help me
hold her down, damn it.

572
00:50:28,086 --> 00:50:29,494
Gonna teach this uppity bitch

573
00:50:29,546 --> 00:50:34,644
a lesson.

574
00:50:34,673 --> 00:50:36,544
You going to tell me
you're sorry, bitch?

575
00:50:36,598 --> 00:50:38,761
You going to beg me for forgiveness?

576
00:50:38,808 --> 00:50:40,424
I don't beg for nothing...

577
00:50:42,141 --> 00:50:44,813
Especially not for no little boy.

578
00:50:55,281 --> 00:50:57,238
Go home, honey!

579
00:50:57,284 --> 00:50:59,538
Now! Run!

580
00:51:00,033 --> 00:51:00,987
Mommy!

581
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:04,281
Run, Kisha baby, run!
Run!

582
00:51:04,297 --> 00:51:05,546
Where's all your tough talk now?

583
00:51:05,601 --> 00:51:06,934
Not my daughter.

584
00:51:06,965 --> 00:51:08,268
Please don't hurt my little girl.

585
00:51:08,335 --> 00:51:10,402
I'll do anything...

586
00:51:10,587 --> 00:51:11,699
Anything you say!
Please!

587
00:51:11,872 --> 00:51:14,270
You already are doing anything I say.

588
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:16,319
Get her.

589
00:51:16,772 --> 00:51:18,307
You think we can leave any witnesses?

590
00:51:18,333 --> 00:51:20,006
Even I can't get us out of this one.

591
00:51:20,029 --> 00:51:21,843
Now catch that little girl
and take her out to the lake.

592
00:51:21,888 --> 00:51:24,396
No! Oh, God,!

593
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:26,895
Please, please...

594
00:51:26,943 --> 00:51:28,980
Please, I'll do anything.

595
00:51:29,031 --> 00:51:32,701
Please just don't hurt my little girl.

596
00:51:32,772 --> 00:51:35,370
Please.
Please!

597
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:40,083
Help, I'm drown...

598
00:51:40,117 --> 00:51:42,419
Please, don't hurt my baby!

599
00:51:45,741 --> 00:51:46,849
Please, God!

600
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,356
No, no, no!

601
00:51:49,568 --> 00:51:51,316
Shut that bitch up.
Somebody's going to hear her.

602
00:51:51,529 --> 00:51:53,809
Oh, no!
No, stop!

603
00:52:15,881 --> 00:52:16,779
You...

604
00:52:17,607 --> 00:52:21,141
And your kin are cursed!

605
00:52:22,934 --> 00:52:25,594
You and your sons

606
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:30,059
are going to do to your daughters
what you've done to mine.

607
00:52:31,149 --> 00:52:33,218
With your own hands,

608
00:52:33,386 --> 00:52:36,330
you will murder your daughters.

609
00:52:37,268 --> 00:52:38,964
And with their own hands,

610
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:42,647
your sons are going
to murder their daughters.

611
00:52:44,023 --> 00:52:47,978
A curse on you and yours

612
00:52:48,065 --> 00:52:51,066
until you're all gone!

613
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:09,314
Max told us
that we could never mention

614
00:53:09,334 --> 00:53:11,612
a word of it to anyone

615
00:53:11,673 --> 00:53:14,284
for as long as we lived,

616
00:53:14,332 --> 00:53:16,622
that it would ruin us all.

617
00:53:16,656 --> 00:53:22,210
He had us bury their bodies
out in the woods.

618
00:53:22,272 --> 00:53:24,358
And that was the end of Sara Tidwell

619
00:53:26,224 --> 00:53:27,489
and her daughter, Kisha.

620
00:54:42,337 --> 00:54:43,829
- Hi.
- Hey.

621
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:46,136
- Come in.
- I made it.

622
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:53,695
- Y-you don't...

623
00:55:03,115 --> 00:55:04,309
"Kiss the cook".

624
00:55:07,819 --> 00:55:08,638
Well?

625
00:55:10,832 --> 00:55:11,575
Well.

626
00:55:41,248 --> 00:55:42,391
I think we have a visitor.

627
00:55:44,498 --> 00:55:47,058
- Hi, Mr. Mike.
- Hi, miss Ky.

628
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:49,368
How's it going?

629
00:55:49,996 --> 00:55:51,557
- Good.
- Good.

630
00:55:51,749 --> 00:55:52,508
What you up to?

631
00:55:52,899 --> 00:55:55,477
Will you read me
my bedtime story, please?

632
00:55:55,631 --> 00:55:58,073
Sweetheart, I told you,
no begging Mr. Mike.

633
00:55:58,222 --> 00:56:00,730
I would be more than happy
to read you a bedtime story.

634
00:56:00,745 --> 00:56:02,295
Come on.
Hooray!

635
00:56:05,393 --> 00:56:06,564
How can I refuse?

636
00:56:06,721 --> 00:56:07,959
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

637
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:18,558
"For her birthday, Kim's mom
invited her to the fair

638
00:56:18,761 --> 00:56:20,565
"that just came to town for the week.

639
00:56:21,099 --> 00:56:23,182
"'Get dressed, my love,
and we'll go.'

640
00:56:23,539 --> 00:56:24,378
"'okay, mom.'

641
00:56:25,368 --> 00:56:28,780
"at the fair, many people
were waiting to buy tickets.

642
00:56:29,348 --> 00:56:32,865
"From far away, she saw the big wheel.

643
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:35,387
Kim was so happy."

644
00:56:36,634 --> 00:56:38,623
I dreamed about you the other night.

645
00:56:40,808 --> 00:56:41,406
You did?

646
00:56:43,934 --> 00:56:44,773
Mm-hmm.

647
00:56:47,329 --> 00:56:48,562
And what was your dream about?

648
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:51,031
A circus...

649
00:56:54,946 --> 00:56:55,471
Or...

650
00:56:56,315 --> 00:56:58,280
A fair or something.

651
00:56:58,920 --> 00:56:59,762
And...

652
00:57:01,911 --> 00:57:04,426
What happened in this dream
of yours the other night?

653
00:57:05,496 --> 00:57:07,697
You were trying to save me
from the bad men,

654
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,273
and the mad lady was singing.

655
00:57:11,174 --> 00:57:14,001
And we hid in a real scary place.

656
00:57:14,523 --> 00:57:17,396
But the mad lady's little girl
was hiding, too.

657
00:57:20,018 --> 00:57:21,381
And that girl...

658
00:57:22,803 --> 00:57:24,703
Was she the mad lady's daughter?

659
00:57:25,402 --> 00:57:26,345
- Mm-hmm.

660
00:57:26,475 --> 00:57:29,703


661
00:57:29,748 --> 00:57:30,743
how do you know that?

662
00:57:31,467 --> 00:57:33,517
Because she told me, silly.

663
00:57:35,346 --> 00:57:36,249
She did?

664
00:57:37,077 --> 00:57:38,711
- Mm-hmm.
She's my friend.

665
00:57:39,307 --> 00:57:41,504
Oh, she's your friend.

666
00:57:44,643 --> 00:57:45,512
Since when?

667
00:57:46,643 --> 00:57:47,521
Ever since...

668
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:52,408
Her mommy, the mad lady,
made my daddy try to...

669
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:55,370
Hurt me.

670
00:58:00,425 --> 00:58:02,630
It was the mad lady
who made your daddy do that?

671
00:58:03,426 --> 00:58:04,153
- Mm-hmm.

672
00:58:04,597 --> 00:58:06,353
Her daughter's name is Kisha.

673
00:58:07,052 --> 00:58:08,749
And it's called a curse.

674
00:58:11,158 --> 00:58:12,033
A curse.

675
00:58:14,178 --> 00:58:16,636
Can we finish reading
my book now, Mr. Mike?

676
00:58:20,114 --> 00:58:22,383
Sure.
On one condition.

677
00:58:23,966 --> 00:58:25,092
You call me "Mike."

678
00:58:25,754 --> 00:58:26,674
Okay, Mike.

679
00:58:27,141 --> 00:58:30,211
It's a deal.
It's a deal.

680
00:58:55,509 --> 00:58:56,171
How is she?

681
00:58:56,542 --> 00:58:57,827
She's good.
She's, uh...

682
00:58:58,402 --> 00:58:59,602
Out like a light.

683
00:59:02,376 --> 00:59:03,839
What's the matter?

684
00:59:04,745 --> 00:59:07,361
She, uh... I don't know...
She mentioned something

685
00:59:07,376 --> 00:59:10,125
- about a little girl named Kisha.
- Oh, yeah.

686
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:11,667
That's her imaginary friend, Kisha,

687
00:59:11,723 --> 00:59:12,899
but it's okay, 'cause the doctor said

688
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:15,573
that she's perfectly normal
and I don't have a crazy kid,

689
00:59:15,574 --> 00:59:17,413
so that's...
That's good.

690
00:59:20,204 --> 00:59:21,142
So the funeral?

691
00:59:22,493 --> 00:59:23,721
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have made you go.

692
00:59:23,722 --> 00:59:24,940
No, no, no, no, no,
actually that's been the

693
00:59:24,941 --> 00:59:26,157
best part of the last
couple of days for me...

694
00:59:27,090 --> 00:59:30,009
Seeing that old bastard lowered
into the ground once and for all.

695
00:59:31,154 --> 00:59:32,483
- Yeah.
- I, um...

696
00:59:35,306 --> 00:59:37,488
I learned about the disappearance

697
00:59:37,526 --> 00:59:40,044
of Sara Tidwell today

698
00:59:40,094 --> 00:59:43,297
from an old man in a rest home,

699
00:59:43,331 --> 00:59:47,985
who, it turns out, Jo had also
visited before she died.

700
00:59:50,132 --> 00:59:53,325
Do you know who Sara Tidwell is?

701
00:59:53,343 --> 00:59:57,095
Lance, my husband, used
to listen to her music before...

702
01:00:00,959 --> 01:00:03,142
I, uh... I didn't know
she disappeared.

703
01:00:03,241 --> 01:00:05,692
In 1939.

704
01:00:05,733 --> 01:00:07,924
Only she didn't really
disappear... she was killed.

705
01:00:07,926 --> 01:00:10,520
After she played
at the Dark Score fair one day,

706
01:00:10,554 --> 01:00:12,952
she was raped.

707
01:00:15,168 --> 01:00:18,036
And then she and
her little daughter, Kisha,

708
01:00:18,038 --> 01:00:19,751
were killed by a group of teenagers,

709
01:00:19,753 --> 01:00:22,192
led by the young Max Devore.

710
01:00:23,534 --> 01:00:24,626
Oh, my God.

711
01:00:24,772 --> 01:00:26,857
Which would explain why...

712
01:00:27,894 --> 01:00:29,783
Lance got interested in her music

713
01:00:29,938 --> 01:00:31,549
before he tried to kill Kyra.

714
01:00:33,983 --> 01:00:34,848
Tell me.

715
01:00:37,858 --> 01:00:38,722
A curse...

716
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:43,344
On all the young men who killed
Sara Tidwell and her little girl.

717
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:46,906
With her dying breath,

718
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:49,347
she cursed them all.

719
01:00:51,791 --> 01:00:54,487
If they or any of their
descendants had daughters...

720
01:00:56,453 --> 01:01:00,146
They would do the same horrible
things to their little girls

721
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:02,835
that they had done to Sara Tidwell

722
01:01:02,923 --> 01:01:04,759
and her little girl.

723
01:01:04,767 --> 01:01:08,305
Their descendants included
Buddy Jellison

724
01:01:08,397 --> 01:01:10,788
and Bill Dean's fathers.

725
01:01:13,884 --> 01:01:16,117
That explains why they drowned
their daughters

726
01:01:16,143 --> 01:01:18,259
all those years later.

727
01:01:18,278 --> 01:01:22,195
One of that group was
my grandfather, Harold Noonan...

728
01:01:22,259 --> 01:01:24,978
No!
Please.

729
01:01:25,013 --> 01:01:28,732
Who willed the lake house
to Jo and myself.

730
01:01:30,429 --> 01:01:33,090
Did your father murder your sister?

731
01:01:33,124 --> 01:01:34,901
- No, no, no,
I-I didn't have any sisters.

732
01:01:34,907 --> 01:01:37,259
There was just Sid and me.

733
01:01:42,849 --> 01:01:45,682
Oh, my God, Mike, don't you see?

734
01:01:45,751 --> 01:01:47,643
This is the final piece of the puzzle.

735
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:50,426
This is why Jo didn't want
to tell you she was pregnant.

736
01:01:51,241 --> 01:01:52,982
Jo had learned of the curse.

737
01:01:52,983 --> 01:01:54,723
That's why she had all
those library books.

738
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:58,301
That's why she had Sara Tidwell's
albums and... and photographs.

739
01:01:58,938 --> 01:02:01,617
It's why she went to see
that man in the rest home.

740
01:02:02,126 --> 01:02:03,942
That's why she used to visit Dark Score

741
01:02:03,943 --> 01:02:05,758
lake all those weekends
before she died.

742
01:02:05,836 --> 01:02:07,483
She wasn't having an affair.

743
01:02:08,343 --> 01:02:10,303
She was researching Sara Tidwell.

744
01:02:11,381 --> 01:02:14,358
Mike... when she thought
she might be pregnant,

745
01:02:14,517 --> 01:02:16,970
- she was worried about you.
- Worried about me?

746
01:02:16,988 --> 01:02:19,565
Worried that you might be
bound to this curse by blood.

747
01:02:29,932 --> 01:02:30,871
Thank you.

748
01:02:36,963 --> 01:02:37,635
Thank you.

749
01:02:43,418 --> 01:02:46,456
I just don't want to doubt Jo anymore.

750
01:02:48,456 --> 01:02:49,808
I just don't want to doubt her.

751
01:03:07,746 --> 01:03:10,133
No, Mattie.

752
01:03:11,105 --> 01:03:11,807
Oh, Mattie.

753
01:03:12,632 --> 01:03:14,038
No, no.

754
01:03:15,646 --> 01:03:16,609
Oh, no.

755
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:21,478
Oh, God.

756
01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:24,231
Mattie, hey, I'm here.

757
01:03:24,813 --> 01:03:26,998
I'm here.
Don't... come on.

758
01:03:27,066 --> 01:03:29,725
- T-take care of my baby.

759
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:31,408
I will.

760
01:03:31,816 --> 01:03:33,996
I will, Mattie.
I'll take care of Kyra.

761
01:03:34,158 --> 01:03:36,145
I promise you,
no one's going to hurt her.

762
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:38,259
No one's going to hurt her, okay?

763
01:03:39,572 --> 01:03:40,129
Mattie...

764
01:03:41,242 --> 01:03:42,024
No!

765
01:04:05,312 --> 01:04:08,328
I see you!

766
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:10,911
I see you!

767
01:04:14,462 --> 01:04:17,261
Why?

768
01:04:17,325 --> 01:04:19,097
You killed her!

769
01:04:19,158 --> 01:04:21,093
You killed her!

770
01:04:21,124 --> 01:04:23,432
Why?
Why did you kill her?

771
01:04:23,465 --> 01:04:24,758
You should have left
well enough alone!

772
01:04:24,794 --> 01:04:26,712
This thing was always bigger...

773
01:04:26,764 --> 01:04:28,605
Bigger than Devore even.
Yeah?

774
01:04:28,644 --> 01:04:32,567
And now we need to take care of Kyra.

775
01:04:32,636 --> 01:04:34,440
"We" do?
Yeah.

776
01:04:46,915 --> 01:04:48,425
What's happening, Mike?

777
01:04:48,438 --> 01:04:49,502
We got to go, Ky...

778
01:04:49,759 --> 01:04:53,202
- Now.
- Mommy's dead, isn't she?

779
01:04:53,568 --> 01:04:54,541
Yes.

780
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:00,567
Come, come, now.
Now, let's go.

781
01:05:40,711 --> 01:05:42,088
How could you do this?

782
01:05:42,509 --> 01:05:44,153
It's the sins of the father, Mike.

783
01:05:44,187 --> 01:05:46,322
I told you to keep away from Devore.

784
01:05:48,024 --> 01:05:51,155
Devore is dead.
You can stop this now.

785
01:05:51,368 --> 01:05:54,793
No, this will only stop when
the last little girl is dead.

786
01:05:55,139 --> 01:05:58,280
Kyra Devore is the last descendant
with the blood of the curse.

787
01:06:00,905 --> 01:06:03,376
Custody has its responsibilities!

788
01:06:03,395 --> 01:06:06,458
You're telling me he wanted
custody so he could kill her?

789
01:06:06,611 --> 01:06:07,699
Is that what you're saying?

790
01:06:09,082 --> 01:06:10,589
Go to hell, both of you.

791
01:06:17,023 --> 01:06:19,123
I'm scared, Mike.

792
01:07:15,537 --> 01:07:16,551
All right, sweetheart.

793
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:18,652
Come on in.
Sit down here.

794
01:07:19,390 --> 01:07:22,171
Okay, let me just put
this towel around you.

795
01:07:23,197 --> 01:07:24,425
Let's get you dry.

796
01:07:24,475 --> 01:07:26,013
There we go.
Ooh.

797
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:28,053
How about this bath?

798
01:07:54,769 --> 01:07:55,212
Ah!

799
01:08:02,266 --> 01:08:04,581
Come on, let's get you
out of these wet clothes.

800
01:08:05,069 --> 01:08:06,151
There's a good girl.

801
01:08:06,918 --> 01:08:07,533
Come on.

802
01:08:12,037 --> 01:08:13,275
Here we go, my little angel.

803
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:14,894
Just lie down there.

804
01:08:15,277 --> 01:08:16,502
Here, let me take this towel.

805
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:18,122
There's a good girl.

806
01:08:18,184 --> 01:08:19,932
Okay, all right.

807
01:08:24,248 --> 01:08:26,706
Let me see if I've got
something that's good

808
01:08:26,738 --> 01:08:28,876
for a six-year-old girl.

809
01:08:28,878 --> 01:08:31,190
Okay.

810
01:08:31,208 --> 01:08:33,491
Here's a t-shirt.

811
01:08:33,493 --> 01:08:37,466
It's a little bit big, but...

812
01:08:39,231 --> 01:08:41,221
Here you go.

813
01:08:43,677 --> 01:08:47,936
All right, and, uh...
I'll just...

814
01:08:47,998 --> 01:08:49,396
I'll just put this there.

815
01:08:55,415 --> 01:08:56,509


816
01:08:56,853 --> 01:09:01,200
 and the blame all lies on him 

817
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:02,840


818
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:19,036
 and she lost her name again 

819
01:09:19,052 --> 01:09:20,652


820
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:25,713
finish it, daddy.

821
01:09:26,219 --> 01:09:29,564
Finish it, daddy.
Finish it, daddy.

822
01:09:29,756 --> 01:09:32,660
Finish it, daddy.
Finish it, daddy.

823
01:09:32,995 --> 01:09:36,073
Finish it, daddy.
Finish it, daddy.

824
01:09:36,916 --> 01:09:39,420
Finish it, daddy.
Finish it, daddy.

825
01:09:40,137 --> 01:09:41,331
Finish it, daddy.

826
01:09:55,854 --> 01:09:57,220
Oh, God!

827
01:09:57,328 --> 01:10:00,365
Custody has its responsibility!

828
01:10:00,519 --> 01:10:04,323
Now, you go and bring
that whorelet over here

829
01:10:04,999 --> 01:10:08,732
and stick her in the water
where she belongs.

830
01:10:08,915 --> 01:10:09,540
No!

831
01:10:10,371 --> 01:10:12,269
You can't make me do this!

832
01:10:14,807 --> 01:10:16,279
Finish it, daddy.

833
01:10:22,594 --> 01:10:26,196
Lie still, bag of bones.

834
01:10:35,459 --> 01:10:36,632
Where are you, Jo?

835
01:10:39,107 --> 01:10:39,790
Come on.

836
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:44,749
Lie still, bag of bones.

837
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:52,326
Is that what you are, Jo?

838
01:10:53,165 --> 01:10:54,894
Is that where
you've been hiding all along...

839
01:10:56,121 --> 01:10:57,424
Inside my writing?

840
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:05,838
"Down left side."

841
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:09,191
"Down left side."

842
01:11:10,919 --> 01:11:13,273
Well, if you've been hiding
inside my writing, then...

843
01:11:15,182 --> 01:11:16,679
"Down left side"?

844
01:11:19,538 --> 01:11:25,454
"Owls...Above...
Studio."

845
01:11:26,964 --> 01:11:28,387
"Owls above studio."

846
01:11:30,817 --> 01:11:32,788
So that's why you wanted me
to write, Jo.

847
01:11:33,463 --> 01:11:35,692
So you could send me messages
without Sara knowing...

848
01:11:36,833 --> 01:11:38,944
Messages behind the gatekeeper's back.

849
01:11:42,695 --> 01:11:44,183
"Lie still,
bag of bones."

850
01:11:51,443 --> 01:11:52,143
"Lye..."

851
01:11:57,488 --> 01:11:58,254
Lye.

852
01:12:11,356 --> 01:12:15,189
Lye will still her bag of bones.

853
01:12:18,666 --> 01:12:19,791
Owls in the studio.

854
01:12:45,035 --> 01:12:46,098
Lye...

855
01:12:47,042 --> 01:12:49,011
Will still her bag of bones.

856
01:12:51,653 --> 01:12:54,504
You hadn't figured out where those
bones were before you died...

857
01:12:58,190 --> 01:13:00,009
Or you would have done this
yourself, wouldn't you?

858
01:13:00,716 --> 01:13:01,567
Huh?

859
01:13:06,764 --> 01:13:07,579
Come on.

860
01:13:28,005 --> 01:13:29,261
The green lady.

861
01:13:47,567 --> 01:13:48,404
Finish it.

862
01:14:19,227 --> 01:14:19,911
Aah!

863
01:14:34,203 --> 01:14:38,246
I am so sorry what they did
to you and your daughter, Sara.

864
01:14:41,078 --> 01:14:46,034
I am so sorry what they did
to you and your daughter, Sara.

865
01:15:03,935 --> 01:15:06,085
Leave him alone!

866
01:15:10,350 --> 01:15:12,278
His blood is cursed.

867
01:15:12,454 --> 01:15:16,492
And Devore was the worst of them.
And his blood is in that little girl.

868
01:15:16,493 --> 01:15:17,857
And I won't rest

869
01:15:18,330 --> 01:15:21,918
until she is dead at his hands.

870
01:15:21,919 --> 01:15:24,838
Mike and Kyra
had nothing to do with this.

871
01:15:25,207 --> 01:15:28,580
Their kin killed my baby!

872
01:16:30,421 --> 01:16:31,196
We did it, Jo.

873
01:16:36,722 --> 01:16:37,428
You did it.

874
01:16:40,184 --> 01:16:42,249
I love you.

875
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:44,519
I love you.

876
01:16:48,863 --> 01:16:49,851
I love you.

877
01:17:27,631 --> 01:17:28,317
Kyra?

878
01:17:35,093 --> 01:17:36,100
What are you doing, Kyra?

879
01:17:36,404 --> 01:17:38,488
What the lady tells me to do.

880
01:17:38,505 --> 01:17:41,977
No, no, no, no, honey.
They're at rest now.

881
01:17:42,404 --> 01:17:44,942
Sara and Kisha
are at rest, sweetheart.

882
01:17:45,232 --> 01:17:46,397
Not Sara.

883
01:17:47,076 --> 01:17:47,913
Her.

884
01:17:49,933 --> 01:17:50,538
Who?

885
01:17:53,045 --> 01:17:54,662
We do not lose,
Mr. Noonan.

886
01:17:54,672 --> 01:17:57,323
Max Devore does not lose.

887
01:18:27,987 --> 01:18:29,680
Kyra, turn away!

888
01:18:50,063 --> 01:18:53,090
Oh, shh.
Shh.

889
01:18:53,187 --> 01:18:55,071
Shh, child.
Shh.

890
01:18:55,572 --> 01:18:57,237
It's over, baby girl.

891
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:59,049
Oh, sweet child.

892
01:18:59,424 --> 01:19:00,999
No, no.

893
01:19:18,942 --> 01:19:21,313
Come, now, baby girl, don't cry.

894
01:19:46,087 --> 01:19:47,013
Bye, mommy.

895
01:19:54,984 --> 01:19:56,775
Oh, my sweet child.

896
01:19:57,109 --> 01:19:58,610
Come on.
Come on.

897
01:19:58,778 --> 01:20:00,075
Come on.

898
01:20:00,990 --> 01:20:02,290
Oh.

899
01:20:08,986 --> 01:20:11,038
Oh, no.
Oh, darling.

900
01:20:11,639 --> 01:20:14,853
We're transporting now could
you prepare the report, please?

901
01:20:31,462 --> 01:20:32,936
Hey...

902
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:46,029
What did mommy tell you when
she whispered in your ear?

903
01:20:48,956 --> 01:20:50,682
She told me to be a good girl

904
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:52,909
and not to be sad.

905
01:20:55,141 --> 01:20:58,136
But I am sad.

906
01:21:00,892 --> 01:21:01,529
I know.

907
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:04,924
And that's okay.

908
01:21:07,153 --> 01:21:08,156
I'm sad, too.

909
01:21:11,253 --> 01:21:13,886
But we'll be okay, I promise you.

910
01:21:15,073 --> 01:21:16,113
I promise you.

911
01:21:17,528 --> 01:21:18,369
I know.

912
01:21:20,958 --> 01:21:21,709
You do?

913
01:21:22,358 --> 01:21:23,137
- Mm-hmm.

914
01:21:24,949 --> 01:21:26,088
Mommy told me.

915
01:21:27,339 --> 01:21:29,269
She said I was your little girl now

916
01:21:30,186 --> 01:21:32,338
and that you're gonna take care of me.

917
01:21:33,559 --> 01:21:34,784
Did she, now?

918
01:21:37,047 --> 01:21:39,720
She told me you're ready
to be a daddy now.

919
01:21:42,997 --> 01:21:44,310
Oh, come here.

920
01:21:46,053 --> 01:21:46,783
Yeah.

921
01:21:48,139 --> 01:21:48,949
Yes.

922
01:21:56,676 --> 01:21:57,377
Yeah.

923
01:22:01,252 --> 01:22:03,000
Should we go for a paddle
in the canoe?

924
01:22:04,129 --> 01:22:04,818
- Mm-hmm.

925
01:22:05,444 --> 01:22:06,133
Should we do that?

926
01:22:07,148 --> 01:22:08,993
- Go up the river.
- Yeah.

927
01:22:09,019 --> 01:22:10,513
Yeah.
Have an adventure.

928
01:22:11,609 --> 01:22:13,104
I think it's a good idea.
Let's go.

929
01:22:15,050 --> 01:22:17,678
Come on.
You need a piggyback.

930
01:22:17,836 --> 01:22:18,717
Piggyback.
Okay.

931
