Back in the early '20s,

132
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:13,078
The very first
talking cartoon was 1928,

133
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,247
was Paul Terry's "Dinner Time"

134
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:20,285
and he preceded Walt Disney's
"Steamboat Willy" by a month.

135
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:22,454
What happened was Walt
heard about,

136
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:25,857
"The Jazz Singer" came out
so there's sound.

137
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:28,393
Walt said, "We can take
this technology",

138
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,329
and make a sound movie,"
so they did.

139
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:32,264
Mickey didn't really
have a voice in--

140
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:34,733
in that early movie,
he just whistled

141
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:36,135
and the rest of it
was sound effects

142
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:37,336
and music effects.

143
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:39,638
But soon he could talk.

144
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,441
And then when he decided
to do features

145
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:44,543
and the first feature,
"Snow White" was called

146
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:46,645
Disney's folly, nobody
thought it would succeed.

147
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:48,113
But when he started
doing features,

148
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:50,148
and even before that when
he was casting voices

149
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,752
for the short films,
they were using radio talent.

150
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:55,487
Those are the great voices.

151
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:58,223

even though there was
nothing to see there.

156
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:09,501
The radio not only prepped me,

Radio is-- is very much

165
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,288
like an animation session.

166
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,124
You just borrow from whatever--

167
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:35,827
whatever experience you've
had as the radio actor

168
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:37,295
or animation person.

169
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:38,830
It all seems to work out.

170
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:40,766
Back in the days
of old time radio,

171
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:44,302
as they call it now, that was
essentially voice acting.

172
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:46,605
Strangely enough
when you do a cartoon

173
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:48,073
and they edit it all together

174
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,641
and get it ready
for the animators to animate,

175
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:51,643
they call it "the radio show."

176
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:52,145
♪

177
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,555
My first real gig was
being dropped on my head

178
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:05,123
in a church which
rendered my relationship

179
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,858
to the deity problematic.

180
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,860
The first one I ever did
where I went,

181
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:10,562
"Wow, these people
are reacting,

182
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:14,599
like, as if I was a baby
speaking my first words"

183
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,468
was Peter Falk, was "Columbo."

184
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,136
I'd seen "Columbo"
the night before

185
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:21,039
and my teacher, Mr. Fraser,
was doing it in the schoolyard

186
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:25,010
for a bunch of my schoolmates,
and I don't know how I did it,

187
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:27,579
but I just went up to him
and said, "Mr. Fraser, Sir",

188
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:28,814
I'm sorry to bother you.

189
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:31,983
This is,
this is very embarrassing.

190
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:34,753
"You're murdering
a Peter Falk impression."

191
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:36,254
And the eye went and everything

192
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:40,292
and I just, I discovered
I could do something well.

193
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,827
I remember I was 10 years old

194
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:43,495
and there was this woman,
Phyllis, who was running

195
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:45,298
the front desk
at Lee Strasberg.

196
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:46,965
And she was so funny with me.

197
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,967
I'd be at the 7/11
across the street

198
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,069
and she'd, you know,
run across and say,

199
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:53,338
"Alanna, I know you
across the street"

200
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,906
smoking marijuana
with the homeless.

201
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:56,575
You get your ass
over here right now

202
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:58,043
"and you learn how to act."

203
00:07:58,045 --> 00:07:59,478
And then the phone would ring
and she'd say,

204
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,612
"Lee Strasberg Theater
Institute,

205
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:01,947
may I help you, please?"

206
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,782
I never forgot that.

207
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:05,317
My parents are
from Buenos Aires

208
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:08,854
[speaking Spanish]

209
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:10,021
I can hear it.

210
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,456
And then my other,
my best friend's parents

211
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,858
were from Glasgow, Scotland,

212
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,794
so if I wasn't listening
to [speaking Spanish]

213
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:17,028
I was listening to
"Carlos and Kevin,

214
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,498
get outside for Pete's sake."

215
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,900
So right there I had
an early influence

216
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:24,102
of wanting to imitate people.

217
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:26,505
I always was doing voices
from the time

218
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,173
I was really small.

219
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,575
Um, my mom did
cartoon voices at me, like,

220
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:32,544
you know, she would talk
like a little baby,

221
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:34,279
"What are you doing
over there?"

222
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:35,680
And so I would
talk back to her.

223
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,015
And people would say,
"She's never gonna learn

224
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,884
how to talk normally
if you keep doing that."

225
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:41,686
I knew about voiceovers
when I was little.

226
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,622
I did like, you know,
Burger King commercials

227
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:44,956
and stuff like that.

228
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,092
And then it wasn't
until later um,

229
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:50,629
that I discovered
that I could marry the two

230
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:54,900
with, you know, acting and
voiceovers, animation.

231
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:57,135
If you wanna do animation,
you have to be in LA.

232
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,037
This is the animation
capital of the world.

233
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,607
This is in every single
biography you ever hear.

234
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:06,811
Broke, lonely,
and no future in sight,

235
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:09,314
fame was right around
the corner.

236
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:10,682
And then they go to commercial,

237
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:12,317
then we come back
and they're famous.

238
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:13,652
Wait a minute!

239
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:16,121
I wanna know what they did
those mornings

240
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:18,056
when they couldn't
get out of bed.

241
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,791
What did you do then?

242
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,059
What did you do then?

243
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,761
I keep having
this recurring dream,

244
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:24,696
same thing, that I'm walking
down the street

245
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:26,164
and it says "fame"
and as I get closer

246
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,533
the street just keeps
getting longer and longer

247
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:32,037
and further away from me.

248
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:34,606
Just know that it's
a profession.

249
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:36,207
It needs to be taken seriously.

250
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:38,243
You gotta, you know,
have fun and never grow up,

251
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,845
but at the same time
you gotta really be where

252
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:43,081
the major markets are
and you need to have

253
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,249
access to the material.

254
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,551
And there's no right
or wrong way to do that,

255
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:47,953
it's your own journey.

256
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:50,288
You can't use
someone else's journey.

257
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,556
It's your own thing.

258
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:53,992
I slept my way
to the top, you know?

259
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:59,464
It's rampant
in this business, you know?

260
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,232
Before you move
to the big market

261
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:04,169
I think it's wise to
build up two things:

262
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:07,973
You need to build up your
well-deserved confidence

263
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:10,342
by doing professional
live performing

264
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:11,643
of whatever kind you want.

265
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:12,911
The other thing
that you gotta have

266
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:14,846
is you also have to
earn your armor.

267
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:17,882
You have to have uh,
a degree of armor to deal

268
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:19,517
with all of the rejection
that you're going to get

269
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,819
as an actor.

270
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:22,654
It's a huge commitment
to pursue

271
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:24,322
anything in the arts.

272
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:25,857
First thing I tell people is,

273
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,626
'cause everyone
will say, you know,

274
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,060
"I think I can
make some money at this."

275
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:31,329
Never do anything
in this business for money.

276
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:33,798
Gotta do it because you get
a high at the microphone.

277
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,800
I took voiceover classes.

278
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:39,070
My animation guru, I mean,
off and on for 10 years

279
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,372
was Daws Butler.

280
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:43,575
The revolving door of talent
in Daws' class,

281
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:46,611
Nancy Cartwright, Corey Burton,

282
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,313
Greg Burson, Mona Marshall.

283
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:49,648
Daws.

284
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,782
I mean, he was brilliant.

285
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:52,183
When you look at
a piece of copy,

286
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:53,952
he was talking
commercial copy, of course,

287
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,854
you have to really,
even if it's a line or two

288
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:57,789
you have to be able
to pick it up and see

289
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,491
"What is this character?
Who is she?

290
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:00,625
What's the frame of reference?"

291
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:02,460
Okay, look at that
piece of copy.

292
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:04,029
Who's that speaking?

293
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:07,098
So, perhaps, if she's
a woman of elegance,

294
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,967
you know, you might have
some of that oral

295
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:10,101
happening there.

296
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:13,438
And if uh, you know,
she's really tight assed

297
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,839
you might have
a little bit more

298
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,975
of an oral nasal.

299
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:19,144
Then, you know combination
of that well it'll

300
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:21,279
then get you into
being, you know,

301
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:24,482
maybe somebody
who's kind of shy.

302
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:26,885
Project bad tidings.

303
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:28,286
Obviously it's the first step

304
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:31,556
to a successful career
in voiceover is you go

305
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:32,857
right to the steel mill.

306
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,159
You know, as soon as you're 18

307
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:36,428
you get a job on a blast
furnace, which I did.

308
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,996
And then I went to New Orleans

309
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:40,765
and uh, took the precaution
of becoming a deck hand

310
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:44,002
on a riverboat
which is another, I mean, duh,

311
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:46,771
cliché, you know,
it's how you prepare.

312
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:49,174
And sell encyclopedias
and do Mardi Gras floats

313
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:50,308
and what else?

314
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,711
Sing in a rock
and roll band and uh,

315
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:54,179
it's all the stuff
that used to get

316
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:55,747
me kicked out of class
and it's great.

317
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:58,383
One of the first things
that I did was um,

318
00:11:58,385 --> 00:11:59,984
"Back to the Future:
The Animated Series."

319
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:01,453
I'm pretty sure
that I got that part

320
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:04,022
'cause I was the only kid
at nine that could say

321
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:05,825
"I'm computing
the logarithmic equivalents"

322
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:07,926
of the atomic weights
of certain isotopes found

323
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:10,161
"in the lanthonite series
of rare earth elements."

324
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:12,430
So I kept it around,
never letting it

325
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:13,665
out of my sight.

326
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,266
Where is it, dammit?

327
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:16,768
Quit goofing off!

328
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,037
You may be asleep,
but you're not on break!

329
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,807
One of my friends
was listening to WBCN FM

330
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:24,309
and they did a lot
of wacky things

331
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:26,277
and they were having a contest
to who could sound

332
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,512
like Mel Blanc.

333
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:30,315
So I kind of sheepishly called

334
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:33,952
and they go, "Hello, BCN,
you sound like Mel Blanc."

335
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:36,488
And I--and I didn't
know what to do.

336
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,356
I was put right on the spot.

337
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:41,893
And I was like, "Um" click.

338
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:44,195
And I said,
"I'm gonna call 'em back."

339
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:46,131
And uh, so I get 'em
on the phone,

340
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:47,832
I got busy and busy
and then I was like,

341
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:49,901
even getting angrier
and I just let 'em have it

342
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:51,836
once he said, "Hello, you
sound like Mel Blanc"

343
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:57,575
and I was like
"What do you think, idiot?"

344
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:59,778
And, "Of course I do, doc."

345
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,513
You know, and,
"You're despicable if

346
00:13:01,515 --> 00:13:03,414
you don't put me on the air."

347
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:07,118
You know, just all junk
like that and he went,

348
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,453
"Hold on."

349
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,288
Next thing you know
I was on the radio.

350
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:14,058
They called me and said,
"We would like you to play

351
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,361
SpongeBob SquarePants'
grandma."

352
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:19,564
Well, I thought that was--
that was a good idea.

353
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:24,402
I had no idea
how important that was.

354
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,971
It turns out to be one of
my best credits.

355
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,840
You know, you can mention
all these things,

356
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:30,475
nothing happens.

357
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:35,847
And so I mention that I'm
SpongeBob SquarePants' grandma,

358
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:36,981
all excited,
little children will

359
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,316
show me their underwear.

360
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,218
You know, as with many
people it was just

361
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,188
so many dominos
had to fall, you know,

362
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,390
and you have to find
a way in somehow

363
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:46,758
in some weird niche.

364
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,327
Walla is the voiceover
equivalent

365
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,029
of being an extra, essentially.

366
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:52,497
So they have four people,
generally,

367
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,299
they'll have two men
and two women,

368
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:57,168
then they'll come in
and they'll do, you know,

369
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,870
this background kind of thing--

370
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:02,440
[muttering]

371
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:05,476
So I did that, that was my
very first animation gig.

372
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:08,746
Actually got into animation
by being a designer.

373
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:11,683
And one day I happened to go
to the recording session.

374
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:12,984
And in about
two seconds I went,

375
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:15,553
"Oh, no, no, no,
this is the job.

376
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:16,888
This is the job you want."

377
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:20,558
Hi, I'm Ed Asner.

378
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,329
I love to act, I don't care
what form it takes.

379
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:29,167
Be it improv,
voiceover, narration,

380
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:33,771
anything that requires
my pretending to be

381
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:36,908
someone else I leap at.

382
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,810
To be a good voice actor

383
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:41,279
you have to be
an actor, that's all.

384
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:44,048
I think you're born
with that talent.

385
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,484
You can't teach anybody to act.

386
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:50,555
You can, you can teach them
techniques of getting closer,

387
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:55,059
or whispering,
but it comes from the heart.

388
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,828
The good voice actors
are so good

389
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,898
the cartoons don't even
have to be that good.

390
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,066
I gotta tell ya,
that's the sad truth.

391
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,202
When you get started,
when you really start,

392
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:06,471
start listening to what people

393
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:08,006
are actually doing.

394
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:10,141
A lot of actors get into it
and they don't know

395
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,176
how to act for voiceover.

396
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:14,279
It's a very different
style of acting.

397
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:16,347
It's much bigger,
it's much more theatrical.

398
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:20,351
It is not about I can say,
"Eh, what's up, doc"

399
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:22,120
better than anybody else,
you know, no.

400
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:24,923
It's can you read anything
as that character,

401
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,958
can you become that character.

402
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,027
It's about hearing
all those little voices

403
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:30,561
in your head beforehand.

404
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:32,497
When you look at a script
and you have to give an A,

405
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:33,965
a B, and a C take.

406
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:35,833
When you look at a script
you have to give an A,

407
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:37,302
a B, and a C take.

408
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:39,938
When you look at a script
you have to give an A,

409
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,139
a B, and a C take.

410
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:42,807
All of 'em have
to be different.

411
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:45,977
Voiceover's about creating
characters who may be funny

412
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:48,179
or may be dramatic,
or may be scary or whatever.

413
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:50,214
It's the same as acting
it's just you don't have

414
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:51,349
to get up at six o'clock
in the morning,

415
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:53,084
which is why I'm interested.

416
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:53,586
♪

417
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,358
Even before I knew
it was Mel Blanc,

418
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,193
I would have told you
it was Bugs Bunny

419
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:05,330
was my hero and then,
and Daffy Duck

420
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:09,033
and Foghorn Leghorn,
I really loved Foghorn Leghorn.

421
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:11,636
I didn't know who I was
listening to back then

422
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,037
except for guys like Mel Blanc.

423
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,138
- Mel Blanc.
- Mel Blanc.

424
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,340
- Mel Blanc.
- Mel Blanc.

425
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:16,507
Mel Blanc.

426
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,543
Mel Blanc, of course,
is the name you have

427
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:21,112
to kind of throw out first
because he lit the way

428
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:22,880
for just about everybody else.

429
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:24,749
I remember what really
astonished me was

430
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:26,617
that Mel Blanc did everything.

431
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:28,353
That's what I thought
was pretty magical,

432
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:31,189
was that Roadrunner,
and Tweety, Wile E. Coyote,

433
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:34,525
and Bugs, and Daffy,
and Elmer Fudd.

434
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:35,827
You break down the voice.

435
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,862
It's New Yorky, it's nasally,

436
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:39,163
and he's a smart aleck.

437
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,432
That could be such
an unappealing voice

438
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:44,769
and yet endearing,
timelessly endearing.

439
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:47,538
Well, he told me that he was
a tough little stinker.

440
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,707
So I thought maybe Brooklyn
or the Bronx.

441
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:51,376
So I uh, put the two of them
together, doc,

442
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:53,644
that's how I got
the voice for Bugs.

443
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:57,415
In the episode uh,
"Wabbit Season, Duck Season",

444
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,317
that episode of Bugs Bunny
where they're sort of

445
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:01,953
arguing as to which season it is
and who Elmer should shoot.

446
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:04,222
Bugs come out dressed as Daffy

447
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:06,057
and Bugs does
a Daffy impression

448
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,925
and then Daffy comes out
dressed as Bugs

449
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:10,128
and does a Bugs impression.

450
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,930
And they're,
they're different voices.

451
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:15,099
One sounds like Bugs
trying to be Daffy

452
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:17,969
and the other sounds
like Daffy trying to be Bugs,

453
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:20,538
and that's-- it's unbelievably

454
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,006
impossibly hard to do.

455
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:25,843
Basically it was Bugs Bunny
stepping in to do

456
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:27,378
an imitation of Daffy Duck.

457
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,548
It wasn't Mel Blanc
doing Bugs and then Daffy.

458
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,784
In fact I remember Lou Costello
writing on a picture,

459
00:17:32,786 --> 00:17:35,053
it says "To my favorite actor."

460
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:37,422
So Mel actually
was a great actor,

461
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:39,524
and that's why he was so good

462
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:40,591
in all the characters.

463
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:42,727
He was a method actor.

464
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,262
He became the characters.

465
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:46,230
I was going to
a recording session

466
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:50,401
and we were waiting
for Mel and he's usually

467
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,736
right on time.

468
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:55,406
And I turned on the radio,
they said "Mel Blanc",

469
00:17:55,408 --> 00:18:00,278
the famous voice,
had a terrible auto accident."

470
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,447
He was in a coma
for about 14 days.

471
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:04,315
And the doctor got an idea
and he went over to Mel

472
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:08,286
and clapped his hands and said,
"Mel, can you hear me?

473
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:09,921
Can you hear me, Mel?"

474
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,523
And Bugs Bunny was on the air.

475
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:14,625
And he-- it didn't do anything

476
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:17,161
and so the doctor
thought "Bugs."

477
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:19,330
So he said,
"Bugs, can you hear me?"

478
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:21,966
And Mel goes,
"Eh, what's up, doc?"

479
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:23,634
He said, "Porky,
can you hear me?"

480
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,636
"I c-c-can hear."

481
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:29,207
So he came out of the coma
doing the voices.

482
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:31,676
The characters
saved Mel's life.

483
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:34,345
He was in the hospital
and so they wanted me

484
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:37,315
to take his place
at Warner Brothers Cartoons,

485
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:39,250
and I said, "No,
I don't wanna do that."

486
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:40,518
Wait'll Mel comes back."

487
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:45,056
He broke practically
every bone in his body.

488
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:49,360
And so he would record
at his home,

489
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:53,965
and I would go to his home
in Pacific Palisades

490
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:56,067
and we'd record there.

491
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:58,669
June Foray is
Rocky the Flying Squirrel,

492
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:00,705
Rocket J. Squirrel,
from "Bullwinkle and Rocky."

493
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:04,675
Hokey smoke, they remember
Rocky the Flying Squirrel.

494
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:06,377
She's Natasha Fatale.

495
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:08,312
Of course Natasha, darling.

496
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:11,983
When you trace her back,
she was on, like,

497
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,484
back in the '40s.

498
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:17,121
She's 90 plus years old now
and still working.

499
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:18,689
And still working.

500
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:24,629
So I started with Granny,
oh, it was like, 1956

501
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:28,633
that I started with Granny,
and I'm still doing it.

502
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:31,369
♪

503
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:34,605
Approaching a legacy voice
it uh, it can depend.

504
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:37,508
It'll depend on who's
running the show.

505
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,378
Kinda have to have an ear
for do they sound the same,

506
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,346
is it the same,
is on the same timbre?

507
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,649
Um, but then from there,
can they actually

508
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:46,317
deliver the performance?

509
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,919
There's much more
to a character

510
00:19:47,921 --> 00:19:49,220
than just the voice.

511
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:51,088
Eh, what's up, doc?

512
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:54,192
Of course, you all know Goofy.

513
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:56,327
Marvin the Martian
from the Loony Tunes show,

514
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:58,362
isn't that lovely?

515
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,897
Sir, how dare you?

516
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:02,700
I used to do, like,
a Winnie the Pooh for my kids.

517
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:06,337
Oh, it's a smackeral of honey.

518
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:07,939
And then Jim Cummings walks in,
you're like

519
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:10,441
"Oh, that's real good."

520
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:12,977
Job one, you gotta
sound like the guy.

521
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:14,078
You gotta do that right away.

522
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,613
And then you, then you dive in

523
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:17,816
and you get all the aspects
of the personality and--

524
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:20,651
but the first thing is
you have to go,

525
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:24,488
"Oh, that's Pooh Bear,"
or "That's Tigger."

526
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:28,726
He bounces, he bounces,
and he kicks!

527
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,095
All of this
not kicking the ball

528
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:33,965
has made me quite tired.

529
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:35,132
Count out the sounds.

530
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:36,567
Eh.

531
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:37,501
Eh buh.

532
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,636
Eh buh beh.

533
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:40,738
Eh buh beh eh boy, okay?

534
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,873
So it's four sounds
in the word.

535
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,275
E chch eh chair.

536
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:45,776
Eh dede eh desk.

537
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:49,347
Now you wrinkle your nose,
you make it kinda nasal.

538
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:50,948
Eh buh beh eh boy.

539
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,117
And then for the third sound
you push it more.

540
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,752
Eh beh beh eh boy.

541
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:55,953
Eh ch ch eh chair.

542
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:57,421
Eh de de eh desk.

543
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,290
Then you have to put together
full sentences.

544
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:00,958
The eh beh beh eh boy
sat in the eh ch ch eh chair

545
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,460
next to the eh de de eh desk.

546
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:03,794
And nobody can do that
and that's why

547
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:05,129
I have job security.

548
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:07,331
When I got the gig
as Fred Flintstone

549
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,267
I was the least likely
guy to get it.

550
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:11,736
Five foot four,
115 pounds soaking wet.

551
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:13,237
"Hi, I'm here to do
Fred Flintstone."

552
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,740
They literally looked over me.

553
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:17,141
Henry Corden, who was the voice

554
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:18,676
of Fred Flintstone,
he took over

555
00:21:18,678 --> 00:21:21,579
after Alan Reed passed away,
was there and he yelled

556
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:23,080
to the director "Would you stop"

557
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:25,349
looking at him
and just listen?"

558
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:27,852
And Henry Corden is,
you know, Fred Flintstone,

559
00:21:27,854 --> 00:21:29,320
was more nasal.

560
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:32,256
To the moon, Alice,
it was more Jackie Gleason.

561
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:35,626
Alan Reed was more,
Eh, Wilma, Barney,

562
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:38,429
it was smoother,
and oh brother.

563
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:40,331
So I tried to kinda
combine 'em both

564
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,566
and there you get
Fred Flintstone.

565
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:44,502
Every single actor
that's worked for me

566
00:21:44,504 --> 00:21:47,305
playing the Joker,
and there have been many,

567
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:48,973
brings their own twist to it.

568
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:50,174
And that's what you want.

569
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:51,942
You want someone to just
do Mark Hamill,

570
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:53,244
then you bring Mark Hamill in.

571
00:21:53,246 --> 00:21:55,680
Everybody sort of knows
the Joker here

572
00:21:55,682 --> 00:21:59,884
when he's up and exuberant.

573
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:02,386
You can't do it quietly.

574
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:06,590
Okay, here's how he laughs.

575
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,759
You have to really let it rip!

576
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:10,661
I always approached
each script like it was like

577
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,396
the first time
I'd ever done it.

578
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:14,298
I mean, there either had
to be continuity

579
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,467
that he had to be
exactly the same Joker,

580
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:18,803
and I figured he has
multiple personalities anyway.

581
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:21,839
There'd be the traditional
where he's wildly exuberant

582
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,175
and gleeful and maniacal,
and there'd be others

583
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:28,312
where uh, sort of much more
sinister and menacing.

584
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:30,648
I really love
all the other Jokers

585
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,616
except for
Kevin Michael Richardson.

586
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:34,785
I was feeling a bit screw loose

587
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:37,688
so I checked myself in.

588
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,590
[maniacal laugh]

589
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:41,559
And you know I'm kidding
because I love

590
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:43,227
Kevin Michael Richardson
so much,

591
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:45,363
he's a wonderful actor,
but I'm just jealous because

592
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:49,500
he got an Emmy nomination
and I never did.

593
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:50,868
I gotta give Mark props,
I don't want him coming

594
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,537
after me going,
"Did you really say that?"

595
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,873
'Cause I don't
think it's funny.

596
00:22:55,875 --> 00:23:00,544
"I was the best Joker, not you."

597
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,113
Mark never said that.

598
00:23:02,115 --> 00:23:07,585
Mark's Joker is broad and
terrifying at the same time.

599
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:09,420
Everybody who's ever
played the Joker since

600
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:11,856
really has tried to come up
to that benchmark,

601
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:13,657
and everybody brings
their own twist to it

602
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:15,092
and has their different thing.

603
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:16,694
The trick is for people not

604
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:18,129
to do an impression of Mark.

605
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:19,764
So um, you know, John DiMaggio

606
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:22,767
did a stunning version
in "Under the Red Hood."

607
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:26,537
That was completely different
and terrifying in its own right.

608
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:28,105
It was just
a very dark place, you know?

609
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:30,174
It's just allowing yourself
to go to that really,

610
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:31,609
really awful place in your mind

611
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:33,477
and everybody has one.

612
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:35,946
I tapped into it for that,
you know, vocally

613
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:38,416
and tried to make him
as evil as possible,

614
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:40,184
and it worked.

615
00:23:40,186 --> 00:23:41,552
Does anybody realize
how brilliant

616
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:44,054
these voiceover "actors" are?

617
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:45,990
Who are,
let's just call 'em actors

618
00:23:45,992 --> 00:23:48,926
because they have to get
every cryptic expression

619
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:52,296
that you would do on camera,
on mic.

620
00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:53,597
They're storytellers.

621
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,299
That's their gift.

622
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:59,437
And man, nobody gets it unless
you're sitting in my seat.

623
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:00,971
Actors wanna go,
"It's so easy!"

624
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:04,341
It's like, yeah,
it's easy for you

625
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:07,077
'cause all you gotta do
is read out loud

626
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,446
in your own voice.

627
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,214
You know, this--
there is a misconception,

628
00:24:10,216 --> 00:24:15,085
I think, that voice acting
is just "reading aloud."

629
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:16,020
And it's not.

630
00:24:16,022 --> 00:24:17,388
At the end of the day

631
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,023
it's two different job
descriptions.

632
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:21,926
Their job is to be
movie stars or TV stars

633
00:24:21,928 --> 00:24:24,662
and sound as much
like themselves as possible,

634
00:24:24,664 --> 00:24:26,931
and our job is to be
voice actors

635
00:24:26,933 --> 00:24:28,599
and character actors,
and sound as little

636
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:30,668
like ourselves
or as little like

637
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:35,239
the last thing you did
an hour ago as possible.

638
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:37,942
People find out what I do
and like,

639
00:24:37,944 --> 00:24:39,176
"I can do Donald Duck.

640
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:40,311
Do you want me
to do it for you?"

641
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:41,445
I'm like, "Please, don't."

642
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:43,414
It's my dentist or, you know,

643
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:45,049
it's the guy at the bank

644
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:46,884
and he's like, "I can do
the greatest Donald Duck"

645
00:24:46,886 --> 00:24:49,353
and I'm like,
"I will give you five dollars

646
00:24:49,355 --> 00:24:50,721
if you do not do that."

647
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:53,224
And I don't wanna be mean,
but the soul

648
00:24:53,226 --> 00:24:55,593
of this business is acting.

649
00:24:55,595 --> 00:24:59,763
And the voice, the funny voice
that they put on,

650
00:24:59,765 --> 00:25:01,065
if that's what
you wanna call it,

651
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:03,534
is secondary to the heart
of the character

652
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:04,536
that they develop.

653
00:25:04,537 --> 00:25:05,903
You always hear people like,

654
00:25:05,905 --> 00:25:09,106
"Hey, my friends say
I do great voices."

655
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:11,442
But they're not actors
and then they think, like,

656
00:25:11,444 --> 00:25:12,776
"Well, you guys
just go in there"

657
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:14,979
and like make a crazy voice

658
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:17,281
"and then you
get lots of money."

659
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:22,453
Like, no, we have to act
and then we get lots of money.

660
00:25:22,455 --> 00:25:24,088
And make a crazy voice.

661
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:26,290
But it's gotta have stuff
behind it.

662
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:28,926
So it's not about "I can do",

663
00:25:28,928 --> 00:25:30,995
I can do Christopher Walken,
I can do Johnny Depp,

664
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:34,465
"I can do Michael J. Fox,
I can do whoever," that's great.

665
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:35,900
Can you do anything as them

666
00:25:35,902 --> 00:25:37,935
and can you stay in
that voice for four hours?

667
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:40,337
Can you scream in
that voice for four hours?

668
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:43,641
Can you get electrocuted
as Michael J. Fox?

669
00:25:43,643 --> 00:25:45,376
Can you get punched
in the stomach

670
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:46,343
as Michael J. Fox?

671
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:47,912
If you can, great.

672
00:25:47,914 --> 00:25:50,247
And can you do it without
going, "Hang on",

673
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:52,983
wait a second,"
just right then.

674
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:54,752
Whenever I get an audition
for a new character

675
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:56,320
I'll look at the drawing
of the character.

676
00:25:56,322 --> 00:25:58,289
If they have a show bible
I'll read the show bible

677
00:25:58,291 --> 00:26:00,357
so it says, you know,
what city they're in,

678
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:02,927
what time it is,
maybe it's a different planet.

679
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:04,929
And all those factors
come into play.

680
00:26:04,931 --> 00:26:06,997
I don't necessarily
go into a role thinking

681
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:10,267
"Cartoon" I think,
"How would this being sound?"

682
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:12,369
It starts from the moment
you go in to audition,

683
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:14,872
when you look at the drawing,
when you see the script.

684
00:26:14,874 --> 00:26:17,207
And then you look
at the character and you see,

685
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:19,143
if it's a little girl,
how old is she?

686
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:22,079
You know, is she,
is she five years old?

687
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,180
Is she really tiny?

688
00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:24,615
'Cause then their equipment's

689
00:26:24,617 --> 00:26:27,251
gonna be little
itty bitty, right?

690
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:31,188
But if she's eight she,
her voice box is bigger,

691
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,324
she knows more,
she's a little more

692
00:26:33,326 --> 00:26:34,725
confident in the world.

693
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:37,995
For me it really starts
with the artwork.

694
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:39,496
I like to see a picture.

695
00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:41,298
I like to see, you know,
how tall, how short,

696
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,101
how heavy, how light,
you know, could be Skeeter,

697
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,970
you know, mighty skinny,
ain't got no teeth so he's

698
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:48,238
got a little bit of a whistle
in it when he talks.

699
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,308
Like with Tommy, like, he's
got these funny lips, right?

700
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:55,079
He's--he's got this big
kind of slurry sort of thing,

701
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:56,680
you know, he's got this thing.

702
00:26:56,682 --> 00:26:59,249
So when I first saw him
to me there was some

703
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:01,085
kind of speech thing.

704
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:04,521
I'm not really so sure about
what's going on around here,

705
00:27:04,523 --> 00:27:06,223
but uh, I guess it's okay.

706
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:08,792
You know, here's a picture,
here's where he lives,

707
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:11,295
this is, you know...

708
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:13,998
he's half a child,
half a man, you know,

709
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,033
kind of Peewee Herman,
a little bit of Stan Laurel,

710
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:18,969
a little bit of Jerry Lewis,
little bit of munchkin,

711
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:21,939
and uh, you know,
it's not really a kid voice

712
00:27:21,941 --> 00:27:24,642
like a Charlie Brown
realistic kid voice,

713
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:26,377
but it's not really
an adult either.

714
00:27:26,379 --> 00:27:27,845
So, you know,
if the character has

715
00:27:27,847 --> 00:27:29,113
really big buck teeth
you may do it differently

716
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:30,981
or if they have a very,
you know, big tongue

717
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,750
and they lisp a lot, you know,

718
00:27:32,752 --> 00:27:35,152
if there's a lot of spit
involved in the picture

719
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,154
then you may do
something different.

720
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:40,791
If you sound like you
have a large chest,

721
00:27:40,793 --> 00:27:45,462
they will animate you
with a very large chest.

722
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:47,965
Say that there's
a character and, you know,

723
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:49,867
he's a deep voiced character
and they want something

724
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:52,102
like a giant,
he's a giant and uh,

725
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:54,071
this is--
they want him like this,

726
00:27:54,073 --> 00:27:56,373
but, you know,
they wanna keep him bright

727
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:58,075
and they want it, you know,
they wanna have him

728
00:27:58,077 --> 00:27:59,209
very intelligent.

729
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:01,178
So, you know,
he's this kinda guy,

730
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,515
and you know, or maybe,
maybe he's got some tusks,

731
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:08,952
you know, so when you
put that in there or maybe,

732
00:28:08,954 --> 00:28:12,756
maybe he's not that bright
so maybe he

733
00:28:12,758 --> 00:28:16,026
would talk like this
a little bit.

734
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:19,263
That's the kind of thing
you're able to do

735
00:28:19,265 --> 00:28:20,564
with a character.

736
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:21,765
You ready, man?

737
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:24,168
Yeah, dude.

738
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,235
Put your pants on.

739
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:26,437
Okay.

740
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:29,039
On "Futurama" we didn't know

741
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,908
what Bender the robot
should sound like.

742
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,810
A robot, what, you know.

743
00:28:32,812 --> 00:28:35,079
'Cause the tendency
and what most people did

744
00:28:35,081 --> 00:28:36,747
when they came in,
"I am Bender,

745
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:38,282
I talk like a robot."

746
00:28:38,284 --> 00:28:41,318
You know, there was all that
and variations of that.

747
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,720
I auditioned for Bender.

748
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:44,855
I just played him like
a construction worker.

749
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:46,457
Let me just bend that for ya.

750
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:48,559
We were really going through
a lot of people and then,

751
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:52,196
then uh, somebody said,
"Hey, Dave, you sound"

752
00:28:52,198 --> 00:28:53,030
kinda like a robot.

753
00:28:53,032 --> 00:28:54,298
"Maybe you should do the part."

754
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,899
I chose to take that
as a compliment.

755
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:58,368
So he tried,
he tried, tried out.

756
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,503
No, no good.

757
00:28:59,505 --> 00:29:00,871
He agreed, no good.

758
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:03,607
Uh, and then Don--
John DiMaggio came in

759
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:05,809
and John did this, you know,

760
00:29:05,811 --> 00:29:11,115
kinda drunk, aggressive,
belligerent but not scary.

761
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:13,617
Just kind of over the top,
you know,

762
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:16,186
guy had one too many, right?

763
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:17,020
And that was it.

764
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:20,290
It just made us laugh so much.

765
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:21,492
Slim Pickens.

766
00:29:21,494 --> 00:29:24,294
What in the hell
in the wide, wide world

767
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:26,630
of sports is going on?

768
00:29:26,632 --> 00:29:29,166
The drunk at the end
of every bar.

769
00:29:29,168 --> 00:29:33,637
[slurring speech]

770
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:35,305
I'm gonna tell you something.

771
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:37,341
And then there was this guy,
a friend of mine,

772
00:29:37,343 --> 00:29:40,110
Ralph Columbino from college

773
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:42,212
did a Charlie
the Sausage Lover.

774
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:44,782
Sausage, [talking gibberish]
you got all kinds of sausages.

775
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:46,150
You got dry sausage,
you got sweet sausage,

776
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:47,885
you got wet sausage,
you got hot sausage.

777
00:29:47,887 --> 00:29:49,486
So I--you put those three
in a blender

778
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:51,088
and you get Bender.

779
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:51,722
Then I do this.

780
00:29:51,724 --> 00:29:53,190
Okay, sure.

781
00:29:53,192 --> 00:29:56,794
Thanks to you I went
on a soul searching journey.

782
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:57,928
I hate those.

783
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,863
Now give up the free will!

784
00:29:59,865 --> 00:30:01,665
Now hand it over.

785
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:02,866
You want it?

786
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:04,334
Come and get it.

787
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:06,036
Why you lousy--

788
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:10,440
In my mind that's the voice
that Bender should have had

789
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:13,844
and always w--but we didn't
know, we didn't know.

790
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:16,980
So John nailed the character
and actually pushed

791
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,749
the character
in that direction.

You know, Billy West

00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:27,090
and Jeff Bennett,
I always say they have

796
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:29,660
this Rolodex in their head
and they just flip through it

797

all these references.

800
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:42,472
Dr. Zoidberg who uh, when they
showed me the drawings,

801
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:45,209
he had all this cool meat
hanging off his mouth.

802
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:46,643
And I thought,
"Well, he's gotta be

803
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:47,878
impaired somehow."

804
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,813
And I thought
"What marble mouthed

805
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:53,984
peripheral actors
were there in history?"

806
00:30:53,986 --> 00:30:56,186
And I put two together,
one was a vaudevillian

807
00:30:56,188 --> 00:31:00,157
named George Jessel and he had
a marble mouth, like this.

808
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,326
But then there was also
an actor named Lou Jacobi

809
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:04,328
who came out
of Yiddish theater.

810
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:07,030
And he was a marble mouth, too.

811

To have this voice who
was just Dr. Zoidberg

00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:12,369
like, "Young Lady,
bring me a sandwich"

from the dumpster.

We come from radio,
stand up, improv,

819
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,994
the stage, and music.

820
00:31:36,996 --> 00:31:38,362
You have to have an ear.

821
00:31:38,364 --> 00:31:40,264
You have to hear yourself
in your head.

822
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:42,566
You have to have command
of your instrument.

823
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:45,235
It is kind of like
conducting, isn't it?

824
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:47,237
You know,
I've got my score here

825
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,840
and I've got the actors there,
and you go boom

826
00:31:49,842 --> 00:31:52,142
and the band starts playing.

827
00:31:52,144 --> 00:31:57,080
A musical ear is invaluable
to you in animated work.

828
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:58,582
The music part of it helps you

829
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:00,884
'cause every character
has a rhythm.

830
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:05,756
Like if you're thinking of
Yogi Bar it was like music.

831
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:07,090
There's a certain musicality

832
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,725
if I kind of go
all over the place.

833
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:11,828
It's interesting, although
I'm speaking right now

834
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,463
and I'm going up
on my questions

835
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:15,465
it's kind of the nature
of this guy.

836
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:17,868
Like, I don't know,
should I really do it,

837
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:21,071
but if I stay
on one particular spot

838
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:24,741
of all of sudden...

839
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:26,376
singing a note, you know?

840
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:29,680
And I think that musicality
is--is sort of

841
00:32:29,682 --> 00:32:32,316
part and parcel about
what voice actors do.

842
00:32:32,318 --> 00:32:34,351
The characters that I do,
they each have their own

843
00:32:34,353 --> 00:32:36,820
kind of, they have
their own rhythm,

844
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:38,422
their own kind of beat board,

845
00:32:38,424 --> 00:32:40,524
their own kind of--
I mean, you know,

846
00:32:40,526 --> 00:32:43,226
Nelson Muntz,
that's pretty rough.

847
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:47,230
Kind of maybe
akin Nelson Muntz too--

848
00:32:47,232 --> 00:32:48,999
The thing about
huckleberries is

849
00:32:49,001 --> 00:32:51,835
once you've had fresh you'll
never go back to canned.

850
00:32:51,837 --> 00:32:53,403
It's forceful, right?

851
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:55,605
And then you get
a Ralph Wiggum and his

852
00:32:55,607 --> 00:32:57,774
is sort of lilting, right?

853
00:32:57,776 --> 00:32:59,242
And kind of lifting.

854
00:32:59,244 --> 00:33:01,712
And you could sort of,
if you were to sort of

855
00:33:01,714 --> 00:33:03,246
graph it out in the hospital,

856
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:07,451
you know how you have
a heart rate?

857
00:33:07,453 --> 00:33:10,887
Ralph's would be all
kind of wavy and light

858
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:14,458
and Nelson's would be--

859
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,526
There's a cadence
and there's an intonation

860
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:18,395
and a rhythm to characters.

861
00:33:18,397 --> 00:33:20,263
And I think that's
the music in them.

862
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:23,767
The bad guy walks in--
into the saloon or whatever,

863
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:27,104
you'll notice that the theme
from the movie shifts

864
00:33:27,106 --> 00:33:30,874
into a minor key.

865
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:35,012
And bad guys have minor keys.

866
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:37,981
A lot of us are musicians.

867
00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:40,384
Some of us are singers.

868
00:33:40,386 --> 00:33:45,722
Some of us can play
beautiful piano like this.

869
00:33:45,724 --> 00:33:49,192
I, unfortunately
am not one of those guys.

870
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,728
I heard directors trying
to tell actors, you know,

871
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,398
how to do a line
and they'll say, you know,

872
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,733
"No, Mike,
you don't understand."

873
00:33:56,735 --> 00:34:00,437
Okay, now musically that's
ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, okay?

874
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:02,539
And the guy will go, "No, Mike,
you don't understand."

875
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:05,509
And it's like, no, no Mike,
you don't understand.

876
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:07,577
And if you're musical
you give 'em

877
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:09,446
what they want
that much quicker.

878
00:34:09,448 --> 00:34:11,848
It also just enables you
when you're taking apart,

879
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,550
like an impression, you know,

880
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:16,319
you can do it musically,
you know, like you, you think,

881
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:19,456
like, guys, you know
if you're doing Walken

882
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:22,192
the first thing you gotta
do is think of like,

883
00:34:22,194 --> 00:34:25,462
where he sits in the scale
and that's like:

884
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:26,430
♪ aaahhhh

885
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,265
That's the note,
so you got that.

886
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:30,400
Then you start putting music in

887
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,436
and it's like,
on the ends of the words

888
00:34:32,438 --> 00:34:35,505
you go down, see, like this,
and you get fun,

889
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:38,075
you go up and it's like
notes on a staff,

890
00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:39,409
you know what I'm saying?

891
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:42,879
And I see
that he's taking his time,

892
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:45,615
he's pausing, yes,
and ending up

893
00:34:45,617 --> 00:34:47,818
on minor notes sometimes.

894
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,319

I like my James Gandolfini.

900
00:35:00,032 --> 00:35:01,932
He's one of my favorites
because "The Sopranos"

901
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:03,667
was a good show.

915
00:35:29,428 --> 00:35:31,261
you're still doing a character.

916
00:35:31,263 --> 00:35:32,562
You're still doing, you know,

917
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:34,164
your version of that character.

918
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:35,599
I was reading
that "Family Guy" script,

919
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:37,000
I'm gonna go on
that audition I was like,

920
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:38,502
"Man, this is such
a good script,"

921
00:35:38,504 --> 00:35:39,936
how am I gonna get this part?

922
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:41,539
What if it sounded like
Buffalo Bill from

923
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,140
"Silence of the Lambs"
and they're like

924
00:35:43,142 --> 00:35:45,542
'What does that even mean?'"

925
00:35:45,544 --> 00:35:48,478
So I did all the lines
like that.

926
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,781
Can I interest you
in a 16 piece?

927
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:54,017
Maybe with some extra honey?

928
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:55,352
Would you like a Pepsi?

929
00:35:55,354 --> 00:35:56,653
And it started there.

930
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:59,489
So I did all
the lines like that

931
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:02,192
and it just sounded
so [bleep] weird.

932
00:36:02,194 --> 00:36:03,827
And I think they liked it.

933
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:06,630
Initially this was basically
a Phil Hartman impression

934
00:36:06,632 --> 00:36:10,400
so uh, so, yeah,
it's a great skill to have

935
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:14,037
because you can then
take that voice and--

936
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,739
and twist it or put
a different accent on it

937
00:36:15,741 --> 00:36:19,309
or--or do the bad impression
of it and it might even

938
00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:21,011
be funnier, you know.

939
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:22,879
I think Hank Azaria said
that, you know,

940
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:24,514
he's just doing
bad impressions.

941
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,716
They're wonderful voices,
he's amazing, you know,

942
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:29,686
and they fit the characters
so perfectly but he, you know,

943
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:33,089
they're basically kind of
a little off impressions.

944
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:34,624
Lou--Lou the cop, for example,

945
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:38,495
is a pretty bad Stallone,
pretty lazy Stallone.

946
00:36:38,497 --> 00:36:40,597
Chief Wiggum is sort of
almost Edward G. Ro--

947
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:43,733
it's kind of
Edward G. Robinson-ish.

948
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:45,902
Or anyway,
or the Mel Blanc imitation

949
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:48,305
of Edward G. Robinson.

950
00:36:48,307 --> 00:36:52,509
Moe is a bad version
of Al Pacino.

951
00:36:52,511 --> 00:36:58,515
Uh, so yeah, but you know,
they--they're imitations to me

952
00:36:58,517 --> 00:37:01,318
but they come out
as character voices.

953
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,753
I was just thinking
what a good parking job

954
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:04,955
I did with it.

955
00:37:04,957 --> 00:37:05,855
Yeah, hey, that is nice.

956
00:37:05,857 --> 00:37:07,157
Hey Lou.

957
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:09,793
Lou, check out
that park job in 7A.

958
00:37:09,795 --> 00:37:12,562
Woo-hoo, that's sweet.

959
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:15,098
There's always
that fun game of going

960
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,866
"Who is that? Who is that?"

961
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:18,068
or listening to commercials

962
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,170
and hearing a voice and going

963
00:37:20,172 --> 00:37:21,438
"I know who that is."

964
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,839
"You're on SpongeBob?"

965
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:23,940
I love that, I love the fact

966
00:37:23,942 --> 00:37:25,208
that they don't know it.

967
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,309
I'm Mr. Krabs,
what do you mean,

968
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:27,711
you don't know?

969
00:37:27,713 --> 00:37:30,347
I love, like, the look
in the little kids' eyes

970
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:31,982
when they find out
and they say, you know,

971
00:37:31,984 --> 00:37:33,183
"Can you do the voice?"

972
00:37:33,185 --> 00:37:34,718
Which happens nearly every day.

973
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,120
And sort of the way
their eyes pop.

974
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:39,889
Bobby kinda sounds
like this, Larry.

975
00:37:39,891 --> 00:37:41,424
Are you a Jewish fellow?

976
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,126
That's so interesting.

977
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:45,662
I do love the fact
that Nancy Cartwright

978
00:37:45,664 --> 00:37:49,199
is a woman and she plays
Bart Simpson.

979
00:37:49,201 --> 00:37:51,101
And it freaks kids out.
Kids'll say to me,

980
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:52,769
"Do Bart, do Bart!"

981
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:56,373
And if it's a little guy
I'll say, "Close your eyes"

982
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:58,275
because, come on, I'm a chick.

983
00:37:58,277 --> 00:37:59,776
I don't have nine spikes
on the top of my head,

984
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,177
I'm certainly not 10 years old,

985
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:02,512
but, you know,
for a little kid,

986
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:04,047
close your eyes,
"Hi, I'm Bart Simpson.

987
00:38:04,049 --> 00:38:05,548
What's happening, man?"

988
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,851
All you hear,
all you need, really,

989
00:38:07,853 --> 00:38:11,187
is the sound, right?

990
00:38:11,189 --> 00:38:12,722
I think it's great.

991
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:14,291
On camera I'm pretty
much limited to,

992
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:15,525
you know, what you see here.

993
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:17,494
I mean, you could put me
in old age makeup

994
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:19,696
and I could play
an older version of myself,

995
00:38:19,698 --> 00:38:23,400
but uh, you can't put me
in young makeup and make me,

996
00:38:23,402 --> 00:38:24,634
you know, 10 years old again,

997
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,803
but I can play 10,
you know, in a cartoon.

998
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:27,637
I can easily do that.

999
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:28,605
I can play, you know,

1000
00:38:28,607 --> 00:38:30,240
an older version of myself.

1001
00:38:30,242 --> 00:38:31,941
You know, I could play--
I could play

1002
00:38:31,943 --> 00:38:33,143
a female if I wanted to.

1003
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:34,611
Doing a show
like "American Dad"

1004
00:38:34,613 --> 00:38:37,514
we have such enormous casts
every single week

1005
00:38:37,516 --> 00:38:40,283
and because we can't, you know,

1006
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:43,219
be using 20 or 30 actors
we have to do a lot of--

1007
00:38:43,221 --> 00:38:45,455
we have to fill in and do
a lot of different characters.

1008
00:38:45,457 --> 00:38:47,223
So I've gotten over
the last eight years

1009
00:38:47,225 --> 00:38:49,259
to really be able
to stretch my range

1010
00:38:49,261 --> 00:38:50,794
and really get
an opportunity to do things

1011
00:38:50,796 --> 00:38:52,629
that I wouldn't
normally have gotten to do.

1012
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:55,832
Animation I think, now for me
takes the place of stage.

1013
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:58,401
Because stage I could do
lots of different characters

1014
00:38:58,403 --> 00:39:01,338
that I would never
get cast on on film,

1015
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,672
but it's like, stretching.

1016
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,341
You know,
you can stretch on stage

1017
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:06,810
and do, you know,
very bizarre old men

1018
00:39:06,812 --> 00:39:09,779
or young-- young women or boys

1019
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:11,414
or whatever you wanna
do on stage,

1020
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:13,083
you do the same thing
in animation.

1021
00:39:13,085 --> 00:39:15,418
Everyone's kinda got
a little--a little bag

1022
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,488
of tricks, a little cart
that they bring

1023
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:19,823
around with them, actually.

1024
00:39:19,825 --> 00:39:21,358
At least, that's how
I look at it.

1025
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,260
You know, occasionally
someone needs a--

1026
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:26,996
[pig squealing ]

1027
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:29,232
Like a pig, but--
but that could be...

1028
00:39:29,234 --> 00:39:31,101
[deep pig noise]

1029
00:39:31,103 --> 00:39:33,269
You can open up
the chambers in your throat

1030
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:35,004
to make it larger.

1031
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:38,808
[grunting animal noise]

1032
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:42,278
And you can--you can modify
the column of air.

1033
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:46,950
[animal screaming noise]

1034
00:39:46,952 --> 00:39:49,719
You can just squinch it up
there in all these

1035
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:52,789
just horrific kinds of ways.

1036
00:39:54,959 --> 00:40:00,063
[large growling animal]

1037
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:06,603
[animal noise echoed]

1038
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:22,786
[baby crying]

1039
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,924
What, you want
a Jewish baby? Right?

1040
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:31,861
What do you want,
an Italian baby?

1041
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:34,063
Say, that works swell.

1042
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:35,999
The dolphin.

1043
00:40:36,001 --> 00:40:37,634
The dolphin-esque laugh.

1044
00:40:37,636 --> 00:40:39,936
I always loved Droopy.

1045
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:42,639
He's always a very
fascinating character for me.

1046
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:44,808
Isn't that rather
fetching, cap'n?

1047
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:47,210
And yes, I have to do that.

1048
00:40:47,212 --> 00:40:49,879
It hurts after two hours,
but that's all.

1049
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:52,682
Well, I can do him
sort of like that,

1050
00:40:52,684 --> 00:40:54,751
but it's a little,
it's a little easier

1051
00:40:54,753 --> 00:40:56,753
if I take my jowls and go--

1052
00:40:56,755 --> 00:40:59,589
And then Jamie Thomason,
the director at the time,

1053
00:40:59,591 --> 00:41:01,424
he said, "Try one."

1054
00:41:01,426 --> 00:41:04,561
And I, you know,
I remember laughing, going,

1055
00:41:04,563 --> 00:41:06,796
Well, it does sound a little
better with just one

1056
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,631
and it's not too much that way.

1057
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:11,501
Not too bubbly and yet
just bubbly enough.

1058
00:41:11,503 --> 00:41:13,036
Aye-aye cap'n.

1059
00:41:13,038 --> 00:41:16,072
Set 'er down, boys.

1060
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:17,674
Daws also talked
about physical.

1061
00:41:17,676 --> 00:41:20,610
When he did Yogi Bear,
he would stick his chest out.

1062
00:41:20,612 --> 00:41:22,545
That's how he did it.

1063
00:41:22,547 --> 00:41:24,714
What I teach my students is
if you physically play

1064
00:41:24,716 --> 00:41:26,549
the character
the voice will follow.

1065
00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:29,686
When I do Joseph
my fingers always go out.

1066
00:41:29,688 --> 00:41:32,922
And the sound guys
you can hear this because

1067
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:34,424
there's this noise
in my fingers,

1068
00:41:34,426 --> 00:41:36,759
and I never do this
in my daily life.

1069
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:38,228
A lot of it comes out
of, you know,

1070
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:41,698
"Bobby, I'm not..."
and it just happens.

1071
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:46,069
And we do Ackbar on
"Robot Chicken" it is this.

1072
00:41:46,071 --> 00:41:47,670
It's because, you know,
Ackbar's always,

1073
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:49,138
"It's a trap"
and he's doing this.

1074
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,774
I remember with Rocko
to get into character

1075
00:41:51,776 --> 00:41:55,245
it might be, "Oh my"
I'd sort of literally

1076
00:41:55,247 --> 00:41:56,813
put my hands together
because that's how

1077
00:41:56,815 --> 00:41:58,681
they animated it, "Oh, my."

1078
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:01,184
You don't necessarily
have to cross your eyes,

1079
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:04,454
because nobody will see that,
but for me, it helps

1080
00:42:04,456 --> 00:42:08,057
to get into that real dumb
kinda guy.

1081
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:10,693
You're not separated
from your voice.

1082
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:13,863
Your body's do--your body
does the work as it will.

1083
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,798
You see them all doing,
you know,

1084
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,201
you're in the character,
your body can't help

1085
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:21,971
becoming the character
and you can't sit there and go,

1086
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:23,339
my voice is doing this.

1087
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:25,341
You know, it's like
I see Doofenshmirtz up there,

1088
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:28,344
I record the voice,
he comes out there

1089
00:42:28,346 --> 00:42:30,914
and as soon as the voice
is attached to those drawings

1090
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:33,249
that's just his voice to me.

1091
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:36,686
And the first time I saw
a video of me doing it I--

1092
00:42:36,688 --> 00:42:39,889
my first thought, literally,
was, "That's not what"

1093
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:41,724
I pictured that guy
looking like."

1094
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:47,564
[speaking gibberish]

1095
00:42:47,566 --> 00:42:49,532
Volition is our ability
to choose what

1096
00:42:49,534 --> 00:42:51,067
we are going to do.

1097
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:53,670
Whereas evolution,
that's got something to do

1098
00:42:53,672 --> 00:42:55,805
with monkeys, I think.

1099
00:42:55,807 --> 00:43:01,077
To be or n-n-n-n--
the opposite.

1100
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,079
Tha-the-that is
the question, folks.

1101
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:05,081
They got a dime a dozen
people who can say

1102
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,317
"What's up, doc",
"I tawt I taw a puddy tat,"

1103
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:08,618
"That's all folks."

1104
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:11,821
If you can do Shakespeare
as Porky Pig

1105
00:43:11,823 --> 00:43:14,924
or Sylvester the cat
and stay in character,

1106
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:18,127
you probably can handle
the script for the movie.

1107
00:43:18,129 --> 00:43:22,165
I'm not trained in this
so forgive me.

1108
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:23,800
All the world's a stage.

1109
00:43:23,802 --> 00:43:27,604
And all the men and women,
merely players.

1110
00:43:27,606 --> 00:43:30,139
They have their exits
and entrances.

1111
00:43:30,141 --> 00:43:34,043
And one man in his time
plays many parts.

1112
00:43:34,045 --> 00:43:35,712
His acts being seven ages.

1113
00:43:35,714 --> 00:43:38,681
At first the infant.

1114
00:43:38,683 --> 00:43:42,251
Mewling and puking
in the nurse's arms.

1115
00:43:42,253 --> 00:43:45,188
[baby crying]

1116
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:47,323
Doesn't sound good
to me, folks.

1117
00:43:47,325 --> 00:43:51,194
And then a whining
schoolboy with this satchel

1118
00:43:51,196 --> 00:43:52,729
and shining morning face.

1119
00:43:52,731 --> 00:43:56,432
Creeping like snail
unwillingly to school.

1120
00:43:56,434 --> 00:43:58,101
And then the lover.

1121
00:43:58,103 --> 00:43:59,502
Sighing like furnace.

1122
00:43:59,504 --> 00:44:02,639
With a woeful ballad made
to his mistress' eyebrows.

1123
00:44:02,641 --> 00:44:04,841
I don't know why he's
talking to the eyebrows.

1124
00:44:04,843 --> 00:44:06,476
It's a strange place
to talk to.

1125
00:44:06,478 --> 00:44:07,577
But there you go.

1126
00:44:07,579 --> 00:44:09,779
And a soldier.

1127
00:44:09,781 --> 00:44:13,850
Full of strange oaths
and bearded like the pard.

1128
00:44:13,852 --> 00:44:15,418
Oh, a bearded pard.

1129
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:20,023
Jealous in honor,
sudden and quick in quarrel,

1130
00:44:20,025 --> 00:44:23,960
seeking the bubble reputation
in the cannon's mouth.

1131
00:44:23,962 --> 00:44:27,664
And then the justice
in fair round belly

1132
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:29,799
with good capon lined.

1133
00:44:29,801 --> 00:44:33,803
With eyes severe
and beard formal cut.

1134
00:44:33,805 --> 00:44:38,641
Full of wise saws
and modern instances, yes.

1135
00:44:38,643 --> 00:44:41,010
And so he plays his part.

1136
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:45,848
Sixth age shifts into the lean
and slippered pantaloon.

1137
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:48,885
How would you like to slip
into a slippered pantaloon?

1138
00:44:48,887 --> 00:44:50,119
That's very naughty.

1139
00:44:50,121 --> 00:44:54,157
With spectacles on nose
and pouch on side.

1140
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:56,659
His youthful hose.

1141
00:44:56,661 --> 00:44:58,594
Well saved, a world too wide

1142
00:44:58,596 --> 00:45:00,096
for his shrunk shank.

1143
00:45:00,098 --> 00:45:02,832
Oh, that's a small shank
he's got there.

1144
00:45:02,834 --> 00:45:05,635
And his big manly voice.

1145
00:45:05,637 --> 00:45:08,371
Turning again to
a childish treble pipes

1146
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:10,506
and whistles in his sound.

1147
00:45:10,508 --> 00:45:12,442
Last scene of all.

1148
00:45:12,444 --> 00:45:13,676
What, what, what?

1149
00:45:13,678 --> 00:45:16,045
There ends this strange,
eventful history.

1150
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:18,648
Is second childishness
and mere oblivion.

1151
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:21,517
- Sans teeth.
- Sans eyes.

1152
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:24,420
- Sans taste.
- Sans everything.

1153
00:45:24,422 --> 00:45:27,623
Scene. Where's my check?

1154
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:30,159
The thing I love
is when people find out

1155
00:45:30,161 --> 00:45:33,463
that this, you know, SpongeBob,

1156
00:45:33,465 --> 00:45:35,198
and the lottery scratcher guy,

1157
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,666
and the guy from the kids' show

1158
00:45:36,668 --> 00:45:38,468
that their three
year old watches,

1159
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:41,838
and the guy saying "side
effects may include diarrhea"

1160
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,906
are all the same guy.

1161
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:46,876
I freaking--that, to me,
that's the payback.

1162
00:45:46,878 --> 00:45:48,511
They go, "That's all you?"

1163
00:45:48,513 --> 00:45:50,213
That's all the same guy?"
you go, "Yeah."

1164
00:45:50,215 --> 00:45:51,781
They go, "You're like
Where's Waldo, man",

1165
00:45:51,783 --> 00:45:53,182
that's like, incredible.

1166
00:45:53,184 --> 00:45:55,985
"You're everywhere,
yet nowhere, man."

1167
00:45:55,987 --> 00:45:57,520
It's really important
in animation

1168
00:45:57,522 --> 00:45:59,055
to not just have one voice.

1169
00:45:59,057 --> 00:46:00,957
There are certainly people
that can maintain careers

1170
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:02,692
with a kitsch voice or sound,

1171
00:46:02,694 --> 00:46:04,327
but for the people
that work a lot,

1172
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:05,962
it's because they're versatile,

1173
00:46:05,964 --> 00:46:07,630
it's because they can
change their voice.

1174
00:46:07,632 --> 00:46:09,999
For the most part people
wouldn't guess that Bubbles

1175
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:12,335
is the same as Terrence
from "Foster's Home"

1176
00:46:12,337 --> 00:46:14,036
because one is like
a very high pitched

1177
00:46:14,038 --> 00:46:15,972
girl like this
and the other is a dude.

1178
00:46:15,974 --> 00:46:18,040
I'm not a chubby cry baby.

1179
00:46:18,042 --> 00:46:19,942
Ooh, that's even better.

1180
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:22,745
All the way in Malaysia.

1181
00:46:22,747 --> 00:46:24,881
They're gonna pick people
that, "Hey, can you throw in"

1182
00:46:24,883 --> 00:46:25,982
a cheerleader or a little boy

1183
00:46:25,984 --> 00:46:27,917
"or a little girl
or an old lady"

1184
00:46:27,919 --> 00:46:29,685
and you're just going
to work more

1185
00:46:29,687 --> 00:46:31,587
if you can bring another
character to life.

1186
00:46:31,589 --> 00:46:34,023
Versatility is the name
of the game.

1187
00:46:34,025 --> 00:46:36,225
The more changes
that you can make,

1188
00:46:36,227 --> 00:46:38,060
the more nuances,
the more characters

1189
00:46:38,062 --> 00:46:40,563
that you can come up with,
the better chances are

1190
00:46:40,565 --> 00:46:41,831
that you're getting cast.

1191
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:43,699
Sign falling on Randy, action.

1192
00:46:43,701 --> 00:46:45,034
Ow!

1193
00:46:45,036 --> 00:46:48,604
Sal infuriated by
this loud space noise.

1194
00:46:48,606 --> 00:46:50,273
Ah, quiet!

1195
00:46:50,275 --> 00:46:53,509
I can't hear myself
jack hammering.

1196
00:46:53,511 --> 00:46:54,777
Ryan's dad.

1197
00:46:54,779 --> 00:46:57,413
You mean before the Y2K
turns our computers

1198
00:46:57,415 --> 00:46:59,248
and waffle irons against us?

1199
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:03,052
I've played black guys,
I've played transvestite

1200
00:47:03,054 --> 00:47:06,322
prostitute robots,
I've played women aliens,

1201
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:11,994
I've played so many
different kinds

1202
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:14,931
of characters through
voice acting.

1203
00:47:14,933 --> 00:47:16,866
And it's f-- it's so freeing

1204
00:47:16,868 --> 00:47:20,136
and it's so much fun
and I get to be broad

1205
00:47:20,138 --> 00:47:22,438
and I get to perform,
I get to act,

1206
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,307
I get to live this out.

1207
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:30,379
On camera... playing--
playing a black guy?

1208
00:47:30,381 --> 00:47:31,581
There's no way.

1209
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,748
There's no way.

1210
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,317
I have a project called
"Off the Curb"

1211
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,719
it's with Mondo Media,
it's a web show that

1212
00:47:36,721 --> 00:47:40,723
the whole cartoon itself
is improv and it's four--

1213
00:47:40,725 --> 00:47:43,259
four guys on a street corner
of African-American descent

1214
00:47:43,261 --> 00:47:46,095
talking about whatever subject
they're talking about.

1215
00:47:46,097 --> 00:47:48,197
Frankenstein would whoop
Dracula's ass.

1216
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:50,266
- Ah, hell no.
- No, it's the truth.

1217
00:47:50,268 --> 00:47:52,101
- That's ridiculous.
- That is not ridiculous.

1218
00:47:52,103 --> 00:47:53,569
Here's why it's ridiculous.

1219
00:47:53,571 --> 00:47:55,304
How is the only thing
Frankenstein got from it,

1220
00:47:55,306 --> 00:47:57,273
he got some metal bolts
in the neck

1221
00:47:57,275 --> 00:47:59,141
where Dracula would
normally bite him,

1222
00:47:59,143 --> 00:48:01,310
but Dracula would suck
Frankenstein dry.

1223
00:48:01,312 --> 00:48:02,979
Willie, that's bullshit, man.

1224
00:48:02,981 --> 00:48:04,847
Frankenstein would
come up on Dracula

1225
00:48:04,849 --> 00:48:06,182
and punch him
right in the mouth.

1226
00:48:06,184 --> 00:48:07,450
Gentlemen, I just need
to correct you,

1227
00:48:07,452 --> 00:48:08,818
it's not Frankenstein.

1228
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:10,219
That's Frankenstein's monster.

1229
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:12,255
The monster's name is Tomas.

1230
00:48:12,257 --> 00:48:14,490
You can't suck the blood out
of a man who already dead.

1231
00:48:14,492 --> 00:48:15,858
That's right, it's green blood.

1232
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,126
Green blood?

1233
00:48:17,128 --> 00:48:19,128
So that how it started
and I thought,

1234
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:21,063
about a year later,
I should get an all star cast.

1235
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:22,231
Why not get black people?

1236
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:24,467
Why not get real black people?

1237
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:31,407
Basically that stuff
is um, animated jazz.

1238
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:34,076
Nobody's louder
than John DiMaggio.

1239
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:35,778
The policemen are having
the sirens ripped out

1240
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:37,246
of the car
and just replaced with

1241
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:40,383
John DiMaggio saying
"Slow down!"

1242
00:48:40,385 --> 00:48:42,118
He plays--he plays
a black character

1243
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,353
in this thing than
we're doing and like,

1244
00:48:44,355 --> 00:48:46,255
there are people I love
to be mad with like,

1245
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:48,891
"Man, don't do no black
character, you're insulting"

1246
00:48:48,893 --> 00:48:51,027
But him it's like,
"Respect, respect."

1247
00:48:51,029 --> 00:48:52,361
So I've gone out
and gotten him several

1248
00:48:52,363 --> 00:48:54,664
black girlfriends
just off the power

1249
00:48:54,666 --> 00:48:56,299
of his throat alone.

1250
00:48:56,301 --> 00:48:58,668
He has what they call
an anteo-negro throat

1251
00:48:58,670 --> 00:48:59,902
in the business.

1252
00:48:59,904 --> 00:49:03,172
Very negro throated.

1253
00:49:03,174 --> 00:49:06,575
He's the blackest
white guy I know.

1254
00:49:06,577 --> 00:49:09,378
Hey, listen, I'm--
for one thing I'm gonna

1255
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:14,016
tell you right now,
white people,

1256
00:49:14,018 --> 00:49:16,686
with they dogs and they yoga,

1257
00:49:16,688 --> 00:49:19,288
man, frustrating.

1258
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,190
That's all I gotta say,
frustrating.

1259
00:49:21,192 --> 00:49:23,292
White people are frustrating.

1260
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:25,995
Coming out to Hollywood
you're like, "You know what?"

1261
00:49:25,997 --> 00:49:28,731
No, you're not gonna do
anything and everything.

1262
00:49:28,733 --> 00:49:31,500
"Not all of it is-- is for you."

1263
00:49:31,502 --> 00:49:34,136
But with animation
you can become anything

1264
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:35,471
and everything you want.

1265
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:38,240
Now I love animation.

1266
00:49:38,242 --> 00:49:41,911
I love animation because
in the world of animation

1267
00:49:41,913 --> 00:49:44,413
you could be anything
you wanna be.

1268
00:49:44,415 --> 00:49:46,582
If you're a fat woman,
you could play

1269
00:49:46,584 --> 00:49:48,417
a skinny princess.

1270
00:49:48,419 --> 00:49:50,286
If you're a short wimpy guy,

1271
00:49:50,288 --> 00:49:52,922
you could play
a tall gladiator.

1272
00:49:52,924 --> 00:49:55,725
If you're a white man,
you could play

1273
00:49:55,727 --> 00:49:57,693
an Arabian prince.

1274
00:49:57,695 --> 00:50:01,030
If you're a black man
you could play a donkey

1275
00:50:01,032 --> 00:50:03,132
or a zebra.

1276
00:50:03,134 --> 00:50:05,234
And if you're a Filipino
Canadian,

1277
00:50:05,236 --> 00:50:08,170
you could play Chris Rock.

1278
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:11,707
I don't know which
staunchy guys

1279
00:50:11,709 --> 00:50:13,576
you've had in here
that said it's difficult

1280
00:50:13,578 --> 00:50:15,911
I'd like to punch them all
in the throat

1281
00:50:15,913 --> 00:50:16,879
for saying such a thing.

1282
00:50:16,881 --> 00:50:18,147
It's not.

1283
00:50:18,149 --> 00:50:20,649
Anyone can do this immediately.

1284
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:23,719
Get in your car
and drive to Los Angeles.

1285
00:50:23,721 --> 00:50:26,589
Get here right now
and get on the microphone,

1286
00:50:26,591 --> 00:50:28,290
you'll make millions of dollars

1287
00:50:28,292 --> 00:50:30,526
and have both white
and Asian women.

1288
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:33,829
You know, we spend
98% of our time

1289
00:50:33,831 --> 00:50:35,297
doing the business
of doing business

1290
00:50:35,299 --> 00:50:36,932
like tracking down
the opportunities,

1291
00:50:36,934 --> 00:50:39,168
doing the auditions,
sending in the mp3s,

1292
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:40,469
blah, blah, blah.

1293
00:50:40,471 --> 00:50:42,538
But the 2% of the time
we get to actually play

1294
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:45,441
and have fun,
that's why I do it.

1295
00:50:45,443 --> 00:50:47,243
The hardships with
the voiceover business

1296
00:50:47,245 --> 00:50:50,946
if you're talent, number one,
is getting an agent.

1297
00:50:50,948 --> 00:50:53,282
A good agent is somebody
who's gonna get out

1298
00:50:53,284 --> 00:50:57,319
and try to get your name
and your voice track around

1299
00:50:57,321 --> 00:50:59,422
so people pay attention to you.

1300
00:50:59,424 --> 00:51:02,658
Hey, Don Pitts, just callin'
in to see how Casey's doing.

1301
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,527
He was my first agent.

1302
00:51:04,529 --> 00:51:07,530
He'd be, "Okay, here's a spot
for Target, Jeff,"

1303
00:51:07,532 --> 00:51:09,632
and he'd have a little thing
and he'd have a timer

1304
00:51:09,634 --> 00:51:12,635
and he'd say, "And you got
60 seconds and go!"

1305
00:51:12,637 --> 00:51:14,937
You know, so all my--
all my readings were like,

1306
00:51:14,939 --> 00:51:17,039
"At Target" you have, you know?

1307
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:19,275
When we cast a series
our casting director

1308
00:51:19,277 --> 00:51:22,645
goes to the agents and asks
them to submit their clients.

1309
00:51:22,647 --> 00:51:24,713
And that's how--
that's actually,

1310
00:51:24,715 --> 00:51:27,083
that is how it works.

1311
00:51:27,085 --> 00:51:30,152
Primarily my job
is to find the talent

1312
00:51:30,154 --> 00:51:33,055
and to narrow it down
to the top choices of people

1313
00:51:33,057 --> 00:51:34,857
that I feel would be best
for a part,

1314
00:51:34,859 --> 00:51:36,292
pass them onto my show runner,

1315
00:51:36,294 --> 00:51:39,095
my creator, my director,
whoever is making

1316
00:51:39,097 --> 00:51:40,996
those final choices,
and then work with them

1317
00:51:40,998 --> 00:51:42,731
to get the best people
in the booths.

1318
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:44,867
We do tons and tons
and tons of auditions.

1319
00:51:44,869 --> 00:51:46,669
I remember back when we
were at Disney we had to do

1320
00:51:46,671 --> 00:51:49,105
a PowerPoint presentation
and we calculated that,

1321
00:51:49,107 --> 00:51:53,042
you know, we did somewhere in
the neighborhood of, you know,

1322
00:51:53,044 --> 00:51:56,512
5 to 15,000 auditions a year.

1323
00:51:56,514 --> 00:52:00,816
And I'd been there at
the time for over a decade.

1324
00:52:00,818 --> 00:52:03,018
I'm not a math major.

1325
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,521
But uh, that's a lot
of auditions.

1326
00:52:05,523 --> 00:52:07,923
Auditions are
our chance to shine

1327
00:52:07,925 --> 00:52:10,259
and to really show the writers
and directors and producers

1328
00:52:10,261 --> 00:52:11,694
we're the right person
for the job.

1329
00:52:11,696 --> 00:52:13,529
The directors bring
voice actors in

1330
00:52:13,531 --> 00:52:15,064
because they know
they'll perform

1331
00:52:15,066 --> 00:52:16,832
and they'll do it
right on the spot.

1332
00:52:16,834 --> 00:52:20,936
You gotta be able to do it
or you'll get the heave-ho.

1333
00:52:20,938 --> 00:52:22,705
The union standard
is a four hour session,

1334
00:52:22,707 --> 00:52:25,441
it's either nine to one
or two to six and uh,

1335
00:52:25,443 --> 00:52:27,576
they've also gotta record
an 11 minute episode

1336
00:52:27,578 --> 00:52:30,880
or a 22 minute episode
plus a whole bunch of ADR

1337
00:52:30,882 --> 00:52:34,016
from an episode that you did
a couple weeks ago,

1338
00:52:34,018 --> 00:52:35,851
and then the animation came
back on this other episode

1339
00:52:35,853 --> 00:52:37,786
and some of the lip
assignments aren't right,

1340
00:52:37,788 --> 00:52:39,855
we had to change the lines
and these jokes weren't clear

1341
00:52:39,857 --> 00:52:41,257
so we rewrote some of these.

1342
00:52:41,259 --> 00:52:42,691
So, you know, and that's all

1343
00:52:42,693 --> 00:52:44,927
in a four hour session.

1344

1347
00:52:51,169 --> 00:52:52,434
you feel like
you're involved there,

1348

maybe you'll be able

1352
00:53:02,146 --> 00:53:03,846
to go back there,
but it's kind of

1353
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:05,648
a very tenuous thing.

1354
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:11,420
You know, it's this
vagabond kind of lifestyle

1355
00:53:11,422 --> 00:53:14,790
and you go in and, you know,
you hang your shingle

1356
00:53:14,792 --> 00:53:17,860
in different little places
and then it's time

1357

So that's what
we're shooting today,

1365
00:53:37,782 --> 00:53:39,615

but it will be

1366
00:53:39,617 --> 00:53:42,251
a very funny day,
so that's that.

1367
00:53:42,253 --> 00:53:44,920

1406
00:55:32,797 --> 00:55:35,264
that was the first anime
that was their gateway

1407
00:55:35,266 --> 00:55:36,765
into that whole genre.

1408
00:55:36,767 --> 00:55:41,003
With foreign dubbing
or anime shows like "Pokemon,"

1409
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:44,573
"Naruto," it's already been
completely created,

1410
00:55:44,575 --> 00:55:48,477
animated, released
somewhere oversees.

1411
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:51,347
You go into a studio
by yourself

1412
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:54,049
and you sync it up
to the picture.

1413
00:55:54,051 --> 00:55:57,419
So they will take
each sentence line by line

1414
00:55:57,421 --> 00:56:00,622
and you will sync it
to fit the lip flaps

1415
00:56:00,624 --> 00:56:02,725
of the preexisting picture.

1416
00:56:02,727 --> 00:56:05,294
You literally watch TV
and talk at the TV all day

1417
00:56:05,296 --> 00:56:08,030
and hopefully you've got
good writers and on that

1418
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:12,601
fourth imaginary beep you
try and bring this character

1419
00:56:12,603 --> 00:56:14,970
to life, you try to lift it
off the page,

1420
00:56:14,972 --> 00:56:18,440
with the constraints of--
of time because it's already

1421
00:56:18,442 --> 00:56:20,609
been animated,
the flaps are already there

1422
00:56:20,611 --> 00:56:22,845
and you wanna try and make it
sound as natural

1423
00:56:22,847 --> 00:56:24,780
as possible so it's not
one of these

1424
00:56:24,782 --> 00:56:26,615
"You have destroyed my village"
kind of a thing.

1425
00:56:26,617 --> 00:56:28,951
I never really knew
this world existed until,

1426
00:56:28,953 --> 00:56:31,653
I mean, I grew up watching
"Speed Racer" and everything,

1427
00:56:31,655 --> 00:56:33,522
but I never, I don't know,
it's weird,

1428
00:56:33,524 --> 00:56:35,357
you never sort of
make that connection with,

1429
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:37,626
"Oh, I can do this
for a living?

1430
00:56:37,628 --> 00:56:38,961
That's pretty awesome."

1431
00:56:38,963 --> 00:56:41,497
People knew I was
a fan geek way before

1432
00:56:41,499 --> 00:56:42,931
George Lucas' movies.

1433
00:56:42,933 --> 00:56:44,867
But, to me, you use
your imagination

1434
00:56:44,869 --> 00:56:46,668
whether you're playing
Robin Hood

1435
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:50,139
or you're playing Zorro,
Superman, whatever it is,

1436
00:56:50,141 --> 00:56:51,940
it's not that different.

1437
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:53,242
It really isn't.

1438
00:56:53,244 --> 00:56:55,844
With voiceover,
I'm just telling you, I said,

1439
00:56:55,846 --> 00:56:57,780
"Where has this been
all my life?"

1440
00:56:57,782 --> 00:57:02,551
Because it's the ultimate
kind of fun job to do.

1441
00:57:02,553 --> 00:57:04,553
This iteration of
"Star Wars: Clone Wars"

1442
00:57:04,555 --> 00:57:07,222
came out, not only was
the artwork tremendous,

1443
00:57:07,224 --> 00:57:09,591
not only was the writing
outstanding,

1444
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:11,593
not only was
the voicework great,

1445
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:15,230
but it was also in a world
that had evolved

1446
00:57:15,232 --> 00:57:21,503
from, you know, my little
17 year old boner life

1447
00:57:21,505 --> 00:57:26,875
to--to this really
super sophisticated comment

1448
00:57:26,877 --> 00:57:29,578
about what's been going on
and what could go on

1449
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:31,046
and how it should go on.

1450
00:57:31,048 --> 00:57:34,450
I mean, it's--
it was kind of outstanding,

1451
00:57:34,452 --> 00:57:37,152
and yet had this
nostalgic feel.

1452
00:57:37,154 --> 00:57:39,521
Currently I'm um,
I'm the voice of the clones

1453
00:57:39,523 --> 00:57:41,490
on "Star Wars: The Clone Wars."

1454
00:57:41,492 --> 00:57:43,859
The trick and the fun of it
is to flavor them

1455
00:57:43,861 --> 00:57:46,895
a little bit differently
each time we do them

1456
00:57:46,897 --> 00:57:48,864
to--to make one
a little bit younger,

1457
00:57:48,866 --> 00:57:50,499
to make one a little bit older,

1458
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:52,034
to--to make one, you know,
with a little bit

1459
00:57:52,036 --> 00:57:54,603
more swagger to him
so they all sound

1460
00:57:54,605 --> 00:57:55,904
a little bit different.

1461
00:57:55,906 --> 00:57:58,106
That's the fun acting part.

1462
00:57:58,108 --> 00:58:02,845
The hard part is just making it
straight ahead, honest, real.

1463
00:58:02,847 --> 00:58:05,247
He'll strike a crippling
blow to the republic.

1464
00:58:05,249 --> 00:58:06,849
Something has to be done.

1465
00:58:06,851 --> 00:58:09,151
We can't risk the possibility
that he might escape.

1466
00:58:09,153 --> 00:58:11,420
As long as Krell's alive,
he is a threat

1467
00:58:11,422 --> 00:58:15,157
to every one of us.

1468
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:17,359
I agree.

1469
00:58:17,361 --> 00:58:20,596
George Lucas and Dave Filoni
have said,

1470
00:58:20,598 --> 00:58:22,831
"Look, this character,
Alec Guinness"

1471
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:24,666
will never be
Obi Wan Kenobi again,

1472
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:26,235
Ewan McGregor will never
be Obi Wan Kenobi again.

1473
00:58:26,237 --> 00:58:27,970
You're the representation
of Obi Wan Kenobi,

1474
00:58:27,972 --> 00:58:29,104
"so make it your own."

1475
00:58:29,106 --> 00:58:30,539
So I take a little,
"These aren't the droids

1476
00:58:30,541 --> 00:58:31,840
"you're looking for," a little,

1477
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,175
"I have a bad feeling
about this"

1478
00:58:33,177 --> 00:58:35,878
and I combine them
into my own, you know,

1479
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:36,979
Obi Wan Kenobi.

1480
00:58:36,981 --> 00:58:37,980
Prepare yourself.

1481
00:58:37,982 --> 00:58:40,916
The real fight
is about to begin.

1482
00:58:40,918 --> 00:58:44,219
With the force all things
are possible, yes.

1483
00:58:44,221 --> 00:58:45,854
Find a way, we shall.

1484
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:47,589
We all grew up
"Star Wars" fans,

1485
00:58:47,591 --> 00:58:49,792
we know these characters
like the back of our hands.

1486
00:58:49,793 --> 00:58:51,293
You know, Dave is the same way.

1487
00:58:51,295 --> 00:58:52,961
Dave was a fan before he was--

1488
00:58:52,963 --> 00:58:54,463
was an employee.

1489
00:58:54,465 --> 00:58:57,599
It's my job to get
the best out of them,

1490
00:58:57,601 --> 00:59:00,202
to get their greatest
performance,

1491
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:02,738
to get their greatest part,
what makes them creative,

1492
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:05,707
into the episodes um,
and you just,

1493
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:08,210
you can't disturb them while
they're being part

1494
00:59:08,212 --> 00:59:11,113
of that creative process.

1495
00:59:11,115 --> 00:59:13,148
Just like there's--there's
an actor for every role,

1496
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:15,050
there's a director
for every project.

1497
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:17,653
You usually start out
with a table read where

1498
00:59:17,655 --> 00:59:19,488
we just hear the script
for the first time

1499
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:22,758
and I am beginning to tune in
on what the different actors

1500
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:26,361
are doing and making notes
about what we might

1501
00:59:26,363 --> 00:59:28,063
fix or adapt.

1502
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:30,098
Come in with a plan,
right or wrong,

1503
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,768
and uh, if it's wrong
you'll fix it,

1504
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:34,436
and if it's right
you're a hero.

1505
00:59:34,438 --> 00:59:36,972
Gordon Hunt was, yeah,
like the godfather

1506
00:59:36,974 --> 00:59:37,940
of all of us.

1507
00:59:37,942 --> 00:59:39,508
And this was passed on,
by the way,

1508
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:42,578
to Ginny McSwain,
to Andrea Romano,

1509
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:44,112
who followed in his footsteps.

1510
00:59:44,114 --> 00:59:47,449
This was the, the core
team of individuals

1511
00:59:47,451 --> 00:59:49,751
who sort of set a precedent.

1512
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:52,020
Gordon Hunt was
the voice director

1513
00:59:52,022 --> 00:59:55,891
at Hanna-Barbera
for many, many years.

1514
00:59:55,893 --> 00:59:58,961
And so it was just
a real actor's director,

1515
00:59:58,963 --> 01:00:01,797
and because of the nature
of the way we make cartoons,

1516
01:00:01,799 --> 01:00:03,732
which is we record
the voices first and then

1517
01:00:03,734 --> 01:00:06,301
animate to that,
you affect the entire process

1518
01:00:06,303 --> 01:00:08,870
if you don't get a good
performance from the actors.

1519
01:00:08,872 --> 01:00:11,173
Being from the theater
I was envisioning

1520
01:00:11,175 --> 01:00:14,977
the characters as I might
cast them for a play

1521
01:00:14,979 --> 01:00:17,746
rather than just
looking down at the page

1522
01:00:17,748 --> 01:00:19,848
and listening to the voices
coming in.

1523
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:23,251
So I think inadvertently that's
how we came on that style.

1524
01:00:23,253 --> 01:00:25,887
Gordon was really
an actor's director

1525
01:00:25,889 --> 01:00:29,891
and so um, he instilled in me
the fact that these people

1526
01:00:29,893 --> 01:00:31,827
on the other side of
the glass are actors.

1527
01:00:31,829 --> 01:00:33,629
They're not mimics,
they're not puppets,

1528
01:00:33,631 --> 01:00:34,763
they're actors.

1529
01:00:34,765 --> 01:00:36,331
It's almost like their voice

1530
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:38,300
is their movie star face

1531
01:00:38,302 --> 01:00:40,168
and that's what they're
really bringing to the party.

1532
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:41,937
Just being on the other
side of that glass,

1533
01:00:41,939 --> 01:00:43,805
I know what it feels like
so I'm really sensitive

1534
01:00:43,807 --> 01:00:46,942
to making people feel
comfortable and getting them

1535
01:00:46,944 --> 01:00:49,011
loose enough that we can
just play around.

1536
01:00:49,013 --> 01:00:50,912
Actors love to play,
especially voiceover actors,

1537
01:00:50,914 --> 01:00:53,015
you just wanna, like, play.

1538
01:00:53,017 --> 01:00:55,384
But I--I will credit
Andrea Romano

1539
01:00:55,386 --> 01:00:58,153
for essentially teaching me
how to voiceover direct.

1540
01:00:58,155 --> 01:01:02,691
She just has a very casual,
easy, keep it going,

1541
01:01:02,693 --> 01:01:07,462
only get as much as you need,
playful style.

1542
01:01:07,464 --> 01:01:10,499
And I--I adopted that when
I started directing people.

1543
01:01:10,501 --> 01:01:14,603
I probably use as many
different styles of directing

1544
01:01:14,605 --> 01:01:16,271
as I can and I--
I try to deal with

1545
01:01:16,273 --> 01:01:19,307
every specific series
differently because, you know,

1546
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:22,077
I'll direct a "Batman"
episode and then go to

1547
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:23,945
a "SpongeBob" episode
and they couldn't be

1548
01:01:23,947 --> 01:01:25,213
more different as far
as the energy

1549
01:01:25,215 --> 01:01:26,515
and what we're doing.

1550
01:01:26,517 --> 01:01:30,886
They also have to be honest,
and real, and genuine,

1551
01:01:30,888 --> 01:01:33,622
and so I always deal
from that point of view.

1552
01:01:33,624 --> 01:01:36,425
To be a good voice director
you, you know,

1553
01:01:36,427 --> 01:01:38,960
you do research on the story
and you have to know

1554
01:01:38,962 --> 01:01:40,095
the story you wanna tell.

1555
01:01:40,097 --> 01:01:41,863
To be able to give direction

1556
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:45,367
without line readings...

1557
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:47,803
"Say it like this, and I'm
walking through the door,"

1558
01:01:47,805 --> 01:01:49,871
I mean, because it's not
my performance anymore,

1559
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:51,573
it's the director's
performance.

1560
01:01:51,575 --> 01:01:53,175
So you're on a boat
and you're--

1561
01:01:53,177 --> 01:01:54,943
and they're doing
the character for you,

1562
01:01:54,945 --> 01:01:56,545
they're doing
the character for you,

1563
01:01:56,547 --> 01:01:58,346
they're in the story going,
"So you're in a boat

1564
01:01:58,348 --> 01:02:00,749
and you're swimming along
and you say..."

1565
01:02:00,751 --> 01:02:05,687
and I peter out at that point.

1566
01:02:05,689 --> 01:02:08,824
They sense whether the actor
will be happy

1567
01:02:08,826 --> 01:02:10,258
with a line reading
or won't be.

1568
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:12,661
I don't mind
line readings at all.

1569
01:02:12,663 --> 01:02:14,863
I will do anything
to get a performance.

1570
01:02:14,865 --> 01:02:19,034
I will do anything
and have, almost.

1571
01:02:19,036 --> 01:02:21,703
Charlie's the fastest
director ever.

1572
01:02:21,705 --> 01:02:26,942
He'll give you a line reading
because it's the best direction.

1573
01:02:26,944 --> 01:02:29,244
He is an exception to the rule.

1574
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:31,513
Can we show Charlie right now?

1575
01:02:31,515 --> 01:02:34,716
Charlie, I love you.

1576
01:02:34,718 --> 01:02:37,486
This is so spontaneous
and part of what makes

1577
01:02:37,488 --> 01:02:40,288
the work so thrilling
is not squashing the energy

1578
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:43,291
and keeping the actors
engaged and excited,

1579
01:02:43,293 --> 01:02:45,894
and spontaneous and still
being able to balance

1580
01:02:45,896 --> 01:02:47,229
what's being said in the room,

1581
01:02:47,231 --> 01:02:49,531
being able to deliver it
as quickly as possible,

1582
01:02:49,533 --> 01:02:52,768
as clearly as possible
and without having anybody

1583
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:54,936
feel like they're being
dishonored.

1584
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:59,274
With computers now anybody
can sit at home and make

1585
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:00,909
a little animated piece.

1586
01:03:00,911 --> 01:03:02,844
And you can get that out there
and people can see it

1587
01:03:02,846 --> 01:03:05,313
and so many folks
are getting, you know,

1588
01:03:05,315 --> 01:03:06,915
the invite either
to come and create

1589
01:03:06,917 --> 01:03:09,251
or to do a show
of that little bit

1590
01:03:09,253 --> 01:03:10,886
that they created
on the internet,

1591
01:03:10,888 --> 01:03:13,054
some little YouTube film,

1592
01:03:13,056 --> 01:03:15,090
and that's how
they're getting word out.

1593
01:03:15,092 --> 01:03:17,125
That's really great.

1594
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:19,861
As far as getting your work
out there to be seen

1595
01:03:19,863 --> 01:03:22,531
by industry professionals,
I think the game

1596
01:03:22,533 --> 01:03:23,865
has totally changed.

1597
01:03:23,867 --> 01:03:25,934
At one point it was
friends of friends.

1598
01:03:25,936 --> 01:03:27,869
You could only get
your foot in the door

1599
01:03:27,871 --> 01:03:29,771
if you knew someone else.

1600
01:03:29,773 --> 01:03:32,541
But now when I'm
searching for talent

1601
01:03:32,543 --> 01:03:33,909
I'll go on the internet.

1602
01:03:33,911 --> 01:03:36,444
Technically from--
as a guy who has

1603
01:03:36,446 --> 01:03:39,981
his own podcast
and a producer side of things,

1604
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:43,151
it's [bleep] great
because I take my laptop

1605
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:45,520
or my iPad
and a plug-in USB mic,

1606
01:03:45,522 --> 01:03:47,355
and I go to Johnny D's house
and we sit down.

1607
01:03:47,357 --> 01:03:50,225
Boom, here's the mic,
get a drink of water

1608
01:03:50,227 --> 01:03:52,027
and we just talk about stuff.

1609
01:03:52,029 --> 01:03:55,030
I am actually quite astonished
at who I was lucky enough

1610
01:03:55,032 --> 01:03:58,066
to find for my podcast
this week.

1611
01:03:58,068 --> 01:03:59,601
- That's right.
- Tracy.

1612
01:03:59,603 --> 01:04:01,204
- Tracy Morgan.
- Genius.

1613
01:04:01,205 --> 01:04:05,941
That's what they told me
I had in the Bronx.

1614
01:04:05,943 --> 01:04:08,577
I had genius in my mouth.

1615
01:04:08,579 --> 01:04:10,979
Nice, I got you goin' on it.

1616
01:04:10,981 --> 01:04:12,614
So now I got, what,
6 or 7,000 people

1617
01:04:12,616 --> 01:04:15,350
that listen to it every day,
costs them nothing,

1618
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:17,652
costs me nothing to produce,
except my time

1619
01:04:17,654 --> 01:04:19,855
and I'm literally talking
to people who are all

1620
01:04:19,857 --> 01:04:21,089
my personal friends.

1621
01:04:21,091 --> 01:04:22,591
- Who's your friend?
- You.

1622
01:04:22,593 --> 01:04:25,360
You're my friend
and you're my friend.

1623
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:27,429
I love this guy.

1624
01:04:27,431 --> 01:04:29,531
- I'm a moron!
- Don't worry.

1625
01:04:29,533 --> 01:04:32,000
I've got a plan
that's gonna solve this biz.

1626
01:04:32,002 --> 01:04:34,135
Homies help homies, always.

1627
01:04:34,137 --> 01:04:37,305
I'm ready to hear
your plan, homey.

1628
01:04:37,307 --> 01:04:38,940
You know, I do a lot
of on camera gigs

1629
01:04:38,942 --> 01:04:41,076
where everyone does
the shtick and the b-roll

1630
01:04:41,078 --> 01:04:42,177
about how they love each other.

1631
01:04:42,179 --> 01:04:43,612
It's such a bullshit.

1632
01:04:43,614 --> 01:04:45,480
The truth is in voiceovers

1633
01:04:45,482 --> 01:04:46,915
you really do love each other.

1634
01:04:46,917 --> 01:04:48,550
And they're--
it's just good people.

1635
01:04:48,552 --> 01:04:51,019
And I don't know if it's
because you're not seen

1636
01:04:51,021 --> 01:04:53,188
and you don't get the--
the acclaim,

1637
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:54,723
I don't know if that's
the component

1638
01:04:54,725 --> 01:04:57,959
that makes everyone so kind,
but they really are good people.

1639
01:04:57,961 --> 01:04:59,794
This is one of the rare mediums

1640
01:04:59,796 --> 01:05:01,796
where people do
refer you for jobs.

1641
01:05:01,798 --> 01:05:03,298
Most of the jobs I get
are references

1642
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:06,167
from other voiceover actors;
that never happens.

1643
01:05:06,169 --> 01:05:07,469
Or you don't get a job
and you say,

1644
01:05:07,471 --> 01:05:09,204
"You know who would
be good for this?"

1645
01:05:09,206 --> 01:05:11,806
Not me, but, you know,
Nika Futterman would be better

1646
01:05:11,808 --> 01:05:13,141
"or so and so would be better."

1647
01:05:13,143 --> 01:05:15,977
That never happens,
but it happens here.

1648
01:05:15,979 --> 01:05:19,214
Jim, I challenge you
to a Tyson fight.

1649
01:05:19,216 --> 01:05:21,583
It will be indubitably good.

1650
01:05:21,585 --> 01:05:24,819
♪

1651
01:05:24,821 --> 01:05:28,089
In a sense what we have here

1652
01:05:28,091 --> 01:05:30,325
is a failure to exacerbate.

1653
01:05:30,327 --> 01:05:31,893
Don't look at--
don't laugh at me.

1654
01:05:31,895 --> 01:05:33,595
I'll crush you like
a Hostess Twinkie.

1655
01:05:33,597 --> 01:05:37,399
I will get truly righteous
and put hurts on him

1656
01:05:37,401 --> 01:05:39,601
that will show up
in his grandchildren.

1657
01:05:39,603 --> 01:05:42,904
I think Jim's, Jim's Tyson's
a lot better than mine.

1658
01:05:42,906 --> 01:05:44,572
He's amazing,
he's like the everyman,

1659
01:05:44,574 --> 01:05:45,807
he's all over the place.

1660
01:05:45,809 --> 01:05:47,175
And you know what?

1661
01:05:47,177 --> 01:05:48,944
He's so talented
you can't even stand it.

1662
01:05:48,946 --> 01:05:50,979
Jim Cummings, I know,
I forfeit.

1663
01:05:50,981 --> 01:05:52,847
I gotta forfeit because
Jim would win, I think.

1664
01:05:52,849 --> 01:05:55,917
I think the camaraderie
stems from the fact

1665
01:05:55,919 --> 01:05:58,253
that no one ever
sees our faces.

1666
01:05:58,255 --> 01:06:00,455
In voiceover you find
a lot of people have

1667
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:02,891
a little bit less of an ego
because if you--

1668
01:06:02,893 --> 01:06:04,125
if you love what you're doing,

1669
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:06,461
you don't need that validation.

1670
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:08,129
We've seen--we grew up
on these cartoons,

1671
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:09,764
we think this can be
an art form

1672
01:06:09,766 --> 01:06:11,299
as well as entertainment.

1673
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:15,971
The future of animation
and voiceover has expanded

1674
01:06:15,973 --> 01:06:17,639
into so many realms.

1675
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:19,040
Now it's all over.

1676
01:06:19,042 --> 01:06:21,376
There's Adult Swim,
there's flash animation

1677
01:06:21,378 --> 01:06:24,079
with "South Park" where it's
two guys doing everything.

1678
01:06:24,081 --> 01:06:27,449
Or there's video games
where it's 17 guys

1679
01:06:27,451 --> 01:06:30,418
from the Bay Area, you know,
screaming their guts out

1680
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:32,687
making these characters
that people are gonna play

1681
01:06:32,689 --> 01:06:34,723
for nine hours straight.

1682
01:06:34,725 --> 01:06:37,392
The big thing about
the progression in voiceovers

1683
01:06:37,394 --> 01:06:38,860
is video games.

1684
01:06:38,862 --> 01:06:41,763
♪

1685
01:06:41,765 --> 01:06:47,135
But at last, the whole of
Azeroth will break.

1686
01:06:47,137 --> 01:06:49,571
The actors play
a very crucial role

1687
01:06:49,573 --> 01:06:51,439
in video games, especially,
with casting and recording

1688
01:06:51,441 --> 01:06:53,641
because we will spend a lot
of time on the front end.

1689
01:06:53,643 --> 01:06:55,243
We'll have lots
of brainstorming meetings,

1690
01:06:55,245 --> 01:06:56,911
we'll look at lots
of concept art,

1691
01:06:56,913 --> 01:06:58,513
we'll do all this
extensive work.

1692
01:06:58,515 --> 01:07:00,181
We work on our story,
we do everything

1693
01:07:00,183 --> 01:07:03,151
we possibly can,
and then we come to the booth

1694
01:07:03,153 --> 01:07:05,286
with our idea
and knowing what we want.

1695
01:07:05,288 --> 01:07:07,756
And then this magical equation
walks through the door

1696
01:07:07,758 --> 01:07:09,991
and that's the actor.

1697
01:07:09,993 --> 01:07:12,227
Right now video games
is really dominating

1698
01:07:12,229 --> 01:07:13,528
entertainment in general.

1699
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:16,564
It does take a huge
group of people

1700
01:07:16,566 --> 01:07:18,299
to create these,
probably to a certain degree,

1701
01:07:18,301 --> 01:07:19,667
maybe more than some movies.

1702
01:07:19,669 --> 01:07:22,704
If you've ever seen
the making of "Avatar,"

1703
01:07:22,706 --> 01:07:23,938
that's how games are made.

1704
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:25,940
I can't know the whole picture

1705
01:07:25,942 --> 01:07:27,375
doing a video game.

1706
01:07:27,377 --> 01:07:29,310
I mean, I can't know
the whole story line.

1707
01:07:29,312 --> 01:07:31,312
It's impossible for you to--
and sometimes it's like,

1708
01:07:31,314 --> 01:07:33,214
"Oh, my God, how am
I gonna explain this?"

1709
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:36,217
The universes are just
so huge and the amount

1710
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:39,187
of information that they
need to record

1711
01:07:39,189 --> 01:07:42,223
is so massive because
there are so many variables

1712
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:44,692
in the course of game play.

1713
01:07:44,694 --> 01:07:45,960
Go, go, go!

1714
01:07:45,962 --> 01:07:47,695
A lot of people
might know that one.

1715
01:07:47,697 --> 01:07:49,531
Uh, get down!

1716
01:07:49,533 --> 01:07:50,465
Frag out!

1717
01:07:50,467 --> 01:07:51,132
Grenade!

1718
01:07:51,134 --> 01:07:52,167
That--that's me.

1719
01:07:52,169 --> 01:07:53,401
You can't teach that,

1720
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:55,170
you can only hope
to duplicate it.

1721
01:07:55,172 --> 01:07:58,106
There's been an evolution
of video games, of the visuals.

1722
01:07:58,108 --> 01:07:59,707
You know, the visuals were
very primitive in the beginning

1723
01:07:59,709 --> 01:08:01,276
and they're getting better
and better and better,

1724
01:08:01,278 --> 01:08:03,244
especially as we get
more MoCap and stuff.

1725
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:06,481
The acting has evolved
as the visuals have evolved

1726
01:08:06,483 --> 01:08:10,685
and we're allowed to be
much, much more true.

1727
01:08:10,687 --> 01:08:15,256
You know, thousands of lines,
you know, session after session.

1728
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:18,993
Gandalf was,
he went to the north.

1729
01:08:18,995 --> 01:08:20,395
He went to the south.

1730
01:08:20,397 --> 01:08:22,097
He went to the northeast.

1731
01:08:22,099 --> 01:08:23,465
He went to the southwest.

1732
01:08:23,467 --> 01:08:24,766
He went, you know,
you have to do

1733
01:08:24,768 --> 01:08:26,401
every freakin' possibility.

1734
01:08:26,403 --> 01:08:29,938
You'll spend four hours there
with scripts that big

1735
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:31,306
screaming your guts out.

1736
01:08:31,308 --> 01:08:33,341
"Well, we want a scream
when you're bleeding."

1737
01:08:33,343 --> 01:08:35,176
We want a scream
when you're hot.

1738
01:08:35,178 --> 01:08:37,011
"We want a scream
when you're sad."

1739
01:08:37,013 --> 01:08:38,847
"Give us now a 10 second fall."

1740
01:08:38,849 --> 01:08:40,048
Okay, a 20 second fall.

1741
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:41,416
Okay, now you've been shot.

1742
01:08:41,418 --> 01:08:42,884
Okay, now your leg's
been hacked off

1743
01:08:42,886 --> 01:08:44,486
"and somebody's shoving it
down your throat."

1744
01:08:44,488 --> 01:08:47,822
We have pages and pages
of reactions.

1745
01:08:47,824 --> 01:08:50,091
I mean, when you're
going through the game

1746
01:08:50,093 --> 01:08:51,559
and you're playing
and you hear this:

1747
01:08:51,561 --> 01:08:53,895
[grunting]

1748
01:08:53,897 --> 01:08:57,031
Like, you're recording every
single one of those things.

1749
01:08:57,033 --> 01:09:00,068
You'll have short hit reaction,

1750
01:09:00,070 --> 01:09:02,670
medium hit reaction,
long hit reaction,

1751
01:09:02,672 --> 01:09:05,273
short taking damage a--
you know, so we actually

1752
01:09:05,275 --> 01:09:08,710
go down and [grunting].

1753
01:09:08,712 --> 01:09:11,012
For pages.

1754
01:09:11,014 --> 01:09:13,681
I knew you'd make it, Marcus.

1755
01:09:13,683 --> 01:09:15,950
Normally you try and get
video games scheduled

1756
01:09:15,952 --> 01:09:18,486
at the end of the week
because there's so much to do

1757
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:21,322
within a video game
voiceover-wise

1758
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:23,958
that you'll need the weekend
to recover.

1759
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,827
So, remember, this is where
you're gonna just

1760
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:27,662
totally peak at this point.

1761
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:29,631
You just lost Dom.

1762
01:09:29,633 --> 01:09:30,698
You're done?

1763
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,700
Everywhere you go,
everything you do,

1764
01:09:32,702 --> 01:09:34,802
it's always nothing but death,

1765
01:09:34,804 --> 01:09:36,004
pain, and misery.

1766
01:09:36,006 --> 01:09:39,140
I just lost my [bleep] brother!

1767
01:09:39,142 --> 01:09:40,542
You hear that!

1768
01:09:40,544 --> 01:09:42,343
My brother!

1769
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:46,080
You and your tower
can go to hell.

1770
01:09:46,082 --> 01:09:47,782
Nice.

1771
01:09:47,784 --> 01:09:51,452
Let's try one where you're
peaking right at the end.

1772
01:09:51,454 --> 01:09:52,020
Got it.

1773
01:09:52,022 --> 01:09:53,721
One second.

1774
01:09:53,723 --> 01:09:57,158
It's always nothing but
death, pain, and misery.

1775
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:00,929
I just lost my [bleep]
brother, all right?

1776
01:10:00,931 --> 01:10:02,096
You hear that!

1777
01:10:02,098 --> 01:10:03,565
My brother!

1778
01:10:03,567 --> 01:10:07,268
You and your tower
and all this [bleep] emulsion

1779
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:09,304
can go to hell.

1780
01:10:09,306 --> 01:10:10,972
Literally I've had
friends of mine who've

1781
01:10:10,974 --> 01:10:12,941
done that stuff and
come out of there going

1782
01:10:12,943 --> 01:10:15,310
"Oh my God, that session
was impossible."

1783
01:10:15,312 --> 01:10:17,378
I don't know how
I'm gonna work tomorrow.

1784
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:20,481
The Batman sound when I first
started producing it

1785
01:10:20,483 --> 01:10:22,550
and I just scrunched down
on my vocal cords

1786
01:10:22,552 --> 01:10:24,319
and I made this sound,
it was really sexy

1787
01:10:24,321 --> 01:10:25,920
and really tough
and really great.

1788
01:10:25,922 --> 01:10:29,657
Well, after a few weeks
of that my voice was goin'.

1789
01:10:29,659 --> 01:10:32,527
I go, "Wow, this is--
this is a problem."

1790
01:10:32,529 --> 01:10:35,330
So I had to figure out a way
to create the same sound

1791
01:10:35,332 --> 01:10:36,397
but supporting it.

1792
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:37,999
Which is what you do on stage,

1793
01:10:38,001 --> 01:10:39,767
but I hadn't thought
it would really be an issue

1794
01:10:39,769 --> 01:10:42,570
because there wasn't
any projecting involved.

1795
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:44,973
So you do have to keep
your voice in shape.

1796
01:10:44,975 --> 01:10:46,040
Unique New York,
unique New York,

1797
01:10:46,042 --> 01:10:46,908
unique New York.

1798
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:50,278
[tongue exercises]

1799
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:56,884
Okay.

1800
01:10:56,886 --> 01:10:58,286
I sing.

1801
01:10:58,288 --> 01:10:59,587
I sing on the way to work

1802
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:00,989
and I sing on the
way home from work.

1803
01:11:00,991 --> 01:11:02,890
If you--if you warm up properly

1804
01:11:02,892 --> 01:11:04,058
you're not gonna get hurt,

1805
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:06,094
and if you warm down properly

1806
01:11:06,096 --> 01:11:07,462
you're not gonna get hurt.

1807
01:11:07,464 --> 01:11:09,030
It is an instrument,
so just like anything

1808
01:11:09,032 --> 01:11:11,766
you wanna keep it warmed up
and have your session when

1809
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:14,335
your voice isn't too tired
'cause you can't do,

1810
01:11:14,337 --> 01:11:16,504
you can't curl
the heaviest weights

1811
01:11:16,506 --> 01:11:18,072
if your muscle's fatigued.

1812
01:11:18,074 --> 01:11:19,507
The same with your voice.

1813
01:11:19,509 --> 01:11:20,875
You can't go to
a football game and scream

1814
01:11:20,877 --> 01:11:23,278
and then expect to get
behind a microphone

1815
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,879
and have your instrument
work for ya.

1816
01:11:24,881 --> 01:11:27,749
I've known guys
with bleeding vocal cords

1817
01:11:27,751 --> 01:11:29,517
because of the work
they've had to do.

1818
01:11:29,519 --> 01:11:31,986
There are guys that have
lost their voice

1819
01:11:31,988 --> 01:11:33,988
and weren't supposed to talk
for a month.

1820
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:37,358
If I've injured my throat,
if I've overworked my voice,

1821
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,560
there's something called
entertainer's secret,

1822
01:11:39,562 --> 01:11:40,728
it's just an herbal thing.

1823
01:11:40,730 --> 01:11:42,196
You spray, you breathe,
it feels good.

1824
01:11:42,198 --> 01:11:43,765
Alcolol.

1825
01:11:43,767 --> 01:11:45,833
Not alcohol, alcolol.

1826
01:11:45,835 --> 01:11:48,102
It's been around since
the late 1800s,

1827
01:11:48,104 --> 01:11:50,471
it's a throat rinse.

1828
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:53,541
Well, I have at least
half a bottle of whiskey

1829
01:11:53,543 --> 01:11:57,412
every night, two cigars,
and a pack of cigarettes.

1830
01:11:57,414 --> 01:11:59,914
I see the words
"blood curdling scream"

1831
01:11:59,916 --> 01:12:02,984
in front of me
five times a day, for real,

1832
01:12:02,986 --> 01:12:05,887
on a good day; sometimes 20
times a day, okay?

1833
01:12:05,889 --> 01:12:07,622
And when they say
"blood curdling scream"

1834
01:12:07,624 --> 01:12:08,723
that's what they want.

1835
01:12:08,725 --> 01:12:10,325
I've figured out a way to yell

1836
01:12:10,327 --> 01:12:12,627
that isn't
as strenuous as it seems

1837
01:12:12,629 --> 01:12:14,729
and it's all about
working the mic, you know?

1838
01:12:14,731 --> 01:12:17,699
It's like, as opposed to,
you know, if I yell,

1839
01:12:17,701 --> 01:12:20,134
it's like aaahhh,
it sounds like it's really loud,

1840
01:12:20,136 --> 01:12:22,537
but it's not,
I'm kind of containing it.

1841
01:12:22,539 --> 01:12:24,505
And it's the same with like,
movie trailers when I do

1842
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:26,007
movie trailers
and you're doing that whole,

1843
01:12:26,009 --> 01:12:28,843
you know, "Rated R.
Coming to a theater near you."

1844
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:30,945
It's like, it doesn't sound
that big,

1845
01:12:30,947 --> 01:12:34,015
but when you're on a mic
it sounds huge.

1846
01:12:34,017 --> 01:12:35,550
♪

1847
01:12:35,552 --> 01:12:37,819
There's nothing wrong
with your television set.

1848
01:12:37,821 --> 01:12:40,588
Do not attempt
to adjust your picture.

1849
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:42,990
We are controlling
the transmission.

1850
01:12:42,992 --> 01:12:45,993
This is my voice...

1851
01:12:45,995 --> 01:12:48,262
...on TV.

1852
01:12:48,264 --> 01:12:49,931
Dad, you're ruining the mood!

1853
01:12:49,933 --> 01:12:51,933
There's a certain
distance that you wanna be

1854
01:12:51,935 --> 01:12:53,801
and if you're too close
it's gonna be--

1855
01:12:53,803 --> 01:12:57,572
but there's an awareness
of what that mic can pick up.

1856
01:12:57,574 --> 01:13:00,041
And you can,
I can learn sensitivities

1857
01:13:00,043 --> 01:13:02,510
to that so I can do,
play around with my voice

1858
01:13:02,512 --> 01:13:05,279
a little bit more,
get more out of it.

1859
01:13:05,281 --> 01:13:08,449
If I go, "Pah,"
see how that moves?

1860
01:13:08,451 --> 01:13:11,052
It hits the microphone
really hard.

1861
01:13:11,054 --> 01:13:12,453
That's called a P pop.

1862
01:13:12,455 --> 01:13:15,523
If you're recording
and you get a P pop

1863
01:13:15,525 --> 01:13:19,160
you take a pencil
or your finger,

1864
01:13:19,162 --> 01:13:21,396
"Pah, pah, pah, pah."

1865
01:13:21,398 --> 01:13:22,497
It splits it.

1866
01:13:22,499 --> 01:13:24,198
It makes the air go that way,

1867
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:27,802
instead of that way.

1868
01:13:27,804 --> 01:13:29,504
Locust!

1869
01:13:29,506 --> 01:13:31,038
Hit it, Dizzy!

1870
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,373
Omega two is online.

1871
01:13:32,375 --> 01:13:34,075
We're pinned down
near the museum.

1872
01:13:34,077 --> 01:13:38,579
Request evac.

1873
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:39,881
Omega two is online.

1874
01:13:39,883 --> 01:13:41,949
We're pinned down
near the museum.

1875
01:13:41,951 --> 01:13:43,251
Request evac.

1876
01:13:43,253 --> 01:13:45,853
Each of us have our own
particular bits.

1877
01:13:45,855 --> 01:13:48,589
Some riff on particular
things that are funny.

1878
01:13:48,591 --> 01:13:51,058
I mean, like, I like to...

1879
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:52,760
[cricket chirping]

1880
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:54,228
You can always put
a cricket in somewhere

1881
01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:55,496
and it seems funny.

1882
01:13:55,498 --> 01:13:58,699
[broken speech]

1883
01:13:58,701 --> 01:14:00,935
Fred Tatasciore is
really good at that too.

1884
01:14:00,937 --> 01:14:04,205
He goes, "Uh... so I w--"

1885
01:14:04,207 --> 01:14:05,506
You know, it's like...

1886
01:14:05,508 --> 01:14:07,108
We love doing
that kind of stuff.

1887
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:10,478
[broken speech]

1888
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:11,846
Sorry, man.

1889
01:14:11,848 --> 01:14:13,649
That's when I just
take 'em off.

1890
01:14:13,650 --> 01:14:15,249
Then when they're actually
trying to perform

1891
01:14:15,251 --> 01:14:18,352
just hit the button.

1892
01:14:18,354 --> 01:14:21,522
Voiceover acting
is the best kept secret

1893
01:14:21,524 --> 01:14:23,858
in Hollywood that's now
sort of starting

1894
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:26,494
to get out there.

1895
01:14:26,496 --> 01:14:29,096
It's great-- it's a great gig.

1896
01:14:29,098 --> 01:14:31,132
And people are--
people are onto it, you know?

1897
01:14:31,134 --> 01:14:33,334
For a while people didn't
really know that

1898
01:14:33,336 --> 01:14:36,838
it was such a big industry
out there, but now the uh,

1899
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,639
competition--the competition
is getting tough,

1900
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:40,374
and more and more people
are going up for--

1901
01:14:40,376 --> 01:14:41,642
going up for those jobs.

1902
01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:42,977
I think it should
definitely be more

1903
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:44,078
about talent and skill.

1904
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,646
I mean, I think the person

1905
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:48,216
should obviously bring
something to the piece.

1906
01:14:48,218 --> 01:14:52,887
I've relied several times
"Oh, maybe they'll know my name"

1907
01:14:52,889 --> 01:14:55,389
because I've been too lazy
to do a great job in there,

1908
01:14:55,391 --> 01:14:58,025
and that doesn't really work.

1909
01:14:58,027 --> 01:15:01,062
I understand that in
the selling of the thing

1910
01:15:01,064 --> 01:15:03,464
they're trying to do,
the powers that be

1911
01:15:03,466 --> 01:15:04,932
always want celebrities.

1912
01:15:04,934 --> 01:15:08,503
But the fact is celebrities
can be good, can be bad.

1913
01:15:08,505 --> 01:15:10,538
But when you're doing
something as fast paced

1914
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:12,807
as the animation that we do
for "Futurama"

1915
01:15:12,809 --> 01:15:15,776
and for "Simpsons,"
just slowing down enough

1916
01:15:15,778 --> 01:15:17,545
to say a celebrity's name,

1917
01:15:17,547 --> 01:15:19,313
"Oh my gosh, it's so and so"

1918
01:15:19,315 --> 01:15:20,915
slows things down.

1919
01:15:20,917 --> 01:15:24,018
Generally these days
if we have a celebrity

1920
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:25,820
we try to have them
play a character.

1921
01:15:25,822 --> 01:15:27,188
Like, that's my preference.

1922
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:31,492
And--and um,
you know, I'd rather work

1923
01:15:31,494 --> 01:15:34,729
with the regular
voice actors, myself.

1924
01:15:34,731 --> 01:15:39,133
Somewhere or everywhere
there's a 19 year old firebrand

1925
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:40,902
who's sitting there going,
"Wait a minute, I wanna do"

1926
01:15:40,904 --> 01:15:43,037
what Rob Paulsen does,
I wanna do what

1927
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:44,205
"Jimmy Cummings does."

1928
01:15:44,207 --> 01:15:45,840
And it's like,
"You mean I have to go"

1929
01:15:45,842 --> 01:15:49,810
be a celebrity first
and maybe win a few Oscars

1930
01:15:49,812 --> 01:15:52,613
or Emmys and then
they'll let me audition

1931
01:15:52,615 --> 01:15:54,682
"for a cartoon?"

1932
01:15:54,684 --> 01:15:57,184
You know, so it seems
weird to me.

1933
01:15:57,186 --> 01:15:59,120
I have seen
what it's like, you know,

1934
01:15:59,122 --> 01:16:02,123
I've hung out with
the absolute pinnacle

1935
01:16:02,125 --> 01:16:04,158
of you know,
somebody who's famous

1936
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:07,295
pretty much every square inch
of this planet.

1937
01:16:07,297 --> 01:16:09,530
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
there it is,

1938
01:16:09,532 --> 01:16:10,698
there's Tom right there.

1939
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:12,133
I'm Tom Hanks.

1940
01:16:12,135 --> 01:16:14,168
I've traveled with Tom
and stuff like that

1941
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:16,837
and I see the crap
that he goes through,

1942
01:16:16,839 --> 01:16:18,973
but he's incredibly
gracious about it,

1943
01:16:18,975 --> 01:16:20,875
I mean, it's mind blowing.

1944
01:16:20,877 --> 01:16:22,710
But not being able to go to
Third Street Promenade

1945
01:16:22,712 --> 01:16:25,046
without getting mobbed?

1946
01:16:25,048 --> 01:16:26,414
That's--

1947
01:16:26,416 --> 01:16:28,282
I think at times these people

1948
01:16:28,284 --> 01:16:32,086
regard voice work as kinda
like being Clark Kent.

1949
01:16:32,088 --> 01:16:33,988
You don't know that
I'm really Scooby Doo,

1950
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:36,724
you don't know that
I'm really Superman.

1951
01:16:36,726 --> 01:16:38,492
You have that little thing
tucked away,

1952
01:16:38,494 --> 01:16:39,760
you have that little confidence

1953
01:16:39,762 --> 01:16:40,962
and you bring it out
if you need to.

1954
01:16:40,964 --> 01:16:42,964
When you step into that booth

1955
01:16:42,966 --> 01:16:45,132
and you activate these
superpowers

1956
01:16:45,134 --> 01:16:47,101
that you may have,
which could be acting,

1957
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:49,737
it could be, you know,
making funny sounds

1958
01:16:49,739 --> 01:16:51,973
or it could be dialects,
it could be singing,

1959
01:16:51,975 --> 01:16:53,808
but suddenly you're transformed

1960
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:56,611
into this super being that um,

1961
01:16:56,613 --> 01:16:58,312
that nobody knows,
it's the secret

1962
01:16:58,314 --> 01:17:01,716
superhero life,
and then once you're done,

1963
01:17:01,718 --> 01:17:03,184
you know, doing your show,

1964
01:17:03,186 --> 01:17:06,087
saving the world in the show,
then you go home.

1965
01:17:06,089 --> 01:17:08,656
You step out of the booth
and you put back on

1966
01:17:08,658 --> 01:17:11,258
your Clark Kent glasses
and you go back

1967
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:12,827
to your normal existence.

1968
01:17:12,829 --> 01:17:14,295
It's pretty cool.

1969
01:17:14,297 --> 01:17:18,532
It's really nice to be,
to just be out amongst

1970
01:17:18,534 --> 01:17:20,234
and just be anonymous.

1971
01:17:20,236 --> 01:17:24,071
'Cause you really are
a part of the world.

1972
01:17:24,073 --> 01:17:25,740
Shut up!

1973
01:17:25,742 --> 01:17:27,875
Stop talking, puny man!

1974
01:17:27,877 --> 01:17:30,911
Voiceover people are,
for the most part,

1975
01:17:30,913 --> 01:17:33,180
different people because
we're people that like

1976
01:17:33,182 --> 01:17:35,850
to be anonymous and so
it isn't about ego.

1977
01:17:35,852 --> 01:17:38,452
And it maybe for some people
that kinda sounds like BS,

1978
01:17:38,454 --> 01:17:42,690
but I really mean it,
I really mean that it's about

1979
01:17:42,692 --> 01:17:44,759
a bunch of people
who are really psyched

1980
01:17:44,761 --> 01:17:47,061
that we get paid to have fun.

1981
01:17:47,063 --> 01:17:48,863
I love it because
I have friends that are,

1982
01:17:48,865 --> 01:17:50,798
you know,
I have a lot of friends

1983
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,768
that are recognizable,
so I'm really cool.

1984
01:17:53,770 --> 01:17:55,336
No, but, you know,
we can't go to Disneyland.

1985
01:17:55,338 --> 01:17:57,238
I was like, "Hey, do you wanna
go to Disneyland with our kids"

1986
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:59,306
and they're like, "I can't
really go to Disneyland."

1987
01:17:59,308 --> 01:18:00,875
And it's like, "Oh, yeah,
that sucks."

1988
01:18:00,877 --> 01:18:02,677
Disneyland is awesome."

1989
01:18:02,679 --> 01:18:04,045
So I went to Florida
where my mom is and said,

1990
01:18:04,047 --> 01:18:05,746
"I'm gonna take you
to Disneyworld."

1991
01:18:05,748 --> 01:18:07,882
And this little boy's
standing there

1992
01:18:07,884 --> 01:18:10,284
and he's wearing
an "Animaniacs" shirt, right?

1993
01:18:10,286 --> 01:18:12,520
And I go, "Yeah, I you know,
I like 'em too."

1994
01:18:12,522 --> 01:18:15,022
It's funny that you,
you know, you have that shirt

1995
01:18:15,024 --> 01:18:18,959
"'cause uh, you know,
I do the voice."

1996
01:18:18,961 --> 01:18:19,794
Right?

1997
01:18:19,796 --> 01:18:21,729
And he goes, he goes...

1998
01:18:21,731 --> 01:18:23,097
"What? What do you mean?"

1999
01:18:23,099 --> 01:18:26,701
And I go, "I do the voice
of Wakko" right?

2000
01:18:26,703 --> 01:18:29,737
And he goes, "So what?
So do I."

2001
01:18:29,739 --> 01:18:30,805
For real.

2002
01:18:30,807 --> 01:18:32,673
And I go, "Oh, no, no, no",

2003
01:18:32,675 --> 01:18:33,941
I don't mean, like, for fun,

2004
01:18:33,943 --> 01:18:36,577
"I mean I do it on
the show," right?

2005
01:18:36,579 --> 01:18:40,014
And he goes,
"Pft, no you don't."

2006
01:18:40,016 --> 01:18:41,949
And I go, "Hey, wait a minute,"
I go, "Look at this."

2007
01:18:41,951 --> 01:18:43,584
And I had this card
at the time that had

2008
01:18:43,586 --> 01:18:45,352
me and Wakko because
it was my first series,

2009
01:18:45,354 --> 01:18:47,555
I was very excited,
it had me and Wakko.

2010
01:18:47,557 --> 01:18:49,056
And I go, "Look at that, huh?"

2011
01:18:49,058 --> 01:18:51,625
And he goes, "Oh, yeah,
you got a picture"

2012
01:18:51,627 --> 01:18:53,160
of the character,
so, obviously,

2013
01:18:53,162 --> 01:18:55,529
"I'm so sorry
I didn't believe you."

2014
01:18:55,531 --> 01:18:58,032
And I'm like, I wanna,
now I wanna kill him, right?

2015
01:18:58,034 --> 01:19:00,301
And I go, "What will it take
for me to convince you?"

2016
01:19:00,303 --> 01:19:03,337
He goes, "Well, let me
hear you do it," right?

2017
01:19:03,339 --> 01:19:05,239
And dude, I never get
nervous about anything.

2018
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:08,542
I was so nervous now
'cause this little bastard!

2019
01:19:08,544 --> 01:19:15,116
And I'm like, oh uh, okay,
and I go, "Well," I go uh,

2020
01:19:15,118 --> 01:19:18,486
"Boy, it sure is great
to be here in Disneyworld.

2021
01:19:18,488 --> 01:19:20,755
"Happy Thanksgiving," right?

2022
01:19:20,757 --> 01:19:22,923
And he looks up at me
and he goes,

2023
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:26,694
"I do it way better than that."

2024
01:19:26,696 --> 01:19:30,197
I live in New York
and um, I uh,

2025
01:19:30,199 --> 01:19:33,868
after the uh, the attacks
on 9/11 we're getting

2026
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:36,270
all these, you know,
hundreds of meals ready

2027
01:19:36,272 --> 01:19:38,205
and this one guy
in the middle of the night

2028
01:19:38,207 --> 01:19:41,675
like, three nights into this
he goes, "So, my day job is"

2029
01:19:41,677 --> 01:19:42,977
I'm an architect."

2030
01:19:42,979 --> 01:19:44,211
He says, "What's your day job?"

2031
01:19:44,213 --> 01:19:46,180
I said, "Well,
I do voices mostly."

2032
01:19:46,182 --> 01:19:47,248
"I knew it!"

2033
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:49,517
He said, "You're the guy
who does Batman!"

2034
01:19:49,519 --> 01:19:50,951
You're that Kevin Conroy."

2035
01:19:50,953 --> 01:19:53,087
So he goes into this dining hall
and this is, you know,

2036
01:19:53,089 --> 01:19:54,522
the first week after the attack

2037
01:19:54,524 --> 01:19:58,793
and there had been
just this somber sadness.

2038
01:19:58,795 --> 01:20:00,861
And you hear him go,
"Guys, guys,"

2039
01:20:00,863 --> 01:20:03,497
you're not gonna believe who's
been cooking your dinners.

2040
01:20:03,499 --> 01:20:05,533
"It's Batman!"

2041
01:20:05,535 --> 01:20:08,769
There's this long silence
and you hear, "Bullshit"

2042
01:20:08,771 --> 01:20:09,904
from the back of the place.

2043
01:20:09,906 --> 01:20:11,172
And he said,
then someone else says,

2044
01:20:11,174 --> 01:20:14,208
"Make him prove it"
so, "Oh, this is good."

2045
01:20:14,210 --> 01:20:16,577
So I'm in the back kitchen
and I do from the back kitchen,

2046
01:20:16,579 --> 01:20:18,145
"I am vengeance."

2047
01:20:18,147 --> 01:20:19,246
I am the night.

2048
01:20:19,248 --> 01:20:21,282
"I am Batman."

2049
01:20:21,284 --> 01:20:23,050
There's this long pause
then you hear from

2050
01:20:23,052 --> 01:20:27,321
the back of the place
"Holy [bleep] that is Batman!"

2051
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:29,690
And suddenly people
were laughing.

2052
01:20:29,692 --> 01:20:32,526
And the architect who
had recognized me said,

2053
01:20:32,528 --> 01:20:35,362
"What's it feel like
to be Santa Claus?

2054
01:20:35,364 --> 01:20:37,665
'Cause that's what
just happened here."

2055
01:20:37,667 --> 01:20:41,068
I used to think I needed
to have heads snapping

2056
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:42,336
as I walked into a restaurant.

2057
01:20:42,338 --> 01:20:43,270
"It's him.

2058
01:20:43,272 --> 01:20:45,372
It's the guy from that show."

2059
01:20:45,374 --> 01:20:47,942
It just isn't that important
'cause it isn't real.

2060
01:20:47,944 --> 01:20:49,643
I'll never see
those people again.

2061
01:20:49,645 --> 01:20:54,481
And when I come to something
like Comic-Con, you know,

2062
01:20:54,483 --> 01:20:56,684
the place is loaded
with people who are

2063
01:20:56,686 --> 01:20:58,452
into the work, know what we do,

2064
01:20:58,454 --> 01:21:01,055
know what we look like,
and it's like getting

2065
01:21:01,057 --> 01:21:04,024
to turn off and on that,
that fame thing

2066
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:07,027
that my famous pals
can't turn off

2067
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:08,329
during the rest of the year.

2068
01:21:08,331 --> 01:21:10,097
I say it here
and it goes out there.

2069
01:21:10,099 --> 01:21:13,334
Um, you don't know
how many people

2070
01:21:13,336 --> 01:21:16,470
are actually watching
at any given moment, you know,

2071
01:21:16,472 --> 01:21:20,341
and to see that at least
a little bit of that

2072
01:21:20,343 --> 01:21:21,842
at Comic-Con and all the people

2073
01:21:21,844 --> 01:21:24,912
who truly are inspired.

2074
01:21:24,914 --> 01:21:26,347
You go to Comic-Con
and you realize

2075
01:21:26,349 --> 01:21:27,982
you're doing something
and these are peo--

2076
01:21:27,984 --> 01:21:29,450
they're grownups,
they're people that you

2077
01:21:29,452 --> 01:21:32,553
grew up with laughing
as well as five year olds.

2078
01:21:32,555 --> 01:21:37,424
And uh, it makes it--
it makes it really special.

2079
01:21:37,426 --> 01:21:39,260
If we go down to
the comic book store today

2080
01:21:39,262 --> 01:21:40,995
we'll get free comics
from everybody and then

2081
01:21:40,997 --> 01:21:42,863
I'll have six comics
instead of seven!

2082
01:21:42,865 --> 01:21:46,033
I've been going to Comic-Con,
this'll be my 16th year.

2083
01:21:46,035 --> 01:21:48,068
Like me and Comic-Con
are old friends.

2084
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:52,873
But Comic-Con is like the place
where nerds commune

2085
01:21:52,875 --> 01:21:54,808
in their natural habitat
without fear

2086
01:21:54,810 --> 01:21:56,877
of exterior persecution.

2087
01:21:56,879 --> 01:21:59,146
Comic-Con isn't just
this grassroots

2088
01:21:59,148 --> 01:22:03,083
marketing opportunity,
it is a place where people

and bleed for this stuff
