1
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:18,780
â™ª It's a mad, mad, mad...

2
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,353
Whoa!

3
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,189
Did you see it,
the way he went sailing right out there?

4
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,360
- He just went sailing out there.
- It was just terrible.

5
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,154
He must have been doing over 80.

6
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,407
An ambulance...
We ought to call an ambulance.

7
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,951
Look at that car.

8
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,163
He must have gone by you
doing 90 miles an hour.

9
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,791
He was passing me! I never saw
such a crazy thing in my life!

10
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,960
- Let's get down there.
- Let's go.

11
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,087
We're going down there.

12
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,298
Russell, be careful.
Remember your condition.

13
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,091
Eh!

14
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,261
Boy, the way he just
sailed out there...

15
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,598
Look out.

16
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,102
There's nobody in the car.

17
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,646
- He's right.
- What do you mean, nobody?

18
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:57,731
There he is.

19
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,733
Holy smoke!

20
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,949
How about that?
This guy's still alive.

21
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,493
He's still alive.

22
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,328
We ought to call an ambulance.

23
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,748
I don't know how he survived, the way
you went sailing right out there.

24
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,043
I'm not a doctor,
but I have some medical experience.

25
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,127
I'm a dentist.

26
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,963
Do you think you're hurt real bad?

27
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,759
Is he kidding?

28
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,178
Hold on, we're gonna get you
to a hospital.

29
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:32,474
You move me,
I'll break up in little pieces.

30
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:33,975
But what a deal.

31
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,686
Look, there's this dough, see?

32
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:40,649
There's all this dough: $350,000!

33
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,026
Do you hear what I'm saying?

34
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:46,488
$350,000!

35
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:51,159
In the park, in Rosita,
Rosita Beach State Park...

36
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:54,162
...just south of Dago in Santa Rosita.

37
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,416
It's in this box buried under this...

38
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,213
Buried under this big W.

39
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,756
You'll see it.

40
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:08,677
You'll see it under this...
under this big W.

41
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:13,098
You can't miss it, a big... a big W.

42
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:17,310
And it's been there...
And it's been laying there for 15 years.

43
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,772
He's very sick. He may die.

44
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,692
Listen. I tell you,
I'm giving it to you.

45
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,611
And don't let them kid you.
Don't let them kid you.

46
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:31,533
Don't let them give you the business
because it was mine and I paid for it...

47
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,953
...paid for every lousy buck of it.

48
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,413
But watch out.

49
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,039
Watch out for the bulls.

50
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:42,294
Lousy, stinking bulls are everywhere.

51
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,588
Bulls all over the place.

52
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,840
You just drive down and dig it up.

53
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,301
Dig it all up.

54
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,388
And then...

55
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,807
And then you fix yourselves all up.

56
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,392
Fix yourselves all up.

57
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,396
Walk down the street like a king,
back to the old neighborhood.

58
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,316
See the fellas, the dames...

59
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,611
...the dames, all with a big hello...

60
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,239
...a big hello for old Smiler.

61
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,408
Good old Smiler...

62
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,871
...everybody's friend.

63
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,583
Everybody's...

64
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:30,592
- Aunt Belle, I didn't mean to do it!
- Holy mackerel! Take it easy.

65
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,679
Please, say it don't make
any difference, Aunt Belle!

66
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,307
Please, you got to say...

67
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:41,061
You got to tell me
it don't make any difference!

68
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,730
For heaven's sake, tell him.

69
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,982
It... It don't make any difference.

70
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:12,133
That guy's dead.
You'd better believe it.

71
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,385
I believe it, all right.

72
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,721
But if he jumps up again,
I'm getting the hell out of here.

73
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:20,809
- What a routine he went through.
- Somebody ought to cover him up.

74
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,104
What are you looking at?
All I got is this sweater.

75
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,273
I got a blanket in the truck.

76
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,067
Do you think
there was anything in all that?

77
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,403
He was just raving. He flipped.

78
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:35,031
Hey. This must...
This must be the police.

79
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,659
Think we ought to tell them
what he said?

80
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,662
Don't say anything
or we'll be here all day.

81
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,540
We got to be in Vegas this afternoon.

82
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,667
I got a van of furniture to get to Yuma.

83
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,503
My wife and I are on
our second honeymoon.

84
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:52,757
My wife's up there with her mother.
We're on our way to Lake Mead.

85
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,927
What's to argue about? Just clam up.
Don't say nothing.

86
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,013
This way, we get out of here.

87
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:02,267
Are you a police officer?

88
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,276
Yep!

89
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,534
- How long ago did this happen?
- A few minutes ago.

90
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,037
About five minutes ago.

91
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:25,206
- Any of you actually see it happen?
- Well, uh...

92
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:28,543
- He passed me on the curve...
- Did anybody actually see it?

93
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,254
He was passing me
when he sailed right out there.

94
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:34,215
- Right over there, up there.
- Who was the first down here?

95
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,010
We all went down.

96
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,887
Was he dead?

97
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,722
Was he already dead?

98
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,934
I said, "Was he already dead
when you got down here?"

99
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,312
Practically.

100
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,899
He was still alive.
Did he say anything?

101
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,946
- Did he say anything before he died?
- What about?

102
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,782
What do you mean, "what about?"

103
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,785
Did he say anything
or didn't he say anything?

104
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:09,376
- He was raving, Officer.
- Raving? What about?

105
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:13,254
Well, he said...
What he said was sort of...

106
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,756
Embarrassing.

107
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,925
What was? Come on.

108
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,428
He thought
that this fellow was his aunt.

109
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,223
- His aunt?
- Yeah. His Aunt Belle.

110
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,266
Must have had an aunt
named Aunt Belle.

111
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,935
All right!

112
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,939
Did he make any kind of statement?
Any last messages?

113
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,067
He didn't make that clear at all.

114
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,736
He didn't make anything clear.
Can we get going?

115
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,738
Just a minute.

116
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,282
I'll get your names
and where you can be reached.

117
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,993
We're on our honeymoon.
We don't know where we'll be.

118
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,412
We can't stick around.

119
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:49,541
We're due in Las Vegas.
We don't know how long we'll stay there.

120
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:53,044
I got a van of furniture to get to Yuma
before I get back to...

121
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,088
We stopped to see if we could help.

122
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,298
We was too late. Let us go, okay?

123
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,218
We'll hold services for him later.
We got our lives to live.

124
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,346
- We ain't had breakfast yet.
- All right.

125
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,807
I'll have to get your name, anyway.

126
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,143
Hold it.

127
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,312
Me?

128
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:15,734
- Why?
- In case the coroner wants a statement.

129
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:20,321
J. Russell Finch,
2790 Penrose Boulevard, Fresno.

130
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:24,159
I won't be home for a few weeks
but you can get me through my office.

131
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,828
- What'd you say?
- Where is your office?

132
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:30,790
Pacific Edible Seaweed Company
and it's in Fresno.

133
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,543
- You can call my secretary.
- Ambulance is on its way.

134
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:34,669
Yeah.

135
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,379
- Is he dead?
- Yeah.

136
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,341
We'd better shift those cars.
They're on the curb.

137
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,844
That's all we can get from this group.

138
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,804
Thank you, gentlemen.

139
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,181
Thanks.

140
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,231
Well...

141
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,942
There's an unexpected twist for you.

142
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,653
They're not going to like this
down at Santa Rosita.

143
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,698
- Culpeper's going to scream.
- Yeah.

144
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,868
- We better get our story straight if...
- What story?

145
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,454
He woke up as usual.
He started driving his car.

146
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,080
He stopped for breakfast.

147
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,833
He went to the gents' room,
climbed out the back window.

148
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:17,796
So what? Even Culpeper can't say
we should've been in there with him.

149
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,924
What got me is the way
he went sailing out there.

150
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,303
If I have to climb much more,
I'll be laying there with him.

151
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,471
Poor soul.

152
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,104
Uh...

153
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,066
Melville, what happened?

154
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,486
We couldn't do anything for him.
Nothing we could do. Come on.

155
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,904
Well?

156
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,033
Uh...

157
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,911
- It was a terrible thing.
- Russell, I feel sick.

158
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,538
Take it easy. These things happen.

159
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:54,374
What kind of attitude is that,
"these things happen"?

160
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,627
They only happen because this country
is full of people...

161
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,588
...who, when things happen,
just say, "These things happen. "

162
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:04,425
- And that's why they happen!
- Let's try not to get upset.

163
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:05,927
Come on.

164
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,304
We got to have control
of what happens to us.

165
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,182
If we left it up to you,
we'd never hear the last of it.

166
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,935
You're right.

167
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:22,944
Do you know what those half-wit
morons up in Sacramento do about it?

168
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:26,489
They just sit there with their big feet
up on their big desk...

169
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:31,452
...milking 15 million people of...
- Listen, I want to say something.

170
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,955
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I've got to say something.

171
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,125
- What are you looking at?
- I'm watching something.

172
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,294
Benjy, turn around, sit still.

173
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:43,089
- Play it straight.
- They're not kiddin'. They went for it.

174
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,466
Yeah? What are you going to do now?

175
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:49,220
I want you to tell me everything
that man told you, word for word.

176
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,305
Don't leave out anything.

177
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,348
But do you think he really meant it?

178
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:58,563
Monica, I don't know about anybody else,
but some of them believed it.

179
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,774
Like those two back there.
Don't look over there!

180
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:05,278
I know where it is. It's under a big W.
That's what he said.

181
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,739
Like a windmill or a waterfall
or something.

182
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,617
I hope it's not under a waterfall.

183
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:13,286
Think of something that starts with a W.

184
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,997
Wealth. Which.

185
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,249
Let's see. Where.

186
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,835
Work. That's it.
I got to work on where it is.

187
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:25,256
One thing Dr. Carroll said was Russell
was to have no undue excitement...

188
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,008
...for at least two weeks
because of his condition.

189
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,968
- But...
- That's why we came on this trip...

190
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,846
...so Russell could relax.
You should have told the police.

191
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,599
You keep saying that.
What's the police got to do with it?

192
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,936
I think the police were chasing him.
They drove up so fast.

193
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:41,022
Why shouldn't they've been chasing him?
He was speeding.

194
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,024
I'm only thinking
of Russell's condition.

195
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:47,695
You mean his financial condition.
That's the only condition he has.

196
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:51,366
Do you know why your husband
had a nervous breakdown?

197
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:56,162
It's because he has sunk $40,000,
including $15,000 of my money...

198
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,749
...into a company that makes
seaweed for people to eat.

199
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:03,086
Not only does nobody like it,
it costs $4 a can.

200
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:05,380
- Yeah, but...
- "Yeah, but," what?

201
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,548
Most people like it and I like it.

202
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,926
I'm working hard,
trying to keep the costs down.

203
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,220
You were working hard
to keep the costs down...

204
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,556
...the day you ran
into the street screaming.

205
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:18,977
- Mother!
- Emmeline, shut up! And you, too!

206
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,562
Maybe he was playing
a trick on everybody.

207
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,357
Did you think about that?
He might have been a practical joker.

208
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,777
Oh... Monica! Practical!

209
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:31,572
What kind of man is going to play a
practical joke on complete strangers...

210
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,325
...with every bone in his body broken?

211
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,578
- Watch! Watchtower!
- No.

212
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:38,788
- Wall...
- No.

213
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,707
- Walnut tree.
- No, no!

214
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,000
- Walnuts.
- No!

215
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,751
- In bags.
- No!

216
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:48,131
Why are we doing only 35?
Step on it! See what happens.

217
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,299
- Mother!
- They'll see what we're doing.

218
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,427
Go ahead and try it.
What've you got to lose?

219
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,929
Mother, he's not that good a driver.

220
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,940
- Uh-huh.
- A-ha!

221
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,317
Going to leave the big boy behind?

222
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,381
What are you doing?
Why are we slowing down?

223
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,800
It's no use.
We can't lose them this way.

224
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,595
The inside of my stomach...

225
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,987
What's that idiot in the truck doing?

226
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,323
What's he doin' back there?

227
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,326
I bet he's running out of gas. Good!

228
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,293
What happened to you?

229
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,296
- Having trouble with your engine?
- Run out of gas?

230
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:56,717
- What, you bend your tailpipe?
- No. It was just one of my tires.

231
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,511
I thought...

232
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,389
Shucks! Okay, so I was trying to...

233
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,473
Rats.

234
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,101
This whole thing...
I think we're making a big mistake.

235
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,478
- I absolutely agree.
- So?

236
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,730
We're being silly
running around like this.

237
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:12,316
- Sure. We're getting nowhere.
- By george, he's right.

238
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,570
Let's do something sensible.
Let's just discuss this thing...

239
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:18,197
...and reason something out.
- I'm with you.

240
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:21,284
And we can come to some conclusion
like intelligent people.

241
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,244
Let's do that: What he said.

242
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,539
Yeah. That way nobody will have an
advantage on one another, right?

243
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,874
It's fair.

244
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,709
We'd better get the cars off that curve.

245
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,753
Let's not talk here, but over there.
There's plenty of room.

246
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,422
Fine, see you over there.

247
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,716
Over there.

248
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,053
You're through to Homicide.

249
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,266
Santa Rosita Police Station...

250
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,018
...Detective Division.

251
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,438
I'm connecting you now.
Santa Rosita Police Station.

252
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,440
Detective Division. Matthews.

253
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:56,611
No, Sheriff, the Chief isn't here.
He's a little late this morning.

254
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:59,113
I'll stay late after school. Who is it?

255
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,574
- Sheriff, Crockett County.
- Who?

256
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,452
- That's where the Smiler is.
- I wonder if anything happened.

257
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,205
Gertie, will you put
that call through here?

258
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,415
How about some coffee, Schwartz?

259
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,508
Hello, Sheriff. Culpeper.

260
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,719
What'd he do, make a break?
What happened?

261
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,804
Afraid I got some bad news.

262
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:27,058
- Grogan's cashed in his chips.
- He what?

263
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,269
He crashed his car
about 20 minutes ago.

264
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,521
He was making a break, all right.

265
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,275
How did it happen?
Where did it happen?

266
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:42,615
On 39, about 18 miles east
of Danby Junction.

267
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:46,994
- Nine miles west of Valley Center.
- Were there any witnesses?

268
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,705
A few people went down
to see if they could help.

269
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:53,000
- Was he killed outright?
- I don't know, but I can find out.

270
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,961
Do that. See what they said.

271
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,004
Thanks very much, Sheriff.

272
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,344
Well...

273
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,347
It's a great way to start the day.

274
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,600
You wait for 15 years
to solve a really important case...

275
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,102
...and just when you...

276
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,608
It's all right, Chief.
I'll get it for you.

277
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,571
He did it again.

278
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,175
Get that fella's number!
Get his number!

279
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,720
Get that fella's number!
Get his number!

280
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:55,563
Item: One large furniture
van. Item: One red Volkswagen.

281
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,940
That's them. Call in.

282
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,609
2-1-6-2, 2-1-5-8.

283
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:03,404
We just made all four of them
parked alongside the road.

284
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,073
They're standing there talking. Over.

285
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:10,328
Sammy, let that ambulance
go. And stay by the radio.

286
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:15,082
The man said there was a certain amount
of money buried in this park.

287
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,292
Under a big W.

288
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,002
What is a big W?

289
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,920
We find out, we'll send you a wire.

290
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,884
It's only a possibility
that this man was telling the truth.

291
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:30,431
If it was the truth, then it is a fact
this place is almost 200 miles away.

292
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,892
I suggest we quietly get
into our cars...

293
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:37,146
...and drive down there
at a safe, sound speed...

294
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,690
...keeping in sight of each other.

295
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:43,652
When we get there, we dig up the money,
providing there is money...

296
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,114
...and if we do find it, we share it
amongst us in a simple manner.

297
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,908
He's got a point. He's got something.

298
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:52,119
- We should go straight to the police.
- The police? Why?

299
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:56,374
It's all right, she's with us.
What's this "fair shares for everybody"?

300
00:22:56,541 --> 00:23:01,212
We arrived in four vehicles. I think
we should split it up in four quarters.

301
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:05,007
Four quarters?
What are you talking about? Quarters?

302
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:08,552
You mean you three each get a quarter
and we have to split a quarter?

303
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,055
- That's right.
- What are you trying to pull?

304
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:14,225
- Seems fair to me.
- Naturally, it's fair to you.

305
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:20,106
- It just cheats us, that's all.
- $350,000 divided by four is...

306
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,858
...let's say, $87,500.

307
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,527
That's what it is.

308
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:28,072
The three of you get $87,500
and Benjy and I have to split.

309
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,534
There was five of us down at the wreck.
We should split it five ways.

310
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:32,743
He's right. We should.

311
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,496
I'm perfectly willing to discuss it
in a five-way manner.

312
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,332
We can discuss it in a five-way manner,
five shares...

313
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,668
...each share would be $70,000...

314
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,461
$70,000?

315
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:43,671
Holy mackerel!

316
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,842
You realize how many loads
I'd have to haul from Modesto to Yuma...

317
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,427
You're overlooking one thing.

318
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,595
- We're overlooking...
- What little thing?

319
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,014
- What little thing?
- We can all count.

320
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,600
- There were eight of us.
- There were eight of us.

321
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:59,437
Speaking for my wife and myself,
we'd be just as happy...

322
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:03,149
Happy with two-eighths instead
of a quarter? Awfully big of you.

323
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:06,235
Wait a minute, hold it.
Put it back the way it was before.

324
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,612
Either one quarter for each car,

325
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,740
including the van,
or one fifth for each guy.

326
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:16,454
- Because this old bag has to stick...
- How dare you!

327
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:21,125
Chief, we got a situation here
that is absolutely incredible.

328
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,378
- Look, Smiler Grogan... Remember him?
- Yes.

329
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,214
Smiler Grogan spent the night here, see?

330
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,467
Made his break this morning.

331
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:34,013
He drove up this way, got to here,
crashed and killed himself.

332
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:37,558
But before he died,
some people stopped to help him.

333
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,853
They are now stopped here, talking.

334
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:44,064
I think they're arguing about something.

335
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:48,569
And a Crockett County unit
has got them under observation.

336
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,822
We give shares to everybody
and for everything.

337
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,908
Now, there are eight of us.

338
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,911
There's eight shares for that.
Then there were four vehicles.

339
00:24:57,078 --> 00:25:00,247
If we give four shares for that,
that's 12 shares already.

340
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,583
There were five of us
who went down to the wreck.

341
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,251
We give five shares for that.

342
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,128
That makes it 17, right?

343
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,130
Now, 17 shares and then we add...

344
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:11,133
...the same number of shares
as people in each vehicle.

345
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:14,595
Three for your group, two for yours,
two for us, and one for you.

346
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,264
That adds up to 25 shares.

347
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:22,603
25 into 350,000 is $14,000 per share.

348
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,480
Figured like that would mean...

349
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:27,942
...you'd get three shares for being
three people, one for the car...

350
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,694
...one share for going down
and looking at the wreck...

351
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:33,322
...and three for being
three more people in the car.

352
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:38,410
A total of eight shares,
giving you $112,000.

353
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:41,997
That should cover everything,
including the emancipation of women.

354
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,290
Let's see now.

355
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:46,544
I got one share for being one person...

356
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:50,130
...one share for going down the hill,
one share for the truck...

357
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,967
...one share for being a person
in the truck.

358
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:58,597
But no matter how you figure it out, I
still don't get as much as anybody else.

359
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,891
Let me explain it once more.

360
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:06,105
Their group, they, those three of them,
they get $112,000, right?

361
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:09,525
Those over there, them,
they get $97,000.

362
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:12,152
We, us, we get $84,000.

363
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,615
And you, by yourself,
you get $56,000...

364
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:17,658
...alone.

365
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,828
- That's tax-free money.
- What do you mean, tax-free?

366
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:24,957
If we go down to this park
and we uncover the money...

367
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,835
I'm sure he's not going
to declare anything.

368
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,837
I know he's not going
to declare anything.

369
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:34,508
- I'm not going to declare...
- What are you talking about, declare it?

370
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:37,261
I mean, it's like non-taxable income.

371
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,555
It's like a gift.

372
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:43,058
If we find the money,
we still have to report the taxes.

373
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:46,020
Otherwise, it's like stealing
from the government.

374
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,355
You explain it to him, please.

375
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,733
Who me?

376
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:54,653
If we find the money,
there may not be taxes to pay on it...

377
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,363
...because we found it.

378
00:26:56,531 --> 00:27:00,451
- What he was trying to say is...
- Everybody has to pay taxes.

379
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:04,830
Even businessmen that rob,
steal and cheat people every day...

380
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,665
...even they have to pay taxes.

381
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,461
I give up. Anybody got a better,
fairer plan, go ahead.

382
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:14,506
There were eight of us there,
so that simply means eight shares.

383
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:17,468
- Three for us, two for you...
- This is hopeless.

384
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,721
We'll get no place if we continue
listening to this old bag.

385
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:24,475
Lady, you trying to split us up
so every man's for himself?

386
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,060
And every woman for himself?

387
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,895
One more funny remark from you...

388
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:31,065
- Let's get out of here.
- Please, don't argue anymore.

389
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:34,526
We figured it 17 different ways.

390
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:36,904
Every time we figured it,
it was no good.

391
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:40,658
No matter how we figured it,
somebody didn't like it.

392
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:44,036
Now there's only one way to figure it.

393
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,913
And that is, every man...

394
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,707
...including the old bag, for himself!

395
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,919
- Good luck and may the best man win!
- Right!

396
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:56,090
Except you, lady.
May you just drop dead!

397
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,425
All right. We all agree on that.

398
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:03,597
Let's be sensible about this thing.
There's money in this for all of us.

399
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,934
There's enough for you.
There's enough for you...

400
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,645
...for me...

401
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,939
...and for you...

402
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,774
...and there's enough for...

403
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,027
Melville, my shoe!

404
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,946
Get in the car!

405
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:52,062
2-1-5-8, 2-1-6-2, four cars under
observation are passing this checkpoint.

406
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,064
Lead car is Plymouth station wagon.

407
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,066
Next, the Ford van, the Volkswagen...

408
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,986
...and the Chrysler Imperial
convertible, all doing about 50.

409
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,196
Yep, they're on their way.

410
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,240
All traveling
in the same direction?

411
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,033
Right. According to my boys...

412
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:08,078
...they're all
on reckless driving charges already.

413
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:12,833
None of those people must suspect
that anybody's interested in them.

414
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,377
Now, Sheriff,
will you get on to Capt. Hardesty...

415
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,963
...and see how many helicopters
he can let us have?

416
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:21,633
I'll see what we can do
and I'll call you back.

417
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:26,680
Now, where have I always told you
that the Smiler hid the dough?

418
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,766
- I know.
- Where?

419
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:32,352
- Right there.
- That's right, yeah.

420
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,355
If these merrymakers
decide to go for it...

421
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:38,400
...they'll go to the crossroads
and turn south.

422
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,862
But why did Smiler head east
when he made his break...

423
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,198
...if the money is down here somewhere?

424
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:45,574
Oh!

425
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:50,037
Aloysius, the guy is just being clever.
You can't...

426
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,289
5 will get you 10...

427
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:56,376
...they turn south at the crossroads.
- You got yourself a bet.

428
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,726
"Mount Shasta National Forest. "
Are we near...

429
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:15,521
That's on the top!
Look down near the bottom.

430
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:20,150
- Are we near Oregon?
- That's 700 miles from here.

431
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,124
Don't pass it!

432
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,050
You'll lose your license.

433
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:52,975
We've got the Imperial
and we're running last?

434
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:55,143
I can't pass them on the curves.

435
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:57,938
Go on. Go ahead. Look, there's a space!

436
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:01,024
You waiting for an engraved invitation?

437
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,652
Get over!

438
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,779
Get over to the side
where you belong!

439
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,753
I said it before and I'll say it again.

440
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,339
I didn't want to move to California.

441
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,644
- Did you find it yet?
- I can't find it anywhere.

442
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,354
Take the wheel. Give me the map.

443
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:22,397
Take the wheel! Give me the map.

444
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,817
It must be here.
Right over here. Valley Center!

445
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,110
It's right here.

446
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,862
There's an airfield not far...

447
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,698
Get it off your face!

448
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,787
- Get it off me!
- Don't go in there!

449
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,206
Swing over! Watch out!

450
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,837
- Take it off.
- Get it off!

451
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:47,589
I've had enough.

452
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,232
- They're going to hire airplanes.
- Never mind. Go!

453
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,694
- But they'll be there hours before...
- I said never mind. Let's go!

454
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,988
Nobody's getting me up in the air.

455
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:27,504
I wanted to be reasonable,
give them reasonable shares.

456
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,257
No. They wanted every man for himself.

457
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:33,343
I'm going to show them
what kind of man they're dealing with.

458
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,813
It's stalled, Benjy.
We got dust in the carburetor.

459
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:55,282
When the people who own this see this,
I sure hate to think...

460
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,576
Never mind.

461
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:58,744
Here's the bike.

462
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:01,788
Get to the nearest phone
and hire the best car you can find.

463
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:06,793
But this is a girl's bike.
This is for a little girl.

464
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:09,755
I've got to get this stuff back
so I can lock up the van.

465
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:12,674
We'll put everything away.
Will you get going? Hurry.

466
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,885
Okay.

467
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,179
I got to admit...

468
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,640
...I feel kind of silly.

469
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:22,559
You know what I mean?

470
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,695
Will you take us or won't you?

471
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:36,156
For $250, I guess I will.

472
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:40,077
You take care of the plane.
We'll leave our car here till tomorrow.

473
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,412
- I'll give you a check.
- Check?

474
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,998
Traveler's check from
the Bank of America. Don't worry.

475
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,584
- Oh, boy.
- Hey!

476
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,212
Are you a pilot?
Is there a plane around?

477
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:51,379
Right both times.

478
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:53,632
Where's an airplane? I don't see any.

479
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,675
There's only one. We've chartered it.

480
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:58,512
- So you and your friend...
- Did you make a deal with them?

481
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:01,848
- Right.
- Where can we charter another plane?

482
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,726
- Nearest place is North Valley.
- Where's that?

483
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:08,647
Other side of Valley Center,
about 12 miles, 15 miles.

484
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:11,733
- Excuse us.
- Filibuster, filibuster.

485
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,985
You can stick around
and watch us take off.

486
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:16,571
Listen, dentist. I hate dentists.

487
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:20,659
I hate you so much, I'm not able to tell
you how much in front of your wife.

488
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,577
Vice versa.

489
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:26,790
Come on over here! Come on!

490
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,636
Good morning.

491
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,805
- Good morning.
- Had an accident?

492
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,766
- Anyone hurt?
- No, but we've got to get to a phone.

493
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:47,102
Can you give us a lift?

494
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:50,188
Of course, I should be
absolutely delighted.

495
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:54,818
Upsy-daisy. I'm afraid you
caught me on the hub there.

496
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,362
Madam, do be careful.
I have some cactus specimens...

497
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,782
- Oh!
- I'm most frightfully sorry.

498
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:04,744
I've been gathering some samples
of desert flora.

499
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,413
Where shall I put this?

500
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:08,999
Boy.

501
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,961
Good morning.

502
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:16,131
It certainly is. We're in a hurry.
We've got to get to a phone.

503
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,341
Of course, with pleasure.

504
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:21,636
Jolly nasty accident there.
Jolly lucky nobody was hurt.

505
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:25,140
Where did you get that funny accent?
Are you from Harvard or something?

506
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,976
Harvard? Rather not. I'm English.

507
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,853
Sounds so foreign.

508
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,814
Really? I say,
we haven't introduced ourselves.

509
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:35,442
My name is Algernon Hawthorne...
Col. Hawthorne.

510
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,904
- You're a colonel?
- Lieutenant colonel, actually.

511
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,739
My name is Finch. This is my wife.

512
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:43,950
This is my mother-in-law, Mrs. Marcus.

513
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:46,661
Do stuff those in the back.

514
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:49,039
Cactus. It's rather a hobby of mine.

515
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,250
Spent the last 10 days
gathering some for my collection.

516
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,544
Nothing spectacular, actually.

517
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:58,048
Cereus echinocactus, opuntia.
That sort of thing.

518
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,550
Been enjoying a spot of leave
from Vandenberg.

519
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,011
- From what?
- Vandenberg.

520
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,596
The missile place.

521
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:08,141
I've been attached there
for the last 10 months. Liaison work.

522
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,936
All very hush-hush and whoosh-whoosh.

523
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,980
That sort of thing, you know.

524
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,235
Please, will you look at the road?

525
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:21,821
Yes. Whoosh-whoosh.

526
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:29,496
- Don't stop! Keep moving!
- Mother!

527
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:33,083
That big stupid lout! He ran into us.
Keep moving!

528
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:44,803
I won't fly in this old...
Listen to it.

529
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,763
Look at how it's shuddering.

530
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:50,892
Can't we go on our second honeymoon
and forget all about this?

531
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,354
Honey, please, darling.
Believe me, everything is all right.

532
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,731
Do you think I'd take a chance with you

533
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,817
if there was any danger
in flying this thing?

534
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,944
This plane is really built.

535
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,738
When was this plane built?

536
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:06,950
1916.

537
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:11,121
1916. These planes are tried and true.

538
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,873
There's nothing experimental
about these planes.

539
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:17,002
So, come on.
Let's have one big adventure.

540
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:19,546
Get up there and have some fun.
Here we go.

541
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,053
- That scratched the paint.
- Help!

542
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,200
Haven't you got another car...

543
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:51,911
What? All right. Thanks.

544
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,582
Are you sure you can't rent us
that truck? I'll pay.

545
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,500
I told you, we can't.

546
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:00,670
This is our first week open.
How could we do without our truck?

547
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,630
We're in business.

548
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:06,176
We'll have to speak to the Englishman.
If we tell him what happened...

549
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,886
How can you admit we're involved...

550
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:11,931
- He'll say he's entitled to a share.
- He would be if he drove us there.

551
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:15,101
If we don't tell him, he won't.

552
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:18,063
You're such a genius.

553
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,273
Listen! Only 10 percent!

554
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,817
There's no reason
he should expect any more!

555
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,541
Thanks for stopping.
Can you give me a lift?

556
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:42,712
What's with the kiddy bicycle?
Are you some kind of a nut?

557
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,091
No. I had an accident.
I got to get to Santa Rosita fast.

558
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:48,676
Can't help you.
I'm turning off a little way up.

559
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:50,970
Wait, let me think.

560
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:54,599
I got to tell somebody.
Could you spare a couple of hours?

561
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:55,892
Couple of hours?

562
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,354
You've been out in the sun too long.
You're starting to crack up.

563
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,314
Wait a minute. Listen.

564
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,942
Just hear me out.

565
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:08,405
What I'm gonna tell you, you just ain't
going to believe it could've happened.

566
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,074
There was an accident here
a little while back...

567
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:15,161
...about 20 miles back.
It involved $350,000.

568
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,330
Now, like I say...

569
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:21,584
...when I tell you this, you just ain't
going to believe it could've happened.

570
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,004
Try me. I'm pretty gullible.

571
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:08,798
What bothers me is this big W.

572
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:13,344
You sure you told me all you know?
You don't know what that guy meant?

573
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:16,890
No, none of them know.
It's just who gets there first.

574
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:19,267
What do you say? Is it a deal?

575
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:22,061
Um... Deal!

576
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:26,316
Kid, you better get
that bike out of there.

577
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,902
Somebody could trip over it in the dark.

578
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:53,486
Fellas, I'm glad you're here.
Look, I need your help.

579
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,989
I had this blowout.
I think a spare's in the back.

580
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:59,576
It may be a little flat.
Is there an airport anyplace around?

581
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:02,495
If the spare's flat, don't fix it.
Give me a new tire.

582
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,497
You ain't got a new tire, fix the spare.

583
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:07,917
But don't look at me, move it.
You could be gassing up.

584
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:12,130
What is it, a staring contest?
Move, move, will you? Come on!

585
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,716
The pension in my grade...

586
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:20,471
...has not been upped
one red cent since 1934.

587
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,682
Now... Uh...

588
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,977
If the Mayor
will get behind a resolution...

589
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,688
What can I do?
I can't put any pressure on the Mayor!

590
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,648
You can, Al.

591
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:32,150
That's the whole point.

592
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,527
This case,
I'll have finished by tonight.

593
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:37,905
It's one of the biggest cases
we've ever had across our books.

594
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:40,033
Tell the Mayor about it.

595
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:44,704
Tell him the money is right here,
where I always said it was...

596
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,581
...right in this neighborhood.

597
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:50,376
Tell him what credit will be reflected
upon the department.

598
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:55,006
Come on, Aloysius,
get in there and pitch for me.

599
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,300
I can try.

600
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,719
He'll listen to you.

601
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:04,390
If he gets behind this,
it'll pass unanimously.

602
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:06,225
Now, you know...

603
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:08,436
You know, Al, I got it coming.

604
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:11,230
I'll do everything I can.

605
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:13,483
- You know that, don't you?
- Yes.

606
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,861
There's just one other little thing...

607
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,905
No. Nothing.

608
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,239
Vacation.

609
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:24,243
Once I get Smiler Grogan out of the way,
my desk is clear.

610
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:29,874
I'd like to take a three-week vacation.
Take Ginger on a real nice holiday.

611
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:32,710
- Is that all right with you?
- Of course it's all right.

612
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:35,546
Thanks. I can hardly wait to tell her.

613
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:38,549
- You won't forget about the Mayor?
- No.

614
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:42,261
I'll do my best. I promise you that.

615
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:45,056
Aloysius,
I'll never forget you for this.

616
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:48,017
You know something, Al?
I got a feeling this morning...

617
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:51,270
...that everything's coming my way.

618
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,447
Sylvester!

619
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:10,456
- Why did you do that?
- Why are you shouting?

620
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:13,251
- Do you have to scare everybody?
- Are you crazy?

621
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:14,627
Why didn't I think?

622
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,754
We've been running around like lunatics.

623
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:20,633
Why didn't I think about Sylvester?
He's sitting there right now.

624
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:23,720
- He lives on Silver Strand Beach.
- I never thought of that.

625
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:26,639
- Who on earth is Sylvester?
- My son, Emmeline's brother.

626
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,224
He's a lifeguard there.

627
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:31,894
I'm not entirely certain
that you haven't damaged this machine.

628
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:40,278
Kid, don't mind polishing.
I got a lot of cars. Don't bother.

629
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:42,196
You did a good job.

630
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:44,157
Have a drink on me. Keep the change.

631
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:46,117
I took care of your buddy.
Let me go now.

632
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:47,160
You!

633
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:50,621
No! It's that lunatic
who escaped from the asylum!

634
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:53,082
Watch him! He's a homicidal maniac!

635
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,334
Get on the phone, yell "Mayday. "

636
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:57,253
Listen to me. I'm a psychiatrist.

637
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,922
This man is insane! I'm not your nurse.

638
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,340
He has a hate complex.

639
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:03,593
Calm down!

640
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:06,846
Somebody will stumble
over the bicycle in the dark, huh?

641
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:10,850
When I finish with you, they'll be
stumbling over you in the dark!

642
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,727
Get on the phone!

643
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:18,691
Look out!

644
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:21,360
Look, I was clowning.

645
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:24,447
Get out of here! Sir, wait a minute.

646
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,741
You've got this all...
Why don't you stop?

647
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,868
I tell you. I'll kill you!

648
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:33,164
You got this... Wait!

649
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:35,208
Don't take it so...

650
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:37,960
Will you stop staring and get out of...

651
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:40,671
He's out of his head.

652
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,758
- He's crazy!
- Want us to call... Ray!

653
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,427
It's a brand-new pump!

654
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:49,722
- Get out of here!
- Stop that!

655
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,058
Stop that! He's crazy!

656
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,101
Hey.

657
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:56,395
Very good. Quick thinking.
I'm proud of you.

658
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:58,356
Very good. Tie him up.

659
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:01,359
I'll have some orderlies come by
with a straitjacket.

660
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:04,237
- Very good. I'm proud of you.
- I never saw anything...

661
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:06,781
- How many people has he killed?
- There'll be more.

662
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:08,950
Tie him up for the boys
in the white jackets.

663
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:12,036
I'm proud of you, boys.
You did a real good job.

664
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:14,580
Look me up. I'm in the book.
Dr. Zillman.

665
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:19,919
- Sir, we've got to get to Santa Rosita.
- I tell you, this is a club.

666
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,213
We don't do charters.
Nobody here can take you.

667
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:26,259
- Whose plane is that?
- That belongs to Mr. Tyler Fitzgerald.

668
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:28,052
He isn't going anywhere today.

669
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:31,889
- Is he here? Can we see him?
- Mr. Fitzgerald's in the billiard room.

670
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:36,102
- He's asleep. Nobody can talk to him.
- Can we ask him a question?

671
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,104
No, you can't.

672
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,439
Hello? Wait a minute!

673
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:47,864
Come on, Benjy.
That must be Mr. Fitzgerald over there!

674
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:51,701
- You can't disturb Mr. Fitzgerald!
- We just want to talk to him.

675
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,786
- Let him rest, please.
- Hello.

676
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,037
- Sh!
- Don't shush me!

677
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,123
We're trying to talk to him.

678
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,208
Wake up, won't you please?

679
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:02,336
I think he's got a cold.

680
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:05,464
Mr. Fitzgerald, listen. Please, sir.

681
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:09,176
We hate to disturb your sleep,
but it's an emergency.

682
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:11,304
You've no right to crash in here.

683
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,099
That's a head cold.

684
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:17,768
Mr. Fitzgerald,
you know where Rosita Beach is?

685
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:21,647
- Only you can get us there.
- It's a matter of life and death.

686
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:23,566
Right, a matter of life and death.

687
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,485
- It's our grandmother. She's dying.
- Who's dying?

688
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:29,822
Our grandmother is dying
and she's sent for us.

689
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:34,327
She's in Rosita Beach.
She's dying and we're up here.

690
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:37,538
She'd like us with her when she goes.

691
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:39,665
Otherwise, she won't go.

692
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:43,169
- She'll go.
- Sir, they forced their way in here.

693
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:46,130
No, we didn't. Let me introduce myself.

694
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:48,174
I'm Dingy Bell. This is Benjy Benjamin.

695
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:51,010
- How do you do?
- Don't start with that!

696
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:54,513
Sir, we'd like you to help us out
by taking us down...

697
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,185
- What's the matter?
- Wait just a minute.

698
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:03,731
I can't see!
Something's happened to my eyes.

699
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,399
I can't see!

700
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:07,151
You can't see? He can't see.

701
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:11,197
- Must be an eye cold.
- George, I can't see.

702
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:14,700
- One minute, Mr. Fitzgerald.
- I can't see! George!

703
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,035
George!

704
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:19,914
Mr. Fitzgerald!

705
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:24,335
We want to make sure
he doesn't get loose.

706
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,839
I'll kill that dirty rotten bum...

707
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:31,842
...if I get my hands on him.
What's the matter?

708
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:33,886
How come I'm tied up like this?

709
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:36,389
Just sit there.
Everything will be all right.

710
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:39,058
Yeah. Friends are coming
to take care of you.

711
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,352
What friends?
What are you talking about?

712
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,396
Get this stuff off me. Turn me loose.

713
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:45,398
Take it easy. You've been sick.

714
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:49,276
Who's been sick?
And where's that bum with the glasses?

715
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:52,822
Now just sit still,
because the doctor is going...

716
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,826
What doctor? I don't know no doctor.
What are you guys, crazy or something?

717
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:59,662
I'm warning you.
Get this stuff off me, you understand?

718
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,832
- Get this stuff off me!
- Watch him, Ray, watch him!

719
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,836
I'm warning you!
I'm going to have to hit you again.

720
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,963
Ow!

721
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:11,424
My arm! You broke my arm!

722
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:30,609
You keep this up
and I'm going to get sore.

723
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:40,453
Okay. That's the way you want it,
that's the way you're going to get it.

724
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:48,002
- I'll kill you!
- Whoo!

725
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:54,800
- Help! He's ruining our place!
- Come on, Ray!

726
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:08,397
- You better get out of here, mister!
- Leave us alone!

727
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:16,989
- Uh-huh. There you are.
- What are we going to do?

728
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:22,328
Dr. Zillman! Dr. Zillman!

729
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:38,719
Help! Put me down!
Put me down immediately!

730
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:46,352
- That's the way you want it?
- Help! Help!

731
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:55,986
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

732
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:04,537
You're getting out of line. I'm not
kidding. I've had all I can take.

733
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:07,373
Irwin, we'll have to kill him.

734
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:08,874
- Ready?
- Ready.

735
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:10,209
- Set?
- Set.

736
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:11,335
Charge!

737
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,970
He's going nuts! He's really nuts!

738
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:25,015
- Go away!
- You'd better get out of here!

739
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,893
I mean it, I don't want to...

740
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,524
What'll we do?

741
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:36,944
Go away!

742
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,958
â™ª Got a baby who can give me 31 flavors

743
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:34,627
â™ª And we like tutti-frutti best

744
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:39,340
â™ª I call him ice cream Joe
He is the most delicious boy I know

745
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:42,635
Go, baby, go!

746
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:44,887
â™ª He gives me 31 flavors

747
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,513
- â™ª And we like tutti-frutti best
- Yeah, yeah!

748
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:50,476
- â™ª I just love him so
- Yeah, yeah!

749
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:54,188
Ah, yeah!

750
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:56,815
â™ª Thirty-one flavors

751
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:59,401
- â™ª And we like tutti-frutti best
- Oh!

752
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:04,114
â™ª Bananas, I'm gonna eat

753
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:08,452
Don't stop! Go!

754
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:11,789
Whoo!

755
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:16,460
He's got to be home.

756
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:19,797
He never gets up this early.
Why doesn't he answer?

757
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:26,679
I hope you won't mind my asking,
but what sort of chap...

758
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:28,514
...is this brother-in-law of yours?

759
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:30,349
He's a nut. Why?

760
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:33,560
I hope he's nothing like
my brother-in-law. Peculiar chap.

761
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:35,688
Secretary of a golf club
out near Pangbourne.

762
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:37,064
So what about him?

763
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:40,693
I was thinking that if Reggie,
my brother-in-law...

764
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:44,196
If Reggie got hold of information
like this information...

765
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:46,740
...it's likely that would be
the last time...

766
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:50,536
...anyone would ever see or hear
of dear old Reggie.

767
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:56,208
I doubt very much whether old Reggie
will be waiting for us in Santa Rosita.

768
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,836
Cheers.

769
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:06,385
Tyler! Tyler's probably
still in the shower.

770
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:10,306
Tyler! There he is! Tyler!

771
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,725
- Tyler!
- You promised!

772
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:15,728
Hey! I'll wake him up. Tyler!

773
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:18,522
- Tyler!
- Huh? Huh?!

774
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:22,651
Wake up! Come on now!

775
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,070
- Get out of here!
- Wait!

776
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:26,697
Ah!

777
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:28,240
Mr. Fitzgerald!

778
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,749
You think I'll sit still
while some un-American foreigner...

779
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:39,710
...makes accusations about
my own flesh and blood?

780
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:42,004
We'll see about that. Stop this car!

781
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:45,841
- Really, madam.
- Mother, this is awful!

782
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:48,427
- So we'll see!
- Mother, what are you doing?

783
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:51,430
You don't trust your brother-in-law?
Let me tell you something.

784
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:54,266
If my boy is out, then everybody is out.
So we'll see.

785
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:57,436
We don't even own the car
and you have no right to do what you do.

786
00:55:57,604 --> 00:56:02,566
Rights? You talk to me about rights?

787
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:03,776
Mother...

788
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:06,653
You address me on the subject of rights?

789
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:12,117
Trouble? Having any trouble?

790
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:15,579
Yes! And we don't need
any help from you.

791
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:23,212
Well!

792
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,838
- Mother, please.
- Ah!

793
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:26,590
With all due respect, this is too much.

794
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:29,176
Give Mr. Hawthorne the keys
or we'll never get there.

795
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:30,260
Too bad.

796
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:34,390
Madam, I must say I find your attitude
somewhat less than helpful.

797
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:38,268
And what's all this got to do with you,
if you don't mind telling me?

798
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:41,980
If we have quite decided
to withdraw from this affair...

799
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:46,819
...you might be expected to hand me back
my keys so that I could press on.

800
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:51,198
You keep out of this!
Are we calling Sylvester or not?

801
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:53,909
No!

802
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:58,163
We are not. And I'll tell you why.
Because your son, Sylvester...

803
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:02,501
...is an irresponsible, unreliable,
big loudmouth, no-good bum...

804
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:04,837
...who, if he isn't a crook,
it's only because...

805
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:07,965
...he hasn't got the brains or ambition
even to become a crook.

806
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,133
Good show!

807
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:12,845
If you want to come, you can.
If you don't want to, you don't have to.

808
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:16,807
But you've got to give us those keys or
you'll force us to take them from you!

809
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,308
Here, here.

810
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:28,152
Give us those keys.
Give us those keys.

811
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,320
I don't care where you have them.
I'll get them.

812
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:32,865
- How dare you.
- Give us those keys.

813
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:36,243
- You take one more step towards me...
- I'll take another step.

814
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:39,705
I'm warning you.
You're gonna be sorry!

815
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:42,708
- Give me the keys.
- You're gonna get it, but good!

816
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,793
- Ah!
- Oof!

817
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:48,046
- Emmeline!
- Emmeline, stay in the car!

818
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:50,591
Grab her!

819
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:55,929
Russell, don't! Mother!

820
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:59,057
- Put me down!
- Must be stuck.

821
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:02,478
Russell, you wouldn't.
You couldn't! You shouldn't!

822
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:05,230
Let me go! Let me get out of here!

823
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:08,650
I got 'em! Here they are.

824
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:13,322
We really didn't want to do it.
But that was the only way. Upsy-daisy.

825
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:17,075
Don't hit him. Ow!

826
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,581
Madam, please! Please!

827
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,458
You forced us. You forced us.

828
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:26,877
I'm willing to say I'm sorry,
but you forced us.

829
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:30,881
- Do us a favor and get back in the car.
- Get away from me! Don't you touch me!

830
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:33,926
- We had to do it. You saw it, honey.
- Russell, let me go.

831
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:36,512
Just wait.
You can't manhandle a decent woman.

832
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:39,181
You're going to jail!
You'll be arrested for assault.

833
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:43,101
I'm going to sue for everything you've
got. Take your hands off my daughter!

834
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:45,687
I say, if we are going,
we really must get cracking.

835
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,022
Russell, how could you?

836
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,899
- You know we had to...
- Mr. Finch!

837
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:53,111
Please don't go. We'll be right
with you. See, she made us do it.

838
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:55,405
Let's forget the whole thing
and be reasonable.

839
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:58,492
- Please get back in the car.
- Not me!

840
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:01,578
We are wasting so much time.
Give me the keys.

841
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:20,389
The cars are going faster than we are.

842
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,599
Can't you make this thing
go a little faster?

843
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:26,812
Wide open, I can.
But wide open eats up a lot of gas.

844
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,648
Then open up wide. I'll pay for the gas.

845
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:33,402
- It'll cost you about $50.
- Okay, I'll pay when we land.

846
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,696
- Now!
- I got to pay now?

847
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:38,907
- Now!
- All right, I'll pay you now.

848
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:40,409
- Melville...
- What?

849
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,536
A bug! Get him off!

850
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:46,331
Get him off! There he is! Get him!

851
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:49,543
- You're breaking up the airplane!
- Is it down there?

852
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:53,297
Now you're breaking the floor!

853
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:55,173
- Help!
- Melville!

854
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:58,594
None of these 10 people
have any record at all.

855
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:01,513
And we're ready to book 'em
for withholding information...

856
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:04,516
...causing accidents,
failing to report accidents...

857
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:08,437
...reckless driving, theft, at least
three cases of assault and battery...

858
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,480
- Capt. Culpeper?
- Yeah.

859
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:12,566
- That my home?
- Yes, sir.

860
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:15,652
Uh, Sheriff, excuse me. Another call.

861
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:19,114
Take the Sheriff. I'll take it in here.

862
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:21,825
Freddy, transfer Mrs. Culpeper
to Culpeper's office.

863
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:28,415
- Hello, Ginger?
- Daddy, it's Billie Sue.

864
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:31,543
Oh. Let me speak with
your mother, sweetheart.

865
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:35,922
Well?

866
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,300
Ah, dear.

867
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:42,012
Tell me something, Ginger.
How does it feel being married...

868
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:45,932
...to the most brilliant personality
in the law enforcement industry?

869
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,477
Are you referring to yourself?

870
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:52,814
Ginger, I want you to prepare yourself
for a little shock.

871
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,067
When I tell you what has happened...

872
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:58,070
So tell me.
I've got this biscuit dough...

873
01:00:58,237 --> 01:01:01,657
The Smiler Grogan case is solved.

874
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,408
The what?

875
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:07,829
What the hell is the Smiler Grogan case?

876
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:12,793
The tuna factory robbery.

877
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,588
The case I've been talking about
for the last 15 years.

878
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:21,218
All I want you to do
is make all the preparations...

879
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:24,346
...for a little flight to Hawaii,
Sunday morning.

880
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:27,265
- So what's the gag?
- It is no gag.

881
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:30,769
Are you serious
about flying to Hawaii?

882
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:35,065
Flight 7, Sunday morning.

883
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:37,776
- Are we taking Billie Sue?
- No!

884
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:41,029
Just the two of us
for about three weeks.

885
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:43,407
Now, we're going to celebrate, Ginger.

886
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:47,077
My feeling is that after 27 years...

887
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:50,080
...we've earned it.

888
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:07,723
What's the matter?

889
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:10,058
- I need help. Can you give me a lift?
- What?

890
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:13,103
My wife is sick.
The doc sent me out for some medicine.

891
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:14,187
All right. Come on.

892
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:16,314
- I just ran out of gas.
- Get in!

893
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:32,789
- You?
- You?

894
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:34,499
Wait a minute. We're in trouble.

895
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:37,002
Everybody's in trouble.
Get out of the way.

896
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,504
You think we wanted
to leave you back there?

897
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:41,006
It was my son-in-law
and that Englishman.

898
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:43,508
What Englishman? Get out of the way.

899
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:47,387
You leave us here,
and you know what you're going to get?

900
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:49,639
Nothing! We'll get it all.

901
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:50,766
How will you do that?

902
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:53,810
I'll call my son. He lives
about 10 miles from Rosita Beach.

903
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:58,190
He'll drive there and get the money
and we're going to have it. That's how!

904
01:02:58,357 --> 01:03:01,651
I was going to offer you a share
for taking us to a phone.

905
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:05,447
But because you're not interested,
we'll wait for another car.

906
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:07,240
We're making a terrible mistake.

907
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:09,284
We should go back
and get my mother-in-law.

908
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:10,744
- Go back?
- Yes.

909
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:12,078
You couldn't be serious.

910
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:16,124
All she has to do is get to a telephone,
my brother-in-law will get there first.

911
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:20,378
They'll get all and we won't get a dime.
You can believe that.

912
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:25,217
But look here.

913
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:28,595
Even if she does get all the money,
this won't make any difference...

914
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:31,765
...to our agreement.
She wouldn't break her word.

915
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:36,645
I mean to say, I'd still be entitled
to 10 percent as agreed. Surely.

916
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:40,357
Surely. Come on, let's go.

917
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:06,508
- Operator.
- Santa Rosita 7-1-9-6-5.

918
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:10,595
...and then that dirty, rotten,
slimy bum that double-crossed me.

919
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:13,849
When I get a hold of that smart aleck,
what I'm going to do...

920
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:16,768
If you're there, I hope you turn away...

921
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:19,604
...that's all,
that you just look the other way.

922
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:24,109
Did you get him?

923
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:26,611
Maybe he went out
for the papers or something.

924
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:28,738
We can keep on trying.

925
01:04:28,906 --> 01:04:33,243
Just supposing we never do get him?
We might be the last ones there.

926
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:50,135
Just a minute. Down there?

927
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:51,887
You're kidding. It's too steep.

928
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:54,723
I drive my jeep down here every day.
Let's go!

929
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,182
Yeah, let's go. Let's...

930
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:17,579
You can turn around here.
I sure appreciate this, mister. Thanks.

931
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,998
Yeah, swell, yeah.

932
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:24,753
Hi, Eddie.

933
01:06:19,266 --> 01:06:20,684
I got to get out of here.

934
01:06:20,851 --> 01:06:24,229
Will you ask your father to show me?
There must be some other way out!

935
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:26,314
Come on! Hurry up!

936
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:35,657
I could show you a way out.
There's another way to the road.

937
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:39,953
You know another way to the road?
Good. Come on in. Don't stand there.

938
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:43,289
If you show me the way out,
I'll give you $1.

939
01:06:43,457 --> 01:06:45,583
- Hm... $3.
- $3? Why, you...

940
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:47,669
Yeah, all right. I'll give you $3.

941
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:52,382
But don't stand there, hop in the car.
Hurry kid, I got to get out of here!

942
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:08,273
- They're not here.
- Probably got a lift.

943
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:11,192
We only passed six or seven cars
and they weren't in them.

944
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,236
Somebody must have
taken them the other way.

945
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:15,905
I think we better go back
to that place we phoned from.

946
01:07:16,073 --> 01:07:18,116
What? That's miles
in the wrong direction.

947
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:20,285
Besides, we can't be certain
they'll be there.

948
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:23,538
I don't know, I must find my wife.
And I don't know what to do.

949
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:25,123
Wherever they are...

950
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:28,626
...surely the most sensible thing
is for the two of us to press on.

951
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:31,921
For all we know, your brother-in-law
may be out or away somewhere.

952
01:07:32,089 --> 01:07:35,884
Even if he were the first there,
he still has to find the money.

953
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:38,887
I earnestly recommend
we forget your good ladies...

954
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:40,930
...and press on
with all possible dispatch.

955
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:43,808
All right. We'll press on
with all possible dispatch.

956
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:46,644
And I don't really think
that personal rancor...

957
01:07:46,812 --> 01:07:50,231
...is going to help the situation,
if I may say so.

958
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:09,876
Okay, come on, honey.
Let's go. We're here.

959
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:14,506
We got here first. Let's go.
Come on. I got you.

960
01:08:14,673 --> 01:08:15,840
Atta boy, baby.

961
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:18,009
We made it. We're here first.

962
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:20,303
Take care of my car
until we get back, right?

963
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:24,599
Come on, let's go.
Will you go? Come on!

964
01:08:31,023 --> 01:08:32,440
Over there?

965
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,359
There?

966
01:08:35,152 --> 01:08:36,694
Down there?

967
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:11,104
That'll be $2.90.

968
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:15,233
$2.90? Here's $3.00.
Keep the change, but wait for us, okay?

969
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:16,734
Oh, sure.

970
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:19,737
Wise guy. Come on, let's go.

971
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:23,366
- No, we're closed. It's 12:00.
- It's 12:00. They're closed.

972
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:27,787
Wait a minute!
All we want is a pick and a shovel!

973
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:29,414
Mr. Dinkler's inside.

974
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:32,500
Dinkler. That's it.
We'll get Dinkler. Come on.

975
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:35,420
Ah!

976
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:37,046
Downstairs. Come on.

977
01:09:37,214 --> 01:09:39,883
They must be here someplace.
Down here, yeah.

978
01:09:42,094 --> 01:09:43,970
Look for a pick and a shovel, all right?

979
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:46,973
Pick and a shovel,
must be someplace around.

980
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:48,766
That's all I need.

981
01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:52,478
That's all I need, boy.
That's all I need, a pick and a shovel.

982
01:09:52,646 --> 01:09:53,730
I found it!

983
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:02,405
Got it!

984
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:04,407
- But there...
- I got it! I found it!

985
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:12,207
I've no wish to quarrel with you,
but speaking as a representative...

986
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:15,752
...of Her Majesty's Armed Forces,
I take the most particular exception...

987
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,630
You want me to tell you something?
As far as I'm concerned...

988
01:10:18,797 --> 01:10:20,965
...the whole British race
is practically finished.

989
01:10:21,133 --> 01:10:24,010
If we hadn't kept
your whole country afloat...

990
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:27,138
...by giving you billions
you never even said thank you for...

991
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:31,226
...the whole phony outfit would be
sunk under the Atlantic years ago.

992
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:32,810
Hey.

993
01:10:32,978 --> 01:10:35,813
- What are you stopping for?
- Get out of this machine.

994
01:10:35,981 --> 01:10:37,565
Get out? You're crazy!

995
01:10:37,733 --> 01:10:40,151
It's my machine.
I'll do as I bloody well please. Out!

996
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:43,613
I'm awfully sorry.
I've been very edgy today.

997
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:46,991
If I said anything about England,
I apologize.

998
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:49,035
I'm glad to hear you say so.

999
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:51,079
I must say, if I had the misfortune

1000
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,331
to be a citizen
of this benighted country...

1001
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:57,502
...I should be most hesitant
in offering any criticism of any other.

1002
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:59,545
Wait a minute.
Are you knocking this country?

1003
01:10:59,713 --> 01:11:01,839
Are you saying something
against America?

1004
01:11:02,007 --> 01:11:02,924
Against it?

1005
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:06,427
I'd be astounded to hear
anything said for it.

1006
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:09,389
The whole bloody place
is the most unspeakable matriarchy...

1007
01:11:09,556 --> 01:11:11,015
...in the history of civilization.

1008
01:11:11,183 --> 01:11:15,019
Look at yourself, the way your wife
and her strumpet of a mother...

1009
01:11:15,187 --> 01:11:16,604
...push you through the hoop.

1010
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:19,691
As far as I can see, American men
have been totally emasculated.

1011
01:11:19,858 --> 01:11:20,942
They're like slaves.

1012
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:23,319
They die like flies
from coronary thrombosis...

1013
01:11:23,487 --> 01:11:26,447
...while their women sit under
hair dryers eating chocolates...

1014
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:30,827
...and arranging for every second
Tuesday to be some sort of Mother's Day.

1015
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:34,831
And this positively infantile
preoccupation with bosoms.

1016
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:37,000
In all my time
in this wretched country...

1017
01:11:37,167 --> 01:11:41,546
...the one thing that has appalled me
most is this preoccupation with bosoms.

1018
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:44,924
They've become the dominant theme
in American culture:

1019
01:11:45,092 --> 01:11:48,219
In literature, in advertising,
in entertainment, in everything.

1020
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:50,138
I'll wager you anything you like...

1021
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:52,724
...if American women
stopped wearing brassieres...

1022
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:56,477
...your whole national economy
would collapse overnight.

1023
01:11:57,855 --> 01:11:59,814
F-7 to Central.
The Crumps are locked...

1024
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:02,900
...in the hardware store basement.
Shall I let them out? Over.

1025
01:12:03,068 --> 01:12:05,653
How could they get locked in a basement?

1026
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:08,823
- We better let them out.
- That ain't fair.

1027
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:12,618
- It ain't fair? What ain't fair?
- They got themselves in there.

1028
01:12:12,786 --> 01:12:14,579
They ought to be able
to get themselves out.

1029
01:12:14,747 --> 01:12:19,292
Uh, after all, if you help them,
you're not being fair to the others.

1030
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:22,253
But the moment anybody
gets to where they're going...

1031
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:23,421
...we'll pick them up.

1032
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:25,757
What difference does it make
who gets there first?

1033
01:12:25,924 --> 01:12:27,216
It's a race, ain't it?

1034
01:12:27,384 --> 01:12:28,968
Why do you want to help that dentist?

1035
01:12:29,136 --> 01:12:33,348
Me? I've been pulling for that guy Pike
with the furniture van.

1036
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:35,433
The rules should be the same
for everybody.

1037
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:37,435
Otherwise, it just ain't fair.

1038
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:47,528
Central to F-7.

1039
01:12:48,405 --> 01:12:51,783
No. We'll leave them where they are.
See what happens.

1040
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:55,453
Watch all the exits,
but render no assistance. Over.

1041
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:00,708
Are you happy?

1042
01:13:24,024 --> 01:13:25,233
I need a drink.

1043
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:28,736
There's some ice and stuff back there.
Make us all some Old Fashioneds.

1044
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:31,072
You think you ought to drink
while you're flying?

1045
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,241
Stop kidding and make us some drinks.

1046
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:36,494
Just press the button back there
marked "booze. "

1047
01:13:37,621 --> 01:13:40,289
It's the only way to fly.

1048
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:57,974
Estimated speed 175.

1049
01:13:58,142 --> 01:14:00,184
We'll never be able to keep up with him.

1050
01:14:00,352 --> 01:14:03,604
Better have some of the other units
intercept. Over.

1051
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:07,316
Hello, Ginger?
What's the matter now?

1052
01:14:07,484 --> 01:14:10,736
It's Billie Sue.
Her new boyfriend Oscar...

1053
01:14:10,904 --> 01:14:14,240
...was supposed to come down
from Pomona just to meet us.

1054
01:14:14,408 --> 01:14:17,076
So now she told him
we were going away.

1055
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:18,661
What? What's the matter?

1056
01:14:18,829 --> 01:14:22,415
You keep forgetting.
If a girl is 6 feet 5 inches tall...

1057
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:24,709
...she's bound to have special problems.

1058
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:26,752
- But, Ginger...
- They had some argument...

1059
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:27,837
Get out!

1060
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:30,798
...screaming at each other.
Now the whole engagement's off...

1061
01:14:30,966 --> 01:14:32,758
...and she says she's leaving.

1062
01:14:32,926 --> 01:14:35,344
Leaving what? Leaving home?

1063
01:14:35,512 --> 01:14:37,513
Let me talk to her.
Get her to the phone.

1064
01:14:37,681 --> 01:14:40,266
I'll try. Just a minute.
Talk to your father.

1065
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:43,186
I won't.
I don't want to talk to him ever.

1066
01:14:43,353 --> 01:14:47,231
Don't be ridiculous.
Whatever else he is, he is your father.

1067
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:14,008
Ah!

1068
01:15:15,135 --> 01:15:16,427
Ah!

1069
01:15:39,451 --> 01:15:43,120
Ooh! Yeah! Ah!

1070
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:48,709
Oh!

1071
01:15:51,463 --> 01:15:53,506
You hear bells, baby?

1072
01:15:58,178 --> 01:15:59,095
Yes?

1073
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:02,265
- Who is that?
- Who's that?

1074
01:16:02,432 --> 01:16:04,058
I want my son! Hey!

1075
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:10,314
Who is that?
I want to speak to Sylvester Marcus.

1076
01:16:10,482 --> 01:16:13,401
- Sylvester?
- Yeah, baby?

1077
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:16,529
It's your mom.

1078
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:21,158
Ah! Good old Mom. Hello!

1079
01:16:21,326 --> 01:16:23,786
- Sylvester?
- Is that you, Mom?

1080
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:26,581
Of course it's me.
I've been trying you all morning.

1081
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:29,333
I've been a little busy.

1082
01:16:29,501 --> 01:16:32,169
I've been working
and I didn't hear the phone.

1083
01:16:32,337 --> 01:16:34,297
Hold on a minute, will you, Mom?

1084
01:16:34,464 --> 01:16:38,092
Baby, how about a beer or something?
Man, I feel like...

1085
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:40,469
Will you listen?
Something's happened.

1086
01:16:40,637 --> 01:16:43,931
There was an accident this
morning. A man got killed!

1087
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:45,182
Who got killed?

1088
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:47,018
- Now, listen!
- You all right?

1089
01:16:47,185 --> 01:16:48,644
- Pay attention!
- Sis all right?

1090
01:16:48,812 --> 01:16:50,438
- Will you listen?
- What's wrong?

1091
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:52,023
Can you hear me?

1092
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:53,941
There's a whole fortune in cash.

1093
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:57,445
You can get it before anybody else,
but you've got to hurry!

1094
01:16:57,613 --> 01:17:00,698
What's the matter? What's going on
there? Are you all right?

1095
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:03,534
Of course I'm all right. Sylvester!

1096
01:17:03,702 --> 01:17:04,952
Are Russell and Emmeline with you?

1097
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:09,123
Forget about Russell.
Will you shut up and let me talk?

1098
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:11,667
What's going on? Where's Russell?

1099
01:17:11,835 --> 01:17:13,836
Don't even mention Russell!

1100
01:17:14,004 --> 01:17:17,340
- When I tell you what Russell did...
- Just tell him about the dough.

1101
01:17:17,507 --> 01:17:18,841
Keep out of this! Shut up!

1102
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:21,552
- Don't talk. Just listen.
- What did Russell do?

1103
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:25,348
He assaulted me, if you wanna know!
He grabbed me beside the road.

1104
01:17:25,515 --> 01:17:27,892
He and this Englishman
I don't even know!

1105
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,394
Who's with you and where are you?

1106
01:17:30,562 --> 01:17:34,523
I'm with this truck driver
in Peterson's Garage in Plaster City.

1107
01:17:34,691 --> 01:17:37,026
Will you shut up a minute
so I can tell you what happened?

1108
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:41,697
Listen to me close! Stay there,
'cause I'm coming to get you right now.

1109
01:17:41,865 --> 01:17:42,823
Shut up and listen!

1110
01:17:42,991 --> 01:17:46,702
Everything's going to be all right.
Your baby's coming to get you.

1111
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:49,080
- Sit there. Relax. Take it easy.
- Sylvester!

1112
01:17:49,247 --> 01:17:52,166
I'm coming.
Everything's going to be all right.

1113
01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:57,421
Well?

1114
01:17:58,256 --> 01:18:02,468
So he's coming here,
and I'm not to worry about a thing.

1115
01:18:02,636 --> 01:18:05,680
Because everything
is going to be all right.

1116
01:18:06,431 --> 01:18:10,559
Exactly like your father:
A big, stupid, muscle-headed moron!

1117
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:13,521
The burglar alarm.

1118
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:17,525
We just throw it on, people hear it,
they come, and we're out.

1119
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:20,069
Don't be frightened
if it makes a big bell noise.

1120
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:22,446
Okay? All right? Here we go.

1121
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:30,788
- I don't hear anything.
- Neither do I. There's no bell.

1122
01:18:35,085 --> 01:18:37,503
Look at it. It just stands there.

1123
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:39,964
Wait a minute.

1124
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:43,676
Stand back.

1125
01:18:58,316 --> 01:19:00,860
Burglar alarm!

1126
01:19:01,027 --> 01:19:03,154
The stupidest burglar in the world
could come in...

1127
01:19:03,321 --> 01:19:06,073
...and walk away with everything,
and we can't even get out.

1128
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:08,993
Sheesh!

1129
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:10,995
Come here!

1130
01:19:18,795 --> 01:19:21,672
Melville? Melville!

1131
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:25,676
Even if you do get the bell to ring
and somebody comes...

1132
01:19:25,844 --> 01:19:27,762
...what about the damage?

1133
01:19:29,556 --> 01:19:32,183
They're the ones who locked us in!

1134
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:36,353
This thing has got to work.

1135
01:19:42,027 --> 01:19:43,027
No!

1136
01:19:43,987 --> 01:19:47,865
Please, help me! I'm frying!
Ah! Please! Help me!

1137
01:20:01,087 --> 01:20:03,547
Uh... Don't make them
so sweet this time.

1138
01:20:03,715 --> 01:20:06,759
You've had two already.
Can't you wait till we're on the ground?

1139
01:20:06,927 --> 01:20:09,512
What are you talking about?
I'll make the next batch.

1140
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:11,055
You take the controls.

1141
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:14,809
- I don't know how to fly an airplane.
- There's really nothing to it.

1142
01:20:14,976 --> 01:20:19,271
- But Benjy can't fly!
- Nonsense. Anybody can fly a plane.

1143
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:22,733
I'll check you out.
Put your little hands on the wheel.

1144
01:20:22,901 --> 01:20:25,611
That's it. Now you have it.
Now the feet on the rudder.

1145
01:20:25,779 --> 01:20:27,696
There you are, feet on the rudder.

1146
01:20:27,864 --> 01:20:31,075
Who says this boy can't fly a plane?
There you go.

1147
01:20:31,243 --> 01:20:33,702
I'm making an Old Fashioned
the old-fashioned way...

1148
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:35,913
...the way dear old Dad used to.

1149
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:37,623
What if something happens?

1150
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:40,876
What can happen
to an Old Fashioned, all right?

1151
01:20:43,046 --> 01:20:46,298
I know you don't know what to do,
so don't do nothing.

1152
01:20:46,466 --> 01:20:50,594
- I won't do nothing.
- That boy's a natural-born flyer.

1153
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:04,608
Wait a minute. Benjy! Benjy!
Ease back on her!

1154
01:21:04,776 --> 01:21:06,569
- I'm easing.
- Ease back a little!

1155
01:21:06,736 --> 01:21:10,155
- I'm trying my best.
- All kidding aside...

1156
01:21:10,323 --> 01:21:13,075
I'm not kidding any longer.
It's making me...

1157
01:21:13,243 --> 01:21:16,704
...nervous!
Hey! We've got an accident back here!

1158
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:18,455
- What happened?
- I don't know!

1159
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,088
Oh!

1160
01:21:26,256 --> 01:21:28,841
It's good that truck pulled over.
I can't stand this anymore.

1161
01:21:29,009 --> 01:21:31,051
In the name of reason,
pull yourself together.

1162
01:21:31,219 --> 01:21:32,720
You were 10 feet over the line.

1163
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:12,551
Uh!

1164
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:16,055
Oh! So it's fisticuffs you want, is it?
Right. Stick them up!

1165
01:22:16,222 --> 01:22:18,349
- No! No!
- Come here, you coward!

1166
01:22:18,516 --> 01:22:20,392
No! Don't hit me!

1167
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,436
- Stop, you!
- Don't hit me!

1168
01:22:26,691 --> 01:22:29,902
- Blood.
- It certainly is.

1169
01:22:31,738 --> 01:22:33,822
Come back here, you blimey...

1170
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:41,080
You want to play dirty, huh? Okay!

1171
01:22:44,918 --> 01:22:46,043
Foul! Foul!

1172
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:47,169
You're not much good...

1173
01:22:47,337 --> 01:22:49,630
...without that horrible
mother-in-law of yours, are you?

1174
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:52,216
Ow!

1175
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:55,386
Come on. Fight!

1176
01:22:55,553 --> 01:22:57,805
You thought you had me, didn't you?

1177
01:22:57,973 --> 01:22:59,515
I'll kill you. I swear!

1178
01:22:59,683 --> 01:23:04,228
No, stop, please! No, please.

1179
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:20,119
- Hello. Hello there.
- Don't shut the motor off!

1180
01:23:20,286 --> 01:23:23,622
I'm not shutting anything off!
Hello, anybody! Can anybody hear me?

1181
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:27,543
- I can hear you!
- I don't care if you hear me!

1182
01:23:27,711 --> 01:23:28,585
Look, I wanna be...

1183
01:23:28,753 --> 01:23:31,839
- I don't know whether we're on the air.
- Mayday. Call mayday!

1184
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:36,093
Mayday! Mayday, we're up here!
Can you hear us? Help!

1185
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:40,597
- Benjy, say something.
- Help! Ah!

1186
01:23:41,182 --> 01:23:43,225
Hello? Billie Sue?

1187
01:23:43,393 --> 01:23:46,103
- Billie Sue, where are you?
- I'm at the bus station.

1188
01:23:46,271 --> 01:23:48,772
I only called because
Mommy said I absolutely...

1189
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:52,693
Now, sweetie, what are you doing
in the bus station?

1190
01:23:52,861 --> 01:23:54,862
I'm waiting for the bus.

1191
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:58,032
Your wife's on the other phone.

1192
01:23:58,199 --> 01:24:01,952
Ginger?
I've got Billie Sue on the other line.

1193
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:04,621
Billie Sue, wait one minute, will you?

1194
01:24:05,165 --> 01:24:06,790
- Ginger?
- I'm here.

1195
01:24:06,958 --> 01:24:09,501
Can you hear Billie Sue?
She's crying.

1196
01:24:09,669 --> 01:24:10,627
Billie Sue!

1197
01:24:10,795 --> 01:24:12,671
She's in the bus station
and she's crying,

1198
01:24:12,839 --> 01:24:14,506
but she's waiting for you to tell her.

1199
01:24:14,674 --> 01:24:17,217
- Billie Sue!
- Are you listening?

1200
01:24:17,385 --> 01:24:18,469
Billie?

1201
01:24:18,636 --> 01:24:21,722
- Are you listening to your mother?
- Your mother is speaking.

1202
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:24,808
- Listen to your mother, sweetie.
- Billie Sue!

1203
01:24:24,976 --> 01:24:27,269
Billie Sue! Listen to your mother!

1204
01:24:32,275 --> 01:24:35,277
Everything that's happened
to my daughter and me today...

1205
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:38,405
...only happened for one reason:
Because you were too stupid...

1206
01:24:38,573 --> 01:24:41,366
...to look where you were going,
and wrecked our car!

1207
01:24:41,534 --> 01:24:45,829
Oh, yeah?

1208
01:24:53,379 --> 01:24:56,340
You either get out of that truck
or I'm going to throw you out.

1209
01:24:56,508 --> 01:24:58,050
Don't get upset.

1210
01:24:58,218 --> 01:25:01,637
You're not going to do anything.
Drive on, you big, stupid idiot.

1211
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:07,351
Mommy, don't worry.
Your baby's coming to save you!

1212
01:25:11,189 --> 01:25:14,650
Oh! Mr. Pike! Mr. Pike, please!

1213
01:25:14,818 --> 01:25:18,529
- Let me go! Get away from me!
- That isn't nice a bit!

1214
01:25:18,696 --> 01:25:23,158
Mother!

1215
01:25:23,326 --> 01:25:25,619
Help me!

1216
01:25:33,503 --> 01:25:36,964
That's what I'm here for.
That's why you had me, to save you.

1217
01:25:38,716 --> 01:25:41,135
Help me! Ah!

1218
01:25:41,302 --> 01:25:44,054
Emmeline! Ah!

1219
01:25:44,222 --> 01:25:47,558
Yeah, yeah.

1220
01:25:48,726 --> 01:25:50,185
It's practically burned through.

1221
01:25:50,353 --> 01:25:53,355
Just a couple blows
with the sledgehammer and we're out.

1222
01:25:59,445 --> 01:26:00,779
Ah!

1223
01:26:04,075 --> 01:26:05,159
Eh...

1224
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:20,048
Hey! Wait a minute!

1225
01:26:20,925 --> 01:26:22,467
I can't cross here!

1226
01:26:22,635 --> 01:26:26,471
You said the main road.
This is Niagara Falls.

1227
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:29,183
All right, look. You're a little boy.

1228
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:32,644
If you want to be a big boy,
which way to the main road?

1229
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:42,905
Don't!

1230
01:26:43,072 --> 01:26:45,616
It's no! The answer is no.

1231
01:26:45,783 --> 01:26:49,453
He won't back any increase in pensions.
He won't even talk about it.

1232
01:26:49,621 --> 01:26:53,123
There won't be any increase in pensions.
Do you know why?

1233
01:26:53,291 --> 01:26:55,042
Because they got a solid majority...

1234
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:57,377
...of Republicans and Democrats
who've agreed...

1235
01:26:57,545 --> 01:26:59,671
...that if anything
is said about pensions,

1236
01:26:59,839 --> 01:27:01,798
they'll actually reduce your pension!

1237
01:27:01,966 --> 01:27:04,676
Why? Because they know
that you personally...

1238
01:27:04,844 --> 01:27:08,555
...were more responsible than anybody
else for closing down the houses.

1239
01:27:08,723 --> 01:27:11,141
Could I do anything?
Would he listen to me?

1240
01:27:11,309 --> 01:27:14,728
Ha! All right.
So you're an honest cop...

1241
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:17,397
...and you've spent a lifetime
being an honest cop...

1242
01:27:17,565 --> 01:27:20,359
...and you've got that,
and that's all you've got!

1243
01:27:20,526 --> 01:27:22,694
It's no good saying I'm sorry.

1244
01:27:22,862 --> 01:27:25,989
I'm too angry and sick at my stomach
to be sorry.

1245
01:27:26,157 --> 01:27:27,908
You're not listening
to what I'm saying.

1246
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:30,494
That's the trouble with this family.

1247
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:34,873
- Melville, I smell something burning.
- Ah...

1248
01:27:37,877 --> 01:27:40,170
- Oh!
- Whoa!

1249
01:27:40,338 --> 01:27:43,090
We're on fire! Come over here.

1250
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:46,176
Come on. This way.
Go down. Now. Go.

1251
01:27:46,344 --> 01:27:47,844
Hurry up!

1252
01:27:49,013 --> 01:27:49,972
Put it out!

1253
01:27:50,139 --> 01:27:52,516
I don't know how! Get something!

1254
01:27:52,684 --> 01:27:54,851
- The extinguishers.
- Get one!

1255
01:27:56,020 --> 01:27:58,105
- What'll I do?
- Use it!

1256
01:27:58,273 --> 01:27:59,815
Not on me! On the fire!

1257
01:27:59,983 --> 01:28:01,358
It's too deep!

1258
01:28:01,526 --> 01:28:02,859
This is a car, not a canoe!

1259
01:28:03,027 --> 01:28:05,028
Come on! It's easy!

1260
01:28:05,196 --> 01:28:08,407
If I don't get out of here...
Why? Why?

1261
01:28:11,661 --> 01:28:14,538
All right! Here I come!

1262
01:28:18,543 --> 01:28:19,918
It's too deep!

1263
01:28:20,086 --> 01:28:22,337
It's too deep, you little rat fink!

1264
01:28:22,505 --> 01:28:24,715
Why didn't you tell me it was...
What do I...

1265
01:28:24,882 --> 01:28:27,801
Don't stand there!
Get somebody! Don't...

1266
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:29,845
This is no place for a convertible!

1267
01:28:32,890 --> 01:28:34,224
I'll get you.

1268
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:44,735
I'm bleeding, Emmeline!
Look! I'm bleeding!

1269
01:28:44,902 --> 01:28:47,904
Mama!
What did they do to my Mama?

1270
01:28:50,575 --> 01:28:52,576
Ow! Ooh!

1271
01:29:05,673 --> 01:29:06,798
Benjy!

1272
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,181
It's your father's fault.

1273
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:16,933
- The whole thing is your father's fault.
- Mommy.

1274
01:29:17,101 --> 01:29:18,935
It's your father's fault.

1275
01:29:19,103 --> 01:29:21,938
What's the matter, Chief?
Something wrong?

1276
01:29:22,106 --> 01:29:25,108
- You know as well as I do...
- Listen and stop yelling!

1277
01:29:25,276 --> 01:29:26,735
Stop it, Billie.

1278
01:29:26,903 --> 01:29:28,945
Billie, you're not listening.

1279
01:29:33,409 --> 01:29:36,578
â™ª Well, step into the lobby

1280
01:29:36,746 --> 01:29:40,207
â™ª For whatever is your hobby

1281
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:43,794
â™ª To drink or smoke or repeat some joke

1282
01:29:43,961 --> 01:29:49,216
â™ª It's a mad, mad, mad, mad world â™ª

1283
01:30:10,363 --> 01:30:12,989
Now stop it. Stop it, Monica!

1284
01:30:13,157 --> 01:30:15,826
It's only two pieces of small dynamite.

1285
01:30:15,993 --> 01:30:18,537
And they're 70 feet away
in the other room.

1286
01:30:18,704 --> 01:30:22,582
This is a strong counter.
We can't possibly get hurt from there.

1287
01:30:41,102 --> 01:30:43,770
Please, go and stop it.
Stamp on it or something.

1288
01:30:43,938 --> 01:30:47,107
- You know I hate explosions.
- It's perfectly all right.

1289
01:30:47,275 --> 01:30:51,153
I just want to blow a small hole
in the wall, then we'll be out of here.

1290
01:31:02,832 --> 01:31:05,000
Something's happened to the fuse.

1291
01:31:05,168 --> 01:31:07,627
- What could possibly...
- Hold it. Sh!

1292
01:31:07,795 --> 01:31:09,004
Listen.

1293
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:13,258
The fuse has gone out.
I can't hear it anymore.

1294
01:31:13,426 --> 01:31:17,137
- Stay down. Don't get up.
- I just want to take a look, okay?

1295
01:31:21,017 --> 01:31:23,560
Huh! Now I see.

1296
01:31:25,062 --> 01:31:27,063
It's the fire extinguisher stuff.

1297
01:31:27,231 --> 01:31:29,900
The fire extinguisher stuff got
on the fuse and put it out.

1298
01:31:30,067 --> 01:31:32,319
Melville, don't go in there.
You'll be killed.

1299
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:35,864
- You'll be blown to bits.
- Monica, for heaven's sake.

1300
01:31:36,032 --> 01:31:38,575
I just want to take a look!

1301
01:31:41,078 --> 01:31:44,456
Why do you always imagine
I can't do things for myself?

1302
01:31:44,624 --> 01:31:46,791
Don't you think I got any sense at all?

1303
01:31:47,627 --> 01:31:49,753
Why can't you have
a little confidence in me?

1304
01:32:03,309 --> 01:32:06,102
Sh! Sh! Sh!

1305
01:32:28,084 --> 01:32:30,794
- I'll never be bad again!
- Whoever said you could fly?

1306
01:32:30,962 --> 01:32:33,046
What do ya want from me?
How long I been flying?

1307
01:32:33,214 --> 01:32:35,507
- Keep it going!
- Can't you talk to that radio?

1308
01:32:35,675 --> 01:32:38,218
Hello, anybody on the ground!
On the ground, anybody!

1309
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:39,928
Can you hear us?

1310
01:32:52,316 --> 01:32:54,985
- Stand back!
- Everybody, stand back.

1311
01:32:55,152 --> 01:32:57,779
Stand back, folks. Folks, stand back.

1312
01:33:04,662 --> 01:33:06,997
This is Rancho Conejo Tower.
Do you hear me?

1313
01:33:07,164 --> 01:33:10,417
- We don't know who they are.
- This is Rancho Conejo Tower.

1314
01:33:10,585 --> 01:33:14,170
Aircraft calling Rancho Conejo Tower,
this is Rancho Conejo Tower.

1315
01:33:14,338 --> 01:33:16,172
I got 'em!

1316
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:19,009
I got 'em!
Hello, down there on the ground.

1317
01:33:19,176 --> 01:33:21,428
This is us in the air. We're in trouble!

1318
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:24,764
An awful jam. Listen. Hello?

1319
01:33:24,932 --> 01:33:26,433
I think I lost them.

1320
01:33:26,601 --> 01:33:29,019
Wait a minute.
You're not using the set the right way.

1321
01:33:29,186 --> 01:33:33,023
You press your switch in to transmit.
When it's released, you're on receive.

1322
01:33:33,190 --> 01:33:35,984
Can you understand me?
This is Rancho Conejo Tower.

1323
01:33:36,152 --> 01:33:40,155
- Where are you and who are you? Over.
- I know how to work it, Benjy!

1324
01:33:40,323 --> 01:33:43,074
I know how to work it.
Hello, down on the ground.

1325
01:33:43,242 --> 01:33:44,909
This is us in the air.

1326
01:33:45,077 --> 01:33:47,037
We're in this fella's plane.

1327
01:33:47,204 --> 01:33:48,872
He knocked himself out...

1328
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:52,709
...because he drank a whole case
of bourbon and hit his head.

1329
01:33:52,877 --> 01:33:54,377
What do we do?

1330
01:33:54,545 --> 01:33:57,047
The switch, let go of the switch!

1331
01:33:57,214 --> 01:33:59,382
If you can,
give us your position.

1332
01:33:59,550 --> 01:34:02,052
Who's flying the plane? Over.

1333
01:34:02,219 --> 01:34:05,096
Whaddya mean, "Who's flying the plane?"

1334
01:34:05,264 --> 01:34:07,515
Nobody's flying the plane!

1335
01:34:08,059 --> 01:34:09,726
Sir? Tower here. Emergency.

1336
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:13,063
Tell him it's a full emergency.
We'll try and talk 'em down.

1337
01:34:13,230 --> 01:34:15,732
Full emergency.
We'll try and talk 'em down.

1338
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:18,318
It's a Twin Beech.
I saw one here this morning.

1339
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:21,237
Who's got a Twin Beech?
It's that Col. Wilberforce.

1340
01:34:21,405 --> 01:34:24,616
He was at maintenance.
If he's still there, get him over here.

1341
01:34:24,784 --> 01:34:27,452
Now listen. Don't talk, just listen.

1342
01:34:27,620 --> 01:34:30,413
We're getting things under control,
so you can take it easy.

1343
01:34:30,581 --> 01:34:32,207
We know what kind of a plane you're in.

1344
01:34:32,375 --> 01:34:34,751
We're making necessary preparations
to talk you down.

1345
01:34:34,919 --> 01:34:36,211
Rancho Conejo over.

1346
01:34:36,379 --> 01:34:39,589
Rancho Conejo tower, listen,
we can't land this thing!

1347
01:34:39,757 --> 01:34:41,883
We're in real trouble. Over!

1348
01:34:42,051 --> 01:34:45,428
You'll be perfectly all right
as long as you follow instructions.

1349
01:34:45,596 --> 01:34:48,932
The man at the controls should
also be the man on the radio.

1350
01:34:50,226 --> 01:34:53,269
- Here. Put 'em on.
- No. I don't want to!

1351
01:34:53,437 --> 01:34:54,646
Put 'em on!

1352
01:34:54,814 --> 01:34:57,440
He said the fella flying
should be on this thing.

1353
01:34:57,608 --> 01:35:00,735
Am I supposed to do everything?
You want me to fly, work the radio?

1354
01:35:00,903 --> 01:35:03,154
What are you? The hostess?

1355
01:35:03,989 --> 01:35:06,700
No, he's got to take charge.
What's the matter with him?

1356
01:35:06,867 --> 01:35:08,827
He's just sitting there, rigid-like.

1357
01:35:08,994 --> 01:35:12,372
If he catches you at that keyhole,
you'll be rigid-like.

1358
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:15,625
- He didn't want to be disturbed.
- He keeps looking at the wall.

1359
01:35:15,793 --> 01:35:18,461
He'll have to be disturbed
if any of this develops further.

1360
01:35:18,629 --> 01:35:22,924
I bet you any amount of money that
we could get on the ball and get...

1361
01:35:25,136 --> 01:35:27,470
Everything's under control, Chief.

1362
01:35:27,638 --> 01:35:31,641
- You okay, Chief?
- Yes. Why?

1363
01:35:31,809 --> 01:35:34,185
- How's it going?
- Something's bound to happen soon.

1364
01:35:34,353 --> 01:35:35,603
Take a look at this.

1365
01:35:35,771 --> 01:35:38,148
Those two in the basement
started a fire...

1366
01:35:38,315 --> 01:35:40,984
...then set off fireworks.
They still didn't get out.

1367
01:35:41,152 --> 01:35:43,737
Those two guys in the airplane
had an accident...

1368
01:35:43,904 --> 01:35:45,321
...knocked the pilot unconscious.

1369
01:35:45,489 --> 01:35:47,824
The control tower
is trying to talk them down.

1370
01:35:50,161 --> 01:35:51,494
The others...

1371
01:35:51,662 --> 01:35:54,247
Aerial report that the man,
Otto Meyer, had an accident.

1372
01:35:54,415 --> 01:35:56,916
He tried to cross a river
and he lost his car.

1373
01:35:57,084 --> 01:35:59,836
Now he's on foot,
walking back to the main road.

1374
01:36:01,005 --> 01:36:03,339
This fella Pike, he's here...

1375
01:36:03,507 --> 01:36:07,469
...coming in on 94 with Mrs. Marcus
and her daughter, Mrs. Finch.

1376
01:36:08,763 --> 01:36:12,682
Mr. Finch and this Algernon,
whatever his name is. The limey.

1377
01:36:12,850 --> 01:36:14,684
They're about five
or six miles behind...

1378
01:36:14,852 --> 01:36:17,645
...in an Avis Chevrolet they rented
in Canyon City.

1379
01:36:17,813 --> 01:36:20,523
And this Sylvester Marcus,
the one the old lady called...

1380
01:36:20,691 --> 01:36:23,026
...he's about here going
in the other direction.

1381
01:36:24,820 --> 01:36:28,281
They all ought to be meeting up
in about five minutes.

1382
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:46,007
You know what I believe I'd like?

1383
01:36:48,010 --> 01:36:53,181
A chocolate fudge sundae
with whipped cream and a cherry on top.

1384
01:37:08,405 --> 01:37:12,909
Dingy, don't let this worry you.
We're gonna get killed.

1385
01:37:13,077 --> 01:37:15,203
Men,
this is Col. Wilberforce speaking.

1386
01:37:15,371 --> 01:37:19,082
These gentlemen here have asked me
to take charge of this situation...

1387
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:23,545
...so I immediately said
that I'd be glad to take charge of it.

1388
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:25,588
Before I say anything else...

1389
01:37:25,756 --> 01:37:27,882
I don't think he's going to
help us, Dingy.

1390
01:37:28,050 --> 01:37:30,051
Yes he is, Benjy. He'll help us.

1391
01:37:30,219 --> 01:37:33,429
Now, just have confidence in him.
He's a colonel. Listen to him.

1392
01:37:33,889 --> 01:37:35,306
Steady, men.

1393
01:37:35,474 --> 01:37:38,643
I'm told that neither of you
has had flying experience.

1394
01:37:38,811 --> 01:37:40,603
Before I say anything else...

1395
01:37:40,771 --> 01:37:44,148
...I want to congratulate you
on having done so well...

1396
01:37:44,316 --> 01:37:46,109
...uh, so far.

1397
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:50,321
Now, first of all, men,
I'll explain what we intend to do.

1398
01:37:50,489 --> 01:37:54,117
You can't land the airplane
until you've made your approach.

1399
01:37:54,285 --> 01:37:59,247
And you can't make your approach until
you've made a long slow turnaround...

1400
01:37:59,415 --> 01:38:01,040
...down to the south.

1401
01:38:01,208 --> 01:38:03,835
And we've got to be clear
on a few things

1402
01:38:04,003 --> 01:38:06,796
before you can start
that long slow turn.

1403
01:38:06,964 --> 01:38:11,676
Now, the stick that you're holding,
that is, I assume that...

1404
01:38:11,844 --> 01:38:13,636
Men, are you holding that stick?

1405
01:38:13,804 --> 01:38:15,722
Is somebody holding that stick? Over!

1406
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:19,267
What stick? The wheel.
I'm holding it.

1407
01:38:19,435 --> 01:38:21,519
- We're both holding it.
- Good.

1408
01:38:21,687 --> 01:38:24,981
For a second there, I was afraid...
Never mind that.

1409
01:38:25,149 --> 01:38:28,484
Now I'll explain the controls.
It's important that you understand that.

1410
01:38:28,652 --> 01:38:31,362
Because if you don't,
I'm afraid what might...

1411
01:38:52,343 --> 01:38:54,802
- You want a lift?
- Yes, thank you very much.

1412
01:38:54,970 --> 01:38:57,013
It's nice of you to stop.

1413
01:38:57,181 --> 01:39:00,183
- I'm going as far as Santa Rosita Park.
- That's out of my way.

1414
01:39:00,351 --> 01:39:01,726
- We're blocking traffic.
- We are?

1415
01:39:01,894 --> 01:39:03,019
Let's move it. Move it.

1416
01:39:18,035 --> 01:39:19,619
There we go. All right.

1417
01:39:20,454 --> 01:39:22,872
You hide behind the counter.
I'll light up a fuse.

1418
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:27,251
Melville, will you just do one thing
for me before you use the dynamite?

1419
01:39:27,419 --> 01:39:30,129
Try hitting the door just once more.

1420
01:39:30,297 --> 01:39:34,384
Honey, I broke my back on that door.
That's a hard door. I mean...

1421
01:39:37,888 --> 01:39:39,639
Okay.

1422
01:39:39,807 --> 01:39:41,891
Where's the sledgehammer?

1423
01:39:48,774 --> 01:39:53,277
This staircase isn't safe anymore.
The fire burned it all out.

1424
01:39:53,445 --> 01:39:54,654
Please?

1425
01:39:57,032 --> 01:39:58,366
All right.

1426
01:40:09,461 --> 01:40:11,337
You're going to...

1427
01:40:20,931 --> 01:40:22,515
Melville, for God...

1428
01:40:22,683 --> 01:40:23,933
Melville!

1429
01:40:26,979 --> 01:40:28,354
Monica...

1430
01:40:28,522 --> 01:40:31,482
...now let's forget about the door, huh?

1431
01:40:35,696 --> 01:40:36,654
Look out!

1432
01:40:36,822 --> 01:40:38,823
- What?
- They've spotted us.

1433
01:40:38,991 --> 01:40:41,034
- Who have?
- Don't stop. Keep going.

1434
01:40:41,201 --> 01:40:43,244
- What is this?
- Helicopter. They've seen us.

1435
01:40:43,412 --> 01:40:44,787
What helicopter?

1436
01:40:47,041 --> 01:40:50,460
- That's a police helicopter.
- They always use them.

1437
01:40:50,627 --> 01:40:53,379
- Who?
- Who do you think? Look...

1438
01:40:53,547 --> 01:40:56,299
I don't want to talk about this,
but they got me hemmed in.

1439
01:40:56,467 --> 01:40:58,301
- Who?
- Will you shut up and listen?

1440
01:40:58,469 --> 01:41:02,388
I'm going to break a rule that says
we must never reveal our true identity.

1441
01:41:02,556 --> 01:41:05,308
This is a matter of life or death,
a desperate situation.

1442
01:41:05,476 --> 01:41:07,894
- What is?
- Will you shut up and listen?

1443
01:41:08,062 --> 01:41:10,897
Look, I haven't got much time,
so if you love your country...

1444
01:41:11,065 --> 01:41:13,649
...if you're a patriot, you'll listen,
and listen hard.

1445
01:41:13,817 --> 01:41:15,651
You gotta get to a phone
and make a call.

1446
01:41:15,819 --> 01:41:17,779
- I don't got...
- You got to call Intelligence.

1447
01:41:17,946 --> 01:41:19,947
Central Intelligence Agency
in Washington, D.C.

1448
01:41:20,115 --> 01:41:22,200
- What on earth...
- Now, listen!

1449
01:41:22,367 --> 01:41:25,578
You tell 'em you heard from X-27.
You got it? X-27.

1450
01:41:25,746 --> 01:41:29,207
X-27 told you to tell them they've made
three attempts on my life today.

1451
01:41:29,374 --> 01:41:31,042
They tried to drown me.

1452
01:41:31,210 --> 01:41:33,377
Can you handle a gun? Now, look... Oh!

1453
01:41:33,545 --> 01:41:36,214
There's a cafe. Pull right in there.
You'll use that phone.

1454
01:41:36,381 --> 01:41:38,633
- I don't think I...
- Shut up! You're in no danger.

1455
01:41:38,801 --> 01:41:40,551
They've never seen ya. Now, pull in.

1456
01:41:47,851 --> 01:41:49,685
All right, good. Get to a phone.

1457
01:41:49,853 --> 01:41:53,189
Tell the operator "emergency priority,"
then ask for the CIA.

1458
01:41:53,357 --> 01:41:55,358
Jump out. Come on, come on.

1459
01:41:55,526 --> 01:41:57,401
You're in no danger.
They don't know you.

1460
01:41:57,569 --> 01:42:00,363
You're all right.
I'll duck the car and come back.

1461
01:42:00,531 --> 01:42:02,448
For God's sake,
don't stand in the street.

1462
01:42:02,616 --> 01:42:04,200
They'll see you. They'll spot you!

1463
01:42:04,368 --> 01:42:06,702
Move it. Yah! Go!

1464
01:42:20,217 --> 01:42:23,719
And... Sylvester! It's Sylvester!
Turn around, you idiot!

1465
01:42:23,887 --> 01:42:26,514
What do you want to stop him for?
He's going the wrong way.

1466
01:42:26,682 --> 01:42:29,308
It's my son. Do as you're told, stupid.

1467
01:42:45,993 --> 01:42:46,909
They're nuts.

1468
01:42:47,077 --> 01:42:50,413
Tell them the tow truck turned around
and is following the Dodge.

1469
01:42:51,039 --> 01:42:53,249
2-1-7-1, 2-1-5-9.

1470
01:42:54,585 --> 01:42:56,252
This is stupid.

1471
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:57,920
You call me a stupid idiot.

1472
01:42:58,088 --> 01:43:00,381
Let me tell you something.
You're a stupid idiot.

1473
01:43:00,549 --> 01:43:04,468
- He'll go all the way to Plaster City.
- So he goes to Plaster City.

1474
01:43:04,636 --> 01:43:07,263
I don't know about you,
but I'm turning this thing around.

1475
01:43:07,431 --> 01:43:10,641
Now, you want to catch him,
you get out and run.

1476
01:43:30,913 --> 01:43:32,580
Let's stop arguing. Please.

1477
01:43:32,748 --> 01:43:35,458
The reason we're together
is because they only had one car.

1478
01:43:35,626 --> 01:43:38,461
Let's get there, even if we are last.

1479
01:43:38,629 --> 01:43:42,924
Whatever the outcome of the day,
I shall never forget that you hit me...

1480
01:43:43,091 --> 01:43:45,218
...when I wasn't even looking.

1481
01:43:45,385 --> 01:43:46,385
Yeah.

1482
01:43:55,062 --> 01:43:56,687
Russell!

1483
01:44:09,493 --> 01:44:13,955
- How can you be so slow?
- I've had just about enough out of you.

1484
01:44:14,122 --> 01:44:15,873
If ya turned quicker
we coulda caught him!

1485
01:44:16,041 --> 01:44:19,085
- Why don't you shut up?
- Russell! There!

1486
01:44:19,253 --> 01:44:21,170
It's Russell and Mr. Hawthorne!

1487
01:44:21,338 --> 01:44:22,505
Stop them! Catch them!

1488
01:44:22,673 --> 01:44:24,006
We gonna start that again?

1489
01:44:24,174 --> 01:44:26,717
Faster! Step on it!
Blow the horn, you big dope!

1490
01:44:26,885 --> 01:44:28,552
What do you want them for anyway?

1491
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:30,721
Keep up with them.
You're falling behind.

1492
01:44:30,889 --> 01:44:33,391
Sylvester! Mother! Sylvester!

1493
01:44:33,558 --> 01:44:36,185
Stop him! Don't let him get away!

1494
01:44:41,275 --> 01:44:44,151
I say, what's that chap
honking his hooter for?

1495
01:44:44,319 --> 01:44:47,154
It's probably some road hog
who thinks he owns...

1496
01:44:47,322 --> 01:44:48,614
- What?
- What?

1497
01:44:48,782 --> 01:44:51,701
I got to ask you something about Mama!
Russell, wait a minute!

1498
01:44:51,868 --> 01:44:54,704
- It's my brother-in-law.
- What's he doing?

1499
01:44:54,871 --> 01:44:57,498
Be careful of him. He's not normal.

1500
01:44:58,500 --> 01:45:01,085
You're getting me...
Boy, are you bugging me, man!

1501
01:45:01,253 --> 01:45:05,214
I'm going to nail...
I'm getting bugged now!

1502
01:45:05,382 --> 01:45:06,340
Whoa, man.

1503
01:45:07,718 --> 01:45:10,052
Russell, if you don't pull over,
I'll kill you!

1504
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:12,221
I'm warning you,
pull over and stop.

1505
01:45:12,389 --> 01:45:13,764
I said stop!

1506
01:45:13,932 --> 01:45:15,558
You asked for it.

1507
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:25,151
Russell,
when I get my hands on you...

1508
01:45:26,194 --> 01:45:27,903
What are you doing?

1509
01:45:28,071 --> 01:45:29,572
- I said stop!
- Are you crazy?

1510
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:31,907
- We'll get killed!
- Pull over!

1511
01:45:42,294 --> 01:45:45,755
Don't you know what I mean?
I said stop that car!

1512
01:45:51,136 --> 01:45:54,430
When I get my hands on you, Russell,
I will kill you!

1513
01:46:13,283 --> 01:46:14,950
Are you crazy?

1514
01:46:15,118 --> 01:46:17,161
Ah!

1515
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:26,462
I've never seen anything
like this bunch.

1516
01:46:26,630 --> 01:46:29,298
He ran right into them,
ran them right off the road.

1517
01:46:30,467 --> 01:46:34,136
- You guys, come on out of there!
- Fellow's absolutely beside himself.

1518
01:46:34,304 --> 01:46:36,722
- What are you trying to do?
- Let's go!

1519
01:46:36,890 --> 01:46:39,350
- What did you do to my mother?
- We wouldn't do any...

1520
01:46:40,394 --> 01:46:41,477
Move! Move!

1521
01:46:41,645 --> 01:46:45,147
- What did you do to my mother?
- I didn't do anything! Let me explain.

1522
01:46:45,315 --> 01:46:46,649
Look here.

1523
01:46:47,484 --> 01:46:48,984
She called me. She phoned me.

1524
01:46:49,152 --> 01:46:51,821
What she told me was so horrible,
I thought she'd gone nuts!

1525
01:46:51,988 --> 01:46:53,489
- It was true, wasn't it?
- It's not true.

1526
01:46:53,657 --> 01:46:56,450
Whoever told you was a liar.
It's not true.

1527
01:46:56,618 --> 01:46:59,370
- It is true!
- Now, look here!

1528
01:47:00,914 --> 01:47:03,040
Are you English? Just answer me!

1529
01:47:03,208 --> 01:47:06,502
Yes. As a matter of fact, I am.
Don't you like the English?

1530
01:47:09,965 --> 01:47:11,257
There was an Englishman.

1531
01:47:11,425 --> 01:47:14,468
She said that you and this Englishman...
I'll kill you!

1532
01:47:15,846 --> 01:47:17,513
What did you do to my Mama?

1533
01:47:17,681 --> 01:47:20,641
- Emmeline!
- Mama!

1534
01:47:20,809 --> 01:47:23,602
Why couldn't you listen?
Why couldn't you shut up...

1535
01:47:23,770 --> 01:47:25,354
...when I was trying
to tell you to listen?

1536
01:47:25,522 --> 01:47:28,482
That chap's run absolutely amok!

1537
01:47:29,651 --> 01:47:31,193
Few minutes, we'll have 'em in position.

1538
01:47:31,361 --> 01:47:34,196
In a couple of minutes,
we'll have you in position.

1539
01:47:34,364 --> 01:47:36,740
- You're doing a great job, Colonel.
- Thank you.

1540
01:47:36,908 --> 01:47:39,368
Why not just shoot 'em down?

1541
01:47:39,953 --> 01:47:42,872
None of these people must suspect...

1542
01:47:43,039 --> 01:47:45,875
...that they have ever been
under observation.

1543
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:49,044
Now, none of them have ever seen me.

1544
01:47:49,212 --> 01:47:50,754
None of them know me...

1545
01:47:50,922 --> 01:47:53,632
...so I'll be moving in alone.

1546
01:47:54,885 --> 01:47:57,803
The minute I move in,
I'll give you the word.

1547
01:47:57,971 --> 01:47:59,972
And when you pass the word...

1548
01:48:01,224 --> 01:48:04,685
...I don't want to have another
policeman within miles of me.

1549
01:48:04,853 --> 01:48:06,228
- Right?
- Right.

1550
01:48:08,315 --> 01:48:10,608
I, uh...

1551
01:48:10,775 --> 01:48:14,236
I won't like it
if I see another policeman.

1552
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:16,864
I give you my word.

1553
01:48:17,032 --> 01:48:20,576
I wanted to stop for you.
My wife and he wanted to stop for you.

1554
01:48:20,744 --> 01:48:23,037
Tell him how my mother-in-law
made us drive by him.

1555
01:48:23,205 --> 01:48:25,498
Anything you have to say
about your mother-in-law...

1556
01:48:25,665 --> 01:48:27,082
...you don't have to explain to me.

1557
01:48:27,250 --> 01:48:28,334
You know what I mean?

1558
01:48:28,502 --> 01:48:31,462
If she were a star
of a real crummy horror movie...

1559
01:48:31,630 --> 01:48:34,173
...I'd believe it.

1560
01:48:34,925 --> 01:48:35,841
Yeah!

1561
01:48:36,009 --> 01:48:37,051
That's him!

1562
01:48:37,219 --> 01:48:40,429
If I catch you, I'll kill you!
I tell you, I'll kill you!

1563
01:48:40,597 --> 01:48:42,765
You dirty robber!

1564
01:48:42,933 --> 01:48:44,558
Someone you know?

1565
01:49:00,116 --> 01:49:01,992
I'll drive. All set?

1566
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:03,827
All set, Chief.

1567
01:49:03,995 --> 01:49:05,663
Culpeper, all set?

1568
01:49:05,830 --> 01:49:06,747
Yes, sir.

1569
01:49:06,915 --> 01:49:09,625
Airport just reported
and they're starting an approach now.

1570
01:49:09,793 --> 01:49:10,918
Right.

1571
01:49:18,802 --> 01:49:21,220
What's the matter, Chief?
You forgotten something?

1572
01:49:23,807 --> 01:49:26,392
No. I don't think
I've forgotten a thing.

1573
01:49:37,737 --> 01:49:42,032
Now, men, about the brakes...
You've got to know about the brakes.

1574
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:46,328
I'll tell you
in just a minute. Just hold it a second.

1575
01:49:46,496 --> 01:49:48,747
What the hell is with this wire?

1576
01:49:48,915 --> 01:49:50,958
Just hold it a second.

1577
01:49:51,126 --> 01:49:52,501
What was that?

1578
01:49:52,669 --> 01:49:53,752
Men, look.

1579
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:58,257
Be calm. This is it.
Just one minute more, it'll be all over.

1580
01:49:58,425 --> 01:50:00,968
I mean, it'll all be over.
I mean, courage, men.

1581
01:50:01,136 --> 01:50:04,179
We're all with you every second.

1582
01:50:04,347 --> 01:50:07,016
We're pulling for you
as hard as we can.

1583
01:50:07,183 --> 01:50:09,810
Now it's just hold onto
your nerves, men,

1584
01:50:09,978 --> 01:50:11,895
and not get excited
or do anything foolish.

1585
01:50:12,063 --> 01:50:14,356
But just keep calm.
That's all we'll do.

1586
01:50:14,524 --> 01:50:16,775
Keep calm. Calm, men!

1587
01:50:20,655 --> 01:50:22,364
Not that calm, you idiot!

1588
01:50:27,078 --> 01:50:28,954
Pull up!

1589
01:50:41,926 --> 01:50:44,011
Now, don't worry. Just keep calm.

1590
01:50:45,221 --> 01:50:47,890
What's this?
What's this that's coming?

1591
01:50:48,058 --> 01:50:52,519
- That's good. That's cement.
- What? Wait a minute! Hold it!

1592
01:50:52,687 --> 01:50:54,730
What are you doing, Benjy?

1593
01:51:00,737 --> 01:51:02,738
- What, are you trying to scare me?
- No!

1594
01:51:02,906 --> 01:51:04,406
Well, you did.

1595
01:51:06,868 --> 01:51:10,079
It's just a couple of sticks
of dynamite, that's all.

1596
01:51:10,246 --> 01:51:13,916
How much noise could it make?
Boom. It's all over.

1597
01:51:14,084 --> 01:51:15,918
Get it over right! Get it over!

1598
01:51:16,086 --> 01:51:17,086
Left rudder!

1599
01:51:17,253 --> 01:51:19,213
Too low! Pull up.

1600
01:51:19,381 --> 01:51:20,756
No! Left rudder!

1601
01:51:20,924 --> 01:51:24,051
No! Pull it up!

1602
01:51:24,219 --> 01:51:25,302
Help!

1603
01:51:27,389 --> 01:51:30,933
Help!
I'm the Colonel, you know!

1604
01:51:31,101 --> 01:51:32,101
Help!

1605
01:51:32,268 --> 01:51:34,645
Help! Get me down!

1606
01:51:37,607 --> 01:51:39,775
We're not going to land
and we'll never make it.

1607
01:51:39,943 --> 01:51:43,445
What do you mean, we'll never make it?
Don't freeze.

1608
01:51:43,613 --> 01:51:45,531
Benjy, don't freeze.

1609
01:51:49,661 --> 01:51:51,286
This one's going to work.

1610
01:51:51,454 --> 01:51:53,455
- Damn it, come to!
- You hit me.

1611
01:51:53,623 --> 01:51:56,375
Listen, wait a minute.

1612
01:52:02,841 --> 01:52:04,425
We're down!

1613
01:52:04,592 --> 01:52:06,468
- We're on the ground.
- Hooray!

1614
01:52:06,636 --> 01:52:09,722
It's just a noise, that's all.
It's way over there.

1615
01:52:14,394 --> 01:52:15,352
Put on the brakes.

1616
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:16,895
Okay. Where are they?

1617
01:52:17,063 --> 01:52:19,189
Benjy! Here comes a restaurant!

1618
01:52:26,948 --> 01:52:28,532
We've landed! Come on.

1619
01:52:34,789 --> 01:52:37,374
Come on. Hurry. Now, hurry up.

1620
01:52:37,542 --> 01:52:39,543
- Come on, let's go.
- What about him?

1621
01:52:39,711 --> 01:52:41,754
Never mind him.
An ambulance will come.

1622
01:52:41,921 --> 01:52:43,714
Let's get out of here.

1623
01:52:45,550 --> 01:52:47,551
Cab!

1624
01:52:48,094 --> 01:52:50,763
Cab!

1625
01:52:51,222 --> 01:52:54,141
We're in an awful hurry.
Do you know where the State Park is?

1626
01:52:54,309 --> 01:52:56,226
Sure. What happened?

1627
01:52:56,394 --> 01:52:58,103
Emergency landing. Come on, hurry.

1628
01:52:58,271 --> 01:53:00,022
Quick, let's go. Come on.

1629
01:53:00,190 --> 01:53:01,607
Come on, Benjy.

1630
01:53:14,287 --> 01:53:16,830
Oh! Excuse me.

1631
01:53:21,795 --> 01:53:23,712
Excuse us. Here's your bag.

1632
01:53:25,298 --> 01:53:27,466
You see, the lock didn't work.

1633
01:53:27,634 --> 01:53:28,550
Go.

1634
01:53:28,718 --> 01:53:32,638
That's all.
The owners will pay for everything.

1635
01:53:32,806 --> 01:53:35,140
Next door, he'll pay for everything.
It's okay.

1636
01:53:43,775 --> 01:53:45,275
You people. You!

1637
01:53:45,443 --> 01:53:47,402
Come back here. Come back!

1638
01:53:47,570 --> 01:53:49,363
You vandals!

1639
01:53:49,531 --> 01:53:52,908
The cops in this town
are morons, retarded.

1640
01:53:53,076 --> 01:53:54,910
I'm dealing with moronic people.

1641
01:53:55,078 --> 01:53:57,412
'Cause he's in a bad humor,
that fat Nazi.

1642
01:53:57,580 --> 01:53:59,206
What, I gotta suffer 'cause of him?

1643
01:53:59,374 --> 01:54:01,959
Get away from me.
What's the matter?

1644
01:54:02,126 --> 01:54:06,588
Can't you see I'm on the phone?
Gimme two minutes!

1645
01:54:06,756 --> 01:54:08,382
Now, listen, Sy...

1646
01:54:09,008 --> 01:54:11,426
Will you take us
to Santa Rosita State Park?

1647
01:54:11,594 --> 01:54:14,137
What's the matter?
What happened to you? Initiation?

1648
01:54:14,305 --> 01:54:16,098
We had an accident. Hurry up!

1649
01:54:16,933 --> 01:54:19,560
Benjamin and Bell stopped
at a gardener supply place

1650
01:54:19,727 --> 01:54:21,687
and bought picks and shovels.

1651
01:54:21,855 --> 01:54:24,398
Hold it, Chief.
Here's a report on the Crumps.

1652
01:54:24,566 --> 01:54:28,944
Their cab turned onto 101 moving south
toward your present position.

1653
01:54:29,112 --> 01:54:33,156
Wait. The other taxi's
also turning onto 101...

1654
01:54:33,324 --> 01:54:36,368
...and they're moving north.
They're both coming your way.

1655
01:54:36,536 --> 01:54:37,619
Understood.

1656
01:54:37,787 --> 01:54:39,121
Stand by.

1657
01:54:39,289 --> 01:54:42,249
- They ought to be here any minute.
- Uh-huh.

1658
01:55:05,815 --> 01:55:07,065
Look.

1659
01:55:07,233 --> 01:55:10,944
It's the two idiots, the little one and
the one with the marbles in his mouth.

1660
01:55:11,112 --> 01:55:13,864
- It's that hokey dentist.
- Yeah.

1661
01:55:14,032 --> 01:55:15,240
Pass that cab.

1662
01:55:15,408 --> 01:55:17,075
- What's the rush?
- Whaddaya mean "rush"?

1663
01:55:17,243 --> 01:55:19,620
No rush. We're just in a hurry.

1664
01:55:28,129 --> 01:55:29,671
Culpeper.

1665
01:55:29,839 --> 01:55:31,340
Now.

1666
01:55:31,507 --> 01:55:33,342
Give the order to pull away.

1667
01:55:39,682 --> 01:55:42,059
- Come on. Hurry up.
- Shouldn't I wait around?

1668
01:55:42,226 --> 01:55:43,185
No. Here's $5.

1669
01:55:43,353 --> 01:55:46,980
- What's with the pick and shovel?
- Mind your own business. Come on.

1670
01:55:48,274 --> 01:55:52,319
Hey! Hey!

1671
01:55:53,196 --> 01:55:55,072
- Think anybody is here?
- Didn't see any cars.

1672
01:55:55,239 --> 01:55:56,907
Wait a minute!

1673
01:55:57,450 --> 01:55:59,868
- Let's talk this over.
- I got nothing to talk about.

1674
01:56:00,036 --> 01:56:01,662
Wait a minute.

1675
01:56:01,829 --> 01:56:03,205
Think anybody else has been here?

1676
01:56:03,373 --> 01:56:05,624
- How should I know?
- Wait!

1677
01:56:05,792 --> 01:56:08,543
If you think we're the first ones here,
why not make a deal?

1678
01:56:08,711 --> 01:56:09,670
The four of us?

1679
01:56:09,837 --> 01:56:12,172
Nobody knows where to look,
so we'll look together.

1680
01:56:12,340 --> 01:56:16,885
We'll find it before the others.
Incidentally, where are all the others?

1681
01:56:17,053 --> 01:56:20,722
How come you two just got here?
You had the plane.

1682
01:56:20,890 --> 01:56:24,393
Yeah... What happened to you?

1683
01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:27,229
They're up to something funny,
you hear?

1684
01:56:27,397 --> 01:56:31,233
Did you see the blonde I brought,
covered in paint with her dress ripped?

1685
01:56:31,401 --> 01:56:32,943
What's that all about?

1686
01:56:33,111 --> 01:56:36,738
Yeah. And what about
the picks and shovels?

1687
01:56:45,498 --> 01:56:48,959
You run back to headquarters.
Wait till you hear from me.

1688
01:56:49,127 --> 01:56:50,252
Let me come, Chief.

1689
01:56:50,420 --> 01:56:53,130
I'd like to,
but it might snarl things up.

1690
01:56:54,173 --> 01:56:56,091
Thanks for everything.

1691
01:56:56,259 --> 01:56:58,051
Lots of luck, Chief.

1692
01:57:32,795 --> 01:57:35,756
Benjy! Did you see anything, pal?

1693
01:57:35,923 --> 01:57:38,341
No, but there must be
something somewhere.

1694
01:57:38,509 --> 01:57:41,178
Yeah... Hey! Hey!

1695
01:57:42,513 --> 01:57:44,139
- See anything?
- Not a thing.

1696
01:57:44,307 --> 01:57:47,476
Are you sure he didn't say
something you've forgotten?

1697
01:57:47,643 --> 01:57:51,396
He said it's buried under a big W
and that we'd see it.

1698
01:57:51,564 --> 01:57:53,815
- It's gotta be here.
- I tell you what we do.

1699
01:57:53,983 --> 01:57:56,193
You go how we came.
We'll go how you came.

1700
01:57:56,360 --> 01:57:58,737
We might have missed something.
Hold it.

1701
01:57:59,822 --> 01:58:01,782
You go the way we came...

1702
01:58:01,949 --> 01:58:03,867
That's right. Okay, let's go.

1703
01:58:11,501 --> 01:58:14,002
They're looking for something
buried under a big W.

1704
01:58:14,170 --> 01:58:16,880
I heard one of them,
the stutterer, say it.

1705
01:58:17,048 --> 01:58:19,382
Yeah, I heard. But what?

1706
01:59:07,849 --> 01:59:09,057
Hey!

1707
01:59:09,225 --> 01:59:10,517
Did you see anything?

1708
01:59:10,685 --> 01:59:11,977
- No. Did you?
- Nothing.

1709
01:59:12,145 --> 01:59:14,729
That guy hid it so good,
he couldn't find it himself.

1710
01:59:14,897 --> 01:59:15,897
I think...

1711
01:59:26,075 --> 01:59:27,242
Who's he?

1712
01:59:27,410 --> 01:59:30,078
- I don't know.
- But he had a shovel.

1713
01:59:30,246 --> 01:59:31,705
Maybe he's a prospector.

1714
01:59:31,873 --> 01:59:33,957
- What are you talking...
- We're wasting time.

1715
01:59:34,125 --> 01:59:35,876
Harder. We gotta look harder!

1716
01:59:36,043 --> 01:59:38,336
Let's look harder. Come on, let's go.

1717
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:51,600
Who's he?

1718
01:59:51,767 --> 01:59:53,935
I don't know,
but he hasn't got a shovel.

1719
02:00:02,278 --> 02:00:04,529
- He's here, I tell ya.
- Yes, sir. That's his car.

1720
02:00:04,697 --> 02:00:07,574
- I'll get that phony.
- Somebody must've come in those cabs.

1721
02:00:07,742 --> 02:00:11,203
- Come on, let's get moving!
- Come on, let's get moving!

1722
02:00:11,370 --> 02:00:14,289
- They must be here.
- They'd better be. Come on, Emmeline.

1723
02:00:14,457 --> 02:00:17,083
- Don't just sit there!
- Don't just sit there!

1724
02:00:17,251 --> 02:00:19,044
Yes, I am.

1725
02:00:19,212 --> 02:00:21,296
Then sit!

1726
02:00:21,464 --> 02:00:24,174
Mrs. Finch,
aren't you the teeniest bit curious?

1727
02:00:24,342 --> 02:00:28,386
No. I'm not even curious,
just disgusted.

1728
02:00:28,554 --> 02:00:32,224
I say, that really is a pity.
Do forgive me, I must go.

1729
02:00:39,523 --> 02:00:41,816
Psst!

1730
02:00:41,984 --> 02:00:44,319
You wouldn't know a big W
if you saw one!

1731
02:00:44,487 --> 02:00:45,820
- I know a...
- Shut up!

1732
02:00:45,988 --> 02:00:48,865
I don't care what you say,
I don't think they're here yet.

1733
02:00:49,033 --> 02:00:51,660
They're here somewhere.
That means they haven't found it.

1734
02:00:51,827 --> 02:00:53,995
That's all he said? "Under a big W"?

1735
02:00:54,163 --> 02:00:56,456
Actually, I joined the party after that.

1736
02:00:56,624 --> 02:00:59,000
Yes, sir, that's what he said.
It's under a big W.

1737
02:00:59,168 --> 02:01:02,671
- Let's look...
- Will you shut up and follow me?

1738
02:01:56,976 --> 02:01:58,268
- Who's that?
- I don't know!

1739
02:01:58,436 --> 02:02:00,228
- From this morning?
- Yes.

1740
02:02:02,898 --> 02:02:05,066
- Who's he?
- I don't know.

1741
02:02:06,610 --> 02:02:08,194
- Who's he?
- I don't know!

1742
02:02:08,362 --> 02:02:11,281
Mama, how many people
are mixed up in this?

1743
02:02:12,450 --> 02:02:15,118
Mama, who are they? Cabbies?

1744
02:02:15,286 --> 02:02:17,203
Mama, this thing's like a convention.

1745
02:02:54,408 --> 02:02:57,077
Is anything wrong, ma'am?
I didn't mean to startle you.

1746
02:02:57,244 --> 02:03:00,997
Who are you? Are you with the others,
the ones that are looking?

1747
02:03:01,165 --> 02:03:03,500
- I am, in a way. Aren't you?
- No.

1748
02:03:03,667 --> 02:03:06,753
I mean, I didn't want anything
to do with it right from the start.

1749
02:03:06,921 --> 02:03:08,797
And you know what?

1750
02:03:08,964 --> 02:03:13,468
I know where it is. I'm the only one,
and I wasn't even looking.

1751
02:03:13,636 --> 02:03:14,928
You know where it is?

1752
02:03:15,096 --> 02:03:17,138
Yes! What should I do?

1753
02:03:18,724 --> 02:03:20,683
Ugh!

1754
02:03:20,851 --> 02:03:22,852
Come on out, everyone!
This is ridiculous.

1755
02:03:23,020 --> 02:03:25,355
- I absolutely agree.
- Come on out.

1756
02:03:25,523 --> 02:03:27,982
We all know we're all here.
Nobody's fooling anyone.

1757
02:03:28,150 --> 02:03:29,651
So we all know. So what?

1758
02:03:29,819 --> 02:03:31,986
Don't talk to my mama
in that tone of voice!

1759
02:03:32,154 --> 02:03:33,488
- You hear?
- Shut up!

1760
02:03:33,656 --> 02:03:37,534
Listen, we ain't the only ones here.
I seen four or five others.

1761
02:03:37,701 --> 02:03:39,160
Those two cab drivers.

1762
02:03:39,328 --> 02:03:42,330
- They came with us and that dentist.
- You want to start?

1763
02:03:42,498 --> 02:03:45,667
- Yes, I want to...
- Why are we wasting time?

1764
02:03:45,835 --> 02:03:47,210
We're all here.

1765
02:03:47,378 --> 02:03:50,880
Even if somebody finds the money,
nobody gets away with it...

1766
02:03:51,048 --> 02:03:53,091
...unless everybody gets a share.

1767
02:03:53,259 --> 02:03:56,136
Let's all get sensible
and get this organized.

1768
02:03:56,303 --> 02:03:59,013
Did you all hear what Mama said?

1769
02:03:59,181 --> 02:04:01,724
- Come on, Mama.
- Now, wait a minute.

1770
02:04:01,892 --> 02:04:05,019
Did any of you see a guy with glasses...

1771
02:04:05,187 --> 02:04:07,814
...with a sneery expression on his face?

1772
02:04:07,982 --> 02:04:11,151
This guy was ugly.
I mean, like, real ugly.

1773
02:04:15,197 --> 02:04:19,742
If you help dig it up,
you can have half and I'll have half.

1774
02:04:19,910 --> 02:04:22,537
Is that okay? I mean, is that fair?

1775
02:04:23,289 --> 02:04:25,582
If I have half of the money...

1776
02:04:25,749 --> 02:04:29,043
...I can go away somewhere
where nobody can find me.

1777
02:04:29,211 --> 02:04:34,215
Not Russell or my mother
or Sylvester, anybody.

1778
02:04:35,176 --> 02:04:37,427
You don't know what that'd mean.

1779
02:04:37,595 --> 02:04:38,887
If I had enough money...

1780
02:04:39,054 --> 02:04:42,432
...I might be able to live
in a convent or something.

1781
02:04:42,600 --> 02:04:44,559
- In a convent?
- Uh-huh.

1782
02:04:44,727 --> 02:04:47,395
We all know we're all here.

1783
02:04:47,563 --> 02:04:50,565
It seems intelligent to me
that we should all share...

1784
02:04:50,733 --> 02:04:52,859
...in one equal share apiece, right?

1785
02:04:53,027 --> 02:04:54,068
Right. Mel was right.

1786
02:04:54,236 --> 02:04:56,779
We all know that. Lookit...

1787
02:04:56,947 --> 02:04:59,532
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah. Mm-hm.

1788
02:04:59,700 --> 02:05:01,993
It's him, all right. Yeah!

1789
02:05:02,953 --> 02:05:06,080
You got this wrong.
I came to apologize.

1790
02:05:06,248 --> 02:05:09,375
Forgive and forget! I'm your friend.

1791
02:05:09,543 --> 02:05:11,920
He's so neurotic.
Can't you do something?

1792
02:05:12,087 --> 02:05:12,879
I'll get you.

1793
02:05:13,047 --> 02:05:17,342
- He's very neurotic. I'm your friend!
- When I get my hands on you...

1794
02:05:29,396 --> 02:05:30,480
Why, that's it.

1795
02:05:30,648 --> 02:05:32,607
Sure. Look!

1796
02:05:32,775 --> 02:05:34,859
It's the big W, I tell you!

1797
02:05:35,027 --> 02:05:37,362
It's the big W!

1798
02:05:39,615 --> 02:05:40,532
Look at this.

1799
02:05:40,699 --> 02:05:43,284
Look at it!

1800
02:05:47,957 --> 02:05:49,749
I'm sorry, Mrs. Finch.

1801
02:05:51,168 --> 02:05:53,336
I'm afraid it's too late.

1802
02:05:53,504 --> 02:05:55,463
I think they've found it.

1803
02:05:57,007 --> 02:05:59,968
Right here all the time!
He wasn't kidding!

1804
02:06:00,135 --> 02:06:04,305
- He was telling the truth!
- Folks, isn't this great?

1805
02:06:04,974 --> 02:06:07,767
Congratulations. Well done.

1806
02:06:07,935 --> 02:06:11,479
Listen, I think the big boy
should get an extra share.

1807
02:06:11,647 --> 02:06:13,690
After all, it was he who found it.

1808
02:06:13,857 --> 02:06:17,110
Yes! I insist he gets an extra share.

1809
02:06:17,278 --> 02:06:19,571
That's right.
He deserves an extra share.

1810
02:06:19,738 --> 02:06:22,323
- Well, I...
- Let's start digging.

1811
02:06:22,491 --> 02:06:24,659
Suppose somebody comes along.
What do we tell him?

1812
02:06:24,827 --> 02:06:27,579
We're here with
an anthropological expedition.

1813
02:06:27,746 --> 02:06:29,455
- Nah.
- We don't tell them anything!

1814
02:06:29,623 --> 02:06:32,041
We tell them to scram
or we beat their brains in.

1815
02:06:32,835 --> 02:06:34,752
It was a nice dream.

1816
02:06:36,005 --> 02:06:37,922
Lasted almost five minutes.

1817
02:06:47,933 --> 02:06:50,143
Now, don't bug me, I said.

1818
02:06:50,311 --> 02:06:52,061
Faster.

1819
02:06:52,229 --> 02:06:53,938
Come on, dig, dig.

1820
02:06:54,106 --> 02:06:56,149
Faster, faster.

1821
02:06:56,317 --> 02:06:58,985
Faster. Dig. That's it, dig.

1822
02:07:54,083 --> 02:07:55,124
Faster.

1823
02:08:08,764 --> 02:08:11,849
There's not enough room.
You two, out.

1824
02:08:12,017 --> 02:08:13,601
Let us do it.

1825
02:08:19,942 --> 02:08:23,444
Wait. There's not enough room.
You're bugging me.

1826
02:08:23,612 --> 02:08:25,697
- "Bugging"?
- Cut out, cut out.

1827
02:08:25,864 --> 02:08:27,156
What's this "cut out" talk?

1828
02:08:27,324 --> 02:08:29,575
- Out, baby. Out!
- Don't call me baby.

1829
02:08:29,743 --> 02:08:33,371
- Quit arguing!
- Will ya come on?

1830
02:08:44,174 --> 02:08:46,551
- What's that?
- What was that?

1831
02:08:47,970 --> 02:08:49,679
- That's it.
- Sounded like a chest.

1832
02:08:49,847 --> 02:08:52,056
I wonder what's in it.

1833
02:08:52,224 --> 02:08:53,725
Bring it up here!

1834
02:09:00,899 --> 02:09:02,984
There it is!

1835
02:09:03,152 --> 02:09:04,986
- It's a satchel.
- Hold it up!

1836
02:09:06,488 --> 02:09:09,699
- It's a satchel!
- I got it.

1837
02:09:10,743 --> 02:09:11,993
Open it up.

1838
02:09:12,161 --> 02:09:13,494
Come on!

1839
02:09:15,831 --> 02:09:17,623
Bingo!

1840
02:09:18,417 --> 02:09:21,502
I say, chaps,
shouldn't we find a spot of cover?

1841
02:09:21,670 --> 02:09:22,837
There's nobody around.

1842
02:09:23,005 --> 02:09:24,505
Come on. Count it out.

1843
02:09:24,673 --> 02:09:26,966
- What are we waiting for?
- Now wait a second!

1844
02:09:27,134 --> 02:09:31,345
Everybody's going to get something, so
no arguments. We all get equal shares!

1845
02:09:31,513 --> 02:09:32,680
He's right.

1846
02:09:32,848 --> 02:09:35,767
That's the only way to do it.
Shares for everybody.

1847
02:09:35,934 --> 02:09:38,060
Now, how many are we?

1848
02:09:38,228 --> 02:09:40,104
One, two...

1849
02:09:40,272 --> 02:09:44,567
...three, four, five,
six, seven, eight...

1850
02:09:45,444 --> 02:09:50,198
...9, 10, 11, 12, 13...

1851
02:09:50,365 --> 02:09:52,575
...14, 15.

1852
02:09:52,743 --> 02:09:55,369
15 of us. That means 15 equal shares.

1853
02:09:55,537 --> 02:09:59,123
You dirty double-crosser.
You cut yourself in for twice!

1854
02:09:59,291 --> 02:10:01,334
You can't get away with that!

1855
02:10:01,710 --> 02:10:02,794
Get him!

1856
02:10:02,961 --> 02:10:04,212
Grab him!

1857
02:10:04,379 --> 02:10:05,755
Get him!

1858
02:10:07,841 --> 02:10:11,344
You only cheated yourself
because now you're out.

1859
02:10:11,512 --> 02:10:15,181
Listen!
You can't cut me out now, you hear?

1860
02:10:15,349 --> 02:10:17,099
Not after what I've been through!

1861
02:10:18,060 --> 02:10:19,560
All right. Okay.

1862
02:10:19,728 --> 02:10:23,856
I'm warning you, if I don't get a share,
I'm going straight to the police.

1863
02:10:24,024 --> 02:10:27,276
- The police?
- What makes you think the police...

1864
02:10:27,986 --> 02:10:30,154
That money had to come from somewhere.

1865
02:10:30,322 --> 02:10:34,742
We know where it's from,
that poor man that died on the mountain.

1866
02:10:34,910 --> 02:10:37,328
You wasn't even there, so shut up.

1867
02:10:37,496 --> 02:10:40,873
Okay, you asked for it.
I'm going straight to the police.

1868
02:10:41,041 --> 02:10:43,543
You think they'd be interested,
Mr. Meyer?

1869
02:10:43,710 --> 02:10:46,128
Are you kidding? Isn't it obvious?

1870
02:10:46,296 --> 02:10:47,922
How do you think money gets...

1871
02:10:51,301 --> 02:10:52,760
How did you know my name?

1872
02:10:52,928 --> 02:10:54,345
You know this crook?

1873
02:10:54,513 --> 02:10:59,475
I've never met him, Mr. Pike,
but I've come to feel that I know him.

1874
02:11:00,435 --> 02:11:03,437
How did you know my name?
I've never met you.

1875
02:11:03,605 --> 02:11:06,357
Yeah, who are you?

1876
02:11:06,525 --> 02:11:08,067
Didn't he come with you?

1877
02:11:08,235 --> 02:11:11,153
He didn't come with us.
We thought he came with you.

1878
02:11:11,321 --> 02:11:12,613
No.

1879
02:11:12,781 --> 02:11:16,993
If he didn't come with us,
then who are you?

1880
02:11:17,870 --> 02:11:19,954
I'm Capt. Culpeper...

1881
02:11:20,122 --> 02:11:22,248
...of the Santa Rosita
Police Department.

1882
02:11:27,754 --> 02:11:30,256
- Will you come to the point?
- Yeah, I'm coming to it.

1883
02:11:30,424 --> 02:11:34,135
Point is, I have enough stuff
in my private files...

1884
02:11:34,303 --> 02:11:36,470
...stuff relating to civic building...

1885
02:11:36,638 --> 02:11:39,891
...road contracts,
harbor and cannery projects...

1886
02:11:40,058 --> 02:11:42,810
...enough stuff to put you,
the D.A., myself...

1887
02:11:42,978 --> 02:11:47,315
...and a two-thirds majority behind bars
for the next 20 years.

1888
02:11:47,482 --> 02:11:51,485
And I give you my word, that's
exactly where everybody's going...

1889
02:11:51,653 --> 02:11:56,032
...unless things start happening now.
- Like what, for instance?

1890
02:11:56,199 --> 02:11:59,285
I want the pension
for Culpeper's grade trebled.

1891
02:11:59,453 --> 02:12:03,748
Not doubled, trebled.
I want Culpeper to retire with honor.

1892
02:12:03,916 --> 02:12:08,002
I want it on paper that
that's exactly what's going to happen.

1893
02:12:08,170 --> 02:12:10,963
And I want it in my hands
in 15 minutes...

1894
02:12:11,131 --> 02:12:14,091
...or I'll have all the reporters
in town in here in 20.

1895
02:12:14,843 --> 02:12:19,096
You know the word for this, Your Honor.
It's called blackmail.

1896
02:12:37,324 --> 02:12:41,077
Sir, could you possibly see
your way clear to give us a break?

1897
02:12:41,244 --> 02:12:43,329
You kidding? Him give you a break?

1898
02:12:43,497 --> 02:12:46,290
We had a pretty rough day already.

1899
02:12:46,458 --> 02:12:50,044
We was all covered with dirt,
and we fell down in an airplane...

1900
02:12:50,212 --> 02:12:52,838
...and my grandmother's dying in Oxnard.

1901
02:12:53,006 --> 02:12:55,216
I know we don't deserve
any kindness, Captain.

1902
02:12:55,384 --> 02:12:59,345
But if you could help us,
I'm sure we'd all be inspired...

1903
02:12:59,513 --> 02:13:01,222
...to live better lives.

1904
02:13:01,390 --> 02:13:03,474
Well, there is one thing.

1905
02:13:04,434 --> 02:13:06,769
I don't know
whether it would help or not.

1906
02:13:06,937 --> 02:13:11,273
But if, instead of my turning you in...

1907
02:13:11,441 --> 02:13:13,901
...you went and turned yourselves in...

1908
02:13:14,069 --> 02:13:17,905
...juries sometimes look very favorably
on things like that.

1909
02:13:18,073 --> 02:13:20,574
You'd let us do that?

1910
02:13:20,742 --> 02:13:23,160
What are we waiting for?
Let's turn ourselves in.

1911
02:13:23,328 --> 02:13:24,912
You must be a fine human being.

1912
02:13:25,080 --> 02:13:27,832
After all, why should you worry
whether we get a break?

1913
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:31,085
Well, Mr. Meyer,
no matter what you've all done today...

1914
02:13:31,253 --> 02:13:34,422
...you're not really criminals.

1915
02:13:34,589 --> 02:13:37,508
So if you like,
you can all hop into those two cabs...

1916
02:13:37,676 --> 02:13:40,720
...and drive over to Santa Rosita...

1917
02:13:40,887 --> 02:13:44,098
...and, uh, just walk in.

1918
02:13:44,266 --> 02:13:47,768
- Then let's do that.
- But, sir, we can't all fit.

1919
02:13:47,936 --> 02:13:52,231
You can't take the stolen vehicles.
Those have to stay to be picked up.

1920
02:13:52,399 --> 02:13:55,192
- What are we waiting for?
- Let's go.

1921
02:13:57,112 --> 02:13:58,779
Back in the back.

1922
02:14:01,992 --> 02:14:03,034
Drive carefully.

1923
02:14:03,201 --> 02:14:05,745
They may be the last passengers
you'll ever carry.

1924
02:14:05,912 --> 02:14:07,413
Funny. That's funny.

1925
02:14:07,581 --> 02:14:08,789
Funny, right? Funny?

1926
02:14:08,957 --> 02:14:11,792
You could be the most
comical cop I ever met.

1927
02:14:11,960 --> 02:14:13,085
Yeah.

1928
02:14:40,489 --> 02:14:42,823
- Culpeper.
- Yes, sir.

1929
02:14:43,450 --> 02:14:45,785
Everything is under control here.

1930
02:14:45,952 --> 02:14:49,038
It'll take a little longer
because there was a joker in the deck...

1931
02:14:49,206 --> 02:14:51,665
...that nobody knew about. All right?

1932
02:14:51,833 --> 02:14:53,375
Yes, sir.

1933
02:14:53,543 --> 02:14:56,712
So don't make a move of any kind
until you hear from me.

1934
02:14:56,880 --> 02:14:57,922
Yes, sir.

1935
02:15:04,763 --> 02:15:08,766
Listen, why does the man
want to give everybody a break?

1936
02:15:08,934 --> 02:15:11,894
- What's his angle there?
- I was wondering about that, too.

1937
02:15:12,062 --> 02:15:15,689
Something funny's going on.
How's he know what we're going to do?

1938
02:15:15,857 --> 02:15:18,317
We're in enough of a mess.
We better do what he said.

1939
02:15:18,485 --> 02:15:20,861
I'm tellin' you,
the man has got some angle.

1940
02:15:21,029 --> 02:15:22,613
Wait, wait. Hold it!

1941
02:15:22,781 --> 02:15:24,073
Can you see him?

1942
02:15:34,126 --> 02:15:37,753
- Just what does he think he's doing?
- That certainly is strange.

1943
02:15:37,921 --> 02:15:40,005
- Sure is.
- What is he doing?

1944
02:15:40,173 --> 02:15:43,384
- He's going the other way.
- Why are we standing here?

1945
02:15:43,552 --> 02:15:46,470
That's it!

1946
02:15:46,638 --> 02:15:48,889
We're off the hook!

1947
02:15:49,558 --> 02:15:52,226
Get out of here! Come on, we're off!

1948
02:15:52,394 --> 02:15:54,061
Come on, get going.

1949
02:16:06,741 --> 02:16:09,577
- Ah!
- Holy mackerel. Almost didn't make it.

1950
02:16:24,676 --> 02:16:27,094
No other cops around. He planned it.

1951
02:16:27,262 --> 02:16:31,140
We found the money and he was waiting
to take it away from us.

1952
02:16:31,308 --> 02:16:35,603
But if we all find the money first
and turn it in, we're all in the clear.

1953
02:16:35,770 --> 02:16:38,939
Let's just get the dough
and worry about the rest later.

1954
02:16:39,107 --> 02:16:42,401
- Look. He's slowing down.
- No, he's turning to the left.

1955
02:17:35,121 --> 02:17:36,830
What's going on?

1956
02:17:36,998 --> 02:17:38,457
Sorry, Jimmy.

1957
02:18:30,343 --> 02:18:32,261
He's heading for the border!

1958
02:18:32,429 --> 02:18:34,430
We should stop
and call the police station!

1959
02:18:34,597 --> 02:18:35,723
You shut up!

1960
02:18:35,890 --> 02:18:38,726
We're going to get that money.
Keep driving!

1961
02:18:38,893 --> 02:18:41,228
That woman is something else.

1962
02:18:41,396 --> 02:18:43,230
Take your foot off the brake!

1963
02:18:43,398 --> 02:18:44,898
Stop hitting me. I'm driving.

1964
02:18:45,066 --> 02:18:48,402
- When you want a cab, you can't get one.
- Yeah, come on, let's go!

1965
02:18:57,412 --> 02:18:59,413
F-14 to Central.

1966
02:18:59,581 --> 02:19:00,998
Come in. What is it?

1967
02:19:01,166 --> 02:19:02,750
There's something phony here.

1968
02:19:02,917 --> 02:19:05,794
We're on 101 by Cortez
checking a mad-dog report.

1969
02:19:05,962 --> 02:19:07,755
Orders were to maintain silence.

1970
02:19:07,922 --> 02:19:10,215
Capt. Culpeper wants
this channel kept clear.

1971
02:19:10,383 --> 02:19:12,092
We know it,
but we saw Capt. Culpeper.

1972
02:19:12,260 --> 02:19:15,304
He just went by doing 90 miles an hour.

1973
02:19:16,181 --> 02:19:18,474
I don't think I understand that.

1974
02:19:19,100 --> 02:19:20,934
Are you sure it was Capt. Culpeper?

1975
02:19:21,102 --> 02:19:23,103
- Yep.
- Was he chasing anybody?

1976
02:19:23,271 --> 02:19:25,814
- Nope.
- Could he have been chasing anybody?

1977
02:19:25,982 --> 02:19:29,026
Not a chance.
That's what struck us so funny.

1978
02:19:29,194 --> 02:19:32,237
There were about 15 people
in two cabs behind him.

1979
02:19:32,405 --> 02:19:34,281
It looked like they were chasing him.

1980
02:19:34,449 --> 02:19:37,534
They were chasing him?
What's going on here?

1981
02:19:37,702 --> 02:19:39,870
I brought it myself.
Everything you asked for.

1982
02:19:40,038 --> 02:19:41,288
- The pension?
- Yeah.

1983
02:19:41,456 --> 02:19:43,874
Call Capt. Culpeper.

1984
02:19:44,042 --> 02:19:47,002
Calling Capt. Culpeper.
Central Division. Urgent.

1985
02:19:47,170 --> 02:19:49,963
Calling Capt. Culpeper.

1986
02:19:58,431 --> 02:20:02,351
- This can only happen in America.
- You going to start that again?

1987
02:20:33,508 --> 02:20:36,885
You've got to believe me.
I'm going to be sick.

1988
02:21:49,542 --> 02:21:52,211
What's the matter?
You trying to kill us?

1989
02:21:52,378 --> 02:21:55,339
Just don't make me nervous!

1990
02:22:29,791 --> 02:22:32,918
- Don't let him get away!
- Cut him off!

1991
02:22:37,757 --> 02:22:41,802
Calling Capt. Culpeper.
Culp, this is Aloysius speaking.

1992
02:22:41,970 --> 02:22:45,472
Now, listen to me, Culp.
Everything has been fixed.

1993
02:22:45,640 --> 02:22:48,308
There's been negotiations
and everything is all right.

1994
02:22:48,476 --> 02:22:51,019
Cut out this nonsense and answer me.

1995
02:22:51,187 --> 02:22:53,188
This is Aloysius speaking.

1996
02:23:03,616 --> 02:23:07,744
I still don't understand this.
What's it all about?

1997
02:23:07,912 --> 02:23:10,289
Um... That's it.

1998
02:23:12,667 --> 02:23:14,209
All units...

1999
02:23:14,377 --> 02:23:16,128
...arrest Capt. Culpeper.

2000
02:23:18,047 --> 02:23:20,173
There he is!

2001
02:23:25,471 --> 02:23:28,223
- Come back!
- Get me out of here!

2002
02:23:28,391 --> 02:23:30,601
Just don't sit there. Come on.

2003
02:23:33,146 --> 02:23:34,271
Come on!

2004
02:23:45,533 --> 02:23:47,367
Stop pushing, will ya?

2005
02:23:47,827 --> 02:23:51,121
Wait. We got him.
Now, you women stay here.

2006
02:23:51,289 --> 02:23:53,165
What do you mean,
"You women stay here"?

2007
02:23:53,333 --> 02:23:54,875
You heard him, mother. Stay here!

2008
02:23:55,043 --> 02:23:56,668
Come on! Let's go!

2009
02:24:12,435 --> 02:24:15,771
- Is he there?
- Where'd he go?

2010
02:24:15,938 --> 02:24:17,439
Halt! Halt!

2011
02:24:17,607 --> 02:24:19,524
Now, wait a minute. Listen.

2012
02:24:28,785 --> 02:24:31,411
Yeah!

2013
02:25:36,477 --> 02:25:39,312
Stop pushing! Get the suitcase.

2014
02:25:41,149 --> 02:25:42,899
Look! Look up there!

2015
02:25:43,067 --> 02:25:45,277
...in this regard,
and there is no doubt...

2016
02:25:46,487 --> 02:25:48,655
Hey! Hey!

2017
02:25:51,659 --> 02:25:53,285
Those ladders are not safe!

2018
02:25:53,453 --> 02:25:56,663
Ladders are not safe!

2019
02:26:02,670 --> 02:26:04,796
Get off!

2020
02:26:04,964 --> 02:26:06,840
- You got it?
- Get it away.

2021
02:26:14,015 --> 02:26:15,974
Get moving!

2022
02:26:16,142 --> 02:26:18,018
Don't push. You got it? That's it.

2023
02:26:24,192 --> 02:26:27,694
Sylvester, what are you doing up there?
You must be out of your mind!

2024
02:26:31,199 --> 02:26:34,075
- Wait a minute!
- Get the suitcase!

2025
02:26:39,040 --> 02:26:40,499
Get that money!

2026
02:27:01,229 --> 02:27:03,730
Don't you dare touch any of that money.

2027
02:27:16,369 --> 02:27:19,371
- You! Don't stand there!
- To your right!

2028
02:27:31,175 --> 02:27:32,634
Russell, hang on!

2029
02:27:36,430 --> 02:27:38,306
Dingy, I can't hold on!

2030
02:27:40,434 --> 02:27:41,643
Help us!

2031
02:27:45,231 --> 02:27:47,023
Get off my hand!

2032
02:28:07,962 --> 02:28:09,754
Move onto the ladder!

2033
02:28:11,132 --> 02:28:15,635
Hold on! Wait a minute!
One at a time! Did you hear me?

2034
02:28:15,803 --> 02:28:17,053
One at a time!

2035
02:28:20,141 --> 02:28:21,725
All right!

2036
02:28:21,893 --> 02:28:24,895
All right, you'll see. You'll see.

2037
02:28:26,439 --> 02:28:29,316
Get on alphabetical. I'm Benjy.

2038
02:28:29,483 --> 02:28:32,360
Quit stepping on my head!

2039
02:28:32,528 --> 02:28:36,156
Get on the ladder.

2040
02:28:36,324 --> 02:28:38,658
Don't leave me! Come back here!

2041
02:28:38,826 --> 02:28:40,577
You can't leave me!

2042
02:28:46,959 --> 02:28:49,544
There's too many men
on it to control it.

2043
02:29:18,824 --> 02:29:21,534
Hold it steady. Watch it.
She's whipping loose.

2044
02:29:54,527 --> 02:29:56,111
Ah!

2045
02:29:57,571 --> 02:29:59,072
Whoo!

2046
02:30:00,992 --> 02:30:03,994
Wind us down! Wind us down!

2047
02:30:07,039 --> 02:30:09,416
I don't want the money!

2048
02:30:13,587 --> 02:30:14,796
Look out!

2049
02:30:23,014 --> 02:30:24,264
Get off!

2050
02:30:24,432 --> 02:30:26,433
She's going! Get out of there!

2051
02:31:02,928 --> 02:31:05,972
Emmeline!

2052
02:31:07,058 --> 02:31:09,267
Mama!

2053
02:31:49,934 --> 02:31:52,393
It's all your fault.

2054
02:31:52,561 --> 02:31:55,313
It's your fault from beginning to end.

2055
02:31:55,481 --> 02:31:58,650
You know, even for a policeman...

2056
02:31:58,818 --> 02:32:01,945
...your behavior was ruddy outrageous.

2057
02:32:02,113 --> 02:32:04,739
You could've taken a fair share
like the rest of us...

2058
02:32:04,907 --> 02:32:09,160
...but no, you had to grab up
the whole scene, baby.

2059
02:32:09,328 --> 02:32:14,624
We had $350,000 right in our hands.

2060
02:32:14,792 --> 02:32:18,336
Fourteen into $350,000...

2061
02:32:18,504 --> 02:32:20,880
Shut up.

2062
02:32:23,050 --> 02:32:25,885
I wish I knew what
they were gonna do to us.

2063
02:32:26,053 --> 02:32:31,349
But no matter what happens to us, I hope
what happens to you will be worse.

2064
02:32:33,561 --> 02:32:36,729
I don't think you have to worry
too much about that.

2065
02:32:36,897 --> 02:32:38,857
My wife is divorcing me.

2066
02:32:39,900 --> 02:32:42,652
My mother-in-law
is suing me for damages.

2067
02:32:43,946 --> 02:32:47,574
My daughter is applying to the courts
to have her name changed.

2068
02:32:48,701 --> 02:32:50,743
My pension has been revoked.

2069
02:32:50,911 --> 02:32:54,539
And the only reason
that you 10 idiots...

2070
02:32:55,374 --> 02:32:58,751
...will very likely get off lightly...

2071
02:32:58,919 --> 02:33:03,173
...is because the judge will have
me up there to throw the book at.

2072
02:33:03,340 --> 02:33:05,800
Aw, that's tough. Oh!

2073
02:33:09,597 --> 02:33:14,350
I'd like to think that sometime,
maybe 10 or 20 years from now...

2074
02:33:15,519 --> 02:33:18,730
...there'd be something
I could laugh at, anything.

2075
02:33:28,616 --> 02:33:32,076
Now, see here, you idiots,
it's all your fault because...

2076
02:33:32,244 --> 02:33:34,037
Oh!

2077
02:33:34,205 --> 02:33:38,291
Mama!

2078
02:33:46,133 --> 02:33:48,301
Get away from me!

2079
02:33:48,469 --> 02:33:49,761
Let me go!

2080
02:34:15,079 --> 02:34:20,333
â™ª Mad

2081
02:34:20,501 --> 02:34:22,168
â™ª World â™ª
