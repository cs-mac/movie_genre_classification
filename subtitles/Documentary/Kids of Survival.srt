1
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,442
<i>The last time anyone counted,</i>

2
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:29,528
<i>53 million people
were dying every year.</i>

3
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:33,447
<i>150 thousand every day
and 107 every minute.</i>

4
00:00:33,448 --> 00:00:35,825
<i>That was in normal times.</i>

5
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:40,828
<i>Now, every one of those dead people
gets up and kills another person,</i>

6
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:43,747
<i>and every one of those gets
up and kills.</i>

7
00:00:43,748 --> 00:00:50,004
<i>On top of that, suicide,
murder, chaos and us...</i>

8
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:51,461
<i>the guard...</i>

9
00:00:51,462 --> 00:00:54,422
<i>we added more than out fair
share to the body count, but...</i>

10
00:00:54,423 --> 00:00:56,381
<i>...it didn't do any good.</i>

11
00:00:56,382 --> 00:00:58,467
<i>Get a stretcher over here.
Move it.</i>

12
00:00:58,468 --> 00:01:00,593
<i>The dead were coming back to life.</i>

13
00:01:00,595 --> 00:01:03,450
<i>We should have been afraid
of them. But we weren't.</i>

14
00:01:03,451 --> 00:01:06,911
<i>They were easy enough to
kill, except when they were...</i>

15
00:01:06,912 --> 00:01:09,059
<i>...your buddies.</i>

16
00:01:16,816 --> 00:01:18,902
It's time.

17
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:27,991
You sent us to that hell hole.

18
00:01:28,241 --> 00:01:31,619
You got D.J. killed and
now he's got to get killed again.

19
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:34,122
You fucked up, Lou.

20
00:01:34,455 --> 00:01:36,707
You can't make it right,

21
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:39,585
but you can do the right thing.

22
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,843
I can't.

23
00:02:03,811 --> 00:02:07,814
Don't. Don't.

24
00:02:29,457 --> 00:02:30,331
So there.

25
00:02:30,332 --> 00:02:32,624
<i>- Can I get some backup up here?</i>
- This sucks.

26
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:33,792
<i>We got shots fired.</i>

27
00:02:33,793 --> 00:02:36,072
I never signed up for this shit.

28
00:02:36,545 --> 00:02:39,214
We're better off on our own.

29
00:02:39,882 --> 00:02:41,890
<i>What the hell's going on?</i>

30
00:02:42,424 --> 00:02:44,301
<i>Who's down?</i>

31
00:02:51,223 --> 00:02:54,976
<i>We went AWOL right around the
same time the rest of the world did.</i>

32
00:02:55,143 --> 00:02:57,186
<i>We became stick up guys.</i>

33
00:02:57,187 --> 00:02:58,937
<i>Stopping people on the road...</i>

34
00:02:58,938 --> 00:03:01,022
- Hi there.
<i>- ... taking whatever they had.</i>

35
00:03:01,023 --> 00:03:05,109
- Is it nice to see you guys.
<i>- We held up this bunch of kids in a Winnebago...</i>

36
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,775
<i>...shooting a documentary
about themselves.</i>

37
00:03:06,777 --> 00:03:09,570
- What's with the camera?
- Just making a movie.

38
00:03:09,571 --> 00:03:12,155
Oh, that so.

39
00:03:12,156 --> 00:03:14,532
<i>Fucking movie went out on the net.</i>

40
00:03:14,534 --> 00:03:16,551
<i>- Millions of hits.</i>
- Where did you get all the stuff?

41
00:03:16,552 --> 00:03:18,244
<i>I became notorious...</i>

42
00:03:18,245 --> 00:03:20,788
<i>- ...could of got an agent.</i>
- Mind turning that off son.

43
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:24,167
<i>Made a fortune if there
was anyone left to care.</i>

44
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,500
Turn it the fuck off!

45
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:30,452
<i>It had become an us versus
them world...</i> Now!

46
00:03:30,462 --> 00:03:32,763
<i>...all we were looking for was
a place where there was no...</i>

47
00:03:32,764 --> 00:03:34,349
<i>"Them"</i>

48
00:03:36,992 --> 00:03:42,089
Subtitles by awaqeded.

49
00:04:13,371 --> 00:04:16,247
Well, that's another one we
don't have to worry about.

50
00:04:16,248 --> 00:04:17,248
Amen.

51
00:04:17,249 --> 00:04:20,167
I would like it if you just say
an Amen to put an end to all this.

52
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:22,378
I'd like it too, Captain. I would.

53
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:23,629
Are you all with me then?

54
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,505
Aye, aye Captain.

55
00:04:24,506 --> 00:04:26,213
Damn right.

56
00:04:26,215 --> 00:04:27,798
I'm asking.

57
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:29,590
Are all of you with me?

58
00:04:29,591 --> 00:04:32,426
You're being too strict,
just as you always been.

59
00:04:32,427 --> 00:04:34,094
Being strict is a father's burden.

60
00:04:34,096 --> 00:04:36,388
More like a daughter's burden,
if you ask me.

61
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:37,890
What if I die?

62
00:04:37,891 --> 00:04:39,850
Would you be strict enough to
gun one of your own?

63
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:42,435
- What if you die?
- Don't get your hopes up.

64
00:04:42,436 --> 00:04:45,854
No, I mean it what if you die
and get up and walk?

65
00:04:45,855 --> 00:04:48,480
Would any of us be strict
enough to gun you down?

66
00:04:48,481 --> 00:04:50,566
You won't have to
I'll shoot myself.

67
00:04:50,567 --> 00:04:52,109
You might change your view of things.

68
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,781
Dying don't change a person's view's

69
00:04:53,782 --> 00:04:56,187
all a dead man can do is
remember what he used to be

70
00:04:56,188 --> 00:04:58,072
and keep on trying to be the same.

71
00:04:58,073 --> 00:05:00,409
On to the next.

72
00:05:00,784 --> 00:05:02,617
<i>We weren't there
in the beginning.</i>

73
00:05:02,618 --> 00:05:05,203
<i>We heard about what
happened afterwards.</i>

74
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:08,005
<i>This old coot Patrick
O'Flynn decided that the</i>

75
00:05:08,031 --> 00:05:11,130
<i>living would be better off
if the dead stayed dead.</i>

76
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,378
<i>Put a posse together and went around
the island trying to clean things up.</i>

77
00:05:16,963 --> 00:05:19,005
<i>Not everybody was on his side.</i>

78
00:05:19,006 --> 00:05:21,049
Let's go.

79
00:05:26,054 --> 00:05:31,142
<i>Law enforcement advises that if anyone is
forced to defend themselves against attack.</i>

80
00:05:31,143 --> 00:05:34,059
<i>Make every effort to incapacitate
the attacker's brain.</i>

81
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,228
Any news from town?

82
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,688
No.

83
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:41,564
I'm just gonna sit and wait awhile.

84
00:05:41,565 --> 00:05:43,608
For what, a miracle?

85
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:48,487
Been known to happen,
if you believe what the book says.

86
00:05:48,488 --> 00:05:50,031
Are they all settled in up there?

87
00:05:50,032 --> 00:05:51,824
All settled in.

88
00:05:52,156 --> 00:05:54,513
No commotions?

89
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,204
None that I've heard.

90
00:06:07,378 --> 00:06:09,169
Patrick O'Flynn.

91
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,443
Matthew Muldoon.

92
00:06:13,215 --> 00:06:16,697
I know we're conserving, but...

93
00:06:18,052 --> 00:06:19,886
Where are your children?

94
00:06:19,887 --> 00:06:21,513
Upstairs.

95
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,098
They're in bed.

96
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:27,392
It came to me that one of them had
an accident a couple of days ago.

97
00:06:27,393 --> 00:06:31,062
Yeah the girl fell off her bike, so...

98
00:06:31,063 --> 00:06:33,378
And the boy?

99
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:38,464
- Went to help her and...
- Got hit by a car didn't he?

100
00:06:38,652 --> 00:06:42,445
Is the boy all
right Matthew or not?

101
00:06:42,446 --> 00:06:44,947
I believe whatever you tell me.

102
00:06:44,948 --> 00:06:49,953
- He's ah...
- Maybe I should go upstairs and look for myself.

103
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:53,537
Don't you go up there.

104
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,788
Beth, I have to do this.

105
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,207
You don't have to do this
you enjoy doing it.

106
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,917
No, I promise you that

107
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,628
I don't want to go upstairs. I don't
want to see what your boys become.

108
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:04,671
He ain't become nothing.

109
00:07:04,672 --> 00:07:07,632
He is still just and only my boy.

110
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:09,593
Don't do it Beth!

111
00:07:10,928 --> 00:07:12,596
Beth!

112
00:07:23,562 --> 00:07:25,480
Oh, my God.

113
00:07:25,481 --> 00:07:28,900
You damn stupid fool.
You might have stopped this.

114
00:07:29,568 --> 00:07:32,069
- How?
- By telling me the truth.

115
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,986
What you wanna do with her now?
Take her upstairs and put her to bed?

116
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:38,532
No, I'll do what I have to do.

117
00:07:39,575 --> 00:07:42,202
If you'll just give me the means.

118
00:08:40,247 --> 00:08:42,290
It's both of them.

119
00:08:57,011 --> 00:08:59,680
I'll do it, I will.

120
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:05,267
But I'd give my soul if someone
will step up and do it for me.

121
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:07,393
No one's going to help you.

122
00:09:07,394 --> 00:09:10,188
Not this time, not children.

123
00:09:21,738 --> 00:09:24,741
There's been enough
killing for one day.

124
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:32,329
You boys must not have heard me.

125
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:35,207
I said there's
been enough killing.

126
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,544
You have us out numbered the way the Muldoons
have outnumbered the O'Flynn's from the beginning.

127
00:09:41,545 --> 00:09:43,546
Now, listen to me, Seamus.

128
00:09:43,547 --> 00:09:45,339
Plum's always been a safe place

129
00:09:45,341 --> 00:09:48,552
where a man can
live a pride for life.

130
00:09:48,926 --> 00:09:51,344
We can keep it that way

131
00:09:51,345 --> 00:09:54,805
but only if we do
what we have to do.

132
00:09:54,806 --> 00:09:58,642
Killing our own kind like
they didn't belong to us.

133
00:09:58,643 --> 00:10:01,393
Putting the dead to sleep,

134
00:10:01,395 --> 00:10:03,978
before they put
all of us to sleep.

135
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:05,271
I have faith.

136
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:08,691
The day of Judgment will forgive
me and prove me right.

137
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:11,236
You're are wrong, Muldoon.

138
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:15,447
What are you going
to do with them?

139
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,866
Their Muldoons,
it's up to me to save them.

140
00:10:18,867 --> 00:10:21,534
You can't save a person
who is already dead.

141
00:10:21,536 --> 00:10:23,035
Maybe they're not dead.

142
00:10:23,036 --> 00:10:26,539
Maybe they got some kind
of sickness or something.

143
00:10:26,664 --> 00:10:28,707
Somebody's gonna find
a cure for this.

144
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:33,170
It might take 100 years
but somebody's going to find a cure.

145
00:10:33,962 --> 00:10:38,673
The only families who ever lived on
this island were yours and mine.

146
00:10:38,674 --> 00:10:43,052
No strangers, until now.

147
00:10:43,053 --> 00:10:46,681
There's a stranger in our mist
Patrick O'Flynn.

148
00:10:47,723 --> 00:10:49,724
And it's you...

149
00:10:51,935 --> 00:10:54,604
Lay down your hardware.

150
00:11:01,776 --> 00:11:06,030
Now outside, all of ya.

151
00:11:23,168 --> 00:11:25,879
What's going to happen to him?

152
00:11:25,961 --> 00:11:28,755
If he don't turn my way...

153
00:11:29,463 --> 00:11:32,090
...I'll have to shoot him.

154
00:11:32,382 --> 00:11:34,301
Seamus.

155
00:11:35,218 --> 00:11:37,595
He's my dad.

156
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,954
I need to be rid of him.

157
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:46,958
This island needs
to be rid of him.

158
00:11:47,436 --> 00:11:50,334
You can put him on a boat.

159
00:12:04,867 --> 00:12:07,200
Who's coming with me?

160
00:12:07,201 --> 00:12:09,035
I've been with you
a long time, Captain.

161
00:12:09,036 --> 00:12:11,246
So I'll stick.

162
00:12:20,295 --> 00:12:21,504
That all?

163
00:12:21,505 --> 00:12:23,088
We like it here, Patrick.

164
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:27,176
We think the best way of seeing
this through is here on Plum.

165
00:12:29,219 --> 00:12:31,346
Come along, Janet.

166
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:34,015
I like it here too, Dad.

167
00:12:34,473 --> 00:12:36,765
So you're leaving me now?

168
00:12:36,766 --> 00:12:38,977
I'm not leaving.

169
00:12:39,268 --> 00:12:41,395
You are.

170
00:12:44,857 --> 00:12:49,569
If there wasn't any Muldoons
none of us would be leaving.

171
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,652
<i>This crowd is dead!</i>

172
00:13:16,832 --> 00:13:19,169
<i>Here's another one. I don't think
you're going to get this one.</i>

173
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:21,434
<i>Stump me, stump me.</i>

174
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:23,461
<i>Why are zombies
good at oral sex?</i>

175
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:25,929
<i>Why are zombies good at oral
sex? I don't know.</i>

176
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,287
<i>Because they'll eat anything you
put in front of them.</i>

177
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,471
<i>- Did you write that one?
- Well I just made it up right here.</i>

178
00:13:37,773 --> 00:13:40,192
<i>- Why don't Zombies eat politicians?
- I don't know.</i>

179
00:13:40,193 --> 00:13:42,277
<i>Professional courtesy.</i>

180
00:13:46,238 --> 00:13:49,949
- Garbage.
- I think it's funny.

181
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:52,118
I haven't been able to
get a signal for days.

182
00:13:52,119 --> 00:13:53,117
So there.

183
00:13:53,118 --> 00:13:56,036
I'm telling you man all the
wrong people are dying.

184
00:13:56,037 --> 00:13:58,997
Seems like all we
got left is assholes.

185
00:13:58,998 --> 00:14:00,171
<i>...best way to feed a deadhead?</i>

186
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,147
Deadheads.
Their calling them Deadheads now.

187
00:14:02,185 --> 00:14:04,813
The whole world is
going fucking mental.

188
00:14:05,295 --> 00:14:06,920
Hi, mamacita.

189
00:14:06,921 --> 00:14:09,714
Cut that out will ya,
you're turning me on.

190
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:13,508
I'd let you lick me Franny
but guys just don't know how.

191
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:14,634
You give me 5 minutes

192
00:14:14,635 --> 00:14:16,012
I'll change your life forever.

193
00:14:16,013 --> 00:14:19,596
I don't have 5 minutes amigo
nobody does these days.

194
00:14:19,597 --> 00:14:21,097
That's too bad.

195
00:14:21,098 --> 00:14:25,311
No what's too bad is there is
not another bitch in this litter.

196
00:14:34,567 --> 00:14:38,967
Still generating power
but nobody is around.

197
00:14:40,197 --> 00:14:41,280
Turn that thing off.

198
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:42,448
It's funny.

199
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:44,116
Turn it off now.

200
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:46,035
I hear something.

201
00:14:48,246 --> 00:14:50,790
That ain't far off, come on.

202
00:14:59,295 --> 00:15:01,339
Hey look at this.

203
00:15:01,672 --> 00:15:03,173
Maybe there's money inside.

204
00:15:03,174 --> 00:15:04,924
Money don't mean shit anymore.

205
00:15:04,925 --> 00:15:08,218
Money will always
be money, my friend.

206
00:15:08,219 --> 00:15:10,470
If you have a lot of money
at the end of the world

207
00:15:10,471 --> 00:15:13,599
you can buy yourself a nice
condominium in heaven huh.

208
00:15:15,517 --> 00:15:17,058
Ring around the Rosie.

209
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:19,018
Come in on four sides
and once we're there

210
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:19,936
make some noise.

211
00:15:19,937 --> 00:15:22,856
- Move out.
- Let's go check it out.

212
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:26,566
- I thought she had ya.
- I thought so too.

213
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:28,875
I thought I was dead.

214
00:15:29,254 --> 00:15:31,547
- I nailed her ass didn't I?
- Sure enough did.

215
00:15:31,548 --> 00:15:33,171
I nailed her ass proper.

216
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:36,065
Who was she your momma?

217
00:15:36,576 --> 00:15:38,242
Shit.

218
00:15:38,243 --> 00:15:40,076
How many you out there?

219
00:15:40,077 --> 00:15:42,244
You're out numbered
and out gunned Holmes.

220
00:15:42,245 --> 00:15:44,288
Set that iron down.

221
00:15:44,289 --> 00:15:48,344
You's gonna have to make me
set it down there mandrake.

222
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:51,753
Oh, crap.

223
00:15:51,754 --> 00:15:54,964
Is there anyone else inclined
to point a gun at me?

224
00:15:54,965 --> 00:15:57,340
That's good.

225
00:15:57,341 --> 00:15:59,508
Cause I don't like shooting
people I don't know.

226
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:01,801
Well, maybe we should
get to know each other.

227
00:16:01,802 --> 00:16:04,012
Who the hell would
want to get to know you?

228
00:16:04,013 --> 00:16:06,347
- Two.
- Even I can count better than that.

229
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:09,225
- Three.
- Three is company, senor.

230
00:16:09,226 --> 00:16:11,435
Four. Is a crowd.

231
00:16:11,436 --> 00:16:13,271
Oh, crap.

232
00:16:15,063 --> 00:16:16,689
What the hell's that?

233
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:18,524
Oh, that.

234
00:16:18,525 --> 00:16:20,858
That is just some
fun we was having.

235
00:16:20,859 --> 00:16:21,901
Fun?

236
00:16:21,902 --> 00:16:26,937
Them things out there, they was chasing
us so we done something about it.

237
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,252
Oh, God.

238
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,070
Why did you do that?

239
00:17:17,071 --> 00:17:20,802
They come after us like I said
all in a pack like.

240
00:17:20,803 --> 00:17:24,283
They come after us
so we killed them.

241
00:17:24,284 --> 00:17:25,367
That's right.

242
00:17:25,368 --> 00:17:27,661
There are a lot of ways
you can kill somebody.

243
00:17:27,662 --> 00:17:32,165
For example, if I wanna shoot
you in the head, I'd use this.

244
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:35,627
Now, if I wanted to cut you up
into little pieces, I'd use this.

245
00:17:35,752 --> 00:17:38,713
But then I might blow
up a chunk of the forest.

246
00:17:39,463 --> 00:17:42,151
If I wanted to blow
up a chunk of the forest...

247
00:17:42,152 --> 00:17:45,299
...I'd use one of these bad boys.

248
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,592
But you know what?

249
00:17:46,593 --> 00:17:50,679
I'm thinking I might
save that for a rainy day.

250
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,099
Yeah, you do that bubba...

251
00:17:59,229 --> 00:18:01,229
Don't shoot please.
I'm not one of them, I swear.

252
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,150
Kenny, stop.

253
00:18:06,609 --> 00:18:08,652
I just came along for the ride.

254
00:18:08,653 --> 00:18:11,320
That's a lousy bunch of friends
to be riding around with.

255
00:18:11,321 --> 00:18:13,948
Lousy times make lousy people.

256
00:18:14,115 --> 00:18:16,242
Are you?

257
00:18:16,492 --> 00:18:17,742
Lousy people?

258
00:18:17,743 --> 00:18:19,953
- No.
- Yes

259
00:18:21,246 --> 00:18:23,582
I'm not choosy.

260
00:18:24,623 --> 00:18:26,959
You forgot to finish the job.

261
00:18:33,589 --> 00:18:35,047
You're dangerous, kid.

262
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:37,175
But not as dangerous as me.

263
00:18:37,342 --> 00:18:40,178
You coming or we
leaving you behind, huh?

264
00:18:43,097 --> 00:18:45,099
Just give me a minute.

265
00:18:57,149 --> 00:18:58,608
What are you doing?

266
00:18:58,609 --> 00:19:02,237
- Stealing their shit?
- This is my shit they stole it from me.

267
00:19:06,531 --> 00:19:07,614
What do you think?

268
00:19:07,615 --> 00:19:09,199
Maybe we should take this.

269
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,784
It is better than
those open air Jeeps.

270
00:19:11,785 --> 00:19:12,910
We're going to need keys.

271
00:19:12,911 --> 00:19:15,454
One of those dead guys
back there must have them.

272
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:17,499
Not anymore.

273
00:19:32,594 --> 00:19:34,427
Probably nothing in it anyway.

274
00:19:34,428 --> 00:19:35,928
Who would be stupid enough to

275
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:37,870
leave a bunch of money sitting
in the middle of nowhere?

276
00:19:37,871 --> 00:19:40,749
Those guys look
like geniuses to you?

277
00:19:43,477 --> 00:19:46,979
One million, three hundred
and thirty three dollars.

278
00:19:46,981 --> 00:19:51,568
- You count it?
- No, it's written on a ledger.

279
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:55,777
Can you give us the key?

280
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:59,155
You can have this key.

281
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,573
It starts the truck.

282
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,950
I would like that one.

283
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,869
I don't think so.

284
00:20:09,955 --> 00:20:14,709
Well we are not going to stand here
waiting for this kid to take a shit.

285
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,461
Cisco. Drive.

286
00:20:20,715 --> 00:20:22,507
Hey, Cisco wants to
know where we're going.

287
00:20:22,508 --> 00:20:25,884
We will be hitting I95 soon so
we have two choices, North or south?

288
00:20:25,885 --> 00:20:27,052
South.

289
00:20:27,053 --> 00:20:29,763
- Who died and made you king?
- Just a suggestion.

290
00:20:29,764 --> 00:20:33,778
Don't make any suggestions, all right?
North, Cisco.

291
00:20:33,975 --> 00:20:36,060
Can I ask you why?

292
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:39,813
Going north we got a better
shot of getting closer

293
00:20:40,481 --> 00:20:41,479
to no place.

294
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,897
Yeah, we don't want no place.

295
00:20:42,898 --> 00:20:45,775
We want some place where
the shit can't get at us.

296
00:20:45,776 --> 00:20:47,444
Like where?

297
00:20:47,486 --> 00:20:49,445
Like an island.

298
00:20:49,446 --> 00:20:51,362
Where are we gonna
find an island?

299
00:20:51,363 --> 00:20:53,990
Let me see...
Maybe in the ocean?

300
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:55,408
Don't be a wise ass, kid.

301
00:20:55,409 --> 00:20:57,533
Sorry.

302
00:20:57,534 --> 00:21:00,369
Have you guys ever hear of
this guy, Captain Courageous?

303
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,120
Who?

304
00:21:01,121 --> 00:21:03,957
Online, this guy.

305
00:21:06,501 --> 00:21:08,960
- You call that a computer?
- It is a computer.

306
00:21:08,961 --> 00:21:10,670
Piece of shit, PC.

307
00:21:10,671 --> 00:21:12,047
I think it's cool so there.

308
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:15,800
That is not cool, this is cool.

309
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:25,098
Friends, I am going
to keep this simple.

310
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:28,684
See this isn't a sales pitch,
there's nothing in it for me.

311
00:21:28,685 --> 00:21:31,603
My ass, that ain't a
sales pitch what is it?

312
00:21:31,604 --> 00:21:35,073
This think that's come down
on us, whatever it is.

313
00:21:35,074 --> 00:21:38,274
Don't seem to be able to answer
these questions, but it's terrible.

314
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:41,652
So I am inviting you's to
come on over and join us.

315
00:21:41,653 --> 00:21:43,195
Come on over to Plum.

316
00:21:43,196 --> 00:21:46,156
See it's an island off
the coast of Delaware.

317
00:21:46,157 --> 00:21:47,698
Route 1 to Belford.

318
00:21:47,699 --> 00:21:50,075
Follow the signs
to Slaughter Beach.

319
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:52,786
If you get here I promise
you'll be welcome.

320
00:21:52,787 --> 00:21:57,122
It's a small place,
small and under control.

321
00:21:57,123 --> 00:21:58,540
That part sounds good.

322
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,208
So, think about it.

323
00:22:00,209 --> 00:22:02,336
Come on over.

324
00:22:03,546 --> 00:22:07,047
It's got to be some kind of a scam.
What else can it be, huh?

325
00:22:07,048 --> 00:22:09,132
So this guy finds
some place to escape.

326
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:10,675
Just what we're
all looking for.

327
00:22:10,676 --> 00:22:14,095
Yeah and if we find it I'm not going
to advertise for people to join us.

328
00:22:14,096 --> 00:22:16,638
It's worth a try.
What do we got to lose?

329
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:20,350
I thought we agreed that we
are better off on our own.

330
00:22:21,267 --> 00:22:23,351
Ain't got us very far has it?

331
00:22:23,352 --> 00:22:26,480
I don't want to sign
up with anybody, Kenny.

332
00:22:27,272 --> 00:22:31,025
I'm fucking finished
with signing up, man.

333
00:22:31,026 --> 00:22:31,775
Fuck.

334
00:22:31,776 --> 00:22:34,487
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

335
00:22:40,699 --> 00:22:41,824
That was not cool.

336
00:22:41,825 --> 00:22:45,078
Sarge is just blowing off
a little steam is all.

337
00:22:48,956 --> 00:22:52,208
I never signed up with you
you never signed up with me.

338
00:22:52,209 --> 00:22:54,419
We stick together
because we know.

339
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,169
I take a bullet for you

340
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,295
and you take one for me.

341
00:22:58,296 --> 00:23:00,213
I'd never take a
bullet for anybody.

342
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:05,427
Sarge, going to this island ain't
like signing up with Uncle Sam.

343
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:07,971
Maybe it's just...

344
00:23:08,347 --> 00:23:10,514
...the smart thing to do.

345
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:12,934
So what's the call?
North or South?

346
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,019
South.

347
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,190
95 to Route 1. Slaughter Beach.

348
00:24:31,996 --> 00:24:34,581
Oh, I got a big one.

349
00:25:18,491 --> 00:25:20,158
What the devil was that?

350
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,205
Someone's coming, Captain.

351
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:47,470
There's nobody around.

352
00:25:47,471 --> 00:25:49,638
When a place looks this empty...

353
00:25:49,639 --> 00:25:51,724
...probably not empty at all.

354
00:25:51,725 --> 00:25:52,766
Hello, there.

355
00:25:52,767 --> 00:25:55,435
- See what I mean?
- Nice truck.

356
00:25:55,436 --> 00:25:57,645
You got the crown
jewels in there?

357
00:25:57,647 --> 00:25:59,354
Ain't nothing in
here but us.

358
00:25:59,355 --> 00:26:00,647
We found this
truck on the road.

359
00:26:00,648 --> 00:26:02,023
Somebody else cleaned it out.

360
00:26:02,024 --> 00:26:04,401
You're a big old
bull shitter Sarge.

361
00:26:04,402 --> 00:26:06,234
We're looking to get
over to Plum Island.

362
00:26:06,235 --> 00:26:08,236
You've come to the right place.

363
00:26:08,237 --> 00:26:11,489
I can let you have a rowboat
or one with a motor.

364
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,032
How much for the motorboat?

365
00:26:13,033 --> 00:26:15,992
- All that you got.
- How much for the rowboat?

366
00:26:15,993 --> 00:26:17,952
- All that you got.
- Shit.

367
00:26:17,953 --> 00:26:20,288
This is nothing but an
old fashion stick up.

368
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:23,415
Sucking people in here so
you can take what they got.

369
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:26,126
Things were going pretty
well until you showed up.

370
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:28,046
Deadheads.

371
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:33,923
You come out now or we'll
blow your asses all to hell.

372
00:26:33,924 --> 00:26:38,334
As long as we stay in here you
aren't blowing our asses anywhere.

373
00:26:40,722 --> 00:26:43,438
What are we dicking around for,
let's just drive the hell out of here?

374
00:26:43,439 --> 00:26:46,753
Don't think about driving out of
here the road is mined with TNT.

375
00:26:46,777 --> 00:26:48,862
Lying fuck.

376
00:26:50,312 --> 00:26:52,771
Might be a fuck
but he wasn't lying.

377
00:26:52,772 --> 00:26:55,233
There's no way out.

378
00:26:55,858 --> 00:26:57,943
Yes, there is.

379
00:26:58,819 --> 00:27:00,278
We can drive on to that thing.

380
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:01,696
You just want the money.

381
00:27:01,697 --> 00:27:04,698
I have never been about money,
I have always been about staying alive.

382
00:27:04,699 --> 00:27:07,909
And this tank gives us
a shot at staying alive.

383
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:10,910
The truck may be our savior,
but it won't drive on water.

384
00:27:10,911 --> 00:27:12,728
Well someone is going to
have to swim over there...

385
00:27:12,729 --> 00:27:14,091
...meaning me, and
start that boat up.

386
00:27:14,092 --> 00:27:16,605
What if it won't start?
What if it's out of gas?

387
00:27:16,606 --> 00:27:21,652
Then we're shit out of luck. Cisco, back up to the
edge of the pier. I'm going out the back door.

388
00:27:25,715 --> 00:27:27,215
Cisco, I said back up.

389
00:27:27,217 --> 00:27:28,383
I know how to drive a boat.

390
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,049
Do you know how
to drive a boat?

391
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,315
Yes, I can figure it out.

392
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,110
I don't need to figure it out.

393
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:36,611
Senor, boats they
are like woman.

394
00:27:36,724 --> 00:27:38,016
There isn't one
I can't fire up.

395
00:27:38,017 --> 00:27:40,434
You have a better chance of fucking
that ferry then you do me.

396
00:27:40,435 --> 00:27:44,479
- 5 Minutes dear.
- Yeah, yeah you'll change my life forever.

397
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,857
Cisco, no.

398
00:27:51,986 --> 00:27:53,236
He's swimming out to the ferry.

399
00:27:53,237 --> 00:27:55,071
What would he want
with a ferry boat?

400
00:27:55,072 --> 00:27:58,929
There must be something
worthwhile in that truck.

401
00:28:02,035 --> 00:28:04,204
Shit.

402
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,012
Almost empty I counted

403
00:28:30,891 --> 00:28:33,248
I think I'll just hang on to this.

404
00:28:35,186 --> 00:28:37,615
Fuck.

405
00:28:38,147 --> 00:28:41,233
Those fucking things must
be standing on the bottom.

406
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,210
Guys.

407
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:08,775
Guys.

408
00:29:10,965 --> 00:29:13,425
Shit. Get in the truck.

409
00:29:18,888 --> 00:29:21,557
Oh God. Gracias amigo.

410
00:29:23,099 --> 00:29:25,142
He made it, Captain.

411
00:30:19,643 --> 00:30:21,769
Hey there you go.
Hey there you go.

412
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:23,563
Come on.

413
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:43,828
- How did you get here?
- Swam, same as you.

414
00:30:43,829 --> 00:30:46,204
And your gun? It's wet, no?

415
00:30:46,206 --> 00:30:48,948
Yeah, you never thought
to try yours did you?

416
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:50,917
Well you better try it now.

417
00:30:50,918 --> 00:30:54,240
Try it now, Cisco. What do you
expect me to do all the work?

418
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:02,676
I never knew.

419
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:04,052
I thought if a gun was wet.

420
00:31:04,053 --> 00:31:05,428
Only in the cowboy
movies, Poncho.

421
00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:08,480
Now, come on, we got to get
this puppy up and running.

422
00:31:12,394 --> 00:31:14,521
Okay.

423
00:31:16,564 --> 00:31:18,774
Okay.

424
00:31:21,441 --> 00:31:23,400
Turn the telegraph full ahead.

425
00:31:23,401 --> 00:31:27,155
- What's a telegraph?
- That thing above my head, turn it full ahead.

426
00:31:32,201 --> 00:31:34,370
The boats moving, Captain.

427
00:31:34,411 --> 00:31:36,705
Must not have been out of gas.

428
00:31:40,416 --> 00:31:43,669
Move the truck around
Tomboy we're going on board.

429
00:31:45,211 --> 00:31:47,296
Tomboy.

430
00:31:48,088 --> 00:31:50,257
Where the hell is Tomboy?

431
00:31:50,632 --> 00:31:54,070
How are we going to drive this
onto a boat with nobody driving?

432
00:31:54,801 --> 00:31:56,678
Rainy day kid.

433
00:32:15,568 --> 00:32:18,904
Jesus Christ,
what the fuck was that?

434
00:32:24,658 --> 00:32:28,078
Don't stare at me
start shooting the bastards.

435
00:32:45,674 --> 00:32:47,467
Tawdry.

436
00:32:51,596 --> 00:32:53,264
Got ya!

437
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:57,393
Ah, you're done mate.

438
00:33:06,149 --> 00:33:08,026
Shit.

439
00:33:24,873 --> 00:33:29,940
Well boys, may you get to heaven a few
seconds before the devil knows your dead.

440
00:33:36,965 --> 00:33:38,633
Thanks.

441
00:33:55,688 --> 00:33:57,022
Okay, I got you.

442
00:33:57,023 --> 00:33:59,191
Come on.

443
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:07,196
You're lucky I'm me.

444
00:34:07,197 --> 00:34:09,114
Any of the others would
have left you drown.

445
00:34:09,115 --> 00:34:10,907
In that case I am indeed lucky.

446
00:34:10,908 --> 00:34:14,578
- Which way to Plum?
- East, due east.

447
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:21,750
The man says due east.

448
00:34:21,751 --> 00:34:25,294
Due east? Due east
is the Atlantic Ocean.

449
00:34:25,295 --> 00:34:28,346
Yeah, well, let's hope
there is something in between.

450
00:34:36,637 --> 00:34:39,014
Everything is moldy.

451
00:34:39,514 --> 00:34:41,370
Except these.

452
00:34:48,063 --> 00:34:50,480
You remind me of my daughter.

453
00:34:50,481 --> 00:34:52,690
Yeah? Is she out on Plum?

454
00:34:52,691 --> 00:34:54,358
Far as I know.

455
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:57,902
Good something for both
of us to look forward to.

456
00:34:57,903 --> 00:34:58,903
Oh, you are ah...

457
00:34:58,904 --> 00:35:00,113
Ah, yeah.

458
00:35:00,114 --> 00:35:01,155
I'm ah...

459
00:35:01,156 --> 00:35:04,324
- You got a problem with that?
- Not at all, not at all.

460
00:35:05,035 --> 00:35:06,368
You.

461
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:08,454
I can't help you this time.

462
00:35:08,955 --> 00:35:12,206
How do ya do,
my name is Patrick O'Flynn.

463
00:35:12,207 --> 00:35:15,166
Back on the dock you would have
killed us as soon as look at us.

464
00:35:15,167 --> 00:35:18,711
Well, you know I am the sorta fella
who always has something up his sleeves.

465
00:35:18,712 --> 00:35:21,171
I could kill you right
now if I wanted to.

466
00:35:21,172 --> 00:35:22,130
I could kill you.

467
00:35:22,131 --> 00:35:24,215
Yes you could, yes you could.

468
00:35:24,217 --> 00:35:27,845
I guess it's all about who
pulls the trigger first.

469
00:35:31,013 --> 00:35:32,554
Why do I like you?

470
00:35:32,555 --> 00:35:36,391
Well I've been told by a few
not all that I'm a likeable man.

471
00:35:36,392 --> 00:35:38,226
We are all on the same side.

472
00:35:38,227 --> 00:35:39,811
Those of us living.

473
00:35:39,812 --> 00:35:42,104
- I ain't on your side.
- Ah, but you are.

474
00:35:42,105 --> 00:35:44,483
You just don't know it yet.

475
00:35:50,654 --> 00:35:52,237
First things first.

476
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:55,906
We got to make sure there is no
walking garbage on this scowl.

477
00:35:55,907 --> 00:35:59,786
Careless of you not to have
taken care of it right away.

478
00:36:00,662 --> 00:36:02,372
Heads up.

479
00:36:02,788 --> 00:36:05,040
You want some junk food?

480
00:36:08,459 --> 00:36:09,751
Are you okay?

481
00:36:09,752 --> 00:36:12,421
Si, si, for sure.

482
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,964
You didn't get bit while
you were swimming, did you?

483
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,841
No, I didn't get bit.

484
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:21,051
In fact, I did some
biting on my own.

485
00:36:21,052 --> 00:36:24,347
One of those things
tried to grab me...

486
00:36:24,764 --> 00:36:27,056
...and I bit off
one of his fingers.

487
00:36:27,057 --> 00:36:28,808
You swallow any blood?

488
00:36:28,809 --> 00:36:30,810
No, I don't think so.

489
00:36:30,811 --> 00:36:32,603
There was a lot
of water yeah, but...

490
00:36:32,604 --> 00:36:36,646
...blood, I don't think so.

491
00:36:36,647 --> 00:36:38,606
Tomboy, get your ass down here.

492
00:36:38,607 --> 00:36:41,276
Bring the licorice sticks.

493
00:37:11,592 --> 00:37:13,761
Most of them got out.

494
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,477
This one got out
a different way.

495
00:37:24,478 --> 00:37:26,667
Got one here.

496
00:37:56,086 --> 00:37:57,420
They're getting smart.

497
00:37:57,421 --> 00:37:58,336
Smart?

498
00:37:58,337 --> 00:38:00,128
That thing remembered
how to start his car.

499
00:38:00,129 --> 00:38:03,215
Yeah, but he'll never
pass his drivers test.

500
00:38:05,488 --> 00:38:08,866
I think we got it all cleaned up.

501
00:38:16,144 --> 00:38:18,271
Thanks a lot for your help.

502
00:38:19,978 --> 00:38:24,274
I guess there is no profit
in knocking off dead people?

503
00:38:26,651 --> 00:38:29,444
This ah, island
you been selling.

504
00:38:29,445 --> 00:38:30,737
Many out there?

505
00:38:30,738 --> 00:38:33,739
Oh, it is. It's a lovely spot.

506
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,783
Lovely spot.

507
00:38:35,992 --> 00:38:38,701
But I am no longer welcome.

508
00:38:38,703 --> 00:38:39,661
Why? What did you do?

509
00:38:39,662 --> 00:38:42,498
Nothing to deserve what I got.

510
00:38:44,457 --> 00:38:47,459
Yeah sure I am a bandit
and now I am a thief.

511
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:51,555
Not so bad these days when there is
nothing but thieves some of them

512
00:38:51,556 --> 00:38:56,007
are drawing down big salaries for
just being clever at their craft.

513
00:38:56,008 --> 00:38:58,760
Me, I never drew a salary.

514
00:38:59,469 --> 00:39:02,803
I always relied on how many
fish wandered in to me net.

515
00:39:02,804 --> 00:39:05,765
Now, you cast your
net on the Internet.

516
00:39:06,057 --> 00:39:08,726
Lot of fish in them waters.

517
00:39:10,894 --> 00:39:16,893
I just can't believe we are taking a gamble
on some guy who lies easier than a bed sheet.

518
00:39:16,899 --> 00:39:18,734
Land, ho.

519
00:39:20,986 --> 00:39:22,027
Drop anchor.

520
00:39:22,028 --> 00:39:24,210
Drop anchor out here?
I thought we were going ashore?

521
00:39:24,221 --> 00:39:28,283
Not with this barge there's
no deep water harbors on Plum.

522
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:31,159
We'll take the dingy
it will be better.

523
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,767
Nobody will see us coming.

524
00:39:54,012 --> 00:39:56,785
Shit.

525
00:40:31,665 --> 00:40:33,166
What did I do?

526
00:40:33,167 --> 00:40:33,916
We should go.

527
00:40:33,917 --> 00:40:36,312
We can just make
it before daylight.

528
00:40:41,299 --> 00:40:43,467
Sneaking in here like this.

529
00:40:43,468 --> 00:40:45,010
What are we in for here?

530
00:40:45,011 --> 00:40:47,511
Folks will want to be
left to their own way.

531
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:49,678
They don't like strangers.

532
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:50,930
You're not a stranger.

533
00:40:50,931 --> 00:40:53,473
Oh some think of me
as worse I'm sure.

534
00:40:53,475 --> 00:40:54,766
Especially now.

535
00:40:54,767 --> 00:41:00,021
You see an unusual number of strangers have
been landing on Plum the last few weeks.

536
00:41:00,022 --> 00:41:01,814
On boats they got from me.

537
00:41:01,815 --> 00:41:04,066
Your pitch on the net
why did you do it?

538
00:41:04,067 --> 00:41:07,319
To annoy a certain gentleman
who thinks he owns this rock.

539
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:11,237
And believe it or not, to help people
to find a better place to live.

540
00:41:11,238 --> 00:41:14,116
So what happened between
you and this gentleman?

541
00:41:14,533 --> 00:41:17,284
We had a little disagreement...

542
00:41:17,285 --> 00:41:22,394
...about whether or not to
expand the island cemetery.

543
00:41:29,586 --> 00:41:31,086
Pussyfoot.

544
00:41:31,087 --> 00:41:33,881
Hey, I'm keeping up
with you old man.

545
00:41:33,882 --> 00:41:35,841
No not you, that's
the name of the River.

546
00:41:35,842 --> 00:41:38,634
Pussyfoot cause it's a
pussy of a river.

547
00:41:38,635 --> 00:41:41,345
This side has always
belonged to the O'Flynn's.

548
00:41:41,346 --> 00:41:42,804
The other side...

549
00:41:42,805 --> 00:41:47,309
...Well, I'm sure you be meeting
some folks from the other side... soon.

550
00:41:49,936 --> 00:41:53,022
This here's the back
way over to my spread.

551
00:41:53,147 --> 00:41:55,066
I'm hoping my
daughter will be there.

552
00:41:55,067 --> 00:41:59,359
I had a bit of a disagreement
with her before we left.

553
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,194
But she's still an O'Flynn.

554
00:42:01,195 --> 00:42:04,155
It seems like you been having
disagreements with everybody.

555
00:42:04,156 --> 00:42:05,781
Hey.

556
00:42:05,782 --> 00:42:09,412
When a place looks this empty it's
probably not empty at all, right?

557
00:42:10,911 --> 00:42:12,996
See what I mean?

558
00:42:14,746 --> 00:42:16,455
Mailman is all.

559
00:42:16,456 --> 00:42:19,125
There hasn't been
any mail for days.

560
00:42:30,675 --> 00:42:32,656
Look.

561
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:38,745
And over there.

562
00:42:38,974 --> 00:42:40,516
See what happens?

563
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:42,643
Keep them with you, he says.

564
00:42:42,644 --> 00:42:44,854
Except their not really
with yeah are they?

565
00:42:44,855 --> 00:42:46,959
Not when you have
to keep them in chains.

566
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,106
Who's keeping them in chains?

567
00:42:49,107 --> 00:42:51,693
They've seen us give me a gun.

568
00:42:52,568 --> 00:42:55,779
Never could shoot
straight the bastards.

569
00:42:57,489 --> 00:42:58,531
What bastards?

570
00:42:58,532 --> 00:43:01,868
- Who the hell am I shooting at?
- The Muldoons.

571
00:43:05,537 --> 00:43:07,955
I think there is only
one of them out there.

572
00:43:07,956 --> 00:43:09,331
Kenny get down.

573
00:43:09,332 --> 00:43:11,751
Oh, God.

574
00:43:14,836 --> 00:43:15,961
I got 'em.

575
00:43:15,962 --> 00:43:17,964
Crap.

576
00:43:24,385 --> 00:43:28,305
You said you'd never
take a bullet for anybody.

577
00:43:28,847 --> 00:43:31,641
You're just what I
always said you were.

578
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:37,814
A big old bull shitter.
So there.

579
00:43:45,798 --> 00:43:47,737
Kenny.

580
00:43:49,697 --> 00:43:51,365
Hey.

581
00:43:52,616 --> 00:43:54,448
Shit, Kenny.

582
00:43:54,449 --> 00:43:56,618
No, no.

583
00:43:58,787 --> 00:44:01,414
Why did I bring you with me?

584
00:44:02,623 --> 00:44:04,457
I'm so sorry, buddy.

585
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:06,376
I'm sorry.

586
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:10,130
Why did I bring you with me?

587
00:44:10,379 --> 00:44:12,131
Fuck

588
00:44:15,217 --> 00:44:17,634
I had to do it, you know I did.

589
00:44:17,635 --> 00:44:20,179
You fucker.

590
00:44:33,481 --> 00:44:36,482
- She is beautiful.
- She's dead.

591
00:44:36,483 --> 00:44:38,276
She's my daughter.

592
00:44:39,402 --> 00:44:41,069
She's your daughter?

593
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:42,737
She was.

594
00:44:42,738 --> 00:44:45,073
Will you let me up, please?

595
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:56,207
Hey, you okay?

596
00:44:56,208 --> 00:44:59,836
Of course I'm not okay?
I'm shot, for Christ sakes.

597
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:02,878
Given the fact that you've
been shot are you okay?

598
00:45:02,879 --> 00:45:04,504
Yeah, I'll live.

599
00:45:04,505 --> 00:45:05,713
Mother of God.

600
00:45:05,714 --> 00:45:08,008
On me own property.

601
00:45:08,842 --> 00:45:10,886
All of this...

602
00:45:11,345 --> 00:45:13,555
...used to be mine.

603
00:45:14,597 --> 00:45:16,975
The land around us,

604
00:45:17,182 --> 00:45:19,413
the pond below.

605
00:45:20,059 --> 00:45:22,894
And whatever was swimming in it.

606
00:45:23,145 --> 00:45:25,751
Look what's swimming in it now.

607
00:45:27,899 --> 00:45:29,901
There's a lot of them.

608
00:45:35,613 --> 00:45:40,347
These people didn't get chewed
on by deadheads, they've been shot.

609
00:45:42,493 --> 00:45:44,619
Her mother knitted that for her.

610
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,287
She begged me not
to take it from her.

611
00:45:46,288 --> 00:45:49,750
After I robbed her purse
of the last $30 in it.

612
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:53,252
I put her on a boat
to come over here.

613
00:45:55,129 --> 00:45:57,985
I never meant for them to die.

614
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:04,218
Bastard.

615
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:06,594
Shooting the living
and sparing the dead.

616
00:46:06,595 --> 00:46:07,220
That bastard.

617
00:46:07,221 --> 00:46:11,099
What bastard?
Who is this guy?

618
00:46:11,183 --> 00:46:13,142
Seamus Muldoon.

619
00:46:13,143 --> 00:46:16,771
We've been chewing on each other
ever since the schoolyard.

620
00:46:17,188 --> 00:46:19,522
Will one of yeah give me some
more bullets for this gun?

621
00:46:19,523 --> 00:46:20,565
What are you going to do?

622
00:46:20,566 --> 00:46:23,485
I'm going to go shoot
that son of a bitch.

623
00:46:24,985 --> 00:46:27,174
Not if I get there first.

624
00:46:27,529 --> 00:46:29,571
My best friend is
lying there dead.

625
00:46:29,572 --> 00:46:32,032
My shoulder feels
like it's on fire

626
00:46:32,033 --> 00:46:35,451
and there is a bunch of innocent people
that somebody decided to use for fish food.

627
00:46:35,452 --> 00:46:39,748
Now, if this somebody is this Muldoon
guy you have been talking about...

628
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,812
...I want a piece of him.

629
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,833
I knew we would be
on the same side.

630
00:46:44,834 --> 00:46:46,000
Sooner or later.

631
00:46:46,001 --> 00:46:47,960
I'll go round up
some of my kin folk.

632
00:46:47,961 --> 00:46:48,794
We'll go with you.

633
00:46:48,796 --> 00:46:50,588
No, I know all the back ways.

634
00:46:50,589 --> 00:46:53,173
And five might get seen
where one wouldn't.

635
00:46:53,174 --> 00:46:56,385
No there is an old meeting hall
up the road, half a mile.

636
00:46:56,386 --> 00:46:59,470
You wait there; I'll turn up
just after nightfall.

637
00:46:59,471 --> 00:47:01,848
Oh, the bullets.

638
00:47:04,224 --> 00:47:05,974
Let's get our stuff.

639
00:47:05,976 --> 00:47:07,644
Right.

640
00:47:08,436 --> 00:47:10,730
Sorry about your daughter.

641
00:47:10,897 --> 00:47:13,065
Hurry off now.

642
00:47:37,459 --> 00:47:39,169
Seamus.

643
00:47:39,419 --> 00:47:40,465
Lem,

644
00:47:40,466 --> 00:47:45,364
Christ. What are you doing sneaking
up like a coon raiding the garbage?

645
00:47:45,757 --> 00:47:48,301
I wasn't sneaking, Seamus.

646
00:47:48,675 --> 00:47:49,884
Mr. Chuck sent me.

647
00:47:49,885 --> 00:47:52,720
He says it's still no damn good
you got to come have a look.

648
00:47:52,721 --> 00:47:54,821
Sweet Jesus

649
00:47:55,571 --> 00:48:00,441
what's a man got to do get a moments
peace on this God forsaken rock?

650
00:48:20,452 --> 00:48:21,909
Chuck, you in here?

651
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:24,705
Where the fuck else
do you think I'd be?

652
00:48:25,455 --> 00:48:28,706
Lem tells me you are having
some kind a problems in here.

653
00:48:28,707 --> 00:48:32,794
Well yeah, trying to keep these
God damn deadheads from eating me.

654
00:48:36,214 --> 00:48:37,880
So know more than usual.

655
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:39,883
No sir.

656
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:53,060
Not my hat.

657
00:48:57,980 --> 00:48:59,648
Dammit.

658
00:49:05,987 --> 00:49:09,324
No more than usual.

659
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,833
Ain't that old Timothy's boy?

660
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,626
Timothy Scanlon.

661
00:49:24,627 --> 00:49:26,962
How long has he been in there?

662
00:49:28,046 --> 00:49:29,379
This is his third day.

663
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,380
Must be getting hungry by now.

664
00:49:31,381 --> 00:49:33,257
Put your hand near him
and he'll bite it off.

665
00:49:33,258 --> 00:49:36,927
Dumb fucks in the barn chewing on
their hands cause it smells like a man.

666
00:49:36,928 --> 00:49:40,346
But we haven't had a dumb fuck yet
try to take a bite out of that pig.

667
00:49:40,347 --> 00:49:43,851
Well maybe they don't like pig.

668
00:49:46,977 --> 00:49:49,729
Sir, no disrespect but...

669
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:52,484
...we set out trying to
keep these deadheads alive

670
00:49:52,485 --> 00:49:56,359
and lately we been shooting
them down like they is mad dogs.

671
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:59,028
Those that don't show promise.

672
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:01,487
What about those people
over in the marsh?

673
00:50:01,488 --> 00:50:04,741
Strangers, no kin of mine.

674
00:50:05,117 --> 00:50:10,203
Now, we got an obligation to protect
ourselves and what's ours.

675
00:50:10,204 --> 00:50:13,956
- Protect what's yours,
- What's mine is everybody's.

676
00:50:13,957 --> 00:50:18,753
I provide the bread and
butter for people here.

677
00:50:19,461 --> 00:50:23,547
I figure you would be the last person
to question me on that, Chuck.

678
00:50:23,548 --> 00:50:26,883
I took you in when you
was running from the law

679
00:50:26,884 --> 00:50:29,594
I let you work your way
into a place of respect.

680
00:50:29,595 --> 00:50:32,054
I let you work this
ranch like it was yours.

681
00:50:32,055 --> 00:50:33,429
It's not mine.

682
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:35,055
It's not is it?

683
00:50:35,056 --> 00:50:36,973
I mean with everything you've done.

684
00:50:36,974 --> 00:50:41,227
It might seem more than fair when
all I had to do is tend to the livestock.

685
00:50:41,228 --> 00:50:44,522
But that's when the livestock
was livestock.

686
00:50:44,523 --> 00:50:47,649
Are you still on
my payroll, Chuck?

687
00:50:47,651 --> 00:50:50,320
Or are you walking on me?

688
00:50:50,403 --> 00:50:52,447
No one else is hiring.

689
00:50:55,072 --> 00:50:59,575
Lem, bury the Scanlon boy
and bring home the pig.

690
00:50:59,576 --> 00:51:01,451
It will make a tasty supper

691
00:51:01,453 --> 00:51:04,079
and go out with Chuck
rope another deadhead

692
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,581
and not one of those dumb
fucks in your barn either.

693
00:51:06,582 --> 00:51:08,540
Their all dumb fucks.

694
00:51:08,541 --> 00:51:10,917
Man dies and he gets stupid.

695
00:51:10,918 --> 00:51:13,670
Well I got a dead woman in mind.

696
00:51:13,671 --> 00:51:19,626
One that's smart enough to go riding around
this island like she's still got a heartbeat.

697
00:51:20,092 --> 00:51:21,926
You mean Patrick O'Flynn's girl.

698
00:51:21,927 --> 00:51:25,929
We got to get these things to learn
to eat something other than us.

699
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:27,764
She might be the one, Chuck.

700
00:51:27,765 --> 00:51:30,350
She just might be the one.

701
00:51:47,781 --> 00:51:50,408
You were sweet on
her weren't yeah?

702
00:51:51,367 --> 00:51:53,535
Yeah, well it wouldn't
a worked out.

703
00:51:53,536 --> 00:51:56,392
Seems like nothing ever does.

704
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:31,524
Vinyl. Gag me.

705
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:33,983
Hey.

706
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,986
Medicine?

707
00:52:38,361 --> 00:52:40,488
Thanks.

708
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:43,616
I got a needle and thread
you want me to sew that up?

709
00:52:44,075 --> 00:52:46,327
Sewing is woman's works.

710
00:52:47,203 --> 00:52:51,246
- You're an asshole.
- I told you I'm fine?

711
00:52:51,247 --> 00:52:53,332
Stubborn asshole.

712
00:52:53,666 --> 00:52:55,751
Cisco?

713
00:52:59,171 --> 00:53:01,339
Cisco?

714
00:53:15,433 --> 00:53:17,518
Cisco?

715
00:53:23,772 --> 00:53:25,941
Cisco?

716
00:53:34,907 --> 00:53:40,662
Forget low tech,
this place is no tech.

717
00:53:40,703 --> 00:53:42,996
I don't know, man.

718
00:53:43,121 --> 00:53:46,017
I don't know what we got
ourselves into out here.

719
00:53:46,874 --> 00:53:47,707
Dalmatian.

720
00:53:47,708 --> 00:53:48,458
Damnation?

721
00:53:48,459 --> 00:53:50,042
Dalmatian.

722
00:53:50,043 --> 00:53:51,919
Town I was born in.

723
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,007
Way down in the ass
crack of Alabama.

724
00:53:56,381 --> 00:53:58,174
It was small.

725
00:53:58,175 --> 00:54:01,927
Nobody from the outside
ever came sniffing around...

726
00:54:01,928 --> 00:54:07,473
...folks on the inside always wanted to
know your business every minute of the day.

727
00:54:07,474 --> 00:54:10,851
Town was there 6 years before
they decided to call it something.

728
00:54:10,852 --> 00:54:15,896
When they couldn't think of anything better
they named it after the Fire Chiefs dog.

729
00:54:15,897 --> 00:54:18,608
I like small towns but

730
00:54:19,358 --> 00:54:22,443
small towns give
birth to small people.

731
00:54:22,444 --> 00:54:25,635
But you're not a small person.

732
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:29,241
What are you like 6.2", 6.3"?

733
00:54:30,116 --> 00:54:33,826
6.1" last time I measured.

734
00:54:33,827 --> 00:54:36,370
I don't think I'm
full grown yet.

735
00:54:36,371 --> 00:54:38,205
Who knows?

736
00:54:38,206 --> 00:54:41,084
Might even end
up taller than you.

737
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:44,254
You might kid.

738
00:54:46,212 --> 00:54:49,631
Whenever you get
to be full grown.

739
00:55:01,057 --> 00:55:05,853
Whoa, whoa it's me.

740
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:10,480
Cisco, Jesus.

741
00:55:10,481 --> 00:55:12,733
Leave me alone.

742
00:55:17,112 --> 00:55:19,698
- Cisco.
- Leave me alone.

743
00:55:25,827 --> 00:55:29,205
It's beautiful, no?

744
00:55:29,538 --> 00:55:32,164
It is a beautiful place to live.

745
00:55:32,165 --> 00:55:34,626
And to die.

746
00:55:37,044 --> 00:55:40,838
You know what is
happening to me?

747
00:55:40,839 --> 00:55:41,755
Yeah.

748
00:55:41,756 --> 00:55:45,009
Then go back to the others.

749
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:46,863
Tell them I say goodbye.

750
00:55:46,864 --> 00:55:49,158
No way, Cisco.

751
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:54,765
Okay, if you want to watch.

752
00:55:54,766 --> 00:55:56,016
No.

753
00:55:56,017 --> 00:55:58,227
Jesus.

754
00:55:58,811 --> 00:56:00,270
You don't kill yourself.

755
00:56:00,271 --> 00:56:02,021
If you kill yourself,
you burn in hell.

756
00:56:02,022 --> 00:56:04,937
That's one thing your
God doesn't forgive.

757
00:56:04,938 --> 00:56:06,375
Por favor.

758
00:56:08,787 --> 00:56:10,021
Por favor.

759
00:56:14,615 --> 00:56:17,346
Finally did it, Cisco.

760
00:56:19,411 --> 00:56:23,206
Finally changed
my life forever.

761
00:56:30,377 --> 00:56:32,879
I'll never forget you.

762
00:56:39,093 --> 00:56:42,388
- Who the hell are you?
- Who the hell are you?

763
00:56:43,805 --> 00:56:45,305
It doesn't matter much who I am.

764
00:56:45,306 --> 00:56:48,281
There's only one man matters
around here and I got a feeling...

765
00:56:48,282 --> 00:56:49,671
...he's gonna want to meet you.

766
00:56:49,686 --> 00:56:50,767
Lem.

767
00:56:50,768 --> 00:56:51,726
Come on.

768
00:56:51,727 --> 00:56:53,144
No.

769
00:56:53,145 --> 00:56:56,398
No, fuck you.

770
00:57:02,736 --> 00:57:04,571
Are you okay?

771
00:57:06,865 --> 00:57:08,949
I think I need to
check this shoulder out.

772
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:13,037
There's a first aid kit
in that knapsack there.

773
00:57:17,165 --> 00:57:21,207
Oh, shit.
I'm going to pass out.

774
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:25,025
Shit.

775
00:57:25,338 --> 00:57:29,591
Okay..ah... okay.

776
00:57:30,509 --> 00:57:32,782
Fuck.

777
00:57:39,265 --> 00:57:41,183
Okay.

778
00:57:46,354 --> 00:57:48,230
Shit.

779
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:49,857
You forgot your gun.

780
00:57:49,858 --> 00:57:52,732
You're an idiot.

781
00:57:52,733 --> 00:57:55,006
Too loud.

782
00:57:57,689 --> 00:57:59,388
Stupid.

783
00:58:02,272 --> 00:58:03,923
I'm fine.

784
00:58:36,018 --> 00:58:38,124
Oh, Jesus.

785
00:58:42,731 --> 00:58:44,357
Patrick.

786
00:58:44,358 --> 00:58:47,068
I brought William and my boy.

787
00:58:47,402 --> 00:58:51,488
We been putting them down just like you
said we should have done from the start.

788
00:58:51,489 --> 00:58:55,408
My Susan had to
put her down too.

789
00:58:55,409 --> 00:58:57,473
It's been bad.

790
00:58:57,577 --> 00:58:59,933
Thank you for coming.

791
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:05,520
Help!

792
00:59:07,918 --> 00:59:10,254
Bastards.

793
00:59:35,565 --> 00:59:37,211
She's not eating with us?

794
00:59:37,212 --> 00:59:40,025
Women and children
have their place.

795
00:59:40,026 --> 00:59:42,319
Children quiet in their bed...

796
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:44,822
...and women in the kitchen.

797
00:59:44,947 --> 00:59:46,844
Some women might
disagree with that.

798
00:59:46,845 --> 00:59:49,243
How did you get over here?

799
00:59:49,284 --> 00:59:50,304
Boat.

800
00:59:50,305 --> 00:59:52,202
Did you come alone?

801
00:59:52,203 --> 00:59:53,432
Yeah, yeah.

802
00:59:53,433 --> 00:59:55,163
Well, that's funny.

803
00:59:55,164 --> 01:00:00,458
Because two of my ranch hands were over at
the other side of Pussyfoot this morning.

804
01:00:00,459 --> 01:00:03,191
Only one come back.

805
01:00:03,201 --> 01:00:06,212
Told me he got into
a bit of fracas with...

806
01:00:06,213 --> 01:00:07,672
...6 strangers.

807
01:00:07,673 --> 01:00:08,475
One was a kid,

808
01:00:08,476 --> 01:00:10,570
4 were dressed like you

809
01:00:10,571 --> 01:00:16,097
number 6 was Patrick O'Flynn.

810
01:00:20,684 --> 01:00:26,684
I'm sure the old bastard filled your head with
all sorts of bad thoughts about me and mine.

811
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:31,901
Well, I was born a Muldoon.

812
01:00:32,818 --> 01:00:36,779
At school, my teacher
was a Muldoon.

813
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:39,906
The good man who taught
me ranching was a Muldoon.

814
01:00:39,907 --> 01:00:43,950
My priest, I was named after
him, Father Seamus Muldoon.

815
01:00:43,951 --> 01:00:48,600
You might notice that all the folks
in these pictures look a bit poorly.

816
01:00:48,601 --> 01:00:53,084
That's because all the pictures
were taken after they died.

817
01:00:53,085 --> 01:00:57,295
We felt the need
to keep them with us.

818
01:00:57,296 --> 01:01:00,757
Just like I'm trying to do now.

819
01:01:01,132 --> 01:01:06,010
Those that have fallen all of
them, all I'm praying for...

820
01:01:06,011 --> 01:01:09,806
...is to keep them with us.

821
01:01:10,932 --> 01:01:12,993
All my life

822
01:01:12,994 --> 01:01:17,148
I stuck to the
Good Lord's word.

823
01:01:18,104 --> 01:01:21,482
To his... his practices.

824
01:01:24,692 --> 01:01:30,406
All I'm doing is
what he commanded of us.

825
01:01:51,254 --> 01:01:55,925
I'm going to try
to convince you...

826
01:01:56,551 --> 01:02:00,367
to help me to do
the Lord's bidding.

827
01:02:34,664 --> 01:02:37,834
All right, it's all right.

828
01:02:38,458 --> 01:02:41,168
I got you, I got you.

829
01:02:41,169 --> 01:02:42,377
Come here.

830
01:02:42,378 --> 01:02:43,587
It's all right.

831
01:02:43,588 --> 01:02:45,047
It's all right, baby.

832
01:02:45,048 --> 01:02:46,883
All right.

833
01:02:48,049 --> 01:02:49,424
It's me, Jenny.

834
01:02:49,425 --> 01:02:51,177
It's me.

835
01:02:52,761 --> 01:02:54,554
It's me.

836
01:02:56,848 --> 01:02:57,973
Boys!

837
01:02:57,974 --> 01:03:00,183
Boys, get her out of here.

838
01:03:00,184 --> 01:03:02,436
Get her out of here.

839
01:03:11,025 --> 01:03:14,111
You're dreaming.

840
01:03:16,864 --> 01:03:19,449
Wake up.

841
01:03:20,242 --> 01:03:23,807
I'm sorry, she's.

842
01:03:24,078 --> 01:03:26,935
You need to wake up.

843
01:03:27,998 --> 01:03:30,562
There's two of them.

844
01:03:31,083 --> 01:03:34,044
I have a twin sister.

845
01:03:34,419 --> 01:03:39,673
Janet and Jane, the two Janes they used to
call us no one could ever tell us apart.

846
01:03:39,674 --> 01:03:44,636
Of course it should be
easier now that Jane is dead.

847
01:03:48,264 --> 01:03:50,180
And where is he now?

848
01:03:50,181 --> 01:03:51,097
My father.

849
01:03:51,098 --> 01:03:52,515
He took off.

850
01:03:52,516 --> 01:03:53,704
A while ago.

851
01:03:53,705 --> 01:03:55,268
To do what?

852
01:03:55,269 --> 01:03:56,915
To round up some more O'Flynn's.

853
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:59,168
Lord save us.

854
01:04:01,857 --> 01:04:03,420
What happened to
Cisco and a Tomboy?

855
01:04:03,421 --> 01:04:04,483
Don't know.

856
01:04:04,484 --> 01:04:05,818
I haven't seen them since...

857
01:04:05,819 --> 01:04:08,466
My father is a liar.

858
01:04:08,467 --> 01:04:10,323
Maybe not a liar.

859
01:04:10,324 --> 01:04:14,700
But my father sees the world one
way only and so does Seamus Muldoon.

860
01:04:14,701 --> 01:04:18,702
Both of them about as spite full a
pair of fools as the Lord ever made.

861
01:04:18,703 --> 01:04:20,871
Well, I'm siding
with your old man.

862
01:04:20,872 --> 01:04:22,707
Why?

863
01:04:23,249 --> 01:04:25,041
I got my reasons,

864
01:04:25,043 --> 01:04:26,751
you got one too?

865
01:04:26,752 --> 01:04:28,336
- What reason?
- He's your father.

866
01:04:28,337 --> 01:04:31,630
Never, he was never
a proper father

867
01:04:31,631 --> 01:04:35,447
and now he's back and with
you and your guns with him

868
01:04:35,448 --> 01:04:37,413
and he is about to
start World War III.

869
01:04:37,443 --> 01:04:39,945
Hello, daughter.

870
01:04:40,596 --> 01:04:42,221
Hello, Dad.

871
01:04:42,223 --> 01:04:44,766
You don't have to come with us.

872
01:04:45,267 --> 01:04:47,519
It's never been your fight.

873
01:04:51,979 --> 01:04:53,104
Let's go.

874
01:04:53,105 --> 01:04:53,980
Right now?

875
01:04:53,981 --> 01:04:55,356
Right now.

876
01:04:55,357 --> 01:04:58,526
- We're waiting for Cisco.
- And Tomboy.

877
01:04:58,527 --> 01:05:00,444
Muldoon's got her.

878
01:05:00,445 --> 01:05:04,741
Can't be sure but it's a good bet
his got that Mexican fellow too.

879
01:05:05,116 --> 01:05:07,741
Are you sure you're
okay to do this?

880
01:05:07,742 --> 01:05:12,184
Done worse and done
more kid, let's go.

881
01:05:12,871 --> 01:05:14,539
Dad.

882
01:05:15,665 --> 01:05:18,166
She's really a babe, huh?

883
01:05:18,167 --> 01:05:19,542
You're too young
and I'm too old.

884
01:05:19,544 --> 01:05:21,377
She's got issues, kid.

885
01:05:21,378 --> 01:05:23,462
- We'll see.
- Dad, please.

886
01:05:23,463 --> 01:05:24,463
Go back Janet.

887
01:05:24,464 --> 01:05:27,423
You can't kill him. He is the only
reason why you are still alive.

888
01:05:27,425 --> 01:05:29,426
What?

889
01:05:29,635 --> 01:05:32,512
I'll catch up with you. James.

890
01:05:44,229 --> 01:05:46,313
I always wondered.

891
01:05:46,314 --> 01:05:49,097
Why he didn't shoot me that
night when he had the chance?

892
01:05:49,098 --> 01:05:50,317
It was you.

893
01:05:50,318 --> 01:05:51,777
You talked him out of it.

894
01:05:51,778 --> 01:05:53,737
And for what?

895
01:05:53,738 --> 01:05:57,071
Now, you're going to die
anyway and so is he.

896
01:05:57,072 --> 01:06:02,201
Seamus Muldoon is spit on the
floor that needs to be mopped up.

897
01:06:02,202 --> 01:06:06,246
I mopped your spit off the
floor a hundred times.

898
01:06:06,247 --> 01:06:09,749
And I dug the furrows and
I chopped the wood and I...

899
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:14,836
I buried your wife when
you were nowhere to be seen.

900
01:06:14,837 --> 01:06:21,090
And all the while it was Jane; always
Jane was the one that was in your heart.

901
01:06:21,091 --> 01:06:26,996
She and you were the only children
in the house and me the only grown up.

902
01:06:27,097 --> 01:06:32,516
Listen to yourself; you're
stubborn and willful as I am.

903
01:06:32,517 --> 01:06:35,102
Of course I loved Jane.

904
01:06:35,103 --> 01:06:37,561
But I loved you just as much.

905
01:06:37,562 --> 01:06:42,692
Or more, because
you were another me.

906
01:06:44,277 --> 01:06:45,777
Back to the house, Janet.

907
01:06:45,778 --> 01:06:50,095
See you there later, or not.

908
01:07:03,876 --> 01:07:07,460
What are we stopping here for?
Let's cross the bridge.

909
01:07:07,461 --> 01:07:09,462
I got a feeling.

910
01:07:09,463 --> 01:07:13,008
We should be crossing the old
Pussyfoot somewhere else.

911
01:07:13,967 --> 01:07:17,595
You're going to cross
right here, Patrick.

912
01:07:18,845 --> 01:07:19,970
Get out of here, kid.

913
01:07:19,971 --> 01:07:24,621
Go back to the boat, take the
money out of the safe and go live.

914
01:07:27,727 --> 01:07:30,501
Looking for this?

915
01:07:31,564 --> 01:07:34,504
Now, get out of here.

916
01:07:51,330 --> 01:07:53,247
Don't be shooting them, boys.

917
01:07:53,248 --> 01:07:57,416
They get shot, they drop
that pole and she's meat.

918
01:07:57,417 --> 01:08:00,086
I'll pop the deadheads then
we can pop the rest of them.

919
01:08:00,087 --> 01:08:02,879
Yeah and Muldoon
pops your friend.

920
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,380
No.

921
01:08:04,381 --> 01:08:06,842
I owe something to that girl.

922
01:08:11,595 --> 01:08:14,618
Lay down your guns, boys.

923
01:08:20,478 --> 01:08:23,251
You're lucky I'm me.

924
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:25,564
Come across the bridge.

925
01:08:25,565 --> 01:08:29,985
All of you.
Leave your guns behind.

926
01:08:39,409 --> 01:08:42,746
Bring them all
to Chuck's place.

927
01:09:00,301 --> 01:09:01,884
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah.

928
01:09:01,885 --> 01:09:06,011
- Where's Cisco?
- He's in Heaven.

929
01:09:06,012 --> 01:09:08,180
Telling the Virgin Mary
he can change her life.

930
01:09:08,181 --> 01:09:10,223
This might interest
you. Patrick.

931
01:09:10,225 --> 01:09:12,727
Look in the corral there.

932
01:09:16,355 --> 01:09:19,522
We tried this with
a lot of the deadheads.

933
01:09:19,523 --> 01:09:20,440
Dear Lord.

934
01:09:20,441 --> 01:09:23,776
We tried to feed them
rabbits, squirrels, pigs.

935
01:09:23,777 --> 01:09:26,820
This time we're gonna
try something bigger.

936
01:09:26,821 --> 01:09:29,489
Since it's your Jane
in there, Patrick

937
01:09:29,490 --> 01:09:31,324
I figure you might better
understand what

938
01:09:31,325 --> 01:09:33,659
I've been trying to do.

939
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:36,244
Trying to keep
the fallen with us.

940
01:09:36,245 --> 01:09:41,874
Can't ever do that unless we can get
them to eat something that ain't human.

941
01:09:41,875 --> 01:09:43,459
It's important...

942
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:46,961
...not just for us
but the rest of the world.

943
01:09:46,962 --> 01:09:51,642
God is going to send us all to hell and
the devil will surely send us back again.

944
01:09:51,643 --> 01:09:54,383
If we don't do the right thing.

945
01:09:54,384 --> 01:09:58,303
Chuck, let the others
out of the stables.

946
01:09:58,304 --> 01:10:00,138
Let them see what's going on.

947
01:10:00,139 --> 01:10:03,309
Who knows? Maybe they'll
learn something.

948
01:10:05,227 --> 01:10:07,250
Boys.

949
01:10:12,064 --> 01:10:14,546
Oh, Christ.

950
01:10:27,035 --> 01:10:29,327
I'll make you a deal, Patrick.

951
01:10:29,328 --> 01:10:32,256
If your daughter here takes
a bite out of that animal.

952
01:10:32,258 --> 01:10:34,915
You'll admit that I've
been right all along.

953
01:10:34,916 --> 01:10:36,750
That's all I ever wanted.

954
01:10:36,751 --> 01:10:39,836
It's for you to
admit that I'm right...

955
01:10:39,837 --> 01:10:41,504
...and you're wrong.

956
01:10:41,505 --> 01:10:47,761
You do that much and you and
your boys here will be free to go.

957
01:10:47,885 --> 01:10:51,013
Thanks for the offer, Seamus,

958
01:10:51,512 --> 01:10:54,161
but see I can't go.

959
01:10:54,557 --> 01:10:57,517
Not with business undone.

960
01:10:57,518 --> 01:10:58,808
What business?

961
01:10:58,809 --> 01:11:00,706
Well, for one thing...

962
01:11:00,707 --> 01:11:03,835
...I ain't killed you yet.

963
01:11:05,023 --> 01:11:07,734
I'm gonna play dead a
little differently.

964
01:11:08,026 --> 01:11:09,776
Well, then.

965
01:11:09,777 --> 01:11:13,477
We'll just settle in here

966
01:11:14,736 --> 01:11:16,771
and see what happens.

967
01:11:54,937 --> 01:11:58,523
What would you do with
one million dollars?

968
01:12:15,578 --> 01:12:19,999
My sister is never gonna
do nothing to hurt that horse.

969
01:12:25,461 --> 01:12:27,128
What can we do?

970
01:12:27,129 --> 01:12:30,340
I brought that up
from where you left it.

971
01:12:30,341 --> 01:12:32,258
Thought you didn't
want to start a war.

972
01:12:32,259 --> 01:12:36,325
I don't, I'm just
trying to even the odds.

973
01:12:36,679 --> 01:12:38,679
What's going on up there?

974
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:41,245
It's me, Chuck.

975
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:48,270
I've brought them
back the guns.

976
01:12:48,271 --> 01:12:50,022
Well did you now?

977
01:12:50,023 --> 01:12:52,733
Now, you all have guns.

978
01:12:52,734 --> 01:12:56,005
First one to pull the trigger is
gonna cause a whole lotta bleeding.

979
01:12:56,006 --> 01:12:58,319
- Likely so.
- Let them go.

980
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:59,988
No.

981
01:13:00,530 --> 01:13:02,782
I won't go.

982
01:13:03,324 --> 01:13:08,078
Seems like your daddy is bound and
determined to stick it to me.

983
01:13:08,079 --> 01:13:11,789
Just like I'm bound and
determined to stick it to him.

984
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:13,915
You won't be sticking
it to anybody

985
01:13:13,916 --> 01:13:16,627
not when we're
through with ya.

986
01:13:24,675 --> 01:13:26,509
Hey.

987
01:13:26,510 --> 01:13:30,386
All you guys got are a bunch
of rusty old pea shooters.

988
01:13:30,387 --> 01:13:32,639
Well we got this.

989
01:13:33,724 --> 01:13:35,433
Fuck.

990
01:13:37,017 --> 01:13:41,021
Well, Mr. Muldoon.

991
01:13:42,063 --> 01:13:45,629
Looks like someone
else is hiring.

992
01:13:47,525 --> 01:13:49,673
Chuck.

993
01:13:50,153 --> 01:13:52,779
Chuck, where the
hell are you going?

994
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:56,012
Nobody walks out on me.

995
01:14:03,496 --> 01:14:05,706
Like she wants something.

996
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:08,000
Me.

997
01:14:08,542 --> 01:14:10,899
She knows me.

998
01:14:12,629 --> 01:14:14,819
Jane.

999
01:14:34,272 --> 01:14:36,524
You bitch.

1000
01:14:36,648 --> 01:14:40,401
You fucking bitch.

1001
01:14:56,121 --> 01:14:58,707
I've been bit, Dad.

1002
01:14:58,749 --> 01:15:01,710
This is all your
doing, Muldoon.

1003
01:15:03,836 --> 01:15:06,859
Take cover you stupid fuck.

1004
01:15:09,591 --> 01:15:11,551
Go, go, go.

1005
01:15:21,391 --> 01:15:23,267
You can stop this.

1006
01:15:23,268 --> 01:15:25,812
You can stop it right now.

1007
01:15:27,479 --> 01:15:29,525
Not a chance in the world.

1008
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:43,449
Come and get me.

1009
01:15:43,450 --> 01:15:45,242
Come and get me.

1010
01:15:45,243 --> 01:15:46,910
This way.

1011
01:15:46,911 --> 01:15:48,620
Over this way.

1012
01:15:48,621 --> 01:15:51,498
Guess who's coming
to dinner, Muldoon.

1013
01:15:57,670 --> 01:15:59,881
Son of a bitch.

1014
01:16:18,770 --> 01:16:21,022
Come on.

1015
01:16:23,648 --> 01:16:26,442
Here's your last
shot, Muldoon.

1016
01:16:31,238 --> 01:16:33,573
Let's get out of here boys.

1017
01:19:05,609 --> 01:19:08,236
Come out you skunk.

1018
01:19:09,070 --> 01:19:10,821
I've got one bullet
left, Muldoon.

1019
01:19:10,822 --> 01:19:14,179
Come out so I
can give it to you.

1020
01:19:21,663 --> 01:19:23,956
I've got one left too.

1021
01:19:23,957 --> 01:19:26,125
Say you was wrong.

1022
01:19:26,209 --> 01:19:28,543
Say you was wrong and
I've been right all along.

1023
01:19:28,544 --> 01:19:30,128
Right?

1024
01:19:30,129 --> 01:19:33,463
Does any of this look
right to you, Seamus?

1025
01:19:33,464 --> 01:19:35,508
Dad.

1026
01:19:36,217 --> 01:19:39,490
I've seen everything
die around me.

1027
01:19:39,677 --> 01:19:41,720
Now, I'm dying.

1028
01:19:43,347 --> 01:19:46,704
I don't want to think
of you as dead too.

1029
01:19:50,729 --> 01:19:52,740
Seamus,

1030
01:19:53,563 --> 01:19:58,413
I'll go so far as to say I have
seen the error of my ways.

1031
01:19:58,650 --> 01:20:03,926
Now, if you we'll excuse me, I'd like
to spend a moment with my daughter.

1032
01:20:08,117 --> 01:20:10,202
No.

1033
01:20:11,704 --> 01:20:13,914
You bastard, Muldoon.

1034
01:20:48,189 --> 01:20:49,983
It's over.

1035
01:20:54,153 --> 01:20:55,612
Let's go.

1036
01:20:55,613 --> 01:20:57,281
Move.

1037
01:21:15,921 --> 01:21:18,277
She did it.

1038
01:21:40,355 --> 01:21:43,191
One shot left.

1039
01:21:46,611 --> 01:21:50,614
Wait, wait.

1040
01:21:50,990 --> 01:21:52,825
It happened.

1041
01:21:53,074 --> 01:21:54,699
What happened?

1042
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:57,265
My sister, she...

1043
01:22:02,248 --> 01:22:04,999
She said I wasn't
strict enough.

1044
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,753
To shoot one of my own.

1045
01:22:09,087 --> 01:22:10,461
I did it.

1046
01:22:10,462 --> 01:22:12,588
Didn't I?

1047
01:22:12,589 --> 01:22:16,675
- You okay?
- Right as rain.

1048
01:22:16,676 --> 01:22:19,345
Good luck to ya.

1049
01:22:23,306 --> 01:22:24,974
Let's go.

1050
01:22:29,352 --> 01:22:31,896
Here's a boat.

1051
01:22:39,028 --> 01:22:40,403
Look.

1052
01:22:40,404 --> 01:22:42,841
There's a world out there
and there's money out there.

1053
01:22:42,842 --> 01:22:45,218
The reason we came
out here is because

1054
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:48,658
we'd thought it would
better than any place else.

1055
01:22:48,659 --> 01:22:50,076
Still could be.

1056
01:22:50,077 --> 01:22:53,329
What makes you think we won't
turn out like these assholes?

1057
01:22:53,330 --> 01:22:55,498
Yeah, who knows?

1058
01:22:55,499 --> 01:22:58,333
You and me might end up shooting
at each other one of these days.

1059
01:22:58,334 --> 01:23:03,360
Yeah we might kid if either one
of us ends up being full grown.

1060
01:23:10,385 --> 01:23:12,260
<i>I was on the Flynn
side from the beginning.</i>

1061
01:23:12,262 --> 01:23:16,161
<i>So I just saw Muldoon
as the enemy.</i>

1062
01:23:17,557 --> 01:23:20,393
<i>But I always wondered.</i>

1063
01:23:25,063 --> 01:23:27,940
<i>We decided to take
the money and run.</i>

1064
01:23:28,357 --> 01:23:30,734
<i>Still I wondered.</i>

1065
01:23:31,026 --> 01:23:35,259
<i>What if we could teach the dead
to eat something that wasn't us?</i>

1066
01:23:35,613 --> 01:23:37,906
<i>What if Muldoon was right?</i>

1067
01:23:39,992 --> 01:23:42,515
<i>I guess we'll never know.</i>

1068
01:24:00,633 --> 01:24:02,425
<i>In an us versus them world,</i>

1069
01:24:02,426 --> 01:24:07,970
<i>someone puts up a flag, another
person tears it down and put's up his own.</i>

1070
01:24:07,971 --> 01:24:11,619
<i>Pretty soon no one remembers what
started the war in the first place</i>

1071
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:16,374
<i>and the fighting becomes
all about those stupid flags.</i>
