1
00:00:23,603 --> 00:00:25,161
No one is allowed
into the palace,

2
00:00:25,405 --> 00:00:27,066
by order of the captain
of the imperial guards.

3
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:29,403
Do you not know who this is?

4
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,535
This is Military
Envoy Jang Bogo. Stand back!

5
00:00:33,246 --> 00:00:36,545
We can't let you pass
without orders from the captain.

6
00:00:38,618 --> 00:00:39,414
Stand back!

7
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:53,825
We have blockaded the palace.

8
00:00:54,401 --> 00:00:57,893
Do not let anyone into
the palace without orders from me.

9
00:00:59,573 --> 00:01:01,507
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

10
00:01:08,115 --> 00:01:08,945
Captain.

11
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:11,348
What is it?

12
00:01:11,785 --> 00:01:13,685
Military Envoy
Jang Bogo is here.

13
00:01:21,995 --> 00:01:22,757
What happened?

14
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,391
His Majesty seemed well
when I had an audience with him.

15
00:01:25,565 --> 00:01:27,328
What was the cause
of his sudden death?

16
00:01:27,634 --> 00:01:28,726
We do not know the cause.

17
00:02:08,241 --> 00:02:09,003
Your Majesty...

18
00:02:20,787 --> 00:02:25,315
Your Majesty...
it is I, Jang Bogo...

19
00:02:27,727 --> 00:02:31,163
How could you have
left us so suddenly

20
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,767
before realizing
your grand cause?

21
00:02:36,937 --> 00:02:38,495
Your Majesty...

22
00:02:40,607 --> 00:02:41,835
Your Majesty.

23
00:02:42,876 --> 00:02:44,002
Your Majesty!

24
00:02:48,515 --> 00:02:50,608
Your Majesty...

25
00:02:51,117 --> 00:02:52,846
Your Majesty!

26
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:06,060
Your Majesty...

27
00:03:13,406 --> 00:03:15,431
What are you saying?

28
00:03:22,215 --> 00:03:25,378
You must be mistaken.

29
00:03:27,387 --> 00:03:29,787
He seemed to be in good
health when I last saw him.

30
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,885
It can't be...
it can't be.

31
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:09,694
The arrow has
already left the bow.

32
00:04:11,398 --> 00:04:14,663
No conflict or hesitation
will be tolerated.

33
00:04:16,202 --> 00:04:18,227
Unless the arrow
hits the target,

34
00:04:19,072 --> 00:04:20,505
you and I will
both be finished.

35
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:25,803
I will announce
the king's death,

36
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,576
and prepare for
an imperial funeral.

37
00:04:29,049 --> 00:04:32,109
You must get rid of any evidence
that could cause trouble.

38
00:04:36,256 --> 00:04:37,883
We have seen it
with our own eyes,

39
00:04:38,725 --> 00:04:40,420
but I still can't believe it.

40
00:04:40,994 --> 00:04:42,791
According to
the royal physician,

41
00:04:43,697 --> 00:04:47,258
His Majesty's heart condition
was the cause of death.

42
00:04:48,301 --> 00:04:52,101
But his condition had been
cured during his stay in Chunghae.

43
00:04:53,873 --> 00:04:55,932
He was in perfect health

44
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,043
when I saw him
just a few days ago.

45
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:06,949
You mean there is suspicion
concerning his sudden death?

46
00:05:13,226 --> 00:05:16,855
There are many
questions concerning his death.

47
00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:22,365
We must delay the funeral
and find some answers.

48
00:05:25,171 --> 00:05:27,503
Call a meeting of the captains
of the Kuseo division.

49
00:05:27,974 --> 00:05:28,599
Yes, sir.

50
00:05:43,523 --> 00:05:46,219
- My lord.
- What is it?

51
00:05:46,993 --> 00:05:48,460
Jang Bogo has exercised
his authority as military envoy

52
00:05:48,628 --> 00:05:50,095
and ordered a delay
of the imperial funeral.

53
00:05:51,965 --> 00:05:52,989
What are you saying?

54
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:56,231
He said he'd uncover the truth
behind His Majesty's death.

55
00:06:00,774 --> 00:06:04,540
He has used his authority
to station troops in the palace.

56
00:06:05,412 --> 00:06:08,472
He has also summoned the court
officials to the palace.

57
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:12,249
Who is he to
summon court officials?

58
00:06:12,619 --> 00:06:16,350
He has the authority
as military envoy.

59
00:06:17,957 --> 00:06:22,326
Your failure to kill Jang Bogo
will be shackles that bind us.

60
00:06:40,113 --> 00:06:41,774
What is the purpose
of this meeting?

61
00:06:45,185 --> 00:06:49,451
I wish to delay
His Majesty's funeral.

62
00:06:56,996 --> 00:06:58,224
Delay the funeral?

63
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:00,860
Do you not realize
that stability will return

64
00:07:01,034 --> 00:07:02,592
to the imperial court
only when the funeral is held,

65
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:04,800
and the crown prince
succeeds to the throne?

66
00:07:05,538 --> 00:07:09,872
I can't accept
His Majesty's sudden death.

67
00:07:11,311 --> 00:07:14,280
People will also find
it hard to accept.

68
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,045
We must resolve
any suspicion in order

69
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:21,384
to restore the stability and
authority of the imperial court.

70
00:07:22,222 --> 00:07:23,951
Suspicion?

71
00:07:25,058 --> 00:07:27,219
Are you saying someone
has assassinated the king?

72
00:07:29,062 --> 00:07:30,529
There will be more
commotion among the people

73
00:07:30,597 --> 00:07:31,564
if the funeral is delayed.

74
00:07:32,198 --> 00:07:36,225
Are you able to accept
the sudden death of His Majesty

75
00:07:36,436 --> 00:07:38,904
when he was in good health?

76
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:45,309
I thought you would be
the first to investigate his death.

77
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:54,311
What did you find?

78
00:08:54,948 --> 00:08:56,711
There is no trace of poison.

79
00:08:57,717 --> 00:08:58,877
Inspect the body again.

80
00:08:59,552 --> 00:09:00,917
There would be traces
of poison in his body

81
00:09:01,888 --> 00:09:03,981
if he had been poisoned.

82
00:09:05,325 --> 00:09:08,453
But there are none,
as you can see.

83
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:45,822
Are you still suspicious
of His Majesty's death?

84
00:09:48,434 --> 00:09:50,299
You have let
an unfounded suspicion

85
00:09:50,737 --> 00:09:52,671
delay the imperial funeral and
upset the officials of the court.

86
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,298
How will you take
responsibility for that?

87
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:18,595
A lowly slave summoned
a meeting of the nobles,

88
00:10:19,365 --> 00:10:20,957
and ordered the imperial family
to come and go.

89
00:10:22,201 --> 00:10:25,398
Jang Bogo will soon face
strong hostility from the nobles.

90
00:10:26,205 --> 00:10:27,365
He has dug his own grave.

91
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:32,033
Consul Jang is not
leaving His Majesty's side.

92
00:10:33,346 --> 00:10:36,247
A dead man can't talk.
What is there to worry about?

93
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,178
The royal physician has said

94
00:10:38,518 --> 00:10:41,646
that traces of the poison
will surface after five days.

95
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:45,656
Traces of poison will
surface in three days.

96
00:10:46,292 --> 00:10:47,350
Don't worry.

97
00:10:48,094 --> 00:10:49,823
We just need to hold
the funeral before that.

98
00:10:53,032 --> 00:10:53,999
My lord.

99
00:10:56,769 --> 00:10:57,895
I told you not
to show yourself before me

100
00:10:58,071 --> 00:10:59,538
until the funeral is over.

101
00:11:00,673 --> 00:11:03,141
The military envoy
is not leaving...

102
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:05,439
I know.
I will take care of everything.

103
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:07,507
Put your worries
to rest and leave me.

104
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,285
- Leave me at once!
- Yes, sir.

105
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:23,326
We must silence him.

106
00:12:10,343 --> 00:12:11,173
What brings you here?

107
00:12:13,446 --> 00:12:16,438
I have so many questions,

108
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:21,614
but I am frustrated
to find no answers.

109
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,922
Do you believe His Majesty has
died from his chronic illness?

110
00:12:30,696 --> 00:12:32,493
If His Majesty was murdered,

111
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,357
who do you believe did it?

112
00:12:35,768 --> 00:12:37,065
I know there are many nobles

113
00:12:37,336 --> 00:12:41,432
who oppose His Majesty's
ideas for reform.

114
00:12:43,443 --> 00:12:45,308
I'm certain
they couldn't tolerate

115
00:12:46,512 --> 00:12:48,309
his relationship with me.

116
00:12:48,915 --> 00:12:53,011
You will confront the
imperial family knowing that?

117
00:12:55,388 --> 00:12:58,846
The more you assert yourself,
the more enemies you will make.

118
00:13:02,095 --> 00:13:03,653
It could also
put you in danger.

119
00:13:04,497 --> 00:13:06,294
I can't back down like this.

120
00:13:08,701 --> 00:13:10,225
I must uncover the truth.

121
00:13:15,274 --> 00:13:16,969
You are the captain
of the imperial guards.

122
00:13:18,344 --> 00:13:21,472
You are in a position to know
all the goings-on of the palace.

123
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,545
Just what happened?

124
00:13:30,223 --> 00:13:31,155
Please tell me.

125
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,906
You already know
everything I know.

126
00:13:53,646 --> 00:13:55,170
I know nothing more.

127
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:17,235
I have a few questions regarding
His Majesty's sudden death.

128
00:14:20,072 --> 00:14:21,505
We even performed an autopsy,

129
00:14:22,408 --> 00:14:23,841
but there was
no sign of foul play.

130
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:30,408
I hear that there are poisons
that do not leave traces.

131
00:14:31,884 --> 00:14:33,078
Is that true?

132
00:14:34,453 --> 00:14:36,546
I have heard of an herb
called Chinese foxglove

133
00:14:37,256 --> 00:14:40,157
used by Chinese physicians
that has such properties.

134
00:14:40,793 --> 00:14:42,351
But I have never seen it.

135
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,662
What is this?

136
00:14:51,103 --> 00:14:52,661
I do... not know.

137
00:14:53,206 --> 00:14:54,503
A royal physician doesn't
know the contents

138
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,637
of his own
medicine warehouse?

139
00:14:58,211 --> 00:14:59,576
I will tell you.

140
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,172
It is a poison known
as Chinese foxglove.

141
00:15:02,982 --> 00:15:04,609
When a person is
poisoned with this,

142
00:15:04,984 --> 00:15:07,578
traces of poison will not appear
until five days after death.

143
00:15:09,422 --> 00:15:10,650
Am I wrong?

144
00:15:14,093 --> 00:15:17,790
I predict that traces
of poison will appear

145
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:20,699
in His Majesty's body
in two days.

146
00:15:25,271 --> 00:15:26,397
Who put you up to this?

147
00:15:29,275 --> 00:15:30,469
Who put you up to this?

148
00:15:34,947 --> 00:15:36,039
Who put you up to this?

149
00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:39,149
Please do not kill me.

150
00:15:39,619 --> 00:15:40,551
Who put you up to this?

151
00:15:41,387 --> 00:15:45,983
I was forced
to commit a grave wrong.

152
00:15:46,325 --> 00:15:47,690
Tell me who put you up to this.

153
00:15:48,427 --> 00:15:51,487
Lord Kim Yang and the captain
of the imperial guards.

154
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:30,258
Consul.

155
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,056
What is it?

156
00:17:32,965 --> 00:17:36,230
Master Chang-gyum...
has passed away.

157
00:20:10,723 --> 00:20:12,623
Is it true you're
returning to Chunghae?

158
00:20:14,193 --> 00:20:16,661
Yes.
Get ready.

159
00:20:17,162 --> 00:20:20,598
You will return when there
are unresolved suspicions

160
00:20:20,766 --> 00:20:22,165
regarding the deaths of
His Majesty and Master Chang-gyum?

161
00:20:22,668 --> 00:20:24,533
My presence in the
imperial city is arousing

162
00:20:24,737 --> 00:20:27,399
hostile feelings
in Kim Yang and the nobles.

163
00:20:28,607 --> 00:20:29,904
I will return to Chunghae,

164
00:20:30,676 --> 00:20:36,410
and think about
what I can do for the new king.

165
00:20:36,715 --> 00:20:37,977
There is nothing
to think about.

166
00:20:38,651 --> 00:20:41,779
We could summon our army
and wipe out the nobles.

167
00:20:42,821 --> 00:20:46,552
I know reform is difficult
as long as there are nobles

168
00:20:48,127 --> 00:20:51,119
who have enjoyed
privileges for generations.

169
00:20:52,298 --> 00:20:54,232
But we can't kill them all.

170
00:20:57,102 --> 00:21:00,469
For the sake of the people
who have suffered through wars

171
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,600
and conflict in the court,
we must not cause more trouble.

172
00:21:06,879 --> 00:21:08,176
Be prepared to return.

173
00:21:22,194 --> 00:21:23,525
I don't know
how I will face

174
00:21:24,396 --> 00:21:26,455
Lady Jung-hwa's father
when I die...

175
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,898
...for even Master Chang-gyum
has died such a violent death.

176
00:21:35,574 --> 00:21:38,270
Haven't they found
out who killed him yet?

177
00:21:38,444 --> 00:21:39,240
No.

178
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:47,484
I'm worried sick
about Lady Jung-hwa.

179
00:21:48,587 --> 00:21:51,215
She has lost His Majesty,
who was her pillar of support...

180
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,187
and now Master Chang-gyum...

181
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,887
What a sad fate she has.

182
00:21:59,832 --> 00:22:03,700
I can't stay here.
I must go to the imperial city.

183
00:22:04,203 --> 00:22:06,501
You stay and
take care of business.

184
00:22:07,106 --> 00:22:08,937
I must go and take
care of Lady Jung-hwa.

185
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,873
- There is no need for that.
- What do you mean?

186
00:22:13,078 --> 00:22:15,273
Lady Jung-hwa will
enter the palace

187
00:22:15,381 --> 00:22:16,973
to take care of the young king.

188
00:22:43,642 --> 00:22:44,939
Forgive me for leaving

189
00:22:46,011 --> 00:22:49,310
after placing such a great
burden on your shoulders.

190
00:22:50,182 --> 00:22:51,843
I believe you made
a wise decision

191
00:22:52,184 --> 00:22:55,153
to avoid confrontation
with the nobles now.

192
00:22:57,623 --> 00:22:59,147
I will serve His Majesty.

193
00:23:00,793 --> 00:23:02,886
Put your worries
to rest and return to Chunghae.

194
00:23:03,562 --> 00:23:05,427
If you detect
any danger to His Majesty,

195
00:23:06,965 --> 00:23:08,990
send a message
to Chunghae right away.

196
00:23:10,736 --> 00:23:12,260
I will come back
to the imperial city.

197
00:23:12,738 --> 00:23:16,606
The nobles' and imperial family's
hostility toward you

198
00:23:17,576 --> 00:23:19,168
will grow stronger
in the future.

199
00:23:20,045 --> 00:23:21,273
Please...

200
00:23:25,284 --> 00:23:26,478
Please be safe.

201
00:23:39,164 --> 00:23:39,994
My lady.

202
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:45,193
If I could see...

203
00:23:49,408 --> 00:23:52,241
...you live happily...

204
00:23:56,648 --> 00:23:57,615
I would...

205
00:24:02,488 --> 00:24:04,615
I would have forced
myself to forget you.

206
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,355
When you were going
to be so lonely...

207
00:24:13,198 --> 00:24:14,028
why?

208
00:24:17,469 --> 00:24:19,494
...why did you push me away?

209
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,157
I'm returning
to Chunghae now.

210
00:25:53,665 --> 00:25:56,133
I have a favor to ask
of you before I leave.

211
00:25:59,738 --> 00:26:01,365
Take care of Lady Jung-hwa.

212
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,905
She has lost her brother

213
00:26:08,881 --> 00:26:12,009
even before getting over the
sorrow of the late king's death.

214
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,315
The pain must be unbearable,

215
00:26:19,124 --> 00:26:21,422
but she is not
even crying out loud.

216
00:26:26,665 --> 00:26:29,634
I will find a way to protect
His Majesty when I return,

217
00:26:30,869 --> 00:26:32,530
but I'm thousands
of miles away,

218
00:26:34,106 --> 00:26:36,768
and the power that threatens His
Majesty is in the imperial city.

219
00:26:39,945 --> 00:26:44,314
They will not even allow
Lady Jung-hwa to stay by his side.

220
00:26:47,986 --> 00:26:52,320
You must take
care of Lady Jung-hwa.

221
00:26:55,661 --> 00:26:58,721
Since you have
loved her for many years...

222
00:27:02,801 --> 00:27:04,769
I believe
you will protect her

223
00:27:12,711 --> 00:27:14,804
even without my asking.

224
00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:23,886
- Welcome, Master.
- Yes.

225
00:27:29,528 --> 00:27:32,292
- My lord.
- What are they?

226
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:36,058
It's profit earned
by our merchant group.

227
00:27:37,135 --> 00:27:37,931
Good work.

228
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,895
I don't mean
to toot my own horn,

229
00:27:41,073 --> 00:27:43,007
but the reason I led
such a mediocre life was

230
00:27:43,275 --> 00:27:45,368
because I never had the chance
to apply my talents.

231
00:27:46,645 --> 00:27:51,742
I will repay your kindness
by bringing you large profits.

232
00:27:53,151 --> 00:27:54,550
I will be watching your back.

233
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,281
Build a merchant group
that will surpass Chunghae Base.

234
00:27:58,890 --> 00:27:59,720
Yes, sir.

235
00:28:06,198 --> 00:28:07,028
What is it?

236
00:28:07,499 --> 00:28:09,228
Jang Bogo has
returned to Chunghae.

237
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:29,410
Trading is taking
place without a hitch.

238
00:28:30,188 --> 00:28:31,382
We will soon have to increase
the number of ships to China

239
00:28:31,556 --> 00:28:34,184
to accommodate the increasing
quantity of trade.

240
00:28:36,228 --> 00:28:39,356
Since I have you to run
Chunghae Base in my absence,

241
00:28:39,765 --> 00:28:41,130
I feel most relieved.

242
00:28:43,335 --> 00:28:47,237
Lady Jung-hwa must
be upset over her loss.

243
00:28:49,474 --> 00:28:51,101
Is she well?

244
00:28:52,778 --> 00:28:53,540
Yes.

245
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:56,309
Ill fortune continues
to plague Lady Jung-hwa.

246
00:28:57,616 --> 00:28:59,208
My heart goes out to her.

247
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,286
Consul.

248
00:29:08,894 --> 00:29:11,294
- What happened?
- Everyone is here.

249
00:29:29,448 --> 00:29:32,178
They are middle-class nobles
from all over Shilla

250
00:29:32,384 --> 00:29:33,749
who have answered your summons.

251
00:29:37,956 --> 00:29:38,945
Please be seated.

252
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:47,360
I have asked you here

253
00:29:50,268 --> 00:29:53,431
to recommend you
to His Majesty.

254
00:29:56,675 --> 00:30:00,270
All of you possess
extraordinary talents,

255
00:30:01,046 --> 00:30:03,981
but you have not had
the chance to use them,

256
00:30:04,416 --> 00:30:08,011
and you have lived in rural areas
because of corrupt nobles

257
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,152
or because of the limitations
of your status.

258
00:30:12,357 --> 00:30:18,262
But His Majesty urgently
needs your talents and support.

259
00:30:19,131 --> 00:30:20,723
You must go to
the imperial city,

260
00:30:22,067 --> 00:30:23,364
reform the imperial court,

261
00:30:24,603 --> 00:30:28,903
and put the confusion
in the imperial court to rest.

262
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:31,270
I am sick of politics
in the imperial city.

263
00:30:32,344 --> 00:30:33,606
I do not wish
to go to the imperial city.

264
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:37,071
You can't bring reform
to the imperial court

265
00:30:37,782 --> 00:30:39,010
with your will alone.

266
00:30:40,285 --> 00:30:43,118
The imperial city
will find no peace

267
00:30:44,156 --> 00:30:46,454
unless you wipe out
all the corrupt nobles.

268
00:30:47,859 --> 00:30:52,762
I understand the despair
you must have suffered until now.

269
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:58,864
But if you give up
in the face of reality,

270
00:31:00,772 --> 00:31:02,637
Shilla will come to ruin.

271
00:31:04,976 --> 00:31:07,274
Corrupt nobles who have enjoyed
privileges for generations

272
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:13,183
surround the young king,
indulging in acts of tyranny.

273
00:31:14,786 --> 00:31:18,278
You must go to the imperial
city to protect the king

274
00:31:18,857 --> 00:31:22,293
and support him
so that he may govern wisely.

275
00:31:30,435 --> 00:31:34,098
How many days will it
take to travel to Chunghae Base?

276
00:31:36,007 --> 00:31:39,966
It will be a journey of three
to four days by ship.

277
00:31:42,214 --> 00:31:43,909
Do you wish to
go to Chunghae Base?

278
00:31:47,485 --> 00:31:51,012
There is no place
in Shilla you can't go.

279
00:31:52,557 --> 00:31:55,219
But it wouldn't be too late

280
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,387
to go after you have
become an adult

281
00:31:57,929 --> 00:31:59,920
and restored authority
to the imperial court.

282
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:03,629
The military envoy
is not coming back?

283
00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:07,805
He will come anytime
if you command him.

284
00:32:11,176 --> 00:32:14,168
Your Majesty, it is time
to meet with the court.

285
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:22,543
You must endure it even
if you find it difficult to do.

286
00:32:24,089 --> 00:32:28,856
People can trust you and
follow you when you are strong.

287
00:32:32,097 --> 00:32:33,291
Please be strong.

288
00:32:38,303 --> 00:32:39,463
Escort His Majesty.

289
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:20,039
I'm relieved to have you by
His Majesty's side at all times.

290
00:33:20,979 --> 00:33:22,173
It is my duty.

291
00:33:30,088 --> 00:33:32,147
You have grown frail.

292
00:33:33,825 --> 00:33:36,055
Are you feeling unwell?

293
00:33:37,829 --> 00:33:38,761
No.

294
00:33:44,102 --> 00:33:44,864
My lady.

295
00:33:47,505 --> 00:33:48,529
What is it?

296
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:55,969
If I hadn't met you...

297
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:03,253
...my life would have
taken a very different shape.

298
00:34:07,992 --> 00:34:09,960
You said you wished
me to be happy.

299
00:34:13,665 --> 00:34:14,723
Come to think of it,

300
00:34:17,202 --> 00:34:19,067
the happiest days in my life

301
00:34:20,572 --> 00:34:25,532
were the days
I taught you business in Mujinju.

302
00:34:28,847 --> 00:34:34,752
Back then you learned business
from me without any caution.

303
00:34:37,822 --> 00:34:43,021
Those days seem
like a dream to me.

304
00:34:46,631 --> 00:34:50,123
Since then, you were
always by my side,

305
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,531
but you were also
the farthest from me.

306
00:34:56,574 --> 00:34:58,337
Even when you said
you would marry me...

307
00:34:59,511 --> 00:35:00,705
Even when you said...

308
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,405
you'd stay by my side
in Yi Sa-do's camp,

309
00:35:06,518 --> 00:35:11,285
you were the farthest from me.

310
00:35:16,127 --> 00:35:18,027
You said you wished
me to be happy...

311
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:25,126
You said to forget you...

312
00:35:30,842 --> 00:35:32,935
It is painful
to keep you in my heart...

313
00:35:36,247 --> 00:35:38,010
but because it would
be more painful to forget you,

314
00:35:38,483 --> 00:35:39,848
because I'm afraid
of that pain...

315
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:50,894
I don't believe I'll be able
to forget you until the day I die.

316
00:35:56,568 --> 00:35:57,830
If I should be happy,

317
00:36:00,238 --> 00:36:01,705
it will not be
from forgetting you,

318
00:36:04,509 --> 00:36:06,443
but because my life
of loving you...

319
00:36:09,247 --> 00:36:13,581
will have come to an end.

320
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,580
My lady.

321
00:37:23,855 --> 00:37:24,844
What is it?

322
00:37:25,523 --> 00:37:30,620
Kim Yang is planning to make
his daughter the king's consort.

323
00:37:32,664 --> 00:37:36,760
He has boldly unveiled his
ambition to dominate the court.

324
00:37:39,437 --> 00:37:41,064
If Kim Yang's daughter
should become a consort,

325
00:37:41,406 --> 00:37:42,668
he will become
the king's father-in-law,

326
00:37:43,308 --> 00:37:45,208
and control His Majesty.

327
00:37:46,978 --> 00:37:48,707
I can't just stand
by and watch it happen.

328
00:37:50,181 --> 00:37:52,206
He must be
stopped at all costs.

329
00:37:53,217 --> 00:37:56,209
Must you make your
daughter the king's consort?

330
00:37:57,855 --> 00:37:59,083
It is the imperial family's wish.

331
00:38:00,124 --> 00:38:03,491
They want to use me
to keep Jang Bogo in check.

332
00:38:05,263 --> 00:38:06,594
It is a chance for me
to gain great power

333
00:38:06,764 --> 00:38:08,356
as the king's father-in-law.

334
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,097
I have no reason
to turn it down.

335
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:14,998
If I become the
king's father-in-law,

336
00:38:15,573 --> 00:38:18,167
you will also
gain even more power.

337
00:38:20,244 --> 00:38:24,112
I will give you the power
to slay Jang Bogo in an instant.

338
00:38:27,552 --> 00:38:31,318
Assuming that you are
willing to kill Jang Bogo.

339
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:46,769
Is there bad news?

340
00:38:47,472 --> 00:38:52,671
Kim Yang is trying to make
his daughter the king's consort.

341
00:38:57,281 --> 00:38:59,215
The imperial family and the nobles
are in cahoots with him,

342
00:39:00,618 --> 00:39:05,112
ignoring the king, and
indulging in acts of tyranny.

343
00:39:06,691 --> 00:39:08,352
We must take our army
to the imperial city

344
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:10,083
and slay Kim Yang.

345
00:39:10,728 --> 00:39:12,161
You can't get agitated.

346
00:39:13,131 --> 00:39:16,157
If we raise the army, Lady
Jung-hwa and Master Jo will also

347
00:39:16,934 --> 00:39:19,926
be in danger
along with the king.

348
00:39:21,072 --> 00:39:23,233
It is most regrettable,
but the nobles' tyranny was

349
00:39:25,209 --> 00:39:30,272
to be expected since His Majesty
is of so tender an age.

350
00:39:33,518 --> 00:39:38,148
But for now, it is my duty
to send talented men

351
00:39:38,322 --> 00:39:43,521
who can stay by His Majesty's
side to protect and support him.

352
00:40:03,681 --> 00:40:07,777
Your Majesty, they are men
recommended by the military envoy.

353
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:13,289
They are excellent scholars
who once served in the court,

354
00:40:14,058 --> 00:40:16,891
but have left the court
to avoid conflict there.

355
00:40:17,662 --> 00:40:19,994
But they have returned
to the imperial city to serve you.

356
00:40:20,565 --> 00:40:22,430
If you are recommended
by the military envoy,

357
00:40:24,202 --> 00:40:28,138
I will bestow official posts
on you and keep you nearby.

358
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:30,004
Your grace is immeasurable.

359
00:40:35,213 --> 00:40:38,376
Your Majesty, I heard
that you bestowed official posts

360
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:40,574
on the men sent by Jang Bogo.

361
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:42,483
That's true.

362
00:40:42,887 --> 00:40:45,720
That is not to be!
Please withdraw your command.

363
00:40:46,224 --> 00:40:50,558
It is Jang Bogo's
intention to control the court.

364
00:40:53,231 --> 00:40:55,290
You must ignore his attempt.

365
00:40:55,933 --> 00:40:57,833
They are distinguished scholars

366
00:40:58,669 --> 00:41:00,864
who were already acknowledged
by the imperial court.

367
00:41:02,173 --> 00:41:04,505
What is to keep them
from serving His Majesty?

368
00:41:04,842 --> 00:41:05,638
Silence!

369
00:41:06,511 --> 00:41:09,036
How dare a woman assert
herself in the court?

370
00:41:11,215 --> 00:41:13,240
Your insolence in His Majesty's
presence is unforgivable.

371
00:41:13,684 --> 00:41:16,676
You wench!
Do you have a death wish?

372
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:33,293
Your Majesty, you must not let
Jang Bogo control you any longer.

373
00:41:34,872 --> 00:41:36,100
Please withdraw your command

374
00:41:36,174 --> 00:41:39,371
to bestow official posts on
the men sent by Jang Bogo.

375
00:41:54,992 --> 00:41:56,289
You must go to Chunghae.

376
00:41:57,528 --> 00:41:58,859
Deliver this letter
to Consul Jang.

377
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:03,725
Yes.

378
00:42:04,569 --> 00:42:05,934
You have to be discreet.

379
00:42:06,971 --> 00:42:09,269
Kim Yang's men
mustn't find out.

380
00:42:10,174 --> 00:42:12,301
- Be most careful.
- Yes.

381
00:42:55,219 --> 00:42:55,947
Kill him.

382
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:27,140
You called for me?

383
00:44:27,745 --> 00:44:30,646
I shall go to Chunghae
and draw a clear line

384
00:44:30,715 --> 00:44:33,980
so that Jang Bogo can't interfere
in the politics of the court.

385
00:44:36,354 --> 00:44:37,844
Be prepared
to leave for Chunghae.

386
00:44:40,925 --> 00:44:42,017
I will not go.

387
00:44:45,596 --> 00:44:48,622
I am the captain
of the imperial guards.

388
00:44:49,834 --> 00:44:51,358
My duty is
to protect the king.

389
00:44:55,006 --> 00:44:57,804
Do so,
if that is your wish.

390
00:45:14,425 --> 00:45:16,325
You mean to place
your men in the imperial court

391
00:45:16,727 --> 00:45:18,718
under the guise of recommending
talented young men to the king.

392
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:23,860
It seems it is your intention
to control the king...

393
00:45:25,302 --> 00:45:27,395
- Am I wrong?
- Shut up!

394
00:45:28,672 --> 00:45:30,765
How dare you
utter such nonsense!

395
00:45:31,942 --> 00:45:34,740
Consul, ban this man
from Chunghae at once,

396
00:45:34,912 --> 00:45:36,345
and never give him
the time of day again!

397
00:45:36,781 --> 00:45:37,611
Captain Jung!

398
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,125
So what is this warning
you have for me?

399
00:45:52,029 --> 00:45:56,193
Do not ever
act in haste again.

400
00:45:57,068 --> 00:45:59,161
Since you have
given me a warning,

401
00:46:00,438 --> 00:46:02,303
I will give
you one as well.

402
00:46:05,543 --> 00:46:07,943
I heard you have joined
forces with nobles

403
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:13,414
to oppress the young king
and indulge in acts of tyranny.

404
00:46:15,786 --> 00:46:18,016
The reason I honored
Lord Kim Woo-jing as commander

405
00:46:18,322 --> 00:46:20,756
of the Pyong Dong army, and
marched to the imperial city

406
00:46:22,359 --> 00:46:23,986
was to reform
the corrupt court

407
00:46:25,329 --> 00:46:28,355
and look after
the welfare of Shilla people.

408
00:46:30,234 --> 00:46:31,792
But if you disrupt the court

409
00:46:31,902 --> 00:46:33,494
for the sake
of your personal ambitions,

410
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:41,873
I will not overlook it.

411
00:46:42,279 --> 00:46:47,046
Are you saying you
are willing to go to war?

412
00:46:47,618 --> 00:46:50,143
I have refrained
from raising an army

413
00:46:50,321 --> 00:46:52,687
for the sake of the people
who have already suffered so much.

414
00:46:54,291 --> 00:46:56,521
But if His Majesty's
safety is threatened,

415
00:46:58,629 --> 00:47:01,393
I will take my army
to the imperial city at once.

416
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:40,960
As of this moment,
Chunghae Base is on a war footing.

417
00:47:41,972 --> 00:47:44,941
Captains, inspect
your troops and weapons.

418
00:47:46,443 --> 00:47:48,434
Be ready to
deploy at any time.

419
00:47:48,846 --> 00:47:49,710
Yes, sir.

420
00:48:08,966 --> 00:48:11,400
Unless Jang Bogo ceases
to provoke the imperial court,

421
00:48:13,237 --> 00:48:15,501
we will go
to war with Chunghae Base.

422
00:48:18,475 --> 00:48:20,443
- Captain.
- Yes.

423
00:48:20,844 --> 00:48:22,573
Shut down
the king's private quarters,

424
00:48:23,514 --> 00:48:26,745
and allow no audience
with court officials.

425
00:48:32,056 --> 00:48:34,752
- Chief Jang.
- Yes.

426
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:39,659
Put Jung-hwa and Jo Jang-gil
under house arrest.

427
00:48:40,531 --> 00:48:41,327
Yes, sir.

428
00:48:48,072 --> 00:48:49,630
Let me go, you wretches.

429
00:48:50,407 --> 00:48:54,468
Who sent you here?
Did Kim Yang send you here?

430
00:48:54,678 --> 00:48:55,576
Let go of me.

431
00:50:05,082 --> 00:50:07,915
You must be prepared for
a surprise attack from the enemy.

432
00:50:08,352 --> 00:50:08,875
Yes, sir.

433
00:51:03,707 --> 00:51:04,867
May I have a word with you?

434
00:51:07,077 --> 00:51:07,736
What is it?

435
00:51:08,078 --> 00:51:12,242
I will go to Chunghae
and negotiate with Jang Bogo.

436
00:51:14,451 --> 00:51:16,248
Going to war with Chunghae Base
now is a reckless act

437
00:51:17,654 --> 00:51:20,623
that will not bring any good
to the imperial court

438
00:51:21,592 --> 00:51:23,355
or to the people of Shilla.

439
00:51:25,896 --> 00:51:30,265
I will negotiate
with Jang Bogo, and avoid war.

440
00:51:31,034 --> 00:51:32,934
He will not listen to you.

441
00:51:35,239 --> 00:51:40,404
I will stop this war even
if I have to kill Jang Bogo.

442
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:47,912
How can I trust you?

443
00:51:49,086 --> 00:51:52,681
You have already put aside
your grudge against Jang Bogo.

444
00:51:53,424 --> 00:51:55,324
I am putting my life
at stake by going to Chunghae,

445
00:51:56,527 --> 00:51:59,792
when we are on the brink
of war with Chunghae Base.

446
00:52:01,932 --> 00:52:03,729
If any harm should
come to His Majesty

447
00:52:05,002 --> 00:52:06,936
before I reach an
agreement with Jang Bogo,

448
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:10,506
I will not forgive you.

449
00:52:11,942 --> 00:52:16,470
You're worried about the safety
of Jung-hwa, not the king.

450
00:52:19,917 --> 00:52:25,253
Fine, I can grant you any wish
if you will kill Jang Bogo.

451
00:53:21,512 --> 00:53:26,609
I'm sorry I can't
be of any help to you.

452
00:53:30,754 --> 00:53:32,187
I'm leaving the imperial city.

453
00:53:35,893 --> 00:53:38,384
- Baek-kyung.
- Yes, sir.

454
00:53:39,563 --> 00:53:41,531
You will serve
Lady Jung-hwa from now.

455
00:53:44,568 --> 00:53:46,866
- Yes, sir.
- Leave us.

456
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:01,249
I do not believe
I will see you again.

457
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,153
Where are you going?

458
00:54:12,863 --> 00:54:18,995
It seems I might finally be
freed from my long suffering,

459
00:54:21,638 --> 00:54:23,663
and find happiness.

460
00:54:57,841 --> 00:54:59,741
You said you wished
me to be happy...

461
00:55:02,913 --> 00:55:06,713
You said to forget you...

462
00:55:10,821 --> 00:55:12,914
It is painful
to keep you in my heart...

463
00:55:16,259 --> 00:55:18,056
but because it would
be more painful to forget you,

464
00:55:18,595 --> 00:55:19,755
because I'm afraid
of that pain...

465
00:55:22,432 --> 00:55:30,897
I don't believe I'll be able
to forget you until the day I die.

466
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:37,842
If I should be happy,

467
00:55:40,317 --> 00:55:41,716
it will not be
from forgetting you,

468
00:55:44,488 --> 00:55:46,251
but because my life
of loving you...

469
00:55:49,259 --> 00:55:53,593
will have come to an end.

470
00:56:02,439 --> 00:56:08,469
It seems I might finally be
freed from my long suffering,

471
00:56:11,248 --> 00:56:13,273
and find happiness.

472
00:56:38,308 --> 00:56:40,037
Where has
the head chief gone?

473
00:56:43,246 --> 00:56:44,406
Where has he gone?

474
00:56:47,584 --> 00:56:48,949
He's gone to Chunghae Base.

475
00:56:54,157 --> 00:56:56,853
I must go to Chunghae.
I need your help.

476
00:57:06,636 --> 00:57:10,072
Station the Noh and Kuseo
divisions outside of Chunghae.

477
00:57:12,609 --> 00:57:14,770
You will go to war
with Chunghae Base?

478
00:57:15,078 --> 00:57:16,670
When Yum Jang kills Jang Bogo,

479
00:57:17,414 --> 00:57:22,408
we must take the opportunity
to wipe out Chunghae Base.

480
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:21,372
Let's go.

481
00:58:25,715 --> 00:58:26,682
Who goes there?

482
00:59:22,772 --> 00:59:23,431
Captain.

483
00:59:59,342 --> 01:00:00,172
Consul.

484
01:00:01,511 --> 01:00:03,103
Yum Moon showed up in Chunghae.

485
01:00:26,236 --> 01:00:29,933
Chunghae Base is on the brink
of war with the imperial court.

486
01:00:31,174 --> 01:00:33,472
We can't allow entry to the
captain of the imperial guards.

487
01:00:34,311 --> 01:00:35,039
Leave at once.

488
01:00:35,912 --> 01:00:38,813
I must speak to the consul.

489
01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:41,542
Allow me to see him.

490
01:02:02,565 --> 01:02:03,395
Consul.

491
01:02:05,835 --> 01:02:07,234
Bring Yum Moon.

492
01:02:08,705 --> 01:02:09,603
Consul!

493
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:11,266
Bring him.
