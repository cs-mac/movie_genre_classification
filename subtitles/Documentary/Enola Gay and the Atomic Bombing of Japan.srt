1
00:00:45,382 --> 00:00:50,804
East and West do not
mistrust each other because we're armed.

2
00:00:51,304 --> 00:00:55,183
We're armed because
we mistrust each other.

3
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:56,893
Mr. Gorbachev,

4
00:00:57,185 --> 00:00:59,980
tear down this wall.

5
00:02:10,592 --> 00:02:12,969
James fucking Gasciogne.

6
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:15,013
How did you find me?

7
00:02:15,722 --> 00:02:18,642
Maybe you're not as good at
this spy shit as you think.

8
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,688
It was Satchel, wasn't it?
Satchel gave me up.

9
00:02:28,902 --> 00:02:30,320
I always thought
if I got tagged,

10
00:02:30,403 --> 00:02:32,530
it would be by the best.

11
00:02:32,947 --> 00:02:35,659
But you're not the best,
are you, Bakhtin?

12
00:02:36,826 --> 00:02:39,788
You're the biggest
fucking cunt in the KGB.

13
00:02:42,207 --> 00:02:43,917
Sticks and stones, Jimmy.

14
00:07:12,727 --> 00:07:14,687
That's a nasty black eye.

15
00:07:16,022 --> 00:07:17,148
Where's C?

16
00:07:17,231 --> 00:07:19,108
Given the scale
of recent world events,

17
00:07:19,192 --> 00:07:21,152
C will not be joining us.

18
00:07:24,197 --> 00:07:25,740
Yes, of course.

19
00:07:34,874 --> 00:07:36,793
The voices on record
are the following.

20
00:07:36,876 --> 00:07:40,088
Myself, senior directorate
officer Eric Gray,

21
00:07:40,171 --> 00:07:43,091
our American guest,
Emmett Kurzfeld,

22
00:07:43,174 --> 00:07:44,968
of the U.S.
Central Intelligence Agency,

23
00:07:45,051 --> 00:07:47,762
and returning British operational
officer Lorraine Broughton.

24
00:07:47,845 --> 00:07:49,764
Before we begin, sir,
may I formally request

25
00:07:49,847 --> 00:07:52,392
that Mr. Kurzfeld be removed
from the debriefing.

26
00:07:52,475 --> 00:07:53,685
Request denied.

27
00:07:53,768 --> 00:07:56,145
What I have to tell you, sir,
is not for the CIA to hear.

28
00:07:56,229 --> 00:07:58,481
Lorraine, you are the subject
of this debriefing.

29
00:07:58,564 --> 00:08:00,316
Not its controller.
I understand that.

30
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,276
I was there, in Berlin.

31
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:06,239
And I'm here with the full
executive authority of Langley.

32
00:08:06,864 --> 00:08:08,282
Would it make you
more comfortable?

33
00:08:08,366 --> 00:08:11,160
I could stand behind the
mirror with everybody else.

34
00:08:11,244 --> 00:08:13,496
But it's a little
crowded back there.

35
00:08:16,749 --> 00:08:17,792
Cocksucker.

36
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,252
What did you say?

37
00:08:21,462 --> 00:08:22,630
I didn't say anything.

38
00:08:22,714 --> 00:08:24,173
I'm sorry. Did you say
something, Lorraine?

39
00:08:24,257 --> 00:08:25,800
Did you hear me
say something?

40
00:08:25,883 --> 00:08:26,843
I thought you
said something.

41
00:08:26,926 --> 00:08:29,053
What did she say?

42
00:08:29,137 --> 00:08:30,221
What?

43
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,850
Well...

44
00:08:34,392 --> 00:08:36,894
Do you want to play
the tape back?

45
00:08:44,569 --> 00:08:45,820
Well, then.

46
00:08:48,031 --> 00:08:49,615
Shall we begin?

47
00:08:52,452 --> 00:08:53,828
Berlin.

48
00:08:54,912 --> 00:08:57,672
What happened?
Yeah.

49
00:08:57,957 --> 00:08:59,667
Berlin.

50
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,465
Fuck.

51
00:09:13,973 --> 00:09:15,391
Ah... Lorraine.

52
00:09:15,475 --> 00:09:17,435
Sorry to bring you in
on such short notice.

53
00:09:18,352 --> 00:09:19,896
You know C.

54
00:09:19,979 --> 00:09:20,938
Lorraine; Yes.

55
00:09:21,022 --> 00:09:22,732
We were just
going over your file.

56
00:09:22,815 --> 00:09:24,692
I see your Russian
is excellent.

57
00:09:24,776 --> 00:09:27,236
An expert in
escape and evasion.

58
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,156
Proficient in intelligence
collection and hand-to-hand combat.

59
00:09:31,157 --> 00:09:33,076
It's an impressive
set of skills.

60
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:35,203
And knowing
the reds as I do,

61
00:09:35,286 --> 00:09:37,246
she'll need to use
every damn one of them.

62
00:09:38,331 --> 00:09:40,041
I'll get
straight to the point.

63
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,335
How well do you
know James Gasciogne?

64
00:09:43,336 --> 00:09:44,712
Enough to say hello.

65
00:09:44,796 --> 00:09:46,506
We worked together
in Istanbul in '85.

66
00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:47,590
He's dead.

67
00:09:50,635 --> 00:09:54,097
Gasciogne was killed last
night on a mission in Berlin.

68
00:09:55,014 --> 00:09:58,267
The west German police fished his
body out of the Spree this morning.

69
00:09:58,726 --> 00:10:02,355
And a coroner extracted
a 7.62 Tokarev round

70
00:10:02,438 --> 00:10:03,940
from the base of his skull.

71
00:10:04,023 --> 00:10:05,149
Soviets.

72
00:10:05,233 --> 00:10:10,113
Yesterday, Gasciogne met with a
Stasi officer, code-named Spyglass.

73
00:10:10,196 --> 00:10:12,115
We promised
Spyglass immunity

74
00:10:12,198 --> 00:10:16,119
in exchange for a document on
microfilm, code-named The List.

75
00:10:16,202 --> 00:10:17,954
Hidden in
a Swiss watch, no less.

76
00:10:18,037 --> 00:10:21,374
The list contains every
active clandestine officer,

77
00:10:21,457 --> 00:10:23,126
all their shady deals.

78
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:25,294
It's an atomic bomb
of information

79
00:10:25,378 --> 00:10:28,005
that could extend the cold
war for another 40 years.

80
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:32,093
And we believe the man that
killed Gasciogne now has it.

81
00:10:33,052 --> 00:10:36,305
Our sources point
to Yuri Bakhtin,

82
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:39,976
a KGB hatchet man with more
than a dozen confirmed kills.

83
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,811
So you want me
in Moscow?

84
00:10:41,894 --> 00:10:42,854
No.

85
00:10:42,937 --> 00:10:44,605
Bakhtin never
got on the flight.

86
00:10:44,689 --> 00:10:46,899
So he's still in Berlin
along with The List.

87
00:10:49,402 --> 00:10:50,611
Everyone's
hunting for it.

88
00:10:50,695 --> 00:10:53,239
The yanks, the frogs,
Soviets of course.

89
00:10:53,322 --> 00:10:54,991
And our man,
Percival.

90
00:10:55,074 --> 00:10:56,242
Who's Percival?

91
00:10:56,325 --> 00:10:59,829
David Percival. He's our
number one in Berlin.

92
00:11:01,455 --> 00:11:03,082
He's your point
of contact there.

93
00:11:15,928 --> 00:11:18,723
Straight from
the tit of the Virgin Mary.

94
00:11:36,032 --> 00:11:37,700
The Jordache wasn't easy.

95
00:11:37,783 --> 00:11:39,368
It's for my wife's birthday.

96
00:11:39,452 --> 00:11:42,163
That's really nice. Now,
where's that fucking list?

97
00:11:42,246 --> 00:11:44,582
I gave the microfilm
to Gasciogne last night.

98
00:11:44,665 --> 00:11:46,209
James didn't show up.

99
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:48,544
I did my part.
I gave him The List.

100
00:11:48,628 --> 00:11:50,630
You have to get me
and my family across.

101
00:11:50,713 --> 00:11:52,548
It's not safe
for us anymore here.

102
00:11:52,632 --> 00:11:54,050
The Russians are onto me.

103
00:11:54,133 --> 00:11:55,843
No List, no deal.

104
00:11:57,887 --> 00:11:59,096
I risked everything.

105
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,306
No List, no deal.

106
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:01,766
You listen to me, Spyglass.

107
00:12:01,849 --> 00:12:03,559
Without that list, why
shouldn't I take you outside

108
00:12:03,643 --> 00:12:04,644
and shoot you
in the fucking head?

109
00:12:04,727 --> 00:12:07,313
You are going to kill
a Stasi officer?

110
00:12:07,396 --> 00:12:09,523
One that's about to defect
to the west? Yeah.

111
00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:11,901
Without an embassy
to look after him,

112
00:12:11,984 --> 00:12:14,237
Percival has gone
somewhat native.

113
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,988
Gone fucking feral.

114
00:12:16,364 --> 00:12:17,865
Berlin is the wild west.

115
00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:20,076
And if that bloody wall
comes crashing down,

116
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,327
we don't want
to be under it.

117
00:12:21,827 --> 00:12:25,498
If the Russians get that list,
we're all buggered sideways.

118
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,918
You're Elizabeth Lloyd,

119
00:12:29,001 --> 00:12:30,503
a Cambridge-educated lawyer

120
00:12:30,586 --> 00:12:32,129
sent by James
Gasciogne's family

121
00:12:32,213 --> 00:12:33,422
to retrieve
the body and effects

122
00:12:33,506 --> 00:12:35,383
of their
recently deceased son.

123
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:37,593
Your mission is
to connect with Percival

124
00:12:37,677 --> 00:12:40,054
and do whatever it takes
to get that list home.

125
00:12:40,137 --> 00:12:42,974
And remember, Lorraine,
this is highly sensitive.

126
00:12:43,057 --> 00:12:44,934
Trust no one.

127
00:12:50,856 --> 00:12:52,817
Follow me!
Come, come, come!

128
00:12:54,193 --> 00:12:55,194
Quickly! This way!

129
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:56,445
Tell me you made a copy.

130
00:12:56,529 --> 00:12:57,613
I memorized it.

131
00:12:57,697 --> 00:12:58,656
Memorized it?

132
00:12:58,739 --> 00:12:59,991
Every single agent
on that list?

133
00:13:00,074 --> 00:13:02,201
Every Wednesday, you visit
the Penny Lane Brothel.

134
00:13:02,285 --> 00:13:04,829
Your favorite girl is Margot.
Her real name is Maria.

135
00:13:04,912 --> 00:13:05,955
Maria?

136
00:13:07,164 --> 00:13:08,457
All right,
I'll get you across.

137
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:09,667
You're a good man,
Percival.

138
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,751
Fuck off.

139
00:13:10,835 --> 00:13:12,962
I just want The List.
Once I... oh, fuck!

140
00:13:13,462 --> 00:13:14,714
I will be in touch.

141
00:13:16,173 --> 00:13:17,133
Uh...

142
00:13:19,343 --> 00:13:20,720
Ooh!

143
00:14:41,467 --> 00:14:43,260
I'm so fucking late.

144
00:15:27,012 --> 00:15:29,682
Miss Broughton, Mr.
Percival was running late.

145
00:15:29,765 --> 00:15:31,725
He sent me
to pick you up.

146
00:15:31,809 --> 00:15:33,060
Checked bags?

147
00:15:33,144 --> 00:15:34,520
No, they've been sent.

148
00:15:34,603 --> 00:15:36,355
Please, follow me.

149
00:15:44,238 --> 00:15:45,281
Docking in front

150
00:15:45,364 --> 00:15:46,449
of the terminal
is not permitted.

151
00:15:46,532 --> 00:15:48,784
Passengers loading
and unloading only.

152
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,257
So...

153
00:16:03,549 --> 00:16:05,468
Is this your
first time in Berlin?

154
00:16:05,551 --> 00:16:06,594
Yes.

155
00:16:07,178 --> 00:16:09,138
Well, it's a remarkable
time to be here.

156
00:16:11,182 --> 00:16:14,894
Wonderful music, superb
nightlife, marvelous restaurants.

157
00:16:15,478 --> 00:16:18,481
You must try the central
café for a drink.

158
00:16:18,898 --> 00:16:20,566
You'll need it later.

159
00:16:25,696 --> 00:16:28,491
You remember Mr.
Bremovych, don't you?

160
00:16:32,286 --> 00:16:33,954
Of course, you do.

161
00:16:36,248 --> 00:16:39,001
Well, he's very curious what
you're doing here in Berlin.

162
00:16:46,383 --> 00:16:47,510
What the fuck
are you doing?

163
00:17:22,878 --> 00:17:24,588
What the fuck
are you doing?

164
00:17:42,481 --> 00:17:43,816
Welcome to Berlin.

165
00:17:43,899 --> 00:17:45,025
I'm David...

166
00:17:45,609 --> 00:17:46,944
Where the fuck were you?

167
00:17:47,027 --> 00:17:49,238
Don't shoot.
I've got your shoe.

168
00:17:53,659 --> 00:17:55,619
Let me help you
with your bags.

169
00:17:57,496 --> 00:17:58,539
Come on.

170
00:17:58,998 --> 00:18:00,499
For fuck's sake.

171
00:18:00,749 --> 00:18:02,918
Russians are
fucking heavy.

172
00:18:03,502 --> 00:18:05,588
Five minutes on the
ground and I'm already made.

173
00:18:05,671 --> 00:18:07,339
You're not made. I hope.

174
00:18:07,423 --> 00:18:08,424
They knew my name.

175
00:18:08,507 --> 00:18:09,717
That's troubling.
And yours.

176
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,176
That's hardly surprising.

177
00:18:13,053 --> 00:18:15,681
Great fucking
start, Percival.

178
00:18:23,606 --> 00:18:25,482
So what was
your first impression?

179
00:18:25,566 --> 00:18:28,434
Of David?  - Well...

180
00:18:29,737 --> 00:18:32,364
He was handsome. Late 30s.

181
00:18:34,074 --> 00:18:35,993
Disastrous
Sinéad O'Connor hair.

182
00:18:37,036 --> 00:18:38,662
Irish singer.
Hmm.

183
00:18:38,746 --> 00:18:42,374
I asked him what the deal
was with that, and he said,

184
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,126
"lt's to blend in."

185
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,128
You want to touch it?

186
00:18:46,211 --> 00:18:48,088
It's to blend in
in the east.

187
00:18:53,636 --> 00:18:55,471
That was the Brandenburg Gate,
by the way.

188
00:18:55,554 --> 00:18:57,139
I mean, how the fuck
do the suits think

189
00:18:57,222 --> 00:18:59,308
that you're going to be able
to help me find that list?

190
00:18:59,391 --> 00:19:00,893
As soon as you pick up
Gasciogne's body,

191
00:19:00,976 --> 00:19:02,144
they'll null
and void your visa

192
00:19:02,227 --> 00:19:03,646
and you'll be on
the first flight back home.

193
00:19:03,729 --> 00:19:05,147
I'll figure it out.

194
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,899
That's
Checkpoint Charlie.

195
00:19:06,982 --> 00:19:08,484
My office
is just back there.

196
00:19:08,567 --> 00:19:10,944
I'm not here to collect
postcards, Percival.

197
00:19:11,028 --> 00:19:13,238
Just drop me at my hotel.
It's around the corner.

198
00:19:13,322 --> 00:19:15,658
I thought you said you'd
never been to Berlin before.

199
00:19:15,741 --> 00:19:17,701
I can read a fucking map.

200
00:19:17,785 --> 00:19:19,745
This will
just take a minute.

201
00:19:28,671 --> 00:19:29,838
What are you doing?

202
00:19:29,922 --> 00:19:32,341
Sending
a message to a fascist pig.

203
00:19:37,763 --> 00:19:39,848
Say hello to comrade
Bremovych for me.

204
00:19:54,947 --> 00:19:55,989
Bremovych.

205
00:22:15,921 --> 00:22:18,090
Tensions are
high in east Berlin tonight,

206
00:22:18,173 --> 00:22:20,676
as civil disobedience
continues to build momentum.

207
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:23,262
East Berlin's youth leaders
shout out their protests

208
00:22:23,345 --> 00:22:25,138
through tear gas
and water cannons.

209
00:22:25,222 --> 00:22:26,598
And there are
numerous reports

210
00:22:26,682 --> 00:22:30,102
of police beating peaceful
demonstrators with batons.

211
00:23:02,968 --> 00:23:06,346
I've been sent to arrange
the return of a British subject.

212
00:23:06,805 --> 00:23:09,349
The body was
identified by your attaché.

213
00:23:09,433 --> 00:23:11,101
Yes, I believe so.

214
00:23:11,184 --> 00:23:14,605
This was not a question.
It was a statement.

215
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:22,195
He was your colleague?

216
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:23,697
Different department.

217
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,865
Which department?

218
00:23:24,948 --> 00:23:26,158
A different one.

219
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:30,913
You have the transfer papers?

220
00:23:44,426 --> 00:23:48,347
Do you know those movies where
the picture just starts to slow down,

221
00:23:49,556 --> 00:23:50,849
and melt,

222
00:23:52,017 --> 00:23:54,227
then catch fire?

223
00:23:56,355 --> 00:23:57,606
Well...

224
00:23:59,816 --> 00:24:01,485
That's Berlin.

225
00:24:03,195 --> 00:24:05,405
The passport
number is incorrect.

226
00:24:05,489 --> 00:24:08,116
I will not release this body
without the correct information.

227
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,618
It's a simple mistake.

228
00:24:09,701 --> 00:24:13,163
Ms. Lloyd, in Germany, we
don't make simple mistakes.

229
00:25:08,802 --> 00:25:11,471
I'm not going to lie,
I'm impressed.

230
00:25:12,139 --> 00:25:14,516
You've got some balls
breaking in here.

231
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:16,935
You should see my balls, then
you'd be really impressed.

232
00:25:17,394 --> 00:25:19,563
Hmm... I'll take
your word for it.

233
00:25:19,646 --> 00:25:21,273
I see you found
a way to stay.

234
00:25:21,356 --> 00:25:23,775
You wrote "16" when it
should have said "76."

235
00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:27,029
That's right,
I'm not going anywhere.

236
00:25:27,446 --> 00:25:28,780
I'm here for at least
another week.

237
00:25:28,864 --> 00:25:30,407
Lucky fucking me.

238
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:33,910
They won't release the body now
until they've investigated

239
00:25:33,994 --> 00:25:35,037
that red tape nightmare.

240
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,913
How the fuck
did you get in here?

241
00:25:36,997 --> 00:25:39,207
You know, I've been
in Berlin a long time,

242
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:41,084
and I think I know
every doorman of

243
00:25:41,168 --> 00:25:43,128
every decent shithouse,

244
00:25:43,211 --> 00:25:46,465
borderline decent flophouse,
both sides of the wall.

245
00:25:46,548 --> 00:25:49,051
Well, then you must
know Spyglass.

246
00:25:50,135 --> 00:25:51,803
Never met the fellow.

247
00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:53,847
He was James's.

248
00:25:55,849 --> 00:25:56,933
What do you know
about this woman

249
00:25:57,017 --> 00:26:00,020
who's been following me
since Tempelhof?

250
00:26:01,021 --> 00:26:03,982
I'd say that
you're an attractive woman,

251
00:26:04,566 --> 00:26:06,693
and you should do the math.

252
00:26:08,904 --> 00:26:11,740
You know, if I was to follow
you, I mean, properly,

253
00:26:11,823 --> 00:26:13,033
you'd never fucking know.

254
00:26:14,701 --> 00:26:16,870
There's a knack
to it, isn't there?

255
00:26:17,329 --> 00:26:20,207
It's like walking a tightrope
or playing bagpipes.

256
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:23,043
You can either do it,
or you can't.

257
00:26:25,128 --> 00:26:26,838
Knock yourself out.

258
00:26:52,823 --> 00:26:54,658
I'd like to purchase
a watch.

259
00:26:56,284 --> 00:26:59,704
I need access
to a network in east Berlin.

260
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,543
Come back tomorrow
before closing.

261
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:08,505
East Berlin is on
a short fuse again tonight

262
00:27:08,588 --> 00:27:12,008
as communist party officials
struggle to maintain order.

263
00:27:13,009 --> 00:27:14,970
Gray- How well do you
know James Gasciogne?

264
00:27:15,053 --> 00:27:16,388
He's dead.

265
00:27:16,555 --> 00:27:18,473
You need to be careful.

266
00:27:18,557 --> 00:27:21,726
...7.62 Tokarev round
from the base of his skull.

267
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:22,811
Soviets.

268
00:27:22,894 --> 00:27:24,729
Gray- We know who Satchel is.

269
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,983
You need to run.

270
00:28:38,386 --> 00:28:41,848
You expected to find the
list in Gasciogne's apartment.

271
00:28:41,932 --> 00:28:43,433
You realize you were
late to the party.

272
00:28:44,226 --> 00:28:45,518
Percival, the Russians,

273
00:28:45,602 --> 00:28:48,230
everybody must've already
ransacked the place.

274
00:28:48,313 --> 00:28:49,314
Lorraine; Yes.

275
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,026
But The List
wasn't our only problem.

276
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:57,572
Before I left,
he told me one last thing.

277
00:28:59,908 --> 00:29:03,703
This is exactly why
I didn't want the CIA present.

278
00:29:07,415 --> 00:29:09,751
Spyglass revealed
that this list

279
00:29:09,834 --> 00:29:12,921
would expose a double agent
by the name of Satchel.

280
00:29:14,005 --> 00:29:16,299
I want Satchel,
dead or alive.

281
00:29:17,175 --> 00:29:20,136
This traitor has been a Thorn
in our side for years.

282
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,681
He's a black eye
to the crown.

283
00:29:22,764 --> 00:29:26,351
And the single biggest
intelligence leak in MI6 history.

284
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,771
You expose this bastard,
Satchel,

285
00:29:30,772 --> 00:29:33,024
and we'll hang him
for treason.

286
00:29:33,984 --> 00:29:37,112
You might find yourself taking
tea at Buckingham Palace.

287
00:29:38,196 --> 00:29:42,993
So no, I wasn't just looking for
The List in Gasciogne's apartment.

288
00:30:04,764 --> 00:30:08,852
Percival and I seem to have a
different definition for collaboration.

289
00:30:10,895 --> 00:30:12,939
Gray- What's that
supposed to mean?

290
00:30:13,023 --> 00:30:16,693
He was the only one who knew
I was going to Gasciogne's apartment.

291
00:30:17,569 --> 00:30:19,487
And if I knew he was
going to call the police,

292
00:30:19,571 --> 00:30:21,156
I would have worn
a different outfit.

293
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,582
"Different outfit"?

294
00:32:19,566 --> 00:32:20,608
Hey!

295
00:32:20,692 --> 00:32:21,818
Halt!

296
00:32:50,013 --> 00:32:52,390
With repeated calls
for change on the streets

297
00:32:52,474 --> 00:32:54,809
and the protestors growing
ever more confident,

298
00:32:54,893 --> 00:32:57,645
time is running out for
the east German government.

299
00:32:57,729 --> 00:32:59,105
Popular opinion has it

300
00:32:59,189 --> 00:33:03,067
that the communists' claim to
leadership can't be upheld much longer.

301
00:33:03,151 --> 00:33:05,361
And if rapid change
is not forthcoming,

302
00:33:05,445 --> 00:33:08,281
today's relatively calm
protests could be seen

303
00:33:08,448 --> 00:33:10,617
as the calm before the storm.

304
00:33:11,743 --> 00:33:14,329
It's not just new faces
that are called for,

305
00:33:14,412 --> 00:33:17,916
but perhaps a complete
demolition of the wall.

306
00:33:39,187 --> 00:33:40,188
Hmm?

307
00:33:44,984 --> 00:33:46,861
Let me take your coat.

308
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:56,287
Make yourself at home.

309
00:34:03,795 --> 00:34:05,421
Fucking hell.

310
00:34:07,757 --> 00:34:10,677
Do you want a pair of
jeans? Help yourself.

311
00:34:22,981 --> 00:34:24,023
Hmm.

312
00:34:24,107 --> 00:34:26,526
Your library
includes Larry flynt?

313
00:34:27,735 --> 00:34:29,571
Champion of free speech.

314
00:34:31,155 --> 00:34:32,365
Hmm.

315
00:34:34,492 --> 00:34:36,452
What have you found
on Bakhtin?

316
00:34:36,536 --> 00:34:39,038
Look, if Bakhtin wanted the
Russians to have that list,

317
00:34:39,122 --> 00:34:41,082
he would have given it to them by now.

318
00:34:41,165 --> 00:34:43,876
We just have to wait for him
to make his move.

319
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,253
We can't afford to wait.

320
00:34:45,336 --> 00:34:46,963
This is your city,
Percival.

321
00:34:47,046 --> 00:34:50,466
Or do you only know
doormen and bellhops?

322
00:34:55,388 --> 00:34:57,765
So what did you find
in Gasciogne's apartment?

323
00:34:57,849 --> 00:35:02,687
Some deutsche marks, empty
passports, travel visas.

324
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:06,399
And a picture of the two of you
together a few years back.

325
00:35:10,862 --> 00:35:12,905
Did I not mention
that we were friends?

326
00:35:12,989 --> 00:35:13,990
No.
No?

327
00:35:14,073 --> 00:35:15,992
I must have forgot to.

328
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:22,832
Get your coat, love.

329
00:35:23,124 --> 00:35:25,043
We're going for a walk.

330
00:35:31,799 --> 00:35:34,677
Look, we're all
exposed by that list.

331
00:35:34,761 --> 00:35:36,554
Saving the world
is cool and all that,

332
00:35:36,638 --> 00:35:39,307
but my main objective
is staying alive.

333
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,850
I've been head of Berlin
station for 10 years.

334
00:35:40,933 --> 00:35:42,685
You've got to know that I'm
the only man in this town

335
00:35:42,769 --> 00:35:44,187
that can help you
get that list.

336
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:45,772
Yes, I've read your file.

337
00:35:45,855 --> 00:35:47,732
I've also read
your dog file.

338
00:35:48,232 --> 00:35:50,568
So let's cut the crap,
shall we?

339
00:35:51,069 --> 00:35:53,321
This whole hungover,
show-up-late,

340
00:35:53,404 --> 00:35:54,781
don't-know-which-way-is-up
act?

341
00:35:54,864 --> 00:35:56,532
I'm not buying it.

342
00:35:56,866 --> 00:35:59,744
I trust you about
as far as I can throw you.

343
00:35:59,827 --> 00:36:02,246
"It's a double pleasure
to deceive the deceiver."

344
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,248
Niccolò  Machiavelli.

345
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:07,001
It was on your shelf.

346
00:36:07,085 --> 00:36:09,671
Oh, my god. I think
I fucking love you.

347
00:36:10,129 --> 00:36:11,839
That's too bad.

348
00:36:12,799 --> 00:36:16,052
If Percival was telling
the truth about Bakhtin,

349
00:36:16,761 --> 00:36:20,014
I needed to figure out
what the Russians knew.

350
00:36:57,093 --> 00:36:58,469
Stoli on ice.

351
00:37:26,748 --> 00:37:29,083
I'm not speaking
German tonight.

352
00:37:29,709 --> 00:37:31,210
So, you're British?

353
00:37:36,591 --> 00:37:37,633
Very impressive.

354
00:37:39,677 --> 00:37:42,013
This can't be
your only talent.

355
00:37:43,389 --> 00:37:45,433
Talents can be overrated.

356
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:50,688
A dedication, a loyalty
is very rare these days.

357
00:37:56,861 --> 00:37:59,989
Everyone here is
searching for something.

358
00:38:01,365 --> 00:38:03,367
What are you
looking for?

359
00:38:03,868 --> 00:38:05,453
Well, when all's
said and done,

360
00:38:05,536 --> 00:38:10,416
wouldn't you say deep down, we're all
just searching for the same thing?

361
00:38:17,215 --> 00:38:18,966
I leave you alone
for only a moment

362
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:20,718
and already you are
attracting admirers.

363
00:38:21,761 --> 00:38:26,682
Monsieur, three is not always
a crowd, but tonight it is.

364
00:38:28,059 --> 00:38:29,560
French women.

365
00:38:32,063 --> 00:38:33,731
What about the British?

366
00:38:34,482 --> 00:38:37,568
Maybe we can make
some sort of arrangement.

367
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,322
We haven't seen each other
in a long time.

368
00:38:41,405 --> 00:38:43,741
And we really
need to catch up.

369
00:38:44,909 --> 00:38:46,244
Alone.

370
00:38:47,245 --> 00:38:50,206
Ladies, Berlin
is a small place.

371
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:53,501
I'm sure our paths
will cross again.

372
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:05,721
Sorry.

373
00:39:06,264 --> 00:39:08,766
You looked like
you needed saving.

374
00:39:10,351 --> 00:39:13,104
Well, I appreciate
the gesture, miss...

375
00:39:13,437 --> 00:39:15,940
Lasalle.
Delphine Lasalle.

376
00:39:16,941 --> 00:39:18,734
Pleased to meet you.

377
00:39:20,611 --> 00:39:22,780
So, what do you do,
Delphine?

378
00:39:23,114 --> 00:39:25,908
I'm a part-time translator who
really wants to be a poet.

379
00:39:25,992 --> 00:39:27,743
Maybe a rock star.

380
00:39:32,957 --> 00:39:36,252
My friend owns a club nearby.
Want to come check it out?

381
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,879
Now?
Sure.

382
00:39:39,672 --> 00:39:41,048
I can't.

383
00:39:42,133 --> 00:39:44,802
Well, I'll give you
the address anyway.

384
00:39:45,303 --> 00:39:47,722
Come meet me there
tomorrow night?

385
00:39:50,141 --> 00:39:51,642
Will you come?

386
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:54,020
Maybe?

387
00:39:54,478 --> 00:39:56,147
You're relentless.

388
00:39:57,231 --> 00:39:58,482
Oui.

389
00:40:01,027 --> 00:40:03,154
David Hasselhoff's in town.

390
00:40:03,237 --> 00:40:04,822
Lucky us.

391
00:40:05,615 --> 00:40:07,408
Berlin is truly doomed.

392
00:40:28,429 --> 00:40:30,473
Your watch is ready.

393
00:40:31,182 --> 00:40:34,143
It's on the counter
in that plain envelope.

394
00:40:42,693 --> 00:40:45,613
I think you'll find
my contact very useful.

395
00:40:57,667 --> 00:40:59,669
Your watch is ready.

396
00:41:00,544 --> 00:41:03,464
It's on the counter
in that plain envelope.

397
00:41:04,966 --> 00:41:07,551
I think you'll find
my contact very useful.

398
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:12,139
East Berliners stormed
the west German embassies

399
00:41:12,223 --> 00:41:14,141
in Czechoslovakia
earlier this week,

400
00:41:14,225 --> 00:41:16,978
as the Czech government has
begun to waive the refugees

401
00:41:17,061 --> 00:41:19,230
through checkpoints
with few questions.

402
00:41:19,313 --> 00:41:22,692
One has to ask how long the east
Berlin government can hold on

403
00:41:22,775 --> 00:41:26,195
as the tide of loaded Trabants
continues to flow out.

404
00:41:43,671 --> 00:41:47,091
Bakhtin and The List had
not yet surfaced in the west.

405
00:41:47,967 --> 00:41:49,593
I needed to meet
my new contact

406
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:52,263
and see what I was
up against in the east.

407
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:01,772
You should have applied
for a visitor's permit.

408
00:42:03,649 --> 00:42:05,109
What kind of work
do you do?

409
00:42:05,192 --> 00:42:06,569
Legal affairs.

410
00:42:15,161 --> 00:42:17,538
If you do not
return before 6:00,

411
00:42:17,621 --> 00:42:18,956
you will be arrested.

412
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,207
Do you understand?

413
00:42:21,417 --> 00:42:22,418
I understand.

414
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,845
Right now, I'm not feeling very
confident about this story of yours.

415
00:42:33,888 --> 00:42:37,141
Why not use Percival's
connections in the east?

416
00:42:38,017 --> 00:42:42,271
He told me
to trust no one.

417
00:42:46,317 --> 00:42:47,485
Hello?

418
00:46:52,354 --> 00:46:53,856
You are late.

419
00:46:54,273 --> 00:46:56,191
And you were followed.

420
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,986
I'm late
because I was followed.

421
00:46:59,069 --> 00:47:02,489
I lost them 20 minutes ago
near the Palast der Republik.

422
00:47:02,573 --> 00:47:04,992
You're as good
as your reputation.

423
00:47:05,492 --> 00:47:07,411
Are you sure this
is the best place to meet?

424
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:11,040
Keep your enemies close.

425
00:47:12,082 --> 00:47:14,835
I'm a permanent
fixture for them now.

426
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:19,757
The watchmaker says there has
been great interest in this list

427
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,842
on the black market
the last few days.

428
00:47:21,925 --> 00:47:23,927
Any sign of Bakhtin?
No.

429
00:47:24,762 --> 00:47:28,724
This Satchel character has people
worried on both sides of the wall.

430
00:47:28,807 --> 00:47:29,933
Yeah.

431
00:47:30,768 --> 00:47:32,936
What kind of network
have you assembled?

432
00:47:33,687 --> 00:47:38,442
There's a lot of dissatisfied
youth on this side of the wall.

433
00:47:42,488 --> 00:47:45,949
They're like a tinderbox.

434
00:47:47,451 --> 00:47:50,204
If you find the right spark...

435
00:47:51,955 --> 00:47:53,749
Keep talking.

436
00:48:32,037 --> 00:48:34,540
I am interested
in selling a watch.

437
00:48:34,998 --> 00:48:37,084
What are you selling?

438
00:48:37,626 --> 00:48:39,503
It is extremely valuable.

439
00:48:40,045 --> 00:48:44,299
The finest quality
and filled with secrets.

440
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:55,727
Would you mind if I inspect
the merchandise?

441
00:48:57,938 --> 00:49:00,315
Fuck yes, I mind.

442
00:49:01,567 --> 00:49:06,947
Just tell potential buyers
Bakhtin is open for business.

443
00:49:22,045 --> 00:49:25,090
Ladies,
Berlin is a small place.

444
00:49:25,632 --> 00:49:28,385
I'm sure our paths
will cross again.

445
00:49:31,847 --> 00:49:33,015
Sorry.

446
00:49:33,348 --> 00:49:35,726
You looked like
you needed saving.

447
00:49:36,894 --> 00:49:40,564
My friend owns a club nearby.
Want to come check it out?

448
00:50:00,918 --> 00:50:03,670
I didn't think
that you would show.

449
00:50:05,797 --> 00:50:06,882
Stoli on the rocks'?

450
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:11,345
You pay attention.

451
00:50:14,056 --> 00:50:16,141
I look for pleasure
in the details.

452
00:50:21,939 --> 00:50:26,318
Speaking of which, I've been
dying to ask you a question.

453
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,333
Let's go someplace quiet.

454
00:51:03,981 --> 00:51:06,483
Why the gun, Delphine?

455
00:51:08,986 --> 00:51:11,905
You're not as well disguised
as you may think.

456
00:51:11,989 --> 00:51:13,073
I know who you are.

457
00:51:13,156 --> 00:51:15,784
You're Lorraine Broughton,
MI6.

458
00:51:15,867 --> 00:51:17,953
And you're here because
of the death of Gasciogne.

459
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:22,666
What do you know
about Gasciogne?

460
00:51:25,335 --> 00:51:26,545
Nothing.

461
00:51:27,045 --> 00:51:30,132
But if someone is killing allied
officers, shouldn't we all care?

462
00:51:34,636 --> 00:51:38,348
Whatever is in that list has
people willing to kill for it.

463
00:51:50,902 --> 00:51:54,156
This is my first assignment
with the French intelligence.

464
00:51:54,615 --> 00:51:57,034
I've only been here
a year.

465
00:51:58,535 --> 00:51:59,786
I'm scared, okay?

466
00:52:00,495 --> 00:52:03,290
I got into this
because it was exciting.

467
00:52:03,874 --> 00:52:06,710
But it's never been
like this in Berlin.

468
00:52:09,254 --> 00:52:11,632
You should have
become a poet.

469
00:52:15,594 --> 00:52:17,471
Or a rock star.

470
00:53:16,363 --> 00:53:18,657
So you made contact
with the French operative?

471
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:20,117
Obviously.

472
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:23,620
Why?

473
00:53:23,954 --> 00:53:27,082
I believed she had information
I could exploit.

474
00:53:27,165 --> 00:53:28,583
Nothing more.

475
00:53:29,459 --> 00:53:30,627
Kurzfeld- And did she?

476
00:53:35,382 --> 00:53:37,676
Did she have
any information, Lorraine?

477
00:53:42,264 --> 00:53:44,641
There is something
I need to tell you.

478
00:53:48,019 --> 00:53:50,981
It has to do with your friend,
Percival. He's...

479
00:54:03,368 --> 00:54:04,453
Lorraine?

480
00:54:07,164 --> 00:54:10,083
Did she have
any information, Lorraine?

481
00:54:13,628 --> 00:54:15,881
Did she
give you information?

482
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:18,633
She gave me nothing.

483
00:54:27,684 --> 00:54:29,895
David fucking Percival.

484
00:54:33,231 --> 00:54:34,566
Are you following me?

485
00:54:35,692 --> 00:54:38,695
Maybe you're not as good
at this spy shit as you think.

486
00:54:43,158 --> 00:54:45,619
That was for James,
you fucking prick!

487
00:54:45,702 --> 00:54:47,954
Now give me
that fucking list!

488
00:55:09,226 --> 00:55:12,062
Gray- We needed to get you
a message, Lorraine.

489
00:55:12,562 --> 00:55:15,357
We're several days into a
mission without a single lead.

490
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,567
And plenty of distractions.

491
00:55:18,235 --> 00:55:21,154
You have to be reminded
of the course at hand.

492
00:55:21,238 --> 00:55:23,365
Oh, I received your message.

493
00:55:37,379 --> 00:55:39,422
That's quite a view.

494
00:55:39,923 --> 00:55:46,096
70 miles of barbed wire, 31 of guard
towers, 65 anti-vehicle trenches,

495
00:55:46,471 --> 00:55:51,184
40,000 Soviet-trained,
heavily-armed frontier troops.

496
00:55:51,434 --> 00:55:52,853
All that,

497
00:55:53,812 --> 00:55:58,608
and 5,000 GDR citizens still
had the brass balls to escape.

498
00:56:00,318 --> 00:56:05,156
You've got the MI6 so worried they
called the CIA to talk sense into you.

499
00:56:07,158 --> 00:56:09,327
Eric Gray called me.

500
00:56:10,453 --> 00:56:11,705
Of course he did.

501
00:56:11,788 --> 00:56:14,875
I don't have to remind you of
how fast the clock is ticking.

502
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:17,043
If this thing gets out,

503
00:56:17,127 --> 00:56:19,546
a lot of good,
hard-working folks,

504
00:56:20,088 --> 00:56:22,966
brave men and women
are gonna show up dead.

505
00:56:23,466 --> 00:56:25,468
You and I included.

506
00:56:25,969 --> 00:56:27,637
I swear to god,
the last few weeks,

507
00:56:27,721 --> 00:56:30,473
I dread even waking up
in the morning.

508
00:56:33,268 --> 00:56:35,729
I understand the severity
of the situation, sir.

509
00:56:35,812 --> 00:56:37,856
And the time imperative.

510
00:56:39,733 --> 00:56:41,359
Listen, I didn't
climb all the way up here

511
00:56:41,443 --> 00:56:44,654
just to give you
some rousing pep talk.

512
00:56:44,738 --> 00:56:46,698
So I'll cut to the chase.

513
00:56:47,157 --> 00:56:48,992
Last night you met a woman.

514
00:56:49,826 --> 00:56:52,996
Delphine Lasalle
is out of her depth.

515
00:56:53,622 --> 00:56:56,166
Given the climate, I'd hate
to see an executive order

516
00:56:56,249 --> 00:56:59,419
come down the line that
falls in her disinterest.

517
00:57:00,629 --> 00:57:02,255
"Her disinterest"?

518
00:57:03,048 --> 00:57:05,258
What do you mean,
"her disinterest"?

519
00:57:05,342 --> 00:57:07,093
Don't insult my
intelligence, Lorraine.

520
00:57:07,177 --> 00:57:09,763
You know exactly
what I fucking mean.

521
00:57:10,388 --> 00:57:12,265
I hope you get a snapshot.

522
00:57:12,641 --> 00:57:15,894
Next week, this will be
a whole different picture.

523
00:57:24,903 --> 00:57:27,238
Satchel has been compromised.

524
00:58:32,721 --> 00:58:35,724
Meet me at the rough
trade bar at Oranienstrasse.

525
00:58:36,141 --> 00:58:37,892
We need to talk.

526
00:58:52,991 --> 00:58:55,076
Look at all these hedonists.

527
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,287
It's like a beautiful woman
gone wrong.

528
00:58:57,370 --> 00:58:58,788
I fucking love it.

529
00:59:00,749 --> 00:59:03,043
Word is Bakhtin
has resurfaced.

530
00:59:03,126 --> 00:59:05,336
Cops found him
with a homemade lobotomy.

531
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:07,964
Either way, we have
to deal with Spyglass.

532
00:59:08,048 --> 00:59:10,759
Thinking it through, he doesn't
have much time over there.

533
00:59:10,842 --> 00:59:13,595
Our priority is The List.
We can't make mistakes.

534
00:59:13,678 --> 00:59:14,679
Come on!

535
00:59:14,763 --> 00:59:16,765
He's hardly the most trustworthy
person I've ever met.

536
00:59:16,848 --> 00:59:18,433
Or the fucking brightest.

537
00:59:18,516 --> 00:59:20,310
Wait. You said
you hadn't met him.

538
00:59:23,605 --> 00:59:25,190
I lied.

539
00:59:26,316 --> 00:59:30,111
And he claims to have
memorized the entire List.

540
00:59:31,404 --> 00:59:33,573
He's ready
to make the jump.

541
00:59:34,032 --> 00:59:36,868
You believe he committed
the entire thing to memory?

542
00:59:36,951 --> 00:59:38,328
Everything.

543
00:59:39,788 --> 00:59:43,416
Had I known earlier, I would
have prioritized Spyglass.

544
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,336
His knowledge made him
as valuable as The List.

545
00:59:47,545 --> 00:59:49,214
I could have grabbed him
at any moment.

546
00:59:49,297 --> 00:59:51,591
Instead, Percival
kept it a secret,

547
00:59:51,674 --> 00:59:53,968
putting us in
a precarious position.

548
01:00:01,142 --> 01:00:02,727
Look,
the KGB are gonna have some

549
01:00:02,811 --> 01:00:05,146
very angry bastards out there
looking for Spyglass.

550
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:07,774
We can't trust any
of the old routes or methods.

551
01:00:07,857 --> 01:00:10,443
It's not that difficult to drive
across the border these days.

552
01:00:10,527 --> 01:00:12,987
It is when you're
wanted like Spyglass is.

553
01:00:13,696 --> 01:00:15,448
We have to walk him
across personally

554
01:00:15,532 --> 01:00:18,159
to ensure his safety
in plain sight.

555
01:00:18,493 --> 01:00:20,620
We'll use the demonstration
tomorrow at Alexanderplatz...

556
01:00:20,703 --> 01:00:21,788
That's insane.

557
01:00:21,871 --> 01:00:24,833
All those protesters
will make a great distraction.

558
01:00:27,001 --> 01:00:29,379
Spyglass is my guy.
We're going to do it my way.

559
01:00:31,881 --> 01:00:33,091
Fine.

560
01:00:33,174 --> 01:00:36,386
But we use my contact to get
all our papers in order.

561
01:00:36,469 --> 01:00:37,804
All right.

562
01:00:39,222 --> 01:00:40,515
Do we have a deal?

563
01:00:43,685 --> 01:00:45,979
I'll take that as a yes.

564
01:00:51,234 --> 01:00:52,443
Hmm.

565
01:00:53,444 --> 01:00:54,696
You see,

566
01:00:57,949 --> 01:01:02,328
I received a call from David
Percival that evening, Lorraine.

567
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:11,379
He said he had The List.

568
01:01:11,629 --> 01:01:13,339
I'll need
a little time to wrap it up.

569
01:01:15,383 --> 01:01:17,927
And he knew
the identity of Satchel.

570
01:01:20,096 --> 01:01:22,432
Oh, I'm very close
to Satchel.

571
01:01:43,453 --> 01:01:45,788
And no one thought to tell me?

572
01:01:47,957 --> 01:01:49,167
Hmm?

573
01:01:55,465 --> 01:01:56,633
Fuck.

574
01:02:02,472 --> 01:02:04,682
You brought
a lot of friends.

575
01:02:05,683 --> 01:02:07,977
I heard Bakhtin
had a little accident.

576
01:02:08,269 --> 01:02:11,064
I heard he slipped
and fell on an ice pick.

577
01:02:11,147 --> 01:02:12,690
Berlin's a cruel mistress.

578
01:02:12,774 --> 01:02:14,943
Especially for traitors
like Bakhtin.

579
01:02:15,026 --> 01:02:16,569
Don't be such
a fucking communist.

580
01:02:16,653 --> 01:02:17,737
You've got a problem.

581
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:20,657
Yeah, I know.
You have the fucking list.

582
01:02:23,159 --> 01:02:25,161
We've been in the trenches
long enough to know

583
01:02:25,245 --> 01:02:27,956
that at times like this, Berlin
has its own set of rules.

584
01:02:28,039 --> 01:02:31,334
I can give you information
that will keep the balance.

585
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,462
Now, are you in or out?

586
01:02:42,178 --> 01:02:44,889
Percival's trying
to set me up.

587
01:02:48,643 --> 01:02:50,311
Are you surprised?

588
01:02:52,522 --> 01:02:53,982
Not really.

589
01:02:54,065 --> 01:02:56,025
These relationships
aren't real.

590
01:02:56,109 --> 01:02:58,361
They're just
a means to an end.

591
01:03:01,489 --> 01:03:04,075
When you tell the truth,
you look different.

592
01:03:04,158 --> 01:03:05,994
Your eyes change.

593
01:03:07,328 --> 01:03:09,497
Thanks for the warning.

594
01:03:11,874 --> 01:03:12,875
What do you mean?

595
01:03:12,959 --> 01:03:15,420
I mean,
I better not do it again.

596
01:03:21,384 --> 01:03:22,593
Why?

597
01:03:26,681 --> 01:03:29,726
'Cause it's going
to get me killed one day.

598
01:04:48,513 --> 01:04:50,515
Well, lam impressed.

599
01:04:50,598 --> 01:04:53,935
I thought Merkel here
was just a good bartender.

600
01:05:03,694 --> 01:05:06,406
You smell like
a Stasi officer.

601
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:10,618
Shave off that mustache.

602
01:05:10,701 --> 01:05:13,121
Use that soap and cologne.
It's from the west.

603
01:05:13,204 --> 01:05:14,956
You can't take anything
from the east.

604
01:05:15,206 --> 01:05:16,833
Merkel will give you
some clothes.

605
01:05:17,375 --> 01:05:19,669
Right this way,
Mr. Spyglass.

606
01:05:57,206 --> 01:05:59,208
It should have been easy.

607
01:06:00,042 --> 01:06:01,335
The plan was sound.

608
01:06:01,419 --> 01:06:04,672
Whatever went wrong did so
because someone wanted it to.

609
01:06:04,755 --> 01:06:06,007
Someone from the inside.

610
01:06:06,382 --> 01:06:08,634
You were betrayed
by a fellow agent?

611
01:06:08,718 --> 01:06:10,553
You mean Satchel?

612
01:06:11,053 --> 01:06:13,055
Would that be unheard of?

613
01:06:14,307 --> 01:06:15,933
Per your request.

614
01:06:21,564 --> 01:06:23,483
You won't be
needing that.

615
01:06:23,566 --> 01:06:26,110
It will be worse
if they find it on you.

616
01:06:27,445 --> 01:06:28,821
Everything else ready?

617
01:06:28,905 --> 01:06:30,740
Yes. Everything
you requested.

618
01:06:31,407 --> 01:06:32,492
I'm ready.

619
01:06:36,454 --> 01:06:38,456
What do you think
of his shirt?

620
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:41,417
I wouldn't be
caught dead in it.

621
01:06:41,918 --> 01:06:43,920
But for him,
it's perfect.

622
01:06:44,253 --> 01:06:45,880
Stand over here.

623
01:06:48,257 --> 01:06:50,760
Now look like a free man.

624
01:06:54,430 --> 01:06:58,351
East Berlin youth leaders have
organized a demonstration this week

625
01:06:58,434 --> 01:07:00,102
at Alexanderplatz.

626
01:07:04,774 --> 01:07:07,735
Did he tell you I
memorized the whole list?

627
01:07:09,362 --> 01:07:10,655
Yes.

628
01:07:12,114 --> 01:07:15,451
I realize I may not be
valuable to some people,

629
01:07:15,535 --> 01:07:18,329
and some people
may even want me dead,

630
01:07:20,957 --> 01:07:23,125
but what choice do I have?

631
01:07:24,627 --> 01:07:29,090
You're no good to me dead. And
I've never lost a package.

632
01:07:31,634 --> 01:07:33,135
I know.

633
01:07:39,058 --> 01:07:40,059
Hey! Hey!

634
01:07:40,643 --> 01:07:42,311
It's his family.

635
01:07:43,813 --> 01:07:45,731
This was not
part of the plan.

636
01:07:45,815 --> 01:07:47,483
Part of mine.

637
01:07:49,402 --> 01:07:50,820
Please?

638
01:07:51,362 --> 01:07:52,905
I'll take the wife and kid.

639
01:07:52,989 --> 01:07:55,032
You just have
to deal with Spyglass.

640
01:07:56,409 --> 01:07:59,161
I don't know if I have
enough passports.

641
01:07:59,912 --> 01:08:03,666
Percival.
Your golden boy.

642
01:08:36,365 --> 01:08:37,658
We have to go.

643
01:08:41,704 --> 01:08:43,289
See you in the west.

644
01:08:43,372 --> 01:08:44,373
Good luck.

645
01:09:39,762 --> 01:09:41,430
This was never
part of the plan.

646
01:09:41,514 --> 01:09:43,307
It was part of mine.

647
01:10:27,268 --> 01:10:28,310
No.

648
01:10:36,235 --> 01:10:37,278
Stay low.

649
01:10:44,785 --> 01:10:46,078
In here.

650
01:10:50,166 --> 01:10:53,294
I need to deal with this now,
or we'll never get across.

651
01:10:57,757 --> 01:10:59,008
I don't want to die.

652
01:10:59,091 --> 01:11:01,093
You're not going to die.

653
01:11:01,177 --> 01:11:02,511
Stay here.

654
01:13:59,104 --> 01:14:00,189
Fuck.

655
01:14:13,702 --> 01:14:15,829
Two more. There's two more.

656
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:01,041
Go!

657
01:15:05,838 --> 01:15:07,798
We need to stop
that bleeding.

658
01:15:07,881 --> 01:15:09,341
Search for anything.

659
01:15:09,425 --> 01:15:11,593
Alcohol, rags.

660
01:17:47,749 --> 01:17:49,585
Am I a bitch, now?

661
01:18:40,469 --> 01:18:41,637
Get in.

662
01:18:42,804 --> 01:18:44,056
Get in!

663
01:18:52,147 --> 01:18:54,483
You need
to work on your German.

664
01:18:58,153 --> 01:18:59,655
It's horrible.

665
01:19:01,907 --> 01:19:03,825
What in hell?

666
01:19:52,791 --> 01:19:54,584
Fasten your seatbelt.

667
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:44,092
You all right?

668
01:20:44,176 --> 01:20:45,177
Yeah.

669
01:20:46,887 --> 01:20:48,138
We have to go...

670
01:21:01,610 --> 01:21:02,861
It's so cold!

671
01:21:02,944 --> 01:21:04,071
Open your door!

672
01:21:04,154 --> 01:21:05,739
My foot is stuck!

673
01:21:15,999 --> 01:21:17,042
Just breathe!

674
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:34,077
- You need a break?
- No.

675
01:22:43,128 --> 01:22:44,254
So...

676
01:22:45,839 --> 01:22:47,466
Yes, I think I
understand everything.

677
01:22:47,549 --> 01:22:49,050
You made your plan.

678
01:22:49,551 --> 01:22:54,431
And you failed to get the high value
asset safely across to the west.

679
01:22:54,514 --> 01:22:57,350
You sent me into
a fucking hornet's nest.

680
01:22:59,478 --> 01:23:00,854
I was made by the KGB

681
01:23:00,937 --> 01:23:03,023
from the moment
my feet touched the ground.

682
01:23:03,106 --> 01:23:04,774
Maybe even before.

683
01:23:06,776 --> 01:23:08,403
But then you knew that,
didn't you?

684
01:23:09,321 --> 01:23:11,948
You had your doubts
about Percival.

685
01:23:13,033 --> 01:23:15,577
And you used me
to shake him down.

686
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:18,580
Ready when you are.

687
01:23:37,390 --> 01:23:39,309
Hey, hey. Whoa,
whoa, whoa...

688
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:41,144
It's me! It's me!

689
01:23:52,447 --> 01:23:55,617
He's dead.
Spyglass is dead.

690
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:00,539
And you are alive.

691
01:24:02,791 --> 01:24:04,960
They're all listening to me.

692
01:24:08,004 --> 01:24:09,089
They knew.

693
01:24:10,465 --> 01:24:12,634
The KGB knew everything.

694
01:24:14,261 --> 01:24:16,054
I need to get across.

695
01:25:01,516 --> 01:25:04,644
Well, I expected more out
of the Brits than a royal goat fuck.

696
01:25:04,728 --> 01:25:06,104
I know. We're sorry.
No, wait.

697
01:25:06,187 --> 01:25:08,356
You lot don't have your own
private Stasi agent, do you?

698
01:25:09,024 --> 01:25:11,276
Not one with
a photographic memory.

699
01:25:19,659 --> 01:25:22,329
We need to get with
Broughton and get on the same page.

700
01:25:22,412 --> 01:25:24,789
We need that list.
Now more than ever.

701
01:25:26,791 --> 01:25:27,876
Broughton?

702
01:25:28,877 --> 01:25:30,462
She made it out.

703
01:25:32,380 --> 01:25:33,548
Right.

704
01:25:35,550 --> 01:25:37,969
You know, a beautiful
Italian girl once said to me,

705
01:25:38,053 --> 01:25:39,304
"David,

706
01:25:40,472 --> 01:25:43,224
"you can't unfuck
what has been fucked."

707
01:25:44,809 --> 01:25:46,978
Women are always getting in the
way of progress, aren't they?

708
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:54,444
What no one in Germany
believed possible has happened tonight.

709
01:25:54,527 --> 01:25:57,030
The wall is coming down.
The wall is down.

710
01:25:57,113 --> 01:26:01,159
(On TV'; People here have
lived with the wall since 1961.

711
01:26:01,242 --> 01:26:04,537
And I think now it's time to
break the wall down, you know?

712
01:26:04,621 --> 01:26:06,665
The wall is crumbling.

713
01:26:06,748 --> 01:26:10,460
The sledgehammers in the hands
of men not born when it went up,

714
01:26:10,543 --> 01:26:11,961
tear into it.

715
01:26:12,671 --> 01:26:16,508
Behind it, the east German
soldiers tried to stop the tide.

716
01:26:16,591 --> 01:26:18,093
Water cannons
were brought out.

717
01:26:18,176 --> 01:26:20,679
But the west Berliners
were determined.

718
01:26:20,762 --> 01:26:23,348
One west Berliner
sprayed champagne back.

719
01:26:23,431 --> 01:26:25,392
You know, if I was to
follow you, I mean, properly,

720
01:26:27,519 --> 01:26:29,020
you'd never fucking know.

721
01:26:29,771 --> 01:26:33,775
It is the moment Berliners
have waited 28 years for.

722
01:26:33,858 --> 01:26:36,027
Even the east Germans
seem exhilarated.

723
01:26:36,111 --> 01:26:38,196
A symbolic breach
in the structure

724
01:26:38,279 --> 01:26:41,783
that cost hundreds of lives, and
separated friends, families,

725
01:26:42,367 --> 01:26:44,536
and lovers for decades.

726
01:26:44,703 --> 01:26:46,746
I found
a French UHF device

727
01:26:46,955 --> 01:26:49,708
in my coat
after Spyglass died.

728
01:26:50,625 --> 01:26:53,211
I now believe it was
Percival who planted it.

729
01:26:53,294 --> 01:26:55,672
Made it look like Lasalle.

730
01:27:18,153 --> 01:27:19,821
Why are you here?

731
01:27:21,573 --> 01:27:23,700
You need to leave Berlin.

732
01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:28,329
When I didn't hear
from you, I got worried.

733
01:27:28,413 --> 01:27:30,498
How naive can you be?

734
01:27:31,666 --> 01:27:33,668
We chose this life,
Delphine.

735
01:27:35,503 --> 01:27:37,005
This only ends one way.

736
01:27:37,088 --> 01:27:38,465
What are you talking about?

737
01:27:43,178 --> 01:27:45,096
He set us both up.

738
01:27:45,430 --> 01:27:47,432
You have to leave
while you can.

739
01:28:13,333 --> 01:28:14,292
Yes?

740
01:28:14,375 --> 01:28:16,127
Don't underestimate
me, Percival.

741
01:28:16,211 --> 01:28:18,129
Oh, Lasalle, listen
to me very carefully.

742
01:28:18,213 --> 01:28:20,381
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

743
01:28:20,632 --> 01:28:21,966
You set me up.

744
01:28:22,759 --> 01:28:24,135
Come on, love.
This is the game.

745
01:28:24,219 --> 01:28:26,137
I know your secrets, David,

746
01:28:26,221 --> 01:28:29,390
and I can play this game
better than you think.

747
01:29:21,609 --> 01:29:24,279
Percival's trying to set me up.

748
01:29:25,363 --> 01:29:26,698
Are you surprised?

749
01:29:26,781 --> 01:29:28,157
Not really.

750
01:29:28,616 --> 01:29:30,451
These relationships
aren't real.

751
01:29:30,577 --> 01:29:32,871
They're just
a means to an end.

752
01:29:33,997 --> 01:29:36,916
When you tell the
truth, you look different.

753
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,626
Your eyes change.

754
01:29:38,710 --> 01:29:40,628
Thanks for the warning.

755
01:29:43,047 --> 01:29:44,048
What do you mean?

756
01:29:44,132 --> 01:29:46,301
I mean,
I better not do it again.

757
01:29:47,135 --> 01:29:48,303
Lasallei why?

758
01:29:48,386 --> 01:29:51,139
'Cause it's going
to get me killed one day.

759
01:29:55,643 --> 01:29:58,062
There is something
that I need to tell you.

760
01:30:06,446 --> 01:30:08,573
It has to do with
your friend, Percival. He's...

761
01:30:08,656 --> 01:30:10,408
Shh.

762
01:31:44,335 --> 01:31:46,212
I'm sorry, darling.

763
01:31:48,256 --> 01:31:49,549
This is the game.

764
01:32:41,559 --> 01:32:42,685
Fuck!

765
01:32:44,604 --> 01:32:46,939
Celebrations
continue in the streets tonight.

766
01:32:47,023 --> 01:32:48,983
From the moment
the first wave of east Germans

767
01:32:49,067 --> 01:32:50,068
crossed into Berlin,

768
01:32:50,151 --> 01:32:51,778
they have been
showered with champagne

769
01:32:51,861 --> 01:32:53,988
and cheered by
a crowd of thousands.

770
01:32:54,072 --> 01:32:55,073
It is clear

771
01:32:55,156 --> 01:32:58,076
this will be one of Berlin's
most dramatic days.

772
01:32:58,159 --> 01:33:00,953
East Berliners are overcome
as they cross the border

773
01:33:01,037 --> 01:33:03,247
that has been closed
to them for 28 years.

774
01:33:03,331 --> 01:33:05,500
West Berliners are
chipping away at the wall

775
01:33:05,583 --> 01:33:07,668
that scarred their city
and scaling it.

776
01:33:23,851 --> 01:33:26,437
There is no more
interference from the police.

777
01:33:26,521 --> 01:33:29,440
Unified, Berliners lay
symbols of peace.

778
01:33:29,524 --> 01:33:31,359
Thousands of them looking east
and chanting,

779
01:33:31,442 --> 01:33:32,527
"down with the wall."

780
01:33:55,424 --> 01:33:58,052
There's only one question
left to ask.

781
01:34:00,096 --> 01:34:01,681
Who won?

782
01:34:02,056 --> 01:34:04,809
And what was
the fucking game anyway?

783
01:34:05,726 --> 01:34:08,980
And I was thinking
the wall will never fall.

784
01:34:09,063 --> 01:34:12,358
Germany's peaceful revolution is
probably the political and cultural story

785
01:34:12,441 --> 01:34:13,568
of 1989.

786
01:34:13,651 --> 01:34:14,652
We're gonna
take a quick break,

787
01:34:14,735 --> 01:34:16,154
but we'll be back
with an in-depth look

788
01:34:16,237 --> 01:34:19,115
at the number-one musical
controversy of the year. Sampling.

789
01:34:19,198 --> 01:34:21,075
Is it art or is it
just plagiarism?

790
01:34:21,159 --> 01:34:22,285
Don't go away.

791
01:34:29,375 --> 01:34:30,585
Percival to win,

792
01:34:30,668 --> 01:34:33,087
first, you have to know
whose side you're on.

793
01:34:39,844 --> 01:34:41,929
In our line of work,

794
01:34:42,096 --> 01:34:46,434
that's right up there with black
holes or "to be or not to be."

795
01:34:49,270 --> 01:34:51,856
You fight the good fight, and then
one day, you wake up and you realize

796
01:34:51,939 --> 01:34:53,733
that all you were
was Satan's little helper.

797
01:35:14,295 --> 01:35:15,546
Ironic.

798
01:35:15,963 --> 01:35:19,467
The news will tell them
there will be no more secrets.

799
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:24,013
But you and I,
we both know that's not true.

800
01:35:24,972 --> 01:35:28,392
The world is run on secrets.

801
01:35:29,185 --> 01:35:30,311
Oh...

802
01:35:34,815 --> 01:35:37,526
Whoever has that list
has power.

803
01:35:37,610 --> 01:35:40,863
And without it, you're just
another fucking target.

804
01:35:48,037 --> 01:35:51,082
So what have I learned
after all this time?

805
01:35:51,165 --> 01:35:53,918
After all those
sleepless nights,

806
01:35:54,001 --> 01:35:57,255
lying to friends,
lovers, myself.

807
01:35:57,338 --> 01:36:00,424
Playing this crooked game
in this crooked town

808
01:36:00,508 --> 01:36:03,386
filled with backstabbers
and four-faced liars.

809
01:36:03,594 --> 01:36:05,096
I'll tell you
what I've learned.

810
01:36:05,179 --> 01:36:08,307
One thing
and one thing only.

811
01:36:08,391 --> 01:36:11,143
I fucking love Berlin!

812
01:36:36,711 --> 01:36:39,714
You didn't have to kill her.

813
01:36:39,797 --> 01:36:42,008
You suddenly decided
to develop a conscience

814
01:36:42,091 --> 01:36:43,884
after all you've done?

815
01:36:44,969 --> 01:36:47,013
Have you noticed
how everyone you get close to

816
01:36:47,096 --> 01:36:48,973
ends up fucking dead?

817
01:36:49,056 --> 01:36:52,101
You gave Bremovych
the details of the plan.

818
01:36:52,768 --> 01:36:55,438
You went to the KGB
to take me out.

819
01:36:57,064 --> 01:36:59,650
You were too fucking scared
to do it yourself.

820
01:36:59,734 --> 01:37:02,028
Too smart, more like.

821
01:37:03,612 --> 01:37:05,990
If those KGB pricks
had done their part,

822
01:37:06,073 --> 01:37:09,410
I'd be on my way to a hand job
with the queen by now.

823
01:37:10,244 --> 01:37:12,121
I've read that list.

824
01:37:12,538 --> 01:37:13,914
Lorraine.

825
01:37:15,291 --> 01:37:16,667
Phew.

826
01:37:16,751 --> 01:37:18,711
And you feature heavily.

827
01:37:18,794 --> 01:37:22,465
It turns out, you've been
a very naughty girl.

828
01:37:24,592 --> 01:37:27,053
Spyglass was a liability
to us all.

829
01:37:27,136 --> 01:37:29,305
I couldn't risk
leaving him with you.

830
01:37:29,388 --> 01:37:31,474
Where's The List, David?

831
01:37:31,557 --> 01:37:33,309
I don't have it.

832
01:37:33,392 --> 01:37:37,104
It's en route to MI6
where it belongs.

833
01:37:37,438 --> 01:37:39,523
No!

834
01:37:52,161 --> 01:37:54,872
Are you going to lie
till the very end?

835
01:38:00,961 --> 01:38:03,297
Truth and lies.

836
01:38:04,507 --> 01:38:06,133
People like us
don't know the difference.

837
01:38:06,217 --> 01:38:08,135
No, we know
the difference, David.

838
01:38:09,136 --> 01:38:10,304
We choose to ignore it.

839
01:38:12,640 --> 01:38:15,101
Isn't that right,
comrade Satchel?

840
01:38:17,353 --> 01:38:19,188
So that's how
you'll make it work.

841
01:38:19,271 --> 01:38:22,608
"It's a double pleasure
to deceive the deceiver."

842
01:38:22,691 --> 01:38:23,984
Well played.

843
01:38:41,168 --> 01:38:43,170
You killed David Percival?

844
01:38:46,006 --> 01:38:49,051
All the paperwork is in order
for the bodies of James Gasciogne

845
01:38:49,135 --> 01:38:50,845
and David Percival.

846
01:38:53,973 --> 01:38:57,560
You killed our head of station,
an officer of the crown.

847
01:38:58,185 --> 01:39:00,938
You'd better have hard proof
and a damn good explanation.

848
01:39:01,021 --> 01:39:02,606
Who are you
to judge my actions?

849
01:39:02,690 --> 01:39:04,608
I'm your superior.

850
01:39:11,031 --> 01:39:13,242
My superior.

851
01:39:15,286 --> 01:39:17,705
This was never about
stopping the war.

852
01:39:17,788 --> 01:39:19,999
It was about
saving your ass.

853
01:39:20,708 --> 01:39:24,378
You couldn't bear the
embarrassment of the sins

854
01:39:24,462 --> 01:39:26,839
that we committed
in the cold war.

855
01:39:27,298 --> 01:39:30,301
And I was stupid enough
to give my life for it.

856
01:39:30,384 --> 01:39:33,512
Yes, well, that's
your job, isn't it?

857
01:39:33,596 --> 01:39:34,638
I did my job.

858
01:39:38,767 --> 01:39:42,021
Despite your best efforts
and your incompetence,

859
01:39:43,564 --> 01:39:46,275
l succeeded
where you failed.

860
01:39:47,818 --> 01:39:50,488
I uncovered your traitor,
Satchel.

861
01:39:51,197 --> 01:39:53,991
Brought him the only justice
he deserved.

862
01:39:57,244 --> 01:39:58,787
A bullet.

863
01:40:00,414 --> 01:40:02,166
Percival meeting
with Bremovych

864
01:40:02,249 --> 01:40:04,460
the day before
Spyglass was killed.

865
01:40:05,586 --> 01:40:07,796
Maybe we
can make some sort of arrangement.

866
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:10,549
You've got to
know that I'm the only man in this town

867
01:40:10,633 --> 01:40:12,009
that can help
you get that list.

868
01:40:12,092 --> 01:40:13,677
Very impressive.

869
01:40:13,761 --> 01:40:17,223
A dedication, a loyalty
is a rare thing these days.

870
01:40:17,723 --> 01:40:20,768
"It's a double pleasure
to deceive the deceiver. "

871
01:40:25,940 --> 01:40:27,316
We have a deal?

872
01:40:29,944 --> 01:40:30,945
What about the British?

873
01:40:31,570 --> 01:40:33,239
Do you trust Gray?

874
01:40:33,447 --> 01:40:34,490
Percival no.

875
01:40:34,573 --> 01:40:35,866
What about C?

876
01:40:35,950 --> 01:40:38,911
C is an arrogant lap dog who
understands precisely fuck all

877
01:40:38,994 --> 01:40:41,205
beyond the edge of his desk.

878
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:46,627
Percival was Satchel.

879
01:40:52,883 --> 01:40:54,510
Where's The List?

880
01:40:55,302 --> 01:40:57,513
Where's The List, Lorraine?

881
01:40:58,180 --> 01:40:59,932
I don't know.

882
01:41:03,227 --> 01:41:04,687
Oh, bollocks.

883
01:41:04,770 --> 01:41:06,939
The prime minister is going to
have a difficult time with this.

884
01:41:12,152 --> 01:41:14,154
We're choosing to bury
this one, Broughton.

885
01:41:14,822 --> 01:41:17,324
Your mission
never took place.

886
01:41:17,408 --> 01:41:18,659
This conversation

887
01:41:21,787 --> 01:41:23,455
never happened.

888
01:41:26,208 --> 01:41:29,044
I'm putting you on leave,
effective immediately.

889
01:41:29,128 --> 01:41:32,506
We'll start the next decade
well-rested.

890
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:35,634
C?

891
01:41:38,178 --> 01:41:39,930
What should I wear

892
01:41:46,103 --> 01:41:48,147
for my tea with the queen?

893
01:43:12,147 --> 01:43:13,148
Hmm?

894
01:45:59,398 --> 01:46:02,860
Did you really think I
was going to give you that list?

895
01:46:03,861 --> 01:46:04,987
Before you die,

896
01:46:05,070 --> 01:46:08,156
I want to get this through
your thick, primitive skull.

897
01:46:10,242 --> 01:46:11,702
I never worked for you.

898
01:46:12,953 --> 01:46:14,955
You worked for me.

899
01:46:21,628 --> 01:46:25,674
Every false intel I gave you,
a rip in the iron curtain.

900
01:46:28,218 --> 01:46:31,346
Every piece of intel you gave
me, a bullet in my fucking gun.

901
01:46:32,681 --> 01:46:34,516
I want my life back.

902
01:47:22,856 --> 01:47:23,857
Safe travels.

903
01:47:50,342 --> 01:47:53,971
Estimated flight time
to Langley, 11 hours and 37 minutes.

904
01:47:54,429 --> 01:47:56,223
Cleared for takeoff.

905
01:47:56,765 --> 01:47:58,266
Let's go home.

906
01:47:58,892 --> 01:48:00,644
That sounds good.

907
01:48:02,229 --> 01:48:03,730
Let's go home.

908
01:48:10,779 --> 01:48:12,114
Cocksucker?

909
01:48:13,365 --> 01:48:14,700
Really?

910
01:48:17,661 --> 01:48:19,830
I'm glad
it was convincing.
