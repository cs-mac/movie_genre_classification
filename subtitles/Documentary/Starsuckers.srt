1
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:20,929
Welcome.

2
00:00:21,475 --> 00:00:25,080
We, the sponsors, would like
to thank you, the audience,

3
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,520
for everything you've done for us so far.

4
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,839
Most of you have been
unwitting participants

5
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,959
in our greatest illusions.

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,319
So, at the end of our show,

7
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,919
we're going to reveal
how they have been orchestrated.

8
00:00:41,972 --> 00:00:46,519
But first, it is necessary to learn
the methods we use every day

9
00:00:46,544 --> 00:00:54,483
to captivate, misdirect,
distract and control.

10
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,999
All of our methods rely on you...

11
00:01:02,481 --> 00:01:06,894
...and your natural attraction
to this one simple thing.

12
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,999
Who is this? I don't know.

13
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,483
Who are these people?
Who are these people, bro?

14
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,830
Who is this?

15
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,958
From now on we don't know each other.

16
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:30,918
I won't talk to you like I know you.

17
00:01:30,919 --> 00:01:31,558
Mum's the word.

18
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:33,320
Mum's the word.
And I don't know any of you, OK?

19
00:01:33,321 --> 00:01:35,879
This is Chris everyone and this is Felicity,
and these are our celebrities.

20
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,360
Give us a couple of minutes,

21
00:01:37,361 --> 00:01:40,279
we'll go down to the street
and we'll ambush you there.

22
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,000
OK, you'll ambush us on the street?

23
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:45,959
Well, there's going to be a nice
staircase that you'll descend

24
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,957
and we'll get you at some point.

25
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:50,807
# THE SERENDIPITY SINGERS:
Everybody Loves Saturday Night.

26
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,986
You too can enjoy
the celeb-for-a-day experience

27
00:01:53,995 --> 00:01:55,914
for only $300 per hour.

28
00:01:58,165 --> 00:02:01,227
Now, you may be thinking
that you would not be bewitched

29
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:03,186
by the spell of celebrity,

30
00:02:03,187 --> 00:02:06,066
but it is worth noting
that all of these people

31
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:08,274
would probably say the same thing.

32
00:02:08,297 --> 00:02:11,202
Hey, paparazzi, ready to go!

33
00:02:15,075 --> 00:02:18,426
So we're having a hard time. Can you
keep them out, get them arrested?

34
00:02:22,536 --> 00:02:24,692
Have you guys got a back exit or something?

35
00:02:27,223 --> 00:02:27,747
Thank you so much.

36
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:30,146
You saved our lives, thank you, thank you.

37
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,146
If you guys are here again,
call me in the office.

38
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:47,419
Everybody is naturally
and powerfully attracted to fame

39
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,695
even though most people will deny it.

40
00:02:51,946 --> 00:02:56,524
This principle has allowed us access
into every part of your world

41
00:02:57,786 --> 00:03:01,786
and is now the foundation
of our entire business.

42
00:03:04,634 --> 00:03:07,913
These are the five lessons
that need to be learned

43
00:03:07,914 --> 00:03:11,914
to be able to use fame
as a means of control.

44
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:17,033
In different ways,
they all take advantage of

45
00:03:17,034 --> 00:03:19,861
your basic needs and desires.

46
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,799
It is only through
a combination of these lessons

47
00:03:24,801 --> 00:03:28,801
that one can master
the greatest illusion of them all,

48
00:03:29,886 --> 00:03:33,666
an illusion so great it has given us a seat

49
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:36,786
at the tables of power throughout the world

50
00:03:36,787 --> 00:03:42,867
and unlimited influence
in raising the next generation.

51
00:03:46,187 --> 00:03:50,187
Our first lesson is all about motivation,

52
00:03:50,387 --> 00:03:56,353
as our business depends on everybody
believing that they can succeed.

53
00:03:57,307 --> 00:04:01,305
We like this message
to be absorbed as young as possible,

54
00:04:01,306 --> 00:04:06,534
because kids that follow the dream
will always be our best customers.

55
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:09,265
So, from the day they are born,

56
00:04:09,267 --> 00:04:12,746
we convince kids that the key to happiness

57
00:04:12,747 --> 00:04:15,831
lies in the entertainment industry.

58
00:04:17,595 --> 00:04:20,065
(TV) 'It's all about the personality.

59
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:23,746
JT and Jessica
put the break-up rumours to rest.

60
00:04:23,747 --> 00:04:26,016
This is E-News.

61
00:04:26,547 --> 00:04:30,410
When Ri-Yan came up and said,
you know, "I want to model."

62
00:04:30,411 --> 00:04:32,346
"Can you find me some place
where I can model?"

63
00:04:32,347 --> 00:04:34,506
What, when he was three years old?

64
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,626
Hello, everybody, my name is Alex Simon.

65
00:04:36,627 --> 00:04:40,185
I am the owner and founder of Kids Talent
Network, based in Las Vegas, Nevada.

66
00:04:40,186 --> 00:04:44,141
We have - nationwide -
over 1,900 clients now.

67
00:04:44,142 --> 00:04:45,106
People just contact us

68
00:04:45,107 --> 00:04:48,146
and actually about 200 new faces
a day we see here.

69
00:04:48,147 --> 00:04:49,585
Can you say hi, can you say hi?

70
00:04:49,586 --> 00:04:51,267
Can you say hi, can you say hi?
How was it in there?

71
00:04:51,268 --> 00:04:54,177
A lot of what we do
is we actually scout children

72
00:04:54,178 --> 00:04:56,257
around the country for agencies.

73
00:04:57,102 --> 00:05:00,267
I come looking for the kid
with the special "it"

74
00:05:00,307 --> 00:05:03,400
that I can really work with
and get 'em to Hollywood.

75
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:10,036
So I've got to make it bigger
and better for my resume.

76
00:05:10,037 --> 00:05:11,832
Why do you want it to be bigger and better?

77
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:16,255
Because... Oh, Jeez, that's a hard one.

78
00:05:16,256 --> 00:05:17,496
To be a superstar?

79
00:05:17,497 --> 00:05:22,691
Yeah, and a Grammy Award and...
I don't know.

80
00:05:22,692 --> 00:05:23,850
An Oscar?

81
00:05:23,851 --> 00:05:25,993
What the heck is that?

82
00:05:25,994 --> 00:05:27,754
It's a big statue. (LAUGHS)

83
00:05:28,353 --> 00:05:30,831
No matter where we go, it's just attention.

84
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:32,272
He causes a commotion.

85
00:05:32,273 --> 00:05:33,672
Can he take some pictures
with you guys on the other side?

86
00:05:33,673 --> 00:05:35,874
The other side of the street, yeah!

87
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,930
One, two, three... cheeseburgers.

88
00:05:40,194 --> 00:05:42,747
They're doing a documentary on my son.

89
00:05:46,153 --> 00:05:49,123
Do you want me to carry you?
No, you're good? OK.

90
00:05:49,124 --> 00:05:52,092
Are you cold? OK, here you go. He's cold.

91
00:05:55,883 --> 00:05:57,923
The next step in Ri-Yan's career
is breaking into

92
00:05:57,925 --> 00:06:00,377
the Los Angeles and the Hollywood market.

93
00:06:02,283 --> 00:06:04,762
Look at you! Superstar!

94
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:07,963
Oh, my God,
he comes with his own little crew!

95
00:06:07,964 --> 00:06:10,563
This particular agent is, if not the best,

96
00:06:10,564 --> 00:06:12,524
one of the top agents in Los Angeles.

97
00:06:12,525 --> 00:06:16,524
Ri-Yan's just very advanced,
personally and professionally,

98
00:06:16,724 --> 00:06:20,203
for his age, which makes him
very attractive for agents,

99
00:06:20,204 --> 00:06:23,123
casting directors,
and for work on film and TV.

100
00:06:23,527 --> 00:06:26,030
The kid barely reads at the age of five,

101
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:27,550
so it's more challenging.

102
00:06:27,551 --> 00:06:30,430
So I overslept.

103
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,070
I just...

104
00:06:32,071 --> 00:06:33,990
I just... No, no, no, no, no, no.

105
00:06:33,991 --> 00:06:37,750
So I overslept, and what's the first
thing you want when you wake up?

106
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:40,470
I want my Kellogg's Corn Pops.

107
00:06:40,471 --> 00:06:41,711
OK, let me start again.

108
00:06:41,712 --> 00:06:42,830
OK, all right.

109
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:46,831
So I overslept,
I want my Kellogg's Corn Pops,

110
00:06:47,471 --> 00:06:52,049
I just had to...
I just got to have my Corn Pops.

111
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:53,670
I just got to have my Pops. OK?

112
00:06:53,671 --> 00:06:54,349
Oh, yeah.

113
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,711
Oh, yeah. OK, all right, again.

114
00:06:55,712 --> 00:06:57,748
All right, you can do it.

115
00:06:57,749 --> 00:07:00,155
So you overslept, you want your Corn Pops,

116
00:07:00,156 --> 00:07:02,297
and you just got to have your Pops,
OK, all right.

117
00:07:02,298 --> 00:07:05,695
So I overslept. I...
I want my Kellogg's Corn Pops.

118
00:07:05,696 --> 00:07:09,135
I just nee... I just got...

119
00:07:10,158 --> 00:07:14,506
We know smoking's bad for us, we know
fast food's bad for us, alcohol...

120
00:07:14,507 --> 00:07:17,530
violence on television,
there's all this stuff about

121
00:07:17,531 --> 00:07:20,770
how many killings kids will see on TV,
yet there's nothing about this.

122
00:07:20,771 --> 00:07:24,771
I teamed up with Syracuse University
and we did a survey of about 750

123
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:28,975
American teenagers, and one of
the questions in the survey was.

124
00:07:28,976 --> 00:07:31,649
If you could press a magic button
that would make you

125
00:07:31,655 --> 00:07:35,014
either stronger, smarter,
more famous or beautiful,

126
00:07:35,015 --> 00:07:36,934
which would you pick?

127
00:07:36,935 --> 00:07:41,934
And we found that boys opted for fame
almost as often as intelligence,

128
00:07:41,935 --> 00:07:45,935
and girls actually picked fame
more often than intelligence.

129
00:07:46,055 --> 00:07:50,313
Children now spend twice as much
time in front of a screen

130
00:07:50,534 --> 00:07:52,123
as they do in school,

131
00:07:52,124 --> 00:07:55,117
and 1.5 times more time
in front of a screen

132
00:07:55,118 --> 00:07:58,244
than with their parents,
which is quite phenomenal.

133
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:00,404
We found if you compared kids that watched

134
00:08:00,405 --> 00:08:02,124
one hour of television a day

135
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,963
versus kids that watched
five hours of television a day,

136
00:08:04,964 --> 00:08:07,643
they were twice as likely
to pick the fame button.

137
00:08:07,645 --> 00:08:09,413
If you don't have anything
and you're constantly

138
00:08:09,414 --> 00:08:12,572
being bombarded with images
of people who do have stuff,

139
00:08:12,573 --> 00:08:14,971
that can make it quite tough.

140
00:08:14,972 --> 00:08:19,107
In poverty, fame is just...
It's the cure-all.

141
00:08:19,122 --> 00:08:21,321
It's the ultimate panacea.

142
00:08:21,748 --> 00:08:23,769
Narcissism, what this means is,

143
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,271
people feeling they're
the centre of the universe.

144
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:29,031
But the characteristics of narcissism

145
00:08:29,032 --> 00:08:31,511
seem to be rising within the population.

146
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,952
There was personality study
in the United States.

147
00:08:33,953 --> 00:08:37,952
Well, back in the early '50s,
only 12% of teenagers said,

148
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,917
"Yes, I'm an important person."

149
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:45,318
By 1989, that number had risen to 80%.

150
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:49,158
I think there's no doubt that
the media are the main ways

151
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:52,559
that this is communicated to young people.

152
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,292
By turning our young audience into
narcissists, we encourage the belief

153
00:08:57,293 --> 00:08:59,982
that they will one day get on television.

154
00:08:59,983 --> 00:09:04,312
So we created reality television
to feed this aspiration.

155
00:09:04,695 --> 00:09:06,512
Every day we go out into the public,

156
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:09,351
looking for new talent for these shows

157
00:09:10,173 --> 00:09:12,725
and this is how it's done.

158
00:09:13,525 --> 00:09:16,164
Set up a pitch in your local shopping mall

159
00:09:16,165 --> 00:09:18,125
right next to the biggest candy stall.

160
00:09:18,126 --> 00:09:21,364
So you wanted to have a go,
trying out for being on TV today?

161
00:09:21,365 --> 00:09:23,727
Hire some attractive researchers

162
00:09:23,728 --> 00:09:27,207
who are fluent
in impressive-sounding TV jargon.

163
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:30,273
Auditions for children's TV, yeah.

164
00:09:30,322 --> 00:09:34,279
They're dealing a lot with social issues
that are affecting children at the moment.

165
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,719
Just enjoy it, relax.

166
00:09:36,069 --> 00:09:36,999
It's just fun.

167
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,678
This is just about the release forms.

168
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:41,200
Get everybody to sign a consent form,

169
00:09:41,201 --> 00:09:45,719
signing away the right to use
their child's image in any context

170
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,720
on all media, throughout the known
universe, until the end of time.

171
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,239
They say a couple of pieces to camera,

172
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,918
you sign a form to give consent

173
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,278
and if the producers like them,
they get to go on television.

174
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,360
Oh, wow!

175
00:09:57,361 --> 00:10:00,039
We want to take young children
into abattoirs

176
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,800
and teach them what happens to meat

177
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,344
before it ends up on supermarket shelves.

178
00:10:04,967 --> 00:10:06,167
Come into our studio!

179
00:10:07,224 --> 00:10:11,423
Erect a sophisticated tent
with the latest technical wizardry

180
00:10:11,424 --> 00:10:13,343
to shoot the screen tests.

181
00:10:14,042 --> 00:10:15,101
There we go.

182
00:10:15,102 --> 00:10:16,821
All right.

183
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:20,823
My name's Paris and I work
in the slaughterhouse.

184
00:10:23,662 --> 00:10:27,261
There's going to be blood
at the slaughterhouse.

185
00:10:27,262 --> 00:10:30,821
I feel like chicken tonight.

186
00:10:36,628 --> 00:10:39,893
We're looking at the effects of
alcohol on younger children.

187
00:10:39,894 --> 00:10:43,624
Do you want to go for the drinking one,
a bit of baby boozing? Brilliant.

188
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:46,583
Use charm and persuasion
to get the best performance

189
00:10:46,584 --> 00:10:48,265
out of the young talent.

190
00:10:48,266 --> 00:10:50,106
That's actually the name of the show.

191
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:53,225
And also, if you can just
act a little bit drunk,

192
00:10:53,226 --> 00:10:54,586
just a bit kind of...

193
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:57,031
slurring, slurring your words,
that sort of thing.

194
00:10:57,037 --> 00:10:58,699
That would be quite good.

195
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,101
My name is Jagon. I'm a baby boozer.

196
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:04,590
Don't worry, I'm not driving.

197
00:11:04,607 --> 00:11:08,848
And no matter how far we go,
we can always blame the parents.

198
00:11:08,849 --> 00:11:10,648
Amy, listen, all you've got to do

199
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:14,408
is look at the camera, say your name
and say, "The next round's on me."

200
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:15,968
That's it. OK? Go on then.

201
00:11:15,969 --> 00:11:17,048
I want more!

202
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:20,248
You can have some sweets afterwards,
darling. Say, "Cheers."

203
00:11:20,249 --> 00:11:22,424
Sweets are afterwards, darling.

204
00:11:23,327 --> 00:11:24,079
Is she doing all right?

205
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,437
Well, we thought we'd just get her
to try and decapitate a chicken.

206
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:28,918
Cut the chicken's head off.

207
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:31,517
Like this...

208
00:11:31,518 --> 00:11:32,677
...and go bang.

209
00:11:32,678 --> 00:11:35,477
How would you feel
if your child was successful?

210
00:11:35,478 --> 00:11:38,757
Er, pretty good actually cos
it means it'll give them a chance

211
00:11:38,758 --> 00:11:40,917
to see something they don't normally see.

212
00:11:40,918 --> 00:11:43,117
It's a parent's best dream, isn't it?

213
00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:46,637
Like, having your kids sort of
being on TV. Yeah, it'd be good.

214
00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:49,481
Take care, we'll be in touch. Thank you.

215
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,837
We can't help but be affected

216
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:57,563
by this kind of all-pervasive sense
of celebrity success.

217
00:11:58,462 --> 00:12:00,781
It's absolutely... Not...

218
00:12:00,782 --> 00:12:04,687
I was going to say surrounding us,
it actually invades us as well.

219
00:12:04,688 --> 00:12:07,687
It becomes part of
the way we understand the world,

220
00:12:07,688 --> 00:12:10,352
the lens through which
we look at the world.

221
00:12:12,327 --> 00:12:15,653
The child could be in the jungle
and think that this is wonderful,

222
00:12:15,654 --> 00:12:18,773
but the child won't know about
the dangers that are lurking.

223
00:12:18,774 --> 00:12:21,271
And sooner or later that child,

224
00:12:21,272 --> 00:12:25,272
just as surely as they would fall
foul of predators in the jungle,

225
00:12:25,472 --> 00:12:29,067
will fall foul of predators
in the world of media.

226
00:12:29,733 --> 00:12:31,842
We run a global business

227
00:12:31,843 --> 00:12:36,482
but our British and American
affiliates have the best product,

228
00:12:36,483 --> 00:12:39,108
as well as the most loyal customers.

229
00:12:40,283 --> 00:12:44,283
Everybody has bought into
the dream we've created

230
00:12:44,323 --> 00:12:48,323
and there is now an insatiable
demand for TV shows involving kids.

231
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:52,957
We are now making these shows
faster than anyone can watch them.

232
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,139
All in the name of factual entertainment.

233
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,278
I just feel really, really scared.

234
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,038
Please leave me alone! I hate you!

235
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:17,039
Fear no doubts.
I don't want to be here anymore.

236
00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:20,478
They've stuck me in prison
because I fell in love with somebody.

237
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:22,849
I just love this girl so much, I really do.

238
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:28,931
My brother is, like,
doing a very big thing for Cyprus.

239
00:13:28,932 --> 00:13:30,731
It made me cry.

240
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:35,631
Like any craving, the more we
supply, the greater the demand.

241
00:13:37,806 --> 00:13:41,806
The key is making it seem
genuinely attainable.

242
00:13:45,406 --> 00:13:48,485
Our second lesson is all about addiction,

243
00:13:49,102 --> 00:13:53,102
which, fortunately for us,
is for life, not just for childhood.

244
00:13:54,102 --> 00:13:57,782
This is how we can keep someone
trying to succeed,

245
00:13:57,783 --> 00:13:59,807
even when they're likely to fail.

246
00:14:00,971 --> 00:14:03,450
And, as failure is so abundant,

247
00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:07,371
it's easy to find new ways
to make money out of it.

248
00:14:09,192 --> 00:14:10,671
OK, welcome, everybody.

249
00:14:10,672 --> 00:14:13,111
Give yourself a hand for being here today.

250
00:14:13,112 --> 00:14:17,112
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

251
00:14:17,312 --> 00:14:18,351
Good.

252
00:14:18,352 --> 00:14:21,071
This is the New York Reality TV School.

253
00:14:21,072 --> 00:14:23,831
You might be sitting next to,
you probably are, sitting next to

254
00:14:23,832 --> 00:14:25,970
one of the next big stars.

255
00:14:25,971 --> 00:14:28,370
I've been coaching actors,
directing theatre,

256
00:14:28,371 --> 00:14:32,371
directing internet television
and live events for years.

257
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:35,889
Actors don't have money and need
training and there's this new genre,

258
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,089
called reality, where you don't
have to be an actor.

259
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:41,689
You have money, a job, cos you're
a real person. And you need training.

260
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:45,169
I'm going to introduce the wonderful
producer/casting director.

261
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,409
Risa Tanania.

262
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,929
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

263
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:53,569
If I were to say, "Why should you be here?"
and you say you're interesting,

264
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:54,929
that is such a turn off.

265
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:58,009
If I were to say, "Why do you want
to be on reality TV?"

266
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:02,249
and your answer is, "Because
I want to piss my parents off."

267
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,569
That's fantastic.

268
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,049
Do practise your story. Do watch reality.

269
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,169
Watch reality TV.

270
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,089
How dare you not watch reality TV

271
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:13,249
and want to be a part of that culture?

272
00:15:13,264 --> 00:15:18,009
It has changed the way we live, the way we look
at the world, the way we look at each other.

273
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,249
Huge amounts of children watch.

274
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,009
Yes.

275
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,439
And do you think that that's a good thing?

276
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,198
Do you think that 6, 7, 8 year-old
kids watching Celebrity Rehab

277
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,157
and 'I Want To Be A Pussy Cat Doll'
is good?

278
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,520
I'm not. I'm not, no.
That's a ridiculous question, I'm sorry.

279
00:15:30,521 --> 00:15:32,839
Those children - 6, 7 and 8 -
they have parents.

280
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,318
Those parents need to be aware of what their
children are watching. That's not...

281
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:38,400
But they're not though,
I mean, everyone knows.

282
00:15:38,401 --> 00:15:39,719
Did you ever sneak off

283
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,438
and watch television you weren't
supposed to watch as a child?

284
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,278
No, well, I actually was, like,
raised by a television.

285
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,760
I was raised by a television.

286
00:15:44,761 --> 00:15:46,879
Here is the veteran.

287
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,879
Here he is - Robert Russell!

288
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,879
APPLAUSE

289
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,359
In here today, one in particular
that has actually auditioned for me

290
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,439
for Big Brother many, many times.

291
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,759
If you're not going to get on
once, you won't a second time.

292
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,439
People are obsessed.

293
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,599
Especially their specific show
that they want to be on.

294
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,399
When they want to be on it,
they will continually come

295
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,559
and continually try to make it happen.

296
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,531
And is that healthy?

297
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,287
No.

298
00:16:19,982 --> 00:16:21,878
But who cares? We're making money.

299
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,965
Sign that.

300
00:16:28,382 --> 00:16:32,261
No matter how often our customers
gamble with their future,

301
00:16:32,262 --> 00:16:35,255
the house is always going to win.

302
00:16:37,781 --> 00:16:41,781
Our profit depends on them constantly
returning to try their luck.

303
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:46,179
Even though the odds
are stacked against them.

304
00:16:49,203 --> 00:16:51,002
So, I overslept.

305
00:16:51,003 --> 00:16:55,003
I want my Kellogg's Corn Pops.
I just got to have my pops.

306
00:16:55,323 --> 00:16:58,978
All right buddy, that was great.
All right, let's go do it.

307
00:16:59,803 --> 00:17:03,803
10 minutes of practice that could mean the
beginning of a great career in acting

308
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:05,363
or it could be the end of it.

309
00:17:05,364 --> 00:17:08,602
From what I heard, it went great.
The agent loved Ri-Yan,

310
00:17:08,603 --> 00:17:12,562
has big plans for him.
It was, all in all, just tremendous.

311
00:17:12,563 --> 00:17:15,042
So Ri-Yan, tell us how was the interview?

312
00:17:15,043 --> 00:17:18,522
It was pretty good and...

313
00:17:18,523 --> 00:17:23,146
I liked it and I'm going to sign
with it... sign with the agent.

314
00:17:23,147 --> 00:17:26,666
They're ready to put him to work immediately
so we're really excited about that.

315
00:17:27,503 --> 00:17:32,800
Instead of going "hmmm",
I want more "aarrgghhh".

316
00:17:33,107 --> 00:17:33,771
Arrgh!

317
00:17:33,894 --> 00:17:34,550
Good.

318
00:17:34,551 --> 00:17:35,318
Arrrgh!

319
00:17:35,935 --> 00:17:36,669
Arggh!

320
00:17:36,685 --> 00:17:38,005
That was one of the best.

321
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:40,485
Usually, at this age...

322
00:17:40,486 --> 00:17:41,524
I don't even shoot them.

323
00:17:41,525 --> 00:17:42,764
Really?

324
00:17:42,765 --> 00:17:43,366
Really.

325
00:17:43,367 --> 00:17:46,205
Why, why? Do they just not
respond to you or...?

326
00:17:46,206 --> 00:17:47,845
They're a pain in the ass!

327
00:17:47,846 --> 00:17:50,485
I used to shoot a lot of kids
and I stopped doing it

328
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,525
because it was so much work, you know?

329
00:17:52,526 --> 00:17:55,604
See, I like that attitude
more than I do that.

330
00:17:55,605 --> 00:17:58,604
I think he's got great listening skills.

331
00:17:58,606 --> 00:18:01,245
That's what makes him very unique.

332
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,045
That's the most important thing.
Most people don't.

333
00:18:04,046 --> 00:18:06,006
I don't have great listening skills.

334
00:18:06,007 --> 00:18:10,426
I have horrible listening skills. I don't
listen to anybody. Fuck them, listen to me!

335
00:18:10,427 --> 00:18:13,826
Go back a little further and you
got to turn sideways even more.

336
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:16,692
Do you think that he's got what it
takes to make it to the big time?

337
00:18:16,699 --> 00:18:18,620
Oh, without a doubt.

338
00:18:18,621 --> 00:18:22,459
As long as he can take direction,
cos it's all illusion anyway.

339
00:18:22,491 --> 00:18:24,610
Like you're looking down a gun.

340
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:26,454
Yo!

341
00:18:26,468 --> 00:18:27,843
Yeah, I like that..

342
00:18:27,844 --> 00:18:30,195
We don't have money, I work everyday.

343
00:18:30,196 --> 00:18:32,115
My wife works here, you know.

344
00:18:32,116 --> 00:18:34,195
We beg and borrow. We trade.

345
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:34,636
Like with Carlo, we trade.

346
00:18:34,637 --> 00:18:38,510
With Carlo, he charges
$5000 for a photo shoot.

347
00:18:38,511 --> 00:18:41,030
He gave us all the pictures, all the rights

348
00:18:41,031 --> 00:18:43,241
and he said just pay
me whatever, whenever you can.

349
00:18:43,242 --> 00:18:47,361
The little bit of struggle we have right now is
going to be a distant memory so we're really...

350
00:18:47,362 --> 00:18:49,601
And Ri-Yan too, he talks
about it the same way.

351
00:18:49,602 --> 00:18:52,841
On the way home the other day
and he said, "You know what, Mom?"

352
00:18:52,842 --> 00:18:56,521
I'm going to buy you a really
big house when I make it big,

353
00:18:56,522 --> 00:19:00,812
but I'm going to but it, not Dad.
I was like, "OK".

354
00:19:01,764 --> 00:19:04,866
You know, of course they would
like him to be huge,

355
00:19:04,867 --> 00:19:08,640
but I think they're realising now
that we've got signed in Los Angeles

356
00:19:08,641 --> 00:19:13,371
and they started auditioning, it's a taller
task than they imagined it would be.

357
00:19:13,921 --> 00:19:18,767
Now remember, they're driving
8-10 hours for a 30-second audition

358
00:19:18,768 --> 00:19:20,605
and driving all the way back.

359
00:19:20,606 --> 00:19:23,125
You know, the first time you do it,
it's OK, the second time...

360
00:19:23,126 --> 00:19:25,788
but try 15, 20 times, 30 times.

361
00:19:27,389 --> 00:19:31,045
And you're spending gas money,
taking a day off work.

362
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:33,365
A lot of people just say
"We can't afford it,"

363
00:19:33,366 --> 00:19:37,045
or "We don't like it," or "We don't think
anything is ever going to happen."

364
00:19:37,046 --> 00:19:39,285
So that's the stage
they're getting into now.

365
00:19:39,286 --> 00:19:40,886
(RI-YAN'S MUM) So what did we do today?

366
00:19:40,887 --> 00:19:45,498
I did a Coke audition in California.

367
00:19:45,499 --> 00:19:46,892
So how you think you did?

368
00:19:46,893 --> 00:19:47,922
Good.

369
00:19:47,923 --> 00:19:48,562
You think so?

370
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:49,362
Yeah.

371
00:19:49,363 --> 00:19:51,404
So, what are we going to do now?

372
00:19:51,405 --> 00:19:53,603
Er... we're driving back.

373
00:19:53,604 --> 00:19:55,122
You ready for school tomorrow?

374
00:19:55,123 --> 00:19:57,362
Yeah, boring as all.

375
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,042
Did you do any homework?

376
00:19:58,043 --> 00:19:58,882
No.

377
00:19:58,883 --> 00:20:00,282
Whoopsee!

378
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:01,002
Yeah.

379
00:20:01,003 --> 00:20:02,604
Got to do some homework, right?

380
00:20:02,605 --> 00:20:04,203
Yeah, before anything.

381
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:06,697
OK, say bye.

382
00:20:09,524 --> 00:20:11,883
Over-optimism is a great human trait.

383
00:20:11,884 --> 00:20:15,884
In most areas in life, looking for
the positive side gets us through.

384
00:20:18,324 --> 00:20:20,804
In very simple layman's terms,
I think the easiest way to say

385
00:20:20,805 --> 00:20:24,043
what's the difference between
a healthy excess of enthusiasm

386
00:20:24,044 --> 00:20:27,083
and an addiction is that
healthy enthusiasms add to life

387
00:20:27,084 --> 00:20:28,803
and addictions take away from it.

388
00:20:28,804 --> 00:20:34,958
I can see, theoretically, how people can be totally
hooked on the idea of wanting to be famous.

389
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:42,362
The younger you are, the more susceptible you
are to most types of addictive behaviour.

390
00:20:42,363 --> 00:20:47,315
The earlier that you start smoking,
having sex, drinking, gambling,

391
00:20:47,316 --> 00:20:50,835
you're more likely to have problems
with those behaviours later in life.

392
00:20:50,837 --> 00:20:55,194
The fruit machine is ideally designed to give
lots of what we call near-win experiences,

393
00:20:55,195 --> 00:20:58,434
so, psychologically, a gambler
does not constantly lose,

394
00:20:58,435 --> 00:21:00,405
a gambler constantly nearly wins.

395
00:21:00,998 --> 00:21:04,998
We aim to give you a near-win
experience as often as possible.

396
00:21:06,077 --> 00:21:09,213
We carefully select stories
of ordinary people

397
00:21:09,214 --> 00:21:13,214
who have hit the jackpot
and we give them blanket coverage,

398
00:21:13,614 --> 00:21:17,093
reinforcing the belief
that it could happen to you.

399
00:21:17,094 --> 00:21:17,572
Wesley Autrey.

400
00:21:17,573 --> 00:21:18,612
Wesley Autrey.

401
00:21:18,613 --> 00:21:19,774
Wesley Autrey.

402
00:21:19,775 --> 00:21:23,213
A 50-year-old American construction
worker is being hailed a hero.

403
00:21:23,214 --> 00:21:24,293
What's up?

404
00:21:24,294 --> 00:21:25,414
What's happening?

405
00:21:25,415 --> 00:21:27,533
I pretty much know everybody here.

406
00:21:27,534 --> 00:21:29,051
How you doing?

407
00:21:29,052 --> 00:21:31,217
Wesley Autrey saved a stranger

408
00:21:31,234 --> 00:21:33,857
who'd fallen off a subway platform

409
00:21:33,858 --> 00:21:35,817
by throwing himself on top,

410
00:21:35,818 --> 00:21:39,818
pinning him down and protecting him
from a passing train.

411
00:21:40,898 --> 00:21:44,898
So, they come in at about
50, 60 miles-an-hour.

412
00:21:46,253 --> 00:21:48,166
So, when you were approached by the media,

413
00:21:48,167 --> 00:21:50,088
did you say yes to every interview?

414
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:53,847
Well, I let my sister who was my
PR... More or less yes, yes, we did.

415
00:21:53,848 --> 00:21:56,647
That's the day it happened, January 2nd.

416
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,646
And then you met the mayor.

417
00:21:57,647 --> 00:21:58,806
The Mayor.

418
00:21:58,807 --> 00:21:59,406
Donald Trump.

419
00:21:59,407 --> 00:22:00,486
This is a brave man.

420
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:01,446
David Letterman.

421
00:22:01,447 --> 00:22:02,728
That was a big day.

422
00:22:02,729 --> 00:22:05,606
That was the night I was invited
to the State Of The Union.

423
00:22:05,607 --> 00:22:09,251
There is something wonderful about
a country that produces a brave

424
00:22:09,252 --> 00:22:11,895
and humble man, like Wesley Autrey.

425
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:13,940
This day was a very crazy day

426
00:22:13,941 --> 00:22:16,580
because Deal Or No Deal
wanted me on that day

427
00:22:16,581 --> 00:22:18,980
and Oprah wanted me on that day.

428
00:22:18,981 --> 00:22:22,981
That applause is almost better than what I got
at the State Of The Union. Thank you, guys.

429
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:25,500
And then Time Magazine.

430
00:22:25,501 --> 00:22:30,167
I was number 48 out of the most
influential people in the world.

431
00:22:30,175 --> 00:22:30,979
In the world?

432
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,021
In '07.

433
00:22:32,022 --> 00:22:34,780
Chrysler gave me that free jeep out there.

434
00:22:34,781 --> 00:22:35,499
Chrysler gave you a jeep?

435
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,341
Chrysler gave me a jeep
behind me saving Cameron.

436
00:22:38,342 --> 00:22:44,020
I would like to do a commercial for them
to let the world know that is a great jeep.

437
00:22:44,021 --> 00:22:49,364
I mean, not only is it economising,
good on gas, it's an excellent jeep.

438
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:54,979
Und Heute Abend ist er bei uns zu Gast,
der U-bahn Engel von New York, Wesley Autrey.

439
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,019
Suddenly... You're on every TV channel.

440
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,621
I'm on every TV channel.

441
00:22:57,622 --> 00:23:00,060
My name is like a household name
like Cornflakes.

442
00:23:00,061 --> 00:23:02,420
So I'm telling him "don't move".

443
00:23:02,421 --> 00:23:06,421
APPLAUSE

444
00:23:13,421 --> 00:23:16,420
Is it true you've done
over 2,000 interviews?

445
00:23:16,421 --> 00:23:17,715
Don't you ever get sick of it?

446
00:23:17,716 --> 00:23:18,987
No.

447
00:23:24,025 --> 00:23:25,503
So it's increasing your brand worldwide?

448
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:27,785
Exactly, exactly.

449
00:23:27,786 --> 00:23:29,224
Thank you, baby.

450
00:23:29,225 --> 00:23:33,225
If you stood for office in this ward,
in this council...

451
00:23:34,231 --> 00:23:36,495
you would get a landslide, wouldn't you?

452
00:23:36,496 --> 00:23:38,935
Yeah, that's what people tell me. They say,

453
00:23:38,936 --> 00:23:41,215
Yo, you have so many people loving you

454
00:23:41,216 --> 00:23:45,216
and you have some great qualities,
why don't you run for president,

455
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,638
for mayor, for governor?

456
00:23:47,639 --> 00:23:49,437
Do you think you've changed by...
Has it changed you?

457
00:23:49,438 --> 00:23:51,719
No, no, no.

458
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:56,118
Cos people said, "Don't let that change you,
don't let that money change you."

459
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:57,837
No, I don't think I've changed,

460
00:23:57,838 --> 00:24:00,227
I think it's the people around me
that have changed

461
00:24:00,228 --> 00:24:03,345
because I got friends
who think I should give them,

462
00:24:03,346 --> 00:24:06,956
I've got friends, like I said,
who think I'm already a millionaire

463
00:24:06,957 --> 00:24:09,907
and that I'm nowhere near yet.

464
00:24:11,787 --> 00:24:13,132
The kind of work that I've been doing,

465
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:16,011
I would actually say that people
who have become famous,

466
00:24:16,012 --> 00:24:19,211
that, in and of itself, can be
a potentially addictive activity.

467
00:24:20,797 --> 00:24:22,242
When they do achieve something,

468
00:24:22,243 --> 00:24:25,000
they get intense mood-modificating effects.

469
00:24:25,001 --> 00:24:27,013
They really do feel buzzed up and high

470
00:24:27,014 --> 00:24:30,853
when they've been on television, on radio
or they see their name in print.

471
00:24:30,855 --> 00:24:33,934
They're living on this oxygen of publicity.

472
00:24:33,935 --> 00:24:38,534
Who hasn't, among us,
had the sort of delicious experience

473
00:24:38,535 --> 00:24:41,134
of being at a cocktail party,
telling a good story,

474
00:24:41,135 --> 00:24:43,894
having everyone hanging on
our word and then laughing.

475
00:24:44,954 --> 00:24:47,090
There's not a lot better in life than that.

476
00:24:47,091 --> 00:24:51,091
If you could bottle that, you couldn't keep
it on the shelves. That's potent stuff.

477
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:54,214
Performing itself can produce a high

478
00:24:54,215 --> 00:24:58,174
and it's doing that through all the
same chemistry that cocaine works.

479
00:24:58,175 --> 00:25:03,289
Most addictions are about what we call the deficit
of a particular neurotransmitter called dopamine.

480
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,212
It's going to affect the catecholamines.

481
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:09,096
There's plasma changes that sort of
alters our chemistry a little bit

482
00:25:09,097 --> 00:25:11,936
and that really sets us up
to need more of it, really.

483
00:25:11,937 --> 00:25:14,511
The do-it-again part of our brain
is sort of activated.

484
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:16,111
There's more firing going off.

485
00:25:16,112 --> 00:25:20,112
And of course those euphoric chemicals like
endorphins are firing off in other areas.

486
00:25:21,105 --> 00:25:25,105
We create celebrities
by selecting the right candidates

487
00:25:25,143 --> 00:25:28,325
and relentlessly boosting their profile.

488
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:31,974
This gets them hooked
on positive attention.

489
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:34,737
And to keep you hooked on them,

490
00:25:34,738 --> 00:25:38,738
we sometimes need to change
the type of attention we give them.

491
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:44,777
When the terrorists tried to
attack Scotland's biggest airport,

492
00:25:44,778 --> 00:25:47,377
they were answered by
the courage of the police

493
00:25:47,378 --> 00:25:52,498
and of the fire fighters and a
baggage handler named John Smeaton.

494
00:25:53,806 --> 00:25:56,306
Local hero - the airport baggage handler

495
00:25:56,307 --> 00:25:59,586
who ignored the dangers
to tackle a suspected terrorist.

496
00:25:59,587 --> 00:26:01,306
We're under attack here.

497
00:26:01,307 --> 00:26:04,666
The British people have been under
a lot worse things than this,

498
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:05,970
and we always stand proud.

499
00:26:05,971 --> 00:26:09,970
This is Glasgow, you know, so,
we'll set about you.

500
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:15,689
A year ago, an unknown baggage
handler at Glasgow Airport,

501
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:19,690
today, receiving a medal
from Her Majesty the Queen.

502
00:26:25,527 --> 00:26:27,910
Fight on for freedom.

503
00:26:27,911 --> 00:26:31,096
Fight on for Scotland!

504
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,809
What we didn't headline
when the story broke

505
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:38,284
was that there were three other
less photogenic citizens

506
00:26:38,285 --> 00:26:41,644
who also bravely fought the terrorists.

507
00:26:41,645 --> 00:26:46,164
Nearly a year later, having received
hardly any media attention,

508
00:26:46,165 --> 00:26:47,844
they turned on Smeaton.

509
00:26:47,845 --> 00:26:51,845
And this time, we were
only too happy to help.

510
00:27:02,837 --> 00:27:06,439
And I'm like that.
Woah, stuck the heid back, foot oot.

511
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,199
It's almost instinctive...

512
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,118
Totally, you know, and it's like...

513
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:14,214
so you're saying I didnae do that, mate?

514
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,039
You know that, to me, is libel.

515
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,679
You know, to me that's libel but...

516
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,919
I'm a big man, I can take it,

517
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,919
I don't need to go and cry to newspapers
and take it to the courts and...

518
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,920
But when it's personal criticism,
something that's...

519
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,439
you know, it's overstepping the mark.

520
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,440
You know, that's when it hurts
and that's when you begin to say...

521
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,439
Bastards. Do you know what I mean?
But that's the nature of the beast.

522
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,079
That is the nature of the media.

523
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,958
There's no such thing as bad publicity.

524
00:27:45,959 --> 00:27:46,398
Do you believe that?

525
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:47,438
Aye.

526
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:48,120
You do?

527
00:27:48,121 --> 00:27:51,479
Oh, aye, you know?

528
00:27:51,495 --> 00:27:54,719
So, you'd rather have it with
all the nastiness than not have it?

529
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,221
Aye.

530
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,919
Is it the case that we are
putting a unique kind of person

531
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,879
up in celebrity status,
and if that's true, why?

532
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,639
What is it about us that we care
about these people? Why do we care?

533
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,559
These are sick people.
Why are we focused on them?

534
00:28:13,584 --> 00:28:20,335
Our entire global business is based on
understanding the answer to these questions.

535
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:25,419
In the previous lesson
you saw how a lucky few

536
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:28,579
can get trapped inside the spotlight.

537
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:33,535
Our third lesson is about your
irresistible attraction to them

538
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:37,550
and how we manipulate this for profit.

539
00:28:38,151 --> 00:28:41,710
Evolution can sometimes produce
hard-wired behaviour

540
00:28:41,712 --> 00:28:44,831
that generations later causes you problems,

541
00:28:44,832 --> 00:28:48,071
like moths flying into a light.

542
00:28:48,072 --> 00:28:51,951
Long ago, moths that instinctively
flew towards the moon

543
00:28:51,952 --> 00:28:55,952
were better at navigating
and this urge got handed down.

544
00:28:56,509 --> 00:28:59,972
Now, technology has changed
their surroundings

545
00:28:59,973 --> 00:29:03,381
and this instinct is more of a hindrance.

546
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:07,866
Darwinists believe that humans
also developed powerful urges

547
00:29:07,867 --> 00:29:10,739
that kept them alive in times gone by.

548
00:29:11,352 --> 00:29:14,351
Our brains are hard-wired
to make us social.

549
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:19,950
Very few people
can really tolerate social isolation

550
00:29:19,951 --> 00:29:21,790
for any length of time.

551
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:26,393
There is a theory that in the past,
there were two types of human.

552
00:29:26,394 --> 00:29:29,049
Those who naturally wanted to form groups,

553
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:31,297
and those who wanted to be alone.

554
00:29:32,141 --> 00:29:35,500
The team players were able to share tasks

555
00:29:35,502 --> 00:29:38,701
and so were able to survive
when times got tough,

556
00:29:39,782 --> 00:29:41,898
unlike the loners.

557
00:29:41,899 --> 00:29:45,657
So the survivors passed on the urge
to be part of a group,

558
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:48,640
that modern man has inherited.

559
00:29:48,641 --> 00:29:52,533
Some early humans
instinctively copied the successful,

560
00:29:53,323 --> 00:29:56,604
while others tried to learn alone.

561
00:29:57,455 --> 00:30:00,934
Well, it's not difficult to see
why those who copied the leader

562
00:30:00,935 --> 00:30:03,774
would stay ahead of the competition.

563
00:30:07,615 --> 00:30:09,308
TRUMPETING

564
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:11,628
This is your inheritance,

565
00:30:11,975 --> 00:30:13,629
making you naturally copy

566
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:16,948
whoever appears to be
the leader of your gang.

567
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:20,505
What if there was also an urge
to get as close as possible

568
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,730
to whoever you're told
is the most successful?

569
00:30:24,109 --> 00:30:28,897
This would have been good for women,
who would have got to mate with the top dog.

570
00:30:29,313 --> 00:30:31,604
And those men closest to the alpha male

571
00:30:31,605 --> 00:30:33,650
would have got to share his women,

572
00:30:33,651 --> 00:30:36,170
as well as any leftover food.

573
00:30:36,621 --> 00:30:40,423
Anyone who naturally
didn't want to join an entourage

574
00:30:40,424 --> 00:30:42,702
wasn't going to much reproducing.

575
00:30:42,703 --> 00:30:48,043
So it is possible that you have evolved
with an instinct to form groups,

576
00:30:48,786 --> 00:30:51,985
copy whoever appears to be successful,

577
00:30:51,986 --> 00:30:54,858
and to congregate around them.

578
00:30:56,065 --> 00:31:00,345
But then technology advanced
so quickly that it became possible

579
00:31:00,346 --> 00:31:04,346
to convince the mind
that a moving image is real.

580
00:31:05,767 --> 00:31:09,150
As soon as the trick was used
to entertain an audience,

581
00:31:09,151 --> 00:31:11,359
our industry was born.

582
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:14,163
By entertaining the world,

583
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:18,812
we were able to grow into powerful
and influential corporations.

584
00:31:21,104 --> 00:31:25,062
Now our reach is unparalleled

585
00:31:25,063 --> 00:31:28,230
and we deliver media to you
and your children,

586
00:31:28,231 --> 00:31:31,310
in ways that you cannot control.

587
00:31:32,834 --> 00:31:35,793
When we surround you with famous faces,

588
00:31:35,795 --> 00:31:39,889
your survival instincts kick in
and you feel the urge

589
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:42,289
to get up close and copy them.

590
00:31:43,226 --> 00:31:46,813
This has created a new social hierarchy,

591
00:31:46,814 --> 00:31:50,814
based around your proximity
to anyone well-known.

592
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,587
No, this is... this is... Oh, right.

593
00:31:56,588 --> 00:31:59,677
It feels miles away doesn't it?
Yeah. I know.

594
00:32:00,423 --> 00:32:01,546
We like to keep our distance.

595
00:32:01,547 --> 00:32:02,184
Yeah, absolutely.

596
00:32:02,185 --> 00:32:03,398
We don't know too much about you!

597
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:07,156
It's a bespoke private celebrity PA agency.

598
00:32:07,157 --> 00:32:09,105
What, attracted you to the advert?

599
00:32:09,106 --> 00:32:11,176
Why did you look at the ad and think,
"That's something I want to do"?

600
00:32:11,183 --> 00:32:14,918
Well, it's clearly simple,
it says "celebrity PA",

601
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:17,997
and they were looking for someone
in the industry

602
00:32:17,998 --> 00:32:20,436
who already understands
what that word means.

603
00:32:20,437 --> 00:32:21,676
Celebrity PA?

604
00:32:21,677 --> 00:32:23,269
Flexibility and motivation.

605
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:26,189
They're buying an assistant,
in a way, like a pet.

606
00:32:26,191 --> 00:32:27,671
And they can kick the pet?

607
00:32:27,672 --> 00:32:30,910
Well, unfortunately...
They shouldn't do that, but...

608
00:32:30,911 --> 00:32:31,991
Pets get kicked.

609
00:32:32,503 --> 00:32:36,221
I'd been working as an actor
for about a year, since leaving uni.

610
00:32:36,222 --> 00:32:39,141
I actually brought
a CV with me, just, uh...

611
00:32:39,142 --> 00:32:40,180
just for general interest, really.

612
00:32:40,181 --> 00:32:41,340
Yep, good.

613
00:32:41,341 --> 00:32:42,942
Slide it across there.

614
00:32:42,943 --> 00:32:46,553
I thought it would be far more
interesting to work in the industry.

615
00:32:46,554 --> 00:32:49,369
Let's say you're working for a...

616
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:53,370
very high profile celebrity whose
wife is, you know, getting on a bit,

617
00:32:53,691 --> 00:32:55,730
and he's having a series of affairs.

618
00:32:55,731 --> 00:32:57,369
What if one of the girls was 16?

619
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:58,609
That's not really a problem...

620
00:32:58,610 --> 00:32:59,719
15?

621
00:33:00,474 --> 00:33:04,032
To be honest, if a 15-year-old girl wants
to do that, she's going to do it anyway.

622
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:06,508
Good on her if she gets to do it
with a celebrity.

623
00:33:06,509 --> 00:33:08,868
You're quite young, got a social life.

624
00:33:08,869 --> 00:33:09,797
Would you be happy to give all that up?

625
00:33:09,798 --> 00:33:10,422
Yeah.

626
00:33:10,423 --> 00:33:11,863
Not see your friends or family?

627
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,151
Yeah, that'd be fine.

628
00:33:13,152 --> 00:33:14,632
They need five grams of coke.

629
00:33:15,216 --> 00:33:16,471
That's fine.

630
00:33:16,834 --> 00:33:18,993
If you drove,
would you break the speed limit?

631
00:33:19,907 --> 00:33:20,516
No.

632
00:33:20,546 --> 00:33:21,724
You wouldn't break the speed limit?

633
00:33:21,725 --> 00:33:22,554
I'd try not to.

634
00:33:22,555 --> 00:33:25,912
The rules are always to break them,
that's what the rule's for.

635
00:33:25,913 --> 00:33:28,192
You always have to break them!

636
00:33:28,193 --> 00:33:30,712
But I never drive, anyway, on the limit.

637
00:33:30,713 --> 00:33:34,184
What if they wanted to pay for sex
and said, "Find me a prostitute"?

638
00:33:34,185 --> 00:33:35,784
I would do that. I did that.

639
00:33:35,785 --> 00:33:37,418
I did that. I had to do that as well...

640
00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:39,136
Basically, this is your job, this is...

641
00:33:39,137 --> 00:33:40,618
Even if things were illegal or...?

642
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:43,337
Even. You just have to do it.

643
00:33:43,338 --> 00:33:48,256
You are the gatekeeper
to the celebrity's life.

644
00:33:48,257 --> 00:33:51,009
They have crazy people after them.

645
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:51,643
Wow.

646
00:33:51,644 --> 00:33:56,083
Like stalkers, psychos, nut nuts,
crack bags, the whole thing.

647
00:33:56,084 --> 00:33:57,601
I mean, would you...?

648
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:58,726
Would that worry you?

649
00:33:58,727 --> 00:34:01,717
No. I know it sounds
really weird, but, um...

650
00:34:02,256 --> 00:34:05,539
Do you ever get this feeling where you
just want a bit of adventure in your life?

651
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:05,944
Yeah, yeah.

652
00:34:05,945 --> 00:34:06,865
A bit like a movie.

653
00:34:06,866 --> 00:34:07,649
Yeah, yeah.

654
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:09,578
This all sounds fantastic to me.

655
00:34:09,579 --> 00:34:12,691
But you might end up taking a bullet for them.
Does that worry you?

656
00:34:12,692 --> 00:34:14,350
Surprisingly, no.

657
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,340
Stupid thing to say,

658
00:34:17,341 --> 00:34:21,340
I wouldn't mind taking a bullet
for someone I don't know, but...

659
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:24,579
That's the sort of adventure
and adrenaline I need in my life.

660
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,099
Nice to meet you.

661
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:26,940
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.

662
00:34:26,941 --> 00:34:28,717
Thank you, cheers.

663
00:34:30,241 --> 00:34:33,120
Again there's some interesting research
on this, they call the phenomenon

664
00:34:33,121 --> 00:34:35,160
"basking in reflected glory".

665
00:34:35,161 --> 00:34:38,240
In this study, students,
several hundred of them,

666
00:34:38,241 --> 00:34:42,000
read a short biography of Rasputin,

667
00:34:42,001 --> 00:34:45,120
you know, the villain of Russian history.

668
00:34:45,121 --> 00:34:47,360
For half of them, they customise the test

669
00:34:47,361 --> 00:34:50,840
so Rasputin had the same birthday
as you did, without you knowing,

670
00:34:50,841 --> 00:34:53,038
My birthday's July 28th,

671
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:56,836
so I'm reading it and Rasputin
was born July 28th whenever.

672
00:34:56,837 --> 00:35:02,077
The people that had the same birthday
as Rasputin were, across the board,

673
00:35:02,078 --> 00:35:06,092
more likely to say Rasputin
was a misunderstood man in history.

674
00:35:06,093 --> 00:35:09,652
He was notorious but he was great
and he played an important role

675
00:35:09,655 --> 00:35:11,534
and that shouldn't be forgotten.

676
00:35:11,535 --> 00:35:14,100
And this is just because
they share a birthday.

677
00:35:15,498 --> 00:35:19,817
The power of association with someone
who's famous, or even infamous,

678
00:35:19,818 --> 00:35:23,000
is far more potent than we even realise.

679
00:35:38,818 --> 00:35:41,177
Are you just taking one pair of shoes?

680
00:35:41,178 --> 00:35:43,537
Just these, or you want to
take some other...?

681
00:35:43,538 --> 00:35:46,337
Whatever's going to fit with that outfit.

682
00:35:46,338 --> 00:35:48,097
See, I wash all his shoes, man.

683
00:35:48,098 --> 00:35:49,777
Some of them are two years old,

684
00:35:49,778 --> 00:35:53,017
they look brand new
because every night I clean them.

685
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:55,137
That's the military in me.

686
00:35:55,138 --> 00:35:58,137
And sometimes we argue
about what we're wearing!

687
00:35:58,138 --> 00:36:01,617
(MAN) But who's the commander
of the outfit?

688
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:04,497
He likes to say that it's him.

689
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:06,137
But it's always my wife.

690
00:36:06,138 --> 00:36:08,577
I'll kind of draw from other celebrities.

691
00:36:08,578 --> 00:36:11,097
I was trying to do something
LL Cool J-style,

692
00:36:11,098 --> 00:36:13,537
like, with a tracksuit and track pants.

693
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:15,697
It's Chet Buchanan The Morning Zoo.

694
00:36:15,698 --> 00:36:16,498
Give it to me.

695
00:36:16,499 --> 00:36:18,416
On 98.5 KLUC.

696
00:36:18,417 --> 00:36:21,372
Spence, while you're up,
would you please let in our guest?

697
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:21,975
Yes sir.

698
00:36:21,977 --> 00:36:23,936
(MAN) So he's got his own
little slot on a radio show?

699
00:36:23,937 --> 00:36:25,658
Yeah, he's doing the NFL season

700
00:36:25,659 --> 00:36:28,417
and it's on the biggest
radio station in Vegas.

701
00:36:28,418 --> 00:36:30,657
Where did the other mic go?

702
00:36:30,658 --> 00:36:33,417
That's cos it's down near the floor,
where the little fella is!

703
00:36:33,418 --> 00:36:35,018
No, it's not.

704
00:36:35,019 --> 00:36:36,337
What's up, buddy?

705
00:36:36,338 --> 00:36:37,578
Hey.

706
00:36:37,579 --> 00:36:40,217
Ri-yan didn't have school today,
so he came in.

707
00:36:40,218 --> 00:36:41,656
If you want to make money,

708
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:43,735
are you taking Cincinnati
or the Dallas Cowboys?

709
00:36:43,736 --> 00:36:44,714
Dallas Cowboys!

710
00:36:44,715 --> 00:36:48,538
Take it all to the bank and come back and
see us on Monday, that's what I'm saying.

711
00:36:48,836 --> 00:36:51,714
I don't know as he gets older,
he'll say, this is a big deal,

712
00:36:51,715 --> 00:36:55,045
I'm on the radio and I'm talking to
hundreds of thousands of people, you know.

713
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,200
They are listening to me.

714
00:36:56,201 --> 00:36:58,994
What if he just doesn't understand
how important it is.

715
00:36:58,995 --> 00:37:00,776
So far it hasn't fazed him.

716
00:37:00,794 --> 00:37:02,919
You got slaughtered last weekend!

717
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:03,677
Yes, I did.

718
00:37:03,678 --> 00:37:07,389
We keep throwing him in
more and more of these situations.

719
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:09,069
Right now, we try everything.

720
00:37:09,855 --> 00:37:11,614
It was nice to see you, Ri-yan.

721
00:37:11,615 --> 00:37:13,934
Nice meeting you, Ri-yan.

722
00:37:13,935 --> 00:37:16,614
Great meeting you.

723
00:37:16,615 --> 00:37:18,575
He'll be DJ-ing throughout the day.

724
00:37:18,576 --> 00:37:21,854
APPLAUSE

725
00:37:21,855 --> 00:37:23,093
I'm running the bookie.

726
00:37:23,094 --> 00:37:24,535
The bookie!

727
00:37:24,536 --> 00:37:25,854
(CROWD) Woah!

728
00:37:25,855 --> 00:37:28,854
I don't want no problems!
Why do they call you the bookie?

729
00:37:28,855 --> 00:37:34,004
Because I've been collecting money
and I've been breaking some heads.

730
00:37:34,005 --> 00:37:35,644
Breaking some heads!

731
00:37:35,645 --> 00:37:38,804
I'm going to buy a car here.

732
00:37:38,805 --> 00:37:42,404
That's another show, it's an
info-commercial, but it's run, like,

733
00:37:42,405 --> 00:37:45,404
ten times a weekend
on different channels in town,

734
00:37:45,405 --> 00:37:47,883
so his exposure, people see him.

735
00:37:47,884 --> 00:37:50,443
Let's make some noise for my boy, Ri-yan!

736
00:37:50,444 --> 00:37:51,040
CHEERING

737
00:37:51,041 --> 00:37:52,841
He also does like promos at different bars.

738
00:37:52,842 --> 00:37:54,561
People have football parties,

739
00:37:54,562 --> 00:37:57,761
he has his own booth
and he has his own fan base.

740
00:37:57,762 --> 00:37:59,162
You've got your own fan base?

741
00:37:59,163 --> 00:38:03,162
You've got your own fan base? Yeah.

742
00:38:03,321 --> 00:38:06,523
Ye-e-ah!

743
00:38:17,042 --> 00:38:19,721
(WOMAN) Ri-yan just made parole.

744
00:38:19,722 --> 00:38:23,613
As his, you know, success progresses

745
00:38:23,614 --> 00:38:27,614
we're going to have to be more
aware, more, way more aware

746
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:30,173
of who we speak to about him.

747
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:32,576
We still do what we got to do, you know.

748
00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:33,758
They can't stop us.

749
00:38:33,759 --> 00:38:34,060
Yeah.

750
00:38:34,066 --> 00:38:36,839
We can't be, you know, afraid...

751
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,158
We'll be stuck in the house all the time.

752
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,159
We don't live our life that way.

753
00:38:41,708 --> 00:38:45,028
No matter how many celebrities we create,

754
00:38:45,029 --> 00:38:49,029
it's never going to be possible
for everybody to join an entourage.

755
00:38:50,306 --> 00:38:53,905
But there are other ways
we can exploit your need

756
00:38:53,906 --> 00:38:55,905
to be close to the famous,

757
00:38:55,906 --> 00:38:59,258
all from the comfort
of your own living room.

758
00:39:00,613 --> 00:39:04,613
Television probably played
the biggest part here,

759
00:39:05,418 --> 00:39:09,418
because with television,
there's an illusion of intimacy

760
00:39:09,871 --> 00:39:13,530
and that visual image, now quite realistic,

761
00:39:13,531 --> 00:39:15,875
can be right in one's home,

762
00:39:16,507 --> 00:39:20,507
giving us the illusion that
we actually know these people.

763
00:39:20,601 --> 00:39:24,601
There is no way evolution could have
anticipated the internet!

764
00:39:26,967 --> 00:39:31,737
And therefore, we are stuck
with a kind of brain machinery

765
00:39:31,738 --> 00:39:34,727
which was designed to handle
face-to-face interactions.

766
00:39:34,728 --> 00:39:39,472
It was not designed
to handle virtual interactions.

767
00:39:42,488 --> 00:39:45,207
It is a brave new world
from that point of view

768
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:48,367
and that does mean
it's easily exploited by people

769
00:39:48,368 --> 00:39:54,488
who can figure out how to use
that medium to their advantage.

770
00:39:55,105 --> 00:39:58,003
A para-social relationship
is one of those awful technical terms

771
00:39:58,004 --> 00:39:59,884
which sounds more fancy than it is.

772
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:03,683
It simply means that you have
a relationship with somebody

773
00:40:03,684 --> 00:40:06,563
which is not based upon
a face-to-face relationship,

774
00:40:06,564 --> 00:40:10,071
it's based upon what you know
about that person through the press,

775
00:40:10,072 --> 00:40:13,071
what you know about that person
through watching him or her on TV

776
00:40:13,072 --> 00:40:15,991
despite the fact that you
never actually meet the celebrity.

777
00:40:16,565 --> 00:40:20,753
I say to my students that
the only example that I know of

778
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:23,433
where people have this
deep emotional attachment

779
00:40:23,434 --> 00:40:25,113
to someone they've never met

780
00:40:25,114 --> 00:40:27,833
is the attachment
that some people have to God.

781
00:40:27,849 --> 00:40:31,048
But the para-social relationship
is created by the media,

782
00:40:31,463 --> 00:40:33,396
fuelled by the media.

783
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:34,637
And we all do it?

784
00:40:34,638 --> 00:40:36,337
We all do it, yes.

785
00:40:38,397 --> 00:40:42,385
CROWD CHANTS

786
00:40:42,386 --> 00:40:44,545
The more celebrities we create,

787
00:40:44,546 --> 00:40:48,066
the more we can capitalise on these bonds.

788
00:40:49,224 --> 00:40:51,995
And the younger
these relationships are formed,

789
00:40:51,996 --> 00:40:53,955
the stronger they're going to be.

790
00:40:54,617 --> 00:40:57,096
Her whole bedroom has posters of Zac Efron!

791
00:40:57,098 --> 00:40:58,419
Zac Efron!

792
00:41:01,578 --> 00:41:05,578
CROWD SCREAMS

793
00:41:07,662 --> 00:41:09,924
I think there's some things
that celebrities do

794
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:13,925
that play right into this trick of the box.

795
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:18,429
Pretending it's a two-way relationship,

796
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,109
I think, enhances this.

797
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,548
Yeah, I feel like
there's a connection there.

798
00:41:21,549 --> 00:41:23,630
Yeah. And he loves me!

799
00:41:23,631 --> 00:41:25,869
There is this terrifying prospect I have

800
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:28,509
that it is actually replacing what
we used to call real life,

801
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:32,296
that people are developing stronger
imaginary relationships

802
00:41:32,297 --> 00:41:35,336
with people who are themselves
imaginary constructions,

803
00:41:35,338 --> 00:41:37,209
people who are not real.

804
00:41:38,758 --> 00:41:42,758
And our purpose in encouraging you
to make one-way friendships?

805
00:41:42,957 --> 00:41:46,395
It's simple - to make you buy stuff.

806
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:51,341
Your urge to copy the famous
influences your spending,

807
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,779
whether you like it or not.

808
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,779
See how easy it is to keep a man happy?

809
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,418
Why not give your husband
a carton of Philip Morris cigarettes.

810
00:41:58,419 --> 00:42:00,958
Delivers flavour, 20 times a pack.

811
00:42:00,959 --> 00:42:02,757
When it's tougher than ever
to be a tiger...

812
00:42:02,758 --> 00:42:05,516
Success is down to finding
people like this...

813
00:42:05,518 --> 00:42:06,417
Now for the good bit...

814
00:42:06,418 --> 00:42:07,437
if you have a debt problem...

815
00:42:07,438 --> 00:42:09,231
...and a prudent approach to banking...

816
00:42:09,232 --> 00:42:10,511
...you could borrow anything...

817
00:42:10,512 --> 00:42:12,351
...three and a half times your salary...

818
00:42:12,352 --> 00:42:13,511
A million pounds...

819
00:42:13,512 --> 00:42:14,918
...as long as you keep paying
the premium...

820
00:42:14,919 --> 00:42:16,359
Is that too much to ask?

821
00:42:16,361 --> 00:42:18,438
It's going to cost a pigging
fortune, this lot!

822
00:42:18,439 --> 00:42:19,406
Don't treat me like an idiot...

823
00:42:19,407 --> 00:42:21,905
Do you have advice for young people
who drive?

824
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:25,425
Take it easy driving. The life
you might save might be mine.

825
00:42:25,427 --> 00:42:28,906
Celebrity endorsement works
on an emotional level.

826
00:42:28,907 --> 00:42:34,648
We process emotions and we process rational
thought in different parts of the brain.

827
00:42:34,649 --> 00:42:38,786
So the limbic system, which is the
very old part of the brain that says,

828
00:42:38,787 --> 00:42:39,905
"Lion on the savannah, ..."

829
00:42:39,906 --> 00:42:40,947
"Lion on the savannah, ..." LION ROARS

830
00:42:40,948 --> 00:42:42,145
"..run away!"

831
00:42:42,146 --> 00:42:46,814
That's where we process things on
an emotional, almost gut-feel level.

832
00:42:47,003 --> 00:42:49,651
Imagine a horse and a rider.

833
00:42:49,652 --> 00:42:54,104
That piece of the brain is like
the horse, just working away.

834
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:58,688
And that's where we make decisions
and do maths and use spreadsheets.

835
00:42:58,689 --> 00:43:01,864
We try to control the more
instinctive parts of our brains,

836
00:43:01,865 --> 00:43:06,384
that's like the rider. But sometimes
the rider loses control of the horse.

837
00:43:06,385 --> 00:43:08,264
It's been shown in experiments.

838
00:43:08,265 --> 00:43:11,783
If you ask people, "Would you like
fruit salad or chocolate cake?"

839
00:43:11,784 --> 00:43:15,992
People will go, "I should take the fruit salad,
because that's the sensible thing to do."

840
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:17,304
So they'll take the fruit salad.

841
00:43:17,305 --> 00:43:21,350
But if you give them a really difficult task to
do beforehand, so they're mentally exhausted,

842
00:43:21,351 --> 00:43:24,473
they'll go for the chocolate cake,
because that's their instinct.

843
00:43:24,474 --> 00:43:29,773
And that's how it seems to be with a lot of
emotional advertising that's not well-labelled.

844
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:33,213
We just process it instinctively.

845
00:43:33,897 --> 00:43:36,566
These forms of advertising
are most effective

846
00:43:36,567 --> 00:43:39,983
when you're not even aware
that you're being sold to.

847
00:43:40,395 --> 00:43:43,354
This is Hannah Montana.
It's time to wake up!

848
00:43:43,355 --> 00:43:45,906
Seriously, it is!
You know what else is serious?

849
00:43:45,907 --> 00:43:47,101
Back to school shopping!

850
00:43:47,102 --> 00:43:49,063
So gather your list of school supplies.

851
00:43:49,064 --> 00:43:53,052
And don't forget Walmart has Hannah Montana
gear, the fashion and the music you love.

852
00:43:53,053 --> 00:43:56,933
Be a superstar yourself and get
your things together. And have fun!

853
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:58,903
Good luck this year at school.

854
00:44:00,144 --> 00:44:02,782
Children up to the age
of eight, nine and ten

855
00:44:02,783 --> 00:44:06,022
don't really understand the persuasive
intent of advertisements.

856
00:44:06,024 --> 00:44:08,661
There are people in there
trying to sell you something.

857
00:44:08,662 --> 00:44:14,062
I've no doubt our society would be much better
if there was a total ban on advertising

858
00:44:14,063 --> 00:44:19,743
for any child under 12, and really
limiting advertising towards teenagers.

859
00:44:19,744 --> 00:44:23,405
It's possible that there is a link
between increasing materialism

860
00:44:23,406 --> 00:44:27,593
and the mental health problems that an
increasing number of our children show.

861
00:44:27,594 --> 00:44:29,952
In the last ten years,
something has shifted.

862
00:44:29,953 --> 00:44:32,472
The number of young people
now that say a good life

863
00:44:32,473 --> 00:44:35,592
is about money, fame, appearance,

864
00:44:35,593 --> 00:44:37,990
has shot up dramatically.

865
00:44:37,991 --> 00:44:41,098
That's what our young people
believe, and why wouldn't they?

866
00:44:41,099 --> 00:44:45,099
Because that's the value system that
they're picking up from the media.

867
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:49,956
The media do not want to hear this message.

868
00:44:49,957 --> 00:44:53,435
It is not in their interest
for people to be saying

869
00:44:53,436 --> 00:44:58,190
that part of the problem with well-being, or
confidence or whatever, might be the media.

870
00:44:59,643 --> 00:45:02,202
And that one of the best
and easiest ways for people

871
00:45:02,203 --> 00:45:04,522
to actually look after their mental health

872
00:45:04,523 --> 00:45:07,481
is to cut down on media consumption.

873
00:45:07,482 --> 00:45:09,503
They don't like it.

874
00:45:11,483 --> 00:45:15,682
As we set the public agenda,
we'll avoid giving exposure

875
00:45:15,683 --> 00:45:20,097
to anything that will discourage
you wanting more of our product.

876
00:45:25,322 --> 00:45:29,322
By attaching a product
to a familiar and likeable face,

877
00:45:29,431 --> 00:45:33,310
we've developed an unstoppable means
of making you spend

878
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:37,311
what you don't have
on things you don't need.

879
00:45:38,231 --> 00:45:42,231
Most people will say that
these tricks don't affect them,

880
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:45,216
but that makes the tricks even more potent.

881
00:45:45,217 --> 00:45:49,217
How can you fight something
if you don't believe it exists?

882
00:45:50,172 --> 00:45:54,172
So strong are these bonds
that every piece of information

883
00:45:54,235 --> 00:45:57,833
about our celebrities is valuable to you.

884
00:45:57,834 --> 00:46:01,545
When we insert famous faces
into your eyeline,

885
00:46:01,546 --> 00:46:04,225
you're guaranteed to stop and look.

886
00:46:04,226 --> 00:46:06,425
The need to gather social information

887
00:46:06,426 --> 00:46:10,118
about the people we perceive
as influential and powerful

888
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:12,558
is something that is embedded
deep within us.

889
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:16,280
There are some studies that have been done
at Duke University on Rhesus monkeys.

890
00:46:16,281 --> 00:46:19,960
They can do one of two things. They
have a device hooked up to the eyes,

891
00:46:19,961 --> 00:46:22,555
so people can see which way
the monkey's looking at.

892
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:25,970
And if they look at one screen,
they get a squirt of juicy juice

893
00:46:25,971 --> 00:46:28,170
which is, you know, payment, reward.

894
00:46:28,171 --> 00:46:31,610
Or they can look at another screen
and see a series of pictures.
