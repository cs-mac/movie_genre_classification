1
00:00:55,975 --> 00:01:02,926
SEVEN YEARS IN TIBET

2
00:02:32,655 --> 00:02:36,045
Ku-Dun...

1
00:02:56,388 --> 00:02:58,146
Why must you be this way?

2
00:02:58,306 --> 00:03:01,408
Why is there always a problem?
It's a good question.

3
00:03:03,198 --> 00:03:05,020
Do you want to go home?
Do you want to turn around?

4
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,280
- Yes!
- It's the Himalayas!

5
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,997
How long have I been talking
about the Himalayas?

6
00:03:10,997 --> 00:03:13,171
- How long?
- Far too long.

7
00:03:14,386 --> 00:03:17,966
Horst, when we get there,
can you give me a hand, please?

8
00:03:18,063 --> 00:03:20,972
- Yes, of course.
- Ingrid, stop it.

9
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,910
Let's try to make the best of this.

10
00:03:44,404 --> 00:03:46,387
Where's thls idiot
who's supposed to meet us?

11
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,392
Move!

12
00:03:53,421 --> 00:03:54,601
Mr. Harrer.

13
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:56,328
I have your tickets.

14
00:03:56,361 --> 00:04:00,038
- I'm late. Take me to my train.
- No, you don't understand.

15
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:03,394
I am Peter Aufschnaiter.
I am leading the expedition.

16
00:04:03,394 --> 00:04:05,440
- How do you do?
- Here's our celebrity!

17
00:04:05,631 --> 00:04:07,422
Mr. Harrer?

18
00:04:07,422 --> 00:04:11,258
May I say, Mr. Harrer,
on behalf of the Reichssportsfuhrer...

19
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:14,422
we are honored to have
such a great German hero on the team.

20
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,917
Thank you, but I'm Austrian.

21
00:04:16,917 --> 00:04:19,282
Yes. but I'm sure that

22
00:04:19,282 --> 00:04:22,222
of the National Soclalist Party,
you would be proud to plant...

23
00:04:22,222 --> 00:04:26,955
our country's flag on the summit
of Nanga Parbat when you reach it.

24
00:04:27,113 --> 00:04:28,968
Hans Lobenhoffer.

25
00:04:29,095 --> 00:04:30,566
Lutz Chicken.

26
00:04:33,412 --> 00:04:35,969
And a picture with your lovely wife.

27
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,434
And Mr.--

28
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:44,312
Horst lmmendorf. Family frlend.
No plcture necessary.

29
00:04:47,605 --> 00:04:49,460
When is the little one due.

30
00:04:49,619 --> 00:04:51,953
About the time my husband
reaches the base camp.

31
00:04:53,456 --> 00:04:55,725
Thank you.

32
00:04:55,757 --> 00:04:58,315
Why don't you tell the entire
stinking country our troubles?

33
00:04:59,977 --> 00:05:02,311
I'm getting on that traln.
Do you have anything you want to say?

34
00:05:06,211 --> 00:05:07,106
Fine.

35
00:05:08,386 --> 00:05:10,207
Go. Leave.

36
00:05:11,998 --> 00:05:14,428
I'll see you in four months.

37
00:05:16,281 --> 00:05:18,423
- Take good care of her, Horst.
- I will. Heinrich .

38
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:39,014
We will travel 5,000 miles.

39
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:41,604
When we reach lndia,
we will head for the Hlmalayas...

40
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:44,513
and the ninth highest peak
on Earth, Nanga Parbat.

41
00:06:44,641 --> 00:06:47,903
Germany calls it "Unserberg--
Our Mountain. "

42
00:06:49,085 --> 00:06:51,930
Before us, four German expeditions
attempted it.

43
00:06:51,962 --> 00:06:53,528
All failed.

44
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:57,076
Eleven climbers were killed
in storms and avalanches.

45
00:06:57,172 --> 00:07:01,584
By now, the conquest of Nanga Parbat
is a national obsession--

46
00:07:01,648 --> 00:07:03,982
a matter of German pride.

47
00:07:09,097 --> 00:07:11,430
July 29, 1939.

48
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:15,202
We have already made Camp Four
at 22.000 feet.

49
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:20,062
Overhead is the Reklak Glacier
and a difficult climb up the icefall.

50
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:25,625
The baby must be
at least one month old now.

51
00:07:27,191 --> 00:07:30,356
I have been
so confused and dlstracted.

52
00:07:30,356 --> 00:07:33,041
I can 't climb
with my usual confldence.

53
00:07:58,584 --> 00:08:00,725
Are you all right?

54
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:07,375
Shit!

55
00:08:09,036 --> 00:08:12,618
- Are you al I right?
- Shall we come down?

56
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,516
Lost a crampon !

57
00:08:16,612 --> 00:08:18,148
Go ahead!

58
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:42,411
The weather's getting bad.
We should rope up.

59
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:49,253
- Did you hurt yourself back there?
- Just a scratch. I'll lead.

60
00:09:17,609 --> 00:09:19,400
Rocks!

61
00:09:19,527 --> 00:09:21,765
Look out below!

62
00:09:29,662 --> 00:09:31,962
Hold me!

63
00:09:44,015 --> 00:09:45,899
Have you got me?

64
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,354
Hold me!

65
00:10:55,751 --> 00:10:58,053
You should have told me
how bad that wound was.

66
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,505
I should take a look at lt.
I could sew it up.

67
00:11:06,334 --> 00:11:08,092
It's not your problem.

68
00:11:10,968 --> 00:11:12,758
Actually, it is my problem.

69
00:11:12,854 --> 00:11:15,732
- It's my life.
- What?

70
00:11:15,955 --> 00:11:19,408
When you conceal a serious injury
and put my life at risk...

71
00:11:19,504 --> 00:11:21,423
I consider th at my problem.

72
00:11:21,423 --> 00:11:24,363
No, you put your life at rlsk.
I saved it, so shut up !

73
00:11:24,394 --> 00:11:26,601
Please, it is not your place--

74
00:11:26,601 --> 00:11:28,072
Shut up !

75
00:11:29,831 --> 00:11:32,452
The next time you lle
about an lnjury, Heinrich...

76
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,264
you're off the team.

77
00:11:38,461 --> 00:11:40,219
Try it.

78
00:12:57,422 --> 00:13:00,970
August 4th, Camp Five.
Some fierce storms have passed.

79
00:13:01,034 --> 00:13:03,913
My teammates are nervous
about the avalanches...

80
00:13:03,977 --> 00:13:06,310
so we 've been holed up for days.

81
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:10,433
Aufschnalter should take advantage of
this lowland weather to make high camp.

82
00:13:10,593 --> 00:13:13,982
But he disagrees with me. Fool.

83
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:18,874
It seems the others don 't mind
sitting here waiting...

84
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:21,655
hoping, doing nothing.

85
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:26,256
So much time to question
one 's self is not good.

86
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:31,531
I am beginnlng to think
this whole expedition was a mistake.

87
00:13:49,403 --> 00:13:51,258
Run ! Avalanche! Get out!

88
00:13:56,116 --> 00:13:57,300
Leave everything!

89
00:14:11,428 --> 00:14:13,316
Put that down !

90
00:14:14,626 --> 00:14:16,159
We are going down now!

91
00:14:16,287 --> 00:14:18,975
If they're frightened of a storm,
send them down to Camp Two.

92
00:14:19,038 --> 00:14:22,202
I could summit on my own !
Always give the best man his shot!

93
00:14:22,331 --> 00:14:24,728
He's trying to tell us
he's the best man.

94
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:26,902
Give me two Sherpas.
I can make Camp Six by tonight...

95
00:14:27,062 --> 00:14:28,820
and my final attack tomorrow!

96
00:14:28,948 --> 00:14:31,727
- We are going down now as a team!
- I've earned that peak!

97
00:14:31,825 --> 00:14:33,615
- I want th at peak!
- As a team! That's an order!

98
00:14:33,744 --> 00:14:37,132
That is an order! An order!

99
00:14:38,283 --> 00:14:39,753
Follow me!

100
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:42,538
Dalai Lama photo. Good protection.

101
00:15:42,602 --> 00:15:45,415
Take it. Si Hib.

102
00:15:45,415 --> 00:15:48,612
No, that means nothing to me.

103
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:51,266
Dalai Lama. Dalai Lama photo.

104
00:15:51,331 --> 00:15:52,992
Si Hib, take it.

105
00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:54,879
Good protection for you.

106
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:10,606
Good afternoon, Herr Harrer.

107
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,717
Well, let's hope that Germany
retreats from Poland...

108
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,858
as quickly as you did
from your mountain.

109
00:16:14,955 --> 00:16:17,319
It might save you some prison time.

110
00:16:18,951 --> 00:16:20,933
What is this? Who are you?

111
00:16:20,965 --> 00:16:25,761
- I'm sorry, but you're under arrest.
- What charge? Failure to summit?

112
00:16:25,824 --> 00:16:27,294
I'm afraid not.

113
00:16:28,413 --> 00:16:32,313
You see, war has been declared between
Hls Majesty's Government and Germany.

114
00:16:32,439 --> 00:16:37,269
So all enemy aliens on British Empire
soil are now prisoners of war.

115
00:17:19,243 --> 00:17:22,088
- Stop, or I'll shoot!
- Hands up!

116
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:24,708
No, you don't understand!
I'm Austrian ! I'm a cllmber!

117
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,873
I have nothing to do
with your silly war!

118
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:36,601
I can walk myself.
This is an insult!

119
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,333
You think you have the last word,
but you don't!

120
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:43,986
Pigs! All of you, pigs!

121
00:17:56,965 --> 00:17:58,787
October 15, 1939.

122
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:04,255
Reaching prison camp,
I make a promise to myself.

123
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:10,103
I will be lying beside lngrid before
the summer solstice of the new year.

124
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:14,291
The Hlmalayas are right in front of us.

125
00:18:14,418 --> 00:18:17,168
It will be easy to escape
and get lost in them.

126
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:32,993
My fourth escape attempt
brings me no closer to my goal.

127
00:18:33,985 --> 00:18:36,318
How far did you get this time?

128
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:40,186
All I have achieved is a certaln
dubious celebrity among the prisoners.

129
00:19:03,971 --> 00:19:07,647
If only my hand could express
what is ln my heart.

130
00:19:21,584 --> 00:19:23,757
I hear the guards
are mailing letters for you.

131
00:19:24,972 --> 00:19:26,092
Yes.

132
00:19:26,156 --> 00:19:28,394
Would you mail these?

133
00:19:30,951 --> 00:19:33,254
Thank you.

134
00:19:33,254 --> 00:19:35,587
Hey, Heinrich, have you read this book?

135
00:19:35,651 --> 00:19:37,919
It was checked out to you.

136
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,751
- We need to talk to you.
- What about?

137
00:19:45,846 --> 00:19:47,286
About this.

138
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:58,219
Impressive. When do you plan to leave?

139
00:19:58,219 --> 00:20:00,202
After monsoon season. And you?

140
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,830
I see you've chosen
my route through Tibet.

141
00:20:05,989 --> 00:20:09,729
The few foreigners who have tried
never came back. So, good luck.

142
00:20:09,794 --> 00:20:12,925
- Would you like to come with us?
- Why?

143
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:16,058
After all, you are the authority
on jailbreak around here.

144
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,607
- We could benefit from your experience.
- Please.

145
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,282
Stop this embarrassing charade.

146
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:28,335
Every time you escape,
the patrols are doubled and tripled.

147
00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:31,531
It is making life very difficult
for the rest of us.

148
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,601
I prefer to travel on my own,
but thanks for thinking of me.

149
00:20:42,944 --> 00:20:44,734
The mailman has come.

150
00:21:21,978 --> 00:21:23,415
Dear Heinrlch:

151
00:21:23,608 --> 00:21:27,189
Please sign the enclosed dlvorce papers
and send them to my lawyer.

152
00:21:27,189 --> 00:21:31,056
Horst and I intend to be married
as soon as the divorce is flnalized.

153
00:21:31,088 --> 00:21:32,973
As for your letter, yes.

154
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,842
Your son, Rolf Harrer, was born
while you were climbing the mountain.

155
00:21:36,939 --> 00:21:40,710
He is now two years old
and calls Horst "papa. "

156
00:21:40,774 --> 00:21:42,852
When he is old enough,
I will tell him...

157
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:45,441
his real father was lost
in the Himalayas.

158
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:47,519
It seems the kindest thing
to say consldering...

159
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:49,950
you never wanted the child anyway.

160
00:21:50,014 --> 00:21:52,442
Needless to say,
I have no intention...

161
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:56,117
of "resolving our differences "
as you suggested.

162
00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:59,508
They were resolved
the moment you left Austria.

163
00:21:59,571 --> 00:22:02,640
I'm sorry you have been
imprisoned ln lndia...

164
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,733
and hope this dreadful war will soon
be over for everyone's sake.

165
00:22:06,764 --> 00:22:08,298
Ingrid.

166
00:23:32,854 --> 00:23:34,101
I'm coming with you.

167
00:23:42,605 --> 00:23:43,916
This is your plan?

168
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:50,759
In my humble opinion,
this is ridiculous.

169
00:23:50,854 --> 00:23:53,634
Then since you are so humble,
we won't ask your opinion.

170
00:24:37,431 --> 00:24:39,507
Open the charts. Turn around.

171
00:24:39,572 --> 00:24:43,376
Keep your back to the gate.
Open the charts!

172
00:24:57,986 --> 00:25:01,055
Keep talking. Wait for my signal.

173
00:25:02,205 --> 00:25:04,125
We are clear. Okay.

174
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:18,542
Open the gates!

175
00:25:25,831 --> 00:25:29,252
See to this. Open the gates!

176
00:26:03,072 --> 00:26:04,992
I'm going off on my own.

177
00:26:05,056 --> 00:26:06,974
So, good luck.

178
00:26:41,115 --> 00:26:46,773
First escape from prlson camp,
November 18, 1939.

179
00:26:46,869 --> 00:26:49,844
Rolf Harrer--
three and a half months old.

180
00:26:51,984 --> 00:26:55,917
My 30th birthday, July 6, 1941.

181
00:26:55,982 --> 00:27:00,615
Rolf Harrer-- exactly one year,
11 months and 26 days.

182
00:27:02,917 --> 00:27:06,211
Last escape from Dehra Dun.
Rolf Harrer--

183
00:29:28,373 --> 00:29:32,464
Take two and sleep it off.
I'll send you a bill in the morning.

184
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:38,156
What are you doing here?

185
00:29:38,315 --> 00:29:43,269
I missed you so much.
I thought I'd pay you a visit.

186
00:29:46,978 --> 00:29:49,408
What about the others?

187
00:29:49,441 --> 00:29:51,997
The ltalians were caught
outside Nelang.

188
00:29:52,061 --> 00:29:55,002
Lutz and Hans got sick
and had to turn back.

189
00:29:56,985 --> 00:29:59,765
- Sorry to hear that.
- I'm sure you're heartbroken.

190
00:30:02,292 --> 00:30:06,160
May I impose upon your generous nature
and camp here tonight?

191
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,078
Be my guest.

192
00:30:08,205 --> 00:30:11,243
Thank you.
It is very gracious of you.

193
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:32,692
- Good.
- What else do you have in there?

194
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,931
A ten-piece orchestra?

195
00:30:35,027 --> 00:30:39,214
By the way, I heard
the Japanese have retreated...

196
00:30:39,245 --> 00:30:43,082
all the way back to Shanghai so even
if you make it to the Chinese border...

197
00:30:43,082 --> 00:30:45,127
you may have dlfficulty
catchlng up with them.

198
00:30:45,127 --> 00:30:47,653
I don 't care if they're repelled
all the way back to Tokyo.

199
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,733
You should if you want
to get back to Austria.

200
00:30:50,659 --> 00:30:52,609
- But I don't.
- Don't what?

201
00:30:54,943 --> 00:30:57,435
- Plan to go back.
- Why not?

202
00:31:00,632 --> 00:31:03,381
No particular reason.

203
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:05,268
When you get there, tell my wife...

204
00:31:05,268 --> 00:31:09,200
that two years in prison camp is roughly
equivalent to four years of marriage.

205
00:31:09,296 --> 00:31:11,663
And I'm glad to be free of them both.

206
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:18,631
I'm not golng back either,
not until this shameful war is over.

207
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:21,319
- And where are you headed?
- Tibet.

208
00:31:21,382 --> 00:31:25,792
Then on to China.

209
00:31:26,943 --> 00:31:28,190
And you ?

210
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:32,664
By my calculations, the Chinese border
is 2,058 kilometers away.

211
00:31:32,664 --> 00:31:35,096
Tibet is 68.

212
00:31:35,191 --> 00:31:39,091
It's a long way to travel
with such a heavy load.

213
00:31:40,308 --> 00:31:42,544
No, just full of food.

214
00:31:42,608 --> 00:31:45,293
- Precisely.
- Mine.

215
00:31:46,923 --> 00:31:48,458
That's too bad.

216
00:31:48,521 --> 00:31:52,197
Those mountains are treacherous.
There are glaciers to be crossed.

217
00:31:52,326 --> 00:31:54,403
If you had roped up to me,
I could have kept you alive.

218
00:31:54,434 --> 00:31:56,769
Considering your performance
the last time we roped up...

219
00:31:56,769 --> 00:31:58,880
I think I'm safer without you.

220
00:32:02,972 --> 00:32:04,187
Of course.

221
00:32:08,373 --> 00:32:12,626
But I think you are wrong about
that Tibetan border calculatlon.

222
00:32:12,626 --> 00:32:15,662
By my measurements,
it is 65 kilometers.

223
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,619
Care to wager a kilo of food on that?

224
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:27,204
All you've got is some stale crackers.

225
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:31,198
But I'm right. I'll win.

226
00:33:11,064 --> 00:33:13,780
Tibet, the roof of the world.

227
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:16,848
It feels as though we have
ascended a medieval stone fortress...

228
00:33:16,977 --> 00:33:19,600
towering above the center of Asla.

229
00:33:19,727 --> 00:33:22,125
This ls the highest country on Earth.

230
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,009
And the most isolated.

231
00:33:32,674 --> 00:33:34,177
There it is.

232
00:33:35,104 --> 00:33:36,958
Tibet.

233
00:33:38,044 --> 00:33:41,592
- Exactly 68 kilometers.
- Congratulations.

234
00:33:42,904 --> 00:33:45,109
Unfortunately, you've eaten
all your winnings.

235
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,683
Yes.

236
00:34:03,747 --> 00:34:06,625
Just smile and say yes.
It's better that way.

237
00:34:10,046 --> 00:34:12,091
It's amazing what you learn
in prison, isn't it?

238
00:34:21,618 --> 00:34:23,119
Tibet.

239
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:28,203
- No foreigners allowed in Tlbet.
- Oh, please!

240
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:29,640
No foreigner!

241
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:31,718
Oh, please!

242
00:34:38,592 --> 00:34:41,661
Yes. Thank you. Of course.

243
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:09,955
No translation needed.

244
00:35:40,228 --> 00:35:42,433
Some people are glad to see us.

245
00:35:42,593 --> 00:35:44,638
Don't let it get to your head.

246
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:48,794
When the Tibetans clap hands, it means
they are driving out evil forces.

247
00:35:54,612 --> 00:35:56,467
We need to find food.

248
00:36:10,309 --> 00:36:13,794
It is the prophecy. It says here...

249
00:36:13,794 --> 00:36:17,854
in the final testament
of great thirteenth Dalai Lama.

250
00:36:17,982 --> 00:36:21,594
"It may happen that, in Tibet,
religions and government...

251
00:36:21,594 --> 00:36:24,311
will be attacked by outside forces.

252
00:36:24,409 --> 00:36:27,541
Unless we can guard our own country...

253
00:36:27,604 --> 00:36:30,610
monks and their monasteries
will be destroyed.

254
00:36:30,768 --> 00:36:34,285
The lands and property
of government officials will be seized.

255
00:36:34,413 --> 00:36:38,091
The Dalai Lama an d all
the revered holders of the faith...

256
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,519
will disappear and become nameless."

257
00:36:40,551 --> 00:36:44,194
Now you understand why we are not
welcome to forelgners here?

258
00:36:44,259 --> 00:36:48,192
Yes, but you must understand
we're not here to threaten or harm.

259
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,463
We just need food,
and then we'll be on our--

260
00:36:50,463 --> 00:36:52,475
His Excellency, the Garpon.

261
00:36:58,614 --> 00:37:02,066
Your Eminence, we're happy to see you.

262
00:37:02,226 --> 00:37:04,944
We wanted to apologize.

263
00:37:04,975 --> 00:37:06,541
Apologize.

264
00:37:09,417 --> 00:37:12,295
And give you this really special gift.

265
00:37:14,788 --> 00:37:16,802
Please, from us.

266
00:37:16,962 --> 00:37:20,065
Long live the Dalai Lama,
Hi s Holiness.

267
00:37:26,649 --> 00:37:29,526
Thank you for the picture.
Go back to lndla!

268
00:37:35,762 --> 00:37:39,917
Two days into Tibet 's western frontier
and we are graciously klcked out.

269
00:37:41,036 --> 00:37:43,114
Our guides have strict orders
to escort us...

270
00:37:43,273 --> 00:37:46,213
to the lndian border
some 40 kllometers away...

271
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:49,091
and to shoot us
if we attempt escape.

272
00:38:21,442 --> 00:38:23,455
Must mean hello.

273
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:25,726
As long as they don't try to kiss me.

274
00:38:29,754 --> 00:38:32,184
We have to stock up. I'm broke.

275
00:38:33,621 --> 00:38:35,413
Don't look at me.

276
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,769
We have to eat. Peter.

277
00:38:40,048 --> 00:38:42,287
It is not negotiable.

278
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:44,811
My father gave it to me
when I climbed Mount BI anc.

279
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:46,857
Everyone's climbed Mount Blanc.

280
00:38:46,952 --> 00:38:49,063
If I had a watch like this,
I would trade it.

281
00:39:30,973 --> 00:39:33,339
- Where did you get this jacket?
- North Tibet.

282
00:39:33,434 --> 00:39:35,769
Communlsm soldier come from Chin a.
Very nice.

283
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:38,741
They give food, money. Very nice.
Communism soldier.

284
00:39:41,298 --> 00:39:43,536
You like military uniforms, yes?

285
00:39:44,624 --> 00:39:48,331
I have German army boots.
For you. Yes?

286
00:39:48,395 --> 00:39:49,643
Wait.

287
00:39:57,988 --> 00:40:00,415
Give me these, for the guards.

288
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,984
Look!

289
00:40:07,865 --> 00:40:09,849
Like this. You like?

290
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:13,843
Very good. They're tough.

291
00:40:13,971 --> 00:40:17,519
My friend, shall I show you
how German soldiers march?

292
00:40:22,539 --> 00:40:24,650
You must make this face.

293
00:40:33,503 --> 00:40:35,838
Come! Yes.

294
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,435
Stop!

295
00:40:39,256 --> 00:40:42,263
Excellent. Yes.
You, with practice.

296
00:40:43,062 --> 00:40:46,610
Now, I will show you
how German soldiers run.

297
00:40:50,863 --> 00:40:52,717
Stand like this.

298
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:40,957
Guess what?

299
00:41:42,556 --> 00:41:44,313
All clear.

300
00:42:06,276 --> 00:42:08,768
Know what time it is?

301
00:42:11,166 --> 00:42:15,417
You think I'm so happy
to be traveling with you...

302
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:17,847
I should foot the bill?

303
00:42:17,943 --> 00:42:21,299
You are such a blg man
you don't need to contribute?

304
00:42:22,323 --> 00:42:23,761
You have a problem?

305
00:42:23,922 --> 00:42:25,327
Remind me...

306
00:42:26,416 --> 00:42:29,420
what you said at the bazaar back there.

307
00:42:29,452 --> 00:42:34,599
"If I had a watch like that,
I would trade it."

308
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,524
You do not have one.

309
00:42:39,588 --> 00:42:42,784
You cheap, lying bastard!
You have three!

310
00:42:54,325 --> 00:42:56,723
This is junk
from some ltalian prisoners.

311
00:42:56,723 --> 00:42:59,055
I don't give a shit!

312
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,196
Haven't you ever heard of a principle?

313
00:43:01,196 --> 00:43:03,594
What principle?

314
00:43:03,722 --> 00:43:06,599
You want a watch?
Go ahead. Pick one.

315
00:43:06,662 --> 00:43:08,996
- And keep your principles.
- Look at you !

316
00:43:10,595 --> 00:43:13,439
Caught being a selfish brat
and you're gloating !

317
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,381
You're acting like an old woman.
What do you want?

318
00:43:16,381 --> 00:43:19,673
Try apologizing.

319
00:43:19,673 --> 00:43:21,656
Try feeling a little remorse.

320
00:43:21,784 --> 00:43:25,140
And if all else fail s,
try wiping that smirk off your face!

321
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,569
Take your stinking watch
and shut up!

322
00:43:28,784 --> 00:43:32,716
I don't need another boring sermon from
some frustrated glorified tour guide.

323
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:44,417
No wonder you are always alone.

324
00:43:44,449 --> 00:43:47,518
No one can stand
your miserable company.

325
00:44:18,208 --> 00:44:20,478
Please, take them.

326
00:44:29,141 --> 00:44:31,410
It was wrong of me to hide them.

327
00:44:42,184 --> 00:44:44,420
- Keep this.
- No.

328
00:44:48,928 --> 00:44:53,181
I didn't deserve It either.
Go ahead.

329
00:45:09,327 --> 00:45:12,203
He'll be three and a half years old now.

330
00:45:16,391 --> 00:45:19,682
Pretty soon, she'll tell him
I was lost in the Himalayas.

331
00:45:22,943 --> 00:45:24,255
Which is fine.

332
00:45:26,109 --> 00:45:27,675
Why?

333
00:45:30,648 --> 00:45:33,654
Better a dead father
than a lousy father.

334
00:45:35,412 --> 00:45:37,297
Write him a letter.

335
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,718
Let him know you're still alive.

336
00:45:49,286 --> 00:45:51,395
New York.

337
00:45:55,838 --> 00:45:57,276
Venice.

338
00:46:02,776 --> 00:46:05,811
- Paris.
- Your Holiness, where are you?

339
00:46:05,973 --> 00:46:07,922
It ls time for your lesson.

340
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:17,769
Your Holiness, where are you?
It is time for your lesson.

341
00:46:20,871 --> 00:46:22,277
Dear Rolf Harrer:

342
00:46:23,332 --> 00:46:25,443
I'm a person you don 't know...

343
00:46:25,602 --> 00:46:28,319
a man you 've never met.

344
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,939
But you are someone
who occupies my mind...

345
00:46:31,035 --> 00:46:32,794
and my heart...

346
00:46:32,858 --> 00:46:34,904
in this dlstant land
where I have gone.

347
00:46:36,981 --> 00:46:40,819
If you can imagine a hidden place
tucked safely away from the world...

348
00:46:40,851 --> 00:46:44,078
concealed by walls
of high, snowcapped mountains--

349
00:46:44,206 --> 00:46:47,564
a place rich with all the strange
beauty of your nighttime dreams--

350
00:46:49,194 --> 00:46:50,983
then you know where I am.

351
00:46:53,925 --> 00:46:55,779
In the country
where I am traveling, Tibet...

352
00:46:56,643 --> 00:46:59,839
people believe if they walk
long distances to holy places...

353
00:46:59,998 --> 00:47:02,652
It purifles the bad deeds
they've committed.

354
00:47:02,716 --> 00:47:05,146
They believe
the more difficult the journey...

355
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:07,767
the greater the depth
of purification.

356
00:47:10,931 --> 00:47:14,608
I've been walking from one faraway
place to the next for many years--

357
00:47:15,759 --> 00:47:17,805
as long as you have lived.

358
00:47:18,956 --> 00:47:22,313
I have seen seasons change
across the high plateaus.

359
00:47:22,313 --> 00:47:25,542
I have seen wild kiangs
migrate south in winter...

360
00:47:25,638 --> 00:47:28,386
and sweep back across the fields
when spring appears.

361
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:32,670
In this place,
where time stands still...

362
00:47:32,798 --> 00:47:34,621
it seems that everything is moving...

363
00:47:35,517 --> 00:47:37,339
including me.

364
00:47:40,632 --> 00:47:42,453
I can 't say I know where I'm going...

365
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:45,425
nor whether my bad deeds
can be purified.

366
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,837
There are so many things
I have done which I regret.

367
00:47:51,021 --> 00:47:54,602
But when I come to a full stop,
I hope you will understand...

368
00:47:54,634 --> 00:47:58,117
that the distance between us
is not as great as it seems.

369
00:47:59,746 --> 00:48:01,443
Wlth deep affection...

370
00:48:01,507 --> 00:48:04,958
your father, Heinrlch Harrer.

371
00:48:05,789 --> 00:48:07,292
Get up.

372
00:48:16,946 --> 00:48:18,481
My God!

373
00:48:22,924 --> 00:48:24,746
I'll give you these.

374
00:48:44,375 --> 00:48:46,645
Yellow head!

375
00:48:46,773 --> 00:48:49,522
- No! Wait! We have nothing!
- Give me money!

376
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:50,961
We have no money!

377
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:52,880
Give me watch !

378
00:48:52,944 --> 00:48:55,436
- Give me clothes!
- We have nothing for you !

379
00:49:58,125 --> 00:49:59,948
Wait!

380
00:50:05,414 --> 00:50:07,301
Where are you headed?

381
00:50:11,682 --> 00:50:14,302
I have permit.

382
00:50:25,331 --> 00:50:27,122
Lhasa. I have permit.

383
00:51:11,653 --> 00:51:15,680
It is unseemly for the spiritual leader
of Tibet to spy on people.

384
00:51:20,412 --> 00:51:24,249
Only a month ago, we were certain
of death at the hands of bandits.

385
00:51:24,345 --> 00:51:29,842
And today, we have reached the gates
of the forbidden city of Lhasa.

386
00:51:29,969 --> 00:51:32,623
It is as difficult a goal as Mecca...

387
00:51:32,688 --> 00:51:37,292
and preclsely as attractive
because it ls closed to all foreigners.

388
00:51:38,636 --> 00:51:40,968
Even in our miserable condition...

389
00:51:40,968 --> 00:51:43,845
we feel the lure
of Tlbet 's holiest city...

390
00:51:43,972 --> 00:51:46,212
home of the Dalai Lama.

391
00:51:47,074 --> 00:51:49,822
Only a few foreigners
had penetrated its mysteries.

392
00:52:52,256 --> 00:52:55,294
Oh, my God!

393
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:09,423
- Is It over?
- No. it is not over.

394
00:53:49,128 --> 00:53:52,005
You are invited to stay
for lunch, if you like.

395
00:53:53,126 --> 00:53:54,629
We'd like that very much.

396
00:53:56,322 --> 00:53:58,943
I am Tsarong. Welcome to my home.

397
00:53:58,974 --> 00:54:01,308
I am Peter.

398
00:54:05,526 --> 00:54:07,671
Lord Chamberlain, may I request...

399
00:54:07,734 --> 00:54:11,186
an audlence with the regent
and ministers of the cabinet?

400
00:54:11,282 --> 00:54:15,536
It's about two foreigners
who came to Lhasa.

401
00:54:20,328 --> 00:54:22,278
With respect, Rinpoche...

402
00:54:23,207 --> 00:54:26,115
If your intention is to stop the Chinese
from recruiting political allies...

403
00:54:26,243 --> 00:54:31,390
then demanding that they stop
trying to bribe monks...

404
00:54:31,422 --> 00:54:33,788
is not the most effective tactic.

405
00:54:35,994 --> 00:54:40,052
I asked the opinion of the ministers,
not that of a mere secretary.

406
00:54:43,282 --> 00:54:46,638
Of course. Forgive me.

407
00:54:46,638 --> 00:54:48,460
You may leave now.

408
00:54:48,557 --> 00:54:51,945
Start translating the letter
as written .

409
00:54:51,945 --> 00:54:54,471
Of course.

410
00:55:11,032 --> 00:55:14,227
Do you realize how many men
could survive such an ordeal?

411
00:55:15,122 --> 00:55:17,009
We should respect them.

412
00:55:17,104 --> 00:55:21,005
If we return them to lndla,
they'll surely go back to prison.

413
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:24,202
But they have no purpose here,
Kungo Tsarong. No place to live.

414
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:27,974
I have invited them to stay
at my guest quarters...

415
00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:32,193
assuming you would grant them permission
to remain in Lhasa, of course.

416
00:55:32,322 --> 00:55:35,038
Invited them to stay at your place?

417
00:55:35,613 --> 00:55:36,988
But why?

418
00:55:37,116 --> 00:55:39,930
Must one have reason
to help those in need?

419
00:55:42,934 --> 00:55:44,469
Beast.

420
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:50,959
I think she said you stink.

421
00:56:24,622 --> 00:56:27,339
You do not need
to introduce yourselves.

422
00:56:27,403 --> 00:56:29,289
I know who you are.

423
00:56:30,087 --> 00:56:32,326
I am Pema Lhaki.

424
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:36,001
Ngawang wishes to make a gift to you,
so please take your clothes off.

425
00:56:40,031 --> 00:56:42,109
Let's get started.
I don't have all day.

426
00:56:42,173 --> 00:56:47,256
Well, this is most kind
of Ngawang Jigme.

427
00:56:47,287 --> 00:56:49,747
Who is he to be so thoughtful?

428
00:56:49,811 --> 00:56:52,082
Secretary to the ministers
of the government.

429
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:54,736
He wished to make you
a gift of new clothes.

430
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:57,740
Please select your preferred
article of clothing.

431
00:57:00,299 --> 00:57:01,864
You're a seamstress?

432
00:57:01,864 --> 00:57:05,764
I am a tailor, sir,
the only tailor in Lhasa...

433
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:09,600
who has been to Calcutta and
can reproduce these silly costumes.

434
00:57:12,062 --> 00:57:14,939
So, I pick?

435
00:57:15,066 --> 00:57:17,368
Yes, choose whichever you like.

436
00:57:21,045 --> 00:57:23,125
- And you can make any of these?
- Yes.

437
00:57:24,019 --> 00:57:26,800
- Very good.
- Did you make this?

438
00:57:26,864 --> 00:57:29,996
- Yes.
- Beautiful.

439
00:57:29,996 --> 00:57:31,659
- Th ank you.
- Do you like this?

440
00:57:31,787 --> 00:57:33,609
Whichever you like.

441
00:57:36,614 --> 00:57:39,108
I will have this handsome tweed jacket.

442
00:57:39,204 --> 00:57:42,720
And this pair of sporting
woolen trousers, please.

443
00:57:42,752 --> 00:57:45,117
- Good choice.
- Thanks.

444
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:47,035
And you, sir?

445
00:57:50,455 --> 00:57:53,015
- Perhaps you could choose for me.
- Thank you.

446
00:57:57,010 --> 00:58:00,336
Please, sir, take off your chu-pa.
I would like to measure.

447
00:58:12,642 --> 00:58:14,336
Stand still, please.

448
00:58:18,429 --> 00:58:20,218
Thls way, please.

449
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:26,452
- Stand still.
- Sorry.

450
00:58:35,018 --> 00:58:37,643
- No moving, please.
- I'm sorry.

451
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,055
That way, you will never fall.
It's perfect.

452
00:58:49,118 --> 00:58:52,636
Still, walking up mountain s
is a fool's pleasure, Heinrich.

453
00:58:52,731 --> 00:58:54,937
Not so foolish, really.

454
00:58:59,444 --> 00:59:00,786
Look at this.

455
00:59:03,152 --> 00:59:04,621
Go ahead.

456
00:59:09,195 --> 00:59:12,295
That's after I climbed
the Eiger North Face.

457
00:59:16,642 --> 00:59:21,789
That's Olympics.
Gold medal. Not important.

458
00:59:21,853 --> 00:59:26,616
Then this is another great difference
between our civilization and yours.

459
00:59:26,649 --> 00:59:28,375
You admire the man...

460
00:59:28,375 --> 00:59:32,403
who pushes his way to the top
in any walk of life...

461
00:59:32,466 --> 00:59:35,759
while we admire the man
who abandons his ego.

462
00:59:38,413 --> 00:59:41,610
The average Tibetan wouldn't think
to thrust himself forward this way.

463
00:59:57,785 --> 00:59:59,736
Gentlemen.

464
01:00:02,964 --> 01:00:05,330
- I'm sorry. Have we met?
- No, we have not.

465
01:00:05,361 --> 01:00:07,953
I am Ngawang Jigme.

466
01:00:11,948 --> 01:00:14,728
- Yes, of course.
- Forgive us.

467
01:00:14,792 --> 01:00:17,445
Thank you for your generous gift.

468
01:00:17,605 --> 01:00:19,619
It's wonderful. Thank you.

469
01:00:21,762 --> 01:00:26,111
You are most welcome.
I am sure we will meet again.

470
01:00:36,978 --> 01:00:40,688
Perhaps you could help us explain...

471
01:00:40,751 --> 01:00:42,763
why the min isters...

472
01:00:42,763 --> 01:00:46,474
demand that the Chinese government...

473
01:00:46,538 --> 01:00:50,276
"...cease making generous
financlal contributions...

474
01:00:50,437 --> 01:00:54,338
to Tibetan monasteries."

475
01:00:54,402 --> 01:00:58,556
Do our gifts displease your government?

476
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:02,648
I cannot speak for the regent
nor the ministers, Excellence.

477
01:01:02,746 --> 01:01:04,950
I am only a mere secretary.

478
01:01:05,014 --> 01:01:09,331
Not for long, I presume.
Sit down.

479
01:01:16,811 --> 01:01:20,071
A man of such obvious talent
cannot be satisfied...

480
01:01:20,104 --> 01:01:24,324
with just translating letters.

481
01:01:24,388 --> 01:01:27,297
Your diplomatic skill...

482
01:01:27,456 --> 01:01:30,111
would be richly rewarded here.

483
01:01:33,178 --> 01:01:36,792
Serving my country faithfully
is reward enough, Excellence.

484
01:01:39,925 --> 01:01:41,778
I ask permission to take my leave.

485
01:02:49,549 --> 01:02:52,077
It looks like we're both in need
of a good tailor today.

486
01:02:52,971 --> 01:02:54,474
Yes, there's a--

487
01:02:55,434 --> 01:02:57,671
Please, take a seat.

488
01:03:39,613 --> 01:03:41,979
Do you like these?
I'll buy them for you.

489
01:03:42,105 --> 01:03:45,144
Thank you,
but I don't eat much meat.

490
01:03:45,209 --> 01:03:48,213
- Don't eat meat?
- He says they are knives from West.

491
01:03:48,308 --> 01:03:50,545
You put them on your feet to cut meat.

492
01:03:54,415 --> 01:03:56,335
They are ice skates.

493
01:03:56,397 --> 01:03:58,889
You put them on your feet...

494
01:03:58,889 --> 01:04:00,105
to skate...

495
01:04:00,201 --> 01:04:02,758
to glide--
sort of dance on ice.

496
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:04,642
- Yeah.
- Why?

497
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:08,256
- Why n ot?
- It's another fool's pleasure.

498
01:04:12,795 --> 01:04:15,098
Let's get them.
How mu--

499
01:04:19,924 --> 01:04:22,420
No, for this?

500
01:04:22,452 --> 01:04:23,985
Ten.

501
01:04:26,669 --> 01:04:28,012
And for this?

502
01:04:28,076 --> 01:04:29,996
Did you see?

503
01:04:30,762 --> 01:04:32,648
Did you see that?

504
01:04:43,388 --> 01:04:46,937
- Did you hurt yourself?
- No, thank you. I'm okay.

505
01:04:46,969 --> 01:04:50,453
Here we go. Up.

506
01:04:50,485 --> 01:04:54,323
- You okay? Did you bang your head?
- No, I'm having fun.

507
01:04:54,482 --> 01:04:56,752
- You must hold on.
- Watch me!

508
01:05:09,636 --> 01:05:12,033
- Do not look too much at the ground.
- All right.

509
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:13,982
- Look only lnto my eyes.
- Yes, all right.

510
01:05:30,638 --> 01:05:33,994
Can I help you?
Here, take my h and.

511
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:45,216
- Are you happy?
- Very happy.

512
01:06:07,945 --> 01:06:10,663
I try to picture you, Rolf...

513
01:06:10,759 --> 01:06:13,348
and this is what I see:

514
01:06:13,444 --> 01:06:16,545
a young boy who is strong
and bright...

515
01:06:17,855 --> 01:06:20,731
a boy filled with curioslty
about llfe...

516
01:06:22,651 --> 01:06:26,615
a boy who lsn't afraid
to learn from his mistakes.

517
01:06:48,416 --> 01:06:49,950
Hello, married woman.

518
01:06:51,421 --> 01:06:53,628
Hello. bachelor man.

519
01:06:58,967 --> 01:07:00,724
Congratulations.

520
01:07:02,770 --> 01:07:06,030
Well. come in.

521
01:07:06,094 --> 01:07:09,132
The Japanese army is facing
a growing challenge...

522
01:07:09,196 --> 01:07:11,529
not from China 's unified front...

523
01:07:11,593 --> 01:07:13,735
but from the powerful
Chinese Communist Army.

524
01:07:13,799 --> 01:07:16,069
Under the control
of Mao Tse-tung--

525
01:07:19,105 --> 01:07:22,623
The rumor is that
the Communists have taken over...

526
01:07:22,655 --> 01:07:25,373
the whole of North and Central China.

527
01:07:25,373 --> 01:07:27,194
Rumor? It's a fact.

528
01:07:27,259 --> 01:07:30,071
Ngawang keeps me up-to-date
on all China's war news.

529
01:07:42,731 --> 01:07:46,121
So, how are things at Kungo Tsarong's?

530
01:07:46,248 --> 01:07:49,507
Frankly, I wouldn't know.
I moved out five months ago.

531
01:07:49,603 --> 01:07:52,865
Really? Has it been this long
since we have seen you?

532
01:07:52,993 --> 01:07:56,862
- Apparently it h as.
- And have you been busy?

533
01:07:56,989 --> 01:07:59,772
This is why I'm extremely busy...

534
01:07:59,932 --> 01:08:02,807
since I've been hired to survey
the entire clty of Lhasa.

535
01:08:04,085 --> 01:08:08,946
Unfortunately, your place is too
far out for me to include it on my map.

536
01:08:10,193 --> 01:08:12,556
We like our privacy.

537
01:08:14,956 --> 01:08:16,618
Yes, apparently so.

538
01:08:18,791 --> 01:08:21,540
What about women?
Have you met anyone you like?

539
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:24,417
Women.

540
01:08:24,481 --> 01:08:27,614
Since I failed miserably
with an Austrlan wife...

541
01:08:27,678 --> 01:08:30,140
an exotic failure with
a Tibetan wife seems misguided.

542
01:08:30,235 --> 01:08:34,007
But to answer your question,
no, I haven't. You?

543
01:08:36,213 --> 01:08:40,019
A friend's good fortune
is a blessing.

544
01:08:40,082 --> 01:08:41,872
I'm sorry you resent ours.

545
01:08:45,997 --> 01:08:48,107
You must be very lonely and sad.

546
01:09:09,621 --> 01:09:11,538
The war is over!

547
01:09:11,602 --> 01:09:13,202
Have the Communists won?

548
01:09:13,329 --> 01:09:16,207
Your war, my friend.
Germany has surrendered.

549
01:09:23,079 --> 01:09:27,299
- Where are you going?
- Back home. Austria.

550
01:09:46,768 --> 01:09:48,973
Mr. Harrer, letter.

551
01:09:54,409 --> 01:09:56,422
We miss you .

552
01:09:58,788 --> 01:10:00,099
I miss you.

553
01:10:16,626 --> 01:10:18,991
"Dear Mr. Helnrich Harrer:

554
01:10:18,991 --> 01:10:21,326
You are not my father.

555
01:10:21,422 --> 01:10:24,779
Please stop writing me letters.

556
01:10:24,843 --> 01:10:26,760
Rolf lmmendorf."

557
01:10:54,540 --> 01:10:56,425
Honorable Harry Harrer?

558
01:11:01,446 --> 01:11:03,618
- Yes?
- A letter for you.

559
01:11:04,673 --> 01:11:07,871
The Honorable Heinrich Harrer
doesn't want any more letters.

560
01:11:08,032 --> 01:11:11,739
It is from the Great Mother
of His Holiness, the Dalai Lama.

561
01:11:40,544 --> 01:11:42,462
Thank you for comlng, Mr. Harrer.

562
01:11:42,557 --> 01:11:45,466
Thank you for inviting me,
Great Mother.

563
01:11:54,641 --> 01:11:58,284
Do you know the rules
of protocol concerning my son?

564
01:12:00,107 --> 01:12:04,998
Not exact-- I know one bows
and performs prostrations.

565
01:12:06,564 --> 01:12:08,866
When you are in the presence
of His Holiness...

566
01:12:08,962 --> 01:12:11,104
you must always be standing...

567
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:14,971
bent in obeisance,
hands folded in supplication.

568
01:12:15,068 --> 01:12:18,871
If seated, you must always
be seated lower than he.

569
01:12:18,968 --> 01:12:22,772
Never look him in the eye.
Never speak before he does.

570
01:12:22,869 --> 01:12:25,779
Always refer to him
as "Your Holiness."

571
01:12:25,874 --> 01:12:29,742
Never turn your back to him.
And never. never touch him.

572
01:12:29,774 --> 01:12:33,099
He is the reincarnation
of Avalokiteshvara...

573
01:12:33,130 --> 01:12:35,048
the Bodhisattva of Compassion.

574
01:12:36,584 --> 01:12:39,429
After his recognition,
he was renamed...

575
01:12:39,429 --> 01:12:44,385
Jetsun Jamphel Ngawang Lobsang
Yeshi Tenzin Gyatso...

576
01:12:44,416 --> 01:12:49,017
Holy Lord, Gentle Glory,
Eloquent, Compassionate...

577
01:12:49,113 --> 01:12:53,687
Learned Defender of the Faith ,
Ocean of Wisdom.

578
01:12:54,805 --> 01:12:58,642
His Holiness, the Dalai Lama,
would like to meet you.

579
01:13:01,614 --> 01:13:06,089
As his advisors have not permitted
a private audlence with you...

580
01:13:06,122 --> 01:13:11,396
His Holiness has asked me to bring you
along to my monthly audience.

581
01:13:19,771 --> 01:13:22,136
I'd be honored and moved.

582
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:19,556
Yellow head.

583
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:31,354
You have hair on your arms too?
And legs?

584
01:15:41,294 --> 01:15:43,310
- How about you?
- Mr. Harrer.

585
01:15:48,008 --> 01:15:50,245
It's an honor to meet you,
Your Holiness.

586
01:16:02,458 --> 01:16:03,927
Do you like movies?

587
01:16:06,646 --> 01:16:08,628
You know, I haven't seen a movie
in about eight years.

588
01:16:08,757 --> 01:16:12,113
- But as I recall, yes, very much.
- So do l.

589
01:16:12,271 --> 01:16:16,941
- I'm glad to hear that.
- I have a movie projector. And films.

590
01:16:17,068 --> 01:16:20,969
I want to build a movie house.
Here. at the Potala.

591
01:16:21,129 --> 01:16:24,357
- With seats and everything.
- Seats would be advisable.

592
01:16:24,422 --> 01:16:26,116
Can you build it?

593
01:16:28,641 --> 01:16:31,038
- Excuse me?
- Can you build a movie house for me?

594
01:16:31,102 --> 01:16:34,777
My advisors cannot disapprove,
and you wIll be well paid.

595
01:16:34,809 --> 01:16:37,848
And you will have to come here every day
to build it, every single day.

596
01:16:37,974 --> 01:16:41,971
When you are here, you'll visit me. We
can have conversations on many toplcs.

597
01:16:42,003 --> 01:16:44,625
I would like to learn
about the world you come from.

598
01:16:44,753 --> 01:16:48,300
For example, where is Paris, France?
And what's a Molotov cocktall?

599
01:16:48,426 --> 01:16:50,090
And who i s Jack the Ripper?

600
01:16:51,369 --> 01:16:53,287
You can tell me many things.

601
01:16:58,628 --> 01:17:01,343
I'm proud to be of servlce,
Your Holiness.

602
01:17:23,274 --> 01:17:25,128
What is the problem?

603
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:28,677
Worms.

604
01:17:28,741 --> 01:17:31,106
Please, no more hurtlng worms.

605
01:17:31,106 --> 01:17:33,183
- Please.
- Worms?

606
01:17:33,344 --> 01:17:38,108
In a past life, thls innocent worm
could have been your mother.

607
01:17:38,236 --> 01:17:40,090
Please, no more h urting.

608
01:17:40,154 --> 01:17:42,934
It's impossible. Please, no more.

609
01:17:44,789 --> 01:17:47,155
But you see, Tibetans believe...

610
01:17:47,155 --> 01:17:50,543
all living creatures were
their mothers in a past life.

611
01:17:50,607 --> 01:17:54,794
So we must show them respect
and repay their kindness.

612
01:17:54,956 --> 01:17:58,664
And never, never
harm anything that lives.

613
01:17:58,664 --> 01:18:01,987
You can't ask a devout people
to disregard a precious teaching.

614
01:18:02,115 --> 01:18:03,777
Yes, but Your Holin ess...

615
01:18:06,303 --> 01:18:09,851
with true respect,
we can't possibly--

616
01:18:12,088 --> 01:18:14,742
I'm sorry, but we can't
possibly rescue all the worms...

617
01:18:14,807 --> 01:18:17,556
not if you want a theater
finished in this lifetime.

618
01:18:17,619 --> 01:18:20,784
You have a clever mind.
Think of a solution.

619
01:18:20,848 --> 01:18:23,981
And in the meantime, you can
explaln to me what is an elevator.

620
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:59,146
Antarctica.
That's down below.

621
01:19:01,543 --> 01:19:02,439
Here.

622
01:19:04,741 --> 01:19:06,754
Fantastic.

623
01:19:12,157 --> 01:19:13,532
Englan d.

624
01:19:16,249 --> 01:19:18,902
Don't look at me for h elp.

625
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:22,131
Here?

626
01:19:29,677 --> 01:19:31,082
Shift.

627
01:19:33,191 --> 01:19:36,005
Oh, I know him.
Honk. Hello!

628
01:19:37,859 --> 01:19:38,883
Turn !

629
01:19:40,736 --> 01:19:42,622
Brake!

630
01:20:12,545 --> 01:20:17,213
The robe of a minister is so much finer
than your old brown robe, i sn't it?

631
01:20:18,426 --> 01:20:19,930
Please.

632
01:20:19,930 --> 01:20:22,136
Everyone, please.

633
01:20:22,232 --> 01:20:24,439
You must be very clever
to get such a good promotion.

634
01:20:25,556 --> 01:20:27,859
I did not intend to be
a secretary forever.

635
01:20:28,019 --> 01:20:30,288
Apparently so.

636
01:20:30,416 --> 01:20:32,972
Well , congratulations.

637
01:20:46,176 --> 01:20:47,742
Evil omen !

638
01:20:53,784 --> 01:20:56,885
From his headquarters
in Peking...

639
01:20:56,950 --> 01:20:59,985
the Chairman, Mao Tse-tung,
was triumphantly proclaimed leader...

640
01:21:00,050 --> 01:21:01,968
of the new
People 's Republic of China.

641
01:21:04,780 --> 01:21:08,651
Chairman Mao vowed that the first task
of the Communist regime...

642
01:21:08,714 --> 01:21:11,719
is to reunite
the Chinese motherland.

643
01:21:11,847 --> 01:21:14,755
He declared that
the remote kingdom of Tibet...

644
01:21:14,789 --> 01:21:17,664
Is an lntegral part
of the Chinese territory...

645
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:19,742
and must join
the great new republic.

646
01:21:19,775 --> 01:21:22,140
"...and must join
the great n ew republic."

647
01:21:22,173 --> 01:21:25,689
People's Republic of China
is advised...

648
01:21:25,753 --> 01:21:30,771
the government of Tibet
recognizes no foreign sovereign.

649
01:21:30,804 --> 01:21:33,105
We are an independent nation.

650
01:21:33,201 --> 01:21:36,813
All the Chinese officials will be
expelled from the borders of Tibet.

651
01:21:37,772 --> 01:21:39,533
We wish you a happy return
to your h omeland.

652
01:21:39,628 --> 01:21:43,304
Have a safe and pleasant journey
back to China.

653
01:21:43,369 --> 01:21:47,234
May you have a safe and
pleasant journey back to China.

654
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:52,413
We wish you a happy return
to your homeland.

655
01:21:52,477 --> 01:21:54,780
May you have happiness
and prosperity.

656
01:21:57,336 --> 01:21:58,648
Let me see.

657
01:22:00,119 --> 01:22:05,744
You have a very long lifeline,
unlike others here.

658
01:23:02,105 --> 01:23:05,142
When we are faclng the light,
it's day, yes?

659
01:23:05,238 --> 01:23:07,666
When we are in shadow,
it's night.

660
01:23:07,764 --> 01:23:11,535
So if the sun is just rising
in Lhasa...

661
01:23:12,462 --> 01:23:15,115
that means it is just setting...

662
01:23:15,212 --> 01:23:18,505
in New York City, perhaps.

663
01:23:18,505 --> 01:23:21,861
That's why it can't be the same time
in every place.

664
01:23:21,956 --> 01:23:25,665
- Does that answer your question?
- Yes!

665
01:23:53,478 --> 01:23:55,364
Tell me more.

666
01:23:57,635 --> 01:23:59,743
What else do you want to know?

667
01:24:01,053 --> 01:24:05,018
In a few moments, you wIll be
entering the world of mass media.

668
01:24:05,018 --> 01:24:07,448
I can hear news
from all over the planet?

669
01:24:07,479 --> 01:24:10,197
I don't know if they have live
broadcasts from the Tonga lslands...

670
01:24:10,293 --> 01:24:13,777
but generally speaking, yeah.

671
01:24:13,874 --> 01:24:16,655
Do you listen to news
from your country?

672
01:24:16,655 --> 01:24:20,491
From Austri a?
No, not really.

673
01:24:20,522 --> 01:24:22,440
Give me some light, Ku-Dun.

674
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:26,117
- Why? It's your home.
- Not anymore It isn't.

675
01:24:26,117 --> 01:24:28,643
But don't you have
friends and family there?

676
01:24:28,674 --> 01:24:31,105
A few friends, no family.

677
01:24:32,830 --> 01:24:35,036
Keep the light steady,
Your Holiness.

678
01:24:37,145 --> 01:24:39,289
Why? ls everyone dead?

679
01:24:41,685 --> 01:24:44,946
Do you know there's another sentence
construction aside from the question?

680
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:49,998
I was married,
but I'm divorced.

681
01:24:51,787 --> 01:24:53,354
What did you do?

682
01:25:01,986 --> 01:25:05,664
I didn't want a child,
so I ran away to climb a mountain.

683
01:25:05,759 --> 01:25:07,996
You h ave a child?

684
01:25:09,978 --> 01:25:13,112
Although I've never seen hlm.

685
01:25:14,229 --> 01:25:18,001
All right. Let me show you
how this thing works.

686
01:25:34,113 --> 01:25:36,895
- Glve it all you've got.
- Yes, Mr. Harrer.

687
01:26:16,663 --> 01:26:18,005
Happy Christmas.

688
01:26:18,997 --> 01:26:20,437
Thank you.

689
01:26:31,881 --> 01:26:34,436
- What is this special occasion?
- This is Chrlstmas.

690
01:26:35,301 --> 01:26:38,433
And this is for you, my friend.
Go on.

691
01:27:25,075 --> 01:27:26,961
"I found it in a shop
in the Barkhor.

692
01:27:27,793 --> 01:27:31,214
It has traveled a long way
and finally come back home.

693
01:27:31,373 --> 01:27:34,634
Thank you for your friendshlp.
Heinrich. "

694
01:27:57,684 --> 01:27:59,538
It is incredible.

695
01:28:02,414 --> 01:28:04,332
Thank you for saving my life.

696
01:28:14,179 --> 01:28:16,800
...must be liberated
from religlous oppressors.

697
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:18,782
Tibetans must be reunited...

698
01:28:18,782 --> 01:28:20,540
- with their brothers and sisters...
- Turn that off.

699
01:28:20,636 --> 01:28:23,800
- of the great family of new China.
- I'm very sorry.

700
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:26,742
Foreigners control
Tibet's corrupt government.

701
01:28:26,742 --> 01:28:31,025
Our Tibetan comrades must be liberated
from foreign imperialists.

702
01:28:31,089 --> 01:28:33,998
Tibet 's million serfs
must be freed.

703
01:28:34,093 --> 01:28:37,067
How many foreigners
are there in Tibet?

704
01:28:37,131 --> 01:28:39,561
You, Heinrich.

705
01:28:39,625 --> 01:28:41,160
Tibet will be liberated.

706
01:29:41,963 --> 01:29:44,839
He asked for you, Mr. Harrer.

707
01:29:58,332 --> 01:30:03,413
They were destroying the village
I was born in, Takster in Amdo.

708
01:30:03,413 --> 01:30:05,651
It was terrible.

709
01:30:05,747 --> 01:30:09,137
It was just a dream.
You had a bad dream. That's all.

710
01:30:09,202 --> 01:30:12,973
But it was so real.
Where did it come from?

711
01:30:14,315 --> 01:30:18,151
My mind could never imagine
such terrible things.

712
01:30:59,231 --> 01:31:03,960
I can't sleep.
I'm afraid the dream will come back.

713
01:31:06,550 --> 01:31:09,013
A couple of insomniacs.

714
01:31:11,891 --> 01:31:13,456
Tell me a story.

715
01:31:16,111 --> 01:31:18,315
Tell me a story
about cllmbing mountains.

716
01:31:18,443 --> 01:31:23,431
That's one way to fall asleep.
Those stories bore even me.

717
01:31:23,431 --> 01:31:25,669
Then tell me
what you love about it.

718
01:31:25,669 --> 01:31:27,107
What--

719
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:33,947
The absolute simplicity.
That's what I love.

720
01:31:35,131 --> 01:31:38,552
When you're climbing,
your mind is clear...

721
01:31:38,615 --> 01:31:40,789
freed of all confusions.

722
01:31:40,854 --> 01:31:42,613
You have focus.

723
01:31:44,114 --> 01:31:47,596
And suddenly
the light becomes sharper...

724
01:31:47,693 --> 01:31:50,123
sounds are rlcher...

725
01:31:50,251 --> 01:31:52,808
and you are filled with...

726
01:31:52,808 --> 01:31:56,230
the deep, powerful presence of life.

727
01:32:01,312 --> 01:32:04,796
I've only felt that way
one other time.

728
01:32:04,892 --> 01:32:06,682
When?

729
01:32:11,191 --> 01:32:13,109
In your presence, Ku-Dun.

730
01:32:15,474 --> 01:32:19,215
The Chinese have already secured
much of the northern border regions.

731
01:32:19,374 --> 01:32:22,571
They have ransacked a village,
destroyed the monasteries...

732
01:32:22,603 --> 01:32:25,320
burnt scriptures
and defaced holy relics.

733
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:27,272
We've been told they've
even killed some monks--

734
01:32:27,367 --> 01:32:30,436
- Which vill age?
- Takster in Amdo.

735
01:32:30,563 --> 01:32:33,440
It's where His Holiness was born.

736
01:32:43,991 --> 01:32:45,397
Go ahead.

737
01:32:47,698 --> 01:32:50,480
When you were defense minister
to the previous Dalai Lama...

738
01:32:50,576 --> 01:32:52,973
then you wanted to
reorganlze the army.

739
01:32:53,004 --> 01:32:54,892
Can you do it now?

740
01:32:54,955 --> 01:32:59,239
The People's Liberation Army
is one million troops strong.

741
01:32:59,368 --> 01:33:02,754
We have 8,000 men
with 50 pieces of artillery...

742
01:33:02,786 --> 01:33:05,154
and a few hundred mortars
and machine guns.

743
01:33:05,217 --> 01:33:06,783
The task is hopeless.

744
01:33:06,879 --> 01:33:09,308
Then you refuse
the appointment, do you?

745
01:33:11,995 --> 01:33:14,231
No. I accept it with honor.

746
01:33:15,415 --> 01:33:18,004
You two gentlemen know about wars.

747
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:20,400
What type of weapon
do you recommend?

748
01:33:33,860 --> 01:33:36,353
It seems the Chinese troops are
advancing toward our northern borders.

749
01:33:36,419 --> 01:33:38,783
Where's His Holiness?

750
01:33:38,783 --> 01:33:40,765
The glory of
a British coronation.

751
01:33:40,862 --> 01:33:43,803
Nowhere in the world
is there anything half so wonderful.

752
01:33:43,803 --> 01:33:46,967
Only once or twice in the life of each
one of us comes such a day as this...

753
01:33:47,031 --> 01:33:49,621
when we know that we are watchlng
history in the making...

754
01:33:49,621 --> 01:33:53,330
when we know that generations to come
will look back on this day...

755
01:33:53,457 --> 01:33:56,399
for May 12, 1937, wIll be
one of the dates in hlstory...

756
01:33:56,430 --> 01:33:59,947
that schoolchildren will learn about
maybe a thousand years from now.

757
01:34:00,042 --> 01:34:01,512
Every moment
the thrill of excitement--

758
01:34:01,641 --> 01:34:05,987
Do you thlnk someday people will
look at Tibet on the movie screen...

759
01:34:05,987 --> 01:34:07,938
and wonder what happened to us?

760
01:34:08,003 --> 01:34:09,698
The coronation coach moves forward.

761
01:34:09,761 --> 01:34:12,096
I don't know.

762
01:34:12,192 --> 01:34:14,109
Don't you have all the answers?

763
01:34:18,136 --> 01:34:19,990
I don't.

764
01:34:27,088 --> 01:34:30,604
On the same field where Tibetans
traditionally gathered for picnics...

765
01:34:30,604 --> 01:34:32,523
ground was cleared
to build an alrstrip...

766
01:34:32,649 --> 01:34:36,037
so that the plane carrying
three Chinese generals could land.

767
01:34:36,037 --> 01:34:39,458
Nearby, the Tibetan army
practiced its maneuvers.

768
01:34:39,554 --> 01:34:42,177
Some of the soldiers
wear ancient mesh armour.

769
01:34:42,177 --> 01:34:45,565
They bring old muskets
and spears as artillery.

770
01:34:45,661 --> 01:34:50,967
The spectacle of a peace-lovlng nation,
vainly attempting to create a mllitary.

771
01:34:50,999 --> 01:34:54,067
The fears of war
on my friends ' faces...

772
01:34:54,099 --> 01:34:58,577
strike a deeply burled
personal chord.

773
01:34:58,641 --> 01:35:01,231
Echoes of the aggressions
of my own country...

774
01:35:01,326 --> 01:35:04,172
the will to overpower
weaker peoples...

775
01:35:04,203 --> 01:35:07,241
bring shame to me.

776
01:35:07,272 --> 01:35:11,557
I shudder to recall how once long ago
I embraced the same beliefs...

777
01:35:11,620 --> 01:35:13,633
how at one time I was, in fact...

778
01:35:13,666 --> 01:35:17,693
no different from
these intolerant Chinese.

779
01:35:19,421 --> 01:35:21,784
The Tibetans say an enemy
is the greatest teacher...

780
01:35:21,817 --> 01:35:24,887
because only an enemy can help
develop patience and compassion.

781
01:35:25,974 --> 01:35:28,690
They believe with rock-llke faith
that the power of their religion...

782
01:35:28,755 --> 01:35:31,215
will protect them
against these Chinese.

783
01:35:32,750 --> 01:35:34,796
In preparation for
the generals ' visit...

784
01:35:34,957 --> 01:35:37,961
sacred ceremonies are performed
throughout Lhasa.

785
01:35:37,992 --> 01:35:42,948
Sculptures of deities have been carved
with great care in butter.

786
01:35:43,044 --> 01:35:47,550
As the sun melts them, they become
a reminder that nothlng lasts.

787
01:36:00,402 --> 01:36:03,951
The rising star of the cabinet,
Minister Ngawang Jigme...

788
01:36:04,016 --> 01:36:06,476
made an offering of his own
to greet the Chinese generals...

789
01:36:06,572 --> 01:36:08,491
and lead them through Lhasa.

790
01:36:11,561 --> 01:36:14,341
Raising their flag is an honor
the Chinese don't deserve.

791
01:36:14,437 --> 01:36:17,761
When you are not strong enough to fight,
you should embrace your enemy.

792
01:36:17,857 --> 01:36:20,958
With both arms around you,
he cannot point a gun at you.

793
01:36:20,991 --> 01:36:24,314
Nothing in politics
is a matter of honor, my friend.

794
01:37:26,974 --> 01:37:31,481
History repeats itself,
even in paradise.

795
01:37:32,950 --> 01:37:36,243
General, we shall have
our audience with His--

796
01:38:00,571 --> 01:38:04,760
General, the monks have been making
this mandala of sand for many days.

797
01:38:05,813 --> 01:38:08,499
It is a symbol of
enlightenment and peace.

798
01:38:08,564 --> 01:38:09,874
General !

799
01:38:21,638 --> 01:38:25,154
We do not sit lower than he does.

800
01:38:25,218 --> 01:38:27,360
But, General,
It is our custom.

801
01:38:27,777 --> 01:38:29,661
I can sit down there.

802
01:38:45,966 --> 01:38:48,556
Your Holiness,
this is General Chang Jing Wu...

803
01:38:48,652 --> 01:38:51,784
General Than Gua,
General Than Gua San.

804
01:38:51,945 --> 01:38:54,630
They wish to have
an audience with you.

805
01:38:55,941 --> 01:38:59,137
May you have happiness
and prosperity.

806
01:39:00,638 --> 01:39:05,115
They are promising regional autonomy
and religious freedom...

807
01:39:05,146 --> 01:39:09,975
if Tibet accepts that China
be its political master.

808
01:39:12,182 --> 01:39:17,517
Until I attain my majority, the
regent ls the political leader of Tibet.

809
01:39:17,517 --> 01:39:19,948
You should have requested
an audlence with him...

810
01:39:20,043 --> 01:39:21,994
to discuss these important matters
of the world.

811
01:39:23,751 --> 01:39:26,950
My experience of such things
is limited.

812
01:39:28,484 --> 01:39:30,978
I am a simple Buddhist monk.

813
01:39:31,073 --> 01:39:35,484
All I know is the scripture
and the words of Lord Buddha.

814
01:39:35,547 --> 01:39:40,535
He sald, "All beings tremble
before danger and death.

815
01:39:40,663 --> 01:39:42,453
Life is dear to all.

816
01:39:42,549 --> 01:39:47,281
When a man considers this,
he does not kill or cause to kill."

817
01:39:47,376 --> 01:39:48,880
You must understand.

818
01:39:48,976 --> 01:39:53,514
These words are ingrained
in the heart of every Tibetan.

819
01:39:53,514 --> 01:39:58,790
It ls why we are a peaceful people
who reject violence on principle.

820
01:40:00,357 --> 01:40:04,641
I pray you will see this is
our greatest strength...

821
01:40:04,641 --> 01:40:06,878
not our weakness.

822
01:40:07,965 --> 01:40:10,203
I thank you for your vislt.

823
01:40:12,952 --> 01:40:16,019
An offering
to the Enlightened Ones.

824
01:40:30,438 --> 01:40:33,220
Rellgion is poison.

825
01:41:37,859 --> 01:41:41,154
The Chinese have attacked
the Tlbetan frontier near Den-Go.

826
01:41:53,300 --> 01:41:57,328
"Today at the dawn, 84,000 troops
of the 1st and 2nd Field Armles...

827
01:41:57,328 --> 01:42:01,547
under the overall command
of General Chang Jing Wu...

828
01:42:01,675 --> 01:42:05,127
attacked the Tibetan frontier
near Den-Go.

829
01:42:05,191 --> 01:42:09,058
The Tibetan army believes
an attack on Chamdo is imminent.

830
01:42:09,122 --> 01:42:12,002
Ngawang Jigme,
our newly appointed governor...

831
01:42:12,002 --> 01:42:14,239
is preparing to send troops
toward the Chinese column...

832
01:42:14,239 --> 01:42:16,988
In order to stop
their progresslon. "

833
01:42:18,139 --> 01:42:21,751
As you know, Chamdo
is the gateway to Tibet.

834
01:42:21,783 --> 01:42:24,500
If Chamdo falls.

835
01:42:24,660 --> 01:42:27,698
If I did not know that, I would not
have been appointed governor.

836
01:42:27,730 --> 01:42:33,006
You do realize our troops are committed
to fighting the Chinese to the last man.

837
01:42:33,133 --> 01:42:35,115
They would rather die than surrender.

838
01:42:36,873 --> 01:42:41,349
Rest assured. there will be no surrender

839
01:45:56,099 --> 01:45:58,337
Radio Lh asa.

840
01:45:59,423 --> 01:46:01,468
Now.

841
01:46:01,563 --> 01:46:04,282
We request permission
to surrender.

842
01:46:04,410 --> 01:46:07,223
- But there will be no surrender--
- I said, "Radio Lh asa."

843
01:46:07,223 --> 01:46:09,780
Permission to surrender now.

844
01:46:54,440 --> 01:46:57,957
We lost the war in 11 days,
Heinrich.

845
01:46:57,990 --> 01:47:00,546
This surrender is
our death sentence.

846
01:47:01,791 --> 01:47:07,099
And I'm afraid our friend
Ngawang Jigme has issued it.

847
01:47:07,227 --> 01:47:12,342
He abandoned Chamdo and then
destroyed the ammunition dumps.

848
01:47:13,621 --> 01:47:16,689
Without weapons and ammunition...

849
01:47:16,752 --> 01:47:19,630
there was no hope for
the troops who wanted to fight.

850
01:47:20,846 --> 01:47:24,011
Our guerrillas could have held
the mountain passes for months...

851
01:47:24,970 --> 01:47:26,792
even years.

852
01:47:26,792 --> 01:47:31,556
It would have bought us time to make
appeals for help to other nations.

853
01:47:31,619 --> 01:47:33,890
Now it's lost.

854
01:47:33,954 --> 01:47:36,095
They broke down the gates.

855
01:48:22,448 --> 01:48:24,493
Hello, my friend.

856
01:48:31,144 --> 01:48:32,999
We did what was the best
for our country...

857
01:48:34,021 --> 01:48:35,907
for Tibet.

858
01:48:37,090 --> 01:48:41,215
On the way to Lhasa, I would see
Tibetans wearing these jackets.

859
01:48:41,343 --> 01:48:43,453
"Chinese soldiers.
Very nice.

860
01:48:43,581 --> 01:48:47,800
Glve food, clothes, money.
Very nice."

861
01:48:47,961 --> 01:48:51,380
It's strange to me that something
so harmless as a jacket...

862
01:48:51,476 --> 01:48:55,121
could symbolize
such a great lie.

863
01:48:59,628 --> 01:49:02,152
After all these years, you still
do not understand Tibetan ways.

864
01:49:03,369 --> 01:49:06,756
To return a gift is unforgivable.

865
01:49:09,665 --> 01:49:12,990
A man who betrays his culture
should not preach about its customs.

866
01:49:19,544 --> 01:49:22,326
There was a time
I would have wished you dead...

867
01:49:22,421 --> 01:49:24,562
but your shame
will be your torture.

868
01:49:24,689 --> 01:49:27,888
And your torture
will be your life.

869
01:49:27,951 --> 01:49:30,189
I wish it to be long.

870
01:49:41,474 --> 01:49:44,159
We pray that His Holiness,
the Dalai Lama...

871
01:49:44,223 --> 01:49:48,029
will be granted the power
to unify his people.

872
01:49:48,092 --> 01:49:52,823
We humbly ask the Tibetan government
to honor our request...

873
01:49:52,823 --> 01:49:56,852
and let the Dalai Lama
attain his political majority.

874
01:50:49,119 --> 01:50:52,092
You have the entire palace
in a panlc.

875
01:50:53,945 --> 01:50:56,568
I'm hiding from the world
for a day.

876
01:50:59,477 --> 01:51:02,130
Kind of difficult
in a glasshouse, no?

877
01:51:07,691 --> 01:51:09,802
It's The Moonlight...

878
01:51:09,994 --> 01:51:11,849
by Debussy.

879
01:51:14,470 --> 01:51:17,701
What else do you know
about this song?

880
01:52:51,941 --> 01:52:54,369
Him, him and him.

881
01:53:06,741 --> 01:53:10,450
I hope you've received your invitation
to the enthronement ceremony.

882
01:53:10,578 --> 01:53:11,730
Yes. Thank you.

883
01:53:11,857 --> 01:53:14,320
- It's next week.
- Th ank you.

884
01:53:27,489 --> 01:53:30,430
Do I look like an egghead?

885
01:53:30,430 --> 01:53:32,637
No, they suit you.

886
01:53:34,905 --> 01:53:37,239
We have a saying in Tibet...

887
01:53:37,303 --> 01:53:41,652
"If the problem can be solved,
there is no use worrying about it.

888
01:53:41,652 --> 01:53:44,434
If it can't be solved.

889
01:53:45,775 --> 01:53:47,119
So stop worrying.

890
01:53:48,557 --> 01:53:52,840
You have to leave Tibet.
Your life's at great risk.

891
01:53:54,438 --> 01:53:58,978
Forgive my presumption, but I made
arrangements to get you out safely.

892
01:53:59,011 --> 01:54:02,560
We should leave after the enthronement.
The Chinese would never expect it--

893
01:54:02,655 --> 01:54:07,641
How can I help people if I run away from
them? What kind of leader would I be?

894
01:54:09,464 --> 01:54:11,638
I have to stay here.

895
01:54:11,702 --> 01:54:13,972
Serving others
is my path to liberation .

896
01:54:24,425 --> 01:54:27,303
- Then I don't go either.
- Why not?

897
01:54:27,366 --> 01:54:30,435
Because you are my path
to liberation.

898
01:54:32,417 --> 01:54:37,403
The Buddha sald. "Salvation

899
01:54:37,530 --> 01:54:41,015
It demands strenuous effort
and practice.

900
01:54:41,078 --> 01:54:45,682
So work hard and seek
your own salvation diligently."

901
01:54:48,114 --> 01:54:50,351
I am not your son...

902
01:54:51,758 --> 01:54:54,474
and I never thought of you
as my father.

903
01:54:55,626 --> 01:54:58,472
You were much too informal
with me for that.

904
01:55:09,308 --> 01:55:11,610
Do you ever think about him?

905
01:55:25,134 --> 01:55:27,467
And wh at do you think about?

906
01:55:38,238 --> 01:55:41,980
It's not the conscious thought
really.

907
01:55:42,108 --> 01:55:44,346
It's just always there.

908
01:55:52,496 --> 01:55:55,566
When I crossed Tibet,
he was with me.

909
01:55:55,598 --> 01:55:57,868
When I came to Lhasa.

910
01:55:57,995 --> 01:56:00,105
When I sit beside you,
he's...

911
01:56:02,024 --> 01:56:03,942
there with me.

912
01:56:08,129 --> 01:56:12,127
I can't even imagine how I pictured
the world without him in it.

913
01:56:14,970 --> 01:56:17,977
Then you should go home
and be his father.

914
01:56:24,881 --> 01:56:26,639
I know.

915
01:56:28,398 --> 01:56:31,050
You have finished
your job with me.

916
01:56:34,024 --> 01:56:35,974
But you have to stay
for my enthronement.

917
01:56:36,102 --> 01:56:39,459
I want you to see me
in all my pomp and glory.

918
01:56:42,401 --> 01:56:44,477
It'd be a pleasure, my friend.

919
01:57:59,794 --> 01:58:02,000
From the government of Tibet...

920
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,558
to Your Holin ess,
the fourteenth Dalai Lama...

921
01:58:04,654 --> 01:58:06,476
we ask you to rule your people...

922
01:58:06,571 --> 01:58:10,983
as the spiritual and
temporal leader of Tibet.

923
01:58:16,577 --> 01:58:20,638
By your prayers and wishes,
I humbly accept.

924
01:59:14,025 --> 01:59:16,774
Butter tea.
It was never my cup of tea.

925
01:59:20,099 --> 01:59:23,998
- One was enough.
- Yes, we must follow the custom.

926
01:59:24,128 --> 01:59:28,699
A fresh cup of tea is poured
for the loved one departing.

927
01:59:33,460 --> 01:59:37,457
It sits untouched,
walting for hls return.

928
02:00:36,119 --> 02:00:40,116
May all travelers find happiness
wherever they go.

929
02:00:40,276 --> 02:00:45,293
Without any effort may they accomplish
whatever they set out to do.

930
02:00:45,293 --> 02:00:48,426
And having safely
returned to the shore...

931
02:00:48,426 --> 02:00:53,093
may they be joyfully reunited
with their relatives.

932
02:01:04,347 --> 02:01:05,625
Mr. Harrer...

933
02:01:09,462 --> 02:01:10,804
from His Holiness.

934
02:02:39,805 --> 02:02:42,297
- Hello, Horst.
- Hello, Heinrich.

935
02:02:42,329 --> 02:02:45,974
Rolf, come out to meet him.

936
02:02:46,008 --> 02:02:48,819
No, I don't want to.

937
02:02:50,450 --> 02:02:51,760
May l?

938
02:04:27,441 --> 02:04:30,158
Rolf, take your time.

939
02:04:46,463 --> 02:04:48,444
Well done, son.

940
02:04:49,467 --> 02:04:50,810
Well done.

941
02:09:57,495 --> 02:10:11,773
THE END
