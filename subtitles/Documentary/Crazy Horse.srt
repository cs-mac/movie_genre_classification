1
00:02:13,047 --> 00:02:15,117
Paroxysm

2
00:02:17,407 --> 00:02:19,159
of Eroticism

3
00:02:21,287 --> 00:02:23,403
Paroxysm

4
00:02:25,767 --> 00:02:28,725
of Exoticism

5
00:02:29,207 --> 00:02:32,961
The Eternal Lesson of Seduction

6
00:02:37,327 --> 00:02:41,206
The Eternal Lesson of Seduction

7
00:02:45,607 --> 00:02:49,964
The Eternal Pleasure of Desire

8
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:56,566
Seduction

9
00:02:58,327 --> 00:03:00,124
Seduction

10
00:10:27,407 --> 00:10:28,556
- Hello.
- How's it going?

11
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:29,916
Just fine, you?

12
00:10:36,127 --> 00:10:38,243
Who's that guy over there?

13
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,796
It's Volga!

14
00:11:04,887 --> 00:11:07,765
That's the Crazy Horse.
You want to put the shadow film on?

15
00:11:10,607 --> 00:11:12,962
What's the name of the
shadow film again?

16
00:11:13,087 --> 00:11:14,759
"Bernardine" was what you
called it a little while ago.

17
00:11:14,847 --> 00:11:17,884
Yeah that works.  Do you mind
opening the curtain all the way?

18
00:11:20,327 --> 00:11:21,680
love that clapboard.

19
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:45,561
Can you kill the floodlights please?

20
00:11:54,407 --> 00:11:57,285
That's it.
Arch it, arch it. . .

21
00:11:58,487 --> 00:12:00,478
Push your body forward more.

22
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:02,964
That's it, arch it.

23
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:14,205
How long have we got?
Two hours?

24
00:12:15,007 --> 00:12:16,963
Koko, Lumina, Zola. . .

25
00:12:22,127 --> 00:12:23,526
Let's do that again.

26
00:13:32,447 --> 00:13:35,564
Stretch, shrug, stretch, shrug. . .

27
00:13:58,207 --> 00:14:00,562
Thanks, girls. You can go
back to the dressing room now.

28
00:14:00,727 --> 00:14:02,080
Take a shower.
Two of them, even.

29
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,082
Are you listening?

30
00:14:04,127 --> 00:14:07,802
You can't touch the strip of mirrors
on the side of the netting.

31
00:14:09,047 --> 00:14:11,242
We're going to need to
see some lights.

32
00:14:11,287 --> 00:14:13,323
Can you come
down here please?

33
00:14:16,487 --> 00:14:19,479
Should the letters be in the middle?

34
00:14:21,647 --> 00:14:22,602
Yeah.

35
00:14:22,807 --> 00:14:26,641
Is the backdrop centered?
It might not be perfectly centered.

36
00:14:28,247 --> 00:14:30,078
Is it really perfectly centered?

37
00:14:31,407 --> 00:14:34,001
That's what we said,
you'll have to end up that way.

38
00:14:37,447 --> 00:14:38,675
Then you go up. . .

39
00:14:39,447 --> 00:14:40,846
And do a turn.

40
00:14:41,767 --> 00:14:43,120
That's it.

41
00:14:44,807 --> 00:14:46,445
Now I pull off your skirt.

42
00:14:47,327 --> 00:14:48,885
You slide down. . .

43
00:14:53,367 --> 00:14:55,403
First I turn around like this. . .

44
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:05,647
And then. . .

45
00:15:05,647 --> 00:15:07,683
I help you go up.

46
00:15:09,727 --> 00:15:12,639
You grab yourself and do an
undulating movement.

47
00:15:15,687 --> 00:15:17,006
And again.

48
00:15:19,007 --> 00:15:21,396
The same thing.
My body against yours.

49
00:15:22,407 --> 00:15:25,524
I make a gesture, and you move away.
Like so.

50
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:51,276
Then, arms back with the music.

51
00:15:52,127 --> 00:15:55,961
We come back with a
broader movement. . .

52
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:02,445
And we turn around.

53
00:16:03,647 --> 00:16:05,922
Did you get it?  Want to try?

54
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:08,044
Lada paused a bit.

55
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:17,525
OK, Zula, the closed eyes
look real good.

56
00:16:17,647 --> 00:16:21,117
It makes you look relaxed,
like you're in a state of abandon.

57
00:16:26,447 --> 00:16:28,358
And you change position. . .

58
00:16:36,927 --> 00:16:37,996
Three. . .

59
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,436
Four. . .

60
00:16:43,727 --> 00:16:45,638
Careful now,
with meaning...

61
00:16:45,687 --> 00:16:46,802
One!

62
00:16:47,967 --> 00:16:49,116
Three. . .

63
00:16:50,047 --> 00:16:53,039
OK it's hot, you're gonna
open your helmet now. . .

64
00:16:54,367 --> 00:16:59,043
Three, two, three, four. . .

65
00:17:01,447 --> 00:17:03,005
You get up slowly.

66
00:17:04,487 --> 00:17:07,957
You're still really hot.
So hot you have to get up.

67
00:17:17,007 --> 00:17:18,918
OK here comes Lumina.

68
00:17:46,847 --> 00:17:48,360
head over to the peephole.

69
00:17:50,047 --> 00:17:52,083
Go over to the
peephole, Lumina.

70
00:17:57,847 --> 00:17:59,485
Look at each other.

71
00:18:09,327 --> 00:18:10,965
And it's going to
change again. . .

72
00:18:12,087 --> 00:18:15,841
OK leave the peephole...
And appear on the other side.

73
00:18:21,607 --> 00:18:23,086
First contact.

74
00:18:24,927 --> 00:18:26,963
That's it!
Second contact.

75
00:18:28,967 --> 00:18:31,117
You're gonna make contact
in front of the peephole.

76
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:34,597
Lumina, you're too far upstage,
and Zola, you're too far back.

77
00:18:34,687 --> 00:18:36,598
Again in front of the peephole.

78
00:18:36,687 --> 00:18:38,564
OK come off
the conveyor belt. . .

79
00:18:41,047 --> 00:18:42,321
Now give a kiss.

80
00:18:46,807 --> 00:18:47,842
On your knees now...

81
00:19:03,007 --> 00:19:04,360
Body back.

82
00:19:05,927 --> 00:19:07,121
Lower that butt.

83
00:19:14,447 --> 00:19:15,766
And now start.

84
00:19:19,447 --> 00:19:20,800
That's it.

85
00:19:27,247 --> 00:19:28,396
Come together. . .

86
00:19:37,247 --> 00:19:38,475
and separate. . .

87
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:50,078
Now come together again.

88
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:55,638
Now you can do something
to end it.

89
00:20:04,367 --> 00:20:06,562
You need to work on perfecting
that approach.

90
00:20:07,047 --> 00:20:08,116
That thing scares me!

91
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:09,395
Very good.

92
00:20:13,047 --> 00:20:15,845
We need to turn off
the stage lights.

93
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:20,237
Girls, change places.
You, the three new girls:

94
00:20:26,447 --> 00:20:28,403
Stay close together.

95
00:20:28,607 --> 00:20:30,677
Try to really feel each other.

96
00:20:59,487 --> 00:21:02,365
Yasna, you're doing good on the right,
but not so good on the left.

97
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,803
Curve your hand a bit, Yasna.

98
00:21:11,247 --> 00:21:17,277
Bend your right hand.
Not too much. Higher.

99
00:21:20,047 --> 00:21:21,116
Perfect.

100
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:29,122
Thanks.

101
00:21:36,247 --> 00:21:38,715
The issue of lighting is different.

102
00:21:38,927 --> 00:21:44,399
We got rid of the "Vestal"
to free up all the side lights.

103
00:21:44,767 --> 00:21:48,726
They were all blocked
with black light for the "Vestal."

104
00:21:48,847 --> 00:21:51,407
Now that we don't have the "Vestal" ,
we'll be able to use them

105
00:21:51,487 --> 00:21:54,479
and change the colors
on the sides.

106
00:21:54,607 --> 00:21:58,566
This work is going to require. . .
I'm speaking in your name, here...

107
00:21:58,727 --> 00:22:01,685
That we take this
opportunity to clean the lights;

108
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:05,203
they have a whole layer of
dust on them.

109
00:22:05,527 --> 00:22:09,566
Then we are going to need to really
carefully go over all the show lights,

110
00:22:09,847 --> 00:22:11,644
with the girls fully clothed,

111
00:22:11,727 --> 00:22:16,005
to see what needs to be
changed about the side lights.

112
00:22:16,247 --> 00:22:19,762
The side lights are the ones
that really give the body definition,

113
00:22:19,847 --> 00:22:22,077
and they're the basic lights
for dance.

114
00:22:22,247 --> 00:22:26,001
They define the bodies
and delineate them.

115
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:28,362
We need to take better
advantage of that.

116
00:22:28,487 --> 00:22:32,366
And this overall revision
brings me back to my usual request:

117
00:22:32,887 --> 00:22:38,325
If we could just close the place to
do it for a little while; otherwise we..

118
00:22:38,487 --> 00:22:41,843
Philippe, I'm sorry,
but the answer is no.

119
00:22:42,207 --> 00:22:43,322
We aren't going to close.

120
00:22:44,327 --> 00:22:46,795
I'd really like it if you'd think it
over because otherwise we can't do it.

121
00:22:47,007 --> 00:22:48,486
It'd be better to talk to
Philippe L'Homme.

122
00:22:48,527 --> 00:22:50,563
I know that he's going to say no.

123
00:22:50,647 --> 00:22:54,003
Well if we really want the place
to make a big step forward,

124
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:57,079
in terms of the quality
of the show. . .

125
00:22:57,487 --> 00:23:01,162
We want this to be the greatest
nude dancing show in the world

126
00:23:01,927 --> 00:23:04,646
and we're trying to really
remake the whole genre,

127
00:23:05,287 --> 00:23:07,755
then we need
the means to do it.

128
00:23:08,247 --> 00:23:12,240
If we want to have an opening
that intelligent viewers will love,

129
00:23:12,407 --> 00:23:13,886
it's going to have to be like that.

130
00:23:14,007 --> 00:23:16,885
There are certain things we just can't
do without closing for a little while.

131
00:23:19,447 --> 00:23:22,678
All I can do is pass on
the shareholders' opinion,

132
00:23:22,927 --> 00:23:25,282
which has been the same
for a whole year.

133
00:23:25,607 --> 00:23:29,316
I don't see that there's absolutely
no way to do it in a legal sense.

134
00:23:29,687 --> 00:23:34,124
I understand that it would be a
problem to pay sixty people for nothing.

135
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:37,805
A few of them could even
do some work, helping clean the lights.

136
00:23:37,967 --> 00:23:41,403
But there has to be some kind
of a solution we can find. . .

137
00:23:42,567 --> 00:23:45,035
There are plenty companies where
people stop work for a bit . . .

138
00:23:45,887 --> 00:23:47,206
They take vacations.

139
00:23:47,287 --> 00:23:49,437
And they don't go bankrupt or anything.
It really is perfectly feasible.

140
00:23:51,007 --> 00:23:53,237
I don't know, I'd like to find
some kind of solution.

141
00:23:53,327 --> 00:23:56,160
I just still think that if we want to
have a really classy show September 1st

142
00:23:56,247 --> 00:23:58,317
we're going to have to
close for a minute to set it up.

143
00:23:58,407 --> 00:24:01,524
The shareholders won't accept
the idea of closing up shop.

144
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:04,605
There will come a time when
they'll have to understand.

145
00:24:05,287 --> 00:24:09,041
- They have their needs, but so do we.
- I agree.

146
00:24:09,327 --> 00:24:11,921
They want us to put
on a quality show here,

147
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,676
and that has
certain implications.

148
00:24:15,647 --> 00:24:17,524
Among which is closing for a bit.

149
00:24:17,567 --> 00:24:19,797
Otherwise quality
will be compromised.

150
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:23,078
And I'd be the first one to
feel disappointed about that.

151
00:24:23,567 --> 00:24:26,206
I think it's really important.

152
00:24:26,287 --> 00:24:29,404
I'm not trying to cheat anyone,
I really just think it's important.

153
00:24:29,967 --> 00:24:35,803
When you see how effective
our "Evolution" show is. . .

154
00:24:36,167 --> 00:24:39,398
I mean, these are pieces we've been
working on for years now.

155
00:24:40,087 --> 00:24:43,762
It's really inhuman to give us
only one or two weeks to do all that.

156
00:24:43,847 --> 00:24:48,204
We have to have the same amount of room
that we had for "Evolution,"

157
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:50,960
we worked on that for years.

158
00:24:51,087 --> 00:24:54,636
I can put all my best effort,
all my talent into it

159
00:24:57,087 --> 00:25:00,523
but I'll still be mistaken about some
things and we have to work them out.

160
00:25:00,647 --> 00:25:05,641
I can't produce three
new pieces blindly.

161
00:25:06,327 --> 00:25:10,479
The finale is really important too,
and we need a new. . .

162
00:25:10,767 --> 00:25:13,600
well, give me an estimate
of how much time you'll need.

163
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:16,998
The finale, by the end of July.

164
00:25:17,087 --> 00:25:20,045
I've asked for more time
three times already,

165
00:25:20,167 --> 00:25:22,397
I'm under a lot of pressure here.

166
00:25:22,807 --> 00:25:24,081
I mean, I'm always trying
to get more...

167
00:25:24,207 --> 00:25:27,005
We have to think about
what it means to create this.

168
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:28,880
I agree, but. . .

169
00:25:30,047 --> 00:25:32,242
If we're going to have a new finale,

170
00:25:32,327 --> 00:25:35,922
and we manage to fix up the transitions,

171
00:25:36,127 --> 00:25:40,166
we'd basically have a whole new show.
Don't you agree?

172
00:25:40,447 --> 00:25:44,645
We'd have four or five old numbers
instead of three,

173
00:25:46,447 --> 00:25:49,245
but the general spirit of the whole
show would be really changed.

174
00:25:49,327 --> 00:25:52,717
If we change the intervals
and the overall sequence. . .

175
00:25:53,327 --> 00:25:56,876
I agree with you,
but the shareholders aren't into it.

176
00:25:57,087 --> 00:25:59,920
They've said they only want
to see three of the old numbers.

177
00:26:00,167 --> 00:26:02,158
- I can explain this to them.
- OK.

178
00:26:02,487 --> 00:26:04,205
I can't say any more.

179
00:26:04,327 --> 00:26:07,683
They constantly say
that this wasn't what they agreed to.

180
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:11,396
Creativity isn't something that
can exist in a controlled environment.

181
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:14,001
I know they're thinking
in business terms,

182
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:16,477
but all the same -
this is still art.

183
00:26:17,887 --> 00:26:22,005
It's like if they ordered a painting

184
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:25,596
where there was the sun over here
and some cows over here,

185
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:29,559
and they wanted the cows somewhere
else. It's art! You can't just do that!

186
00:26:29,647 --> 00:26:33,242
Maybe it would be good if you
went in to defend your position.

187
00:26:34,807 --> 00:26:37,526
But I do agree with you completely.

188
00:26:38,287 --> 00:26:40,676
OK so we're going to do a program
for all of Summer right?

189
00:26:40,887 --> 00:26:42,878
I also want to do "Venus" .

190
00:26:43,167 --> 00:26:46,762
- What happened with that number?
- Didn't I tell you already?

191
00:26:46,887 --> 00:26:50,482
It's happened several times that
the girls ran off the stage crying.

192
00:26:50,847 --> 00:26:52,405
They don't like touching themselves.

193
00:26:52,767 --> 00:26:54,359
They don't like touching each other
like that either.

194
00:26:54,607 --> 00:26:57,440
It's like, there's a very strange
culture here actually.

195
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:01,165
Contrary to what it might seem,
these girls aren't really sluts...

196
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:02,879
And they don't like doing that kind
of thing.

197
00:27:06,807 --> 00:27:08,525
They're quite prudish really.

198
00:27:08,967 --> 00:27:11,720
When we ask them to
get a little closer to each other,

199
00:27:11,807 --> 00:27:14,719
it's like they run up against
an invisible wall.

200
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,765
They can't get past a certain point.

201
00:27:20,287 --> 00:27:22,596
They have a hard tiime
acting the fool.

202
00:27:22,727 --> 00:27:25,560
Not many of them are really
able to do it.

203
00:27:26,367 --> 00:27:28,597
We'd really need to work
on that number,

204
00:27:28,687 --> 00:27:31,076
to make it more interesting
from a technical perspective.

205
00:27:31,127 --> 00:27:33,880
Zula had an idea that I liked
but that we'd still need to test out,

206
00:27:33,967 --> 00:27:36,845
which was puting ski boots
on the rotating cage.

207
00:27:36,967 --> 00:27:41,961
the main astronaut girl could
lean in all directions.

208
00:27:42,487 --> 00:27:44,762
It might be fun and interesting,

209
00:27:44,887 --> 00:27:48,243
but it would mean some work
and it'd be a technical challenge.

210
00:27:49,607 --> 00:27:50,722
We'll see.

211
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:30,725
Can we see the second group?

212
00:28:34,567 --> 00:28:36,637
We're a centimeter and
a half off here.

213
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:41,320
Start it.

214
00:28:41,407 --> 00:28:43,557
And the third time start again. . .

215
00:28:44,647 --> 00:28:45,921
. . . and go over there.

216
00:28:47,527 --> 00:28:49,006
Then continue. . .

217
00:28:50,567 --> 00:28:51,886
OK you're too. . .

218
00:28:53,367 --> 00:28:55,722
You have to do it all
from the side.

219
00:28:56,047 --> 00:28:57,844
That makes it a lot better.

220
00:28:59,767 --> 00:29:01,359
It's the shadow dance.

221
00:29:02,927 --> 00:29:03,916
Go on.

222
00:29:05,007 --> 00:29:05,917
One. . .

223
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,202
And two. . .

224
00:29:10,367 --> 00:29:13,040
Next a little explanation
about the shadows.

225
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:14,480
I orient my body. . .

226
00:29:15,007 --> 00:29:18,682
The focus is like a camera lens,
the focus is here.

227
00:29:19,247 --> 00:29:21,203
It's a bit strange,

228
00:29:21,247 --> 00:29:24,398
but the movements need
to be like that

229
00:29:25,007 --> 00:29:27,567
otherwise it's like you
have no neck.

230
00:29:30,247 --> 00:29:32,363
Give a bit better definition to
the little cat-pounces.

231
00:29:33,167 --> 00:29:37,080
When you do a cat-pounce,
slide to the side a bit.

232
00:29:37,407 --> 00:29:40,205
Don't just stand there....
that's it, go to the side.

233
00:29:44,487 --> 00:29:47,399
OK girls it's 6 pm,
let's call it a day.

234
00:29:48,647 --> 00:29:50,478
Thanks a lot, girls.

235
00:30:42,367 --> 00:30:45,439
Perfect. Diamond Category.
What restaurant?

236
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:50,244
"Devez" or "Francis" ?

237
00:30:51,207 --> 00:30:52,481
Very good.

238
00:30:52,607 --> 00:30:54,006
For two?

239
00:30:57,407 --> 00:30:59,637
What name should I put down
for the reservation?

240
00:31:04,287 --> 00:31:06,482
Your first name please.

241
00:31:06,527 --> 00:31:07,676
Michel. . .

242
00:31:07,767 --> 00:31:10,600
Can I get your cell phone number?

243
00:31:12,207 --> 00:31:13,686
Will you want to be
billed separately?

244
00:31:19,207 --> 00:31:22,438
Good evening. They're going on stage
in 25 minutes.

245
00:31:27,967 --> 00:31:31,437
Good evening, call up a dancer
to the control room please.

246
00:31:32,487 --> 00:31:33,681
Just a dancer?
Any dancer at all?

247
00:31:34,167 --> 00:31:36,886
- Zula, I gave you the. . .
- Yeah, thanks.

248
00:31:44,647 --> 00:31:48,003
I simply adore the show.
there's a few things that need revising,

249
00:31:48,127 --> 00:31:50,277
Like whether or not to
use wigs,

250
00:31:51,407 --> 00:31:55,400
but the music is really happy and fun.
It sticks in your head.

251
00:31:59,287 --> 00:32:01,676
What I don't like is the finale.

252
00:32:03,207 --> 00:32:09,646
We really need to work on that;
even more than on the finale.

253
00:32:10,127 --> 00:32:11,116
In what respect?

254
00:32:11,367 --> 00:32:14,643
It's missing something...
it has no thrust to it.

255
00:32:23,407 --> 00:32:24,726
Good evening.

256
00:32:26,407 --> 00:32:27,442
Thanks.

257
00:32:31,167 --> 00:32:33,158
- It's us.
- Indeed. . .

258
00:32:33,287 --> 00:32:35,084
Somewhere over here.

259
00:32:35,167 --> 00:32:36,725
- Here?
- Maybe.

260
00:32:37,927 --> 00:32:40,999
Take this gentleman to 41 7.

261
00:32:41,567 --> 00:32:43,478
He was in 212.

262
00:32:44,407 --> 00:32:46,523
I hope you like the show.

263
00:32:46,887 --> 00:32:47,876
Good evening.

264
00:33:05,127 --> 00:33:06,526
Say cheese!

265
00:43:20,207 --> 00:43:21,879
He's got to be nuts!

266
00:43:32,567 --> 00:43:35,798
He's a star in Russia,
he's a Bolshoi soloist.

267
00:43:37,327 --> 00:43:39,283
He's popular everywhere.

268
00:43:39,407 --> 00:43:41,716
He's got a good physique.

269
00:43:45,607 --> 00:43:46,676
This is really unique...

270
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:22,403
The ground looks slippery.

271
00:44:22,527 --> 00:44:24,199
They're dance rugs.

272
00:44:26,847 --> 00:44:28,200
Looks hard.

273
00:44:29,887 --> 00:44:31,286
It's really hard.

274
00:44:31,807 --> 00:44:33,001
And you can tell.

275
00:44:40,527 --> 00:44:42,006
Pretty funny huh?

276
00:45:15,887 --> 00:45:17,605
We can hardly make it out...

277
00:45:18,407 --> 00:45:21,558
We see the darkness
of a long robe trailing along.

278
00:45:21,687 --> 00:45:24,645
We can make out the white
of a Summer dress...

279
00:45:25,567 --> 00:45:27,398
I am but a shadow.

280
00:45:28,047 --> 00:45:30,686
And you... are light.

281
00:51:56,767 --> 00:51:58,917
- Are you in that "Scanner" number?
- No.

282
00:51:59,007 --> 00:52:02,920
But you could try it out,
if you don't mind.

283
00:52:03,087 --> 00:52:05,806
There's going to be a
switch in scenes.

284
00:52:05,927 --> 00:52:08,600
We might not end up doing
the "lnfra-red" number

285
00:52:10,287 --> 00:52:12,005
until the weekend.

286
00:52:13,607 --> 00:52:14,722
Did you already know that?

287
00:52:14,927 --> 00:52:18,442
Yeah, they decided yesterday.
Philippe let me know a bit ago.

288
00:52:19,407 --> 00:52:22,046
"Scanner" is far from ready.

289
00:52:22,327 --> 00:52:24,283
but we'll try to get it finished.

290
00:52:26,327 --> 00:52:29,160
If this lady doesn't mind
taking that off. . .

291
00:52:29,367 --> 00:52:33,519
And we'll try out something
new for the "Venus" number.

292
00:52:36,247 --> 00:52:38,124
It'll be more like. . .

293
00:52:40,287 --> 00:52:41,959
a Formula 1 car
race championship.

294
00:52:46,767 --> 00:52:51,318
Jérôme also told me yesterday
that we'll need to try out dresses.

295
00:52:51,727 --> 00:52:54,287
- Alright.
- The new dresses. . .

296
00:52:55,647 --> 00:52:56,602
For you.

297
00:52:57,687 --> 00:53:02,283
You really want to change it?
The one I'm using now is great.

298
00:53:03,967 --> 00:53:08,916
The material looks really
nice with the lights.

299
00:53:09,807 --> 00:53:13,925
It's pretty, but there's
something bothering me about it.

300
00:53:14,487 --> 00:53:23,202
The material really shines when you're
dancing while leaning over the table,

301
00:53:23,847 --> 00:53:26,520
and instead of making your
butt look nice and round,

302
00:53:26,647 --> 00:53:28,558
it makes it look bony.

303
00:53:30,007 --> 00:53:33,602
The light draws an outline
of your ass.

304
00:53:33,727 --> 00:53:35,240
it makes. . .

305
00:53:35,727 --> 00:53:39,561
your ass look bony and not round.

306
00:53:40,727 --> 00:53:43,639
the new dress,

307
00:53:44,647 --> 00:53:47,366
since the material is duller,
it gives more accent to the curves.

308
00:53:47,447 --> 00:53:49,324
the light doesn't catch
on it,

309
00:53:49,487 --> 00:53:53,400
and it's more elegant
for that executive look.

310
00:53:54,127 --> 00:53:56,163
it's got a more elegant touch.

311
00:53:57,287 --> 00:53:59,926
I also loved the other material,

312
00:54:00,127 --> 00:54:01,446
but with the light. . .

313
00:54:01,847 --> 00:54:04,998
it's just too shiny.

314
00:54:09,087 --> 00:54:10,964
it doesn't really favor the silhouette.

315
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:17,236
We want to show
nice round asses

316
00:54:17,487 --> 00:54:19,079
but that isn't what we get with this.

317
00:54:20,127 --> 00:54:25,759
we also thought the material
was too fragile

318
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:29,759
for constant use.

319
00:54:30,407 --> 00:54:33,399
but meanwhile you can use it.

320
00:54:33,647 --> 00:54:35,877
but let's try out the new one.

321
00:54:36,247 --> 00:54:39,444
Daisy already did
and it looked great.

322
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:40,966
Come in, Jérôme.

323
00:54:41,047 --> 00:54:43,322
I had a hard time undressing
this girl.

324
00:54:44,007 --> 00:54:48,364
you can undress in the booth there
and then come with me.

325
00:54:51,367 --> 00:54:54,200
got anything for me
to put on my feet?

326
00:54:54,607 --> 00:54:56,120
want some flip flops?

327
00:54:56,367 --> 00:54:57,766
i'll get them.

328
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:27,203
you're off time again.

329
00:57:30,967 --> 00:57:33,197
the three in back are doing
something different.

330
00:58:02,927 --> 00:58:05,646
What Lumina is doing is cute.

331
00:58:11,167 --> 00:58:13,601
they look a bit like cheerleaders. . .

332
00:58:27,167 --> 00:58:28,998
I'm satisfied today.

333
00:58:29,167 --> 00:58:30,998
OK, we're moving forward;
everything's going fine.

334
00:58:31,607 --> 00:58:34,758
I'm going to make a list of what
they asked me to revise; it's huge.

335
00:58:34,847 --> 00:58:37,680
And the finale?
is it "No Way" ?

336
00:58:38,287 --> 00:58:39,766
Yeah, today it's "No Way" .

337
00:58:40,607 --> 00:58:43,246
- Tomorrow it will be "No" .
- I'm tired of asking over and over.

338
00:58:43,487 --> 00:58:46,081
- I'm a little bit. . .
- Stubborn.

339
00:58:46,687 --> 00:58:49,326
But since I also try to
give them what they want. . .

340
00:58:51,967 --> 00:58:55,164
When I talked to the boss,
he seemed satisfied.

341
00:58:55,647 --> 00:58:57,046
It's all good.

342
00:58:58,047 --> 00:59:02,802
I went to meet him and said:
"Fire me; I didn't satisfy my contract.

343
00:59:03,327 --> 00:59:06,046
"I take responsibility,
but I want to justify myself.

344
00:59:07,327 --> 00:59:10,000
"There are various problems
we really need to resolve.

345
00:59:11,367 --> 00:59:13,517
"If sometimes I may not
be efficient,

346
00:59:13,647 --> 00:59:16,559
"it's for reasons that are
out of my control.

347
00:59:19,607 --> 00:59:21,996
"We take two steps forward
and one step back,

348
00:59:22,087 --> 00:59:24,726
"We cancel numbers like
"Venus" and "Scanner" . . .

349
00:59:25,807 --> 00:59:28,162
"I don't just agree with everything
every day.

350
00:59:29,567 --> 00:59:32,206
"If you find someone who will,
please go ahead and hire him."

351
00:59:32,327 --> 00:59:34,238
Aside from that, are you satisfied?

352
00:59:34,407 --> 00:59:36,318
I am passionate about my work.

353
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:38,915
Right now my work
is the Crazy Horse show

354
00:59:39,447 --> 00:59:42,007
and that takes up all my time.

355
00:59:42,167 --> 00:59:45,079
I see what's wrong and try
to fix it.

356
00:59:45,207 --> 00:59:48,643
For the rest, when nothing's wrong,
I leave it alone.

357
00:59:49,487 --> 00:59:52,320
But sometimes,
I get really disturbed.

358
00:59:52,607 --> 00:59:55,360
When I see a show
like the one we had last night,

359
00:59:55,487 --> 00:59:58,399
where we had excellent
dancers and technical teams,

360
00:59:58,487 --> 01:00:01,126
compared to other,
weaker shows. . .

361
01:00:01,247 --> 01:00:04,319
But even so there were some
little errors in all the numbers.

362
01:00:04,447 --> 01:00:07,325
What I'm frightened of is that
margin of error.

363
01:00:07,407 --> 01:00:09,841
The day before yesterday the
infrared lights broke down. . .

364
01:00:10,247 --> 01:00:14,559
It's those little details that
make the show either good or bad.

365
01:00:14,727 --> 01:00:18,481
first it was the "infrared" curtain,
which was all off kilter,

366
01:00:18,927 --> 01:00:20,440
the image wasn't as it
was supposed to be,

367
01:00:20,887 --> 01:00:25,244
then they forgot to put the lace
ove the light on Daisy's butt,

368
01:00:25,367 --> 01:00:29,121
so no one could see anything. . .

369
01:00:29,967 --> 01:00:33,642
this is supposed to be
the world's greatest nude show,

370
01:00:33,727 --> 01:00:36,116
and we're capable of making it happen.

371
01:00:36,247 --> 01:00:38,203
but when something goes wrong,

372
01:00:38,367 --> 01:00:41,165
when we need to wait 10 minutes
before a number starts,

373
01:00:41,287 --> 01:00:43,198
we look ridiculous.

374
01:00:45,007 --> 01:00:48,556
I'm worried because I know
how fragile the team can be.

375
01:00:48,647 --> 01:00:53,846
Bégo talked about creating a
hierarchy in the control structure. . .

376
01:00:53,927 --> 01:00:55,406
That might be interesting. . .

377
01:00:55,487 --> 01:00:58,524
I'm trying to do that.
I've got to talk to Maurizio.

378
01:00:59,127 --> 01:01:01,038
But he's not really convinced.

379
01:01:02,407 --> 01:01:06,446
I think Rico should be
the scene director.

380
01:01:09,287 --> 01:01:10,800
He's a reliable person.

381
01:01:11,127 --> 01:01:16,281
If there's any problem,
people would go talk to him.

382
01:01:17,807 --> 01:01:22,198
When the curtain was all off,
it was nobody's fault.

383
01:01:22,327 --> 01:01:26,445
it's a rule of the house which is
kind of dumb.  Anyone can trade roles.

384
01:01:26,607 --> 01:01:31,044
It may make sense to do that for
dancers, but not for technicians.

385
01:01:31,167 --> 01:01:35,080
yesterday i tried to explain
that to Andrée and the boss:

386
01:01:35,487 --> 01:01:40,561
"imagine that today you're directors,
tomorrow secretaries, then doorkeepers,

387
01:01:40,647 --> 01:01:45,038
and then the next day you're in sales...
It's just impossible."

388
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:48,160
That's why they need to
know how to do everything.

389
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:51,886
They have to know how
to replace each other.

390
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:56,318
The system needs to be
completely changed;

391
01:01:56,687 --> 01:01:59,679
otherwise it will remain
totally fragile.

392
01:01:59,807 --> 01:02:03,356
it's ok that they should all know how
everything's done; they won't need
to do it or anything...

393
01:02:04,327 --> 01:02:06,636
there have to be
specific responsibilities.

394
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:11,563
certain technicians
don't know how to do certain things.

395
01:02:12,447 --> 01:02:15,519
we need to acknolwedge that
and put them in their specific places.

396
01:02:15,967 --> 01:02:18,686
and accept our limitations.

397
01:02:19,687 --> 01:02:22,645
Accept that there are certain
things we don't know how to do.

398
01:02:22,767 --> 01:02:25,679
that's why I don't do the
"Que Calor" number

399
01:02:28,767 --> 01:02:31,645
I'm going to give you a compliment:
you're the greatest.

400
01:02:31,727 --> 01:02:35,003
Even yesterday you did "Que Calor!" .

401
01:02:36,007 --> 01:02:38,760
You don't really like that number,
but you do it anyway.

402
01:02:39,847 --> 01:02:41,917
you make us laugh.
you're funny.

403
01:02:42,007 --> 01:02:44,840
that's generous of you.
it's just the way it has to be.

404
01:02:54,527 --> 01:02:57,405
Today is World Biodiversity Day

405
01:02:57,567 --> 01:03:00,923
and the theme of this show
will be invasive exotic species.

406
01:03:01,087 --> 01:03:05,524
this species
digs holes in the ground.

407
01:03:05,807 --> 01:03:09,322
the water gets muddy.

408
01:04:41,887 --> 01:04:46,358
we have to coordinate the work
methods between the two workshops.

409
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:51,084
we can't be changing
the plans constantly,

410
01:04:51,207 --> 01:04:53,767
cancelling one thing and
starting another,

411
01:04:53,847 --> 01:04:56,441
a new idea,
one girl instead of two. . .

412
01:04:56,527 --> 01:05:00,076
these kinds of constant changes
between the two workshops

413
01:05:01,207 --> 01:05:06,156
were really driving me crazy
the other day.

414
01:05:06,487 --> 01:05:08,523
We're doing a half-assed job,

415
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:10,438
and that's far from the
tradition at this place.

416
01:05:10,567 --> 01:05:14,401
At the production meetings we
don't check over anything,

417
01:05:14,727 --> 01:05:18,800
and I don't really even want to
participate in them because I
have other work to do. . .

418
01:05:19,047 --> 01:05:21,277
Roselyne kept you up to speed.

419
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:25,400
That was what we'd agreed.
The new dates. . .

420
01:05:27,247 --> 01:05:29,761
It's my fault; I admit it.

421
01:05:29,847 --> 01:05:31,724
Things are just constantly changing.

422
01:05:31,847 --> 01:05:35,806
At all the meetings we almost
always end up changing everything.

423
01:05:36,687 --> 01:05:39,201
- But there are reasons for that.
- I know!

424
01:05:39,927 --> 01:05:42,999
- I don't want to waste so much time.
- I try to be. . .

425
01:05:43,687 --> 01:05:48,477
You must understand that it's impossible
for us to do quality work here,

426
01:05:48,727 --> 01:05:51,400
with the same enthusiasm that we
had at first

427
01:05:51,487 --> 01:05:55,799
and with results that make us all proud.

428
01:05:57,167 --> 01:06:01,046
Working this way, all we can
produce is shit.

429
01:06:01,127 --> 01:06:04,881
We can't just do whatever we want
with the Crazy Horse girls.

430
01:06:05,007 --> 01:06:09,205
They do the splits, they expose
themselves to the audience. . .

431
01:06:11,887 --> 01:06:14,560
the girls are naked;
we can't be throwing water around.

432
01:06:14,807 --> 01:06:18,959
the costumes might not be important
to you, but they are to us.

433
01:06:19,087 --> 01:06:21,840
If we don't have time to check
over everything to be sure,

434
01:06:21,967 --> 01:06:25,243
with Andrée,
Roselyne or you. . .

435
01:06:26,207 --> 01:06:29,643
let's agree to have a creative meeting
every week at least;

436
01:06:29,807 --> 01:06:32,685
it's been three weeks that we
haven't had any at all.

437
01:06:34,247 --> 01:06:35,680
there haven't been any
creative meetings.

438
01:06:35,807 --> 01:06:39,720
as for the production meetings,
they really need to be held every week.

439
01:06:41,007 --> 01:06:45,637
What do we do?  I can't go on
like this; I'm going nuts.

440
01:06:46,087 --> 01:06:51,400
I came up with the title "Make me
Crazy," but I wasn't talking literally!

441
01:06:51,727 --> 01:06:54,764
I was talking about the guys in the
audience.  The girls should
make them crazy. . .

442
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:58,556
Not me! I love working,
I love what I do,

443
01:06:58,807 --> 01:07:01,162
I love the girls,
I love making them look pretty.

444
01:07:01,287 --> 01:07:05,041
I can't ruin all of Roselyne's
work, the image of the Crazy Horse club,

445
01:07:05,167 --> 01:07:07,283
I can't ruin myself.

446
01:07:07,807 --> 01:07:11,004
I can't just stay quiet
as a mouse

447
01:07:11,807 --> 01:07:14,719
or say "it's not my fault."
that's absurd.

448
01:07:14,807 --> 01:07:17,002
we have to be proud of what we do.

449
01:07:18,687 --> 01:07:22,157
at first we felt very proud,
but at the end. . .

450
01:07:22,447 --> 01:07:25,519
I don't want to leave the Crazy Horse
in a bad state.

451
01:07:25,967 --> 01:07:28,765
that was the goal of this meeting.

452
01:07:28,927 --> 01:07:32,158
Either we need to agree on
what we're doing from start to finish,

453
01:07:32,407 --> 01:07:36,082
and decide how to divide up the work

454
01:07:36,247 --> 01:07:39,683
and at the end of the week
straighten needles with Thibault,

455
01:07:40,127 --> 01:07:44,598
or if everything just keeps
constantly changing, I'll have to quit.

456
01:07:44,847 --> 01:07:46,997
It would make a lot more
sense for it to be you

457
01:07:47,047 --> 01:07:50,119
that supervises
the whole costume area,

458
01:07:50,287 --> 01:07:51,845
so it is coherent.

459
01:07:51,927 --> 01:07:53,804
that was what they asked me at first.

460
01:07:53,887 --> 01:07:56,276
i think it makes a lot more sense.

461
01:07:58,167 --> 01:08:04,561
i supervise choreography,
music and structure.

462
01:08:05,407 --> 01:08:10,083
If we delegate those tasks to someone
else a lot of confusion will arise.

463
01:08:10,207 --> 01:08:11,799
with the costumes it's the same.

464
01:08:11,887 --> 01:08:15,004
you have to supervise
the costumes as a whole.

465
01:08:15,327 --> 01:08:19,525
as for the method,
I confess I'm a bit lost. . .

466
01:08:20,847 --> 01:08:24,635
we have an approval process,
which Thibault designed.

467
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:27,440
it's normal that there should be
a validation process.

468
01:08:27,887 --> 01:08:33,325
you have to approve it,
and Andrée and Roselyne do too.

469
01:08:33,607 --> 01:08:35,643
all this happens in such
an anarchic way,

470
01:08:35,767 --> 01:08:38,679
where we were all creating
at the same time.

471
01:08:38,767 --> 01:08:42,806
- We need to know who's doing what.
- We are always creating!

472
01:08:43,687 --> 01:08:48,397
We move forward so fast
we stop even feeling like we're
creating something.

473
01:09:48,567 --> 01:09:53,561
Lumina, these women
are like competitive animals.

474
01:09:54,127 --> 01:09:57,164
They start by gauging each other,

475
01:09:58,967 --> 01:10:01,197
they stare at each other,
circle each other,

476
01:10:02,287 --> 01:10:04,005
they size each other up,

477
01:10:04,207 --> 01:10:10,680
to decide who's the strongest,
the most beautiful, the most competent.

478
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:15,195
then there's a seduction phase
with a touch of rivalry to it,

479
01:10:15,407 --> 01:10:20,527
which results in a kind of
battle filled with love and hate,

480
01:10:20,607 --> 01:10:22,438
and in the end the one kills the other.

481
01:10:33,047 --> 01:10:34,196
OK start.

482
01:10:41,287 --> 01:10:42,436
turn your hips up.

483
01:10:43,727 --> 01:10:46,958
Don't swing it too much,
stand more sideways.

484
01:11:09,087 --> 01:11:10,600
come forward and kick.

485
01:11:16,607 --> 01:11:21,044
Baby, back up a bit.
stay in line with the others.

486
01:11:23,887 --> 01:11:25,161
to the side.

487
01:11:54,687 --> 01:11:57,247
Lena, keep your hips up.

488
01:11:57,527 --> 01:11:59,597
don't lower your head.

489
01:12:11,647 --> 01:12:13,000
final posture.

490
01:12:15,647 --> 01:12:17,285
thanks a lot girls.

491
01:12:21,687 --> 01:12:23,120
can i hang this up?

492
01:12:30,167 --> 01:12:31,680
let's start from. . .

493
01:12:33,647 --> 01:12:34,716
is this it?

494
01:12:50,527 --> 01:12:51,516
Good!

495
01:13:05,727 --> 01:13:07,046
now to the back.

496
01:13:10,047 --> 01:13:11,036
and turn.

497
01:13:14,047 --> 01:13:16,322
OK, yeah, I know what happened.

498
01:13:17,887 --> 01:13:20,447
you told yourself to do something
which was incorrect.

499
01:13:22,367 --> 01:13:23,766
here's fine.

500
01:13:25,327 --> 01:13:27,557
when you pull to the other side. . .

501
01:13:28,447 --> 01:13:31,405
don't do a retiré,
come right over here.

502
01:13:32,047 --> 01:13:34,038
that's why you're getting behind.

503
01:13:34,807 --> 01:13:37,082
It's my fault, I didn't
explain properly.

504
01:13:38,607 --> 01:13:41,917
bring down your foot and turn.

505
01:13:44,647 --> 01:13:45,762
that's it.

506
01:13:47,047 --> 01:13:48,526
that gives you more time.

507
01:13:48,887 --> 01:13:51,447
I told you to do it with a retiré,

508
01:13:51,567 --> 01:13:54,684
but the retiré takes too long
and then you're off time.

509
01:13:55,687 --> 01:13:59,839
leg down, foot down;
that will help you turn.

510
01:14:06,927 --> 01:14:08,042
that's it.

511
01:14:09,287 --> 01:14:10,402
and now go on.

512
01:14:12,367 --> 01:14:14,642
today's trial went really well.

513
01:14:14,967 --> 01:14:18,676
OK now we're going to set up the finale!
We're going to do "Desire" !

514
01:14:19,687 --> 01:14:21,006
it's fine just like that. . .

515
01:14:23,127 --> 01:14:26,802
Now I know what was so perfect
about "Stars of Paris."

516
01:14:27,087 --> 01:14:31,603
it's because the three
rows of side lights were on.

517
01:14:31,687 --> 01:14:36,044
yeah but we have a problem there.
we have no lateral lighting.

518
01:14:36,207 --> 01:14:40,644
the conveyor belt and the letters
don't have lateral lighting on them.

519
01:14:41,527 --> 01:14:45,315
but we can get some on there
because it creates an atmosphere. . .

520
01:14:46,527 --> 01:14:50,600
yesterday there were some moments
when all the lights were on

521
01:14:50,767 --> 01:14:56,239
and we even had those strobes. . .

522
01:14:57,807 --> 01:15:01,880
aside from basic lighting,
we'll have to add those too.

523
01:15:02,487 --> 01:15:05,923
Not all the time, but there should be
a kind of progression

524
01:15:06,407 --> 01:15:08,318
so we get more and more light
on there...

525
01:15:08,447 --> 01:15:11,678
you guys are trying to do
too many things at once.

526
01:15:11,767 --> 01:15:15,919
I mean, we need the
lights in terms of aesthetics,

527
01:15:16,887 --> 01:15:19,355
and they need to be
totally tied to the music.

528
01:15:20,087 --> 01:15:24,000
What I did in "Jungle" , with Dita,

529
01:15:24,407 --> 01:15:29,925
was to try to do the lights manually,
without recording a lighting program...

530
01:15:30,327 --> 01:15:32,636
We have to record one, for tonight!

531
01:15:32,927 --> 01:15:36,363
It's been two days now that
we've been doing it manually!

532
01:15:36,607 --> 01:15:39,075
We can check them together.

533
01:15:40,767 --> 01:15:43,918
Can we get a near-naked girl
to fit inside a letter?

534
01:15:44,087 --> 01:15:45,236
Near naked?

535
01:15:46,527 --> 01:15:48,085
Just like that is fine.

536
01:15:48,447 --> 01:15:51,405
It'd be even better if the letters
were animated.

537
01:15:51,887 --> 01:15:55,800
- to be frank.
- Just like that is fantastic.

538
01:15:56,087 --> 01:15:57,964
But we can't have everything
happening at once.

539
01:16:00,367 --> 01:16:03,325
We agreed to put the animation
in with the curtain down.

540
01:16:03,687 --> 01:16:05,245
And with the animated letters.

541
01:16:05,527 --> 01:16:08,200
When the curtain goes up,
the letters remain there.

542
01:16:08,287 --> 01:16:11,040
And at that moment,
the girls are in position.

543
01:16:11,247 --> 01:16:13,920
Or we can cut off the animation
and light up their faces. . .

544
01:16:14,007 --> 01:16:16,805
If you ask me,
it's too fast.

545
01:16:16,927 --> 01:16:20,363
when the curtain goes up,
we can only see silhouettes,

546
01:16:20,447 --> 01:16:22,403
the girls are in position.

547
01:16:22,487 --> 01:16:27,720
their faces only get lit when they start
singing, because that lasts longer.

548
01:16:28,567 --> 01:16:32,799
I understand your idea about
the first image, but it doesn't work.

549
01:16:33,127 --> 01:16:35,402
we can't put any animation
on those letters.

550
01:16:35,487 --> 01:16:38,763
there's got to be an opening,
maybe with cigarette smoke,

551
01:16:38,847 --> 01:16:40,963
that would have a great impact.

552
01:17:06,047 --> 01:17:07,162
Silicone. . .

553
01:17:09,327 --> 01:17:11,158
. . . bust size.

554
01:17:14,607 --> 01:17:16,962
OK and let's see those
straps then...

555
01:17:19,087 --> 01:17:21,157
they're adjustable but
not too much.

556
01:17:28,847 --> 01:17:30,360
let's see your back.

557
01:17:36,007 --> 01:17:39,283
If the straps are too tight,

558
01:17:39,807 --> 01:17:44,801
no one can see the curvature
of your back.

559
01:17:44,967 --> 01:17:46,639
for that we need. . .

560
01:17:47,607 --> 01:17:49,962
OK i think it's fine like that.

561
01:17:53,007 --> 01:17:56,556
we have to see the fringes.
You know where they are?

562
01:17:56,647 --> 01:17:57,716
No. . .

563
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:04,566
I'll ask Roselyne for them.

564
01:18:08,807 --> 01:18:10,957
This has to be a centimeter longer.

565
01:18:13,807 --> 01:18:14,876
That's better.

566
01:18:16,167 --> 01:18:19,921
you're too close together.
try fixing it. . .

567
01:18:20,247 --> 01:18:22,807
you're taller so
we have to try to compensate.

568
01:18:23,087 --> 01:18:25,282
Try to find the right position.

569
01:18:28,327 --> 01:18:30,602
you're slightly off center.

570
01:18:31,407 --> 01:18:35,480
OK it's better if you have your
butts almost totally together,
but not your backs.

571
01:18:36,567 --> 01:18:39,764
push your body forward more.

572
01:18:40,527 --> 01:18:42,563
See?  looks like a sausage.

573
01:18:42,767 --> 01:18:45,042
- That's it.
- Right. Thanks.

574
01:18:45,647 --> 01:18:48,559
Play with your fingers.
sensual fingers.

575
01:18:52,487 --> 01:18:55,001
- You're not listening.
- Yes I am.

576
01:18:55,967 --> 01:19:00,119
Diagonally. One arm in the light
and the hand pointing towards it.

577
01:19:01,687 --> 01:19:04,247
That's it. That looks great.

578
01:19:10,087 --> 01:19:14,797
And here you lift one arm
and slowly bring down the other,

579
01:19:15,327 --> 01:19:19,115
as if you were outlining
what you're taking off. Don't. . .

580
01:19:20,847 --> 01:19:26,160
the movements need to be fluid.

581
01:19:28,927 --> 01:19:31,999
Stretch it... stretch it...
and off it comes!

582
01:19:34,767 --> 01:19:36,246
Very good, Liv.

583
01:19:36,647 --> 01:19:40,117
I was always a great
admirer of the Crazy Horse.

584
01:19:41,207 --> 01:19:43,721
It was more than admiration,
it was an obsession.

585
01:19:44,487 --> 01:19:48,241
I went to see the show like 40 times,
I was here all the time,

586
01:19:48,647 --> 01:19:50,365
I sang the songs to myself all day. . .

587
01:19:50,447 --> 01:19:53,678
And now I can't do that anymore
because I'm on the team now
so I have to be calm and focused.

588
01:19:53,767 --> 01:19:57,316
I put on music from Crazy Horse at home,
it drives my assistants nuts,

589
01:19:57,447 --> 01:20:00,484
they can't stand hearing
"You Told Me l'm a Good Girl" anymore.

590
01:20:00,887 --> 01:20:05,756
I'm really pretty obsessive. I've
gone through a number of obsessions.

591
01:20:06,527 --> 01:20:10,122
Saint-Laurent, Marlene Dietrich,
Helmut Newton, the Crazy Horse. . .

592
01:20:10,567 --> 01:20:13,001
It's one of my great obsessions.

593
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:17,799
And when I'm obsessed with something
I dedicate all my time to it.

594
01:20:18,047 --> 01:20:20,925
They're details that
Philippe doesn't care about,

595
01:20:21,047 --> 01:20:25,518
he has sort of a different
idea about femininity.

596
01:20:27,207 --> 01:20:32,486
I know that he's gone through
some tough times here,

597
01:20:32,607 --> 01:20:36,156
maybe because he's worked
here for so long,

598
01:20:36,607 --> 01:20:39,724
with a lot of people involved
and giving their opinions.

599
01:20:39,887 --> 01:20:40,876
Philippe is. . .

600
01:20:41,767 --> 01:20:46,079
he's an extremely democratic guy,
he listens to everyone's opinion.

601
01:20:47,727 --> 01:20:51,481
that's not how I am.  I only listen
to two or three people.

602
01:20:52,407 --> 01:20:57,037
Maybe I'm a bit of a dictator. . .

603
01:20:57,927 --> 01:21:00,964
you're the show's co-director?

604
01:21:01,047 --> 01:21:04,562
I'm the artistic director;
Philippe is the director.

605
01:21:04,647 --> 01:21:07,559
I'm the art director
because I came in after him

606
01:21:10,687 --> 01:21:13,565
and a lot of the numbers had
already been designed.

607
01:21:14,127 --> 01:21:15,685
the art director. . .

608
01:21:16,487 --> 01:21:20,082
deals with designing the concepts.

609
01:21:20,487 --> 01:21:25,766
there were some numbers we designed
together, others Philippe designed.

610
01:21:26,047 --> 01:21:29,403
my role involves
bringing in another perspective

611
01:21:31,447 --> 01:21:33,961
and following up on what he does.

612
01:21:34,767 --> 01:21:39,477
Philippe's the director and he's the
one that designed most of the numbers.

613
01:21:40,087 --> 01:21:45,207
I'm the art director, sure,
but those are just titles.

614
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:52,879
both of us are so involved in everything
that the roles get all mixed up.

615
01:21:55,167 --> 01:21:57,123
But it's Philippe that. . .

616
01:21:58,887 --> 01:22:00,002
is really in charge.

617
01:22:00,127 --> 01:22:03,802
and he deserves it, because
he has a ton of talent and experience

618
01:22:03,927 --> 01:22:06,999
and a legitimacy
that gives him that right.

619
01:22:11,727 --> 01:22:12,921
OK, the same thing now.

620
01:22:15,727 --> 01:22:17,683
the same thing, let's go.

621
01:22:18,847 --> 01:22:19,802
Begin.

622
01:22:21,327 --> 01:22:23,318
you moved back again.

623
01:22:28,567 --> 01:22:30,637
sing with the playback, girls.

624
01:22:36,527 --> 01:22:39,758
you're one with the chair.

625
01:22:41,407 --> 01:22:42,726
OK, now, the girlfriends. . .

626
01:22:45,087 --> 01:22:50,480
where's the other girlfriend?
we need the other one, number 6.

627
01:23:00,087 --> 01:23:03,477
you moved your hand too soon, Linda.

628
01:23:11,247 --> 01:23:12,362
the screen!

629
01:23:22,887 --> 01:23:25,401
Very good, now they need
to go on singing.

630
01:23:25,527 --> 01:23:27,802
There are two numbers that
are going to be real classics.

631
01:23:28,327 --> 01:23:29,601
It's pure "Crazy Horse."

632
01:23:29,687 --> 01:23:33,236
and at the same time,
they're totally innovative.

633
01:23:33,767 --> 01:23:35,803
you have to see it to understand.

634
01:23:37,327 --> 01:23:41,206
he really captured the
essence of the place,

635
01:23:43,127 --> 01:23:45,960
but created something totally. . .

636
01:23:47,927 --> 01:23:49,565
almost revolutionary.

637
01:23:51,407 --> 01:23:53,967
Mr. Bernardin
must be applauding in his grave

638
01:23:54,047 --> 01:23:56,561
and thinking:
"if I were there that's what I'd do."

639
01:23:57,167 --> 01:23:58,520
What number is that?

640
01:23:58,927 --> 01:24:00,519
"Rougir de Désir."
[blush with desire]

641
01:24:06,527 --> 01:24:10,202
Mr. Bernardin had a very
unique concept of eroticism.

642
01:24:10,447 --> 01:24:11,675
what's yours?

643
01:24:12,567 --> 01:24:16,958
the most important thing
is suggestiveness, seduction,

644
01:24:17,167 --> 01:24:21,445
but contained, not obscene.

645
01:24:21,767 --> 01:24:27,478
I agree with Mr. Bernardin about
how it is the fruit of frustration
and imagination.

646
01:24:28,927 --> 01:24:32,237
It's the fruit of dreams.
Dreams are very important.

647
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:37,079
It's kind of like. . .

648
01:24:40,167 --> 01:24:42,522
. . .our brand image.

649
01:24:43,327 --> 01:24:49,197
The Crazy Horse perfected
a certain kind of art,

650
01:24:52,647 --> 01:24:57,675
which consists in empowering,
celebrating and transporting

651
01:24:59,567 --> 01:25:03,719
womanhood and the seductive
and erotic game of womanhood,

652
01:25:04,207 --> 01:25:09,679
in an extremely
sophisticated, inspiring way. . .

653
01:25:10,527 --> 01:25:12,438
inspiring for women.

654
01:25:14,847 --> 01:25:17,759
not everyone agrees with me,

655
01:25:17,847 --> 01:25:19,644
but I think that Crazy Horse. . .

656
01:25:21,327 --> 01:25:23,841
well, I won't say that
women like it more,

657
01:25:24,087 --> 01:25:29,002
but it might be the only place
where you have nude dancers

658
01:25:31,527 --> 01:25:34,405
and women like to come
see the show too.

659
01:25:34,687 --> 01:25:37,565
we have a really big female
population in the audience.

660
01:25:38,287 --> 01:25:40,517
it's almost like that's the key.

661
01:25:40,607 --> 01:25:45,840
When women are comfortable with the key
to eroticism, men enjoy the benefits.

662
01:25:46,247 --> 01:25:48,761
that's my opinion.

663
01:25:49,247 --> 01:25:52,239
The key to Eroticism belongs
to womanhood.

664
01:25:52,927 --> 01:25:54,645
Well it works both ways.

665
01:25:54,767 --> 01:25:57,201
yes, it works both ways.

666
01:25:57,647 --> 01:25:58,841
exactly.

667
01:25:59,727 --> 01:26:01,957
now can we see. . .

668
01:26:02,447 --> 01:26:04,802
- a blue light instead of a red one?
- No.

669
01:26:05,087 --> 01:26:10,525
I want to see more colors
to find out if any of them look better.

670
01:26:11,927 --> 01:26:17,445
You want to switch over the colors
on the side lights to see what's best?

671
01:26:18,567 --> 01:26:20,125
that's really far too. . .

672
01:26:21,247 --> 01:26:22,646
Too red.

673
01:26:23,687 --> 01:26:26,247
you lose the red on the cords.

674
01:26:26,367 --> 01:26:28,562
- that's not bad.
- dark blue. . .

675
01:26:29,327 --> 01:26:32,558
- the Congo blue doesn't look bad.
- it's interesting, yeah.

676
01:26:33,887 --> 01:26:36,276
Let's take a look
at "Étoiles de Paris" .

677
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:46,800
This is perfect.

678
01:26:48,007 --> 01:26:49,156
one, two. . .

679
01:26:51,567 --> 01:26:52,477
that's it.

680
01:26:54,647 --> 01:26:55,602
careful. . .

681
01:26:57,927 --> 01:26:58,996
the last one. . .

682
01:27:03,087 --> 01:27:06,318
is Ali particularly interested
in costumes?

683
01:27:06,487 --> 01:27:08,955
I'm interested in everything.
costumes and everything else.

684
01:27:09,047 --> 01:27:13,598
but I'm more interested in costumes
than Philippe is.

685
01:27:14,527 --> 01:27:21,763
Philippe is a dancer,
and he sees the body as an instrument.

686
01:27:21,887 --> 01:27:26,517
Myself, I'm interested in the way
people are transfigured.

687
01:27:26,927 --> 01:27:31,682
the way a woman transforms
herself into. . .

688
01:27:33,007 --> 01:27:36,124
the fantasy vision she has of herself.

689
01:27:36,567 --> 01:27:39,843
women have the capacity,

690
01:27:41,647 --> 01:27:44,115
using what nature
gave them,

691
01:27:45,127 --> 01:27:48,005
to use artifices,
tricks and strategies

692
01:27:48,287 --> 01:27:52,166
to transform themselves
into something totally different.

693
01:27:52,207 --> 01:27:55,995
what's important isn't their basic
beauty but what we do with it.

694
01:27:56,047 --> 01:27:59,047
After 25 years of age,
a woman's beauty

695
01:27:59,047 --> 01:28:01,845
is something she needs to conquer
and build for herself.

696
01:28:03,687 --> 01:28:05,439
there are no 'ugly' women,

697
01:28:06,167 --> 01:28:10,160
only women that refuse beauty
because they deny their femininity.

698
01:28:10,367 --> 01:28:12,085
and there are lazy women.

699
01:28:12,367 --> 01:28:15,643
any woman with good attributes

700
01:28:15,727 --> 01:28:19,037
can go far beyond
the features she was born with.

701
01:28:19,527 --> 01:28:23,122
sometimes there are girls that
are very beautiful when they're young,

702
01:28:23,687 --> 01:28:25,086
but age poorly.

703
01:28:25,927 --> 01:28:28,999
they put all their trust
in the beauty they were born with

704
01:28:29,927 --> 01:28:34,239
and don't make any effort
to preserve it.

705
01:28:34,767 --> 01:28:37,884
they get obsessed with their
vision of themselves as young girls.

706
01:28:38,127 --> 01:28:40,766
On the other hand - and you can
see this clearly at the Crazy Horse. . .

707
01:28:41,167 --> 01:28:43,123
here they are all beautiful.

708
01:28:43,207 --> 01:28:48,679
But, sometimes,
the most anatomically beautiful

709
01:28:49,887 --> 01:28:52,321
are not the best looking ones
on the stage,

710
01:28:52,407 --> 01:28:56,161
because they rely too much
on the beauty they were born with,

711
01:28:56,407 --> 01:29:02,323
which makes them feel too secure
and keeps them from taking it
to the next level.

712
01:29:02,687 --> 01:29:09,206
The ones that have more complexes
develop strategies and personalities

713
01:29:09,327 --> 01:29:12,444
that help them overcome their
disadvantages.

714
01:29:12,527 --> 01:29:16,520
this makes them even more
beautiful and fascinating on stage.

715
01:29:16,607 --> 01:29:22,079
It's as if all the love in the world
were not enough for them.

716
01:31:17,807 --> 01:31:21,197
The whole city of Paris
Comes to the Crazy Horse

717
01:31:21,567 --> 01:31:24,445
The Crazy Horse is Paris

718
01:31:25,047 --> 01:31:27,686
The Sacré-Coeur

719
01:31:28,807 --> 01:31:32,516
There's a Sacré-Coeur [sacred heart]
in every Crazy Horse girl

720
01:31:32,767 --> 01:31:36,077
The Crazy Horse girls
are like Soldiers -

721
01:31:36,207 --> 01:31:39,483
Soldiers in the erotic army.

722
01:31:39,927 --> 01:31:43,237
D-E-S-I-R-E

723
01:31:43,527 --> 01:31:47,042
The Crazy Horse girls
taste like champagne

724
01:31:47,247 --> 01:31:50,717
Champagne
tastes like Crazy Horse girls

725
01:31:50,887 --> 01:31:55,722
The Champagne runs between
their fingers

726
01:31:57,727 --> 01:32:00,605
The Crazy Horse girls

727
01:32:16,687 --> 01:32:19,804
All Paris
Is at the Crazy Horse

728
01:32:20,127 --> 01:32:23,164
The Crazy Horse is Paris

729
01:32:23,927 --> 01:32:27,158
D-E-S-I-R-E

730
01:32:38,687 --> 01:32:40,803
Crazy Horse

731
01:32:44,727 --> 01:32:46,445
That was the best.

732
01:32:46,767 --> 01:32:48,519
Let's do it over once more.

733
01:34:41,527 --> 01:34:44,803
- What are you doing, Ma Nahia?
- She doesn't get it.

734
01:34:45,927 --> 01:34:47,724
Is it because you're new here?

735
01:34:51,047 --> 01:34:52,366
Are you Spanish?

736
01:34:53,927 --> 01:34:55,883
I've been working here for a whole year!

737
01:34:56,407 --> 01:35:00,366
But you're not like Nooka,
Zula or Psycho.

738
01:35:25,647 --> 01:35:27,239
Oooh, a breeze!

739
01:35:27,727 --> 01:35:28,762
It's good for you.

740
01:35:29,167 --> 01:35:31,237
still, we might catch a cold...

741
01:40:18,367 --> 01:40:19,880
Is the switch now?

742
01:40:20,407 --> 01:40:23,479
there's no switch, it's a slide.

743
01:40:25,047 --> 01:40:27,083
- But in "lnfrarouge" . . .
- there isn't one.

744
01:40:32,607 --> 01:40:34,837
I don't really like it, sorry.

745
01:40:36,407 --> 01:40:37,681
What don't you like?

746
01:40:38,287 --> 01:40:40,596
The choreography
is far too tied to the music.

747
01:40:40,807 --> 01:40:42,399
Whenever there's a pause. . .

748
01:40:44,367 --> 01:40:45,766
But, you know, it's not
so bad.

749
01:40:45,967 --> 01:40:49,277
- It's the old "Jungle" number.
- Yeah but with a girl in back.

750
01:40:50,167 --> 01:40:52,317
This one comes from "Evolution."

751
01:41:40,007 --> 01:41:42,475
It's too bad, because that
number's really. . .

752
01:41:48,807 --> 01:41:50,877
- Oh I love this part.
- It's beautiful.

753
01:41:52,647 --> 01:41:53,602
Impressive.

754
01:41:54,047 --> 01:41:56,402
The other one is stronger, I agree.

755
01:41:57,087 --> 01:42:01,160
I like the idea of doing the lighting
like they were leopards in a cage.

756
01:42:09,247 --> 01:42:11,522
- The lights are good.
- Beautiful.

757
01:42:11,647 --> 01:42:13,160
they look like panthers.

758
01:42:14,527 --> 01:42:16,882
you can't see the girl in back!

759
01:42:18,247 --> 01:42:19,646
because she's dead.

760
01:42:19,967 --> 01:42:20,922
it went out.

761
01:42:21,967 --> 01:42:24,162
we could have seen her die!

762
01:43:38,367 --> 01:43:41,439
OK I'm going to explain quickly.
do you all speak French?

763
01:43:42,567 --> 01:43:45,240
I'm going to explain how the
audition goes.

764
01:43:46,247 --> 01:43:48,556
it's simple, don't be afraid.

765
01:43:50,447 --> 01:43:51,596
it really is easy.

766
01:43:51,927 --> 01:43:54,919
you're all going to go on stage
with nothing but tiny bikini bottoms on.

767
01:43:55,007 --> 01:43:56,759
and shoes, if you want.

768
01:43:57,567 --> 01:44:00,604
You'll be on the stage,
with nice lighting,

769
01:44:00,727 --> 01:44:04,197
there'll be music, and you'll
have to improvise for one minute.

770
01:44:04,887 --> 01:44:08,675
when you're done, come off
the stage, and we'll talk.

771
01:44:09,287 --> 01:44:15,476
this audition is above all to evaluate
your proportions and your look.

772
01:44:15,607 --> 01:44:20,078
it's not for dancing skills
or acting skills.

773
01:44:20,247 --> 01:44:24,160
Anyway, we'll see whether
you know how to dance soon enough,

774
01:44:24,567 --> 01:44:28,446
but it's not worth it to
get all excited about that.

775
01:44:29,727 --> 01:44:32,480
Pretty, stylish, relaxed.

776
01:44:32,647 --> 01:44:34,956
and push your butts back.

777
01:44:37,127 --> 01:44:39,118
she fainted before the audition...

778
01:44:40,327 --> 01:44:41,885
an ambulance had to come.

779
01:44:42,247 --> 01:44:43,726
- Today?
- Yeah.

780
01:45:34,647 --> 01:45:38,481
Thanks. You can stay there on stage.
Kill the music please...

781
01:45:39,327 --> 01:45:41,045
OK can you take off your shoes?

782
01:45:46,607 --> 01:45:48,723
Stand in the middle. The sixth.

783
01:45:52,927 --> 01:45:54,485
Can you put your knees together?

784
01:46:01,127 --> 01:46:02,845
OK let's see the same
thing from the side.

785
01:46:07,087 --> 01:46:08,076
Thank you.

786
01:46:42,447 --> 01:46:45,598
Look at her size...
she has no breasts...

787
01:47:37,167 --> 01:47:38,202
That's enough.

788
01:47:38,327 --> 01:47:39,885
Thanks, Maurizio.

789
01:47:49,167 --> 01:47:50,919
We don't hire transsexuals.

790
01:47:51,047 --> 01:47:53,083
I think it's charming.

791
01:47:53,447 --> 01:47:56,678
Cyrille, open the curtain
and kill the lights.

792
01:47:57,367 --> 01:48:01,246
OK dancers all up on the stage
in a line, without shoes.

793
01:48:06,407 --> 01:48:07,726
Pretty good sample. . .

794
01:48:15,607 --> 01:48:18,599
Sorry girls, please just
stay where you are,

795
01:48:18,687 --> 01:48:20,837
we need to compare sizes.

796
01:48:21,087 --> 01:48:23,555
I know you probably feel silly. . .

797
01:48:25,847 --> 01:48:27,041
First. . .

798
01:48:27,367 --> 01:48:29,483
- Third.
- Fourth.

799
01:48:30,087 --> 01:48:32,726
I don't know, I don't know. . .
that one over there.

800
01:48:32,927 --> 01:48:35,760
The fifth, with the blue bikini bottom.

801
01:48:37,167 --> 01:48:38,202
And that one.

802
01:48:38,847 --> 01:48:40,997
tell them to step forward.

803
01:48:42,287 --> 01:48:45,484
Girls, I don't remember your names.

804
01:48:47,367 --> 01:48:51,440
Let's count from the control room side.

805
01:48:51,847 --> 01:48:52,962
That's it, right there.

806
01:48:53,487 --> 01:48:54,602
The second one.

807
01:48:55,887 --> 01:48:56,922
the fourth.

808
01:48:59,167 --> 01:49:00,282
the fifth.

809
01:49:04,247 --> 01:49:05,646
What's her name?

810
01:49:05,727 --> 01:49:08,161
Olivia. I remembered her name.

811
01:49:09,287 --> 01:49:11,482
The next one. Melissa.

812
01:49:12,687 --> 01:49:14,245
And the last one, Tatiana.

813
01:49:15,247 --> 01:49:16,362
We've got six.

814
01:49:17,967 --> 01:49:19,844
You don't want to keep the Italian?

815
01:49:20,887 --> 01:49:22,798
With the nice ass?

816
01:49:23,047 --> 01:49:24,162
Really nice.

817
01:49:27,327 --> 01:49:28,646
all the way to dance tryouts?

818
01:49:29,887 --> 01:49:32,242
the one who's always dreamed of
working at the Crazy Horse?

819
01:49:32,967 --> 01:49:34,320
I don't like her.

820
01:49:36,007 --> 01:49:37,599
- The Italian.
- That one.

821
01:49:38,647 --> 01:49:41,639
The girls in front can stay.

822
01:49:41,727 --> 01:49:44,764
The others can go to the dressing room
I'll be there in a second.

823
01:49:45,087 --> 01:49:46,361
Come closer together.

824
01:49:52,167 --> 01:49:54,806
You're tiny, Olivia,
but that's not bad.

825
01:49:58,887 --> 01:50:01,845
Tiny is cute,
it's not an insult.

826
01:50:07,087 --> 01:50:09,681
The second one looks like Kate Moss.

827
01:50:12,087 --> 01:50:12,963
It's true.

828
01:50:13,167 --> 01:50:14,805
She has short legs.

829
01:50:14,927 --> 01:50:16,042
It's not important.

830
01:50:16,087 --> 01:50:17,998
You mind turning around?

831
01:50:18,487 --> 01:50:20,159
And straighten your butts out.

832
01:50:20,407 --> 01:50:21,726
Far out.

833
01:50:24,647 --> 01:50:25,557
more.

834
01:50:27,727 --> 01:50:29,524
How many Russian girls are here?

835
01:50:29,887 --> 01:50:31,206
They're the best ones.

836
01:50:32,127 --> 01:50:34,800
Those two are the best,
don't you think?

837
01:50:34,927 --> 01:50:36,519
they have some space
between their thighs.

838
01:50:36,807 --> 01:50:38,126
That's not bad.

839
01:50:40,247 --> 01:50:42,044
Same thing from the side please.

840
01:50:43,847 --> 01:50:45,360
That one's pretty.

841
01:50:46,207 --> 01:50:48,516
Really cute, yeah; and
she's got attitude.

842
01:50:48,647 --> 01:50:51,559
Thanks, you can go back to
the dressing room.  I'll be right there.

843
01:50:56,767 --> 01:50:57,916
Not bad at all!

844
01:51:06,007 --> 01:51:10,717
It's a kind of apotheosis of beauty
in its different forms.

845
01:51:12,087 --> 01:51:16,956
For us it's a real joy to work here.

846
01:51:17,287 --> 01:51:20,484
Sometimes, when I'm trying out girls,
I have to say to myself

847
01:51:20,567 --> 01:51:25,436
"I'm not just watching a
tryout, I'm directing it"

848
01:51:26,007 --> 01:51:28,043
and I almost have to pinch myself

849
01:51:28,127 --> 01:51:34,680
to believe that I'm not dreaming and
really am involved in this spectacle
of beauty, elegance and desire.

850
01:51:34,927 --> 01:51:37,839
- Does that answer your question?
- Perfectly.

851
01:51:37,887 --> 01:51:40,879
And now tell us in English,
with the same eloquence.

852
01:54:15,167 --> 01:54:18,079
"I am going to drown in
your eyes. May I?

853
01:54:18,687 --> 01:54:21,759
"It is pure joy to drown
in your eyes.

854
01:54:22,207 --> 01:54:24,926
"I'll come and say: 'I love
you so much.'

855
01:54:25,727 --> 01:54:27,046
"May I?

856
01:54:28,967 --> 01:54:32,516
"It isn't easy to love.
It's hard.  Very hard.

857
01:54:33,050 --> 01:54:35,527
Ill come close to a steep cliff

858
01:54:35,647 --> 01:54:37,804
Will you catch me in time?

859
01:54:38,284 --> 01:54:41,319
If I go away, will you write to me?

860
01:54:41,439 --> 01:54:44,674
I cant be without you. I want to be with you.

861
01:54:44,795 --> 01:54:47,910
Not for a minute, not for a month. Forever.

862
01:54:48,071 --> 01:54:50,627
All my life, do you understand?

863
01:54:50,988 --> 01:54:53,064
Im afraid of your answer

864
01:54:53,225 --> 01:54:56,020
Answer me, but dont say a word

865
01:54:56,420 --> 01:54:58,018
Answer me with your eyes.

866
01:54:58,498 --> 01:54:59,775
Do you love me?

867
01:54:59,856 --> 01:55:01,733
If you do, I promise

868
01:55:01,854 --> 01:55:04,889
that youll happy with me forever

869
01:55:05,049 --> 01:55:07,845
If you dont, then I beg you,

870
01:55:07,966 --> 01:55:10,681
dont look at me, dont kill me

871
01:55:10,842 --> 01:55:14,077
If you want to love someone else, do it

872
01:55:14,198 --> 01:55:16,634
But remember me just a little

873
01:55:18,512 --> 01:55:21,548
Ill go on loving you. Agreed?

874
01:55:21,708 --> 01:55:24,384
Like it or not, Ill love you

875
01:55:24,545 --> 01:55:27,580
and Ill always be there for you

876
01:55:27,661 --> 01:55:30,096
whenever you need me.

877
02:01:10,703 --> 02:01:21,209
Crazy...

878
02:01:23,567 --> 02:01:25,443
Paris...

879
02:01:31,597 --> 02:01:34,592
Paris comes to the Crazy

880
02:01:34,953 --> 02:01:38,307
The Crazy is Paris

881
02:01:38,628 --> 02:01:42,063
The Eiffel Tower...

882
02:01:42,143 --> 02:01:46,057
The Eiffel Tower is all lit up
like a girl of th

883
02:01:46,338 --> 02:01:49,333
The Crazy is Paris

884
02:01:49,574 --> 02:01:52,929
Paris comes to the Crazy

885
02:01:53,289 --> 02:01:56,644
What is your name?

886
02:01:57,124 --> 02:02:00,319
D-e-s-i-r-e!

887
02:02:00,959 --> 02:02:04,434
Youll dream of the Crazy naked in your bed

888
02:02:04,515 --> 02:02:08,109
The girls of the Crazy will watch over you

889
02:02:08,230 --> 02:02:11,345
D-e-s-i-r-e!

890
02:02:11,906 --> 02:02:15,300
The girls of the Crazy taste like champagne

891
02:02:15,501 --> 02:02:18,976
Champagne tastes like the girls of the Crazy

892
02:02:19,136 --> 02:02:25,247
Champagne flows through your fingers

893
02:02:25,888 --> 02:02:29,562
The girls of the Crazy!

894
02:02:44,943 --> 02:02:48,219
Paris comes to the Crazy

895
02:02:48,339 --> 02:02:51,814
and the Crazy is Paris.

896
02:02:52,014 --> 02:02:55,409
The Sacred-Heart

897
02:02:55,570 --> 02:02:59,803
Theres a Sacred-Heart in every Crazys girl!

898
02:02:59,924 --> 02:03:03,039
You saw Crazys girls like soldiers

899
02:03:03,160 --> 02:03:06,675
They are the soldiers of wrotica army,

900
02:03:06,796 --> 02:03:10,510
D-e-s-i-r-e!

901
02:03:10,591 --> 02:03:13,945
The girls of the Crazy taste like champagne

902
02:03:14,107 --> 02:03:17,620
Champagne tastes like the girls of the Crazy

903
02:03:17,782 --> 02:03:23,972
Champagne flows through your fingers

The girls of the Crazy!
