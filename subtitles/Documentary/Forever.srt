00:00:51,122 --> 00:00:53,523
Carolyn upstairs?

3
00:00:53,525 --> 00:00:54,924
Yeah.

4
00:00:54,926 --> 00:00:56,926
She told me she feels like
she's living at the zoo

5
00:00:56,928 --> 00:00:59,429
when you do that.

6
00:00:59,431 --> 00:01:00,763
Like a bear.

7
00:01:00,765 --> 00:01:02,798
Oh, a lion.

8
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,570
Don't forget about tonight.

9
00:01:08,572 --> 00:01:12,474
No, I have an interview before,
but I will come straight home.

10
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:21,450
For the record,
that's a lion, Carolyn!

11
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,096
You caught the
seaweed in your mouth!

12
00:01:33,098 --> 00:01:35,264
Oh, we have a new champion!

13
00:01:35,266 --> 00:01:36,031
Oh!

14
00:01:36,033 --> 00:01:37,632
Oh, Mommy look!

15
00:01:37,634 --> 00:01:38,532
Did you see?

16
00:01:38,534 --> 00:01:39,967
I caught the seaweed!

17
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:41,501
We won!

18
00:01:41,503 --> 00:01:43,803
I didn't see it coming.

19
00:01:43,805 --> 00:01:47,073
She vanished, he vanished.

20
00:01:51,045 --> 00:01:54,113
He'd been seeing
a doctor downtown.

21
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:56,248
It seemed to help him.

22
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,717
He had been so depressed.

23
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,354
And then one day he was gone.

24
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:08,593
This doctor had taken
a number of patients

25
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,729
and gone to Glass Lake.

26
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:13,031
How many patients?

27
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:15,501
Uh, 10, maybe 15.

28
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:20,538
When I had just showed up, boy
they were not happy about that.

29
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:24,776
And Anthony said that
he wasn't coming back.

30
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:26,410
He said that after
Jenny's death,

31
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:30,914
he couldn't face the world
away from this place.

32
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,482
What did he mean by that?

33
00:02:36,254 --> 00:02:39,223
Did you contact the police?

34
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:41,158
They said no law
had been broken.

35
00:02:44,328 --> 00:02:46,329
I feel something
horrible will happen.

36
00:02:48,298 --> 00:02:50,499
Something horrible's
always a possibility now.

37
00:02:53,036 --> 00:02:54,703
But if you know
it's going to happen,

38
00:02:54,705 --> 00:02:56,838
shouldn't you try to stop it?

39
00:03:04,715 --> 00:03:06,682
Sorry.

40
00:03:18,893 --> 00:03:20,293
Tom?

41
00:03:20,295 --> 00:03:24,263
I know, I know, I just
got stuck in an interview.

42
00:03:24,265 --> 00:03:27,634
What are you doing?

43
00:03:27,636 --> 00:03:30,303
I know, I'll just... I'm
sorry, just two minutes,

44
00:03:30,305 --> 00:03:31,437
I'll be right back.

45
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,320
I called to say
we're not coming.

46
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,242
Why?

47
00:03:38,244 --> 00:03:39,577
Everybody knows I work late.

48
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:41,612
Come on, it'll be fun.

49
00:03:45,717 --> 00:03:46,783
Why are you being such a...

50
00:03:46,785 --> 00:03:48,017
Drop it, Alice!

51
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,954
Fucking drop it!

52
00:03:50,956 --> 00:03:51,676
Tom.

53
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,427
You know, you can be a
real asshole sometimes.

54
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:08,302
I'm going for a walk.

55
00:04:24,887 --> 00:04:29,024
Fred, hi, sorry I couldn't
get back to the office.

56
00:04:29,026 --> 00:04:30,692
No, no, I mean... her
husband left her,

57
00:04:30,694 --> 00:04:32,393
she found him at some
clinic, and she's

58
00:04:32,395 --> 00:04:34,329
convinced the place is evil.

59
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:36,898
Yeah, I don't really think
there's a story there.

60
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,299
Yeah, that's Okay.

61
00:04:38,301 --> 00:04:39,801
Yeah, see you tomorrow.

62
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:00,441
Tom?

63
00:05:04,691 --> 00:05:06,024
Tom, I'm back.

64
00:05:06,026 --> 00:05:06,991
You hungry?

65
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,030
Game four

66
00:05:13,032 --> 00:05:14,564
of the American
League championship

67
00:05:14,566 --> 00:05:18,101
series... is there a fight
left in the New York Yankees?

68
00:05:18,103 --> 00:05:20,403
The setbacks...

69
00:05:20,405 --> 00:05:21,126
Tom?

70
00:05:41,961 --> 00:05:44,128
Tom?

71
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:44,750
I'm sorry! I'm... I'm sorry!

72
00:07:55,869 --> 00:07:58,070
Sure, get ahead of you.

73
00:08:03,076 --> 00:08:04,109
Luke, you all right?

74
00:08:04,111 --> 00:08:06,711
You on the wagon, or something?

75
00:08:06,713 --> 00:08:11,049
You look kinda sad,
just sitting there.

76
00:08:11,051 --> 00:08:12,011
Want to spark it?

77
00:08:15,088 --> 00:08:17,456
Be right back.

78
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:18,490
Do you want to spark it?

79
00:08:18,492 --> 00:08:20,391
What kind of question is that?

80
00:08:20,393 --> 00:08:22,994
What kind of question is that?

81
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,735
No, no, no... we'll take
a cab, we'll take a cab.

82
00:09:00,737 --> 00:09:02,369
We'll pick up the
car in the morning.

83
00:09:02,371 --> 00:09:06,340
It's not a big deal,
it's not a big...

84
00:09:08,945 --> 00:09:10,978
Zak, look at me!

85
00:09:36,905 --> 00:09:37,938
You OK?

86
00:09:59,897 --> 00:10:01,063
What the fuck?

87
00:10:20,383 --> 00:10:21,185
My baby?

88
00:10:23,753 --> 00:10:25,954
I want to see my baby.

89
00:10:25,956 --> 00:10:27,690
I want to see Tasha.

90
00:10:27,692 --> 00:10:28,691
Don't budge, don't move.

91
00:10:28,693 --> 00:10:31,827
We're gonna get you out.

92
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:35,565
Everything's going
to be all right.

93
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:38,601
Fucking shit, fucking waste
of fucking.

94
00:10:41,504 --> 00:10:43,338
Fuck you, fucking
shit, fucking cunt!

95
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,775
You fuckin' hole, you fuckin'
hole, fuck you in your hole!

96
00:10:46,777 --> 00:10:48,543
Fuck you in your fucking eye!

97
00:10:48,545 --> 00:10:50,479
Fuck you, you fuck!

98
00:10:50,481 --> 00:10:51,112
Gordon!

99
00:10:51,114 --> 00:10:52,813
Fuck!

100
00:10:52,815 --> 00:10:55,382
Fuckin' son of a bitch!

101
00:10:55,384 --> 00:10:56,349
Fuck you!

102
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,389
Is that Wayne?

103
00:11:03,391 --> 00:11:04,189
That's Wayne!

104
00:11:04,191 --> 00:11:05,156
Wayne!

105
00:11:05,158 --> 00:11:06,824
Wayne, hey!

106
00:11:06,826 --> 00:11:08,626
We were just talking about you.

107
00:11:08,628 --> 00:11:10,427
I can believe it.

108
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:12,662
You Okay?

109
00:11:12,664 --> 00:11:16,199
Oh, you're not pissed
about New Year's?

110
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:17,466
You're pissed.

111
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,700
Come on, honey.

112
00:11:18,702 --> 00:11:21,904
No, he's pissed.

113
00:11:21,906 --> 00:11:24,840
I don't know who you are.

114
00:11:24,842 --> 00:11:28,844
I should know, but I don't.

115
00:11:28,846 --> 00:11:31,546
I'm James, and this is Sheila.

116
00:11:31,548 --> 00:11:32,681
Oh yeah, yeah.

117
00:11:38,487 --> 00:11:41,155
I don't know where I am.

118
00:11:41,157 --> 00:11:44,158
Where am I?

119
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,294
Let's... why don't
you come with us?

120
00:11:46,296 --> 00:11:47,336
Let's take you home.

121
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,366
Come on, come on!

122
00:11:53,368 --> 00:11:54,133
Hey!

123
00:11:54,135 --> 00:11:54,816
Okay!

124
00:12:31,941 --> 00:12:33,341
Ah!

125
00:12:33,343 --> 00:12:34,909
Ah!

126
00:12:34,911 --> 00:12:36,911
No!

127
00:12:36,913 --> 00:12:38,880
Jenny!

128
00:12:38,882 --> 00:12:39,881
Help!

129
00:12:39,883 --> 00:12:41,282
Help!

130
00:12:41,284 --> 00:12:43,250
Help!

131
00:12:47,221 --> 00:12:49,589
What is it?

132
00:13:26,563 --> 00:13:32,334
When I had just showed up,
they were not happy about that.

133
00:13:32,336 --> 00:13:35,503
And, uh, Anthony said that
he wasn't coming back.

134
00:13:35,505 --> 00:13:37,438
He said that after
Jenny's death,

135
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,443
he couldn't face the world
away from this place.

136
00:13:42,445 --> 00:13:48,015
When I showed just showed up,
they were not happy about that.

137
00:13:48,017 --> 00:13:51,085
And Anthony said that
he wasn't coming back.

138
00:13:51,087 --> 00:13:52,486
He said that after
Jenny's death,

139
00:13:52,488 --> 00:13:54,855
he couldn't face the world
away from this place.

140
00:13:58,026 --> 00:13:59,259
Where?

141
00:13:59,261 --> 00:14:01,027
Uh, near Glass Lake.

142
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:03,563
But you don't know what
kind of clinic it is?

143
00:14:03,565 --> 00:14:05,731
Hmm, find out.

144
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:08,501
There's no story there,
you said that yourself.

145
00:14:08,503 --> 00:14:09,624
Well, maybe I was wrong.

146
00:14:14,072 --> 00:14:17,442
We're not going to pay for it.

147
00:14:17,444 --> 00:14:18,509
Fred...

148
00:14:18,511 --> 00:14:20,392
You need to take time to grieve.

149
00:14:23,015 --> 00:14:26,685
Well, what do you
know about grief?

150
00:14:26,687 --> 00:14:28,520
I'm sorry.

151
00:14:28,522 --> 00:14:30,588
This is bull shit.

152
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,350
Alice...

153
00:16:31,527 --> 00:16:32,449
May I help you?

154
00:16:36,465 --> 00:16:40,068
What are you doing here?

155
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,569
Um, I was walking by the tracks.

156
00:16:41,571 --> 00:16:44,606
I saw your chimney.

157
00:16:44,608 --> 00:16:45,648
Where are you going?

158
00:16:52,248 --> 00:16:53,128
Who are you?

159
00:16:58,487 --> 00:16:59,487
I don't know.

160
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,192
Well you should keep on going.

161
00:17:05,194 --> 00:17:06,493
You don't want to be here.

162
00:17:10,665 --> 00:17:14,568
And be careful on the
tracks... walk off to one side.

163
00:18:25,784 --> 00:18:27,852
Hey, babies.

164
00:18:27,854 --> 00:18:31,856
Hey... good babies.

165
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,750
Charlie!

166
00:18:58,752 --> 00:19:00,384
Charlie, get back here!

167
00:19:03,055 --> 00:19:03,821
Charlie!

168
00:19:03,823 --> 00:19:04,744
Jesus, Charlie!

169
00:19:31,052 --> 00:19:32,219
You're not Charlie.

170
00:19:35,989 --> 00:19:37,322
And you're Betsy.

171
00:19:40,093 --> 00:19:42,226
Tell me you're Betsy,
for Christ's sake.

172
00:19:44,897 --> 00:19:45,763
I'm Betsy.

173
00:19:45,765 --> 00:19:47,331
Put your bags down.

174
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:03,682
What are we doing?

175
00:20:03,684 --> 00:20:04,404
Here.

176
00:20:09,287 --> 00:20:11,921
The boy was good at this.

177
00:20:11,923 --> 00:20:12,724
Charlie?

178
00:20:15,659 --> 00:20:16,825
I can show you a trick.

179
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:29,904
Here, it's like the
shoulders of a jacket.

180
00:20:29,906 --> 00:20:30,626
See?

181
00:20:41,483 --> 00:20:42,282
What?

182
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:44,652
I don't know.

183
00:20:44,654 --> 00:20:49,289
Oh, Wayne... who
the fuck are you?

184
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:53,860
Who is this, Wayne?

185
00:20:53,862 --> 00:20:54,622
Betsy.

186
00:21:01,234 --> 00:21:04,203
She came over the tracks.

187
00:21:04,205 --> 00:21:05,045
From where?

188
00:21:08,542 --> 00:21:10,976
So what did you guys talk about?

189
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,211
I told her to go away.

190
00:21:13,213 --> 00:21:16,114
That was good advice.

191
00:21:16,116 --> 00:21:17,548
Why didn't you follow it?

192
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,049
How did she get past the dogs?

193
00:21:19,051 --> 00:21:21,719
Nobody gets past the dogs.

194
00:21:21,721 --> 00:21:22,720
You see the dogs?

195
00:21:26,992 --> 00:21:28,826
You always travel with no ID?

196
00:21:32,464 --> 00:21:33,931
You know what an ID is?

197
00:21:37,068 --> 00:21:39,436
Yeah, well, where's yours?

198
00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:43,559
That's not a
rhetorical question.

199
00:21:47,811 --> 00:21:51,281
Why are you so mean?

200
00:21:51,283 --> 00:21:53,483
I don't know who I am.

201
00:21:53,485 --> 00:21:56,153
I don't know how I got here,
and I don't know who you are,

202
00:21:56,155 --> 00:21:58,195
but I wish you'd stop
being such a shit.

203
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,431
Okay.

204
00:22:08,433 --> 00:22:16,434
We'll feed her, give her $50,
and drop her at the station.

205
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,207
I want to stay.

206
00:22:18,209 --> 00:22:19,174
Why?

207
00:22:19,176 --> 00:22:20,910
Do you like being abused?

208
00:22:20,912 --> 00:22:22,444
I can do laundry.

209
00:22:22,446 --> 00:22:23,978
Come on, it's pathetic.

210
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,415
We could call the police,
hand her over to them.

211
00:22:27,417 --> 00:22:32,520
That's just what we
need, Tony... fucking cops.

212
00:22:32,522 --> 00:22:35,990
So who's going to take
her to the station?

213
00:22:35,992 --> 00:22:37,458
No, no, no, please no.

214
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,327
I just want to stay
here with you, please!

215
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:40,861
Please, I just want
to stay here with you.

216
00:22:40,863 --> 00:22:42,762
I can't go back to...
you have to let me stay.

217
00:22:42,764 --> 00:22:44,531
I can't go back
out there... please,

218
00:22:44,533 --> 00:22:47,600
you have to just... I
just want to stay here with you,

219
00:22:47,602 --> 00:22:52,439
Please, I just want to be
here. Anything but that.

220
00:22:52,441 --> 00:22:54,607
Please just let me stay
here with you guys.

221
00:22:54,609 --> 00:22:59,812
I just... please, please,
I don't know what...

222
00:22:59,814 --> 00:23:01,580
Sshh, it's Okay.

223
00:23:01,582 --> 00:23:07,453
Here, here, here, here, here.

224
00:23:07,455 --> 00:23:11,357
Take it easy, take it easy, Okay?

225
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:13,258
Now drink it.

226
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,495
You'll feel better.

227
00:23:16,497 --> 00:23:17,178
Okay.

228
00:23:33,947 --> 00:23:36,181
I want to
see elbows and assholes!

229
00:23:36,183 --> 00:23:38,217
Elbows and assholes!

230
00:23:38,219 --> 00:23:40,185
Everybody up!

231
00:23:40,187 --> 00:23:42,420
I want to see
elbows and assholes!

232
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:56,901
Here you go, darlin'.

233
00:23:56,903 --> 00:24:00,204
Neal wants to see you before
he goes to the market.

234
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:01,973
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

235
00:24:29,402 --> 00:24:31,482
Comforters, they're
making the comforters.

236
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:40,345
I spoke with the
folks here about you

237
00:24:40,347 --> 00:24:44,582
staying with us,
for now that is,

238
00:24:44,584 --> 00:24:49,086
and I think they'll
be okay with it.

239
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:50,121
Thank you.

240
00:24:50,123 --> 00:24:53,057
Don't thank me, yet.

241
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:56,895
You know, it's been said
that our humanity lies

242
00:24:56,897 --> 00:25:02,200
in what we've done, and
what we've experienced.

243
00:25:02,202 --> 00:25:04,082
Have you ever
thought about that?

244
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:09,640
If you believe
that... I do... then

245
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:11,408
it might go without
saying that if you

246
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,410
strip a person of
their experience,

247
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:15,045
they become destructive.

248
00:25:18,249 --> 00:25:22,186
So you need to remember yours.

249
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:29,660
The people here are in the
last stages of their recovery,

250
00:25:29,662 --> 00:25:34,799
and they know very well from
what they're recovering.

251
00:25:34,801 --> 00:25:38,303
So you're going to have
to remember something

252
00:25:38,305 --> 00:25:39,904
about what happened
to you, or I'm

253
00:25:39,906 --> 00:25:47,907
wildly irresponsible for letting
you stay... for both our sakes.

254
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:54,885
That's Charlie.

255
00:25:58,556 --> 00:25:59,477
You understand?

256
00:26:04,795 --> 00:26:08,865
So... Okay.

257
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,433
All right, then.

258
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:16,739
So we'll get you back
and you can meet people.

259
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:20,810
And then you can work
the kitchen tonight.

260
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:27,683
Charlie, this is the young woman
that showed up last evening.

261
00:26:27,685 --> 00:26:30,352
She doesn't remember her name.

262
00:26:30,354 --> 00:26:31,394
And this is Charlie.

263
00:26:36,425 --> 00:26:40,295
Charlie, would you... why
don't you bring her back

264
00:26:40,297 --> 00:26:41,297
and introduce her?

265
00:26:46,069 --> 00:26:46,789
Good.

266
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,686
Why don't you just go
back the way you came.

267
00:27:09,724 --> 00:27:14,295
You can do that,
don't you think Alice?

268
00:27:26,141 --> 00:27:29,176
Do you want to quilt
sewn by one of those.

269
00:27:29,178 --> 00:27:30,977
God, no.

270
00:27:30,979 --> 00:27:33,714
Do you want me to be
sewing your clothes?

271
00:27:33,716 --> 00:27:36,583
Honey, you can sew
my quilt anytime.

272
00:27:36,585 --> 00:27:38,285
Does anyone have
left-handed scissors?

273
00:27:38,287 --> 00:27:39,486
Honey, we don't.

274
00:27:39,488 --> 00:27:40,520
You struggling?

275
00:27:40,522 --> 00:27:42,288
Oh, honey, I'm sorry I don't.

276
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:43,990
Oh, Julie.

277
00:27:43,992 --> 00:27:48,760
Have you noticed that not one
man has volunteered to do this.

278
00:27:48,762 --> 00:27:51,563
Would you want them to?

279
00:27:51,565 --> 00:27:53,665
Could you imagine Neal?

280
00:27:56,502 --> 00:27:58,135
We have a new helper here.

281
00:27:58,137 --> 00:27:59,402
Oh, I know who you are.

282
00:27:59,404 --> 00:28:01,337
Come on over here, honey.

283
00:28:01,339 --> 00:28:04,174
We can use all the
help we can get.

284
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:10,980
I thought there were
no more newcomers.

285
00:28:10,982 --> 00:28:14,084
I wasn't just talking about her.

286
00:28:14,086 --> 00:28:20,424
Now, this is Anthony's, and
you can just cut strips out

287
00:28:20,426 --> 00:28:21,558
of this old sheet.

288
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,092
I mean, it's easy.

289
00:28:23,094 --> 00:28:27,530
I mean, I know she might
not know who she is,

290
00:28:27,532 --> 00:28:29,164
but can you talk?

291
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,331
Jesus, Julie.

292
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,200
Give her a break.

293
00:28:32,202 --> 00:28:34,168
I can talk.

294
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:38,239
Oh, I'm know how to use words,
but you don't know who you are.

295
00:28:38,241 --> 00:28:39,773
Julie, you don't know anything.

296
00:28:39,775 --> 00:28:44,244
I know one thing... this sucks.

297
00:28:44,246 --> 00:28:48,280
Wait a minute... wait a minute!

298
00:28:49,449 --> 00:28:51,516
Oh, you're kidding.

299
00:28:51,518 --> 00:28:53,751
I can feel it coming.

300
00:28:53,753 --> 00:28:55,119
Hillary, no...

301
00:29:05,696 --> 00:29:07,096
Julie's sulking.

302
00:29:07,098 --> 00:29:09,099
Go to hell.

303
00:29:09,101 --> 00:29:11,067
Oh, Jules.

304
00:29:20,845 --> 00:29:23,379
Come on, young
lady... give it a try.

305
00:29:23,381 --> 00:29:26,349
Come on... you can do it.

306
00:29:30,354 --> 00:29:31,987
She's a keeper!

307
00:29:55,681 --> 00:29:56,947
Now, who's this?

308
00:29:59,784 --> 00:30:01,250
It's a mystery, Wayne.

309
00:30:04,121 --> 00:30:06,755
No, it's Betsy.

310
00:30:06,757 --> 00:30:08,324
Huh... isn't it?

311
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:13,529
Luke here was just telling
us about the first time

312
00:30:13,531 --> 00:30:16,198
he was kissed.

313
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,669
Watching a basketball
game, it's just so romantic.

314
00:30:20,671 --> 00:30:22,370
No, man... we
fucking took a vote.

315
00:30:22,372 --> 00:30:23,704
We said no more.

316
00:30:23,706 --> 00:30:25,640
You said that was it...
she can't fucking stay!

317
00:30:25,642 --> 00:30:27,041
All right, sit down, Charlie!

318
00:30:27,043 --> 00:30:28,575
You said that was fucking it!

319
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:29,442
Fuck that!

320
00:30:29,444 --> 00:30:30,142
Cool down, Charlie.

321
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:33,379
Fuck you!

322
00:30:33,381 --> 00:30:34,341
Sit down, Gordon.

323
00:30:37,684 --> 00:30:38,884
Cool down, asshole.

324
00:30:38,886 --> 00:30:40,285
You guys... sit down, Gordon!

325
00:30:44,757 --> 00:30:46,090
He's right, though, Neil.

326
00:30:46,092 --> 00:30:48,125
Charlie's crazy, but
he's right so this one.

327
00:30:48,127 --> 00:30:49,927
We don't know
anything about her.

328
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:51,228
Let's don't talk about this now.

329
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:53,530
We just don't have
the time or the energy

330
00:30:53,532 --> 00:30:56,333
to go through the process that
we've all been going through.

331
00:30:56,335 --> 00:30:58,702
Please, not now.

332
00:30:58,704 --> 00:31:01,404
Okay, if you just... please.

333
00:31:01,406 --> 00:31:02,506
I agree.

334
00:31:02,508 --> 00:31:05,308
What happened?

335
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,744
It's Gordon and Charlie.

336
00:31:07,746 --> 00:31:09,846
Like brothers.

337
00:31:09,848 --> 00:31:12,682
I had all brothers.

338
00:31:12,684 --> 00:31:15,686
They'd bring their
friends home from school,

339
00:31:15,688 --> 00:31:20,157
and they'd go to
all of my underwear.

340
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,125
I did that once.

341
00:31:22,127 --> 00:31:28,265
Not yours... not your underwear,
but a sister of a friend.

342
00:31:28,267 --> 00:31:31,869
They have this laundry chute
with these two little doors...

343
00:31:31,871 --> 00:31:34,404
one from the bedroom,
one from the bathroom.

344
00:31:34,406 --> 00:31:37,407
If you kept them both
open, you could spy

345
00:31:37,409 --> 00:31:40,511
on Jack's sister taking a bath.

346
00:31:40,513 --> 00:31:43,247
We got into so much trouble.

347
00:31:43,249 --> 00:31:44,215
Oh!

348
00:31:44,217 --> 00:31:46,150
Son of a bitch!

349
00:31:53,326 --> 00:31:54,758
Now, you sit down.

350
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,727
Holy fuck!

351
00:31:58,330 --> 00:31:59,729
Charlie, fuck!

352
00:31:59,731 --> 00:32:02,299
Charlie, fuck!

353
00:32:02,301 --> 00:32:03,700
Get away from me!

354
00:32:03,702 --> 00:32:04,834
Get the fuck back!

355
00:32:04,836 --> 00:32:06,635
Blow the stupid
whistle, Charlie!

356
00:32:06,637 --> 00:32:07,670
Blow the fucking whistle!

357
00:32:07,672 --> 00:32:09,672
Blow the whistle Charlie!

358
00:32:09,674 --> 00:32:12,675
Blow the fucking
whistle, Charlie!

359
00:32:13,879 --> 00:32:15,879
Thank you, mother
fucker, thank you!

360
00:32:49,883 --> 00:32:53,085
Do you mind finishing up here?

361
00:32:53,087 --> 00:32:56,889
We're almost done, so...

362
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,523
It's no problem.

363
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:10,310
I'm sorry.

364
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:17,142
It's Okay, I'll finish up.

365
00:33:37,565 --> 00:33:38,525
You want coffee?

366
00:33:41,968 --> 00:33:44,503
Yeah, I'd love some.

367
00:33:44,505 --> 00:33:45,704
How do you take it?

368
00:33:45,706 --> 00:33:47,138
Just black.

369
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:50,609
Black like my heart.

370
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:51,771
Give that a rinse, please.

371
00:33:54,345 --> 00:33:56,013
There you go.

372
00:33:56,015 --> 00:33:57,113
I'll be back.

373
00:34:29,217 --> 00:34:31,084
You have something
you want to say to me?

374
00:34:31,086 --> 00:34:33,787
You believe in cause and effect?

375
00:34:33,789 --> 00:34:35,855
It's like when something
happens and then

376
00:34:35,857 --> 00:34:37,524
that's just...
that's just who you

377
00:34:37,526 --> 00:34:39,158
are for the rest of
your shitty life.

378
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,960
Do you believe in that?

379
00:34:41,962 --> 00:34:43,929
You're a fucking cunt, Alice.

380
00:34:43,931 --> 00:34:45,664
These are decent
people, and they're not

381
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:46,965
messing with anybody.

382
00:34:46,967 --> 00:34:48,700
And you're not going
to mess it up for them.

383
00:34:48,702 --> 00:34:49,601
No, that is not true.

384
00:34:49,603 --> 00:34:50,735
I like everyone here.

385
00:34:50,737 --> 00:34:51,602
Oh yeah, you like
everybody here?

386
00:34:51,604 --> 00:34:52,869
Yes.

387
00:34:52,871 --> 00:34:54,070
Yeah, fucking Luke
stabbed his best friend,

388
00:34:54,072 --> 00:34:56,973
you fucking like him?

389
00:34:56,975 --> 00:34:58,541
I like you.

390
00:34:58,543 --> 00:35:00,976
You don't know what
you're talking about.

391
00:35:00,978 --> 00:35:03,612
You're wrong.

392
00:35:03,614 --> 00:35:04,415
You are...

393
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:11,520
Oh, fuck.

394
00:35:11,522 --> 00:35:12,554
Oh, man.

395
00:35:23,266 --> 00:35:26,502
Not here... no, not here.

396
00:36:52,429 --> 00:36:58,000
Hey, cinnamon
girl... where are you?

397
00:36:58,002 --> 00:37:01,604
It's just Gordon.

398
00:37:16,954 --> 00:37:19,923
I'll go out...
I'll go out first.

399
00:37:19,925 --> 00:37:20,606
Okay?

400
00:37:23,059 --> 00:37:23,939
Hey, Alice...

401
00:37:33,637 --> 00:37:34,670
Thank you.

402
00:38:01,868 --> 00:38:03,368
Sorry, I let myself in.

403
00:38:08,574 --> 00:38:11,709
It's all right.

404
00:38:11,711 --> 00:38:12,876
Will you sit?

405
00:38:29,863 --> 00:38:37,865
Listen to me... when they ask
you if you remember anything,

406
00:38:38,307 --> 00:38:41,074
do not say a word.

407
00:38:41,076 --> 00:38:42,308
Do you understand?

408
00:38:53,387 --> 00:38:56,857
I- I'm going to die here.

409
00:38:56,859 --> 00:39:00,460
But it doesn't matter, because
I'm going to die anyway.

410
00:39:00,462 --> 00:39:05,365
I'm sick, I'm very sick.

411
00:39:05,367 --> 00:39:08,902
But you're not.

412
00:39:08,904 --> 00:39:14,875
All these people... they're
all going to kill themselves.

413
00:39:17,979 --> 00:39:19,647
And you want to do that?

414
00:39:22,183 --> 00:39:23,016
Do you?

415
00:39:29,823 --> 00:39:33,827
Trust me, you don't.

416
00:40:04,563 --> 00:40:07,966
What's going on here?

417
00:40:07,968 --> 00:40:10,735
We're building beds.

418
00:40:10,737 --> 00:40:14,306
They're a little
small, aren't they?

419
00:40:14,308 --> 00:40:15,940
Then they're just right.

420
00:40:15,942 --> 00:40:17,942
You want to try one?

421
00:40:17,944 --> 00:40:19,311
No, it's Okay.

422
00:40:19,313 --> 00:40:23,814
Here, come.

423
00:40:23,816 --> 00:40:24,497
Okay.

424
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:34,318
They're not soft.

425
00:40:36,527 --> 00:40:38,795
It's going to be
nice though, right?

426
00:40:45,469 --> 00:40:47,069
Here, put these on.

427
00:40:58,316 --> 00:40:59,449
Now sing.

428
00:41:03,587 --> 00:41:06,221
Just sing along with the song.

429
00:41:06,223 --> 00:41:07,923
Oh, no, I can't sing.

430
00:41:07,925 --> 00:41:10,091
I don't even know the song.

431
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:13,028
Trust me, it feels good.

432
00:42:09,259 --> 00:42:12,828
It's good practice.

433
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,832
Helps you focus.

434
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:17,200
Sure.

435
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:20,470
But for what?

436
00:42:20,472 --> 00:42:21,804
To let go.

437
00:42:25,408 --> 00:42:26,241
Of what?

438
00:42:30,579 --> 00:42:33,748
Can I have those back?

439
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:34,510
Sorry.

440
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:56,352
Why haven't you
told anyone else?

441
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:01,878
You know who I am.

442
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,247
I figured you'd
do that yourself.

443
00:43:56,171 --> 00:43:58,505
Charlie, what are you doing?

444
00:43:58,507 --> 00:44:01,842
He just drank out of the.

445
00:44:01,844 --> 00:44:04,411
That's nasty..

446
00:44:04,413 --> 00:44:05,779
Good morning.

447
00:44:29,141 --> 00:44:33,110
I got it!

448
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,015
That's a penalty!

449
00:44:38,017 --> 00:44:39,583
Kick it in!

450
00:44:39,585 --> 00:44:40,216
Shoot!

451
00:44:40,218 --> 00:44:41,283
Shoot!

452
00:44:41,285 --> 00:44:43,119
Nice and easy!

453
00:44:44,489 --> 00:44:46,088
I got it, hon.

454
00:44:49,393 --> 00:44:52,328
Oh, Charlie, learn
to walk, buddy!

455
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:53,295
You see that?

456
00:44:53,297 --> 00:44:55,464
Everybody see that?

457
00:45:03,272 --> 00:45:05,840
Pick 'em up.

458
00:45:09,378 --> 00:45:11,345
Shoot!

459
00:45:23,192 --> 00:45:24,158
She's a keeper.

460
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,426
She is a keeper.

461
00:45:25,428 --> 00:45:26,293
We won, Charlie.

462
00:45:26,295 --> 00:45:27,394
I'm sorry, you suck.

463
00:45:30,531 --> 00:45:32,266
I think we've got a
ringer there, Neil.

464
00:45:32,268 --> 00:45:33,148
Well played.

465
00:45:36,471 --> 00:45:37,138
You played.

466
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,406
I guess.

467
00:45:39,408 --> 00:45:41,341
You played.

468
00:45:41,343 --> 00:45:43,877
All right,
let's get ready for dinner.

469
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,763
Wayne, did you forgot about me?

470
00:46:03,765 --> 00:46:06,165
Do you remember
my request, Wayne?

471
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:09,902
Gordon?

472
00:46:09,904 --> 00:46:12,371
Could you get everyone's
attention for me, please?

473
00:46:12,373 --> 00:46:13,539
I have something
I'd like to say.

474
00:46:13,541 --> 00:46:14,706
Right now?

475
00:46:14,708 --> 00:46:16,240
Uh, please.

476
00:46:16,242 --> 00:46:17,641
Absolutely.

477
00:46:17,643 --> 00:46:19,810
Everybody listen up, listen up.

478
00:46:19,812 --> 00:46:23,713
My sister here of the
great leg has something

479
00:46:23,715 --> 00:46:25,048
she would like to say.

480
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:26,382
Just for the record, I
taught her everything

481
00:46:26,384 --> 00:46:28,183
she knows... you better
fucking believe that.

482
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:30,485
Why don't you just get
a, Gordon?

483
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:34,188
Eat a fat dick, sir.

484
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:35,455
Here she goes.

485
00:46:39,494 --> 00:46:41,328
Thank you.

486
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:48,335
Uh, I just wanted to say
I remembered my name.

487
00:46:48,337 --> 00:46:49,870
My name is Alice.

488
00:46:55,009 --> 00:46:57,276
Actually, I've
known it all along.

489
00:46:57,278 --> 00:47:01,914
I was pretending not to,
but I'm ashamed of that

490
00:47:01,916 --> 00:47:05,484
because I think all of
you deserve much better.

491
00:47:10,056 --> 00:47:16,595
Partly, though I don't
know what Alice means.

492
00:47:16,597 --> 00:47:18,029
I don't really know who I am.

493
00:47:18,031 --> 00:47:23,168
I... I feel things since Tom
died, but I don't really

494
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:25,804
know them.

495
00:47:25,806 --> 00:47:27,806
I don't know if that
makes any sense.

496
00:47:31,444 --> 00:47:36,046
Almost all the time when I'm
by myself I think about Tom...

497
00:47:36,048 --> 00:47:39,916
crammed in that tub, he was
really just too big for it.

498
00:47:39,918 --> 00:47:43,686
And um, in his suit.

499
00:47:43,688 --> 00:47:46,555
He had the one suit.

500
00:47:46,557 --> 00:47:48,477
Called himself the
last gentleman.

501
00:47:50,893 --> 00:47:54,295
And the mess, oh, the mess.

502
00:47:54,297 --> 00:47:56,965
And that gun... I didn't
even know he had it.

503
00:47:56,967 --> 00:48:01,236
Um, I didn't even he was...

504
00:48:01,238 --> 00:48:05,573
Anyways, I keep wondering if
I'd done something differently,

505
00:48:05,575 --> 00:48:09,710
if I hadn't walked out
that night after we fought,

506
00:48:09,712 --> 00:48:11,278
maybe something
would be different.

507
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,681
But I don't know.

508
00:48:13,683 --> 00:48:14,443
Maybe.

509
00:48:18,285 --> 00:48:21,521
Who is Tom?

510
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:22,563
Tom was my boyfriend.

511
00:48:25,726 --> 00:48:29,462
I was interviewing
your wife that night.

512
00:48:29,464 --> 00:48:30,597
It's, um, why we fought.

513
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:32,231
I was late coming home.

514
00:48:40,741 --> 00:48:42,709
I'm a journalist.

515
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:44,377
Oh, dear god.

516
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:46,612
I lied to myself
that I was coming here

517
00:48:46,614 --> 00:48:49,716
to investigate a story.

518
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,284
I'm not here for that story.

519
00:48:55,523 --> 00:49:00,293
Please, I would... I would
very much like to stay.

520
00:49:14,844 --> 00:49:18,647
Alice... Alice, that's right?

521
00:49:18,649 --> 00:49:20,348
Yes, I'm Alice.

522
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:25,386
You know what we're
doing here, right?

523
00:49:30,659 --> 00:49:32,226
Do you agree with us?

524
00:49:37,365 --> 00:49:40,066
Uh, yes.

525
00:49:40,068 --> 00:49:41,948
Because most of
humanity doesn't.

526
00:49:45,372 --> 00:49:49,442
People are disappointed,
horrible things happen.

527
00:49:52,212 --> 00:49:57,983
And they move on, and go
on living all the time.

528
00:49:57,985 --> 00:50:04,523
And they'd find us diminishing
and absurd, fraudulent.

529
00:50:04,525 --> 00:50:06,626
And it's Okay to feel that way.

530
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:07,727
It's Okay.

531
00:50:07,729 --> 00:50:08,728
You understand?

532
00:50:15,836 --> 00:50:19,105
So do you still
want to stay here?

533
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:35,255
Yeah, I do.

534
00:50:41,362 --> 00:50:48,268
OK, so you should take
your dinner with you,

535
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:50,738
and I'll come and find
you when we're done.

536
00:51:19,538 --> 00:51:20,258
Why?

537
00:51:25,109 --> 00:51:29,078
I like it here.

538
00:51:47,298 --> 00:51:50,801
Well, the folks here have
voted for you to stay.

539
00:51:53,938 --> 00:51:56,240
We're all out of our
minds, of course,

540
00:51:56,242 --> 00:51:57,708
but you already knew that.

541
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:04,948
Thank you.

542
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:06,149
Why not?

543
00:52:19,098 --> 00:52:20,832
Don't let her stay, Neil.

544
00:52:20,834 --> 00:52:22,500
It's not right!

545
00:52:22,502 --> 00:52:23,667
It's her decision.

546
00:52:23,669 --> 00:52:25,069
You should know better.

547
00:52:25,071 --> 00:52:27,938
Have you seen the way
she looks at Charlie?

548
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:30,708
Seems to me she's
made up her mind.

549
00:53:46,062 --> 00:53:48,597
What kind of things?

550
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:51,900
When I'm having a
good day, like today,

551
00:53:51,902 --> 00:53:55,371
I remember a lot about my wife.

552
00:53:55,373 --> 00:53:56,905
She was pretty, my wife.

553
00:53:56,907 --> 00:54:00,074
You know, like you.

554
00:54:00,076 --> 00:54:01,676
Is she still?

555
00:54:05,013 --> 00:54:07,615
Do you have kids?

556
00:54:07,617 --> 00:54:09,883
I have photos.

557
00:54:09,885 --> 00:54:12,853
Ah, Jesus Christ... stop it!

558
00:54:12,855 --> 00:54:14,087
What?

559
00:54:14,089 --> 00:54:14,987
It's supposed to be
refreshing, right?

560
00:54:14,989 --> 00:54:16,421
You're a... you're a...

561
00:54:16,423 --> 00:54:17,655
A what?

562
00:54:17,657 --> 00:54:19,698
Not that way, Wayne,
it's the other way.

563
00:54:32,205 --> 00:54:34,506
Asshole is the word
he's looking for.

564
00:55:52,495 --> 00:55:54,095
Will anybody notice the light?

565
00:55:58,267 --> 00:55:59,834
They'll think it's just me.

566
00:56:21,426 --> 00:56:24,060
How long have you been here?

567
00:56:27,398 --> 00:56:28,238
15 minutes.

568
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:36,039
No, I mean here with everybody.

569
00:56:36,041 --> 00:56:38,409
I, uh, I met Neil awhile ago.

570
00:56:38,411 --> 00:56:40,944
I was one of the first
ones at the clinic.

571
00:56:45,483 --> 00:56:49,520
Why were you at the clinic?

572
00:56:49,522 --> 00:56:54,425
Uh, because I was
fucked up, again.

573
00:56:54,427 --> 00:56:55,793
How fucked up?

574
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:01,565
What's with all the questions?

575
00:57:01,567 --> 00:57:04,867
I didn't ask you
about Tom, did I?

576
00:57:07,504 --> 00:57:08,537
Maybe you should.

577
00:57:11,107 --> 00:57:14,677
I didn't exactly
get to question him.

578
00:57:14,679 --> 00:57:16,078
So who are you talking to?

579
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,282
Are you talking to Tom,
or are you talking to me?

580
00:57:24,119 --> 00:57:27,021
You don't get it, do you?

581
00:57:27,023 --> 00:57:30,558
When you finally find this,
you... you hold on to it.

582
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:33,127
You don't just sit around
and fucking talk about it.

583
00:57:33,129 --> 00:57:36,131
That... that I don't understand.

584
00:57:36,133 --> 00:57:36,853
Fuck!

585
00:57:41,302 --> 00:57:43,704
You want to talk?

586
00:57:43,706 --> 00:57:47,607
My brother, my older
brother, my only brother,

587
00:57:47,609 --> 00:57:54,349
is serving life in prison for
killing both of our parents.

588
00:57:54,351 --> 00:57:58,319
My... my dad died when I
was three, my real dad.

589
00:57:58,321 --> 00:58:01,923
But my step dad
started fucking me

590
00:58:01,925 --> 00:58:07,529
when I was like...
like seven or eight.

591
00:58:07,531 --> 00:58:12,334
And he would use broom
handles and glass bottles,

592
00:58:12,336 --> 00:58:13,802
he told me it was
because he loved me.

593
00:58:13,804 --> 00:58:18,139
So I guess I... I guess
I sort of believe him.

594
00:58:20,575 --> 00:58:22,042
And maybe it was
love... I don't know,

595
00:58:22,044 --> 00:58:30,045
fucking seemed to make him
happy, but... but it hurt.

596
00:58:32,622 --> 00:58:34,421
I guess that's what
he didn't know.

597
00:58:34,423 --> 00:58:40,594
It really... it
really fucking hurt.

598
00:58:40,596 --> 00:58:43,497
Where was your mother?

599
00:58:43,499 --> 00:58:44,498
She knew.

600
00:58:46,901 --> 00:58:53,274
So... so when my brother found
out, he killed them both.

601
00:58:56,579 --> 00:58:58,780
First him, and then her.

602
00:59:11,328 --> 00:59:12,369
Any other questions?

603
00:59:33,419 --> 00:59:34,986
What's your last name?

604
00:59:37,924 --> 00:59:38,644
Wolf.

605
00:59:45,297 --> 00:59:46,017
What?

606
00:59:49,667 --> 00:59:51,300
What, that's my last name?

607
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,649
Hey... I'll be right back, Okay?

608
01:00:55,173 --> 01:00:57,541
Oh, hi.

609
01:00:57,543 --> 01:01:00,244
Don't worry, they won't bite.

610
01:01:04,915 --> 01:01:10,953
Alice, this is Pete and Lulu.

611
01:01:10,955 --> 01:01:12,655
Hi.

612
01:01:12,657 --> 01:01:18,194
Hey, hey, hey... you're very big.

613
01:01:18,196 --> 01:01:21,730
Ah, they're not so big
once you get used to them.

614
01:01:26,435 --> 01:01:27,701
Hi.

615
01:01:27,703 --> 01:01:29,783
It's good you told
the truth to everybody.

616
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:35,107
You know the last
thing I said to Tom?

617
01:01:38,078 --> 01:01:39,711
You're an asshole.

618
01:01:44,050 --> 01:01:45,316
Did you mean it?

619
01:01:51,256 --> 01:01:52,889
He probably deserved it.

620
01:02:00,232 --> 01:02:01,865
I should go.

621
01:02:12,010 --> 01:02:15,579
Will you be all
right, walking home?

622
01:02:15,581 --> 01:02:17,213
Yeah, I'll be fine.

623
01:02:21,185 --> 01:02:22,185
Excuse me, Lulu.

624
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:41,506
Rachel?

625
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:43,509
Rachel!

626
01:02:43,511 --> 01:02:46,178
Rachel, are you all right?

627
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:47,712
No.

628
01:02:47,714 --> 01:02:49,981
How can I help?

629
01:02:49,983 --> 01:02:52,516
Leave.

630
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:53,278
Leave.

631
01:02:56,487 --> 01:02:57,207
Neil!

632
01:03:05,461 --> 01:03:06,695
I couldn't find you.

633
01:03:06,697 --> 01:03:07,996
What's going on, Alice?

634
01:03:07,998 --> 01:03:10,031
Let-let-let's get you in.

635
01:03:10,033 --> 01:03:11,732
I'm not going back.

636
01:03:11,734 --> 01:03:14,268
Well, you can't stay out here.

637
01:03:14,270 --> 01:03:17,704
You... great healer.

638
01:03:17,706 --> 01:03:18,547
Help me up.

639
01:03:23,777 --> 01:03:26,546
Hand me that, would you please?

640
01:03:26,548 --> 01:03:27,980
Don't touch.

641
01:03:27,982 --> 01:03:28,742
Please.

642
01:03:31,718 --> 01:03:38,991
I can... Rachel, we
can carry you back.

643
01:03:46,666 --> 01:03:48,234
Okay.

644
01:03:49,604 --> 01:03:51,604
Rachel!

645
01:03:51,606 --> 01:03:52,287
No!

646
01:03:58,544 --> 01:03:59,304
Rachel?

647
01:04:03,514 --> 01:04:04,274
Rachel?

648
01:04:11,721 --> 01:04:16,391
Okay, you pull that
cover down, Alice.

649
01:04:16,393 --> 01:04:19,595
Pull it down to take it off
there... take it all the way off

650
01:04:19,597 --> 01:04:21,163
and put it on the chair.

651
01:04:36,815 --> 01:04:39,550
Take that off her, will you?

652
01:04:39,552 --> 01:04:43,520
She's got another here.

653
01:04:43,522 --> 01:04:46,155
Where, I don't know where.

654
01:04:57,502 --> 01:05:01,104
Okay, then I'll lift and you pull.

655
01:05:01,106 --> 01:05:01,787
Okay.

656
01:05:24,864 --> 01:05:25,864
Neil, here.

657
01:05:25,866 --> 01:05:28,499
Here let me... you lift her.

658
01:06:03,207 --> 01:06:05,809
I'll take care of
the rest, Alice.

659
01:06:05,811 --> 01:06:06,651
Thank you.

660
01:06:37,778 --> 01:06:38,579
Charlie?

661
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:45,884
You're back.

662
01:06:45,886 --> 01:06:47,767
Something terrible has happened.

663
01:06:51,490 --> 01:06:52,411
Rachel's dead.

664
01:06:54,693 --> 01:06:58,295
Neil killed her by accident.

665
01:06:58,297 --> 01:07:00,564
She was trying to leave,
ad she was hitting him

666
01:07:00,566 --> 01:07:02,098
with this big stick.

667
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:06,769
And he tried to yank it from
her hands and he killed her.

668
01:07:06,771 --> 01:07:08,036
What are you you saying?

669
01:07:10,639 --> 01:07:11,640
Neil killed Rachel.

670
01:07:15,877 --> 01:07:18,746
But he didn't mean to.

671
01:07:18,748 --> 01:07:22,316
No, no.

672
01:07:22,318 --> 01:07:23,317
Where is he?

673
01:07:23,319 --> 01:07:25,586
He's in the house with her.

674
01:07:25,588 --> 01:07:26,920
I feel terrible.

675
01:07:26,922 --> 01:07:28,454
I don't...

676
01:07:28,456 --> 01:07:29,555
Come here.

677
01:07:29,557 --> 01:07:30,557
Charlie.

678
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:33,526
Get under here.

679
01:07:33,528 --> 01:07:36,129
Till they ring the bell.

680
01:07:39,466 --> 01:07:40,499
You're shaking.

681
01:07:46,807 --> 01:07:50,810
She was dying, Alice.

682
01:07:50,812 --> 01:07:52,144
Rachel was dying.

683
01:07:52,146 --> 01:07:54,080
Everybody knew that.

684
01:07:54,082 --> 01:07:56,982
But Charlie...

685
01:07:56,984 --> 01:07:59,150
Just close your eyes.

686
01:08:03,222 --> 01:08:05,356
We'll find out about it, Okay?

687
01:08:30,919 --> 01:08:34,821
I'll go first, Okay?

688
01:08:34,823 --> 01:08:36,423
The expect me.

689
01:08:50,137 --> 01:08:53,773
It's like that every time,
Wayne, I'm telling you.

690
01:08:53,775 --> 01:08:54,874
Day in and day out.

691
01:09:01,882 --> 01:09:05,050
Alice, we've been
waiting for you.

692
01:09:05,052 --> 01:09:05,974
Here, sit here.

693
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,794
What's going on, Neil?

694
01:09:14,796 --> 01:09:15,996
Shouldn't we wait for Rachel?

695
01:09:15,997 --> 01:09:17,229
Let the man speak.

696
01:09:24,372 --> 01:09:25,739
She died.

697
01:09:25,741 --> 01:09:26,461
What?

698
01:09:31,311 --> 01:09:32,577
When?

699
01:09:32,579 --> 01:09:34,912
Rachel died last night.

700
01:09:34,914 --> 01:09:36,447
How?

701
01:09:36,449 --> 01:09:40,917
She had walked outside alone.

702
01:09:40,919 --> 01:09:44,354
She must have fallen down.

703
01:09:44,356 --> 01:09:46,789
Alice helped me carry her in.

704
01:09:49,493 --> 01:09:52,294
I know how much you loved her.

705
01:09:55,599 --> 01:09:57,198
I loved her.

706
01:09:59,902 --> 01:10:01,502
This is the time.

707
01:10:04,205 --> 01:10:05,606
We should all leave together.

708
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:14,780
Tomorrow, with Rachel.

709
01:10:14,782 --> 01:10:16,281
As she'd want.

710
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:22,620
She's in the bedroom.

711
01:10:29,563 --> 01:10:31,363
You should go see
Rachel if you'd like,

712
01:10:31,365 --> 01:10:33,365
and then we need to
prepare everything.

713
01:10:52,653 --> 01:10:54,054
Charlie?

714
01:10:54,056 --> 01:10:55,588
Charlie, Neil's not
telling everything.

715
01:10:55,590 --> 01:10:57,389
Rachel did not just
die, she was fighting.

716
01:10:57,391 --> 01:10:58,823
I don't believe you.

717
01:10:58,825 --> 01:11:00,292
I was there.

718
01:11:00,294 --> 01:11:01,559
I'm telling you what Neil
said is not what happened.

719
01:11:01,561 --> 01:11:04,427
What the fuck,
Alice... he loved her.

720
01:11:06,964 --> 01:11:07,924
What is that for?

721
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:11,568
Charlie?

722
01:11:17,639 --> 01:11:20,439
Charlie... what are you doing?

723
01:11:20,441 --> 01:11:23,643
You are not going to shoot them.

724
01:11:23,645 --> 01:11:26,278
Please, Charlie, we
can get out of here.

725
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:27,212
We can leave right now.

726
01:11:27,214 --> 01:11:27,879
And maybe we...

727
01:11:27,881 --> 01:11:29,013
No!

728
01:11:29,015 --> 01:11:33,117
You don't want to do this.

729
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:35,252
Oh, you stupid fu...

730
01:11:35,254 --> 01:11:36,587
Shut up, Alice!

731
01:11:36,589 --> 01:11:38,288
You do not want to shoot them!

732
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:39,222
What are you doing?

733
01:11:39,224 --> 01:11:40,156
Just stop it!

734
01:12:00,212 --> 01:12:02,413
May I speak with you?

735
01:12:10,989 --> 01:12:13,358
She was a patient of mine.

736
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:16,227
And you married her.

737
01:12:16,229 --> 01:12:20,365
We found this place
to help people.

738
01:12:20,367 --> 01:12:23,535
You still consider
yourself a doctor?

739
01:12:23,537 --> 01:12:26,470
Do you still consider
yourself a journalist?

740
01:12:29,006 --> 01:12:33,677
This is all about you, isn't it?

741
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:37,782
Yeah, most things
are, don't you think?

742
01:12:37,784 --> 01:12:40,951
The people here are happy
knowing that they'll

743
01:12:40,953 --> 01:12:44,155
be dead sooner than later.

744
01:12:44,157 --> 01:12:46,490
You're selfish.

745
01:12:46,492 --> 01:12:49,494
No, the people in
my profession who

746
01:12:49,496 --> 01:12:56,968
prolong the lives of terribly
tormented people are selfish.

747
01:12:56,970 --> 01:12:59,070
You know this?

748
01:12:59,072 --> 01:13:02,774
Do you think the
people here are unhappy?

749
01:13:02,776 --> 01:13:03,808
They're joyous.

750
01:13:07,146 --> 01:13:10,581
What were you doing
outside last night?

751
01:13:10,583 --> 01:13:13,084
I was wondering what Rachel
was doing in the driveway

752
01:13:13,086 --> 01:13:13,926
last night.

753
01:13:17,822 --> 01:13:19,422
She was dying, Alice.

754
01:13:22,559 --> 01:13:26,396
She didn't believe
in you, anymore.

755
01:13:26,398 --> 01:13:28,531
Is that why you lied to
everybody this morning

756
01:13:28,533 --> 01:13:30,066
about how she died?

757
01:13:33,236 --> 01:13:34,703
We're not so
different, Alice, you

758
01:13:34,705 --> 01:13:41,010
and I. What are you
doing with Charlie?

759
01:13:41,012 --> 01:13:46,415
I mean, you then maybe you
could take care of him?

760
01:13:46,417 --> 01:13:52,088
Make his life a
worthwhile pursuit?

761
01:13:52,090 --> 01:13:56,559
Rid him of his bad memories?

762
01:13:56,561 --> 01:13:58,961
It's about you,
as you would say.

763
01:14:03,933 --> 01:14:04,966
And you?

764
01:14:08,738 --> 01:14:11,340
Why are you going
through with it?

765
01:14:11,342 --> 01:14:17,813
Because it's the one
sure way not to fail them.

766
01:14:17,815 --> 01:14:22,951
And imagine... I wouldn't have
to answer questions like yours.

767
01:14:28,324 --> 01:14:36,326
And Alice, you know, sometimes
when people stop in your life,

768
01:14:38,537 --> 01:14:43,540
And Alice, you know, sometimes
when people stop in your life,

769
01:14:43,542 --> 01:14:45,775
there's nowhere to go.

770
01:14:49,113 --> 01:14:50,746
It's too late.

771
01:15:11,404 --> 01:15:13,638
You're out of your mind.

772
01:15:17,175 --> 01:15:24,649
Jump in the ocean,
oh, nobody's business but mine.

773
01:15:24,651 --> 01:15:29,186
Ain't nobody's
business but mine.

774
01:15:29,188 --> 01:15:30,988
Ain't nobody...

775
01:15:30,990 --> 01:15:35,125
Hey, you all right?

776
01:15:35,127 --> 01:15:36,760
You can come in.

777
01:15:49,374 --> 01:15:50,841
You ready for tomorrow?

778
01:15:50,843 --> 01:15:52,375
Oh, yeah.

779
01:15:52,377 --> 01:15:55,579
I've been ready for
quite some time.

780
01:15:59,685 --> 01:16:06,291
Do you ever think there
might be a way other than...

781
01:16:10,029 --> 01:16:12,831
You're not going to ruin
this for us, are you?

782
01:16:18,137 --> 01:16:18,818
No.

783
01:16:27,478 --> 01:16:29,045
Here, give me some more.

784
01:16:29,047 --> 01:16:30,280
Okay, here we go now.

785
01:16:30,282 --> 01:16:32,915
Scottish humor for you.

786
01:16:34,885 --> 01:16:36,852
Hey, hi!

787
01:16:36,854 --> 01:16:37,853
Alice...

788
01:16:37,855 --> 01:16:39,221
Here?

789
01:16:39,223 --> 01:16:40,555
Yes, please.

790
01:16:40,557 --> 01:16:41,924
Looking very beautiful
and fetching, my dear.

791
01:16:41,926 --> 01:16:44,026
Thank you.

792
01:16:44,028 --> 01:16:45,160
I have a toast.

793
01:16:45,162 --> 01:16:46,528
Ah, Charlie, shut up.

794
01:16:46,530 --> 01:16:47,830
Oh, shut up yourself, Gordon.

795
01:16:47,832 --> 01:16:49,198
Gordon, you've had too much.

796
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:50,299
No.

797
01:16:50,301 --> 01:16:52,567
Shut up.

798
01:16:52,569 --> 01:16:55,037
To Alice.

799
01:16:55,039 --> 01:16:56,238
To Alice.

800
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:57,706
To Alice.

801
01:17:00,410 --> 01:17:05,448
And to all the other
dogs in my life.

802
01:17:05,450 --> 01:17:08,050
Ah, you don't know
when to quit, do you?

803
01:17:08,052 --> 01:17:10,052
I bet your pardon?

804
01:17:10,054 --> 01:17:14,123
That boy doesn't know
how to handle his liquor.

805
01:17:14,125 --> 01:17:15,290
Hey come on.

806
01:17:15,292 --> 01:17:16,324
We should all go
and sit by the fire.

807
01:17:16,326 --> 01:17:18,260
Very good idea.

808
01:17:18,262 --> 01:17:19,828
Come along, darling.

809
01:17:22,865 --> 01:17:28,904
Hey Alice... I wanted
to ask you something.

810
01:17:28,906 --> 01:17:32,108
How was my wife,
when you saw her?

811
01:17:36,847 --> 01:17:39,081
She didn't want to lose you.

812
01:17:44,254 --> 01:17:46,688
I'd have ruined the rest
of her life, you know?

813
01:17:49,426 --> 01:17:50,659
Thanks, though.

814
01:18:18,992 --> 01:18:20,392
Alice!

815
01:18:24,997 --> 01:18:27,398
Hello, Alice.

816
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:28,201
Charlie.

817
01:18:31,269 --> 01:18:34,204
Will you dance with me?

818
01:18:34,206 --> 01:18:35,673
Dance with him, hon.

819
01:18:35,675 --> 01:18:37,341
It'll be good for his soul.

820
01:19:09,645 --> 01:19:10,446
Charlie?

821
01:19:14,215 --> 01:19:16,449
Don't say it, Alice.

822
01:19:16,451 --> 01:19:18,084
Don't say anything.

823
01:20:09,442 --> 01:20:12,077
You all right, man?

824
01:20:12,079 --> 01:20:14,312
Haven't said a word all night.

825
01:20:22,054 --> 01:20:22,774
Yeah.

826
01:20:25,023 --> 01:20:25,824
I'm fine.

827
01:22:10,441 --> 01:22:18,443
If you want to go...
now would be the time.

828
01:22:18,818 --> 01:22:21,785
I can walk you past the meadow
and you can follow the tracks

829
01:22:21,787 --> 01:22:25,022
and just go back
the way you came.

830
01:22:33,398 --> 01:22:34,431
Come with me.

831
01:22:49,349 --> 01:22:50,982
Then I'm staying.

832
01:23:40,803 --> 01:23:41,564
Alice?

833
01:26:42,514 --> 01:26:46,182
So remember,
concentrate on the song.

834
01:26:46,184 --> 01:26:49,553
That'll help.

835
01:26:52,355 --> 01:26:54,316
All right, well,
let's get started.

836
01:27:44,114 --> 01:27:44,795
Okay.

837
01:27:54,691 --> 01:27:55,724
It's Okay.

838
01:28:01,097 --> 01:28:01,729
Wait!

839
01:28:01,731 --> 01:28:05,166
Goddammit, wait.

840
01:28:05,168 --> 01:28:09,203
Stop, stop.

841
01:28:09,205 --> 01:28:10,805
What are you doing, Charlie?

842
01:28:15,009 --> 01:28:15,810
Charlie?

843
01:28:18,145 --> 01:28:20,346
I'm really sorry, everyone.

844
01:28:20,348 --> 01:28:21,647
I'm really, really sorry.

845
01:28:21,649 --> 01:28:24,350
I won't let anybody
bother you, Okay?

846
01:28:24,352 --> 01:28:26,952
Alice, you have to come with me.

847
01:28:26,954 --> 01:28:29,789
Alice, you have to come with me.

848
01:28:29,791 --> 01:28:31,891
Wait, hold on a minute.

849
01:28:31,893 --> 01:28:32,733
Let her go.

850
01:28:57,720 --> 01:28:59,688
Good bye, Alice.

851
01:28:59,690 --> 01:29:00,491
Good bye.

852
01:29:08,029 --> 01:29:09,996
Hi, hi.

853
01:29:09,998 --> 01:29:13,767
Hi, baby, hi, baby.

854
01:29:13,769 --> 01:29:16,837
Hey, I'm going to get
you out of here, OK?

855
01:29:16,839 --> 01:29:19,339
Okay?

856
01:29:19,341 --> 01:29:20,239
Yeah.

857
01:29:46,403 --> 01:29:48,438
Oh, Charlie.

858
01:29:50,074 --> 01:29:51,706
Come on.
