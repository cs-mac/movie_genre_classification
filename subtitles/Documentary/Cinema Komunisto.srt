1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,074


2
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,520
Film history

3
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:19,480
is history of power
of creating a history.

4
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,320
Tito Party

5
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,040
Get ready.

6
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,440
This is the story,
of one country,

7
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:21,720
that no longer exists.

8
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,000
Except on the film.

9
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,240
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia

10
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,120
The cinematography
had priority importance,

11
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,480
within a scope of then Yugoslavia.

12
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,080
We were one of the leading
cinematographies in Europe.

13
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,240
Steva Petrovic
assistant director

14
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,240
Film town was built by
the state of Yugoslavia.

15
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,720
We had big chances.

16
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:27,000
Worked side by side
with renowned world directors,

17
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:30,720
we produced great world decors,
and the world great films.

18
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,840
Veljko Despotovic
Scenographer

19
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:44,640
What's the time?

20
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,240
Time of revolution.

21
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,330
I founded the Association
of Film Actors of Serbia,

22
00:04:04,365 --> 00:04:07,440
and also the Association
of Film Actors of Yugoslavia.

23
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,000
It was wirtten on the door:
"If you don't think you are the best,

24
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,360
don't come in. "

25
00:04:24,179 --> 00:04:26,560
Bata Zivojinovic
film actor

26
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,440
Today the film is much
different, than it was before.

27
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,520
The impact of the film was
enormous.

28
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,960
Film was a powerful weapon
of propaganda and so on.

29
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,040
Gile Djuric
studio director

30
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:03,520
Every country and every government
enforces it's own themes.

31
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,160
It was like that. And it always will be.

32
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,040
That every power
promotes itself.

33
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,600
I think that formula of the film
is to be fair to the theme.

34
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:22,640
Fairness of the film can be
best seen by how long it lasts.

35
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,840
That is the first
and only law of the film.

36
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:33,560
Veljko Bulajic
film director

37
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,960
On a photograph is Tito,
the bandit leader.

38
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,920
Josip Broz Tito,
born in Kumrovec,

39
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,480
on 25th of May, 1892.

40
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:22,481
Comrade Tito, call his eagles to war.

41
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,120
Josip Broz Tito
Marshal of Yugoslavia.

42
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:16,400
Comrade president Tito,

43
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,800
I was your cinematography projectionist, for 32 years.

44
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:26,720
I am grateful for everything.

45
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:41,080
It's wrong.

46
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,560
Leka Konstantinovic.
Tito's projectionist

47
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,520
Berlin is down!

48
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,560
Berlin kaputt!
Hitler kaputt!

49
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,760
Berlin is down.

50
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,520
Brcko-Banovci
Our victory.

51
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,000
The end of war.
May 1945

52
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,840
The year 1945 will stay
in remembrance.

53
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,640
Justice came,
for which we fought.

54
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,680
Everything will be gratious
in new Yugoslavia.

55
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:43,840
The whole country will be
happy.

56
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,920
Beginning of new
Yugoslavia!

57
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,120
Comrades, the war is over.
But the revolution continues!

58
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,200
Our people's revolution!

59
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,200
Yugoslavia was in war
from 1941 till 1945.

60
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,040
The whole country was in ruins.

61
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,640
Belgrade was destroyed
three times by bombs.

62
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:22,600
In 1946 and 1947
230 km of railway was built.

63
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,680
All that was built by youth.
Of course, not only the youth.

64
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,880
For the first week we
exceeded the norm by 70 percent!

65
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,080
I was also there,
mainly as an organizer.

66
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,080
Steady! To the right!
Forward, march!

67
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,000
We slept in the barracks.
In order to demonstrate courage,

68
00:09:57,159 --> 00:10:01,680
we slept on the boards.
We didn't want blankets nor paliasse.

69
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,320
We were like that.

70
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,600
We liked to work for our country.

71
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,760
Part of the middle class,

72
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,080
are skeptical about this feat of ours.

73
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,920
They can't understand
that our 5 socialist years

74
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,840
is like their 55.

75
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:33,000
If it is required my Comrades
we will work day and night.

76
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,880
Our country expects that from us.

77
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:42,560
Along with this struggle
on 1-May, 1947 in Belgrade.

78
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:45,260
The construction
of the film town started.

79
00:10:45,261 --> 00:10:46,861
Vlasta Gavrik.
Scenogrpaher

80
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,240
In 1951 it will have seven
modern studios and other objects.

81
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,240
It will represent adequate technical base,

82
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,820
for the realization of major
tasks of Yugoslavian cinema.

83
00:10:57,079 --> 00:10:59,640
Central film studio, Avala film.

84
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,400
When I came to the film town,

85
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:04,520
it looked something like this paper.

86
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,680
A huge field.

87
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,600
That was the beggining
of our cinema.

88
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:14,760
When nobody knew how to
construct a film town.

89
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:18,800
The Engineer, uncle George will
explain to you about the assignment.

90
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,280
Hello, youngsters.

91
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:25,200
What can I tell you?
Do you see that hill? -Yes.

92
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,720
Let's go.

93
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:31,120
It began by plan
of the construction

94
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,200
of big studios three x three.
The buildings for tone and editing.

95
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,280
The building for carpentry workshop.

96
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:42,680
A little further, on the right side
is the building for wardrobe.

97
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:46,000
Apartments for the actors.
Premises for the mask.

98
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:50,120
Today's reception desk is at the
entrance to the Avala film.

99
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,400
Here is the entrance gate.
This is a piece of asphalt road.

100
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:58,440
It was 300m long,
everybody was proud of it.

101
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,640
Good afternoon. Avala film.
How may I help you?

102
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,200
Good afternoon.
Yes, what do you need?

103
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,920
Just a moment,
hang on please.

104
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,240
Yes we've reached
a decision.

105
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,000
Ranko Petric.
The director of Avala Film

106
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:23,120
85 percent.
Through our privatisation.

107
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:28,560
Avala film was formed
as the central film studio

108
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,400
on Yugoslav Government's decision.

109
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:36,480
Here is the decision,
which was signed by the PM,

110
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,360
Marshal of Yugoslavia,
Josip Broz Tito.

111
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,680
For the party.

112
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,680
The whole concept was the
central film place in Yugoslavia.

113
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:09,760
That 30-50 films should be filmed
in the first five years.

114
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:16,680
That didn't happen.
Only Studio no. 1 was built.

115
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,480
It is one of the largest
studios in Europe.

116
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:27,080
That dimensions exceeded
the possibilities.

117
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,480
Of financing and
also personnel.

118
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:34,120
The idea of socialism is
like the idea of the God.

119
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:40,000
Those are great ideas
which must be supported.

120
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,080
Film town can not be built
just like that.

121
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,060
We are aware that we
will have a lot of difficulties.

122
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,160
Until our workers overcome the obstacles,

123
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:50,040
that are derived from
our backwardness.

124
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:54,720
They understand that the expansion
of socialism is in their own interest.

125
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,800
That it can be achieved
only with the creative enthusiasm.

126
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:02,840
This new, better life that
our people work with their own hands.

127
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,280
That is socialism.
Led by our Party and Comrade Tito.

128
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,560
We heard that from Lenin
and Rusov.

129
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:09,880
That film is an important category
of state and the party propaganda.

130
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,160
Can anybody show on the globe
where is Mother Russia?

131
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,920
I know.

132
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,400
Which Russian you like the most?
- Comrade Stalin.

133
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:26,520
The first attempt to
produce a film

134
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,240
was collaboration with the MOSFILM,
from Soviet Union.

135
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,280
A scene was filmed on
Belgrade city square,

136
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,800
where people carried large portraits of
Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin.

137
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,960
and much smaller portraits
of Josip Broz Tito.

138
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:47,440
Josip Broz was the alpha and omega of that war.

139
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,520
This is due to the terrible delusion.

140
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:54,880
It all flared to terrible
proportions.

141
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:57,440
Tito refuses obedience to Stalin.
May 1948

142
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,400
They want to erase the glory of
our people and their heroic fight.

143
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,480
Stalin threats by invasion
on Yugoslavia, June 1948.

144
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,440
Bureau of fraternal communist countries.

145
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:12,960
Informs on the state of communist parties
of Yugoslavia.

146
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:15,000
Big problems arised.

147
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,080
There was a conflict with the
East European countries.

148
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,040
They attack us from all sides.

149
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:22,360
Titoism - betrayal of socialism.

150
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:28,880
Russia wanted absolute domination.
If they dominate one whole country,

151
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,920
they will ask for other conditions.

152
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,080
Do you support Tito or Stalin?
- De Gaull

153
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,440
Whole my life I praise Stalin.
Now you want to take his picture off.

154
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:45,240
Wait Straia, maybe we should
remove the other picture.

155
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,840
Consequence of the resolution
of Inform-Bureau.

156
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,240
The withdrawal of Soviet films
from our distribution.

157
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,400
You don't have right
Comrade Stalin.

158
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:02,560
This is what we tell you the people!

159
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:08,760
Later on the unit was formed.

160
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,160
Their task was to provide
movies from the other side.

161
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,400
That means, mostly from
Hollywood production.

162
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,000
"Tarzan triumphs"

163
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:17,880
I am on the right side.

164
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,800
The leader is on the right side.

165
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,520
In the Army is also like that.

166
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:33,520
I was not afraid.
The first time I came I was.

167
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,120
Not from Tito but from the work.

168
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,040
The first time I came.
All the cabinet was there.

169
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:45,120
What kind of meeting that was- I don't know.

170
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:47,200
He looked at me.

171
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,560
"When did you arrive here?"
- "Today", I responded.

172
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,920
From where?
- From guard.

173
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,440
He pat me on the shoulder.
"Good", he said.

174
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,600
No one else said hello.
They were passing by.

175
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:27,520
Every day Tito and me watched films.

176
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,080
He watched.
I stood here.

177
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,160
And when he goes somewhere.
I set-up the film.

178
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:39,440
Even if it was late in the night.
He watched the film.

179
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,120
President Tito was
a great admirer of the film.

180
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:50,160
From what I know
and others know better.

181
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:53,560
He went to cinema every night.

182
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:57,520
He saw all our films.
He loved western-film.

183
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:02,440
He loved Kirk Douglas and
John Wayne.

184
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,280
I forgot their names. I don't work for 27 years.

185
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,200
Once I started the projection
at 3 a. m.

186
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:39,080
President asked me:
"Why you did not go home?"

187
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,840
I said. That I have a great film.

188
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:48,920
"What kind of film?"
- "War film. "

189
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,560
He sat and watched it till the end.

190
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,680
Around 5:30 the film ended.

191
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,960
His limousine came and he left.

192
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,400
I wondered, when does this man sleep.

193
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:11,560
On 20th of October
the Liberation Day of Belgrade.

194
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,400
President of the republic
Josip Broz Tito.

195
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,280
Opened a permanent exhibition
of Yugoslav war history.

196
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,960
War museum
Belgrade, Serbia.

197
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:22,600
On the opening ceremony was
Jovanka Broz, Tito's spouse

198
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:25,360
and Yugoslav top executives.

199
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:30,440
"This museum will be the historical monument. "
Tito said.

200
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,560
"My wish is that we do not fill this Museum
with some future battles. "

201
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,240
Show the order
to all fighters.

202
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,240
"The window must fall tonight. "

203
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:36,640
Today is hard to speak about the wars
that happened to us.

204
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,200
We made films about the people's liberation battle.

205
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,520
We didn't have criteria
of how this must be done.

206
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:52,720
Many of you are asking who we are.
We are Partisans.

207
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:56,240
We don't recognize the occupation.
We struggle for freedom.

208
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,240
Fellow proletarians!

209
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,760
Death to Fascism!
- Freedom to the people!

210
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,640
Death to Fascism!
- Freedom to the people!

211
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,040
Fellow aviators, Death to Fascism!
- Freedom to the people.

212
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
These films were very authentic.
But in some places it was exaggerated.

213
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:18,320
613,613,
Mayday.

214
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:21,320
Cousin arrived. Cousin arrived.

215
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:26,240
No trace of the bandit.
Do not underestimate them.

216
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,280
Grandpa, what is that roar?

217
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,880
Soldiers are killing enemies.
Frees Kozara.

218
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:47,480
There were films,

219
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,800
that were telling the truth.
That were critical.

220
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:56,120
Films that we do not have today.

221
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,560
Army goes!

222
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:11,280
Proletarians go!

223
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:34,720
These are not scenes from the documentary film.

224
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,160
Neither authentic war footage.

225
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:40,560
It is one of the shooting day of the
"The Partisans",

226
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,480
from the director Stole Jankovic.
These are soldiers,

227
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,560
that are on military service with camera and actors:
domestic and foreign.

228
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,840
I am from Kragujevac.

229
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,360
- With whom you befriended from the actors?

230
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:55,520
With Mr. Bata.

231
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,360
- Where are you from? Slovenia.
I was determined to go to German group,

232
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:04,280
but I ran to the partisans
without anybody noticing.

233
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:06,440
So I'm a Partisan now.

234
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:08,440
- Who are you?
Dead Italiian.

235
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:13,360
- And, when you're alive?
Salih Krasnic from Bosnia.

236
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:17,320
I'm serving the military service.

237
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:22,200
Comrade Commander of the Battalion.
Would you like to tell us,

238
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,560
are the soldiers losing time
compared to the classic military service?

239
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:32,920
I would not agree with that.
Because, this is how

240
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:38,240
we remember and encourage
the way of Partisan fighting.

241
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,200
Let them closer and without excitement!

242
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,840
Fire!

243
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,720
Attack!

244
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:56,200
Partisan war films were funded
and loved.

245
00:25:57,319 --> 00:26:01,040
Bata Zivojinovic, myself
and other actors were visiting factories

246
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,920
and talked about how good this film will be.
That is how we collected money.

247
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:07,240
They understood the role of film.

248
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,200
It was interesting to
to see actors in uniform.

249
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,600
When we said that we need money
to complete the film,

250
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:19,280
they gave without asking
how much.

251
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:22,800
The whole of Europe was brought to its knees.

252
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,920
But here on Balkans,
Yugoslav Partisans are outsmarting us.

253
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,920
Fire Comrade! -I don't know.
How you don't know to shoot? Fire!

254
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,000
That is how many of the partisan films incurred.
That were terrific.

255
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:22,040
There are films, from the beginning
till the end I kill Germans.

256
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,000
Retreat!

257
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,960
Hitler before death said:
"Kill Bata Zivojinovic"

258
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,560
They attacked us here,
here and here.

259
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:00,640
Tito was very eager

260
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:05,840
to shoot films
about War and Partisans.

261
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,600
Attention, Division Brandenburg.

262
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:13,800
Josip Broz, known as Tito.

263
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,200
The film crew, soldiers and commanders
involved in the shooting of the film

264
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:23,200
sent a welcome telegram to Comrade Tito,
at the beginning of the shooting.

265
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,600
Highly respected Comrade President.

266
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:31,840
This morning will be received

267
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:35,120
the first copy of the film, from the laboratory. Stop.

268
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,560
Thus ending a long-term work,

269
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:41,640
in which we invested
our knowledge and skills.

270
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:45,560
In order to fulfill our duty
to the revolution. Stop.

271
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,880
We will be honoured

272
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:54,200
to show you the results of our work.

273
00:28:54,839 --> 00:29:01,280
Copy of the film will be
available from tomorrow. Stop.

274
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:14,280
I'm talking how much Tito was
familiar with creating films.

275
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,840
Especially films about him.

276
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:21,520
He was not a layman who would
say what you've done-you've done.

277
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:26,960
He was very analytical and
to the detail.

278
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:32,280
For us and the environment
we were proud of what he said.

279
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:38,760
Here is the example of what
he wrote on screenplays.

280
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,360
"Arrange that I can watch the film at home. "

281
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,160
"This does not correspond to reality. "

282
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:51,960
"I will read the scenario and give my opinion,

283
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,960
I should not be directly shown. "

284
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,240
Here are the authentic German tanks,
from the war.

285
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:16,360
I keep all these photos.
I can enlarge this photograph,

286
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:19,600
and put it into any office
from that time.

287
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,040
Scenographer does that.

288
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,920
Where is Tito?

289
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:35,160
Tito especially liked,

290
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:38,480
that his car in the film has
the correct numbers on a car-plate.

291
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:41,760
This is Tito's car.

292
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,680
He was thrilled that they knew
the exact car number,

293
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,280
that the Germans captured.

294
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,760
Tito is there.
Tito must be there.

295
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,480
Gather all the men and attack.

296
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,680
I have often asked myself,
Mr. Captain,

297
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,640
what makes these unarmed, barefoot people
oppose us and get killed?

298
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,920
What is that strange force that guides them?

299
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:31,040
...Partisan is on the guard...

300
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,680
They believe.
They are convinced

301
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:42,760
that the world thanks to their efforts
will be different and better.

302
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,400
That is how they infecteded the masses.

303
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:49,600
I think that is the secret of
their eternal and impossible endurance.

304
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,280
Tito's residency
Uzicka, Belgrade

305
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:25,880
I have not been here since 1980.

306
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,600
I still keep the key from
the forest house.

307
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:43,720
I want to give it to someone who runs it.

308
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:47,000
Here you go.
- Thank you. Welcome.

309
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,960
I have another one but I
will keep it.

310
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:11,560
NATO bombed this residency
in 1999.

311
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:30,640
The film screen was there.

312
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:37,440
My equipment was there.
I set it up every night.

313
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,320
Chairs were there.

314
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:47,720
Comrade Jovanka and Comrade President
were sitting there.

315
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,800
At 6 in the evening I came here
and set it all up.

316
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,720
Comrade president asked me:
"Which movie is on?"

317
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,480
I respond, sometimes I give him the scenario.
And then watched the movie.

318
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,720
When they are alone, they have quick dinner.
In 15 minutes.

319
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,680
But when the guests are there
it's not known when they will end.

320
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:29,040
Then, I sit and wait.
That was the hardest part - when I sit and wait.

321
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,320
This is Belgrade
the capital of Yugoslavia.

322
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,520
Two big rivers, nine hills,
one million inhabitants.

323
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:59,280
In the last 2000 years
it was destroyed 54 times.

324
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,600
Today is Friday, 29 April
119 day of the year.

325
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,200
The Sun rises at 4.40.

326
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,440
Film town in Belgrade,

327
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:45,960
revived this year as never was before.

328
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:50,600
Avala film, this year made several movies
for our and foreign companies.

329
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:54,880
Here are a few scenes
from the film "Roman Virgins".

330
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:05,560
1962 was a turning point
in the activities of the film town.

331
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:11,880
At the head of the company came
Mr. Ratko Drazevic.

332
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:16,140
He was a completely different
personality than of his predecessors.

333
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,420
What is it? Do you like me?

334
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:24,180
It occurred to me that I know you.

335
00:37:24,381 --> 00:37:27,881
Many people know me brother.
Do you want something to drink?

336
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:31,640
In Avala film,
in the era of these co-productions

337
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:37,120
came one true european mag,
producer in the american sense.

338
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,800
That's how they called him,
Hollywood mag from the Balkans.

339
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:44,840
Well-known Ratko Drazovic.

340
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:54,840
A dangerous partisan, member of the group
that caught Draza Mihajlovic.

341
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,680
He had that experience,
he spoke foreign languages and so on.

342
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:11,720
I think, there was a role played by his former company Udba.

343
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,320
He have killed and
everything.

344
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,640
There was some kind of foreign aid from US
that was intended for our country.

345
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,960
He resold it to South America.

346
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,480
Money was probably used for
goverment suspicious jobs.

347
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:42,440
That man labeled our cinematography
and its beginnings.

348
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:49,840
When he came he was
seen as fear and suspense.

349
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,680
He made order
in Avala film.

350
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,720
In year or two he made
many foreign partnerships.

351
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,960
He brought Americans.

352
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,200
His job was
to start with big co-productions,

353
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,520
and to bring the money.

354
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:14,460
Of course, that money was going to the state.

355
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:16,761
"Long ships"

356
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:30,000
The world came to Avala-film,
through Ratko Drazovic.

357
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,800
And Avala film went to the World.

358
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:59,520
"Long ships" was
a beggining of our entrance

359
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,640
in the world cinematography.
Producing of films

360
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,240
that will be shown to
the whole world.

361
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,560
Why did you decide to shoot a movie
in Yugoslavia?

362
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,320
Not one studio in Europe
and America is big enough.

363
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,640
It was necessary to
build facilities

364
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,320
in which we have shown
our abilities.

365
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:29,240
We shown that we are equally good as Americans.
That they are not better than us.

366
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:34,600
We attracted them with the perfect facilities
and with trained crew.

367
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:40,200
Although we learnt from them,
we did not show that.

368
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,440
That's the movie business.
Film is finnaly - a lie.

369
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:48,320
We are just trying
to be as realistic as possible.

370
00:40:53,800 --> 00:41:00,520
Ratko Drazovic requested to strictly
follow the instructions:

371
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,520
Americans should not feel that
they are not in Hollywood.

372
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,600
Everyone here keeps
repeating two words:

373
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,800
"Nema problema"

374
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:18,240
That means: No problem.

375
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,200
Obviously, we do not have anything
except problems.

376
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,440
If the house got demolished,
"Nema problema".

377
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,880
We started filming
summer scenes.

378
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:33,800
The sky was beautifully blue.
Suddenly, it started to snow.

379
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,440
If a team does not appear or it is
not ready - "Nema problema".

380
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:39,720
We changed the plan and
started shooting winter scenes.

381
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,200
But the snow melted,
the spring came.

382
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,840
"Nema problema, it will snow again"

383
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,240
Last week in Belgrade,
we had a chance to meet

384
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,600
some well-known film workers.

385
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:06,080
Among others - Dawn Adams,
the partner of Charlie Chaplin.

386
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,760
Neo-realist director
Giuseppe De Santis

387
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,040
began preparations
for filming.

388
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:13,760
With his assistent Veliko Bulajic,
the casting director.

389
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:18,200
English film crew with Anthony
Hopkins and David Swift,

390
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,080
record their version of "War and Peace"
in Deliblatska Pescara.

391
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:26,320
In Belgrade Fair Hall 1, started shooting
of "Marco Polo".

392
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:29,680
Marco Polo is played by the young
French actor Alain Delon.

393
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:33,560
Hotel Metropol became a place
of residence for film-stars.

394
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,240
On its terrace we met
protagonists of the film 'Nevihta'.

395
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,480
Roy Thinnes.

396
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:51,600
Anthony Quinn recorded a film here.

397
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:16,440
Metropol was the best hotel.
Deluxe.

398
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:19,320
The best hotel in Belgrade.

399
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:25,000
All the most important
film-stars have stayed here.

400
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:32,360
The sudden arrival of Mr. Hitchcock
upseted everyone except him.

401
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:55,480
Sofia Loren and Carlo Ponti,

402
00:43:55,639 --> 00:43:58,520
were visiting President Tito
and his wife Jovanka Broz.

403
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,120
That is Sofia.

404
00:44:02,199 --> 00:44:07,880
You took her to Brioni? -Yes.
Once me, the other time Veljko Bulajic.

405
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,720
But I did not bother her,
he did.

406
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:17,000
Was she beautifull?
- Who? Sofia Loren.

407
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:20,280
Was she pretty? -Great.
- A little big, but.

408
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:41,760
They knew that Yugoslavia is
a country that has everything:

409
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:46,520
An army, 50-100 tanks, cannons,
air-planes. Everything.

410
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,560
I didn't need to take the director
to the spot. He trusted me.

411
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:57,640
I've showed him the places
where I was filming.

412
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,840
I love these long photos,
in which the whole landscape can be seen.

413
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,960
I know every stream,
river, lake, hill and forest.

414
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:10,280
Here you have this,

415
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,160
but there is a better forest in Macedonia.

416
00:45:13,559 --> 00:45:18,480
For "Marco Polo"
we built the Beijing from the 13th century.

417
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:22,160
Then we built a palace
for Kublai Kahn.

418
00:45:23,239 --> 00:45:28,880
It turned out that the money was
main political motive for the job.

419
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:32,080
The country
needed foreign money then.

420
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,320
Co-productions was great help
for our country.

421
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:38,640
Everything was done perfectly.
We were aware,

422
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,120
that we need the foreigners.
Because of dollars that they've brought here.

423
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:03,920
For every shooting day we needed
at least one hundred statists.

424
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,280
Let us in.
- I can't.

425
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:10,280
Yesterday you said that statists
come today.

426
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,760
Today I say to you nicely
to come tomorrow.

427
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:20,920
It often happened that on recording and
in the film crew,

428
00:46:21,159 --> 00:46:26,040
came people from state security
to check what is going on.

429
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,280
Is that you? -Yes.

430
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,520
Steva Petrovic, who was
the main representative of Avala film.

431
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:44,000
Was in all co-productions,
as an assistant director and director.

432
00:46:44,199 --> 00:46:49,920
He liked to appear in the shortest scenes
in these films.

433
00:46:59,719 --> 00:47:02,520
They've shortened the sentence!
First, it was:

434
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:14,960
We recorded so much films
and earned a lot of money.

435
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,640
It is a true shame that we
don't do it anymore.

436
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,600
And that Avala film collapsed.

437
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,440
You can't even find it in
a phonebook anymore.

438
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:36,040
As an example of the quality of products that were made in
Film town.

439
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,640
I'll show you the costume of
one of the main Viking's,

440
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:47,120
that was made specially
for the film "Long ships".

441
00:47:48,679 --> 00:47:51,880
It was made in 1962,
today is the year 2006,

442
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,360
means that it is retained
for almost 50 years.

443
00:47:55,559 --> 00:47:59,080
and it is still used for recording
TV-commercials.

444
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:08,520
From the rich collection of costumes
of Avala film

445
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,800
we present you the suit of
King Milan Obrenovic.

446
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:21,240
It was used
at least in 20 movies.

447
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,440
When Anthony Hopkins
came to Belgrade.

448
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:43,080
To record
"War and Peace. "

449
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:47,240
We spoke to our trusted
co-worker.

450
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,200
The film was filmed successfully,

451
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,840
an the film "War and Peace"
seized the world.

452
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:56,040
Was it like that? -Yes, it was.

453
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:06,760
The laboratory of Avala film.
Currently without electricity.

454
00:49:58,039 --> 00:50:01,120
Dan Tana.
producer

455
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:25,120
I am shocked to see this place.
Once beautifull - now ugly.

456
00:50:26,519 --> 00:50:29,280
Neglected and uninsured.

457
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:34,560
A lot of money and effort was used
to build it.

458
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:40,600
It is a tragedy that it collapsed
and that it will dissapear.

459
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,480
Until recently we have
fought to preserve it.

460
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:04,800
It was going
to a disaster.

461
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:09,040
However, it went to a disaster.

462
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:01,040
List of films shown to Tito,
1949-1980.

463
00:52:01,239 --> 00:52:06,000
Since 1949,
I have kept a record of movies for every day.

464
00:52:06,199 --> 00:52:08,960
That president watched.

465
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:13,080
I've got logs for each year.

466
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:21,480
That way I know that
I've played 8801 film.

467
00:52:24,519 --> 00:52:26,840
My work-day?

468
00:52:27,079 --> 00:52:30,080
Me and the driver went to look
for a film that day.

469
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,920
We went to Morava film.

470
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:37,760
If we dont find a film there,
then we go to Avala film.

471
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:41,840
We drove around Belgrade
for two hours.

472
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,000
You cant have good movie
every day.

473
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,600
I wanted to cry.

474
00:52:52,199 --> 00:52:54,440
I couldnt get a movie.

475
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,920
How many times I borrowed movies
from cinema 'Beograd' and 'Jadran'.

476
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:14,760
When they finished I
took the reels.

477
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,080
They finished a show about 21h.

478
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:22,640
Me and the chauffer took the film
to Uzicka.

479
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,280
We chased it around.
I reversed the reels, played.

480
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,360
I brought the film once.
That he watched couple of years ago.

481
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:52,600
I thought that he wont remember.

482
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:56,480
He said:
"We saw this already!"

483
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:00,360
I said: "Comrade president. "

484
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:05,360
"It was probably a long time ago. "

485
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:07,840
" Five years ago" He said.

486
00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:11,640
I looked in the book.
He was right.

487
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:16,240
It was exactly five years.

488
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,920
It is really strange.

489
00:54:21,079 --> 00:54:23,560
Do you like it?
- Yes, it is nice.

490
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,480
Who's theater is this?
- State's.

491
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:09,800
The future of our country
will be in good hands.

492
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:14,800
We don't need to fear for
tommorow when we wont be here.

493
00:55:15,239 --> 00:55:19,160
There is a young generation,
that will know how to manage Yugoslavia.

494
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:24,240
The nation that has youth like this,
dont need to fear the future.

495
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,920
You weren't born then.
That was a good country.

496
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:52,120
Country. That built flats.
People finished schools,

497
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,000
got jobs, made love, traveled.

498
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:15,480
Roman arena,
Pula, Croatia

499
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:31,440
Yugoslavian cinematography
began producing so many films.

500
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:34,560
That we had to show them somewhere.

501
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,760
Not only in cinema,
to earn money.

502
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:41,440
But to the people. For they own good
and illumination.

503
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:44,400
Yugoslavian Film Festival.

504
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:57,040
I was not in Pula for a long time.
But I kept it in a good memory.

505
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:02,520
That was one elite life
of Yugoslavian film.

506
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,000
I thought it was going for the prize.

507
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,440
Forward, for a prize.

508
00:57:27,159 --> 00:57:32,120
Cnematography in Yugoslavia
highlighted social recognition

509
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:38,040
with the film festival in Pula.
At Vespasianus Arena.

510
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:44,960
They have made seatings,
stage and big canvas.

511
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,560
Dear guests.
Dear public. Good Evening.

512
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:54,360
Welcome to the 25th
festival of Yugoslavian film.

513
00:58:06,679 --> 00:58:09,800
It was a great atmosphere.
Scenarists came,

514
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,120
film workers, actors and producers.

515
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:17,360
Guests from the whole world.

516
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:19,600
Arena was always full.

517
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:22,960
10000-15000 people.
Every evening.

518
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,560
How do you rate your film year?

519
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:45,680
I've seen almost every movie.
And those that will come.

520
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:50,360
It is proven, as it is every year.
That the actors are always good.

521
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:54,720
This year the only problem is
who will win the prize.

522
00:58:55,559 --> 00:58:59,480
"Award Pula's Arena"
was important. Like the oscar,

523
00:58:59,679 --> 00:59:03,000
in America.
Undoubtedly it will have a lot of views.

524
00:59:03,199 --> 00:59:08,880
One who gets the gold arena,
he got himself a job. It was like that.

525
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,480
I will show you the award.

526
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:14,520
The silver one is similar,
it is only from silver. This one's from gold.

527
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,920
Pula was a huge war port.

528
00:59:26,199 --> 00:59:29,960
If it happened that not enough
tickets were sold.

529
00:59:30,119 --> 00:59:33,400
War ships came with 2000-3000 mornars,

530
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:35,800
in nice white uniforms. With hats.

531
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,680
Those mornars applaud
and make the atmosphere. It was great atmosphere.

532
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:43,960
In presence of
the president of republic and his wife,

533
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:47,000
with other
respected guests,

534
00:59:47,159 --> 00:59:51,680
the 14th festival of Yugoslavian
film was opened in pula's arena.

535
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:08,480
Tito's residency.
The island Brioni, Croatia

536
01:00:19,559 --> 01:00:22,400
Pula is attractive on another line.

537
01:00:22,599 --> 01:00:25,960
It was close to an island called Brioni.

538
01:00:29,079 --> 01:00:33,000
Because the films were shown in Pula,
we went on reception

539
01:00:33,239 --> 01:00:36,360
to Comrade Tito's residency.

540
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:45,360
When it was Pula Festival,
Tito watched the films day earlier.

541
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:48,040
And gave his thought.

542
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:55,880
The main spy and informer was the man
who was film-operator on Brioni.

543
01:00:58,119 --> 01:01:01,520
That Leka, he was Tito for us actors.

544
01:01:02,719 --> 01:01:07,120
He was link between Tito, film and us.
We waited to hear what Tito said to Leka.

545
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,200
About film, actors and everything
in particular.

546
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:17,640
Not everyone could approach to Leka.

547
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:21,560
But the one who aprroached to Leka.
We asked him what Tito have said to him.

548
01:01:22,599 --> 01:01:27,680
Whole city knew what Leka said,
what he heard that Tito said.

549
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:32,320
When people heard the news,
that Tito said that Bata Zivojinovic

550
01:01:32,519 --> 01:01:36,240
is the best actor.
Bata won the award.

551
01:01:46,599 --> 01:01:51,480
Bata Zivojinovic said that he
would like to visit Brioni.

552
01:01:51,719 --> 01:01:55,120
Comrade Jovanka said:
"Why you didn't bring him?"

553
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,560
"Comrade Jovanka,

554
01:01:57,719 --> 01:02:00,760
I don't have that power to bring him. "

555
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:03,840
Tommorow night she urged.

556
01:02:04,199 --> 01:02:07,520
The most prominent event
for the time of the festival,

557
01:02:07,639 --> 01:02:11,240
was arrival of festival delegation
to president Tito on Brioni.

558
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:14,480
On that occasion,
president of council of festival

559
01:02:14,639 --> 01:02:17,680
France Stiglic gave the Gold Arena award
to president Tito.

560
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:22,600
Then he guested the authors:

561
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:28,160
Myself, Sasa Petrovic,
Fadil Hadzic and France Stiglic.

562
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:33,400
We talked about
state of cinematography.

563
01:02:33,639 --> 01:02:37,120
We expected to get a support
for our opinions.

564
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:52,760
Milena Dravic and Bata Zivojinovic
were there.

565
01:02:53,159 --> 01:02:55,920
Bata charmed Tito.

566
01:02:56,039 --> 01:03:00,000
Tito was delighted with his charm.
Bata is very witty.

567
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:05,880
He said: "Comrade president.
You have a very beautiful house. "

568
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:09,240
Tito responded:
"It is not mine, it is state house. "

569
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:12,640
"Then I will come
here with my wife for the summer. "

570
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:15,640
It turned out that he invited me
to tell him the jokes,

571
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,120
that people were telling about him.

572
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:25,600
I noticed the michrophone rod,

573
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:29,840
that got close to us,

574
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,720
to record our speech.

575
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:36,680
"Come on, tell me" He said.
"I don't want. "

576
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:40,600
"How's that. "
"If I tell you, they will arrest me. "

577
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,560
"Who will arrest you.
I arrest in this country. "

578
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:53,920
Tito asked me,
which will be my next work

579
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:58,160
I responded
that I would like to direct "The Battle of Neretva. "

580
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:04,640
It seemed to me, that
the humane battle for wounded on Neretva

581
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:10,120
is very inspirative for
one true, powerful war film. Epic film.

582
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:13,640
He thought.

583
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:18,760
We were silent.

584
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:24,920
And then he said: "That is
not it, what my co-workers told me

585
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:27,720
let it be how ever
you want. "

586
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:35,240
I saw how Veljko Bulajic approached and
whispered something to president.

587
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:39,120
President turned
and looked at me.

588
01:04:39,719 --> 01:04:42,240
He called me.

589
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:48,360
He said that he really cared
about making of that movie.

590
01:04:48,519 --> 01:04:54,280
That our history should teach the
upcoming generations...

591
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:59,000
And that Avala-Film is required
to participate.

592
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:02,240
"Make a contact with them,

593
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:06,440
and pay them 400 million
from the budget reserves. "

594
01:05:08,719 --> 01:05:11,800
Population of Prozor,
Gracanica, Jablanica and the surroundings

595
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:15,240
saluted to the strateg of "Battle on Neretva. "

596
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:19,160
Until the end of the road where the celebration took place of
the 35. aniversary of that battle.

597
01:05:20,039 --> 01:05:22,640
Long lived comrade Tito!

598
01:05:28,119 --> 01:05:30,000
President Tito went to the

599
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:32,760
memorial park
on the hill of Neretva.

600
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:36,400
Here, on the stone monument,
on which are engraved

601
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:40,160
his historical words
'Wounded can not be left"

602
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:44,040
president fired up the eternal flame.

603
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,680
"The Battle of Neretva"

604
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Cameraman Tomislav Pinter
and director Veljko Bulajic

605
01:06:24,159 --> 01:06:27,120
recorded war events on the
upper flow of the river Neretva.

606
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:30,840
That was, 25 years ago, of
significant importance for our future.

607
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,600
We are participating in shooting of the scenes,

608
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:39,640
in which our soldiers fought for
saving the 4500 wounded.

609
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:53,040
The recording lasted 16 months.
On unseen Bosnian Hills.

610
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:57,760
The recording lasted so long,

611
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:01,480
that two generations of soldiers
finished miltary service, in the film.

612
01:07:12,679 --> 01:07:15,720
In the most spectacular
Yugoslavian film,

613
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:19,080
are engaged the most famous
film-stars

614
01:07:19,239 --> 01:07:22,160
and the most famous
Yugoslavian actors.

615
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:28,200
Bulajic has a special talent,
which can be seen in the film.

616
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:33,080
His mass scenes are emotional
to the public.

617
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:41,280
That is a special gift, gift that
we didnt see even in Cecil B. De Mille.

618
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:46,360
Actors, be more proud.
The minister is speaking, the senator is speaking!

619
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:49,200
That is not happening every day.

620
01:07:53,159 --> 01:07:56,120
Brother cetniks, hear me!

621
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:01,640
Tito's head will
soon fall here-in front of my legs!

622
01:08:03,719 --> 01:08:07,600
Prominent world-actors were guests
at the Tito's residence at Brioni.

623
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:12,160
President Tito evoked memories of
the fateful days of the last war,

624
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,800
where he made an imortant decision
to demolish the bridge

625
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:19,920
to deceive the enemy,
and immediately build antoher one,

626
01:08:20,119 --> 01:08:22,280
to rescue the wounded soldiers.

627
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:26,640
The artists have listened to Tito's words
about dramatic historic happenings.

628
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:29,400
The artists will plant those stories
on the film screen.

629
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,960
Run away now! Go!

630
01:08:38,359 --> 01:08:40,120
Fire!

631
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:48,200
Forestman, let's run!
You start! Wounded run!

632
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:57,320
"Down with force and injustice
People will judge it themself,

633
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:05,760
Go away night shadows,
our day has come "

634
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:19,400
What is this?

635
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,680
I don't know.

636
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:32,640
Storm!

637
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,680
Memo Begovic
statist

638
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:46,800
In '68 shooting of a movie
began here,

639
01:09:47,039 --> 01:09:50,320
and the director was Montenegrian,
Veljko Bulajic.

640
01:10:00,119 --> 01:10:04,160
He looked for someone who plays the flaute,
to fulfill the film.

641
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:08,080
I said to him: "What else do you need?"

642
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:12,560
"I didn't catch the camera right
return and repeat it. "

643
01:10:13,359 --> 01:10:15,760
And that was it.

644
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:29,520
This kind of films by equipment,
couldn't make even the best in the world.

645
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,960
Push it.

646
01:10:38,279 --> 01:10:42,000
Americans, they couldn't show
'Battlle of Neretva', no theory.

647
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:47,520
So much planes,tanks and else,
and to throw it in the river

648
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,960
to be seen in the film,
there's no one but us that can make that.

649
01:10:56,079 --> 01:10:58,680
When Tito said that we can.

650
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:04,720
When he confirmed, we could do
whatever we wanted.

651
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:06,760
You could destroy the bridge.

652
01:11:08,439 --> 01:11:12,600
When I came to Jablanica with the crew,
I proposed

653
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:16,680
to demolish the bridge for the film.

654
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:20,040
What are you going to do with the bridge?
- To destroy it.

655
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,240
Bridge?

656
01:11:24,439 --> 01:11:31,200
Without destroying the bridge in this way
ta prizor ne bi bil tako dober.

657
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:35,800
What's going on, Duka?

658
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,680
Vlado, destroy the bridge!
We must destroy the bridge.

659
01:11:39,319 --> 01:11:41,960
Ivan, that is Tito's order.

660
01:11:43,319 --> 01:11:44,960
The end!

661
01:11:45,119 --> 01:11:47,720
We have made a
pirotechnic probe,

662
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:52,520
for the effects, light and smoke.
To be sure

663
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:55,680
that we catch
the destroying of bridge.

664
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:00,400
We had six cameras.
I gave a command to record with all six.

665
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:06,120
And recording started.
It was a dramatic moment.

666
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:09,880
We risked it.

667
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,080
It was perfectly organised.

668
01:12:26,399 --> 01:12:32,280
With Russian and German pirotechnic equipment,
and Yugoslavian cameras. It was perfect.

669
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:38,880
It's interesting, when bridge
was destroyed,

670
01:12:40,279 --> 01:12:44,040
When bridge fell
cameras were recording,

671
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:49,920
not a single camera recorded
the actual fall of the bridge.

672
01:12:50,279 --> 01:12:53,720
Wait, but you can see that in the film.
- Yes, but that's a maquete.

673
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:11,440
No. Maquete was different.

674
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:16,040
Maquete was used before that,
for practice.

675
01:13:16,279 --> 01:13:18,600
We destroyed real bridge.

676
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:35,000
I proposed to house of Jablanica,

677
01:13:35,159 --> 01:13:39,760
to build the museum
on both sides of the bridge.

678
01:13:40,079 --> 01:13:44,440
In order to attract the turists.

679
01:13:45,159 --> 01:13:48,880
How long it have been
tourist attraction, I do not know.

680
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:53,640
People were standing by the bridge
and photographing it.

681
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:58,600
I do not know what is now
with the bridge, is someone in charge

682
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:03,600
and is it an object that would
atrract the tourists.

683
01:14:55,479 --> 01:14:58,280
Glory and thank you.

684
01:16:00,359 --> 01:16:03,120
People fix the bridge!

685
01:16:10,279 --> 01:16:16,080
'Battle of Neretva' had
big sucess.

686
01:16:16,359 --> 01:16:20,560
It was nominated for an oscar.

687
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:28,560
The film was shown
to whole Europe.

688
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:34,680
President of judges in Monte Carlo,
close friend of Pablo Picasso,

689
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:39,680
said to Picasso that
he saw an interesting film.

690
01:16:40,039 --> 01:16:43,760
He proposed to Picasso
that he make the plaquette for the film.

691
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:50,040
As you can see,
Picasso made a plaquette for the film.

692
01:16:58,319 --> 01:17:02,040
That was the second and final
plaquette that he made.

693
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:05,280
The first he made was in 1928
for Bunuel,

694
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,240
this was the second plaquette
in his career.

695
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:40,560
From 1948 till 1970
I was'nt on vacation.

696
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:49,280
When I went to retirement in 1970,
general Balenovic went to Tito.

697
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:52,120
"Comrade president,

698
01:17:52,319 --> 01:17:55,920
Aleksandar Konstantinovic Leka
should be retired. "

699
01:17:56,079 --> 01:17:59,440
Comrade president thought
and then responded:

700
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:04,440
"Let him retire,
but to continue working with me. "

701
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:10,120
This is the watch, that I received.

702
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:14,280
On the back it's written 'Tito'.

703
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:29,240
The big sucess of 'Battle of Neretva'
convinced Tito,

704
01:18:29,399 --> 01:18:32,360
to alllow,
that his character appear on film.

705
01:18:35,199 --> 01:18:38,120
The question arrised
who will be the actor.

706
01:19:06,439 --> 01:19:08,400
Tito choosed.

707
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:11,840
It is known that director
chooses the actors.

708
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,880
But, as Tito was alive,

709
01:19:16,359 --> 01:19:19,280
it was normal
that he will choose.

710
01:19:26,439 --> 01:19:30,120
Richard Burton met Tito
before the start of shooting.

711
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:33,000
Many times they hung out together.

712
01:19:33,279 --> 01:19:39,200
He had his concepion,
of course, agreeing with Tito.

713
01:19:45,119 --> 01:19:49,080
President Josip Broz Tito and
his wife Jovanka

714
01:19:49,279 --> 01:19:52,920
on Brioni recepted famous film-stars.
Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton.

715
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:58,400
Burton was Tito
in the new super-spectacle "Sutjeska".

716
01:20:18,319 --> 01:20:22,240
It's important to,
that Tito was wounded on Sutjeska.

717
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:28,160
If the wound has been
deadly,

718
01:20:28,319 --> 01:20:31,280
it could have changed the
whole history.

719
01:20:31,479 --> 01:20:35,400
It's one of the most important
moments in his life,

720
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:38,080
so he watched it very carefully.

721
01:20:38,279 --> 01:20:44,120
He was reading the scenario, going through material
he gave his opinion.

722
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:47,720
Comrade Tito,
the British mission came.

723
01:20:59,359 --> 01:21:01,600
Message for Tito.
- Should I carry it?

724
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,520
I don't trust them.

725
01:21:28,079 --> 01:21:30,400
I don't trust them too.

726
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:40,560
You're good.

727
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:13,240
From the conversation of president Tito
and the crew of the film 'Sutjeska'.

728
01:22:14,359 --> 01:22:16,360
Stane Dolanc:

729
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:21,280
That scene when the president Tito,
is injured, I think something is missing.

730
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:25,680
Nobody came to Comrade Tito.

731
01:22:26,439 --> 01:22:29,120
Tito: Nobody came...

732
01:22:29,319 --> 01:22:33,000
I was going after to see if
you are alive or not.

733
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:36,760
That is right. No one came to me.

734
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:43,880
Dolanc: I agree Comrade Tito, that's
what you know and a few more people.

735
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:49,520
Although, the world wants to know
how nobody approaches Tito now.

736
01:22:50,159 --> 01:22:52,120
People don't know.

737
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:55,720
Tito says, nothing is changing.

738
01:23:14,039 --> 01:23:17,200
So you are pleased with today's work?

739
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:21,720
We shouldn't make something so powerful.
- No, it is good.

740
01:23:32,479 --> 01:23:34,400
Attack!

741
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:05,680
The winner of the 20th joubilar festival
is the film "Sutjeska" from director Stipe Delic.

742
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:09,240
The audience that is
always faithfull to the festival,

743
01:24:09,399 --> 01:24:11,800
warmly greeted the actors.

744
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:17,440
I declare Comrade Tito

745
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:22,600
for the president without a limit of
a mandate.

746
01:24:23,079 --> 01:24:26,080
Declaration of Tito as the life-long president, 1974

747
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:39,400
Tito and Yugoslavia
as the symbol of sucess.

748
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:42,800
Wherever you go there was
hospitality.

749
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,840
We enjoyed a big
respect in the world.

750
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:16,480
I met Tito when he was
visiting America.

751
01:25:17,439 --> 01:25:20,720
Hollywood stars made a reception
in honour to Tito, 1974

752
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:25,000
He asked me, are we going to talk
serbian or serbo-croatian.

753
01:25:25,159 --> 01:25:28,000
I said how would you like.
- Serbo-Croatian!

754
01:25:28,199 --> 01:25:30,920
He said, you speak terrific language,

755
01:25:31,079 --> 01:25:34,640
where were you born?.
"In Yugoslavia" I said.

756
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:37,760
"I was born there but I came here in 1952"
- "So, you escaped?"

757
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,800
"Of course that I escaped"
- "I would do the same"

758
01:26:08,319 --> 01:26:12,360
I came to Yugoslavia in 1975,

759
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:17,560
it was a great life here. Great.

760
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:22,000
I couldn't believe that you suceeded
in Comunism.

761
01:26:23,279 --> 01:26:26,200
Children were going to the seaside,
to the mountains,

762
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:29,880
Healthcare and education
were completely free.

763
01:26:30,159 --> 01:26:32,800
I couldn't believe how it
was free.

764
01:26:35,079 --> 01:26:38,040
That sucess was not real.

765
01:26:38,399 --> 01:26:42,320
But we must pay now, because
we took loans. I don't know.

766
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:45,200
"To know all - No problem"

767
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:50,720
It is an expression which means
that everything is in the best order,

768
01:26:51,119 --> 01:26:53,520
and that is why we wont
talk about it anymore.

769
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:56,760
It was not allowed to
talk about some things,

770
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:59,760
especially against the
president.

771
01:27:00,039 --> 01:27:02,880
If this country is in a depression, I must throw it away.

772
01:27:04,399 --> 01:27:07,560
Film people were scared,

773
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:11,160
if they write or record something,

774
01:27:11,479 --> 01:27:14,160
that they will be declared
as state enemies.

775
01:27:14,319 --> 01:27:20,600
My thesis then was:
Socialism as an idea is good,

776
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:24,760
but the people wrongfully
implement it.

777
01:27:25,039 --> 01:27:28,080
Art must criticize.

778
01:27:28,439 --> 01:27:33,480
When we talk now about Tito's time,

779
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:36,600
I can say that some wrong things
were done.

780
01:27:37,079 --> 01:27:40,680
And my career ended like that.

781
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:44,080
Branko Pesic,
was my good friend...

782
01:27:44,279 --> 01:27:47,840
He called me In 1972 and said
that somebody is going to kill me,

783
01:27:48,119 --> 01:27:52,960
that I really messed up.
"Resign and escape as soon as possible. "

784
01:27:55,600 --> 01:28:01,520
Other people came to Avala film,
that weren't risking with politics.

785
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:03,880
Comrade Director?

786
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:12,600
There were many hard decisions,

787
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:16,120
that couldn't live in the free world.

788
01:28:16,439 --> 01:28:19,000
But there were also easy ones,

789
01:28:19,199 --> 01:28:24,440
that people remember as a happy situation.
Rights,

790
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:28,360
that they willl never have.
And never will have in the capitalism.

791
01:28:59,319 --> 01:29:02,320
I played the last movie.

792
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:08,440
He layed there. I was behind,
mounting the projector.

793
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:14,880
All the time he holded his leg.

794
01:29:16,359 --> 01:29:19,400
I thought that he will not see the end.

795
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:24,080
He said: "Leka, stop it,
my leg hurts too much. "

796
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,800
The doctors came.

797
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,720
And they've took him to Ljubljana.
That was the last time I saw him.

798
01:29:39,359 --> 01:29:43,040
"Tito's funeral, 8. May 1980".

799
01:29:43,319 --> 01:29:46,560
News:
"Tito died, the idea lives. "

800
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:51,040
"Boundless sorrow in our hearts"

801
01:29:51,279 --> 01:29:54,840
Politika: "Yesterday at the clinique in Ljubljana... "

802
01:29:55,680 --> 01:30:01,800
I went to Tito's funeral 350km by walk.

803
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:07,480
He was a wise man.

804
01:30:09,399 --> 01:30:11,840
He was lying a lot,

805
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:14,640
but we loved him.

806
01:30:43,319 --> 01:30:48,040
4. May, 1980 at 15.05
Sirens denote the time of Tito's death.

807
01:30:55,359 --> 01:31:00,680
I was in jury in the Cannes festival
when I heard the news that Tito is dead.

808
01:31:02,239 --> 01:31:05,680
Everyone asked,
what will be with Yugoslavia after Tito.

809
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:10,360
It was considered that he is
keeping an eye for it.

810
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:59,600
Preparations for the 38. film festival
in Pula, that will be held

811
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:04,800
from 26. July to 2. August,
are going faster these days.

812
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,800
It would be a great pleasure,
that Europe,

813
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,720
that know us better now for
our multi-nacional conflicts,

814
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:15,360
remember us for
well-organized film festival.

815
01:32:36,039 --> 01:32:41,200
No one even dreamed that
everything will suddenly collapse.

816
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:46,920
But it is true that our
house was mined.

817
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:56,160
Pula, 26. July 1991

818
01:32:56,319 --> 01:33:00,680
We cancel this festival, simly as a call to

819
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:04,400
people of culture to stand up against
the violence,

820
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:07,360
that is in every pore of our life.

821
01:33:16,199 --> 01:33:19,720
That summer
the war in Yugoslavia started.

822
01:34:13,399 --> 01:34:16,760
What is going on now with your theory
of revolution interests?

823
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:27,160
Revolution will pass,

824
01:34:27,359 --> 01:34:29,560
and also the memories of this time.

825
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:32,320
You're victim will be hard,

826
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:34,920
but quickly forgotten.

827
01:34:35,479 --> 01:34:39,960
That revolution, that you carry in yourself
will die here with us, forgotten.

828
01:34:49,159 --> 01:34:53,280
Unfortunately we conclude
this sad story.

829
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:59,840
I don't want to be pathetic, to say that
I want to cry

830
01:35:00,039 --> 01:35:03,360
when I see Avala
as some lame trash.

831
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:06,920
Before, it looked as a roman park.

832
01:35:43,479 --> 01:35:47,640
Picture of Yugoslavia,
about the life in it,

833
01:35:48,119 --> 01:35:51,080
about the country itself

834
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:55,880
is more and more unclear since it's
decay.

835
01:35:56,880 --> 01:36:01,240
I think that it will end up in a fog
and a total ignorance of what it was,

836
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:06,560
which will either be denied
or over-glorified,

837
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:09,520
as a land of immense happiness.

838
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:44,320
Scenario and direction

839
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:04,280
Listen! They think,
that the partisans are destroyed.

840
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:09,160
Wait.
We will now see

841
01:41:09,359 --> 01:41:12,200
then we'll talk
and laugh to tears.

842
01:41:12,359 --> 01:41:15,080
Begin there.
- You, up there, spin it!

843
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:21,160
CINEMA KOMUNISTO

844
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,116
