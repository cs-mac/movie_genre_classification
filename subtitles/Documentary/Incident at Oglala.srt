Answer the phone.

10
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,950
Why did you call?

11
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,920
There's no way you're already here.

12
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,480
I was just curious about what you were doing.

13
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,720
What were you doing?

14
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,970
I was debating whether to go out or not.

15
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,230
I don't think so. 
 I think you're putting make up on.

16
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,620
What do you mean by make up?

17
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,070
I haven't decided yet if I'll go camping or not.

18
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,920
Oh yes! Your brother, what kind of person is he?

19
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,720
I hear he was a detective.

20
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,490
Why my brother, all of a sudden?

21
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,870
Just because.

22
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,880
So later, if I happen to meet your brother,

23
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,250
I was curious if your brother would like me.

24
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,270
Well, the guys his little sister will meet

25
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,770
will be thieves and bad guys,

26
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,730
and he will treat them as criminals,

27
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,850
so avoiding him will be your best solution.

28
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,540

Hey.

Take these cucumbers and tomatoes.

57

Ah, I put them on or off depending on how I feel.

58
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,220

I am going to fire my lawyer.

101
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:07,330
Then as a new lawyer,

102
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:11,410
I am going to appoint Attorney Koo Jae In.

103
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,130

Ah... I...

106
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,500
Soo Yeong! Where is Soo Yeong, Dad?

107
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,190
Huh? She went camping with her friends.
 She'll be back tomorrow.

108
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:54,850
Oh!

109
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:57,910
What's wrong? What about Soo Yeong?

110
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,130
Why is your expression heavy like lead?

What's going on?

112
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,780
Oh...

113
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:09,100
It's nothing. We were going to meet and the punk stood me up.

114
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,720
Then, she was supposed to meet you

115
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,700
but went camping instead?

116
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,020
Seems like it.

117
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,010
She may still be mad at me.

118
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,310
That kid...

119
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:33,810
To maintain a marriage, both the husband and wife

120
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,370
have to put in effort and make sacrifices.

121
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,660
The Plaintiff, Yoon Hwa Yeong, claims that she has made
 endless sacrifices during her marriage, but

122
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,680
what exactly did you sacrifice?

123
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,000
When your biological son got kidnapped, to ensure inheritance of the estate,

124
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,110
you took an innocent orphan.

125
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,110
You lied that he was your biological son, and you put him in his place. 
Is this what you call "sacrifice"?

126
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:58,030
Or, was planning with your son's kidnapper,

127
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:01,040
and turning your back on the husband 
whom you lived with for 30 years,

128
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,710
using the press conference as a violent and malicious method

129
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:07,090
to expose him to the world.
 Is this what you call "sacrifice"?

130
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,170
Did you even once during the 30 years,

131
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,150
with sincerity,

132
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,440
with love,

133
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,020
think of your husband as your husband?

134
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,410
Without doing anything, without putting in any effort,

135
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,860
you always just looked blankly at the far away mountains.

136
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,920
Yet, you claim that the fault for divorce lies entirely with the Defendant.

137
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,190
The Plaintiff is being ridiculously arrogant and selfish to make such a claim.

138
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,560
I'll ask you again.

139
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,100
Plaintiff, for the past 30 years,

140
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,190
what did you do?

141
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,880
Was it sacrifice?

142
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,470
Or was it revenge?

143
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,340
Plaintiff, please answer.

144
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,170
Before the Defendant, Jang Tae Ha, got married,

145
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,230
he already had a woman, and

146
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,720
he even had a child.

147
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,520
He maintained this relationship with them for 30 years.

148
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,890
According to Civil Law...

149
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,400
Chapter 840, Section 1,

150
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,910
a marriage partner's cheating...

151
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:25,300
can be considered as a grave reason for divorce, Judge.

152
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:30,410
Isn't that child legally your daughter?

153
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:33,320
According to the paperwork, she had been legally 
added to your family record in 1992.

154
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,700
According to Civil Law, Chapter 840, Section 2,

155
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,750
after 6 months of discovering or forgiving the partner's cheating,

156
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,280
or after 2 years since the date of cheating,

157
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,430
a suit for divorce cannot be filed.

158
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,160
Don't you know this?

159
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,790
If so,

160
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,010
then let's discuss Civil Law, Chapter 840, Section 3,

161
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:54,990
which outlines the mistreatment of marriage partners.

162
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57,390
The Defendant, Jang Tae Ha,

163
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:01,090
gave me medication for schizophrenia, and he faked a doctor's diagnosis

164
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,680
to make me a legally incompetent person.

165
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,160
Thanks to him, I lost my legal license.

166
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,890
That's an outrageous claim made by the Plaintiff,
 and there is no proof of it, Your Honor.

167
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,050
Then, I'll begin proving it, now.

168
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,540
Instead of the witness who failed to appear today,

169
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,750
in place of Dr. Kim Seong Hoon,

170
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,990
I request to bring a new witness, whom the Defendant, Jang Tae Ha has been maintaining an affair with for 30 years.

171
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,020
I request to bring Ms. Go Seok Bong as a new witness.

172
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,330
W- who? Go Seok... Bong?

173
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,870
Hey, did you find them?

174
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,930
<i>Soo Yeong's phone has been turned off, and Kim Joong Yeop's current location...</i>

175
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,500
<i>looks like he is moving from Paldang and heading in the direction of Yangpyeong.</i>

176
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,140
That means he's headed somewhere near Yangpyeong or Namyangju.

177
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,090
Call the car rental companies in Seoul, and find out what car
 was rented by a Kim Joong Yeop born in 1981.

178
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,980
Put out an arrest warrant with the rental car's make and model, 
and keep me updated on his location.

179
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:25,560
<i>Sunbaenim, you know that if I get caught doing this, I'll be suspended, right?</i>

180
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,830
<i>Jang Tae Ha is trying to kill me.</i>

181
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,500
<i>Please help me.</i>

182
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,100
<i>Please help me.</i>

183
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,850
<i>Please get me out of here.</i>

184
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,790
<i>Jang Tae Ha...</i>

185
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,220
<i>Jang Tae Ha is trying to kill me.</i>

186
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,560
<i>Please help me.</i>

187
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,410
At that time, how was my condition?

188
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,810
Frankly, you were a crazy person...

189
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,440
You were a crazy woman.

190
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,010
You were a woman whose consciousness was paralyzed... I mean,

191
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,100
your arms and legs were paralyzed, so you couldn't stand,

192
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,250
and you were crawling on the floor.

193
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,540
I have an objection, Your Honor.

194
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,780
The Witness is not a medical doctor.

195
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:26,130
Also, when you look at the video, there is no proof 
that the Defendant drugged the Plaintiff.

196
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,310
It can't be considered as direct evidence.

197
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:32,690
That video could have been falsely produced by the
 Plaintiff and the Witness, under conspiracy.

198
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,950
Taking such a recording and holding onto it is proof of that! 
What else could it be?

199
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,380
Hey!

200
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,200
The conspiracy was between you and me! 
Between you and me!

201
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,210
What conspiracy would I have created with Yoon Hwa Yeong?

202
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,920
Do you know why I'm here? 
I'm here, thanks to <i>you</i>!

203
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,260
Witness, please calm down.

204
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,360
Okay.

205
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,760
I will try to solidify the evidence in a few moments.

206
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,740
I will call forth the husband and wife custodians and ask them further questions.

207
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:58,610
In the list of witnesses, only the husband's name is on there.

208
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:04,340
However, the wife who was forced, under unfortunate circumstances, to drug me...

209
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:08,140
She is here at this court, in place of her husband.

210
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,540
Ms. Go Seok Bong.

211
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,510
Please call me Go Joo Ran.

212
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,680
Okay.

213
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,470
Ms. Go Joo Ran. 
- Yes?

214
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:35,950
The world calls us as the wife and mistress.

215
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,790
It may be hard to believe, but for 30 years

216
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:44,540
we have lived that way, at times together, at times separately.

217
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,750
You, the Witness...

218
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,770
Why didn't you leave the Defendant, Jang Tae Ha?

219
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:55,040
Did you love the Defendant so much... that you 
were willing to endure this situation for 30 years?

220
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,970
It wasn't because of Jang Tae Ha.

221
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,750
It was because I loved my daughter.

222
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,290
It was because I loved Jang Tae Ha's <i>money</i>, not Jang Tae Ha.

223
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:13,730
I wanted my daughter to inherit Jang Tae Ha's money.

224
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:16,370
If he didn't have money-
- I would have left him already.

225
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,820
I would have left him 30 years ago.

226
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:24,740
He has the personality of a dog, is self-centered,

227
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:29,320
and he is worth nothing as a man, nothing as a person. 
Also, as a husband...

228
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,340
and as a father, he is worth zilch, nothing!

229
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:37,830
If he didn't have money, why would I stay by a man like him?

230
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,550
Ms. Yoon Hwa Yeong, you're still by his side because of the money, too.

231
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,010
Does Jang Tae Ha have anyone by his side who's not there for the money?

232
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,020
Everyone is gathered around him, because of his money.

233
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,720
Because he knows that, he tries so hard to grip onto his money, and

234
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,650
he tries hard not to have his money stolen from him.

235
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,020
I'm just like them.

236
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,280
To get back my father's inheritance that Jang Tae Ha stole...

237
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,430
To get it back and to give it to my son...

238
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,880
I have endured (this marriage) for 30 years.

239
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,960
If I endure this for 5 more years...

240
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,690
If I endure this for 10 more years, then...

241
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,810
there is a possibility that my son could inherit the Defendant's estate.

242
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,710
My son might one day inherit all of his estate.

243
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,620
However, now...

244
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,940
I am unable to endure any more, 
not even one more day, Your Honor.

245
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,980
For me to endure further...

246
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,500
Today,

247
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:40,030
tomorrow, and...

248
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,990
every day has become too valuable to me.

249
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,500
As of now, I want to live everyday to the fullest.

250
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,780
Divorce...

251
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:54,180
Please allow it, Your Honor.

252
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:58,520
I feel sorry for the times that have wasted by...

253
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,060
I'll be sure to live my life to the fullest.

254
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,410
I'll give myself another chance at living again.

255
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,510
Dad gave this for us to eat.

256
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:34,560
He planted this himself. He said it tastes as good as honey.

257
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,160
Then, should we peel some honey and try it?

258
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:52,160
Why do you have a knife in your back pocket?

259
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,150
When you come to place like this, a knife has many uses.

260
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,400
Wow, it's really like honey! 
- Right?

261
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,320
It's definitely different from the ones you purchase, right?

262
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:18,660
Here, should we grill the meat now?

263
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,080
Let's do that.

264
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:27,890
Mr. Driver! Why do you drive like that?!

265
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:31,110
Oh, Sunbaenim!

266
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:33,030
W- why did you drive a taxi?

267
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,050
Are you sure this is the place?

268
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,330
We traced his movements from Namyangju, and he ended up here. 
Kim Joong Yeop's current location is found to be at...

269
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:41,860
Yongin-si, Cheoin-gu, Baekam-myeon, Yongcheon-ri, 778-15.

270
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,590
Even if we take into consideration an error in radius of 1.5 Kilometers, this place...

271
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,260
I'm sure that this camping site is the right place.

272
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,860
Does he have any record of past offenses?

273
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:53,040
He was arrested for murder, but due to insufficient evidence, 
he was determined to be innocent.

274
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,340
At the age of 16, he already had a past offense in 3rd degree burglary.
 After the age of 20,

275
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,730
he had a record of fraud and assault.

276
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,400
Let's go.

277
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,260
We must find Soo Yeong.

278
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,860
Woo Cheol, we need to find Soo Yeong.

279
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,950
We'll find her. Really.

280
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,790
Be careful. He knows how to use a knife.

281
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,620
How's the wine?

282
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,310
I don't really know.

283
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:45,800
I just think that wine tastes like wine.

284
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,390
I've only drank so-mec (soju+beer) and makgeolli (Korean wheat/rice wine).

285
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,790
I haven't had much exposure to wine.

286
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:58,190
It's the wine that Earnest Hemingway,
 the author of "The Old Man and the Sea" and "Resurrection", loved.

287
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:01,570
He even named his granddaughter Margaux,
 (after the wine, Chateau Margaux)

288
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,620
so that tells you how much he loved wine.

289
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:07,490
But "Resurrection" was written by Tolstoy, the old man who's famous for his quotes.

290
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:12,420
"Like the fruit that comes from a seed, 
actions come from thoughts."

291
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:15,730
"Everyone thinks of changing the world, but..."

292
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:18,910
"no one thinks of changing himself."

293
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:24,560
"He who loves is alive."

294
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:29,540
I don't know why I wrote and memorized these things.

295
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,750
I'm sorry.

296
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,090
Just a moment, Joong Yeop.

297
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:13,030
How about we just listen to some music?

298
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:55,330
Are you all that great?

299
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:59,700
Is your dad, your brother... all that great?

300
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,960
What are you saying?

301
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,450
Do I look funny to you?

302
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,400
Oppa! Oppa!

303
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,180
Oppa, what are you doing?

304
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,440
Oppa!

305
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,360
J- Joong Yeop...

306
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,070
Sunbaenim, that's enough!

307
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,010
Let me go, let me go!

308
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,430
That's enough!

309
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:12,000
Sunbaenim, that's enough.

310
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,760
Cuff him. 
- What?

311
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,950
Even so, handcuffs seem like too much.

312
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:29,630
This guy is the person who murdered Chief Song Jae Moon.

313
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,230
What?

314
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:32,810
A murderer?

315
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,290
Cuff him, quickly!

316
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,430
Okay.

317
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:57,330
Before you hand me to the police, how about you call your father?

318
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:59,580
I was following the Chairman's orders.

319
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,630
Song Jae Moon, and even your younger sister!

320
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:05,000
It wasn't my idea. It was your father's!

321
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,010
I'm not like Kang Ho hyung-nim. I'm not going to take the blame alone.

322
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,300
Fine.

323
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:16,270
But now that I think about it,

324
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:19,330
I have one more thing left to do.

325
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:34,040
I need to pay my respects to Chief Song Jae Moon.

326
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,830
Hand this over to the evidence team.

327
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,450
Okay.

328
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,120
Take him in.

329
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,160
Yes.

330
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:35,440
You didn't make any mistakes, and...

331
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,980
you didn't do anything wrong.

332
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,350
It's not your fault.

333
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,800
I'm sorry.

334
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:52,010
I'm really sorry, Soo Yeong.

335
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,630
I'm sorry.

336
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,950
It's okay.

337
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,020
It's okay, Soo Yeong.

338
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,120
It's okay.

339
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:31,480
It's okay, it's okay.

340
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:36,600
It's okay, it's okay.

341

It was nothing.

363
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:53,450
I heard that District Attorney Seo sent out a subpoena to you as well.

364
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,740
You're going in tomorrow, right?

365

Yes.

366
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:00,910
He says that all the police records have been destroyed, 
and that there isn't even a trace of evidence.

367
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:04,650
Ah Mi said that you might have the investigation records, and...

368
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:06,530
she said that you did a re-investigation on your own.

<i>you might have the investigation records.</i>

371
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,500
I have them.

372
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,970
Eun Joong,

373
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:20,570
turn them in tomorrow. Be sure to turn them in.

374
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:26,780
I'm in front of the house. I was going to leave, but I'll come in.

00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:55,590
Ha Soo Yeong.

376

If you're not going to get out, I'm going to carry you out.

378
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,840
did things go wrong? Oppa.

379
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,770
Was it started from my father?

380
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:17,490
Or was it started from your father?

381
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,550

00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,650
They said, it depends on how you practice.

385
00:32:54,680 --> 00:33:00,180

386
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,780

388
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,280
Yellow butterfly.

390
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,680

391
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,570

392
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:17,830
Wow. Genius. Genius!

393
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,320
It hurts.

394
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,580
Kids came.

395
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,460
Ah.

396
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,350
What happened? Why is your hand injured?

397
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,700
Guitar was yours?

398
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,540
Yeah. Ah Mi said to learn so..

399
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,980
You said you're coming back tomorrow.

400
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,120
What happened?

401
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,410
Your clothes are a mess, and the wounds on your hand.

402
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:00,650
Soo Yeong seemed abstracted. What happened?

403
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:02,840
Why is it like this?

404
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,270
I'll do it for you.

405
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:36,070
He's a murderer.

406
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:41,420
- Yeah. 
 - Jang Tae Ha.

407
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:44,040
That person ordered him to do it.

408
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,320
From your Oppa..

409
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,510
I heard.

410
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:53,270
Without knowing that, I...

411
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,790
If Oppa didn't come, I...

412
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,940
Today, I...

413
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,610
It will pass.

414
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,250
Everything will pass.

415
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,830
Let's believe it like that, Soo Yeong.

416
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:11,120
What should we do about Oppa?

417
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:16,440
Ah Mi, Oppa apologized to me.

418
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:21,110
He said, he's sorry. He's really sorry.

419
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:24,440
That stupid person is apologizing to me, Ah Mi.

420
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:35,990
He'll probably live his whole life apologizing to me, right?

421
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:39,810
Everyday, he'll probably live with guilt, right?

422
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,870
Instead of that person Jang Tae Ha,

423
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:45,850
he'll live by saying sorry to other people.

424
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:51,020
Do you think there's a way to save Oppa, Ah Mi?

425
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,330
My Oppa's shackles..

426
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:57,130
Is there really no way to release him from that, Ah Mi?

427
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:04,210
If we want to end this,

428
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:06,690
if we don't want to repeat the same things over again,

429
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:09,150
if we don't want to commit any more sins,

430
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:12,060
we have no choice but to put your father in jail.

431
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,510
He's not a person who could change.

432
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:18,440
He thinks of himself as at the same level of a Joseon Dynasty King.

433
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:23,110
He thinks that he is the law and he is the Republic of Korea.

434
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:26,850
This might be too cruel for you,

435
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:30,230
but we have to make your father be punished.

436
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:34,820
Investigation record.. and testify to everything that you know.

437
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:38,000
Including what happened today.

438
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,190
If not,

439
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:43,720
Soo Yeong and Ah Mi will continue to be in danger.

440
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:01,280
Okay, all done.

441
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,280
Is this the only one you want opened?

442
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,370
Yes. I only locked there, but I lost my key so...

443
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:08,950
Oh, how much is it?

444
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,860

Father's performance was shocking, but

453
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:17,630
Ah Mi's singing was even more shocking.

491
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:45,680
What are you doing?

492
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:52,570
I'm trying to burn up Detective Ha Eun Joong's 
investigation records from the Jongro station.

493
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:54,090
What?

494
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,480
Did you get permission?

495
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:03,000
Permission? Whose permission?

496
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,620
Father's permission?

497
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:08,300
If not, Ha Eun Joong's permission?

498
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:15,040
I suppose. It's not like you got permission
 to burn up Eun Joong's vehicle either.

499
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:19,740
It was your mother who did it, for your sake.

500
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:23,970
It was you who conspired together, instigating the incident using shares as the bait.

501
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:27,350
Right! For your sake.

502
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:30,810
To make you the heir.

503
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:32,960
For my sake?

504
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:37,550
Did you really do it for my sake?

505
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:42,460
Then, I'll admit that it was for the two of us.

506
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:45,630
Yes, it's for both of us.

507
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:48,190
Let's not fight, Noona.

508
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:51,400
If we want to protect Father and the Group,

509
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,560
then we must gather our forces.

510
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:56,270
We have to stick tightly together and block Ha Eun Joong.

511
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:59,380
So what if we stick "tightly" together and block Ha Eun Joong,

512
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,460
then what?

513
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:05,890
Then will you strike against me?

514
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:09,010
What does that mean? How could I do that to you?

515
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:12,780
The you that I knew was a kid who couldn't do things like this.

516
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:18,280
The you that I knew was a kid who memorized 
law books and lived within the law.

517
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:21,860
Upright like Mother, straight like Mother.

518
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:26,340
The one who wanted to emulate Father was me.

519
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:29,700
It's true.

520
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,360
Then,

521
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,320
why are you being this way?

522
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:36,080
Why are you being this way as well?

523
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,770
Are you really trying to become like Father?

524
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:43,020
Are you being this way because you really want to become like Father?

525
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:46,050
How can you go as far as to hurt someone...

526
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:51,190
You should have dissuaded them. You should have said they couldn't.

527
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:53,140
What were you going to do if he actually died?

528
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:57,170
What were you going to do if Eun Joong actually died there?

529
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:03,540
<i>Jang Tae Ha</i>

530
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:15,530
I am more afraid of you than our father.

531
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:20,490
When I look at you, it feels like I'm looking at myself.

532
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:24,150
Like I'm looking at myself becoming hideously similar to someone.

533
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:29,040
I feel you're horrible and scary because I feel I'm looking at myself.

534
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:34,360
Jae In, let's not cross that final line.

535
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:39,320
Let's not do things that we shouldn't do, please, Jae In?

536
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:48,120
Jae In.

537
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:57,840
Then I guess you can exclude yourself from this race.

538
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:04,260
Okay. You take yourself out. As for me, even if 
I may become more horrid,

539
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:07,430
and become more hideous,

540
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:14,060
I want to protect my position, my life, and myself!

541
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:17,650
I don't want to lose it to him again.

542
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:23,090
Can you only think of having lost your position,
but not as having taken his position?

543
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:23,700
Wh-what?

544
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:29,080
From Eun Joong's perspective, you have taken his position
and his life away from him.

545
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:33,730
You have lived enjoying all things he should have enjoyed.

546
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:39,150
For you it's only been mere few months,
but for him, he's lost his rights to you for 25 years.

547
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:40,930
Calculate it properly.

548
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:45,280
Stop acting the victim now, I'm saying!

549
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:10,340
Aren't you curious about what I'm burning?

550
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:31,320
I'm telling you because you don't seem to know very well,
 but you can't win against Father.

551
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:35,700
Never, and no one can win against him.

552
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:40,030
Either adjust to him or leave are the only two options.

553
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:45,070
That's why Mom left in the end.

554
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:51,020
I will take you to the Prosecutor's Office tomorrow.

555
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:54,470
Because I think tomorrow will be a long day.

556
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:57,140
Let's get some sleep.

557
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:15,020
Don't go tomorrow morning.

558
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:16,650
I can't do that.

559
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:19,100
I will be there tomorrow.

560
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:26,170
Even if the record of investigation disappears, and
Shin Gang Ho and Kim Joon Hyeok perjure themselves,

561
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:29,970
you won't be able to escape this time, Father.

562
00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:34,100
You will have to pay for your crime, for sure.

563
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:40,910
That's a far-fetched story.

564
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:46,900
You can't win against me. It's not possible.

565
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:49,340
I've battled a lot.

566
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:52,970
And I have never lost.

567
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:57,330
This time you will lose.

568
00:50:57,330 --> 00:51:00,910
Because you are fighting

569
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:03,520
me and not the law.

570
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:07,960
You will be fighting against your son.

571
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:11,880
Sleep well.

572
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:47,150
<i>"Wake up Tae Ha Construction, the vampire who takes off
with people's traveling expense to the next life."</i>

573
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:49,530
Four City is conning innocent locals.

574
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:53,810
You must leave us!

575
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:57,780
"Wake up Taeha Construction, the vampire who takes off,

576
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:02,240
with people's traveling expense to the next life!"

577
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,660
You say you will connect

578
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:08,250
Munyoo, Jecheong, Gooyi, Yoong islands,

579
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:14,050
to build culture and welfare center? Even dogs would laugh!

580
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:17,930
Four City be gone!

581
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:24,680
It's still at the beginning stage. If it gets more "ripe"
I'll brief you.

582
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,740
You said you'd put Construction on diet. (cut down on
excess investment or programs not necessary to core business)

583
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:30,460
You said you'd ensure internal stability by managing its weight (cut down on excess).

584
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:34,480
When I look at other groups collapsing overnight,
it reminds me that that could happen to us as well.

585
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:39,120
Business wise, we have reviewed the land development thoroughly,

586
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:43,390
and putting it roughly, if we don't think it will pan out, we can just pull out.

587
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,010
Did we lay a bridge across an ocean or build a structure above land?

588
00:52:47,050 --> 00:52:48,630
We only purchased a boatload of land is all.

589
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:51,010
The fact that a "boatload" of land was purchased
means that Taeha Construction's funding...

590
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:54,610
That land price has skyrocketed.

591
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:57,220
I'm earning money at the moment, Jang Joo Ha.

592
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:08,420
Aren't you going to go to work? Why do you keep coming
around when you must be busy?

593
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:12,680
I'm appearing in court to answer the summons from the Prosecution,

594
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:18,470
and was wondering whether I should hand this over as well.

595
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:21,580
That's what I came here to tell you about.

596
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:25,240
Would you tell what you know if the Prosecution were to contact you?

597
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,990
Even if you hand it over, the Prosecution won't be able to touch (him).

598
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:31,080
Rather, the prosecutor who touches the case would be fired.

599
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:34,290
You know that's happened numerous times.

600
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:36,550
Still, I can't just let it go.

601
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:39,260
Stuff like that is meant to be held on to.

602
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:43,560
To use as insurance or as blackmail. Especially,

603
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,300
when you have something to achieve, even more so.

604
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:50,820
What's the scale of Taeha Group's slush fund?

605
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:53,690
I'm asking approximately how much money is contained here?

606
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:56,690
I'd say it's about $6 billion. Why?

607
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:02,140
So that you can wipe out the account again?

608
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:05,350
I mean,

609
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,990
really, for real, you're going to steal it?

610
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:13,000
Just what are you going to do with all that money that you'd...

611
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,100
Should we steal it together?

612
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:26,980
Let's do that. Let's steal it together.

613
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:29,490
To celebrate having been born again on the same date. 
(surviving the car explosion)

614
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:36,110
You said, let's live properly, right? 
 I'm sure you're stealing to live properly, no?

615
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:39,720
Hell with it. Let's just do that.

616
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:46,100
Ah, so what are you going to do after stealing your father's slush fund?

617
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,920
So that I can have people buy up Taeha Group's stock.

618
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,530
You mean, you yourself won't be buying, but

619
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:55,800
letting other people buy up Taeha stock?

620
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:59,890
So in a word, though you don't have any intent to become
the majority share holder,

621
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:02,480
but you will secure friendly investors. 
 (More people own shares more accountable Taeha Gp becomes to public).

622
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,090
That's right.

623
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:10,020
Ah, by the way, why are you appearing at the Prosecutor's Office?

624
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:15,010
Did District Prosecutor Seo Joon Hyeong summon you, perhaps?

625
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:15,580
Yes.

626
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:18,070
I was told to make a plot so that he'd be forced to resign

627
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:21,930
over blocking a tax withholding investigation.

628
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:23,650
I finished the plot already.

629
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:27,510
What did you do? Create a plot?

630
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:29,480
As to make him resign?

631
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:35,170
<i>All we need is a believable picture as we can manufacture
any story that goes with it.</i>

632
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:40,300
<i>Whether it is true or false, once it becomes a controversy,
then he has to resign regardless.</i>

633
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:43,260
<i>It'd be piece of cake.</i>

634
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:47,170
I bet he will make a deal using the threat of releasing
the picture to the press.

635
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:49,200
It's a big trouble if it's true,

636
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:53,390
and even if it weren't true, there's no way to prove it
otherwise so he'll be in quite a fix.

637
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:57,070
He can do nothing but give up on this game.

638
00:55:57,070 --> 00:56:01,100
I know it'd be difficult for you, but please come with me
to the outside of the hospital.

639
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:04,150
What? Go out of the hospital?

640
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,320
What is it?

641
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:13,790
<i>Chairman, there's a person named Ha Myeong Geun,</i>

642
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:17,970
<i>insisting on seeing you and waiting for you stubbornly at the lobby.</i>

643
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:20,310
<i>He said that if you were told his name, you'd certainly meet with him.</i>

644
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:22,470
<i>What should I do?</i>

645
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:28,950
Tell them to send him up.

646
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:30,630
<i>Yes, Chairman.</i>

647
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:36,490
<i>Father.</i>

648
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,780
<i>I'd like to hold on to time.</i>

649
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,440
<i>The last time</i>

650
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:47,450
<i>with you, Father.</i>

651
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:13,970
I was hoping for the punk I handled and

652
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:18,740
your wench of a daughter to have a happy ending,
it's too bad.

653
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:25,060
A murderer boyfriend to an abductor's daughter.

654
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:28,610
It's a well suited pair, don't you think?

655
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:33,930
As a last parting gift, I was hoping to

656
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:36,460
hold that thug and your daughter's hands

657
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:41,590
and wail refreshingly at your funeral.

658
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:45,350
Well, it's regrettable but you're someone about to depart
this world soon,

659
00:57:45,350 --> 00:57:48,480
and your wench of a daughter will continue to live on,

660
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:52,730
so I can take my time and slowly consider it.

661
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:54,610
Don't you think?

662
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,130
I'm sorry.

663
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:13,680
I've been wrong, Jang Tae Ha.

664
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:19,630
I did wrong. Taking Eun Joong from you,

665
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:24,290
for having taken him away from you for 25 years,

666
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:28,330
I was wrong.

667
00:58:28,330 --> 00:58:31,730
What would appease you? What can I do to make it up?

668
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,810
Jang Tae Ha. I will do everything. I will do everything you say.

669
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:39,060
I will do whatever you want, as much as I can do.

670
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:41,870
Tell me what you want.

671
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:44,220
I will do it.

672
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,050
Tell only to me.

673
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:52,370
I beg you to just tell me.

674
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:56,960
Don't do that to my Soo Yeong. That bastard can't be the one.

675
00:58:56,980 --> 00:59:00,830
Please just leave her be. I beg you.

676
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:02,870
I will beg like this, okay?

677
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:08,500
I beg you. I did wrong.

678
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:10,190
I did wrong, Jang Tae Ha.

679
00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:12,720
Cut the crap!

680
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:16,100
Don't make an apology not in your heart.

681
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:20,040
You did wrong? Now you talk of wrongdoing?

682
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:23,870
When my cub is thinking you are the father!

683
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:28,080
You, not me, as the father.

684
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:31,560
He still thinks of the abductor as the father.

685
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:36,990
How is it so simple to you, to just mention your wrongdoing? WHAT?!

686
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:40,340
How come it's so easy for you?

687
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:43,710
How come it's so simple?

688
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:46,820
I... I... I!!!!!

689
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:50,730
Let's stop. Let's just stop here.

690
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:54,650
Jang Tae Ha, let's stop now.

691
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:58,380
For god's sake, let's just stop.

692
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:00,390
Stop it?

693
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,920
Okay, I got it. Let's stop it.

694
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:09,990
Let's stop it. Get up. Let's end it today!

695
01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:11,910
Come out!

696
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:15,430
<i>District Prosecutor Seo Joon Hyeong</i>

697
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:18,210
What did you say just now?

698
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:22,470
I just said that I abetted in the murder of

699
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:23,720
Agent Gong Gi Chan and Deputy Chief Song Ji Moon.

700
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,850
Mr. Jang Eun Joong?

701
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:28,290
I will turn myself in.

702
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,100
I've come

703
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:32,710
to turn myself in.

704
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:37,000
I was the one who abetted both murders to

705
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:38,740
Shin Gang Ho and Kim Joon Hyeok.

706
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,710
Jump off.

707
01:00:58,890 --> 01:01:02,000
You said you did wrong.

708
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:07,640
Don't spew inanity and jump off, if you really think you've done wrong.

709
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,000
You said let's end it.

710
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:16,180
If you want to end it, jump off in front of me, Ha Myeong Geun.

711
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:21,440
Why don't you jump off? For a jerk who says he'd

712
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:26,920
do everything I want and everything I wish for, 
why can't you jump off?

713
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:32,540
Why can't a jerk who's nothing to lose, whether he dies
today or 10 days from now?

714
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:35,390
Don't just apologize with your trap.

715
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:40,440
Don't just care for your kid with your trap,
 and show your sincerity! Sincerity!

716
01:01:41,830 --> 01:01:44,410
Show with your actions.

717
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:48,090
If you really feel in your heart that you've done me wrong,

718
01:01:48,090 --> 01:01:49,820
jump down!

719
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:52,300
JUMP!

720
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:06,310
<i>♫ It hurts my love. ♫</i>

721
01:02:06,310 --> 01:02:14,750
<i>♫ Even if I just try to look at you, tears form in my eyes and run down. ♫ </i>

722
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:21,380
<i>♫ Even if I die, I can't forget you. My bruised heart ♫</i>

723
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:27,610
<i>♫ Cast me aside for you. My painful love. ♫</i>
