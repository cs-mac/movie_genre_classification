1
00:00:25,434 --> 00:00:28,369
For as long as I can remember,

2
00:00:28,437 --> 00:00:30,428
I've been drawn to sharks.

3
00:00:30,506 --> 00:00:34,738
They're the most amazing
and mysterious animal on Earth.

4
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,974
I thought if I studied them,
I could learn about life.

5
00:00:39,048 --> 00:00:43,542
About balance in the ocean
and how to survive on Earth.

6
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:46,782
That the one animal
that we fear the most

7
00:00:46,856 --> 00:00:49,653
is the one we can't live without.

8
00:01:26,394 --> 00:01:28,328
Predator of the sea,

9
00:01:28,396 --> 00:01:32,127
terror of all men
who enter the ocean,

10
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,862
the very symbol
of lurking danger:

11
00:01:34,936 --> 00:01:36,597
That is the shark.

12
00:02:04,064 --> 00:02:05,554
What is he really?

13
00:02:05,632 --> 00:02:08,123
We know little,
except the shark was here

14
00:02:08,202 --> 00:02:10,397
before the continents
took their present form,

15
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,564
before the dinosaur lived,
and he is still here,

16
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,335
essentially unchanged.

17
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:18,003
One of the oldest living things
on Earth.

18
00:02:39,065 --> 00:02:41,158
How has the shark survived,

19
00:02:41,234 --> 00:02:44,226
when almost all that lived
in the beginnings

20
00:02:44,303 --> 00:02:46,203
has either perished or changed?

21
00:03:00,653 --> 00:03:04,020
Man must know all there is to know
about this enemy.

22
00:03:06,626 --> 00:03:08,651
Whether the shark
is really an enemy.

23
00:03:08,728 --> 00:03:09,990
If he is,

24
00:03:10,062 --> 00:03:12,326
how to protect against him.

25
00:03:12,398 --> 00:03:13,796
If he isn't,

26
00:03:13,865 --> 00:03:16,356
how to live with him.

27
00:03:45,964 --> 00:03:48,956
- You're told your whole life,
since you're a kid,

28
00:03:49,034 --> 00:03:50,968
sharks are dangerous.

29
00:03:51,036 --> 00:03:53,834
You're warned about venturing
too far into the ocean,

30
00:03:53,905 --> 00:03:56,135
but then finally
you're underwater,

31
00:03:56,207 --> 00:03:59,233
and you see the thing
you were taught

32
00:03:59,311 --> 00:04:02,006
your whole life to fear,
and it's perfect,

33
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:04,479
and it doesn't want to hurt you,

34
00:04:04,548 --> 00:04:08,450
and it's the most beautiful thing
you've ever seen,

35
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,215
and your whole world changes.

36
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,296
Ever since I was little,
I've loved the ocean.

37
00:04:29,373 --> 00:04:32,103
Like many kids,
I tried fishing,

38
00:04:32,176 --> 00:04:37,136
but realized I was much happier
swimming with fish than catching them.

39
00:04:37,214 --> 00:04:39,409
Sharks were my favourite animals
on Earth,

40
00:04:39,483 --> 00:04:41,383
but all I'd heard about

41
00:04:41,452 --> 00:04:43,010
was how dangerous they were.

42
00:04:43,087 --> 00:04:46,181
I hated being afraid
and realized the only way

43
00:04:46,256 --> 00:04:50,817
to find out the truth about sharks
was to meet one for myself.

44
00:04:52,695 --> 00:04:54,629
I became
an underwater photographer

45
00:04:54,697 --> 00:04:56,790
and a biologist,

46
00:04:56,866 --> 00:04:59,960
and from that point on,
I followed sharks.

47
00:05:00,036 --> 00:05:03,164
So little is known
about what they really are

48
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:06,140
and how important they are
to life on Earth.

49
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:13,012
Two-thirds of the world's surface
is water,

50
00:05:13,082 --> 00:05:15,642
and over 80º/º of life on Earth

51
00:05:15,718 --> 00:05:17,709
lives in the ocean.

52
00:05:17,787 --> 00:05:21,279
I learned to dive
so I could get close to sharks,

53
00:05:21,357 --> 00:05:25,020
but photographing sharks
was harder than I thought.

54
00:05:26,963 --> 00:05:28,863
They're so afraid of us.

55
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:34,701
Sharks can see us
with more than their eyes.

56
00:05:34,771 --> 00:05:37,239
They can sense our energy,

57
00:05:37,306 --> 00:05:40,797
and they viewed me as a threat.

58
00:05:47,048 --> 00:05:51,542
Sharks have been here
for more than 400 million years,

59
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,579
150 million years
before the dinosaurs,

60
00:05:55,657 --> 00:05:58,524
when life had just begun on land.

61
00:05:58,593 --> 00:06:01,721
There was little oxygen
in the atmosphere,

62
00:06:01,797 --> 00:06:03,594
and only two continents.

63
00:06:03,665 --> 00:06:07,465
Sharks were shaping this world.

64
00:06:07,536 --> 00:06:11,666
Life on Earth
evolved from the sea.

65
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,471
The first animals were tiny,
single-celled organisms

66
00:06:15,544 --> 00:06:18,308
that gave rise to algae, coral,

67
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,848
and tiny planktonic animals.

68
00:06:23,685 --> 00:06:27,814
More invertebrates followed,
including squids and mollusks.

69
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,559
One of the first vertebrates
with jaws,

70
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:35,254
and the only large animal
that's remained unchanged

71
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:37,991
for 400 million years,

72
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,033
is the shark.

73
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:46,934
New animals to evolve in the ocean
have been shaped by their predators,

74
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,907
the sharks,

75
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:51,877
giving rise to schooling behaviour,

76
00:06:51,946 --> 00:06:54,881
camouflage, speed,
size and communication.

77
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:58,180
Sharks control
the populations below them,

78
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:01,050
eliminating species
that were easy prey

79
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:02,986
and creating new ones.

80
00:07:05,326 --> 00:07:07,886
Even though sharks
have very few young

81
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:11,728
and take up to 25 years
to reach sexual maturity,

82
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:16,394
they've managed to survive
through five major extinctions

83
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,994
that wiped most life
from the planet.

84
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:21,666
They're architects of our world.

85
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,269
Most of what people
know about sharks

86
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:28,246
they've heard from the media.

87
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,248
The more time I spent with sharks,

88
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:33,979
the more I realized that they're
nothing like what we're told.

89
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:35,645
They are perfect predators

90
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:38,748
that hold the underwater world
in balance,

91
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:42,022
the lions and tigers of the seas.

92
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,728
I spent so much time underwater

93
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,062
so I could gain their trust

94
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,830
and get close enough
to film them.

95
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:59,610
Everything moved together,

96
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,613
lived together,

97
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:04,649
and died with a purpose.

98
00:08:14,593 --> 00:08:16,618
This shark and his relatives

99
00:08:16,695 --> 00:08:20,290
are long-established
enemies of man.

100
00:08:20,365 --> 00:08:23,960
He is a wicked,
unpredictable opponent.

101
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,664
If sharks are in the area,

102
00:08:26,738 --> 00:08:28,365
you can repel them with sounds,

103
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,670
by striking the surface of the water

104
00:08:30,742 --> 00:08:32,801
with your cupped hand.

105
00:08:32,878 --> 00:08:35,005
Or you can shout underwater.

106
00:08:43,221 --> 00:08:45,519
Among the visual methods
of preventing attacks

107
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,582
are directing a stream of bubbles

108
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:49,957
from your life preserver
in his direction.

109
00:08:52,063 --> 00:08:54,998
Tearing up paper
into small pieces

110
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:56,533
and scattering them

111
00:08:56,601 --> 00:08:58,125
all around the raft.

112
00:09:01,272 --> 00:09:04,332
If a shark threatens to attack you
or damage the raft,

113
00:09:04,408 --> 00:09:06,808
do not try to shoot or knife him.

114
00:09:08,312 --> 00:09:11,713
Chances are you would only
slightly injure and infuriate him.

115
00:09:11,782 --> 00:09:14,376
Remember,

116
00:09:14,452 --> 00:09:17,421
his front end
is practically all mouth.

117
00:09:17,488 --> 00:09:18,853
Once in your raft,

118
00:09:18,923 --> 00:09:21,858
stay there and remain quiet.

119
00:09:21,926 --> 00:09:24,156
Remember that as a human being,

120
00:09:24,228 --> 00:09:27,755
you are smarter than a shark,
if you use your head.

121
00:09:32,336 --> 00:09:36,170
- Elephants kill more people
each year than sharks do,

122
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,538
so there's some deep-seated
psychological revulsion

123
00:09:39,609 --> 00:09:43,773
about a cold-eyed monster
coming out of the deep

124
00:09:43,847 --> 00:09:46,543
and picking you to pieces,
but that is the myth, not the reality.

125
00:09:46,616 --> 00:09:50,052
- It's weird that white sharks
have such a bad reputation,

126
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,987
because they really hardly bite.

127
00:09:53,056 --> 00:09:55,786
If we go into the statistics,
they are not the ones

128
00:09:55,859 --> 00:09:57,156
who bite the most.
Definitely not.

129
00:09:57,227 --> 00:09:59,661
And it's very hard, actually,
to approach a white shark.

130
00:09:59,729 --> 00:10:02,630
It's much easier to repel him
than to actually lure him in,

131
00:10:02,699 --> 00:10:04,462
bring him in,
and then trying to interact.

132
00:10:04,534 --> 00:10:06,968
So I think the main reason
why people are still afraid

133
00:10:07,037 --> 00:10:09,232
of a white shark
is based on the movie Jaws,

134
00:10:09,305 --> 00:10:13,071
and the misconception
is still floating around.

135
00:10:13,143 --> 00:10:16,909
And I think a big part
of the media still tries

136
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,710
to present the white shark
as Jaws.

137
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:35,927
- Three people were hurt Saturday
in another shark attack.

138
00:10:47,543 --> 00:10:50,740
- Time magazine is calling
it the "Summer of the Shark. "

139
00:10:55,217 --> 00:10:57,742
- And of course the question
being asked by some is:

140
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,380
When will it be safe
to return to the water?

141
00:11:03,692 --> 00:11:07,651
- We love to have a monster,
we love to hate. So...

142
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:10,164
And it's not good television

143
00:11:10,232 --> 00:11:13,827
if, you know, this monster
that we presented all these years

144
00:11:13,902 --> 00:11:16,597
actually is a very shy, hesitant animal

145
00:11:16,671 --> 00:11:21,005
that has a hard time,
like any other animal as well.

146
00:11:21,075 --> 00:11:22,440
So we like to have the monster,

147
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,535
and that's why
it's still portrayed this way.

148
00:11:32,253 --> 00:11:33,914
I was on an assignment,

149
00:11:33,988 --> 00:11:36,388
photographing
the Galapagos Islands,

150
00:11:36,457 --> 00:11:38,186
600 miles from Ecuador,

151
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:41,456
in the middle of the Pacific,

152
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:43,121
in total isolation

153
00:11:43,197 --> 00:11:45,324
from the rest of the world.

154
00:11:46,534 --> 00:11:48,161
It's a world heritage site,

155
00:11:48,236 --> 00:11:52,002
full of species
found nowhere else on Earth.

156
00:11:53,608 --> 00:11:56,133
This is where Charles Darwin

157
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,770
developed his theory of evolution.

158
00:11:58,846 --> 00:12:02,804
What I believe
is the whole planet was like this.

159
00:12:02,883 --> 00:12:05,943
I think animals
were amazingly abundant;

160
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:08,351
I think whales
were amazingly abundant,

161
00:12:08,421 --> 00:12:12,755
fish were amazingly abundant;
turtles, birds, everything,

162
00:12:12,826 --> 00:12:15,659
before man got in there

163
00:12:15,729 --> 00:12:18,994
and really hacked
the whole thing to pieces.

164
00:12:19,065 --> 00:12:23,798
- I travelled 160 miles
from the centre of the Galapagos

165
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,202
to Darwin and Wolf,

166
00:12:26,273 --> 00:12:28,605
two remote undersea volcanoes

167
00:12:28,675 --> 00:12:31,940
that barely broke the surface.

168
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:33,946
One of the few places on Earth

169
00:12:34,014 --> 00:12:38,007
where hammerhead sharks
congregate in schools.

170
00:12:41,121 --> 00:12:43,715
We're just getting ready
to go in for a dive

171
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,884
where there's supposed to be
congregating hammerhead sharks.

172
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,757
The undersea currents come up,

173
00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:50,921
bringing nutrient-rich water
to the surface,

174
00:12:50,996 --> 00:12:54,329
which causes a ton
of tiny plankton feeders to school here,

175
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,800
and the hammerhead sharks
come up as well,

176
00:12:56,869 --> 00:12:58,632
and they circle in the current

177
00:12:58,704 --> 00:13:01,730
and go back down at night
to feed on squid.

178
00:13:01,807 --> 00:13:04,002
So we're gonna go down
to maybe 130 feet

179
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:06,340
and see if we can find
some schooling hammerhead sharks,

180
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:08,312
possibly a silky shark or two.

181
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,084
The Galapagos hosts

182
00:13:13,152 --> 00:13:15,882
one of the largest marine
reserves on Earth,

183
00:13:15,955 --> 00:13:18,685
where sharks
are cherished and protected.

184
00:13:20,593 --> 00:13:24,290
Hammerheads are some
of the most misunderstood species.

185
00:13:24,363 --> 00:13:27,457
They are incredibly shy animals.

186
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:29,194
Hammerheads, like all sharks,

187
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:31,828
have two more senses than people.

188
00:13:31,904 --> 00:13:36,671
They have lateral lines
running along the sides of their bodies,

189
00:13:36,742 --> 00:13:38,710
that can detect movement
in the water.

190
00:13:40,478 --> 00:13:43,538
Their heads
are a giant sensory system

191
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,776
that detects electro-magnetic fields,

192
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:50,287
enabling them to find food
that's hidden from view

193
00:13:50,355 --> 00:13:52,585
and to feel my heartbeat.

194
00:13:52,657 --> 00:13:54,147
They can feel me

195
00:13:54,225 --> 00:13:57,319
and know if I'm excited or scared.

196
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,794
They're so afraid of us,

197
00:14:00,865 --> 00:14:02,730
that if I'm not calm,

198
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,734
keeping my heart rate low,

199
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,997
they won't come
anywhere near me.

200
00:14:16,848 --> 00:14:19,817
Hammerheads use
the Earth's magnetic field

201
00:14:19,884 --> 00:14:22,876
to follow undersea ridges
like road maps,

202
00:14:22,954 --> 00:14:26,515
navigating thousands of miles
through the oceans.

203
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:30,686
Sharks are normally solitary,

204
00:14:30,761 --> 00:14:32,422
but hammerheads come together

205
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:35,431
only at a few undersea pinnacles

206
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,797
to socialize and mate.

207
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:43,033
The schools are made up
of mostly females,

208
00:14:43,106 --> 00:14:46,598
with the largest vying
for position in the centre,

209
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,975
where the males come
to look for mates.

210
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,172
Dominant females,
which can be 12 feet long,

211
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,184
control their position in the school

212
00:14:55,252 --> 00:14:56,947
using aggressive displays,

213
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:00,046
pushing subordinate females
to the fringes.

214
00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:04,186
The schools break up at night,

215
00:15:04,261 --> 00:15:07,162
when they descend
into deeper water to feed.

216
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,494
We know so little about sharks

217
00:15:09,566 --> 00:15:11,966
that a new species of hammerhead

218
00:15:12,035 --> 00:15:15,663
was just found
in the Atlantic Ocean in 2006.

219
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,471
The shape of their head

220
00:15:20,543 --> 00:15:23,774
makes them one of the most
manoeuvrable and feared sharks.

221
00:15:23,846 --> 00:15:25,279
But the truth is,

222
00:15:25,348 --> 00:15:27,646
there's no record
of a hammerhead shark

223
00:15:27,717 --> 00:15:29,344
ever killing anyone.

224
00:15:58,414 --> 00:16:00,541
When we surfaced from the dive,

225
00:16:00,616 --> 00:16:02,413
we found two fishing boats

226
00:16:02,485 --> 00:16:05,317
trailing 60 miles of long lines.

227
00:16:07,255 --> 00:16:10,782
A line with 16,000 baited hooks

228
00:16:10,859 --> 00:16:14,955
that would stretch from Earth
to outer space.

229
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:19,933
The boats fled,

230
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:23,300
because long-line fishing
is illegal in the Galapagos,

231
00:16:23,371 --> 00:16:26,067
and we were left with the lines.

232
00:16:29,577 --> 00:16:31,807
I hopped in the water
as soon as I could

233
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,905
and brought my cameras in
and tried to film,

234
00:16:33,982 --> 00:16:35,813
whatever I could find
on the long lines,

235
00:16:35,884 --> 00:16:38,011
and we swam for probably
two or three kilometres,

236
00:16:38,086 --> 00:16:39,451
pulling ourselves along the lines,

237
00:16:39,521 --> 00:16:42,957
and unclipping
every baited hook we could find.

238
00:16:43,024 --> 00:16:46,585
The first fish I found
was a seven-foot-long sailfish,

239
00:16:46,661 --> 00:16:49,129
and it was dead.

240
00:16:49,197 --> 00:16:52,757
It suffocated because it wrapped itself
up in the long line.

241
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,802
So it couldn't keep swimming
to keep breathing.

242
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:02,006
Farther along the line,
I found a dorado.

243
00:17:02,076 --> 00:17:03,600
It was still alive.

244
00:17:03,677 --> 00:17:06,305
It was swimming in a circle,

245
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,109
the largest it could

246
00:17:08,182 --> 00:17:11,310
considering the long line
attached to it.

247
00:17:14,822 --> 00:17:18,121
I slowly pulled myself close
so I wouldn't scare it,

248
00:17:18,192 --> 00:17:19,659
and I cut it loose.

249
00:17:29,369 --> 00:17:31,997
Then I found the sharks.

250
00:17:37,444 --> 00:17:39,241
For 60 miles,

251
00:17:39,313 --> 00:17:41,746
sharks were dying on those lines.

252
00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:45,117
They struggle so much

253
00:17:45,184 --> 00:17:48,585
that they entangle themselves
and suffocate.

254
00:17:48,654 --> 00:17:50,918
There were only a few left alive,

255
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,617
and I cut them loose.

256
00:17:55,695 --> 00:17:57,094
In total,

257
00:17:57,163 --> 00:17:58,630
we found 160 sharks,

258
00:17:58,698 --> 00:18:00,256
five sailfish,

259
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,961
four dorado and a tuna.

260
00:18:06,139 --> 00:18:09,131
It felt like part of my family
was dying.

261
00:18:13,513 --> 00:18:15,947
Something shifted that day,

262
00:18:16,015 --> 00:18:17,812
and I changed.

263
00:18:26,192 --> 00:18:27,783
This is just a line,

264
00:18:27,859 --> 00:18:30,953
a long line with baited hooks on it,

265
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:33,156
but many, many animals -

266
00:18:33,231 --> 00:18:37,634
most animals swimming around
in the surface waters

267
00:18:37,702 --> 00:18:39,363
are interested
in those baited hooks,

268
00:18:39,437 --> 00:18:41,701
so take the hooks
and subsequently get caught.

269
00:18:41,773 --> 00:18:46,767
And they may or may not be
what the fisherman are looking for,

270
00:18:46,845 --> 00:18:49,939
and things like leatherback turtles
or some marine mammals

271
00:18:50,015 --> 00:18:52,745
can simply get entangled
in that line of gear.

272
00:18:52,817 --> 00:18:54,751
There are more selective ways
of fishing,

273
00:18:54,819 --> 00:18:57,879
there's a lot of waste
that goes on out there.

274
00:18:57,956 --> 00:19:00,186
And I think one of the big reasons

275
00:19:00,258 --> 00:19:03,887
it continues to go on,
is because we don't see it.

276
00:19:03,962 --> 00:19:07,125
- We know that predators
are fundamental in controlling

277
00:19:07,199 --> 00:19:10,396
the structure and the functioning
of the ecosystems.

278
00:19:10,468 --> 00:19:14,734
So basically if you cut off
the head of the ecosystem,

279
00:19:14,806 --> 00:19:17,137
if you wish,
the top species,

280
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:20,575
the top carnivores that control
a lot of the processes

281
00:19:20,644 --> 00:19:22,635
lower down in the food web,

282
00:19:22,713 --> 00:19:26,479
you're removing a really important
controlling agent,

283
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:30,452
and that could cause upheaval
in the lower tropic levels

284
00:19:30,521 --> 00:19:31,954
like the plants

285
00:19:32,022 --> 00:19:33,353
and the zooplankton.

286
00:19:33,424 --> 00:19:36,791
The ocean is basically
the life-support system

287
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,293
of the planet.

288
00:19:38,362 --> 00:19:40,956
To change
that life-support system

289
00:19:41,031 --> 00:19:44,660
in any major way
is a risky thing.

290
00:19:44,735 --> 00:19:48,000
We know from the past
that when oceans have changed

291
00:19:48,072 --> 00:19:50,666
that life on Earth has changed.

292
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,315
- I needed to know
why people were killing sharks,

293
00:19:59,383 --> 00:20:02,318
and what I could do to stop it.

294
00:20:02,386 --> 00:20:04,785
So I left my job as a photographer

295
00:20:04,854 --> 00:20:07,618
and set out
to make a film about them,

296
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,681
but they were gone.

297
00:20:12,729 --> 00:20:16,096
In places where I'd always
found hundreds of sharks,

298
00:20:16,165 --> 00:20:18,030
I only found a few.

299
00:20:19,569 --> 00:20:22,766
Shark populations have been decimated
all over the world

300
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:25,273
and the last sharks
were being hunted down

301
00:20:25,341 --> 00:20:27,809
in the few remaining sanctuaries.

302
00:20:27,877 --> 00:20:30,209
Nobody noticed.

303
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:35,616
Everyone wanted to save pandas,
elephants and bears,

304
00:20:35,685 --> 00:20:38,051
and the world
was afraid of sharks.

305
00:20:41,557 --> 00:20:44,253
- I read this story
about this boy who was 13, in Japan,

306
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:46,591
and got swallowed whole.
It didn't even bite him,

307
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:48,290
it just swallowed him.
Yeah?

308
00:20:48,364 --> 00:20:50,161
- And they cut out
and they found his body.

309
00:20:50,233 --> 00:20:52,223
And it wasn't even bit,
and that's scary.

310
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:54,292
So if you're not seeing sharks here,

311
00:20:54,369 --> 00:20:55,961
why are you so afraid
of the water?

312
00:20:56,038 --> 00:20:57,562
Because they'll still bite you

313
00:20:57,639 --> 00:21:00,107
and I... I panic, I always panic.

314
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,302
I'm such a wimp.

315
00:21:02,377 --> 00:21:05,676
Well, what are your chances
of being bitten by a shark?

316
00:21:05,747 --> 00:21:07,977
They must be so small.
- No, not really.

317
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:11,110
- No, it's small. I've never seen
a shark here in my life.

318
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,120
- I've never heard
of anywhere else

319
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,053
getting bit by sharks
as much as here.

320
00:21:15,123 --> 00:21:16,590
That's true.

321
00:21:16,658 --> 00:21:19,491
- Not even in Daytona.
Here is like the worst.

322
00:21:19,561 --> 00:21:23,122
- Sharks rarely bite human beings,
but never because they're hungry,

323
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:26,463
and say, "Ah, look,
there's something juicy over there. "

324
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,298
They try to figure out what we are.

325
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,168
They don't know what we are,
so they explore us.

326
00:21:31,239 --> 00:21:34,106
On the very rare occasions
they come that close,

327
00:21:34,176 --> 00:21:36,474
they actually can just do
an exploratory bite

328
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:40,378
and that's why the majority of all bites
are very, very superficial.

329
00:21:40,448 --> 00:21:42,882
You hardly have
really serious bites.

330
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:46,442
So that tells us something,
60 to 100 bites every year

331
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,750
out of these millions and millions
of encounters

332
00:21:48,823 --> 00:21:50,882
that we have with these animals.

333
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:53,552
So just based on that,
sharks cannot be dangerous.

334
00:21:53,627 --> 00:21:55,356
People think: Well, they're dumb,

335
00:21:55,429 --> 00:21:57,420
they're stupid.
That's not true.

336
00:21:57,498 --> 00:21:58,931
Their intelligence is quite amazing.

337
00:21:58,999 --> 00:22:01,832
They have short-term memories,
long-term memories,

338
00:22:01,902 --> 00:22:03,699
they can learn by observation.

339
00:22:03,771 --> 00:22:06,865
So nothing is stupid or primitive
in these animals.

340
00:22:06,941 --> 00:22:10,604
So all the ideas,
well, they just follow a blood trail,

341
00:22:10,678 --> 00:22:13,010
they just bite everything that is shiny.

342
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,483
Well, pretty quick you realize,
hey, that is all wrong.

343
00:22:33,199 --> 00:22:35,667
- In just one year,
crocodiles around the world

344
00:22:35,735 --> 00:22:37,999
wiped out as many people
as sharks have killed

345
00:22:38,071 --> 00:22:40,631
over the past 100.

346
00:22:40,707 --> 00:22:42,641
The crocodile is protected.

347
00:22:49,682 --> 00:22:50,979
No?

348
00:22:55,555 --> 00:22:56,988
The sharks not?

349
00:22:57,791 --> 00:22:59,019
Yeah?

350
00:23:00,093 --> 00:23:01,458
Yeah?

351
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,063
So I should not...

352
00:23:05,131 --> 00:23:08,328
Like, it's not a good idea
to go swimming with sharks?

353
00:23:19,578 --> 00:23:23,036
- They're the scourge of the ocean
and everyone should go and catch one.

354
00:23:23,115 --> 00:23:25,845
All the greens can come around
and say that these things,

355
00:23:25,918 --> 00:23:28,944
"Let 'em live, let' em live. " Okay?
We can live on land too,

356
00:23:29,021 --> 00:23:32,513
but we don't go out there
and bite the bums off them, do we?

357
00:23:32,591 --> 00:23:34,491
But they come in here and get us.

358
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,495
How bad
is the shark as a predator?

359
00:23:37,563 --> 00:23:40,623
You make it sound
as though it really is a direct threat

360
00:23:40,699 --> 00:23:44,191
to human beings
who dare swim in the water.

361
00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:46,260
- Well, you try swimming,
with a shark like that

362
00:23:46,338 --> 00:23:48,602
in 8 feet of water
and you'll find out,

363
00:23:48,674 --> 00:23:51,973
because we got no hope,
if they decide to eat us.

364
00:23:52,044 --> 00:23:54,979
But don't you think
that one effect of you going out

365
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:56,844
and capturing sharks
and talking this way

366
00:23:56,915 --> 00:23:59,247
is that you bring about
an hysteria in people,

367
00:23:59,318 --> 00:24:00,649
they're going to panic?

368
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:02,380
No, I've saved a lot of lives.

369
00:24:02,454 --> 00:24:05,854
If it wasn't for me
and what I've done in the last 25 years,

370
00:24:05,923 --> 00:24:07,584
there'd be a lot more people killed.

371
00:24:21,772 --> 00:24:25,003
- The fact is,
sharks do not eat people.

372
00:24:26,544 --> 00:24:29,843
If they did, I would've been eaten
a long time ago.

373
00:24:31,315 --> 00:24:34,944
Most sharks have teeth
which are ineffective cutting tools,

374
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:37,419
and can't effectively remove flesh

375
00:24:37,488 --> 00:24:39,956
from something larger
than their mouths.

376
00:24:40,024 --> 00:24:42,015
One hundred needles in your leg

377
00:24:42,093 --> 00:24:45,494
would have a tough time
removing a chunk of flesh.

378
00:24:45,563 --> 00:24:48,589
Most sharks lack
the equipment they'd need

379
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:52,931
to go after large animals like us,
and they know that.

380
00:24:53,003 --> 00:24:55,972
They've evolved
to eat certain prey items,

381
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:58,303
and most sharks are picky eaters.

382
00:24:59,876 --> 00:25:01,741
They won't bother wasting energy

383
00:25:01,811 --> 00:25:04,974
going after something
they know they can't eat efficiently.

384
00:25:06,683 --> 00:25:08,742
When a shark mistake does happen,

385
00:25:08,818 --> 00:25:12,652
the person inevitably
ends up back on shore.

386
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,623
In most shark attacks,

387
00:25:15,692 --> 00:25:17,683
flesh is never removed.

388
00:25:17,761 --> 00:25:20,457
Even in the odd case
where someone dies,

389
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,930
it's usually because of blood loss,

390
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:25,433
not because the shark
ate the person.

391
00:25:25,502 --> 00:25:28,801
A twelve-foot
or even a six-foot fish

392
00:25:28,872 --> 00:25:31,807
could do anything it wanted
to a human,

393
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:33,308
and they don't.

394
00:25:33,376 --> 00:25:36,937
It's a huge testament
to sharks' sensory systems

395
00:25:37,013 --> 00:25:39,106
how few people
are attacked each year.

396
00:25:39,182 --> 00:25:42,582
You wouldn't go for a run
next to a pride of lions,

397
00:25:42,651 --> 00:25:45,518
but we do this with sharks
all the time.

398
00:25:45,588 --> 00:25:48,182
There are millions of people
entering the water every year

399
00:25:48,257 --> 00:25:50,020
in areas where sharks hunt,

400
00:25:50,092 --> 00:25:52,253
and very few people are bitten.

401
00:25:52,328 --> 00:25:54,956
If they wanted to eat us,
they would.

402
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:04,264
The mythology about sharks
has traditionally been,

403
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,275
uh, they're kind of
the embodiment of evil

404
00:26:07,343 --> 00:26:10,278
and they have sharp teeth
and they kill people.

405
00:26:10,346 --> 00:26:15,113
But the fact is,
people used to think of whales that way,

406
00:26:15,184 --> 00:26:18,642
whales used to be
dangerous Leviathans.

407
00:26:18,721 --> 00:26:21,053
I mean,
just read Moby Dick, you know.

408
00:26:21,123 --> 00:26:23,819
Moby Dick was portrayed
by Captain Ahab

409
00:26:23,892 --> 00:26:26,622
as being a monster of the deep.

410
00:26:26,695 --> 00:26:28,628
You know, a man hunter.

411
00:26:33,101 --> 00:26:34,966
But everything in the environment,

412
00:26:35,036 --> 00:26:37,334
everything that exists,
eats something else.

413
00:26:50,585 --> 00:26:53,053
We tend to be afraid
of spiders and snakes,

414
00:26:53,121 --> 00:26:55,589
but, you know,
we love puppy dogs and seals.

415
00:26:57,825 --> 00:27:01,454
Once people see whales or sharks
in a different light,

416
00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:03,326
they can change their mind.

417
00:27:03,398 --> 00:27:04,831
These are beautiful creatures,

418
00:27:04,899 --> 00:27:06,924
absolutely beautiful creatures

419
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:10,459
that have every right in the world
to live on this planet.

420
00:27:58,752 --> 00:28:01,619
- I went to all the major
conservation organizations

421
00:28:01,688 --> 00:28:06,647
and there was virtually no one
doing anything to save sharks.

422
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,717
- Are you really concerned
or you just wanna call names?

423
00:28:08,794 --> 00:28:10,193
- Oh, / am very concerned,
extremely concerned.

424
00:28:10,262 --> 00:28:12,924
- Well, then, let's see some action
instead of all of this whining.

425
00:28:12,998 --> 00:28:15,398
Then I met up with Paul Watson.

426
00:28:15,468 --> 00:28:17,163
What is my type, sir?

427
00:28:17,236 --> 00:28:19,966
- The renegade
of the conservation movement.

428
00:28:21,674 --> 00:28:24,507
He sunk a whole Norwegian
whaling fleet

429
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:28,206
and ended pirate whaling
in the North Atlantic

430
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,578
when no one else could.

431
00:28:30,649 --> 00:28:33,243
Paul was one of the original
activists in Greenpeace

432
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:36,516
and he's been at war against poaching
for 30 years.

433
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:38,750
- I set up the Sea Shepherd
Conservation Society in 1977

434
00:28:38,824 --> 00:28:41,156
as an organization
to intervene directly

435
00:28:41,227 --> 00:28:44,355
to uphold international conservation
laws, regulations and treaties,

436
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:47,160
so it's not a protest organization,

437
00:28:47,233 --> 00:28:50,361
but an organization
to really fill a vacuum,

438
00:28:50,436 --> 00:28:54,769
because there really is no enforcement
agencies anywhere in the world

439
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:57,672
to uphold these international
laws and treaties.

440
00:29:04,415 --> 00:29:06,542
They're trying to sink the ship;

441
00:29:06,618 --> 00:29:08,313
they are trying to sink the ship.

442
00:29:08,386 --> 00:29:11,822
- So part of the role of the activist,
like Paul Watson, is:

443
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:14,188
"Don't let them get away with it,

444
00:29:14,259 --> 00:29:16,591
or make 'em do it in the light of day. "

445
00:29:16,661 --> 00:29:17,992
He's a hero,

446
00:29:18,062 --> 00:29:20,792
someone who just does

447
00:29:20,865 --> 00:29:23,595
what the politicians
haven't got the guts to do.

448
00:29:23,668 --> 00:29:25,226
Captain Paul Watson

449
00:29:25,303 --> 00:29:27,203
leads possibly the most violent,

450
00:29:27,272 --> 00:29:30,469
and radical, green movement
in the world.

451
00:29:30,542 --> 00:29:33,909
- Well, if you kill anybody,
I'm holding you personally responsible.

452
00:29:33,978 --> 00:29:37,709
You have no authority over us,
we're in international waters. Over.

453
00:29:37,782 --> 00:29:39,977
Move aside, get 'em!

454
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,819
Launched from the gunboat,
police attack Sea Shepherd

455
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:50,087
with tear gas bullets
and tear gas canisters.

456
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:55,029
It's the first time in history
that an unarmed conservation vessel

457
00:29:55,098 --> 00:29:57,032
has been fired at.

458
00:29:59,303 --> 00:30:02,431
- No, really what we're here to do
is to, you know,

459
00:30:02,506 --> 00:30:06,135
to rock the boat, to make noise;
to make people think.

460
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:08,178
That's really the main objective

461
00:30:08,245 --> 00:30:10,213
of the Sea Shepherd
Conservation Society.

462
00:30:14,017 --> 00:30:16,281
Why aren't you people
doing anything?

463
00:30:19,957 --> 00:30:21,788
The only violence
that's being committed

464
00:30:21,859 --> 00:30:23,451
is the illegal slaughter of whales,

465
00:30:23,527 --> 00:30:27,258
and that is violent
and that is the crime. Over.

466
00:30:42,545 --> 00:30:44,638
- Paul and Sea Shepherd
were launching a campaign

467
00:30:44,714 --> 00:30:49,174
against poaching in two of the world's
last sanctuaries for sharks:

468
00:30:49,252 --> 00:30:51,083
The Galapagos, Ecuador,

469
00:30:51,153 --> 00:30:54,316
and in Cocos, Costa Rica.

470
00:30:56,192 --> 00:30:58,752
Cocos is a tiny island
in the middle of the Pacific,

471
00:30:58,828 --> 00:31:02,059
360 miles from Costa Rica.

472
00:31:02,131 --> 00:31:05,294
It's a national park
and a world heritage site

473
00:31:05,368 --> 00:31:08,667
with the greatest concentration
of sharks in the world.

474
00:31:11,173 --> 00:31:13,733
But Costa Rica has no money
to protect it,

475
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:15,800
and poachers
raid the waters every day.

476
00:31:15,878 --> 00:31:18,471
No, it's been cut in the head!

477
00:31:18,546 --> 00:31:20,070
The sharks were being wiped out.

478
00:31:20,148 --> 00:31:23,015
Well, Jesus Christ,
put it out of its misery.

479
00:31:31,626 --> 00:31:35,528
- So the President of Costa Rica
asked Sea Shepherd for help.

480
00:31:37,032 --> 00:31:39,330
Why, it's illegal as well.

481
00:31:39,401 --> 00:31:42,370
- Paul was my kinda guy,
the only one I knew

482
00:31:42,437 --> 00:31:45,668
who was doing anything
to save sharks.

483
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:50,109
He asked me to join the campaign
to stop the illegal fishing of sharks.

484
00:31:50,178 --> 00:31:51,475
Okay.

485
00:31:54,115 --> 00:31:55,980
I joined Paul in Los Angeles

486
00:31:56,051 --> 00:31:58,747
aboard the Sea Shepherd ship,
the Ocean Warrior,

487
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,845
and we started our journey south,

488
00:32:00,922 --> 00:32:03,982
3,000 miles to Costa Rica.

489
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:10,294
They repaint and rename the boat
on every new campaign

490
00:32:10,364 --> 00:32:13,492
to avoid being recognized
by the poachers.

491
00:32:13,567 --> 00:32:17,628
The Ocean Warrior has been
in battle against poachers

492
00:32:17,705 --> 00:32:20,435
dozens of times
and proudly displays its kill flags,

493
00:32:20,507 --> 00:32:24,170
the flags of boats it has rammed
or sunk, on the side of the ship.

494
00:32:24,244 --> 00:32:26,371
It's equipped with a can opener,

495
00:32:26,447 --> 00:32:27,971
a hydraulic steel blade

496
00:32:28,048 --> 00:32:30,710
that extends from the side of the boat
in case of battle.

497
00:32:34,221 --> 00:32:39,022
We traveled south on the open ocean
for 12 days straight.

498
00:32:42,396 --> 00:32:46,355
2,500 miles from Los Angeles
and 50 miles inside Guatemalan waters,

499
00:32:46,433 --> 00:32:49,732
we found a pirate long-lining boat
illegally poaching sharks.

500
00:32:49,803 --> 00:32:53,761
Doesn't take much
to catch illegal fishing around here,

501
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,273
I'll tell ya.

502
00:32:55,341 --> 00:32:56,740
Jesus Christ,

503
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:58,299
they're going slower.

504
00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:03,648
The Varadero was from Costa Rica
and had no permit

505
00:33:03,716 --> 00:33:07,277
to fish outside of Costa Rica
or inside Guatemala.

506
00:33:07,353 --> 00:33:08,718
Which way?

507
00:33:08,788 --> 00:33:10,449
We radioed Guatemala,

508
00:33:10,523 --> 00:33:13,458
who asked us to escort the boat
into port for arrest.

509
00:33:15,028 --> 00:33:18,054
We asked that they bring in their lines
and release any sharks

510
00:33:18,131 --> 00:33:20,099
that were caught,

511
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:21,463
but they weren't releasing
the sharks.

512
00:33:21,534 --> 00:33:24,162
They're not answering?

513
00:33:24,237 --> 00:33:26,398
We were racing them to the lines;

514
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:29,964
every time they got ahead of us,
they killed more sharks.

515
00:33:30,276 --> 00:33:33,712
- All these boats,
from many countries,

516
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,941
when they go fishing -

517
00:33:36,015 --> 00:33:38,848
and that's actually
everywhere in the world -

518
00:33:38,918 --> 00:33:41,579
all they want is profit.

519
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:43,314
Once they've left port,

520
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:46,448
it's like the ocean is a free place;

521
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,959
you do what you want out there.

522
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,291
They got another shark!

523
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:52,990
Got a shark?

524
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:55,363
Tell that guy
to release that shark.

525
00:33:55,434 --> 00:33:58,767
Tell him that if he doesn't release
those sharks,

526
00:33:58,837 --> 00:34:01,101
we're gonna sink his line.

527
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:05,602
Hey, Rob, did you get a picture
of that shark?

528
00:34:05,677 --> 00:34:09,272
If he doesn't stop,
we'll run up ahead and grab the line.

529
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:11,645
Actually hold on,
I'm gonna stop right here.

530
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:26,319
Bring it up to the bow and see
if you can get it on the winch.

531
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,163
Got their line?
Grab the line.

532
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:34,136
If you can grab the line on...
Where's the next one?

533
00:34:35,539 --> 00:34:38,474
Get it? Goddamn,
as fast as we get up to it,

534
00:34:38,542 --> 00:34:40,009
they're pulling it off.

535
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:43,308
- They wouldn't stop
killing sharks.

536
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:46,645
The sharks were incredibly
important to them.

537
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:55,686
They were killing them
for their fins.

538
00:34:57,495 --> 00:34:59,895
Shark-fin soup
is a symbol of wealth

539
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:03,058
and served as a sign of respect.

540
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:05,534
The soup has been around
for centuries,

541
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:09,767
but only in the last two decades
has it boomed in popularity.

542
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,603
The fin is tasteless,

543
00:35:11,675 --> 00:35:15,805
adding only texture to a soup
flavoured with chicken or pork broth.

544
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,177
It became a status symbol,

545
00:35:18,248 --> 00:35:20,113
served at weddings, banquets,

546
00:35:20,183 --> 00:35:21,514
and expensive dinners.

547
00:35:21,584 --> 00:35:24,382
A single pound of fin
is worth more than $200 US,

548
00:35:24,454 --> 00:35:26,922
and the shark-fin industry

549
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:29,458
is a billion-dollar juggernaut.

550
00:35:29,526 --> 00:35:32,689
Every year,
an estimated 30 to 70 million sharks

551
00:35:32,762 --> 00:35:35,356
are killed to support
a growing worldwide trade

552
00:35:35,431 --> 00:35:38,400
in their fins and other products.

553
00:35:38,468 --> 00:35:41,164
But the biggest prize is the shark fin.

554
00:35:41,237 --> 00:35:43,205
Half a world away,
in Hong Kong and China,

555
00:35:43,273 --> 00:35:45,036
shark-fin soup is a delicacy.

556
00:35:45,108 --> 00:35:47,235
It sells for up to $90 a bowl.

557
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:49,437
It's a royal food;

558
00:35:49,512 --> 00:35:51,377
it's the food of the emperors.

559
00:35:51,447 --> 00:35:53,574
They make a soup out of the fins,

560
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:56,050
and any Chinese chef
that's worth his weight

561
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:58,815
has to be able to make
great shark-fin soup,

562
00:35:58,888 --> 00:36:02,119
as strange as that may seem,
and this is causing the demise

563
00:36:02,192 --> 00:36:04,353
of the populations of sharks
in the ocean.

564
00:36:22,978 --> 00:36:24,445
The word was out

565
00:36:24,513 --> 00:36:26,071
that fins meant money,

566
00:36:26,148 --> 00:36:28,673
and sharks were being killed
solely for their fins

567
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,741
in virtually every country
with a coastline.

568
00:36:42,064 --> 00:36:44,794
There's so much money in fins,

569
00:36:44,866 --> 00:36:48,063
that only trafficking drugs
rivals fins for profit.

570
00:37:05,653 --> 00:37:09,646
- People thousands of years from now,
if we manage to survive,

571
00:37:09,724 --> 00:37:12,625
aren't gonna have much respect
for cultures

572
00:37:12,693 --> 00:37:16,322
that deprived them of the things
that we now have

573
00:37:16,397 --> 00:37:17,864
that diminish their world for them.

574
00:37:17,932 --> 00:37:20,924
They're not gonna have any respect
for those cultures at all,

575
00:37:21,002 --> 00:37:24,267
just as we don't have any respect
for the culture of slavery.

576
00:37:31,846 --> 00:37:35,612
- For the first time
in over 400 million years,

577
00:37:35,683 --> 00:37:37,310
sharks were prey.

578
00:37:45,625 --> 00:37:47,923
They were even killing whale sharks.

579
00:37:53,833 --> 00:37:55,596
The largest fish on Earth

580
00:37:55,669 --> 00:37:58,934
that eats only microscopic plankton
and has no teeth.

581
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:09,578
They are the gentle giants
that roam the warm waters of the world

582
00:38:09,649 --> 00:38:11,583
following plankton blooms.

583
00:38:24,831 --> 00:38:27,595
We know nothing
about their life cycles,

584
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:29,259
where they mate,

585
00:38:29,336 --> 00:38:31,394
or how long they live,

586
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:34,462
though they're thought
to live as long as us.

587
00:38:42,548 --> 00:38:45,244
And now the whale shark,
along with their relatives,

588
00:38:45,317 --> 00:38:48,878
the great white shark
and the basking shark,

589
00:38:48,954 --> 00:38:50,581
are endangered.

590
00:39:13,846 --> 00:39:15,746
A large fin like this

591
00:39:15,814 --> 00:39:19,408
can now sell
for more than $10,000 in China,

592
00:39:19,484 --> 00:39:22,419
and conservationists say
the growing trade in shark fin

593
00:39:22,487 --> 00:39:25,820
has become a serious threat
not only to whale sharks,

594
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:28,916
but also to other shark species
almost everywhere.

595
00:39:28,993 --> 00:39:30,893
By the time it gets to Asia,

596
00:39:30,962 --> 00:39:35,490
it's gonna be up to $200 US a pound
for the dry shark fin.

597
00:39:35,566 --> 00:39:38,592
So it goes from 80 cents here
to a myriad of middlemen,

598
00:39:38,669 --> 00:39:41,297
ending up at $200 US
from 80 cents,

599
00:39:41,372 --> 00:39:43,670
so it's a magical little process

600
00:39:43,741 --> 00:39:47,074
that we've gotta figure out
how it gets there.

601
00:39:47,145 --> 00:39:49,943
Yeah, it's the fin, fish.

602
00:39:50,014 --> 00:39:53,848
They make some kind of pills
of a shark fin.

603
00:39:53,918 --> 00:39:58,287
- In Asia, they think
because sharks don't get sick

604
00:39:58,356 --> 00:40:00,950
as easily as other animals do

605
00:40:01,025 --> 00:40:04,517
that sharks
have some magical power to heal,

606
00:40:04,595 --> 00:40:07,188
and it's all false information

607
00:40:07,264 --> 00:40:10,324
because sharks get cancer,
sharks get problems.

608
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:16,369
- He doesn't want us to film.
- Not allowed to film?

609
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,102
He tells us to leave.

610
00:40:19,176 --> 00:40:21,736
Uh, we just went in restaurant
Lun Fung and got kicked out.

611
00:40:21,812 --> 00:40:24,337
They do serve shark fin,
you can get it in a takeout form.

612
00:40:24,414 --> 00:40:27,406
You can even go to pharmacies
to buy shark fin in pill form,

613
00:40:27,484 --> 00:40:29,349
because of its powers
to make you strong.

614
00:40:29,419 --> 00:40:32,217
That shows you the misconceptions
everyone has about sharks,

615
00:40:32,289 --> 00:40:35,383
that they think because sharks
are resilient to some parasites,

616
00:40:35,459 --> 00:40:38,895
and they don't get sick
as often as people do,

617
00:40:38,962 --> 00:40:42,693
that if you eat sharks
that power's gonna transfer to you.

618
00:41:00,282 --> 00:41:04,719
- Some companies have capitalized
on the sharks' resilience to disease,

619
00:41:04,787 --> 00:41:08,223
marketing shark cartilage
as a cancer or arthritis treatment.

620
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:11,282
But there's no scientific backing
to this at all.

621
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,987
It's actually been proven

622
00:41:13,062 --> 00:41:15,394
to do nothing to cure disease,

623
00:41:15,464 --> 00:41:18,194
and now sharks are so contaminated
with mercury and other pollutants

624
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,894
we've put in the ocean

625
00:41:19,969 --> 00:41:21,402
that eating shark products

626
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:24,337
is more likely
to cause disease than cure it.

627
00:41:33,249 --> 00:41:35,581
The Varadero
continued finning sharks

628
00:41:35,651 --> 00:41:38,017
and throwing the bodies overboard.

629
00:41:40,322 --> 00:41:42,221
We tried to talk with them:

630
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:45,851
They are illegally fishing
and they have to come with us.

631
00:41:45,927 --> 00:41:49,624
- It was easy to see their motivation -
money, big money -

632
00:41:49,697 --> 00:41:51,892
but they were poaching sharks
illegally.

633
00:41:51,966 --> 00:41:54,901
On instructions
from the authorities in Guatemala,

634
00:41:54,969 --> 00:41:57,961
we ordered them
to stop killing sharks

635
00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:00,098
and follow us into port.
Yeah, ask him.

636
00:42:00,174 --> 00:42:01,641
He's got to make a decision,

637
00:42:01,709 --> 00:42:05,668
whether we're gonna tow him
or he's going in under his own power.

638
00:42:05,747 --> 00:42:09,911
- They're dragging a shark!
- But they refused and took off.

639
00:42:09,984 --> 00:42:12,043
Now they decided to run from us.

640
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,951
They know that if we take them there,

641
00:42:14,022 --> 00:42:16,718
they're gonna lose their boat there,
that's pretty sure.

642
00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:19,783
So we're gonna have to go back
and force them back.

643
00:42:19,861 --> 00:42:21,692
- We chased them
with water cannons,

644
00:42:21,763 --> 00:42:24,197
in hopes of flooding
or stalling their engines.

645
00:42:24,265 --> 00:42:26,426
So we can arrest them?

646
00:42:39,479 --> 00:42:41,037
We gonna hit 'em?

647
00:42:50,657 --> 00:42:52,249
Unless people are prepared

648
00:42:52,326 --> 00:42:54,988
to devote their lives
to solving these problems,

649
00:42:55,062 --> 00:42:57,053
nothing's really going to change.

650
00:42:57,130 --> 00:42:59,121
But you don't need everybody.

651
00:43:13,347 --> 00:43:14,746
You just simply need
a small percentage.

652
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,840
Five, seven percent
is starting to make a big impact.

653
00:43:18,884 --> 00:43:21,546
Okay, let's get ready.
This is gonna be close.

654
00:43:36,202 --> 00:43:38,864
- The Varadero finally agreed
to follow us into port,

655
00:43:38,938 --> 00:43:41,338
where we could deliver them
to the authorities.

656
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:00,049
About three hours from port,
we got word

657
00:44:00,126 --> 00:44:03,323
that Guatemala had sent a gunboat out
to come and arrest us.

658
00:44:07,399 --> 00:44:09,629
The Varadero
had pulled some strings.

659
00:44:09,701 --> 00:44:12,363
With so much money
in the fin industry,

660
00:44:12,437 --> 00:44:14,803
and much of it
on the black market,

661
00:44:14,873 --> 00:44:16,966
we knew something
had gone terribly wrong.

662
00:44:20,045 --> 00:44:22,275
Lives have been lost
over shark fins

663
00:44:22,347 --> 00:44:26,283
and we had no interest
in battling a Guatemalan gunboat.

664
00:44:26,351 --> 00:44:28,683
So we ditched the Varadero,

665
00:44:28,753 --> 00:44:31,017
and continued south
to Costa Rica.

666
00:44:33,091 --> 00:44:35,889
- The United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organization,

667
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:39,487
based in Rome,
is really the top UN body,

668
00:44:39,564 --> 00:44:42,556
the top international body
that deals with fisheries;

669
00:44:42,634 --> 00:44:46,126
they don't have
any rule-making authority

670
00:44:46,204 --> 00:44:47,933
over the international waters.

671
00:44:48,006 --> 00:44:50,201
Guess what? No one does.

672
00:44:50,275 --> 00:44:52,937
So until the countries of the world
come together

673
00:44:53,011 --> 00:44:56,343
to create some kind of body
that can actually make rules

674
00:44:56,413 --> 00:44:58,040
over the catch limits

675
00:44:58,115 --> 00:45:00,606
and conservation
for the deep seas,

676
00:45:00,684 --> 00:45:04,347
they're not going to be regulated
in any effective way.

677
00:45:04,421 --> 00:45:07,822
It's just basically
a hunting-and-gathering operation,

678
00:45:07,891 --> 00:45:10,553
and, in fact,
a pure exploitive operation,

679
00:45:10,627 --> 00:45:14,256
with people just taking
and not giving anything back.

680
00:45:14,331 --> 00:45:20,895
- Imagine if you went into the forest
and laid down some kind of trap line

681
00:45:20,971 --> 00:45:24,463
that caught, you know,
moose, deer, skunks, porcupines,

682
00:45:24,541 --> 00:45:25,599
squirrels, dogs,

683
00:45:25,676 --> 00:45:28,975
you know,
caught all these species -

684
00:45:29,046 --> 00:45:31,537
when really what you were only after
was one or two,

685
00:45:31,615 --> 00:45:34,345
or perhaps three or four,
but you had all these other species

686
00:45:34,418 --> 00:45:35,976
that were caught,
or dying or dead.

687
00:45:37,387 --> 00:45:39,981
I mean,
clearly it wouldn't last a day.

688
00:45:41,692 --> 00:45:43,124
I mean, you know,

689
00:45:43,192 --> 00:45:46,252
nobody could put a trap line down
for 30 miles

690
00:45:46,329 --> 00:45:50,026
and throw away half the animals
he or she killed or caught.

691
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:52,363
Nobody would tolerate it
for a minute,

692
00:45:52,435 --> 00:45:56,701
but it's going on out there
on a massive scale every day.

693
00:45:58,641 --> 00:46:00,734
Oh

694
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:02,971
Can't anybody see

695
00:46:08,317 --> 00:46:10,945
we've got a war to fight

696
00:46:13,823 --> 00:46:16,291
Never found our way

697
00:46:17,994 --> 00:46:21,953
Regardless of what they say

698
00:46:23,666 --> 00:46:28,626
How can it feel this wrong

699
00:46:33,008 --> 00:46:34,942
From this moment

700
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:41,313
How can it feel this wrong

701
00:47:01,636 --> 00:47:05,197
How can it feel

702
00:47:05,273 --> 00:47:07,639
This wrong

703
00:47:14,316 --> 00:47:15,613
From this moment

704
00:47:15,684 --> 00:47:20,279
How can it feel

705
00:47:20,354 --> 00:47:22,686
This wrong

706
00:47:27,728 --> 00:47:31,220
- When we got to Costa Rica,
we were all over the news.

707
00:47:31,298 --> 00:47:34,631
The crew of the Varadero,
the illegal shark-fishing boat,

708
00:47:34,702 --> 00:47:37,398
claimed that we tried to kill them.

709
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,769
Okay.

710
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,331
I don't know what this is, either.

711
00:47:42,409 --> 00:47:45,071
- You know... you know what this?
- I don't know what it is.

712
00:47:45,145 --> 00:47:47,204
- Yeah, uh...
- It's the order.

713
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:49,215
It's the order of the judge,

714
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,774
it's the official order
to come on board

715
00:47:51,852 --> 00:47:53,114
and to make...

716
00:47:53,187 --> 00:47:57,920
- We were charged
with seven counts of attempted murder.

717
00:47:57,992 --> 00:48:00,460
- Crowded in here.
- We do what we normally do,

718
00:48:00,527 --> 00:48:02,722
and the tapes went to Canada
for processing.

719
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:05,959
- They were after Paul
because he's the captain of the boat,

720
00:48:06,033 --> 00:48:09,433
and me because I filmed it

721
00:48:09,502 --> 00:48:11,595
and they wanted my footage.

722
00:48:11,671 --> 00:48:14,868
Do you have any form
to get your original information

723
00:48:14,941 --> 00:48:16,670
since the beginning
of this situation?

724
00:48:16,743 --> 00:48:18,370
Do I have any way to get that?

725
00:48:18,444 --> 00:48:19,911
- Yeah.
- No.

726
00:48:19,979 --> 00:48:23,437
- Someone else got it?
- Someone else has it.

727
00:48:23,516 --> 00:48:24,847
Okay...

728
00:48:24,918 --> 00:48:26,783
Arrest?

729
00:48:26,853 --> 00:48:28,252
Did you ask them?

730
00:48:28,321 --> 00:48:30,755
Can I ask them? Yeah, probably.

731
00:48:30,823 --> 00:48:32,290
What you have to do,

732
00:48:32,358 --> 00:48:35,794
you have to call them by phone
or what?

733
00:48:35,862 --> 00:48:38,922
- Uh, yeah.
- Could you call them, right now?

734
00:48:38,998 --> 00:48:40,431
- Right now?
- Yeah.

735
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,559
It's important
to get that information.

736
00:48:42,635 --> 00:48:43,932
It's better...

737
00:48:44,003 --> 00:48:47,097
They set the fishing boat free...

738
00:48:47,173 --> 00:48:49,801
and we were being arrested

739
00:48:49,876 --> 00:48:54,370
And, uh, we have all of the law,
in all of Costa Rica here,

740
00:48:54,447 --> 00:48:55,879
talking to us.

741
00:48:55,948 --> 00:48:57,472
They want to see...

742
00:48:57,549 --> 00:49:00,541
- They're totally blank,
there's no pictures on them yet.

743
00:49:00,619 --> 00:49:03,486
- You sure they're not in here?
- Yeah.

744
00:49:03,555 --> 00:49:05,489
Not everyone's gonna fit;

745
00:49:05,557 --> 00:49:08,856
there's about this much room
in the whole room.

746
00:49:08,927 --> 00:49:12,454
It didn't make any sense
why they were arresting us

747
00:49:12,531 --> 00:49:15,125
and ignoring the fishing boat.

748
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,067
We were invited here
by the President of the country

749
00:49:18,136 --> 00:49:20,070
to protect Cocos
from illegal fishing.

750
00:49:20,138 --> 00:49:22,732
What do you think
they're gonna do?

751
00:49:22,808 --> 00:49:24,867
I have no idea;

752
00:49:24,943 --> 00:49:27,002
I don't think they know
what they're doing.

753
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:30,571
What kind of weapons
do you have on the boat?

754
00:49:30,649 --> 00:49:32,310
A shotgun.

755
00:49:32,384 --> 00:49:33,646
Can we see them?

756
00:49:33,719 --> 00:49:35,277
Oh, yeah, sure.

757
00:49:35,354 --> 00:49:37,083
There's just one.

758
00:49:37,155 --> 00:49:39,453
Yeah,
but there's one that's...

759
00:49:40,993 --> 00:49:43,460
- It wasn't an issue
between two boats anymore.

760
00:49:45,096 --> 00:49:48,554
They were going to stop us
from protecting sharks.

761
00:49:55,239 --> 00:49:57,230
The authorities left us
under house arrest,

762
00:49:57,308 --> 00:49:59,936
but we had to fight the charges
in court.

763
00:50:03,014 --> 00:50:05,414
Questions
I need to know is, one:

764
00:50:05,483 --> 00:50:07,883
What are the chances
of them seizing the ship,

765
00:50:07,952 --> 00:50:10,443
and what are the chances
of them arresting me, today?

766
00:50:10,521 --> 00:50:11,988
- We were summoned
to the courthouse,

767
00:50:12,056 --> 00:50:13,785
where we met with Milton,
our lawyer,

768
00:50:13,858 --> 00:50:17,419
to figure out our options
and try and find a way out of this.

769
00:50:17,495 --> 00:50:20,726
- How come everybody's ignoring
that the Varadero,

770
00:50:20,798 --> 00:50:23,631
one: Violated Guatemalan law,
Costa Rican law,

771
00:50:23,701 --> 00:50:27,262
and international law,
and we have the evidence on that.

772
00:50:27,338 --> 00:50:29,806
They cannot take sharks
for fins alone,

773
00:50:29,874 --> 00:50:32,000
they cannot fish
in Guatemalan waters,

774
00:50:32,075 --> 00:50:34,543
they cannot fish
outside of Costa Rica

775
00:50:34,611 --> 00:50:36,772
without a permit.
That's illegal!

776
00:50:36,846 --> 00:50:38,313
Everybody's ignoring that.

777
00:50:38,381 --> 00:50:39,973
Paul's been in this situation before,

778
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:43,315
and he knows we're in big trouble
if we don't fight back.

779
00:50:43,386 --> 00:50:46,355
- Well, the fact is, if we were
in any Central American country

780
00:50:46,423 --> 00:50:49,256
other than Costa Rica,
we wouldn't even try this.

781
00:50:49,325 --> 00:50:52,988
One other thing: If they have a trial,
is it in Puntarenas;

782
00:50:53,063 --> 00:50:57,056
and if they have a trial,
is it a jury or a judge?

783
00:50:57,133 --> 00:50:59,294
- Three judges.
- Three judges?

784
00:50:59,369 --> 00:51:02,099
- Yes
- Is it in Puntarenas?

785
00:51:02,172 --> 00:51:04,572
Oh, geez,
you don't have a chance there.

786
00:51:04,641 --> 00:51:08,099
But I find it amazing
that the Costa Rican judicial system

787
00:51:08,178 --> 00:51:11,614
is coming at us so viciously

788
00:51:11,681 --> 00:51:15,276
when what they're defending
is an illegal fishing operation.

789
00:51:15,351 --> 00:51:17,410
And, of course, when you see

790
00:51:17,487 --> 00:51:20,250
the number of long-liners
that are operating,

791
00:51:20,322 --> 00:51:23,086
including Taiwanese long-liners
operating in Costa Rica;

792
00:51:23,158 --> 00:51:25,285
and the judicial system
in Puntarenas,

793
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,921
they are certainly not interested
in anything to do with illegal fishing,

794
00:51:28,997 --> 00:51:31,966
but they seem to be very determined
to stop anybody

795
00:51:32,034 --> 00:51:34,434
who's going to interfere
with illegal fishing.

796
00:51:36,171 --> 00:51:37,934
Then I met William,

797
00:51:38,006 --> 00:51:40,201
a conservationist who believed
that the authorities

798
00:51:40,275 --> 00:51:42,800
were being paid out
by the Taiwanese Mafia,

799
00:51:42,878 --> 00:51:47,042
who ran the shark-fishing business
in Costa Rica.

800
00:51:47,116 --> 00:51:50,381
Finning sharks is illegal
in Costa Rica,

801
00:51:50,452 --> 00:51:52,420
but huge shipments
of Costa Rican fins

802
00:51:52,488 --> 00:51:54,217
were turning up all over Asia

803
00:51:54,289 --> 00:51:55,779
and no one knew how.

804
00:51:55,858 --> 00:51:58,326
William believed
that the Taiwanese

805
00:51:58,393 --> 00:51:59,917
had private docks

806
00:51:59,995 --> 00:52:02,623
where no one would know
if they were finning sharks.

807
00:52:04,199 --> 00:52:06,827
I needed to know
if William was right,

808
00:52:06,902 --> 00:52:08,869
if they were really finning sharks.

809
00:52:08,936 --> 00:52:12,963
So we broke house arrest
and went undercover into town.

810
00:52:14,642 --> 00:52:18,840
In all our time filming sharks,
we've never been so scared.

811
00:52:20,348 --> 00:52:22,612
There was a whole street
of shark-fishing operations

812
00:52:22,683 --> 00:52:24,173
along a secluded bay,

813
00:52:24,252 --> 00:52:25,981
all with private docks.

814
00:52:32,693 --> 00:52:35,787
These plants process,
pack and distribute shark fins

815
00:52:35,863 --> 00:52:38,957
coming mostly
from Costa Rica and Ecuador.

816
00:52:39,033 --> 00:52:42,161
They dry the fins on the roof,

817
00:52:42,236 --> 00:52:45,069
behind huge cement walls,
so no one can see them.

818
00:52:45,139 --> 00:52:48,131
Virtually all of the fins
are shipped to Asia,

819
00:52:48,209 --> 00:52:50,200
making it out of Costa Rica

820
00:52:50,278 --> 00:52:51,939
without being noticed.

821
00:52:56,283 --> 00:52:59,719
This operation had fins from nearly
a dozen different species of sharks.

822
00:53:09,162 --> 00:53:13,997
There were millions of dollars in fins
and dozens of illegal operations

823
00:53:14,067 --> 00:53:16,900
that the authorities
must have known about,

824
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:18,961
all controlled
by big business in Asia.

825
00:53:25,612 --> 00:53:29,173
The fins were bringing Costa Rica
millions of dollars

826
00:53:29,249 --> 00:53:32,013
and we were trying to stop it.

827
00:53:32,085 --> 00:53:35,316
Now I knew
why we were being arrested

828
00:53:35,388 --> 00:53:38,653
and I knew
we were in serious trouble.

829
00:53:56,342 --> 00:53:59,470
I couldn't believe
how big the shark-fin trade was,

830
00:53:59,545 --> 00:54:02,173
especially in a country
that depends on ecotourism.

831
00:54:03,649 --> 00:54:05,549
At another fin operation,
I found a trailer

832
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:07,813
sitting next to the building
and climbed on top

833
00:54:07,886 --> 00:54:11,253
to film the fins in broad daylight.

834
00:54:11,323 --> 00:54:13,314
There were at least 10,000 fins

835
00:54:13,392 --> 00:54:16,293
drying on the roof,
and the employees ran out,

836
00:54:16,362 --> 00:54:19,297
trying to push the fins
out of sight of my camera.

837
00:54:22,334 --> 00:54:24,802
Then they stormed out of the building
and headed straight for us,

838
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:29,136
so we jumped into William's car
and took off.

839
00:54:29,208 --> 00:54:30,937
The corruption was real;

840
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:34,945
we'd uncovered a huge
illegal-fin industry in Costa Rica

841
00:54:35,013 --> 00:54:37,208
that the authorities ignored.

842
00:54:37,282 --> 00:54:39,307
Taiwan donated
millions of dollars

843
00:54:39,384 --> 00:54:41,818
to Puntarenas -
building major highways,

844
00:54:41,886 --> 00:54:45,151
bridges and buildings -
and they didn't want any interference.

845
00:54:48,826 --> 00:54:51,386
One hundred million sharks
are killed each year

846
00:54:51,462 --> 00:54:53,862
to support a billion-dollar
shark-fin industry

847
00:54:53,931 --> 00:54:55,922
that Costa Rica was profiting from.

848
00:54:59,804 --> 00:55:01,931
I knew we were in serious trouble.

849
00:55:03,308 --> 00:55:05,902
We'd be lucky
to get out of Costa Rica.

850
00:55:09,747 --> 00:55:12,978
William told me
not to go back into town;

851
00:55:13,051 --> 00:55:16,282
the shark-fin Mafia
would be looking for me.

852
00:55:19,656 --> 00:55:22,989
Oh Sinnerman
where you gonna run to

853
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:26,291
Sinnerman
where you gonna run to

854
00:55:27,331 --> 00:55:29,231
where you gonna run to

855
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:31,931
All along dem day

856
00:55:32,002 --> 00:55:34,061
well / run to the rock

857
00:55:34,137 --> 00:55:36,935
Please hide me
/ run to the rock...

858
00:55:37,007 --> 00:55:38,736
When we got back on the boat,

859
00:55:38,809 --> 00:55:41,073
we heard from our lawyer
that the Coast Guard

860
00:55:41,144 --> 00:55:44,511
was on their way to arrest us
and we would be detained indefinitely.

861
00:55:53,457 --> 00:55:56,722
We had to get out of there,
so we pulled anchor

862
00:55:56,793 --> 00:55:59,387
and made a break
for international waters.

863
00:55:59,463 --> 00:56:01,727
/ said rock

864
00:56:01,798 --> 00:56:04,232
what's a matter with you rock

865
00:56:04,301 --> 00:56:06,792
- I think it's heading this way.
- How fast? 10?

866
00:56:08,804 --> 00:56:10,396
Within minutes,

867
00:56:10,473 --> 00:56:12,873
the Coast Guard was chasing us
with machine guns,

868
00:56:12,942 --> 00:56:15,911
telling us that they will shoot
if we don't stop.

869
00:56:15,978 --> 00:56:19,141
/t was bleedin'
/ run to the sea

870
00:56:19,215 --> 00:56:24,175
/t was bleedin' / run to the sea
/t was bleedin'

871
00:56:24,253 --> 00:56:27,381
- I don't like guys waving machine guns,
demanding to come on board.

872
00:56:27,456 --> 00:56:31,119
No, just the barbed wire right now.
It'll make it difficult for them...

873
00:56:31,193 --> 00:56:33,024
But we knew we couldn't stop.

874
00:56:33,095 --> 00:56:35,620
So we strung barbed wire
around the sides of the ship,

875
00:56:35,698 --> 00:56:39,896
so the Coast Guard couldn't
jump on board, and kept running.

876
00:56:39,969 --> 00:56:42,028
We're not stopping.

877
00:56:43,305 --> 00:56:45,296
Please hide me Lord

878
00:56:45,374 --> 00:56:49,834
Don't you see me prayin'

879
00:56:49,912 --> 00:56:52,779
Don't you see me
down here prayin'

880
00:56:52,848 --> 00:56:56,283
- Tell everybody to be very careful
if those guys got guns.

881
00:56:56,351 --> 00:56:59,218
If they shoot,
they're gonna be really stupid.

882
00:57:00,622 --> 00:57:02,214
Well, tell 'em to shoot.

883
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:05,020
We're not stopping.
He said go to the devil

884
00:57:05,093 --> 00:57:07,561
All along dem day

885
00:57:07,629 --> 00:57:09,358
So / ran to the devil

886
00:57:09,431 --> 00:57:13,094
He was waitin'
/ ran to the devil

887
00:57:13,168 --> 00:57:16,103
He was waitin'
Ran to the devil

888
00:57:16,171 --> 00:57:19,504
He was waitin'
We did everything right,

889
00:57:19,574 --> 00:57:21,735
we did everything
we were told to do.

890
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:23,744
Uh, what do they want to do?

891
00:57:23,812 --> 00:57:25,871
Start another international incident
over this?

892
00:57:27,482 --> 00:57:30,007
Tell 'em we have to call our lawyer.

893
00:57:30,084 --> 00:57:34,214
See if we can call Milton on the radio
and tell him they're chasing us.

894
00:57:34,289 --> 00:57:36,849
Sinnerman you oughta be prayin'

895
00:57:39,093 --> 00:57:42,654
Oughta be prayin' Sinnerman

896
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:44,788
Oughta be prayin'

897
00:57:44,865 --> 00:57:46,298
All on that day

898
00:57:46,366 --> 00:57:48,334
/ cried power

899
00:57:48,402 --> 00:57:49,892
Power

900
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:53,531
Power
Power

901
00:57:53,607 --> 00:57:56,201
- Finally, we made it out
of Costa Rican waters

902
00:57:56,276 --> 00:57:58,403
and the Coast Guard stopped.

903
00:58:05,752 --> 00:58:07,413
We continued southwest

904
00:58:07,488 --> 00:58:09,012
to the Galapagos,

905
00:58:09,089 --> 00:58:11,683
leaving Cocos to the poachers.

906
00:58:11,758 --> 00:58:14,386
The fins were worth
too much money

907
00:58:14,461 --> 00:58:17,328
and there was a whole industry
behind it.

908
00:58:17,397 --> 00:58:20,594
We knew we could never go back
to Costa Rica.

909
00:58:28,475 --> 00:58:29,942
Four days from Costa Rica

910
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:32,443
and 800 miles later,

911
00:58:32,512 --> 00:58:35,606
we arrived
in the Galapagos Islands.

912
00:58:35,681 --> 00:58:38,241
Sea Shepherd was invited
by the national park

913
00:58:38,317 --> 00:58:41,115
to protect the marine reserve
from illegal fishing

914
00:58:41,187 --> 00:58:44,054
and we were making our way
through the archipelago

915
00:58:44,123 --> 00:58:46,887
to the main town of Santa Cruz,

916
00:58:46,959 --> 00:58:49,291
where we would meet with the navy

917
00:58:49,362 --> 00:58:51,057
who control the park.

918
00:58:53,933 --> 00:58:57,061
Although the Galapagos
is a marine reserve,

919
00:58:57,136 --> 00:58:58,831
some fishing has always
been allowed

920
00:58:58,905 --> 00:59:00,896
to provide the island residents
with food.

921
00:59:03,042 --> 00:59:04,976
The fishermen soon realized

922
00:59:05,044 --> 00:59:07,808
that their underwater treasure
was worth a fortune

923
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:10,610
and started
shipping their catch overseas.

924
00:59:10,683 --> 00:59:13,379
The government noticed
and started imposing quotas

925
00:59:13,452 --> 00:59:15,818
to protect the resource,

926
00:59:15,888 --> 00:59:18,288
but the fishermen rioted,

927
00:59:18,357 --> 00:59:20,051
destroying national-park offices,

928
00:59:20,125 --> 00:59:22,320
holding national-park officials
hostage,

929
00:59:22,394 --> 00:59:26,296
and threatening to kill
the last giant tortoises.

930
00:59:26,364 --> 00:59:28,889
The government gave in

931
00:59:28,967 --> 00:59:30,958
and raised the quotas.

932
00:59:58,863 --> 01:00:02,128
- Ecuador is on the side
of conserving the Galapagos,

933
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:05,601
but laws written down
and laws applied

934
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:08,797
are something very different.

935
01:00:08,872 --> 01:00:12,205
And one of the problems
with the extraction of resources

936
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:15,973
is that we really often don't understand
how ecosystems work.

937
01:00:17,348 --> 01:00:18,838
At this present moment,

938
01:00:18,916 --> 01:00:22,613
sharks are protected
within the marine reserve.

939
01:00:22,686 --> 01:00:25,484
It is not legal to take sharks.

940
01:00:27,558 --> 01:00:32,495
One of the very strong pressures
at this time in Galapagos

941
01:00:32,563 --> 01:00:34,793
is to open long-lining.

942
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:39,658
Then you're really talking
about a shark fishery.

943
01:00:42,172 --> 01:00:44,299
We know relatively little

944
01:00:44,375 --> 01:00:48,243
about the general ecology
of the ocean

945
01:00:48,312 --> 01:00:50,542
and to risk removing

946
01:00:50,614 --> 01:00:53,583
a large number of predators
from the area

947
01:00:53,651 --> 01:00:55,585
may have consequences

948
01:00:55,653 --> 01:00:58,416
which we have
absolutely no concept of.

949
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:11,627
Shark finning is a very profitable
and cheap way

950
01:01:11,701 --> 01:01:14,534
to make a lot of money,

951
01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:18,938
and it has the similar sort of ring,
financially,

952
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:20,805
to sea cucumbers.

953
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:26,508
And even
with the humble sea cucumber,

954
01:01:26,582 --> 01:01:28,482
we're already changing situations.

955
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:36,450
I doubt very much
there'll be a sea-cucumber industry,

956
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:39,324
simply because
the resource is gone.

957
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:47,667
- A few men from some
of the cucumber fishing boats -

958
01:01:47,736 --> 01:01:50,068
they're actually
fishing here illegally -

959
01:01:50,138 --> 01:01:53,369
just came up to our boat
to ask if we had any advice,

960
01:01:53,442 --> 01:01:55,910
because they had two of their fishermen
that were bent.

961
01:01:55,977 --> 01:01:58,002
One man had been bent
for four days,

962
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,775
he'd had severe pain
in his shoulders

963
01:01:59,848 --> 01:02:02,840
and it hasn't gone away;
another guy got bent today.

964
01:02:02,918 --> 01:02:05,682
He went back down,
did some in-water recompression,

965
01:02:05,754 --> 01:02:07,619
came back up and feels fine.

966
01:02:07,689 --> 01:02:10,123
If he's been bent four days
and has severe problems

967
01:02:10,192 --> 01:02:12,422
in his shoulder,
he needs to get into a chamber.

968
01:02:12,494 --> 01:02:15,986
The bends is a disease
caused by diving too deep

969
01:02:16,064 --> 01:02:17,998
and surfacing quickly.

970
01:02:18,066 --> 01:02:20,398
It's incredibly painful
and you can die

971
01:02:20,469 --> 01:02:23,131
if you don't get
to a recompression chamber.

972
01:02:23,205 --> 01:02:27,266
If someone's paying them
to go diving for cucumbers,

973
01:02:27,342 --> 01:02:30,175
someone should be able
to pay to take them back

974
01:02:30,245 --> 01:02:32,508
to Santa Cruz
to get to a chamber.

975
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:34,445
Because he's really sick.

976
01:02:34,515 --> 01:02:36,983
He could die
if he doesn't get to a chamber.

977
01:02:40,054 --> 01:02:43,785
But the problem is,
they have 12 days left of fishing,

978
01:02:43,858 --> 01:02:47,658
so they don't want to go back
to Santa Cruz to go to the chamber.

979
01:02:47,728 --> 01:02:50,196
Lose four days of fishing,

980
01:02:50,264 --> 01:02:52,255
or lose your man?

981
01:02:54,969 --> 01:02:58,200
The cucumbers were worth more
than the lives of the fisherman.

982
01:03:00,741 --> 01:03:02,572
With the cucumbers nearly gone,

983
01:03:02,643 --> 01:03:05,908
the fishermen are pushing
to legalize long-lining,

984
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:08,540
which catches mostly sharks.

985
01:03:08,616 --> 01:03:11,710
Sharks have always been protected
in the Galapagos.

986
01:03:11,786 --> 01:03:14,380
Now that Costa Rica
was finning sharks,

987
01:03:14,455 --> 01:03:17,788
the Galapagos is one
of the last strongholds for sharks.

988
01:03:20,094 --> 01:03:21,788
Legalizing long-lining here

989
01:03:21,861 --> 01:03:24,955
would wipe out
more than just sharks.

990
01:03:25,031 --> 01:03:27,898
Every animal and ecosystem
in the Galapagos

991
01:03:27,967 --> 01:03:30,435
depends on the ocean
for survival.

992
01:03:40,013 --> 01:03:41,947
Sharks have a really tough time

993
01:03:42,015 --> 01:03:44,415
catching seals and sea lions.

994
01:03:44,484 --> 01:03:47,317
They shaped these animals,
putting pressure on them

995
01:03:47,387 --> 01:03:49,912
so they evolved ways
of avoiding sharks.

996
01:03:53,326 --> 01:03:55,851
The seal evolved
hyper-mobile backbones,

997
01:03:55,929 --> 01:03:59,228
making them extremely agile
in the water

998
01:03:59,299 --> 01:04:01,096
and a difficult target for sharks.

999
01:04:02,802 --> 01:04:05,930
The sharks have to ambush the seals
or find an injured one.

1000
01:04:07,307 --> 01:04:09,570
To ambush a seal,
they swim below,

1001
01:04:09,641 --> 01:04:11,336
out of visible range,

1002
01:04:11,410 --> 01:04:14,902
looking for the silhouette
of a seal -

1003
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:19,280
a very similar silhouette
to a human on the surface.

1004
01:04:19,751 --> 01:04:22,219
A healthy seal
moves through the water

1005
01:04:22,287 --> 01:04:24,084
without any noise or bubbles.

1006
01:04:24,156 --> 01:04:26,215
But an injured one
will flail about,

1007
01:04:26,291 --> 01:04:28,088
creating a disturbance
in the water,

1008
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:32,096
just like humans when we swim.

1009
01:04:32,164 --> 01:04:35,793
It's amazing how few people
are attacked each year,

1010
01:04:35,868 --> 01:04:38,769
considering how much
we look like shark food.

1011
01:04:38,837 --> 01:04:41,237
- We treat animals differently,
but they're all doing the same thing.

1012
01:04:41,306 --> 01:04:44,366
So the cute little baby harp seal
grows up and goes out and eats fish,

1013
01:04:44,443 --> 01:04:46,809
just as viciously as a shark.

1014
01:04:46,879 --> 01:04:49,871
But we think of the seal
as sort of cute and cuddly,

1015
01:04:49,948 --> 01:04:52,178
and we think of the shark
as something vicious,

1016
01:04:52,251 --> 01:04:53,741
but that's just human mythology.

1017
01:05:26,117 --> 01:05:28,415
Then my mission stopped cold,

1018
01:05:28,486 --> 01:05:31,944
I had a pain in my leg
and was taken to the hospital.

1019
01:05:33,491 --> 01:05:35,982
It was diagnosed
as flesh-eating disease.

1020
01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:38,927
Doctors said
I was lucky to be alive,

1021
01:05:38,996 --> 01:05:41,191
that I would only lose my leg.

1022
01:05:43,634 --> 01:05:47,000
I had a pain in my lymph gland
to the right of -

1023
01:05:47,070 --> 01:05:48,799
to the left of my groin -

1024
01:05:48,872 --> 01:05:52,171
and I came to the hospital,
asked them what's wrong;

1025
01:05:52,242 --> 01:05:56,906
they said I got Staphylococcal
bacteria in my leg.

1026
01:05:56,980 --> 01:06:00,279
Staphylococcus,
or flesh-eating disease,

1027
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:02,409
infects the body through any wound,

1028
01:06:02,485 --> 01:06:06,751
even a tiny cut,
like the ones I had on my feet.

1029
01:06:06,823 --> 01:06:10,088
It destroys tissue,
consuming the body,

1030
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:13,425
and if untreated, can kill you.

1031
01:06:17,267 --> 01:06:20,430
I was hospitalized,
fighting to save my leg.

1032
01:06:22,472 --> 01:06:25,236
Watching the IV
of antibiotics and saline solution

1033
01:06:25,308 --> 01:06:27,208
drip into my arm.

1034
01:06:27,277 --> 01:06:30,678
Now that I couldn't be
in the ocean,

1035
01:06:30,747 --> 01:06:33,408
they were dripping the ocean
into me.

1036
01:06:36,151 --> 01:06:38,585
I'll be fine, okay?

1037
01:06:38,654 --> 01:06:40,747
I promise.

1038
01:06:40,823 --> 01:06:44,281
I lay there, watching the red line
creep up my leg.

1039
01:06:45,694 --> 01:06:49,721
It was halfway through my thigh
and if it made it to my hip,

1040
01:06:49,798 --> 01:06:52,892
I would lose more than my leg.

1041
01:06:54,937 --> 01:06:57,872
I'm probably way more likely
to die working in Toronto than here.

1042
01:07:04,146 --> 01:07:07,741
Dude... Brian, don't get stressed
and don't get upset, okay?

1043
01:07:09,284 --> 01:07:13,186
It's fine, it's just...
it's just another bump, alright?

1044
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:17,124
Then I heard from Paul.

1045
01:07:17,192 --> 01:07:19,854
He said there was nothing
they could do,

1046
01:07:19,928 --> 01:07:23,363
Sea Shepherd was being
kicked out of the Galapagos...

1047
01:07:25,967 --> 01:07:29,425
...because the Galapagos
had legalized long-lining.

1048
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:34,975
The fishermen wanted more money
and had turned to shark fins.

1049
01:07:35,043 --> 01:07:37,568
The government gave in,

1050
01:07:37,645 --> 01:07:40,808
and long-lining was legalized.

1051
01:07:41,749 --> 01:07:44,309
Now we've lost Cocos
and the Galapagos

1052
01:07:44,385 --> 01:07:46,376
to the fin industry.

1053
01:07:47,922 --> 01:07:51,016
I think the world needs to know

1054
01:07:51,092 --> 01:07:52,889
that sharks are probably

1055
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:55,428
the most threatened
group of species

1056
01:07:55,496 --> 01:07:58,863
that we have
in the ocean right now.

1057
01:07:58,933 --> 01:08:01,993
And that a lot of shark species
are declining very rapidly;

1058
01:08:02,070 --> 01:08:04,937
that this is not
a natural phenomenon.

1059
01:08:05,006 --> 01:08:08,703
It's because of fishing
and other human impacts

1060
01:08:08,776 --> 01:08:14,577
and that there's a lot we can do
about this to change it.

1061
01:08:16,683 --> 01:08:19,846
- Sharks are going to be difficult
to conserve,

1062
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:23,879
because on one hand,
you have people afraid of them

1063
01:08:23,957 --> 01:08:27,586
and not really wanting
to go anywhere near them.

1064
01:08:27,661 --> 01:08:30,221
People can sort of fish them
with impunity.

1065
01:08:30,297 --> 01:08:32,561
There's nobody
looking after the sharks.

1066
01:08:32,632 --> 01:08:34,395
There's no campaign,

1067
01:08:34,468 --> 01:08:36,231
like a Greenpeace campaign,

1068
01:08:36,303 --> 01:08:38,100
to save the sharks.

1069
01:10:40,624 --> 01:10:43,286
Paul left to start a campaign

1070
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:46,386
against illegal whaling
in Antarctica.

1071
01:10:46,730 --> 01:10:48,925
And I was alone.

1072
01:10:50,867 --> 01:10:54,030
Two of the world's
last sanctuaries for sharks

1073
01:10:54,104 --> 01:10:56,231
were going to be wiped out.

1074
01:10:56,306 --> 01:10:59,070
During my last six days
in the hospital,

1075
01:10:59,142 --> 01:11:02,270
more than 1.5 million sharks
had been killed.

1076
01:11:03,647 --> 01:11:06,207
Everyone told me to go home,

1077
01:11:06,283 --> 01:11:07,511
forget about sharks,

1078
01:11:07,584 --> 01:11:10,178
and try and save my leg.

1079
01:11:10,254 --> 01:11:14,520
I didn't know if what I was doing
made sense anymore,

1080
01:11:14,591 --> 01:11:16,684
but all I could think about

1081
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:18,887
was getting back underwater
with sharks.

1082
01:11:24,367 --> 01:11:27,268
Sharks' presence in the ocean
has provided a framework

1083
01:11:27,336 --> 01:11:29,600
for the populations below them,

1084
01:11:29,672 --> 01:11:31,299
including phytoplankton,

1085
01:11:31,374 --> 01:11:34,343
tiny aquatic plants
that consume more carbon dioxide

1086
01:11:34,410 --> 01:11:36,173
than anything else on Earth.

1087
01:11:36,245 --> 01:11:38,975
Carbon dioxide
is the global-warming gas,

1088
01:11:39,048 --> 01:11:41,380
and plankton converts it to oxygen,

1089
01:11:41,450 --> 01:11:45,045
providing 70º/º of the oxygen
we breathe on land.

1090
01:11:45,121 --> 01:11:47,021
Without sharks to prey on them,

1091
01:11:47,089 --> 01:11:49,956
plankton feeders below sharks
could grow out of control,

1092
01:11:50,026 --> 01:11:52,927
consuming the plankton
that we depend on for survival.

1093
01:11:54,463 --> 01:11:57,023
The ocean
is the most important ecosystem,

1094
01:11:57,099 --> 01:12:01,195
regulating climate
and feeding much of the planet.

1095
01:12:01,270 --> 01:12:04,603
Life on land
depends on life in the ocean.

1096
01:12:05,775 --> 01:12:09,835
I finally realized
that it's not just about saving sharks,

1097
01:12:09,911 --> 01:12:12,675
it's about saving ourselves.

1098
01:12:15,650 --> 01:12:18,744
There was nothing I could do
to save sharks in the Galapagos,

1099
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:21,983
but shark finning
was still illegal in Costa Rica.

1100
01:12:22,057 --> 01:12:24,525
If I could get back
into Costa Rica,

1101
01:12:24,592 --> 01:12:26,719
maybe I could finally
get to Cocos

1102
01:12:26,795 --> 01:12:28,956
and do something
to stop the finning.

1103
01:12:30,498 --> 01:12:33,262
I lay there,
hoping the red line would stop,

1104
01:12:33,335 --> 01:12:35,803
and after a week it did.

1105
01:12:36,638 --> 01:12:40,199
The infection subsided
and I was finally free.

1106
01:12:41,910 --> 01:12:43,639
I think the problem is,

1107
01:12:43,712 --> 01:12:46,875
that we don't really understand
what we are.

1108
01:12:46,948 --> 01:12:50,247
In essence,
we're, uh, you know,

1109
01:12:50,318 --> 01:12:52,684
just a conceited naked ape,

1110
01:12:52,754 --> 01:12:55,882
but in our minds
we're some sort of divine legend

1111
01:12:55,957 --> 01:12:59,551
and we see ourselves
as some sort of god,

1112
01:12:59,626 --> 01:13:04,029
that we can walk around the Earth
deciding who will live and who will die,

1113
01:13:04,098 --> 01:13:06,999
and what will be destroyed
and what will be saved.

1114
01:13:07,067 --> 01:13:11,197
But the fact is, we're just a bunch
of primates out of control.

1115
01:13:30,791 --> 01:13:33,692
We're now in the midst
of a Third World War,

1116
01:13:33,761 --> 01:13:35,592
but this time
the enemy is ourselves

1117
01:13:35,662 --> 01:13:38,825
and the objective is to save
the planet from ourselves.

1118
01:13:38,899 --> 01:13:41,766
There is no hope
for the masses of humanity

1119
01:13:41,835 --> 01:13:43,268
to do anything.

1120
01:13:43,337 --> 01:13:45,532
They never have, they never will.

1121
01:13:45,605 --> 01:13:49,507
All social change comes
from the passionate intervention

1122
01:13:49,575 --> 01:13:52,567
of individuals
or small groups of individuals.

1123
01:13:53,913 --> 01:13:57,110
Slavery wasn't ended
by any government or any institution.

1124
01:13:57,183 --> 01:13:59,947
Women got the right to vote

1125
01:14:00,019 --> 01:14:02,214
not because of any government.

1126
01:14:02,288 --> 01:14:06,691
The civil-rights movement,
the same thing -

1127
01:14:06,759 --> 01:14:10,695
India with Mahatma Gandhi,
South Africa with Nelson Mandela.

1128
01:14:10,763 --> 01:14:12,958
Again, it's always individuals.

1129
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:14,795
You need those individuals

1130
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:16,960
with the passion and the energy
to get involved.

1131
01:14:17,036 --> 01:14:18,765
In fact, I don't know

1132
01:14:18,838 --> 01:14:20,567
of any governments or institutions

1133
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,938
that are doing anything
to solve any of these problems.

1134
01:14:24,243 --> 01:14:26,973
All over the world, though,
I am seeing individuals

1135
01:14:27,046 --> 01:14:29,514
and non-government organizations
that are passionately involved

1136
01:14:29,582 --> 01:14:33,177
in protecting ecosystems
and species,

1137
01:14:33,252 --> 01:14:35,685
and that's where I see
some optimism,

1138
01:14:35,754 --> 01:14:37,779
that's where results
are happening.

1139
01:14:59,077 --> 01:15:00,442
Okay...

1140
01:15:00,512 --> 01:15:01,945
here we go.

1141
01:15:02,013 --> 01:15:05,380
As soon as I was let out
of the hospital,

1142
01:15:05,450 --> 01:15:08,510
I started making my way
back to Costa Rica.

1143
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:12,580
Costa Rica was the last place
on Earth I should go.

1144
01:15:12,657 --> 01:15:14,557
I would be arrested immediately

1145
01:15:14,626 --> 01:15:17,322
if they found out I was there.

1146
01:15:17,395 --> 01:15:19,886
So I had to sneak in.

1147
01:15:19,965 --> 01:15:22,432
I took a boat
from the Galapagos Islands

1148
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:24,058
to mainland Ecuador.

1149
01:15:24,134 --> 01:15:26,102
My friends in Costa Rica

1150
01:15:26,170 --> 01:15:29,333
told me not to fly back
into the country,

1151
01:15:29,406 --> 01:15:32,239
that I'd be caught if I did.

1152
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:38,171
I had to avoid any major ports,

1153
01:15:38,249 --> 01:15:40,581
the police and the Coast Guard.

1154
01:15:40,651 --> 01:15:42,812
Even if I made it to the coast,

1155
01:15:42,887 --> 01:15:45,617
I'd also have to avoid
the shark-fin Mafia.

1156
01:15:52,930 --> 01:15:54,557
To avoid capture,

1157
01:15:54,632 --> 01:15:56,532
I travelled overland for days,

1158
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,898
using public transportation
and tour buses

1159
01:15:58,969 --> 01:16:01,335
to get back into the country.

1160
01:16:01,405 --> 01:16:03,873
Still going, this bus?

1161
01:16:03,941 --> 01:16:07,206
I only narrowly escaped arrest
a few weeks earlier,

1162
01:16:07,278 --> 01:16:09,871
but I had to find a way in

1163
01:16:09,946 --> 01:16:12,574
and find a way
to help the sharks.

1164
01:16:18,955 --> 01:16:21,753
Avoiding arrest and staying
on public buses,

1165
01:16:21,824 --> 01:16:24,224
I made it to the coast

1166
01:16:24,294 --> 01:16:26,922
and entered Puntarenas.

1167
01:16:33,803 --> 01:16:37,705
Instead of the shark-fin Mafia
I was expecting to greet me,

1168
01:16:37,774 --> 01:16:40,436
there were protests
in the streets.

1169
01:16:42,178 --> 01:16:45,636
Costa Ricans were rallying
against shark finning.

1170
01:16:45,715 --> 01:16:48,775
The publicity surrounding our case
brought the shark-finning industry

1171
01:16:48,851 --> 01:16:50,341
into the spotlight.

1172
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:53,048
We hadn't totally failed
in saving sharks.

1173
01:16:54,724 --> 01:16:57,625
We helped awaken a country
and the people.

1174
01:16:59,161 --> 01:17:00,651
Costa Ricans were outraged;

1175
01:17:00,729 --> 01:17:04,290
they held protests
against the private docks

1176
01:17:04,366 --> 01:17:06,425
and spoke out
against the corruption.

1177
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:10,730
The world had started
rallying for sharks.

1178
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:27,655
The police were busy
with the protest

1179
01:17:27,723 --> 01:17:30,283
and the Mafia was in hiding.

1180
01:17:32,127 --> 01:17:35,426
Now I knew I could make it to Cocos
without getting caught.

1181
01:17:42,270 --> 01:17:45,467
I found my friends
and we headed back out to sea.

1182
01:18:02,723 --> 01:18:04,918
Returning underwater,

1183
01:18:04,992 --> 01:18:08,120
finally I could swim
with sharks again,

1184
01:18:08,195 --> 01:18:11,892
in one of the last places on Earth
where sharks thrive.

1185
01:18:14,435 --> 01:18:17,199
Free diving...

1186
01:18:17,271 --> 01:18:19,705
I hold my breath and stay calm

1187
01:18:19,774 --> 01:18:22,242
so they're not afraid of me.

1188
01:18:27,615 --> 01:18:29,947
Ever since I was a kid,

1189
01:18:30,017 --> 01:18:31,575
I've loved sharks.

1190
01:18:36,790 --> 01:18:39,054
They taught me about life,

1191
01:18:39,125 --> 01:18:42,458
and that fear
was something I made up,

1192
01:18:42,529 --> 01:18:44,588
and it wasn't real.

1193
01:18:48,501 --> 01:18:51,993
Sharks have been here
since the beginning,

1194
01:18:52,072 --> 01:18:55,064
when there was only primitive life
in the oceans

1195
01:18:55,141 --> 01:18:57,871
and the land was mostly desert.

1196
01:18:59,646 --> 01:19:02,012
They were the top predator,

1197
01:19:02,082 --> 01:19:05,381
influencing any animal to evolve
since their inception.

1198
01:19:08,588 --> 01:19:10,886
Sharks have been gods

1199
01:19:10,957 --> 01:19:13,255
for 400 million years,

1200
01:19:13,326 --> 01:19:15,021
shaping this world

1201
01:19:15,095 --> 01:19:18,724
for the entire history
of life on land.

1202
01:19:24,403 --> 01:19:26,098
Seeing them again,

1203
01:19:26,171 --> 01:19:28,901
I knew that they're almost gone.

1204
01:19:31,276 --> 01:19:32,766
The killing of sharks

1205
01:19:32,845 --> 01:19:36,804
is the biggest ecological time bomb
we're going to face pretty soon.

1206
01:19:36,882 --> 01:19:39,646
We have to understand
that sharks are the most abundant

1207
01:19:39,718 --> 01:19:42,209
top predator on this planet,
at over 100 pounds,

1208
01:19:42,287 --> 01:19:45,347
so that tells you something.
Nature created them for a reason.

1209
01:19:45,424 --> 01:19:47,619
Now human beings just...
they don't care

1210
01:19:47,693 --> 01:19:50,457
they kill 100 million, 200 million.
"So what?" You know?

1211
01:19:50,529 --> 01:19:53,589
"Sharks are a nuisance,
a dead shark is a good shark,

1212
01:19:53,665 --> 01:19:56,725
let's kill 'em all. "
But if we kill 'em all,

1213
01:19:56,802 --> 01:19:59,566
we destroy all food chains
of an entire marine ecosystem

1214
01:19:59,638 --> 01:20:02,698
and, well, the majority of our oxygen
comes from the ocean,

1215
01:20:02,775 --> 01:20:04,470
so we should be more careful.

1216
01:20:04,543 --> 01:20:07,808
- There is no species on this planet
that has ever survived

1217
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:09,939
by ignoring
the basic laws of ecology,

1218
01:20:10,015 --> 01:20:13,882
and we're now breaking those basic laws
every day in every way,

1219
01:20:13,951 --> 01:20:18,718
and that's going to mean our own demise
in a very short period of time,

1220
01:20:18,790 --> 01:20:21,782
unless we learn to live harmoniously
with the natural world.

1221
01:20:21,859 --> 01:20:25,056
- Future generations
are gonna look back on us

1222
01:20:25,129 --> 01:20:28,724
and they're gonna think of us
as barbarians,

1223
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:31,997
the same way
we think of slave traders.

1224
01:20:32,069 --> 01:20:36,130
That they're gonna look at us
as barbarians for what we're doing,

1225
01:20:36,207 --> 01:20:39,108
the fact that we're burning
all the fossil fuels,

1226
01:20:39,177 --> 01:20:42,340
in a few generations,
that we've wiped out the oceans,

1227
01:20:42,413 --> 01:20:44,404
that we've driven species
to extinction.

1228
01:20:44,482 --> 01:20:48,248
And worse - this is the worst part -
we know what we're doing.

1229
01:20:48,319 --> 01:20:50,014
The scientists know,
the environmentalists know,

1230
01:20:50,087 --> 01:20:52,385
the companies know
and the general public knows,

1231
01:20:52,456 --> 01:20:55,084
and yet we're allowing ourselves
to do it.

1232
01:20:57,562 --> 01:21:01,053
- Sharks have lived
in balance with the oceans

1233
01:21:01,131 --> 01:21:02,928
as the top predator.

1234
01:21:04,301 --> 01:21:07,862
Now we are the top predator,

1235
01:21:07,938 --> 01:21:10,771
deciding which species we'll use

1236
01:21:10,841 --> 01:21:13,207
and which we'll destroy.

1237
01:21:13,276 --> 01:21:16,643
I wonder if we've evolved enough

1238
01:21:16,713 --> 01:21:19,147
to survive as they have.

1239
01:21:22,919 --> 01:21:26,252
We depend on the oceans
for oxygen;

1240
01:21:26,323 --> 01:21:29,292
the oceans that sharks control.

1241
01:21:33,396 --> 01:21:35,261
If we lose sharks,

1242
01:21:35,332 --> 01:21:37,960
we'll disrupt the oxygen
we need to breathe.

1243
01:21:42,339 --> 01:21:45,706
We've only been here
for a few million years

1244
01:21:45,775 --> 01:21:47,867
and in the last 100 years,

1245
01:21:47,943 --> 01:21:50,571
we've greatly impacted
life in the ocean.

1246
01:21:52,748 --> 01:21:55,911
But we also have the power
to change it for the better.

1247
01:22:01,957 --> 01:22:05,256
People in Costa Rica
weren't just rallying for sharks.

1248
01:22:06,028 --> 01:22:10,397
They were rallying for life...

1249
01:22:10,466 --> 01:22:12,434
and for us.

1250
