1
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,600
- Mommy's going to
the beauty parlor, darling.

2
00:00:51,681 --> 00:00:54,321
But I'm leaving you
with your favorite friend, Roger.

3
00:00:54,401 --> 00:00:57,121
He's going to take
very, very good care of you.

4
00:00:57,161 --> 00:01:00,761
Because if he doesn't,
he's going back to the science lab.

5
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:02,801
P-P-Please, don't worry.

6
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:04,961
Whatever you say.
Yes, ma'am.

7
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:07,641
Aye, aye, sir.
Okey do key.

8
00:01:07,721 --> 00:01:10,882
Why, I'll take care of him
like he was my own brother.

9
00:01:10,961 --> 00:01:14,762
Or my own sister. Ow!
Or my brother's sister.

10
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:18,081
- Or my second cousin,
who is twice removed...
- Cookie!

11
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:21,922
Or my ninth cousin, who is nine times
removed from his place outside.

12
00:01:22,002 --> 00:01:26,082
Or like my fifteenth cousin, who is sixteen
times removed from his mother's side,

13
00:01:26,162 --> 00:01:28,002
Or like my twenty-second cousin,

14
00:01:28,082 --> 00:01:31,522
- who is thirty-seven times
removed from his father's side,
- Cookie.

15
00:01:31,603 --> 00:01:33,442
Who is 11 times removed...

16
00:01:33,523 --> 00:01:38,883
...like my seventeenth cousin,
who is 156 times removed from any side!

17
00:01:44,843 --> 00:01:48,644
Aah!

18
00:01:48,723 --> 00:01:52,643
I'll save ya, Baby!

19
00:01:52,724 --> 00:01:54,764
Cookie.

20
00:01:54,843 --> 00:01:57,284
Don't burn yourself, Baby Herman! Whoa!

21
00:01:57,364 --> 00:02:00,444
Whoa! Ah! W-Whoa!

22
00:02:02,084 --> 00:02:04,565
Whoa! Wow!

23
00:02:04,644 --> 00:02:07,204
Whoa!

24
00:02:08,564 --> 00:02:11,005
Who turned out the lights?
Boy, it's dark in here.

25
00:02:11,085 --> 00:02:13,445
Don't they pay their electricity?

26
00:02:13,484 --> 00:02:15,365
What happened? I'll find ya, Baby!
Where are you?

27
00:02:15,404 --> 00:02:18,085
- Cookie.
- Where am I?

28
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:23,165
What's that smoke?

29
00:02:29,965 --> 00:02:33,726
Whoa!

30
00:02:33,805 --> 00:02:37,765
Whoa!

31
00:02:37,806 --> 00:02:39,886
Whoa!

32
00:02:58,127 --> 00:03:01,727
Cookie.

33
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:04,488
Wah!

34
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:09,008
Cookie.

35
00:03:13,008 --> 00:03:15,808
I'm here, Bab...
Aah!

36
00:03:29,488 --> 00:03:31,369
Wah!

37
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:38,369
Cookie.

38
00:03:40,369 --> 00:03:44,489
Wah!

39
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:56,850
Cookie. Ahh.

40
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,850
Cut!

41
00:04:02,931 --> 00:04:05,170
All right, that's the shot.

42
00:04:05,251 --> 00:04:07,410
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut!

43
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:10,691
What the hell was wrong with that take?
- Nothing with you, Baby Herman.

44
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,970
You were great. You were perfect.
You were better than perfect.

45
00:04:13,011 --> 00:04:15,371
Just Roger.
He keeps blowing his lines!

46
00:04:15,451 --> 00:04:17,891
- Roger, what's this?
- A tweeting bird.

47
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:19,851
A tweeting bird?

48
00:04:19,891 --> 00:04:21,771
Roger, read the script. Look what it says.

49
00:04:21,811 --> 00:04:25,051
It says, "Rabbit gets clunked.
Rabbit sees stars".

50
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:26,971
Not birds, stars!

51
00:04:27,052 --> 00:04:29,092
- Can we lose the playback, please?

52
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:31,852
- Roger, you're killin' me. Killin' me.
- For cryin' out loud, Roger!

53
00:04:31,931 --> 00:04:34,491
How the hell many times
do we have to do this damn scene?

54
00:04:34,572 --> 00:04:36,852
Raoul, I'll be in my trailer!

55
00:04:36,932 --> 00:04:39,892
Takin' a nap! 'Scuse me, Toots.

56
00:04:39,972 --> 00:04:42,812
My stomach can't take this.
This set is a mess. Clean this set up.

57
00:04:42,892 --> 00:04:45,012
And get him outta there
or seal him up in it!

58
00:04:45,092 --> 00:04:47,093
- Lose the lights. And say lunch.
- Lunch!

59
00:04:47,172 --> 00:04:49,013
That's lunch. We're on a half.

60
00:04:49,092 --> 00:04:50,893
P-Please, Raoul, I can give you stars.

61
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:53,452
Just drop the refrigerator
on my head one more time.

62
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,492
Roger, I dropped it
on your head 23 times already.

63
00:04:55,573 --> 00:04:57,453
I can take it.
Don't worry about me.

64
00:04:57,493 --> 00:05:00,813
I'm not worried about you.
I'm worried about the refrigerator.

65
00:05:00,853 --> 00:05:03,294
I can give you stars. Look!

66
00:05:03,373 --> 00:05:07,534
Look. Look!

67
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:10,053
Please, Raoul, I can do it, I swear.

68
00:05:10,134 --> 00:05:12,014
Just give me another chance.

69
00:05:12,054 --> 00:05:14,413
Toons.

70
00:05:21,494 --> 00:05:24,574
Mr. Maroon, Mr. Valiant's here to...

71
00:05:24,654 --> 00:05:27,454
He'll be right with you.

72
00:05:36,415 --> 00:05:40,775
No, no, no! Wait until he gets to
his feet, then hit him with the boulder.

73
00:05:40,855 --> 00:05:43,575
Right, R.K.

74
00:05:43,655 --> 00:05:46,695
How much do you know about
show business, Mr. Valiant?

75
00:05:46,776 --> 00:05:50,215
Only there's no business like it,
no business I know.

76
00:05:50,296 --> 00:05:52,656
Yeah, and there's
no business more expensive.

77
00:05:52,695 --> 00:05:55,816
I'm 25 grand over budget on
the latest Baby Herman cartoon.

78
00:05:55,896 --> 00:05:58,936
You saw the rabbit blowin' his lines.
He can't keep his mind on his work.

79
00:05:59,056 --> 00:06:01,976
- You know why?
- One too many refrigerators
dropped on his head?

80
00:06:02,056 --> 00:06:05,336
Nah, he's a toon.
You can drop anything you want
on his head, he'll shake it off.

81
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:08,657
But break his heart, he goes
to pieces, just like you or me.

82
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:10,577
Read that.

83
00:06:12,576 --> 00:06:15,937
"Seen Cooing over Calamari
with Not-So-New Sugar Daddy...

84
00:06:16,057 --> 00:06:19,297
Was Jessica Rabbit, Wife of
Maroon Cartoon Star Roger".

85
00:06:19,377 --> 00:06:21,217
What's this got to do with me?

86
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,137
You're the private detective.
You figure it out.

87
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,097
Look, I don't have time for this.

88
00:06:25,178 --> 00:06:28,978
Look, Valiant, his wife's poison,
but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.

89
00:06:29,018 --> 00:06:31,138
I want you to follow her.

90
00:06:31,218 --> 00:06:34,858
Get me a couple of nice, juicy pictures
I can wise the rabbit up with.

91
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:36,938
Forget it.
I don't work Toontown.

92
00:06:37,018 --> 00:06:40,978
- What's wrong with Toontown?
Every Joe loves Toontown.
- Then get Joe to do the job.

93
00:06:41,058 --> 00:06:43,458
- 'Cause I ain't goin'.
- Whoa, fella.

94
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:45,899
You don't want to go to Toontown,
you don't have to go to Toontown.

95
00:06:45,978 --> 00:06:49,058
Nobody said you had
to go to Toontown anyway.

96
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:52,419
Have a seat, Valiant.

97
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:55,539
The rabbit's wife sings at a joint
called the Ink and Paint Club.

98
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:59,379
Toon revue.
Strictly humans only, okay?

99
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:02,620
So what do you think, Valiant?

100
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,939
Well?

101
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:13,260
The job's gonna cost ya a hundred bucks

102
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:15,860
- plus expenses.
- A hundred bucks? That's ridiculous.

103
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,340
- So's the job.
- All right, all right.

104
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,340
You got your hundred bucks.
Have a drink, Eddie.

105
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,541
Don't mind if I do.

106
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,981
- Careful, Dave! Dave, you're gonna drop it,
- I got it,

107
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,380
- I'm not gonna drop it!
- You're dropping it!

108
00:07:30,461 --> 00:07:33,301
- Watch it!
- Oh, no, the chairs are out!

109
00:07:46,181 --> 00:07:49,301
Kinda jumpy, aren't ya, Valiant?

110
00:07:49,421 --> 00:07:52,622
- It's just Dumbo.
- I know who it is.

111
00:07:52,701 --> 00:07:55,502
I got him on loan from Disney...

112
00:07:55,581 --> 00:07:59,022
him and half the cast of Fantasia,

113
00:07:59,102 --> 00:08:01,422
The best part is,

114
00:08:01,502 --> 00:08:04,662
they work for peanuts.

115
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,863
Well, I don't work for peanuts.

116
00:08:12,943 --> 00:08:14,863
Where's the other $50?

117
00:08:14,943 --> 00:08:19,183
Let's call the other $50
a carrot to finish the job.

118
00:08:19,263 --> 00:08:22,103
You been hangin' around rabbits too long.

119
00:08:27,944 --> 00:08:29,784
Hmph!

120
00:08:48,065 --> 00:08:50,545
W-Whoop! Whoop!

121
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,465
W-w-whoa!

122
00:08:54,585 --> 00:08:56,465
Oh, excuse me.

123
00:09:12,545 --> 00:09:15,226
Oh, oh, oh!

124
00:09:23,546 --> 00:09:26,546
Uh, taxi? Uh, cab?

125
00:09:26,627 --> 00:09:28,947
Hi, there.

126
00:09:35,267 --> 00:09:38,107
What do I look like, a bank?

127
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,508
Wait for me!

128
00:09:47,547 --> 00:09:50,068
- Hey, guys, wait up!
- Come on, hurry up.

129
00:09:50,147 --> 00:09:51,988
- Come on, Sid!
- Hurry up,

130
00:09:52,068 --> 00:09:54,948
- Hey, mister, ain't ya got a car?
- Who needs a car in L.A.?

131
00:09:55,068 --> 00:09:57,348
We got the best public transportation
system in the world.

132
00:10:00,188 --> 00:10:02,548
Come on, Frank,
Keep the line tight,

133
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:05,548
- It's goin'.
- All right, easy, easy.

134
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,469
- So long, sir.
- See you later.

135
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,469
- So long, mister.
- Thanks for the cigarettes.

136
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,389
- You bet.
- Any time.

137
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,470
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Eddie. How's it goin'?

138
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:39,870
- Okay. What you got for me?
- The usual bills.

139
00:10:39,911 --> 00:10:42,751
Hey, gimme back my ball.

140
00:10:55,111 --> 00:10:56,991
- Hi, Harry. You okay?
- Hi, Eddie.

141
00:11:05,471 --> 00:11:07,351
What's with Earl?

142
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,632
Laid off?

143
00:11:12,712 --> 00:11:14,552
A new outfit bought the Red Car.

144
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,472
Some big company called Cloverleaf.

145
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:18,872
No kiddin'.
They bought the Red Car?

146
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:22,712
Yeah. Put the poor guy on
two weeks' notice. Cutbacks, they said.

147
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:28,632
Oh, well, Earl.

148
00:11:28,713 --> 00:11:30,553
Here's to the pencil-pushers.

149
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:32,993
May they all get lead poisoning, eh?

150
00:11:36,393 --> 00:11:40,033
Tomorrow's Friday, Eddie.
You know what happens here on Friday?

151
00:11:40,114 --> 00:11:44,273
- Fish Special?
- My boss checks the books on Friday.

152
00:11:44,393 --> 00:11:47,153
And if I don't have that money
I gave you back in the till,

153
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,794
- I'm gonna lose my job.
- Don't bust a button, Dolores.

154
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,714
You've only got one left.

155
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:53,634
- Fifty bucks?
- Yeah.

156
00:11:53,674 --> 00:11:56,634
Where's the rest?

157
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:59,354
Well, it's only a snoop job away.

158
00:11:59,435 --> 00:12:01,314
Have you got that camera of yours?

159
00:12:01,394 --> 00:12:04,194
- Mine's in the shop.
- Wouldn't be the pawn shop
by any chance, would it?

160
00:12:04,274 --> 00:12:07,755
Aw, come on, Dolores. You need
the other $50, I need the camera.

161
00:12:11,195 --> 00:12:13,035
Any film in there?

162
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:16,876
Should be.

163
00:12:16,955 --> 00:12:19,356
I haven't had that roll developed
since our trip to Catalina.

164
00:12:19,435 --> 00:12:21,315
That sure was a long time ago.

165
00:12:21,355 --> 00:12:23,996
Yeah, that was a long time ago.

166
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:26,956
- We'll have to do that again sometime.
- Yeah, sure, Eddie.

167
00:12:32,636 --> 00:12:35,476
- Paper even good?
- Just check the scrawl.

168
00:12:35,556 --> 00:12:38,677
R.K. Maroon?
As in Maroon Cartoons?

169
00:12:38,756 --> 00:12:40,796
Maroon Cartoons?

170
00:12:40,877 --> 00:12:43,477
Hey, so who's your client,

171
00:12:43,556 --> 00:12:45,557
Mr. Detective to the Stars?

172
00:12:45,637 --> 00:12:47,997
Chilly Willy?

173
00:12:48,077 --> 00:12:50,077
Or Screwy Squirrel?

174
00:12:50,157 --> 00:12:53,117
- What do you want to drink?
- I'll take a beer, doll.

175
00:12:53,197 --> 00:12:56,477
So what happened, huh?
Somebody kidnap Dinky Doodle?

176
00:12:56,518 --> 00:12:58,397
Cut it out, Angelo.

177
00:12:58,438 --> 00:13:00,638
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, I know.

178
00:13:00,677 --> 00:13:02,558
You're workin' for Little Bo Peep.

179
00:13:02,597 --> 00:13:06,398
She's lost her sheep, and
you're gonna help her find 'em. Eh?

180
00:13:08,558 --> 00:13:11,878
- Ow!
- Get this straight, meatball.

181
00:13:11,918 --> 00:13:15,358
I... don't... work for toons.

182
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:23,799
So what's his problem?

183
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,838
- Toon killed his brother.
- What?

184
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:32,839
Dropped a piano on his head.

185
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,840
Got the password?

186
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,760
"Walt sent me".

187
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:04,561
- Nice monkey suit.
- Wiseass.

188
00:14:33,482 --> 00:14:35,682
Hey, look at that.

189
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,963
Hey, cut it out!

190
00:14:39,082 --> 00:14:41,482
Does anybody understand
what this duck is saying?

191
00:14:46,842 --> 00:14:50,083
- Hmm, Most amusing,
- A little more wine?

192
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:53,003
I've worked with a lot of wise-quackers,

193
00:14:53,043 --> 00:14:55,203
but you are despicable!

194
00:14:55,283 --> 00:14:57,243
Dog gone, stubborn little...

195
00:14:57,364 --> 00:14:59,163
That did it!

196
00:14:59,284 --> 00:15:01,243
This is the last time
I work with someone with a..

197
00:15:01,324 --> 00:15:03,684
- speech impediment!
- Oh, yeah?

198
00:15:03,723 --> 00:15:07,764
This means war.

199
00:15:17,844 --> 00:15:20,484
- What, do you think that's funny?
- Oh, it's a panic.

200
00:15:20,525 --> 00:15:23,484
You won't think it's funny
when I stick that pen up your nose.

201
00:15:23,565 --> 00:15:26,565
Now calm down, son, will ya?
Look, the stain's gone.

202
00:15:26,604 --> 00:15:28,885
It's disappearing ink.
No hard feelings, I hope.

203
00:15:29,005 --> 00:15:31,365
- Look, I'm...
- I know who you are.

204
00:15:31,485 --> 00:15:34,605
Marvin Acme, the guy
that owns Toontown. The Gag King.

205
00:15:34,645 --> 00:15:37,806
"If it's Acme, it's a gasser".
Put it there, pal.

206
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:44,045
The hand buzzer.
Still our biggest seller.

207
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,766
Scotch on the rocks.

208
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:55,247
And I mean ice!

209
00:16:00,086 --> 00:16:02,686
This is hot stuff.

210
00:16:06,687 --> 00:16:10,847
- Yeah!

211
00:16:24,048 --> 00:16:26,967
Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo!

212
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:40,089
Hey, those ducks are funny.

213
00:16:40,168 --> 00:16:43,008
They-They never get to finish the act.

214
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:45,488
- Great. Thanks.
- Rocks.

215
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:52,009
- Toons.
- Cigars? Cigarettes?

216
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:56,249
- Eddie Valiant!
- Betty?

217
00:16:56,369 --> 00:16:58,610
Long time no see.

218
00:16:58,689 --> 00:17:03,410
- What are you doing here?
- Work's been kinda slow
since cartoons went to color

219
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:07,170
But I still got it, Eddie.
Boop boop be-doop, boop!

220
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:11,210
Yeah. You still got it.

221
00:17:17,531 --> 00:17:21,931
- What's with him?
- Mr. Acme never misses
a night when Jessica performs.

222
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,890
Got a thing for rabbits, huh?

223
00:19:55,738 --> 00:19:57,698
Who is it?

224
00:19:57,818 --> 00:20:01,098
Jessica, dear, have no fear.
Your Marvin is here.

225
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:05,179
You sure murdered 'em
again tonight, baby.

226
00:20:05,259 --> 00:20:09,019
I really mean it,
My darling, you were superb.

227
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:11,739
You absolutely, truly and honestly

228
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:13,979
fashmolyed that audience.

229
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:16,379
You killed them, You slayed them,

230
00:20:16,459 --> 00:20:19,300
You belted them, You were terrific,

231
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,700
What do you think you're doing, chump?

232
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,860
Who are you callin' a chump, chimp?

233
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,820
Aah!

234
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,661
And don't let me catch your peepin' face
around here again, got it?

235
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,381
Ooga-booga!

236
00:20:59,502 --> 00:21:02,302
Come, my dear Jessica, Come over here,

237
00:21:02,382 --> 00:21:05,782
I've got everything arranged
right here on the bed.

238
00:21:05,902 --> 00:21:09,502
Oh, not tonight, Marvin,
I have a headache.

239
00:21:09,582 --> 00:21:12,462
But Jessica, you promised.

240
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:14,462
Oh, all right.

241
00:21:14,502 --> 00:21:17,382
But this time, take off that handbuzzer.

242
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:22,223
Patty-cake

243
00:21:22,302 --> 00:21:25,623
- Patty-cake, Patty-cake,
- Oh, Marvin,

244
00:21:25,663 --> 00:21:27,543
- Patty-cake,
- Marvin!

245
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:31,223
- Patty-cake, Patty-cake,
- Marvin, Oh!

246
00:21:31,263 --> 00:21:33,183
- Patty-cake! Patty-cake!
- Oh, Marvin!

247
00:21:33,224 --> 00:21:35,103
- Patty-cake, Patty-cake, Patty-cake!
- Oh, no, Marv...

248
00:21:35,144 --> 00:21:37,023
- Patty-cake! Patty-cake! Patty-cake!
- You gotta be kiddin' me.

249
00:21:37,184 --> 00:21:39,784
Patty-cake, patty-cake?

250
00:21:39,863 --> 00:21:42,743
I don't believe it!

251
00:21:44,744 --> 00:21:47,424
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!

252
00:21:47,504 --> 00:21:49,784
Is that true?

253
00:21:49,824 --> 00:21:53,624
Take comfort, son. You're not the first
man whose wife played patty-cake on him.

254
00:21:59,904 --> 00:22:02,785
I just don't believe it.

255
00:22:02,865 --> 00:22:05,624
I won't believe it.
I can't believe it.

256
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:07,545
I shan't believe it.

257
00:22:07,585 --> 00:22:10,305
Believe it, kid.
I took the pictures myself.

258
00:22:10,345 --> 00:22:12,785
- She played patty-cake.
- No!

259
00:22:12,866 --> 00:22:15,705
Not my Jessica.
Not patty-cake!

260
00:22:15,785 --> 00:22:18,145
This is impossible.
I don't believe it.

261
00:22:18,186 --> 00:22:20,185
It can't be.
It can't be!

262
00:22:20,266 --> 00:22:23,906
Jessica's my wife.
It's absolutely impossible!

263
00:22:23,946 --> 00:22:26,186
Jessica's the light of my life.

264
00:22:26,266 --> 00:22:29,146
The apple of my eye.
The cream in my coffee.

265
00:22:29,226 --> 00:22:32,306
You better start drinkin' it black,
'cause Acme's takin' the cream now.

266
00:22:32,386 --> 00:22:36,187
Hard to believe. Marvin Acme's been
my friend and neighbor for 30 years.

267
00:22:36,266 --> 00:22:38,146
Who would've thought he was a sugar daddy?

268
00:22:38,186 --> 00:22:40,746
Somebody must a made her do it.

269
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:43,747
Now drink this, son.
It'll make you feel better.

270
00:22:50,468 --> 00:22:52,827
Aah!

271
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:01,747
Aah!

272
00:23:14,148 --> 00:23:16,629
Thanks. I needed that.

273
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:23,189
Son of a bitch.

274
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,109
Look, Mr. Maroon.

275
00:23:25,189 --> 00:23:28,029
I think my work here is finished.

276
00:23:28,109 --> 00:23:31,389
How 'bout that carrot you owe me, huh?

277
00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:33,790
- A dea"s a deal.
- Great.

278
00:23:33,869 --> 00:23:36,950
Thanks. Phew.

279
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:38,870
Roger,

280
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,430
I know all this seems pretty painful now.

281
00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:43,670
But you'll find someone new.

282
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,230
- Won't he, Mr. Valiant?
- Yeah, sure.

283
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,910
A good-looking guy like that?

284
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:51,990
- The dames will be breakin' his door down.
- Dames? What dames?

285
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,071
Jessica's the only one for me.
You'll see!

286
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,991
We'll rise above this piddling peccadillo.

287
00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:00,231
We're gonna be happy again. Got that?
Happy. Capital H-A-P-P-I.

288
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,871
Well, at least he took it well.

289
00:24:18,392 --> 00:24:20,232
Oh, Jessica.

290
00:24:20,312 --> 00:24:23,912
Please tell me it's not true.

291
00:24:28,032 --> 00:24:29,872
P-P-Please.

292
00:26:44,239 --> 00:26:46,839
Oh, Lieutenant Santino.

293
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:51,279
Where'd you come from?

294
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,760
Gee whiz, Eddie. If you needed money
so bad, why didn't you come to me?

295
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,000
So I took a couple
of dirty pictures. So kill me.

296
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,080
- I already got a stiff
on my hands, thank you.
- Huh?

297
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,680
Marvin Acme.

298
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,600
- The rabbit kacked him last night.
- What?

299
00:27:17,201 --> 00:27:20,001
Now what?

300
00:27:20,081 --> 00:27:23,121
It's just I haven't been
this close to Toontown for a while.

301
00:27:23,201 --> 00:27:27,241
Yeeow!

302
00:27:27,321 --> 00:27:29,481
Oof, oof, oof! Ow!

303
00:27:29,521 --> 00:27:32,241
My biscuits are burnin'!
Fire in the hatch! Ow! Ooh!

304
00:27:32,322 --> 00:27:34,762
Eee! Great horny toads, that smarts!

305
00:27:40,362 --> 00:27:43,282
Come on, Eddie.
Let's get this over with.

306
00:27:47,242 --> 00:27:49,083
He's with me.

307
00:27:54,482 --> 00:27:57,322
- I didn't see anything, I mean,
the worst of it...
- Come on, Lieutenant,

308
00:27:57,362 --> 00:28:01,323
Just like a toon to drop a safe
on a guy's head.

309
00:28:01,363 --> 00:28:05,563
Sorry, Eddie.
You better wait here, all right?

310
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:07,803
You got a positive ID, on the victim?

311
00:28:18,043 --> 00:28:20,444
Hey, Chisold, get a load of this.

312
00:28:21,484 --> 00:28:23,484
You seen one of these?

313
00:28:26,564 --> 00:28:29,564
Hey, guys!

314
00:28:39,565 --> 00:28:43,005
Didn't you used to be Eddie Valiant?

315
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:47,125
Or did you change your name
to Jack Daniels?

316
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:56,526
- What's that?
- Paint from the rabbit's glove.

317
00:28:56,605 --> 00:28:58,486
Mr. Valiant?

318
00:29:01,926 --> 00:29:06,486
I hope you're proud of yourself
and those pictures you took!

319
00:29:13,287 --> 00:29:15,087
- Oh, for cryin' out loud, Mike,

320
00:29:15,126 --> 00:29:18,447
Hey, we need some help over here!
Hey, somebody grab those loafers!

321
00:29:21,007 --> 00:29:23,687
Oh, oh! Oh,

322
00:29:36,968 --> 00:29:38,808
Ow.

323
00:29:46,688 --> 00:29:49,808
Is this man removing evidence
from the scene of a crime?

324
00:29:49,848 --> 00:29:53,209
Uh, no, Judge Doom. Uh, Valiant here
was just pickin' it up for ya.

325
00:29:53,329 --> 00:29:55,168
Weren't ya, Eddie?

326
00:29:55,249 --> 00:29:57,929
- Hand it over.
- Sure.

327
00:30:01,089 --> 00:30:03,249
His number-one seller.

328
00:30:04,449 --> 00:30:07,330
I see working for a toon
has rubbed off on you.

329
00:30:07,409 --> 00:30:13,050
- I wasn't workin' for a toon.
I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
- Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.

330
00:30:13,129 --> 00:30:17,290
He told us the rabbit became quite agitated
when you showed him the pictures.

331
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:21,330
The rabbit said, one way or another,
he and his wife are going to be happy.

332
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:23,250
Is that true?

333
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,490
Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?

334
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:27,410
Shut your yap, Eddie.
The man's a judge.

335
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,330
That's all right, Lieutenant.

336
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:32,571
From the smell of him,
I'd say it was the booze talking.

337
00:30:32,691 --> 00:30:35,171
No matter.
The rabbit won't get far.

338
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:37,211
My men will find him.

339
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:47,451
- Weasels?
- Yes. I find they have
a special gift for the work.

340
00:30:47,491 --> 00:30:50,412
All right, ya mugs.
Fall out.

341
00:30:50,491 --> 00:30:52,332
Did you find the rabbit?

342
00:30:52,411 --> 00:30:56,252
Don't worry, Judge.
We got "deformants" all over the city.

343
00:30:56,331 --> 00:30:58,492
We'll find 'im.

344
00:30:58,612 --> 00:31:02,372
You wouldn't have any idea where
the rabbit might be, Mr. Valiant?

345
00:31:03,453 --> 00:31:06,292
Have you tried Walla Walla?
Cucamonga?

346
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:09,292
I hear Kokomo's very nice
this time of the year.

347
00:31:09,372 --> 00:31:12,012
I'm surprised you're not
more cooperative, Mr. Valiant.

348
00:31:12,093 --> 00:31:15,893
A human has been murdered by a toon.
Don't you appreciate the magnitude of that?

349
00:31:20,573 --> 00:31:24,294
Since I've had Toontown
under my jurisdiction,

350
00:31:24,373 --> 00:31:27,693
my goal has been to reign in the insanity.

351
00:31:27,773 --> 00:31:31,333
And the only way to do that
is to make toons respect...

352
00:31:31,414 --> 00:31:33,253
- the law.

353
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:47,574
How did that gargoyle get to be a judge?

354
00:31:47,654 --> 00:31:50,934
Spread a bunch of simoleons
around Toontown a couple of years back.

355
00:31:50,974 --> 00:31:53,974
- Bought the election.
- Yeah? What's that?

356
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:59,294
Remember how they always thought
there wasn't a way to kill a toon?

357
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,215
- Yeah,
- Well, Doom found a way,

358
00:32:01,295 --> 00:32:04,735
Turpentine, acetone, benzene,
He calls it "The Dip".

359
00:32:04,855 --> 00:32:06,936
I'll catch the rabbit, Mr, Valiant,

360
00:32:06,975 --> 00:32:09,816
And I'll try him, convict him...

361
00:32:09,855 --> 00:32:12,375
and execute him.

362
00:32:20,496 --> 00:32:22,976
Geez!

363
00:32:27,856 --> 00:32:32,057
That's one dead shoe, eh, Boss?

364
00:32:32,096 --> 00:32:34,816
They're not kid gloves, Mr. Valiant.

365
00:32:34,897 --> 00:32:38,977
This is how we handle things
down in Toontown.

366
00:32:39,017 --> 00:32:41,857
I'd think you, of all people,
would appreciate that.

367
00:32:58,498 --> 00:33:01,578
Uh... Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, wait a minute! Hey, hey!

368
00:33:04,058 --> 00:33:08,099
I've been tryin' to make him quit,
but he just won't listen to me.

369
00:33:08,178 --> 00:33:10,258
What do you know, ya dumb broad?
You got the I.Q. Of a rattle.

370
00:33:10,339 --> 00:33:12,339
- You Valiant?
- Yeah.

371
00:33:12,418 --> 00:33:15,179
I want to talk to you
about the Acme murder. Hey, psst.

372
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:18,259
Doll, why don't you run downstairs
and get me a racin' form?

373
00:33:18,339 --> 00:33:21,499
Ooh! Okay, okay. I'm goin'.

374
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,419
A ladies' man, huh?

375
00:33:24,499 --> 00:33:27,180
My problem is I got a 50-year-old lust
and a three-year-old dinky.

376
00:33:27,259 --> 00:33:31,140
- Yeah. Must be tough.
- Look, Valiant, the rabbit didn't kill Acme.

377
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,499
He's not a murderer, I should know.
He's a dear friend of mine,

378
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:37,980
I tell you, Valiant, the whole thing
stinks like yesterday's diapers.

379
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:41,380
Look at this.
The paper said Acme left no will.

380
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:44,741
That's a load of succotash.
Every toon knows Acme had a will.

381
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,061
He promised to leave Toontown to us toons.

382
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,021
That will is the reason he got bumped off.

383
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,941
Has anybody ever seen this will?

384
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,501
Uh, no. But he gave us his solemn oath.

385
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:58,701
If you believe that that joker could do
anything solid, the gag's on you, pal.

386
00:33:58,781 --> 00:34:01,782
I just figured, since you were
the one who got my pal in trouble,

387
00:34:01,861 --> 00:34:03,781
you might want to help get him out.

388
00:34:03,861 --> 00:34:06,261
I can pay ya.

389
00:34:06,341 --> 00:34:09,341
Save your money for
a pair of elevator shoes.

390
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:12,702
- Wait! No, Valiant, no! Ow, my stogie!
- Oh!

391
00:34:14,182 --> 00:34:16,702
Wah!

392
00:34:16,782 --> 00:34:20,102
Wah!

393
00:34:20,222 --> 00:34:22,062
Wah!

394
00:34:27,022 --> 00:34:29,863
It ain't my fault the rabbit
got himself in trouble.

395
00:34:33,742 --> 00:34:36,503
All I did was take
a couple of lousy pictures.

396
00:34:56,784 --> 00:34:58,664
Baby was right.

397
00:35:08,464 --> 00:35:10,264
The hell with it.

398
00:35:37,266 --> 00:35:39,266
- Aah!
- Aah!

399
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:42,587
- How the hell did you get in here?
- Through the mail slot.

400
00:35:42,666 --> 00:35:46,427
I thought it would be best if I waited
inside, seeing's how I'm wanted for murder.

401
00:35:46,506 --> 00:35:49,707
No kidding. Just talking to you could
get me a rap for Aiding and Abetting.

402
00:35:49,786 --> 00:35:52,587
Wait a minute.
Anybody know you're here?

403
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:55,147
- Nobody. Not a soul, except, uh...
- Who?

404
00:35:55,267 --> 00:35:57,107
Well, you see,

405
00:35:57,187 --> 00:35:59,987
I didn't know where your office was.

406
00:36:00,067 --> 00:36:01,907
So I asked a newsboy.
He didn't know.

407
00:36:01,987 --> 00:36:04,627
So I asked the fireman, the greengrocer,
the butcher, the baker.

408
00:36:04,707 --> 00:36:07,627
They didn't know.
But the liquor store guy, he knew.

409
00:36:07,747 --> 00:36:09,828
- In other words, the whole
damn town knows you're here!
- Hey! Hey!

410
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:11,908
- Come on! Come on!
- All right.
Eddie, take it easy, will ya?

411
00:36:11,987 --> 00:36:14,748
Please, Eddie, don't throw me out.
You're making a big mistake.

412
00:36:14,828 --> 00:36:16,908
I didn't kill anybody.
I swear!

413
00:36:16,988 --> 00:36:20,869
This whole thing's a setup,
a scam, a frame job. Ow!

414
00:36:20,988 --> 00:36:23,028
Eddie, I could never hurt anybody. Ow!

415
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:26,268
My whole purpose...
in... life... is... to...

416
00:36:26,349 --> 00:36:29,668
make... people...

417
00:36:29,749 --> 00:36:32,709
laugh.

418
00:36:32,749 --> 00:36:34,789
Okay, okay, sure.
I admit it.

419
00:36:34,829 --> 00:36:38,469
I got a little steamed when
you showed me those pictures of Jessica,

420
00:36:38,509 --> 00:36:41,509
So I rushed over to the Ink and Paint Club.

421
00:36:41,549 --> 00:36:45,349
But she wasn't in her dressing room,
So I wrote her a love letter.

422
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:47,909
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

423
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:51,909
You're telling me, in a fit of jealousy,
you wrote your wife a love letter?

424
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:56,430
That's right. I know that she was just
an innocent victim of circumstance.

425
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:59,271
I suppose you used the old
lipstick-on-the-mirror routine, huh?

426
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,191
Lipstick, yes.
Mirror, no.

427
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:05,190
I found a nice, clean piece of paper.
"Dear Jessica,

428
00:37:05,271 --> 00:37:09,231
"How do I love thee?
Let me count the ways.

429
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,590
"One, one thousand. Two, one thousand.
Three, one thousand.

430
00:37:12,631 --> 00:37:15,631
- Four, one thousand. Five..."
- Why didn't you just leave
the letter there?

431
00:37:15,751 --> 00:37:19,791
Obviously, a poem of this power
and sensitivity must... Aah...

432
00:37:19,831 --> 00:37:21,711
be read in person.

433
00:37:21,752 --> 00:37:23,631
So I went home to wait for her.

434
00:37:23,672 --> 00:37:27,311
But the weasels were
there waitin' for me. So... So I ran.

435
00:37:27,392 --> 00:37:31,752
So why come to me? I'm the guy
that took the pictures of your wife.

436
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:34,472
Yeah. And you're also the guy
that helped all these toons.

437
00:37:34,512 --> 00:37:39,152
Everybody knows when a toon's in trouble,
there's only one place to go:

438
00:37:39,232 --> 00:37:42,473
- Valiant and Valiant.
- Not anymore.

439
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:45,032
Get outta that chair!

440
00:37:47,352 --> 00:37:51,113
- That's my brother's chair.
- Yeah, where is your brother, anyway?

441
00:37:51,193 --> 00:37:53,993
He looks like a sensitive...
and sober... fellow.

442
00:37:54,073 --> 00:37:56,433
That's it.
I'm callin' the cops.

443
00:37:56,473 --> 00:37:58,353
Go ahead,
Call the cops,

444
00:37:58,394 --> 00:38:00,953
I come here for help, and what do you do?

445
00:38:01,073 --> 00:38:04,274
You turn me in. No, no.
Don't feel guilty about me.

446
00:38:04,353 --> 00:38:07,554
So long, and thanks for nothin'.

447
00:38:08,914 --> 00:38:12,034
That's the closet!
Stupe.

448
00:38:24,595 --> 00:38:28,515
Eddie Valiant, you're under arrest.

449
00:38:28,594 --> 00:38:30,555
Get outta there!

450
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:34,435
- Idiot. I got no keys for these cuffs.
- Huh?

451
00:38:36,435 --> 00:38:38,835
Yah!

452
00:38:41,955 --> 00:38:44,395
Come on.
Get the lead out.

453
00:38:44,436 --> 00:38:46,956
Move it, would ya? Move it!

454
00:38:47,076 --> 00:38:50,675
Yah! It's the Toon Patrol!

455
00:38:54,516 --> 00:38:56,956
Hide me, Eddie!
P-P-Please!

456
00:38:58,676 --> 00:39:02,157
- Remember, you never saw me.
- Get outta there!

457
00:39:02,276 --> 00:39:04,917
Don't let 'em find me.

458
00:39:04,996 --> 00:39:07,836
Come on, Eddie.
You're my only hope.

459
00:39:07,917 --> 00:39:11,637
Open up in the name of the law.

460
00:39:11,677 --> 00:39:14,877
P-P-Please, Eddie, You know
there's no justice for toons anymore,

461
00:39:14,957 --> 00:39:17,678
If the weasels get their hands on me,

462
00:39:17,717 --> 00:39:20,117
I'm as good as Dipped.

463
00:39:20,197 --> 00:39:22,117
Don't make us play rough, Valiant,

464
00:39:22,198 --> 00:39:24,557
We just want the rabbit.

465
00:39:24,597 --> 00:39:26,958
What're we gonna do, Eddie?
What're we gonna do?

466
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:29,558
What are we gonna do?

467
00:39:29,637 --> 00:39:32,078
What's all this "we" stuff?
They just want the rabbit.

468
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:45,359
Looks like they gave us the slip, huh, Boss?

469
00:39:45,438 --> 00:39:48,519
Nah. Valiant's got him stashed somewhere.

470
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:52,398
Hold it right there.

471
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:57,359
Hello, boys.
I didn't hear you come in.

472
00:39:58,359 --> 00:40:00,239
Okay, wise guy.

473
00:40:00,279 --> 00:40:03,159
- Where's the rabbit?
- Haven't seen him.

474
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:07,759
- What's in there?
- My lingerie.

475
00:40:07,799 --> 00:40:09,679
Geez, Valiant.

476
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,640
Search the place, boys.

477
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,361
And leave no stone "interned".

478
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:24,561
Look, Valiant, we got a reliable
tip-off the rabbit was here.

479
00:40:24,601 --> 00:40:27,081
And it was "corrugated" by several others.

480
00:40:27,161 --> 00:40:30,721
So cut the bull schtick.

481
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,961
You keep talkin' like that, and
I'm gonna have to wash your mouth out.

482
00:40:45,602 --> 00:40:48,162
Stop that laughing!

483
00:40:52,002 --> 00:40:54,002
Stop that laughin'!

484
00:40:54,082 --> 00:40:57,682
You know what happens
when you can't stop laughin'.

485
00:41:01,363 --> 00:41:04,162
One of these days,
you're gonna die laughin'.

486
00:41:06,762 --> 00:41:09,403
As for you, Valiant, step outta line...

487
00:41:09,443 --> 00:41:14,043
and we'll hang you
and your laundry out to dry.

488
00:41:17,243 --> 00:41:20,523
Come on, boys.
Let's am-scray.

489
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:23,964
- They're gone.

490
00:41:24,043 --> 00:41:27,323
Jeepers, Eddie, that was swell.
You saved my life.

491
00:41:27,364 --> 00:41:29,724
How can I ever repay ya?

492
00:41:31,684 --> 00:41:35,604
Blecch! For starters,
don't ever kiss me again.

493
00:41:37,725 --> 00:41:40,124
Will you stop kickin' me?

494
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:42,044
Stop kickin' me.

495
00:41:43,564 --> 00:41:45,405
Dolores.

496
00:41:45,485 --> 00:41:48,125
Dolores. Dolores!

497
00:41:53,005 --> 00:41:55,285
Hey, Eddie, you made the front page today.

498
00:41:55,325 --> 00:41:57,805
- Yeah, I guess I made some ink.
- And what ink.

499
00:41:57,886 --> 00:42:00,685
Come on, Eddie.

500
00:42:04,805 --> 00:42:06,685
So tell me, Eddie,

501
00:42:06,725 --> 00:42:10,686
is that a rabbit in your pocket,
or are you just happy to see me?

502
00:42:10,766 --> 00:42:13,326
Cut the comedy, Dolores.
I've had a very hard day.

503
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:16,806
- I gotta get outta these cuffs.
- Oh, swell.

504
00:42:16,886 --> 00:42:18,727
Whew!

505
00:42:18,806 --> 00:42:21,166
Jeepers, Eddie, That almost killed me,

506
00:42:21,246 --> 00:42:25,486
- Ow.
- Boy, what is this?
Some kind of a secret room?

507
00:42:25,567 --> 00:42:27,887
It's a rotgut room,
hold over from Prohibition.

508
00:42:27,966 --> 00:42:31,247
Oh, I get it, a speak easy.
A gin mill. A hooch parlor.

509
00:42:31,327 --> 00:42:33,167
- Tools are up here, Eddie.
- Look at this!

510
00:42:33,247 --> 00:42:35,367
- Aah!
- It's a spy hole.

511
00:42:35,447 --> 00:42:38,127
Jeepers, Eddie,
this'd be a great place to hide.

512
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:42,328
- Crazy toons. Oof!
- Watch your head.

513
00:42:44,447 --> 00:42:46,808
I thought you said
you'd never take another toon case.

514
00:42:46,887 --> 00:42:49,328
- What'd you have, a change of heart?
- Nothin's changed.

515
00:42:49,408 --> 00:42:52,528
Somebody's made a patsy outta me,
and I'm gonna find out why.

516
00:42:59,808 --> 00:43:02,168
Hold still, will ya?

517
00:43:03,809 --> 00:43:06,129
- Does this help?
- Yeah, thanks.

518
00:43:10,369 --> 00:43:13,729
Do you mean to tell me that you could have
taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?

519
00:43:13,849 --> 00:43:17,769
- No, not at any time. Only when it was funny.
- Get outta here!

520
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:20,929
Come on, Eddie.
Where's your sense of humor?

521
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:23,649
He always this funny, or only
on days when he's wanted for murder?

522
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:25,569
Listen.
My "silosophy" is this.

523
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:28,330
If you don't have a good sense
of humor, you're better off dead.

524
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:31,610
You just may get your wish unless
I can figure out what happened to this.

525
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,530
What is it, Eddie?

526
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:35,890
Just look at it.

527
00:43:35,971 --> 00:43:37,770
- Mr. Acme's will.
- Yeah,

528
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:41,890
And I think Maroon played the part of sound
mind, and your wife, the sound body.

529
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:44,530
- Why, I resent that innuendo.
- What's the scheme, Eddie?

530
00:43:44,611 --> 00:43:47,770
- I don't think they got to the will.
- But how do you know?

531
00:43:47,811 --> 00:43:50,571
Because they were still lookin'
for it after they killed him.

532
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:52,811
Anything I can do?

533
00:43:52,891 --> 00:43:55,291
Maybe you could go downtown
and check the probate.

534
00:43:55,331 --> 00:43:57,212
Yeah, check the probate.

535
00:43:57,251 --> 00:43:59,611
Why, my Uncle Thumper had
a problem with his probate.

536
00:43:59,651 --> 00:44:03,612
And he had to take these
big pills and drink lots of water.

537
00:44:03,691 --> 00:44:06,532
Not prostate, you idiot.
Probate.

538
00:44:06,612 --> 00:44:08,452
Let me get this straight.

539
00:44:08,532 --> 00:44:10,572
You think that my boss, R.K. Maroon,

540
00:44:10,652 --> 00:44:13,212
dropped a safe on Marvin Acme's head...

541
00:44:13,292 --> 00:44:15,532
so that he could get his hands on Toontown?

542
00:44:15,613 --> 00:44:17,533
Yep.

543
00:44:17,612 --> 00:44:19,973
That's my hunch.

544
00:44:20,052 --> 00:44:23,852
Uh, can he stay here for a couple of days?

545
00:44:23,933 --> 00:44:26,732
Not gonna do anything crazy, is he?

546
00:44:32,293 --> 00:44:35,093
- Where are you goin'?
- Back to the office.

547
00:44:37,134 --> 00:44:40,694
Mr. Valiant? Mr. Valiant?

548
00:44:46,614 --> 00:44:49,414
You've got the wrong idea
about me, Mr. Valiant.

549
00:44:49,454 --> 00:44:52,054
I'm a pawn in this, just like Roger.

550
00:44:52,134 --> 00:44:55,214
Can you help me find him?
Just name your price.

551
00:44:55,294 --> 00:44:57,134
And I'll pay it.

552
00:44:57,214 --> 00:44:59,055
Yeah. I'll bet you would.

553
00:44:59,134 --> 00:45:02,454
You gotta have the rabbit
to make the scam work.

554
00:45:02,534 --> 00:45:06,135
No, no, no. I love my husband.
You've got me all wrong.

555
00:45:06,215 --> 00:45:09,655
You don't know how hard
it is being a woman...

556
00:45:09,735 --> 00:45:11,575
Iooking the way I do.

557
00:45:11,655 --> 00:45:13,496
Yeah, well,

558
00:45:13,575 --> 00:45:17,015
you don't know how hard it is being a man...

559
00:45:17,095 --> 00:45:19,855
Iooking at a woman looking the way you do.

560
00:45:19,936 --> 00:45:23,736
I'm not bad.
I'm just drawn that way.

561
00:45:27,976 --> 00:45:31,416
Weren't you the one I caught playin'
patty-cake with Old Man Acme?

562
00:45:31,496 --> 00:45:34,856
You didn't catch me, Mr. Valiant.
You were set up to take those pictures.

563
00:45:34,936 --> 00:45:38,297
- What are you talkin' about?
- Maroon wanted to blackmail Acme.

564
00:45:38,376 --> 00:45:40,416
I didn't want to have
anything to do with it.

565
00:45:40,497 --> 00:45:43,576
But he said, if I didn't pose
for those patty-cake pictures,

566
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:47,857
Roger would never work in this town
again. I couldn't let that happen.

567
00:45:47,936 --> 00:45:51,457
I'd do anything for my husband, Mr. Valiant.

568
00:45:51,497 --> 00:45:54,498
- Anything.
- What a wife.

569
00:45:54,537 --> 00:45:58,297
I'm desperate, Mr. Valiant.
Can't you see how much I need you?

570
00:45:58,377 --> 00:46:01,178
Dabblin' in water colors, Eddie?

571
00:46:02,418 --> 00:46:04,858
Well.

572
00:46:06,057 --> 00:46:08,138
Sorry.

573
00:46:08,218 --> 00:46:11,978
Good-bye, Eddie.
My offer stands firm.

574
00:46:12,058 --> 00:46:14,618
Think about it.

575
00:46:22,339 --> 00:46:24,858
Well!

576
00:46:24,939 --> 00:46:27,979
Do you want to tell me what she was
doing with her arms around you?

577
00:46:28,059 --> 00:46:30,379
Probably lookin' for a good place
to stick a knife.

578
00:46:30,459 --> 00:46:34,019
- Oh, come on, Eddie.
I caught you with your pants down!
- Yeah, but...

579
00:46:34,099 --> 00:46:35,739
Dolores, come...

580
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:40,619
Come on, Dolores.

581
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:43,140
You don't believe a painted hussy
like that could turn my head.

582
00:46:43,219 --> 00:46:45,100
She's just tryin' to get
her hands on the rabbit.

583
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,300
That's not all she's trying
to get her hands on.

584
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:50,180
Now look, Dolores, listen.
Listen to me.

585
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:53,540
Look, I want you to go out. I want you
to buy yourself a new swimsuit.

586
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:55,460
'Cause you and me are goin' to Catalina.

587
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,981
- I'm on the verge of wrappin' up this case.
- No, you're not, Eddie.

588
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:02,341
That's what I came to tell you.
I stopped by Probate.

589
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:05,980
Maroon's not after Toontown,
like you thought.

590
00:47:06,061 --> 00:47:08,781
It's Cloverleaf that wants
to get their hands on Toontown.

591
00:47:08,821 --> 00:47:10,701
They put in the highest bid.

592
00:47:10,741 --> 00:47:13,501
And unless Mr. Acme's will shows up
by midnight tonight,

593
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:15,941
Cloverleaf is gonna own Toontown.

594
00:47:16,021 --> 00:47:18,381
What? At midnight tonight?

595
00:47:18,501 --> 00:47:20,342
That's right.

596
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:25,142
First they buy the Red Car. Then they
want to get their hands on Toontown.

597
00:47:25,222 --> 00:47:27,502
- I don't get it.
- Shh!

598
00:47:27,582 --> 00:47:29,902
Roger.

599
00:47:32,982 --> 00:47:35,183
The rabbit. Get the Judge.

600
00:47:38,102 --> 00:47:42,222
Nice shirt.
Who's your tailor, Quasimodo?

601
00:48:06,623 --> 00:48:09,984
Oh!

602
00:48:10,064 --> 00:48:13,984
Eddie, what are ya... Yah!

603
00:48:14,064 --> 00:48:17,104
Hey, who turned out the lights?

604
00:48:17,184 --> 00:48:19,784
I can't see a thing.
What's goin' on?

605
00:48:19,865 --> 00:48:22,065
You crazy rabbit,

606
00:48:22,144 --> 00:48:24,464
I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.

607
00:48:24,545 --> 00:48:27,385
And what are you doin'?
Singin' and dancin'!

608
00:48:29,425 --> 00:48:32,105
But I'm a toon. Toons are
supposed to make people laugh.

609
00:48:32,145 --> 00:48:36,425
- Sit down!
- You don't understand.
Those people needed to laugh.

610
00:48:36,506 --> 00:48:38,865
Yeah, and when they're done laughing,
they'll call the cops.

611
00:48:38,905 --> 00:48:41,106
That guy, Angelo,
would rat on you for a nickel.

612
00:48:41,146 --> 00:48:43,626
Not Angelo.
He'd never turn me in.

613
00:48:43,706 --> 00:48:46,466
- Why? Because you made him laugh?
- That's right.

614
00:48:46,546 --> 00:48:49,466
A laugh can be a very powerful thing.

615
00:48:49,546 --> 00:48:53,107
Why, sometimes in life,
it's the only weapon we have.

616
00:48:53,186 --> 00:48:55,066
- Laughter is the most im...
- Shh.

617
00:48:55,147 --> 00:48:58,906
Ix-nay. Ix-nay.

618
00:49:04,786 --> 00:49:07,106
I'm looking for a murderer.

619
00:49:18,868 --> 00:49:20,707
A rabbit.

620
00:49:23,187 --> 00:49:25,668
A toon rabbit...

621
00:49:25,748 --> 00:49:29,988
about yea... big.

622
00:49:30,068 --> 00:49:33,508
Look, there's no rabbit here.

623
00:49:33,588 --> 00:49:35,428
So don't harass my customers.

624
00:49:35,508 --> 00:49:39,788
I didn't come here to harass.
I came here to reward.

625
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:16,670
Hey. I seen a rabbit.

626
00:50:16,751 --> 00:50:19,351
Where?

627
00:50:19,511 --> 00:50:21,271
Ya see?

628
00:50:27,271 --> 00:50:30,391
- Where?
- He's right here in the bar.

629
00:50:36,711 --> 00:50:39,392
Well, say hello, Harvey.

630
00:50:44,911 --> 00:50:47,432
I told ya so.

631
00:51:08,793 --> 00:51:11,634
"Merry-Go-Round Broke Down"

632
00:51:13,274 --> 00:51:17,394
Quite a loony selection for
a group of drunken reprobates.

633
00:51:23,674 --> 00:51:25,513
He's here!

634
00:51:29,114 --> 00:51:32,954
Stop that laughing!

635
00:51:35,554 --> 00:51:39,075
Have you forgotten what happened last time?

636
00:51:39,195 --> 00:51:42,155
If you don't stop this laughing,
you're gonna end up dead,

637
00:51:42,235 --> 00:51:44,714
just like your idiot hyena cousins!

638
00:51:44,795 --> 00:51:48,595
Say, Boss, you want we should
"disresemble" the place?

639
00:51:48,715 --> 00:51:50,555
No, Sergeant.

640
00:51:50,635 --> 00:51:53,915
Disassembling the place won't be necessary.

641
00:51:53,955 --> 00:51:58,315
The rabbit is going to come right to me.

642
00:52:00,316 --> 00:52:03,115
- Gee.
- No toon...

643
00:52:03,196 --> 00:52:07,396
can resist the old
shave-and-a-haircut trick.

644
00:52:14,037 --> 00:52:17,236
- I don't know who's toonier, you or Doom.

645
00:52:17,276 --> 00:52:19,556
Roger.

646
00:52:22,316 --> 00:52:24,477
Ro... Roger!

647
00:52:25,917 --> 00:52:29,077
Roger, no.

648
00:52:31,237 --> 00:52:34,117
Roger, don't, Roger.

649
00:52:45,998 --> 00:52:50,798
Hey, Judge, what should we do
with the wallflower?

650
00:52:50,878 --> 00:52:52,958
We'll see to him later.

651
00:52:53,078 --> 00:52:56,998
Right now, I feel like
dispnsing some justice.

652
00:52:57,079 --> 00:52:59,319
Bring me some Dip.

653
00:52:59,559 --> 00:53:01,479
Aah!

654
00:53:05,439 --> 00:53:09,279
Does the Condemned have anything to say
before his sentence is carried out?

655
00:53:09,399 --> 00:53:11,279
Why, yeah...

656
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:14,999
Wah!

657
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:18,279
Dolores, bourbon.
And make it a double.

658
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,759
Fine time for a drink, Eddie.

659
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:24,280
- Maybe you'd like a bowl
of pretzels to go with it!
- Just pour the drink, Dolores.

660
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,200
Hey, Judge?

661
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,600
Don't a dyin' rabbit deserve a last request?

662
00:53:34,681 --> 00:53:37,321
Yeah, Noseplugs would be nice!

663
00:53:37,401 --> 00:53:39,921
I think you want a drink.

664
00:53:41,121 --> 00:53:43,601
How 'bout it, Judge?

665
00:53:43,681 --> 00:53:45,521
Well, why not?

666
00:53:45,601 --> 00:53:48,441
I don't mind prolonging the execution.

667
00:53:48,562 --> 00:53:51,521
- Happy trails.
- No thanks, Eddie. I'm tryin' to cut down.

668
00:53:51,641 --> 00:53:53,961
- Drink the drink.
- But I don't want the drink.

669
00:53:54,042 --> 00:53:56,281
- He doesn't want the drink.
- He does!
- I don't.

670
00:53:56,322 --> 00:53:57,641
- You do. You do.
- I don't. I don't.

671
00:53:57,722 --> 00:54:00,482
- You do. You don't.
- I don't. I do,

672
00:54:00,521 --> 00:54:02,962
- You don't. You don't.
- I do.

673
00:54:03,042 --> 00:54:07,002
Listen, when I say, "I do",
that means I do!

674
00:54:19,363 --> 00:54:22,563
Aah!

675
00:54:43,324 --> 00:54:45,244
Gotcha, kid.

676
00:54:49,764 --> 00:54:52,284
Come on, Eddie, let's get outta here!

677
00:54:52,325 --> 00:54:54,564
Move it, pops.
Yikes!

678
00:54:55,605 --> 00:54:57,444
That was quick thinkin', Eddie.

679
00:54:57,525 --> 00:55:00,204
Nothin' like usin' the o" spine flower,
the wise noodle, the...

680
00:55:00,285 --> 00:55:03,765
- Roger! Let's use this.
- Yah!

681
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:07,285
- Let's get outta here.
What're you waitin' for?
- There's no damn key.

682
00:55:07,365 --> 00:55:09,725
Hey, you weasels,
lemme outta here, will ya?

683
00:55:09,766 --> 00:55:13,645
- Come on, I gotta make a livin'.
- Benny, is that you?

684
00:55:13,726 --> 00:55:15,766
No, it's Eleanor Roosevelt.

685
00:55:15,845 --> 00:55:18,206
Come on, Roger, get me outta here.

686
00:55:18,285 --> 00:55:22,086
Eddie, we got ourselves a ride.
Open the doors!

687
00:55:27,006 --> 00:55:29,686
- Whoo!
- Ahh, that's better.

688
00:55:29,766 --> 00:55:32,446
I can't believe they locked me up
for drivin' on the sidewalk.

689
00:55:32,527 --> 00:55:34,967
Come on, Eddie.
Get in.

690
00:55:35,046 --> 00:55:36,887
It was just a couple of miles.

691
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:38,886
- I'll drive.
- But I wanna drive.

692
00:55:39,006 --> 00:55:41,287
No, I'll drive.
I'm the cab.

693
00:55:41,326 --> 00:55:43,967
Outta my way, pencil-neck!

694
00:55:44,047 --> 00:55:45,927
How about this weather, huh?

695
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:49,128
It never rains.

696
00:55:49,167 --> 00:55:51,247
They sprung the cab.
Let's go.

697
00:55:51,328 --> 00:55:54,848
And how about those Brooklyn Dodgers?
Are they bums, or what?

698
00:55:54,927 --> 00:55:57,127
Move over, I'm drivin'.

699
00:55:59,167 --> 00:56:01,087
Benny, Eddie, we got company!

700
00:56:01,208 --> 00:56:05,088
- Would you look at these two...
Excuse me, ladies.

701
00:56:05,168 --> 00:56:08,329
- Now that's what I call
a couple of road hogs.

702
00:56:08,408 --> 00:56:09,928
- I'm gonna blow his head off.

703
00:56:10,048 --> 00:56:14,769
Benny, look out for the Red Car!

704
00:56:17,049 --> 00:56:21,449
Whoa!

705
00:56:21,569 --> 00:56:24,409
Benny, there's cops right behind us!

706
00:56:24,489 --> 00:56:27,009
Not for long, Roger.

707
00:56:27,089 --> 00:56:29,850
Now they're right in front of us.

708
00:56:31,449 --> 00:56:33,769
Eddie, we're goin' backwards.
Turn us around!

709
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:37,130
Gimme the wheel.
Gimme the wheel!

710
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:41,730
The cops are still on our tail.

711
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:43,890
I know the cops are on our tail.
What do you think I am, bli... Benny!

712
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:48,490
Pull the lever!

713
00:56:48,531 --> 00:56:50,210
- Which one?
- Which one?

714
00:56:50,291 --> 00:56:52,771
"Which one"?

715
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:55,331
I'm gonna ram 'em.

716
00:56:56,370 --> 00:57:00,171
Whoa!

717
00:57:00,251 --> 00:57:02,491
I'm gettin' too old for this.

718
00:57:04,851 --> 00:57:06,451
Aah!

719
00:57:06,451 --> 00:57:07,891
Aah!

720
00:57:09,611 --> 00:57:13,452
- Jumpin' jeepers.
- Hey, Roger, what do you call
the middle of a song?

721
00:57:13,531 --> 00:57:17,332
Gee, I don't know...
A bridge! Aah!

722
00:57:17,412 --> 00:57:20,332
Well, fellas, where can I drop ya?

723
00:57:20,452 --> 00:57:23,252
- Somewhere we can hide.
- I got just the place.

724
00:57:23,332 --> 00:57:28,052
And incidentally, if you should ever
need a ride, just stick out your thumb.

725
00:57:28,132 --> 00:57:30,812
Hey, share the road, will ya, lady?

726
00:57:30,893 --> 00:57:35,293
Ah, now that wasn't so bad, was it?

727
00:57:49,053 --> 00:57:50,893
Boy, did you see that?

728
00:57:50,973 --> 00:57:52,933
Nobody takes a wallop like Goofy.

729
00:57:53,053 --> 00:57:56,333
What timing. What finesse.
What a genius.

730
00:57:56,414 --> 00:58:00,174
Ouch!

731
00:58:00,254 --> 00:58:03,254
We're supposed to be hiding.
What's wrong with you?

732
00:58:03,334 --> 00:58:05,174
Ow. What's wrong with you?

733
00:58:05,254 --> 00:58:07,894
You're the only person
in this theater that isn't laughing.

734
00:58:07,974 --> 00:58:11,254
Is there nothing that can
permeate your impervious puss?

735
00:58:11,334 --> 00:58:13,415
Hey, Eddie.

736
00:58:13,494 --> 00:58:15,374
Boy, nothin'.

737
00:58:15,414 --> 00:58:20,015
What could have possibly happened to
you to turn you into such a sourpuss?

738
00:58:20,095 --> 00:58:21,935
You wanna know?

739
00:58:22,015 --> 00:58:24,855
I'll tell you.
A toon killed my brother.

740
00:58:24,935 --> 00:58:26,775
A toon? No.

741
00:58:26,855 --> 00:58:30,136
That's right, a toon.

742
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:33,856
We were investigating a robbery
of the First National Bank of Toontown.

743
00:58:33,935 --> 00:58:37,256
Back in those days,
me and Teddy liked workin' Toontown.

744
00:58:37,335 --> 00:58:40,176
Thought it was a lot of laughs.

745
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:44,016
Anyway, this guy...

746
00:58:44,056 --> 00:58:47,016
got away with a zillion simoleons.

747
00:58:49,777 --> 00:58:53,457
We trailed him to a little dive
down on Yockster Street.

748
00:58:53,497 --> 00:58:55,377
We went in.

749
00:58:57,017 --> 00:58:59,017
Only he got the drop on us.

750
00:58:59,097 --> 00:59:01,456
Literally.

751
00:59:01,497 --> 00:59:04,457
Dropped a piano on us from 15 stories.

752
00:59:06,137 --> 00:59:10,058
Broke my arm.
Teddy never made it.

753
00:59:11,578 --> 00:59:14,497
I never did find out who that guy was.

754
00:59:14,578 --> 00:59:19,218
All I rememberwas, he was
standin' over me, laughin',

755
00:59:19,258 --> 00:59:22,418
with those burnin' red eyes...

756
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:24,818
and that high, squeaky voice.

757
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:29,778
He disappeared into Toontown after that.

758
00:59:29,858 --> 00:59:34,579
No wonder you hate me.

759
00:59:34,619 --> 00:59:38,339
If a toon killed my brother,
I'd hate me too.

760
00:59:38,419 --> 00:59:41,539
Come on, don't cry.
I don't hate ya.

761
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:43,499
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

762
00:59:43,579 --> 00:59:45,459
You do hate me.

763
00:59:45,499 --> 00:59:48,819
Otherwise you wouldn't have
yanked my ears all those times.

764
00:59:48,859 --> 00:59:51,340
All right, I'm...
I'm sorry I yanked your ears.

765
00:59:51,419 --> 00:59:54,060
All the times you yanked my ears?

766
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:56,459
All the times I yanked your ears.

767
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,420
Apology accepted.

768
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,579
Put 'er there, pal.
I feel bet...

769
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:04,060
Oh, boy, I hope it's another cartoon!

770
01:00:04,141 --> 01:00:07,821
Jeepers, another stupid newsreel.

771
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:10,500
I hate the news.

772
01:00:10,581 --> 01:00:12,581
So you got all my stuff?

773
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:17,381
Yes. It's all packed up in the car outside.

774
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:22,021
Would have been here right after you
called, but I had to shake the weasels.

775
01:00:22,101 --> 01:00:26,821
Yeah. I'm sorry
about the trouble in the bar.

776
01:00:26,902 --> 01:00:30,462
Well, hell, stuffing olives
for a livin' wasn't for me anyway.

777
01:00:31,781 --> 01:00:33,622
Dolores?

778
01:00:36,261 --> 01:00:39,062
You ought to find yourself a good man.

779
01:00:42,182 --> 01:00:44,982
But I already have a good man.

780
01:00:51,143 --> 01:00:54,063
P-P-Please, don't mind me.

781
01:00:56,503 --> 01:00:58,383
You better get going, Eddie.

782
01:01:00,983 --> 01:01:02,863
A near miss,

783
01:01:02,903 --> 01:01:05,584
But this miss says,
that's as good as a smile.

784
01:01:05,623 --> 01:01:07,983
California Cloverleaf...

785
01:01:08,024 --> 01:01:11,383
I'm glad Teddy's not here to see me runnin'
away with my tail between my legs.

786
01:01:11,464 --> 01:01:14,864
It's not so bad once you get used to it.

787
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:17,424
The Pacific Red Cartrolley line...

788
01:01:17,464 --> 01:01:20,024
and the venerated Maroon Cartoon Studios,

789
01:01:20,104 --> 01:01:23,224
Here R. K. Maroon is seen
clinching the deal...

790
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:25,824
with Cloverleaf's bankers and execs...

791
01:01:25,904 --> 01:01:29,264
in one of the biggest real estate
deals ever in California history.

792
01:01:29,305 --> 01:01:31,824
- That's it!
- Three and a half million dollars for a...

793
01:01:31,865 --> 01:01:33,864
That's the connection!

794
01:01:41,985 --> 01:01:44,825
Let's forget it, There's nobody here.

795
01:01:44,865 --> 01:01:46,745
Is that it, or are you scared?

796
01:01:46,785 --> 01:01:49,866
P-P-Please! Me scared?
Don't be ridiculous.

797
01:01:51,545 --> 01:01:54,386
When you called Maroon,
you told him you had the will.

798
01:01:54,425 --> 01:01:57,746
But you don't.
When he finds out, he's gonna be mad.

799
01:01:57,826 --> 01:02:00,066
He might try to kill ya.

800
01:02:00,146 --> 01:02:02,026
I can handle a Hollywood cream puff.

801
01:02:02,107 --> 01:02:05,107
I just don't want the odds to change.
You cover my back.

802
01:02:06,706 --> 01:02:09,426
And if you hear or see anything,
beep the horn twice.

803
01:02:09,467 --> 01:02:12,467
Yeah, that's it.
Beep the horn twice. Cover your back.

804
01:02:12,507 --> 01:02:16,947
Boy, I'm ready. Dukes up,
eyes peeled, ears to the ground.

805
01:02:16,987 --> 01:02:20,707
Why, nobody gets the drop on Roger Rabbit.

806
01:02:41,108 --> 01:02:43,068
- Aah!
- What's up, doc?

807
01:02:43,148 --> 01:02:45,149
Valiant, what are you tryin' to do,
give me a heart attack?

808
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:47,469
You need a heart
before you can have an attack.

809
01:02:47,548 --> 01:02:51,228
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ya got the will?
- Sure.

810
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:53,148
I got the will.

811
01:02:54,909 --> 01:02:57,269
Question is, do you have the way?

812
01:02:57,309 --> 01:02:59,909
'Cause I can tell you now,
it ain't gonna come cheap.

813
01:02:59,989 --> 01:03:02,549
You got a lot of brass,
coming up here by yourself.

814
01:03:02,629 --> 01:03:04,510
Who said I'm here by myself?

815
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:17,990
Lemme see that will.

816
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:20,190
- I told you I got it.
- I wanna see it now!

817
01:03:20,190 --> 01:03:21,670
- I told you I got it.
- I wanna see it now!

818
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:28,390
"How do I love thee?
Let me count the ways"?

819
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:31,391
- This supposed to be a joke?
- No. This is.

820
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:38,191
Get up. Come on.

821
01:03:38,271 --> 01:03:41,071
What are you gonna do to me, Valiant?

822
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:44,911
I'm gonna listen to you spin
the Cloverleaf scenario,

823
01:03:44,991 --> 01:03:48,751
the story of greed, sex and murder.

824
01:03:48,831 --> 01:03:52,592
And the parts that I don't like,
I'm gonna edit out.

825
01:03:52,671 --> 01:03:55,872
You got it all wrong.
I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer!

826
01:03:55,952 --> 01:03:58,072
Everybody's gotta have a hobby.

827
01:03:59,112 --> 01:04:01,672
Oh, stop it.
Stop it! Stop it!

828
01:04:01,752 --> 01:04:05,032
The truth is, I had a chance
to sell my studio.

829
01:04:05,113 --> 01:04:08,113
But Cloverleaf wouldn't buy my property
unless Acme sold 'em his.

830
01:04:08,192 --> 01:04:10,033
The stubborn bastard wouldn't sell,

831
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:12,992
so I was gonna blackmail Acme with
pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.

832
01:04:13,073 --> 01:04:16,793
Blackmail, that's all,
I've been around toons all my life.

833
01:04:16,833 --> 01:04:19,753
- I didn't want to see 'em destroyed!
- Toons destroyed?

834
01:04:19,833 --> 01:04:21,993
- Why?
- If I tell ya, I'm a dead man.

835
01:04:22,073 --> 01:04:25,473
- You're a dead man if you don't tell me.
- Unless Acme's will shows...

836
01:04:25,554 --> 01:04:30,553
by midnight tonight, Toontown's
gonna be left for the free... Aah!

837
01:04:53,155 --> 01:04:55,075
Roger!

838
01:05:58,678 --> 01:06:01,118
- What?
- What in Sam Hill?

839
01:06:01,158 --> 01:06:05,279
Eddie Valiant.
Well, you're a sight for sore eyes.

840
01:06:05,318 --> 01:06:09,038
- I ain't seen you to nigh onto five years.
- Where ya been?

841
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:11,039
Drunk.

842
01:06:11,078 --> 01:06:13,359
Feelin' frisky tonight, fellas?

843
01:06:13,439 --> 01:06:15,198
Yeah!

844
01:06:15,279 --> 01:06:17,679
Let's go.

845
01:06:17,759 --> 01:06:20,800
Yahoo!

846
01:07:42,523 --> 01:07:46,323
Hi, Eddie. Hi, Eddie.
Bye, Eddie.

847
01:07:57,764 --> 01:08:01,004
Tallyho! Tallyho!

848
01:08:11,405 --> 01:08:13,285
Get outta here.

849
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:25,565
Going up, sir.

850
01:08:26,885 --> 01:08:28,805
Yah!

851
01:08:30,286 --> 01:08:33,286
Mind the step, sir.

852
01:08:33,325 --> 01:08:36,566
Hold on, sir.

853
01:08:36,646 --> 01:08:39,366
Yah!

854
01:08:42,646 --> 01:08:45,207
Your floor, sir.

855
01:08:45,286 --> 01:08:49,487
Have a good day, sir.

856
01:08:52,847 --> 01:08:55,287
Ah, Gotcha.

857
01:08:59,167 --> 01:09:01,688
A man!

858
01:09:08,207 --> 01:09:10,487
Yoo-hoo, lover-boy!

859
01:09:10,568 --> 01:09:12,568
It's Lena Hyena!

860
01:09:15,848 --> 01:09:17,928
Aah!

861
01:09:18,008 --> 01:09:21,488
Oh, no!

862
01:09:21,569 --> 01:09:24,128
Aah!

863
01:09:28,689 --> 01:09:32,168
- Oh, wook, piggies!
- Hi, Tweety.

864
01:09:32,249 --> 01:09:34,289
This little piggy went to market.

865
01:09:34,369 --> 01:09:36,529
- This little piggy stayed home.
- No.

866
01:09:36,609 --> 01:09:38,809
This little piggy had roast beef.

867
01:09:38,889 --> 01:09:42,010
- And this little piggy had...
- Aah!

868
01:09:42,089 --> 01:09:43,889
Uh-oh. Ran outta piggies.

869
01:09:43,969 --> 01:09:47,170
Yah!

870
01:09:49,169 --> 01:09:51,929
Eh, what's up, doc?
Jumpin' without a parachute?

871
01:09:52,010 --> 01:09:53,850
- Kinda dangerous, ain't it?
- Yeah.

872
01:09:53,930 --> 01:09:57,210
- Yeah, you could get killed.
- You guys got a spare?

873
01:09:57,290 --> 01:09:59,290
- Uh, Bugs does.
- Yeah?

874
01:09:59,370 --> 01:10:01,211
Yeah, but I don't think you want it.

875
01:10:01,290 --> 01:10:03,251
- I do, I do. Give it to me.
- Gee.

876
01:10:03,330 --> 01:10:05,451
- Better let him have it, Bugs.
- Okay, doc.

877
01:10:05,491 --> 01:10:09,011
- Whatever you say. Here's the spare.
- Thank you.

878
01:10:11,731 --> 01:10:15,051
Aw, no! Ahh!

879
01:10:15,171 --> 01:10:18,731
- Aw, poor fella. Ha, ha.
- Yeah. Ain't I a stinker?

880
01:10:18,811 --> 01:10:20,852
Aah!

881
01:10:20,931 --> 01:10:23,771
- My man!

882
01:10:28,052 --> 01:10:30,412
Come to Lena!

883
01:10:35,252 --> 01:10:37,132
Ooh!

884
01:10:37,173 --> 01:10:39,732
Toons. Gets 'em every time.

885
01:10:57,133 --> 01:10:59,413
- Gesund heit.
- Thank you.

886
01:10:59,493 --> 01:11:01,294
Valiant.

887
01:11:06,094 --> 01:11:08,893
I always knew I'd get it in Toontown.

888
01:11:08,974 --> 01:11:12,374
Behind you!

889
01:11:12,454 --> 01:11:15,774
- Drop it, lady.
- I just saved your life
and you still don't trust me?

890
01:11:15,854 --> 01:11:19,214
- I don't trust anybody or anything.
- Not even your own eyes?

891
01:11:19,254 --> 01:11:23,294
That's the gun that killed R. K. Maroon,
And Doom pulled the trigger.

892
01:11:23,375 --> 01:11:27,134
- Doom?
- I followed him to the studio.
But I was too late to stop him.

893
01:11:27,215 --> 01:11:29,334
That's right, You'll never stop me!

894
01:11:29,415 --> 01:11:32,695
- You're dead! You're all dead!
- Doom!

895
01:11:35,215 --> 01:11:37,535
- Which way'd he go?
- Well, I don't know...

896
01:11:37,615 --> 01:11:40,735
- But... He went that away.
- Let's go!

897
01:11:40,816 --> 01:11:43,855
- Dumdums. Yeah.
- Come on.

898
01:11:43,895 --> 01:11:46,816
Oh, no. Where's Roger?

899
01:11:46,895 --> 01:11:50,736
- Roger? He chickened out on me,
back at the studio.
- No, he didn't.

900
01:11:50,816 --> 01:11:54,336
I hit him on the head
with a frying pan and put him in the trunk,
so he wouldn't get hurt.

901
01:11:54,416 --> 01:11:56,256
Makes perfect sense.

902
01:11:56,336 --> 01:11:58,657
We're obviously not going anywhere
in my car, let's take yours.

903
01:12:01,176 --> 01:12:03,216
I got a feeling somebody already did.

904
01:12:03,297 --> 01:12:05,777
From the looks of it, I'd say it was Roger.

905
01:12:05,816 --> 01:12:08,377
My honey-bunny was never
very good behind the wheel.

906
01:12:08,457 --> 01:12:11,897
- A better lover than a driver, huh?
- You'd better believe it, buster.

907
01:12:11,977 --> 01:12:13,817
Uh-oh. It's the weasels.

908
01:12:13,897 --> 01:12:15,737
- This way. We'll take Gingerbread Lane.
- No, wait.

909
01:12:15,817 --> 01:12:17,697
No, no.
Gingerbread Lane's this way.

910
01:12:17,777 --> 01:12:21,457
So Valiant, you call a cab, or what?

911
01:12:21,497 --> 01:12:25,498
Hubba, hubba, hubba.
Allow me, madam-oiselle.

912
01:12:28,017 --> 01:12:30,138
So how long have you known it was Doom?

913
01:12:30,217 --> 01:12:32,818
Before poor Marvin Acme was killed,
he confided in me...

914
01:12:32,898 --> 01:12:36,538
that Doom wanted to get his hands on
Toontown, and he wouldn't stop at anything.

915
01:12:36,578 --> 01:12:39,379
- So he gave you the will for safekeeping?
- That's what he told me.

916
01:12:39,418 --> 01:12:42,819
Except when I opened the envelope, there
was only a blank piece of paper inside.

917
01:12:42,898 --> 01:12:45,499
- Huh. A joker to the end.
- So where to, already?

918
01:12:45,578 --> 01:12:48,699
- My meter's runnin'.
- I have to find my darling husband,

919
01:12:48,779 --> 01:12:50,619
I'm so worried about him.

920
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:54,459
- Seriously, what do you see in that guy?
- He makes me laugh.

921
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:03,859
Aah!

922
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:07,379
Whoa, I've been Dipped!

923
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:15,540
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
What an unfortunate accident.

924
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:18,220
Nothing more treacherous
than a slippery road,

925
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:22,060
especially when driving
in a maniacal toon vehicle.

926
01:13:24,341 --> 01:13:26,180
- Good work, Boss.

927
01:13:26,261 --> 01:13:28,741
Don't just stand there.
Help them.

928
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:31,701
- Put them in my car.
- Follow me.

929
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:35,061
I think they'll enjoy attending
the ribbon cutting at the Acme factory.

930
01:13:35,101 --> 01:13:37,301
Come on, you mugs.

931
01:13:49,182 --> 01:13:52,422
We searched Valiant, Boss.
The will ain't on 'im.

932
01:13:52,502 --> 01:13:54,302
Then frisk the woman!

933
01:13:54,342 --> 01:13:57,023
I'll handle this one.

934
01:14:02,103 --> 01:14:05,743
Nice booby trap.

935
01:14:13,103 --> 01:14:15,423
Do they have the will, or not?

936
01:14:15,503 --> 01:14:17,623
- Nah, just this stupid love letter.
- No matter.

937
01:14:17,663 --> 01:14:22,143
I doubt if that will is going to show up
in the next 15 minutes, anyway.

938
01:14:22,224 --> 01:14:25,784
- What happens in the next 15 minutes?
- Toontown will be legally mine,

939
01:14:25,863 --> 01:14:27,903
lock, stock and barrel.

940
01:14:33,544 --> 01:14:35,985
Benny, is that you?

941
01:14:36,064 --> 01:14:40,505
No, it's Shirley Temple.
Ahh! Oh! Eee!

942
01:14:40,544 --> 01:14:42,425
Jumpin' jeepers, what happened?

943
01:14:42,464 --> 01:14:45,945
Doom grabbed your wife and Valiant
and took 'em to the Acme Factory.

944
01:14:46,024 --> 01:14:48,865
The Acme Factory?
I know where that is. Get in.

945
01:14:48,904 --> 01:14:51,585
Move over, Rog. You've done
enough drivin' for one night.

946
01:14:53,505 --> 01:14:57,265
Duh, Toontown right on
the other side of the wall, Boss.

947
01:14:57,345 --> 01:15:00,345
You see, Mr, Valiant, the
successful conclusion of this case...

948
01:15:00,425 --> 01:15:04,226
draws the curtains on my career
as a jurist in Toontown.

949
01:15:04,265 --> 01:15:07,746
I'm retiring to take a new role
in the private sector.

950
01:15:07,825 --> 01:15:11,386
- That wouldn't be Cloverleaf
Industries, by any chance, eh?
- Uh-uh.

951
01:15:11,466 --> 01:15:14,426
You're looking at the sole stockholder.

952
01:15:18,986 --> 01:15:22,106
Benny, you go for the cops.
I'm gonna save my wife.

953
01:15:22,187 --> 01:15:25,307
Be careful with that gun.
This ain't no cartoon, you know.

954
01:15:25,347 --> 01:15:27,747
This is no way to make a livin'.

955
01:15:29,827 --> 01:15:32,347
Wouldn't you know, locked.

956
01:15:32,427 --> 01:15:34,427
Whoa!

957
01:15:41,828 --> 01:15:44,148
Can you guess what this is?

958
01:15:45,988 --> 01:15:50,428
Oh, my God, it's Dip!

959
01:15:50,468 --> 01:15:54,908
That's right, my dear. Enough to Dip
Toontown off the face of the earth!

960
01:15:57,469 --> 01:16:00,749
Vehicle of my own design.

961
01:16:00,828 --> 01:16:03,788
Five thousand gallons of heated Dip...

962
01:16:03,869 --> 01:16:07,908
pumped at enormous velocity
through a pressurized water cannon.

963
01:16:07,989 --> 01:16:12,269
Toontown will be erased
in a matter of minutes.

964
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:18,349
I suppose you think no one's
going to notice Toontown's disappeared?

965
01:16:18,430 --> 01:16:21,229
Who's got time to wonder what happened
to some ridiculous talking mice...

966
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:25,310
- when you're driving by
at 75 miles an hour?
- What are you talking about?

967
01:16:25,390 --> 01:16:28,270
- There's no road past Toontown.
- Not yet.

968
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:31,630
Several months ago, I had the good
providence to stumble upon...

969
01:16:31,710 --> 01:16:34,230
this plan of the City Counci"s,

970
01:16:34,310 --> 01:16:36,910
a construction plan of epic proportions.

971
01:16:36,990 --> 01:16:41,230
- They are calling it a freeway.
- "Freeway"?

972
01:16:41,311 --> 01:16:44,631
What the hel"s a freeway?

973
01:16:44,751 --> 01:16:47,711
Eight lanes of shimmering cement
running from here to Pasadena.

974
01:16:47,831 --> 01:16:49,831
Smooth, safe, fast.

975
01:16:49,911 --> 01:16:52,711
Traffic jams will be a thing of the past.

976
01:16:52,751 --> 01:16:56,631
So that's why you killed Acme
and Maroon? For this freeway?

977
01:16:56,712 --> 01:16:59,751
- I don't get it.
- Of course not. You lack vision.

978
01:16:59,832 --> 01:17:04,711
I see a place where people
get on and off the freeway.

979
01:17:04,792 --> 01:17:07,112
On and off, off and on,

980
01:17:07,151 --> 01:17:09,992
all day, all night!

981
01:17:10,031 --> 01:17:12,192
Soon, where Toontown once stood, will be...

982
01:17:12,232 --> 01:17:14,632
a string of gas stations,

983
01:17:14,712 --> 01:17:16,552
inexpensive motels,

984
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:19,912
restaurants that serve
rapidly prepared food,

985
01:17:19,993 --> 01:17:21,832
tire salons,

986
01:17:21,913 --> 01:17:24,393
automobile dealerships,

987
01:17:24,472 --> 01:17:27,753
and wonderful, wonderful billboards...

988
01:17:27,833 --> 01:17:31,113
reaching as far as the eye can see!

989
01:17:32,473 --> 01:17:34,434
My God,

990
01:17:34,513 --> 01:17:37,473
- it'll be beautiful.
- Come on.

991
01:17:37,553 --> 01:17:41,674
Nobody's gonna drive this lousy freeway when
they can take the Red Car for a nickel.

992
01:17:41,753 --> 01:17:44,314
Oh, they'll drive.
They'll have to.

993
01:17:44,394 --> 01:17:46,714
You see, I bought the Red Car...

994
01:17:46,793 --> 01:17:49,594
so I could dismantle it.

995
01:17:49,673 --> 01:17:51,994
What the...

996
01:17:57,274 --> 01:18:00,755
- Ay, caramba!
- Aah!

997
01:18:00,875 --> 01:18:03,195
Okay, nobody move.

998
01:18:03,274 --> 01:18:06,075
All right, weasels, grab some sky,
or I let the Judge have it.

999
01:18:06,154 --> 01:18:07,995
You heard me.
I said, drop it.

1000
01:18:08,075 --> 01:18:10,395
- Roger, darling!
- Yes, it's me, my dearest.

1001
01:18:10,475 --> 01:18:14,476
I'd love to embrace you, but first I have to
satisfy my sense of moral outrage.

1002
01:18:14,555 --> 01:18:18,235
- Put the gun down, you bucktoothed fool!
- That's it, Doom.

1003
01:18:18,316 --> 01:18:20,555
Gimme another excuse
to pump ya full of lead.

1004
01:18:20,636 --> 01:18:23,796
You thought you could get away
with it, didn't ya? Ha!

1005
01:18:23,916 --> 01:18:28,036
We toons may act idiotic,
but we're not stupid. We demand justice.

1006
01:18:28,076 --> 01:18:31,716
Why, the real meaning of the word
probably hits you like a ton of bricks.

1007
01:18:33,356 --> 01:18:35,877
Roger!

1008
01:18:35,916 --> 01:18:38,116
Roger, say something.

1009
01:18:38,156 --> 01:18:40,076
Look, stars!

1010
01:18:40,117 --> 01:18:43,357
Ready when you are, Raou.

1011
01:18:43,437 --> 01:18:48,077
Tie the lovebirds together.

1012
01:18:52,437 --> 01:18:54,717
Put them up on that hook.

1013
01:18:54,798 --> 01:18:56,797
Use that escape-proof toonrope.

1014
01:18:56,878 --> 01:18:59,718
Time to kill the rabbit.

1015
01:19:04,118 --> 01:19:06,918
Oh, Roger, you were magnificent.

1016
01:19:06,958 --> 01:19:09,638
- Was I really?
- Better than Goofy.

1017
01:19:21,839 --> 01:19:25,399
Roger, darling,
I want you to know I love you.

1018
01:19:25,479 --> 01:19:29,079
I've loved you more than any woman's
ever loved a rabbit.

1019
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:32,439
It's over, Mr. Valiant.

1020
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:51,280
- Look out, you fools!
- Not... so... fast.

1021
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:55,120
One of these days, you idiots
are gonna laugh yourselves to death!

1022
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:01,841
Shall I "repose" of him right now, Boss?

1023
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:05,681
Let him watch his toon friends
get Dipped. Then shoot him.

1024
01:20:07,601 --> 01:20:09,921
With pleasure.

1025
01:20:15,202 --> 01:20:18,082
Everything's funny to you, ain't it,
needle-nose?

1026
01:20:18,161 --> 01:20:22,122
You got a problem with that, Valiant?

1027
01:20:22,202 --> 01:20:24,082
No.

1028
01:20:24,122 --> 01:20:28,682
I just, uh, want you to know somethin'
about the guy you're gonna Dip.

1029
01:20:51,323 --> 01:20:54,363
- He's lost his mind.
- I don't think so.

1030
01:21:06,484 --> 01:21:08,324
Thanks.

1031
01:21:22,724 --> 01:21:26,765
Aah!

1032
01:21:32,485 --> 01:21:35,805
Hey, Eddie, keep it up,

1033
01:21:35,925 --> 01:21:39,205
You're killin' 'em! You're slayin' 'em!
You're knockin' 'em dead!

1034
01:21:52,966 --> 01:21:55,406
- Nose!
- "Nose"?

1035
01:21:55,486 --> 01:21:57,527
That don't rhyme with "walls".

1036
01:21:57,606 --> 01:22:01,367
- No. But this does.

1037
01:22:16,728 --> 01:22:18,728
Yikes! Oh, my goodness!

1038
01:22:20,568 --> 01:22:24,728
- Jeepers, that was close!

1039
01:22:29,528 --> 01:22:32,288
Bye-bye.

1040
01:22:32,369 --> 01:22:35,089
Eddie, hurry!
It's coming back!

1041
01:22:48,449 --> 01:22:50,849
Oh!

1042
01:22:50,929 --> 01:22:53,890
- Oh, no!
- This is it!

1043
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:55,810
- No!
- This isn't it.

1044
01:22:58,690 --> 01:23:00,970
Whoa!

1045
01:23:47,132 --> 01:23:49,892
Don't move.

1046
01:23:52,893 --> 01:23:54,572
No! No!

1047
01:24:32,014 --> 01:24:34,855
Yah!

1048
01:24:55,696 --> 01:24:57,336
Oh, no!

1049
01:25:01,976 --> 01:25:05,216
Come on, Eddie!
Quit playin' around!

1050
01:25:05,296 --> 01:25:07,896
- No! Oh! No!
- Yah! P-P-Please!

1051
01:25:11,816 --> 01:25:15,137
I wasn't worried.
Were you?

1052
01:25:32,537 --> 01:25:34,817
- Eddie, look!
- Look!

1053
01:25:48,898 --> 01:25:51,738
Holy smoke, he's a toon!

1054
01:25:51,778 --> 01:25:54,659
- Surprised?
- Not really.

1055
01:25:54,738 --> 01:25:58,779
That lamebrain freeway idea
could only be cooked up by a toon.

1056
01:25:58,819 --> 01:26:01,659
Not just any toon.

1057
01:26:17,619 --> 01:26:20,420
Remember me, Eddie?

1058
01:26:20,499 --> 01:26:24,060
When I killed your brother, I talked...

1059
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:26,780
just... like... this!

1060
01:26:33,901 --> 01:26:37,501
Jumpin' jeepers! Oh!

1061
01:26:43,261 --> 01:26:45,821
- Yikes!
- Oh, my goodness! Oh, no!

1062
01:27:13,222 --> 01:27:15,863
Huh?

1063
01:27:46,864 --> 01:27:48,744
Good-bye, my darling.
Good-bye!

1064
01:27:53,784 --> 01:27:58,145
Oh! I think I'm gonna faint.

1065
01:28:04,466 --> 01:28:08,865
Oh, no! Oh, no!

1066
01:28:08,986 --> 01:28:12,946
I'm melting!

1067
01:28:16,586 --> 01:28:19,346
I'm melting! Melting!

1068
01:28:19,425 --> 01:28:23,266
Oh, no!

1069
01:28:28,106 --> 01:28:32,906
Eddie, do something!

1070
01:28:33,026 --> 01:28:37,707
Hurry up, Eddie!
Do something!

1071
01:29:08,148 --> 01:29:12,788
Eddie, there's Dip everywhere!
How are we gonna get down?

1072
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:40,310
Jeepers, Eddie, that was a close save.

1073
01:29:40,390 --> 01:29:43,110
I thought for sure our goose was cooked.

1074
01:29:43,150 --> 01:29:45,590
Oh!

1075
01:29:45,710 --> 01:29:48,070
My hero!

1076
01:29:48,151 --> 01:29:50,550
- Oh, honey-bunny.
- Oh, love-cup.

1077
01:29:50,631 --> 01:29:53,311
Oh, Roger!

1078
01:29:53,390 --> 01:29:56,071
You were a pillar of strength.

1079
01:29:59,631 --> 01:30:04,551
Sister Mary Francis!
What the hell happened in here?

1080
01:30:07,951 --> 01:30:09,511
I've been a cab for 37 years,

1081
01:30:09,511 --> 01:30:10,431
I've been a cab for 37 years,

1082
01:30:10,512 --> 01:30:13,392
and I've never seen a mess like this!

1083
01:30:13,431 --> 01:30:15,751
What was that, a rubbermask?

1084
01:30:15,792 --> 01:30:19,432
Yeah, and this is the rope
from the safe that was dropped on Acme.

1085
01:30:19,472 --> 01:30:22,912
I think your lab boys will find
that paint's a perfect match.

1086
01:30:22,992 --> 01:30:25,193
Judge Doom killed Marvin Acme.

1087
01:30:25,232 --> 01:30:28,232
And R.K. Maroon and my brother.

1088
01:30:28,272 --> 01:30:32,232
That's what I call one
seriously disturbed toon.

1089
01:30:37,793 --> 01:30:40,432
Gosh, uh, I wonder who he really was.

1090
01:30:40,513 --> 01:30:44,113
- I tell you one thing, doc.
He weren't no rabbit.
- Or a duck.

1091
01:30:44,193 --> 01:30:46,193
- Or a dog.
- Or a little wooden boy.

1092
01:30:46,273 --> 01:30:49,194
- Or a sheep.
- Or a woodpecker.
- Or a pussy.

1093
01:30:49,233 --> 01:30:51,713
What's that? What is that?

1094
01:30:51,794 --> 01:30:55,793
It's ink. That goof Acme squirted me
with some the other night.

1095
01:30:55,874 --> 01:30:58,953
- Why it's comin' out now, I don't know,
- Here's your answer, Eddie.

1096
01:30:58,994 --> 01:31:01,394
Acme Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.

1097
01:31:01,434 --> 01:31:05,354
- Boy, that Acme. What a genius!
- Applesauce!

1098
01:31:05,394 --> 01:31:08,834
If he was such a genius, why didn't he
leave his will where we could find it?

1099
01:31:08,915 --> 01:31:11,835
Without it, we're just waitin'
for another developer's wrecking ball.

1100
01:31:11,955 --> 01:31:14,194
- Roger, that love letter
you wrote to your wife...
- Yeah?

1101
01:31:14,275 --> 01:31:16,875
In the Ink and Paint Club...
why don't you read it to her now?

1102
01:31:16,955 --> 01:31:18,835
Sure, Eddie.

1103
01:31:18,875 --> 01:31:20,915
"Dear Jessica, How do I love thee?

1104
01:31:20,995 --> 01:31:25,635
Let me count the ways.
I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body..."

1105
01:31:25,715 --> 01:31:27,755
- It's the will!
- Keep reading.

1106
01:31:27,795 --> 01:31:30,275
"Do hereby bequeath inperpetuity..

1107
01:31:30,356 --> 01:31:34,836
the property known as Toontown to
those loveable characters, the toons!"

1108
01:31:46,836 --> 01:31:50,116
Hey, Eddie, that was a pretty
funny dance you did for the weasels.

1109
01:31:50,197 --> 01:31:52,797
Do you think your days
of bein' a sourpuss are over?

1110
01:31:52,876 --> 01:31:54,717
Only time will tell.

1111
01:31:54,796 --> 01:31:57,277
- Yeah, well, put it there, pal.
- Yeah.

1112
01:32:06,237 --> 01:32:10,037
Don't tell me you lost
your sense of humor already.

1113
01:32:13,078 --> 01:32:15,118
Does this answer your question?

1114
01:32:17,238 --> 01:32:21,078
- Blech! Bleah!

1115
01:32:21,158 --> 01:32:23,358
Come on, Roger, let's go home.

1116
01:32:23,439 --> 01:32:25,359
I'll bake you a carrot cake.

1117
01:32:52,959 --> 01:32:54,840
Okay, m-m-move along.

1118
01:32:54,879 --> 01:32:57,400
T-T-There's nothing else to see.
That's all, folks.

1119
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:59,920
Hmm. I like the sound of that.

1120
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,680
T-T-T-T-That's all, folks!
