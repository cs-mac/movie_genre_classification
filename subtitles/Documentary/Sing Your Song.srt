1
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,599
Introduction

2
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:59,153
Who am I? City Hunter is my nickname
fighting crimes is the game.

3
00:00:59,314 --> 00:01:01,472
I work alone I'm a private detective.

4
00:01:02,231 --> 00:01:04,509
My sidekick comes along also

5
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:07,586
But, I'm better at kung fu and much cuter...

6
00:01:08,225 --> 00:01:09,703
smarter too.

7
00:01:10,343 --> 00:01:11,542
I'm taller as well.

8
00:01:11,582 --> 00:01:12,661
He's too humble.

9
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:15,338
Oh! we're best friends. We have been through a lot.

10
00:01:21,253 --> 00:01:22,352
Invincible!

11
00:01:22,732 --> 00:01:27,568
One time when he was alone he did slip
up though...  big time. Huh?

12
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:38,677
You're shot!

13
00:01:40,954 --> 00:01:42,952
Are you okay? How do you feel?

14
00:01:43,152 --> 00:01:45,549
How would you feel if you're hit by 20 shots?

15
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,148
Hey, you have to try, promise you won't die.

16
00:01:48,587 --> 00:01:50,186
Um... there is one thing...

17
00:01:50,385 --> 00:01:52,583
Take care of my cousin Kaori, I'd appreciate it.

18
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:00,096
Ok, because you're a pal, I'll do it.
It can't be any worse of getting shot.

19
00:02:00,336 --> 00:02:03,053
One more thing, never seduce her.

20
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,208
No! I swear on it, scouts honor.

21
00:02:09,727 --> 00:02:11,526
Ok, I can die in peace.

22
00:02:13,963 --> 00:02:15,042
So sad...

23
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:21,017
From that day forward, Kaori became my only family.

24
00:02:21,436 --> 00:02:26,831
One thing I had overlooked however,
was how quickly little girls grow up.

25
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:31,307
One second they're cute innocent youngsters,
than you turn your back on them for a moment and...

26
00:02:36,621 --> 00:02:37,820
Not fair.

27
00:02:42,735 --> 00:02:45,613
Why did I ever swear that I wouldn't seduce Kaori?

28
00:02:46,173 --> 00:02:50,009
I bet if he was still alive
my old friend would understand if I did?

29
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:51,647
Not.

30
00:02:54,604 --> 00:02:58,680
Because of the promise I made,
Kaori has never been more than my assistant.

31
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,397
And I never suspected how she truly felt about me.

32
00:03:02,597 --> 00:03:03,796
Until one day...

33
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,589
Why doesn't he answer?

34
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,018
Come on, wake up now.

35
00:04:08,614 --> 00:04:11,012
Come on, you're too lazy, get up.

36
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:19,804
You won't do it, prefer to get a little wet...
no pool in here, so you're not drowning, are ya?

37
00:04:22,202 --> 00:04:25,678
City Hunter tell me, won't your girlfriend get
jealous if you're here with us?

38
00:04:26,398 --> 00:04:29,195
What, her? She's not a girlfriend at all...

39
00:04:29,674 --> 00:04:32,192
Right now she's at home cleaning the toilet.

40
00:04:32,232 --> 00:04:34,190
You mean me? I'm doing what?

41
00:04:35,469 --> 00:04:37,347
Tell us about your job.

42
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:41,343
So fat I have to carry her on a wagon and...

43
00:04:41,504 --> 00:04:43,262
Oh! she likes to eat.

44
00:04:43,461 --> 00:04:45,060
She has seven meals daily.

45
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:47,817
And she misbehaves very bad.

46
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:51,214
Then, when she wakes up, she wants to go out.

47
00:04:53,452 --> 00:04:56,768
Tongue out, paws up, back and forth.

48
00:04:59,406 --> 00:05:03,842
She's useless, I'd give her away
but I feel too sorry for her.

49
00:05:03,962 --> 00:05:05,160
Impossible!

50
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:10,037
Do it.

51
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,706
Wake up, will you? Come on,
I'm tired of holding your head up.

52
00:05:23,344 --> 00:05:25,342
He's City Hunter, I'm his assistant Kaori.

53
00:05:25,502 --> 00:05:27,420
Mr. Imamura set for us.

54
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,646
Wake up, you're in the middle of an office
and you haven't stirred yet, understand?

55
00:05:42,205 --> 00:05:43,205
Wake up!

56
00:05:43,404 --> 00:05:45,802
Will anything wake you?

57
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:52,036
That aroma, such perfect skin.

58
00:05:52,237 --> 00:05:53,915
You're a model I'd guess? - Oh, no.

59
00:05:54,035 --> 00:05:55,114
Then what?

60
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,512
A secretary.

61
00:05:56,592 --> 00:05:57,791
Fascinating.

62
00:06:05,124 --> 00:06:07,363
Somebody call my tailor.

63
00:06:08,141 --> 00:06:09,460
Day dreaming?

64
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:10,858
What do you care?

65
00:06:12,217 --> 00:06:17,413
As to why I brought you here,
I'm Mr. Imamura, owner of Imamura newspaper.

66
00:06:17,812 --> 00:06:18,891
My daughter Kiyoko.

67
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:24,206
She lost her mother early, and I brought the girl up alone.

68
00:06:24,246 --> 00:06:27,004
She's an only child and is a bit rebellious

69
00:06:27,403 --> 00:06:32,238
I met a woman last year, we're in love with
each other and we intend to wed.

70
00:06:32,718 --> 00:06:35,516
Kiyoko coudn't stand the idea and ran away.

71
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:40,071
After a very discreet probe,
we learned she was staying in Hong Kong.

72
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,949
I suppose you'll pay for her return.

73
00:06:43,628 --> 00:06:46,465
You aren't to use any force, or to harm her.

74
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:49,462
He's extremely gentle with the pretty ones.

75
00:07:14,838 --> 00:07:16,756
I know. But have you seen her anywhere?

76
00:07:17,476 --> 00:07:18,874
Perhaps you'd like a shirt.

77
00:07:19,034 --> 00:07:19,713
Where?

78
00:07:19,874 --> 00:07:21,272
Or would you rather a surprise?

79
00:07:21,471 --> 00:07:24,389
What skateboarding you say? What park? What gang is that?

80
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:26,447
Olsen Park?

81
00:07:26,507 --> 00:07:27,986
Got it.

82
00:07:28,745 --> 00:07:30,064
Ever been on the ocean?

83
00:07:30,903 --> 00:07:31,902
Ok.

84
00:07:32,021 --> 00:07:34,500
A voyage at sea and all around stars.

85
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:37,776
Yeah, you know it. Stay in touch now, will ya? Yeah OK.

86
00:07:38,975 --> 00:07:39,775
Were you saying something?

87
00:07:39,895 --> 00:07:41,813
You never hear a thing I say.

88
00:07:41,808 --> 00:07:43,308
Ah!  how can you... Ahhh!

89
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:47,407
Have another pina colada.

90
00:07:48,287 --> 00:07:51,603
I'll go to Olsen Park. You check all the
amusment galleries and beauty parlors.

91
00:07:51,803 --> 00:07:52,402
Go ahead.

92
00:07:52,682 --> 00:07:54,001
Oh, and don't slam the door.

93
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,638
If you see her, call.

94
00:07:57,317 --> 00:07:59,536
You drive me nuts!

95
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,548
That's it. Great. Like your car?

96
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:10,786
Well, I don't like it.
Think you got the right to the whole road?

97
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:13,142
Yeah, that's right. Back off!

98
00:08:14,741 --> 00:08:16,540
Who cares about your birthday?

99
00:08:30,087 --> 00:08:31,786
So when are you and me going out?

100
00:08:31,825 --> 00:08:34,523
We aren't going out. Just forget that.

101
00:08:34,663 --> 00:08:36,282
Come on, we need to disco.

102
00:08:36,481 --> 00:08:38,479
We'll go dancing another time.

103
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:49,468
Sorry.

104
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:01,936
Hey! a bit of good luck. I found you pretty fast.

105
00:09:03,495 --> 00:09:04,574
What?

106
00:09:04,654 --> 00:09:07,651
Come along, and just go quiet, ok?

107
00:09:07,884 --> 00:09:11,684
My nose oow oow oow Huh?

108
00:09:14,285 --> 00:09:15,483
Wait a minute!

109
00:09:17,162 --> 00:09:17,962
What's the matter?

110
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:20,199
That man tryed to molest me, stop him. Huh?

111
00:09:22,098 --> 00:09:23,636
That's far enough. Huh?

112
00:09:25,674 --> 00:09:26,873
Bastard stole it.

113
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,112
Go on!

114
00:11:02,623 --> 00:11:04,161
Oh! Beg your pardon.

115
00:11:18,568 --> 00:11:20,285
Hi, there. Pretty.

116
00:11:27,838 --> 00:11:31,036
Excuse me. Hey, there sexy. You got a minute?

117
00:11:31,038 --> 00:11:31,955
You, Ah?

118
00:11:33,314 --> 00:11:35,532
You, Ah? You bet, handsome.

119
00:11:35,831 --> 00:11:36,910
Alright.

120
00:12:27,062 --> 00:12:28,021
I'm starving.

121
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:29,819
I haven't eaten all day.

122
00:12:30,219 --> 00:12:31,418
Are you here or not?

123
00:12:32,415 --> 00:12:33,615
Gotta' chow down.

124
00:12:33,616 --> 00:12:34,935
My poor stomach. Huh?

125
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:36,853
My birthday?

126
00:12:37,612 --> 00:12:40,410
So sad... My birthday and nothing to eat.

127
00:12:43,767 --> 00:12:44,846
A cracker.

128
00:12:47,003 --> 00:12:50,001
Kaori, make me some lunch.

129
00:12:52,977 --> 00:12:55,356
Surprise! It's your birthday!

130
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,268
Happy Birthday!

131
00:13:03,348 --> 00:13:04,307
How fun.

132
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:06,465
You're all really here.

133
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:07,704
City Hunter!

134
00:13:07,784 --> 00:13:08,902
Who are you?

135
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:10,741
Have we met?

136
00:13:10,821 --> 00:13:11,821
It doesn't matter.

137
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,939
I want some cake.

138
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:16,455
No, once I've tied you up you can taste it.

139
00:13:18,334 --> 00:13:19,773
Let's go for it, come on.

140
00:13:21,651 --> 00:13:22,809
Whatever you girls want.

141
00:13:24,348 --> 00:13:26,326
What? Try again. That was a little high.

142
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:29,484
You should try again. We've never met you before today.

143
00:13:29,723 --> 00:13:31,282
Is that right? Well glad to know you all.

144
00:13:31,481 --> 00:13:33,280
You put all of our men into jail.

145
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:34,159
Now you'll pay.

146
00:13:34,318 --> 00:13:35,397
Go on.

147
00:13:42,231 --> 00:13:43,990
Wait. Hold it.

148
00:13:50,224 --> 00:13:51,822
We got him now. Grab him.

149
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,660
Hey!

150
00:13:56,178 --> 00:13:58,775
Lay down your weapons. Don't move.

151
00:14:01,652 --> 00:14:02,892
Surprise

152
00:14:05,968 --> 00:14:06,848
Oh, good.

153
00:14:07,008 --> 00:14:08,327
Who are those women?

154
00:14:08,245 --> 00:14:08,845
Huh? Them?

155
00:14:08,846 --> 00:14:11,243
They're a bunch of murderesses. That's who they are.

156
00:14:11,404 --> 00:14:15,160
Yeah, and I guess you're scared to death. You got a gun.

157
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:19,596
Hmm? This?

158
00:14:19,635 --> 00:14:22,033
Who is she? That girl.

159
00:14:22,433 --> 00:14:25,030
Really?

160
00:14:25,071 --> 00:14:26,469
Here catch, birthday boy.

161
00:14:29,267 --> 00:14:30,665
You're despicable.

162
00:14:33,902 --> 00:14:36,100
I'll sail away on a cruise. I won't be back.

163
00:14:37,178 --> 00:14:39,178
Hey! wait Kaori.

164
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:43,311
Ugh! I'll give you what for.

165
00:14:44,612 --> 00:14:46,171
A hero drop the gun.

166
00:14:48,448 --> 00:14:49,568
Good.

167
00:14:51,645 --> 00:14:53,404
You'll find out what I've got.

168
00:15:17,781 --> 00:15:21,197
You were right... City Hunter is such a stupid fool.

169
00:15:22,736 --> 00:15:26,131
Squinty eyed. Losing his hair. His ears are huge.

170
00:15:27,131 --> 00:15:28,231
He's tiring.

171
00:15:28,232 --> 00:15:31,328
Now I have great charm. he's clumsy.

172
00:15:33,486 --> 00:15:35,005
A new fashion?

173
00:15:38,081 --> 00:15:39,640
I'll take ya.. both on

174
00:15:41,678 --> 00:15:42,877
I'm sorry.

175
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,391
Look who's taking a vacation

176
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,909
Now I'd guess that you guys are all sharing a state room.

177
00:15:54,226 --> 00:15:56,944
You should really shine your head a little more often.

178
00:15:57,103 --> 00:16:00,021
Where as You will always be ugly.

179
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,497
Are you familiar with all your pressure points
like the one in your back?

180
00:16:08,013 --> 00:16:09,412
Ooh! Lost your pants.

181
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:18,843
Kaori.

182
00:16:20,801 --> 00:16:21,920
Hey! wait for me.

183
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,262
I'll be right there.

184
00:16:40,382 --> 00:16:41,901
Come on, foxy lady.

185
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,218
Hi, I was getting worried.

186
00:16:46,057 --> 00:16:47,336
We don't wanna be late.

187
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,095
Sorry. Let's hurry.

188
00:16:50,573 --> 00:16:52,171
Why is God so cruel?

189
00:16:59,844 --> 00:17:01,683
He's cute. Who's the guy?

190
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:03,520
He's City Hunter. A big fool.

191
00:17:03,601 --> 00:17:05,479
Ooh! a private eye?

192
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:06,958
He's a pain in the ass, really.

193
00:17:17,268 --> 00:17:21,383
Kaori... Hey!

194
00:17:22,663 --> 00:17:24,101
Go right on board.

195
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,619
You have something you'd like to show me?

196
00:17:27,418 --> 00:17:28,417
There you go.

197
00:17:28,577 --> 00:17:31,175
This is gum. I need to see your pass.

198
00:17:31,374 --> 00:17:32,773
Right you are. Invitation, please.

199
00:17:33,732 --> 00:17:35,211
A magician, that's great.

200
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:40,486
Wait. There's something odd.

201
00:17:42,244 --> 00:17:44,202
Mah Jong club membership?

202
00:17:49,717 --> 00:17:51,715
I really hate it when this happens.

203
00:17:56,691 --> 00:17:57,670
Thanks.

204
00:18:36,153 --> 00:18:37,472
Oh! I need to eat something.

205
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:43,506
I'm so clever.

206
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:46,743
Oh! I'm starving.

207
00:19:10,061 --> 00:19:11,839
Ah, Beg your pardon. Where do I eat?

208
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:13,418
Ah, Yes, you...

209
00:19:14,197 --> 00:19:15,395
I'll be going. Wait.

210
00:19:15,596 --> 00:19:17,894
Don't panic the passengers, but get that stowaway

211
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:51,721
Hey, there. Drink?

212
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,077
Anyone? Care for a drink?

213
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,195
Thank you.

214
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:21,693
You looked upr her skirt

215
00:20:21,812 --> 00:20:23,212
You're filthy.

216
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,849
No don't step on the bread.

217
00:20:30,844 --> 00:20:32,323
Are you blind?

218
00:20:38,357 --> 00:20:41,834
I demand you apologize. Go on.

219
00:20:43,152 --> 00:20:44,471
There he is. Go that way.

220
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,429
Here.

221
00:20:49,427 --> 00:20:51,825
You see him? - No.  Odd.

222
00:20:52,464 --> 00:20:53,623
We can't give up.

223
00:20:53,663 --> 00:20:55,261
Look everywhere. Right.

224
00:20:59,178 --> 00:21:00,776
A ship! Blow the siren now!

225
00:21:00,856 --> 00:21:01,775
Ay.

226
00:21:29,269 --> 00:21:30,268
Wow.

227
00:21:32,665 --> 00:21:34,065
Beautiful room.

228
00:21:34,304 --> 00:21:35,503
Put away the luggage.

229
00:21:42,896 --> 00:21:44,894
Gimme a hand.

230
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,010
You fall again?

231
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,809
I always lose my balance.

232
00:21:51,328 --> 00:21:53,646
Yeah. Up you go.

233
00:21:58,241 --> 00:22:01,239
You know what? I like living in style.

234
00:22:01,678 --> 00:22:05,635
I heard this boat is filled with lots of single guys.

235
00:22:06,154 --> 00:22:10,310
Yeah, what if one came along  who is rich and is just perfect?

236
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,988
Hey now, what is your mission?

237
00:22:13,307 --> 00:22:15,505
I provide you with a cover.

238
00:22:15,745 --> 00:22:18,742
I forgot. Is there a reward if you solve this case?

239
00:22:18,902 --> 00:22:19,622
Sure there is.

240
00:22:19,661 --> 00:22:23,377
If our information about a gang robbing
the boat is correct and we stop them.

241
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,215
We get our money once they're caught?

242
00:22:26,575 --> 00:22:29,212
I was sent to investigate by my superiors.

243
00:22:29,252 --> 00:22:30,851
To see if the information is right.

244
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,688
Did you bring me a gun?

245
00:22:34,327 --> 00:22:35,526
Sure thing.

246
00:23:39,266 --> 00:23:40,584
Watch it. Don't hit me.

247
00:23:41,025 --> 00:23:42,023
You're late.

248
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:44,181
We got caught in traffic.

249
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,058
Hey, what a beautiful room.

250
00:23:49,856 --> 00:23:51,774
This is gonna do perfectly.

251
00:23:53,052 --> 00:23:56,649
You bastard. I'm gonna warn you once. Don't be late again.

252
00:23:57,089 --> 00:23:59,607
Don't get uptight. Just relax.

253
00:23:59,727 --> 00:24:01,325
And lets Try to enjoy ourselves.

254
00:24:02,844 --> 00:24:04,243
Till midnight.

255
00:24:16,031 --> 00:24:19,108
Always having your mouth full won't attract a lot of men.

256
00:24:19,467 --> 00:24:21,466
I'm hungry. I coudn't wait.

257
00:24:30,657 --> 00:24:33,295
Am I at a convention or mimes or is my hearing gone bad?

258
00:24:33,454 --> 00:24:37,171
Must have been the fall I took Ahh! Food.

259
00:24:41,047 --> 00:24:45,563
Hey, there's that cute guy.
He looks like he's lost, doesn't he?

260
00:24:45,883 --> 00:24:49,200
He's barely human. In fact he's repulsive.

261
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,478
Hi!

262
00:24:52,276 --> 00:24:54,075
Be more discreet!

263
00:24:54,275 --> 00:24:55,834
Embarassed? Ha!

264
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:31,960
He is reputed to be an infamous sex feind.

265
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:33,797
I never met a man who wasn't.

266
00:25:34,037 --> 00:25:35,716
He's always flirting.

267
00:25:36,075 --> 00:25:37,874
He'll need some training.

268
00:25:37,993 --> 00:25:39,392
No money at all.

269
00:25:42,829 --> 00:25:45,426
Hamburger, come back. I want mine on a bun.

270
00:25:49,543 --> 00:25:50,541
Nice, huh?

271
00:25:50,622 --> 00:25:51,980
Yeah.

272
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,097
Just wait. They'll be ours.

273
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,214
That way. Hurry up... Come on.

274
00:25:59,014 --> 00:25:59,892
Sorry.

275
00:26:16,517 --> 00:26:21,352
But why? You know that we're supposed
to be lovers. It's written in the stars up above.

276
00:26:21,512 --> 00:26:25,509
And will vow never to let the name
of City Hunter be spoken. Never again.

277
00:26:27,387 --> 00:26:29,185
You know that he'll come to find me.

278
00:26:29,345 --> 00:26:31,542
He can't. How could even get here?

279
00:26:31,662 --> 00:26:33,781
He gonna fly? We're at sea!

280
00:26:33,901 --> 00:26:35,220
Kaori.

281
00:26:39,695 --> 00:26:40,854
Hurry, protect me.

282
00:26:41,334 --> 00:26:42,692
Move and die.

283
00:26:43,212 --> 00:26:44,212
Who is that?

284
00:26:56,439 --> 00:26:57,614
Where are your six girlfriends?

285
00:26:57,638 --> 00:26:59,077
Couldn't they come?

286
00:27:00,276 --> 00:27:01,530
Are you talking? I can't hear one thing.

287
00:27:01,554 --> 00:27:03,393
You know him. My cousin says go away.

288
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,551
Oh, it's scary. Not a single thing is getting in.

289
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:08,268
You're absolutely right. You refuse to hear.

290
00:27:10,066 --> 00:27:11,865
Will I return?

291
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,823
You reform, no more flirting.

292
00:27:13,903 --> 00:27:15,581
You can't sleep with other girls.

293
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:18,019
And you treat me like a queen.

294
00:27:19,178 --> 00:27:21,655
I can't hear a single thing. Please repeat it.

295
00:27:21,775 --> 00:27:23,213
Bastard. You're being so cruel.

296
00:27:32,005 --> 00:27:33,204
Watch it, buddy.

297
00:27:33,763 --> 00:27:36,362
If my cousin weren't here, I'd put you on the floor.

298
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:39,438
Cowards quake when they face the Dragon's Claw.

299
00:27:39,998 --> 00:27:41,077
Huh! Yeah

300
00:27:41,556 --> 00:27:42,635
Let's go.

301
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,194
Watch it.

302
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,071
- That's true.
- Honest?

303
00:27:47,871 --> 00:27:50,748
- Yeah. I slept with them all.
- Everyone? The whole team?

304
00:27:50,787 --> 00:27:51,947
Not with the coach.

305
00:27:52,466 --> 00:27:53,945
I can hear everything now.

306
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,350
Mine's eight.

307
00:28:13,167 --> 00:28:15,165
Banker has nine. Banker wins.

308
00:28:16,345 --> 00:28:17,323
Alright!

309
00:28:18,682 --> 00:28:20,160
Nine, won.

310
00:28:22,317 --> 00:28:25,914
Didn't I tell you? He is a winner.

311
00:28:26,394 --> 00:28:29,994
Yeah. Just you watch. You stay with the banker.

312
00:28:33,487 --> 00:28:37,483
Welcome. Ah, wait, it doesn't make any sense at all.

313
00:28:37,543 --> 00:28:39,362
Why stay in separate rooms?

314
00:28:39,461 --> 00:28:42,998
You know that all great love affairs
must be given an opportunity.

315
00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:44,616
And ours is no different.

316
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:47,294
My room, or better yours?

317
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:48,613
Alright, you sleep in my room.

318
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:52,090
Alright.

319
00:28:52,329 --> 00:28:53,728
And I'll stay in yours.

320
00:28:57,724 --> 00:28:59,482
Oh, she is gone.

321
00:28:59,882 --> 00:29:02,520
But, no. I will still woo her for eternity.

322
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:07,036
It doesn't matter. A soul as pure as mine
will never feel despirited.

323
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:10,692
I'm gonna make love to you, baby. Cause I'm so potent.

324
00:29:10,733 --> 00:29:15,148
Potent. I'm a potent hunk of man.
And I'm gonna show you all my charms.

325
00:29:15,188 --> 00:29:18,465
You're Jane and I'm your Tarzan.

326
00:29:20,023 --> 00:29:23,860
I'll possess her. On a chariot ride straight to heaven.

327
00:29:23,685 --> 00:29:27,685
Go man, you'll get her someday.

328
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:28,485
Let's do a little gambling.

329
00:32:29,005 --> 00:32:30,503
Don't forget, we're on a mission.

330
00:32:30,603 --> 00:32:34,080
Oh, spoil sport. We can be looking for clues when we've won.

331
00:32:37,716 --> 00:32:41,933
That man right there is cute. He could be wealthy.

332
00:32:42,032 --> 00:32:44,629
Oh, he is. And I can tell you something else.

333
00:32:44,669 --> 00:32:45,868
I know that he's dangerous.

334
00:32:45,909 --> 00:32:47,307
But, gorgeous.

335
00:32:47,906 --> 00:32:49,105
He means trouble.

336
00:32:50,205 --> 00:32:53,201
In fact, murders another thing he plays.

337
00:32:58,416 --> 00:32:59,416
It's a seven.

338
00:32:59,576 --> 00:33:01,674
Huh? Yeah, yeah.

339
00:33:04,631 --> 00:33:05,530
An eight, he wins.

340
00:33:05,589 --> 00:33:07,608
You win again? I think you cheat.

341
00:33:08,268 --> 00:33:10,466
I was polite. But losers are.

342
00:33:11,164 --> 00:33:12,363
- Search him.
- Yes, sir.

343
00:33:17,798 --> 00:33:18,977
Alright.

344
00:33:45,292 --> 00:33:46,911
Stop! What's going on?

345
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:49,288
Self defense. Here, it's a tip.

346
00:33:50,248 --> 00:33:51,346
Put this out, will ya?

347
00:33:51,426 --> 00:33:53,125
And cash me out, please.

348
00:33:53,244 --> 00:33:54,643
It's alright. Ok.

349
00:33:54,723 --> 00:33:55,802
Thanks very much.

350
00:33:55,922 --> 00:33:57,481
Your ace fell.

351
00:34:00,556 --> 00:34:03,415
Yep, um, It's all yours. Bye.

352
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:08,350
Hey? Why did he have to give that card to you?

353
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,829
Good taste Dear.

354
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,672
Hm! Yeah right!

355
00:34:26,573 --> 00:34:28,292
We must all pick the time.

356
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:30,489
Twenty nine minutes until midnight.

357
00:34:30,972 --> 00:34:33,672
In twenty nine minutes we begin.

358
00:34:47,273 --> 00:34:49,931
I want team A in place in 4 minutes Ted.

359
00:34:49,966 --> 00:34:51,130
Got it, boss.

360
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:54,367
Mike, you and team B will start in 9 minutes.

361
00:34:54,387 --> 00:34:55,387
Right.

362
00:34:56,904 --> 00:35:00,121
While we watch some beautiful girls. Sounds good... Yeah!

363
00:35:05,496 --> 00:35:06,895
Your balls are in a knot.

364
00:35:06,934 --> 00:35:10,172
Come morning you're gonna be rich men so keep cool.

365
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:12,950
Beter listen up, he's got a full proof plan.

366
00:35:18,884 --> 00:35:19,884
Ok.

367
00:35:20,242 --> 00:35:22,680
I have sixty names written down on this page.

368
00:35:23,439 --> 00:35:25,317
All of them are millionaires.

369
00:35:25,557 --> 00:35:28,115
We grab them and their money as well.

370
00:35:28,235 --> 00:35:29,513
What about the others?

371
00:35:33,171 --> 00:35:36,867
Well, the sharks get hungry. So throw 'em some food.

372
00:35:49,174 --> 00:35:50,973
Take a look over there.

373
00:35:51,493 --> 00:35:52,451
Yes, boss.

374
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:53,970
Let's go.

375
00:36:03,222 --> 00:36:04,121
Who's there?

376
00:36:04,141 --> 00:36:05,239
Room service.

377
00:36:05,319 --> 00:36:06,398
In a minute.

378
00:36:12,912 --> 00:36:13,912
It's open.

379
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,290
What's the matter, miss? Is something wrong?

380
00:36:38,349 --> 00:36:41,486
There is. In the next cabin.

381
00:36:41,565 --> 00:36:43,543
I couldn't hear everything, but one came after me.

382
00:36:43,563 --> 00:36:44,682
Now come down a minute.

383
00:36:44,722 --> 00:36:46,960
I would be glad to help in any way miss.

384
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,238
You don't appreciate the danger we're in.

385
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:51,955
I'm sure I can help you. Are you a little bit sea sick?

386
00:36:55,133 --> 00:36:57,450
There are armed dangerous terrorists on the boat.

387
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:59,268
May I ask you how you know this?

388
00:36:59,288 --> 00:37:02,885
I could hear their voices.
They're getting ready to start right now.

389
00:37:02,966 --> 00:37:04,983
I better get you to the Captain.
He'll wanna hear about this.

390
00:37:06,901 --> 00:37:07,901
Watch your step.

391
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:13,215
I'm starving to death.

392
00:37:16,528 --> 00:37:18,267
Huh... Huh?

393
00:37:19,885 --> 00:37:23,185
D-Ahhh! It's a rat. Yaaaoo!

394
00:37:23,286 --> 00:37:25,563
Wow, my prays were answer to snack at last.

395
00:37:35,114 --> 00:37:36,433
Uh? Where's the Captain?

396
00:37:36,633 --> 00:37:37,912
Up in the nightclub.

397
00:37:38,111 --> 00:37:39,830
Why did you bring me here?

398
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:43,087
You mentioned that you thought
you overheard some terrorists.

399
00:37:43,107 --> 00:37:44,306
Yes, sir.

400
00:37:45,345 --> 00:37:46,743
I'm one of them.

401
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,379
You...

402
00:37:52,699 --> 00:37:55,296
We'll take all the rich men on board to Thailand.

403
00:37:55,331 --> 00:37:56,494
You... you scum.

404
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:58,792
Sorry, pretty girl.

405
00:38:03,048 --> 00:38:04,127
Sorry.

406
00:38:05,925 --> 00:38:08,243
What a blow. Who are ya?

407
00:38:08,483 --> 00:38:09,802
I am City Hunter.

408
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,619
Gimme your hands. Hold this.

409
00:38:15,276 --> 00:38:16,355
That was dinner.

410
00:38:16,515 --> 00:38:17,594
Wait.

411
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:24,468
Halt.

412
00:38:24,507 --> 00:38:26,545
Don't move. I'll shoot him, I swear.

413
00:38:26,665 --> 00:38:27,945
Kiyoko, go away.

414
00:38:28,104 --> 00:38:29,104
Good idea.

415
00:38:29,303 --> 00:38:30,303
Shoot them.

416
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:31,275
NO!

417
00:38:36,176 --> 00:38:37,975
Huh? Two bullets, cheap skates!

418
00:38:41,772 --> 00:38:44,649
Attention! Intercept the couple. The're clothed in white.

419
00:38:49,024 --> 00:38:50,024
Wait for me.

420
00:38:58,916 --> 00:38:59,894
Hurry.

421
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:15,121
Spread out.

422
00:39:31,065 --> 00:39:32,943
Quick, quick. Here.

423
00:39:47,265 --> 00:39:48,365
Wait!

424
00:39:50,666 --> 00:39:52,065
Drop it or I'll drop you.

425
00:40:07,651 --> 00:40:08,650
Great.

426
00:40:10,128 --> 00:40:11,627
Kiyoko, you ok?

427
00:40:11,247 --> 00:40:12,147
Uh? yeah.

428
00:40:15,283 --> 00:40:16,482
So princely.

429
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:20,938
Him I mean?

430
00:40:21,677 --> 00:40:22,876
Yeah, I knew that.

431
00:40:23,756 --> 00:40:26,133
The tall black man is really getting his clock cleaned.

432
00:40:26,153 --> 00:40:27,851
Easy. I could fight a couple of those.

433
00:40:33,146 --> 00:40:35,925
Hey, jump up quickly. What?

434
00:40:35,983 --> 00:40:38,797
Listen. You need a worm if you're going fishing. I won't do it.

435
00:40:53,107 --> 00:40:55,406
You wasted all the bullets you fool.

436
00:40:56,324 --> 00:40:58,043
Ah! My fists are hammers.

437
00:41:04,037 --> 00:41:05,435
You'd fight a couple, huh?

438
00:41:05,636 --> 00:41:06,914
Get hold of them!

439
00:41:07,794 --> 00:41:08,912
Run away!

440
00:41:12,709 --> 00:41:14,627
Kiyoko, how can we escape?

441
00:41:14,786 --> 00:41:15,666
Oh, you say that.

442
00:41:15,786 --> 00:41:16,824
How can we escape?

443
00:41:17,064 --> 00:41:19,063
I'm gonna take care of it. Watch this.

444
00:41:23,658 --> 00:41:24,977
Are you alright?

445
00:41:25,377 --> 00:41:27,774
He He! Hardly touch me. Don't worry.

446
00:41:29,293 --> 00:41:30,412
Oo Oo! It hurts.

447
00:41:47,236 --> 00:41:50,953
No fair at all. I'm just a little guy.

448
00:41:55,907 --> 00:41:57,586
Your feet are like boats.

449
00:42:13,252 --> 00:42:14,451
Hey, watch!

450
00:42:55,851 --> 00:42:57,130
Help me!

451
00:42:58,928 --> 00:43:00,847
Help me! Help me!

452
00:43:01,725 --> 00:43:02,924
Put her down and fight.

453
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:09,117
Watch it!

454
00:44:05,105 --> 00:44:06,464
Incredible, Hunter!

455
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,460
Were you hurt?

456
00:44:18,173 --> 00:44:19,452
How many terrorists are there?

457
00:44:19,891 --> 00:44:20,891
I don't know.

458
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:21,770
How many guns?

459
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:23,048
I don't know.

460
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:24,607
We need a hiding place.

461
00:44:24,687 --> 00:44:25,686
Where?

462
00:44:25,846 --> 00:44:26,845
Your room?

463
00:44:26,925 --> 00:44:28,004
I just escaped from there.

464
00:44:28,043 --> 00:44:30,561
Ah, they probably won't look for you there.

465
00:44:30,921 --> 00:44:32,239
Hey, you're real good!

466
00:44:32,279 --> 00:44:33,298
You too.

467
00:44:48,025 --> 00:44:49,024
Hold it!

468
00:44:49,503 --> 00:44:51,701
Don't move! Hands on your head!

469
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:54,379
We're taking over the boat.

470
00:44:56,417 --> 00:44:57,417
Like hell.

471
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:05,608
Welcome, ladies and gentleman.

472
00:45:05,848 --> 00:45:09,564
I'll now have Captain Williams un-cork
the cerimonial champaign,

473
00:45:09,605 --> 00:45:12,002
and wish you all a happy voyage. Hi!

474
00:45:16,717 --> 00:45:18,536
I wish City Hunter were around.

475
00:45:18,995 --> 00:45:20,194
I want you girl.

476
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:25,789
My bow tie?

477
00:45:26,428 --> 00:45:27,547
Looks fine.

478
00:45:59,497 --> 00:46:01,435
The terrorists, they're really here.

479
00:46:01,516 --> 00:46:02,595
Take it easy.

480
00:46:24,493 --> 00:46:25,972
Hey, you dropped the gun.

481
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,239
Hey, gorgeous we meet again.

482
00:46:43,395 --> 00:46:44,795
Oh, you finished off one.

483
00:46:49,929 --> 00:46:51,228
What are you doing?

484
00:46:51,268 --> 00:46:52,627
He may have some food.

485
00:46:53,146 --> 00:46:55,424
Tobacco. He doesn't care about his health.

486
00:46:55,464 --> 00:46:56,464
How about chocolate?

487
00:46:56,623 --> 00:46:58,102
Why? Not one snack.

488
00:46:58,462 --> 00:46:59,462
Want some gum?

489
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,179
I suppose so.

490
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:06,614
What's that?

491
00:47:07,813 --> 00:47:09,211
A micro-computer.

492
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:12,488
And it knows the data on every terrorist using his prints.

493
00:47:12,688 --> 00:47:14,586
It reads the fingerprints from
anything the man's touched.

494
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:17,803
Then a display appears on the screen. Huh, not bad.

495
00:47:17,963 --> 00:47:19,042
Bend down.

496
00:47:19,961 --> 00:47:21,399
Now let's just check you out.

497
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:23,879
Your bottoms has been touched at least once.

498
00:47:27,154 --> 00:47:30,271
Known as City Hunter a private detective.

499
00:47:30,351 --> 00:47:32,749
Distinguishing features: a handsome womanizer.

500
00:47:32,888 --> 00:47:37,265
Undefeatable in battle, honest,
intelligent and good to his mother.

501
00:47:37,084 --> 00:47:38,543
It's you?

502
00:47:38,723 --> 00:47:40,022
Whoopsie!

503
00:47:45,556 --> 00:47:48,874
They were right next door. There must be some fingerprints.

504
00:47:56,566 --> 00:48:00,443
Chow, Kim. International gun for hire wanted for murder

505
00:48:00,563 --> 00:48:03,160
An ex-member of at least two terrorist groups.

506
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:06,237
Huh, not bad. We'll see who else is around.

507
00:48:15,988 --> 00:48:16,967
Hi, there.

508
00:48:20,563 --> 00:48:21,463
Time to leave.

509
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:37,287
Ladies and gentleman, allow me to introduce myself.

510
00:48:37,328 --> 00:48:41,483
I'm known as Mac. Or call me Mc Donald.

511
00:48:41,804 --> 00:48:43,482
Now, my friends...

512
00:48:43,641 --> 00:48:46,959
Now, we're only after your money.

513
00:48:46,998 --> 00:48:49,596
If you cooperate, you won't force us to murder.

514
00:48:49,756 --> 00:48:52,753
Now, if you don't... We'll kill you.

515
00:48:55,390 --> 00:49:00,346
This is a list. When you hear your name,
please come forward.

516
00:49:00,506 --> 00:49:04,262
I'll shoot and kill anyone who disobeys.

517
00:49:04,561 --> 00:49:07,839
Ok. Here are the names.

518
00:49:08,738 --> 00:49:10,337
First, Mr. Robinson.

519
00:49:11,256 --> 00:49:13,133
- Don't.
- No.

520
00:49:13,334 --> 00:49:14,732
I must or die.

521
00:49:20,527 --> 00:49:21,726
Stay here.

522
00:49:24,643 --> 00:49:27,241
Are you crazy? Get him.

523
00:49:28,399 --> 00:49:29,399
Hey. What?

524
00:49:29,478 --> 00:49:32,076
Want a turn?

525
00:49:32,276 --> 00:49:34,274
We don't believe in violence.

526
00:49:34,593 --> 00:49:35,113
What are you doing?

527
00:49:35,312 --> 00:49:36,552
Playing videos together.

528
00:49:36,751 --> 00:49:38,350
You know there's terrorists around?

529
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:39,508
You're terrifying us.

530
00:49:39,789 --> 00:49:41,227
They'll kidnap or kill all of us.

531
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:42,946
What a bummer.

532
00:49:43,345 --> 00:49:44,544
The best way to the casino?

533
00:49:44,624 --> 00:49:46,143
Sure, the elevator.

534
00:49:47,701 --> 00:49:49,420
How would I get there silently?

535
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:51,857
I know. In the elevator, don't whistle.

536
00:49:52,216 --> 00:49:54,235
Ahh! That's all, I've had enough. I'm going.

537
00:49:54,294 --> 00:49:56,333
Both you are better notify the police.

538
00:49:56,892 --> 00:49:58,011
Oh right. Ba-bye.

539
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:00,689
Now what?

540
00:50:00,728 --> 00:50:01,728
Here, this way.

541
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:03,246
This way?

542
00:50:04,205 --> 00:50:08,202
Good. Excellent. Well, time for a little game now.

543
00:50:08,441 --> 00:50:11,638
First, I'd like you to empty your pockets
quickly and open every purse.

544
00:50:11,598 --> 00:50:15,994
I need cash, watches.
Give them all to the man in red as he goes past.

545
00:50:16,253 --> 00:50:19,651
Quick, Hurry, Come on. Let's go. Everyone.

546
00:50:21,469 --> 00:50:23,866
You. In the bag.

547
00:50:24,426 --> 00:50:27,503
After that, line up one after another.

548
00:50:27,623 --> 00:50:29,541
Since you like gambling

549
00:50:29,621 --> 00:50:32,339
I'll be the banker I'll be happy to play with you.

550
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,018
Will you be a winner?

551
00:50:34,137 --> 00:50:35,136
Let's go.

552
00:50:35,216 --> 00:50:37,933
Someone's loose. I think City Hunter might be on board.

553
00:50:39,293 --> 00:50:42,130
Take a man with you. I want him alive.

554
00:50:42,249 --> 00:50:43,208
Right.

555
00:50:46,465 --> 00:50:47,864
Oh! There you are.

556
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:50,562
Ooo! Hey, look at this? How do you like that?

557
00:50:50,821 --> 00:50:51,820
A bomb?

558
00:50:51,781 --> 00:50:54,777
Nah, a transmitter. It's the new 47-B.

559
00:50:55,557 --> 00:50:56,875
A transmitter? Alright.

560
00:50:57,155 --> 00:51:01,551
Yeah, you're probably wondering how I get the relay to go.

561
00:51:03,449 --> 00:51:05,667
After we get rescued, you wanna play pinball?

562
00:51:06,745 --> 00:51:08,864
- Hey, you're dialing 1234?
- Yeah.

563
00:51:09,003 --> 00:51:10,942
- It's a cipher.
- What does it mean?

564
00:51:10,882 --> 00:51:12,581
Look up. What's it say?

565
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,659
Help!

566
00:51:16,737 --> 00:51:17,936
Stay in line.

567
00:51:25,369 --> 00:51:27,846
You're first. Please, sit down.

568
00:51:32,961 --> 00:51:34,440
You like baccarat?

569
00:51:34,439 --> 00:51:35,359
Sure.

570
00:51:35,418 --> 00:51:37,916
Good, alright, Let's play.

571
00:51:45,369 --> 00:51:46,668
Ah Ha! Seven for me.

572
00:51:46,468 --> 00:51:48,746
Oooo! Seven, nice.

573
00:51:51,563 --> 00:51:53,441
Ahh! I have nine.

574
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:56,259
Goodbye.

575
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:04,332
Six.

576
00:52:04,452 --> 00:52:05,651
Six.

577
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:07,169
It's a tie, then.

578
00:52:07,248 --> 00:52:09,167
Sorry, all ties to the bank.

579
00:52:12,005 --> 00:52:13,203
Next.

580
00:52:13,283 --> 00:52:15,681
I won't, I won't. No one can win.

581
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:32,345
Be gentle. It'll be better in your room.

582
00:52:33,324 --> 00:52:35,163
Let's go. No, stop it.

583
00:52:36,541 --> 00:52:38,260
- No, wait.
- What's that?

584
00:52:39,578 --> 00:52:43,494
No. Man, you wanna last all night,
You need this little vile it keeps...

585
00:52:50,288 --> 00:52:53,665
I'll be next. Ok?

586
00:53:14,505 --> 00:53:15,823
Seven.

587
00:53:35,525 --> 00:53:39,002
Ok, deal us another one.

588
00:53:50,151 --> 00:53:51,151
That way.

589
00:53:55,467 --> 00:53:59,543
Excellent. You're very good. You've won 29 games.

590
00:54:36,427 --> 00:54:39,425
Hello, there. I bet you'd like to find City Hunter.

591
00:54:39,545 --> 00:54:40,983
I would, seen him?

592
00:54:41,223 --> 00:54:42,201
Yes, sir.

593
00:54:42,262 --> 00:54:45,060
Oh! tell me where he is and I'll spare you.

594
00:55:03,961 --> 00:55:05,480
- Oh, forget it.
- Hmm?

595
00:55:39,288 --> 00:55:40,766
Go with them over there. Ok?

596
00:56:01,227 --> 00:56:02,626
Hey, that was your fault.

597
00:56:04,024 --> 00:56:05,822
Hey, what about me?

598
00:56:05,903 --> 00:56:06,903
I'll come back.

599
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:20,968
Glad you made it.

600
00:56:21,009 --> 00:56:21,808
You do nice work.

601
00:56:21,968 --> 00:56:23,886
That one man grab Kaori He took her.

602
00:56:24,086 --> 00:56:25,124
Wow! I better rescue her.

603
00:56:25,164 --> 00:56:26,443
Good idea.

604
00:56:41,349 --> 00:56:42,908
Big muscle man, huh?

605
00:56:45,945 --> 00:56:48,722
Why should we hurry? We're having a party.

606
00:57:26,707 --> 00:57:30,582
You, you're so mighty. Fun, huh?

607
00:57:30,862 --> 00:57:32,980
So you like to play games, huh?

608
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:41,532
It's my turn, ok?

609
00:57:41,572 --> 00:57:42,651
Ok, come on.

610

Ah, not there.

611
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:55,359
Oh! Fantastic.

612
00:57:55,479 --> 00:57:57,158
I want more.

613
00:58:03,671 --> 00:58:04,870
Do you have a fall?

614
00:58:05,869 --> 00:58:07,267
You animal.

615
00:58:08,008 --> 00:58:09,066
I'm coming.

616
00:58:17,138 --> 00:58:18,258
Stop!

617
00:58:20,495 --> 00:58:21,495
What you want?

618
00:58:21,574 --> 00:58:22,574
What's going on?

619
00:58:22,653 --> 00:58:25,730
What do you think? Handsome and I are having a game.

620
00:58:26,967 --> 00:58:27,867
Huh?

621
00:58:28,168 --> 00:58:29,367
Who's that guy?

622
00:58:29,607 --> 00:58:31,005
I am Hunter.

623
00:58:31,325 --> 00:58:32,604
Oh! Wow!

624
00:58:35,561 --> 00:58:37,359
I hear that you can fight.

625
00:58:37,719 --> 00:58:41,675
Know what? He's also strong.

626
00:58:43,633 --> 00:58:45,332
Hit him now. Huh?

627
00:58:52,905 --> 00:58:55,303
How dare you, that's my girlfriend.

628
00:58:56,781 --> 00:58:58,339
What was I hearing?

629
00:59:03,854 --> 00:59:06,372
Girlfriend? Say that to me once.

630
00:59:09,848 --> 00:59:11,248
What am I?

631
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:15,483
You moron.

632
00:59:16,403 --> 00:59:18,800
Moron?

633
01:00:07,834 --> 01:00:08,913
I hit hard.

634
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:12,030
Where as you hit like a girl.

635
01:00:15,066 --> 01:00:16,186
Hold it.

636
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:23,300
Don't move.

637
01:00:23,379 --> 01:00:24,279
Ok.

638
01:00:28,334 --> 01:00:29,233
The gun.

639
01:00:29,274 --> 01:00:30,591
-No! no firearms.
- What's that?

640
01:00:30,632 --> 01:00:32,630
Are you afraid to use your fist chump?

641
01:00:36,686 --> 01:00:38,285
Get a hold of her. Now. Quick.

642
01:00:39,324 --> 01:00:42,361
So, nice to meet you. City Hunter.

643
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:43,719
Is it now.

644
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:46,717
Throw away the gun and we'll use our hands, Colonel.

645
01:00:46,836 --> 01:00:47,996
You know who I am?

646
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:51,452
A Commando you used to work within the U.S. government.

647
01:00:51,712 --> 01:00:54,130
Ah, but now a bandit. A big shot.

648
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:55,667
That's right.

649
01:00:55,806 --> 01:00:57,606
And I sentence you to death.

650
01:00:57,707 --> 01:00:58,705
Don't do it.

651
01:00:58,865 --> 01:01:02,462
No mercy. I'll shoot you. And quite soon.

652
01:01:03,261 --> 01:01:04,460
Why?

653
01:01:23,482 --> 01:01:24,641
Where is Hunter?

654
01:01:25,201 --> 01:01:26,000
Hm! Who's asking me?

655
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:28,437
Don't be like that. Have you any idea where?

656
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:29,876
He might be captured.

657
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:38,293
There isn't a choice. All of us must defeat them.

658
01:01:38,328 --> 01:01:41,185
Hey, we don't have a single gun.
Are we to use our fingers...

659
01:01:41,226 --> 01:01:42,226
I have a gun.

660
01:01:53,853 --> 01:01:56,371
I don't think we can get by him. Should we surprise him?

661
01:01:56,731 --> 01:01:58,729
Forget that. I need a gun.

662
01:02:00,607 --> 01:02:01,525
I'll distract him.

663
01:02:01,605 --> 01:02:03,689
Wow! Great idea. Good for you. Yeah!

664
01:02:03,724 --> 01:02:05,602
You want a little practice before you go?

665
01:02:07,321 --> 01:02:09,798
Cousin, go to the ladies aid right now.

666
01:02:09,998 --> 01:02:11,317
You bet, darling.

667
01:02:17,951 --> 01:02:23,005
Oh! I surrender, handsome. Be kind to me. Have mercy.

668
01:02:27,142 --> 01:02:28,940
Now that I'm captured,

669
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:31,577
I have to be anything you like.

670
01:02:51,239 --> 01:02:54,956
What's that? Yes, I'm on a cruise. Yes, that's right.

671
01:02:55,115 --> 01:02:56,115
Yes.

672
01:02:57,433 --> 01:02:59,931
No, wait. I'm willing to cooperate.

673
01:03:00,471 --> 01:03:02,089
Keep me company tonight.

674
01:03:03,227 --> 01:03:04,426
Pardon?

675
01:03:21,370 --> 01:03:23,448
Hey, you break down the door and us two go in.

676
01:03:24,607 --> 01:03:25,806
Is it hard to do?

677
01:03:26,166 --> 01:03:28,044
Hey! Really simple. Go.

678
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:42,110
Go.

679
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:53,460
Duck!

680
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:05,689
Don't move.

681
01:04:10,324 --> 01:04:11,324
Come on.

682
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:16,239
Get away.

683
01:04:21,873 --> 01:04:24,950
White crane, crab, Dragon Claw.

684
01:04:32,023 --> 01:04:33,302
Is this a private party?

685
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:36,380
Change and meet back here.

686
01:04:36,419 --> 01:04:37,419
Alright.

687
01:04:37,538 --> 01:04:38,617
Alright.

688
01:04:40,056 --> 01:04:41,255
This way. Yep!

689
01:04:47,329 --> 01:04:48,728
You will need weapons.

690
01:04:53,363 --> 01:04:54,762
Hey, girl. Want a weapon?

691
01:04:55,801 --> 01:04:57,279
No, I don't think so.

692
01:04:58,478 --> 01:04:59,677
Yes.

693
01:05:00,996 --> 01:05:02,195
Oh, wait.

694
01:05:02,595 --> 01:05:03,793
Go away.

695
01:05:04,793 --> 01:05:06,951
There you go, teddy bear.

696
01:05:09,148 --> 01:05:10,547
Are you both children?

697
01:05:10,667 --> 01:05:12,425
You wanna put me over your knee?

698
01:05:14,983 --> 01:05:16,601
Will you save the hostages or City Hunter?

699
01:05:16,681 --> 01:05:18,660
Um? Hunter preferably. Hm-hm! Hmm!

700
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:20,538
We will save the hostages. Yeah!

701
01:05:20,858 --> 01:05:22,456
I'll help you two. OK!

702
01:05:30,648 --> 01:05:34,465
Well, my friend. Today's your last day to see the sun.

703
01:05:34,804 --> 01:05:36,922
I'd like to get one last wish.

704
01:05:37,002 --> 01:05:37,801
Yes?

705
01:05:37,761 --> 01:05:40,159
Go pick me up a sandwich, I need to eat.

706
01:05:40,958 --> 01:05:43,556
Fear has driven City Hunter completely insane.

707
01:05:45,674 --> 01:05:47,352
Sorry, no way.

708
01:05:47,472 --> 01:05:49,790
Fine for you. I'm starving to death.

709
01:05:52,108 --> 01:05:53,946
Dogs, get ready.

710
01:05:57,902 --> 01:05:58,701
Hold it.

711
01:05:58,742 --> 01:06:00,939
Huhhh! Why did you do this?

712
01:06:01,059 --> 01:06:04,755
Well, well, well, well, a princess. What do you want?

713
01:06:04,816 --> 01:06:06,314
I beg you let him go.

714
01:06:06,694 --> 01:06:08,512
I'm rich, I'll make you both wealthy.

715
01:06:08,732 --> 01:06:11,709
My father is the owner of the japanese
newspaper and he's got plenty.

716
01:06:11,744 --> 01:06:13,827
I'll have him give you a lot of cash.

717
01:06:14,526 --> 01:06:16,125
Why should I believe you?

718
01:06:16,284 --> 01:06:18,083
Listen, I can prove it.

719
01:06:18,243 --> 01:06:22,220
Call 052789

720
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:25,336
Take it down. Check it out.

721
01:06:26,355 --> 01:06:28,273
This man means that much to you?

722
01:06:28,753 --> 01:06:31,150
He's the best man that I've ever met.

723
01:06:33,828 --> 01:06:37,025
Good. I'll call your dad with the news,

724
01:06:37,065 --> 01:06:39,124
after we shoot your City Hunter.

725
01:06:39,159 --> 01:06:41,021
Oh! You scumbag.

726
01:06:41,781 --> 01:06:43,379
- Nobody move.

727
01:06:43,819 --> 01:06:46,616
- Drop your weapons.
- Hurry.

728
01:06:55,727 --> 01:06:57,505
- Get them!
- Got it! Let's go.

729
01:07:05,838 --> 01:07:07,616
- Grab it!
- No, my hands are tied.

730
01:07:07,956 --> 01:07:10,054
- You're ok?
- Come on.

731
01:07:16,587 --> 01:07:17,387
Where's the gun?

732
01:07:17,427 --> 01:07:18,586
Take it.

733
01:07:22,222 --> 01:07:23,221
Shoot the gun.

734
01:07:30,015 --> 01:07:31,094
I'm heavy Huh?

735
01:07:31,813 --> 01:07:33,392
I'm being crushed.

736
01:07:35,490 --> 01:07:36,369
No.

737
01:07:38,167 --> 01:07:39,166
Gimme that.

738
01:07:41,484 --> 01:07:42,484
Go up and hide.

739
01:07:42,883 --> 01:07:43,682
Where do I go?

740
01:07:43,802 --> 01:07:44,721
Hurry.

741
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,878
- Where?
- Go on.

742
01:07:49,996 --> 01:07:50,996
Jump.

743
01:07:56,470 --> 01:07:58,588
Hey! You forgot about untieing me.

744
01:10:18,455 --> 01:10:20,134
You really hit bottom.

745
01:10:23,890 --> 01:10:25,569
- What the hell was that?
- Run!

746
01:10:29,365 --> 01:10:30,644
Thunder Strikers.

747
01:10:54,622 --> 01:10:55,622
Spread out in circle.

748
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:57,818
Two on the left of the rail, the rest follow me.

749
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:39,539
Anybody here?

750
01:11:41,577 --> 01:11:42,577
Oh, that's great.

751
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:50,888
What are you two playing at?

752
01:11:52,407 --> 01:11:53,606
Quickly, untie this.

753
01:12:00,639 --> 01:12:01,639
Quickly, untie it.

754
01:14:08,917 --> 01:14:09,876
You win.

755
01:14:14,113 --> 01:14:15,192
Who's next?

756
01:15:10,899 --> 01:15:11,817
You ok?

757
01:15:11,978 --> 01:15:13,576
What exactly happened to me?

758
01:15:14,056 --> 01:15:15,056
You had a fight.

759
01:15:15,135 --> 01:15:16,533
Wow, you cleaned this clock.

760
01:15:16,972 --> 01:15:18,071
He's still alive though.

761
01:15:18,072 --> 01:15:19,490
Yeah, that's a pity.

762
01:15:19,529 --> 01:15:23,167
Wait! Go back up on the deck.
The Thunder Strikers have gotten here.

763
01:15:23,207 --> 01:15:23,806
- Ok.
- Alright.

764
01:15:23,846 --> 01:15:25,005
- Wait.
- Where's Kaori?

765
01:15:25,405 --> 01:15:26,724
Kaori? At the casino.

766
01:15:26,764 --> 01:15:28,562
The casino? I'll head there.

767
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:32,479
Like he said. Well? alright.

768
01:15:35,012 --> 01:15:37,412
- Hurry up!
- Quiet quiet.

769
01:15:37,913 --> 01:15:38,913
Quick.

770
01:15:42,628 --> 01:15:44,307
There's some over there. Hurry.

771
01:15:44,426 --> 01:15:45,505
Run.

772
01:15:46,984 --> 01:15:48,263
Get away. Run.

773
01:16:25,428 --> 01:16:26,907
One left. I'll try my luck.

774
01:16:37,377 --> 01:16:40,075
Lucks run out. No cards left to play.

775
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:46,549
Lo Che... Wait!

776
01:17:18,858 --> 01:17:20,935
Hey!

777
01:17:22,254 --> 01:17:24,651
- You ok?
- I'm ok.

778
01:17:25,291 --> 01:17:27,049
Thanks to your ace of hearts.

779
01:17:27,130 --> 01:17:28,728
You'd better go to the upper deck.

780
01:17:28,848 --> 01:17:30,207
Reinforcements are aboard.

781
01:17:31,405 --> 01:17:32,045
Coming?

782
01:17:32,324 --> 01:17:34,323
No, to the casino to help them fight.

783
01:17:34,523 --> 01:17:35,801
You'll be alright?

784
01:17:37,719 --> 01:17:40,317
Oh, yeah. You and I should go out on a date someday.

785
01:17:39,893 --> 01:17:42,193
Hmm! Yeah.

786
01:17:43,394 --> 01:17:45,293
Move out. Right. Post guards everywhere.

787
01:19:07,435 --> 01:19:07,954
Kaori...

788
01:19:07,994 --> 01:19:08,953
Hey! Watch out!

789
01:19:10,511 --> 01:19:11,511
Jump!

790
01:19:15,786 --> 01:19:16,985
No bullets again?

791
01:19:17,585 --> 01:19:18,783
I'm loaded.

792
01:19:37,886 --> 01:19:39,005
Behind us!

793
01:20:01,664 --> 01:20:02,782
How's that?

794
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:06,099
City Hunter.

795
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:07,916
You finally got here.

796
01:20:08,657 --> 01:20:09,556
- Don't move.
- You halt!

797
01:20:10,254 --> 01:20:11,454
Hey, put her down.

798
01:20:11,493 --> 01:20:12,873
What? Oh! She's a weapon, really.

799
01:20:12,972 --> 01:20:14,851
Oh! That's why you're carrying her? Huh?

800
01:20:16,029 --> 01:20:18,727
MacDonald, there's no way that you can escape.

801
01:20:18,927 --> 01:20:19,927
Soldiers are here.

802
01:20:19,966 --> 01:20:22,883
With you as hostages I can go by lifeboat.

803
01:20:30,156 --> 01:20:31,435
Let's make a deal.

804
01:20:31,595 --> 01:20:34,512
You let me go and I will let her go.

805
01:20:34,712 --> 01:20:35,591
Don't let him go.

806
01:20:35,711 --> 01:20:37,031
He's beaten my cousin all to hell.

807
01:20:37,390 --> 01:20:38,390
How bad?

808
01:20:38,489 --> 01:20:41,306
Real bad. I feel awful.

809
01:20:42,944 --> 01:20:45,142
Huh? It's pathetic.

810
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:48,220
Versal.

811
01:21:06,002 --> 01:21:07,201
Thank you for being the fool.

812
01:21:07,601 --> 01:21:08,601
You're very welcome.

813
01:21:10,119 --> 01:21:11,757
Say goodnight, you moron.

814
01:21:21,868 --> 01:21:25,544
The end, All done, No more, Finito, Phase complete.

815
01:21:26,423 --> 01:21:28,941
Please don't kill me. I have seven children.

816
01:21:29,020 --> 01:21:31,219
You've earn two centuries inside a jail.

817
01:21:31,818 --> 01:21:32,737
I was wrong.

818
01:21:33,217 --> 01:21:34,255
Yeah, that's true.

819
01:21:34,456 --> 01:21:35,214
Your ears.

820
01:21:35,255 --> 01:21:37,413
- I got them.
- And you swear you won't be back?

821
01:21:37,772 --> 01:21:39,451
I will never do it again.

822
01:21:39,650 --> 01:21:40,650
Can I go?

823
01:21:40,769 --> 01:21:41,769
Say "May I?".

824
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:37,259
Hunter, grab this.

825
01:23:43,013 --> 01:23:44,013
That hurt.

826
01:23:55,202 --> 01:23:56,601
Weapon.

827
01:23:56,761 --> 01:23:57,840
Here.

828
01:24:12,106 --> 01:24:14,384
Up, middle, low, right.

829
01:24:24,614 --> 01:24:27,052
You couldn't even hit the side of a barn.

830
01:24:35,164 --> 01:24:36,643
Not even close.

831
01:24:54,346 --> 01:24:55,265
You bastard.

832
01:24:55,465 --> 01:24:56,504
I'm something, aren't I?

833
01:26:24,241 --> 01:26:25,541
Yeah?

834
01:27:06,501 --> 01:27:07,899
Goodbye...

835
01:27:30,838 --> 01:27:32,037
Hunter.

836
01:27:34,674 --> 01:27:36,633
Are you alright? Wounded?

837
01:27:36,672 --> 01:27:37,832
I'm just bruised.

838
01:27:38,431 --> 01:27:39,431
May I lift you?

839
01:27:40,748 --> 01:27:43,067
I'm mad, Huh? Furious!

840
01:27:43,266 --> 01:27:44,265
Huh? What?

841
01:27:45,344 --> 01:27:47,382
- Were you hurt?
- Very badly.

842
01:27:47,422 --> 01:27:49,620
- You seem ok.
- You were hold that coward.

843
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:50,700
Let me pick you up.

844
01:27:51,818 --> 01:27:52,818
All better?

845
01:27:53,017 --> 01:27:54,616
It's over now. Kaori, we're all set.

846
01:27:54,895 --> 01:27:56,654
Oh. Where'd Kiyoko go, Hunter?

847
01:27:57,812 --> 01:27:58,812
Where's she gone?

848
01:27:59,571 --> 01:28:00,889
Be right back.

849
01:28:01,218 --> 01:28:02,318
Why me?

850
01:28:11,619 --> 01:28:12,619
Wait a sec'.

851
01:28:12,618 --> 01:28:13,798
Remarkable.

852
01:28:14,856 --> 01:28:17,433
Kiyoko, please don't go away.

853
01:28:17,713 --> 01:28:21,270
No, I won't. I won't leave ever again.

854
01:28:21,869 --> 01:28:24,248
And I'll do anything you like.

855
01:28:25,067 --> 01:28:25,986
Anything?

856
01:28:26,985 --> 01:28:29,462
I want a bowl of noodles.

857
01:28:30,062 --> 01:28:32,460
City Hunter, are you ok?

858
01:28:46,926 --> 01:28:50,083
Indeed. Again, you have our gratitude.

859
01:28:51,161 --> 01:28:52,121
My pleasure.

860
01:28:52,361 --> 01:28:53,320
Sit down.

861
01:28:56,636 --> 01:28:57,756
City Hunter,

862
01:28:58,235 --> 01:29:01,472
I would like to speak with no one else present.

863
01:29:02,031 --> 01:29:03,510
Don't be long.

864
01:29:07,066 --> 01:29:08,586
I guess I'll leave.

865
01:29:08,985 --> 01:29:09,624
Thank you.

866
01:29:09,784 --> 01:29:11,063
Let's wander out.

867
01:29:19,095 --> 01:29:22,292
Hold my calls. I want no interruptions.

868
01:29:24,910 --> 01:29:26,488
Sir, I'm impressed.

869
01:29:26,688 --> 01:29:28,286
My daughter has returned to me.

870
01:29:28,526 --> 01:29:30,684
And she is changed for the better, thanks to you.

871
01:29:30,844 --> 01:29:31,923
Don't mention it.

872
01:29:32,123 --> 01:29:33,801
You know you really should date her.

873
01:29:33,841 --> 01:29:36,679
I think you'd make a very fine husband. You could tame her.

874
01:29:39,196 --> 01:29:40,935
You'd make an excellent son in law,

875
01:29:40,975 --> 01:29:46,509
and naturally when I retire my daughter
and her family will inherit everything.

876
01:29:46,669 --> 01:29:49,147
If I am choosing who marries my daughter then

877
01:29:49,227 --> 01:29:51,424
of course you'd be a wealthy man.

878
01:29:52,264 --> 01:29:54,222
Well, can I assume you're in love?

879
01:30:07,889 --> 01:30:09,089
No.

880
01:30:09,128 --> 01:30:09,851
Why not?

881
01:30:09,886 --> 01:30:11,606
Ah! Well, I can't do that.

882
01:30:11,886 --> 01:30:13,584
I don't want one. I want'em all.

883
01:30:13,683 --> 01:30:15,322
No, it would'nt work for me.

884
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:19,439
I figured you wanna know your friends going.

885
01:30:20,277 --> 01:30:21,376
It's no big deal.

886
01:30:22,276 --> 01:30:24,433
Thank you, sir. Thanks a lot.

887
01:30:25,472 --> 01:30:28,849
Hey, watch out now. Think quickly. I charge interest.

888
01:30:34,584 --> 01:30:35,503
Where'd that girl go?

889
01:30:35,583 --> 01:30:37,261
- Outside.
- Outside?

890
01:30:37,701 --> 01:30:38,940
Nice perfume.

891
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:40,458
How sweet.

892
01:31:03,077 --> 01:31:05,115
Kaori, where are you going?

893
01:31:05,654 --> 01:31:07,233
It's for you.

894
01:31:09,431 --> 01:31:12,148
Kaori, what's wrong with you?

895
01:31:12,268 --> 01:31:13,266
You rat.

896
01:31:13,906 --> 01:31:16,984
Oh yeah! Kaori will be what? Your maid?

897
01:31:18,022 --> 01:31:19,581
I don't think you understand.

898
01:31:19,541 --> 01:31:22,099
You heard and you think I said yes. I didn't.

899
01:31:22,139 --> 01:31:24,456
Alright? Of course not.

900
01:31:24,593 --> 01:31:26,193
I'm through with other women.

901
01:31:26,494 --> 01:31:27,693
City Hunter.

902
01:31:32,409 --> 01:31:34,508
My, my, hello.

903
01:31:34,607 --> 01:31:35,806
Hi.

904
01:31:36,805 --> 01:31:38,004
You look bored.

905
01:31:38,004 --> 01:31:39,163
You bet.

906
01:31:40,121 --> 01:31:42,400
Hey! You want to go along for a ride?

907
01:31:42,559 --> 01:31:43,758
Alright.

908
01:31:43,638 --> 01:31:45,357
Wow. What is that?

909
01:31:45,877 --> 01:31:46,436
You want it?

910
01:31:46,556 --> 01:31:47,475
Thanks.

911
01:31:47,635 --> 01:31:49,073
City Hunter.

912
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:05,178
I was born lucky.
