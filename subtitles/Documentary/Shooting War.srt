1
00:00:03,136 --> 00:00:05,331
Other wars
have been photographed.

2
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:09,774
World War II was covered
from start to finish,

3
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,676
in every service,
in every theater.

4
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:18,343
<i>For the first time in history,</i>
<i>civilians knew something</i>

5
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:21,410
<i>of how their sons,</i>
<i>husbands and brothers</i>

6
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:26,926
<i>lived and died</i>
<i>in this vast crucible.</i>

7
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:30,690
<i>The images of this war</i>
<i>burned our eyes and spirits</i>

8
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:32,823
<i>and welded us together.</i>

9
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,768
I loved it because
it was dangerous.

10
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,107
I'm a fraidy-cat,

11
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,944
but if there was
a job to do, I did it.

12
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,075
No matter how horrible
the action was

13
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:26,778
that you were covering,

14
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:28,821
when you looked
through that glass,

15
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:30,856
that glass was your filter.

16
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,154
I got carried away one time

17
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:35,353
and got out in front of the gun,

18
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,659
shooting the gun firing,
and that was a big mistake,

19
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:42,394
because the muzzle blast got me
and knocked me about 40 feet,

20
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:43,959
ass over tea kettle.

21
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:47,302
We hit an intersection
where we were shot at.

22
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:51,036
The bullets just whizzed by us
into the cab of the truck.

23
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,079
When you're bailing
out of that airplane,

24
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:56,547
and you're on the way down,
you say, "Oh, no. Oh, no."

25
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,847
But shells...
You can't see anything.

26
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:03,821
You want to yell, "Stop.
This is... I'm here."

27
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,825
Those are some of the men
who took the pictures

28
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:10,124
by which
we remember World War II.

29
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:12,630
Some of their images
are immortal.

30
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:15,930
Many have been hidden
in the archives for decades.

31
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:18,937
But whether their pictures
are famous or not,

32
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:21,838
what you are about to see
is unique.

33
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:24,638
War stories backed
by the irrefutable evidence

34
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:27,179
of the films they made.

35
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,908
In their hands,

36
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:32,884
the camera became a weapon
more potent than the rifle,

37
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:36,513
a weapon whose impact resonates
even more powerfully now

38
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:40,150
as memory
is transformed into history.

39
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:45,429
<i>[Tom Hanks] In 1941, we were</i>
<i>as unprepared to photograph war</i>

40
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,432
<i>as we were to wage it.</i>

41
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,730
<i>When John Ford made his film</i>
<i>on Pearl Harbor,</i>

42
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:52,498
<i>the Japanese attack</i>
<i>was recreated out of special effects,</i>

43
00:02:52,571 --> 00:02:55,972
<i>intercut with old</i>
<i>newsreel footage...</i>

44
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:58,203
<i>and a few feet</i>
<i>of the real thing.</i>

45
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:06,780
Men, man your battle stations.
God bless you.

46
00:03:06,852 --> 00:03:07,841
[Bugle blowing]

47
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,889
<i>[Hanks] The great Hollywood</i>
<i>cameraman Gregg Toland</i>

48
00:03:10,956 --> 00:03:13,891
<i>restaged these scenes</i>
<i>months after Pearl Harbor.</i>

49
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:17,588
<i>The actors</i>
<i>are obviously amateurs,</i>

50
00:03:17,663 --> 00:03:19,722
<i>but they are real sailors.</i>

51
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,892
<i>The attacking planes</i>
<i>were the contribution</i>

52
00:03:21,967 --> 00:03:25,494
<i>of the 20th Century-Fox</i>
<i>special effects department.</i>

53
00:03:35,414 --> 00:03:36,745
<i>In this outtake,</i>

54
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:39,876
<i>you can see the wires</i>
<i>supporting the model Zero.</i>

55
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:45,819
<i>Ford organized</i>
<i>his field photographic branch</i>

56
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:48,860
<i>before the war,</i>
<i>as part of the O.S.S.</i>

57
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,832
<i>Toland's crew set fire</i>
<i>to crashed planes,</i>

58
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,164
<i>adding drama to his footage.</i>

59
00:03:57,236 --> 00:03:59,864
<i>But his first cut,</i>
<i>a feature-length fictional parable</i>

60
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,998
<i>about American unpreparedness</i>

61
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:04,338
<i>was judged unreleasable.</i>

62
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:08,806
<i>Ford now took</i>
<i>a more active hand,</i>

63
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:12,408
<i>cutting</i> December 7th
<i>to 34 minutes.</i>

64
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:16,251
<i>He retained much of the miniature</i>
<i>footage, also made at Fox.</i>

65
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:18,290
<i>This material,</i>
<i>never before seen,</i>

66
00:04:18,357 --> 00:04:19,790
<i>was shot in color,</i>

67
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:22,657
<i>though the film was released</i>
<i>in black and white.</i>

68
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:26,658
<i>This is Hollywood's version</i>

69
00:04:26,732 --> 00:04:28,757
<i>of Pearl Harbor's</i>
<i>battleship row,</i>

70
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:31,860
<i>and the Ford-Toland version</i>
<i>of the attack on it.</i>

71
00:04:34,306 --> 00:04:38,037
<i>There was authentic footage</i>
<i>of the battleship</i> Nevada <i>trying to escape,</i>

72
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,045
<i>but Ford preferred this reconstruction.</i>

73
00:04:41,113 --> 00:04:44,082
<i>It matched the rest</i>
<i>of his fake footage better.</i>

74
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:48,078
<i>Besides, his goal</i>
<i>was not strict authenticity.</i>

75
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,122
<i>He was out to stir the nation.</i>

76
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:52,089
<i>There was enough reality</i>
<i>in his film</i>

77
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:55,525
<i>to win an Academy Award</i>
<i>for Best Short Subject.</i>

78
00:04:55,594 --> 00:04:59,189
<i>As Toland and Ford worked on</i>
<i>their film in spring 1942,</i>

79
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:03,224
<i>America mounted its first</i>
<i>aggressive response to Pearl Harbor,</i>

80
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:06,863
<i>a navy task force</i>
<i>under Admiral Bull Halsey.</i>

81
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,998
<i>It carried</i>
<i>James Doolittle's fliers</i>

82
00:05:09,074 --> 00:05:12,771
<i>and 16 B-25s aboard the</i> Hornet.

83
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:16,110
<i>Hal Kempe was a photographer's mate</i>
<i>on the newly commissioned ship.</i>

84
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,207
<i>[Kempe]</i>
<i>I've heard many stories.</i>

85
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:22,220
<i>Some of them say that we slipped out</i>
<i>under the cover of darkness.</i>

86
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:24,950
<i>We went under</i>
<i>the Golden Gate Bridge at noon,</i>

87
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,958
<i>and we had the planes lined up</i>

88
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:29,085
<i>from one end of the flight deck</i>
<i>to the other,</i>

89
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:31,891
<i>and it looked like</i>
<i>a ferry trip.</i>

90
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:35,400
<i>After we were at sea</i>
<i>for about two or three days,</i>

91
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:38,027
they re-spotted the flight deck.

92
00:05:38,103 --> 00:05:41,300
They took each B-25...
they are tricycle landing gear...

93
00:05:41,373 --> 00:05:43,307
and placed them
with their tails

94
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,605
extending out over
the flight deck at the edge.

95
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,408
<i>They put one on each</i>
<i>port and starboard side</i>

96
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,816
<i>until the lead plane had</i>
<i>sufficient run for his takeoff.</i>

97
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:56,719
<i>[Hanks] That was one-third</i>
<i>the normal takeoff distance.</i>

98
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:03,853
<i>The raiders were spotted</i>
<i>by Japanese picketboats.</i>

99
00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:06,454
<i>They were sunk, but might</i>
<i>have radioed a warning.</i>

100
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:09,365
<i>There was no choice but to launch</i>
<i>the attack prematurely.</i>

101
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:13,166
<i>[Kempe] They said, "Army pilots,</i>
<i>man your planes. We're going to launch. "</i>

102
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:17,005
<i>So we were launching</i>
<i>eight hours too soon.</i>

103
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:22,241
<i>Doolittle was first.</i>

104
00:06:22,314 --> 00:06:25,806
<i>Boom, he went, and the rest</i>
<i>of the crews are wondering,</i>

105
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,876
<i>"Can it be done?"</i>

106
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:34,057
<i>[Hanks] The raiders,</i>
<i>all volunteers,</i>

107
00:06:34,126 --> 00:06:36,094
<i>had practiced</i>
<i>short-run takeoffs on land.</i>

108
00:06:36,161 --> 00:06:39,562
<i>A few had practiced from a carrier deck,</i>
<i>but never in bad weather.</i>

109
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:41,600
<i>Yet all were safely launched</i>

110
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:44,158
<i>for their 30 seconds</i>
<i>over Tokyo.</i>

111
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,262
<i>Halsey's concern?</i>

112
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:50,137
<i>The early launch made it</i>
<i>impossible for the planes</i>

113
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,143
<i>to make safe landings in China,</i>

114
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:54,907
<i>yet all but three fliers</i>
<i>survived the raid.</i>

115
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,313
<i>It did little damage,</i>
<i>except to enemy morale.</i>

116
00:07:00,252 --> 00:07:03,551
<i>[Kempe] They carried</i>
<i>four 500-pound bombs each,</i>

117
00:07:03,622 --> 00:07:07,058
<i>and that's not very much</i>
<i>when you really look at it,</i>

118
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:08,559
but it was enough

119
00:07:08,627 --> 00:07:12,085
to put the fear of God
into them for a while.

120
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:14,765
<i>[Hanks] The Doolittle raid</i>

121
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:19,463
<i>provoked a huge Japanese counterattack</i>
<i>aimed at destroying the U.S. Pacific fleet,</i>

122
00:07:19,538 --> 00:07:21,506
<i>but we had broken their code</i>

123
00:07:21,573 --> 00:07:24,565
<i>and knew they would be</i>
<i>attacking Midway Island.</i>

124
00:07:24,643 --> 00:07:26,611
<i>This evened the odds</i>
<i>for the</i> Hornet

125
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,203
<i>and two other carriers</i>

126
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,511
<i>as they approached the war's</i>
<i>first great naval battle.</i>

127
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,946
<i>Midway was a pair</i>
<i>of tiny coral atolls</i>

128
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,215
<i>vital to the defense of Hawaii.</i>

129
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:41,020
<i>This time, John Ford</i>
<i>was present with a film crew.</i>

130
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:44,256
<i>Ford himself</i>
<i>operated one of the cameras</i>

131
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,264
<i>and was wounded</i>
<i>getting these pictures.</i>

132
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,266
<i>He would win another Oscar</i>

133
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,768
<i>for the film</i>
<i>he fashioned from them.</i>

134
00:07:50,836 --> 00:07:53,066
<i>The crucial part of the battle</i>
<i>was at sea,</i>

135
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:55,003
<i>between ships</i>
<i>that never saw one another.</i>

136
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:58,737
<i>[Kempe] They didn't know exactly</i>
<i>where the Japanese fleet was,</i>

137
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,780
<i>but our torpedo squadron</i>
<i>skipper had an idea</i>

138
00:08:01,847 --> 00:08:03,838
<i>that it was off</i>
<i>in a certain direction,</i>

139
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,781
<i>and he went off there.</i>

140
00:08:05,851 --> 00:08:08,581
<i>He ran into</i>
<i>the whole bunch of them.</i>

141
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,916
<i>And they lost...</i>

142
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,253
<i>Fifteen or sixteen</i>
<i>torpedo planes went down.</i>

143
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:15,259
<i>[Hanks] These are the men</i>
<i>of Torpedo Squadron 8,</i>

144
00:08:15,327 --> 00:08:17,295
<i>who found</i>
<i>the Japanese carriers.</i>

145
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:20,355
<i>They scored no hits, but along</i>
<i>with other torpedo planes,</i>

146
00:08:20,432 --> 00:08:22,297
<i>they distracted enemy gunners,</i>

147
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:25,303
<i>allowing our dive-bombers</i>
<i>to sink four carriers.</i>

148
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:28,067
<i>Only one man, George Gay,</i>
<i>on the right, survived.</i>

149
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:33,034
<i>One of Ford's crew</i>
<i>shot these pictures.</i>

150
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:35,842
<i>The director made them</i>
<i>into a short memorial film,</i>

151
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:39,350
<i>which he sent</i>
<i>to the squadron's next of kin.</i>

152
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:44,048
<i>Midway shifted the balance</i>
<i>of naval power in the Pacific.</i>

153
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:47,149
<i>It cost the Japanese</i>
<i>almost half their carriers.</i>

154
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:49,160
<i>Still, their wounded navy</i>

155
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,662
<i>continued to pose</i>
<i>a deadly threat.</i>

156
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:54,858
<i>October 1942.</i>

157
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:57,333
<i>The</i> Hornet <i>steams toward</i>
<i>the Battle of Santa Cruz</i>

158
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:58,870
<i>near Guadalcanal.</i>

159
00:08:58,937 --> 00:09:01,667
<i>With her sister ship,</i>
<i>the</i> Enterprise,

160
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,176
<i>she was soon fighting off</i>
<i>massive assaults from the air.</i>

161
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:07,303
<i>Just how close</i>
<i>the combat often was</i>

162
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:09,313
<i>is demonstrated</i>
<i>by this sequence,</i>

163
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:11,576
<i>shot from the</i> Enterprise.

164
00:09:26,932 --> 00:09:29,423
<i>A near miss</i>
<i>shakes the</i> Enterprise.

165
00:09:32,571 --> 00:09:33,970
<i>An enemy shadow</i>

166
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:37,304
<i>is cast on the flight deck</i>
<i>as the ship fights on.</i>

167
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,510
<i>The camera catches</i>
<i>the wild swing of the huge ship</i>

168
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:45,573
<i>as it takes evasive action.</i>

169
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,782
<i>But still the bombs rain down.</i>

170
00:09:58,997 --> 00:10:02,865
<i>The camera survived this hit,</i>
<i>but not the cameraman.</i>

171
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,665
<i>The</i> Hornet
<i>did not survive either.</i>

172
00:10:05,737 --> 00:10:07,967
<i>[Kempe] We were listing</i>
<i>to the starboard.</i>

173
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,031
<i>Real heavy list.</i>

174
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,545
<i>I went to the fantail</i>
<i>to help with the wounded,</i>

175
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:17,070
<i>where I stayed the rest of the</i>
<i>day until we abandoned ship.</i>

176
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:21,142
And I swam out on the quarter,
about 45 degrees out this way,

177
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,179
and got out so far,
and here come the destroyers.

178
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:28,158
<i>I figured, "This is going</i>
<i>to be a piece of cake.</i>

179
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,320
<i>Pick us up quick. "</i>

180
00:10:30,395 --> 00:10:32,022
<i>Then they backed down</i>
<i>and took off.</i>

181
00:10:32,097 --> 00:10:35,328
<i>The destroyers start circling</i>
<i>way out around the ship</i>

182
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,369
<i>and start firing, and I figured,</i>
<i>"What are they firing at?"</i>

183
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:41,804
<i>We started looking in the sky,</i>
<i>and coming in on this line...</i>

184
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:43,808
<i>we had gone out</i>
<i>on the fantail...</i>

185
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:46,936
<i>was a "V" formation of</i>
<i>twin-engine bombers coming in,</i>

186
00:10:47,012 --> 00:10:50,470
<i>and you could see the five-inch</i>
<i>antiaircraft bursts up there by it.</i>

187
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,642
And they came and... shoop!

188
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:56,381
Went right over the head, and
one hit the fantail back here,

189
00:10:56,455 --> 00:11:00,516
and the rest was in a pattern
around the stern of the ship.

190
00:11:00,592 --> 00:11:02,992
<i>And they continued on</i>
<i>and never came back.</i>

191
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:05,029
<i>I got picked up</i>
<i>right after that</i>

192
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:07,998
<i>by the 411</i> Anderson.

193
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:12,696
<i>[Hanks] That final bombing run</i>
<i>was the coup de grâce.</i>

194
00:11:12,771 --> 00:11:16,070
<i>The next day, the</i> Hornet's
<i>short, brave life was ended</i>

195
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:18,075
<i>when American destroyers</i>
<i>sank her.</i>

196
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:21,909
Our ship had been in commission
for one year and six days.

197
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,642
<i>[Hanks] But the carrier war</i>
<i>in the Pacific never ceased.</i>

198
00:11:24,716 --> 00:11:27,583
<i>[Kempe] We didn't have</i>
<i>motors on the Mitchells,</i>

199
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,587
<i>but you had to hand-crank.</i>

200
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:31,748
So when we did
flight deck operations,

201
00:11:31,823 --> 00:11:35,054
we did not hand-crank
at three turns per second

202
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:36,992
on the small crank.

203
00:11:37,062 --> 00:11:38,927
We used the big crank,

204
00:11:38,997 --> 00:11:41,795
and we would start
going up to high speed,

205
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,461
because we'd want
slow motion of the crash.

206
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:46,629
<i>The pilot coming in</i>
<i>for landing...</i>

207
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:49,037
<i>If you see the photographer</i>
<i>on the flight deck</i>

208
00:11:49,107 --> 00:11:53,100
<i>start with that big crank,</i>
<i>look out, you bought the farm.</i>

209
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:30,807
<i>[Hanks] The footage Kempe and his</i>
<i>colleagues took on the flight decks</i>

210
00:12:30,882 --> 00:12:33,146
<i>forms an eerie ballet</i>
<i>of destruction</i>

211
00:12:33,218 --> 00:12:35,686
<i>and of unlikely survival.</i>

212
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:40,322
<i>By late 1942,</i>

213
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:43,521
<i>we were officially</i>
<i>training combat cameramen.</i>

214
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,861
<i>Standard army issue was the</i>
<i>35-millimeter Eyemo for movies</i>

215
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:50,096
<i>and the 4x5 Speed Graphic</i>
<i>for stills.</i>

216
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:54,265
<i>Many of the cameramen had been</i>
<i>photographers in civilian life.</i>

217
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,672
<i>Hal Roach's Culver City studio</i>

218
00:12:56,742 --> 00:13:00,269
<i>was a major production</i>
<i>and training center.</i>

219
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:03,213
<i>Naturally, the students</i>
<i>took pictures of themselves</i>

220
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,647
<i>taking pictures.</i>

221
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:08,847
<i>Eventually about 1,500 men,</i>
<i>not a lot for a war this huge,</i>

222
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,446
<i>would become motion-picture</i>
<i>combat cameramen.</i>

223
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,992
<i>Many served in the air force.</i>

224
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,790
<i>On the endless strategic</i>
<i>bombing raids over Europe,</i>

225
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:18,797
<i>they worked as bomb spotters,</i>

226
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:21,265
<i>recording damage</i>
<i>for intelligence analysts.</i>

227
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,701
<i>The oil fields</i>
<i>at Ploesti in Rumania</i>

228
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:27,705
<i>were vital</i>
<i>to the German war effort</i>

229
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:30,401
<i>and among the most</i>
<i>bombed targets of the war.</i>

230
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,137
<i>On August 1, 1943,</i>

231
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,941
<i>these B-24s based in Libya</i>

232
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:37,005
<i>mounted the first</i>
<i>major attack on them</i>

233
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,778
<i>at a daring 500 feet.</i>

234
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:42,651
<i>Then, as later,</i>
<i>results were poor.</i>

235
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:45,316
<i>Ploesti was never knocked out.</i>

236
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:49,054
<i>Doug Morrell flew later</i>
<i>higher-altitude missions over Ploesti.</i>

237
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,528
<i>[Morrell] This mission</i>
<i>could be 10 hours long,</i>

238
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,724
<i>but the combat part</i>
<i>is only about 10 minutes.</i>

239
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:56,768
Ten minutes is a long time.
Try holding your breath.

240
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:00,294
<i>The Eyemo had</i>
<i>a hand-crank wind on it,</i>

241
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:03,467
<i>and it seemed like always when the most</i>
<i>important thing happened,</i>

242
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:06,944
<i>you're winding that thing,</i>
<i>trying to get it going.</i>

243
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,277
<i>I hated to reload</i>
<i>up at 20,000 feet.</i>

244
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:12,374
<i>Reloading up there,</i>
<i>your fingers get a little cold.</i>

245
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:15,487
<i>When you come into the target,</i>

246
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:17,546
<i>they put up so much flak</i>

247
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:20,091
<i>that the enemy fighters</i>
<i>won't come in there.</i>

248
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,626
<i>They'll get hit.</i>

249
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,162
<i>Bomb spotting</i>
<i>is when the bombs release.</i>

250
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,529
<i>Then you follow them</i>
<i>and pick up their hits.</i>

251
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,899
<i>When you get those hits down there,</i>
<i>the intelligence can use those.</i>

252
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:37,271
<i>We were bombing Ploesti,</i>
<i>and flak hit us.</i>

253
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,573
<i>We had to drop</i>
<i>out of formation.</i>

254
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:45,015
<i>And then six ME-109s jumped us</i>
<i>when we got out of formation.</i>

255
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,416
<i>We were quite a ways away,</i>
<i>all by ourselves.</i>

256
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:50,478
<i>They raked us back and forth</i>
<i>and set us on fire.</i>

257
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,490
I opened the bomb bay door.

258
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,925
I was going to jump out there
instead of out the back end.

259
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,088
Here's this fire coming.
I says, "Oh."

260
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:01,531
I grabbed a little
fire extinguisher, about that long.

261
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:04,570
<i>I'm starting to pump that.</i>
<i>I says, "I better leave."</i>

262
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,434
<i>I went out the back end.</i>

263
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,996
<i>Just as I left</i>
<i>out of there, it blew.</i>

264
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,475
<i>We averaged about five</i>
<i>out of an airplane.</i>

265
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:14,206
<i>When I bailed out,</i>
<i>I was the last one out,</i>

266
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,942
<i>and then the other five</i>
<i>got killed in there.</i>

267
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,278
<i>[Hanks] Another cameraman</i>

268
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:21,616
<i>who survived the often catastrophic</i>
<i>air war was Dan McGovern.</i>

269
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,154
You were so busy,

270
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,281
you weren't thinking
about a battle.

271
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:28,088
You were thinking about
helping others and shooting.

272
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,422
In the meantime,

273
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:32,931
<i>you couldn't</i>
<i>become a spectator.</i>

274
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:34,466
<i>You had to shoot.</i>

275
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,501
<i>If you're flying in a bomber,</i>

276
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:38,730
<i>there's 10 crew members</i>
<i>in a bomber.</i>

277
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:40,738
<i>You're the 11th man.</i>

278
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:43,900
<i>So then we had to</i>
<i>prove ourselves.</i>

279
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,411
<i>As a matter of fact...</i>

280
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:49,004
<i>This is a true story,</i>
<i>so help me God.</i>

281
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,983
<i>I photographed</i>
<i>my own crash landing.</i>

282
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:56,215
<i>The two engines</i>
<i>on the right side, out.</i>

283
00:15:56,289 --> 00:16:00,157
<i>The third engine on the</i>
<i>left side, out. One engine.</i>

284
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:03,161
So I cut to the right,
cut to the left,

285
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:05,663
look over the top,

286
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:09,098
<i>and the airplane's coming in</i>
<i>for a crash landing.</i>

287
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:17,234
<i>You don't think about it.</i>

288
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,904
<i>You're so excited,</i>
<i>you're not scared,</i>

289
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,005
<i>but you're scared</i>
<i>after when you come back.</i>

290
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:25,209
- You're just shaking.
- <i>[Hanks] We dropped</i>

291
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,252
<i>over two million tons</i>
<i>of bombs on Europe,</i>

292
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,721
<i>but never matched the results</i>
<i>promised by air power advocates.</i>

293
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,850
<i>This war, like all wars,</i>
<i>would be won on the ground,</i>

294
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:35,450
<i>as Norman Hatch learned</i>

295
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:38,463
<i>when he made</i>
<i>the Tarawa landing in 1943.</i>

296
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:41,591
<i>[Hatch] I was with Jim Crow,</i>
<i>who was a battalion commander.</i>

297
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,999
He wasn't happy with having me there

298
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,129
because, as he had told me earlier,

299
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,765
he didn't want
any Hollywood marines with him.

300
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,607
I testified to him that I was
a regular marine, I shot expert.

301
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,772
If I needed a rifle,
I could do something with it.

302
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:59,682
<i>He said, "Come with me,</i>
<i>but don't get in my way. "</i>

303
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:02,744
<i>I was sitting alongside of him,</i>
<i>shooting what was going on,</i>

304
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:05,290
<i>and he observed</i>
<i>that his amtracs,</i>

305
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,292
<i>which were</i>
<i>the first three waves,</i>

306
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,885
<i>were not maintaining</i>
<i>their course.</i>

307
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:12,328
<i>And because</i>
<i>there was a.50-caliber</i>

308
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,923
<i>buried in the sand</i>
<i>that was shooting at them,</i>

309
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,093
<i>they kept edging</i>
<i>over to the right,</i>

310
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,637
<i>and Crow could see</i>
<i>his front disappearing</i>

311
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,639
<i>because of this maneuver.</i>

312
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,972
<i>So he told the coxswain</i>
<i>to put the boat in now.</i>

313
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,842
<i>We ran up on the reef.</i>
<i>The ramp wouldn't go down.</i>

314
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:30,404
<i>All of us had to go</i>
<i>over the side,</i>

315
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:34,112
<i>which is difficult to do</i>
<i>with 80 pounds of gear on your shoulder.</i>

316
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,820
<i>We got to the beach,</i>
<i>and we were exhausted</i>

317
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,790
<i>because you can't walk</i>
<i>through water</i>

318
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:42,589
<i>without having</i>
<i>a lot of resistance,</i>

319
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,959
<i>and loaded down with gear</i>
<i>and everything else,</i>

320
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,463
<i>it drained you completely.</i>

321
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:49,695
<i>It took us a couple of minutes</i>
<i>on the beach to get oriented.</i>

322
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:55,099
<i>[Hanks] Hatch was pinned down</i>
<i>with the rest of the invaders.</i>

323
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,301
<i>There was nothing</i>
<i>to do but shoot.</i>

324
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,971
<i>Combat footage with</i>
<i>a previously unknown ferocity.</i>

325
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:07,146
<i>[Hatch] The emplacements that were</i>
<i>there by the Japanese were fantastic.</i>

326
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:09,949
<i>They built a concrete bunker</i>
<i>and covered it with sand.</i>

327
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,990
<i>Then they covered it with logs.</i>

328
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:14,048
<i>Then they covered that</i>
<i>with sand.</i>

329
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,219
<i>They were pretty impregnable.</i>

330
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:20,159
<i>[Hanks] The Pacific war</i>
<i>favored the cameramen.</i>

331
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:21,824
<i>Spaces were confined,</i>

332
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:24,563
<i>the action within them</i>
<i>tightly focused.</i>

333
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:27,003
<i>The brutal reality of war</i>
<i>revealed itself here</i>

334
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,063
<i>as it rarely did elsewhere.</i>

335
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:38,406
<i>Hatch caught the marines</i>
<i>and their enemy in combat</i>

336
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:39,746
<i>in the same shot.</i>

337
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:41,081
<i>[Hatch] That was luck.</i>

338
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:44,589
<i>I was on top of this enclosure,</i>
<i>and somebody said, "Here they come."</i>

339
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:47,922
<i>I turned, and there it was,</i>
<i>and I just kept on shooting.</i>

340
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:52,259
<i>[Hanks] Had the Japanese mounted a</i>
<i>coordinated counterattack on that first day,</i>

341
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:55,323
<i>they might have driven</i>
<i>the marines back into the sea.</i>

342
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:12,181
<i>But the fighting remained</i>
<i>as Hatch's film showed it:</i>

343
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:15,550
<i>Ferocious yet disorganized.</i>

344
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:18,249
<i>Most of the Japanese</i>
<i>fought to the death.</i>

345
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:21,555
<i>The marines</i>
<i>took only 17 prisoners.</i>

346
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:24,653
<i>The seas continued</i>
<i>to run against reinforcements.</i>

347
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:28,188
<i>Among them was</i>
<i>another cameraman, John Ercole.</i>

348
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,758
<i>[Ercole] We didn't even</i>
<i>know what was going on.</i>

349
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,303
<i>We were going nowhere.</i>

350
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:35,772
<i>The propeller and the tide</i>
<i>didn't come together.</i>

351
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,771
<i>I was shooting</i>
<i>whatever I could at the time,</i>

352
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,473
<i>faces of people in my own boat</i>
<i>and things like that.</i>

353
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,778
Nineteen hours later,

354
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,375
we finally made a landing.

355
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,582
<i>[Hanks]</i>
<i>What Ercole found to shoot</i>

356
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,523
<i>was mostly the dead</i>
<i>and wounded.</i>

357
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:57,323
<i>At first their evacuation</i>
<i>was poorly handled.</i>

358
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:01,662
<i>Hatch credits a movie actor</i>
<i>with getting things organized.</i>

359
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,668
<i>[Hatch]</i>
<i>Eddie Albert was there.</i>

360
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:05,761
<i>He was a navy JG</i>
<i>at the time,</i>

361
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:07,897
<i>and he was a boat director.</i>

362
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:10,373
<i>And he discovered</i>
<i>early on in the game</i>

363
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:13,673
<i>that there wasn't too much coordination</i>
<i>on getting wounded out,</i>

364
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,839
<i>so he got on the beach himself,</i>

365
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:18,941
<i>and he stayed there during</i>
<i>the worst part of the fighting</i>

366
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:21,384
<i>and directed the navy boats</i>
<i>bringing supplies in</i>

367
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:24,513
<i>to carry wounded</i>
<i>back out to the ships.</i>

368
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,683
<i>[Hanks]</i>
<i>As the battle moved inland,</i>

369
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:31,287
<i>the futility of the preinvasion</i>
<i>naval bombardment was obvious.</i>

370
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,695
<i>[Hatch] Their pounding</i>
<i>didn't do too much good.</i>

371
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:35,927
<i>They were using</i>
<i>armor-piercing shells,</i>

372
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,969
<i>and there wasn't</i>
<i>any armor to pierce.</i>

373
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:39,971
<i>They were hitting sand</i>
<i>and bouncing off</i>

374
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:42,530
<i>and skittering</i>
<i>all over the island.</i>

375
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:45,202
<i>You'd see 16-inch shells</i>
<i>laying all over the place.</i>

376
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,438
<i>Nothing had ever happened</i>
<i>with them.</i>

377
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:53,283
<i>[Ercole] What grabbed me</i>
<i>and took hold of me</i>

378
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:56,412
<i>was the bodies,</i>
<i>the dead bodies,</i>

379
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:58,581
<i>God knows how many marines,</i>

380
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:01,387
<i>face down,</i>
<i>floating in shallow water.</i>

381
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:06,295
<i>That was the first time that I</i>
<i>had really seen dead bodies.</i>

382
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:09,129
When you see bodies
floating in the water,

383
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,634
it really grabs you.

384
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:14,036
<i>And they all seemed to look</i>
<i>like a buddy of mine,</i>

385
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,097
<i>Norman Hatch.</i>

386
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:18,336
<i>[Hatch] This was</i>
<i>a piece of ground</i>

387
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,538
<i>that wasn't as big</i>
<i>as Central Park in New York,</i>

388
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,014
<i>and in the course</i>
<i>of that 72 hours,</i>

389
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,950
<i>six thousand people died.</i>

390
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,112
<i>Five thousand</i>
<i>of those were Japanese.</i>

391
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:31,122
<i>One thousand were marines.</i>

392
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,181
<i>Then there were</i>
<i>another 2,000 wounded.</i>

393
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:39,487
<i>[Hanks] Passing a disabled tank,</i>
<i>Hatch heard this kitten's cry.</i>

394
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:42,056
<i>At first he thought</i>
<i>it might be a wounded enemy,</i>

395
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,103
<i>but it was just</i>
<i>another war victim.</i>

396
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,400
<i>He thought he might</i>
<i>make a pet of it,</i>

397
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:50,033
<i>but after getting his drink,</i>
<i>the kitten scampered away,</i>

398
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:51,599
<i>never to be seen again.</i>

399
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:57,804
<i>The quality of his Tarawa film</i>
<i>earned Hatch a trip home,</i>

400
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,646
<i>where this footage of him</i>

401
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:02,152
<i>was made for</i>
<i>an Army-Navy short subject.</i>

402
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,715
<i>[Hatch] We drove</i>
<i>down Market Street,</i>

403
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:09,625
<i>and every major theater</i>
<i>had my name on the marquee</i>

404
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:11,663
<i>as taking the Tarawa film,</i>

405
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,755
<i>and they were running it.</i>

406
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,858
That's the best frame
of combat film I've ever seen.

407
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:17,924
That's okay.

408
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,733
When an army man says that
to a marine, he means it.

409
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:22,000
It was just luck.

410
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:26,043
<i>[Hanks]</i>
<i>A movie cameraman,</i>

411
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:29,103
<i>a stills man,</i>
<i>and a driver.</i>

412
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,012
<i>That's how the Signal Corps</i>

413

<i>organized its combat</i>
<i>photographers in Europe.</i>

414
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,845
<i>[Doug Wood]</i>
<i>The cameras we were using</i>

415
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:39,049
<i>were Eyemo,</i>
<i>called a "bomb spotter" camera.</i>

416
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:41,149
<i>It had a big crank on the side.</i>

417
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:45,390
<i>You wound it up, and they</i>
<i>only had one 2-inch lens.</i>

418
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:48,831
<i>And if you can believe</i>
<i>the running you have to do</i>

419
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:51,529
<i>to get your long shot,</i>
<i>medium shot and close-up</i>

420
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:53,537
<i>with a two-inch lens,</i>

421
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:57,905
<i>it was really criminal that they sent us</i>
<i>with that kind of stuff.</i>

422
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:04,416
<i>[Hanks] Yet remarkable things</i>
<i>could be done with that equipment.</i>

<i>John Huston, one of several</i>
<i>Hollywood directors</i>

<i>who followed John Ford to war,</i>

425
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:11,285
<i>used it to make</i>
<i>what critic James Agee thought</i>

<i>the best of all</i>
<i>war documentaries.</i>

427

<i>Huston would write and speak</i>

<i>Note interesting treatment</i>
<i>of chancel.</i>

432
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:32,340
<i>[Hanks] Huston, however,</i>
<i>would find real war</i>

433
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,005
<i>more difficult to direct</i>

436
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:44,449
<i>San Pietro was the scene of</i>
<i>some of the bitterest fighting</i>

437
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,855
<i>on our 5th Army front.</i>

438
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,393
<i>The Italian campaign</i>
<i>had entered its second phase:</i>

439
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:52,430
<i>To push forward again</i>
<i>after a static period</i>

440
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:54,489
<i>brought on</i>
<i>by heavy seasonal rain.</i>

441
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:59,837
<i>[Man] Huston came over,</i>
<i>and he had a mission.</i>

442
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:02,533
<i>[Hanks] That was to make</i>
<i>a coherent narrative</i>

443
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:06,408
<i>of one small battle that would</i>
<i>represent the entire war.</i>

444
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:09,879
<i>[Man] He realized</i>
<i>that you have no control.</i>

445
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,677
<i>You shoot what you can get.</i>

446
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,810
<i>You come up, you can fire</i>
<i>three rounds and drop.</i>

447
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:19,654
<i>But you can't get 10 feet</i>
<i>of film in the same way.</i>

448
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:23,855
<i>But if you had control,</i>
<i>you can do a lot with an Eyemo.</i>

449
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:26,057
<i>So he came back.</i>

450
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,599
<i>They gave him two battalions</i>

451
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:32,330
<i>out of the 36th Division who were on</i>
<i>rest and said, "Here it is,"</i>

452
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:34,770
<i>and he went ahead</i>
<i>and staged that whole thing.</i>

453
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,742
He used film that we had shot.

454
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:42,269
Actual battle film. And he
intercut it with what he had.

455
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:45,612
<i>His stuff was much better than ours.</i>

456
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:48,312
<i>[Hanks] Ed Montagne has</i>
<i>a veteran's genial tolerance</i>

457
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:49,786
<i>of Huston's tricks.</i>

458
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:52,824
<i>He used the most</i>
<i>picturesque munitions.</i>

459
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,621
<i>He slammed the camera with his</i>
<i>hand to simulate explosions.</i>

460
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:58,663
<i>He even posed American Gls</i>
<i>as dead Germans.</i>

461
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:03,463
<i>[Montagne] But he scared the poor 36th.</i>
<i>That was a nervous outfit.</i>

462
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,469
<i>He'd have them going up a hill,</i>

463
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:08,028
<i>and he'd throw</i>
<i>a grenade down the hill</i>

464
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:11,371
<i>and yell, "Grenade!"</i>
<i>And, Christ, they'd dive.</i>

465
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:13,536
<i>Some of the stuff</i>
<i>he got was great.</i>

466
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:17,139
<i>I admire him for what he did,</i>
<i>but I resented the fact</i>

467
00:25:17,216 --> 00:25:19,980
<i>that I would get critiques</i>
<i>from New York,</i>

468
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:24,284
<i>"Huston's men are able to</i>
<i>do this. Why can't yours?"</i>

469
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,756
I had the same people.

470
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:28,884
Didn't speak well of me,
did it?

471
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:34,029
<i>[Hanks] Some of Huston's</i>
<i>most moving footage</i>

472
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,363
<i>was of people</i>
<i>picking up the pieces,</i>

473
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:37,902
<i>of life reasserting itself</i>

474
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,404
<i>in the little town</i>
<i>of San Pietro.</i>

475
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:49,774
<i>[Huston Narrating] And the people pray</i>
<i>to their patron saint to intercede with God</i>

476
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:52,408
<i>on behalf of those</i>
<i>who came deliberately</i>

477
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:55,214
<i>and passed on to the north</i>

478
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:57,050
<i>with the passing battle.</i>

479
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:58,953
<i>[Choir vocalizing]</i>

480
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:05,129
<i>[Hanks] By 1944, the combat</i>
<i>photographers were everywhere,</i>

481
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:08,030
<i>even the China-Burma-India</i>
<i>theater.</i>

482
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,002
<i>To most Americans, that was</i>
<i>the war's most obscure corner.</i>

483
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:15,302
<i>Hidden behind high mountains</i>
<i>and deep jungles,</i>

484
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:18,810
<i>it was both a political</i>
<i>and logistical nightmare.</i>

485
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:22,278
<i>One air supply route was</i>
<i>called "The Aluminum Trail,"</i>

486
00:26:22,348 --> 00:26:24,748
<i>after all the planes</i>
<i>downed flying it.</i>

487
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:27,081
<i>When Generals Joseph Stilwell</i>
<i>and Frank Merrill</i>

488
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:30,815
<i>met to plan a mission against</i>
<i>the key Japanese airfield at Myitkyina,</i>

489
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:34,916
<i>photographer Dave Quaid</i>
<i>was there.</i>

490
00:26:34,994 --> 00:26:38,157
<i>[Quaid] When General Stilwell</i>
<i>flew off in his little plane,</i>

491
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,061
<i>I went up to Merrill</i>

492
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:42,396
and I said, "Hey, General,

493
00:26:42,468 --> 00:26:44,993
you mind if I join you guys?"

494
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,799
He said, "Come on along."

495
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:48,931
<i>[Hanks] Technically,</i>
<i>Quaid was AWOL</i>

496
00:26:49,008 --> 00:26:50,942
<i>when he joined</i>
<i>Operation Galahad.</i>

497
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:55,174
<i>He had no idea</i>
<i>what he was getting into.</i>

498
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:59,240
<i>[Quaid] Now we're on this trail</i>
<i>that is basically impassable,</i>

499
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:02,981
<i>and we had to cut steps</i>
<i>so even the mules...</i>

500
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:06,183
<i>The mules that can do anything,</i>
<i>handle any terrain,</i>

501
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:08,249
<i>could not handle this trail.</i>

502
00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:10,955
<i>We ourselves</i>
<i>carried so much equipment...</i>

503
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:14,431
<i>five days' K ration</i>
<i>and ammunition</i>

504
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,263
<i>and rifles and, ah...</i>

505
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:20,931
<i>And I carried a 13-pound camera</i>
<i>and 2,400 foot of film.</i>

506
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:26,570
<i>It got so rugged</i>

507
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:30,206
<i>that the mules</i>
<i>could not make it,</i>

508
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:32,375
<i>and finally what they had to do</i>

509
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:36,285
<i>was take the loads</i>
<i>and the saddles off the mules.</i>

510
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,959
<i>They would get a GI,</i>

511
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:45,554
<i>and a bunch of guys would lift</i>
<i>this 96-pound saddle</i>

512
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:47,656
<i>and put it on his back,</i>

513
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:51,191
<i>and then he would</i>
<i>have to climb the steps.</i>

514
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:54,262
<i>And then when we got</i>
<i>to a more level area,</i>

515
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,467
<i>we would load up</i>
<i>the mules again.</i>

516
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,435
<i>[Hanks]</i>
<i>Quaid tired of repeating</i>

517
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,502
<i>the same front and back angles.</i>

518
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:05,482
<i>He found a precarious perch in</i>
<i>a tree to get this side shot.</i>

519
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:07,485
<i>[Quaid]</i>
<i>The drop is 300 feet.</i>

520
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:09,316
<i>So I was young then,</i>

521
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:12,721
<i>and I jumped down</i>
<i>and I made the shot.</i>

522
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:15,385
<i>[Hanks] On the way to Myitkyina,</i>
<i>Merrill's Marauders</i>

523
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:17,361
<i>twice encountered Japanese patrols.</i>

524
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:30,199
<i>Here you can see an enemy bullet</i>
<i>cutting through the brush.</i>

525
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:40,447
<i>During the skirmish,</i>
<i>Quaid stepped into the open</i>

526
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:42,453
<i>to get this shot</i>
<i>of a fallen foe</i>

527
00:28:42,521 --> 00:28:44,489
<i>and the American</i>
<i>who killed him.</i>

528
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,150
<i>Probably the dumbest shot</i>
<i>I've ever made in my life,</i>

529
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:48,488
<i>because the Japanese</i>

530
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,824
were so stunned,
they didn't fire.

531
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:53,057
<i>They didn't believe their eyes.</i>

532
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:55,498
<i>[Hanks] This wilderness trek</i>
<i>took six days.</i>

533
00:28:57,436 --> 00:29:01,065
<i>[Quaid] The method of handling</i>
<i>malaria was very simple.</i>

534
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,472
<i>Simplest thing in the world.</i>

535
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:06,477
<i>It's called</i>
<i>"walking it out of you."</i>

536
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:10,037
<i>All our walking wounded from</i>
<i>the two battles we had fought</i>

537
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:13,448
<i>while coming over the mountains</i>
<i>were still with us.</i>

538
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:19,716
<i>[Hanks] The weary Marauders</i>
<i>still took the airfield by surprise,</i>

539
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:23,125
<i>but the Japanese continued</i>
<i>to hold the nearby town.</i>

540
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:28,726
<i>[Quaid] I became fascinated</i>
<i>with the 88th Fighter Squadron.</i>

541
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:32,032
<i>They had death's-heads</i>
<i>on their P-40F airplanes.</i>

542
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,868
<i>They were only about</i>
<i>a mile and a half</i>

543
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,464
<i>from the Japanese bunkers.</i>

544
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:38,703
<i>So they could make</i>
<i>one climbing turn</i>

545
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,075
<i>and come down</i>
<i>right on a bunker.</i>

546
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:43,205
<i>They were great for support</i>

547
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:46,376
<i>for the American and Chinese</i>
<i>surrounding Myitkyina.</i>

548
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,420
<i>I was always interested</i>

549
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:53,151
<i>in unique ways</i>
<i>of looking at things.</i>

550
00:29:54,593 --> 00:29:58,222
<i>I thought it would be great</i>
<i>if I could put my movie camera</i>

551
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:01,164
<i>into the P-40</i>
<i>on a dive-bombing run.</i>

552
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:08,267
<i>I see them up there,</i>
<i>and I see them make their turn,</i>

553
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,739
<i>and down they go,</i>

554
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:13,608
<i>and I see him right on the back</i>
<i>of the captain going down.</i>

555
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,546
<i>And the captain pulls out</i>
<i>after he releases his bomb,</i>

556
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:20,244
<i>and this guy is still</i>
<i>following the bomb down.</i>

557
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,913
<i>And there's this</i>
<i>terrific blast,</i>

558
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:25,786
<i>and I see him trying</i>
<i>to fly through the blast.</i>

559
00:30:25,858 --> 00:30:28,759
<i>He can't get any altitude,</i>
<i>but he comes in</i>

560
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,022
<i>and crash-lands</i>
<i>at the end of the strip.</i>

<i>[Hanks]</i>
<i>When the flight leader landed,</i>

<i>Quaid thought a strategic</i>
<i>retreat was in order.</i>

<i>He was, after all, responsible</i>
<i>for wrecking the plane.</i>

"Quaid, get out of here!"

566

"And if somebody's

<i>it was released</i>
<i>in black and white.</i>

624
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,958
<i>The last Japanese strongholds</i>

<i>honeycombed with caves</i>

626

<i>[Ercole]</i>
<i>The big thing on Saipan</i>

<i>was knocking these guys out</i>
<i>up on the rocks.</i>

629

<i>We had people speaking Japanese</i>
<i>trying to get them to give up,</i>

630
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:36,297
<i>and they were</i>
<i>just shooting back.</i>

631
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:39,834
<i>In the Marine Corps,</i>
<i>we took an oath</i>

632
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,505
that you were willing to die
to save your buddy

633
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:45,345
and you're willing to get
shot up to save your buddies.

634
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,817
<i>And the Japanese</i>
<i>took it a little further.</i>

635
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:51,913
<i>Their oath was to die</i>
<i>rather than give up.</i>

636
00:34:57,863 --> 00:35:00,798
<i>They were told we had</i>
<i>to kill our own children</i>

637
00:35:00,866 --> 00:35:04,233
<i>to get in the Marine Corps,</i>
<i>or consume our parents as food</i>

638
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:07,396
<i>and all kinds of stories that</i>
<i>these people had been told.</i>

639
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:10,669
<i>[Hanks] As always, only a handful</i>
<i>of Japanese soldiers surrendered.</i>

640
00:35:10,742 --> 00:35:13,768
<i>Mostly it was civilians</i>
<i>who gave up.</i>

641
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:17,747
<i>But even some of them</i>
<i>were too terrified to do so.</i>

642
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:21,081
<i>[Ercole] There's a shot on Saipan</i>
<i>where I come across a woman.</i>

643
00:35:21,153 --> 00:35:22,916
<i>There's a cut in the cliff,</i>

644
00:35:22,988 --> 00:35:25,149
<i>and she's maybe</i>
<i>60 yards away from me.</i>

645
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:27,191
She's got a child
standing here,

646
00:35:27,259 --> 00:35:31,127
baby in her hand,
and she spots me.

647
00:35:31,196 --> 00:35:34,597
She sees the camera,
which is on a gun stock.

648
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:37,464
<i>She doesn't know it's a camera,</i>
<i>so as I raise it up,</i>

649
00:35:37,536 --> 00:35:40,505
<i>she kicks this kid</i>
<i>off the cliff,</i>

650
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:44,235
<i>throws the baby off the cliff,</i>
<i>and she takes a dive.</i>

651
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,842
Now, that's all on film.

652
00:35:47,913 --> 00:35:51,610
It only may be... four seconds?

653
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:55,119
<i>That's the fear that these</i>
<i>people were embedded with.</i>

<i>[Hanks] This shot</i>
<i>of the dead child,</i>

<i>of the war,</i>

<i>was not released at the time.</i>

657

<i>These paratroopers</i>
<i>would be the first</i>

658

<i>to breach Hitler's</i>
<i>Atlantic wall.</i>

659
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:13,130
<i>They would land in Normandy</i>

660
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:16,173
<i>in the predawn darkness</i>
<i>of June 6, 1944,</i>

<i>greatest amphibious landing.</i>

<i>The bombers were next.</i>

663
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:28,941
<i>Every D day plane carried</i>
<i>broad identifying stripes.</i>

664
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,113
<i>This defense</i>
<i>against friendly fire</i>

665

<i>[Voelker]</i>
<i>On D day, we flew twice.</i>

668
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:42,457
<i>We went out early in the morning.</i>
<i>It was too dark to do much.</i>

669
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:45,002
<i>I was photographing the bombs</i>
<i>going down on the beach.</i>

670
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:48,267
<i>They brought sandwiches</i>
<i>and coffee out to the runway.</i>

671
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,932
<i>We stayed with the plane.</i>

672
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:52,306
<i>It was rebombed, refueled,</i>
<i>and we went back out.</i>

673
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:57,178
We went across the channel
and we saw the boats and ships

674
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:59,773
<i>from Tortie,</i>
<i>which was southern England,</i>

675
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:03,480
<i>all the way across,</i>
<i>and it was quite a sight</i>

676
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:07,889
<i>to see so much equipment</i>
<i>being moved across the channel.</i>

677
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,950
<i>They were bumper-to-bumper.</i>

678
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:17,563
<i>[Hanks] The troops</i>
<i>passed the hours</i>

679
00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:20,104
<i>in the usual pastimes</i>
<i>of anxious waiting.</i>

680
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:23,231
<i>But inescapably, they were</i>
<i>alone with their thoughts.</i>

681
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:27,043
<i>And with the equipment</i>
<i>on which,</i>

682
00:37:27,112 --> 00:37:29,546
<i>luck aside, and who</i>
<i>dared think about that,</i>

683
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:31,138
<i>their lives would depend.</i>

684
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:34,619
<i>In that whole vast armada,</i>

685
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:37,177
<i>only one creature</i>
<i>didn't know what awaited him.</i>

686
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:40,383
<i>But even he was prepared</i>
<i>for the worst.</i>

687
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:44,554
<i>Still, the choppy channel</i>
<i>and the fear took their toll.</i>

688
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:51,033
<i>As the day brightened,</i>
<i>the gliders appeared,</i>

689
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,662
<i>carrying more troops</i>
<i>to assault the Germans</i>

690
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:56,138
<i>from behind their lines.</i>

691
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:59,199
<i>Then the bombers,</i>
<i>flying low, returned.</i>

692
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:03,279
<i>[Voelker] But the second time,</i>
<i>we went over low.</i>

693
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:06,283
Maybe 5,000 feet.
It was exceptional for us.

694
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:08,979
<i>We never bombed down that low.</i>

695
00:38:09,054 --> 00:38:12,649
<i>[Hanks] Voelker's bomb spotting</i>
<i>was also exceptional,</i>

696
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:14,783
<i>steady and unerring.</i>

697
00:38:18,163 --> 00:38:20,927
<i>[Voelker] In most of the</i>
<i>documentaries of World War II,</i>

698
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:24,400
<i>you'll see a chicken foot</i>
<i>impression on the screen.</i>

699
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:27,131
<i>That day I got static</i>
<i>electricity in the camera.</i>

700
00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:29,002
<i>The sparks appear in the gate,</i>

701

<i>and it's on every foot of film</i>
<i>goes through the camera.</i>

702
00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:34,307
<i>That was my D day.</i>

703
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:38,783
<i>[Hanks] "It was like a thousand</i>
<i>4th of Julys rolled into one, "</i>

<i>an eyewitness said.</i>

705
00:38:40,952 --> 00:38:43,785
<i>But the naval bombardment</i>
<i>came too soon.</i>

706
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:47,382
<i>It was too dark for accuracy,</i>
<i>or for Walter Rosenblum's camera.</i>

707
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:51,759
<i>[Rosenblum] I couldn't go in</i>
<i>on the first wave 'cause it was dark.</i>

708
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,025
<i>There was no way</i>
<i>I could photograph.</i>

709
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:56,431
<i>Boats going in, and then</i>
<i>the landing craft came back</i>

710
00:38:56,501 --> 00:39:01,336
<i>and loaded up another crew,</i>
<i>and I went into that crew.</i>

711
00:39:01,406 --> 00:39:03,738
<i>It's like you see</i>
<i>in the movies.</i>

712
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:05,833
<i>You climb down a rope ladder,</i>

713
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:09,141
<i>and I went in on one</i>
<i>of these landing craft.</i>

714
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:12,149
<i>[Hanks] The men</i>
<i>in these later waves</i>

<i>The sight</i>
<i>of their fallen comrades.</i>

717
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:18,787
<i>[Rosenblum]</i>
<i>And we landed on the beach,</i>

718
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:21,655
<i>and the thing</i>
<i>that struck me first is</i>

719
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:24,388
<i>I'd never seen</i>
<i>a dead person in my life.</i>

720
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:25,929
<i>I was surrounded by death.</i>

721
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:27,726
<i>There was Gls in the water,</i>

722
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:29,528
rolling up and back in the water.

723
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:33,594
Blood all in the water, and it
was a very frightening sight.

724
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:41,640
<i>[Hanks] The Signal Corps cameramen</i>
<i>lived with a bitter irony.</i>

725
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:45,945
<i>Almost the entire surviving photographic</i>
<i>record of D day on the American beaches</i>

726
00:39:46,017 --> 00:39:48,383
<i>was shot</i>
<i>by coast guard cameramen.</i>

727
00:39:48,453 --> 00:39:50,421
<i>The film exposed by Rosenblum</i>

728
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:54,288
<i>and the other men of the 165th</i>
<i>Photo Company on the beaches</i>

729
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:56,725
<i>would be lost.</i>

730
00:39:56,795 --> 00:40:00,094
<i>By late morning, the beachhead</i>
<i>was established. By the end of the day,</i>

731
00:40:00,165 --> 00:40:03,828
<i>the cameramen were ready to surrender</i>
<i>their hard-won footage.</i>

732
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:07,338
<i>[Wood] We turned our footage</i>
<i>in to the beachmasters,</i>

733
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,703
<i>and they sent a colonel over</i>

734
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:12,766
<i>who went to each beachmaster</i>
<i>and picked up the film,</i>

735
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:15,108
<i>put it all in a duffel bag,</i>

736
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,980
put it on his shoulder
and went out to a ship.

737
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,644
Going up the side
of the ship, he dropped it,

738
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,653
and all the film was lost.

739
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:25,814
<i>[Hanks] There was</i>
<i>just one exception.</i>

740
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,859
<i>A cameraman named Dick Taylor.</i>

741
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:31,054
<i>He made this great shot.</i>

742
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:33,120
<i>By default, these few seconds</i>

743
00:40:33,198 --> 00:40:35,996
<i>constitute D day's</i>
<i>most famous footage.</i>

744
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:42,632
<i>[Wood] The only film you see,</i>
<i>American film from D day,</i>

745
00:40:42,707 --> 00:40:48,111
<i>was our motion-picture guy that</i>
<i>was with 1st Infantry Division.</i>

746
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:52,081
<i>He got wounded, and he carried</i>
<i>his film back with him,</i>

747
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:56,382
<i>and he got about three or four</i>
<i>scenes before he got hit.</i>

748
00:40:56,454 --> 00:41:00,049
<i>Much of Taylor's footage</i>
<i>is of combat's aftermath.</i>

749
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:03,525
<i>It is of men who have</i>
<i>spent themselves in war,</i>

750
00:41:03,595 --> 00:41:06,928
<i>trying to regather</i>
<i>their strength.</i>

751
00:41:06,998 --> 00:41:08,465
<i>They dig in.</i>

752
00:41:08,533 --> 00:41:10,660
<i>They tend to their wounded.</i>

753
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:15,472
<i>Mostly they register</i>
<i>the shock of survival.</i>

754
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:18,100
<i>Their history</i>
<i>has shrunk for the moment</i>

755
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:20,508
<i>to this one terrible day.</i>

756
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:22,876
<i>They can see nothing</i>
<i>but the awful shore</i>

757
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:24,414
<i>they so recently crossed.</i>

758
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,143
<i>They are forced to contemplate</i>

759
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:29,311
<i>the deaths they</i>
<i>by some miracle avoided.</i>

760
00:41:31,456 --> 00:41:33,924
<i>On D plus 1,</i>
<i>the supplies rolled in.</i>

761
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:37,792
<i>So did the foul weather.</i>

762
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:39,796
<i>Everywhere you looked</i>
<i>off Omaha Beach,</i>

763
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:43,129
<i>boats and their crews</i>
<i>were in peril on the seas.</i>

764
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:49,673
<i>Walter Rosenblum</i>
<i>was there shooting stills.</i>

765
00:41:49,741 --> 00:41:52,676
<i>So was his motion-picture</i>
<i>partner, Val Pope.</i>

766
00:41:52,744 --> 00:41:55,338
<i>[Rosenblum] There was</i>
<i>a couple of sinking boats</i>

767
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:57,711
<i>that I presumed</i>
<i>had been shelled,</i>

768
00:41:57,782 --> 00:42:01,878
<i>and a young army lieutenant</i>
<i>swam out with a life raft</i>

769
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:04,979
<i>in order to bring back</i>
<i>the people off the boat.</i>

770
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:13,088
<i>When I started,</i>
<i>I said to myself,</i>

771
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:16,258
"Walter, you're a good swimmer.
You have two alternatives.

772
00:42:16,334 --> 00:42:19,929
"You can go out with him
and help him bring them back,

773
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,938
or you could photograph."

774
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:25,498
And at that moment
I realized that my job

775
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:29,103
<i>was to take pictures,</i>
<i>and that's what I had to do.</i>

776
00:42:41,426 --> 00:42:44,793
<i>[Hanks] These stills and the</i>
<i>perfectly matched movie footage</i>

777
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:48,059
<i>helped fill some of the gaps left by</i>
<i>the lost D day pictures.</i>

778
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:52,632
<i>Tragically, Val Pope</i>
<i>would be killed in action</i>

779
00:42:52,704 --> 00:42:54,433
<i>a few days later.</i>

780
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:58,774
<i>[Rosenblum] The well-known</i>
<i>picture of that sequence</i>

781
00:42:58,843 --> 00:43:01,641
<i>was this young lieutenant</i>
<i>who was bending over a GI,</i>

782
00:43:01,713 --> 00:43:03,237
giving him first aid.

783
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:06,010
He looked like
the most heroic fellow

784
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:07,676
<i>I'd ever seen in my life.</i>

785
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:10,346
<i>I was happy to be able</i>
<i>to make that photograph,</i>

786
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,288
<i>because to me it epitomized</i>
<i>what the war was about.</i>

787
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:16,794
<i>People who came to fight</i>
<i>for what they believed in.</i>

788
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:20,563
Three weeks after D day,

789
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:23,600
there were almost half a million
well-supplied American soldiers

790
00:43:23,668 --> 00:43:24,999
in France.

791
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:27,435
Stephen Ambrose calls
this logistical miracle

792
00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:30,440
the great achievement of
the American people and system

793
00:43:30,508 --> 00:43:32,373
in the 20th century.

794
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,138
Who would dispute it?

795
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:36,373
Only, perhaps, the Gls

796
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,847
still struggling to break out
of their beachhead

797
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:41,646
against unforgiving terrain
and a stubborn enemy.

798
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:49,125
<i>[Hanks] On the ghostly beaches,</i>
<i>the barrage balloons arose,</i>

799
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:51,252
<i>protecting the masses</i>
<i>of incoming supplies</i>

800
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:53,797
<i>against the almost</i>
<i>entirely absent</i> Luftwaffe.

801
00:43:58,102 --> 00:44:01,230
<i>Everywhere,</i>
<i>casualties were counted.</i>

802
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,637
<i>They were heavy</i>
<i>among the airborne troops,</i>

803
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:07,166
<i>but the planners</i>
<i>were ready for death, too.</i>

804
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:09,645
<i>It was neatly registered.</i>

805
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:13,249
<i>The high command</i>
<i>and their tankers</i>

806
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:16,775
<i>were less well-prepared for</i>
<i>a unique and hazardous feature</i>

807
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:18,583
<i>of Normandy's topography.</i>

808
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,647
<i>[Wood]</i>
<i>All through Normandy there,</i>

809
00:44:20,725 --> 00:44:22,659
<i>it was all through</i>
<i>hedgerow country.</i>

810
00:44:22,727 --> 00:44:25,992
<i>They were about six foot high</i>
<i>and six foot thick</i>

811
00:44:26,064 --> 00:44:29,397
<i>and got trees growing out of the tops,</i>
<i>and they're real fortresses.</i>

812
00:44:29,467 --> 00:44:31,799
<i>We could be digging in</i>
<i>on one side of a hedgerow</i>

813
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:35,361
and the Germans would be digging in
on the other side of it.

814
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:40,243
<i>[Wood] There would be</i>
<i>little openings</i>

815
00:44:40,311 --> 00:44:42,245
<i>with gates and stuff</i>
<i>through them,</i>

816
00:44:42,313 --> 00:44:46,374
<i>and guys would have to attack through</i>
<i>those damn things or over the top of one.</i>

817
00:44:46,451 --> 00:44:49,545
<i>[Hanks] The hedgerows,</i>
<i>first planted in the Middle Ages,</i>

818
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,747
<i>frustrated the war of movement,</i>

819
00:44:51,823 --> 00:44:53,848
<i>but not for long.</i>

820
00:44:53,925 --> 00:44:55,358
<i>[Wood]</i>
<i>An ordnance sergeant</i>

821
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:58,088
<i>figured out that he could weld</i>

822
00:44:58,162 --> 00:45:00,824
<i>two big prongs</i>
<i>on the front of a tank,</i>

823
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:03,662
<i>and they'd dig</i>
<i>into the hedgerow,</i>

824
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:06,897
<i>and the tank would shove</i>
<i>its way through a hedgerow.</i>

825
00:45:06,971 --> 00:45:10,372
<i>After we got that,</i>
<i>it made it a lot simpler.</i>

826
00:45:14,578 --> 00:45:16,603
Some 60 years ago,

827
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:20,207
an anonymous German bureaucrat
poked his finger on a map

828
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:23,219
and decreed that here,
in this French farmer's fields,

829
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:25,983
would be the site
of these big coastal batteries.

830
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,819
They're still there today,

831
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:32,090
silent yet ominous reminders
of the way in which war

832
00:45:32,163 --> 00:45:35,360
intrudes itself
on ordinary human life.

833
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:38,924
And yet that life
has an amazing stubbornness.

834
00:45:39,003 --> 00:45:40,561
The guns may thunder,

835
00:45:40,638 --> 00:45:43,300
<i>but the fields</i>
<i>must still be harvested.</i>

836
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:49,873
<i>The geese</i>
<i>have to cross the road,</i>

837
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:53,280
<i>even if it's choked</i>
<i>with military traffic.</i>

838
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:56,376
<i>The ordinary skein</i>
<i>of human life goes on,</i>

839
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:59,513
and our cameramen
recorded that, too.

840
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,925
<i>[Hanks] The young liberators</i>
<i>were bored, restless, coltish</i>

841
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:10,762
<i>when they were off duty.</i>

842
00:46:10,835 --> 00:46:14,271
<i>These American airmen discovered</i>
<i>these horses in a Norman pasture.</i>

843
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:16,772
<i>One of them</i>
<i>was an Oklahoma cowboy,</i>

844
00:46:16,841 --> 00:46:18,809
<i>who for a moment</i>
<i>gracefully recaptured</i>

845
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:21,436
<i>one of civilian life's</i>
<i>lost pleasures.</i>

846
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:23,571
<i>[Rosenblum]</i>
<i>It was not commonly known</i>

847
00:46:23,647 --> 00:46:25,410
<i>that our preinvasion</i>
<i>bombardment</i>

848
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:29,248
<i>killed a lot of French people</i>
<i>who were living behind the line.</i>

849
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,254
<i>I was always amazed at the fact</i>

850
00:46:31,322 --> 00:46:33,085
that the French people I photographed

851
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:35,557
didn't blame the Americans
for what was taking place.

852
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:38,459
<i>They regarded us as liberators,</i>
<i>even though our bombs</i>

853
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:41,623
<i>killed some of the people</i>
<i>who lived there.</i>

854
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:46,232
<i>[Hanks] There was a sweetness</i>
<i>in these welcomes, and a certain haste.</i>

855
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:48,237
<i>After the Normandy breakout,</i>

856
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,899
<i>if finally became</i>
<i>a war of movement.</i>

857
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:53,307
<i>And for this Free French</i>
<i>tank battalion,</i>

858
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:55,140
<i>it was a very personal war,</i>

859
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:57,942
<i>as Russ Meyer learned</i>
<i>when he joined them.</i>

860
00:46:58,015 --> 00:46:59,277
<i>Right off the bat,</i>

861
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:02,376
took our jeep with the tank.

862
00:47:02,453 --> 00:47:05,286
The French tank.
We'd go right between them.

863
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:09,315
<i>[Hanks] His best</i>
<i>wartime buddy, Bill Teas,</i>

864
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:11,327
<i>was already</i>
<i>with the French unit.</i>

865
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:13,329
<i>He would lend his name</i>
<i>to the title</i>

866
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:15,331
<i>of Meyer's first</i>
<i>postwar erotic hit,</i>

867
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:17,993
The lmmoral Mr. Teas.

868
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:21,435
<i>Needless to say, the French tankers</i>
<i>were welcomed with special warmth</i>

869
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,439
<i>as they rolled through</i>
<i>their native land.</i>

870
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:27,637
<i>The Americans</i>
<i>were included in that welcome.</i>

871
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:31,807
<i>[Meyer] They would all say,</i>
"Oh, Américain. Très bien."

872
00:47:33,484 --> 00:47:35,577
<i>[Hanks] There was danger</i>
<i>on these roads, too.</i>

873
00:47:35,653 --> 00:47:39,282
<i>[Meyer] You go down the street,</i>
<i>and the guy says, "Stop now!</i>

874
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:42,484
<i>"Don't go. There's a bunch</i>
<i>of Germans down that road.</i>

875
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:45,255
Now get the hell out of there."

876
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:48,992
<i>[Hanks] Forewarned, they engaged</i>
<i>in a brief, violent firefight.</i>

877
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:50,795
<i>This time, they took prisoners.</i>

878
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:54,634
<i>I'd love to know the guy today.</i>

879
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:57,435
<i>If we hadn't been warned,</i>
<i>we would have had our...</i>

880
00:47:57,508 --> 00:47:59,669
They would have gotten
our tonsils.

881
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:03,235
<i>[Hanks] But they</i>
<i>weren't always so lucky.</i>

882
00:48:03,314 --> 00:48:06,477
<i>In a later engagement,</i>
<i>they took heavy losses.</i>

883
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,678
<i>As was so often the case</i>
<i>in tank battles,</i>

884
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:11,778
<i>the wounds were ghastly.</i>

885
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:13,914
<i>And hard to accept.</i>

886
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:15,754
<i>As some of the tankers</i>

887
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:17,760
<i>struggled to free</i>
<i>a trapped comrade,</i>

888
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:20,797
<i>others rethought the battle</i>
<i>and refought it.</i>

889
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:24,897
<i>There was a desire</i>
<i>to protect the home front</i>

890
00:48:24,969 --> 00:48:26,960
<i>from war's harshest realities.</i>

891
00:48:27,037 --> 00:48:28,766
<i>If these had been Americans,</i>

892
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:31,171
<i>these pictures</i>
<i>might not have been taken.</i>

893
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:33,175
<i>[Meyer]</i>
<i>You didn't want to get Gls.</i>

894
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:34,938
<i>You didn't want a GI dying.</i>

895
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:36,536
<i>If it was, I'd get something</i>

896
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:39,878
where at least the American
wouldn't be readily recognized.

897
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:41,918
I was concerned
about their family

898
00:48:41,986 --> 00:48:43,977
that would see somebody
in the newsreels.

899
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:47,456
<i>[Hanks]</i>
<i>But Paris was nearly at hand,</i>

900
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:50,857
<i>less than three months</i>
<i>after D day.</i>

901
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,293
<i>As the liberators approached,</i>

902
00:48:52,363 --> 00:48:54,991
<i>the Communist-led underground</i>
<i>rose against the Germans.</i>

903
00:48:57,868 --> 00:48:59,961
<i>In the streets,</i>
<i>the German tanks were opposed</i>

904
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:03,268
<i>by members of the resistance</i>
<i>carrying only small arms.</i>

905
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:06,036
<i>Amazingly, they forced</i>
<i>an uneasy truce.</i>

906
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:09,443
<i>It is possible they prevented</i>
<i>the destruction of the city</i>

907
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:11,276
<i>that Hitler had ordered.</i>

908
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:24,390
<i>[Hanks] The honor</i>
<i>of entering Paris first</i>

909
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,986
<i>was given</i>
<i>to Free French forces.</i>

910
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:29,362
<i>But as their leaders</i>
<i>boldly showed themselves,</i>

911
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:31,298
<i>gunfire erupted.</i>

912
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:32,926
There was de Gaulle

913
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:35,096
and I forget which
other officers were there.

914
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:36,662
LeClerc had to be there.

915
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:39,868
<i>[Hanks] The city had not been</i>
<i>cleared of German troops</i>

916
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:41,877
<i>and their French sympathizers.</i>

917
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:44,880
<i>[Weiner] They all came marching</i>
<i>down the Champs Elysées</i>

918
00:49:44,948 --> 00:49:47,644
<i>as part of this parade,</i>

919
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:50,448
<i>and there were snipers,</i>
<i>and there were shots fired.</i>

920
00:49:50,521 --> 00:49:52,921
<i>And, of course,</i>
<i>everybody ducked.</i>

921
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,926
<i>[Hanks] The street fighting was</i>
<i>actually intense and deadly.</i>

922
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:04,100
<i>In many places, people</i>
<i>were pinned to the ground,</i>

923
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:05,192
<i>unable to move.</i>

924
00:50:05,269 --> 00:50:07,396
<i>The terror was palpable.</i>

925
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:16,779
<i>Reprisals against</i>
<i>French collaborators</i>

926
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,838
<i>were swift and harsh.</i>

927
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,849
<i>That was not the end</i>
<i>of French vengeance.</i>

928
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:26,219
<i>[Weiner] We were advised of activity</i>
<i>regarding collaborationists,</i>

929
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:28,588
<i>and what they were doing</i>
<i>is taking,</i>

930
00:50:28,659 --> 00:50:30,854
<i>in this case,</i>
<i>women collaborationists</i>

931
00:50:30,928 --> 00:50:32,919
<i>and shaving their heads.</i>

932
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:37,057
<i>These are, I guess, women</i>
<i>who had socially gone out</i>

933
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:40,228
<i>or played around with some</i>
<i>of the German soldiers.</i>

934
00:50:43,107 --> 00:50:45,098
<i>The idea, as I understood it,</i>

935
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:47,268
was that for weeks
and months afterwards,

936
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:50,142
everybody would know
who the collaborationists were.

937
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:54,316
<i>[Weiner] For the most part,</i>
<i>they said nothing.</i>

938
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:58,320
<i>Some smiled and some</i>
<i>just stared straight ahead...</i>

939
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:01,221
<i>and I guess tried</i>
<i>to make the best</i>

940
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:03,418
<i>of what they were faced with.</i>

941
00:51:03,494 --> 00:51:07,260
<i>[Hanks] The Allies had</i>
<i>first intended to bypass Paris,</i>

942
00:51:07,331 --> 00:51:09,765
<i>but it was unavoidably</i>
<i>in their path.</i>

943
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:11,994
<i>Most of these soldiers</i>
<i>did not stop.</i>

944
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,731
<i>For them, Paris was just</i>
<i>a quickly glimpsed place</i>

945
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:16,466
<i>on the road to victory.</i>

946
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:20,334
<i>In a smaller French city,</i>

947
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,243
<i>Fred Bornet</i>
<i>found the joy of liberation</i>

948
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:25,941
<i>more freely expressed</i>
<i>and more directable.</i>

949
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:28,484
<i>[Bornet] The people</i>
<i>were out in the street,</i>

950
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:33,080
<i>and they were</i>
<i>just absolutely ecstatic.</i>

951
00:51:33,157 --> 00:51:35,625
<i>Hysterical with delight.</i>

952
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:37,421
<i>And they hung bunting,</i>

953
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:40,429
<i>and they'd lift</i>
<i>glasses of wine.</i>

954
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:44,092
<i>And what is so great is that</i>
<i>you don't have a script.</i>

955
00:51:44,168 --> 00:51:46,227
<i>You seize</i>
<i>those wonderful moments.</i>

956
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:51,468
<i>And there were lots of girls,</i>
<i>flowers in their hair.</i>

957
00:51:51,542 --> 00:51:53,567
<i>They were sort of</i>
<i>waving and greeting.</i>

958
00:51:53,644 --> 00:51:57,740
But they were not doing it...

959
00:51:57,814 --> 00:51:59,611
with enough enthusiasm.

960
00:51:59,683 --> 00:52:02,516
I thought this is
such a great moment.

961
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:05,111
<i>It should be like</i>
<i>the big parade.</i>

962
00:52:08,759 --> 00:52:11,284
<i>So I said to the girl, "Look.</i>

963
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:16,230
<i>"When that stream of soldiers</i>
<i>is walking by,</i>

964
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,825
<i>run against that stream</i>
<i>and kiss them!"</i>

965
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:30,409
<i>And I cried.</i>
<i>There was a release.</i>

966
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,278
<i>And then they offered me soup</i>

967
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:35,614
<i>and fried eggs,</i>

968
00:52:35,686 --> 00:52:38,177
<i>and they were waving flags.</i>

969
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:40,780
You have a feeling that

970
00:52:40,857 --> 00:52:45,294
you're doing something
that is worthwhile.

971
00:52:45,363 --> 00:52:47,661
In the fall of 1944,

972
00:52:47,732 --> 00:52:50,166
American eyes
were fixed on Europe,

973
00:52:50,234 --> 00:52:51,667
where headquarters spoke,

974
00:52:51,736 --> 00:52:53,670
overconfidently,
as it turned out,

975
00:52:53,738 --> 00:52:57,538
of the war's end
being in sight, almost within reach.

976
00:52:57,608 --> 00:53:00,839
No such claims were made
for the war in the Pacific.

977
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:03,607
Combat there was as brutal
and furious as ever.

978
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:07,048
But many of its fighting men
felt isolated and ignored.

979
00:53:07,118 --> 00:53:09,143
Navy cameraman Sam Sorenson.

980
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:11,552
<i>[Sorenson] The marines</i>
<i>that I worked with</i>

981
00:53:11,622 --> 00:53:15,353
<i>were happy to have</i>
<i>some pictures taken of them.</i>

982
00:53:15,426 --> 00:53:18,361
<i>In the Pacific,</i>
<i>they were so lonely.</i>

983
00:53:18,429 --> 00:53:20,920
<i>They never saw a woman.</i>

984
00:53:20,998 --> 00:53:22,431
One of the reasons

985
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,333
that I was happy
to work with the marines

986
00:53:25,403 --> 00:53:28,964
was because we got better
pictures of combat action.

987
00:53:30,107 --> 00:53:33,133
<i>[Hanks]</i>
<i>Peleliu, September 1944.</i>

988
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:37,442
<i>The fury of the naval and air</i>
<i>bombardment was unprecedented.</i>

989
00:53:37,515 --> 00:53:40,109
<i>[Sorenson] For three days</i>
<i>we shelled that thing.</i>

990
00:53:40,184 --> 00:53:42,744
<i>When we approached</i>
<i>those islands,</i>

991
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:46,551
<i>it looked like little, nice,</i>
<i>green rolling hills.</i>

992
00:53:46,624 --> 00:53:48,387
<i>When we got through,</i>

993
00:53:48,459 --> 00:53:51,451
<i>it looked like little, rugged,</i>
<i>jagged mountains.</i>

994
00:53:51,529 --> 00:53:53,463
<i>There were little</i>
<i>coral mountains</i>

995
00:53:53,531 --> 00:53:55,499
<i>sticking up all over.</i>

996
00:53:55,566 --> 00:54:00,697
<i>I couldn't believe</i>
<i>anything could live on there.</i>

997
00:54:00,771 --> 00:54:02,671
<i>[Hanks] But the bombing</i>
<i>was ineffective.</i>

998
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:05,903
<i>The enemy remained safe</i>
<i>in their bunkers.</i>

999
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:08,342
<i>[Sorenson]</i>
<i>So when the marines started in,</i>

1000
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:10,846
<i>there was an outer reef.</i>

1001
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:13,406
<i>And they got hung up</i>
<i>on that reef.</i>

1002
00:54:13,484 --> 00:54:15,918
<i>They were caught</i>
<i>in Japanese crossfire.</i>

1003
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:18,819
<i>So a lot of them</i>
<i>had to unload there</i>

1004
00:54:18,889 --> 00:54:23,792
<i>and go on in</i>
<i>with amphibious tractors.</i>

1005
00:54:23,861 --> 00:54:25,954
<i>Then when they hit the beach,</i>

1006
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:29,557
<i>they got raked from</i>
<i>this "point," they call it.</i>

1007
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:32,500
<i>[Hanks] The irony of Peleliu</i>
<i>is that it was unnecessary.</i>

1008
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:34,538
<i>General MacArthur</i>
<i>thought he needed it</i>

1009
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,698
<i>to shield his invasion</i>
<i>of the Philippines.</i>

1010
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:40,175
<i>Military historians</i>
<i>now agree that he did not.</i>

1011

<i>His ordeal wasn't over.</i>

1046
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:26,281

<i>to risk his life for him.</i>

1048

stepped across me,
said, "I'll get it."

So, there was a puff of wind,

1062

<i>that it was critically cold</i>

1066
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:30,402

<i>that you could hide from.</i>

1068

<i>The Ardennes</i>
<i>did not have big trees.</i>

<i>You had to be very careful</i>

1070
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:43,515
<i>and get down</i>
<i>at the base of a tree trunk...</i>

1079
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:12,812
<i>Many of the Gls</i>
<i>fought tenaciously,</i>

<i>Their motors provided warmth.</i>

1095

<i>[Bates] I rattled this tank and asked</i>
<i>if I could ride on the back.</i>

<i>A lid flew open, and he says,</i>
<i>"Can you fire a machine gun?"</i>

00:59:03,273 --> 00:59:06,538
<i>I said I had my basics</i>
<i>with the 11th Armored Division.</i>

<i>and put me</i>
<i>in the bow gunner's position.</i>

<i>but he was heading into battle</i>
<i>with German Tiger tanks.</i>

1102
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:21,315

<i>of a German ambulance</i>

<i>aiding one of</i>
<i>their wounded tank crews.</i>

<i>[Bates] I could see</i>
<i>that the number one tank</i>

<i>had passed an open area</i>
<i>and was firing uphill.</i>

<i>About that time,</i>
<i>I could hear this "kah-thunk,"</i>

"Get out. They're shooting at us."

<i>About that time,</i>
<i>that second "whoom" came along,</i>

<i>and it felt like a train</i>
<i>hit me in the back.</i>

00:59:42,379 --> 00:59:44,939
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>whether I was dead or alive.</i>

<i>If he starts that tank again,</i>
<i>he's going to run over you. "</i>

00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:53,956
<i>I looked back, and my camera was</i>
<i>laying under the tank treads.</i>

1114
00:59:54,024 --> 00:59:56,754
<i>That's what made me move,</i>
<i>and on the radio they said,</i>

<i>"You get up here quick</i>
<i>with the medic's jeep.</i>

<i>He sent his driver</i>

1150
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:42,494
<i>were rounded up</i>
<i>and shot by S.S. Troops.</i>

1151
01:01:44,634 --> 01:01:46,568
<i>They had infiltrated our lines,</i>

1152
01:01:46,636 --> 01:01:48,627
<i>some of them wearing</i>
<i>American uniforms.</i>

1153
01:01:50,006 --> 01:01:52,566
<i>In this last-gasp</i>
<i>German effort,</i>

1154
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:54,837
<i>many of their troops</i>
<i>were teenagers.</i>

1155
01:01:56,746 --> 01:01:59,647
<i>The Germans all escaped</i>
<i>serious punishment for Malmedy</i>

1156
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:02,344
<i>at the war crimes trials.</i>

1157
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:06,255
<i>The weather lifted</i>
<i>in late December,</i>

1158
01:02:06,322 --> 01:02:08,256
<i>and air operations resumed.</i>

1159
01:02:08,324 --> 01:02:11,350
<i>[Man] I was fortunate enough,</i>
<i>or unfortunate,</i>

1160
01:02:11,427 --> 01:02:13,657
whichever way you want to look at it,

1161
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,494
to lead the greatest air
combat battle of World War II.

1162
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:18,329
<i>There was eight of us.</i>

1163
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:20,335
<i>We had climbed up</i>
<i>over the field,</i>

1164
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,394
<i>and we were what</i>
<i>they called "joining up"</i>

1165
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:25,168
<i>when 900 German fighters</i>
<i>made an attack</i>

1166
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:28,210
<i>on the front</i>
<i>on January 1, 1945.</i>

1167
01:02:28,278 --> 01:02:29,802
<i>The squadron leader...</i>

1168
01:02:29,879 --> 01:02:32,313
<i>a squadron would normally</i>
<i>be 12 airplanes,</i>

1169
01:02:32,382 --> 01:02:34,748
<i>but we had eight...</i>
<i>he couldn't see them.</i>

1170
01:02:34,817 --> 01:02:37,650
<i>He said,</i>
<i>"You take over the flight."</i>

1171
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:41,315
<i>And I dropped five of them</i>
<i>right on the field.</i>

1172
01:02:41,391 --> 01:02:43,655
<i>[Hanks] The pilots,</i>
<i>armed with their gun cameras,</i>

1173
01:02:43,726 --> 01:02:45,523
<i>were also combat cameramen.</i>

1174
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,756
<i>[Paisley]</i>
<i>Hitler had decided</i>

1175
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:52,460
<i>that he would deploy</i>
<i>all of the fighters he had</i>

1176
01:02:52,535 --> 01:02:55,265
<i>to knock out the fighter fields</i>

1177
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:57,306
<i>to support</i>
<i>the Battle of the Bulge,</i>

1178
01:02:57,373 --> 01:03:00,069
<i>and they were going to do it</i>
<i>in early December,</i>

1179
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:02,543
<i>which would have been</i>
<i>very effective.</i>

1180
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,079
<i>Weather wasn't good.</i>

1181
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:06,741
<i>They put it off</i>
<i>and put it off and said,</i>

1182
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:09,376
<i>"January 1st, these guys</i>
<i>will all be in bed. "</i>

1183
01:03:11,221 --> 01:03:15,180
<i>It was all over the front.</i>
<i>It wasn't just at our field.</i>

1184
01:03:15,258 --> 01:03:17,226
<i>It was at the British field.</i>

1185
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:20,160
<i>It was at all</i>
<i>the northern airfields.</i>

1186
01:03:21,764 --> 01:03:25,461
<i>I later got a hold of</i>
<i>Hermann Goering's interviews.</i>

1187
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:28,333
<i>In those interviews,</i>
<i>Goering said</i>

1188
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:33,501
<i>the largest loss that</i>
<i>the German</i> Luftwaffe <i>ever had</i>

1189
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:36,306
<i>was the loss on January 1st.</i>

1190
01:03:36,379 --> 01:03:39,507
<i>[Hanks] Mel Paisley, who was also</i>
<i>this film's chief researcher,</i>

1191
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:42,346
<i>was decorated with the</i>
<i>Distinguished Service Cross.</i>

1192
01:03:42,418 --> 01:03:45,444
<i>Over the course of the war,</i>
<i>he shot down nine planes.</i>

1193
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:50,481
<i>The Battle of the Bulge</i>
<i>ended January 7, 1945.</i>

1194
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,960
<i>Germany was now largely open</i>
<i>to the Allies.</i>

1195
01:03:55,132 --> 01:03:57,362
<i>Italy 1945.</i>

1196
01:03:57,434 --> 01:04:00,028
<i>Dictator Benito Mussolini</i>
<i>was deposed and exiled.</i>

1197
01:04:00,104 --> 01:04:01,969
<i>The government surrendered,</i>

1198
01:04:02,039 --> 01:04:05,065
<i>and the populace turned viciously</i>
<i>on their former allies.</i>

1199
01:04:07,611 --> 01:04:10,808
<i>[Montagne] I went to the C.P.</i>
<i>To find out what was happening</i>

1200
01:04:10,881 --> 01:04:12,746
<i>and was told</i>
<i>they had captured Mussolini</i>

1201
01:04:12,816 --> 01:04:15,580
<i>and General Crittenberger</i>
<i>was to take his surrender.</i>

1202
01:04:15,653 --> 01:04:19,646
<i>I went down to the C.P. About</i>
<i>5:00 the following morning,</i>

1203
01:04:19,723 --> 01:04:23,352
<i>and here's a limousine with</i>
<i>three German officers in it.</i>

1204
01:04:23,427 --> 01:04:25,657
<i>They'd been picked up</i>
<i>by the 1st Armored Division.</i>

1205
01:04:25,729 --> 01:04:27,890
<i>They'd run into a roadblock</i>
<i>and captured.</i>

1206
01:04:27,965 --> 01:04:30,195
I went to Crit and said,
"What are you going to do?"

1207
01:04:30,267 --> 01:04:32,599
He said, "I'm going to get
this bird's surrender."

1208
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:35,935
I said, "What about Mussolini?"
He said, "Mussolini will have to wait."

1209
01:04:36,006 --> 01:04:37,940
<i>I'll never forget that line.</i>

1210
01:04:38,008 --> 01:04:40,909
<i>He said to him, "General,</i>
<i>we're both professionals.</i>

1211
01:04:40,978 --> 01:04:44,072
<i>"You can't get out.</i>
<i>The passes are all closed.</i>

1212
01:04:44,148 --> 01:04:46,878
<i>"The smart thing to do</i>
<i>is surrender the Ligurian Army,</i>

1213
01:04:46,951 --> 01:04:50,785
<i>which is the last</i>
<i>intact enemy army. "</i>

1214
01:04:50,854 --> 01:04:54,085
<i>Went back to see Crit,</i>
<i>and he was sitting on a rail</i>

1215
01:04:54,158 --> 01:04:56,353
<i>and sort of dreaming,</i>
<i>and he said,</i>

1216
01:04:56,427 --> 01:04:59,726
<i>"Montagne, do you know</i>
<i>that every cadet at West Point</i>

1217
01:04:59,797 --> 01:05:04,598
<i>"dreams of the day when an enemy army</i>
<i>surrenders to him?</i>

1218
01:05:04,668 --> 01:05:06,829
Today it happened to me."

1219
01:05:06,904 --> 01:05:09,304
<i>[Hanks] Crittenberger's</i>
<i>decision doomed Mussolini,</i>

1220
01:05:09,373 --> 01:05:11,534
<i>his mistress, Clara Petacci,</i>
<i>and other fascists</i>

1221
01:05:11,609 --> 01:05:14,373
<i>to death at the hands</i>
<i>of partisan guerillas.</i>

1222
01:05:14,445 --> 01:05:17,107
<i>Their bodies</i>
<i>were displayed in Milan.</i>

1223
01:05:17,181 --> 01:05:20,742
<i>[Montagne] It had been going on for</i>
<i>quite some time when we got there.</i>

1224
01:05:20,818 --> 01:05:24,879
<i>And we photographed what</i>
<i>we could. We got the crowds.</i>

1225
01:05:24,955 --> 01:05:26,923
<i>We got Mussolini</i>
<i>hanging upside down,</i>

1226
01:05:26,991 --> 01:05:29,323
<i>Petacci alongside him.</i>

1227
01:05:29,393 --> 01:05:32,089
<i>I remember her skirt</i>
<i>had fallen over her face,</i>

1228
01:05:32,162 --> 01:05:34,460
<i>and a woman came</i>
<i>and pinned her skirt</i>

1229
01:05:34,531 --> 01:05:37,091
between her legs
so she wasn't exposed.

1230
01:05:38,936 --> 01:05:41,700
<i>They cut him down...</i>
<i>I remember he got his head hit...</i>

1231
01:05:41,772 --> 01:05:43,205
<i>and picked him up.</i>

1232
01:05:43,274 --> 01:05:47,176
<i>The partisans were running it.</i>
<i>We had nothing to do with it.</i>

1233
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:52,045
<i>They took them over</i>
<i>to the morgue.</i>

1234
01:05:52,116 --> 01:05:54,380
<i>There were bodies</i>
<i>all over the place.</i>

1235
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:58,854
<i>You had to walk on two or three bodies</i>
<i>to get to where Mussolini was.</i>

1236
01:05:58,922 --> 01:06:01,390
<i>And I asked</i>
<i>the morgue attendant,</i>

1237
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:03,392
<i>"Can you get him in the light?"</i>

1238
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:07,089
<i>He said, "Lieutenant, if I move him,</i>
<i>his head will fall apart. "</i>

1239
01:06:07,164 --> 01:06:09,098
<i>So he got Petacci,</i>
<i>pulled her over</i>

1240
01:06:09,166 --> 01:06:11,293
<i>and put her head</i>
<i>on his shoulder.</i>

1241
01:06:11,368 --> 01:06:13,962
<i>Became quite a famous shot.</i>

1242
01:06:16,407 --> 01:06:19,501
<i>[Hanks] Meantime, Nazi Germany</i>
<i>was in its death throes,</i>

1243
01:06:19,576 --> 01:06:21,407
<i>but it desperately fought on.</i>

1244
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:25,505
Everything that could happen to me,

1245
01:06:25,582 --> 01:06:28,813
<i>photographically speaking,</i>
<i>did happen that day.</i>

1246
01:06:28,886 --> 01:06:33,949
<i>[Hanks] The place was Cologne.</i>
<i>The date was March 6, 1945.</i>

1247
01:06:34,024 --> 01:06:36,015
<i>The street fighting</i>
<i>was intense.</i>

1248
01:06:38,429 --> 01:06:41,762
<i>It was often impossible to tell</i>
<i>soldiers from civilians.</i>

1249
01:06:41,832 --> 01:06:43,925
<i>Sometimes the victims</i>
<i>caught in the crossfire</i>

1250
01:06:44,001 --> 01:06:45,525
<i>were entirely innocent.</i>

1251
01:06:47,171 --> 01:06:49,969
<i>[Bates] By this time</i>
<i>we had a new T-26.</i>

1252
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:53,009
<i>The T-26 was so far ahead</i>
<i>of the old Shermans,</i>

1253
01:06:53,077 --> 01:06:54,840
<i>it was unbelievable.</i>

1254
01:06:54,912 --> 01:06:58,439
<i>This German tank was sitting in front</i>
<i>of the Cologne Cathedral.</i>

1255
01:06:58,515 --> 01:07:01,882
<i>It had knocked out a number</i>
<i>of our tanks and causing havoc.</i>

1256
01:07:01,952 --> 01:07:04,580
<i>They had control</i>
<i>over that whole area.</i>

1257
01:07:05,956 --> 01:07:09,517
<i>[Hanks] Bates followed the tank into battle,</i>
<i>and, scrambling for position,</i>

1258
01:07:09,593 --> 01:07:12,892
<i>got this great footage</i>
<i>of armored combat.</i>

1259
01:07:12,963 --> 01:07:15,022
<i>[Bates] I heard</i>
<i>our T-26 coming up.</i>

1260
01:07:15,099 --> 01:07:17,226
<i>The first shot went in</i>

1261
01:07:17,301 --> 01:07:21,795
<i>and cut the legs off of the</i>
<i>tank commander in the Tiger.</i>

1262
01:07:21,872 --> 01:07:24,898
<i>In the film you can see</i>
<i>the armor-piercing shell</i>

1263
01:07:24,975 --> 01:07:27,443
<i>going through</i>
<i>the bottom of the picture.</i>

1264
01:07:27,511 --> 01:07:30,912
<i>Immediately, the driver and</i>
<i>bow gunner, they climbed out,</i>

1265
01:07:30,981 --> 01:07:34,815
<i>but the second shot shrapnel</i>
<i>had gotten them, too.</i>

1266
01:07:34,885 --> 01:07:36,853
<i>The concussion</i>
<i>from that 90-millimeter gun</i>

1267
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:41,220
<i>is so tremendous that it would</i>
<i>just blow me off my picture,</i>

1268
01:07:41,291 --> 01:07:43,816
<i>and I'd have to</i>
<i>get back on it again.</i>

1269
01:07:43,894 --> 01:07:47,125
<i>I couldn't use a tripod.</i>
<i>I had to hand hold it.</i>

1270
01:07:48,465 --> 01:07:51,434
<i>The tank commander</i>
<i>that had his legs cut off</i>

1271
01:07:51,502 --> 01:07:55,632
<i>just laid on top of his tank and</i>
<i>burned up in front of the camera.</i>

1272
01:07:55,706 --> 01:07:58,140
<i>That thing was burning</i>
<i>even the next morning.</i>

1273
01:07:58,208 --> 01:08:01,575
<i>After it was all over,</i>
<i>there was still smoke coming out of it</i>

1274
01:08:01,645 --> 01:08:04,876
<i>because it had so much</i>
<i>ammunition and whatnot in it.</i>

1275
01:08:04,948 --> 01:08:09,078
<i>[Hanks] Two months and one day later,</i>
<i>the war in Europe was over.</i>

1276
01:08:11,188 --> 01:08:13,122
<i>Its dead, its "crusaders,"</i>

1277
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:15,124
<i>as General Eisenhower</i>
<i>called them,</i>

1278
01:08:15,192 --> 01:08:17,626
<i>rest in cemeteries</i>
<i>all over Europe.</i>

1279
01:08:17,694 --> 01:08:20,322
<i>If anything, their deeds</i>
<i>are more revered now</i>

1280
01:08:20,397 --> 01:08:22,422
<i>than they were at the time.</i>

1281
01:08:22,499 --> 01:08:24,433
<i>Some of their immortality</i>

1282
01:08:24,501 --> 01:08:26,992
<i>derives from</i>
<i>the photographic record.</i>

1283
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:31,063
The combat cameramen
recorded the last days,

1284
01:08:31,141 --> 01:08:33,336
hours, moments,
even the last breath

1285
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:35,742
of many of those who lie here.

1286
01:08:35,813 --> 01:08:38,611
It isn't something
that they talk about very much.

1287
01:08:38,682 --> 01:08:41,845
It was, as they say,
just a part of their job.

1288
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:46,651
<i>[Ambrose] But it was a more</i>
<i>important job than they knew.</i>

1289
01:08:46,723 --> 01:08:51,387
<i>For the film they made is now</i>
<i>beginning to outlive memory.</i>

1290
01:08:51,462 --> 01:08:55,330
<i>Eventually it will be the only</i>
<i>recollection made on the spot</i>

1291
01:08:55,399 --> 01:08:57,731
<i>of how our citizen soldiers</i>

1292
01:08:57,801 --> 01:09:00,634
<i>lived, fought and died.</i>

1293
01:09:00,704 --> 01:09:04,504
<i>[Hanks] The cameramen in Europe</i>
<i>had one more duty to history.</i>

1294
01:09:04,574 --> 01:09:07,702
<i>It was unquestionably</i>
<i>their most important one.</i>

1295
01:09:07,777 --> 01:09:10,803
<i>That was recording</i>
<i>the horrors of the death camps.</i>

1296
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:14,611
<i>At Dachau, Walter Rosenblum</i>
<i>was too shocked to shoot.</i>

1297
01:09:14,684 --> 01:09:17,346
<i>These pictures</i>
<i>were made by others.</i>

1298
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:19,354
<i>[Rosenblum]</i>
<i>There was a group of boxcars.</i>

1299
01:09:19,422 --> 01:09:22,357
<i>I climbed up the boxcar</i>
<i>to see what was inside.</i>

1300
01:09:22,425 --> 01:09:24,950
<i>And the boxcar</i>
<i>was full of dead people,</i>

1301
01:09:25,028 --> 01:09:27,963
<i>and there were about</i>
<i>30, 40 boxcars along that road.</i>

1302
01:09:28,031 --> 01:09:31,023
<i>When I looked in,</i>
<i>I was so shocked.</i>

1303
01:09:31,101 --> 01:09:34,628
<i>Could you imagine, not having</i>
<i>seen anything like that before,</i>

1304
01:09:34,704 --> 01:09:39,038
<i>to see a boxcar</i>
<i>full of dead, emaciated people?</i>

1305
01:09:39,109 --> 01:09:40,542
<i>At that particular moment,</i>

1306
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:42,373
I forgot I was a photographer.

1307
01:09:42,445 --> 01:09:45,175
I was just overcome by it all.

1308
01:09:45,248 --> 01:09:47,546
<i>[Man] I was on assignment</i>
<i>with Ellis Carter,</i>

1309
01:09:47,617 --> 01:09:50,552
<i>and we went into Germany</i>
<i>to cover bomb damage</i>

1310
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:52,747
<i>that was done</i>
<i>by the Allied air power.</i>

1311
01:09:52,822 --> 01:09:57,816
<i>On April 11th, the 3rd</i>
<i>U.S. Army liberated Buchenwald,</i>

1312
01:09:57,894 --> 01:10:01,853
<i>and when we heard of this, we</i>
<i>immediately drove over there.</i>

1313
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:04,263
<i>[Hanks] What the cameramen</i>
<i>found behind these gates</i>

1314
01:10:04,334 --> 01:10:06,097
<i>was beyond their imagining,</i>

1315
01:10:06,169 --> 01:10:08,433
<i>but the inhumanity</i>
<i>they recorded</i>

1316
01:10:08,505 --> 01:10:11,133
<i>is literally undeniable.</i>

1317
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:13,141
As a soldier in the American Army,

1318
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:15,040
I had no knowledge of these camps

1319
01:10:15,111 --> 01:10:17,272
and had not heard anything about it.

1320
01:10:19,883 --> 01:10:21,316
<i>[Mainzer]</i>
<i>It was horrible.</i>

1321
01:10:21,384 --> 01:10:23,579
<i>There was bodies</i>
<i>stacked up like cordwood.</i>

1322
01:10:25,421 --> 01:10:29,414
<i>We judged them to be about</i>
<i>60 to 80 pounds in weight,</i>

1323
01:10:29,492 --> 01:10:32,188
<i>and people were actually dying,</i>
<i>day by day,</i>

1324
01:10:32,262 --> 01:10:34,856
<i>even after the camp</i>
<i>was liberated.</i>

1325
01:10:36,466 --> 01:10:39,663
<i>Many of the prisoners could not</i>
<i>speak English, of course,</i>

1326
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:41,795
<i>but they raised</i>
<i>their hands to us</i>

1327
01:10:41,871 --> 01:10:44,499
<i>and showed their gratitude</i>
<i>for us freeing them.</i>

1328
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:47,801
<i>This camp had about</i>
<i>20,000 survivors</i>

1329
01:10:47,877 --> 01:10:49,811
<i>at the time of liberation,</i>

1330
01:10:49,879 --> 01:10:52,313
<i>and about 8,000 of them</i>
<i>were children.</i>

1331
01:10:58,054 --> 01:11:01,217
<i>There was a section where</i>
<i>they displayed tattooed skins</i>

1332
01:11:01,291 --> 01:11:05,819
<i>which were made into lampshades</i>
<i>and book covers.</i>

1333
01:11:05,895 --> 01:11:09,922
<i>The German commandant's wife</i>
<i>would select tattooed men</i>

1334
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:13,833
<i>to be doomed to die</i>
<i>and then use their skin.</i>

1335
01:11:13,903 --> 01:11:18,363
<i>After a few days, the German</i>
<i>civilians of the town</i>

1336
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:21,274
<i>right next to Buchenwald</i>
<i>called Weimar</i>

1337
01:11:21,344 --> 01:11:25,110
<i>were paraded through</i>
<i>on a tour of the camp</i>

1338
01:11:25,181 --> 01:11:27,308
<i>to show the atrocities</i>

1339
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:30,716
<i>and to show them</i>
<i>what the Germans had done.</i>

1340
01:11:32,522 --> 01:11:37,926
<i>Many of them wouldn't even look</i>
<i>at the torture or the bodies.</i>

1341
01:11:37,994 --> 01:11:39,757
<i>Some of them were crying.</i>

1342
01:11:39,829 --> 01:11:42,559
<i>Some of them had their mouth</i>
<i>and nose covered</i>

1343
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:46,124
<i>with their handkerchiefs,</i>
<i>especially women.</i>

1344
01:11:46,202 --> 01:11:51,230
<i>So, in the filming that we did,</i>
<i>you could see this evident, uh,</i>

1345
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,241
<i>where they just</i>
<i>kept going through</i>

1346
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:54,936
because they had to.

1347
01:11:55,011 --> 01:11:57,605
They weren't too interested
in looking at the...

1348
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:00,672
<i>at the atrocities.</i>

1349
01:12:05,088 --> 01:12:08,353
<i>There was a lot of people</i>
<i>that didn't believe in this.</i>

1350
01:12:08,424 --> 01:12:10,551
<i>They didn't believe</i>
<i>that it happened.</i>

1351
01:12:10,627 --> 01:12:13,255
<i>But here we had it on film.</i>

1352
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:16,992
<i>I think in all the time</i>
<i>that I was over there,</i>

1353
01:12:17,066 --> 01:12:20,502
<i>this experience stood out</i>
<i>pretty much in my mind.</i>

1354
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:22,834
It took a while to get over it.

1355
01:12:22,906 --> 01:12:25,670
It was something
that you wouldn't want to see,

1356
01:12:25,742 --> 01:12:27,903
you wouldn't want
to go through again.

1357
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,539
<i>[Hanks] The horrors</i>
<i>of the concentration camp</i>

1358
01:12:32,615 --> 01:12:35,345
<i>had a more immediate effect</i>
<i>on Art Mainzer.</i>

1359
01:12:35,418 --> 01:12:38,546
<i>After what he had seen,</i>
<i>he yearned for normalcy.</i>

1360
01:12:39,656 --> 01:12:41,590
<i>[Mainzer]</i>
<i>I met her in Paris</i>

1361
01:12:41,658 --> 01:12:43,956
<i>the day before the</i>
<i>Battle of the Bulge started.</i>

1362
01:12:44,027 --> 01:12:46,825
<i>Believe it or not, we were</i>
<i>walking down the boulevard</i>

1363
01:12:46,896 --> 01:12:50,354
<i>and it started snowing,</i>
<i>and my buddy and I</i>

1364
01:12:50,433 --> 01:12:53,698
<i>saw these two lovely looking</i>
<i>ladies under an umbrella.</i>

1365
01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:56,830
<i>So we sneaked in</i>
<i>under the umbrella with them</i>

1366
01:12:56,906 --> 01:12:58,430
<i>and introduced ourselves.</i>

1367
01:12:58,508 --> 01:13:00,135
<i>I made the decision</i>

1368
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:02,837
<i>after I covered</i>
<i>the Buchenwald assignment.</i>

1369
01:13:02,912 --> 01:13:05,574
<i>I said, "If I ever</i>
<i>get back to France alive,</i>

1370
01:13:05,648 --> 01:13:08,708
<i>I'm going to ask Germaine</i>
<i>to marry me. "</i>

1371
01:13:08,785 --> 01:13:13,813
<i>Being a camera unit, we had</i>
<i>three 16-millimeter cameras</i>

1372
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:16,791
<i>and a couple of Speed Graphics</i>
<i>for the still photos.</i>

1373
01:13:16,859 --> 01:13:20,022
<i>We had gotten</i>
<i>some cases of champagne</i>

1374
01:13:20,096 --> 01:13:22,030
that the Germans
had looted from the French.

1375
01:13:22,098 --> 01:13:23,827
So we got it back to France.

1376
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:26,528
<i>And a lot</i>
<i>of French people showed up</i>

1377
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:29,969
<i>because in this suburb of Paris</i>

1378
01:13:30,039 --> 01:13:33,440
<i>they had not had a formal wedding</i>
<i>like this during the occupation.</i>

1379
01:13:33,509 --> 01:13:35,943
<i>It was quite an event for them.</i>

1380
01:13:36,012 --> 01:13:39,448
<i>[Hanks] It was a June wedding,</i>
<i>the month after V.E. Day.</i>

1381
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:42,609
<i>These pictures were his unit's</i>
<i>gift to the bride and groom.</i>

1382
01:13:42,685 --> 01:13:45,654
<i>The Mainzers would live their lives</i>
<i>together in the United States</i>

1383
01:13:45,722 --> 01:13:47,656
<i>until Germaine</i>
<i>passed away in 1998</i>

1384
01:13:47,724 --> 01:13:50,522
<i>after almost</i>
<i>53 years of marriage.</i>

1385
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:57,855
<i>Iwo Jima, February 1945.</i>

1386
01:13:57,934 --> 01:14:01,335
<i>As the Americans came closer</i>
<i>to the Japanese mainland,</i>

1387
01:14:01,404 --> 01:14:03,702
<i>fighting in the Pacific</i>
<i>grew still more bitter.</i>

1388
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:06,674
<i>The bombardment crumbled</i>
<i>one side of Iwo's key bastion,</i>

1389
01:14:06,742 --> 01:14:08,710
<i>Mount Suribachi.</i>

1390
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:10,905
<i>But it took five bloody days</i>
<i>for the marines</i>

1391
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:12,948
<i>to fight their way</i>
<i>to its summit.</i>

1392
01:14:13,015 --> 01:14:15,677
<i>When the marines set out</i>
<i>to place a conqueror's flag</i>

1393
01:14:15,751 --> 01:14:17,116
<i>on Suribachi,</i>

1394
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:19,518
<i>they still encountered</i>
<i>resistance.</i>

1395
01:14:19,589 --> 01:14:22,888
<i>But they persevered,</i>
<i>and the flag was raised.</i>

1396
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:25,792
<i>Unfortunately, it lacked</i>
<i>properly heroic proportions.</i>

1397
01:14:25,862 --> 01:14:28,353
<i>Something would</i>
<i>have to be done.</i>

1398
01:14:28,431 --> 01:14:30,956
<i>[Hatch] It was too small</i>
<i>to be seen by anybody.</i>

1399
01:14:31,033 --> 01:14:32,967
<i>So the commanding general down there</i>

1400
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:34,969
figured we better get a bigger flag.

1401
01:14:35,037 --> 01:14:38,063
So they got some of the LSTs
that were there,

1402
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:41,200
and one of the LST commanders said,
"When we stopped at Pearl,

1403
01:14:41,277 --> 01:14:43,802
<i>we got a big flag,</i>
<i>but we've never flown it. "</i>

1404
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:47,748
<i>My boss came to me and said,</i>
<i>"Make sure we send photographers up.</i>

1405
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:50,718
<i>This is going to be considered</i>
<i>the official flag raising. "</i>

1406
01:14:50,786 --> 01:14:53,687
<i>I said sure and got in touch</i>
<i>with Genaust and Bob Campbell.</i>

1407
01:14:53,756 --> 01:14:56,623
Bill Genaust was the movie man,
Bob Campbell the still.

1408
01:14:56,692 --> 01:14:58,751
<i>They hooked up with Rosenthal</i>
<i>going up the hill.</i>

1409
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:01,296
<i>[Hanks] That was Joe Rosenthal</i>
<i>of the Associated Press,</i>

1410
01:15:01,364 --> 01:15:05,892
<i>a civilian photographer who had taken</i>
<i>these pictures of the landing.</i>

1411
01:15:07,637 --> 01:15:10,731
<i>These are the shots Genaust</i>
<i>took on that second climb.</i>

1412
01:15:10,806 --> 01:15:13,741
<i>A few days later,</i>
<i>he would be killed in action.</i>

1413
01:15:13,809 --> 01:15:16,801
<i>He would not live to see</i>
<i>the images he made.</i>

1414
01:15:18,147 --> 01:15:19,910
<i>[Hatch]</i>
<i>People would always contest</i>

1415
01:15:19,982 --> 01:15:22,075
<i>whether or not</i>
<i>this was the first</i>

1416
01:15:22,151 --> 01:15:24,517
<i>or whether the other one</i>
<i>was the first,</i>

1417
01:15:24,587 --> 01:15:26,680
<i>but Bob Campbell</i>
<i>didn't like the position</i>

1418
01:15:26,756 --> 01:15:28,781
<i>that the other</i>
<i>two cameramen were in,</i>

1419
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:32,294
<i>so he got over to the side, and</i>
<i>he's got a beautiful picture</i>

1420
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:36,388
<i>of the first flag coming down and</i>
<i>the second going up at the same time.</i>

1421
01:15:36,465 --> 01:15:38,433
<i>[Hanks]</i>
<i>It was Rosenthal, however,</i>

1422
01:15:38,501 --> 01:15:41,402
<i>who got the immortal shot</i>
<i>and a lifetime's controversy,</i>

1423
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:43,529
<i>for he shipped</i>
<i>all his pictures back</i>

1424
01:15:43,606 --> 01:15:45,437
<i>unseen and undeveloped.</i>

1425

<i>[Hatch] Joe gets on a boat about</i>
<i>four days later and goes to Guam,</i>

01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:54,079
<i>"What was this picture?"</i>

1428
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:57,984
<i>They had seen it, but they wanted</i>
<i>to know what he thought about it.</i>

1429
01:15:58,054 --> 01:15:59,783
<i>He says, "I don't know.</i>

1430
01:15:59,855 --> 01:16:03,621
<i>Maybe it's that picture I posed</i>
<i>with the men under the flagpole</i>

1431
01:16:03,693 --> 01:16:07,094
<i>in the typical 'banzai, '</i>
<i>raising their rifles. "</i>

1432
01:16:07,163 --> 01:16:10,758
<i>And that word "posed" got into</i>
<i>the lexicon of the problem.</i>

1433
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:13,825
<i>It's hung in there for years</i>
<i>and years and years.</i>

1434
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:15,495
<i>That thing we have fought</i>

1435
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:18,233
for 50 years
to try to straighten out.

1436
01:16:18,307 --> 01:16:22,505
I thought at the end of the 50th
anniversary we had it resolved,

1437
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:25,911
but I think it'll probably
go on for another 50.

1438
01:16:25,982 --> 01:16:28,280
<i>[Hanks] The comparison</i>
<i>between the movie footage</i>

1439
01:16:28,351 --> 01:16:30,114
<i>and Rosenthal's image is definitive.</i>

1440
01:16:30,186 --> 01:16:32,711
<i>He took exactly</i>
<i>the same shot Genaust did</i>

1441
01:16:32,788 --> 01:16:34,915
<i>from virtually</i>
<i>the same position.</i>

1442
01:16:39,695 --> 01:16:41,629
<i>This controversy,</i>
<i>to some degree,</i>

1443
01:16:41,697 --> 01:16:46,031
<i>masks the real story</i>
<i>of Iwo Jima: Its cost.</i>

1444
01:16:46,102 --> 01:16:48,536
<i>Almost 7,000 marines died here,</i>

1445
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:51,767
<i>along with 21,000 Japanese.</i>

1446
01:16:51,841 --> 01:16:55,333
<i>The marines were awarded</i>
<i>27 Medals of Honor,</i>

1447
01:16:55,411 --> 01:16:57,811
<i>more than in</i>
<i>any other engagement.</i>

1448
01:17:00,082 --> 01:17:02,050
<i>Manila, spring of 1945.</i>

1449
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:04,052
<i>It was now, unquestionably,</i>

1450
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:07,453
<i>"war without mercy,"</i>
<i>as one historian called it.</i>

1451
01:17:07,523 --> 01:17:11,152
<i>The fires the Japanese set</i>
<i>destroyed 70% of the city.</i>

1452
01:17:11,227 --> 01:17:14,924
<i>They killed 100,000 civilians</i>
<i>in an orgy of destruction.</i>

1453
01:17:14,997 --> 01:17:18,194
<i>This act of vengeance</i>
<i>on an innocent population</i>

1454
01:17:18,267 --> 01:17:20,599
<i>was recorded by Don Honeyman.</i>

1455
01:17:20,670 --> 01:17:24,401
<i>[Honeyman] The next day,</i>
<i>the infantry was moving into the city,</i>

1456
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:27,840
<i>and we got some</i>
<i>very good street fighting.</i>

1457
01:17:30,946 --> 01:17:33,039
[Gunfire]

1458
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:35,242
<i>[Hanks]</i>
<i>Honeyman then joined forces</i>

1459
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:38,377
<i>surrounding the presidential</i>
<i>palace outside the city.</i>

1460
01:17:38,454 --> 01:17:41,582
<i>[Honeyman] We were leaving the palace</i>
<i>aside and going to the gardens,</i>

1461
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,648
<i>which included</i>
<i>the other side of the river.</i>

1462
01:17:43,726 --> 01:17:46,058
We had the north bank of the river,

1463
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:48,062
and they had the south bank.

1464
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:51,622
So we made a crossing
of the river in assault boats.

1465
01:17:53,936 --> 01:17:56,029
<i>I watched one wave</i>
<i>of boats go over,</i>

1466
01:17:56,105 --> 01:17:58,005
<i>and they didn't seem</i>
<i>to have trouble.</i>

1467
01:17:58,074 --> 01:18:01,441
<i>So I figured it was safe</i>
<i>to go on the second one.</i>

1468
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:03,444
<i>We got out in the middle,</i>

1469
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:05,878
<i>and the Japanese</i>
<i>began to shoot at us</i>

1470
01:18:05,948 --> 01:18:09,076
<i>from the side of the river</i>
<i>which we thought was ours,</i>

1471
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:11,642
<i>which we thought was hardly fair.</i>

1472
01:18:15,191 --> 01:18:18,319
<i>[Hanks] The Americans brought up</i>
<i>armored amphibious vehicles</i>

1473
01:18:18,394 --> 01:18:20,328
<i>to bring their troops safely to shore.</i>

1474
01:18:21,597 --> 01:18:23,827
<i>[Honeyman]</i>
<i>We came across a BAR man</i>

1475
01:18:23,899 --> 01:18:26,527
<i>who happened to be</i>
<i>down on his elbows</i>

1476
01:18:26,602 --> 01:18:30,595
<i>next to a sign saying,</i>
<i>"Please do not pick the flowers."</i>

1477
01:18:33,442 --> 01:18:35,842
<i>[Hanks] In the city,</i>
<i>fighting remained intense.</i>

1478
01:18:35,911 --> 01:18:38,505
<i>A Japanese strongpoint</i>
<i>was the legislative palace.</i>

1479
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:44,117
<i>[Honeyman] Eight-inch howitzers</i>
<i>lined up side by side,</i>

1480
01:18:44,186 --> 01:18:46,177
<i>practically firing point-blank.</i>

1481
01:18:48,124 --> 01:18:52,686
<i>Simply taking down the building</i>
<i>stone by stone, practically.</i>

1482
01:18:52,762 --> 01:18:56,630
<i>[Hanks] Despite the incredible</i>
<i>firepower leveled at them,</i>

1483
01:18:56,699 --> 01:18:59,065
<i>the Japanese hung on</i>
<i>in the ruined palace.</i>

1484
01:18:59,135 --> 01:19:02,070
<i>Infantry would have</i>
<i>to root them out.</i>

1485
01:19:02,138 --> 01:19:04,072
<i>[Honeyman]</i>
<i>Next day I went to cover</i>

1486
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:06,074
<i>the transfer</i>
<i>of civil government</i>

1487
01:19:06,142 --> 01:19:08,906
<i>from MacArthur</i>
<i>to the Filipinos.</i>

1488
01:19:08,978 --> 01:19:14,712
<i>And he said very proudly</i>
<i>how Manila was now secure.</i>

1489
01:19:14,784 --> 01:19:17,412
And I said, "All except
the legislative building."

1490
01:19:17,486 --> 01:19:19,613
<i>[Hanks]</i>
<i>Okinawa, Easter Sunday.</i>

1491
01:19:19,688 --> 01:19:22,589
<i>The idea was to stage</i>
<i>the invasion of Japan</i>

1492
01:19:22,658 --> 01:19:24,421
<i>from this large island.</i>

1493
01:19:24,493 --> 01:19:26,723
<i>Rather innocently, Lloyd Durant</i>

1494
01:19:26,796 --> 01:19:29,424
<i>decided to shoot a film</i>
<i>on combat cameramen here.</i>

1495
01:19:29,498 --> 01:19:33,662
What better subject to put on film

1496
01:19:33,736 --> 01:19:37,103
than the story
of the combat cameraman,

1497
01:19:37,173 --> 01:19:40,540
who was practically unknown
at the time.

1498
01:19:42,978 --> 01:19:46,379
<i>We knew that our next operation</i>
<i>was coming off in the Pacific.</i>

1499
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:49,781
<i>So I said,</i>
<i>"Let me go out there,</i>

1500
01:19:49,852 --> 01:19:53,788
<i>"let me find the cameramen</i>
<i>we have out there,</i>

1501
01:19:53,856 --> 01:19:57,553
<i>"and presumably they will be in on</i>
<i>the action, whatever it may be,</i>

1502
01:19:57,626 --> 01:19:59,821
<i>"and I want to be there</i>
<i>photographing them</i>

1503
01:19:59,895 --> 01:20:01,726
<i>photographing the action. "</i>

1504
01:20:03,532 --> 01:20:07,263
<i>So we hit the beach at Okinawa.</i>

1505
01:20:10,005 --> 01:20:12,405
<i>There I was,</i>
<i>working with these guys,</i>

1506
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:15,739
<i>creeping in foxholes,</i>
<i>squirming along the beach</i>

1507
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:18,575
<i>and trying to keep the sand</i>
<i>out of the camera</i>

1508
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:20,410
<i>and out of my mouth,</i>

1509
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:22,746
<i>and they're trying</i>
<i>to do the same thing.</i>

1510
01:20:24,687 --> 01:20:27,952
<i>Also, there were</i>
<i>a few bullets flying around.</i>

1511
01:20:28,023 --> 01:20:31,891
<i>[Hanks] The battle would</i>
<i>continue for three months.</i>

1512
01:20:31,961 --> 01:20:34,555
<i>Among the casualties,</i>
<i>the worst of the war,</i>

1513
01:20:34,630 --> 01:20:36,723
<i>was a cameraman.</i>

1514
01:20:36,799 --> 01:20:39,597
<i>[Honeyman]</i>
<i>He was a navy cameraman.</i>

1515
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:42,660
<i>Somehow or another,</i>
<i>he was hit and blinded.</i>

1516
01:20:42,738 --> 01:20:47,038
<i>They had bandaged, in the field,</i>
<i>his eyes, and some of it</i>

1517
01:20:47,109 --> 01:20:49,043
was still hanging down.

1518
01:20:49,111 --> 01:20:51,204
He, of course, could not see.

1519
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:55,239
<i>They brought him up on the side of</i>
<i>the ship, and he got to the top,</i>

1520
01:20:55,317 --> 01:20:57,842
and he's reaching for help.

1521
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,547
<i>He can't see a thing.</i>

1522
01:20:59,622 --> 01:21:02,318
<i>And his buddies reached up</i>
<i>and took him down.</i>

1523
01:21:02,391 --> 01:21:04,120
<i>And our commentary is,</i>

1524
01:21:04,193 --> 01:21:07,959
<i>"For this cameraman,</i>
<i>the picture was over. "</i>

1525
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:09,827
<i>And that's exactly what it was.</i>

1526
01:21:09,899 --> 01:21:12,197
<i>He never saw again.</i>

1527
01:21:15,638 --> 01:21:18,334
<i>Later that day,</i>
<i>the kamikazes came in.</i>

1528
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:20,974
<i>These were guys</i>

1529
01:21:21,043 --> 01:21:25,002
<i>who were dedicated to giving</i>
<i>their lives for their country.</i>

1530
01:21:26,749 --> 01:21:28,740
<i>And they crashed into us.</i>

1531
01:21:30,419 --> 01:21:33,752
<i>Our antiaircraft guns</i>
<i>were working at them full-time.</i>

1532
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:45,399
<i>And our other problem was</i>
<i>our own flak coming down</i>

1533
01:21:45,467 --> 01:21:47,958
<i>did as much damage</i>
<i>to many of us</i>

1534
01:21:48,037 --> 01:21:49,664
<i>as did the kamikazes,</i>

1535
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:52,298
<i>because it'd go</i>
<i>right through your helmet,</i>

1536
01:21:52,374 --> 01:21:54,467
<i>of course, if it</i>
<i>hit you directly.</i>

1537
01:21:54,543 --> 01:21:56,135
<i>[Hanks]</i>
<i>Bull Halsey said,</i>

1538
01:21:56,211 --> 01:21:59,977
<i>"The kamikazes were the only</i>
<i>weapon I feared in the war. "</i>

1539
01:22:00,049 --> 01:22:03,018
<i>There were over 1,300</i>
<i>of these suicide attacks.</i>

1540
01:22:03,085 --> 01:22:06,577
<i>They sank 26 ships</i>
<i>and damaged 300.</i>

1541
01:22:15,965 --> 01:22:18,092
<i>The photographic record</i>
<i>of these attacks</i>

1542
01:22:18,167 --> 01:22:21,102
<i>includes some of the most</i>
<i>astonishing footage of the war.</i>

1543
01:22:21,170 --> 01:22:24,503
<i>There were many near misses,</i>
<i>as this one turned out to be,</i>

1544
01:22:24,573 --> 01:22:27,098
<i>but most of the navy casualties</i>
<i>at Okinawa</i>

1545
01:22:27,176 --> 01:22:29,076
<i>are attributed to kamikazes.</i>

1546
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:42,122
<i>They damaged some carriers</i>
<i>but sunk none.</i>

1547
01:22:42,191 --> 01:22:43,453
<i>Yet they persisted.</i>

1548
01:22:43,525 --> 01:22:45,049
<i>The last kamikaze attack</i>

1549
01:22:45,127 --> 01:22:47,118
<i>was mounted</i>
<i>after the surrender.</i>

1550
01:22:49,398 --> 01:22:52,834
<i>These B-24s are over</i>
<i>Balikpapan in Borneo.</i>

1551
01:22:52,901 --> 01:22:55,028
<i>Known as</i>
<i>the Ploesti of the Pacific,</i>

1552
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:58,437
<i>the huge oil refinery was</i>
<i>bombed for 30 consecutive days</i>

<i>in the summer of 1945.</i>

1554

<i>They were softening it up</i>
<i>for what would be</i>

<i>the last amphibious landing</i>
<i>of World War II.</i>

1556
01:23:10,019 --> 01:23:12,647
<i>The American Coast Guard</i>
<i>took Australian troops ashore.</i>

1557
01:23:12,721 --> 01:23:14,348
<i>Jerry Anker was there</i>

1558

<i>with his buddy Jim Lonergan,</i>
<i>also a cameraman.</i>

1559
01:23:17,626 --> 01:23:20,117
<i>He wanted a picture</i>
<i>of himself in action.</i>

1560
01:23:20,195 --> 01:23:22,060
<i>Anker obliged with a snap</i>

1561
01:23:22,131 --> 01:23:24,895
<i>that became famous</i>
<i>in the photo histories.</i>

1562

<i>When the landing craft</i>
<i>hit the beach</i>

1563
01:23:27,036 --> 01:23:28,799
at Balikpapan, I said,

1564
01:23:28,871 --> 01:23:32,204
"Oh, my God, that idiot!"
And pulled up my four-by-five

1565
01:23:32,274 --> 01:23:34,208
<i>and shot the picture of him,</i>

1566
01:23:34,276 --> 01:23:36,267
<i>and I only took</i>
<i>one picture of it,</i>

1567
01:23:36,345 --> 01:23:39,007
<i>and it turned out</i>
<i>to be a prizewinner.</i>

1568
01:23:42,284 --> 01:23:45,117
<i>Here, in the war's waning days,</i>
<i>Anker was presented</i>

1569
01:23:45,187 --> 01:23:47,951
<i>with another more terrible</i>
<i>photo opportunity.</i>

1570
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:49,615
<i>[Anker]</i>
<i>I had been following</i>

1571
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:51,989
<i>this Australian infantryman</i>
<i>with a flamethrower</i>

1572
01:23:52,061 --> 01:23:56,054
<i>around, I guess,</i>
<i>for probably a half hour,</i>

1573
01:23:56,131 --> 01:23:59,191
<i>and it just so happened</i>
<i>that when he shot</i>

1574
01:23:59,268 --> 01:24:02,237
<i>this flamethrower</i>
<i>into this cave,</i>

1575
01:24:02,304 --> 01:24:06,263
<i>this Japanese soldier</i>
<i>came running out in flames,</i>

1576
01:24:06,341 --> 01:24:09,367
<i>and I was able to photograph</i>
<i>the entire sequence.</i>

1577
01:24:09,445 --> 01:24:11,037
<i>To this day,</i>

1578
01:24:11,113 --> 01:24:15,846
<i>I can still smell the stench</i>
<i>of that burning body.</i>

1579
01:24:15,918 --> 01:24:18,352
That one anonymous soldier,
dying in agony,

1580
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:21,753
vividly symbolizes
the waste of war.

1581
01:24:21,824 --> 01:24:24,088
Multiply his fate 100,000 times

1582
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:27,390
and you begin to comprehend
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

1583
01:24:27,463 --> 01:24:29,397
But not entirely,

1584
01:24:29,465 --> 01:24:32,662
for as many people died later
of radiation poisoning

1585
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:34,668
as died in the initial blasts.

1586
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:37,796
We are told these lives
were traded for the many more

1587
01:24:37,873 --> 01:24:40,137
that would have been lost
on both sides

1588
01:24:40,209 --> 01:24:41,801
in an invasion of Japan.

1589
01:24:41,877 --> 01:24:43,970
But all we know for sure is

1590
01:24:44,046 --> 01:24:47,209
that the atomic bombs brought
the war to an abrupt end

1591
01:24:47,282 --> 01:24:49,580
and finally stopped
all the killing

1592
01:24:49,651 --> 01:24:51,642
at over 40 million.

1593
01:24:55,557 --> 01:24:58,549
<i>[Hanks] At Nagasaki,</i>
<i>as at the concentration camps,</i>

1594
01:24:58,627 --> 01:25:02,586
<i>the combat photographers</i>
<i>had one last service to render.</i>

1595
01:25:02,664 --> 01:25:04,632
<i>Dan McGovern</i>
<i>speaks for all those</i>

1596
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:06,634
<i>who entered this charnel house.</i>

1597
01:25:06,702 --> 01:25:09,170
My effort was...

1598
01:25:09,237 --> 01:25:11,228
to show the world

1599
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:15,874
<i>what the atomic bomb</i>
<i>had done to a nation.</i>

1600
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:18,310
<i>What it had done</i>
<i>to human beings.</i>

1601
01:25:20,849 --> 01:25:23,443
<i>The Sorayama School</i>
<i>in Nagasaki...</i>

1602
01:25:23,518 --> 01:25:27,818
<i>Sucked out hundreds of kids</i>
<i>through the windows.</i>

1603
01:25:27,889 --> 01:25:31,017
I remember one particular scene
that I shot,

1604
01:25:31,093 --> 01:25:32,993
and I couldn't figure out

1605
01:25:33,061 --> 01:25:36,189
what was wrong
with this particular person.

1606
01:25:36,264 --> 01:25:38,232
<i>He reminded me of a monk,</i>

1607
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:40,291
<i>orjust a priest</i>
<i>with his staff,</i>

1608
01:25:40,368 --> 01:25:42,632
<i>and he was standing</i>
<i>up on a rise</i>

1609
01:25:42,704 --> 01:25:47,004
<i>looking over the hill of Nagasaki</i>
<i>from the Urakami Valley.</i>

1610
01:25:47,075 --> 01:25:51,478
<i>He was a radiologist from</i>
<i>the Nagasaki teaching hospital,</i>

1611
01:25:51,546 --> 01:25:53,707
<i>which was just</i>
<i>down below the hill.</i>

1612
01:25:53,782 --> 01:25:56,876
<i>He told me then</i>
<i>that he had lost his wife,</i>

1613
01:25:56,952 --> 01:25:59,216
<i>that he was suffering</i>
<i>from radiation sickness.</i>

1614
01:26:00,489 --> 01:26:02,855
<i>Two days later, he was gone.</i>

1615
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:07,758
<i>[Hanks] Where people were sitting</i>
<i>when the bomb exploded,</i>

1616
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:09,820
<i>permanent shadows were burned.</i>

1617
01:26:13,401 --> 01:26:15,699
<i>It was the same way</i>
<i>with things.</i>

1618
01:26:15,771 --> 01:26:19,138
<i>You can paint over the shadows,</i>
<i>but you cannot erase them.</i>

1619
01:26:21,309 --> 01:26:23,300
<i>[McGovern]</i>
<i>That was my effort.</i>

1620
01:26:24,446 --> 01:26:27,040
<i>Thought because</i>
<i>we showed the...</i>

1621
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:30,375
<i>burned bodies of children,</i>

1622
01:26:30,452 --> 01:26:32,852
<i>people would cry out,</i>

1623
01:26:33,989 --> 01:26:36,321
<i>"Let's not do this again."</i>

1624
01:26:40,162 --> 01:26:42,130
<i>[Hanks]</i>
<i>Yet we do.</i>

1625
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:44,563
<i>These pictures have been</i>
<i>duplicated in every war</i>

1626
01:26:44,633 --> 01:26:47,067
<i>for over a half century.</i>

1627
01:26:47,135 --> 01:26:50,161
<i>The children reach out to us</i>
<i>in their abandonment,</i>

1628
01:26:50,238 --> 01:26:52,604
<i>their incomprehensible</i>
<i>loneliness.</i>

1629
01:26:52,674 --> 01:26:56,132
<i>The soldiers</i>
<i>offer what comfort they can.</i>

1630
01:26:56,211 --> 01:27:00,011
<i>These men and these children</i>
<i>share the terrible bond of war.</i>

1631
01:27:01,349 --> 01:27:04,216
<i>But the soldiers</i>
<i>will soon move on.</i>

1632
01:27:04,286 --> 01:27:06,584
<i>They will not know the fates</i>
<i>of these orphans</i>

1633
01:27:06,655 --> 01:27:09,920
<i>with whom they shared</i>
<i>their humanity for a moment.</i>

1634
01:27:09,991 --> 01:27:13,620
<i>These picture ought to assure</i>
<i>centuries of peace.</i>

1635
01:27:13,695 --> 01:27:15,686
<i>They do not.</i>

1636
01:27:17,032 --> 01:27:19,796
<i>But it may be that</i>
<i>after the shooting stops,</i>

1637
01:27:19,868 --> 01:27:23,099
<i>the combat cameramen</i>
<i>achieve their finest hour.</i>
