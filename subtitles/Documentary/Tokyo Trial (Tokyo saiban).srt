1
00:00:05,918 --> 00:00:08,048
All because of us...

2
00:00:08,249 --> 00:00:11,345
It doesn't even concern you.

3
00:00:17,324 --> 00:00:18,823
It does concern me.

4
00:00:21,948 --> 00:00:24,449
Don't say that it doesn't.

5
00:00:27,198 --> 00:00:28,615
You should...

6
00:00:30,741 --> 00:00:31,948
leave him.

7
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:38,822
You're jealous.

8
00:00:40,823 --> 00:00:43,906
Jealous? Me?

9
00:00:44,157 --> 00:00:48,450
You don't love me anymore, do you?

10
00:00:49,575 --> 00:00:51,365
That's not it...

11
00:00:51,865 --> 00:00:54,450
You never loved me!

12
00:00:54,575 --> 00:00:57,700
- Calm down!
- No! Why...

13
00:00:58,325 --> 00:00:59,575
Why...

14
00:01:00,865 --> 00:01:03,906
Why did you marry me?

15
00:01:07,365 --> 00:01:12,822
I'm the only one... that loves you.

16
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,325
I can't do this!

17
00:01:16,073 --> 00:01:17,325
Kotoko!

18
00:01:24,575 --> 00:01:27,823
<i>Something I was always
too scared to ask him about.</i>

19
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:33,948
<i>But the question was always in my heart,
and I finally let it come out.</i>

20
00:01:37,822 --> 00:01:40,948
<i>I put an end to it myself...</i>

21
00:01:49,782 --> 00:01:54,325
<i>Are we... finished?</i>

22
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,115
Another busy day.

23
00:02:06,822 --> 00:02:08,865
Sorry, we're closed.

24
00:02:10,325 --> 00:02:11,532
Kotoko?

25
00:02:16,115 --> 00:02:18,741
- What's wrong, Kotoko?
- Kotoko!

26
00:02:19,822 --> 00:02:21,032
Hey, hey...

27
00:02:21,822 --> 00:02:23,325
Are you okay?

28
00:02:25,407 --> 00:02:27,365
Have some tea, eh?

29
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:31,948
Are you fighting with Naoki again?

30
00:02:34,198 --> 00:02:38,240
I told him he'd better not
make you cry anymore.

31
00:02:38,365 --> 00:02:41,822
How pitiful.
You're going home with me.

32
00:02:42,073 --> 00:02:43,693
No, I'm not!

33
00:02:43,693 --> 00:02:46,039
Naoki will be worried.

34
00:02:46,325 --> 00:02:51,990
He doesn't care
what I do or how I do it.

35
00:02:53,532 --> 00:02:56,325
I don't know what happened,
but it's late.

36
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,407
Please!
Don't tell him I'm here.

37
00:03:00,407 --> 00:03:01,700
I...

38
00:03:02,407 --> 00:03:04,198
can't go home.

39
00:03:12,822 --> 00:03:16,948
Kotoko! Come stay with me.

40
00:03:17,325 --> 00:03:19,615
- Really?
- Yes, of course!

41
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,823
Or my apartment.
Stay as long as you like.

42
00:03:23,365 --> 00:03:24,615
Kinnosuke!

43
00:03:24,741 --> 00:03:27,823
Hello? Kotoko is here.

44
00:03:28,407 --> 00:03:30,073
Don't worry. It'll be fine.

45
00:03:30,822 --> 00:03:32,948
<i>She's going to stay
with Chris tonight.</i>

46
00:03:33,822 --> 00:03:37,407
Give her time.
She'll calm down.

47
00:03:37,822 --> 00:03:39,615
Sorry to worry you.

48
00:03:40,157 --> 00:03:41,741
Thank you.

49
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:42,822
See you.

<i>Episode 07
[A Vow with A Nurse Cap]</i>

52
00:06:16,803 --> 00:06:18,343
Aren't you eating?

53
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,971
Not right now...

54
00:06:21,096 --> 00:06:22,637
Are you okay?

55
00:06:23,971 --> 00:06:28,137
She had a fight with Mr. Irie,
ran away, and got smashed.

56
00:06:28,303 --> 00:06:31,595
Poor Kotoko!

57
00:06:33,343 --> 00:06:38,053
Girls with hangovers are so unseemly.

58
00:06:40,762 --> 00:06:41,928
Here!

59
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,343
Keita.

60
00:06:48,595 --> 00:06:52,221
This works the quickest.
Drink it.

61
00:06:52,428 --> 00:06:53,637
Thanks.

62
00:06:53,803 --> 00:06:54,971
Hey, Chris!

63
00:06:56,512 --> 00:06:57,762
I can't see!

64
00:06:58,263 --> 00:06:59,887
What are you doing?

65
00:07:00,012 --> 00:07:01,846
It's him! Him!

66
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:05,637
You're so sweet to Kotoko.

67
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,303
It's bitter!

68
00:07:12,345 --> 00:07:14,595
Did you really run away?

69
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,720
Huh?

70
00:07:16,096 --> 00:07:17,553
We can hear everything in here.

71
00:07:17,678 --> 00:07:20,178
Lecture her for me, will you?

72
00:07:21,512 --> 00:07:23,428
You fought with Irie, right?

73
00:07:29,178 --> 00:07:30,343
Want to stay with me?

74
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,012
Huh?

75
00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:35,971
It's a small apartment.

76
00:07:38,387 --> 00:07:41,637
Wait a minute.
Are you kidding?

77
00:07:43,137 --> 00:07:45,345
I told you I was serious.

78
00:07:49,096 --> 00:07:50,971
I love you.

79
00:07:53,096 --> 00:07:56,345
That idiot! What is he...

80
00:08:02,178 --> 00:08:05,343
Where are you going?
Kinnosuke!

81
00:08:08,678 --> 00:08:11,053
I can't keep my mind off of you.

82
00:08:11,178 --> 00:08:13,846
But... I'm Naoki's...

83
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:15,387
So leave him!

84
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,762
Has he come running after you?

85
00:08:19,887 --> 00:08:21,512
He's not even jealous.

86
00:08:21,637 --> 00:08:23,762
What has he done for you?

87
00:08:25,553 --> 00:08:27,303
That's not a marriage.

88
00:08:27,512 --> 00:08:30,846
Married couples need each other!

89
00:08:30,971 --> 00:08:33,179
You need me.

90
00:08:35,137 --> 00:08:36,344
Wrong.

91
00:08:40,846 --> 00:08:42,804
Totally wrong.

92
00:08:43,344 --> 00:08:44,971
Naoki...

93
00:08:46,137 --> 00:08:49,512
You're too late.
You only made Kotoko suffer.

94
00:08:50,344 --> 00:08:52,512
You can't make her happy.

95
00:08:53,804 --> 00:08:56,344
You had no right to marry her!

96
00:08:56,512 --> 00:08:57,762
What's going on?

97
00:08:57,887 --> 00:09:00,846
Kamogari and Kotoko?
An affair?

98
00:09:01,345 --> 00:09:04,679
That may have been true.

99
00:09:05,262 --> 00:09:07,344
Not "may have been"...

100
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:09,345
It was true!

101
00:09:11,846 --> 00:09:13,221
I was jealous.

102
00:09:16,637 --> 00:09:20,221
I was jealous of you.

103
00:09:21,054 --> 00:09:22,160
Huh?

104
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:29,012
I've never been jealous or envious...

105
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:34,054
I've never been dejected or
experienced any of those

106
00:09:34,344 --> 00:09:37,512
disgraceful, messy
human emotions before.

107
00:09:39,344 --> 00:09:40,344
But...

108
00:09:41,345 --> 00:09:44,344
that all changed when
Kotoko came into my life.

109
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:51,804
All those hidden emotions
made me lose control.

110
00:09:52,344 --> 00:09:56,137
I didn't know how to handle it.

111
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,344
They bewildered and irritated me.

112
00:10:03,344 --> 00:10:04,846
So what?

113
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:08,427
Kamogari, you have
more than your share

114
00:10:08,554 --> 00:10:12,344
of messy, disgraceful emotions.

115
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:15,054
What? Are you picking a fight?

116
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:17,427
I was paying you a compliment.

117
00:10:18,096 --> 00:10:20,929
I don't envy you, though.

118
00:10:24,262 --> 00:10:28,096
That's why you don't need Kotoko.

119
00:10:29,344 --> 00:10:31,344
She's for me. I need her.

120
00:10:32,762 --> 00:10:34,012
What?

121
00:10:34,595 --> 00:10:37,262
I can only be my true self

122
00:10:38,344 --> 00:10:40,470
when I'm with Kotoko.

123
00:10:46,887 --> 00:10:49,221
Really? Naoki.

124
00:10:49,971 --> 00:10:51,012
Yes.

125
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,427
I didn't even realize it until...

126
00:10:55,427 --> 00:10:57,344
Kinnosuke told me.

127
00:10:57,971 --> 00:10:59,344
Kin-chan?

128
00:11:00,344 --> 00:11:03,344
He came running over to get me.

129
00:11:03,637 --> 00:11:07,427
I can't believe...
he felt this way for 6 years.

130
00:11:08,344 --> 00:11:10,637
He's amazing.

131
00:11:11,344 --> 00:11:13,679
I'm just a better human being.

132
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,804
Naoki...

133
00:11:20,344 --> 00:11:21,470
Is it...

134
00:11:23,387 --> 00:11:24,637
Is it...

135
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,595
Is it really okay for me to stay?

136
00:11:31,971 --> 00:11:35,137
I just told you so.

137
00:11:43,344 --> 00:11:45,595
I'll never...

138
00:11:46,387 --> 00:11:49,344
leave you until the day I die!

139
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:52,804
I'm counting on it.

140
00:12:05,512 --> 00:12:08,387
- Congrats!
- How romantic!

141
00:12:08,554 --> 00:12:11,179
Oops... we're in the cafeteria!

142
00:12:12,012 --> 00:12:16,344
I guess I lack modesty, too.

143
00:12:17,344 --> 00:12:19,012
You...

144
00:12:21,304 --> 00:12:22,512
How sweet.

145
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,344
What, Motoki!

146
00:12:45,137 --> 00:12:46,720
What have you done?

147
00:12:47,345 --> 00:12:50,387
You just strengthened
their marital bond.

148
00:12:55,427 --> 00:12:57,221
Just for now...

149
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,096
You...

150
00:13:04,304 --> 00:13:06,387
love rescuing people in need.

151
00:13:07,762 --> 00:13:09,304
That's what it was.

152
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:14,344
You wanted to rescue Kotoko...
Right, Keita?

153
00:13:17,344 --> 00:13:19,387
That's one way to look at it.

154
00:13:20,344 --> 00:13:23,344
There will be plenty of patients

155
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:25,470
for you to rescue.

156
00:13:25,595 --> 00:13:27,804
Don't focus on just one.

157
00:13:28,344 --> 00:13:32,179
I'm not giving up on
Mr. Irie, though.

158
00:13:42,637 --> 00:13:44,512
We're home!

159
00:13:45,344 --> 00:13:48,262
You're home, Kotoko!

160
00:13:48,344 --> 00:13:50,637
Oh... my!

161
00:13:54,096 --> 00:13:58,344
What happened?
You made up?

162
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:02,096
Sorry to worry you, Mother.

163
00:14:02,221 --> 00:14:03,846
But we made up.

164
00:14:05,054 --> 00:14:06,345
Oh...

165
00:14:07,344 --> 00:14:09,887
I'm so glad.

166
00:14:14,804 --> 00:14:17,554
Stop hanging on me.

167
00:14:21,554 --> 00:14:22,554
Come on.

168
00:14:24,762 --> 00:14:26,387
So what happened?

169
00:14:27,804 --> 00:14:32,762
In front of everyone... Naoki...

170
00:14:34,344 --> 00:14:37,554
professed his love for me!

171
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,971
Naoki! You come through
when it counts!

172
00:14:42,096 --> 00:14:43,846
You! You! You!

173
00:14:43,971 --> 00:14:45,453
You did?!

174
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:54,344
"I can only be my true self
when I'm with Kotoko."

175
00:14:55,344 --> 00:14:56,637
- Yes!
- Hey!

176
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:59,344
What a great line!

177
00:14:59,427 --> 00:15:02,427
He loves you so much!

178
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:09,846
Now that you made up,
you'll be a real husband and wife!

179
00:15:11,137 --> 00:15:13,879
Thank you, Kotoko.

180
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,275
Huh?

181
00:15:15,971 --> 00:15:20,929
Naoki has matured so much
since he's been with you.

182
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:24,887
He understands how other
people feel.

183
00:15:25,262 --> 00:15:29,679
I think your love melted

184
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:32,679
his cold, icy heart.

185
00:15:33,137 --> 00:15:36,595
My love? Well...

186
00:15:40,804 --> 00:15:44,344
Don't ever give up on him.

187
00:15:46,887 --> 00:15:49,344
No. Of course not.

188
00:15:50,595 --> 00:15:55,720
We have to celebrate
your getting back together.

189
00:15:56,262 --> 00:15:58,344
Let's! What should we do?

190
00:15:58,344 --> 00:16:01,344
- Shall we bake a cake?
- Yes! I'll help you.

191
00:16:12,456 --> 00:16:13,703
Ms. Irie.

192
00:16:14,497 --> 00:16:18,372
You failed the injection,
vital sign checks

193
00:16:18,497 --> 00:16:20,703
and wheelchair exercises.

194
00:16:21,704 --> 00:16:24,456
It's not looking very good.

195
00:16:24,703 --> 00:16:27,703
Training at the hospital
begins next month.

196
00:16:28,372 --> 00:16:29,413
Yes...

197
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:33,413
I'll retest you tomorrow.

198
00:16:34,163 --> 00:16:38,622
If you don't pass,
you'll have to repeat a year.

199
00:16:38,703 --> 00:16:39,913
Okay?

200
00:16:42,288 --> 00:16:44,872
Oh, no!

201
00:16:45,787 --> 00:16:49,704
<i>[The Next Day]</i>

202
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,455
Kokoto!

203
00:17:16,163 --> 00:17:18,079
What are you doing here?

204
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,703
Oh... Keita.

205
00:17:21,288 --> 00:17:24,371
I'm being retested today...

206
00:17:24,622 --> 00:17:28,538
A spot check on everything
we've learned.

207
00:17:29,163 --> 00:17:34,455
I've been practicing since 6 am,
but I still can't do it.

208
00:17:39,371 --> 00:17:42,330
You wasted so many syringes.

209
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:47,703
I can't do anything right.

210
00:17:47,829 --> 00:17:50,538
No even an injection...

211
00:17:52,954 --> 00:17:57,913
I don't even know if
I can become a nurse.

212
00:17:58,371 --> 00:17:59,703
And...

213
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:07,121
This is no time for blubbering.

214
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:09,497
Huh?

215
00:18:15,704 --> 00:18:18,371
Here. Use my arm.

216
00:18:18,703 --> 00:18:21,703
It's easy, once you get the
hang of it.

217
00:18:21,954 --> 00:18:25,580
Don't worry about messing up.
Just go for it.

218
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:28,413
Really?

219
00:18:28,703 --> 00:18:29,703
Yeah.

220
00:18:32,288 --> 00:18:33,288
Okay...

221
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,455
Here I go.

222
00:18:37,663 --> 00:18:38,703
Hey!

223
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:42,871
Use the rubber arm!

224
00:18:46,455 --> 00:18:47,455
Sorry...

225
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,703
I'll get it this time.

226
00:18:58,703 --> 00:19:00,538
Look at the needle.

227
00:19:01,205 --> 00:19:02,624
Yes.

228
00:19:07,496 --> 00:19:10,163
Kotoko, relax!

229
00:19:10,829 --> 00:19:14,622
You're always telling me that.

230
00:19:14,703 --> 00:19:18,455
Your anxiety will only make
the patient nervous.

231
00:19:19,703 --> 00:19:21,038
Relax!

232
00:19:29,703 --> 00:19:32,496
Okay, one more time!

233
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,330
Okay.

234
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:46,703
I did it! I did it!

235
00:19:46,787 --> 00:19:48,703
You did it, Kotoko!

236
00:19:48,746 --> 00:19:52,413
I finally did it! Thanks, Keita!

237
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:56,528
And while we're at it...

238
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,664
can I ask you one more favor?

239
00:19:59,996 --> 00:20:01,306
Huh?

240
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,413
Kotoko, you're too tense.

241
00:20:09,538 --> 00:20:10,538
Okay...

242
00:20:10,787 --> 00:20:12,237
Take your time.

243
00:20:12,237 --> 00:20:13,250
Yes.

244
00:20:17,871 --> 00:20:20,703
Hey! Focus!

245
00:20:21,746 --> 00:20:22,746
Yes.

246
00:20:30,371 --> 00:20:31,703
Don't panic.

247
00:20:32,703 --> 00:20:34,038
- Gentle and slow.
- Okay.

248
00:20:34,163 --> 00:20:35,703
You got it...

249
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,703
I did it! Yes!

250
00:20:50,704 --> 00:20:52,246
Congratulations.

251
00:20:52,371 --> 00:20:54,703
It's all thanks to you.

252
00:20:54,704 --> 00:20:57,538
I'll never forget this feeling!

253
00:21:02,163 --> 00:21:06,703
Why do you want to become a nurse?

254
00:21:07,371 --> 00:21:10,663
You know...
was it a childhood dream?

255
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:12,622
Do you want to help the sick?

256
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:14,760
Well...

257
00:21:15,622 --> 00:21:17,205
I...

258
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:21,121
want to help Naoki because
he's going to be a doctor.

259
00:21:21,703 --> 00:21:23,079
Is that all?

260
00:21:23,746 --> 00:21:25,121
No...

261
00:21:25,288 --> 00:21:28,871
I'm a klutz and I'm not
good at anything.

262
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,246
I'm a burden to you all.

263
00:21:31,371 --> 00:21:34,580
But if I could be of help
to someone

264
00:21:34,703 --> 00:21:39,038
like provide moral support
to a patient feeling scared...

265
00:21:40,455 --> 00:21:44,703
But, Naoki still comes first.

266
00:21:50,121 --> 00:21:52,703
You're incredible.

267
00:21:57,413 --> 00:21:59,163
I guess you're happy with him.

268
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,580
Yes.

269
00:22:07,913 --> 00:22:09,703
Good luck on your test.

270
00:22:15,703 --> 00:22:17,913
Thanks... Keita.

271
00:22:26,705 --> 00:22:28,077
Hey!

272
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,705
What are you doing here so early?

273
00:22:33,371 --> 00:22:37,913
I was being a pin cushion
for your wife.

274
00:22:38,038 --> 00:22:39,955
She's being retested today.

275
00:22:40,246 --> 00:22:44,621
Well, thanks for your help.

276
00:22:45,203 --> 00:22:47,579
You're something else.

277
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:55,454
I decided not to pursue
Kotoko anymore.

278
00:22:57,746 --> 00:23:01,080
No matter how terrible
a husband you are.

279
00:23:06,287 --> 00:23:08,204
As long as Kotoko is happy...

280
00:23:09,705 --> 00:23:11,371
I'll keep my mouth shut.

281
00:24:11,203 --> 00:24:15,996
So you accepted the fact
that you can't compete

282
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:19,746
with her strong feelings for me.

283
00:24:22,038 --> 00:24:25,001
Too bad it took you so long.

284
00:24:25,329 --> 00:24:29,876
Is this how you treat a guy
who just conceded?

285
00:24:30,663 --> 00:24:32,788
You conceited jerk!

286
00:24:37,203 --> 00:24:39,080
Take care of her.

287
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,959
What's this?

288
00:25:02,106 --> 00:25:06,106
A special omelet. I told
Kin-chan I passed the test.

289
00:25:06,107 --> 00:25:09,150
Now we can all train together!

290
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:10,275
Yes!

291
00:25:11,316 --> 00:25:12,983
But before that...

292
00:25:14,983 --> 00:25:16,232
It's almost here.

293
00:25:16,357 --> 00:25:17,573
What is?

294
00:25:18,691 --> 00:25:21,775
The capping ceremony, of course.

295
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,608
What's a capping ceremony?

296
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:26,316
What?

297
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:30,106
You've never hear of
the capping ceremony?

298
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:32,316
I transferred mid-term.

299
00:25:32,441 --> 00:25:37,106
So what?
A capping ceremony is...

300
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:41,983
the first step in becoming
a real nurse.

301
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:44,691
Like a coming-of-age ceremony
for nurses.

302
00:25:45,106 --> 00:25:46,275
I see.

303
00:25:46,482 --> 00:25:49,733
We get "capped" by the head nurse.

304
00:25:49,983 --> 00:25:53,232
Holding candles! How romantic.

305
00:25:53,357 --> 00:25:57,400
I've dreamt of this day for
so long...

306
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,441
My own nurse's cap...

307
00:26:00,106 --> 00:26:03,983
My first step towards
becoming a "nightingale".

308
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,190
It's not an exaggeration...

309
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:10,106
to say I chose this path just
for this auspicious event!

310
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:13,106
Is it that great?

311
00:26:13,106 --> 00:26:15,566
And there's something else.

312
00:26:16,106 --> 00:26:17,236
What?

313
00:26:17,236 --> 00:26:21,650
A guy from the medical school
presents you with flowers!

314
00:26:21,775 --> 00:26:23,150
- Flowers?
- Yes!

315
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:27,106
It's a tradition unique
to Tonan University.

316
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:31,941
When we finish the ceremony,
a med student is waiting for you

317
00:26:32,066 --> 00:26:35,106
with a bouquet of flowers!

318
00:26:35,232 --> 00:26:39,858
A once in a lifetime event.
Everyone is...

319
00:26:39,983 --> 00:26:43,941
desperately looking for someone
to give them a bouquet.

320
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:50,150
I'm so lucky!

321
00:26:52,232 --> 00:26:53,316
Kotoko!

322
00:26:56,066 --> 00:26:57,066
Congratulations.

323
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:02,025
The cap looks good on you.

324
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,232
I love you.

325
00:27:05,816 --> 00:27:07,107
Naoki...

326
00:27:09,357 --> 00:27:11,482
<i>Just imagining it--</i>

327
00:27:11,608 --> 00:27:16,275
<i>it's too wonderful to be true!</i>

328
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,811
<i>I'm getting a bouquet from Naoki.</i>

329
00:27:25,525 --> 00:27:28,275
It's no use.
She's in dreamland.

330
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:31,775
Who should I ask?

331
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,900
What about Mr. Funatsu?
He'd be happy to.

332
00:27:35,025 --> 00:27:36,691
Are you kidding me?

333
00:27:36,816 --> 00:27:40,106
I haven't seen Mr. Funatsu lately.

334
00:27:40,106 --> 00:27:43,106
The parasite museum
was closed yesterday...

335
00:27:43,106 --> 00:27:45,106
Speak of the devil...

336
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,482
Mr. Irie?

337
00:27:46,941 --> 00:27:49,275
Are you listening? Mr. Irie?

338
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,482
You complain too much.

339
00:27:52,608 --> 00:27:54,066
Mr. Irie!

340
00:27:55,357 --> 00:27:57,106
Naoki!

341
00:28:08,106 --> 00:28:09,733
I don't feel well.

342
00:28:16,733 --> 00:28:19,441
Naoki! Where's Mr. Funatsu?

343
00:28:19,566 --> 00:28:21,525
He's not feeling well.

344
00:28:21,941 --> 00:28:23,107
He's lying.

345
00:28:24,106 --> 00:28:25,275
What?

346
00:28:26,316 --> 00:28:31,106
You were number one again,
weren't you?

347
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:32,190
Yeah.

348
00:28:32,816 --> 00:28:36,357
You said you bombed the test,
but you still...

349
00:28:37,106 --> 00:28:39,775
My husband is amazing.

350
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,106
What are you doing?

351
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,441
I knew it...

352
00:28:43,608 --> 00:28:44,983
Mr. Funatsu...

353
00:28:45,106 --> 00:28:48,316
He talked all big, but he's
still number two.

354
00:28:48,441 --> 00:28:52,400
That's why he can't face me.
What a coward!

355
00:28:53,983 --> 00:28:55,983
Is he a man or what?

356
00:28:57,441 --> 00:29:01,106
Naoki, I have a favor to ask...

357
00:29:01,816 --> 00:29:05,775
The capping ceremony is coming up.

358
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:10,441
There's a tradition of
giving flowers to the nurses...

359
00:29:10,566 --> 00:29:13,941
I'm so happy... Oh!

360
00:29:14,066 --> 00:29:17,106
I'll appreciate anything,
but I prefer roses...

361
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:19,275
- I can't.
- Huh?

362
00:29:19,566 --> 00:29:24,858
I'll be at a conference in Nagoya
with my professor.

363
00:29:25,316 --> 00:29:27,482
What?!

364
00:29:28,357 --> 00:29:31,025
But... but!

365
00:29:31,106 --> 00:29:33,441
We'll probably stay overnight.

366
00:29:33,566 --> 00:29:35,941
In any case

367
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:39,816
I have no interest in participating
in such an embarrassing tradition.

368
00:29:40,816 --> 00:29:42,106
It's ridiculous.

369
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,357
See you.

370
00:29:44,941 --> 00:29:47,106
So mean!

371
00:29:47,106 --> 00:29:51,566
Mr. Irie was so popular last year...

372
00:29:51,691 --> 00:29:57,858
so many of the nurses asked him,
but he rejected them all, so...

373
00:29:58,066 --> 00:29:59,150
So?

374
00:30:04,181 --> 00:30:07,683
Everyone, the capping ceremony
is just around the corner.

375
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:10,557
Today, I've asked the head nurse

376
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:13,307
of Tonan University Hospital
to say a few words.

377
00:30:14,391 --> 00:30:18,099
I'm Nurse Hosoi.
Nice to meet you.

378
00:30:20,016 --> 00:30:21,974
What presence!

379
00:30:22,181 --> 00:30:25,391
She's famous for her "big presence".

380
00:30:25,516 --> 00:30:28,432
She's also known for picking on
nurses she doesn't like.

381
00:30:28,557 --> 00:30:32,391
I hope I'm never on her black list.

382
00:30:32,724 --> 00:30:36,181
I heard there's a Mrs. Irie
in this class.

383
00:30:36,181 --> 00:30:40,181
Yes. I'm Kotoko Irie.

384
00:30:40,181 --> 00:30:42,683
You're Mrs. Irie?

385
00:30:44,058 --> 00:30:48,099
Your husband is an intern
at our hospital.

386
00:30:48,182 --> 00:30:52,349
He's so capable!
He's the talk of the ward.

387
00:30:52,474 --> 00:30:56,933
I expect you to be just
as capable.

388
00:30:57,182 --> 00:30:59,474
Well... I...

389
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:01,599
Yes, she is.

390
00:31:01,724 --> 00:31:06,182
Oh, how promising!

391
00:31:06,307 --> 00:31:08,181
Let's get down to business.

392
00:31:09,141 --> 00:31:10,516
At the upcoming ceremony

393
00:31:10,641 --> 00:31:13,969
I'd like 4 of you to recite
the "Nightingale Pledge."

394
00:31:13,969 --> 00:31:15,181
Me! Me! Me!

395
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:16,817
Yes?

396
00:31:19,307 --> 00:31:23,264
My name is Motoki Kikyo.
May I volunteer?

397
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:28,432
Are you a man?

398
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:30,307
You cannot!

399
00:31:30,641 --> 00:31:34,016
Why? Nurse Hosoi!

400
00:31:34,808 --> 00:31:37,307
At Tonan, the Nightingale Pledge

401
00:31:37,432 --> 00:31:40,016
has always been recited
by female students.

402
00:31:40,141 --> 00:31:43,181
Unfortunately, I have no use for you.

403
00:31:45,349 --> 00:31:48,766
Furthermore, male students
don't get capped.

404
00:31:48,891 --> 00:31:51,516
They get a badge.

405
00:31:53,808 --> 00:31:56,766
My... dream...

406
00:31:58,641 --> 00:32:02,391
I lived for this day...

407
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:08,181
I choose Miss Ogura.

408
00:32:08,224 --> 00:32:09,560
Yes.

409
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,181
- Miss Mori.
- Yes.

410
00:32:11,516 --> 00:32:13,724
- Miss Shinagawa.
- Yes.

411
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:17,557
And lastly, Mrs. Kotoko Irie.

412
00:32:17,683 --> 00:32:18,683
Huh?

413
00:32:19,181 --> 00:32:21,181
I'm counting on you.

414
00:32:35,807 --> 00:32:38,681
Moto-chan, slow down!

415
00:32:38,764 --> 00:32:44,141
Why do you two get to recite
the Nightingale Pledge?

416
00:32:44,681 --> 00:32:46,349
You asked us that already!

417
00:32:46,474 --> 00:32:48,891
I don't even want to do it.

418
00:32:49,016 --> 00:32:50,326
Me neither.

419
00:32:50,326 --> 00:32:53,682
It's your fault.
You told her I was capable.

420
00:32:53,807 --> 00:32:57,932
Now I have to recite
the last and longest part!

421
00:32:58,057 --> 00:33:02,682
I don't even get a nurse's cap.

422
00:33:06,641 --> 00:33:08,641
My phone.

423
00:33:08,724 --> 00:33:09,807
Hello?

424
00:33:15,099 --> 00:33:17,308
"I will hold in confidence..

425
00:33:17,681 --> 00:33:20,932
all personal matters
committed to my keeping...

426
00:33:21,681 --> 00:33:24,641
and all family affairs
coming to my knowledge...

427
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:27,308
in the practice of my calling."

428
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:29,974
Wow, Moto-chan!

429
00:33:30,099 --> 00:33:34,183
You're really bad
at remembering things.

430
00:33:34,308 --> 00:33:36,433
But you'd better memorize this!

431
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:40,474
You have to make me proud.

432
00:33:41,099 --> 00:33:46,932
And don't embarrass your husband.

433
00:33:47,433 --> 00:33:52,183
I know but, there's a lot of pressure.

434
00:33:52,891 --> 00:33:55,681
"I will endeavor to aid the physician...

435
00:33:55,764 --> 00:34:00,681
and devote myself to the welfare
of those committed to my care."

436
00:34:00,681 --> 00:34:02,433
Moto-chan!

437
00:34:02,932 --> 00:34:03,974
What?

438
00:34:04,183 --> 00:34:07,681
I have a great idea!

439
00:34:08,724 --> 00:34:10,016
What?

440
00:34:10,764 --> 00:34:13,681
At the capping ceremony...

441
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:17,849
What?

442
00:34:22,682 --> 00:34:28,433
<i>One week later, the day of
the capping ceremony finally arrived.</i>

443
00:34:29,891 --> 00:34:32,057
And now...

444
00:34:32,183 --> 00:34:36,724
the Tonan University Nursing School
Capping Ceremony will begin.

445
00:34:38,057 --> 00:34:40,016
Marina Shinagawa.

446
00:34:40,474 --> 00:34:41,474
Yes.

447
00:34:48,558 --> 00:34:49,682
Good luck.

448
00:34:54,849 --> 00:34:56,681
Tomoko Ogura.

449
00:34:56,764 --> 00:34:57,764
Yes.

450
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:05,724
Hey. Where's Motoki?

451
00:35:06,682 --> 00:35:08,724
Keita Kamogari.

452
00:35:08,849 --> 00:35:10,050
Yes.

453
00:35:21,681 --> 00:35:23,765
Kotoko Irie.

454
00:35:24,516 --> 00:35:25,516
Yes.

455
00:35:31,433 --> 00:35:32,681
Good luck.

456
00:35:36,016 --> 00:35:37,600
<i>Naoki...</i>

457
00:35:38,349 --> 00:35:42,681
<i>I'm one step closer to you now.</i>

458
00:35:48,141 --> 00:35:53,266
<i>I wish you could see me
in my nurse's cap.</i>

459
00:35:54,807 --> 00:35:56,891
Motoki Kikyo.

460
00:35:57,016 --> 00:35:58,273
Yes.

461
00:35:58,273 --> 00:35:59,393
Huh?

462
00:36:03,391 --> 00:36:04,641
Motoki!

463
00:36:07,224 --> 00:36:08,558
W-wha...

464
00:36:11,932 --> 00:36:13,891
What is this?

465
00:36:14,016 --> 00:36:17,558
Go change immediately! You'll
desecrate the capping ceremony!

466
00:36:20,681 --> 00:36:22,681
Nurse Hosoi! Please don't!

467
00:36:22,724 --> 00:36:25,558
Moto-chan worked so hard for this!

468
00:36:25,681 --> 00:36:30,016
Men and women care equally
for their patients. Please!

469
00:36:31,974 --> 00:36:33,246
Kotoko...

470
00:36:33,246 --> 00:36:34,681
Please let him do this!

471
00:36:34,681 --> 00:36:36,932
We beg of you!

472
00:36:38,183 --> 00:36:41,681
I don't want a nurse's cap...

473
00:36:41,681 --> 00:36:44,349
but please let Motoki wear one.

474
00:36:44,681 --> 00:36:47,183
- I agree.
- We all do!

475
00:36:54,057 --> 00:36:55,349
Fine.

476
00:36:56,474 --> 00:37:02,391
You win. I'll make an exception
and give Mr. Kikyo a nurse's cap.

477
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:07,057
Really?

478
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,099
Congrats, Moto-chan!

479
00:37:09,516 --> 00:37:13,349
Thank you, Kotoko!
You did it.

480
00:37:15,141 --> 00:37:18,349
Thank you everyone!
I love you!

481
00:37:28,433 --> 00:37:29,681
Good luck.

482
00:37:43,681 --> 00:37:46,308
Thank you, Nurse Hosoi.

483
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:49,765
<i>An exception was made</i>

484
00:37:49,891 --> 00:37:52,765
<i>and Moto-chan got a nurse's cap.</i>

485
00:38:11,349 --> 00:38:17,057

<i>Nursing is demanding. Academically,
emotionally and physically.</i>

505
00:39:51,057 --> 00:39:54,183
<i>But I think I can do it.</i>

506
00:39:55,681 --> 00:39:59,558
<i>When I feel discouraged,
I'll look back on this day...</i>

507
00:40:06,224 --> 00:40:11,016
Who is it? A ghost?

508
00:40:13,681 --> 00:40:15,057
Idiot.

509
00:40:18,681 --> 00:40:20,641
Naoki?!

510
00:40:20,765 --> 00:40:25,099
What are you still doing here?

511
00:40:25,224 --> 00:40:27,681
What about your duty in Nagoya?

512
00:40:27,932 --> 00:40:29,057
Huh?

513
00:40:29,681 --> 00:40:32,183
I took the Shinkansen train back.

514
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:34,681


515
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,266
You came back for me?

516
00:40:37,391 --> 00:40:39,266
I didn't make it in time, though.

517
00:40:39,891 --> 00:40:41,891
The florist was closed.

518
00:40:44,433 --> 00:40:45,807
I don't care.

519
00:40:46,681 --> 00:40:48,099
I don't need flowers.

520
00:40:49,474 --> 00:40:51,308
You came...

521
00:40:55,016 --> 00:40:56,433
Say it.

522
00:40:57,433 --> 00:40:59,349
The part you recited.

523
00:41:00,516 --> 00:41:01,858
Okay.

524
00:41:03,681 --> 00:41:05,099
"With loyalty...

525
00:41:06,433 --> 00:41:09,681
I will endeavor to aid
the physician in his work...

526
00:41:11,391 --> 00:41:13,681
and devote myself to the welfare...

527
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:18,641
of those committed...

528
00:41:20,308 --> 00:41:22,641
to my care."

529
00:41:25,681 --> 00:41:26,807
Again.

530
00:41:28,681 --> 00:41:32,849
"I will endeavor to aid the physician...

531
00:41:33,849 --> 00:41:36,516
and devote myself...

532
00:41:41,391 --> 00:41:42,724
to the welfare...

533
00:41:46,057 --> 00:41:48,641
of those...

534
00:41:50,681 --> 00:41:51,682
committed...

535
00:41:56,308 --> 00:41:58,057
to my care."

536
00:42:19,681 --> 00:42:21,641
<i>Miss Nightingale.</i>

537
00:42:21,682 --> 00:42:25,183
<i>No matter what hardships await me</i>

538
00:42:25,807 --> 00:42:30,224
<i>I will never forget this day.</i>

539
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:38,780

<i>We start training at
the hospital next week.</i>

541
00:44:02,378 --> 00:44:04,211
I'm so nervous...

542
00:44:04,336 --> 00:44:07,210
I'm sure she's a really sweet old lady!

543
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:09,210
You two may get along well.

544
00:44:09,253 --> 00:44:11,795
I can't be remembering trainee's names.

545
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,795
She called me 8 times
this morning alone!

546
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,210
She's a bully!

547
00:44:18,003 --> 00:44:20,420
I'm losing confidence.

548
00:44:20,545 --> 00:44:22,795
Are you going to quit?

549
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:26,253
My chest... my chest hurts.

550
00:44:26,628 --> 00:44:28,336
What's wrong, grandma Toyo?

551
00:23:16,203 --> 00:23:18,996
So you accepted the fact...

552
00:23:21,205 --> 00:23:22,577
Hey!

553
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,205
What are you doing here so early?

554
00:23:27,871 --> 00:23:32,413
I was being a pin cushion
for your wife.

555
00:23:32,538 --> 00:23:34,455
She's being retested today.

556
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:39,121
Well, thanks for your help.

557
00:23:39,703 --> 00:23:42,079
You're something else.

558
00:23:46,038 --> 00:23:49,054
I decided not to pursue
Kotoko anymore.

559
00:23:52,246 --> 00:23:55,580
No matter how terrible
a husband you are.

560
00:24:00,787 --> 00:24:02,704
As long as Kotoko is happy...

561
00:24:04,205 --> 00:24:05,871
I'll keep my mouth shut.
