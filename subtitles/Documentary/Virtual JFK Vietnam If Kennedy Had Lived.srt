NARRATOR: January, 1961.

4
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:02,728
President Dwight D. Eisenhower's
Farewell Address to the Nation.

5
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:07,816
This conjunction of an immense military
establishment and arms industry is new

6
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,110
in the American experience.

7
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,945
EISENHOWER: The totaI influence,

8
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,907
economic, political, even spiritual,

9
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:20,287
is felt in every city, every Statehouse,
every government office.

10
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:23,165
EISENHOWER: We must guard
against the acquisition

11
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:27,086
of unwarranted influence,
whether sought or unsought

12
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,922
by the military-industrial complex.

13
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:33,008
We must never let the weight
of this combination

14
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:36,178
endanger our liberties
or democratic processes.

15
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,348
NARRATOR: November, 1960.

16
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,559
Senator John Fitzgerald Kennedy
of Massachusetts

17
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:46,063
wins one of the narrowest election
victories in American history

18
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:50,692
over Vice President Richard Nixon
by a little more than 100,000 votes.

19
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:55,364
Alongside his beautiful
and elegant wife, Jacqueline Bouvier,

20
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,118
Kennedy is the symbol
of the new freedom of the 1960s,

21
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,621
signifying change and upheaval
to the American public.

22
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,456
"All men are created equal. "

23
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:08,127
JFK: Every degree of mind and spirit
that I possess will be devoted

24
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,420
to the cause of freedom
around the world.

25
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,798
JFK: Today, the proudest boast is,

26
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,883
"Ich bin ein Berliner!"

27
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,636
NARRATOR:
He inherits a secret war against

28
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,597
the Communist Castro
dictatorship in Cuba,

29
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,059
a war run by the CIA
and angry Cuban exiles.

30
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,979
Castro is a successful revolutionary,

31
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:30,482
frightening to American business
interests in Latin America.

32
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:34,194
This war culminates in the disastrous
Bay of Pigs invasion

33
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,113
in April, 1961,

34
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:41,034
when Kennedy refuses to provide
air cover for the exiled Cuban brigade.

35
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:44,538
Kennedy takes public responsibility
for the failure.

36
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,499
He privately claims the CIA lied to him

37
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:52,004
and tried to manipulate him into ordering
an American invasion of Cuba.

[Castro speaks in Spanish]

NARRATOR: In October, 1962

40
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:59,011
the world comes to the brink
of nuclear war

41
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,013
when Kennedy quarantines Cuba

42
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:05,225
after announcing the presence
of offensive Soviet nuclear missiles

43
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,519
90 miles off American shores.

44
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,772
Soviet ships with more missiles
sail towards Cuba

45
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,358
but at the last moment they turn back.

46
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,736
The world breathes with relief.

47
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:20,365
In Washington, rumors abound
that JFK has cut a secret deal

48
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,159
with Russian Premier Khrushchev

49
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:26,622
not to invade Cuba in return
for a Russian withdrawal of missiles.

50
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:30,459
Suspicions abound that Kennedy
is soft on communism.

51
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:35,714
Kennedy also finds himself embroiled
in Laos and Vietnam.

52
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,091
We've got our difficulties there.

53
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:41,136
Unless a greater effort is made
by the government

54
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:44,973
to win popular support,
I don't think the war can be won there.

55
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:48,894
It's their war. They're the ones
who have to win it or lose it.

NARRATOR: Early that fateful summer,

at the American University.

JFK: What kind of peace do I mean?

59
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,153
What kind of peace do we seek?

60
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,280
JFK: Not a Pax Americana

61
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:03,909
enforced on the world
by American weapons of war.

62
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:08,163
We must re-examine our own attitudes
towards the Soviet Union.

63

Our most basic, common link

into the area since 10:00.

But three cars came in during this time

478
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:36,333
from around noon till the time
of the shooting.

479
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,211
They circled the parking lot and left.

Like they was checking the area.

was holding something up to his mouth.

483

BOWERS: The last car came in about seven
to ten minutes before the shooting.

484
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:59,273
It was a white Chevrolet four-door Impala.

00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,276
Muddy up to the windows.

486
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:06,905
BOWERS: Towards the underpass,
I saw two men

487
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,741
standing behind a picket fence

488
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:13,954
looking up towards Main and Houston,
as the caravan came down.

489
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,625
One of them was middle-aged

490
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,043

491

The other man was younger.

on the east end of the parking lot.

They both had uniforms.

At the time of the shooting

there seemed to be some commotion.

out of the ordinary

Oswald was a radar operator.

He'd have about as much use for Russian
as a cat has for pajamas.

June of '62. The Masquerade Bar.

782
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:41,125
Dave Ferrie took me there
expressly to meet him.

JIM: Sexual purposes?

784
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:45,796
BILL: Did he pay you?

785
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:49,592
$20 each time. Ain't no secret.
That's what I'm in here for.

786
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:51,260
JIM: Anything unusual about him

787
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:53,596
you'd be able to describe in court?

788
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:57,099
O'KEEFE: He had something wrong
with his leg. A limp.

789
00:48:57,184 --> 00:49:00,102
Don't get me wrong.
He's not one of those limp wrists.

790
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,272
He's a butch John. Meet him on the street,
you'd never snap.

791
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:08,027
You could play poker with him,
go fishing, you'd never snap.

792
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,863
One night we were at David Ferrie's,

793
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:13,699
sometime late in the summer of '63.

to ten people there.

796
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:23,167
Cuban. Friends who'd done stuff
in the bush with him. Place was a mess.

797
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:26,587
Dave's mind was a mess.
He had caged mice

798
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:29,173
'cause he's working on a cancer cure.

799
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:33,469
Dave's smart, though.
Speaks five languages.

800
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:38,432
Knows philosophy, medicine,
military history, politics.

801
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:43,062
O'KEEFE: He wanted to be a priest.
They defrocked him 'cause he was queer.

JIM: That's where you first met Oswald?

803
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:48,651
O'KEEFE: Strange guy.
Dave introduced him as.

804
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,069
Leon Oswald.

805
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,071
O'KEEFE: How you doing?

OSWALD: What the fuck is he doing here?

807
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,826
Fuck you, motherfucker.

808
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:01,580
Leon's in a bad mood. Don't get excited.

809
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,875
JIM: You said Leon was actually
Lee Harvey Oswald?

810
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:07,545
Yeah. I have no reason to lie to you.

811
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,797
O'KEEFE: I'm already in jail.

Go on.

813
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:14,760
Finally they left

O'KEEFE: Dave pulled out some clippings.

817

He'd been obsessed with Castro
and Kennedy for months.

You want to free Cuba?
Whack out the fucking beard!

I could show you dozens of poisons!
Put it in his food, he'd die in three days.

FERRIE: No trace!

827

Put something in his beard,
make it fall out. He'd look ridiculous.

It could be blamed on Castro,
the country will want to invade Cuba.

to get him in the open.

And that Ruby knew Oswald for years.

933
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:06,672
JIM: Can we talk to her?
LOU: She's dead too.

BILL: Why don't we go
to the horse's mouth?

937
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:21,437
Jack Ruby's been in a Dallas jail cell
for three years. Maybe he'll crack.

938
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:25,691
Can't. If I go to him our investigation
will hit the front pages.

939
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:29,862
It'll blow up in our face.
Susie, what did you find on Oswald?

940
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:33,699
SUSIE: Negative on his tax records.
Classified.

941
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:36,535
First time a DA can't get a tax record.

942
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:43,125
SUSIE: I asked for the CIA files on Oswald
that were part of the Warren Report.

943
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:47,546
About 1,200 documents.
Can't get one of them.

944
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:51,383
All classified as secret on the grounds
of national security.

945
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:54,803
Gave me his grammar school records.
It's a study of his pubic hairs.

[All chuckle]

SUSIE: Lonely kid, no father.

948
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:00,476
Joins the Marines at 17.

949
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:04,480
Learns Russian. Acts overtly Marxist.

950
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:07,983
But he's stationed
at a top-secret air base in Japan

951
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:11,028
where U-2 spy flights
over Russia originate.

952
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:13,197
He's discharged

953
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:16,742
supposedly because his mother's sick.
Stays home three days.

954
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:21,663
Then, with a $1,500 ticket from
a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow.

955
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,291
CONSUL: Mr. Oswald, do you understand

956
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:27,878
- the action you are about to take?
- Yes, I do, sir.

957
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:33,509
OSWALD: I wish to renounce
my citizenship

958
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:36,595
and become a Soviet citizen.

959
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:41,183
I'll give them all the information
I have on the Marines.

960
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:44,770
SUSIE: He disappears for six weeks,
presumably with the KGB.

961
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:47,773
He's taken to a radio factory in Minsk

962
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:51,235
where he lives as high on the hog
as he ever has.

963
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:56,114
He's given 5,000 rubles,
a roomy apartment with a balcony.

964
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:58,450
Has affairs with local girls.

965
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:00,536
Makes sense. He's a spokesman.

[Chuckles]

967
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:05,749
SUSIE: But he never does any propaganda
for the Russians.

968
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,210
He meets Marina.

969
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:11,880
Her uncle is a colonel
in Soviet intelligence.

970
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,842
SUSIE: She thinks he's Russian
by his speech.

971
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:18,929
Six weeks later they marry,
have a daughter.

972
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:23,308
JIM: Only explanation for the royal
treatment is he gave them radar secrets.

973
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,935
JIM: Or fake secrets.

974
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:26,979
Six months after he's in Russia,

975
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:30,649
Francis Gary Powers' U-2 spy flight
goes down

976
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:33,443
in Russia. That plane was untouchable.

977
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,529
SUSIE: Powers hinted that Oswald

978
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:38,574
could've given the Russians
enough data to hit it.

979
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:43,245
As a result, the peace summit between
Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.

980
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:47,499
Perhaps our military didn't want
the conference to happen?

981
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:48,834
Susie, come on.

982
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:51,211
SUSIE: Maybe Oswald was part of that!

983
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:54,673
Stick to what you can prove in court.

984

SUSIE: You want facts?

985

Don't get sidetracked.
How'd he get back to the States?

986
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:03,432
Does he have any problems
with Uncle Sam?

987
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:07,019
No. The State Department issues him
a new passport in 48 hours

988
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:09,354
and loans him travel money.

989
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:15,027
He's never investigated or charged
for revealing classified information

990
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,030
or, as far as we know,
debriefed by the CIA.

991
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:22,200
Bastard should've been prosecuted
as a traitor when he got off the boat.

JIM: Did Marina have problems
getting out?

993
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:29,708
SUSIE: None, though it's almost impossible
to get Russian sweethearts out.

994
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:35,213
This is a man who defected once already.
It's crazy. Ordinary people

995
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:38,800
get blacklisted
for having leftist affiliations.

996
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,135
Doesn't add up.

997
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:43,972
SUSIE: Next thing, he's living
in Dallas-Fort Worth, October '62,

998
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:47,059
working six months
at Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall

999
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:51,396
a photographic firm that makes maps
for the US Army.

1000
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:55,317
Oswald becomes chummy
with the Dallas White Russian community.

1001
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:57,277
All rabid anti-Communists.

1002
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:58,654
It's odd.

1003
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:04,159
SUSIE: His closest friend is an oilman,
named George DeMohrenschildt.

1004
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:09,706
He is 35 years older than Oswald,
who is only 23 and supposedly broke.

1005
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:15,504
He is a part of the Dallas Petroleum Club,
speaks five languages,

1006
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:18,256
and was a French Vichy intelligence
during the war,

1007
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:21,927
also rumored to be a Nazi sympathizer.

1008
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:28,016
DeMohrenschildt draws a picture
of Oswald as an intellectual,

1009
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:32,354
well read, speaks excellent Russian,
a man who adored JFK.

1010
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:39,111
I think he's made some mistakes
regarding Cuba.

1011
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:44,032
I think he's doing a pretty good job.
If he succeeds, in my opinion,

1012
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:47,452
I think he'd make a great President
and a handsome one, too.

1013
01:01:47,745 --> 01:01:50,288
JIM: That's scenery, Susie.
Now, don't get sidetracked.

1014
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:54,334
This is the same man that nailed Oswald
to the Warren Commission

1015
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:57,462
as a potentially violent man
and linked him to the rifle.

1016
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:01,091
OSWALD: Well,
in that sense Castro is an experimenter.

1017
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:05,429
It could go any way with that country.

1018
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:09,391
- It could go the way of the communism...
- What you got there?

1019
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:12,144
Do you have rifles in there?

1020
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:18,942
Tell me what I'm shooting at,
rabbits or Fascists?

1021
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:22,612
- I hunt.
- You hunt?

1022
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:26,199
We don't know he's CIA.
Let's circle him very probable.

1023
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:27,951
Call him Oswald's handler.

1024
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:32,831
SUSIE: The Oswalds are introduced
to Janet and Bill Williams.

1025
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:39,588
It's through Janet Williams,
in October '63, that Lee gets the job

1026
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:43,341
at the warehouse on Elm Street
at the Book Depository.

1027
01:02:44,051 --> 01:02:49,264
JIM: So he can now exercise his intellect,
stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.

1028
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,935
SUSIE: Marina fights with Lee
about many things.

1029
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:56,146
[Lee and Marina argue]

1030
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:58,482
His secrecy, their lack of money.

1031
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:02,527
She says that Lee is not sexually adequate.

1032
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:07,199
Lee hits her on several occasions.

1033
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:09,951
SUSIE: At the age of24,

1034
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:13,497
he rents a room in Dallas
under the alias of O.H. Lee.

1035
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:17,501
Do you want to watch TV?
Are you all right?

1036
01:03:17,835 --> 01:03:19,795
No, thank you. I'm fine.

1037
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:24,633
SUSIE: All I know about the Williams
is their tax returns are classified.

1038
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:28,428
Bill Williams has links to the CIA
through his family

1039
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:31,139
and does classified work
for Bell Helicopter.

1040
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:35,894
Bill's convenient separation from Janet
allows Marina to move into her house

1041
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:38,897
where she suddenly becomes
Marina's best friend.

1042
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:42,025
There Marina and Lee
have a second daughter.

1043
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:46,238
OSWALD: I have to go away.
Just for a short while.

1044
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:48,865
What's wrong with this family?

1045
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:50,659
MARINA: I love Lee

1046
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:52,828
and I sorry him.

1047
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:55,080
REPORTER: Sorry for him?

1048
01:03:55,414 --> 01:03:56,414
MARINA: Yes.

1049
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:59,501
SUSIE: When he's arrested,
Marina buries him with the public.

1050
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:03,129
She describes him as a psychotic
and violent man.

1051
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:04,923
I have too much facts,

1052
01:04:05,049 --> 01:04:09,302
and facts tell me that Lee shot Kennedy.

1053
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:12,764
JIM: After being locked away
by the feds for two months

1054
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,933
and afraid she'd be deported,

1055
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:18,436
she was probably suffering
from nervous exhaustion.

1056
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,856
JIM: They taught her how to answer.

1057
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,942
When they think she's ready,
they buy her dresses,

1058
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:26,278
polish her appearance and wheel her out.

1059
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:28,613
I'd like to thank the Warren Commission.

1060
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:30,282
JIM: Oswald was no angeI.

1061
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:32,701
But who was he?

1062
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:35,620
I'm lost. What are we saying?

1063
01:04:36,747 --> 01:04:40,625
JIM: That when Oswald went to Russia,
he was not a real defector.

1064
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:46,673
He was an intelligence agent for our
government and remained one till he died.

1065
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:49,759
So, because Oswald pulled the trigger,

1066
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:54,389
the intelligence community
murdered the President?

1067
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:56,808
JIM: I'll go you one better.
Maybe Oswald

1068
01:04:56,934 --> 01:04:58,727
didn't pull the trigger.

1069
01:04:58,811 --> 01:05:02,480
Nitrate tests indicate he hadn't fired
a rifle on November 22.

1070
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:06,568
And they didn't bother to see
if the rifle'd been fired that day.

1071
01:05:06,944 --> 01:05:10,447
BILL: His palm print was on it.
JIM: It went to the FBl.

1072
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:13,158
FBl didn't find a goddamn thing.

1073
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:17,996
It comes back a week later and a Dallas
policeman suddenly finds a palm print?

1074
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:22,667
It could've been taken at the morgue.
There's no chain of evidence.

1075
01:05:22,793 --> 01:05:26,755
LOU: I can't figure out why he orders
a traceable weapon

1076
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:31,009
to a P.O. box, when he can go
into any store in Texas,

1077
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:35,013
give a phony name and walk out
with an untraceable rifle.

1078
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:36,431
To frame him, obviously!

1079
01:05:36,515 --> 01:05:38,850
A lot of smoke, but some fire.

1080
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:40,936
We're talking about our government!

1081
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,271
We're talking about a crime.

1082
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:47,192
You must think on a different level,
like the CIA does.

1083
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:50,195
We're through the looking glass.

1084
01:05:50,988 --> 01:05:52,280
White is black.

1085
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:54,991
And black is white.

1086
01:05:55,701 --> 01:05:58,662
Maybe Oswald is just what he said he was.

1087
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:00,497
A patsy.

[Eerie sound effects]

1089
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:08,380
Unbelievable. You were here?

1090
01:06:08,547 --> 01:06:11,049
Yes, this is where I was sitting.

1091
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:14,719
Shots came from near the wooden fence
over there,

1092
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:17,847
near the overpass.

1093
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:21,893
I saw a man run from the fence
toward those railroad cars.

1094
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,771
HOLLAND: I made it clear
to the Warren people.

1095
01:06:24,855 --> 01:06:28,149
One of the shots came
from behind that picket fence.

1096
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:32,570
I heard the report and saw smoke,
six or eight feet above the ground.

1097
01:06:32,863 --> 01:06:34,739
Out from under those trees.

1098

DODD: All four of us railroad men

1100
01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:42,664
The smoke came from behind the hedge.

HILL: I was standing near Mary Moorman,
who took the photo when he was killed.

1102
01:06:49,755 --> 01:06:52,090
I stepped down to the curb and yelled,

1103
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:54,843
"Mr. President, look over here!"

1104
01:06:56,887 --> 01:06:58,430

01:07:09,608 --> 01:07:11,609
The driver had stopped.

01:07:12,236 --> 01:07:14,571
I don't know what was wrong with him.

Out of the corner of my eye,

1112
01:07:19,618 --> 01:07:21,161
I saw a flash of light in the bushes.

1113
01:07:22,413 --> 01:07:23,496

I looked up and saw smoke coming
from over there, on the knoll.

SAM: We came around to look for tracks.

1118
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:38,303
It rained that morning
and we found a bunch.

1119
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:40,221
Cigarette butts.

1120
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:42,682
Someone had stood about here.

1121
01:07:49,106 --> 01:07:50,607
That's a good spot.

01:07:57,573 --> 01:08:01,826
Like people weren't breathing.
Like you were looking at a picture.

1126

Except for one man.

1127
01:08:07,291 --> 01:08:11,753
I saw this one man running
from the corner of the Book Depository

1128
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:13,254
to the parking lot.

1129
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:15,340
MERCER: It was about 11:00 a.m.

1130
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:19,177
I was driving on Elm Street
toward the underpass in a rented car.

1131
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:21,763
MERCER: A light-blue Valiant.

1132
01:08:22,014 --> 01:08:25,350
I'll never forget that day.
There was a lot of traffic

1133
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:28,394
and I stopped
alongside a green pickup truck.

1134
01:08:28,687 --> 01:08:32,982
It was very noticeable
because it had one wheel up on the curb.

1135
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:35,318
When I saw the gun, I thought

1136
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:39,781
"The Secret Service is not very secret. "

1137
01:08:39,865 --> 01:08:42,617
The next morning, I went to the FBl office.

1138
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:44,953
They showed me some pictures.

1139
01:08:45,037 --> 01:08:49,207
And I picked out three pictures
that looked like the truck's driver.

1140
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:50,959
That's the man.

1141
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:54,045
JIM: You mean you identified Jack Ruby
on Saturday?

1142
01:08:54,171 --> 01:08:55,130
MERCER: That's right.

1143
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:57,048
The day before he shot Oswald?

1144
01:08:57,174 --> 01:09:00,677
MERCER: That's right.
When I saw him on TV, I was shocked.

1145
01:09:00,886 --> 01:09:04,222
I said to my family,
"That's the man I saw in the truck. "

1146
01:09:05,724 --> 01:09:08,643
You weren't so sure in your statement
to the Commission.

1147
01:09:09,019 --> 01:09:12,063
What about these others?
You said one might be him?

1148
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:16,484
MERCER: They look a bit like him,
but I'm sure this is the man.

1149
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:18,903
HILL: It was him I chased
up the grassy knoll.

1150
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:24,534
HILL: I thought maybe our guys
had shot back and got one of them.

1151
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:27,036
I got to the parking lot.

1152
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:31,040
All I saw were the railroad workers
and Dallas' finest.

- Secret Service. Come with us.
- No! Find the shooter!

HILL: He put a hurt on me, but good.

1157
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:47,473
They must've seen everything because
they knew what we had done all day.

I wasn't hard to find,
wearing that red raincoat.

that came from the Book Depository.

INTERROGATOR: That's all we'll say.
HILL: No, sir.

1166
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:13,041
I saw a man shooting from behind
that fence. What are you going to do?

1167
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:16,544
HILL: You go out and get him!
INTERROGATOR: That's taken care of!

1168
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:20,215
You only heard three shots,
and don't discuss this with anyone.

1169
01:10:20,966 --> 01:10:22,550
No one. Understand?

1170
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:26,054
HILL: Which is strange 'cause it's less
than 20 minutes after the assassination.

Get her out of here.

as a dog's hind leg.

When I read my testimony
in the Warren Report

1174
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:37,482
it was a total fabrication.

1175

That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison.
They've altered my statements.

1177
01:10:44,823 --> 01:10:49,535
"Mercer couldn't identify any photograph
as being the man she observed

"slouched over the wheel
of the green truck. " Not true.

This is really strange.

That's not mine.

1186

There wasn't any notary present
during my questioning.

1188
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:19,774

[Lounge music]

1191
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:34,038
I used to go there to see Jack
and my friend, Jatta, who danced there.

1192
01:11:34,331 --> 01:11:36,708
It was a real swinging spot in town.

1193

Everybody came.

But Jack was exciting.
There were always cops there.

01:11:52,224 --> 01:11:56,185
Jack liked them around, even though
he threw out the drunks himself.

01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:58,146
He had a violent temper.

1200

Everyone in those days
knew Jack was in the mob.

Cops back then, they were bad.

He was a weird-looking guy.
He had these eyebrows.

1209
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:32,055
And he looked like a buzzard.

1210
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,934
Lee didn't make much of an impression.

1211
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:39,896
He wasn't very handsome.

1212
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:43,816
He didn't look like he had any money,
and he was in a bad mood.

1213
01:12:43,901 --> 01:12:45,943
So, I didn't pay him much mind.

I may not remember a name,
but I always remember a face.

you think they'll think twice
about a two-bit showgirl like me?

I understand the pressure you're under.

understand I can't tell the truth in Dallas?

RUBY: There are people here
who do not want me to tell the truth.

Who don't want me to have a retrial.

That is, if you want to hear
further testimony from me.

01:14:10,487 --> 01:14:12,029
Can you take me with you?

1236
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:13,948
CHIEF JUSTICE: No. It can't be done.

1237
01:14:14,491 --> 01:14:16,534
There would be no safe place for you.

We're not law-enforcement officers.

1239

There's a great deal at stake in this matter.

If I'm eliminated,

1241
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:31,174
there won't be any way of knowing
any bit of truth pertaining to my situation.

1242
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:36,762
Consequently, a whole new form
of government will take over.

And I won't live to see you

LOU: Without really aiming.

The second and third shots came
almost right on top of each other.

1255

It takes a minimum of

1256
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:21,265
2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.

1257
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:24,268
LOU: The other problem is,
there was a tree

1258

blocking the first two shots
when fired in the Zapruder film.

No way.

1265
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,131
FBl tried two sets of tests.

1266
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:57,593
Not one sharpshooter could match
Oswald's performance.

1267
01:15:57,803 --> 01:15:59,095
Not one.

1268
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:01,722
Oswald was at best a medium shot.

1269
01:16:02,307 --> 01:16:04,642
The scope was defective on it too.

1270
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:07,895
This is the whole essence
of the case to me.

1271

LOU: They sold this lemon
to the American public.

The Zapruder film was the proof
they didn't count on.

Why not just shoot Kennedy on Houston?

1279
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:35,006
Plenty of time.

1280

- He's out in the open.
- I keep asking myself the same thing.

1281
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:41,846
- Frontal shot.
- Even if you miss him once,

1282
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:44,265
if he accelerates, you get a second shot.

1283
01:16:44,349 --> 01:16:46,684
LOU: The only reason to get him on Elm

1284
01:16:47,102 --> 01:16:49,854
is you got him in a triangulated crossfire.

1285
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:53,858
You put a team there down at the fence.

1286

LOU: Frontal shot. Flat, low trajectory.

it's a turkey shoot.

Deputy director of the CIA.

Kennedy fired him in '61

he hits the curves like A.J. Foyt

But the Warren Commission
says that Sylvia

1388
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:47,795
has bad eyesight because
they have Oswald in Mexico

1389

trying to get back into Cuba.

1390

The CIA has a camera
outside the Cuban Embassy.

1391
01:22:54,469 --> 01:22:56,220
And they say that this

1392
01:22:57,222 --> 01:22:59,223
is Oswald in Mexico.

1393
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:03,852
OSER: If this is Oswald,
it must be our third Oswald.

1394
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:08,565
JIM: The Warren Commission made great
efforts to make him a Communist.

1395
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:14,113
I think the point of the Mexican episode
was to lay the blame on Fidel Castro.

1396
01:23:15,198 --> 01:23:17,950
If Oswald, or someone purporting
to be Oswald,

1397
01:23:18,034 --> 01:23:21,870
had gotten into Cuba, come back,
and then killed the President,

1398
01:23:22,706 --> 01:23:25,749
the American public would've supported
a Cuban invasion.

1399

I even have doubts about this photo, Boss.

1400
01:23:29,337 --> 01:23:32,506
This convicted Oswald in the public's mind.

1401
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:36,635
But Oswald told Capt. Fritz
that the photo was a fake.

1402
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:38,012
This is not me!

1403

- I never saw this picture.

when the Oswald we know is in Russia

1419
01:24:32,317 --> 01:24:35,694
there is a man using the name of Oswald
to buy trucks

1424

SUSIE: Banister has someone using
the name Oswald to buy the trucks.

Hoover at the FBl has a memo
dated June of 1960

1426

that someone may be using
Oswald's passport and identity.

Just move him around a board.

Boss's got a problem. Real serious.

1842
01:49:11,503 --> 01:49:14,755
- We know what's going on at your office.
- I guess you do.

1843
01:49:14,839 --> 01:49:18,717
You got nothing. I'm a friend.
You're riding on the Titanic.

1844
01:49:19,135 --> 01:49:21,845
Time to jump off
before you get destroyed, too.

1845
01:49:22,264 --> 01:49:23,514
Enough!

1846
01:49:23,598 --> 01:49:26,725
FRANK: We're talking about your career.
You're young.

1847
01:49:27,644 --> 01:49:29,144
You're working the Castro thing.

1848
01:49:29,312 --> 01:49:30,813
- No, I'm not.
- You are.

1849
01:49:30,897 --> 01:49:34,358
We know Oswald didn't pull that trigger.
Castro did.

1850
01:49:35,151 --> 01:49:37,027
If it comes out, there'll be a war.

1851
01:49:37,112 --> 01:49:41,198
Millions of people will die.
That's more important than Jim Garrison.

1852
01:49:41,283 --> 01:49:44,868
FRANK: Look at me when I talk to you!
You're too selfish!

1853
01:49:44,953 --> 01:49:46,245
Shut up!

1854
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:51,417
If you got a brain in your thick skull,
listen to me. Listen real hard.

1855
01:49:52,502 --> 01:49:53,794
Get in the car.

1856
01:49:54,337 --> 01:49:57,006
[Dramatic music plays softly]

1857
01:50:15,609 --> 01:50:17,151
MR. X: Garrison?

1858
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:19,361
Yes.

1859
01:50:20,488 --> 01:50:21,822
Glad you came.

1860
01:50:22,032 --> 01:50:23,949
Sorry about the precautions.

1861
01:50:24,034 --> 01:50:26,869
I just hope it was worth my while, Mr.?

1862
01:50:27,704 --> 01:50:31,457
I could give you a false name,
but I won't. Call me "X."

1863
01:50:33,001 --> 01:50:37,963
I've already been warned by the Agency,
so, if this is another threat...

1864
01:50:38,048 --> 01:50:40,507
MR. X: I'm not with the Agency,
Mr. Garrison.

1865
01:50:41,259 --> 01:50:44,845
If you've come this far,
what I have to say interests you.

1866
01:50:45,221 --> 01:50:48,390
I won't name names or tell you who
or what I represent.

1867
01:50:49,184 --> 01:50:50,976
Except to say you're close.

1868
01:50:52,312 --> 01:50:55,314
Closer than you think.

1869
01:50:57,692 --> 01:51:00,903
MR. X: Everything I'll say is
classified top secret.

1870
01:51:01,321 --> 01:51:04,239
I was a soldier, Mr. Garrison. Two wars.

1871
01:51:05,325 --> 01:51:09,244
A secret Pentagon guy,
supplying the hardware:

1872
01:51:09,329 --> 01:51:11,205
Planes, bullets, rifles,

1873
01:51:11,498 --> 01:51:13,749
for what we call "Black Operations. "

1874
01:51:14,334 --> 01:51:16,835
Black Ops. Assassinations. Coups d'tat,

1875
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:19,838
rigging elections,
propaganda, psych warfare.

1876
01:51:20,924 --> 01:51:24,426
In World War ll, I was in Romania,
Greece, Yugoslavia.

1877
01:51:24,844 --> 01:51:29,098
I helped evacuate part of Nazi intelligence
at the end of the war.

1878
01:51:29,516 --> 01:51:31,975
And we used those guys
against the Communists.

1879
01:51:32,602 --> 01:51:34,937
In Italy, '48, we stole the elections.

1880
01:51:35,021 --> 01:51:37,356
France '49, we broke the strikes.

1881
01:51:37,774 --> 01:51:40,818
MR. X: Overthrew Quirino
in the Philippines, Arbenz in Guatemala,

1882
01:51:40,902 --> 01:51:44,405
Mossadegh in Iran.
We were in Vietnam in '54

1883
01:51:44,489 --> 01:51:46,699
Indonesia, '58, Tibet, '59.

1884
01:51:47,283 --> 01:51:50,703
Got the Dalai Lama out. We were good.

1885
01:51:51,788 --> 01:51:53,122
Very good.

1886
01:51:54,082 --> 01:51:56,792
Then we got into the Cuban thing.
Not so good.

1887
01:51:56,960 --> 01:52:00,254
Set up an invasion to take place
in October, '62.

1888
01:52:00,922 --> 01:52:04,591
MR. X: Khrushchev sent missiles to resist.
Kennedy didn't invade.

1889
01:52:04,843 --> 01:52:07,386
We just had our dicks in the wind.

1890
01:52:07,470 --> 01:52:10,180
A lot of pissed-off people, Mr. Garrison.

1891
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:11,807
Understand?

1892
01:52:12,350 --> 01:52:14,017
I'll come to that later.

1893
01:52:14,477 --> 01:52:16,562
So, 1963.

1894
01:52:17,439 --> 01:52:20,023
I spent much of September of '63

1895
01:52:20,483 --> 01:52:23,444
working on the Kennedy plan
to get all US personnel

1896
01:52:23,528 --> 01:52:26,238
out of Vietnam by the end of 1965.

1897
01:52:26,823 --> 01:52:30,993
One of the strongest plans issued
by the Kennedy White House,

1898
01:52:31,494 --> 01:52:33,829
National Security Memo 263

1899
01:52:34,038 --> 01:52:36,415
ordered home the first 1,000 troops.

1900
01:52:37,125 --> 01:52:41,503
But in November, a week after the murder
of Vietnamese President Diem

1901
01:52:41,588 --> 01:52:44,256
and two weeks before
Kennedy's assassination,

1902
01:52:44,340 --> 01:52:46,717
a strange thing happened to me.

1903
01:52:49,179 --> 01:52:51,054
MR. X: Is Dave in there?

1904
01:52:55,894 --> 01:52:58,020
You wanted to see me, General?

1905
01:52:58,271 --> 01:52:59,646
GENERAL Y: I do, indeed.

1906
01:52:59,939 --> 01:53:01,982
You're going to the South Pole.

1907
01:53:02,650 --> 01:53:03,776
I am?

1908
01:53:03,860 --> 01:53:06,195
GENERAL Y: Dr. Mooney's got the details.

1909
01:53:06,279 --> 01:53:09,031
Check with him. Have a nice vacation.

1910
01:53:09,699 --> 01:53:12,993
MR. X: I was sent by my superior,
we'll call him "Y,"

1911
01:53:13,077 --> 01:53:15,788
I was sent by General Y
to the South Pole

1912
01:53:16,498 --> 01:53:20,167
as military escort for a group
of international VIPs.

1913
01:53:20,668 --> 01:53:23,462
I was on my way back, in New Zealand,

1914
01:53:25,006 --> 01:53:26,215
when the President was killed.

1915
01:53:28,301 --> 01:53:31,637
Oswald was charged at 7:00 p.m.,
Dallas time

1916
01:53:32,222 --> 01:53:37,267
with Tippit's murder. That's 2:00 p.m.
the next day in New Zealand.

1917
01:53:37,352 --> 01:53:40,103
But already their papers
had the entire history

1918
01:53:40,355 --> 01:53:43,190
of this unknown, 24-year-old Oswald.

1919
01:53:43,441 --> 01:53:46,568
Studio picture, detailed biography,
Russian information,

1920
01:53:46,778 --> 01:53:49,780
and were sure that he killed
the President alone

1921
01:53:49,906 --> 01:53:54,201
although it took them four more hours
to charge him with that crime in Dallas.

1922
01:53:56,621 --> 01:53:58,288
It felt to me as if

1923
01:53:59,541 --> 01:54:01,750
a cover story was being put out.

1924
01:54:01,960 --> 01:54:03,877
Like we would in a Black Op.

1925
01:54:04,629 --> 01:54:06,713
MR. X: After I came back

1926
01:54:07,423 --> 01:54:10,968
I asked myself, why was I,
the chief of Special Ops,

1927
01:54:11,135 --> 01:54:14,346
sent to the South Pole to do a job

1928
01:54:14,430 --> 01:54:16,181
many others could have done?

1929
01:54:16,432 --> 01:54:18,100
I wondered if it could've been because

1930
01:54:18,685 --> 01:54:21,228
a routine duty,
if I'd been in Washington

1931
01:54:21,312 --> 01:54:23,689
would've been to order
additional security in Texas.

1932
01:54:23,773 --> 01:54:27,734
I checked it out and found that someone

1933
01:54:27,819 --> 01:54:32,698
told the 112th Military Intelligence Group
at Fort Sam Houston

1934
01:54:32,782 --> 01:54:36,910
to stand down that day,
over the protests of Colonel Reich.

1935
01:54:37,704 --> 01:54:39,454
I believe it's a mistake.

1936
01:54:39,581 --> 01:54:45,168
It's standard procedure, especially
in a known hostile city like Dallas

1937
01:54:45,253 --> 01:54:47,045
to supplement the Secret Service.

1938
01:54:47,130 --> 01:54:50,841
Even if we hadn't let him ride
with the bubble-top off,

1939
01:54:50,925 --> 01:54:55,137
we would've put 100 to 200 agents
on the sidewalk without question.

1940
01:54:55,471 --> 01:54:59,808
A month before, in Dallas, UN Ambassador
Adlai Stevenson was spit on and hit.

1941
01:54:59,976 --> 01:55:02,895
There had been attempts
on De Gaulle's life in France.

1942
01:55:02,979 --> 01:55:05,814
We'd have arrived days ahead,
studied the route,

1943
01:55:05,899 --> 01:55:07,065
checked all buildings.

1944
01:55:07,150 --> 01:55:10,527
Never would've allowed open windows
overlooking Dealey.

1945
01:55:10,945 --> 01:55:12,738
Our own snipers
would've covered the area.

1946
01:55:12,822 --> 01:55:15,407
If a window went up,
they'd have been on the radio!

1947
01:55:15,491 --> 01:55:18,869
We'd be watching the crowd,
packages, rolled-up newspapers, coats.

1948
01:55:18,953 --> 01:55:21,288
Never would've let a man
open an umbrella.

1949
01:55:21,456 --> 01:55:24,333
Never would've let the car slow down
to ten miles an hour.

1950
01:55:24,417 --> 01:55:27,002
Or take that unusual curve
at Houston and Elm.

1951
01:55:27,795 --> 01:55:31,131
You'd have felt an Army presence
in the streets that day.

1952
01:55:31,341 --> 01:55:35,928
But none of this happened. It violated
our most basic protection codes.

1953
01:55:36,346 --> 01:55:40,140
And it is the best indication
of a massive plot in Dallas.

1954
01:55:41,476 --> 01:55:43,560
Who could have best done this?

1955
01:55:43,645 --> 01:55:48,982
MR. X: Black Ops. People in my business.
My superior might call Col. Reich and say,

1956
01:55:49,233 --> 01:55:53,570
"We have another unit coming for security.
You'll stand down. "

1957
01:55:53,947 --> 01:55:57,366
That day, some Army intelligence people
were in Dallas.

1958
01:55:57,450 --> 01:55:59,117
I don't know who or why.

1959
01:55:59,577 --> 01:56:01,411
But they weren't protecting clients.

1960
01:56:01,496 --> 01:56:05,874
And Oswald. Army Intell had
a Lee Harvey Oswald on file.

1961
01:56:06,417 --> 01:56:08,543
MR. X: Those files have been destroyed.

1962
01:56:08,878 --> 01:56:10,212
Many strange things were happening.

1963
01:56:10,296 --> 01:56:13,382
MR. X: Oswald had nothing
to do with them.

1964
01:56:15,343 --> 01:56:17,761
The entire Cabinet was in the Far East.

1965
01:56:17,845 --> 01:56:20,931
A third of a combat division
was returning from Germany

1966
01:56:21,099 --> 01:56:24,768
in the air above the United States,
at the time of the shooting.

1967
01:56:25,061 --> 01:56:30,190
At 12:34 p.m., the Washington
telephone system went out for an hour.

1968
01:56:30,650 --> 01:56:32,693
On the plane back to Washington,

1969
01:56:32,777 --> 01:56:35,112
word was radioed
from the Situations Room

1970
01:56:35,196 --> 01:56:40,575
to Johnson that there was one assassin.
Sound like coincidences to you?

1971
01:56:41,369 --> 01:56:42,869
Not for one moment.

1972
01:56:43,454 --> 01:56:46,081
The Cabinet was out of the way.

1973
01:56:46,791 --> 01:56:48,875
Troops for riot control were in the air.

1974
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:53,005
Telephones were out to stop
the wrong stories from spreading.

1975
01:56:53,214 --> 01:56:54,756
Nothing was left to chance.

1976
01:56:55,258 --> 01:56:57,759
He could not be allowed to escape alive.

1977
01:57:01,097 --> 01:57:03,473
Things were never the same after that.

1978
01:57:04,934 --> 01:57:07,769
Vietnam started for real.
There was an air of

1979
01:57:08,146 --> 01:57:10,939
make-believe in the Pentagon and CIA.

1980
01:57:11,399 --> 01:57:15,569
Those of us in Secret Ops knew
the Warren Commission was fiction.

1981
01:57:16,237 --> 01:57:17,988
But there was something

1982
01:57:18,322 --> 01:57:19,656
deeper.

1983
01:57:19,866 --> 01:57:20,949
Uglier.

1984
01:57:21,034 --> 01:57:24,327
I knew Allen Dulles well.
I often briefed him in his house.

1985
01:57:24,412 --> 01:57:29,666
But why was he appointed to investigate
Kennedy's death? The man who fired him.

1986
01:57:30,293 --> 01:57:33,462
MR. X: Dulles, by the way,
was General Y's benefactor.

1987
01:57:35,631 --> 01:57:37,340
I got out in '64.

1988
01:57:38,176 --> 01:57:39,885
Resigned my commission.

1989
01:57:41,554 --> 01:57:45,474
I never realized Kennedy was so dangerous
to the establishment.

1990
01:57:46,267 --> 01:57:47,726
Is that why?

1991
01:57:48,227 --> 01:57:50,896
That's the real question, isn't it? Why?

1992
01:57:51,355 --> 01:57:54,775
The how and the who is just scenery
for the public.

1993
01:57:55,610 --> 01:57:58,570
Oswald, Ruby, Cuba, the Mafia,

1994
01:57:59,072 --> 01:58:01,031
keeps them guessing, like a game.

1995
01:58:01,115 --> 01:58:04,284
Prevents them from asking
the most important question: why?

1996
01:58:04,410 --> 01:58:07,204
Why was Kennedy killed? Who benefited?

1997
01:58:07,622 --> 01:58:10,624
Who has the power to cover it up? Who?

1998
01:58:14,420 --> 01:58:16,004
MR. X: In 1961,

1999
01:58:17,340 --> 01:58:20,801
right after the Bay of Pigs,
very few people know this,

2000
01:58:21,344 --> 01:58:26,306
I participated in drawing up
National Security Action Memos 55, 56, 57.

2001
01:58:26,432 --> 01:58:29,267
These are documents classified top secret.

2002
01:58:29,560 --> 01:58:33,605
In them, Kennedy told Gen. Lemnitzer,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs

2003
01:58:33,689 --> 01:58:37,776
that from here on, the Joint Chiefs
would be wholly responsible

2004
01:58:37,860 --> 01:58:40,987
for all covert paramilitary action
in peacetime.

2005
01:58:41,447 --> 01:58:43,782
This ended the reign of the CIA.

2006
01:58:44,117 --> 01:58:47,619
Splintered it into 1,000 pieces,
as JFK promised he would.

2007
01:58:47,870 --> 01:58:50,122
And now he was ordering the military

2008
01:58:50,206 --> 01:58:52,374
to help him do it. Unprecedented!

2009
01:58:52,625 --> 01:58:57,212
I can't tell you the shock waves this sent
along the corridors of power.

2010
01:58:57,463 --> 01:58:59,548
This and the firing of Allen Dulles,

2011
01:58:59,632 --> 01:59:02,050
Richard Bissell and Gen. Charles Cabell.

2012
01:59:02,135 --> 01:59:05,470
All were sacred cows in Intell
since World War ll.

2013
01:59:05,930 --> 01:59:08,098
They got some very upset people.

2014
01:59:09,142 --> 01:59:12,018
Kennedy's directives weren't implemented
because of

2015
01:59:12,228 --> 01:59:14,396
bureaucratic resistance.

2016
01:59:15,231 --> 01:59:17,315
But one of the results was

2017
01:59:17,525 --> 01:59:21,027
the Cuban operation was turned over
to my department

2018
01:59:21,737 --> 01:59:23,572
as Operation Mongoose.

2019
01:59:24,282 --> 01:59:26,408
Mongoose was pure Black Ops.

2020
01:59:26,909 --> 01:59:29,995
It was secretly based at Miami University,

2021
01:59:30,413 --> 01:59:33,331
which has the largest
domestic CIA station,

2022
01:59:33,583 --> 01:59:36,501
budgeted annually for hundreds
of millions of dollars.

2023
01:59:36,711 --> 01:59:39,713
Three hundred agents, 7,000 select Cubans.

2024
01:59:40,173 --> 01:59:42,841
Fifty fake business fronts
to launder money.

2025
01:59:43,009 --> 01:59:45,719
They waged a non-stop war against Castro.

2026
01:59:45,803 --> 01:59:48,680
Industrial sabotage, crop burning, etc.

2027
01:59:48,764 --> 01:59:51,266
All under the control of General Y.

2028
01:59:51,684 --> 01:59:54,394
He took the rules of covert warfare
he'd used abroad

2029
01:59:54,478 --> 01:59:56,313
and brought them to this country.

2030
01:59:56,439 --> 01:59:59,191
Now he had the people,
the equipment, the bases

2031
01:59:59,275 --> 02:00:00,275
and the motivation.

2032
02:00:01,110 --> 02:00:05,780
Don't underestimate the budget cuts
that Kennedy called for in March of 1963.

2033
02:00:05,865 --> 02:00:08,867
Nearly 52 military installations
in 25 states.

2034
02:00:08,951 --> 02:00:11,077
Twenty-one overseas bases.

2035
02:00:11,287 --> 02:00:12,662
Big money.

2036
02:00:12,914 --> 02:00:16,249
You know how many helicopters
have been lost in Vietnam?

2037
02:00:17,084 --> 02:00:18,919
Nearly 3,000 so far.

2038
02:00:19,879 --> 02:00:23,048
MR. X: Who makes them?
Bell Helicopter. Who owns Bell?

2039
02:00:23,257 --> 02:00:27,052
Bell was nearly bankrupt when First
National Bank of Boston asked the CIA

2040
02:00:27,136 --> 02:00:31,223
to use the helicopter in Indochina.
How about the F-111 fighter?

2041
02:00:31,724 --> 02:00:34,809
General Dynamics of Fort Worth, Texas.
Who owns that?

2042
02:00:34,894 --> 02:00:39,648
Find out the defense budget since
the war began. $75 going on $100 billion.

2043
02:00:40,024 --> 02:00:43,026
Nearly $200 billion will be spent
before it's over.

2044
02:00:43,402 --> 02:00:45,403
In 1949, it was $10 billion.

2045
02:00:45,655 --> 02:00:47,405
No war, no money.

2046
02:00:48,491 --> 02:00:52,118
The organizing principle
of any society, Mr. Garrison,

2047
02:00:52,203 --> 02:00:53,703
is for war.

2048
02:00:54,038 --> 02:00:58,041
The authority of the state over its people
resides in its war powers.

2049
02:00:58,501 --> 02:01:01,378
Kennedy wanted to end the Cold War
in his second term.

2050
02:01:01,587 --> 02:01:05,048
He wanted to call off the moon race
and cooperate with the Soviets.

2051
02:01:05,132 --> 02:01:07,717
He signed a treaty to ban nuclear testing.

2052
02:01:07,843 --> 02:01:10,387
He refused to invade Cuba in 1962.

2053
02:01:10,680 --> 02:01:13,306
He set out to withdraw from Vietnam.

2054
02:01:14,558 --> 02:01:18,311
But all that ended
on the 22nd of November, 1963.

2055
02:01:19,313 --> 02:01:23,733
MR. X: Since 1961, they knew Kennedy
was not going to war in Southeast Asia.

2056
02:01:24,068 --> 02:01:26,528
Like Caesar, he is surrounded by enemies.

2057
02:01:26,612 --> 02:01:31,283
Something's underway, but it has no face.
Yet, everybody in the loop knows.

2058
02:01:31,367 --> 02:01:33,201
WHITE HOUSE MAN 1:
Forget about combat troops.

2059
02:01:33,286 --> 02:01:36,871
He told McNamara he would pull out
the goddamn advisors!

2060
02:01:37,957 --> 02:01:42,711
He fucked us in Laos and now
he will fuck us in Vietnam!

2061
02:01:42,795 --> 02:01:45,880
WHITE HOUSE MAN 3: He can't afford
to implement it before the election.

2062
02:01:45,965 --> 02:01:48,466
I hear the NSC meeting
was a real barn burner.

2063
02:01:48,551 --> 02:01:51,052
WHITE HOUSE MAN 4: I wouldn't have
missed it for the world.

2064
02:01:51,137 --> 02:01:53,263
Heads will roll. Hear about Lemnitzer?

2065
02:01:53,347 --> 02:01:54,389
WHITE HOUSE MAN 2: What?

2066
02:01:54,473 --> 02:01:57,017
WHITE HOUSE MAN 4: Kennedy rubbed
Lem's nose in shit.

2067
02:01:57,101 --> 02:01:59,811
Said if we didn't go into Cuba,
which was so close,

2068
02:01:59,895 --> 02:02:02,689
why go into Vietnam
which is so far away?

2069
02:02:02,773 --> 02:02:04,399
WHITE HOUSE MAN 2:
There he goes again.

2070
02:02:04,483 --> 02:02:06,693
Got his hand on the chicken switch.

2071
02:02:06,777 --> 02:02:10,322
Lem said that the
Chiefs still think we should go into Cuba.

2072
02:02:10,406 --> 02:02:11,489
MR. X: Money's at stake.

2073
02:02:11,574 --> 02:02:13,992
Big money. $100 billion.

2074
02:02:15,036 --> 02:02:17,746
Kennedy bred voting districts
for defense dollars.

2075
02:02:18,247 --> 02:02:22,584
He gave TFX fighter contracts only
to those counties that will matter in '64.

2076
02:02:22,793 --> 02:02:25,628
The people in the loop fight back.
Their way.

2077
02:02:25,713 --> 02:02:28,173
We have to control the intelligence
from Saigon.

2078
02:02:28,466 --> 02:02:32,427
JOHNSON: We just don't let McNamara
stick his nose in this thing!

2079
02:02:32,511 --> 02:02:36,681
Every time he goes over to Saigon
for a fact-finding mission

2080
02:02:36,766 --> 02:02:39,684
he comes back and scares the shit
out of Kennedy!

2081
02:02:39,894 --> 02:02:41,686
JOHNSON: Now I want Max Taylor on him
night and day,

2082
02:02:42,188 --> 02:02:43,897
like a fly on shit.

2083
02:02:44,982 --> 02:02:48,943
You control McNamara,
you control Kennedy.

2084
02:02:49,278 --> 02:02:50,612
MR. X: I think it started like that.

2085
02:02:51,030 --> 02:02:52,447
In the wind.

2086
02:02:52,615 --> 02:02:56,368
Defense contractors, oil bankers.
Just conversation.

2087
02:02:56,702 --> 02:03:00,455
A call is made. Maybe to someone
like my superior officer General Y.

02:03:04,627 --> 02:03:05,710
When?

2090
02:03:06,128 --> 02:03:09,255
CONSPIRATOR: In the fall.
Probably in the South.

2091
02:03:09,340 --> 02:03:11,966
- We want you to come up with a plan.
- I can do that.

2092
02:03:12,218 --> 02:03:13,593
MR. X: Everything is cellularized.

2093
02:03:13,677 --> 02:03:18,056
No one said, "He must die. " No vote.
Nothing's on paper.

2094
02:03:18,140 --> 02:03:20,100
There's no one to blame.

2095
02:03:20,309 --> 02:03:22,352
It's as old as the crucifixion.

2096
02:03:22,686 --> 02:03:24,646
Or the military firing squad.

2097
02:03:24,939 --> 02:03:28,316
Five bullets, one blank. No one's guilty.

2098
02:03:28,567 --> 02:03:30,402
Everybody in the power structure

2099
02:03:30,945 --> 02:03:32,487
has a plausible deniability.

2100
02:03:32,571 --> 02:03:36,658
No compromising connections
except at the most secret point.

2101
02:03:37,368 --> 02:03:39,869
But it must succeed.

2102

No matter how many die
or how much it costs,

2103
02:03:42,498 --> 02:03:45,125
the perpetrators must be
on the winning side,

2104
02:03:45,209 --> 02:03:49,045
and never subject to prosecution
for anything by anyone.

2105
02:03:49,713 --> 02:03:51,589
That is a coup d'tat.

[General Y converses with conspirator]

MR. X: Kennedy announces
the Texas trip in September.

2108

At that moment,
second Oswalds pop up all over Dallas

2293
02:14:44,034 --> 02:14:45,409
[Liz sobs]

2294
02:14:46,119 --> 02:14:47,745
You don't believe me?

2295
02:14:48,205 --> 02:14:50,998
LIZ: I don't know!
JIM: You never believed me?

2296
02:14:52,084 --> 02:14:55,836
I just want to raise our children
and live a normal life.

2297
02:14:55,962 --> 02:14:57,963
LIZ: I want my life back!

2298
02:14:58,882 --> 02:15:00,716
So do I, goddamn it!

2299
02:15:01,301 --> 02:15:03,344
I had a life too, you know!

2300
02:15:03,720 --> 02:15:07,515
You can't bury your head in the sand
like an ostrich, Liz!

2301
02:15:07,766 --> 02:15:12,436
It's not about our well-being, our two cars,
our TVs and your kitchen!

2302
02:15:14,231 --> 02:15:17,483
It's about our kids growing up
in a shithole of lies. I'm angry!

2303
02:15:17,567 --> 02:15:19,693
My life is fucked because of it.

2304
02:15:19,986 --> 02:15:23,155
If you could see it that way,
you'd see your life is fucked too.

2305
02:15:23,240 --> 02:15:24,990
You never talked to me this way.

2306
02:15:25,075 --> 02:15:27,201
If you don't want to support me, fine.

2307
02:15:27,285 --> 02:15:30,204
But don't make threats
about taking the children.

2308
02:15:30,288 --> 02:15:31,664
LIZ: I'm leaving you!

2309
02:15:31,957 --> 02:15:34,500
LIZ: I'm taking the children!
JIM: Go on! Get out!

2310
02:15:34,584 --> 02:15:36,127
LIZ: I am!
JIM: Go hide!

2311
02:15:36,211 --> 02:15:38,420
JIM: Join the rest! They'll say I'm crazy.

2312
02:15:38,505 --> 02:15:41,298
Plenty of people will tell you I'm crazy.

2313
02:15:42,884 --> 02:15:46,262
You won't have any problems
filling out divorce papers.

2314
02:15:47,305 --> 02:15:49,807
But somebody's got to try, goddamn it!

2315
02:15:50,100 --> 02:15:51,433
Somebody!

2316
02:15:55,647 --> 02:15:57,731
Are we going away, Daddy?

2317
02:16:05,115 --> 02:16:06,907
JIM: I don't know, Jasper.

2318
02:16:07,659 --> 02:16:09,076
JASPER: Because of Kennedy?

2319
02:16:09,786 --> 02:16:12,371
Will the same people kill us, Papa?

2320
02:16:15,125 --> 02:16:16,959
JIM: Nobody will kill us.

2321
02:16:17,627 --> 02:16:19,128
JASPER: I'm scared.

2322
02:16:20,005 --> 02:16:23,257
VIRGINIA: I don't like it
when you and Mommy fight.

2323
02:16:25,802 --> 02:16:28,012
JIM: I don't like it either, honey.

2324
02:16:28,930 --> 02:16:31,098
VIRGINIA: Why do we have to leave?

2325
02:16:31,683 --> 02:16:33,809
Don't you love us anymore?

2326
02:16:36,646 --> 02:16:38,522
Daddy loves you both.

2327
02:16:40,192 --> 02:16:43,569
There's nothing wrong
with feeling a little scared, Jasper.

2328
02:16:43,820 --> 02:16:47,114
Telling the truth can be
a scary thing sometimes.

2329
02:16:47,991 --> 02:16:51,160
It scared President Kennedy,
and he was a brave man.

2330
02:16:51,995 --> 02:16:54,663
But if you let yourself be too scared

2331
02:16:54,873 --> 02:16:58,000
then you let the bad guys
take over the country.

2332
02:16:59,586 --> 02:17:01,587
Then everybody gets scared.

2333
02:17:02,505 --> 02:17:04,131
Stay with Mom, Papa.

2334
02:17:04,341 --> 02:17:05,591
Please.

2335
02:17:13,266 --> 02:17:14,642
OSER: Here's another.

2336
02:17:14,726 --> 02:17:18,103
The US Attorney in Washington declines
to serve our subpoena

2337
02:17:18,188 --> 02:17:22,566
on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell,
CIA Director Richard Helms, any FBl agent.

2338
02:17:22,692 --> 02:17:25,361
JIM: What'd you expect from a pig
but a grunt?

2339
02:17:25,570 --> 02:17:29,865
OSER: Now it'll be near impossible
to prove Shaw's connection to the CIA.

2340
02:17:30,033 --> 02:17:31,408
What's going on?

2341
02:17:31,576 --> 02:17:34,995
We've never been refused
an extradition request.

2342
02:17:35,080 --> 02:17:37,164
OSER: Let's get Julia Ann Mercer in here.

2343
02:17:37,249 --> 02:17:39,124
JIM: No, she could get hurt.

2344
02:17:39,834 --> 02:17:41,835
Look what's happening to other people.

2345
02:17:41,920 --> 02:17:43,837
She's the best witness we have.

2346
02:17:43,922 --> 02:17:47,007
I just don't want to do it. Now, what else?

2347
02:17:48,301 --> 02:17:52,137
NUMA: You got your hate mail here.
And your fan mail here.

2348
02:17:52,973 --> 02:17:57,851
The bad news is that the IRS requested
an audit of your income from this office.

2349
02:17:58,561 --> 02:18:02,398
I expected that two months ago.
They're wasting their time.

2350
02:18:05,235 --> 02:18:09,405
The bad news is the National Guard
just asked me to resign after 18 years.

2351
02:18:10,615 --> 02:18:14,285
Maybe that's the good news.
Never was as good as combat.

2352
02:18:15,453 --> 02:18:16,495
But this is.

2353
02:18:16,955 --> 02:18:17,955
[All chuckle]

2354
02:18:18,081 --> 02:18:19,873
Any more on Oswald or Shaw?

2355
02:18:20,041 --> 02:18:24,545
They were seen together in Clinton
in early September.

2356
02:18:25,046 --> 02:18:28,841
The Civil Rights Movement
was running a voter's registration drive.

2357
02:18:29,259 --> 02:18:32,970
Rumor is, Shaw was working
on some arms deal

2358
02:18:33,054 --> 02:18:35,472
to discredit the Civil Rights Movement.

2359
02:18:35,557 --> 02:18:38,684
Nobody really knows
what they were doing there, but

2360
02:18:38,768 --> 02:18:40,936
hell, they stood out like cotton balls.

2361
02:18:41,021 --> 02:18:43,731
I got whites and coloreds
that saw them there.

2362
02:18:43,815 --> 02:18:47,276
Last time I checked,
it was not illegal to register to vote.

2363
02:18:48,194 --> 02:18:49,903
BILL: We still got the

2364
02:18:50,238 --> 02:18:54,742
the junkie, Vernon Bundy,
who saw him talking at the sea wall.

2365
02:18:55,368 --> 02:18:58,120
This is tough.
No one wants to talk about Shaw.

2366
02:18:58,455 --> 02:18:59,997
You keep saying that.

2367
02:19:00,582 --> 02:19:02,833
- I keep saying what?
- You're not digging deep enough.

2368
02:19:02,917 --> 02:19:06,003
You want to do my job!
You do my job, I'll do your job.

2369
02:19:06,087 --> 02:19:08,964
JIM: I think Clinton is a breakthrough now.

2370
02:19:10,050 --> 02:19:12,426
Shaw denies ever knowing Oswald, right?

2371
02:19:13,595 --> 02:19:15,304
That proves he's a liar.

2372
02:19:17,265 --> 02:19:19,266
- Keep on it, Bill.
- This is the interesting part.

2373
02:19:19,809 --> 02:19:22,144
Oswald went to see the FBl two weeks

2374
02:19:22,395 --> 02:19:23,896
before the assassination.

2375
02:19:23,980 --> 02:19:25,856
OSWALD: May I see Special Agent Hosty?

2376
02:19:25,940 --> 02:19:27,858
FBl RECEPTIONIST: He's not in.
Can someone else help you?

2377
02:19:27,942 --> 02:19:32,237
SUSIE: Special Agent Hosty made
three visits to Janet Williams' house

2378
02:19:32,322 --> 02:19:34,990
to keep an eye on Marina. He left a note.

2379
02:19:35,075 --> 02:19:38,077
Hosty told a newspaperman
it was a warning

2380
02:19:38,328 --> 02:19:42,039
to stop questioning Marina
when Oswald was not present.

2381
02:19:42,123 --> 02:19:46,794
She was not a citizen, so possibly
he was threatening to deport her to Russia.

2382
02:19:47,379 --> 02:19:49,546
But what the note really said,
no one knows.

2383
02:19:50,090 --> 02:19:52,716
SUSIE: Hosty tore it up and flushed it
down the toilet.

2384
02:19:52,801 --> 02:19:54,426
JIM: This is just speculation.

2385
02:19:54,594 --> 02:19:58,722
But what if the note described
the assassination attempt on JFK?

2386
02:20:04,979 --> 02:20:06,605
Come on, think!

2387
02:20:06,940 --> 02:20:09,274
That's the only reason to destroy it.

2388
02:20:09,609 --> 02:20:13,529
If it was a threat like Hosty said,
they would have kept it.

2389
02:20:13,988 --> 02:20:17,783
It makes their case against the angry,
lone nut that much stronger.

2390
02:20:18,701 --> 02:20:20,494
JIM: Remember the meeting
with Agent Quigley

2391
02:20:20,578 --> 02:20:22,079
the day he was arrested?

2392
02:20:22,163 --> 02:20:24,998
Quigley destroyed the notes
from the interview.

2393
02:20:25,291 --> 02:20:29,336
We can raise the possibility
that Oswald was not only an informant

2394
02:20:29,921 --> 02:20:34,800
but he may have been the original source
for the telex dated November 17

2395
02:20:35,301 --> 02:20:39,388
warning of Kennedy's assassination
in Dallas on November 22.

2396
02:20:41,808 --> 02:20:46,353
JIM: William Walter, the FBl night clerk,
gave me a copy.

2397
02:20:46,438 --> 02:20:49,064
It went all over the country.
Nothing was done.

2398
02:20:49,149 --> 02:20:52,693
The motorcade went ahead on schedule.
The Warren Report didn't mention it.

2399
02:20:52,777 --> 02:20:57,281
OSER: "A militant group may attempt
to assassinate President Kennedy

2400
02:20:57,365 --> 02:20:59,324
"on his proposed trip to Dallas, Texas. "

2401
02:20:59,701 --> 02:21:01,285
JIM: Shortly after the assassination

2402
02:21:01,369 --> 02:21:05,664
Walter says the telex was removed
from all the files

2403
02:21:05,748 --> 02:21:08,542
as an obvious embarrassment
to the Bureau.

2404
02:21:09,711 --> 02:21:12,212
I believe Oswald sent information
through Hosty.

2405
02:21:12,630 --> 02:21:16,341
JIM: I have a hunch Oswald
had infiltrated this group:

2406
02:21:16,509 --> 02:21:18,677
Cubans or right-wing extremists.

2407
02:21:19,471 --> 02:21:22,931
He was told to be
at the Book Depository that day

2408
02:21:23,308 --> 02:21:26,435
to either prevent the assassination
or take part in it.

2409
02:21:26,811 --> 02:21:30,314
JIM: Either they told him
they'd close down the plotters

2410
02:21:31,316 --> 02:21:32,774
or simulate an attack

2411
02:21:32,859 --> 02:21:35,235
on Kennedy to whip up public opinion

2412
02:21:35,320 --> 02:21:38,822
so Kennedy would have to reverse
his policies on communism.

2413
02:21:39,324 --> 02:21:41,742
JIM: What they told him doesn't matter.

2414
02:21:42,035 --> 02:21:43,535
He was under orders.

2415
02:21:43,620 --> 02:21:45,496
He was a foot soldier.

2416
02:21:48,041 --> 02:21:51,001
You can't miss. He is a dead duck.

2417
02:21:52,045 --> 02:21:53,337
BILL: I don't buy it.

2418
02:21:53,796 --> 02:21:55,756
Why would the FBl cover it up?

2419
02:21:56,049 --> 02:21:59,760
A telex disappears from every FBl office
in this country?

2420
02:22:00,345 --> 02:22:01,970
JIM: There's a word, Bill.

2421
02:22:02,055 --> 02:22:04,223
JIM: Orders.
SUSIE: Or a cover-up.

2422
02:22:05,099 --> 02:22:08,101
Don't you have enough proof
of the FBl's complicity yet?

2423
02:22:08,228 --> 02:22:10,562
I respect this country's institutions!

2424
02:22:12,815 --> 02:22:15,692
How the hell can you keep
a conspiracy going

2425
02:22:15,777 --> 02:22:21,281
between the mob, CIA, FBl, Army
intelligence and who knows what else,

2426
02:22:21,366 --> 02:22:25,244
when you can't keep a secret
in this room between 12 people?

2427
02:22:25,453 --> 02:22:27,454
I mean, we got leaks everywhere.

2428
02:22:27,539 --> 02:22:30,332
We are going to trial, y'all!

2429
02:22:30,416 --> 02:22:32,584
What the hell do we really got?

2430
02:22:32,835 --> 02:22:35,921
Oswald, Ruby, Banister,
and Ferrie are dead.

2431
02:22:36,464 --> 02:22:39,258
Maybe Shaw is an agent. I don't know.

2432
02:22:39,384 --> 02:22:41,218
But as a covert operator

2433
02:22:41,302 --> 02:22:44,429
he is wide open for blackmail
because of his homosexuality.

2434
02:22:44,514 --> 02:22:48,642
JIM: Shaw's our toehold.
I don't know or care exactly how he fits.

2435
02:22:49,310 --> 02:22:51,979
JIM: But he's lying through his teeth.
I won't let go of him.

2436
02:22:52,063 --> 02:22:55,190
That's why you're going to trial
against Clay Shaw?

2437
02:22:55,275 --> 02:22:56,817
You will lose!

2438
02:22:57,110 --> 02:22:59,987
BILL: We should investigate
our Mafia leads here.

2439
02:23:00,071 --> 02:23:03,282
I can buy that easier
than I can the government.

2440
02:23:04,576 --> 02:23:08,161
BILL: Ruby is all mob,
knows Oswald, sets him up.

2441
02:23:08,746 --> 02:23:12,749
Hoffa, Trafficante, Marcello,
they hire some guns and do Kennedy.

2442
02:23:13,084 --> 02:23:16,336
The government doesn't want
to open up a whole can of worms

2443
02:23:16,421 --> 02:23:19,673
because it used the mob
to try to get Castro.

2444
02:23:20,383 --> 02:23:23,885
Castro being assassinated
by the mob by us

2445
02:23:23,970 --> 02:23:25,971
sounds wild to John Q. Citizen.

2446
02:23:26,055 --> 02:23:28,599
So they close the book on JFK.

2447
02:23:30,101 --> 02:23:31,602
Makes perfect sense to me.

2448
02:23:31,686 --> 02:23:34,688
I don't doubt their involvement
at a low level.

2449
02:23:35,481 --> 02:23:37,858
Could the mob change the parade route?

2450
02:23:38,234 --> 02:23:41,194
JIM: Or eliminate the protection
for the President?

2451
02:23:41,362 --> 02:23:44,698
Could the mob send Oswald to Russia
and get him back?

2452
02:23:44,866 --> 02:23:48,994
Get the FBl, the CIA and the Dallas Police
to mess up the investigation?

2453
02:23:49,078 --> 02:23:52,414
Get the Warren Commission appointed
to cover it up?

2454
02:23:53,458 --> 02:23:57,753
Wreck the autopsy? Influence
the national media to go to sleep?

2455
02:23:58,046 --> 02:24:01,548
Since when has the mob used anything
but. 38's for hits up close?

2456
02:24:03,384 --> 02:24:07,679
The mob wouldn't have the guts or
the power for something of this magnitude.

2457
02:24:07,805 --> 02:24:09,848
Assassins need payrolls,

2458
02:24:10,391 --> 02:24:12,476
schedules, times, orders.

2459
02:24:13,394 --> 02:24:16,104
This was a military-style ambush.

2460
02:24:16,189 --> 02:24:19,691
A coup d'tat with Lyndon Johnson
waiting in the wings.

2461
02:24:19,984 --> 02:24:23,779
You're saying Lyndon Johnson
was involved? The President?

2462
02:24:24,322 --> 02:24:27,783
Johnson got $1 billion for his friends,
Brown and Root

2463
02:24:27,867 --> 02:24:30,202
to dredge Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam.

2464
02:24:30,453 --> 02:24:33,664
Boss, are you calling the President
a murderer?

2465
02:24:33,831 --> 02:24:37,501
If I'm so far from the truth,
why is the FBl bugging our offices?

2466
02:24:37,585 --> 02:24:40,128
Why are witnesses being bought off
and murdered?

2467
02:24:40,546 --> 02:24:44,174
Why are federal agencies blocking
our extraditions and subpoenas?

2468
02:24:44,342 --> 02:24:46,259
[Stammers] I don't know.

2469
02:24:46,344 --> 02:24:49,262
Maybe there's some rogue element
in the government.

2470
02:24:49,347 --> 02:24:51,515
JIM: With a full-blown cover-up?

2471
02:24:52,892 --> 02:24:54,893
You ever read Shakespeare?

2472
02:24:56,187 --> 02:24:57,354
Yeah.

2473
02:24:57,605 --> 02:24:58,772
I do.

2474
02:24:59,440 --> 02:25:00,941
JIM: Julius Caesar?

2475
02:25:01,693 --> 02:25:04,986
"Brutus and Cassius,
they too are honorable men. "

2476
02:25:05,738 --> 02:25:07,406
Who killed Caesar?

2477
02:25:08,199 --> 02:25:10,200
Ten or twelve Senators.

2478
02:25:10,410 --> 02:25:12,703
All it takes is one Judas.

2479
02:25:13,246 --> 02:25:16,581
JIM: A few people on the inside.
Pentagon, CIA.

2480
02:25:16,666 --> 02:25:18,458
This is Louisiana.

2481
02:25:18,918 --> 02:25:23,296
How do you know who your daddy is?
'Cause your mama told you so.

2482
02:25:24,424 --> 02:25:26,883
BILL: You are taking a crap in the wind.

2483
02:25:27,135 --> 02:25:30,053
And I am not going along on this one.

2484
02:25:31,013 --> 02:25:32,305
[Banging]

2485
02:25:40,064 --> 02:25:42,899
I've had my doubts all along about Bill.

2486
02:25:43,443 --> 02:25:45,360
He's been fighting us.

2487
02:25:46,863 --> 02:25:48,238
We need him back.

2488
02:25:48,448 --> 02:25:50,824
OSER: He wasted a month
trying to prove

2489
02:25:50,908 --> 02:25:54,661
that mob boys like Jack Ruby
are hooked up with Hunt Oil.

2490
02:25:54,871 --> 02:25:57,038
LOU: I don't trust him.
JIM: I will not hear this.

2491
02:25:57,123 --> 02:26:00,000
I value Bill as much as any person here.

2492
02:26:01,335 --> 02:26:05,338
It's time we made room
for someone else's ideas, including me.

2493
02:26:06,591 --> 02:26:09,593
Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is,
and I'm

2494
02:26:10,136 --> 02:26:12,053
just plain dumb about it.

2495
02:26:12,138 --> 02:26:14,890
OSER: I've seen him copying files here
late at night.

2496
02:26:14,974 --> 02:26:17,434
LOU: I don't trust him.
JIM: Did you two hear me?

2497
02:26:17,518 --> 02:26:20,228
I won't tolerate staff infighting.

2498
02:26:20,313 --> 02:26:23,648
I'm afraid I cannot work
with Bill Broussard anymore.

2499
02:26:24,942 --> 02:26:26,610
Is this an ultimatum?

2500
02:26:28,279 --> 02:26:29,988
JIM: Are you giving me an ultimatum?

2501
02:26:30,072 --> 02:26:32,282
If that's what you want to call it.

2502
02:26:34,494 --> 02:26:36,661
I never thought it'd come to this.

2503
02:26:40,374 --> 02:26:41,541
I guess I am.

2504
02:26:42,835 --> 02:26:47,547
I won't have any ultimatum put to me, Lou.
I'll accept your resignation.

2505
02:26:51,636 --> 02:26:53,178
You sure got it.

2506
02:26:58,559 --> 02:27:01,186
You are one stubborn son of a bitch.

2507
02:27:03,481 --> 02:27:05,649
LOU: You're making a big mistake.

2508
02:27:12,782 --> 02:27:15,492
SUSIE: Boss, aren't you being a little hard?

2509
02:27:16,744 --> 02:27:18,495
No, I don't think I am.

2510
02:27:20,081 --> 02:27:21,456
Anyone else?

2511
02:27:26,379 --> 02:27:29,172
Now, Jerry, here's Jim Garrison,

2512
02:27:29,715 --> 02:27:32,759
the District Attorney
of New Orleans, Louisiana.

2513
02:27:47,441 --> 02:27:49,693
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison.

2514
02:27:50,027 --> 02:27:54,406
You're investigating the murder
of President Kennedy.

2515
02:27:54,574 --> 02:27:58,034
We have heard some strange things
coming out of your office.

2516
02:27:58,661 --> 02:28:02,372
First, we heard that Cuban exiles
killed the President.

2517
02:28:02,456 --> 02:28:03,915
Then the mob.

2518
02:28:04,125 --> 02:28:08,920
Your latest theory seems to be
that the CIA and the FBl

2519
02:28:09,005 --> 02:28:10,338
and the Pentagon

2520
02:28:10,423 --> 02:28:15,594
and the White House all combined
in an elaborate conspiracy to kill Kennedy.

2521
02:28:17,388 --> 02:28:19,681
Is there anyone
besides Lee Harvey Oswald

2522
02:28:19,765 --> 02:28:22,976
who you think didn't conspire
to kill the President?

2523
02:28:25,521 --> 02:28:27,480
Let's just say this, Jerry,

2524
02:28:28,190 --> 02:28:29,774
I've stopped beating my wife.

2525
02:28:32,069 --> 02:28:35,363
Maybe you should ask Lyndon Johnson.
He has some answers.

2526
02:28:38,784 --> 02:28:42,579
There have been a number of reports
in reputable news media,

2527
02:28:42,872 --> 02:28:45,248
Time, Newsweek, our own NBC,

2528
02:28:45,666 --> 02:28:49,628
that you've gone beyond legal means
as a prosecutor,

2529
02:28:50,546 --> 02:28:53,548
that you've intimidated,
even drugged witnesses,

2530
02:28:53,633 --> 02:28:56,760
bribed them, and urged them
to commit perjury.

2531
02:28:57,511 --> 02:28:58,720
Do you have a response?

2532
02:28:58,846 --> 02:29:01,598
Your faith in the veracity
of the major media is touching.

2533
02:29:02,266 --> 02:29:05,268
It indicates that the age of innocence
is not yet over.

2534
02:29:05,353 --> 02:29:06,937
But ask yourself,

2535
02:29:07,021 --> 02:29:09,940
if we had learned
on November 22, 1963,

2536
02:29:10,024 --> 02:29:13,151
that the Russian Premier had been shot
from a Moscow building

2537
02:29:13,235 --> 02:29:15,195
by a lonely capitalist sympathizer

2538
02:29:15,279 --> 02:29:19,574
who, himself, was then liquidated
by a patriotic Muscovite within 48 hours

2539
02:29:19,659 --> 02:29:21,451
while surrounded by armed police.

2540
02:29:21,535 --> 02:29:23,995
I think it would be apparent to anyone

2541
02:29:24,080 --> 02:29:28,375
that a coup d'tat and a transfer
of power had just taken place.

2542
02:29:28,834 --> 02:29:32,712
And we would not ask questions
or attack Jim Garrison.

2543
02:29:33,047 --> 02:29:35,256
We would, in a free-thinking society,

2544
02:29:35,383 --> 02:29:39,552
be asking why he was killed,
and what forces opposed him.

2545
02:29:39,887 --> 02:29:43,556
There are some people who might say
that you are paranoid.

2546
02:29:43,724 --> 02:29:47,268
I should show you some pictures
so you can understand

2547
02:29:47,520 --> 02:29:49,312
what I'm talking about.

2548
02:29:50,481 --> 02:29:52,065
These are arrests.

2549
02:29:52,483 --> 02:29:56,403
These arrests were photographed
minutes after the assassination.

2550
02:29:56,570 --> 02:29:58,405
They were never shown to the public.

2551
02:29:58,531 --> 02:30:00,740
I'm sorry,
these pictures can't be shown on TV.

2552
02:30:00,825 --> 02:30:03,368
- Sure they can.
- No, I'm sorry. They can't.

2553
02:30:03,786 --> 02:30:06,538
- The camera can pick these up.
- Jim, I'm sorry.

2554
02:30:06,789 --> 02:30:09,749
They can't. We have libel laws.

2555
02:30:10,251 --> 02:30:13,837
Those men you just saw were arrested
in Dallas minutes after the assassination.

2556
02:30:13,921 --> 02:30:15,547
They were never seen again.

2557
02:30:15,631 --> 02:30:18,717
No record of arrest,
no mug shots, no fingerprints.

2558
02:30:19,010 --> 02:30:20,260
Hold that thought.

2559
02:30:20,344 --> 02:30:23,138
We'll be back,
right after these commercials.

2560
02:30:34,316 --> 02:30:36,526
Bill, what the hell are you doing here?

2561
02:30:36,610 --> 02:30:40,780
I'm sorry about the other day.
I didn't mean to walk out on you like that.

2562
02:30:41,741 --> 02:30:44,409
You came all this way
to tell me the obvious?

2563
02:30:44,869 --> 02:30:46,119
No. Look,

2564
02:30:46,495 --> 02:30:50,665
I just heard of an attempt to kill you
between here and New Orleans.

2565
02:30:51,125 --> 02:30:54,461
A mob guy was brought down by Shaw
from Canada.

2566
02:30:54,795 --> 02:30:57,922
This is serious.
You'll need a bodyguard tonight.

2567
02:30:58,549 --> 02:31:02,469
When you were in the Army,
did you ever find out what an order meant?

2568
02:31:02,678 --> 02:31:07,098
Do you remember my orders
about passing on rumors

2569
02:31:07,183 --> 02:31:08,600
about someone going to be killed?

2570
02:31:08,684 --> 02:31:11,061
- Yes, I do, but this is...
- No, there is no "but. "

2571
02:31:11,145 --> 02:31:13,813
There is no "but" in a military situation!

2572
02:31:14,356 --> 02:31:17,484
I don't appreciate you dumping
this paranoid garbage on me,

2573
02:31:17,568 --> 02:31:19,986
nor your inability
to follow a simple order

2574
02:31:20,071 --> 02:31:24,657
especially when it means I have to pay
for your flight back to New Orleans.

2575
02:31:25,242 --> 02:31:26,951
Let's get you a ticket.

2576
02:31:28,579 --> 02:31:31,581
Boss, I'm sorry.
I'm just looking out for you.

2577
02:31:31,957 --> 02:31:33,416
Get a receipt.

2578
02:32:20,756 --> 02:32:22,465
Come on, come on. He's out here.

2579
02:32:22,550 --> 02:32:25,760
Jim, where are you going?
It's me, Samuel.

2580
02:32:34,436 --> 02:32:38,523
- Hey, how long were you in that restroom?
- None of your goddamn business.

2581
02:33:27,740 --> 02:33:30,283
Jim, bad news, Bill's turned.

2582
02:33:30,492 --> 02:33:33,119
I think he's given everything we've got
to the feds.

2583
02:33:33,204 --> 02:33:36,497
We studied the memos
and there was nothing there. Nothing.

2584
02:33:36,582 --> 02:33:40,251
We went to confront him and the landlady
said the son of a bitch just left.

2585
02:33:40,336 --> 02:33:41,711
Left everything.

2586
02:33:42,296 --> 02:33:44,005
It's unbelievable. I'm sorry.

2587
02:33:44,089 --> 02:33:47,008
Mattie, could you get Mr. Garrison
a drink, please?

2588
02:33:47,259 --> 02:33:48,760
Something sure scared him.

2589
02:33:48,844 --> 02:33:52,096
Bill doesn't scare that easy.
Somebody got to his thinking.

2590
02:33:52,181 --> 02:33:55,308
- He was never that good a thinker.
- He sure fooled us.

2591
02:33:56,393 --> 02:33:59,812
No, no, leave it. Don't turn it down.
I want to see this.

2592

02:43:56,451 --> 02:43:58,536
JIM: There's a reason for that.

2747
02:43:59,454 --> 02:44:00,621
Watch.

2748
02:44:50,797 --> 02:44:53,132
JIM: "The picture speaks 1,000 words. "

2749
02:44:54,968 --> 02:44:57,970
The Warren Commission thought they had
an open-and-shut case.

2750
02:44:58,054 --> 02:45:00,180
Three bullets, one assassin.

2751
02:45:01,016 --> 02:45:04,560
Two unpredictable things happened
that day to make it impossible.

2752
02:45:04,644 --> 02:45:10,107
One, the film shot by Abraham Zapruder
while standing near the grassy knoll.

2753
02:45:10,692 --> 02:45:14,695
Two, the third wounded man,
James Teague, nicked by a fragment

2754
02:45:15,196 --> 02:45:17,656
while standing near the triple underpass.

2755
02:45:17,866 --> 02:45:21,577
The time frame, 5.6 seconds,
established by the Zapruder film

2756
02:45:21,828 --> 02:45:24,455
left no possibility of a fourth shot.

2757
02:45:24,706 --> 02:45:28,834
So the shot of fragment that left
a superficial wound on Teague's cheek

2758
02:45:29,210 --> 02:45:33,547
came from one of the three bullets
fired from the Depository's sixth floor.

2759
02:45:34,257 --> 02:45:36,216
That leaves just two bullets.

2760
02:45:36,718 --> 02:45:40,262
We know one was the fatal head shot
that killed Kennedy.

2761
02:45:42,057 --> 02:45:43,891
So a single bullet remains.

2762
02:45:44,142 --> 02:45:48,854
A single bullet must account for the seven
wounds in Kennedy and Connally.

2763
02:45:49,689 --> 02:45:52,775
Rather than admit to a conspiracy
or investigate further,

2764
02:45:52,859 --> 02:45:55,235
the Warren Commission
endorsed the theory

2765
02:45:55,320 --> 02:45:58,781
put forth by an ambitious attorney,
Arlen Spector.

2766
02:45:58,865 --> 02:46:02,368
One of the grossest lies ever forced
on the American people.

2767
02:46:03,912 --> 02:46:06,205
It's known as the "magic bullet" theory.

2768
02:46:07,082 --> 02:46:08,582
The magic bullet

2769
02:46:08,750 --> 02:46:13,170
enters the President's back,
headed downward at a 17-degree angle.

2770
02:46:13,713 --> 02:46:18,467
It then moves upwards to leave Kennedy's
body from the front of his neck,

2771
02:46:19,052 --> 02:46:20,552
wound number 2,

2772
02:46:21,012 --> 02:46:23,097
where it waits 1.6 seconds,

2773
02:46:23,723 --> 02:46:27,685
presumably in midair,
where it turns right, then left

2774
02:46:28,353 --> 02:46:30,396
right, then left,

2775
02:46:30,689 --> 02:46:34,108
and continues
into Connally's right armpit.

2776
02:46:34,401 --> 02:46:35,943
Wound number 3.

2777
02:46:36,361 --> 02:46:41,073
The bullet then heads down at an angle
of 27 degrees, shattering his rib

2778
02:46:41,908 --> 02:46:45,703
and exiting from the right side
of his chest. Wound number 4.

2779
02:46:46,413 --> 02:46:51,083
The bullet turns right, reentering
Connally's body at his right wrist.

2780
02:46:51,793 --> 02:46:53,127
Wound number 5.

2781
02:46:53,795 --> 02:46:55,587
Shattering the radius bone,

2782
02:46:55,755 --> 02:46:58,674
the bullet exits Connally's wrist,
wound number 6,

2783
02:46:59,175 --> 02:47:03,762
makes a dramatic U-turn,
then buries itself in Connally's left thigh.

2784
02:47:04,097 --> 02:47:07,057
Wound number 7,
from which it later falls out

2785
02:47:07,600 --> 02:47:10,352
and is found
in almost pristine condition

2786
02:47:10,770 --> 02:47:13,939
on a stretcher in a corridor
of Parkland Hospital.

2787
02:47:16,359 --> 02:47:17,818
Some bullet.

2788
02:47:19,529 --> 02:47:22,698
Any combat vet can tell you,
never in the history of gunfire

2789
02:47:22,782 --> 02:47:25,451
has there been a bullet this ridiculous.

2790
02:47:26,327 --> 02:47:31,165
The government says it can prove it
with some fancy physics in a nuclear lab.

2791
02:47:31,666 --> 02:47:33,125
Of course they can.

2792

Theoretical physics can prove
an elephant can hang from a cliff

But use your eyes, your common sense.

2796
02:47:42,761 --> 02:47:46,972
The Army wound ballistics experts
fired some comparison bullets.

2797
02:47:47,557 --> 02:47:50,142
Not one of them looked anything like this.

Take a look at CE-856.

2799
02:47:54,773 --> 02:47:56,440
An identical bullet

2800
02:47:56,608 --> 02:47:59,443
fired through the wrist
of a human cadaver,

2801
02:48:00,028 --> 02:48:03,363
just one of the bones smashed
by the magic bullet.

2802
02:48:04,157 --> 02:48:05,991
Seven wounds, gentlemen.

2803
02:48:06,076 --> 02:48:07,409
Tough skin,

2804
02:48:07,869 --> 02:48:09,286
dense bones.

2805
02:48:10,663 --> 02:48:12,915
This single-bullet explanation

2806
02:48:12,999 --> 02:48:17,127
is the foundation of the Warren
Commission's claim of one assassin.

2807
02:48:17,545 --> 02:48:19,004
And once you conclude

2808
02:48:19,089 --> 02:48:22,091
the magic bullet couldn't create
all seven wounds

2809
02:48:22,342 --> 02:48:26,386
you must conclude there was
a fourth shot and a second rifleman.

[Dramatic instrumental music]

And if there was a second rifleman,

2812
02:48:30,642 --> 02:48:33,977
then by definition there had
to be a conspiracy

involves the accused, Clay Shaw.

Twenty-six trained medical personnel

There was a large 7 cm opening
at the right occipital parietal area.

A considerable portion
of the brain was missing.

MCCLELLAND: A fifth or possibly
a quarter of the back of the head

2834
02:50:01,774 --> 02:50:03,108
had been blasted out

attached to a flap of the scalp.

2839
02:50:12,911 --> 02:50:16,914
The exit hole in the rear of his head
measured about 120 mm,

2840
02:50:17,248 --> 02:50:18,790
or five inches, across.

JIM: Not one of the civilian doctors
who examined the President

2842
02:50:23,171 --> 02:50:26,465
regarded his throat wound as anything
but an entry wound.

2843

But then the body was illegally moved
to Washington for the autopsy.

Because when a coup d'tat has occurred

there's a big difference between
an autopsy performed by civilian doctors

ADMIRAL KENNEY: It isn't our business

2899
02:53:10,671 --> 02:53:13,590
to discuss this with anyone
outside this room.

2900
02:53:13,674 --> 02:53:16,676
As I recall, Admiral Kenney,
Navy Surgeon General,

2901
02:53:17,011 --> 02:53:19,971
specifically told us
not to discuss the case.

2902
02:53:23,101 --> 02:53:26,395
JIM: A lot of people were deciding
what was private,

2903
02:53:26,687 --> 02:53:29,272
none of the American people's business.

2904
02:53:29,482 --> 02:53:31,441
The chief pathologist, Commander Humes

2905
02:53:31,526 --> 02:53:35,237
by his own admission,
voluntarily burned his autopsy notes.

President Johnson orders
the blood-soaked limousine

2907
02:53:38,282 --> 02:53:41,993
filled with bullet holes and clues
to be washed and rebuilt.

2908
02:53:42,203 --> 02:53:45,330
He sends Connally's bloody suit
to the cleaners.

2909
02:53:46,207 --> 02:53:50,544
The Justice Department denied this office
access to the autopsy photos.

2910
02:53:51,295 --> 02:53:55,674
When we finally get a court order
to examine Kennedy's brain

2911
02:53:56,092 --> 02:53:59,636
in the hopes of finding
from which direction the bullet came,

2912
02:53:59,720 --> 02:54:01,054
we're told,

2913
02:54:01,889 --> 02:54:05,892
by your government that
the President's brain has disappeared.

2914

[Jury murmurs]

2915
02:54:09,272 --> 02:54:12,899
JIM: That's not all that's disappeared.
With it, the concept ofjustice.

2916
02:54:12,984 --> 02:54:17,571
DYMOND: Objection. Mr. Garrison is
insulting the federal government...

2917
02:54:18,156 --> 02:54:19,781
JUDGE: Overruled!

2918
02:54:26,873 --> 02:54:29,332
So, what really happened that day?

2919
02:54:29,584 --> 02:54:32,502
Let's just for a moment speculate,
shall we?

2920
02:54:32,670 --> 02:54:34,838
We have the epileptic seizure

2921
02:54:35,590 --> 02:54:39,718
distracting the police and allowing
the shooters to get into place.

2922
02:54:40,595 --> 02:54:44,723
The epileptic later vanished,
never checking into the hospital.

2923
02:54:45,933 --> 02:54:49,060
The A-team goes to the sixth floor
of the Depository.

2924
02:54:49,187 --> 02:54:51,813
They were refurbishing the floors
of the Depository that week,

2925
02:54:51,898 --> 02:54:54,649
allowing unknown workmen
in the building.

[Orders given over radio]

2927
02:54:55,860 --> 02:54:59,362
JIM: They move quickly into position,
minutes before the shooting.

2928
02:54:59,822 --> 02:55:04,409
The second spotter, talking by radio to
the other teams, has the best overall view.

2929
02:55:05,036 --> 02:55:06,286
The God spot.

2930

B- team, one rifleman and one spotter
with access to the building

2931
02:55:11,709 --> 02:55:14,628
moves into a low floor
of the Dal-Tex building.

2932
02:55:15,630 --> 02:55:20,550
The third team, C-team, moves in
behind the fence above the grassy knoll

2933
02:55:20,760 --> 02:55:25,013
where the shooter and the spotter
are first seen by the late Lee Bowers.

2934
02:55:26,098 --> 02:55:28,099
They have the best position.

2935
02:55:28,643 --> 02:55:31,770
Kennedy is close and on a flat,
low trajectory.

2936
02:55:32,480 --> 02:55:34,314
Part of this team is a coordinator

2937
02:55:34,398 --> 02:55:38,527
who flashed security credentials
at people, chasing them from the area.

Probably two to three more men
are in the crowd.

2940
02:55:43,908 --> 02:55:47,577
Ten to twelve men.
Three teams. Three shooters.

The triangulation of fire Clay Shaw and
David Ferrie discussed two months before.

02:55:53,793 --> 02:55:55,627
They blocked the plaza.

2943
02:55:55,920 --> 02:55:57,712
They know every inch.

2944
02:55:59,674 --> 02:56:03,468
They've calibrated their sights.
Practiced on moving targets.

2945
02:56:04,512 --> 02:56:05,762
They're ready.

2946
02:56:06,681 --> 02:56:10,225
Kennedy's motorcade makes a turn
from Main onto Houston.

2947
02:56:10,851 --> 02:56:12,936
It's going to be a turkey shoot.

2948
02:56:14,647 --> 02:56:16,690
They don't shoot him on Houston,

2949
02:56:16,774 --> 02:56:20,318
the easiest shot for a single shooter
in the Depository.

2950
02:56:20,528 --> 02:56:24,281
They wait till he gets to the killing zone
between three rifles.

2951
02:56:25,616 --> 02:56:28,660
Kennedy makes the turn
from Houston onto Elm.

2952
02:56:29,579 --> 02:56:32,872
Slowing down to some 11 miles an hour.

2953
02:56:33,541 --> 02:56:37,377
The shooters across Dealey Plaza tighten,
taking their aim.

2954
02:56:39,213 --> 02:56:42,340
Waiting for the radio to say,
"Green! Green!"

2955
02:56:43,301 --> 02:56:45,552
Or, "Abort! Abort!"

Sounding like a backfire,
it misses the car completely.

02:56:58,274 --> 02:57:01,359
Frame 161, Kennedy stops waving
as he hears something.

2961
02:57:02,028 --> 02:57:04,696
Connally's head turns slightly to the right.

Frame 193, the second shot hits Kennedy
in the throat from the front.

Frame 225, Kennedy emerges
from behind the road sign.

to his throat.

pulling him downward and forward.

Connally, you will notice,
shows no sign of being hit.

02:57:27,094 --> 02:57:31,139
He is holding his Stetson, which is
impossible if his wrist is shattered.

Connally yells, "My God!

in the second-floor snack room.

neatly side-by-side in the firing nest,

wipes fingerprints off the rifle,
stashes it on the other side of the loft,

past Victoria Adams and Sandra Styles
who never see him,

second floor in front of Patrolman Baker.

Oswald is free to leave the building.

Among them, Clay Shaw, here before you.

3201
03:11:04,411 --> 03:11:07,705
It was a public execution,
and it was covered up by

3202
03:11:07,789 --> 03:11:10,749
like-minded people in the Dallas Police,

3203
03:11:10,834 --> 03:11:13,919
the Secret Service, the FBl,
and the White House,

3204
03:11:14,254 --> 03:11:17,298
up to and including J. Edgar Hoover,
and Lyndon Johnson

[Crowd murmurs]

3206

who were accomplices after the fact.

3207
03:11:21,595 --> 03:11:25,556
The assassination reduced the President
to a transient official.

3208
03:11:26,224 --> 03:11:31,562
His job is to speak as often as possible
of the nation's desire for peace

3209
03:11:32,147 --> 03:11:34,815
while he acts as a business agent
in the Congress

3210
03:11:34,900 --> 03:11:36,984
for the military and their contractors.

3211
03:11:39,321 --> 03:11:41,363
Some people say I'm crazy.

[Crowd chuckles]

Southern caricature seeking higher office.

3214
03:11:48,121 --> 03:11:50,873
There's a simple way to determine
if I am paranoid.

3215
03:11:51,583 --> 03:11:54,251
Ask the two men who profited most
from the assassination,

3216
03:11:54,336 --> 03:11:58,255
former President Johnson
and your new President, Nixon,

3217
03:11:58,465 --> 03:12:03,219
to release the 51 CIA documents
pertaining to Lee Oswald and Jack Ruby.

3218
03:12:04,137 --> 03:12:05,888
Or the secret CIA memo

3219
03:12:05,972 --> 03:12:09,850
on Oswald's activities in Russia that
was destroyed while being photocopied.

3220
03:12:10,477 --> 03:12:12,520
These documents are yours.

3221
03:12:13,063 --> 03:12:15,689
The people's property. You pay for it.

3222
03:12:16,233 --> 03:12:18,359
But as the government sees you
as children

3223
03:12:18,443 --> 03:12:21,570
who might be too disturbed
to face this reality

3224
03:12:22,322 --> 03:12:25,115
or because you might lynch
those involved,

3225
03:12:26,076 --> 03:12:29,245
you cannot see these documents
for another 75 years.

3226
03:12:30,247 --> 03:12:31,914
I'm in my 40s

3227
03:12:33,124 --> 03:12:36,043
so I'll have "shuffled off
this mortal coil" by then.

3228
03:12:36,127 --> 03:12:40,548
But I'm telling my eight-year-old son
to keep himself physically fit

3229
03:12:41,466 --> 03:12:45,469
so that one glorious September morning,
in 2038,

3230
03:12:45,554 --> 03:12:50,307
he can go to the National Archives
and learn what the CIA and FBl knew.

3231
03:12:52,018 --> 03:12:53,477
They may push it back then.

3232
03:12:53,562 --> 03:12:59,233
It may become a generational affair.
Questions passed from parent to child.

3233
03:12:59,401 --> 03:13:03,445
But someday, somewhere,
someone may find out the damn truth.

3234
03:13:04,406 --> 03:13:05,531
We better.

3235
03:13:06,658 --> 03:13:10,369
Or we might just as well build ourselves
another government

3236
03:13:10,829 --> 03:13:15,291
like the Declaration of Independence
says to, when the old one don't work.

3237
03:13:15,375 --> 03:13:17,084
Just a bit farther out West.

3238
03:13:18,878 --> 03:13:20,879
An American naturalist wrote,

3239
03:13:21,172 --> 03:13:24,425
"A patriot must always be ready
to defend his country

3240
03:13:24,718 --> 03:13:26,677
"against its government. "

3241
03:13:28,179 --> 03:13:30,681
I'd hate to be in your shoes today.

3242
03:13:31,141 --> 03:13:35,686
You have a lot to think about. You've seen
evidence the public hasn't seen.

3243
03:13:36,896 --> 03:13:39,440
Going back to when we were children,

3244
03:13:40,108 --> 03:13:44,862
I think most of us in this courtroom
thought justice came automatically.

3245
03:13:46,031 --> 03:13:48,115
That virtue was its own reward.

3246
03:13:48,199 --> 03:13:50,367
That good triumphs over evil.

3247
03:13:51,286 --> 03:13:54,204
But as we get older
we know this isn't true.

3248
03:13:55,081 --> 03:13:59,251
Individual human beings have to create
justice, and this is not easy

3249
03:14:00,712 --> 03:14:03,839
because the truth often poses a threat
to power,

3250
03:14:04,215 --> 03:14:07,051
and one often has to fight power
at great risk to themselves.

3251
03:14:08,053 --> 03:14:10,054
People like S.M. Holland,

3252
03:14:10,555 --> 03:14:11,889
Lee Bowers,

3253
03:14:12,432 --> 03:14:14,266
Jean Hill, Willie O'Keefe,

3254
03:14:14,351 --> 03:14:17,770
have all taken that risk
and they've all come forward.

3255
03:14:17,937 --> 03:14:20,731
I have here some $8,000 in these letters

3256
03:14:21,650 --> 03:14:23,942
sent from all over the country.

3257
03:14:24,277 --> 03:14:26,945
Quarters, dimes, dollars from housewives

3258
03:14:27,614 --> 03:14:30,449
plumbers, car salesmen,
teachers, invalids.

3259
03:14:31,660 --> 03:14:35,079
These are people who cannot afford
to send money but do.

3260
03:14:35,997 --> 03:14:37,873
People who drive cabs,

3261
03:14:38,458 --> 03:14:40,084
who nurse in hospitals,

3262
03:14:40,168 --> 03:14:42,586
who see their kids go to Vietnam.

3263
03:14:43,880 --> 03:14:44,922
Why?

3264
03:14:46,549 --> 03:14:48,217
Because they care.

3265
03:14:48,968 --> 03:14:50,636
Because they want to know the truth.

3266
03:14:51,846 --> 03:14:53,847
Because they want their country back.

3267
03:14:53,932 --> 03:14:56,225
Because it still belongs to us,

3268
03:14:56,434 --> 03:15:00,688
as long as the people have the guts
to fight for what they believe in.

3269
03:15:02,941 --> 03:15:06,860
The truth is the most important value
we have because if it doesn't endure,

3270
03:15:08,279 --> 03:15:09,697
if the government murders truth,

3271
03:15:09,781 --> 03:15:12,241
if we cannot respect these people

3272
03:15:12,325 --> 03:15:17,246
then this is not the country I was born in,
or the country I want to die in.

than for John F. Kennedy,
