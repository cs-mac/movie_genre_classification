Hello, welcome.

20
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,800
These are free samples. Do you want to try them?

21
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,800
If you have children, you can pick the milder one. It's very nutritious.

22
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,000
It contains all sorts of minerals.

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,200
- Does it taste good?<br>- <i>Huizhen, we are too busy. Come help!</i>

24
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,000
Okay!

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
If you need any assistance, call for our staff.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,100
Thank you for visiting our store!

28
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,800
Thank you!

29
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,100
I'm coming!

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,400
- Hello?<br>- Li Huizhen!

31
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,400
Why are you still not here? Are you coming?

32
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,600
Babe, I-I'll be right there. I'm working the night shift.

33
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,200
I can only leave work at 10 p.m.

34
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,800
I order you to

35
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,200
come to my side immediately! Do you hear me？

36
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,800
Qiao'er, what are you saying? I can't hear you clearly.

37
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,500
What did you say?

38
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,000
I know! I'll go find you right after work, okay?

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,900
Be good, be good. Don't drink too much.

40
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,800
Happy birthday!

41
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
Happy birthday.

42
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,200
Happy birthday!

43
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,200
- This is from you?<br>- <i>Yes, do you like it?</i>

44
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,600
This cake is pretty,

45
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,800
but I remember telling you all that

46
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,200
I only eat the cake that one certain person gives to me, nobody else's.

47
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,000
In the future, don't buy me cakes for my birthday.

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,800
But seeing how pretty this cake is,

49
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,000
everyone can split it. Don't waste it.

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,800
- Good!<br>- Good!

51
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,600
Xia Qiao, I privately ordered this gift from France.

52
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,300
It's for you. Do you like it?

53
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,200
Thank you.

54
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,200
Qiao, look at mine. It's a limited edition.

55
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,400
And mine!

56
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,400
I especially asked a designer to design this gift for you.

57
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,600
Don't compliment yourself.

58
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Let's mix our gifts together and see which one Xia Qiao likes.

59
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,000
That's true capability.

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
- No problem.<br>- Okay!

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,400
Happy birthday.

62
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,700
<i>[Her]</i>

63
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,000
Today is my birthday.

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Everyone, drink to your heart's content!

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,600
Cheers!

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,400
Excuse me.

67
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,600
Was a very pretty girl with short hair having a birthday party here?

68
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,800
They just left. They had a lot of fun. I don't know where they went.

69
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,400
Did... Did they already go home, or...

70
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,800
Oh, my god! You...

71
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,000
- I can't believe somebody answered.<br>- Look!

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,600
Look at the time! Look at your watch, okay?

73
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,200
I'll look. Currently, it's 1 a.m... A little past 1 a.m.

74
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,600
- Be careful.<br>- I don't even want to scold you anymore.

75
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,200
I called you so many times. Why did you only come now?

76
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,600
Oh, my. You're seriously...

77
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,400
Where are the others? Didn't you invite a bunch of people for your birthday?

78
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,200
I told them to leave.

79
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,600
Then, were you waiting for me?

80
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,200
No.

81
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,400
I was waiting for the cake.

82
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
The cake is here. Look.

83
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,600
I'll show you the cake that I had custom-made.

84
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,000
It has your favorite candy on top.

85
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,200
Do you still have room in your stomach for my cake?

86
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,600
In order to eat this cake,

87
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,400
I just threw up all the food that I ate tonight.

88
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,400
What are you doing?

89
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,000
Will you eat here or somewhere else?

90
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,200
I'll hug it as I sleep.

91
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,800
You can't hug it and sleep. We need to go home.

92
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,000
Let's eat at home, okay?

93
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
Get my cake.

94
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,200
You can't ruin the appearance. Wait a second, okay?

95
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,400
Happy birthday to me!

96
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,600
Xia Qiao, happy birthday!

97
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,700
Qiao'er, happy birthday!

98
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:02,400
Happy birthday to you.

99
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,500
Happy birthday to me.

100
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,900
I'm tired from playing.

101
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,600
Happy birthday, Qiao'er.

102
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Thank you, my dear Zhen'er.

103
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,400
Make a wish.

104
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,700
Done.

105
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,400
Blow out the candles.

106
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,700
I won't blow them.

107
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,000
You haven't blown out the candles yet. How will you eat the cake?

108
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,700
Open the door. I don't have the keys.

109
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,600
What's wrong? Why are you suddenly unhappy?

110
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,100
You haven't even blown out the candles yet.

111
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,400
Anyway, the wish that I make

112
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,800
has never come true before.

113
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,400
It's the same whether or not I blow them out.

114
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,000
<i>My mom and Xia Qiao's mom were once best friends.</i>

115
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,800
<i>They got married on the same year,</i>

116
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,000
<i>and gave birth to me and Xia Qiao on the same year.</i>

117
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,800
<i>We were once neighbors, and grew up together like sisters.</i>

118
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,400
<i>You can say that we've been friends since we were in the womb.</i>

119
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:01,800
<i>Later, many things happened to my family and Xia Qiao's family.</i>

120
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,800
<i>Our lives</i>

121
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,800
<i>became different than we had always imagined,</i>

122
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,000
<i>but we became the closest sisters.</i>

123
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,400
<i>I'm constantly unemployed,</i>

124
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,600
<i>afraid to tell my family.</i>

125
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,400
<i>Xia Qiao allowed me to live in her house,</i>

126
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,600
<i>just like how we often lived together when we were little.</i>

127
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,600
<i>I love this house</i>

128
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,400
<i>and I love this dear sister.</i>

129
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,400
<i>I hope that she can have more and more happiness and love.</i>

130
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,000
Good morning, beautiful day!

131
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,200
Mrs. Wang!

132
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,400
Healthily grow up!

133
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,400
Spin, spin, spin...

134
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,700
<i>Qiao'er!</i>

135
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,300
<i>The wolf is coming, Qiao'er!</i>

136
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,400
<i>Qiao'er!</i>

137
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,800
Qiao'er!

138
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,700
Qiao'er!

139
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,000
The sun is out!

140
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,200
The sun is gone again!

141
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,000
Li Huizhen,

142
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I hate seeing you every morning.

143
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,800
So? Do I look pretty?

144
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,830
You look good in anything.

145
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,000
Don't you have an interview today? Why are you still washing the dishes?

146
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,600
Stop washing; I'll wash them. Go change your clothes.

147
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,800
I'll feel more at ease if I leave after washing the dishes.

148
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,000
So? Do you have confidence in today's interview?

149
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,800
The more interviews, the less confident I feel, but what can I do?

150
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,000
I really want to work overtime so much that my nose starts bleeding,

151
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,100
but I don't have a chance.

152
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,600
If you're my friend,

153
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,800
you can't give up. You must have confidence!

154
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,000
Relax.

155
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,200
If they don't hire you, it's because they don't have good taste.

156
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,200
But if they really don't hire you,

157
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,000
don't worry. You still have me.

158
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,600
I'll raise you.

159
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,950
Stop! Stop with your puppy eyes. I'm going to work.

160
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,000
Oh, right. Hurry to my room and pick a suitable set of clothes, purse, and shoes.

161
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,200
You must pay attention to your outer appearance in an interview like this.

162
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,800
- Good luck!<br>- Good luck!

163
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,000
Our Huizhen is the cutest!

164
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,610
- Good luck!<br>- Good luck!

165
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,800
Qiao'er!

166
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,800
What's wrong? W-What else are you worrying about?

167
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,800
I'm not worried.

168
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,000
I will bring out my best mode today!

169
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,800
- Good luck!<br>- Good luck!

170
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,200
- Bye-bye.<br>- Bye-bye!

171
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,800
This?

172
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,200
Why does it look different than when Qiao'er wears it?

Good morning!

Be careful.

177
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,800
I'm sorry, but the elevator is full.

178
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,200
It's full.

- Close the door.<br>- Are there stairs here?

180
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,400
Turn right, walk straight forward, and take another turn.

181

- Okay, thank you.<br>- Close the door. Quickly.

It's here.

189
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:23,400
Hello, everyone. I am number 689, Chen Fei. I graduated from Shanghai International Studies University.

190
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,000
I used to work at Booking. This is my resume.

191
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,200
Number 690, Li Huizhen.

192
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,600
Here!

193
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,600
I've never heard of your school before.

194
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,200
Is it a full-time school?

195
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,000
Yes. University of Wenying an ordinary, third-tier private university.

196
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,600
The teachers there are very friendly and amiable. Their teaching is also great.

197
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,400
This level of education is enough for a trainee.

198
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,400
You're not young anymore, so why are you wanting to become a trainee?

199
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,300
It's because the requirements for normal employees are too high.

200
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,900
You're quite honest.

201
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,200
Yes, that's my biggest merit.

202
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,200
All my previous bosses complimented me that I'm very honest and willing to work hard.

203
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,000
Also, I'm very strong.

204
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,200
But why did you switch jobs so frequently?

205
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,000
You haven't worked at any workplaces for over one year.

206
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,200
This is actually because...

207
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,200
It's quite strange.

208
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,000
I don't know why, but whenever I work at a certain company,

209
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,800
that company will go bankrupt soon after,

210
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,600
so... if your company hired me,

211
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,000
I will become this company's longest-serving employee.

212
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Then, our magazine company will be under a lot of pressure.

213
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I wonder if we can handle you.

214
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,600
Next up, everyone will answer one question.

215
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,400
Look around at your fellow interviewees.

216
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,000
Talk about their strengths and weaknesses.

217
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,700
I'll go.

218
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,800
I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.

219
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,600
I'll talk about number 689, who is sitting next to me.

220
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,800
I think

221
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,200
she is very articulate, coherent, and graceful.

222
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,600
She is also pretty.

223
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,390
Her weakness is...

224
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:12,000
I don't think she has any weaknesses. She's very good.

225
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,200
Interviewee number 690's weakness is

226
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,400
that she doesn't have a responsible attitude.

227
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,000
In our modern society,

228
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,400
outer appearance is also a field of competition.

229
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,200
Her hair and outfit don't appear to be organized.

230
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,300
I think this shows her irresponsibility.

231
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,800
Because I highly value this interview,

232
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,400
I wore clothes that show my personality.

233
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,400
Actually, my good friend picked out

234
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,000
many pretty clothes for me, but I think

235
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,600
I should face you interviewers with my truest appearance.

236
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,200
That's why I wore these clothes here.

237
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,400
I also picked them out myself.

238
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,400
Then, what do you think number 690's strengths are?

239
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,100
Strengths?

240
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,850
Her strength is...

241
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,290
Okay, that's good.

Hello, Qiao'er?

260
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,400
How was today? Was it successful?

261
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,500
Did you meet people who appreciate you?

262
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,100
How should I put this?

263
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,800
That building was too dignified.

264
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:38,000
I feel like the employees and interviewees there are great.

265
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,200
Compared to them, I'm quite lacking.

266
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,400
I need to continue working hard.

267
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,600
Did you listen to me and dress very fashionable?

268
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,600
I think I dressed pretty well today,

269
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,000
but I have a question that I've never understood.

270
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,600
What is fashion?

271
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,200
<i>Is there a standard?</i>

272
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,600
There are no scores, so how will you calculate fashion?

273
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,800
Sometimes, I feel pretty good about myself,

274
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,200
but other people laugh at me.

275
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,600
Why are there two extremes?

276
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,200
Forget it. Don't worry about being fashionable.

277
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,200
Be yourself. Don't force yourself.

278
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,000
Qiao'er, you understand me well.

279
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,600
What are you doing?

280
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,000
Are you wandering around?

281
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
If only I can return to my childhood.

282
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,200
<i>Are you wanting to escape from reality again?</i>

283
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,600
<i>I'm telling you, you're not allowed to be embarrassing.</i>

284
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,500
Many things that are far away disappeared so quickly.

285
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,200
Don't worry. With me here,

286
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,200
our childhood will be here.

287
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,000
I will execute it until the end.

288
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,200
Okay! Promise?

289
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,700
Seal.

290
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,000
What's wrong with you today?

291
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,200
Usually, you're quite unashamed. It's not your first time being rejected.

292
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,800
<i>Why do you sound so upset today?</i>

293
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,400
After walking a while, hurry and go home!

294
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,200
People like you need to be dealt with simple roughness.

295
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,900
I got it. Bye-bye.

298
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,000
Somebody's there.

299

300
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,500
What are you doing?

301
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,800
Stop looking.

302
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,000
Why is he a different man from last week again?

303
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,500
I need to change boyfriends as fast as you change jobs.

304
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,400
That way, we'll be compatible.

305

Why did you come home so soon today? Wait.

306
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,400
Am I the type of person to abandon friends for love?

307
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,000
I even ordered crayfish and soybeans for you today!

Let's go, let's go.

309

The people at the interview had such great qualities.

310
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,130
I can't compare to them.

311
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,400
Their good qualities are only on the outside.

312
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,400
Only your good qualities are inside.

313
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,200
It'd be so great if you can interview for me.

314
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,000
Nobody can compare to you.

Now that I think about it, what happened to you today?

317
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,900
Does seeing me now make you feel very happy?

318
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,200
I'm so happy that it has reached my head!

319
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,800
Can't you see how happy I am?

320
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,600
Why aren't you thanking me?

321
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,400
Whenever you date and find a boyfriend,

322
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,000
are you sincere every time?

323
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,600
No! Sincerity is too hard.

324
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,600
It's hard for others to sincerely love me, and I'm afraid to sincerely love others.

325
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,200
Hence, I think

326
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,010
happiness is easier to find than sincerity.

327
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,970
It also makes me happier than sincerity can,

328
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:49,360
so I want happiness.

329
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,800
I don't want sincerity.

330
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,000
Won't you be even happier with sincerity?

331
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,600
Sincerity can make people sad.

332
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,000
With what you said, is love easy or complex?

333
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
How many times have I told you before?

334
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,800
What I have is not called love.

335
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,000
It is only dating. Understand?

336
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,700
Then, I don't want dating. I want love.

337
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,600
You always tell me that you want love.

338
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,120
Then, tell me,

339
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,100
in your heart, what is love?

340
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:31,600
<i>Love is when you miss the other person when you can't see him.</i>

341
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,400
When you see him, you never want to part from him.

342
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,600
I'm willing to do anything for him,

343
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,900
and he's also willing to do anything for me.

344
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:44,000
Stop! You've never dated before, so you don't have the right to speak.

345
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,800
When you've truly dated somebody, you'll realize

346
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,200
that there is one basic condition.

347
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,000
What is it?

348
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,400
When you're tired of him, it's better not to see him.

349
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,800
After not seeing him for a long time,

350
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,400
you'll find that

351
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,600
you don't even remember his existence.

352
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,400
<i>I don't know what love is, either.</i>

353
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:08,000
<i>Compared to love, I'd rather return to my childhood.</i>

354
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,600
<i>My love has actually always been there.</i>

355
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,000
<i>It's just unwilling to grow up</i>

356
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,600
<i>because growing up means that love</i>

357
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,400
<i>has to be defined as seeing and being with each other.</i>

358
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,600
Come downstairs. Didn't you want to learn yoga?

359
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,380
I'll teach you.

360
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,000
No, I still have to write a cover letter.

361
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:37,000
You don't need to search for a job anymore.

362
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,600
You can specialize in helping people write cover letters.

363
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,600
I'll help you pull in customers. I promise it'll earn you money.

364
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,200
Can you be kinder?

365
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,900
Then, I'm leaving.

366
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
<i>Li Huizhen, hello.</i>

367
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
<i>I am Bai Haoyu.</i>

368
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,800
Qiao'er! Qiao'er! Guess who found me, Qiao'er!

369
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,600
Qiao'er, look!

370
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,200
We haven't talked in such a long time.

371
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,000
I thought he would never be able to find me again!

372
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
It's been 12 years. 12 years already!

373
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,200
How did he find me?

374
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,200
Do you know who I'm talking about?

375
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,600
No.

376
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,800
You still haven't told me who he is.

377
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,200
Bai Haoyu!

378
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,200
That white and chubby Bai Haoyu from next door.

379
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,800
That chubby one, Little Fatty.

380
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,800
He's white and chubby.

381
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,600
I think I remember him.

382
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,500
White and chubby, and was often bullied as a kid.

383
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,800
You don't seem to remember him very well,

384
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,400
but he's my good friend. Later, didn't your family move?

385
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,400
That's why you didn't see him very often.

386
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,800
That's all? Can you stop nagging about it to me?

387
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,600
It's not simple. Look, look.

388
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,200
"I am Bai Haoyu.

389
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,200
I have come back to China. I want to meet up with you, period."

390
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,700
He's back to China and he wants to see me!

391
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,300
Meet him, then.

392
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,200
But in 12...

393
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,200
In 12 years, this'll be my first time seeing him.

394
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,610
So what?

395
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:49,170
If you want to see him, go see him. If you don't, then don't.

396
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,000
It's so simple.

397
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,600
This Little Fatty is very important to me.

398
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,830
What did you say?

399
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,200
You said that Little Fatty is very important to you?

400

you also agreed to meet with him.

these 12 years in America.

443
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,300
I wonder if he's been living happily.

No, I must escort you there.

Oh, my god. She's already touching him.

Turn around. Let me see.

00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,400
You haven't changed at all! You're still so chubby.

00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,000
You're quite fashionable!

479
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,200
Of course.

480
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,400
This scenery is pretty, right?

481
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,400
That's right. Look at how bright Oriental Pearl Tower is.

482
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,200
It's not like you've never seen it before.

483
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,400
Really? It's because you're here.

484
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,600
Little Fatty, you're so good with words now!

485
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,200
<i>- You've become bad!<br>- No way.</i>

486
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,600
- Are you hungry?<br>- I am.

487
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,600
- Let's go eat while we chat, then. <br>- Okay, okay.

488
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,800
Let's go.

489
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,000
Do you like-- Do you really like the scenery here?

490
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,180
It's okay. We can talk here.

491
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,200
Tell me what you usually like to eat.

492
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,400
When I'm hungry, I'd eat anything.

493
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,600
You're so easy to raise!

494
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,400
How annoying.

495
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,500
<i>I heard Ms. Xu say that...</i>

496
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,200
- That's more normal.<br>- <i>You don't like to eat things with wings.</i>

497
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,000
Then... Let's go eat seafood!

498
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,800
Okay! We'll go eat seafood.

499
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,300
Okay!

500
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,000
Who's Ms. Xu?

501
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,800
Isn't Ms. Xu your dad's classmate?

502
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,400
I'm telling you, my cousin and his wife

503
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,900
met each other through Ms. Xu.

504
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,600
- I think we're...<br>- Actually, I think

505
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:25,000
we're quite compatible.

506
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,800
See, you're an extrovert,

507
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,800
and I'm an introvert. It's nice.

508
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,400
Actually, I think you're different from other girls.

509
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,800
The first time I saw you, I felt you're a very honest person.

510
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,200
You're very simple. Let's talk while we eat, okay? Let's go.

511
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,000
Excuse me.

512
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,600
Bai Haoyu?

513
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,800
Where are you? I think I've got the wrong person.

514
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,200
Hello?

515
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,900
Breaking up is breaking up. Don't you understand?

516
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:03,990
Huizhen, where are you?

517
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,100
I'm walking towards the red bridge that you mentioned.

518
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,200

520

- I'm... <br>- Stand in the same spot and don't move. I'll definitely find you.

532
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,400
Are you really not Xu Weiwei?

533
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,200
I'm Li Huizhen.

534
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,400
Li Huizhen?

00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,490
What did you say?

539
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,800
I said, you're still the same as when you were little.

540
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,900
In a crowd of people, I recognized you with one glance.

541
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,900
You...

542
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,500
Let me pick up a call.

543
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:40,000
Hello? What's the situation over there?

544
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,900
No. Qiao'er, I need to tell you something.

545
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,800
I'm telling you,

546
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:54,000
I just dumped one, and another fan came.

547
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,800
This fan is quite handsome!

548
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,200
The "fan" across from you is Bai Haoyu.

549
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,200
- What did you say?<br>- That person is Bai Haoyu.

550
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
No, but... Who was that chubby person from earlier?

551
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
That chubby person? I got the wrong person!

552
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
That wasn't Bai Haoyu. The person across from you is Bai Haoyu.

553
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,600
<i>Keep your voice down.</i>

554
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,800
No, but... Then...

555
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,800
Then... Then, what do I do?

556
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,400
Y-You mustn't tell him

557
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,000
that you're not Li Huizhen.

558
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,800
What did you say?

559
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,600
I meant, first pretend to be Li Huizhen!

560
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,000
Don't tell him that you're not Li Huizhen right now.

561
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,800
You want me to pretend to be you?

562
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,600
I'm not you! How will I take your place?

563
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,200
I don't know what happened between you two when you were younger.

564
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,600
What if I expose myself--

565
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,800
I'm begging you. I'll explain it to you afterwards, okay?

566
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,400
First pretend to be Li Huizhen.

567
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,500
Don't let him... Don't let him look over here.

568
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,000
I'm begging you. Promise me, okay?

569
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,800
Qiao'er, I'm begging you. Qiao'er!

570
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Fine. I'll think of something.

571
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Good luck.

572
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,500
Thank you, Qiao'er. Good luck.

573
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:15,200
You're here.

574
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,580
Well...

575
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,590
If you're not used to calling me Bai Haoyu,

576
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:22,630
you can still call me Fatty like you did before.

577
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,400
Have you been well recently?

578
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,600
As you can see, I'm fine.

579
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,600
Is your family okay?

580
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,400
They're fine.

581
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,400
I can't believe how much you've changed.

582
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,000
Also... I almost didn't recognize you.

583
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
In my opinion, you haven't changed much.

584
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,800
You're the same as when you were younger.

585
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,800
Oh, my god! Right, right, right.

586
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,200
Just now, didn't I pick up a call?

587
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,400
The call told me that there's an emergency, so I need to leave right away.

588
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,800
I originally wanted to spend more time with you,

589
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,000
but now it seems like we must wait until another day.

590
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,500
Huizhen!

591
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
After not seeing each other for so many years, I can't believe

592
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
you've become so interesting.

593
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,600
It's okay. If you're busy, you can leave.

594
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,300
I've already found you, anyway.

595
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,800
Oh, right. How long will you stay here?

596
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,900
I'll stay for a while.

597
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,400
Okay, I got it.

598
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,100
I'll send you there.

599
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:44,550
No need. I drove here myself.

600
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,600
Plus, you only recently came back from America. I know the roads here better.

601
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,800
I'm leaving.

602
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:51,290
Huizhen!

603
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,200
I'll call you again.

604
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,000
The next time we meet, can you leave more time for me?

605
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:04,240
Okay! Bye-bye.
