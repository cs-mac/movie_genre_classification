Damon hill: Everyone
was quite close.

156
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:42,520
Jim Clark
had been to our house,

157
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:46,224
and I knew Colin Chapman
sort of the same way as I knew my dad.

158
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:48,960
They sounded the same,
and they had the same mustache.

159
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:50,762
Sally swart: Colin
was an extreme extrovert,

160
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:52,497
great fun to be with,

161
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:56,067
but very different
in character to Jimmy, really.

162
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:59,938
Jimmy was quieter.
But they were like brothers.

163
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,241
<i>Together, they were</i>
<i>racing on the limit</i>

<i>and ingenuity.</i>

165
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:09,914
<i>They won four world</i>

<i>British grand prix.</i>

167

to hold a motor race
round Monaco.

175
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:07,572
In the first few laps, you stick your head up
to see where it went, 'cause

176

it's just guardrails

the size of the engine

276
00:22:03,056 --> 00:22:05,923
and more than
doubled the power.

277
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:08,392
Sir Jackie Stewart:
They were just racing on the same tracks

278
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:10,361
as they had done
almost pre-war.

279

The racetracks hadn't changed.

The medical facilities

Money meant
making better cars.

305
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:35,379
Max mosley: It was
a formula two race.

306
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:37,815
It was 1968, at hockenheim.

307
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:40,618
In April.
And I was on the grid.

308
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:51,662
( Indistinct p.A.
Announcements in German )

309
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:07,111
( P.A. Announcement
in German )

310
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:26,697
Sally swart: The whole world
stopped when that happened.

311
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:37,875
Damon hill: You don't understand 
when you're young, really, what's going on.

312
00:24:37,877 --> 00:24:41,479
But I remember watching the television 
when Jim Clark died.

313
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:42,947
As you have probably heard,

314
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:45,449
yesterday Jim Clark,
racing driver Jim Clark,

315
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:47,017
was killed in Germany.

316
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:48,519
And I believe
he was a friend of yours.

317
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:49,854
Yes, he was a good
friend of mine, Peter,

318
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:51,722
and I think, you know,
I'm very sad about it,

319
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:54,024
and everyone involved
in motor sport

320
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:55,893
all around the world
will be very sad.

321
00:24:55,895 --> 00:24:57,595
He was a very fine
driver, wasn't he?

322
00:24:57,597 --> 00:24:59,029
I think
one of the greatest,

323
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:01,932
perhaps, uh, perhaps
the greatest yet.

324
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:08,873
Sally swart: It was a deflating tire, 
that's what Colin thought.

325
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:10,875
He was really,
really devastated.

326
00:25:10,877 --> 00:25:14,144
He was never quite
the same after that.

327
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:16,413
Colin Chapman: This is
the tragedy of motor racing,

328
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:18,048
is when you do get close
to a driver

329
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,917
and there is an accident,
of course it--

330
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,420
it hurts you so much more.

331
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:26,257
He was, I would say,
my best friend,

332
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:28,559
best friend I've ever had.

333
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,595
Max mosley:
There was no barrier,

334
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:33,664
and the car
went in full speed,

335
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:35,599
into the trees.

336
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:37,601
I'd always explained
to my wife that

337
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:39,403
as long as you were
reasonably careful,

338
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:41,138
it was all perfectly safe.

339
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:45,075
Sir Jackie Stewart:
We suddenly realized that if Jimmy died...

340
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:48,145
( Sighs ) God,
anybody could be killed.

341
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:54,285
Sir Jackie Stewart:
In 1968, we had a driver die

342
00:25:54,287 --> 00:25:56,620
every month
on the same weekend

343
00:25:56,622 --> 00:25:58,489
for four consecutive months.

344
00:25:58,491 --> 00:26:02,059
And we were racing
on the fifth weekend

345
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:05,195
in circumstances that we should 
never have been allowed to go out in.

346
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:08,399
You couldn't see
sixty meters of visibility

347
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:11,802
because of the fog
and the heavy rain.

348
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:13,237
And the very first
question I asked

349
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:18,909
when I got out of the car
was, "is everybody okay?"

350
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:23,013
Max mosley: If you spoke
to the fia or the organizers

351
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:26,383
and you said, "this is
really very dangerous,"

352
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:29,553
they'd say, "well, if you
think motor racing's dangerous,

353
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:32,856
"then slow down a bit. Don't drive so fast.
It's entirely up to you."

354
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:35,159
Sir Jackie Stewart:
They were blind to the reality.

355
00:26:35,161 --> 00:26:37,194
They didn't
know those drivers.

356
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:38,896
They didn't know
the drivers' wives

357
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:41,765
and the drivers'
fathers and mothers.

358
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,467
Max mosley: I thought
to myself in those days,

359
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:46,971
if ever I get into a position
of any power in this world,

360
00:26:46,973 --> 00:26:49,340
I will do
something about it.

361
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:06,690
<i>One month</i>
<i>after Clark's funeral,</i>

362

<i>Graham hill climbed</i>
<i>back into his lotus</i>

363
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:11,795
<i>and won</i>
<i>the Spanish grand prix.</i>

364
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:23,273
Damon hill: What my dad
did with lotus,

365
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:26,076
he regalvanized the team

366
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:30,414
by not letting this tragedy
be totally destructive to everything.

367
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:39,690
Max mosley: In '68,
Graham hill went on,

368
00:27:39,692 --> 00:27:41,191
and he still won
a world championship.

369
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:45,262
( Spectators cheering )

370
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,568
Max mosley: And you just realized 
this was another world.

371
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,171
The drivers
could just go on.

372
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:56,974
Some just don't
care about risk.

373

Man: Down from the vialone,
185 Miles an hour,

374
00:28:10,423 --> 00:28:12,222
four cars virtually together,

375
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:14,391
and down to the parabolica
they come.

376
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:17,728
Can Stewart hold the line
on this, the last lap?

377
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,963
Somebody's challenging--
it's rindt going through!

378
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:22,599
Jochen rindt takes the lead
in the parabolica,

379
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:24,568
on the last corner
of the last lap.

380
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:28,105
And it's gonna be a fringe
factor to win. It must be!

381
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:30,574
It's... it's over
the line together!

382
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:34,445
And it's almost a dead heat!
It's Jackie Stewart,

383
00:28:34,447 --> 00:28:36,947
rindt, beltoise, and mclaren!

384
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:40,851
Nobody has ever seen the finish
of a motor race like that!

385
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:43,721
I won the race by
about this much,

386
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:45,122
from jochen rindt.

387
00:28:45,124 --> 00:28:48,125
And the crowd went
absolutely bananas.

388
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:50,127
They suddenly
were on top of us,

389
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:52,296
and the police were
trying to keep them back.

390
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:57,601
We ended up by locking
ourselves in a toilet!

391
00:28:57,603 --> 00:29:01,038
And they were still outside banging the doors,
trying to get in.

392
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,475
( Spectators shouting )

393
00:29:04,477 --> 00:29:07,544
There was no more enthusiastic
a crowd of spectators

394
00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:09,613
than that of the Italians.

395
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:12,483
They really follow
the motor racing with a passion.

396
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:20,157
They're so spirited,
they're so enthusiastic.

397
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,760
From that point of view
at monza,

398
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:24,728
it's certainly
the capital of the world.

<i>( Opera singer</i>

<i>Or an englishman.</i>

416
00:30:38,938 --> 00:30:40,404
The Italian fans
stormed over

417
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:42,806
and lifted me up
and carried me down

418
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:45,576
to the podium.
It was incredible.

419
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,379
In my early years,
I struggled

420
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:51,682
to sort of understand
what it means, Ferrari.

421
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:53,584
Yeah, okay,
it's a race car.

422
00:30:53,586 --> 00:30:55,285
Yeah, right,
it looks good,

423
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:57,254
but didn't understand
about the history.

424
00:30:57,256 --> 00:31:00,624
<i>Enzo Ferrari,</i>
<i>il commendatore,</i>

425
00:31:00,626 --> 00:31:03,393
<i>created a dynasty.</i>

426
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:05,829
<i>In the first two decades</i>
<i>of formula one,</i>

427
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:11,068
<i>his powerful engines had</i>
<i>delivered six championships.</i>

428
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:15,072
<i>Ferrari had also</i>
<i>lost six drivers.</i>

429
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:19,276
( Speaking Italian )

430
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:25,349
<i>By 1969, Ferrari,</i>

431
00:31:25,351 --> 00:31:27,351
<i>like every other team</i>
<i>on the grid,</i>

432
00:31:27,353 --> 00:31:32,189
<i>was chasing Chapman and lotus</i>
<i>into a brave new world.</i>

433
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:38,528
Sir Jackie Stewart: Suddenly,
we were running biplanes.

434
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:46,603
Max mosley: When the wings came,
it was a step change.

435
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:49,673
The aerodynamics
gives the tire more grip.

436
00:31:49,675 --> 00:31:52,309
That enables the car to go
faster round the corner.

437
00:31:52,311 --> 00:31:54,111
Obviously, the drag
from the wings

438
00:31:54,113 --> 00:31:56,246
makes the car go slower
on the straight,

439
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:58,649
but peak cornering
speeds went up.

440
00:31:58,651 --> 00:32:01,885
Mario andretti: Obviously, 
as you increase the cornering speed,

441
00:32:01,887 --> 00:32:04,087
things become more dangerous.

442
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,923
This was the evolution
of the sport.

443
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:08,158
You cannot stop progress.

Colin Chapman arrived

447
00:32:17,836 --> 00:32:21,805
at 4:00 in the morning, and he'd
suddenly had this dream--

448
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:23,473
huge wings.

00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:58,075
the wings appear
to start to buckle.

457
00:32:58,077 --> 00:33:00,410
Graham's went first.

458
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:03,747
One of the boys ran back
to try and signal

459
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:05,749
jochen's car.

460
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:12,723
<i>Rindt's wings collapsed</i>
<i>at the same turn in the track.</i>

461
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:22,065
<i>Hill escaped unhurt,</i>

462
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:24,601
<i>then fought to pull</i>
<i>his young teammate</i>

463
00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:26,303
<i>out of the wreckage.</i>

464
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,876
<i>Rindt suffered a broken nose,</i>
<i>a fractured jaw,</i>

465
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:36,480
<i>and shattered confidence</i>
<i>in the man building his cars.</i>

466
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:43,720
<i>If Jim Clark had been like</i>
<i>a brother to Colin Chapman,</i>

467
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:47,157
<i>jochen rindt</i>
<i>was like a petulant son.</i>

468
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,029
Eddie Dennis: Jochen had a few
ups and downs with the old man.

469
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,736
<i>Orphaned when he was</i>
<i>just 15 months old,</i>

470
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:03,106
<i>he assumed his family</i>
<i>inheritance at 18,</i>

471
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:05,642
<i>and started buying</i>
<i>racing cars.</i>

472
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:11,081
<i>At 25, he married</i>
<i>a fashion model, Nina Lincoln,</i>

473
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:13,650
<i>the daughter</i>
<i>of another racer.</i>

474
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:17,454
John Miles:
Jochen was acerbic,

475
00:34:17,456 --> 00:34:21,858
apt to react very
strongly to situations.

476
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:27,297
( Speaking German )

477
00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:29,433
Eddie Dennis: On one
or two occasions,

478
00:34:29,435 --> 00:34:32,636
rindt wouldn't actually drive
one or two cars because he felt

479
00:34:32,638 --> 00:34:35,505
that the design of
the car was unsafe.

480
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:37,707
Max mosley: Drivers,
when they're young,

481
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:39,509
they will drive
whatever you give them.

482
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:42,646
Jochen rindt
was completely different.

483
00:34:42,648 --> 00:34:44,614
Eddie Dennis: I can
remember at one point

484
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:46,716
he put a dollar sign
on his helmet.

485
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:49,453
He was looking for someone to buy him
out of his contract.

486
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:55,592
Max mosley: Jochen, he had
this mysterious manager

487
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:57,594
called ecclestone.

488
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:00,497
John Miles: Rindt and Bernie
were always playing cards,

489
00:35:00,499 --> 00:35:03,433
and he had
a sort of a live-wire,

490
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,435
sort of businessman
feel about him.

491
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:09,506
Herbie blash: Bernie could
handle Colin Chapman.

492
00:35:09,508 --> 00:35:11,308
Normally people
went up to Colin

493
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:13,543
and they were more or less
on their hands and knees.

494
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:15,846
He wanted jochen to drive a car
that jochen didn't want to drive,

495
00:35:15,848 --> 00:35:17,314
thought it wasn't safe.

496
00:35:17,316 --> 00:35:20,183
They had a few arguments
over that.

497
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:22,018
All these cars
were super light

498
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,720
and probably not safe.

499
00:35:23,722 --> 00:35:25,689
It was certainly
gonna be quicker.

500
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:28,358
<i>In 1970,</i>

501
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,360
<i>Chapman unveiled</i>
<i>a new-look lotus</i>

502
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:32,362
<i>for his steely young driver</i>

503
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:35,732
<i>that would bring formula one</i>
<i>into the modern age.</i>

504
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:38,335
John Miles: The wedge shape,
the side radiators--

505
00:35:38,337 --> 00:35:42,639
it was all highly advanced
and amazingly...

506
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,307
Fragile.

507
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:50,046
The car was being
developed at race meetings

508
00:35:50,048 --> 00:35:52,182
in the back of trucks.

509
00:35:52,184 --> 00:35:54,885
A lot of things
fell off, broke.

510
00:35:54,887 --> 00:35:57,621
John barnard: The whole safety
thing wasn't even an issue.

511
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,391
Let's not beat
around the bush--

512
00:36:01,393 --> 00:36:04,194
a designer's
first requirement

513
00:36:04,196 --> 00:36:06,930
is to make it fast.

514
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:08,665
Being quick comes first.

515
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:16,573
<i>One month</i>
<i>into the 1970 season,</i>

516
00:36:16,575 --> 00:36:18,575
<i>rindt set aside</i>
<i>his reservations</i>

517
00:36:18,577 --> 00:36:20,577
<i>and sent Chapman's</i>
<i>new lotus</i>

518
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:23,580
<i>roaring</i>
<i>into the history books.</i>

519
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:41,231
Sir Jackie Stewart: Jochen rindt and I
were the two fastest drivers,

520
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:42,866
that'd be fair to say.

521
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:47,437
I saw a lot of the back side
of his car in 1970.

522
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:58,114
<i>They came to monza</i>

523
00:36:58,116 --> 00:36:59,950
<i>with almost twice</i>
<i>as many points</i>

524
00:36:59,952 --> 00:37:01,451
<i>as the second place team,</i>

525
00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:04,921
<i>owner/driver Jack brabham.</i>

526
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:08,758
At practice, we often decided
to take the wings off the car.

527
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,828
It was all to do
with straight-line speed.

528
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:14,164
At monza, you gained
more down the straight.

529
00:37:14,166 --> 00:37:18,735
Eddie Dennis: Seventy-five percent
of the drivers take the wings off.

530
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:22,138
The wings were off my car,
and the car was absolutely,

531
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,773
for me, undrivable.

532
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:25,976
It's the first time I've been
really, really frightened

533
00:37:25,978 --> 00:37:27,377
in a racing car.

534
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:30,981
Jochen felt the only way
he was gonna go really fast

535
00:37:30,983 --> 00:37:32,649
was to get rid of the wings

536
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:34,751
and sort of
hang the consequences.

537
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:40,724
Eddie Dennis: But the 72 had never been raced
without wings.

538
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:26,569
Sir Jackie Stewart: I ran back
to see Nina, his wife,

539
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:28,238
to tell her
what was happening,

540
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,374
but I didn't know what
the situation was with jochen,

541
00:38:31,376 --> 00:38:34,611
but I certainly
didn't want to worry her.

542
00:38:34,613 --> 00:38:38,348
Bernie and I ran down
to the parabolica

543
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:41,384
to see what we'd find.

544
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:44,688
Jochen had gone by then.

545
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,356
Eddie Dennis:
It comes over you

546
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:49,192
that you're the last person
they talked to.

547
00:38:49,194 --> 00:38:54,364
You search your brain to see if 
there's something that you've done wrong,

548
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:58,368
but jochen, he said, "leave the wings off,"
he said, "for sure."

549
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:08,678
( Speaking German )

550
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,880
That you would
stop racing.

551
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:12,582
( Rindt laughs )

552
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:16,886
<i>One of the first men</i>

553
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:19,589
<i>to openly question</i>
<i>the safety of his sport</i>

554
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:22,659
<i>was silenced at the age of 28.</i>

555
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:25,895
<i>Two months later,</i>

556
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:28,765
<i>his widow was awarded</i>
<i>the world championship--</i>

557
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:32,669
<i>the only posthumous title</i>
<i>ever won in formula one.</i>

558
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:35,605
The lesson of
jochen rindt was that

559
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:38,274
had he had even basic
proper medical attention,

560
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:39,943
he would have survived.

561
00:39:39,945 --> 00:39:42,846
Sir Jackie Stewart: The grand
prix drivers' association

562
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:45,982
had a really good
articulated vehicle

563
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:47,751
with everything on board.

564
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:52,889
The people did not
put him into that vehicle.

565
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:55,091
They took him
to the wrong hospital,

566
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:58,161
and the time he'd got
to the right hospital, he'd died.

567
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:03,466
<i>Jochen rindt was</i>
<i>the third formula one star</i>

568
00:40:03,468 --> 00:40:05,602
<i>to be killed that season.</i>

569
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:13,309
Bruce mclaren was
killed at goodwood.

570
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:14,644
Nineteen days later,

571
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:17,614
piers courage was killed
in the Dutch grand prix.

572
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:22,552
Those were tragic times
in so many ways,

573
00:40:22,554 --> 00:40:26,756
because we lost some
icons of our sport.

574
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,894
He had an accident.

575
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:33,496
As far as the world knew,
that's what happened--

576
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:35,665
he'd had an accident
and got killed.

577
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:37,667
And nobody really
looked behind it,

578
00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:39,335
why the accident happened

579
00:40:39,337 --> 00:40:42,205
and could somebody have done something
to stop it happening.

580
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:47,844
Mario andretti:
It always took some kind of a tragic event

581
00:40:47,846 --> 00:40:50,947
for us to say,
"you know what? We can do better."

582
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:53,516
We're getting smarter
and smarter about these cars.

583
00:40:53,518 --> 00:40:56,486
We're able to
make 'em go faster.

584
00:40:56,488 --> 00:41:00,056
Why can't we use the same knowledge
to make 'em safer?

585
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,998
There is a parallel
between formula one racing

586
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,500
and space.

587
00:41:10,502 --> 00:41:13,570
As a kid, I followed
all the moon missions.

588
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,680
NASA technician:
Five... four... three...

589
00:41:23,682 --> 00:41:26,583
Two... one.
Ignition sequence--

590
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:31,721
NASA technician:
Liftoff! We have a liftoff!

591
00:41:31,723 --> 00:41:33,590
Koen vergeer:
It was the same time

592
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:35,725
they sent men in rockets
to the moon.

593
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:40,897
They are carrying fire
inside these machines.

594
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,668
They are
driving over the edge...

595
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:51,341
Into new worlds,
getting beyond boundaries.

596
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:52,709
Also about life and death.

597
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,814
( Spectators cheering )

598
00:41:57,816 --> 00:42:00,183
Koen vergeer:
And that's formula one, too.

599
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:06,155
You knew when
the season started,

600
00:42:06,157 --> 00:42:08,791
one or two of your
heroes would be killed.

601
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,763
<i>Koen vergeer was among</i>
<i>the legion of boys worldwide</i>

602
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:15,899
<i>who became obsessed</i>
<i>with formula one</i>

603
00:42:15,901 --> 00:42:18,568
<i>during its most</i>
<i>violent decade.</i>

604
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:22,605
<i>He was just 11 years old</i>
<i>when he saw his first race,</i>

605
00:42:22,607 --> 00:42:25,275
<i>the Dutch grand prix</i>
<i>at zandvoort.</i>

606
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:28,778
Koen vergeer:
We went there by train,

607
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,780
and you go into the sand
of the dunes.

608
00:42:30,782 --> 00:42:33,816
And nothing is organized--
no signs at all, nothing.

609
00:42:33,818 --> 00:42:36,586
You can be lost in the dunes,
if you want to.

610
00:42:36,588 --> 00:42:40,256
And after a half an hour,
you find the track.

611
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:47,797
John hogan: In the early
'70s, formula one was

612
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:49,899
really a little bit
of a circus act.

613
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:52,201
Maurice Hamilton:
You'd go to a grand prix.

614
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:53,736
Until the cars cars
came out to practice,

615
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,505
you wouldn't know
who's gonna turn up.

616
00:42:55,507 --> 00:42:58,374
Paddy McNally:
Each team would negotiate

617
00:42:58,376 --> 00:43:03,212
with the individual promoters
at these various circuits.

618
00:43:03,214 --> 00:43:07,216
John hogan:
In fact, the organizers paid the broadcasters

619
00:43:07,218 --> 00:43:08,818
to show the grand prix.

620
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:11,454
The whole business was much more informal
in those days,

621
00:43:11,456 --> 00:43:13,222
so even as a fan,
you could literally

622
00:43:13,224 --> 00:43:17,560
go into the paddock,
and there were your heroes.

623
00:43:17,562 --> 00:43:22,732
Koen vergeer: Jacky ickx was my hero.
He had his mysterious name.

624
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:30,406
<i>Jacky ickx,</i>
<i>the baby-faced Belgian,</i>

<i>with Ferrari in 1970,</i>

626

<i>for the championship.</i>

628
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:41,851
<i>In truth, ickx came</i>
<i>perilously close to becoming</i>

629
00:43:41,853 --> 00:43:43,753
<i>the fourth casualty</i>
<i>of the season.</i>

630
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:53,363
( Spectators screaming )

631
00:43:53,365 --> 00:43:58,368
Jacky ickx: Being burnt is one of the
most painful things you can have.

632
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:00,703
You can be broken, you can
have all sort of things,

633
00:44:00,705 --> 00:44:04,907
but being burned,
it's really-- it's terrible.

634
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,680
Jacky ickx: I never thought
it could happen to me.

635
00:44:10,682 --> 00:44:12,582
It's not
gonna happen to me.

636
00:44:12,584 --> 00:44:13,916
You always think
it's going to happen

637
00:44:13,918 --> 00:44:15,351
to the other driver,
not to you.

638
00:44:15,353 --> 00:44:17,420
John Watson: It was never
going to happen to me.

639
00:44:17,422 --> 00:44:19,889
Sir Jackie Stewart:
A lot of drivers have the philosophy

640
00:44:19,891 --> 00:44:22,392
that it's always someone else
who has an accident,

641
00:44:22,394 --> 00:44:23,793
it's never themselves.

642
00:44:23,795 --> 00:44:26,195
But of course you're
always on the very thin line

643
00:44:26,197 --> 00:44:29,732
between survival
and even disaster,

644
00:44:29,734 --> 00:44:31,434
or certainly death.

645
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:36,205
Jackie Stewart had
a huge accident at spa.

646
00:44:36,207 --> 00:44:39,575
He was trapped
in his car upside down,

647
00:44:39,577 --> 00:44:41,744
and he was soaked in fuel.

648
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:47,383
Max mosley: The great fear
was fire in those days.

649
00:44:47,385 --> 00:44:50,653
Those cars were all
effectively a mobile bomb

650
00:44:50,655 --> 00:44:51,921
because in an accident,

651
00:44:51,923 --> 00:44:54,891
the fuel went everywhere
and caught fire.

652
00:44:54,893 --> 00:44:58,161
Nigel roebuck: When jacky had his accident,
no one was wearing seatbelts.

653
00:44:58,163 --> 00:45:00,096
That's because they preferred
if they hit anything

654
00:45:00,098 --> 00:45:01,864
to be thrown free from the car.

655
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:05,668

The fia in those days was very weak,

of the organizers,

760
00:50:24,422 --> 00:50:28,224
Jackie Stewart made
a blinding start.

761
00:50:28,226 --> 00:50:30,793
It's still petersen,
just holding Stewart out

762
00:50:30,795 --> 00:50:33,662
as they go through copse
for the first time.

763
00:50:33,664 --> 00:50:37,166
Jody scheckter:
What a driver is there for is to take it

764
00:50:37,168 --> 00:50:38,734
to the limit and keep it
at that limit,

765
00:50:38,736 --> 00:50:41,504
and that's in every part
of every corner.

766
00:50:41,506 --> 00:50:44,073
It's keeping it
right on that limit.

767
00:50:44,075 --> 00:50:45,441
Man: And then
François cevert.

768
00:50:45,443 --> 00:50:50,413
Jody scheckter's lost it.

769
00:50:50,415 --> 00:50:52,381
Jody scheckter has been hit,

770
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:55,651
a multiple shot
at the end of the first lap.

771
00:50:55,653 --> 00:50:58,254
Jody scheckter,
with the mclaren.

772
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:14,437
Man: They're
stopping the race.

773
00:51:14,439 --> 00:51:16,639
Here comes Jackie Stewart,
terribly fast,

774
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:19,175
and Ronnie petersen
coming up, terribly fast.

775
00:51:19,177 --> 00:51:21,544
Jody scheckter: It's a lot of
adrenaline's gone into you,

776
00:51:21,546 --> 00:51:23,779
and you're nearly just laughing all the way
to the pits

777
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:27,316
until you tell the guys
what the bloody hell happened, you know?

778
00:51:27,318 --> 00:51:33,089
<i>Eleven cars retired,</i>
<i>but no one was killed.</i>

779
00:51:33,091 --> 00:51:34,356
Very lucky.

780
00:51:34,358 --> 00:51:36,258
Silverstone, which
was one of the biggest,

781
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,828
if not the biggest accident
in formula one,

782
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:41,730
brought it home to me--
to win, you've got to finish.

783
00:51:41,732 --> 00:51:43,899
Man: Two minutes to go...
( Continues indistinctly )

784
00:51:43,901 --> 00:51:50,239
<i>The next race was the Dutch</i>
<i>grand prix at zanvoort.</i>

785
00:51:50,241 --> 00:51:53,209
We were up on a hill
because my father could film

786
00:51:53,211 --> 00:51:54,710
very good from there,

787
00:51:54,712 --> 00:51:57,213
and then you could walk
down to a fence.

788
00:51:57,215 --> 00:52:02,351
Behind the fence
was the armco.

789
00:52:02,353 --> 00:52:04,787
As a kid 11 years old,
I want to be in that

790
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:06,856
vortex of sound and color.

791
00:52:06,858 --> 00:52:11,827
( Engines roaring )

792
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:16,365
Koen vergeer:
The sound goes through your bones

793
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:18,834
into your stomach
somewhere,

794
00:52:18,836 --> 00:52:22,938
and I remember
the first time I saw the cars coming.

795
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:24,406
I thought,
this is my world!

796
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:32,014
<i>Eight laps into the race,</i>

797
00:52:32,016 --> 00:52:36,285
<i>there was a single-car collision</i>
<i> with the newly installed armco barriers.</i>

798
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:39,722
Koen vergeer: I saw a car
flying through the air,

799
00:52:39,724 --> 00:52:41,423
and I looked straight
into the cockpit.

800
00:52:41,425 --> 00:52:42,758
But it was in a flash,

801
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,594
and the car shattered
on the asphalt.

802
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,368
Nineteen seventy-three,
when I had march,

803
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:55,371
it was Roger Williamson.
One of our cars.

804
00:52:55,373 --> 00:53:00,743
He was a close friend.

805
00:53:00,745 --> 00:53:02,711
Jo Ramirez: David purley
stopped his car, got off,

806
00:53:02,713 --> 00:53:05,247
and he was trying
to lift the car.

807
00:53:08,785 --> 00:53:10,319
And there was all--

808
00:53:10,321 --> 00:53:11,987
lots of people
just watching.

809
00:53:11,989 --> 00:53:15,391
Nobody came to give him a hand,
and he was desperate.

810
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:30,472
Sir Jackie Stewart:
We passed it every lap.

811
00:53:30,474 --> 00:53:34,243
Yellow flags were being
flown to slow us down,

812
00:53:34,245 --> 00:53:35,844
but the race
was never stopped.

813
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:45,654
In those days,
they didn't stop races.

814
00:53:45,656 --> 00:53:47,489
Jo Ramirez: Jackie was probably
the greatest ambassador

815
00:53:47,491 --> 00:53:49,458
the sport has ever had,

816
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:52,861
and he was a great
pioneer of safety,

817
00:53:52,863 --> 00:53:54,363
but if he had to drive,

818
00:53:54,365 --> 00:53:56,365
he would jump
in the car and drive.

819
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:04,073
Sir Jackie Stewart:
When the visor goes down,

820
00:54:04,075 --> 00:54:05,774
you escape from the grief--

821
00:54:05,776 --> 00:54:08,744
the dramas, the troubles,
the pain and suffering.

822
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:10,779
And it was only
when you came back--

823
00:54:10,781 --> 00:54:13,148
you know, the visor
went back up--

824
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:16,585
that reality,
you became aware of,

825
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:17,853
again.

826
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:21,290
Man: Williamson's dead.
There's no lap of honor.

827
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:23,359
Quiet presentation.

828
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,998
Jacky ickx:
It's clear that, in racing,

829
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,799
we are
all the same.

830
00:54:30,801 --> 00:54:34,870
In life, we need
just some extra luck.

831
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:39,708
Koen vergeer:
For me, at 11 years old,

832
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:42,144
it was terrifying,

833
00:54:42,146 --> 00:54:45,714
but also fascinating,
what was happening there.

834
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:51,654
I think they thought
we were gladiators,

835
00:54:51,656 --> 00:54:53,355
and if you went
into the coliseum,

836
00:54:53,357 --> 00:54:55,291
you knew there
was lions in there,

837
00:54:55,293 --> 00:54:57,626
and that chances are
you wouldn't get out.

838
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:01,530
Koen vergeer:
I really began to cry,

839
00:55:01,532 --> 00:55:04,166
but at the same time,
I thought,

840
00:55:04,168 --> 00:55:07,436
how can you cry about someone 
you knew nothing about?

841
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:10,839
Max mosley:
He was an ordinary working-class lad

842
00:55:10,841 --> 00:55:13,542
who'd just done it
by his own talent.

843
00:55:13,544 --> 00:55:16,745
Those things have a big,
big effect on you.

844
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,883
<i>The year</i>
<i>Roger Williamson died,</i>

845
00:55:20,885 --> 00:55:24,553
<i>the fia established mandatory</i>
<i>on-track rescue equipment</i>

846
00:55:24,555 --> 00:55:27,022
<i>and fire regulations.</i>

847
00:55:27,024 --> 00:55:30,859
<i>By then, the doghouse club</i>
<i>was raising money each year</i>

848
00:55:30,861 --> 00:55:33,762
<i>for the families</i>
<i>of fallen drivers.</i>

849
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:38,367
Max mosley: Because there were
things that could be done,

850
00:55:38,369 --> 00:55:42,538
maybe it was immoral,
but on the other hand, I couldn't say,

851
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:44,573
because there were people
who wanted to do it.

852
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:48,744
<i>The only requirements</i>

853

<i>to replace the fallen</i>
<i>on the grid</i>

854
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:52,815

Man: Lord Alexander
fermor-hesketh,

856
00:55:58,923 --> 00:56:01,957
the third baron
of hesketh!

857
00:56:01,959 --> 00:56:06,762
<i>Lord hesketh was 22 years old</i>
<i>when he formed hesketh racing.</i>

858
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:11,200
Lord hesketh:
I got into racing entirely accidentally.

859
00:56:11,202 --> 00:56:14,103
I'd just met the prettiest
hooker I'd ever,

860
00:56:14,105 --> 00:56:15,604
ever met in my life,

861
00:56:15,606 --> 00:56:18,607
and I saw this
post card counter,

862
00:56:18,609 --> 00:56:20,609
and it had this
charming Teddy bear.

863
00:56:20,611 --> 00:56:23,612
I drew onto the Teddy bear

864
00:56:23,614 --> 00:56:27,116
a crash helmet
and a union Jack.

865
00:56:27,118 --> 00:56:28,617
I think it has an atmosphere

866
00:56:28,619 --> 00:56:30,252
of the old-type
grand prix teams,

867
00:56:30,254 --> 00:56:32,287
and, uh, I think that's
anything truly British

868
00:56:32,289 --> 00:56:34,490
deserves supporting.

869
00:56:34,492 --> 00:56:37,860
Lord hesketh: We were there to have some fun.
That was about it.

870
00:56:37,862 --> 00:56:39,661
Maurice Hamilton: 
They were slightly upper class, weren't they?

871
00:56:39,663 --> 00:56:41,697
Lord hesketh and so on.

872
00:56:41,699 --> 00:56:44,099
The more serious
journalists thought

873
00:56:44,101 --> 00:56:47,436
that one didn't come in and do
formula one racing like this,

874
00:56:47,438 --> 00:56:50,072
and drinking champagne
and having fun. Not on.

875
00:56:50,074 --> 00:56:52,474
Man: We don't want any pictures,
we don't want any pictures!

876
00:56:52,476 --> 00:56:54,243

He hasn't got
a very good reputation,

but he is very, very fast.

His nickname is

'cause he tends
to crash cars.

John hogan:
It was not dissimilar

884

He had his fun.
He had girls to die for.

John Watson: He was the kind
of thing you'd read

you were a kid growing up

Jane birbeck: James was
so attractive as a person.

896
00:57:54,271 --> 00:57:58,073
He not only attracted girls,
but he also attracted a lot of--

897
00:57:58,075 --> 00:57:59,875
a lot of, uh, men.

I mean,
I don't mean like that,

899
00:58:01,712 --> 00:58:04,713
but he just had that ability
to charm people,

900
00:58:04,715 --> 00:58:07,015
and freedom within himself,

901

1362
01:24:59,829 --> 01:25:02,963
because when you're in the front,
you don't have that spray.

1363
01:25:02,965 --> 01:25:06,800
When you're stuck behind in second, third,
fourth, or wherever,

1364
01:25:06,802 --> 01:25:09,503
you have this massive plume
of spray in your face.

to see anything.

in the Marlboro mclaren.

1367

Mario andretti:
The visibility,

1369
01:25:21,016 --> 01:25:22,850
especially at
the beginning of the race,

1370
01:25:22,852 --> 01:25:25,285
was no more
than 20%, at best.

1371
01:25:25,287 --> 01:25:26,787
Man: Look at that mist!

1372
01:25:26,789 --> 01:25:30,357
How can they see anything
driving in these conditions?

1373
01:25:30,359 --> 01:25:32,226
A hundred and eighty
Miles an hour,

1374
01:25:32,228 --> 01:25:35,496
you're listening, and then you're watching
your side of the road,

1375
01:25:35,498 --> 01:25:37,397
and if the car
in front of you stops,

1376
01:25:37,399 --> 01:25:39,066
you're gonna be
in trouble.

1377
01:25:39,068 --> 01:25:41,168
Man: And there's Jody scheckter,
going down on the inside.

1378
01:25:41,170 --> 01:25:44,171
Perhaps he thinks there's better grip
down there on the inside.

1379
01:25:44,173 --> 01:25:46,206
And there, lauda,
in the pits already,

1380
01:25:46,208 --> 01:25:49,042
having a cockpit conference
with forghieri,

1381
01:25:49,044 --> 01:25:52,312
the leader of
the Ferrari team.

1382
01:25:52,314 --> 01:25:54,348
What's happened to lauda?

1383
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:57,384
Niki decided to stop.

1384

Man: And there is
James hunt for the lead,

1385
01:26:00,189 --> 01:26:03,857
and lauda seemingly
out of the race already.

1386
01:26:03,859 --> 01:26:05,926
He stopped. That was it.

1387
01:26:05,928 --> 01:26:08,462
In the entire 40-odd years
I've been involved,

1388
01:26:08,464 --> 01:26:10,164

I can remember

1389
01:26:10,166 --> 01:26:14,201

because the conditions were so dangerous.

1390
01:26:14,203 --> 01:26:15,369
Just incredible.

1391
01:26:15,371 --> 01:26:16,837

...Out of the race completely,

1393
01:26:19,308 --> 01:26:23,544
and out of
the world championship!

1394
01:26:23,546 --> 01:26:25,712
Jody scheckter:
It takes big balls

1395
01:26:25,714 --> 01:26:28,682
to make
a decision like that.

1396
01:26:28,684 --> 01:26:30,584
Some people may think
it's cowardly.

1397
01:26:30,586 --> 01:26:33,587
Um, I think it's
probably the opposite.

1398
01:26:36,057 --> 01:26:38,425
He went against
all the things that

1399
01:26:38,427 --> 01:26:41,061
being a grand prix driver
at Ferrari are about--

1400
01:26:41,063 --> 01:26:43,430
in other words,
you drive for Ferrari, not yourself,

1401
01:26:43,432 --> 01:26:46,266
and if you've got
to die doing it, so be it.

1402
01:26:46,268 --> 01:26:49,269
Die, but at least
die trying.

1403
01:26:50,905 --> 01:26:53,907
Ferrari were actually
embarrassed for him.

1404
01:26:53,909 --> 01:26:57,110
You know... "No, the car is--
the engine is finished..."

1405
01:26:57,112 --> 01:26:58,612
And all the rest of it.

1406
01:26:58,614 --> 01:27:01,148
Lauda actually got angry
when he heard them doing that,

1407
01:27:01,150 --> 01:27:02,816
and told it straight.

1408
01:27:02,818 --> 01:27:06,954
Koen vergeer: He was the one who resisted
the myth of Ferrari,

1409
01:27:06,956 --> 01:27:08,422
and he said no, no.

1410
01:27:08,424 --> 01:27:11,225
Who said that before
to enzo Ferrari?

1411
01:27:13,461 --> 01:27:17,831
To these days, I think I would 
never forgive Niki lauda.

1412
01:27:17,833 --> 01:27:19,600
That particular moment,

1413
01:27:19,602 --> 01:27:21,768
he thought it was
too dangerous for him,

1414
01:27:21,770 --> 01:27:26,139
and he forget the...
50, 60 people from Ferrari

1415
01:27:26,141 --> 01:27:27,608
helping him to achieve.

1416

The thousands of people
in the whole of Italy--

1417
01:27:33,781 --> 01:27:36,450
he forgot all of
those people in that time,

1418
01:27:36,452 --> 01:27:39,486
and their beloved lauda,
he become selfish

1419
01:27:39,488 --> 01:27:41,855
and he said,
"no, I don't want to drive."

1420

Niki lauda:
I don't regret it.

1421
01:27:48,062 --> 01:27:50,764
But I already saw
what can happen.

1422
01:27:52,967 --> 01:27:55,669
Man: And so we've got
about four laps to go,

1423
01:27:55,671 --> 01:27:57,838
and James hunt
is still second.

1424

Maurice Hamilton: The championship 
wasn't settled there and then

1425
01:28:00,042 --> 01:28:01,341
when he stepped
out of the car

1426
01:28:01,343 --> 01:28:03,710
because James had
to finish third or higher.

Now, where does that leave
hunt as he exits the pits?

Is hunt still
in the top two hunt?

is currently fourth.

And there's hunt,
going past Alan Jones.

1435

That will put him
into third place,

and into the world
champion title!

he said to me was,

"I loved your father."

quit at the end of the season.

the championship with Niki.

They both lived to win,

I was prevented from
getting there by the police,

1513
01:32:55,304 --> 01:32:56,970
for about 20 minutes or so.

1514
01:32:56,972 --> 01:32:58,838
I mean,
it was absolute mayhem.

1515
01:33:03,277 --> 01:33:05,245
<i>The super Swede,</i>
<i>Ronnie Peterson,</i>

1516
01:33:05,247 --> 01:33:08,648
<i>had both of his legs</i>
<i>crushed in the pileup.</i>

1517
01:33:11,986 --> 01:33:16,222
Eventually, Ronnie
went off in the helicopter,

1518
01:33:16,224 --> 01:33:19,626
and we resumed the start.

1519
01:33:22,263 --> 01:33:24,297
<i>Colin Chapman won</i>
<i>his seventh and final</i>

1520
01:33:24,299 --> 01:33:26,967
<i>world championship</i>
<i>with Mario andretti.</i>

1521
01:33:28,002 --> 01:33:31,638
<i>He also lost his fifth driver.</i>

1522
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:35,342
<i>Peterson died the next day,</i>
<i>after suffering an embolism.</i>

1523
01:33:37,578 --> 01:33:40,614
That was just
a sword through my heart.

1524
01:33:40,616 --> 01:33:44,017
He should not have died
from that.

1525
01:33:44,019 --> 01:33:47,387
If Dr. Watkins
was in charge at monza,

1526
01:33:47,389 --> 01:33:50,857
Ronnie Peterson would probably [Be]
sitting next to me.

1527
01:33:52,827 --> 01:33:55,862
Koen vergeer:
Peterson was one of the guys on my first race.

1528
01:33:55,864 --> 01:33:58,164
All the others disappeared.

1529
01:33:58,166 --> 01:34:01,334
They had stopped,
or they had died.

1530
01:34:01,336 --> 01:34:04,337
On that day,
when Ronnie Peterson died,

1531
01:34:04,339 --> 01:34:08,341
my childhood approach
to formula one ended.

1532
01:34:08,343 --> 01:34:11,111
It was a turning point
for the sport, too.

1533
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:18,184
<i>From that race on,</i>
<i>Dr. Watkins began riding</i>

1534
01:34:18,186 --> 01:34:20,186
<i>in a safety</i>
<i>car behind every start,</i>

1535
01:34:20,188 --> 01:34:23,356
<i>for the most dangerous lap</i>
<i>of every race,</i>

1536
01:34:23,358 --> 01:34:27,527
<i>so he could be on hand</i>
<i>in the event of an accident.</i>

1537
01:34:27,529 --> 01:34:32,132
My job was really to look after the drivers,
and that's what I did.

1538
01:34:32,134 --> 01:34:34,901
<i>He standardized medical response</i>
<i>within formula one,</i>

1539
01:34:34,903 --> 01:34:38,905
<i>mandating permanent medical facilities</i>
<i>at each circuit</i>

1540
01:34:38,907 --> 01:34:42,275
<i>and helicopters on hand</i>
<i>for every race and practice.</i>

1541
01:34:42,277 --> 01:34:44,944
Sid Watkins was the man.

1542
01:34:48,916 --> 01:34:53,520
<i>Formula one still lost</i>
<i>four men in four years.</i>

1543
01:34:53,522 --> 01:34:55,588
Man: An outstanding
driver lost his life

1544
01:34:55,590 --> 01:34:57,424
through what was,
in my opinion,

1545
01:34:57,426 --> 01:35:00,760
a pure motor
racing accident.

1546
01:35:00,762 --> 01:35:02,595
<i>But only two drivers</i>
<i>were killed</i>

1547
01:35:02,597 --> 01:35:05,398
<i>over the next 12 years.</i>

1548
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:08,768
<i>Each death was met with</i>
<i>scrutiny by the men in charge,</i>

1549
01:35:08,770 --> 01:35:11,104
<i>and a haunting refrain</i>
<i>by those</i>

1550
01:35:11,106 --> 01:35:13,840
<i>who knew too well</i>
<i>the price of glory.</i>

1551
01:35:15,076 --> 01:35:16,776
It's terribly, terribly sad,

1552
01:35:16,778 --> 01:35:18,812
but it's always happened
and it always will.

1553
01:35:18,814 --> 01:35:21,448
It's just intrinsic
to formula one.

1554
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:26,386
<i>Until one.</i>

1555
01:35:29,256 --> 01:35:31,257
Martin brundle:
I was driving in the race,

1556
01:35:31,259 --> 01:35:33,259
and it was
a really strange time.

1557
01:35:33,261 --> 01:35:36,863
We had just lost roland ratzenberger
a day earlier.

1558
01:35:36,865 --> 01:35:38,832
And everybody starts
looking over their shoulder

1559
01:35:38,834 --> 01:35:41,034
and looking round at
what's gonna happen next.

1560
01:35:49,977 --> 01:35:52,479
And I remember that evening
that we were talking about,

1561
01:35:52,481 --> 01:35:53,813
yep, it was ratzenberger.

1562
01:35:53,815 --> 01:35:56,683
It was, like, his first race.

1563
01:35:56,685 --> 01:36:01,187
Not for one minute
I thought it could ever happen to senna.

1564
01:36:02,823 --> 01:36:04,157
<i>The three-time world champion</i>

1565
01:36:04,159 --> 01:36:06,793
<i>had become the new face</i>
<i>of formula one,</i>

1566
01:36:06,795 --> 01:36:11,998
<i>the one driver who could</i>
<i>finally challenge the great fangio.</i>

1567
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Eddie Jordan:
You had this great vision

1568
01:36:14,002 --> 01:36:16,536
of a megastar
in ayrton senna.

1569
01:36:18,672 --> 01:36:20,173
He was revered.

1570
01:36:20,175 --> 01:36:22,842
He was probably the most popular 
world champion

1571
01:36:22,844 --> 01:36:24,377
because he had everything,

1572
01:36:24,379 --> 01:36:26,112
and he brought great style to formula one.

1573
01:36:26,114 --> 01:36:27,847
He brought it
to another level.

1574
01:36:31,218 --> 01:36:33,853
He was one of
the most gentle people

1575
01:36:33,855 --> 01:36:35,855
that you could imagine.

1576
01:36:35,857 --> 01:36:37,357
He was getting older,

1577
01:36:37,359 --> 01:36:41,394
and he was starting
to campaign heavily for safety.

1578
01:36:41,396 --> 01:36:42,662
You've seen rubens?

1579
01:36:42,664 --> 01:36:44,030
He's all right.
He's all right.

1580
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:47,000
He's shocked,
of course, but he's...

1581
01:36:47,002 --> 01:36:48,368
Dr. sid Watkins:
On Sunday morning,

1582
01:36:48,370 --> 01:36:51,171
just before the race,
I said to ayrton,

1583
01:36:51,173 --> 01:36:53,706
"you know, you're
the fastest guy around.

1584
01:36:53,708 --> 01:36:56,509
Why don't you quit?"

1585
01:36:56,511 --> 01:37:00,446
He said, "I can't quit.
I have to go on."

1586
01:37:16,363 --> 01:37:21,367
Maybe I should have been
much more severe with him.

1587
01:37:21,369 --> 01:37:25,438
But then, you know,
you've got responsibilities to all of those--

1588
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:28,741
all of those boys.

1589
01:37:28,743 --> 01:37:30,743
And they were boys
to me, see,

1590
01:37:30,745 --> 01:37:33,279
since I was so much
older than them.

1591
01:37:36,050 --> 01:37:38,184
Lewis Hamilton:
I was 9 years old,

1592
01:37:38,186 --> 01:37:40,753
and my dad told me
that ayrton's crashed and he's died.

1593
01:37:40,755 --> 01:37:42,889
And I think as a kid
at that age,

1594
01:37:42,891 --> 01:37:45,925
it's always difficult
to understand what that actually means.

1595
01:37:45,927 --> 01:37:47,760
But I went round the back
of the car, I remember,

1596
01:37:47,762 --> 01:37:49,395
and I cried.

1597
01:37:49,397 --> 01:37:51,931
I couldn't let my dad
see me because, you know,

1598
01:37:51,933 --> 01:37:53,700
you don't let
a man see you cry,

1599
01:37:53,702 --> 01:37:57,270
but I remember that day,
and I really was affected by it.

1600
01:37:57,272 --> 01:38:01,140
Still today, I say he's
the greatest driver ever.

1601
01:38:16,123 --> 01:38:18,258
Maurice Hamilton:
The biggest difference

1602
01:38:18,260 --> 01:38:22,128
between the death
of Jim Clark on the 7th of April, 1968,

1603
01:38:22,130 --> 01:38:25,131
and ayrton senna
on the 1st of may, 1994,

1604
01:38:25,133 --> 01:38:28,134
is that the world
needed to know the answer

1605
01:38:28,136 --> 01:38:30,603
as to why
this had happened.

1606
01:38:30,605 --> 01:38:31,804
Why is this man dead?

1607
01:38:31,806 --> 01:38:33,473
Why is motor racing
so dangerous?

1608
01:38:33,475 --> 01:38:37,310
The death of ayrton senna
was relayed by television

1609
01:38:37,312 --> 01:38:40,046
into the living rooms of millions of people
around the world,

1610
01:38:40,048 --> 01:38:42,048
to people who didn't really
know about motor sport,

1611
01:38:42,050 --> 01:38:43,750
but knew of him.

1612
01:38:43,752 --> 01:38:46,920
Somebody had to be blamed.

1613
01:38:49,123 --> 01:38:51,491
<i>The new President of the fia</i>

<i>the day Jim Clark died.</i>

1615
01:38:54,996 --> 01:38:57,630
I think it's distressing
that so much of the press

1616
01:38:57,632 --> 01:39:02,001
doesn't appreciate
the realities of the situation.

1617

<i>before senna's death.</i>

1620
01:39:09,177 --> 01:39:12,011
They were absolutely
concentrated on,

1621
01:39:12,013 --> 01:39:14,013
why did senna
have the crash?

1622
01:39:14,015 --> 01:39:15,982
Totally irrelevant.

1623
01:39:15,984 --> 01:39:20,653
It's a sport done at the limit
of human and-- and mechanical ability.

1624
01:39:20,655 --> 01:39:23,156
When you do that,
you're gonna have a crash.

1625
01:39:25,392 --> 01:39:27,827
The interesting question
isn't why he crashed,

1626
01:39:27,829 --> 01:39:29,762
it's why did he get killed?

1627
01:39:29,764 --> 01:39:31,497
<i>Mosley called on Dr. Watkins</i>

( Spectators cheering )

1634

Martin brundle:
I remember going up in the air.

1635
01:40:41,903 --> 01:40:43,236
My first thought was,

1636
01:40:43,238 --> 01:40:45,071
please don't let me
go in the trees,

1637
01:40:45,073 --> 01:40:48,441
because, you fly,
you die, into the trees.

1638
01:40:52,312 --> 01:40:54,447
Martin brundle:
Then it starts to roll.

1639
01:40:54,449 --> 01:40:57,817
It feels like being
in a tumble dryer, a washing machine.

1640
01:40:57,819 --> 01:40:59,318
When it stopped,

1641
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:02,121
I could feel this liquid
running down into my overalls.

1642
01:41:02,123 --> 01:41:03,623
I could smell fuel,

1643
01:41:03,625 --> 01:41:06,159
and I thought I was going
to catch fire and burn.

1644
01:41:06,161 --> 01:41:08,961
Man: This is what
we feared at this corner,

1645
01:41:08,963 --> 01:41:11,898
and that was
very nasty indeed!

1646
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:14,300
Damon hill: That's the first
big accident since ayrton senna,

01:41:14,302 --> 01:41:17,437
and the whole world
was watching.

1648
01:41:17,439 --> 01:41:19,605
Martin brundle:
It was the first race

1649
01:41:19,607 --> 01:41:22,208
where they'd raised the headrests,
up beside the driver,

1650
01:41:22,210 --> 01:41:27,213
and that played a big role 
in me not being injured at all.

1651
01:41:28,615 --> 01:41:32,618
Not only was he alive,
but he got back in the race.

1653
01:41:42,663 --> 01:41:45,331
And it struck me then
that we'd moved on,

1654
01:41:45,333 --> 01:41:48,301
that the whole aspect
of it had changed.

1655
01:41:49,970 --> 01:41:52,271
What happened was
the attitude changed,

1656
01:41:52,273 --> 01:41:55,675
and senna gave the impetus

1657
01:41:55,677 --> 01:41:58,311
to really go into safety
on a scientific basis.

1658

<i>In an arms race for speed,</i>

Never had that fear.

1661
01:42:12,327 --> 01:42:15,394
Never been worried about death 
or the danger of getting hurt.

1662
01:42:17,064 --> 01:42:20,099
Sebastian vettel:
270 kilometers an hour through the corners.

1663
01:42:20,101 --> 01:42:21,601
Ah, it's unbelievable.

1664
01:42:21,603 --> 01:42:23,169
Sometimes if you
just look outside,

1665
01:42:23,171 --> 01:42:26,606
left and right,
you think, am I crazy?

1666
01:42:26,608 --> 01:42:29,408
It's almost like you
have control of the danger.

1667
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:35,148
Bernie ecclestone:
There's probably as many accidents today

1668
01:42:35,150 --> 01:42:37,617
as there was then...

1669
01:42:39,253 --> 01:42:42,755
But the results of the accidents
are completely different.

( Indistinct remarks
from race announcer )

Male reporter:
Have you seen the accident on TV?

1672
01:42:53,301 --> 01:42:55,034
Well, yeah, I-I have
seen it also live,

1673
01:42:55,036 --> 01:42:58,704
when I was there! But, uh... 
( Onlookers laughing )

1674
01:42:58,706 --> 01:43:01,240
Sir Jackie Stewart:
The modern-day driver will never know,

1675
01:43:01,242 --> 01:43:04,043
and I hope and pray
that they never find out

1676
01:43:04,045 --> 01:43:09,415
what it feels like to have the consistency
of death surrounding you.

Jacky ickx: The idea
was not to race and die;

1679
01:43:27,435 --> 01:43:31,837
the idea was to race
and to last as long as possible.

1680
01:43:33,607 --> 01:43:36,409
After all I have said
about Jackie Stewart,

I really did appreciate
what he started.

talking about it today,
actually.

1687

We're very grateful

we've won and driven.

you had a good chance
you wouldn't get out of it.

01:44:45,912 --> 01:44:48,514
Emerson fittipaldi:
All these drivers,

1698
01:44:48,516 --> 01:44:51,350
they had a glamorous life,
and they were incredible.

1699
01:44:51,352 --> 01:44:58,357
I love my sport, and it was awarding
to be with my friends.

I'm knocking
on wood every day

1701

that I was one of the lucky ones
that really dodged the bullets.

Max mosley: In the end,
we were able to use all these developments

1703
01:45:10,872 --> 01:45:14,240
to literally revolutionize
the crash safety

1704
01:45:14,242 --> 01:45:16,709
of the ordinary
car industry.

1705
01:45:16,711 --> 01:45:18,844
Nigel mansell: That's why
it's such a fantastic sport.

1706
01:45:18,846 --> 01:45:22,615
It pioneers the evolution
of the car, and going faster.

1707
01:45:22,617 --> 01:45:24,884
But safety's
gotta come first.

1708
01:45:24,886 --> 01:45:30,556
Three thousand people get killed
every day on the roads worldwide.

1709
01:45:30,558 --> 01:45:32,224
To make a one per cent
difference,

1710
01:45:32,226 --> 01:45:34,827
even one per cent,
is 30 people a day.

1711
01:45:34,829 --> 01:45:37,697
Really, that alone
justifies everything

1712
01:45:37,699 --> 01:45:39,632
that's come
from formula one.

1713
01:45:39,634 --> 01:45:44,003
But, you see, one's
always haunted by the past.

Max believes everyone
should live to a hundred.
