00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,340
Are there any new members?

163
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,740
Okay.

164
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,620
Hello, my name is Vaughn.

165
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,380
I'm an alcoholic

166
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,020
and I haven't had a drink in 10 months.

167
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,420
Hi. My name's Earl

168
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,820
and I'm an addict.

169
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,620
- Anyone else?
- You are such a fucking hypocrite.

170
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,660
If you were honest
you'd step up there and say,

171
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,340
"Hi, I'm Earl. I killed two people last night.

172
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:44,340
"I really got off on it,
but I need your help to be cured."

173
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,700
I'm different, Marshall.
I won't argue that with you.

174
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,980
But this is the only place that has ever
helped me be normal

175
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:56,100
and I have been straight,
up until last night, for the past two years.

176
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,740
I'm not going to kill again

177
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:04,700
and I am not going to quit coming here
because it upsets you.

178
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,900
We need a clean-up crew for afterwards.

179
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,140
We need some volunteers for the...

180
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,220
Thank you, Earl. I appreciate that.

181
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,780
Based on your requirements,
this is our first attempt...

182
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,580
SUNDA Y ON PA: Mr Brooks, your daughter
is waiting for you in your office

183
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,220
Well, I hope this is what you had in mind.

184
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,980
If not, we would love to work with you
further on the design.

185
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,900
It's always fun to challenge our machines.

186
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,100
Now, if you gentlemen would excuse me,

187
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,180
I need to see how much
this is going to cost me.

188
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,660
Understand. Daughter cost money.

189
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,140
Me, too.

190
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,220
I believe you do understand.

191
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,740
SUNDAY: Matt Johnson wants to schedule
a lunch for Friday. Can I talk to...

192
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,420
- Sunday, did...
- Can you hold just a second?

193
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,980
Did Jane call and say she was coming?

194
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,660
I would have given you that message,
Mr. Brooks.

195
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,100
- She in there?
- Yeah. She...

196
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,580
She has some boxes
and suitcases downstairs.

197
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,020
And she didn't have any money
for the cab.

198
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,420
And you paid for that?

199
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,100
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

200
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,900
- Hold my calls.
- Sure.

201
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,700
I told you.

202
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,300
When it's appropriate.

203
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,980
You let me know.

204
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,700
And could I have some water?

205
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,700
Hello, gorgeous.

206
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,380
What are you doing here?

207
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,060
I'm sorry, Daddy.

208
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,500
Please don't be angry with me.

209
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,060
All right, I can guess what you've done,
but why don't you tell me,

210
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,300
and then I'll decide.

211
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,180
I dropped out of school.

212
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,420
(CHUCKLES)

213
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,140
Oh, Jane.

214
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,740
Okay, have you told your mother?

215
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,900
No, I wanted to talk to you first.

216
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,740
Well, you're going to have to tell her,
Jane, all right?

217
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,220
I'm not going to do that for you.

218
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,220
(EX CLAIMS)

219
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,900
- Why can't you...
- Sit.

220
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,780
And then, together,
the three of us will decide

221
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,420
where to go from here.

222
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:18,380
Okay, but I've thought a lot about this.
College is a waste of time for me.

223
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,420
How does...

224
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,180
How does somebody know that halfway
through their freshman year?

225
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,980
You didn't even go to college, Daddy,
and you're successful.

226
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,140
I want to come work for you.

227
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,860
She's not telling you everything.
She's hiding something.

228
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,540
I know.

229
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,020
I'm not hiring right now, sweetheart.

230
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,780
Okay, but just listen to me for one second.

231
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,780
Jane.

232
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,180
All right.

233
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,100
Look, what would happen to the business,

234
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,180
if, God forbid,
something were to happen to you?

235
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,940
Okay.

236
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,780
Mom would probably have to
sell to strangers.

237
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,980
Now, look,
I'm willing to start at the bottom.

238
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,500
You can treat me like a regular employee.

239
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:05,020
I just want to learn everything there is
to know about running the box business.

240
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,140
Then, when the time comes,

241
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,100
it can stay in the family.

242
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,620
Hmm.

243
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,180
Well, that's sweet, honey, but

244
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,140
you're not talking about business.
You're talking about emotion.

245
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,700
Now, get up.

246
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:23,420
In fact, your mother and I came this close
to selling out last year.

247
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,540
- What?
- That's right.

248
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,220
And had we been offered
a little more money,

249
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,420
and they still may come back to us,
we would sell.

250
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,540
What would you do without the business?

251
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,860
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

252
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,380
Yes?

253
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,900
I'm sorry. The man outside insisted
that I give this to you.

254
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:44,540
He claims that you'll find what's
inside very interesting.

255
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,980
What is he, Sunday? Is he a salesman?

256
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,020
I've never seen him before. I'll just
give it back to him. I'll tell him to call...

257
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,980
No, Sunday. Sunday, here.

258
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,340
Thank you.

259
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,140
Jane,

260
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,660
part of spending four years at college
is to give yourself a chance

261
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,180
to find out

262
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,940
who you are

263
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,700
and what you want to do.

264
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,420
I'll talk to Mom,
but I'm not going back to school.

265
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,060
Mmm-hmm.

266
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,580
And where would you live?

267
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,060
To save money, I would move back home.

268
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,300
But no rules, no curfew.
I want to be treated as an adult.

269
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,380
And would you pay for rent?

270
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,220
Hmm?

271
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,660
Would you pay for food?

272
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:43,300
No, Dad. You're a very wealthy man.
I think you can afford to keep me.

273
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,980
Sunday, would you show the gentleman
who gave you the envelope

274
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:50,020
into the conference room and tell him
that I will meet him there?

275
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,420
SUNDA Y ON INTERCOM:
No problem, Mr Brooks

276
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,460
And...

277
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,380
What happened to the BMW, Jane?

278
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,980
A friend's going to drive it up.
It'll be here next weekend.

279
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,100
And get Jane a cab.

280
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,740
Call your mother.

281
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,740
Are you going to give me a job?

282
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,900
If it were up to me, and I think your
mother will agree with this,

283
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,420
I think you should go back to school.

284
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,020
You see that, Marshall?

285
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,780
That's why I didn't want to
do the dance couple!

Stop your fucking whining, Earl.

287
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,740
You enjoyed doing that couple just as
much as I did.

288
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,540
And look at the bright side.

289
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:36,140
He came to us. He didn't go to the cops.

290
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:39,100
If he tries to shake us down, we kill him,
period!

I'm not here to shake you down.

Well, then, these are the only copies of
these photos, and you have no others.

00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,220
No. I have other copies and other photos.

Yeah. They liked to make love
with the blinds opened.

312

(EXHALES DEEPLY)

321
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,340
I know you're the Thumbprint Killer.

322
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,660
You've done this before.

323
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,540
What I want...

324
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,580
What I want

325
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:26,380
is for you to take me with you
next time you kill someone.

326
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,540
And I'd like that to be soon.

327
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,980
And you were worried
this was going to be unpleasant?

328
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,500
The answer is simple.

329
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:46,660
Just tell Mr. Smith
that you've decided never to kill again

330
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,220
and he'll go away.

331
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,900
You enjoy watching me suffer, don't you?

332
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,460
In a word, yes.

333
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,340
Where do you think
he has the other pictures?

334
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,420
He put them in a safety deposit box,

335
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:05,500
but I'll bet the box is at the bank
where he keeps his checking account,

336
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,460
and the key

337
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,020
is on his key chain.

338
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,860
He really wants to do this.

339
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,100
He's not going to the cops.

340
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,020
We have a deal?

341
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,900
From the angle of these pictures,
you live on the third floor

342
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:36,980
of the apartment building across the alley
from the couple's house.

343
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,780
- Well...
- Yes or no, Mr. Smith?

344
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,980
Yes.

345
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,620
What time do you get home from work?

346
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,180
6:30, 7:00, depending on the traffic.

347
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,340
You can never come here again.

348
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:55,220
You can never call me.
Do you understand that?

349
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,460
Yes.

350
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,180
Okay.

351
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,540
Tomorrow night.

352
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,580
Not tonight. Tomorrow night at 8:00,

353
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:07,620
leave your apartment building
and walk east.

354
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,540
I'll pick you up there.

355
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:19,780
- Lf you're thinking about doing anything...
- We're both aware of the rules, Mr. Smith.

356
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,780
But I feel I must warn you.

357
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,180
If it turns out that you enjoy killing,

358
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,860
it can become very addictive.

359
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,660
It could ruin your life.

360
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,780
I want to do this.

361
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,180
Okay.

362
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,620
Have I covered everything?

363
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,020
I can't think of anything else.

364
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,460
Then I'll see you tomorrow night,
Mr. Smith.

365
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,700
HART: We've talked to our client

366
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:06,540
and we've come up with a figure
that we feel is more than fair.

367
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:11,100
We can have a check for that amount
in your office by 6:00.

368
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:15,060
Oh, well, we told you in the beginning
what we wanted. That hasn't changed.

369
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:18,260
We feel our offer is more than generous.

370
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,740
I paid for everything
while we were together.

371
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:24,260
And now I'm being asked
to give this guy a bonus?

372
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:29,820
For spending time with me? Time that I've
already paid for in the first place?

373
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:33,820
You know as well as I do, counselor,
you're not going to get $1.5 million.

374
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,580
Oh, I don't know that. No.

375
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,220
Well, in fact, this is the front page of
yesterday's paper.

376
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,900
"Hangman escapes."

377
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:48,580
"After torturing his victims, Thorton
Meeks would hang them in public places,

378
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,700
"church steeples, balconies,
freeway overpasses..."

379
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,500
Where is this going?

380
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,540
Well, your client captured Mr. Meeks.

381
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,100
Come on, Tracy,
this is not a lot of money for you.

382
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,300
And we both know how frightened I was

383
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,100
after Meeks said he was going to escape
and come back and kill you.

384
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,780
Let me ask again.

385
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,540
What is your point?

386
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:12,100
Our point is that Meeks
or someone like Meeks

387
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:15,540
may come after my client
in order to hurt your client.

388
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,500
That's very imaginative, counselor,

389
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:21,180
but it's not based in reality at all.

390
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,580
Jesse?

391
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,740
Now, just let us handle this, please?

392
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,900
- Tracy...
- Jesse,

393
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:29,340
you know what would make me feel
really safe right now?

394
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,300
If you got hit by a truck

395
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,740
and died.

396
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,340
Well, that's it.

397
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,540
Mr. Vialo and I are leaving.

398
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,980
You've threatened the safety of my client.

399
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,540
We're going to have to
get a restraining order.

400
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,220
See you in court.

401
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,860
"Get hit by a truck and die."

402
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,460
Fuck it. It felt good.

403
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:59,060
It's not what's here,
it's what's not here that's interesting.

404
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:02,020
I mean, if I didn't know better, I'd say
these people were killed by a ghost.

405
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,340
The autopsy said there was a tiny piece
of plastic in the female victim's brain.

406
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,980
It's a dead end. He bags the gun.

407
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,180
He puts a one-gallon plastic freezer
bag over his hand to his wrist.

408
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:15,540
The little bit of plastic comes out with
the first slug and the shells go in the bag.

409
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,980
I hear you're looking for me.

410
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:20,100
I received a subpoena from your husband
for your work records,

411
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:23,500
where you were, date and times,
for the past two years.

412
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,460
They're just trying to blackmail me
into a settlement,

413
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,900
but my lawyers assure me
that it'll never go to court.

414
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,100
I can't take that chance.

415
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,700
Almost three quarters
of your cases are current,

416
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:36,780
so until you settle your divorce,
I'm going to have to put you on a desk.

417
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,660
That's also blackmail.

418
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,660
Do you have any idea
what this guy has done to me?

419
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,740
While we were married?
While I was paying for everything?

420
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,500
He was just out fucking every woman
he could get his hands on.

421
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,140
He fucked my friends.
He fucked my cousin!

422
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,140
- He made me look like an idiot.
- And?

423
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,780
And what?

424
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,300
Get over it.

425
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:59,140
You can't grow old as a woman without
having at least one lousy man in your life.

426
00:29:59,140 --> 00:29:59,940
You can't grow old as a woman without
having at least one lousy man in your life.

427
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:03,100
Well, I made him an offer and I'm not
going to give him a dime more.

428
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,740
- Did you hear that Meeks escaped?
- Yeah.

429
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:09,340
I've got every unit looking for him.
Do you want me to put a detail on you?

430
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,780
I think I can take care of myself.

431
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:17,060
That's one of your biggest problems,
Tracy. You don't know how to ask for help.

432
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,820
What the fuck? What the fuck?

433
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,700
Don't worry.

434
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:11,060
If I were here to kill you,
you would already be dead.

435
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,540
(GASPING)

436
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:19,060
After you left today, I realized that
our friendship was a little one-sided.

437
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:23,300
So, tomorrow night when we meet,
would you be so kind as to bring

438
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:26,780
all the pictures and the memory card
from your camera?

439
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,620
That way we can like each other
simply for who we are.

440
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,180
If you don't show up,

441
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:36,620
I will presume that
you've gone to the police

442
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,500
and I will kill you.

443
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,940
Even if I go to jail because of you,
Mr. Smith,

444
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,700
someone will find you, wherever you are,

445
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,980
and they will kill you.

446
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,460
Mr. Brooks?

447
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,420
Mr. Brooks?

448
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,580
Mr. Brooks.

449
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,420
Mr. Brooks?

450
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,700
Wow!

451
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,740
It's nice to have you home.

00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,460
Hmm?

459
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,660
Ask your daughter what the real reason is
she dropped out of school.

460
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:01,060
I told you, it's not the real reason.

461
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,020
Honey, you wanted to go to college.

462
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,860
You had good grades. Your father pulled in
favors to get you into that school.

463
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,860
If this isn't the reason, then please,
dear God, tell me the reason.

464
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:12,740
Why does your mother think
that you've dropped out of school?

465
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,300
I'm pregnant.

466
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,820
But that's not the reason I dropped out.

467
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,900
Being pregnant wouldn't keep me
from going to school if I wanted to.

Who's the father?

Some guy? Does he know?

471
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,220
Of course he knows, Dad.
He's married and got two kids

472
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,740
and wants nothing to do with me.

so there's nothing to be upset about.

476
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,780
I mean, I wasn't even going
to tell you guys.

477
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,500
There will be no abortion, Jane.

478
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,820
No, Dad. You're not going
to tell me what to do, okay?

479
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,740
It's my body and I'll do what I want with it.

480
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,700
I'm sorry, you're right. I said it wrong.

481
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:05,180
I wasn't trying to tell you what to do.
What I was...

482
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,220
What I was trying to say is that

483
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,620
a grandchild would be a wonderful gift

484
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,820
for your mother and me.

485
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,220
Would you really
want to have a grandchild?

486
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,220
Even if I'm not married?

487
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,500
Yes.

488
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,380
A child is what's important. We would...

489
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,980
We would love it
and cherish it completely. And we would...

490
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,060
We would help you raise it.

491
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,380
If it means that much to you,
I'll think about it.

492
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,260
I'm going to have to start getting up
a little earlier, aren't I?

493
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,700
Oh, my God.

494
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,060
Well, we were right.

495
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,780
She was hiding something.

496
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:05,260
Pregnant's not all of it.
She's hiding something bigger.

497
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,900
Something much bigger.

- I know so.

499

And so do you.

500
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,180
It's darker tonight
than it was on your night.

501
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,420
But still...

502
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,900
How did you manage to not
bump into the furniture?

503
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,780
Was the light on? Or did you turn it on?

504
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,340
Because I know you,
and you wouldn't risk a shot in the dark.

505
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,340
Where have you been?

506
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:57,940
Where have you been?

507
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,780
Did you miss the thrill of killing?

508
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,620
What if these are stuck closed

509
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,460
because you yanked them closed?

510
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,340
Which would mean...

511
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:24,260
They were open
when you came into the room.

512
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,980
Thank you. I appreciate your time.

513
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,140

- Fine.

516
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,780
You a photographer, Mr. Baffert?

517

- No.
- No?

it's kind of a hobby. I just started.

519
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,700
Well, I don't know if you're aware,
but there was a murder.

520
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:00,140
Yes, in the house across the way.

521
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:05,020
Well, you didn't happen to see anything
unusual or suspicious that night, did you?

522
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:09,980
No. No. I wondered
that when it happened, but no.

523
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,220
I'm sorry.

524
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:16,020
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody
and I don't want to be late.

Sorry.

He looks clean.

530
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,220
Looks like he's alone.

531
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,460
No, I'll tell you, he really wants to do this.

532
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,820
Maybe I should pull over there
and pick him up.

533
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,020
No, just honk.

534
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:01,140
Maybe he'll get killed crossing the street
and save us the mess of doing it.

Separates from Jesse Vialo,
sued for support by Jesse Vialo,

657
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:07,100
seeing a shrink because of Jesse Vialo.

658
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:12,660
She's caught a lot of people.

659

And look here.

660

This isn't the first time
she's been looking for us.

Okay, here we are.

662

Younger, restaurateur...

666
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,900
She married him on the rebound
from the doctor

667
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:36,580
and I'll bet he married her
for her money and connections.

668
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:40,300
Just because her old man's rich
doesn't mean she's rich.

669

Maybe he's one of the kind of guys

670
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:46,020
that would rather give it to the opera
than to his kids.

671
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:51,140
Wouldn't she have to declare any
outside income and holdings?

Hmm.

I like that about her.

680

You are such a fucking snob, Earl.
You like her because she's rich.

681
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,540
No, I like her because
she's found something that's hers.

682
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:35,300
It's not the family business
and she's good at it.

683
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:39,100
I'd like Jane to find something that's hers

scares the shit out of me.

She's a cop who doesn't need the money

687
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:53,380
and she's looking for us.

688

- Hi, Tracy.

Thank you for meeting me here.
I got you a latte.

Thanks. Do you mind if we walk and talk
while I hear about your big idea?

Sure.

- Lf I can.

696

I'd like to use your father.

697
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:19,580
No. My father does nothing for nothing.

698
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:23,140
Tracy, I understand, but your father
has a lot of political muscle.

699
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:26,060
Now, his pull won't make everything
go away, but it'll be a tremendous help.

Absolutely not.

You're right.
We could have done this all on the phone.

ride the desk for a year,

Then the only other option is your father.
Or money.

706

1.5, and that's it.

Okay. I'll call them today.

holding some trophy that you still have?

put it up where you store your suitcases.

00:57:18,377 --> 00:57:21,737
- None of these are the woman in the van.
- Whoa. Trying to suture up here.

793
00:57:21,817 --> 00:57:23,977
- TRACY: Sorry.
- And your ego can handle that?

794
00:57:24,857 --> 00:57:27,097
No, but it doesn't like the other choices.

795
00:57:27,177 --> 00:57:31,417
Because the FBI is riding hard on me
to take over the Thumbprint Killer.

796
00:57:33,017 --> 00:57:35,858
Until Meeks is caught,
Hawkins is with you.

797
00:57:37,538 --> 00:57:40,978
Nothing personal, Hawkins,
but I don't think you'd take a bullet for me.

798
00:57:41,058 --> 00:57:43,978
I wouldn't take the bullet,
I might push you out of the way.

799
00:57:44,058 --> 00:57:46,938
I'll give you two days. Then I want
a progress report on your divorce.

800
00:57:47,018 --> 00:57:48,938
Look, I have all the pieces
for the Thumbprint Killer.

801
00:57:49,058 --> 00:57:51,738
I'm just not looking at it the right way.

802
00:57:51,978 --> 00:57:54,738
I'll keep the FBI out of it for three days.

803

(EX CLAIMS)

804
00:57:56,459 --> 00:57:57,739
That is ugly.

805
00:58:04,499 --> 00:58:07,859
Mr. Smith wants you to notice
that he's pouting.

806
00:58:10,259 --> 00:58:11,739
Yes, I know.

807
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:33,420
I know you're upset, Mr. Smith,
and I am sorry.

808
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:35,420
Yeah. I'm upset.

809
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:43,101
Maybe I was a little abrupt back there,
but let me explain.

810
00:58:43,181 --> 00:58:46,781
Finding someone
you think would be fun to kill is a bit like...

811
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:49,581
Well, it's a bit like falling in love.

812
00:58:49,701 --> 00:58:53,461
You meet a lot of candidates, and
you like some of them and they're nice,

813
00:58:53,541 --> 00:58:55,301
but they're not right.

814
00:58:55,421 --> 00:58:59,741
And that special one comes along,
and your heart,

815
00:58:59,861 --> 00:59:04,302
it beats faster
and you know that's the one.

816
00:59:05,062 --> 00:59:08,822
The man in the pickup
did not make my heart beat faster.

817
00:59:09,702 --> 00:59:12,382
Okay, the man didn't
make your heart beat faster.

818
00:59:12,502 --> 00:59:13,742
Then who?

819
00:59:14,422 --> 00:59:16,462
I don't know, but I think...

820
00:59:18,582 --> 00:59:20,742
I think I have someone in mind.

821
00:59:21,462 --> 00:59:24,863
- Do you want me to do some work on it?
- No, let's just...

822
00:59:25,863 --> 00:59:28,103
Let's just see how it plays out.

823
00:59:29,623 --> 00:59:32,743
That's what I'm talking about.
That's my problem.

824
00:59:32,863 --> 00:59:35,383
That makes me feel
like I'm being jerked around!

825
00:59:35,463 --> 00:59:37,623
It was supposed to be last night
and then it was going to be tonight!

826
00:59:37,703 --> 00:59:40,223
And now it's, "Let's see how it plays out."

827
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:44,183
I feel like you're...
I feel like you're backing out of our deal.

828
00:59:45,384 --> 00:59:46,984
- I don't like how that feels.
- I promise you.

829
00:59:47,104 --> 00:59:49,504
I promise you it will happen.

830
00:59:49,704 --> 00:59:50,864
When?

831
00:59:51,304 --> 00:59:54,704
When is it going to happen, Mr. Brooks?
When?

832
00:59:55,464 --> 00:59:57,984
Tomorrow night. Same time.

833
00:59:59,104 --> 01:00:02,304
When you come out of your building,
I want you to turn right.

834
01:00:02,424 --> 01:00:05,344
Go to the first street
that you can go west on.

835
01:00:05,904 --> 01:00:09,825
- I will pick you up on that street.
- Okay.

836
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:16,425
I want to do this.

837
01:00:16,545 --> 01:00:20,065
But if it continues to drag out,
I could change my mind.

838
01:00:20,745 --> 01:00:21,665
Hmm.

839
01:00:21,905 --> 01:00:24,825
Don't you think I want to do this,
Mr. Smith?

840
01:00:24,905 --> 01:00:27,465
Maybe you don't think
that you have to anymore.

841
01:00:38,186 --> 01:00:42,306
Even if that guy was charming and funny,
I still wouldn't like him.

842
01:01:04,587 --> 01:01:05,907
(DOORBELL RINGING)

843
01:01:16,748 --> 01:01:18,588
- Hi.
- Hi.

844
01:01:21,028 --> 01:01:22,308
What can I do for you?

845
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:25,028
Detective Smolny,
Portland Police Department.

846
01:01:25,108 --> 01:01:28,748
This is Detective Carfagno.
She's from Palo Alto, California.

847
01:01:43,029 --> 01:01:44,029
Emma.

848
01:01:45,909 --> 01:01:46,909
Emma!

849
01:01:52,269 --> 01:01:55,989
Did Jane ever tell you
that there was a murder at her school?

850
01:01:56,109 --> 01:01:58,350
- No.
- Nothing?

851
01:01:59,470 --> 01:02:03,870
Not that a friend died or
someone she knew died? Or some...

852
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:06,070
Somebody in her dorm died?

853
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:09,150
No. Why?

854
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:13,270
Well, there are two detectives downstairs.
One of them is from Palo Alto.

855
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:15,270
They want to ask her some questions
about a murder

856
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:18,110
that occurred there
shortly before she came home.

857
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:19,751
Gosh.

858
01:02:21,591 --> 01:02:23,911
Well, I'm sure if she was close
to somebody who was murdered

859
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:25,351
she would've said something.

860
01:02:25,471 --> 01:02:26,591
Yeah.

861
01:02:28,791 --> 01:02:31,831
I called Roger.
He suggested a criminal attorney.

862
01:02:32,751 --> 01:02:34,871
They'll be here within the hour.

863
01:02:37,231 --> 01:02:39,031
Yeah. I'll get dressed.

864
01:02:41,272 --> 01:02:44,112
- This is too close.
- I know!

865
01:02:53,832 --> 01:02:55,952
CARFAGNO: Jane,
how well did you know Phillip Ramsey?

866
01:02:56,072 --> 01:02:59,832
He and I were in a couple classes together,
but that's about it.

867
01:02:59,912 --> 01:03:02,472
- Did you ever drive him to class?
- No.

868
01:03:03,833 --> 01:03:06,633
You ever been to his apartment?
Do you know where he lives?

869
01:03:06,713 --> 01:03:10,113
- Which complex was he in?
- What happened to your BMW, Jane?

870
01:03:11,033 --> 01:03:14,913
It was actually stolen,
Sunday night or Monday morning.

871
01:03:16,553 --> 01:03:17,673
ROGER: Detective, hold on a second.

872
01:03:17,793 --> 01:03:20,353
My understanding
is that she's not a suspect.

873
01:04:14,836 --> 01:04:16,556
Well, that was interesting.

874
01:04:18,276 --> 01:04:22,636
- You know, I don't feel so well.
- I think you should lie down. Okay?

875
01:04:22,756 --> 01:04:24,476
I think she should lie down.

876
01:04:30,797 --> 01:04:33,957
Dad, I'm sorry I didn't say anything before.

877
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:37,957
It was really horrible,
but, I didn't know the guy that well and...

878
01:04:38,037 --> 01:04:40,557
It happened around the same time
I found out I was pregnant,

879
01:04:40,677 --> 01:04:44,037
- so it just kind of went out of my mind.
- I understand.

880
01:04:49,317 --> 01:04:51,357
I'm going to go up with her.

881
01:05:02,478 --> 01:05:04,438
God help me. What do I do?

882
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:10,638
She did it.

883
01:05:11,758 --> 01:05:13,198
Didn't she?

884
01:05:14,879 --> 01:05:16,119
Yeah.

885
01:05:17,279 --> 01:05:21,719
It'll take the cops a week to 10 days
to put their case together and then...

886
01:05:22,879 --> 01:05:25,559
And then they will come back
and arrest her.

887
01:05:30,039 --> 01:05:31,999
What are you going to do?

888
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:53,800
Oh, God.

889
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:58,201
Oh, God! I've been afraid of this
since before she was born.

890
01:06:00,361 --> 01:06:01,561
She has...

891
01:06:02,641 --> 01:06:04,241
She has what I have.

892
01:06:05,001 --> 01:06:06,441
Yes, she does.

893
01:06:07,481 --> 01:06:10,601
But you were always smart about it.
She was stupid.

894
01:06:12,881 --> 01:06:16,561
She did it because she got off on it.
Okay, I understand.

895
01:06:16,641 --> 01:06:19,481
She did it for fun. Okay, I understand.

896
01:06:20,802 --> 01:06:26,442
But why didn't she think it through?
A hatchet? And she left it there?

897
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:33,122
They were pretty graphic, weren't they?

898
01:06:33,202 --> 01:06:35,242
That was to shock her
into making a mistake.

899
01:06:35,362 --> 01:06:37,082
What does she think I think?

900
01:06:38,602 --> 01:06:39,922
Didn't she remember what she told me,

901
01:06:40,002 --> 01:06:43,603
that the BMW was being driven across
the country by a friend?

902
01:06:43,723 --> 01:06:46,723
Now, right in front of me,
she tells the cops that it was stolen.

903
01:06:46,803 --> 01:06:50,803
You always cleaned up after her,
whatever she did, all her life.

904
01:06:55,603 --> 01:06:58,603
If the BMW
has anything incriminating in it,

905
01:06:58,683 --> 01:07:00,363
I hope it was stolen.

906
01:07:00,603 --> 01:07:03,083
Or she dropped it
at the bottom of a very deep lake.

907
01:07:03,163 --> 01:07:04,964
Think she knows
how much trouble she's in?

908
01:07:05,044 --> 01:07:06,364
I think...

909
01:07:07,084 --> 01:07:09,004
I think she thought
she'd gotten away with it,

910
01:07:09,124 --> 01:07:11,084
until the cops showed up.

911
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:15,604
I should have listened to her.

912
01:07:16,604 --> 01:07:19,924
She was trying to tell me. It was there.

913
01:07:21,284 --> 01:07:24,204
"I didn't quit school
because I was pregnant."

914
01:07:25,444 --> 01:07:26,885
I should've dug deeper.

915
01:07:26,965 --> 01:07:28,045
And where would you be but at exactly
the same place that you are now?

916
01:07:28,045 --> 01:07:31,205
And where would you be but at exactly
the same place that you are now?

917
01:07:31,805 --> 01:07:33,805
It's not your fault, Earl.

918
01:07:34,365 --> 01:07:38,085
Part of your problem with her
is that you always think it is.

919
01:07:38,165 --> 01:07:42,845
She has what I have, Marshall.
So, on a very basic level, it is my fault!

920
01:07:44,125 --> 01:07:46,245
What are you going to do?

921
01:08:01,646 --> 01:08:05,246
Maybe the best thing for her
would be to let her go to jail.

922
01:08:10,767 --> 01:08:12,687
What about her child?

923
01:08:12,807 --> 01:08:15,247
Emma and I would help her raise it.

924
01:08:18,487 --> 01:08:21,807
You might be right, Earl. You know?
You just might be.

925
01:08:23,967 --> 01:08:26,127
Because if she's not stopped,
she's going to kill again,

926
01:08:26,207 --> 01:08:30,647
and if she really wants
to take over the box business,

927
01:08:30,767 --> 01:08:32,888
the next victim could be

928
01:08:36,008 --> 01:08:37,128
you.

929
01:08:44,048 --> 01:08:46,328
I don't think she'd go that far.

930
01:08:50,008 --> 01:08:51,928
(PHONE RINGING)

931
01:09:00,009 --> 01:09:00,929
Hey.

932
01:09:01,049 --> 01:09:04,529
We received a counteroffer.
Are you sitting down?

933
01:09:05,049 --> 01:09:08,209
- Yeah, go ahead.
- $5 million

934
01:09:08,889 --> 01:09:12,689
Oh, my God. You got to be kidding me.
He can't get that, can he?

935
01:09:12,889 --> 01:09:15,370
No, no, no, my sense of it is
that by asking for five

936
01:09:15,450 --> 01:09:18,170
they're hoping you settle
anywhere between 2.5 and 3.

937
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:19,930
Shit. Can you stall them?

938
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:22,130
Well,
they know you want this done quickly,

939
01:09:22,210 --> 01:09:24,250
so they're going to expect
a quick counteroffer.

940
01:09:24,530 --> 01:09:27,290
Look, I need two days. Just wait two days.

941
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:31,930
Tell them that it's a big number
and that I have to think about it.

942
01:09:32,050 --> 01:09:35,810
- Okay
- Oh, and that picture that he wanted?

943
01:09:40,011 --> 01:09:42,051
Tell him I couldn't find it.

944
01:09:46,411 --> 01:09:47,971
Yes, Mr. Brooks?

945
01:09:50,051 --> 01:09:51,411
Mr. Brooks?

946
01:09:53,011 --> 01:09:54,331
Mr. Brooks?

947
01:09:55,371 --> 01:09:58,771
Before you open your mouth

948
01:09:58,851 --> 01:10:03,092
be very sure this is the right thing to do.

949
01:10:03,612 --> 01:10:06,052
I will never be sure.

950
01:10:08,812 --> 01:10:11,252
You get pissed at me

951
01:10:11,372 --> 01:10:15,132
because I'm always the one
arguing to go ahead and do murder.

952
01:10:15,212 --> 01:10:18,652
Not this time, Earl. This is your decision.

953
01:10:19,292 --> 01:10:22,973
I know it's wrong.
I know in my heart it's wrong.

954
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:26,453
Then don't do it.

955
01:10:28,333 --> 01:10:31,333
Go with Mr. Smith tonight and finish that

956
01:10:31,453 --> 01:10:35,453
and let the police put Jane in jail.
Hopefully that will save her

957
01:10:35,533 --> 01:10:39,893
and we can happily go on
with our tortured lives.

958
01:10:40,853 --> 01:10:43,534
That's exactly what I want to do.

959
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:47,614
That's exactly what I should do.
The thing is, she is my daughter.

960
01:10:48,574 --> 01:10:50,134
And I love her.

- I'll take care of it.

964

If you need me, need me, Sunday,
I'll be at my studio.

965
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:11,815
Call me there.

966
01:11:12,615 --> 01:11:16,935
I probably won't pick up,
so just leave a message.

967
01:11:18,655 --> 01:11:20,655
I'll try not to bother you.

968
01:11:48,336 --> 01:11:50,377
The thing that bothers me about this,

969
01:11:50,497 --> 01:11:54,657
besides the fact
that we are not prepared and

970
01:11:55,817 --> 01:11:59,817
a multitude of other things
is what does Mr. Smith do

971
01:11:59,937 --> 01:12:04,377
when he's walking west tonight
and you don't show up?

972
01:12:04,457 --> 01:12:06,857
That little freak could flip out.

What are we doing? What are we doing?

You sound like a whiny-ass kid.
We're playing a hunch.

977
01:12:22,778 --> 01:12:25,058
We've been following this guy all day.

978
01:12:25,138 --> 01:12:26,858
He's boring, okay?

979
01:12:26,978 --> 01:12:28,578
And everything we run on him
comes up clean.

980
01:12:28,698 --> 01:12:31,578
Well, if it didn't,
it wouldn't be called a hunch.

981

Meeks, he's the guy
we should be looking for. Meeks.

Look where? Please, tell me.

Look, everyone knows who Meeks is
and is looking for him.

984
01:12:43,539 --> 01:12:46,659
The chiropractor was the last link
to his old life that I know.

985
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:48,939
If we're going to find him now,
then somebody's going to turn him in,

986
01:12:49,059 --> 01:12:52,419
or we're going to trip over him
at a bus stop.

On the other hand, nobody knows who
the Thumbprint Killer is or where he is.

988

However, I have a fucking hunch
that this guy, Baffert, does.

989
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:02,780
I've got two days to play that hunch.

990
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:04,460
So, if you think
you're wasting your time with me,

then I'd be happy to do it alone.

to accept the things that I cannot change,

and wisdom to know the difference.

Can you step out of the car, please?
I want to talk to you.

So, Mr. Baffert,
what is it that you have to tell me?

1004
01:15:00,105 --> 01:15:02,225
What do you mean?
I don't have anything to tell you.

1005
01:15:02,345 --> 01:15:06,266
Really? Because I was driving around
and I suddenly got this feeling

1006
01:15:06,346 --> 01:15:09,106
that you had something to tell me
about the murders.

1007
01:15:09,626 --> 01:15:12,306
No. Nothing.

1008
01:15:12,426 --> 01:15:14,426
Well, that's disappointing,

1009
01:15:14,746 --> 01:15:18,986
because when I left,
after we talked last time,

1010
01:15:19,106 --> 01:15:21,986
I felt I had missed a clue
that was right in front of me

1011
01:15:22,106 --> 01:15:24,426
that could solve this whole case.

1012
01:15:25,026 --> 01:15:27,586
I don't know why you would feel that.

1013
01:15:28,267 --> 01:15:30,987
Didn't you tell me
that you were an amateur potter,

1014
01:15:31,067 --> 01:15:33,267
that you liked to make bowls and vases?

1015
01:15:33,387 --> 01:15:39,707
No, I told you that my hobby
was photography and not pottery.

1016
01:15:41,587 --> 01:15:43,547
Well, maybe that was it.

The flight attendant upstairs
said the victims

1018
01:15:47,067 --> 01:15:50,908
liked to keep their bedroom curtains open
when they had sex.

1019
01:15:50,988 --> 01:15:54,908
Could I see some of those photos
you took of that couple?

1020

You're harassing me, Detective Atwood.

You knew very well that I'm not a potter,
and I don't have any pictures.

1022
01:16:25,709 --> 01:16:27,309
So my feeling is your feeling is wrong,

1023
01:16:27,429 --> 01:16:30,229
and you should just move your car

I guess.

Then be smart, Mr. Baffert.

right there at the end.

Oh.

kill somebody else first?

He'll need to see that
to get up the courage to kill me.

Not even you believe that, Earl.

It just makes it more exciting, doesn't it?

1128

To think that he's going to kill you
after you kill somebody else.

You're getting your rocks off, big time.

I just got your message

1134
01:28:02,221 --> 01:28:04,821
The weird thing is
that they closed their curtains.

1135
01:28:04,941 --> 01:28:06,821
At first they were open,
like they always were,

1136
01:28:06,941 --> 01:28:09,341
and they were making love,
like they always did.

1137
01:28:09,421 --> 01:28:11,901
Then when I looked again,
the curtains were closed

1138
01:28:11,981 --> 01:28:13,941
and there were
what looked like camera flashes

1139

- That's what it looked like

That's why he poses them.

01:36:13,763 --> 01:36:16,043
There's a cemetery I know about.

1250
01:36:18,484 --> 01:36:23,884
We find an open grave. You shoot me.
I fall into the grave.

1251
01:36:25,004 --> 01:36:27,364
You shovel in just enough earth
to cover me.

1252
01:36:27,484 --> 01:36:32,684
Tomorrow, a casket is lowered onto me
and I've disappeared.

1253
01:36:32,804 --> 01:36:34,804
It's a good plan, don't you think?

1254
01:36:37,644 --> 01:36:40,365
Why? Why should I trust you?

1255
01:36:42,565 --> 01:36:46,045
You don't have to trust me, Mr. Smith.
You're the man holding the gun.

1256
01:36:46,125 --> 01:36:48,885
You saw me put mine in the trunk.
Remember?

1257
01:36:53,525 --> 01:36:54,965
I don't know.

1258
01:36:56,605 --> 01:36:58,805
You really want me to kill you?

1259
01:37:01,766 --> 01:37:02,806
Yes.

1260
01:37:05,686 --> 01:37:07,646
Okay. Okay.

1261
01:37:09,326 --> 01:37:11,566
But one sudden move

1262
01:37:12,686 --> 01:37:17,406
and I drop you, and I make sure
that your family knows what you are.

1263
01:37:21,046 --> 01:37:22,486
I understand.

1264
01:37:33,087 --> 01:37:35,807
You've come down in the world,
Mr. Baffert.

1265
01:37:47,688 --> 01:37:50,448
Take your hand
out of your pocket real slow.

1266
01:37:54,008 --> 01:37:55,808
You don't want to climb over, do you?

1267
01:37:55,928 --> 01:37:58,888
What are you doing
with the key to a cemetery?

1268
01:37:59,008 --> 01:38:00,168
I own it.

1269
01:38:01,888 --> 01:38:03,328
Why do you own a cemetery?

1270
01:38:03,448 --> 01:38:06,448
Well, you always want to invest in things
that people can't do without.

1271
01:38:06,568 --> 01:38:09,489
Water and cemeteries? Pretty safe bets.

1272
01:38:14,569 --> 01:38:18,049
Here, you'll need this to get out.

(SCREAMS)

1274
01:39:46,413 --> 01:39:47,573
Fuck!

1275
01:39:51,373 --> 01:39:52,373
Fuck!

1276
01:39:57,654 --> 01:39:58,974
Hey, Atwood!

1277
01:40:00,414 --> 01:40:02,334
I want to show you something.

(SIREN WAILING)

1279
01:40:25,575 --> 01:40:26,495
Okay.

1280
01:40:28,335 --> 01:40:29,775
There we are.

1281
01:40:35,295 --> 01:40:36,375
Okay.

1282
01:40:36,815 --> 01:40:42,376
Now, if I stand here and you stand there...
Not...

1283
01:40:42,696 --> 01:40:46,976
Not too far away, and you shoot me,
I should...

1284
01:40:48,136 --> 01:40:51,136
I should fall straight back into this hole.

1285
01:40:54,136 --> 01:40:57,416
You don't think I have the guts to do this,
do you?

1286
01:40:57,536 --> 01:41:01,376
No, I'm hoping you do, Mr. Smith.
I'm hoping you do.

1287
01:41:03,417 --> 01:41:05,177
Okay, let's...

1288
01:41:07,297 --> 01:41:09,217
Let's get this over with.

1289
01:41:20,937 --> 01:41:22,657
I'll close my eyes.

(GUN CLICKS)

(CLICKING)

1292
01:41:46,939 --> 01:41:48,779
I'm sorry, Mr. Smith.

1293
01:41:52,179 --> 01:41:54,539
I really did want you to kill me.

1294
01:41:55,619 --> 01:42:00,139
But in case at the last minute
I changed my mind,

1295
01:42:00,259 --> 01:42:05,579
I returned to your apartment
and I bent the firing pin on your gun.

1296
01:42:08,179 --> 01:42:12,780
In fact, I even brought another one
for you to use so you could finish me,

1297
01:42:12,860 --> 01:42:15,580
if I had decided to go through with it.

1298
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:20,860
Unfortunately for you,
my daughter's pregnant.

1299
01:42:20,980 --> 01:42:23,380
And just before you pulled that trigger,

1300
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:27,340
I realized how much
I want to see the end of that story.

1301
01:42:28,340 --> 01:42:29,580
Don't do this to me.

1302
01:42:29,700 --> 01:42:32,821
If you touch even a hair on my head,
the cops are going to find those pictures.

1303
01:42:32,941 --> 01:42:35,661
And they're going to know
that you killed that couple.

1304
01:42:36,021 --> 01:42:39,301
The contents of your safety deposit box,
Mr. Smith,

1305
01:42:42,021 --> 01:42:43,421
have vanished.

(IMITATING SCREAMS)

1307
01:42:47,781 --> 01:42:49,501
It hurts, doesn't it?

1308
01:42:50,261 --> 01:42:52,222
Help me!

1309
01:43:15,783 --> 01:43:20,143
Before I was the Thumbprint Killer,
Mr. Smith,

1310
01:43:20,263 --> 01:43:24,583
I killed a lot of people
in a lot of different ways.

1311
01:43:51,504 --> 01:43:52,624
Thank you.

1312
01:44:06,465 --> 01:44:09,465
It says there
that the Thumbprint Killer is a monster.

1313
01:44:11,105 --> 01:44:14,585
Annoys you a little bit
you can't take credit, doesn't it?

1314
01:44:14,705 --> 01:44:19,465
No. Anyone who's good
at what they do wants credit,

1315
01:44:19,585 --> 01:44:26,026
but since I'm not going to do it anymore,
I will let Mr. Smith have the credit.

1316
01:44:27,746 --> 01:44:30,466
Don't kid yourself, Earl.
You're going to kill again.

1317
01:44:30,586 --> 01:44:32,306
No, I'm not.

1318
01:44:32,986 --> 01:44:36,826
I'm going back to the AA meetings,
and I will control it.

1319
01:44:46,347 --> 01:44:48,747
But there is an answer
I would like to have.

1320
01:44:48,907 --> 01:44:50,467
(PHONE RINGING)

1321
01:44:53,587 --> 01:44:56,307
- Atwood.
- EARL: Why are you a cop?

1322
01:44:56,507 --> 01:44:57,587
Who is this?

1323
01:44:58,307 --> 01:45:00,827
You're rich. You have a good education.

1324
01:45:00,947 --> 01:45:02,547
You could have gone
into your father's business.

1325
01:45:02,627 --> 01:45:06,508
Instead you went outside all of that
and became successful on your own. Why?

1326
01:45:07,028 --> 01:45:08,348
If you want something from me,

1327
01:45:08,468 --> 01:45:10,988
then you're going to have to tell me
who you are or I'm going to hang up.

1328
01:45:11,668 --> 01:45:13,908
Did you think your husband's killing
was random?

1329
01:45:14,908 --> 01:45:17,468
And I certainly didn't have to
give you Meeks

1330
01:45:17,788 --> 01:45:19,228
Mr. Baffert?

1331
01:45:20,028 --> 01:45:23,468
- What's the answer?
- You don't sound like you.

1332
01:45:25,068 --> 01:45:26,789
Well, I have a little cold.

1333
01:45:27,269 --> 01:45:30,549
- Are you going to give me the answer?
- Where are you?

1334
01:45:31,189 --> 01:45:35,029
I'll tell you, if you can give me
the true answer to my question.

1335
01:45:46,429 --> 01:45:51,390
My father was very disappointed that
I was born a girl and he let me know it.

1336
01:45:53,230 --> 01:45:55,990
I've spent my whole life
trying to prove him wrong.

1337
01:45:58,110 --> 01:45:59,270
Thank you.

1338
01:45:59,870 --> 01:46:02,910
Wait!
You promised to tell me where you are.

1339
01:46:03,350 --> 01:46:04,270
Me?

1340
01:46:06,310 --> 01:46:08,270
I'm on top of a building.

1341
01:46:14,231 --> 01:46:15,871
That wasn't Baffert.

1342
01:48:03,476 --> 01:48:04,796
Oh, Jane.

1343
01:48:06,116 --> 01:48:07,036
Jane.

EARL: Jane!

Jane!

1346
01:48:45,878 --> 01:48:47,118
Earl, honey, wake up.

1347
01:48:47,238 --> 01:48:48,278
Wake up.

1348
01:48:50,358 --> 01:48:51,278
You were dreaming.

1349
01:48:52,998 --> 01:48:57,278
Oh, Emma. I was... I woke you up.

1350
01:48:57,838 --> 01:49:00,638
It's okay. It's okay.

1351
01:49:02,518 --> 01:49:05,519
- Oh, God.
- I'm here. Go back to sleep.

1352
01:49:11,039 --> 01:49:14,039
MARSHALL: Why do you fight it so hard,
Earl?

1353
01:49:14,119 --> 01:49:18,399
God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,

1354
01:49:18,479 --> 01:49:22,479
courage to change the things I can,
and wisdom to know the difference.

1355
01:49:23,199 --> 01:49:25,479
Living one day at a time
and enjoying one moment at a time,

1356
01:49:25,599 --> 01:49:27,680
accepting hardships
as the pathway to peace.

1357
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:31,840
Taking, as He did, this sinful world
as it is and not as I would have it,

1358
01:49:31,960 --> 01:49:35,080
trusting that He will make all things
right if I surrender to His will,

1359
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:37,600
that I may be reasonably happy in this life,

1360
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:41,680
and supremely happy with Him
forever in the next. Amen.

1361
