1
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,840
Uncle Papet, it's me... Ugolin!

2
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,400
It's me.

3
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,160
Oh, it's you, Galinette!
You're back.

4
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,800
- Yes.
- Wait. I'm coming!

5
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,240
No, just throw me the key!

6
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,160
I'll be right down.

7
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,040
What a surprise!

8
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,400
- You're out of the army!
- Yes.

9
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,880
Come, eat something.

10
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,720
I'm not hungry. We drank
all night in Marseilles, so...

11
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,600
Come for supper and we'll talk.

12
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,000
Okay. See you tonight.

13
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,800
No, that's enough.

14
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,800
She's asking if you want more.

15
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,560
Thanks.

16
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,520
When I die, you'll live here.

17
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,800
The Soubeyran farm will be yours.

18
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,520
Meanwhile, you should fix up
your place up there.

19
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,360
Later you'll be able
to rent it to a farmer...

20
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,640
or leave it to your kids.

21
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,000
- For that, I'd need a wife.
- So?

22
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,320
There are plenty of girls
around here...

23
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,720
who'd jump to marry
a Soubeyran.

24
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,480
There's Chabert's daughter.

25
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,920
I bet if you wanted to...

26
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,320
I have no mule...
I'm using yours.

27
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,600
I have no hens or goats...
they're too much trouble.

28
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,640
I don't wear socks...
they itch.

29
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,120
So why would I need a wife?

30
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,920
What about love?

31
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,880
When I'm in Aubagne, I drop in
on those girls. That clears my mind.

32
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,840
For 15 francs a month,
I can choose any girl.

33
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,880
That's all I need.

34
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,080
You don't want to end up
a bachelor like me.

35
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,320
Before I die, I want to see
a child of yours.

36
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,320
Why didn't you ever get married?

37
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,200
Before I think of marriage,
I'd better think of work.

38
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,080
Do you have any plans?

39
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,880
Maybe.

40
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,760
I have an idea for you.

41
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,160
I thought it all out.

42
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,640
I figured out everything,
including the costs.

43
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,800
What is your idea?

44
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,880
To restore the Soubeyran orchard...

45
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,600
to the way it was
in my father's prime.

46
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,600
Two hundred fig trees,
two hundred plum trees...

47
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,160
two hundred almond trees...

48
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,120
a thousand trees...

49
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,040
planted in rows, 30 feet apart.

50
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,960
It'll be like a cathedral...

51
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,880
and every farmer will make
the sign of the cross.

52
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,880
Listen, Papet...

53
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,960
we already have too many plums,
peaches, apricots.

54
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,480
We end up feeding them to the pigs.

55
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,360
I have another idea.

56
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,040
You're my only relative, Galinette.

57
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,960
You can tell me
if you need my help.

58
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,560
What is your idea?

59
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,400
It's a secret.

60
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,120
Well!

61
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,000
Is that you, Papet?

62
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,680
You can't keep living like this!

63
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,080
You're holed up like a caveman!

64
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,960
This house is a pigsty!

65
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,320
And it stinks like a dung heap!

66
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,440
What's going on?

67
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,680
Tell me!

68
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,480
Don't get excited.
I'll show you something.

69
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,600
This is your big secret?

70
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,200
That's how you spend your time?

71
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,920
What'll you give me for them?

72
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,800
- Real beauties.
- They're Imperials.

73
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,320
- Good stems.
- How much?

74
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,200
Well, if this was February...

75
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,040
I'd have offered you...

76
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,440
50 cents.

77
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,600
But the season's almost over.

78
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,520
Still, they're worth...

79
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,000
20 cents.

80
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,000
All right?

81
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,920
Yes, all right.

82
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,200
You were right, Galinette.
You'll be growing flowers.

83
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,240
Why was it such a secret?

84
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,760
I wanted to try it out first,
to see if the soil is right.

85
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,320
Once they bloomed,
I knew you'd be impressed.

86
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,360
The flowers didn't impress me.

87
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,280
The florist did.

88
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,800
- What'll it cost?
- 15,000.

89
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,360
- You've got it.
- You're too generous!

90
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,320
Not really. It's not for you.

91
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,600
It's for all Soubeyrans,
buried ones and future ones.

92
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,240
If its nose was where its tail is,
I would die!

93
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,720
Like us!

94
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,640
- Something's bothering me?
- What?

95
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,440
The water.

96
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,880
What water?

97
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,200
A carnation plant
drinks like a fish.

98
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,960
For my 500 plants,
I shredded my hands hauling water.

99
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,160
Install a cistern with a pump.

100
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,520
It'll be empty in four days
if we water 500 plants.

101
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,760
That is a problem.

102
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,600
We should dig a big reservoir...

103
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,520
that would collect
all the rainwater.

104
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,440
It may not rain one year!

105
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,840
No. We must find a field
near a natural water source.

106
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,920
I wonder...

107
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,120
What if we buy Bouffiigue's field
and his spring...

108
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,400
up at Romarins?

109
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,560
Does that spring still have water?

110
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,280
My father said it dried up.

111
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,160
It's more than half blocked up.

112
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,920
When I was young,
it was a lovely stream.

113
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:15,040
Old Camoins grew cartloads
of vegetables there.

114
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,920
I bet we could unblock it
with a pickax.

115
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,400
You think he'd sell his farm?

116
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,320
Not the house.

117
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,680
But maybe the field
and the spring.

118
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,120
He never uses them.
Maybe, if we offer him money...

119
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,840
How are you, Marius?

120
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,080
None of your damn business.

121
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,960
Why are you nasty?
Are you mad at me?

122
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,120
Neither mad nor glad.
I've got no use for you.

123
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,960
Maybe you feel that way, but I don't,
since I'm here to see you.

124
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,640
If you climbed all this way,
you want something.

125
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,440
Right. But I also
want to give you something.

126
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,000
I don't need anything.

127
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,760
Not even talk.
It gets on my nerves.

128
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,520
Just listen to me, Marius.

129
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,360
If you sell me your property...

130
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,720
not the house,
just the field and the hill...

131
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,440
just name your price.

132
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,120
What nerve! You think
I'd sell my property?

133
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,720
Look. Thousand-franc bills.

134
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,120
Go to hell!
Goddamn you Soubeyran pigs!

135
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,600
Don't yell like that,
or you'll choke.

136
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,360
And don't insult the Soubeyrans,
or you'll regret it!

137
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,440
He's only kidding.

138
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,480
Why is that half-wit mixing in?

139
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,760
I'll get down and show you
what I think of the Soubeyrans!

140
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,480
Lousy bastards! Pigs! Thieves!

141
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,320
Come down here!

142
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,920
Lousy bastard! Come down!

143
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,360
He'd better not croak!

144
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,080
Why not?

145
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,000
Someone could die
from falling out of a tree.

146
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,880
So much for my carnations.

147
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,240
Too bad. It was a perfect spot.

148
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,080
If he doesn't wake up,
his heirs will sell the farm.

149
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,000
We could buy it cheap.

150
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,960
- Let's finish him off.
- No. Maybe someone saw us.

151
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,880
You see, Galinette...

152
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,360
never lose faith in Providence.

153
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,440
Why don't you shave him
in his bed?

154
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,240
I don't shave anyone who is horizontal.
Not even a corpse.

155
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,280
But where are those two going?

156
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,920
It's over here. See?

157
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,360
The spring was by the fig tree.
Don't turn around!

158
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,320
Old man Camoins
had dug a ditch...

159
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,480
that led down to the end
of that field there.

160
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,880
That way the water just ran
downhill by itself. Understand?

161
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,960
Look.

162
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,880
See the soggy ground
around my foot?

163
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,440
The water's blocked, but it's there.
It's easy enough to...

164
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,640
To think he threw away
this gold mine.

165
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,160
Wait! Wait!

166
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,160
Once, before he went nuts...

167
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,120
he said, "My gun is my only friend.
I want it buried with me."

168
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,080
A dead man's wishes are sacred.

169
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,120
Did you check if it's loaded?

170
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,400
I never thought of it.
You can't tell with a Hammerless.

171
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,400
I bet it's loaded with buckshot.

172
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,320
He always kept it loaded
on account of the wild boars.

173
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,520
It could be dangerous.

174
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,800
It has a hair trigger.
A sudden wind could set it off.

175
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,040
- Maybe he set the safety?
- Not him.

176
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,360
- So, you're the heir.
- No.

177
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,560
We were only distant cousins.

178
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,000
But you will get something.

179
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,440
No. It all goes
to his sister Florette.

180
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,320
- Is she still alive?
- Why not? She's younger than you.

181
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,080
Her husband died, but she's alive.

182
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,680
Who's this Florette?

183
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,280
Florette de Berengere,
old Camoins' daughter.

184
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,080
The pretty one.

185
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,840
Your uncle knew her well.
Right, Cesar?

186
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,200
- Where is she?
- In Crespin.

187
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,560
She married Lionel,
who was the blacksmith there.

188
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,600
Were you at her wedding?

189
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,760
No, I was far away
in an African military hospital.

190
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,320
I returned a year later.

191
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,200
I'll write to tell her
of her brother's death.

192
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,000
If she's alive,
she'll claim the inheritance.

193
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,080
She's the heiress.

194
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,240
- Not much to inherit.
- I don't agree.

195
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,440
The house is still in good shape.

196
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,600
Plus fifty olive trees
from before the war.

197
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,920
They're sick! They're dying out!

198
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,400
They just need a tickle
with the pickax.

199
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,960
Sure. Then they'll die laughing.

200
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,040
It never rains on that land.

201
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,680
You hear the storms,
you see the storms...

202
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,200
but before the clouds get there,
they split up...

203
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,320
and it pours on the other side.

204
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,440
- The valley side only gets some drops.
- Maybe so.

205
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:52,240
You may not know
Bouffiigue's land has a spring.

206
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,160
<i>- It had a tiny spring.
- No, it was a beauty!</i>

207
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,840
When I was a kid
my dad showed it to me.

208
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,960
It seemed like a river to me.

209
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,160
Either you were tiny,
or it had just rained...

210
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,520
because when I saw it 30 years ago,
it was as thin as my finger.

211
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,640
Could a spring like that disappear?

212
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,120
I know all about springs.

213
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,320
They're like pretty girls.
Neglect them, and they're gone.

214
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,440
Last year I saw a fig tree there.
That proves there's water.

215
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,320
<i>- There was water.
- But there are new shoots!</i>

216
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,000
You know about mixing drinks,
but you know nothing about springs.

217
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,400
I say this one is dry!

218
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,680
I say the olive trees are dead
and the soil is rotten!

219
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,160
And I say I wouldn't take that land
if you gave it to me!

220
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,960
I haven't written for years.

221
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,200
- To whom are you writing?
- To Grafignette.

222
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,280
Who's that?

223
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,960
You don't know her.
She left before you were born.

224
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,120
When the boys tried to kiss her...

225
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,720
she'd scratch their faces...

226
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,080
with her pointed fingernails.

227
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,160
That's how she ended up
an old maid.

228
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,440
Later she left to work
for the priest at Crespin.

229
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,880
She was Florette's best friend.

230
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,360
She'll be able to tell me
about her.

231
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,360
I made an important decision.

232
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,920
- I'll go see Florette in Crespin.
- No, you won't.

233
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,800
If she knows you want her land,
she'll triple the price.

234
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,880
And if she knows it's for us,
she'll refuse.

235
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,240
- Why?
- That's the way she is.

236
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,000
What can we do?

237
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,520
Nothing.

238
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,720
Florette won't come back.

239
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,600
As a young woman, she loved money.

240
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,000
She's probably worse now.

241
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,800
So she'll sell,
but no local farmer will buy.

242
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,600
They own too much land already.

243
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,840
- A stranger might buy it.
- What the hell for?

244
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,720
To grow vegetables or flowers,
like me!

245
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,520
- Without water?
- There's the spring.

246
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,000
- What if there was no spring?
- But there is one!

247
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,720
You'll never learn.

248
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,360
Here's my plan.

249
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,800
It's already half stopped up.

250
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,320
- An accident could shut it completely.
- What accident?

251
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:55,440
Suppose you walk by
with a load of cement.

252
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,560
You trip, you fall and... bang!

253
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,120
Your cement plugs up the opening.

254
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,440
Here it is!

255
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,160
Good God! It's icy!

256
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,160
Hurry up, you idiot!

257
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,840
Here's the hole!
Give me the plug!

258
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,920
No! The little one!

259
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,080
There's a root stuck here.

260
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,960
That's enough.
I'll have to unplug it later.

261
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,960
I heard something.
In the house.

262
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,960
That's not Bouffiigue's ghost.
It's only rats.

263
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,040
"Dear Cesar...

264
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,000
You always amaze me.

265
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,400
After some 30 Christmases,
you write asking me about Florette...

266
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,760
and your letter arrived
the day she died.

267
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,720
I had just been laying her out.

268
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,080
That's why
I didn't answer sooner.

269
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,160
I don't think
she left much money.

270
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,160
Her husband died six years ago...

271
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,040
and she lived on what he left.

272
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,880
In any case, her son will inherit.

273
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:21,360
His name is Jean Cadoret
and he must be about 35.

274
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,800
He's a tax collector,
but I don't know where.

275
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,520
The notary will surely
locate him.

276
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,400
Tax collectors are never
hard to find.

277
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,720
He's married...

278
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,720
but, unfortunately,
by God's will...

279
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,720
he's a hunchback.

280
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,760
What if some villager
tells him about the spring?

281
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,920
That's unlikely.

282
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,320
The villagers here don't mix
into other people's business.

283
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,760
And the way
you wrecked that house...

284
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,800
would make any farmer
sit down and cry.

285
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,200
You're right!

286
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,640
He'll sell it.

287
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,360
He'll sell.

288
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,640
A pen makes less blisters
than a pickax.

289
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,760
A farmer may grow a hump, but
a hunchback rarely becomes a farmer.

290
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,120
Who would have thought...

291
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,320
that Florette would give birth
to a hunchback?

292
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,640
Well, what do you think?

293
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,800
Look at these giant thistles...

294
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,720
those olive trees,
that wild rosemary.

295
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,760
My God, it's beautiful.

296
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,680
What did I tell you?

297
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,360
It's ancient Provence,
Zola's Paradise!

298
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,240
It's even lovelier than Paradise!

299
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,840
Try sliding it down.

300
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,120
Hello, folks!

301
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,520
Would you like some help?

302
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,880
And how! We wondered how
to unload this one piece.

303
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,880
- You're very kind.
- Let's give it a try.

304
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,080
Thank you.
Are you from Aubagne?

305
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,760
I'm from Bastides,
but I live nearby.

306
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,440
You passed my house
on the way up.

307
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,240
So, we're neighbors.

308
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,640
Almost. I'm Ugolin Soubeyran.

309
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,120
Delighted.

310
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,360
- We'll need four men for this!
- How did you lift it?

311
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,840
We loaded the empty crate,
then put the tools in.

312
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,400
And now we'll do it
the other way around.

313
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,400
I have enough tools here
for a nice little workshop.

314
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,600
Your wife sings beautifully.
It sounds even better than in church.

315
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,720
She has charmed many listeners.
She sang operas.

316
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,360
- In public?
- Yes, in concert halls.

317
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,000
That was years ago.
Today my voice is half gone.

318
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,880
It must have been fantastic!

319
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,080
Glorious!
She triumphed as Manon.

320
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,160
That's why we call
our daughter Manon.

321
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,320
It's a great spot.

322
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,800
A tough climb, but it's worth it.

323
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,280
It's heaven on earth.

324
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,800
Is that why you rented
this old farm?

325
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,600
- I didn't rent it.
- Did you buy it?

326
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,000
I didn't buy it either,
but it's my home.

327
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,400
Are you Jean de Florette?

328
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,680
My name is Jean,
and my mother was Florette.

329
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,680
But my name is Jean Cadoret.

330
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,400
If you'd been born here,
we'd call you Jean de Florette.

331
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:05,320
What a lovely title for a song,
or even a light opera!

332
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,040
You knew my mother?

333
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,920
No, but I knew her brother Bouffiigue.
We were good friends.

334
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:19,400
I'll drink to Mother Nature,
to these fragrant hills...

335
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:24,120
to the cicadas, the breeze,
to the age-old rocks.

336
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,440
I drink to the blue sky.

337
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,480
To your health.

338
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,320
Damn! They always do that to me!

339
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,440
I'll be back tomorrow.

340
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,800
Damn beasts!

341
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,880
I guess you folks are here
for a little holiday.

342
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,360
A holiday that will last
until I die.

343
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,480
I'll live in the shade of these pines,
in peace and bliss...

344
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,400
for as long as God
grants me life.

345
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,560
That sounds nice,
but how will you get water?

346
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,880
We have a cistern here.

347
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,200
It's small. Without rain,
you'll be out of water.

348
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,160
I also inherited a spring.

349
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,080
A spring? Where?

350
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,760
It's marked
on a surveyor's map.

351
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,200
I'll show you.
Maybe you can help me.

352
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,400
This little circle is a well,
or a spring.

353
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,800
Where's the rosemary patch?

354
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,680
Here.

355
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,720
The spring is about a mile away,
at the end of that valley.

356
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,440
That's ours too.

357
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,560
I know the place!
It's beyond that hill.

358
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,720
It's a steep climb
up to the spring.

359
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,800
The water's good, but the stream
is as wide as my thumb.

360
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,720
I hope it's not far.

361
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,040
At least an hour's walk.

362
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,760
We'd only need to go
once a week.

363
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,720
It'll be our Sunday walk!

364
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:05,560
A Piedmontese lumberjack
and his wife live in the grotto.

365
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,000
The wife is sort of a witch.
She knows everything.

366
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:13,400
They're nice, they're clean.
But if it bothers you, they'll leave.

367
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,160
God forbid! If they're happy there,
I won't chase them away.

368
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,120
We'll go there soon.
This water problem is serious.

369
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,600
There's no rush.

370
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:29,320
Right now my well is full so you
can come by for a bucket or two a day.

371
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,520
A generous offer
that I gratefully accept!

372
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,720
You're wondering why
I decided to settle here.

373
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,000
Yes, I'm wondering.

374
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,320
It's because I've decided...

375
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,800
that my happiness lies
in returning to nature.

376
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,600
I'm here to cultivate
the authentic!

377
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,560
The "othentic"?

378
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:58,640
Yes. I want to eat vegetables
from my garden...

379
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,840
collect oil from my olive trees
and eggs from my hens...

380
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,760
and drink wine
from my vineyard.

381
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,880
That'll take time.
The olive trees have grown wild.

382
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,360
They'll need three years
of cultivating.

383
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,360
A vineyard, too,
will need three years.

384
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,920
But vegetables can't grow
without water.

385
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,120
We'll see!

386
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,120
Thanks to the inheritance
my thrifty mother left me...

387
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,000
we have enough to live on
for three years.

388
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,240
And in three years...

389
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,240
Meanwhile, we have big plans!

390
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,320
Thanks again.
I must start work at once.

391
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,320
I notice the roof leaks
in quite a few spots.

392
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,520
- Lots of luck!
- We have energy to spare.

393
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,400
What type of man is he?

394
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,560
He's a city hunchback type.

395
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,760
- A city type?
- And how!

396
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,360
Watch out.
He may be a city chump...

397
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,280
but hunchbacks are often
smarter than us.

398
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,520
What will he plant?

399
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,560
"Othentics"! He'll plant
"othentics" everywhere!

400
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,960
What's an "othentic"?

401
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,880
Probably a plant
that grows in books.

402
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,040
"We must be modern," he said.

403
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,440
I bet he mentioned routine.

404
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,280
Right.

405
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,680
What is that?

406
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,480
It's a city word.

407
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,400
It means that what
our fathers taught us...

408
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,600
is a lot of nonsense...

409
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,600
and that we should be modern.

410
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,640
It's pure bullshit.

411
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,560
He spoke of three years.
That's a disaster.

412
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,040
Don't always expect the worst.

413
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:04,520
Still, Anglade or Casimir,
who are distant cousins of his...

414
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,720
might tell him about the spring.

415
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,960
That would be serious.

416
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:14,800
No. His mother warned him
to avoid folks from Bastides.

417
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,800
He'll buy his bread in Ruissatel...

418
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,120
and nobody must know
he's from Crespin.

419
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,000
But we will tell everyone.

420
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,840
We'll say a man from Crespin
bought the farm...

421
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,760
but we won't mention
Florette's name.

422
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,920
Meanwhile, act friendly,
help him out, lend him my mule.

423
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,520
And play up to his wife.

424
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,080
A bunch of almonds,
two thrushes, a basket of figs...

425
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:48,480
so that when he leaves, he'll sell
the farm to you, no one else.

426
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:53,760
I told him he could have a bucket
of my well water every day.

427
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,920
But not for that reason.

428
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,520
Why else?

429
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,360
Plugging up the spring was no crime.
It was for my carnations.

430
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,880
But if they drink the cistern water,
they'll all three die.

431
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,040
It would always be
on my conscience.

432
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,440
You're just like your poor mother.

433
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,040
But you did right.

434
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,200
I'll try to discourage him.

435
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,480
I'll say the soil's rotten...

436
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,480
the grasshoppers will eat his crop,
it never rains...

437
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,760
Stop it!

438
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:29,240
You'll say that "othentics"
are great, that it rains often...

439
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,680
and he should start
his projects right away.

440
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,520
Remember, it's much easier...

441
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:39,160
to push something downhill
than uphill.

442
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,840
So, push him in the direction
where he'll fall.

443
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,640
As you see, I'm taking you up
on your generous offer.

444
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,920
Just help yourself.

445
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,920
I've been admiring the landscape.

446
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,320
I know nothing about landscapes.

447
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,600
It's beautiful.

448
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:28,240
It's big. You can see
what the weather will be.

449
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,680
That's true.

450
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,280
Come on, I'll show you.

451
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,760
Do this, or the bucket floats
and comes up empty.

452
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,200
Like that it'll sink. See?

453
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,000
How is your roof?

454
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,400
I'm short a few tiles.
I forgot to order them.

455
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,160
Unfortunately they'll be new.
That'll spoil the total effect.

456
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,680
- Nobody'll notice on the roof.
- And still...

457
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:09,120
Help yourself.
I have some planting to do.

458
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,560
A thousand thanks!

459
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,240
More furniture?

460
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,040
I don't know if I'll make it!

461
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,200
1,000 pounds of pipes
and wire fence.

462
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,880
- What kind of pipes?
- Cement pipes.

463
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,160
- Big ones?
- And how!

464
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,080
- How much?
- About 100 feet.

465
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,480
- What for?
- Usually it's for water.

466
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,880
There's no water!

467
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,000
Maybe he'll pipe rainwater
down to his cistern.

468
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,320
- He said that?
- He said nothing. There's also a pump.

469
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,640
- What will he pump?
- I don't know, and I don't give a damn!

470
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:25,280
What'll he do with that fence?

471
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,560
Ready, Papa!

472
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,080
See these tiles?

473
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,080
- What are they for?
- For you!

474
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,680
I've had them for years!

475
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,720
I thought,
"These will make him happy."

476
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:06,760
Many thanks. A second favor
that I won't forget.

477
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,680
I thought about
your water problem.

478
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,520
The cistern's good
for some watering...

479
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,080
but it's small
and will dry up fast.

480
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,560
When it rains,
the road is full of water.

481
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:24,520
If you had pipes,
large cements ones...

482
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,160
you'd have a pipeline
to keep your cistern filled.

483
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,320
What a good idea.

484
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,640
I just happen to have some pipes.

485
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,400
What did you intend them for?
And the wire?

486
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,280
That's a big secret.

487
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,920
A new fence?

488
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,880
Yes, but a special kind.

489
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:54,080
- It'll go two feet underground.
- To keep the rabbits out?

490
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:58,120
You're close! To keep the rabbits, yes.
But not out.

491
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,640
I don't get it.

492
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:06,880
First I'll plant some leeks,
tomatoes, potatoes, chervil.

493
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,240
That's an hour's work every day.

494
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,240
- A kitchen garden?
- Precisely.

495
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:18,640
Next I'll plant
some high-yield crop...

496
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,320
vital for large-scale
rabbit breeding.

497
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:25,640
Large-scale?
You mean big rabbits?

498
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,600
What we mean is hundreds of rabbits
a month, if not thousands.

499
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,720
No, Aimee, we'll stay
within reasonable limits.

500
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,960
Bring me my manual.

501
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,520
You've raised rabbits,
haven't you?

502
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,440
I've got six,
and my uncle has 30.

503
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,520
In spite of that...

504
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,600
you probably don't realize
how prolific these rodents are.

505
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,720
Here, read this.

506
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,960
I can read,
but I don't understand numbers.

507
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:02,120
Well, I do. It means that
with one pair of rabbits...

508
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,880
a modern breeder can obtain
within three years...

509
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,120
a monthly yield of 500 rabbits.

510
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,800
But this expert warns
that raising over 5,000 head...

511
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,880
becomes a public health hazard.

512
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,520
With 1,000 males
and 5,000 females...

513
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:20,800
a breeder would be overrun with
30,000 rabbits the first month...

514
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:24,880
and two million
by the tenth month!

515
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,200
A province or even a whole country
could be wiped out by famine!

516
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,320
- Really?
- Tell him about Australia!

517
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,920
That unfortunate continent,
14 times bigger than France...

518
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:40,440
almost perished from
an immigrant's pair of rabbits.

519
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:43,760
Those rodents stripped
entire fields and prairies bare!

520
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:47,840
They had to build
a 12,000-mile electrified fence...

521
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,800
and they had to slaughter
millions of them.

522
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,800
Are you planning
to raise that type here?

523
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,320
Certainly not.

524
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:01,720
I think the Australian climate
caused the breed's destructiveness.

525
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,560
Thank God!
So, you plan on 500 a month?

526
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,560
No!

527
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,160
I'm all for moderation.

528
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,440
I'll be satisfied
with a fourth of that.

529
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:16,240
I'm counting on 150 a month
within two years.

530
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,320
No more than that.

531
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,200
That makes more sense.

532
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:25,160
Just cleaning out the cages
is a big job.

533
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,680
- That's no problem!
- How come?

534
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,400
I want to see my rabbits run
and hop about!

535
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:41,280
I'll raise them the modern way...
outdoors.

536
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,840
What about the foxes?

537
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:47,240
You forget the fence...
six feet high, galvanized iron!

538
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,360
A six-foot fence
won't stop a fox. Never!

539
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,240
But galvanized iron might.

540
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:57,360
That's why I plan to use
underground burrows...

541
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,520
with cement pipe openings.

542
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:05,440
The opening will let a rabbit enter,
but not a fox.

543
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,440
Good idea!

544
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,200
What will your rabbits eat?

545
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:18,120
- Here's my answer.
- You'll feed them matches?

546
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,080
Are those watermelon seeds?

547
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:34,360
- Are they "othentics"?
- Authentic? Of course they are.

548
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:38,480
These are authentic
"cucurbite" seeds from Asia.

549
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:43,760
The plant grows as quickly
as a snake darts out of its hole.

550
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,120
In the tropics,
after the rains...

551
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:52,000
these creeping vines
can grow 30 inches a day!

552
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:55,400
Of course,
we're not in the tropics.

553
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,240
- Thank God.
- And there's no real rainy season.

554
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,040
According to weather statistics...

555
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,720
based on the past 50 years
we should have...

556
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:09,440
six days of rain in April,
five in May, four in June...

557
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:13,320
two in July and three in August.

558
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,360
- That's just an average.
- It sounds about right.

559
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,200
Since rainfall is often sporadic...

560
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,240
we ought not to expect
this plant's maximum growth.

561
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:27,600
I estimate a reasonable growth
of about six inches a month.

562
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,960
Good! You'd have a problem
if they grew any faster.

563
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,280
You'd be picking up your squash
by the edge of the village.

564
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,600
Good point.

565
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:40,440
I figure each plant will yield
about 130 pounds of squash.

566
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:44,040
Not bad, but you only have
four seeds.

567
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,600
They're hard to get.
Today I have four.

568
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:53,320
But in six months, I'll be eager
to stop their proliferation.

569
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:59,080
If your rabbits and squash
get out of control, what then?

570
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,920
We'll be rich! We must succeed,
or we're doomed to return...

571
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,280
to the hell of city life!

572
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,360
- Well?
- Good news and bad.

573
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,760
He wants to raise rabbits outdoors,
inside a fence.

574
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:39,240
Rabbits? With a manual?

575
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:42,600
Yes, a book. It says
you start with two rabbits...

576
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,080
and get 1,000 in six months.

577
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,520
If they keep breeding, forget it!

578
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,440
That's how they ate up Australia.

579
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,720
This isn't Australia.

580
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:58,040
It's easy to make rabbits
multiply on paper.

581
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:04,040
He wants to limit himself
to 150 per month.

582
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,760
150!

583
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,840
Great.

584
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,800
A toast to the losers!

585
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,920
Is that guy renting the farm?

586
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,080
No. He told me he bought it.

587
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,000
- He's a farmer?
- No, he's a hunchback.

588
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,560
Where does he buy bread?

589
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,640
He buys everything in Ruissatel.

590
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,920
He thinks my bread is poison?

591
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:35,520
No. He avoids the village.
He's from Crespin.

592
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:36,800
From Crespin?

593
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,560
That's nothing to brag about!

594
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,600
Nonsense!
Crespin folks aren't bad!

595
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:43,880
Most are.

596
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:47,200
- What did he do?
- He was a tax collector.

597
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,960
Maybe he'll raise our taxes!

598
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,400
Is he staying long?

599
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,800
I don't know. In any case,
he's fixing up his house.

600
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,160
- By himself?
- Yeah, with gloves on.

601
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,240
Some farmer!

602
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:03,720
A hunchback from Crespin,
hiding on the hill... sounds fishy.

603
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,440
Leave him alone
and he won't bother us.

604
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,840
- Maybe he's a spy!
- What'll he spy on, your chickpeas?

605
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:23,240
Then he said, "The Good Lord
sent us a sure loser!"

606
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,160
Within six months he'll be gone.

607
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,280
He claims he must succeed
in three years.

608
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,200
Easier said than done.

609
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,320
But it proves he's got money.

610
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:35,240
Inherited money
burns a hole in your pocket.

611
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:39,520
In six months he'll be broke
and we'll buy him out cheaply.

612
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:43,320
Meanwhile, let's see what he does
with his Chinese squash...

613
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,160
and his giant rabbits!

614
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:52,040
Mmm! Smells like
she roasted some squab!

615
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,840
He'd better not find the spring.

616
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,520
We should help him.

617
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:16,200
- Hello, neighbor!
- Hi, Monsieur Jean! Ma'am!

618
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,840
How's it going?

619
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,720
What is that contraption?

620
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,800
With your pickax...

621
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,160
you'll knock yourself out
for three months...

622
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,160
while my plough will help us
finish the job in three days.

623
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,960
Aimee.

624
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:45,800
The heavens have
answered our prayer!

625
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,280
It's from his field.

626
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,400
The best soil in the region.

627
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,080
It's worth its weight in gold!

628
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:38,360
Such rich soil!
It's killing me!

629
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,880
He's a good man.

630
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,040
I don't like him.

631
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,480
Because he's ugly?

632
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,080
Manon is afraid of him.

633
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:57,040
Manon, I'm surprised that
you don't like that nice man.

634
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,640
He's ugly.
He looks like a toad.

635
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,960
It's your thoughts
that are ugly.

636
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,920
Ugly exteriors often hide
the purest souls.

637
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:11,720
Look!

638
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,960
Come here, Manon.

639
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,160
I'll give you an important job.

640
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,080
You'll water these plants
carefully once a day.

641
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,640
Galinette, he's a real joke.

642
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,480
He planted tomatoes
on the north side.

643
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:32,800
Even if they bear fruit,
it won't ever ripen.

644
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,880
He pushed his chickpeas
down too deep with a stick.

645
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,560
They won't even yield
a salad bowl full.

646
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:42,320
He planted the onions
right under the olive tree!

647
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:48,400
And he didn't plant
the potatoes deep enough.

648
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:51,480
He doesn't sow seeds,
he throws them!

649
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:55,040
They'll grow in tufts,
like hair on a mangy dog!

650
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:05,480
If that loony thinks
he can feed a family on that...

651
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:13,800
When I look at him,
I have to laugh...

652
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:16,040
but it also breaks my heart.

653
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:20,360
I feel like showing him
how to do it right.

654
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,600
Let him do it his way.

655
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,480
It's not the best way,
but it's better for us.

656
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,720
Are you going on a picnic?

657
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,600
We're getting drinking water
at the Plantier spring.

658
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,960
Our cistern is empty
and we mustn't impose on you.

659
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:44,880
Mine's been getting empty too.

660
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,080
I've a feeling
it'll rain tonight.

661
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,200
Why? You have rheumatism?

662
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:50,920
No, thank goodness!

663
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:55,080
But in May we only had
three days of rain instead of six.

664
00:56:55,080 --> 00:57:00,000
It hasn't rained in June,
so we're owed five days of rain!

665
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:04,800
The heavens have 48 hours
to settle their debt.

666
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,360
What's the shortest way?

667
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,360
You'd better go the easiest way.

668
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:15,680
Follow the valley down,
but before you get to the village...

669
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:19,360
turn right and follow
the road to the grotto.

670
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,640
Thank you. See you tonight!

671
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,800
It's beautiful!

672
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,720
We're the new owners.

673
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:15,080
But we don't want you
to move out.

674
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:19,640
We just came to fetch water.

675
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:28,200
Don't worry.
They came for some water.

676
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:30,840
They won't throw us out.

677
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,880
God bless you!

678
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:49,520
If that spring were near us,
we'd have no problem.

679
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,960
Let's put our faith in
the statistics and in Providence.

680
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:42,720
I'm going to Aubagne.
Can I bring you anything?

681
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:47,240
No, thanks!
Are you buying more seeds?

682
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,840
Even better!
I'm going to get my breeders!

683
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,120
Come see them tonight.

684
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:56,480
Sure! I'd love to see
your first rabbits!

685
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,040
I'll bring along snails
for Madame.

686
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,920
See you tonight!

687
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:19,520
I chose young females
who've had no litters.

688
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,440
That's vital for creating
a new breed.

689
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:27,440
And now the male.

690
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,560
Manon, close the door!

691
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:35,480
He's terribly strong.
He might get away.

692
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,840
Not from me, he won't.

693
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,720
Holy mother! What's that?

694
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,880
He's a cross between
a giant rabbit and a ram.

695
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,720
I never saw anything like that!

696
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,680
It's got fur like a dog
and ears like a donkey!

697
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,240
- Was it expensive?
- Very expensive!

698
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,840
That's a strange one!

699
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,800
He's a breeder.
Not young, but virile.

700
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,560
He looks fierce.

701
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:10,200
I bet he could eat a steak!

702
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,560
He sure got taken in!

703
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,560
What breed did he call it?

704
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,440
The Romarins breed.

705
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:41,440
Go, make us some nice
baby rabbits, old man!

706
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,160
You're going to start
the Romarins breed.

707
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:15,240
There isn't much
inheritance money left.

708
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,640
But I'm sure we'll pull through.

709
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:23,040
Our bills are paid,
and the worst is over.

710
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:35,880
I want you to manage
the 1,123 francs that's left.

711
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:39,880
It should last us for a year.

712
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:43,720
In three months I hope
to start selling my rabbits.

713
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:48,960
If necessary,
we could sell my necklace.

714
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:52,960
- I was told it was worth 10,000.
- Sell your necklace? Never.

715
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,800
I'd sooner go barefoot!

716
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,640
There's Ugolin's neighbor.

717
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,760
He thinks he's some big shit!

718
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:43,720
You should have aimed
for his hump.

719
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,320
That's not funny.

720
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,840
Go on! You're too small!

721
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:33,040
Here's a big one!

722
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:39,920
What a beauty! A real Romarin!

723
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,400
How much?

724
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,720
It won't last.

725
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:03,000
It's enough for my vineyard,
but not for his vegetables.

726
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:09,480
What do I think?

727
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,240
I think it's a disaster.

728
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:16,560
Water!

729
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:49,720
"Rain on Ascension Day
washes your crops away."

730
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,160
Stop worrying.

731
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:08,400
Remember, a wet spring...

732
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:10,680
always brings
a scorching summer.

733
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:17,280
In July his green garden
will be yellow like ripe wheat.

734
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:20,720
His corn husks will crackle
like patent leather shoes.

735
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,960
"Showers in June
only bring ruin."

736
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,960
I'm off to sell my vegetables!

737
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:39,360
This is my gratitude
for all your advice.

738
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:42,480
That rain was a godsend.

739
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:45,640
- You've no potatoes yet?
- Not before three weeks.

740
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:48,280
Really? Look at mine!

741
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,480
How do you do it?

742
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:14,720
Amandine!

743
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:26,680
I keep forgetting she's deaf.

744
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:38,960
That's enough!
Where's my dinner?

745
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,360
I'm hungry.

746
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:50,360
What's worse is that now
he gives me advice!

747
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:03,480
It's all beautiful!

748
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:07,400
But I'm worried.
Summer hasn't started yet.

749
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:09,920
It's July 20th.

750
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,920
In two more weeks
we'll get those August storms.

751
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,320
Losing all this
would be a shame.

752
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,200
My cistern is overflowing.

753
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:21,720
It holds 12 cubic meters,
and I need three every other day.

754
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:24,440
I can hold out another week.

755
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:27,320
But it may not rain in a week.

756
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:34,080
One seed yields an ear
with 400 to 450 kernels.

757
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:38,480
In theory the yield
is 400 times the planted seed.

758
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:39,800
See, Aimee.

759
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:43,600
Even with a more reasonable
estimate... say, 300...

760
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:47,800
I planted enough to yield
three tons of corn. That should do.

761
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,680
Thank you, sweetheart.

762
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:52,240
We'll also have 20 tons
of squash.

763
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,800
Even half would be plenty.

764
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,720
The manual suggests
eight tons of feed a year.

765
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,240
We only have 720 francs left.

766
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:16,000
- The money from selling the rabbits?
- That's included.

767
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:18,880
Now, more than ever,
we need God's help.

768
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,800
There's no more water!

769
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,000
I expected this.

770
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:59,680
I thought we had
a few days' water left.

771
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:03,040
If it doesn't rain tonight,
we'll figure out something.

772
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,720
Luckily we have
the Plantier spring.

773
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:13,880
Four trips a day
will kill your donkey.

774
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:18,240
We can stock
850 gallons in a week.

775
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:22,600
- But we need rain within 10 days.
- Ten days, this time of year?

776
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:24,600
Well, you never know.

777
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:27,200
If the heavens let me down...

778
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:29,760
could you rent me your mule?

779
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,880
- Sure!
- Thank you!

780
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,280
Come on! A little bit more!

781
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:08,920
Galinette, if this beautiful
weather keeps up...

782
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,760
his corn will be wiped out...

783
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:13,760
along with the rest.

784
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:17,960
What's wrong?

785
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:36,160
You gave me a scare.

786
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:38,000
It was only a dream.

787
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,280
It's the hunchback!

788
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:05,280
I'm out! I'm not here!

789
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:18,160
Is Mr. Ugolin here?

790
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:21,600
Isn't he home?

791
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:25,000
Ask him if he'll rent me his mule...

792
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:27,760
starting tomorrow.

793
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:29,800
It's urgent!

794
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:33,080
His mule. Tomorrow!
Thank you!

795
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,480
My chickpeas are rotting.

796
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:52,720
My apricots dried up.
They're the size of small peas.

797
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,960
My grapes won't make
two casks of wine.

798
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,160
What a year!

799
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:01,720
The weather does
as it pleases.

800
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:07,280
It's bad for us,
but worse for him.

801
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:09,600
He needs 250 gallons a day.

802
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,440
He can't haul all that...

803
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:14,880
with a donkey and a woman
and a hump.

804
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:18,240
Another week of sunshine
and he's finished.

805
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:22,720
He wants to rent my mule.
It'll be hard to refuse.

806
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:26,280
Idiot! Your mule would save him!

807
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:28,680
It can carry
100 gallons a day!

808
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:33,680
You told me to be friendly...

809
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:38,160
so I drank his white wine
and called him Monsieur Jean...

810
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:40,080
and he's become my friend.

811
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:43,440
Dummy! You want to grow carnations
or make friends?

812
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:46,840
What a dope! You sound
just like your poor mother!

813
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:52,440
If you start to strangle a cat,
finish it off!

814
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:57,520
Believe me, if he makes out
this year, he'll continue...

815
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,440
and next year
he'll start all over again.

816
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:02,760
And he'll be miserable
all his life.

817
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:05,320
With the money
I'll gladly pay him...

818
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,480
he can move back
to the city.

819
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:12,440
By not lending him the mule,
we're doing him a favor.

820
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:17,080
You're back at last!

821
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:20,360
Yes, for the grape harvest!
It's our toughest chore.

822
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:23,080
Is everything all right?

823
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:25,760
No. I'm almost out of water.

824
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:28,680
It's a bad year.
Everyone is hurting.

825
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:32,480
Even the grapes
are shriveled up like raisins.

826
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:35,960
Could I use your mule?

827
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:39,080
My uncle's.

828
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:42,200
Not right now.
It's harvest time.

829
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:43,640
In two, three days?

830
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:45,640
After my uncle's harvest...

831
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:48,600
Casimir and the blacksmith
use the mule.

832
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:51,680
We do that every year.
It takes ten days.

833
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:53,080
But, you know...

834
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:57,200
with this heat wave,
we may get a thunderstorm tonight.

835
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:00,320
Your word in God's ear.

836
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:14,560
Here comes the loony!

837
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:31,640
He'll kill himself.

838
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:35,280
He can go back to tax collecting,
but his donkey can't!

839
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:37,200
I pity the donkey.

840
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,520
Are mules expensive?

841
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:29,480
I think I can find one
for about 500 francs.

842
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,840
I'll sell it in the fall
for a profit.

843
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,240
But for that...

844
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:40,080
I'm asking you to make
a sacrifice.

845
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:45,880
That is, a temporary separation...

846
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:48,560
from your necklace...
if you agree.

847
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:50,080
To sell?

848
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:54,800
No, just to pawn it.
There's no risk involved.

849
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:58,920
They'll lend me 2,000 francs for it.
It's worth much more.

850
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:02,440
The mule will thrive
on the mountain air...

851
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:05,360
and in two months I'll resell it.

852
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:08,880
Then we'll get the necklace back.

853
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,920
That's all right,
isn't it, Mama?

854
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:13,840
Of course.

855
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:17,080
Time for bed.
Tomorrow is a big day.

856
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:30,600
Do you mind giving it up?

857
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:36,200
I already have.

858
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:43,840
- What?
- I've already pawned it.

859
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,360
- When?
- Last month.

860
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:56,160
I had no more money...

861
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:59,320
You bought many things...

862
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:02,440
books, tools,
bran for the rabbits.

863
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:07,240
And we drink lots of wine.

864
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:14,520
- How much did you get for it?
- 100 francs.

865
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:16,040
100 francs?

866
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:18,040
The emeralds were fakes.

867
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,920
Please, God, make it rain.

868
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:15,840
Please, God, make it rain.

869
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,600
In 20 minutes
the cistern will be full!

870
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:05,720
What a beautiful storm!

871
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:11,200
Manon! I felt the first drop!

872
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:14,440
Me too, Papa!

873
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:18,560
I want to feel this
blessed water on my face!

874
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:20,840
Thank you, God!

875
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,640
But it's raining over there!

876
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:41,080
The rain is over there!

877
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:49,320
I'm a hunchback!
Have you forgotten that?

878
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:51,160
Do you think it's easy?

879
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,880
Isn't there anybody up there?

880
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,560
There's nobody up there!

881
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,560
What is that?

882
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,400
Aimee, come, look!

883
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:38,760
Look!

884
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,000
Dear God, what is it?

885
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:45,040
A windstorm! I'll run
to the Plantier for water!

886
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:55,040
I have no time!
Meet me at the spring!

887
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:07,560
Hurry! It's a matter
of life and death!

888
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:11,640
Papa's sick!

889
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:13,120
Hurry!

890
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:24,000
Now I know why God
gave me this hump.

891
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:37,040
She says she'll take
the sun out of him.

892
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:40,880
She says if we don't
take the sun out, he'll die.

893
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:38,120
All that for some lousy squash.

894
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:41,160
It's awful to see them work
like slaves in this heat.

895
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:47,400
He just didn't plan it right.

896
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:50,160
His squash will never make it.

897
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:52,720
But he's got a spring
at Romarins.

898
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:55,080
It seems to be plugged up.

899
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:57,640
Maybe it didn't plug up
by itself.

900
01:32:57,680 --> 01:33:01,000
Maybe one should ask
the Soubeyrans. Maybe...

901
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:03,240
Never mind that.

902
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:06,600
The Soubeyrans do as they please
and so do we!

903
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:09,960
It doesn't pay to mind
other people's business!

904
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:12,480
The less talk, the better!

905
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:19,400
It's time for our move!

906
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:22,720
His fields are a disaster area.

907
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,600
He doesn't need to die, though.

908
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:27,920
Offer him six or seven thousand,
but haggle with him.

909
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,880
Let me kiss you, Papet!

910
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:32,800
Stop that!
Now hurry over there.

911
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:36,800
Wait! Bring him
this bottle of new wine.

912
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:39,320
It'll do him good.

913
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:47,960
Your wine is delicious,
but I have to face the facts.

914
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:50,000
My ventures failed.

915
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:53,080
It's a disaster.

916
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:56,840
I could blame it on fate...

917
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:59,120
or the unusual weather pattern...

918
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:03,880
but I'd rather blame
my own stupidity.

919
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:06,320
My lack of common sense.

920
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:11,760
I thought I was clever,
but, in fact, I was blind.

921
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:14,480
Blind to my biggest problem.

922
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:15,840
Water.

923
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:19,600
That's right.
Without water it won't work.

924
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:23,000
That's in the past.

925
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:25,920
Now, here's what I'm going to do.

926
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:30,920
When I've regained my strength...

927
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:33,080
I'll dig a well.

928
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:37,000
- Where?
- I'll use a divining rod.

929
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:38,400
Are you a dowser?

930
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:41,480
Not exactly.

931
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:48,680
But I have a special manual
that I'll study carefully.

932
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:52,680
I'll learn to use the rod...

933
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,880
and I'm sure I'll find water.

934
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:56,520
You know how to make a well?

935
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:01,360
After all, a well is just
a hole in the ground.

936
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:06,400
I'll make it 36 feet deep,
and even if I don't hit water...

937
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:08,480
my problem is solved.

938
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:11,600
What good is a dry well?

939
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:13,760
I'll use it as a cistern!

940
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:18,920
A well that size will hold
43 cubic meters of water!

941
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:21,280
Spring rains will fill it up.

942
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:25,440
In the summer months,
between this well and our cistern...

943
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:28,120
we'll have 55 cubic meters.

944
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:31,680
That gives us 36 days
of worry-free watering.

945
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:34,600
We've had longer dry spells.

946
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:38,560
Where does a drought last 36 days?

947
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:42,760
The Sahara? Maybe!

948
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:45,200
Or maybe in the Gobi Desert!

949
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:46,600
But not here!

950
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:52,480
It's mathematically impossible!

951
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:56,960
Let's drink!

952
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:05,080
From what you tell me...

953
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:07,520
the only good news
is that now...

954
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:15,160
he drinks red wine.

955
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:17,360
And the divining rod?

956
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:20,160
That's a nuisance.

957
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:23,200
Could his book
teach him the secret?

958
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:27,040
Hell, no. It's no secret.
It's a special touch.

959
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:31,040
- He might hire a real dowser.
- You know any?

960
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:32,640
I knew one in Ombrees.

961
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:34,240
If he came to Romarins...

962
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:38,320
he'd locate the spring in a flash!

963
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:40,680
Is he still in Ombrees?

964
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:44,160
Sure, but luckily
he's in the graveyard.

965
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,320
And then, a good dowser
is expensive.

966
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:50,080
Did you talk money?

967
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:53,920
Not yet. He was drunk.

968
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,360
I think he's got no money left.

969
01:36:57,280 --> 01:37:00,560
When it comes to money,
you can never be sure.

970
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:24,000
I thought it moved!

971
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:53,320
- How is it going?
- It's getting more difficult.

972
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:57,120
- Tough?
- It certainly is!

973
01:37:57,240 --> 01:38:00,320
I'm down to the white rock
I told you about!

974
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:02,440
- The Cartinary?
- Exactly!

975
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:07,200
If there's water under this rock,
I'll reach it in two weeks.

976
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:11,320
But if it's under
the Quaternary layer...

977
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:13,760
it'll take six months or more.

978
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:32,960
Now I know what
a ditchdigger's thirst is.

979
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:34,880
This hits the spot!

980
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:48,520
Monsieur Jean,
I have to be frank with you.

981
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:52,640
You may think
this is none of my business...

982
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,240
but I feel sorry for you.

983
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:57,920
All the work you've done
for the past two years...

984
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,880
It's madness. It'll kill you.

985
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:02,400
An interesting introduction.

986
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:06,400
You won't finish your well.

987
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:08,880
Even if you do, it's not enough.

988
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:11,360
You need a river
for all your corn and squash!

989
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:14,720
This is no life for you,
and that's the truth.

990
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,280
Go on. This is all
very interesting.

991
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:24,640
A man like you
belongs to the city.

992
01:39:24,760 --> 01:39:27,120
You're educated.
You could be a teacher...

993
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:30,720
or even a mailman
with a nice neat outfit.

994
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:32,640
That's what you're meant for.

995
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:36,360
If you stay here,
you'll kill yourself.

996
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:41,520
You're out of money... that's no crime.
But you're skimping.

997
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:46,080
Eating rabbit and dandelion
leaves you too weak for this work.

998
01:39:46,160 --> 01:39:48,320
Then you drink
too much red wine.

999
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:53,600
One day you'll just drop dead.

1000
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:58,440
How will your wife
and daughter manage then?

1001
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:02,120
They haven't been looking
too well lately.

1002
01:40:02,240 --> 01:40:03,640
I've noticed.

1003
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:19,960
What's this farm worth?

1004
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,800
To rent or sell?

1005
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:23,200
To sell.

1006
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:24,480
Just a minute.

1007
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:28,960
It's hard to say.
I hadn't thought about it.

1008
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:30,960
It's no summer residence...

1009
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:33,840
and without water,
it's no use to a farmer.

1010
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:39,160
The second cistern
will add to its value.

1011
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:41,000
Maybe. Maybe.

1012
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:44,280
Seven thousand.

1013
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:46,480
Is that all?

1014
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:51,120
Let's say eight thousand.

1015
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:53,920
You wouldn't sell
your mother's house!

1016
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:57,440
The price
is perfectly reasonable.

1017
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:02,000
It means I can ask our notary
for a 4,000 franc mortgage!

1018
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:03,520
Then you're not selling?

1019
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:05,000
Never!

1020
01:41:05,120 --> 01:41:08,480
I'll never sell the house
where I hope to live forever...

1021
01:41:08,640 --> 01:41:10,560
once we're rich!

1022
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:13,720
We can manage quite well
on 4,000 francs!

1023
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:19,200
I'll buy a mule and some
mining tools and dynamite...

1024
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:21,280
to blast this damn rock!

1025
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:24,840
In a year I'll pay off the mortgage
and we'll be set.

1026
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:30,680
You know what a mortgage is?

1027
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:34,560
It's when a notary lends money
to honest people who own property.

1028
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:36,680
What honest people?

1029
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:39,080
He'll have to sign
official papers.

1030
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:42,160
And if he doesn't pay on time...

1031
01:41:42,280 --> 01:41:44,160
they take his farm.

1032
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:48,120
All right,
now leave us alone.

1033
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:01,520
There's something good
and something bad.

1034
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:05,920
The bad part is,
if he gets 4,000 francs...

1035
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:08,720
his venture may succeed
next summer.

1036
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:12,480
On the other hand,
since he's a born loser...

1037
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:15,200
many things can go wrong.

1038
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:21,280
And dynamite and drinking
don't mix.

1039
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:26,720
In any case,
whoever owns the mortgage wins.

1040
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:30,280
So, I'll finance
his mortgage myself.

1041
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:34,600
If he succeeds,
he'll pay me interest...

1042
01:42:34,680 --> 01:42:36,960
and repay the loan.

1043
01:42:37,120 --> 01:42:38,680
And if he fails...

1044
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:41,440
we'll get the farm.

1045
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:45,760
You're smart, Papet,
real smart.

1046
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:50,800
I'm smart because I have money.

1047
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:22,840
It's all set!

1048
01:44:28,120 --> 01:44:29,440
You do the honors.

1049
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:48,760
Go, get Mama! I want her
to see the water shoot up!

1050
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:48,480
An accident?

1051
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:51,400
What happened?

1052
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:59,040
I ran to see the water
shoot up...

1053
01:45:59,160 --> 01:46:02,480
but some rocks
were blown sky-high...

1054
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:04,600
and landed on my head.

1055
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:09,080
If you can talk,
it's not too bad.

1056
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:24,720
It was a small rock, Doctor.

1057
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:42,400
When he tried to speak before,
he ground his teeth.

1058
01:46:48,640 --> 01:46:51,760
He didn't suffer before going
where we'll all go.

1059
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:57,480
The rock must have fractured
a cervical vertebra.

1060
01:46:58,240 --> 01:47:01,960
Even if I'd come sooner,
it wouldn't have helped.

1061
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:33,120
I just stopped the clock
at Monsieur Jean's house.

1062
01:47:37,120 --> 01:47:38,960
Is that why you're crying?

1063
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:46,600
It's not me that's crying.

1064
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,800
It's my eyes!

1065
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:32,200
What'll they do now?

1066
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:36,080
They must have relatives.
And they can sell the farm.

1067
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:39,400
And you might buy it
out of kindness?

1068
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:42,000
It depends.
What is it worth?

1069
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:46,320
Not much. In any case,
it wasn't worth a man's life.

1070
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:48,400
8,000 francs
is more than reasonable.

1071
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:52,600
If there were a water source,
it would be worth double.

1072
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:57,280
But there's only one cistern,
and the house is very old.

1073
01:49:57,360 --> 01:50:00,160
Once you pay off your mortgage...

1074
01:50:00,240 --> 01:50:02,560
and we deduct interest and fees...

1075
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:05,680
you'll be left with 3,880 francs.

1076
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:08,600
Sign here, please.

1077
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:12,720
And initial these.

1078
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:29,280
I must tell you that the buyer
has been very generous.

1079
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:32,240
You can continue to live here.

1080
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:36,640
He's renting it to me.
I'll only farm the land.

1081
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:39,680
This is your home.
I'll never come in without knocking.

1082
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:42,560
For me, this will always be
Monsieur Jean's house.

1083
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:13,720
I've clowned around enough.
Anyway, they're leaving.

1084
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:15,080
Let's go.

1085
01:51:56,280 --> 01:51:58,080
I think I've got it!

1086
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:02,720
There must be plenty
of water down there.

1087
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:17,480
Carnations, Galinette!

1088
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:19,600
15,000 francs a year!

1089
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:22,440
It's liquid gold!

1090
01:52:35,160 --> 01:52:37,040
What was that?

1091
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:38,400
Nothing!

1092
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:42,440
Just a hare
caught by a buzzard.

1093
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:13,720
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

1094
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:16,960
I hereby name you
King of Carnations!
