1
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:38,997
Welcome...
You are now inside of the painting.

2
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:41,082
It may look like time has stopped,

3
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:42,414
but that's not true.

4
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:44,869
Everyone's just holding their
breath in anticipation!

5
00:01:47,417 --> 00:01:49,909
Do you see that castle over there,
through the branches?

6
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:51,699
That's where you'll find the Alldunns.

7
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:54,241
They think they live in Paradise.

8
00:01:57,458 --> 00:02:01,122
And below them, in the shadows,
down by the foot of the blue tree...

9
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,706
are Ramo and Claire.

10
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:05,329
Can you see them?
They're in love.

11
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,540
But they have to meet in secret,

12
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:09,123
because Ramo is an Alldunn,

13
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,244
and my friend Claire is a "Halfie."

14
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:12,573
Like me!

15
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:14,411
Claire asked me to wait for her,

16
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:15,698
and that was an hour ago.

17
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:16,914
Now my foot's asleep!

18
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,495
I almost forgot.
There's also the "Sketchies."

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,035
Poor things.

20
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:24,954
I imagine their lives must be difficult.

21
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:28,530
So, in the end they all
look out for themselves.

22
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:30,657
Sorry, gotta go!

23
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,707
I also have a part to play in this story...

24
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:43,033
Can you see it?
- This way!

25
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:45,744
Hurry, it's getting away!

26
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,867
Over there! It's headed
toward the lake!

27
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,831
There he is!

28
00:03:05,917 --> 00:03:07,828
Little sneak! Got away!

29
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,244
We're never gonna find it in the forest!

30
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:12,408
Leave it. Who cares about a Sketchie?

31
00:03:40,792 --> 00:03:41,907
Did they catch it?

32
00:03:42,042 --> 00:03:44,704
No! Look, they've come
back empty-handed!

33
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,740
They are hard to see, after all.

34
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:49,955
Sketchies!
They're nothing but failed scratches!

35
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:52,124
Mistakes, really.
- They should be tossed in the trash.

36
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,740
Indeed.

37
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:57,371
How the Painter left such disgusting
things around is beyond me.

38
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,412
They were his first drawings.
Research, if you will...

39
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,536
They're repugnant.
He should have erased them!

40
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:05,749
I just don't want them
near the castle.

41
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,457
Yes, but our youngsters need
something to chase!

42
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:11,158
Quill, will you look at that!

43
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,666
I've never seen anything so beautiful!

44
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:15,823
Lower your voice!

45
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,198
Do you want to get caught?

46
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,365
We shouldn't be here.

47
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,992
Look, the stairs!
They're way over there!

48
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:39,034
That color suits you beautifully, my dear.

49
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,040
You're rather fetching, yourself.

50
00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:45,328
Look, over there!

51
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,865
It's a Halfie!

52
00:04:50,167 --> 00:04:52,124
Has she no self-respect?

53
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,332
I highly doubt she'll
be allowed up here!

54
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:55,368
Please...

55
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:56,865
I'm not so different.

56
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,164
I'm practically done!

57
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,040
Give it a rest! Get out of here!

58
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,958
You must completely painted
in order to be an Alldunn!

59
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,414
I know, but...
- Now begone!

60
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:13,786
Really. How long will it take them to learn
that they are not allowed in the castle?

61
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,116
And the garden is quite large, is it not?

62
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,911
They have all the space they need.

63
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:20,203
There's only one way 
to make them understand.

64
00:05:20,542 --> 00:05:22,078
And I hope it happens tonight.

65
00:06:04,292 --> 00:06:05,623
Do you hear them?

66
00:06:06,292 --> 00:06:07,828
They're so hateful.

67
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:09,998
How far will they go?

68
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:11,868
I'm scared.

69
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,289
I won't let them hurt you.

70
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,706
I'm not scared for me.

71
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,244
I'm scared for us.

72
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,582
All day I wait for night,

73
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,866
but at night we have to
hide in the shadows!

74
00:06:22,042 --> 00:06:24,955
I can hardly see your face.
- I can see yours, Claire.

75
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,786
What does it look like?

76
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:27,907
Tell me.

77
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,037
It's beautiful, yet simple.

78
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:34,663
Your eyes are perfect blue ovals,
like pools of water.

79
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,244
Your cheeks are golden, like the sun,

80
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:38,531
and your lips...

81
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:40,452
are the color of that flower -

82
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,494
pink, with a touch of crimson.

83
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:45,624
They have color?
- Of course!

84
00:06:46,292 --> 00:06:48,249
Oh, Ramo, hold me tight!

85
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,453
Now tell me more lies.

86
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,994
Tell me that one day
we can be together.

87
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,411
But they're not lies, Claire.

88
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,536
The Painter is going to come back.

89
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:57,990
And if he doesn't,

90
00:06:58,542 --> 00:07:00,909
I'll go the ends of the Earth
to find him.

91
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,740
He'll finish the painting.

92
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,164
Claire, we have to go!
- Lola's right, you can't stay.

93
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,366
I'll meet you by the lake, later tonight.

94
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:10,581
Please come with us!

95
00:07:11,042 --> 00:07:13,204
I can't. I have to get back for the speech.

96
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,081
Besides, the Halfies don't like me.

97
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,324
Claire!
- Go with Lola.

98
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,581
I love you.

99
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,790
There he is!
- He's about to speak!

100
00:07:57,167 --> 00:08:00,239
My dear friends, my brothers and sisters!

101
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:03,496
You have chosen me to represent
and protect your interests.

102
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,951
And so it falls on me,
to say the difficult truths...

103
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,699
though it's what everyone's been thinking!

104
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,662
The Painter is not going to come back!

105
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,541
At last, someone with the courage 
to speak the truth.

106
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:16,453
We must come to terms with this.

107
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:18,078
This is his decision!

108
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:21,325
Which means that we are 
his chosen creations.

109
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:25,247
You see, we are his only complete
and perfect works of art...

110
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:27,328
the culmination of his vision!

111
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:34,994
Which means that he has chosen us to
rule over and bring order to his kingdom!

112
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:35,663
He's right!

113
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,164
We must rule over the Halfies!

114
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,706
I'm so glad to hear it.

115
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:40,453
We shouldn't even have
to look at them!

116
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,369
Finally, some honesty
around here...

117
00:08:42,542 --> 00:08:43,873
I completely agree...

118
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,700
After all, there's only so
much room in our castle.

119
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,621
There's no way we can be expected to
share it with those who are inferior.

120
00:08:49,792 --> 00:08:51,658
Let them live out there in the gardens...
- Or the forest.

121
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,581
In the forest?
- Why not?

122
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,700
It's a logical decision!
Who could fault us for doing it?

123
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,240
Me!

124
00:08:58,917 --> 00:08:59,748
Who is that?

125
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,448
That's Ramo.

126
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,790
You know, the one who's
with that Halfie girl...

127
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:06,999
What makes you think the
Alldunns are actually superior?

128
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:11,122
I think it's fairly obvious, don't you?
The Painter chose to complete us.

129
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,286
And how would you know what he thinks?

130
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:14,869
Are you speaking to him?

131
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:19,285
Listen to me! We have no idea
why the Painter disappeared.

132
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:20,577
No one here does!

133
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:22,328
There's still a chance
that he'll come back,

134
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,495
and when he does, he'll
finish the Painting!

135
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:25,782
He's not coming back!

136
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,331
He's just a child! What does he know?

137
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,290
You're proud of your appearances,
I understand that,

138
00:09:30,417 --> 00:09:32,624
but your words are fueled
by shame, and hate!

139
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,366
We should blot out from
our minds our differences,

140
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,956
and focus on how we
are the same!

141
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,120
Don't paint us in such a bad light.
- Very shady!

142
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,163
What's good about a Sketchie?
- I'm drawing a blank!

143
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:44,783
Alright! Enough, my friends!

144
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,996
Our Ramo is just trying to
justify his love affair.

145
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,786
An affair with a Halfie!

146
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:52,534
It's understandable,
since you're so young.

147
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,746
But just because we understand it,
doesn't mean we accept it!

148
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,575
The days of blissful idealism are over,
young man!

149
00:09:58,917 --> 00:10:02,160
Equality and liberty,
sharing the castle with all!

150
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:05,041
If we let in Halfies, why not
Sketchies and animals?

151
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,073
Where does it end?

152
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:08,624
Let go of me! Don't listen to him!

153
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,206
All he's interested in is power!

154
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,869
The Painter will be back!

155
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,414
Oh yes, he'll be back.

156
00:10:13,542 --> 00:10:15,499
Why should we think otherwise?

157
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:17,999
Believe me when I tell you this,

158
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,788
there is no shame in
being superior, my friends.

159
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,332
Are we not the most beautiful?

160
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,457
Yes, my pretty little things,

161
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,618
for you are the light that
illuminates this castle!

162
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,116
Long live the Great Chandelier!
- Well said!

163
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:38,490
A Sketchie!
- Get it!

164
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:39,410
Get it!

165
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:54,829
Stop it! What is wrong with you?

166
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:58,163
That boy may prove to be dangerous,
Mr. Graymorgan.

167
00:10:58,542 --> 00:11:00,749
He can be taken care of,
Great Chandelier.

168
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,990
Can you hear that?

169
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,448
Sounds like trouble.

170
00:11:44,292 --> 00:11:46,454
They're getting each other
more and more worked up.

171
00:11:46,542 --> 00:11:47,407
The savages...

172
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:48,578
Who do they think they are?

173
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,448
You should have seen the way 
they treated me!

174
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:51,948
Why do you try to be like them?

175
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:55,288
Because it isn't fair.
I want to dance, too!

176
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,449
From the way that it sounds,

177
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,162
there isn't going to be anymore 
dancing tonight.

178
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,241
Do you know what he said to me tonight?

179
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,491
That my mouth was pink and rosy!

180
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:10,659
It was so sweet!
I almost believed him.

181
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,290
You're lucky. He loves you...

182
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,036
Why bother making up stories'?

183
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,457
Because stories are beautiful!

184
00:12:19,042 --> 00:12:20,498
Life is so dreary here.

185
00:12:20,917 --> 00:12:22,499
We just have to keep quiet,
like they want.

186
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,453
It's the Sketchies they're after.

187
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,073
Those things are everywhere.

188
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:29,159
You can hardly see them.
That's how they get away with it!

189
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,664
Listen to them...

190
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,749
They just wish that they were Alldunns!

191
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,164
<i>To be honest, so do I...</i>

192
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:35,953
I'm pretty happy with the way I am.

193
00:12:36,292 --> 00:12:37,953
You only say that because
you're not in love.

194
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,574
When you love someone,
you're not alone.

195
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,790
There is you, and there is him,

196
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,413
and you want to be together,
to be free, out in the open,

197
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,990
accepted by everyone!

198
00:12:48,542 --> 00:12:50,533
I can't say I really understand.

199
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,620
All I know is, my destiny
lies somewhere else.

200
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,909
Don't be silly, Lola.
Where could you possibly go?

201
00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,615
There isn't anywhere else.

202
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,324
I mean, there's the castle, and the garden,

203
00:13:02,542 --> 00:13:03,327
and that's it!

204
00:13:04,042 --> 00:13:05,624
Other than the forest.

205
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:06,698
The forest!

206
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,991
We don't really know
anything about it.

207
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,040
Who knows what's there?

208
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,369
Where are you going?

209
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,117
To meet Ramo.
He's waiting for me.

210
00:13:16,292 --> 00:13:17,373
Where are you off to?

211
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:18,493
None of your business.

212
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,206
She's meeting her boyfriend!

213
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:20,913
What's it to you'?

214
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,657
You of all people should understand!

215
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:24,533
Lola's right. This isn't the castle.

216
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:25,743
We should let her go.

217
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:26,993
<i>He'll expose us.</i>

218
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,707
He's an Alldunn, like the others.

219
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,699
No, he's not like them!

220
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,831
He'll worry if I don't show.

221
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,832
Don't worry. Stay calm.

222
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,700
We'll wait.
You can sneak out later.

223
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,411
Gum!

224
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:53,532
Gum!

225
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:13,657
Oh, no!

226
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,786
What have they done to you?

227
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,740
Monsters!

228
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,116
What... Look at you...

229
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,457
You poor, poor idiot!

230
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:29,698
No...

231
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,032
No!

232
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,241
Ramo? Is that you?

233
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:05,748
You scared me half to death!

234
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,412
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
- I don't need your help!

235
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,081
Where's Claire?

236
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,164
She couldn't come.

237
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,374
The other Halfies refused to let her leave.

238
00:15:20,542 --> 00:15:21,782
They're against us, too?

239
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:22,743
We have to get her.

240
00:15:24,042 --> 00:15:25,658
Wait... Is that a Sketchie?

241
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,198
They're after him, too.

242
00:15:28,042 --> 00:15:30,124
There they are!
I see them! I see them!

243
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:41,499
Where are you going?
- I don't know.

244
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:42,702
This is the wrong way!

245
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:43,573
It's not me!

246
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:44,990
The current's too strong!

247
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,957
Current? The lake doesn't have a current!

248
00:15:48,292 --> 00:15:50,249
Well, whatever it is, 
it's pulling the boat!

249
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:56,830
Hey! What are you doing?
We're heading towards the...

250
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,411
The forbidden forest!

251
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,331
The Death Flowers!

252
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,411
What a horrible fate!

253
00:16:06,542 --> 00:16:07,748
They're as good as dead.

254
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,912
I almost feel sorry for them! Almost.

255
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,073
We made it!

256
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,957
There you are. What did you find out?

257
00:17:50,042 --> 00:17:51,953
I followed them as far as the forest.

258
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:52,663
Then what?

259
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:54,783
Uh...
- Did they manage to escape?

260
00:17:55,292 --> 00:17:56,453
No, I don't think so...

261
00:17:56,917 --> 00:17:58,203
The flowers swallowed them up.

262
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,572
There were three of them:
Lola, a Sketchie, and...

263
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,578
that young Alldun.

264
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,249
No! It's not true!

265
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:08,953
Why would you say that?

266
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:27,414
We got through!

267
00:18:27,917 --> 00:18:29,282
I didn't think we'd make it!

268
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,416
The flowers didn't eat us.
That was a lie!

269
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,786
People make up such stupid stories.

270
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,824
That's no more stupid
than getting into your boat!

271
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:39,823
How will I find Claire now?

272
00:18:40,417 --> 00:18:43,034
Hey, it's not my fault.
I was trying to help you!

273
00:18:43,917 --> 00:18:45,703
You okay?
Are you hurt?

274
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,956
Leave me alone!

275
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:49,748
And him too!

276
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,206
Tell him not to come near me!

277
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:52,032
He won't hurt you!

278
00:18:54,292 --> 00:18:56,408
Don't touch my stuff!
- Okay, I'm sorry!

279
00:18:59,042 --> 00:19:00,749
We'll never get anywhere like this.

280
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,536
Claire's back there with those lunatics,

281
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,449
and we're stuck in the
middle of nowhere!

282
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,207
If the Painter could see us now...

283
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,865
Well, let's go find him!

284
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:13,451
And let's say we do. What makes you
think he gives a damn about us?

285
00:19:14,792 --> 00:19:17,910
I say we go for it. It's something
I've been wanting to do.

286
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,790
We can tell him what's happening!

287
00:19:19,917 --> 00:19:21,703
Then he can finally finish painting 
the Halfies!

288
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,119
And don't forget about the Sketchies!

289
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,540
Yeah, them too.
- Thanks for remembering!

290
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,662
I'm sure he's just been
really busy, you know...

291
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:29,743
Alright, then...

292
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,331
Where should we start looking?

293
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:36,280
Well, no one's ever searched in
the forbidden forest before.

294
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,289
Why don't we look here?

295
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,457
But which direction? It all seems the same.

296
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:41,868
I vote this way!

297
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,913
I don't know. This way seems better.
- It's probably a dead-end...

298
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,073
OK, listen, you two!

299
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,573
It doesn't matter which way we go,

300
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,119
as long as it's away from the castle.

301
00:20:32,917 --> 00:20:34,828
Hey... Help! Can't you wait?

302
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:38,124
He's stuck in the creepers again.

303
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,948
Why does he have
so much trouble?

304
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:40,872
I don't know.

305
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:42,498
Maybe because he's a Sketchie?

306
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:45,204
Don't you find it annoying?
- Imagine how he feels.

307
00:20:45,917 --> 00:20:47,373
Come on. Let me get you out of there.

308
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,950
I know, I know! I hold you back.

309
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,871
I'm always getting caught
in these damn vines!

310
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,165
Careful! You're hurting me!

311
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,911
Go. Leave.

312
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:01,664
Hey, watch it!

313
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,615
Have it your way.

314
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:03,869
You can stay right there.

315
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,745
Wait! If you do happen to find him,

316
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:10,118
can you please tell him
that I have a favor to ask?

317
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:04,000
Hey! I think we've been here before...

318
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,073
He's right. I think we're
just going around in circles.

319
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:09,493
That can't be right.

320
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:10,953
I think we are!

321
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,411
We have to try to stay together.

322
00:23:51,167 --> 00:23:53,283
I'm light, light as a feather!

323
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,536
Look, watch this!

324
00:23:58,875 --> 00:23:59,455
Lola!

325
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:02,958
You're going too far!
We can't see you anymore!

326
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:04,368
Lola!

327
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:31,578
Lola! Where are you?

328
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:32,830
Oh, no.

329
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:35,704
I'm down here, hanging on something.

330
00:24:36,167 --> 00:24:36,998
Can you see her?

331
00:24:37,417 --> 00:24:39,408
Yes, at the bottom! She's...

332
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:42,040
Ramo!
- I see you.

333
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:46,619
Are you okay?
- I'm fine!

334
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,661
Don't move! Stay where you are.

335
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,910
We're coming down.

336
00:25:54,625 --> 00:25:56,787
What do you think you're doing?
Return to your posts!

337
00:25:57,417 --> 00:25:59,374
What is this? Back in line!

338
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:09,452
Who is that?

339
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:12,324
Bring me that girl!
- What girl?

340
00:26:13,292 --> 00:26:14,327
There she is!

341
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:32,208
Quill! I'm going to need some more rope!

342
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:33,823
You were supposed to stay up there!

343
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,412
Too scary! I was afraid to be alone...

344
00:26:36,792 --> 00:26:38,078
So I came down.

345
00:26:38,417 --> 00:26:39,703
Well, hang on then.

346
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:54,949
We've got a little spy!

347
00:26:55,167 --> 00:26:56,373
Did the Greens send you?

348
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:58,870
No! I'm actually from another painting.

349
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,911
It's hanging right above yours.

350
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,706
The string broke and I wound up here.

351
00:27:03,167 --> 00:27:04,999
A painting? That's ridiculous!

352
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,995
Look. I didn't mean to disturb you.

353
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:09,448
I'm sorry if I caused you trouble.

354
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:10,911
Is this your idea of a joke?

355
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:12,744
But I'm telling you the truth.

356
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:15,583
You're in a painting.
A painting about war!

357
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,582
War is nothing to joke about!

358
00:27:19,917 --> 00:27:21,749
You may think that you're in a painting...

359
00:27:22,167 --> 00:27:25,660
but when you're in front of the firing squad,
it won't be a pretty picture.

360
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:27,244
You're even worse than the Alldunns!

361
00:27:27,458 --> 00:27:29,415
Captain, the Greens are in 
battle formation.

362
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,207
They don't waste any time, do they?

363
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:32,789
Magenta, Ruby!

364
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:34,323
Keep an eye on this spy.

365
00:27:43,917 --> 00:27:45,578
How come we've never seen you around here?

366
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,957
It's useless explaining.
You won't believe me!

367
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,206
How do you know?

368
00:27:49,458 --> 00:27:50,744
Don't listen to her, she's a liar.

369
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:53,207
We're all in a painting of a battle,

370
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:55,036
and I don't intend to stick around.

371
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:56,163
Magenta!

372
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:57,956
You'll be drumming during the charge.

373
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,490
The charge...

374
00:28:02,042 --> 00:28:03,624
I'm so sick of this war.

375
00:28:05,042 --> 00:28:06,703
I don't even know what we're fighting for.

376
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:09,915
Are you sure that
there's a way out of here?

377
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:11,282
Yes, I'm positive.

378
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:12,782
Untie me. You'll see.

379
00:28:13,417 --> 00:28:16,409
I think she may be telling the truth.
- You heard the Captain!

380
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:19,365
What do you think you're doing?

381
00:28:19,792 --> 00:28:20,497
Stay where you are!

382
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:04,990
Where have you been?

383
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:07,457
And where did he come from?

384
00:29:07,917 --> 00:29:08,907
His name is Magenta.

385
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:11,704
He helped me escape.
He's coming with us now.

386
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:15,040
Oh, sorry, I didn't see you there!

387
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,581
Go ahead! Sure!

388
00:29:16,792 --> 00:29:18,123
Be my guest. I'm used to it.

389
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:20,866
Quill is fragile, 
so you have to be careful.

390
00:29:21,042 --> 00:29:21,907
I'm sorry, Quill.

391
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:24,616
Wow, your nose really is fragile!

392
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:11,623
What is this place?

393
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:13,706
What are we doing here?

394
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,365
It looks completely deserted.

395
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:20,157
He could be away...

396
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,456
on a long trip.

397
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:22,993
Maybe he's nearby.

398
00:30:23,292 --> 00:30:25,329
You know, listening to us.

399
00:30:26,292 --> 00:30:28,454
Sure, that sounds likely!

400
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:31,495
I can't believe we came all this way 
for nothing!

401
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,582
Wow. Your friend sure is grumpy.

402
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:36,040
No, no, life's good!
Trust me.

403
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,366
I escape those homicidal maniacs,

404
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,116
only to end up in this wasteland!

405
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:43,791
What a dump. No wonder it's abandoned!

406
00:30:59,917 --> 00:31:01,749
Lola?
- Yeah?

407
00:31:01,917 --> 00:31:02,657
If we find him...

408
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:05,699
What do you think we
should say to him?

409
00:31:05,917 --> 00:31:07,954
Ramo thinks he hasn't finished
painting us yet.

410
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:15,874
I would ask him
why he painted a battle.

411
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,706
I would have painted the sea!

412
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:20,120
I have always wanted
to visit the sea.

413
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:22,163
And you?

414
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:23,823
What would you ask him?

415
00:31:24,292 --> 00:31:26,533
Me? I don't know.

416
00:31:27,292 --> 00:31:29,624
There are so many things
I've yet to understand!

417
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:33,166
Like, what makes us happy sometimes
and what makes us sad...

418
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:40,953
Claire.

419
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:44,371
What's wrong with him?
- He's in love.

420
00:31:44,708 --> 00:31:47,166
Will the Painter help him
with that, too?

421
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,410
She's alive!

422
00:32:49,042 --> 00:32:51,204
Great Chandelier, Sir,
I had her followed.

423
00:32:51,542 --> 00:32:53,328
She always comes out of the forest smiling.

424
00:32:54,417 --> 00:32:56,909
I think Ramo must still be alive.

425
00:32:57,042 --> 00:33:00,205
I guess the Death Flowers didn't
like the taste of the boy.

426
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,331
That's odd...

427
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,411
I wonder...

428
00:33:04,792 --> 00:33:07,454
Do you think something
is protecting them?

429
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,457
Why, love is their protection.

430
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:11,330
Love?

431
00:33:11,833 --> 00:33:13,540
Indeed, it's love!

432
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:16,870
Now then, I think we have a cure 
for that...

433
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:20,618
Whatever you desire shall be done,
Great Chandelier.

434
00:33:26,042 --> 00:33:28,033
Look how tiny they are!

435
00:33:28,625 --> 00:33:31,822
Who's there?
Did you hear that?

436
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:34,074
No...
- I heard something.

437
00:33:34,792 --> 00:33:36,453
It came from there, behind the sheet.

438
00:34:23,917 --> 00:34:25,032
Hello!

439
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:26,915
Hello, Madam!

440
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:30,621
Madam! Please, call me Florence.

441
00:34:31,417 --> 00:34:32,782
And who are you?

442
00:34:34,292 --> 00:34:35,782
You tell her, Lola.

443
00:34:35,917 --> 00:34:39,285
Okay. Well, um, we came here
to look for the Painter!

444
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:43,030
We want to know if he's ever going
to come back and finish our painting.

445
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:45,332
It's strange that he left you!

446
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,458
I thought he always finished his work,
down to the very last detail.

447
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:50,914
Take my dress, for example.

448
00:34:51,917 --> 00:34:53,783
But... you're completely nude.

449
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:56,617
Oh, of course.
What was I thinking?

450
00:34:58,875 --> 00:34:59,990
Who's there?

451
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:02,204
Looks like we've woken up Harlequin!

452
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:07,413
Hi there!

453
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:08,823
Did you come to play with me?

454
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:11,165
Actually, we're looking for the Painter.

455
00:35:11,833 --> 00:35:14,541
And you know not where he is,
nor where he isn't.

456
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:16,533
If he's small, or if he's tall.

457
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,491
And if you meet him, would you greet him?

458
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,707
For how would you know
if it was him at all?

459
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:23,786
And how about you, young man?

460
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:24,489
Would you know?

461
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:26,995
I'm no young man.
Call me Harlequin, you can.

462
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:29,579
And where the Painter be,
you shall see!

463
00:35:31,208 --> 00:35:32,164
He's on the easel.

464
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:33,785
He's right here.

465
00:35:36,792 --> 00:35:39,284
Is that him?
- The Painter!

466
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:41,948
Him? The Painter?

467
00:35:42,292 --> 00:35:43,407
Unfortunately, no.

468
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:45,373
Just a self-portrait.

469
00:35:46,583 --> 00:35:48,950
Well done!
Now everyone's awake.

470
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:51,165
I was quite enjoying my solitude.

471
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:53,241
My friends and I are just
looking for the Painter.

472
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:54,990
Sorry if we disturbed you.

473
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:56,999
What did he do, abandon you?

474
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:58,073
I'm not surprised.

475
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,491
He always leaves
behind his creations!

476
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:02,870
Even those he claims to love the most.

477
00:36:03,167 --> 00:36:05,078
What makes you think the Painter 
wants to see you?

478
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,958
Why would you say that?
- We didn't mean to make you angry.

479
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,241
I'm always angry! I cannot act
any other way.

480
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,332
I cannot act any other way.

481
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:14,494
So don't expect me to
be nice to you.

482
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,035
Because it's impossible!

483
00:36:16,292 --> 00:36:17,532
True, true, always blue!

484
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:19,787
No. When he drew me,
he was in a good mood.

485
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:22,825
I remember it well.
Those were better times.

486
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:25,540
And then suddenly things changed...

487
00:36:25,958 --> 00:36:27,790
He became bitter and sullen.

488
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,536
You can thank our friend here for that!

489
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:33,910
Look at her! 
The Madam is still quite smitten.

490
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:37,416
It's true. You should hear her
go on and on about him!

491
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:40,955
Oh, come now. You're just jealous!
- There they go, filled with woe.

492
00:36:41,292 --> 00:36:44,034
Always arguing, don't you know?
- Waiting in vain for his return!

493
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:46,283
Just you wait. Bitter old man!

494
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:49,075
But where is he?
Where can we find him?

495
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:50,539
I hate him!

496
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:54,583
Which means that I must
also hate myself.

497
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:58,997
Do you have any idea how difficult it is
to have feelings that are not your own?

498
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:01,949
I'd just like to be myself, for once.

499
00:37:02,625 --> 00:37:04,582
Is that too much to ask?

500
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:09,704
Lola, you're rather attractive yourself!

501
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:11,457
He must have liked you.

502
00:37:11,917 --> 00:37:13,248
Uh... I don't...

503
00:37:13,417 --> 00:37:16,034
Oh, don't be shy.
Here. Come closer.

504
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:19,905
I want to tell you a story.

505
00:37:21,917 --> 00:37:24,375
Once upon a time, he liked me, too.

506
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:25,618
Even loved me.

507
00:37:26,042 --> 00:37:28,374
Oh, he never said it
but I knew.

508
00:37:29,167 --> 00:37:31,750
Once, he even dipped his
brush in his coffee

509
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,374
and drank from his turpentine.

510
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,332
He was so distracted!

511
00:37:40,542 --> 00:37:42,408
His brush was so soft.

512
00:37:42,917 --> 00:37:44,373
His eyes were so gentle!

513
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:47,241
First, he'd outline my shape,

514
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,412
then he'd choose the color
of my eyes,

515
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:52,699
and my skin, my hair,

516
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:56,072
paying attention to every detail
of my body.

517
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:58,540
He gave me lacy underwear,

518
00:37:59,792 --> 00:38:02,864
and, finally, a beautiful dress.

519
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:05,415
The Painter had style, that's for sure!

520
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:07,749
So then what happened to your dress?

521
00:38:08,042 --> 00:38:11,080
I thought I was done, that
his work was complete,

522
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:14,075
but one day, he picked up
his brushes again

523
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:19,286
he came to me and removed all
my clothes, one piece at a time!

524
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,707
Oh my goodness!
Did you say anything?

525
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:24,412
Actually, I found it quite enjoyable.

526
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:26,744
Well I think you look beautiful like this!

527
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:28,865
And he did as well!

528
00:38:29,125 --> 00:38:33,164
So what happened to him?
Do you have any idea where he could be?

529
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,661
He might have gone back to Venice.

530
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:38,578
He always loved Venice.

531
00:38:39,167 --> 00:38:42,660
Uh... is Venice another woman?
- No. Venice is a city.

532
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:44,699
It's a dream-like place.

533
00:38:44,792 --> 00:38:46,408
Men may love their women,

534
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:48,536
but they love their dreams even more.

535
00:38:48,792 --> 00:38:52,365
And so do you know how to get there?
- It's closer than you think.

536
00:39:05,917 --> 00:39:07,499
Oh no! Lola!

537
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:09,994
Where are you going?

538
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,786
Wait for us!

539
00:40:55,542 --> 00:40:58,250
Quill? Are you there?
- Yeah. Can't you see me?

540
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,582
No. I can't see a thing!

541
00:41:20,792 --> 00:41:21,623
Look!

542
00:41:22,292 --> 00:41:23,282
Oh, no!

543
00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:29,948
Who did this?

544
00:41:31,208 --> 00:41:32,118
It's obvious...

545
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:34,414
The Painter, of course!

546
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:38,953
Do you think he'd destroy us, too?

547
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:48,452
I don't know.

548
00:41:49,167 --> 00:41:51,249
But at least we know
he really exists!

549
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:52,949
And Lola went to search for him!

550
00:41:53,375 --> 00:41:54,536
We have to warn her!

551
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:42,039
That's enough for me!

552
00:42:42,208 --> 00:42:44,290
Will they keep dancing
like this all day long?

553
00:42:45,292 --> 00:42:47,283
Yes! And again tomorrow...

554
00:42:47,667 --> 00:42:48,873
day after that, too!

555
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,916
It's always a never-ending
Carnival around here.

556
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:53,789
But you're not from here, are you?

557
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:11,869
Hey! What'd you think you're doing?

558
00:43:12,583 --> 00:43:13,789
You're not the Painter!

559
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:16,290
What'd you mean I'm not the painter?
What'd you think that is?

560
00:43:16,792 --> 00:43:19,659
A forgery!
- A forgery!

561
00:43:19,917 --> 00:43:21,578
I'll teach you a lesson, little girl!

562
00:43:25,083 --> 00:43:27,541
You can't be the Painter.
You don't even look like him!

563
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,833
Ignorant little girl! You don't even
know what I look like.

564
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:34,868
Everyone here has to wear a mask.
Those are the rules!

565
00:43:35,292 --> 00:43:36,908
They do? I didn't know that.

566
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:39,916
You don't know much, do you?
- Then take off your mask!

567
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:49,121
Hey! Wait! Where are you
going? Don't leave!

568
00:43:56,417 --> 00:43:57,953
Look at all these people!

569
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:00,865
We're never going to find them!

570
00:44:01,167 --> 00:44:03,499
We have to!
They have to know the truth.

571
00:44:03,667 --> 00:44:06,079
What if he's already erased them?

572
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:14,038
Watch it!

573
00:45:14,458 --> 00:45:16,995
Why is everyone so interested
in that painting?

574
00:45:17,292 --> 00:45:20,125
Are you the one who painted this?
- I would've finished it too,

575
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:21,698
except she ran away!

576
00:45:22,167 --> 00:45:25,034
Pretty looking girl, but she
just wouldn't stand still!

577
00:45:25,542 --> 00:45:27,579
Could it be that you're interested
in the painting, Monsieur?

578
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:30,492
L's only half done.
- Oh, I can fix that.

579
00:45:31,292 --> 00:45:35,490
And I'll give you a good price for it, too.
I usually refuse to work from memory,

580
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:37,954
but we'll just fill in a few strokes...

581
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:39,785
It won't take long.

582
00:45:40,417 --> 00:45:41,748
I'm pretty good with colors,

583
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:42,994
if I do say so myself,

584
00:45:43,375 --> 00:45:45,412
But it's capturing the movement
that's the hardest part!

585
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:49,246
Do you have any idea where she went?
- Not a clue! it's like she vanished.

586
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:51,581
So, do you still want it'?

587
00:45:56,375 --> 00:45:57,615
Oh, suit yourself!

588
00:45:57,958 --> 00:45:59,574
Don't know why I bother.

589
00:46:24,708 --> 00:46:25,948
Help!

590
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:35,956
Tell me, Mr. Graymorgan,
how is our honored guest faring?

591
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,707
She screams and she yells.

592
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:41,412
It is not a pleasant sound.

593
00:46:43,042 --> 00:46:46,285
Wonderful news, indeed.
I'm glad to hear it!

594
00:46:47,083 --> 00:46:49,916
Love may be blind,
but it does have ears...

595
00:46:51,792 --> 00:46:54,033
Ramo should be showing his face soon.

596
00:46:54,375 --> 00:46:56,707
Begin the preparations for the ceremony.

597
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:52,574
Lola!

598
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:55,951
Where have you been?
The Painter, he's this way!

599
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:58,494
Wait, don't go! It's dangerous!

600
00:47:59,708 --> 00:48:02,325
What? I can't hear you!

601
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:10,536
Follow it, the gondola!

602
00:48:33,417 --> 00:48:35,283
Hey! Where are you going?

603
00:49:37,958 --> 00:49:39,665
Here we are, young lady.

604
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:41,582
This is where
you'll find your painter!

605
00:49:42,333 --> 00:49:43,289
Oh no!

606
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:45,411
Look at that!

607
00:49:46,125 --> 00:49:47,786
There are so many of them.

608
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,494
Why, of course! They come here
every evening to paint the sunset.

609
00:49:55,583 --> 00:49:58,371
No. I don't believe it!

610
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:00,331
He would never do that!

611
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:04,160
But it's true. They were everywhere,
torn, ripped and burned!

612
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:05,828
And shredded with knives!

613
00:50:06,167 --> 00:50:07,657
He couldn't have.

614
00:50:08,792 --> 00:50:12,080
Look at that sunset.
See how beautiful it is?

615
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:14,662
The colors, melting into the water...

616
00:50:14,875 --> 00:50:16,411
Sentimental and contrived!

617
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,491
He should stop painting this rubbish.

618
00:50:19,667 --> 00:50:22,159
It's not rubbish!
He's expressing his feelings.

619
00:50:22,542 --> 00:50:24,579
When he's sad, he paints sad,

620
00:50:25,292 --> 00:50:27,784
and when he's in love,
he paints Florence.

621
00:50:28,292 --> 00:50:31,125
He can't find her in the real world,
so he paints her.

622
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:33,741
Yeah. And then he chops her to pieces.

623
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:35,536
I'm not sure I want to meet him anymore!

624
00:50:35,917 --> 00:50:37,624
Well, you don't have to worry about that.

625
00:50:38,333 --> 00:50:39,164
Why not?

626
00:50:39,375 --> 00:50:40,581
Because he isn't here.

627
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:41,910
We're inside his painting,

628
00:50:42,833 --> 00:50:45,996
and he can't very well be inside
his own painting, now, can he?

629
00:50:46,583 --> 00:50:47,618
What about them?

630
00:50:47,958 --> 00:50:49,995
They're only painting
what he's already painted.

631
00:50:50,875 --> 00:50:52,081
This is confusing.

632
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,535
Here's a thought.

633
00:50:54,292 --> 00:50:55,532
What if we don't need him?

634
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:59,411
Now, where did I put that thing?

635
00:51:01,208 --> 00:51:03,074
Oh! My dress!
- Nicely done.

636
00:51:03,625 --> 00:51:04,660
That's just what I was looking for.

637
00:51:07,625 --> 00:51:09,912
So? it's a tube of paint.

638
00:51:10,542 --> 00:51:13,079
Of course! And with that we can...

639
00:51:13,542 --> 00:51:16,705
We'll need to find a lot more of it.
And we'll also need to practice.

640
00:51:17,917 --> 00:51:22,241
Hey, would you two mind filling us
in on what you're talking about?

641
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,495
Well, look who's returned!

642
00:54:59,708 --> 00:55:01,324
Did you have a good time?

643
00:55:01,458 --> 00:55:04,246
You can't just climb around
wherever you want! Shoo!

644
00:55:05,917 --> 00:55:07,453
What is that?

645
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:08,581
It's yellow.

646
00:55:09,292 --> 00:55:12,205
It's all over my dress.
Can you fix it?

647
00:55:13,458 --> 00:55:14,823
Let me try something...

648
00:55:16,583 --> 00:55:18,324
It worked!
- Beautiful!

649
00:55:18,625 --> 00:55:21,913
Really? You think?
- You actually know how to paint!

650
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,537
Hmph. Funny, I've never
attempted it!

651
00:55:25,125 --> 00:55:26,411
Hey, that's not too bad.

652
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:27,956
Could you teach us?

653
00:55:28,042 --> 00:55:30,625
That is a dangerous
request you're making...

654
00:55:30,875 --> 00:55:31,956
Though I would like to help you.

655
00:55:32,542 --> 00:55:33,873
Just show us how you do it!

656
00:55:33,958 --> 00:55:36,996
Yeah! If you have his grumpiness,
you must have his talent!

657
00:55:38,125 --> 00:55:41,698
You mean finish his work?
That sounds appealing...

658
00:55:42,417 --> 00:55:43,999
I would need several other colors,

659
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:45,786
like oranges and earth tones...

660
00:55:45,958 --> 00:55:48,370
They should be on the table!
- ...aquamarine, indigo...

661
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:49,706
On top of the piano!

662
00:55:49,792 --> 00:55:51,203
Burnt orange... forest green...

663
00:55:51,917 --> 00:55:52,782
There's more in the drawer!

664
00:56:10,083 --> 00:56:11,665
Wait! You first, Quill!

665
00:56:12,042 --> 00:56:14,830
What? No, I can wait.

666
00:56:15,333 --> 00:56:16,949
First, could you...

667
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:19,823
paint him?

668
00:56:23,958 --> 00:56:27,246
How do you expect me to make
anything out of that mangled, twisted mess?

669
00:56:28,042 --> 00:56:30,124
He's not a mess!
He's my friend!

670
00:56:30,875 --> 00:56:32,491
What was your friend like?

671
00:56:32,917 --> 00:56:36,114
He was... very kind!

672
00:56:37,083 --> 00:56:38,915
How can he paint kindness?

673
00:56:40,083 --> 00:56:41,573
Tell him what he looks like.

674
00:56:49,625 --> 00:56:52,458
He should be short and kind of scrawny,

675
00:56:53,875 --> 00:56:55,582
and he had a bit of a belly.

676
00:56:57,542 --> 00:56:59,078
No, no, not that flabby.

677
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:02,074
Ah, yes, that's much better!

678
00:57:05,917 --> 00:57:08,500
He was sensitive and thoughtful.

679
00:57:08,833 --> 00:57:09,698
A great guy!

680
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,707
What am I doing here?

681
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:17,957
Quill!
- You're back, Gum!

682
00:57:19,083 --> 00:57:20,244
I've missed you!

683
00:58:22,125 --> 00:58:24,036
You're finally back.
Do you have any news?

684
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,081
Are these rumors true'?

685
00:58:25,667 --> 00:58:27,829
The Alldunns are definitely 
up to something!

686
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:31,663
They've rounded up all the Sketchies,
and put them to work building a big platform.

687
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:50,286
How can the Sketchies be so useless?

688
00:58:51,417 --> 00:58:52,953
They must be doing it on purpose!

689
00:59:14,625 --> 00:59:16,115
I see you in there. No use hiding!

690
00:59:17,417 --> 00:59:18,498
We're putting you to work!

691
00:59:18,625 --> 00:59:20,536
Halfies, Sketchies, what's the difference?

692
00:59:20,792 --> 00:59:21,406
Move it!

693
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:23,494
You too!
- I don't care, move it!

694
00:59:23,708 --> 00:59:25,324
Quit dawdling!
We don't have all night!

695
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:54,208
We'll head to the south of the camp,
just under those trees.

696
01:00:34,917 --> 01:00:36,248
Are you coming with us, Magenta?

697
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:39,287
Give me a minute! I have an idea!

698
01:00:39,625 --> 01:00:40,990
Come on, hurry up!

699
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,366
You go ahead. We'll catch
up with you later!

700
01:00:46,292 --> 01:00:47,623
What is that girl up to now?

701
01:02:08,833 --> 01:02:10,915
I'm going ahead
to check things out.

702
01:02:11,583 --> 01:02:14,041
You wait here. And don't do
anything until I get back!

703
01:02:14,458 --> 01:02:15,038
Okay?

704
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:19,661
Hey! Ramo!

705
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,331
Looking for Claire?

706
01:03:21,833 --> 01:03:22,823
What happened here?

707
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:24,494
Where is everybody?

708
01:03:24,917 --> 01:03:25,577
Is she okay?

709
01:03:25,833 --> 01:03:27,289
Come. I'll show you.

710
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:31,830
Understood.

711
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:33,122
You can trust me.

712
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:34,956
And don't leave anyone behind!

713
01:03:38,167 --> 01:03:39,703
Ramo? Is that you?

714
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,287
Darling!
- Where were you?

715
01:03:44,417 --> 01:03:46,499
Far away!
But I'm back now.

716
01:03:47,208 --> 01:03:48,539
Everything will be okay!

717
01:03:50,333 --> 01:03:52,574
No! Ramo! Stop that!

718
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:55,207
You're hurting him!

719
01:03:56,125 --> 01:03:58,617
Leave him alone! Why are you doing this?

720
01:04:29,875 --> 01:04:30,990
How much further?

721
01:04:31,292 --> 01:04:33,624
We're almost there! This way.

722
01:04:34,833 --> 01:04:36,073
He)' everyone!

723
01:04:36,333 --> 01:04:37,949
Is that... Quill and Gum?

724
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:39,160
I don't believe it!

725
01:04:40,083 --> 01:04:40,743
It sure is!

726
01:04:40,958 --> 01:04:42,448
Look!
- It's incredible!

727
01:04:43,542 --> 01:04:46,204
Are you sure that's them?
- How did they do that'?

728
01:04:46,917 --> 01:04:48,407
Step right UP!

729
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,708
We have everything you could
possibly need!

730
01:04:52,917 --> 01:04:54,749
We have colors, we have brushes.

731
01:04:54,875 --> 01:04:57,663
You can paint yourself in
any way you like!

732
01:04:58,333 --> 01:05:00,244
Now you can be pastel if you want.

733
01:05:00,542 --> 01:05:02,704
Or maybe more vivid.
Or maybe both!

734
01:05:02,917 --> 01:05:04,078
Why, look at me!

735
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,662
I bet you can't even recognize me!

736
01:05:06,958 --> 01:05:08,289
He really has changed.

737
01:05:08,417 --> 01:05:10,658
Yes, he has so much more confidence now!
- Have no fear!

738
01:05:11,042 --> 01:05:14,990
Allow me to demonstrate.
You, sir, let me show you how it is done!

739
01:05:17,583 --> 01:05:21,247
A touch of paint...
you fill in the lines like so.

740
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:23,206
There. You see?
It isn't hard.

741
01:05:23,792 --> 01:05:25,624
Yeah, okay, but I didn't want that color!

742
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,287
I think it's nice. Now, who's next'?

743
01:05:28,583 --> 01:05:31,120
I'll take that!
- Suit yourself, I just wanted to...

744
01:05:31,417 --> 01:05:34,079
You said we could paint ourselves!
- Yeah, so go ahead!

745
01:05:45,042 --> 01:05:45,497
Quill!

746
01:05:45,625 --> 01:05:47,832
Oh, dear! Wait... Everyone calm down!

747
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:53,072
I love it!
- But Mom, I want to be blue!

748
01:05:53,375 --> 01:05:55,161
Why isn't there any mauve?

749
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:03,407
Let go of me!

750
01:06:11,542 --> 01:06:12,782
Why won't you listen?

751
01:06:14,083 --> 01:06:15,414
Ah, there you two are, just in time!

752
01:06:16,708 --> 01:06:19,541
Go see for yourselves! They've gone crazy.
- What do we do?

753
01:06:20,083 --> 01:06:22,450
We did our best. 
They're just out of control.

754
01:06:30,542 --> 01:06:31,873
What's all the fuss about?

755
01:06:32,167 --> 01:06:33,032
I haven't a clue!

756
01:06:33,292 --> 01:06:34,748
I can't wait for it to start!

757
01:06:34,917 --> 01:06:36,533
This is rather exciting!

758
01:06:36,958 --> 01:06:38,540
What could the Great Chandelier 
have in store?

759
01:06:38,625 --> 01:06:39,956
He has another surprise?

760
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:41,536
I just love surprises!

761
01:06:42,292 --> 01:06:43,578
There you are!

762
01:06:49,333 --> 01:06:51,791
You look stunning.
- How mysterious!

763
01:06:52,042 --> 01:06:53,703
Truly.
- Thank you!

764
01:06:54,167 --> 01:06:55,999
I hope this is fun!
- I'm over here!

765
01:08:29,708 --> 01:08:30,789
They're so young!

766
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:43,868
As you can see, we have reunited
the two lovebirds!

767
01:08:44,208 --> 01:08:46,290
Don't they make a sweet couple?

768
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,992
That's odd! They don't look happy!

769
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:54,036
Why 80 pale?

770
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,286
We stunned them into silence.

771
01:08:56,917 --> 01:08:59,375
Where are your witty comebacks
now, young man?

772
01:09:00,042 --> 01:09:01,749
Has the Painter returned?

773
01:09:02,167 --> 01:09:03,532
If so, where is he?

774
01:09:03,833 --> 01:09:06,245
And did you manage to speak with him, then?

775
01:09:07,875 --> 01:09:09,957
You were hoping to do
what now, again...?

776
01:09:10,125 --> 01:09:10,830
<i>Oh yes...</i>

777
01:09:11,417 --> 01:09:13,749
Blot out the differences.

778
01:09:15,833 --> 01:09:17,949
Well, why don't we start
with the two of you?

779
01:09:18,583 --> 01:09:20,745
Your wish is about to be granted.

780
01:09:21,417 --> 01:09:23,408
What better way to unite you two,

781
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:24,865
than to blend you...

782
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:26,240
black?

783
01:09:26,708 --> 01:09:28,415
Executioner black!

784
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:54,957
Look at all those colors!

785
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:56,914
Are they Alldunns?

786
01:09:57,083 --> 01:09:58,699
Absolutely splendid!

787
01:09:59,542 --> 01:10:00,748
I want a closer look!

788
01:10:02,042 --> 01:10:04,329
They're like us, but even more colorful!

789
01:10:05,333 --> 01:10:06,368
Where have they come from?

790
01:10:14,083 --> 01:10:16,290
You are forbidden to talk to them!

791
01:10:16,458 --> 01:10:18,074
Hey! Do you hear me'?

792
01:10:18,542 --> 01:10:19,703
I forbid you!

793
01:10:20,167 --> 01:10:22,579
Absolutely magnificent!
- How ever did you do it?

794
01:10:22,667 --> 01:10:25,864
You can simply change yourself if you like!
- Your colors sparkle!

795
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,788
We have everything you need:
hundreds of colors and brushes...

796
01:10:28,875 --> 01:10:31,037
I know! Let's give Chandelier a makeover!

797
01:10:32,542 --> 01:10:35,375
A wonderful idea!
- Someone get me a paintbrush!

798
01:10:58,625 --> 01:11:00,207
Yes, yes, it's true...

799
01:11:00,667 --> 01:11:01,953
There are paintings other than this one!

800
01:11:02,125 --> 01:11:05,789
And not only that. You can jump,
from canvas to canvas with relative ease...

801
01:11:07,333 --> 01:11:08,118
To an extent!

802
01:11:08,583 --> 01:11:10,165
Anyway, there are different shades, too...

803
01:11:10,458 --> 01:11:12,790
Some are more green,
others, more red...

804
01:11:13,333 --> 01:11:14,698
Nothing to get too worked up about.

805
01:11:17,833 --> 01:11:20,370
Well, Lola, what'd you think?

806
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:22,740
Your dress!

807
01:11:23,375 --> 01:11:24,957
You're not going
to stay like that!

808
01:11:26,167 --> 01:11:29,034
There's one painting where
they dance all day long.

809
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:30,456
It's unbelievable!

810
01:11:30,667 --> 01:11:31,623
It's the truth.

811
01:11:31,875 --> 01:11:33,161
I saw it with my own eyes.

812
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:34,365
Ask Lola!

813
01:11:59,542 --> 01:12:00,373
No.

814
01:12:02,625 --> 01:12:03,490
You.

815
01:15:06,458 --> 01:15:08,074
Okay boy, settle down.

816
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:09,581
Don't worry, he won't hurt you.

817
01:15:10,250 --> 01:15:11,957
He's quite blind, you know.

818
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:15,249
But don't I know you from somewhere?

819
01:15:16,625 --> 01:15:18,115
You've left your picture!

820
01:15:18,625 --> 01:15:20,787
Yes. Are you mad at me?

821
01:15:32,125 --> 01:15:33,911
There are others, just like me!

822
01:15:34,375 --> 01:15:36,332
Oh, but don't worry,
they won't bother you.

823
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,332
The Halfies and the Sketchies are pretty
preoccupied.

824
01:15:39,667 --> 01:15:41,078
They found paint, so...

825
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:43,078
They're painting themselves?

826
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:45,412
But what do you know about painting?

827
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:47,240
Your self-portrait taught us.

828
01:15:47,375 --> 01:15:49,958
Oh, no. Seriously?
Is he still causing trouble?

829
01:15:50,625 --> 01:15:53,242
Oh no, I think he went back to sleep.

830
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:59,498
You know, there are some people who really 
believe that you've abandoned them.

831
01:16:00,542 --> 01:16:01,703
Are you sure?

832
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:04,414
Why would think think something like that?

833
01:16:05,875 --> 01:16:07,331
I haven't abandoned anyone!

834
01:16:08,792 --> 01:16:10,624
I gave them all the basics for living.

835
01:16:11,417 --> 01:16:13,784
A simple design
is often more beautiful

836
01:16:13,875 --> 01:16:15,206
than a fully-polished painting!

837
01:16:18,167 --> 01:16:20,659
So, if they decide 
to complete themselves...

838
01:16:21,333 --> 01:16:22,869
Well then, that's just fine!

839
01:16:24,458 --> 01:16:25,869
I think it's good!

840
01:16:27,208 --> 01:16:28,243
But you...

841
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:30,241
You seem to be different from the others.

842
01:16:31,458 --> 01:16:33,916
Tell me... what are you looking for?

843
01:16:34,458 --> 01:16:35,493
So you still paint?

844
01:16:36,042 --> 01:16:37,999
Yes, but only landscapes now.

845
01:16:38,542 --> 01:16:40,158
It's less stressful.

846
01:16:41,458 --> 01:16:43,119
Now what do you think of this one?

847
01:16:43,875 --> 01:16:44,956
I like it.

848
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:47,662
The clouds, they look like
they're dancing!

849
01:16:52,917 --> 01:16:54,874
Would you mind if I took a walk around?

850
01:16:55,333 --> 01:16:56,744
Go wherever you'd like.

851
01:16:57,250 --> 01:16:58,866
There are no fences here.

852
01:17:00,542 --> 01:17:02,579
You can even walk down to the sea.

853
01:17:02,958 --> 01:17:05,871
It's over there, just beyond the dunes...

854
01:17:12,583 --> 01:17:14,039
You never answered me!

855
01:17:15,125 --> 01:17:16,581
What did you come here for?

856
01:17:16,583 --> 01:17:19,655
Oh, nothing. I just wanted
to meet you!

857
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:21,536
And now...

858
01:17:22,208 --> 01:17:23,949
And now, what?

859
01:17:25,167 --> 01:17:27,750
Now I'd like to know who painted you!
