1
00:04:03,748 --> 00:04:05,875
Derek.

2
00:04:11,464 --> 00:04:13,425
What the fuck are you thinking?

3
00:04:13,466 --> 00:04:16,428
There's a black guy outside
breaking into your car.

4
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:18,805
How long's he been there?

5
00:04:18,805 --> 00:04:20,223
I don't know.

6
00:04:20,265 --> 00:04:21,558
What's going on?

7
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:23,977
Not right now, honey. How many?

8
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:25,312
Danny, how many?

9
00:04:25,353 --> 00:04:26,604
One, I think.

10
00:04:26,646 --> 00:04:28,648
Is he strapped?

11
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,066
Does he have a gun?

12
00:04:30,108 --> 00:04:31,776
I don't fucking know.

13
00:04:33,528 --> 00:04:35,947
Wait a second.
What the fuck is going on?

14
00:04:35,989 --> 00:04:38,325
Stay right here and be quiet.

15
00:04:38,366 --> 00:04:40,869
Wait a second, Derek. Wait.

16
00:04:46,082 --> 00:04:47,375
Stay right here.

17
00:06:29,102 --> 00:06:31,062
I don't have a personal problem
with him.

18
00:06:31,104 --> 00:06:33,231
Don't insult
my intelligence, Murray.

19
00:06:33,273 --> 00:06:36,318
You hate this child,
and I think I know why.

20
00:06:42,198 --> 00:06:44,242
Dr. Sweeney's office.

21
00:06:44,284 --> 00:06:46,536
I went out with his mother
a few times.

22
00:06:46,578 --> 00:06:48,747
That was three years ago.
It was nothing.

23
00:06:48,788 --> 00:06:50,290
Nothing. Really?

24
00:06:50,332 --> 00:06:53,543
That paper--
Bob, it's a travesty.

25
00:06:53,585 --> 00:06:56,671
Arguing for Hitler
as a civil rights hero.

26
00:06:56,713 --> 00:06:58,131
You've got to draw the line.

27
00:07:02,052 --> 00:07:04,971
on any book that related to
the struggle for civil rights...

28
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:06,473
in plain English.

29
00:07:06,473 --> 00:07:10,310
I am not disputing the fact
that the child is confused...

30
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,312
and harbors some sick ideas...

31
00:07:12,312 --> 00:07:15,065
but I am not ready
to give up on him yet.

32
00:07:15,106 --> 00:07:17,817
His brother probably
put him up to it.

33
00:07:17,859 --> 00:07:20,195
I guarantee you 100%%...

34
00:07:20,236 --> 00:07:22,405
his brother did not
put him up to this.

35
00:07:22,447 --> 00:07:24,491
I find that hard to believe.

36
00:07:24,532 --> 00:07:26,242
I know he was a good kid...

37
00:07:26,284 --> 00:07:28,995
and it's a shame what he's been
through, but that's dangerous.

38
00:07:29,037 --> 00:07:30,830
Dangerous in what way?

39
00:07:30,872 --> 00:07:32,666
That goes too far.

40
00:07:32,707 --> 00:07:36,544
This racist propaganda,
"Mein Kampf" psychobabble...

41
00:07:36,586 --> 00:07:39,881
he learned this nonsense,
and he can unlearn it, too.

42
00:07:39,923 --> 00:07:42,717
I will not give up
on this child yet.

43
00:08:00,276 --> 00:08:01,611
I knew it was you.

44
00:08:01,653 --> 00:08:03,697
Danny, get in here.

45
00:08:03,738 --> 00:08:05,991
I said get in here!

46
00:08:06,032 --> 00:08:07,367
Get in here!

47
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:10,328
Five, four, three, two...

48
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,247
Shut the door!

49
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,668
What's it gonna be, Danny?

50
00:08:17,794 --> 00:08:19,337
What's what gonna be?

51
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:21,548
This petty crap you're pulling.

52
00:08:23,925 --> 00:08:25,176
I don't know.

53
00:08:25,218 --> 00:08:26,720
Have a seat.

54
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,060
How are you doing?

55
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,981
Fine.

56
00:08:39,232 --> 00:08:40,984
Things at home OK?

57
00:08:46,072 --> 00:08:48,700
Derek got out this morning,
did he not?

58
00:08:50,869 --> 00:08:52,746
Yeah, he did.

59
00:08:52,746 --> 00:08:55,749
He was one of my students.
You knew that, right?

60
00:08:55,749 --> 00:08:57,584
Honors English.

61
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:01,421
He was a brilliant student
like you...

62
00:09:01,421 --> 00:09:07,010
but he hung out with fools,
also like you.

63
00:09:07,052 --> 00:09:09,179
Did you bring me in here
to talk about Derek?

64
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,723
What happened to him
has nothing to do with me.

65
00:09:11,765 --> 00:09:15,852
Everything you do right now
has something to do with Derek.

66
00:09:15,894 --> 00:09:18,104
I followed directions.
I wrote an "A" Paper.

67
00:09:18,146 --> 00:09:20,690
"Mein Kampf"?

68
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:23,693
I should expel you.

69
00:09:23,735 --> 00:09:26,404
Go ahead. You don't
think I could handle it?

70
00:09:26,446 --> 00:09:28,657
No. I think the street
would kill you.

71
00:09:28,698 --> 00:09:30,742
Your rhetoric
and your propaganda...

72
00:09:30,784 --> 00:09:32,911
aren't going to save you
out there.

73
00:09:34,287 --> 00:09:35,622
So here's the drill.

74
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm your history teacher
from now on.

75
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:42,754
We will discuss current events.

76
00:09:42,796 --> 00:09:46,091
We will call this class...

77
00:09:46,132 --> 00:09:49,260
American History X.

78
00:09:49,302 --> 00:09:52,263
We meet once a day.

79
00:09:52,305 --> 00:09:54,641
All right.
Your first assignment...

80
00:09:54,641 --> 00:09:57,143
is to prepare for me
a new paper due tomorrow.

81
00:09:57,143 --> 00:10:00,855
Come on, Sweeney. It took me
a week to read "Mein Kampf."

82
00:10:10,907 --> 00:10:12,742
What do you want me to do it on?

83
00:10:12,784 --> 00:10:15,161
Your brother.

84
00:10:15,161 --> 00:10:17,288
Oh, God, man.
Please tell me you're joking.

85
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,708
No. I'm not kidding.

86
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:23,294
I want you to analyze
and interpret all the events...

87
00:10:23,336 --> 00:10:25,130
surrounding
Derek's incarceration.

88
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:28,925
How these events helped shape
your present perspective...

89
00:10:28,967 --> 00:10:32,178
concerning life
in contemporary America.

90
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,057
The impact on your life,
your family's.

91
00:10:38,685 --> 00:10:41,187
Whatever you want to say, Danny.

92
00:10:43,773 --> 00:10:46,776
I'll be the only one reading it.

93
00:10:47,944 --> 00:10:53,074
But if it's not on my desk
tomorrow morning...

94
00:10:53,116 --> 00:10:56,494
you are a ghost
at Venice Beach High.

95
00:10:57,871 --> 00:10:59,164
You clear?

96
00:11:00,165 --> 00:11:02,208
Yeah, I'm clear.

97
00:11:07,672 --> 00:11:09,174
Telling teacher
I'm fuckin' cheatin'!

98
00:11:09,215 --> 00:11:10,842
Is that what's happening?

99
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,678
I never cheated in my life.

100
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,221
Beat his mo'fuckin' ass.

101
00:11:15,263 --> 00:11:16,514
I didn't say anything!

102
00:11:16,556 --> 00:11:17,849
Why you trippin' on me?

103
00:11:20,268 --> 00:11:23,480
Now why you all kicking it
like that?

104
00:11:23,521 --> 00:11:25,398
What's up, man?

105
00:11:25,398 --> 00:11:28,360
What you scared for?
I ain't gonna do nothing.

106
00:11:35,575 --> 00:11:37,452
What's up?

107
00:11:37,494 --> 00:11:41,164
Want some, too, bitch?
Punk, what's wrong with you?

108
00:11:41,206 --> 00:11:42,624
You want to die?

109
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:46,002
Punk-ass white boy.

110
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:56,721
You lucky I gotta go to class.
He ain't gonna do nothing.

111
00:11:56,763 --> 00:11:59,641
He don't wanna see me
and the heater.

112
00:12:01,393 --> 00:12:02,644
Lucky the bell rung.

113
00:12:02,686 --> 00:12:04,562
I would have clocked
that white boy.

114
00:12:04,604 --> 00:12:07,399
Punk-ass motherfucker.
Should smoke that fool.

115
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:10,902
You gotta fucking stand up
for yourself.

116
00:12:26,584 --> 00:12:28,670
We got a whole file
on skinheads here.

117
00:12:28,712 --> 00:12:30,171
Part of the same gang?

118
00:12:30,213 --> 00:12:31,381
Venice Beach gang.

119
00:12:31,423 --> 00:12:34,884
Actually,
he's done a stretch at Y.A.

120
00:12:34,926 --> 00:12:37,804
This guy C.C., is that him?

121
00:12:37,846 --> 00:12:39,889
Yeah, that's him right there.

122
00:12:41,474 --> 00:12:43,977
This morning we have a guest,
and there he is.

123
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:45,186
Good morning.

124
00:12:45,228 --> 00:12:46,396
Morning, sir.

125
00:12:46,438 --> 00:12:47,772
Good to see you.

126
00:12:47,814 --> 00:12:48,982
Good morning.

127
00:12:49,024 --> 00:12:51,067
This here is Dr. Bob Sweeney.

128
00:12:51,109 --> 00:12:53,570
He's principal
over at Venice Beach High.

129
00:12:53,611 --> 00:12:56,031
For some time now,
he's been doing outreach work...

130
00:12:56,072 --> 00:12:58,491
with gangs
both in and out of the can.

131
00:12:58,533 --> 00:13:01,453
Three years ago, a local kid
named Derek Vinyard...

132
00:13:01,494 --> 00:13:03,580
was sent up for murdering
a couple of Crips...

133
00:13:03,621 --> 00:13:05,790
who were trying to jack his car.

134
00:13:05,832 --> 00:13:09,461
Bob taught Vinyard, and
he's followed this case closely.

135
00:13:09,502 --> 00:13:11,838
He was a skinhead, right?

136
00:13:11,838 --> 00:13:14,382
He was more
like "the" skinhead...

137
00:13:14,424 --> 00:13:16,593
the protégé
of Cameron Alexander.

138
00:13:16,635 --> 00:13:19,220
-Who?
-Cameron Alexander.

139
00:13:19,262 --> 00:13:22,265
Here you go. Have a look-see.

140
00:13:22,307 --> 00:13:26,061
Cameron Alexander, well,
he's a Venice Beach landmark.

141
00:13:26,102 --> 00:13:27,896
He's the biggest distributor
and writer...

142
00:13:27,937 --> 00:13:30,398
of White Power literature
and videos in L.A. County.

143
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,526
He promotes White Power bands,
he writes reviews...

144
00:13:33,568 --> 00:13:36,655
and in his spare time, this guy
even writes hate columns.

145
00:13:36,696 --> 00:13:39,491
-Does he have a record?
-He's pretty clean.

146
00:13:39,532 --> 00:13:42,160
Been trying to pin something
to him, but it doesn't work.

147
00:13:42,202 --> 00:13:44,829
Trust me.
He's behind all of it.

148
00:13:44,871 --> 00:13:47,624
He runs everything
out of his house by the beach.

149
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,293
There were no white gangs
in Venice Beach...

150
00:13:50,335 --> 00:13:52,587
before Cameron Alexander
and Derek Vinyard hooked up.

151
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:55,548
Alexander found in Derek
his shining prince.

152
00:13:55,548 --> 00:13:58,468
Essentially,
he used Derek to recruit...

153
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,472
a slew of insecure, frustrated,
and impressionable kids.

154
00:14:02,514 --> 00:14:05,600
This kid Vinyard,
he's got a lot of baggage...

155
00:14:05,642 --> 00:14:09,604
as you'll see on this tape
we've gotten courtesy of NBC.

156
00:14:16,236 --> 00:14:18,738
Earlier today, L.A. County
firefighter Dennis Vinyard...

157
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,408
was shot and killed
battling a blaze...

158
00:14:21,449 --> 00:14:23,326
at a suspected Compton drug den.

159
00:14:23,368 --> 00:14:25,203
We're at the Vinyard home now...

160
00:14:25,245 --> 00:14:27,163
and Lieutenant Vinyard's
oldest son Derek...

161
00:14:27,205 --> 00:14:29,290
has agreed to talk with us
for a moment.

162
00:14:29,332 --> 00:14:32,711
Derek, if you could come
down here please for a second.

163
00:14:32,752 --> 00:14:37,757
Look, I know this is tough,
but how do you feel right now?

164
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:40,260
How do you think I feel?

165
00:14:40,302 --> 00:14:43,263
-I think it's typical.
-Typical how?

166
00:14:43,263 --> 00:14:46,891
Well, this country's becoming
a haven for criminals...

167
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:48,393
so what do you expect?

168
00:14:48,435 --> 00:14:50,603
Decent hard-working Americans
like my dad...

169
00:14:50,645 --> 00:14:53,648
are getting rubbed out
by social parasites.

170
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,025
Parasites?

171
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:59,279
Blacks, browns, yellow,
whatever.

172
00:14:59,321 --> 00:15:00,864
I don't understand.

173
00:15:00,905 --> 00:15:02,907
You think maybe your father's
murder was race-related?

174
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:04,868
Yeah, it's race-related.

175
00:15:04,909 --> 00:15:06,786
Every problem in this country
is race-related.

176
00:15:06,828 --> 00:15:10,623
Not just crime.
It's immigration, AIDS, welfare.

177
00:15:10,623 --> 00:15:12,834
Those are problems
of the black community...

178
00:15:12,876 --> 00:15:14,669
the Hispanic community,
the Asian community.

179
00:15:14,711 --> 00:15:16,087
They're not white problems.

180
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:18,548
Aren't those really issues
that deal more with poverty?

181
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:22,427
No. They're not products
of their environments.

182
00:15:22,469 --> 00:15:24,304
Minorities don't give two shits
about this country.

183
00:15:24,346 --> 00:15:27,641
They come here to exploit it,
not to embrace it.

184
00:15:27,641 --> 00:15:30,352
Millions of white Europeans
came here and flourished...

185
00:15:30,393 --> 00:15:31,770
within a generation.

186
00:15:31,811 --> 00:15:34,189
What the fuck is the matter
with these people?

187
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,274
They have to go around
shooting at firemen.

188
00:15:36,316 --> 00:15:39,277
What does this have to do
with the murder of your father?

189
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:41,738
Because my father was murdered
doing his job!

190
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,157
Putting out a fire in a fucking
nigger neighborhood...

191
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:45,992
he shouldn't
have given a shit about.

192
00:15:46,034 --> 00:15:48,244
He got shot
by a fucking drug dealer...

193
00:15:48,286 --> 00:15:50,747
who probably still collects
a welfare check.

194
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:53,708
Derek Vinyard was quietly
released from Chino...

195
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,045
early this morning after serving
three and some odd years.

196
00:15:57,087 --> 00:15:59,839
I think this is something
we gotta keep an eye on.

197
00:15:59,881 --> 00:16:01,466
If something happens to him...

198
00:16:01,508 --> 00:16:04,469
things could get very ugly
down by the beach.

199
00:16:04,511 --> 00:16:05,845
Just keep it low.

200
00:16:07,138 --> 00:16:10,266
Venice Beach
didn't always look like this.

201
00:16:10,308 --> 00:16:12,852
It used to be
a great neighborhood.

202
00:16:12,894 --> 00:16:14,896
The boardwalk's always
been a dump...

203
00:16:14,938 --> 00:16:17,107
but when my dad moved us
out here...

204
00:16:17,148 --> 00:16:19,567
Venice was a nice,
quiet place to grow up.

205
00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:24,197
Over the years, though,
it's just gone to hell.

206
00:16:24,239 --> 00:16:26,199
The gangs are like a plague.

207
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:29,536
They moved west from Inglewood
and South Central...

208
00:16:29,577 --> 00:16:30,954
and basically took over.

209
00:16:30,996 --> 00:16:32,372
I ain't foulin' you!

210
00:16:39,546 --> 00:16:42,007
I ain't got time
for all this bullshit.

211
00:16:42,048 --> 00:16:43,425
Fuck y'all.

212
00:16:43,466 --> 00:16:44,592
You all right?

213
00:16:44,634 --> 00:16:45,802
I'm all right.

214
00:16:47,345 --> 00:16:50,307
Yo, is that that fool
you was telling me about?

215
00:16:51,391 --> 00:16:53,310
Yeah, that's that motherfucker.

216
00:16:58,732 --> 00:17:00,942
Yeah, man, that's him.

217
00:17:10,201 --> 00:17:12,037
Bitch-ass motherfucker.

218
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:14,205
That's why Derek started
the D.O.C.

219
00:17:14,247 --> 00:17:17,375
He said white kids shouldn't
have to walk around scared...

220
00:17:17,417 --> 00:17:19,878
in their own neighborhood,
and for a while there...

221
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,756
we really made it
like it was ours again.

222
00:17:22,797 --> 00:17:25,383
Throw the ball!

223
00:17:25,425 --> 00:17:27,052
Come on, Curtis!

224
00:17:27,093 --> 00:17:29,012
Quit chucking it up.
Pass the ball.

225
00:17:30,972 --> 00:17:32,724
"D" up!

226
00:17:32,766 --> 00:17:34,100
Come on, let's go.

227
00:17:34,934 --> 00:17:36,686
Look at this
fucking jungle bunny.

228
00:17:36,728 --> 00:17:39,522
He does a spin move every time.

229
00:17:40,774 --> 00:17:42,942
You ain't gettin' shit,
motherfucker.

230
00:17:44,569 --> 00:17:46,738
This one's for you, boy!

231
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,989
What the fuck you--

232
00:17:49,282 --> 00:17:50,867
Who you callin' boy,
motherfucker?

233
00:17:50,909 --> 00:17:52,118
You're lucky, motherfucker!

234
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,287
I'm through monkeying around
with your fucking ass!

235
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:56,956
Pale, pasty, pastrami-eating,
cracker motherfucker.

236
00:17:56,998 --> 00:17:59,084
A hundred bucks
say I make you my bitch.

237
00:18:01,586 --> 00:18:04,089
Hear that?
He's trying to make ends meet...

238
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,049
for his cut in welfare.
You're on!

239
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:09,094
It's eight-six, Seth.

240
00:18:09,135 --> 00:18:11,304
When I want your opinion,
I'll ask for it.

241
00:18:11,346 --> 00:18:13,932
Come on. I can't cover this.
Help me out here.

242
00:18:13,974 --> 00:18:15,308
You got a big fucking mouth.

243
00:18:15,308 --> 00:18:17,435
I can take this niglet down.

244
00:18:17,477 --> 00:18:19,980
You couldn't take a shit.
What are you thinking?

245
00:18:20,021 --> 00:18:21,564
I will beat him.
Give me the money.

246
00:18:21,606 --> 00:18:22,774
Shut up.

247
00:18:22,816 --> 00:18:24,651
You're gonna
fucking embarrass us.

248
00:18:32,784 --> 00:18:34,828
I'll take care of this.

249
00:18:34,869 --> 00:18:36,830
Yo, I ain't got time for this.

250
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:37,998
Hey!

251
00:18:39,207 --> 00:18:40,500
I got a bet.

252
00:18:41,668 --> 00:18:44,629
I come in this game right now.
Same score...

253
00:18:44,671 --> 00:18:47,173
but we play black guys
against the white guys.

254
00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:54,514
Name your price, cracker.

255
00:18:54,556 --> 00:18:56,933
No money. For these courts.

256
00:18:56,975 --> 00:18:58,852
And not just today. For good.

257
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:00,979
If you win,
we will walk away...

258
00:19:01,021 --> 00:19:04,899
but if we win,
no bitching, no fighting.

259
00:19:04,941 --> 00:19:07,944
Right here in front of
everybody, pack up your shit...

260
00:19:07,986 --> 00:19:09,988
and get your black asses
out of here.

261
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,698
Fuck that. Take this bet.

262
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,241
Eight to six. Our ball.

263
00:19:13,283 --> 00:19:14,993
Let's go.

264
00:19:30,383 --> 00:19:31,843
Pick him up!

265
00:19:38,892 --> 00:19:40,935
Seth,
get back and play some "D."

266
00:19:57,077 --> 00:19:58,244
Defense!

267
00:20:06,378 --> 00:20:08,672
Pass the fucking ball!
I was wide open!

268
00:20:24,104 --> 00:20:25,438
Bullshit.
That's fuckin' offence.

269
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,232
Get out of here.
He moved his feet.

270
00:20:27,273 --> 00:20:30,276
You want to go, I'm ready!
Don't throw elbows at me!

271
00:20:30,318 --> 00:20:32,696
You want to go, Adolf Hitler
wannabe motherfucker?

272
00:20:43,999 --> 00:20:46,626
-You OK?
-Yeah. Give me some water.

273
00:20:46,668 --> 00:20:48,753
You gotta call offence
on that shit.

274
00:20:48,795 --> 00:20:50,588
Not on game point, Danny.

275
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,799
You can't let those niggers
get away with that shit.

276
00:20:52,841 --> 00:20:54,009
It's game point.

277
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,760
Shut 'em down. Kick some ass.

278
00:20:55,802 --> 00:20:58,138
Watch this.

279
00:21:51,691 --> 00:21:52,984
Bye-bye.

280
00:21:53,026 --> 00:21:54,861
Get the fuck off my court!

281
00:21:54,903 --> 00:21:56,154
This is my house!

282
00:21:56,196 --> 00:21:57,530
Fuck you, bitch!

283
00:22:09,542 --> 00:22:11,503
Get the fuck out of here!

284
00:22:11,544 --> 00:22:13,046
This is my court!

285
00:22:23,306 --> 00:22:26,017
Derek wouldn't let us visit him
in prison.

286
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:28,770
He said it would make it
just too hard for him...

287
00:22:28,812 --> 00:22:31,856
and that if we came,
he wouldn't see us anyhow.

288
00:22:31,898 --> 00:22:34,693
Three years without him,
just wondering.

289
00:22:37,278 --> 00:22:39,864
And then at 7:00 this morning...

290
00:22:39,906 --> 00:22:42,534
we picked him up
outside the gate.

291
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:51,793
The whole ride back,
he didn't say anything.

292
00:22:51,835 --> 00:22:53,336
I wanted to stay home,
but he said...

293
00:22:53,378 --> 00:22:55,046
"No. Go to school.
I'll see you later."

294
00:23:09,561 --> 00:23:12,439
Oh, come on.
Give the guy a break.

295
00:23:12,439 --> 00:23:15,358
What? You too big
to give me a hug, tough guy?

296
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,444
No, man. I just know
you're gonna need someone...

297
00:23:17,485 --> 00:23:19,362
to look after you while
you adjust to all this space.

298
00:23:19,404 --> 00:23:20,613
Yeah, right.

299
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,409
This place is smaller
than the old living room.

300
00:23:24,451 --> 00:23:26,119
How you doing? How's school?

301
00:23:26,161 --> 00:23:27,746
It's good.

302
00:23:27,787 --> 00:23:29,789
You gotta do something
about that hair.

303
00:23:29,831 --> 00:23:31,291
That do's gotta go.

304
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:33,918
-The girls like it.
-Well, I don't.

305
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,380
You're keeping it pretty close.
You took it all the way down.

306
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,383
Shit. Look. I forgot, man.

307
00:23:41,635 --> 00:23:43,887
It hurt like shit
when they put it on.

308
00:23:43,928 --> 00:23:45,847
When'd you get that?

309
00:23:45,889 --> 00:23:48,099
I got it about a month ago.

310
00:23:48,141 --> 00:23:49,851
Cameron made it official.

311
00:23:53,813 --> 00:23:55,523
He put this on you?

312
00:24:01,529 --> 00:24:02,656
What?

313
00:24:02,697 --> 00:24:05,158
Oh, hi. He's here.

314
00:24:05,158 --> 00:24:06,826
Derek, it's for you.

315
00:24:06,868 --> 00:24:09,245
Nothing.

316
00:24:09,287 --> 00:24:12,123
Is there a phone in the back?
I'll get it in the back.

317
00:24:20,215 --> 00:24:23,259
I got it. Yeah?

318
00:24:23,301 --> 00:24:24,427
Oh, hey.

319
00:24:27,055 --> 00:24:28,598
What?

320
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,142
My eyes have seen the glory...

321
00:24:31,184 --> 00:24:33,228
of the trampling at the zoo.

322
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:36,272
We've washed ourselves
in nigger's blood...

323
00:24:36,314 --> 00:24:38,817
and all the mongrels, too.

324
00:24:38,858 --> 00:24:41,569
We're taking down
the Zog machine...

325
00:24:41,611 --> 00:24:43,697
Jew by Jew by Jew.

326
00:24:43,738 --> 00:24:47,701
The white man marches on.

327
00:24:47,701 --> 00:24:50,704
You think our friend
was behind that?

328
00:24:52,205 --> 00:24:53,748
I don't even care.

329
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,959
I'm gonna take care
of that tonight.

330
00:24:56,001 --> 00:25:00,046
My sweet kids. My baby boy.

331
00:25:00,088 --> 00:25:02,966
God, what's with
the love fest, you guys?

332
00:25:08,054 --> 00:25:11,516
No. He'll do it.
I'll make sure he does it.

333
00:25:11,558 --> 00:25:13,184
I'll get it.

334
00:25:20,066 --> 00:25:21,735
I came to see the man.

335
00:25:21,776 --> 00:25:25,071
-Can you fit through the door?
-Fuck you!

336
00:25:27,032 --> 00:25:29,534
What's up, Dan? How you doing?

337
00:25:29,576 --> 00:25:32,078
-Where's Derek?
-He's on the phone.

338
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,498
Come out, you free motherfucker!
Where the fuck are you?

339
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,835
Hang on. Give me a minute.

340
00:25:39,961 --> 00:25:41,921
I'll be out in a minute.

341
00:25:56,478 --> 00:25:57,854
I'll be careful.

342
00:25:57,896 --> 00:26:01,650
I'm not gonna stay
in my room the rest of my life.

343
00:26:01,691 --> 00:26:03,485
Hold on.

344
00:26:03,526 --> 00:26:06,946
Hey. What the fuck
is Seth doing here?

345
00:26:06,988 --> 00:26:08,823
Did you invite him over?

346
00:26:08,865 --> 00:26:11,034
No. He always comes over here.

347
00:26:12,661 --> 00:26:15,080
Danny, give me a minute.

348
00:26:15,121 --> 00:26:17,290
Just give me one minute.

349
00:26:36,977 --> 00:26:38,979
Are you still here, Goodyear?

350
00:26:40,397 --> 00:26:43,316
You calling me a blimp,
you fucking Democrat?

351
00:26:44,484 --> 00:26:47,821
When was the last time you were
actually able to see your feet?

352
00:26:50,532 --> 00:26:52,117
Come in here, Danny.

353
00:26:56,955 --> 00:26:59,332
Are you going to Cam's party
tonight?

354
00:26:59,332 --> 00:27:01,668
Is Davina's ass watertight?

355
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,586
You're fucking sick, man.

356
00:27:03,628 --> 00:27:06,631
All right, relax.
Let me ask you a few questions.

357
00:27:06,673 --> 00:27:08,925
I'm not in the mood.
I got homework.

358
00:27:08,967 --> 00:27:11,803
Tell me some of the shit
you've learned, fuckass...

359
00:27:11,845 --> 00:27:13,471
before I pistol-whip you.

360
00:27:13,513 --> 00:27:16,599
OK. I believe in death,
destruction...

361
00:27:16,641 --> 00:27:18,810
chaos, filth, and greed.

362
00:27:18,852 --> 00:27:22,605
Cut the shit, Dan. Come on.
Tell me what I want to hear.

363
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:25,650
You mean that shit
about your mother?

364
00:27:25,692 --> 00:27:28,528
You want to get
fucking beaten, Danny?

365
00:27:30,196 --> 00:27:33,658
I'm not fucking talking to you.
Shut up.

366
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,411
Look, you gotta let me do this
my own way, all right?

367
00:27:38,163 --> 00:27:39,831
I'll take care of it.

368
00:27:39,873 --> 00:27:41,833
Who do you hate, Danny?

369
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:45,003
I hate anyone
that isn't white Protestant.

370
00:27:45,045 --> 00:27:46,004
Why?

371
00:27:46,046 --> 00:27:48,673
They're a burden to the
advancement of the white race.

372
00:27:48,715 --> 00:27:50,008
Some are all right.

373
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:52,385
None of them
are fucking all right, OK?

374
00:27:52,385 --> 00:27:55,639
They're all a bunch
of fucking freeloaders.

375
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,058
We don't know 'em.
We don't want to know 'em.

376
00:27:58,058 --> 00:27:59,309
They're the fucking enemy.

377
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,521
What don't you like
about them...

378
00:28:03,563 --> 00:28:05,482
and say it with
some fucking conviction.

379
00:28:05,523 --> 00:28:08,735
I hate the fact it's cool
to be black these days.

380
00:28:08,777 --> 00:28:09,903
Good.

381
00:28:09,944 --> 00:28:14,032
I hate this hip-hop influence
on white fucking suburbia.

382
00:28:14,074 --> 00:28:15,617
Good.

383
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:19,788
I hate Tabitha Soren and
her Zionist MTV fucking pigs...

384
00:28:19,829 --> 00:28:21,414
telling us we should get along.

385
00:28:21,456 --> 00:28:24,584
Save the rhetorical bullshit,
Hillary Rodham Clinton...

386
00:28:24,626 --> 00:28:26,378
'cause it ain't gonna
fucking happen.

387
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:28,546
That's some of the best shit
I've ever heard.

388
00:28:28,588 --> 00:28:32,217
I feel sorry for you, Danny.

389
00:28:32,258 --> 00:28:34,386
You don't believe
any of that shit, right?

390
00:28:34,427 --> 00:28:35,553
Shut up.

391
00:28:35,595 --> 00:28:39,182
No. Get out of the house now,
you piece of shit.

392
00:28:39,224 --> 00:28:41,935
Is that any way to talk
to a guest, a friend?

393
00:28:41,977 --> 00:28:44,145
Derek hates you,
and you don't realize it.

394
00:28:44,187 --> 00:28:46,731
How do you know who I hate?

395
00:28:46,773 --> 00:28:50,110
Back from the dead.
God bless Jesus Christ.

396
00:28:50,151 --> 00:28:52,570
God, I think you lost weight.

397
00:28:52,612 --> 00:28:54,781
I can get my arms almost
all the way around you.

398
00:28:54,823 --> 00:28:58,910
Fifty fuckin' pounds, man.
Look at this hair. Holy shit.

399
00:28:58,952 --> 00:29:02,080
I told him it's gotta go.

400
00:29:02,122 --> 00:29:04,249
Grab your jacket.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

401
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:08,420
I want to talk to him.
One second.

402
00:29:08,461 --> 00:29:13,383
Hey, listen. Did you pull
some shit in school today?

403
00:29:13,425 --> 00:29:16,594
-Just the usual.
-This kid is awesome as hell.

404
00:29:16,636 --> 00:29:19,556
Did you turn in a paper
on "Mein Kampf"?

405
00:29:20,849 --> 00:29:24,102
-Sweeney shit his pants.
-He did, man.

406
00:29:24,144 --> 00:29:27,188
Was that your idea or
did Cameron put you up to that?

407
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:30,066
No. I thought it would be cool.
How'd you know?

408
00:29:30,108 --> 00:29:32,277
It doesn't matter how I knew.

409
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:34,612
This kid is smart as hell.

410
00:29:34,654 --> 00:29:36,656
Was that Sweeney on the phone?

411
00:29:36,698 --> 00:29:38,575
Sweeney called and told me.

412
00:29:38,616 --> 00:29:41,619
God, I hate
that fucking nigger, man.

413
00:29:41,661 --> 00:29:43,121
He's gotta get a fucking life.

414
00:29:44,372 --> 00:29:46,082
Sweeney's a good teacher.

415
00:29:46,124 --> 00:29:48,293
Sweeney is a nigger
on a power trip.

416
00:29:48,335 --> 00:29:50,378
That's what he was like
when we were there...

417
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,922
and that's how he is now.
It'll never change.

418
00:29:52,964 --> 00:29:54,132
Fuck that nigger!

419
00:29:54,174 --> 00:29:56,259
-Seth, go away.
-Are you kidding?

420
00:29:56,301 --> 00:29:59,638
Nope. Wait in Danny's room.
I want to talk to my brother.

421
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,515
I've been here 15 minutes.
I'm starving.

422
00:30:06,728 --> 00:30:10,607
Come here. Seriously, look.
Forget this yahoo.

423
00:30:10,649 --> 00:30:13,568
He kills bugs for a living.
You don't want to be like that.

424
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:15,153
I'm serious. It's not funny.

425
00:30:15,195 --> 00:30:17,530
Sweeney is a good teacher.
You can learn a lot from him.

426
00:30:17,572 --> 00:30:20,784
Don't go fuck it up
with small fry shit like that.

427
00:30:20,825 --> 00:30:22,202
You don't understand.

428
00:30:22,202 --> 00:30:24,329
You got to see the bullshit
paper he's making me write.

429
00:30:24,371 --> 00:30:26,915
He told me all about it.
I don't care.

430
00:30:26,957 --> 00:30:29,668
You do anything he tells you
to do. I mean it.

431
00:30:29,709 --> 00:30:31,795
I don't want you getting
in trouble in school...

432
00:30:31,836 --> 00:30:35,215
trying to impress me,
taking this shit in there.

433
00:30:35,215 --> 00:30:37,008
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

434
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:40,762
Yeah, I guess, but, I mean,
I thought you'd be happy.

435
00:30:40,804 --> 00:30:42,222
Well, I'm not.

436
00:30:44,724 --> 00:30:46,059
Listen to that.

437
00:30:46,935 --> 00:30:50,021
Yeah, I know.
It's been getting worse.

438
00:30:50,063 --> 00:30:51,439
Don't worry about it.

439
00:30:51,481 --> 00:30:53,400
I'll talk to you
about this later.

440
00:30:56,403 --> 00:30:58,279
She's coughing her lungs out...

441
00:30:58,321 --> 00:31:00,949
and you're blowing this
in her face all day.

442
00:31:00,991 --> 00:31:02,200
I'm putting it out.

443
00:31:02,242 --> 00:31:05,704
Hey, come on.
I want to talk to you.

444
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:13,086
Mommy, are you OK?

445
00:31:18,925 --> 00:31:20,635
Put that out.

446
00:31:20,677 --> 00:31:23,888
I was just yelling at him
for blowing smoke in your face.

447
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:26,141
Nice thing to come home to, huh?

448
00:31:28,685 --> 00:31:29,978
You all right?

449
00:31:30,979 --> 00:31:32,188
You all right?

450
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,822
Look, you got to take it easy.

451
00:31:40,864 --> 00:31:42,782
You got to get some rest.

452
00:31:42,782 --> 00:31:44,909
Take Danny's and my room,
and we'll hit the couch.

453
00:31:44,951 --> 00:31:47,871
I've been on the couch for ages.
The couch is fine.

454
00:31:47,912 --> 00:31:49,789
No, it's not fine.
This is terrible.

455
00:31:49,789 --> 00:31:53,585
We can't live like this.
We gotta get out of here.

456
00:31:55,712 --> 00:31:57,881
Can I go with you?

457
00:31:57,922 --> 00:32:01,217
Yeah.
We all gotta get out of here.

458
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:04,763
-I could drop out and get a job.
-Absolutely not.

459
00:32:04,804 --> 00:32:06,806
You got to finish.
I'll work something out.

460
00:32:10,393 --> 00:32:15,231
Derek, can we please go eat?
I'm fucking starving here.

461
00:32:15,273 --> 00:32:17,067
Go wait in the living room.

462
00:32:18,234 --> 00:32:20,403
I want him out of my house.

463
00:32:20,445 --> 00:32:21,946
I know. Look.

464
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:40,173
He's an idiot.
He's always been an idiot.

465
00:32:40,173 --> 00:32:42,884
He can't help it.
I got to do that paper.

466
00:32:42,926 --> 00:32:45,261
I'll catch up with you
later tonight.

467
00:32:45,303 --> 00:32:48,431
Not at Cameron's. I need you
to stay away from there.

468
00:32:48,473 --> 00:32:51,935
-We were going to hang.
-I'll explain it later.

469
00:32:51,977 --> 00:32:54,437
I just need you to stay away
from the party, all right?

470
00:32:54,479 --> 00:32:55,605
Whatever.

471
00:32:55,647 --> 00:32:59,234
Promise me you'll stay away
from that party tonight.

472
00:32:59,275 --> 00:33:01,528
I'm not fucking 14 anymore,
all right?

473
00:33:02,737 --> 00:33:04,030
Whatever.

474
00:33:06,032 --> 00:33:06,992
God!

475
00:33:13,123 --> 00:33:14,833
Come on, let's go.

476
00:33:16,459 --> 00:33:17,752
Where are you parked?

477
00:33:17,794 --> 00:33:19,045
Out back.

478
00:34:28,073 --> 00:34:29,783
Yeah, that's the whole bunch.

479
00:34:31,201 --> 00:34:34,120
It didn't take long for Derek
to make a name for himself...

480
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,247
and Cameron knew
just how to use it.

481
00:34:36,289 --> 00:34:37,624
You don't want to stick around?

482
00:34:37,666 --> 00:34:41,753
You know I'd love to,
but I got to be careful.

483
00:34:41,795 --> 00:34:43,797
Yeah, I know.

484
00:34:44,464 --> 00:34:46,341
I'll see you back at the house.

485
00:34:47,759 --> 00:34:49,135
Good luck.

486
00:34:49,135 --> 00:34:53,098
He sent Derek to the kids,
to the frustrated ones...

487
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:54,975
the ones who were sick
of getting their asses kicked...

488
00:34:55,016 --> 00:34:57,435
by black and Mexican gangs.

489
00:34:57,477 --> 00:35:00,313
"Don't just be some punk.
Be part of something."

490
00:35:00,355 --> 00:35:03,233
All right, let's go.
Pull it together.

491
00:35:03,274 --> 00:35:04,943
And everybody ate it up.

492
00:35:04,985 --> 00:35:07,404
They did whatever Derek
told them to.

493
00:35:08,405 --> 00:35:10,699
Let's go. We're not here
to fucking socialize.

494
00:35:12,492 --> 00:35:13,743
Shut the fuck up.

495
00:35:13,785 --> 00:35:14,995
Yeah, man.

496
00:35:15,036 --> 00:35:16,371
You want a little toke?

497
00:35:17,831 --> 00:35:19,249
Go ahead.

498
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:21,876
-Curtis, what is that?
-Come on, Derek.

499
00:35:21,918 --> 00:35:24,671
Weed is for niggers.
Put that away right now.

500
00:35:24,713 --> 00:35:25,964
Jesus fucking Christ.

501
00:35:26,006 --> 00:35:27,424
Have a little self-respect.

502
00:35:28,883 --> 00:35:32,846
All right, listen up.
We need to open our eyes.

503
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,766
There's over two million
illegal immigrants...

504
00:35:36,808 --> 00:35:39,311
bedding down
in this state tonight.

505
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:44,316
This state spent three
billion dollars last year...

506
00:35:44,357 --> 00:35:47,694
on services for those people
who had no right to be here.

507
00:35:47,736 --> 00:35:49,321
Three billion dollars.

508
00:35:49,362 --> 00:35:53,867
$400 million just to lock up
illegal immigrant criminals...

509
00:35:53,908 --> 00:35:57,704
who only got into this country
because the INS decided...

510
00:35:57,704 --> 00:36:01,750
it's not worth the effort
to screen for convicted felons.

511
00:36:03,752 --> 00:36:06,212
Our government
doesn't give a shit.

512
00:36:07,714 --> 00:36:12,052
Our border policy is a joke,
so is anybody surprised...

513
00:36:12,093 --> 00:36:14,387
that south of the border
they're laughing at us?

514
00:36:14,429 --> 00:36:16,681
Laughing at our laws?

515
00:36:16,723 --> 00:36:18,516
Every night, thousands
of these parasites...

516
00:36:18,558 --> 00:36:21,436
stream across the border like
some fucking piñata exploded.

517
00:36:21,478 --> 00:36:25,106
Don't laugh.
There's nothing funny here.

518
00:36:25,148 --> 00:36:27,192
This is about your life
and mine.

519
00:36:28,568 --> 00:36:30,695
It's about decent,
hard-working Americans...

520
00:36:30,737 --> 00:36:32,572
falling through the cracks
and getting the shaft...

521
00:36:32,614 --> 00:36:36,076
because their government
cares more about the rights...

522
00:36:36,076 --> 00:36:38,370
of a bunch of people
who aren't even citizens.

523
00:36:38,411 --> 00:36:40,455
On the Statue of Liberty
it says...

524
00:36:40,497 --> 00:36:43,208
"Give me your tired,
your hungry, your poor."

525
00:36:43,249 --> 00:36:45,877
Well, it's Americans who are
tired and hungry and poor.

526
00:36:45,919 --> 00:36:48,088
Until you take care of that...

527
00:36:48,129 --> 00:36:51,132
close the fucking book,
because we're losing.

528
00:36:52,217 --> 00:36:55,679
We're losing our right
to pursue our destiny.

529
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:59,140
We're losing our freedom so
a bunch of fucking foreigners...

530
00:36:59,182 --> 00:37:01,351
can come in here
and exploit our country.

531
00:37:01,393 --> 00:37:04,479
And this isn't something
that's going on far away.

532
00:37:04,521 --> 00:37:07,565
This isn't happening places
we can't do anything about it.

533
00:37:07,607 --> 00:37:10,068
It's happening here.
Right in our neighborhood.

534
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,195
Right in that building
behind you.

535
00:37:12,237 --> 00:37:15,699
Archie Miller ran that grocery
store since we were kids here.

536
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:18,618
Dave worked there.
Mike worked there.

537
00:37:18,618 --> 00:37:20,996
He went under, and now
some fucking Korean owns it...

538
00:37:21,037 --> 00:37:23,540
who fired these guys
and is making a killing...

539
00:37:23,581 --> 00:37:26,918
because he hired
40 fucking border jumpers.

540
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,336
I see this shit going on...

541
00:37:28,378 --> 00:37:30,380
and I don't see anybody
doing anything about it...

542
00:37:30,422 --> 00:37:32,299
and it fucking pisses me off.

543
00:37:34,467 --> 00:37:36,428
So look around you.

544
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:38,805
This isn't
our fucking neighborhood.

545
00:37:38,847 --> 00:37:41,599
It's a battlefield.
We're on a battlefield tonight.

546
00:37:41,641 --> 00:37:43,310
Make a decision.

547
00:37:43,351 --> 00:37:46,021
Are we going to stand
on the sidelines?

548
00:37:46,062 --> 00:37:48,732
Quietly standing there
while our country gets raped?

549
00:37:49,774 --> 00:37:52,652
Are we going to ante up
and do something about it?

550
00:37:54,112 --> 00:37:55,488
You're goddamn right.

551
00:38:08,126 --> 00:38:10,754
Come here!
Don't you know it's illegal...

552
00:38:10,795 --> 00:38:13,423
to hire fucking border jumpers,
you nip bastard?

553
00:38:21,181 --> 00:38:22,641
Hey, sweetheart.

554
00:38:22,682 --> 00:38:24,851
No. You don't need this.
We're not going to hurt you.

555
00:38:24,893 --> 00:38:26,478
Please, please! No!

556
00:38:29,439 --> 00:38:30,649
You fucking spic!

557
00:38:33,568 --> 00:38:36,237
-No! Please!
-This bitch deserves it.

558
00:38:36,279 --> 00:38:40,533
This bitch stinks. Smells like
fish and chips and guacamole.

559
00:38:40,575 --> 00:38:42,035
Here we go.

560
00:38:53,046 --> 00:38:54,798
Goddamn!

561
00:38:58,802 --> 00:39:00,512
Get the fuck off me,
motherfucker!

562
00:39:07,852 --> 00:39:09,396
Viva la Mexico!

563
00:39:14,234 --> 00:39:16,236
Have a fucking bean,
you fucking beaner!

564
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:27,205
Get some of that in there.
Throw it on.

565
00:39:27,247 --> 00:39:29,124
That's a great color on you.

566
00:39:29,165 --> 00:39:31,084
Now you can get
a white woman's job.

567
00:39:31,126 --> 00:39:33,128
A little better
than this one, huh?

568
00:39:33,169 --> 00:39:34,754
Yeah, white.

569
00:39:34,796 --> 00:39:36,631
Then you'll move up
in the world.

570
00:39:38,341 --> 00:39:39,634
Asshole!

571
00:39:41,594 --> 00:39:42,721
Let's go!

572
00:39:42,762 --> 00:39:44,347
Everybody out!

573
00:39:44,389 --> 00:39:45,890
Now! Now!

574
00:39:48,852 --> 00:39:50,729
All right, let's go!

575
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:52,230
Come on!

576
00:39:52,272 --> 00:39:53,857
Come on, let's go.

577
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:02,365
No green card, no fucking work.
Comprende?

578
00:40:04,784 --> 00:40:05,910
Come on!

579
00:40:05,952 --> 00:40:07,954
We're fucking going! Come on!

580
00:40:34,314 --> 00:40:38,234
Dad was gone, but things
were almost normal again.

581
00:40:38,276 --> 00:40:39,986
Derek had a good job.

582
00:40:40,028 --> 00:40:41,780
Mom was starting
to live a little.

583
00:40:41,821 --> 00:40:46,117
Everyone was feeling so good,
we just didn't see it coming.

584
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,869
Maybe we should've.

585
00:40:47,911 --> 00:40:50,205
The irony is
that most of the stores...

586
00:40:50,246 --> 00:40:52,832
destroyed during the riots
were owned by black people.

587
00:40:52,874 --> 00:40:55,961
That's stupid, though.
Why trash your own neighborhood?

588
00:40:56,002 --> 00:40:59,005
Well, that's my point.
It's an irrational act.

589
00:40:59,005 --> 00:41:01,132
It's like an expression
of rage...

590
00:41:01,174 --> 00:41:05,136
by people who feel neglected
and turned away by the system.

591
00:41:05,178 --> 00:41:10,725
It's like we had in Watts
or the riots in Chicago in '68.

592
00:41:10,767 --> 00:41:12,310
I don't buy that.

593
00:41:12,352 --> 00:41:14,813
Calling a riot an irrational
expression of rage.

594
00:41:14,854 --> 00:41:17,732
That's such a cop-out.
It's opportunism at its worst.

595
00:41:17,774 --> 00:41:19,985
It's people grabbing
any excuse they can find...

596
00:41:20,026 --> 00:41:21,861
to go and loot a store,
nothing more.

597
00:41:21,903 --> 00:41:24,197
The fact that these people
ripped off the stores...

598
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:26,199
in their own communities,
all that reflects...

599
00:41:26,241 --> 00:41:29,202
is that they have no respect
for the law at all...

600
00:41:29,202 --> 00:41:31,830
and certainly no concept
of community...

601
00:41:31,871 --> 00:41:33,540
or civic responsibility.

602
00:41:33,581 --> 00:41:34,749
Now wait a minute.

603
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:37,335
White people commit crimes
against white people, too.

604
00:41:37,377 --> 00:41:40,839
Yeah, but they're not offing
each other in record numbers.

605
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,841
Look at the statistics,
for Christ's sake.

606
00:41:42,882 --> 00:41:45,010
One in every three
black males...

607
00:41:45,051 --> 00:41:47,387
is in some phase
of the correctional system.

608
00:41:47,429 --> 00:41:48,680
Is that a coincidence...

609
00:41:48,722 --> 00:41:51,558
or do these people have
a racial commitment to crime?

610
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,893
Not only that.
They're proud of it.

611
00:41:53,935 --> 00:41:56,062
Maybe it says something
about prejudice...

612
00:41:56,104 --> 00:41:57,272
in the judicial system.

613
00:41:57,314 --> 00:41:59,566
If you want to talk
about criminal statistics...

614
00:41:59,607 --> 00:42:03,111
take a look at the social
inequalities that produce them.

615
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:05,196
That's exactly what I hate.

616
00:42:05,238 --> 00:42:08,325
You're taking one thing
and calling it something else...

617
00:42:08,366 --> 00:42:10,744
and just alleviating
the responsibility...

618
00:42:10,785 --> 00:42:12,370
these people have
for their own actions.

619
00:42:12,412 --> 00:42:15,790
It's like saying,
it's not a riot, it's rage.

620
00:42:15,832 --> 00:42:19,377
It's not crime, it's poverty.
That's just nonsense.

621
00:42:19,419 --> 00:42:21,338
It's exactly what happened
in this trial...

622
00:42:21,379 --> 00:42:23,131
because the media
twisted things around...

623
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:25,842
so people got all focused
on these cops...

624
00:42:25,884 --> 00:42:27,218
and whether or not they were
going to get convicted...

625
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:30,388
and whether Rodney King's
civil rights had been violated.

626
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:32,641
Everybody lost sight
of old Rodney King himself.

627
00:42:32,682 --> 00:42:35,769
The guy's a multiple felon
by his own admission.

628
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:37,646
He's high as a goddamn kite...

629
00:42:37,687 --> 00:42:40,357
driving 120 miles an hour
down the highway.

630
00:42:40,398 --> 00:42:42,400
He gets pulled over
by a bunch of cops...

631
00:42:42,442 --> 00:42:43,902
and he attacks them.

632
00:42:43,943 --> 00:42:45,236
He attacked police officers.

633
00:42:45,278 --> 00:42:46,780
That's the bottom line,
and he walked.

634
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:49,115
And there's some yahoo there
with a video camera...

635
00:42:49,157 --> 00:42:50,533
who turned it on
halfway through...

636
00:42:50,575 --> 00:42:52,911
so that all we see
is them hitting him.

637
00:42:52,953 --> 00:42:56,581
You got Powell and Koon
cracking him with billy clubs...

638
00:42:56,623 --> 00:42:58,875
and Briseno's kicking him
in the back of the skull...

639
00:42:58,917 --> 00:43:00,293
so it looks severe, you know?

640
00:43:00,335 --> 00:43:01,628
People are going,
"Oh, this poor guy."

641
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:03,672
This poor guy
who attacked four cops...

642
00:43:03,713 --> 00:43:05,548
and those cops
end up on the stand...

643
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:10,178
defending themselves for using
standard textbook procedures.

644
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,305
I don't think the tapes
showed that at all.

645
00:43:12,347 --> 00:43:15,433
You didn't think so?
And you're an authority?

646
00:43:15,475 --> 00:43:17,769
Murray, what do you think?

647
00:43:19,479 --> 00:43:23,400
I did think the police used
their clubs rather excessively.

648
00:43:23,441 --> 00:43:25,110
Who are you
to say what's excessive?

649
00:43:25,151 --> 00:43:26,820
I think it was
totally appropriate.

650
00:43:26,861 --> 00:43:29,948
They're in a better position
to make that call than you are.

651
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:33,785
We, as society, grant cops
a certain amount of authority...

652
00:43:33,827 --> 00:43:35,996
to make those calls,
because we acknowledge...

653
00:43:36,037 --> 00:43:38,248
that their job is difficult
and dangerous.

654
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:42,168
Very few people respect that
and respect that authority.

655
00:43:42,168 --> 00:43:45,088
Look who's talking about
respect--Mr. Junior KKK.

656
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:46,298
What?

657
00:43:48,091 --> 00:43:50,302
You want to go to college?
Learn to listen.

658
00:43:50,343 --> 00:43:53,638
I didn't say I respect the laws.
I acknowledge a cop's authority.

659
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,225
I don't respect laws that let
Rodney King back on the street.

660
00:43:57,267 --> 00:44:00,562
Second, I am not a member
of a low-rent...

661
00:44:00,603 --> 00:44:04,733
disorganized bunch of rednecks
like the fucking KKK. Please.

662
00:44:04,774 --> 00:44:07,527
So take your head
out of your ass.

663
00:44:07,569 --> 00:44:09,362
You've gotten off the point.

664
00:44:09,404 --> 00:44:11,990
I had a point.
That wasn't even the point.

665
00:44:12,032 --> 00:44:13,950
Do you have one?
What is your point?

666
00:44:13,992 --> 00:44:15,744
All right, think about this.

667
00:44:15,785 --> 00:44:18,288
If Danny was walking
across the street that night...

668
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:19,539
and Rodney King
plowed into him--

669
00:44:19,581 --> 00:44:21,666
Can we drop
this Rodney King thing?

670
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:33,094
Who would like some dessert?

671
00:44:34,929 --> 00:44:36,014
We're having a discussion.

672
00:44:36,056 --> 00:44:38,391
We're having
a nice discussion, right?

673
00:44:38,433 --> 00:44:39,893
If Rodney King
had been driving along...

674
00:44:39,934 --> 00:44:41,936
hopped up on PCP
and had killed Danny...

675
00:44:41,978 --> 00:44:43,438
you'd be singing
a different tune--

676
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,441
I didn't see him hit anybody,
and neither did you.

677
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:49,110
He didn't happen
to kill anybody, thank God.

678
00:44:49,152 --> 00:44:51,655
Keep it down, OK?
Ally's sleeping.

679
00:44:54,574 --> 00:44:58,203
If that fucking monkey
had run some kid over...

680
00:44:58,244 --> 00:45:01,456
everybody would have
a very different opinion.

681
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:04,709
They'd be focused on Rodney King
and not on these officers.

682
00:45:04,751 --> 00:45:06,753
But instead,
he just attacked a few cops...

683
00:45:06,795 --> 00:45:08,546
so, suddenly,
it's Hands Across America...

684
00:45:08,588 --> 00:45:10,632
for this fucking total
son of a bitch.

685
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:12,092
It blows my mind.

686
00:45:12,092 --> 00:45:14,970
We're so hung up on this notion
that we have some obligation...

687
00:45:15,011 --> 00:45:17,055
to help
this struggling black man.

688
00:45:17,097 --> 00:45:19,391
Cut him some slack
until he can overcome...

689
00:45:19,432 --> 00:45:20,767
these historical injustices.

690
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:23,269
It's crap. This stuff
just perpetuates it...

691
00:45:23,311 --> 00:45:24,813
all this liberal nonsense.

692
00:45:24,854 --> 00:45:26,314
Everyone's looking
the other way...

693
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:28,400
while our country rots
from the inside out.

694
00:45:28,441 --> 00:45:32,028
I mean, Christ, Lincoln freed
the slaves 130 years ago.

695
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:34,114
How long does it take
to get your act together?

696
00:45:34,155 --> 00:45:38,201
Jews have been persecuted
for over 5,000 years.

697
00:45:38,243 --> 00:45:40,620
Are you saying it's wrong
to feel sensitive...

698
00:45:40,662 --> 00:45:41,955
about anti-Semitism?

699
00:45:41,997 --> 00:45:43,331
Oh, forget that.

700
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:46,418
I'm with you. I'm with you
all the way, baby.

701
00:45:46,459 --> 00:45:48,253
I'm so sick of
these liberal hypocrites.

702
00:45:48,295 --> 00:45:50,422
Here we go again.
I love this part.

703
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,506
This is great.

704
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:53,466
Look how they scapegoated
Chief Gates.

705
00:45:53,508 --> 00:45:56,136
Think they would've come down
that hard on Willie Williams?

706
00:45:56,177 --> 00:45:59,556
No way. That videotape was
a set-up to get rid of Gates.

707
00:45:59,597 --> 00:46:02,934
-Can I be excused?
-No. Don't interrupt.

708
00:46:02,976 --> 00:46:05,270
Excuse me. I was talking.
I listened to you.

709
00:46:05,312 --> 00:46:08,982
-Who do you think you are?
-She's making a point.

710
00:46:09,024 --> 00:46:11,276
Davina, sit down.

711
00:46:11,318 --> 00:46:14,612
Be quiet! Shut up! Sit down!

712
00:46:14,654 --> 00:46:17,949
-Derek, calm down.
-Don't tell him to shut up!

713
00:46:17,991 --> 00:46:20,869
Sit your ass down. No.
Sit down. Shut your mouth.

714
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:23,538
Move! Goddamn it! Move!

715
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,832
Shut your mouth and give
my girlfriend respect.

716
00:46:25,874 --> 00:46:28,293
Derek, what are you
trying to prove?

717
00:46:28,335 --> 00:46:29,961
Murray, stay out of it!

718
00:46:30,003 --> 00:46:32,130
Where do you think you're going?

719
00:46:32,172 --> 00:46:35,008
Derek, let her go!

720
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:38,553
You need to learn
some fucking manners, Davina!

721
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:40,972
Shut your fucking mouth!

722
00:46:41,014 --> 00:46:42,182
Stop!

723
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:44,601
She can't breathe!

724
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:47,646
Let her go!

725
00:46:47,687 --> 00:46:49,731
You going to apologize?

726
00:46:51,691 --> 00:46:54,903
You're a fucking asshole.
I hate you!

727
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:06,998
What are you doing?
This is your family.

728
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,000
Right.
My family, so you know what?

729
00:47:09,042 --> 00:47:12,379
I don't give two shits about you
or what you think.

730
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:14,214
You're not a part of it.

731
00:47:14,255 --> 00:47:16,675
-That has nothing to do with it.
-It doesn't?

732
00:47:16,716 --> 00:47:18,510
You don't think
I see what you're doing?

733
00:47:18,551 --> 00:47:20,136
You think
I'll sit here and smile...

734
00:47:20,178 --> 00:47:22,681
while some fucking kike
tries to fuck my mother?

735
00:47:22,722 --> 00:47:25,642
It's never going to happen.
Fucking forget it.

736
00:47:25,684 --> 00:47:27,519
Not while I'm in this family.

737
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,604
I will fucking cut
your Shylock nose off...

738
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:32,357
and stick it up your ass
before I let that happen.

739
00:47:32,399 --> 00:47:34,901
Coming in here and poisoning
my family's dinner...

740
00:47:34,943 --> 00:47:38,196
with your Jewish,
nigger-loving, hippie bullshit.

741
00:47:41,741 --> 00:47:44,703
Fuck you. Fuck you.

742
00:47:44,744 --> 00:47:46,538
Yeah, walk out.

743
00:47:46,579 --> 00:47:49,082
Asshole. Fucking
cabala-reading motherfucker.

744
00:47:49,124 --> 00:47:50,667
Get out of my house.

745
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:57,882
You see this?
That means not welcome.

746
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,646
What did I do?

747
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:13,690
You disgust me.

748
00:48:13,732 --> 00:48:16,401
Bring him to our table, primping
your hair and your dress.

749
00:48:16,443 --> 00:48:18,611
What did I do?

750
00:48:18,653 --> 00:48:20,614
You're all tarted up.

751
00:48:20,655 --> 00:48:22,365
How could you bring him
to my father's table?

752
00:48:22,407 --> 00:48:25,577
How could you go from Dad
to that? Aren't you ashamed?

753
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:29,039
I'm ashamed that you
came out of my body!

754
00:48:32,459 --> 00:48:35,378
Go run to your fucking kike!
Run to him !

755
00:48:41,468 --> 00:48:44,429
It's OK.
I'm proud of you, baby.

756
00:48:51,144 --> 00:48:54,731
I'm so sorry, Doris.
I really am.

757
00:49:02,989 --> 00:49:04,115
He's gone.

758
00:49:04,157 --> 00:49:08,954
He's just a boy
without a father.

759
00:49:08,995 --> 00:49:12,707
Doris, you don't know the world
your children are living in.

760
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:24,219
Good-bye.

761
00:50:09,681 --> 00:50:11,266
Hey, you all right?

762
00:50:13,935 --> 00:50:16,896
-Take this, you fucking dick!
-No. Come here.

763
00:50:16,938 --> 00:50:18,523
-Fuck you!
-Calm down.

764
00:50:18,565 --> 00:50:19,899
-Let go of me!
-Calm down.

765
00:50:19,941 --> 00:50:21,192
Let me go, God damn it!

766
00:50:21,234 --> 00:50:23,445
-Fuck you!
-I'm sorry.

767
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:27,407
I would never hurt you.
You know that.

768
00:50:27,407 --> 00:50:31,036
I screwed up. I lost control.
It's not you.

769
00:50:31,077 --> 00:50:34,247
I'm sorry.
I'd never hurt you guys.

770
00:50:34,289 --> 00:50:36,958
You know that.
I'd do anything for you.

771
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,335
I don't believe you.

772
00:50:38,376 --> 00:50:40,712
I trust you, Derek.

773
00:50:51,931 --> 00:50:55,143
What are you doing out of bed?
Want a plane ride?

774
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:58,104
-Yeah.
-Going for takeoff.

775
00:51:04,277 --> 00:51:05,695
Oh, no, don't crash.

776
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:10,742
Better go to Mom.
She's a crazy flier.

777
00:51:10,784 --> 00:51:13,787
Kiss Mom. Oh, yeah.

778
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:25,715
-You don't feel too hot.
-No. It's my chest.

779
00:51:25,757 --> 00:51:28,259
-What are you up to?
-I'm just thinking.

780
00:51:28,301 --> 00:51:30,804
Yeah? There's a lot of that
going around.

781
00:51:30,804 --> 00:51:33,682
I don't even know
how we got here sometimes.

782
00:51:33,723 --> 00:51:36,476
I feel like I let you down, only
I didn't know when it happened.

783
00:51:36,518 --> 00:51:38,228
Mom, it's OK.

784
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:44,150
It's cold in here.
No wonder you're sick.

785
00:51:44,192 --> 00:51:46,861
You don't get sick from cold.
You get sick from germs.

786
00:51:46,903 --> 00:51:49,656
No. You get sick from smoking.

787
00:51:50,824 --> 00:51:54,369
You ought to quit.
It's not good for you.

788
00:52:00,125 --> 00:52:02,127
What are you looking at me
like that for?

789
00:52:02,168 --> 00:52:04,879
When are you going to let
that beautiful hair grow back?

790
00:52:06,673 --> 00:52:08,758
The day you quit smoking.

791
00:52:11,803 --> 00:52:13,346
Deal.

792
00:52:13,388 --> 00:52:18,143
I'd better get Ally to bed.
You say good night to Mom?

793
00:52:18,184 --> 00:52:20,312
Then you have to go to bed.
Come on.

794
00:52:20,353 --> 00:52:22,856
-Good night, Mama.
-Good night, baby.

795
00:52:57,223 --> 00:53:00,769
I go back to that night
again and again in my mind.

796
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:03,104
I try to stop it from happening.

797
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:05,023
I want you out of this house.

798
00:53:05,065 --> 00:53:07,025
That's fine.
I'll be gone in the morning.

799
00:53:08,401 --> 00:53:09,694
He can move in with me.

800
00:53:11,071 --> 00:53:13,323
In my mind, I imagine
what would've happened...

801
00:53:13,365 --> 00:53:16,743
if I hadn't gone to that room
and told him.

802
00:53:18,078 --> 00:53:19,287
Get down!

803
00:53:20,622 --> 00:53:21,998
No, Derek!

804
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:26,044
Help, Mommy!

805
00:53:40,016 --> 00:53:43,311
Nigger, you just fucked
with the wrong bull. Come here!

806
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:44,437
Damn!

807
00:53:44,479 --> 00:53:47,941
Should've learned your place on
the fucking basketball court...

808
00:53:47,941 --> 00:53:49,693
but you fucking monkeys
never get the message!

809
00:53:51,319 --> 00:53:53,697
My father gave me that truck,
you motherfucker!

810
00:53:53,738 --> 00:53:57,409
You ever shoot at firemen?
You shoot at my family?

811
00:53:57,450 --> 00:53:59,828
I'm going to teach you a real
lesson now, motherfucker.

812
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:02,080
Put your fucking mouth
on the curb.

813
00:54:02,122 --> 00:54:03,123
Hold on, man.

814
00:54:03,123 --> 00:54:06,084
Put it on the curb right now!

815
00:54:09,504 --> 00:54:10,463
That's it.

816
00:54:10,505 --> 00:54:12,257
Derek, no!

817
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,305
Now say good night.

818
00:54:31,151 --> 00:54:32,110
Fucker.

819
00:54:38,283 --> 00:54:41,745
Drop your weapon!
Put your weapon on the ground!

820
00:54:41,828 --> 00:54:43,788
Put your hands up!

821
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:47,292
I said get your hands up!
Now turn around!

822
00:54:56,426 --> 00:54:58,970
Put your hands behind your head!

823
00:55:02,682 --> 00:55:04,684
Get down on your knees
right now!

824
00:56:02,409 --> 00:56:06,246
It's all right.

825
00:56:08,206 --> 00:56:09,332
Let's go.

826
00:56:11,293 --> 00:56:14,129
-Come on.
-No.

827
00:56:21,594 --> 00:56:23,179
She ain't gonna open the door?

828
00:56:23,221 --> 00:56:25,807
Someone right fucking there
looking at us. Hello?

829
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:27,475
Danny, it's for you.

830
00:56:28,476 --> 00:56:30,312
Be right there.

831
00:56:43,491 --> 00:56:46,494
Open the door, Danny.
It's fucking freezing!

832
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:48,538
Danny, I'm gonna be sick!

833
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:51,583
Come on, Danny!

834
00:57:22,155 --> 00:57:23,531
I'm gonna go get some beers.

835
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:38,797
Hey, what a party, fatso?

836
00:57:38,838 --> 00:57:42,634
I'm not fat, asshole!
I'm husky!

837
00:57:42,676 --> 00:57:44,678
What the fuck's up, Seth?

838
00:57:44,719 --> 00:57:46,972
Drink up, Danny,
before your brother sees you.

839
00:57:47,013 --> 00:57:48,223
Holy fuck, he's here!

840
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:51,518
Yeah, he's fucking here.
Go pay your respects.

841
00:57:51,559 --> 00:57:52,560
Fuck you, Seth!

842
00:57:54,938 --> 00:57:57,649
Let's go talk to Cameron, Danny.

843
00:57:57,691 --> 00:57:59,484
-Father Vinyard?
-How's it going?

844
00:57:59,526 --> 00:58:02,320
I'm Jason, this is Chris.
We're friends with your brother.

845
00:58:02,362 --> 00:58:05,073
You are a fucking god, man!

846
00:58:23,216 --> 00:58:25,135
I thought you turned
that paper in.

847
00:58:25,176 --> 00:58:27,971
I did. Now fucking Murray
turned me in...

848
00:58:28,013 --> 00:58:31,224
so Sweeney's making me
write another one.

849
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:36,104
Good old Sweeney.
He never stops trying.

850
00:58:36,146 --> 00:58:39,107
He's one of those
"proud to be nigger" people.

851
00:58:39,149 --> 00:58:40,567
I hate those guys.

852
00:58:40,567 --> 00:58:43,778
Wait a minute, Danny.
He's not proud.

853
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:49,284
No. He's a manipulative,
self-righteous Uncle Tom.

854
00:58:49,326 --> 00:58:52,537
He's making you feel guilty
about writing on Adolf Hitler.

855
00:58:52,579 --> 00:58:57,709
Some nigger, some spic writes
about Martin Luther King...

856
00:58:57,751 --> 00:59:02,255
or fucking Cesar commie Chavez
gets a pat on the head.

857
00:59:02,297 --> 00:59:04,382
Yeah.

858
00:59:04,424 --> 00:59:08,261
You can see the hypocrisy
in that, can't you?

859
00:59:08,303 --> 00:59:09,304
Definitely.

860
00:59:13,767 --> 00:59:15,310
Come on, let's go.

861
00:59:15,352 --> 00:59:18,188
No. Listen. Wait.

862
00:59:18,229 --> 00:59:20,190
I want to see you, OK?

863
00:59:20,231 --> 00:59:23,234
I do, but I gotta
take care of something tonight.

864
00:59:25,153 --> 00:59:27,781
-OK.
-You understand?

865
00:59:27,822 --> 00:59:31,159
Yeah. I'm here.
When you're ready, I'm here.

866
00:59:34,955 --> 00:59:37,540
-Would you do something with me?
-Anything.

867
00:59:37,582 --> 00:59:39,542
Leave with me.

868
00:59:39,626 --> 00:59:42,128
Leave where?

869
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:46,091
Leave here. Leave all this.
Just come with me.

870
00:59:46,132 --> 00:59:48,093
Why would you want to leave?

871
00:59:48,134 --> 00:59:49,761
They worship you.
You're like a god to them.

872
00:59:49,803 --> 00:59:53,264
If we had it good before, wait
till you see what it's like now.

873
00:59:53,306 --> 00:59:56,935
I don't want all that.
I don't want my family involved.

874
00:59:56,977 --> 00:59:59,521
Everything I've done here
fucked it all up, understand?

875
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:01,606
You think what you did
was wrong?

876
01:00:01,648 --> 01:00:04,484
Oh, baby. Oh, come on.

877
01:00:04,526 --> 01:00:07,070
Those niggers got exactly
what they deserved...

878
01:00:07,112 --> 01:00:09,447
and we all know that.

879
01:00:09,489 --> 01:00:12,617
I understand you just got out,
but no one's gonna hurt you.

880
01:00:12,659 --> 01:00:15,120
No one can touch you.
There's a small army out there.

881
01:00:15,161 --> 01:00:17,747
We're not gonna let
a bunch of spooks kick us out.

882
01:00:17,789 --> 01:00:20,083
You're not listening to me.
I'm not scared.

883
01:00:20,125 --> 01:00:22,335
I don't want it anymore.

884
01:00:22,377 --> 01:00:26,006
I'm done with it.
I'm through with this.

885
01:00:26,047 --> 01:00:30,927
It's bullshit, Stacey.

886
01:00:30,969 --> 01:00:34,055
You don't need this, Stacey.
Come on, trust me.

887
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:37,851
If you want to be with me,
just trust me. Come with me.

888
01:00:37,892 --> 01:00:39,144
Come on.

889
01:00:39,185 --> 01:00:42,647
You're nuts. You are nuts.
No way.

890
01:00:42,689 --> 01:00:45,734
I don't think you realize
what's been going on here.

891
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:49,571
We are 10 times what we were,
and we are bloody organized.

892
01:00:49,613 --> 01:00:52,157
It is like nothing
you have ever seen.

893
01:00:52,198 --> 01:00:54,034
This was a mistake. Forget it.

894
01:00:54,075 --> 01:00:56,494
Wait a second.
What was a mistake?

895
01:00:56,536 --> 01:00:58,747
Stacey, just say good-bye.

896
01:00:58,788 --> 01:01:01,708
This isn't you. I know you.

897
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:03,668
You don't know anything
about me, Stacey.

898
01:01:11,384 --> 01:01:13,887
-Are you Danny's brother?
-Yeah.

899
01:01:13,887 --> 01:01:16,931
Will you tell him
Lizzy's looking for him?

900
01:01:16,973 --> 01:01:18,933
Thank you.

901
01:01:20,685 --> 01:01:24,522
We'll let the niggers, kikes,
and spics grab for the pie.

902
01:01:24,564 --> 01:01:26,733
Can't blame 'em.

903
01:01:26,775 --> 01:01:29,277
Course, they're gonna
have to fight to get it.

904
01:01:31,071 --> 01:01:33,865
And if we scare
the fuck out of people...

905
01:01:33,907 --> 01:01:37,911
and a few people get killed
in the process, so be it.

906
01:01:37,953 --> 01:01:40,622
Gonna put that
in your paper, Danny?

907
01:01:40,664 --> 01:01:43,375
Hey, man.

908
01:01:43,416 --> 01:01:47,754
Well, look who's here.
The return of the soldier.

909
01:01:47,796 --> 01:01:49,798
What are you doing here, Danny?

910
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:52,926
Come on, man.
I had to check it out.

911
01:01:52,968 --> 01:01:54,219
You knew I was gonna come.

912
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:58,223
Let the kid alone, Derek.
He knows when to go to bed.

913
01:02:00,225 --> 01:02:01,393
Go wait outside.

914
01:02:01,434 --> 01:02:03,728
Come on, Der.
I'm not doing anything.

915
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:07,190
This little blonde girl
keeps asking for you.

916
01:02:07,273 --> 01:02:09,025
She's dying. Come on.

917
01:02:09,067 --> 01:02:11,486
-I gotta check out.
-Go easy on her.

918
01:02:11,528 --> 01:02:13,530
All right.

919
01:02:17,367 --> 01:02:18,994
Wait for me right outside.

920
01:02:23,832 --> 01:02:26,001
Take it easy.

921
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:28,461
Chill out.

922
01:02:28,503 --> 01:02:30,922
You're on safe ground.

923
01:02:30,964 --> 01:02:33,675
You don't have to watch
your ass around here.

924
01:02:35,135 --> 01:02:37,095
Come on. Sit down. Relax.

925
01:02:39,139 --> 01:02:41,933
I'm sorry.
The party was a little quick...

926
01:02:41,975 --> 01:02:45,228
but we're just so damn glad
you're back, Derek.

927
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:47,314
It's only natural
you should feel a little funny.

928
01:02:47,355 --> 01:02:48,815
I don't feel funny, Cam.

929
01:02:48,857 --> 01:02:51,610
You made the fat kid
a little nervous.

930
01:02:51,651 --> 01:02:53,653
He thinks the joint
messed with your mind.

931
01:02:53,653 --> 01:02:55,155
It did.

932
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:06,333
Glory, glory, hallelujah...

933
01:03:06,374 --> 01:03:11,046
Glory, glory, hallelujah...

934
01:03:11,087 --> 01:03:14,424
The white man marches on!

935
01:03:14,466 --> 01:03:17,636
Things have changed
since you've been gone.

936
01:03:17,677 --> 01:03:19,846
You talk about organization?

937
01:03:19,888 --> 01:03:22,807
Wait'll you see what
we've done with the internet.

938
01:03:22,849 --> 01:03:24,809
We've got every gang
from Seattle to San Diego...

939
01:03:24,851 --> 01:03:26,436
working together now.

940
01:03:26,478 --> 01:03:28,938
Not competing anymore.
They're consolidated.

941
01:03:29,022 --> 01:03:31,399
Only thing we lack is
a little overall leadership.

942
01:03:31,441 --> 01:03:34,611
That's where you come in.

943
01:03:34,653 --> 01:03:37,697
Those people out there got
a lot of respect for you.

944
01:03:37,739 --> 01:03:39,991
When you're ready,
come talk to me about it.

945
01:03:40,033 --> 01:03:43,787
You can forget about that.
I'm done with it, Cam.

946
01:03:43,828 --> 01:03:47,457
Yeah, well,
I know you grew out of...

947
01:03:47,499 --> 01:03:51,002
that shaved head bullshit
a long time ago, thank God.

948
01:03:51,044 --> 01:03:52,796
I like your hair
the way it is now.

949
01:03:52,837 --> 01:03:55,840
See, that's what I mean.
We're thinking bigger now.

950
01:03:55,882 --> 01:03:57,634
No more of this fucking
grocery store--

951
01:03:57,676 --> 01:03:59,552
You're not listening to me.
I am done with it.

952
01:03:59,594 --> 01:04:01,846
All that bullshit out there
and all your bullshit, too.

953
01:04:01,888 --> 01:04:03,556
I'm out.

954
01:04:03,598 --> 01:04:06,726
I understand how you feel.
You've just done hard time.

955
01:04:06,768 --> 01:04:08,895
Don't you fucking talk to me
about hard time.

956
01:04:08,937 --> 01:04:11,106
-You don't know anything.
-I've done mine.

957
01:04:11,147 --> 01:04:13,566
You didn't do shit.
I found out about you.

958
01:04:13,566 --> 01:04:15,568
You did two months,
then rolled over on two kids...

959
01:04:15,568 --> 01:04:17,529
and let them go down for you.

960
01:04:17,570 --> 01:04:19,531
So don't feed me
your fucking lies, Cameron.

961
01:04:21,324 --> 01:04:24,744
All right. This is stupid.
I'm done.

962
01:04:24,786 --> 01:04:27,455
You go cool off.
Get laid. Do something.

963
01:04:27,497 --> 01:04:30,333
Get your head on straight,
and then I'll talk to you.

964
01:04:30,375 --> 01:04:32,460
But it doesn't matter
if I don't, does it?

965
01:04:32,502 --> 01:04:34,462
'Cause you got the next crop...

966
01:04:34,504 --> 01:04:36,298
lined up and ready to go,
you fucking chicken hawk.

967
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:38,216
Excuse me?

968
01:04:38,258 --> 01:04:40,885
You prey on people, Cam !
You use them !

969
01:04:40,927 --> 01:04:44,014
I lost three years of my life
for your fucking phony cause...

970
01:04:44,055 --> 01:04:45,807
but I am on to you now,
you fucking snake.

971
01:04:45,849 --> 01:04:49,936
Derek, watch it. Be careful.
Remember where you are.

972
01:04:49,978 --> 01:04:53,648
This isn't some fucking country
club you can waltz in and out--

973
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:55,483
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

974
01:04:55,525 --> 01:04:58,445
I came here to tell you
one thing. I am out.

975
01:04:58,445 --> 01:05:00,363
Out! And Danny is out, too!

976
01:05:00,405 --> 01:05:02,657
If you come near my family,
I'll fucking kill you.

977
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:05,160
Excuse me, but fuck you, Derek.

978
01:05:05,201 --> 01:05:07,495
You can't come
barking threats at me.

979
01:05:07,537 --> 01:05:10,415
You can do whatever you want,
but Danny is a good kid.

980
01:05:10,457 --> 01:05:12,792
He's not some whiny pussy
like you.

981
01:05:12,834 --> 01:05:14,794
He needs my help,
and I'm gonna give it to him.

982
01:05:14,794 --> 01:05:17,297
If you come near Danny again...

983
01:05:17,297 --> 01:05:19,507
I will feed you
your fucking heart, Cameron.

984
01:05:19,549 --> 01:05:25,388
I won't have to.
He'll come to me.

985
01:05:25,430 --> 01:05:27,599
I'm more important to him now
than you'll ever be.

986
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:33,104
Shit.

987
01:05:33,146 --> 01:05:36,107
You're a fucking dead man,
Vinyard.

988
01:05:51,623 --> 01:05:54,960
Hey, where's Cameron?
Where the fuck is he?

989
01:05:57,629 --> 01:05:59,798
Stay away from me, Stacey.
Danny!

990
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:01,800
Why don't you share
with the rest of us...

991
01:06:01,841 --> 01:06:05,387
what you just said to me,
you piece of shit nigger!

992
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:07,639
You monkey-fucking traitor!

993
01:06:07,681 --> 01:06:09,432
You a fucking nigger-fucker?

994
01:06:09,474 --> 01:06:11,434
Hey, Danny! Come on!

995
01:06:11,476 --> 01:06:13,937
He's a fucking nigger!
Nigger! Nigger!

996
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:16,940
Cam's out cold!
Where the fuck are you going?

997
01:06:16,982 --> 01:06:18,942
Gun! He's got a gun!

998
01:06:19,025 --> 01:06:21,319
Shit! Back up!

999
01:06:22,904 --> 01:06:24,823
You make me fucking sick!

1000
01:06:24,864 --> 01:06:27,701
Put down the fucking gun!

1001
01:06:27,742 --> 01:06:28,952
Shoot the nigger!

1002
01:06:28,994 --> 01:06:32,831
Shoot him !
Do it, Seth! Shoot him !

1003
01:06:32,872 --> 01:06:35,083
Traitor!

1004
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:36,501
Do it, Seth! Do it!

1005
01:06:39,671 --> 01:06:41,464
Back up! Move!

1006
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:45,844
Back up! Back the fuck up!

1007
01:06:45,885 --> 01:06:48,305
Move! Move!

1008
01:06:48,346 --> 01:06:49,639
Easy, Derek! Hey!

1009
01:07:11,328 --> 01:07:12,287
Easy, Danny!

1010
01:07:12,329 --> 01:07:14,372
Who do you think you are?

1011
01:07:14,414 --> 01:07:17,417
-Danny, relax.
-Who do you think you are?

1012
01:07:17,459 --> 01:07:19,753
Take it easy, Dan.

1013
01:07:19,794 --> 01:07:21,880
I fucking hate you, Der!

1014
01:07:21,921 --> 01:07:23,923
All right. I mean it.

1015
01:07:23,965 --> 01:07:25,425
Huh?

1016
01:07:25,467 --> 01:07:28,053
Come on. Shut up.
Take it easy.

1017
01:07:28,094 --> 01:07:30,055
What's happened to you, Der?

1018
01:07:30,096 --> 01:07:32,474
Take it easy.

1019
01:07:32,515 --> 01:07:34,851
What's happened to you, Der?

1020
01:07:42,943 --> 01:07:45,612
Come on. Come on.

1021
01:07:48,782 --> 01:07:50,909
It's just so fucked.

1022
01:07:50,951 --> 01:07:53,954
I'm sorry. You weren't
supposed to see that.

1023
01:07:53,954 --> 01:07:55,205
I told you not to come.

1024
01:07:55,246 --> 01:07:57,874
Fuck you, man.

1025
01:07:57,916 --> 01:07:59,459
That was so fucked up.

1026
01:07:59,501 --> 01:08:02,087
I know, I know.

1027
01:08:02,128 --> 01:08:04,756
God, it wasn't supposed
to happen that way.

1028
01:08:04,798 --> 01:08:08,093
That was fucked up.
That's all there is to it.

1029
01:08:08,134 --> 01:08:11,930
That's not what I planned.
It just all went to shit.

1030
01:08:11,972 --> 01:08:15,600
Just shit.
Got totally out of control.

1031
01:08:17,143 --> 01:08:19,938
What's fucking happening here?

1032
01:08:24,526 --> 01:08:25,902
Hey, look at me.

1033
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:31,741
I can't go back to that, Dan.

1034
01:08:31,783 --> 01:08:34,077
Can't go back to what?

1035
01:08:34,119 --> 01:08:36,204
To any of it.

1036
01:08:36,246 --> 01:08:38,790
Those guys, the gang, that life.
I'm done with it.

1037
01:08:43,003 --> 01:08:44,462
What happened to you up there?

1038
01:08:52,345 --> 01:08:54,431
Feed line. Back up for chow.

1039
01:08:54,472 --> 01:08:56,349
Don't be late,
you piece of shit!

1040
01:08:56,391 --> 01:09:00,395
Let's go if you want to eat!
Get up! Five minutes!

1041
01:09:00,437 --> 01:09:02,731
This is my fucking house!
Get up!

1042
01:09:02,772 --> 01:09:05,150
What the fuck's your problem,
you assholes?

1043
01:09:05,191 --> 01:09:08,361
Move! Let's go!
Open the fucking gates!

1044
01:09:08,403 --> 01:09:10,780
All right, rack 'em !

1045
01:09:15,452 --> 01:09:17,537
Five minutes! Step forward!

1046
01:09:17,579 --> 01:09:19,956
Those beds better be made.

1047
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:25,462
After two days, I didn't think
I'd make it a week.

1048
01:09:25,545 --> 01:09:27,631
Come on, you motherfuckers!

1049
01:09:27,672 --> 01:09:30,008
You want to eat today,
you fucking piece of shit?

1050
01:09:30,050 --> 01:09:32,010
Hey, you white trash
piece of shit!

1051
01:09:32,052 --> 01:09:33,970
You think you're
fucking special, whitefish?

1052
01:09:34,012 --> 01:09:37,182
Button that top button!
Let's go! Move!

1053
01:09:37,223 --> 01:09:40,435
Are you eyeballing me?
Don't eyeball-fuck me, asshole!

1054
01:09:40,477 --> 01:09:43,021
I'll fucking kill you!

1055
01:09:43,063 --> 01:09:46,066
I'm gonna keep my eye on you,
you white piece of shit!

1056
01:09:47,859 --> 01:09:50,820
Don't fucking eyeball me, boy!
I'll fucking skull-fuck you!

1057
01:09:50,904 --> 01:09:52,864
Step forward!

1058
01:09:54,199 --> 01:09:55,158
Turn to the left.

1059
01:09:57,243 --> 01:10:00,705
Step forward to chow! Let's go!

1060
01:10:00,747 --> 01:10:03,249
Come on!
Hey, fish, straight ahead.

1061
01:10:03,249 --> 01:10:05,585
Straight ahead, fucker!
Let's go!

1062
01:10:05,627 --> 01:10:08,755
All the wrong people
knew who I was anyway...

1063
01:10:08,797 --> 01:10:11,925
so I figured I'd put up a flag
and hope a friend sees it.

1064
01:11:14,404 --> 01:11:17,324
That's the cat I'm talking
about right there.

1065
01:11:36,509 --> 01:11:38,511
Boss.

1066
01:11:38,553 --> 01:11:40,138
Have a seat.

1067
01:11:41,181 --> 01:11:42,307
It's a pleasure.

1068
01:11:52,317 --> 01:11:54,778
Don't fuck with me, all right?

1069
01:11:54,819 --> 01:11:57,155
'Cause I'm the most dangerous
man in this prison.

1070
01:11:57,197 --> 01:12:01,117
You know why?
'Cause I control the underwear.

1071
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:11,920
We pick 'em up over here,
and we store 'em over there.

1072
01:12:11,962 --> 01:12:13,922
And I hope you work out,
all right?

1073
01:12:13,964 --> 01:12:16,967
'Cause the last guy they sent me
didn't wear no drawers...

1074
01:12:17,050 --> 01:12:19,177
couldn't read
the sizes in the drawers...

1075
01:12:19,219 --> 01:12:21,388
and used to sniff
the drawers, all right?

1076
01:12:21,429 --> 01:12:23,848
We got two sizes--medium
and large, all right?

1077
01:12:23,890 --> 01:12:26,351
All you gotta do is put
the mediums with the mediums...

1078
01:12:26,393 --> 01:12:28,019
and the larges with
the larges, all right?

1079
01:12:28,061 --> 01:12:30,021
I know it's a boring job...

1080
01:12:30,063 --> 01:12:32,232
but it's better than that
last shit they had me doing.

1081
01:12:32,274 --> 01:12:36,194
I spent two years in the kitchen
scrubbing hot-ass pots and pans.

1082
01:12:36,236 --> 01:12:39,114
That you don't wanna do,
all right?

1083
01:12:39,155 --> 01:12:41,157
You should be happy as shit
you landed this job.

1084
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:44,035
There's no telling what they'd
have you do up in the joint.

1085
01:12:45,578 --> 01:12:49,082
By the way...

1086
01:12:49,124 --> 01:12:50,750
what you in for?

1087
01:12:53,795 --> 01:12:55,422
Probably robbed
some old lady, huh?

1088
01:13:07,225 --> 01:13:09,519
OK, I know your kind, right?

1089
01:13:09,561 --> 01:13:11,896
Bad-ass peckerwood
with an attitude.

1090
01:13:13,523 --> 01:13:17,694
Let me tell you something, man,
you better watch your ass...

1091
01:13:17,736 --> 01:13:21,573
'cause in the joint,
you the nigger, not me.

1092
01:13:25,493 --> 01:13:29,164
I was a year in.
I thought I was cruising.

1093
01:13:29,205 --> 01:13:31,916
Then everything started
getting complicated.

1094
01:13:58,944 --> 01:14:00,570
What the fuck is that?

1095
01:14:02,030 --> 01:14:03,281
What's that all about?

1096
01:14:03,323 --> 01:14:06,993
That's just politics, man.
Favors, you know?

1097
01:14:08,578 --> 01:14:11,498
He's doing favors
for that fucking spic?

1098
01:14:12,582 --> 01:14:15,043
Mitch has just got
a little something extra...

1099
01:14:15,085 --> 01:14:17,420
on the side
with them boys, you know?

1100
01:14:17,462 --> 01:14:19,673
You're kidding, right?

1101
01:14:19,714 --> 01:14:21,841
No.

1102
01:14:21,883 --> 01:14:23,843
That's bullshit, man.

1103
01:14:23,843 --> 01:14:25,512
Somebody should say something
to him.

1104
01:14:25,553 --> 01:14:27,180
What the fuck is he thinking?

1105
01:14:27,222 --> 01:14:30,100
Mitch is the only reason
you're not a corpse right now.

1106
01:14:30,141 --> 01:14:32,560
You know what?
I don't fucking give a shit.

1107
01:14:32,602 --> 01:14:34,813
I can take care of myself.

1108
01:14:34,854 --> 01:14:38,775
He shouldn't be doing that.
I'm getting sick of it, man.

1109
01:14:38,817 --> 01:14:41,528
There's a lot of hard talk here
and no follow-through.

1110
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:48,118
I think you better chill out
on the preaching bullshit.

1111
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:50,578
We're getting a little tired
of that shit around here.

1112
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:54,165
Ease up on it.

1113
01:15:24,112 --> 01:15:25,447
What are you doing here, Doris?

1114
01:15:25,488 --> 01:15:27,657
I was in the neighborhood.

1115
01:15:27,699 --> 01:15:30,452
Look, I told you I don't want
you all coming up here.

1116
01:15:30,493 --> 01:15:33,663
I don't care
what you told me, OK?

1117
01:15:33,705 --> 01:15:34,998
I need to talk to you now.

1118
01:15:55,602 --> 01:15:57,103
So, how is everyone?

1119
01:15:57,145 --> 01:16:01,608
Davina's great. She's getting
straight As almost.

1120
01:16:01,608 --> 01:16:07,072
And Ally's walking,
starting to talk a little.

1121
01:16:12,118 --> 01:16:13,244
How's Danny?

1122
01:16:19,042 --> 01:16:21,836
He holds you up so high.

1123
01:16:21,878 --> 01:16:25,173
He thinks you're the greatest.

1124
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:28,343
He's always bragging
about you to Cameron...

1125
01:16:28,385 --> 01:16:30,303
and all his new friends.

1126
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:35,684
He's starting
to remind me of you.

1127
01:16:35,725 --> 01:16:38,687
Jesus, don't sound
so worried, all right?

1128
01:16:38,728 --> 01:16:42,774
I'm sure he's fine.
He's 16 years old, Doris.

1129
01:16:42,816 --> 01:16:44,567
He's not gonna be
a little angel forever.

1130
01:16:44,609 --> 01:16:47,070
You think because
I watched my firstborn...

1131
01:16:47,112 --> 01:16:49,739
fuck up his entire life
that I can sit here...

1132
01:16:49,781 --> 01:16:53,201
and see my baby follow
him down the same toilet?

1133
01:16:53,243 --> 01:16:54,953
I can't fix all this shit
from up here.

1134
01:16:54,995 --> 01:16:56,913
I'm not asking you to.

1135
01:16:56,955 --> 01:17:00,292
All it does is make me feel bad.
You're just making it harder.

1136
01:17:00,333 --> 01:17:03,878
You think you're the only one
doing time, Derek?

1137
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,131
You think
you're here all alone?

1138
01:17:06,172 --> 01:17:08,008
You think I'm not in here
with you?

1139
01:17:20,645 --> 01:17:22,105
Fuck, man.

1140
01:17:24,983 --> 01:17:27,277
Every day I watch you
go through these sheets...

1141
01:17:27,319 --> 01:17:29,154
like you gonna get
to the end of them.

1142
01:17:30,488 --> 01:17:32,616
Look, nigger,
will you chill the fuck out?

1143
01:17:32,657 --> 01:17:33,950
Goddamn!

1144
01:17:33,992 --> 01:17:36,161
No matter how fast
you get through them...

1145
01:17:36,202 --> 01:17:38,747
they gonna keep bringing them in
and bringing them in.

1146
01:17:38,788 --> 01:17:40,498
Throwing them around
like that...

1147
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:42,667
ain't gonna do a damn thing
but give you a heart attack!

1148
01:17:42,709 --> 01:17:44,461
And you know what?
That's cool with me!

1149
01:17:44,502 --> 01:17:46,921
But you gonna give me
a goddamn heart attack, too!

1150
01:17:55,513 --> 01:17:57,557
I know, I'm just a dumb,
stupid nigger, right?

1151
01:17:57,599 --> 01:17:59,309
What do I know?

1152
01:18:01,353 --> 01:18:04,898
I know I ain't the one getting
mad at them sheets, though.

1153
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:07,943
As a matter of fact,
the only sheets I get mad at...

1154
01:18:07,984 --> 01:18:09,945
I'll tell you.

1155
01:18:11,446 --> 01:18:14,032
All right, boy,
this is what we gonna do.

1156
01:18:14,074 --> 01:18:15,909
We gonna hate some niggers.
That's what we'll do today.

1157
01:18:15,951 --> 01:18:17,702
We gonna hate
some goddamn niggers.

1158
01:18:17,744 --> 01:18:19,245
That's all we gonna do is
hate some niggers all day.

1159
01:18:19,287 --> 01:18:22,457
Don't know what a nigger is,
but we gonna hate them.

1160
01:18:22,499 --> 01:18:24,417
My cousin Derek
is in the pen right now...

1161
01:18:24,459 --> 01:18:28,797
workin' next to a nigger,
driving him nigger crazy.

1162
01:18:46,982 --> 01:18:49,317
See? That's the ticket.

1163
01:18:50,318 --> 01:18:51,611
Nice and easy.

1164
01:18:53,154 --> 01:18:54,906
Now we can ignore
each other in peace.

1165
01:18:58,743 --> 01:19:01,454
"What are you doing?"
You know what he tells me?

1166
01:19:01,496 --> 01:19:04,249
"It's better than the pig
I just tried to fuck."

1167
01:19:07,168 --> 01:19:09,546
He never lets me
finish the joke.

1168
01:19:09,587 --> 01:19:11,047
You fuck him, too?

1169
01:19:13,091 --> 01:19:16,052
Whatever. She's laying on
her back, her legs are open...

1170
01:19:18,305 --> 01:19:22,267
What's up? How you doing?
There you go.

1171
01:19:33,361 --> 01:19:36,197
He was taking it
from the Mexicans...

1172
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:38,325
and dealing it out
to his own people.

1173
01:19:38,366 --> 01:19:41,411
He didn't believe in shit.
None of them did.

1174
01:20:07,103 --> 01:20:10,315
What? Come on, man.

1175
01:20:10,357 --> 01:20:14,569
Don't look at me like that.
You know what that smells like.

1176
01:20:14,611 --> 01:20:16,988
Don't tell me this smell
don't remind you of a woman.

1177
01:20:19,366 --> 01:20:20,742
God, I miss that smell, man.

1178
01:20:21,868 --> 01:20:25,288
The job I had on the outside
wasn't much better than this...

1179
01:20:25,372 --> 01:20:27,499
but at least I got
to go home every night...

1180
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:30,001
and lie down next to
that sweet smell, man.

1181
01:20:32,045 --> 01:20:35,507
God, I miss that.
You got a woman?

1182
01:20:36,675 --> 01:20:38,510
Yeah, you got a woman, man.

1183
01:20:38,551 --> 01:20:41,137
Let me give you some advice,
all right?

1184
01:20:41,179 --> 01:20:44,015
When she comes to visit you...

1185
01:20:44,057 --> 01:20:46,017
whatever you do,
no matter what...

1186
01:20:46,059 --> 01:20:48,019
don't let her leave here
in a fight, man.

1187
01:20:48,061 --> 01:20:50,021
Don't let her walk out
with a bad attitude...

1188
01:20:50,063 --> 01:20:52,691
'cause if you do,
you spend the next week...

1189
01:20:52,732 --> 01:20:55,527
wondering if she's getting her
fuck on with somebody else...

1190
01:20:55,568 --> 01:20:57,028
you know what I'm saying?

1191
01:20:57,070 --> 01:20:59,531
So when she come to see you,
it's nothing but sweet talk.

1192
01:20:59,572 --> 01:21:02,242
Send her away floating,
all right?

1193
01:21:02,284 --> 01:21:05,537
'Cause it's not like the real
world where you can fight...

1194
01:21:05,578 --> 01:21:08,707
'cause you can make up
and have that make-up sex.

1195
01:21:08,748 --> 01:21:10,625
Know what I'm saying?
That angry sex.

1196
01:21:10,667 --> 01:21:12,377
That sex with an attitude.

1197
01:21:12,419 --> 01:21:15,755
You lay on your back and let her
take out that aggression on you.

1198
01:21:15,797 --> 01:21:17,424
All guys know that, man.
That's that good sex.

1199
01:21:17,465 --> 01:21:20,302
That's that pow, pow, pow.

1200
01:21:20,343 --> 01:21:23,305
Let her get on top,
and she'll punish you first.

1201
01:21:23,346 --> 01:21:24,973
"You been a bad boy, huh?

1202
01:21:25,015 --> 01:21:27,851
"You been a bad boy,
and I'm gonna punish you.

1203
01:21:27,892 --> 01:21:29,477
"I'm gonna put it on you.

1204
01:21:29,519 --> 01:21:32,981
"Don't you ever...
let...me...catch...you...

1205
01:21:33,023 --> 01:21:36,318
"looking at...another...woman.
Yeah, yeah.

1206
01:21:36,359 --> 01:21:37,986
"I may forgive you
if you bring it.

1207
01:21:38,028 --> 01:21:40,488
"I think I can. I--I forgive.

1208
01:21:40,530 --> 01:21:43,617
"I forgive. Right there.
You're hitting it.

1209
01:21:43,658 --> 01:21:45,619
"My spot. That's it. Right.

1210
01:21:45,619 --> 01:21:49,456
"Yes. I for--I forgive you.
I forgive you.

1211
01:21:49,497 --> 01:21:52,125
"I for--I for--
I for--I forgive you!

1212
01:21:52,167 --> 01:21:54,336
"I love you!"

1213
01:22:11,853 --> 01:22:13,939
How do you figure the Lakers
to ever be a bigger dynasty...

1214
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:15,774
than the Celtics?

1215
01:22:15,815 --> 01:22:18,318
The Lakers
are a flare-up, a fluke.

1216
01:22:18,318 --> 01:22:19,527
Are you crazy?

1217
01:22:19,569 --> 01:22:21,613
One good coach for four years.
The Celtics are a dynasty!

1218
01:22:21,655 --> 01:22:24,282
Come on, man.
The Celtics, right?

1219
01:22:24,324 --> 01:22:26,534
The ugliest team in
the history of sports.

1220
01:22:26,576 --> 01:22:28,703
A dynasty of
ugly motherfuckers, man.

1221
01:22:28,745 --> 01:22:30,956
Look at Kevin McHale.

1222
01:22:30,997 --> 01:22:33,750
James Worthy. That guy
has a head like a melon.

1223
01:22:33,792 --> 01:22:35,126
He had ladies.

1224
01:22:35,168 --> 01:22:37,837
I can't even talk to you.
I don't know what you're saying.

1225
01:22:37,879 --> 01:22:40,799
You are tweaking.
Boston Celtics.

1226
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:42,968
-How many is that?
-That's enough.

1227
01:22:43,009 --> 01:22:44,177
Enough? All right.

1228
01:22:48,014 --> 01:22:49,349
You got that?

1229
01:22:54,020 --> 01:22:57,023
-I lost count, man.
-Doesn't matter, man.

1230
01:22:57,023 --> 01:22:59,526
Who's counting anyway?

1231
01:23:06,825 --> 01:23:08,994
All right,
so I wanna know something.

1232
01:23:09,995 --> 01:23:11,997
What the fuck
landed you in here?

1233
01:23:12,038 --> 01:23:14,249
You didn't kill anybody,
too skinny for a gangbanger.

1234
01:23:14,291 --> 01:23:16,960
Ain't that a bitch?
Don't judge a book by its cover.

1235
01:23:17,002 --> 01:23:18,420
I can throw these things.

1236
01:23:18,461 --> 01:23:21,339
Whatever. Come on.
What did you do?

1237
01:23:21,381 --> 01:23:23,967
None of your business.
It's embarrassing.

1238
01:23:24,009 --> 01:23:25,844
It's none of
your goddamn business.

1239
01:23:27,012 --> 01:23:29,973
Come on. Everybody in here
is embarrassed.

1240
01:23:30,015 --> 01:23:32,475
Nobody in here
got away with anything.

1241
01:23:33,518 --> 01:23:34,978
What'd you do?

1242
01:23:36,855 --> 01:23:39,482
Look, man, I stole a TV,
all right?

1243
01:23:39,524 --> 01:23:42,193
So you stole a TV.
What's embarrassing about that?

1244
01:23:42,235 --> 01:23:45,989
I stole a TV from a store
next to a doughnut shop.

1245
01:23:46,031 --> 01:23:48,992
I ran out, the owner's
right behind me yelling.

1246
01:23:49,034 --> 01:23:50,910
Bam ! I run into three cops.

1247
01:23:50,952 --> 01:23:54,414
I told you it was embarrassing.
You're laughing.

1248
01:23:54,456 --> 01:23:57,000
Wait a sec, wait a sec.

1249
01:23:57,042 --> 01:23:58,877
That don't make sense.

1250
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:03,965
Nah, you didn't get six years
for stealing a TV. Come on.

1251
01:24:04,007 --> 01:24:07,427
I come out, the police officer
grabs my arm...

1252
01:24:07,469 --> 01:24:09,429
the TV falls on his foot
and breaks it.

1253
01:24:09,429 --> 01:24:14,225
They said I threw the TV at him.
Assault. Six years.

1254
01:24:14,267 --> 01:24:18,396
Come on. Tell the truth.
You chucked it at him.

1255
01:24:18,438 --> 01:24:21,399
Like I said,
I came out of the store...

1256
01:24:21,441 --> 01:24:25,070
he grabbed my arm,
it fell on his foot.

1257
01:24:29,866 --> 01:24:31,117
Come on now.

1258
01:24:31,159 --> 01:24:33,912
What you got for me, huh?

1259
01:24:34,955 --> 01:24:36,289
There you go, baby!

1260
01:24:36,331 --> 01:24:38,708
Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about.

1261
01:25:17,247 --> 01:25:18,498
Fuck you!

1262
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:20,417
Give me a towel. Hold him.

1263
01:25:27,674 --> 01:25:29,509
You wanna be a nigger,
sweet boy?

1264
01:25:29,551 --> 01:25:32,137
-Fuck you!
-We gonna treat you like one.

1265
01:25:32,178 --> 01:25:35,307
-No.
-Come on.

1266
01:25:37,309 --> 01:25:38,977
Come on, give it to him !

1267
01:25:50,196 --> 01:25:51,740
Fuck you!

1268
01:25:55,702 --> 01:25:58,163
That was real sweet.

1269
01:25:58,204 --> 01:25:59,372
Fuck you!

1270
01:26:31,947 --> 01:26:32,989
How is he?

1271
01:26:34,157 --> 01:26:36,493
Well, he took six stitches.

1272
01:27:17,951 --> 01:27:20,954
Man, what the hell are you
doing here, anyway?

1273
01:27:20,954 --> 01:27:24,082
I came to talk about Danny, but
we don't have to do that now.

1274
01:27:24,124 --> 01:27:26,126
I brought you some books.

1275
01:27:28,461 --> 01:27:31,756
What about him, you know?
Don't keep me in suspense.

1276
01:27:31,798 --> 01:27:33,800
He's headed right where you are.

1277
01:27:34,801 --> 01:27:38,430
You know what? My mother
already laid this trip on me.

1278
01:27:38,471 --> 01:27:41,182
Danny's not my responsibility.

1279
01:27:41,224 --> 01:27:42,934
What do you expect me
to do with that?

1280
01:27:42,976 --> 01:27:45,770
It doesn't help me.
Am I supposed to feel guilty?

1281
01:27:45,812 --> 01:27:47,230
I don't want you to do anything.

1282
01:27:47,814 --> 01:27:49,941
I need to know the truth
about how you feel.

1283
01:27:49,983 --> 01:27:51,985
You think I want him in here?

1284
01:27:51,985 --> 01:27:54,446
I mean...I don't know.

1285
01:27:54,487 --> 01:27:55,947
I don't know what I feel.
I'm all...

1286
01:27:58,199 --> 01:28:00,285
I feel a little inside out.

1287
01:28:00,327 --> 01:28:02,329
I'm, you know--I don't know.

1288
01:28:02,329 --> 01:28:06,249
There's some things
that...that don't fit.

1289
01:28:06,291 --> 01:28:08,501
Well, that happens.

1290
01:28:09,502 --> 01:28:12,172
You are too damn smart
to be floating around here...

1291
01:28:12,213 --> 01:28:14,633
pretending you don't see
all the holes in this bullshit.

1292
01:28:14,674 --> 01:28:16,593
Hey, listen.
I said I was confused.

1293
01:28:16,635 --> 01:28:18,803
I didn't say
I didn't believe in it.

1294
01:28:18,845 --> 01:28:20,931
All right. That's why
you have to stay open.

1295
01:28:20,972 --> 01:28:23,433
Right now, your anger
is consuming you here.

1296
01:28:23,475 --> 01:28:26,645
Your anger is shutting down
the brain God gave you.

1297
01:28:26,686 --> 01:28:28,688
God. You know, man?
You've been talking about...

1298
01:28:28,730 --> 01:28:30,565
what's going on with me
since I was in high school.

1299
01:28:30,607 --> 01:28:33,443
How the fuck do you know
what's going on inside me?

1300
01:28:33,485 --> 01:28:37,447
No, I know about me.
I know about this place.

1301
01:28:37,489 --> 01:28:39,449
I know about the place
you are in.

1302
01:28:39,491 --> 01:28:42,243
What do you know
about the place I'm in?

1303
01:28:42,285 --> 01:28:44,454
There was a moment...

1304
01:28:44,496 --> 01:28:47,457
when I used to blame
everything and everyone...

1305
01:28:47,499 --> 01:28:49,960
for all
the pain and suffering...

1306
01:28:50,001 --> 01:28:52,128
and vile things
that happened to me...

1307
01:28:52,170 --> 01:28:54,714
that I saw happen to my people.

1308
01:28:54,756 --> 01:28:56,549
Used to blame everybody.

1309
01:28:56,591 --> 01:29:00,136
Blamed white people,
blamed society, blamed God.

1310
01:29:00,178 --> 01:29:03,348
I didn't get no answers 'cause
I asked the wrong questions.

1311
01:29:03,390 --> 01:29:05,892
You have to ask
the right question.

1312
01:29:05,934 --> 01:29:07,185
Like what?

1313
01:29:09,604 --> 01:29:12,524
Has anything you've done
made your life better?

1314
01:29:32,961 --> 01:29:34,462
You gotta help me, man.

1315
01:29:37,257 --> 01:29:38,967
Just help me.

1316
01:29:40,802 --> 01:29:42,846
Get me out of here, you know?

1317
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:48,310
I'm up in four months
for review.

1318
01:29:49,978 --> 01:29:51,980
Put in a word for me.

1319
01:29:52,022 --> 01:29:54,566
I already have. So you're
out there, and then what?

1320
01:29:54,608 --> 01:29:57,444
I don't want to fuck up
my family anymore.

1321
01:29:57,485 --> 01:29:59,738
I'll go as far away
as I can get.

1322
01:29:59,779 --> 01:30:01,573
That's not good enough.

1323
01:30:01,615 --> 01:30:05,035
You want my help,
you gotta do better than that.

1324
01:30:05,076 --> 01:30:07,537
My help is not unconditional.

1325
01:30:07,621 --> 01:30:10,832
Running just ain't good enough.

1326
01:30:43,531 --> 01:30:46,826
Fuck him. Fuck him.

1327
01:30:46,868 --> 01:30:48,578
Fuck him.
Let the niggers have him.

1328
01:30:50,038 --> 01:30:51,373
What's up, D?

1329
01:30:51,414 --> 01:30:54,626
What's all that bullshit
you pulled in the mess hall?

1330
01:30:55,835 --> 01:30:58,713
You out of your fuckin' mind?
Are you fuckin' crazy?

1331
01:30:58,755 --> 01:31:01,049
D, look at me, man!

1332
01:31:01,091 --> 01:31:03,677
You can't make it in here
on your own.

1333
01:31:03,718 --> 01:31:05,804
I'm not afraid of
those fuckin' pussies.

1334
01:31:05,845 --> 01:31:07,973
There was six of them,
and they jumped me.

1335
01:31:08,014 --> 01:31:10,392
That won't happen again.
I hope they fuckin' try.

1336
01:31:10,433 --> 01:31:12,936
Man, I'm not talking
about your peckerwood friends!

1337
01:31:13,019 --> 01:31:15,313
They're protecting
your stupid ass!

1338
01:31:15,355 --> 01:31:19,150
You dissed them in public!
Now you're on your fuckin' own!

1339
01:31:19,192 --> 01:31:21,987
Yo, man, I'm talking about
the brothers, all right?

1340
01:31:22,028 --> 01:31:25,156
They'll fuck you, then
smoke your motherfucking ass!

1341
01:31:25,198 --> 01:31:27,826
Why don't you tell me
something I don't know?

1342
01:31:27,867 --> 01:31:29,995
You think I haven't
thought about that?

1343
01:31:30,036 --> 01:31:33,498
If they come for me, they come.
There ain't nothing I can do.

1344
01:31:34,791 --> 01:31:36,668
What can I do, man?

1345
01:31:41,548 --> 01:31:44,009
So I was right back
where I started.

1346
01:31:44,050 --> 01:31:46,094
Every day
I was sure it was my day.

1347
01:31:47,304 --> 01:31:50,265
Every time
I stepped out of my cell...

1348
01:31:50,307 --> 01:31:53,018
every time
I got in that shower...

1349
01:31:56,104 --> 01:31:58,023
I figured it was
only a matter of time...

1350
01:31:58,064 --> 01:32:00,025
before they made a move.

1351
01:32:01,234 --> 01:32:03,361
I just hoped it'd be quick.

1352
01:32:35,018 --> 01:32:37,354
But it never came.

1353
01:32:39,064 --> 01:32:40,315
I couldn't figure it out.

1354
01:32:40,357 --> 01:32:42,317
I knew some of them
were itching for it.

1355
01:32:42,359 --> 01:32:44,361
After awhile,
I just put my head down...

1356
01:32:44,444 --> 01:32:46,237
and read the stuff
that Sweeney sent me...

1357
01:32:46,279 --> 01:32:48,031
and I kept to myself.

1358
01:32:50,116 --> 01:32:53,745
Last six months in that place,
I was like a ghost.

1359
01:33:07,467 --> 01:33:10,011
What's up, man?
You getting out?

1360
01:33:12,138 --> 01:33:13,932
Come on, man.
What the fuck you waiting on?

1361
01:33:13,974 --> 01:33:16,101
Get the fuck on outta here, man.

1362
01:33:17,978 --> 01:33:20,021
Yeah, you know,
I got this funny feeling.

1363
01:33:20,063 --> 01:33:21,940
Oh, yeah? What's that?

1364
01:33:23,316 --> 01:33:25,068
I'm thinking maybe
the only reason...

1365
01:33:25,110 --> 01:33:26,945
I'm getting out of here
in one piece is you.

1366
01:33:28,488 --> 01:33:29,948
Come on, man!
Get the fuck outta here!

1367
01:33:29,990 --> 01:33:31,992
You think I'm gonna
put my neck on the line...

1368
01:33:31,992 --> 01:33:34,035
for some crazy ass peckerwood?

1369
01:33:34,077 --> 01:33:35,954
Yeah. Right.

1370
01:33:35,996 --> 01:33:38,164
Stupid.

1371
01:33:43,837 --> 01:33:45,505
That's what I thought.

1372
01:33:49,843 --> 01:33:52,095
I owe you, man.

1373
01:33:52,137 --> 01:33:54,306
Man, you don't owe me shit,
all right?

1374
01:33:57,309 --> 01:33:58,268
Yes, I do.

1375
01:34:08,486 --> 01:34:10,447
You'll be outta here in no time.

1376
01:34:10,488 --> 01:34:12,866
Man,
it's a piece of cake, all right?

1377
01:34:15,118 --> 01:34:16,953
Just take it easy
on the brothers, all right?

1378
01:34:16,995 --> 01:34:18,079
The brothers!

1379
01:34:28,506 --> 01:34:29,966
God, man.

1380
01:34:32,510 --> 01:34:34,346
Sorry, Derek.

1381
01:34:35,347 --> 01:34:37,515
Sorry that happened to you.

1382
01:34:38,683 --> 01:34:41,811
Well, I'm not. I'm lucky.

1383
01:34:41,853 --> 01:34:44,814
I feel lucky,
'cause it's wrong, Dan.

1384
01:34:47,192 --> 01:34:48,985
It's wrong,
and it was eating me up.

1385
01:34:49,027 --> 01:34:50,987
It was gonna kill me.

1386
01:34:51,029 --> 01:34:53,031
And I kept asking myself
all the time...

1387
01:34:53,073 --> 01:34:57,035
how did I buy into this shit,
you know?

1388
01:34:58,703 --> 01:35:00,538
It's just 'cause
I was pissed off.

1389
01:35:01,748 --> 01:35:04,960
Nothing I ever did
ever took that feeling away.

1390
01:35:06,503 --> 01:35:09,422
I killed two guys, Danny.
I killed them.

1391
01:35:11,299 --> 01:35:13,468
And it didn't make me
feel any different.

1392
01:35:14,678 --> 01:35:16,012
Just got me more lost...

1393
01:35:16,054 --> 01:35:18,515
and I'm tired of feeling
pissed-off, Danny.

1394
01:35:18,598 --> 01:35:21,518
I'm just tired of it.

1395
01:35:21,559 --> 01:35:23,979
And I'm not telling you
what to do.

1396
01:35:25,313 --> 01:35:26,648
I'm really not.

1397
01:35:27,649 --> 01:35:29,818
But I need you to understand...

1398
01:35:31,653 --> 01:35:34,990
'cause I love you,
and you're my best friend.

1399
01:35:37,117 --> 01:35:38,994
Do you understand?

1400
01:35:39,035 --> 01:35:40,996
Yeah, I understand.

1401
01:35:44,499 --> 01:35:45,834
All right.

1402
01:35:49,838 --> 01:35:51,339
Jesus.

1403
01:36:08,064 --> 01:36:09,941
Hi. Everything OK?

1404
01:36:09,983 --> 01:36:11,359
Ah, everything's great.

1405
01:36:11,401 --> 01:36:14,154
Great. Yeah.
You wanna sleep in our room?

1406
01:36:14,195 --> 01:36:16,156
-No. Thank you.
-You sure?

1407
01:36:16,197 --> 01:36:19,451
Yeah. This is good.
Thank you.

1408
01:36:19,492 --> 01:36:21,953
All right. Come on, let's go.

1409
01:36:43,183 --> 01:36:44,184
Good night.

1410
01:37:51,167 --> 01:37:53,003
I'm gonna take a shower,
all right?

1411
01:38:27,203 --> 01:38:28,455
It's hard to look back...

1412
01:38:28,496 --> 01:38:31,416
and see the truth
about people you love.

1413
01:38:31,458 --> 01:38:34,419
I think if you asked Derek why
it all went the way it did...

1414
01:38:34,461 --> 01:38:36,087
and where it all started...

1415
01:38:36,129 --> 01:38:38,965
he'd still say it started
when our father was murdered.

1416
01:38:40,133 --> 01:38:42,427
The truth is,
it started earlier.

1417
01:38:42,469 --> 01:38:45,680
Are we all meeting
for the game tonight?

1418
01:38:45,722 --> 01:38:46,932
Definitely.

1419
01:38:46,973 --> 01:38:48,600
All right,
Ben's Burger at 7:00...

1420
01:38:48,642 --> 01:38:49,976
then we go watch
the big guy play.

1421
01:38:52,479 --> 01:38:54,439
Psyching up for the game?

1422
01:38:54,481 --> 01:38:57,567
I'm always ready for that.
I got an English exam.

1423
01:38:57,651 --> 01:38:59,945
I'm having a heart attack.
I'm not ready.

1424
01:38:59,986 --> 01:39:01,988
What's the matter?
Afraid you'll get a "B"?

1425
01:39:02,030 --> 01:39:04,950
Might do you good. B-minus.

1426
01:39:04,991 --> 01:39:07,911
Hey, don't laugh.
This guy is different.

1427
01:39:07,953 --> 01:39:10,413
Dr. Sweeney.
This guy's unbelievable.

1428
01:39:10,455 --> 01:39:12,457
Unbelievable. I've never
had a teacher like this.

1429
01:39:12,499 --> 01:39:13,708
He's got two Ph.D.s.

1430
01:39:13,750 --> 01:39:17,379
I don't know what he's doing
teaching at our school.

1431
01:39:17,420 --> 01:39:18,630
What's he got you reading?

1432
01:39:18,672 --> 01:39:22,300
We got this essay exam
on "Native Son."

1433
01:39:22,342 --> 01:39:24,803
"Native Son"?
I don't know that.

1434
01:39:24,844 --> 01:39:26,388
That's a big surprise.

1435
01:39:27,514 --> 01:39:28,890
What? I read.

1436
01:39:30,141 --> 01:39:33,478
Honey, they don't teach
Tom Clancy in school.

1437
01:39:35,146 --> 01:39:36,940
Well, they don't.

1438
01:39:36,982 --> 01:39:38,441
So what is this "Native Son"?

1439
01:39:39,609 --> 01:39:41,987
It's this book
about this black guy.

1440
01:39:42,028 --> 01:39:44,990
We're doing this whole
black literature unit.

1441
01:39:45,031 --> 01:39:47,492
Is it Black History Month?

1442
01:39:47,534 --> 01:39:49,953
No, it's just
this guy Sweeney, you know?

1443
01:39:49,995 --> 01:39:51,830
It's part of the course now.

1444
01:39:58,503 --> 01:40:00,088
What?

1445
01:40:00,130 --> 01:40:02,966
Nothing. It's just...

1446
01:40:03,008 --> 01:40:05,093
It's everywhere I look now.

1447
01:40:05,135 --> 01:40:06,845
What?

1448
01:40:08,513 --> 01:40:11,308
This affirmative blacktion.

1449
01:40:11,349 --> 01:40:16,271
A few new books doesn't qualify
as affirmative black action.

1450
01:40:17,397 --> 01:40:19,190
Read the book,
ace the guy's test.

1451
01:40:19,232 --> 01:40:21,651
Just don't swallow
everything he feeds you whole.

1452
01:40:21,693 --> 01:40:23,236
Just 'cause you see it
on the evening news...

1453
01:40:23,278 --> 01:40:24,404
I know, but what?

1454
01:40:24,446 --> 01:40:26,489
All this stuff about
making everything equal.

1455
01:40:26,531 --> 01:40:27,991
It's not that simple.

1456
01:40:28,033 --> 01:40:29,993
Now you got this book
"Native Son."

1457
01:40:30,035 --> 01:40:31,995
What happened to
the other books in the course?

1458
01:40:32,037 --> 01:40:36,499
They're not any good anymore
because Mr. Two Ph.D. says so?

1459
01:40:36,541 --> 01:40:39,002
Now you gotta trade in
great books for black books?

1460
01:40:39,044 --> 01:40:41,671
Does that make sense?

1461
01:40:41,713 --> 01:40:43,840
You gotta question
these things, Derek.

1462
01:40:43,882 --> 01:40:45,842
You gotta look
at the whole picture.

1463
01:40:45,884 --> 01:40:49,054
We're talking about books here.
I'm also talking about my job.

1464
01:40:49,095 --> 01:40:52,015
I got two black guys
on my squad now...

1465
01:40:52,057 --> 01:40:54,517
who got their job
over a couple of white guys...

1466
01:40:54,559 --> 01:40:56,603
who actually scored higher
on the test.

1467
01:40:56,645 --> 01:41:00,023
Does that make sense?

1468
01:41:00,065 --> 01:41:03,610
Everything's equal now, but I
got two guys watching my back...

1469
01:41:03,652 --> 01:41:07,614
responsible for my life
who aren't as good.

1470
01:41:07,656 --> 01:41:09,449
They only got the job
because they were black...

1471
01:41:09,491 --> 01:41:11,785
not because they were the best.

1472
01:41:11,826 --> 01:41:14,871
-That sucks.
-Is that what America's about?

1473
01:41:14,955 --> 01:41:16,957
No, America's about
best man for the job.

1474
01:41:16,998 --> 01:41:19,125
You do your best,
you get the job.

1475
01:41:19,167 --> 01:41:22,128
This affirmative-action crap...

1476
01:41:22,170 --> 01:41:23,964
I don't know what that's about.

1477
01:41:24,005 --> 01:41:28,134
There's like some hidden agenda
or something going on.

1478
01:41:28,176 --> 01:41:29,636
You see what I'm saying?

1479
01:41:29,678 --> 01:41:32,264
Yeah, I do. I didn't
think about it like that.

1480
01:41:33,807 --> 01:41:35,976
This guy, though--I don't know.

1481
01:41:36,017 --> 01:41:38,103
Dr. Sweeney,
he comes on so strong...

1482
01:41:38,144 --> 01:41:39,980
it's hard
not to listen to him...

1483
01:41:40,021 --> 01:41:42,565
but maybe some of
what he says is kinda...

1484
01:41:42,607 --> 01:41:43,817
It's bullshit.

1485
01:41:45,026 --> 01:41:47,153
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

1486
01:41:47,195 --> 01:41:51,032
No. It's nigger bullshit.

1487
01:41:53,368 --> 01:41:56,121
-You see that, don't you?
-Yeah.

1488
01:41:56,162 --> 01:41:57,998
You gotta watch out for that.

1489
01:41:58,039 --> 01:42:01,001
Yeah. No, I get what
you're saying. I will.

1490
01:42:02,544 --> 01:42:04,462
Good boy.

1491
01:42:04,504 --> 01:42:06,589
I'm proud of you.

1492
01:42:06,673 --> 01:42:08,300
Don't worry about it. I got it.

1493
01:44:13,967 --> 01:44:15,927
And in about one minute...

1494
01:44:15,969 --> 01:44:18,513
I'm gonna watch the sun come up.

1495
01:44:18,555 --> 01:44:20,807
I don't know
if I've ever done that.

1496
01:44:21,975 --> 01:44:25,312
Anyway, we're gonna try to pick
things up and start over.

1497
01:44:25,353 --> 01:44:28,773
It won't be easy,
but we're all together again...

1498
01:44:28,773 --> 01:44:30,900
and I feel good.

1499
01:44:31,985 --> 01:44:34,946
I'm not sure if this paper
is what you wanted--

1500
01:44:34,988 --> 01:44:36,948
if I hit
the social significance...

1501
01:44:36,990 --> 01:44:39,200
or whatever
you're looking for...

1502
01:44:39,242 --> 01:44:42,746
but for what it's worth,
thanks a lot.

1503
01:44:57,260 --> 01:45:01,514
Wow. You look great.
Look at you.

1504
01:45:03,183 --> 01:45:06,144
Yeah. Gotta dress up
for the parole officer.

1505
01:45:06,186 --> 01:45:07,479
Is she cute?

1506
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:09,648
She is a fat guy named Hector...

1507
01:45:09,689 --> 01:45:12,943
-Oh. Well...
-So I'm out of luck.

1508
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:16,947
I just gotta check in...

1509
01:45:16,988 --> 01:45:19,074
then I'm gonna see about
getting my old job back.

1510
01:45:19,115 --> 01:45:21,993
-Great.
-Good morning.

1511
01:45:23,203 --> 01:45:24,454
Davina, can you help?

1512
01:45:24,496 --> 01:45:25,956
Your sister's gonna help you.

1513
01:45:26,998 --> 01:45:28,708
You look great. Knock 'em dead.

1514
01:45:28,750 --> 01:45:30,293
Thanks.

1515
01:45:30,335 --> 01:45:32,754
Come on, sweetie. What would
you like to wear today?

1516
01:45:35,382 --> 01:45:38,593
-You do look good.
-Yeah? I feel silly.

1517
01:45:38,635 --> 01:45:41,012
-You look good.
-Yeah?

1518
01:45:43,014 --> 01:45:44,474
You feel good?

1519
01:45:47,352 --> 01:45:50,480
Yeah. I feel, you know...

1520
01:45:50,522 --> 01:45:52,482
a little...

1521
01:45:52,524 --> 01:45:54,901
I'm getting there.

1522
01:45:56,528 --> 01:45:58,405
Listen...I don't know--

1523
01:46:00,073 --> 01:46:02,367
I don't know
if it's OK that I'm here.

1524
01:46:06,454 --> 01:46:07,706
I want to be here.

1525
01:46:26,474 --> 01:46:28,226
-I'm gonna get a paper.
-Cool.

1526
01:46:45,660 --> 01:46:48,788
-What do you want?
-Maple bar and a large milk.

1527
01:46:48,830 --> 01:46:50,332
All right. I got it.

1528
01:46:54,794 --> 01:46:56,796
Let me get a coffee...

1529
01:46:56,838 --> 01:46:59,466
a maple bar,
and a large milk to go.

1530
01:46:59,507 --> 01:47:00,550
Right away.

1531
01:47:10,602 --> 01:47:13,438
Derek, we need to talk.

1532
01:47:13,480 --> 01:47:14,940
What's going on?

1533
01:47:14,940 --> 01:47:19,402
Cameron Alexander and Seth Ryan
are at the ICU at St. John's.

1534
01:47:19,486 --> 01:47:20,946
They were jumped last night
near Ben's Burgers.

1535
01:47:20,946 --> 01:47:22,781
How bad?

1536
01:47:22,781 --> 01:47:24,449
Well, it looks
like they're gonna live.

1537
01:47:24,491 --> 01:47:27,577
-Then they got lucky.
-Somebody's gotta lose, though.

1538
01:47:30,372 --> 01:47:31,373
What?

1539
01:47:32,624 --> 01:47:35,794
We were kinda hoping maybe
you'd talk to your old crew--

1540
01:47:35,835 --> 01:47:37,420
Come on. No way.

1541
01:47:37,504 --> 01:47:40,632
If there's anybody they're
gonna listen to, it's you.

1542
01:47:40,632 --> 01:47:42,884
No. I hate to tell you,
but I'm out, OK?

1543
01:47:42,926 --> 01:47:44,886
Those guys are probably
gunning for me now.

1544
01:47:44,928 --> 01:47:46,930
We're asking
for your help here, Derek.

1545
01:47:46,972 --> 01:47:48,848
Did you tell him
I was gonna do this?

1546
01:47:55,647 --> 01:47:57,983
This has got nothing
to do with me anymore.

1547
01:47:57,983 --> 01:48:00,986
Yes, it does. It has
everything to do with you.

1548
01:48:00,986 --> 01:48:03,655
God, what are you doing to me?
I'm doing my best!

1549
01:48:03,655 --> 01:48:06,408
I'm going like this just to keep
my family in the clear.

1550
01:48:06,449 --> 01:48:07,867
Don't ask me to fix
this fuckin' situation!

1551
01:48:07,909 --> 01:48:09,869
-I'm not asking that.
-It was there before me.

1552
01:48:09,911 --> 01:48:12,914
You helped create it.
You wanna take a break now?

1553
01:48:12,956 --> 01:48:14,666
You take a break,
you'll find no peace.

1554
01:48:14,708 --> 01:48:17,877
The way to find peace
is to stick.

1555
01:48:17,919 --> 01:48:19,921
It's not gonna make
a fuckin' bit of difference.

1556
01:48:19,963 --> 01:48:23,091
-It might.
-Not a bit.

1557
01:48:23,133 --> 01:48:26,761
I mean, do you know
what you're asking me to do?

1558
01:48:26,803 --> 01:48:29,764
Yes. I'm asking you to do
whatever's in your power to do.

1559
01:48:31,266 --> 01:48:33,560
Oh, man.

1560
01:48:36,313 --> 01:48:37,647
Fuck.

1561
01:48:42,235 --> 01:48:43,653
All right.

1562
01:48:45,488 --> 01:48:48,450
You know what you're gonna do?
Get me shot by white boys.

1563
01:48:48,491 --> 01:48:50,452
I doubt it.

1564
01:48:50,493 --> 01:48:53,538
We're all gonna have a laugh
at that, let me tell ya.

1565
01:48:54,748 --> 01:48:58,209
I'm gonna take him to school.
I'll be back in half an hour.

1566
01:48:58,209 --> 01:48:59,628
Come on.

1567
01:48:59,669 --> 01:49:03,465
Hey, you. You got something
good for me this morning?

1568
01:49:03,506 --> 01:49:04,716
I'll give it to you,
Dr. Sweeney.

1569
01:49:04,758 --> 01:49:06,051
-Yeah, OK.
-All right.

1570
01:49:10,847 --> 01:49:12,849
What's goin' on?

1571
01:49:17,938 --> 01:49:19,105
Come on, let's go.

1572
01:49:34,746 --> 01:49:37,916
It's just so bad for Seth, man.

1573
01:49:37,958 --> 01:49:40,627
I wonder how bad
they got fucked up.

1574
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:44,297
I'm glad they're not dead.
Other than that, I don't care.

1575
01:49:45,799 --> 01:49:47,259
Should we visit them?

1576
01:49:47,300 --> 01:49:49,928
No. Definitely not.

1577
01:49:49,970 --> 01:49:52,013
Just stay out of it.

1578
01:49:52,055 --> 01:49:55,934
Listen. I saw a car cruising
by the house last night...

1579
01:49:55,976 --> 01:49:57,769
when I pulled
out of there with Seth.

1580
01:49:57,811 --> 01:50:00,939
If you get home before me today,
give a look around the street.

1581
01:50:00,981 --> 01:50:03,483
Make sure
there's nothing going on.

1582
01:50:04,484 --> 01:50:06,569
Man, this is bad.

1583
01:50:08,822 --> 01:50:11,783
-They're after you, man.
-It'll cool off.

1584
01:50:11,825 --> 01:50:15,370
If I made it through Chino,
this should be a piece of cake.

1585
01:50:17,664 --> 01:50:18,665
You gonna be OK?

1586
01:50:23,878 --> 01:50:25,005
What are you gonna do?

1587
01:50:25,046 --> 01:50:28,466
I'll work it out.
Keep your head up, all right?

1588
01:50:28,508 --> 01:50:31,886
Things are gonna be fine.
It's gonna be fine.

1589
01:50:31,928 --> 01:50:33,763
Go turn that paper in.

1590
01:50:35,515 --> 01:50:38,685
All right. See ya.

1591
01:50:38,727 --> 01:50:40,020
Come here.

1592
01:50:45,859 --> 01:50:47,319
I'll see you at home.

1593
01:50:49,070 --> 01:50:50,614
All right?

1594
01:50:51,865 --> 01:50:54,451
Yeah, I'll see you.
Good luck, all right?

1595
01:50:54,492 --> 01:50:57,537
-Yeah.
-See you later.

1596
01:51:03,293 --> 01:51:05,712
-Gonna be late.
-We better go.

1597
01:51:06,713 --> 01:51:08,131
All right. Come on.

1598
01:51:31,071 --> 01:51:32,113
Bye.

1599
01:51:32,155 --> 01:51:35,367
I'll catch up with you.
See you later.

1600
01:52:57,115 --> 01:52:58,950
Get out of my way!

1601
01:52:58,992 --> 01:53:00,785
All right! Let him go!

1602
01:53:03,288 --> 01:53:04,414
Oh, no.

1603
01:53:07,542 --> 01:53:09,628
Aw, Jesus.

1604
01:53:33,151 --> 01:53:34,986
Oh, Jesus.

1605
01:53:34,986 --> 01:53:36,988
God, what did I do?

1606
01:54:05,141 --> 01:54:09,104
So I guess this is where
I tell you what I learned.

1607
01:54:09,145 --> 01:54:10,981
My conclusion, right?

1608
01:54:11,982 --> 01:54:15,902
Well, my conclusion is
hate is baggage.

1609
01:54:16,736 --> 01:54:19,948
Life's too short
to be pissed off all the time.

1610
01:54:19,990 --> 01:54:22,158
It's just not worth it.

1611
01:54:24,911 --> 01:54:28,456
Derek says it's always good
to end a paper with a quote.

1612
01:54:28,498 --> 01:54:30,959
He says someone else
has already said it best...

1613
01:54:31,001 --> 01:54:32,961
so if you can't top it...

1614
01:54:33,003 --> 01:54:35,463
steal from them
and go out strong.

1615
01:54:35,505 --> 01:54:38,008
So I picked a guy
I thought you'd like.

1616
01:54:39,843 --> 01:54:43,471
"We are not enemies,
but friends.

1617
01:54:43,513 --> 01:54:45,807
"We must not be enemies.

1618
01:54:45,849 --> 01:54:48,310
"Though passion
may have strained...

1619
01:54:48,351 --> 01:54:51,146
"we must not break
our bonds of affection.

1620
01:54:51,187 --> 01:54:53,982
"The mystic chords of memory...

1621
01:54:54,024 --> 01:54:56,526
"will swell
when again touched...

1622
01:54:56,568 --> 01:54:58,528
"as surely they will be...

1623
01:54:58,570 --> 01:55:01,531
"by the better angels
of our nature."
