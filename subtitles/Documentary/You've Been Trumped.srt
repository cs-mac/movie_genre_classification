1
00:01:08,013 --> 00:01:11,973
I usually get up about
seven and let the cat out.

2
00:01:11,973 --> 00:01:16,373
And, in these dark mornings,
I just nip back to bed again

3
00:01:16,373 --> 00:01:18,133
and turn on the TV,

4
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:20,773
and lie till about,
say, half past seven,

5
00:01:20,773 --> 00:01:23,733
get ready and start my porridge.

6
00:01:24,853 --> 00:01:27,413
Yes, that's for the hens.

7
00:01:27,413 --> 00:01:30,373
Sometimes I keep out...

8
00:01:30,373 --> 00:01:32,733
if I'm going to have
something with tatties,

9
00:01:32,733 --> 00:01:35,133
I keep out a couple for myself.

10
00:01:38,053 --> 00:01:39,173
SHE CHUCKLES

11
00:01:39,173 --> 00:01:40,853
They are very good tatties.

12
00:01:42,173 --> 00:01:43,373
Just nearly there.

13
00:01:48,253 --> 00:01:49,813
COCK CROWS

14
00:01:49,813 --> 00:01:51,133
Before, I used to count.

15
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:55,333
And the fox just nipped off the lot.

16
00:02:00,893 --> 00:02:04,493
RADIO: '..Like to ask a
question with regard to..."

17
00:02:04,493 --> 00:02:06,853
It's all talking on that station.

18
00:02:06,853 --> 00:02:09,813
And the fox thinks there's people about,

19
00:02:09,813 --> 00:02:12,653
because they don't like people.

20
00:02:12,653 --> 00:02:14,133
SHE CHUCKLES

21
00:02:16,853 --> 00:02:18,133
They're just lovely.

22
00:02:19,253 --> 00:02:20,973
They're old ladies.

23
00:02:23,573 --> 00:02:25,533
Got an egg.

24
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:27,053
How many do you get a day?

25
00:02:27,053 --> 00:02:29,613
Oh, well, sometimes two,

26
00:02:29,613 --> 00:02:32,253
sometimes one, sometimes none.

27
00:02:41,053 --> 00:02:43,693
Sure you know, guys, you...

28
00:02:43,693 --> 00:02:45,133
don't rush forward,

29
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:46,733
you'll get all the shots you want.

30
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:49,773
Mr Trump will spend time
with you afterwards as well.

31
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:55,253
If you spread out, guys,
you'll get the best view.

32
00:02:55,253 --> 00:02:56,853
Give my pipers a bit of space.

33
00:02:56,853 --> 00:02:59,053
BAGPIPES START PLAYING

34
00:03:18,853 --> 00:03:20,573
Hello, everybody.

35
00:03:29,613 --> 00:03:32,493
Better believe it. Good.

36
00:03:32,493 --> 00:03:34,613
And everyone knows Martin Hawtree.

37
00:03:34,613 --> 00:03:36,573
He's the architect of the site.

38
00:03:36,573 --> 00:03:38,853
How are you? Nice to see you.

39
00:04:15,573 --> 00:04:21,013
I was born on the farm that
I worked on during the war.

40
00:04:21,013 --> 00:04:23,373
But I wasn't brought up on that farm,

41
00:04:23,373 --> 00:04:26,253
because my father was a lorry driver.

42
00:04:26,253 --> 00:04:28,973
Well, he was actually a
ploughman in his younger day.

43
00:04:30,173 --> 00:04:33,213
There's a ploughing match,
now, my father did ploughing.

44
00:04:33,213 --> 00:04:34,813
That's my father.

45
00:04:37,013 --> 00:04:40,613
He was a prize plougher. My father.

46
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,853
He has lots of cups and medals.

47
00:04:43,853 --> 00:04:46,613
We used to go and watch them.

48
00:04:46,613 --> 00:04:48,693
I know my father's style of ploughing.

49
00:04:48,693 --> 00:04:51,013
See how he is, look.

50
00:04:51,013 --> 00:04:52,693
See, he's over, bent.

51
00:04:56,053 --> 00:04:57,373
This is where we lived.

52
00:04:57,373 --> 00:05:01,653
That's the shop at
Whitecairns, which is no more.

53
00:05:01,653 --> 00:05:03,533
And there's the Daniel's buses.

54
00:05:09,773 --> 00:05:12,573
My eyes aren't as good
as they used to be.

55
00:05:18,773 --> 00:05:22,013
When I was here first,
it was March we saw them.

56
00:05:22,013 --> 00:05:24,813
And then, last year, it was February.

57
00:05:24,813 --> 00:05:28,773
That's two there that
used to come every year.

58
00:05:28,773 --> 00:05:33,413
And we knew it was the same
two because of its long neck.

59
00:05:33,413 --> 00:05:36,333
They are beautiful birds.

60
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,853
CHATTER

61
00:05:40,293 --> 00:05:44,733
..I'm shaking hands with
people and I said, "Whoa."

62
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:46,453
LAUGHTER

63
00:05:48,253 --> 00:05:51,413
Miss Scotland. Come here a minute.

64
00:05:51,413 --> 00:05:54,333
So you won't be going to the
Miss Universe Pageant in...

65
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,613
And who's going, who's going?

66
00:05:56,613 --> 00:05:58,973
- How do you rate her? Good?
- Yeah.

67
00:05:58,973 --> 00:06:00,573
- You think she's good?
- Yeah.

68
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:03,253
I don't know, I'd need to...

69
00:06:03,253 --> 00:06:04,293
SHE LAUGHS

70
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:06,813
Are you from this area?

71
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:14,253
Thank you.

72
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:24,133
BAGPIPES PLAY

73
00:06:46,653 --> 00:06:49,253
There are so many familiar
faces from the press

74
00:06:49,253 --> 00:06:51,973
who've really been amazing
supporters of the project.

75
00:06:51,973 --> 00:06:55,813
This is really a circle of our friends.
This was really a celebration of our friends.

76
00:06:55,813 --> 00:06:59,333
A celebration of people
that supported us.

77
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,053
It was spectacular for me yesterday

78
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:04,533
to be able to walk the final
version of the course with my father,

79
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:07,653
to say, you know, "This
is now what we are doing.

80
00:07:07,653 --> 00:07:11,413
"This is what will be etched
into this land for ever."

81
00:07:11,413 --> 00:07:15,053
As Lord Provost of the city,
yesterday, it was my pleasure

82
00:07:15,053 --> 00:07:18,013
to welcome these two gentlemen.

83
00:07:18,013 --> 00:07:19,853
We look at the plans that you've got

84
00:07:19,853 --> 00:07:24,373
to produce this absolutely
outstanding golf course.

85
00:07:24,373 --> 00:07:28,773
The excitement in this is
absolutely, outstandingly wonderful.

86
00:07:28,773 --> 00:07:30,773
Any questions, gentlemen?

87
00:07:30,773 --> 00:07:32,053
Very nice question.

88
00:07:32,053 --> 00:07:35,653
Mr Trump, what would you say
to the many local residents here

89
00:07:35,653 --> 00:07:40,493
who feel that you've run
roughshod over planning legislation

90
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:44,653
and environmental issues simply
because you've got lots of money?

91
00:07:44,653 --> 00:07:47,693
It's a very interesting question,

92
00:07:47,693 --> 00:07:52,293
because, honestly, this
is a very popular project.

93
00:07:52,293 --> 00:07:54,973
We've had great support from the council

94
00:07:54,973 --> 00:07:57,933
and great support from
the political leaders.

95
00:07:57,933 --> 00:08:01,213
We've saved the dunes, and,
from an environmental standpoint,

96
00:08:01,213 --> 00:08:06,093
it's a much better situation than
it was before we bought the site.

97
00:08:06,093 --> 00:08:08,333
You can sometimes see the deer.

98
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,853
You know, coming out of
these trees across there.

99
00:08:11,853 --> 00:08:15,533
They jump the fence no problem.

100
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:17,093
So beautiful.

101
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:22,893
I know they're wild, but
they're not too scared.

102
00:08:22,893 --> 00:08:27,333
You know, they just
seem to...put up with us.

103
00:08:30,373 --> 00:08:32,253
- Do you want me to face forward maybe?
- Yeah.

104
00:08:32,253 --> 00:08:33,693
Watch this.

105
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:40,493
What was the first thing he said to you?

106
00:08:40,493 --> 00:08:42,533
"Give this man a job," he says.

107
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:44,533
Give this man a job. I
says, "I've got a job."

108
00:08:47,013 --> 00:08:49,973
Then he kept saying it, three times
he said it, "Give this man a job."

109
00:08:49,973 --> 00:08:52,453
I says, "I've got a bloody
job! I don't want a job."

110
00:08:52,453 --> 00:08:53,933
THEY LAUGH

111
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,493
Keep this short, ladies and
gentlemen, the rain's coming.

112
00:08:56,493 --> 00:08:57,653
Give me an umbrella.

113
00:09:02,573 --> 00:09:05,533
No, I'm just, you see, I happen
to be a very truthful person.

114
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:08,333
His property is terribly maintained.

115
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,933
It's slum-like, it's disgusting.

116
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:12,893
He's got stuff thrown
all over the place.

117
00:09:12,893 --> 00:09:15,653
He lives like a pig. And I did say that.

118
00:09:15,653 --> 00:09:17,293
And I'm an honest guy.

119
00:09:17,293 --> 00:09:20,133
And I speak honestly, and I think
that's why some people like me

120
00:09:20,133 --> 00:09:22,133
and some people probably don't like me.

121
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:25,413
But I think he'd do himself a great
service if he fixed up his property.

122
00:09:25,413 --> 00:09:28,613
And I'm not talking money,
it's not a question of money,

123
00:09:28,613 --> 00:09:30,893
it's a question of a
little manual labour.

124
00:09:38,373 --> 00:09:41,213
I says, "That explains everything
on his shed." Just take a look.

125
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:44,053
"He's nothing but a compulsive
liar." That's what I said, aye.

126
00:09:48,973 --> 00:09:51,813
Mr Trump, if you had a message
for Michael Forbes this afternoon,

127
00:09:51,813 --> 00:09:55,333
- what would it be?
- No. I have no message.

128
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,653
- I don't speak to him.
- You quite enjoy it.

129
00:09:57,653 --> 00:10:00,893
And feel that, in the end, your
sort of power and money will win out.

130
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:03,213
No. I don't view it as power and money.

131
00:10:03,213 --> 00:10:05,493
I think that principle will win out.

132
00:10:05,493 --> 00:10:09,813
But my people made deals
with him on two occasions.

133
00:10:09,813 --> 00:10:13,013
My representatives have absolutely
made two deals that he broke.

134
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:15,213
So he knows that.

135
00:10:15,213 --> 00:10:17,973
His people know that,
whoever his people may be.

136
00:10:29,613 --> 00:10:30,933
Oh, well...

137
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:33,053
Nobody's complained
about it up to now, eh?

138
00:10:38,133 --> 00:10:42,053
He passed us this
morning and just flew on

139
00:10:42,053 --> 00:10:45,693
in his top-of-the-range Range
Rover with blacked out windows.

140
00:10:45,693 --> 00:10:49,173
Oh, I missed getting a super photo
of him the first time he arrived here.

141
00:10:49,173 --> 00:10:50,733
The wind got him on the escarpment.

142
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:54,573
And I thought the press would have loved that,
I could have sold that picture for a fortune.

143
00:10:54,573 --> 00:10:56,253
His hair was sticking out like that.

144
00:10:59,373 --> 00:11:01,533
You know, the whole
lacquered thing had come off,

145
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:05,773
where it's all wound around,
and was out to a point.

146
00:11:05,773 --> 00:11:07,213
Damn it.

147
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:13,253
This is my husband's
hat, aboard this boat.

148
00:11:13,253 --> 00:11:16,493
He was chief petty officer on deck.

149
00:11:16,493 --> 00:11:19,613
It's a bit dusty.

150
00:11:24,053 --> 00:11:27,533
There he is, look,
under the red umbrella.

151
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:30,053
Where he is just now,

152
00:11:30,053 --> 00:11:32,413
which is just looking
slightly to the right,

153
00:11:32,413 --> 00:11:35,573
is where he was hoping
to put in the clubhouse.

154
00:11:35,573 --> 00:11:37,853
And where he was going to
put it in, it tends to flood,

155
00:11:37,853 --> 00:11:42,013
because the water all runs
down off the land into there.

156
00:11:42,013 --> 00:11:45,053
So have difficulty
putting a clubhouse there

157
00:11:45,053 --> 00:11:46,613
unless it's on stilts.

158
00:11:50,773 --> 00:11:54,653
My father, he sang songs
that you never hear of today.

159
00:11:54,653 --> 00:11:56,853
And he used to sing a song,

160
00:11:56,853 --> 00:12:00,693
"You'll never miss the water
till the well runs dry."

161
00:12:00,693 --> 00:12:03,133
Which is a very true saying, isn't it?

162
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:21,373
It really shouldn't matter

163
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,973
if the applicant is
Mother Theresa of Calcutta

164
00:12:23,973 --> 00:12:26,133
and she wants to carry
out the development

165
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:28,053
in order to raise
money to help the sick.

166
00:12:28,053 --> 00:12:29,653
Or indeed even if it's Donald Trump.

167
00:12:33,773 --> 00:12:37,773
The permission isn't to the
person, it's to the land.

168
00:12:39,213 --> 00:12:41,013
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

169
00:12:49,293 --> 00:12:52,253
I'd now like to welcome a representative

170
00:12:52,253 --> 00:12:56,333
from the Green Party to the stage
- local councillor Martin Ford.

171
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,573
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

172
00:12:59,973 --> 00:13:02,693
Thank you very much. For
those of you who don't know,

173
00:13:02,693 --> 00:13:04,373
in Aberdeenshire, we have a council

174
00:13:04,373 --> 00:13:06,613
who gives Donald Trump
everything he asks for,

175
00:13:06,613 --> 00:13:07,893
and can't make up their minds

176
00:13:07,893 --> 00:13:11,173
whether to throw people out
of their own homes to help him.

177
00:13:12,533 --> 00:13:14,693
Firstly, I think it's important

178
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:17,253
for people not from the
northeast of Scotland

179
00:13:17,253 --> 00:13:18,933
to have some sense of the build-up.

180
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:27,693
In 2006, I think that was
the first official state visit

181
00:13:27,693 --> 00:13:29,213
by Mr Trump to Scotland.

182
00:13:29,213 --> 00:13:32,493
'His plan is for the Menie
Estate at Balmedie, near Aberdeen.

183
00:13:32,493 --> 00:13:34,693
'On it, he will create two golf courses,

184
00:13:34,693 --> 00:13:36,853
'a 450-bedroom hotel

185
00:13:36,853 --> 00:13:40,213
'and housing, as well as holiday
apartments and golf villas.

186
00:13:40,213 --> 00:13:42,573
'An investment of £1 billion.'

187
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:48,653
'Multimillion-pound golf resort
in Aberdeenshire is rejected.

188
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:51,853
'The chairman of a committee
of Aberdeenshire councillors

189
00:13:51,853 --> 00:13:54,813
'used his casting vote after a
three-hour meeting was deadlocked.'

190
00:13:54,813 --> 00:13:58,853
All the parties had committed
themselves to sustainable development.

191
00:13:58,853 --> 00:14:01,533
And you could apply the tests
of sustainable development

192
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:02,933
to the Trump proposal.

193
00:14:02,933 --> 00:14:05,493
And it failed them. It
failed them in spades.

194
00:14:05,493 --> 00:14:08,013
'The Trump Organization has confirmed

195
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,813
'it will now pull out of Scotland

196
00:14:09,813 --> 00:14:13,013
'after bitter rejection at Balmedie.'

197
00:14:13,013 --> 00:14:14,573
We are very disappointed.

198
00:14:14,573 --> 00:14:17,893
Ultimately, we can go and develop
the project somewhere else.

199
00:14:17,893 --> 00:14:19,253
We'll be fine.

200
00:14:19,253 --> 00:14:21,453
I think it's the people
of Aberdeen and the shire

201
00:14:21,453 --> 00:14:23,733
that were really let down
by their council today.

202
00:14:23,733 --> 00:14:27,533
It was predicated on
long-distance tourism.

203
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,253
It was predicated on people
flying across the Atlantic

204
00:14:30,253 --> 00:14:33,373
to play a few games of golf and
flying back across the Atlantic.

205
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,213
It was predicated on utilising

206
00:14:35,213 --> 00:14:37,853
an irreplaceable and
diminishing resource

207
00:14:37,853 --> 00:14:40,253
of, effectively, natural habitat.

208
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:46,253
'Mr Trump also reiterated
his concern about a proposal

209
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:49,493
'to build an offshore wind
farm close to his site.'

210
00:14:49,493 --> 00:14:51,853
When I look out on to the ocean

211
00:14:51,853 --> 00:14:54,853
from the 18th hole of Trump
International Golf Links,

212
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:57,933
to be honest with you,
I want to see the ocean.

213
00:14:57,933 --> 00:14:59,653
I don't want to see windmills.

214
00:15:02,093 --> 00:15:04,053
Good evening. There's
renewed hope tonight

215
00:15:04,053 --> 00:15:06,293
that American tycoon
Donald Trump's plans

216
00:15:06,293 --> 00:15:09,533
for a £1 billion golf
development in Aberdeenshire

217
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,013
will go ahead.

218
00:15:11,013 --> 00:15:14,133
In a dramatic twist, the
Scottish Government have called in

219
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:16,333
the controversial planning application,

220
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:20,173
taking it out of
Aberdeenshire Council's hands.

221
00:15:20,173 --> 00:15:23,253
'Never before has an application
been called in in this manner...'

222
00:15:23,253 --> 00:15:26,333
By calling in an application
that had already been refused,

223
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,693
it's inescapable that the
government has, in some way,

224
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:32,293
expressed the view that it does
not want the application refused.

225
00:15:37,653 --> 00:15:38,973
'Today, almost two years on

226
00:15:38,973 --> 00:15:41,133
'from when he first
announced his proposals,

227
00:15:41,133 --> 00:15:44,493
'the Scottish Governments have
given the tycoon the green light.'

228
00:15:44,493 --> 00:15:45,933
Well, I think the message would be

229
00:15:45,933 --> 00:15:49,093
I'm going to build for the people
of Scotland the greatest golf course

230
00:15:49,093 --> 00:15:51,413
anywhere in the world,
there'll be nothing like it.

231
00:15:51,413 --> 00:15:54,333
And it's going to be done
environmentally perfect.

232
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,893
'The Menie Estate is in the constituency

233
00:15:56,893 --> 00:15:59,453
'of First Minister, Alex Salmond.'

234
00:15:59,453 --> 00:16:02,253
The balance of opinion among
people in the northeast of Scotland

235
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,693
and among my constituents
is very strongly in favour.

236
00:16:04,693 --> 00:16:07,853
And that's because we can see
the social and economic benefits.

237
00:16:07,853 --> 00:16:09,893
I mean, 6,000 jobs across Scotland.

238
00:16:09,893 --> 00:16:14,133
1,400 local and permanent jobs
here in the northeast of Scotland.

239
00:16:14,133 --> 00:16:16,733
That's a very powerful argument.

240
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:20,413
I think that outweighs
the environmental concerns.

241
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:21,773
There's not many people

242
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:24,933
looking to invest £1 billion
in this local economy.

243
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:27,253
It's right in keeping with
our development strategy

244
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:30,213
that inward-bound tourism is
key for the city and shire.

245
00:16:30,213 --> 00:16:31,773
That's what we're here to support.

246
00:16:31,773 --> 00:16:34,813
And in partnership with Mr Trump,
I believe we can do that together.

247
00:16:34,813 --> 00:16:37,053
I thought it was the biggest
thing that had happened

248
00:16:37,053 --> 00:16:40,213
in the northeast since
oil was discovered.

249
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:45,933
- No, no, CPO!
- ALL: You will be the next to go!

250
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:52,933
Early in 2009, Mr Trump's legal
people approached the council

251
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:55,933
with suggestions as to how they
might justify to councillors

252
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:58,413
the use of compulsory purchase.

253
00:16:58,413 --> 00:17:02,933
'The Trump Organization have asked
the council to consider using CPOs,

254
00:17:02,933 --> 00:17:05,733
'and councillors decided
it was inappropriate

255
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,973
'to reject the use of
compulsory purchase orders

256
00:17:07,973 --> 00:17:09,853
'without a full report.'

257
00:17:09,853 --> 00:17:12,373
It leaves a big cloud over
our heads, that's all it does.

258
00:17:12,373 --> 00:17:14,853
Disappointment mixed with
fury, to be quite honest.

259
00:17:14,853 --> 00:17:18,973
This is an action of people with
no conscience and no willpower.

260
00:17:18,973 --> 00:17:21,333
This is typical of the
sort of thing that we get.

261
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,773
Oh, it's very typical.

262
00:17:22,773 --> 00:17:25,253
It's very typical for
councillors like yourself

263
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:29,453
to defer decisions that are
critical to people's livelihoods.

264
00:17:29,453 --> 00:17:31,893
And you failed. You failed.

265
00:17:31,893 --> 00:17:34,253
'I am thrilled with the outcome.

266
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:38,213
'They continue to diminish the
importance and nonsensical motions

267
00:17:38,213 --> 00:17:40,453
'put forth by Mr Ford,

268
00:17:40,453 --> 00:17:42,813
'and, hopefully, these
will be the last few minutes

269
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:44,093
'of his political career.

270
00:17:44,093 --> 00:17:45,293
'Because I think he's blown

271
00:17:45,293 --> 00:17:47,333
'virtually everything
he's ever touched.'

272
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:51,093
Since that time, the residents at Menie,

273
00:17:51,093 --> 00:17:52,973
in their own homes,

274
00:17:52,973 --> 00:17:56,413
have been living with the
threat of the possibility

275
00:17:56,413 --> 00:18:01,013
that they would be forced to
leave them against their will.

276
00:18:04,573 --> 00:18:09,173
- Just bang the window.
- Jesus, how do you do business with someone who doesn't have a door?

277
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:11,053
I look at his place, and it's a pigsty.

278
00:18:11,053 --> 00:18:13,253
Do I regret that? No, I
don't regret, it's a pigsty.

279
00:18:13,253 --> 00:18:15,373
It turns out, actually,
we've got a collection

280
00:18:15,373 --> 00:18:17,013
of remarkable principled people,

281
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,653
who have recognised what's
right and what's wrong.

282
00:18:19,653 --> 00:18:21,653
And have said they are
not standing for wrong.

283
00:18:21,653 --> 00:18:23,813
Ben,

284
00:18:23,813 --> 00:18:25,733
what we wanted to ask you...

285
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:30,093
Have you ever thought about moving?

286
00:18:31,373 --> 00:18:32,613
Um... No.

287
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:35,533
You see, the thing is, I'm
still working the place myself.

288
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:37,133
It's my living.

289
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:45,013
All my relations have been
salmon fishing all their lives.

290
00:18:49,093 --> 00:18:52,533
My great-grandfather, my
grandfather, my father, all my uncles,

291
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:54,053
they're all salmon fishers.

292
00:18:54,053 --> 00:18:58,493
It's just in the blood, you
know, you just have to do it.

293
00:18:58,493 --> 00:19:01,333
I was 14 and half, I went
down to fish with my uncle

294
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,493
when I left school.

295
00:19:03,493 --> 00:19:05,813
I worked with him for a few years

296
00:19:05,813 --> 00:19:07,573
and I went trawling.

297
00:19:07,573 --> 00:19:09,453
Everybody knew everybody, you know.

298
00:19:09,453 --> 00:19:12,133
All the salmon fishers knew
everybody. It was great.

299
00:19:20,573 --> 00:19:22,693
It was cotton nets back then.

300
00:19:22,693 --> 00:19:25,253
They rotted quick, so they
had to make a lot of nets.

301
00:19:25,253 --> 00:19:27,893
These new ones, they're
made of plastic, polythene,

302
00:19:27,893 --> 00:19:30,693
they last a lot longer and
they are lighter, you know.

303
00:19:30,693 --> 00:19:33,973
So you needed a full crew to
work the old nets, you know.

304
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,653
This boat this size
here, you'd have needed

305
00:19:37,653 --> 00:19:40,693
probably six, six men to
pull one of these nets up.

306
00:19:40,693 --> 00:19:43,133
Now you can do it with two, you know.

307
00:20:10,413 --> 00:20:12,693
Still am, I still am fishing.

308
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,773
I haven't done it for
the last couple of years,

309
00:20:15,773 --> 00:20:17,813
because I've been bothered by my back.

310
00:20:17,813 --> 00:20:20,173
But I'll get going again next year.

311
00:20:25,293 --> 00:20:27,453
I have to tow my boat down to the beach.

312
00:20:27,453 --> 00:20:29,573
It's not like here you
come out of a harbour.

313
00:20:29,573 --> 00:20:31,453
I have to launch it off the beach.

314
00:20:31,453 --> 00:20:35,653
Well, I have nets on the
beach, stake nets, you know,

315
00:20:35,653 --> 00:20:39,493
and I'll be towing anchors through his golf
course as well, because that's how we do it.

316
00:20:39,493 --> 00:20:42,453
We just tow the anchors, we don't
lift them onto trailers and things.

317
00:20:44,013 --> 00:20:45,573
I'm looking forward to it.

318
00:20:45,573 --> 00:20:47,413
HE CHUCKLES

319
00:20:49,573 --> 00:20:52,973
A lot of local people don't see
Michael as a particular problem.

320
00:20:52,973 --> 00:20:54,893
They see him as someone

321
00:20:54,893 --> 00:20:57,573
who is standing up for
what is rightfully his.

322
00:20:57,573 --> 00:21:00,173
And they don't believe all the claptrap

323
00:21:00,173 --> 00:21:06,493
that Trump's PR machine put
out about a hard-nosed farmer.

324
00:21:10,053 --> 00:21:13,093
You know, he's standing
up for what's his.

325
00:21:13,093 --> 00:21:16,133
Why shouldn't he? Why
wouldn't he? You know.

326
00:21:17,573 --> 00:21:20,253
This is, actually,
zoned for the housing.

327
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:25,053
On the crest of that hill, between
David Milne's property there,

328
00:21:25,053 --> 00:21:32,813
is going to be the eight-storey
blocks of time-share apartments.

329
00:21:32,813 --> 00:21:37,453
My house, originally a
coastguard station, built in 1954,

330
00:21:37,453 --> 00:21:40,973
but there's been a station
here since about 1860 something.

331
00:21:40,973 --> 00:21:43,893
There's a row of five
cottages, here to my right.

332
00:21:43,893 --> 00:21:46,133
They are coastguard cottages.

333
00:21:46,133 --> 00:21:49,493
The occupants were originally
workers in the coastguard.

334
00:21:51,693 --> 00:21:53,653
So if, when you look at the drawings,

335
00:21:53,653 --> 00:21:56,493
you see something that looks
like a crashed space shuttle...

336
00:21:58,933 --> 00:22:00,413
..that's the hotel.

337
00:22:03,173 --> 00:22:05,573
And where my home is, is
meant to be a car park.

338
00:22:07,973 --> 00:22:10,573
The buildings that you see,
just a little further over there,

339
00:22:10,573 --> 00:22:13,973
the other side of the green
field, that's Mike Forbes' place.

340
00:22:13,973 --> 00:22:16,413
Again, under threat
of compulsory purchase.

341
00:22:16,413 --> 00:22:18,493
Down below here, this white building,

342
00:22:18,493 --> 00:22:20,573
that's the home of the Munro family.

343
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:23,253
Again, under compulsory purchase threat.

344
00:22:23,253 --> 00:22:26,373
"No compulsory purchase,
no more Trump lies,"

345
00:22:26,373 --> 00:22:28,853
on the top of the postcard.

346
00:22:28,853 --> 00:22:32,373
"The hoose down the road to the dunes

347
00:22:32,373 --> 00:22:34,533
"where once you could roam free."

348
00:22:42,293 --> 00:22:46,493
'I've been here a long time, near
on three decades, that's a long time.

349
00:22:46,493 --> 00:22:48,653
'Most of my adult life has
been spent in this house.

350
00:22:48,653 --> 00:22:51,733
'I've brought my family up
here. Findlay was born here.'

351
00:22:51,733 --> 00:22:55,373
Here he is. Hi, pet.

352
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,773
'And then, this man,
this foreigner comes in,'

353
00:22:57,773 --> 00:23:01,013
and because he's got a few
pounds, they reckon, in his pocket,

354
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:05,573
a bit of a name, and we're just
cast aside, we're in the way.

355
00:23:05,573 --> 00:23:09,413
I think it's an awful
way to treat people.

356
00:23:09,413 --> 00:23:12,933
That was just when we moved
here, I was expecting Findlay -

357
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,373
he was, as I say, born here, so...

358
00:23:14,373 --> 00:23:16,613
As you can see, the
difference from a few years.

359
00:23:16,613 --> 00:23:21,173
This was taken in
excess of 25 years ago.

360
00:23:21,173 --> 00:23:24,693
Me with the children
and my mother, paddling.

361
00:23:24,693 --> 00:23:26,493
Oh, it was just glorious.

362
00:23:28,773 --> 00:23:32,333
You realise what you've got and
what's going to be taken away.

363
00:23:34,573 --> 00:23:36,253
Are you going to Cruden Bay?

364
00:23:36,253 --> 00:23:39,293
Maybe I should take a
cruise up in the old Zodie.

365
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:44,053
MUSIC: "Janie Jones" by The Clash

366
00:23:46,373 --> 00:23:49,653
Well, I'd just left art college in 1974.

367
00:23:49,653 --> 00:23:54,173
And I moved to London. It's
where I continued my relationship

368
00:23:54,173 --> 00:23:56,933
with, at that time, John Mellor,

369
00:23:56,933 --> 00:23:59,053
who most people know as Joe Strummer.

370
00:24:00,293 --> 00:24:05,453
Having extricated myself
from the music industry,

371
00:24:05,453 --> 00:24:09,013
I chanced to meet Kim, my partner.

372
00:24:10,413 --> 00:24:13,933
It must have been worse yesterday,
because the winds were terrific yesterday.

373
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:19,613
It's a bit rough today, isn't it? So
you are taking it out of the water, then?

374
00:24:22,853 --> 00:24:25,333
I used to come up here
with my grandmother

375
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:27,013
and my aunt and my cousins,

376
00:24:27,013 --> 00:24:30,133
on the bus from
Aberdeen, in the mid '50s,

377
00:24:30,133 --> 00:24:34,733
with our bandy catchers, and
playing commandos on those dunes.

378
00:24:34,733 --> 00:24:36,493
It was a fantastic open space

379
00:24:36,493 --> 00:24:40,773
within reach of ordinary
people from Aberdeen.

380
00:24:40,773 --> 00:24:46,133
And the only wild stretch has been
swallowed up by this development.

381
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:54,133
Now, that is primarily what drives
me to say it shouldn't happen.

382
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:17,253
It's a real mosaic of habitats.

383
00:25:17,253 --> 00:25:21,373
You've got everything from open
sand to shrubs to trees to wetlands.

384
00:25:21,373 --> 00:25:24,333
A greener Scotland is effectively a myth

385
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:26,293
if something like this
is allowed to happen.

386
00:25:26,293 --> 00:25:29,613
And lots of areas are either
destroyed, moved around,

387
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:31,173
sanitised, disturbed,

388
00:25:31,173 --> 00:25:33,893
and they'll be a few bits
left scattered around as a kind

389
00:25:33,893 --> 00:25:36,133
of mitigation of this development,

390
00:25:36,133 --> 00:25:39,133
this very damaging
two-golf-course development,

391
00:25:39,133 --> 00:25:41,973
and the whole package is wrong.

392
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:05,973
Welcome to our little world, McIntyre.

393
00:26:05,973 --> 00:26:07,853
This is a bay in a million.

394
00:26:07,853 --> 00:26:12,973
And this harbour is a natural for
blasting in the underground tanks.

395
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,733
Incredibly steep, isn't it?

396
00:26:22,933 --> 00:26:26,373
These sorts of models give
us vital clues to understand

397
00:26:26,373 --> 00:26:29,253
the interaction of waves on beaches,

398
00:26:29,253 --> 00:26:31,813
the interaction of the
beach and the upper beach.

399
00:26:31,813 --> 00:26:34,773
And then, the availability of sand
to be blown into sand dune systems,

400
00:26:34,773 --> 00:26:36,853
such as we've got on
the Aberdeenshire coast.

401
00:26:38,773 --> 00:26:42,693
In Menie, what we've got
is a very, very clear model

402
00:26:42,693 --> 00:26:46,573
of sand moving in a northerly
direction. Crystal clear.

403
00:26:46,573 --> 00:26:49,453
That is very interesting from
the point of view of science,

404
00:26:49,453 --> 00:26:51,293
from the point of view of understanding

405
00:26:51,293 --> 00:26:53,613
how our landscapes
adjusts to climate change.

406
00:26:55,133 --> 00:26:56,373
It is the only one left.

407
00:26:56,373 --> 00:26:58,173
And once we've lost the only one left,

408
00:26:58,173 --> 00:27:00,533
we are dealing with
essentially artificial systems.

409
00:27:00,533 --> 00:27:02,813
And the problem with
artificial systems, of course,

410
00:27:02,813 --> 00:27:05,213
is that, because we've
meddled with them in some way,

411
00:27:05,213 --> 00:27:07,573
we don't actually know what
the forward track might be.

412
00:27:07,573 --> 00:27:10,813
These are tees that are built

413
00:27:10,813 --> 00:27:12,413
onto very steep sand dunes.

414
00:27:12,413 --> 00:27:15,333
So they will have to
be built up artificially

415
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:18,053
by movement of sand from
elsewhere on the site.

416
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:21,773
Up to eight metres vertically
will have to be emplaced.

417
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:26,693
And that will involve moving
biblical amounts of sand from A to B.

418
00:27:26,693 --> 00:27:30,453
So not only do you lose
the natural dynamism

419
00:27:30,453 --> 00:27:33,413
that this area is noted
for scientifically,

420
00:27:33,413 --> 00:27:36,893
you will stabilise it, so
you'll lose the dynamism.

421
00:27:36,893 --> 00:27:41,693
But also, you will be constructing a
largely artificial sand dune environment.

422
00:27:43,933 --> 00:27:45,653
Well, I've stabilised the dunes,

423
00:27:45,653 --> 00:27:48,293
and that means the dunes
will be with us for ever.

424
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:51,213
And that's good, because dunes
can be gone with the wind.

425
00:27:51,213 --> 00:27:53,773
I mean, dunes can move and
shift and sometimes they do.

426
00:27:53,773 --> 00:27:56,173
But when you stabilise them,
they're with you for ever.

427
00:27:56,173 --> 00:27:58,613
So I've stabilised
them, and, ultimately,

428
00:27:58,613 --> 00:28:01,013
I think that's going
to be a great factor

429
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:03,973
and a great thing for
Scotland and for Aberdeen.

430
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:07,733
These wilderness environments
are our equivalent, if you like,

431
00:28:07,733 --> 00:28:11,693
of the Amazon rainforest or
the swamps in South America.

432
00:28:11,693 --> 00:28:16,413
Many of these wilderness environments
have been lost around the world,

433
00:28:16,413 --> 00:28:19,933
and, in Britain, we've got
very, very few of those left.

434
00:28:19,933 --> 00:28:22,973
And what's happening here is
that we are losing yet another.

435
00:28:22,973 --> 00:28:26,333
We've had tremendous support
from the environmental groups,

436
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:28,413
so I'm very happy about that.

437
00:28:28,413 --> 00:28:31,013
I mean, we've had great,
great environmental support.

438
00:28:31,013 --> 00:28:33,653
I've received many environmental
awards over the years.

439
00:28:33,653 --> 00:28:36,333
I think the greatest thing I've
ever done for the environment

440
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:39,333
is what I'll be doing
right here in Aberdeen.

441
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:41,213
But when we went to our meetings,

442
00:28:41,213 --> 00:28:42,813
we had tremendous support

443
00:28:42,813 --> 00:28:46,173
from major environmentalists
and environmental groups.

444
00:28:46,173 --> 00:28:48,453
Is my hair OK? It's blowing all over.

445
00:28:48,453 --> 00:28:49,653
Have a look in the lens.

446
00:28:49,653 --> 00:28:52,293
I can't see it. Do you have a
mirror, Emily? Give me a mirror.

447
00:28:52,293 --> 00:28:54,933
'There are no environmental
organisations that I know of

448
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,413
'that favour this development.'

449
00:28:56,413 --> 00:28:57,813
Who has a mirror?

450
00:28:57,813 --> 00:28:59,933
RSPB opposed it.

451
00:28:59,933 --> 00:29:03,493
SEPA, the Scottish
Environmental Protection Agency,

452
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:06,893
Scottish Natural Heritage were
violently opposed to this development.

453
00:29:06,893 --> 00:29:10,253
The World Wildlife Trust
were against the development.

454
00:29:10,253 --> 00:29:12,853
The Ramblers Association
were against the development.

455
00:29:12,853 --> 00:29:16,853
I know of no credible
environmental organisations

456
00:29:16,853 --> 00:29:20,133
that favoured such a development
on environmental grounds.

457
00:29:28,053 --> 00:29:31,493
This is an accolade site. A Site
Of Special Scientific Interest.

458
00:29:31,493 --> 00:29:36,853
The highest conservation accolade
that this country can bestow.

459
00:29:36,853 --> 00:29:40,493
And yet, we allow a golf
course to be developed on it,

460
00:29:40,493 --> 00:29:43,893
which will remove the
scientific interest completely.

461
00:29:43,893 --> 00:29:46,333
And it's something of a personal tragedy

462
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:49,453
and great sadness across
the scientific community.

463
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:22,933
It is alarming!

464
00:30:22,933 --> 00:30:26,173
Well, look what security
did to me a long time ago -

465
00:30:26,173 --> 00:30:31,573
came out of nowhere, stopped my car,
hands on bonnet, and I got a scare.

466
00:30:34,213 --> 00:30:37,853
They're saying that's for the lorries,

467
00:30:37,853 --> 00:30:41,133
that cars and pick-ups and
everything can still use our road.

468
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:44,053
Look, we've got a gap
in the trees already.

469
00:30:44,053 --> 00:30:47,933
Well, those trees are seemingly coming
down, which they shouldn't be taking down.

470
00:30:47,933 --> 00:30:49,693
They're targeting Mike Forbes.

471
00:30:49,693 --> 00:30:53,173
That's where their spring
is, up in these trees.

472
00:30:53,173 --> 00:30:56,493
Mike, you are going to have
problems with your water.

473
00:30:56,493 --> 00:31:00,773
I'm really horrified to see
this bank. I mean, what is it?

474
00:31:02,853 --> 00:31:05,973
I think it's a road, and that
these trees are coming down.

475
00:31:07,453 --> 00:31:11,053
This is absolutely horrendous.

476
00:31:11,053 --> 00:31:13,293
That will be the end of the spring.

477
00:31:35,973 --> 00:31:37,973
Who are you with?

478
00:31:37,973 --> 00:31:39,493
I'm a freelance.

479
00:31:39,493 --> 00:31:41,173
As all the rest of the press,

480
00:31:41,173 --> 00:31:43,653
anyone who comes in
here, would have the...

481
00:31:43,653 --> 00:31:45,853
Do you want to turn that
off or to leave it on or...?

482
00:31:45,853 --> 00:31:47,413
I'll just leave it on, yeah.

483
00:31:47,413 --> 00:31:49,133
As I'm sure you are well aware,

484
00:31:49,133 --> 00:31:50,773
we've had a lot of damage here.

485
00:31:50,773 --> 00:31:52,053
If I was causing damage...

486
00:31:52,053 --> 00:31:54,013
No, no! I'm only putting
you in the picture.

487
00:31:54,013 --> 00:31:57,573
You know, I'm just basically
overlooking from this bank.

488
00:31:57,573 --> 00:32:00,413
Shouldn't be any health and safety
considerations, should there?

489
00:32:00,413 --> 00:32:01,973
No, no, no, no, there isn't.

490
00:32:01,973 --> 00:32:04,653
But again, I would ask you to
announce yourself to the site.

491
00:32:04,653 --> 00:32:06,093
It's the wish of the clients.

492
00:32:06,093 --> 00:32:08,573
If you wish to film on site,
we've no issue with it at all.

493
00:32:08,573 --> 00:32:10,333
You know, there's no problem.

494
00:32:12,613 --> 00:32:14,013
Sorry?

495
00:32:14,013 --> 00:32:15,333
I'm just freelance, yeah.

496
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:21,973
Hi, there.

497
00:32:23,413 --> 00:32:25,253
Hello. What you doing down here?

498
00:32:25,253 --> 00:32:26,453
Just doing a bit of filming.

499
00:32:26,453 --> 00:32:28,653
If you're freelance, are
you filming for yourself?

500
00:32:28,653 --> 00:32:30,053
Yeah. Just filming for myself.

501
00:32:30,053 --> 00:32:32,853
- There's a lot of publicity going on about this area just now.
- Yeah.

502
00:32:32,853 --> 00:32:35,853
And a lot of this area down here
is now classed as a work site.

503
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:37,013
Yeah.

504
00:32:37,013 --> 00:32:38,813
So for health and safety reasons,

505
00:32:38,813 --> 00:32:42,253
you should really be
contacting the department.

506
00:32:42,253 --> 00:32:46,293
- This is estate land...
- Right. But I thought, there's not a sort of

507
00:32:46,293 --> 00:32:48,293
right to roam, is
there not, in Scotland.

508
00:32:48,293 --> 00:32:50,013
There is, but not within vehicles.

509
00:32:50,013 --> 00:32:51,533
But I wasn't in a vehicle, though.

510
00:32:51,533 --> 00:32:53,053
But again...

511
00:32:53,053 --> 00:32:55,813
Excuse me one second, could you
switch your camera off, please?

512
00:32:55,813 --> 00:32:59,613
But, of course, you can't
cut across the dunes now,

513
00:32:59,613 --> 00:33:01,533
because they've built this road.

514
00:33:01,533 --> 00:33:03,133
That's the road they've built,

515
00:33:03,133 --> 00:33:07,133
they've laid those across
the natural drainage,

516
00:33:07,133 --> 00:33:09,573
so they're trapping
water all over the place.

517
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:11,013
Look, look at that.

518
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,013
It goes up and down with
the tide, all this lot.

519
00:33:20,653 --> 00:33:23,133
- Oh, hello.
- Hello, how are you?

520
00:33:23,133 --> 00:33:25,373
It's terrific, that water.

521
00:33:25,373 --> 00:33:28,533
Yes, well, they've virtually dammed
us and they've put in that road.

522
00:33:28,533 --> 00:33:31,653
Mike's concern is, where
are they going to pump it to?

523
00:33:33,293 --> 00:33:35,693
Trees suck up water, that's
why the trees are planted.

524
00:33:35,693 --> 00:33:38,213
Now they've taken the trees
away and buried them in a hole.

525
00:33:38,213 --> 00:33:41,693
Took 'em away and buried them in a hole.
They dug a big hole over the back there.

526
00:33:46,853 --> 00:33:50,733
They took all the trees and put
them in a hole and buried them.

527
00:33:50,733 --> 00:33:52,533
HE CHUCKLES

528
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:54,053
According to my neighbour,

529
00:33:54,053 --> 00:33:57,573
he says it was 400 trees
they buried over there.

530
00:34:01,653 --> 00:34:02,893
Oh, me.

531
00:34:02,893 --> 00:34:06,773
Marram grass being stripped into blocks

532
00:34:06,773 --> 00:34:09,093
and taken away in huge dumpers.

533
00:34:09,093 --> 00:34:13,133
And as you can see from
the last time we were here,

534
00:34:13,133 --> 00:34:16,413
there's been vast
quantity of sand taken.

535
00:34:16,413 --> 00:34:18,093
I just can't believe it.

536
00:34:18,093 --> 00:34:21,093
Be interesting to see where
all this sand is coming from.

537
00:34:22,413 --> 00:34:24,493
That's the sand dunes that's driving it.

538
00:34:24,493 --> 00:34:28,493
It's the sand dunes from over
there they are putting on over here.

539
00:34:28,493 --> 00:34:30,933
I didn't think they
were allowed to move 'em.

540
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,733
That should be on now. Yeah, that's it.

541
00:34:34,733 --> 00:34:36,893
And then, you just press
that, that button there.

542
00:34:36,893 --> 00:34:38,133
Yeah, the one on the right.

543
00:34:38,133 --> 00:34:41,733
- Yeah.
- So I'm filming...all this.

544
00:34:52,093 --> 00:34:53,373
To come here every day,

545
00:34:53,373 --> 00:34:57,413
you really get an idea of the
destruction that's happening.

546
00:34:57,413 --> 00:35:01,053
Also notice there doesn't
seem to be anybody coming down,

547
00:35:01,053 --> 00:35:02,733
checking on anything.

548
00:35:04,373 --> 00:35:05,933
There's nae naebody.

549
00:35:05,933 --> 00:35:08,533
You never see a...the only
person you ever see is security,

550
00:35:08,533 --> 00:35:10,933
keeping...keeping people away, really.

551
00:35:45,013 --> 00:35:46,733
I look at Mr Forbes

552
00:35:46,733 --> 00:35:49,613
and his disgusting
conditions in which he lives.

553
00:35:49,613 --> 00:35:51,853
And that people have to look at that.

554
00:35:51,853 --> 00:35:54,093
And it's about time
that somebody spoke up.

555
00:35:54,093 --> 00:35:57,333
It's almost like, in fact, it
is like a slum-like condition.

556
00:35:57,333 --> 00:36:03,053
For people to have to look at
this virtual slum is a disgrace.

557
00:36:03,053 --> 00:36:09,213
Mr Forbes is not a man that people
in Scotland should be proud of.

558
00:36:10,733 --> 00:36:14,893
Mr Forbes is not a respected man
among the people that he lives with.

559
00:36:14,893 --> 00:36:17,493
I mean, people have come up to
us, they've written us notes,

560
00:36:17,493 --> 00:36:20,973
they've written us letters, that
this guy is all sorts of things.

561
00:36:20,973 --> 00:36:23,093
And I won't say it. They're saying it.

562
00:36:23,093 --> 00:36:27,933
Mr Forbes lives in a pig-like
atmosphere. It's disgusting.

563
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:34,293
They are really lovely, genuine,
honest, authentic people.

564
00:36:37,053 --> 00:36:38,933
And they are really sincere people.

565
00:36:38,933 --> 00:36:44,893
And, yeah, an absolute pleasure to
be involved in a project with them.

566
00:36:44,893 --> 00:36:47,853
David McCue, he's an artist.

567
00:36:47,853 --> 00:36:49,893
And he got in touch with me,

568
00:36:49,893 --> 00:36:53,053
asking me if it would be OK
if he did an art exhibition.

569
00:36:53,053 --> 00:36:55,213
I said, "Yeah, if you like, yeah."

570
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,693
So we were going to do it
in a marquee tent out here.

571
00:36:57,693 --> 00:37:00,133
But he wasn't for that. He had
to have it in that shed there.

572
00:37:00,133 --> 00:37:02,413
Why, I don't know, but he
had to have it in that shed.

573
00:37:02,413 --> 00:37:04,173
HE CHUCKLES

574
00:37:04,173 --> 00:37:06,533
The worst shed I've got, and
he had to have it in that.

575
00:37:07,248 --> 00:37:10,808
I think we'll just stick
with that for just now.

576
00:37:10,808 --> 00:37:12,688
I think if we put all four up...

577
00:37:20,048 --> 00:37:21,488
I love the barn,

578
00:37:21,488 --> 00:37:26,088
because the minute you started
to change and put things in there,

579
00:37:26,088 --> 00:37:28,928
it kind of recontextualised the work

580
00:37:28,928 --> 00:37:31,488
in exactly the way I hoped it would do.

581
00:37:35,448 --> 00:37:38,008
It was great meeting
Michael's wife, Sheila.

582
00:37:38,008 --> 00:37:40,888
Seriously, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

583
00:37:40,888 --> 00:37:44,248
She's really feisty and
has a great sense of humour,

584
00:37:44,248 --> 00:37:47,128
a great sense of who she
is, her own kind of identity.

585
00:37:47,128 --> 00:37:51,008
Sheila chooses to sometimes
be out of the limelight,

586
00:37:51,008 --> 00:37:55,008
but other times, I think it's
important to hear her voice too.

587
00:37:55,008 --> 00:37:57,088
The drawing represents...

588
00:37:57,088 --> 00:38:00,168
as a metaphor for, "Behind
every successful man,

589
00:38:00,168 --> 00:38:02,088
"there's a strong woman."

590
00:38:11,328 --> 00:38:15,608
I really wanted to find for
myself what the truth was,

591
00:38:15,608 --> 00:38:18,128
at what was happening at that site.

592
00:38:18,128 --> 00:38:21,008
Like the security
presence, for instance.

593
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:24,808
And that is really stressful
for Sheila and Michael,

594
00:38:24,808 --> 00:38:26,248
and Molly as well.

595
00:38:26,248 --> 00:38:27,688
You know, that's their homes.

596
00:38:27,688 --> 00:38:30,928
And there would just be a vehicle
that would circle their land

597
00:38:30,928 --> 00:38:34,248
and stop, pause and then move off again.

598
00:38:34,248 --> 00:38:36,168
But it's intimidating.

599
00:38:36,168 --> 00:38:40,488
And I certainly felt like
that the week that I was there.

600
00:38:43,648 --> 00:38:48,608
This one, for me, was very much
the very typical Trump stance

601
00:38:48,608 --> 00:38:50,728
and pose that he does very often.

602
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:52,528
It's almost like a trademark,

603
00:38:52,528 --> 00:38:54,968
the way he gestures
and his body language.

604
00:38:54,968 --> 00:38:58,208
Obviously, referenced
Warhol quite considerably

605
00:38:58,208 --> 00:39:00,688
with the repeat pattern
of the dollar sign,

606
00:39:00,688 --> 00:39:02,528
that's like a brick wall -

607
00:39:02,528 --> 00:39:05,008
you've hit a brick wall, dead end,

608
00:39:05,008 --> 00:39:06,688
kind of scenario.

609
00:39:11,368 --> 00:39:14,128
The media has been
coming down to this place,

610
00:39:14,128 --> 00:39:18,248
it's been talking about it as a
slum, which it certainly isn't.

611
00:39:18,248 --> 00:39:22,328
And to be able to sort of show
off the interior of that barn,

612
00:39:22,328 --> 00:39:24,728
which we've always just
seen the exterior of,

613
00:39:24,728 --> 00:39:28,608
and get a real glimpse into the
history, the heritage of the space.

614
00:39:30,128 --> 00:39:32,728
I glimpse out of the back square

615
00:39:32,728 --> 00:39:35,968
that looks onto all of
the other properties,

616
00:39:35,968 --> 00:39:38,328
which are in a similar position

617
00:39:38,328 --> 00:39:41,728
of maybe coming under
compulsory purchase.

618
00:39:43,608 --> 00:39:46,368
It was just...it was perfect.

619
00:39:50,048 --> 00:39:51,488
20 turns up, I'll be happy.

620
00:39:51,488 --> 00:39:53,208
HE LAUGHS

621
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:10,248
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

622
00:40:10,248 --> 00:40:11,608
HE LAUGHS

623
00:40:11,608 --> 00:40:14,488
It's in grossly bad taste,

624
00:40:14,488 --> 00:40:17,808
which, of course, is spot on. Yes.

625
00:40:17,808 --> 00:40:20,248
We all need a hockey
stick or a baseball bat.

626
00:40:20,248 --> 00:40:23,848
I really wanted an interactive
piece. That was quite important.

627
00:40:23,848 --> 00:40:27,768
That they weren't just passively,
you know, looking at pieces of work.

628
00:40:27,768 --> 00:40:29,168
ALL: Yeah!

629
00:40:29,168 --> 00:40:31,048
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

630
00:40:36,528 --> 00:40:39,728
I've seen some of them in the
computer...David's computer.

631
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:42,168
But they don't look the
same in the computer.

632
00:40:44,328 --> 00:40:49,648
The Trump paintings, the accent's
very much on the red. The anger.

633
00:40:49,648 --> 00:40:53,008
Whereas Michael's
very much the cool blue

634
00:40:53,008 --> 00:40:55,288
and the relaxed greens

635
00:40:55,288 --> 00:40:57,408
that reflect the diversity

636
00:40:57,408 --> 00:40:59,728
of where they come
from and what they mean

637
00:40:59,728 --> 00:41:02,048
and what their intentions are, you know.

638
00:41:03,368 --> 00:41:07,008
I think these intentions are very angry.

639
00:41:07,008 --> 00:41:09,248
Very self-motivated.

640
00:41:09,248 --> 00:41:11,248
Very self-interested.

641
00:41:16,728 --> 00:41:21,328
The way they display their wealth
and their attitude, you know.

642
00:41:21,328 --> 00:41:24,168
It is very much a contrast
with what goes on here.

643
00:41:24,168 --> 00:41:26,608
But you would expect that.

644
00:41:26,608 --> 00:41:28,968
I mean, he's an international figure,

645
00:41:28,968 --> 00:41:32,288
and Michael's a very...local figure.

646
00:41:32,288 --> 00:41:36,248
He's very much appreciated
by his local friends

647
00:41:36,248 --> 00:41:38,448
and people who know him.

648
00:41:40,048 --> 00:41:43,808
A lot of local people here are
certainly a lot more down to life,

649
00:41:43,808 --> 00:41:48,128
you know. I think living
in the real world, you know.

650
00:41:48,128 --> 00:41:52,248
And it just shows you, you know,
the support we have round about.

651
00:41:52,248 --> 00:41:54,248
..Absolute bias in favour of Trump.

652
00:41:54,248 --> 00:41:59,808
- Aye.
- And reporting his negative and destructive comments about you.

653
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:02,888
- It's very personal, isn't it?
- I know, I know.

654
00:42:02,888 --> 00:42:05,608
Flying about is a
most extravagant thing.

655
00:42:05,608 --> 00:42:08,768
And building a property
and golf development here

656
00:42:08,768 --> 00:42:11,008
to attract American golfers

657
00:42:11,008 --> 00:42:17,408
is...is just contrary to
environmental way of life

658
00:42:17,408 --> 00:42:19,328
that we will have to lead.

659
00:42:23,168 --> 00:42:26,928
It's a personal gift
to Michael and Sheila.

660
00:42:30,128 --> 00:42:34,048
It feels important for me
to give something to them

661
00:42:34,048 --> 00:42:36,728
for all the help that they've given me.

662
00:42:38,488 --> 00:42:41,208
Like all my paintings, I find
it very difficult to talk about

663
00:42:41,208 --> 00:42:43,888
while it's in its early stages.

664
00:42:43,888 --> 00:42:48,448
Um... But it's going to
be an image of Michael

665
00:42:48,448 --> 00:42:50,888
on the salmon fishing boat.

666
00:43:31,368 --> 00:43:36,128
It was a Saturday, and Michael
was washing the Land Rover,

667
00:43:36,128 --> 00:43:38,008
and he also washed Sheila's car.

668
00:43:39,848 --> 00:43:42,288
And then, the hose went to a trickle.

669
00:43:42,288 --> 00:43:45,728
And he says, "Oh, the
water's surely off."

670
00:43:45,728 --> 00:43:49,928
So he came over and said to
me, "Be canny with your water,

671
00:43:49,928 --> 00:43:52,048
"because I think it's going off."

672
00:43:54,848 --> 00:43:57,848
You see that line of trees.

673
00:43:57,848 --> 00:44:00,528
Well, just at this end here,
that's where my well is.

674
00:44:00,528 --> 00:44:02,888
Well, it's a
spring-cum-well.

675
00:44:02,888 --> 00:44:06,208
As you can see, the lorry is
going around there just now.

676
00:44:06,208 --> 00:44:08,768
They built the road on top of my spring.

677
00:44:11,328 --> 00:44:13,488
Well, I think my water is more important

678
00:44:13,488 --> 00:44:15,168
than his bloody road just now.

679
00:44:15,168 --> 00:44:17,768
But, uh...not to them, eh?

680
00:44:20,048 --> 00:44:22,688
I phoned up. They keep saying
they are going to fix it -

681
00:44:22,688 --> 00:44:23,968
I'm still waiting.

682
00:44:23,968 --> 00:44:25,688
You'd think it'd be a priority.

683
00:44:30,448 --> 00:44:32,768
See, no water. Dry.

684
00:44:32,768 --> 00:44:34,328
How long has that been going on for?

685
00:44:34,328 --> 00:44:36,488
That's since last Saturday.

686
00:44:36,488 --> 00:44:38,848
They were digging up
there on the Friday,

687
00:44:38,848 --> 00:44:40,448
and Hewison from down the road here,

688
00:44:40,448 --> 00:44:42,848
he went up and complained
there was no water.

689
00:44:42,848 --> 00:44:44,368
They said they would
get it fixed right away.

690
00:44:44,368 --> 00:44:47,288
Well, that's a week now I've been
waiting and still haven't done it.

691
00:44:47,288 --> 00:44:50,528
I got the police down, and they won't
have nothing to do with it either.

692
00:44:50,528 --> 00:44:53,168
Would be different if it was
the other way around, like.

693
00:44:53,168 --> 00:44:55,928
If it was me cut off their water,
I would have been charged by now.

694
00:44:55,928 --> 00:44:59,928
I'm really pissed off. I'm
running out of clean clothes.

695
00:44:59,928 --> 00:45:03,408
Dishes are piling up.
You know, you need water.

696
00:45:03,408 --> 00:45:07,968
I've been taking water out of the
burn to have a wash in the morning.

697
00:45:07,968 --> 00:45:09,488
It's not right.

698
00:45:19,888 --> 00:45:24,128
I needed water for the hens,
because they drink a lot of water.

699
00:45:24,128 --> 00:45:27,248
My plants outside and
my two greenhouses.

700
00:45:27,248 --> 00:45:33,488
So I took the barrow and...I call
it a "rooser", the watering can,

701
00:45:33,488 --> 00:45:38,848
and a piece of rope tied to a paint pot.

702
00:45:38,848 --> 00:45:42,488
And I dipped in the
paint pot in the burn

703
00:45:42,488 --> 00:45:48,648
and filled the rooser and just
rode the barrow back up again.

704
00:45:48,648 --> 00:45:55,008
And then Michael said, "There's
a wee drop coming from the hose,"

705
00:45:55,008 --> 00:46:00,528
his hose, "So you'll
get some for drinking."

706
00:46:00,528 --> 00:46:03,968
Nothing. Dry.

707
00:46:08,888 --> 00:46:11,488
This is just another
ploy, as I say, with Trump,

708
00:46:11,488 --> 00:46:14,008
to get, to piss people off, you know.

709
00:46:14,008 --> 00:46:15,528
It's not on.

710
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,848
I'm really pissed off as well

711
00:46:19,848 --> 00:46:22,368
that the police is all
one-sided, you know.

712
00:46:22,368 --> 00:46:25,448
They says they're not biased
- of course they are.

713
00:46:25,448 --> 00:46:26,688
HE CHUCKLES

714
00:46:26,688 --> 00:46:27,888
Yeah.

715
00:47:08,528 --> 00:47:10,928
No, I'm just trying to work
out the facts, basically.

716
00:47:10,928 --> 00:47:12,728
No, it's not an angle.
It's not an angle.

717
00:47:12,728 --> 00:47:14,088
I'm just trying to work out

718
00:47:14,088 --> 00:47:16,688
why if Michael has been
without water for a week...

719
00:47:16,688 --> 00:47:20,368
- You know, rather than...
- You know, why...?

720
00:48:25,568 --> 00:48:26,808
Yeah.

721
00:48:39,128 --> 00:48:41,408
What are we looking at over here, then?

722
00:48:41,408 --> 00:48:42,968
Quite a mess now.

723
00:48:42,968 --> 00:48:46,168
We seem to have
inherited a new lake here.

724
00:48:46,168 --> 00:48:50,048
Um... Mr Trump, I don't
know what he's doing.

725
00:48:50,048 --> 00:48:53,608
But he's scraped all this.

726
00:48:53,608 --> 00:48:56,688
Oh, here's the police now.

727
00:48:56,688 --> 00:48:58,248
That's the police there.

728
00:48:58,248 --> 00:48:59,648
You get a photo of them.

729
00:49:01,288 --> 00:49:02,768
'Next thing was the security van

730
00:49:02,768 --> 00:49:04,688
'comes sneaking around the corner there

731
00:49:04,688 --> 00:49:08,368
'and told the police you
were over with Suzy Munro.

732
00:49:08,368 --> 00:49:10,288
'And then, they just
took off up the road.

733
00:49:10,288 --> 00:49:12,448
'And before they went away,
I says to them, I says,'

734
00:49:12,448 --> 00:49:14,448
"Who are you going to charge now?

735
00:49:14,448 --> 00:49:18,008
And he says, "We don't charge
anybody. We're the good guys."

736
00:49:18,008 --> 00:49:21,288
With all due respect, sir, would
you mind turning the camera off?

737
00:49:21,288 --> 00:49:22,488
What's it about?

738
00:49:36,608 --> 00:49:40,408
I bet you they've been
on the phone about this.

739
00:49:40,408 --> 00:49:41,648
Your visit there.

740
00:49:43,288 --> 00:49:45,168
It's absolutely sickening.

741
00:49:46,368 --> 00:49:49,688
Absolutely sickening. This
is what it'll have been about.

742
00:49:51,568 --> 00:49:54,648
I tell you, I hope they get on
to the Environmental Health today,

743
00:49:54,648 --> 00:49:58,288
because having no water for a
week and no toilets, no facilities,

744
00:49:58,288 --> 00:49:59,888
is an absolute disgrace.

745
00:49:59,888 --> 00:50:03,208
They've removed all the
topsoil off the ground.

746
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:05,488
I mean, this is almost
like a flood plain.

747
00:50:05,488 --> 00:50:07,848
As you can see, with the
bulrushes and everything,

748
00:50:07,848 --> 00:50:09,688
it's just marsh ground.

749
00:50:09,688 --> 00:50:12,208
And, of course, common
sense would tell you

750
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:16,368
- that the water, you know, flows down to the...flows down to the sea.
- Yeah.

751
00:50:16,368 --> 00:50:18,608
Common sense would tell anybody that,

752
00:50:18,608 --> 00:50:20,968
so that's going to have to be rectified.

753
00:50:20,968 --> 00:50:22,408
I'm not...

754
00:50:23,728 --> 00:50:26,168
But, as I say,

755
00:50:26,168 --> 00:50:30,128
I think Environmental Health is
the next port of call for them.

756
00:50:30,128 --> 00:50:34,648
- But we'll just have to wait and
see what transpires today. - Uh-huh.

757
00:50:34,648 --> 00:50:37,328
Who's in charge between
the two of you, gentlemen?

758
00:50:37,328 --> 00:50:39,688
We're just here as individuals.
What are you here for?

759
00:50:39,688 --> 00:50:41,368
That's no problem.

760
00:50:41,368 --> 00:50:43,888
Um... Could I take a
note of your name, please?

761
00:50:43,888 --> 00:50:46,688
- Why?
- Because there's been an alleged breach of the peace

762
00:50:46,688 --> 00:50:48,568
up at the Menie Estate this morning.

763
00:50:48,568 --> 00:50:49,688
Oh, God.

764
00:50:49,688 --> 00:50:51,848
And, as such, we are making enquiries.

765
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:53,768
So could I have your name, please?

766
00:50:55,448 --> 00:50:57,448
My name is Richard Phinney.

767
00:50:57,448 --> 00:51:00,328
OK. And yourself, sir, could
I have your name, please?

768
00:51:00,328 --> 00:51:01,608
Yeah, I'm Anthony Baxter.

769
00:51:01,608 --> 00:51:04,168
'And then, he just became
more hostile and more hostile

770
00:51:04,168 --> 00:51:07,088
'and lunged at you,
gave you no explanation.'

771
00:51:07,088 --> 00:51:08,448
What we need to do now...

772
00:51:08,448 --> 00:51:09,768
No, you do not!

773
00:51:09,768 --> 00:51:12,208
You are being detained under Section 14

774
00:51:12,208 --> 00:51:14,608
of the Criminal Procedures
Scotland Act 1995, do not...

775
00:51:14,608 --> 00:51:19,048
- What's he done?
- Richard, can you grab that? Richard, grab the camera.

776
00:51:19,048 --> 00:51:20,928
Let go of the camera.

777
00:51:20,928 --> 00:51:23,768
Let go of the camera
before it gets damaged, sir.

778
00:51:23,768 --> 00:51:25,408
'And then, the next thing I know,

779
00:51:25,408 --> 00:51:28,088
'you're wrestling over the
bonnet of Findlay's van,

780
00:51:28,088 --> 00:51:31,768
'this policeman attacking you,
trying to pull the camera off you,

781
00:51:31,768 --> 00:51:34,288
'still not giving you any
reason why, what you've done.

782
00:51:34,288 --> 00:51:36,728
'I think it was totally out of order.'

783
00:51:36,728 --> 00:51:39,208
- Don't do that to me!
- Right, sir, you're being detained...

784
00:51:39,208 --> 00:51:41,088
'Then, slammed the handcuffs on,

785
00:51:41,088 --> 00:51:44,248
'and I saw your wrist
was grazed and everything.

786
00:51:44,248 --> 00:51:45,888
'And that was totally out of order.'

787
00:51:45,888 --> 00:51:47,768
That's disgraceful!

788
00:51:47,768 --> 00:51:49,848
Will you loosen those cuffs, please?

789
00:51:49,848 --> 00:51:51,568
Will you loosen those cuffs, please?!

790
00:51:51,568 --> 00:51:53,688
This is a very sad state of affairs.

791
00:51:53,688 --> 00:51:56,008
- They are hurting my arms.
- Sir, if you'd stop shouting.

792
00:51:56,008 --> 00:51:58,088
Look, will you stop doing that to me!

793
00:52:10,368 --> 00:52:11,928
It's 8:30 in the evening.

794
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:14,408
I've just got back to my car,

795
00:52:14,408 --> 00:52:19,088
after being in the police
cells for four hours.

796
00:52:19,088 --> 00:52:22,928
We also had our camera confiscated

797
00:52:22,928 --> 00:52:25,408
and our footage
confiscated by the police.

798
00:52:29,768 --> 00:52:33,408
I think it was Susan
that said, you know,

799
00:52:33,408 --> 00:52:35,168
and I was quite upset about it.

800
00:52:35,168 --> 00:52:42,088
I thought, "Oh, gosh, a nice lad
like Anthony being taken into jail."

801
00:52:42,088 --> 00:52:44,848
God, I couldn't sleep,

802
00:52:44,848 --> 00:52:46,368
thinking about it, you know.

803
00:52:46,368 --> 00:52:50,208
I thought, "God, what
like is the Trump people?"

804
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,688
They're horrors.

805
00:52:53,968 --> 00:52:56,088
"Two men charged over filming at Trump."

806
00:52:56,088 --> 00:53:01,088
I'm sick of seeing this "golf
will put northeast on tourism map".

807
00:53:01,088 --> 00:53:03,208
I don't know what he's
wanting to hide here,

808
00:53:03,208 --> 00:53:04,768
but this keeping people away off

809
00:53:04,768 --> 00:53:07,688
this huge swathe of land's not right.

810
00:53:07,688 --> 00:53:11,688
And then, there's that hostile
attack on Anthony for no reason,

811
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:14,688
the police wouldn't give any reason.

812
00:53:16,768 --> 00:53:19,128
The mess he's making?
Well, there's something.

813
00:53:19,128 --> 00:53:22,448
I mean, I've never seen
anything like this, anywhere.

814
00:53:27,608 --> 00:53:29,968
It's against the law to
cut off anybody's water.

815
00:53:29,968 --> 00:53:33,928
And if they had damaged it,
though, supposed it was an accident,

816
00:53:33,928 --> 00:53:36,448
they should have been
supplying him with water.

817
00:53:36,448 --> 00:53:38,768
There and then. You know.

818
00:53:40,408 --> 00:53:41,768
Oh, aye.

819
00:53:43,208 --> 00:53:46,448
'On his hit show, The Apprentice,

820
00:53:46,448 --> 00:53:49,608

821
00:53:49,608 --> 00:53:53,248
'And it appears that power extends

822
00:53:53,248 --> 00:53:54,448
'At least for now.

823
00:53:54,448 --> 00:53:57,288
'Recently, two British journalists

golf resort near Aberdeen...'

825
00:54:01,688 --> 00:54:04,648
You are being detained under
Section 14 of the Criminal...

826
00:54:04,648 --> 00:54:06,048
That's quite incredible.

827
00:54:06,048 --> 00:54:09,368
That is just, that's bullying and
harassment. That really is shocking.

828
00:54:09,368 --> 00:54:12,168
It's an assault on journalists
trying to do their job.

829
00:54:12,168 --> 00:54:14,488
It's completely out of order.

830
00:54:14,488 --> 00:54:17,128
Certainly people from around
the world have been taken aback

831
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:19,048
that this type of thing could happen.

832
00:54:19,048 --> 00:54:21,968
Where journalists are actually
arrested, violently arrested,

833
00:54:21,968 --> 00:54:23,488
handcuffed, taken to the cells,

834
00:54:23,488 --> 00:54:25,408
having been fingerprinted,

835
00:54:25,408 --> 00:54:29,448
DNA tests, having their equipment
taken off them, kept in the cells.

836
00:54:29,448 --> 00:54:31,928
No, I've never seen anything like this.

837
00:54:31,928 --> 00:54:34,368
I know people who have been
done for contempt of court,

838
00:54:34,368 --> 00:54:38,728
covering court cases and
refusing to expose their sources.

839
00:54:38,728 --> 00:54:42,208
But this was just an interference
in journalists trying to film

840
00:54:42,208 --> 00:54:45,408
what really is a public interest story.

841
00:54:47,008 --> 00:54:50,288
'From New York, the
greatest city in the world,

842
00:54:50,288 --> 00:54:55,168
'it's the Late Show
With David Letterman.

843
00:54:55,168 --> 00:54:57,408
'Tonight, Donald Trump.'

844
00:54:59,608 --> 00:55:02,048
This is the guy, this
is the classic story.

845
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:04,968
Donald Trump, big American,
comes, wants to buy up his ranch,

846
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:08,368
or his farm, and he says, "Nope." So is he
going to sell or is he not going to sell?

847
00:55:08,368 --> 00:55:12,408
I don't know, I don't need it. It's not in the
way of what I'm doing. It's on the outskirts.

848
00:55:12,408 --> 00:55:15,368
- And if I buy it, that will be
fine. - Right. - But nothing I need.

849
00:55:15,368 --> 00:55:18,168
So they are using me as an
excuse not to build their hotel.

850
00:55:18,168 --> 00:55:20,488
They're saying, "Oh, it's
an eyesore, a pigsty,"

851
00:55:20,488 --> 00:55:22,528
whatever they want to call it, you know.

852
00:55:22,528 --> 00:55:26,808
But it's a working place. There's
going to be stuff lying about.

853
00:55:26,808 --> 00:55:28,288
I don't throw nothing out,

854
00:55:28,288 --> 00:55:31,128
because you never know
when it's going to be handy.

855
00:55:31,128 --> 00:55:34,848
And I'm bloody sure no other farmer
would throw anything out either.

856
00:55:50,608 --> 00:55:52,688
I was sitting in here,
I was on my computer,

857
00:55:52,688 --> 00:55:54,688
I was looking for parts for my tractors.

858
00:55:54,688 --> 00:55:57,888
And Mickey Foote phoned
in the afternoon and says,

859
00:55:57,888 --> 00:56:00,928
"Do you know there are
diggers on your land?"

860
00:56:00,928 --> 00:56:03,368
So I had a look out and I
saw the diggers working away.

861
00:56:03,368 --> 00:56:05,408
So go over and tell my
mother what was going on,

862
00:56:05,408 --> 00:56:07,808
just in case she got excited.

863
00:56:07,808 --> 00:56:11,968
I was disgusted and felt ill about it.

864
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:16,008
I mean, all that happening
on Michael's land,

865
00:56:16,008 --> 00:56:18,328
that they wanted to buy!

866
00:56:18,328 --> 00:56:21,208
I took my title deed with me.

867
00:56:21,208 --> 00:56:25,048
And I says, "You better just put
everything back where you got it."

868
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,608
And there were two policemen there.

869
00:56:26,608 --> 00:56:29,248
I shouts, I says, "Who's the boss here?"

870
00:56:29,248 --> 00:56:31,368
They didn't do anything about it.

871
00:56:31,368 --> 00:56:37,168
They were guarding THEM pulling
up the poles and putting up fences.

872
00:56:37,168 --> 00:56:40,248
And I tried to show them on
the title deeds what was mine,

873
00:56:40,248 --> 00:56:41,848
and they weren't interested.

874
00:56:41,848 --> 00:56:45,408
They says, "We are just down here to
make sure there's no damage caused."

875
00:56:45,408 --> 00:56:48,448
Bloody damage, they were
ripping up the place.

876
00:56:49,608 --> 00:56:52,488
This is the one I used
to use with my father.

877
00:56:52,488 --> 00:56:54,448
I see them burst it all.

878
00:56:54,448 --> 00:56:57,008
That was the police who was
supposed to be watching it,

879
00:56:57,008 --> 00:56:58,528
that there was no damage done.

880
00:56:58,528 --> 00:57:01,648
It looks really respectful,
eh? They burst it all.

881
00:57:03,248 --> 00:57:05,968
They surely phoned the
security. Here they come now.

882
00:57:08,128 --> 00:57:09,528
They've got a road made now.

883
00:57:09,528 --> 00:57:10,608
HE CHUCKLES

884
00:57:10,608 --> 00:57:12,328
That's my land, aye.

885
00:57:12,328 --> 00:57:14,448
Not now, that belongs to them now.

886
00:57:26,048 --> 00:57:28,728
No, I've seen enough of this.

887
00:57:32,288 --> 00:57:36,128
This here is the original
Menie salmon fishing plans.

888
00:57:36,128 --> 00:57:39,928
And it shows you here,
in black and white,

889
00:57:39,928 --> 00:57:42,928
that this is the land here
for Menie salmon fishers.

890
00:57:42,928 --> 00:57:45,888
But they are saying in the papers today

891
00:57:45,888 --> 00:57:48,848
that their plan supersedes my plan.

892
00:57:48,848 --> 00:57:52,528
This here is Trump's
plan of the same area.

893
00:57:52,528 --> 00:57:56,128
Is here, with this corner cut off.

894
00:58:11,608 --> 00:58:12,888
Andy Wightman.

895
00:58:12,888 --> 00:58:14,368
Mike Forbes.

896
00:58:14,368 --> 00:58:16,448
Good to see you, good to see you.

897
00:58:16,448 --> 00:58:18,568
What a bizarre goings-on.

898
00:58:18,568 --> 00:58:20,568
I'm glad you can laugh
about it sometimes.

899
00:58:20,568 --> 00:58:24,448
- Well, you have to. - Oh,
aye. - You have to, you know.

900
00:58:24,448 --> 00:58:27,568
If you have a dispute with your
neighbour about whose land is whose,

901
00:58:27,568 --> 00:58:29,408
you seek to resolve it amicably

902
00:58:29,408 --> 00:58:31,568
and, ultimately, you
would go to the courts.

903
00:58:31,568 --> 00:58:34,568
You don't grab it. You know,
you don't nakedly grab it.

904
00:58:34,568 --> 00:58:37,128
I mean, that's what
they did in the past.

905
00:58:37,128 --> 00:58:38,728
If everyone was to do that,

906
00:58:38,728 --> 00:58:41,648
it would be a state of
strife across the country.

907
00:58:41,648 --> 00:58:45,168
The police are correct in that where your
boundary is is not a matter for the police.

908
00:58:45,168 --> 00:58:47,288
It's not a criminal
matter. It's a civil matter.

909
00:58:47,288 --> 00:58:50,728
- They shouldn't have been here.
- They shouldn't even have been here.

910
00:58:50,728 --> 00:58:55,008
And the fact that Trump
has got a dispute here,

911
00:58:55,008 --> 00:58:57,608
thinks he owns this land,
that's a civil matter.

912
00:58:57,608 --> 00:59:01,328
Before all this happened,
they put in a line of flags.

913
00:59:01,328 --> 00:59:04,488
Little red flags, with pieces of wire.

914
00:59:04,488 --> 00:59:06,408
And they put them in here.

915
00:59:06,408 --> 00:59:09,328
I removed them all. And
I was charged with theft.

916
00:59:15,168 --> 00:59:18,528
There was all these little bloody
red flags all over the place.

917
00:59:18,528 --> 00:59:20,168
And they were a danger,

918
00:59:20,168 --> 00:59:24,368
cos my grandsons play down
there, and they were sharp wires.

919
00:59:24,368 --> 00:59:27,408
27 I pulled out of my land.

920
00:59:27,408 --> 00:59:29,128
27 of these bloody things.

921
00:59:29,128 --> 00:59:30,408
Is that charge still...?

922
00:59:30,408 --> 00:59:33,288
The Prosecutor Fiscal sent a letter
back saying they'd dropped it,

923
00:59:33,288 --> 00:59:35,328
but if I do anything like that again,

924
00:59:35,328 --> 00:59:37,528
I will be severely dealt with.

925
00:59:37,528 --> 00:59:39,048
So I'm guilty.

926
00:59:39,048 --> 00:59:42,328
You know, I'm guilty and I would
have preferred if it went to court.

927
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:46,728
I mean, to me, that suggests,
you know, double standards.

928
00:59:46,728 --> 00:59:49,608
And very, very political policing.

929
00:59:49,608 --> 00:59:51,528
Have you ever come
across a case like this?

930
00:59:51,528 --> 00:59:53,648
No, no, no.

931
00:59:53,648 --> 00:59:55,088
This is unprecedented.

932
01:00:05,928 --> 01:00:08,888
That's a bit stupid, isn't it?

933
01:00:08,888 --> 01:00:11,328
They've left an access there, look.

934
01:00:11,328 --> 01:00:13,848
Where's it go? Nowhere.

935
01:00:13,848 --> 01:00:16,168
How can he say that's
better than nature? Eh?

936
01:00:16,168 --> 01:00:18,808
HE LAUGHS

937
01:00:18,808 --> 01:00:20,888
Boy, the man lives in cuckooland.

938
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:32,400
That flag stands for freedom

939
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:36,760
and for a country that you are
passionate about, presumably.

940
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,880
Used to be. I used to be.

941
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,520
Until Salmond gave them the
right to destroy the bloody links.

942
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:45,440
I voted for SNP for 35 years.

943
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,240
I'll never ever vote
for them again. Never.

944
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,920
They've done this country wrong.

945
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,000
They're giving it away to the Americans.

946
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,160
HE CHUCKLES

947
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:08,360
'American tycoon Donald
Trump has jetted into Aberdeen

948
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,560
'ahead of receiving an honorary degree

949
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:13,040
'from the city's Robert
Gordon University.

950
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,840
'This afternoon, the
Tripping Up Trump campaign

951
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,960
'handed in a 6,500 signature petition

952
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,800
'against the university's decision.'

953
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:24,080
It's really quite sad
to see what he is doing.

954
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,880
I thought it was going to be done
with a little tweak here and there,

955
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,240
but it's not, it's just been flattened,

956
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,960
especially the bit beside us,
and he's just moving south.

957
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:36,360
Awful that our, you know, our country
have let him take an SSI and that,

958
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:40,080
and I'm sure he's having a
quick smile to himself, you know.

959
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:58,280
They swarm around him like flies.

960
01:01:58,280 --> 01:01:59,880
Whenever he's here.

961
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,480
And I mean, it's just a joke.

962
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:04,680
I also think it's just
so false, you know.

963
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:08,360
All these people arriving
suited and booted.

964
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:11,440
And, "Yes, Mr Trump." "No, Mr Trump."

965
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,960
What has he done here to deserve this

966
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:17,200
but destroy a Site Of
Special Scientific Interest

967
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,840
and a beautiful dune system?

968
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:44,960
The people love what we're doing.

969
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:48,760
They love that I'm spending hundreds
of millions of pounds on doing it.

970
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:51,320
They love the fact that
I'm creating a lot of jobs.

971
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:57,000
Mr Trump doesn't appreciate
just how much this system moves.

972
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,080
None of these things
will ever come back,

973
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:01,800
cos the conditions
will be totally changed.

974
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,320
All these damn chemicals
on the greens, and...

975
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:07,960
Ah, me.

976
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:11,360
You just wonder where it's
going to end with this.

977
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,800
The last time he was here,

978
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:23,320
he made quite a rather sour comment

979
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:26,080
about myself and Findlay and the dog.

980
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:27,600
You, know, "Demonstrators."

981
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:30,760
And I thought, "I'm not a
demonstrator. I live here."

982
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,400
This one was from the students.

983
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,560
And any gift from the
students I always valued.

984
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:53,760
Because I thought that
was what my work was about.

985
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,040
From the moment I decided

986
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:04,080
that I was going to hand
my honorary degree back,

987
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:08,080
my thoughts were all about how I
could get the maximum publicity.

988
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:12,880
Because I knew that simply handing
it back in a private manner,

989
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:16,120
it would simply be put away
and that would be the end of it.

990
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:19,280
How difficult is it for
you to return this degree?

991
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,000
It's not difficult at all.

992
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,480
I'm going to march in that door

993
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,560
and ask whether the
Principal is available.

994
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,920
If he isn't, it will
be given into the desk.

995
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:28,120
And that will be it.

996
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:30,720
Because somebody's got to
stand up to these people

997
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:33,400
and make sure that the world knows

998
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,480
there are people who
don't approve of this.

999
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:37,240
I don't approve of bullying.

1000
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:41,080
I don't approve of bullying to
the people on the Menie Estate.

1001
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:44,400
That is my honorary degree certificate.

1002
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,600
Not wanted! Not wanted!

1003
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:48,400
APPLAUSE

1004
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:53,600
For someone in such a
significant and serious position

1005
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:57,720
to take what is obviously a very
personal and determined stance

1006
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,880
is a very positive thing for us.

1007
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:03,400
And we are here in pure support
of Dr Kennedy and his position.

1008
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:08,800
Donald Trump has said he
thinks you cannae be too greedy.

1009
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:12,040
He believes that you should
be brutal and powerful.

1010
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:15,360
He believes that sacking
people is not a bad thing.

1011
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,680
He boasts of the number
of people he's sacked.

1012
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:20,200
These are not the sort of
qualities I would expect of a man

1013
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,680
who is to receive an honorary degree.

1014
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,880
APPLAUSE

1015
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,520
He feels very strongly.

1016
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:28,400
And I think, under those circumstances,

1017
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,160
it isn't a difficult decision to make.

1018
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,800
David, what happened inside?

1019
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,280
Well, Professor Harper wasn't available.

1020
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:39,760
And so I saw one of
the Vice-Principals.

1021
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,120
But, of course, she's
following the party line

1022
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:47,000
that Mr Trump is a very
successful entrepreneur,

1023
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,440
he's a billionaire, and, of
course, that tells you everything.

1024
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,200
- (ON RADIO)
- ' "They're making a mockery of the system,"

1025
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,760
'in the words of Dr David Kennedy,

1026
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:00,240
'who's handed back his honorary
degree to Robert Gordon University.

1027
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,560
'And he has this message for the tycoon.

1028
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,360
'Don't trample on your neighbours.'

1029
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,600
Don't destroy the
environment of Aberdeen.

1030
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:10,480
This is part of the jewels of
Scotland that are being destroyed.

1031
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,160
My view is take your money
elsewhere. We don't want it.

1032
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:24,560
A positive paper, but it's
letting people know the truth.

1033
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:25,800
Because we feel that people

1034
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,800
don't know the realities
of this development.

1035
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:29,720
And if they did know,
they'd think twice.

1036
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:31,240
There's some people in Aberdeen

1037
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:34,080
that really want this development
to go ahead. Powerful people.

1038
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:37,840
And they're not letting the
word out on what's going on.

1039
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:39,440
- Have you been out at Menie House?
- Yes.

1040
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,840
And have you seen some
of the ramshackle dumps

1041
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:43,120
that are round there?

1042
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:44,480
If you mean Michael Forbes'...

1043
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,240
I'm not referring to anybody specific -

1044
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,560
I'm talking in general terms.

1045
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:49,800
- Have you seen it?
- Um... I've been to Menie, yes.

1046
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:50,960
Here's the point.

1047
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:54,000
You take in wealthy people from
all over the world, flying in,

1048
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,520
and they're playing there
and they're looking at houses

1049
01:06:56,520 --> 01:07:00,040
that are in bad condition,
with ramshackle tractors

1050
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:02,400
and old farm implements
lying over there.

1051
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:03,760
Do you think that does any good

1052
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,280
to the vision of Scotland
throughout the world?

1053
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:08,560
BAGPIPES PLAY

1054
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:28,040
'American billionaire Donald
Trump defied his critics'

1055
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:32,240
to pick up an honorary degree from
Aberdeen's Robert Gordon University.

1056
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:35,000
He's pledged to build the
world's greatest golf course

1057
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,560
on the Menie Estate in Aberdeenshire.

1058
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:40,360
'Today, Aberdeen's
Robert Gordon University

1059
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:45,240

Administration...'

1061
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:51,240
- Just a casual shot against the railing would be quite nice.
- Lovely!

1062
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:56,480
Can we get the "You're
Fired" again, Mr Trump?

1063
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:58,920
Thank you very much.

1064
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,120
Hello, everybody.

1065
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:05,920
Is the course on schedule?

1066
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:08,800
Yeah, the course is in perfect schedule.

1067
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:11,000
In fact, if anything,
it's ahead of schedule.

1068
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,840
And I am very happy to report
that everything we've done...

1069
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,560
I think it's even coming out

1070
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,240
better than we had anticipated
in our wildest dreams.

1071
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:21,480
It's going to be really spectacular.

1072
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:24,240
There doesn't seem to be
people against the job.

1073
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:26,480
The only one I see is
this gentleman right here,

1074
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:29,760
who I've never seen before until
yesterday when he started screaming.

1075
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:32,720
Question? Real journalists.
I want real journalists.

1076
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:35,240
Mr Trump, I wonder what
you'd say to Dr David Kennedy.

1077
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,760
He handed back his degree last week

1078
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:42,040
and said that your honour was an
insult to decent people everywhere,

1079
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:46,680
and also accused you of bullying
people on the Menie Estate.

1080
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:50,880
And, I mean, I myself have
been arrested, handcuffed

1081
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,680
and put in a prison cell for four hours

1082
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:55,320
whilst interviewing your
representative, Mr Paul O'Connor,

1083
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:59,160
on the site. I just wondered whether
you felt that was the right way

1084
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:03,360
to treat people and whether, in
fact, you had anything to hide.

1085
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:05,960
I never heard of Mr Kennedy.
I don't know who he is.

1086
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:07,520
So I can't really refer.

1087
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,800
I mean, you're asking me about a
person that I've never heard of.

1088
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,560
Dr David Kennedy, the
former Principal of...

1089
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:15,160
I've never heard of him. I'm sorry.

1090
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:17,160
This is a very popular job.

1091
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:22,040
It's only questions like you ask
that, you know, cause trouble.

1092
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:25,840
- Any other questions?
- Yes, Mr Trump, I just wonder if you could tell us

1093
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:28,360
- how many local people...?
- One question per journalist.

1094
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:32,040
- How many local people were employed on the site at the moment?
- A lot.

1095
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:34,480
We have a lot of local people
employed and we are just...

1096
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:35,600
Can you give us a number?

1097
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:36,880
I don't have numbers.

1098
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,760
We are just beginning,
but a lot of people.

1099
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,360
And there will be more and more.

1100
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:42,400
We've had hundreds of
people doing the marram,

1101
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,400
we're ready to start
the marram grass again.

1102
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:45,840
That's a very big project.

1103
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:48,560
But we've got a lot of local
people employed on the site.

1104
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,040
But it is an Irish contractor.

1105
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:06,520
So I'm going to go and phone the
police shortly and let them know.

1106
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:09,280
Take it from there. I've
also spoken to a lawyer.

1107
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:14,280
I'm phoning in connection

1108
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:16,760
with an incident number you
already have on your books.

1109
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:20,160
Incident 56, of the 18th of October.

1110
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:22,360
In other words, yesterday.

1111
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:25,400
Well, it was regarding,
we expected certain persons

1112
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:28,680
to come on to our land yesterday
and cut down and remove a fence.

1113
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:30,000
That didn't happen.

1114
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,920
However, they have come on TODAY
and cut down and removed that fence.

1115
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:40,120
This is the letter that we received.

1116
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:41,920
They are saying that I "have a fence

1117
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:43,880
"and part of a shed (or other building)

1118
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:45,720
"erected on land belonging to them."

1119
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:51,800
They are saying that they now
intend to remove the fence -

1120
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:54,360
you'll notice I'm not given
the option to remove it myself -

1121
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:55,600
and that they may,

1122
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:58,720
if they choose, put the fence
back up on their drawing.

1123
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:07,240
As far as the shed goes,
they're giving me 72 hours

1124
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:09,640
or they are going to raise
an action in the Sheriff Court

1125
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,640
to have it removed.

1126
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:15,200
If you take the double
garage, it's sitting here.

1127
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:19,040
OK. I have a stick shed sits here.

1128
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:22,240
There's an old brick shed from
the coastguard days sits there.

1129
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:25,360
And the house actually
sits in about here.

1130
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:33,280
Out here, there is a pole for
the overhead electricity line.

1131
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:36,080
They are claiming, at the moment,

1132
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,760
that this boundary, actually,

1133
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:41,920
runs something like that.

1134
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:49,320
And here, they're tying to take
the back wall off my garage.

1135
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:53,880
We've been very nice.
We've tried to be very nice.

1136
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:55,960
We actually just
learned that one of them

1137
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:58,360
may have built their house on our land.

1138
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:01,440
We learned that last night,
when we were doing a survey.

1139
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:06,680
One of the people actually have a
big chunk of their house on our land.

1140
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:08,560
So we're having that checked out.

1141
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,640
You'll find out.

1142
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:15,720
I've come home today. I
see the fence is missing.

1143
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:18,120
That's a police car that
was in here this morning.

1144
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:22,560
Which makes it eight, nine, ten
o'clock this morning or thereby.

1145
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,400
So it will be interesting to see

1146
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,480
what time the fence actually came down.

1147
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:30,040
They hit the power line yesterday.

1148
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:32,720
240 volt supply to my house.

1149
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:36,560
Mr Trump's workmen severed
the line with the digger,

1150
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,760
popped the line, and, of
course, everything shorted,

1151
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,840
and it cut everybody off.

1152
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:45,960
It's working away, quite
the thing. There you go.

1153
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:47,400
Power went out.

1154
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:58,680
The fence that they put
up without my permission.

1155
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:00,680
"The attached invoice is now due.

1156
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:05,160
"Please arrange payment for
half of this invoice, £2,820,

1157
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:09,200
"to be made payable to Trump
International Golf Links, Scotland."

1158
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:18,600
I got out of my bed this
morning, the whole house shaking.

1159
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,800
Things falling off Findlay's shelf.

1160
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:25,360
But this is getting bigger by
the day. It's incredibly high now.

1161
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:27,960
Did you ask the builders what
they were doing with this?

1162
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:29,360
Findlay did.

1163
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,680
What did they say?

1164
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:32,360
It's Mr Trump's instructions.

1165
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:34,960
- Mr Trump's instructions?
- Yeah.

1166
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,280
To put all this earth here.

1167
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:38,440
Yeah, to block our view, to harass us.

1168
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:42,880
Obviously. There's no bank on
the plans. Anything like that.

1169
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:45,480
Oh, I don't know what to do.

1170
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:32,800
It's...rather meaningless.

1171
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:37,240
Took them a maybe a week, ten
days, to actually construct.

1172
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:39,840
So there's quite a lot of work involved.

1173
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:43,520
There's a lot of time involved, there's a
lot of effort involved. For no real purpose.

1174
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,680
Get it done and don't spend a lot.

1175
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:52,120
'It's all on Donald J Trump's
Fabulous World Of Golf.'

1176
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:56,000
Sarah, I want to get rid of that house.

1177
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,440
Who cares? Who cares?

1178
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:02,760
You know what, who cares? It's our
property. We can do what we want.

1179
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:06,480
We're trying to build the greatest
course in the world, this house is ugly.

1180
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:09,600
There are some houses, quite
far away from the course,

1181
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,640
but, nevertheless, they are in view.

1182
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:15,440
But we are berming some of the area
so that you don't see the houses.

1183
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:16,960
I don't want to see the houses.

1184
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:18,600
And nobody has a problem with it.

1185
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:21,080
I guess maybe the people
that live in the houses have.

1186
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,480
There's a great big pond here.

1187
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:30,520
Now, the more mud they're scraping,
the water is all bubbling up.

1188
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:32,520
I was just waiting for that.

1189
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:34,040
The water?

1190
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:35,760
Yeah, water table, they've hit it.

1191
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,640
It's supposed to be a putting green.

1192
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:40,560
I could cope, I suppose you'd
have to cope with a putting green.

1193
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:42,840
Not that I'd like balls
flying in my garden.

1194
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:45,400
But they've come today,
"We're making a car park."

1195
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:47,880
No, you're not, it's not on your plans.

1196
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:51,280
That big mound in front of us
that shouldn't have been done.

1197
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,960
Not on the plans.

1198
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,640
Cos there's just the dunes there, Kim,

1199
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,840
but the bit we used to
walk over onto the beach.

1200
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:59,680
I took photos on Anthony's camera.

1201
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:02,160
I mean, we got a shock. We
just stood and looked round.

1202
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:05,040
Totally flat. Sand
everywhere. Everything gone.

1203
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:22,240
'I'm imagining now how
beautiful it must be.

1204
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:24,440
'These dunes on the
beautiful coast of Scotland.

1205
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:26,880
- 'The west coast of Scotland?
- Well, yes, more or less.'

1206
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:29,040
And... Uh, what do you
mean, "more or less"?

1207
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,360
LAUGHTER

1208
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:33,480
It's such a big area, it
covers a lot of territory.

1209
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:37,200
'It's so beautiful.

1210
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,520
'It is beautiful, but I'll
make it more beautiful.

1211
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:42,000
'Actually, when I finish, it
will be far more beautiful.

1212
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,640
- 'Really?
- Yep. That's right.'

1213
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:52,960
I'm not fond of Donald Trump.

1214
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:56,720
And I wouldn't want to come all
this way to go play a new course,

1215
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:59,600
nor one of his facility courses, so...

1216
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:04,080
I'm not sure that it's going to
be a very successful operation.

1217
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,600
You know, he's pretty gaudy.

1218
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,680
I mean, that is the way he does things.

1219
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:09,280
You know, he's a New Yorker.

1220
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:10,920
HE CHUCKLES

1221
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:15,000
So...I'm sure it will
be a spectacular course.

1222
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,680
I'm not sure it will fit in with,
you know, the tradition, so...

1223
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:21,440
He says it's going to
be the best in the world.

1224
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:24,760
Well, Donald would say
that, wouldn't he, you know?

1225
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:27,800
Trump will price it most
likely outside of my range.

1226
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:40,360
Of course, there will
be some local workers.

1227
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:43,080
The question is, what proportion
of workers will be local.

1228
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:46,040
And there, I think that
the estimates that are made

1229
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:50,600
in the economic impact
study are wildly optimistic.

1230
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:51,800
I mean, if I were Irish,

1231
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:54,360
I'd be delighted if Irish
workers were being employed.

1232
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:57,440
If I were Polish, I'm delighted that
Polish workers are being employed.

1233
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:00,120
But they're not going to be
creating jobs in the local economy.

1234
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:02,160
And indeed, migrant workers

1235
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:04,760
tend to remit a lot of their
wages back to where they come from.

1236
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:07,200
So they wouldn't be spending
within the local economy.

1237
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:12,040
If a British developer came along saying

1238
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:15,440
that they wanted to build 500 houses

1239
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:21,880
and a 450-bed hotel on
an area of wild beauty,

1240
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:24,720
remote from any large city,

1241
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:27,280
which was going to destroy

1242
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:31,480
what is the most highly
protected type of site we have,

1243
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:34,000
a Site Of Special Scientific Interest,

1244
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:39,240
which was, by all accounts,
a unique type of site,

1245
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:41,560
they would be laughed out of court.

1246
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:50,440
Think of Mr Trump as a poker player.

1247
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:54,720
And he's got a hand, but he's
also bluffing the local authorities

1248
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:58,320
and the Scottish Government to
give him planning permission.

1249
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:01,440
That planning permission is
immensely, immensely valuable.

1250
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:03,760
Thousands of millions
of pounds, probably.

1251
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,440
Just to get the planning permission.

1252
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:09,560
So his job is to persuade people

1253
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,440
that there's huge economic benefits.

1254
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:13,440
That's his job.

1255
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:17,920
But we should be critically
cautious in accepting numbers

1256
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,720
which come from the Trump camp.

1257
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:22,200
And from what you've
seen of those numbers,

1258
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,800
do you think there has
been enough caution?

1259
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:28,040
No, I don't think there's
been enough caution

1260
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:30,000
in critically
interpreting those numbers.

1261
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:34,600
It's not surprising that sort
of city fathers might be deceived

1262
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:39,680
by a glamorous international
superstar like Donald Trump.

1263
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:42,280
I do find it more surprising
that the Scottish Government,

1264
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:46,800
who I thought was quite canny, has
fallen for it in the way they have.

1265
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:50,920
BAGPIPE PLAYS

1266
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,200
This is the pond where
all the ducks were.

1267
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:16,640
I don't know what they've done,
but they've now, as you can see,

1268
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:19,480
got this fenced off
with this orange netting.

1269
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:28,440
It's horrifying, of
course, to see, you know,

1270
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:31,600
the sand just piled up
like that, willy-nilly.

1271
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:34,520
This was a pristine and
fantastic dune system,

1272
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:38,680
and now parts of it are in
the process of being wrecked.

1273
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:40,400
And that's very sad.

1274
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,400
And as things stand at the moment,

1275
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:45,280
much of the rest of it is
going to be wrecked as well.

1276
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:47,680
BAGPIPE PLAYS

1277
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:54,000
Fine, fine, eh.

1278
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:58,000
It's good, this is great.

1279
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,080
My name's Michael. I'm
just up from Glasgow today.

1280
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,520
Just to offer you some support.

1281
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,000
Excellent. Thank you.

1282
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,600
Good luck.

1283
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:23,360
- Hi. How are you doing?
- Fine day for it.

1284
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:26,320
- To show you a bit of support.
- Thank you very much.

1285
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:36,040
ALL: Come and join us!

1286
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:38,040
Join us!

1287
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:43,760
It's good to see that there's
so many young people here

1288
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:45,440
supporting justice.

1289
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:49,800
And I'm at one with
them. I agree completely.

1290
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:52,880
And I find it very, very, very pleasing

1291
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:55,480
to see so many people turning out today

1292
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:59,800
in order to support the
people who are being victimised

1293
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:03,160
by Donald Trump and
his profit-making ways.

1294
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,760
I'm very proud, yah.

1295
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:08,040
It gives you a boost.

1296
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:09,600
It really gives you a boost.

1297
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:14,440
You know, when you are down in the
mouth about what is going on here

1298
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:17,880
and then you get all these people
supporting you, it's really good.

1299
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:20,000
Yeah, I'm really proud.

1300
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,240
What kind of things
have they been saying?

1301
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:25,400
Oh, just keep up the fight.
It's always the same, every time.

1302
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:27,840
Keep up the fight. I'm doing my best!

1303
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:30,120
HE LAUGHS

1304
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:49,440
Can I help you, gentlemen?

1305
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:52,560
Yes, I'd like to use the telephone.
Is there one in the hotel?

1306
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,840
There's a phone box just
across the road at the jetty.

1307
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:56,360
You'll need some change.

1308
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:58,640
Aye, you can talk to anyone
in the world from there.

1309
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:01,080
Could you change this
for me? Ten's the lot.

1310
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:03,880
Now, I don't think I'll manage that.

1311
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:06,320
You got any change, lads?

1312
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:10,720
'The gentleman here would like to make a very
important long-distance phone call. Intercontinental.

1313
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:12,920
'Come on, give me your change.'

1314
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,840
RINGING TONE

1315
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:20,560
'Trump Organization.'

1316
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:23,120
Oh, hello there, yes. I was
wondering if I could speak

1317
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:24,720
to Donald Trump, please?

1318
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:25,880
I'm calling from Scotland,

1319
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:28,120
just recording this call
My name is Anthony Baxter.

1320
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:30,880
'OK, what was it regarding?'

1321
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:32,640
Yes, I'm making a documentary

1322
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:36,120
about the Trump Golf Course
development north of Aberdeen

1323
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:38,600
and just wondered whether I
could speak to him about it.

1324
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:40,600
'I could give you the email address...'

1325
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:43,600
Yeah, I did email Rhona a few
times, actually, last year...

1326
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,880
'Do you have the correct email address?'

1327
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:48,320
I think so, because she
returned the email saying

1328
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:51,600
that he was too busy to do
an interview at the time.

1329
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:54,480
- So I just thought I would touch base.
- '..if you like.'

1330
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:57,360
Right, I did do that, and then,
I didn't hear anything back.

1331
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:00,120
I mean, I don't mind waiting
for her meeting to finish.

1332
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:02,880
It's just that I've only
got so many 50p's here.

1333
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,960
And I can't just speak to Mr Trump's PA?

1334
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:08,320
'Hold on a moment.'

1335
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:09,800
OK.

1336
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,400
OK, thanks.

1337
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:18,080
COINS DROP INTO TELEPHONE SLOT

1338
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,320
- 'Hello?'
- Hello.

1339
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:25,720
'OK, sir, I'm sorry, but that's the
only possibility, to email Rhona.

1340
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:27,800
'I'm sorry, I have to take other calls.'

1341
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:29,840
SHE HANGS UP THE PHONE
