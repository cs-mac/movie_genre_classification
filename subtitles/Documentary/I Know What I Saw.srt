2
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:23,872
Is it good?

3
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:26,049
All right. Are you ready?

4
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,685
Not at all.

5
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:34,767
We talk to Graham Windsor.

6
00:00:34,867 --> 00:00:38,228
He had his first chord our public
interview to give since the incident.

7
00:00:38,328 --> 00:00:40,829
Good morning, Graham.
- Good morning.

8
00:00:40,931 --> 00:00:42,791
Thank my story
to share with you.

9
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,744
It is therefore promises to be fascinating one story.

10
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,238
Tell me ... where did it start?

11
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,165
Was it on the set?

12
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:54,470
No, actually it started
in Palm Springs.

13
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,960
I answered today
no phone, Bernie.

14
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,620
You just did, Graham.

15
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:29,256
To remind you
Today I want to talk to anyone.

16
00:02:29,356 --> 00:02:30,924
Not even with you.

17
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:34,298
You can not keep hiding.
The press desperate for an explanation.

18
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,921
Let them do.

19
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,783
Graham, they can make
or they can break you.

20
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:42,293
I'm already broken.
End of story.

21
00:02:42,327 --> 00:02:46,346
We can work this out.
- You can do it, it's your job.

22
00:02:46,415 --> 00:02:48,709
Before I pay you
outrageous amount of money.

23
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,178
Are you going to tell them the truth or what?

24
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,681
Bernie, you're a great manager.

25
00:02:54,881 --> 00:02:56,742
But you're telling the media
never the truth.

26
00:02:56,842 --> 00:02:58,644
Graham, I'm your manager.

27
00:02:58,844 --> 00:03:01,079
And I tell you that you ...
- Bye, Bernie.

28
00:03:01,179 --> 00:03:02,431
Graham <i>! </ i>

29
00:03:49,645 --> 00:03:52,481
For the third time,
this is not a nudist residence.

30
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,867
Before you can go anywhere
in Palm Springs.

31
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:59,011
But where do I get a service like this?
- In the sauna down the street.

32
00:03:59,196 --> 00:04:01,615
Just be a good boy
and pull it to.

33
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,160
Everyone has' m already seen.
What does it matter?

34
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,996
Because I have rules.
- You know what they say about rules?

35
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,849
That you will be thrown out,
if you do not show up.

36
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,777
Jesus, rejected
by people I trust.

37
00:04:13,877 --> 00:04:16,978
Why does that look familiar?
- The Martyrdom suits you not.

38
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,158
That might make me over
not cast for the new series.

39
00:04:20,258 --> 00:04:22,636
Yeah, that's probably the reason.
Put this on.

40
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:28,063
Coffee? - Can you make in your room
with those expensive coffee.

41
00:04:28,141 --> 00:04:30,810
Do I look like I know
how a machine works?

42
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,688
If you're not fucking was so clever ...

43
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,890
Then I was not in this shit.

44
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:39,027
Coffee in five minutes.
If you're dressed.

45
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:06,863
What?

46
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:11,017
I need time for myself,
I have already told you.

47
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,379
Stop. Stop calling me.

48
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,150
Really?

49
00:05:19,735 --> 00:05:22,279
Well, there it was but should have thought
for you gave that interview.

50
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,825
No! No, we ...

51
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,700
We would not disclose
until the right time.

52
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,700
You blew it, because you love
've become on Anderson Cooper.

53
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,419
You know ... I'll let you know
when I come back home.

54
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,923
No, I thought you
though it would be gone.

55
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:51,708
Where do you think I am? We have this
two months ago reserved.

56
00:05:52,108 --> 00:05:53,408
Yes ...

57
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,982
Talk to anybody about this, please.
Can you do that for me?

58
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,208
Thank you.

59
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,621
And call me no more
while I'm gone.

60
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,740
Hey! Do you know where I can check?

61
00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:55,638
Thank you.

62
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:03,797
Are you Graham Windsor not?
That soap actor?

63
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,283
Not anymore.

64
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:12,430
Yes, I have seen on the internet ...

65
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,188
What did you do on the Internet?

66
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:25,151
What? You mean your sex video?

67
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:28,822
Yes, I have seen.

68
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,158
Course. What did you think?

69
00:07:34,411 --> 00:07:36,353
I've seen better.

70
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,057
Wait a minute ...

71
00:07:40,876 --> 00:07:43,962
I know you too.
- Yeah, right.

72
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,700
You're the big gay marriage activist,
Trey Reed.

73
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:51,386
That's me. "Marry her."

74
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,796
I've read all your statements
on Proposition 8.

75
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,448
And I've seen the manifestations
you have organized. Impressive.

76
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,970
Apparently not impressive enough
for you ...

77
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,565
your closet to drag you to join us.

78
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,116
That's not fair.

79
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:08,111
Please, say that all actors
in which the cabinet.

80
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,262
Too bad that video was needed you ...

81
00:08:11,865 --> 00:08:15,810
seriously in the zijk turn, so you
would admit that you are one of us.

82
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,695
No, wait.

83
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,832
You do not have any official statement
made, is not it?

84
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,276
It's nobody's business.

85
00:08:23,376 --> 00:08:27,005
You're a public figure,
it affects us all.

86
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,534
By the way ... I've read
about your divorce.

87
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,053
Your case will be yours now fixed
totally awesome.

88
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:37,865
'Gay marriage activist cheating spouse.
The divorce is deployed.

89
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,735
Apparently the gay community
the marriage is not so good. "

90
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,379
And that does not even Fox News.

91
00:08:43,579 --> 00:08:46,666
There is much more to it.
You must understand that anyway?

92
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,527
The media distort the truth.

93
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,854
When you do, and not with me?

94
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,892
The immortal words of Dolly Parton:

95
00:08:55,992 --> 00:08:59,495
"Come down from the cross,
anyone who has required pole. "

96
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:04,917
Well, a pole need
apparently your specialty.

97
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:13,176
You're in Suite No. 3.
That's it.

98
00:09:15,095 --> 00:09:17,096
Are you alone?

99
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,007
The reservation was for a couple.

100
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,519
The plans have changed.

101
00:09:24,938 --> 00:09:27,315
I am sorry

102
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:32,362
Should I leave the cake in the room?

103
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,681
I had clean forgotten.

104
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:37,600
I can 't take away ...

105
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,559
Forget it.

106
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,254
Well, it is very quiet.

107
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:45,884
There is a very quiet young man
Suite No. 4 in.

108
00:09:46,084 --> 00:09:47,919
And a nice couple in No. 1.

109
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,804
And in No. 2?

110
00:09:50,672 --> 00:09:53,341
There's ...

111
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,812
Super.

112
00:09:59,848 --> 00:10:02,850
Hopefully his room many closets.

113
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,355
It is a suite, room no.

114
00:10:08,398 --> 00:10:11,575
And let him alone.
It's a nice boy.

115
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,554
It is one of the reasons
why we have so many problems ...

116
00:10:14,654 --> 00:10:16,539
to be accepted
by society.

117
00:10:16,739 --> 00:10:18,190
If more actors came out of the closet ...

118
00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:20,685
I know people like you would want
that all actors were gay.

119
00:10:20,785 --> 00:10:22,536
You know what? They're not.

120
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,780
Really?

121
00:10:23,788 --> 00:10:27,466
Believe it or not, but I'm two years
reporter been bought for us this hotel.

122
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:30,778
I have interviewed many actors whose
everyone assumed they were gay.

123
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:34,899
And you know what?
Maybe three of them were that maximum.

124
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,144
Who then?

125
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,664
Do not bother.

126
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,315
Trust me.

127
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:47,350
And those who were gay, found that they
had good reason to stay in the closet.

128
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:51,880
Financial reasons, you mean.
- You probably never do anything for money.

129
00:10:54,152 --> 00:10:55,928
He's coming here for years.

130
00:10:56,321 --> 00:10:57,580
I like him.

131
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,540
He just wants to work.

132
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:02,209
What's wrong with that?

133
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,263
Nothing ... I think.

134
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,407
Well, you think is correct.

135
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,219
Until now this hotel
their hideout.

136
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:13,421
Where nobody cared who they were.

137
00:11:14,214 --> 00:11:15,381
They?

138
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:18,075
He and his friend. Ex-boyfriend.

139
00:11:18,175 --> 00:11:20,836
Well, at this point probably
nevertheless ex-boyfriend.

140
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,164
Was the one who
with him was to be seen in the video?

141
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:27,993
Are you a reporter?

142
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,279
God, no. I hate reporters.

143
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,690
Except you, of course.
- I hate reporters.

144
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,195
So we came to Palm Springs
and we bought the hotel.

145
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,823
To start a new life.

146
00:11:42,117 --> 00:11:44,400
We?
- My partner, Philip, and I.

147
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,463
And then he died and ...

148
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,840
I sat here all alone.

149
00:11:52,836 --> 00:11:55,402
I am sorry
- That's a good thing ...

150
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,841
You would also be grateful
for everything you have.

151
00:12:10,854 --> 00:12:13,222
How are we going to such a topic?

152
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,917
I asked about the sex video
the queen in the closet.

153
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,343
Right, right, right ...

154
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:20,846
I honestly have no idea
with whom he was on that video to be seen.

155
00:12:20,946 --> 00:12:22,806
I'm not looking at anything.

156
00:12:24,534 --> 00:12:26,327
Okay, I saw the pictures on the internet.

157
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,399
What?

158
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,877
If the Grahams boyfriend
those video leaked ...

159
00:12:36,546 --> 00:12:38,430
the pain should not do?

160
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:11,747
Happy birthday, dammit.

161
00:13:25,637 --> 00:13:27,971
Sorry about that later.
- Rightly.

162
00:13:31,518 --> 00:13:33,452
I mean, thank you.

163
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,748
It's just ...

164
00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:40,041
It's just what?

165
00:13:42,612 --> 00:13:45,614
I do not understand.
I really do not understand ...

166
00:13:46,324 --> 00:13:51,220
that you do not get up and say:
"This is who I am. Point on the line. '

167
00:13:51,496 --> 00:13:55,391
You would not really understand.
Your whole existence revolves around being gay.

168
00:13:55,917 --> 00:13:57,467
Pardon?

169
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,654
You work every day with gay issues.

170
00:14:00,754 --> 00:14:02,807
You live firmly in the middle of West Hollywood.

171
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,568
Your friends are probably all gay.
In the evening, you sit in gay clubs.

172
00:14:06,635 --> 00:14:08,537
You spend your holidays by
on gay cruises.

173
00:14:08,637 --> 00:14:11,464
You are a professional gay.
- So what?

174
00:14:11,766 --> 00:14:13,901
Somebody has to fight for our rights.

175
00:14:14,101 --> 00:14:17,187
And that's your choice.
I chose to be an actor.

176
00:14:17,287 --> 00:14:19,740
And the only way I work
can get by staying in the closet.

177
00:14:20,066 --> 00:14:22,802
The audience does not need to know everything
about my private life.

178
00:14:22,902 --> 00:14:25,295
How can you two so easily
separated from each other?

179
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:28,131
The public has a right to know.
- No.

180
00:14:28,283 --> 00:14:30,000
The public has a right to know
of cases in the closet ...

181
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,736
politicians who vote against
laws for gay rights.

182
00:14:32,954 --> 00:14:35,139
They have no right
to know who I sleep.

183
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,542
You would be better to understand
than anyone.

184
00:14:38,835 --> 00:14:40,285
Do not you dare.

185
00:14:42,297 --> 00:14:44,698
You fight for years
equal marriage rights.

186
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:46,640
What is great. Somebody has to do it.

187
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,504
But you pretended to be someone who
believed in the sanctuary of marriage.

188
00:14:50,722 --> 00:14:53,574
If someone who is dedicated,
monogamous relationship.

189
00:14:53,808 --> 00:14:56,043
You do yourself
as the ideal gay man and ...

190
00:14:56,143 --> 00:14:57,911
look what's to yourself.

191
00:14:58,104 --> 00:15:00,731
You appears not to be different
than all others in this country.

192
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:03,942
You're perfect for you,
while your spouse is cheating.

193
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,337
You shouted to the world:
"Gay people can the marriage!"

194
00:15:07,572 --> 00:15:09,598
And you can not even think of yourself.

195
00:15:12,827 --> 00:15:14,352
Fuck you.

196
00:15:17,707 --> 00:15:21,166
Are you going to hide it.
Just pretend everything is okay.

197
00:15:22,712 --> 00:15:25,589
We will all do
if everything is okay ...

198
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:41,989
Hey.
- Hey ...

199
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,656
Important evening?

200
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:46,459
We shall see.

201
00:15:57,038 --> 00:15:59,055
Now it's my turn to say sorry.

202
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:02,951
It's not your fault,
not quite.

203
00:16:06,297 --> 00:16:08,290
My ex had even phoned me earlier.

204
00:16:09,008 --> 00:16:10,450
Before we ...

205
00:16:12,345 --> 00:16:14,513
changed in Krystle and Alexis?

206
00:16:16,933 --> 00:16:18,350
Who are they?

207
00:16:18,768 --> 00:16:20,736
The youth ...
No sense of the gay culture.

208
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:23,355
I know enough about the gay culture.

209
00:16:24,315 --> 00:16:26,567
<i> Did you ever
"Whatever happend to Baby Jane?" </ I>

210
00:16:27,485 --> 00:16:28,652
Yes.

211
00:16:29,362 --> 00:16:32,406
This is a TV movie about a girl
that fell into a pit, right?

212
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,992
Never mind.

213
00:16:36,327 --> 00:16:39,246
Listen, I want to make it
because I have just had such a bastard.

214
00:16:55,638 --> 00:16:57,463
What did you think?

215
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,185
Alcohol, lots of alcohol ...

216
00:17:02,645 --> 00:17:04,679
Thanks for letting me use your computer for.

217
00:17:05,565 --> 00:17:08,150
I can not believe my laptop
forgot.

218
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:11,486
No problem,
just not at my watch porn.

219
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:14,489
Porn on a laptop?

220
00:17:14,824 --> 00:17:16,491
Never thought of that.

221
00:17:22,081 --> 00:17:24,666
I am really nailed to the cross.

222
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:26,893
The Republicans?

223
00:17:27,086 --> 00:17:28,862
Of course, that was to be expected.

224
00:17:28,962 --> 00:17:31,965
But a slap in the face of the
gay media, since I had not counted on.

225
00:17:33,217 --> 00:17:34,509
Like what?

226
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:40,764
This gay news site says
I gave all the opposition ...

227
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,811
what they need to say
that the gay marriage can not handle.

228
00:17:45,188 --> 00:17:47,272
That sounds familiar.
- Shut up.

229
00:17:48,316 --> 00:17:50,092
The hearing of a foreign
is a ...

230
00:17:50,192 --> 00:17:52,277
but to read it
as the full printed.

231
00:17:54,447 --> 00:17:56,281
Stupid gay blogs.

232
00:17:57,158 --> 00:18:01,078
One moment you're the hero
and following the pariah.

233
00:18:01,412 --> 00:18:02,871
So is that it is.

234
00:18:02,971 --> 00:18:07,626
I gave them exclusive interviews, photos,
everything.

235
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:12,531
All they needed to get people to
persuade it to accept gay marriage.

236
00:18:12,631 --> 00:18:14,841
And they turn against me
at the first opportunity.

237
00:18:15,134 --> 00:18:16,926
Surprised you serious?

238
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:20,330
Journalists love scandals.
And even more gay journalists.

239
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,749
Yeah, but you'd think
they at least make an effort ...

240
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:24,935
to the community and its leaders
to support.

241
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,146
So you're a leader.

242
00:18:31,818 --> 00:18:34,995
Yes ... I am.

243
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,289
And I'm proud.

244
00:18:40,827 --> 00:18:42,577
Let's drink to leaders.

245
00:18:54,215 --> 00:18:56,216
At that level you're no different than me.

246
00:19:01,264 --> 00:19:02,705
What do you mean?

247
00:19:02,932 --> 00:19:05,016
There is a public image of you
where you need to answer.

248
00:19:05,268 --> 00:19:07,377
Everyone expects that you're perfect ...

249
00:19:07,477 --> 00:19:09,563
that you meet the image
that they have of you.

250
00:19:10,022 --> 00:19:13,333
Yeah, but you can not meet everyone's
expectations.

251
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:14,826
Not always.

252
00:19:14,944 --> 00:19:17,020
But if you do not,
they turn against you.

253
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,755
Yes we can ...

254
00:19:21,868 --> 00:19:24,786
I've read about you, you know ...
in the press.

255
00:19:25,663 --> 00:19:27,080
Really?

256
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,631
Yes, really.

257
00:19:28,749 --> 00:19:30,950
You also get mail when you are in the closet.

258
00:19:32,128 --> 00:19:34,954
And it's clear that you really believe in
to fight for our rights.

259
00:19:35,214 --> 00:19:37,290
Yeah, whatever that may be worth
these days.

260
00:19:37,592 --> 00:19:39,509
That's worth a lot.

261
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,331
And I always get angry when people in the
gay community criticize ...

262
00:19:44,432 --> 00:19:46,600
because you would fight for a
in their lost cause.

263
00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:50,295
Or if they say you better money can
funds for AIDS research ...

264
00:19:50,396 --> 00:19:51,897
or you can fight better
against discriminatory laws ...

265
00:19:52,398 --> 00:19:54,307
instead of fighting
for equality of marriage.

266
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:56,776
What are you saying?

267
00:19:56,903 --> 00:19:58,945
I've never seen tricks
to the critics.

268
00:19:59,989 --> 00:20:01,915
You seem totally focused
on your mission.

269
00:20:02,115 --> 00:20:04,150
This is the person you should show.

270
00:20:04,785 --> 00:20:08,235
But undoubtedly there are also days
you might want to scream ...

271
00:20:08,371 --> 00:20:11,124
to those bastards that you
just want to attack.

272
00:20:11,751 --> 00:20:13,660
Whether you feel like your fight
complete to give.

273
00:20:13,836 --> 00:20:15,111
Yes, right?

274
00:20:20,134 --> 00:20:22,452
Everyone has their own purpose.

275
00:20:22,552 --> 00:20:25,247
And everybody thinks that its purpose is much
is more important than that of another.

276
00:20:25,347 --> 00:20:26,640
But you can not say
in public.

277
00:20:28,601 --> 00:20:32,354
Everyone fights for the same ...
'Pink dollar, "so ...

278
00:20:32,855 --> 00:20:35,440
Yes, it's frustrating.

279
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,968
And now you sit still
with your own personal problems.

280
00:20:38,068 --> 00:20:40,320
And I'm not asking you what happened.
That's nothing to me.

281
00:20:41,322 --> 00:20:42,889
You are the only one.

282
00:20:42,989 --> 00:20:45,892
And I understand how difficult it must be
every day to go out ...

283
00:20:45,993 --> 00:20:49,537
and the virtue of marriage to speak,
while you have it so hard.

284
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,750
You have no idea.

285
00:20:55,127 --> 00:20:56,636
For me it is just as.

286
00:20:56,837 --> 00:21:00,415
I always have that soap opera star,
every minute as I appear in public.

287
00:21:00,716 --> 00:21:04,928
I have the series representation and the joy
to be part of a super torque.

288
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,622
Super Couples are stupid
if you see them during the day.

289
00:21:07,722 --> 00:21:09,499
I know all of this.

290
00:21:10,142 --> 00:21:12,919
But that's the role I play,
in public anyway.

291
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:15,981
Home here or am I just Graham.

292
00:21:16,732 --> 00:21:20,276
An insecure actor. Someone more
will then play in a soap.

293
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:24,656
Someone who always gets the notes
production that he must shine on TV.

294
00:21:25,908 --> 00:21:28,852
Someone who values ??his career
and in his spare time ...

295
00:21:28,952 --> 00:21:30,870
and who knows that it is important to both
to be kept separate.

296
00:21:32,248 --> 00:21:34,690
Would not it be great
if you could have two roles merge?

297
00:21:36,377 --> 00:21:38,712
To be yourself 24 hours at 24?

298
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:44,509
Frankly, I would not like to live.

299
00:21:45,386 --> 00:21:46,978
And I'm not alone.

300
00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:50,724
So-called 'normal people'
are also different in the office than at home.

301
00:21:51,225 --> 00:21:53,192
So we survive.

302
00:21:53,394 --> 00:21:55,295
So when people like me say ...

303
00:21:55,395 --> 00:21:59,090
people like you
out of the closet should come ...

304
00:21:59,191 --> 00:22:00,800
is the same as when you
against an accountant says ...

305
00:22:00,901 --> 00:22:03,903
that all his customers need to know
that he loves SM ...

306
00:22:04,196 --> 00:22:07,180
or that he loves knitting
or that he is an alcoholic.

307
00:22:07,366 --> 00:22:10,185
Wait, you compare a gay to be
Well with an alcoholic too?

308
00:22:10,286 --> 00:22:11,486
No ...

309
00:22:12,496 --> 00:22:14,138
Well ... yes!

310
00:22:14,373 --> 00:22:17,375
In the sense that it is something
that most see it as something private.

311
00:22:18,252 --> 00:22:21,300
Something they do with anyone else
sharing, unless they want to.

312
00:22:22,339 --> 00:22:24,574
People can not live
without their private lives ...

313
00:22:24,674 --> 00:22:26,968
their secrets and their fantasies.

314
00:22:27,428 --> 00:22:31,070
What you get to see people on the surface,
is but a fraction of who they are.

315
00:22:32,933 --> 00:22:35,560
And if you find better public figure
than the private person?

316
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,563
Then you need more wine.

317
00:22:43,444 --> 00:22:45,853
Speaking about the clash between
your public and your private life ...

318
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,697
I got an offer
got a job.

319
00:22:48,032 --> 00:22:49,323
Really?

320
00:22:49,783 --> 00:22:51,651
Yes, even for the lead.

321
00:22:51,994 --> 00:22:53,452
Which?

322
00:22:54,163 --> 00:22:57,040
<i> Porn.
It's called "The Hunk & The Restless." </ I>

323
00:22:59,126 --> 00:23:00,835
And who would you be?

324
00:23:08,219 --> 00:23:10,077
Do you think you will get home safely?

325
00:23:11,222 --> 00:23:12,538
Probably.

326
00:23:19,021 --> 00:23:20,496
You're there.

327
00:23:21,023 --> 00:23:22,565
Sleep well.

328
00:23:23,817 --> 00:23:25,476
Thanks for the wine.

329
00:23:25,861 --> 00:23:27,519
When you want ...

330
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,922
To rest.

331
00:23:35,913 --> 00:23:37,363
To rest.

332
00:23:46,006 --> 00:23:49,592
I'm not here first public statement
on passing through a video on the internet.

333
00:23:50,302 --> 00:23:52,745
There's just say all problems
started, remember?

334
00:23:52,845 --> 00:23:55,014
Good, good, good.
And Twat?

335
00:23:55,432 --> 00:23:56,466
The what?

336
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:00,400
The Twat! If they have a short statement
passing through the Internet.

337
00:24:01,355 --> 00:24:02,930
I do not think that's so hot.

338
00:24:03,107 --> 00:24:04,824
No matter, the youth is crazy.

339
00:24:05,067 --> 00:24:07,035
If I do this, I want to do well.

340
00:24:07,235 --> 00:24:08,803
That I owe my fans.

341
00:24:08,904 --> 00:24:11,010
You are your fans owe nothing.
They are what you owe.

342
00:24:11,035 --> 00:24:12,900
They owe you their support.

343
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,875
And a national tabloid?

344
00:24:15,411 --> 00:24:17,228
Not big enough for a cover.

345
00:24:17,496 --> 00:24:18,888
A soap-sheet?

346
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,020
I doubt still interested ...

347
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:23,610
the cover to devote
to an actor who was fired.

348
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,678
The TV company has too many
control over those magazines.

349
00:24:25,878 --> 00:24:28,881
Let me just explain something to you ...
- If someone once did.

350
00:24:29,091 --> 00:24:31,955
<i> This is no ordinary
coming-out story. </ i>

351
00:24:32,056 --> 00:24:35,096
You are now
continuously from the cabinet.

352
00:24:35,889 --> 00:24:38,900
But not everyone is filmed while he
had sex with another man.

353
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,100
That makes you a villain,
a pervert, a sex addict ...

354
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:45,106
in their eyes,
not in mine, Boobula.

355
00:24:45,482 --> 00:24:46,632
What should I do?

356
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:49,132
Well, I have something for you to find
in England ...

357
00:24:49,153 --> 00:24:50,905
where nobody cares
with whom the actors sleep.

358
00:24:50,946 --> 00:24:53,489
But no dispensation from American press,
if you wanted to mean.

359
00:24:54,408 --> 00:24:57,310
There is a gay site ...

360
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,871
referred to one or other
trivial pop star.

361
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,107
And they want to do an interview,
but only if it is exclusive.

362
00:25:03,207 --> 00:25:04,651
Is that our best option?

363
00:25:04,751 --> 00:25:07,211
When people see you,
make them for you while you ...

364
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:10,757
you know,
anally penetrated.

365
00:25:11,884 --> 00:25:14,635
Bernie, use those words
Please never more.

366
00:25:14,845 --> 00:25:16,136
As you wish.

367
00:25:17,431 --> 00:25:19,807
What if ...
- What if what?

368
00:25:21,351 --> 00:25:24,187
What if we Parkers name drop?

369
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,630
Graham, think 's after what you say.

370
00:25:26,899 --> 00:25:30,032
A. You come across vindictive.
B. Would you do that to him?

371
00:25:31,487 --> 00:25:33,228
No, indeed not.

372
00:25:33,989 --> 00:25:35,231
What then?

373
00:25:35,491 --> 00:25:39,410
Bernie, how much I enjoy
of these early phones ...

374
00:25:40,037 --> 00:25:42,071
You need me here just to think about.

375
00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:43,714
I'll call you soon.

376
00:26:08,398 --> 00:26:09,548
Hello?

377
00:26:11,818 --> 00:26:14,237
You really need to stop
with me always calling.

378
00:26:15,948 --> 00:26:17,973
No, I'm not with anyone else.

379
00:26:18,283 --> 00:26:20,167
That was you, remember?

380
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,090
Listen ...

381
00:26:23,391 --> 00:26:26,150
I took the blame so no
would know why we really are apart.

382
00:26:26,165 --> 00:26:27,991
What do you want from me?

383
00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:32,421
No ... No, no.

384
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,190
Talk to my lawyer.

385
00:27:22,723 --> 00:27:24,407
I give up!

386
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,745
Good morning.

387
00:27:31,231 --> 00:27:32,406
Good morning.

388
00:27:33,525 --> 00:27:35,258
Sleep well?

389
00:27:35,819 --> 00:27:37,236
Very good.

390
00:27:38,572 --> 00:27:39,938
Coffee?

391
00:27:46,621 --> 00:27:48,038
I'd love to.

392
00:27:56,798 --> 00:27:58,758
That was the best coffee ever.

393
00:28:03,013 --> 00:28:04,872
Did not you prefer decaffeinated?

394
00:28:05,098 --> 00:28:06,406
Absolutely not!

395
00:28:10,604 --> 00:28:12,412
Shall we 's drink?

396
00:28:27,996 --> 00:28:30,322
This was definitely not your sex video.

397
00:28:32,501 --> 00:28:35,044
They always say that I
such a versatile actor.

398
00:28:35,504 --> 00:28:38,097
Yeah, tell that.

399
00:28:38,924 --> 00:28:40,900
Would the manager heard us?

400
00:28:42,219 --> 00:28:44,762
Honey, your manager
Beverly Hills has heard about us.

401
00:28:45,305 --> 00:28:48,320
It is not the first time he
two men working together properly.

402
00:28:48,809 --> 00:28:50,810
Yes, that's true.

403
00:28:51,686 --> 00:28:54,605
Hence they condoms and lube
lay in the rooms.

404
00:28:55,398 --> 00:28:57,333
That was always so nice here.

405
00:29:00,111 --> 00:29:01,586
Are you serious?

406
00:29:12,958 --> 00:29:14,950
Could me and my ex
busy ever heard?

407
00:29:16,002 --> 00:29:18,128
If it also so toeging,
then probably.

408
00:29:19,339 --> 00:29:21,507
We thought we were so careful.

409
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,926
We were never together
to public events.

410
00:29:24,427 --> 00:29:26,261
We lived separately.

411
00:29:27,264 --> 00:29:30,224
This was one of the few places
where we could be ourselves.

412
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,769
What happens in Palm Springs
remains in Palm Springs?

413
00:29:34,813 --> 00:29:35,771
Something like that, yes.

414
00:29:39,901 --> 00:29:41,935
We have seen good times.

415
00:29:45,949 --> 00:29:48,984
How long have you been together?
If I may ask ...

416
00:29:49,494 --> 00:29:50,936
Five years.

417
00:29:53,081 --> 00:29:54,681
What happened?

418
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:56,691
Life, I guess ...

419
00:29:58,712 --> 00:30:02,972
Well, that's not true.
It started when he was discharged.

420
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,725
By who?
- The series.

421
00:30:06,011 --> 00:30:07,786
Was he in your series?

422
00:30:07,971 --> 00:30:09,888
Did I not tell you?

423
00:30:10,265 --> 00:30:11,765
No ...

424
00:30:13,852 --> 00:30:15,693
Who was it?

425
00:30:17,397 --> 00:30:19,106
Will you not tell?

426
00:30:19,858 --> 00:30:21,608
Our little secret.

427
00:30:25,155 --> 00:30:27,614
It was my brother.
- What?

428
00:30:28,658 --> 00:30:32,102
Parker Ryland.
That's not his real name.

429
00:30:34,831 --> 00:30:36,849
Graham Windsor is your real name is?

430
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:38,759
Sadly though.

431
00:30:38,918 --> 00:30:41,970
I think my parents wanted
I would be beaten at school.

432
00:30:49,471 --> 00:30:51,421
I can not believe ...

433
00:30:53,767 --> 00:30:57,853
you had sex with the man
that your brother was playing.

434
00:30:58,897 --> 00:31:00,689
My twin brother.

435
00:31:01,149 --> 00:31:02,407
Pardon?

436
00:31:02,734 --> 00:31:05,277
He played my identical
twin brother.

437
00:31:07,572 --> 00:31:09,531
And how did that exactly work?

438
00:31:10,367 --> 00:31:13,309
Well, first I played two brothers,
but that was I was sitting.

439
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:15,354
So the writers sent
one of my characters ...

440
00:31:15,454 --> 00:31:18,582
to a fire in the jungle of Peru,
where he was looking for our mother and ...

441
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,710
the plastic surgeons did not
what he looked like, so ...

442
00:31:22,462 --> 00:31:24,446
They found easily another person?

443
00:31:24,714 --> 00:31:27,633
5 inches shorter and 5 years younger.

444
00:31:29,052 --> 00:31:31,036
That was never really explained.

445
00:31:31,805 --> 00:31:35,657
Anyway ...

446
00:31:38,019 --> 00:31:43,315
he was fired, I was promoted
and a better storyline ...

447
00:31:43,691 --> 00:31:45,634
and he received no other offers.

448
00:31:47,821 --> 00:31:49,662
That must have been difficult.

449
00:31:50,323 --> 00:31:55,369
Very difficult. Everything went wrong then
and eventually we broke up.

450
00:31:56,204 --> 00:31:58,280
It is now six months ago.

451
00:32:05,797 --> 00:32:07,731
Do you think he leaked the video?

452
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:12,177
Who else?

453
00:32:13,847 --> 00:32:15,321
Are you sure?

454
00:32:17,016 --> 00:32:19,059
What happened, happened.

455
00:32:21,604 --> 00:32:23,572
Want some coffee?

456
00:32:25,316 --> 00:32:27,075
I think the filters are.

457
00:32:27,277 --> 00:32:29,144
Then we have to improvise.

458
00:32:45,336 --> 00:32:48,013
I'm so sorry ...
I'm so sorry.

459
00:32:48,213 --> 00:32:50,556
There no one answered when I knocked.
- No problem.

460
00:32:50,632 --> 00:32:54,011
I brought new towels.
And you just need one.

461
00:32:54,846 --> 00:32:55,954
Thank you.

462
00:32:56,097 --> 00:32:58,073
Can I get you anything else?

463
00:32:58,725 --> 00:32:59,991
Hey!

464
00:33:01,352 --> 00:33:03,769
You seem to have everything you need.
- Can I have one?

465
00:33:04,981 --> 00:33:06,973
Well, then I'll go.

466
00:33:07,275 --> 00:33:09,568
Let me know
if you need anything else.

467
00:33:10,778 --> 00:33:11,800
There is something ...

468
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:14,710
Learn more condoms and lubricant,
I get it. How soon?

469
00:33:14,805 --> 00:33:16,607
Now.
- Of course.

470
00:33:16,909 --> 00:33:18,100
And ...

471
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:27,861
Yes, there is a shop in the city
who specializes in such things.

472
00:33:27,961 --> 00:33:29,879
They have everything you want.

473
00:33:34,677 --> 00:33:36,144
What did you ask him now?

474
00:33:36,346 --> 00:33:38,163
What we talked about earlier.

475
00:33:39,182 --> 00:33:42,100
You know, do not you
we were talking about ...

476
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:44,945
I have one of these in my room.

477
00:33:45,647 --> 00:33:47,113
Really?

478
00:33:47,315 --> 00:33:48,665
Come on.

479
00:33:49,692 --> 00:33:51,809
Not true.
- Well true.

480
00:33:52,362 --> 00:33:54,054
But he is one of the largest
actors ever.

481
00:33:54,154 --> 00:33:56,490
Please ... He is one of the largest
fagots ever.

482
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:59,076
Why nobody knows him?

483
00:33:59,786 --> 00:34:01,186
Why do I not love him?

484
00:34:01,286 --> 00:34:04,298
Because they do not want to know,
the fans anyway.

485
00:34:04,498 --> 00:34:06,541
He is discreet and macho.

486
00:34:08,044 --> 00:34:10,036
Well, not so macho
if you think about it.

487
00:34:12,131 --> 00:34:14,040
And how do you know him?

488
00:34:15,259 --> 00:34:17,386
It is an open secret in the industry.

489
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:20,639
And start the hell not
about all those secret queers.

490
00:34:21,015 --> 00:34:22,373
No, you know.

491
00:34:22,934 --> 00:34:24,767
Everyone knows it.

492
00:34:25,186 --> 00:34:27,187
The players know it,
the producers know it ...

493
00:34:28,022 --> 00:34:29,306
And the public?

494
00:34:29,482 --> 00:34:32,492
Who believe everything the pr.
the TV station tells them.

495
00:34:33,236 --> 00:34:38,015
I had three real engagements, invented
and made public by the TV station.

496
00:34:38,115 --> 00:34:40,099
All about the image to protect.

497
00:34:40,451 --> 00:34:43,236
But they want themselves
good looking actors, right?

498
00:34:43,538 --> 00:34:47,630
Young, good looking actors are
for the media and for extra gay audience.

499
00:34:48,334 --> 00:34:52,202
But when I fixed values
is anyone still interested.

500
00:34:52,254 --> 00:34:54,197
You're not that old?

501
00:34:57,426 --> 00:35:01,000
In the series are my children as old
that they themselves already have children.

502
00:35:01,264 --> 00:35:03,890
I'm forty and I have three grandchildren
in the series.

503
00:35:04,392 --> 00:35:06,292
Well, I did anyway.

504
00:35:06,727 --> 00:35:08,528
No chance that your job is still
back?

505
00:35:08,813 --> 00:35:10,188
No.

506
00:35:10,565 --> 00:35:12,390
Why did not you process
filed against them?

507
00:35:12,567 --> 00:35:14,292
Moral clause.

508
00:35:14,402 --> 00:35:16,311
They did not fire me
because I'm gay.

509
00:35:21,075 --> 00:35:23,226
They fired you
for the sake of sex video.

510
00:35:23,326 --> 00:35:25,295
What actually everyone
can happen ...

511
00:35:25,788 --> 00:35:27,739
gay or straight, male or female ...

512
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:30,575
They have in fact already someone else
for my role.

513
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,051
That was quick.

514
00:35:32,211 --> 00:35:34,546
They use someone else temporarily
for a few days ...

515
00:35:35,047 --> 00:35:38,425
and they leave a big name show up
of a series that last year stopped.

516
00:35:39,594 --> 00:35:42,996
The irony is that with many more men
West Hollywood then I slept.

517
00:35:47,018 --> 00:35:48,951
That did not sound quite right.

518
00:35:50,271 --> 00:35:52,180
It sounded very good.

519
00:35:56,068 --> 00:35:57,435
Good morning.

520
00:36:03,242 --> 00:36:04,809
What are you doing?

521
00:36:07,747 --> 00:36:09,197
Put that thing away.

522
00:36:09,248 --> 00:36:12,417
What? The camera of this thing?

523
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,728
The camera, asshole.

524
00:36:14,962 --> 00:36:17,805
If you mean a direction would indicate
I'll be right.

525
00:36:21,052 --> 00:36:23,100
Good morning, fans.

526
00:36:23,212 --> 00:36:27,874
This is Ryland and Graham Parker
Windsor of your favorite TV series.

527
00:36:27,974 --> 00:36:29,317
Hold on.

528
00:36:51,999 --> 00:36:53,875
Say 'hi' to your fans, Graham.

529
00:37:00,675 --> 00:37:02,650
There's not really a tape in, huh?

530
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,821
Do you really want to do?

531
00:37:15,314 --> 00:37:17,239
Who is to know?

532
00:37:17,441 --> 00:37:19,434
Erase it again afterwards?

533
00:37:20,611 --> 00:37:22,629
After we have seen it a few times.

534
00:37:34,166 --> 00:37:35,991
You like that?

535
00:37:36,961 --> 00:37:40,378
You know I like it.
Shut up and fuck me.

536
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:59,515
You refused your partner in the video
to be identified.

537
00:37:59,733 --> 00:38:00,992
Indeed.

538
00:38:01,152 --> 00:38:02,334
Why?

539
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:03,970
What do you care?

540
00:38:04,071 --> 00:38:06,005
Well ...
- Exactly what I thought.

541
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,876
I ask you, not what you have in your bedroom
performs or with whom you do it.

542
00:38:10,077 --> 00:38:12,220
Why should I answer questions
about my private life?

543
00:38:12,913 --> 00:38:14,680
Because you're famous.

544
00:38:24,658 --> 00:38:26,425
Here I best to just touch.

545
00:38:26,635 --> 00:38:29,012
On a bathrobe two sizes
too big for you?

546
00:38:29,597 --> 00:38:32,415
Indeed, one size ...
fits like a rod on a pig.

547
00:38:33,184 --> 00:38:35,167
Too many jokes, too little time.

548
00:38:35,769 --> 00:38:38,611
I meant this.
- This did not only owe me.

549
00:38:38,898 --> 00:38:41,182
Alex has made the coffee
and bought sandwiches.

550
00:38:41,442 --> 00:38:43,450
I poured the juice.

551
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,700
Not.

552
00:38:45,887 --> 00:38:48,323
This ...
Outdoor seating breakfast.

553
00:38:49,116 --> 00:38:52,527
I know. It seems that the second
season of "Dallas".

554
00:38:55,289 --> 00:38:56,672
Tells you nothing?

555
00:38:56,999 --> 00:38:58,240
No.

556
00:38:58,959 --> 00:39:00,356
How old are you again?

557
00:39:00,502 --> 00:39:03,763
Old enough to know that I am home
outside wants to eat, as here.

558
00:39:04,173 --> 00:39:06,933
Have you any patio or garden
to your home in L.A.?

559
00:39:07,217 --> 00:39:09,243
No, it's an apartment.

560
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:11,754
In West Hollywood?

561
00:39:14,141 --> 00:39:16,074
Guilty ...
- I knew it.

562
00:39:16,142 --> 00:39:18,353
Hey, I need to be where the action is.

563
00:39:20,147 --> 00:39:22,865
You live firmly in the Hollywood Hills.

564
00:39:23,025 --> 00:39:25,992
Well, what?
- Typical actors.

565
00:39:26,028 --> 00:39:30,490
All your money on big houses
and fast cars.

566
00:39:31,158 --> 00:39:34,060
Most of my money I
actually to expensive takeaway ...

567
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,946
I eat for my huge TV,
while I'm looking to DVDs.

568
00:39:38,582 --> 00:39:40,500
How many gay movies you have in your collection?

569
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:45,000
Not much.
- Of course.

570
00:39:45,088 --> 00:39:47,974
People like you are too afraid to gay movies
in their rack already.

571
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:51,678
Someone had better at thinking you ...
"Oh, a gay '.

572
00:39:52,179 --> 00:39:53,513
<i> I 'Brokeback Mountain'. </ i>

573
00:39:54,014 --> 00:39:56,606
<i> Honey, please!
My grandmother 'Brokeback Mountain'. </ I>

574
00:39:57,559 --> 00:39:59,919
Have you gay magazines
lie on your side table?

575
00:40:02,731 --> 00:40:05,391
Typically, but not really surprising.

576
00:40:05,984 --> 00:40:08,861
Apparently nobody reads it
gay publications.

577
00:40:09,196 --> 00:40:13,799
Most go bankrupt
together with the gay bookstores.

578
00:40:14,034 --> 00:40:15,835
Many gay men have gone bankrupt.

579
00:40:16,036 --> 00:40:19,997
We are sorry. I remember that I secretly gay
bookstores went, when I was young.

580
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:22,291
Before I became a professional actor.

581
00:40:22,793 --> 00:40:26,746
I leafed through the magazines like
to about famous gay people to read.

582
00:40:27,005 --> 00:40:28,923
When there were not so many.

583
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:31,859
And now they read about you.

584
00:40:33,595 --> 00:40:35,021
Oh, God ...

585
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:40,526
I'm working on an article about why
gay publications fail.

586
00:40:40,894 --> 00:40:43,229
Really? Where do you publish?

587
00:40:44,148 --> 00:40:45,480
Funny.

588
00:40:45,773 --> 00:40:48,500
Do you want to hear my theory or not?
- Yeah, you know.

589
00:40:48,776 --> 00:40:51,537
It's not the economy
and certainly not to a lack of stories.

590
00:40:51,905 --> 00:40:54,860
I believe the gay media
die ...

591
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,777
because they have turned their backs
to the community.

592
00:40:58,662 --> 00:41:00,588
Previously they published
real gay stories.

593
00:41:00,747 --> 00:41:05,785
Profiles of gay artists, actors, musicians,
writers, leader figures, whatever.

594
00:41:05,961 --> 00:41:10,989
And when they realized
that they had sold more advertising ...

595
00:41:11,189 --> 00:41:13,968
if they are on the cover straight up.

596
00:41:14,845 --> 00:41:16,837
A straight ally
with the community.

597
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:19,465
And then came the divas.

598
00:41:19,766 --> 00:41:20,766
The divas?

599
00:41:20,866 --> 00:41:23,586
Yeah, who would want to read about
an emerging gay singer ...

600
00:41:23,686 --> 00:41:26,244
if you can read a profile of ...

601
00:41:26,645 --> 00:41:29,375
Madonna and Vanessa Williams?

602
00:41:29,693 --> 00:41:31,410
I think Vanessa Williams super.

603
00:41:31,528 --> 00:41:33,245
Yes, all of us.

604
00:41:34,281 --> 00:41:36,800
But that's not the point.
The point is that ...

605
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:42,340
when the national gay publications
stopped really gay men to profile ...

606
00:41:42,623 --> 00:41:44,716
they will no longer were
a weekday tabloid ...

607
00:41:44,816 --> 00:41:46,700
same content offered as others.

608
00:41:46,877 --> 00:41:49,128
Besides the pictures of handsome models
in their underwear.

609
00:41:49,796 --> 00:41:54,800
Yes, indeed ...
Here, we are of course.

610
00:41:57,304 --> 00:42:03,200
But the worst is that we accept,
and we love it.

611
00:42:04,645 --> 00:42:08,648
We beg to report
Kylie's last tour ...

612
00:42:10,525 --> 00:42:15,821
rather more reviews on
latest book by Christopher Rise. Yet?

613
00:42:16,323 --> 00:42:19,467
It is no wonder that all our gay
bookshops go.

614
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,894
You give Kylie Minogue is to blame for
that gay bookstores closing?

615
00:42:21,994 --> 00:42:25,831
No, no.
Well ... yes, in a sense.

616
00:42:26,917 --> 00:42:32,380
Look, if our own media stores
really gay books would promote ...

617
00:42:32,415 --> 00:42:37,843
and gay movies and gay musicians ...
then people would buy their work.

618
00:42:38,887 --> 00:42:41,180
Everyone supports his own people.

619
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:43,582
Except us.

620
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,919
What do you think they will write about me?

621
00:42:50,941 --> 00:42:54,635
Either you are a pathetic
not dare to come out of the closet ...

622
00:42:54,735 --> 00:42:58,698
either a bad role model
because you had unprotected sex.

623
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,030
We had long been a solid relationship.

624
00:43:01,034 --> 00:43:03,803
They do not care.
They saw you fucking without condom ...

625
00:43:03,912 --> 00:43:05,179
so you're a villain.

626
00:43:05,272 --> 00:43:09,049
I do not have to apologize because I have sex
had with my friend. - I know, I know ...

627
00:43:10,377 --> 00:43:12,203
But you have a third option.

628
00:43:13,171 --> 00:43:16,215
You become a 'professional gay'.

629
00:43:19,469 --> 00:43:22,204
What? Unfair outed
by homophobic press.

630
00:43:22,304 --> 00:43:26,626
You serves as the Grand Marshal
and Pride Parade over the country.

631
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:28,669
You come up against the double standard
in the industry.

632
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:31,130
For example, if I know
filmmaker had been ...

633
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:33,670
then gave one to which sex video.
- Right.

634
00:43:33,899 --> 00:43:36,736
And you act in a reality TV show ...

635
00:43:37,279 --> 00:43:39,271
You have someone write your memoirs.

636
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:44,243
<i> And you're doing local theater productions ...
of 'Bent'. </ i>

637
00:43:44,494 --> 00:43:46,378
Seriously? Are my options?

638
00:43:46,621 --> 00:43:50,124
I set the rules do not.
You're not Chad Allen.

639
00:43:50,417 --> 00:43:51,984
Jesus, thank you.

640
00:43:52,252 --> 00:43:53,786
You're much sexier.

641
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,420
That's better.

642
00:44:01,803 --> 00:44:03,596
Do you know the rules or of bowls?

643
00:44:04,139 --> 00:44:05,714
Are we playing?

644
00:44:05,807 --> 00:44:07,933
Play your not happy with big balls?

645
00:44:08,602 --> 00:44:09,802
And ...

646
00:44:15,609 --> 00:44:17,484
I am now playing or what?

647
00:44:19,154 --> 00:44:20,929
Yes, you won.

648
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:28,120
Hello ...
Sorry to disturb you.

649
00:44:28,622 --> 00:44:30,664
I'm going out to dinner tonight.

650
00:44:31,291 --> 00:44:33,242
In an Italian around the corner.

651
00:44:33,877 --> 00:44:35,850
You guys might want
to go?

652
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,000
Thanks, Alex, but ...

653
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:41,367
I do not think it is smart for us to
together to be seen in public.

654
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,235
I was just thinking the same thing.

655
00:44:43,386 --> 00:44:45,246
Who would you see here now?

656
00:44:45,346 --> 00:44:46,905
You'd be surprised.

657
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:48,306
Well then ...

658
00:44:50,393 --> 00:44:53,654
Maybe Trey cooks it for you,
if you ask him politely.

659
00:44:56,274 --> 00:44:58,050
Would you like to cook for me?

660
00:45:02,322 --> 00:45:03,989
I can do that.

661
00:45:10,497 --> 00:45:13,415
You follows no soaps on TV?

662
00:45:17,712 --> 00:45:19,037
Not really.

663
00:45:21,341 --> 00:45:23,475
Only when I hear that there are gay
story lines in it.

664
00:45:24,177 --> 00:45:26,044
So not really often.

665
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:32,534
Why do you ask?

666
00:45:34,104 --> 00:45:36,105
I just had to think of someone ...

667
00:45:43,905 --> 00:45:45,313
Your ex?

668
00:45:46,032 --> 00:45:51,303
No. A friend ...
A mentor, actually.

669
00:45:51,621 --> 00:45:53,538
He died last year.

670
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:56,358
Sorry.

671
00:45:57,043 --> 00:45:58,744
He was 92 years old.

672
00:45:58,962 --> 00:46:00,846
It did not really unexpected.

673
00:46:01,464 --> 00:46:03,882
He was one of the original
actors of the series.

674
00:46:03,982 --> 00:46:05,718
He was there from the very beginning.

675
00:46:07,721 --> 00:46:08,961
That is ...

676
00:46:13,727 --> 00:46:15,435
That is very long.

677
00:46:15,895 --> 00:46:17,546
Almost sixty years.

678
00:46:18,314 --> 00:46:20,081
Why did you think of him?

679
00:46:20,942 --> 00:46:22,968
When he died,
the station was worried ...

680
00:46:23,069 --> 00:46:26,363
that his death would be announced
by his partner since 55 years.

681
00:46:27,657 --> 00:46:29,474
Then he came just out of the closet.

682
00:46:30,243 --> 00:46:32,478
Seriously? Did you?

683
00:46:32,578 --> 00:46:34,571
Course. Everyone knew it.

684
00:46:35,165 --> 00:46:37,666
Another open secret
of our industry.

685
00:46:38,835 --> 00:46:40,619
But the fans did not know.

686
00:46:41,588 --> 00:46:45,074
He was one of the patriarchs of the series,
had romances with the great ladies ...

687
00:46:45,176 --> 00:46:47,176
fought against business rivals.

688
00:46:47,635 --> 00:46:50,400
He was a sounding board for the children
of his character ...

689
00:46:50,501 --> 00:46:52,881
and his grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

690
00:46:53,641 --> 00:46:55,600
Not long after I
the series started ...

691
00:46:55,601 --> 00:46:57,800
he invited me to his home
out on a dinner.

692
00:46:58,104 --> 00:47:00,138
Frankly, I was terrified.

693
00:47:01,775 --> 00:47:03,124
Why?

694
00:47:03,401 --> 00:47:05,218
Because he was a legend.

695
00:47:05,779 --> 00:47:07,738
And I had almost not
worked with him.

696
00:47:07,939 --> 00:47:09,970
I felt honored
he invited me.

697
00:47:10,386 --> 00:47:11,600
And what happened?

698
00:47:11,659 --> 00:47:14,236
I came to him,
alone, nervous ...

699
00:47:14,621 --> 00:47:18,665
He welcomed me and introduced me
his partner, Donald.

700
00:47:19,876 --> 00:47:23,003
"No questions, no hesitations,
this is my partner, Donald. '

701
00:47:24,172 --> 00:47:26,465
So he was open to people
with whom he worked.

702
00:47:30,678 --> 00:47:33,263
You wonder why there are not more
actors coming out.

703
00:47:33,681 --> 00:47:36,308
And I asked him the same question
when I got to know him better.

704
00:47:38,478 --> 00:47:40,979
Someone of that age would never
come out of the closet when he was young.

705
00:47:42,232 --> 00:47:43,465
Yet?

706
00:47:44,275 --> 00:47:46,251
No, and that's a part of it.

707
00:47:46,986 --> 00:47:48,987
But for him it was more than that.

708
00:47:50,573 --> 00:47:51,440
How?

709
00:47:51,533 --> 00:47:55,737
We talked a few years ago,
when I thought about it from the closet.

710
00:47:55,912 --> 00:47:57,345
Really?

711
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:02,000
Did you think about getting out of the closet?

712
00:48:02,669 --> 00:48:04,603
Everyone talked of course out of my head.

713
00:48:04,837 --> 00:48:07,047
And, well ... here we are.

714
00:48:11,261 --> 00:48:13,378
And what advice did the man
you given?

715
00:48:15,181 --> 00:48:18,650
"I'm perfectly happy with my life,
as it is, "he told me.

716
00:48:19,852 --> 00:48:22,354
He loved being so long
same character to play.

717
00:48:23,523 --> 00:48:26,033
He loved to be recognized
by his fans as he came out.

718
00:48:26,233 --> 00:48:28,527
But who knew only the character,
not him.

719
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,632
And that was enough for him?

720
00:48:35,743 --> 00:48:39,288
He said: "I am almost 60 years
as an actor at work.

721
00:48:39,956 --> 00:48:42,140
I am incredibly well paid
for what I do.

722
00:48:42,375 --> 00:48:45,000
And I have all the time to spend
with the love of my life ...

723
00:48:45,044 --> 00:48:46,778
and with my family in the series.

724
00:48:46,878 --> 00:48:48,805
I could not have asked for more. "

725
00:48:50,883 --> 00:48:52,784
That has always stayed with me.

726
00:49:03,062 --> 00:49:04,450
Well ...

727
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,950
He seems like a happy man.

728
00:49:10,903 --> 00:49:12,403
That was he.

729
00:49:13,239 --> 00:49:16,241
Maybe it nobody ever knew
who he was until he was dead.

730
00:49:21,581 --> 00:49:23,414
Would you like to live ...

731
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:27,753
if that whole video thing
had not happened?

732
00:49:29,756 --> 00:49:33,008
I do not know. These are different times.

733
00:49:34,635 --> 00:49:37,262
Lifetime employment security
is something of the past.

734
00:49:38,931 --> 00:49:40,515
As well as privacy.

735
00:50:38,282 --> 00:50:40,199
How's that guy that you're out?

736
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:42,910
Usually harmless.

737
00:50:54,006 --> 00:50:55,581
You're a natural.

738
00:50:56,409 --> 00:50:58,343
One of the two must have money.

739
00:50:58,845 --> 00:51:01,278
Or a giant penis.
- Or both.

740
00:51:02,348 --> 00:51:04,249
So why are you after me ...

741
00:51:06,352 --> 00:51:09,646
Funny how you rarely see gay people
dating outside their own world.

742
00:51:10,273 --> 00:51:13,191
Says the man who datete
with his own fictional twin brother.

743
00:51:15,194 --> 00:51:16,761
I mean it.

744
00:51:18,281 --> 00:51:21,722
Bears bears, teenagers with teenagers,
elderly elderly.

745
00:51:22,994 --> 00:51:24,878
And then you see such torque.

746
00:51:27,456 --> 00:51:29,399
How did your ex look like?

747
00:51:32,378 --> 00:51:35,822
What I thought he wore fixed
the same clothes.

748
00:51:35,922 --> 00:51:37,866
He saved his money.
What are you saying?

749
00:51:37,966 --> 00:51:40,719
Nothing, it's just an observation.

750
00:51:43,723 --> 00:51:45,689
They look happy.

751
00:51:47,059 --> 00:51:48,226
Yes.

752
00:51:50,229 --> 00:51:52,062
That should be fun.

753
00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:07,203
Do you mind if I get my emails still at nakijk?
- No, go ahead.

754
00:52:07,245 --> 00:52:08,663
Thank you.

755
00:52:17,757 --> 00:52:23,345
A folder named 'Parker' ...
Do you have pictures of your ex on your laptop?

756
00:52:23,596 --> 00:52:24,913
Well ...

757
00:52:25,013 --> 00:52:28,641
It's okay.
It is difficult for someone to let go.

758
00:52:29,352 --> 00:52:30,618
Right.

759
00:52:33,022 --> 00:52:35,539
Can I see what he looks like?
- No, do not.

760
00:52:38,611 --> 00:52:40,411
What is this video?

761
00:52:46,452 --> 00:52:48,336
Wait, this is your sex video.

762
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:55,994
Is that your ex?

763
00:52:56,128 --> 00:52:58,695
I can explain.
- You can see him in the video.

764
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,908
<i> This is Parker Ryland
and Graham Windsor ... </ i>

765
00:53:02,009 --> 00:53:03,802
<i> of your favorite TV series. </ i>

766
00:53:07,223 --> 00:53:08,981
You can see him.

767
00:53:10,017 --> 00:53:14,004
This is not the video on the internet.
Which was updated. This is the entire recording.

768
00:53:15,898 --> 00:53:19,198
If Parker had let him drain, why
you have the entire film than on your computer?

769
00:53:23,364 --> 00:53:25,122
Was it you?

770
00:53:25,991 --> 00:53:28,008
I can explain.
- Really?

771
00:53:28,494 --> 00:53:31,996
Can you explain why you own
sex video leaked on the internet?

772
00:53:32,206 --> 00:53:35,166
There is ... it's complicated.

773
00:53:36,377 --> 00:53:37,802
Probably.

774
00:53:44,051 --> 00:53:45,885
It was a PR stunt.

775
00:53:48,556 --> 00:53:49,880
What?

776
00:53:51,725 --> 00:53:54,102
I wanted out of the series of steps,
but they would not let me go.

777
00:53:54,854 --> 00:53:57,172
And I wanted to come out,
but that was not my manager.

778
00:53:57,273 --> 00:53:59,132
I wanted people knew who I was.

779
00:53:59,232 --> 00:54:01,425
I can not believe you're saying this.
- Do you know how hard it is ...

780
00:54:01,485 --> 00:54:03,850
in order to find other roles
if you sit in a soap?

781
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,700
And people need you so than
seriously? Really?

782
00:54:06,739 --> 00:54:08,633
I wanted to be noticed.

783
00:54:09,285 --> 00:54:11,478
I have been working for twenty years as an actor ...

784
00:54:11,578 --> 00:54:14,414
and who really knew me
until last month?

785
00:54:15,082 --> 00:54:17,942
And I thought, since gay actors
currently so in vogue ...

786
00:54:20,087 --> 00:54:22,964
Did you know the following
Neil Patrick Harris to be?

787
00:54:25,092 --> 00:54:27,760
I see myself more
as John Borrowman type.

788
00:54:28,053 --> 00:54:29,700
Why did not you just out of the closet?

789
00:54:29,721 --> 00:54:32,932
You said it yourself! Also in soaps one begins
gay actors to adopt.

790
00:54:33,267 --> 00:54:35,562
I was afraid they would let me stay
and my character gay would make.

791
00:54:35,602 --> 00:54:38,313
That would ruin everything I past
twenty years before that series did.

792
00:54:38,413 --> 00:54:41,274
Eventually they will forget the video
and only me ...

793
00:54:41,609 --> 00:54:44,777
an openly gay actor as good
a heterosexual can play as another.

794
00:54:46,572 --> 00:54:48,180
Do not fool yourself.

795
00:54:48,824 --> 00:54:52,493
They call you a fagot
once you turn your back.

796
00:54:53,787 --> 00:54:56,456
Yes? Maybe they do.

797
00:54:57,583 --> 00:55:00,920
But finally I will speak the truth and
my public and private life to flow together.

798
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,045
Since we're talking about?

799
00:55:02,055 --> 00:55:04,113
Why grind your Parker
not with you out of the closet?

800
00:55:04,213 --> 00:55:07,091
Because he did not want to, okay?
Why we broke up.

801
00:55:08,177 --> 00:55:10,993
Because I wanted out of the closet
and he did not.

802
00:55:11,972 --> 00:55:14,307
All the more reason for him outing ...

803
00:55:14,327 --> 00:55:16,317
I could not do it.
I love him.

804
00:55:16,977 --> 00:55:19,417
I will always love him,
but that is past.

805
00:55:19,438 --> 00:55:22,347
It is not the same as what we have.
- Do not pretend you care about me.

806
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:24,909
You've been lying to me
since the moment we met.

807
00:55:27,821 --> 00:55:29,397
And you're not?

808
00:55:31,659 --> 00:55:33,317
What I thought

809
00:55:37,456 --> 00:55:39,800
Judge me for what I did.
I deserve it.

810
00:55:40,623 --> 00:55:44,795
But if you're ready to give me your truth
to tell, I will waiting for you.

811
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:38,665
He's right.

812
00:56:42,229 --> 00:56:43,996
About what?

813
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,757
About telling the truth.

814
00:56:49,403 --> 00:56:51,845
You have no idea
what's going on.

815
00:56:52,906 --> 00:56:56,107
I know he cares about you.
That everyone sees.

816
00:56:56,301 --> 00:57:00,700
And you apparently to him, otherwise
you were long gone after that fight.

817
00:57:01,248 --> 00:57:02,690
Walk fuck.

818
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:07,428
No, thanks, man.
Do not be.

819
00:57:12,009 --> 00:57:15,595
Do you see? So you can not be angry,
if you still can laugh.

820
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:20,600
Why would I take advice from you?

821
00:57:21,101 --> 00:57:23,936
Because I'm gay and I
and wen there Just to.

822
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:40,953
You got me here, no time
noticed, huh?

823
00:57:43,582 --> 00:57:45,057
Course.

824
00:57:46,585 --> 00:57:47,901
You're in ...

825
00:57:49,755 --> 00:57:50,946
this.

826
00:57:51,089 --> 00:57:54,967
<i> Almost, it's that one.
I am literally 'The boy next door'. </ I>

827
00:57:55,677 --> 00:57:57,661
Sorry, I had the ...

828
00:57:58,263 --> 00:57:59,931
quite busy?

829
00:58:01,683 --> 00:58:04,101
Yes, I have several times heard.

830
00:58:06,271 --> 00:58:07,547
Since your first hug ...

831
00:58:07,647 --> 00:58:10,900
you only focus
for that man in suite # 2.

832
00:58:11,485 --> 00:58:15,100
Furthermore, have I not
so many times, I'm usually within.

833
00:58:15,489 --> 00:58:18,224
And now you tell me your story
of your lost love ...

834
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:21,485
and that despite everything still in love
believes. Blah, blah, blah ...

835
00:58:21,662 --> 00:58:24,664
That I could, but let's
in essence, okay?

836
00:58:25,082 --> 00:58:26,899
<i> 'Ricky's life, episode 101. </ i>

837
00:58:28,043 --> 00:58:30,503
I'm Rick way.

838
00:58:30,962 --> 00:58:32,237
I'm Trey.

839
00:58:32,506 --> 00:58:34,582
"Trey, Celebrity 'will tell you.

840
00:58:35,634 --> 00:58:37,343
Do you see? It is al

841
00:58:37,443 --> 00:58:39,845
My life in a nutshell:
I grew up in Kansas ...

842
00:58:40,097 --> 00:58:43,330
I moved to Los Angeles on my 18th,
have far too much partying ...

843
00:58:43,684 --> 00:58:47,003
and I was far too busy
with my appearance.

844
00:58:49,356 --> 00:58:51,190
Now you hear me say
I'm pretty good look.

845
00:58:52,192 --> 00:58:54,759
Sorry, you look pretty good.
- I know, right?

846
00:58:56,196 --> 00:58:57,930
Well, I am now thirty years ...

847
00:58:58,032 --> 00:59:00,057
I've never had a serious relationship ...

848
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:02,034
and I have skin cancer.

849
00:59:03,870 --> 00:59:06,504
I am sorry
- That's okay.

850
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:09,667
Of course it is not in order,
but everyone says it's okay.

851
00:59:10,382 --> 00:59:12,336
So remember, use your sunscreen.

852
00:59:13,255 --> 00:59:16,882
It'll be okay, but ...
if not ...

853
00:59:19,553 --> 00:59:22,288
Otherwise I would do anything
so someone would give me enough ...

854
00:59:22,389 --> 00:59:26,358
to come after me to tell me the truth
to tell you about something that hurts me.

855
00:59:26,601 --> 00:59:28,126
It is not so easy.

856
00:59:28,228 --> 00:59:31,439
No, indeed. It is easy
to say 'I love you'.

857
00:59:32,149 --> 00:59:34,775
It is difficult to say
"I messed up, I've hurt you. '

858
00:59:35,068 --> 00:59:37,077
"But, damn,
I still love you. '

859
00:59:42,576 --> 00:59:44,900
That they had a pillow
embroidery or so.

860
00:59:46,788 --> 00:59:49,582
You're right, that they had to do.

861
00:59:52,252 --> 00:59:56,343
Well, I gotta go.
Tonight my dinner with Andre.

862
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,474
Great movie.

863
00:59:58,717 --> 01:00:01,560
What movie? I'm just eating
with my friend Andre.

864
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:04,180
He gave me before the best drug.

865
01:00:06,433 --> 01:00:07,974
The good old days ...

866
01:00:10,103 --> 01:00:13,140
Remember: if you do something
to tell you, do it ...

867
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,948
before it is too late.

868
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,801
An atoning sacrifice.

869
01:00:35,462 --> 01:00:37,012
I'm busy.

870
01:00:39,299 --> 01:00:40,632
What?

871
01:00:41,968 --> 01:00:44,762
I'm working on a statement to the press,
if you would like to know.

872
01:00:45,138 --> 01:00:46,847
My big outing.

873
01:00:49,601 --> 01:00:51,009
Good for you.

874
01:00:52,437 --> 01:00:54,980
I mean it. I'm happy
you that step.

875
01:00:57,317 --> 01:00:59,985
'Coming out' ...
I sound like a southerner.

876
01:01:02,447 --> 01:01:04,657
This is a role that I give you
ever want to see play.

877
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:08,295
Can I come in?

878
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,612
I want to tell you the truth
about my divorce.

879
01:01:28,098 --> 01:01:30,015
I've read them all
on the Internet.

880
01:01:33,019 --> 01:01:35,879
You should know that you do not
must believe what you read.

881
01:01:36,982 --> 01:01:38,790
Have you not deceived him?

882
01:01:42,153 --> 01:01:43,996
It's more complicated than that.

883
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:54,606
You see, we were not really married.

884
01:01:55,375 --> 01:01:59,870
I mean, are legal and all, but ...

885
01:02:01,962 --> 01:02:04,366
not like you're a real marriage represents.

886
01:02:05,218 --> 01:02:07,052
I do not understand.

887
01:02:10,515 --> 01:02:12,958
It was just a marriage.

888
01:02:14,227 --> 01:02:17,170
A marriage?
What does that mean?

889
01:02:27,449 --> 01:02:30,576
I fought so many years
for the right to marry.

890
01:02:30,869 --> 01:02:36,748
And when we got just that opportunity,
for Proposition 8 was through ...

891
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:42,754
I found that I had to marry
to prove myself.

892
01:02:43,715 --> 01:02:45,298
This is unbelievable.

893
01:02:45,467 --> 01:02:47,317
How could it happen ...

894
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:52,764
as the main protagonist of the case
stood on the side?

895
01:02:53,766 --> 01:02:57,594
All others hurried to
San Francisco to get married there ...

896
01:02:57,812 --> 01:03:00,546
even though they knew that it probably
not legally would remain valid.

897
01:03:02,275 --> 01:03:04,184
I really believe in marriage.

898
01:03:05,487 --> 01:03:06,787
Really.

899
01:03:07,989 --> 01:03:09,490
And I believe ...

900
01:03:10,617 --> 01:03:13,994
that the gay community
it better than anyone.

901
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:20,333
The problem is ...

902
01:03:22,962 --> 01:03:24,087
my husband that believeth.

903
01:03:25,423 --> 01:03:26,923
Go on.

904
01:03:27,675 --> 01:03:29,576
I wonder what else is coming.

905
01:03:29,969 --> 01:03:31,895
He has fallen in love with someone ...

906
01:03:34,474 --> 01:03:36,233
and he wants to be with him.

907
01:03:40,313 --> 01:03:42,180
I suppose not blame him.

908
01:03:43,608 --> 01:03:47,577
We had no such relationship.

909
01:03:49,155 --> 01:03:52,824
We were just roommates
with additional benefits.

910
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:56,587
Financial and legal,
not sexual.

911
01:03:56,787 --> 01:03:58,705
Why does he apparent than
no longer?

912
01:03:59,332 --> 01:04:04,294
That boy that he is in love,
lives in Toronto.

913
01:04:05,672 --> 01:04:08,340
He wants to move there
and married.

914
01:04:11,344 --> 01:04:13,286
Start a new life.

915
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:16,356
I can not stop him.
I do not want.

916
01:04:16,641 --> 01:04:19,851
Why write them all
you're the one who has gone weird?

917
01:04:20,144 --> 01:04:22,362
Graham.

918
01:04:28,361 --> 01:04:32,455
I owe him so much.

919
01:04:32,865 --> 01:04:34,866
I put him in this shit
concerned.

920
01:04:35,868 --> 01:04:39,854
I could not let him blame
by the press.

921
01:04:40,915 --> 01:04:43,942
If I get the criticism over me,
then he gets no criticism.

922
01:04:44,877 --> 01:04:48,988
I know it's a stupid plan.

923
01:04:50,675 --> 01:04:53,660
But I thought that the best
solution.

924
01:04:54,012 --> 01:04:55,920
You know, for the matter ...

925
01:04:56,597 --> 01:05:00,692
You talk about the case as if it is real,
if it were a person.

926
01:05:01,728 --> 01:05:04,571
The case would have gone,
whether you're married or not.

927
01:05:06,065 --> 01:05:08,099
I thought I could make the difference.

928
01:05:08,609 --> 01:05:11,911
But all you've done,
the whole thing is ridiculous.

929
01:05:13,573 --> 01:05:15,907
Those of us
who really like to get married ...

930
01:05:16,367 --> 01:05:19,911
and yes, I would love to get married ever ...

931
01:05:20,413 --> 01:05:22,666
we turn to the deeds
of people like you.

932
01:05:22,706 --> 01:05:26,380
What do you mean?
- That we always heterosexual couples accuse ...

933
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:28,244
she married for the wrong reasons.

934
01:05:28,421 --> 01:05:32,290
Whether they were drunk in Las Vegas,
or accidentally pregnant geraakten ...

935
01:05:32,592 --> 01:05:34,000
But you ...

936
01:05:36,304 --> 01:05:39,439
What? Say it.

937
01:05:40,516 --> 01:05:42,592
You married for the attention of the press?

938
01:05:45,229 --> 01:05:47,263
Do not be a hypocrite.

939
01:05:47,899 --> 01:05:50,901
That's exactly what you did,
by that video of your release.

940
01:05:51,444 --> 01:05:53,078
That's not the same.

941
01:05:53,237 --> 01:05:55,681
People look at me with
same standard as you.

942
01:05:55,781 --> 01:05:57,429
I'm an actor, dammit!

943
01:05:57,450 --> 01:05:59,417
Everything we do revolves around publicity.

944
01:06:00,787 --> 01:06:02,353
Even this?

945
01:06:02,955 --> 01:06:05,757
No. Absolutely not.

946
01:06:07,325 --> 01:06:08,650
It is different.

947
01:06:08,850 --> 01:06:12,639
There are people who really look up to you.
You make a difference in the world.

948
01:06:13,299 --> 01:06:16,900
How can marry for publicity
good or noble?

949
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:19,938
That's not, okay?
I know now.

950
01:06:22,808 --> 01:06:25,810
And now I have the effects of wear.

951
01:06:27,188 --> 01:06:29,013
I've lost everything, Graham.

952
01:06:30,983 --> 01:06:33,568
I lost my 'technically seen'
husband, who is also my best friend.

953
01:06:35,488 --> 01:06:37,447
I lost the respect of my colleagues.

954
01:06:40,326 --> 01:06:41,759
And now you.

955
01:06:45,706 --> 01:06:47,724
Allows for you than from
you've lost me?

956
01:06:50,294 --> 01:06:52,236
Come on, you know that well enough.

957
01:06:53,553 --> 01:06:55,548
I do not know much more.

958
01:06:58,970 --> 01:07:00,636
Just go.

959
01:07:25,997 --> 01:07:27,688
What's wrong?
- Nothing.

960
01:07:36,090 --> 01:07:38,950
That's my 'public face'
Graham where it always has.

961
01:07:39,050 --> 01:07:42,357
You ask what's wrong and I
answer automatically with 'nothing' ...

962
01:07:42,389 --> 01:07:44,347
as you know well enough
that there is something wrong.

963
01:07:45,391 --> 01:07:47,517
You should always keep your self confident face
up, huh?

964
01:07:47,727 --> 01:07:49,728
You do not have to do
you do not want.

965
01:07:50,896 --> 01:07:52,363
Not to me.

966
01:07:52,648 --> 01:07:55,600
I know I have a few more days
had reserved ...

967
01:07:56,694 --> 01:07:59,312
but I have to leave early.
Is that okay?

968
01:07:59,447 --> 01:08:01,306
Of course that's fine.

969
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:04,034
But you get no money back,
if you wanted to ask.

970
01:08:06,704 --> 01:08:08,579
Since I do not care.

971
01:08:10,124 --> 01:08:12,007
Where do you do it?

972
01:08:14,045 --> 01:08:15,519
Never mind.

973
01:08:17,323 --> 01:08:18,923
You care for him.

974
01:08:19,258 --> 01:08:22,258
That is clear.
- Not for him.

975
01:08:22,385 --> 01:08:26,723
Please, most gay men have
the maturity of teenage girls.

976
01:08:26,974 --> 01:08:29,059
And that is exactly
how he behaves.

977
01:08:30,269 --> 01:08:32,069
He'll come around.

978
01:08:34,065 --> 01:08:35,731
I think not.

979
01:08:37,276 --> 01:08:41,470
If we're 'normal' people were ...

980
01:08:41,989 --> 01:08:44,015
then we could perhaps solve this.

981
01:08:44,115 --> 01:08:48,019
So since you're a bit famous
in a certain part of society ...

982
01:08:48,119 --> 01:08:50,455
the rules of love
not for you?

983
01:08:52,792 --> 01:08:55,293
I will take the almighty Debbie Allen
quote:

984
01:08:58,088 --> 01:08:59,872
"You had big dreams ...

985
01:09:00,591 --> 01:09:04,168
and now you will learn eventually
that famous little cost. '

986
01:09:07,097 --> 01:09:08,406
Debbie who?

987
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,542
Let me not start ...

988
01:09:11,977 --> 01:09:13,769
But that's not the point.

989
01:09:17,358 --> 01:09:18,716
Why is that?

990
01:09:18,818 --> 01:09:20,944
You've worked hard to stand
where you stand today.

991
01:09:21,821 --> 01:09:24,546
You have worked hard for our
community and for our rights.

992
01:09:25,324 --> 01:09:27,784
And that is something that nobody
of you may decrease.

993
01:09:28,327 --> 01:09:30,353
But ...
- There's always a but ...

994
01:09:30,453 --> 01:09:32,539
Papa Do not interrupt
if he 's word is ...

995
01:09:33,165 --> 01:09:36,392
But if you are familiar,
people will judge you.

996
01:09:36,544 --> 01:09:39,650
Right or wrong, they will have a higher level
of responsibility you expect.

997
01:09:39,671 --> 01:09:40,972
That's not fair.

998
01:09:41,048 --> 01:09:43,266
Do you think America is built
on honesty?

999
01:09:43,842 --> 01:09:46,310
Do you think the people around honesty
give? No.

1000
01:09:47,012 --> 01:09:51,050
Finally give the people
but for one thing:

1001
01:09:52,935 --> 01:09:54,235
Sex.

1002
01:09:55,187 --> 01:09:56,495
Truth.

1003
01:09:56,689 --> 01:09:58,364
That.

1004
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:01,717
Be honest with yourself.

1005
01:10:02,903 --> 01:10:06,322
Be honest with the media
and the public.

1006
01:10:07,366 --> 01:10:09,166
But especially ...

1007
01:10:09,868 --> 01:10:11,802
Be honest with Graham.

1008
01:10:13,372 --> 01:10:15,264
Tell him what you feel for him.

1009
01:10:19,211 --> 01:10:21,020
And if he says no?

1010
01:10:22,423 --> 01:10:26,259
Send him here
and I lay it all out.

1011
01:11:07,426 --> 01:11:09,226
I fucked up.

1012
01:11:12,097 --> 01:11:13,556
What did you say?

1013
01:11:13,891 --> 01:11:17,051
I fucked up and I've hurt you,
but, damn it, I still love you.

1014
01:11:20,397 --> 01:11:23,507
It is an old saying that I've somewhere
've seen standing on a pole.

1015
01:11:24,985 --> 01:11:26,744
What was that last one?

1016
01:11:30,282 --> 01:11:32,249
I might be in love with you.

1017
01:11:34,995 --> 01:11:36,653
Good to know.

1018
01:11:47,966 --> 01:11:51,460
We are clearly not perfect.
- That is clear.

1019
01:11:51,804 --> 01:11:56,104
And unfortunately, we must consider
how our relationship ... - Our relationship?

1020
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:59,885
will affect our careers
and how the media will jump on it.

1021
01:12:01,772 --> 01:12:03,447
You're in the middle of a divorce.

1022
01:12:03,649 --> 01:12:06,550
And you stand for something bigger,
be yourself.

1023
01:12:09,029 --> 01:12:10,696
Where is it us?

1024
01:12:11,365 --> 01:12:13,340
Where would you like?

1025
01:12:18,163 --> 01:12:20,156
We will always have Palm Springs.

1026
01:12:23,669 --> 01:12:25,594
We can also have West Hollywood.

1027
01:12:30,008 --> 01:12:32,301
Perhaps, once ...

1028
01:12:35,389 --> 01:12:36,956
But not now.

1029
01:12:41,562 --> 01:12:43,362
I am leaving tomorrow.

1030
01:12:44,523 --> 01:12:45,981
So do I.

1031
01:12:49,236 --> 01:12:51,220
I see you before I leave?

1032
01:12:52,573 --> 01:12:54,298
I would like it.

1033
01:14:03,769 --> 01:14:06,437
Hey, it's me.

1034
01:14:07,064 --> 01:14:09,315
Do not hang up.
I call not to argue.

1035
01:14:12,402 --> 01:14:14,845
You stay in our house
as long as you deem necessary.

1036
01:14:14,946 --> 01:14:19,458
And I want you absolutely have to see
before you move to Toronto.

1037
01:14:23,288 --> 01:14:24,722
You know ...

1038
01:14:27,918 --> 01:14:30,769
You were my best friend since ...

1039
01:14:33,006 --> 01:14:34,882
longer than I can remember.

1040
01:14:40,138 --> 01:14:43,959
And I will not lose,
but so forget what I said earlier.

1041
01:14:46,770 --> 01:14:48,721
I blame you not know what you've done.

1042
01:14:54,945 --> 01:14:58,364
Yes, yes ... Anderson Cooper
is to puke.

1043
01:14:59,032 --> 01:15:02,559
No, no, that's okay.
It's okay.

1044
01:15:03,703 --> 01:15:06,630
I do not really care anymore
what the press says about me.

1045
01:15:08,875 --> 01:15:10,642
I know the truth.

1046
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:14,513
Yes ...

1047
01:15:16,908 --> 01:15:18,308
You too.

1048
01:15:22,848 --> 01:15:26,016
Bernie? I'm sorry to call so late,
but it is important.

1049
01:15:27,727 --> 01:15:29,895
I want you to make a statement tomorrow
for the press.

1050
01:15:30,897 --> 01:15:33,832
I want you to say that I am proud to
an openly gay, ...

1051
01:15:34,067 --> 01:15:35,568
and an openly gay actor.

1052
01:15:35,570 --> 01:15:38,362
And I apologize opposite
my fans because I was not honest with them was.

1053
01:15:41,408 --> 01:15:45,429
No. No apologies for the video.
It was wrong for him to bring.

1054
01:15:45,453 --> 01:15:48,003
But I pay every day of my life
for in one way or another.

1055
01:15:49,583 --> 01:15:51,417
I tell you the details when I see you.

1056
01:15:53,837 --> 01:15:56,171
I do not do interviews with the media.

1057
01:15:56,506 --> 01:16:00,968
We post it on my website
and that's it.

1058
01:16:02,387 --> 01:16:06,023
No exclusive interviews,
not begging for a front page story.

1059
01:16:06,349 --> 01:16:08,150
Now I'm done with it.

1060
01:16:12,063 --> 01:16:13,772
I hope I am ready.

1061
01:16:16,359 --> 01:16:17,910
We see you again?

1062
01:16:18,194 --> 01:16:19,869
Count on that.

1063
01:16:24,784 --> 01:16:30,034
Are you going to leave?
- Yeah, I gotta get back to my old business.

1064
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:31,823
So do I.

1065
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:35,252
I'm waiting for you in the car.

1066
01:16:40,550 --> 01:16:42,600
Despite what happened between you ...

1067
01:16:43,136 --> 01:16:44,470
I hope you 'll also come back.

1068
01:16:44,571 --> 01:16:45,921
Absolutely.

1069
01:16:46,222 --> 01:16:50,192
Properly. You like something easier to
in the pool than he.

1070
01:16:50,769 --> 01:16:55,330
And I know we are not alone
which make use of the pool ...

1071
01:16:55,607 --> 01:16:57,065
our naked.

1072
01:16:59,944 --> 01:17:01,854
Maybe I will change that rule.

1073
01:17:03,198 --> 01:17:04,447
Do that.

1074
01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:07,309
Best of luck.

1075
01:17:07,494 --> 01:17:08,802
Thank you.

1076
01:17:10,330 --> 01:17:11,822
I'm gonna need it.

1077
01:17:33,478 --> 01:17:34,920
This was it so?

1078
01:17:37,857 --> 01:17:40,492
You know it is not currently well
for us to be seen together.

1079
01:17:44,155 --> 01:17:45,864
Familiar faces.

1080
01:17:48,284 --> 01:17:50,502
Always worried about how something happens.

1081
01:17:54,833 --> 01:17:56,675
Perception is everything.

1082
01:18:01,798 --> 01:18:03,548
Love is everything.

1083
01:18:06,886 --> 01:18:08,812
Maybe I'm not ready.

1084
01:18:09,889 --> 01:18:11,281
Not yet.

1085
01:18:16,187 --> 01:18:18,163
When you're ready, you know
where you can reach me.

1086
01:18:28,366 --> 01:18:29,608
Well then ...

1087
01:18:36,666 --> 01:18:38,308
Will I see you again?

1088
01:18:42,108 --> 01:18:43,808
I'll see you at.

1089
01:19:40,563 --> 01:19:43,800
You know that saying that what happens
Palm Springs in Palm Springs continues ...

1090
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:45,516
Yes ...
- To hell with it.

1091
01:19:46,486 --> 01:19:49,287
I do not care what other
and thinks that you should not do.

1092
01:19:50,657 --> 01:19:51,965
You're right.

1093
01:19:52,241 --> 01:19:53,575
I'm always right.

1094
01:19:53,743 --> 01:19:55,460
What did you have in mind?

1095
01:19:56,454 --> 01:19:57,963
Going back to L.A.

1096
01:19:58,456 --> 01:20:01,730
eating in a restaurant,
maybe a movie ...

1097
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:03,835
Too old?

1098
01:20:04,003 --> 01:20:05,536
Not for me.

1099
01:20:05,922 --> 01:20:07,555
Step over but.

1100
01:20:08,508 --> 01:20:10,075
And my car?

1101
01:20:11,327 --> 01:20:13,537
I came back riding
with a big romantic gesture ...

1102
01:20:13,638 --> 01:20:15,430
and you're worried about your car?

1103
01:20:19,811 --> 01:20:21,286
Do you have room for here?

1104
01:20:21,396 --> 01:20:23,154
Throw it in the trunk.

1105
01:20:23,856 --> 01:20:26,208
Happy.
And my luggage?

1106
01:20:26,859 --> 01:20:28,310
Smarty.

1107
01:20:31,030 --> 01:20:34,723
And if there's a photographer on hold
and the pictures on the internet move?

1108
01:20:36,119 --> 01:20:38,003
Nothing would make me happier.

1109
01:21:05,314 --> 01:21:08,224
And how did it go with
Graham Windsor and Trey Reed?

1110
01:21:08,651 --> 01:21:10,134
How we went?

1111
01:21:12,447 --> 01:21:13,738
Coffee?

1112
01:21:13,906 --> 01:21:15,782
Coffee sounds good.

1113
01:21:17,076 --> 01:21:18,660
We're going to drink coffee.

1114
01:21:18,744 --> 01:21:22,113
Lots and lots of coffee.

1115
01:21:22,915 --> 01:21:24,482
And then what?

1116
01:21:24,709 --> 01:21:26,084
And then?

1117
01:21:28,838 --> 01:21:30,747
What happens next ...

1118
01:21:31,007 --> 01:21:32,857
that is not your business.

1119
01:21:34,857 --> 01:21:38,857
Translator?
Checking and editing: Goffini
