1
00:06:07,244 --> 00:06:13,292
I used to work in the old city
as a coolie.

2
00:06:14,585 --> 00:06:16,670
I used a pushcart
to carry luggage

3
00:06:16,754 --> 00:06:20,758
from the boats
that docked next to the shore.

4
00:06:23,594 --> 00:06:27,056
After the old city moved
across the river

5
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:30,976
they took down your old house,
no matter who you were.

6
00:06:31,602 --> 00:06:32,978
I had to find a place on my own

7
00:06:33,103 --> 00:06:36,482
so I built a hut
next to the shore.

8
00:06:38,776 --> 00:06:42,780
Right here where no one lives
I can plant some vegetables.

9
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:54,416
There are dots in this one.

10
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:56,252
That doesn't look so good.

11
00:06:56,335 --> 00:06:57,878
Let's move on.

12
00:07:07,054 --> 00:07:09,932
I think my family is living
a pretty good life.

13
00:07:10,641 --> 00:07:12,935
I think the downside would be

14
00:07:13,727 --> 00:07:17,022
that the house we're living in
is not in very good condition.

15
00:07:18,023 --> 00:07:20,901
But the good side
is that we have good food.

16
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,321
Because I know
that many of my classmates

17
00:07:24,488 --> 00:07:26,615
don't eat as well as we do.

18
00:07:43,591 --> 00:07:46,635
I want to go to high school
after middle school.

19
00:07:48,304 --> 00:07:49,805
High school?

20
00:07:50,806 --> 00:07:53,767
Where's the money for that?

21
00:07:55,811 --> 00:07:58,647
Many of my classmates
are going to high school.

22
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:04,570
Now we're in a socialist society
that demands knowledge.

23
00:08:04,653 --> 00:08:06,238
We need to go to high school.

24
00:08:06,322 --> 00:08:10,075
Besides, the country needs
well-educated talent.

25
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,579
So middle school is not enough.

26
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:20,085
It's not that
I don't want you to go.

27
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,756
Because if you go alone,

28
00:08:23,881 --> 00:08:27,760
do we just forget about
your little brother and sister?

29
00:08:28,594 --> 00:08:30,721
It's better
if you go and earn some money.

30
00:08:30,846 --> 00:08:32,765
Then you can afford to go later.

31
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:35,893
How can I make that much money?

32
00:08:36,018 --> 00:08:39,146
We'll see then,
if you can't make that much...

33
00:12:11,859 --> 00:12:13,986
The water will soon rise

34
00:12:14,111 --> 00:12:16,780
when the Three Gorges Dam
closes.

35
00:12:16,864 --> 00:12:19,283
I'm really worried.

36
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,165
But even if my heart worries,
there is nothing I can do.

37
00:12:26,415 --> 00:12:30,377
The Three Gorges Dam is
a national project, not private.

38
00:12:30,878 --> 00:12:35,424
The higher level of government
distributes the money.

39
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:39,970
But when the money trickles down
through the hands of the people,

40
00:12:40,054 --> 00:12:43,098
like corrupt officials,

41
00:12:43,641 --> 00:12:45,184
it just disappears.

42
00:13:20,344 --> 00:13:25,891
My father was
a minor village official

43
00:13:25,975 --> 00:13:28,477
for the old government,

44
00:13:28,853 --> 00:13:31,605
so after liberation

45
00:13:31,689 --> 00:13:34,859
he was labelled
a counter-revolutionary.

46
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,486
Our farm collective
persecuted my family,

47
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,406
so we fled from my hometown.

48
00:13:44,869 --> 00:13:52,877
My mom starved to death in
the Great Famine of the 1960s.

49
00:13:54,795 --> 00:13:57,256
It was like this
during Mao's time.

50
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:23,991
Before I think my dream
was to go to university

51
00:14:24,283 --> 00:14:25,784
and be a scientist.

52
00:14:27,745 --> 00:14:30,414
But now i think it's impossible.

53
00:14:46,096 --> 00:14:52,603
I'd say maybe let Yu Shui...

54
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:56,148
... go to work.

55
00:14:59,652 --> 00:15:02,696
I think that's what
she should do.

56
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,574
We can't make enough money
for her to study.

57
00:15:05,658 --> 00:15:08,577
How can she go to school
when she only scored 400 points?

58
00:15:08,661 --> 00:15:10,621
She can only go to work.

59
00:15:11,497 --> 00:15:14,542
Let her go to work first...

60
00:15:18,295 --> 00:15:22,091
Of course
I'm worried that

61
00:15:22,758 --> 00:15:29,348
if we let her go study
then we'll be short of money.

62
00:15:30,307 --> 00:15:35,813
But if we don't
she may blame us later.

63
00:15:39,608 --> 00:15:42,444
When the water rises and
the Three Gorges gate closes,

64
00:15:42,611 --> 00:15:44,488
where can you farm?

65
00:15:45,322 --> 00:15:47,157
You can't even have a life.

66
00:15:55,207 --> 00:15:57,334
She'll be fine
working on the boat.

67
00:15:57,501 --> 00:16:04,175
Some of her classmates
are working on the Fengdu boats.

68
00:17:27,508 --> 00:17:29,552
Let's go dance!

69
00:17:31,512 --> 00:17:32,596
Hello?

70
00:17:34,431 --> 00:17:37,142
If you have nothing to do,
Chen Bo Yu is leaving.

71
00:17:37,268 --> 00:17:39,019
Come and join us.

72
00:17:39,395 --> 00:17:43,732
The mood's not right!
Let's go to Wild Cat to dance.

73
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,823
Don't be like this,

74
00:17:51,073 --> 00:17:54,451
lingering in my mind,

75
00:17:54,702 --> 00:18:00,249
you'll find out how lonely I am.

76
00:18:02,918 --> 00:18:08,883
In my dreams, I've kissed you
a thousand times...

77
00:18:10,676 --> 00:18:13,929
When the boat managers
came to our school,

78
00:18:14,221 --> 00:18:18,893
they told me they hired me
because I have two advantages:

79
00:18:19,894 --> 00:18:23,063
First I'm good-looking,
and second I'm good at English.

80
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:30,821
I am abitious, I'm never
satisfied with what I have.

81
00:18:31,197 --> 00:18:34,825
I don't want
a flat and tasteless life.

82
00:18:46,545 --> 00:18:47,755
Tonight's about having fun.

83
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,673
Tomorrow will be about
my career.

84
00:18:49,715 --> 00:18:53,636
Career is the top priority!

85
00:18:54,011 --> 00:18:55,721
When I come back
in the New Year,

86
00:18:55,804 --> 00:18:57,765
I guarantee you guys
more fun than you can handle!

87
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,851
In my opinion
you are still students.

88
00:19:00,935 --> 00:19:06,023
Whenever you have difficulties
in your life, give me a shout.

89
00:19:06,106 --> 00:19:08,275
Soon I'll be earning
my own money.

90
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,195
I'll have more than you guys.

91
00:19:12,863 --> 00:19:14,406
Let's fill it up.

92
00:19:14,532 --> 00:19:17,993
Drink up to show that we share
the same passions, right?

93
00:19:19,537 --> 00:19:24,375
Okay, brothers forever!

94
00:19:28,045 --> 00:19:29,964
Whoa, what the fuck?

95
00:19:42,852 --> 00:19:49,984
Remember when you leave
to listen and obey.

96
00:19:50,526 --> 00:19:53,612
Otherwise, it's no good.

97
00:19:57,491 --> 00:19:59,326
Go get me some more rice.

98
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,333
Go get it for your father.

99
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:09,211
C'mon, be quick.
Be good.

100
00:20:24,185 --> 00:20:26,395
Mom, can you see me off?

101
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,230
See you off?

102
00:20:28,689 --> 00:20:29,940
There's no need.
You know your way.

103
00:20:29,982 --> 00:20:31,066
There's no need.
You know you way.

104
00:20:31,192 --> 00:20:34,361
Besides, you're a grown-up now.

105
00:20:35,112 --> 00:20:36,989
You're a middle school graduate.

106
00:20:37,072 --> 00:20:41,577
I don't read. I might take you
to the wrong boat.

107
00:20:51,712 --> 00:20:54,507
You're not a real mother!
It's not worth it!

108
00:21:04,308 --> 00:21:05,809
Stubborn temper!

109
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:08,604
Come and collect the plates!

110
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:11,190
It's your responsibility!

111
00:21:11,899 --> 00:21:13,108
Hurry up!

112
00:21:21,742 --> 00:21:23,536
You're having too much fun,

113
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:25,579
It's your turn to clean!

114
00:21:25,621 --> 00:21:29,166
Remember to
clean the table later.

115
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,168
Remember that.

116
00:21:48,227 --> 00:21:52,147
You know our family is poor.
You can't compare us to others.

117
00:21:53,732 --> 00:21:56,902
You understand
the situation, no?

118
00:22:00,322 --> 00:22:01,866
We don't even
have anything to eat.

119
00:22:01,949 --> 00:22:04,618
How can we
afford to rent a house?

120
00:22:04,952 --> 00:22:08,205
I know you don't want
your parents to suffer.

121
00:22:08,414 --> 00:22:11,625
Your hard work will pay off.

122
00:22:23,095 --> 00:22:27,516
I know it's because your father
and I don't have the skills

123
00:22:28,225 --> 00:22:31,979
that we have to exploit you.

124
00:22:33,105 --> 00:22:36,984
If we had a choice,
how could we do this to you?

125
00:22:38,569 --> 00:22:43,324
You know your father
isn't educated. He can't read.

126
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:49,121
Whatever clothing you need

127
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,707
buy a little bit.

128
00:22:51,957 --> 00:22:57,087
The rest of the money
send back to your parents.

129
00:22:57,087 --> 00:22:58,923
We'll put it aside.

130
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:08,682
In your daily life, eat well.
Don't save money on that, okay?

131
00:23:08,807 --> 00:23:12,478
When you spend money on food,
don't worry about us too much.

132
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,007
I'm going to give you
an English name.

133
00:26:28,174 --> 00:26:29,967
We'll call you Cindy.

134
00:26:37,349 --> 00:26:39,268
- What's your name?
- Chen Bo Yu.

135
00:26:39,351 --> 00:26:41,145
- What's you English name?
- Jerry.

136
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,731
He's Jerry. Cindy.

137
00:26:44,899 --> 00:26:47,109
This is our operations manager,
Michael.

138
00:26:49,737 --> 00:26:55,034
You have two long-sleeves,
two trousers and two t-shirts.

139
00:26:56,952 --> 00:26:59,079
Here are two long trousers.

140
00:26:59,205 --> 00:27:02,416
Here is a tie and apron,
one for each.

141
00:27:02,958 --> 00:27:04,585
Here is a tie clip.

142
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,877
How do you like it?

143
00:27:52,424 --> 00:27:55,135
Eyes front!

144
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:57,638
Stand to the right!

145
00:28:02,268 --> 00:28:03,978
Who's still moving?

146
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,190
You can't hold still
for a short time?

147
00:28:09,775 --> 00:28:12,361
Quality service.
Do we have the confidence?

148
00:28:12,361 --> 00:28:13,863
Yes.

149
00:28:14,154 --> 00:28:15,823
I can't hear the confidence
in your voice.

150
00:28:15,906 --> 00:28:17,658
- Do you have it or not?
- Yes!

151
00:28:17,992 --> 00:28:18,951
That's better.

152
00:28:20,286 --> 00:28:23,664
Let's talk about
studying English.

153
00:28:23,873 --> 00:28:25,666
Twenty years ago,

154
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:29,670
when I first brought
foreign tourists,

155
00:28:29,795 --> 00:28:32,173
people in Hong Kong
would call them

156
00:28:32,214 --> 00:28:33,465
"foreign devils".

157
00:29:12,546 --> 00:29:16,509
So now, let's invite Cindy.

158
00:29:54,421 --> 00:29:57,299
You can try speaking slower.

159
00:30:05,558 --> 00:30:09,103
My "University of Life"
has just begun.

160
00:31:53,499 --> 00:31:57,086
You should greet guests
wherever you meet them,

161
00:31:57,211 --> 00:31:59,046
even by the staircase.

162
00:32:00,172 --> 00:32:01,924
No! Don't say, "Hello"!

163
00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:03,092
Normally you say:

164
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:08,097
That's the proper way.

165
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:31,120
Most of the tourists are French
this time.

166
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,713
At lunch you let out the water.

167
00:32:40,838 --> 00:32:44,175
When you come back at dinnertime
you add water.

168
00:32:44,925 --> 00:32:48,262
You have to
keep plates and bowls seperate.

169
00:32:48,345 --> 00:32:50,264
Otherwise, you damage them.

170
00:32:50,556 --> 00:32:53,434
Here's the daily cleaning fluid.

171
00:32:54,894 --> 00:32:57,146
Press that to wash.

172
00:33:01,984 --> 00:33:04,445
If you don't do this properly,
the water leaks out.

173
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:06,864
It'll be messy.

174
00:33:06,947 --> 00:33:09,241
Have a look.
This is the sink.

175
00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:17,875
Here's the electricity switch

176
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:20,920
The first thing you do
every morning is switch it on.

177
00:33:21,045 --> 00:33:22,963
The whole place will light up.

178
00:33:23,088 --> 00:33:27,343
Plates with a blue circle
belong to the kitchen.

179
00:33:29,803 --> 00:33:30,804
When the time comes,

180
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:32,973
I will set you up
with more complex work.

181
00:33:33,015 --> 00:33:34,391
Okay.

182
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,814
So tired!

183
00:35:19,538 --> 00:35:23,417
Pay attention
when talking to Americans

184
00:35:23,501 --> 00:35:26,295
to not be overly modest
or polite.

185
00:35:27,379 --> 00:35:31,884
Too modest
or a even little bit humble,

186
00:35:31,926 --> 00:35:36,096
they might think
you're a bit fake.

187
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:40,643
Don't compare Canada to
the United States.

188
00:35:42,436 --> 00:35:47,316
Don't talk about
Quebec independence.

189
00:35:47,399 --> 00:35:51,904
Avoid the issue
of Northern Ireland.

190
00:35:52,112 --> 00:35:53,364
Don't talk about this issue.

191
00:35:58,202 --> 00:36:03,958
Don't talk about monarchies,
royalty or royal families,

192
00:36:04,041 --> 00:36:08,295
or any relevant serious
political issues.

193
00:36:09,797 --> 00:36:16,178
Don't call anybody
old, pale or fat!

194
00:36:17,179 --> 00:36:20,808
In English you will say "plump".

195
00:36:43,998 --> 00:36:46,417
Drain the water
after you take out the garbage.

196
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,002
Make sure everything is clean.

197
00:36:48,085 --> 00:36:49,378
That's it.

198
00:36:54,383 --> 00:36:56,594
You shouldn't say
that is good enough.

199
00:36:56,677 --> 00:36:58,095
You need to finish it.

200
00:36:58,179 --> 00:37:02,975
Make sure you clean the mess
thoroughly and properly.

201
00:37:03,017 --> 00:37:05,477
You can't leave things
half-done.

202
00:37:06,145 --> 00:37:11,525
If you have to clean this place,
then make it clean.

203
00:37:28,751 --> 00:37:31,545
Don't cry.
Just do it slowly, okay?

204
00:37:31,921 --> 00:37:34,465
You will learn more
by toughening up.

205
00:37:38,802 --> 00:37:41,597
Don't be upset.
This is not difficult.

206
00:37:41,722 --> 00:37:43,724
All you need to do
is to clean this up.

207
00:37:43,849 --> 00:37:45,768
That's our duty.

208
00:37:45,893 --> 00:37:48,896
It's not any easier
to serve in the dining hall.

209
00:37:48,979 --> 00:37:50,773
You still need to work hard.

210
00:37:50,898 --> 00:37:52,608
And this is straightforward work

211
00:37:53,067 --> 00:37:54,818
and easy to do.

212
00:38:07,289 --> 00:38:10,543
You always have to remind her
at work.

213
00:38:10,668 --> 00:38:13,546
Yes, always have to remind her.

214
00:38:14,338 --> 00:38:16,340
She doesn't know enough,

215
00:38:16,799 --> 00:38:19,260
especially when
it comes to hygiene.

216
00:38:19,593 --> 00:38:22,721
And communicating with people.

217
00:38:22,763 --> 00:38:26,725
I got blisters on my hands
when I first came on the boat.

218
00:38:26,851 --> 00:38:27,893
Nobody can help you.

219
00:38:28,018 --> 00:38:30,312
If you're doing guest rooms,

220
00:38:30,396 --> 00:38:32,106
you have to do
your own work.

221
00:38:32,189 --> 00:38:34,483
Everybody has
their own duties to cover.

222
00:38:34,608 --> 00:38:36,777
She really has to change a lot.

223
00:38:38,362 --> 00:38:39,947
Is she afraid of asking?

224
00:38:40,281 --> 00:38:42,992
No, I don't think she realizes
that she needs to ask.

225
00:38:43,117 --> 00:38:44,118
She should be more hunble

226
00:38:44,243 --> 00:38:46,161
when she's working
in the kitchen.

227
00:38:46,245 --> 00:38:49,248
I think she's a bit shy, though.

228
00:38:49,373 --> 00:38:54,378
She lives by the river
and her family is really poor.

229
00:38:55,921 --> 00:38:58,966
If her family is poor then
she should work even harder.

230
00:41:26,071 --> 00:41:29,909
Oh, this one!
I was wondering what it was.

231
00:41:31,827 --> 00:41:34,121
Yu Shui, what are you doing?

232
00:41:34,663 --> 00:41:36,332
I'm writing some stuff.

233
00:41:36,999 --> 00:41:38,501
Writing your diary?

234
00:41:38,542 --> 00:41:40,753
Yeah, sort of .. diary.

235
00:41:45,466 --> 00:41:48,511
I'm worried
if the river rises back home

236
00:41:48,636 --> 00:41:52,306
and floods our land and house.

237
00:41:53,224 --> 00:41:56,602
I'm worried that my father
can't find a place to move to

238
00:41:56,685 --> 00:41:58,521
and what will he do afterwards?

239
00:42:01,023 --> 00:42:03,067
I'm just worried about them.

240
00:42:03,859 --> 00:42:05,569
I miss them every day.

241
00:42:50,531 --> 00:42:54,535
We'll eat as soon as your mother
cooks the winter-melon.

242
00:42:55,327 --> 00:42:56,704
It's still early.

243
00:42:56,829 --> 00:42:59,248
It's not even
6:00 in the morning yet.

244
00:43:58,557 --> 00:44:00,809
- What dynasty is it?
- Ming dynasty!

245
00:44:00,851 --> 00:44:03,145
- Ming dynasty?
- Yes, Ming era!

246
00:44:04,355 --> 00:44:07,942
How much for that one?
Sell it if you like my offer.

247
00:44:08,442 --> 00:44:10,986
Don't be so difficult!

248
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:14,156
We're moving. The prices
are already the lowest!

249
00:44:15,658 --> 00:44:18,786
There will always be people
who need to make sacrifices.

250
00:44:19,411 --> 00:44:21,413
It's impossible to stop

251
00:44:21,497 --> 00:44:23,958
the building of
the Three Gorges Dam

252
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:25,543
because of my own needs.

253
00:44:26,627 --> 00:44:29,880
Sacrificing the little family
for the big family.

254
00:44:31,173 --> 00:44:35,302
If you house will be flooded,
then don't stay here!

255
00:44:39,181 --> 00:44:43,310
I will report to
a higher-level government.

256
00:44:44,645 --> 00:44:47,189
Look, they're fighting
about resettlement again.

257
00:44:47,273 --> 00:44:48,691
You just can't help it.

258
00:44:50,693 --> 00:44:51,944
Go take a look!

259
00:44:52,111 --> 00:44:55,155
We did all the calculations,
signed all the papers,

260
00:44:55,239 --> 00:44:57,032
and had the house demolished.

261
00:44:57,491 --> 00:44:58,617
After all these months,

262
00:44:58,701 --> 00:45:00,995
we still didn't get
the promised compensation.

263
00:45:01,078 --> 00:45:02,788
The Zhan village got 300 yuan,

264
00:45:02,872 --> 00:45:05,541
while we only got
200 yuan compensation.

265
00:45:06,375 --> 00:45:08,544
They had people
come and beat us!

266
00:45:08,961 --> 00:45:11,213
What can you say about us
getting beaten up?

267
00:45:11,297 --> 00:45:14,175
They tore down our machines
and threw them on the ground.

268
00:45:17,887 --> 00:45:20,014
It's hard being a human

269
00:45:20,055 --> 00:45:23,058
but being a common person
in China is even more difficult.

270
00:45:28,856 --> 00:45:31,317
China is too hard
for common people.

271
00:45:33,402 --> 00:45:35,529
Some officials are like bandits:

272
00:45:35,946 --> 00:45:37,781
Beating, smashing, robbing...

273
00:45:40,993 --> 00:45:44,872
Even wanting a roof
over our heads is difficult.

274
00:45:48,667 --> 00:45:55,591
When we had to move,
we were dragged and beaten.

275
00:45:57,134 --> 00:46:01,222
No money to bribe the officials,
so they gave us a hard time.

276
00:46:05,226 --> 00:46:07,937
For common people
living day-by-day...

277
00:46:08,562 --> 00:46:10,523
...it's really not easy.

278
00:46:47,309 --> 00:46:50,771
Ladies and gentlemen, you know,
after this dam is finished

279
00:46:50,813 --> 00:46:55,234
the most important thing
is the relocatee.

280
00:46:55,609 --> 00:46:58,445
How about the relocatee?
Would you like to have a look?

281
00:46:58,487 --> 00:47:03,033
This is the new apartment
of the relocatees.

282
00:47:03,117 --> 00:47:04,535
Where is the old house?

283
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:08,414
The old house
is already underwater.

284
00:47:09,665 --> 00:47:12,960
Ladies and gentlemen,
shall we get off the coach?

285
00:47:13,669 --> 00:47:16,046
If you have
any questions or issues,

286
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:18,090
you can ask the farmer directly.

287
00:47:18,174 --> 00:47:21,719
I will just do
the job of the interpreter.

288
00:47:23,012 --> 00:47:28,184
In the farmer's house, they have
the refrigerator, colour TV,

289
00:47:29,018 --> 00:47:30,394
air conditioning.

290
00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:33,731
I think the house is okay.

291
00:47:34,148 --> 00:47:36,567
Seeing is believing.

292
00:47:36,734 --> 00:47:39,820
Would you like to have a look
with your own eyes?

293
00:49:36,312 --> 00:49:40,024
I have been doing this
for almost half-a-month now.

294
00:49:40,149 --> 00:49:44,028
The weather has been dry.

295
00:49:44,361 --> 00:49:49,200
You can't get any income
from farming.

296
00:49:49,325 --> 00:49:55,331
You can't grow anything
in the land.

297
00:49:55,497 --> 00:49:57,499
When the Three Gorges gate
closes,

298
00:49:57,583 --> 00:49:59,543
the water level will soon rise

299
00:49:59,668 --> 00:50:02,046
and the farmland
will be flooded.

300
00:50:02,505 --> 00:50:05,466
I'll have to earn
some extra cash

301
00:50:05,758 --> 00:50:10,429
to pay for my kids' studies
and to live.

302
00:50:10,888 --> 00:50:13,641
No money if I stay home.

303
00:50:14,808 --> 00:50:17,561
It's coming, coming, coming.

304
00:50:19,188 --> 00:50:20,648
Watch out!

305
00:50:23,067 --> 00:50:25,194
Watch out, watch out!

306
00:51:52,448 --> 00:51:54,283
I don't like these
with the hood.

307
00:51:54,366 --> 00:51:57,328
Let me find you a larger one.
That's kind of small.

308
00:51:57,411 --> 00:52:01,290
How about you just try it on?
Just put it on, okay?

309
00:52:01,332 --> 00:52:02,875
Just put it on.
Can we try it?

310
00:52:03,334 --> 00:52:04,585
Here we go.

311
00:52:04,919 --> 00:52:07,129
Just hang your clothes up there.

312
00:52:12,801 --> 00:52:13,928
It's kind of tight.

313
00:52:15,137 --> 00:52:16,639
It's not revealing!

314
00:52:16,805 --> 00:52:17,765
That's not revealing.

315
00:52:17,848 --> 00:52:19,642
She didn't
clip the button properly.

316
00:52:19,725 --> 00:52:21,644
Don't slouch.

317
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:26,148
You have to put the sleeves
like this. To this side.

318
00:52:26,815 --> 00:52:27,775
That's nice.

319
00:52:27,858 --> 00:52:31,028
Yes, it's better
than the other one.

320
00:52:33,113 --> 00:52:34,073
Like that!

321
00:52:34,156 --> 00:52:36,492
She should straighten
her shoulders!

322
00:52:36,575 --> 00:52:38,202
That will look much better.

323
00:52:38,285 --> 00:52:39,703
Yeah, that's better.

324
00:52:40,704 --> 00:52:43,165
It's nice. How much is it?

325
00:52:44,708 --> 00:52:47,628
It's 148 yuan
with a 20 percent discount.

326
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:49,088
20 percent discount?

327
00:52:49,171 --> 00:52:51,715
Help me calculate.
How about a little cheaper?

328
00:52:51,799 --> 00:52:53,676
How about 100 yuan?

329
00:52:55,719 --> 00:52:56,637
Okay.

330
00:53:33,632 --> 00:53:34,675
Mom!

331
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,887
You're early.
When did you come?

332
00:53:38,846 --> 00:53:41,432
- I've just come down.
- Just come down.

333
00:53:45,394 --> 00:53:46,645
This must be your father!

334
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:48,731
Your parents, right?
Nice to meet you.

335
00:53:48,772 --> 00:53:50,524
My name is Zheng.

336
00:53:51,734 --> 00:53:56,071
How about we go on the boat
for a little sit-down?

337
00:53:56,864 --> 00:54:00,576
- That's not necessary.
- It's nothing. Let's go.

338
00:54:00,701 --> 00:54:02,661
Let's go have
a look around, okay?

339
00:54:02,745 --> 00:54:05,414
- Okay.
- Yes, come. Come.

340
00:54:05,915 --> 00:54:09,710
I'm sorry if my daughter
is too young and disobedient...

341
00:54:10,711 --> 00:54:13,547
Hopefully you can tolerate her.

342
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:52,545
You have a nice view
from the bar.

343
00:55:13,023 --> 00:55:15,150
Employees need to speak English.

344
00:55:15,192 --> 00:55:19,321
Little Yu
is working hard to learn.

345
00:55:19,822 --> 00:55:22,908
Yes, that's for sure.

346
00:55:23,158 --> 00:55:25,911
The kind of thing
she always wants to learn.

347
00:55:25,995 --> 00:55:27,913
The situation is impossible

348
00:55:27,997 --> 00:55:30,541
because of
our family's condition.

349
00:55:30,666 --> 00:55:32,960
Now that she's on the boat

350
00:55:33,252 --> 00:55:36,255
she might need
a lot of help from you.

351
00:55:36,338 --> 00:55:39,633
As for herself, unlike others,

352
00:55:40,176 --> 00:55:45,181
she doesn't mess around
that much.

353
00:55:45,181 --> 00:55:48,017
She's never had
a chance to go out

354
00:55:48,058 --> 00:55:50,186
and see the world before.

355
00:55:50,269 --> 00:55:52,021
This is her first time.

356
00:55:52,396 --> 00:55:55,232
It's a big step forward.

357
00:55:55,316 --> 00:55:59,695
To deal with Western customers,
from developed countries,

358
00:55:59,695 --> 00:56:02,698
that's a big change.

359
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:10,956
You should have confidence
in yourself and your daughter.

360
00:56:12,124 --> 00:56:17,046
Confidence to believe
that things are changing.

361
00:56:17,922 --> 00:56:20,716
The dreams you cannot fulfill

362
00:56:20,758 --> 00:56:24,887
can be fulfilled
through you daughter,

363
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:30,684
through her hard work,
and the progress of society.

364
00:56:31,727 --> 00:56:33,395
Don't worry!

365
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:40,444
- Say goodbye to your parents.
- Goodbye.

366
00:56:42,947 --> 00:56:44,990
- Be good!
- Okay.

367
00:56:45,407 --> 00:56:48,202
Listen to your manager.
Work hard.

368
00:56:49,537 --> 00:56:52,122
Let's go.
I'll see you later.

369
00:57:57,855 --> 00:58:00,232
I pray to the Holy Father

370
00:58:00,357 --> 00:58:05,154
It's a blessing
to believe in God

371
00:58:05,696 --> 00:58:12,328
I pray everyday
that God comes to help me

372
00:58:13,412 --> 00:58:17,166
I pray for the youth

373
00:58:18,167 --> 00:58:20,920
The youth should also
come to God

374
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:25,341
To learn how to be
and how to tolerate

375
00:58:25,466 --> 00:58:29,637
Don't quarrel
Praise God

376
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:32,973
God, I beg for your blessing.

377
00:58:33,098 --> 00:58:35,935
Your humble daughter
with many troubles.

378
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:40,105
Tears in my eyes,
thoughts stuck in my mind,

379
00:58:40,231 --> 00:58:43,943
as if someone is clawing
at my heart.

380
00:58:44,109 --> 00:58:47,947
I'm God's child. I depend on you
to eat, drink and live.

381
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:52,868
Wherever you go I will
follow forever. Praise God.

382
01:00:42,394 --> 01:00:45,189
If you are satisfied
with our service,

383
01:00:45,272 --> 01:00:47,024
we feel very cheerful.

384
01:00:58,369 --> 01:01:00,663
Welcome to our boat again.

385
01:01:37,324 --> 01:01:41,829
Whoa. Thirty. Thirty!

386
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,505
I'm so happy.
Fuck, 30 US dollars!

387
01:01:52,256 --> 01:01:53,424
I can't believe it.

388
01:01:53,549 --> 01:01:56,051
You did nothing
and she gave you 30 dollars!

389
01:01:56,093 --> 01:01:57,803
They're out of their minds!

390
01:02:08,147 --> 01:02:11,775
Now, since
I'm earning my own tips,

391
01:02:12,193 --> 01:02:19,074
I've learned
how to handle rich people.

392
01:02:19,158 --> 01:02:24,330
You have to know
how to use your eyes, right?

393
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:25,039
Normally I don't help
the elderly.

394
01:02:25,122 --> 01:02:28,209
Even if they ask I won't go.

395
01:02:28,292 --> 01:02:29,543
I would ask someone else

396
01:02:29,668 --> 01:02:32,254
because I know that they're
the fucking poorest.

397
01:02:32,379 --> 01:02:35,674
They are the stingiest.
They only give two yuan tips.

398
01:02:35,758 --> 01:02:38,344
What the fuck do I do
with two yuan?

399
01:02:38,469 --> 01:02:41,347
If they're too young or too old,
they won't give tips.

400
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:46,101
The best are the middle-aged men
or women.

401
01:02:46,644 --> 01:02:48,229
I earn the most.

402
01:02:48,521 --> 01:02:49,605
Fuck, think about it.

403
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:52,149
My mom only earns
1000 yuan a month.

404
01:02:52,233 --> 01:02:55,486
My father makes about 2000 yuan.
Actually less than that.

405
01:03:24,431 --> 01:03:27,101
How's life on the boat?

406
01:03:27,810 --> 01:03:29,520
Life is pretty good.

407
01:03:31,355 --> 01:03:33,899
Do you eat meat everyday?

408
01:03:36,443 --> 01:03:38,320
Everyday we always have

409
01:03:40,823 --> 01:03:42,950
meat and vegetables.

410
01:03:45,369 --> 01:03:46,537
Do they have television?

411
01:03:46,662 --> 01:03:49,164
Yeah, there's television,
fans...

412
01:03:49,248 --> 01:03:52,168
The tour guides' cabins
are even air conditioned.

413
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:56,547
Did you meet any friends
on the boat?

414
01:03:57,381 --> 01:03:58,924
I've gotten to know
quite a few.

415
01:04:00,426 --> 01:04:04,388
One of them is called Xie Juan.

416
01:04:05,014 --> 01:04:08,058
Her English name is Yo Yo.

417
01:04:10,019 --> 01:04:13,731
She actually treats me
pretty well.

418
01:04:14,231 --> 01:04:16,400
We're always joking around
and laughing together.

419
01:04:16,525 --> 01:04:18,068
She gives me nicknames.

420
01:04:18,194 --> 01:04:19,737
Because I have darker skin,

421
01:04:19,862 --> 01:04:22,364
she calls me
a little grey rabbit!

422
01:04:23,365 --> 01:04:29,538
I don't know
whether to laugh or cry.

423
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:39,131
Do you feel homesick?

424
01:04:40,341 --> 01:04:42,301
Yeah, I do. Everyday.

425
01:04:43,052 --> 01:04:45,262
You still want to come back
and see us, right?

426
01:04:45,346 --> 01:04:46,889
Yeah.

427
01:05:34,562 --> 01:05:37,439
Girls should know
how to pamper themselves.

428
01:05:39,024 --> 01:05:41,193
Will you blame me
if I hurt you with this?

429
01:05:41,318 --> 01:05:42,570
What do you think?

430
01:05:42,695 --> 01:05:43,946
You need to dress-up

431
01:05:44,113 --> 01:05:46,740
so you're more pleasant
to the eye.

432
01:05:46,824 --> 01:05:50,160
It's easier to be with them.
Is that right?

433
01:05:50,661 --> 01:05:51,912
That's right.

434
01:05:57,209 --> 01:05:59,587
I'm drawing you
to look like a panda.

435
01:06:02,047 --> 01:06:04,175
You're laughing all the time.

436
01:06:09,138 --> 01:06:12,600
Got to put on lipstick
to bring out the shape.

437
01:06:13,976 --> 01:06:15,936
Now you look so womanly!

438
01:06:20,316 --> 01:06:22,318
It'd be better
if you hair was longer.

439
01:06:22,401 --> 01:06:24,028
You'd look like a doll!

440
01:06:24,653 --> 01:06:27,406
Now smile.
Isn't that cute?

441
01:06:38,584 --> 01:06:41,212
Please welcome Chen Bo Yu.

442
01:06:46,050 --> 01:06:48,010
I dedicate this song to you.

443
01:06:48,052 --> 01:06:50,387
Enjoy your vacation.
Thank you.

444
01:06:55,976 --> 01:07:00,564
When the earth rotates,
it's a day

445
01:07:02,608 --> 01:07:08,697
That means I'm missing you
for another extra day

446
01:07:10,407 --> 01:07:13,744
Forever the same horizon

447
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:17,623
My heart

448
01:07:18,082 --> 01:07:21,418
will never change

449
01:07:23,254 --> 01:07:27,675
Love you for then thousand years

450
01:07:30,261 --> 01:07:35,766
That love can overcome
all obstacles

451
01:07:36,934 --> 01:07:42,106
Surpass the limitations of time

452
01:07:42,648 --> 01:07:47,778
Bring closer
another part of the world

453
01:07:47,903 --> 01:07:51,949
Stay with eacht other,
close together forever

454
01:08:04,753 --> 01:08:11,218
I told Chen Bo Yu that if he
wants to learn I can teach him.

455
01:08:11,343 --> 01:08:14,763
But he doesn't respect me.
I hate these types of people.

456
01:08:15,139 --> 01:08:17,141
He's so arrogant.

457
01:08:18,267 --> 01:08:21,812
He's like an actor.

458
01:08:21,896 --> 01:08:23,981
Not someone who goes to work.

459
01:08:24,148 --> 01:08:26,775
So we've never taken him
as one of us.

460
01:08:27,443 --> 01:08:29,570
He's a superstar.

461
01:08:31,822 --> 01:08:34,742
- Look at him.
- Just eat your food.

462
01:08:36,118 --> 01:08:38,370
Don't make me choke.

463
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,336
Chen Bo Yu,
what are you thinking?

464
01:08:46,712 --> 01:08:50,508
I'm asking,
what are you thinking?

465
01:08:52,468 --> 01:08:54,303
I'm going to cry.

466
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:14,823
Self-criticism. Heping and I carried suitcases to room 332.

467
01:09:15,658 --> 01:09:17,952
As usual we went in,

468
01:09:18,077 --> 01:09:23,165
put down the luggage
and said hello to the guests.

469
01:09:23,874 --> 01:09:26,168
We stayed for several minutes

470
01:09:26,293 --> 01:09:29,171
and the customer gave us
20 US Dollars for tips.

471
01:09:29,630 --> 01:09:35,010
Then we left
and closed the door.

472
01:09:42,351 --> 01:09:45,563
I didn't ask her for it.

473
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:49,692
I never said: "You need
to give me some personal tips".

474
01:09:49,817 --> 01:09:51,986
I never said this at all.

475
01:09:53,362 --> 01:09:55,823
We closed the door and left.
She complained.

476
01:09:55,906 --> 01:10:01,161
She complained and said
we asked her for tips.

477
01:10:05,791 --> 01:10:08,711
I don't think
I'm suitable for this job.

478
01:10:09,086 --> 01:10:12,548
I'm too arrogant.
I look down on everything.

479
01:10:16,510 --> 01:10:20,639
I think I was born
with a silver spoon.

480
01:10:25,936 --> 01:10:28,939
My parents
keep me in the future.

481
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:31,817
I'm very young.
I'm 19 years old.

482
01:10:32,484 --> 01:10:36,780
This is their responsibility.

483
01:10:38,115 --> 01:10:40,492
But Yu Shui is only sixteen.

484
01:10:40,618 --> 01:10:44,288
We're different.
I come from a richer family.

485
01:10:45,581 --> 01:10:47,917
I can continue my studies but
does she have the opportunity?

486
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,127
Can her family support her
to go to school?

487
01:10:50,211 --> 01:10:52,963
Well, my family can.

488
01:11:00,971 --> 01:11:05,059
First, when
the customer come in

489
01:11:05,184 --> 01:11:08,437
you need to smile, got it?

490
01:11:09,271 --> 01:11:12,024
Do you know how to smile?
A gentle smile?

491
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:15,444
You can't smile like that!
You have to be natural.

492
01:11:15,528 --> 01:11:17,821
Not a silly smile.

493
01:11:17,905 --> 01:11:20,616
Then let the guests
remember your name.

494
01:11:21,951 --> 01:11:24,745
Your English name.
Introduce yourself to them.

495
01:11:25,829 --> 01:11:27,915
My name is Cindy.

496
01:11:29,124 --> 01:11:32,920
Do you know any tourist spots
along the Yangtze?

497
01:11:33,963 --> 01:11:37,007
For example, do you know where
we are now?

498
01:11:39,093 --> 01:11:40,052
No, I don't know.

499
01:11:40,177 --> 01:11:43,180
From now on,
you need to know them, okay?

500
01:11:43,264 --> 01:11:47,017
You have to work harder
and maybe later on

501
01:11:47,476 --> 01:11:52,398
you'll be promoted to server
out here and earn tips.

502
01:12:06,871 --> 01:12:08,831
The situation now

503
01:12:08,956 --> 01:12:12,209
is that there's no way
I can get compensation

504
01:12:13,169 --> 01:12:18,174
In the end it feels like
the rock I carried

505
01:12:18,257 --> 01:12:20,301
has smashed my foot.

506
01:12:23,929 --> 01:12:29,143
As a peasant who doesn't read
or watch television

507
01:12:29,268 --> 01:12:33,689
I can't make any judgment on it.

508
01:12:34,523 --> 01:12:41,947
I believe this business belongs
to the upper government.

509
01:12:45,242 --> 01:12:47,411
Nobody cares about me.

510
01:12:47,494 --> 01:12:51,999
Like people say,
"I'm like an illegal citizen".

511
01:13:22,738 --> 01:13:26,367
Jerry, you've been here
for a while now, right?

512
01:13:26,450 --> 01:13:28,118
Yeah, it's been
three months already.

513
01:13:28,202 --> 01:13:30,329
The probation period.

514
01:13:30,913 --> 01:13:35,960
So for
the three months probation

515
01:13:36,669 --> 01:13:42,800
I think you've somehow
learned things and advanced.

516
01:13:43,467 --> 01:13:46,053
However, in other words...

517
01:13:53,102 --> 01:13:56,522
That means both your performance
and your capability

518
01:13:56,647 --> 01:14:00,317
are below the standards
of our ship's requirements.

519
01:14:02,027 --> 01:14:06,740
That means you will have to
leave our company

520
01:14:07,491 --> 01:14:10,870
and find another job.

521
01:14:14,164 --> 01:14:18,794
Over-confidence, self-conceit,
and self-centeredness

522
01:14:18,878 --> 01:14:23,966
for a young man,
especially for a single child,

523
01:14:24,675 --> 01:14:30,514
are the characteristics
you need to overcome.

524
01:14:30,764 --> 01:14:33,058
That's how I feel about it.

525
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:42,795
Do you think the construction
is benficial to you?

526
01:15:47,299 --> 01:15:51,345
There must be some benefits.

527
01:15:51,512 --> 01:15:56,684
It's beneficial to our country,
but for individuals,

528
01:15:56,851 --> 01:16:00,229
I don't think
it will do me any good.

529
01:16:15,369 --> 01:16:17,872
- You carry this with you?
- Yeah.

530
01:16:18,914 --> 01:16:21,041
- What's that?
- It's my clothes.

531
01:16:21,584 --> 01:16:24,670
I can tell you are from Fengdu
from this.

532
01:16:25,754 --> 01:16:28,841
I'm going to show you.
Come here.

533
01:16:33,387 --> 01:16:36,557
Have you ever seen this?
This is the dam.

534
01:16:37,057 --> 01:16:40,227
- Do you have a dam in Fengdu?
- No.

535
01:16:40,853 --> 01:16:42,438
What's this?

536
01:16:42,646 --> 01:16:45,524
This is part of
the Yangtze river

537
01:16:45,608 --> 01:16:48,194
and the dam
cuts it into two pieces

538
01:16:48,194 --> 01:16:48,319
and the dam
cuts it into two pieces.

539
01:16:48,444 --> 01:16:53,782
This is what we call damming.
We did it back in 1997 and 2003.

540
01:16:54,450 --> 01:16:56,118
Have you seen it on TV?

541
01:16:56,202 --> 01:16:59,580
Yeah, but it's better
to be here myself.

542
01:17:00,164 --> 01:17:01,916
Electricity is transmitted
through wires.

543
01:17:01,999 --> 01:17:04,126
Maybe it goes to Fengdu.

544
01:17:04,585 --> 01:17:07,922
I don't know.
I have no idea about that.

545
01:17:11,217 --> 01:17:14,887
So these are all electric?

546
01:17:15,179 --> 01:17:18,474
Yes, now it's all electrical.

547
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:15,883
Keep it low so
it's easier for me to lift it.

548
01:19:16,008 --> 01:19:18,219
Don't you get it?

549
01:19:19,553 --> 01:19:23,015
- There's a big crack here.
- Where?

550
01:19:27,853 --> 01:19:31,315
Push! Yeah, push it forward
a bit.

551
01:19:36,612 --> 01:19:40,199
- Do you want me to hold it?
- No, it's not necessary.

552
01:21:50,913 --> 01:21:53,332
Here's our new home.

553
01:21:54,583 --> 01:21:58,295
Before in the little hut,

554
01:21:58,420 --> 01:22:03,133
even though it didn't look good,

555
01:22:03,217 --> 01:22:08,806
you didn't need money
for vegetables or water.

556
01:22:09,557 --> 01:22:15,229
Up here, you have to buy them.

557
01:23:39,230 --> 01:23:40,648
Go and make your own bed.

558
01:23:40,731 --> 01:23:43,067
I'm looking for
the palm mattress.

559
01:23:49,698 --> 01:23:52,826
Stretch the corner a bit.

560
01:25:29,465 --> 01:25:34,136
Our country is really strong
and prosperous now.

561
01:25:34,929 --> 01:25:36,430
So strong and prosperous

562
01:25:36,555 --> 01:25:39,642
that it can actually stop
the gigantic river.
