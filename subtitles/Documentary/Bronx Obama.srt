1
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:23,305
- You got the note?
- Yeah, right.

2
00:00:23,373 --> 00:00:27,002
Nice and tight.
Two, three, four.

3
00:00:58,274 --> 00:01:02,005
This is the Fordham section
of The Bronx: my home.

4
00:01:02,078 --> 00:01:03,943
A world unto itself.

5
00:01:04,013 --> 00:01:06,277
Any borough
is only 15 minutes away...

6
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:08,874
but they seem 3,000 miles away.

7
00:01:11,287 --> 00:01:13,084
That's Mount Carmel Church.

8
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:16,057
The sound of the bells
filled the neighborhood.

9
00:01:26,302 --> 00:01:30,136
It was 1960, and doo-wop
was the sound on the streets.

10
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:37,145
I felt like there was a doo-wop
group on every corner back then.

11
00:01:39,949 --> 00:01:41,883
What a time it was.

12
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,046
The Yankees were playing the
Pirates in the World Series...

13
00:01:47,123 --> 00:01:49,785
and Mickey Mantle
was like a god to me.

14
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:53,795
My dad and I would go to Yankee
Stadium and see the Yankees win.

15
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:59,757
That's the Chez Bippy,
where all the guys hung out.

16
00:01:59,836 --> 00:02:02,270
I'll tell you about them later.

17
00:02:05,741 --> 00:02:08,835
That's my building.
I live on the third floor.

18
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:11,709
667 East 187th Street.

19
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,883
There's my stoop.

20
00:02:18,754 --> 00:02:21,746
On warm summer nights
all through the neighborhood...

21
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:24,884
you would hear young Italian men
romancing their women.

22
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:27,020
Hey, Marie!

23
00:02:27,096 --> 00:02:30,065
- Get in the fucking car!
- No!

24
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:32,658
- Get in the car!
- Leave me alone.

25
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:35,203
- You know I love you.
- Yeah, bullshit.

26
00:02:35,271 --> 00:02:37,296
Get in the fucking car!

27
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,644
And right there,
under that lamppost there...

28
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,656
stood the number-one man
in the neighborhood, Sonny.

29
00:02:55,725 --> 00:02:58,660
Everybody loved Sonny
and treated him like a god.

30
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:02,596
And in my neighborhood,
he was a god.

31
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:07,226
I would sit on my stoop and
watch him, all day and night.

32
00:03:08,137 --> 00:03:10,435
But he would never even
look at me.

33
00:03:10,506 --> 00:03:13,373
Never, until one day.

34
00:03:21,751 --> 00:03:24,879
- What do you want?
- You got room there for us?

35
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,478
You wish.

36
00:05:19,568 --> 00:05:21,433
- Oh, shit!
- Let's go!

37
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:52,461
That's my dad, Lorenzo Anello.

38
00:05:53,502 --> 00:05:57,871
His bus route was 187th Street.
I used to love riding with him.

39
00:05:58,607 --> 00:06:01,337
That's me, Calogero,
at nine years old.

40
00:06:21,697 --> 00:06:24,131
See you later, Pop.

41
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,464
Go right upstairs, son.

42
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:38,446
That's my mom, Rosina.
She met my dad at a dance.

43
00:06:38,514 --> 00:06:41,176
They fell in love
and been together since.

44
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,694
You're always listening.
Take care of this fucking...

45
00:08:23,052 --> 00:08:25,282
Come on. Knock him out!

46
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:36,664
The Chez Bippy.
This is where all the guys hung out.

47
00:08:36,732 --> 00:08:39,758
Get the fuck out of here!
Take a walk!

48
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:43,638
Tony Toupee was owner of the bar
in name only.

49
00:08:43,706 --> 00:08:45,640
It was really Sonny's place.

50
00:08:48,978 --> 00:08:51,606
Tony was a frustrated singer.
Everybody hated his voice.

51
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,740
So just for spite, he would
never utter a spoken word.

52
00:08:54,817 --> 00:08:56,307
He would only sing it.

53
00:08:56,385 --> 00:08:59,183
He was Tony Toupee
because of his lousy hairpiece.

54
00:09:04,026 --> 00:09:06,119
Eddie Mush
was a degenerate gambler.

55
00:09:06,195 --> 00:09:08,390
He was the world's
biggest loser.

56
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:11,365
He was "Mush" because everything
he touched turned to mush.

57
00:09:11,433 --> 00:09:13,799
Never mind.
I need a winner.

58
00:09:13,869 --> 00:09:17,498
At the track, the teller would
give him his tickets ripped up.

59
00:09:17,573 --> 00:09:19,598
I had the Yankees. They lost.

60
00:09:19,675 --> 00:09:23,111
If it wasn't for bad luck,
I wouldn't have no luck at all.

61
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:26,447
JoJo the Whale.

62
00:09:26,515 --> 00:09:29,075
You didn't walk with JoJo,
you walked among him.

63
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:32,279
If you stared long enough,
you'd see him get fatter by the hour.

64
00:09:33,255 --> 00:09:36,383
Legend has it his shadow
once killed a dog.

65
00:09:39,228 --> 00:09:40,889
They called him
Frankie Coffeecake...

66
00:09:40,963 --> 00:09:44,490
because his face looked like
a Drake's Coffeecake.

67
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:47,127
He was tough to look at.

68
00:09:59,848 --> 00:10:01,873
Hey, kid, how you doing?

69
00:10:03,619 --> 00:10:06,486
His name was Jimmy Whispers.
He was Sonny's main man.

70
00:10:07,556 --> 00:10:10,719
He was "Whispers" because
everything was a secret to him.

71
00:10:15,965 --> 00:10:17,990
Danny K.O. knocked guys out...

72
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:20,968
and Bobby Bars spent
half his life behind them.

73
00:10:21,036 --> 00:10:24,938
This was Sonny's crew, and
nobody fucked with these guys.

74
00:10:26,008 --> 00:10:30,877
What are you doing here
Didn't we tell you not to come here?

75
00:10:30,946 --> 00:10:34,575
I told you to come upstairs!
Wait till I tell your father!

76
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:38,211
- What were you doing here?
- I was looking for Daddy.

77
00:10:38,287 --> 00:10:39,720
That's very nice!

78
00:10:41,457 --> 00:10:43,550
I have to get something in the store.
Don't move!

79
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:46,322
You wait right here! You hear me?

80
00:10:48,497 --> 00:10:52,991
I always tried to imitate Sonny.
He still wouldn't look at me.

81
00:10:58,007 --> 00:11:00,271
Sonny had five fingers...

82
00:11:00,342 --> 00:11:02,401
but he only used three.

83
00:11:04,546 --> 00:11:06,980
Come on. Let's go.
Move. Upstairs.

84
00:11:14,923 --> 00:11:16,857
I'm not in the mood for steak.

85
00:11:16,925 --> 00:11:18,950
You're not?

86
00:11:19,028 --> 00:11:21,519
You know how often I have to drive
that bus back and forth...

87
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,861
so we can eat steak once a week?

88
00:11:23,932 --> 00:11:25,866
- Seven.
- Who told you that?

89
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:27,196
Nobody. I counted.

90
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,362
Your father
wants to talk to you.

91
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,771
- About what?
- You were by the bar today.

92
00:11:32,841 --> 00:11:35,401
- I wasn't.
- Tell your father the truth!

93
00:11:35,477 --> 00:11:37,775
- I was by the bar.
- Why'd you lie?

94
00:11:37,846 --> 00:11:40,178
- I took a shot.
- Wanna do something here?

95
00:11:40,249 --> 00:11:42,376
What am I gonna say?
Nice try, son.

96
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:45,113
- Thanks, Dad.
- Lorenzo, come on, please!

97
00:11:45,187 --> 00:11:47,348
How can I keep him away?
It's two doors away.

98
00:11:47,423 --> 00:11:49,687
Daddy's right.
Listen to him.

99
00:11:49,758 --> 00:11:51,521
Shut up.
Nobody's talking to you.

100
00:11:51,593 --> 00:11:53,458
Give me your plate.

101
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:56,930
I want you to listen to me.

102
00:11:56,999 --> 00:12:00,901
Do not go near the bar.
Stay on the stoop.

103
00:12:00,969 --> 00:12:03,767
- When you're older, you'll understand.
- Yes.

104
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,139
- You don't see me going there.
- Mommy won't let you go either?

105
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:11,373
- What am I going to do?
- I got him all day.

106
00:12:11,447 --> 00:12:14,007
I'm just kidding.
I'll won't go near the bar.

107
00:12:18,587 --> 00:12:22,216
Look what I got. Two tickets,
Yankee Stadium, center field.

108
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,623
- Behind the Mick?
- Right behind number seven.

109
00:12:24,693 --> 00:12:27,321
- Now eat your steak.
- Yeah!

110
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:33,558
Let's go, Alfie.

111
00:12:33,635 --> 00:12:35,728
That's Phil the Peddler.

112
00:12:35,804 --> 00:12:37,965
He would call everybody "Mary."

113
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,975
Me and my friends would
love to break his balls.

114
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:46,345
Slick and Crazy Mario
were my best friends.

115
00:12:46,415 --> 00:12:48,883
Slick got his name
because of his hair.

116
00:12:48,951 --> 00:12:51,784
Mario got his
because he was just crazy.

117
00:12:54,156 --> 00:12:57,683
I'll kick your fucking asses
for you, you bunch of Marys.

118
00:12:59,294 --> 00:13:02,559
Stay away from the fruit!
Keep your hands off the fruit!

119
00:13:02,631 --> 00:13:04,098
You fucking Marys!

120
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:07,431
I'll kick you loose, you Marys!
The three of you!

121
00:13:07,503 --> 00:13:11,234
I'll kick your fucking asses,
you fucking ball breakers!

122
00:13:11,306 --> 00:13:15,936
Stay away from the vegetables!
What do you think this is?

123
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:19,208
Wait! Go make your mother
and father feed you!

124
00:13:19,281 --> 00:13:23,115
I'll give you the heave-ho,
you fucking ball breakers!

125
00:13:24,653 --> 00:13:25,984
How many did you get?

126
00:13:26,054 --> 00:13:27,988
You don't stop
borrowing money!

127
00:13:28,056 --> 00:13:30,616
Oh, boy,
Coffeecake's in trouble again.

128
00:13:30,692 --> 00:13:32,216
What should I do?

129
00:13:32,294 --> 00:13:33,921
He's gonna get his ass kicked.

130
00:13:33,996 --> 00:13:37,193
Guys, check it out.
Mario, who's this?

131
00:13:45,374 --> 00:13:48,707
That's Jimmy Whispers.

132
00:13:48,777 --> 00:13:52,144
You'd better talk to him again.
You're responsible for him.

133
00:13:52,214 --> 00:13:54,148
Whoa! Come on, wait a minute.

134
00:13:59,254 --> 00:14:01,484
It's Sonny.

135
00:14:02,391 --> 00:14:05,792
You do somebody now,
big mouth.

136
00:14:05,861 --> 00:14:08,159
Do somebody hard,
like Coffeecake.

137
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:11,427
- I can't do Coffeecake!
- That's hard.

138
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,958
Put a screen in front of your
face while I throw shit at it.

139
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:18,272
Oh, shit.

140
00:14:19,575 --> 00:14:22,669
These niggers got some balls,
coming in our neighborhood.

141
00:14:22,744 --> 00:14:25,304
They just pass through
from school.

142
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,178
- How the fuck do you know?
- Dad told me.

143
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,185
My father told me
that's how it starts.

144
00:14:32,354 --> 00:14:36,051
Hey, get the fuck out of our
neighborhood, fucking niggers!

145
00:14:36,124 --> 00:14:38,058
Go back where you came from!

146
00:14:38,126 --> 00:14:40,754
You're lucky
you're on that bus!

147
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:43,195
Go back where you came from!

148
00:14:43,265 --> 00:14:47,361
Stay out of our neighborhood!
I'll kick your fucking ass!

149
00:14:51,306 --> 00:14:52,739
Why?

150
00:15:05,087 --> 00:15:09,148
You don't fucking stop.
Get the fuck out of here!

151
00:15:09,224 --> 00:15:11,488
Nobody's cooler than you, Sonny.

152
00:15:15,564 --> 00:15:18,124
What the fuck is wrong with you?

153
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,862
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you, you scumbag!

154
00:15:20,936 --> 00:15:24,030
You motherfucker!
I'll bust your fucking head!

155
00:15:26,141 --> 00:15:28,200
I'll bust your fucking head!

156
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,118
What's going on here?

157
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,455
Give me the gun!

158
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,514
Move the fucking car!

159
00:15:45,994 --> 00:15:47,393
Come on!

160
00:15:56,972 --> 00:16:00,032
When Sonny looked at me,
I went deaf.

161
00:16:00,108 --> 00:16:01,735
I couldn't hear.

162
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:05,246
All I could see was Sonny
with the gun in his hand.

163
00:16:30,706 --> 00:16:32,003
What happened?

164
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,871
Dad, it was just
a parking space.

165
00:16:33,942 --> 00:16:36,103
- You don't understand.
- Is he all right?

166
00:16:36,178 --> 00:16:38,305
- Baby, are you okay?
- Let's go inside.

167
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,575
- What happened?
- I'm okay, Mom.

168
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:43,948
Oh, my god, I got so scared.

169
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:52,586
You don't understand. They were
fighting over a parking space. Why?

170
00:16:52,661 --> 00:16:55,391
It wasn't over a parking space.
They just met at the wrong time.

171
00:16:55,464 --> 00:16:57,659
- What kind of answer is that?
- Leave it alone.

172
00:16:57,733 --> 00:16:59,667
He's okay.
That's the main thing.

173
00:16:59,735 --> 00:17:01,896
I can't believe somebody
would do this.

174
00:17:05,674 --> 00:17:07,073
Who is it?

175
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:09,406
Police. Is this
the Anello residence?

176
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,138
Yeah. Can I help you?

177
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,843
We'd like to ask you
some questions.

178
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:19,145
- About what?
- Just open the door!

179
00:17:24,893 --> 00:17:26,793
How you doing? Good.

180
00:17:26,862 --> 00:17:29,422
I'm Detective Belsik.
This is Detective Vella.

181
00:17:29,498 --> 00:17:31,261
Hello, son. How you doing, ma'am?

182
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:34,067
We'd like to ask your son
a few questions.

183
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,832
- About what?
- There was a shooting outside.

184
00:17:36,905 --> 00:17:40,705
- We believe your son was there.
- Really? He knows nothing about that.

185
00:17:40,776 --> 00:17:42,676
There were people who saw him.

186
00:17:42,744 --> 00:17:44,678
They're wrong.
He don't know nothing.

187
00:17:44,746 --> 00:17:48,648
We can do things
the nice way or the hard way.

188
00:17:48,717 --> 00:17:50,947
I don't care.
He don't know nothing.

189
00:17:51,019 --> 00:17:53,214
Daddy, I know everything.

190
00:17:56,425 --> 00:17:58,950
Kids. Sometimes they
make believe they see things.

191
00:17:59,027 --> 00:18:03,123
We didn't pick your name out of a hat.
We know he was there. So let's go.

192
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:08,398
Son, here's what
I'd like you to do for us.

193
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:12,065
Take a walk downstairs with us and
your father. We have people down there.

194
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,440
I want you to pick out
the person you saw with the gun.

195
00:18:16,511 --> 00:18:19,742
That's it. You think
you could do that for us?

196
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,192
Good. Come on.
Let's take a walk.

197
00:18:34,262 --> 00:18:36,890
Mr. Anello,
take a walk downstairs.

198
00:18:38,066 --> 00:18:40,557
- We won't be long.
- Will he be okay?

199
00:18:40,635 --> 00:18:43,536
Everything's fine.
They'll be back in two minutes.

200
00:19:06,294 --> 00:19:07,761
There's Lorenzo.

201
00:19:40,162 --> 00:19:41,754
Fellas, turn around.

202
00:19:44,699 --> 00:19:46,894
You two, take your hats off.

203
00:19:48,203 --> 00:19:51,661
Put your head up.
Straight ahead. Look this way.

204
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,106
- Is that him?
- No.

205
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:03,779
How about this guy?
Straight ahead, fella.

206
00:20:03,852 --> 00:20:05,080
How about him?

207
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:11,024
Straight ahead, you.
How about this guy?

208
00:20:13,428 --> 00:20:15,794
Give me an answer.
How about him?

209
00:20:20,936 --> 00:20:23,427
How about him?
Is it this guy?

210
00:20:25,941 --> 00:20:27,738
Give me an answer.

211
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,414
Hey! Put your eyes up!

212
00:20:35,884 --> 00:20:37,613
How about this guy?

213
00:20:43,091 --> 00:20:45,992
Let's go. Hey, look
straight ahead! Over here.

214
00:20:48,563 --> 00:20:50,394
Look at me. That's it.

215
00:20:50,465 --> 00:20:52,092
Is it this guy?

216
00:20:53,868 --> 00:20:56,166
- How about this guy?
- No.

217
00:20:59,474 --> 00:21:02,170
Look at this guy.
How about him?

218
00:21:03,712 --> 00:21:05,873
Hey! Straight ahead.

219
00:21:07,315 --> 00:21:10,478
How about this guy?
Is it him?

220
00:21:25,834 --> 00:21:27,096
Give me an answer.

221
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,332
- You satisfied, Officer?
- No.

222
00:21:33,408 --> 00:21:36,434
- He don't know.
- Yeah, yeah, he doesn't know.

223
00:21:36,511 --> 00:21:39,173
- He said he can't help you.
- Take a walk.

224
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:42,011
- Go ahead. Take a walk.
- Come on, son.

225
00:21:48,456 --> 00:21:51,948
You guys can breathe again.
Get out of my sight.

226
00:21:56,264 --> 00:21:59,165
- We really fooled them, Dad.
- Yeah.

227
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,601
I didn't rat, Dad.

228
00:22:02,671 --> 00:22:04,104
No, you didn't rat.

229
00:22:05,206 --> 00:22:07,140
I did a good thing, right?

230
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:10,439
Yeah, you did a good thing
for a bad man.

231
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:15,110
I did a good thing
for a bad man.

232
00:22:15,183 --> 00:22:17,777
I didn't understand that
at nine years old.

233
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,481
All I knew was...

234
00:22:20,555 --> 00:22:23,490
a rat was the lowest thing you
could be in my neighborhood...

235
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:24,855
and I didn't rat.

236
00:22:40,842 --> 00:22:44,073
Why did you say I did
a good thing for a bad man?

237
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:50,576
Because sometimes you have to do
things that aren't right.

238
00:22:52,253 --> 00:22:53,743
Do you understand?

239
00:22:54,923 --> 00:22:58,791
No. It's just that I thought
I did the right thing.

240
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,760
Now I'm not sure I did.

241
00:23:00,829 --> 00:23:04,196
You did do the right thing.
When you get older, you'll see.

242
00:23:04,265 --> 00:23:06,392
Your mother and I
love you very much.

243
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,007
Tomorrow you ride
on the bus with me. Okay?

244
00:23:18,713 --> 00:23:21,910
City Island was the last stop
on my father's route.

245
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:24,611
It was one of our
favorite places.

246
00:23:24,686 --> 00:23:27,177
It was like
a daylong vacation.

247
00:23:27,822 --> 00:23:31,189
My dad listened to jazz
and we talked about baseball.

248
00:23:36,231 --> 00:23:38,028
Can I have an ice cream?

249
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:41,463
We do our job first,
then ice cream.

250
00:23:41,536 --> 00:23:42,969
Okay, Pop.

251
00:23:45,807 --> 00:23:47,240
Here.

252
00:23:48,676 --> 00:23:52,043
- Let's play the game.
- Let's see how good you are.

253
00:23:52,113 --> 00:23:54,206
What player last won
the Triple Crown?

254
00:23:54,282 --> 00:23:57,683
Mickey Mantle.
Batting average,.353.

255
00:23:57,752 --> 00:24:01,848
RBIs, 130. Home runs, 52.

256
00:24:02,757 --> 00:24:05,817
- That's pretty good.
- He's the greatest player ever.

257
00:24:05,894 --> 00:24:07,828
Joe D.'s
the greatest ballplayer.

258
00:24:08,997 --> 00:24:12,990
The Yankee Clipper.
56-game hitting streak.

259
00:24:13,067 --> 00:24:15,968
- Nobody beat that. Right, Dad?
- Nobody beat that, son.

260
00:24:17,172 --> 00:24:20,300
- You know why Joe D. was great?
- Because he was Italian?

261
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:23,367
- Well, that's part of it.
- Then why?

262
00:24:23,445 --> 00:24:26,881
Because he had the most talent.
That's right.

263
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:33,119
- Do I have talent, Dad?
- Of course you do.

264
00:24:33,188 --> 00:24:34,849
Can I be a ballplayer?

265
00:24:35,657 --> 00:24:37,921
You can be anything
you want to be.

266
00:24:37,992 --> 00:24:40,859
The saddest thing in life
is wasted talent.

267
00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:45,195
If you've got talent and do the
wrong thing, nothing happens.

268
00:24:45,266 --> 00:24:48,064
But when you do right,
good things happen.

269
00:24:48,136 --> 00:24:50,798
- You hear me?
- You're right.

270
00:24:50,872 --> 00:24:53,306
- Let's get that ice cream.
- Good.

271
00:24:54,709 --> 00:24:57,644
- I'll shut the doors, right?
- Yeah.

272
00:25:01,015 --> 00:25:02,573
Ready. Watch it.

273
00:25:04,819 --> 00:25:06,980
- Got it?
- I got it.

274
00:25:08,857 --> 00:25:13,419
Wasted talent was something my
father talked about all my life.

275
00:25:14,796 --> 00:25:17,287
Let's hurry.
The game's starting.

276
00:25:17,365 --> 00:25:21,062
36,683 here to see
the final game...

277
00:25:21,135 --> 00:25:23,000
of the '60 Series.

278
00:25:23,071 --> 00:25:25,437
And what a ball game
they're looking at.

279
00:25:25,507 --> 00:25:28,908
Moose Skowron, with that
infield hit deep to third...

280
00:25:28,977 --> 00:25:32,674
has picked up his twelfth
World Series base hit in 1960.

281
00:25:37,685 --> 00:25:39,448
Time called. Blanchard back...

282
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:44,453
Come on, Sonny.

283
00:25:48,997 --> 00:25:51,989
One out, unassisted,
to Nelson, to end the sixth.

284
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,161
Southpaw hitter.
Elroy Face...

285
00:25:56,237 --> 00:25:58,432
staring down to
his battery mate Hal Smith.

286
00:25:58,506 --> 00:26:01,407
Into the stretch.
The little man sets.

287
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,239
Here's the first one
to Blanchard.

288
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:05,006
Outside and a ball.

289
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:10,778
See you later, Pop.

290
00:26:16,758 --> 00:26:19,886
Get right upstairs
and watch the rest of the game.

291
00:26:19,961 --> 00:26:21,952
No hanging out, son.

292
00:26:30,939 --> 00:26:33,066
Hey, Lorenzo, how you doing?

293
00:26:33,141 --> 00:26:35,541
Keep driving.
I want to talk to you.

294
00:26:37,412 --> 00:26:39,471
Your kid is a good kid.

295
00:26:39,547 --> 00:26:40,912
Thanks.

296
00:26:40,982 --> 00:26:43,416
Sonny appreciates
what you two did.

297
00:26:43,484 --> 00:26:46,385
That's all right. I'm just glad
everything worked out.

298
00:26:46,454 --> 00:26:47,716
He'll help you now.

299
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:51,452
You drop some numbers off for us
and make $150 a week.

300
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:55,826
- Do it right off the bus.
- Thanks, but I got a city job.

301
00:26:55,897 --> 00:26:58,058
- I could lose it.
- Think about it.

302
00:26:58,132 --> 00:27:00,157
I just can't do it.

303
00:27:00,234 --> 00:27:02,896
$150 a week. You don't
want to think about it?

304
00:27:02,971 --> 00:27:05,940
I can't do this.
It's not for me.

305
00:27:06,007 --> 00:27:09,340
Sonny will be disappointed,
but I'll give him your answer.

306
00:27:10,678 --> 00:27:13,169
Stop the bus.
I want to get off.

307
00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:34,063
- They offered me a job today.
- Doing what?

308
00:27:34,135 --> 00:27:37,866
Numbers. I just drop off
a piece of paper...

309
00:27:37,939 --> 00:27:39,873
and get 150 a week.

310
00:27:39,941 --> 00:27:42,068
What did you say?

311
00:27:42,143 --> 00:27:45,977
What do you think?
I told him it's not for me.

312
00:27:50,451 --> 00:27:51,918
What?

313
00:27:52,854 --> 00:27:56,915
I don't know. 150 dollars?
It's only numbers.

314
00:27:56,991 --> 00:28:00,256
- You think I should've took it?
- I don't know.

315
00:28:01,663 --> 00:28:05,997
But you get involved with those guys,
next thing, one, two three...

316
00:28:14,108 --> 00:28:15,769
I don't like the way you look.

317
00:28:16,644 --> 00:28:18,077
Maybe you're right.

318
00:28:19,347 --> 00:28:22,783
- I'm going to check on the baby.
- Come here.

319
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,784
- What?
- Come here.

320
00:28:26,688 --> 00:28:29,851
Are you sorry you got stuck
with a bus driver?

321
00:28:29,924 --> 00:28:33,121
I fell in love
with your uniform.

322
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:45,305
The day of the funeral,
I felt really bad.

323
00:28:45,373 --> 00:28:49,833
I realized a man died, and I
lied and committed a mortal sin.

324
00:28:49,911 --> 00:28:51,845
I wanted God's forgiveness.

325
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,917
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

326
00:29:04,992 --> 00:29:07,722
It has been one month
since my last confession...

327
00:29:07,795 --> 00:29:11,595
and these are my sins:
I missed Sunday Mass twice...

328
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,998
I lied
about witnessing a murder once.

329
00:29:14,068 --> 00:29:18,368
- I ate meat on Friday-
- Wait. Can you back up a bit?

330
00:29:19,407 --> 00:29:20,965
I ate meat on Friday once?

331
00:29:21,042 --> 00:29:23,476
Not that one.
Back up a little more.

332
00:29:23,544 --> 00:29:26,843
- About witnessing a murder?
- Yeah, that's the one.

333
00:29:26,914 --> 00:29:29,382
Do you realize what you said?

334
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:31,281
It was only once.

335
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:35,516
- Do you know what the fifth is?
- Yes, Father, I know.

336
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,922
"I refuse to answer
because I might incrimin-"

337
00:29:37,992 --> 00:29:39,584
The Fifth Commandment.

338
00:29:40,561 --> 00:29:42,051
"Thou shall not kill."

339
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:47,729
That's right. Now, I want you
to tell me what happened.

340
00:29:47,802 --> 00:29:50,396
No, Father, I'm not
telling nobody nothing.

341
00:29:50,471 --> 00:29:52,439
Don't be afraid, my son.

342
00:29:52,507 --> 00:29:56,273
- Nobody's more powerful than God.
- I don't know about that.

343
00:29:56,344 --> 00:29:58,471
Your guy's
bigger than my guy up there...

344
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:00,980
but my guy's bigger than yours
down here.

345
00:30:04,018 --> 00:30:08,148
You got a point. Five Our
Fathers and five Hail Marys.

346
00:30:08,222 --> 00:30:10,554
For a murder rap? Not bad.

347
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:13,389
- What did you say?
- Bye, Father!

348
00:30:13,461 --> 00:30:16,362
It was great to be Catholic
and go to confession.

349
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,364
You could start over
every week.

350
00:30:29,277 --> 00:30:31,006
Hey, kid!

351
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:38,643
Sonny wants to see you. Nobody's
going to grab that bike.

352
00:30:46,994 --> 00:30:49,929
They're good kids.
They just did some work for me.

353
00:30:49,997 --> 00:30:52,192
- Put them in.
- It's up to you.

354
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:57,101
Here's the kid, Sonny.
Go ahead. Don't be afraid.

355
00:31:08,115 --> 00:31:10,208
How you doing, kid?

356
00:31:11,118 --> 00:31:12,551
Good.

357
00:31:14,522 --> 00:31:16,922
We finally meet face-to-face.

358
00:31:21,028 --> 00:31:22,461
Are you afraid of me?

359
00:31:23,764 --> 00:31:25,288
- No.
- That's good.

360
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,767
What's your name?

361
00:31:28,436 --> 00:31:29,835
Calogero.

362
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:33,471
That's a big name.
You got a nickname?

363
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:39,843
- What do your friends call you?
- Calogero.

364
00:31:39,914 --> 00:31:41,609
That makes sense.

365
00:31:42,683 --> 00:31:44,378
Are you a Yankee fan?

366
00:31:47,588 --> 00:31:49,180
Sit down.

367
00:31:51,158 --> 00:31:54,025
Come over here.
Sit next to me.

368
00:31:59,767 --> 00:32:03,032
You must be pretty upset
after the Yankees lost.

369
00:32:03,104 --> 00:32:06,471
Bill Mazeroski, I hate him.

370
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:10,636
He made Mickey Mantle cry.
The papers said the Mick cried.

371
00:32:10,711 --> 00:32:13,407
Mickey Mantle?
That's what you're upset about?

372
00:32:13,481 --> 00:32:16,882
Mantle makes $100,000 a year.
How much does your father make?

373
00:32:16,951 --> 00:32:19,784
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

374
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:23,153
If your dad needs money, go ask
Mickey Mantle. See what happens.

375
00:32:23,224 --> 00:32:26,591
Mickey Mantle don't care about
you. Why care about him?

376
00:32:26,661 --> 00:32:28,060
Nobody cares.

377
00:32:30,131 --> 00:32:31,792
Can I ask you something?

378
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,527
Sure.

379
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:37,637
Did you shoot that man
over a parking space?

380
00:32:42,376 --> 00:32:44,901
When you get older,
you'll understand.

381
00:32:49,317 --> 00:32:53,913
From that day on, I never felt
the same about the Yankees.

382
00:33:14,175 --> 00:33:16,735
I started spending a lot
of time with Sonny.

383
00:33:18,512 --> 00:33:22,573
I would come home from school
and sneak away any chance I got.

384
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:25,175
I would serve the guys drinks and coffee
for tips.

385
00:33:25,252 --> 00:33:28,016
- Bet!
- I'll lay a hundred.

386
00:33:34,662 --> 00:33:36,425
Come on, Sonny!

387
00:33:37,898 --> 00:33:39,729
- Son of a bitch!
- I don't believe it!

388
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,529
I should break his arm.

389
00:33:42,269 --> 00:33:44,601
Here, kid, this is for you.

390
00:33:44,672 --> 00:33:48,904
- Loan me a hundred.
- You know what's gonna happen!

391
00:33:48,976 --> 00:33:51,206
- I feel it! Please!
- Give him a hundred.

392
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:54,736
- I'm in, I'm in!
- Go ahead. Give him the dice.

393
00:33:54,815 --> 00:33:56,373
- Give him the dice.
- I'm in!

394
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:59,317
- It's fucking hot.
- Come on, Mush, make a donation.

395
00:33:59,387 --> 00:34:02,788
- Get this over with, Mush.
- Come on, dice.

396
00:34:02,857 --> 00:34:07,089
Baby needs a new pair of shoes.
Come on, seven!

397
00:34:07,161 --> 00:34:09,322
Come on! Come on, dice!

398
00:34:10,264 --> 00:34:12,892
- And seven!
- I don't even have to look.

399
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:16,061
- Craps! I'm out!
- Get out of here.

400
00:34:17,671 --> 00:34:21,664
- Get him out of here!
- Man never hit a number in his life!

401
00:34:23,244 --> 00:34:25,371
Bring the dice up here.

402
00:34:25,446 --> 00:34:26,208
Where's the kid?

403
00:34:27,314 --> 00:34:31,683
- Put this coffee on my tab?
- Yeah. Get the fuck out of here.

404
00:34:31,752 --> 00:34:35,813
Where's the kid? The kid's
gonna throw the dice for me.

405
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:38,723
Sonny, don't let this kid
throw the dice!

406
00:34:38,793 --> 00:34:42,126
- Anybody got a problem with that?
- No problem.

407
00:34:44,632 --> 00:34:47,226
I want you to throw the dice for me.

408
00:34:47,301 --> 00:34:49,769
- I don't know how to play.
- You don't have to know.

409
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:52,931
You just listen to me.
Hear what I said?

410
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,532
Put 500 down on the kid.

411
00:34:55,609 --> 00:34:57,600
I got a hundred!

412
00:35:05,486 --> 00:35:08,580
Can you stop fucking
leaning on me, please?

413
00:35:08,656 --> 00:35:11,557
- You're breathing all over me.
- Hey, JoJo, relax!

414
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:14,219
I'm trying to get a bet in.
I wanna play too!

415
00:35:15,329 --> 00:35:18,492
You got to hit the wall, kid.
You can do it. Hit the wall.

416
00:35:18,566 --> 00:35:20,534
- You can do it.
- Wait!

417
00:35:22,103 --> 00:35:23,536
I'm betting on Sonny.

418
00:35:23,604 --> 00:35:25,868
I don't want your money
touching mine.

419
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:30,240
What, it's counterfeit?
My money's no good no more? Why?

420
00:35:30,311 --> 00:35:33,109
Because you're
a fucking jinx, that's why!

421
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:36,775
Put him in the bathroom!
Get him out of here!

422
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:42,254
Get in there,
you fucking loser mutt!

423
00:35:42,323 --> 00:35:43,813
Leave him in there!

424
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,557
- A fucking jinx!
- Shoot the dice.

425
00:35:48,863 --> 00:35:50,592
That's a lot of money on you.
Come on.

426
00:35:50,664 --> 00:35:53,690
- Roll a seven. Come on.
- Shoot the fucking dice.

427
00:35:55,603 --> 00:35:57,036
Seven!

428
00:36:00,674 --> 00:36:02,869
Bring the dice up.
Put $1,000 on seven.

429
00:36:10,985 --> 00:36:13,078
You can do it, all right?

430
00:36:13,154 --> 00:36:14,416
You...

431
00:36:14,488 --> 00:36:17,719
Stop fucking breathing on me!
You're killing me over here!

432
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:20,851
I'm on a win streak.
Stop breathing on me!

433
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:23,863
- Put him in the bathroom.
- Eddie's in there. He won't fit.

434
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:27,423
I don't give a fuck!
Put him in there!

435
00:36:37,178 --> 00:36:39,442
Give me a another seven.

436
00:36:39,513 --> 00:36:41,674
Shoot the fucking dice!
Come on!

437
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:46,583
We got a four! That's all right.

438
00:36:46,654 --> 00:36:48,144
Four's what we got.

439
00:36:48,222 --> 00:36:51,783
- Let's go! Shoot the dice!
- Give the kid another shot!

440
00:36:51,859 --> 00:36:54,794
What's wrong with this money?
What, is he crazy?

441
00:36:54,862 --> 00:36:56,056
Is it counterfeit?

442
00:36:57,698 --> 00:37:00,394
I say the kid makes the four.
Give me $500.

443
00:37:00,467 --> 00:37:01,991
Get your bets down.

444
00:37:02,069 --> 00:37:06,335
- Twenty-two on the hard four.
- I'll lay a hundred.

445
00:37:06,407 --> 00:37:09,137
- Who wants a gag on the four?
- One-forty, no gag.

446
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:10,837
Put it down.

447
00:37:10,911 --> 00:37:14,074
- I say he makes the hard four.
- He'll never make it.

448
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:17,584
- Come on. You can do it.
- Don't worry. I'll throw a seven.

449
00:37:17,651 --> 00:37:19,812
- No seven!
- Yeah! Hit a seven!

450
00:37:19,887 --> 00:37:22,412
- Shut up!
- Quiet!

451
00:37:22,489 --> 00:37:27,188
- Do you believe this kid?
- Nobody laughs at this kid.

452
00:37:27,261 --> 00:37:28,990
Seven's are not good now.

453
00:37:29,063 --> 00:37:31,031
- Hit the wall.
- Get a four.

454
00:37:31,098 --> 00:37:33,328
Make the point.
You can do it.

455
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,899
Frankie Coffeecake, no good.

456
00:37:37,972 --> 00:37:40,873
I don't want his face looking
at that face when he's throwing dice.

457
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:44,673
Jimmy, get a towel from the bar.
Put it over his head.

458
00:37:44,745 --> 00:37:47,543
I don't want a towel over
my head. It's embarrassing.

459
00:37:47,615 --> 00:37:50,049
Put him in the fucking bathroom.

460
00:37:50,117 --> 00:37:52,483
Wait a minute. I got money here!

461
00:37:53,554 --> 00:37:55,545
Get the fuck out of here!

462
00:37:55,623 --> 00:37:57,784
- Get him the fuck out!
- Put him in the bathroom.

463
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,382
Get over here.

464
00:38:01,395 --> 00:38:05,559
- Rat bastard locks us in here.
- Very degrading.

465
00:38:05,633 --> 00:38:07,601
I need that point. Listen!

466
00:38:07,668 --> 00:38:10,899
See that money over there?
See that money?

467
00:38:10,971 --> 00:38:14,498
Are we going to make this point?
Come on. Attaboy!

468
00:38:14,575 --> 00:38:18,011
- Come on!
- I need a 2-2 on the hard four.

469
00:38:18,078 --> 00:38:20,740
Hey, don't get cocky, kid!

470
00:38:20,814 --> 00:38:22,179
Fucking kid.

471
00:38:22,249 --> 00:38:24,717
Just make the point. Go ahead.

472
00:38:26,353 --> 00:38:28,617
I don't fucking believe it!
He did it!

473
00:38:30,124 --> 00:38:33,093
Eleven. I made eleven
passes in a row.

474
00:38:35,729 --> 00:38:38,994
I don't know how much money
Sonny won, but it was a lot.

475
00:38:44,505 --> 00:38:46,735
He said the working man
was a sucker...

476
00:38:46,807 --> 00:38:50,368
and I was at the best school:
the University of Belmont Ave.

477
00:38:50,444 --> 00:38:54,437
I was getting two educations:
from the street and from school.

478
00:38:54,515 --> 00:38:57,450
That way I'd be twice as smart
as everybody.

479
00:39:10,864 --> 00:39:13,833
Hey, kid, you did good.

480
00:39:13,901 --> 00:39:16,028
- Thanks.
- Here.

481
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,872
That's it?

482
00:39:21,542 --> 00:39:22,975
Here.

483
00:39:24,478 --> 00:39:26,378
All right?

484
00:39:27,214 --> 00:39:30,308
- Go home. It's getting late.
- See you later.

485
00:39:34,722 --> 00:39:36,656
Listen.

486
00:39:38,158 --> 00:39:40,149
We got to fix your name.

487
00:39:41,628 --> 00:39:43,493
From now on, you're C.

488
00:39:43,564 --> 00:39:45,794
- C?
- That's right. C.

489
00:39:45,866 --> 00:39:47,493
Go home.

490
00:39:47,568 --> 00:39:49,968
So long, Sonny.

491
00:39:50,104 --> 00:39:53,562
Sonny took me everywhere
and introduced me as his boy.

492
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,438
I noticed strange things started
happening in the neighborhood.

493
00:39:56,510 --> 00:40:00,947
Hey, Calogero, come on over.
I want to talk to you.

494
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:04,483
My name is C.

495
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,787
I mean C.

496
00:40:07,855 --> 00:40:11,291
- How are you today, my boy?
- Good.

497
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:13,826
I got nice peaches
for your mom.

498
00:40:13,894 --> 00:40:16,055
I don't have any money.

499
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:18,530
You don't need no money
with me, kid.

500
00:40:19,366 --> 00:40:21,800
Don't embarrass me
like that again.

501
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:26,906
Just tell Sonny
that I took care of you.

502
00:40:32,479 --> 00:40:37,348
I saw it was because of Sonny
that everyone was being so nice.

503
00:40:37,418 --> 00:40:40,581
I liked it.
I liked it a lot.

504
00:40:45,592 --> 00:40:48,789
Mommy, look what I got.
Some peaches for...

505
00:40:49,396 --> 00:40:50,829
free.

506
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:03,002
- What's this?
- What's what, Dad?

507
00:41:03,076 --> 00:41:06,375
Where did you get this? Your mother
found this behind your drawer.

508
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,572
I've been saving.

509
00:41:08,649 --> 00:41:12,050
$600? Did you become
a brain surgeon overnight, son?

510
00:41:12,653 --> 00:41:14,450
Tell your father
where you got the money.

511
00:41:14,521 --> 00:41:17,012
- I worked for it.
- Doing what?

512
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:20,821
- Things.
- "Things"? What do you mean?

513
00:41:20,894 --> 00:41:22,862
Oh, things. You know, things.

514
00:41:23,931 --> 00:41:27,332
Don't lie. Just tell the truth
and I won't get upset.

515
00:41:28,302 --> 00:41:31,430
- Promise?
- Would I say it if I didn't mean it?

516
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,901
I work the crap games for tips.

517
00:41:35,976 --> 00:41:37,910
- Crap games?
- What crap games?

518
00:41:38,812 --> 00:41:40,541
What crap games?
What tips?

519
00:41:41,448 --> 00:41:44,713
- What crap games?
- You said you wouldn't get mad.

520
00:41:44,785 --> 00:41:46,150
I lied. Tell me.

521
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:49,451
- I work for Sonny for tips.
- I knew it.

522
00:41:49,523 --> 00:41:53,015
Weren't you told
not to go near that bar?

523
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:55,118
- But I worked for it.
- What do you mean?

524
00:41:55,195 --> 00:41:57,459
- You're not supposed to go there!
- I'm taking it back.

525
00:41:57,531 --> 00:42:00,398
- I'm bringing it back to the bar.
- Let's just think about it for a minute.

526
00:42:00,467 --> 00:42:03,402
- What are you saying?
- We could use the money.

527
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:05,199
It's not like
he had to do something bad.

528
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:09,072
You know where this comes from. I don't
want him having that kind of money!

529
00:42:09,142 --> 00:42:11,906
- Let's just think about it-
- That's it!

530
00:42:11,979 --> 00:42:14,379
- Come on.
- Wait a minute. Listen to me.

531
00:42:16,016 --> 00:42:20,282
Why do you got to go down
like this? Calm down!

532
00:42:20,354 --> 00:42:22,914
Lorenzo, please!

533
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:24,924
I don't believe this!

534
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:46,573
- Is Sonny around?
- I think he's in the back.

535
00:42:57,724 --> 00:42:59,248
We can't accept that.

536
00:42:59,993 --> 00:43:02,257
Your son worked for it.

537
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:05,389
Right. My son. I don't want him
involved in what goes on here.

538
00:43:05,465 --> 00:43:07,365
Involved in what?

539
00:43:07,434 --> 00:43:10,335
Please, I'm not a stupid man.

540
00:43:10,404 --> 00:43:14,704
- Just stay away from my son.
- Hey, you stay right over here.

541
00:43:14,775 --> 00:43:16,538
C, go outside.

542
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:20,546
I'll speak to my own son.
Calogero, wait outside.

543
00:43:22,849 --> 00:43:25,545
First, I respect you, Lorenzo.
You're a stand-up guy.

544
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:28,884
But don't ever talk to me
like that again.

545
00:43:28,956 --> 00:43:31,220
I tell your son
to go to school...

546
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:35,728
It's not what you say, it's what
he sees- clothes, cars, money.

547
00:43:36,597 --> 00:43:38,531
He threw away
his baseball cards...

548
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:41,090
because Mickey Mantle
would never pay my rent.

549
00:43:41,168 --> 00:43:43,830
He said that?
I don't believe this kid.

550
00:43:43,904 --> 00:43:48,204
That's not funny when he has
a bigger bank account than I do.

551
00:43:48,275 --> 00:43:50,402
I offered you work.
You said no.

552
00:43:50,477 --> 00:43:53,844
And I say no now.
Just leave my son alone.

553
00:43:53,914 --> 00:43:57,543
Don't you see I treat that kid
like he's my son?

554
00:43:57,618 --> 00:44:00,849
He ain't your son.
He's my son!

555
00:44:00,921 --> 00:44:02,980
- Get out!
- I'm not afraid of you.

556
00:44:03,056 --> 00:44:05,354
- You should be.
- I know what you can do.

557
00:44:05,425 --> 00:44:08,724
And I would never
step out of line.

558
00:44:08,795 --> 00:44:12,196
But this time you're wrong.
This is my son, not yours!

559
00:44:12,265 --> 00:44:16,065
You want to fight? Get out or
I'll give you a fucking slap!

560
00:44:16,136 --> 00:44:18,070
Stay away from my son!

561
00:44:18,138 --> 00:44:20,766
- I don't care who you are!
- Get out of here!

562
00:44:21,842 --> 00:44:24,333
- Where's my money?
- It's in there.

563
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:26,208
It was mine!

564
00:44:26,279 --> 00:44:28,907
That's bad money!
You can't have it.

565
00:44:28,982 --> 00:44:32,008
- I earned that money!
- Stay away from him!

566
00:44:32,085 --> 00:44:34,576
- Please listen!
- Stay away from him!

567
00:44:34,655 --> 00:44:38,250
- Dad, listen to me!
- Did you hear me? Stay away!

568
00:44:38,325 --> 00:44:42,261
Sonny was right.
The working man is a sucker.

569
00:44:42,329 --> 00:44:44,593
Wrong! Pulling a trigger
doesn't take strength.

570
00:44:44,665 --> 00:44:48,863
Get up every day and work for a
living! Let's see him try that!

571
00:44:48,935 --> 00:44:51,961
We'll see who's really tough.
The working man is tough.

572
00:44:52,039 --> 00:44:54,303
Your father's the tough guy!

573
00:44:54,374 --> 00:44:57,366
Everybody loves him, just like
everybody loves you on the bus.

574
00:44:57,444 --> 00:45:01,073
No, it's not the same. People
don't love him. They fear him.

575
00:45:01,148 --> 00:45:03,013
There's a difference.

576
00:45:05,385 --> 00:45:07,319
- I'm sorry.
- I don't understand, Dad.

577
00:45:07,387 --> 00:45:10,982
You will.
You will when you get older.

578
00:45:12,726 --> 00:45:14,660
I'm sorry I hit you.

579
00:45:39,219 --> 00:45:42,950
- Should I take care of him?
- No, leave him alone.

580
00:45:44,791 --> 00:45:47,988
Sonny and my father never
spoke to each other again.

581
00:45:48,061 --> 00:45:51,428
I never listened to my father
about staying away from him.

582
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:55,298
The bar was so close.
I'd sneak away any chance I got.

583
00:45:55,368 --> 00:45:59,964
Eight years passed, and
as I grew, Sonny grew in power.

584
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:03,134
He became a boss,
and I was his friend.

585
00:46:20,594 --> 00:46:22,619
Dion was topping the charts.

586
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:24,891
The Beatles were changing
our life-styles.

587
00:46:24,965 --> 00:46:28,264
The Yankees were in last place
and I didn't give a shit.

588
00:46:28,335 --> 00:46:32,101
There was change everywhere, but
my neighborhood was the same.

589
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:37,367
They're off! Kryptonite
comes first from the gate!

590
00:46:37,444 --> 00:46:40,971
- On the outside-
- Here's the kid! We're in!

591
00:46:41,047 --> 00:46:44,744
- C! You get it in?
- Yeah. It's all on Kryptonite.

592
00:46:44,818 --> 00:46:47,981
- You hold them.
- Look at this horse go.

593
00:46:48,054 --> 00:46:51,023
- Come on. Take it home!
- Look at this one move!

594
00:46:51,091 --> 00:46:55,221
- This horse can't lose!
- You can do it, Kryptonite!

595
00:46:55,295 --> 00:46:59,095
It's a lock. Don't even worry
about it. We can't lose.

596
00:46:59,166 --> 00:47:03,159
I'm not even going to look
because I know we can't lose.

597
00:47:03,236 --> 00:47:06,535
- Look! He's pulling away!
- Come on, Kryptonite!

598
00:47:06,606 --> 00:47:08,631
Come on, Kryptonite!
Look at him!

599
00:47:08,708 --> 00:47:11,108
Forget it. It's over.
It's all over.

600
00:47:11,178 --> 00:47:13,009
Let's go!

601
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:16,515
- That's it, Kryptonite!
- Come on, Kryptonite!

602
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:19,916
Bring me luck!
Come on. Bring me luck!

603
00:47:19,986 --> 00:47:22,477
Come on, Kryptonite!
Hang in there!

604
00:47:22,556 --> 00:47:24,956
- Oh, shit!
- Come on! Let's go!

605
00:47:25,025 --> 00:47:28,119
Get the-
He bet the fucking horse?

606
00:47:28,195 --> 00:47:30,857
He bet Kryptonite?
Give me the tickets.

607
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,455
But, Sonny, we're winning.

608
00:47:32,532 --> 00:47:37,367
We can't win. The Mush
bet Kryptonite. Fucking jinx!

609
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:40,873
- We're five lengths in the lead.
- Come on. We've been "mushed."

610
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:44,001
Come on. I got to get away
from this fucking jinx.

611
00:47:44,077 --> 00:47:47,103
- Come on, one!
- Fucking jinx!

612
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:49,205
Come on. You can still do it!

613
00:47:49,282 --> 00:47:52,274
Come on, Kryptonite.
You can still do it!

614
00:47:52,352 --> 00:47:56,311
- Hang in there!
- Come on. Take it home!

615
00:47:56,389 --> 00:47:58,755
Hang in there!

616
00:48:01,261 --> 00:48:03,058
Shit!

617
00:48:03,129 --> 00:48:07,463
- Fuck! This fucking close!
- I don't believe I lost!

618
00:48:07,534 --> 00:48:09,263
I don't fucking believe it!

619
00:48:09,336 --> 00:48:12,305
Hey, C, I got a tip
in the next race for you.

620
00:48:12,372 --> 00:48:14,363
Go fuck yourself!

621
00:48:15,308 --> 00:48:17,242
You're very emotional.

622
00:48:20,313 --> 00:48:23,805
White Birch wins it
in an absolute shocker!

623
00:48:35,395 --> 00:48:38,296
We finally got our own
social club.

624
00:48:38,365 --> 00:48:40,299
We called it the Deuces Wild.

625
00:48:40,367 --> 00:48:44,133
Drinks were a buck
and the jukebox paid the rent.

626
00:48:44,204 --> 00:48:46,138
We only cared
about hanging out.

627
00:48:47,307 --> 00:48:50,037
We would cut class
and hang out all day and night.

628
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:51,907
Nobody wanted to go home...

629
00:48:51,978 --> 00:48:55,675
because you might leave and find
out later you missed something.

630
00:49:00,353 --> 00:49:04,289
Whoa, look at those broads
over there. They're beautiful!

631
00:49:17,137 --> 00:49:19,867
Yo, get over here!
Come here!

632
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:22,636
Put it back in your pants.

633
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:25,542
- Those broads are both pigs.
- How do you know?

634
00:49:25,612 --> 00:49:28,604
- Fuck you, C.
- How the hell do you know?

635
00:49:28,682 --> 00:49:32,140
- They'd fail my test fast.
- What test?

636
00:49:32,218 --> 00:49:36,882
If you want to marry a girl,
she's got to pass the test.

637
00:49:36,957 --> 00:49:40,825
- I call it the Mario test.
- This I got to hear.

638
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:44,660
The test is, you take a girl
for a ride in your car.

639
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:49,600
You pull up to one of them big
18-wheelers on the highway.

640
00:49:49,669 --> 00:49:52,433
You pull alongside it
and get the driver's attention.

641
00:49:52,505 --> 00:49:56,373
Honk your horn. Make sure
he's looking. That's important.

642
00:49:56,443 --> 00:49:59,435
At the same time, put your hand
behind this broad's head...

643
00:49:59,512 --> 00:50:02,276
and push her head down
between your legs.

644
00:50:02,349 --> 00:50:06,308
- Get the fuck out of here.
- It's for her own good.

645
00:50:06,386 --> 00:50:09,321
Now, if this girl
goes down on you...

646
00:50:09,389 --> 00:50:11,789
knowing that truck driver
is watching...

647
00:50:11,858 --> 00:50:14,383
then she's a pig
who can't be trusted.

648
00:50:14,461 --> 00:50:16,361
You're a sick maniac.

649
00:50:16,429 --> 00:50:20,593
When they're into it, they
throw their hair over their ear.

650
00:50:20,667 --> 00:50:24,034
They did it before. Believe me,
they're fucking pros.

651
00:50:39,552 --> 00:50:43,044
That's the second time
those niggers passed today.

652
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:47,924
- Who gives a fuck?
- I give a fuck, that's who.

653
00:50:47,994 --> 00:50:50,588
Did they bother you? No.

654
00:50:50,663 --> 00:50:53,996
Today it's one car, then two,
then it's their neighborhood!

655
00:50:54,067 --> 00:50:57,696
- Then they'll fuck our broads.
- They shouldn't be here. Period.

656
00:50:57,771 --> 00:51:00,399
Invite them in.
Make them have a drink.

657
00:51:00,473 --> 00:51:02,532
Smash their fucking heads.

658
00:51:02,609 --> 00:51:05,635
You want a shot?
Take one. Come back!

659
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:11,545
Louie? Dumps! Get over here!
Where's my money?

660
00:51:11,618 --> 00:51:14,086
I got to do that thing.
I can't...

661
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:18,284
This guy owes me 20 bucks.
It's been two fucking weeks.

662
00:51:18,358 --> 00:51:20,292
You can't dodge me forever!

663
00:51:21,194 --> 00:51:22,923
Fucking piece of shit.

664
00:51:32,939 --> 00:51:34,839
I'll be right back.

665
00:51:34,908 --> 00:51:38,002
- All right, I'll see you.
- Come back.

666
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:46,819
Take a ride with me.

667
00:51:46,886 --> 00:51:49,753
- Do I have to?
- Yeah, you have to. Come on.

668
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:59,061
Sit over here.

669
00:52:07,507 --> 00:52:10,271
This music
gives me a headache.

670
00:52:10,343 --> 00:52:13,608
You kids today don't even know
what good music is.

671
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,477
This is good music.

672
00:52:23,289 --> 00:52:26,224
Want to go to the fights
with me tomorrow?

673
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:34,628
You listening to me?

674
00:52:37,937 --> 00:52:40,303
Can't you call me C?
Everybody does.

675
00:52:40,373 --> 00:52:43,069
Calogero was your grandfather's
name, the name I gave you.

676
00:52:43,143 --> 00:52:46,078
That's why I can't call you
C or whatever it is.

677
00:52:49,482 --> 00:52:51,416
Want to go to the fights?

678
00:52:52,585 --> 00:52:56,578
- Could I let you know tomorrow?
- Do you want to go or not?

679
00:52:57,490 --> 00:53:00,687
- All right, I'll go.
- Don't say it like that.

680
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:04,696
Don't want to twist your arm.
Don't do me a favor.

681
00:54:09,629 --> 00:54:12,325
She was tall,
she was beautiful...

682
00:54:12,398 --> 00:54:14,229
and she was classy.

683
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:16,495
But she was black.

684
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:21,940
And that was a no-no
in my neighborhood.

685
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:44,255
- Jackie, what's the first?
- 2:00, fellas.

686
00:54:44,330 --> 00:54:47,231
- Two. Your friend's number.
- Who?

687
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:49,894
- Your pal.
- Don't fuck around.

688
00:54:49,969 --> 00:54:52,233
- Johnny Biscord bet 228 again?
- That's it.

689
00:54:52,305 --> 00:54:53,772
- Again?
- Again.

690
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:56,633
I'll have better music
next time.

691
00:54:58,044 --> 00:55:00,478
I'm only kidding.
It's okay, Pop.

692
00:55:04,784 --> 00:55:06,547
See you later.

693
00:55:26,539 --> 00:55:29,770
- Louie!
- My grandmother's sick.

694
00:55:29,842 --> 00:55:33,209
I'll talk to you later.
I got to go do something.

695
00:55:33,402 --> 00:55:34,892
Where's my fucking money?

696
00:55:37,506 --> 00:55:40,964
- You're dead, you piece of shit!
- C, come here!

697
00:55:42,244 --> 00:55:44,712
- Get over here.
- He's fucking crazy, this kid.

698
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:48,045
The kid wants his fucking money.
What can you do?

699
00:55:48,117 --> 00:55:51,746
- I got to talk to him.
- You gotta stop babying him.

700
00:55:53,422 --> 00:55:54,889
He owes me money.

701
00:55:54,957 --> 00:55:58,518
- Hit him with a fucking bat.
- Knock him all over the block.

702
00:55:58,594 --> 00:56:02,360
Is that the advice you give
the kid, you fucking hoodlums?

703
00:56:02,431 --> 00:56:05,229
Come on. Don't listen
to these hoodlums.

704
00:56:06,502 --> 00:56:09,369
I'm going to Gino's.
I'll be back.

705
00:56:09,939 --> 00:56:11,668
What's the matter?

706
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:14,106
This Louie Dumps
owes me 20 dollars.

707
00:56:14,176 --> 00:56:18,579
It's been two weeks, and whenever
he sees me he keeps dodging me.

708
00:56:18,647 --> 00:56:22,105
He's becoming a pain in the ass.
Should I crack him one?

709
00:56:22,184 --> 00:56:25,017
What's the matter?
What have I been telling you?

710
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:27,817
Sometimes hurting somebody
ain't the answer.

711
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:32,156
- Is he a good friend of yours?
- No, I don't even like him.

712
00:56:32,228 --> 00:56:34,196
There's your answer right there.

713
00:56:34,263 --> 00:56:37,255
It costs you 20 dollars
to get rid of him.

714
00:56:37,333 --> 00:56:41,235
He's never bother you again. He's never
gonna ask you for money again.

715
00:56:41,303 --> 00:56:44,238
He's out of your life for
20 dollars. You got off cheap.

716
00:56:44,306 --> 00:56:46,240
You're always right.

717
00:56:46,308 --> 00:56:50,574
If I was, I wouldn't have
done 10 years in the joint.

718
00:56:50,646 --> 00:56:52,739
What did you do every day?

719
00:56:52,815 --> 00:56:55,283
There's only three things
to do in the joint, kid:

720
00:56:55,351 --> 00:56:57,842
lift weights, play cards
or get into trouble.

721
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,582
- What did you do?
- Me? I read.

722
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:03,123
What did you read?

723
00:57:03,859 --> 00:57:06,726
- Ever hear of Machiavelli?
- Who?

724
00:57:06,795 --> 00:57:09,662
He's a famous writer
from 500 years ago.

725
00:57:09,732 --> 00:57:12,030
Availability.
That's what he always said.

726
00:57:12,101 --> 00:57:15,229
- Availability?
- That's right. Listen to me.

727
00:57:16,272 --> 00:57:19,241
You know why I live
in this neighborhood?

728
00:57:19,308 --> 00:57:20,707
Availability.

729
00:57:20,776 --> 00:57:23,142
I want to stay close
to everything...

730
00:57:23,212 --> 00:57:26,113
because being on the spot,
I can see trouble immediately.

731
00:57:26,181 --> 00:57:29,150
Trouble is like a cancer.
You got to get it early.

732
00:57:29,218 --> 00:57:31,709
Otherwise it gets big
and kills you.

733
00:57:31,787 --> 00:57:33,618
You got to cut it out.

734
00:57:36,692 --> 00:57:38,717
You're worried about
Louie Dumps.

735
00:57:38,794 --> 00:57:40,728
Nobody cares.

736
00:57:42,731 --> 00:57:46,633
Worry about yourself, your family,
the people that are important to you.

737
00:57:46,702 --> 00:57:49,535
That's what it comes down to:
availability.

738
00:57:49,605 --> 00:57:53,473
The people that see me every day
that are on my side...

739
00:57:53,542 --> 00:57:56,306
they feel safe
because they know I'm close.

740
00:57:56,378 --> 00:57:59,142
That gives them
more reason to love me.

741
00:57:59,214 --> 00:58:02,877
The people that want to do otherwise,
they think twice...

742
00:58:02,952 --> 00:58:04,715
because they know I'm close.

743
00:58:04,787 --> 00:58:07,153
That gives them
more reason to fear me.

744
00:58:07,222 --> 00:58:09,554
Is it better
to be loved or feared?

745
00:58:10,993 --> 00:58:13,018
That's a good question.

746
00:58:13,095 --> 00:58:15,689
It's nice to be both,
but it's difficult.

747
00:58:15,764 --> 00:58:17,994
But if I had my choice...

748
00:58:18,067 --> 00:58:20,126
I would rather be feared.

749
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:23,631
Fear lasts longer than love.

750
00:58:23,706 --> 00:58:26,106
Friendships bought with money
mean nothing.

751
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:29,235
You see how it is.
I make a joke, everybody laughs.

752
00:58:29,311 --> 00:58:31,302
I'm funny, but not that funny.

753
00:58:32,715 --> 00:58:36,549
Fear keeps them loyal to me.
The trick is not being hated.

754
00:58:37,319 --> 00:58:41,585
I treat my men good. But if I
give too much, I'm not needed.

755
00:58:41,657 --> 00:58:44,751
I give just enough where they need me
but don't hate me.

756
00:58:46,395 --> 00:58:48,420
Don't forget what I'm telling you.

757
00:58:50,432 --> 00:58:53,663
Sonny, I got some
beautiful veal chops today.

758
00:58:53,736 --> 00:58:56,330
I got some nice linguine...

759
00:58:56,405 --> 00:58:59,670
and I got
some beautiful sauce.

760
00:59:42,317 --> 00:59:44,581
You're not dressed properly.
You'll have to leave.

761
00:59:44,653 --> 00:59:46,814
What's wrong
with how we're dressed?

762
00:59:46,889 --> 00:59:49,949
These gentlemen ain't dressed
right. I asked them to leave.

763
00:59:50,025 --> 00:59:51,959
Is there a problem?

764
00:59:52,027 --> 00:59:56,327
He's acting like our money ain't
green. We just want some beers.

765
00:59:56,398 --> 00:59:58,332
A few beers, that's it?

766
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,336
That's it. We'll be on our way.
We ain't looking for trouble.

767
01:00:02,404 --> 01:00:04,463
Spoken like a gentleman.
Give them their beers.

768
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:06,235
- I appreciate that.
- No problem.

769
01:00:10,646 --> 01:00:12,580
Here you go.

770
01:00:12,648 --> 01:00:15,242
You got some brews down here?
Nice cold ones.

771
01:00:17,653 --> 01:00:19,086
Two over here, huh?

772
01:00:21,924 --> 01:00:26,190
One more beer.
Got some thirsty people here.

773
01:00:26,261 --> 01:00:30,630
All right, brothers.
If I may, a toast to our host.

774
01:00:30,699 --> 01:00:34,100
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost!

775
01:00:34,169 --> 01:00:36,399
Get wet, you dago wop!

776
01:00:36,472 --> 01:00:39,373
Look at all this shit
all over me!

777
01:00:42,377 --> 01:00:44,311
Oh, you again, huh?

778
01:00:44,379 --> 01:00:46,939
That wasn't very nice.
Now you got to leave.

779
01:00:47,015 --> 01:00:49,984
I'll tell you when the fuck
we leave. Get away from me.

780
01:00:54,289 --> 01:00:56,780
Hey, watch the bikes, man.

781
01:00:56,859 --> 01:01:00,386
- What's going on here?
- Come on!

782
01:01:03,832 --> 01:01:06,596
- This is half empty.
- What's this shit?

783
01:01:06,668 --> 01:01:09,000
What's going on here?

784
01:01:12,174 --> 01:01:13,641
Now you can't leave.

785
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:17,372
I will never forget
the look on their faces.

786
01:01:17,446 --> 01:01:21,473
All eight of them.
Their faces dropped.

787
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:24,178
All their courage and strength
was drained from their bodies.

788
01:01:26,155 --> 01:01:29,181
They had a reputation
for breaking up bars.

789
01:01:29,258 --> 01:01:32,421
But they knew that instant
they made a fatal mistake.

790
01:01:32,494 --> 01:01:34,223
This time, they walked
into the wrong bar.

791
01:01:34,296 --> 01:01:36,628
Come on, motherfucker!

792
01:01:57,452 --> 01:01:59,283
Crack his fucking head open!

793
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:20,499
You fucking creep!

794
01:02:36,391 --> 01:02:38,188
Step on his head!

795
01:02:40,929 --> 01:02:43,591
Get them out of here!

796
01:02:43,665 --> 01:02:46,099
Drag them the fuck out!
Move it!

797
01:02:55,577 --> 01:02:56,805
Watch my car!

798
01:03:03,919 --> 01:03:05,580
Fucking punks!

799
01:03:06,955 --> 01:03:09,549
Get him!
Grab that hairy bastard!

800
01:03:09,625 --> 01:03:11,058
Let the kids kill them.

801
01:03:11,126 --> 01:03:14,721
- Hit him!
- Get away!

802
01:03:17,633 --> 01:03:19,567
Kick him in his face!

803
01:03:19,635 --> 01:03:21,102
Here, you motherfucker!

804
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:23,728
Look at me.

805
01:03:23,805 --> 01:03:27,036
I'm the one who did this
to you. Remember me.

806
01:03:29,678 --> 01:03:32,272
Come on, Sonny!
Let's go, you guys!

807
01:03:33,982 --> 01:03:38,146
- They ruined my lunch!
- Let's get out of here!

808
01:03:40,689 --> 01:03:43,123
Leave them there
like the dogs that they are.

809
01:03:47,095 --> 01:03:49,586
They ruined my whole
fucking lunch! Come on!

810
01:04:05,370 --> 01:04:07,736
Take a look at this gun
right here.

811
01:04:07,806 --> 01:04:09,535
It's a.45.

812
01:04:09,608 --> 01:04:12,099
This thing could stop
an elephant driving a truck...

813
01:04:12,177 --> 01:04:13,644
and the truck too.

814
01:04:13,712 --> 01:04:15,805
Nicky Zero
was the neighborhood thief.

815
01:04:15,881 --> 01:04:18,816
His mother called him Zero. She
said he'd never amount to nothing.

816
01:04:18,884 --> 01:04:20,818
It's too big.
Where will you hide it?

817
01:04:20,886 --> 01:04:23,946
- Then you want this one.
- They can spot that.

818
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:28,023
- You need this.
- What is wrong with you?

819
01:04:28,093 --> 01:04:29,492
Don't point the gun.

820
01:04:29,561 --> 01:04:31,825
It's on safety.
I won't kill you.

821
01:04:31,897 --> 01:04:35,333
Don't ever do that.
Now let me see the fucking gun.

822
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:39,302
- This is you. This is class.
- I don't know.

823
01:04:39,371 --> 01:04:42,306
- What's this?
- Let me see this.

824
01:04:43,441 --> 01:04:44,908
Feels nice.

825
01:04:44,976 --> 01:04:46,443
Right there. Feel it.

826
01:04:46,511 --> 01:04:49,275
I wanna shoot somebody,
you know what I mean?

827
01:04:49,347 --> 01:04:52,475
I wanna shoot somebody too.
That's the gun for it.

828
01:04:52,551 --> 01:04:54,610
- What are you guys doing?
- You think so?

829
01:04:54,686 --> 01:04:58,019
What's going on?
Are you stupid or something?

830
01:04:58,089 --> 01:05:00,216
Are you fucking stupid
or something?

831
01:05:00,292 --> 01:05:03,557
What's the matter with you,
selling guns around here?

832
01:05:03,628 --> 01:05:07,029
You'll make this whole place hot
and get us all fucking pinched.

833
01:05:07,098 --> 01:05:08,690
Get out of here!

834
01:05:10,635 --> 01:05:13,502
Stay over here. Don't move.
All of you. Stay right there.

835
01:05:13,572 --> 01:05:16,939
I want no guns. You hear me?
Get out of here!

836
01:05:17,008 --> 01:05:19,135
C, get over here!

837
01:05:19,210 --> 01:05:21,144
Come here.
I want to talk to you.

838
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:32,112
- Sonny, loan me 500.
- Tomorrow.

839
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:41,963
You think you're a tough guy
with these guns, is that it?

840
01:05:42,033 --> 01:05:44,297
No, but after what happened
in the bar, I thought...

841
01:05:44,369 --> 01:05:47,133
You think a gun
makes you a tough guy?

842
01:05:47,205 --> 01:05:50,902
I seen more guys with guns
wet the bed than anything.

843
01:05:50,976 --> 01:05:53,035
It's when the other guy
pulls out his gun.

844
01:05:53,111 --> 01:05:55,045
Then we see
who the tough guy is.

845
01:05:55,113 --> 01:05:56,603
You don't understand.

846
01:05:56,681 --> 01:05:58,672
I do understand.
This shit is not for you.

847
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:00,684
Those kids are gonna
get you in trouble.

848
01:06:00,752 --> 01:06:02,583
But they're my friends.
You know that.

849
01:06:02,654 --> 01:06:04,747
They're jerk-offs.

850
01:06:04,823 --> 01:06:06,723
Look at me.

851
01:06:06,791 --> 01:06:08,383
Jerk-offs.

852
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:10,894
And Slick is
the biggest jerk-off.

853
01:06:11,963 --> 01:06:13,521
What have been telling you?

854
01:06:13,598 --> 01:06:16,624
"Stay in school.
Get two educations." I know.

855
01:06:16,701 --> 01:06:19,534
That's right.
Don't do what I do.

856
01:06:19,604 --> 01:06:22,471
This is my life, not yours.

857
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:24,872
I do what I have to do.
This is not for you.

858
01:06:25,944 --> 01:06:27,912
All right. I'm sorry.

859
01:06:32,017 --> 01:06:34,508
Want to go to the fights
with me tomorrow?

860
01:06:34,586 --> 01:06:36,053
I don't know.

861
01:06:36,121 --> 01:06:38,715
I got a piece of
a good middleweight.

862
01:06:38,790 --> 01:06:40,724
Come with me.
We'll sit in front.

863
01:06:40,792 --> 01:06:44,558
I would like to come, but I told
my father I would go with him.

864
01:06:44,629 --> 01:06:47,393
You know where I'm sitting.
Come by and say hello.

865
01:06:47,465 --> 01:06:50,298
- All right.
- You know where I'm sitting.

866
01:07:00,011 --> 01:07:01,478
Sit here.

867
01:07:03,581 --> 01:07:06,243
Nice seats.
I hope I don't get a nosebleed.

868
01:07:06,317 --> 01:07:08,945
These are the best I can do.
What do you want?

869
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:10,510
I'm only kidding.

870
01:07:41,086 --> 01:07:43,520
Hi, C. How are you doing?
Hello, Lorenzo.

871
01:07:43,588 --> 01:07:45,021
How are you doing?

872
01:07:45,090 --> 01:07:49,527
Sonny has a couple of ringside
seats for you. Come on down.

873
01:07:53,631 --> 01:07:56,156
Tell him thanks,
but we're good where we are.

874
01:08:00,271 --> 01:08:02,637
Tell Sonny thanks,
but we're good where we are.

875
01:08:02,707 --> 01:08:06,040
You're welcome to come down.
You know where the seats are.

876
01:08:06,111 --> 01:08:08,341
Anytime during the fight. Okay?

877
01:08:08,413 --> 01:08:10,347
Okay. Thanks.

878
01:08:10,415 --> 01:08:13,509
Introducing the principals
for this evening's main event.

879
01:08:13,585 --> 01:08:16,577
He's got seats for us.
He's trying to be our friend.

880
01:08:16,654 --> 01:08:19,589
I like my seat. I paid for it.
You want to go down there, go.

881
01:08:21,259 --> 01:08:23,489
Go ahead. Go down there.

882
01:08:23,561 --> 01:08:25,552
Welcome
Eric "The Rock Man" Holland!

883
01:08:29,734 --> 01:08:32,168
I bring you,
and you want to go with them.

884
01:08:32,237 --> 01:08:34,228
Go with them.

885
01:08:34,305 --> 01:08:36,705
You think I want to sit with you
when you want to be with them?

886
01:08:36,775 --> 01:08:39,266
From the Bronx, New York...

887
01:08:39,344 --> 01:08:41,869
How do you think
that makes me feel?

888
01:08:41,946 --> 01:08:43,379
Joe Carey!

889
01:08:49,354 --> 01:08:51,288
I'm sorry if I hurt you, Dad.

890
01:09:00,632 --> 01:09:02,497
Everything I've been
telling you.

891
01:09:21,186 --> 01:09:24,815
He's been avoiding me. When I
see him, I'll break his face.

892
01:09:24,889 --> 01:09:27,323
- Do you like him?
- He's a jerk-off!

893
01:09:27,392 --> 01:09:29,860
Ten dollars. You got off cheap.
He's out of your life.

894
01:09:29,928 --> 01:09:32,795
I'm still going to
fucking break his face.

895
01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:42,569
I couldn't believe it.
She was right in front of me.

896
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:46,337
I never forgot her since I
saw her on my father's bus.

897
01:09:46,411 --> 01:09:48,436
I wanted to talk to her,
but she was with her friends...

898
01:09:48,513 --> 01:09:50,447
and I was with mine.

899
01:09:52,851 --> 01:09:58,585
I only have eyes

900
01:09:58,656 --> 01:10:03,650
For you

901
01:10:03,728 --> 01:10:07,095
Dear

902
01:10:08,633 --> 01:10:12,831
This fucking doo-wop.
I want to strangle one of them.

903
01:10:15,974 --> 01:10:21,571
My love must be a kind
of blind love

904
01:10:23,982 --> 01:10:29,113
I can't see anyone but you

905
01:10:29,187 --> 01:10:32,918
- Let's get something to eat.
- This fat bastard ate it all.

906
01:10:32,991 --> 01:10:34,925
What's wrong with you?
You're always eating.

907
01:10:34,993 --> 01:10:38,690
- I was hungry.
- Did you read about the bikers?

908
01:10:38,763 --> 01:10:40,321
- No.
- I was reading the paper.

909
01:10:40,398 --> 01:10:43,265
You see the way Jimmy
was hitting them?

910
01:10:43,334 --> 01:10:46,565
- What about Danny with that pipe?
- I don't know.

911
01:10:46,638 --> 01:10:49,072
- Let's get out of here.
- You wanna get out of here?

912
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:51,074
Come on. Let's go.

913
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:54,175
Come on, C.

914
01:10:54,245 --> 01:10:56,975
- I can't come. I got a test.
- Fuck the test.

915
01:10:57,048 --> 01:10:58,982
I missed it last week.

916
01:10:59,050 --> 01:11:02,508
You sure? All right.
We'll be at The Deuces.

917
01:11:02,587 --> 01:11:07,786
Are the stars out tonight

918
01:11:09,427 --> 01:11:15,263
I don't know
if it's cloudy or bright

919
01:11:15,333 --> 01:11:21,272
I only have eyes

920
01:11:21,339 --> 01:11:26,572
For you

921
01:11:26,644 --> 01:11:28,578
Dear

922
01:11:36,154 --> 01:11:40,090
We were alone for the first time.
I knew I had to say something to her.

923
01:11:40,158 --> 01:11:42,092
This chance
might never come again.

924
01:11:44,195 --> 01:11:48,256
I wanted to be cool, but I still
didn't even know her name.

925
01:11:48,333 --> 01:11:50,631
I said to myself, "She must
have an exotic name...

926
01:11:50,702 --> 01:11:52,294
like Monique or Danielle."

927
01:11:59,677 --> 01:12:01,542
You go to this school?

928
01:12:01,612 --> 01:12:03,273
I'm Jane.

929
01:12:04,215 --> 01:12:07,446
- Jane? That's your name?
- Yeah. What's wrong with that?

930
01:12:07,518 --> 01:12:10,112
Nothing. It's a great name.
I love that name.

931
01:12:10,188 --> 01:12:12,213
I just moved here.

932
01:12:12,290 --> 01:12:14,656
I seen you on the bus
the other day.

933
01:12:14,726 --> 01:12:16,250
And you are?

934
01:12:16,327 --> 01:12:18,158
I'm Calogero.

935
01:12:18,229 --> 01:12:19,662
Ca-who?

936
01:12:21,532 --> 01:12:23,898
- What kind of name is that?
- It's Italian.

937
01:12:23,968 --> 01:12:27,062
Actually, it's Sicilian.
My family's from Sicily.

938
01:12:27,138 --> 01:12:28,833
Sicily?

939
01:12:28,906 --> 01:12:31,272
You know where Italy is?
It's the boot that comes down.

940
01:12:31,342 --> 01:12:33,640
The island next to it that looks
like it's getting kicked...

941
01:12:33,711 --> 01:12:35,144
is Sicily.

942
01:12:35,213 --> 01:12:37,841
- I like Italians.
- You do?

943
01:12:40,651 --> 01:12:42,175
Are you waiting for someone?

944
01:12:42,253 --> 01:12:45,188
- Yes, I am.
- Oh, you are.

945
01:12:45,256 --> 01:12:47,781
All right.
Well, I better go.

946
01:12:50,228 --> 01:12:52,253
Wait.

947
01:12:52,330 --> 01:12:54,264
I was just waiting
for my brother.

948
01:12:54,332 --> 01:12:56,630
Sometimes we walk home together.

949
01:12:56,701 --> 01:12:59,169
If it's no problem,
I could walk you home.

950
01:13:00,438 --> 01:13:03,202
I live down Webster Avenue.
Is that all right?

951
01:13:04,275 --> 01:13:06,743
That's no problem.
Come on. Let's go.

952
01:13:08,413 --> 01:13:10,244
So you wait for your brother?

953
01:13:11,315 --> 01:13:14,045
- That's great.
- What's so great about it?

954
01:13:14,118 --> 01:13:16,609
What's so great about it?
It's just great.

955
01:13:19,424 --> 01:13:21,358
Where did you get that hat from?

956
01:13:21,426 --> 01:13:24,623
- You don't like this hat?
- It's funny-looking.

957
01:13:24,695 --> 01:13:27,630
Maybe it will look better
another way. Hold this.

958
01:13:37,141 --> 01:13:39,132
You have beautiful eyes.

959
01:13:40,645 --> 01:13:42,340
Thanks. So do you.

960
01:13:47,385 --> 01:13:49,080
That's better.

961
01:13:50,988 --> 01:13:52,979
Do you want to go to the movies?

962
01:13:53,057 --> 01:13:55,958
You want to go
to the movies with me?

963
01:13:56,027 --> 01:13:58,552
Yeah. I told you
I liked Italians.

964
01:13:58,629 --> 01:14:00,927
You want to go right now?

965
01:14:00,998 --> 01:14:02,863
No, of course not now.

966
01:14:03,935 --> 01:14:05,869
How about tomorrow?

967
01:14:05,937 --> 01:14:08,235
6:00. We'll meet in front.

968
01:14:08,306 --> 01:14:10,706
I'll be waiting here
till tomorrow then.

969
01:14:14,645 --> 01:14:17,739
Oh, I'm sorry. I mean I'll
meet you in front tomorrow.

970
01:14:19,283 --> 01:14:21,615
Sorry I'm saying stupid stuff.
I'm so nervous.

971
01:14:23,387 --> 01:14:26,914
You're not saying stupid things.
You're doing okay.

972
01:14:26,991 --> 01:14:28,686
You think so?

973
01:14:30,194 --> 01:14:32,321
Where are you originally from?

974
01:14:32,396 --> 01:14:34,591
- Brooklyn.
- What part?

975
01:14:34,665 --> 01:14:36,462
- East New York.
- Where's that?

976
01:14:36,534 --> 01:14:38,559
It's far. Way out.

977
01:14:38,636 --> 01:14:41,764
I got relatives in Brooklyn.
I never heard of that part.

978
01:14:41,839 --> 01:14:44,103
- Really?
- Yeah.

979
01:14:44,175 --> 01:14:47,542
- I suppose they're Italian too.
- Yeah.

980
01:14:47,612 --> 01:14:49,045
That figures.

981
01:14:49,113 --> 01:14:51,081
- What's your last name?
- Williams.

982
01:14:51,149 --> 01:14:53,140
Very easy. Very simple.

983
01:14:53,217 --> 01:14:57,711
Jane Williams.
That's a pretty easy name to say.

984
01:14:57,788 --> 01:14:59,881
Can't say mine's that easy.

985
01:14:59,957 --> 01:15:01,754
Wait. Let me see.

986
01:15:01,826 --> 01:15:05,626
Calogero Anello?

987
01:15:05,696 --> 01:15:07,357
- Yeah.
- Got it.

988
01:15:07,431 --> 01:15:09,126
My friends call me C.

989
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:11,191
I like Calogero better.

990
01:15:15,072 --> 01:15:16,596
These books are heavy.

991
01:15:17,775 --> 01:15:19,834
That's why I'm glad
you're carrying them.

992
01:15:52,710 --> 01:15:54,143
Well...

993
01:15:55,379 --> 01:15:57,244
I guess this is it.

994
01:15:57,315 --> 01:16:00,182
- I really had a great time.
- Me too.

995
01:16:01,552 --> 01:16:04,350
- I think you're very nice.
- Thanks. So are you.

996
01:16:05,356 --> 01:16:07,153
Thank you.

997
01:16:10,528 --> 01:16:12,462
Sorry I can't walk you
all the way home.

998
01:16:12,530 --> 01:16:15,465
That's all right.
I only live a block down.

999
01:16:16,801 --> 01:16:20,293
- I'll see you tomorrow?
- Tomorrow.

1000
01:16:20,371 --> 01:16:22,635
Tomorrow night? 6:00?

1001
01:16:23,441 --> 01:16:24,965
You're getting better.

1002
01:16:25,042 --> 01:16:26,907
I just wanted to double-check.

1003
01:16:28,246 --> 01:16:30,680
Well. Bye.

1004
01:17:10,087 --> 01:17:12,612
What is it, white motherfucker?

1005
01:17:25,436 --> 01:17:26,926
Come on, Aldo.

1006
01:17:30,374 --> 01:17:33,241
That was a late fucking finger.

1007
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:35,404
Was it late, man? Tell me.

1008
01:17:35,479 --> 01:17:37,572
What are you talking about?

1009
01:17:37,648 --> 01:17:40,583
Go ahead! This fucking kid
keeps winning my money!

1010
01:17:40,651 --> 01:17:43,916
I'm going to curse him now.
He won't win anymore.

1011
01:17:43,988 --> 01:17:47,082
He's got all my money.
How am I going to play?

1012
01:17:47,158 --> 01:17:49,649
He won't win anymore. Watch.

1013
01:17:53,130 --> 01:17:54,825
What the fuck, man?

1014
01:17:57,201 --> 01:17:59,635
These fucking spooks can't ride
in their own neighborhood?

1015
01:17:59,704 --> 01:18:01,171
Just leave them alone.

1016
01:18:01,238 --> 01:18:03,638
What is it with you
and these niggers lately?

1017
01:18:03,708 --> 01:18:06,336
- They ain't bothering nobody.
- They're bothering me.

1018
01:18:06,410 --> 01:18:07,672
Not me.

1019
01:18:14,151 --> 01:18:16,415
This is our neighborhood,
you black bastard!

1020
01:18:20,691 --> 01:18:22,283
Let's get these niggers!

1021
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:25,261
Get the fuck
out of our neighborhood!

1022
01:18:25,329 --> 01:18:27,490
- Let's get out of here!
- Get him!

1023
01:18:33,437 --> 01:18:34,870
Black bastard!

1024
01:18:41,912 --> 01:18:44,005
C, come here!

1025
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:48,779
Leave me alone!

1026
01:18:50,187 --> 01:18:52,553
Grab him, C!
Get this motherfucker!

1027
01:18:52,623 --> 01:18:54,284
- Stay down!
- I didn't do anything!

1028
01:18:54,358 --> 01:18:57,020
I won't hurt you. Stay down.
I don't want to hurt you.

1029
01:18:57,094 --> 01:18:58,789
Get him!

1030
01:19:05,236 --> 01:19:06,396
Motherfucker!

1031
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:09,405
What are you doing,
dancing with him? Get off!

1032
01:19:11,442 --> 01:19:14,707
Get out of here, crazy bastards.
The cops are coming.

1033
01:19:14,779 --> 01:19:16,747
I can see them. Go!

1034
01:19:16,814 --> 01:19:19,214
- I can see the lights.
- Get off him!

1035
01:19:19,283 --> 01:19:22,343
They called the cops! Come one!
Let's go!

1036
01:19:22,420 --> 01:19:24,047
They called the cops!

1037
01:19:24,121 --> 01:19:26,214
What are you doing?

1038
01:19:26,290 --> 01:19:28,588
- You're going to kill him!
- I don't care.

1039
01:19:28,659 --> 01:19:30,650
I want to kill him!

1040
01:19:30,728 --> 01:19:32,559
- The cops are coming!
- Fuck that!

1041
01:19:34,331 --> 01:19:36,265
They called the fucking cops!
Come on!

1042
01:19:47,311 --> 01:19:49,279
Didn't I tell you Slick
was nothing but trouble?

1043
01:19:49,346 --> 01:19:51,439
Yeah, but he's my friend.

1044
01:19:52,783 --> 01:19:54,774
He's your friend.
I'm your friend, kid.

1045
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:58,145
You're letting yourself
get caught up in this shit.

1046
01:19:58,222 --> 01:20:00,213
These kids could hurt you.
Think for yourself.

1047
01:20:02,626 --> 01:20:05,288
I'm trying,
but we hate these people.

1048
01:20:05,362 --> 01:20:07,296
I don't hate them,
but, you know.

1049
01:20:07,364 --> 01:20:10,094
What people?
What's on your mind?

1050
01:20:10,167 --> 01:20:12,692
- I met this girl.
- Yeah? So?

1051
01:20:12,770 --> 01:20:16,206
I like her and everything,
but she ain't white.

1052
01:20:16,273 --> 01:20:17,797
She's from Webster Avenue.

1053
01:20:17,875 --> 01:20:20,605
- She's a colored girl.
- Yeah.

1054
01:20:20,678 --> 01:20:22,043
You like her?

1055
01:20:22,112 --> 01:20:24,239
I do, but I don't want
to hear the guys.

1056
01:20:24,315 --> 01:20:28,445
Fuck them. Half of them
are gonna end up dead or in jail.

1057
01:20:28,519 --> 01:20:30,453
Nobody cares.

1058
01:20:30,521 --> 01:20:32,648
All that matters
is what's good for you...

1059
01:20:32,723 --> 01:20:34,714
and how you feel
about each other.

1060
01:20:36,494 --> 01:20:38,223
Let me tell you something.

1061
01:20:38,295 --> 01:20:39,956
When you're alone,
late at night in bed...

1062
01:20:40,030 --> 01:20:41,998
just you and her
under the covers...

1063
01:20:42,066 --> 01:20:43,829
that's all that matters.

1064
01:20:43,901 --> 01:20:46,597
You got to do what your heart
tells you to do.

1065
01:20:46,670 --> 01:20:48,831
I'll tell you something.

1066
01:20:48,906 --> 01:20:51,101
You're only allowed three
great women in your lifetime.

1067
01:20:52,209 --> 01:20:55,474
They come along like great
fighters, once every ten years.

1068
01:20:55,546 --> 01:20:58,640
Rocky Marciano.
Sugar Ray Robinson. Joe Louis.

1069
01:20:59,917 --> 01:21:01,782
Sometimes you get them
all at once.

1070
01:21:01,852 --> 01:21:04,980
Me? I had my three
when I was 16. That happens.

1071
01:21:05,055 --> 01:21:07,683
What are you gonna do?

1072
01:21:07,758 --> 01:21:09,419
That's the way it goes, you know?

1073
01:21:09,493 --> 01:21:12,326
Tell you right now.
See this girl?

1074
01:21:13,430 --> 01:21:15,523
Maybe this girl
puts wind in your sails.

1075
01:21:18,035 --> 01:21:19,969
Maybe she's
your first great one.

1076
01:21:20,037 --> 01:21:22,301
Thanks, Sonny.
I think I'll go for it.

1077
01:21:22,373 --> 01:21:26,309
- Is she a good kid?
- I just met her. I hope so.

1078
01:21:26,377 --> 01:21:28,538
Tomorrow you borrow my car.

1079
01:21:28,612 --> 01:21:31,206
- You don't lend it to anybody.
- I'll lend it to you.

1080
01:21:31,282 --> 01:21:33,216
I want you to make
a good impression.

1081
01:21:33,284 --> 01:21:35,514
You borrow my car,
and you give her the test.

1082
01:21:35,586 --> 01:21:37,349
The "Mario test"?

1083
01:21:37,421 --> 01:21:40,584
Mario's a psycho.
Why do you listen to him?

1084
01:21:40,658 --> 01:21:42,956
Give her my test,
the door test.

1085
01:21:43,027 --> 01:21:45,018
- What's that?
- Listen to me.

1086
01:21:45,095 --> 01:21:47,586
You pull up
right where she is.

1087
01:21:47,665 --> 01:21:50,657
Before you get out of the car,
lock both doors.

1088
01:21:50,734 --> 01:21:53,794
You get out of the car,
you walk over to her.

1089
01:21:53,871 --> 01:21:55,805
You bring her over to the car.

1090
01:21:55,873 --> 01:21:58,933
You take out the key, unlock it,
open the door for her.

1091
01:21:59,009 --> 01:22:01,773
You let her get in.
Then you close the door for her.

1092
01:22:01,845 --> 01:22:04,871
You walk behind the car and
look through the rear window.

1093
01:22:04,949 --> 01:22:07,543
If she doesn't reach over and
lift up that button for you...

1094
01:22:07,618 --> 01:22:09,552
so you can get in,
dump her.

1095
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:11,850
- Just like that?
- Listen to me, kid.

1096
01:22:11,922 --> 01:22:14,550
If she doesn't reach over,
lift up that button for you...

1097
01:22:14,625 --> 01:22:18,721
she's a selfish broad and all
you're seeing is the tip of the iceberg.

1098
01:22:18,796 --> 01:22:21,026
You dump her fast.

1099
01:22:21,098 --> 01:22:23,066
What about the beautiful things
you just told me?

1100
01:22:23,133 --> 01:22:25,158
Do what my heart tells me to do.

1101
01:22:25,235 --> 01:22:28,671
Find someone to put wind in my
sails. She could be a great one.

1102
01:22:28,739 --> 01:22:31,230
Bullshit, kid.
The door test is what counts.

1103
01:22:31,308 --> 01:22:33,333
You dump her,
and you dump her fast.

1104
01:22:33,410 --> 01:22:35,742
- Dump her?
- Dump her.

1105
01:22:48,325 --> 01:22:51,021
- Dad. Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

1106
01:22:53,731 --> 01:22:56,461
I need your opinion. You know
Joey Osso from down the block?

1107
01:22:57,835 --> 01:23:00,395
He asked me what I thought
about him dating a colored girl.

1108
01:23:00,471 --> 01:23:03,872
- What do you think?
- Joey can't find white girls?

1109
01:23:03,941 --> 01:23:06,876
That's not a good answer.
What's the problem?

1110
01:23:06,944 --> 01:23:08,878
I get along with everybody
on the bus...

1111
01:23:08,946 --> 01:23:12,473
but when it comes to marriage,
we should marry within our own.

1112
01:23:12,549 --> 01:23:16,485
- You know I'm not prejudiced.
- Don't tell me that. You are.

1113
01:23:16,553 --> 01:23:19,420
What would you say if I wanted
to date a colored girl?

1114
01:23:19,490 --> 01:23:21,253
You would never do that.

1115
01:23:21,325 --> 01:23:23,725
You never know. This girl
might be one of the great ones.

1116
01:23:23,794 --> 01:23:27,161
You're only allowed three
great women in your lifetime.

1117
01:23:27,231 --> 01:23:29,893
- Who told you that?
- Joey Osso.

1118
01:23:34,405 --> 01:23:37,966
You tell him that sometimes
in the heat of passion...

1119
01:23:38,042 --> 01:23:40,169
the little head tells
the big head what to do...

1120
01:23:40,244 --> 01:23:42,337
and that the big head
should think twice about it.

1121
01:23:43,414 --> 01:23:45,405
All right.

1122
01:23:45,482 --> 01:23:46,915
Be careful.

1123
01:25:17,941 --> 01:25:20,034
- You okay?
- No.

1124
01:25:20,110 --> 01:25:22,237
My brother got beat up
in your neighborhood.

1125
01:25:22,312 --> 01:25:23,574
What?

1126
01:25:23,647 --> 01:25:25,945
Yesterday, some Italian guys
beat up my brother...

1127
01:25:26,016 --> 01:25:27,415
in your neighborhood.

1128
01:25:27,484 --> 01:25:30,749
- What's that have to do with me?
- Were you there?

1129
01:25:30,821 --> 01:25:34,621
- No, I wasn't there.
- Please don't lie to me.

1130
01:25:34,691 --> 01:25:36,955
I'm telling you the truth.
I wasn't there.

1131
01:25:37,027 --> 01:25:40,190
We'll see who's Iying.
My brother's in the car.

1132
01:25:40,264 --> 01:25:43,392
I told him I was going out with
an Italian, so he came along.

1133
01:25:43,467 --> 01:25:46,061
He recognized you
and said you beat him up.

1134
01:25:46,136 --> 01:25:49,196
- You did that to his face.
- I didn't touch your brother.

1135
01:25:49,273 --> 01:25:50,604
Believe me.

1136
01:25:50,674 --> 01:25:52,665
Okay, we'll see.

1137
01:26:01,084 --> 01:26:02,949
We'll get this straight
right now.

1138
01:26:11,628 --> 01:26:13,186
Yeah, that's him.

1139
01:26:15,132 --> 01:26:17,123
- You did this to me.
- I didn't do anything...

1140
01:26:17,201 --> 01:26:18,793
- Yes, you did!
- I didn't.

1141
01:26:18,869 --> 01:26:20,928
- Are you sure it was him?
- I'm positive!

1142
01:26:21,004 --> 01:26:23,472
Don't believe him.
I didn't touch him.

1143
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:26,441
- So you were there?
- But I didn't do anything.

1144
01:26:26,510 --> 01:26:29,741
- Believe me.
- You told me you weren't there!

1145
01:26:29,813 --> 01:26:31,838
It was the other guys.
I tried to help him.

1146
01:26:31,915 --> 01:26:34,907
- How did my eye get like this?
- I tried to help you!

1147
01:26:34,985 --> 01:26:37,749
- Bullshit, man!
- You know I didn't do anything.

1148
01:26:37,821 --> 01:26:40,187
- Why were you on top of me?
- It was the others!

1149
01:26:40,257 --> 01:26:43,283
- It was you!
- I was the only one helping you.

1150
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:44,987
This is how you repay me?

1151
01:26:45,062 --> 01:26:47,155
Fuck that! No, fuck you, man!

1152
01:26:47,231 --> 01:26:50,359
I didn't do anything!
Fuck you, you fucking nigger!

1153
01:26:54,204 --> 01:26:57,571
See what I'm talking about?
Just like the rest of them!

1154
01:27:52,930 --> 01:27:55,023
How come you're back so fast?

1155
01:27:55,098 --> 01:27:57,589
The keys are in the car.
I got to go.

1156
01:27:57,668 --> 01:28:00,330
Wait. Come here. What happened?

1157
01:28:00,404 --> 01:28:03,032
It just didn't work out.
I got to go.

1158
01:28:03,106 --> 01:28:05,404
- What happened with the girl?
- Everything went wrong.

1159
01:28:05,475 --> 01:28:07,773
You want to go to the track?

1160
01:28:07,844 --> 01:28:10,745
No. I don't want to talk.
I got to go.

1161
01:28:10,814 --> 01:28:12,406
C, you sure?

1162
01:28:12,482 --> 01:28:15,007
- Come on.
- Maybe next time, Sonny.

1163
01:28:20,324 --> 01:28:22,588
Come on.

1164
01:28:22,659 --> 01:28:25,457
Take my car.
Bobby, you drive.

1165
01:28:25,529 --> 01:28:26,860
Okay, Sonny.

1166
01:28:51,688 --> 01:28:53,656
Why are you driving Sonny's car?

1167
01:28:53,724 --> 01:28:57,125
- What are you talking about?
- I saw you driving his car.

1168
01:28:57,194 --> 01:29:00,459
- I don't want you driving his car.
- I'm not in the mood to hear this.

1169
01:29:00,530 --> 01:29:02,998
I don't care. We already
talked about the bikers...

1170
01:29:03,066 --> 01:29:05,000
and that fight in that bar.

1171
01:29:05,068 --> 01:29:07,536
- I don't want you in that bar.
- Should I have run away?

1172
01:29:07,604 --> 01:29:10,971
- Make them think I got no heart?
- You think those guys care?

1173
01:29:11,041 --> 01:29:13,009
What make you think
you're so special?

1174
01:29:13,076 --> 01:29:15,203
- You don't know Sonny.
- I know how he thinks.

1175
01:29:15,278 --> 01:29:17,269
You fuck up,
he'll hurt you like anybody.

1176
01:29:17,347 --> 01:29:20,009
- Sonny trusts me.
- He can't trust anybody.

1177
01:29:20,083 --> 01:29:23,109
The sooner you know that the better.
How often do I have to tell you?

1178
01:29:23,186 --> 01:29:25,154
People don't respect him.
They fear him.

1179
01:29:25,222 --> 01:29:27,315
There's a big difference.
You want to be somebody?

1180
01:29:27,391 --> 01:29:30,121
Be somebody who works
and takes cares of his family.

1181
01:29:30,193 --> 01:29:32,661
Yeah, look away. Look...

1182
01:29:32,729 --> 01:29:36,165
You're my only son. I'm looking
out for your best interests.

1183
01:29:36,233 --> 01:29:38,360
The saddest thing in life
is wasted talent.

1184
01:29:38,435 --> 01:29:42,428
- I don't want to hear this.
- You're going to hear it.

1185
01:29:42,506 --> 01:29:44,838
I might not have money,
I might not have a Cadillac...

1186
01:29:44,908 --> 01:29:46,933
but I don't have to
look over my shoulder.

1187
01:29:47,010 --> 01:29:49,604
I don't answer to anybody. My
parents came here with nothing...

1188
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:51,977
And they died with nothing.

1189
01:29:52,049 --> 01:29:55,109
Don't you dare disrespect your
grandparents! Do you hear me?

1190
01:29:55,185 --> 01:29:57,619
And you're wrong. They tried
to give me a better life.

1191
01:29:57,687 --> 01:29:59,985
- I'm trying to-
- What better life?

1192
01:30:00,057 --> 01:30:03,151
We don't own a car! We ain't got money!
We ain't got nothing!

1193
01:30:03,226 --> 01:30:06,389
Don't take it out on me
because you're a bus driver.

1194
01:30:06,463 --> 01:30:08,055
The working man is a sucker!

1195
01:30:23,046 --> 01:30:26,641
Hey, C. Look what these black
motherfuckers did to our club.

1196
01:30:26,716 --> 01:30:29,913
You believe the balls on them,
throwing eggs at our club?

1197
01:30:29,986 --> 01:30:33,353
Get in the car.
We're going to go fuck them up.

1198
01:30:33,423 --> 01:30:35,220
Get in the car.

1199
01:30:37,494 --> 01:30:38,893
Sonny and Jimmy!

1200
01:30:38,962 --> 01:30:42,898
Oh, shit! Back off!
Get out of here!

1201
01:30:42,966 --> 01:30:44,593
What's going on?

1202
01:30:46,269 --> 01:30:48,328
After you picked up my car,
where did you go?

1203
01:30:48,405 --> 01:30:51,374
I drove around and went
to pick up Jane. Why?

1204
01:30:51,441 --> 01:30:53,341
Was there really a Jane?

1205
01:30:53,410 --> 01:30:55,037
Sonny, what is it?

1206
01:30:55,112 --> 01:30:57,512
After you dropped that car off,
it didn't start.

1207
01:30:57,581 --> 01:31:00,175
We found something on the
engine. It didn't go off.

1208
01:31:00,250 --> 01:31:05,119
Tell me how that got on there,
and where did you go in my car!

1209
01:31:05,188 --> 01:31:07,952
I picked it up,
I drove right to the school...

1210
01:31:08,024 --> 01:31:09,753
and I locked the doors
like you told me.

1211
01:31:09,826 --> 01:31:12,761
Don't lie to me!
Where did you go with my car?

1212
01:31:12,829 --> 01:31:15,263
I didn't do anything!
I swear! Please!

1213
01:31:15,332 --> 01:31:18,961
- Don't lie to me!
- I didn't do anything!

1214
01:31:19,035 --> 01:31:22,801
I swear, I just went right
to the school and that was it!

1215
01:31:22,873 --> 01:31:24,807
I swear to God!
Why would I hurt you?

1216
01:31:24,875 --> 01:31:26,809
You've been like a father to me!

1217
01:31:40,023 --> 01:31:42,821
Calogero? Hey!

1218
01:31:45,929 --> 01:31:48,227
- What happened to my son?
- Go drive your bus.

1219
01:31:48,298 --> 01:31:51,392
- Don't tell me to drive my bus!
- Take it easy!

1220
01:31:51,468 --> 01:31:53,561
Touch me and I'll stick you
in the fucking ground!

1221
01:31:56,806 --> 01:32:00,333
Next time find out what's going
on before you open your mouth.

1222
01:32:16,393 --> 01:32:18,088
Come here.

1223
01:32:25,835 --> 01:32:29,032
- What happened with you and Sonny?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

1224
01:32:29,105 --> 01:32:30,697
Where'd you get this car?

1225
01:32:30,774 --> 01:32:33,004
Don't worry about it.
We borrowed it.

1226
01:32:37,147 --> 01:32:39,342
Slow down!

1227
01:32:39,416 --> 01:32:41,543
I don't wanna get pinched
before we get there.

1228
01:32:41,618 --> 01:32:44,348
I know. I'm not driver
for nothing.

1229
01:32:44,421 --> 01:32:46,218
We're in a hot car. Slow down.

1230
01:32:46,289 --> 01:32:49,656
I know what I'm doing.
Don't worry about it.

1231
01:32:49,726 --> 01:32:51,216
What's that smell?

1232
01:32:51,294 --> 01:32:53,694
We made those niggers
a cocktail.

1233
01:32:53,763 --> 01:32:56,527
Look at these beauties.

1234
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:59,330
We're going to teach them
a lesson.

1235
01:32:59,402 --> 01:33:03,202
- We're going to finish the job.
- For throwing eggs at our joint.

1236
01:33:03,273 --> 01:33:05,707
Ralphie, take this.

1237
01:33:07,844 --> 01:33:09,812
Why don't you give me
the big one?

1238
01:33:09,879 --> 01:33:11,540
Take that and shut up!

1239
01:33:11,615 --> 01:33:15,551
I'll take these motherfuckers!
I hate them! I'll kill them!

1240
01:33:15,619 --> 01:33:18,417
What are you doing,
lighting a cigarette?

1241
01:33:18,488 --> 01:33:21,321
- Relax.
- You got the cocktails in here.

1242
01:33:21,391 --> 01:33:25,054
Relax. I know what I'm doing.

1243
01:33:25,128 --> 01:33:27,892
I can't wait to see the look
on those motherfuckers' faces.

1244
01:33:27,964 --> 01:33:29,932
I can't wait.

1245
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,766
They were smiling. I was too,
but I was dying inside.

1246
01:33:35,071 --> 01:33:38,507
I wanted out, but I
couldn't get out of the car.

1247
01:33:38,575 --> 01:33:40,566
What was I going to say?
"Let me out. I'm afraid."

1248
01:33:40,644 --> 01:33:42,578
You better use that gun.

1249
01:33:42,646 --> 01:33:44,580
I could never go back
to that neighborhood.

1250
01:33:44,648 --> 01:33:47,344
They would call me a punk,
a dog, a mutt.

1251
01:33:47,417 --> 01:33:49,351
They would say I got no heart.

1252
01:33:49,419 --> 01:33:53,583
I kept hearing my father's voice
in my head. "Don't blow it, son.

1253
01:33:53,657 --> 01:33:57,423
These people will hurt you.
Don't waste your talent."

1254
01:33:57,494 --> 01:33:59,587
Then I kept hearing
Sonny's voice.

1255
01:33:59,663 --> 01:34:04,532
"Be careful, C. Don't lose it.
Keep your head."

1256
01:34:04,601 --> 01:34:07,593
Somebody pulled the chain,
and I was going down the toilet.

1257
01:34:14,878 --> 01:34:16,812
They want to throw eggs
at our club?

1258
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:18,643
We'll give them
a big surprise.

1259
01:34:22,485 --> 01:34:24,476
C, out of the car.

1260
01:34:24,554 --> 01:34:27,785
- He's with us.
- Mind your business. Get out.

1261
01:34:27,857 --> 01:34:30,257
Come on. He's with us.

1262
01:34:30,327 --> 01:34:32,420
Come on. Move.

1263
01:34:37,334 --> 01:34:39,894
For the last time,
stay away from this kid.

1264
01:35:05,428 --> 01:35:08,591
I can't believe it.
You don't even trust me?

1265
01:35:08,665 --> 01:35:11,133
Listen. It's not
that I don't trust you.

1266
01:35:11,201 --> 01:35:15,831
I won't listen. You don't even
believe there was a Jane.

1267
01:35:15,905 --> 01:35:18,135
Couldn't it have been in the car
when I picked it up?

1268
01:35:18,208 --> 01:35:21,939
Me and Jane could have gotten
killed. You never thought that, did you?

1269
01:35:24,614 --> 01:35:26,343
Don't you trust anybody?

1270
01:35:29,753 --> 01:35:31,687
It's a horrible way to live.

1271
01:35:32,889 --> 01:35:35,153
For me, it's the only way.

1272
01:35:35,225 --> 01:35:36,783
Not for me.

1273
01:35:57,480 --> 01:35:59,710
Some fine-looking black chick
was just here looking for you.

1274
01:35:59,783 --> 01:36:03,082
- She just left?
- If you hurry, you'll catch her.

1275
01:36:03,153 --> 01:36:04,620
Come here.

1276
01:36:04,687 --> 01:36:06,621
Told you.

1277
01:36:09,092 --> 01:36:11,322
You want me to go get him?

1278
01:36:11,394 --> 01:36:12,827
No, leave him alone.

1279
01:36:19,302 --> 01:36:22,829
My brother told me the truth.
You did try to help him.

1280
01:36:22,906 --> 01:36:24,339
I told you.

1281
01:36:24,407 --> 01:36:26,898
I know. But he
took it out on you.

1282
01:36:26,976 --> 01:36:29,376
It's okay.
I understand how he felt.

1283
01:36:29,446 --> 01:36:31,471
I'm glad you understand.

1284
01:36:35,985 --> 01:36:39,011
Mind your own business!
Get back in your house!

1285
01:36:41,391 --> 01:36:43,882
Let them stare.
Give me your hand.

1286
01:36:46,062 --> 01:36:47,552
Give me your hand.

1287
01:36:52,502 --> 01:36:54,561
- Glad you came to see me.
- I missed you.

1288
01:36:54,637 --> 01:36:56,104
I missed you too.

1289
01:36:58,875 --> 01:37:00,775
I think you're beautiful.

1290
01:37:01,778 --> 01:37:03,473
Stop.

1291
01:37:03,546 --> 01:37:05,036
No, I really do.

1292
01:37:06,749 --> 01:37:09,946
I want to be with you,
and I don't care what anybody says.

1293
01:37:11,087 --> 01:37:14,784
- Can I have a kiss?
- Sure.

1294
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:25,534
That's not a kiss.

1295
01:37:26,603 --> 01:37:28,298
This is a kiss.

1296
01:37:41,017 --> 01:37:43,577
Do you know how to make sauce?

1297
01:37:43,653 --> 01:37:45,450
What?

1298
01:37:45,522 --> 01:37:47,456
You know, sauce for macaroni.

1299
01:37:49,459 --> 01:37:50,448
Shut up.

1300
01:38:03,439 --> 01:38:05,407
I'm really sorry
about what happened.

1301
01:38:07,043 --> 01:38:09,204
- My brother didn't mean it.
- Where's your car?

1302
01:38:09,279 --> 01:38:11,679
Give me the keys! We got to go!

1303
01:38:11,748 --> 01:38:14,683
- What are you talking about?
- We got to get there.

1304
01:38:34,437 --> 01:38:36,405
I knew you were
one of the great ones.

1305
01:38:36,472 --> 01:38:38,872
Great ones?
What are you talking about?

1306
01:38:38,942 --> 01:38:40,876
Never mind.
It's an Italian thing.

1307
01:38:51,654 --> 01:38:54,214
Hurry up.
Make a U-turn over here.

1308
01:38:55,458 --> 01:38:56,891
Go by in front.

1309
01:38:59,295 --> 01:39:01,320
What are they doing
in our neighborhood?

1310
01:39:49,379 --> 01:39:51,313
Get it out!

1311
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:46,261
Be careful, guys.

1312
01:40:46,335 --> 01:40:48,098
- What's happening?
- What happened?

1313
01:40:48,171 --> 01:40:51,663
- Four white guys just got blown up.
- White guys got killed, that's what.

1314
01:41:00,717 --> 01:41:02,582
Willy, are you all right?

1315
01:41:04,253 --> 01:41:06,187
Yeah, I'm all right.

1316
01:41:12,228 --> 01:41:15,459
They started out as white boys.
Now they are toast.

1317
01:41:15,531 --> 01:41:18,557
They look better now, right?

1318
01:41:18,634 --> 01:41:22,195
They left something for you
in the trunk! Take a look.

1319
01:41:22,271 --> 01:41:24,501
Get out of our neighborhood!

1320
01:41:24,574 --> 01:41:26,735
Fucking pussy-ass motherfucker!

1321
01:41:26,809 --> 01:41:29,300
Don't say shit, man!

1322
01:41:29,378 --> 01:41:31,346
Get out of the neighborhood!

1323
01:41:33,549 --> 01:41:37,849
Sometimes when I think about it I don't
know if I should've been happy or sad.

1324
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:39,717
Happy because I was alive...

1325
01:41:39,789 --> 01:41:42,257
or sad because
my friends were dead.

1326
01:41:43,626 --> 01:41:45,890
But one thing I knew was
I was grateful.

1327
01:41:45,962 --> 01:41:47,930
Grateful because of Sonny.

1328
01:41:49,132 --> 01:41:51,862
Listen, Jane, I got to go.

1329
01:41:51,934 --> 01:41:53,561
- You okay?
- Yeah, man.

1330
01:41:53,636 --> 01:41:57,333
- Listen, I'm sorry.
- Jive-ass white motherfucker!

1331
01:41:57,406 --> 01:41:59,840
You don't understand.
I was in that car.

1332
01:41:59,909 --> 01:42:02,343
Just go. The boys
are about to go crazy.

1333
01:42:02,411 --> 01:42:05,847
What are you looking at?
Fuck that bitch too!

1334
01:42:07,350 --> 01:42:08,408
Go.

1335
01:42:11,654 --> 01:42:13,679
Get the fuck out of
the neighborhood!

1336
01:42:40,950 --> 01:42:42,941
He saved my life.

1337
01:42:55,431 --> 01:42:57,399
I had to tell him.

1338
01:42:57,466 --> 01:43:00,094
I wanted to thank Sonny.
He saved my life.

1339
01:43:12,648 --> 01:43:14,741
C, I swear,
my grandmother's still sick.

1340
01:43:14,817 --> 01:43:16,751
I'll give you the 20 next week.

1341
01:43:16,819 --> 01:43:18,411
Forget the 20!

1342
01:43:32,935 --> 01:43:36,029
- You know where Sonny is?
- I don't care where he is!

1343
01:43:36,105 --> 01:43:38,903
I'm losing here!
Why are you breaking my balls?

1344
01:43:38,975 --> 01:43:40,442
He's in the front.

1345
01:43:43,112 --> 01:43:45,046
C! Come here!

1346
01:43:49,285 --> 01:43:51,048
Let my boy through.

1347
01:43:55,591 --> 01:43:57,957
Come here.

1348
01:43:58,027 --> 01:44:00,996
All I could see
was big smiling faces.

1349
01:44:02,431 --> 01:44:04,524
All of a sudden, out of all
these smiling faces...

1350
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:06,363
there was this one face.

1351
01:44:06,435 --> 01:44:09,131
I couldn't understand why I kept
looking at this one face...

1352
01:44:09,205 --> 01:44:11,696
and then I realized
he wasn't smiling.

1353
01:44:13,109 --> 01:44:15,577
All I could see was this guy...

1354
01:44:15,645 --> 01:44:17,579
and nobody could see him but me.

1355
01:44:20,716 --> 01:44:22,707
Come on, C!

1356
01:44:25,855 --> 01:44:27,254
Come here!

1357
01:44:34,297 --> 01:44:36,765
Get an ambulance!

1358
01:44:56,018 --> 01:44:59,112
The guy that killed Sonny
was the son of the man he killed...

1359
01:44:59,188 --> 01:45:01,247
eight years earlier
in front of my house.

1360
01:45:39,962 --> 01:45:42,556
There were flowers
all over the place.

1361
01:45:42,631 --> 01:45:44,565
Gangsters have this thing
about flowers.

1362
01:45:45,634 --> 01:45:48,159
Whoever sends the biggest arrangement
cares the most.

1363
01:46:01,083 --> 01:46:04,052
- John and Anthony from Detroit.
- How are you?

1364
01:46:08,024 --> 01:46:10,015
Did you see the way
he went down?

1365
01:46:12,962 --> 01:46:14,987
It was just like
Sonny said it would be.

1366
01:46:16,799 --> 01:46:18,323
Nobody cares.

1367
01:46:37,053 --> 01:46:39,317
I'm sorry,
but we got to close up.

1368
01:46:42,091 --> 01:46:44,184
Could you give me
a couple more minutes?

1369
01:46:44,260 --> 01:46:46,353
Okay. I'll be in my office.

1370
01:47:07,750 --> 01:47:10,184
How are you doing, Sonny?

1371
01:47:10,252 --> 01:47:11,810
Not so good, huh?

1372
01:47:13,389 --> 01:47:15,482
She passed the test.
That's what I wanted to tell you.

1373
01:47:16,559 --> 01:47:18,493
She might be
my first great one.

1374
01:47:20,062 --> 01:47:23,259
I'm going to go out with her.
Thanks for helping me.

1375
01:47:24,700 --> 01:47:26,668
Thank you for saving my life.

1376
01:47:26,735 --> 01:47:28,669
I never got a chance
to tell you.

1377
01:47:30,406 --> 01:47:34,706
They all died.
Slick, Aldo, Mario, Ralphie.

1378
01:47:34,777 --> 01:47:36,210
All of them.

1379
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:42,976
Sorry. I thought I was alone.
I'm just thinking out loud.

1380
01:47:43,052 --> 01:47:45,043
That's okay.
It's understandable.

1381
01:47:49,158 --> 01:47:52,150
This man is a great man.
He saved my life.

1382
01:47:58,200 --> 01:48:01,169
- You Lorenzo the bus driver's kid?
- Yeah.

1383
01:48:01,237 --> 01:48:03,228
- C, right?
- Yeah.

1384
01:48:03,305 --> 01:48:05,239
Sonny told me all about you.

1385
01:48:05,307 --> 01:48:07,605
Sorry, but I don't
even know who you are.

1386
01:48:08,477 --> 01:48:10,001
My name is Carmine.

1387
01:48:11,080 --> 01:48:13,514
We go back a long way together,
Sonny and me.

1388
01:48:15,317 --> 01:48:17,285
He saved my life too once.

1389
01:48:21,957 --> 01:48:23,948
You don't remember me, do you?

1390
01:48:25,861 --> 01:48:28,523
Many years ago?
In front of your house?

1391
01:48:29,999 --> 01:48:32,058
You don't remember this?

1392
01:48:32,134 --> 01:48:36,264
You were the guy who got hit
with the baseball bat, right?

1393
01:48:37,339 --> 01:48:39,068
Yeah, I remember.

1394
01:48:39,141 --> 01:48:41,109
I was there.
I saw the whole thing.

1395
01:48:41,177 --> 01:48:42,701
I know, kid.

1396
01:48:44,079 --> 01:48:46,013
Sonny told me what you did.

1397
01:48:47,016 --> 01:48:50,281
Listen, I've been away.

1398
01:48:50,352 --> 01:48:54,220
But I'll be in the neighborhood
taking care of things for a while.

1399
01:48:54,290 --> 01:48:57,919
You need anything, come and
see me at the bar, okay?

1400
01:48:57,993 --> 01:49:01,793
I think I'll give the bar a rest
for a while, but thanks anyway.

1401
01:49:01,864 --> 01:49:03,297
It's okay. I understand.

1402
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:06,868
Was that fight really over
a parking space?

1403
01:49:24,253 --> 01:49:26,483
Don't forget.
You need anything, come see me.

1404
01:49:27,856 --> 01:49:30,154
- Anything.
- All right.

1405
01:49:30,226 --> 01:49:31,716
So long, kid.

1406
01:49:43,939 --> 01:49:45,873
Dad, what are you doing here?

1407
01:49:49,712 --> 01:49:51,646
I came to pay my respects
to your friend.

1408
01:49:53,949 --> 01:49:55,416
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1409
01:49:55,484 --> 01:49:58,146
I'm sorry if I ever hurt you
in any way.

1410
01:50:00,489 --> 01:50:01,922
It's okay.

1411
01:50:03,025 --> 01:50:04,959
Everything's gonna be okay.

1412
01:50:13,936 --> 01:50:16,769
I want to thank you
for saving my kid's life.

1413
01:50:20,976 --> 01:50:23,035
I never hated you.
I guess it's...

1414
01:50:24,446 --> 01:50:27,643
that I was mad at you because
you made him grow up so fast.

1415
01:50:32,655 --> 01:50:34,646
May God have mercy on your soul.

1416
01:50:39,662 --> 01:50:41,095
I'll wait over here.

1417
01:50:46,302 --> 01:50:47,860
Did you hear that?

1418
01:50:49,171 --> 01:50:51,139
My father didn't hate you.

1419
01:50:53,175 --> 01:50:54,665
Nobody cares, huh?

1420
01:50:56,679 --> 01:50:58,647
You were wrong about that one.

1421
01:51:04,620 --> 01:51:06,053
Wasted talent.

1422
01:51:11,293 --> 01:51:12,760
See you around.

1423
01:51:22,638 --> 01:51:24,162
Let's go home, C.

1424
01:51:31,146 --> 01:51:33,171
Sonny and my father
always said...

1425
01:51:33,248 --> 01:51:35,239
that when I get older
I would understand.

1426
01:51:36,318 --> 01:51:38,445
Well, I finally did.

1427
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:40,818
I learned something
from these two men.

1428
01:51:40,889 --> 01:51:44,017
I learned to give love
and get love unconditionally.

1429
01:51:44,093 --> 01:51:46,220
You just have to accept people
for what they are.

1430
01:51:47,463 --> 01:51:49,624
And I learned
the greatest gift of all.

1431
01:51:49,698 --> 01:51:52,599
The saddest thing in life
is wasted talent.

1432
01:51:53,736 --> 01:51:57,035
And the choices that you make
will shape your life forever.

1433
01:51:58,574 --> 01:52:00,633
But you can ask anybody
from my neighborhood...

1434
01:52:00,709 --> 01:52:02,677
and they'll just tell you.

1435
01:52:02,745 --> 01:52:04,713
This is just another Bronx tale.

1436
02:00:58,480 --> 02:01:04,214
