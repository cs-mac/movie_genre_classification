Kevin, how many times
have I had to tell you...

it's pointless for you humans

That's pathetic, Kev. How many times
you gonna fall for that one?

185
00:09:52,823 --> 00:09:55,724
I managed to get another week
out of my probation officer, boss.

Come on, boys.
It's grub time.

Where'd you get
that dog food?

Well, I certainly can. It was all
thanks to Dr. Pavlov and his therapy.

Oy, I'm a dog, mate.
Four dogs.

Well, look who's here.

Hello, Kevin.

00:36:31,986 --> 00:36:34,887
- Chloe! [Chuckles] Are you, uh...
- Yeah, I'm going.

625
00:36:34,989 --> 00:36:37,890
- And are these your dalmatians?
- Yeah.

This is Digger, Chomp and Drooler.
- [Oddball Barking]

627

You call that a bark?

This is a bark.
[Snarling, Barking]

629
00:36:46,567 --> 00:36:49,468
[Waddlesworth] That's right.
Go hide behind Mummy.

And... Oddball.
He's not gonna hurt you.

- Your change, sir.
- Oh. Thank you.

- Don't you count your change?
- Well, why should I?

633
00:37:05,352 --> 00:37:07,252
Now it all makes sense.

634
00:37:07,354 --> 00:37:09,254
What?

635
00:37:09,356 --> 00:37:12,382
How you could actually believe
that Cruella De Vil had changed.

636

She has changed.

Hello, Judy!

Everybody would laugh at us!

Oh, you are awful!

will you tell us please?

[Both Grunting]

- Waddlesworth.
- Oddball!

00:38:56,029 --> 00:38:59,226
Now's your chance. You fly up there
and just cut a few strings.

672
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:02,029
- Not all of them!
- Right, just a few!
Come on, Waddlesworth!

- You can do it! Fly!
- No! Owww!

Oh.

- Oh, Kevin,
I don't know how to thank you.
- Oops.

00:39:48,081 --> 00:39:49,605
Uh, how about dinner?

684
00:39:51,385 --> 00:39:53,285
Sorry?

685
00:39:54,555 --> 00:39:56,455
I was inviting you
to dinner.

686
00:39:59,893 --> 00:40:01,793
Dinner would be nice.

[Thunder Crashing]

688
00:40:07,384 --> 00:40:10,478
A coat
to make the world "shuvver."

689
00:40:10,588 --> 00:40:13,148
"Shudder."
"Shutter"?

a special something...

00:40:25,603 --> 00:40:29,164
for three special puppies.

Too dressy?

00:40:35,179 --> 00:40:37,079
Too dressy.

699
00:40:37,181 --> 00:40:41,015
Too stuffy.
Too small. Too blue.

700

Dottie, I've got nothing to wear.
Please help me.

- Dottie, are you sure?

It's completely
see-through. Look.

00:40:53,864 --> 00:40:56,332
Oddball.
Yeah, that's a sweater.

705

What a fantastic idea!

Thank you!
[Kissing]

708
00:41:02,873 --> 00:41:04,807
Thanks, Oddball.

My brilliance
astounds me.

[LePelt]
No. No.

711
00:41:09,446 --> 00:41:12,347
- We should add
the "poopies" to the hem.
- Oh, you wouldn't dare.

712
00:41:12,449 --> 00:41:14,349
But this is
last year's length!

713
00:41:14,451 --> 00:41:17,113
If Cruella De Vil draws it,
it defines length.

00:41:19,723 --> 00:41:21,657
No. No!

715

- No...

Forty dalmatian puppies...

00:41:31,635 --> 00:41:34,229
sh-shipped off to Paris...

719
00:41:34,338 --> 00:41:35,999
to h-his shop.

- Not enough.
- We need 102.

00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:42,811
This time I want
a hooded spotted puppy coat.

722
00:41:42,913 --> 00:41:46,314
- Hooded spotted p-puppy coat?
- "Hooded spotted poopie coat?"

723
00:41:46,417 --> 00:41:48,851
[Alonzo] But 99 puppies
would make a lovely coat.

- It's not that easy to steal...
- Steal? Who said anything
about steal?

725
00:41:52,957 --> 00:41:56,188
What did you think, LePelt,
that we'd have time to breed them?

726
00:41:56,293 --> 00:41:58,193
Skinning is one thing...

727
00:41:58,295 --> 00:42:00,195
but stealing...

728
00:42:00,297 --> 00:42:01,855
Oh, stop whining.

00:42:01,966 --> 00:42:03,866
I have
a perfectly good idiot...

00:42:03,968 --> 00:42:06,266
to take the fall.

Oh, right.

Chomp's brought his favorite video.
Is that all right?

Is it suitable
for the children?

Yes. Beautiful.

So, where was I? Oh, yes.
